Your mom just needs to take a break, that's all. - Good night, Auntie Judith. - Good night, love bug. You get under the covers. Hmm... Sleep tight. I'm going to destroy you, you maniac! Leave, before I call the police! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Mommy? Mommy? What's going on? - Alex! - Mommy! - Alex! - Sam, you're killing me. It's been years since I dreamt about it. - Hey, you're the one who opened it up for discussion. By the way, I am charging you for this. - Oh, that's real nice. I'm not that scared little 6-year-old anymore, you know? You know what? You owe me some freebies, so I'm collecting. - All right. So what all happened while I was away? - Well, be proud of me. I'm taking control of my life. - Whoa, whoa. Now I'm afraid. What's up? - I'm divorcing Dan and I'm moving back into the brownstone. - Whoa, whoa. Stop. Come on. Let's hear it. What's up? - Look, this is what you get for being a world-reknowned psychiatrist and being on a lecture tour for 2 months. Just be happy for me, Sam. - I'm elated you're leaving Dan. You shouldn't have married him. But as a psychiatrist-- - I know what you think: That's why I had this dream, and I shouldn't move into the brownstone. But trust me on this. I know what I'm doing. - That's not what I'm afraid of. - Come on, old man! - Old man? I'll show you some old man! I'm so charging you for this! - Hi, J.J. - Hey, Mrs. Lambeth! How was the jog this morning? - The park was beautiful. I got you this. - This is why you're my favorite tenant. Always thinking of my stomach. Good morning, Mr. Lambeth. - Take care of my lovely wife, J.J. - Please, Dan. What the hell's going on in here? - Mrs. Lambeth, Jacob Anderson. Mr. Lambeth hired us to take inventory of the assets for the divorce. We'll be out of here in a few hours. - Mr. Hickson, please. Alexandra Lambeth. He no longer represents me? A conflict of interest? Thank you. - No, I'm sorry. You can't take that. - It was my aunt's. I came into the marriage with it, I'm leaving with it. OK? - Fine. - So what else did my husband take out of the apartment? - Some personal effects. - Oh, I see. - I've been asked to inform you that this apartment is part of Tregold's holdings. Therefore it doesn't belong to you or your husband. The company will be assuming occupancy as of the 14th and you'll be asked to surrender your keys by then. - Oh, really? I'd like to do that now. - Mrs. Lambeth-- - It's Kent. Miss Kent. - Mrs. Kent-- - I don't want any of it, all right? I'll just be upstairs collecting some of my personal effects. - Well, there's one last thing. I've been asked to inform you that your invitation to the children's charity reception still stands. - Because you're no longer sitting on my couch paying me for my advice, as I friend, I get to say this. I don't think you should live here. - You know, you're starting to sound like a parrot. I love you for it. I really thank you for clearing your schedule to do this. - I wouldn't let you exorcise this beast alone. - It's just a house. With the changes I've made, it's now my house. Come on. - Hey... You all right? - Yes, I'm fine. It looks great, huh? - Um-hmm. - Miss Kent? Still have a few things to fix, but we're pretty much done in the living room. - You did a great job, Ed. - Thanks. No real structural problems except the 2nd floor. We moved the rest of the furniture up to the attic like you requested. And everything's been rewired to bring you up to code. Let me show you the pool. We've totally upgraded it. I really think you're going to like it. She's a beauty, huh? Sealed two streamline cracks, but they weren't a problem. A little tempermental to clean... Come, I'll show you upstairs. - Bye, Sammy. - Everything looks real good. - All right, I'll call you later. - All right, honey. Bye-bye. - Uh, Ed? Uh... Glad you're here. I believe I owe you this. - Oh, thanks. - Wow... - Miss Kent, can I ask about the key? - Oh, I'm gonna need a set... - No, I meant the rose around your neck. - Um sorry, but this isn't a key. - May I? Sure. - Oh yeah. This looks like a pendant. Watch. - I never knew! - I saw my first one about 20 years ago. It was a butterfly, and I've seen 3 others. - How did you-- - It's become a fascination with me. It was made back in '29, after the Market crashed. This very famous locksmith, Stanley Gruman, he was hired by some of society's elite to hide the keys to vault rooms in pendants. - To a vault room? - A hidden room in the house where they would store valuables. Behind a false wall in a cellar or attic. Sort of pride myself on finding them. I'd be very happy to look for it if you'd like. - No, that won't be necessary. Thank you. - I've taken care of the new artists and the Bowen exhibits. The gallery will be fine without you for a few days. Even the boss deserves time off. - Oh, I'd better be careful. You just might replace me. - Yeah well, I am getting a little addicted to the power, you know? - Miss Kent? Can I have a word? - Sure. - Your check was returned. - That's not possible. I'll take care of it, OK? - I'm going to cut my crew down until you do. Sorry. All right guys, let's wrap it up. - Yeah. Really... I understand. - So? What's the Prince Charming update? - Well, he froze all of our accounts. I have zero money. - You're taking this very well. You are going to fight him? - No, I'm not going to fight him. That's exactly what he wants. I'll just draw a paycheck from the gallery. - Welcome to the fabulous land of high credit card debt and week-to-week living. You'll love it. Forget Dan. - Yeah, forget Dan. - Besides, you have a mysterious key! - I do have a mysterious key! You're right. To a mysterious room. Come on, let's get some champagne and start looking. Let's start by tapping on the walls. - Tap all you want, I'm going for refills. - Looking, looking... - Looking... - We'd probably do better if we weren't drinking. - Like I'd even be doing this if we weren't. Found some antique dust bunnies! - Where's this damn room? - It's like not being able to finish The Timescrossword. I mean, where does someone hide a whole room? - I have no idea. We looked everywhere. - Yeah. - Don't you have a meeting to go to? - You're really OK living here? - Mmm... Yeah. I'm OK living here. - Oh, when you see Dan, will you smack him for me once? - How about twice? Hey, sweetie. Your shoe is undone here. Don't want you to fall down and hurt yourself. There you go. That's a pretty dress. - Thank you. : Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? Thank you. I just want to take a moment to say welcome and thank you for joining us for our annual children's fundraising event. As you are aware, there are thousands of kids all across this world who lack even the basic necessities of life. And our organization comes together... - You were great with her. Have any kids of your own? - Not so much as a pet or a plant. - I'm Mike Stanheight. - Um, Alexandra Kent. - You close with yours? Your mom? - Listen Mr. Stanheight... You don't know me and I don't know you. - You're right, I'm sorry. It's none of my business. - No harm done. - Occupational hazard. I should wear a neon sign warning, "Head of Psychiatry, Metro General. Run!" - How's that make you feel? - Touché. Well it all started when my father wouldn't allow me to dress up my goldfish Eli-- - Dr. Stanheight, I really should be going back downstairs. But it was nice meeting you. - You too, Miss Kent. - Our office will call you next week. All right? Thank you. - Yeah. All right. - Alex... You look stunning. - Dan, please. You know, you already made your move by taking my lawyer and freezing our bank accounts. Well, here's mine. I remove myself of everything. The money's yours. - Well, don't be ridiculous! We both know that you cannot support yourself. - Wrong about that. I still have the money from my aunt's estate and there's the gallery. It's time we say goodbye. Thank you. - Yeah, it's an awkward time to get a cab. - Oh... - Here, let me try. - Uh, I think you're scaring them away. - I think you're probably right. - See? It's all in the wrist. Thank you, though. - You're welcome. Hey, um... If you ever want to not talk... - Thanks. - And it's Mike. - It was nice to meet you, Mike. - You too. - And it's Alexandra. - Bye. - It's the perfect time. She took her meds and she's out for the night. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Who are you? Who are you? - Alex, I'm sorry. I should have gone over there with you. - No. I needed to go on my own. - Don't... Don't put any faith into this, all right? We've been down this road. Your mother suffers from severe psychotic delusions and paranoia. This is her way of denying what happened. It enables her to live in her world without guilt. - I know. I know. I'm just... I'm just mad at myself. I thought enough time had passed by. He asked me if I missed her and... How do you miss something you never had, you know? I don't have a mother. I never had a mother. - Hey. I'm proud of you. You faced down your fears, you went and saw her. I mean, that had to be really, really difficult. - Yeah. You're a dear friend. Thank you. - I'm sorry. Did I startle you? - What are you doing in my house? - This house. See, I've always loved this house. For years I suggested we move here. Funny how now you decide to do so. - How did you get in? - Don't get upset. I had the contractor make me a set of keys when I paid him. - I want you to leave. - Come on, Ali. I miss you, I need you. - Please, Dan. - Let's stop this. I want you to come home. - I'm taking control of my life now. - You love me. - I did. - You will again. - I won't! - Listen to me, Alexandra! I am not screwing around here! Now, I can make it very difficult for you and make sure you get absolutely nothing! - Fine. 'Cause you don't own me anymore. Give me my keys. - Are you OK? Alex, you scared me! Look at me! Are you all right? - Fine! Fine! - Here, this will take the edge off anything. You're keeping the bottle. - What is it? - It's the 8th wonder - Valium. Don't give me any lip. Swallow. - One? - One. So, what were you trying to do exactly? Break an underwater record or something? - I don't know. I don't know what I was thinking. - Well, after what Dan did tonight, of course your mind would race. I'm staying with you a few days. - Thank you. So, what's going on at the gallery? What's wrong? - Dan took it from you. He had some schlumpy lawyer camped out. He was yanking the poor guy's electronic leash every 10 minutes for an update on your reaction. I didn't have the heart to tell him you'd hadn't been in lately. - Who is he handing the reins to? - Alex, I say go after the gallery. Fight him for it. - It's you? Of course. You're the perfect choice. I'm thinking of opening a gallery of my own. - A gallery costs money. A lot of money. And last I heard, you don't have any. Unless you found that hidden room. - I'll throw a reception here, attract a few investors... some artists... - You know the kind of business we could do here? - We? - Dan! - Sam! To what do I owe this displeasure? - Leave her alone. She's finally got a chance to be happy. Don't take that away from her. - Hmm. Always her protector. You know, you really must be loving this. After all, this is what you've always wanted. Having Alexandra all to yourself. - Oh, come on, Dan! You're tearing her apart, all right? Just grow up and let it go. - I'll tell you what. I'll make you a deal. I'll let her go when you do. Now if you excuse me, I'm late for a meeting. - I couldn't find your coffee. I'll go get some later on. Here you go. Oh, I'll get that. Oh, good morning! She's right here. Alex? - Miss Kent, thank you for understanding. Mr. Lambeth said the two of you were reconciling. I really should have checked with you first. - Yeah, Dan can be very persuasive. Here's the new set of keys. - I guess the silver lining is that we were both paid in full and then some. I can start up again anytime you'd like. - Actually, there's going to be some design changes so if you could give us a couple of days... - Sure. - Oh Ed, do us a favour. Take a picture of us. It'll be a great publicity still for our investors. - A picture of us... Of course! A picture of us. - Is everything all right, Miss Kent? - That's it. There had to be somebody else in this room. - Is something wrong, Alex? - I gotta go. I gotta go. Sorry, Gina. - Thanks. I think you're a really great artist too. Do you want to borrow some of my curlers? - Mother? Mother? - I really like orange. - It's Alexandra. I have to ask you something. Who is this man here? Who is this? You see this picture? It's New Year's Eve. There's you, Aunt Judith, and me. At the Christmas tree. Someone was in this room that night, right? Someone was in this room. So, can you tell me who was in the room? Who took the picture? Somebody had to take the picture, right? Can you tell me who took the picture? Mother, please tell me who took the picture. I need to know who took the picture. Just stop colouring! I don't need you to colour, I want you to answer my question! Who took the picture? Please tell me who took this picture! I need to know! Damn it! What is wrong with you? You got to tell me! No! Please tell me! - You must leave. You're upsetting her. I know you know who took this! - She can't understand you! Please, leave now before I call security! - No! She knows who... - Gentlemen came everyday and little Blue Betty hopped away. She hopped upstairs to make her bed and tumbled down and broke her head. I broke her head! - Calm down! - I broke her head! I broke her head! - Don't let me stop you crying. No analyzing or consoling while I'm on lunch break. Look... I owe you an apology. I should have told you I was Evelyn's doctor. I've been working with your mom about 6 months. I... I like her. I want to help her. I went to that party looking for you. I saw it as a way to unlock some of her mysteries. Maybe plant the seeds for a reconciliation. I don't know. I do know you weren't what I was expecting. Not at all. - I should be going. - If there's anything I can ever do... or not do. - Thanks. Excuse me. - We sedated her. I've never seen her this out of control. Drawing all over everything, fighting with us... She even smashed the mirror in the bathroom. I'll be next door if you need me. - That's it, isn't it? - Don't you understand? Somebody else had to be in that room to take that picture. - You know, I don't want you investing yourself in these pictures. It isn't healthy. They probably used a timer or something. Alex, the past is the past, all right? Just let it go. - It's not that easy, Sam. You should have seen her. It was awful. I've been so angry with her for so many years. I just wanted her to tell me the truth. Tell me what happened. Her mind is gone. She's... ...wasting away. - So you're hoping these pictures, these drawings will give you the answers that you do like to make her a saint or a martyr. Well, let me tell you something, Alex: You can't change what she did or who she is, period. You can't. You cannot. Now, I thought you knew that. - I do. I just opened myself up to her all over again and... Add on the living in the brownstone and Dan... Why am I second guessing myself? - Well, make it simple. Cut her out of your life. You can't allow yourself to feel sorry for her. You made the break that you needed to. So now, sell the brownstone. Let me take care of Dan. - No, I'll handle him. - You need another attorney. One that's not going to sell you out. I'm going to give Brian Segray a call. - I can call him. - Better yet, I'll get you his number. - What? - Oh, where do the years go? You know that you were my first child patient. You were unresponsive, catatonic, but you had a mean right hook. And very sharp teeth. So, you kind of glossed over selling the brownstone. How is it living there anyway? Anything you want to discuss? - Discuss. Nice segue back into doctor-patient. No, I'm not going to sell it. Because then it wins. Besides, I'm getting very comfortable there. A few twinges in the night... It's nothing, though. - Twinges? - I'm invoking my non-patient rights here. - All right. One more comment and I'll let you off the hook. If you live where such a traumatic event occurred it could trigger things in you. Twinges. I want you to promise me that you will come to me if it gets to be too much. - It's getting used to bumps in the night. It's fine. Besides, Gina's staying with me for a while. - Nevertheless, I'd like to prescribe something for you. - Oh, I got that covered. - How so? - Gina gave me some Valium she had. - Not a bad choice. Pretty much what I would have suggested. So, Valium it is. - Good evening, sir. - I'm looking for an Alexandra Kent. Oh, sorry. Lambeth. This is listed as her contact address. I'm her mother's physician. - Hmm. She moved into her family's house on the east side. You tell her J.J. says hi. - You're looking for my wife? I don't believe we've been introduced. Dan Lambeth. - Mike Stanheight. - Yeah, I know who you are. You're mommy dearest's doctor. So tell me, Mike, how is dear old Evelyn these days? - I'm not at liberty to discuss her condition with you. - Hmm. Are you always in the habit of bringing flowers to your patients? Come on, Mike. Using Evelyn to get closer to Ali... It's a novel approach, but it won't work. A word of advice, our separation is merely temporary. - Fortunately, you don't get to make that decision. She does. - Actually, it was first and my last camping experience. More of an electricity and running water kind of girl. - Certainly explains the lack of fire right now. - I wouldn't know how to save my life. - Come on, let me show you. - These are beautiful. - It's the only thing I remember from Scouts. - You were a Scout? - Yeah! Come on. - There you go. Ow! - Ooh! - Ow! - Oh, Jesus Christ! Geez, I don't think you're going to make it. - Ahh... that burns. - Just in case. - Did you learn that in Scouts too? - Well, I'd hate to say you have to have it amputated. - Yeah, that would be bad. I'm really glad you came here. Ah! - Hi, love bug. You're just like me. You're just like me. You're just like me. - It's OK. You're just having a bad dream. - You know, you should go. - Just tell me what it was. - I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I really want you to just not be here. - Gentlemen came every day... Ah! Ah! Little Blue Betty hopped away! - Gina? Gina, are you here? Ah! - Oh. You OK? - Yeah, I... I just... Oh, God. I... I didn't know anybody was here. - Just me and Gina. She's up here, I think. - Thanks. - OK. - Listen, Ed. Let me talk to you for a second. - Yeah? - Well, now really isn't a good time. I was wondering if you could finish the work up here later. - No, that's not good. I've got another job later. - I'm asking if you could like, leave, basically. - Whatever you'd like. - Where's he going? Ed, where are you going? - I asked him to leave. - Hold on, Ed! You can't do that, Alex! You know, I quit my job for this! We need the work done for the gallery! : I don't care! - He'll be back tomorrow. - What were you doing up there? - I was looking for the hidden room. I was mapping layout for gallery storage. You want to see? - No, no. I trust you. Um look, I'm fine staying here by myself. I think Dan's done the worst that he can do. So consider yourself sprung. - Alex... - Mike, I can't talk right now. - Alex, there's been an accident. Your mom's dead. Alex, it was an accident. - You're lying. - She got into the common room. She broke a mirror... - You're lying. - She knicked an artery. Alex! - Why? What if they were more than just drawings? And I didn't believe her? I'm the one that agitated her. - You can't feel responsible for her death, Alex. - But what I'm seeing and what I'm hearing are memories I'm never going to be able to forgive myself. What is it, Sam? I mean, I'm becoming paranoid! I don't want to be like her! - If you really want to get to the bottom of this we can work it through. Break down every detail that you remember with everything that you're experiencing now. Or if you'd like to give it a try, we could regress you. Alex, I want you to just focus on the pendant. Try to look right through it. And breathe... And focus on the pendant. Let the pendant bring you back. The pendant is taking you back. Back... The pendant is taking you back. - Mommy! No! Oh God! Oh my God! - It's OK. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Alex, I'm so sorry. I should have known. I should have known. Alex, you witnessed your mother murder your aunt and then she tried to kill you. Listen. You and I know that you're afraid of becoming like Evelyn. But I think that subconsciously, Alex, you think that you are Evelyn and that you might have even killed. - I would never do that, Sam! - No, no. I know. I agree. - Oh! - But with all the stress that you're under right now with Dan, and your mother, and that brownstone your mind is just having a little trouble adjusting. Now listen, listen. I need you to tell me. Have you had any of these episodes outside of the house? - Sam, you're scaring me! I'm not having a breakdown, Sam! - You're not having a breakdown. Now, the Valium's fine, Alex. But I'd like you to try something more targeted to your own anxiety, all right? I want you to take these for a few days to see how they work for you. If it's a fit, I'll get you a prescription. - OK. - Good. - Thank you. - Listen... I'm going to make the arrangements for your mother. I'll take care of that. And I will get you through this. I promise you. I promise you. - Thank you. - What were you trying to say? - Alex! Alex! Alex! What the hell are you doing? The building inspector's waiting for you downstairs, remember? - Oh my God. Um, just stall him or something. - OK, but hurry up! - Ah... Two... - I've got your current building permits as well as the voided one that was filed in '85. These are standard forms. - Wait. Did you say '85? What was it for? - Well, don't know. But it's the same contractor you're using now. - Oh my God. It was you! It was you, you murderer! You murderer! - What's wrong with you? - Thought you could void the permits to hide yourself? You were wrong! - What's she talking about? - Alex, calm down. He has nothing-- - Was it for the money? The hidden room? Is that why you took advantage of my mentally-ill mother and you murdered my aunt? I should murder you myself! - Go ahead, murder me! Somebody call the cops. This woman's nuts! She needs to be locked up. - Yeah, call the cops! - You see this? I had emergency heart surgery. I was in the hospital the week your aunt was murdered. Don't believe me? Check the hospital records. - Why not tell me you were here before? - Because I didn't want to dredge up any bad memories for you. You know what? You're psychotic. I quit. - Ed, come on! Come on! - Oh, that's good! Go after him! I saw you guys conspiring! I heard the whispering! - OK, you need to get a grip! Ed was helping us off the books! Dan cancelled part of his payment. I figured you already had too much to worry about so I didn't tell you! - I didn't know! I didn't... - Alex, you need to pull yourself together. - You saw her drawings, my aunt's murder. In some of them she drew a man. I want to know if you think he's real. - You're asking me if I believe Evelyn murdered your aunt? - Do you think someone else was there? - I don't think there was. I think she drew him to forgive herself. - Are you saying she made it up? - No, no. Her reality split. She truly believed there was someone else when her mind allowed her to. When it didn't, she saw herself as the killer. A mental break is like two realities overlapping, constantly weaving, so they both seem real. - Two realities? What causes it? - Genetics, severe trauma, any number of things. I can tell you this: I don't believe her true break occurred until after the murder. Give me a second. I want to show you something. - I'm not like her. I'm not like her. Shouldn't there be another index card up there? Or did sleeping with me not give you enough insight into my mother? - Alexandra, it's not what you think. Alex, please wait! - Look, just stay away from me! - Alex, let me explain what you saw. It's a map of your mother's mind. How she processed things. Her two realities. Your last visit with her triggered something. The key to that night, the one thing she'd never drawn. This is the "why". You must want to know. - No, I don't want to know! She was insane, all right? - OK, look, I'm sorry. Look, I won't pursue it either. You're a beautiful, intelligent woman who I want to get to know, not analyze. You have to believe I didn't become intimate with you for any other reason. - I don't know. I just don't want to see you anymore. Hey, Sam. - Oh, hi. I was just coming to see you. - Yeah? What's up? These are her things, huh? - The sanitarium handed them over to me and... I'm sorry. I didn't know how to prepare you for this. OK... What's happening here? - Nothing. It's fine, it's fine. - Stop, stop. Why don't I take these? I don't think this is a good idea for you right now. - No, I got it. It's fine, it's fine. I'm tired. I got it. - OK. Alex... Get some rest, OK? I'll see you tomorrow. - OK, so just make sure these are taken care of and I guess we can fudge the rest. There you go. - Sure. - All right, here's what I got to say. I was way out of line, and I'm truly sorry for that. - Yeah, you were an ass. But I forgive you. - No harm done. I guess I should have told you about the other job, huh? - Thanks. Well, in honour of... - Oh, you'll score a few dates with that one. - You think? I don't know about that. - Oh yeah. - Some champagne? - Thank you. - Have I told you how proud I am of you? You're really doing it. You are taking control of your life. Well, here's to your new gallery. - To the gallery, and to you being in my life. Thanks for coming. - All right. - Can you take this? - OK. - Thanks. - I had them add just a bit of cranberry. I remember how much you enjoyed it. - Yeah. Thanks. I didn't invite you here to become friends. It's not like that we're-- - Ali, I know. We're getting a divorce. I know this. I just thought maybe one drink, one toast? - Oh. Well, one's all you get. - One is all I need. To getting you back. - No. You'll never change. How about... To saying goodbye. - Goodbye, Ali. - Get away from me! Get away from me! Get away from my life! Oh my God! I just don't know what's wrong with me. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I mean, I was fine all day today. Absolutely fine. - Ali, shh... Listen to me. It's going to be all right. Here, just lie back on the couch. Come on. Atta girl. - Thank you. - I'll get you some water. - Thank you. : A little bit of cranberry... I had them add just a little bit of cranberry. I remember how much you enjoyed that. I just thought maybe one drink, one toast? One is all I need. One drink is all I need. Ali... - Oh... - Is everything all right? - I'm just really, really tired. I think sleep is good. I'm just going to go to bed. I'll call you tomorrow. - No, no, no. I'm going to sleep here tonight. And make sure you're all right. - No, I'm fine. I'm completely fine. - I insist, and I will not take no for an answer. Now, come on. - OK. All right. - Here we go. Don't worry about that mess, OK? I'll clean it up. And I'll be right here if you need me, OK? I'll need a pillow. - Right. - You're trembling! - Yeah. - Let's get you tucked into bed. - No, I'm fine. - Good night, Alexandra. - Good night. - Alex? Alex? My God, what have you done? - Sam? - I'm her doctor. OK, let's get up now. Slowly, slowly... Hey, hey... It's me. Alex... I've hired the best criminal lawyer in the city. And we are going to get you out of this. I promise. I just wish you'd listened to me about Dan. Everything's going to be all right. Just rest now. Now you just rest. : Dr. Keane, call your service... - What happened to your hand? - Playing tennis. I'd like to handle Alexandra's treatment before she's transferred. - I understand. I'll get it OK'd with the ward. Give me a couple of days. - It's been cleared. I'll bring her file with me tomorrow. I've noted the Haldol dosage on her chart. - She'll be out a couple of hours. I'll take a run at her later today. - That won't be necessary. I'll be the only one working with her. Just keep her sedated 'till the morning. The rest will do her good. : Dr. Howley, please report to Radiology. Dr. Peter Howley. - Mind if I show you something? Evelyn started drawing this after Alexandra's first visit. Does it mean anything to you? I can't seem to figure it out. - Mike, you're a doctor with a bright future. Don't make the same mistake I did by dwelling on a patient that you can no longer help. - How are you feeling? - Like garbage. - At least you're awake. Listen, I have to ask: If you'd prefer another doctor... - No. - Dr. Bradburn's bringing your files down tomorrow. I've got his notation on your chart that you're on Haldol. He forgot to write down the dosage. Do you know what it was? Was it a blue or a green pill? - Uh... It was a anti-anxiety medication. - When did you stop the Haldol? - I was never prescribed it. - Can you describe the anti-anxiety pill? - Uh... I don't know. It was... ...square and round. Uh, yellow and round. I don't know... - You OK? You want a glass of water? I'm your doctor now. I want to be your friend. - I don't remember killing Dan. - Look, I'm a little confused about the medication you were taking. Do you recognize the pill? That can't be it. Alex, what's happening? Alex, talk to me. - He gave me the pills. - Who? - He killed her. - Who, Alex? - The tapes, the tapes. I know where the tapes are. - Who? - Oh my God! - Who, Alex? - I remember her yelling, screaming 'cause she was going to destroy him. - Who, Alex? - He killed her! He killed my aunt! - I want to help you. I'm going to leave this for you, OK? I want you to write everything down. Make it clear. I got to check some things out. I'll be back in a couple of hours and we'll discuss this, OK? Kelly. Have her blood drawn. I want to know what residual drugs are in her system. Add a request for Haldol levels. See if you can work some of your magic and have the lab put a rush on it. - No problem. I'll do that for you. - Thanks. - Wait! Hold on! - Dr. Stanheight? Here are the labs you wanted. - You're the best. Hi, this is Dr. Mike Stanheight over at Metro General. I just admitted a patient who is on staff over there. I need to know what medications he's currently taking. Samuel Bradburn. How you doing? - I'm ready to talk. - Tell me what you believe has happened. - I believe Sam murdered my aunt and blamed my mother. He's played with my memories, changed my thinking, and... I believe he switched the Valium that I was taking with some other medication to make me think that I was going crazy. So that if I ever did remember anything, everybody would just not believe me. He murdered Dan to frame me. - Tell me what you know. - I know I'm not insane. - The lab found no traces of Haldol in your system. But did find large amounts of Penatral, a blood pressure medication. Given in high doses, it's known to create hallucinations, even psychotic episodes in people without high blood pressure. You'd never be prescribed that medication. I know for a fact, Sam was. But there's no way to prove that he gave it to you. You're not insane. I did a little digging. I discovered that Sam isolated and overmedicated Evelyn for years after the murder. His course of treatment made it sure that no one would be able to unlock what was in her head. Again, it doesn't prove anything except possible patient neglect. Bradburn's a very highly-regarded figure in the psychiatric community. Proving anything's going to be difficult. - The tape's in the brownstone. I don't know where the room is, but I've got the key. - Bye. - I'm taking her down for an MRI while there's no traffic. - Hold on. I'll call someone to go down with you. - Down worry about it. I sedated her. Won't be conscious till morning. I'll have her back in 30. - No, I think I should call somebody. - The amount of drugs I shot in her, just knit me a hat while we're gone. - Sure, if I could figure out how to keep the wool on the needles. - The rabbit goes in the whole, around the tree and back out again. What can I say? I visit my grandmother during the summers. - At 30, right? Around the... the tree and... - There's cameras, so don't move. OK, let's go. Let's go! : Please report to patient room 7329e. - Let me see your wrist. Let's get rid of this bracelet. I don't get it. Evelyn broke the mirror and drew the videotape on the plywood backing. It's a two-way mirror. Alexandra, stand back. - The VCR and tape have to be in the vault room. Come on. The hidden room has to be in here somewhere. Try to find a door or something. Look for a keyhole. - Did you find something? - I don't know. Give me your flashlight. It's not working. - Try it again. - That's it. The vault. Oh my God. I was here with my aunt. There's already a tape in here. - So, you're sure? You know what this might be? - Yes, yes. There I am. There's my mother. What...? Sam... What? Wait! It stopped! - The tape's run out! - I need to know what happened that night! - Alex, we can figure it out. - I need to know now. - Come on. Come on. I still think this is too aggressive an environment. Especially after the tapes. - No. No, it's not. - Focus on the flame. Feel the glow surround you. And walk yourself through the flame. Breathe... Deeper... Deeper... Let yourself go. - ♪♪ And if that horse and cart fall down ♪ ♪ You'll still be the sweetest little girl in town ♪♪ You're her doctor! You took advantage of her! I want you to leave before I call the police! - No! I love her! - You're sick! I'm going to destroy you, Sam. - Give me the damn tape! - Go to hell! - I'm sorry. - You maniac! Get out! - Arrgh! - Mommy? Mommy? What's going on? : Evelyn! Where's the damn tape? - Mommy! - Happy New Year! - Help! Help! In here! - Mike? Mike? - Now you know. I... I loved your mother. And I killed your aunt so she couldn't destroy me. No more secrets between us, Alex. I manipulated you. And I drugged you. And I killed Dan. And it is all... your fault! None of this had to happen. But you... Just... You couldn't leave the past alone. Safe with the memories that I gave you. That I... created for you. Why couldn't you, Alex? Why couldn't you? - Don't... - Why couldn't you? - Ah! - It's nothing personal, sweetheart No, no, no. I just want my life back. Arrgh! This ends now. Argh! - Come on, old man! - Ah! - Ah! Look out, Mike! - Hold on! Wait up! Come on! I'm still recovering here! - Yeah? You keep telling yourself that when I beat you again tomorrow. - Uh-huh? - Come on. I'll make you some lunch. Grilled cheese? - Grilled cheese. Fantastic! Closed captions: Global Vision
