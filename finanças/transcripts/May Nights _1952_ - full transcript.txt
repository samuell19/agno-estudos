Zhukov Hush, girls, let's go! Grandpa! Grandpa, tell us a fairy tale of some kind. Oh, grandpa, well, tell us! - Ta-ta-ta. Ta-ta-ta. - Tell us... tell us.. - Tell us! - I don't know what to tell. What if nothing comes to mind. Yes, I'll tell you what happened one May night. It was an evening just like now. And just as noisily the young men and women gathered together. And poured out their joy in song. The sun is low evening is near. Come out to me my sweetheart! Come out to me my sweetheart! You promised to love me forever. Know no one but me. And for me it's living. And for me it's living. No. My bright-eyed beauty must be fast asleep. Galya! Galya! Are you sleeping or don't you want to come out to me? Are you afraid, lest someone sees us? Don't be afraid: there's no one here. But if anyone shows up, I'll cover you with my coat, wrap my belt around you and fold you in my arms and no one will see us. My heart, my fish, my necklace! Look out for a moment! No. You are not sleeping, proud maiden. You like to mock me. Goodbye! Levko! Galya! Levko. Galya. How impatient you are. Angry already? Why choose a time like this? The streets are full of people wandering around. - I'm afraid. - Do not be afraid, my red viburnum! I'll let no one harm you! You know how bitter it is not to see you for an hour. - Levko, do you know what I'm thinking? - What? It's as if... something is whispering in my ear. that henceforth we will not see each other so often. Maybe I bore you? No, you don't bore me! I love you, my black-browed Cossack! I love you for this... that you have brown eyes. And the way that they look at me. I feel my soul smiling inside. So merrily, and it makes me happy. Galya! Levko! Levko! Wait! Don't, Levko. Tell me first, have you spoken to your father? What? Yes, that I want to get married, and you to marry me. - I spoke. - And then? What can be done with him? The old man pretended to be deaf, as usual. To hear nothing. Look, Levko. Look! Levko! A long time ago when I was still small I was told something terrible about this house. Levko, do you know? Tell me. Let it be, my beauty. You never know what women will tell. - You will only disturb yourself. - Tell me. Tell me, Levko. Evidently people are telling the truth, that the devil sits with girls arousing their curiosity. Well, listen. A long time ago, my darling, in this house lived a Cossack. This Cossack lieutenant [sotnik] had a daughter, a fair maiden. As white as snow, her face just like yours. The sotnik's wife had long since died. So he the decided to marry again. The sotnik brought his young wife to her new home. The young wife was a good one. Rouged and white was she. Only so terribly did she look upon her stepdaughter that the latter cried out having seen her. Night has come. The sotnik and his young wife went to their bedchamber. And the fair young maiden locked herself in her room. How miserable she was. She looks: a terrible black cat creeps towards her. In fright, the young girl ran to the couch. The cat is behind her. The girl jumped onto the bench. And suddenly the cat jumped onto her throat to strangle her. On the wall hung her father's sabre. The girl grabbed it, and struck off the animal's paw. For two whole days the young wife did not leave her room. But on the third day, she came out with a bandaged hand. The poor girl guessed that her stepmother was a witch, and that she had cut off her hand. The sotnik ordered his daughter to carry water, sweep the hut, and not show up in the master's chambers. It was hard for the poor thing, yet there was nothing to do: She began to fulfil her father's will. On the fourth day the sotnik drove his daughter barefoot from the house, not even giving her a piece of bread for the road. Then she sobbed, did the girl. “Father, you have driven your own dear daughter to her grave. And the wicked witch has destroyed your sinful soul! And I, unhappy me, can no longer live in this world!" From this shore, the girl threw herself into the water, and from that moment was gone from this world. And the witch? The witch? The old women's story runs thus: all the drowned women, when the moon is bright, emerge in the garden to bask in its glow. And the sotnik's daughter led them all. One night seeing her stepmother near the pool, she attacked her and dragged her screaming into the water. But the witch outwitted them. Underwater she turned into one of the drowned women. Right here, my Galya, as the old people say. Galya, don't think about these old women's fairy tales. The current master wants to build a winery on that place and sent a distiller here on purpose. Galya! Galya, calm down. These are our lads returning with a song. Galya! Farewell, Levko! Farewell, Galya! Sleep well. Farewell, Levko! - Farewell, Hanna! - You're back? Oh! The whole gang's here! Let me go! Levko! Where have you been? We've been looking for you for ages! Levko! No, lads, no! What kind of revelry is this? Aren't you tired of raising hell? God knows what our reputation is already. Lie down, better sleep. Have you no shame saying that to me? After all, Levko... Levko is still a young puppy. If I ever meet him at your place, I'll pull his forelock out by the roots. I wish I knew... what kind of rogue boasts of tearing out my forelock? I know he told you a load of nonsense. Turned your head. But I'll make myself known to Levko! - Let him try. - Let me go! Son of a bitch, what are my fists! Dad? Oh yes, dad! What kind of mischief are you playing at? Charming! I wonder what it means, that you keep pretending to be deaf - when I talk to you about it? - Is that how you talk to your father? Farewell, Hanna! Farewell, beauty! Farewell, dear Hanna! Away with you, you damn wastrels! Follow your fathers to the gallows, damn kids! I'll give you Galya! Headman! Hey guys, come here! Here. I told you to go to sleep, but now I've changed my mind and am ready to walk with you all night long. - That's the thing! - Right! And most importantly, do you agree to annoy the Headman today? The Headman? Yes, the Headman. - Agreed. - Let's go! What's he thinking of? Not only does he push us around like servants, he also makes up to our girls! I don't think there's a pretty girl in the whole village the Headman wouldn't run after. Enough! We won't allow it! What are we, guys, lackeys? We'll show him, lads, that we are free Cossacks! Stop, brothers! - If the Headman, then the scribe! - Right. Let's not miss the scribe! And right on cue I've a glorious song in my head about the Headman. Now, lads, quickly change your clothes, no matter what and return here as soon as possible. Hop, hop, hop! That's no way for hopak dancing! It's not going too well, I see. What are the gossips saying? Well, eh! Eh! Hop, hop! By golly, that's not it. That's no way for hopak dancing! Lying down. By God, wrong! What a fool. A fine thing to see a young lad or an old boar dancing in the street at night to the laughter of children. And you, old woman, don't scold. Go back home. It's long past your bedtime. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I won't look at any Headman. Who does the Headman think he is, dousing people with cold water in the cold, with his nose in the air! Headman. I'm my own head! God strike me down! God strike me down, but I'm my own head. That's what, not that... Hey! Grandma, open up! What are you staring at? Look lively, I tell you, open up! It's time for a Cossack to sleep! Where are you, Kalenik? You are not at your own house! Shall we show you your hut? Show me, kind young ladies! Young ladies? Hear what a courteous Kalenik he is! He should be shown his hut for this. No. Let him dance first! Dance! Dance! Dance? Hop, hop! Oh you. Clever girls! And will you let yourselves be kissed? I'll kiss you all. Kiss you all. Kiss you all. But I am the Headman. - Are you the Headman? - Yeah. Then there's your house! - Where? - There. Oh you! Are you thinking of setting up your distillery soon? With God's help, then maybe we'll be distilling this Autumn. God bless, God bless. And I'm ready to wager my last rouble that come the feast of the Intercession, Your Honour will be weaving a route along the main road as crooked as a pretzel. God bless, God bless. Now, thank God, there aren't too many vodka-stills about. But in the old days... When I accompanied Her Majesty along the Pereyaslov road... even the late Bezborodko... And you, father-in-law, how long will you live like this without a wife? What on earth for? It would be another matter if there were good to be had from her. Not good enough? Not good enough? She's as old as the devil. And her mug's covered in wrinkles, just like an empty purse. So I'm home at last! You see how that sly Satan really stretched out the road! Hey, old woman, spread that coat out for me to lie on. Careful you don't knock over the jar of ground tobacco. Better leave it... You're probably drunk today. Don't touch it. I'll get it myself. I like that. Marching into someone else's house and making himself at home! Get him out of here, double quick. Leave him, kinsman! He's a useful chap. A few more like him about and our distillery will do a roaring trade. Get rid of him! No, you can't do that. If he hadn't sat down on the bench, then he could have been escorted out. But once he's sat down, it's quite impossible. You're asking for trouble! I swear it's true. You could understand it if I was drunk. But no... I'm not drunk. By God, not drunk! Why should I lie? I'm ready to swear to the Headman himself. What do I care about him? I hope he drops dead, the son of a dog! I spit on him! I hope he gets run over by a cart, the one-eyed devil. Let a pig inside a house and he puts his trotters on the table. Pouring water on people out in the frost. I hope you choke on those words! Stop, stop! God save you, kinsman! God save you in this world and the next from pronouncing such a curse. Why defend him, I hope he rots. Don't even think it, kinsman. You don't know what happened to my late mother-in-law? - Your mother-in-law? - Yes, my mother-in-law. In the evening, a little earlier maybe than now, they all sat down to supper: the late mother-in-law, the late father-in-law, the hired man and wife. And about five children. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a man what kind he is, God only knows. He asks to be allowed to eat. How can you refuse a hungry man? So it's agreed. Only the guest puts the dumplings away, like a cow eating hay. While everyone ate one by one, the guest ate the whole cauldron. “May you choke on these dumplings!” - mother-in-law thought. Suddenly the guest gasped for breath and keeled over. They rushed to him but he had pegged it. Choked himself. Serve him right, the greedy swine. So you'd think, but it didn't work out that way. From that time on, there was no peace. As soon as night fell out would come... his ghost. Sitting on top of the chimney, and a dumpling stuck in his teeth. A dumpling stuck in his teeth? A dumpling stuck in his teeth. Amazing, kinsman. I heard something similar even in the time of the late queen. Listen fellows, have you heard? Heads ain't what they used to be! Go on, go on Cossack! Go on, go on Cossack! The Headman's head, squint eyed bird Has sprung two horns for all to see Go on, go on, Cossack! Go on, go on, Cossack! Blacksmith take your hammer large Bind that head in iron hoops Blacksmith take your heavy bars Bash the head of that nincompoop Go on, go on, Cossack! Go on, go on, Cossack! Our Headman's just a one eyed clod Old as a devil, a half-wit fool! Go on, go on, Cossack! Go on, go on, Cossack! First-class song, kinsman! First-class? First-class. Only it's a pity that they mention the Headman in not so polite words. Ahh.. First-class! But, by God, I can't hear a thing. Karpo! By the forelock! By the forelock! Go on, go on, Cossack! Go on, go on, Cossack! Stop! You won't escape me. - Where are you going? - Let me go. You can't escape me! Karpo, open up the lumber-room! We'll lock him in a dark room! Where are you going? Hold on! That won't help! Squeal like the devil himself but you won't fool me! Now let's wake up the scribe, let's collect the tenths, let's catch all these brawlers. And today we'll issue a resolution to them all. I was coming to see you, pan scribe. At your service, pan Headman. Crazy things have begun, pan clerk. Wild things, pan Headman. - What is it? - The youngsters are running wild! They are outrageous. Your honour is described in such terms... I'd blush to repeat them. I was going to give them a piece of my mind, but they scampered off. Oh, you, you naughty gander! No, no, your honour. Their ringleader didn't escape us. He's cooling off in the lock-up where the convicts are kept. And how is he dressed, pan scribe? In a black sheepskin coat, turned inside-out, the swine, pan Head. - Aren't you lying, pan scribe? - No, no, pan Headman. What if this same rascal is now sitting in my lumber room? No, pan Headman. You yourself, not in anger, have uttered a small falsehood. Ah well? Give me a lamp! We'll have a look! We'll have a look. Let's see! Karpo! Open up! Excuse me for asking, but have you taken leave of your senses? Was there ever an ounce of brain in your squint-eyed head, when you pushed me into this dark room? Lucky I didn't bang my head on this iron hook. And then... didn't you hear me shouting that it was me? You grabbed me with your iron paws like some sort of bear and pushed me in! I hope the devil pushes you in his lumber-room like that! I hope you choke, you one-eyed fool! May a pot hit you on the head! So you slip on the ice, damn Antichrist! May the devil take you... What the hell? I heard my sister-in-law scream. Let's go to the convicts' lock-up. Headman... And I'm my own headman. I'll get to you too. Karpo! - This atrocity must be stopped! - It should, pan Headman. Let everyone know what power means. Let them know, pan Headman. Have they forgotten the Headman is appointed by the Tsar? - From the Tsar, pan Headman. - I haven't forgotten, how those damned rascals drove a herd of pigs into my vegetable garden, gobbling all my cabbages and cucumbers. I haven't forgotten how those damn kids refused to thresh my corn. I've not forgotten. Not forgotten a thing. But, the devil with them, I need to get my hands on the trickster in the black sheepskin coat. We must, we must, pan Headman. And yet this time it’s not pan Headman, but pan scribe whose caught the rascal in the black sheepskin coat. He's a nimble bird, that one. It wouldn't be a bad idea to have a chap like that working in the distillery. Better yet, hang him up, from the top of the oak. to light up the street. Karpo! Here. Pan, hold on. - Here! - Go on. Stop! Lord, it's Satan! Keep away from me! Fire! Hurry! Fire! It may be government property, but I don't care! Burn it down! No trace of their damn bones left! What are you saying, brothers! Your hair has long since turned white and you still haven't an ounce of wit. A simple fire won't burn a witch! Only fire from a pipe can burn werewolves. Wait, I'll take care of everything! It's me! Stop, brothers! Why vainly accumulate sin? Maybe it's not Satan after all. If it... whatever it is that's in there, agrees to make the sign of the cross, then that's a sure sign it's not the devil. Fine. Away from me, Satan! Stay away from me, Satan! If you don't move, we will open the door. Oh, I won't move. I won't move. Stay away from me! Cross yourself! What the hell? Exactly. It's sister-in-law! And what evil force dragged you, into this hut? Those damned lads grabbed me in the street. The devils pushed me through the window into this house and nailed up the shutters. And as for you, you one-eyed Satan! I know your scheme. You were glad of the opportunity to burn me! So you'd be free to go out with the girls? So there was no one to see how this old greybeard was fooling around? You think I don't know what you were cooing to Hanna tonight? Aha!! I know everything! It'll take more than the likes of you to pull the wool over my eyes. I've put up with a lot, but I'll make you sorry one day! Yes, now I see it's you. I am my own Headman. Hop! Kind people! Hey! - Who are you? Devils? - Devils! Devils! Come with us, Kalenik? Where? To hell? - To hell! - Let's go. No, there's no doubt Satan had his dirty paws in this. By God, it's true, pan Headman. There is no way without Satan. Here, I can still remember when the late queen bless her memory... Got him! Got him! - Got him! - Got who? The devil in the black sheepskin coat. Let me get at him! Good evening, sir. So this is hell? Oh, I'll give you hell. You are out of your mind! - It's the drunk Kalenik! - Yeah. Are you blind? What are you doing? - Who did you catch? - What in thunder! He was in our hands, pan headman! - In whose hands? - In ours. In the alley surrounded by those damned lads, they danced, bumped us, stuck out their tongues, tugged our hands. Hands... Whose hands? Ours. And how we caught that crow instead of him, God only knows. Knows, knows... Nobody knows anything! By my power and of all the people the command is given: that this criminal is apprehended forthwith, and the same punishment be handed out to all those found in the street and that they be brought to me for punishment. - Have mercy, pan headman! - If you had seen their ugly mugs. Not one us us from the day we were born has seen such vile snouts. - So you won't listen? - Pan Headman! - Are you in cahoots with them? - Pan Headman! Are you mutinying? What's this? Are you starting a riot! Pan Headman, have mercy! Now run, double quick! This very moment! You make damn sure. Yes, I was, back in the days of the late Queen-Empress... No... I'll fall asleep right here. Sing to me, young Cossack, some song or another. Oh, you moon my very own moon! And you, bright dawn! Cast your light upon yonder abode On yon fair maid, shine now My friend. My friend, find me my stepmother! She is a fearful witch. She gave me no peace in this world. She tormented me. Find her, my friend. I am ready to do anything for you, fair maiden! But how can I find her? Look. She is there. She dances a round dance with my girls and basks in the moonlight. But she is sly and cunning: she took on the appearance of a drowned woman. But I know, I can feel that she is there. Find her, my friend. Let's play Ravens. I don't want to be a raven. I feel sorry for taking the chicks away from their poor mother. She can't be the witch! I'll be the raven! The witch? That's the witch! Witch! Witch! Witch! How can I reward you, friend? I know, you need no gold. You love Hanna. But your stern father prevents you from marrying her. He won't interfere now. Take this note and give it to him. Was it really a dream? I saw everything so vividly, as if it were real. I'm betting it's human, and not the devil. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Grab him. Grab him! What are you afraid of? Grab him! Grab him! Right here. He's alone, and there are ten of us. Enough of your fool tricks! Levko? Son? It's you, you little cur! Look, the devil's spawn! I was wondering who the rascal was, what hell-born maggot was making all this mischief. And it turns out, it is you. May your father choke on a lump of porridge. It was you raising hell in the streets, making up those songs. So you'd like to have your hide tanned? Tie him up!! Wait, father! - I've been asked to give you this note. - By whose order? I've no time for notes now! No notes! - Tie him up! - Wait, wait. Pan Headman. It's in the commissar's hand. - The commissar? - The commissar. Read it. What does the Commissar say? Read. Let's hear what the commissar writes. Decree... Decree... Hea... Head... Yevtukh Makogonenko. Oho! He writes to me. It has reached us that you, you old fool, instead of, collecting past arrears and keeping order in the village, you've gone soft in the head and are making mischief. By God, I can't hear a thing! Decree to headman, Yevtukh Makogonenko. It has reached us that you, old fool,... Stop, stop! There's no need! Even though I didn't hear I know it has nothing to do with the matter in hand. Read on. ...old fool... And as a result, I order you to marry off now to marry off your son, Levko Makogonenko, to a Cossack woman from your own village, Hanna Petrychenkova. If, upon my arrival, I find my instructions have not been carried out, then I will hold you directly responsible. Commissar Retired Lieutenant Kozma Derkach-Drishpanovsky. There's a thing! Where did you get this note? I went away into town yesterday evening and met the Commissar there, who was getting out of his carriage. When he learned that I was from our village, he gave me this note. - I see. - And asked me to tell you, father, that he will call in on us on his return journey for dinner. - Did he say that? - He did. Do you hear? The Commissar himself will come to our brother, that is, to me, for dinner! As you say, kinsman, it's no mean honour, is it? It is, pan Headman. Pan scribe, what do you think? Would it be necessary for our eminent guest to issue an order, so that each household should contribute a chicken, a length of linen... And one thing more... - It would be necessary, pan Headman. - God willing. Well, today's incident reminded me of that time... And when is the wedding, father? Father! Wedding? I'll tell you what I'd like to do with your wedding! Well, yes, for our distinguished guest, though it's strange to me how this came to him, tomorrow the priest will marry you. Damn you! Let the Commissar see how well we discharge our duty. But first I'll give you a taste of the lash. Do you know the one hanging on the wall, near the corner? I will repeat it again tomorrow. So... today's incident reminded me of the time when I accompanied Her Majesty along the Pereyaslovskaya road. Well, now the Headman will tell how he carried the queen! Sleep, my beauty! Dream of everything that is best in the world. But even that will not be better than our awakening! Sleep my beauty sweetly sleep May all things sweet and lovely fill your dreams May all things sweet and lovely fill your dreams Do you think, do you dream about me? Day and night I think only of you. Day and night I think only of you. May the night time bring you sweetest sweetest dreams Fate, how happy it will be with a sweet friend Let us dream that we're together lead our lives as one Oh, my beauty here's to life with you. That is how it used to be, girls in the olden days. - Tell us more, grandpa. - Tell us more. No, that's enough for now. Until another evening, then I will tell you another scary tale. And now look, already the sun has gone down. It's time. The End Subtitles: corvusalbus & lemicnor
