Push that again. It's on. One more time. It's still a little choppy. Why? Let's go get the rest. We'll get it. You can relax. We're selling those, too. We have two of them. We have two. Take them for ten Somoni. Ten Somoni? How about one pan? What can I say? If you're buying one, have them both. This was our application for Australia. This is all the paperwork. This is one part. This too. It's a lot. This was our "Art Café." They'd pray outside. – Here they are. The idiots would pray for the café to close. This is the day it closed. There's so much. This is the mullah who started the boycott of the café... who protested it after Friday prayers. – I hope he rots in hell. You can tell by his face that he's more Taliban-ier than the Taliban. This is our film camera... A mobile phone. Does it look good? Cheers to all the accomplished women. Today we did get some good news. One of my wife's films was accepted into a festival somewhere in Turkey. So I'm really happy. Cheers to all the accomplished women in the world. Look at all these ants you're eating next to. There are lots of ants by you. I've swept this area a number of times. They're living beings. They have a right to breathe, to walk, to live. That's fine, but it's not right for you to sit by them eating bread. These ants are my friends. They're honest with me. What is it, sweetie? – Gum. Gum? Here you go. Let's go, Nargis. Thank you for everything, Rakhshon. – It was nothing. Bye, Nargis. Sorry for all the trouble. – It was nothing. Take care. Hopefully we'll make it there safely and see you again. Goodbye. Hey! Where'd you get that splinter? What is it? – Just a splinter. I thought that would be 1,000 Afghani for 100 Somoni. The value of Somoni has gone down. What a custom. It's really warm. What do I do with this? It's already warm with all these clothes. What am I going to do with this thing? Is this stuff also yours? – Yeah. We'll be there soon? No, we'll get there by night. We'll arrive in Mazar-i-Sharif tonight. Clap your hands... We had a television, you know. My parents would watch reports of the war in Afghanistan on it. Little by little I thought, "Our country is so destroyed." When my dad would realize that we were listening, all of a sudden he'd say, "Hey, Nargis and Zahra! "When you grow up, what do you want to be?" ...In regional operations, the Taliban has the upper hand over us. In war, whoever has more initiative will always attack... This year, the Taliban have increased the intensity of the war. The Ministry of Defense says the Taliban is not alone... The power really comes and goes. It's always like this. There were only a few houses here and there. This was a wide space where we used to play soccer. We'd play right there! – Yeah. It's a very sad sunset. We've come to our friend Ali Mardani's house. Then... Today... We heard the news that, on the same road we drove through Kunduz, the Taliban captured 50 more people. They took them, the travelers, out of their cars. And took them hostage. It's not clear if they've been killed. About a week ago, they also captured some people. Of those, one was set free. Another was killed. So for these 50 people, I don't know. His clothes look like the Taliban. I don't like it. When my dad was younger, he probably wore clothes like this and a thing around his head, and he looked like the Taliban. It's because of the war that they wear that? What honey? Daddy, if you tie that on your head, I'm gonna eat you. I was born into a very religious family. My father was a mullah. My grandfather was a mullah. My great-grandfather, and so on, they were all mullahs. And among six brothers, only I didn't become a mullah. What is this? It's a map of the world. Do you know where we were? Where we are now? I don't understand. You don't know? Let me show you. – Uncle Ali's house! I never learned. We were in Tajikistan. We were here. And then we came... to Afghanistan. And from here, we'll go, go, go to Iran. Where will we go from there? From there we'll go, move your finger... To Turkey. – Where will we go then? And from there we'll go... Where is it again? Greece. From Greece, we'll go to Germany. We'll go though some countries, I don't know their names. Greece's neighbors. Wherever we can go, that's where we're going. Goodbye! Don't forget this beautiful city because it's so pretty here. And this is Uncle Qazi. That's enough. Let's go. I have a friend named Hussain Hashemi Qureysh. I met him sometime around 1998 at a wedding in Iran. We quickly became close friends. I felt he had a great heart. One dark night, Hashemi was riding a bike and a car hit him. I nursed him. And we became like two brothers. Cut. I became a filmmaker. Cut. I opened Art Café with some friends. Cut. I made a film about a Taliban commander. Around that time, I heard that Hussain Hashemi was upset with the corrupt, broken government of Afghanistan. I heard that he had gone and joined the Taliban. I would tell him, "Don't work with the Taliban." But he wouldn't listen to me. I can't support what Hashemi has done, but I can't reject him either. Because I have seen his kindness. I have seen his generosity. But Hussain Hashemi and I were on two different paths. Cut. After my film airs, the Taliban kills the commander from my film. Cut. The police attack Art Café. Cut. We flee to the mountains. Cut. The phone call from Hashemi. "Hello?" – "Hello, Hashemi." He said, "I've got a Taliban bulletin. It's not safe for you here." I joked, "I don't have a problem. "I have someone on my side. I have Hussain Hashemi." He said, "There are people above me. Sometimes I don't have a choice." It was clear that he was serious. I understood that if we ended up face-to-face, I couldn't count on him. So it's better that we never end up face-to-face. Hussain Hashemi did me a big, big favor. Because if he hadn't warned me, I would've been taken captive. And Hashemi and I wouldn't have been able to look each other in the eye. And that would have been that. Today I heard that Hussain Hashemi was arrested in the mountains of Balkhab. And six months from today, Hussain Hashemi dies in Bagram Prison. I was feeling down, but now that we're in Iran, I feel great! You're not fasting, Nargis? No. – But everyone's fasting. Are you fasting? – Me? No. I'll fast another year. Let's go. What are they saying? Is the route closed? Hello? How many people do you have? Yeah. I'm telling you five people! And you're saying, "Don't call me!" Hassan. Do we have a traveler named Hassan here? Yes, yes. – Okay. Just one person? Four people. We're a family. Dad, look! That mountain looks like a painting. Dad, you wear this. Where are my glasses? Your glasses? You had them on. Check inside your pants pocket. I'm sure they're broken. They're okay! Sleep, sleep. Is the signal weak? What's wrong with it? I want to go down by the water. I love that the water comes up like this! It's like the water's angry! It waits up there, and then charges in. The water's cold! Whenever I take a shower, I'm gonna shower in water like that. It's getting my feet! Why'd you take your hair down? I'm gonna take it down and redo it. Nargis, take Zahra with you over there. There's a direct taxi. How much is it? That depends on which route you take. Each of the routes is different. Tell me the different routes and prices. And if we have to walk, where you will meet us. Then I can answer easily. We can take you by boat, which costs 4,000 euros. 4,000 gets us which route? It's a direct route. You board and it takes you straight there. Five times we were sent back from Bulgaria and once from Greece. We walked six hours in Turkey, and six hours on the other side. God knows I can't walk that long. After the water and those mountains, two cars are waiting. But be careful, there've been gunshots in the mountains. When we woke up, we heard the sound of a bird. It was that sound. We're moving! Go, go, go... Put this up so the police don't see us. It hurts there. – Where? Here? – Yes. It hurts here. It hurts. Gently, gently! That really hurts. We're hungry. Where are you going, Nargis? – We're going to the orchard. Watch out for this stuff. Sammy, take the pot. Be careful. You're going into someone's orchard? Yeah. We're gonna steal some plums. What are we supposed to do? They don't feed us. Dad, what's Nargis doing? Dad, isn't Nargis scared? They always lie to us. They say they'll bring food and they don't. What are you looking for? Get Nargis. In the house. Take the ladder down! It was a man and a woman. They came into the orchard. I got so scared, I'm trembling. I never trust people, but he always trusts people too soon! That short little dog of a smuggler! He can't pull that bullshit, the smuggler. To say he'll kidnap our girls. How dare he! It's wrong to even say something like that. I won't let anyone lay a finger on our girls. You paid them in Turkey. What's $2,000 to him? No one will kidnap a kid over that much money. Tell that guy what he said, and he'll approve the money you paid. We'll go turn ourselves into the police. We'll scream. Everyone will hear. He thinks he can say whatever he wants and get away with it. These men are vultures. After keeping us locked up here for one week, that man said, "If we don't have more money in five hours, "I'm going to take your daughters." All they want is money. They're not human. Yousef, who took our money, and all of them. Who does he think he is? He spoke in anger. – What's he doing? Saying he'll take the poor thing for $2,000? It's nothing. He's only one meter tall! No one said this was going to be easy. Getting to Europe is hard. No, but it would be good to have the number for the police just in case. There are people all around. He can't do it. This is your fault. What should we have done? The problem is we left our money with him to exchange. We shouldn't have given him money until we got to Germany. He wouldn't do that. Then we should have gone with someone else. He said, "Don't worry. I'll send the money from here." If the police get you, they'll take you to a detention center. He came with his dirty shoes on our bed to threaten us. Dear God, what do we do about these smugglers? We ask where he's taking us, but we don't know the place he names. He says, "I'm taking you to a different smuggler." We're scared he's going to take our daughters away. How do you say "help" in English? It's "help." "I'll take this daughter away." "I'll take the other one somewhere else." "I'll take your wife and imprison her." "I'll take you and beat you." "Give me money." "Give me money." "Give me money." Turn it off! Let the police see and get us. What difference does it make? We'll have to sleep next to the road tonight. We were too trusting. We gave all our money to Abbas Yusuf. Turn it off. What are we supposed to do with this? Throw it away. It's soft. It's nice. The bed has a roof. How did this get ripped? Did they give you a key? – Yeah, I got it. Dad, there's a slide down there! Can we put a nail in here? – No. It's plastic. Good. What are these boils on Zahra's face? Lots of mosquitoes bit her. This is not mosquitoes. She's not bit elsewhere. I don't understand it. I think we should wash these. Everything here's dirty. I cleaned here. They got dirty playing downstairs. Forty, a hundred people walk through here... Nargis, hello. Good morning. Where? Show me. Come show me. Hold it out. Honey, Nargis' arm wasn't like this. Yeah, it was. It was like this yesterday? – Yeah, for a few days. Let me see the side of your face. They've eaten Nargis so much. I'm bored. – What? What happened? – I'm bored! How come? You're exhausted? I don't understand. What do you mean you're bored? Go find your friend and play. So she's bored. Instead of making her feel bad or being upset... I told her to go find her dad. And you guys could do something. Or go find her friend and play together. What else can I say? They're sitting there playing. She can spend time with them. She's driving me crazy! Come on! Bring these, too. Bring these... Okay. Just one person? What did you put in? Potatoes? Yes, I pour a little water in and I wait for it to cook. Mahsa, how are you? I hope you're well. You grow prettier every day. Better looking every day. For real. Give my regards to your mother. What was that nonsense? Women like it when you compliment them. It doesn't matter. It's inappropriate. It's not right. Don't do it. Saying "I hope you're well" is okay. Not things like, "You get prettier every day." What's the difference if it makes them feel good? I don't want my husband to make other women feel good that way. What'd she come for? Who? She came for this. For a stove? – Yes, to borrow the stove. You're upset with me. Why are you taking it out on that? I'm not upset. I just don't like that. "For real!" I'm not one of those people, and I don't want you to be the type to compliment other women. Just because you have a problem. No, it's your problem. You think everyone else is bad too. No, I'm not bad. I'm not the one saying bad things. And don't film this conversation. And if I film this, what are you going to do? Because... If others see it, they'll think we're like this. You're supposed to be an artist. A filmmaker. How is it different? I may work with a thousand people in film. I may act with women in a film. That's fine. We've both acted and worked with a thousand people. I don't have a problem with that. But talking this way with someone else, I don't like it. I may be acting in a film, where I have to kiss a woman. What will you do? – How dare you kiss another woman. But seriously, I've acted in movies. I don't have a problem with it. I myself have acted in movies where I was someone else's wife. I dressed another man, and I don't do that in real life. I did it in a film. That's different. That's my point. Good Lord... You can't be a filmmaker with this mentality. I'll be a very successful filmmaker. It'll be hard with this mentality. – No, no. You think that people who do whatever they want are filmmakers? But people who have some judgment can't make films? What you said is wrong. It's because of this kind of talk that many Afghans call cinema corrupt. This is exactly their problem with it. Then the police catch the people... First we decide who's the police. Then who are the travelers. We just got to the forest. Forest, forest! Don't go in front. I'm the lookout. I'm the lookout. I really liked Bulgaria. There was a park where we would play. It was nice there, but ever since that man tried to punch me, I've hated Bulgaria. It was fall. It was autumn. We had gone out to buy a coat because it was getting cold. On our way back, we saw a group of migrants running, running. I said, "Mom, Dad, what's going on?" "It's nothing, it's nothing." Suddenly, we saw a Bulgarian gang coming towards us. Four or five of them surrounded us. One of the gang members, when he saw me and Zahra crying, he got agitated. He came closer, and went to punch me. But my dad threw his arms around my head, and his punch hit my dad. It was really bad. Get inside, my girl. We were walking, and a rock hit me. Son of a bitch! I'm sorry, folks. I'm sorry about our stupid citizens. Who hit you? Say what happened. Say it. – A Bulgarian hit him How come? – Because they see us as enemies. I'm sorry about this. What about an ambulance? Do you need one? Don't be scared. It's nothing. It's nothing. We've come to a place as bad as our own country. I hope they rot in hell. They're stupid. That's them right over there. Guys, come here! Stay over here! Brother, let me tell you something. If we worked together back home like we did tonight, we wouldn't have to come here. May we live long! Live long! Hello. – Hello. I heard that you or your family were some kind of victim of aggression. Wait, let me have a word with them. Is it true? Are you a victim of aggression? This woman is asking, "Is it true?" She wants to report on the victims. Hello. – Hello, how are you? I'm fine. Hello, I am Hassan Fazili. This is my daughter. Honey, come over here. This is my wife and my daughter. We went to a shop by Fantastico with some other migrants, and some men came and attacked and hit us. Something happened with them, yeah? – Of course, I was with them. They are ready to talk about this. – Of course. And we are going to tape it with the video camera. So please, I'll ask you one thing. Put down the telephone a little bit so we can see you. I'm a filmmaker. It's my work. – Oh, great. OK, and can we go somewhere... Honey... So? Bulgarians say they don't want us here. They hit us and chase us. And today, they came to protest. What should we do? I don't know. The police are here for security. And we don't know what's going to happen. The police are over there to see why they're making all that noise. Resign! Resign! Deport! No day in court! Don't! I don't like this anymore! I'm going to tell the gangs to come and take me away from here. I'm not going to go outside anymore! Attack! Attack! We are Attack! Turn it off. I want to go outside with it. What happened? The gangs. We fought with them. What? Where are you going? Guys, no more.... Why is that mafia coming here? We are a hundred guys. Fuck these gangs. Fuck the police! The police hit us. Their mother's cunts! The gangs wanted to kill migrants. The police came and defended them. The migrants went and explained to them. I was on my way back in, and I saw them with guns and knives. The police didn't defend you at all? – No, they refused to help. They said, "You're all ISIS. And you've come to our country." I wish you were recording over there when the police were hitting us with the electric shocks... They were giving us electric shocks, man. They want us out of the camp and the camp closed. It's not about hitting or killing you. They want to show the media, tonight the TV stations are coming... They want to show how bad foreigners are. Her other one is ripped too. The problem is, Nargis is a 35. Nothing we find is a 35. Every shoe is either too big or too small. How's that one? I want to get these. You like them? They fit her, honey? They fit me. Zahra, are these shoes good for Nargis? They're pretty? Really, do you like these? – A lot. They fit? – Yes. I'll get these. Good. Let's go. My feet were frozen last night. The tips of my toes are ice. I think there's a problem. Whatever I do, they don't get warm. Let's get your feet under the blanket. My feet are shivering. Put your hood up. Pull the blankets up. How many days have we been in the forest? Four days and four nights. Run, run! You can do it! Run! You can do it! Not with my ankle. Why's the camp full? What are they saying? There's no room. The camp's completely full. There's nowhere to sleep except the hallway. Forget about us. What about the kids? That's the point. Forget the kids. We've come from the doctor with a patient. We were in the forest for 20 days. We were there for five days. – 20 days! How are we going to lie down? Right here. Like this. Let's check if we fit. If not... – We'll fit. This is falling over. I'm sick of this life! Nargis, take it. It's so hot. Go give it to your mom. Fazili, give me the camera and I'll film you. What are you filming now anyway? What is this? My battery's dead. I just want to make a phone call to call them. So they can take care of the family. How many people and from where? From Afghanistan. One, two, three, four. We don't know which camp the police will give you but... The police will give you a paper and... On the paper is written the name of the camp where one should go. When you get the paper, you have 72 hours to go to that camp. Today, paper, no. Where? Where can we get papers? How you come here? Who told you to come here? – ...like this. No, not like this. Who told you to come here? Right here? Last night, your colleague told us. The same way you find this police, go find other police. All police, all country give papers. Not this. Don't wait here. No papers. Today, no papers. Go. This is a half-built building. We don't have anywhere to sleep tonight. So we're gonna sleep here. Hajji found it for us. Hajji, who'd you bring? – Hassan Fazili. No way! Welcome, welcome! Welcome to your five-star hotel. Hello. – Hello, my girls. Are you alright? We are here! Hello, hello. – Why did we come here? I'm glad you made it. A family is sleeping above and one below. Wow. I'm gonna get some stuff. Stay here. This is a better spot than the others. The pillows are new. We can finally relax. We finally got to the camp and they gave us a nice room. It's clean. – Thank God. Nargis, you don't want to pray? I don't know how. I'm bored. Can you see without your glasses? I see blurry. I can't see at this distance. I have to bring it this close to see. And even still, it's a little blurry. It's like my glasses are dirty. It's like that when I see. These are the names of the people waiting to go to Hungary. Everyone in our camp puts their name on the list. Then the names are sent to Hungary. And the people whose turn has come up are written here below. It's not clear when our name will come up. That's our first priority. Because of the agreements we made with our neighbors, regarding the flow of refugees across our borders. And what about health? Institute Batut released a study about possible health problems of people entering Serbia. How is that regulated? Zahra! What's this, my girl? It's a Christmas man. On Christmas, it started snowing, so we came outside to play. Are you going to hit your father? Don't hit the camera. Don't hit the camera. Nargis got me. Hit me again. One more time! One more time! Once isn't enough! Once we arrive at this first star, which is Shid Camp, a car will take us to here, okay? Then we walk to the second star, across this white line. Okay, that's the border. And the second star is Croatian soil. We can't go across these farms, or the police will see us. We have to follow the river. We'll have to rest during the day and move at night. We've been waiting here on the list for a year. Because of that, many friends say, "Take the smuggling route." A few days ago, an Afghan girl died on that route. She was about the same age as Zahra. Even if it takes longer, I'd rather wait for the legal route through Hungary. Let's not take the girls through these difficult forest routes again. It's better to wait for our turn to come. I want to tell you something important. When the prophet of Islam came, his message was equality and brotherhood. What would he say? There should be no inequality. There should be no ruler and no oppressed or slaves. All people are brothers... black, white, red or yellow. All are human beings and creations of God... What? Say it. Nothing. Fazili likes... everything. What do you mean "everything"? He likes Christianity, he likes Islam. We don't know, he's not Christian, nor Muslim, he's nothing. He doesn't pray. Fazili doesn't pray, but all the men in the camp came and asked for him to be their mullah. And he did. "Be our mullah." "Give a sermon." And your husband gave a sermon. Now, if he prays and professes his faith, then I'll say he's a Muslim. Do you yourself pray? – Yes. Do you really pray? – I learned to not pray from you. I'm shooting you with the sun setting behind. Taking a photo or filming? Which would you prefer? I'm happy I'm a filmmaker. I love cinema. But sometimes cinema is so dirty. They had changed our room. We were packing. The sun was setting. All of a sudden, Fatima said, "Where's Zahra?" We asked a few people, "Have you seen our Zahra?" "Have you seen Zahra?" No one had seen Zahra. I asked Fatima how long since we'd seen Zahra. She said almost an hour. When she said that, I got really worried. A week before this, some men in Germany had raped and murdered a girl. All those thoughts rushed into my head at once. We mobilized everyone in the camp. We looked over here, over there. We went room to room. She wasn't there. We became really worried. I went and looked in the trees. I looked in the bushes. I was upset with myself. Why was I looking in the bushes? For one moment, I thought to myself, "What a scene you're in!" "You're searching in the bushes." I thought, "This will be the best scene in the film." I said, "Maybe, maybe you should turn on your camera, "and look for Zahra with your camera on." It just popped into my head. I didn't focus on it. For one moment, for a second, I imagined seeing Zahra's body. And from the distance, Fatima is running. I have my camera in hand, and I'm filming that moment. I only imagined it for a moment. I hated myself so much. I hated cinema. And I couldn't do it. Zahra was found. These are like snow. It's like snow? – Yeah. That's in the trees. It's from the trees? – Yeah. Hi. Can you check names for Hungary, please? Barrack? Room? Barrack 17. Room 5. Fazili, Hassan. Four or five weeks, I hope. – One month? That'll be 2018. We came here in 2016. – Three years in Krnjaca. 2016, 2017, 2018. Thank you. You're a good man. Thank you. Within a week, you'll have learned... And you'll love it. – I'll never learn in a week. Brake, brake! It's okay, if it's just some clothes. – It's all my clothes. This also ripped. And I really liked this shirt. When Fazili and I were first married, a little of my hair was poking out from my headscarf, he bopped my head and I said, "What is it?" "Cover your hair!" That's back when Fazili believed women should cover their hair. That was before he was open-minded. – I was a mullah-in-training then. Ever since Fazili has been with me, he has become open-minded. Meaning you're responsible. So why haven't you become open-minded? I am open-minded, my dear. If you made me open-minded, why aren't you? Covering my hair doesn't mean I'm not open-minded. That's not a problem. What am I supposed to do? Should I cover my hair or not? I don't know, Nargis. It's up to your dad. Why is it up to her dad? Why can't she decide? She or her dad can decide, I don't know. If I say something, you can't get upset. What do you want to say? Since Mom brought it up, I won't cover my head, and it won't be anybody's business. Is that okay? – Whatever you want. She was afraid of what I'd say. How can we take these, Nargis? And this? Bring it. If you like it, bring it, honey. We're going to Hungary! Hungary! You go there. I'll go here. Huh? She went there. I'll go there. Excellent! Now write a "C". Write "C". Excellent. Now make the smaller one. I'm imagining Nargis and Zahra riding their bikes, we've arrived at our destination, we're all at a park, and we shoot the last scene of the film. And then, the film can end. I learned well! Don't film me! For us, these dreams have become a mirage. I'm gonna forget. I absolutely won't want to remember this in the future.
