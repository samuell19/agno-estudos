Come see this. A leak? Again. Shall we go to the movies? - Shall I fill it up? - Yeah. Thank you. My trip is going to be longer. - Is it? - Even over a month. - I can come meet you there. - No, you can't. Why? I've never been to New York. We'll go there on a real holiday. You know... At work, travelling with your wife isn't appreciated. Beaujolais? - Chilled, please. - Certainly. - You're okay? - Yeah, just anxious. I don't know. It's the first time I'll be in Paris by myself. Good evening. Can you collect my jacket from the dry-cleaner's? I'm so tired! Excuse me. - I think I haven't forgotten anything. - I'm sure you haven't. And you haven't forgotten anything. Tomorrow, dinner with Hélène and Jacques. On Tuesday, theatre with Anne and Gilles. And on Thursday? You're having dinner at your mum's. She'll be happy to see you. On Friday, Jérôme is coming for dinner. He'll also be happy to see you. - I like Jérôme. - Stop it. On Saturday, you're going to the Vincents' for the weekend. Then, that's it. - We're so organised. - We are. - You're happy I'm going away. - I'm not. Alain... - You hear that? - What? Noise upstairs again. That's not very loud, it's late. Sometimes it wakes me up in the middle of the night. - Hello. - Morning. There's no word for that, some words can't be translated. OK, but... How was your trip? Tell me. Good evening. - Good evening, ma'am. - Good evening. Hélène and Jacques aren't home, I'm afraid. They've taken their daughter to hospital. - Nothing serious, I hope. - Appendicitis. I see. The dinner party has been put off. Can you call them up? - I will, tomorrow. Thank you. - Good night. Fantastic. You're such a good driver! Did you see the car? You didn't? You're quite a good driver. Congratulations. Very cool. I'm sure you're well-behaved as well. Actually, I was just thinking... - Save it for tomorrow. - Yes, of course. - You can't be serious! - Am I bothering you? What the heck... - Are you insane? - Yes... It's a pretty building. I'd like to tell you a story. Do you know the story of Alphonse Allais? This guy is following... Do I make you laugh? So this man is following a lady down the street. Then, he goes: "Well, this is my street." She stops outside a building and he goes: "Well, it's my building." She takes the lift, he follows her and goes: "Well, it's my lift." Then she reaches her floor. She opens a door and he goes: "It's my door." She turns around, he recognises her and goes: "It's my wife." - Weird, huh? - Yes, but I'm not your wife. I know you're not my wife. - You don't like my story? - I do. - What? - Yes, I do. Alphonse Allais isn't bad, but I don't like the ending. - I see. - Listen, I'll tell you. When he sees the lady and goes "It's my wife", he says to her "I'm sorry", and goes away. - Funny, isn't it? - Very much so. - Am I amusing? - Yes. Do you think I'm amusing? Hang on, the light has gone out. I'll tell you a biblical story. "Let there be light, and there was light." I'm really tired, I'm going to bed. - I'm boring you. - You're not? If you don't go, I'll call my husband. You don't have one, perhaps? - Or he isn't in. - Good night. Is your husband in? Goodbye. Listen, I'll tell you something. Just a small glass of water. - Really, I'm thirsty. - I need to sleep, I'm tired. Go away. - Like a lonesome castaway. - I'm worn out. Bye. - You're tired? - Good night. I won't have any whisky, just a glass of water. In the kitchen, a glass of water and that's it. - Yes? - No. You heard that? - You mustn't touch her. - We have to call the police. - Carole! - We need to think. What has happened? Oh God! Lady, I'll come right down. Don't touch her. We can't leave her like that. Excuse me. The balcony? Carole... Carole... It's me, Nansoit. I'd like you to come now. There's been an accident. The girl has had a fall. No, I don't think so. A fall. Onto the balcony of the floor below. Good. OK, very soon. Thank you. Don't worry, lady. I don't think it's bad. I've spoken to the doctor, he's on his way. It's preferable not to call the police. It's best not to. Maybe you don't want to. Neither do I. - Could you get her a blanket? - Yes, of course. Thank you. - Forgive me, would you like one? - Yes, please. Do you know Mrs Renon well? - Who? - Marthe Renon. No, I don't know her. But... - I didn't get it. - Thanks. OK, let's go. Thank you, lady. Will we meet again? Will we meet again? - Goodbye. - Goodbye. No, I'm fine. I'm a bit ill. I have a headache, I'm a bit nervous. No, I'm not bored at all. Everything is fine. OK, Alain. Love you. Bye. - Le Figaro. - Here you are. - L'Aurore. - It's still here. L'Humanité. And France-Soir. I should be getting a letter... Perhaps the postal services are delayed. Mr Nansoit, you haven't collected your post. You didn't have a bad night, I hope? What about her? Who? Ah! Carole? She suffered a fracture. But what she really needs is mental rest. The body endures a fall better than the head, right? How long will your husband be away for? Are you going away for Christmas as well? To the mountains? I'll be cold, it might even snow... Yours truly... Is the lift out of service? No, it isn't. It's working. Excuse me, didn't you get a letter for Mr Nansoit by mistake? Yes, you're right. I'm sorry, I completely forgot to... I haven't got it on me. I forgot to bring it back, I'll get later. There's a foreign stamp in it for my husband. I see. I'll get it later today. I'm so sorry. - She's very beautiful. - This one coming in is beautiful. - Hello. - Hello. - This is Jacques. - Hello. It's not easy to reach you. I remembered your name vaguely, it's Renon. Then I looked you up in the book. - What's your given name? - Marthe. Jacques, Marthe. - Hello. - How do you do. What is it about, I didn't understand... I found a France-Soir of a month ago. It had this headline on the front page: "Carole Matton". I wonder if it's the same one. Excuse me, what do you do, in fact? - I'm a journalist at France-Soir. - Oh that's right. How do you know it's the same one? I don't find this very encouraging. Couldn't you get some information? That man is your neighbour, after all. - Me? - Yes, I don't know... I'm not asking you to investigate but if you could cleverly try to... I'm a foreigner, you know. I'm afraid of all these things. Then there will be names in the papers and all. I'm asking you to be discreet. You don't have to go see him and investigate. You can just snoop around a bit. No, I've never seen this woman. - Are you sure? - Yes, never seen her. - Positive? - I'm positive. I had everything to be happy, except the main thing. I went to Amsterdam and Marrakech... In India, I fell ill. My parents were very happy to get me back home, So... I hold you, you hold me By the goatee The first one who laughs Gets a wee slap OK, you've won. We have a lot to learn from children. Well, it's time to go. I have a very nice stamp for your father's collection. A stamp from Turkey. Excuse me. If you're that curious, why don't you come see me? You can question me directly instead of opening my letters and eavesdropping? Do you know the butterfly story? Some butterflies were curious about a flickering light at a window. The butterfly king asked who wanted to know what that light was. One of the butterflies flew away and came back. He described what he had seen. It was a candle burning. The butterfly king said he didn't know that light. A second butterfly flew away and came back. He said that flame burnt and showed his blackened wings. The butterfly king said he didn't know that light. So a third butterfly took off, thirsty for knowledge. And he didn't come back. His body sizzled and was entirely consumed by the flame. The butterfly king says: "He alone knows. But we shan't know what he knows." Our place is the cave of Ali Baba. We store everything people bring and forget to take away. It scares away artists and people of taste. Suits me fine. I hate artists, taste, art and all that nonsense. Look, you just need to go a bit further up to change your perspective. My music doesn't bother you? No. I sometimes play at night, but softly. - Isn't it too loud? - No. What do you play? I improvise. Sit down. Thank you. - Would you like some liquorice? - No, thanks. They're very good. So what do you want to know about me? - Nothing, it's you that... - No, no games with me. I know for a fact that you enjoy spying on me. It's only normal that you should want to know me. I mean, we want to get to know each other. We're so close to each other. Don't you find it weird, a society in which you don't know who your neighbour is? Why do we always approach relationships between neighbours as a police informant affair? How is the girl? Carole? Carole Matton? - Since you know her full name. - But... Be wary, though. The police are after her. She could cause us all a lot of trouble, and to you. But the thing is, Carole was brought to me too late. Where is she now? At a safe place. We're forced to be prudent. Our science isn't recognised. Can I see her? Yes, as soon as it's possible. Isn't she in danger, though? I see you don't believe me. I didn't push her out the window, you know. She did a folly. A rather dangerous experiment... you'll understand it later, perhaps. You feel very lonely in this city. It's a sad day today, with the rain. It's hard to get used to loneliness. You're not used to it. Not here. Do you feel you're a stranger in this city? A stranger to what? - Are you Spanish? - No. People are often strangers to themselves. Could I see that little device you've been using lately? I'm not criticising you. Thank you. You know, you said a while ago that I was tense. That's strange, everyone always tells me that I look so healthy, balanced and relaxed, but in fact, you're right, I'm very nervous. But I think it doesn't show, because... Everyone is on edge and tense at the moment. That's normal. Yes. It's a common model. A little technological wonder. But there are other ways to bring down walls. I see you like to visit antique shops. No, it's not me. A friend of my husband's set all that up, he's an architect. It's very comforting to be surrounded by little objects, isn't it? The images in our dreams are sometimes prettier. I intrigue you. But it's not I you need to know, but yourself. You're afraid of me because you're afraid of yourself. Uncross your fingers. Once your curiosity has worn off, you will understand what you want to know. It's a mess here, I've had no time to tidy up. Plus, the maid has gone. That's why it's a bit of a mess everywhere. Untie your hands. Come whenever you want. There's no point in spying on me. Sleep facing east. I wanted to tell you that... the other night... that's not like me, you know. I never cheat on my husband. Listen, I don't have an opinion on that. It's not my business. But I noticed you were surprised from the way you looked at me. Indeed. I thought you were a faithful woman, as they say. But faithfulness is a word that doesn't mean much, isn't it? No, I don't feel like it... It's like vertigo. All of sudden I want to let go. That's it. That's desire. Desire is often a kind of angst, perhaps. It's fear. Fear of what? We will get there. How about that? Now, you need trust. I do trust. Do you trust? You trust... You trust. Untie your hands. Very good. Get into your head that I'm not doing anything. I don't do anything. We shall talk about this again. This is pretty. One day, I will tell you the story of God and the demons. There are things from the East everywhere now. You don't know what they mean. But one day, I will tell you the story of God and the demons. Good night. Hello? - There's no one! - Is anyone there? Open it, it's us! There she is. - What's the matter with you? - Happy birthday! - Look! - It's your birthday! - It's your birthday! - She's in a cave. I'll put this somewhere. - It's not today. - Yes, of course it is. Here's a little gift. Thank you. I had no time to get something. Such terrible taste. - Gross! - It's horrible. - Ah, wonderful! - This is all I could find. It's not much, you see. The shop was closed. It was closed. Better than nothing. Don't spill it all... Don't break the bottles before opening them. - Here's the ham. - Ham! - You handle the ham. - You've save the party. - A corkscrew, Marthe. - A corkscrew. A corkscrew? Is there a corkscrew in this place? It's amazing, there's nothing in this place! What on earth is that? I think we're hearing noises again. These modern buildings. Nothing but rolling paper. Who asked for water? - I did. - I'll have some. - Why whipping? - I find that weird. Hey Rita... What's all this about? It's unbelievable. - A stain. - There's a stain on the ceiling. What are those stains on the ceiling? It's weird... Before thinking about answers, one must learn to ask questions. Question the way we breathe. Answers never satisfy me. I want all or nothing. All or nothing is the same. Learn to not want anything and you will get close to all. A child that questions things... "Why do I have two legs? Why do I feel hunger? Why do I feel pain? Why is there day? Why is there night?" That child is said to be "alert". A man with no questions doesn't know any more than a child, he is just asleep. Or worst, he's dead. But our society is afraid that men should awaken. When you're not happy with reality, people say you're moody, temperamental, escapist. They want to treat you. The Master calls it "to fall asleep". In good families, they choose a private clinic with a psychiatrist friend. They treated me like a mad woman, with all the torture techniques that go with it. The doctor was raving mad. He did so many things to me, the nurse decreased the doses because she was ashamed of obeying him. So I... That period is really very vague in my head. I send out an SOS to some friends. And when the press took an interest in me, my parents wanted to take me to Switzerland, so... I was kidnapped. By friends. And then... Their technique will not be able to kill childhood. Childhood will have the last word. Have trust. Karl Marx said: "It is no longer enough to understand the world. Now it must be changed." But can we improve something we don't understand? Who can brag about having worked out the universe? Who can brag about having worked out man? Don't you feel you're always on the edge of something? You remain unsatisfied. Unappeased. Don't you? You are tense, high-strung. You need to free your body first. You don't want to understand anything. Get out of here. Come on. - What have I done? - No hypocrisy! - I don't get it. - I know what you're thinking. That's all you think about. The obsession with sex. - Get out of here. - I don't get it. What did I say? Well... come back when you have sorted things out in your head. Go. Alain... No, no. It's nothing. Alain, I love you, you know. But... No, it's nothing. Yes. Yes, that's it. No... I'll write to you. I'll write about everything. I'll write to you. Bye. Hello. Come on in. The door was open, so I came in. The door here is always open, like churches. In the past. I'll introduce you to my friends. You can grab a bite. No, I don't want to disturb you. You'll find out people can't disturb me. Do you have something to tell me? It's really not important. I can come back some other time. No, it's very important to find someone you can talk to. Tell me. I wanted to say sorry for last time. Because I think I misunderstood you. No. - You are afraid. - Yes. That's true, I'm afraid. I'm afraid of talking to people I don't know. You know, back home, I had friends, so... Tell me. I don't know... Here, when I used to see someone on the street, for example, who smiled at me, I liked it at first. Now I know when someone smiles at you, they want to have sex with you. Yes. Over there, desire is stifled. Here, it is exacerbated. There is a third way. Come. This is Madame de Lanzman. Madame de Lanzman takes herself too seriously. It's her only weakness that I know of. I'll entrust you to her. I'll leave her under your care. I think our neighbour is ready to receive your enlightening, Madame. Take a seat, Marthe. Thank you. Have something. A cake. They're very good. - Would you? - No, thank you? I'll leave you now, I have work to do. Come with me. I've had an idea. Over there, desire is stifled... I'm told you don't take too well to loneliness. Have some tea with us. - You'll feel better. - Thank you. As it happens, we have some beginners who are here for their first class. - I haven't come for that, though. - You've no engagements? No. So... You'll work with us and you'll feel better. Why do you want to attend our teaching? Honestly, I don't know. But I know it's not out of curiosity. I'm sure as much. You're like all beginners. They don't know what they're looking for. They don't even know if they're looking for something. They learn avidly by heart everything they hear, like children. Then they get scared. They get scared because they've seen something that surprises them. So they're terribly afraid and they run away. What happens to them then? They go back to living how they used to. Perhaps a little more unhappily, because they can't forget what they've seen. What if you tame your fear? Then you realise the new reality isn't much scarier than the old one. Sometimes it is even rather reassuring. Because you see things clearly, you start to know yourself. You know your desires. - Is that the goal? - No. Those who stop along the way don't reach the goal. But those who make use of the light, who have taken it in to have power, to become a leader, don't reach the goal either. You will have to learn not to use the power we will give you. Only then will you have understood. Divest yourselves of your automatic reflexes. Connect with yourself several times a day. Go back home, get into your apartment. Suspend your movement. Think, "This is my hand. I am me." I really think I'm on the right lead. I question them a little, I feign interest in their method. And they believe me. I think we can find again... What exactly is their method? I don't know exactly. Some spiritual research. I haven't entirely understood what they do. We should find out where that girl is and what's happening to her. - There you go. - Are you telling us the truth? Why? Of course I am. Suspend your movement. Say to yourself: "I am me." Hello. Come in. You must be surprised to see me drop in on you like this, but I expected you at lunch the day before yesterday. I'm sorry, I forgot about it. I tried to reach you by phone unsuccessfully. The phone must be out of order then. So I decided all I could do was come to see you. - How are you? - I'm fine, thank you. - How is Alain? Any good news? - Yes. I got a lovely letter from him, he should be back soon. That's right, in two or three weeks. What's happening at your place? Are you moving out? No, I'm thinking of redecorating. It looks so different. All your beautiful books. Oh yes... I'll put them back. This is just temporary. I want to repaint, that's why. Your plant needs some water. Could we have a cup of tea? Sorry, of course. Forgive me. - You don't have a cleaner anymore? - No, she went away. - Shall I send you mine? - No, thank you. I'm fine. - So, tea... - Tea. Shall I get the milk? This always happens. Maybe some butter, if we have something to eat? Your butter doesn't smell good. Don't you have your meals here? I do, but... You should replace the butter. Dear Marthe, I hope everything will get sorted, and the place is clean when he comes back. Goodbye. I realise you can't live without Alain. Without my son! The sirens of the Apocalypse ring out on the first Thursday of each month, but no one hears them. If the people in this city weren't more degenerate than rats, they'd escape this city as one does a sinking ship. You can be one of those who will go to a safe place with us. Where are you going? You shall know in due time. To assess the day. To recapitulate. To know what you've done that was wrong, useless, mechanical. Calm yourself. Relax yourself. Breathe. Breathe. Better than that. You're fidgeting like a man who is thrown into water but can't swim. Trust the water. You will float if you trust the water. Even if you sink into it, you will see. As long as you control your breath, you will come back up. You will come back towards the air, towards the sun, towards the light. That's it. And now, you're floating. You will float in life as you float on water, as long as you trust the element supporting you. Do you think they are awake? No, they're sleeping. Machines repeating the usual movements. The more complicate the machine, the less likely you are to awaken. That's why modern society puts you to sleep deeply. Among billions of machines, how many of them stay awake today? I closed my eyes and I felt away. Make yourself at home. Put on that dress. Here we give up our old effects, the protection of routine and habits, of a convenient elegance. Wait till someone comes get you. It's a custom here to donate to the community that kind of object. No, it means a lot to me. It's a pearl from my mother. Here you donate what's most precious to you. It's true that you're here for sheer curiosity and we're only welcoming you to be cautious. Wait. Here you are. Thank you. My movement stopped instantly. I was present. - Am I on the path? - No! Wasn't the rule about... Wasn't the rule about suppressing desire? No! The rule is to do what you have to do. To eat when it's time to eat, to sleep when it's time to sleep. - Isn't that what I'm doing? - No. When you eat, you talk. And when you sleep, you dream. What are you doing there, you idiot? Come take a seat. Thank you. - Is it your first time at the school? - Yes. The first time is hard. But we'll help you. Pity you didn't arrive before supper. The Master spoke to us, it was beautiful. I think I'm not allowed to come yet. I'm not even sure I should have left my room. I see, you had to do to your cleansing. An evening meditating. I didn't have the courage to stay alone. No one told me that... No one tells you anything here. You have to feel. "You need to free yourself even from truth, because truth is also a prison. Any truth can be accepted and then rejected. Renunciation vivifies you and restores your youth..." What sort of rubbish are you telling her? They're but your own thoughts. Who told you to write them down? No one. Do I ask you to think my thoughts? Think your own thought, you utter cretin. I can see in the dark. - Why the candle then? - So that others don't walk into me. - Will you live with us? - I don't know yet. It only depends on your own desire. Do you want to let go? I don't know what they do here. We chose those who will be the worthiest of building Noah's Ark in the mountains. Don't listen to all that bullshit. Many of them are bonkers here. Some will go of their own will. And we will choose the others. What's important is that we live outside that society of bastards. Mind you, the boss is very good at finding old men and women who are loaded. We have to start somewhere. Zen is much harder to handle than a machine-gun, but it's easier to find. Bye. Don't listen to him. Those who talk don't know anything. Those who do know don't talk. Your body gives off good vibrations. Contradiction is life. Life is contradiction. Does the Master know everything that happens here? You should not rely on appearances. - Go in. - No. Yes, go on. Hang on, I'll open it for you. Since you insist. Go on, she's in shot. Oh yes. I wrote to my parents telling them to leave me alone. As I had to hide, Luc's friends took me to the Master. That's how I got to know the Teaching. What have you learnt? I wasn't myself before. I was only pretending I'd broken free. I hadn't truly broken free. Are you learning to be happy? First I learnt to be unhappy. Like someone who's weaned off drugs. Did you really take drugs? The drugs were words or desires of power. Habits that had been instilled in me. Then I had to destroy all that to rebuild and to learn to live the real life. And now you're really living? No, not yet. I'm learning. Why the fall? It's over, you know. I don't really remember why. Carole... Do you know why I'm here? - No. - I want to help you. I want to help you too. You ask yourself too many questions. I used to myself, and it was driving me completely mad. That's resignation, you know. No. The Master says it's assertion. Since this is the first group session to some of you, I'd like you all to introduce yourselves, to share your problems in a few words, and to say what you're feeling now, at the present moment. - Great difficulty, a great fear... - Of establishing contact? Yes and fear of missing out on something or failing them. After growing up, I realised the world was... bad. That's what's you felt before. I felt that. I try to take advantage since we can't change things. - We can change things. - We can, that's why I'm here. A father who... was relatively violent at first. But now he does what my mother tells him. To the point where I was often humiliated I was listened to, my opinion was accepted, then along came my mother and it was over. I was made fun of. Perhaps I didn't allow myself to live as I'd almost died twice. My sentiment about my childhood, I think... I wasn't alone. I always had many friends, but deep inside I was lonely. - Cut off from the world. - How about now? Now, what I feel is anger. - Marthe? - Fine. Everything was fine. - Everything was fine? - Yes. I had a wonderful father, very generous. - All his passion. My mother was sweet. - Passion for what? For everything. He was a farmer, he loved the land. He was marvellous. He still is marvellous, he hasn't died. - Was he loving? - Very loving. Not too loving, but very loving. - Your mother? - As well. I had a very sunny childhood, with lots of flowers. - That's very good. - Oh yes, very good. Do you have any friends? Male or female? Can you talk to them? Yes. - Do you have a best friend? - Yes, a girlfriend. - A girlfriend? - Yes. - With men, you're fine. - Yes, I am. I don't like talking very much. Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. - Listen to me. - Go ahead, Matthieu. Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. What do you feel? Nothing. I don't have the impression that I'm... I don't think you're feverish. No, I mean, connected. I'm suffering. I'm suffering. - I'm suffering. - Go ahead, Matthieu. I'm suffering. I was left... Go ahead, Matthieu. Love me. Love me. Love me. Love me. Love me. - Go on! - Love me. Love me! Love me, Mum! Love me, Mum! - It's not fair! - Go on! - It's not fair! - Go on! It's not fair! - It's not fair! - Go on! You're suffering too. You accompany him in this work. You can say, "Don't hurt children." Something like that. Don't shout, you're hurting me. Don't shout, you're hurting me! Don't shout, you're hurting me! - Don't shout, you're hurting me! - It's not fair. You're safe now. Learn to be angry. You can be angry now, nothing is threatening you now. Go on, Odile! It's not fair. It's not fair! Good! Scream! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! - Go on, Martine. - Scream! Don't hold that back. Scream! Go on, Martine. Stop! - Go on, Martine. - Stop! Scream, Martine. You can do it now. Let it all out. Get rid of that shit. Go on, Martine. Everything I say is good. Everything I say is good! Shit! Bastard! - Bastard! - Louder! I think it was too much for her. She really can't come in here. It proves she isn't that well after all. If you're happy in yourself, you can come here and see people who have problems. If you're really happy in yourself, you can accept that. If you don't, this means you're not well. Your entire façade crumbles down. Feelings are infectious, that's the principle of a group. Who did I say goodbye to? Was it you? I thought it was you. Marthe, let out what's in you. Chase away all those fears and everything that hurts you. Chase it all away, you'll find happiness. Once it comes out, it'll be out forever. Definitively. Eventually, nothing is left to chase away. That day, you are yourself. Why didn't you scream? I was too shocked. I found that awful, I couldn't stay. That's the point, you would have exploded. - That's dangerous. - It is, like dynamite. If the physician isn't good, there may be some suicides. But one day, everyone will have learnt to scream and cry in order to save themselves from their past and feel well. I am very pleased about our guests' demonstration. - Why don't we learn to laugh? - That's not necessary. Laughter bursts forth when you've screamed out your suffering and anger. Then, you can say laughing: "My mother is a whore, my father is an idiot, my brother is a bastard, but I am good. I am good. I am good!" Laugh. I feel very well. Well, I have lots of things to do. I won't waste my time on imbeciles. Not one single person here is telling me the truth. Do you think I am telling you the truth? The Master will do anything to make you afraid, more and more afraid. Some of these people have dropped everything: family, job... And in return, they're scrubbing toilets. They're all bonkers here. Do you love me? That's all you can do for me. Just as it's all I can do for you. - You can go away, you know. - No. I'm sorry, I'm at the end of my tether. The Master is not to blame that those who come to him are lost. We're looking for Carole Matton. Is she at your place? No, sir. - Who owns this property? - I do. We have a search warrant. Excuse me. I think you should first contact President Nipay, a great friend of our foundation. I know, but first of all we must find the Commissioner's daughter. Open it. There's too much carelessness under my roof. I cannot trust you. The teaching is now terminated. - You must all go back home. - But we have nothing left. Madame de Lanzman will handle that. Marthe! I'm sorry it took me so long. I knew you wouldn't wait for me till the end. What is it? You wanted to redecorate? You wanted to change the wallpaper because of the leak stains? No, I wanted to change everything. Listen, Alain... I have to explain something. And I have to show you. I have some gifts for you. - Now? - Yeah. Come. Won't you try them on? You don't like them? I took a hop over to Mexico, for only two hours, to buy them. That's nice. Look at this one. Come. I don't like it this way much, it looks a bit lame. What is it? There are pictures. I like it. This is nice. It's nice, a pretty picture. - No, as before. - I can't remember how it was before. Against the wall. - Like this? - Yes, that's better. While we're at it. The primula. It didn't resist my absence, it wilted. Oh dear... The cleaning lady hasn't come? You couldn't find another one? I want to move out. OK, why not? If we find something nice. You know, to find a balcony like this one... Fine. I like it, but we can change. Alain, are you doing this on purpose? What? Why don't you ask me for an explanation? I don't need to. You were discreet. You didn't spend much while I was away. That's good. I'm afraid of happiness. I have the feeling I'm betraying something, now that I'm happy. Betraying other people's unhappiness or myself... Betraying or forgetting, I don't know. Forgetting something important. Something I know when I'm unhappy, or maybe simply not happy. Something that makes me shiver. And that shivering is the truth of life. That's what life is. Life waking up inside us. Whereas happiness locks me up in an egg. If we're locked up together, that's fine with me. I don't mind it. I told you I was afraid to be alone. I went out to breathe some unhappy air, the air outside. I shivered in cold and fear. Like winter, when you get out of an overheated house. All of a sudden, your body comes awake in the cold. But I need this. I need things that are defined, a schedule... To not be overwhelmed by the unknown. Because you could lose everything. To find what? Listen, Alain. Do you think making love well is enough? That's too simple. I don't make love well? What if I needed something else, something deeper? What? I don't know, some sort of ecstasy. I see. Orgasm? "The orgasm"? Are you like American women? You think you're frigid? What have you been reading? A treaty on sexual enhancement? It's not about sex. It's about the body and the mind. There's also frigidity of the soul. What? Frigidity of the soul? You know, ecstasy and love with a capital L... That's young girls' stuff. Are you in love with someone else? No. So why are you bothering me like that? What if I had slept with a man while you were away? What if I had slept with a girl while I was away? - Did you? - Did you? You're horrible. - You're going to get run over! - Hey, you! What's wrong with her? - Marthe, what's going on? - I'll be right back. Take me to him, I've done something bad. Carole! What have you done this time? Come and help me. Open up. Police! Do you have a warrant or something? Don't worry, Mr Nansoit, we have what's required. Where is the girl? She is not in a state to see you. - No, leave her alone, please. - Come on. She needs a doctor. We'll take care of her. You will commit a legal murder. - Allow me. - OK. - I will never come with you. Never! - Calm down. Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me! Where is Carole? The police took her to hospital. - I was told that... - Yes, I'm leaving tomorrow. - I've been expelled from France. - That's disgusting! - I'm needed elsewhere. - There was no reason for that! There was, I don't have a home. I live at other people's places, I don't have an income. People say a lot of things. A strange foreigner, right? I, too, was afraid. I, too, suspected you. I didn't believe you. But now I know I will never leave you. Goodbye. No. I'm leaving you in a fix.
