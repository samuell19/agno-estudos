(slow soft orchestral music) (hooves clopping) (crickets chirping) (thunder rolls) (horse whinnies) (thunder rolls) (birds chirping) (cow moos) (knocking on door) - Good morning, sir. I represent Wells & Benton's Seeds & Shrubs of Cincinnati. Thought you might need something from our catalog. - You got russets and vandermen? - Oh, yes, sir. Cuttings, root balls, even fruit-bearing trees. Best prices in Ohio. - You give credit? - Yes, that might be arranged. - Step on in. (cow mooing) - So that'll be a half-dozen russet seedlings, and a dozen vandermen root balls. Is that right, Mr. Chilton? Sir? - Mm hm. (birds chirping) (slow soft music) (wood clamors) Here, miss, let me help. - Get outta here! (slow soft music) (cow moos) You can be on your way. Changed my mind, I don't want nothin'. (hand slaps) - [Woman] Ow! - What the hell you think you're doing? Sacheting around him, you get to work! You still here? - You got no business treatin' her like that, mister. I don't care if she's kin of yours or not. - I asked you civil once. You want me to get my gun? (slow soft music) (birds chirping) (carriage rattling) (hooves clopping) - Whoa, whoa. (cows mooing) (bell clanging) (knocking on door) - Uh, I left my order book here, somewhere in the kitchen. (door closes) You related? - No kin. Once he finds you here, he'll kill us both. - Oh, he don't scare me. You beholden to him? - I ain't no way beholden. (laughs) We don't have much time. You best say your piece. - My name is Thomas Linthorne. - Mine's Kate Harewell. - Couple of months ago I bought a small, abandoned farm a few days south of here. It cost me everything I got. I was doing this job just to get a little ahead before I moved down there, but if you're willing to work it with me, I guess I'm ready now. - You're asking me to go with you? - I'm asking you to marry. - You are? - I ain't lookin' for a work horse, don't take me wrong. - Don't you worry about me workin'. - I just know when I saw you I wanted you for my wife. - Come for me tonight. Sleeps so drunk, won't nothin' wake him. (thunder rumbling) Shh! - Heeyah, heeyah! Yah, heeyah! (slow dramatic music) (thunder rolling) (Kate laughing) (crickets chirping) Sleepy? - Not sleepy but I'm awful cold. - We're far enough away, I'll make a fire. (crickets chirping) (birds singing) - Who are you, Thomas Linthorne? - Well, my mama was a kitchenmaid down in Germantown for the Linthorne family. She died birthin' me. They let the cook raise me up till I started lookin' an awful lot like old man Linthorne. Mrs. Linthorne, she gave me $10 and told me I had to go. I joined up for Mr. Lincoln the day the fired on Sumpter. Been lookin' for a farm for myself since the day they mustered me up. You sure you wanna be a farmer's wife? - You won't be wondering what went on in that house of Rancey until it makes you crazy? Best all around if you know now. You don't wanna marry up after that, well, you're not beholden. - What happened? - Caught me in the swimmin' hole one day. Said he was goin' to town but he didn't go to town. Afterward, I opened up his skull with a rock. Hasn't come near me since. He knew if he did, I'd kill him in his sleep. Scarlet fever took away my whole family when I was nine. Rancey and his mother took me in. They weren't too bad, till Rancey's mother died. Don't make no difference. - Oh, you are the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life. (laughs) I never thought I could have a woman like you. - You can have me if you want me, Thomas. Don't think I'm gonna hit you with a rock. (slow soft music) (crickets chirping) - [Thomas] Morning. - [Woman] Good day. - Guess you wanted Lutheran, don't you, Kate? - They do say Lutherans tie awful tight. - Then they'll be Lutheran. I don't want any slipknots in this family. (speaks in foreign language) We wanna get married. How much does it cost? - You are Lutheran? - Is it cheaper for Lutherans? (speaks in foreign language) - He don't (speaks in foreign language) much English. 50 cent. - Okay, tell him to go ahead. (speaks in foreign language) - Ya, ya. - Ya. (speaks in foreign language) - Yes. (crickets chirping) (speaks in foreign language) - The ring forever means. (slow soft music) - You better kiss me, Thomas. (slow soft music) (lighthearted triumphant music) (people chattering) - Whoa. (horse whinnies) Here we are. (panting) I've been driving by this place the last five years, hopin' no one would see what I see till I had the money to buy it. And here I am, with my wife in my arms. It's a wonder, ain't it, Kate, how things work out? Now you gotta look past all this ruin, it ain't been worked in the last 10 years. Look at the swell to that land. It's like, it's like a woman's breast. (laughs) - (laughs) I guess you can say that to your own wife, so long as it's her breast it puts you in mind of. - (laughs) It does at that. Come on! That's all black loam risin' up to the hills, waitin' to be put to the plow. We work like slaves, we'll have the ground broken, crop of corn in the first year. You know what a man can accomplish in this country with a little piece of good land and hard work? I watched old man Linthorne do it. (Thomas sighs) See that rise up there? They call it Church Hill. I don't know who owns it, but one day I will. We will. We'll call it Linthorne Hill. (crickets chirping) (doves cooing) (Kate screaming and laughing) What do you think, Mrs. Linthorne? (Kate sighs) - (sighs) It's gonna be a beautiful home, Thomas. And with God's grace, we're gonna fill it with children. (slow soft music) (people chattering) (laughs) Thomas, I can't. - Okay. (slow soft music) Don't know if you should be makin' this trip to town anymore, Kate. - [Kate] Don't you worry, he's tougher than that, Thomas. Takes after his papa. - You sure it's a boy? - [Kate] Has to be the way he kicks. - God knows I could use him. (slow soft music) - [Kate] Looks like Mr. Vitt. - [Thomas] You know him? - He's in church every Sunday, like everyone around here, except you. - Oh now don't start, Kate. - You're the one who talks about being respectable. Folks don't know what to make of you? - Well what business is it of anyone else if a man has doubts about things? - Hello, Mr. Vitt. - Howdy, ma'am. - [Kate] Thank you. - Well, this old place is sure lookin' up. I'm Spence Vitt, got a place on Goose Ridge, quarter mile up the road. We share a fence on your back line. - How do you do, Mr. Vitt? Thomas Linthorne. - Yes, sir. Well I hope I'm not intrudin' here. - I'll go ahead and make some tea. - I been meaning to come over and visit you, I got some things in my wagon you might use. Some harrows. The drag, planter, odds & ends. - You certain you can spare all this? - I'm settin' my land to fruit, don't need it no more. - Fruit? Folks grow corn and wheat around here. - I planted wheat and corn all my life, my folks before me, I'm bored to death of it. (Thomas laughs) - [Thomas] Well, I'm grateful to you for your kindness, Mr. Vitt. - I'll help you unload here. You know, I been watchin' whatcha been doin' here. You're doing a damn fine job. That's Celia Sipooni. She and Bill are your neighbors across the creek. - Bit odd lookin'. - Folks say they eat rats. I don't know for certain. I've only seen 'em at table once or twice, but I'm sure what they was eatin' wasn't squirrel. (birds chirping) - Guess you're sorta wonderin' what in ever I come over here for. - Sakes alive, no. I been meaning to get out visitin' our neighbors, but there's always so much to do and with the baby comin', I just keep puttin' off and putting it off. You must think we're downright unsociable. - Oh, I seen you cross the crick, workin' just as hard as your man. Told my Bill I best not wait for an invite. Well, especially since I seen Spence Vitt was here. He's a strange one, he is. Livin' by himself and never marryin'. Got the devil for company if you ask me. Thought I better warn you 'fore it's too late. - About Mr. Vitt? - Spence? No, your baby. You don't want that precious young one of yours to come out marked now, do ya? - Marked? - Down Sugar Grove Way there's this big woman there named Schoonover, had a brat most every year. Trouble was the goin' after the plow all day long, she looked too much at the horse's tail. You know what happened? Every one of that woman's kids was born with a hairy lip. (Kate laughing) - I heard of things like that. - You got to be awful careful. You don't never look at nothin' bad, not even the least little bit. That's pretty, that picture of them roses over there by the stove. You stand and look at that a couple hours each day. (door rattling) What's that? When your time comes, you stick your head out the window and holler. I'll be there, at your side, to bring your baby into this sorry old world. - Spence tells me she run around all last winter in a coat made out of rat skins. And her husband, he's worse. He's the one who caught the rats. - That's awful to say. - Oh, I'm sparin' you what's awful. (lighthearted music) Mr. Holmes, trade you a pig for a baby bed? - [Mr. Holmes] You got yourself a deal, Thomas. (lighthearted music) (people chattering) (crickets chirping) - [Thomas] Whoa! (horse whinnies) - [Spence] That's Goram Schrader, he got a place the other side of Church Hill. - Church Hill? Belongs to him? - Well, he acts like it does but it don't. Bank's owned it for 20 years, ever since old man Chenowith died. - He wants it so bad, why don't he buy it? - Well, so far he ain't had no reason to. - Well, I'm not lookin' for a fight. But to my way of thinkin', a man pays for something, it belongs to him; he don't pay for it, it don't. - Well, best if you just go your own way and let Goram go his. Same as if you had a grizzly bear cross your path. (birds chirping) (wind blowing) - Mr. Linthorne. Well, you best get on up to your wife in there, Mr. Linthorne. (men laughing) - Don't waste no time on me, get up there! (slow soft music) - Come meet your son, Thomas. - Oh. (Thomas breathing heavily) (laughs) Come on, you won't break him. (slow soft music) (Kate chuckles) (baby cooing) Can we name him Hocking, Thomas? I always hoped to remember my father. - More than I can say for my old man. (laughs) Hocking Linthorne it is. (slow soft music) Oh. (Kate sighs) You see that, boy? You were born with land. Just like a lord. (Thomas grunting) (birds cawing) Oh. - Don't know what you have against it. - I don't have anything against it, Kate. I wish I understood it is all. Don't seem likely to me that God's up there watchin' to see that Hocking gets a little water on his head. (baby cooing) - Weren't you baptized? - I guess. But it ain't help me see any proof of all that's claimed. - I prayed, Thomas. I prayed and I prayed. God sent you to me and that's proof enough for me. - All I know is I got lost off the main road, rode up to Rancey's house to try my luck. What happened happened because we wanted it to happen. - What do you believe in, Thomas? - Well, when it comes to God, (sighs) seems like I don't understand any better than a rabbit down a hole. (slow soft music) - I don't believe you mean that, Thomas. - (sighs) I don't know what I believe. I don't understand how anyone does. I believe in myself. (slow soft music) I know that. (baby grunts) (Kate sighs) (wind blowing) (dog whimpering) - [Kate] Poor thing. - Oh, he looks like he's been whipped. - Just needs a little carin' for. - [Thomas] He belongs to someone, Kate. - Well, whoever he belongs to has no right to him. I wanna keep him. - Well, I guess we should clean his wounds for starters. Here boy, easy. That's it. Good boy. (dog whimpering) (wind howling) - I baptize thee, Hocking Thomas Linthorne. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. - Reverend, I appreciate it. - You're more than welcome, sir. (people chattering) - Well, Linthorne. Got yourself a brat, do we? (laughs) - Got myself a son, Mr. Tannersham. - Better hope you can pay his keep outta that little place of yours. - I'm hoping to pay his keep, and a few more besides. Good day to you, Mr. Tannersham. (people chattering) (baby cooing) - Don't mind Luke. He's just accustomed to being the richest man in the valley. - So what call's he got insultin' me on the day of my boy's baptism? - He knows you gonna be richer. (Thomas chuckles) - Come on, come to mom. Here you go. Come on. (leaves rustling) (birds cawing) (dog barking) (gun fires) (gun fires) - What you doin' with my coon? - Should've known it was you who would treat a dog like that. He come to us, ain't yours no more. - Worthless son of a bitch can tree worth a damn. (dog barking) He's all yourn. You can have the rabbit, too. - I was told this ain't your land. Wouldn't be here if it was. (birds cawing) - Now you listen to me, you dog-stealin' son of a bitch. I been huntin' this hill since I was old enough to hold a gun. My daddy hunted it before me. My granddaddy was the first white man in this valley. I'm gonna go right on huntin' this hill and no Johnny-come-lately better get notion otherwise. (slow dramatic music) (birds chirping) - We better hurry, Thomas. I don't wanna keep the children out in this cold much longer. - [Thomas] Just about done. - I'm worried about old Lonzo Brewster. He ain't even comin' to church anymore. He won't make it through a bad winter all by himself. - He hadn't been the same since his boy Jim ran off. Yeah, Lonz is a little touched to the head now. He wouldn't know if he was starved or not. - I'll carry some vittles over to him. - He won't take 'em, he's too proud. Why don't I have a Christmas shoot? We'll put a heifer up for a prize. Lon's still a crack shot. The rest of us could have a little twitch that day. - We've had a good year. Let me put up the heifer. (slow soft music) - [Men] Whoa! - [Man] At the target, Ben. (gun fires) - Lean miss. - Lonzo, your turn now. (men laughing) - [Man] All right now, Lonzo. Come on. Steady eye, Lonzo, steady eye. Come on now. (slow soft music) (gun fires) (men cheering) - Woo! (men chattering) Looks like Lon's the winner! (men cheering) - Yahoo! (laughs) See this? That's my pappy's old gun. - [Man] That there's a fine gun. - Yahoo, ahoo, ahoo! (laughs) (men chattering) (cow moos) I guess I won me that heifer. (laughs) - One more to shoot. (cow moos) (coin clinks) (gun cocks) (gun fires) - Bullseye. - Guess that wins it, don't it? (slow soft music) - [Man] I knew that, just walkin' in here like that. (men chattering) (slow somber music) (cow moos) (horse whinnies) - [Man] It's just not right. - Anybody tell you why we had this shoot? This heifer was meant for Lonzo. - Man wants to be a fool with his stock, that's his business, don't mean I have to. - Seems you got a habit of layin' claim to what ain't yours. - I won this heifer fair and square. Any man here wanna say I didn't? - Oh, you won it. There was nothin' square about it. Or neighborly. - Won it all the same. (slow somber music) (cow moos) - I thought for sure he was gonna crack you in two, Linthorne. You don't know how lucky you were. - Seems to me Goram Schrader's the one that backed off. I never thought I'd see that day. - [Hocking] Giddyup, come on. Come on, giddyup horsey. Yaw, yaw. - I'll be damned. I think he's plowin'. - He's gonna be a farmer, just like his papa. He adores you, Thomas. - [Hocking] Giddyup horsey. - What are you thinkin' on? - Oh, I always had this idea of raisin' up a son who'd go farther in the world, an educated man. Guess I've got to make a farmer of him. - You don't sound like that pleases you. - Oh, it pleases me, Kate. Of course it pleases me. - Yaw, yaw! (slow soft music) - The Linthornes always had a big Christmas. The clan would gather from all over. I'd watch from the kitchen when they opened the presents. Never got a present myself, as I recall. - (laughs) Can't recall I did either. (slow soft music) - Means everything to me, Kate. Our havin' a Christmas of our own. (slow soft music) - (laughs) What's that you got in your hand, Thomas? - Something you should've had, long before now. (slow soft music) - Thomas. (sighs) It's beautiful. - Look inside there. Got something written. - "The ring forever means." (laughs) - I could have it taken out if you think it's foolish. - You've done foolish things before, Thomas. But not this. (slow soft music) - [Man] Lordy it's nippy out. - Morning, Mister- - Morning, ma'am. (people chattering) (horse whinnies) - [Man] Whoa, come on, hey, hey, hey, here we go. Here we go, here we go, that's it. That's it, run up in there, that's it, that's it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - [Man] Can you give me a hand later on? I gotta... (slow soft music) (horse whinnies) - Bryan Briarly, sir, at your service. Dealer in fine horses and livery. You look like the kind of feller that wants to go somewheres. (laughs) Wants to get there in a hurry. Am I right? Thought so. This is Black Belle. By Thunderbolt out of Jenny Beam. Spittin' image of her daddy. You've heard of Thunderbolt, haven't you? Fastest horse ever raised up in West Ohio. (laughs) Oh, yes. This right here is the best filly I ever had on offer. She'll be gone by sundown, you can count on that. - $350 and Winnie thrown in? (sighs) What've you done, Thomas? - We'll make the money on her when we put her to pasture and breed her. - Is it that important to ride the best horse in the valley? - I have been workin' like a beast of burden every day since I brought you on to this land. I don't regret a day of it. But there's gotta be somethin', somethin' I can have just for myself for all this workin', without accountin' to anyone. Not even you. - I guess I should be grateful she's a horse. - I don't take your meaning. (lighthearted music) - Enjoy her, Thomas. - [Thomas] Heeyah! (light triumphant music) Heeyah. Come on, girl. - Will you look at that? Flauntin' that new horse of his. And on the Lord's day to boot. - Well, you'll put a word for him in your prayers, wont' you, Luke? - I pray for Thomas Linthorne every day. - Come along, Hocking. (horse whinnies) Did you have to ride by the church? - I didn't think about it. - No, of course you didn't. When have you ever givin' a think to what anybody thought? - What is it, Kate? - You say you want people to respect you. You have to act respectably. People look up to you around here, Thomas. - Well, they look up to us. (horse whinnies) You keep the best lookin' farm in the valley. Do me proud. - (sighs) Well I work at it. And you have to, too. You have to think about the example you set. (birds chirping) (horse whinnies) - [Thomas] Hm. (lighthearted music) - Thomas, what are you doin'? - Settin' an example. - What can you be thinkin'? It's in the middle of the day. - We're old, married folks, Kate. That's respectable, isn't it? - Thomas, I have to get back to the- Thomas, I have to get back to the, (laughs) stop it. Don't. (laughs) - I ain't figurin' on makin' this a day's work, Kate. (Kate laughing) (lighthearted music) Here you go, son. - Stop it. (sighs) I ordered a Bible from the catalog. A beautiful one. Real leather cover with 14 karat gold filagree. Made with finest cloth rag paper from the Bible Society of Boston. - What'd you want it for? - This family is gonna have a family Bible, with our children's names written in it, and their children's names, and their children's names. And we're gonna read to them from the Word of God. And I want us to have a prayer at the table from now on. This family's not gonna live like a bunch of heathens. - Prayin' ain't gonna plow any corn. This man could pray himself blue in the face and still starve if he didn't work. - (sighs) Oh, Thomas. - It's a sad day when a man can't be a heathen in his own house. Just can't believe God's got nothin' more important to do than watch to see if I've said something over my dinner. - Well, the way I see it, Thomas, there's two things you can't deny, nature and your own heart. And you can't deny there's something in our hearts that tell us the difference between good and evil, tells us to do what's right. The way I see it, that's the little bit of God in our nature. Anyway, that's what I figure. - Whoa. (horse whinnies) Well, (sighs) you think I oughta give in? I don't want Kate thinkin' she's runnin' this family. - (laughs) Well, Thomas, we can talk about God but don't ask me about marriage. You got the wrong fella here. - Give me your hand, Hock. Gonna give thanks. - Thanks for what? - For what we got. The eyes of all wait upon thee, oh Lord. Thou givest them their meat in due season. Thou openest thine hand and, and satisfy us the desire of all things. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. (Kate chuckles) - What's so funny? - (laughs) You are. Thank you. - You laugh at me? - Never at you, Thomas. Always with you. (slow soft music) Thomas. Again? (puffs air) - That's not a sin, is it? - I don't know. (sighs) It sure feels like one. (slow soft music) ♪ All things wise and wonderful ♪ ♪ The Lord God made them all ♪ (dog barks) Springer! (dog barking) (slow soft music) - That old dog of mine been comin' over the hill and killin' my sheep, missus. - We'll keep him tied and we'll pay for the sheep. (dog growling) Don't you shoot that dog! (dog barking) (slow dramatic music) - You tell your husband a fair warnin'. I'll kill anything comes over my hill. Anything. (slow dramatic music) - Hocking! (dog barking) - Hey! (Hocking grunts) Got more guts than his old man, doesn't he? (laughs) (slow dramatic music) - (sighs) You shouldn't have done that, Hock. - Why not? - Don't you tell your daddy that Goram hit you. - Why? - Because he'd wanna go and fight Goram, and I don't want him to ever fight Goram. Promise me, Hock. - Yes, mama. - Good boy. (door closes) Goram Schrader was here today. - Here? What'd he want? - Says Springer's been killin' his sheep. - He's a liar. Spence told me his sheep died from waterin' downstream at his lime pit. - Is it worth it, Thomas? You have to own that hill so bad you have to go feudin' with the likes of Goram Schrader? - Put some distance between us and him. He don't keep to it, I'm gonna have him lawed for tresspassin'. - Thomas! (door closes) (sighs) (people chattering) (slow dramatic music) - [Man] Henry. - Come in, come here. (birds chirping) There's 3.000, and thought they were gettin' the best of it. Hell, if a man can't cut $3000 worth of good pine lumber in those deep ravines up there, it's only because he's too lazy to do it. - Some people say he has squatter's rights on his side. His family been huntin' up there for three generations. - That hill belongs to our family now. That's you and me, Kate. From this day forth, that's Linthorne Hill. It's just like I promised you, the day we set foot on this land. (birds chirping) (dog panting) (gun fires) (Goram laughs) Appreciate you takin' the time on a Sunday, Burt. - Well, if you didn't ride her so hard, I wouldn't have to shoe her so often. (metal clanging) (Thomas sighs) - I wanna go home. - You stop it, Hock. Get your rig outta my way, Schrader, I got work to do. - I seen a little of your work up on Church Hill. Right pretty signs you got nailed onto them trees. - It's Linthorne Hill now. And those signs mean what they say. - Trouble with fellas like you is they think they can buy everybody else clear off the whole damn earth. Never ready to let good enough alone. As you get a little money ahead, gotta try and take the bread outta somebody's mouth so you can go around braggin'! You do about this black mare you paid Briarly two prices for. - My business what I paid, none of yours. - I'm makin' it my business! I had Briarly talked into lettin' me have her for a couple a hundred before you butted in. - No law against out-biddin' you, is there? - You keep buttin' your head around, come the day you'll knock your brains out. Or somebody knocks 'em out for you. - You gonna move your rig? (Goram spits) Heeyah! - [Hocking] Papa, papa! (horses whinny) (intense dramatic music) - Whoa. Easy. Easy. You never show you're afraid, even if you are. You hear me? Never. You're a Linthorne. - Yes, papa. (Kate wailing and moaning) - Baby don't wanna come, Mr. Linthorne. Even after I rub camphor oil on her belly, and that always makes the baby come. Shh! (Kate groaning) - Kate. Should I get the doctor? - Go. Yes. Yes! Go! (intense dramatic music) - That's my Belle. Go, girl. That's my Belle. (intense dramatic music) (knocking on door) - Linthorne? On its way, is it? - Something's not right, doc, you got to hurry. - Let me get my coat and bag. (intense dramatic music) Linthorne, you'll kill us drivin' like this! - Don't you worry about my driving. Come on, girl! - Hold her in for god sakes. Linthorne! - She'll be fine! She's done it a hundred times. Come on, Belle! You just hang on. (intense dramatic music) (horse whinnies) (men scream) (Thomas groaning) (crickets chirping) - Someone we loved and admired has been taken from us, and it tests our faith. There are those who seek to cast blame and find fault, but there is no fault. Those who surrender to the impulse to lash out in temporal judgment will be disappointed. For no healing lies that way. No justice and no relief. We must seek our strength and our solace in prayer. Our Lord and Savior will answer our prayers and comfort our grief. For his strength and his mercy and his love are boundless. (slow somber music) (fire crackling) - Come back to us, Thomas. The children need you, I need you. We love you. - Trouble with believin' in nothin' but yourself is you got no one but yourself to blame. He had a whole lifetime of helpin' folks ahead of him. Why wasn't it me and not him? (slow somber music) (fire crackling) - (sighs) What's the good of this broodin', Thomas? (crickets chirping) (slow somber music) - [Spence] Bubba? - I'm in here. - Get dressed, there's something I wanna show you. I always thought there was something kinda funny about Belle stumblin' like that. Belle wasn't a stumblin' horse. I always remember how she picked her feet way up in the air. Look at this, what do you think? (crickets chirping) - Goram Schrader. - Yup. You prove Goram did this, you have him on murder. But it'd be kinda hard to do that now. - You tell anyone else? - No. I didn't think I was gonna tell you either. I was afraid you might do something foolish. (crickets chirping) - Why did you? - I seen what you been doin' to yourself. And I decided you got a right to know the truth. (slow somber music) Are you gonna do something foolish? (slow somber music) - If you wait a minute while I wash up I'd, I'd like to sit down at dinner with you. (baby fusses) (water splashing) (slow somber music) - We've missed you, Thomas. Haven't we, children? - I missed you, papa. - I missed you more. - Did not. - Well, look at you. Aren't you just about the most beautiful thing? (laughs) Hello. - The good Lord has given us reason to be grateful on this joyous day. He has answered our prayers. It gladdens my heart as I know it gladdens all of our hearts to see our dear friend and neighbor, Thomas Linthorne, return to us again. (dog barking) (slow soft music) (birds cawing) (Kate sighs) - Why don't we have Lonzo winter here with us? (sighs) There's no smoke in his chimney. (sighs) He can't even light a fire anymore. - Live here, with us? You sure about that? - He's got no one. We're his neighbors, Thomas. It's our Christian duty. (slow soft music) - Whoa. (Lonzo babbling) (knocking on glass) Lonzo? You all right? (Lonzo babbling) (Lonzo shrieks) - Is that you, Jim? Oh, you come back to me, boy. - It's Thomas Linthorne, Lonzo. Come to invite you to visit. - You've come back to me, Jimmy. After all I done to you. I just, come back. My son. (slow soft music) (Lonzo babbling) - Poor old fellow. Near 90 and all alone. Welcome. Welcome to our home, Mr. Brewster. (slow dramatic music) (glass clinking) (water sloshing) - Spence says his boy Jim's a real piece of business. Probably in the hoosegow somewhere. He had a daughter, too. She ran off with a drifter 15 years ago. Never heard from her since. - (sighs) I don't know how a man goes so wrong with his children. - If it was me, I'd rather be dead and done with it. Left alone, starving, freezing all alone. (slow soft music) (birds cawing) (dog whimpering) Go on. (bird caws) (slow dramatic music) (bird cawing) (dog barking) Springer! Springer! (gun fires) Springer! (dog whimpering) (slow dramatic music) (bird cawing) - [Goram] I gave you a fair warning. I'll kill anything that comes over that hill. - Show yourself, you dirty coward! (gun clicks) (slow dramatic music) Surprised you picked this spot, Schrader. Nowhere to string a wire. - I don't need nothin' but my hands to take care of you, Linthorne. (intense dramatic music) (Goram screaming) (men grunting) (birds cawing) (Goram grunts) (intense dramatic music) (Goram grunts) (men grunting) (Thomas groans) (Goram coughing) (Goram grunts) (intense dramatic music) (birds cawing) (Thomas grunting) (birds cawing) (Thomas panting) (slow dramatic music) (Thomas grunting) (body thuds) (Kate grunting) (child shouts) (Lonzo laughing) (door slams) (Thomas panting) - [Kate] Thomas? What happened to you? - (grunts) Get me upstairs, Kate. - [Child] What happened to pa? - Looks like your daddy had himself a bit of a fall. Don't you worry. He's gonna be fine. (Thomas groans) (Thomas gasps and pants) (slow dramatic music) - I killed Goram Schrader. It was him or me. You're the only person on the whole earth that knows it besides me. I ain't ever going to mention it again. (slow dramatic music) - Startin' to snow. (slow dramatic music) (Thomas grunts) (birds chirping) (gasping and coughing) - You gotta eat, Lon. You haven't eaten for days. - (babbling) I've been a burden on you long enough. I know it's time for me to die. - Oh, hush. No one's dying in my kitchen. - No. Send your good husband in here. (coughing and gagging) (gasping) So, the land is all yours, Thomas. I want it to be that way. I want it to be that way, (coughs) Jim, he ain't never took much shine to ownin' a piece of land. He never gave a hoot for his pappy that boy, never a hoot, not a hoot, no. You just take down the fence and call it all Linthorne. (Lonzo coughing) - You sure about this, Lonzo? - If I was you, I would get me a witness. You don't want Jim lawyering you. And he would, he would, just for spite. Yes, he would. - I think, I think we should sleep on it, Lonzo. - Suit yourself. I'll be gone by mornin'. (laughs) Not gonna see another sunrise. (slow soft music) Not gonna see another sunrise. (coughs) - "I, Alonzo Brewster, farmer, Lancaster Township, Fairfield County, do give my farm and farmhouse, with the buildings and everything in them, to Thomas Linthorne, farmer, Lancaster Township, Fairfield County, to do with whatever he wants to, either to keep it or to sell it." Is that all right, Lonzo? - (gasping) Exactly what's in my head. - You have to make your mark. - Where? - Right there. (Lonzo gasping and wheezing) - I know I don't deserve to die like this. (laughs) - Lonzo? He's gone. (slow soft music) - I'd say the old reprobate was right about that. - Who's to say anybody dies the way he deserves? (slow soft music) - I think Goram Schrader did. (slow soft music) - Do you? - I do. (slow soft music) (birds chirping) - Whoa. (horse whinnies) (hooves clopping) (birds cawing) - Mister. What you want here? (laughs) - This is my farm. - Oh, are you Tom Linthorne? - That's right. Who are you? - I'm Jim Brewster. I heard the old man died. I heard he willed the place to you. - He wouldn't have it no other way. Spence Vitt was witness to the will. - I ain't thinkin' hard of you. Never expected I'd get it. (laughs) Well this here is Lucille. Prettiest gal to ever come out of Curdaling, Kansas. (laughs) I met her traveling through. Sure was anxious to get outta there. (laughs) Weren't ya? Well don't mind, she don't talk much, she's just shy. - How you doin', Miss Brewster? - (laughs) Did you hear that, Lucy? He called you Mrs. Brewster. Ain't anybody ever called her that before. - I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. (slow soft music) - Uh, (sighs). You like to farm, Jim? - Ain't no worse than the other things I done. (slow soft music) (crickets chirping) - How'd you like to have the old place back? - If pappy meant me to have it, he'd have willed it to me. - I have to admit I never thought you'd be back here. Now that you are, seems to me you got some kind of claim. Only fair, the way I see it. What I'm thinkin' of is this. You got nothin' to do, you use my equipment, you work this farm, and you pay me with a cut. Say 10% across what you make? - Well how many years I have to keep payin' you off? - Well I tell you what, you stop your drinkin', you get this place goin', and I'll deed it over. I'll sign my name to it. - We could have a place of our own. Not be wanderin' all over no more. (slow soft music) (birds cawing) - I guess maybe I'll try. - [Kate] I don't know why you're doing this, Thomas, I just don't. - [Thomas] I felt like I was comin' between a father and a son. Besides, we don't need poor old Lonzo's little farm anyway. - (sighs) That is not what you said yesterday. You said it was prime land and it'd be perfect to give Hocking when he marries. Charity begins at home, Thomas. - I felt I had to do it. Let that be an end to it, Kate. (Lucille laughing) (knocking on door) - Uh, Mr. Linthorne said he'd give me a horse and plow, so I come for it. - Howdy, Jim. Good to see you gettin' an early start turnin' ground. Oh, Kate, this is Jim and Lucille Brewster, our new neighbors. - Ma'am. - How do, Mrs. Linthorne? I come to make your acquaintance. - I'm glad to make yours. Why don't you come in? - Follow me. (door closes) - Lon didn't leave anything like a feather bed up there, did he? - [Lucille] I don't know. - You haven't looked? - Ain't come to mind. We don't need any covers yet. - Well, you will come winter. You sew yourself a tick around threshin' time, bring it over here. You can have all my goose down this year, but it won't be enough. You have Jim borrow Thomas' gun and go out to Black Eye Lake this fall. He can shoot himself enough geese to stuff it full. And you can eat roast goose every Sunday night, all winter. - Jim might think that's an awful trouble. - If he don't wanna trouble himself, you've made an awful mistake takin' on that farm. - I think he'll be all right, if I can keep him from drinkin'. - You pregnant yet? - No, ma'am. - You know what's good for you, have a baby as soon as you can manage it, this first year. That's a way to make a man proud of himself. - Yes, ma'am. - You can call me Kate. I'm hardly 10 years older than you. - Really? I thought you was older? - Well, that's farm life for ya. (slow soft music) (sighs) - Don't remember anything about havin' feather beds. - Till you married me. Never heard you complain about sleepin' under one. - Some folks don't care about sleepin' soft. - Never said anything about sleepin' soft. Sleepin' warm I was talkin' about. (slow soft music) Are you just gonna stand and stare? You're lettin' in the cold. (slow soft music) (horse whinnies) - You could put the oats in the feedbag, Grover. That'd be a help. - I don't wanna do that, that's your job. - Do you think I'm your slave? Just because you think Pa likes you better? Do you think I'm gonna do all the chores while you sit around with your nose in some book just to get out of workin'? - Stop it, Hock. He didn't mean anything. (birds chirping) (horse whinnies) (slow soft music) (horse whinnies) - Ow! - [Hocking] Charlotte! - [Grover] Mama! Mama! Mama, come quick! Mama, Hock he spooked a horse and Charlotte fell. (Charlotte crying) - Shh, where's your father? - Saw him cross the pasture to the Brewster's. - Go get him home. Come on, sweetie. Okay, okay, shh, shh, shh, shh. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. - What's happened to my little girl? - It's not as bad as it looks, she'll be fine. - Well then what was the all-fired hurry to get me here? - It's just as well you're here! Hocking says Grover poked the horse with a pitchfork and knocked Charlotte off the stool. - What do you say, Grover? - It's not true, Pa, I wouldn't do such a thing. - Charlotte could've been killed. He has to understand, you have to punish him. - Charlie, you know what happened? - I didn't see. - Hock saw. - I don't know who's tellin' the truth here. I don't know how you know! - Hock doesn't lie! - You saying Grover lies? - Go play outside. (birds chirping) He does lie, Thomas. - I got work waitin' for me. I'll have a talk with him about bein' more careful. (cow moos) Hock and Charlotte, I wanna talk to your brother. What exactly happened, Grover? - Hock don't like it that the horses like me better than they like him. He thinks they should like him more because he's the one that's gonna grow up to be a farmer. - So what'd he do? - He got mad and he jabbed the horses, but he didn't see Charlotte, he never knew she was so close. - Are you lyin' to me, Grover? - No, sir. Cross my heart, hope to die. - Okay. (cow moos) (slow dramatic music) (birds chirping) (sighs) Hocking, I don't want you thinking you can go through life tellin' lies to make your way. Nobody likes a liar. You understand me? - Some people do. Some people like liars. - Are you sassin' me, Hock? - No, sir. - Go on, go back to your chores. (slow dramatic music) (birds cawing) (horse chortles) (bird cawing) Hello? - Mr. Linthorne. Jim's not here. - Too bad. (laughs) Just come to see if he needs any flour back. Goin' to the mill tomorrow. - Might look for him in the tavern. - Well, I guess I could ask the mistress of the house. - [Lucille] Can't pay for any flour. - Don't worry about that. I'll put it on account. Say, 25 pounds? - I'm much obliged. - You like it up here by now? - I've always liked it. I'll like it better when we ought more though. - Well, don't be afraid to call in for things. Of course, I wouldn't say that to most folks, but you look like you got gumption. Right on top of your good looks. (slow soft music) - Nice to hear a compliment again. It's been a while. (slow soft music) - Well, I guess I'll, I'll stop in with that flour. (slow soft music) (birds cawing) This should see you through to November. Think you can bring in what you need for the rest of the winter? - Well, I suppose so. Oh, hey. (laughs) (birds chirping) - It's gonna be a hard winter. Deep snow. Got to get the hay in while you can, Jim. - Well, how do you know that? - Well, I seen a big hornet's nest in a Hackberry tree up on Linthorne Hill. Much higher than usual. That's the sign. That's really fine lookin' bread, Miss Brewster. - That was good flour you brung. Thank you for thinkin' of us. - Um, I forgot somethin' in the house. Just excuse me. (crickets chirping) - Guess I didn't find all the whiskey after all. - Still drinkin', is he? - You gonna throw us off? - No. I don't think you have to worry about that. - Is it true? About a bad winter? - Well, tell you what, one of these days I'll take you up the hill, show the hornet's nest to you all for your own self. How'd that be? (crickets chirping) (cows mooing) (milk splattering) - Sorry to disturb you, Thomas. I'm wonderin', can I borrow the wagon and pick up some supplies I ordered in town? - Sure. Hitch up the mare, she could use a run. - Obliged. - Uh, Jim. (cows mooing) Well, here's a dollar in case there's something you need you can't get on account. - Well that's real kind of you. - I'll just add it to our reckoning. (Jim laughs) (slow dramatic music) (door closes) Anything you need from Lancaster today? - Can always use a packet of needles. - I'll be goin' in then. Don't wait supper for me. - Thomas? (sighs) I'll hang out a lamp for ya. (slow soft music) (gasps) - You got nerve, bargin' in like that. Catchin' me such a mess. - You look all right. - Like this? - I tell ya why I've come, I was, I was thinkin' there wouldn't come a nicer afternoon than this to go down and see that hornet's nest I was tellin' you about. - A hornet's nest? - You remember. - I got lot to work to do. - Oh, I just, I just thought of it is all. - How long would it take? - Maybe an hour. Maybe just a little while longer. - Wouldn't wanna be any longer than that. (crickets chirping) (sighs) (slow dramatic music) Shouldn't we be comin' to it pretty soon? - [Thomas] Oh, don't you worry. I'll get you back in time. - [Lucille] I don't believe there is any hornet's nest. - Oh just you wait, you'll see. - I wouldn't care very much if there wasn't. (birds cawing) We better go home. Jim could be back any time. - He'll be in town till the taverns close. I gave him money. (slow dramatic music) (Lucille panting) (Thomas panting) - Here's Papa. (slow dramatic music) (Thomas sighs) (silverware clinking) (cow mooing) - Say goodnight to your father. - [Thomas] Goodnight, Charlotte. - Goodnight, Pa. - Goodnight, Grover. - [Grover] Goodnight, Papa. - Come on, children, let's say our prayers. - Hocking? (crickets chirping) (paper rustling) I've never known a woman like you. - I ain't never known a man like you. - You wanna see me again? - I wanna give you everything you ever wanted. Everything you never had. (birds squawking) (intense dramatic music) It's Jim, come lookin' for me. He could have a gun. - Shh, come on. (intense dramatic music) Here we go. (gasps) I don't know what you think you're doin' here. - I wanted my babies to see their father with his whore. (intense dramatic music) (Thomas panting) (crickets chirping) (door clicks) - I ain't askin' you to forgive me. And I ain't askin' you to keep on goin' with me. (crickets chirping) I just wanted you to know I been up and I told Jim, and I gave him his place back. Lock, stock, and barrel. I don't know whether it'll make any difference between you and me, but I'll never set foot on it again. - Do you know what you've lost, Thomas? (crickets chirping) - Kate. - What have you got to say to me? (slow dramatic music) (crickets chirping) - I got no words, Kate. - Go away. (sighs) Go sleep in the barn with the other animals. (slow dramatic music) (crickets chirping) (Kate weeping) (sighs) (ring clangs) (lantern rattles) (slow soft orchestral music) (bell dinging) (lighthearted orchestral music) (bell dinging) (hooves clopping) (carriage rattling) (moves into dramatic triumphant orchestral music) - Hocking! Hock! Better get cleaned up now, Hock, they'll be here soon. - You reckon I oughta have a bath? - She might appreciate it. - Charlotte, wait for me. - What is the fifth commandment? - Thou shalt not kill. - What is the sixth commandment? - Thou shalt not commit adultery. (knife clinks) - And what does this mean? - We should fear and love God, that we may lead a chaste and decent life, in thought, word, and deed. And each should love and honor his spouse. (sighs) Can I stop now, Pop? I know this front to back, back to front. - Well, you got to be perfect, Grover. You got to bring honor to the Linthorne name. - I know it just as good as Grover. - Well, you ought to, you been tryin' for two years now. - That's enough, Grover. There's no need to sass your brother that way. - I got more important things need doin' anyway. (Grover laughs) - Eugene and Ralph are bringin' their cousin over. Hocking's sweet on her. - What's this about some Tannersham girl Hocking is sweet on? - (sighs) You'll be polite to her, Thomas. You won't be startin' any arguments with Ralph and Eugene. - All this fuss. Those hellions are in the orchards every night, stealin' apples. Here you are layin' on a feast for 'em? - It ain't Ralph and Eugene I'm fussin' for. - Well who is she anyway? - She's up here visitin' from Sugar Grove 'cause her pa died. Hocking's taken quite a shine to her, she likes him, too. - Where'd he meet her? - Church. - Sure she'll know you with all your dirt scraped off? - Better not stick your nose in it. - Ralph and Eugene are my friends, you remember? - Yeah, that's why they're always laughing at you behind your back. (horse whinnies) She's here already? - Hey, Charlotte? - She couldn't wait to get behind the barn with her charming bull, I mean beau. (laughs) (slow soft music) (pan clangs) - She's a Tannersham all right. - Oh, you just don't think anybody's good enough for the Linthornes. - [Ralph] Hey, Grover. - A man talks straight or he don't. Ain't one in that bunch that do. (slow soft music) - Do I look all right, Ma? - [Kate] (sighs) You look fine. (woman laughing) - I don't like the look of her one damn bit. Tramp if I ever saw one. (Kate sighs) - She's dirt poor hill folk, Thomas. She's ignorant and she's all alone in the world. Seems to me you married a girl just like that. - Oh, she don't hold a candle to you, Kate. - Don't make her a tramp. She's got a good heart and she likes Hock. - Ain't hard to tell about her heart, I guess you damn near see it through that dress. (Kate sighs) - I wouldn't be encouraging this if I didn't approve of her. But I guess you know better. I guess you're an expert on tramps. (slow soft music) (Thomas groans) (Thomas sighs) What I said to you, Thomas, I'm sorry. - It's been 12 years, Kate. I've been true to you from that day on. Some time you're gonna have to forgive me. - I have forgiven you. - No you haven't. Not deep in your heart you haven't. (sighs) (hooves thudding) You're gonna get your confirmation suit all dirty. - If we drove up to the church with the surrey all dusty like this, I'd catch hell for it, wouldn't I? - You could've done it yesterday. - Well, I had the hay to bring in from the river field before it got wet. Grover could've washed the surrey. - Well, Grover had to study his catechism. - Well what if I do make as good a show? I guess I'll get a gold watch too, like you promised Grover, won't I? - What do you and me need with gold watches, son? We're farmers. Look here, that's the kind of watch a farmer needs. I don't know how many cows have stepped on this. Grover's going to college, he needs a college man's watch. Simple as that. I tell you what, you do us proud and I'll give you this old watch of mine. - You mean that, Pop? - Of course I do, Hock. You know I mean what I say. - I know that, sir, yes I do. - Now go on up to the house and get that dust out of that fancy catalog suit before your mother sees you. (slow soft music) (crickets chirping) (people chattering) - What is religion? Hocking Linthorne. You're the oldest one here today. You've had the time and the seasoning to think about the meaning in the words of this book. Perhaps you could tell us. - Religion? That weren't in the book. - Anyone else? - Religion is what you believe about God. Religion is the way a man worships his God. - Well spoken, young man. As you all know, I like to give each child confirmed into our faith an individual confirmation verse, which I hope will guide them in the course of their lives. For Grover Linthorne, I choose the following verse. "For God shall bring every work into judgment, whether it be good or whether it be evil." (slow soft music) - [Kate] Thank you. You know my daughter Charlotte. - [Man] (laughs) He can't lift that bell. - (grunting and groaning) Oh! Ooh, did you see that? I budged it two inches! Two inches I budged it! - You ain't never budged it, Ralph. - Well I did so, I moved it two inches. Look here, I got the blister right there to prove it. - I got blisters on my hands and I ain't even touched it yet. - Why don't you try, Hock? You can do it if anybody can. Remember what you told me about movin' that stone even your pa couldn't lift? Come on. - [Luke] (laughs) I guess you ain't the man you used to be, Linthorne. (audience clapping) (bell clangs) (audience clapping) (people chattering) - Don't do it, Thomas. Let him have the better of it for once. (slow soft music) - I guess a man can be excused if he gives over some of the heaviest work to his oldest son, can't he? (audience clapping) (people chattering) (bell clanging) (audience clapping) - [Luke] Who is that? - I've never seen him before. - Want me to find out, Mama? - You never mind who he is. Just some drifter showing off for a free meal and a bunk. (people chattering) (crickets chirping) - Excuse me, ladies. Linthorne's my name. I don't reckon you'd have much objection of lettin' me know yours? - Sarple. Jed, sir. - Wouldn't be hirin' on for the season, would you? - How much you payin'? - I reckon $15 a month and board would be about right. Wouldn't it? - I'll think on it. I'm obliged to you for offerin'. - [Kate] Time to be goin'. - So soon, Mama? (slow soft music) (crickets chirping) - Right now. (people chattering) - [Thomas] What is it, Spence? - I've been robbed. I had $300 in my coat pocket. - What? Right here in church? Oh, took a real sneaky son of a bitch to do it. (people chattering) (slow soft music) You earned it, son. Never had a prouder day in my life. (birds chirping) And I'm proud of you too, Hock. You tried your best. Guess you and me were just meant to walk behind a plow through this life. - There's an ice cream social tonight, in Royalton. You mind if I go show it off? - Sure. I can't give you any money though. I loaned all my ready cash to Spence today. - Wasn't all your fault that he left all his money in his coat pocket. - He needed it. He pays his hands on Sunday. Anyway, fault doesn't come into it. He's a friend of mine, friend of this family. - Well, I'm all right for money. Been savin' up my nickels. (horse whinnies) (crickets chirping) - Something botherin' you, son? - You said I'd have your watch. Thought I was gonna get it along with Grover at supper. - I know what I said and so do you. I said you do us proud and I'd give you my watch. Isn't that what I said? - I got nervous after Reverend called on me like that, but I knew the regular catechism. - You do me proud, Hock, just once, really proud, and I will give you my watch. - I don't know what I need a banged up old watch for anyhow. (crickets chirping) (slow dramatic music) - [Ralph] Hey, ain't that Grover? - Hey. - Whoa. - Can I go into Royalton with you and Eugene, Ralph? - Who'd wanna ride to the social with some little farm boy who don't even shave yet? - I got money. - Where'd you come by that money? - Found it. - Sure you did. I believe you, I do, just like I believe in Santa Claus. (laughs) - Eugene, get in the back. We should go to the gypsy camp, Grover. (soft lighthearted music) Heeyah, heeyah. Now we can have a whole lot more fun with that kind of money than some ice cream social. It's easy once you get to know 'em, kid. All you gotta do is act like you ain't a green horn. My god. If I had a dollar for every woman I laid with, (laughs) I'd be a millionaire. (women cackling) (Ralph cackling) Hey, Caliope! Whoa! Look what I brung ya. (laughs) (women laughing) (slow soft music) (crickets chirping) - Hi, Pop. Sorry I'm late. Social was swell. - Don't you lie to me! Since when do they serve whiskey at ice cream socials? Since when do they go on all hours of the night? - I'm sorry, Pop. (sighs) Ralph and Eugene showed up. And they had a bottle and they made me have a drink. For celebration. And, I guess I just had a little bit too much. - Remember what this says? - [Grover] Yes, sir. - "For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil." You know what that means? - Yes, Pop. It means you can't hide nothin' from the sight of God. - You never know where drinkin's gonna lead you but it won't be nowhere good. I want you to stay the hell away from those two! You promise me. - I promise. - You're my hope in this world, Grover. Don't ever forget that. (slow soft music) (crickets chirping) Goodnight, son. - Goodnight, Pop. - Beautiful, isn't it? I love the meadows in summer. The abundance of everything. The earth offers us so much more than we think to ask of it. Swells the heart, don't it? - [Charlotte] (laughs) Yes, Papa. - I am so proud of you, Charlotte. Graduating third in your class. You gonna be a fine teacher. - I hope so. - We should have a celebration. Like a party maybe. - (laughs) A party, for me? - You deserve it. You could have all the young folks here about. Lotus and Adolf Sipooni, and I guess we have to invite the Tannershams. (Charlotte laughs) And Judith Brewster. - But she's so young. - Well, none of us know her very much, despite her growin' up a neighbor. Jim and Lucille, they keep her so close to home. Might be a nice chance for her to meet some young folks. Don't you think? - I thought this was a party for me? - Oh, of course it is, Charlotte. I'm just tryin' to be neighborly. (slow soft music) - It's asking for trouble, Thomas. - Looks worse leavin' her out. - She's gonna start the talk all over again. - Let 'em talk. I don't give a damn. - What is it you want with her? Hm? Do you even know? (slow soft music) (crickets chirping) (people chattering) ("Skip to My Lou") (audience clapping) (lively folk music) - Judith. How lovely you look. - Thank you. - Would you like some punch? Mark, Abigail, this is Judith. - [Judith] Hello. - And I think you know my husband, Mr. Linthorne. - Hello, Judith. - Thank you for havin' me to your party, sir. I never been to a party before. - Well, you're welcome here any time. - Surprised you invited her. - Why should it surprise you? - Oh, you know. What people say about her. Oh, Charlotte. (people chattering) (lively folk music) Hey, Judy. How's your mama? How come she ain't here? - Bet old tomcat Linthorne's got a dance saved for her. - Boo! (Judith shrieks) - [Man] Look out! (Judith screaming) (slow dramatic music) - [Thomas] It's all right. It's gonna be all right. Sorry. Sorry. (Judith crying) (Thomas gasping) Whoa. (birds chirping) Here. - [Judith] Oh, you don't have to see me in. - You certain? You want me to explain what happened to your dress, I will. - Goodbye, Mr. Linthorne. Thanks for what you've done. - You're a fine young lady, Judith. I wish I- - Judith! (slow soft music) (birds chirping) Judith, are you all right? What on earth happened? - I'm all right. But, mama, I ruined your dress. I'm sorry. (Thomas groaning) - I been thinkin'. I'd be willing to carve out a quarter section and put it in your name. Good bottom down by the river. - Why you wanna do that? - All you got to do is find the right woman. You get the girl and I'll see to it you won't ever have to want for a little farm. - I got the girl. - She ain't right for this family. - It ain't you she'd be marrying. - This family's come a long way. Your brother's gonna be a lawyer, maybe even run for public office one day. Why would you wanna bring a woman like that into it? What kind of raisin' is she gonna give your kids? (slow dramatic music) (Thomas groans) (rat squeals) Get out of there. (birds chirping) (can clanks) (slow dramatic music) (sighs) (silverware clinking) Caught a rat up in the loft today. I'll set some traps tomorrow. First I guess I gotta clean everything out of there. - Suppose you want me to do it? - No. I'll take care of it myself. - May I be excused? Get a book from (indistinct). - Don't be late. - I won't. - Yup. I'm gonna clean out that loft. First thing in the mornin'. - Are you all right, Thomas? - Guess I'll head over to Spence's house. Got some business to talk over. (slow dramatic music) (owl hooting) I guess it shouldn't surprise me you'd go this low. But it does just the same, Hock! - [Grover] It was just me. - Grover? - What? - Is this what you're lookin' for? Hm? A thief? A common thief? Is that what I raised you up in this family to be, huh? Get over here! - Pop, no! - [Thomas] Huh? (whip cracking) (Grover gasping) - [Hocking] Pa! - Give me my crop back! - No! You're gonna kill him. (Kate gasping) - What have you done, Thomas? - I whipped him. - Why? - Because he needed it! Stole Spence's money! - Thomas. - Get him up to the house. How could he shame us like that? - How? You ask me how? The way you treat him! Like he was some prince! He's what you made him, Thomas. He thinks anything he wants, all he gotta do is reach and take it. (crickets chirping) (slow soft music) (Thomas sighs) - My heart is broken. (Kate sighs) (Kate weeping) (can opens) (Grover whimpering) - You were right to whip me, Papa. I had a whippin' comin', just like you said. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I did it. I'll never steal again. I swear. - I could be a long time forgivin' you, Grover. But I believe you understand what you've done. You remember this night. And I won't ever mention it again. (slow somber music) (crickets chirping) (sighs) I never thought you'd touch me like that again. (Thomas laughs) (people chattering) (equipment rumbling) - [Man] Well, good afternoon, Mr. Linthorne. - [Thomas] What time you reckon to finish? - [Man] At the rate we're goin', we should finish this field by eight. - Fine. (girl shrieks) I won't have it, Hocking, that girl ain't decent. - Seems to me you ain't one to talk about decent. At least she ain't married to somebody else, and I ain't either. - You got no call to talk to me that way, I been good to you, haven't I? - I don't call it good to make me do all the dirty work while everybody else keeps his hands clean, do you? Don't call it good never to give me a penny without me goin' down on my knees for it and beg. I don't call it good to try and run my whole life. I guess if I'm old enough to vote, I'm old enough to pick the girl I wanna marry. - You marry that girl and you'll get out. I won't have her around here, wife or no wife. - I can't marry her, I'll get out anyhow. - I won't have it! I meant what I say and I want you to know it! Come on. (birds chirping) - Well, we're hitched. - What are you aimin' to do? - Farm, I reckon. - Farm where? - That's up to you, I guess. - What he means is we ain't got no planses yet. - You know what I told you, Hocking. I meant every single word of it. - Every word of what? What have you said to him? - You ain't bein' fair, Pop Linthorne. - See, I told you he'd be like that. He can't be the boss of everything, he gets mad. You don't have to tell me twice. (slow soft music) - Hock! Hock. (door slams) (slow soft music) You didn't ask me if I wanted him thrown off! - He defied me, Kate! - He loves her! - Enough! I don't wanna hear his name mentioned in this house ever again! Do you all understand me? - Yes, Pop. (birds cawing) - [Jed] Thank you, sir. - Ain't that the fella that lifted up the bell on confirmation day? What's he want with you? - Oh, it ain't him wantin' with me, I just hired him on. - Well you just fire him then. - Are you tellin' me how to run this farm, Kate? - I don't want him around. You get rid of him! - I have to have a hand. - You want a hand, you go bring my son home! I want Hocking here, where he belongs! (pigs grunting) - What's all that good butter doin' in the hog slops? There's gotta be at least 50 pounds. - A chicken feather fell in the batch. - A chicken feather? One chicken feather? You throw out nearly $15 worth of good butter because of a chicken feather? - You think I'm gonna let one of those rich town women up on Main Street Hill find a chicken feather in my butter? I've got a reputation to think of. - Oh, hell, Kate. You're doin' this on purpose just to get back at me. - You wanna get paid from the butter? Get it from Grover. He's the one who's been stirrin' it since you sent Hocking away. Hocking never let a chicken feather- - I said never to mention his name in this house again! - I won't be told I can't say my own son's name! (cow mooing) (slow soft music) (birds chirping) - What do you wanna be a hand for? My father's gonna be real strict with you. - So I heard. Your mother don't want me here neither, but, I don't care about that. I come here so you can get to know me. - (laughs) Why should I care to get to know you? - I ain't forgot you since the day at the church. I'd have moved on long ago but for that. (slow soft music) (birds chirping) (men chattering) (dishes clanking and clamoring) - Were you raised in a barn? Can't you wipe your plate with your bread instead of bringin' your slops back to me to clean? - I'll do that in the future, Miss Linthorne. (Kate sighs) - Why are you carrying on like this? It's not fittin'. - He eats Hock's food. He sleeps in his bed. I can't stand havin' him in my house. - He's a good hand. - As good as your son? - I have to do what I think is right. - So does a mule. - [Jim] Don't tell me what to do! Or when to drink! I tell you! I'll drink when I feel like it! And you, get out of my face! (slaps Judith) - [Lucille] Jim, you stop that! - [Jim] Why don't you get back in the kitchen like where you belong! Go on, go on with you! (Judith crying) (slow somber music) Stay there! I'll tell you when I'm ready! - [Thomas] I saw something troublin' today, Spence. - [Spence] Mm hm? - Jim Brewster's drinkin' heavy again. - It's a shame. - Shame is how he treats that girl of his. - She growin' up fast. (people chattering) - Spit it out, Spence. - Man raisin' a girl that age, don't feel no kin to her. Man drinkin' every day, there's no tellin' what might happen. (slow dramatic music) (horse whinnies) (hooves clopping) (horse whinnies) - [Jed] Here, give me your hand. - Thank you. (horse whinnies) (knocking on door) I know you wouldn't take charity, Hock, but we're worried to death about you. We know how Orly treats his sharecroppers. - Take 'em home, Char, we don't want 'em. - You're just as stubborn as Pa is. - Bless you, Miss Linthorne. I swear the baby's dyin' of cold inside me. - Get inside, Elva. - Won't you talk to your father for us? Let us come home? - Elva, get inside! You don't tell him nothin', Char, you hear? - Hock! (slow soft music) No, Jed, I... - Don't you want to? - Of course I want to. I love you. But I won't, not until we're married. - (sighs) Your mama won't ever let you marry me. - Didn't stop Hock when Pa said it. (Jed sighs) (Kate clears throats) (Charlotte giggles) - Okay, ready now? - Charlotte? - One, two, three. - Hello, Charlotte? (Kate sighs) - [Ralph] Charlotte! - It's Ralph. - [Kate] Oh. - Excuse me. - I'll ask him to leave. (puffs air) - I got something for you, Charlotte. - Got somethin' for me? I don't know why. - It's your birthday, ain't it? - I'm sorry, I can't accept a present from you, Ralph. - Guess I ain't good enough? - I didn't say that. - I know what you said, Charlotte. Only it strikes me as pretty funny. You think a hired man's plenty good enough. - You don't say that to her. You say things like to me. - All right. - No! (horse whinnies) (slow dramatic music) - It's either him or me, Thomas. He don't go, I will. And I won't turn my hand to a lick of work until he does. - [Thomas] Kate, Kate! - [Charlotte] Let me go. (knocking on door) I love him, mama. - You dare say that to me! This, this, this drifter has taken your brother's place. - It's not about Hock, it's about me. Me, mama. (slow soft music) He's the man I wanna marry. (Kate groaning and gasping) - I forbid it. I want him out of here. Tonight! - You sound just like Papa. (slow dramatic music) - I just assume lose a jaw tooth as have you go. Thank you, Jed. Over here. Like that, now, push it. Wait. (groaning) You all right? - [Grover] Yeah. - Good thing you're goin' to college to be a lawyer. Why don't you go on up to the house, help your mother. (horse whinnies) (slow dramatic music) (horse whinnies) (Thomas groans) (Thomas sighs) I work all my life to make a place for my family, and there I am in my fields, all by myself. - And who do you blame for that? - Don't seem to be any rhyme or reason at all the way things turn out. - Charlotte's gone. - [Thomas] Gone? - She ran off with him. (birds chirping) - Well, we did the same thing ourselves, Kate. It turned out all right. - You think he'll be good to her? - Oh, I know he will. (lighthearted music) (people chattering) - [Man] Push it up! - The Reverend Dr. Garshman. Wonder what he's bringin' that circus here for? - He has the biggest tent revival in Ohio. Folks say he has genuine calling. (sighs) And there are those hereabouts could stand havin' their hearts opened up. - The world is full of people who try to make a man live their lives according to their own beliefs, and yelp, "He's bound for the hot place," if he don't. Well, I figure I can make my way without their help. (slow soft music) (sighs) - Says they found a little place over the river in Kentucky. Close enough to come visit for Christmas if we'll have 'em. I wanna write and tell her to come. - They're welcome here any time. Put that in for me. (slow soft music) (sighs) - Couldn't we go over? Just for a little while? - Oh, there won't be no place to sit by now. - I don't mind standing. - Oh, hell. - Who is going to be saved? Who is going to be saved tonight? (people shouting) - 'Cause I'm a sinner. I'm a sinner. - Yes! Lord, Lord I hear you sister. (Celia crying out) All right! That's what I love. Oh, yes, my sister, I feel it! I feel it! Yes! What do we have here? We have here another sinner caught for the Lamb! Yes! Sit right down in the mercy seat, sister. Y'all take care of her now. Take care of her. At last, at last, you'll meet Jesus at last! (people shouting) Now what do I hear? I hear another. Yes, Lord, I hear another! (people shouting) - Hallelujah! - And this time, could it possibly be a brother? Why don't you come up here and be saved, brother? - If there's one soul in this tent don't need savin', it's Spence Vitt's. - Joy in your bones! Praise his holy name, brother! Praise his holy name! - Lead me to him, brother! - I will lead you to him, brother. I will lead you to the light. You will feel his power! And you will feel his might! (crowd shouting) Tonight! Yes! Everybody say amen! - Amen! - Say it again, amen! - Amen! - Yes! - I'll be damned. - Hush, Thomas. Remember where you are. - That verse of mine, "Confessing Christ as Lord." - Hallelujah! - Amen! - We are saved by grace divine. - Praise the Lord. - Praise the Lord. - Had enough? - Grace divine. - Not yet. - [Man] She's standing up now. - Right this way, sister. And take your place on the mercy seat. Yes! Down on your knees! All is forgiven. - Is that right? Listen, everybody! I guess you all know me. (thunder rumbling) Most of you anyway. I'm Jim Brewster! Lonzo Brewster's no account son! I just came over here to say, to say- - Praise the Lord! Come right down front, brother! God is waiting for you! - God ain't waitin' for me! (thunder rumbles) I just come over here to tell all of ya, to tell ya that Tom Linthorne here stole my wife! You ask him! He stole my, my wife. And what's more, he's pappy to my Judith! Only she ain't mine, she's his. And he's her pappy. (thunder rumbles) You ask him! (slow dramatic music) (Thomas gasping) - [Reverend] Sweet people! This is not the time to run from our Lord and Savior! We're all sinners here! And all will be forgiven when you give of yourself to Jesus. (crowd shouting) (slow dramatic music) (thunder rumbling) (Thomas panting) - (sighs) What's done is done. No sense like you acting like a whipped dog. Either of us. What are you doing? - I have to go over there? - Oh, what for? So one of you can die over this? It could be you this time. - I'm going to bring her here, Kate. He isn't going to have my daughter under his roof one more day. (slow dramatic music) (door closes) (thunder rumbles) (rain spattering) (barn door thudding) Judith! Judy! (thunder rumbling) - [Judith] Mr. Linthorne. - Oh, Judith, girl. Don't be afraid. (panting) You don't have to be afraid of anything ever again. (slow dramatic music) - Are you my father? - Yes. (Judith weeping) Yes, sir. (slow soft music) Where's your mama? - They had the worst fight they ever had. She run off and he came looking for me but I was hid in the woods and then he went into the barn. (Judith weeping) - Did you go in the barn? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (fire crackling) (slow soft music) (door opens) (thunder rumbles) (Judith shivering) - Come sit down. (slow soft music) I don't think you should work today. I think you should go down and fetch Hocking back home. (sighs) I know you love her, Thomas. Guess it's been damned up all these years. You want me to be mother to your child by another woman, I will. But I want my child back. You can't ask me the one and not give me the other. (slow dramatic music) (crickets chirping) (bird cawing) - Hock! Hock! How you makin' out here? - I guess we're doin' all right. (slow somber music) (bird cawing) (crickets chirping) - You don't want your children born here, raised here, do ya? - I plan on makin' it better. - Come on home, Hock. Your mama's askin' for ya. - No sense pullin' up now. We're doin' all right. - Don't be so hard with me. I shouldn't have done what I did. You want, I'll come on in and tell Elva the same thing. - You tell mama we're doin' just fine. She got no cause to worry. (crickets chirping) (water sloshing) (pigs grunting) (sighs) - Stubborn as a mule, that one. Just like his father. (pigs grunting) - [Man] Columbus Lutheran University. Fall out. (slow dramatic music) (people chattering) - 26, this is it. - [Thomas] Well. - You better get goin', Pop. You're gonna miss the train back. - There's $25 there. Of course you can write for more if that gets all used up, but that oughta do till Thanksgivin', the way I figure it. You be a good boy now. You say your prayers and read your Bible at night, same as we do at home. - Yes, sir, I will. - You be true to your name, that's all I ask. - Yes, sir. (apple crunches) - You know I love you, don't you? - Yeah, sure, Pop. (train bell dinging) (train engine puffing) (train whistle blowing) - [Thomas] There's my boy! - [Man] Just a minute, son, I'll get your bags. - Let me look at ya. - [Man] One moment now there, ladies. - What you got in all them things? - [Grover] It's Christmas, Pop. - I thought you were pretty well strapped? - I just got a few things for mother and Charlotte and Judith, here. - [Thomas] And Hock? - Well did you get him a present? - Oh, he won't take anything from me. - I can't see gettin' him a present if he won't even come home for Christmas. (people chattering) I stood first in Latin Composition. Joined the Debating Society. I have to work on my elocution if I'm gonna get elected sophomore president next year. - Sounds like college life agrees with you, son. - Yeah. It's cat's whiskers, Pop. - I want you to tell me all about it. - Well, I can't tell you everything. - Oh. (laughs) (family laughing) You're not eating, Kate. Don't you like your own cookin'? - (sighs) Grown too sacked tonight. I got no appetite. - Best Christmas dinner I ever ate, Ma. - It was wonderful. - Mm, looks like we got plenty of everything left over. - Enough for Christmas dinner at Hock's place, too. Think he'd like a good Christmas dinner with a new baby. - Oh, I guess it's not surprising how much you got left over. Considering how much you made. (Kate laughs) - I can ride it over to them. - Would you, Jed? - Yes, Ma'am. - You tell him, you tell him merry Christmas. ♪ Oh come let us adore Him ♪ ♪ Oh come let us adore Him ♪ ♪ Oh come let us adore Him ♪ ♪ Christ, the Lord ♪ (Charlotte laughs) - Hey, that was great. - Elva was right grateful and sends her thanks. - And Hocking? - Hocking didn't come to the door. (fire crackling) - [Grover] How you doin', girl? It's old Grove. Yeah, it's old Grove. - Fine lookin' animal, ain't she? Best blood lines in the county. - Yeah, she's beautiful. - Something eatin' at you, Grover? You didn't say a word at dinner. (grain spilling) Spit it out. - Pop. I owe a fella some money. (horse whinnies) He says he gotta have it. - Well what did you do with his money? - Nothin', I didn't do anything with it, I just have to pay it. - Then what do you owe the money for? (wind blowing) Hm? Best thing you can do to help yourself is tell me the truth. - Ralph and Eugene, they showed up at school last week and we played some cards, and I lost money that I didn't have. - How much money? - About $50. - $50? - They got me drunk, Pop. Ralph says if I don't pay it, he's gonna report me to school, he's gonna get me kicked out for gamblin'. - And he has this power over you because you were gamblin'! Even though you know the rules! - (sighs) I'm sorry, Pop! (slow dramatic music) I made an awful mess of things. And I never meant to. - Well you just march down to those Tannershams, and you tell that skunk if he ever asks you for a penny again, I'll run him clean out of this county and he knows I mean what I say. - I can't do that. (slow dramatic music) - There's one good thing to come out of this situation, Grover. You got the opportunity to make a man of yourself. Now you stand up to them. You watch them, they'll slink off like the thievin' barn rats they are. - Some of us aren't as strong as you are. - Listen to me, Grover! You got to prove you're a Linthorne. Not to me, you know I got my hopes pinned on you. You got to prove it to yourself. (dove cooing) (Grover moans) Everything all settled then? - Everything's all taken care of, Pop. - I'm proud of you, son. You acted like a man tonight. Leaves you feelin' better, doesn't it? - Sure does, Pa. - [Thomas] Good for you. Come on. - [Man] Ah, let me take those bags for you, sir. - Thanks. You can't ever know what's gonna come of things, can you, Pop? - Well, some things you can know. Hard work, standing up for yourself, you can know what comes of that. - All aboard! - Yes, indeed. I certainly know what comes of that. (slow soft music) - God bless, son! (bell dinging) (train engine chugging) (suitcases thudding) (Kate groaning) - Still won't... Just another. It's comin'! Ah, there! (Kate screaming) You get into bed and stay there. Drink them plum brandy toddies for a day or two. That's your reward for bein' so brave. (Kate moans) - You want another toddy? - (sighs) Just bring me the damn bottle. - Never heard you curse in 25 years of marriage. - The good Lord will forgive me. Go! (horse whinnies) (puffs air) (horse whinnies) (shotgun shells rattling) (door closes) (snow crunching) (Thomas panting) (horse whinnies) (Thomas panting) (hooves clopping) (shotgun cocks) - [Thomas] I'm warnin' ya! I'll shoot! (gun fires) - [Jed] What is it, Mr. Linthorne? - Shot one of them gypsy horse thieves! (slow dramatic music) Oh God. - Thomas! (Thomas gasping) - [Reverend] "For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil." (slow somber music) My friends, we are gathered here to pray for the soul of Grover Linthorne. (Thomas weeping) (slow somber music) (Thomas gasping) (Thomas wailing) (slow soft music) (bird cawing) (bell dinging) (door closes) - [Kate] Someone to see you in the parlor. Maybe you better spruce up a bit. (birds chirping) - Looks like you bettered yourself in the world. Almost didn't know you, Lucille. - We all change. Everything changes. Even our names. You'll have to call me Mrs. Townley now. Is Judith at home? - No. (sighs) She went into town for Sewin' Circle. It's every Wednesday afternoon. - Maybe it's best. I should talk to you first. I want you to let me take Judith back to Cincinnati with me. - Oh. Well, she's old enough to choose where she'll live. - I know I haven't any claim anymore. It's only that I think I can help her a little. - She's been treated right since she came here. She's happy. - I have no doubt she is, Thomas. I knew you would raise her better than I ever could. But she's a young woman now. (slow dramatic music) (birds chirping) Is she really and truly happy? Has anyone asked for her? If she went away with me, there wouldn't be any doubt about her. She'd have a chance to marry well, to have a family, to have the life she deserves after how we started her off. - [Thomas] It's not for me to decide. You'll have to ask Judith. (slow dramatic music) - I want you to ask her, Thomas. I'm going to stay at the Talmage House until Saturday. I know you'll do what's right. (slow dramatic music) (crickets chirping) - Come a day you don't feel so young anymore, you want somebody near ya to depend on. Bone of your own bone. Children of your own. (sighs) I want you to have that, Judith. There's nothin' in this world I don't want you to have. I can't give you that. Maybe she can. You think about it anyway. I'm not gonna say another word, one way or the other. (sighs) (slow soft music) - I don't wanna leave you. I won't. (slow soft music) - Of course you've gotta go. You're gonna be a spinster if you don't. - Do you want me to go? - Think what your life will be after we're gone if you stay. - All the years I've lived here, I never called you mama. I guess I can't start now. (Kate sighs) - I may not be your mother, but I've come to think of you as my own. It broke my heart how brave you were. Despite everything that happened, you just went right alone with a smile for everyone and no bitterness in your heart. - Thanks to you and Papa. - You just go on being brave. And you take the chance she's given you. (crickets chirping) (slow soft music) (people chattering) - You should go now. - I love you better than anyone else on earth. (slow soft music) (people chattering) (crickets chirping) (bird cawing) - Never should've come to this. - But it did. - If I could trade places with him, I would. - The dead belong to God. All we have are the livin'. (birds cawing) (Kate groans) - Kate, Kate, what is it? What is it? (Kate sighing) - My legs don't seem to be able to carry me up and down these hills anymore. - Here. (Thomas grunts) (Kate laughs) - I'm all right, Thomas. Oh, you'll do yourself some damage. - Oh, I'm just as good as I ever was. - (sighs) I don't know about that. I'd like to think I've made some improvements. (slow soft music) (crickets chirping) (footsteps thudding) - What's the matter with her, Doc? - We can do our best to make her comfortable. Beyond that, it's in God's hands. - Well you, you might as well tell me the worst of it. - A day will come, I'm not sure exactly when, her kidneys will just stop functioning. - Well if I took her to the big hospital in Columbus? - I would be the first to advise you to take her there, or New York City, or London, if I thought there was a procedure that would help. There is no known cure for renal failure. There is nothing that anyone can do. I'm sorry, Thomas. (slow soft music) (door closes) - Charlotte's comin' to visit. (Kate sighs) - That's good. (horse whinnies) (birds cawing) (knocking on door) (birds cawing) (door creaking) - It's your Ma. - I'll get my coat. (door thuds) (slow soft music) - [Thomas] That's somebody here to see you, Kate. - Hock. (sighs) You've come home. - [Hock] Yes, Mama. - How I've longed to hear you say so. (slow soft music) (Kate sighs) (birds cawing) (footsteps padding) (Kate groans) - How you feelin'? - Content. How are you feelin'? - I'm thinkin' of making Hock an offer. I'm thinking of signing Linthorne Farm over to him. - Open the curtains, Thomas. Let the light in. (Kate quivering) Come lay down beside me. (slow soft music) (Kate laughs) There were so many times I regretted marrying you. (Kate sighs) Weren't there times you felt the same? - Oh, Kate, I can't- - Shh, it's all right. You can say it. (slow soft music) - There were times. - Here I am. And I have no regrets, none at all. Do you understand, Thomas? (slow soft music) - How can you forgive me? - It is forgiven. You'll know it someday, I know it now. (slow soft music) Ease your heart, my love. God loves you. - [Child] Grandpa, we're here. - [Child] Grandpa, where are you? - It's Charlotte. She's got the whole family with her. (slow soft music) (Kate sighs) - Grandpa! - Hello, Billy. Nancy. There's my Susanna. - How is she? - Go on up. She's gonna be so happy to see you. (Thomas grunts) (slow soft music) (birds chirping) - Mama? Mama? (weeping) Mama? Mama? (Charlotte weeping) (slow somber music) - Goodbye, my love. (clock ticking) (birds cawing) (crickets chirping) Place is lookin' pretty good, Hock. - It's comin' along. - Seems an odd thing to do, work so hard fixin' up old man Orly's property while he bleeds you dry. - Maybe it ain't Orly's property no more. - He sold it? - Sat down with old man Orly and showed him how I'd get him twice the profit out of his land he's gettin', if he'd give me title on this little piece I'm croppin'. So I'm runnin' his 1.200 acres and my 20. - That's good, Hock. Got yourself a bit of land. (birds cawing) Elva must be gettin' pretty close to her time. - I guess so. - Maybe you have a boy this time. Wait till you see him. Wait till you hold your first born son in your arms. - That's your watch. - No. It's yours. You earned it a long time ago. - Oh, I got a watch of my own now. - (sighs) So many mistakes I've made. It pains me to remember that night you claimed this watch after your confirmation and I didn't give it to you. Your mother always said I was too easy on Grover and too hard on you. I was right to be hard on you. I know what it takes to farm. I was out to make a man of you, and I did. Only I should've let you know why I was so hard on you. And I should've let you know that I, that I- - Well why don't you just say what you really want? You want me to come back to Linthorne Farm 'cause you can't do the work anymore. - No. I want you to have the farm. And if that doesn't make things right, you just, you just tell me what it is I can do. - I'd like it if you let me get back to my hoin'. - I love you, son. (slow somber music) (paper rustling) - Congratulations, Mr. Linthorne. You are the father of a boy. (laughs) Finally. (baby fussing) (Elva laughs) - Isn't he beautiful? (baby fussing) Oh, here. - Look at your brother. (baby fussing) (slow somber music) (weeds rustling) (Thomas groans) (Thomas gasping) (Thomas grunting) (Thomas sighs) (slow somber music) - [Hocking] Pa! (laughs) Pa! Pa. (laughs) I guess I love you, too, Pop. (slow somber music) (light uplifting orchestral music) (crickets chirping) (whippoorwill calls) (slow dramatic music)
