Friday, May 9, around 10 PM I'll treat you to Chinese, OK? No, thanks, I have to finish this. Do you see what time it is? Everyone is gone. I have to finish setting up the DNA. I can't let the cells die. Fine, but don't forget to lock up, remember last winter. - See you tomorrow. - See you. Myriam, is that you? Who's there? Myriam, if it's you, this isn't funny. What are you doing here? Why didn't you answer? You scared the hell out of me. Give me that, Paul. Don't play with that. I'm not joking. Give me that right away or else. I need it. Give it to me. Now, can you explain? It's very serious. Yes, it looks that way. I discovered something... about Dad's death. Really? Did you hear what I just said? Yes, you discovered something, now, five years later. Is that what you're saying? Yes. It wasn't an accident. He didn't fall off a train, he was pushed. He was killed and I know who did it. You're crazy. OK, drop it, it's my fault. I was sure you'd react that way. Wait. Put yourself in my shoes. If I were you, I'd at least be curious. Okay. Did you have dinner? Not really. It's on me. Wait. Come on. Good evening, Jules. Good evening, Paul. I guess it's not the right time. Why do you say that? My sixth sense. Are you okay? Yeah, fine, and you? I'm just fine, but my timing isn't. My specialty, it seems. It's silly, I wanted to see you. It's not silly, it's sweet. You know I still think of you. Me, too. Not in the same way, I'm afraid. I think Paul's getting restless. Another time. Yes, let's call each other. I really wanted to see you, but I was sure it wasn't going to be the right time. See you soon. You think I'm crazy, is that it? What would you think if you were me? You come to the lab without warning, take the gun, and tell me Dad was murdered. Sorry, it's a bit over the top, isn't it? I repeat, I'm not crazy. To me, nothing was more important than Dad's death. Just think of Elizabeth's death, how you felt. For Elizabeth, you were seven. Still, I remember her. Not like you, of course. Wait, are you saying Dad's accident didn't affect me? No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying you were already gone, you were elsewhere... and it wasn't an accident. There was an investigation. It was botched. They buried it. What has made you think this? This. Where did you get this? It's not important. Please. A friend from Chalon. I haven't seen him in five years, he found this in the papers, and gave it to me. It's Dad on a train platform. It's the Chagny train station. See the date? Yes, it's the day he died. But is it the same year? It could have been the year before. It's true. It's strange. It was taken just before he got on the train. An hour before his death, not even. So? You really have blinders. Walser? So, it's Walser, so what? He was on the road, according him, at that time. He lied. It's possible. It's more than a possibility. There must be a simple explanation. He was Dad's righthand man. Now, he's the boss. It's as simple as that. Well, if he's guilty, there's always the law. What law? That guy is totally protected, you know it as well as I do. You have no proof, you just have a photo. That's what they will say. I won't let you do anything crazy. You have no control over what I do. I care about you, I don't want anything bad to happen to you. Listen to your sister for once. We have to think. We have to talk about it with a cool head. I'll take you home. Just drop me at the metro. Hi, it's Sabrine. I'm in Paris for ten days. I'm staying with my brother. I'd like to see you. I'm going back to Chalon on the 23rd, everyone sends their love, so do I. Call me back, hugs and kisses. You've reached Paul Rousseau, I'm not in right now. Leave a message after the beep, and I'll call you back... if I feel like it. Paul, it's me. Can you call me when you get in? I'd like to talk about all this. Call me as soon as you can. You've reached Paul Rousseau, I'm not in right now. Leave a message after the beep, and I'll call you back... if I feel like it. Paul, it's me, are you there? Are you hiding? I can't stop thinking about what you said. Well, call me at home or at the lab. You're really not there? Well, call back. Bye. Excuse me, have you seen Paul? Did he come to work today? We haven't seen him for two days. We agreed even days is me, odd days it's him. So here I am and he doesn't even warn me. You've had no idea where he is? I told you I haven't seen him. Maybe he's sick. I don't know, I haven't seen him either. Tell him I'm looking for him. Okay, if I see him. Thanks, goodbye. Goodbye. Two days later... You've reached Paul Rousseau, I'm not in right now. Leave a message after the beep, and I'll call you back... if I feel like it. Paul, it's your big sister bothering you again. Remember me? Please, call. I wanted to give them to you May 1st... but first, First what? I never know when to come, I'm glad I found you. Thank you. I like your hallway, but inside doesn't look too bad. May I come in? No, Jules, it's not the a good time. Goodbye. I see you waste no time. I'm happy for you. There's no lover behind the door, if that's what you're trying to say. I was worried. It's not a good time because it's just not a good time. I'd like to see you again. It's as silly as that... In the book I'm publishing, there's a sentence meant for us, "We must go through the centuries, "never stopping, never looking back, and see the drama unfold. " It's beautiful. You don't see why? I'll think about it. I don't want to kick you out but I'm already out. Well, that's perfect. After perfect, there's Are you all right, did I hurt you? In the deepest recess of my heart. Take care. I'll try. I can't believe it! Miss Rousseau? Yes? Forgive me for intruding. My name is Veronique Lukachevski. My name doesn't mean anything to you... May I come in? It's important for both of us. Yes, please come in. It's so nice here. It's so hard to find something affordable in Paris. I would be in the countryside, if it weren't for my job. I'm Mr. Walser's secretary. I need to speak to you. It's my own decision, Mr. Walser doesn't know. He wouldn't approve. It's totally personal. Do you want something to drink? Yes, a glass of water. You have a real kitchen, it's great. I love to cook, but with my kitchenette... thank you. Is it real stained glass or is it tinted? It's very pretty either way. If you want to talk, come this way. Oh, it's you! You were very... No, it's not me. I'm sorry, I can be so tactless, I'm such a blundering idiot. No harm done. It's my sister. I didn't know you had a sister. I don't anymore. I'm sorry. Why did you want to see me? Well... it's about your brother. Paul? You have another one? No. Is he a bit crazy? Crazy? I don't think so. He came to the office yesterday and he was very strange. You mean he was agitated? More than that. Mr. Walser couldn't see him, he wouldn't see him. He made some remarks, that were... terrible. I can't even repeat them. Has he already threatened others, is he dangerous? Are you worried for Walser, or did he send you? I told you, I came on my own, It is for reasons that are personal. You don't believe me? I don't know. Should Mr. Walser have a reason to fear my brother? I thought you knew him better. Whom? Mr. Walser. We haven't seen each other in a long time. In fact, practically not at all since my father's death. And you think... Why are you here? To see if I like my brother? Is that why you're here? You must think that I'm out of my mind. Not at all. Yes, I'm sure. Forgive me for bothering you. Pax Industries. Hello, could I speak to Mr. Walser? Mr. Walser is on another line, who is calling? Sylvie Rousseau. Sylvie Rousseau? Yes. It's rather urgent. Do you want to hold or can he call you back? Yes, I'm at work, he has my number. Very good. Thank you, goodbye. Goodbye. So how is it going? I think it's working. Look, the cancerous cell frame is positive. And the healthy cells, there are no traces. Can you imagine if it worked! That must be your phone call, you want me to say you're busy? No, I'll take it. Hello. Sylvie? Yes, it's me. Hello, this is Walser. You wanted to reach me? Yes, I'd like to see you, it's pretty important. Nothing serious, I hope. I don't know, but it's urgent. When can you see me? I'm pretty busy, but if you want, at the end of the day, around 6 PM, come to the office. All right? 6 PM, all right. See you later. See you. So? Excuse me, I'm looking for Mr. Walser. Pax Industries? Yes. 618, sixth floor. Thank you. Excuse me, I have a meeting with Mr. Walser. You are I'll let him know right away. Miss Sylvie Rousseau has just arrived. Sylvie, come in. Two iced teas? You're an angel. With two mint leaves? You look beautiful. You're really quite elegant. And me, do I look different? A bit. A bit more fat, huh? How's the research going? Found a vaccine against cancer? You still get funds? Big cutbacks in your field in the past 3 or 4 years. I didn't come here to talk about that. You'd rather talk about your brother? Why didn't you want to see him? Vero told you? Vero? Vero, I call her Vero. She's been my secretary for the past two years. She's also a friend more recently. You do as you please. Answer my question. I didn't see him because he, other than you, didn't make an appointment. I don't have a lot of time when I'm here, and I'm not at his disposal. No thanks, I'm not thirsty. Vero, take it, thanks. You're an angel. Don't you find her beautiful? And strong too, under that frail look. She prevented your brother from trashing my office I assure you, it was quite a fit. What got into him? He's not well these days? Stop blabbering. You know why Paul came to see you. I recognize you there, always to the point. I know you know it. How long has it been since we've seen each other? Your internship in Osaka, it was 1994. Three years. The time needed to give this company a European influence. I don't care about Europe. Your father... wouldn't agree. We're still number one in guided missiles. I'm sure Paul has something against me. I've known he doesn't like me for a long time, maybe because of your mother, my friendship with her. There's something else he doesn't like. Well, he can do what he wants. If he's set on scaring me, or blackmailing me, or whatever, I pity him, that's all. At his age, he should have better things to do. I don't want to talk to anyone. All right, I'll talk to him. ( in German ) Listen, from now on, I want no one else. Thank you Vero. I have no patience for child's play. I spend a third of my time here. Paris bores me. It's the creation that counts for me. You should understand that. Paul is young. But you, don't let his foolish whims get to you. I would be very disappointed. Why should that bother me? You might not like me, but I like you. I like both of you. I think you're playing... with me... You're hiding something. I'm forced to. I work in secrets, you know it. I'll be seeing you. If you need anything, don't hesitate to call. I'll hesitate for sure, but I'll do it. Goodbye. Two days later... Hello. Yes, it's for you. I can't now, say I'll call back. It's your brother. Paul? Yes, he's calling from the hospital. Here, take over. Hello? What happened to you? Not much, I just got hit by a car yesterday. Are you hurt? No, it's nothing. The bike's fine, I'm at the Salpetriere hospital. Where at Salpetriere? Building "C", room 312, but like I said, it's not serious. I'm coming. I have to go. I'll try to be back in an hour or two. I know, I see you're in a hurry. No, don't say anything. I have an idea, a great idea. I've decided to take you out to dinner. Wait, before you say no. I didn't say no, Jules. We can meet around 9 o'clock actually 9:30 is better. Where? Well, at our restaurant. Fine, see you tonight. Yes? Oh, it's you. You seem thrilled to see me. Does it hurt? No, it's nothing, some bad bruises. I'm under observation, but I'm okay. Will you get out soon? If they don't have reasons to keep me here. Did you hear my messages? I've been trying to find you for five days. I know, I haven't had time for anything. What did you do? I didn't waste time, I found a woman who was Walser's secretary at the time. She testified that he was on the road. So? So it's clear... Everything is clear. I got what I wanted, a written reply from her. The most important is at the end. "Indeed, according to Mr. Walser's wish "I testified that he called me from the highway, "at the time of the death of Mr. Pierre Andre Rousseau. I did it with no hesitation to avoid him useless hassle. " Enlightening, no? So he lied. He lied under oath. You believe me now? He would have to be a monster. Hello. It's Carole. She's my sister. Hello. You showed her the letter? Yes. So, are you convinced? Yes, she's convinced. Did you bring what I asked for? I have it with me. What does she have? Nothing. Sylvie, Stop! Watch it, it's loaded. Don't get involved. You're going to wreck your life. I don't give a damn about my life! Tell her to leave. Is she the nut who put those ideas in your head? I can have some on my own. You're both crazy, totally crazy! So, what is going on? It's not good to get up. You shouldn't bother him, he's sick. You, no one called you. Is something wrong with you? Drop it, I'll lie down. I hope so. And behave yourselves. You too, beat it. Do you realize what you are planning to do? You're out of it, Sylvie. I'll do it without you. You're so clumsy, you wouldn't succeed. I'll have to do it myself. I hope your friend's calmed down. She's not my friend. Do you know when my brother can leave? In a day or two, he was lucky. Thank you. Sylvie, Catherine is gone, she had an urgent appointment. I'm off to see William. The cells are in the incubator. Okay, see you later. See you tomorrow. Pax Industries, hello. Is Mr. Walser still there? Mr. Walser is gone. He asked me to call him. Is he at his home in Paris or did he go to his estate? You can reach Mr. Walser at the Estate around 10 PM, but I cannot give you the phone number. Who's calling? Where are you going? I have something to do. See you later, or tomorrow. There, thank you. Have a nice day, goodbye. I have this ticket to Chalon. Could use it tomorrow? It's good for two months. Can you tell me when the first train is? Tomorrow? Tomorrow morning, yes. The first one is at 7:42 am. Thanks, goodbye. Goodbye. Hello, I'd like a ticket to Chagny via Dijon. First or second class? Second. For right now? Yes. Sorry, first. Hello, do you have any vodka? Of course, with ice? Yes, please. Here you go, Madame, 26 francs, please. There you go. Thank you. Why are you looking at me like that? Oh, no reason. Another, please. 26 francs, please. Did you find it? What are you doing here? What are you doing? She's dead. So, you're up. The girl. What girl? You were dreaming. There's coffee downstairs. Marthe can fix you something. It will be good for you and let you think. Think about what? For example... accidents that look so much like crimes, you can't tell the difference, and viceversa. You have to get a hold of yourself. You're frighteningly pale. Come on, up. What did you do? Me? What did I do? You're right, I'll change. I'll meet you in a minute. What did you do with her? I guess they'll find her in three weeks, or six, in the river... if she floats up to the surface. It shouldn't happen. I almost broke my back. Sylvie, you just arrived and you're breaking everything! You don't look well at all. I'll fix you something to eat. Thanks, I'm not hungry. I didn't recognize you. Robert! Marthe? Yes? Tell me, last night... Last night, what? We slept like babies. We didn't even hear you arrive last night. There you are. Hello, Miss Sylvie. The boiler? Did you fix it? I was planning to do it later. With you, it's always "later. " You really look like you need some sleep. Marthe, can you take these clothes and see if they can be cleaned? That's all for Sylvie, coffee? She doesn't want anything. Leave it. Stay here a day or two, to get a hold of yourself. It won't bring her back to life. Wasting yourself won't either. What are you going to do? Turn yourself in? Does that scare you? The phone is right there. It's a new number, it must written over there. Go ahead, blow your life away, forget why you came, forget your brother, forget everything. Have her eat something. The house is yours. Hello, you've reached Genevieve Rousseau. I'm not here a the moment, I'll call you Why are you here? What did you do? And you, what were you going to do? I haven't changed my mind. Is he here? Your leg's better? Is he here, or not? No, he's not here. I'll wait for him. No. You warned him, you're on his side? Tell me, what did you do? You want to know, I'll tell you. I didn't want anything to happen to you, but since nothing could stop you... it was the only way. I killed. That's what I did, I killed. Him? You killed him? No, not him. It didn't go well. As if it could have gone well. It was a girl, a friend of his. He hid the body. In fact, he's an accomplice. Why did you do that? I did it to save you. You hear me, to save you. I did it all wrong, it's my problem. But it's my fault. It doesn't matter who's fault it is. Just leave me alone. I'm staying with you. I won't do anything without you. I just need some time. Are you going to stay here, or not? I don't know, I don't know anything anymore. You have to help me. The only thing you can do for me now, is to leave. Promise me. Promise me. What are you going to do. I don't know. You know I'll there for you. I'll be back. You want some help? Sure, if you want. Is something wrong? You went into Elizabeth's old bedroom, is that it? I shouldn't have said that. No, I wasn't in Elizabeth's bedroom. Do you think about it sometimes. About Elizabeth? Yes, Elizabeth. Not sometimes, all the time. Even fifteen years later? Yes, even fifteen years later. I never had a friend like her. I know. I hated you for a long time. The two older girls, always together. I was the little twelve yearold, I didn't count. You were the boss's daughters. Despite being her best friend and all, I envied that child. That child? You were as much of a child. I was never a child. At five, I was already big in my head. But she, at thirteen, she already had breasts. She was pretty. She had everything. She wasn't even fifteen. Why she do that, why did she jump? I never understood. Did you understand why? No. She had changed suddenly, just before, ten or fifteen days before. She did everything as usual, but she had changed. Even with me, and with Paul, not a smile. Not a single word. She wasn't the same. What could have gone through her head? I don't know. It certainly wasn't a heartbreak. All the boys at school were in love with her. But she didn't care. You haven't even seen my kids yet. Yes, I saw them in the park. They've grown a lot since last time. Yes. There you go. The nights are cool, even in summer. In the beginning, I would systematically get these wonderful colds. No, thank you. I'd say it's the price to pay for peace, the landscape, the beauty... You really don't want any? I'd like you to shut up. I did it for you. She's not hungry anymore. Keep some for tomorrow. It won't be good anymore. What's wrong with you? Taste it at least. Marthe. You're shocked, it's normal. Do as I do, try not to think of it. You should do something to keep busy. Why are you like that? Like what? With me. Maybe because I feel lonely. You could stay a bit, I need someone to sort the mail, the faxes. I told you, I like you. Oddly enough, it's still true. I don't like you. You won't have to see me, most of the time I'm at the plant or in Paris. You'll have access to all that is mine. If I were you, I'd accept. Hello, you've reached Genevieve Rousseau. I'm not here at the moment. I'll call back as soon as possible, thank you. Mother, it's me, Sylvie. It's Friday evening, I need to talk. I'm not far from home, I'm at the Estate. I'll call later. A hug... A big hug. Yes, hello. Hello, it's me. I was going to call you. We have to get together. Something wrong? Not really. Is Sylvie there? She left me two messages, I'm a bit worried. I am happy to hear your voice. May I speak to her? I think she's sleeping. You're at home? Yes. I'll be there in half an hour. How is Sylvie? I'll explain. See you right away. I'll be waiting. Always creating something. I wish! What is Sylvie doing at the Estate? She rarely calls me. And Paul? Did he try to reach you? No, why? I think he will arrive soon. If you have something to say, say it. What's happening? I'll try to tell you, not too brutally. If that's possible at all... your children are growing, too quickly perhaps. They are beginning to understand too many things. That is? You don't know? Pierre Andre? Yes. We weren't supposed to talk about it, ever. For things not to happen, we had to do more than just keep quiet. If I understand you, what we feared these past five years is happening. Don't worry, you're not involved yet. I'm taking care of everything. I'm trying. I'll handle Sylvie, now for Paul Now I understand why Sylvie called me. I think she needs you to confide in. She expects me to talk to her. Talk to her, if you want. Be careful... She's fragile right now, you can imagine. If such is the case, my dear Walser, there's only one thing to do, wait. Wait, you mean lie down and sleep. Try whatever you want. I won't prevent you... I'll even admire you. But when an avalanche falls,... I know... it falls... we don't know when, we don't know on whom, but we know it will. I won't give up. We'll both need to be strong. Strength is not what is lacking. Funny, I never thought I'd need strength to go against my children. You live dangerously. I'll destroy you any way I can. You've read too many of those newspapers you sell, kid. It's getting to your brain. You go ahead and joke. But you're through, and you know it. You think you know everything, but you know nothing. What did you see? A bad photo, and you make a big deal out of it. What does it prove? It proves the truth. Nothing, it proves nothing at all. It proves I did a detour to see your father. I could have had a thousand reasons for that. A half an hour later, he was dead. What was your reason to see him? Now you want to talk. You're less stupid than I thought. Don't try to mess with me. Answer. I had urgent information for him, last minute. What was it? Top secret. You won't get away with an answer like that. But yes, yes, use your head. Even if I had a motive, do you think with the means I have, I'd do it myself? There are 200 professionals in France, at least, waiting to be called upon. Why didn't you mention your presence at the inquiry? "Mention your presence," you talk like the papers... I asked a question, answer! I was stunned, I forgot. Then I didn't want to contradict myself. That doesn't work. That's a lousy answer. Lousy maybe, but that's the way it is. I think you have something scratching you there... Excuse me, I'm expected at the plant. I felt I had succeeded in It's good to see you eating like this. Wait for what's next. Rabbit in plumsauce homemade. Thank you, Marthe. Spare us the chatter. I love her, but she can't keep quiet. Yes, Paul. He went back to Paris. I managed to calm him down, I think. Some wine? He wanted to see me? He wanted me. He's like your mother, he wants to know what's happening. Well, you like it here? I can't stand being alone, that's all. In other words, you put up with my company. That's an improvement. Thanks, Marthe. We'll help ourselves. Genevieve was troubled by your messages. What did you tell her? It was no big deal, We talked about the future, time passing. I'll serve you. Some sauce? I'll be back. It's your mother... she wants to talk to you. No, not now. Your choice. Three days later... I am obliged to reassert my position. Our strategy favors Europe without neglecting your offer, taking into account... without neglecting your offer, which certainly is tempting... that is sure to tempt taking into account in view of the incertitude of the present market What is it? A young lady wishes to see you. She has no appointment. I don't see anyone. Have her leave her name, she has one, doesn't she? Yes, Sir, Miss Lukachevsky. What name did you say? Miss Lukachevsky. Have her come in. Yes? Hello, monsieur. It's very kind of you to see me. I am Ludivine, Veronique's sister, she must have talked about me... No... Well, yes. Yes, of course, Ludivine, of course she talked about you. Sit down, Ludivine. What brings you here? I know Veronique is very independent. She talked a lot about you, and since she didn't come home this weekend, our mother is a bit surprised, even worried. It was Pentecost... She usually comes every Sunday. Except once or twice, but she always lets us know. Did you see her, by any chance, this weekend? Did I see Veronique, by chance, this weekend? Is that your question? Yes. I am very rude, forgive me, do you want something to drink? Thank you, I mean no. I am very embarrassed, you should say it's none of my business. No, it's not at all what I was thinking. In fact, I took her with me on Friday, but she... she didn't stay. She left! Just like that. I think she wanted to rest... I mean, the two of us. She must have gone back to Paris. Why do you hide your hands? I don't know. It's my nails. What's wrong with your nails? They're pretty. This is what I propose. I'm a bit busy right now. But if you come back at the end of the day, around six, we'll go to the Estate, and who knows? Maybe Veronique will have the good sense to reappear. You would infite me to the Estate? Invite. Pardon me? "Invite", not "Infite". Yes, of course, "invite," excuse me. So, you're free right now? Oh yes, yes, totally. Well, that's great. I'll accompany you. No, it's not necessary. Yes, very necessary. No, this way. This way is shorter. Top secret. It's beautiful. A bit chilly in winter. Sylvie? Sylvie? Can you come here? Yes. What is it? May I introduce... Ludivine. She's Veronique's sister. Sylvie Rousseau, Pierre Andre Rousseau's daughter. She's here for a few days. Hello. Hi. You know my sister? I met her once. Really, can you Excuse me. Surely you'll have a drink with us. I'm tired. For me, please? Just for one minute. You like it? It is very mellow, supple and wellstructured. A bit feminine, I like it. I studied it for two years, unfortunately it's a dying profession. Actually, not more than any other. In my family, we love good things... Mother makes great marmelades. She made one for Vero. Anyhow, if she's worried, she shouldn't be. Vero simply needs some independence... even from me. She must be in love. I'd be surprised, I would have know it. She tells me a lot of things. Good night. Tired. This vocation for winemaking... How did you get it? I like it, it's fun. It's original, not common for a woman. Accounting is boring. My parents wanted to force me, but I don't want to follow in Vero's steps. That's all. I like the way you jiggle your glass. I don't know the white Mercurey wines too well, actually. You have beautiful hands... they're delightful. I have to go. Overwhelming. So, will you tell me now? What? Your nickname. No. I said no. Please, I want to know. I hate it, it doesn't even exist in my eyes anymore. Don't you like me? No, I don't like you. Are you upset with me? Why should I? I don't know. Maybe because you think I'm easy. No... I'm not easy, not at all. I'm thinking about Vero, and you're thinking about Sylvie. And neither of us says a word. Why don't you respond to my questions? You know, people don't always have to explain themselves. Sylvie, what does she mean to you? She is nothing to me. Liar! I'm sure you're lying. Get dressed. You're jealous? I'm very jealous. I'm fine dressed like this. What should I call you, then? .. I liked what you called me last night! I'm very hungry! Do you think she's there? Oh, don't think about her. I'm scared. Scared of what? I'm afraid to lose my selfcontrol. I hope you don't. And the little one, Jeanne? Jeanne, she goes back to school next Monday, but right now she's just enjoying himself. Good morning. You look much better than last night! Good morning. Hello, miss. Oh, you're already up. Well, you really guessed it. What do you want, coffee, tea? Coffee, and some bread with jelly. He's got the coffee, the bread is right there. Make yourself at home. Thanks. I'm hungry, I'm really hungry. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yes of course No, not you. Oh, excuse me. Enjoy! If you want to talk, fine, but we don't have to go so far away. What do you have to say to me? What are you doing? What are you playing? Pardon me? What are you doing with that girl? I have to replace Vero. You disgust me. It's not even that. I didn't choose this situation. Oh, you had to spend the night with her? No, I didn't have to. What do you want, her to settle here? I don't have the faintest idea. Listen, it's been several days now that we pretend that nothing Sure you can laugh. I'm not laughing, Sylvie. You have no reason to act this way if you are not afraid for yourself. Let me speak! You pretend you're having fun, but you're panicking, You're scared out of your mind! I want to know. You want to know? You appear in the middle of the night. You blow everything, and you want explanations. You accuse me! Stop it, stop playing with me. Tell me the truth, at least try to! I can't stand it! Do you understand, I can't take it anymore! It's too hard. I know, I see you. So, why won't you help me? I want to help you. Contrary to what you think, I'd like to help you, but how? How? By telling me everything from the beginning. My father's death, how it happened. Did you have anything to do with it? Yes, of course, this is all because of your father. I had almost forgotten. No, that's not true, I don't forget. You ask for something impossible. If it's no, you won't believe me. If it's yes, you're the last person I'd tell. Say it! Veronique's death was an accident, your father's death was an accident. I don't believe you! You see? She doesn't starve herself. It's delicious. If you want to change... you can take Vero's clothes in her room. Can you show her? Now? We're in no hurry, are we? I'm not at all. Are you planning to stay here for long? You mind me being here... I can tell. If it's because of last night No, it's not that. Your sister, you were... are you close? We get along. You saw her here? No, I met her in Paris. I know what you're thinking. No, I don't think so. I understand your feelings. What's happening is not my fault. I have nothing against you. It's not that. You don't know who I am. You think it's hard on Vero, is that it? No, it's not that. I'll talk to her, she will understand. No, you won't talk to her. Let's leave it at that. You won't talk to her because she is no longer here. I don't see why you are so condescending, as if you knew everything. What do you know about my sister and me? Do you hear what I'm saying? Don't yell, I'm not deaf! And stop being aggressive! I'll leave you alone. Good. I'm trying to talk to you. What have we been doing? I'm sorry for everything. Don't worry about it. No hard feelings. Goodbye. Thanks. What did you find out? Nothing. And Walser... Don't talk about him. Hello, you've reached Sylvie Rousseau. You may leave a message or send a fax. Thank you, goodbye. Hello. It's a miracle to hear your voice. It's Sabine. I'm home, we could see each other. Why didn't you call back? Because... Are you all right? Sylvie, what happened? I'm coming, wait for me, I'll be there in fifteen minutes. Fine. You saw Walser, why? I thought you hated him. No. Well, yes but... I don't know how to say this. I You saw Walser, and... something happened between you? Yes. What? Don't tell me you slept with him. Of course not. No, it's worse than that! What is it? I can't explain it. Try. I'm trying, but I can't. I have the same dream, the one I always have... The dream with Elizabeth? Yes. We're at the Estate, she's fourteen but still the eldest, and I am my own age. We're playing a game, a sort of blind man's bluff. I am very happy with her. She's willing to play with me, even if she's two years older. I think it's very sweet of her, and I'm thinking... that I love and admire her. It's a nice day. Then I notice she's disappeared. I am alone... and it's horrible. I wake up and it's even worse. Even fifteen years later, you have the same dream? Yes. Actually it started three days ago. There are variations. There is also... a friend. Well, she's not really a friend. She's a girl, her name is Vero... Veronique. She's dead, too. In your dream? No, in reality. Who is she? She worked for Walser, she was his secretary. Why is she dead? For nothing. She died for nothing, she did nothing. You knew her? Yes, actually, a little bit. How did she die? She died by accident. I'm sorry, I'm insensitive. If you don't want to talk... Her death upsets you? That's it. There were times that I'm anxious every day. At other times there were intervals. And at times I feel it's lifelong. It'll be okay. It'll be okay. You have to rest. Hello. Yes. It's for you. Thanks. Hello? Hello, it's your mother. Are you all right? Soso. A lot of work. I'm happy to hear you, I don't get much news, and to reach you I was a bit worried. Don't worry, I'm here. We should see each other, it's been a long time. I'd like to talk with you. Me, too, but I don't have a lot of time right now. A lot of work as usual. Can you tell me what you do? What I do? Not much in particular, but a lot too at the same time. You're not learning anything new. You were at the Estate, I got your messages. Why didn't you come to see me? We could have talked... Yes, we could have. You talked to Walser didn't you? We saw each other, he came by. Why do you still see that guy? You need him that badly? You know very well he's a bastard. Yes, a bastard! How can you say that? You have no right. I know he's a bastard and I can prove it. You have no right to speak that way. I could prove he's a decent man, even more than decent. You don't know anything. I know more than you think. I don't think anything, I see. But if you want to enlighten me, any explanation is welcome. What I know, my little girl, you shouldn't necessarily know. You know nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing! Stop making excuses! You're afraid, you don't want to know how I am doing. You're afraid of what might happen. You don't know what you're talking about, my little one. I am not your little one! You don't know anything, you're the sorry one. You're the bad one! Now you caused me to break this. Oh, it's me? Yes, it's you! I'm sorry, we have to start all over. It's not a big deal. Yes, it is. Thanks for three pieces of glass, I can do it myself. Sorry, I don't know what I'm saying anymore. Leave it, I'll take care of it. Get some air. Women teachers and researchers have the most nervous breakdowns. Can I help? Actually, it's not a question, I'd like to help. Tell me how. I want nothing from you. You never want anything. You always refuse any help. Don't you want to talk about it? I'm a bit out of it, that's all. We could talk, but you don't want to talk anymore. You're elsewhere. I'm tired. But... I'll listen. I can't talk. I feel I'm living in a nightmare since... I don't even know when. It's hard to talk about it. But one day When? When we finally have a moment together? Don't worry, I'm not interrogating you, I just want you to know I'm here, that's all. It's good seeing you. We can see each other whenever you want, you know that. In fact, I was planning to invite you to dinner. Gladly, but not tonight. Tomorrow, maybe? Sure, tomorrow. Is it a floating date? Yes, I'm floating, but I'm thinking of you. You're alone? I wouldn't mind a glass of something. It's silly to be scared. I'm afraid of what I'm going to say, but since I have to tell you... Surely you have some wine. Even the cheapest kind I'd appreciate. Thanks. Thanks for accommodating me. In wine there's truth. We've fooled each other enough. The time has come to stop lying. I speak the truth, no? You're not drinking? I'm listening. Please, don't talk, don't interrupt, let me finish. I see you understand. I think we understand each other even when we don't. I guess it's not a good start, I knew it would be difficult. Oh, by the way... I think this yours. I thought I threw it with Vero? I almost did, but I couldn't. What I have to say, in fact, you know already. Paul was not wrong. Your father didn't die by accident. He was pushed, and I did it. That's what you wanted to know from the beginning, when you came to my office. I'll try to tell you what happened. I arrived at Chagny shortly before the train arrived. Your father didn't see me. He wasn't blind but distracted, always preoccupied, and with reason. I knew I had little time, I had to act before the next stop, before Meursaut. After... There was almost no one on board at the time. Two kids laughing, a grandmother doing crosswords. That's why your father liked the ride, it was peaceful. He said he got all his ideas on that train. I waited for it to catch speed. I opened the door. I waved to him. He stood up. He came toward me, without understanding what was going on, but without any suspicion. I had always been frank with him. Even with Genevieve. I felt the wind through the open door. One doesn't know what the body can do. I could have pushed a bull... I took him by the collar of his jacket... He didn't have time to realize... He fell on the track, head first. Killed on the spot. I closed the door and locked myself in the bathroom. Two minutes later, we reached Mersaut. I took my car, I drove fast to catch the lost time. I was flashed twice by radar. Close to Paris for me, for my alibi. Just before the tunnel, there was a jam because of an accident. And then, I started crying. I was relieved and sad. I don't know, that's it. You were hoping for something else? Why? Why what? Why did you do that? Of course, that's what you want to know, but unfortunately, I can't tell you. Why? There's a little difference between you and me. Well, several. You don't know what you are doing, I do. You didn't kill intentionally, I did. But there is a similarity between us. In our murders, if you wish. What do you mean? Neither of us had lowly motives. I killed because I had to, because he deserved it, your father. No, don't say anything! Don't interrupt! I had no choice. You're lying. What did he do? The statement and the question contradict each other, no? You're not drinking? I repeat, I won't tell you. Don't try to find out. You'd better not know. What could he have done that was worse than what you did? Sylvie, Sylvie, I don't want to brag... I'm just trying to straighten things out, that's all. I'm basically pretty innocent. Very guilty but innocent. I was so when your father hired me... In '87, a memorable date, ten years ago. If I'd known what to expect, I would have thought twice. Not bad, the wine. I don't regret anything, I try to move on. That's why I came to see you tonight, Strange as it might seem. I'm drained. I'm sorry I couldn't bring peace, just distress, I would have preferred something else. Yes. You don't have any idea where I could find him? I'm telling you, he didn't tell us anything. Do you want the number of the plant at Chagny? Thanks, I just called there, he's not there. I'm sorry. Thank you, goodbye. Yes, hello? Who is this? Is that you, Ludivine? Yes. This is Sylvie Rousseau. Have you seen Mr. Walser, has he returned? No, I don't know where is, I have not heard from him. Thanks. Yes. Mother? It's Sylvie. Hi Sylvie, where are you? At home, in Paris. I wanted to apologize for yesterday. I know I said stupid things, I'm sorry. It doesn't matter. How are you? Bad. I didn't sleep all night. Did you hear from Walser? You're not going to start that again. I'm not, it's just a question. I need to reach him. Can you tell me why? No, I can't tell you. Tell me. I can't. I don't know where he is. I haven't heard from him since last time. You don't have any idea where he might be? Well, no problem. I'll call you back. Kisses. You too, keep in touch. Sylvie! Mother! What are you doing here? Taking the train to Paris. It's no use now, I was going to see you. I'm going back to the Estate. Walser? Yes, I have to find him. I'm afraid. What are you afraid of? I don't know. I was worried, too, you troubled me yesterday. You really have nothing to tell me? You don't want to talk to me? It's too hard. You really want to go back to the Estate? Yes. At what time is the train? In 45 minutes. You want to come with me? If you're willing, yes. Yes, I'd like that. Mother... Walser talked to me. He talked to you? About Dad's death. You don't ask what he said? Don't say it. You knew? You know he killed him? How long have you known? From the beginning. I don't understand. You agreed with him? You were accomplices? I didn't know before. I didn't know he was going to do it. But you agreed with him? Now, tell me why Walser did that. For me. You mean in your place? For his love of me, So I wouldn't have to do it. But when they told you of Dad's death, you were ill. Now you say you wanted it. That's not what made me ill. What was it? What I learned before, just before. What Walser told me just before. What did Walser tell you? Do I have to beg you to tell me? It holds in one word. A name. Elizabeth... Elizabeth, your sister, my darling. Dead at fourteen. What did Walser tell you? Imagine the worst... and you will be right. No. Dad didn't do anything to Elizabeth. I would have known. I was his daughter, too. He wasn't sick. I didn't say that. No, you say he's a monster. Yes, but not that way. Then how? A monster of ambition. He sacrificed Elizabeth out of ambition? You mean he He sold Elizabeth, is that it? Yes, that's it. To whom? He's dead. Who? He was his middleman... without him, contracts are not signed. A contract, no, I can't believe it. It's the truth. He wanted that contract. I didn't know how much. I regret not having guessed... I'll regret it forever. You couldn't figure it out? No, I couldn't. Everything was false. If Walser hadn't come You love him? I'm grateful to him... eternally. Mother... Goodbye. You haven't changed your mind, you don't you want to come home? No, I have to go. Goodbye, darling. Take care. Did you find him? Walser, do you have any news? No, I looked everywhere, He's nowhere to be found. It's strange, no? I don't know. Yes, it's strange, the way he behaved with me, no? I don't know anymore, I just don't understand. By the way, I forgot, your brother is here. Did you see him? No. He must be somewhere. Sooner or later he'll show up. I don't know. You have nothing to do here. As much as you, I need to know like you. Know what? This is not the place to find out. What do you know? Don't ask, I can't say anything. It's too terrible. You have to tell me, I want to know. The only person who can speak to you is mother. What does she have to do with this? Only she has the right to tell you. She knows nothing, you're saying that to get rid of me. No, I don't have the strength. Paul? Paul? Not like that, not with that. You're afraid for him? I don't understand you, you protect that murderer? Him and you. What is it? What is going on in this house? I can't explain it to you, excuse me. Are you all crazy? What's going on? Why isn't Walser here, he's run away? Why is he a murderer? It's not linked to Veronique's death. Who's death? Something happened to Vero? That's what you were trying to tell me the other day. She's dead? Vero is dead? It's not true... It's not true. She's dead? He killed her? He killed her and slept with me. It's not him, it's me. It's me. It was an accident. I killed her. You think I don't understand? You love him, you're protecting him. That's not true. Leave me alone. I don't believe a word you say, leave me alone! Yes? Anne Marie, good evening, it's Walser. I didn't wake you, did I? No, Sir, I was just Well no, I'm not in bed. You had several appointments today. Yes, I know. I had to rest for the day. We'll see about the appointments tomorrow, I mean Monday. Did I get any personal calls? Miss Rousseau called twice this morning, and Mrs. Genevieve Rousseau tried to reach you this evening, the last time at 8 PM. She said it was urgent. Thank you Anne Marie, see you tomorrow Monday. Have a good evening a good night. Bye. Where were you? I was sleeping. Wait. What is it? She knows Veronique is dead. Where is Veronique? Why did you kill her? What are you saying? I told you that Shut up! Why did you kill Vero? Answer? I didn't do it Ludivine. No! No!
