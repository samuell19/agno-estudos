(dramatic orchestral music) - [Narrator] In the autumn of 1897 Jack London, a young Socialist from San Francisco, with his friend Merritt Sloper arrived in Skagway, Alaska, the start of the worst of all journeys, the route to Dawson City in Canada's almost unknown Yukon Territory. This was a moment when the world had gone mad with Klondike fever. (bright piano music) (foghorn blowing) (passengers chattering) - Skagway! (passengers chattering) Someone said it looked like the gate to Hell. Can't be all that bad if there's gold on the other side. (chuckles) Hey, come on, move it. (passengers chattering) Sure doesn't look as if it's fever now does it? - Skagway Midnighter! Skagway Midnighter! Thank you, sir. - Come on, London. - Skagway Midnighter! - Come on, we're on our way. - Skagway Midnighter! - We're gonna make our fortunes. We're gonna take our weight in gold. (men chattering) - Come on! Come on, London! For a stupid Socialist you don't know nothin' about greed, boy. The only way we're gonna get a march on 'em and get our provisions and get out of this mud, den of mud forsaken (grumbles). (wood cracking) (horse whinnies) Get up, don't get involved in that. (fighters grunting) (men chattering) No, no, no, stay outta that. Scene has got nothin' to do with you. (fighters grunting) (men chattering) (gun clicks) - Look out! (gun fires) - Come on boy, we're wasting time. We gotta get outta here. - What was that all about? - Just keep lookin' straight forward, it's all part of the fun. There'll be nine of 'em face down in the mud before we get outta this town tonight. And I don't want the 10th one to be any silly, young greenhorn partner of mine. (bear grunting) (men shouting) - [Fight Observer] Come on, sit up! - My partner's gotta have enough wick to get up over the White Pass, and that means going eight back times back and forwards. - Look, you go get the supplies, okay? - Yeah, yeah well I'd better. I'm gonna find a campsite because I'm not gonna sleep in the mud this night. - Okay, here take this. That'll take care of my part of the supplies all right? - Fine socialist wad you got. - Ah, Sloper! Here. - Jeepers! I'm tellin' ya we're not carryin' these books any further. Shit. Does anybody know where I can get the best provisions in town? (dog growling) (crowd shouting) (dog whimpers) - Good dog now, you just do what you're told and you're gonna make somebody a good sled dog, eh? (crowd shouting) - Hey Ryan, this one's got a name, Buck. (Buck barking) Reckon he was someone's lap dog? (crowd shouting) (Buck barking) - Buck. Let's see if you remember your name when I get through with you, eh? (Buck growling) (crowd shouting) Get it off me, get if off me. Someone get this dog off (grumbling) off me. (ominous music) Eh, you flea bitten mongrel. (crowd chattering) Take this! (Buck whimpering) (Will grunting) (man laughing) (Buck whimpering) Who in the hell are you? - How much you want for the dog? (crowd chattering) - He ain't mine. - Well whose is he? - Mr. Smith's. - Is he around? - No, and he don't like people pokin' their noses into his business, hey? (crowd chattering) (Buck whimpering) (somber orchestral music) - What kinda name they give you, boy? - Name on the collar says Buck. (Buck growls) - Shh. (Buck growls) (Jack grunts) - You crazy amateur. (Buck growls) (Jack grunts) - Easy, boy. (Buck barks) I ain't gonna hurt ya. Nobody's gonna hurt ya no more. (Buck barks) Easy. (somber orchestral music) That's it. That's a good boy. (Buck whimpers) Shh, shh, shh. That's it. There's nobody gonna hurt ya now. No, nobody's gonna hurt ya. (Buck whimpering) You can tell your Mr. Smith that I'll be back later to pay for him. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, you can't take that dog. - Who's stoppin' me? No! (dogs barking) (crowd chattering) (ominous orchestral music) - Come on, Quiche, in ya go. (Quiche whimpering) There's a good boy. That's it. - Mr. Thornton? - Yeah? - I'm Jack London. I heard your dogs and I was wonderin' if you could fix this one up for me. - Yeah, come on. (dogs whimpering) All right, put him down over there. - Over here? - Mm-hm. Good Lord. Are you the one who gave him the beating? Oh, I'm sorry. - You don't know me. - Hey, did he do that? I better bandage it. - Look over him first. Please? - All right. Look, I've just made a pot of coffee. Help yourself. Pour me a cup, too, would you? - Yeah. (Buck whimpers) - Now then, old chap. Where did you find this fella? - I took him from down the street where all the other dogs are. - Oh yeah, Will Ryan. Black beard, teeth like a beaver. Yes, I know him. Breaks dogs for sled work. - How long before he'll be ready to go? - Well, you better leave him with me. Be a couple of days, maybe three. - Well, my partner's not gonna like that. - Hm. You heading for the gold fields? - [Jack] Yes, sir. - All right, boy. - Well thank you, Mr. Thornton for all your help. - You're welcome. - I'm gonna go pay for him. - What, are you buying him from Smith? - Yes. Who is this Smith? - Jefferson Randolph Smith, also known as Soapy Smith. Oh, he comes from down South somewhere, but he got his nickname in Colorado, sold 25 cent shaving soap for $5, made people believe there was a $20 bill (chuckles) hidden in every cake. - Huh. Well is he an important figure here in Skagway? - Mr. London, Soapy Smith owns Skagway. (soft ominous music) - To me it's robbery. I don't think they're that cheap. Hey, what's your hurry, partner? Hey, aren't ya gonna stop and talk? We're still partners remember? (upbeat piano music) Geez, where are you goin'? You must have a terrible thirst on. - Yup. - Come to think of it, I could use a drink myself. Not the whiskey you're after, is it? - Nope. Gonna buy a dog from a man named Soapy Smith. - A dog? We don't need a dog. - Hey! - Soapy Smith? - That's right. - Oh no. I been hearin' about nothin' but this Smith all day. What this Smith wants around here, he takes, and what he takes he keeps. Suppose he don't wanna sell ya his dog? - He will. (Merritt whimpers) - London. (bar patrons chattering) (castanets clicking) (patrons whooping) London, I have to talk to you. Look, whatever you're doin', it doesn't smell right. London. London. London! - Where's Smith? - Who wants him? - Nobody, nobody. I mean, what I meant to say is, my partner here, he's heard a lot about Mr. Smith, a lot of fine words and he's just purely eager to have an admirin' look at him, isn't that so, London? - I wanna see Smith now. - Well maybe you better talk to him over there. - You mean the big fella? - No, the little fella playin' cards. He'll tell ya all ya wanna know about Mr. Smith. - That's not necessary. - Are you Soapy Smith? - That's my name. I'm afraid I haven't had the pleasure. - Jack London. I'm here to buy a dog you supposedly own. - You're Jack London, are you? My handler didn't get your name when you were stealing my dog. - Your handler was beating the dog to death. And I didn't steal him, I came here to pay for him. How much? - $500. - Smart. (bar patrons chattering) - [Bar Patron] Whoa, you gotta be kiddin' me. - That's a lot of money. Gimme 400. - Are you crazy, to buy a dog? - Give it to me! - I haven't got that much left. I mean, I bought the gear, remember? Now listen, listen, London. I mean these people aren't the kind of people to get fancy with. (patrons chattering) - Three on (mumbles). - [Card Player] All in. - [Swiftwater] You wanted to see it, there it is. Ah, finished already, gentlemen? What a pity. I had a feeling your luck was about to turn. No doubt you'll recoup it all, and more, another day. And what about this young gentleman? - Name is Jack London. Mr. London, I present to you Mr. Gates. Mr. Gates, Mr. London. - A resounding name. You a wagering man, Mr. London? - Sometimes, but not Blackjack. - Oh? - Too slow. - Oh well your pleasure. Draw, Stud. - I like to cut high card. (bar patrons cheering) - Oh, sit down, Mr. London. Yes, I'm Bill Gates. Friends and enemies call me Swiftwater. Got the name the summer of '84. Some friends of mine saw me take a fully loaded boat single handed down through a vicious tributary of the Coeur d'Alene. (soft piano music) Now what have we here, Mr. London? - It's Jack. (hand thuds) That's $100. - My dear young friend, that money and you have kept company a good long time, haven't you? Are you sure you want-- - What I'm sure I wanna do, Swiftwater, is shuffle the cards. (deck of cards thuds) (bar patrons groan) (bar patrons chattering) - Well? It's your namesake card, friend. - Mr. Gates. - You can still call me Swiftwater. - Gimme the chance to get it back. - You wanna bet 200, is that it? - 300. - Put it on the table. - I don't have it with me, but I can get it if I lose. - Of course you can. And you will. - Hundred on Swiftwater. - Not likely. - Geez! - We advance a little each time, don't we, Jack? - It certainly seems that way. (patrons chattering) (Merritt grunts) - Well, you've had your little run of luck. And very good luck it was, too. I suppose you're going to take your winnings now and leave. - Let it ride. - Oh-ho. (patrons chattering) - With pleasure. - [Observer] Oh, he can play. (bar patrons chattering) (bar patrons groan) - Ooh. - That's a big card. (upbeat piano music) - Oh! - I don't believe it! (patrons chattering) - [Observer] Well I'll say. - I'm beginning to incubate the feeling that I've been had. - $500. - Dog's not for sale. (patrons chattering) - [Patron] He offered it to him already. - In addition to all the things I've heard, you're a two-faced, welshing liar. (patrons chattering) - London. (Soapy laughs) - And you, my friend, are arrogant, courageous, ambitious, and a little boy. - Don't patronize me! - Oh my word, we're literate, too, aren't we? Put it down. We're not gonna get anywhere that way. (patrons chattering) Ah! (upbeat piano music) (patrons chattering) (castanets clicking) - You crazy, half of a wit kid! You do one more sap stupid thing like that, I'm gonna bust up our partnership. - Suit yourself. - Damn kid! (patrons chattering) (castanets clicking) London! (scoffs) Any one of 'em. Any one of the beggars. Maybe they can't turn out rubbish 10 tons a minutes. Maybe they ain't read as many books. I'll bet any one of them is saner than the idiot half of a wit I saddled myself with. Ah ha, hee hee, ho ho. Look, we get an early start tomorrow morning. I bet we can get most of this stuff out by Porcupine Hill, give us a good push at the White Pass. Did ya hear me, London? I said if we get a good start early-- - I heard you. - Well, give me a sign of life for heaven sakes. How far do you think we can get tomorrow morning? - Well, that depends on if Buck's ready to travel. - Buck? Geez, are you crazy? Are you serious about takin' that dog? Oh you crazy half of a wit. Geez, you're goin' to get us killed before we even leave town for heaven sakes. - Well that's a thing we have to lug all the way over the pass. - (chuckles) It sure is, but wait until ya start workin' with her. Hee hee, ha ha. (chuckles) (dogs barking) (Merritt whooping) I caught the stinkin' thief! - [Man] Let me alone! - [Merritt] Come creepin' in here quiet as an Indian. Lucky I sleep light. I got him just before he woulda jumped ya. - Not true, I came to talk. - [Merritt] Smith sent him in here to kill ya. - What do you want, Swiftwater? - Let me go. There. Now, you and your partner are heading for Dawson City, aren't you? - So? - I've gotta get to Dawson. - Well what's stoppin' ya? - I should be there. I work gold rushes, every one, including California in '49. Of course I was just a boy in that. Younger than you I imagined, yeah? - Slick talkin' pig can swing 'round the point faster than a compass needle at the North Pole. - Swiftwater. - Jack. You see this'll have to be the very last strike that I'm involved in. My last chance. And with Dawson City just sitting up there waiting for me, I can set myself up in a fancy saloon and inside a year I can retire. All I've gotta do is get there. - Then why don't you let Soapy Smith send ya? - It's Smith I'm tryin' to get away from! - You wanna leave, ya walk away. - I'm a gambling man. I can't find the cure. I've even got a rash here that won't heal. I'm proficient at cards. Nobody, well very few, can beat me at the pace boards, but I can't seem to stop there and I've made some disastrous wagers in other areas. - What's that go to do with Soapy Smith? - I owe him money, a great deal. - You do pretty good fleecin' the marks up at the saloon. Why don't you pay him out of your winnin's? - Because the more money I make, the higher Smith's rates climb. And he's made sure I'll never be able to pay him back as long as I'm in Skagway. Take me along with ya, Jack. Take me with you to the Klondike, will you? - You know what he wants, don't ya? Protection. He's lookin' at us to keep Soapy Smith off his back. That's the truth, isn't it? - I'll pay ya anything you ask. - You could pay me every bar of gold in the U.S. Mint and it still wouldn't be enough. Not for gettin' on the knife side of Soapy Smith. (chuckles) No, sir. My vote's no. - Sorry, Swiftwater. - I understand. It was a forlorn hope in any case. - What ya gonna do, Swiftwater? - Oh I'll think of something. - [Jack] I'm gonna go check on Buck. (bar patrons chattering) (upbeat piano music) (door squeaks) - A little bit of this, boys. We're gonna make a fortune. We're gonna take out our weight in gold. (dog whimpers) (dramatic music) (Jack grunts) - Get out. - No! (men grunting) No! (glass breaking) - Tom! Tom, help! Help me, help me! Oh, oh, help me! (somber music) - Where is he anyway? - Keep your voice down, he's all right. - And why can't we head to the Klondike the way we said? - Because it will be dangerous for London to go by way of the White Pass. Now this other trail starts from a place just north of here called Dyea Beach. It's known as the Chilkoot. - If London wants to go another way, that's his business. I'm takin' the White Pass. - Believe me, it would be wiser for you to travel together and the Chilkoot is better. - I'm takin' the White. - All right. When you meet Soapy Smith's men on the way, you can explain that you're no longer Jack London's partner. - I'm takin' the Chilkoot. - [Mr. Thornton] Go on, boy, go on. Hike! Hike! - Hello, Sloper. - Where you been? - (laughs) Come on! - They really did you in. - [Mr. Thornton] Hike! Hike! - [Merritt] Ah, geez. - Ha! Here you are, that's it. - Well thank you, Mr. Thornton. - Ah, good luck. Perhaps I'll drop in on you one day in the Klondike. - Well I owe ya a cup of coffee. - Ah. - And a few thousand other things. I thank you, Mr. Thornton. - [Mr. Thornton] Good luck, Mr. Sloper. - Mr. Thornton. - Hike! (dramatic music) - This your last trip? Stack your stuff up here. This your last trip? Stack your stuff up here. Last trip? Okay, stack your stuff and you come back or leave it. This your last trip? - Yes. - Then stack your stuff up there and come down and join this line. This your last trip? - [Gold Miner] Yes, it is. - Stack your stuff up there and come down and join the line. Your last trip? This your last trip? Okay, stack your stuff and come back down to this line. - [Man In White Hat] I'm much obliged. - [Line Organizer] Stack your stuff, come back to the line. Hold it right there! - You're a good man. - [Line Organizer] Get down there, go on! - I wish you good luck. - Thank you. You go back down? - Yeah, just two more. (dog whimpering) - Good luck, my friend. - Thank you. - Good luck. - Okay, stack your stuff and just come back down again. This your last trip? - Yeah. - Okay, stack your stuff and come back down to this line up. Hold it right there. Now get back in line. - What for? - Canadian customs. - Is this gonna take long? - I don't know, you'll be interviewed when it's your turn by Superintendent Steele, now get back in line. - Interviewed? - That's right. - Do you know what kinda trip we just made? I'm not gonna make no stupid interview. - Get back in line. - Listen, listen to me, listen. Steele? Did you say Sam Steele? - Aye, that's right. - Now you listen to me, and you listen to me good. You and your big hothead mouth has already got us in enough trouble. I'm warnin' ya, and this time I mean it. Don't you run afoul of Sam Steele. - What is he, a policeman? - Yeah, he's a policeman. He's the policeman around here. Everybody in the North Country knows him. They don't call him the lion of the Yukon for nothin'. (chuckles) - Is that so? - Yeah, that's so. He's put down rebellions. He's kept Sittin' Bull sittin'. He's out driv' a railway across this here country. - Which one of ya is Jack London? - I am. - You're aware of the requirements for proceeding onto Canadian soil. Every member of your party must have sufficient provisions to last a year. - Yes, sir, we have them. - My men will check. - I'm sure you'll find everything in order, sir. - I understand ya spent some time in jail, Buffalo. - You seem to know all about my past. - It's my job. Every policeman is part-time historian. - Well does your history book tell you why I was in jail? - Vagrancy. - You believe that, sir? - (groans) Oh London, take it easy, will ya? - Is there any reason why I shouldn't? - No, sir. You're a policeman. - Oh. - And it was policemen who charged in on a bunch of hungry, unarmed men whose only crime was looking for honest work. It was policemen who bloodied us with their clubs and it was policemen who locked us up without a trial in a stinking jail for a whole month. - (groans) London, geez. - Are ya finished, London? - That depends on if you pass us through, sir. - What if I don't? - Well I expect I might find me a few more things to say. - We don't allow riffraff into this-- - Now look, Superintendent! - You look. I will not be interrupted while I'm speaking. Is that clear? I have been given the responsibility for keeping the peace in the Yukon. That's exactly what I'm going to do. We don't need troublemakers here. You and your-- - Now just one fat minute. If ya think him and I are gonna be troublemakers for you up here-- - London. (groans) - I apologize. - No, say what you were going to say. - No, sir, I don't believe I will. What I would like to say, though, although you may not pass me through, I hope you don't let my partner here suffer for the way that you feel for me. - Is there any reason why I should let either of you pass? - Yes, sir, we've come for gold, not trouble. - Ah, gold. Gold can make trouble. - We want to go to the Klondike, sir. - I have no more questions. - Thank you, sir. (Sam grunts) - (stammers) You're gonna, does that mean you're gonna let us through? - See that ya respect the law. - (whoops) Damn, London. We're gonna, we will, sir. We're goin' now. - Uh-huh. (dramatic orchestral music) (bright orchestral music) (Buck barking) - Come on, Buck. (dramatic orchestral music) (bright orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) - [Jack] Well, we finally made it, Sloper. Lake Lindemann. There's enough wood out there to build a thousand boats. All's we have to do is build just one. - [Merritt] And now we're gonna see if your muscle's as big as your mouth. (dramatic orchestral music) - Come on, Sloper, let's get at it! Yeehaw! (Merritt grumbling) - Go on. Oh I, ah! I, I don't like this. (suspenseful music) Where are we? Where are we going? I don't (grumbling), I'm going too, I'm going too fast. I'm going too fast! Holy Jehosaphat! (Buck barking) Stop me! (water splashes) Ah! (Merritt grunting) (Buck barking) (water splashes) God, now he's biting me. Save me, ya stupid (Buck barking) (Jack laughing) maggot face, flea bitten dog. (Jack laughing) Down! (Buck barking) (Jack laughing) Sam Hill are you laughin' for anyway, ya harebrained idiot. Who are you to choose this stinkin' back bustin' route in the first place? - Sloper, you clumsy buffoon! - And you're not gonna get me goin' up the hill again. What's up there can stay up there. - Well, these trees here good enough for ya? - Best I've seen. Gonna mark the whole stand. (soft ominous music) - Hey, you can't cut trees here. All those trees belong to us. - We'll split at the camp, I'll take Ryan. Well where's your mark? - Well we claimed them early. We had no time for markin's. (ominous music) - Come on, Sloper. Well look. Put your mark on your trees and the trees are yours. No mark, no claim. Ya understand what I'm sayin'? (ominous music) Come on, Sloper. Come on. - Hey! How'd you ever get past Mr. Smith? - How'd you get past Steele? I didn't think they let riffraff into this territory. - I got work in Dawson City. I train dogs. - Yeah, so I've seen. Now you can just go get your own trees, beaver face. (whip cracks) Come on. - [Merritt] Hit the old man. (dramatic music) - Ah! - I'll get the gun. Sheesh! (whip snaps) (Jack grunts) (playful music) (Merritt whoops) (whip snaps) - Ow! (suspenseful music) (man grunts) (man grunts) - Hey! (man groans) (Jack cries out) (whip cracks) (playful music) - [Merritt] Hey! (whip cracks) - Ow! (whip cracks) (Jack groans) (Buck barking) (whip cracks) (Jack groans) (Buck growling) - Come on, you scum. (men grunting) We've got ya this time, haven't we? (suspenseful music) (Buck barking) - Well go ahead and kill me! - What? - Well you better kill me now while you got the chance, 'cause if you don't, one day I'm gonna kill both of ya. - Get outta here. (Will mutters) Go on. (whip cracks) (Jack panting) - Thanks, Buck. (Buck barks) Thank you. (playful music) - Thanks, Buck? (Buck barks) (tree creaking) There she goes. (tree thuds) - Timber! (tree splashes) Woo! - Welp, that's it. We've had our fun. Now three more months of your ha ha, ho ho, and your hee hee. - [Jack] Will you quit that? - [Merritt] What? - [Jack] Draggin' it. - Ya fool, look who's talkin'. - [Jack] Come on, quit holdin' it. - Dumb halfwit. You tryin' to teach me how to saw? (Jack grunting) Now you're doing it on purpose. - Doin' what? - I'm blinded down here and you're draggin' it. - Look, I'm doin' my share of the work, more than my share. - Greenhorn of a halfwit. (Jack grunts) - [Jack] Greenhorn, huh? - Okay. (chuckles) I've been meaning to do this. Come on you, you greenhorn. (Buck barking) Get off, let go! - [Jack] Get outta here, Buck. - (grunts) Get that dog off. You get off! (Buck barking) Stop it, off me. Get off me. Dog, get off me. London. (Merritt laughing) Yeah, best boat I ever built, this one. - Ah, well I'd sure hate to see the others. - This here boat's as seaworthy as any you ever shipped on. - Well that's not sayin' a lot, Sloper. (wagon rattling) - [Wagon Driver] Ya. - Hey Sloper, take a look at this. - [Merritt] What are ya lookin' at? - [Wagon Driver] Stop! - Sheesh. - Jack! Jack London! - [Jack] Swiftwater. - Jack London! Jack, my boy. - Hello, Swiftwater. - And the esteemed Mr. Sloper. - You don't mean to say you crossed the mountain in that thing. - [Jack] Oh, you know damn well he didn't, it's impossible. - You know damn well he did. When it comes to the desire for comfort, my dear young sir, the impossible becomes merely difficult. - (chuckles) Your luck sure has changed, hasn't it, Swiftwater? - I told ya I'd think of something. Now come along, I'll introduce you to my traveling companions, though I do wish you were a trifle more gentilely attired. - You got women? - Ah, sh, not so loud. - What's the matter, don't they know they're women? - Sloper, these are not women. These are ladies with considerable theatrical talent. - You got dance hall girls! - Ah, nothing so mundane. These ladies were the toast of Denver. They've come north to admire the wonders of the Yukon. - Yeah, they've come here to cash in on the old gold rush. - (laughs) Jack, you have such a delicate way with words. Well let me say this. The ladies come well-recommended and with cold hard cash. They plan to establish a saloon in Dawson City, a glittering palace dedicated to the pleasure and comfort of the trail weary prospector. And who better to escort them through the vicissitudes of, what's he doing here? - Says he's on his way to Dawson City. - And Soapy Smith? - I haven't seen him. - Oh. I can't begin to tell you how difficult it was to get out of Skagway. If Smith should follow me, but the Mounties would never allow it, would they? Hands away, sir. Ladies, (bright music) you may alight. May I present Miss Belinda McNair. My friends, Jack London and Mr. Sloper. - [Belinda] Gentlemen. - My dear Miss McNair has graciously consented to become my wife. - Let's not start that again, Swiftwater. I told you I'd never marry a gambling man. - [Swiftwater] I assured you, my dear, my wagering days are long gone. - Uh-huh, but you lie a lot. I hear you have a boat. Which one is yours? - That one over there. - How much do you want for it? - Well, (chuckles) it's not for sale. - (scoffs) Everything's for sale, what's your price? - Well, Miss McNair, my partner and I here, we built that boat to take us to the gold creeks and well I really don't think there's anything that could persuade us to sell her. - I do admire a man with principles. Ladies, (bright music) you can come out now. This is Gertie. And here's Louise. (Jack chuckles) (soft orchestral music) - She reached down for him then realized he was dead. She held him for a long time, stroking his hair and kissing his closed eyes. (serene orchestral music) Then she reached for the dagger in her scabbard. She plunged it into her heart and she laid beside him, and with her last bit of strength she took his hand in hers. - [Louise] Oh, that was beautiful, Jack. - It was so sad. - [Louise] It was beautiful. - Shakespeare would have been proud, my boy. - I never knew anybody who could dish out so much, beggin' your pardon, ladies, bull roar as you, Jack. (playful music) - (sighs) Gertie, it's time you and Louise went to bed. - I'm not tired, Belinda. - Yes, you are. - But you said I could stay up as long as I wanted to. - I changed my mind. - All right. Which is my tent? - Take your pick. - [Louise] Goodnight, Jack. - Goodnight, Louise. - [Gertie] Goodnight. - Goodnight, Gertie. (Swiftwater grunts) - How 'bout a look at your boat? (Jack grunts) - It's gettin' too dark to look at the boat. - We can feel our way, can't we? - Sure. Sure. - Hey, that's some good lookin' woman. - Enterprising. She'll make a good wife. - You ain't serious about that are ya, Swiftwater? - Mr. Sloper, at my age a man is always caught between a laugh and a tear. - You're almost as full of it as Jack is. (sultry music) - Don't you think it's time we had a little discussion. - [Jack] Well don't you think we've done enough talking for tonight? (Buck whines) (soft suspenseful music) - 'Til tomorrow then. (soft sultry music) - Goodnight, Belinda. - (muttering) silly wick. (grumbles) - Jack. Come here, please. (soft sultry music) I saw you looking at Gertie earlier. I don't blame you, she's very pretty. - Very. - Do you think I'm pretty, too? - Very. - Should we go talk about it? - Sure. (Louise chuckles) - Ouch. - [Merritt] (muttering) silly. (Jack groans) - [Louise] Thank you. - Sure. - Jack. Jack? (soft suspenseful music) Jack? Jack? Are you out there, Jack? (playful music) - I'm comin', little girl. I'm comin'. Stay right where ya are. I'm comin'. All these women. (chuckles) There you are, my pretty little mouse. Jack's fast asleep. Never fear. (suspenseful music) Yes, Merritt Sloper here to save the night. - Your boat would do just fine for me and the girls and Swiftwater. - (scoffs) That may be good for you, but what about Mr. Sloper and me? - We could squeeze you in. - Belinda, he's my partner. - Too bad. Could've been an interesting trip, but if that's the way you feel about it. - [Swiftwater] You're not thinkin' about trying him? - Why not? He has a boat all ready to sail, probably likes money. - Oh, be careful of him, Belinda. - I'm careful of every man I meet, Swiftwater, lest you forget. - The very last thing I need is one of Soapy Smith's men on a long river trip. - Well I don't know, eh. Who's goin'? - Me, the two girls, and the little gentleman. - Well, you and the ladies, that's just fine. Swiftwater, why does he have to go along. - He does. - Look, why don't ya ask some of the other people around here? I mean, maybe they won't sell ya their boats, but if ya pay them enough they'll help ya build one. You can take it down the river yourself. - I'd have to leave my close friends. - So leave them. How much for the fare? - Well, it's a long trip, eh? Nearly 500 mile. - I mean with all your experience on the Coeur d'Alene. - Because I can't. My name and all that talk about rivers and rapids is just talk. In fact, Jack, the closest I've ever come to whitewater in Idaho or anywhere else is when an angry mark dumped a bucket of laundry suds over my head. - Well, maybe she won't make a deal with Ryan. - Save the sad part, what's the price? - $800. - Ah, the whole tub isn't worth that. 500, take it or leave it. (Will chuckles) - I'll take it. - Congratulations, you've just got yourself some passengers. (Belinda whistles) This way. (playful music) (Merritt groans) - Books. (sniffs) Smells like rain. I said it smells like rain. - Not a chance. (laughs) (thunder rumbles) - How 'bout it, London? Does it smell dry for tomorrow? (Buck barking) Come to the White Horse Rapids before too long. From what I hear about the stinkin' wretches maybe we'd better put out around 'em. - We'll lose too much time. - It's better than losin' the sod-bong boat. Especially after all the rain we've been havin'. Them rapids is gonna bang us around like a cork. - [Belinda] Help, over here! Jack! Sloper! - [Women] Help, over here! - [Gertie] Jack, help! - Hey, look over there. - [Women] Jack! - Over here! - Jack, help! Help! - Well maybe-- - Sure isn't Indians, is they? (Jack chuckles) - Yoohoo! (bright music) - Oh help! - Jack! - [Belinda] Jack! It's Belinda! - [Jack] I wonder what happened to them. - [Merritt] Come on. - When we woke up Ryan was gone with the boat. Swiftwater went on ahead to see if he could hire some men to carry our baggage. I would say there isn't much chance of his finding anybody in this wilderness. He's been gone almost three days. The girls and I were on the point of taking what we could carry and starting out after him, but now that you and Mr. Sloper have come with your boat, you can save us all those days of walking, can't you? - I'll be back in a little while. - Ryan. That dirty, no good, stinkin' wretch! (ominous music) - [Merritt] Them rapids is gonna bang us 'round like a corkscrew. - What's that noise? - What noise? - You never hear anything. - I hear what I want to. - Listen to her. She never says no because she never hears the question. - Well, at least I get asked. - Girls. (ominous music) - This is gonna have to come down. - [Belinda] Shall I help? - [Merritt] Yeah, if ya can. - My dear boy. (soft suspenseful music) - Oh! - Oh dear God. (suspenseful music) (Jack grunting) Ah! Oh! - We're gonna die! - Oh, oh, oh! - [Merritt] Where is she goin', London? - [Belinda] Oh! - I wanna go home. - You can pray with me. - Hang on, oh! - What are you gonna do? - Oh, help. - Oh! - Oh, we're just gonna die here. - [Gertie] Stop worrying, Louise! - Oh! - Sloper! (Merritt cries out) - Sloper. - Yeah! (Belinda grunting) - Up and in. (Belinda grunting) - London! - [Louise] Kill us all, Jack! - [Belinda] Hang on, girls. Hang on. (soft ominous music) (Buck whimpers) - Ladies. (grunts) Hey, careful. Your hand. (thunder rumbles) (somber music) - Want something to eat? (somber music) (serene orchestral music) - Anyone offering breakfast? - Swifty! - Belinda, my love, it confounds logic how you can manage to look totally exquisite no matter what the hour or circumstance. - Good to see you again. - I assume you gentlemen brought these ladies through the rapids? My gratitude. I regret our boat was stolen or I would have easily brought them through myself. - I'll think of you often. - Goodbye, Belinda. - Bye, Jack. - Goodbye, Louise. - Bye. - Goodbye, Gertie. You folks'll probably get into Dawson City in about six days. - But it's not goodbye, young Jack. You'll be in Dawson one of these days. I'll lay you three to one on it. - Swiftwater, are you betting? - Manner of speech! I think there's a distinct possibility that we meet again one day soon. - I hope so, my friend. Sloper, come on. We got a long trek ahead of us. I wanna get to that cabin before that snow comes. - Hey, goodbye. - Goodbye? - Yeah, I reckon. - What's that supposed to mean? - I'm gonna go with them. - What? - Yeah, I just decided. I'm gonna go with them. - [Jack] Sloper. - I don't understand you, and I don't think that's real good for a proper partnership. - You're not supposed to understand your partner. - Yeah ya are. - The hell you are. I've never understood you, Sloper. - Yeah, but ya see, I don't get on your nerves the same way you get on mine. And you're gonna be all right. And these people here, they need a pilot to help 'em get 'em down the river. - Stay with me, Sloper. - No, I'm going with them. - But I can't make it on my own. I need ya. - Ah, ya never needed anybody in your whole young life. - I do now. Aw, maybe I'm gettin' old. - Damn! You dumb half of a wit kid! You get me into all kinds of trouble with that stupid mouth of yours. You know, you stupid you near killed me. Ya know that. Sheesh. (stammers) And what's the use of tryin' to explain anything to ya, huh? Ya never listen. Well, you folks, you better get going. - [Jack] Come on, what ya waitin' for? - [Sloper] What? - You don't want them to get the gold first, do ya? - [Sloper] Nah. (playful music) (Buck barking) (serene orchestral music) We're gonna have to call it quits anytime now, settle in for the winter. Maybe like right now. Sheesh, when you don't want him to talk, he pushes up bull roar so fast you can't even knock it down with a shovel, and when you do want him to talk. - Sloper. Quick! - What? What is it? - I don't know. (Merritt grunts) Oh. (chuckles) Yeah, I knew it was fool's gold. - Gold. Gold. - Gold. (dramatic music) (playful music) Real gold? - Real. Real, an ounce put in the mountain and (shouts). - [Jack] Yeehaw! (men whooping) (Buck barking) All right, yeah! (Buck barking) - [Merritt] Mm, ya (mumbles). (Buck barking) - Gold! Yeah! Whoa, yeah! (wind howling) Sailor or landsman. There is some sort of Cape Horn for us all. Boys, be aware of it. Prepare for it in time. Gray beards, thank God it has passed. - Just as I thought. It's all bull. What's it mean? - Well, that everybody goes through a big crisis. It affects the rest of their whole life. - Why doesn't he just come right out and say it then? - (chuckles) Sloper, if I could say things just half as well as he does-- (Buck barking) - It's just the wind, Buck. (Buck barking) - Did ya hear somethin', boy? Hey, someone's been around here. - You're gettin' cabin fever. (Buck barks) You, too. (Buck barks) - Good boy. Yeah. Good boy. Yeah. (soft suspenseful music) (Sloper sucking his teeth) Will you quit that? - Quit what? (sucking teeth) - [Jack] Sucking your teeth. - I told you you were gettin' cabin fever. Why they hell don't ya get out for a spell, chop some wood. - We've got wood. - Leave me be. - It's not cabin fever. It's just that for once in my life I have found something that I want, that I really want, and it's out there, but I can't get my hands on that stupid gold! - It's not my fault. (sucking teeth) - And will you quit suckin' your teeth! - I ain't suckin' my teeth. - Well then what do you call it? - I'm tastin' a steak I ate once in Seattle. I can remember it as if it was sittin' right here in front of me. Thick, big, juicy, and nothin' with it. No potatoes, peas, it was just blood. It was smothered all over with tomato sauce. - Tomato sauce? (ominous music) - What's the matter with that? - Nobody eats steak with tomato sauce. - I do! - Yeah? Yeah, well you would! - [Merritt] What's that's supposed to mean? (Buck whimpers) - [Jack] Well you can take it any way you want to. - Yeah, well. (fist thuds) Well I will! (men grunting) (objects clattering) I'm stupid, dumb, stinking tired of you and your stinkin' airs. - Yeah? Are you talkin' to me? - I'm talkin' to a phony half of a wit who thinks he's too stinkin' good! - Oh! (Buck barking) Well, you're just a stupid, mean old buzzard. - Who you calling stupid? - You. You, I'm calling you stupid. Who did you think I was calling stupid, stupid? - You armpit. - Whoa! You stupid buzzard. - You git! Go on! - Stupid! (suspenseful music) (men chattering) (guns firing) (Merritt yelps) - That's our stinkin' thief friends, isn't it? (glass breaking) - I don't know, but who cares? Hey, let's make a run for it. - [Merritt] Where to? (guns firing) - [Jack] Sunny San Francisco, come on. (Merritt laughing) (guns firing) (glass breaking) (man groans) (guns firing) (Merritt laughing) (guns firing) (man groans) - [Will] Cover me! (guns firing) (suspenseful music) - [Mr. Thornton] Hike! (guns firing) - Cover me! - Where ya goin'? - I'm goin' up on the roof. - What the hell for? - Can't ya smell? - Go! (guns firing) - [Mr. Thornton] Go on. (guns firing) Go. Go! (guns firing) - Keep firing! - Let's go! (guns firing) - Run! - Yeah! Oh I didn't know this was the road to Dawson. - I came to drink that cup of coffee. - (laughs) Well I'm glad we could give you a little entertainment. - Mr. Thornton! (gun fires) (Merritt groans) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (man groans) - Sloper? Sloper, Sloper. Sloper? (somber music) - London. (Merritt chuckles) (wheezes) You reckon this could be Cape Horn? - What? - Oh, it's somethin' we were talkin' about the other night. - Look, we've gotta get him into Dawson, fast. You got any blankets in there? All you've got, mackinaws, anything. (somber orchestral music) - Hang on, Sloper, we're almost there! - Come on. - The doc'll fix ya up and then we'll go see the girls. - Come on, Buck! - [Jack] Come on, Buck, hike! - Go! - That's it, hike, Buck. - Hike! - Hike! Hike! - Outta the way, please! (dogs barking) Watch, son. Whoa, whoa. (dogs barking) Hey, listen, what's happened here? - Can't you see? - Doctor Riddle, where can I find him? - He's burned to a crisp. They say he was stone drunk. - Well, we've got a wounded man here. Is there another doctor? - Not in Dawson. - Well where's, wait a minute. The priest, Father Judge, he's not a doctor, but he's got a place, hasn't he? - Filled to the gunnels, sir. Father Judge is sick himself, near dead. - All right, Jack. Pardon me, sir. Come on. (dogs barking) Hike! Hike! - Come on, Buck. Hike, come on, hike! There. (wind howling) You try not to talk, okay Merritt? - This'll have to do for now, but we can't leave him here all night. - Yeah, I know. He's too cold in here. I'll be back as soon as I can. - All right. (dog barking) (men whooping) (upbeat piano music) - Jack! Oh, how marvelous to see you again. Aww Jack, you're not being nice, not nice at all. - Yeah. Hey look, I'm in a hurry. Is Belinda around? - Belinda? - Yeah. - Yeah, somewhere. See ya, Jack. - I'm sorry. - Jack. Oh, Jack, oh! Isn't it perfect? Just the way I always dreamed it would be. Oh Jack, come with me, come with me. John, a brandy for Mr. Jack London. - [Jack] I need your help. - Oh. - Belinda. - Look at it, just look at it. (men clapping rhythmically) - Look, Belinda, Sloper's been shot and he needs a doctor. - Oh that's terrible, Jack. The nearest doctor is in Circle City. - Well he can't travel anymore and I need to find a place where he's gonna be safe and warm. - Belinda? - Carl said you wanted to talk to me about something. If it's about your percentage-- - Gertie? - Jack, I knew I'd see you sometime. - I do want to see you, Gertie, but not now. - If it's about your percentage-- - Later. Later. Jack, can't the Mounties help you? - No, I tried, there wasn't anybody. Belinda, Sloper's in a bad way! - Belinda, can I see you for a moment? - I need some help! - It's very important. - We don't give credit. - Belinda, we're out of whiskey. - We can't let that happen, now can we, Jack? Wait for me, I won't be long. - Belinda. Belinda! (patrons clapping rhythmically) - [Swiftwater] 40. - We're gonna be rich, boys. We're gonna make a fortune. We're gonna take out our weight in gold. (upbeat piano music) - Things are terrible in Dawson, Jack. Crowded, cold, people hungry. - Merritt Sloper was on that trail with you. He helped you get here. All's I'm asking for is a room where he'll be warm and... - Jack, you've just arrived. You haven't had a chance to see what Dawson's like. Beds are at a premium. - Maybe a couple of the girls will double up for a few days. I mean, just a-- - Jack. - Jack, come back and see me sometime? - What's it gonna cost me? - Jack. - [Jack] Hey, try not to talk. (Merritt chuckles) - [Merritt] Listen who's talking. Big mouth. - Yeah, big mouth. - Am I gonna make it, Jack? - Damn right you are. - Geez. I am cold. - Yeah, I know. I know, but I'm gonna find ya a place that's warmer, okay? Okay? We gotta get him outta here. - Yes, I know. But where? - I'm goin' back to that saloon, and if they don't let us have a room, they can darn well let us put him in the kitchen. At least it's warmer there. (Buck whimpers) What's the matter, Buck? (Buck grumbling) (ominous music) (Buck whimpering) (Buck whining) (Jack mutters) (Jack cries out) - Jack! - Now you put them down warm for the night. They've had a hard day. (dogs barking) You, come back here, come back here. London. Yes, London. You've come to Dawson City after all, huh? London? Come on, boy. That's it, that's it. All right? I'll pour some hot coffee into ya. And you have no idea who did it? I'm sorry, London. I'm truly sorry. And I'm also sorry about something else that I have to bring up at this time, but the law is the law. Did you and Thornton bring any firearms into town? If you did, I'll have to take them from you. You get them back when you leave of course. Did you? - (sighs) Rifles. - No handguns? - No. - Well that's all right, then. It's the handguns, they're the ones that cause the trouble. - No shooting. You wanna make sure that there's no shooting in Dawson. - That's right. - Well what about the lying and the cheating and the stealing? What about a town that's so cold and greedy and heartless that nobody in it would lift a finger to save a man's life? - Oh, London. - No. No, there's not any shooting in your beautiful little town, Superintendent, but there's no humanity either. There's no pity, no love, just the law, the great blind law. - Jack! Jack, over here! It's me, Swiftwater. I've gotta talk to ya. Jack, I've got to talk to ya. Listen, I came to tell ya Soapy Smith's in Dawson. (Jack grumbles) He's lookin' for both of us. Will ya listen? He's after us, he wants to kill us. (Jack grumbles) At least come over here where we can talk. - [Jack] Where you goin'? - Here, here, over here. I'm going into hiding until he leaves, a place where he'll never find me. You can come, too, we'll both be safe, but we gotta hurry, Jack. - Well wait a minute. You came looking for me? You risked your life. - We haven't got time to stand around talking. Are you coming? - You go ahead. Go ahead, Swiftwater. Go on. - I wanna thank you for taking care of my dog. - He's not yours. - He's my dog, you stole him, and I want him back. Go get him, Ryan. (Buck growling) (Buck barking) - Big Ed, you better get him out, eh? Some reason that dog don't like me. (Buck barking) - Anybody comes near this dog I'll kill 'em! - Hold it, hold it! Back off, Burns. Back off. I'm sorry, that's my fault. I forgot about your spirit, Mr. London. Suppose we had a race? - What kind of race? - A dog race, your team against my team. You win, you keep the dog and I'll throw in $2,000. - And if I lose? - You lose the dog and you go on my payroll for six months. - Well I don't know that Mr. Thornton's team-- - Could I have a private word with Mr. London? - Make it brief. - Oh Jack, you're welcome to the team, you know that, but they're worn out, just come off a long, hard ride. - I accept your challenge, Mr. Smith. - Good. - In four days. - Tomorrow morning. Oh, one more thing. If you don't show, you can bet your life I'm coming back for the dog. (ominous music) (Buck growling) - There. - Okay, you listen to me, Hal. Here, hey, hey. - It's tight. - Listen to me. - Morning. - Now you listen. - Okay, Buck. - Hey, listen. - Good luck, Mr. Thornton. - Thank you. - Now when you feel that whip you're gonna run, eh? - Easy, boy. - Listen here, hey, hey. - [Sam] Have a good race, men. - Thank you. - Good race. - Good morning, sir. - [Sam] Morning, morning. - Jack, you're gonna have to pace them. Now don't let them start off too fast, but on the other hand-- - Don't let 'em get too far behind. - That's right. - Let's face it, you've got a good lookin' team there. - Don't worry. - Jack. Jack! I'm a little upset about Swiftwater. He just disappeared last night and I haven't heard a word since. It's not like him. - Well I wouldn't worry about it. I'm sure he'll be back sooner or later. - Jack, I wanted to see you before the race. I heard about Mr. Sloper and I am sorry. - Yeah. Well look, I've got some things to do. - I'm ashamed of the way I acted. I guess there's something about this place. Good luck, Jack. - (chuckles) Thanks, Belinda. (dogs whining) (upbeat fiddle music) - The rules, gentlemen. The pistol fire will start the race. (upbeat fiddle music) (bar patrons whooping) - We don't open until after the race. - Now the first team which led intact to cross this line will be declared the winner. Now gentlemen, are you ready? (dogs barking) (upbeat fiddle music) - [Man In Floppy Hat] Come on, Swiftwater. An old friend of yours is waitin' to get paid. (Swiftwater grunts) Wait for us. - [Swiftwater] Oh please! (crowd chattering) (dogs whimpering) - Ready! (gun fires) (crowd shouting) (suspenseful music) - Glide! Hike, Buck, hike! Hike, Buck. (crowd shouting) Glide! - Swiftwater. (Swiftwater grunts) - Wait a minute. - Swiftwater. - Don't touch the lady. All right, you go stand by the door, go on. I don't know, Swiftwater. I never thought you'd be a recluse. Sit down. (Swiftwater grunts) I've been doing a little accounting and I've come to the conclusion that the money you owe me just about adds up to your equity in this saloon. - Smith. - I tell you what I'll do. You're a gambling man and I take a chance from time to time, so we'll cut the cards for it. If you win, you get your share of the saloon back and we're even, but if you lose, I get the whole thing. - I can't do that. - Why not? - The other half is not mine to gamble with. - Oh that's a pity. That is a real pity. I advise you, my friend, to make some other arrangement. (Swiftwater sniffs) (suspenseful orchestral music) (Jack and Will shouting) - Get on! - Move on. Come on, hike! Hike! - Over here! - [Jack] Come on, Buck. - Hike! (whip cracks) Ya! (laughs) (Will cries out) (dog barking) Pull over here. Whoa, you mongrels. Whoa, I said whoa. - Hike! Let's go, boys. - Whoa! Ah, come on, I dare you to. Go on, hike! (whip cracks) (dog yelps) Hike! Hike! London! (men grunting) I wanna see you. - Hike! Hike! Hike! - [Belinda] No, absolutely not. - Belinda, it's cards. I've handled them all my life. - Are you crazy? - I'll win. - [Belinda] My saloon. - He owns the other half right now. - You rascal. - Just a minute. - Oh, do you wanna shuffle? - My cards. - [Swiftwater] What? - You can't do that. - Do what? - Use your own cards. - You don't think I'm gonna play with his cards, do you? - Mr. Smith, you could at least use a fresh deck. - We'll play with these. - Not in Dawson City, Mr. Smith. Bring out a fresh deck. I'll break the seal, examine the cards. - [Soapy] What do you think you're doing? - Keepin' ya honest. - [Soapy] My honesty is none of your business. - This is my town, that makes it my business. You'll play with a fresh deck. - Just a minute. Now you listen to me. I've been planning this much too long to let anybody interfere, anyone and especially you. Just a second. I'm going to give you a word of advice if you'd like to achieve your highly flaunted ambition, my friend. I have a lot of friends in your government, good friends in high positions. I want you to get out of my way and I want you to stay out! Is that clear? I thought it would be. (Jack and Will shouting) (suspenseful music) - [Jack] Go on, hike, hike! (dogs barking) Go on, hike! - There boy. (cackles) - There ya go, mush. Wags! Hike! - [Will] Come on, chase him. Hey now, hey now! Hey now. (dogs barking) - [Jack] Come on, boy! - [Will] See it now, London? (cackles) - [Jack] Come on, hike. - [Will] Hey now, hey now. - Hike! Ya, hike! Ya, ya, hike! - [Will] Come on, hike, hike! - [Jack] Hike! - [Will] Giddy up, giddy up. (dogs barking) - I asked for a new deck of cards. May I have them, please? (paper crumpling) (cards flapping) These are ready for play. - I'm not. - What do you mean you're not? - Just what I said. I'm not playing. I mean I merely made you a sporting proposition, which I no longer wish to extend. - But you can't. - (chuckles) Yes, I can. - Gotta give me a chance. - No. - The race! That's it, Smith, we'll bet on the race. (chair tapping) I'll take Jack London. - Swifty. - No wait, wait, wait, wait. (chuckles) I find that very interesting, very interesting indeed. - Cards are bad enough, but a dog race? - Look at the man. Look him over well, him and his friends, how long do you think you'll last with him in here? - The same stakes? - The same. Jack's gonna win, Belinda, I know he will. (suspenseful music) (dogs barking) (men grunting) (Will cries out) (Sam grunting) (Swiftwater whimpers) (crowd chattering) - They're comin'. - Go on, go see who it is, move! (Swiftwater whimpers) (crowd shouting) (Swiftwater whimpers) - Oh, Swiftwater. Oh, Swiftwater. (crowd shouting) - [Man] Surprise! Ain't that all? - Get right back up! - London! (crowd shouting) - Come on, my son. Keep it going. Buck. Go on. Buck, come on. Come on. (crowd chattering) Good boy, Jack. Come on, only a few more yards. Come on, Buck, just past the finish. You've done it! Good boy. Good boy. (crowd chattering) Well done, Buck. Well done, my babies, well done! Well done. Well done, Buck. Well done, my babies. (dogs whimpering) (crowd cheering) - [Ed] He won. London won. (group gasps) Ryan's dead. (group chattering) - Swiftwater. - Huh? Hm? - Promise me you'll never gamble again, not even cards. Swear it. - Will you marry me? - Only if you swear. - I swear. Who won? - Jack won. (group chattering) (chair clatters) - Well, looks like I owe you some money. Why don't you come work for me? - And end up like Ryan? - No. (chuckles) Ryan was stupid, he had no spirit, intelligence. Come on now, work for me. - You're in my way. - Jack. - Move. - Mr. Smith. I want you out of this town. - (chuckles) You can't run me out of this town. - I can. Before dark. - What are you talking about before dark? Nobody travels in this country at night. They'd freeze to death. - You will. (ominous music) - Here. You're gonna need this.

(Buck barks) (bright piano music) - [Narrator] In the spring of 1898, Jack came back to Dawson City, sailed down the river to the mouth of the Yukon, shoveled coal to pay his passage, and arrived back in San Francisco with just $5 in his pocket. Then he sat down to write about the Klondike and the people he'd met on his journey. But that, as Jack would have said, is another story.
