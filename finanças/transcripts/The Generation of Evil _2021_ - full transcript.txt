THE PLOT OF THE FILM IS BASED ON THE MEMORIES OF WITNESSES AND THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE EVENTS. ANY LINKS TO REAL PEOPLE OR PLACES ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL. DEDICATED TO ZIGMAS STANKUS We are the future of our homeland, the children of free and independent Lithuania. Our grandparents and parents fought for our freedom. Congratulations, an excellent job. Now it's the turn of Benas, tell us why you love your parents so much. The reason why I love my mom is because she's the most precious and beautiful. And my dad fights for our homeland to be independent and for all of us to be happy. My dad catches criminals who do very ugly and evil things. And just so happens that today is his birthday! Good job Benas. Do you plan to surprise him? Do you've a gift for him? Principal! THE GENERATION OF EVIL Oh yeah. Fuck! Fuck! Hello. What? Okay. What happened? I've to go. I'll see you tonight. What should I wear? I don't know, ask your husband. - Mr. Prosecutor, good morning! - Morning! What happened? That. - Who is it? - We don't know. The girls at the post office have notified us. Perhaps take it down. Let's not scare the children. It hangs on a steel cable, we can't take it down. I'm waiting for the fire brigade. - See you at the party? - Of course. Good morning, Gintaras. I don't understand how he finds everything. Where's it? We should inform the Child Rights Protection Service. By God, he's a child, curious, interested in everything. It's natural. We can't pretend that nothing has happened. He will be punished for that, because that's my duty as a father. So tell the others that it was just a toy. Have a nice day. - Here here! - Pass it to me, okay. I just wanted to show that I know how to load a gun! Are you going to tell mom? Let's make a deal, my son. Promise me you won't pick up the gun again without my permission and your mother will never know. I promise, I'll teach you how to use it. Done deal? Look, dad, I found a spider. Can I kill it or not? No, Benas, let it go. - Let it live. - Why? Because the poor thing is much weaker than you. If it was stronger than me, would I've the right to kill it? Yes, Benas… probably. Laimonas. What happened? Have done! I need you tonight. Sober! In my house. Why the hell should I go to your house… when you're such a frequent guest at mine? - What are you talking about? - Nothing! They should give you an Oscar. Laimonas, wait! Oh goodness! Testing, testing, testing... Goodnight everyone! I must tell you that today it's a great honor for me to honor a man... of which I am proud with all my heart. Here, in my hometown, in my homeland, a friend of mine works, a very loving father, a patriot... and an irreplaceable commissioner! For this fantastic occasion and for your precious and incredible life! To your health, Gintas! Thank you very much, Rasa. Dear guests, Dear friends. First of all, I would like to thank you for your presence here tonight. And I've tell you that what any man would like to have... ...I already have. Be careful what you do, Antanas! And I'm very grateful for all these years of support. For giving me the opportunity to live... and work… by your side. But in life, everything has its end. I think today is the perfect time to announce what everyone has been whispering about these past few days. From my family... and from my dear wife... I've received permission to try myself in politics and run for mayor. For the future of our city... and the well-being of all its citizens! And how is it that the daughter is not present at her father's anniversary? I don't know. I wonder how... he's going to present his traditional family values to his voters. My most sincere congratulations, Gintas. Listen Loreta... we have to end this. What? We can't go on like this forever. I've already decided. Take good care of Laimonas. It will be better for everyone. And you've to tell me on your anniversary? What did you expect? A letter? By recorded delivery? We're done. Good night. HUNTING BROTHERS FOR GINTAS, FROM THE TIME WHEN WE MET Happy birthday. Happy birthday. We wish you all a happy birthday. Happy birthday. We wish you all a happy birthday. Hello. When? Excuse me. Laimonas... Who has called? The neighbor. We looked out the window and... Question the rest of the neighborhood. They are not sleeping yet. Hello. Arunas, I need the call history of this number, IMEI, IMSI, ownership. - It's very urgent. - What exactly? An SMS with a video, yesterday. 10:30 in the morning. - Okay. - Bye. Oh yeah. Come on, faster! [IN RUSSIAN] THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE KGB Faster, faster! - Comrade Vitalijus! - When the personal files been stolen? I don't know. The electricity went out for 20 minutes, when the crowd has stormed us. - Did anyone seen anything? - No, we're gathering information. - And that's it? - The general is waiting for you. Lithuania! Lithuania! Lithuania! Lithuania! Lithuania! Lithuania! INDEPENDENCE FOR LITHUANIA Lithuania! Lithuania! Lithuania! Comrade General? [IN RUSSIAN] Evil times are ahead, Comrade Vitalijus. We've started a debriefing on the stolen personal files. But... Please, answer the call, captain. Hello. Describe the individual to me. Where are those files? Wait for orders. And keep in touch with the individual. The informant reports, that the suspect is... He's our employee and he has the files. We've to act immediately. I'll send a task force. Not so fast, captain! Tell me, has the informant seen the files? Is he aware of its content? He's, Comrade General. The purpose of punishment... is… not to correct the culprit, but the punisher. Inform all the agents personally, that they are on their own. - Does that mean it's all over? - No, captain. This means that everything is just beginning. It's heartbreaking. Terrible news. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere condolences… to the family, relatives, friends and colleagues of the deceased. It's very painful that such brilliant people leave this world. A real shame. My condolences, Commissioner. Excuse me, Simonas. Attorney General's Office. Attorney General? When did the elite started to worry about the provinces? We care about our own. Especially… in cases like this. I'm here to help. I heard the prosecutor was an old friend of yours. The godfather of my children. Was you the first to arrive on the scene? No. It was my men. I came as fast as I could. You see, I've read the official report. Everything was written down: wallet, keys, cigarettes... except the mobile phone. Really? Even a ruble was found. An old Soviet ruble. But no phone. We'll find it. From what I understand, the gun was his. A hunting rifle. Brno 502. Winchester. And what do the forensics say? Listen! The guy put the barrel to his throat and splashed half of his head on the wall of the room. What's not clear? - Who's he? - From the prosecution... And what is he doing here? Show that he's working. Give him everything he asks for. That phone number you sent me, I've not been able to get an IMSI or ownership. - Just where SMS was sent from. - And? Linden Avenue. Linden Avenue? - There's only one house there. - I know that house. Are you sure it's not an error? I've checked it three times. Forward it to me. Of course, asap after a smoke. - Gintas! What are you doing? - You tell me, damn bitch! I? What the hell are you talking about? Did you use your brains or your ass when you sent that SMS to Laimonas? What? What's this bullshit? Look! The towers gave us your address. Who called whom, who sent what? It's your house! Gintas, for God's sake! Let me go, please! It was your fucking job, Rasa! Fuck! He's the godfather of my children... Why? Is it because of the elections? Are you afraid of me taking your fucking place? Rasa, Rasa… you are going to die. You're going to die like a useless old whore. Keep that in mind! - How are you? - Dad, a couple more shots, please! - Enough for today. - Please, dad! Benas! Your antics at the school could've brought me a lot of trouble. But your father loves you very much. I promise you that we will come here to shoot whenever you want. But first we've to make a deal. Manfully. Promise me… that you won't tell anyone what we do here. I promise. I count on you. Wait. Do you think Aunt Rasa is stronger than you? Benas! She's no longer an aunt for you. If she's stronger than you, then you can kill her, but if she's weaker, you can't. It's what you told me. Shit! Bitch... - Who the fuck do you think you are? - With all due respect, sir... Stick your fucking respect up your ass! - I'm just doing my job. - I don't give a fuck about your idling! This is my city! And I'm the one who decides when to bury and when to exhume my friends! I'm afraid you didn't take the necessary measures at the crime scene, Even a pre-trial investigation wasn't started. What? Do you want me to call the Attorney General? This must be a mistake. No, Commissioner. The weapon found at the crime scene... it couldn't fire a single bullet. I repeat, the weapon was his! It's a Brno 502! - Winchester? - Yes! Winchester! It's impossible, Gintas. But it was there, in a pool of blood! Gun is without a firing pin. What that means? Then how he...? He may have used another weapon. There was no other weapon! But it's clear that the prosecutor didn't commit suicide with that weapon. Goodbye, Gintas. Motherfucker! Laimonas was on the edge for years, he drank a lot. It's such profession. But he had no enemies and no threats. I would have known. He was about to retire and, suddenly, article 129: murder... For no reason. Maybe it's not work related. Did he had problem with his wife? What about it? The house, the goods, maybe an infidelity. It's not something rare. This is gross negligence and there is no doubt that I'll demand that police commissioner Gintaras Krasauskas would take full responsibility for this situation so unfortunate. What the fuck is all this about? What have I done to deserve you to screw up my life even more? Sorry, we have started an investigation. After your search... my husband's gold ring disappeared. I ask you to let the agents in. Your husband may have been murdered. Murdered? What rubbish are you telling me? I'm going to need your testimony. When this happened, you had already left the commissar's party. And do you suspect me? Not necessarily. But have you been noticing something strange… in the behavior of your husband? Maybe he was at odds with someone? Or competing for something? Aren't you cute, prosecutor? Look, ask the police commissioner... What they were competing for? There it's. The prosecutor just got home. And then… someone walks by with a box. Who is he? Isn't that Slava, that prick? Look, take a good look. Here he enters. And no one else enters after him. Stop, Slava! Stop, police! - Stay! - No, let me go, dammit! I did nothing! Fuck off! Leave me alone! I know my fucking rights! Ah, fucking fuck! What were you doing at the prosecutor's house? I don't know any prosecutor! I'm not going to repeat it, Slava! I don't know anything, damn it! I know nothing! Anyway, I'll be on the street in two days, tops. And then you'll be screwed! I'll spread the word! I'm not going to just let this go, I swear on my life! Enough. Slava, Slava… I can hang on you any murder case, I've a stack of them on my desk. In prison I've some guys that will fuck you in every hole you have. You won't even know which hole is which after that. You'll have rectal prolapse and you'll shit your bed. And they will knock your teeth out. You'll be sucking and singing at the same time. And when you're already half dead, they'll anesthetize you and will fuck you again. So those are your prospects now. Take advantage of this opportunity… and talk. I've already… I've already sold it. - What have you sold? - The gold ring. It was on the nightstand. That's why you brought me here, isn't it, friends? - Not at all, Slava. - Then why? Why did you go there? - He paid me to do it! - Who paid you? I don't know, I didn't see him. It was very dark inside the car. I approached and... What car? Well… it was red. It was a dark red car. And big... A minivan. It was next to the gas station. He gave me the box and paid in advance. - What was I supposed to do? - What box? It was the cardboard box like any other. But… I had a feeling that... there was an animal inside. Ah… Hello, Gintas. You caught us in the middle of lunch. - Does it bother you or...? - Enjoy your meal. What happened? I wouldn't even know where to start. I've never seen anything like it. Laimonas didn't die from the shot to the head. The shot was fired after his death. His heart stopped long before. What do you mean? Gintas, he died tortured. They subjected him to slow agony. What are you talking about? Can you explain it to us in simple terms? I don't think that's going to do much good. It had to be unimaginable pain. I still don't know how he lasted so long. With all those wounds in his stomach, The internal organs must have been paralyzed. Then spasms, and death of the internal organs. But his brain was still alive! He felt it all. Absolutely everything! Internal bleeding, seizures… The pain must have been inhuman. Wait a minute, Kestas, how could it happen? I don't know how exactly but we have discovered what caused it. What is this? A viper. I swear on my life that this viper was forced into his stomach through his throat. Forced? Forced, while he was still alive, through his throat. There are acids in the stomach, so it tried to go to the mouth, but the esophageal sphincter blocked the exit. We found many bite marks there. Then it went through the stomach to reach the intestines, and began to destroy everything in her path. We think it tried to force it's way through the anus. But it got stuck in the large intestine, where it eventually suffocated. Poor creature, It's an endangered species. I know from a book. Can you imagine...? How should a person feel... when a huge snake is tearing his guts apart? I don't wish it to anyone. The poor thing felt everything, each bite, each movement, inch by inch. What am I to do with that body, Gintas? What body? The one who hanged himself at the post office, no one has claimed it. I don't know. I've to go. Vytautas, there is someone who wants to see you. Let her in. Please come in. Good afternoon, I'm Vytautas. A pleasure. Sorry for the mess, we are perpetually on the move. Because of happenings lately. Please take a seat. Never mind. It's only a small part. They are destroying all files. Some are taken to Minsk. Soon there will be nothing left. Agent "Viper"? Agent "Moose"? These are just the agent reports. Their workplaces are also listed there. The Supreme Council, the Department of Security, Sajudis... Most of them are KGB agents and there are some double agents, who work for both sides. Be careful after you release the news. It's all we have. We will provide you with all the help you need. That's not what we agreed on. It's a very high price. Listen, Vytautas, It's chaos everywhere, they'll eliminate loose ends. Then no one will ever find them. Now you have a small chance to allow… the next generation to have an alternative. That's the price of these documents. Don't worry. We'll get the money and we'll pay you. Get it tonight or don't contact me again. Never again. - Hello? - Information has been leaked. I've identified both the source and the subject. Informs you 790... 530. - Describe the subject. - Female, about thirty years old. Medium height, slim. Dark and long hair. Round face, big brown eyes. She wears glasses. Where are those files? The subject has them on her. She tries to publish them through the underground press. Wait for orders. And keep in touch with the subject. Hello, Gintas. You're all wet, dear! Hello darling. How the little one? Sleeping. I've prepared dinner. It's been a long time since we were all... Together! Let's eat and chat. How's the weather over there? - I'll call you, mom. - Finish your dinner, Agne! - Where are you going? - Look, I'd rather be somewhere else. Stay with us, where are you going? Mom, don't bother. You can spend the night here. Your mother is right. Please Agne. Your room is just as you left it, I'll go prepare the sheets for you. Agne has passed all her exams and has been accepted to that prestigious London university, the one she always wanted. That's my warrior. And… We agreed that... I'll help her with everything she needs of course, as much as I can... ...each month... she... Agnes has applied for a state scholarship, but... ...but you know well that… we... Agree. You haven't even asked how much it's going to cost. How much? Eighteen thousand euros a year. It's a five years program. It's okay. Gintas… You've a heart of gold. Agne, I already told you that your father will support you. Thanks Dad. You won't build a house on "thanks". What? At my birthday party, which you didn't attend... I announced a few things. I know, mom told me. I'm running for election. I've to win them, Agne. And I plan to win them. Congratulations. I'm very happy for you, but I don't understand why you say that. It will cause a stir. Between the electoral campaign, the journalists… The tabloids and all that crap. If you mean what I think you mean... Yes. I mean exactly what you're thinking. Do you expect me to lie again in front of everyone this time? That I again would take industrial amounts of anxiolytics and go against myself? - Is that your price? - It's my only condition. Well, I'm like that and I always will be for the rest of my life. It must be very difficult for you to admit it, right? Admit to yourself that this is the truth. And you don't admit it because you are unable to accept the fact that it's not going to change. And you trying to buy me off is just pathetic! Do you really think that your shitty money can change anything? Nothing is ever going to change! And it will never change until you realize it's impossible! It's absolutely impossible! Good morning, young lady. I shouldn't tell you this, but I just got some news that I'm sure you'll love. Come in. I've news about the car Slava mentioned. It's a Chrysler... Voyager, dark red. Registration number ATA 696. And? Slava was not lying. There was a car like this. The cameras have caught it. And who is the owner? Antanas Simonis. Our priest? Yes. Gintas! Gintas! Hello, Commissioner. What's going on? We've the court order. Do you want to call a witness? Hello, Gintas. What do you need? Oh, the Lordship of him! What's up Julius? Have you ordered this parade at my house? And what did you want me to do? They came to my office with concrete evidence. What concrete evidence? Have a nice day, Gintas. The best way to fight Gintas is to not act like him. This is a bluff. You've no proof. And all this shit is going to end up splashing you. So take your gang of clowns and get the fuck out of my house. Commissar. You should be more careful with your words. You are a bastard. Honestly, nothing surprises me... that the phone... ended up in the sewer. I've seen the video and understand why. But most alarming... is that the phone of the murdered prosecutor... was dumped there right after his death. Who has ordered to look for the phone? It was an anonymous call. I think that the prosecutor had informed him. The prosecutor, that piece of bastard is against me. They are all against me. They even searched my house... How the hell did they track that number without you? - They didn't use the number to trace it. - Then how? I've no idea! It's impossible to trace a phone in the sewer, and besides, the phone was smashed. So what? Did they find it there by chance? No, but it could mean that someone saw you there. It's the only possible explanation. Saw me? We can try to trace the numbers that were nearby at that time. Don't try it, do it, dammit! Do it! How long, my son! God already has enough problems. Tell me, how is the family? I've seen that Agne has returned. Sometimes it seems like I don't know her at all. Maybe you don't want to, Gintas. Each generation has its own revolution. Don't bring that subject up to me now. It's the least I need. - Rasa has been here recently. - Really? Expected. Before elections she will fix the roof for you. Then she will make a speech during the mass. No, she came to tell me about you. She said that you are in trouble and you are acting strange. Strange? Did she tell you what we took out from Laimonas' stomach? A viper that long. In his stomach. Do you understand, Antanas? "Viper". There's something stinky here. First, they killed Laimonas, and now they are searching my house. They're trying to finish me off and the whole town knows it! All! Sorry, Gintas, but God can see... that you're acting paranoid. Who else could know? Who? You also know quite a bit, Antanas. What he has promised you? Get a hold of yourself, Gintas. Don't forget where you are! Slava... He has told us that he saw your car. A dark red Chrysler Voyager. There he received a box with a viper, which he then took to Laimonas on the day of his death. Why do you say that like you're accusing me of his murder? - I sold my car months ago. - I've checked. You sold it that same day. But it's still not registered. May God be with you, I've things to do. Keep your suspicions to yourself, Gintas. One more thing, the other day, some parishioner put… a ruble in the donation box. I guess it was for you. Get fucked! Arunas. I'm looking at the dark red Voyager. Yes, the same. He's now heading towards the roundabout. Yes, I'm after him. Run, send a squad ASAP! Understood? Shit! What the hell are you doing? Stop the red van! - The red van, damn it! - Calm down. Calm down, Commissioner Krasauskas. - Hands back, back! - Hey! What's going on? Internal affairs. You are detained. Are you hanging the corpse on me? Where is the connection? The weapon… with which prosecutor Laimonas was shot has been found in your house. Wait, wait… That gun, they gave it to me for my birthday. It's a very uncomfortable situation, Commissioner. You ignored the investigation. You didn't even started it. You buried the prosecutor as soon as possible... without any forensic analysis. What's more, you've threatened the mayoress with violence. Publicly. She has filed a complaint. You set up all that show at the search, while the murder weapon was in your house. What does that gun have to do with this?! They shot Laimonas when he was already dead. You've heard it yourself. Commissioner, you had the motive, which was recovered from the sewers. You were afraid that this can come to light, and it would hurt your political career. The evidence is circumstantial. What's your fucking problem, huh? You've nothing. That gun wasn't even used in the murder! Did the prosecutor knew about your love affair with his wife? Perhaps he even told you. The only thing I want to know... what happened between you and the prosecutor… - that you tortured him like that? - I've not fucking tortured anyone! And you know it perfectly! All this is just a fucking setup to get me out of the way! So, the affair was not the motive? Did the prosecutor had something else on you? A viper! A viper in the prosecutor's stomach! A witness claims that you were the last to see Father Antanas. I was chatting with him for the few minutes. And what did you talk about? About women. What else you can talk about with a priest? You are suspended, Commissioner. And you'll remain under arrest. The accusations against you no longer surprise me. The head was cut off starting from the back of the neck. The killer had to inject a large amount of adrenaline for the victim... he didn't lose consciousness during the beheading. The pain must have been unbearable. With all the tendons and muscles severed, his head was still somehow attached to body by the skin. Only later it fell off. What's going on? I already told you, he has lost his mind. You may be right, but Gintas didn't do it... Lock him up for three months until the elections are over. - You don't know Gintas. - Rasa! I know him very well! As good as you! I would understand if Laimonas found out, then Gintas panicked and killed him. But he's not a maniac. "Viper", "Moose"... Don't you get it? He threatened to kill me. Listen, I understand why you sent that video to Laimonas, but I still don't understand what else you want! With the scandal like this, he has no chances in the elections. Julius… I didn't sent any video. - Then who? - I don't know! When he attacked me, he howled that it was sent from my house. But you didn't sent it? I'm telling you that I didn't. Who else knew? About what? About us. What do you mean by that? About us. Rasa, about us. I don't like your thoughts, Julius. By God, Loreta! What happened? Good evening, Your Honor! Hello, Vilija. Listen, honey... I've a case on my hands and I need an information about a convict. Of course. Give me the details. Vytautas Venclova. ID number? I don't remember it right now. But similar in age to mine. Found him. - May 30, 1959. - Good. The photo is recent. It seems that he has an eye defect. He was sentenced in 1991 to life imprisonment. Yes… I would say that he's the person I am looking for. Let's see... Aha. Released. What? How is he "released"? Recently, this year. He was amnestied under article 78. I see… Anything else? No... For now, that's all. Thanks. Excuse me, your honor. We're done and we'd like to go. Wait, not yet. Write a court decision regarding Commissioner Krasauskas. Write that the court rejects the prosecutor's request for pretrial detention. On what basis? Lack of direct evidence. Good evening, dear viewers. As you know, yesterday afternoon Parliament approved... the declaration of independence… from the Soviet Union by 124 votes in favour, six abstentions and no votes against. Thus, Lithuania became the first republic to become independent from Moscow, in accordance with legal instruments recently approved. There is nothing in the kitchen. Check the bedroom. I've it. AGENT - ANTANAS - "MOOSE" Yours. Rasa. AGENT - LAIMONAS - "VIPER" Yours. Hello. Yes. Of course. - Order to wait. - Wait for what? Someone has seen our files. Shit. Who else could've seen them? Come on! Fast. Give it to me! Fuck! It's him. Hello. I'm looking for the hostess. I've an appointment with her. Come in. I… I'm so sorry. I've come at a wrong time. You came at a very good time, Comrade Venclova. You made contact with her and you agreed to pay for the stolen files, right? And you promised her money. A lot of money... What? I didn't... However, you decided to keep all that money… and take the files. You killed her and burned her apartment to hide the evidence. What are you talking about? You've committed the unforgivable and very cruel crime, Comrade Venclova. Take him out of here, quick! Come on come on! Go! - Give me a hand! - Antanas, burn the files! Come on, hurry up! There is no time to lose. Thanks. Hello. How are you? How did he…? Forensics says there are 300 bee stings, maybe more. Severe allergy. A liquid was used that irritates the bees. I don't know how long he was alive, but... they said that bees don't sting a dead person. Gintas. They are waiting for you in court. Commissioner, what do you about the decision to release you? Is it true that Judge Julius Petrikis signed it just before his death? What do you think about the latest events? Commissioner, are you still claiming that you are innocent? Will you continue to run for mayor despite everything? Commissioner, your voters want to know the truth! Commissioner! What's going on? How come no one has informed me? It's a prerogative of the court. Three corpses! The priest, the judge and the prosecutor! You could've appealed! With all due respect, Madam Mayor, This is not a matter for the municipality. In my city, an extremely dangerous criminal psychopath is released for no apparent reason, And you dare to tell me that he's none of my business? - Ms! - After finding the corpse of a judge in the heart of my city, and after all this unimaginable cruelty, You've the nerve to say it's none of my business? - You see... - Mr. Prosecutor, it's evident... you don't know our city. Nor the influence of the commissioner. When? This morning. Inside his car. A bee hive. They stung him to death. The drone. What? Nothing. We've identified some phone numbers. Of those who were near the sewer that evening. And? One of those numbers exactly matches the one from which the SMS with that video was sent. Looks like someone actually saw you. Okay, track it. We've been interviewing people... about the priest's Voyager. And three of them claim to have seen him that day near the cabin. What cabin? Gintas... I didn't do anything. I think that you'll want to investigate it on your own. Good morning... mom. What do you want? We need to talk. There was no need in many years... A certain person came to see you a week ago. Many people come to see me every week. He came in a red car. A dark red car. I no longer distinguish colors well. God knows what you can or can't see. He has got rid of Laimonas, and he has beheaded the priest. And he has killed Julius. I already know. Now he's coming for you. Leave her alone, Gintas. Mom, who came to see you? He took the biggest. - Motherfucker! - Cover it up! It warmed up, now it will be hungry. Why the fuck do you keep them? They're poisonous! Not much more than your wretched life, son. What did he tell you? What did he ask? I can only tell you that he knows you very, very well. So what? I've told him that you are cursed. And that your whole family is cursed. Don't bring my family into this. I may be blind, but the one who can't see is you! You no longer have a family, Commissioner... Who did this to you? Please, tell me who, Agne. Who? Torture is much nicer than being your daughter. I could take it again. No! Let me go! Help! Not! Go away! Someone help me please! No no no no! No Please. Please! No! …did he sign it just before his death? What do you think about the latest events? Commissioner, are you still claiming that you are innocent? What plans do you've, will you return to the police force? Will he still run for mayor despite everything? Do me a favor. Get out of here. Don't ask me anything, just get out of here! Where should I go? I don't care! Go to Loreta. She has plenty of room in her bed, just for you. Fuck it! Fuck you! Fuck you all! Fuck! A hard night? Don't ask me. Called a lady from the Department of Prisons. She said that Judge Julius Petrikis called her that same afternoon. He was asking about a convict, some Vytautas Venclova. Who? Repeat that to me! The judge was asking about Vytautas Venclova. But he's still in jail. Sentenced to life... No. He was released. Amnesty. We know that he bought the red Voyager from the priest. Section two is already finished, just need to check the 27%... Gintas, I ask you not to do anything you might regret. Venclova... What? Vytautas Venclova. Julius knew, but he found out too late. Can you give us a minute? I honestly thought that you had lost your mind. Thirty years have passed! Who would've suspected him? He has had time to think it over. The viper, the moose, the drone... It was a tip. It's he who recorded me and then sent the video from your house. He knew that I would track it. And that I would find it. My God... Only the two of us remain. But he doesn't know we've found out. Put security in your house. Act normal and he will come to you. - Are you serious? - Do you think you've another option? Do you want to confess to the press? There is no other way, Rasa. You are next. Either we get him, or he gets you. And then me. Hello. When? When?! Gintas! I've searched everywhere! I've called his friends... Take it easy. His phone is off, Gintas! Where did they see him last? At school. He left and no one has seen him again. We will comb the center from the park to the stadium, and from the stadium to the pond. Afterwards, we will go down the river until we return to the park. Benas wore a camouflage jacket and a gray hat. This is the suspect, Vytautas Venclova. About sixty years old, ex-convict. He has a very characteristic feature, a flaw in his right eye. He could be in a red Voyager. Minivan. Registration number ATA 696. Benas! Benas! Benas! Benas! Benas! Come! I've found something! God, it's from Benas. Gintas, it's Benas' backpack! There is a car parked near the mansion. A red Chrysler. - Registration ATA 696. - What's inside? I can't tell, but there is someone inside. Do you see a child? I can't tell, but it's very likely. Okay, don't scare him off. Don't lose sight of it. I'm coming right away. Gintas, I beg you! Tell me our son is still alive! Please! Tell me our Benas is alive! - I'm sure it's fine. - Swear to me… Quiet. Trust me. Arunas! Commissioner, we've closed the back roads. - And the car? - There. It's too dark to see it. We don't know if the boy is alone. Okay. If he starts to move, block the road! No! Bring the fire brigade to the mansion, now! Shit! Benas! No! Commissioner! There is no one here. How nobody? There is no trace of any body. Commissioner! Commissioner. They just called us. Your house is on fire. Stay here. I'll take care of it. Don't turn on the lights. Benas! Dad! I'm here! - Dad! Get me out of here! - Benas, it's me! Benas! I'm afraid! Benas! Dad! I'm in here! Dad! Dad! Help me! I'm here! Dad! Benas! Benas! This is a horrible and unfathomable attack on our community. It could be said that our citizens live in terror. Families must go to work... Take their children to school and right now they don't feel calm or safe. - Benas, sit here! - Okay. Commissioner. We've traced his phone. We've his location. Where is he? At the Town Hall. I want to emphasize that the suspect is extremely dangerous. Stay away from any suspicious person and report them to the authorities immediately. We believe that all the victims are linked... - Hello. - ...with the suspect's past... He is there with you. It's crowded here. Look around. He may have changed his appearance. Get Rasa out of there as quickly as possible. And where do we take her? To home? Anywhere but her home. At the railroad. Wait for me there. Okay. Listen. Take all units to the Town Hall. - As soon as possible. - Dad, let me go with you. You just sit here and don't take a single step. Not a single one! I would like to calm the citizens of our city, and encourage them to respond to the request from the police, regarding information about suspicious persons. Ladies and gentlemen, we must take a short break. We will continue shortly. - What happened? - You've to go. Arunas will pick you up, I'll take care of the journalists. Erikas, stay here. See you later. - Where? - Somewhere near the factory. Be carefully. Gintas. - Good afternoon. - Hello, Kestas. - You've to help me. - I'm busy right now. You see, it's been over a week since the body was brought in and no one has claimed it yet. What corpse? That one who hanged himself at the post. What do I do now with that one-eyed corpse? One-eyed? The one who hanged himself at the post. One of his eyes is punctured. Anything? We had lost it. But now the signal is coming from here. - Where is that? - At the railroad. Damn, we've lost the signal again. Fuck. Give me that number. - Is it yours? - No. It's not mine either. Then whose? Hello. Rasa? Gintas, it's me. How did you get this phone? I've found it in my pocket. What happened? It's not him... It's not Vytautas Venclova. What are you talking about? Venclova is dead. Stay where you are. Call off the search party. It's all a setup. Who is Vytautas Venclova? Venclova is dead. Now get me out of here. Gintas said that we should wait. What is this...? Get me out of here! Can't. We've to wait for Gintas. Drive or I'm getting out of the car! Calm down, Madam Mayor. I told you to drive! Erikas is here. I told him not to come! Help! Someone help me! Help! Help! Help! - Rasa! - Gintas! Help me! It's he! Who is he? Who? They could've done the same to me. Leave me in that apartment. After all, I saw the files and their faces. But they… they needed to put the blame on someone. So, that's how I was sentenced to life imprisonment. Commissioner! Just in time! How are you? Agent "Ruble"! Don't even think about it. No. What are you doing? I beg you… Please, no! Please don't do it, I beg you! Please please! Don't do it. Have mercy please! Calm down, Madam Mayor. Your voters will be delighted by your hot performance tonight.
