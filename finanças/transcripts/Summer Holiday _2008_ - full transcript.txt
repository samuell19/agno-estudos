Adi, come on. Come on, Adi. Come on! Daddy, daddy, can I have it? Let me get it going first. Here. And run along the shore to fly it. Go, go! Good, give it more string. That's it, Adi! Good job! Come here! Well done, Adi! Let me get it higher! Look how high it is! - Come here. You hold it. - Me, me too! Come, you hold it. Do you like the kite? Look how high it is! I prefer the castle! - You want the castle again? - Yes! OK, but this time let's build it right, please. - I want water. - OK, go get water. - But don't get wet. - OK. Don't get wet, Adi! Let me get the water. Wait there. I'm going with Daddy. Watch out. You make the cement, l'll dig the moat. But where do we put the cement? Mix the cement! Where do we put it? I don't know. We have to have a construction plan. We can'tjust build without one. Let's make the cement, so it provides support. Pour it here. No, wait! It's not ready! Let's see. - Wait! - Mr. Builder, I say it looks good. Don't pour yet! - Get the excavator out of the way. - Wait, not yet! That's enough... you don't want it too hard. No, it's good. I saw it's good. OK, have it your way. Start digging. You wanted the castle. - I'm making a little window. - Forget it. Get the shovel. - I made a little window here. - Out of shells. But now let's dig the ditch. You kept nagging me about the castle. Windows with shells here, ok? I made a little hole for the shell. Put the shell there, then. I put a big shell here. And this is a secret entrance. - So where's the secret exit? - Here. l'll tap it hard! Not so hard, you'll ruin it. I want to ruin it. Adi, please... Why don't you play alone in the sand? He's got no patience. I wonder who he takes after. No interest in anything. He's exhausted. What do you expect? He was up early... Mrs. Doina called. I waved but you didn't see me. Why didn't you answer? What does she want? Adi, the sand is wet. Don't go near the water. Don't worry, he won't. Come here. - Cold? - Yes. - Sweaty? - Yeah. No you're not. - Go build in the sand. - He has sand all over. It's OK, we'll shake it off later. Pity I didn't get the camera from our room. Ordid I leave it in the car'? No, you brought it. Are you all right? - Who, me? - You seem upset. Why didn't you bring a book along? I'm fine. I'm OK, really. You're OK with us guys? It's almost two o'clock... Hi. You called. I sent you the stuff for items two and four. No, sorry, two and five. With penalties. They're bored at home... Couldn't leave us alone on holiday. It's the standard clause, except I added a four-day margin. That's if they want the finishings. Adi, please don't go in! Madam, I'll call you back. I thought we had a deal. Get the bucket, please. - I made room for you. - Watch this, he's going in. He doesn't have the guts to go in. The waters very cold. Let's see, baby... He went in. You'll have to move closer. He's so cute with his little shovel. Yes, he is... - Adi, who's this? - I don't know. Adi, stop running around so much. Don't you want to talk to your sister? Wanna talk into the microphone? Want to sing to her 'In the walnut forest'? Yes. Should I go in too? I'm going in. I'll get really upset. You're crazy. Big deal. It's my pleasure. No 1st of May without a dip in the sea. Have it your way. Good, baby! - Are you going for a swim? - Yes, kiddo. - And Mama's very upset with him. - Why? But she's gonna watch me go in. It's very cold, that's why. Daddy's not allowed to. It's very cold. Where's Daddy going? He's going... I could tell you just where... Here, eat some banana. - That was so good! - Did you swim, Daddy? Adi, let's collect our toys, ok? Help Mama. - Are you annoyed? - Yes, I'm annoyed. - What are you so upset about? - Let me go. You're wet and cold. - Let's go. - I'm ready. Get dressed, shake off the sand, fold the towel... You're ready... Sorry, I had to watch my kid. So, please put everything together, close the contract and let's e-mail it. And cc me, too. Actually, don't cc me. I don't have my laptop here anyway. Monday night. Got it. Bogdan, really, can't you take care of him too? Well, happy Labor Day. Well, talk on Tuesday. Thanks, bye, bye. - What's wrong? - Ijust brushed the sand off him. Look at him... Turn around. Want to get smacked? Go on, help your mother. What about the kite? Got a bag? I've got snots! Got a snotty nose? Come here. Two million, sir. Drive safely! Just don't run this lady over. If you don't drive safely, the police will suspend your license. The Polish gins used to come here to sell creams and stuff. There was a stampede when they did. Yes, I can picture your mother there. It was great. The chicks sunbathed nude, and I was watching. It's all gone to the dogs. People have stopped coming. I was talking to lulia on Tuesday. She said they're going to Varna. Forget lulia. Bulgaria, Romania, same shit. Well, they were supposed to come to Neptun as well. I'm glad they didn't. Let them go to Varna. If they went to Turkey or something, I'd understand. Then people complain the Romanian coast sucks. What's wrong with them? I get along great with lulia. I think they're both annoying. I mean they're boring. Motorcycle! Yes, baby. Let's see it up close. It's red. Like it? Horseback ride! - Again? - Yes. Two rounds. That's it. Boogie? Penescu! What's up with you, man? How are you doing? You've gone to the ground! No I haven't. Great to see you! I went out for cigarettes. At the Fishery they only have Pafliament. - Your kid? - Yeah. Adi. Lordache was calling you till he got blue in the face. - Why don't you answer? - The Swede? That asshole is here? Yeah man. He is. Smaranda is here, too. Hi Smaranda! We came to Neptun for Spring Break. Imagine, no wet ones! Neptun has gone to the dogs. - Tell me about Iordache. - Wait. Iordache, man, here's a nice surprise. I'm here talking with Boogie. Yup, Mr. Ciocazanu is here with Smaranda and a little Ciocazanu on his back. Hold on. He wants to talk to you. Hallo? Me too, you four-eyed Swede. Is that what you wanted to tell me? I left lordache at the Fishery and came here for smokes. Well, what can I do? I didn't recognize the number. Let me talkto him. If I'd seen the area code for Sweden I'd have answered. - He says we should meet up tonight. - We should. - You'll be around, right? - Yes. The question is, where? What do you think, lordache? Won't you come to the Fishery now? We were heading back to our room. But we can meet later. - They're having a family afternoon. - Later tonight. Eight, then? At the Amphitheatre? He says OK. - On the terrace, not inside. - We'll find you. - Yeah, man, lights. - You're a freakin' nag. Boogie's right, you're a nag. OK then. You should see how fat he got... - You know Iordache. - Of course. So then, I'll go get the cigarettes. We'll all meet tonight. - Man, I'm glad I ran into you. - Bye! Bless you! So, lordache is back. Guess it didn't work out for him there. You don't know that for sure. I think he's just back visiting his folks. Wait. He called and I didn't answer, he says. Told him, you should have called from your Swedish number. He says he used Penescu's phone to save money. What a cheap skate. It might rain tonight if were on the terrace. Hello. Wait. I've gone out onto the balcony. Adrian's sleeping. Yes, the poor baby. He fell asleep as soon as we got back to our room. Sunny but cold. You're right, we have to wear sweaters rather than T-shirts. I'll tell him. Yes, call when he wakes up. Yes, I'll give him a kiss. Thanks. Bye now. My mother? I thought you called her today. Don't let her unload on me. I don't enjoy it. Why, did she say anything bad? No. But you could have called her. You know how she gets worried. L'll lie down for ten minutes. I hope Adrian doesn't wake up. I checked the fittings. The nightstands, the bed. They're holding alright. What do you expect? It's only been two months. We should have done the doors, too. They wouldn't listen to me. L'll nap for ten minutes. Tonight were putting him to bed in the other room. - Look, a boat! - Where? The white one? What are the colored ones? Those are pedal boats. - With pedals? - Yes. They float. You pedal through the water. - Look. - Yes, a ship. Far, far away. Want something to play with? Now we'll eat, with two of Daddy's friends. And you'll be good, right? No tantrums. We eat, then it's bedtime. He)'- I didn't recognize you from behind, with the child and all. You've changed, too. Filled out a bit. I haven't seen you since the wedding, in 2002. - Where's Boogie? - Coming now. I should smack your thick neck, you phone filtering bastard. - When did you get here? - Yesterday afternoon. - How come we didn't meet before? - We're meeting now. Sit down. Lovely kid. - What's your name? - Tell him. Adi. Can we get a dry Murfatlar and two half waters. - Two bottles. - And ice, please. How old is he? - Tell him how old you are. - I'm four. He'll be four in June. - You? - What about me? Aren't you going to make a little Swede of your own? Lordache called you a billion times... You deleted my number, or what? Maybe you changed your number. I don't answer if I don't recognize it. Man, you're getting bald. That's fine. You've got some grey hairs. - Still in the furniture business? - We've expanded since. Maybe we can do something together and smoke lkea. Talk to the lady here. She's the Development department. I see. - I even called you from the agency. - What agency? - The travel agency where I W0l1( now. - What's it called? Geroma Tour. We'll pour. Can I take your order? I don't feel like eating. You? We've ordered. Something traditional? Sarmale? - What's the carp marinated in brine like? - It's carp. Marinated in brine. I mean, is the fish fresh or frozen? Frozen. Never mind, then. Want something? - Nothing. - Nothing, then. I don't like him playing near the railing. How long have you been with Geroma? I haven't heard of them. I hadn't, either, until I got a job with them. - Big company, then. - Huge. Where did we buy our tickets for Antalya? You're going to Antalya? This summer. Tul1 - I want to go to Hong-Kong. - Alone, or with Inge? You don't take your wife to Hong-Kong. - So you got yourself a wife... - Who, this guy? I meant wife as in stable girlfriend. So, how about I sell you a six-day trip to Hong-Kong? If Smaranda lets us. Bogdan, bring him here to eat, please. Greece is better in summer. Really? - C'mon Adi, let's eat. - I want bread. - Don't you want soup? - I want bread. Hotel Amphitheatre. We used to stay there on the corner. Isn't that where the Hun fell off'? No. It was Hotel Terra. Radulescu's girl, Mirela, had set us up there. - That's right, in... '92 - That Mirela. Her father was some big cheese in the Ministry of Transportation. You don't know the Hun. In the 12th grade, this guy fell off the balcony. He got wasted and fell right off from the second floor. We thought we were fucked. Excuse me... But he went like this. - And went back over the railing. - Is he Hungarian? His mother was from Turda. With him sprawled over, we thought he was dead. - Oh, it was here at the Amphitheatre. - No it wasn't. Your husband got mad at Radulescu and Baciu for pushing him over. Well, they did. Get real. Radulescu wasn't even in the room. - You beat the hell out of Baciu. - That's nonsense. Smaranda should know who she's dealing with. Ciocazanu had one hell of a jab. Well, let's see how this soup is. - Cold. - You've calmed down. Back then you'd have trashed the waitress for bringing you cold soup. - He had a short fuse back then. - Smaranda, don't believe them. You know how I always address a waitress as 'distinguished lady'. Cheers now, and here's to us getting together. - I'm having water. - That's fine. He's been doing that all the way here in the car. - Fuck you! You had garlic burgers! - My gall's been troubling me. You stuffed yourself with hot dogs and mashed potatoes. - What? - Hotdogs and mashed potatoes. Back in Sweden I carried the idiot around, showed him the fine stuff. All he could think about was hot dogs. Asshole. You do that back there, too? I do. So send me some Tums for my birthday. Guess what my aunt in Germany's been asking me to send her'? - Fluocinolon. - What's that? Some cream, I don't know. Last time she was here she scoured the drug stores for it. She dragged my mother along. She'd bought 15 tubes. The Germans didn't have any, she said. Switch to still water, please. I'm having you sleep on the balcony tonight. You can come sleep in my kids bed, he farts too. How about starting some business with this Fluocinolon stuff? For the Romanian community abroad. Fluocinolon for all Romanians! Guys, sorry to interrupt. Bogdan, the kid's getting sleepy. Penescu's saying we should start a business with Fluocinolon. - He should see your aunt about it. - Told you. Adrian has to be put to bed. OK then, I'm going to stay a bit longerwith the guys. Then I'm going to put him to bed. So, you're staying? Don't lock the door, I'll be there. Soon. Kiss Daddy good-night. - Bye now, have fun. - Bye, Smaranda. Bogdan, bring me the keys, please. Thanks for bringing me to the seaside to babysit the kid. Come on... I won't be long. That's all I had to say. Bye now. Is she upset cause you're staying on with us? Of course not, she knows better... - So you've quit. - It's been three months now. Congrats. What do you know... Since Smaranda got pregnant again. She can't stand the smoke. - Kid number two? You're good! - And we'll stop there. Not even to go with a drink? No, man. I said I'd quit, I quit. And what's it going to be? Too soon to tell. Smaranda would like a girl. - I wouldn't have pictured you like this. - That's life, man. Diana used to nag me about it too. I had to quit smoking for a week or so. - That chick was crazy. - I'd say she was all right. Have you kept in touch with her? No. Penescu says she got married. Her sister told me. I ran into her, she talked me out of my head. I'm kind of thinking of calling her. - Who? - Diana. Good. Take her out for a coffee, give her that killer smile and... Don't be sad. Watch her on Boogies wedding tape. You could jerk off thinking of her. - I have her on the DVD, man. - Blow me. He's taken it to heart, the dumb ass... Blow me. You know I'm sensitive, morons. Why don't you show Boogie the condoms you carry around, for no reason. Hold on now, don't be stupid. Are you collecting them, or what?! - You lame dick. - Shove it. You never know. The levy broke. - Pour it all. We'll get another one. - You're sure? We could go somewhere else. As you wish. Let's go bowling, to Olimp, like we used to. They shut the place down three years ago. - You're shitting me. How come? - Nobody went there anymore. Maybe she's seen you, but thinks you've got a nose bleed. - Is it still open in Neptun? - What? - The bowling alley. - Yeah, I went by the other night. Excuse me? The bill, please. That's it. So you got yourself a big family car. It's cool. lt's a Saab, right? I like you, you have a Swedish car. It's perfect for Romania. It's great on potholes. You had problems with that Megane? No shit. 1,000 euro for 1,000 km. Never buy a French car. Still, it's a heap of cash. The Megane's a kind of a Logan made in Tumey. From the back it looks like a fridge. - What? - The Logan. Right. Looks like an iron. - So you're staying here? - Yeah. Nice. Look, they've even got stuff for kids. We got a room at hotel Decebal. They both belong to some guy. We were hoping to furnish them both. - Did the guy change his mind? - I did. Fucking scrooge. What do you know... Nice, leather upholstery. How much was it? - Taxes included? - Never mind, you'll just make me sick. 30,000 plus taxes. I see. 'Young man, I wouldn't do that if I were you!' Shit! I completely forgot about that stupid chemistry teacher! - Come on. She's dead now. - He's still got issues with her. Fuck the bitch! She flunked me yearafler year. - You were such a moron! - Yeah, right. She was fishing for private classes, and I didn't take any. Should I play something to cheer you up? Wait, these are my wife's. OK, quiet now. Nobody sleeps tonight, We'll drink till daylight. Let the waiters pour the wine, You hold a woman and feel divine. We'll ask our wives to look away, If they see us, they won't say. 'D'stands for down the drink, 'R' stands for rest, But don't rest too long, this pal1y's the best. Nobody sleeps tonight, We'll all sleep in our graves. Wife, don't nag and pester me, better have a drink with me. lordache, you used the girly pink one? Yeah, man, I have thin fingers. Boogie, come here... - Cheers! - In the eyes. Man, aren't you done with that crap? 7 years jerking off if you don't look us in the eye. So, Boogie... You don't smoke anymore, you barely drink. Do you at least get laid? - Ijust drank, didn't I? - He gets laid. You saw the kid. I did, but he doesn't look like Boogie. Maybe the next one. Well, I'm always with the carpenters, with furniture and stuff... The next one will look like Pinocchio. OK, good work Gepetlo! - Is that better? - Throw the damn ball, we're wasting time. Yes, Mama, what's wrong? Fine. Thanks. Yeah, I swam to Turkey and back. No, I'm not in my room now. I'm with some friends. Come on, Mama, what is this? What? I told you he's got a couple already. It's your money, whatever. But he's a big boy, He's already toilet-trained. I'll be there later. Okay, I'll tell her. Why don't you call heryourself? Bye. Wasn't it your shot? Why are we wasting time? - Go, champ! - There he goes again. - Your mother? - Yeah. - How is she? - Nagging, as always. - Still wouking? - Babysitting. Mostly. There, you've got me angry now. You're too famous and talented, we can't get in your way. Yeah, lordache, we're so stupid, why notjust play instead of us. - Loser pays for the wine. - I've already paid for this one. I mean, from now on. Can't I just buy us another round so you can spare us? - You just go get your pink ball. - Kiss the pinky... Change his score. No more pussies? - What pussies? - On the label. They had a cat. No, man, now it's black. Drink, man. Forget about pussies. Drink, man! I spilled it on myself. Go ahead and laugh. We'll get hard-ons again. Manl... Where do they find them? No idea. They were here last night. Penescu wanted to hit on the brunette. - Which one? - She's coming over now. Roxana. Penescu, are you in love? Wave to her, maybe she'll swing by here. Want me to hook you up? May I impose upon you forjusta minute? Impose upon us as long as you like, Roxana. I didn't expect to see you guys. Were you bowling? I wanted to, but these two are cramping my style. - Would you like to play with me? - What if I beat you and you get angry? I won't get angry. Look, if you beat me, I'll marry you. - And ifl lose? - Then I'll marry you. I'm not with these losers, you know. - Hi, I'm Roxana. - Pleased to meet you. - How pleased are you? - Shut up, you'll scare her. Relax, I'm used to it. They've embarrassed themselves last night? They're nice guys. Them? You couldn't be more wrong. What do you mean? Then why do you hang out with them? I told you, I'm not with them. I was just passing by, I heard them talking about you, so I stopped by their table. He's just drinking off tables. What were they saying? All good, I hope. Very good. Won't you sit down? So... you've been bad mouthing me. - Who, us? - You think we are such bastards? He said so. Watch out for this guy, he's dangerous. Is that true? They're just jealous because I'm young and handsome. That's right, Roxana, how old do you think we are? You're thirly-something, you two. - And him? - He's about 25. 27 tops. Wrong! Just say he's smarter, too, and I'll call it a night. - Fucking teenager... - You heard Roxana. It's not my fault I'm so good-looking! - Listen. Do you wear glasses? - No. Penescu, get your cane and let's go, we've got a mud-wrap treatment tomorrow. Mud, schmud, you drunkards. Can't you see we're past it? Let's go! There, you've ruined our evening. That can't be. Here. To wash away your sorrows. She gave us lights. Now she's calling us fat. Don't I get anything? No, since you didn't want to tell me your name. Here, fill this in. - What's this? - It's a fonn. You become a member of the Effect Team if you fill this in. Wonderful! And you can win prizes. He doesn't need them. He's already a champ. - I can't, I don't have a pen. - Here. She even has a pen. Just a moment, I'll be right over. Leaving us alone again? I have to. I still have a lot of W0l1( to do today. Are you going to Vama? No, we came from there. We're going to Mamaia. Where? We've got 'La Mania' and 'Scandinavia', I think. We're coming, too. Yeah? Are you taking him with you? Definitely. I thought he wasn't with you. - We're not bringing him along. - She really had you there, man. She had me, but I enjoyed it... You forgot to write your mobile number. You got yourself a mobile? Is that the rule now? Tell us what it says under 'Marital status'. Can't tell you, it's confidential. Here. Now you have to give me your phone number in return. That was to see if you were being straight with me. - Hey, she didn't do that with us. - That's 'cause you're both good guys. This is for you. - What is it? - A keychain! It's so pretty! Does it sing? Can I touch it? It looks golden! I'll see you in Mamaia then. But bring Bogdan along, too. - Yes, ma'am. - Bye now. I foresee problems. Boogie, please don't hook me up again. I'm getting another bottie to recover. This was for you, sucker! I'll give you the keychain. What did she say in your ear? Fuck, you got balls... What can I say, I'm hot... You think it's easy to be adored? - Fucking Adonis! - I love it when you envy me. Penescu, take a photo of me and Ciocazanu, he's so famous. I've been famous all my life, only no one knew it. Take this bottle away, you can't see my belly. Two ugly motherfuckers. Just take the picture. Say 'cheese'! Cuuunt! Let me see. You really are ugly, Four Eyes. - You're too handsome for me. - I'm special. He can't take a decent photo, man. He cut our heads off. With those square mugs of yours... Here! Hold it, it's not yours. This is a lovely wine, with a pleasant kick, fruity and harmonious. Little Roxana text him. Does she say she loves you? Roxana's over there, you asshole. Yeah. Roxana! Let's drink! To us. 'Cause we're jolly good fellows! I'd like to take you to a dance club. I'm going home. What's with you? Are you drunk? He's going to Mamaia with Roxana, ltell you. - Bull. I said I was going to sleep, didn't I? - No one goes to sleep! You tell us where you want to go, or else I'll get depressed. And then you'll have to blow me. I tell you. Let's get ourselves a piece of ass. Here is a bright idea! Home. Boogie, I'll get depressed. The asshole is actually leaving. Give him a head start. l'll tackle him right away. No, really, I told Smaranda I'd be there. Man, are you nuts? We get to meet once and you're taking off? Come on! It's really early. Let's eat. I didn't have anything to eat. - Let's go to Vama. - Shut up! At least let's finish the wine. I'll see you tomorrow. Really, I'm kind of tired. Problems at home? Where the fuck are you going? Sit down! - Stay there, you drunkard! - I'm tackling you, fuckface. Easy, easy, man, or I'll break your glasses. I kicked yourass in bowling, you haven't drink and now you're taking off? We can't do business with this clown. Come, come. Let me kiss your pretty fuck-face. - Fucking piss-eyes... - Bye, jerk-off. Take care of this asshole. We'll talk on the phone. If you answer... Fuck. Are you sleeping? Smaranda... Speak louder, won't you. Wake him up. And thump around louder. Please turn off the light. Or do you want me to go? I'll go. Turn on the table lamp. I'm not turning on the lamp. It's too bright. What was that? I didn't hear you. Would you keep it down? I had a hard time putting Adi to sleep. - Please, turn on the lamp. - I told you, it's too bright. I hate coming back to a dark room. We've had this conversation. I come home and can't get to the bed because you've turned off the lights. Then come home earlier. Now really, Smaranda. Put the t-shirt in the bathroom. It stinks of cigarettes. I come back and find the lights out, I just want to walk out again. Do as you please. I didn't get that. What was that? I didn't get that. Bogdan, what's with you tonight? What do you want from me? What's your problem? You're text-messaging me like a freakin' wife And when I come home I find you in the dark. You want me to turn on the headlights, or what? I told you I'd stay a bit longer. I told you I'd come. I came. I didn't call you. No, you just wrote: 'I'm going to sleep, good night'. That's right, so I went to sleep. You went to bed in a bad mood, is what you did. That's because you come and thump around and disturb us. Adi's fine. He's fast asleep. Like you know anything about how he sleeps. You come home at 11, 12 every night, find him asleep. So you know how he sleeps... Smaranda. I'm talking about now. You've been giving me the looks all night, huffing and puffing. I haven't seen the boys in three years. Excellent. Now turn off that light, please. If you wanted to be with them, you should have told me. I'd have stayed home with Adrian. How was I to know I'd run into them? I haven't seen them in three years. It really gets to me when you're a hypocrite. Why am I a hypocrite? - For not admitting. - Admitting to what? That you enjoyed meeting them. And that, if you could, you'd still be with them now. Yes, Smaranda. I enjoyed it. I'm glad. They're a wonderful pair. Especially Penescu, with those boiled-fish eyes of his. Just say you don't like them, then. You're being a hypocrite. You smiled and seemed friendly at the terrace. What did you want me to do? Be rude? Just act the way you feel, since you're not a hypocrite. It's your business, they're your friends. I don't like them. Just so you know. Why not? There's nothing to like there. Lordache hasn't called you in three years. Nothing to like there. Bogdan, turn off the lamp. What's with you? Let's see what happens if I don't. Are you drunk? Since when do you act like that with me? Right. Now give me crap fordrinking. Wife! You judge them without knowing them. You saw them three times and bam, you've got an opinion. I saw them more than I'd have cared to. Losers, both of them. Very well. You go out with them, have fun, and leave me alone. Boogie... Look how you're acting. How am I acting? I meet Vali and Sorin, I'm having a good time, I tell you I'd be a bit late. I drink a bottle of wine and hurry home. And find you here sleeping, but all wound up. Where did you think I was? We went bowling in Neptun. - Can you keep it down? - I talk any way I please. So now you're keeping tabs on me when I go out for a drink with the guys. I told you what I think of your guys. You told me, and I'm ignoring it. You'll let me do that, yeah? Bogdan, let's get this straight: I don't care where you went with the boys. Bowling, drinking - I don't care. What I care about is, if you go someplace with me, then you stay with me and the kid. What I care about is that you don't text me to come home and then I find you sleeping. What I care about is that you wanted us to take Adrian along, so I'd end up alone taking care of him while you have your fun. I'll tell you what I care about. What I care about is that you let me relax a bit and stop getting at me. I W0l1( like crazy all year round to pay for the house and the car. So with us you don't get any breaks. Us? Why do you keep using the child? I didn't text you to come. No, you wrote 'I'm going to sleep, good night'. Meaning, I'm here alone waiting for you, you go ahead and have fun. No, Bogdan, I wrote you that Adi had fallen asleep and that if you'll stay longer, I'll go to sleep. In other words, 'you enjoy yourself, I'll be here suffering'. 'Good night'. I didn't write 'good night'. Forget the damn phone. L'll prove it to you. I wrote: 'I had a hard time putting Adrian to sleep.' 'You can stay late, I'm going to sleep.' You know he didn't sleep this afternoon. 'Good night'. Stop pushing that in my face. So what if I wrote it? I wished you a good night. 'I had a hard time putting him to sleep. If you're late, I'm going to sleep.' 'Good night.' If I'm late, you're going to sleep. That is, if I'm not late, you're not going to sleep. Smaranda, are you listening? - Have you gone crazy? Shut the door. - Forget the fucking door. - Bogdan, keep your voice down. - Forget the door. So I came home. - I left the guys and came home. - Get out of the bathroom. I came home and find the lights turned off. You're exhausted! Had a hard time putting Adi to bed. You made such a great effort! Yes, Bogdan, I made an effort which you're not making much. You don't help and just leave me to manage. So just let me take care of things. What effort are we talking about? I'm saying you see this child in bed early in the morning and late at night, while he's asleep. Give me a break! No, you've made me say it, so I did. You don't spend enough time with him. You're always late in the workshop, probablyjust playing computer games. I W0l1( there! I'm not playing. And when you finally have time to spend with him, you go bar-hopping with Iordache and Penescu. Move away. That's what you think I do, then. It's not what I think, it's what you do. Very well. If that's what you like, go ahead and do it. I'm not stopping you. That's what I said: 'You can stay out. I'm going to sleep.' Very well, Smaranda. So now I'm a drunkard. I didn't say that. Aren't you ashamed, calling me a drunkard, making accusations. Ever since Adrian was born I've been begging you to come to work and help me out? You complain about spending time with the child. I said: 'Let's get a babysitter!' 'No, it's important that I stay home and take care of him.' OK, stay home, take care of him. Then let me work and have my fun, too. And what do you do? Stay at home and go sour. And I'll go completely sour if you continue to ignore me. I will ignore you, 'cause I don't like you - the way you are. How can I like you - like that? - You're acting like a wife. - Stop calling me 'wife'! - That's what you are. - Leave me alone. Stop calling me wife. You made me a wife! You gave me a child that you're messing up now. - Sure, now I'm a bad father. - Stop pestering me. You're a wonderful father. Go on, go out with the boys. Cry now, why don't you? Go away, let me sleep. Fine. If you're going to sleep, I go back to drinking and you have your peace. Go ahead. I'm not keeping you. Wouldn't that be something? What did you say? I'll turn off the light now so you can sleep. All right? Carry on sleeping. I'm going to have some more fun. Good night. Or how did that go? What will it be? Coffee. Espresso. Large or small? - Filter? - No. Large, then. I'll bring some milk. Hey! Yeah, you clown, I woke up. Where are you? Better meet me outside... What's he saying? Don't put him on. What's he saying? The music's too loud, I can't hear you. Get out of there. Where to the right? Yeah, I know it. OK, I'll see you there. Right away. Bye. - I'll just go in a bit. - 10 lei. I thought you might let me in just to find someone. - OK, two minutes. - Thanks. Let the fun begin! Where's that other moron? Some dancer... Are we going? Lets! - What's that? - What? What's with these people? Look at that one. Is she a whore or is she with the fat guy? Look at the fat guy, just sitting there. If I give her 200 Euro, reckon shell dance with me? What? If I give her 200, do I get her? Try it out. Just kidding... What? Nothing. Disco. Enough. I'm done with this place. I'm getting hungry. - Shawarma, mistah? - I'm in! - I'll tell him. - Go tell him. He wants to hook up. - Isn't he coming? - He's staying behind to get a girl. Let's go outside. It's good here. At least it's quiet. Don't tell me you're falling asleep. I'm tired, man. Iworked hard these past couple of weeks. What do they see in those places? Dance clubs, I mean. Were those whores, or girls with their boyfriends? Whores with their boyfriends. You had a fight with Smaranda? I'm boiling. What happened? I like the two of you very much. You're good together. You've got mayo on yourjacket. Give me a napkin. We should have gone to that terrace, had some wine. Crappy shawarma. Tastes like pig shit. So tell me, now you just do design, or do you still work the floor? What floor? Do you still do manual work in your shop? Yeah, I do. Can't help it. If you're not watching them, they mess it up. Right... I don't have a big workload, but I have to do things right. It's hard to find good people, too. All the good people go abroad. You take them in from scratch, teach them the craft, and first chance they get, they go abroad. I'd rather stay here than go abroad to wash dishes, like Iordache. You're shitting me. Didn't he say he was a manager? Manager indeed, but in his spare time they let him mop the floor. That bad? What can I say, that woman of his fixed him up. He's wol1(ing illegally. - Big love, then. - Great... Until he gets his work permit. Then we'll see how he treats her. Call him, see what he's doing. No signal. This Swedish girl, is she hot, at least? Kind of old. But she's still holding her own. She wanted to hook me up with a neighbor of hers. What's with those chicks, man? Don't they get laid back there? - And? - What? The girl she wanted to hook you up with. This big, like a whale. So what? A fat one today, a thin one tomorrow. Anything but fat chicks. Put her on a diet. I wanted to ask you. You got someone good in sales? Smaranda was in charge, but now, with the child... - Children. - Yeah, children... Got anyone in mind? I'm asking because I'm thinking of changing jobs. Why, tourism not doing so well? You can't sell Turkey and Greece for triple the price anymore. I thought I'd go to Turkey this summer. Listen... On the other hand, I have a lot of work. It's hard to find the time. It's good that you're busy... No really, I work like a dog. At fifty I'll be a nervous wreck. My son will spoon-feed me mashed vegetables. Fuck man, count your blessings. At least you're making money. When you're a vegetable, you can hire a nice nurse to take care of you. She'll give your cock a nice bath. My cuckoo, like my son says. I thought I could get you involved in a business. What business? You said you made furniture for the hotel people. - Crap. - What? Wasn't that OK? - Cocksuckers. - Yeah? When there was W0l1( to be done they never gave me any peace. When I was done, they were like, sorry, no money, next week... Why do you think they let me stay there for free? They still owe a lot? Some. At least I got to pay my guys. But my profit... Nothing. So... So I take it you don't want me to make you rich. Capital R, man. Look, Four Eyes has picked something up. Guys, this is Ramona. She's coming to the hotel with us. I told her you were nice boys. - Hi Ramona. - Hi. - Here, let me see. - What? - Is this the fashion now? - Yeah, didn't you know? I had no idea. Look, Boogie. Small flowers. - Do you like it? - Awesome! - Got the same on your toenails? - Nope. Just the hands. Very pretty- So, are we going? We're going. Come, girls... - Got a smoke? - I don't smoke. - OK, friends already? - Yeah. - Got a cigarette? - Of course. - Here. - Thanks. They repainted the place. I had no idea. I'm very glad you like it. How much wine have we got left from last night? Don't think there's any, but check by the bed. No go. I'm going downstairs for more, if they're still open. - If not, go to the Dacia bar. - Sure thing. I'm leaving you here with the boys. Make yourself comfortable. - I'll be fine, thanks. - Four Eyes, is this yours? Yeah, I know... Let me be. "Harry Potter uhalverdunsprens..." - A soft drink? - Sure, if you've got one. If I hadn't, I wouldn't offer. Coke, Fanta? Fanta, please. Thanks. It's cold. It's May 1st. And I'm drinking cold stuff. I'll be a mess by tomorrow. You'll have to take care. So, all three of you stay in this room? Just two. You two? I'm just a guest. I'm a guest, too. That's right! Would you like a foot massage, or something? If you want, yes please. Actually, I'd rather not. - No? - No. Fine. l'lljust go to the bathroom then. Perfect. Terribly refined... Harry Potter... Did lordache say how much the fun costs? - 700 for all three. - It's doable. - I only have about 150, I think. - Don't worry. - You buying the fuck? - I'll take care of it. As for that thing, see what you can do. With the company, if you need any help. Told you, it depends on the workload. I may take on some more people, but in production, rather. - But I'll think about it. - Think about it. I'm fine, no problem, ljust wanted a change. I'm bored, to be honest. 10 years in tourism is enough. I want to do something else. I understand. It's very important to do something you like. There's no challenge in it anymore. They'll be falling apart within a year. You think? They look new. Made with two left hands. Look at the fittings. If you put strain on them they'll break. I'm curious about the drawers. Check this out. - They're bent or what? - Look. All warped in the middle. See here? I couldn't make mine that lopsided if I tried. Dig in first, mate? - You think? - Dick in! Don't keep me long. It's cold outside. In Seoul. Ready? Did you really have to put perfume on? Buy me a better one if you don't like it. It's not about liking it. I don't want to smell of perfume. So what do we do? I'll go take a shower. Go on then. - What's up? - That's it. All done. Explain. She was wearing a can of perfume. I don't want any trouble because of it. Really. Smaranda can smell anything. She's something else. Big deal, get her to take a shower. Fuck it. I told you, I don't want a disease anyway. Fuck. You've gone all soft, Boogie! I'll go. - She's in the shower. - Better still. - Where's the girl? - Make way. - Me first! - Step aside. Fuck off, or I'll slap you with my hard dick. - Me now. Fuck off, bozo. - I'll break your stick, Harry! The wine, Four Eyes. It's cold. Give us the wine. And the opener. And you can suck my dick... Now we take an hour's break, children. I called him, when? Last year on his birthday. - In September. - Exactly. What's up, you know, all that. He was working. And less than two weeks later, Penescu calls and tells me. He was a good guy. He was... You never know when it's your time to go. Truth is, he drove like a nutcase. And he was exhausted... You work like crazy and don't get to live. Why the fuck did you buy this crap? Let me kiss you. Man, you're my best friend... - And the biggest asshole. - I know. Let me kiss you again. We should talk more often, dickhead. You didn't stay in touch. I haven't got time for anyihing. Right, ain't got time for all the bozos... Suck my dick. I'll suck whatever you want. Listen. I don't like it much there. Fuck their fucking cold and ABBA and all. I don't like it. I don't feel right. Got it. You don't like it there. What have you got? - You hate their fucking ABBA. - Right. Roxetle, too. OK, Roxette too. Stop kissing me, you disgusting prick! I want the bottle, I don't want to fuck you. Handsome! - Want some more? - Nah, I'm good. I think I'll get married, too. Really? To Ines. - Inga. - Inga. You said you didn't like her. I like her. You're so stupid... Then marry her, man. I will. - Maybe you can come too, you know. - Sure thing. Do you work with Inga? Yeah, why? Just asking. You can't make it on your own there. Everybody looks at you like you're a piece of shit. It's hard. Don't you want to come back? To do what? You were saying something about a car repair shop. What car repair'? With what money? Will you finance me? Well, some money from Sweden, some from a loan... What loan? How will I pay it back? Ciocazan, you think everybody grew up in a fancy neighborhood? What's that got to do with it? My folks didn't even have enough to send me to college. It's easy to talk when you've had a fucking car since you were 18. What's that got to do with it? I was talking about now. Forget it. God help us, he's done. - Let's see... - Don't go in, man. It's freezing out here. Go in where? I wanted to get out. - Wasted already? - Fucked. Fuck, it's enough to make you dizzy, coming from outside. Smells like cunt and Bulgarian perfume. Don't shut the door man. Let the stink clear out. - OK. How long did that last? - What? Nah, man, one doesn't even count. Sure it doesn't. I'm good, asshole. You want me to put it out? That's it. You've given up, you've lost. Are you crazy? You really want me to put it out? Right here. Go on. I'm messing with you now. I'm not even tempted. Yeah man, you're extra cool. Cioca-Zen, man. Cocksuckers... Hi, Ramona. - So, do Ideserve a drink? - Sure you do. Give me that bottle. Ramona's a champion. Here, take a sit. But we've got nothing to pour it into. Take my glass. l'll drink from the bottle. Dry? Dry. Cheers! Bottom's up. Can't. I'll get drunk and talk nonsense. - God forbid! - Ramones. - Have you ever listened to Ramones? - What's that? - Wafers. - Shut up. So, Ramona, who did you like best? Yeah, Ramona, tell us. Him. Got you, Boogie! Can I get the money now? - What money? - Very funny. I don't get it. - Come on, give her the money. - Why? Didn't she like it? You didn't like it? For real now... Yeah, a real pleasure. l'll want your phone number. Now we have to pay her, too. It's you she liked best. She told me she'd never seen such a beautiful cock. It was even prettier before I lost weight. - Thank you for the lovely hot meal! - Thanks for coming. Can I get in here to warm up? I'm freezing. Sure, hop in. Careful now, you don't want to cool off there. Didn't we cool off already? She got you there. - So? - So what? How's life on the coast? Got yourself a guy with a BMW? Life's good, but I haven't found anyone. You could have hit it off big with this Swede here. - You live in Sweden? - Yes. Why? I know a gil1 there. - What's her name? - Laura. Don't know her. So, are you colleagues? He's from Sweden, woman. High school. When did you graduate? -'43. -'92. '92. I was four then. Lovely age. And you had checkered uniforms? She's laughing at us. Let me open it. I told you, she's trying to embarrass us. Iworked a year in a bar in Eforie. You have to press down a bit. Then pull hard. - Here. - You're from Euphoria? - Medgidia. - Turkish? Give the poor guy your glasses. - But are you? - No. Don't get upset. I'm not upset. - I know a bit of TUl1(iSh. - Spit it out! - What was that? - Sounded like 'Wonn up your ass'. - Something with 'friend'. - 'Thank you, friend.' See, Penescu knows? Doing shady deals with the Turks helps. Ugly language. Like Swedish is better. Sounds like you're puking. Why are you laughing, pumpkin? You think he's funny? - I'll show you. - No, please! I'm ticklish. Stop it. I passed out once. Why the fuck are you such a moron? - OK. Sorry. - I'm serious. I believe you. I didn't know. Great girl! I'm sorry. Let me kiss you. Normally I wouldn't have gone... but a cousin from Eforie took me there. Ramona went to Italy with a girl. Very nice. For how long? - 3 months. In the summer. - I see. - When's your plane? - Tuesday. I need to spend a day with my folks. They've been driving me crazy. Maybe we can meet tomorrow and talk some more. Nah, he'll be under curfew. I have to spend some time with the kid. I didn't get to see him much lately. Of course. Maybe I can skip the morning sunbathing. You have to catch the ultra-violets? I don't think I can, though. I thought we'd go to Mamaia, ride in the gondola, see Aqua Park. Has it opened? No. Just to see what it's like. Cool. The kid will love it. I don't know about this summer. He's afraid of water. Last year he bruised me all over when I took him in. On my arms or on the float. - He'll get used to it. - You think? I didn't go in the water till I was seven. My folks would give me a chocolate bar if I went in a littie. After that it was like I just let go. Get him out of my hair. He wants to swim now, the ass. Up yours! Go to Sweden, funny guy. Pour some for me too, princess. A light one? Light-ish. Man, the 1st of May has turned to crap. Yes, fuck it. I don't think even half the hotels will open this summer. It's better in Mamaia. Maybe next year we'll go to the Bulgarian coast. Either there or in Sweden, if you invite us to the wedding. What wedding? The cocksucker's getting married. Didn't you know? Not a clue. Good for you, you dog. Wear it till you tear it! Congratulations. We'll see what happens by next year. You said you could hardly wait to get your work permit and... Well, your business. - And don't you forget it. - I won't. Is it hard to find work there? Yeah, it's hard. Well, let me know ahead of time, I'll have my best tuxedo dry-cleaned and all. Stop busting my balls, man. Go fuck yourself. It was you who say she was stupid and boring. Not anymore. Got a problem with that? - No problem. - Well you needn't have, Penescu, that woman treated you like her own brother when you visited us. Right... You're marrying her because she was nice to me? Maybe she's the woman I need now. Did you think of that? What the fuck. I think she's cool, and she helped me a lot. Well, you be cool too, make her a couple of littie Swedes. And then dump her, because that's cool too... Look who's giving me advice. He never had a girlfriend for more than three months straight. Guru! If you're not sure, better not have any children. What children? You're listening to shit-mouth here. Fuck, man... Whatdid she call you? Muky? Muky! You hurt me Muky fucker! You show me the way, guru! - L'll fucking knock your teeth sideways! - Let's see that! - There's nothing to see, you dickhead. - No really, let's see! Enough. You both get out. I have some business with Ramona. - At this hour? - He's sitting for a late exam. - Out, please. - Where? It's cold! Then wait for me in the lobby. Move it, young groom. Hands off or I'll kick the shit out of you! I'm not kidding, Penescu. I'll just stay here in a comer and jerk off, I won't bother anyone. Can I show you out? What a prick. - Should I undress? - Absolutely. I'd just warmed up. - Do we turn right? - After we pass Ceausescu's villa. Who lives there these days? Ho Chi Min. - So are we going, guys? - Where? To the beach! Yeah, you go ahead. Ceausescu's villa. - That's not his villa. - It is, man. How the fuck do you know it's not this one? There're no peacocks here. - Weren't there peacocks in his garden? - It's this one. Really. I think there are. Maybe they're just sleeping now. Why should they be asleep now? They're birds. - They're not here. - They must be. You sound like you're getting it up the ass. - They've got to be here. - That's not how it goes, it's not '0'. Like you know, Tarzan boy. Sorry, I locked it after you left. I see Adi hasn't woken up. He tossed around all night. I thought you'd left for breakfast. Where should we go for breakfast? I don't know right now. Are you going to sleep now? If you've got nothing against it. No, go ahead, while you're resting, aflerAdi's up, I'll go to Neptun with him and we'll get something to eat. There's a coffee place at the mall, I think it's open. Did you have a good time? Please. Let's not start all that again. I was asking in honest. Yes. I wanted to say I was sorry about the fight and I thought about it. I didn't put it right. I wanted you to stay. But I didn't put it right. I see. What hurt me most was that you called me irresponsible. I didn't call you irresponsible. Smaranda, I remember, believe me. Some of the things I said are true. But I overreacted. Anyway- I thought it was good that we had that talk and spoke our minds. It's better to talk more often, so things don't pile up. What hurt me most is what you said about Adi. I'm sorry. But you know, it's better if you make more time for him. The kid is very fond of you. What did you want me to do? He was sleeping. Not when he's asleep. When he's up. You know I think about all that. I'm not blind, you know. I know you're not. Anyway, if we don't talk, these things pile up. I'm sorry I overreacted. Did you smoke? Two cigarettes. And that's the end of it. The badgers up. Come here. - Where's Mama? - In the bathroom. What do you want to play with? My excavators. Go get them. Up. - Horseback riding? - Horseback riding. - Good morning. - Morning. Are you awake? - We're having the excavator in bed with us? - Yes. Look, pick up the load. Adi, don't you want to let Daddy sleep? - No. - It's fine. I'm not sleeping. Wait. You have to put your finger there. - I'll go get the cranes. - Go get them. I'll go make coffee. Let's have a construction site here, Adi.
