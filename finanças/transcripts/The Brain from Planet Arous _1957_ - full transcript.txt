(dramatic orchestral music) (suspenseful music) (thunderous explosion) (suspenseful music) - Checks out all right. I don't understand it. Hey, Dan, it doesn't make any sense. - [Dan] Mm hmm. - I said it doesn't make any sense. The Geiger counter's been going on and off all morning, and the nucleometer is riding along with it. - Ah, you talk like a man with rocks in your head. Radio activity's a constant thing. Either it's there-- (Geiger counter crackling) - Oh yeah? (Geiger counter crackling) - Radon gas seepage? - AEC checked this whole area two years ago. - Couldn't be a plane flying over the bombing range with an atomic warhead. - Not unless he's hedgehopping. - Maybe just a blast of cosmic energy from the sun. - Impossible. This stuff is coming from right there, only 30 miles away. - The base of Mystery Mountain. - Or in the mountain itself. - Hello, anybody home? Do you know it's three o'clock, and you mad scientists haven't even stopped for lunch? - Huh, no wonder I've been getting insulting messages from my stomach. (lips smacking) - Hello, Sal. Something going on over at Mystery Mountain. - On Mystery Mountain? - The most God forsaken spot on the desert. Hasn't seen a human being since 1900 when the prospectors gave it up. Sure must be hot out there. - Dad says he can't understand how the Army missed building a base out there it's so miserable. (Geiger counter crackling) - There it goes again. (Geiger counter crackling) Look at that dial, 20 millirems. Why, per square, that'd be... Dan, we're going over to Mystery Mountain. - Not before we eat! - No, I've got the fires down to a beautiful coal on the barbecue, and, well, you just have to eat, come on. (whimsical orchestral music) - (sniffs) Oh, boy, I can hardly wait. Hey Steve, if we're gonna take a trip to Mystery Mountain, can't we get Jim to take us over with the scintillator? That's the easy way. - Nope, we're going in a jeep. I don't wanna scare away who's ever out there with a plane. - Ah, for now fly out into the patio, or I'll never get this lunch together. What do you expect to find out there, Steve, a crank using an old mine for experiments? - You got me. - Spooks, gotta be spooks. Hey, what're you doing, incinerating them? I like mine pretty raw. - Better feed him before he becomes violent. - Go sit down, both of you. - Hi, Mr. Fallon. - Dan, Steve. - Hey, ah, if you like your hamburgers cremated, you're just in time. - Oh, thank you, Dan. Well, I didn't know we were having a party. - Yeah, a little going away party for Steve and me. - Making a trip, Steve? - Just over to Mystery Mountain. - Well, what in the world would take you out there at this time of the year? Must be at least 120 in the desert. - [Dan] That's what I've been telling him. - There's something going on over there. - [Sally] Open the door for me, will you, please, Dan? - Well, you can't just leave me there, Steve, go on. - There's a hot blast of gamma coming from Mystery Mountain. That's cause enough for any scientist to go into the desert. Lucky it's intermittent. If it was constant, we'd be fried. - Oh, either way we get fried, by a gamma ray, or a jeep ride across a desert at 120 in the shade, which the nearest of is 20 miles away. - All right, Danny boy, if you feel delicate, I'll go alone. - What and get lost? Oh, please remember, Steve, I'm your brain. Don't make a move without me. - Have you any idea what it could be, Steve? - No, that's what we're gonna find out. Give me some onions, will ya, Sally? The way Dan's piling them on, I'm gonna have to eat some in self-defense. - How long do you expect to be gone? - [Dan] Three or four days, if the spooks don't get us. - Don't you think you ought to notify the AEC, Steve? - No, not till we find out first. - Hmm, curiosity. - I know, kills cats. We've got 18 lives between us. - Hmm, and no more hamburgers. (Sally chuckles) (dramatic orchestral music) (jeep thuds) - I guess we can't make it any further in the jeep. - I suppose we're about to pick up our gear and walk from here. - You supposed right. Try the scintillator, will ya? - Couldn't be deader. - Recorded this morning. You saw it. - (spits) This water tastes like weak tea. It's practically boiling. - Well, I'll be darned. Take a look at this. A little more than halfway down and to the left. What do you see? - A pile of rocks. - Wasn't there last winter. Come on, Dan. It's not far. Daylight's about to run out on us. - Boy, when I think I could have studied accounting, and worked in an air-conditioned office. (suspenseful music) Boy, I'd have bet eight to five against it, we'd take-- - Dan, over here! (suspenseful music) Dan, look at this cave. Just been blasted out recently. That explains that pile of rocks. Take a look at those markings. - Yeah, somebody's gone to a lot of trouble, and they had to have a good reason. - No, nobody's been in there. There are no footprints anywhere. Let's take a look inside. - It's probably pull up beer cans. (suspenseful music) (rock thuds) (suspenseful music) Find anything, Steve? - Dead end. (suspenseful music) (Geiger counter crackling) - Steve! (Geiger counter crackling) - That way. (Geiger counter crackling) (suspenseful music) - I wish we knew what we're looking for. To find it and get out of here. (Geiger counter crackling) (suspenseful music) - See that? - The flash, of course. Think I'm walking in here with my eyes shut? - Turn the Geiger on again, will ya? - It is on. Suddenly it's cool as a well diggers foot. (suspenseful music) - There was radio activity in here before we saw it. Douse your light, Dan. (suspenseful music) See that glow? - Yeah, somebody's in that passage. - Get the rifle ready. Want me to take it? - No, come on. (suspenseful music) - Hello in there! We're friends, come on out! (suspenseful music) Our friend turned off his flashlight. - Anti-social. We go in after him? (suspenseful music) (rifle clicks) - We're coming in! We don't want any trouble, but we're armed in case you are! (gun clicks) (suspenseful music) - Dead end and nothing. - You saw that light. - You can't beat facts, Steve. We've covered every inch of this passages, and there's no one here. (suspenseful music) (Geiger counter crackling) (suspenseful music) - We better get outta here. - Well, I'm with you. We'll get the... Look! (suspenseful music) What is it, Steve? (gun firing) - We gotta get past it somehow. (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (Steve grunting) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (telephone ringing) - Hello? Oh, oh, hello, Dad. No, I haven't heard from Steve or Dan for a whole week. You know them. They get real carried away if they find anything unusual. Yeah, Jim called and if it's right with you, we're going up to Mystery Mountain this afternoon. Mm hmm, surprise them. (suspenseful music) All right, Dad, I'll see you about one. I'll have lunch ready for you. Okay, bye bye. (suspenseful music) Steve. - The prodigal returns. Glad to see me? - Am I (giggles)? You two have been up at Mystery Mountain a whole week. - You know what we found? Absolutely nothing. (both chuckle) (suspenseful music) - Wow. - What's the matter? - You never kissed me like that before, wow. - I never missed you so much before. - (giggles) You should stay away more often. Where's Dan? - Oh, you know Dan, playboy at heart. One week in the mountains, and he has to go to Las Vegas to recuperate. - What's the matter, Steve? - Nothing's the matter. - But, well, you're different. - I don't know what you mean, different. I'm still the same old lovable character I always was. (suspenseful music) Excuse me, Sally. - What happened out there, tell me. - Nothing, Sally (gasping). Now, now, don't you worry your pretty little head about it. - No, not until you've told me the truth. I'm Sally, remember? The girl you're going to marry. I know you, Steve, and I know when there's something wrong. - I don't know what you're talking about. If you mean that, that pain I had, it was just a tooth kicking up. (suspenseful music) Come here. (suspenseful music) You're just spooked, you know it? Getting all fired up just because I don't explain a toothache. - Well, you acted funny, and that way you kissed me. (suspenseful music) - Like that? - It makes my toes tingle. (suspenseful music) (gasps) Don't, Steve! Oh, you're, you're holding me too tight. Steve (screams)! (suspenseful music) (George snarling) (suspenseful music) Don't, no, don't, Steve! Stop it, Steve! (George snarling) (suspenseful music) (George whimpers) (suspenseful music) Steve! - I'm sorry. - You've been working too hard. You've got to see a doctor. - Don't expert me, Sally, I'm all right! (suspenseful music) - Georgie, Georgie, he didn't mean it. Something's the matter with Steve. What happened to him out there? (suspenseful music) (Steve groaning) (suspenseful music) - Who are you? What do you want? - [Gor] I am Gor. I need your body as a dwelling place while I am here on your Earth. - Why me? - [Gor] Because you are a recognized nuclear scientist. Because you have entree to places on Earth I want to go. I chose your body very carefully, even before I knew about Sally, a very exciting female. - Leave Sally out of this. - [Gor] Why, she appeals to me. There are some aspects of the life of an Earth savage that are exciting and rewarding, things that are missed by the brains on my planet, Arous. - If you so much as touch Sally, I'll-- - [Gor] It is you who are touching her. Even I must have some interest to spur me on. She'll do very nicely. (suspenseful music) - I warned you! (object thuds) (glass rattling) - [Gor] None of your puny weapons will affect me. As long as you are alive, you will have me using your body, directing your brain, turning your simple little will off and on like a key and a lock. (Steve grunts) You saw what happened to your friend. I'm sparing you only because I need you. For as long as I wish to be, I am you. (Steve gasping) (car engine humming) (birds chirping) - Hi, Sally. - Oh, Dad, Dad. - What is it, what's the matter? - It's Steve. - Something happened to Steve? - I don't know. He, he was here just an hour ago. I can't explain it to you. He, he was changed. I think he was ill. He, he looked like he, well, I just can't tell you. It was awful. - You think he's ill? - No, no, he never looked better, but it was as if he was a stranger. - (chuckles) Well, I'll talk to Dan. He'll know whatever it is that's bothering Steve. I wouldn't worry. - Steve says Dan went to Las Vegas. I don't believe it. It's not like Dan. There's something wrong. - Did it ever occur to you that Steve might have something on his mind? Well, I'll run over to the lab and see if I can help. If I were you, I'd put another place on the table. (birds chirping) (suspenseful music) Don't you answer your door anymore? - I'm sorry, I, I didn't hear you knock. - I can only stay a minute. Steve, something's the matter between you and Sally. What is it? - (sighs) Oh, nothing really. Sally's just a little upset with me for staying away so long. She'll get over it. - It's more than that, Steve. I know Sally pretty well by this time. She's worried about you. Why don't you come back to the house with me, and have lunch with us? - Well, I'd like to. I'd like to come over and talk to you about (grunts). (suspenseful music) - Steve. - I can't come over now. Will you please leave? - Of course, if that's what you want. - That's what I want. - Steve, I think you're ill. May I call Dr. Parker for you? (suspenseful music) - No, mind your own business, will you? Get out of here! (suspenseful music) - Aren't you worried at all about Steve, Dad? - Of course I am, Sally, but Steve's a grown man. He has his problems. We all have. - But I'm in love with him. We're going to be married. Well, don't you think we should do something if he's sick? - Sally, I don't like to interfere in other people's affairs. Steve is terribly upset by something. If he wanted to take me into his confidence, he would. - But if you could've seen the way he acted here this afternoon, you'd, well, (sighs) well, I can't explain it to you, Dad. Something terrible has happened to Steve, and what's more, I don't think Dan is in Las Vegas. It, it isn't like Dan just to suddenly disappear like that. - Well, what do you wanna do, Sally? I'm willing to try anything if it'll help. - Well, whatever happened to Steve happened on Mystery Mountain. I'd feel a lot better if we could go there to see if we can find the answer. - It's a terrible trip this time of the year. - I know, but just the same I'd like to make it tomorrow. - Well, I've spoiled you too long to try to stop now. We'll leave tomorrow morning. You get the food and water and I'll get the other gear. - (sighs) Thanks, Dad. I, I don't know what we'll find out there, but at least we'll be trying. (whimsical orchestral music) (suspenseful music) - Looks like the end of the line for the car anyway. - Look, Dad, their canteen. - Jeep tracks too. Must have walked down the mountain from here. Get the water. I'll get the flashlight. - Okay. (suspenseful music) - Careful, honey. (suspenseful music) - Oh, oh, I'm beat, Dad. Woo, must be 120 out here today. - This is no place to rest. At least there's shade in that cave over there. - That cave. I've been out here with Steve before, and I know that cave wasn't here. - Come on, it's just a step. (suspenseful music) - This cave wasn't here. -All right, Sally, I believe you, but I don't see how all this rock could've been blasted from the mountain without us knowing about it. (suspenseful music) This passage goes back as far as my light will reach. - I'm telling you, Dad, it wasn't here, or Steve or I would've seen it. You know Steve. - The rock isn't even discolored. You're right, Sally. This cave was blasted open within the last two weeks to the outside. (suspenseful music) Here are their footprints. At least we know they came this far. (suspenseful music) - There's a side passage, Dad. (suspenseful music) Dad, did you see that flash of light? - No, I didn't, honey. It was probably my light reflecting. (suspenseful music) (Sally screaming) (suspenseful music) It's all right, Sally, it's me! (Sally gasps) We'd better get out of here. - Oh no, no, something in there happened to change Steve, and I'm going to find out what it was. (suspenseful music) Look. (suspenseful music) Steve's scintillator. He must've had a real good reason for leaving that behind. - Yes, I know, honey. He must've been in a hurry. (suspenseful music) - You can turn the light back on, Dad. I saw it. - Stay here. (suspenseful music) - He's dead, isn't he? (suspenseful music) What was it? What caused it? - I don't know, nothing I'm familiar with. (suspenseful music) - All this has something to do with the way Steve's been acting. - We'd better get back to town, and report this to the sheriff. - [Val] Earthlings. (mysterious music) - Who, what are you? - [Val] Do not be afraid. I am a friend. I am not of your Earth. My name is Val. I am from the planet, Arous. I was sent here by my leader to capture the criminal, Gor, who escaped from Arous to your planet Earth. He has already voided that human in the passage. He is cunning and dangerous. I need your help. - What can we do? - [Val] Do you know the dead one's companion? - Yes, he's a very good friend. - [Val] He has been behaving strangely? - Yes, he has. - [Val] His body has been taken over by this criminal I seek. If you have regard for your friend, not a word of this meeting to anyone. Tomorrow night at eight o'clock, I will appear at your home. We will make our plans there. (suspenseful music) - Dad, what are we going to do? - We must do as the thing says. We have no choice. (suspenseful music) - Yes, this is Steve March. I'd like to speak to Colonel Frogley, Atomic Energy Headquarters, Indian Springs. Could you put me through please? Hello, Colonel, Steve March. Yeah, you're right. I'm calling in connection with those tests you planned this week. Oh, just small ones, eh? Well, I'd still like to be there as an observer. Friday? All right. I certainly appreciate this, Colonel. I'll be there. Goodbye, sir. (suspenseful music) - [Gor] 80 Friday, the savages are going to play with their new toy. Go, I will be there (laughing manically) as an observer. I am going to demonstrate something Friday. I have a surprise for them. (book thuds) (suspenseful music) - Somebody's gotta be able to stop you! Get out, get out, get out (sobs)! - [Gor] Your feeling of helplessness is your best friend, savage. When I am occupying your body, or in my present transitory form, I am without substance and indestructible. You are fortunate that, Gor, one of the greatest intellects in a world, where intelligence is all, has chosen to use your body. I, Gor, in your stupid body, will have power of life or death over this civilization. Through me, you shall have power such as no man has ever seen before in the history of your planet. The power of your intellect. (bells chiming) - Dad. (suspenseful music) (George barking) - [Val] Good dog, good dog. Please be seated. I come to you on the friendliest of missions. - What do you want us to do? - [Val] You can help me save the Earth from a terrible experience. Yes, the whole Earth. Gor is insane for power. That's why he came to Earth when he escaped from Arous. You are a weaker new civilization. With Gor's power and his ambition, he could rule it. - How can you stop him? - [Val] I will have to force him out of the body of your friend to take him back to Arous for his punishment. If I can not, your friend will have to give life to save the world. - But why should Steve have to die? - [Val] Well, we will try to save him. Now, I need a host, an Earth body. - Take mine. - No, Sally, I'd like to help. - [Val] Let me explain. Once I'm in your body, I will be in complete control of your thoughts, your movements, your life. I must have your complete agreement, and very complete cooperation in every way. - I agree. - I will need a body that will be inconspicuous, and constantly around Gor. Think it over carefully. Perhaps the young lady would be the best. - George, what about George? - [Val] The dog? He is intelligent, devoted, strong. - And he's always with Steve and me. (suspenseful music) (whimsical music) - [Gor] We will take the young female for a ride in your car. I will enjoy being you tonight. She gives me a very strange, very new elation. (Steve gasping) (suspenseful music) (light jazz music) (suspenseful music) (plane engine roaring) (suspenseful music) (plane explodes) (suspenseful music) - How can I let my daughter put herself in hands of this thing? How long must this go on? - [Val] Only until I can capture Gor outside of Steve's body. No harm shall come. - Are you sure? - [Val] I have powers that equal and surpass the powers of Gor. - Here he comes. - [Val] Remember, we must do nothing to make Gor suspicious. You must treat Steve as you have always treated him. - But how can I? I'm scared to death of him. - [Val] You must find strength. (suspenseful music) (knocking on door) (suspenseful music) - Hello, John. Hi, Sally. - [Sally] Hi. - Better get a sweater on. I got the top down. - All right. - Hello, George. Come on, boy, put your feet up. Come on, come on, fella. How are you, old mutt (chuckles)? - 80 Dan decided to visit the fleshpots. -Ah, yeah. John, about the, about that scene the other day. I'm ah, I'm sorry. - It's forgotten, we all have our bad days. - I, I guarantee it'll never happen again. If you can forgive me, I, I was mad at Dan. He ran out on me in the midst of a very important experiment. I don't know. Things just piled up. - Forget it, Steve, forget it. It never happened. But I am glad to see you in your usual good humor. - [Sally] All set, master? - Let's go. (George whimpering) Oh, you wanna go, Georgie? All right, you can go if you promise not to drive. - Have a good time, kids. (suspenseful music) - That's our world out there, Sally, yours and mine. - [Sally] Really, all of it? - If you want it. - You been out in the sun a lot today with no hat on? - I can give it to you, believe me. (suspenseful music) - Not so rough, Steve. Goodness, you've turned into a regular caveman. (suspenseful music) - You see a difference in me, eh? I am different, Sally And the whole world's going to know how different by next Friday. I'm going to the atomic bomb test in Indian Springs. I'm gonna watch the test with Colonel Frogley and Professor Tate, and then I'm gonna introduce my discovery. It'll make the atomic bomb look like a firecracker. - You frighten me when you talk like that. - It's true, I've discovered a power that's gonna make me the most feared man on Earth. - Is that what you want? - Power, that's what everyone wants. That's why the office boy wants to be the boss. That's why the private wants to be the general, power (chuckles) and I've got it. - I wish you'd tell me what you're talking about, Steve. It doesn't make any sense. - I can't. (suspenseful music) - Don't, Steve (gasping), Steve! - You think you can get away from me, you can't. - Don't (gasping)! - I want you, Sally, and what I want I take! - No (gasping)! (George barking and snarling) (suspenseful music) - I, I kind of got carried away out there, didn't I? - Yes, you did. - Do any good to say I'm sorry? - You know I love you, Steve, but I hardly knew you tonight. - Forget it. - If you want me to. - Thanks. - What are you going to do Friday, Steve? - I'm going to the atomic test as an observer. You can forget all that crazy talk. - All right. - Forget all about tonight, will you? - Okay? (car engine revs) - [Broadcaster] The plane, a worldwide liner, with 38 passengers board, simply exploded in mid-air according to eyewitnesses. The wreckage is high on the side of Mount Alamogordo. Rescue parties are now on their way to the scene of the tragedy. Although there is little hope that any of the victims will be found alive. - Mount Alamogordo, it's only 20 miles away. We might be able to help. (whimsical orchestral music) (siren wailing) - You, couple of your men up there! Give 'em a hand with this litter! Turn that light over here! Get that light over here! - Another body coming over the hill, Colonel. - Good, bring him right up here. Take it easy, take it easy. Get the door. (volunteers chattering) Turn that light back on down here! - Colonel Hawk, anything we can? - Still some bodies missing. - Well, we were driving a few miles away, heard the broadcast. - Hold it right there, fellas. This is not for you, miss. (volunteers chattering) - They all look like that? - Have you ever see anything else that flash burns so violently? All right, men. I wanna show you something else. Brought Professor Tate from Indian Springs over with me. He's been testing the only piece of metal we could find so far. Plane exploded over a hundred acres. - Oh, hi, Steve. - Hello, Dale, radiation? - Well, it seems almost certain, yet there's no contamination. I've never seen anything like this before. - Now what we're telling you is in strict confidence, Steve. We don't wanna start a panic. Better take this piece, and get it over to Indian Springs lab. - Steve, see you later. - Bye, Dale. (volunteers chattering) - I couldn't help hearing what he said, Steve. It was terrible. - Could be the beginning of the end. - What you mean? - You heard what he said. That accident was caused by something we've never seen before. - What did cause it? - If the professor's right, it was caused by a power from outside of this world. - Do you really believe that, Steve? - There's nothing else to believe. (mysterious music) (crickets chirping) - [Sally] Why would it do a thing like that? - To demonstrate its power over the Earth? (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) Oh, I'm sorry. I, I didn't mean to frighten you with my theories, hun. - If your theories were true, we'd be at the mercy of this thing. - Yes, such a creature could rule the whole world. (suspenseful music) - Oh, Dad, it was awful. We went to the plane crash. Those people were burned just the way Dan was. It was that thing that possesses him that did it. - Now Sally, this is a time for the thinking and planning, not crying. - I know, I know. There must be some way to stop it. - [Val] It will not be an easy task. Gor is not vulnerable while he is in the body of the human or in his transitory stage. Only when he is in his true form, can he be killed or captured? - Can a human kill him at such a time? - [Val] It is possible. In his true state, a heavy blow on the point, known to your surgeons as the fissure of Rolando, can kill. - Is there any special time when Gor might assume such a, a state? - [Val] In Earth's atmosphere, we must return to our true state once every 24 hours in order to assimilate enough oxygen for life. - If we could tell Steve of this fissure of Rolando. - [Val] That is very dangerous. It would have to be done when Gor is not inhabiting the body. If Gor even suspected your friend of having this information, he would kill him immediately. - There must be some answer to this horrible situation. Perhaps the Army. - [Val] The Army could do no good. - Then what are we supposed to do? Just sit and wait. I love him, Dad. Do you understand? I, I just can't leave him alone when he needs help. - You can't help him, Sally. (suspenseful music) Nobody can. (suspenseful music) (knocking on door) - Come in! - Hello, Steve! - Hello, Wiley, what's the law doing out on a night like this? - Drove over to talk to you. - Well, sit down. I'll pour you cup of coffee. - All right? - What have I done? - Oh, I reckon nothing, Steve. Just got some questions I wanna ask you. - Oh, about the plane accident? I was there. - No, it's about Danny Murphy. - Dan, is he in trouble? - Well, it depends on the way you look at it. He's dead. - Dead, what happened? I was hoping you could tell me, Steve. Found his body in a cave on Mystery Mountain. You went out there with him, didn't you? - Yeah, and I came back with him. He said he was going to Las Vegas. - Yeah, so I understand. We did an autopsy on Dan's body, Steve. He never made it to Las Vegas. - Well, he said he was going. - Yeah, autopsy showed he'd been dead since the day you two went out there. Doc put the cause of death as burns. Said his body was cindered, just like the bodies in that plane wreck. Don't reckon, you'd know too much about that. But there's more to this business in the cave than you've told me. - Planning on arresting me, Sheriff? - Well, I might. - On what grounds? - You lied about Dan. Said he was in Las Vegas, when all the time you knew he was dead. That's grounds enough. You and he are also mighty fond of that Fallon girl. You're in a little trouble, Steve. - Oh no, I'm not. You're the one that's in trouble. Yeah, I killed Dan. I killed those people in that plane too, and now I'm gonna kill you. (suspenseful music) - I'm taking you in, Steve. - Oh no, you're not. (suspenseful music) (Steve laughing manically) (suspenseful music) (triumphant music) - Heat intense enough to do this must have been caused by some sort of a A blast, but there's no radio activity. What do you make of it, Professor Tate? - Well, the burns are unlike those of uranium or cobalt-60, or any other daughter product we know of it present. - Then there's only one answer. We have been invaded, not the United States, but the world has been invaded. (men murmuring) - Fantastic. - Not so fantastic, gentlemen, We're talking of invading the moon. Our job is to find out who the invaders are, and try to work with them. We are certainly helpless against them. - But what about the atomic test tomorrow at Indian Springs, Colonel? - I've had a conference call with my colleagues. We can see nothing to be gained by delaying the tests. The proximity of the plane disaster to the testing grounds convinces us that the invaders are in that area. The tests may be instrumental, in bringing them out into the open. Physicians report from Indian Springs. The condition of the bodies recovered from the plane crash is identical with that of the nuclear scientist, Dan Murphy, killed at Mystery Mountain. Death by intense radiation. (men murmuring) Gentlemen, gentlemen, The knowledge we have must be treated as top secret. We want no panic. Only key personnel in your units will be briefed on our suspicions. We should move at once to Indian Springs, and prepare for any emergency. - [Man] All right, that's that. (car engine humming) - [Steve] Come on, George, get out. Come on, boy. Hey, you got company! - Sally, can't let him know you're frightened. - Always at meal time. You can smell meat and potatoes clear out to your lab. - Came by for that and to return your beast, George. Came over to visit me last night. Almost ate me outta house and home. Hello, John. - Hello, Steve, as long as you're here, won't you stay for a bite to eat? - I plan to. Gotta go home early though. Big day tomorrow at Indian Springs Just got the weather reports. Perfect for the tests. Gonna be a lot of brass there, that's good. I wanna talk to them about some ideas I've developed. (chuckles) Got some surprises for them. - Well ah, I'll go get dinner ready? - So the experiments are going well. You've worked hard, Steve. You deserve some recognition. - I'll get it tomorrow. - Giving out any hints, or do I have to wait with the rest of the world? - No, no hints, John. Well, maybe ah, one hint. I'll tell you this much. I'm gonna give a demonstration tomorrow that'll create as much excitement as the bombing of Hiroshima. Not much left for George. Come on, boy, sit up. - Now that was a good dinner, Sally. - Don't sound so surprised. - Well, I'm going to the den and get to work before the dish washing starts. - Every silver lining has a dark cloud. Guess, I'm stuck. - That's what I want for my birthday, a dishwasher. - Well, I'll see you after the dishes are washed. (birds chirping) - Oh, you don't have to help me, Steve. I know you're in a hurry to get home. - Ah, I'll wash them twice the next time. Won't be long now, hun, and you'll be Mrs. Steve March, okay? - You know it is. - You'll like living in Washington. - Washington? - Yeah, servants, everything your little heart desires. - We're going to be rich. - Mm, richer than that. Pictures in the paper. Royally calling on you. - You scare me when you talk like that, Steve. - (chuckles) You don't believe me. - Of course I don't. I know you're just kidding, but you kid too much. It's, it's becoming an obsession. All this power and money, who needs it? -I do! And you will too. It's habit forming, Sally. The more you get, the more you want. You'll see what I mean tomorrow. - I don't understand you anymore, Steve. What's going to happen tomorrow? What is it that's going to make all this difference? - (chuckles) You'll just have to wait and see. Love me? - You know I do. - Gonna marry me? - [Sally] Mm hmm. - No matter what happens? - I can't think of anything that would keep me from loving Steve March. - You're more important to me than anything, Sally. You know that. - That's the way I feel about you, Steve. Only you've suddenly got a yen for power and money. I guess there's nothing strange about that. - Not for a man who's in love with the most wonderful for girl in the world. I want those things for you, you silly little idiot. - Now, don't get started on that again. - Okay, you don't wanna be rich and famous. - All right, powerhouse. So you don't wanna do the dishes, get going. I've gotta keep my mind on my work. - See you tomorrow on way home from Indian Springs. - [Sally] Okay. (suspenseful music) (triumphant music) - Well, Steve, glad you got here. - Hello, Colonel, I understand you have a lot of brass out here for the test today. - We have, we also have a very serious situation, Steve. There's a top drawer meeting scheduled, oh, here they are right now. General Brown, I'm sure you've heard of Dr. Steve March. He's been conducting experiments in nuclear fission on a grant here in the desert. Steve, General Brown. - How'd you do. I'm afraid, March, that this meeting is top secret. - I ah, understand General. The Colonel was just telling me. However, before the meeting starts, I'd like to have a few words with you gentlemen. I promise you I won't waste your time. - Well, I'm afraid the business we have at the moment is more important, March. Come along, Colonel. - I'm sure it isn't, General. This meeting is about the mysterious explosion of the passenger plane and the radiation burning of my assistant, Dan Murphy, isn't it? I can explain those deaths, if you and the rest of the gentlemen would give me a few moments of your time. (men murmuring) -All right, two minutes. (men murmuring) - Sit down, sit down, gentlemen. Gentlemen, before I can ask you to take what I have to say seriously, I want to show you something. This is a closed circuit television set focused on the test area, isn't it? - Yes. - And ah, these buildings and equipment have been placed in the desert for destruction by the atom blast? - [General] That's right. - Would you all kindly watch the screen? (suspenseful music) (thunderous explosion) (Steve laughing manically) (suspenseful music) - [Man] Attention all personnel! This is an emergency! That was not the atom bomb that blew up! Repeat, that was not the planned explosion! - What you just seen me do to that one small area, I can do to a city, a nation, or a continent. - Fantastic, and you brought down that plane? - I did. - And you killed your assistant with this power? - I did and I'll kill anybody else that interferes with my plans. Get out of your chair, Frogley. Let the general sit down. (suspenseful music) Sit down, General! I know what you're all thinking. That I must be destroyed, but I can't be destroyed. And any attempt by any means to do so will bring forth reprisals that will shock the whole world. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) I hope that will be sufficient proof that I am to be dealt with in a sensible manner. (suspenseful music) Now these are my orders to you. In 10 hours at exactly eight o'clock tonight, I want to meet with authorized representatives from the United States, England, France, Russia, China, and India. I will state my proposition at that time. Any country I've mentioned that does not have a representative with full power to act, present in this room at that time, will find its capital city completely wiped out at 10 minutes past that hour. - But that isn't enough time. - But that's all the time you have. (Steve laughing manically) (suspenseful music) - General, what're we gonna do? - I must get in touch with Barkley! - Hello, operator, get me the White House, will you? This is General Brown. - Yes, this is Jensen. - Boy, am I beat. That meeting this morning knocked the stuffing out of me. - But was it successful? - Oh, I shook him 'em up a little, but the meeting tonight's the main event. - And you can't tell me anything about it? - You'll read about it in the papers. - When I'm rich and famous? - Yeah. Like maybe tomorrow. - 80 quick? - You know me when I get going. I'm a fireball. - You know, operator, it looks like you could use a nap, before the evening's festivities. - Will you wake me in time to dress? - Sure, 6:30, that'll give you plenty of time. Oh, it's ah, 5:10 now. You'd better get some sleep. He's asleep, he has to be at the meeting at eight. - [Val] Gor is tired because he has had no opportunity to return to his true form for oxygen. He will be over the 24 hour period. - Yes? - [Val] He will be very vulnerable. - You mean that spot near the top of the brain known as the, the fissure of Rolando? - [Val] You have a good memory. (suspenseful music) - Steve, Steve, wake up, it's 6:30. You'll have to hurry. Come on, wake up (Steve moans) Enough time for that mush. Right now you have to get going. - Oh, brow beater. - (scoffs) Loyal friend, that's what I am. Now, get going. You know it's over an hour's drive to Indian Springs. You wanna be late for your big occasion? - Okay, okay, you win. Oh boy, am I tired? - I've got my orders, out. (Steve sighs) (birds chirping) - See tomorrow, Sal. - Not tonight? - I'm going straight home after the meeting, I'm beat. (suspenseful music) No George, you can't go this time. Come on, come on, George, get out, go on. (suspenseful music) I, ah, I'm glad to see that your government is prompt enough to save its capital city, Moscow, isn't it? - My country, the Soviet, ordered me to come. We do not believe in miracles. I am here merely as an observer. - Are there any doubters in the group? Is it possible that you want me to demonstrate my powers by wiping out your capitals city? As one of the two delegates in this room that attended your demonstration this morning, I would like to assure the other delegates at this table that there is absolutely no doubt of your power to destroy. I saw it. I saw an American colonel killed, burned to a crisp by radiation with one look from this man. After the officer had fired at him point blank with no effect. I saw him wipe out a city of concrete and steel, and a hundred tanks, trucks, guns, without leaving this room by some power of mind. Gentlemen, I am convinced, my government's convinced. And my advice to you and to your of governments is to take what this, this man says as a most serious matter. - Thank you, General. Oh, I see we still have some skepticism on some of our guest's faces. (plane engine humming) Would you gentlemen kindly step to the window? (plane engine humming) Now! (plane engine humming) Can you see that plane in the sky? (plane engine humming) - I see the plane. - Watch it. (suspenseful music) (thunderous explosion) (men chattering) (Steve laughing manically) Perhaps we can get back to the meeting without any more skepticism. (suspenseful music) Now this is my plan. I want all of your uranium, plutonium, all your atomic resources. I want your factories, railroad shipping, all of your industrial facilities. Your workers will labor around the clock day and night. Following my blueprints to build the most powerful invasion force ever gathered in the universe. - You mean to enslave the world? - Russia would never agree to it! - There's a simple answer to that. There'll be no Russia. Your United Nations building will be turned over to me. I will teach your engineers to build a fleet of interplanetary rockets, to be armed and manned by your joint military forces. All under my command. - What would you do with all this power? - I will return to my planet, Arous, and through its vast intellect, I will become master of the universe. After I'm gone, your Earth will be free to live out its miserable span of existence. And that's how it's going to be. That'll be all for now, gentlemen. I will preside over a meeting at the United Nations building at 10 o'clock in the evening, day after tomorrow. You will all be there. After all, you have no other choice, have you? (Steve laughing manically) (suspenseful music) (car engine humming) (suspenseful music) (car door thuds) (suspenseful music) (Steve sighs) (Steve grunting) (suspenseful music) - [Gor] Well, beginning tomorrow there will be a new world. (Gor laughing manically) You people have small minds. You are unable to grasp the importance of today's event. You are about to succeed where Caesar, Napoleon, and Hitler have failed. Through me you will have ruled the world, but I will rule the universe (laughing manically). You will be dictator of the world in spite of yourself. While I am on this Earth, you and Sally and I will live in a splendor such as the world has never known. (suspenseful music) (Sally screaming loudly) - Steve (screaming loudly)! No (screaming loudly)! (glass crashing) (Sally screaming loudly) (suspenseful music) (ax thuds) (Gor squealing) (suspenseful music) (Steve grunting) (suspenseful music) (mysterious music) - It's all right. It's all over (gasping). Oh, thank heavens I found your note (gasping). How did you, how did you happen to know about the fissure of Rolando? - Val. - Val? - Oh, that's right. You don't know about him. He's another brain from planet Arous. He was watching over you in George's body. George (whistles), come here, come on, George, here. (light jazz music) Val, tell Steve what you told me about Gor. (George panting) Val. (George panting) George, speak to me. (light jazz music) (Sally gasps) - You and your imagination. (dramatic orchestral music)
