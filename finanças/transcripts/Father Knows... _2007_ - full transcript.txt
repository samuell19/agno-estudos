(keyboard clacks) - Mr. Murdock? Yeah, it's Brad. No, I just finished it. Don't worry, I didn't hold back a thing. Alright, I'll be by your office in a little bit and we can discuss the options. I'll see you soon. (dramatic instrumental music) Hello. You're about to be told a story. Ah, but you already knew that. This one, is a story about love. ♫ Oh my Papa A love between a father and a son, between a son and his mother. - Okay you two. - [Brad] And a love between two boys. I'm one of the boys. My name's Brad. The other half of the love story is Ira, my childhood friend. His father, George Clark, was like a father to me. Mine died when I was very young, leaving me and my little brother all alone. Our mother worked for the airlines and was away more often than not, leaving us to be as free, and as wild as we wanted. It was a picture-perfect life of all of us living in peace and harmony. ♫ Change my tears to laughter Until all hell broke loose. So let me take you back to when it all started, Ira's 18th birthday, and what we'd call, in years to come, the declaration of independence! ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫ Cha cha cha! ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫ Cha cha ♫ Happy birthday dear Ira ♫ Happy birthday to you (loud cheering) - Make a wish! (cheering) - Everybody, everybody, guess what? George and I, bought two round-trip tickets for Janice and Ira to go to Italy! (excited scream) - Oh my God, oh my God! - [Woman] That doesn't sound like George. - It was George. - Well, I had to coax him a little bit. But it's an all-expense paid trip. Museums, cultural events, the whole nine yards. - I can see these two by the Mona Lisa. - Mona Lisa, that's in France. They're goin' to Italy. - France, Italy, two young people in love, that's the most important thing. They are staying in the same room? - No, look, okay, I have something really important to say. Okay, everyone, please be quiet, just for a couple minutes. - What, why? - Just for one second, one second. Please, please be quiet. Look, this is so hard. - At your age, I certainly hope so. (laughing) - No, no, no, please, please. Give me two-- - Later. - Give me two seconds of your time. Look, there will be no boy meets girl in Italy. I'm gay. (balloon pops) - [Brad Voiceover] For one long, painful moment, everything seemed to be frozen in time. That gallery of shocked faces. My apparent joy. Ira's dad pretending to be shocked. And Janice's famous smug. But it was that outspoken Josephine who broke the silence with that rude and tacky remark. - Shirley, your son is a fagula. - Mazel tov! - I cannot believe you said that. Please, out, out of my house! Oh my God, my son. It's all my fault, George. Ira's our only child. (gentle instrumental music) - Don't do this to yourself, Shirley. - Man, I was so proud of you. - Yeah, you just might reap the benefits. - Really? - Mm hmm. - Mistake. It's gonna be so dull around here at Christmastime. No grandchildren. It's always gonna be my fault. - Only if you choose to. - And you're okay with this? - I'm more than okay with it. If that's what he wants, that's good enough for me. Ira is the one that needs to be happy, not you, Shirley. Good night. - I should have breastfed him when he was a baby. Things would be so different now. - Sure. - And I should not have let him suck his thumb when he was young. That's where it all started. But it was the way he was doing it, George, that bothered me. The kid was obsessed. - Yes, Shirley, go to sleep. (gentle instrumental music) - How 'bout a little entertainment? I could use some reassurance that we're still normal, George. I'm all in a tither, darling. ♫ I love the nightlife ♫ I want to boogie ♫ Action (laughing) - I'm gonna wet the bed. - Remember on our honeymoon in Acapulco? - Yeah. - I just, you looked like you stepped right out of Love, American Style, all red, white, and blue. - Oh, Shirley, I have something to tell you. - Now what? - I am gay, too. - (laughs) I know better than that. - Oh yeah? Where do you get your information, Mrs. Clarke? - Oh, I have my sources. - Oh yeah, you know your husband too well. - (laughs) Oh, you're such a control freak, Mr. Clarke. - Control is good, Shirley. You seem to enjoy it. Besides, you're about to lose yours right now. I'm at the helm of this ship. You turn me on! - Aye aye, sir! (laughs) (shouts) (laughs) George, hoochie coochie! (laughs) ♫ Oh Maria (moaning) What was that? (moaning) - That, Mrs. Clarke, was you dear son coming out in full blazing colors. (moaning) - My Lord. You mean, him and-- - Why, we can and he can't? - [Brad] I'll always love you. (gentle instrumental music) - I'll see ya downstairs. (gentle instrumental music) - Morning, Ira. (gentle instrumental music) - Good morning, son. How did you sleep last night? - Good. (gentle instrumental music) Good morning, darling. - Good morning, dear. No, no, none for me, I'm in a hurry. Howdy, Brad. - Morning, sir. - How'd you sleep? - Great, and yourself? - Fine. - How did you sleep in Ira's room last night? - All right, Mom. - I love the sausage, Mrs. C. - I hate to miss this next episode, but I have to run. - Knock 'em dead, Mr. C. - Oh, I wanna talk to you tonight. - I bet. - What am I, chopped liver? - [George] This is a man-to-man talk, Mom. - I should probably get going, too. Hey, do you wanna go for a jog with me, Ira? - Cool, yeah, I'll go get changed. - All right. Thanks for the breakfast, Mrs. C. (gentle instrumental music) This was the summer I wish would've lasted forever. We were wild and young and did everything together. One might find us all over the city. From the zoo, where Ira made friends with that cute giraffe we named Mat-a-leo-ne. To the ballgames and to rock concerts. We had a ball, and partied till we'd run out of money. Then we found ways of earning more. The things that didn't cost anything were the best ones. (phone rings) (laughing) - Hi, Mom, how's California? - [Mom] Oh, it's great, honey. Uh, is Brad there? - Yeah, he just got home with Ira. They're probably gonna go fuck their brains out. - [Mom] Now, Howard, please. (chuckles) - It's gettin' kinda busy here. - Yeah. - Love you, too, Mom. - [Woman] Put it in, Howdy. Oh! - It feels so good. Slave girl, do what your master tells you! Sit! - Oh, Howdy. - What the fuck? - [Woman] It's big! (knocking) - Howdy, open up. - Howdy. - It's Howard, or Sir Howard to you. Howdy, Ira. - Howdy, Howdy. - The Love Motel is in full occupancy tonight. - [Woman] Howdy, I'm waiting. - Sorry, dude, front desk calling. - [Woman] Howdy! Deeper! (thumping instrumental music) - Morning. - Morning. - How did you sleep? - Good. - Good. I'm hungry, let's go dine al fresco. - I don't do three-ways. - [Brad Voiceover] Unfortunately, as time went by, I sensed that Ira got scared of love, commitments, and his own personal feelings, creating demons that will eventually reroute Ira into another path. A path where love is replaced with sex, and real intimacy turns into confusion. I could see dark clouds looming over our little paradise. But I tried to put a positive spin on it. Look at it as the glass being half-full. Ira. - Brad. - Now that you're out to your family, and my family already loves you. - [Ira] Yeah? - It'll be great, dude! It'll be like one big happy family, man. It's like barbecues, picnics, family functions. Doesn't that sound awesome? - Yeah. But I think we should take a little more time. - Time? I can be patient. Yeah. Hey, let's go for another jog again. I feel optimistically powerful. Come on! (gentle instrumental music) - What's up, Dad? What are you doin' up so late? - Hi, just came down for a smoke. How are you doing? - Great, so what's up? - Let's cut to the chase, Ira. You and Brad. You two are an item? - No. Me and Brad aren't just friends. I really care about him. But I kinda wanna experience a little before I settle down, Dad. I wanna play, and then maybe I'll decide. - Rule number one. Play safe. It's a new world. Not like when I was young. Be careful. I have a feeling Brad might be a bit disappointed. I have a feeling he had plans for the two of you. Okay, go shopping, see what gives, son. - I'm so excited. - Go! (pulsing rock music) ♫ It's all the men ♫ I turned 18 ♫ Proud and hung ♫ And lean and mean ♫ Dancin' for tips ♫ Is what I do best ♫ I play my way through school ♫ And pass all the tests ♫ Get down on your knees ♫ Follow good on time ♫ You know how to please ♫ Sex is not a crime ♫ Steak and cheese is a real delight ♫ Lingered thoughts of you last night - Dad, you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, Mom's asleep. How did it go? - Would you care for a cup of hot chocolate? Whipped cream. - That's good, that's good. - Oh, and some doughnut-- - I don't want doughnuts. How did it go? - It went too fast. It was good. But it was over in like 15 minutes. - Son, rule number two coming down. You can't hurry sex. It's all about taking your time. It's no fun when it's rushed. Like this hot chocolate. Go ahead, Ira, put it down like a drunken pirate with a bottle of whisky. Now, just take a sip, and let it settle on the taste buds. Easy does it. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Wipe your mouth. You look like a billboard ad. Oh, by the way, I went to the administration office at your school. The foreign exchange student department. We're going to have a guest here. A young boy from Dubai. I thought it would put a little spice into our waspy white American family. Besides, it's nice to visit people from other countries and learn how they live. - Dad, you didn't. - Why not? His name is Mansour, he seems like a nice guy. Now get to bed before your mother wakes up. - What's this, conspiracies against a weak and helpless mother? - No, Ira and I just had a small talk. Everybody to bed now. - Now you encourage him by inviting a young exotic vixen to stay with us? Like he doesn't have enough problems. - Accept it as the way it is. That's the way it is and you can't change it. - He can still change, he's still young. - You should change, and you are old enough. Good night, Shirley. - [Ira] Hey, Dad. - Hi. - Where's Mom? Is she okay? - I hope so. - Is it me again? - How was your first day at school? ♫ Straight boys, gay boys - [Brad Voiceover] I found out that Ira started seeing other boys. I didn't say a word, thinking it was a temporary, crazy teenage thing, and I was okay with it all, as long as his heart belonged to me, and that's where he'd always come back to. - [Man] Hey! ♫ That was years ago ♫ But I still hear ♫ The sound of the voice ♫ As my mom shed a tear - Why? Oh my God! ♫ Straight boys, gay boys - What big highways! Where I come from, we only have one. How do you say, uh, a street? - A lane? - Yes, lane. These look like something I saw in the movies. - [George] Yeah, we make 'em big here in the States. - I'm very excited. - Good. Did you leave a nice girlfriend back home? - [Mansour] Uh, no. - Did you have girlfriends? - Not really, Mr. Clarke. My father, he's very religious. How 'bout you, when you were young? - Oh yeah, lots and lots. - You must've been, uh, how do you say? Very, very horny. - I can't wait for Ira to meet you. - I'm sure we'll be buddies. - Yeah, that's the idea. ♫ Straight boys, gay boys ♫ They all know my name ♫ You treat them good ♫ And you treat them nice ♫ To me they're all the same (soaring rock music) - [Brad Voiceover] Something told me things will never be the same. As they disappeared into the house, I didn't even go in. It felt a bit awkward. - Okay. - [Brad Voiceover] I went home. - Mom, this is Mansour. He came all the way from Dubai to go to school here. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Clarke. - Are you married? - Mom. - Well, in those places, people marry at a very young age. I read that in National Geographic. - Shirley, some ice cold lemonade, please. It's hot out. - Okay. Okay, watch out for the wet floor. - I'll show you to your room. Hey, can we talk? - Garo to garo? - Something like that. - Are you (speaks foreign language)? - I hope not, sounds contagious. - That's what we call homosexuals where I live. - Oh. So, like, in Dubai, did you have a boyfriend? - Yes, we were together for 10 years. - [Ira] Oh, so you guys must've been like childhood friends. - Not exactly. It's very different over there. He was a married man with children, and we were dirt poor. But he was very kind to us. So I had a lot of gratitude and, and then we became lovers. - So where is he now? - Long story. As Mohammed said, nothing lasts forever. - Yeah, that's true. All right, well, I'll see you later, Mansour. Welcome aboard. - Ira, can I be frank? - I don't know, can you? - I think your dad is really sexy. Oh no, no, no, no, no, please, please, don't worry, I promise to behave. And I better go get ready before dinner. It's been a long, tiring plane ride and a long wonderful American shower is what the doctor ordered. (soaring rock music) (water splatters) Mr. Mansour, welcome to America. - [Woman] Hello! - [Woman] Did you already eat? - Here we are with a peace offering. It's not a real party without my famous Harvey Wallbanger cake. - Why thank you, you are now forgiven. We appreciate this. - That was sweet, Josephine. - Yes. I'd like for you to meet a new member of our family, Mr. Mansour. - Mansour, dear. - Oh, whatever. - Do you have relatives in Hezbollah? - No. - Josephine. - It's okay, have a seat, I'll get some coffee. - Coffee? - Regular. - Decaf. - I'll get two chairs. - Uh, no coffee. - Oh, no thank you. - [Shirley] Would you like anything else? - Uh, do you have tea? - Green? - Oh, please. - Here you go. - We'll both have decaf. - [Shirley] Very good, I'll be right there. - So, uh, what did you do, uh, where you come from? Did you work for a living? - I, I did. Um, I went to school to be a massage therapist so I could work in the tourist resorts. In Asia, it's a highly respectable profession. - [Shirley] It is that way here, too. But it depends. - Depends on what? - You should let me give you a massage sometimes. A group of German businessmen nicknamed me the Fountain of Youth. I can take all the stress away. - Thank you, I'll keep my stress. - I'll take it. It's been 100 years since anyone touched me. - Josephine, sometimes it's more about self-help. By the way, do you give, uh, prostate massages? (laughing) - Can we change the subject? Your prostate can wait, Mr. Craut. - Can it? - Further competition. - Wow, full house. - You met Mansour? Mansour, this is my best friend Mad Brad. - Hello, it is nice to meet you again, Mad Brad. - Good to see you, too. Just Brad's fine. - Mansour here is a masseuse. - Masseur. - [Mr. Craut] But he won't touch your prostate. - Okay. - Well. I really need to get going. Big day tomorrow with registration and all that stuff, but good night, and thank you all again. - Good night. - Good night. - Thank you. - Good night. - Good to see you again. So how's it goin'? (gentle instrumental music) - [Ira] Yeah. - [Brad] That Mansour, he's kinda cute. - Yeah, he seems like a good guy. (gentle instrumental music) - Oh, it's so beautiful out, isn't it? Oh, Ira. - Brad, I've been thinking. - About us, I hope. - Exactly. - Me too. All the time, actually. Ever since that night in paradise. God, I want a thousand of 'em. - [Ira] Brad, you need to chill a little. - What? Why, what do you mean? - Brad, I wanna see other guys. I'm young, I don't wanna be tied down with just anybody at this point. (gentle instrumental music) - But you, me, the other night? I see. It's cool, dude. It's gettin' late, I should probably go. - We're still friends. - I don't know, man, I need to digest this for a while. Happy shopping spree, Ira. I hope you find what you're looking for. (sad instrumental music) This was the last time I'd see Ira. - Brad! - For many years to come. (melancholic instrumental music) (knocking) - Hey, you wanna talk about it? Come on, man. I mean, a man is not a man unless he has cried a few tears. Do share your woes, beloved brother. Let your grief be known. - Fresh air feels good. Was Brad okay? - He's not okay. - My fucking life is over! My fucking heart's been broken into a million pieces and now I'm fucking alone, are you happy now? ♫ How do you mend a broken heart ♫ How can a loser ever win - [Brad] Howard, you rectal fungus. - Hey, I want my violin back! - [George] Want to talk about it? - Not tonight. - Manyana, son? - What are you still doing up? - Just getting ready for registration tomorrow. - Okay. Well have a good night, I'm bushed. ♫ Chat room lies and cyber sex ♫ All I want is just the facts ♫ Inches, seven, nearer nine ♫ Guaranteed a real hot time - Hey, you little luscious minx, I've been tryin' to get ahold of you all day. Yeah. Yeah, Brad's out. Wanna come over? Okay. I wanna fuck you like a zebra. - [Woman] Oh, Howdy. - Hi. Problems? I can smell them, you know. - Yeah, you have a good nose. I have a lot on my mind. - [Mansour] Lie on your stomach. - Thanks, thanks, thanks. Dude, I'm good. I'm good. - You're sure? - Yeah. - Your loss. - What's up, Dad, where's Mom? (sultry instrumental music) Have you seen Mansour? - [George] Not today. Remember, lesson number four, don't shit where you eat. - Ew! - Capisce? - [Ira] I think so. - Go. - Yes, sir. - Good morning, Vietnam. - Where is everybody? - Gone, I guess. - I must've overslept. Feels good, though. - Yeah, I bet. Want some breakfast? - You're a little grim this morning. - Well, grim begets grim. - Oh, Mom, hold on one second. - Where are you going? Finish your breakfast, come back. What is that? - [Ira] Look. - [Brad Voiceover] This was Ira's very last ditch attempt to ask his mother to accept her gay son, by showing her the bar reg and pointing out different important personalities. Needless to say, it didn't quite work. - That's gruesome, darling. Are you trying to tell me something? - You have to accept it, Mom. I gotta go, okay? (lush instrumental music) - Good morning, Mrs. Clarke. What a beautiful day. It becomes you so, Madam. What is wrong? - Nothing, Mansour, I don't wanna talk about it. - Just a little stressed. You like it? - I don't think you should be doin' this. Stop right now. - But it feels good, does it not? - I don't think that matters. - You know-- - Stop. - The apple doesn't fall far away from the tree. Like mother, like son. - How dare you! Now I said enough. (lush instrumental music) This might come as a bit of surprise to all, but I could use some time alone. Things have been a bit crazy for your dear simple mother, so please bear with me as I will be visiting my old school girlfriend Helen. I needed to take a bit of time to sort things out. So, my dear husband and son, please give me a few days, and I will be back with a new outlook. I hope. My family is very important to me. Love, Mom. (rhythmic instrumental music) - [Mansour] Hello. - Hello, Mansour. - What a day. Just got back from massaging Evan Stein. Really nice guy. Gave a nice tip. - Don't spend it all in one place. - I will save every penny. I feel so happy. I can break into song! - Do it, Mansour, express yourself, man. ♫ I feel pretty ♫ Don't feel shitty ♫ I feel pretty Don't quit your day job, Mansour. - So, where is Mrs. Clarke? - Visiting an old friend in Boston. - Ah. And Ira? - Out with a friend. - This is so much fun. - Isn't it? - It is. - My dad used to say the moon, when full, casts a spell that only lovers can feel. - Was your dad an astronaut? - No, but his forefather was an Indian chief. - Cherokee? - Apache. - Ah, the fearless warriors of the desert. Tell me more. - They used to hunt by night, stalk their prey, and kill and eat it! - [Ira] What do you say we get a little privacy? - That sounds like a good idea. - [Ira] Feel like a game of cowboys and Indians? (country-style instrumental music) - Better go take some pills. - Oh my. - Yeah, back injury form my construction work. - Sounds pretty bad. I have been known to cure back pain with these hands. - No, that's okay, Mansour. - I understand your apprehension. You can rest assured, I will be-- - [George] I'll take a rain check. - I'm like a chiropractor without a license. - Well, get your license first. I better go take care of the pills. Down more. Down, Mansour. Oh yeah. That's right, down. Oh. (moans) Yeah, that's right. That's the spot, man. - Better lay down right now. No argument, argue later. I prepared a very special set for us. - Oh, wow. (country-style instrumental music) - No need to be afraid of me, honey. I mean you no harm. Am I dressed to the limit? - Can I help you? - Looks to me like you need more help than I do. - [Mansour] Just relax. - Are you gonna box it good or not? You're makin' me crazier than I already am just lookin' at ya. - You wouldn't understand. - Try me. - It's too personal. - You wanna hear personal, you don't know what personal is, honey. - Don't worry. - [George] Okay. - I wasn't always like this. I had a home, a lovin' husband, and almost a beautiful baby. - Oh my. What happened? - I found out my husband was gay, and I left him for another man. - Oh. - You know, Mr. Clarke, I think you need more attention. - I was pregnant with his child at the time, and lost the baby to a coat-hanger. He killed himself when he heard the news. By that time, I was already livin' with another man. He just took off. Nobody wants a loser like me. - [Mansour] Do you still feel pain? - Yes, a lot, yes. - So here I am. I wish I woulda done things differently. - Thank you. You've helped me a lot, more than you can ever imagine. I gotta go. - Where ya goin'? - My family needs me. - You can write me at the station. Everybody knows Lucy! You may call me Lulu! (bittersweet instrumental music) - Taxi, taxi! 275 Elm Street. - Where? - [Shirley] 275 Elm Street. And hurry, my family needs me. (George moans) - Okay, calm down, darn it, lady. - [George] What are you doing? - [Mansour] It would be better if you took your shirt off. - Why? - It makes it easier. Don't worry. (stately instrumental music) Where I come from, they say I work miracles with my hands. (George moans) Just relax. - Okay. - I will be careful with your body. You want to get rid of this pain? - [George] Yeah, but I'll keep the pants. What do you want me to do next? - Take your pants off. - No, we've gone far enough. - Do you want to get rid of this pain or not? Just lift front from the table, and I'll pull them down from there. - Like this? - [Mansour] Exactly. (stately instrumental music) - Oh yeah. (moans) - [Mansour] Now turn around. - Oh, forget it. Let me just lie down like this and rest. - [Mansour] Turn around. - The front is doing fine, Mansour, it's just the back. - The back and the front are connected. Now turn around. - [George] Oh yeah. (George moans) I'm sorry if I got a bit excited. - It's a natural human reaction. I'm flattered, sir. - Don't get any ideas, Mansour. I'm a married man. - Yeah. (George moans) (stately instrumental music) (Mansour chuckles) (evil laughing) (Shirley grunts) (siren wails) (stately instrumental music) - The doctor will be out in just a minute. - Thank you. - I feel awful about what happened. I'm sorry, son. - You don't shit where you eat, Dad, huh? - Please, Ira, don't. - As soon as we get home, Mansour better be gone. - It's not his fault. - You think? Leonard, what are you doing here? - Don't ask. What are you doing here? Where's Shirley? - [George] I feel awful, son. - I'm here for a prostate exam. - Yeah, the doctor'll see you right away. - Okay, thank, oh. Who knows, maybe I'll get lucky. - Good afternoon, I'm Dr. French. She'll be okay. John will bring her out in a moment. Have her take two of these once a day, and have her get plenty of rest. I'll see her again in two weeks. John will make the appointment. - Thank you. - Let me know if there's anything else you need. - Thank you. - Here she is, isn't she lovely? - Mom. - Hi, baby. - It's over. - Oh, it is. - Shirley, are you okay? - The doctor wants to see her again in two weeks. Just keep the wheelchair and just bring her back at her next appointment. All right, same time? - I'll get it, you get the door. - Ah, fresh air. It feels wonderful. - Dad, get the car. - I'll be right over. - I got it. (Mansour mutters angrily) - [Brad Voiceover] It was only natural for Monsour to come and try to commiserate with me. (knocking) (pulsing techno music) - Ooh, nice. - Howdy, what are you doing? - Fixin' some shit, man. I feel sexy. - [Brad] All right, little man, take this I'm too sexy number and go upstairs. - I'm too sexy for my ass, too sexy for my arms, too sexy for my cock, my big fat juicy cock. - [Brad] Go! (pulsing techno music) He would come by a few more times and tell me he ran into Ira. The two would just exchange a few pleasantries and then go about their day. Yeah, he broke my heart, Monsour. But I'll live. - Oh, stupid Ira. How could he let something like this go? You deserve so much better. - You know, it's getting late. I think it's time that you go. - [Monsour] Don't worry. - I said it's getting late. I think it's time that you go. - It's a little too late for that! - Dude, it's late. I said it's time to go. - Not so fast. I gave you a lot of current information about Ira. Your sweet Ira. - I didn't ask for any of it. Now go before I drop this hammer on you. (pulsing techno music) I wonder what it is that makes people think, after they've been dumped, there still might be interest. Unwilling to accept the bitter reality, they cling to some hope, a thin silver lining, so elusive, so untrue. (knocking) Leave me alone, Howdy. - Come on, just two minutes. I promise not to say anything rude, Brad. Ira? Can I tell ya something, big brother? Remember Mr. Fontana? You know, the jerk who owned Arnold's next door. - Yeah. - Well he told me something that kinda stuck with me. And, like, remember when I wouldn't leave his daughter Nancy alone? I'm, I just, I couldn't take no for an answer, and he said something that really saved my life that night. - [Brad] What did he say? - He said that you can't make someone be interested in you. They either are or they aren't. And if they aren't, even getting sad about it's just a waste of time. The only thing to do is to move on. - Yeah, you're right. Time to move on. (gentle instrumental music) (knocking) Mr. Clarke. - Brad. Hope you don't mind. - No, not at all. Come on in. Would you like some tea or a beer or somethin'? - Just water, please. - Okay. (percussive instrumental music) Here ya go. - Thank you. - And where are you going? - I'm going to practice with a gay band. Appropriate? - [Brad] Very. - Bye, Howard. - Bye, Mr. Clarke. Say hi to wife and kids, toodaloo. - So how are things? - Well, where do I start? - Monsour just stopped by. I know. - I see. Actually, it's the worst thing that could've happened. Actually, nothing happened. I am supposed to be an example, and look at me. Ira's not wrong for resenting me. I feel I've lost my son. My only reason to live. - He'll be back. You made a mistake. Besides, you've always been like a father to me. Maybe I can be your son for a while? I can use some of that, too. - Thanks, Brad. I've always considered you one of my own. - [Brad Voiceover] We started spending some time together. He told me about the goings-on, and I shared with him my thoughts and experiences. By now, he came by regularly. Hey, Mr. Clarke. - Hi there, poker buddy. - [Brad] How's it goin'? Every Monday, we'd play cards while I'd serve a sandwich and he would recount the current affairs. (laughing) - Oh. - Eventually, Mrs. Clarke was getting up in her years and needed some help. She contacted an old friend she met that one night at the train station. As the story goes, Mrs. Clarke invited Lulu to move in in exchange for some of the housework. They all seemed to love her. She was so funny and told lots of jokes. That crazy woman loved imitating Zelda Rubinstein, the small, eccentric medium from Poltergeist. - There's a terrible presence in this house. So much rage, so much betrayal. - [Shirley] You make me laugh. - [Brad Voiceover] The two found great comfort in entertaining each other, which left poor Mr. Clarke even more isolated. Seasons came and left as the Clarkes readjusted to their new reality, but it was Mrs. Clarke's weak heart that gave up first. (sad piano music) - Lulu, make me laugh one more time. Please. So my family can see me smile. - Oh, Shirley, you're gonna be just fine. - Please. Do a Zelda. One more time. - Go ahead, Zelda, give it a shot. - There is no death. It is only a transition to a different sphere of consciousness. Cross over, children. All are welcome. Go to the light. There is peace and serenity in the light. - Thank you. (dramatic instrumental music) (weeping) (dramatic instrumental music) - [Brad Voiceover] Mr. Clarke never remarried and it was well understood, and as he explained to me that very last time I saw him. You think you'll ever remarry? - Oh no, it's not in my plans. I'll probably be coming out when I'm 75, and that's a relief. (gentle instrumental music) - [Brad Voiceover] Nothing ever stays the same and everybody was sort of checking out of the old family scene. For the first time ever, that swinging porch chair that was the embodiment of closeness and love seemed empty. Later on, in the military, I had an Army therapist tell me that when bombs fall, they fall in clusters. The next one came from a totally unexpected place. - I'm gonna miss you, babe. Guess what, I'm joining the Peace Corps. - What? - Yeah, I'm leaving soon. - When? - Friday, Friday at noon. It's an afternoon flight. - To where? - Well first we're going to the Congo and then Sudan and then Darfur. - Oh, why? - You know, it sounds kinda corny but I was looking at myself in the mirror one morning and the person in the mirror kinda looked back at me and said, "Howard, it's time you start "doing something with yourself, "making something of your life, "doing some good in the world," so, I mean, people do this kind of thing all the time. I'll write often. - You better. - And I don't care if you call me Howdy. I don't care. (gentle instrumental music) - [Brad Voiceover] It was the end of an era. And I decided to mark it with an introspective, cross-country drive through the Southwest, a land known for its spirituality. I was still looking for answers, but instead I found myself eroticizing of past fantasies, especially that one night after that coming out birthday party. It became one long haunting memory. - Wow. (giggling) (gentle instrumental music) - [Brad Voiceover] Huh, I still remember Josephine's humorous coaxing at that wonderful 18th birthday party. - You should go, Ira, and have a ball. San Francisco is for you guys what Jerusalem is for the Jews. - Or Mecca for Muslims. - Some day. - [Brad Voiceover] Ira always liked that metaphor. He took that offer and made San Francisco his new home. I was sort of glad he was far away. Out of sight, out of mind they say. Myself, I met a nice newly divorced lawyer and settled down with him in a condo in Evanston. (brooding instrumental music) Hey, babe, you look good. - [Lawyer] Hey. - How was work. - Brutal. I don't even wanna talk about it. Just had to see ya. - What do you wanna do tonight? - Oh, you know what? I just wanna change my clothes and chill out and relax. Sound okay? - Sounds great. - All right, great. Oh no, another one, no, yes. - Refill. (phone rings) - Just let it ring. (phone rings) (phone rings) - [Brad Voiceover] Thanks for callin', this is Brad and Jimmy. Leave a message and we'll get right back to you. (beeping) - [George] Oh, okay, you're not home. Seems like a long time since we've talked. Call if you want to get together. So long. - You haven't talked to him in a while. What's it been, like a year? - Has it? - Ira. It's still Ira, isn't it? (tense instrumental music) - Ira? I don't think so. It's not in the cards. You're safe. - It'll always be Ira. But try to love me, if you can. This isn't the Heartbreak Hotel. - Good song. After a while, Ira's dad stopped calling and I didn't call either. Through the grapevine called Miss Foozie, I heard that Ira had become a permanent fixture in the nightlife of that crazy city. - [Announcer] Miss Foozie, let's hear it for Miss Foozie. (cheers) - [Brad Voiceover] Miss Foozie was a local entertainer who moved to the Bay Area about the same time Ira did, and kept in touch, just all too happy to let me know the very latest gossip. - Gimme a dance, come on! (cheers) ♫ Beauty school drop-out (cheering and shouting) - [Brad Voiceover] From what I heard, he found a new boyfriend, some pre-med student from Berkeley. They both seemed to enjoy the scene. Time flies when you're having fun. Between the drinks, the one-night stands, the drugs, and the men, the old happy-go-lucky Ira I once knew was replaced by a new, somewhat darker Ira, escaping into a series of one-night stands and mindless cruising, the nemesis of gay life. He had friends. Fair-weather friends, who were there for the good times and were gone when the money and booze ran out. As the years passed, extended tricks became boyfriends. Boyfriends became extended tricks. Eventually, he lost his job and the money ran out. And Ira started resorting to more adventurous ways of earning a living. (staccato instrumental music) - What are you doing? - [Painter] I just love you. - [Brad Voiceover] It was only a matter of time before things would go from bad to worse. - Here ya go, beautiful. Have a good night. - God bless you. - [Brad Voiceover] About the same time, I accidentally ran into George Clarke as I was jogging with a neighborhood friend. He seemed lonely and sad and it bothered me. Although I didn't let him know, it bothered me a lot. Jimmy was long gone, and I was single again. (light instrumental music) I invited George Clarke, hoping to hear some news about Ira, and what has happened to him. (phone rings) - Hello? - Mr. Clarke? Hi. - Brad. So good to hear your voice. (knocking) - [Brad] George. How are you? - Good, how are you? - [Brad] Good. Welcome, thanks for coming. - Thanks. - Go ahead and have a seat. I'm almost done with the table, George. I invited Mr. Clarke for a card game and a Monte Cristo club sandwich, his favorite. I'm almost done with the sandwich, then we can talk. - Okay. - The Monte Cristo was one of them period sandwiches from the '70s, an item that seemed to have disappeared from all menus. Mr. Clarke seemed to live in the past. That is all he had. - God, I haven't seen one of those in years. - [Brad] Your favorite. Some wine? - Little bit, yeah. (George grunts) Wow. Pickle? - No, it's all yours. (laughs) Salut. - Salut. - When Ira was very young, I thought he'd be interested in sports. So we played lots of baseball, and I just knew it wouldn't happen. But he's very athletic. One of the best gymnasts in his class. Is it true, gymnasts tend to be more gay than baseball players? Oh, Ira. I bet you blame me for killing your mother. (melodramatic instrumental music) I have to go home. - You should go see him. - He's not expecting me. - Surprise him. (melodramatic piano music) - Hang on, John, I have another call. Hello? - [George] Hey, son, how's life? - Uh, good, Dad, real good. - [George] Uh, do you have a minute for your old man? - Uh, yeah. Um, hang on a second. John, I have to call you back. - [John] That's the last straw, man. - Don't do this. - Good bye. - Stop it! I'll, I'll call you later. Hello? - Ira? - Yeah, Dad. - I'm in San Francisco. All the hotel rooms are taken. Would it be okay if I stayed with you, son? - Uh, yeah, Dad. I, I wouldn't have it any other way. - I'm right outside your door. (knocking) Seems like no time has passed. - Come in, come in. (peaceful instrumental music) - You think I forgot, didn't you? I am not that old. - Dad, that's my job. - Oh, shut up and open it. - God, he was cute. - [George] Still is. - How do you know? - I just ran into him the other day in Lincoln Park. - Really? Brad, say hi to Ira. - Yeah, Ira, long time, no see. Hope you're doin' well and havin' a great time in 'Frisco. - Come on, Brad, let's go. - [Brad] Ciao. Mr. Clarke, good seeing you. We should talk. Time seemed to fly, and it was back to Chicago for Mr. Clarke. Back to a big, empty house. Back to the bars for Ira. I was alone as well. So it was back to Mr. Clarke, as we both found comfort in spending time together. (phone rings) - Hey, Dad. - Hi, Ira. Yeah, doing fine. Don't worry, I am not that alone. One gets used to it. Besides, Lucy still comes over and takes care of things. Don't worry, I'm not that alone. Sounds like a big party. Go easy on the men. Time to settle down. - Wait, what? Nah, I'm, I'm just hangin' out. - I love you. - Well, I can't, I can't hear you. - I love you. - I'll, I'll call you later. - [George] Sounds like one big party. - Yeah. Some things just never change. How's he doin'? - [George] Seemed good. - Happy? - Seems happy, yeah. Quiet but happy. - That's good. I'll go 10. - I'll see your 10 and raise you five. - All right, I'll see your five. What have ya got? - [George] Eights and aces. - Ooh. Dead man's hand. You win. I better go. - You have time for one more hand. - Ira's gonna be callin' back. I'll stop back by though. If you need anything, just give me a shout. - Okay. - Thanks, I had a good time. - Glad to see you again. - [Brad] Yeah, you too. Had a good time. - Me, too. - Thank you. - Thank you. - [Brad] I'll come back by in two weeks, same time? - Good. - Okay. - Good. Call first. - Call first? Okay. I'll see you in two weeks. Bye. - Bye. (dramatic instrumental music) (phone rings) - Dad, it's Ira, hi. Um, listen, I made all the arrangements, and I'm coming home. No, no arguments this time. Okay? - Ira. (dramatic instrumental music) Wish I could've picked you up, son. I'm getting old. - Daddy, that's why I came home. - You've got good taste. Listen, son, I'm not gonna be around forever. - [Ira] Dad, stop it. - No, really. That's the way it is. I have one more thing to tell you. - [Brad Voiceover] In the next couple of weeks, Ira and his father seemed closer than ever. Maybe 'cause they knew that time was not on their side, as George was getting old rapidly, almost on a daily basis. It was almost like he was waiting for Ira to have come back into his life so he can depart in peace, leaving his son one, very heartfelt and lasting legacy. - It's the people you have known all your life that are the important ones. You might meet a lot of people, some good, some bad, some will make you laugh for a moment or two, and some will get to you in other ways. But nothing, nothing takes the place of family and lifetime friends. - Dad. - Oh, Ira, to have had you as a son, what a gift. - Dad, no! Anyone? Dad. - [George] I miss you already. - Dad! (sad instrumental music) (phone rings) (phone rings) - Mr. Clarke? Hey, Mr. Clarke, it's Brad. I just wanted to make sure we were still on for this weekend. Give me a call back. (phone rings) George, I didn't hear from you all week. I'm getting worried. I'm gonna go ahead and pick up some groceries and stop by this afternoon anyway. I'll see you soon, bye. Mr. Clarke? Hey, your door's open. Mr. Clarke? Hey, Mr. Clarke? Hey, Mr. Clarke? I picked up some fresh groceries. And I grabbed your favorite beer. Let me pick up a little bit, and I'll go ahead and, uh, make us some sandwiches before we play cards. Tonight, it's my turn to win. I can feel it in my bones! (sad instrumental music) He was a good man. - The best. Best man. (weeping) (sad instrumental music) A day that's gone by, I haven't stopped thinking about you. Mad Brad. - It's like no time's passed at all. - Yeah. Maybe a little quieter this time around, though. - [Brad] Unfortunately. I'll take my 1,001 nights. - I thought it was only 1,000. - I added an extra for early withdrawal. (chuckling) (gentle instrumental music) - [Lulu] Good morning, sweetheart. - Morning. - [Lulu] This is unusually early for you. - Well, you know what they say. The early bird catches the worm. (gentle instrumental music) You okay? - Hmm. - See ya later. (gentle instrumental music) - [Brad Voiceover] Our long journey has come to an end. You might be wondering are we happy now after all that? As for me, I don't know what happy is. I know I found closure. (gentle instrumental music) I know I'm upset about all the time wasted. Happy? Content is a better word. Besides, who's happy anyways? Are you? (spacey instrumental music)
