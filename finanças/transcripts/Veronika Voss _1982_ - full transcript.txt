Robert Krohn You're very kind, Mr Krohn Shall we sit down? There are seats free at the front - No Let's stay here! Please! People would recognize me, understand? They'd stare at me and talk about me Some might even want to start a conversation Do you understand? Yes, I understand Thank you very much It's the phone For you My God Why don't you drink your beer instead of spilling it all over? Hasberg here To hear at night things that were never heard: No He's asleep the hundredth name of Allah, the drumbeat not noted down when Mozart died. When? Where? Conversations apprehended in the womb. Yes, I'll tell him Thanks Good-bye A woman wants to meet you for tea this afternoon 5:00 at the Privilege A Mrs Voss I don't know her She obviously doesn't know you either She said what a charming man you were - Your health, sir - Thank you You're a sports reporter That must be exciting Sometimes People who fight are always exciting Victories are exciting Defeats - What do you fight for? - Me? Yes Tell me about your triumphs My life's pretty humdrum, you know No victories No defeats anymore Was that your wife on the phone? My girlfriend Do you love her? Do I love her? We get along Robert? I may call you Robert? - Of course I'm sure you felt bad - Felt bad? - For not recognizing me You didn't recognize me immediately, did you? No, not at once You see! You can't fool me Let me tell you, it was a joy for me that someone should take care of me without knowing I'm Veronika Voss, and how famous I am I felt like a human being again A human being The movies are not reality, of course Waiter! The lighting here is terrible Please light the candles and turn that off Certainly, madam Thank you Light and shadow: The two secrets of motion pictures Did you know that? I don't go to the movies much You can study it on me Do you think I'm a beautiful woman? Yes, very beautiful I think you're a very beautiful woman A woman with both light and dark sides Do you have 300 marks? - 300 marks? - I saw a brooch - Yes, I think so Such a cute little brooch And when I want something, I have to have it - Here you are - Thank you You will wait for me? I want a brooch for 300 marks My God, hurry up Any brooch for 300 marks That can't be so difficult How about How about this one, madam? It costs almost 300 marks 285 to be precise Guess who it is Am I a mysterious stranger, or? Your beer, sir No, you'd never guess I'll guess who you are You're a man who has ordered a beer, because over a beer he can consider whether he should cheat on his girlfriend with a mysterious lady Am I right? No, don't say anything You wouldn't tell the truth anyway Waiter! No, please This is on me The rest is for you It was marvelous getting to know you I must be going now I have an appointment with my producer My movie producer You know how it is He made his first million with me Now he's after his second I don't really want to make another picture yet, but I can't refuse him It's a pretty brooch, don't you think? It's a dream role What should I do? And the part's good, too My husband wrote the screenplay Obviously, he writes only good parts for me You must come and visit us sometime But I must run now Good-bye, Robert You may call me Veronika Good-bye, Veronika Why are you staring at me, you slob? Veronika, darling! What's wrong? Aren't you feeling well? Pratorius! No, I feel fine The man it was meant to please didn't like it The man it was meant to please didn't like it What should I do with a brooch that doesn't serve its purpose? You see? You can't say So give me my money back Maybe you didn't understand me Veronika Voss I recognized your voice immediately I can't tell you how delighted I am Of course Miss Voss can have her money back You remember? 1944, I think it was In Berlin Yes, I remember, but the movie was shot in 1943 The premiere was canceled, and I had bought this lovely fur for it I remember it as if it were yesterday Your husband was so nervous about the air raids He was proven right in the end Two months later I was bombed out of my store I managed to rescue your picture, but in the rush, you forgot to autograph it Even so, it was a lovely time Every time is lovely I'm making a new picture soon I'll give you an up-to-date photo when I have one I would be very pleased And I'll buy my jewelry for the premiere from you I hope my husband's not so nervous and we don't forget the autograph I'll make sure myself My regards to your husband Three hundred marks for a cocktail I think I'll become a con woman, too What was that? ...fight with all our might... against the war treaties of the Eisenhower government and Adenauer's allies. Is she attractive? Yes Did you say something? 1951, 1950, 1949 I told you, her best time was during the war, with UFA She had something going on with Goebbels, I think Wrong Goebbels barred her from acting - Nonsense She was his protegee She made one movie after another But after the war she claimed the opposite, and the culture vultures believed her Where did you get that from? - The culture vultures - You see They're blind Actors are stupid, dishonest and vain The culture vultures are - Since when do you talk to them? I'm interested in the arts Bull What do you want from Voss? She's no good at soccer Maybe I want to go out with her, for a drink, or- More like the latter She hasn't made a movie in three years You'd make a good pair at the bar You mean she drinks? All actors drink And when they don't have any work, they hit the bottle It's a law of nature Her marriage is finished, too Is that true, or just gossip? Another law of nature, my boy: The gossip you hear about an actor is always true Because they're stupid, dishonest and vain Exactly Thanks, Grete If I can do you a favor anytime Not likely Sports are always about the winners, and I'm interested in the losers You wouldn't have Voss' address, by any chance? She's one of your losers I'm only interested in them as long as they're losing, not after they've lost Ask her agent Karla Petrowitsch, 240533 - Thanks Excuse me Could you answer a question? Why should we, young man? Don't be mean, Jenny He asked very politely They are polite nowadays, that's true But that's no reason to forgive them everything Are you looking for someone? Yes A Miss Voss I was given this address, but - People sometimes change their addresses, young man, without informing those who might be looking for them Perhaps they don't wish to be found There are people who try to make their lives a mystery Believe me, young man Oh, I believe you And thanks for the "young man" We are old, and you are young, and old folks know all the secrets the young have yet to discover What do you think, Jan? Should we help him? I think so He was so polite Inquire there If anyone knows people's secrets besides us old folks, it's the doctors And especially that kind of doctor Good-bye, young man NEUROLOGIST BYAPPOI NTMENT ONLY By appointment only The sign downstairs is quite clear I just wanted to know if a Miss Voss lives here Get lost Who? Veronika Voss - I don't know her - Okay Thanks What do you want anyway? Who are you? I'm a reporter Why didn't you say you weren't a patient? Please come in - Thanks Have a seat I'll tell the doctor there's a reporter here The doctor will see you now This way, please It won't take too long? - I don't think so Yes Miss Voss is one of my patients But that's all I can tell you You understand? Did you want to write a story about her? She owes me 300 marks I'd like them back, that's all And how did you happen to come to me? That's a professional secret You make it sound so ominous No need to fear It's not really a secret Just a manner of speaking More a coincidence really - That's reassuring Any famous actress has good reason to keep her address secret Yes, and so does a debtor Artists are different from us ordinary people They're wrapped up in themselves, or simply forgetful Not as attentive to detail as you and I Though in money matters, Miss Voss is very correct, to my knowledge I'm sure you have nothing to worry about That's reassuring Thank you, Dr Katz You've been very helpful Good-bye If you need money, you can ask me, can't you? Whatever you need, you must ask me, mustn't you? We don't want someone like that coming between us, do we? I'm your best friend, aren't I? Whether Mr. Pratorius is really in a meeting orjust told me to say he's in a meeting is neither here nor there, Miss Voss In the past, I would have smacked you one for your impertinence That wouldn't have been necessary In the past, you'd have gotten an appointment Don't take it so personally He wants a different type for the role A completely different type of person Veronika What a surprise! Why didn't you call first? I phoned three times You weren't here Nonsense Of course I was here, but - But? I wanted you for the part, but the director- You know how directors are today They do what they like with you He insisted on his floozy - Is that her? Yes Very attractive And much younger than me Less talented, too If it were up to me - Does she have a mother? In the movie, I mean Yes Why? Let me play her mother The mother of the floozy Please Let me It's a tiny role Two or three days' shooting I'd never have dared offer you something like that That's why I have to ask What are you doing here? - Picking you up from work - You've never picked me up before You never thought another woman was more beautiful than me I said "beautiful," not "more beautiful" Are you writing letters to each other? "Drained of memory, I was five glass spheres, devoid of foliage or prospect Yesterday would have been a good day to die Today, the devil take the hindmost" It's a nice poem, Robert But so sad How many times have I told you not to read my poems? Besides, they're shit! - Stop it! Here "Dear Mr Krohn, Enclosed is the small sum you kindly lent me I'll be away for some weeks, or I'd have returned it personally Sincerely yours, Veronika Voss" Doesn't sound very intimate She could have signed it herself, couldn't she? If she'd been gracious enough Was Mr Krohn exaggerating somewhat in describing his rendezvous? Did you want me to pick you up from the office and invite you to dinner? Who knows? Your plan succeeded But as punishment, you can invite me to dinner If they played for 1860 Munich, I wouldn't have to get up so early But they don't play for 1860 They play for Kaiserslautern What I don't understand is why they're both called Walter, although they're brothers Not "although" Because they're brothers It's perfectly natural - You're driving me crazy If they're brothers, they should have different names One would be Fritz and the other Walter That's what I said: Otmar and Fritz And Walter? Then you have to do three interviews? As you say With Otmar, Fritz and Walter You're quite right, my dear This staircase lighting isn't very flattering for women Don't you agree, Miss von Hasberg? Robert, you do have a car? Yes Why? I want to spend this night with you But my house is in Starnberg That's why Men always have to ask why Don't they? Isn't your husband here? Would I have come here to be alone with you if he were? It was to have been our first vacation together in years Then this telegram arrives from my producer But a contract's a contract There's nothing you can do So my husband's alone on Capri I could try to screw in the fuses No, please don't Leave the candlelight He's like that When we go away, the furniture has to be covered, the shutters closed, and the electricity turned off It's like people who know they're dying and have to put everything in order first Do you have idiosyncrasies like that? No I don't think so And you? Me? I like to seduce defenseless men You are a defenseless man, aren't you? Darling, turn that awful radio off! I'm listening to the news lf, in the present war, the old balance of power can be retained... We don't need news here anymore The war can't reach us here Play some nice music Just for us Please The former is only feasible and can only function if Germany does not fight for itself alone but wins this struggle on behalf of all of of Europe. And turn off the light, please It's always the same crap You always have to be doing something, always setting something up Can't we just be the way we are? Why don't you understand me? When an actress plays a woman who wants to please a man, she tries to be all the women in the world rolled into one And she needs music and light And liquor and pills Yes, why not? Liquor and pills, too Haven't you had anything to drink? Oh, come on Sure, I have But there's a big difference between my drinking and yours I drink to turn off You drink to give yourself a boost To make yourself big, beautiful, seductive, unique My vase My vase is smashed What are you doing in my house? You smashed my vase! You want to destroy my house! You want to destroy my life! Don't touch me I don't know you I'm Robert You're Veronika We slept together I need a doctor I'm sick You must drive me back to town Now Quickly, please We'll leave at once Can you dress yourself? I'm in pain That's all The vase - You must buy a new one The same one No 5 Gabrielstrasse The man's name is Treibel But don't tell him where you got the pieces from Don't even show them to him Promise me you won't When you have it, take it to my house and put it in the same place Here are the keys You will go now Maybe she's not there Or she won't open the door She will be there She's been my doctor for many years I know her She will let me in Please go now I won't go in until you leave I'll call you Thank you for everything How many pills have you taken? So tired Bitter You think these pills help you, don't you? - Bitter - Yes, they are bitter You can remember that Come on, quickly Why is that man waiting outside? What man? I don't know any man I'll believe you because you promised me Me, your best friend I am your best friend, aren't I? Yes, you are my best friend Help me In a moment First you must cough up those pills Then we'll give you a shot You must spit up all those bitter pills first You don't want to die, do you? You may die only when I say so The doctor asks if you'd like to join her for breakfast She loves this room It gives her strength "My refuge," she calls it Does she live - I mean, is she here often? In emergencies, when the pain becomes unbearable Or maybe I should say- Take a seat Maybe I should say when she fears it will become unbearable Do you understand? What kind of pain is it? Psychosomatic or physical? With nervous disorders, it doesn't make much difference Real or imagined, the pains simply exist for the person who feels them Do you think this illness is curable? In Miss Voss' present condition, it's impossible to say She told me she plans to make a new movie soon Maybe that will help her But it could also harm her We just don't know At least you've seen her now Otherwise you might think I was keeping her hidden from you Or was even going to bump her off in the end Taste good? Thank you What I've told you is, of course, not for publication Of course not "Off the record," as we say Very good I must be going Thanks a lot What a shame Let me ask you a question Is your interest in Miss Voss of a purely professional nature, or are other motives involved? Believe it or not, I'm not sure myself - Good-bye - Thank you Say are you spying on me? Not on you On her How did you know? I've lived with a journalist long enough A sports reporter, by the way Damn it! Otmar, Fritz and Walter will be mad at you - Otmar and Fritz Walter - Whatever They'll be mad Did you have a nice night? I don't know Are you in love with her? I don't know What do we do now? Buy a vase Always finish what you start Understand? One way or another - No What do you mean, "no"? I don't understand you It doesn't exactly look like a housewares store Your new lover has expensive taste The woman's crazy, I tell you, and you're headed down the same path! Don't shout I know him Great Maybe you'll get a discount I mean, I've seen him before Outside that house My God, it's all so complicated I agree No, I don't agree at all I'll go in and buy a vase for my boyfriend's lover Should it be the same or something special? Like this one It has to be just like it But he mustn't find out where you got the pieces Say you found them or something Found them I just happened to find them - Or it's for one of your girlfriends One of my girlfriends That's good I must remember that Heaven sends an angel to try me Do we deserve this trial, Jenny? At least we can pass it with dignity Tell our mutual lady friend that we have carefully counted the stones of this house, and that we know which ones still belong to us All I wanted was - Take the vase and go It is precious Handle it with care Does that frighten you, my angel? It is more precious than a human being And still I shall not ask for more than a moment of bliss Is everything else here just as cheap? I beg you For you, there are many paths to happiness But not for me I have only- Please Tell our lady friend he has kept account of the joy that is still due him, and we know there are only a few pages left in the book Allow me to open the door to your world My world is the world of dreams Tell our friend I long for her final benevolent act Let me show you something What is it? Treblinka Didn't our friend tell you? I see she keeps her vow of confidentiality Do you understand now why I want nothing to do with your world? My angel What now? I don't know What I don't understand is why he thought I came from that doctor when the vase belongs to that damned Voss woman Oh, I'm sorry I mean your Veronika I don't know Did your newspaper fire you? You don't know Do me a favor? Take the vase to her house Why not? I've always wanted to see what a movie star's villa is like Ex-movie star What if she's there? She won't be there Why don't you go there yourself? You could smell her undies again I'm sorry I must get to the office Work must go on And how do things go on with us? You don't know I've been chasing a story But not in Kaiserslautern We've known each other a long time, haven't we? My God Don't start with that I just wanted to say I'm on to a story and that you can trust me There's nothing about trust in your contract It says you're responsible for sports, not movies It also says that in exceptional cases - Upon prior consultation with your editor That's what I'm doing now Don't be so uptight! It's a story about aging movie stars, once in the limelight but now in the shadows You know, UFA and all that I specifically told you - What? Who? For Robert? I'll have a word with her myself first Your story's chasing after you Hello, ma'am It's wonderful to hear your voice My name's Borsoy I'm the managing editor I was introduced to you years ago at a movie gala You won't remember me but I certainly remember you I beg your pardon? Oh, yes I'll give him to you But a word of warning: The man's a lady-killer What's that? That was very good My regards, ma'am Hello Hello, Miss Voss How are you? Thanks Me, too Of course I'd be interested Where? Bavaria Studios, stage 3 Okay I'll be there Thanks for your call Good-bye, Miss Voss "Good-bye, Miss Voss" That's no way to speak to a movie star Not even a former one Wouldn't you rather let the people from the arts page handle it? No Have it your way Find out what's really behind this psychiatric clinic Isn't it because her husband left her? How do I know why they put an actress in a mental institution? Am I writing the story or you? I am Is that the unit manager? Veronika Voss speaking I beg your pardon? Oh, that doesn't matter I wanted to ask when the car will be here The car to pick me up, naturally Oh, I see No car Spare me the sermon! I know I'm not the leading lady Thanks, you smart-ass! Where's the key? - What key? - Give it to me at once! Does he have it? By mistake He put it in his pocket by mistake He has the key to my house? It's not your house Not yet No? I'm still alive And I'm going to work again Two days' shooting Don't be ridiculous When are you seeing your lover again? During shooting Very well Afterwards, you'll hand the key over to me Understand? Yes And you'll never see him again Is that clear? That's my business Is it? Then I'll have to inform him myself about your business If you do that - Yes What then? Robert will stand by me Of course Men are just crazy about women addicts You need a shot for your comeback? - Naturally I thought so And how do you intend to pay for it? From my salary Besides, I still have my jewelry Your jewelry? Maybe I don't like your jewelry I won't need a shot I'll make it without Maybe I'll never need another shot, or you either I see It seems all my patients are deserting me today Wait here a moment, or there'll be such a crowd in the waiting room My God, are you still here? I told you no Please I've done all I could for your husband Now it's up to him to do something Please She's right, Jenny When you've read a book to the end, it's time to close it It was a lovely book, Dr Katz Good-bye, then Okay, folks Quiet, please We're shooting Okay, folks Quiet, please We're shooting Blue Skies, 336, take 11 Action Wait a moment Your tip Cut Not enough tears, huh? Shouldn't we use glycerine? No, no I have my pride It'll be okay this time Let's hope so And once more Quiet, please We're shooting Blue Skies, 336, take 12 Action I'm sorry I wasn't concentrating Doesn't matter We'll do it again Once more Quiet, please We're shooting Blue Skies, 336, take 13 Action Wait a tip Your moment Cut The tears were right this time The tears were right, but the lines were wrong We'll do it with glycerine this time, Miss Voss Believe me, it has the same effect, and you can concentrate on the scene Once more - Makeup - Yes? Glycerine drops Quiet, please! Unit manager, see that all those not involved leave the set SI LENCE Oh, my God! - She needs a doctor - She needs a special doctor Here's the address - Who are you? I'm a screenwriter And I was her husband once Do you understand me? Do you understand me? No How can I understand you? I love her Ah, I see You love her Then there's nothing one can do Exactly For one night of bliss, I would give everything Although - - What? I just thought, if you were to find another woman, for example Any woman It must be possible to find a girl Cheers I already have one You do? You already have one? Then there's nothing one can do There's nothing one can do Exactly! She'll be your downfall There's nothing you can do about it She'll destroy you, because she's a pitiful creature Because she's an addict Maybe she'll be up here, or down there Who can say? That stuff costs a fortune And when she can no longer pay, she won't get anymore, and she'll be dead Dead as a doornail It's terrible but it has its logic You mean this doctor takes her money? What do you think? Do you think her health insurance pays for it? For morphine? Where are you going? Stay here Stay here Where are you going? I'm going to save her I won't let them destroy her Good luck, my friend All the best Let me see her or I'll kick the door in! I'll call the police! You're holding a woman captive here! Marianne, he's drunk! What you're doing is trespassing That may be But what you're doing is murder Your mind's confused, Mr Krohn Maybe it is What's that you're going to give her? Morphine Morphine! Then it's true! Do you want me to let her die in agony? I thought you loved her Give me your hand, dearest You've been drinking beer, haven't you? You wanted to help me Safe haven in a storm Kiss me Go now You can't help me She will help me Please excuse me I'll overlook it, Mr Krohn, because your emotions are confused, but your mind is, too You should get informed about the use of opiates Surely that's the duty of a journalist: To be informed Mr Treibel, may we? Why are you screaming, miss? They've both found the peace they sought for so long I knew it yesterday evening when they asked me to make them a cup of tea with honey They often said they wanted to take the pills with tea and honey Because the pills are so bitter They wanted to leave the world with a sweet taste, they said, not a bitter one Did you call a doctor? Yes, as soon as I found them Dr Katz? No Not Dr Katz Dr Katz treated their nervous disorder They're not suffering from nerves anymore, are they? You should still inform her that the house and everything here now belong to her How do you know? You didn't know Mr Treibel, did you? No But I know Dr Katz Now we go to the police No, not to the police To the Public Health Department An extremely tragic affair Excruciating pain Ten years of excruciating pain The attempt to alleviate it, and then suicide A deliverance, so to speak And his wife followed him in death, having for 10 years - What treatment did he receive? The medical profession hasn't much choice, unfortunately Morphine Now and then an alternative painkiller, usually an opiate, but mainly morphine But you'd have to speak to his doctor to find out more Just a minute Dr Katz I'm responsible solely for the supervision of drugs Isn't it possible he was addicted? A morphine addict? That's what I'm here for All prescriptions for opiates land on my desk Otherwise anyone could set up his own drug ring It's the responsibility of the state to protect people from themselves, ultimately You couldn't protect the Treibels from sleeping pills You're right Our scope is limited But how would you suggest we do that? If people hoard medicine for years to commit suicide - There's nothing wrong with the monitoring system It's people who aren't perfect, I'm afraid Or should I say fortunately? Have I answered your questions to your satisfaction? Not much of a story, journalistically speaking, is it? The Treibels left their doctor their entire estate, I hear: Their villa, their art collection, everything Really? I didn't know that - But I did - Of course You're a reporter That's not so unusual For many patients, their doctor is the one person they trust the most and to whom they owe the most Their death, for example? The person who stood by them until the hour of death, yes I think legacies of that kind are the finest expression of the relationship of trust between doctor and patient Don't you think so? Well You two work together? Occasionally I'm a photographer Do you want to put my picture in the paper? No, not really As you said, it's not much of a story, journalistically speaking Marianne? It's Achim You were right They were here - Would you really do it? - Sure. Tomorrow I'll try to get an appointment with her. Act the part of a wealthy lady Rich, lonely and unhappy with some undefinable pain Apart from the rich bit, it's all true Somehow it's not right to ask you to do it, since it involves your rival And you live all alone in this house? And you live all alone in this house? Since my divorce, yes I have household help, of course How do you spend your time, if I may ask? I have a small circle of friends, but they were mostly friends of my husband You know how it is I turn things over in my mind a lot That's not good No, it's not good No one forgot that Germany is becoming a new member of this community because Konrad Adenauer wishes it. It's not good to be so alone alone in your big house Yes, I've considered whether I shouldn't look for some occupation Financially I'm very well situated, but - An occupation cannot replace feelings NATO was founded, after all, when the West disarmed after the last war. But the East was not prepared to follow suit. The pains started after the separation from your husband? Yes, immediately afterwards I shouldn't really prescribe morphine, but someone to love you If the pains recur, come to see me at once At the first signs I certainly will, Dr Katz - Good-bye - Good-bye Robert, I have the prescription NoJust like that Yes Morphine! Can you imagine? No I have it in my purse I'll pick you up at your place We'll go to the police and tell them everything Afterwards we'll go to our place and tell each other everything Everything we know about each other I love you She killed her I beg your pardon? Why won't you believe me? Who else would have killed her? Just calm down It was an accident No one murdered your girlfriend Why would anyone want to kill her? Because she was a threat to her She had proof that she deals in morphine Morphine! Surprises you, doesn't it? Now I have proof Give me her purse There, in black and white Signed by her personally Morphine What do you say now? Radix valerianae. What's that? - A light sedative Valerian, in other words May I see? Yes I prescribed it this evening I know who the deceased is The man is suffering from shock Excuse me, please For the records It's been a great shock for you, Mr Krohn You need some rest She'll be the next one to be killed! When her money runs out, she'll be murdered! She's being kept prisoner here! Veronika please tell them Who are you, ma'am? My name is Veronika Voss Oh, you're Veronika Voss I'm pleased to meet you, ma'am Do you know this man? Not that well A reporter, I believe He wanted to interview me But he confused the situation with a personal conversation You understand what I mean? - Perfectly, ma'am I had to break off our talk What's the matter, Marianne? - Nothing I'll tell you later Something terrible has happened I'll tell you about it later I'm calling the police Come along, Mr Krohn Bye Thank you I thank you You did what had to be done Anyone in your position would have done the same His girlfriend had an accident She's dead Are you afraid? It must be strange to die Nonsense Life itself is strange What was that? No What should I be afraid of? I just feel a little dizzy She's slowly becoming a danger, along with this reporter Do you really think so? She has become unpredictable, hasn't she, Josefa? I've been saying that for months And she's still quite famous, in a way What do you suggest? We must get rid of her Once and for all What's your plan? She must have a grand exit, of course Publicity, glamour, a big party Then we'll go away for Easter and she'll be alone in the apartment Without any morphine, of course, but with plenty of pills I dreamt about our farewell party It was very nice - Yes It was very, very nice Farewells and arrivals are the nicest things in life You've given me a great deal of happiness I sold it to you I have always known where I stand with you Now I belong to you All I have left to give you is my death What was that? Nothing Just a line from an old movie From my old life You will be all on your own now Yes I'll sleep I'm interested in United Artists most of all No, with a U United Artists Artists united in their work Don't you think all artists should unite? You mean a kind of union? Good heavens, no For the freedom of art Art needs freedom How should it liberate people otherwise? I don't know And the other film company?
