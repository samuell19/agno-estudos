- Hey. What's up? What's wrong? Ray? Tell me. - Okay. I ... Zeke. Hello, is anybody home? - I think I'll go with Walter. - What? You don't like Zeke? Fine, then. - I didn't know it was a name. - It's a name. What is your perfect magical name then? - I don't know. Tom. - Wow! That Tom? - Very creative. - Yeah, so creative and innovative and never been done before. Yeah, great, Tom. - What? Agree to disagree? - And we've given birth to the 20 millionth Tom. - You see what it look like a pine cone. - I would not like a pine cone. - Smooshy. Hey. Hey. Thanks for doing this. Hey sleepyhead. Hi. What time is it? - Just after two. Have a nice nap? - Yeah. - Whoa. This light right now. You're looking very sexy. I'm having a real hard time keeping my eyes on the road. All right. - Hey, for real. You're doing really good. A lot better than the last ones. - Think so? - Know so. Plus it's gonna be fun. I'm excited! - Yeah, I'm excited. Are you excited? Are you sure? - I am very excited. Come on. - I'm excited! I'm more excited still. I don't think that's true. Well, I hope you like it. - Why wouldn't I like it? Come on, I'll love it. You grew up there, right? Yes, I did. Well, you turned out okay, so. I did. I love it, I love it, I love it. Ew, ew, no! How's it going? It's fine. Do you have the jack? Ray. I'm just, I'm sorry. I'm just saying, I've done it a couple times, so I don't know if you needed-- Can you just let me do it? I'm letting you do it. Can you stop hovering please? I'm not hovering. You're hovering. I'm literally over here! I'm not hovering. It's like you're over my shoulder. Just stop. Okay, then just do it. Would you like me to walk down the road? Would that make this easier for you? Can you just stop talking? This is the first time I've said anything in 10 minutes, okay? Can you stop? Just let me concentrate. Great. Wow. Great, someone's stopping. Oh, what are these guys doing? Can I help you? You guys need some help? No, we're uh-- Oh, you guys are lucky we stopped by. Not that many people come around here. - What brings ya all the way out here? Just goin' upstate for the weekend. Little getaway? - Yep. Exactly. - Well, you havin' trouble with the change? No, just, I got it. Flat tire can mean different things, so I'm tryin' to make sure I-- - Yeah. Many different types of flat tires. How long you two been together? - Anyway, thank you. We're all set, so, get back to the tire. - Have a tire iron. Look, we're good. I appreciate you stopping. - You got the tire off the car. Yeah, I know. Yeah, if you have one, that'd be great, thanks. - Vern. Reach for the car and fetch the shotgun. I'm just messing with ya. You see his face, Vern? Vern, will you go get the tire iron from the car and help this gentleman with the change? - Thank you. - No problem. While they do that, why don't we go look for the one you lost? - What? - The tire iron. I saw you throw it into the woods when we were drivin' up. Oh, that's all right. What's all right? Don't worry about it. But then you won't have a tire iron. Yeah, they're a dime a dozen. - I think they're a little more than a dime a dozen. It's a figure of speech. I know what a figure of speech is. - I wasn't saying you didn't. - You embarrassed? No. - Embarrassed to ask for help? - No, I just don't think that you guys need to... - It's all right. You help him with the tire, she'll come with me, we'll go find the tire iron. - I mean, if... Yeah, okay. Did you see where I... - Are you kidding? After you. - Thanks. - You know, I don't see it. I think we should probably go back. I don't think I would've thrown it this far. Really? - Yeah. Well, why don't we go a bit more in, then? A bit more in. - Look, I really think, I think we should really go back. I just, I don't think, please, I don't think it would be this far out. Just a bit more in. Told you. - Yeah. We should probably go back now. Yeah. So, you two lovebirds have fun back there? I was gettin' kinda jealous. Come on, huh? Okay, here we are. Wow. Yeah, check in is to your right. Not too shabby. This kitchen is amazing. They stocked us up. - Yeah. They're really excited that we're here this weekend. I'm excited that we're here this weekend. - Good. Look at all this wine. All right. - I have no idea what any of it is, so I make no promises about quality. - Quantity, not quality. Which one do you want? Doesn't matter, I'll pick. - I think this is much more your department. - We're gonna finish both of those by the end of the night, okay? - Okay. - All right, cool. Glad we agree. So, you could like, live here, huh? Right? It's like, a lot of space. - Don't you think you'd get bored? I don't know. I'm just sayin', no one else is usin' it. Let's at least try to have sex in every room of the house. - Absolutely. Why didn't I think of that? Right? Just take it from there. - Oh my God. What's that? - What? Oh, nothing. What is it? - It's nothing. Okay. - I would certainly wash those before I ate them if I were you. Tastes okay to me. Hey, Ray. Ray. Ray! Yeah. What's down this hallway? This little door, what is in there? What? What's down at the end of this hall? Oh, it's my dad's study. He didn't let us in there. Weird. So, like, you just never went in that room? What? - Your dad's study. You never go in, ever? No. - Have you ever been in there? No. He told us not to. - Yeah, when you were like, five, right? I, just... - What? Yeah, no, I've never been in there. - Your mom ever go in? I don't know. - So, he would just like, come home from work and disappear in this, like, weird little room that you're not allowed to go in? He wouldn't disapp-- he would just need to work and I don't understand. This is not like a weird thing. - It's kinda weird. Like, would you go in it this weekend? No. - You just won't open that door? I have no desire to go in. It really doesn't, like, it's not an issue. - I'm not saying it's an issue. I'm just saying, like, I had rules when I was a kid-- Okay, exactly. - And like, eventually I was allowed to like, go in my parents' room. I mean, I'm not gonna like, ask my dad for written permission to go into his study. I don't care. - I definitely wasn't asking to like, ask him for written permission. I was like, why do you need permission to go in? I just have no desire. - Like, we could just go open the door. Hey now. - Ooh, what's this? It's time. - It's time. He says forebodingly. - That doesn't taste very good. How much do you want? More? - Um, that's good. This much? - That's good, that's good. Oh my God. - I spilled some. - That's okay. - Don't tell your mom. - I won't. She never liked you anyway. So, you spilled it. - I hate this sweater. That's fine, that's fine. - Just lick, just lick it off. Okay. - Okay. - What are we... - I'm polishing it now. - What are we drinking to? - To this weekend. - To this weekend? - Yeah. - Sure. - It's not bad. - Let me just swirl it around my mouth a little bit. - Actually might be bad. I don't know what's good wine. It passes. It's a little robust for a merlot, but... - Oakey? Is it oakey? It's oakey. Ooh, that's-- Oh, fuck. ¶ There I need ¶ ¶ 'Cause I make you happy ¶ ¶ Just as happy as you can be, yeah ¶ ¶ Have you always ¶ ¶ There to love you ¶ ¶ And I'll be always ¶ ¶ There to love you ¶ ¶ And I never ¶ ¶ I never, never keep through ¶ ¶ 'Cause I'll be always ¶ ¶ Always there just for you ¶ ¶ I'm gonna hold ¶ ¶ I'm gonna hold you ¶ ¶ In my loving arms, yeah ¶ ¶ Oh baby ¶ ¶ Now, don't you want a man like me ¶ ¶ 'Cause I make you happy ¶ ¶ And this happy ¶ - Still smells the same. Like the trees outside. - Mmm, I think I'm burning some of those. - That's okay. It's warm. It's nice. Me and my dad and Augie would do this thing in the falls where we would go out to those trees and we'd get the um, like, like the pea pod things that would fall-- - Propellor things. - Yeah, the helicopter propellor things and we'd put them on our noses. - Why? - I have no idea. - Just to-- - Just to, because why not? And we'd come back inside and just like, try to have normal conversations with Mom as though she somehow wouldn't notice. - Did that work? - No, she always noticed. But she would see Augie. I think at this point, he was like, six or something and she would see the pea pods on his little six year old nose and she would just start hysterically laughing and he would always say because she laughed at him more than she laughed at me that he was obviously the favorite sibling. - This explains a lot. - Yeah. He was a really good kid. I don't know, I think, I think it kinda broke them, you know? - Yeah, I do. I can't imagine losing a kid what that does to a parent. I mean, it's, I'm sorry. - Yeah. Hey, Cory. Mmm hmm. Hey, Cory. Can we do that thing? Mmm, unh unh. - Please? No. - Please? - No. Please, please, please, please, please. - No way. - Please, come on. No, no, no, no. It is so helpful for the med school stuff, you can't even imagine. - That's true. It is true. - Didn't think about that. So you should, you should help me. Yeah. - Like, for real? Yeah. - Okay. I'm getting up. Okay. - Okay, thank you. Now, hold still. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Doctor's orders. Mmm. Sounds hot. Stay still. Mmm hmm. Okay, I am making the first incision into the pre-frontal cortex now. - Oh my God, just don't press that hard. Oh, you better know I love you. Do you? - Yes, no! What? Take it easy. Don't press that hard. What's wrong? Nothing. - Come on, what did I say? Ray, now stop. What? - You don't have to keep cutting. What? - I'm playing this game for you. Like, are you not having fun? Like, why am I doing this if you're not having fun? Why-- You're helping me, thank you. - I'm doing the fucking game you wanted me to do-- I know. Thank you so much for-- - I can never say anything right. You're just not actually saying anything. What did I say? What do you mean? You're the one being like totally-- Being like totally what? It sounds like you have something to say, so just say it. Just can you stop with the-- What am I asking-- - Fucking nut. Cory, Cory, Cory, wake up. There's someone knocking at the door. Shh! - I promise I'm not doing anything. Ow, ow, shit, ow! Jesus, Ray! Ow, oh. What time is it? I don't know, you just woke me up. - I know, well, there's someone at the door! Oh my God. What happened? That's a nasty cut. - Daddy did it. - Is there someone else that maybe you want us to call? Like, your mom? - Is this a game? - No. Can I get you something to drink, maybe? Like, some milk? Mmm hmm. - Okay, okay, hold on. - All right, hey, no. Let's not do that. Okay, there you go. Thanks, Mommy. - Okay. - Okay, we just wanted to ask you a couple questions. You know, so that we can figure out how to help you because I don't know that-- - Hey, where'd you come from, man? - Hey, hey. Come on, come on, that's not how we're gonna do this. - Let's get to it. - Okay, okay, Cory, okay. Sorry. What were you doing outside so late? I was hiding. - You were hiding? - From Daddy. He was trying to, Daddy hurt me, my mom, so I wanted to hide, but it was dark outside, so I... - What's up? - Whoa, hey, okay stop. I just wanted to come back inside. I'm sorry I ran away. - It's okay. You just shouldn't be outside so late. - I know, I'm sorry, Mommy. I just didn't want Daddy to hurt me anymore. - Why are you looking at me? Don't me mad, Daddy. - Can you not call me that, and could we call the cops, maybe? I think it's time. - Just relax, just relax. Okay. Okay. What's your name? - You don't remember? Dude! - Stop. - Zeke. I'm Zeke. - Okay, you got this from here. I'm going to bed. Goodnight. Is Daddy mad? - No. No. He's just, confused. And sometimes, when you get too confused, you can get scared. I didn't mean to scare Daddy. Hey, not at all, it's okay. It's okay, I know that you didn't, and he knows too, it's really okay. Why don't we just go to sleep and we'll figure out everything in the morning. We'll get you home. I am home, Mommy. - Okay, okay, come here, come here. Gimme things. Okay, goodnight. Mommy, the monsters turned out the lights. - Okay. Did you have a bad dream? - Yeah, monster tried eating me. - Okay well, you're safe now, I promise. See? No monster. He went away and ate someone else. Where would he hide? Mommy? - Gotcha! - Mommy, can I do your makeup? - Sure, okay. Can I ask you a question? Uh huh. Why did you let Daddy hurt me? I would never let anybody hurt you. - I know, but he still did. There, all done. - Okay, let's take a look here. This is really beautiful. - Now, I cut your hair. - Whoa! I still haven't paid you for the makeover. - It's on the house. - Thank you. I love it. - You're welcome. I'm comin'! I'm comin'! I'm coming for you. You better run! You better run! You got me! Is that as fast as you got? 'Cause I'm gonna get you! You better run! You better run, I'm coming for you! Zeke? Zeke, are you up here? Mommy. - You can't be in there. Come inside, Mommy. Cory! Cory! Zeke. I told you not to come in here. Where are you? Hiding. Hiding? No, come here, Zeke. Are we still playing, Mommy? You haven't got me. Zeke, you come here right now. No. Zeke, seriously, this is not fun anymore. I'm serious, Zeke, please. Cory, Cory, Cory! The door's locked, Cory! Oh, get me out, get me out, get me out, Cory, please! Please! Zeke. Please come here. I don't want to play any more. I don't like this game. Why don't you like it? Because Mommy doesn't like the dark, baby. Mommy's scared. Yes, Mommy is very scared. Zeke. I'm sorry, Mommy. It's okay. Isn't fun with just two people. We should get Daddy to play. No, no, that's not what I meant. It will be more fun. Well, Daddy's in bed and so we can't play with him, but if you help me get out of here, we can maybe find someone else to play. Someone like Augie? What? What did you say? Your brother. He says he misses you. Okay, this isn't fuckin' funny. You let me out right now. Don't you miss him? No, I'm so serious, if you don't stop-- Shh. He's here. Listen. Zeke, I-- Hi, Rayna. - Ray? Rayna? Rayna? Ray? Ray? Ray? Rayna? Ray! Ray. Ray. Ray! Where is she? Hey, hey, hey! Where is she? - How many of us did you check for Mommy? What? - Does Mommy know that you still have Amanda's phone number, that you talk to her? - Tell me where she is. - I will, but first, we have to do something. - Seriously? I made Mommy disappear. She won't be back until after we play. - Yeah, well I think maybe a kid your age shouldn't be playin' with the stove. Okay, Daddy. - Quit calling me that. - Sorry, Daddy. What is this, anyway? - It's milk tea. It's mine and Mommy's favorite. Oh yeah, I'm sure that lactose intolerant Mommy's favorite drink is milk tea. What's lactose intolerant? - Lactose intolerant is when you can't have milk or cheese. Why not? - Your body can't handle it. Well, what does your body do with it? - All right, so imagine Rayna has a piece of cheese and her stomach will, after, you know, it makes Rayna fart. Yeah, isn't that gross? - That's so weird. My milk tea never made Mommy fart when she was pregnant. - Yeah well, she's pretty good at hiding-- what? That's so weird. - No, what did you say? Milk tea never-- - No, after that, what did you say? What did you say? Just say the whole sentence again. Dude, what did you say? Shit. Hey, buddy. I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry. Just kind of a crazy night. I don't know what's going on and I really just need to find Rayna. So. If you could tell me where Rayna is, can you please tell me where Rayna is? She's upstairs in the deep room. Thank you. Ray? Cory. - Didn't you hear me calling? Are you okay? - I was... I didn't think... You scared me, you really scared me. Come here, I want to show you something. - Please come talk to me, Ray. We are talking. - I wanna talk in private. Please come talk to me. We are in private. - Please, Ray. What's wrong? - Please just come talk to me. Will you come outta there? ¶ Apple shampoo ¶ ¶ Oh yes I do ¶ ¶ Any apple shampoo ¶ ¶ Oh yes I do ¶ ¶ I love your morning coffee ¶ ¶ Or perfume ¶ ¶ I love your apple ¶ ¶ Apple shampoo ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ Or perfume ¶ ¶ I love your apple ¶ ¶ Apple shampoo ¶ Okay, please be careful. - I know. - Okay. - I know. Shh. It's okay. - Okay, okay, okay. - Okay. Rayna. I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now and I know that you might not share my feelings, but I'm asking you to just hear me out. I really think we, what are you doing? Stop. - Okay. - I think we need - Okay. - To call the cops. I would like to call the cops and get this boy out of your house. - Why are you so afraid of our boy? - What? - Why are you so afraid of this boy? - That's not what you said. - Hey, wait, stop, stop, sit down, sit down. Hey come on, it's okay, it's okay, shh. It's okay. - Oh, thing's will go back to normal. I just want things to go back to normal. - I know, it's okay. Hey come here. Come here, come here, come here, hey. Hey. I'm here, okay. Okay, come here, come here. We haven't had this in so long. I know, just, ow. Just be careful, stop. Ray, stop. Ray, stop it. What? What? - What is wrong with you? - You wanna know what's wrong with me? What's wrong with me is that you don't do or say anything. You just hide or retreat as soon as anything gets hard or gets complicated. I was not ready for this, either, but I was down to try to figure it out with you because that's what you do when you love someone. And after being asleep at the fucking wheel for five years, you decide to wake up and have a fucking opinion about anything and it's this and now you are the reason that I'm not pregnant any more. I'm so sorry. I don't even... - I'm sorry, too. I love you. I love you, too. - Oh my God, what? Are we okay? Yeah, we're good. You sure? Yeah. Pinky promise. Hi, I'm at 1332 Cooper Lake Road. Yeah, I just wanted to report that a kid showed up at my door in the middle of the night. I'm not sure who he is. Yeah, yeah, no, he's fine, he's fine, but I was just wondering if you maybe could send somebody to come pick him up? If that would be okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that'd be great. Okay, thank you so much, bye. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I don't think so. - You know, you should go to bed. I got him. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Ooh, ooh, careful. - That's fine. Love you. - Love you, too. - Love you more. - No. Come back to bed, Ray. Ray? - The pear's a monster egg. We have to find it before it hatches. If it hatches, it turns into a big monster! It eats the family! - Got it. - Ready? - Yeah. Go. I'm gonna get it, Mommy, I'm gonna get it. Get that monster egg. Nice try, Mommy. Get it, get it. Get it! Hey, no cheating! I'm not! I'm not cheating! What are you doing? Ah! Ray. I felt it! Found it? No you didn't. - I felt it. Oh, okay. Ray. Ah! Ray. - Gotcha. Mommy, that's scary! - No shit, it's scary. Ray, can you get him cleaned up? They're gonna pick him up any minute. - What? Put the scissors down. - No. - You really wanna do this right now? Ray, just put down the scissors. - No. Ray, give me the scissors. - Hey, ow! Hey, stop! - Put 'em down. Let go. Stop it. Get your hands off me! - Stop, stop fighting! - Fuck. - Hey, Daddy look! I got the egg monster. Hey, hey. - Ray just stop, Ray just stop, please stop. - For like, one second. It's okay, it's okay. Stop, stop, stop, stop. - Hey, you're okay, you're okay, it's okay. Can I show you? It's right over there. You can leave after if you want, I just, I just, I think you'll feel better. I think you'll feel better. If you let me show you, I think you'll feel better. - Stop it, stop. I think you'll feel better, it's right over there. - Stop, please stop, I'm leaving, I'm gone. Can I just show you? Oh, hold on, hold on. Okay. He's waking! Oh, here. Okay. It's gonna hurt again. We wanna make sure we don't hit him in the front. Do you remember why? Uh, because it'll give him a scar? No, because it'll give him brain damage, remember, and we don't want brain damage, right? Oh, right. All right, but if we hit him right here on the pressure point. Do you know why we're gonna do that? Because it will only knock him out? Exactly. All right, you ready? Yeah. - Your hair looks so nice pushed back like that. Why will you never wear it that way? It's okay, it's okay. - Are you gonna kill me? - I'm gonna ask you a question, and I'm only gonna ask it once. Will you come inside the deep room with us? - Untie me. Untie me. Untie me! - Okay. After a short procedure. Zeke, would you get those tools? Yes, Mommy. - Don't be afraid. Thank you. I'll walk you through it. I'll be performing a procedure called a transorbital lobotomy. I will carefully force an instrument through your eye socket to pierce the thin bone between your frontal lobes and your eyes. In the frontal lobe, I will then sever connection between the pre-frontal cortex and your thalamus, rendering you a bit more complacent. What's complacent? - More agreeable. - What the fuck are you talking about? - I don't want you to have to make this decision on your own, so I'm making it for you. - Help! Help! Help! Untie me, untie me, untie me, untie me untie me, untie me, untie me! Untie me you fucking cunt! I love you and I'm sorry. Hey, we can work this out. It doesn't have to, we can... Don't you love me? I'm sorry. I don't love you. I don't love you. I wasn't ready for a kid. I don't want a kid. I don't want your kid. I thought that might change. It didn't change. I'm sorry I forced you to do it, but I'm glad you didn't keep it. - Okay. Zeke, hold his head back. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no Ray! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no! ¶ Don't you want a man like me ¶ ¶ 'Cause I make you happy ¶ ¶ Just as happy as you can be ¶ - I don't think it worked, kid. I don't think it worked. Can you bring him inside like this? - We can, but it won't work like that. - Why not? - Because for the room to work, you have to want to go in. - So what happens if you bring him inside? Do you understand? - Okay. Okay, I need you to understand. I need you to say it after me, okay? I will never do that again. - I will never do that again. I promise. - I promise. I'm not mad, I just, you can never grab Mommy there again. We need to be on the same team, and to we each talk and we each have our boundaries and it's just important that you understand that, okay? - Okay. Okay, thank you, I, I appreciate that, I just-- - Can I go to my room? Yeah. Zeke, lunch is ready. ¶ Hello ¶ ¶ Is Laurie there ¶ ¶ I'd like to speak to her please ¶ ¶ For a minute ¶ ¶ And say ¶ ¶ I'm headin' home ¶ ¶ I'm fed up to here ¶ ¶ With the short side ¶ ¶ Of being alone ¶ ¶ Tossers stole ¶ ¶ All my money ¶ ¶ Denver ¶ ¶ Stomped on my pride oh yeah ¶ ¶ Going down for the third time ¶ ¶ Here in Salt Lake City ¶ ¶ So I'm callin' ¶ ¶ While there's time to turn the tide ¶ ¶ Hello ¶ ¶ Is Laurie there ¶ ¶ I gotta talk to her now ¶ ¶ Go and get her ¶ ¶ Hi babe ¶ ¶ It's me ¶ ¶ It's sure good to hear your voice ¶ ¶ I can't tell ya ¶ ¶ How much I missed ya ¶ ¶ Thought about ya ¶ ¶ And ¶ ¶ I've run out of schemes ¶ ¶ That'll win me blue ribbons ¶ ¶ And I've worn out my dreams ¶ ¶ On the life I've been livin' ¶ ¶ All I got left ¶ ¶ Is the love ¶ ¶ That I'm givin' to you ¶ ¶ I'm comin' home ¶
