[instrumental music] [water gurgling] [music continues] [gas hissing] (man on phone) 'If he's passed out, we'll send over the paramedics, okay?' No, you don't understand. There's no need for the paramedics. My husband is dead. 'Ah, we'll send them anyway.' [music continues] - Daddy never coming back? - No, I'm afraid not, sweetie. Not such a good way to start out your birthday, was it? No, what are we gonna do? Don't you cry, because we'll be just fine. - We will? - Of course, we will. Remember when I was a little girl. 'I didn't have a daddy, either.' And it was right around the time of my birthday too. And mama didn't think we were gonna make it. You was a little girl like me? That's right. Mama and I used to love to stay up late and watch TV. [upbeat music] (girl #1) 'Pom-pom! Pom-pom!' Pom-pom! Pom-pom! [female crying] Don't cry, mummy. It was just a movie. - I'm no good as a mama. - That's not true. You know what I should have done? I should have taken you and Dan-- - Don't-- - The day you were born-- Say that. - Have a mother like me. - That's not true. Oh, I love you, mama. Oh. I'll never find another man like Harlan Jewel. - Harlan was a champion. - Yeah. Baby. Baby. Baby. How do you like your mama to read to you? - Yeah, a little bedtime story. - Yes! Yes! Yes! Lend me the TV guide. - Okay-- - Wait. - Channel? - Nine. Okay. "Campus profile. View point on nutrition." Mmm. Now, here we are. Here we go. Wheel of fortune. You like to play wheel of fortune. If I was on that show. I'd get us a peach love sofa. Porcelain duck. And the best case of scotch, money can buy. Then all the kids at school would stop making fun of you. And I could get to have a pom-pom out there. So, they make fun of me at your school, do they? Except for Mrs. Crow. She says everybody should feel sorry for you. Well, I don't want their pity. So what if you don't dress in fanciest clothes in the world? I got you cable, didn't I? Yes. Well, I'd be working and making a lot of money. If I hadn't sprained my ankle getting off that bus, sick heals. Oh, it hurts mama to walk. Oh, Baby. Baby. Baby. Why don't you do me one of them pom-pom cheers on your way to bed? Okay. 42 and 12 and - 10! - That's right. - Uh. - Move your feet. 36 and 29 and Alright! [Timbuk 3 singing "A Sinful Life"] * Don't need nothing new * * Nothing too expensive * * Just a sinful life with you * * Give me something borrowed * * I'll buy you something good * * I'll trade this life for sorrow * * For a sinful life with you * * Sinful Life * * Sinful life with you * * No promises of paradise * * Just a sinful life with you * * Sinful Life * * Sinful life with you * * No promises of paradise * * Just a sinful life with you ** [cheering on TV] 'Push daises, babe. I'll stick it out then.' 'Okay, stay with General Ike.' '50 points to General Ike.' Awake, mama! Mama, awake! Mama, wake up! I'm late for school! What? What time is it? It's eleven and a half. Eleven and a half? Wake up! I'm late! [indistinct chatter] Baby, Baby. Get me a pencil and a pen. Oh, no, no, no! No, no, no! 'No, no, no!' Oh, no! Ah. Oh. Oh, no! Mrs. Crow's gonna be mad. Alright, don't worry. Don't worry, Baby. Dear, Mrs. Crow. [dramatic music] [music continues] Please forgive Baby for being so hideously late. Oh, Jesus! Entirely the fault of our next door neighbor. An elderly woman who kept us up all night, while she choked on a carrot. Respectfully. And with all my love. Claire Vin Blance. There, that ought to do it. Baby, your mama's done it again. Here, give this letter to that idiot teacher and say, "I'm sorry, Mrs. Crow. I overslept this morning." Sorry, Mrs. Crow. I over sleep out this morning. Here, here, like a pretty curtsy. I'm sorry, Mrs. Crow. I over sleep out this morning. Okay, that's good. Now, here. Give this dollar to R.J. at the liquor store and tell him to deliver you to school. Get some wieners for your lunch Oh, boy! Wieners! - Bye-bye, see you later. - Bye, honey. Bye. Ah-h! Who it! Who that man? Well, he must be the new janitor, Baby. I'm sorry. I was just about to knock. What is he doing here? I don't know. Is he gonna be our new daddy? Goodbye, Baby. Joe Magneson, maintenance. 3F says you got some water dripping down that's staining the ceiling. Oh, well, maybe you better come in and take a look. Probably your sink. My sink? Looks like that's where your problem is. Not surprising either, not the way you're around in this dump. Bagdasarian's no better than a slumlord, Joe. Yeah, like them, cheap toilet paper. he bought for the building. Went with the duty points of the mighty probe. Jerk! He thinks he's better than everyone. And guess who has to replace every single one of 'em? Except for yours. 'Cause you got what, one of those fancy electric ones? That's right. - And 1B. - Teresa. I can't get in there. Every time I go to the door there's one of them Barbra Streis-Burg records playing and someone's crying like a wounded goat. Listening to Streisand can be very moving for a girl. Must get awful lonely down there in the boiler room. Ain't so bad. Got me a fan. Some magazines. I think your problem's fixed. Can't go wrong with a little duct tape. Care for a cocktail before you go, Joe? Cocktail? Yes. Sure, I can go for a little something. [upbeat music] Bye! (Mrs. Crow) 'Who does she think I am? The village idiot?' 'I'm sorry, Mrs. Crow. I over sleep out this morning.' I'm sorry, Mrs. Crow. I over slept out this morning. - I'm so sorry-- - Baby. That's enough. Now. Let's see what we have for lunch. Then, you can go out and play. It's pimento loaf. Just the way you like it. Plenty of real butter and mayonnaise. Mmm. 'I almost forgot.' I got this last night. I saved it for Carl. Carl got him his own house to live? 'That's right.' You know, Baby. I'd like to come and see where you live. I'm sorry, Mrs. Crow. My mama don't allow no teachers in our house. Is that right? Yes. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Votre santé. What? Votre santé. That's French for bottoms up. Oh, oh, oh! [laughing] Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Sometimes, I just speak French without even realizing it. Ha-ha, oh! You see, I'm just nuts about anything French. That's why I chose Vin Blance as my theatrical name. You see, I used to be a dancer, Joe. You mean like twirling around? That kinda stuff? 'That's right.' I used to dance on television. The Sonny and Cher Show. Well, that little guy with the moustache. That's right. That was Sonny. One of the most talented performers I ever knew. Cher practically threw him in my arms. When I was in the army once. Tell me it wasn't Vietnam. That godless, sexless wall. Worse. Fort Brad. This candy-ass lieutenant has got it out for me all the time. I despise lieutenants. So I says to the fucking MP's "So someone steals a fucking TV set. "I know nothing about no fucking TV set, sir. "Maybe the fucking lieutenant, fucking planted the fucking TV in my fucking room, sir." Guess who ends up spending 60 days in the fucking stockade? Your country betrayed you. Oh! That just gets my blood to boiling. I've a good mind to write the commander-in-chief and believe you me, I can find out who that is, too. I wish there was something I could do as an American citizen. [instrumental music] Something to help you forget your pain. What do have in mind? Seeing my autographed picture of Sunny Bono would brighten your day. I keep it hanging above my bed. Yeah. It says "Claire, I got you, babe." Let there be light! [upbeat music] Wow! So like a cat house in Lynchburg. Meow. Meow? Grr! Oh! I get it. You come over here. You sit right by me. You big old angel baby. [music continues] So, uh.. Should I, you know. Take off my clothes, that kinda thing? Yeah, let's be savages. [music continues] * I wanna snuggle * * I want you now and * * That's the love * * Let's make love * * If it's Candy you want * * I'll give you my lips * * If it's ice-cream that you need * Oh. Ah-h! - Hmm. - Ugh! * Listen up now, baby * * I'm tired out now * * Might make me do, do, do, do * Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof! - Ruff! - Ruff! Grr.. Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow! [rhythmic thudding] [speaking in Spanish] (Joe) 'Grr.' 'Woof! Woof! Woof!' [thudding] [snarling] [snarling continues] [thudding] [speaking in Spanish] Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof! [speaking in Spanish] [screaming] Nice mattress. [gulp] Hello, Mr. Beamer. Have a nice day. Mama, I home from school. Time to get up. Mama? Mrs. Crow wanna get an appointment with you. [doorbell rings] Mama, there's someone at the door. Who is it? 'Squeaky frog. Charlie sent me.' It's Teresa! - Hi, honey. - Hi. Mwah. Mwah. - Say hi to Carl. - Hi, Carl. That's alright. Where's your mother, hon? What you got? You got your face on a picture! Yes, honey. I had my portrait taken in Montgomery Wards. I'm giving my bonus print to your mother. Wow! Mama, look. Teresa brought us a present. Hello, Teresa. Oh, Teresa. It's lovely. The photographer said I look just like a young Pam Dawber. What do you think? Mama? Mama? - Thank you, Teresa. - You're welcome, Teresa. Mama, can I put some of your candies in my cake. Sure, honey. Do whatever you want. Thank you. Well, you look like you've been worked by the national guard. - Does it show? - Only if I keep my eyes open. Baby, what are you doing? I'm making a rum cake surprise for my teacher. Well, don't make a mess. So, tell-tell. Anyone I know? Come on, what are you waiting for? Oh, sorry. Hello, Ms. Tremaine. Hello, there. - Sexy boy. - Teresa. Yeah, well. Listen, I still got some time left. Yes. Well, we'll discuss my drains later. I hope you are available tomorrow morning. I'd like you to snake my tub. Yeah. Well, uh. Alright. You know.. I just close my eyes and pretend he's bigfoot. Sounds like my new boyfriend. Rafael. Rafael? R-R-Rafael. Midnight, dawn, the express line. Just the low hum of the freezer lockers and the boys slapping cellophane on a day old hamburger. He was a dollar short. And had a dragon tattooed on the biggest bicep I had ever seen. Mmm. So, I said. Honey, marry me and I'll pay for those Vienna sausages. Oh, oh, oh. [indistinct chatter] Two spoon yellow candy. And then I said. Slap me, so I know I'm not dreaming. And Claire, he almost did. Ah-h, Teresa! He sounds too good to be true. Half a cup pink candy. (Claire) 'Oh, Teresa. I wanna hear more.' - 'Why don't you stay?' - Oh, honey. I'd love to. But I promised Rafael that we'd dine at the Sizzler. [speaking in Spanish] [speaking in Spanish] Speak of El Diablo. [speaking in Spanish] Okay, okay. I'm coming. Claire. I tell you, if immigration doesn't catch him. I'm going to live happily ever after. Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Teresa! So, did you give the pretty note to your teacher? Yes, I said "I'm sorry, Mrs. Crow. I over sleep out this morning." What did she say? She said, she's gonna call you here at 6 o'clock sharp. 'And she said, you better take her call.' 'Or she'll file a report.' A report? Yeah, she's gonna file a report to social studies. So, then what happened? So then, lunch time was over. And Mrs. Crow let me feed the fish. And then, Mrs. Crow said she's gonna make everyone sing happy birthday to me, even Pam. You got a birthday coming up, Baby? Yeah, November the tenth. 'Are you sure?' You are really growing up, Baby. I remember when I used to pick a day and say, it's your birthday today. And I'd let you pick out any TV show you wanted. [telephone ringing] And you'd always pick my favorite. [telephone ringing] So, what TV show you gonna watch this year? HBO's playing Planet of the Apes. Mama, the phone is ringing. Yeah, mama. It's really ringing. It's Mrs. Crow calling for you. What? You answer it. But mama, it's my teacher. No, you answer it. And you tell her, I'm not here. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Crow. Hello, Baby. Is your mother at home? No, my mama's not home. Tell her, I'm rolling bandages for the Red Cross. What? The Red Cross. She's rolling around with the Red Cross. Really? Baby? Could I come and pay you a visit tomorrow? Uh-uh, my mama always says if she ever finds a teacher in our house she's gonna spank them until they screaming for an ambulance. [laughing] Would Carl allow teachers to come visit him? I don't know. You want to ask him? Hello? Yes, Mrs. Crow, this is Carl. Yes, you can come over to my house. You can come over to my house tomorrow. Baby! Bye. Uh-oh! [upbeat music] Mama? Mama? Mama? Mama? Can I go up on the roof and feed my birds? Sure, Baby. Sure. But first, could you get your mama a cocktail? Okay. Got you! You little flying shit machine. Ah-ha! Get outta here. Sons of bitches. Got you! Janitor Joe, what are you doing? What are you doing up here? I'm feeding my birds. - You're feeding them? - Yes. What do you got in the bag? - Bag? - Yeah. I, uh, found some of your birds. It must have got washed or something, uh? 'There, you see.' You saved my birds. 'Aww!' Yeah. Well. His name is Wendy. 'You can hold him.' Okay. Thanks. You're welcome. You ain't so stupid, after all, huh? Free food. A roof to shit on. [dramatic music] Mama! That's for your arm smell. Honey, here. Take this note and put it down the trash chute. Okay, good. Here. [instrumental music] "Dearest, darling, Joe. "Unfortunately "I must cancel "our love-feast this morning. '"Because Baby has gotten herself into' '"terrible trouble with her teacher' "at school. "I shall try to be strong. "In the jaws of hell. '"Your love slave.' '"Claire Vin Blance.' "P.S. "Joe plus Claire equals wow." - What time is she coming? - 10 o'clock. 10 o'clock? Why in the God damn hell do you have get up so God damn early? [knock on door] Wait, wait, wait. [door bell rings] - Okay? - Wait, wait, wait. [knock on door] Jesus. Wait, wait. [doorbell ringing] Okay. Mama, it's Janitor Joe. Joe. Joe. I'm expecting company. If you think, I'm gonna sit around and let some teacher mess around with you and the little princess. Well, then you don't know Joe Magneson. Joe. There's nothing you can do. Oh, yeah? Well, I happen to be 100% man, peaches. It's rum cake surprise. Joe, get out. [dramatic music] [music continues] You cannot help me. Oh, yeah? Well, that's what you think. I was in high school, this one time. And this teacher is riding my ass the whole time. So, one day. He's accusing me of burning up the school bulletin board. You know? So I flip him off. And he clamps me up against my locker. And so, I says to him, I says "Hey, you fuck faced geek. Leave me the fuck alone or I'll call the fucking cops." Joe, look. - I appreciate you trying-- - This is good! I made it myself with mama's special candy. Joe.. [Joe grunting] Mama's special candies? Wha-what, from the medicine chest? Oh, Jesus. How much did you put in, Baby? Three tablespoons yellow candy, half cup pink candy. A half a cup of 20 milligram valium. Jesus, God! Joe! Wake up! [knock on door] It's Mrs. Crow from Thurgood Marshall Elementary. Oh, Jesus. [knocking continues] Baby, Baby, Baby. One moment please. [knocking continues] - Okay. One moment, please. - Another moment, please. It's Mrs. Crow. Baby, Baby. Get me some pillows. [doorbell ringing] - One moment, please. - Another moment, more moments. Okay. - Is that good? - That's good. - One moment, please. - Come on. I'm coming. Baby, Baby. Open the windows. It looks like a mausoleum in here. [doorbell ringing] Now, Mrs. Crow can see the dead pigeon which smacked itself into the window. (Claire) 'Baby, get the door.' [knocking continues] [doorbell ringing] Okay. Good morning, Baby. My teacher's in my house. My teacher's in my house. Mrs. Crow, come. See the pigeon. He's dead. Baby! I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Crow. I'm, Claire Vin Blance, Baby's mother. I was just finishing my morning reading session. Well, won't you sit down? (both screaming) No! No, let's sit over here. I'm afraid that couch has seen better days. There. Well...I'm going to make us all a nice hot breakfast which I do every morning. And you just ramble on about whatever it is you want. I'm not hungry, and I'd like to get straight to the point. Certainly. Baby is not living up to her potential. Uh-oh. Although she's a warm and sharing child who excels at rhythm band. 'That's enough.' I am extremely concerned about her poor performance in reading, writing. Not to mention, arithmetic. 'Education is her only way out of this gutter.' There are very few jobs that require excellence in rhythm band. Uh, have you ever heard of "The Solid Gold Dancers"? I think they make a little more money than teachers. [locks clicking] Baby's birth certificate lists the last name as "Bump". "Baby Bump"? That's right. Vin Blance is my theatrical name. Yeah, and at Halloween time, she's big hobo, and little hobo. 'Uh..' ...do you and your husband have any pet names for each other? My husband's been dead for ten years. I'm sorry. Suicide? Ms. Bump, may I speak to you alone? Certainly. Baby. Now, I want you to go to your room and memorize 12 times everything up to six hundred. - Okay. - I'll quiz you later. Ms. Bump.. ...you don't fool me for a second. And now that I've seen the disreputable living conditions. Look at this couch. I have no other choice than to report you to social services. What? Because of a couch? With my recommendation, social services will have the child removed to a foster home immediately. Removed? What? Mrs. Crow, I fully intend to do a complete spring cleaning and I'll get a new couch. My, what a pretty outfit. And when do you plan on having this spring cleaning completed? December. By Saturday. And it better be good. Because if I get her out of here.. ...I'll see to it, she never comes back. What are you talking about? If I can find Baby's natural father I could place her with him permanently. What makes you think Baby has a natural father? Go on.. In between theatrical engagements.. ...I was a receptionist at a sperm bank called "Hope on Ice". I was working there when the San Fernando Earthquake hit. 14 donors died on the job that day including our champion wackman, Harlem Jewel. 'I was luckier.' I was trapped in the freezer where the specimens where kept. Broken vials everywhere. For three days, I was hip deep in a river of white. Shall I draw you a picture? No. So you see Baby could literally have hundreds of fathers. I think you'll notice on this certificate under father it says, "List available on request". And that's exactly what I did. (Claire) 'So you-you-you--' (Crow) 'Yes, I did. And let me tell you, Ms. Bump.' 'I'll do anything to get that poor little girl' 'out of this pig pen.' (Claire) 'I'd be careful about throwing around the word "pig".' 'That does it!' 'I'll make it a personal goal to take that child away from you.' (Claire) 'What do you know about raising a child?' Do you know what it is to take care of a child? Mama. I think.. Baby.. Baby, please. Please. I love, Baby. You can't take her away from me. Ms. Bump, loving a child and raising a child are two different things. (Mrs. Crow) 'She needs a father. Someone with a job.' Goodbye, Baby. I'll seen you on Monday. And Ms. Bump.. ...make sure she gets to school on time! Yes...yes...I will. I'll make sure she gets to school on time. Even if I have to get up myself. Well, you really helped, didn't you? Joe Magneson, man of the hour! You've really gone and done it, Janitor Joe. Mama's gonna spank you with a pancake turner 'then you gonna be sorry.' No TV for you tonight. Are you gonna go live with the fosters at their home? Baby...no. No. If Harlem Jewel were here, he would know what to do. [doorbell ringing] Who is it? (Teresa) Someone who's gonna rape and kill you! It's Teresa. Honey. If that woman I saw blowing out the front door is Baby's teacher we're gonna have to send her to school with a cross in her hand and a garlic necklace. So, how'd it go? It was a complete disaster. Joe ruined everything. He's gonna get a spanking he's never gonna forget. He passed out on the couch, we had to cover him with a blanket. And Mrs. Crow, almost sat her big butt on his head. - Dear.. - Teresa. She's trying to take my little angel away from me. She said I have to have a new couch. I have to have this place clean like a hospital. I guess, I'll just have to kill myself. - 'No, mama, no.' - Now, Baby, honey. Your mother and I need to talk. No, mama, no, ma. Why don't you go to your room for a little while and color. Baby, be careful. Now, Claire, calm down. We'll just clean this place up. Okay? No, she's not gonna stop there. She say's I have to have a husband. One with a job. Well.. ...he's had a steady job for almost three weeks now. Joe? Look, honey, you're the natural mother. There's no way in hell she can take Baby away from you if you're married. I'd say, the only thing you have to worry about 'is getting a new couch.' Teresa.. ...I have had my eye on a beautiful peach love sofa in the Sears catalogue. It looks just like something Marie Antoinette would've owned. And how you're gonna get this showpiece? [snapping fingers] I got this old Sears credit card. Yes, there it is. They tried to take it away from me. But I wouldn't let 'em have it. Honey. You use this, you'll end up in county jail. [phone ringing] Vin Blance residence. Oh, it's Nathan Flowers and I'm calling you from the laundry room. Oh, it's you. It's Nathan Flowers. I'm sorry to disturb you-- I thought I told you to lose my number. Look, is Ms. Tremaine up there? She's been hogging the dryers. It's over two hours now, and it's just not fair. No, it's not fair. I'd be happy to kill myself. - What did she say? - You heard her. I am gonna have to report you to the landlord. Yeah, why don't you report us to the landlord. We're running scared up here. I despise that weasel. You don't have to live next door to him. Every time I put on a Barbra Streisand album he starts banging on the wall. So, I just put on "Don't Rain On My Parade" and I sing as loud as I can. Good. I cringe when I see him come home from work. Looking like, like a mortician, that awful blue suit. With his little, his little Sears...namepad. Sears? Teresa. - Teresa. - Claire. No, Teresa, woah, woah, woah, Teresa. Claire. Claire, what are you going to do now? Teresa.. ...on your way home tonight would you mind just slippin' a little note under Mr. Flower's door? [instrumental music] Bye-bye. Thank, thank you! Mama? Wake up, I home from school! And what did you do in school today? I didn't go to no school today. But why didn't you go to no school? Because R.J. don't got enough gas. And then we were going to the price bar and they was playing pool. Baby, what are you doing home so late? R.J. says what does he look like? The Unified School District Licenser? And he's not going to do it no more unless you give him more money. Well, I don't have time for R.J.'s crap today. Mr. Flowers is gonna be here any minute. [doorbell ringing] - That's him. - That's him? Baby, get the door. - Are you Mr. Flowers? - Yes. I'd seen you before in the lobby. - Is your mother at home? - Yes. You can, you can sit here with me on the couch. [jar tinkling] These are my rocks. You can hold them. - Oh...rocks. - Yes. These are my bugs. You can hold them. - Bugs? - 'Yes'. Would you like me to read to you from my book? Shouldn't we outta wait until your mama comes out-- Peter Piper packed a pack of pickled peppers. A pack of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked. 'Peter Piper packed a pack of pickled peppers.' Nathan Flowers. Mama! I'm reading to Mr. Flowers from my book. Well, it was just so charming of you to accept my invitation. Can I get you a cocktail before dinner? Oh, no, thank you. [Baby screaming] I don't drink. But you go ahead. I don't mind. Oh, well, no. I only keep it on hand in case of company. Praise the Lord. It's only poison. Yes, well. Oh, wait a minute, Baby.. Baby, why don't you go over to Mrs. Alvarez's and borrow some instant coffee and some High-C. Alright. Nathan. Nathan. I've been dying to get to know you better for such a long time. That's why I hoped you did accept my little invitation. Well, we have had our differences in the past, I know. Let's let bygones be bygones. Oh, thank you. Uh...somethin' sure smells awful good around here. Oh, I'd hoped you'd like it. It's called Campbell's Stew. Well, if it tastes just half as good as it smells. Oh, it's a very simple recipe, um.. ..you take a package of wieners then cut the wieners into one inch slices. Set the wieners aside. Next, open a can of pork and beans. I prefer Campbell's. A can of corn. Drain, then combine the ingredients. Then let them simmer for five or ten minutes. And viola! Campbell's stew. My goodness. Who says you have to spend a lot of money at the house of pies, to get a good meal. And you know what the best thing about it is? It's even better the next day. You know what, if you want I could just wrap up the leftovers and you could take it with you to work. Wherever that might be. - Sears - Sears? Sears and Roebuck? Oh, my goodness! That store has everything. Why, that is our slogan. [laughing] Yeah, I am the supervisor in the credit department. [both laughing] Aren't you somethin', you sly dog, you. Why, Nathan, that kind of job calls for a very intellectual kinda man. [door opening] Mrs. Alvarez says, "What does she look like? The Welfare League?" And when are you gonna pay her back for all the booze you're always loaning off of her. Baby. Baby. Go set the table. Mrs. Alvarez drinks. Mama! Mama! That stove is burning up. Oh, Jesus! Oh, well. Oh, that's good. I'll be careful not to scrape from the bottom. Okay, everybody, dinner's served. There. Okay. - Let's eat. - Claire. Would you do the honor of saying grace. Grace? Please. Sure, why not? Baby. Our father, the Virgin Mary and all you holy blessed saints give us, the Lord, which we are about to eat and we thank him for this food. Ave, ave Maria. Amen. And may I offer a prayer up to you, O Lord. For our dear sister, Claire. Who has worked so very hard on this meal which we are about to offer up to you. We are all your unworthy servants, but we try. Dear...sweet...blessed Jesus. That we may walk in your holy light. And that we might be amongst those chosen to ride up to your loving bosom. In your blazing chariot, on the day that you rose like you did in the temple. With your mighty sword of justice to slay the wicked. Amen! Yes, Jesus, yes! Slay everybody in Hollywood. Especially the manager of the 7/11 on Ivar. Amen to that. Let's eat! [doorbell ringing] - Someone's at the door. - Excuse me, Nathan. It's Janitor Joe. Well, I don't believe I put in a call for maintenance. Well, I just thought that we could get together. Oh, what on earth for? Are you a handyman..? What, what is he doin' here? See here, Magneson. I hardly think the lady's affairs are any of your business. And I, I'm sure our landlord Harry Bagdaserian, wouldn't think so, either. Oh, yeah...you little termite. Oh, of all the impudence. I will have you fired for this. Help! Help! Don't hurt him. (Joe) 'What do you care?' [knocking on cupboard door] So, now it's the handyman, huh? Magneson! [knocking continues] - Joe, I can explain this. - Handyman? Let me out of here What happened to that angel baby? What happened to "I'll be Peaches, you be Herb"? Claire! Joe...Mr. Flowers is gonna help me get a new couch. So, naturally I have to-- So naturally, you're gonna show him that picture you got hanging over your bed. Help! You're a liar, Claire. You lied to me, and you used me. You can just keep those goddamn boxers shorts if you think they smell so good! [knocking continues] (Nathan) 'Help!' Oh, Nathan. Oh, Nathan, I'm-I'm so sorry. Well, come and sit down. That Philistine.. That Goliath! Dear Lord, loose a plague of locusts upon him. Send in an angel of death. Well...I'll write a little note to the landlord. - Harry Bagdaserian? - Yes. The angel of death? I'll have that impudent scoundrel fired. No, no.. Nathan, you can't, he'd lose his job. Janitor Joe loves mama. - Oh, no! - Oh, yes. Oh, no.. Dear, sister Claire. Oh, this is much, much worse than I thought. Dear God...give me the strength. Until that Philistine is purged from this building I will not leave this woman's side. That won't be necessary. Oh, not at night, of course. And I do have to go to work. But aside from that, I will be the guard at your gate. A soldier. A soldier of God. Nothing can sway my resolve. Amen to that. "Dearest, darling, Joe." "Can I dare hope that you will forgive me "after I have hurt you so, my poor wounded dove. '"Can I dare hope that one day soon '"we will be married?' "Please say yes, and then read on. Yes...I will marry you. "Now, we must endure a terrible separation. "of a week or so. "Oh, my beloved for I must get a couch. "Be strong, my brave Indian. "For a week shall seem like four or five days. "Sincerely. And with every dripping ounce of my love Claire Vin Blance." [sobbing] Claire. And taking him aside from the crowd Jesus put his fingers inside the man's ears. And spitting, he touched his tongue. Then, he looked up to heaven.. ...sighed, and cried Ephphatha. That is..."Be thou open". What a pretty prayer. Who wrote that one? Well, that was the apostle Mark. Mark, Chapter seven, verse 31. I just adore Mark. Um...what was that, that Jesus said? Ephphatha? Be thou open. Yes, that's it. You know, I just find it fascinating when people are open with each other especially about God and all that junk, don't you think so? It is so important. Do you think that God would strike me dead if I prayed for something for Baby? Well, I can't see why. I'm so glad you said that. You see, Baby's been asking for a peach love sofa for her birthday and.. (Claire) '...I'm a little short of cash.' Peach love sofa. That child told me if she could only she have a peach colored love sofa, she'd devote the rest of her life to God. A peach love sofa. Oh, darn it, Claire. The Lord...he sure works in mysterious ways. Because Sears has one of them in the catalogue. Praise Jesus! You're kidding. No. Oh, dear Lord please make a peach colored love sofa jump right out of this catalogue and into my living room by Saturday. Hala-hala-hala. I'm a countin' on you, Lord. I'm a countin' on America. Claire, I would like to make that miracle happen for you. Oh, Nathan, you're not God. You're only the supervisor of the credit department of.. That's right, Claire. Sears! Nathan, I would be honored to accept a credit card from you. And I would be honored to accept a credit application from you. But Claire.. You need to score 100 points. And as a single, non working mother I don't see how you can score much more than ten.. What I'm trying to say, Claire, is.. ...the wife of a credit supervisor could score 100 points. Maybe more. - The wife? - I know it's awful sudden. But ever since I first met you.. Darn it, Claire, I think I'm in love with you. Will you marry me? Well, woah, the marriage, that's a big step. There's gotta be an easier way to make a miracle happen here. How about if we just kinda swap miracles. - I burn for you, Claire. - Uh-uh-uh! I will buy you that sofa as an engagement present. - By Saturday? - I swear on the Bible. Alright, Nathan, we're engaged. But you can't tell anybody. Joe will foam at the mouth. Oh, I promise. But you don't have to worry about that libertine Bagdaserian promised me that he would him his papers. What? Claire...Claire, I think I'm gonna cry. You've made me so happy. - You made me happy too. - No, I don't deserve this. Yes, you do. Oh, you've made me so happy. I'm happy too. I'm really, truly happy. I'm happier than I've ever been in my entire life. [drilling] Baby, stay in the room. [drilling continues] Joe, what the hell are you doing? I love you! So you drink a gallon of scotch and bore holes through my door. Lord, they ought to write a song about this. That's right. * I'm drilling a hole through your door * * I'm drilling a hole through your door * * You never let me in.. ** Joe...I thought I told you not to step foot in my apartment for a week. Well..I just couldn't keep away. I mean, I've never met anybody like you before. You got class. You got class up the butt! I got you a little present. (Claire) 'What?' "Musical door chimes. "Every time someone comes through your door love will fill your home." Twelve bucks. [door chimes chiming] That's very sweet, Joe. Nothing, but the best.. ...for my wife. Uh, Joe, woah, woah, Joe, Joe. Joe, there's something I gotta tell you here. Come...come here. I don't know how I'm gonna explain this. I was gonna tell you in a little note. Peaches, I read every goddamn note you ever wrote. [laughing] Yeah, well, good. I'm glad to see you in such a good mood. I always said, you're the kinda guy who can roll with the punches. It's over. Over? What do you mean it's over? I'm engaged to Nathan Flowers. Nathan? No. No-no, you-you're engaged to me. I love you. Well, sometimes love ain't enough. So, that's it? You're just gonna throw me out like some mangy dog? No, Joe, I'm sorry. Oh, you're sorry? No-no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm gonna splatter my brains all over your apartment. [drill whirring] Joe, for Heaven sakes! [crying] You think I'm just a punk. Some little cockroach you can squash with your high fuckin' heels. Joe, you are not a cockroach, alright? Or maybe I am. But did you ever just squash part of a cockroach, Claire? The other half can go on living. The other half could go crawling across your hand when you're not looking. Its guts all hanging out of its back. That's just what I'm gonna be, Claire. I'm gonna be the other half of a cockroach who'd come crawling across your face when you least expect it 'cause this cockroach hates your fucking guts. Ugh! Ugh-ugh-ugh! [melancholic music] Magnuson. Get your stuff and get out. - What? - I said get out. You're fired. [laughing] - Fired? - You heard me. Yeah, janitor, get out. Get your stuff and get out. Ok, look, Mr. Bagdasarisa I know what you're thinking. Look. I'll give you back the light bulbs, okay. Keep the damn light bulbs, alright. I got enough trouble without you screwing around that broad in 4-F. Oh, and there is your check minus rest of the day. (Baby) 'Mama, how come you're reading phone numbers' 'from my friends at school.' (Claire) 'No reason.' You're talking to Pam Stain's mama? That's right. Pam Stain told me she's going to get a slumber party and Rainbow Smiles is coming over and she's not inviting me. Well, that little bitch! Who is Rainbow Smiles? He is the clown on TV that rides the pony. And I told Pam Stain that Rainbow Smiles is not coming to her party 'cause Rainbow Smiles only likes little girls that's nice. Baby, how would you like to pick out a present for your birthday? - Planet Of The Apes. - No. A real present. Some fish. Fish are nothing more than our bowels floatin' around in dirty water. Pick somethin' else. Some lipstick. Shoot for the stars, Baby. Alright, an elephant. Well, that ain't gonna happen. Here. You get to pick anything you want from this catalog. Ah, look. From this page. - This one. - No, not that one. - This one? - A love sofa? - Yes. - Good. Now, look, you even get to pick the color. - Baby, did you notice a peach? - Peach! - Peach. - Peach. - Peach. - Peach. Oh, baby, you should've been an interior decorator. Well, honey, if you want a peach colored love sofa.. Yes! - For you.. - Yes. If you want a peach colored love sofa that's what you're gonna get. And-and-and pom-pom? Oh, now, don't be greedy, Baby. That's unbecoming. Fuckin' crazy bitch. Got me fired. I don't need this fuckin' job. Hope On Ice Sperm Bank. "According to our records you could be the possible father." Baby bump! I could be the princess' old man? Hey, Claire! This bug ain't dead yet. I got you, babe. [evil laugh] "And after he said these things he spat upon the ground "and made clay with the spiddle. '"And he spread it over his ass and said' '"Go, wash thee in the Pool of Siloam."' He spat on him and then he's takin' a bath? Nathan, can't you find one chapter where he's not spittin' or sticking his fingers in somebody's ears? I-I'm sorry. Well, we don't want Baby pickin' up bad habits. [doorbell rings] - Who is it? - 'Might be a hit-woman.' Oh, boy! It's Teresa. Mama, look. It's Teresa. Hello, Ms. Tremaine. No one shouting hallelujah right now, so, relax. Honey, I got us a clown for the party. - What? - Hallelujah! Praise Jesus. Praise me. The girlfriend of mine does clowns. What? What? Honey, you got this place lookin' pretty good. Mama's been working like a slave. Oh! That she does every day of her life, sugar. Now, I got to run and pick up Rafael from traffic school. He ran his Gran Torino straight through an AM/PM Mini Mart. - Sweet Jesus! - That's what Rafael said.. ...when I grabbed his crotch and he hit the gas. Goodbye, girls. - 'Buh-bye, Teresa.' - 'Bye, Teresa.' Now, uh, how about a little something from Luke? I love Luke. Uh, yeah well, at that time.. "there was a certain poor man named Lazarus who lay "at a rich man's gate. "He was covered in sores And they had puss coming out of them and they were scabbies. - What? - No. Um, well, um, let me see. - Lepers, no. - Oh, I love lepers. No, Nathan. "Of course, my main concern is for the child's welfare." Well, yeah. Me too. You aren't exactly what I had in mind, Mr. Magnuson but unfortunately I had only one response to my letter. Well, most guys who whack off professionally take their 25 bucks and figure, "That's it." I've spoken to Principal Tiptin about your job situation. 'You'll be starting on Monday helping out' 'with the custodial duties.' No. I'm not gettin' up at six o' clock in the morning to hang around with a hundred kids screamin' like a bunch of dying cats. I'll see to it that you're on the after-school shift. Yeah, well, you do that. And maybe princess can do some of the work. Yes. Well, there's just one problem. What? Haircut? No, Mr. Magnuson. You're not married. [indistinct] you gonna give onyour birthday today. [squeaky] I'm gonna sit here in my baby bed 'and not get messed up' and I'm not gonna expect nothing special. [doorbell rings] Who is it? - Hello, Ms. Tremaine. - Hello, Moses. Hello, Mr. Flowers. Praise thee, you're getting well. Hello, Baby. That is one heck of a handsome sofa you have there. Don't touch it. That's my birthday present on account of today is my birthday. Oh, I had no idea! Oh, it's you. Baby, come on. I want to put you under the dryer. I'm gonna get the curlers off my head. So, I'm gonna look like an angel. You look awful nice today, Ms. Tremaine. Thank you. Well, I understand that they had to fire that janitor. - They? - Hmm. Well, aren't we just a little Harper Valley hypocrite. Nathan, get off the couch for heaven's sake.. Here, you be in charge of streamers and balloons. Aye-aye, captain. I don't wanna mess it up before Mrs. Crow even sees it. I'm sorry. (Claire) 'Now, everything's under control.' Where is the god damn teacher? [doorbell rings] (female #1) 'It's Mrs. Crow from the penitentiary' Speak of the devil and she shall ring your doorbell. Oh, Mrs. Crow. - How nice to see you again. - Yes. Won't you come in? Uh, I don't think you've met my dear friend Teresa Tremaine. - I've heard so much about you. - Oh, thank you. Yes, well, Baby is a fountain of information. Perhaps, she told you about Mr. Flowers. (Mrs. Crow) 'No.' It's my pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Crow. Claire has spoken so very, very much about you. Yes. Well, Mrs. Crow, do you notice anything new? I see you got a new couch. Come here and sit by me. Oh, what a lovely hat. Oh, and a wrist corsage. Yes, I just got back from out of town. It looks like everyone's here. So, why don't we begin? Yes, why don't we just put the gaiety on hold for a second and I'll get Baby. Now, I want you to close your eyes and don't open 'em till I tell you. - Okay. - Okay? Now, don't expect nothing special. I won't. Okay. Oh, this is gonna look good. [whispering] Now, do exactly what I told you. (all) 'Surprise!' My teacher's in my house. Yeah, it's a surprise party, Baby. You have made surprise party for me? - Yeah. - That's right. And you made my teacher to be here for me? - Yes. - That's right. And you puted up colored papers for me? - Yes, baby. - It's a surprise party. And you got doritos for me? - Happy birthday. - Happy birthday, Baby. - Happy birthday. - Happy birthday. Yay! Look at you, sweet doll. Now, I want you to come over here and sit next to Mrs. Crow. Right over there. That's good. (Claire) 'Ah-ah-ah, put your feet on the floor. Okay.' Good. Nice. What, Teresa? We open the presents? Teresa, where is the god damn C-L-O-N with the C-A-K? Don't worry, honey. Here. Open this, it's from me. A present for me? What is it? - Mama, look. Perfume. - Ooh. My...sin. Mr. Flowers, my sin. This is from me, Baby. I hope you like it. What is it? [whispering] What is it? Mama, look. A fish. Mrs. Crow got me a fish. Just what we need around here. Fish. Oh, I'm gonna call her...Todd. And I gonna be chattin' her all the time. Well, here, say thank you. Make a pretty curtsy. Get up. Thank you for my present, Mrs. Crow. Bye, Todd. See you later, alligator. Is there anymore presents? No, that's it for now, Baby. Teresa. [doorbell rings] I wonder who that could be. (all) 'Ooh!' (Baby) 'Who is it?' (Claire) 'Joe!' Joe? Magnuson, you are not welcome at this celebration. Joe, what the hell are you doing here? - He's with me. - With you? That's right, peaches. The bug is back. Here, princess. A present from me and my wife. - Your wife! - That's right, peaches. Me and Doddy just got back from Vegas. Got ourselves legally hitched. How do you like that? You make a beautiful couple. All we've come to do is claim what is rightfully mine. Namely one certain little princess. Now, no no. Say here, Magnuson-- And my name is on a list that says I can do just that. It's all legal like. We only want what's best for the child. Mom, am I going on a trip? Over my rotting corpse. Nathan, tell 'em. Claire and I are engaged. - Really? - That's right. I'm the natural mother. My apartment is clean. I got a new couch and I'm soon to be married to a god fearing man. A god damn pillar of the community. Gee! And it seems like only yesterday that me and Claire would play, "Ride the Bull." - What? - What! Maybe, I should give him all them love letters you wrote me? Here, pal. I won't be needing these anymore. No. Nathan, give those letters to me this instant. Wait till hear about the couch. - Nathan. - Couch? If you love me, you won't read those. Claire, I can't help myself. "Every dripping ounce of your love.." "Perched upon your throbbing.." Claire, you Judas...whore! Especially whore. Nathan, these letters, look, are obvious forges-- Thou shalt not lie. Thou has committed adultery. Thou has borne false witness against me. And satan co-operated. Now, you're getting melodramatic. You'll marry a plague of flies. - Now, cut that out. - A plague of frogs. That's disgusting. I'll send in plague of boils on you, Claire. Gods strike her dead. Joe, get her things. Baby, you're coming with me and your father. No, I don't want to go anywhere. Mama, no. - The child is mine. - Oh, you let go of her. Pull, Doddy. [indistinct chattering] [doorbell rings] Happy birthday, everyone. It's me. Rainbow Smiles. And I've got an itch, I can't scratch! - Mama, look. - Alright. Alright, everybody. This is my clown for my kid. So, back off. You've got one minute. - So, where's the birthday boy? - It's me. Well, ain't you cute? Here we go, honey. We're gonna party all night. * What you see Is what you got ** [upbeat music] Oh, watch out now. That's my wife. * Mm, yeah ** Look, there's Rainbow Smiles dancing in my house. * I want you doable * Ow! Ow! * And that room is full of strangers * Ah! Oh, Mama, look. I got her glove. Oh, Baby, that's good. That's good dancing. * And I'd keep her too busy * Oh, my god! Father, forgive her. She knows not what she's done. She knows exactly what she's doing. [howling] Mama, I riding a pony. She loves it, look at her. Oh yeah, hell, she doesn't know the difference. - Oh. - Oh. [screaming] - Oh. - Thats' it. Enough! Smiles, you were great. You were just wonderful. Come on. 'Break time.' How come you never come to our-- [screaming] Help me! - Claire! - You need to pay me money. Mama! You went walking. It's the big one. Whore! Somebody called for a whore? Run now! (Claire) 'My baby!' Now, give me my child. The list say's that my husband is one of Baby's fathers. - Yeah. - Gimme that list. If Baby has to go with somebody, I'll choose who the father is. (Baby) Mama.. Here...Harlem Jewel. He's deceased. He died in the earthquake. They never found his body. I'll search to the ends of the earth till I find him. He wasn't like you. Harlem was kind, he was sensitive. Sometimes, when I'd pass by his cubicle in the sperm bank he'd be playing a Barbra Streisand album and.. ...if I listened real hard.. ...I could hear it in him inside softly crying. (Teresa singing Memories) * Memories * * Like the corners of my mind * [all gasping] Mama wh.. Baby! Baby, look! It's Harlem. Harlem, they said you were dead. They said he was dead. Harlem is dead darlin' When that sperm bank caved in on me.. ...I thought I'd never get out alive. But, I clawed my way out.. ...found a pair of heels and I've never looked back. I'm sorry I never told you, Claire. I knew you'd loved Harlem. Everytime I came in, I could see it in your eyes. But, I didn't want to be Harlem. The day that Harlem Jewel died.. ...is the day, Teresa Tarmay, was born. This is outrageous! And I shall continue to live my life as I please. And I choose to give, Baby to somebody who'll love her. Baby, come 'ere! Harlem.. Teresa.. ...take her and take care of her. He's not married. But he will be. Teresa's had an offer of marriage from a man - who-who speaks fluent spanish. - A...Claire. Ravio did propose to me last night but.. ...immigration paid me a visit this morning. He didn't love me, he only wanted a green card. - So, I said no. - Ha! Gimme that child! Wait a minute, wait! A minute! Teresa.. ...you and I would make a good team. Lesbians! Lesbians? Honey, I know a couple of lesbians who would love to beat the shit out of you. (Claire giggling) Teresa...I would be proud to be your wife. And vice-versa. Can-can me and Carl be on the team too? - Oh, Baby. - Of, course, Baby. You haven't seen the last of me. I told you to clear out of here. Yeah, clear out, janitor. And take that dump truck with ya! Come on you miserable worm. [sighing] Come on, let's get out of here. - The movies almost startin' - Oh, boy! [intense music] Lord, if I had the trials and tribulations of living on planet of the apes. Well, girls... I gotta get going. Baby, I want you to make sure your mother wakes up early tomorrow morning. 'Cause we got a 10 'O clock appointment at wedding world.. ...and I just know we're gonna fight just a little while over that white wedding dress. Well, goodbye, girls. Muah. Muah. - Goodbye, Teresa. - Bye, Teresa. Teresa's gonna be our new daddy? That's right. Rainbow Smiles catched her boyfriend. Rainbow "caught" a boyfriend. Rainbow caught a boyfriend. If you were like, Zira the ape girl you could catch yourself a bunch of boyfriends. But, they'd all be apes, Baby. Did you make a nice wish when you blew out those candles. Yes. What did you wish for? I wished for, Todd to come back. Yeah, it's a damn shame, that fish is missing already. It must have jumped right out of the bag and straight into the toilet. She must've. Fish gotta be free, Baby. I know. 'So, did you wish for anything else?' You mean, you can get two? Sometimes. I also wished for pom-poms. - Like these? - Yes, Mama, yes! Oh, pom-poms. Oh, Mama, I love you more than fish and more than pom-poms - and more than everything. - Oh. And you lived happily ever after, afterwards? For the most part, yes. Hi, Sweetie. Mommy, it's, Grandma and Grandma. Here, sweetie. We brought you a little birthday present. Yes, we thought you might like something nice. What with your, Pa, shooting himself and all. A pom-pom outfit. I had to pick it out myself. Teresa was to busy making love to the stock boy. Oh, poo, we just kissed, that's all. Sweetie.. ...sweetie, I want you to do your mama one of them - pom-pom dances. - Get out on this floor. You do me one of 'em pom-pom cheers, come on. A hundred and one. Eleventy-two. Three and four and six and eight. Oh, we gonna be tear up 'em up. What do you think you're doing to us. Nine and eight and twelve and one. We gonna fight. We Indians, baby. Oh, my heart's just gonna bust wide open. * Don't want nothing fancy * * Don't need nothin' new * * Nothing too expensive * * Just a sinful life with you * * Give me something borrowed * * I'll buy you something blue * * I'll trade this life for sorrow * * For a sinful life with you * * Sinful Life * * Sinful life with you * * No promises of paradise * * Just a sinful life with you *
