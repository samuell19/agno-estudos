- I'm tellin' you, man. The perfect rib can't just fall off the bone. It's gotta have a little chew to it. - Maybe Sarge will let us take a poke at one of them mountain goats. Have a little Afghan barbecue. - Can you guys talk about something other than food? Hang in there, Nelson. We get home in a couple weeks, Amber and I will take you to the church barbecue. - Come on, Sarge.

And, you know, the race world is still buzzing about Cody Jackson's monstrous crash at the DAV 200. The video's gone viral, and it's insane out there. Eddie, what's happened to Coach Gibbs' golden boy? - I think, Joe, you'd have to ask Coach Gibbs that. I don't know. What I do know is everyone's coming down on him. And I don't think it's fair. I think he's a tremendous talent. - They don't try to split three cars and take the leader on the high side up in the marbles on the turn. - Hand me a 9/16 box end, would you? - Heard me comin', right? - The whole neighborhood did. You must be Cody. Joe Cartier. - That's a nice ride. - It sure is. And I'd like to keep it that way. Word is, you might have some trouble with that. - Rubbing is racing, right? - No, it isn't, and this isn't a box end. Grab that box. We don't want to be late. - Late for what? - Church! - Church? - Bree, did you get your Bible? - Yeah, I have it. - Whoa, there. - Can I help you? - Are you Amber Hill? - Yeah, I'm Amber. - You've been served. - Who was that? - Never mind. It doesn't matter. Come on. Let's go. Let's get in the car. - There you go. Good morning. Good morn... morning. - Are you gonna pick me up after church? - No. You're gonna stay at Hannah's. - Okay. - Bree! You forgot your treat. - I wish you would stay. - I know, but momma's got to go to work today. - Okay. - Hey, Bree! What'cha got there? - Who's that? - She's out of your league. - Mmm. What'cha got? - Crazy Krispies. - Ooh, Crazy Krispies looks good! Morning, Joe. - Hey, Karena. This is Cody Jackson. He just volunteered to head up our youth outreach program. - Oh! Well, nice to meet you, Cody. - Nice to meet you. I did what? ♪ - Good morning, Miss Bree. - Hi, Hannah. - Is your mom coming? - So glad you could make it in. - I am so... - Save it. Not interested. - Hey, did you have a chance to think that shift manager position? - Why don't you try being on time for the job you have first? - I have a question for you. What happens when the plans you had for your life don't pan out? Some people blame God. They give up on God. They stop praying. They stop reading His word, stop going to His church. Do you see all those empty seats around you? Those are missing brothers and sisters. Love calls us to bring them home. They need to know that God is not done with them, that He has not abandoned them. God wants them to come back to Him. And, if they are willing to turn to him with just the tiniest seed of faith... he will show them that nothing is impossible. - "Truly, I tell to you "if you have faith the size of a mustard seed "you will say this to the mountain. "Move from here to there, and it will move, "and nothing will be impossible for you." - Thank you, David. Can anyone see what I'm holding? This is a mustard seed. It's one of the tiniest seeds in the world, but when you plant it a huge, strong tree can grow from it. That's a pretty powerful seed, isn't it? So what Jesus was saying was even the tiniest little bit of faith can make a difference in our lives and in the lives of our friends and family because our faith... can help us lead others to God. - Well, it's really great to see you, Monica. - It's good to see you, too. - How are things going? - Great. Can't complain. Super busy. Just landed a huge client, got promoted to V.P. - Wow. That's fantastic. - Table seven is ready for coffee refills. Ten is ready to order, and your mother-in-law's at table five. - Well, good luck with table five. - Thanks. Morning, Patti. Would you like coffee? - It's nice to see you, Amber. Shame I have to come all the way down here to do it. - Coffee? - How's Bree? - She's good. What would you like? - I'd like to spend more time with my granddaughter. - And to eat? - Has she visited Darren's grave yet? - If she asks, I'll take her. - She's eight. You have to do these things for her. You set the tone. Where is Bree today? - She's at church. It just seems to me that Bree could benefit from a more consistent home life. - And that is exactly what I am giving her. - By working seven days a week? - That is something I have to do right now. - Why? I'm... I didn't come here to pick a fight. I came to make you an offer. - With eye shadow and lip gloss? - Amber, I'd like to help you set up your own franchise. - You can make good money as an independent consultant. You can quit working here and be home with Bree. - I've got this under control. - We have our differences. We do. But I think we can agree that Bree is the most important thing in the world to both of us. - Tell Bree I said hi. - Looks like Joe's youth outreach program is going to be a big hit. - What kid wouldn't want to hang out with a race car driver? - All right, here we go! Come on. Closer, closer. Don't push. Step a little closer. Don't push. Okay, cowboy. Help me with this. One, two, three! Hoo-ah! How do ya like that, huh? Okay, who wants to take this puppy for a spin? Oh, everybody. All right. Here we go! That's it. You got it. Doing great! That's great! Go for it! Good job. Get that curve, now. To the left, to the right. That's it! Oh, man. You are a natural! Good work, Dean. Nice try. All right, Codebreaker. You wanna punch in and coach up our next driver? Here we go! Let's do it! - Are you gonna help us build our own go-carts? Yeah, it looks like it's gonna be part of my prison sentence. - Prison? Do you know David's uncle? - He's doing a stretch in Jackson. We pray for him. - Do they cost anything? - Does what cost anything? - Building the go-carts. - I don't think so. It's my first day, so I'm not really sure. - Is it a manual or automatic? - How fast will they go? - Okay, you know what? You just sit in the car, hold your foot to the pedal... and you steer around the cones. That's all there is to it. You got it? - Got it. - Amber! - Hey, Sergeant Price. Hi. - How you holding up? - We're doing okay. Taking it day by day. - Let me get this for you. - Thanks. I'm just right over here. - How's Bree? - She's doing good. - What grade's she in now? - She's in fourth. - Oh. They do grow up fast. - Yeah, they sure do. - Listen, we got a lot of great activities on the base for kids. You should bring Bree around sometime. - Sure. Sounds fun. Thank you. - You're family, Amber. We got your back. - And my friend Allie, she went really fast, and David drove into three cones in a row. And then when it was my turn to... - Whoa, watch it! Come on, Bree. Watch what you're doing. - Sorry, mom. - What is that, anyway? - That's my mustard seed. - Your what? - My mustard seed. I planted it in Sunday school. And Jesus says if you just have a little faith, then this tiny seed could grow into the biggest tree in the world. - Hmm. - And, in science class, I learned that plants like to be talked to. So he needs a name. - He? - Yeah. I can't just call him, "Hey, seed." Matthew! Matt for short. Where should we keep him? - I don't know, honey. Some seeds just don't grow where we live. - Mom... This one will. - What makes you think she's out of my league? - Amber is still recovering from the loss of her husband. - How'd he die? - Afghanistan. I just don't think you're what she needs right now. Anyway, you got other things to worry about, like a race to prepare for. - I really don't know what Coach Gibbs is hoping to get from this little trip back to the minors. - Yeah. Me either. If you were my driver, I would have just fired you. - So what can I get you tonight? - I'm sorry. Um... I'm sorry. I'll just get... the meatloaf, um... fries. - Fries. Anything to drink? - Water's fine. Thank you. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm good. I'm good. Is... Is Amber working tonight? - No, I'm sorry. - Mrs. Hill? - I can pick up extra shifts at the diner. I... I'm really doing everything that I can. - Let me explain what's about to happen. You've already been served your second foreclosure notice. If you miss one more payment, there are only two options. You can short sale your home, and... - Sell my home? No, I'm not gonna sell my home. - Then the bank will be forced to take possession. - Thank you very much for your time. - Mom? Mom! - Hmm? - Do you have one of dad's patches? - Probably. What for? - For my go-cart. - For your what? - The go-cart club at church. - Oh, right. Does that cost any money? - No. - Yeah, there should be a patch in that photo album. - Okay. - Hey! - Hey, Amber. - Is that... - Ziti! - Get in here. - You know it. - Bridge, that was so good. - Plenty for leftovers this week. - Yes, it was absolutely amazing. Thank you. This is such a nice surprise. - Yeah, we need to do this more often. - We miss you, Amber. - Hey kiddo, I think it's time to get ready for bed. - Mom, could you sing to me tonight? - Not tonight, Bree. - Please? Just one song. - Bed. I'll come tuck you in in a few minutes, okay? - You never want to sing for me. - Bed. Now. - Okay. - Goodnight. - Love you. Night, sweets. - Goodnight. - So when do we get to hear that beautiful voice again? - Seriously, the choir needs your help. We're a disaster without you. - I wouldn't even know where to start. - Start with a prayer. - Amber, we know you're still hurting, but it's times like these you... you really need to lean on your faith. - I tried putting my faith in God. Look where it got me. - But, Amber, God's still with you, blessing you every step of the way. - Even when it doesn't feel like it sometimes. - You're right. It doesn't feel like it. I don't understand why he would do that to us. To Bree. I'm not ready to trust him with our lives again. - Amber... - No, you know what? I really appreciate all that you guys have done. I really do. But I got this. If he wants me, he knows where to find me. - Good night, kiddo. I love you. - Did you think of a name yet? - Yep! - Cody! - Hey, Cody! Hey! - The Screaming Eagle. My dad was the 101st Airborne. What do you think? - I think he would love it. What color do you want to paint it? - I like pink, but I like camo. Pink camo. - You got it. - Let's get started! - There you go! Let's go! - He was asking about you again last night. - Who? - The wheelchair fella. Said he needed to talk to you about something? But he wouldn't say what it was. - Thanks, Rosie. - Grandma! - Hey! Oh! Grandma, Cody and I are building a go-cart. - Yeah? And who's Cody? - Cody Jackson, ma'am. Pleasure to meet you. - Oh. Yeah. Patti Hill. Nice to meet you. How long have you been workin' for Joe? - Cody is a racecar driver, grandma. I guess mom's working late... again. - Yeah. She's taking another shift at Rosie's tonight. Guess she ran out of options if she had to call me, huh? - Rosie's? Out on Old 37? - Yeah. They have great pancakes. - Go grab your things, sweetheart. - Bye, David. - Bye, Bree. - Looks like I've got you all to myself tonight. - Hi. - Hi. - Can I help you? - Yeah, um... I hear you got great pancakes. - We do. - I'm Cody. We saw each other at church. I know your daughter. - Oh, that's right. You're the go-cart builder. - Actually, I'm... I'm a race car driver. I'm just helping Joe out for a bit. Well, it's nice to meet you. Would you like bacon or sausage with your pancakes? - Um... bacon. - Done. Anything else? - Yeah. Look, um, I'm new to town, and I just thought it might be nice to... get to know someone outside of Joe and a bunch of kids. - Yeah, that sounds... That sounds really nice. But it's just not a good time for me. - Okay. - I'll put this order in for you. - Hey, Matt. Let's see how you're doing. Oh, you have the perfect amount of water, but you feel really cold. Let me get you a sweater. That'll warm you up. Goodnight, Matt. Hi, God. Please say hi to my dad up in heaven... and make my mom feel better because I really miss hearing her sing. Oh, and please make Matt grow. Amen. - Did you brush your teeth? Good job! Oh, I love you so much. Oh! - I love you too so much. - Good night, peanut. - Good night. - Sweet dreams. - Announcer: Bad credit, no credit, apply now, get paid now.

How was she? - Oh, an angel. - Oh, good. Thank you again for coming by. I know it was last minute. - Oh, anytime. Who's this Cody? - I don't know. We just met. - Oh. What happened to the leather couch? - You know, it just felt too big for the two of us, so... - And the dining room set? - You know what, Patti? I'm-I'm really tired. I've had a long day. - Oh. Your daughter needs more food in this house. - Not a bad lap. Okay, setup for turn four. Now, Cody, I want you to push the apex of the turn as late as possible. Hold the line high, and delay your entry point. - Too many words, Joe. I failed geometry. - Cody, this is not geometry. This is the ABC's of racing. - Very funny. - Cody, I want you to give me that sharper turn, and it will give you more speed into the straightaway. - All right. I'll set it up on the next lap. - You're coming in too hot. - What, you want me to slow down? - Yes. But you won't be able to. Cody, you cannot make that sharper turn at full speed. You will spin out every time. - This is stupid, Joe. This whole idea of coming down here. Going slow is not going to win me a race. I'd rather crash than lose. - Okay, these two check out, so let's get 'em in the safe, okay? - I'll get right on it. - All right. Hello, there. - Hi. - What can I do for you? - I need to borrow some money. - Um, do you have something to pawn? - No, I don't. - No? Well, how much do you need? - I need $800. - All right. It's 38% interest. And you pay it in two weeks. - Yeah. - Okay? And I need your signature right there. And I'm gonna have to see a credit card and ID please. All righty. Perfect. Will you be able to cover the next payment in two weeks? - I can do it. - I don't know where you came up with this, but there are no shortcuts in your situation. You need to consider selling your house. - That's the only thing that Darren left me. I'm not giving up without a fight. - We're just about to wrap things up. - Yeah. - I'll go get her. - Wait. Just a sec. - Mom! Come see! Come see! - Hi, sweetie. What are you doing? - Painting the Screaming Eagle. - Wow. - All right, kids. Just a couple more minutes, then we're gonna clean up. It's really fantastic, Bree. - Thanks. Ooh, I have to lock up the carts. - Okay, that's fine. I can meet you out front. - Actually, can I walk home with David? - Sure. Yeah, that's fine. I have an errand I have to run anyway. Just be home for dinner? - Okay. - Hey! - Hey. - So... what do you think? - I'm super-impressed. I have not seen her that happy in a really long time. - Well, she's a great kid. - Yeah. She really is. - There's a... There's a great band playing at Harry's tomorrow night. You wanna go check 'em out? - Yes. Yes, I would like that. - Okay, great. - Okay. I'll pick you up at 8:00? - Yeah. That sounds great. - Okay, great. - Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. - Okay. Now this is a very big step for her. So if anything happens, you call me first, okay? - Got it. - We're gonna need a little help. - Bridgette!? - Okay, okay. Okay, got it. Got it, got it, got it. Coming!

Those highlights you gave me? Come on. Come on. Just... - You went full-on orange. - Oh my gosh. But my hair was the least of my worries. Remember my date? - Oh my... Matt Smootech! No, no, let's not talk about it. Let's, let's not talk about it. - Oh... I'm just not sure I should be doing this. - It's just coffee. Okay? - I know, but it just somehow feels like I'm being disloyal. - Amber, look at me. I know this is a big step for you. I know. It's okay. It's just coffee. - Hi, Cody. - Hey, there. - Mom! Cody's here! You could come in. - Thank you! - Hi. - Hi. You look incredible. - Thanks. - He must have been an amazing man. - Yeah, he was. - Can I ask you what happened to him? - He died while he was on patrol with his team. I haven't really asked beyond that. Should we go? - Yeah. - Okay. - Yeah, let's go. - I told mom Matt would grow. - You'll have to show her when she gets home. This is really beautiful, Bree. You should bring him in and show them to the other kids at Sunday school. - I will. One second. - What are you doing? - Matt loves his music. - Come on.

We're gonna have to see some kind of collateral. - Okay. Eh, it's only a third of a karat. But flawless. Who dumped who? - Excuse me? - Well, the way I see it is that he cared enough about you to pick the best diamond he could afford. Not some low-quality large stone to try and impress you. - What's it worth? - He ain't gonna come in here looking for this ring, is he? I mean, I don't get involved with messy break-ups. - He was killed in Afghanistan, so I think the chances of him coming in here looking for that ring are pretty low. - Okay. - Grandma's here!

Let's watch from the top of the trailer. Best seats in the house. - Sounds good, Joe. Come on. Good luck. - Thanks. - Yeah. - And welcome to race night here at Berlin. We have a heck of a main event for you here this evening. - That's right, John. Cody Jackson makes his return to the track after his spectacular crash at the DAV 200 just weeks ago. - Spectacular, indeed. In fact, horrifying. Many people thought his career was over. And we're underway. - What about you, partner? You see that new paint job? - Sure did. It looks great. - Well let's try to keep some of it on the car. - Cody, watch number 15. He's getting a little loose out there. - Yeah, I got him. - Yeah, Cody! - Cody! - Cody, you've been coming into the turns a little hot. Don't get too aggressive here at the end. - There's no trophy for 4th place, Joe. - Cody, back it off on the turns. You can't keep making moves like that. - Settle down. I know what I'm doing. - If Jackson can keep this pace, he might just challenge Cofflin for the checkered flag. - Stay focused. Wait for your opportunity. Use that sharper turn into the curve to set up your line. - I'm not gonna back off now, Joe. Not now. - Great. Get your tools ready, guys. - It's go time. - Announcer: Cofflin and Jackson neck and neck, and he is thinking about... Oh, no! He's losing it! - My god. - He's in trouble, folks! - Cofflin goes under the checkered flag in first place, followed by... then Crump, but everybody's eyes are on the in-field, and I hope that Jackson is all right. - Cody! - Bree! - Bree! No! No! You stay here with your mom. It's gonna be okay. He'll be okay. Get him out guys. Get him out! - Cody! - Bree, I'm all right. I'm all right, Bree. I'm okay. - Come on, Bree. We're going home. - Mom! What are you doing? - Bree. Come on. - Mom. - I had a clear line. - Guys, give us a minute, will ya? You see that scrap heap? That's what's gonna become of your life if you don't learn to... - Listen, and slow down on the turn. I know. - Oh you know, but you don't get it. This isn't about the turn. Did you see the look on Amber's face? Racing is dangerous enough without you adding recklessness to the mix. If you care for them, show it. They've lost enough already. You got that? - Come on, Bree! We can't be late for school! - I couldn't find my helmet. - That's okay. You can leave your helmet. We're not going to go-cart club anymore. - Why not? - 'Cause I said so. - But my cart's almost done, and I really want... - No more racing. - What?! Mom! - Don't argue with me. Leave it. - No! - Now we're gonna be late! Get in the car. - What is that sign for? - Miss? Miss? Can I help you? - Why was there an auction sign in my front lawn this morning? - Mrs. Hill, I'm sorry. I... - It's not the full amount, but it's everything that I've got. - Amber. - Pay the lender. Stop the foreclosure, please. I have fought too hard for this. - This is no way for you and your daughter to live. - You ready, kiddo? - Mm-hmm. - Is Matt ready? - I think so. Do you think the new house will be better for him? - We'll see. Shall we? - I know it's a bit of an adjustment Amber, but... - Yeah, with a little elbow grease, it'll feel like home before dinner. - Can I go inside, now? - Yeah. Go inside. - This could be a good home. I mean, maybe not what you were expecting, but... - I just wish that I could see it. - Well, you have to have a little faith to see it. - It's still there, Amber. Buried but fighting. Kinda like that little sprout in Bree's pot. - That plant's not gonna grow, Bridge. - Well, give it some time, Amber. I mean, whether you believe it or not, God's got you in the palm of his hand. - We got you, too. - Thanks, girls. - Come on. - Okay. ♪ - I'm trying to help them, Darren. I just... I don't know what to do. I miss you so much. - Dear heavenly Father Lord, we come to you now to pray for our friend, Amber. We know that where two or more are gathered you are here, and we know that you are here with us. Please reveal yourself to her, Lord. Shine your grace down upon her. Soften her heart. Please help grow that seed of faith that we know is still there in her heart, Lord. - Boogedy boogedy. Make it happen at Joe's Auto Repair! That's my girl! Come on, to the inside. To the inside. Yeah, you got it. You got it. David, come on! Take the inside line. Just take the inside line. Hold him off, Bree. Come on, David. - Yeah, yeah! That's it! Way to go, Bree! There you go. Lead that turn, David! - All right, guys. - Five laps to go. - Whoo! All right! Bree, what's wrong? Hey, I've been trying to call you. - Let's go. I told you you are done with this. - I don't want to go! This is not fair. - Get in the van. - Amber. Wait a minute. Amber! What's going on? - This doesn't concern you. - You never let me do anything! - That's not true! - Then how come the only time I have fun is when you're not around? - You know what, Bree? I'm doing the best I can. I really am. - Dad would want me to do this. - Yeah, well he's gone, all right? You're stuck with me! - I hate you! I wish you died instead of dad! Bree? Bree? Bree, open the door, please. I want to talk to you. Bree. Bree! Bree! Bree! Bree! - Bree! - Bree! - Bree, make a noise if you can, sweetheart! - Breeanne Hill! - Bree, honey! It's okay. Please come out. Please? Please, baby. I'm not mad at you! I just want you to come out. Please! - Bree! - What have I done, Bridge? - Bree! Bree! - Listen, Ams... - Bree! When we're in our most hopeless moments... the Lord is closest to us. He hears you, okay? - Where are you, Bree? - Okay, everyone. We're gonna canvas this area. Stay close together. Call in if you find anything. Karena and I will be here working the phones. - Pray as you search, people. - Work in pairs. Check in every 30 minutes. We will find her. - Cody. You'll do her more good searching for Bree. - Hey, can I go with you, Cody? - Yeah, of course. - Yeah. Why don't y'all take the alley south to 7th Street. Let's go. - Bree, come out, honey! - We're gonna find that little stinker, okay? - Bree! - Heavenly Father... - It's pretty hard to find her if you're not out looking! Why is it that I have to find out from Facebook that my own granddaughter is missing?! - Patti, I can't do this right now. - Oh, I... - Patti, Patti. - I have all of my associates and every customer for three counties ready to go. Where haven't we looked? - Bree? Bree, come on, sweetie. Where are you? Let's go, guys. Look everywhere. We gotta move it. Bree! - I heard you were in Darren's unit. - Yeah. He saved my life. - Does Amber know that? - I don't think so. - Maybe she should. - Unit 65 to Central Dispatch, making a stop. Copy. - Copy that, Unit 65. - License and registration, please. - How fast was I going? - Bree! Bree! Honey, we've been looking for you all night! - Hi, yeah, yeah, Karena, she's here. I just got here. Yes, thank you! Thank you! - Oh! - Bree! Oh, sweetie. - You all set, Miss Patti? - Thank you Brice. - Thank you so much. - My pleasure. Bree, your cart will be at Joe's. - Thanks, Officer Brice. - You're welcome. You all have a good night. - Goodnight. - Sweetie, you can't ever do that to me ever, ever again, okay? You had me worried sick. Now come on. We've had a long night. Let's get you home. - No. - What? - I wanna stay here. - Sweetie, we're not gonna stay at grandma's tonight. - But I wanna live with her. - You what? - You know, we're all exhausted here. Maybe it's okay for the night. - Patti, my daughter's gonna stay with me tonight. - No, I'm not. - Bree, go on up. - How dare you! - I think it's best if everyone has a little space. - Bree! Bree, I'm not gonna force you, but... - Amber, she came to me. - Patti, please! - Go home. We all need to get some rest. - First you take Darren! Then you take my home! And now you turned my daughter against me! Please. I believed in your goodness! We gave you everything. Our love, our devotion. Why? Why would you take my husband? Why would you leave my daughter without her father? Where's my reward for my faith, God?! What are you gonna do to fix it? Please. Please Lord. I can't do this. I can't do this. I need you. Where are you? - She's just hurting. We'll figure this out, Amber. - Amber. - Mike has something he's been wanting to tell you. - We'll be right outside if you need us. - Sergeant Hill, he was... He was the closest thing I ever had to a father. We were on patrol. - Lock and load. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop! Stop! - There's nothing good for us here, Sarge. - Let's not borrow trouble. Eyes and ears, boys. Full security. You know the drill. - RPG! - Ah! - Allahu akbar! - Fire! - Cover the ridge! Nelson! - Get those doors open! - Cease fire, now! Ah! - Nelson! - I'm hit! I'm hit! - I got you, kid! - Ah! - Get him outta there! - Ooh! Come on. - Here! - You stay with me, kid. Sarge! Sarge! - Sarge. You saved me. You saved me. You're loved... more than you could ever imagine. - Sarge? Sarge? I am sorry... he chose to save me... rather than come home to you... and your daughter. - His faith gave him the courage to... to do the impossible. - He made this... from the shrapnel of our first firefight. It belongs to you. See, he saved more... than just my life. - Can we talk? - Sure. Come on. - And it hit me that Darren was your loss, too. I mean, I lost my husband, but you lost your son. And I'm so sorry. - Thank you for saying that. - I mean, I'm not gonna pretend that we don't have our issues, but I'm... I'm willing to make an honest effort if you are. - Darren loved you very much. This is a family heirloom. Let's... Let's try to protect it... so it's here for Bree when she needs it. Okay? - Thank you. Hey. Bree, I owe you an apology. - You do? - I do. And there's something that I want us to do together. - Bree, sweetie. We have one more letter to read from your daddy. It came a couple days after the soldiers came to tell me that he had passed away. I just couldn't open it. - It's okay, mommy. We can open it together. - Okay. - "Dear Amber... and Bree... "This will be the last letter "you get before I come home. "So I guess I'd better make it a good one. "If I've learned anything in the last 14 months apart, "it's this. "When you choose Him, he takes care of your fears. "It can be hard to do that every day, especially here, "but I try because this road leads to Him "and back to you. "See you soon. "I love you with all of my heart, Darren." I've just been hurting so bad. I lost sight of the most important blessing he ever gave me. - The house? - No, sweetie. You. Thank you. - I'm sorry that I said that I hate you. - That's okay sweetie. I know you didn't mean it. Lord, please give us the courage to put our love into action, just like Darren did. Thank you for leading me back to my family. - I thought I was gonna teach you guys about racing when I first got here. But it turns out I actually learned more from you. For the longest time, I thought... I thought racing was only about going fast. But racing, like life, is about knowing when to go fast and knowing when to take your foot off the pedal and have faith. Because, if we go too fast, we might not notice the blessings that are right there in front of us. All right? So let's, let's bring it in, okay? Okay, drivers.
