[overture music] [male narrator] Who of us will ever know what it's in the heart of a dog. This is the story of a great love. The love of a dog for one man. A love that was to prove even stronger than life itself. [wind howling] [man whistling] [male #1] 'Hello!' 'Shep.' 'Hello!' 'Shep.' 'Hello, Shep.' [dog barking] [rocks cracking] [male #1] 'Shep!' 'Where are you, girl?' [dog barking] 'Hurry up!' 'Get me out of this mess.' Hey, hey, never mind eating me. Just get me out of here. Start diggin'. Go on! 'That's it. Start diggin'' 'Atta girl, keep her flying.' Hey, hey, the other way. The other way. 'The other way, Shep.' No, no. Dig, dig. Dig. Keep diggin'. That's a million dollar dirt. We've hit it this time, Shep. 'We've hit it sure.' No. Keep going. 'I forgot to pier the shaft up.' I'm darn near being the richest corpse in the territory. [chuckling] Come on, girl, we're heading for town. Just wait till you see Frank Blake's eyes when we tell him he's a millionaire. [mellow music] [Shep barking] [barking continues] - Bye! - Bye! So long! Merry Christmas. 'Hello, Steve.' Well, Jonathan, how are you? Merry Christmas. How about it? On the house. - No. - How about you, pup? [barking] 'They can't call you pup anymore, can they, fella?' You can't call her fella neither. Say, that's right. Excuse me, beautiful. Well, how's it going, Jonathan? Shep and me ain't complainin'. Uh, Steve, has Frank being around tonight? Frank? Frank Blake? Be right back. Thanks, Steve. I'm out. Jonathan Harvey? - That's right. - I'm Lin Taylor. Sorry, we couldn't let you know it, Jonathan. Martha wanted to. There was no way of finding you in time. Time for what? Frank's death, Jonathan. Over a month ago, in the morning. Tommy worries me, Jonathan. Do you know that he's never once cried? If he could just let it out. We'll work it out, Martha. We'll find a way. Well right now, what about this fella Taylor? Lin's a fine man. He's been wonderful. Why did Frank take him in his apartment? He had to. Lin's buying in when he did kept us from losing everything. I see. Does that make him a partner of grubstake rights? Yes, why? Jonathan, you've made a strike! I've got something to show you. [knocking on the door] - Lin. - Hello, Martha. Come in. Jonathan's inside. I'm glad you're here. Jonathan has something to show us. Yeah. Look at this. I found a vein of that. If it's deep enough, it could be the biggest strike this territory has ever seen. That's why we got to file a claim and quick. File before it's approved? You file now and word gets out that you struck ore like this? Every claim jump in the territory will be on those hills in a week. Before you're sure that you've hit the main vein. By God, you're right. Thirty years of much scrabbling and when I do find a glory dust, I go off half cocked. Mr. Taylor, Martha's right about you. Right now, you can start workin' at being a partner by lining me up some supplies. Of course, Jonathan, anything you need. Meet you in the store in a half hour. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Lin. If it's alright with you, I'd like to talk with, Tommy? Alright, Jonathan. If there's anything you can do.. [melancholic music] Tommy. Tommy. Hey, Jonathan. Jonathan. Oh, Jonathan! Why did he have to die? Easy, boy. 'I want my pa, Jonathan. I want pa!' Sure you do. But there's something's we can't answer, Tommy. The Lord's got his ways of doing things, we just can't answer. I didn't wanna cry. You go ahead and cry. I used to do it myself sometimes.. ...before my tears all dried up on me. Now, how about Shep here? Those hills up there.. ..that's no place for a dog. At least not Shep. - It isn't? - No, not too lonesome. She likes folks around. In fact, she's just plain ain't happy up there. Uh, as for me, I'm better off alone. Lots of times, the dog is nothing but a darn bother to me. A bother to you? Shep? What ails you Shep? Go on. Now, you go on, you go on. Now, you get away. Now, go on, get away! What, I'm saying is washing up to with all is this. How about taking her off my hands? Will you do it, Tommy? Will you? You're a liar, Jonathan. I can't take Shep from you. She's your dog. Nobody else's till she dies. Thanks, anyway and look don't tell anybody I bawled. Will you, please? Honest to Christmas. We didn't do so good. Alright, it's Christmas.. ...and givin' is part of Christmas. 'Anyway, you are a bother to me.' Oh, be quiet. And don't look at me that way! [church bell tolling] Hey, ma! Wake up, it's Christmas. Oh, gee, that Jonathan. - Merry Christmas, Tommy. - Merry Christmas, ma. - Look! - Yes, dear, I know. "Dear, Tommy, I put it up to Shep "She agreed with me. She's yours. Merry Christmas. From, Jonathan." Where is Jonathan? - He's gone. - Gone? Is it alright, ma? Can I really keep her? That's what he wanted, Tommy. 'I'm sure it's alright.' [melancholic music] [music continues] [thunder rumbling] [Shep barking] [whining] [Tommy] 'Shep. Oh, Shep.' Shep. What's the matter with you, Shep? Ma. Ma, something's wrong with Shep. [Tommy] 'What's wrong with him, Mr. Bald Eagle What's wrong?' [speaking in foreign language] He say, dog Shep not eat because she want to go home. To Jonathan? [speaking in foreign language] He say, dog starve till die, if not go Jonathan. Thanks, Mr. Bald Eagle Thanks. - Goodbye, Red Wing - [speaking foreign language] Ma, we've got to get her to Jonathan. Please, say, I can take. Please, ma. Well, I don't know, dear. - How could you ever find him? - Shep could. She knows where the claim is. But you still couldn't go alone. I'll take him, Martha. I'd be glad to. Gee, thanks, Mr. Taylor. Did you hear that, Shep? We're gonna take you back to Jonathan. Now, you've got to eat and get strong for the trip. Here. Take some. You've got to. Thanks, Lin. Ma, look! She's eating. She's gonna be alright. [Shep barking] Shep, what is it? Jonathan. - Jonathan? - 'Here, Tommy.' [Tommy] 'Jonathan, what's wrong?' [Jonathan] 'Fever.' Hit me a week ago. The worst is past. So weak, I couldn't get food any longer. That's what was wrong with Shep. She knew. She wouldn't eat. She made us bring her here. Ma was right, Jonathan. Shep's your dog. Nobody else's. So, I'm giving her back to you right now. Never mind the dog, Tommy. Tommy, you rustle up some wood, I'll see about the food. I'm alright, girl and thanks. Taylor, guess you wonder how our partnerships been going. You were right. I had been a fool to file that claim. They ain't petered out in a week. So, I just kept looking upstream. Surface stuff.. Hardly worth a man's time. I'll show you. Tommy, go on over there by the shelve. 'Now, slide that chest out.' 'Forward underneath and lift up.' 'Take 'em out.' Look inside, Tommy. How much is it here, Jonathan? Oh, not much. Only around about six thousand. Six thousand dollars? [Jonathan] 'And plenty of more to come.' Six thousand? That's just from gravel? Still haven't found the main vein? No, but it's up there. I aimed to just work up stream until I find it. And I will as sure as your name is Lin Taylor. Jonathan, do you realize what this means? Means we're rich. All of us. Sure we are but that's not what I'm talking about. You need help. I'm starting back to town tomorrow. I'll take this gold and deposit it in all our names. Be safe and I'll be back. With proper equipment, we can take that gold out ten times as fast. All my life I've waited for something like this. 'And I'm not taking any chance on losing it now.' [water gushing] We'll run the inlet channel across there and build a sluice box below the rapid. [Jonathan] 'Let her go, Tommy.' Well, you see, one day's take from this baby, Taylor. Just wait. [mellow music] [music continues] [barking] [music continues] [dramatic music] How can you lie there? I tell you I heard somebody. Somebody's out there. [Jonathan] 'Sure. The same fellas you've been hearin' for three days.' You said there're other prospectors over in Oak valley. What if they've got word somehow that we've hit it? Sure. A little bird flew down and told them. So, they came running right back here so as to they could dig up all our pretty gold.. ...right in the driving rain. You may think it's funny but I don't. We'll keep a guard here while we're up at the mine. We've got to! Alright, Taylor. Then you stand guard. Tommy and me will work the mine. Or maybe that would worry you too. You'd be wondering if we were losing some of it before we got here. 'Ease up, Taylor. Stop worrying.' The richest dust in creation is no blame good if you kill yourself getting it. Now, go on and get some sleep. I'm going too. [intense music] [dramatic music] Go get it. Go get what you've put in that saddle bag. For days you've been watching us but you didn't fool me. I knew you were out there. You heard what I said. Move! [music continues] Go on. Go get what you've put in there. Taylor, what's going on here? You keep out of this. I know what I'm doing. Will you get or don't you? You crazy fool. I ought to lay you low. Make him show you what he put in that saddle bag. I took something from there for this house. He's lying. Look for yourself. No, Taylor, you look. But he was inside, searching around, snooping. For food. I would have prepared the table in the presence of my friends. This is Padre Pete. If you'd been longer in these hills you've never had made that mistake. Don't make it again. Come on, Pete. Let's see about that supper. Are you a regular person, Mr. Pete? Regular? No, son. Reckon I'm as irregular as it comes. Got to have roots to be a regular person. Me? I ain't got the roots of a tumbleweed. Two things I love above all else. The Lord's mountains and the Lord's sentence. So, I spent my time in one looking for the other. And I sure find.. [snapping finger] 'Here, lady.' You better leave Shep alone. She never makes up to strangers. She don't? Here. Here, lady. Here, lady. Well, you got it wrong, brother Taylor. "Thou sawest the beast that was and is not." Revelation 17:8. 'What a plenty of love in this dog for them that loves her' 'ain't there, Shep?' Or maybe she just likes my stew. [all laughing] Pete, this is from all of us. Well, in his name I thank you, Jonathan.. ..Tommy, Mr. Taylor and you too, lady fair. The Lord be with you in all your labors. Lay not up for yourself treasures on earth but lay out for yourselves treasures in heaven. Matthew 6. Giddy up, Gabriel. - Goodbye, Mr. Pete. - Goodbye, Pete. Goodbye. ♪ Work for the night is coming ♪ ♪ Work through the morning hours ♪ ♪ Work while the dew is falling♪♪♪♪♪ Tommy, you go down to work. I'll be along. Well, you gave him dust. That's a dirt give away. We struck pay dust. - If the old fool talks-- - He won't. Pete knows the law of these hills too. He lives by it. You could try doing the same. Until you do, I'm taking that gun. I keep my own gun. You're edgy, Taylor. Getting worse every time more gold goes under that floor. It ain't being scared someone would steal it, neither? It's having to split it with Martha and me. You're crazy. Only a quarter, you keep thinking to yourself. I only get a quarter and Jonathan gets half. That keeps eating at you, Taylor. I've been watching you and I know. That's why I'm taking that gun. No, you won't do that. There's two reasons why you won't shoot me, Taylor. The first, you won't find that vein without me. And the other, the other is just a hunch.. ...that you haven't got the guts. [dramatic music] [intense music] [music continues] [Shep growling] [growling continues] [music continues] Good girl. [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] Tommy, I want you to take this to your mom. Tell her I said for her to file it, right away. It's a description of the claim. Made up all our names, hers, Taylor's and mine. Is there anything wrong, Jonathan? Oh, this is just in case someone gets the bright idea of filing only in their own name. Oh! Mr. Taylor. Remember, whatever happens, not a word to anyone about my doubt. Even your mom. Promise? Now, come on. High tail it. Hurry up. - Tell your mom not to worry. - I will. Bye, Jonathan. Shep? Where are you? Shep, what is this? What ails you? You're know between us, we gotta take care of that boy. He don't know these trails like we do. Oh, it ain't for good this time. You're comin' back. Now, go on, get him. [barking] [Taylor] 'Jonathan!' Jonathan, where are they going? I sent Tommy home. The kid's getting lonesome for his ma. What's all the excitement? That thing we've been looking for. What would it look like? - Well, uh-- - No, I'll tell you. A sheer face off the cliff. White cords, the whitest you ever saw. And in it, jagged like lightening, a vein of pure gold. Gold, Jonathan. That white. It's up there, so help me. I found it, it's waiting for us. - Where? - At the head of the canyon. Well, let's go. [barking] [pleasant music] [dramatic music] [barking continues] [music continues] Alright, Shep, go on back. 'Off girl, go to Jonathan.' [barking] [music continues] You were sure right about the mountain goat. Yeah. [water gushing] Go ahead. [barking] [music continues] [intense music] It's the ledge just beyond. Let's go. [music continues] [intense music] Well, where is it? It's-it's down over the ledge. [screaming] [Jonathan] 'Taylor, help me.' Taylor, for God sake you can't. Help me. I haven't the guts. Remember, Jonathan? Shep! Shep! [Jonathan] 'Shep!' [intense music] [Lin] 'Hello, Shep.' Here, Shep, come here. What's the matter with you? [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] Hello, Shep. Where have you been whole day? Looking for Jonathan? I'm afraid he won't be back, Shep. That doesn't mean you and I can't be friends. How about it? Better be my way, Shep. I rather not have anything happen to you. Might make things harder for me to explain. [dramatic music] [music continues] [Shep howling] Shep? Get away from there. Get away I tell you. I said get away from there. [growling] Yeah, well, you'll get what he got. [growling] [Shep barking] [screaming] [intense music] [Shep whining] Hungry huh? [whining] I figured, that'll bring you around. And I got something all ready for ya. [intense music] Not hungry enough yet, huh? You will be. [dramatic music] This what you want? [Shep barks] So, that's the way it is huh? Here. More? Now, get out of here. Get out. Remember you asked for it. [music continues] [whining] [whining] [whining continues] [Shep barking] [mellow music] [whining] [whining continues] Ha! [dog barking] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [music continues] [male #1] 'Bald Eagle in town. Find quick. Maybe, he save dog.' Ha! Hiya! [intense music] [dog barking] 'Hiya! Hiya!' [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [dramatic music] [speaking in foreign language] Please, Mr. Bald Eagle, isn't there anything else you can do? [whinning] [music continues] Shep, Shep girl. Gee, Mr. Bald Eagle, you're wonderful. Thanks! [speaking in foreign language] [female#1] 'We take her your house. She's doing well.' [Tommy] 'Don't you worry, Shep.' 'I'm gonna find out about that poison.' Nothings gonna stop me till I do. [thunder rumbling] [dreaming] These hills ain't bad? But always remember, one good storm could start a slide that would cover the gold forever. [thunder rumbling] [intense music] [Tommy] 'Shep! Come here.' 'Where're you going?' [music continues] [Shep howling] Shep! [whistling] [Shep barking] - Jonathan. - Tommy, what're you doing here? Where's Jonathan? He's gone. He's been gone for three days. - Where? - I don't know. Over towards Blue Mountain somewhere he thought he might pick us up a deer for meat through the winter. - But I heard his whistle. - You couldn't have. Shep must have too. She was barking. When did you see Shep? The Indian kids found her. She was almost dead. - From poison. - She's alright now? I knew Jonathan would wanna know so I brought her back. Mr. Taylor, are you sure he's not here? 'I know I heard.' I told you, Tommy, he's not here. Shep. Shep. Shep, here, Shep. Why don't she come here. I know she's out there. Don't worry about her, Tommy. You're tired and upset. A goodnights sleep and you start home in the morning. Sit down and rest. I'll fix you some supper. I'd better unsaddle my horse, Mr. Taylor. - I'll be right back. - 'Alright.' [dramatic music] [whinning] Shep, what is it? What is it, Shep? [whinning] Jonathan. [Shep barking] Shep, be quiet. Shh! [Shep barking] It is. It's Jonathan's. [Lin] 'Tommy.' 'Tommy.' [intense music] Tommy. Tommy, you out here? [twig snaps] Tommy. Tommy, is that you? No, no, let me go. Let me go. Where'd you get it? Shep found it. It's Jonathan's. You lied, he isn't away. He's dead. You killed him. He's buried over there and you killed him. Shut up, you here me. No, I won't you killed him and I'll tell everybody. You're wrong, Tommy. You're not gonna tell anybody that. - Shep, help. - Shut up. - 'Help, Shep.' - 'I said, shut up.' [growling] [intense music] Tommy. Come on, Apache. Jump it. 'Please, Apache. You've got to jump.' You've got to boy. You've got to. Tommy, come back here. Come back. [music continues] You little fool.. [music continues] [mellow music] Tommy. Come on, now. Drink it. You're alright now. Here. Drink, Tommy. Drink it. That's right. That's fine boy. [music continues] Get away from me. Leave me alone. Listen son. You've got to listen to me. There's nothing to be afraid of. You're here perfectly safe and I brought you here. Now listen. You've been scared, Tommy. I know that. And it's my fault. But that's, that's because I was scared too. So scared that I-I almost lost my head. A man can be scared too, Tommy. Even of a kid like you. Especially if that kid get's a wrong idea in his head. And you've got the wrong idea son. You lied. - You said he was hunting. - Yes. Yes I lied. You know why? Because I knew you loved Jonathan, Tommy. Almost as much as your own father. So I, well, I didn't know how to tell you just like that. Jonathan is dead, son. He was working up in the canyon and he fell. Was an accident. Two days ago I found his body, well, I buried it where you saw. I was coming in tomorrow to tell your mom. Shep. Where is Shep? Shep's alright, I saw her outside a while ago. Shep was like you son. She got the wrong idea too. So, let's both of us forget about what happened tonight. Shall we? I, I guess so. Sure we will. Now, you get some sleep and you'll be fine in the morning. [dramatic music] 'Just sleep son and forget the whole thing.' [birds chirping] [Pete] 'Oh, Jonathan.' 'Hello!' 'Hello, there!' Tommy, wake up. you've got company son. And don't forget what we talked about last night. About the accident to Jonathan. Better let me do all the explaining. - Alright? - 'Hey, Jonathan.' Hi, Mr. Taylor. Uh, Mel Styner and Carl Crain. This runaway come in to their camp last night. I thought, I remembered he was yours. They were breaking camp for winter anyway so on the way into to town figured we cut across the ridge and fetch 'em back. Why, hello, there, Tommy boy. Hi, Mr. Pete, Gee I'm sure glad to see you. We both are Pete, mighty glad. And thanks for bringing the horse back. Sure, where's Jonathan? It's a good thing you men came along. Come inside I'm afraid I got some bad news for you. [Pete] 'And in thy heavenly kingdom Lord.' 'Let him find peace.' 'That peace which passes understanding.' 'Let the gold he sort on earth be his in heaven.' 'The pure and shining gold of thy holy grace.' We ask it Lord in his name. Amen! [mellow music] Come along, Tommy. Come on, Shep. Thanks, Pete. And I'll count on you to explain everything in town. That I will. As long as you can take Tommy and the dog back for me I'll probably stay on up here till spring. 'For ever one's sake I'd like to prove Jonathan was right.' 'You see he was sure there was real pay dirt here.' 'So far we've never found it.' 'Pete, do all you can to help Tommy will you?' 'You know kids some times imagine all sorts of things' 'and Jonathan's accident hit the boy pretty hard.' 'I'm sure you understand.' [Pete] 'I do indeed, Mr. Taylor.' Pete, he's lying don't believe him, please don't believe him. It wasn't an accident. Jonathan didn't fall. He killed him. I know he did. He's lying. He's lying about everything. Tommy. The boys hysterical. He hated Jonathan and he killed him. Last night when I found out he tried to kill me too. - He's lying, Pete. - Tommy, listen to me. You say I wanted to kill you? Where did you sleep last night? Who picked you up on your horse and carried you to the cabin? Why, Tommy, you slept six feet from me the whole night through. Safe and well. Does that sound like I wanted to hurt you, answer me? Pete, don't believe him, he did do it. Shep knows too that's why he tried to poison her. You don't believe me. He said the claim didn't pay out. But it did. There's bags full of gold in that cabin. A dozen of 'em. If that's true, guess you can show us son. I will. Come on. There was more. A lot more. 'He's done something with the rest.' You better take these back to Martha. I was holding this hoping to have a bigger haul by spring. There is more now. A lot more. Mr. Crain, can't you see he's lying. Mr. Styner, don't believe him. Please, don't believe him. Guess, we'd better be going. Please, Mr. Pete. Come along, son. [dramatic music] 'Come on, Shep.' [intense music] Lady, come on. Come on. [dramatic music] Lady, come on. [grunting] [Tommy] 'Shep, Come back. Shep!' [dramatic music] [snoring] [barking] [dramatic music] [gunshot] [barking] [gunshot] [water flowing] [dramatic music] [gunshot] [gunshots] [barking] [gunshots] [dramatic music] [intense dramatic music] [growling] [growling continues] [intense dramatic music] [barking] [panting] [dramatic music] [growling] No. No, Shep. I surrender. No. I didn't do it. No, Shep. Don't do it. Don't do it, please. I didn't mean to. I swear. Please, Shep. Please. 'Please.' God! Good God! I didn't mean it. [screaming] [dramatic music] Shep! Here, Shep. She's lost, Pete. - We'll never find her. - We'll keep tryin', son. [wind whistling] [dramatic music] Shep. What's wrong? It's alright, Shep. I'm sure it is. [whimpering] Oh, Shep. Hey, Shep. [instrumental music]
