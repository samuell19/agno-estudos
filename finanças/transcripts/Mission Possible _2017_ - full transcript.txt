Thank you. Oh, we just got the new coat collection and I can show you afterwards. A coat for dogs? That sounds adorable, doesn't it? How much does that cost? Oh, not much. Considering it's from a local designer, it's about 50. 50 bucks? Mm-hm. Yeah, I can't afford that. You don't know how many dogs I have. Just dry the pooch and I'll be back in 10. Okay. Thank you. Aw. Hey, Sis, how's it going? You know me. Work, work, work. Harry! These look really good. This looks like the cereal I eat for breakfast. It tastes like the cereal I eat for breakfast. Of course the fleabag would love this. This is the expensive stuff. Let's just get these like we always do. All right, all right. Five kilograms in a bag. Let me do the math. If we divide that. I think we're gonna need a bag. Ow, god! Don't be stupid! And stop using the metric system, will ya? What are we gonna do with one bag? Uh, well... Hey, with all the mouths we gotta feed and at least twice as many coming in in the next week, we're gonna need at least five bags. All right, well, they've got. They only got one bag. Don't you dare hit me! Well then zip it and let me do the talking, all right? All right. Excuse me. Excuse me? Can you please help at the register? There's some guys over there, and I think they are breeders. So it could lead to good business. So. I have to be in class in a few minutes but... Can we get some help over here? Okay, okay, sure. Oh. Hey, gentlemen. How can I help you? Yeah, I was wondering if you have any more bags of this? Of course we do. How many would you like? Ah, need at least four more. Oh, that's a lotta munchies. You gentlemen must be dog breeders? We are, yeah. No. - No. - No, we are not dog breeders. Nope. Oh. We're just trying to stock up for the summer so we don't have to keep coming back here. - Stocking up. - Okay. Okay, well, you know... Stop repeating after me. Sorry, sorry. If you have a lot of puppies, then you might need a good vet. So, why don't I give you my card? Great. A lot of pups, man. That's an understatement. We got a ton of, oh, my god! You'll have to forgive my friend. He gets a little ahead of himself. Stop it. That's what you get every single time. Every single time. I'm gonna kill you. - Stay there, doctor. - Gentlemen, please! I'll kill you. No fighting in the pet store. You, Brian. I can't believe you. Sorry. I was just helping. I wasn't doing anything. It was them! I would never do anything like that. We'll fix everything. Don't worry about it. You come with me. Your dog is ready. Thank you. All right. I'm gonna go get a cappuccino. You stay here, fix everything. Pay for the dog chow, all right? Meet me in the main square later. Doctor, adieu. Okay. I bet he's gonna get a panini. Every time he says he's getting a cappuccino, he gets a panini and he doesn't get me one. All right, well. Give me that. 10 bags of puppy chow and one of these for me. This is, like, one of the coolest places. So nice. Nice. This is how we start off our vacation. With a picnic. Little picnic.

I need one more time before I die of my old age. Is it this weekend? Me too. Don't worry. Come on. What are you guys? Oh, we should be so lucky. Look what's coming our way. Beautiful. Well, miss, miss? Countessa. You are talking to the Countessa. So, you have to address her with due respect. Countessa, my apologies. May I repay the compliment and say that your beauty is mesmerizing. I know. I was talking about the dog. Oh. It's a Shih Tzu, right? Yeah, right. The dog, of course. She is a beauty, isn't she? You are a beauty, aren't you? She is the finest breed of Shih Tzu, straight from China. China? Hannah, you remember Shanghai? Oh, yes. I was so young, Hannah. Yeah, we never felt younger than in Shanghai. Take a seat. Why, thank you, Countessa. Don't mind if I do. Very kind of you. Beautiful. I like you. I want it, I need it. Mister. Harry, call me Harry. My friends call me Harry. Mr. Harry, sell me your dog. My dog? You don't want to please the Countessa? No, I mean, yes, of course. It's just, well, I've grown quite attached to this little fur ball but I would love nothing more than to please the Countessa. Perfect. Tomorrow, bring it to me. Hannah, we go. - Okay. - Tomorrow it is. Bring her where? To the Countessa's castle, of course. Countessa's castle. You hear that? You little money bag? Bill is 85. Excuse me? Of course.

Pretty sure they don't want any visitors around here as well. No, I just think they're hiding something. Maybe a hidden treasure. How could there be treasure in a place like this? Did I hear treasure? I want my share. Guys, don't listen to Arman. There's no treasure here. There is, how do you know? Yeah. What? It was Arman who brought it up and he made it up. He started it. You started it. Excuse me, Arman, why did you started on that? What is that? Kids. What was that thing? A monster? What? There's no such thing as a monster. Don't overdo it. You're one to talk. You were the first to run away. Yeah, I ran away but there's no such thing as a monster. Xander, you guys are all cowards. I would've totally gone in. Yeah, but, here you are. You didn't stay and face the creature. Yeah but, yeah but, yeah but. It was a monster. I've seen it well. There's fire in its eyes. No, you're wrong. I saw it, his eyes was ice cold. Okay, here, let's make it clear. Ice, fire, two totally different things. Whatever, one thing is for sure. We're not going back there again. Right, yeah. It's getting, it's getting dark. We should probably pack up and head home. Yes but, let's take a selfie to immortalize the monster moment. - Okay, okay guys. - Now? Everybody, let's make a monstery face, okay? Don't do anything, your face is scary enough. Oh, oh! That's funny, I'm still very terrified. Oh, it's a bit smoky. Fine, I'm not in the selfie. Arman, selfie ruined. Good. Okay, bye bye.

Go, go! Bad dog! Smell's burning my nostrils. Good boy. Ugh, some fresh air. Would you make sure he washes tomorrow? What's the point? That smell is never coming off him. It can't hurt. Oh, yes it can. When he gets wet, it gets worse. Trust me, I bathed with the guy. Yeah? Okay. My man will be there. Yeah, ciao. What ya got? Pick up the rest of the dogs tomorrow. Yes, yes, yes! You not coming? No, as much as I'd like to, I can't. Why not? I gotta go drop off the dog to the Countessa, remember? That's right, that's right. You are so clever. You get a good price. What're you talking about? This one's a gift. Harry, that's how you kill a business. It's called the Trojan Horse theory. We give her this one, move into her inner circle and sell the rest of them to her many distinguished friends. Buddy, buddy, that is why you're the brains of the operation, huh. Experience. Cheers. Zina, more pancakes. I agree. Yes. Ah, that's hard. This is delicious. You eat it. Oh, my gosh, I have reached a new level. Guys, enough of the politics. You know, if you guys hadn't have run away, I would've totally gone in that farm. Sure. Yeah, totally, Super Arman. Of course I would've. I bet the monster would've had you for lunch. Okay, but guys, seriously? A monster? I think it was probably just the ugly old janitor of the place. We ran away too fast to get a good look at him. Sorry but you wanna go back there and find out? - Crazy. - What, are you scared? Let's go to the ranch today. I'll beat you up, Arman. Not today, we have so many things to do here. - What? - What's up? Please. Oh, please, Zina. Oh, no, I promised your parents. - Zina. - Letizia, you know how your mother worries when you ride the horses. But I haven't seen Thunder in a year. I miss him. Okay, fine, we'll go. Yes. But I watch you and you do exactly as I say, okay? Great, she's gonna spoil all of the fun. Mm-hm. Let me take care of her. Arman, shh. Zina, come sit with us. Oh, no, I'm gonna let mine cooling down. It's better when it's hot. Come sit. - It's fine. - Why not? That's very nice of you to offer. Wow, you've grown up a bit since last time. Yeah. It's a compliment. - Thanks. - Thank you. What are you all staring at? - Oh, no, no, no. - Nothing. Down the hatch, love. What he said. Ah, isn't that good? Yummy. Oh, my gosh. Guys, why are you laughing? I don't understand what's so funny. What is it, Zina? Are you not eating that? Oh, my belly is hurting. We have to cancel. No. That's too far, Zina. You promised us. No, can't with you, guys. Why? You can go. Luc, you are in charge. Zina, Zina, Zina, wait, wait. What now, Letizia? Take care of Alex. He runs from the horses. Yes, sure, whatever. Thank you. Darn it, I should've taken a picture. I spit out my crepe. You know, well, with animals and mammals, I always encourage people to talk to them to get to know them or even imagine what it's like to be an animal, you know? Yeah. Of course, in your case it would obviously be the horses. Does that sound dumb? Oh, no, Dr. Brian. That's really interesting. I love when you talk. Not now, not now. We'll talk later. Do you ever feel like the, the horses are talking to you? I wish. Hey, Mario. Hi, Mario. Thank you. When are you guys getting married? Excuse me? - Hey, Dr. Brian. - Hey, Doctor. How are you doing? Hi kids, I didn't know you arrived for vacation. We came here yesterday. Yeah and we can't wait to go for a ride. Letizia, I don't see Alex. Is he okay? Yeah, perfectly fine. I just didn't bring him 'cause he barks at the horses and it's so annoying. And how are you, Erica? - It's Rebecca. - Rebecca. ♪ La la ♪ Na na nam ♪ Give me the boot ♪ Give me the boot ♪ Give me the boot ♪ Give me the boot Alex! Oh, my god! Get back here, Alex! Alex!

You both go with the donkey. - Hi. - Stop it, stop it. - You go with the donkey. - What? Zina, I told you to be careful. You better pray that I find him! What happened, Letty? That useless Zina, she opened a window and Alex escaped. - No. - Oh, no. Yes. What if I never find Alex again? Don't worry, worry warts. We'll find your boy. Yeah, and he's probably at the old farm still. That's on the other side of town. Not to mention the monster factor. I mean that's creepy stuff. What if we take the horses? - Oh, that's a good idea. - Good idea. You think we could, Claudia? I mean, it is an emergency. It is. Okay kids, so let's organize. You, follow me please. Let's go. I'm bringing that one. No, no. Oh, you gotta get better at stopping, man. That looks beautiful. Is this the place? Of course, it's the place. It's a castle, isn't it? - Come on. - You know, I swear it's hard working with you, man. Like we're operating on one brain here. I'm sorry, all right? I didn't notice that it was, yeah, I see it now. It's a castle, all right? I was expecting a moat or something? There's your moat right there. - Perfect. - Look, tip of the day.

If I could have more dogs just like this I can win. I think I can help you. Wow. I didn't get a chance to mention this before but I actually breed Shih Tzu. - Wow. - Wonderful! You can have 30 for me? 30? Mm-hm. Well, perhaps but I will need two days to prepare them. You price gonna be my price but, do quick. You'll have them in time for the show. Excellent but what are you waiting for? Just go. Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I'm terribly embarrassed, Countess but I lent my car to my partner. Is there any way I could possibly trouble you for a ride into town? Well, let's go. We'll drive together. I hope you don't have car sick. Me, car sick? Speed is in my blood. Go, go, go. Countessa, put the pedal to the metal. Oh yeah? Yeah. I never drive in my life. It's gonna be the first time. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah. Here the car say. Here you are! Oh, god, I'm here. Let me out.

Every time. Crazy canine never listens. - Where is Alex? - Wait, what? He went in before we could grab him! Oh, no, we have to do something! Oh, no. I'm going in. Yeah, right, Super Arman, calm down. That would be trespassing. I'm pretty sure I can go through where Alex went. It's just you two lads have to lift the gate up. Arman, go in, now! All right, all right. Okay, Luc. Help me out with the fence. Yes, yes, perfect. Oh, perfect. Go ahead, Arman. I'm in! Your plan worked. Oh, my gosh. Good job. All right, Arman, your job is to go and find Alex and come straight back. All right, I'll see you guys later. All right, good luck, Arman. See you guys! - All right. - Be careful. Good luck, Arman! No monsters yet. Arman, you find Alex! Okay, chill. Oh, my gosh. Wow, can't believe it. It's amazing. All these Shih Tzus. Hey, come here, come here. I won't hurt you. Where is he? It's taking him way too long. Guys, I think I better go in. You won't fit. You won't... Look, Arman's back! Oh, my gosh. Oh my gosh, guys. Look at all the Shih Tzus! Hurry up, guys, we need to hurry up. Well done, man. Yeah. Come on, let's go. I can't, I can't go. There are at least 10 dogs. I need to free more. No, you don't, it's too dangerous. Come back now, dude. Here comes Alex. Quiet! You're gonna wake the monster. I can take care of myself, don't worry. See you guys soon. Come back quick. Don't go, I'm responsible for you. Come back, no! What's happening? I got you! Arman! Now, I got you, kids! Come on quick, look behind you! Arman, Arman! Arman, what are you doing? What are you doing? What is that? - Go, go, go! - Arman, hurry up! Go, go, go, go, go. Come get me, you dirty mug! Why, just run for your life. - You're crazy. - That was so wicked. Why, why, why did you take a selfie? Yeah, exactly. Because it has to be the selfie of the year. Imagine, selfie with a stinky monster. Not a good idea. You could've gotten yourself hurt, Arman. Well, actually that's pretty tough, man. I'm gonna crush you! Kids! Oh, my gosh, that was so scary. We're all good. Let's just calm down. We're all fine, that's the main thing. Oh, my gosh, that thing was way too close. That thing is disgusting. What was that? I don't know what it was. I know it was disgusting and it sure stunk more than the dogs. I bet it eats human flesh. Arman, you said you saw some other dogs? Yeah, yeah, I saw at least 15 more dogs. It was incredible. So, Luc, what do you think? Should we go save them? No, not with that monster around. I think we should bring the new one to Dr. Brian. I'll go back and download the picture with the monster and she's do, you guys do this, right? See you. Okay, fair enough. Bye, Arman. That's the only reason why I'm sad. Great, I will see you guys tomorrow, okay? Good job. Hey! - Guys, guys, calm down. - Great to see you. We need to see Dr. Brian immediately. Okay, calm down, calm down, calm down. You guys, calm down, okay? Remember you're in the veterinary department of University of Camerino. I'm gonna see if Dr. Brian can see you guys, okay? - Great. - Great. But, I can only take three of you. And then you know the other two will have to stay here. I don't want to wait here. It's okay, we'll go back home and join Arman. Okay, okay, let's go. Hey, how 'bout a sandwich or a taco salad? Just not when I'm working. Your little voice's stressing me, okay? Have a carrot. I put four carrots there. Hello, Lillian. You are beautiful. Hey. Do you have five minutes? Always, what's up? Okay, well, Luc and Coco, they found a dog. And I don't have any idea what they're saying. You're in Italy, aren't you? No! Don't go anywhere. Get back to the farm right away. What are you doing? Nope, nope, I just saw the perfect Shih Tzu. No, I just saw the perfect Shih Tzu. With these two girls. Just like old times, it'll be a piece of cake. All right, just get back to the farm, all right? I'll see you there. Cheeseburger to go. A cheeseburger? Yeah. We don't make... I want a cheeseburger! Come on, come on, come on, come on. Bye! I'm sorry, guys but it's hard to believe all these dogs and a monster? But we have proof. Arman took a photo of the monster on his phone. Guys, we have to do something about all the poor Shih Tzus being held prisoner. Okay, we don't know that that's true yet. We saw them. Oh, I wonder if it has anything to do with the breeders that we met. It really didn't look like a legitimate breeding kennel. Where's this terrible place? Well, it's in the middle of that forest. It's a bit scary. It's very sketchy. Yeah. Why don't you guys meet us tomorrow at the edge of the forest, three o'clock and I'll talk to this man. Wait, talk to the monster? Are you crazy? No, I don't believe in monsters. Talk to the monster. We saw it. I'm gonna go with you. I don't want you to go alone. Okay, good, good. I'm so hot. - I know, right? - It's really nice here. Look at the view. I know, it's boiling in here. Yeah, I wonder what Luc, Xander and Coco are doing. I just can't believe like... I think they're probably swimming. It's super hot, they should. No, they're not swimming. They're in the doctor's office. Howdy, girls. How did it go? Oh, we didn't go in, I mean... Oh, no. Lillian let only three people go. - Oh really? - Arman, I'm sorry but we're gonna go in. We're too hot to talk. Yeah, yeah. See you later. My stupid phone's been playing up. I'm gonna go in as well, I'm hot. Oh, he loves me more. No, It's me. Remember who got him? Me. No, he loves me more. I chose the name, he likes my name. No, I chose the name. You wanted to call him Bobby or something, whatever. But I didn't, I chose the name. Wait, I think... He likes me more. I think you must be missing Lulu already. Ew, Alex! That's disgusting. Gross, that's disgusting! Ew, ugh. - Go away. - What's with you, Alex? That's disgusting. I'm not kidding. A monster and many little dogs. What kind of dogs? Alex? Alex? Oh, no, Zina! I believe they're all Shih Tzus. If we're dealing with Shih Tzus, you should investigate the local contessa. Her castle is close to your position. This could be very serious. Can you find me any maps, plans or information? I'll see what I can find. Cheers mate. Crazy YouTubers. So, what's the plan? This is the house of the expert of all Italian architecture. Those blueprints must be in there. Bingo. Well done. That's it, that's the file. Here comes the easy part. Who's my little ticket out of here to the big time? You are. You are. Aw yes. You and me, bud, we're going places. Harry! Harry! Look what I taught him. Come here, come here, come here. Come here, come here, come here. Okay, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it. Do it! D-O-G. Dogs. It's better just me and you. Oh, man. Hey, the dogs are all in the shed and I gotta tell you, it's a beautiful batch. It's a beautiful batch. Yeah, yeah but none as beautiful as this little purebred champion right here. Tomorrow, we bring this little guy and one more fur ball to the Countessa. We're just bringing two? Yeah, get the best price we can for these two and sell the rest same rate. That is why you're so clever. See, Stink, this is why he's the boss. Do you hear that? Go ahead baby, go ahead. - Boss. - Boss. - Boss. - Put on something nice, will ya? I wanna make a good impression. Come on, bro. I always look sweet. Proud of you, Frank. Thanks. But you, Stinky. Kid comes to spy on us, you're too stupid to chase him away, huh? Sorry. What happened? He fast, so fast. And hurt me. Oh, he was fast, he hurt you? Okay, okay, relax, relax. What are you, useless? Come here, come here. Take this dog, and go sleep with the rest of the dogs where you belong! No, no! Yeah and you better keep a good watch tomorrow or I'll sell you, too, all right? Now, get out of here, huh! Go on, get out of here! Stink, Stink, go with the dogs. It's okay, go, go, go, go, go. Why are you so nasty, huh? You tryin' to win the jerk of the year award? I don't wanna have to move out of this place 'cause of that idiot, all right? Just chill. Frank, you see this? That's pretty, what is that? Oh! You think that's funny, huh? Yeah. You think that's funny, huh? - I do. - Slappin' me all the time. You think that's really funny, huh? Pow! You looked! Get ready to feel the thunder. One, two, three, four, five. You didn't wipe it off. Slap me. My stomach, it's going to my stomach. Yeah, how long have you been a cop? I mean a police officer. No, no, no, cop is fine. I'm from Brooklyn, you know? - Right. - I've always been a cop. I mean I was a cop before I was a cop. Actually, before I was a cop, I met a lot of cops. 'Cause I was a crook, Brian. You know just a few little things, served a little time. Things like breaking and entering, packing a piece. Yeah. Little things like that. Really? Wow, that's, that's really interesting. Hey, you not to be so animal centric but you ever work with a lot of police dogs? Sniffers? Oh, yeah, sniffers, my first partner was a sniffer. Yeah? No, he was a German Shepherd named Ralphie. He could sniff out a convict with one sniff. Yeah? And tell you if it was him or not. Wow. He introduced me to my first wife, Loretta. Oh yeah, he sniffed her out. I think he was the reason we got divorced but what a dog. Brian, Brian. The bunny's ready in the scan room. Let's go. Yeah, I gotta get back to work. We'll talk more later, okay? Yeah. See ya. Yeah, there we go. Ralphie. What a dog. Yeah. Whoa! How are you today? Hi, excuse me, I just wanted to see if you were coming to the meeting tonight. The security meeting. Maybe. I don't know. Bring your sister if she wants to come, okay? Well, I kind of have to work right now, you know. Is that a goat? What's his problem? That's a bunny. It's not a goat. That was funny, though. You're funny. - Funny. - Okay. Very funny. I just wanna say this university is the cutting edge university for technology in the world. And we have to work right now so, if you could just please, unless you wanna be scanned as well, we can... No. Scan you too? No, that's okay. Okay, thank you, thank you, thanks. Guys, listen up. Due to the recent events, like the disappearance of Alex again, I think it's safe to say it's time to take actions. Guys, make sure to listen so you don't get hurt. All right, Xander, I've prepared this gun for you, all right? First, we need to test it. Good job. You see? Yeah. It's pretty dangerous, man. You don't mess with Papa Arman. Girls, I've prepared this weapon. It might be a bit primitive but it sure works. Xander... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. There's Luc here. I'm good. He's perfectly testable. You know, oh! Aw! - Yeah, I like it. - I could have that. I have a question. What are these bottles for? That's pee, I filled them up overnight. - What? - Ew, that's gross. It's a lethal weapon. Arman, that's revolting. What do you even mean? Whose pee is this? It's mine, do you want me to spray you with it? What is this? Look, Arman, what is this? Arman, what is this? It's pee. Please take a step forward. No, no, no, no, you have lost it! You have lost it. I have lost it, I'm mad! This guy's crazy. Come on, guys! You gotta act cool when you come to a castle like this, man. You gotta be cooler man. You're all stiff and, come on. What are you doing? I'm just nudging ya for, aw! What did you do that for? Hey, gentlemen. Hi, Lily. You guys know the way now, right? Hello, madame. Of course. Thank you. Thank you for letting us in thy castle. I can't believe you wore those shoes. Well, maybe you should just relax about the shoes and think about your jacket and your scarf. So 1997. But naturally better than those... I love your castle. Thank you. It's not yet mine. Not yet. Where are they? Of course. Your gentlemen are so funny guys. Yeah. I'm Frank. I used to be a male model. Brought you these roses. If only they were half as beautiful as you are. Lily, put them to the fire this, to the fire. They are my dog? Aw! Your majesty. Count Countessa, these are two of the most precious Shih Tzus that have ever walked on. Did you want me to say? Four legs. Can I hug him? Of course. These are two of our stars from the last litter. Say hi to your new mommy. So cute. Sure, you can touch this one. - Yeah. - You can touch me later if you want. Oh, this is for you. What do you think? Take him, take him. Lily, Lily, help me. Take it, take it, take it, take it. Where are the rest? I ask about 30 dogs. Don't worry. Our assistant is prepping them right now as we speak. Yeah. Countessa, I have checked these dogs out, each one of them nose to tail and I gotta tell you, they are immaculate. We'll have them ready for tomorrow. Yeah. Okay, that's, okay, tomorrow. Now, there's just a little matter of cost. Yeah, sister, look, you gotta pay up. We got all kinds of expenses. We got kibble, aw! Again with the foot. What my partner meant to say was that it costs so much to raise these little fur balls and create them into winners. My, my, my, my, my, you Americans are so dollars. Why, thank you. Okay, tomorrow I can go in my bank. Yes, I can take money to pay after. - That would be perfect. - When I get my dogs. Hannah, bring more champagne. We're gonna drink again. Come, come darling. Let's celebrate. Yes, Hannah, more champagne. Hannah, more. Nobody ever likes my jokes. Not true, I love it. I love it, I love it, I love it. I knew it was you the whole time. There it is. See, Arman found the Shih Tzus in that shed on the left. Yeah and guys, today I brought snippers so we can all go in. Good thinking, Arman. All right but first I wanna see if anyone's here. Hello? Hey, men, where are you? Show your self! Come meet us! Quiet, quiet! I don't think nobody's here, guys. You're right, sis. Let's go in. Let's get my Alex. Brian, if you cut it just there, we'll be able to get in. Okay, let's see... And guys, this is where I found Lulu. Oh, okay. Good job.

What is it? What is it? Oh, my god. I'm gonna go, guys. They're so cute. Oh my god! - So many dogs! - You see? Guys, you see I wasn't lying. Arman, take some pictures. I'm on it. Arman, he said pictures not selfies. The police don't need to see your face. Okay, okay. It stinks. Uh-oh, I know that smell. Gonna get dog! Run! Dog stink. No, Stink the dog! Don't move, don't move! I don't want to hurt you! Oh, my god! Did we outrun it? I think we did. Good, good, is everybody here? Yeah, we're all here. Wait. What about Lillian? Guys, we have to go back. But we can't fight the monster. I'm serious. We should call the police. Well, guys, the Wi-Fi's terrible and there's absolutely no internet connection. Everybody follow me. Let's go get Captain Ted, come on, come on. Good idea. Come on. Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh. Captain Ted. - Good lord, Ted. - They're here. Ted, we saw a monster. I was there. I was the one who went. Quiet. Quiet, I said, quiet! We saw a monster. If you're all talking at the same time, I can't hear anything. Brian, could you tell me what happened? - Yes, yes. - What's going on? I can definitely tell you what's going on. There are all these dogs, many dogs, Shih Tzus and there are definitely, definitely, back me up, there's a crazy, scary terrible monster, right? Am I right? Poor Lillian! Poor Lillian? She was so brave. And, then there's the gun and then, of course, the rabbit. The rabbit's talking to me and I keep hearing the rabbit. The rabbit is talking to me every day and I've... Wait a minute, I don't get it, I don't get it. I don't get this part about monsters and talking rabbits. I'll explain, you numskull. My dog Alex is missing and so is Lillian. Well, does anybody know what's really happening? Let me go! No speak. You're going to jail. No speak. No speak. Let me go! No speak! No good speak!

Stinky, take the girl and the dogs and put them in the car. I got a little something special prepared for 'em. I used to love these when I was a kid. Would you knock it off? What, it's nothing. Well, that's not water. That's not water! That's not water! Oh, Frank! Frank! You peed on me. Keep everything under control, all right? I'll be right back. You got it. Six, seven, eight.

Ah, Mr. Harry, I didn't expect to see you so soon. This room is enchanting. What do you call it? I call it museum of my life. Just wow. And the countess intends to open this part of the castle to visitors. You know Airbnb? Oh, yes. And the income we have for the runway shows. To buy the dogs. Of course. Well, tell me. Do you have my Shih Tzu? Well, not exactly. I don't understand. You have them? Yes or no? In truth, I came to ask for your help. How can I help you? After our meeting, I went back to my totally legit dog breeding kennel and it was burning, ensconced... Oh no! - The dogs. - No, the dogs. Don't worry, don't worry. The Shih Tzus are fine. I managed to save them with Frank's help. Thanks god for that. But, but, we need a place for the night and I remember you mentioning that you had a room you keep for the dogs? Yes, of course. Hannah. Yeah? Do give him the key for the dungeon. Okay. Now could you excuse me? I have some work to do. Of course. With this small little puppet. Just keep going, just work again. - Just work. - Thank you, Countessa. Just work, just work more. Follow me, I'll give you the key. You can use the back entrance. It will be more discreet. Discretion is good. And work and just work and just uh. I'm sorry, I forgot one thing. Yes? Don't go upstairs under any circumstances. We would never. I had to get involved with dogs! Shih Tzus! I should have gone to medical school. Frank! Get in the bus! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, let's go, come on! All right! Screw you if you don't start right now. You will bite. You know, I could've been a dentist. I like teeth, I really do. What are you talking about? Nothing, it's something. All right, settle down, settle down, here we go.

Captain, this is the farm of horror. All right, you kids stay behind me and be quiet. Okay? Captain Ted, it's over here, this way. After you, sir. I don't think this is a good idea. Hey, Captain Ted, it's this way. Captain, the dogs are in that shed over there. Yeah, over there. Okay. All right, listen. I want you all, all you kids to stay here and just be quiet. Okay? Don't move. And Brian, you come behind me. You open the door quietly. Just... I'll stay here, okay. I should, no, I. Go, go, go. I don't think I should do this part, okay? Come on, you can do it. No, I don't... The kids are looking! I am a veterinarian, okay? I don't do this. Never mind. All right, everybody down. Hit the floor. There's no dogs in there. There's no monster, I assure you there were dogs, I saw them with my own eyes. I believe you, kinda. I mean, there definitely was dogs in there - if you know what I mean. - There was 2,000 dogs in there. Phew, they must've picked up the whole operation and gone somewhere else. What do we do now? Yeah. I bet that house has some clues. Follow me. Good idea, Captain. Come on, let's go. Shh, quiet now. There's nobody here. I can't see! Oh, jeez, Captain, are you okay? What happened? What happened to you? Getting old? Are you okay? Oh, my god. Hey, don't get anywhere close to me! Whoa, whoa! You are the monster. Ooh, I know I'm on a diet but these croissants look really good.

Good. Hey, this place ain't bad, huh? It's a little small but it's not so bad. Yeah, well, I don't plan on staying here long. Soon as I close this deal with the Countessa, we're out. France, here we come. We're going back to France? We're going back to France. We're going back to France? Yup. France? Stinky, we're going to France! Ah, Stinky you're gonna love the bread. It's called a baguette. Ah, it the ingredients alone are fantastic. Oh, they don't put any pesticides. No pesticides in their food. See, now in America, we put a lot of pesticides in food which is what I've eaten my whole life. Will you shut up? All right. Stinky, take off her gag. Let's see what she has to say. You better not scream. Please give me water. Yeah, all right. Stinky, go get her some water. I hope you know that kidnapping is a serious crime. I did not know that. Thank you. Not to mention dog napping. Would you shut her up? Harry. Please, let me go upstairs. I mean, what does she think we're gonna steal her furniture? Hey! What did I say? Do not go upstairs under any circumstances. Just stay here and try not to let your imagination run away from you, all right? All right. I'm gonna go bring this gift to the Countessa to thank her for her kindness. Watch over her and don't let her get in any more trouble, all right? All right, all right. Stinky, don't let him go upstairs and, you, shut up! Hey, hey, hey. Tell Hannah I said hey. Or I mean like you know if it seems like a good time to do something like that, just like slip it in there that I said hey. Shut up! Or don't. That's cool too. There must be so many rubies and jewels and crowns up there but Harry said not to go. Not gonna go but if I just go and I just, just, just I'm just gonna check it out. Ah, Jesus! Okay, okay, stop sneaking up on me like that! Boss said not go upstairs. Okay, okay, okay. I'm just gonna go up there. If you don't say anything, he won't know, capiche? Now you go over there and you pretend it's a drive-in and you cuddle with your girlfriend. All right? Yeah. You go over there. Frank's going up here. I'm just gonna take a little peek. Aw, yeah.

No, no, no, not security! - Security! - Don't call security, relax! Oh, my god! Stop, let me out, no! Mm, mm, I don't think I can eat another bite. You look stunning. I know. And thank you for the wonderful dinner, dear Countessa. Oh, no, thank you for my lovely Hannah. Aw, it was nothing, Countessa. Harry. Yes? Thank you for my lovely doggy but when are gonna have the rest of them? Oh, soon. My assistants are almost finished making the final preparations right now. Tomorrow, we're gonna go in pet shop to buy some new clothes for my doggy. I know just the place. I'll take you there tomorrow. Perfect, perfect. Shall we drink to that? Drink for this, yes! Yes, tomorrow. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. There's a horrible ghost up there! And whatever you do, don't go up there! He's bad! What is it? What's wrong with my hair? My hair, it's kinda. I look like my dad. Thanks. I'm so sad. Why Letizia? It's such a beautiful day. You're having fun in the pool and Alex is bound to turn up. It's not about Alex, it's about Lillian. I just can't stop thinking about Alex. And the other dogs. I mean the poor little things, mistreated and held prisoner. But what about Lillian? Where did the monster take her? There's bound to be something we can do. Thanks, Nanny. Why don't you guys go in town and look for them. Oh, yeah. - That's a great idea. - Good idea. Hey, maybe we can make copies of this and stick them around town. Yeah. Did you draw that? Yeah. - Oh, my god. - It's amazing. Looks exactly like Alex. That's a great idea. Let's do it. Thank you, Nanny. Thank you so much, Nanny Zina. You know what? Let me kiss you. Oh, no Coco, I don't wanna get wet. I insist. Just one little kiss, come. Come on. One little kiss. Come on here, trust me. Come on, guys! Leave him alone, Doctor. I said now. Where are you, you little rat? It's not a rat, it's a rabbit. Thanks, I know it's a rabbit, okay? I was trying to insult him. I'm not coming out, no way. I don't wanna take a bath. Don't come out. - Bath's not fun. - Please, if you don't come out now, it's gonna get nasty. Brian, who are you talking to? Are you okay? The rabbit, he doesn't wanna take a bath. I don't wanna take a bath, I don't wanna take a bath. I think you might be under a little stress since your sister's disappeared, Brian. I think you need to take a day off. Brian's going nuts, what? See, even the parrot's insulting me. You know, we used to be friends. Brian, I know parrots can talk but I didn't hear yours say anything. Forget all that. Have you got any leads on my sister? Listen. I've got my men spread out everywhere. We've got some reinforcements coming in this afternoon. You don't have to worry about anything. Thanks, Captain Ted. Don't worry. Okay. Thanks a lot. Come and get me, you long haired hippie. - Brian's gone mad. - Come here you little... Jesus! I don't like that. I don't think, too much. No, no, no, no. - No, no, no, no. - No, different color, different color. No, no, that's fine. Yellow with the hood? Oh look. Look how that cute that is with the bunny on the back? Who doesn't love the bunny? It's nice. It's nice. That's okay. Next, next, next. Next, you sure you don't like? Okay. Next one. Show us the next one, please. Pink one? Do you have pink one?

Heard your old boyfriend was a dancer. Oh, we'll take it. We'll take this one. We'll take two of these, please. Huh? Okay. That's hard to compete with, being with a dancer. Okay, two. It never hurts to have an extra. - Oh, I can move. - You're right. I can shake it, - shake it, shake it. - And it's only 60 each. Oh, you're right. So cheap. So beautiful. Yeah. We'll take two. Most dancers are a little - if you know what I mean. - That's okay. Perfect, perfect, just take it. A little sensitive. Nice girl. Help Stinky. I want to help but my hand hurt. He likes salami. What name girl? My name is Lillian. What's your name? Me? Everybody call Stinky. That's mean. Well, it kind of suits you but, what if we find a different name for you? Like Anthony? Anthony? Yes, Anthony. Anthony. I just want this one immediately. Don't say anything, I want this. Beautiful, beautiful. Wow, look at... Perfectly nice. Perfectly, perfect, I want.

There's nothing to say. No, no, no. I love them. I have to take it. Immediately we have to take it. Add that to the collection. We'll take that with the other 37 sweaters and we'll meet you at the front. Thank you. You both are like tall drinks of water. Sorry, Harry. You guys have that... Shopping. You have that expression here? Countessa, please the keys. Let me drive. Tall drinks of water? - No, no, no. - Take the dog. I got the dog, I got the dog. It's worth a lot of money, lady. Thank you, Frank. Hey, Xander. Look at that silly bunch. Yeah. Don't wanna grow up to be like them. Wow, you are super tall. I know. Yeah. Look at that crazy old lady. She looks nasty. I'm pretty sure that's the Countessa. She lives in the castle just outside this town. Hold on a minute. Isn't that a Shih Tzu? We should maybe be going Harry. Yeah, sure looks like a Shih Tzu. The dogs can't be in the sun this long, they got no sunscreen. So what? I swear that's the one we saw yesterday. Arman, you know, pretty sure there's a lot of Shih Tzus that look alike and uh, just another Shih Tzu. No, mate. Maybe all of them look like each other but this one's the one we saw yesterday. Trust me, it is. Okay, whatever you say. Countessa. Castle. We need to go. Take me to the castle now. It's in. Nothing. Not a single dog anywhere. It's ridiculous. How about you? What do you think, Lulu? Look me in the eyes and tell me where is Lillian? - Yes, Lulu. - Where is your boyfriend Alex? Okay, we're lost. All 'cause of you. Why would you put a poster over here? Nobody's ever gonna pass through here. Can you just be positive for once? You never know who's gonna walk here, okay? You want me to be positive to you? Yes. Fine, I'll find Alex myself. - Oh, let's see. - That would definitely work better. Yeah. Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Can you stop? You're giving me a headache, stop. I'll never stop. Alex! Gosh Alex, Alex, is that you? Come here. What if we run away before they come back? We can't. Harry, Harry, kill me. Lillian, escape. Anthony like Lillian. I like you too. Anthony. Kiss Lillian. We're moving too fast. I'm sorry, Anthony. I didn't mean to hurt you. That's it. So, what do we do now? Well, I think we should go stash our bikes. I have something to check on my phone. You and your phone. Like seriously, when will you ever stop? Trust me, mate. Just give this a second. Okay. Here, give me your bike. Here you go. Okay, so. Here, look, one of my mates sent me this. Hey, old chum. I hate to say this but this will be my last transmission. Click below to download. Wish me luck, I'm going deep undercover. And don't forget LEO TV, like and subscribe. What do you think about it? Wait, that's the complete blueprint for that exact castle. Yes, yes, it is. How did he even get that? It's like... Anyways, that doesn't matter. - So weird. - Look, you see here? That looks like the rear entrance connecting to the dungeon. That must be where they hide the dogs. Yeah. I'm assuming somewhere over there. Yeah, let's go find out. Sure. Look, the castle's so big. Oh, my gosh. Lillian! - My god. - Lillian, Alex! See Xander? I was right. Guys, what are you doing? We have got no time for hugs. We better make a run before they see or hear us. Yeah, come. Oh, we gotta go this way. The dogs are in the dungeon. If they know that I escaped, they're gonna run away. - Okay. - And then we're not gonna see them again. Lillian's right. Arman, call Captain Ted and Dr. Brian, okay? But in the meantime, let's go up there and we'll stay safe away from them. The Countessa's castle. Are you sure, Arman? All right, don't move. I'll be right there. Thank you. Did you hear that? They found Lillian! They found Lillian! Good, I really miss her. What are you waiting for? Run, Brian, run like the wind! Run like a cheetah unleashed from the zoo. Go, run! What happened? - Hi. - Did you find them? What's going on? Arman found Lillian and the dogs and... Awesome! Can we come with you? Yes! Just get in the car. - Yes, let's go! - That's amazing! Thank you. Come on, let's get in. So, I'm gonna walk the dogs... You're gonna walk the dogs, yes. Go, go, go, what are you doing? Whoa. She knocked him out. She knocked him out! Stinky! Can't you do anything right? Huh? You worthless, filthy, bad dog! Harry. - Bad dog! - Harry. Harry, stop it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why are you trying to choke me, sir? Stinky? Stinky? My name is Anthony. You know I was just kidding, right? Who are you? Your host and benefactor. That's nice. Not bad. Do you have any more of that soap? Sorry? Nothing personal. Ya smell like a stud. My name is Anthony. We got that. Hi, Anthony. Go time. Okay, so, where's Arman? He called me. Called me, he said that they were here. Yeah, I think they're close by. Yes, get in! - Lillian! - Lillian! - Oh my gosh. - Oh my god, Lillian. I thought I'd lost you. I thought I'd never see you. Oh, Lillian. Okay, okay, listen. Listen, I'm gonna take my two officers inside and I want all of you to stay here, all right? Stay here. Yes, sir. Okay, okay, let's follow Captain Ted. Follow him. Wait one second, I said stay here. It's dangerous in there, especially for kids. Let's go. Where are they going? They're on the other side. Wait, which way do we go? On the other side. This way, come follow me. What's this? You can't just invade people's home for no reason. I've got a very good reason and I'm arresting both of you for the audacity of your complicity for your conspiracy for dognapping and kidnapping. Cuff 'em. What? - Wait. - Oh no. No, no, I'm innocent! I'm innocent, it's not me. It's Harry. He's a bad guy, Harry! - Harry? - Let me go. Let me go. Where's this Harry? In the dungeon with the dogs. In the dungeon? Where is this dungeon with the dogs? Lily! I can show you the way. All right, take 'em to the cars. Bubbie! Let me go. Bubbie, Bubbie! Bubbie, Bubbie! All right, where's this dungeon? It's right this way, sir. Is it dark? Kind of, yeah. I know. I'm gonna use this as a leash. Quick. - What? - Let's get outta here before she gets back here with the cops. What are we gonna do with him? What aren't we gonna do with him? Leave him with the dogs. Let him take the blame. That's why you're the boss. We'll be back in a little bit, bud. Okay, how many dogs we got? One, two, three, four, seven, eight. Open the door! Oh geez! My god, we're totally done for. Think, think! Let's go upstairs! I bet you there's a way out this way, come on. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What, why? We're not going up there, it's horrible! Do you wanna go to prison? Well, no. Well, then let's go. All right. Okay, come on. Let's just stay close, all right? Open up! Let us in! Oh, my goodness! - Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. I've never. Oh, my goodness. Lillian, who is this man? This is Anthony. Why is he dressed like the monster? Ew! That's disgusting. He's a nice guy. Where's Harry and Frank? They went upstairs looking for a way out, Lillian. Right, okay, here's what we'll do. Xander, I need you to come upstairs with me. Dr. Brian, work with everybody else to make sure that the dogs are okay and take care of this guy. He's kind of. Excuse me, Arman, we need to go upstairs. All right, you guys be careful. We will. Be extra careful. Okay, everyone let's grab these dogs. Let's get out of here. Okay? Grab, everyone grab one. Come on, let's go this way. No, no, no, no. Oh, wait, you're being such a baby. It's just spider webs. Calm down, it's just some spiders. What are you doing? Look, let's just go this way. Come on, come back. No, you don't wanna eat the fruit, trust me. Just trust me. It's not good. Would you stop micromanaging me and help me find a way out of here? All right, all right, all right. I suggest we go... This way, come on! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What's through here? Right, look. You don't wanna go in there, dude. Trust me, it's really creepy. I'm gonna say this once. There's ghosts in there. Okay, Captain Creepy. I'm gonna tell you one more time. There's no such thing as ghosts! - Yes, there is. - Now, come on! No! - Come on! - No! Come on! I told you, look! There's nothing to be afraid of, all right? I thought I told you to leave me alone! Who is that? That's Napoleon's ghost. Security! Oh, god. - Security! - Oh, god, no! This is horrible. This is what happens when you are stupid in my house. You've got them? That's good, that's very good. That's what happens. Hands up, nobody move. Who are you to give orders in my house? Please. Arrest me right now! Please! Me, me, please, me! I made him do it! I made him do it. All right. You guys are working for me now. I want you to take these dog nappers downtown and lock 'em up. Oh please, no, don't. No, no. No, no. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Hey, Captain Ted, is everything all right? What are you guys doing here? Who's that guy? I thought I told you to stay in the car. All right, go on, get outta here. All right. You go with 'em. Hi, nice to meet you. You look familiar. Haven't we met somewhere before? Perhaps we will someday meet again but right now, I want you to leave my house! Bye. See you later. So cute. Of course, they're all adorable. I'm Countessa, I have nothing to do with these people. Nothing! We'll see you better when we get down to the station. Put her in the car. Countessa! Yes? You're beautiful! I know! I think I love you! Oh, my god. Ow! Who is this guy? He's just a victim of these crazy people. Brian, are you all right? All is well, Captain Ted. Doc, what are we gonna do with all the extra dogs? Well, first I'll take a look at them and make sure they're in good health. Right. And then I thought it would be a good opportunity at the dog show to try to give them away to families that would take good care of them. - Right. - Yeah. Brian, that's a great idea. All right. That's a great idea. Yeah, that's a great idea. Go, Dr. Brian! Yeah, awesome! Aw, kids. Kids. I love you guys. Kids are happy and the dogs are happy, everybody's happy. Great job. Thanks, thanks. So, tell me, Captain Ted, what have you done with the Countessa and her accomplices? Doctor, I think that she was a nut case. I mean, she told me she was 400 years old. No, They're locked up till their trial. Oh, well, I gotta say I'm happy how this story ended. I mean, look at my sister. Well, it just looks like it's just you and me now, Doc. Yeah. Dr. Brian? Would you like to come? Captain Ted, I gotta go. I'll see ya. Hey buddy. Alex, you wanna work for me? The risk with crime! That's the risk with crime! That's the risk... No, come on, relax, okay? Hannah, you were my friend. I trust you, I trust you! How you could? How you could do this to me, the beautiful Countessa? How you can? How you can do this for me? Hey! Harry friend! Harry. What's that smell? Where is my money? No, money. No, look at me! Help me. Where are you going, Countessa? I'm still Countessa. Oh, yes you are. - I'm still Countessa. - Yes, you are. I'm still Countessa. Countessa! Wig, wig, wig, wig, wig, wig. Wig, wig, wig, wig, wig!
