For years, we've demonstrated. We demonstrated and nobody listened. We demonstrated,... ...and they implemented the Fouchet and Peyrefitti measures. Today, the university administration has joined the government... ...to repress the Nanterre militants,... ...because these militants... ...now radically bring into question the university system... ...and think its transformation is a struggle beyond the university,... ...in which the working class plays a vital role. Catherine! I'm going home. I don't like it. It's too crowded. Michel, you promised. I feel out of place. You're not out of place. Look, they're here. Come on. "As always, when workers... ...and democratic forces unite,... ...left-wing agitators... ...are at work everywhere." "They are especially active... ...among Nanterre university students." BORN IN 68 We'll love each other till death do us part "There are Maoists,... ...Revolutionary Communists,... ...including some Trotskyites,... ...the Committee of Revolutionary Students,... ...also mainly Trotskyite,... ...anarchists... ...and other more or less outlandish groups." "Despite their conflicts,... ...these few hundred students unite... ...in what they call the " March 22 Nanterre" movement,... ...led by an anarchist." German! German... ...and Jew! Who thinks he's Karl Marx. "Cohn Bendit the bandit. "These fake revolutionaries must be unmasked. Him! And him! And her! You got your brother to come along? How is he? Not too bad. This will do him good. We can't leave him there all alone. The world's changing, as of now. If the Sarbonne is a new Nanterre, it's proof. Soon, the workers will join us and then... ...the future will be all sunshine. Don't you think we're lucky to be our age,... ...right now and to all be together? Maybe. I don't know, Caroline. I'm not your age. He's such a pain about that. Tell him, revolution is not about age. I give up. Relax,... ...he's in good hands. In a few days, it will come out. Don't forget to send back the probe. Catherine, what are you doing? It's your fault too, right? I didn't tell them. They could nave been careful. Guys are so... It's bleeding, Caroline. It won't stop! We have to get a doctor. They can't find her here. Wait there, you two! You're lucky we pretend to believe your lies. You know you can die that way? What happens now? She can ask the intern but he's not a plumber. Go wait outside. You have no business here. The tension was suddenly more intense. Now they're charging, I'm told. Stones are flying all around. I'm passing over the chain. I'm still on rue Saint Jacques where the tension... ...was running high earlier. It hasn't cooled. Students are setting up another barricade... ... inside rue Saint Jacques to avoid being... Hide me. - What's up? - Nothing. Get dressed. Go back inside! You're very beautiful. But in no state to make love. Clean it up. My name's Catherine. J?remie. J?remie, this is Yves... ...and Herv?. Your girlfriend saved me. J?remie needs a hideout. He's at a hotel but can't go back. - You owe them money? - Yeah but it's not the money. The cops came. I'm a draft dodger! In that case, you can stay here. There's no room for four. Relax, we have another room opposite. Tonight, you sleep with Herv?. She's such a sweetie, your friend. She's really cool. I don't know how you do it. I couldn't take it. You can't do that! A few concessions and you fall into line. Better working conditions... ...won't bring equality. We voted. We're going back to work. You're sheep crawling before Capital. You're my son but you need a slap. Go ahead, asshole! You act uppity because I pay you to study? That's enough. Come on. Little brat. You too, Jean-Paul. I'm done with slavery. I'm never going back! Go ahead, die there. No more hard labor. I don't want to end up like you! France is indeed threatened by a dictatorship. There is an attempt to impose a rule... ...forced on us in a time of national despair. This rule... ...would of course be essentially that of the winner,... ...meaning that of totalitarian communism. I say no! The Republic will not give in. The people will rally. Progress, independence and peace will hold sway... along with liberty. Long live the Republic! Long live France! Where did they find 500,000 assholes to support that old fart? Do we hold a funeral vigil? I'm hungry. Let's go eat. What about J?remie? He has a key. I'll leave him a note. Wasn't there 50 francs? Yes, of course. What a dog! Tell me, we had a hard time tracking you down. You often change pads? I'm trying to understand. You were summoned on May 2. Why didn't you come? You weren't in France? No, it's that you can't be both a revolutionary and a soldier. You know the cost? No and I don't care. Fuck you! I don't see how I can keep you out of jail. You'll be court martialled. That was really stupid. Yes but... ...things have changed in two years. What's this, "things have changed?" Elsewhere maybe, but that's not my problem. Not here. This is not the Sorbonne. Parents pay for their kids to graduate... ...and that takes discipline. So forget your libertarian ideas and get some order in your class. One last thing... Yves! It's starting. We have to go to hospital. Relax, it's only the start. We'll do the dog. Sit down. Breathe through the nose. Now breath out... Well? What do I know? I'm a French teacher, not a doctor! Go ahead, I won't die! Now it's time to go to hospital. Perfect timing. Ludmilla! You realize you were born on May 1? Talk about class! Que viva Ludmilla! The baby of the revoluci?n! I went to California to pick grapefruit... ...and I also went to classes at Berkeley, in sociology. I didn't choose grapefruit. They were in season. I went there with a group of wetbacks. A group of what? That's what they call Mexicans who go work in the States. Because they have to swim across the Rio Grande. You don't know much. Afterwards, I went to the commune... ...with the Freedom of Speech guys from Berkeley. You know Freedom of Speech? What do you take us for? Complicated ztory. How many people, you say? Ten or fifteen permanently,... ...with visitors dropping in. Every day was a party. What did you live on? We did odd jobs. We have a vegetable garden... ...with a little weed, of course. How was the house? Pretty simple. Just one big room to cook and sleep. And make love. That's a commune. It's very utopian! You're scared of utopia now? Isn't that our dream? No boss, no class system? Equality between men and women. No contracts. Everyone is free to stay or go. No more morality. No more taboos. No more laws. Let's do it. Where's your house? In the Lot, near Figeac. It's my grandparents' farm. If we find 3,000 francs to pay the mortgage,... ...it's ours. It's adorable! Come on! Isn't it great? No, it isn't great. Let the sun shine in. You didn't lie, dumb ass. It's a cool place. Could you help me out and sell me some milk? I missed the grocery van. Come in. Come over here. He likes you. Usually, with strangers, he acts up. Right, Christophe? No, it's on me. I insist. Otherwise I won't dare come back. How about some coffee? Yes, please. That's Serge, my husband. He was skinny back then. He spent two years there. It was hard here, all alone. My brother fought in Algeria too.. I know it's none of my business,... ...but are you staying long? Funny spot for a vacation. We're not on vacation. We're staying. Up there? We decided to start a commune. You left the city to come live there? It's not my business. The things you see these days! He's funny. Peekaboo, do I get a smile? Thanks for the milk for Ludmilla. It's nothing. We're neighbors. If you need anything, just ask. Tell Jean-Claude he could have come to say hi... ...if he comes back. Jean-Claude? Yes, Jean-Claude. The boy with you in the car. I wasn't sure with that beard... ...but I recognized him when he came down. Jean-Claude, you're sure? He said he's called J?remie. J?remie? Where did he get that from? Has he stolen from you? Yes. He took the mortgage money and never came back. The mortgage? For his grandparent's house. The farm where we live. His grandparents were too poor to own a farm. Another of his scams. Typical Jean-Claude, the scam king. He lies and steals but he's not a bad kid. Who owns the house? No one. No one? That's not possible. Around here, it's common. Who'd want to live up there? Relax, no one will chase you out. Okay, thanks for the coffee. Go ahead. How's that? Tie it up! Jean-Paul is cool. And he's a great fuck. I have a sixth sense for studs. When he came to the factory, I said to myself: I bet he fucks like a god. And you can take it from me, he does. You have to hold it here and over here, see? I'll put my finger, now pull. It doesn't look too strong. I tried to tell him how to do it. Look what we found! Great. Where did you find them? They were behind a house down there. You can't help yourself! They're the G?nieys'. If you start stealing... They looked abandoned. You have to take them back. Oh no, my back's killing me. You can help them out. Okay, sure. I'm here to help! It's leaking! We all laugh about you at the caf?. When it comes to livening the place up, you liven it up. You and me know about life. Seriously, your buddies are dreamers. You're out of place up there. I need help, there's no one. I talked to Maryse and she agrees with me. We could fix up a place for you. And you can pay back the tiles from your pay. The proposal is adopted unanimously. You get the car on Thursdays to go to factories. You're not gone yet? You won't regret it? Regret what? I'm out before I go nuts too. I want a roof and toilets. Go back to consumer society and your shitty job. Loser! You think you're revolutionaries? You're just bums! Scat! Shouldn't you give her a lift? She has a thumb. Let her use it. Let's continue. Yves, it's your turn. I thought since we're not rolling in it,... ...I could take a teaching job in Figeac. Just for a while, to help out. Anyway, I'm no good at farming work... That means I'd take the car. But there's no class on Thursday. You could have talked to me? Why's that? I don't know... I'm directly concerned. No more than any of us. Yves is right. It's a collective decision. Come here, sweetie. You're sad. Really sad? Look at Mom. It was nothing. I really like you all,... ...but communal life's not my thing. With Maryse and Serge, it's easier. I'll be more use to you there. You're not mad? Huh, little sister? No, I mean it. You're making real progress. You'll get into a top collage. The problem is afterwards. You can't join the system and lose your soul. Take me, I won't teach for long. The commune is starting to work. Our lifestyle is revolutionary. We fundamentally undermine all production systems... ...and all social relations. Property, marriage, being faithful... ...all those bourgeois concepts are not for us. No more night No more day Never Always Do you hear their steps? They tread so lightly Oh, light feet Love has wings It is dark, child Stealing the sparks Do you hear their voices? Graves are deaf No more night No more day Never Always... I've never made love to a pregnant woman. Are you shocked? No. Pierre would like to try too. But he's shy. Hello. Won't you miss all this? Yes,... ...of course. Then stay. I can't, Catherine. I feel like I'm off track. But it's what we wanted. We live together, we work together. We're reinventing the world, our way. I feel we're caught in a trap. We've bacome inward-looking. We forget the world's suffering. That's unfair. There are meetings in the village. There are outreach groups. The factory visits. Go with Jean-Paul. Jean-Paul? He's forgotten the revolution. He wants to fuck women workers. I don't know. I want something else. It will help me to know you're happy here. I'm sorry. Caroline! You don't want a drink? I'll roll you a joint. It will relax you. Why are you so worried? Maryse knows what to do. Same as with the cows. She pulls it out by the legs. Where are you going? You don't want to lie down? No! This is how it's done. Go ahead, push! I bet it's a girl. If I lose, drinks are on me. It's a boy. Shit. Where's Yves? Yves! It's okay. We found him. This is Boris. Boris, this is your daddy. Isn't he beautiful? Is he okay? Don't I get a kiss? Pretty name, Dalila. Her dad was a Harki. Serge was friends with him. When he heard he'd been killed by the FLN,... ...he fought to bring her to France. That's the story. One kthing led to another... You could have... ...introduced us to her. Are you ashamed of us? No but... I don't know. I'm scared of Yves. I know what he thinks,... ..."Harkis betrayed their people. They're enemies" I'll tell him, it was France that betrayed the Harkis... ...and Yves... ...he can just shut up. He's not going to decide for the rest of us. Oh, Dalila. How are you? Fine. Michel left with Serge. They're poaching. Don't tell people. Can I hold him? - Want a coffee? - I don't have time. Goodbye, sweetie. - Will it be okay? - Relax. They'll keep Christophe company and Dalila can help me. Thanks again. Our bellies are our own! Legalize abortions! Spare me the act. I'lldeclare you unfit. You have friends in high places. I'm a conscript, like you. Only I don't have your connections. I didn't want to be here either. But if people like us don't change things from inside. You can't leave power to idiots and bastards. - You should have told me - I couldn't. I was scared you'd bee too proud. It makes me sick to owe your dad. What did you want? To do time, like Herv?? What about me? And the kids, here all alone? You're not alone. This is a commune! I don't belong to you. The gallows I've foresworn The others all did hang Idiots they have born Forbidden fruit, bitter tang The feathers of the quail And the fox's tail To hell with the devil's And his horns as well Heaven is for rebels And our planet where we dwell Everything, everywhere Desert dune, prison square What have I done wrong? I'm not blind. I know you avoid me. Move your arm. Who do you think you are? I sleep with who I want and I truly don't want you. Don't do your poor proletarian act, despised from above. You should be the Shah's communist son. Out the door, dormice The dormice for the doorman The rosebud for the rose Come give us a hand! No time, I'm grading papers. Give everyone 18. It will go faster. Isn't that how you passed in '68? Leave me alone. Don't want to get your clothes dirty? Shut up, for once, Jean-Paul. Yves brings in money. What's the problem? Don't judge him. He's a teacher, not a jail keeper. Money! He spends it all on babes in Figeac! Tell them you spend it on your students. For blowjobs, I hope. Do I mention the workers you fuck,... ...while you're supposedly spreading the word? Revolutionary, my ass! I can enjoy the money I earn! Sure. Yves is right. We all do what we want with our bodies. Shut up and get back to work. Fuck you, Catherine! You piss me off! Always giving orders. Worse than a foreman! You'd have been a great kapo. What about those parasites? Scream at them! Get to work, Sonny and Cher! Your music won't feed us! Asshole, get the hell out! You bet I'm leaving. Bitch! We won't miss that one. "Let's suppose we find a Nazi doctor... ...who escaped the punishment dealt out to others,... ...one of the men who practiced torture... ...and human vivisection." "Would you say there is a difference between what he did... ...and what would be done... ...officially in the hospitals and clinics of France?" "Some have gone as far as declaring, and this is outrageous,... ...that the human embryo is an assailant." "Would you agree, Minister, to see these assailants... ...thrown in the crematorium or filling up trash cans?" A congressman said that! Bastard. What's his name? Jean-Marie Daillet. Don't forget his name. It's so vile, it's hard to know whether to laugh or cry. Shame on you, bringing your daughter. I wanted her and she should know that. - Hussy! - Not hussy! I signed the Slut Manifesto and I'm proud of it. Get in the car. You've got everything? Did Mom give you a snack? Did you check? With this heat, I checked my traps early and dropped by. They're for you. Thanks. Caroline! Look what Michel brought. They're not fat but none are fatter. Thanks. Serge says it's the worst drought ever. Will you be okay? We've lost two goats. It's hard but we're holding up. But we've got hares and we can really use them! Thanks. Do you want a drink? No, thanks. I have to get back or Dalila will worry. Go! It's no time to make her worry. Hey, Michel. Come here. I wanted to ask you. Do you want a girl or a boy? - I don't care. - Tell me! If it's a girl, she won't have to go to war. You know why there's no rain? Because it's the year of the devil. The nutty numerologist from the Rochebrune commune told me. I don't know how she came up with it,... ...but she proved beyond any doubt... ...that 1976 is the same as 666! They're in trouble. Same as us. Don't give up, Yves. It will rain eventually. It's not the Sahel here. Caroline, I love your optimism but be realistic for once. I am realistic. The three of us are strong enough to get by. Michel and Serge won't let us down. Bullshit! You can see we're sinking. The others have gone. I'm still here. - I won't let you down. - I know. - Maybe... - Maybe nothing! Remember how happy we were last year,... ...all together in Larzac. There's no reason we won't be again. Wa just have to want it. I want it. And so do you. Sure. With your wanting, you'll make it rain. Yes, I'll do the rain dance if I have to. Come on, be strong! Garderem lou Latards! You'll both totally insane! Stay here if you want but I can't stand this life anymore. I can't stand your nitty weaving, your goats and vegetable patch. I can't stand it anymore. I'm sick of the countryside! Sick of it! It makes me want to vomit! I want exhaust fumes and bitumen. I want concrete. I don't want to go back to Paris. I didn't come all this way to give up. I know. We're not married. Maybe we messed up trying to reinvent the world here. So let's not mess this up too. If you want to leave, then leave. I'll respect the pact all the way. You piss me off with your noble spirit. What can I do but admire you and feel pathetic? Maybe you admire me, Yves. Maybe... But you don't love me anymore. Move in closer. Move together. We'll send it to Yves in Paris to show how you've grown. - Done. - Show me. I spoke to Mom. They're coming next week. Will you come over? I'll try not to spoil things. - How are they coping? - Well. I even spoke to your dad. I think they were truly relieved we called him Joseph. Imagine if you'd called him Mouloud. You know, Joseph is Youssef. He's my little Youssef. Pretty name, Youssef. You must be Ludmilla. Who's the little guy? Where are the others? Mom's with the goats. Let's go see her. Mom, there's a man here! You're too heavy to be carried. It's cold, isn't it? You could at least tell us what you did all those years. - Eight years is an eternity. - I don't have much to tell. I knocked around, worked in factories,... ...fought for the cause. A waste of time. No thanks, not tonight. Want some? It's home grown. This is not where it's at now. I'm going to Venezuela. I bet the grass is good. What will you do in Venezuela? - Fight in the war? - I haven't given up. If I need to take up arms, I will. Poor Herv?, you're crazy. Bedtime, before I explode. We'll leave you the joint. I'm zonked. You didn't see me. Tell them that. I'm leaving. Did you really kill him? I don't know, Catherine. We shot. The guard fell. Maybe it was me, maybe not. It happened so fast. Why? Why did you do it? You should have come back. No need. I was fighting for the cause. Stay here. And give yourself up. So they cut off my head? Bang! bang! Stop it. I said stop it! Stop, goddamn it! You hear me? I'm sorry. Come in. When we grew up, let's all get married. I party headquarters, in people's homes,... we await the result. You'll have it after the countdown. 10 seconds. Fran?ois Mitterand has been elected President. We repeat,... Mr. Fran?ois Mitterand has been elected... Cut it out! We can't hear! Let them celebrate, Serge. For them, the future is all sunshine. When Russian tanks are here, you'll celebrate. Mitterand! Mitterand! Mitterand! Now! - Let me go! - Don't move! - Fucker, let me go! - Don't move! Don't try anything. - Grab him. - Let me go! Don't move! Get him up. Come back. It's dangerous. No it's not. Come on. Leaave your mother alone. It's all your fault. If you hadn't led him here,... ...hadn't mixed him up in this, it wouldn't have happened. I said I didn't know. I don't see how this accident happened. This " accident". You claim it was an accident. Edmond, don't say that. It was an accident. It wasn't an accident. It wasn't an accident! It's your fault! I was wrong. Wrong to have come back. I don't know what I expected but I know I caused you pain. Life seperated us. It was best that way. I made choices you would't have shared. I can't impose the consequences. You have no place here. Accepting your visits would be punishing an innocent. Forget me. Forget what I've become. Imagine I'm far away,... ...that I'm happy and free, in another country or era. Don't imagine this prison and these bars. They don't exist for you. They can't exist for you. I know you're strong enough. Forget me. EIGHT YEARS LATER Not bad, huh? Cut it out, Boris! Country bumpkin! It's springtime. Let's make hay. Give us a hand. There are ten more trays. What's the rush? You've got all those to plant. You should think it over. You're not going to tell me to be sensible? Were you sensible when you moved here? Did you listen to your father? I'm sorry, Ludmilla. You're right. You have to live out your desires. - But times have changed. - No. You're just older. I bet I'm the fastest. You're the first to stay so long. Turns out I have a taste for farm life. I meant to stay 3 months after college... ...to clear my head. I really like Catherine. She helps me a lot. Yeah, I know. She's an amazing woman! But you'll see, it wears thin. She says we're all free but she controls everything. You saw, she hates me getting away. You're all wrong. A mother can't let her child go easily. That's life. It's natural. You know,... ...I felt really bad about my mother's despair... ...when I left Iran. And she organized it. I was 15. It was that or the front. She wanted to save me. For her, it's like I died in Iraq. I may never see her again. A family is precious. You'll see when you're far away. Ludmilla, help! I want you to stay over night. You know I can't do that. Tell Maryse you slept with me. It's only a half-lie. Farivar can keep a secret. Right? I'm going to study law too. You can give me advice. Hurry up and pass that exam. I hate only seeing you on vacation. Where are you going? To join my alibi. She could have stayed. Sometimes I think she hates me. No, you're imagining it. She misses her singing class. You're so sweet. You stick up for her. It's only normal. It will do her good to get away from me. They've known each other since birth. I never wondered about their relationship. You should have. I don't want the village to know. Serge, I'm sure you're imagining it. I'm not saying they never experimented. It's normal. Homosexuality is part of childhood development. - Boris is only 16. - 17. Christophe is nearly 19. He's a man, not a teenager. It's not when they were kids but now. Last night... Christophe slept with Ludmilla. You believe what the kids say. Okay listen,... ...I told you what I think. Christophe is my only son. I love him. I'm not sure it's a good thing. I hope it's a phase, like you say. But if it continues,... ...I'd like... ...you to tell Boris... ...they have to behave when they're here. Why don't you tell him yourself? We don't discuss these things. I come to play here... ...in memory of all those who died because of this wall. We have to go. We'll be late. You think we should celebrate? Of course. We're not going to mourn a dictatorship. I'm Boris, and you? - Where are we going? - Nach Berlin! It's late. I should yell at you. But I forgive you. We had a wild time too. What's that? - What happened? - Leave me alone! - It's nothing. - Boris. Yves, drop it. He's allowed to celebrate. What's that? That's my question. Bad methods. Come on, Boris. It's unbelievable. What did you do to provoke them? Nothing. They were looking for a fight. I was in the wrong place. - So go to the police. - I can't They can't get away with it. Dominique, can you explain to Yves. Boris doisn't want to tell the cops he got beat up for being a fag. That guy freaked me out. Did you know blowjobs were risky? It's crazy we don't know this! We wait 10 days to find out! In London, you'll forget. I'm not going to Ludmilla's. I won't leave you by yourself. Go. Your ticket is non refundable. I'm big enough to handle it. I like your t-shirt. Ah ouais? Je I'ai trouv? ? New York. Drop it! It's no big deal. I chickened out. It's just stupid pride. You can think what you want. I was out of place. Why humiliate myself by being mediocre? You understand! She could have tried. Tell her! You're both so conventional and hard-core monogamous. Marriage is over the top and totally out. Not at all. Marriage is totally in these days. It means you're really in love. If you're really in love, you don't need it. You're a bad influence on her. Drop it, please. I refuse to ruin my life like Mom. Anyway, you're over the top. You sleep with every boy you see. Christophe deserves better. I'm sure it hurts him. He loves you. I love him too. Anyway, you were right. Nice place. I've never been here. You're not coming with us? Later! I like this one too. Ah ouais? Je I'ai trouv? ? Paris. Oh Paris, really? So, you like French stuff? You hate me? You're right. I hate myself too. Please, stop it. You think I waited piously for you to come home on vacation? I fucked up too. No point anymore asking why or how. We're in deep shit, Boris. We're in really deep shit. No chickening out. Are you scared? It's awful. We're both HIV positive. But you don't have to worry because... ...there are good drugs to treat it. The nurse convinced us. I'm sorry. I have to tell you something... Don't get upset. I'm HIV positive. AIDS! Mitterrand you're killing us! Our bloods on your hands! I was scared but it was a trip. The cops didn't even arrest us. Mittterrand's not crazy. He's never mentioned AIDS... ...but he won't lock up sick people. Especially me with my 54 remaining T4 cells. 54, that's huge! Enough to do years in jail! I have 12. How about you? Last month, I had 250. And you? I'm negative. And you, Boris? I'm positive with 500 T4 cells. Capitalist! And you? 105. Not bad. Maryse, don't do it. I know what you'll say. - You know I'm right. - No! I'm his mother. He needs me and I can't sit around. Did you call him first? Of course not. You know it's not what he wants. Maryse, they're loud and clear. If they wanted us, they'd say so. They're scared, Maryse. - Scared of their mothers? - But, no. Scared of our grief, of what everyone sees on our faces. Loot at me. Look. I know I look sad even when I smile. Come on,... ...let's go home. The best thing we can do now is to stay here. I want them to know they can come. Day or night. We'll be here. Unbelievable. Listen to this: "You'll be disappointed. "Believe me, I am too." "I wanted to be there with you and Farivar." "I wanted to meet his family but I'm a hostage to my farm." And she sends all her love! I don't believe it! It's nothing but lies. She disapproves of everything I do. It's best that way. No nutcase in hippie rags at the ceremony. Ludmilla, darling. Don't talk about Catherine like that. I don't like you insulting her. She's against marriage. It's her right. She's still a wonderful woman. Let me. Or maybe she's jealous. How do you mean, jealous? I'm not naive, you know. You slept with her. What's got into you? I know her well. That old free love routine,... ...saying sex is separate from morality,... ...we can all do what we want with our bodies... Her usual blah blah... Nothing new. Why would you say no? Am I right? If you're right, what would it change? I love you, Ludmilla. I'm going to marry you. It changes nothing but we'd start out on better footing. I slept with Catherine. There you are. It wasn't so hard to say. I love you and I'm very happy we're getting married. Get out. Tell Aunt Marjene to help me dress if she really wants to. What are you doing, we gonna be late! I'm ready, I'm ready. She is all yours. My dear Ludmilla, let's go! Where is that dress now? In the dressing room. I can't take this, Boris. It's not what I want us to be. I know I want something you can't give. What did I do wrong? You know that doesn't count. Face up to reality for once. No sex for months... ...because the fucking virus and the AZT... ...wipe out my libido. It drives you crazy too. How many nights have you spent here lately? I prefer not to see you at all. At least for a while. I'm sicker than you, Boris. Do what I say. And don't argue. In one direction. Then the other. We start over... That's all we can do. The AIDS trial is not over! Chirac, The AIDS trial is not over! This can't be happening! This can't be happening! Wonderful! Life can start up again! Bravo, Chirac! We won! There's my mom. You're not handing out leaflets? We did our demonstration in town. I taught Catherine "killer eye contact". Ready? Did Mom say I'm going to study organic farming? Of course. Congratulations. Organics are the future. I know. I'm learning a lot. Your methods are out of date. You're telling me what to do! Remember, I knew you in diapers and I'm a pioneer. Like it? I get Boris' room? He won't mind? He isn't here. Take me to the cemetery for All Saints Day. All Saints Day? Time flies. Admit you don't care about religion. It's true. I want to visit Dad's grave. I want to go with you. Let's go help the others. It's heavy. Wait, Mom. I'll take it. I feel like a political refugee. Look. There's some truth in that. More like family reunification. Not at all. It's migrant labor. We're going to fix your farm. It's time to get serious, right? Take this! Catherine, we knew fascism was coming. You weren't radical enough. I did what I had to. I'd do it again. It's easy to say that. You don't have to fight them today. I'd rather get insulted in Orange than be in here. Sorry, Herv?. I didn't mean it. If only there had been more of us then. You can't rewrite history. You decided to go. You never asked me to come. You'd have come? You didn't ask me. I'll handle it. You should be exhausted. No, thanks Marjane, feel great today. Be nice. She hasn't rested long. You know I'm right. It's no reason to be rude to my aunt. I'm not married to your aunt. No, you're married to me. Like it or not, that gives you obligations to her and my family. I have no obligations to anyone? I work and look after my family. She can't talk to me like that. For a submissive wife, try an Iranian. Go spend Christmas in France. It's time you saw your own family. You'll understand me. When you come back, you'll apologize to my aunt... ...and things will be fine again. Same old cheese smell. You're seeing Yves in Paris? Of course. He didn't come to London either. He hates travelling. He doesn't come here often. I've always been hopeless with men. I've spent my whole life waiting for them. I let them go so they didn't feel trapped. But I think deep down,... ...I always hoped they'd come back. Yves, Herv?... ...and so many others. Like Farivar, for example? He's been honest with you. I'm not surprised. It's why you skipped our wedding? What's going on in your head? Nothing happened between Farivar and me. Nothing important. Yeah, I know. Sex is only sex. I just wanted you to know that I know... ...and I knew before I got married. That's not why I'm not going back to London. You're leaving Farivar? I don't think so. I just need to breathe. To step back from it. Sometimes I feel I made the wrong choices. - So? - Sure enough! I got the job... and 30% more than they were offering. They can always dream. Computer engineers with my experience... ...are as rare as hens' teeth. So you're staying? You catch on fast. I also signed the lease on that great apartment. I won't be here long. What does Farivar say? Don't say it. You can't criticize me. And it's too late to start teaching me how to run my life. Time for bed. We're getting up early. We have mouths to feed. It's unbelievably easy for you. 5 million unemployed people. You snap your fingers and get a job at 20,000 a month. Internet's the future, that's all. You should drop law and get into it as well. You'd have a great carrier. You'd have to work a bit harder. You really don't get it. Fuck my career. I have no future. Understand? I'm fighing today,... ...now,... ...to stay alive a few more years or months. That's all I have time for. How are you? - And you? - Okay. A beer. Boris. Philippe, this is the infamous Boris. Hi. I keep telling him it's over between us. He can't help being jealous. Not at all. Yeah, sure! But don't worry. I like you being jealous. It's true, Christophe's secretive. He keeps talking about you and we only meet by chance. You don't often call me. Let's not fight like ex-lovers in front of Philippe. I just got out of hospital. I had pneumocystis. I'm still tired but I'm okay. You didn't tell me. I wasn't on my deathbed, Boris. Philippe was there to pamper me. I can't call every time. What's news at the front? I'm run off my feet with work. That's why I never call. Same old excuse. We're working with French-speaking African groups. They struggle to get information. It's all in English. We provide as much as we can... ...and help them set up projects. It's hard work. You know,... ...sometimes I miss going to Act Up. AIDS is now! Treatments fast! AIDS = We die! Indifference lives on! I don't recognize you. I'm Boris. Are you new? I'm a volunteer at AIDES. I'm Vincent. I'm a shrink. I work with HIV positive people and their families. An AIDES volunteer in a paddy wagon! I felt for once it was worth helping out. Protease inhibitors are very promising. Like Act Up, I think we have to implement protocols fast... ...and reticence from the labs is criminal. Wow. Hard-line! You're not in the wrong clan? There are laws, Ludmilla. I could sue you for desertion. I'm away temporarily. I didn't desert you. You work. You leased an apartment. Judges won't see it that way. I couldn't stay with my dad forever. You could have come home. Listen, Ludmilla. I love you. I'll try to understand you. But you're making me pay for your own mistakes. You wanted to get married. You wated a normal family life. You locked yourself into the wrong life. You weren't raised for it. You should have seen it before. Next time, stay longer than two hours. We'll pick up Dariush from kindergarten... ...and take him to the park. He loves animals. Philippe Bouba. I think it's mine. My sister gave it to me. It's new. Be right back. Hello. Ah, Philippe? I'm at Saint Bernard's. How serious? Boris. We were making plans just yesterday. He was weak. I was realistic. But he was supposed to get out. When I came this morning... It's over, Boris. I can't accept it but it's over. Did you call Maryse? They'll get here too late. You have to hold on, buddy. Hold on. Don't let go. Not now. The nurses have finished if you want to see him. Go ahead. I'll wait. I can't face it now. I'll come get you? You needed to insist. It's sad Serge and Maryse aren't here. I didn't insist because I understand them. I could have done without myself. But it has to be done. It was here. No, it's here. The bridge was here. You could see thes rock from the cabin entrance. It's the right clearing? Definitely. Definitely. Then it's near enough. No, why me? Because he wanted it. I can't! I don't know how. It's easy. You unscrew the lid. You scatter the ashes. The wind blows it in our eyes and we all yell. There's no wind! Then we'll cry. You're sure? You won't have dinner with Phillippe and the kids? I hate leaving you like this. Thanks, Catherine. My mind's made up. You've been inside two months. Just try. Sorry, I don't want to. Maryse. I need you. Drop it, Catherine. I'm sorry. Excuse me. I can't stand seeing Boris. I can't stand it! I can't help asking myself,... ...why Christophe? Why is he dead? Why? Did my lawyer ask you that? Listen,... ...he's sure he can get you a shorter sentence. You just have to try. Renounce being what I am? I'm not saying deny who you are. Just stop constantly proclaiming your status... ...as a political prisoner. Think what you want. I'm begging you, make an effort,... ...to get out of here and come back to us. Outside or in, what does it change? Don't you get it yet? You never leave jail. I've been dead for 20 years. You have no right. You didn't die 20 years ago. I didn't see Michel that day. I don't know what happened. Listen, that's not what I meant. You think I don't feel guilty? It was an accident, not your fault. Even if it was an accident, it's my fault. You may never accept the truth. I've known it for 20 years. Why is it so hard? We didn't deserve this world. All this hatred. This shit. This violence. I'm sick of crying. I can't take anymore. Family planning. The cooperative was you too? Communal childcare. That was a real battle. No, I know. The local radio. That was the best. Antoine didn't come to hear us... ...compare old war stories. I wanted to let him relax... ...in exchange for the two hours he spent cheering me up. You're doing his head in. Okay, we'll shut up. If you stick around, I have plenty to tell you. Lucky for him, Antonio's off to Africa for a year. What for? I'm a geologist. I'm going to run a well-building program. That's great. I didn't expect to do this again. Free love is a hippie tradition I'm very attached to. Flowers too. They're essential. If I come back to see you after years on the road,... ...I won't have to knock? There was never a lock. No need to throw out the key. It's beautiful. Yes. I never get sick of it. I can see why. Let's go inside. One day I'll take you to the farm. It's a great place... ...and my mom's worth a visit. Then we'll do Sunday dinner with your folks. I always wanted formal introductions. I'll even wear a tie. Forget the tie and the introductions. I haven't seen them in 10 years. Thought he was De Gaulle and took a fall. Who told him to dissolve parliament? Not a friend. It's nice to see France is not totally right wing. But saying it's totally left wing is going way too far. It's Catherine. She's calling a cell phone! I want to talk to her. Ludmilla, I'd like to make an appointment with you. No problem. I think I need a website for my company. How about Wednesday? Agreed. Dad? What's wrong? Herv?'s getting out. He got early release. Catherine wants us both to meet him at the exit. Herv? got out yesterday. His lawyer said it was today. He didn't get it wrong. Don't you see? Herv? told him to lie. You'd said I'd come? Can you come back to the farm? It's complicated. I said I'd be back. I could say I'm too weak to drive but that's enough lies for today. I'm asking you to come. Okay. I missed this place too. And I ended up coming back. It wasn't really a choice. I leaped at the chance. Sometimes you have to force yourself to do what you really want. I forgot why I left. I don't regret it. I never regretted it. Dariush, wave to Uncle Boris. What's this? It's my latest blood test. And? You can see. I don't understand a thing. My viral load is undetectable. The tritheraphy works better than expected. It's been less than a year. Less than a year since Christophe died. Think about it. Less than a year. Want some honey? Strawberry jelly? Look Dariush. It's daddy. How are you? I won't say I don't fear death. But I want you to be brave enough to tell me the truth. In its current state, your tumor is inoperable. But we can't exclude an improvement after chemotheraphy,... ...allowing us to envisage a possible operation. You didn't answer my question. Don't lose hope,... ...even if your chances, statistically,... ...and I mean statistically,... ...are fairly limited. There's no hope. I'd say very little. "What is homosexuality... ...if not rejection of one's sexual opposite." "What is rejection of this difference... if it is not exclusion?" "Homosexuality as a social norm... ...would favor establishing exclusion as a social rule." "That is why no advanced civilization... "... ever held it up as a way of life." "It is also the reason why... ...all civilizations that recognized it as normal became decadent." What giberish. It's hard to know whether to laugh or cry. Who is this Boutin to say such crap? I thought we'd moved on. What did you think? You transformed society by practicing free love? Spare us your moralizing! We didn't dream of marriage and all being the same. This PACS is about aspiring to norms... ...so it makes the norm's keepers more rigid. It shows our protest is deeper than yours. To live outside the norm, you needed the norm. The PACS fundamentally undermines marriage... ...and norms, not just for guys. So you and Vincent are planning to... Get PACSed. The law hasn't passed yet. The Socialists aren't too enthusiastic. Jospin is such a puritan. I brought back a Dogon divining rod. I love you. I want to live here forever. Antoine. I want that too. But I'm going to die. I'm going to die soon. It's pretty! Come on, the strawberries are not ripe. Give them to me. Drop them. - Why? - They're not ripe. They're green. I have to warn you. If you expect a geyser, you'll be disappointed. Do us the honor of the first flow. I turned it too tight. All this water's making me thirsty. To Antoine's well. Nice name, Antoine's well. - Thanks. - How are you? Let's call it Antoine's well. Too late. I've given it another name. It's Catherine's well. I'm embarrassed. I'd prefer something more "peace and love"... ...like the love well or the peace well. Mom, why not flower well while you're at it? Don't change a name. Never! It brings bad luck. To Catherine's well. To Catherine's well. Antoine is going back to Mali to work... ...and I'm going with him. You're going to Mali? You never even came to London. Ludmilla, this is different. We're talking big love! It's true. Antoine bewitched me with his Dogon tales. Staying long? I don't know. Maybe. I hope so. I thought you'd give in. You're not telling them? Maryse, I don't want to discuss it anymore. You promised to cover my lie. I'm counting on you. I promised but I don't like it. It's the first time we disagree. Did you think what we'll do if they show up? They never come here. They have too much to do in Paris. I like it that way. A pig? or a goat. Whatever's needed. It depends on the situation. I'm not convinced. We need to wipe out the international finance system. With a revolution? That's so old-fashioned. You prefer handouts? Don't pretend you don't get it. Microcredit lets people sidestep big financial powers. It's a great idea that works. Maybe you're right. But selling your company is crazy. You sound like Catherine. We share more than just you. What are you going to live on? You work, don't you? Oh shit! I went through this 30 years ago. You'll criticize me for selling out... Farivar? Michael, three and a half kilos. Congratulations. Take care. I suppose I can't not go? I hate maternity wards. Me too. Does a dirty cow get me microcredit? Shut up! It's funny, he looks a bit like Yves. Have a girl next to see if she looks like her grandma. By the way, I got a card last week. It's of some Dogon Thing,... ...a ladder, I think. Strange but nice. She has a nerve. - Who? - Catherine. She refused to come to my wedding, didn't come for Dariush's birth. Now she's in some lost village in Mali. Where we can't contact her. You'll stress out Michael. It's ugly here. It's so ugly. Antoine, I don't want to die in such an ugly place. She wanted to hear it all. Every day I had to tell her. I ended up making a sort of program,... ...like a tour guide... ...showing her Dogon country. I think she really believes she went on that journey. You realize what you did? You had no right to lie to us. No right! Ludmilla, it's what Mom wanted... I don't care! He didn't nave to obey her. Think about us! We count for something. We needed to know! You too. You all betrayed us! You're disgusting, all of you! She'll hear you. Don't take them off. You could go blind. Got nothing better to do than watch TV? You didn't open the mail. I think it's something important. Mr. Boris Derlon. It's my birth certificate. The file's complete. There's a problem. What? There's a mistake? Yours took so long that mine won't be valid tomorrow. Shit. We'll get another one. We could go now. It closes at 5 o'clock. Right now? Yes, unliss you've changed your mind. Of course I haven't changed my mind. It's good you're so sure. I want you to forget the PACS. I want us to adopt. With a PACS, they won't let us. Of course, I've already voted. What? How do you know that? Right, of course. It's not definite, is it? Okay, we'll talk later. That was Yves. Le Pen's in the run-off. Shit. If it's true, it's a disaster. Hello. He's all yours. He's been like this for a week. Fascism, Nazism, Authoritarianism History of the French Extreme Right Nationalism, Anti-Semitism and Fascism in France Anne Frank's Diary Dad, you're going overboard. You know what will happen. We'll vote Chirac, end of story. You're crazy. I'll never vote for the right. They'll have total power. It's awful! Like under Giscard and Pompidou. Or worse, De Gaulle! You don't know what it's like. It will be worse than De Gaulle. How did it come to this? What did we do wrong? Where did we go wrong? You know, it's the fault of May '68. You killed authority. Now France wants a father. Dad. We're big enough to make our own mistakes. Stop thinking the world revolves around your mistakes. Catherine would be furious. Furious, furious. What will we do? What's left? I'd say the right to disagree. To fuck who we want, when we want. MAY 2007 May 1968... ...imposed intellectual and moral relativism on us. See how the heritage of May '68... ...wiped out the Jules Ferry school tradition,... ...which was a school of excellence, merit and respect. The heritage of May '68... ...introduced cynicism to society. See how disputing all ethical bearings... ...helped weaken capitalism's morality,... ...how we laid the groundwork... ...for unscrupulous capitalism. Golden handshakes, thug bosses. Can you cut the radio? I'll turn the page of May '68... I understand. It hurts to know he'll win. When I was younger, I'm talking almost 40 years ago,... ...I knew a woman. A soldier's daughter too, who broke with her family. But she'd never have given in. Sometimes I imagine it's her. I can see the photos. Her in front of Bush, flowers in her hair,... ...demanding he get troops out of Iraq. That would be hilarious, right? Herv?? You imagined it too. You don't feel them? You're pulling my leg. A little. I don't know. Sometimes I feel they're here. When I'm in a black hole. It happens sometimes. Communards, come back! Get up! Come out of your graves! Come give us a hand! Light the flame of revolt again in the good city of Paris! The people of Versailles are back! You can't trust ghosts. Never here when we need them. It's the wrong place to call on them. They won't come back where they were massacred. Let's try Montmartre. Poor things. Don't show them this! Leave them in peace. I'll take you home. - Got booze? - Plenty. Hash too. Cocaine? That's common in your set? I don't take that crap. I still have some principles. This is just the start. Keep on fighting!
