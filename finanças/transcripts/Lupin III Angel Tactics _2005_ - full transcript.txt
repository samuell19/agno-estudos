Lupin the Third. Angel Tactics. A Piece of Dream. With a Scent of Murder. We'll have Lupin... do the job. And we will... take the treasure. Wait a minute! No. There's nothing beyond this point. What's the problem if there's nothing? Groom Lake Air Force Base Now look, Lupin has announced that they're after the item... under tight security in this laboratory... Metal... Or... Meta... That they'll be stealing the Original Metal. Inspector, what is this Original Metal? Well, that's... It's actually a piece of the UFO which crash-landed near here! That's what Lupin is after! This way. Mmm hmmm. Right, Inspector Zenigata? That's right. How are things, Inspector Zenigata? Oh, Doctor. The security is perfect. Not even a rat can squeak through. Very well. Now, who is this lovely lady? She's nobody. She's like my assistant. No! I'm not his assistant! I have been assigned to work under Inspector Zenigata as of today. I'm Detective Emily O'Brien. Nice to meet you! I see. Not even Lupin can get in here with such tight security, right? No, we can't let our guard down. When Lupin says he'll do it, he never fails to show up. So, he never gives up on the target he has set his eyes on. Good work, Inspector Zenigata. You know everything. You. That's... We thought we'd take precautions as well. We prepared a dummy of the Original Metal. Dummy? Yes. We will swap the real thing with this. I see. That's a good idea. Let's get started before Lupin gets here. Well then, allow me to begin. Hold it right there! Emily! Well, uh... we're going to lock in the Doctor? Just do as I say! Out of my way! Let me through! He's Lupin! What are you talking about? Good job, Old Man. If you've already figured it out, then this is of no use. Yes, my name is Lupin the Third. I'll take you down today. I dunno about that. Later, Old Man! Huh? He went up! After him! We're not wanted here? We're not... Carry on. Lupin! Hey, Old Man! Lupin?! Too bad! Come again! Damn you Lupin! Hey! Don't push! Lupin is up there! After him! Go, Jigen! Lupin! I'll take care of it here! Thanks, Goemon! Lupin! I'll catch you! Hey, Old Man! Jigen and Goemon? They're down there! Whoa! All right, Jigen! Go fetch! I'm not a dog! Found it! Wait a sec, Lupin... That's a... Don't you know what it is? It's a UFO. A UFO. I've always wanted to ride in one. Hurry! Zenigata is coming! Alrighty, then. Let's go. Can you pilot it? Leave it to me! They're here! Wait, Lupin! Catch him! Lupin! I know! Damn, what's wrong with this piece of junk? What the heck's this? Put my hands...? I see. I won't let you get away, Lupin. Old Man... You sure you wanna do that? It's not safe there! Yeah! It's flying! Inspector! Don't let them get away, Emily! Close the doors! Close it?! What?! I don't get this! I'll push whatever! I won't let you. We'll win! Don't open it, Emily! The other way! Hey, it's open! Lucky! You can't get away from me, Lupin! You're under arrest! Damn! I'll get you, Lupin! I swear, I'll arrest you! See ya, Old Man! Damn it, Lupin! Don't move, idiot! This is why... I said I didn't want to ride in a UFO. Don't bitch. Anyway, it's incredible. Not even a scratch on it. There's our ride. Lupin! Good work! Fujiko. I knew it. I was wondering why you were stealing this piece of junk. You wanted it as a present for Fujiko? Stupid! What's wrong with it? Don't say it like that, Jigen. It's like a piece of a dream. It... happened in July of 1947. A UFO crash-landed Near Roswell, New Mexico. U.S. armed forces took the alien on board... and the remains of the UFO to Area 51. That's what's known as the Roswell Incident. And this is a piece left from that. You mean that junky UFO we rode? It's a fake that the U.S. made; A copy of the original. This is the only piece left from the original. And I wanted to make a one-of-a-kind... ring with this, you see? Right, Fujiko? That's so romantic. It came from thousands of light years away. So wonderful. Bullshit. But Lupin, I heard it's harder than diamonds. How are you going to cut it? Isn't it obvious? We've gotta ask him. Hey, Goemon-chan, chop this up with your Zantetsu sword. No. The Zantetsu sword shall not be used on such objects. Don't be so uptight! Enough! Fine, you tight-ass! I'll never ask you again! It's the galactic metal anyway, so you don't... even know if the Zantetsu sword can cut it! I know it can't! It's not the Zantetsu sword. It's a Zannen sword. A Zannyo-kan? Whatever. What's wrong, Goemon-chan? I won't allow you to ridicule the Zantetsu sword. I will chop that metal to pieces! You ready, Goemon? Do it. There's nothing the Zantetsu sword can't cut! It really can't be cut with the Zantetsu sword, either? What the... Oh man, that thing really nicked it. Now I feel bad about that. My incompetence caused damage to the sword. I am going on a journey of training. Farewell. Oh man, he's leaving. It really got to him. I'm gonna get going now, too. Later, Lupin. What, you're leaving, too, Jigen? What? Fujiko-chan! Let's have fun! Jacket! Jacket! Jacket! Jacket! H-Hey! Lupin! I stole it just like you asked. So give me a prize. No! Stop it! You haven't found a way to make a ring out of it. So save the prize until later. I'm sorry, Lupin. I'll give you a small prize. And for the heck of it, I'll take this. Ow! Look at that! Ow! Ow! I need to cool it! Water! Water! Water! Water! Damn! Why isn't it coming out? Hey! They cut the water? Damned piece of crap! Damn... It came off... I need to cool it! I need to cool it! You think I'm that cheap? Did you really think I'd agree for this little money? As if. The rest is in the trunk. Go get it. What's the rush? Too bad, kid. I'm not that kind of woman. No way! Original Metal shattered?! Wait! Where's the real deal? I don't know! Tell me! I really don't know! You still don't want to tell me? You've got some guts. Wait! Damn you're persistent! This is Lady Jo. The one Fujiko had was a fake. The real Original Metal must be with... Jigen, Goemon, or Lupin. Man... It feels like luck ran away from me with Fujiko. I'm broke. This was handed to me by my grandfather. Can use this as collateral? No. Excuse me, but can you give me some chips for this? Give me some. No! Give me some chips or I'll arrest you! Don't underestimate the Japanese police! Let me go! Stop the violence! Humph! If you'd like, I could help you with your finances. Insurance Inspector Sophie? Of course, you are to return double... of the original amount when you win. Do we have a deal? We do. Okay then. Let me go, you scum! Give us all the money you got if you wanna live. Or else... Who's there?! Play time is over. Or else you'll lose your life next. Dude! You'll pay for this! Run! We'll get you for this! It's not safe around here. Women shouldn't walk around here alone. Thank you! You really saved me. Later. Be careful on your... You forgot this. When did she... Give me that. It's not a toy. I'm Linda. I'm a magician. You can have this back too. Man, you steal like a bandit. I work for a jazz bar near here. Do you want to come by for a bit? I'll buy you a drink. I only drink bourbon. It's a deal. We did like you asked. Now give me the money we talked about. That was a really good round! Those chips brought me all the luck! Here's double the original amount, and some more to say thanks. Keep those. Thank you. I will. So, what does an insurance inspector want with me? I want you to give back the Original... Metal that you stole, Lupin. You went straight to the point. I hate beating around the bush. Me too. So, the U.S. Department of Defense had... insurance on a piece of UFO, huh? Sounds like you don't trust me. It smells totally fishy! Looks like we need to get to know each other better. I totally agree! I'm Lupin the Third! Did you get it? There is a lot about you that I want to know. The night is still young, Lupin. Excuse me. Are you the legendary honer, Higashi Jingoro? Would you hone this sword? You must have gotten something wrong. I'm just an old man who likes to fish. You've got the wrong person. His eyes... I'm sure of it. He's Higashi Jingoro. Thank you. What were you thinking, looking so scary? Oh, it's nothing important. I'm Kaoru. Nice to meet you. I didn't expect a big-time thief... like you to be gambling at a casino. You think so? Once in a while there are nights I wanna go all out at a casino. And tonight is that kind of night? Yeah. So, who has the Original Metal? Who knows? Let's forget about it. Let's have fun. Sophie-chan! I'll go get us some more drinks. Good. You can act dumb for now. I'll make you tell me everything with this. Here you go. Thank you! Cheers! Now listen, Lupin. Answer all my questions honestly. Yes. Right now, who has... Who has... the Original Metal? That would be... Jigen Daisuke. Thanks. What Lupin consumed is truth serum that makes a person answer any question truthfully, then die. Goodbye, Lupin. This is Sophie. I found out who has the Original Metal. Linda, it's Jigen Daisuke. Good luck, Linda. As if! Good thing I threw this in my mouth... The super absorbent sponge. Man, that's scary. Thank you for coming. Keep the change. Don't worry. That's for the tropical fish. Fujiko isn't the only one anymore. Another woman came after the Original Metal. There really must be something behind it. Sorry, Jigen. Please be quiet, sir. Sorry 'bout that. It's a nice place. Not bad. And for the next act, you there, handsome man by the counter. Hey, that's you. Me? Go on. Go easy on me. Welcome to hell, Jigen Daisuke! Hey! What's all this about?! Give me the Original Metal! What?! Original Metal? Lupin told us! Now give it up! Lupin did?! God damn it, shoving this shit my way! I don't have it! I screwed up! It's me. Sorry, I let Jigen get away. But looks like Jigen doesn't have it, either. That means there's just Goemon. No way... My confession poison didn't work? Stop here. Yes. Sorry! You need to try harder than that! Bye! Kaoru. I heard that people have seen you around here. Please eat up. I wanted to help you. Or am I bothering you? No. Thank you. How did you know? It's obvious. There is no way a person who needs a cane can ascend this mountain. So I guessed that the cane must be a disguise. Not bad, Goemon. You know my name?! Who are you? My name is Tsujigiri Kaoru. And this sword is... the ghostly sword, Benizakura. What do you want from me? What do I want? To steal the Original Metal that you may be carrying. But I don't care about that anymore. Now that I've drawn this sword, it demands blood. Your blood. Hey, man! It's me! Isn't he here? Hello... Damn, why doesn't he clean up?! Man, what's this? Damn noisy! We're not open yet. Aiya! Aiya, young master. Your grandfather... has treated me very well. Looks like you're doing well, Chingensai. What's up? Did you find another treasure? And this is it. They say it's a piece of the fallen UFO, but I wanted you to determine the truth. Man, this is a surprise! I can't beat her with a dull sword. Retreat is also a tactic of war! Wait! Hmm... This is not the space metal you claim. What? Original Metal is a special alloy that we've developed, although... as a security measure, we've told the... public that it's a piece of a UFO. Sign this. Sign? I'm giving you an official order. I'm using an extralegal measure, and will... have you command our special ops unit. Huh? Me, did you say?! Now that this has happened, I'll have you deal with it to the end. Remember this. You must prevent the Original Metal... from being taken out of the country. Unconfirmed intelligence says that an... underground group is already going after Lupin. Retrieve the Original Metal before they get to it. I'm counting on you! Yes, sir! I, Zenigata Koichi, will arrest Lupin even if it costs my life, and will take back... the Original Metal... Man, Lupin... I'll get you... Inspector Zenigata. I heard that you'll be commanding a special ops unit. Good luck, sir. You came just to say that to me? No. I just wanted to say thank you to you. Even though it's only been a short time, thank you for training me. Honestly, though, I'm not entirely happy. If possible, I wanted to work under you awhile longer. A klutzy rookie like me serves no... purpose other than to slow you down... But I wanted you to train me more! Also... we let Lupin and the gang get away and even had... the Original Metal stolen all because of me! So I wanted to arrest Lupin myself. That's my only regret. Have you heard of this? In Japan, they say that the kids who don't... perform well are more precious to the parents. You sure are a klutzy rookie. It means that we care even more for rookies like you. So... I'll talk to my superiors to arrange... for you to work under me again, if you still want. Inspector! But I'll give you a harder time than before, so be ready. If you think it'll be easy... It's sweet! Yes! Thank you, sir! What did you do that for?! Huh? What's this? Perfume?! You use this?! I-I'm sorry, sir! It's only for private use! Of course it is! I don't want you to smell like perfume during an operation! Hello? This is Zenigata. What?! You found Lupin's hideout?! So that thing we went to so much effort... to steal at Fujiko's behest is... not a piece of UFO that traveled millions of light-years. It's a specially forged alloy developed... by the U.S. Department of Defense. It's nothing romantic like we expected. Department of Defense? For defense purposes? Yeah. So, have you found anything, Jigen? Yeah. The tattoo on the chick who attacked me looked familiar, so I looked it up. I was attacked too. Yo, Goemon! That makes the story simple. Lupin, Goemon, come check this out. The Bloody Angels - they are Amazons of the modern era, an anti-American terrorist group consisting entirely of women. Amazons of the modern era, huh? They are professional hitmen who will take any... measures in order to threaten the United States. Lady Joe: A master of Jeet Kune Do. She really is a woman, but normally dresses and acts like a man. A cross-dressed fair lady, shall we say? Bomber Linda: A magician who is also... a master of firearms and explosives. She's the one who attacked me. Poison Sophie: She is... A master of poison. She acts as an insurance inspector, right? Hmm? She's the one who came after me. This is Kaoru the Ripper. She wields the ghostly sword, Benizakura. A master swordswoman. She's the one who attacked you, Goemon? A top secret special alloy, and the all-female... terrorist organization who's after that, huh? That's what I found. I see. I guess they want to sell it to enemy countries to get super rich. So, what now? I don't care if it's a national secret or... whatever, why don't we give it to them? It's not fun if they keep attacking us for something like that. Not so easy, Jigen. They won't let us off the hook just... because we give it to them, you know? I know. Lupin! You are now completely surrounded! Come out with the Original Metal! Come out! Man, I'd forgotten about Old Man! We will storm in if you don't come out on the count of three! One! Two! What now, Lupin? What should we do? Three! All right, I like your guts. Charge! Damn Lupin, giving us all this trouble! See what we can do?! Inspector, it's more important to secure... the Original Metal than to arrest Lupin! We can't go easy until we have it in our hands! I know that! Sir, Lupin and his gang are missing! Wh-What?! They should still be around. Go find them. Don't just stand there! Yes, sir! Where are you, Lupin?! Um, Inspector... What is it, Emily? Those three drove off in our armored personnel carrier... What?! Dammit! That was them! A pop quiz. How were they going to develop a new weapon using... an alloy that even the Zantetsu Sword can't cut? Let's think about this together. Huh? Oh yeah! If you can't cut or bend it, it's only a piece of metal trash! You need something else to work it with. Bingo! That's exactly it. I've found the armored personnel carrier! But Lupin and his gang aren't here! So, are you saying that Bloody Angels has that "something"? Yup. So we'll steal that from them, then make a... deal with the hostile nation in their place. That's what a great thief does! Hey, wait a minute... There's another person who used us. Oh, Fujiko, you mean? Lupin, I have a favor to ask of you. So, what is this something, Lupin? I have no clue. Huh?! How do we steal something we don't know anything about?! If we don't know, we'll ask. There's no way they'll let us go unchecked for long. Someone will come after us soon enough. Oh yeah. You again? The ghostly sword, Benizakura. Whoever wields it becomes uncontrollably... thirsty for blood like a hungry beast. It's a possessed sword. And the swordsmith, who forged such a monster unintentionally, has never forged another sword and became a sharpener, I've heard. That sword should not exist in this world. Promise me one thing: That you will destroy that sword! I promise. So, what kind of place is this deserted... island that Fujiko is using as her hideout? There used to be a small village of wheat farmers... There are only the ruins of the village and ancient ruins left. It's a small, deserted island now. You sure she'll be there? I have no idea. You really have a sense of urgency. What, you're gonna sleep? I'm starting to feel... Sleep well thanks to the sleeping gas. And I'll help you so you'll never wake up! Sorry, try again. You need to get a lot better at this. Why didn't the sleeping gas work? It's because of this. See this? It's a super high efficient air filter, the Mountain Breeze. Good manners for smokers, Ms. Poison Sophie of Bloody Angels. You knew from the beginning?! Yes, we knew from the beginning. We had questions we really wanted to ask you. Jigen! Damn! Jigen! Don't take me so lightly! How dare you poke fun at me! See this? I have a deadly poison in this bolt tip. You'll die no matter where it hits you! Don't make such a scary face. It ruins your beauty. I'm saying the way you talk pisses me off! Now, where is the real Original Metal? The real one? It's right here. So you had it. Hand that over if you don't want to die. What?! You can't kill me. If you could, you would have killed me by now. You could take the Original Metal from me after that. I told you to not take me so lightly. If you want to die that much, I'll grant your wish! Move out of the way, if you don't want to die. Hey, there must be something that... enables us to forge it any way we want. What is it? Who has it? Do you? I don't know what you're talking about. It's no use playing dumb with us. Hand it over. What?! Don't tell me... Yes, we do. We will make a deal with the hostile... nations in place of the Bloody Angels. We can't justify this job unless we make money that way. I'm not doing this for money. We put our lives on the line for our dream and for our ideals! Thieves like you will never understand! She couldn't help but blurt out the truth, huh? But that made one thing clear. They have that other thing for sure. That aside... look at that, Lupin. We have a monster on our tail. I found you, Lupin! Do you really think you can get away from me? Old Man! I'm amazed how far he goes. Listen up, Lupin! Turn yourself in on the count of three! Or I will shoot you down. One! You hear that? That's crazy! Two! Three! I like your guts. Fire! Huh?! No way! I can't believe it! Yay! Wait a minute! Original Metal could be blown to pieces if you do that! Don't worry. Lupin won't die that easily. Easily? Damn it, Old man! I'll get you back! Damn it! You're under arrest! You're right... All right! Spread a dragnet around the area! Around the area?! We're on an ocean! Then search the islands nearby! Use your brain. Y-Yes, sir! Hey, show it to me again. Yes, ma'am. It's so wonderful. I love it. I love the smell of new banknotes. I love the smell of Fujiko-chan. Ugh! Sea monsters! Who are you calling sea monsters? Who? What?! Now, can you tell me everything? What are you talking about? . How are you involved with the Bloody Angels? I don't know. Don't play dumb. They're the people you tried to sell the Original Metal to. I don't know who they are! It was a part of the deal. Please believe me, Lupin. Yes, I believe you. Idiot. I love you, Lupin. You are the only one who believes me. Hey! Anyway, you tricked us for this measly sum of money. That's not it! The rest of the money was supposed to be... in the car trunk, but it was empty, so... I was tricked too, Jigen. Sorry, you can't play that trick on me. Anyway, I'll keep this as a nuisance charge. Hey! That's my money! You're wrong, too. That's our money. Give it back to us! A party of Bloody Angels is here now. What's this, Lupin?! They're your client. Hand over the Original Metal for real this time, Lupin. I invited them to this island to finish... the whole thing once and for all. How could you get me involved in this?! Yeah, right. You're the one who got us involved. So anyway, Fujiko, can you play with them too? Fujiko, get your gun! Just kiddin'. What?! We're starting to run out of time, too. We'll kill you all this time. We won't hold back this time, Lupin. This way! Where are you aiming? Damn it! All my bullets... I won't let you run this time, Fujiko. You think so? Looks like that's as far as you go. Now, hand over that attaché case. No! My money! One shot left. I need to finish her with it, or I'll be in deep shit. Wheat? No, it's flour. Got you! A mirror?! It's magic! I tricked you good, huh? And you have no bullets left, right? You lose! You're such a sore loser. Give it up and come out! Now what? This is really bad. It's from then... Game's over, Jigen. Giving this... back to me... was a mistake! It's all over. If you can't use your strong arm, you can't use your magic. I still... have my left arm! It's a thermobaric explosion caused by sparks from... the gunfire igniting the flour saturating the air. What a careless end for an explosives expert. Lupin must be running upwind intentionally. I can't use poison gas this way. Damn! Where are you?! You lost again. You need to get much better at this. What do you want?! You want to brag about how good you are? That I'm always under your control? Stop mocking me! I'm not mocking you. Then... Then go ahead and kill me! Come on! Do it! I told you. I just want the other thing. I'm not after your life. Why do you want to make me feel so miserable? I've been thinking that I needed to finish the fight with you. Same here. I don't care about the Original Metal any more. I just... want to... slash you. N-No way... My Benizakura was... Yes. Drink... my blood... I wish I could have met you under different circumstances. My boyfriend was killed by friendly fire in a war the U.S. started. It wasn't an accident. They started the bombing, fully aware that... there were American soldiers left behind. That's why you joined the anti-American... terrorist group, the Bloody Angels? Lupin should be somewhere on this island for sure! Split up and search every inch of this island! Oh man, it's Old Man again. Ever since a UFO crashed at Roswell, there... have been many sightings of UFOs in the area. Rumor has it that America is conducting trade in... secret with the aliens, developing the UFO themselves. I've heard that. But that's a hoax that the CIA spread intentionally. They've been developing plasma weapons there. Plasma weapons? The ultimate weapon that shoots through any walls, and only kills the targets inside with an electromagnetic wave. The Original Metal is the specially forged alloy it absolutely needs. You made us steal it to stop that project? Lupin and the others are definitely somewhere on this island. Don't let them get away. Yes, sir! But you can't stop their project simply... by stealing such a small sample, can you? That's why we're selling it to the hostile nation. Are you telling me these enemies are developing the same weapon? It's already eighty percent complete. It's just that they need a sample of Original... Metal in order to reproduce the same material. That's really catch 22. That's the only way they have a chance against the U.S. And that's why there'll be more unfortunate girls like you. This country has become too powerful, so it's best to destroy everything at once. And... we'll build a country with our ideals on top of it! Stop that. Forget about the past already. You're so pretty, you know? You're never serious, are you? My boyfriend was like that too. Being with him made me think that all the... troubles I have aren't worth worrying about. Yeah, I'm really just happy-go-lucky. You know, I still haven't answered your question. About the other material needed to work on the Original Metal. I'm not interested in the plasma weapon, but I promised my dear woman that I'd make a ring with it. It's a special liquid containing lavender... fragrance that our boss carries around. Watch out, Lupin! Sophie! Sophie! Sophie! Lupin... I wish... I could have met... you sooner... Emily! What is it? Did you see Lupin? Lupin?! Did you shoot her? I meant it as an intimidation. But he pointed that gun at me, and... I got scared... You're under arrest, Lupin. Who's this woman? She's Poison Sophie, one of the Lucky Clovers in the Bloody Angels. She is? It was just getting better. Sir, I have confiscated the Original Metal. Good work. Come with us, Lupin. All right, we'll take him away. Walk briskly. What's this all about?! Y-You guys? That's as far as you go, Inspector Zenigata. Who are you?! Let's start the blood-soaked party. I'm one of the Lucky Clovers in the Bloody Angels, Lady Joe. What?! You're one of the Bloody Angels too?! Hand over the Original Metal to me. Wh-What? What in the... What's going on?! Looks like all your subordinates have... been swapped with Bloody Angels. What?! You girl, hand over the Original Metal if you want to live. Inspector, I think it's best to do what they say. OK! OK! I'll give you the Original Metal, so lower your guns! No, Emily! They'll kill us even if we hand it over. He's right. Let's run! Don't let them get away! Get them! Start a fire! Burn the whole place and cut them off! Come out! There's no use hiding! Damn them... It's me, Zenigata. What the heck's going on?! All the men have been swapped with Bloody Angels or whatever. Anyway, send backup right now! Promptly! Got that? Hey Old Man, I've been wondering for a while... What? Do you happen to like wearing perfume? What?! Stop talking crazy in this situation. I never wore any... You know, I got Emily's perfume on me accidentally. I see. That's why you smell good. Like lavender. You have no place to run, Lupin, Zenigata! If you don't want to die, make the... woman bring the Original Metal here! Inspector, I'll go. Inspector, please flee with Lupin while I go out. No! No means no! They'll kill you. They'll kill us even if we stay here! Then only I can... No! Don't worry. She won't be killed. What? Haven't you done enough, Emily? You're the boss of the Bloody Angels. What are you talking about? Stop making things up! You must have shot Sophie to silence... her, but you were a tad too late. I see it now. The special liquid needed to forge Original Metal is that perfume. You're making that up! Then give me that perfume. Fine. Check all you want. Hey now. Emily is the boss of the Bloody Angels? What are you talking about, Lupin? This klutz can't possibly be- Dodge it, Old Man! Emily? That's pretty good, Lupin. You caught on. Emily?! Emily... That's right. I'm the boss of the Bloody Angels, Spider Emily. Emily... Inspector Zenigata, thanks for all your care. Damn... It was hard to contain my laughter at how gullible you are. . But it's all over now. You're absolutely right, Lupin. This is the one and only liquid needed to work Original Metal. Don't make me laugh, you ham actor! Your act sucks ass! I couldn't contain my laughter, you hear?! Looks like you don't understand your situation. What?! Now that we have both the Original Metal... and the perfume, we don't need you. We'll kill you both now. Do it! Don't let them get away! Get them! Lupin! What the heck is this?! This island is full of above-ground ancient ruins everywhere. Ruins?! This is not good, Old Man. She was really useless. She kept slowing me down all the time. I wondered why such a brat was my partner. But eventually I started thinking of her like my own daughter. I was just starting to think that I'll... watch after her until she's fully trained. And she was the boss of the Bloody Angels. Such a foolish story. Ain't that funny? It's not funny at all. It's unforgivable. Absolutely unforgivable. Sophie! I wish... I could have met... you sooner... Old Man... Are you sure? Don't take it wrong. I'm not letting you go. This is purely to get us out of this situation. I know, Old Man. Here. Hey, Old Man! What? Come here! Right behind this... there's this. Let's go, Old Man. Don't order me around. Where did they hide? Find them! Find them and kill them! I'm over here! Lupin! I'm over here too! Fire! Kill them! Looks like you haven't gotten dull on your shooting, Old Man. Of course not. Don't take my experience from my Metropolitan Police days lightly! Stay alert, Lupin. Yes, sir. Hey Lupin, where is Emily? Over there. I won't let you take it! Got it! Hold it right there, Lupin, Zenigata! If you want her alive, hand over that liquid. I'm sorry, Lupin. I got caught. Now, hand it over. Lupin, please do as she says. Fujiko! What?! Good job. You saved me. You really are high-maintenance. Jigen! The new Zantetsu sword is different from before. Goemon! Jigen and Goemon... Have Linda and Kaoru been killed? What took you two so long? She wasn't easy to deal with. Same here. Kill them all together! Bloody Angels, lay down your weapons and surrender. They made it. I was so close to our dream. Now, I must start over. I cut another worthless object. Hey, Boss. Shit... Emily. Looks like it's time you gave up, too. W-Wait a minute! Let's make a deal like a real business. You can fetch yourself a huge sum of money when you have both this Original Metal and the liquid. So let's be partners. You can keep half of the take. So? It's not a bad deal, is it? I see. That doesn't sound too bad. Doesn't it? Then we have a deal? But... only if what you have is the real thing. Look behind you. I had the real thing. Lupin, I have a favor to ask of you. Can you let me borrow the Original Metal? I needed a honing stone that's harder than the sword itself to sharpen the damaged Zantetsu sword. As you can see, we have both the Original Metal and the liquid. Wait! I'll give you as much money as you want. It's enough that you can live off of it for the rest of your life. Money is all that matters to you? Poor woman. Wait, Lupin! I can explain! You've taken away so many things from me so I can't forgive you. Please, Lupin. Please spare my life. Right. Killing you will only make my Walther dirtier, nothing more. Forget it. Thank you, Lupin. Now, get lost before I change my mind. Damn fool, Lupin! I told you to get lost before I changed my mind. Emily... Inspector! Inspector! Inspector! Inspector, we can't find the Original Metal that Emily had! Idiot! Search more thoroughly! Yes, sir! But the current around here is fast so... Maybe it got washed out to sea... Then search along the current! Quit whining, and find it with whatever... it takes, with submarine or sonar! Use your brain! Yes, sir! Um... If you'll excuse me, sir. Hold it. Blow your nose first. But this handkerchief... Thank you very much! Um... I'll do my best! Go. Yes, sir! So, the Original Metal is deep under the sea... I'm sure Old Man is trying hard to find it. There it is! I found it, Inspector! What?! Good job! Remember, handle with care. Carefully... I'm done for! Damn Lupin! What a bummer. I could get super rich if I could sell it. That's so cruel, Fujiko. You were after the money, not a ring from me. Why doesn't Lupin tell Fujiko the truth? Maybe he's tired of women who are only after money? Stop your pouting, Lupin. I want a ring too! Can you buy me one? Sure! I'll buy you one for a kiss! He hasn't learned his lesson at all. Lupin! I told you I wasn't letting you go. Oh? You didn't? Besides, you had me go after a fake one again! Where's the real Original Metal?! Huh? He didn't tell me about it! Wh-Wh-What are you talking about? Lupin! Are you hiding something from me again?! Tell me! Hey now! Help, Jigen-chan, Goemon-chan! Hell no. Same here. One thing's for sure... Lupin never... intended to sell it to a hostile nation.
