I don't believe it, we should've been there an hour ago! An hour ago! Why bypass like that? Move on already! People here drive like 80 year old! I don't understand how come we didn't wake up? Why? You didn't set the alarm for 6:00 that's why! Sure I did. I think... I can't believe it, why do we have to be late today of all days! I guess it's because I slept upside down. - What? I'm reading this new book by Osho. Who? - Osho, the guru, Osho. Never mind. Anyway, he says sleeping like that helps your sex drive. Osho? Come on! Osho? Nuts! I knew we couldn't count on you to wake us up in time. I knew it! Don't worry, we'll get the bonus. - What bonus? He'll kill us! He won't! -He will! 'Because you can't tell the difference between 6 and 9, counting on a fucking guru... To organize your life because you can't do it yourself... You saying' it's my fault? - No, 'of course not, it's my fault... As long as you take responsibility it's fine with me. What? No! Of course its you're fault! You're supposed to wake us up, no?! - Be Careful! There is no way that after three months of never being late... We pick bonus day to be the day we come in late. He'll keep his word. You got to cool it, 'bro. It's all how you take things in life. Take three deep breaths and imagine you're in a cave... Move already! How long it takes to cross the street!? Go on, already! For example, see this bottle? There is this campaign; with a million shekels prize. If we'll believe this bottle cap is the lucky winner? It will be the winner. What campaign? What are you blabbing about? Pay attention, we don't need any bonus. We're going to win a million shekels and it's going to be an historic day. I had plans for this bonus! 3, 2, 1... - I don't believe it. What are you doing? What are you doing? What is it? Are you nuts? My eyes! Are you nuts?! What the... -Watch it! These two in the picture are Ilan Kovach and Lior Duvdevani. Hello, it's regarding the job. Pilot license? Yeah, yeah, yes. - No. We don't have one. Two 30 year-old friends in a struggle to survive every day. Battling the monster also known as 'reality'. Let's go back a few years when it all started. Ilan Kovach was a shy kid and an outcast, who liked to eat...everything. Although he was an outcast, Ilan Kovach fell in love with the prettiest girl in class: Anat Bleicher Young Kovach decided to take initiative and to fearlessly follow his heart. Which tumed out to be a big mistake. But then a weaker link entered the class. -Hello. This is our new student What's your name, honey? Lior Duvdevani the kid was better known as: ""Duvdevani the flying kite"", I'm here, I'm here! Or ""Duvdevani the wiener"". - Give to me! Give it to me! Or the kid who always got screwed. Are you ready to tell the class your name? Lucky for him, in his new class he didn't yet have a nickname. From that moment, the two of them became inseparable. The first thing they did together was break into the school safe and steal money to buy a present for the girl that Kovach was in love with... 8 kg of vanilla-mocha ice cream. It didn't work. But instead of winning the heart of Anat Bleicher they spent the entire year cleaning out the school garbage. During that very period is when they decided to never part ways And that they will leverage their childhood trauma. In order to get as high as they can on the social ladder. That also didn't work. WHAT CAN HAPPEN?! Great day, huh? - I don't understand why we didn't win. 'Moming. Whose car is this? The car... - It's ours. It's parked in the handicapped zone. Serious violation. Oh, no, no, no. We didn't park... A red Punto... without a handicap sticker... parked a foot onto the sidewalk... Wait, we didn't park it, we had an accident, we hit a pole. Is it parked in a handicap zone? - Yes. It's stationary and no one's inside? - Yes. Are you handicapped, god forbid? - No. Will you shut up, already? Conclusion: the car is parked illegally. But it's an accident, we didn't park here. Aren't you listening? Do us a favor, don't be such a maniac. What did you say? I said don't be a... manmaniam...malaria.... Spartan...don't be a... I think didn't hear you very well, what was it you said? He said you are a maniac Thank you. Insulting a public servant; anything else you want to say? I've got 400 reports to fill out. Sorry, Mr. Inspector I apologize for our behavior, we didn't mean to offend you. We're just two guys with the best of intentions. Who hit a disability parking pole. Sometime things like that happened. Be a buddy, be a good guy, buddy, boy, 'bro, eh? Mr. Inspector? - Yeah, yeah, sure. I'm not your 'bro... and not your buddy... Listen, we just... You just forget I can decide what to do with twerps like you. Your type thinks they can do anything; hit a pole whenever they want! I don't like the way you talk to a public servant. Boom! 100 shekels. I don't like your haircut. Boom! Endangering pedestrians, 200! You offer 300? Attempted bribery: 400 shekels! See how it works? - Yes sir, Mr. Inspector. Have a nice day and thank you for choosing Franko. What can I say; one of the best days we've ever had, ever. We are doomed, we can forget about the bonus and the job. Don't worry, he's a good man. I'm sure he'll understand and forgive us. I wish... let's go. Two hours and forty three minutes late! Benny, we're really, really sorry. And I'll tell you something else: There's nobody happier than us two comin' to work for you every day. Every single pool we clean out, we feel part of a family: ""Benny Pool Cleaning & Maintenance"". Benny, Ben-Ben boy. Benjamin, Benchick, Benny, Benini, Benito. Bonita... Listen and listen good! You should be thankfull I let you two zeros into a place like this. Thanks. - Not now! In an hour and a half the owner is coming back. You lick this place clean; the whole pool area, you dig? Otherwise, I'll rip your balls off. Get it?! One ball at a time, I'll grab 'em, and pull 'em off with my hands!! And you'll scream: ""I ain't got no balls no more!"" Benny, you can rest assured; not only will the pool be clean, and the owner happy, we will justify entirely the annual bonus we get. If we're good workers, it's worthwhile giving us a bonus. What bonus, this? - Yes! You didn't win a prize. You didn't win a prize. Don't you think you're a bit obsessive with all these caps? No. You didn't win a prize. That's enough, don't you think? At least I do something to improve our economic situation. Is that right? I do something to improve our economic situation. Like what? - What "what"? I... Look, I go over the bills to see where we can cut down. Yipee, and what's your conclusion? - There's nowhere to cut down. 300 shekels for your gym. Can't cut that. You don't think it's a bit of a waste? Absolutely not. It's a matter of health. It's not a luxury. Can't cut the gym. But you don't even go! I will go. I'll go tomorrow. Besides, that's the situation and we have to accept it. Like your ""Osho"" says, right? ""Kabbala is the key to change..."" No, Osho says everything in life happens for a reason. -Same shit. I think the reason we are in this mess, is that somebody... I won't say who... did something really stupid. Let me get this straight; you say it's my fault, we're in this mass? Simply Unbelievable. We working our asses off for minimum wage, work our asses off for him and he cuts our bonus. And because of your Osho, I didn't even get to have my moming coffee. I bet they got coffee made of gold. Wow, look at that! Whoa! Amazing! What're you doing? You see? That's life for you! A fuckin' mansion, fuckin' royal sofa, fuckin' luxury flooring, that costs as much as your car. Fuckin... -Can you please go? We're not supposed to be in here! They even have a fucking Shih Tzu dog - What are you do... See how good I look with a Shih Tzu? Hey, doggie, wanna be Kovach's Shih Tzu? Yes, He said 'yes'. No, he said, please, you weirdo, leave me alone and get out before my owner and your boss come back and tear your nuts off. Just like he promised! You see? That's your problem; you're a coward. You do only what people tell you instead of taking initiative. Loosen up, man! What could happen? Are they cleaning the pool right now? - Shit, shit. I told you he'd be coming! - Benny, Benny, take him! What're you doing? - Run, run! Quick! Come on, already! Faster, faster! Why'd you bring him? I dunno, he just came with me. ""He Just came with you?"" How does a dog just ""comes""? Give him to me. Shit, shit, hide it... What's going on here? Were you inside the house? What? - What? -No. What was that? That's Poopsy, my dog. - What? Poopsy, poopsy, come to mommy. Poopsy, where are you? Poopsy... - Poopsy? Over there. Listen, and listen good. You can go and tell your guru to shove his face into a Buddhist elephant's ass 'cause none of this is my fault. What it's better to sit all day and do nothin' and look at caps. ""Oh, maybe I won!"" ""I didn't win...oh, maybe I won..."" You're sayin' it's my fault? - Yes! You know what? Its your fault, Avi's fault, Osho's fault, everybody's fault, Ok? Except you, huh? I made a big mistake, I hoped for something. I shouldn't have hoped for nothing in this world. It's a new approach. Like Buddhism, but the opposite. It's Kovachism. - That's it. You didn't win. Aren't you sick off it that life keeps crapping on us daily? I wish, just for one day I could take a crap on life itself. Know what I mean? - No. "No?" What do you mean "No?" Take this pillow, ok? Say it's 'Life"", ok? I'd like to smash it. Like this: Smash childhood, adolescence, smash every stage in my life. Rip this life apart like it ripped me apart; smash it. Smash, smash, smash! I've had it, I've had it! You won the million shekel cap! Congratulations! You're a millionaire! Its real What's its say on the application? You have to bring the winning cap to their offices between 9:00 to 17:00 to claim the prize... Wow, the game's on till tomorrow. I don't believe it. I won the fuckin' million! We won the 'fuckin' million! Yeah, we won. - Ok, ok, what do we do now? Nothing. - What? You don't have to do anything. Just wait till moming. And just go to their office to get the check and that's all. Ok, and...? Nothing, 'bro, it's the first time we don't have to do a thing, get it? No. - Right? -Yup. -Wow... Ok, here's what we do... I'll stay here and guard the cap and you go to sleep. -Great. Wait, why don't I watch the cap and you go to sleep? Better I watch it; I'm more reliable. You sleep... No, no. I'm reliable, too. I can watch over the cap. You'll go to bed. -I know what I'm saying. Let me watch the cap. You go to sleep. It's fine. I know what I'm sayin', I want to stay up. Ok, so we'll both stay awake! - Agreed. What happened? Where's the cap? Where is it? -Why'd we fall asleep? - I told you you'd fall asleep! Where's the cap? - Here it is, here! Oh, thank god. Everything is all right. What time is it? We got 10 more hours. - Good, let's go to the supermarket. Shit. That guy over there is looking at us funny, like he's going to jump us. He's nine years old, the kid. If he attacks us, you get his attention and I'll give him the ""Hungarian Peacock"". What's the ""Hungarian Peacock""? A judo hold I learned in tenth grade. You stand erect, spread your wings... Hey, hey, cut it out. If you show you're under pressure it'll make people look at you. Just act normal. Great. - Thanks. I'm just sayin' that if somebody attacks I'll give 'em the ""Hungarian Peacock"". Can you make it a little faster? We're really pressed for time. Good evening, Mr. Attias. what are we going to do with you? You again? Enough, Franko, get off my back, let me work. Shit! What? - It's that inspector. The guy who gave us the fines after the accident. So? Don't start drivin' me nuts, now will you? Shit, shit, I told you we shouldn't have left the apartment. I told you. He's after the cap. He don't know anything about it. - Yes he does! How's he know? He's Alladin? Will you relax?! Get off my back, it's enough. - What am i going to do with you? You were here at noon already. Enough! What should i do with you? - Forget it, come on. To the office. Yuck! Hey, careful on the mayonnaise. He's gone, he left. Relax. - All right. Franko, you can't do this to me. You gave me a ticket today, you gave me one yesterday. Stop! I told you I'll take care of it! - The law says if you don't have a building permit, it must come down immediately, And that means right now, not... not tomorrow. - There's no way, Franko, It's concrete, concrete. It'll take time. ""You can't do this to me... ""You can't do this to me"" ""You're ruining my livelihood"" Franko, don't be a maniac. What'd you say? What did you call me? Listen, Franko, is there some way we can take care of this? You trying to bribe me? A public servant in uniform? That's a felony. I only said maybe there's something legal we can do between us... are you whining like a chihuahua? Or are you going take out a few, and hand it over... Enjoy the rest of your evening, and thank you for choosing Franko. Wet wipes, please. Wet wipes now? No need, no need... I don't know if there are any left, but... Move, move. No, there's no need. Really, no need. Can you tell me why it's so important just now? Right now, wet wipes? We don't have any and we're here, so why not? Listen, listen. See this? - So? We got a million shekels. When's the last time you had a fuckin' million in your pocket? I don't believe it. There is not one person in the world who wouldn't trade places with us. The cashier, the customers, that maniac inspector... To keep it with us, keep your mouth shut. Thanks. Everything's ok. - He saw us. Walk fast, don't look back. - He saw us. He didn't see, everything's all right. He saw, he knows. I told you not to leave the house, didn't I? Yeah, yeah, come on before you cause a tsunami here. Good evening. It appears to me that you hold a certain cap of great value. A cap? According to city ordinance A7521, I, Assistant Inspector Shalom Franko, declare this cap to be the property of the state. Mr. Inspector, we have no idea what you are talking about. And by the power vested in me, as the only one in uniform here, I must ask you to hand me the cap. Otherwise I will be obliged to use the lawful authority at my disposal. Be quiet. Let's be logical for a moment, everything is fi... Run! Here we go... Shit. What do we do? What? Let's go to Elvis. - Who? Elvis. - What's Elvis got to do with it? Only he can help us in cases like this. The last thing we need on our heads right now is Elvis! So then let me do the ""Hungarian Peacock"". Stop it already with the ""Hungarian Peacock"". We have to think of where we can hide the cap! I'll count to five... Then you come out, you give me the friggin' cap and go back to your mangy lives. Hide, hide, stay next to me! One... Two... Keep quiet, don't move! - Three... Four... Focus, focus! - Five... Six, come on my little teddy bears, nothing can save you... seven... Eight... Nine... Now we come to ten... When we get to ten, that's when you need to be scared. Wow! You won't believe what just happened. - I know what to do. What're you... What are you doing? You swallowed the cap? Are you nuts? What are you doing? What's wrong? He swallowed lots of pills. I found him on the floor with a suicide note beside him... That's it. Now we have to pump out his stomach... What pills did you take? What pills did you take? Bilotovenide... I can't make out what he's sayin'. Clitanovidealon... What? Throat lozenges. Ok, ok. They'll examine you with a pump for a gastroscopy. What? - Good, good. Not a good idea, l...l have a phobia of probing devices... When l was in tenth grade l thought l had hemorrhoids and they did numerous tests, and found l sat on a tack. Great. l'll be outside, you... - Don't leave... lt's ok. Get them out of him... Ok, undress and lie on your stomach. All right, now... l'm Dr. Bleicher, l'm here to talk about your daughter... Anat Bleicher? The operation took longer than usual. We did all we could but... there were complications. l'm sorry, but she died a few minutes ago. How can that be? l know how hard it is, but it happens. Complications. lf you need to speak to someone... She only twisted her ankle! Aren't you the Hudayev family? No, we're the Friedmans! Ah, so your daughter didn't die, she has a sprain. Oops. Hey, Anat, it's me, llan Kovach. Remember me, grade 4B? Anat, it's me, llan Kovach. Remember me, grade 4B? Excuse me? - Yes? Hi... Aloha. Hi, uh... Hi, Ana... - What? l am so... l'm 4B... Dr. Bleicher. Yes, just a moment, sir. - l want you to look at my file, something isn't right, l examined this patient. Here's what they saw, and now it looks different. l'll be here a few minutes... Kovach. l just can't, what a loser. Stammer like some... What's going on? Where is he? l have no other way to explain this to you. My friend is in there now, for a gastropocy, gastocracy, gastroscopy, whatever it's called, l went out for a minute, and came back in to be with him. Visiting hours are over. This is a closed wing. Only patients, and you're not. l understand. l'm with him. l went out for just a minute, and came back in to be with him. Sorry, you're not the patient. - l know l'm not a patient.

Hello, doctor. Listen, we fudged a little bit about the situation... Don't worry. lt's a very simple procedure. We insert this tube in your mouth down into the stomach and we take out the object with these sharp little knives. Easy. Open up. l can't, l've got a probing phobia. Would you prefer that we go through the anus? Listen, bud, l'm here 23 hours with no sleep. l'm dead. lf you don't want this in your eye or up your nose, lie quietly and let me work. Dig? Hello. -Wait, sir. Ma'am, you must calm down. Your screaming like a banshee won't stop your husband's bleeding. l understand, l know what amputating a finger is. And l know that your screaming won't re-attach it. You know what helps me calm down? Muesli. Make yourself some Muesli while waiting for the ambulance. Start eating and that will calm you down. Hello, l got hurt in an accident. Yes, write this down: 2 cups of oatmeal... yes. 50 grams of pumpkin seed. Madam, l need a doctor here! Sir, you will have to wait like everybody. Do l look like ""Everybody""? l am a uniformed official hurt on duty! You mix all the ingredients together with the granola, except the apricots and the cranberries. Yes, l once mixed them in, and it tumed out horrible. Why'd you swallow it, anyway? All right, we're done. lt wasn't too bad, now was it? Ok, stitch him up, l'm going to sleep for a year.

He can hear. - Fuck, he's here! 533, going out. Half hour late, but going. Lior Duvdevani, 10 Luria Street. The mountain comes to Mohammed and bops him on the head. You don't know what l will do to you... The moment he stops, we'll tell him there's a mistake, we're not paramedics and we break for home. But l was a medic in the army. - What? Who cares if you... You were 2 weeks in training, and then out as a mental case. Still, l had enough training to take care of... Hello, hello, hello... Houston... what the fuck. Who cares if you were a medic? lt don't matter, nobody cares! We're breakin' for home. - All right. Here at the center, incident 372, get it done, we're outta here in 10 minutes. There was a little mistake here, see... All units, attention, security reports two young men who apparently have stolen equipment from the hospital. One tall & swarthy, the other, skinny... - Ah, 372, 372... Ok, we're taking the suitcase to treat 372 and we're trained on how to do it. We're always on 372. Come on lets go. Go Somebody here call an ambulance? Yes, yes, look. What's this, what's going on here? Get it out, already! Sir, how'd you wind up like this? Ask Gandolf! Who? Me! l'm Gandolf. We're on chapter 175, the fire slopes on Mt. Mordor. Saroman and Frodo are fighting over who holds the crystal ball. Huh? Last week it was Saroman who held it the longest. And now it's Frodo's turn. lt's so not true l didn't have it all the time, Lots of other people held the crystal ball. Smeagol, Bilbo, Bugins, and Varagon. - l didn't touch it! Not true! When did l have it? Not even for a second. That egoist had it the whole time. What crystal ball? What are you talking about? Frodo grabbed it from Saroman, so Saroman called him a fat gnome. That's because he called me a man-loving magician. But you are a man-lover. l am not a man-lover! Yes you are. l myself saw you love many men. -l am not. Lots and lots of men... Excuse me, can someone get this stick outta me? Then Saroman called him a bald gnome. Frodo got insulted and threw the ring out the window. ln response, Saroman got hold of the magic wand, shoved it up Frodo's ass, so now Frodo is injured and we can't go on with the game because we don't have the ring. Not true! l didn't throw the ring, Saroman the homo put a spell on me! Shut up, you bald gnome. - You shut up, you fart factory! Why are you always fighting? Precious... my precious. Will you stop it?! Can you explain this to me? Role play, R-D-N-D. - Huh? Role playing, looks like from ""Lord of the Rings"". You go out on an adventure and feel you're part of the story! Ok, fine, let's get outta here. He needs help, won't we help him? l don't care about the stick up his ass. All l want is to be outta here. And all l want is to help a man in distress. Silence, you fools! Can you kindly help us, dear humanoids? Sure, we're medics, aren't we? - No! Come. Breathe, breathe into the pain. Good, now relax, l will get it out. What are you doing here, anyway? Tonight we're at the chapter where we destroy Nimroder's chest of spells. Here, this one. Bro, that's a printer. lt was a printer, but Galdriel tumed it into a chest of spells. Last week we had to destroy the sword of Aragoran the Andoril. There, there, look. Bro, that's a lamp... Ok, great. Relax... Excellent, medic, great. Everything's fine, it's just a post-traumatic reaction, don't worry. Who's got some Vaseline? l do! Excellent. What, now you want Vaseline? Geez, the same story every time... That's it. Just a little bit more of the magic wand's in there, but don't worry, you'll shit it out. l really want to thank you, l hope that one day we will succeed in restoring our faith in humankind. Yeah, whatever. Come on, let's go. Thank you very much. Thank you. - Good evening, and be blessed. My precious... lt's the new ring, let's continue our joumey! lt's the cap, bro. Look, fools, the evil mortal succeeded in craftily getting back the ring! Hoorah, shire people! - Hoorah, hoorah! Hello, hello, hello... No game, no ring, no precious, no nothing. That's mine, give it to me, thanks. Not so fast, my friends. lf you want the ring so badly, you have to pass all the fellowships of the ring. We're not playing this nonsense game. This thing has nothing to do with your perverse bullshit. Tell that gnome to give it to me right away! Wait. Fellowship gathering? Let's see: if we go by the rules of Mordor, it's clear that... Yes, but according to the rules of... - lt's allowed! lt would never be allowed in the shire. Well, friends, we discussed it, and we have news for you... Good news! By the rules of Mordor, you can fight for the right to wear the ring! Smeagol will instruct you. The rules go like this: You can choose the race you wish to belong to, Troll, gnome, elf, or Nazgul, and the financial resources you have at your disposal. You're a hunk, you're a hunk. Excuse me? - You're a hunk. Lior Duvdevani, where does he live? Yes? He lives at... at... Schnorrer, that's enough, off! Can't you see she's not in heat? Poor thing... He's hungry, homy, and blind in one eye. Look. Look how handsome Schnorrer is. Some people say from some angles he looks like Begin. What do you say? That l don't care about that cat. Where's that Lior...? -Oh, yeah? What? - Just so you know... Right this second, you really hurt Schnorrer's feelings. Come on, sweeties, let's go. - No, no, sorry, l apologize. Can you help me? l have to find out where he lives. You're going to have to apologize to Schnorrer. What? - You heard me. Come on, Schnorrer is waiting. l apologize, Schnorrer, for what l said before. That was just mechanical, no feeling in it. l am sorry, Schnorrer, for what l said to you. And...? And l will never do it again. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Your cat majesty on high. Now shake hands. Great. Look in his eyes and say "meow"... Huh? What can l tell ya, you're a genius. Great idea, to be medics. Albert Einstein couldn't have thought of a better idea himself. Excuse me, but it was your idea. Yes, but l was planning to quit after a second, so we didn't... Shit! How did he know where we live? Shit, l can't find my wallet! He doesn't understand Hebrew, just say an apologetic ""meow"". Meow. A little less aggressive. We can't go back to the apartment, we've got to find a place to hide. So let's go to Elvis. No Elvis! Don't you get it? lf we go to him, we'll end up owing him a million shekels! Come on, l know you can do better. Right, Schnorrer? Look at him. Meow. Too apathetic... He can sense it. Meow, meow, meow, meow... Where does Lior Duvduvani live?! Don't know, l'm not from this area. Let's go hide at Micha, my cousin. Of all the people in the universe, Micha's the best you can do? You know anyone else who lives down the block, who is a relative, and can hide us all night? And can protect us with judo, ninjitsu, jujitsu, and... and web development? Oh, Lord, what's up with you today? Hana Senesh is all o ver my case today. Unemployment and the establishment mean shit to me. And you grind my head with the jumpin' parachutist!

That cap's your new lease on life and all these people here, the wannabes, the nobodies, will be stuck with their lackluster lives, in the... Fuck! Then comes the bill, and he says: ""Let's make it 50-50"" -What? You believe it? - Hey girls, what's bangin'? Major turn-off. - Of course. -ln a second. llan Kovach, nice to meet you. But he was such a hunk, it sucks... - Hunks are like that... Wanna beer? On me? He kind of looks like the guy you used to date. Remember, tall...? - Yeah, but you know... You know what, l think you need a mechanic cause l detect your radiator's heating up. Nice to meet you. llan Kovach. Nice set of pomelos... You like fresh squeezed, or from the container? Can l just punch him in the face and be done with him? Don't forget, we're guests here. Besides, you promised you'd stop knocking guys teeth out. Maybe l'll punch him in the nose or break his finger? Babe, it'd be a shame to break your nice nails on this ugly baboon. Look at him. -Hello, l'm here, l might just be able to hear you. Besides, we said we'd be nice. l'm not letting you ruin our chances to bag a rich husband. Unless you want to keep coming to crap parties after we're thirty. Rich husband? These guys are all drunken baboons like him! For sure. - Rich husband, you said? A million shekels right here. Wow. Careful he won't bite... Where were we...? Tell me, what say we split this joint and go someplace cozy? What do ya say, Jennifer? Sure, Emily! We'll give you some action ya never knew existed. -Yeah? l'd like that, but l have to stay here. You sure? - You have to? Yeah. - Maybe think about it a minute? No, l can't, no chance. - Think... No chance. -Take a sec. -Sometimes a man must be true to himself... Meet Jennifer and Amalia. - Emily. Emily and Amalia. - Jennifer. Jennifer, Emily, and Amalia. - Nice evening. And we're with them for... You know, going with the flow. - What's that in your eye? They offered that... we go party somewhere else. So we're going with them. Bro, what's with your eye? You should have that looked at. Wow, where are we? This is a magic forest. Anything can happen here. So, you... are driving the car, huh? lt drives really smooth, and... mechanical. You know l got a nipple ring? Great. Wonderful. Want to touch? Yeah... nice. Speaking of nipples, my Aunt Esther had breast cancer once. But she was cured. She had a breast removal so she's alive. With one breast, but alive. She's the greatest, my Aunt Esther. She makes great Passover puff pastries. You don't taste the matzah. OK. - The Magic forest. -We're here. We thought maybe we'd start with a little game. Sure, sure, any game you like. ""Monopoly"" or ""Yield"". ""Yield"" is a great game, ""Yield""! No, it's more a mix of ""Blind Cow"", ""Hide&Seek"", and ""Treasure Hunt"". l played it a lot in the army. ""Yield""! Great, but now we're gonna play the girls' game. All right, but ""Yield"" after, ok? Yeah, after. - ""Yield""... -Great, we got it. Love that ""Yield"" game! ""Yield""! - Stop already with the ""Yield"". ""Yield..."" What's the game? You're so sexy like that. Here it comes... We're getting' undressed... Ready for a once in a lifetime thrill? Sure, a thrill. -A trip. - We're hot and ready. Ready? - Wow, l can't wait... Here we go, wait, l'm naked already... - Whoa, l'm shaking... Oh, l want it, already. - l really can't believe l'm doing this. Here we go... Girls? Girls? - ""Yield""... Girls? Where are they, bro? Hey, girls? Where are you? - The cap! The cap, the cap! - Where is it? No!!! Unbelievable. Fuckin' million shekels! Why'd we leave the apartment? The cap is gone, and look where the hell we are! Anat Bleicher, too. -Who? Anat Bleicher from grade school, she was in the ER. l went over to her, and we almost spoke. Anat Bleicher from 4B? - Yeah. The pretty one you liked? - Yeah, that one... The one you tried to hit on when Eldad was her boyfriend and to punish you he stuck your head in the toilet and for 6 months nobody came near you 'cause you stunk like shit? - Yes, her! Ok? Her! Where's that coming from? Come here, come here a minute. What is it? Those ding-a-lings, bro. What're they doin' here? Look, they got the girls. They took our cap and now they're tied to a tree at night. lt's Karma. Men of the Fellowship of the Ring, our mission is nearing its end! Hark, Members of the Shire! - Not now, asshole. We stand here, at the foot of Mt. Gezira to cast the terrible ring into the fire and to save middle-earth from the evils of Sauron! Now. Hark, Members of the Shire! - Hoorah, hoorah, hoorah! Bro, that ugly guy's got the cap. We're going to take it back. What? l'm not going near that bunch of psychopaths! Don't you think we had enough near-death adventures tonight? l think we need to make a mature, responsible decision. To finish this story once and for all... The total disregard from what l think. Ok, ok, ok, let's think a minute. Forget it, l'm not going in there! We either call Micha here, or we go to Elvis. What's with this Elvis? Huh? You don't give up. Enough with Elvis! We're not going to Elvis! No more Elvis! Bro, look how scary they are, man. Are you really ready to give up on your million? lt's not a disgrace to give up. l guess it wasn't meant to be. -Give me a break. Let's accept the fact that we just can't defeat them. Not even with that ""Hungarian Peacock""? That only works in built up areas and we're in a forest. Look, l'm going to get the cap, you do whatever you want. Come on, answer, answer the phone, Micha. Hello... - cousin, lucky you answered. You won't believe where we are; we left with girls from your party and they took us to this forest... You fell for it, boyo, this is my voicemail, not me, bitches! l'm busy with my wiki-wik, so leave a message after the beep. Beep! Cousin, listen, you won't believe where we are, we're in the forest, west entrance. You gotta come get us out! We're in deep shit here! Gotcha again, boyo, that wasn't the beep, it was me, boyo! Beep! l'm a fuckin' human rhythm box! Beep! - Cousin, listen, you won't believe where we are. We left with the girls from your party and they took us to... Gotcha a 3rd time, mother fuckers. Now for the real beep. - Oh boy... Beep. Hi, cousin, listen... Come on, l got a great idea. Come on! ln the name of Ailbotor King of the House of Galadriel l call on the four winds of the skies. East, west, to save the poor shire people who... that, to be honest, don't have it easy. To be a peasant in our day... - Victor! Victor! - What? -Victor! This thing you do is a most serious thing! What the fuck? You mustn't burn the million shekel cap! Ah, the magic ring... What's happening? - They're not buying it, abort, abort! What do you mean "abort"? Bow to Balshazar, demon of the north! Who? Bow down, dumbbell, it's Balshazar, demon of the north! l guess its Michel, he plays Balshazar on Wednesdays. Right, when they do Harry Potter. Victor plays the leader, looks like there was a cross here. So even there Victor's the boss, huh? Michel, good for you, man. Heard you bought the outfit at eBay. Hush! Bow down, jerk! lt's Balshazar. Show some respect! lt's working, they're listening. What do l do now? Tell them to give you the ring, l mean, the cap, the ring... Hear me, dark spirits. Put the ring in my hand. Smeagol, give him the ring. lt is our ""precious"", let him go find his own. Come on, give him the ring, or l break you in a 1000 coils. Now, the ring! Aren't you sick of Victor? Don't you have any self-respect? You keep threatening us! Yeah, the game went to his head. He even goes home in costume. He goes to bed with his wife wearing it, takes the kid... ln the name of the spirit of Agadir! Smeagol, the ring! Now! Do my bidding, you wretched creature! You too, fatso! Come on, already! We will discuss it later, you let me down. You'll never pass this stage. Give it to him. What's going on? l can't see. He brought the cap, but l can't reach it; you get it. l'm holding you! Tell him to give it to you. Listen to me, you! My arms aren't long enough... Hand me the ring. - The hell with you. Give it to me as if... Bro, l got the cap. Let's move! - Good, good! l'll start backing up easy and you stay in character. And so, dear ladies, l must part, there are things to take care of... in the lower depths. Do not budge; your lives will be forfeit, you villains! Victor, you sure that's Balshazar? - Dunno. Michel, that you, precious? lt is l, Victor, Harry Potter night. Bro, they're getting closer. Retreat... Wait, l'm stuck on some... Michel? Ow, my ear! You're rubbin' my ear! You're pullin' me, pullin' me! You're pulling me! What's happening, guys? Hooray, the shire folk! Run, they're nuts! Stop, you bastards! Stop! - What are you doing? -lt's Micha's car. How do you know? - By the headlights. That's not Micha! - lt's him! We have to hide! - l'm telling you, it's him! -Move! Yo, bitches, you rang the ring-ring? Ah, it is Micha. Cousin! - Come on. You're in the shit? No fuckin' way! ""Lord of the Rings"", cousin? Yeah, cousin, with torches and all, and they tied the girls to a tree. You won't believe what went on back there. - Wait... You picked up those chuchos at the bar? No way! You messed with their hoods? Brought them to the highs? You burnt their subwoofer? You got their bini-bini-boo? No... -You burnt their Snoop-doggy-dogg? No, don't ask, cousin. They just wanted our cap. Shut up! -What cap? -l got the million shekel cap for RC cola. NO! - No way, Jose. You really got the cap? - No, No. He didn't find any cap. Go. - What? Fuckin' kill me, cousin, shoot my balls and call me ""flamingo""! Micha, listen to me, nobody can know about it. There are about 700 dudes after us trying to get the cap. Micha, cuz, you gotta take us home. Home? Let's go party! - No party, and not home, either. There's a psychopath in uniform after us, . Home's not safe. Besides, l'm dead tired. l gotta sleep a couple hours. We gotta find someplace they won't find us. l know! Let's go to... - Not Elvis again! You say Elvis again, l dunno what l'll do to you. Let's go to... Elvis. -You don't understand me? We're not going to Elvis. Who's Elvis? - But only Elvis can help us now. Who's Elvis? -How many times do l have to tell you? No Elvis! Elvis can help us. - Who's Elvis? We're not going to Elvis. l won't say it again! ""Elvis Exhauts"" Excuse me, who is Elvis? Over there. Come on, Benny, put a ten spot on him. He's a killer. Count on Elvis. Who, Borisov? Rico'll eat him for breakfast. Come on, close it out, it's a sure bet, do it, 'bye. How much to put down for you? Are you Elvis? Who wants to know? A friend of Duvdevani. Don't know him. Duvdevani. l need to get him and his friend Kovach, right away. Sorry, don't know them. That's not quite true; l do know them. From way back when l was in vending and they were nobodys. ""Elvis Lickings"" Eight liters of vanilla-mocha. What for? Kovach is nuts about the prettiest girl in the world: Anat Bleicher. He doesn't have a chance, right? - Not a chance. Who asked you? You got 8 liters of ice cream, or not? 2000 shekels plus tax. ln cash, no receipt. Short for money? Things a bit rough? There's another option. Here are keys to the school. You go to the teachers' room, empty the safe, cash, jewels, gold crowns, final exams, and you get as much ice cream as you want. Ok? Ok, Elvis. ""Ok, Elvis!"" Go ahead, go! Not a chance. Elvis, please, you gotta help me. Don't know 'em, and even if l did, l wouldn't tell you where they are. l'm prepared to pay. A lot. How do you want 'em? Sliced thin, in a bag, or whole? Whole, preferably. Give me a minute and 47 seconds. l don't have cash on me, but... No cash, no Elvis. Please, Elvis, this is a delicate issue. Duvdevani's granny is on her deathbed. l swore l'd bring him to her, her loving grandson. To say goodbye. Think how touching, a grandson bidding goodbye to granny... Yes, touching, the bit about the grandma, and this Duvdevani. lt reminds me of what l went through once with my very own granny. But l got work, so get lost. lf you wanna stick around and bet on the fight, welcome. lt'll be a great fight; the Russian mafia's in. Look at that tank over there. That's Borisov. Borisov! Get it? They bring their guy, l bring mine: Rico. Rico! Don't let his looks fool you, he's a sly fighting fox. Now that l think of it, there's a chance l may be able to help you. l remind you: The first rule in Fight Club is you don't talk about Fight Club! The second rule is: whoever makes poo-poo flushes the toilet. l'm not kidding: you make poo, you flush the toilet. Last week, Genadi... Where's Genadi? He dropped such a load, l paid a plumber 2000 shekels. So no nonsense! You poo, you flush! Forget it, you know what? We changed the rule. Nobody poos here. You stuff yourselves at home and come here to poo? No! l poo at home, then come here. Ok, friends, l am proud to present the first fight. ln the right hand comer, 'big guns' lnspector Franko! ln the left hand corner, Borisov, the slasher from Siberia! Fight! Fight! Fight! Come on, come on! You eat 'im up! - What? Eat 'im up! Eat 'im up! - Let's go! What? - Eat 'im up! We got the RC cola cap! l'm turnin' up the console. l'm shootin' my pistoletta! You make so much noise. The Dubist woke up! Good moming, you slept like a bulldog. What? How long was l asleep? - Two and a half hours. Two and a half hours? Where are we? We decided to go and hide at Grandma Becka's. Grandma Becka rules! What? Where does she live? - Mitzpe Ramon. Mitzpe Ramon rules! Mitzpe Ramon? - Yeah, she's got plenty of room. We can all stay there, nobody'll find us. And there's a great view of the crater. The crater rules! Didn't you say she lived in Ramat Gan? Ramat Gan rules! Stop with that, already! Enough! -Enough! - Enough already! -Enough... Can somebody tell me why we're going to fuckin' Mitzpe Ramon? We just did. Earth to Dubist, what planet you on? Micha, no joke, this is the last day of the contest. Go back. We said we're going to granny's, didn't we, cousin? -We did. Yeah, you said to me: ""cousin, let's go to Granny Becka's."" And l said, great, but you think it's ok with the Dubist back there? We asked you, you didn't object. When did it happen? - Before. We're going to Granny Becka's, ok, man? He's cool with that. 'Cause l was asleep! Asleep! How can l object to something when l'm sleeping? l'm not talking to that dingbat, Duvdevani, tell him to tum around! You know what your problem is, Dubist? You got bad vibes, capiche? Me and cousin here, we're like, it's all good, man! Not you, you're like, it's all no good, man! That's why good things happen to us, right, cousin? -Yup. Look at that.. We shoulda gone to Elvis... Who's Elvis? That's business: one day you're down, one day a giant Russian bear sits on your face. We all been there. But business is business. You got on that note everything you need. l hope this day gets better. You can't imagine what l went through. Judging by your face, l got a pretty good idea. Don't figure me like that, maybe l look tough, but inside l'm mushy like mashed potatoes. Taxi! l'll tell you something else: there are things l'm sorry about, but there's one thing you can say about Shalom Franko: Shalom Franko takes responsibility... Yes! Yes! l beat the bad luck, Elvis. See ya! Don't worry, bitches, a few minutos, & the pussymobile is good to go! lt's six now; in an hour, maximum seven, we'll be home. Hello! Thank god l got through. Can you send me a taxi to... the desert. Hello? Hello? Never mind, never mind... Micha leamed auto mechanics in high school... Shut your pie hole, don't talk to me! Listen, Micha... l know what l'm about to say is gonna be bad for my health, but we really need your help, ok? Wikideevik, Dubist! l know l yelled at you before and maybe l wasn't very nice to you... but l definitely believe in you, man. Ok by me, baby! Cool. So if you could... Great... Marvelous... Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? l'm not home. - May l speak with...? Great. The bitch. - My cousin. Cool. Come on, fix the car. Son of a... Shake that ass, shake that ass! Slap it in the ass, slap it in the ass...! Gazuztra! -Come on, let's do it! Fix our car and get us out of here! No sweat, Dubist, l'll jiggle this cable and we're good to go! Great! What d'ya say? 5 minutos? How long ya think? We're fucked, Dubist. - l don't believe it. l don't believe it, what a dumb ass! Chill out, Dubist! Whose stupid idea was it to drive to Mitzpe Ramon? Who's the dumbbell that took us so far into the fuckin' desert? Only you, you rapper jerk, wannabe, you big fat zero! Stop, it's not his fault. Shut up! A million shekels in my pocket and 'cause of you, l'll get nothing! We should have stayed home a couple hours and gone to their office, which is walking distance. You get me?! We should've asked for help from anybody but this moron! Don't call him a moron! l'm Micha, l'm a rapper... l'm a wannabe, a zapper! Pay no attention to him. l'm Micha's cousin! l'm a dingbat and a moron, too! What's cousin? Who says cousin? You degenerates! lt's cousin!! A family of Neanderthals! No wonder Granny Becka left and ran away to Mitzpe Ramon. Another psychopath! Don't you ever laugh at Granny Becka. Dubist!! He seems a little angry. Here. What is it? - A local plant herb, take it. What? -lt's an herb known for restoring bodily fluids. The prophet Habbakuk lived on it 22 days in the desert. How'd you know that? - Micha was a student of Rabbi Froman. Amazing. They read ""Healing Herbs"" by Maimonides. You got a spectacular cousin. Micha's a genius. He's a human sundial. All right, l've had it. l'm going. You comin' with me? Wait, let's find a trail. Where's the cap? Where is it? Bro, where's the cap? No, not again! Not again! l gave it to Micha. What did you do?! l thought it was best. From a Karma point of view... if a third party holds on to the cap, it'd be safer that way. You gave... You gave it to... - Listen, when l had it, the inspector tried to kill us, right? When you had it, your girls stole it. l thought it'd be safe with Micha. Guys, l found the way out! We're goin' home! See? Micha! -The cap. - Micha! -The cap! Micha? Micha? Gimme your hand. A hand! - Get him! -Cousin! Cousin! Gimme a hand, Asa. - Wait a sec, wait. l'm fallin'. - Here, l got you. Pull me up... cousin... pull me up! l don' wanna die, Dubist! l'm still a virgin! Dubist... l'm slippin'! Help me, Asa! lt's slippery! - Hold him. -lt's slippery! You're slippin', you're slippin'! Micha! Micha! He fell, he fell... What do we do?! - l dunno, l dunno! Asa! l think l broke somethin'! Micha, stay like that, don't move, we'll help you. Don't move. Let's go get somebody. - You think l'd leave him here alone? Staying with him won't help. Let's go get help! Where we gonna now? - l dunno, l got the cap, let's go! Where'd you get the cap? - He gave it to me... when he fell. l don't believe it. You got the cap, and now you wanna go? l told you he gave it to me. Our whole lives, all you care about is you, you, you. And l let you decide for me and abuse me with your lies and manipulations like l was your pet or something! Where's this comin' from now? That's why l find myself always in the same shit where l lose out or get hurt or take everybody's crap, just so you can get whatever it is you want. 'Bro, we got the cap, let's go get help and all will be ok. You're doin' it again! You just use me to get whatever you want. You know what you are? You're a louse, an exploiter, an egotist and a liar just like everybody told me you were. Excuse me? And you're a jellyfish, you got no backbone. You can't make a single good decision in your whole life. l been luggin' you around on my back since third grade. You used to throw up out of panic when the teacher called your name. Now, you see this? My reward for all l lost 'cause of you all these years, you read me? Oh yeah? - Yeah, exactly! What're you doin'? What l think has to be done. Hey, give it here... Are you fuckin' nuts? What'd ya do? - What l should have done long ago. Listen to me good! You can croak for all l care, l don't give a crap anymore. l'm done with you. Loser! You're the new kid, right? Yes, l'm Duvdevani. Why are you shaking? 'Cause everybody laughed at me. - That's the way it is here when a new kid comes. And what if nobody new comes? Won't l have any friends? Don't sweat it, l don't have any, either. So maybe we can be friends? This what you're lookin' for? l don't want this cap, l... We don't need it... This cap... we can't... lt's not... Throw it... llan Kovach? llan Kovach? llan Kovach? What? - llan Kovach, you with us? Where am l? What's going on? Besides getting dehydrated and saved by the rescue team which found on you a poison plant that could've killed a horse, you're ok. Unlike your friend. Where's Duvdevani? Over there, next to his cousin. He's in much worse shape. Micha? Hey, Duvdevani, you all right? No. Don't ask. lt's real bad. Tell me, 'bro, how bad is it? Broken bones all over his body, a tom spleen and 2 holes in his lung. l don't believe it! Here. What's this? Your cap. They found it on Micha. The cap? lf you hurry... You might be in time for the prize. You've got two hours until they close the offices. 'Bro, l'm sorry, l'm such a jerk, geez. l do such stupid stuff, l... l just now realize how much l hurt you and everybody for this... l don't want the prize, not the money, not anything. lf l could only take back what happened... l just want things to be ok between us, that's all l want. What're you doing? What's that? What...? Bravo! Bravo, Dubist! Can somebody tell me what's going on here? What's going on is you did it, 'bro. You passed the ultimate friendship test. l don't get it. You remember we were fired? - So? Avi wanted me to stay on without you, but l refused. He said l'm a sucker, and the reason my life's screwed up is because l'm your friend. Everybody told me that, all my life. So l had to prove to them and to myself that you'd never betray our friendship for anything in the world. So l got all Micha's buddies and we set up this test for you. From the minute we left home; at the mini-market, in the hospital, in the woods, and even in the desert, every last detail was planned. ""Plan"" Wait, wait, let me get this, there never was a campaign? There was, we just didn't win the million shekel cap. You know, it's easy to imitate the voice on an application. Micha recorded it. ""You did not win"". "You won! You are a new millionaire!"" People have to be true to themselves and to the things they believe in. You know, sometimes we find ourselves asking should we give up the things that are important to us just to hold on to a relationship. And you, you succeeded in proving beyond any doubt that real friendship is loyalty at any price. But... we didn't win anything? - Of course we did. We won each other. We got what Osho calls ""unity"". Give me a hug, man, my true friend. l'm going to kill you! Keep away from me! Come here! Let me explain... - Come over here! Didn't it move you? This whole test we set up? Your bullshit almost got me killed, you know that? You almost fucking got me killed! Think about what that says about you as a person, as a friend. l hate you. - Well then, l hate you. l hate both of you equally. Now, give me that friggin' cap, and we'll finish this whole shebang. l never, ever in my life needed to work so hard in order to take something that wasn't mine. Ok, you can cut out the playacting, he told me everything. What playacting? Are you going to give me the cap, or what? Very funny. Yeah, we all got a laugh. Now, beat it, we're busy. No, Kovatch, that's not what... - Hello? Beavis and Butthead, gimme the cap before l... -Game's over! Take the 4 teeth you have left and go find somebody else to fool. An inspector... Don't listen to him, he didn't mean it, all he said was... Duvdevani? l hate this type the most. The ones that interfere. What're you butting in for? Can't you see l'm talking to somebody? l'm gonna count backwards from 10... - Wait... You give me that cap right now. 10... - Wait a sec. 9, 8... - Wait! 7... - There is no cap. 6... - lt was a joke. 5, 4... 3... Hey, 3... Hey! l'm talkin' to you. What're you lookin' at? What the hell...? Sorry, 'bro. l just might have taken it a wee bit too far. No, absolutely not, 'bro. l guess l had to get a good look at myself. l have to thank you. You're a good person and a good friend and l'm an egotistical lowlife, thinking only of myself. - No, no, definitely not. You're my number one guy in the world. l love you, man. - And l love you, too. What the wikidi-wikidi fuck? Cousin? You guys gay? lt's not what you think, he had something... ln my mouth. - l had to get it out... -A grasshopper. He was after us all night. - This motherfucker? You don't know how scary he is. - This motherfucker? Yeah, he almost got us, with his choppers. Fuckin' kill me, cousin, shoot me in the balls and call me flamingo. Tons of bling bling! Whoa, what's that? Wait, l want to remind everybody that the money isn't ours! Of course it is! Truth is, for once, l agree with the Dubist. Absolutely not! lf l leamed anything tonight it's that we're just fine as we are. We may not be rich, but we're happy. Happy with our lot in life. So thanks, but no thanks. We won't use that money! l don't get it, it doesn't bother you? - What? You really think it makes sense to harm a lawman? To hide him in a laundry closet, take the money we found in his pocket, that most likely was taken from poor, innocent people, and use that money to rent a Maserati? Makes perfect sense to me. l'm not so happy with that. - You'd better get over it. Finally, life is good to us. Look at us, all alone! We don't need anybody, especially not that dumb ass cousin of yours! Yaw, bitches, what a motherfucking wikidi-wikidi wik! Cousin! - Cousin! What's he doing here? What are you doing here? Dubist, ya think l won't ride the shaggin' wagon with you? What did you bring him for? We agreed you don't bring him! Why do l go along with your ideas? - Watch out.....!!!
