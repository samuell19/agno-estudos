It is a life that I have desired. I will thrive Well, she was gotten in drink. Is not the humour conceited? Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels There is no remedy. I must cony-catch. I must shift - Young ravens must have food - I love not the humour of bread and cheese Which of you knows Ford of this town? I ken him. He is of substance good - My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about - Two yards or more No quips now, Pistol. Indeed, I am in the waist two yards about But I am now about no waste, I am about thrift Briefly... ...I do mean to make love to Ford's wife I spy entertainment in her She discourses, she carves, she gives the leer of invitation I can construe her action, which is in plain English... ..."I am Sir John Falstaff's" He hath studied her well, and translated her will... ...out of honesty into English Will that humour pass? The report goes, she holds all the rule of her husband's purse He hath a legion of angels - "To her, boy," say I - The humour rises, it's good Humour me those angels I have writ me here a letter to her. And here another to Page's wife... ...who even yesterday gave me good eyes too... ...examined my parts with most judicious oeillades Sometimes the beam of her view gilded my foot, sometimes my portly belly O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a greedy intention... ...that the appetite of her eye did seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass She bears the purse too They shall be my East and West Indies, all gold and bounty... ...and I will trade to them both Go there, bear thou this letter to Mistress Page... ...and thou this, to Mistress Ford We will thrive, lads, we will thrive! Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become, and by my side wear steel? Lucifer take all! I will run no base humour. You take the letter, I will keep my reputation - And I mine honour - Thine honour! I have been content, sirs, you should lay my countenance to pawn I am damned in hell for swearing my friends, you were good and tall fellows And when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her fan... ...I took't upon mine honour thou hadst it not - Didst not we share? - Hadst you not fifteen pence? Reason, you rogues, reason. Thinkest thou I'll endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more about me You would not bear a letter for me, you rogues? Hence, avaunt! Vanish like hailstones, go! Trudge, plod away o' the hoof, seek shelter, pack! Falstaff will learn the humour of this age French thrift, you rogues You boy, be you my page - What's your name? - Robin - Robin, bear you these letters tightly - Yes, Sir John Let vultures gripe thy guts, base Phrygian Turk!

That is my true humour Thou art the Mars of malcontents - Really? - I second thee, troop on John Rugby! I prithee, go to the casement... ...and see if you can see my master, Doctor Caius, coming If he do, i' faith, and find any body in the house, he will be horn mad I'll go watch Go And we'll have a posset for it soon at night, in faith An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant come in house withal And, I warrant you, no tell-tale nor no breed-bate His worst fault is, that he is given to prayer He is something peevish that way, but... ...nobody but has his fault But let that pass Peter Simple, you say your name is? Ay, for want of a better - And Master Slender's your master? - Ay - A softly-sprighted man, is he not? - Ay, forsooth He's as tall a man of his hands as any is between this and his head I do remember him Does he not hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait? Yes, indeed, does he Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune Tell Mister Parson Evans I'll do what I can for your master - Anne's a good girl, and I... - Out, alas! Here comes my master We shall all be shent! Run in here, good young man. Go in this closet He will not stay long What is you sing? I do not like these toys Fe, fe, fe, fe, fe!

There is no honest man that shall come in my closet I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic Hear the truth of it He comes of an errand to me from Parson Hugh Errand? What errand? - He would desire... - Peace, I pray you Peace in your mouth Speak your tale He will desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid... ...to speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page... ...for my master, Master Slender, in the way of marriage This is all, indeed But I would ne'er have done it Sir Hugh send you? Baille-moi du papier, Rugby Prepare me some paper You, wait little while I am glad he is so quiet If he'd been thoroughly moved, you should have heard him so loud But listen, I'll do you your master what good I can But the thing is, the French doctor, my master, well, I... My master, well, I call him my master, for I keep his house I wash, wring, brew, bake, scour... ...dress meat and drink, make the beds and do all myself... ...but he, my master, is in love with Mistress Anne Page himself But notwithstanding that, I know Anne's mind You jackanape, you give this letter to Sir Hugh By gar, it is a challenge I will cut his throat in the park And I will teach a scurvy jackanape priest to meddle You may be gone. It is not good you tarry here By gar, I will cut all his two couilles... ..."bollocks" By gar, he will not have a ball left to throw for his dog Alas, he speaks but for his friend It's no matter for that Do not you tell me that. I shall have Anne Page for myself By gar, I will kill the priest And I have assigned mine Hostess of the Garter to decide where we meet... ...to measure our weapons By gar, I will myself have Anne Page Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well We must give folk leave to prate Rugby, come to the court with me By gar, if I do not have Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my doors Follow my heels, Rugby You shall have An... fool's head of your own - Who's there? - What ho Oh Master Fenton! Come in, I pray you How now, good woman, how dost thou? The better that it pleases your good worship to ask What news? How does pretty Mistress Anne? In truth, and she is pretty, and honest, and gentle, and she is your friend I can tell you that, and I praise heaven for it Shall I do any good, thinkest thou? Shall I not lose my suit? Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a book, she loves you - Have not your worship a wart above your eye? - Yes, marry, have I. What of that? Well, thereby hangs a tale Good faith, she is such a one. But, I detest, an honest maid as ever broke bread We had an hour's talk of that wart Indeed, she's much given to allicholy and musing for you Well, I shall see her today. Hold, there's money for thee Let me have thy voice in my behalf. If thou seest her before me, commend me Will I? I'faith, that I will And I will tell your worship more of the wart the next time we have confidence... ...and of other wooers - Well, farewell. I am in great haste now - Farewell to your worship Truly, an honest gentleman But Anne loves him not, for I know Anne's mind for that Never a woman in Windsor knows more of Anne's mind than I do Out upon't, what have I forgot? What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-time of my beauty... ...and am I now a subject for them? Let me see "Ask me no reason why I love you" "For though Love use Reason for his confessor..." "...he admits him not for his counsellor" "You are not young..." "...no more am I. Go to then, there's sympathy" "You are merry, so am I. Ha, ha, then there's more sympathy" "You love drink, and so do I. Would you desire better sympathy?" "Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page, at least, if the love of soldier can suffice..." "...that I love thee" "I will not say, pity me, 'tis not a soldier-like phrase. But I say, love me" "By me, thine own true knight, By day or night, or any kind of light" "With all his might for thee to fight..." "...John Falstaff" John Falstaff? O wicked world! A man that is well-nigh worn to pieces with age... ...showing himself a young gallant! And what an unweighed behaviour... ...hath this Flemish drunkard picked out of my conversation... ...that he dares in this manner assay me? Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What did I say to him? I was then frugal of my mirth, heaven forgive me Why, I'll exhibit a bill in the parliament for the putting down of men How shall I be revenged on him? For revenged I will be, as sure as his guts are made of puddings Mistress Page! Meg! Alice! You look very ill Nay, I'll ne'er believe that, I have to show to the contrary - Oh Meg, give me some counsel - What's the matter? If it were not for one trifling respect, I could come to such honour Hang the trifle, woman, take the honour. What is it? Dispense with trifles, what is it? If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so... ...I could be knighted - What? - Here, read, read Perceive how I might be knighted I shall think the worse of fat men... ...as long as I have an eye to make difference of men's liking How shall I be revenged on him? I think the best way were to entertain him with hope... ...until the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease Did you ever hear the like? Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and Ford differs Here's the twin-brother to thy letter I warrant he hath a thousand of these letters... ...writ with blank space for different names Sure, more, and he will print them, out of doubt For he cares not what he puts into the press, when he would put us two I will find you twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man Why, this is the very same, the very hand, the very words - What doth he think of us? - Nay, I know not Sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I know not myself... ...he would never have boarded me in this fury "Boarding" call you it? I'll be sure to keep him above deck So will I If he come under my hatches, I'll never to sea again Let's be revenged on him I will consent to act any villany against him, that may not sully the chariness of our honesty That my husband saw this letter! It would give eternal food to his jealousy My husband's as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause You are the happier woman Let's consult together against this greasy knight Come, come - Nay, I hope it be not so - And this is true I love not the humour of lying - He loves your wife - Yes, Sir John affects thy wife Why, sir, my wife is not young He loves your wife. There's the short and the long He woos both high and low, both rich and poor both young and old... ...one with another, he loves them all Loves my wife! My name is Nym And Falstaff loves your wife With liver burning hot Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing Adieu Believe it, Page, he speaks sense Farewell I will find out this "The humour of it," quoth he! Here's a fellow frights English out of his wits - I will seek out Falstaff - I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue - If I do find it, well - I will not believe him 'Twas a good sensible fellow, well You heard what this knave told me, did you not? - Yeah, and you heard what the other told me? - Do you think there's truth in 'em? Hang 'em, slaves! These that accuse him in his intent towards our wives... ...are a yoke of his discarded men. Very rogues, now they be out of service - Were they his men? - Marry, were they I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at the Garter? Ay, marry, does he If he should intend this voyage towards my wife, I shall turn her loose to him And what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it lie on my head I do not misdoubt my wife, but I would be loath to turn 'em together A man may be too confident - Whither go you, George? - How now, Meg How now, sweet Frank Why art thou melancholy? I melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you in, go Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head. Will you go in, Meg? Have with you. You'll come to dinner, George Look who comes yonder She shall be our messenger to this paltry knight Aye, I thought on her. She'll fit it You are come to see my daughter Anne? Ay, forsooth. And how does good Mistress Anne? Go in with us and see. We'll have an hour's talk with you - Bully-rook! - I follow, mine Hostess, I follow Look where my ranting Hostess of the Garter comes There is either liquor in her pate or money in her purse... ...when she looks so merrily - How now, bully-rook! - How now, mine Hostess Good day, good Mister Page! Mister Page, will you go with us? - We have sport in hand - Tell him, Cavaliero Justice, tell him Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh the Welsh priest... ...and Caius the French doctor Good mine Hostess of the Garter, a word with you What sayest thou? Will you go with us to behold it? My merry Hostess... My merry Hostess... My merry Hostess hath appointed them contrary places Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in his rapier Ah Mister Page, I have seen the time, with my long sword... ...I would have made four tall fellows skip like rats You mean my knight, my guest Sir John? I do! And I'll give you a bottle of burnt sack to give me recourse to him... ...and tell him my name is Brook, only for a jest My hand, bully Thou shalt have egress and regress. Said I well? And thy name shall be Brook He is a merry knight. Will you go with us? - Come come, mine Hostess - Boys, boys, let us wag Though Page be a secure fool, he stands so firmly on his wife's frailty... ...yet I cannot put off my opinion so easily She was in Falstaff's company at Page's house... ...and what they made there, I know not Well, I will look further into it. And I'll have a disguise to sound Falstaff If I find her honest, I lose not my labour If she be otherwise... ...'tis labour well bestowed Sir... ...there's a woman would speak with you - Let her approach Cheers - Give your worship good morrow - Good morrow, good wife - Not so, an't please your worship - Good maid, then I'll be sworn, as my mother was, the first hour I was born I do believe the swearer What with me? Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two? Two thousand, fair lady, and I'll vouchsafe thee the hearing There is one Mistress Ford, sir I pray, come a little nearer this ways - I myself dwell with Master Doctor Caius - Well, on. Mistress Ford, you say Your worship says very true I pray your worship, come a little nearer this ways - Bardolph... thingamajig... - Robin! Get thee hence Well now Mistress Ford. What of her? Why, sir, she's a good creature Lord, Lord! Your worship's a wanton Heaven forgive you and all of us, I pray Mistress Ford. Come, Mistress Ford Marry, this is the short and the long of it You have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis wonderful The best courtier of them all could never have brought her to such a canaries Yet, there has been knights, and lords... ...and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant you Coach after coach... ...letter after letter, gift after gift, smelling so sweetly all musk And so rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold, that would have won any woman's heart And, I warrant you, they could never get an eye-wink of her They could never get her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all And which is more, there has been earls, but, I warrant you, all is one with her But what says she to me? Be brief, my good she-Mercury Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which she thanks you a thousand times And she gives you to notify that her husband will be absence from his house... ...between five and six this evening - Five and six? - Ay, truly And then you may come and see the picture, she says, that you wot of Mister Ford, her husband, will be from home Alas! the sweet woman leads an ill life with him He's a very jealousy man She leads a very frampold life with him, good heart Five and six. Woman, commend me to her. I will not fail her Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to your worship Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations to you too And let me tell you in your ear... ...she is as fartuous a civil modest wife as any in these parts And she bade me tell you that her husband is seldom from home But she hopes there will come a time La! I never knew any two women so dote upon a man In truth, I think you have charms Charms? No, not I, I assure you Setting the attractions of my good parts aside... ...I have no other charms - Blessings on your heart for it! - But, I pray thee, tell me this Has Ford's wife and Page's wife... ...acquainted each other how they love me? That were a jest indeed! They would not have so little grace, I hope. That were a trick indeed But Mistress Page desires that you send her your servant Robin Her husband has a marvellous infection for the boy And then he may come and go between you both that you may know one another's mind Why, I will. Robin, go along with this woman Fare thee well, commend me to them both. I am yet thy debtor This news distracts me! Well, go thy ways old Jack I'll make more of thy old body than I have done Wilt thou yet look after me? Wilt thou, after the expense of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body... ...I thank thee Sir John Sir John, there's one Mister Brook without... ...would fain speak with you, and be acquainted with you And hath sent your worship a morning's draught of sack Brook is his name? - Ay, sir - Call him in Such Brooks are welcome to me, that o'erflow such liquor - Bless you, sir - And you, sir. Would you speak with me? Bardolph, give us leave Sir, I am a gentleman. The name is Brook, Yakov Brook Good Mister Yakov Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you Good Sir John, I sue for yours. And I have a bag of money here troubles me If you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all or half, for easing me of the carriage Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter I will tell you There is a gentlewoman in this town. Her husband's name... - ...is Ford - Well, sir I have long loved her And, I protest to you, bestowed much on her Not only bought many presents to give her... ...but have also given to others to know what she would wish to be given Briefly, I have pursued her as love hath pursued me... ...which hath been on the wing of all occasions. But.. ...whatsoever I have merited, reward, I am sure, I have received none Unless experience be a jewel that hath taught me to say this... Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues Pursuing that it flies, and flying what pursues Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands? - Never - Have you importuned her to such an end? - Never! - To what purpose then have you... ...unfolded this to me? When I have told you that, I have told you all Some say, that though she appear honest to me... ...yet in other places, she enlarges her mirth so far... ...that there is shrewd construction made of her Now, Sir John, here is the heart of my purpose You are a gentleman of excellent breeding... ...great standing, admirable discourse, respected in your place and person - O, sir! - Believe it, sir, for you know it There is money Take some Only give me so much of your time in exchange of it... ...as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford's wife Use your art of wooing Vooing? Wooing. Win her to consent to you. If any man may, you may Would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection... ...that I should win what you would enjoy? Understand my drift She dwells so securely on the excellency of her honour... ...that the wantonness of my soul dares not present itself She is too bright to be looked against But, could I could come to her with any detection in my hand... ...my desires had evidence and argument to commend themselves What say you to it, Sir John? Mister Brook, I will first make bold with your money Next, give me your hand. And last, as I am a gentleman... ...you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife Want no money, Sir John. You shall want none Want no Mistress Ford, Mister Brook, you shall want none I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her own appointment Even as you came in to me, her assistant or go-between parted from me I say I shall be with her between five and six For at that time the jealous rascally knave her husband will be forth Come to me at night. You shall know how I speed - Do you know Ford, Sir John? - I know him not But they say he hath masses of money... ...for the which his wife seems to me well-favoured I will use her as the key of her cuckoldy husband's coffers I would you knew him, sir, that you might avoid him if you saw him Hang him, vulgar salt-butter rogue! I will stare him out of his wits, I will awe him with my cudgel Thou, Mister Brook, shalt know I will predominate over this peasant... ...and thou shalt lie with his wife Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style Thou, Mister Brook, shall know him for a knave and cuckold Come to me soon at night What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is ready to crack with impatience Who says this is improvident jealousy? My wife hath sent to him. The hour is fixed, the match is made Would any man have thought this?

See the results of his search Is there not a double excellency in this? I know not which pleases me better, that my husband is deceived, or Sir John What a shaking was he in when your husband asked what was in the wheelie bin I think my husband hath some special suspicion of Falstaff's being here For I never saw him so gross in his jealousy till now I will lay a plot to try that, and we will yet have more tricks with Falstaff Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress Quickly, to him again... ...to excuse his throwing into the canal? And give him another hope, to betray him to another punishment? We will do it. Let him be sent for again I cannot find him.

Well, if I be served such another trick, I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered... ...and give them to a dog for a new-year's gift The rogues slighted me into the filthy water with as little remorse... ...as they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies, fifteen in the litter And you may know by my size that I have a kind of... ...alacrity in sinking If the bottom were as deep as hell, I should down I had been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and shallow Drowning is a death that I abhor, for the water swells a man And what a thing should I have been when I had been swelled! Here's your sack, sir And there's Mistress Quickly, sir - Shall I admit her? - Call her in Come in, woman By your leave I cry you mercy.

Did she change her determination? No, Mister Brook For no sooner had we embraced, kissed, protested... ...and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy... ...but the sneaking cuckold her husband... ...dwelling in a continual hysteria of jealousy and distemper... ...comes me in that instant, and at his heels a rabble of his companions... ...to search his house for his wife's love - What, while you were there? - While I was there And did he search for you, and could not find you? You shall hear As good luck would have it, comes in one Mistress Page... ...gives intelligence of Ford's approach... ...and, in her invention, they conveyed me into a wheelie bin - A wheelie bin? - By the Lord, a wheelie bin Oh Mister Brook, what I have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good A wheelie bin so rammed me in with foul matter... ...that there was the rankest compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril - And how long lay you there? - You shall hear Being thus crammed in the wheelie bin... ...a couple of Ford's knaves were called forth by their mistress to convey me out But they met the jealous knave, their master, coming in... ...who asked them once or twice, what they had in their wheelie bin I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave should have searched it But fate, ordaining he should be a cuckold, held his hand Well, on went he for a search, and away went I for foul dregs A man of my kidney. think of that, Mister Brook... ...that am as subject to heat as butter, stopped in with stinking swill and scrapings Think of that, Mister Brook! It was a miracle I scaped suffocation And in the height of this bath, when I was more than half stewed in my own grease... ...to be thrown into a canal, and cooled... ...glowing hot, into that surge, like a horse-shoe Think of that, hissing hot Think of that, Mister Brook In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you have suffered all this My suit then is desperate. You'll undertake her no more? Not so, Mister Brook I will be thrown into Etna ere I leave her thus Her husband is tomorrow a-golfing I have received from her another embassy of meeting in the fore-noon Come to me at your convenient leisure in the afternoon... ...and you shall know how I speed And the conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her You shall have her, Mister Brook.

Still seek it, sir If opportunity and humblest suit cannot attain it, why, then... Hark you, hither! Mistress Quickly, break their talk.

In my house I am sure he is My intelligence is true, my jealousy is reasonable Here is no man Nom de dieu! Mister Ford, you must pray, and not follow the imaginations of your own heart This is jealousies. The coals thereof are fiery coals and a vehement flame - He's not here I seek for - No, nor nowhere else but in your brain Help to search my house this one time If I find not what I seek, for ever let me be your table-sport Satisfy me once more. Once more search with me What, ho, Mistress Page! Come you and the old woman down - My husband will come into the chamber - Old woman! What old woman's that? It is my maid, Elena Popescu, her aunt, the fat woman of Brentwood The fat woman of Brentwood! - The witch! - She's a witch? You witch, you hag, you come down, I say! Nay, good, sweet husband! Good gentlemen, let him not harass the old woman Come, give me your hand Mother Popescu - Popescu? I'll Popescu you! - No, Mister Ford Ford? - Where is she? - Have we killed her? Elle a disparu, la sorcière - Oh my god! - Hang her, witch! By yea and no, I think the woman is a witch I like it not when a woman has such hair upon her chest Now, gentlemen, I beseech you, follow me. See but the issue of my jealousy - What? - Falstaff is here If I cry out thus upon no trail, never trust me when I cry again Let's obey his humour a little further. Follow, gentlemen He beat him most pitifully Nay, by the mass, that he did not. Methought he beat him most unpitifully What think you? May we, with the warrant of womanhood... ...and the witness of a good conscience... ...pursue him with any further revenge? The spirit of wantonness is, sure, scared out of him He will never, I think, attempt us again Get off Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him? By all means, yes, if it be but to scrape the figures out of your husband's brains I'll warrant they'll have him publicly shamed But if the unvirtuous fat knight shall be any further afflicted... - ...we two will still be the ministers - We will Come, to the forge with it then, shape it. I would not have things cool Forsooth, I would my master had Mistress Anne... ...or I would Master Slender had her Or, in sooth, I would Master Fenton had her I will do what I can for them all three... ...for so I have promised, and I'll be as good as my word But speciously for Master Fenton But now, I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from my two mistresses What a beast am I to slack it! I don't believe it! And did he send you both these letters at an instant? Within a quarter of an hour Pardon me, wife Henceforth do what thou wilt I rather will suspect the sun with cold than thee with wantonness Now doth thy honour stand, in him that was late an heretic... ...as firm as faith 'Tis well, 'tis well All right, all right! No more But let our plot go forward Let our wives yet once again, to make us public sport... ...meet with this old fat fellow, where we may take him and disgrace him for it How shall he come to us? They've sent him word they'll meet him in the square at midnight You say he's been thrown in the canal and has been grievously beaten as a witch Methinks there should be terrors in him that he should not come Methinks his flesh is punished... ...he shall have no desires Devise but how you'll use him when he comes, we have devised the way to bring him there There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter, sometime a keeper here about the town... ...doth some midsummer eves, at still midnight... ...walk round the square, with great ragged horns And there he cries and shakes a chain in a most hideous and dreadful manner Yeah, and there want not many that do fear in deep of night to walk by that place Boo! - But what of this? - Marry, this is our device That Falstaff at that place shall meet with us... ...disguised like Herne with huge horns on his head Well, let it not be doubted but that he'll come, and in this shape But when you have brought him thither, what shall be done with him? What is your plot? That likewise have we thought upon, and thus Anne Page, my daughter, you my husband... ...nay, all of you... Sir Hugh, the good Doctor, Mister Shallow... when he's out of A&E... All the fat Knight's discarded men, our Hostess and the girl... you'll dress like ghosts and spirits and upon a sudden as Falstaff... ...she and I, are newly met, look you rush out with some diffused cry Upon your sight, we two in great amazedness will fly Then do you encircle him about... ...and ask him why that hour he dares to walk the town in such a shape And till he tell the truth, then let you all torment him with your flares The truth being known, we'll then present ourselves... ...dis-horn the spirit, and mock him till the dawn Brilliant We must be practised and prepared well to this - I shall assemble all the group - That will be excellent. I'll go and buy us vizards And I'll to him again in name of Brook He'll tell us all his purpose. I'm sure he'll come Fear not you that Go get us properties and tricking for our company Let us about it. It is admirable pleasures and very honest knaveries I have a thought that in this time... ...shall Master Slender steal my Anne away and marry her tonight Now must I to the Doctor He hath my good will, for none but he shall marry with Anne Page That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot And, he, my husband, best of all affects The Doctor is well moneyed, and his friends potent at court He, none but he, shall have her Hit it! Oh, if it should come to the ear of the court, how I have been transformed And how my transformation hath been cudgelled... ...they would melt me out of my fat, drop by drop... ...and liquor fishermen's boots with me I warrant they would whip me with their fine wits... ...till I were as crest-fallen as a dried pear Well, if my wind were but long enough to say my prayers... ...I would repent Can I help you, Madam? No, thank you so much I'm just about to retire to my boudoir Oh, you are awful But I like you Oh, you look lovely - Where is Falstaff? - Nay I know not But there's a woman, a fat woman, just gone into his chamber A fat woman? The knight might be robbed I'll call Bully knight! Bully Sir John! Art thou there? Speak from thy lungs military - 'Tis thine Hostess calls - How now, mine Hostess! Let thy fat woman come out, bully, my chambers are honourable There was, mine Hostess... ...an old wise woman even now with me, but she's gone - A wise woman? - Ay, mine Hostess One that hath taught me more than ever I learned before in my life Bardolph! Robin! Now, whence come you? >From the two parties, forsooth The devil take one party and his dam the other! I have suffered more for their sakes... ...more than the villanous inconstancy of man's disposition is able to bear And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant you, speciously one of them Mistress Ford, good heart, is beaten black and blue What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was, myself, beaten into all the colours of the rainbow And but that my admirable dexterity of wit... ...my counterfeiting the action of an old woman, delivered me... ...I was like to be set in the stocks, in the common stocks, by a constable... ...for the old witch of Brentwood Sir, let me speak, and you shall hear how things go, and, I warrant, to your content Here is a letter will say somewhat Good hearts, what ado is here to bring you together! Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that you are so crossed Yes... 'Tis all set, and I will do what I can to get you a pair of horns This is the third time, I hope good luck lies in odd numbers Away. Time wears. Hold up your head and mince Bless you, sir How now, Mister Brook! Mister Brook, the matter will be known to-night, or never Be you in the square about midnight, and you shall see wonders Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me you had appointed? I went to her, Mister Brook, as you see, like a poor old man But I came from her, Mister Brook, like a poor old woman That same knave Ford, her husband... ...hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him, Mister Brook, that ever governed frenzy I'll tell you all, Mister Brook. I'll tell you strange things of this knave Ford... ...on whom tonight I will be revenged... ...and I will deliver his wife into your hands Strange things afoot, Mister Brook! Strange things afoot How now, good Mistress Hostess Talk not to me, Master Fenton, my mind is heavy Yet hear me speak, assist me in my purpose And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee one hundred pounds in gold I will hear thee, Master Fenton - Oh, I like your glasses - Yes >From time to time I have acquainted you with the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page... ...who mutually hath answered my affection, even to my wish I have a letter from her of such contents as you will wonder at, the mirth whereof... ...so mingled with my matter, that neither singly can be manifested, without the show of both Fat Falstaff hath a great scene. The image of the jest I'll show you here at large Hark, good Hostess This midnight in the square, just 'twixt twelve and one... ...must my sweet Anne present a ghostly scene The purpose why, is here. In which disguise, while other jests are something rank on foot... ...her father hath commanded her to slip away with Slender... ...and with him away, immediately to marry She hath consented Now, mistress, her mother, ever strong against that match and firm for Doctor Caius... ...hath appointed that he shall likewise shuffle her away... ...while other sports are tasking of their minds And at the deanery, where a priest attends, straight marry her To this her mother's plot she seemingly obedient likewise hath made promise to the Doctor Now, thus it rests. Her father means she shall be all in white And in that shade, when Slender sees his time to take her by the hand and bid her go... ...she shall go with him Her mother hath intended, the better to denote her to the Doctor... ...for they must all be masked and vizarded... ...that quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed... ...and when the Doctor spies his vantage ripe... ...to pinch her by the hand, and, on that token, the maid hath given consent to go with him Which means she to deceive, father or mother? Both, my good Hostess, to go along with me Now, thus it rests... Oh no! Put 'em back on ...that you'll procure the vicar... ...to stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one And, in the lawful name of marrying, to give our hearts united ceremony Well, husband your device, I'll to the vicar Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest So shall I evermore be bound to thee. Besides, I'll make thee a present recompense Cousin, cousin! It's me Right we'll couch far off till we see the others all are come - Remember, son Slender, my daughter - Ay, forsooth I have spoke with her and we have a code-word how to know one another I come to her in white and cry "mum"... ...and she cries "budget". And by that we know one another "Mum"? "Budget"? What need you that? The white will decipher her well enough - It hath struck ten - Heaven prosper our sport No man means evil but the devil, and we shall know him by his horns Come, gentlemen, let's away - Good Doctor, my daughter is in green - Green When you see your time, take her by the hand... ...away with her to the deanery, and dispatch it quickly I know what I have to do Go before us into the square, we two must go together - Adieu - Fare you well, sir My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of Falstaff... ...as he will chafe at the Doctor's marrying my daughter But 'tis no matter. Better a little chiding than a great deal of heartbreak Where is Anne now and her troop of ghosts, and the Welsh phantom Hugh? They are gone to couch themselves around the square, with obscured lights Which, at the very instant of Falstaff's and our meeting... ...they will at once display to the night That cannot choose but amaze him If he be not amazed, he will be mocked. If he be amazed, he will every way be mocked We'll betray him finely Against such lewdsters and their lechery, those that betray them do no treachery - The hour draws on. To the square! - Tally ho The church bell hath struck twelve, the minute draws on Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me! Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa Love set on thy horns O powerful love, that, in some respects makes a beast a man In some other... ...a man a beast For me, I am here a rutting stag And I think the fattest in the forest Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can blame me to piss my tallow? But who comes here? My doe? Sir John! Art thou there? My deer? My male deer? My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain potatoes... ...let it thunder to the tune of Greensleeves... Hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes... ...let there come a tempest of provocation I will shelter me here Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart Divide me like a bribed buck, each a haunch... ...and my horns I bequeath your husbands Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience, he makes restitution Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter? As I am a true spirit, welcome! - Alas, what noise? - Heaven forgive our sins - What should this be? - Away, away! I think the devil will not have me damned... ...lest the oil that's in me should set hell on fire He would never else cross me thus Spirits, black, grey, green, and white... ...you moonshine revellers and shades of night You orphan heirs of fixed destiny... ...attend your office and your quality These are ghosts! And he that speaks to them must die I'll wink and crouch. No man their works must eye But, stay, I smell a man of middle-earth Vile worm, thou wast o'erlooked even in thy birth With trial-fire touch me his lower-end If he be chaste, the flame will back descend, and turn him to no pain But if he start, it is the flesh of a corrupted heart - A trial, come - Come, will this wood take fire? Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted with desire Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted with desire Run! Pray you, hold up the jest no higher Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives? Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Mister Brook, Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave Here are his horns, Mister Brook And, Mister Brook... ...he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford's, except... ...his wheelie bin, his cudgel, and this hour upon that stone Sweet Sir John, we have had ill luck, we could never meet I will never take you for my love again... ...but I will always count you my deer I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass And these are not spirits I was three or four times in the thought they were not And yet the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my powers... ...drove the grossness of this foppery... ...into a received belief, in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent... ...when 'tis upon ill employment Sir John Falstaff, serve God, leave your desires... ...and spirits will not haunt you - Well said, Sir Hugh - And leave your jealousies too, I pray you I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art able to woo her in good English English? Dim gwerth rhech dafad! He's Welsh... Sir John Falstaff, you are given to fornications... ...and taverns and sack and wine and metheglins... ...and drinkings and swearings and starings and pribbles... ...and prabbles Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? To stand at the taunt of one that make fritters of English? Well, I am your theme. You have the start of me I am dejected I am not able to answer this Welsh flannel Use me as you will Marry, sir, let that you have suffered be biting affliction enough Yet be cheerful, knight Thou shalt drink a posset tonight at my house... ...where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife, who now laughs at thee Tell her... Master Slender hath married her daughter Doctors doubt that Whoa ho, father Page Son, how now! How now, son! Have you dispatched? - Dispatched! There's a word for it! - For what, son? I came yonder to the church to marry Mistress Anne Page, and she's... ...Simple, my serving man If it hadn't been in the church, I would have swinged you - Upon my life, then, you took the wrong - What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl. For this apparel I might have married him This is your own folly! Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments? I came to her in white, cried "mum"... ...and she cried "budget", as Anne and I had appointed And yet it was not Anne, but... him Good George, be not angry I knew of your purpose and turned my daughter into green And, indeed, she is now with the Doctor at the deanery, and there married Where is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened I have married un garçon, it is not Anne Page By gar, I am cozened Why, took you her in green? Oui, by gar! It's not an 'er, it's an 'im It's a Nym My name is Nym And we are married This is strange. Who hath the right Anne? My heart misgives me. Here comes Master Fenton How do you, Master Fenton! Pardon, good father! Good my mother, pardon! Now, good mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender? - Why went you not with the Doctor, maid? - You do afright her. Hear the truth of it You would have married her most shamefully... ...where there was no proportion held in love The truth is, she and I, long since contracted... ...are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us The offence is holy that she hath committed And this deceit loses the name of craft, of disobedience, or unduteous title... ...since therein she doth evitate and shun a thousand irreligious cursed hours... ...that forced marriage would have brought upon her Stand not afraid, here is no remedy In love the heavens themselves do guide the state Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to strike at me... ...that your arrows have glanced When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased Out! What cannot be eschewed must be embraced Fenton! Heaven give thee joy And I will muse no further neither Good Master Fenton. Heaven grant you many, many merry days Good husband, let us every one go home... ...and laugh this sport o'er a country fire - Sir John and all - Let it be so, Sir John To Mister Brook you yet shall hold your word... ...for he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford
