So, we make it to shore, finally. Bill, this is the first time I've ever been in a kayak. So, I am trying to get out of the thing and my foot, it gets... it gets caught on the side of the boat. - Hmm. - And we go over. Keep in mind this is David, he is the head of the Water-Sports company, he goes under in front of all of his employees. I know, I know, it's not my shiniest moment. Needless to say, that was the first and last time I ever took a client kayaking. Fortunately, Janie's marketing genius led to the company's best quarter in five years, so David was quick to forgive her. Quite the story. Lucky for you, I don't kayak, I just don't kayak. Thank you Bill! No kayaking! Alright everyone, let's get to it, we haven't closed for Christmas quite yet. Hey! Hey. - What are you doing here? - Oh, well, I thought I could take you out for a romantic dinner. What? Does a guy need an ulterior motive to pick up his girlfriend from work? Hmm... And you know, if you happen to know any wealthy clients who may need help with their finances... I will slip him your card. - Janie, do you have a moment? - Oh, yeah, oh, you remember my boyfriend, Charles? Of course. It's good to see you again. - You too. - And this man we're schmoozing is Bill Rivers-- President of Dinosaur Energy Drinks? That's right. I'm pretty sure the schmoozing will soon be over now that I've become a client. - Well, it's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. You know, Janie loves your products. Before spin class, she always chugs a Green Tea-Rex to help her power through it. Always happy to meet a satisfied customer. That's me. I must say, I like the team you have here, Elle. I could use more sharp minds like hers. Hmm. Well, Janie, before you leave for the day, can I steal a quick moment? - Yeah, of course. I'll be back. - We'll just be a minute. Bill, Charles Miller, Miller Investments. Miller Investments? Can I talk to you about your portfolio? That true what your boyfriend said back there? You actually drink this stuff before you work out? No, you know me, when am I gonna work out? Okay, have a seat. Janie, you were amazing in that room. Bill took such a shine to you. I want you to take point on his campaign. Are you serious? Yeah. Okay, great, thank you. No need to thank me, you earned it. In fact, you know what? I'm gonna get started right away. Hold on. I thought you would say that. But listen, I know that you're headed tomorrow back upstate to... - Woodland Falls. - Right. I'm sorry about your uncle. Randall, right? He was my great uncle. But thank you, he was a really special man. Take as much time as you need to get his affairs in order. Bill's out of town until Christmas, so we've got a couple of weeks. Well, I only need a few days. However, when I get back, I am going to LA with Charles for a week for a vacation, so. Good. I cannot remember the last holiday where you didn't at least drop by the office. Seriously, enjoy your time off. - Okay. I will. But I am gonna bring my computer. Figured as much. I am proud of you. Thanks. It was a good day for me too, I talked Bill into letting me look at his portfolio. Nice. You and I make quite the team. Yes we do. Speaking of which, have you thought anymore about coming to Woodland Falls with me? You know I would love to, I just have so much going on, and now I've gotta meet with Bill-- Hmm, okay. Could you seriously see me on a farm? No. But you know what? I haven't been there since I was ten years old. I mean, maybe it's not a farm anymore. Maybe it's a resort with a spa? Oh, you know, I promise you... It sounds like that, it's gonna be exactly the same. You know what's so weird, though? It's that it's only three hours away but it just feels so far for me. Good news is you're only gonna be there for a few days. I mean, seriously, how long can it take to pack up a farmhouse? Yeah. Alright. I'm going to leave, get out of your hair so you can actually finish packing. Hmm. But I will see you in a few days. Okay, I can't wait. And then a week of poolside lounging. Ah, yes! - See you soon. - Good night, thank you for dinner. - Of course. ♪ Joy to the world The Lord has come ♪ ♪ Let Earth receive her King ♪ Welcome back, Janie. ♪ Let every heart Prepare him room ♪ ♪ And heaven and nature sing ♪ Janie Collins. How long's it been? 20 years? Ugh, yeah, I guess so Mr. Reynolds, although you have not changed a bit. Well, I'll try and take that as a compliment. And please, call me Sidney, you're not 10 anymore. I know I mentioned this over the phone, but I can't tell you how sorry I am about Randall. He was more than just a client, he was a dear friend. Thank you. That means a lot. Anyway, better take care of business. Randall provided a list of the valuables he wished to bequeath to his friends in town. As executor of his estate, everything else is up to you. Right. And I'll be here for a few days, I'm gonna pack up his things and then, I'll decide what to do with the rest. Sure. And, of course, your inheritance. I'm... I'm sorry, my inheritance? Mm-hmm. I didn't know I had an inheritance. Yes, I know. Randall, he insisted I deliver this news in person. You know, Janie, I fear you may not be prepared for the magnitude of what he left you. He left me the farm? That's right. The land, the equipment, the farmhouse, everything other than what he specified in that first document, it's all yours. Okay, but what am I supposed to do with a farm? Whatever you want. It's yours. Keep it, hire someone to run it, sell it, which I'd be happy to help you with, if you'd like. Can I ask if he confided in you why he gave me the farm? Perhaps this can shed a little light on things. Randall gave me that, asked me to make sure it got into your hands. What is this? My guess: answers to your questions. Oh. Hello! Hello? Hello, what are you doing here? Sir! What... Ugh. Hi. Did you just throw a snowball at me? Yes, I did, I was trying to get your attention to ask what you're doing here. I can't hear you! I was just... Could you take those... What?! Could you just turn the tractor off? I'm gonna turn the tractor off! Good idea. Are you here for the eggs? - Am I... What? - The fresh eggs. You want some? Uh, no. I don't want any eggs, I don't need eggs. I'm just wondering what you're doing here. Janie? - Yes? - Are you Janie Collins? - Yes. - Wow. I mean, I haven't seen you in forever! You don't remember me, do you? - Hm, no, should I? I mean, you spent literally like every day at my house as kids, you and my sister were inseparable. Are you Nicole's brother? Yeah. - Dylan? - Dylan, yeah, right. Wow, you... You don't look the same. Well, I mean... Well, of course you don't look the same. - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh, wow, oh, I am so sorry about that, I apologize, the snowball-- Is that your go-to opener, just kind of launch a snowball at somebody? Is that how you roll? No, I was just trying to get your attention, to ask what you were doing here. I was just taking out the tractor, a little winter maintenance. Right. No, I know what you were doing, it's just, what you were doing here, on this farm. Oh, no, I work here on this farm. Last few years, I've been working here with Randall. - Oh. - Yeah. Actually, co-running it pretty much. I stay right there in the guest cottage, I live here. Yeah, I've been just kind of keeping an eye on the place, he asked me to, until the new owner figured out what they're gonna do with it, which... Which I'm guessing is you? - Yeah. Temporarily, anyway. Alright. Um, you gotta be freezing, let's get you in the house-- Oh no, no, no. You know what? No, I can do it, you're fine, you just do whatever you were doing, I know you've got a lot of work to do, I'm sure. I will... go in and get myself settled, no problem. Absolutely. Of course. Yeah, you go get... acclimated to being back and then, I'll just come by in the morning and I'll tell you everything you need to know about the farm and... I don't know, maybe we'll grab a bite to eat or something. Oh, the... That would be great, thank you. Alright, well, I'll be in the workshop if you need me, you just... Yeah, just knock. Snowball not required. No, no, of course, yeah. No more snowballs, I promise. Alright, well... Good to see you again. Yeah. Yeah, really good seeing you too. Yeah. Bye. My darling Janie, I imagine you must be pretty confused right now. "Why would Randall leave me his farm?" Well, I'll tell you. In the years I've lived here, I never saw anyone light up at this place more than you did. I know you haven't seen it much since you've grown and made your way in the world, but there's never been a doubt in my mind, the farm belongs to you. I know it's unlikely you'll decide to keep it, if anyone knows how difficult it is to run this place, it's yours truly. But I do have a favour to ask you. I'd love to see the old barn host Winter Wonderland one last time and give this beloved town tradition the send off it deserves. It's a lot to ask, and I know you're so busy, but if you have the time and inclination to stay through Christmas and help make it happen, it will mean a lot. Know that I am very proud of you and the person you have become. Whatever you decide, I understand. With love, Randall. Hey! I was hoping I'd here from you. I'm sorry, I missed your call earlier, I've been in meetings all day. That's okay, I was just wanting to let you know I made it here in one piece. I miss you today... I'm actually at your place right now, dropping off an early present. - You are? - I am. It is a postmodern Christmas tree. Well, that's very festive. No, I thought you might like a little holiday cheer when you get back in a couple of days. Uh, yeah, well... about that, I don't know exactly when I'm gonna be back. Really? Is everything okay? Yeah, no, no, no, it's fine, it's just that... Well, Randall left me something. Something big. What? Like a horse? No, like the farm. - The farm? The whole thing? - Yeah. Okay, uh, so what are you gonna do? I mean, I'll tell you what I'm thinking, I'm thinking I can't run a farm from 200 miles away, right? You know, a fully functioning farm can sell for a lot of money, Janie. Yeah... Yes, there is that. But... there's also something else. You see, Randall left me this letter, and in the letter, he asked me if I could put on the town festival. A festival? Yeah, he held it every year at his farm and it's called Winter Wonderland, and it's like this three-day Christmas market that the whole town participates in. It's kind of a big deal out here. Okay, so what does that mean? Well, uh... It would mean that I'd have to stay here until the festival is over, which is... Christmas Eve. Oh. So, LA... I know, I know. Listen, I know that you really wanted to go to LA, but... Look, I'm not saying I've made up my mind, I'm just thinking out loud. Um... Hey, I actually have to run, I'm meeting Bill for drinks. - No, wait a minute, hold on-- - I'm fine. Look, a couple of days on the farm, you'll be dreaming for a real vacation, I'm not too worried. Okay. I love you. I'll talk to you soon. So, how's it feel being back? Strangely familiar. Though definitely different from Manhattan. Yeah, well, I bet. Randall mentioned that you ended up there, not too far from home. Yeah... Yeah, but it feels like a different planet. You know, the culture, the architecture, the food, the energy, everything. Well, I don't know about the culture, but the eating here is pretty good, case in point. - Oh. Is this the old Pit Stop? - Yeah! Oh, yeah, Randall and I used to come here every Saturday morning, we used to... we used to get the short stack. Wow, good memory. Unfortunately, there's not as many greasy diners in Woodland Falls as there used to be, but the food here is so good, you're gonna love it. Thank you. Hope you're hungry. You're right, food's incredible. Aw, good, I'm glad. I'm glad you like it. I mean, you should be here during harvest, because that's when it's... it's literally farm to table. It's even better, if you can believe it. What? No, nothing, it's just that... I don't know, this is a little funny for me, you know, I haven't seen you since I was ten years old and here we sit, just chatting away like old friends. Hmm. Yeah. I mean, we are kind of old. Hey, no, no, no, don't put me in that category. No, all I mean is you're just easy to talk to. - Huh. - Yeah. That's really nice of you to say, thank you. Can I ask your advice on something? Sure. So, Randall left me this letter, and in the letter, he asks me to put on Winter Wonderland this year. - Really? What do you mean? Well, you remember how big a deal Winter Wonderland is, right? Yeah, I mean, it's a festival. No, no, it's so much more than a festival. There's so many people, are you kidding me now? And not just because we're crazy about Christmas around here, but because... I mean, people really rely on it, you know, the tourists come in and they're buying the goods and they're shopping on Main Street, it's a real boost to the local economy every Holiday Season, Randall knew that, that's why he put it on every year. It's a lot of work, I know because I helped him do it, but I don't think people are really expecting it to happen so, if you go home and don't do it, you don't have to feel guilty about it. Except for the fact that I'm ignoring my great uncle's last wish. Hmm. Except for that. Yeah. Well, if you do decide to put it on, um... I'd be happy to help you. Thank you, I appreciate that. Just think about it for a little while, and not too long, 'cause there's like, about a week left to throw it all together, so. Oh. No pressure, right? Whatever you decide, I understand. You've reached Charles. Leave a message and I'll hit you back. Hey. It's me. Uh, I know that you're probably working, but I just had to say something, and I know this means cancelling LA and I'm sorry, and I hope that you understand, but... I'm gonna stay here for Christmas and I'm gonna put on Winter Wonderland. Janie, what do you mean you're staying? I know this ruins your plans and I'm sorry, but it's important. I don't understand. Why do you have to stay, can't someone else do it? No, Charles. He asked me to. Besides, why don't you just cancel your reservation, you can come down here, it'll be fun. It's too late to cancel. Also, I set up a few meetings out there. Trying to expand my client base. And there's the real reason. So, is it safe to assume that you are still going? I have to. You know, Charles, I don't understand why you can't come down here with me, but yet you can take a big trip to California? Look, I'll be in LA for a week. If you come to your senses, there's a room waiting for you. Okay. Alright Charles, I'll talk to you later. Hey, city girl! Oh, hi. Didn't even see you there. How are you settling in? Are you uh... You need anything? Uh, well, I was actually just gonna come over and talk to you, just to-- Wow, that's... strong. Uh... No, I was actually gonna come over and talk to you later and just tell you that... I've decided I'm gonna stay. Yeah, I'm gonna put on Winter Wonderland. - Are you serious? - Yeah. That's fantastic! I'm so happy to hear that, I was really hoping that you would. Oh, well, can't really let down Randall and the entire rest of the town, apparently. So, you... you said that you have some experience putting this thing on? - Every Christmas since I've been working with Randall. Um, great. Great. Well, where do I start? Come with me. Aren't you cold? Come on in here. Ooh. It's not quite as... magical as I remember it. Well, that's because it's usually cleared out by now. That's the first order of business, we've gotta clean this place up. Right yeah. Yeah. Then we gotta decorate. And we've gotta set the vendors' stands up, not to mention the petting zoo and the carnival games, we gotta hire a Santa. - Wow, okay, that's... that's a lot. It's really grown that much, huh? Oh, every Christmas it gets bigger and bigger. You're not feeling in over your head already, are you? No, not at all. Everything is manageable with a plan in place, we just have to follow it step by step, and the first step is letting everybody know that the festival is on. Yeah. Absolutely. That was Randall's area of expertise, so I'm not exactly sure how much I can help you with that. No, no, no, it's totally fine. This is what I do, trust me. - Ah. - However, I may need your help, because I'd like to get a few more photos for the festival to post online. Oh. Yeah, yeah, my sister could help with that. Nicole's got like albums full of photos from years past and I'm heading over to her house tonight for dinner. - She still lives here? - Yeah. You should come tonight. - I would love to see Nicole. Yes, I am in. - Great. There's a bit of snow here. - Oh! - Whew! - Oh, no! I have heels on. Careful. There you go. - Thank you. Think they're gonna recognize me? Well, I kinda texted everybody and let 'em know you were coming, so don't be surprised if-- Janie Collins?! It is so good to see you! - You too! - Wow. Hey, brother. - Hey, hey. - Come on in! - Okay. I can't believe that you're a deputy! Yeah, so after high school, I went straight into the academy and I've been making Woodland Falls a safer place ever since. And clearly we need it, it's got one of the lowest crime rates in the county. But how do you think it got that way? Fair enough. Um, along the way, I married Rick and we had a kid. What, wait a minute. You married Rick?! - Yeah, we're still together. - Where is he? Well, he's on the road for work until Christmas, but he's working with Santa to bring back Gracie a special present to open on Christmas morning. - Oh, that's nice. - Yeah. So, what about you, Esther, are you still painting? I am. Mom opened up a gallery, right in town. - Really? - Yeah. I would love to see it before I leave. Oh, any time my dear, you come on by. So, what have you been up to all these years, Janie? Dylan mentioned that you're in the Big Apple now. Yeah, I am. I am. Uh, I am working for a company called Knit. We do marketing and brand management for products, place them with influencers, increase their online presence, things like that. I have no idea what most of that means, but it sounds really interesting. Oh, it is, it is, I promise. It's stressful and there's not a lot of downtime, but it is what it is, I just wish I could pick the products that I try to sell. I mean, trying to sell energy drinks, sometimes it's not that fun. Well, I hear that you are putting on the Winter Wonderland this year. And I cannot tell you how much the town is going to appreciate that. Yeah, Dylan said you need pictures? I mean, I have tons. Why don't we go through the album after we're done eating? - That sounds great. - Great. Okay. - This looks amazing. Thank you so much. - Enjoy everybody. - Yes! - Okay. Well? Two full days back, what do you think? It was great. Great. I mean, it's hard to beat Christmas in Woodland Falls. - Right? - Yeah, I'll admit that. I mean, you should give the rest of the year a shot. Fall here is so spectacular. You probably don't even remember that, do you? Plus, you could help out with the harvest. [{I mean, assuming you don't sell the farm. Obviously. - Right. Uh, you know, I want to be completely transparent here, I did ask Sidney to put the farm up for sale. Well, um... I kind of thought it was just a matter of time, I guess anyways. Hm. But it's not like we're saying goodbye. You know, we're still gonna do the festival. Yeah, no, no, no. Of course not. No. Um-- - Great. Well, I should probably get to bed, because we still have tons of work left. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Me too, me too. Good night. - Good night. Oh. Ooh. Good morning. Good morning. You look, um, tired. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I was up all night working on posts for Winter Wonderland. Come on in. Okay. Yeah, close the door. Close the door. What is this? Oh, I had to do a little grocery shopping for myself this morning, I figured Randall's fridge was still pretty bare, so I got you some groceries while I was at it. - That's sweet. - Yeah. No problem. I also got you some great stuff from the farm. Aw. Now this brings back memories. You know, Randall used to walk me around this farm. He taught me how to do everything. And I am embarrassed to say I can't remember how to do any of it. I can show you a few things if you want. I'm not doing your chores for you. I would never ask you to do that, but you do happen to own the place, albeit temporarily. Hm. You might enjoy it. Plus, the sooner I finish my chores, the sooner I can help you with Winter Wonderland. Yeah, there it is, there it is, quid-pro-quo. Yeah, something like that. Okay. Alright, well, what's first? We start by you getting dressed. Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry, I'll be right back. Okay. I can't thank you enough Earl, honestly, your trees are always just so beautiful. But this one has to be the best tree ever, it really does. Well, we always save the best for Randall. Hi. Hey, Janie, come here. Meet Earl. Earl's family has the Christmas tree lot across town. Everybody in Woodland Falls, I mean, everybody buys their trees from this man and his family at the Wyatt Farm. Yeah, the Wyatts. I remember you guys, didn't you sell honey? Oh, we're still doing the honey. But when my daughter Julie got married, we expanded the operation a bit. Nice. Well, it's nice to see you again. You too. Seriously though, folks are awfully happy to hear the Winter Wonderland is back on. It's a big part of this town, something we really can't afford to lose. The fact that it's good for business doesn't hurt. Yeah, I hear that. I'm glad it's helping. - Hey, Earl. You guys ever thought about having a second location? Here you go. Need any help with that? I got it, what are you talking about? - Ah! - This is a tree. This is a tree. Right here okay? - Yeah, that's fine. - Okay. Oh, here. Let me move these boxes. What do you think? That's the spot. Right there for sure, yeah. Hey, that was a really nice thing that you did for Earl, I gotta say. Can I have some scissors? - Yeah. He's probably gonna sell twice as many trees when people show up at Winter Wonderland, they see a whole forest of Christmas trees out there. It's just good for business. Plus, it means more traffic for both of us and we have this pretty little display of Christmas trees right in front of the barn, all free of charge. Thank you very much. You actually made a profit on the deal, somehow when they gave you this tree. Well, what can I say, I'm a genius. You do have a good head for it, you would make a decent farmer. What? I'm serious! People think it's just like waking up at the crack of dawn and doing some heavy lifting or whatever, but you need to have a good business sense and you do. And by the way, I gotta say, you're not as useless at farm work as I thought you'd be. Thank you? I guess you can't take the farm out of the girl. No. This work, yes, it is exhausting. But I don't know, I'm really enjoying it, and it's... somehow satisfying. That looks great. - That's a nice tree. It's a good tree, it's... It's not a Christmas tree yet. Hmm. You know what? There's some boxes in the basement labelled "Christmas". I mean, the tree needs some love. I'll go check. I can't believe you've been here an entire week and you're just putting up the Christmas tree now. Well, in my defence, I mean, I was only supposed to be here a few days. Well lucky for us, those plans fell through. Man, that's pretty perfect. Yeah, it is. Here you go. Thanks. Hey, um, have you heard from Sidney about selling? Oh, I'm actually supposed to meet with him tomorrow. You know, I'm hoping that we find a really good buyer. Oh, I hope so. I mean, Randall would have loved to keep this farm up and running, he really would have. I don't know why he gave it to me, I mean, I haven't stepped foot on a farm in like 20 years. Um, but listen, I am being serious about it, because I know that your home and your job is all tied up in what happens to this place, so. - Yeah, no, I know. - Yeah. Still, I just don't know why he gave it to me. Of all people. - Wait. Really? You don't? - No, I don't. - He was crazy about you, Janie, he talked about you all the time. - He did? - Yes, he was... He was so proud of you. I mean, I know you only lived here for 10 years, but those 10 years that you spent visiting him at the farm were... They were like everything to him. I think you were the closest thing to a daughter he ever had. Oh. It's Charles. You, um... you gonna answer that? I haven't decided yet. That doesn't sound good. Well, it's just that... The last time we spoke, things got a little... strange. And, yeah. Uh, you know what? I should probably call him back. Yeah. Right. I'll... I'll head out, leave you to it. Um, hey. It's been really nice reconnecting with you. Yeah. It has. And thanks for the tree, I love it. Good. I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. - Okay. Bye. Bye. Wow. Janie, this is such a good idea. - Thank you. - I can't believe Randall never thought to do it, it just seems so obvious now. What about this one, Mom? Oh, Gracie, that's perfect. Is that the one you want? You sure? Okay, I'll ring it up. Mrs. Wyatt. We can ring up a six-foot tree for 50 bucks. No way. Mrs. Wyatt, you can't keep giving away free trees, it's bad for your business. Please call me Marjorie. And there is no way I'm gonna make a deputy pay for a Christmas tree. Especially when she's your best friend, Janie. And anyway, the trees are my son-in-law's business. Earl and I make our money selling honey. That's right. You know what? I have still yet to try your honey. In fact, you know what? Dylan should be back any minute, he's probably got some on his truck. Well you don't have to wait till then dear, I brought some with me... ...for my lunch. - Ooh. Now, you just give me your hand. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. Oh. Hmm! Marjorie, dare I say that might be the best honey that I have ever had? Oh, that's our Apple Blossom, it's one of my favourites. But just you wait till you try the Rosemary. We've been perfecting that recipe for 30 years. It's all natural, mind you. Wait a minute, it tastes like this and it's organic? Yeah. Okay, so, why don't you sell this in health food stores? We don't get too far out of Woodland Falls. But that's just fine with me, because I get to see the joy on people's faces as they taste it. And you can't put a price on that. Yeah. I guess you're right. Oh, there's uncle Dylan. - Hey, hey! - Uncle Dylan, look at my tree! That is a beauty! Whew! Okay, here you go. - Hey there. - Hey. - How'd it go? Great, great. I feel like I saw half the town this morning. That's just the first load. - Wow. - Uncle Dylan! Is the petting zoo ready? As a matter of fact, the last animals were dropped off this morning, the only problem is we're looking for somebody to give them all a nice warm welcome, but... - Hmm... - Who could do that? - I don't know. Mom, can we? Please? I suppose I ought to make sure these animals aren't ferocious. - Yay! - You wanna come? I was just gonna actually... I was gonna check out the barn-- Yeah, no, I don't think so. No. Just keep walking. There they are! - Careful! Gracie! Bring some food, let's feed the camels. Aw, look, it's so cute. Hi! - Aren't they so cute? Yes. Aw. So, how have you enjoyed being back? Oh, it's been amazing, yeah. I have to say, I have loved putting on this festival and being here on the farm, working with Dylan, it's just... It feels like for once, I'm doing something that matters. - Yeah, because you are. - Yeah, I know. And then... there's Charles. And I mean, we get along. Most of the time. I guess it can't be butterflies all the time, right? Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that this trip has just opened my eyes, you know? And maybe, when I get back to New York City, I'll be able to see things a little more clearly. Yeah, yeah. I hope so. So, you want my two cents? Hmm. I don't think it gets much clearer than Woodland Falls on a starry night. How's it going over there, city girl? Good. These guys are hungry. - You're very popular. Look at that. Ah! Ah! Oh my gosh. They can tell you're from New York. - Here you go. - Here you go. - Okay, alright Gracie. - Wow. Wait until you see all of this... - Look at this! - Look at this, this is your grandma's paintings. And we've got some hand-made originals right over here. That's right. And we got Wyatt's honey. Oh, so much more too. Wow, Mom, look at all the cookies! Wow, Gracie. Hey, speaking of cookies, don't we have a special project we need to get home to? Yeah, yeah. We do. But you'll be back tomorrow to help finish setting up, right? - We'll be here. - You better. Okay. - Good night you two. - Good night. - Bye Gracie. - Bye! Now, as nice as this looks, there's something else I want to show you. Upstairs? Finally! I get to see it? Let's go. Close your eyes at the top of the stairs, though. Okay. Hey, hey, alright. You can't see, right? You can't see through my fingers right now? I can't see, that's why I'm walking like this. - Am I going too fast? - No, you're okay now. - Alright. Okay, stop here. - Okay. Perfect. Now I'm gonna take my hand... Well, no, I don't want you to open it. I'm gonna take my hand away, don't open your eyes, promise? - Yes. - Okay. Um, alright. So, I'm gonna be right back-- Wait a minute, where are you going? I'll be right back, you're safe. It's fine. And I'm gonna count to three, when I count to three, um, you're gonna open your eyes. Okay? On three. - Okay. Ready? One, two... ...three. Dylan... I can't believe this, this is incredible. Did you do this all by yourself? Yeah. Yeah, I just kind of kept it a secret and wanted to surprise you. - Wow. - You like it? - Yes. I love it. Of course I forgot the radio was on-- - Oh! - Let me just, uh-- Oh, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait. Oh, that song. Randall and I used to dance to it when I was a little girl. Hmm. And he used to tell me it was our song. Hey. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay I just... I miss him. Hmm. Well, obviously, I'm not half the dancer Randall was, but... I'd really love to fill in, if you'd have me. Yeah. That would be nice. I think we should go unload the truck. But you did a really good job in here. Hmm. Thanks. And thank you for the dance. How'd I do? You're not as good as Randall, but... Hey, Marjorie! Didn't Dylan already do a pickup for you? How much honey do you have? Well, 30 years' worth. Thought I'd bring just a few more. You should see the cellar! Might as well live in a hive. Uh, can you take those to the booth for me, please? Yeah, I think I can handle that. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Hey, hon. - Hmm! Wow! The place looks great, Janie. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Hey, are you ready to play Santa tomorrow? Oh, you bet. Luckily, I fit the part. I got the belly of a man who stopped farming but kept eating honey. Spitting image. Oh, we'd better go help Dylan set up. - Shall we? - Mm-hmm! Bye. Hey, what's wrong? Well... Poor Gracie spent all day yesterday making cookies. She wanted to sell them to raise money for school, only... They're disgusting. Well, I mean, I'm sure they're not that bad. May I? I knew it! No, we can fix it. No, we can't! Mom already tried helping me and look what happened! I think I made things worse. I can barely boil water. Right. I know what we're gonna do. We're gonna start over and we are gonna make the best cookies you have ever tasted in your entire life. Okay! This batch is cooled, I think it's time for a taste test. Ooh, ooh, ooh! - Right. - Thank you. Ready? Hmm! Hmm. Now, that's a cookie. You know what we call them? Do you remember? I don't. Friendship cookies. Oh, right, friendship cookies! I'm gonna make so much money for school! Yes, you are! Janie, you in there? Yeah, door's open. Oh! Excuse me. - Sorry. Whoa! You guys have been busy. So, how's everything coming along at the barn? Good. Starting to wind down, but pretty much ready for tomorrow. Uncle Dylan, come try one. Yes! Yes. Hmm! So good. And by the way, exactly how I remember them. You don't remember them. I do so! Oh, really? What are they called? You don't think I know. No. Friendship cookies. Okay, I'm impressed. Yeah. I love these, you kidding me? So good. Oh, it's Mom. Just give me one second. Hmm! Oh! Put me to work, what can I do? You could roll out some more dough. Yeah, I can. Absolutely. Bring in the muscle to roll out the dough, I see how it is over here. Can I eat the dough? Mom says it gives you worms. I will not be eating the dough. Okay, good news. Just got off the phone with Mom. She has some old paintings to donate to Winter Wonderland. - Great! - Yeah, and apparently, you didn't answer her text? I did forget that, didn't I? Mm-hmm. Anyways, she wants someone to swing by the gallery tonight to pick them up. Okay, I'll fire up the truck. Unless you want to go? Oh, we still have these cookies to decorate. I can handle the cookies, you take a break. You know, I could go with you. I'd love to see your gallery anyway. We can make it a fun girl's night out. You know, that does sound kind of nice. Okay! I mean, I'd be crazy to turn down free babysitting. Thank you! - You're welcome. Bye, honey. Alright, let's go before he changes his mind. Let's go! Bye! That did not take long, that decision. Alright, you and me, you ready? Alright, what shape? - Candy cane. - Candy canes. Oh! This is great, Esther, I can't believe you painted all of these. Yeah, it's a couple of decades' worth. Yeah, but I've been meaning to clear up more space in the gallery for a while now. The gallery only features work from local artists. Mom loves to give them a home. I think that is great. Are any of these your favourite? Ooh! Well... This one. Oh... That's beautiful. Thank you. I finished it about a week before you arrived. Where I painted it isn't far from your farm. Really? Yeah. Well, I suppose I should start arranging things in the booth. Would you girls bring the rest of them in? Right behind you, Mom. And I'll bet you thought this town had no culture. This is nice. Oh, it is. You know, I can't remember the last time I went out with a friend. Oh! Me neither. - Really? - Yes! You know, I guess it's my fault. I haven't really made time for friends. Well, thank you for making the time for me. This has been so nice. Oh, it's my pleasure. Although, you should really be thanking Dylan, because he's watching Gracie. Yeah! Yeah, he's okay, I guess. For an annoying older brother. He seems like he's really good with kids though. Yeah, yeah, he is. Nice. Have you ever thought about having kids at all? Uh... I mean, yeah. Yeah, definitely thought about it. And I am approaching the age at which it gets a little bit more pressing. Right. And then, there's moments like today, when I'm baking cookies with Gracie and I remember all those moments with Randall and I think, "Yeah, that's exactly what I want." I see it so clearly. And what does Charles want? Oh. I think he doesn't want to talk about it. And he always changes the subject and turns it back to our careers and how much it costs and... I don't know, maybe it's a moot point. Well, it shouldn't be. I mean, it's something you want. It should at least be an option, right? Hmm. Janie, you deserve to have the life you want. Wherever that is. Good morning! You're just gonna stand there or you're gonna have some breakfast? I'm sorry, I just need a moment to process the fact that you actually got up before me. Making sure I wasn't dreaming. Uh, this is what you dream about? Ah! I have to tell you, I had the best sleep that I've ever had. Like, in my entire life. Because you've been working so hard! It finally caught up to you. Oh, I don't know. I think it's more than that. I think it's... when you spend your day doing something meaningful, you just... you just sleep better. You know, for instance, I would never be able to do this in New York. It's just go, go, go. In fact, I don't even eat breakfast. And somehow, this just seems... natural for me. Hey! Any interest in checking the moisture levels of the grain silos with me? Uh... Now, that does sound like fun. Uh, but I have a better idea. Why don't you have breakfast with me? Consider it like the calm before the storm. Hmm. Grain silos can probably wait. I honestly don't think the first day of Winter Wonderland has ever had such an incredible turnout. It is! It's incredible. No, I mean, Winter Wonderland is incredible. You just had to spread the word a little more effectively. Hmm. Oh, speaking of spreading the word. I think Marjorie needs a little help. I'll be right back. Yeah, you go work your magic. Morning, Marjorie! How are you doing? Hi, Janie. I'm doing good. Having a bit of a slow start. - Oh. Must be too early in the day for honey. Oh, no, it's never too early in the day for honey. It'll pick up soon. Yeah. Do you mind if I expedite things a little bit? No, I suppose not. But please don't go to any trouble on my account. Oh no, no trouble. Hey. Hey, do you have any crackers or something like a baguette or something you can just cut up for me really fast? Yeah, I can put something together. Sure. Oh, Marjorie. Mm-hmm? Okay, can you put some honey on this cracker for me? Load it up. Wow! Okay. There you go. Mm! Mm! Oh! Is that rosemary honey? Oh yes, it's one of our specialties. Oh! It's incredible. This rosemary honey is just... Oh! How are you doing? You should try this. Get in there. Oh, yes. Try them all, in fact. Oh. Oh, wow. You're not kidding. And this is rosemary? Yes, and that's Apple Blossom, Clover and Lilac. You guys should try this. Okay, uh... That was really, really impressive. I mean, I didn't do anything. She has a really great product. Basically sells itself. I guess it's easy to market something when you love it. Don't you sell yourself short. Look at her. Look, she's so happy, she's busy now. And by the way, she deserved it. You're gonna let yourself feel good about that. All in all, I'd say that was a pretty good first day. Pretty good first day? That was the best first day of Winter Wonderland I've ever been to. And tomorrow, it's gonna be even better. You... did amazing. I'm not... It's not just me, this was a group effort. The town, you guys, especially you. Hmm. Well, I don't know about you guys, but I need to get home. Yeah, me too. So, I'll see you guys tomorrow? - Absolutely. - Okay. Great job, today. - Good night. - Night! So... Seems like you had a pretty good day today. Oh yeah? And what is that supposed to mean? Nothing! Nothing, no. Just, well, you and Janie were basically joined at the hip, and not just today. It's been like that for a week now. I am just doing my job. Tough to avoid, living on the farm. Oh, it's not what I mean and you know it. What's going on between you two? Nothing! Oh, Dylan, come on! You're my brother. I know when you like someone. And Janie, I mean... There's never been a Janie before. No. There really hasn't. But in two days, it's gonna be Christmas Eve and the festival will be over and Janie will be on her way back to Manhattan, so... And you're fine with that? What am I supposed to do about it? What, am I supposed to get her to stay here and keep the farm? Okay, well, what's the alternative? You say nothing and then probably never see her again? Dylan, you have two more days with her. Do you really want them to be your last? I know it's a little kitschy. Oh! Charles! Sorry. The door was unlocked, I let myself in. What are you doing here? I know I should have called. But after our last talk, I decided I didn't want to wait so long to see you again. So, I cut the trip short and booked a flight up here. Are you happy to see me? Yes, of course I'm happy to see you. I'm just... I'm surprised. Well, if you think that's a surprise, wait until you see this. What is this? That's an offer. For the farm. What? You're not gonna believe this. One of the guys I met in LA is a developer. He builds condo developments all over the country. I happen to show him your post about Winter Wonderland and the real estate listing, and he said it was interesting. Ah! Is that the right number? Yeah. Way above asking. He's highly motivated. That's a cash offer, Janie. He's looking to move ASAP. Wow. Uh, sorry, this is just... It's a lot to take in. I know, right? Yeah. We should get this over to Randall's lawyer first thing in the morning, have him have a look at it. Um... I... Do you think I could just have a little bit of time to think about it? Uh, sure. Yeah, of course. But I mean, this is what you came here for. Right? To sell the farm, get Randall's things in order. Except for finishing the festival, which I am totally willing to stay for, by the way. Your work her is done. Okay. You're right. This is a lot to process. You've had a big day with the whole Wonderland thing. Hey. When don't you sleep on it, yeah? I'm sure in the light of day, things will be clear. And then, we can finally get back to our lives. You want a tea? Yeah, thank you. Oh, hey! We got a couple more boxes that just arrived, okay? There you are! I've been trying to call you. Yeah, I was just... I was getting a little worried. I mean, missing out on some farm work is one thing, but when you were late coming here... Everything okay? Yeah, yeah, I just need to talk to you for a minute. Me too, actually. So, come with me. First, you have to open this. Okay, Dylan-- I know it's a couple of days early, I get that, but it's really gonna help illustrate what I have to say to you. But I really need to tell you that-- - There you are. - Hi. Hot apple cider, as requested. Thank you. Um... Charles, this is Dylan. Dylan, this is Charles. Dylan works on the farm and he's really helped me put together Winter Wonderland. Oh, great. Nice to meet you, Dylan. Well done with everything. It's... beautiful. Must be bittersweet though, huh? One last hurrah. You know, bittersweet is actually a really good word for it, yeah. Charles, do you mind if I speak with Dylan in private really quickly? We just need to discuss some farm things and I'll be right back. Yeah, sure. I'll hang out here. Sure. What do you think? Is this... Is this happening? Well, I don't know. I just got the offer yesterday from Charles. Trust me, I didn't sleep all night thinking about it. This is... This is for condo development. Look, I know it's not ideal. You know, and that it puts you in a bit of an awkward position with your job and your cottage. Janie, I'm not thinking about me here, I'm thinking about you. Is this really what you want? Well, let's be realistic here. I think it was always a long shot that I was gonna run a farm. You know, I think even Randall knew that. But cashing out like this, do you really think this is what Randall wanted? Hold on, cashing out? No, wait a minute. I didn't ask for this farm to be just dropped in my lap. It actually really complicated my life. I was perfectly happy in New York before any of this. Are you saying that you haven't been happy since you've been back? Are you saying that you haven't felt anything... here? It's not that simple. You know what, you're right. This is... This is your decision, I got no right. I got no right to be like this, I really don't. I know you're really interested to get back to New York, I understand that. So... Don't worry about the festival, because I can finish that up myself. - I can help you... - No, I'm serious, Janie. I'm serious. Really, don't feel badly about this. You go. You can go home. Come and get your cookies! Do you want some cookies? Janie, look how many cookies we sold! Hi! Is everything okay? Yeah, I just have to leave. Oh, that's alright, Dylan can help us pack up later, but see you tomorrow, right? Oh. Where are you going? Well... I just got to go home, but I live close from here. So, I'll come back and see you, alright? Promise? Yeah. Come here. Sell a ton of cookies, okay? You... I miss my friend, okay? So, we need to keep in touch. Don't worry, I won't let you get away again. Remember, I'm the deputy, I can find you. Come here. Call me when you get home, okay? Okay. Bye, Gracie. Bye. Alright. That ought to do it, Miss Collins. You're no longer the owner of Collins Farms. You know, the deadline for getting this to the buyer isn't until January 1st. If you like, I could take my sweet time making a visit to the post office. No. Make the deal. Alright. Well, then it was a pleasure doing business with you Miss Collins, hope we see each other again soon. You too, Sidney. Take care. - Bye-bye. - Bye. Yeah. Talk then. I take it you don't want a cappuccino. No. Keeping you... I would like the peace and quiet I had at the farm. Shoes off, please. How very Zen of you. I just wanted to swing by on my way to work, say hi. I brought you breakfast. I'm starving. It's a yogurt bowl with Chia seeds and blueberries. Healthy. Hey, do you have any plans today? Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna stop by the office and see what I missed. You know, I was thinking of grabbing lunch at that Thai place around the corner. You want to meet back here say, one? Yeah. Yeah? Alright. I'm off. I'll see you soon. Thanks for the... Hey, Frank! Thanks for returning the call. Ooh, whoa there, son! Where are you off to in such a hurry? I'm sorry, Sidney, I lost track of time, I got to go open Winter Wonderland. I've just been... I've just been a little distracted lately. I understand. Lot of changes coming your way soon. I was actually about to drop Janie's paperwork in the mail. All I could tell you, it was not an easy decision for her to make. I know, I know, it's just, the thought of her running a farm, it was a bit of a long shot anyway. I just... I really hope that she doesn't regret it. You know? Well, anyway, I got to get going. - See you soon. - See you soon. This is a big one, Janie. Dinosaur's a premium client. And this new line of drinks is hoping to expand into a completely untapped market. Kids? A whole new set of flavours aimed directly at kids. So, I guess juice boxes are going extinct, huh? Oh, that is why you were on this account! I am gonna pitch that as a possible tagline to build. What's wrong? I thought you'd be over the moon about this. Yeah, no, I'm fine, I'm just... getting acclimated to being back, that's all. Of course. Go have a good Christmas Eve. The little dinos will be waiting for you. Yeah. "Janie, whatever you decide, I know Randall's proud of you. I hope this helps you remember the best Winter Wonderland Woodland Falls has ever seen. Merry Christmas, Dylan." Honey. Hey, sorry I'm late. Ready to go? What's all this? Uh... It's a Christmas gift from Dylan. That bad, huh? No, actually, it's... It's perfect. Charles, would you come sit by me, please? You know what, if it's alright by you... I'm gonna stay here. Okay. Charles, I need to be honest with you. I got to be honest with me. Three years ago, when I moved here to the city, I loved this place. I loved hanging out with you, working for Elle, the hustle and bustle of it all, it just... It fuelled me. But I think it's that pace that didn't allow me to see that... None of that is making me happy anymore. And it wasn't until I got back to Randall's farm I understood that... ...that's what makes me happy. And I respect you, I do, I respect your work ethic and I don't want to change you, because I know that someday, some woman is gonna come and she's gonna want to do all of the things that you want to do and be your partner. But that's not me. I'm moving back to Woodland Falls. Throw away your career, become a farmer? Maybe, I don't know. But I don't feel like I'm throwing away anything. I just... I'm rebranding. You've been pulling away for a while now. I don't want to change you either, Janie. Go on, get out of here. If you're lucky, you might be able to get the farm back. Thank you, Charles. Yeah. You've reached the law offices of Sydney Reynolds, Esquire. Apologies for missing your call, but leave a detailed message and I'll return it as soon as I'm able. Thank you. Hi Sidney, it's Janie, again. Please do not mail those papers. Repeat, do not mail those papers. Thank you, bye. What? Oh, you serious? I don't have time for this. Where's the registration? Oh, where is it? You have any idea how fast you were going? Oh, Nicole! What are you doing back here? I know I never should have left, I don't know what I was thinking. It just took me going all the way back to New York City to finally figure out it doesn't feel like home anymore. Are you saying that Woodland Falls does feel like home? Yeah. And look, I know I was speeding and I'm sorry, but I'm just trying to make it to Winter Wonderland before it closes, because... I need to speak to Dylan. I mean, I could let you off with a warning. And it'd be a real shame for you to come all this way just to get there too late. And I do have a responsibility to serve and protect my community. Okay. - You need a police escort? - Yes! That's what I thought. Thank you! Love you! Merry Christmas. Uncle Dylan, look, there's no more cookies! We're sold out! Hey, are you okay? I'm so sorry. Are you still thinking about Janie? No! No, of course not. I was just thinking about all the... Yeah. I was still thinking about Janie. It's okay, Uncle Dylan, it's okay. You're the best. Oh! There's the official end of another Winter Wonderland. You were amazing! Ladies and gentlemen, can I... Can I have your attention, please? You all look so fantastic, you really do, I love seeing the smiles on your faces. Thank you so much for coming and supporting another Winter Wonderland! So many of us have had so many memories coming here year after year and we're gonna hold on to those memories really... in our hearts. Because unfortunately, this year... Dylan! Dylan. Hold on, excuse me. So sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hi. Um, can I borrow that? - Hi. - Hi. - Yeah. - Do you mind... Thank you. Oh, and here. Just hold that, don't open it. Hey. Hi, everybody. Uh, for those of you who may not know me, my name is Janie Collins and this farm was my great-uncle Randall's. And he loved Winter Wonderland. So, I just wanted to take a moment just to say thank you to all of the residents of Woodland Falls and to all of you visitors, because we can't do this without you. So, thank you. And you know, it might only happen just one time a year, but isn't it nice just to slow down and think about the things that are really important in life? And speaking about important, I have to say thank you to... someone that kept my great-uncle's dream alive and who helped me every step of the way, who loves this town more than anything and just made me realize how wonderful it is. How wonderful you all are. Thank you, Dylan. From the bottom of my heart. Alright, everyone. Well, I guess the only thing left to say is... Merry Christmas and I will see you all here next year for Winter Wonderland. I'm a little confused. I know, I know you must be. Guess you came back. Yeah. Yeah, because I went back to the city and... I thought about a lot. And I just, I thought about what I wanted my life to mean and then, I just... I realized that I've been living a lie. I mean, I don't do any of the things that truly make me feel good, you know? That make me happy. It's not until I came here to this farm and you know what? You... You were the one who helped me see that my life has all of this untapped potential. And I finally realized what I want in my life. And not only that, but who I want in my life. And I want to be on this farm. And I want to be here with you. Because you make me happy. Well, uh... There isn't anything that would make me happier than that. But I can't let you walk away from everything that you worked so hard on. Oh, no, no. Don't worry about that. I've thought about that. Just hear me out. So, I've always wanted to work for myself. And you know, I want to have clients that I'm proud of. So, I'm sure there are tons of people in Woodland Falls that could use my help. But I think the most important thing is I'm finally doing this on my terms. What... But what about the farm? Well, I just happen to have the best lawyer ever. Sidney didn't turn in the papers. Because someone tipped him off that I might regret it one day, so... Huh. But I think the most important thing is that I'm gonna be really busy, starting this new venture of mine. So, I'm gonna need someone to run the farm and I was just thinking that maybe, that person could be you. Nothing would make me happier. I think it's time you open that present. Show you how this works. Alright, we got us a farm! difuze
