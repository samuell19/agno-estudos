AN UNIMPORTANT STORY Subtitles: Translation MONIQUE & MICHEL COMTE Timing & English Proof TORRANCE Godasse, Godasse, all passengers off the train. I will not get the average this quarter. - You're not the only one. - You're still doing better. You bet? Anyway, the teacher can't stand me, so... I can't believe she sacks some one this way. Say, did you see what happened to Danny... when he was at the board the other day? Wasn't it straight sacking? Are you kidding? She can't remember anything. So, what should we do? Shall we play cards or not? - Yeah. - Let's do it. - Give me the cards. - Sure. - You deal? - Yes, you cut the deck. No fake hand, ok? Here comes Dany. - Hi. - Hi. - Good morning. - Hi. Still playing cards... Whose turn to call? You Philippe. No, I don't feel like playing. Shit, we can't play with just three. You could have stayed with me, really. I'm not going to be with you all the time. Jean is cool. I did not want to let him down. Little idiot. - Give me a bite? - No. You don't want to? If you want some, buy some. Otherwise you'll get even more puffed. Thanks. Count me out for your math exam tomorrow. Oh, you're a penny pincher. See you. Take that. And revise your lessons well. Thank you. I can count on you for tomorrow, ok? I'll bring some doughnuts! And strawberry ones. Listen, I have something important to tell you. Maybe he doesn't give a shit about me. We've got nothing in common. Jolly good. Morning. Morning. Georges-Henri. Jean-Fran?ois. Hi. Marc. Occupied. This seat is occupied. What about a game? Come up with a game. I know no game. You know no games, you know no jokes. What did you do when I was not here? Let's each of us write what we think on paper, ok? Ok. But let's swear to tell the truth. Ok, let's go. You really think so? It's a joke. I wanted to see your reaction. Silly you for inventing stupid games. And you? What did you come out with? I had nothing in mind so I wrote nothing. Goodbye gentlemen, thank you. Good evening. (kids singing) ...I lose my cap, my guitar, my gal... I want you. In such a world, declining, running away, schmuck... You see? It moves. - Doesn't it do it to you as well? - What? Well, this. Everytime I'm on a train, the motion of the train does this to me. I don't care. When I'm at the swimming pool... it gets all small. I can't even catch it. You can jerk off, can't you? I can't do it. Sometimes in shower I try but it doesn't work. Or in the toilets. Go see a doctor. One day I did. He put it in a machine and I could do it. You are bullshitting me. And at night, in your bed, when you dream, it never happens to you? Precisely, and then I wake up all messy. Weird. When I was your age I had been able to do it for a while. Since when? Don't know. Since always. No, three or four years. Show me how you do it? I can't simply show it to you. It can't be done like that. - Why not? - No, you have to think of someone... or something. How do I know? - I could get you in the mood? - Stop being stupid... or I'll kick your ass. We promised to tell everything to one another, to talk about everything. You know I don't tell anyone else. I can't do it here right now, nevertheless. - Why not? - No. You don't know? That's not the point. My mother could show up and you'll see. What would she say? I'm going to kick your ass. You want some more? Staying idle again. You'd better study. Claude, you'd better go home. Hi. Stop it. Stop it, I'm not a girl. - Give me a bite? - No. No, no. You don't want to. Goodbye. Refresh your lessons well I will think about you tomorrow. And strawberry ones, ok? I wish you a very good night. We meet again on Easter Monday. "I wish you a happy Easter and from tomorrow you will be... Tony you're sleeping. Go to bed. By the way, are you staying the night? Yes, please. And if Philippe agrees, you can manage to sleep together. So good night, boys. "And by the head of the coffin..." What a dumb movie. Let me finish. "Two silver candlesticks..." Oh, what a bore. Well, are there blankets? No. Move your legs. Move. So boy, how do we manage? What do you think? As you want. What a bore to make beds. If it was larger we could sleep together. It's a bore for both of us to get cold if we sleep on the floor. We can try to both sleep in the same bed. And if it doesn't work you can push me out. I won't push you out. Ok, let's try. We can not do it again. Beat it. I don't care. I did not come for you. At the time I was a kid, you taught things to me. You are so different. We'll never get along well. I always feel as if you are under a glass bell. I see you, but I can't reach you. I don't get sentences like that, so stop it. I feel like I'm changing deep inside me. You like only what I dislike in me. You think nothing over. We never talk. You think only of yourself. Yes, I guess that's it. But you don't know me. One should not always trust appearances. - I never say what I think. - That's easy. I don't want to discuss. I've got homework to do. Leave me alone. Ok, I will leave you alone. Let me play you a record. In such a world, declining, running away, schmuck... That's it, remind me who will stay. ...I lose my cap, my guitar, my gal, I'm fed up... Hurry, hurry. Get out if you can. Wait, wait. Have you seen that girl over there? - Yes. - Not bad, isn't she? Maybe. I don't know. Why maybe? She's nice, yes or no? Yeah, if you say so. You never look at girls. (girl) Let's think about the food too. Yes, I think she's nice. Want to go and see her? I don't know her. (girl) Let's remember to write to our parents. - You're nothing but a kid. - And you? What me? So have you made up your mind. Pass me the bottle of wine? You're going to drink this in one go. What in one go? - Come on. - What for? It might give you some confidence. Come on, drink I say. I don't feel like going. I don't feel like going, I tell you. You asleep? Move over. If you had seen that girl... I don't give a shit. Such nice skin. Let me sleep. You always sleep. I'm cold. Stop it now. Go nude. No. Go nude. No! Please. Stop or I shout. Go nude! Stop it! Shit. Shit! Shit! Do you think it's a pleasure to see such a face? Leave me alone. Is it Claude? Did you have an argument? It's nothing to do with Claude. I have other things on my mind. For days now you haven't been eating. You don't talk. I can't believe you are in love with him. Ah, pretty smart. I don't give a shit about him. I've got other concerns. So why this face? Oh please, leave me in peace. Hi, it's Philippe. I'd like to talk to Claude, please. Ah. Thanks. I've got your picture by me... Please don't forget me. You are comfortable? What are you thinking about? Little idiot. Stop, you are tickling me. - Hi. - Hi. Hey, there is Claude. Shall we go and see him? I see him enough. See you. I took a little moment of your life away from you. Philippe, supper is ready! I had to be of very little importance to him. He really must have despised me. Asshole. Egotist. Whore. No one cares about me. I don't want anything anymore. I'm a wreck. I hope it was worth your money.
