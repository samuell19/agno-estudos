Shame on you, Michaelis! I will deny anything that makes use ofblatant oversimplification. Truth is complex. Once you take away its character of complexity, you destroy it. And when truth is destroyed, you're building on sand. Fifteen years in a dark, damp underground cell. I still can't understand what it is we done wrong, Mother. Well, now, it's nothing like that, dear. Weren't you comfortable enough here? Was that it? I've purposely left you my few bits of good furniture. I don't see the use of leaving it till I'm dead. - Stevie? - Yes, Winnie? You go and do some of your drawing. I'll fetch you when it's time to bring the luggage down. All right, Winnie. What you want to say that for in front ofhim? You know how upset he gets if anyone talks about dying. Oh, I'm sorry, Winnie. I wasn't thinking. I'm all of a fluster. Is the cabbie here yet? ... the radical change we're all of us working towards. The revolution cannot be provoked. It must arise spontaneously... by the will of the people at the moment when it becomes clear to them... that capitalism is ready to collapse... under the weight of its own contradiction. Have you still not understood, Michaelis, that your damn pessimism... is a way of lying down and allowing the oppressor to march all over you? "Pessimism."If I were a pessimist... don't you suppose that sometimes in those 15 years... I would have found a way to cut my throat? I could've beaten my head in against the walls of my cell. No. I'm not advising a resignation or indifference. I am counseling patience! "Patience"...another word for doing nothing. You are saying that all action is useless. Worse than that. You are offering encouragement... to those economic cannibals... who drink the blood and feed on the flesh of the people. - Hear, hear. - No, no, no. Patience is not submission. It's a state of mind in which to complete the necessary preparations for the future. If I could find three men... three... capable of having no feeling for anything on earth... including themselves, then I could make the necessary preparations for the future. You cannot force what must happen of its own accord. Before long, the property owners... will begin to fight among themselves... And in the meantime they hold their branding irons against the skin of the people. We must hear it sizzle... and make no response... except for your damned patience... to the smell of burning... Stevie! What's the matter? Br... Br... Branding irons must hurt, Winnie! Think how they must hurt! Never mind that. The cab's here. Help Mother down with the luggage. It's gotta be stopped, Winnie! It's gotta be stopped! Come along. Don't you worry about it. Mr. Verloc will stop it. We're trying to conduct a meeting down here! Stop that fuss! Stop it! - Shh! - I'm so... - I'm... I'm s... I'm sorry, Mr. Verloc. - We're just leaving. Come on. Um, I'm, uh... I'm sorry, gentlemen. It's, uh... We'll take a short pause. My mother-in-law is moving out this evening. It's very good, this. Absolutely typical. What's very good? Exactly what you would expect from a degenerate. I wouldn't let my wife hear you call him that if I was you. She's very fond of her brother. - It's a purely scientific term. - Yeah. Thank you ever so much, Mr. Verloc. I'm sorry to have disturbed you. - Please allow me. - Mr. Michaelis. Mrs. Verloc. - I can manage, Mr. Ossipon. - Please, call me Tom. I thought your name was Alexander. It is, but all my most special friends call me Tom. Listen to me. Listen. You can come back anytime you wish. Oh, Mr. Verloc! You're so kind! Listen. Do me a favor, will you, young fella? Load the bags for me. Not supposed to do no liftin'. Well, go on, then. Is he all right... your brother? - He's a little upset today. - Oh. Upset. - I'm ever so grateful, Mr. Verloc. - No, no. Not at all. Tell her, Adolf. Nobody wanted her to go. What? Oh, oh. No, no. Of course not. Thank you. - I won't be long. - I'll get rid of them as soon as I can. - Safe journey. - Come on. Back to the meeting. - No, no. - Hey? - Don't whip. - Huh? - You mustn't whip. It hurts. - Mustn't whip, eh? Giddap! Hyah! Giddap! Hyah! Giddap! Giddap! Yaah! This is all your idea, Mother, so I don't know why you're carrying on. I can't help it, love. I'm sorry. You haven't quarreled with Mr. Verloc, have you? No, no. Of course not. Mr. Verloc's always been the soul of generosity. Then whatever is it decided you to leave us? I never could get used to that shop. I had to keep my eyes shut every time I passed through. It wasn't exactly the sort of place you could ask people back for a cup of tea, is it? It's a steady business. I don't know what your dad would've said. - Dad was a brute. - Winnie! Well, he was. He used to take it out on Stevie something terrible. Well, Stevie was a disappointment to him. He couldn't get used to the idea ofhaving a boy who was a bit, well... not quite right in the head. Well, taking his belt off to him wasn't gonna make him any cleverer, was it? Hup! Hey! - It's all right, Winnie. - You get back up this minute. No. It's all right, Winnie. It's all right. - No, I'll-I'll walk... I'll run after. - What are you talking about? - It's too heavy for the horse. - Run after a cab? I've never heard of such a thing. Don't you let him, Winnie. He'll get lost. I'll tell Mr. Verloc, Stevie. He'll be ever so unhappy. You been drinking? And don't you go for trying that again. - Poor horse. - Never mind the horse. How'd you like to sit up here at 2:00 in the morning, hey? See, I'm a night cabbie. Gotta take what they bloody well give me. Hanging out with all sorts in the middle of the night. Wife and four kids to keep. It's a hard world. It's bad. It's very bad. Hard on horses? Yeah, a damn sight harder... on poor bleeders like me. You can come in my bed if you like. And your horse as well. I'll ask Winnie. I-I'm doing this for Stevie. I wanted to be sure that he'd be safe. It's the same reason that you married Mr. Verloc, if the truth be known. - What do you mean? - Well, don't tell me you didn't prefer that butcher's boy. What was his name? Ron? Nice-looking boy. Liked to laugh. No. You wanted somebody who'd take care of Stevie. Mr. Verloc's always liked Stevie. Yeah, but he can be a bit of a burden at times. And now I'm getting on a bit, I was afraid I might be as well. - No. - Well... the best of men can get tired, dear. I didn't want him to get tired of Stevie. He'd have to get tired of me first. You will come and see me, won't you, Winnie, as often as you can? Course I will. I want to see you every Sunday. I'll come when I can manage, and when I can't, I'll send you Stevie. No! No, don't let him come on his own. He gonna change buses and get lost. You leave it to me. I'll... I'll work out something. Better go in, Mother. You'll catch cold out here. And you look after me on the way home. Help me into the bus. Mustn't be nervous, Winnie. I'll look after you. - It's a hard world, Winnie. - That's true enough. Hard on horses and for poor people. Nobody can do anything about that, Stevie. Yes. Police. That's not what the police are there for. Then... Then what are they there for, Winnie? The police are there so's them as have nothing... can't take nothing away from them as have a lot. Oh. What... What can they do if they're poor and hungry? Mustn't worry about it, Stevie. Things don't stand much lookin' into. Long as you and me love each other, Stevie, that's the important thing. Um... And Mr. Verloc... Does he love me? Course he does, Stevie! He's a good man, Mr. Verloc. Go on. Get up! Get up! Takings very small today. That's the least of my worries. I've been called to a meeting tomorrow. At the Russian embassy. It can't be anything good. - Come to bed. - Mmm. I thought I was never gonna get rid of'em tonight. All those wretches. Mr. Michaelis is a nice man. He can afford to be. He's found that old duchess or whatever she is to support him. And Ossipon? He'll want for nothing. As long as there are silly girls in the world... with savings bankbooks. That boy isn't fit to hear what's said here. - He doesn't know any better. Thinks it's all true. - Mmm. It's bad enough him having to get used to Mother being gone. What did she want to go and do that for? Perhaps it's just as well. He's such a good boy. I couldn't do without him. Would you like to... Or shall I put the light out? Yeah. Put the light out. Ah, yes. You stole us the plans of the breech-block off their field gun, did you not? I did. How much did you get for that? - Five years' hard labor. - That'll teach you to get caught. Sit down. Now, you purport to be a desperate... socialist or anarchist, am I right? - Anarchist. - Very corpulent for an anarchist, aren't you? - What's that? - "Overweight anarchist"... seems to me to be something of a contradiction in terms. How long have you been drawing pay from this embassy? Eleven years. I've read all the reports you sent us last year... and I must say... I'm at a loss to understand why you wrote them at all. Only three months ago, I sent you warning of a plan to assassinate the grand duke... on his visit to Paris! The French police assure us your information was exaggerated and inaccurate. And don't shout. The Secret Service is, by its nature, difficult to describe. But I can certainly tell you something it is not. It is not a philanthropic institution. You are supposed to be agent provocateur. I cannot think what you have provoked. Except for my irritation. I brought you in to tell you that from now on, I expect you to start earning your money. The good times are over. No work, no pay. You summoned me here with a most peremptory letter. This is only the third time I have been here in 11 years... and the first time I've arrived... through the front door in broad daylight! You seem to have no regard for my safety whatsoever. Your safety is your affair. If I were seen coming here, it would destroy my usefulness. If you cease to be useful... Let me assure you of this... You shall be chucked. I take it you know about the international conference in Milan. I read the newspapers. Then you will have observed... that the debate on the suppression of international terrorism... has been entirely inconclusive. The British government in particular is reluctant... to abandon its absurd and sentimental policy... of offering asylum to so-called political refugees. Your damned friends have only to fill in an application. It means I can keep them all under my eye. More to the point, I want them under lock and key. I want them handed back to us so that we can deal with them properly. The absence of a system... of a rational repression in this country is a scandal. I have decided that this is... the correct psychological moment... to instigate such a repression. This is why I've sent for you. What I want is a series of outrages. Not necessarily sanguinary. I'm not a butcher. But startling. An attack, for example... upon the fetish of the hour. Now, what do you suppose that that might be? Well, I don't know. Then pay attention. I will try not to talk above your head. The class we're trying to attack is very difficult to shock. Conventional assassination... they take in their stride. A bomb in the National Gallery would create some effect... but principally among artists and art critics. People of no account. No, the sacrosanct fetish of the hour is science. Science? Unfortunately, it is not possible to throw a bomb into pure mathematics. And of course, the details of the enterprise... I leave entirely to you. But I do have a suggestion. I thought you might. Yes. What do you say... about having a go at astronomy? Astronomy? Everyone has heard of Greenwich... even the bootblacks in Charing Cross Station. Nobody actually understands what it is, this new Greenwich Mean Time... but it has a mystical significance. The first meridian. An attack upon time itself. Entirely gratuitous and wonderfully inexplicable. If that doesn't stir the authorities in this country... out of their cretinous torpor, I don't know what will. - It'll cost money. - Oh, no. That cock won't fight. You'll get your usual screw... and if something doesn't happen very soon, you won't even get that. Do I make myself clear? Is that all? The Milan conference reconvenes in a month. Unless you provide us before that time with a dynamite outrage... your connection with us is at an end. And now you may go. The first meridian, Mr. Verloc. Go for the first meridian. - Bad day? - Atrocious. He'd do anything for you, that boy. Adolf. What are you thinking about? Emigrating. - What? - To France or California. I couldn't do that. You'd have to go by yourself. And you couldn't do without me. Could you? No. I couldn't. Stevie? Are you all right? He's moping up there on the landing again. It's all along with Mother leaving. Mmm. I'm going out. Why don't you take him with you? I can't. Fresh air would do him good. Go get your coat. I had a letter from Michaelis today. Did you? His duchess has given him the use of a country cottage... to finish his book, if you please. And he's offered to, uh, put up Stevie for a few days. That's nice of him. But you couldn't do without him, could you? Of course I could. If it were somewhere he wanted to go, why not? I'll take him down, then. Good-bye, darling. I love you, Winn. Off you go. Like father and son. Do you give your stuff to anybody who wants it? I never refuse anyone. I make it an absolute rule. As long as I have a little pinch left for myself. - And you think this is a sound principle? - Perfectly. You mean, uh, you'd sell to the police? They'd leave me alone. Couldn't they arrest you if they wanted to? - What for? - "What for"? Dealing in explosives without a license. Oh, it's very well known to the police... that I never part with the final handful of my wares. I carry it right here, next to my heart. What if six policemen jump on you in the street? In my left pocket, I carry an India-rubber bulb. I always walk with my hand closed around it. If I squeeze it, it activates the detonator. Works on the same principle as the shutter of a camera lens. - Instantaneous? - No. Unfortunately not. I estimate 10 seconds will elapse between applying pressure and the explosion. Ten seconds? That's a lifetime. I'm working on it. I'm trying to invent a detonator that would adjust itself to all conditions... without loss of reliability. A perfectly precise mechanism. A really intelligent detonator. This one's not so bad, though. See that couple going up the stairs? This would finish them. And everyone else in the room. Character. You see? That's all that counts... force of personality. Suppose you meet a policeman of character? Be a character based on conventional morality, dependent on life. In other words, inhibited. Infinitely vulnerable. I rely on something which knows no restraint... which cannot be attacked... death. I've never understood what it is you want. Just one thing... a perfect detonator. - More. - Right away, sir. It's a precise aim. Unlike you, with your delegations... your committees, your revolutions. Which are simply a mirror image of the society you pretend to despise. Here we are, sir. Did you know there was, um, a man blown up in Greenwich Park this morning? - No. - Huge explosion. Fragments of body everywhere. Here you are. The usual newspaper "gup." Criminal stupidity. I don't know what you mean by "criminal." What everybody else means. I mean, something like this is very dangerous for people in our position. And you tell me you are giving your stuff away to any fool who comes to you. Both hands. Freely. 'Cause what's needed is a clean sweep. I don't give a damn about consequences. Can you describe the person you gave the explosives to? Describe him? Yes. I can describe him in one word... Verloc. Verloc? He said he wanted it for some kind of demonstration against a building. And he wanted to be able to carry it in public without arousing suspicion. So I cut the bottom out of an old one-gallon copal varnish can. Afterwards, I re-soldered it. I put the detonator in the screw cap. What do you suppose happened? I don't know. Once you tighten the cap and make the connection... gives you 20 minutes. It also becomes extremely volatile. So, either he let the time run too close or he let it fall. I can't imagine what came over Verloc. He was a nobody. A quite ordinary personality. Useful, but no more. Married, even. Ran a shop, which I imagine... his wife started for him. He didn't tell you why? I didn't ask. I don't know what I should do. What you usually do, I imagine. Fasten yourself to the woman for all she's worth. Well, well, well. - Chief Inspector Heat. - It's all right. I'm not looking for you. Not this time. When I am, I shall know where to find you. And I'm sure your obituary will be more flattering than you deserve. Also, however conscientiously your friends may try and sort us out... I'm afraid some of you may end up being buried with some of me. This sort of stuff is all very well for frightening children. No time like the present. You'll never have a more favorable opportunity for making a humane arrest. It's just you and me. Not even a cat around. Surely that's a worthwhile self-sacrifice for a public servant. You'd do it if you knew how cruelly tempted I am every time I walk in a crowd. If I was to grab you now... I'd be no better than you. You'll never get me so cheap. I don't know what your game is. I don't expect you know yourself. You're really famous for not understanding our game. Well, whatever it is, give it up. You'll find we're too many for you. Good job you people always make such a mess of things. If a burglar was that incompetent, he'd starve. Better at my work than you are. That's quite enough of that. Lunatic. Good day. Evening. Please make yourself comfortable, Chief Inspector. Thank you, sir. Sit down. A couple of weeks ago, you assured me there was no prospect whatsoever... of any outbreak of anarchist activity. I passed this on to the home secretary. He was extremely pleased. He smiled at me. I wonder if you can imagine how annoying I find the memory of that smile. None of our lot had anything to do with this, sir. Tell me what you discovered in Greenwich. Our man arrived at Maze Hill station at 11:08 on the Gravesend train. Short, stocky fellow. He was carrying a tin can. - As a matter of fact, there was two of them. They'd come from a place called Aldington, near Hythe. An old woman saw them making their way towards the observatory. The explosion happened about 10 minutes later. A constable heard it. He was on the scene within a minute or two. What evidence do you have that it was the same people? Strips of yellow tin in the vicinity. Only one of them was killed. - How do you know? - Bits and pieces only added up to one body. Couldn't identify him, but he had the right number of everything. Good deal ofhim they had to scrape up with a spade. Nice treat for the coroner's jury. Filthy weather. The home secretary said he'd been told we were very efficient. And what we seemed most efficient at was making him look a fool. There is one what you might call chink of light, sir. - This place in Kent. Aldington, near Hythe. - Yes? Odd sort of place of origin for two ruthless terrorists, wouldn't you say? Not if you happen to know that not more than a mile away, there is a cottage... occupied at present by the ex-convict, Michaelis. I thought you just told me our anarchists had nothing to do with this affair. Doesn't mean we can't issue a charge if we feel like it, sir. You'll need some pretty conclusive evidence. I don't think that'd be too difficult, sir. I can look after that. Trust me for that. Man like that has no business being out of prison, if you ask me. None of them do. I tell you, sir. Makes me long for the days when I was catching good, honest thieves. At least you know where you are with thieves. Bit of mutual respect. At least they're normal. I believe you're hiding something from me, Chief Inspector. What is it? Something with regards to Michaelis, sir? No. What's puzzling me, in fact... is your eagerness to shunt the whole train off into a siding marked "Michaelis." So you'd better tell me what else you've discovered. As a matter of fact, there was another matter... I'd intended to draw to your attention in due course. - I found an address. - An address? - That's right, sir. On the corpse. - What address? - 32 Brett Street. It's a shop. - What kind of shop? The kind of shop you might expect to find in Soho, sir. Who runs this shop? A man who, from time to time... I have occasion to make use of. Does he have a name, this paragon? Verloc. A personal friend of mine in the French police tipped me the wink... that he was a secret agent in the pay of the Russian embassy. So I called on him one evening, told him who I was. He didn't bat an eyelid. Said he was a married man and didn't want any trouble. So we came to an arrangement. Describe it. I had a word with the customs people... made sure they wouldn't interfere with any of his shipments... and in return, I'm able to consult him whenever I think there's something in the wind. - And how long has this been going on? - Seven years. No wonder your reputation for omniscience is so established. So, in other words... you would rather throw an innocent man to the lions... than dispense with the services of so useful an informant. I would hardly describe Michaelis as an innocent man, sir. Even though I know he enjoys a number of influential friends, sir. If you mean the duchess of... Isn't she a particular friend of your wife, sir? As to that, the first secretary at the Russian embassy is a member of my club. And I may say, it's most improper of you to try finessing with me in this way. This Verloc is a spy in the pay of a foreign embassy. I don't feel disposed to overlook that fact... just because he may privately be of service to you. It's my opinion he knows nothing at all of this business. Then how do you account for the address? I don't account for it. You see, I begin to see this as a heaven-sent opportunity... to deal with a whole gang of spies... agents provocateur, and all kinds of political riffraff. You may go. Report to me here at 9:00 tomorrow morning. As you please, sir. Harold! Just the man I was hoping to run across. - How are you? - Will you take a drink with me? Unfortunately, I have an errand to run. Busy day, huh? With this outrage in Greenwich Park? - Just so. - I have said this before... I cannot understand... why your government is so indulgent towards these terrorists. Perhaps it is because you're not so cruelly affected as we are in my country. We're on the track of a man called Verloc. - What? - I understand you know him. What makes you think that? He has no secrets from us. A lying dog of some kind. This may well be the breakthrough we've been waiting for. - What do you mean? - In our campaign to clear out of this country... the despicable scum that use embassies as a cover for their criminal activities. I have an appointment. I believe I've heard you complain of the inefficiency of our police. But within eight hours of this explosion, we seem to have established... not only the perpetrator but even the instigator behind him. Not bad, wouldn't you say? Aren't you impressed? Where's your umbrella? I must have left it somewhere. - Have you been down to see Stevie? - No, no. You've let yourself get soaked through. I'll... I'll... I'll be all right. You'll be laid up with a cold, next thing. No, I'll be all right. I'll get the tea on. Where you been all day, anyway? Nowhere. I... d-did go to the bank. What for? To draw out the money. All of it? Yeah. All of it. Why? I thought I might need it. I don't understand. You can trust me. You know that, don't you? Oh, yes. I trust you. If I hadn't trusted you... I wouldn't have married you. You're all right with me. Not tired of me yet? - Shop, Adolf. - What? What? You'd better go. Are you feeling all right? I find I have to go out this evening. You over from the continent? You do understand English. Oh, yes. I understand English. Did you know Mr. Verloc in France, perhaps? I've heard of him. Adolf. - You're not going out with all that money on you? - Money? Oh. Yes. No. - You know that man? - I've... I've heard of him. He's not one of those embassy people you were talking about? Embassy people? I could cut their heart out as soon as look at them. Get rid of him as quick as you can and come back home to me. You want looking after. I can only help you if you tell me everything. - You understand that, don't you? - I'll tell you everything. Husband in by any chance, Mrs. Verloc? - No. He's gone out. - I wanted a word with him. I'd wait if I thought he wasn't going to be too long. Any idea where he's gone? He didn't say. I think you know who I am. I'm a policeman. You know that. I try not to bother my head about these things. My name is Heat... Chief Inspector Heat... of the Special Crimes Department. Oh, yes? So, your husband didn't say when he'll be back? He's out with someone. - Friend? - No. Just someone who called. Would you mind telling me what this "someone" looked like? Tall, thin fellow. Sort of foreign-looking. Damn it. I thought as much. In that case, I think I won't wait for your husband. You're very calm... but I expect you could give me a pretty good idea about what's going on if you felt like it. What is going on? There's something else. A small matter. Perhaps you might be able to help us. Yes? We've come into possession of... of what we believe might be a stolen overcoat. We're not missing an overcoat. In the overcoat, there is a label... with this address written in purple marking ink. - Well, that must be my brother's. - Could I have a word with him? - He's not here. - Where is he? Staying with a friend in the country. - Has he got a name, this friend? - Michaelis. Oh! Excellent. Yes. Now we're talking. So, Michaelis had nothing whatever to do with this affair? No. It was just that Stevie, my brother-in-law... he was stayin' at his house in the country. I collected him about 8:00 this morning. Told Michaelis I'd bring him back tonight. We took the train to Maze Hill. Arrived, I don't know, about 11:00. In the park... I primed the bomb... and sent him off with it. I was fond ofhim, you know? I was really fond of that boy. I'm sorry. Appalling place you've brought me to. Serves very well for the refugees they send me over from the continent. I suppose it's a question of what you're used to. All right. Let's get down to business, shall we? You see, it strikes me, Mrs. Verloc... that you probably know more about this bomb business than you're aware of. What bomb business? I don't know what you're talkin' about. Bomb went off this morning in Greenwich Park... by accident, most like, since one of the perpetrators was blown to bits. And I have reason to suppose that your husband... might be able to help me with my inquiries, that's all. Adolf would never get mixed up in anything like this. I know that. It's just information I'm after. And you're quite sure he hasn't spoken to you about it? I take it you can identify this? Yes. Your brother... Is he in the habit of going about labeled? He sometimes gets a bit confused. So I made that label and sewed it in for him. He's all right. There's nothing wrong with him. It's just sometimes he likes to go see his mother on his own, and l... I like to be on the safe side. Is he a short, stocky fellow? No. He's tall and fair. I don't understand. That label, whatever did you tear it out for? What do you want? A word or two. You'd better come upstairs, then. Took a little while for the penny to drop. It was only while I was talking with your wife just now... that I realized you must be the other man. You gonna take me in? I know who you've just been talking to. It's his case now. But I'm the one who traced you. Make no mistake about that. How? Take a look at that. What's she wanna try a dodge like that for? Made you an offer, did he? He says if I cooperate fully, I'll get two years, maximum. Promises are easy. If I was you, I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him. I've gotta trust somebody. What you gonna tell them? Everything. You know me. I'm always straight. That's why I've been so useful to you. Lot of useful things this is gonna put a stop to. See, he was simple. That was the trouble. We went over it all I don't know how many times. It couldn't have been easier. I was just standin'there, waiting. Then you heard the bang. Came too soon, you see. That's when I knew he'd gone. Oh. I don't know what could have happened. We've been able to piece it together, more or less. Looks like he stumbled over a root. You're right about him being gone. His head and feet were still there. The rest ofhim, they had to scrape up with a shovel. Couldn't you take me in tonight? I'd come quietly. I daresay. But by tomorrow morning, this isn't gonna be my case anymore. Thanks to your new friend. Jail's the only safe place for me. They'll all be looking for me now. If I'm not careful, I'm liable to end up with a knife in me back. You want my advice? Private advice from Private Citizen Heat? Clear out. Vanish. We won't chase after you. I can see to that. Neither will your people. They all think you're dead already. How do you know? I'd say they'd make a logical assumption that it was your guts... spread all over Greenwich Park, wouldn't you? He's a good man, Mr. Verloc. I never meant any harm to come to the boy. You know that. l... I couldn't think how I was gonna break it to ya. I sat for hours in the Cheshire Cheese worrying me head off. It can't be helped, Winnie. What's done can't be undone. Look, you want to look at a fellow? I never want to look at you again as long as I live. Come on, Winnie. Be reasonable. This won't bring him back! Well, supposin' it had been me you'd lost. Where would you be then? You know I don't like to worry you. Well, so l... I didn't tell you what a spot this embassy bastard had put me in! Eleven years I've worked for him. I've risked my life I don't know how many times. There's scores of those revolutionists I've sent off to be caught red-handed. The highest in the world has got me to thank for still walkin' on their two legs! Then this new swine turns up. Ignorant. Overbearing. Thinks he knows it all. I should've taken him by the throat... and rammed his head up that embassy chimney! I'm sorry, hon. I haven't eaten all day. I could've done too. They wouldn't have dared call the police. You know what I mean? I love you, Winn. You're gonna have to pull yourself together sooner or later, my girl. Perhaps you ought to go to bed. What you need is a good cry. I thought you were like father and son. What? But you were just takin' him away from me to murder him. - Oh, now, hang on. - And there was I, sure you'd come home with a cold. No, no, listen. I was upset! I was upset about you! And the boy, of course. Listen, Winnie. We're gonna have to make plans. Do you understand what I'm saying? I'm gonna have to get away. And you're gonna need to be extra careful. They're gonna be watching you all the time. You're gonna be on your own... for a while. Till the right moment. Then you can slip away and join me. - Abroad? - Yeah, course abroad. I don't want to make it easy for 'em to catch up with me and do me in. I think too much of you for that. What about Ste... Where you going? Upstairs? That's right. A bit of rest and quiet. Won't be long before I join you. Look at the time, Winnie. Your mother'll be dead before you get there. Show a bit of sense. Look, I don't want to make a point of this... but you're the one who brought the police here by sewing in that label without tellin' me. Now, take off your hat. I can't do without you this evening. Come on. Sit down. Oh, take the damn thing off! That's more like it. The boy's gone. You think I wanted him to blow himself up? It was an accident. Just as much as if he was run over by a bus. You're the one who kept pushing him my way, telling me to take him out for walks. If you look at it that way... you'rejust as responsible for his death as I am! I wish to goodness I'd never laid eyes on Greenwich Park. Winnie... - Winnie... - Yes. I know what'd do you good. Come over here. Come on. Don't. Aah! I never wanted you. All I ever wanted was somewhere safe for Stevie. What? Mrs. Verloc. - Mr. Ossipon. - I was on my way to see you. - You were? - Yes. - Where are we going? - Will you help me? Can't you take me away? Out of the country tonight? I don't think there is a train till the morning. Well, isn't there somewhere you can hide me? - No. I can't take you back to my lodgings. - Somewhere else, then? But I-I have no money on me, you know? - We anarchists are not very rich. - I have money. - How much? - All the money. - What do you mean? - All the money he had in the bank. Then we are saved. What's the matter with you? Don't understand why you look so morose. I'd heard you'd come into a little legacy. - Do you want it? - What? The legacy. You can have it, all of it. So send off tomorrow for certain chemicals, things that I need. If this is all right, I'll pass the bill to you. Whatever you like. Wait. There is a midnight ferry from Southampton to Saint-Malo. - 10:30 from Waterloo, I think. - Can we go back to the shop? - The shop? What... - I packed a case. Well, all right. It's upstairs on the floor. Aah! - A policeman... He spotted me. - What? If he comes in, kill me. They'd hang me, Tom. I can't bear the thought. - Did you do that? - He killed my boy. Oh, my God. It was the degenerate in the park. - My Stevie. - Oh, my God. - The money's upstairs? - No, it's on me. Let's get out of here, or we'll miss the train. - You'd better let me have the money. - Yes, Tom. Wait here. Yes? Yes? We should keep apart until the train leaves. Another one. I tipped the guard, so we'll have the compartment to ourselves. You think of everything. Extraordinary boy, that brother of yours. You were the only one that took any notice of him, Tom. I loved you for it. Safe journey. If I didn't know you better, Ossipon, I'd conclude that you're in the throes of remorse. Pull yourself together. Remorse is for the weak. And weakness is the source of all evil on this earth. There's a time coming, and it's gonna be sooner rather than later... when this'll be understood by governments as well as individuals... that there can be no progress and no solutions... until you make a rational decision to exterminate the weak. I myself have no future. But I am a force. To the destruction of what is.
