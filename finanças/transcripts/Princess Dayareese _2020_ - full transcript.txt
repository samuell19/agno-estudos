I have some extra cash. Thanks! Hey bro. Cousin! What's this I hear... that you guys are still running scams? And that you bought a spot for a Korean restaurant? Why are you all looking at me like that? Who's that? Your brother! Eliver! Then who's this? Hey! -Hmmm? -Hey! Wake up! Then who is this? You said you'd buy my duck eggs, then you took me here. You said you were just getting money. Weirdo. Aunt Sharon, that's why we're hustling for money. We need to get you checked for your memory loss.

[elevator bell dings] -Oh my... -[phone ringing] Hello! Hello! I told you! 4 p.m., right? Yeah, 4 p.m. Did you prepare everything? Of course! I'm born ready! Don't you trust me? I thought you did...

So reserve all your energy now. Because we'll be up all night! Hello? Hello? Hello? Choppy! Choppy! Hello? I'm on the way. Yeah, yeah. -Choppy. -Hello? Chubby?! -Not, not you. -Weda, are you here? Who's chubby? I said choppy! What's your problem? Maintenance! Clean the elevator! It's so dirty! Ha! Maintenance! Shouldn't six people be able to fit in this elevator? Someone here is making that impossible! You're lucky I'm busy with a job tonight. Otherwise, I would make my aunt shred you to pork rinds! The batteries... [soft music plays] Oh shoot! Oh. Sorry. I just freaked out because of your face. No. It's okay. You okay? I'm okay. Sure? Yeah! I'll take care of that! It's okay I'll get that. -[Weda] Cal! Cal! -It's okay, I'll get that. [Weda] Bro! Sure?

Chill a little, no? I'm working on it. You have to relax. You're always tensed! What did I tell you? We are gonna make the best documentary the world has ever seen. So bro, just relax, huh? Princess is missing! She's missing! No no no! Let's go! -Let's go! Let's go! -Go go go! Where were you? You took forever to get here! The clients have been waiting! Sorry, cousin. I had that gig at the hotel. Then I got into a fight with the elevator operator and I had to deal with so many things. You should've called me so I could-- [cop] Reese Termulo? Yes, sir? Come with us. We've received many complaints against you. What? Huh? And you! Come with us, too! Let's go! Cousin! Let's go! [siren wailing] I already warned you. I've told you so many times to stop your schemes! You're lucky the tourists agreed with the refunds. Good thing they didn't file lawsuits! What if they filed cases against you? What then? We're sorry, Auntie. Really sorry. Hold on. Where did you get cash to pay off the tourists? Right. What payment? Reese, I showed Mom where we stashed our savings. I didn't want you locked up in jail. Plus, -I got you, right? -[phone ringing] Mom, I'll tell you what happened. Sir... I wonder if we could get an extension on our payment-- [Mr. Casillas] Say goodbye to the restaurant forever! Relax sir, you're screaming is so intense. It's like you're right here. I am right here! I gave the spot to someone else! Losers! Cousin, it's okay if I stop going to school for a while. So we can all save up again. And we can send Mom to the doctors. Plus, we can put up the business. Don't worry. I got you all. Mister Thanos. Reese! You're here again! You know you're not allowed here! Please let me in. I really need to talk to him. You can't talk to him. I'm the one he gets mad at. Give me a break! Don't come back here again. Your grandpa will scold me again! And as always, if you see the gate open, you'll just enter. Yeah, you're always like that. Then, I won't be able to stop you. Even if I can't see you, I know you'll enter. Damn it. Just like what I said. -Good morning, Grandpa! -Reese! What are you doing here? Actually Grandpa, I had a meeting with my business partners. Which is why, I'm wearing this. We'll start another business. I just need a little money for additional capital-- I don't believe you. You think you can trick me? You may leave now. I don't allow swindlers in my home. Is that the best you can do? Can't you be more than this? Both you and your mom are swindlers. You think that lowly of me and where I came from? You really can't accept who my mother was. [grumbles] [car door opens] -[car door closes] -[engine starts] [sobs] [Reese] Where am I? Why did they kidnap me, we don't have any money. What did they cover my head with? This smells stuffy. [Reese] Hey! Are you the kidnappers with white van? We don't have any money so please, let me go. Let me go. Oh crap! You look ugly. Who are you? Why did you kidnap me? This is Princess Ulap from Oroh Kingdom. Borta, her royal guard! Why do we look so alike? You just have a mole on your face and many tattoos. I don't know why we have the same face. I was also surprised when I saw you at Liwasan. I instantly thought of a plan. Because of you I can stay here. Even if the convention is over. So I can search for my Cardo. Cardo? Cardo! Cardo is in the province! He's that actor from the show "Provincial"! Let me go home. Cardo is actually a nurse. He visited Oroh. We fell in love. But my father prohibited our love. So I'm here. I'm here to see him. Silly romantic. You're just hopeless! Please. This is my only chance. This is for love. Have you ever been in love? Love cannot feed me! I'm out! But my money can feed you. All of this money? That's only the down payment. Yes, ma'am! I'm free anytime! What do I need to do? You need to be me. You need to be the princess. [tribal music plays] Long live princess dear! [Denden] You can't drink yet. So, you're going to be Princess Diana Reese. Yeah, big time! I told you guys, I got you all! Okay okay, wait, so when are you leaving? Tomorrow. How long will you be there? Forty days. [dramatic music plays] Forty days? After that, you're off to heaven? -Ouch! -You go first. Hmmm, forty days... Well, why forty days then? You see, there's going to be a documentary shoot at the island. And on the 40th day, I'll leave with them so it won't be too obvious. Someone will fetch me at the port. All the plans are set! I'll be safe! Reese... Yes? To be honest, we're going to miss you. It's true, Reese. Definitely. [dramatic music plays] You wanted this, right? [Reese] You wanted this, right?! So why are you crying? You wanted this. Right? I want these too. Alright. I might be able to sell these there. But I'm really going to miss my family. Ulap said there's no phone signal there! [crying] [Reese] Nice! There's no one around. I can also take this-- [door opens] [yelps] Princess Ulap, are you ready? Yes. I'm ready. Are you? [tribal music plays] [Reese] We've walked a million miles already! I'm so dizzy! Are we there yet? [tribal music continues] [bright music plays] [Reese] Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet? I think we are here. Why aren't they happy that the princess is home? Where are the gowns? What's with their outfits? Where's the grand palace? Is this Oroh Kingdom? Confirmed! This is Oroh Kingdom! [Reese] Who are these two? What did Ulap teach? [bangs] You need to learn the Oroh Language. [Ulap] The Orohnians can understand English but only the royal family can speak it. [in Orohnian] How... are... you... father? [laughs] -[Borta grunts] -[groans] That hurt. Focus. Focus. You learn fast. I think you're ready. My final advice. Less talk, less mistake. Ouch. Focus. [Reese] Good thing I trained with Ulap. Bibi and Nini. My royal assistants. Princess Ulap... [tribal music continues] [goat bleats] [drum beat] She has returned... Pak! The chief messenger and member of royal court. Princess Ulap! Princess Ulap! [Orohnians chanting] Princess Ulap! -[chanting continues] -[drum beat] [Reese] So this is the Oroh palace-- Oh, my god. What is he doing here? Focus. Just focus. Look away. Don't stare at him. Just like that. You can do it. I'll just look over here. -[chanting continues] -[drum beat] [Nini] Faster. Time to wash Her Majesty's feet. [drum beat] [percussion music plays] -Oh! -[music stops] [humming] Oh! [singing] Tandesa, our chief elder. And my grandmother. The king has a dire disease. [sobs] There! You see that? The princess never spoke and she never showed her emotions. That's not her. Bro, her father's sick. Of course she will cry. Come on. Don't you have a family? [Pak] During the last three days, King Amala has fallen terribly weak and can no longer perform his duties. Because of this... Princess Ulap, you will be crowned as queen. Right now! [Orohnians exclaim] [Reese] I am going to be the queen? [drum beat] First time in Oroh history that something like that will happen. [Reese] This is my moment. Lucky charm is working-- -That hurt. -[drum beat continues] This is taking too long. Come on, hurry! Fine, I will-- [woman in Orohnian] Stop the coronation. In English, stop the coronation! [instrumental music playing] This is Diwa... Oh, never mind. She's just my cousin. [laughs] I am here to fight for the throne! She will challenge the crown! The law states that if the throne is threatened and the next in line is not present for one sunrise and sunset... the throne will be opened to the next rightful heir. Beloved Tandesa, is that true? It's true! [Reese] Damn it. It's time for a new Oroh. Forget the past, so we can move to the future! We need a new Oroh! Right, cousin? Get ready for the trials! It will take place in the next few days. [Reese] Lucky Charm, please work again. Let's fake it, 'til we make it. Wow! There are some over there. Princess Diwa... Excuse me, Princess Diwa? Is it okay if we interview you? It's okay. I'm okay. Oh shoot! Ouch! Princess uh... It's okay. I'm okay. Princess... [Weda sighs] [Weda] The place with signal is too far, bro. But good news, Yeyflix gave us an important playdate. Nice shot, bro. What if I told you that I'm right about the princess? What if I told you that she is-- Fake? Yes, how did you know? She's an alien, right? I'm serious, dude. And I am too. Where is your proof? You want proof? I'll give you proof. Your kingdom is no palace! Where's the chandelier? Where are the jewelries? Where are the ball gowns? Well? Answer me! Apologies, Miss Reese. I was just afraid you wouldn't accept my offer. Shut up! You don't have the right. Plus, you also have a bratty cousin trying to fight me for the crown? What the heck? And why didn't you say that one of the documentarists is Filipino? That handsome snob you just know you could fall in love with? Hey! What are you saying? That is not what we agreed on. One more hiccup and I'm out of here! -Princess Ulap... -Princess Ulap... King Amala is looking for you. Yeah? I shall ready myself. Thank you. Thank you? The princess never says thank you. Shut up. She's thanking me, not you. [King Amala coughs] -[reciting Oroh's healing chant] -[coughing continues] Your Highness, Princess Ulap is here. [coughs] [Reese] Bet this is why the king keeps coughing! Your Highness, until next time. [reciting Oroh's healing chant] [King Amala exhales sharply] [coughs] [King Amala] How was... the Cultural Convention? [coughs] Life outside is different, right? Because of global warming, it's hard for us to sustain our island. Diwa believes that changing our ways, building a huge resort, can save us. [coughs] What can you say? [Ulap] Less talk, less mistake. [yells] Answer me! [coughs] You speak English well. Right? That's why you had the guts to search for Cardo? I allowed you to go there because the council and Tandesa decided it was wise. Clearly, you are selfish. You only want the easiest way. Apologies, Father King. Prove yourself to me. Defeat Diwa. [coughing continues] My Father King, get well soon. So you can scold me some more. [Reese] That's it. Goodbye, Oroh. Princess! Oh crap! I put something here. Just looking. Mmm. Isn't it late, princess? Should you be alone? Where are your royal assistants? [Reese] What's with the 20 questions? Resting. Do not disturb. [crickets chirping] [Reese] And he's recording my beauty. He thinks I wouldn't notice. [humming] This rock! Found it! Is that rock too simple for you, Princess? Not like the rare diamonds you're gonna get if you become queen? You do know how much rare diamonds are worth in the Philippines right, Princess? [Reese] Oh, my god! Millions?! I will do anything for those diamonds. And after all of these... Aunt Sharon, your pork rinds are the best! Here's your own restaurant! That's all thanks to Oroh! My dear niece, Reese, thank you so much. All your cousins are elated! They've all graduated! Thank you! [laughs] Thank you, Lucky Charm! Your powers are shining again! Caught you now! [whirring] Is this what you're looking for? That's mine! Mine! Mine mine mine mine mine! Get it, if you can. This is a fake Princess Ulap. Where's the princess? I don't understand, Mr. Caleb. You asked me to come here. You said you want to kiss me. I'll call the royal guards. Guards! -Stop stop stop! Okay! -Help! -Help! -It's off. It's off. Mine again! You want me to make you mine too? Who are you? Where's the princess? What do you call this? [crickets chirping] Neck. In your dreams. -Why would I tell you? -Hey! -Hey! -For what? So you'll rat me out? Hey! Stop! Even if you walk away right now, I'll find out who you are. [laughs] Did you see my performance a while ago? Who do you think they'll believe? You or me? Plus, if you rat me out, I'll just say you're an accomplice. Are you crazy? No one's gonna believe you. We're both Filipinos. I can just say you're after the rare diamonds. Besides, the princess has my back! What? Yeah! Don't worry. She's safe. Worry about yourself. Because if someone catches me, the princess will defend me. Who's got your back? None! So please. Let's just work together. I'll finish my forty days. You'll finish your docu. Deal? Princess Ulap! Princess Ulap! Princess Ulap... We heard your cries for help, Princess! That wasn't me. I'm great. Just enjoying the air. Go. Stop. Be at peace. Leave. Be at peace. Leave. Be at peace. Leave. Leave! Hurry, the princess is already mad! You can go out now. [Pak] The trial will start and will last for thirty days. Before facing the challenges, each challenger will be marked with a symbol of fire. Oh, god! Did you get that? What man? I'm working. Yutaka. [Pak] This is a mark of strength. [yelps] Yutaka, did you get that? [music from headphones] Really? [Reese] This girl's skin is so hard. She's not even flinching. [yelps] [yelps] [shuddering] [Pak] The coronation will happen in thirty days. Whoever wins gets the highest score and will become the leader of Oroh. But each challenge is a surprise! The first challenge, The first challenge is... The first to bring back the legendary bird in Oroh... the chicken! What the hell, bro. [Reese] Ah, so you're afraid of chickens, huh? [applause] [shell horn sounds] [chickens fluttering] -[Orohnians cheering] -Princess Ulap! -Princess Ulap! -Princess Diwa! [clucking] [clucking] Princess! [clucking] There's a special marker attached to the chicken. You can't cheat. Princess. Got one. Content. Okay okay. Okay. That's not the chicken you need for the competition, so just put it down. -[growls] -[yelps] Stop! Just put the chicken down! Okay. [shushes] Okay. [growls] Put the chicken down! Karma is really fast, isn't it? That's what happens when you cheat. What? "Mandaraya"? What a beautiful word. What does that mean? Nice try. Enough already. You can speak Tagalog already. Here. No battery. So stop pretending. Did you really think you could outsmart me? [Weda] Cal! -Weda! -We've been looking for you! Diwa has already won the challenge. The second challenge is to build a raft. This symbolizes that a leader can survive a tragedy like what our ancestors did. [shell horn sounds] Fight! [cheering] [unsheathes machete] -[percussion music plays] -[drum beat] [unsheathes machete] [chops bamboo] [Reese] That looks dangerous. I'm willing to sacrifice, but I won't risk my life for this. Hey, Princess! No cheating, huh? What? [waves crashing] [chops bamboo] [chopping] [chopping] [screams] -[screams] -[Orohninans exclaim] Just kidding! The princess is so amazing! [applause] Bro, what? I'm working, bro! [applause continues] [chops] Finish! I'm done with the challenge. -[thumps] -[applause] -[screams] -[clattering] The second point goes to Diwa! [clatters] [applause] [Reese] See? I'm still the star of this show. Hmp! [chanting] Diwa! Dear Princess, are you alright? Don't worry about me. [Caleb] Are you looking forward to the next challenge? [Nini] The princess is fine. [groans] You think, I didn't see you goofing around? Is that the best you can do? Can't you be more than this? I'm so disappointed. Is that the best you can do? Can't you be more than this? Bro, sorry I forgot to tell. They said they wanted to preview the initial edit of our work the day after tomorrow. Weda, that's way too soon. What are you talking about? Yeah, but they said you know this already. How am I supposed to know this? Why don't call you them? Find a signal somewhere and verify. Confirm! It's not me bro. They said it so... Bro! [grunts] [groans] What's this? What are you doing here? Give me back my phone and my memory card. Come on. Can I return them after coronation night? Don't you have a conscience? Look around! They're good people here! But you're deceiving them! Just tell me! What is Ulap giving you? Money? You should be ashamed of yourself! You're crossing the line! I'm crossing the line? I'm crossing the line? What? Now you're mad at me? At least I'm telling the truth. What about you? What am I supposed to think when I don't even know who you really are? How can I trust you? She's feeling guilty now, huh? Thank you Lord! Look me in the face. And show me who you are! Oh shoot! [screams] Let go of the princess! Wait wait wait no! Tie the sinner up! Exile! -Exile! Exile! -Exile! Exile! Silence! Mr. Caleb saved my life. [scoffs] With a kiss? Mouth to mouth resuscitation. Wasn't she on top? Quiet you! Father... I stayed behind to finish my raft. All of a sudden, a huge spider fell on my face. I couldn't breathe. My heart stopped beating. He breathed air in me... to save my lungs. Mr. Caleb saved my life. I owe him my life. And I must repay that. Mr. Caleb, is this true? You saved my daughter? I guess this time, my daughter saved you. Release him. Princess! I just wanted to-- To repeat the mouth to mouth resuscitation? -Yes? -No! Just wanted to come by and see if you're really okay. And if maybe we could have a... Private interview? I shall grant Caleb a private interview. Private interview with mouth to mouth resuscitation? -Leave. -Leaving! -Guess I'll go get my camera. -Yes. # Ten little fingers, But oh five are gone # # I searched here I searched there too # # Oh they were just with you # Ouch! You okay? I'm okay. I'm used to it. Hold my hand again! Chill. I'm just trying to make you laugh. You're too serious. I don't understand. Why did you save me? If they had thrown me out, then your problem would be solved. Do I see you as a problem? So I should have just let them throw you out at sea? What about your docu? But you were right. I'm here because of money. I'm a con artist. I have fast hands. [chuckles] Hey Lucky Charm, he smiled! Looks good on him, right? Why do you always talk to that? My dad gave this to my mom. He said it was lucky. But... when my dad died, all the good luck here died too. And all the bad luck came in my life. Here. For your dream. I'm still keeping the card. For now. Honestly, I still don't agree with what you're doing. And I'm still going to expose the truth eventually. But... From the bottom of my heart, thank you. You saved me. I got you! Now you do it. No way. [chuckles] Come on! Just like this. I got you. Your turn. Do it! I got you! ["Isa Pang Ikaw" by Justin Vasquez plays] [chuckles] Killjoy. [both chuckling] You're crazy. Thank you! Told you I'm good at stealing things. Next time, I will steal your heart. [chuckles] Slick moves. ["Isa Pang Ikaw" continues playing] ["Isa Pang Ikaw" continues playing] [rooster crows] -[Reese] It's already morning. -[Nini] Princess Ulap... It's morning. Time to rise. Prepare for the third challenge. [yawning] ["Isa Pang Ikaw" plays] -[music stops] -[gong sound] [drum beat] We remember the time when illness spread in Oroh. The third challenge... We remember the King's sacrifice when he climbed the mountain and sent fire signal to ask help for the sick Orohnians. And that is the King's mountain! [Weda] That's the mountain, bro! But you're not climbing any mountain. Now... Fire up the torches. Each one of you will be accompanied by two Orohnians. You will just circle the kingdom, then return here! The first to return and light the torch, wins. ["Isa Pang Ikaw" plays] [shell horn sounds] Go! -[cheering, applause] -[drum beat] [grunts] ["Isa Pang Ikaw" plays] I got you. Go. [screams] [man] Help! Help! Help me! Help! Just hold on. Alon, Yakal, find some rope! Wait, wait, wait! Are you sure? Maybe this is Diwa's trap to slow you down. That's on Diwa's conscience if she's tricking me. But it'll be on my conscience if I don't help him! Hold on to this. One, two... [screams] Undress! Undress! Undress! Undress! Hold on. Hurry! It's not enough! Take off more clothes! More! Undress! Here, here! Come! Let's pull! One! Two! Three! [grunts] One! Two! Three! [grunts] One! Two! Three! [grunting] Apologies for the inconvenience, dear Princess. I tripped. Diwa made me wear these things! Thank you! I owe you my life. What's important is that you're safe. [Weda] Cal! -Cal bro! -What's up? Need to change battery, bro! Bro change bat! Where's your spare? Where is it? [in Japanese] Master! What, what? Camera still recording. Such a waste of memory card, bro. -Come on. -No! Here. Right, chill, man! [tribal music playing] [people gasping] What are you doing?! [coughing] You left your man in danger. You have lost his trust. [coughing] A true leader never leaves the people in times of suffering. A true leader is the one who gives the people hope. The winner for this round... is Princess Ulap! -[applause] -[drums playing] Lucky Charm is working again! I won! What is your plan? The challenge is up next and it's worth two points. You have to think of your legacy for the Orohnians. Do you have any ideas? First of all, I'm not even from here. So I have no idea. I know nothing! You miss them, don't you? Miss! Your family is watching. What do you want to tell them? What's that? More evidence? You already have that video when I spoke Tagalog. You slick. That one? I'll think about. This one is an exemption. I promise. Really? Yup! For real? Here. Okay. I want to say hi to the Catsao family in Manila. Aunt Sharon! Denden! Eliver! Sheldon! I'm on TV! [giggles] Lucky Charm is bringing luck again! But really, you're the true good luck in my life. So I'll do everything and anything for you! I miss you! I love you so much! Let me see. You know... you're so beautiful... when you're being honest. [soft guitar music plays] It's so windy. Something flew in my eye. Something flew? Nothing flew in your eye? Nope. Come on. [light percussion music playing] Good day everyone! Watch this. [weird chanting] [light percussion music continues] Aw. Aw. I have seen that already. [music intensifies] -Wow! -[birds chirping] [applause] Bye. [people chattering] Wow! [cheering, applause] [Pak] Princess Ulap! They want to talk to you. Thank you for saving my husband, princess. Please accept this special drink -as a thank you gift. -Thank you. Thank you, princess. [horn blowing] Time to release the lights. [soft music playing] [music swells] [Reese] What are the lanterns for? [Reese] What are the lanterns for?They do this at the start of the year They do this at the start of the year as thank you to the island. For giving them a new beginning. [joyful music playing] [Caleb] Let's celebrate! [Reese] Yes! -Oroh wine is amazing! -You're right. And you know, if you win the upcoming challenge, you'll be queen of Oroh. So cheers! To the princess of moles! Cheers! What did you say? Nothing. [chuckles] Really now? Okay. You're getting a mole too. There! This is a symbol. Of what, Your Highness? That today, you are happy. Oh shoot! [chuckles] That's right. When was the last time? Maybe during my 12th birthday. Before I found out that my family is a scam. Scam? Kinda. Do you know the Abdons from Visayas? I just know of a Governor Abdon... From that rich clan with their own museum, plus vast haciendas. I heard allegations of corruption though. And that they kicked out their own farmers just so they could build-- [crickets chirping] Shoot! Are you related to him? He's my grandfather. And my dad followed in his footsteps. Sorry. Hey! -This means you're filthy rich! -[Caleb scoffs] You're the real prince here. I'm not proud to be an Abdon. When I was a kid, I idolized my grandpa. Until I found out the truth... [Reese burps] -Which one? -[Caleb chuckles] Corruption, scandals, killings. I had to wait it out, but as soon as I graduated high school... I flew to the US with a scholarship. I just wanted to get away from... From the money, from the privilege, from the cameras, from the surname. That was right about the time my dad joined politics too. He's also a liar. Surprise! So that's why you're allergic to liars. Yeah. Yeah. That's why I became interested in this field. I can't live with what my family did. So I made a promise, I made a vow to myself that whatever happens, I'll always expose the truth. -But you know what? -Hmm? You're the exemption to that vow. Why? You saved me. -See? -Huh? There are reasons why people do certain things. Have you asked him? Why he became a politician? Have you talked to him? Before you get angry, maybe you can ask your dad his reasons. You gave me a chance. You could give one to your family. Right? What do you call this? Head? Right, head. You keep using your head to judge or justify people's actions. Use this too. Sometimes we have to see people beyond their mistakes. How deep! Cheers to the new Caleb! [both laughing] [mosquito buzzing] You know... Ouch! [both laughing] You know... This wine would be even better with pork rinds. [crunching] Crispy pork rinds? That's what you want? We bought some in Manila. We couldn't finish them, so we brought them here. Want more? Shoot! I miss my cousins! Well, I have news for you. They miss you too. -Reese! How's it going there? -Cousin! -Cheers! -Caleb's cute! Are you an item? [cousins laughing] Lucky Charm is working again! Reese! I like Caleb for you! He's smart! He found us on Facebook just by our surname and location! Hey! My turn! My turn! Cousin... mom was asking about you and your new job. Don't worry, we covered for you. Just take care of yourself there, okay? If things get too tough, just come home. Always remember, you're more important than money. No! Money's important! -What did you say? -She's tough! She can do it! -You little pest! -We love money! [laughing] Come on, I'm just teasing. Sorry. The signal was wonky so the video was just short... Thank you, Caleb! [Reese sobs] I got you, Your Highness. Remember? I love you! ["Isa Pang Ikaw" by Justin Vasquez playing] I said... I love the view! There! I love you too! What did you say? I love the view! How beautiful. Damn beautiful! Beautiful view. Just say it. I love the view... Very very much. I love view. Oh come on! Is the view really that beautiful? Absolutely. That's why I really love this view. I dare you to kiss me. A kiss? Look at the view first. [both chuckling] [screams] I love the view! Watch out, one day I really might kiss you! [Caleb] I love the view! [Reese giggles] One more. [both] I love view! ["Isa Pang Ikaw" by Justin Vasquez continues] -[Weda] Cal! -[both gasp] -Caleb? -Go! Come on, man! There you are bro! [Caleb] Morning guys! What are you doing here? We have an interview, remember? Just checking the location. Scenery you know. Shots for Your Highness. Wanna make sure everything's perfect. All this just for me? Thank you! [Caleb] You guys ready? [Weda] Yeah. Yutaka, check the levels. Moving portrait? What was that? -Probably just the wind, no? -Yeah, yeah. -It's just the wind. -Okay. Let's uhm... [Caleb] So could you move? Just take a few steps back. [Diwa] Okay. Just... there you go... Perfect! -You look gorgeous today. Okay. -Thank you. Game? Oh! [goat bleating] [Yutaka] What's that? [Diwa] What's this? Oh that's just a little prune, princess. You know, raisins! Oh wow! My favorite! No! -Caleb... -Ouch! My legacy is this plan: to build resorts and make this a tourism spot. We also have rare plants we can sell for leisure. Confirmed. This is Cardo's address. We need to leave tomorrow. We'll fetch Ulap. Wait. I'm lost. Why are we picking up Ulap? Diwa said... For the longest time, Ulap wants to escape Oroh. She doesn't want to be the ruler. So if she has the opportunity to get away, she will never return. What if she never returns here? What if they find out about you? They might throw you off the island. Or worse. We don't know what they'll do if their pretense is exposed. Please. Don't risk it-- We can actually partner with other countries to explore our island more. I will bring change to this island! [applause] [drum pounding] Princess Ulap! [applause] Quickly, let's prepare the props. The legacy I want to leave behind is Oroh's story. Once upon a time, a group of people lived happily in an island in the Philippines. Until they had to leave their land because of danger. They sailed not knowing where to go. Until they reached an island with sands that look like gold. That island gave them a new beginning. They poured blood and sweat to make the island liveable. They overcome difficulties because of their leader who inspires the Orohnians. The fire in their hearts made them victorious. Oroh is not just a place. But it is the people. [joyful music playing] Change is important. Opening our doors to the world outside is also vital. But we must not forget... the story of the Oroh people. Change is good but it can also destroy. Especially when we turn our backs to who we truly are as people. Let's not forget the stories of Oroh for here lies our true spirit. We can achieve more progress, if we remain true to ourselves. [music stops] I thought you weren't ready to face the outside world. That's why I didn't want to open Oroh. But today, you reminded me of what our ancestors did. We can never control the waves, but we can always learn how to ride them. This is how Orohnians survived. Through our faith! And through our hearts! Thank you for speaking up. [woman chanting] [cheering, applause] [Reese] Hurry! This is not enough! Ready? One, two, three! [grunts] One, two, three. [background music playing] Princess. [both laughing] Beautiful. They asked me to fit my dress for the coronation. Too bad. They won't be able to see you in it. Let's get your things. Caleb. I'll get the boat ready and everything. We can go now. Wait, I have to tell you something. What? Is it okay if I stay and just finish my deal with Ulap? It's only for a few more days. I'll receive her payment soon. What? I'm already here... Wait. Don't you see how much you've pissed off Diwa? She's dangerous if you stay here. I'm just thinking of King Amala. If I leave, he'll be sad-- -Wait, wait. -No one will attend the coronation. I don't think you understand how bad this is. Diwa's not gonna let you win. He might get sick again. You might get caught. Diwa might take advantage-- You don't know what they'll do to you. Diwa's gonna change Oro! You could die! Do you understand that? You lied. Nothing can change that. Nobody will forgive a liar. Nobody forgives a liar. All your good efforts, all your good intentions will mean nothing! All the truths you tell, will be worthless because of that one lie. Is it worth it? What's one more lie? Oh my god. Can you even hear yourself? You've drowned yourself in so many lies, do you even know who you are anymore? When I think about it, I don't even know your name! I don't know who you are, how old you are. I don't know where you come from. I don't know anything about-- I am Princess Diana Reese Termulo. 21 years old. I live with my mom's distant cousin. Because my grandfather threw us out of the house when my father died. Do you know why? Because he found out that dad met mom at a girly bar. So grandpa thought she was just a gold digger. Stop. You don't have to do this. No. This is it! What if my mom had just lied? What if she just hid her past life, her past job? My grandfather wouldn't have had to kick us out. Then maybe my life would have been easier. Then maybe we shouldn't have to fool others. Then maybe, I wouldn't have to do all these things. [sobbing] Then maybe my mom would still be alive! I'm sorry. Caleb, do you know why I don't want to leave? Because I need the money. Just a little more and our lives will change. I did not go through all of these just to go back home and say, "I'm sorry, we're still poor. I didn't get the money. But it will be okay. Continue to fight." Because it's not really okay. I am so tired of pretending. But I have to do it for them because, who can possibly love the real me? Me. Stop telling me that you love me, when it's not the truth. I love you. I love you. I love you. Stop it. I love you. What's that? Repeat a lie until it becomes a truth? No more, Caleb. Is that for your documentary? There is no documentary. I resigned. Diana Reese, is that your name? Well... Reese... I love you. The real you. Because I saw that amidst all your pretense, your heart never lied. But now I see, it's you. It's you who needs to love yourself. The truth is, my love will never be enough for you. No one's love will ever be enough. You're always going to be sad, and tired, and afraid, and alone. So as long as you're still pretending, you'll never love yourself. Take care of your heart. Yeah? -[Reese sobbing] -[somber music playing] [music swells] [somber music continues] Don't forget the omelette. Please tell the cook. Okay honey, let's eat. Yes, thank you! Caleb? Caleb? Son! Is that true? I'm trying to be a better person, son. I just thought that... If I could be half as good as my son. Then maybe, maybe, finally... I could deserve his forgiveness. I'm so sorry, dad. Mom, I'm so sorry. [Lisa sobs] Can you give me a chance? Of course! You're my son! [suspenseful music playing] [music intensifies] [drums pounding] We've witnessed the princesses go head-to-head. The princess that has won the most points is... Princess Ulap! [cheering, applause] -[water splashing] -[people screaming] -[screams] -[people chattering] All royalties are tattooed with royal symbols in every stage of their lives. Who are you? You lied to Tandesa! You lied to the king! You betrayed Oroh! Your Highness, please let me explain. Stop using our language! Stop disrespecting us. Who are you? Where's my daughter? Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. She's safe. She paid me to do this. But she will come back soon. She will be home soon. Guards, arrest this woman! -Sorry. -Guards! Then I'll be the one who will put you to prison! Princess Ulap, what's happening? What happened? [Diwa] Listen! She is not the princess. She duped us all! [crying] Princess Ulap... Sorry, sorry, sorry. King Amala... I am sure that she is a woman of character. I know it. I feel it! She's a good person. She has many faults. But her heart is that of an Orohnian. She is one with us. Let her speak before we pass our punishment. Alert those from the mainlands. Tell them to take her away from our island. [crying] I don't want to hear anything from her. King Amala! She tricked us! Punish her! King Amala! [funky music playing] Sorry. I'm returning the princess. Father. [woman] What? Another Princess Ulap? Apologies. Mister Caleb explained everything to me. I'm sorry. I didn't know about your illness. I am ready to pay for my sins. I deserve a punishment too, your Highness. No. Please. It's all my fault. To my people, the Orohnians... to each and everyone of you... I'm sorry for what I did. I'm really sorry. You tricked me. That only means that I really don't know my daughter. And I, have failed as a father. But still, you lied to us. And that is a sin. [Reese sobbing] And you? You will not be compensated by the people of Oroh. Nor will be compensated by my daughter. Your guilt will be your punishment. I'm sorry. Sorry. [rooster crowing] [sobbing] Reese... Is this about that white boy? You little pest! Didn't we say none of us will mention Caleb? I only said white boy! Stop fighting! We talked about this outside. No one is gonna mention Caleb. Don't say anything about Caleb. Well you're the one who keeps saying Caleb's name! Reese... Where is he? I'll rough him up! Yes cousin, just say the word. Even is he's a white charmer, I'll totally destroy his face. Bro, rough him up? What if he talks to you in fancy English? He's all smart! Are you sure? My fist will do all the fancy English punching! [Reese] No one's getting hurt. No one's destroying anything. [door creaks] Because I'm the one who destroyed everything. [somber music playing] I know what happened. Sorry, auntie. Sorry. I just wanted to send you to good doctors. I just wanted to repay you for taking me in all these years. Sorry. [Sharon] You know, I often forget things but one truth remains in my heart. [sniffles] One that I will never ever forget: That we are so blessed to have you in this family. So there's nothing you have to repay. You are no burden to us. I'm grateful for you. Hey, you're making all of us cry! What burden are you talking about? You're light as a feather! Let's carry her! [Lisa] Cal, admit it, have you had a girlfriend? Oh wait, time out, time out! Pause that story. Oh no. Favorite! Sorry! - Oh no. - Wow! Your daddy's favorite. Just a few! Your cholesterol! [phone rings] Bro? It's been a while my boy. Got a new gig for you. Are you ready for your new assignment? Bro, I mean sorry for what happened last time but like I said in our last phone call, I don't think we'll be able to-- Beep beep beep beep! Princess Ulap is willing to do an exclusive interview with you, my bro! Wait, what? You heard me right, bro. Princess Ulap is doing this as requested by a girl named, Reese Termulo. She was the reason why we broke up, right bro? [Weda laughing] Got you, bro! Alright talk to you soon! Peace out. Okay, alright, bro. Let's talk soon, okay? Hey Cal, you seem so happy? Yeyflix wants to give me another chance. Woah! Oh! Congratulations, Cal! [Reese] Good morning, grandpa. I keep coming back here because I was hoping that one day you'll welcome me and, that I'll live in this mansion again. Then I'll be happy as I was before. Back when I was still with my father. But you know what, grandpa? I'm okay now. Because I know in my heart, that I am papa's daughter. Grandpa, I'm going to work hard. I will study. I will save up. And even if I never get a mansion like this, it's alright. Because I'm already happy. Thanks, grandpa. You've got guts! You're just like your father. I've waited a long time for you to be true to yourself. Because all I want for you is to live an honest life. And finally, I've met my granddaughter. Without any mask or lies. [dramatic music playing] Our school is open for scholarships. You can study there if you want. [giggling] Aunt, I have to go. Wow! Reese! Caleb is on TV! [Ulap] It's a miracle, but the king is healed. My baby Cardo says that, maybe because he is happier. And so his mind and body are now healthier. And we are slowly restoring our relationship. That's great news! You must be happy about that? Yes I am Mr. Caleb, but, I'm still earning my people's trust. And I hope to be as inspiring as the special girl we met. The girl with a secret identity. We hope she visits Oroh someday. Because we want to see her again. I think you feel the same way. Right, Mr. Caleb? Thank you for this exclusive interview. That boy really is handsome, huh? So Reese, should I message him online? Oh oh oh oh oh! You're being silly! He's already happy with his new life. Auntie, I have to go. I can't be late. Okay take care! Liwasang Bonifacio or Bonifacio Square was once called Plaza Lawton. This place is named after a brave hero who is not afraid to speak his mind: Andres Bonifacio. [shutter clicks] [man] Okay. Thank you. [shutter clicks] So... this statue was built to honor the Father of Philippine Revolution. But I hope everytime you look at Supremo, you will be reminded that we are heroes in our own ways. And that our voices matter. [buzzing] So! I am Reese Termulo, trainee of Likha ng Maharlika Travel and Tours. [applause] Any questions? Good job! We'll continue your training for the next six months. But if your performance is good, then the evaluation can come earlier. Thank you ma'am! Thank you! You deserve it. Thank you! [drum beat] [heart pounding] Reese! Stop! Don't keep your hopes up! Miss! Miss, I have a question! Actually... my question is for Lucky Charm. Hi, Lucky Charm! I'm Caleb Abdon. A man with too much pride. But thanks to this woman I met, because of her, I've realized my faults. My question is, can I get to know her? [chuckles] I want to know everything about the real her. Because honestly, the truth is, I want to be part of her life. What do you call this? Nameplate? Heart! Ah... [chuckles] Silly! You know what's happening? What? It's beating so fast, because you're here. [heart beating] This? What do you call this? - Hey! - What? You call this cheek! One more time! What do you call this? I'm not sure anymore. [both laughing] I'll tell you. These are my... lips. Lips that are saying sorry for everything. Caleb, sorry. I didn't leave with you that time. Sorry, I abandoned you. Sorry that I hurt you. But read these lips when I promise you, that from now on, I will always be true to you. Nice to meet you. I'm Caleb. -[gasps] -[chuckles] You see? I still have fast hands. Remember what I said? What I'll steal from you next? Didn't you get it? I already gave you that. Ages ago. I love you. I love the view again?! No. I love you. I really, really love you. [violin music plays] I love you too. I love you very much. ["Isa Pang Ikaw" by Justin Vasquez playing] Take 2! [claps] One more! ["Panaginip Lang" by Alex Gonzaga playing]
