(birds chirping) Mama I'm home. Mama! Hi, where's mama? - Sit down Francis. - Frannie. Okay, let me have it. - Have what Frannie? - The lecture. I mean you're mad at me right? I mean that's why you're in here with whatchamacallit it and ignoring me. - Frannie-- - How's the bank Jake? Gray on gray, that's exciting. You know, I bet you never once dreamed in technicolor huh? Mama I'm home! - Frannie! Mama's gone. - Gone where? - She died Frannie. - She what? She died? - She died three days ago. - We tried to find you Francis, nobody knew where you were. - We had no idea how to get in touch with you. - But the doctor said she had six months to live. I was there when he said it. - As much as six months. He said she had as much as, not for sure. She wanted to see you. The whole time I was taking care of her she kept talking about ya. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Sorry doesn't cut it this time. - Natalie. She's had a rough couple of months. - Do you know what it's like to bathe your own mother Frannie? Her body was so tiny I could pick her up in my arms. - Where is she? - Every morning she'd look out the window hoping you'd come down the road. Hoping she'd live long enough to hear another one of your stupid jokes. Or your latest R-rated adventure. - Did they close her eyes Nat? - She's buried Francis. We had the funeral. When we couldn't find you we had no choice. - I missed my own mothers funeral. - Where were you? - Me? Oh I was probably up to no good. You know me Jake. (solemn music) Her clothes are in the closet. - [Nat] I know. - Look. - [Nat] What? - Her hair. Beautiful hair. - [Nat] Didn't mean what I said. - Yes you did. It's okay. Did you let daddy know? - [Nat] Why would I? I haven't seen him in forever. - Could I have her hairbrush Nat? - [Nat] Sure. - Thank you. Oh Nat, you know the night mama died, I was probably with some guy. - Don't think about it. - A jerk. A real jerk. You know how you said jerk guys were my specialty? Mama said it was time to outgrow 'em. She wanted me to be settled and normal. - Good luck. - Who carried the casket? - Dave Perkins, Walter Boone, the cousins. - Was it really heavy? - I don't know Frannie. - Nat. I think I really messed up this time. Didn't I? (loud sobbing) I miss her. Nat. - [Nat] Uh huh. - [Frannie] What's it like? To be so responsible. I mean do you ever loosen up? - I like how I am. She's over there. - I can't do this. I can't. - Yeah you can. - Did you take a picture of her afterwards? - Why would I? - Just of her face. Did you? - Stop it Frannie. - When we're born people take all kinds of pictures of us. When you go it's as if everybody's ashamed of you or something. - Are you coming? - You think she's alright? - Did you bring a vase? - I'm gonna plant them. - They're gonna die Frannie. - Well then I brought them to the right place, didn't I? (slow paced music) I remember musical chairs. - Why do you keep going on like that? - I'm not asking you I'm asking mama. - You know what, I'm gonna go back. Are you coming? - I used to love that game. Going around and around. I used to love circles. I love how things go around again. You get that out of a cereal box? - We're storing it in the attic. - For our future home Francis. - Oh. - Speaking of the future Frannie, we've been going over some things we'd like you to think about. - Yeah, when are you two gonna get married? You going for a record for the world's largest engagement? - Frannie, this is serious, it's about money. - Oh mama told me about that. We get $25,000 each. The house belongs to both of us, only she left it in your name. 'Cause she knew you'd take care of things. Oh, I'm gonna buy a horse with my money. - That's not a good idea. - Why not? - Things might change. - How? We have 20 acres. Okay, my horse won't go on your half Natalie. - Frannie, listen. We've been studying your finances and yours-- - I don't really have any finances. - Exactly, that's my point. - What point? - We, Natalie and I, we've got long-term goals. Marriage, family, et cetera. We've been discussing what we think would be best for you and for us. And we think that we should sell the place. - You can't. Mama left it for us to live in. - Natalie will give you half the money Francis. - No. - We figure we'd get a couple hundred thousand. - N period O period. - Frannie-- - She put it in your name 'cause you're the responsible one. It's ours Natalie. Mama wouldn't want this. - Francis, try to see the logic in this. - Oh I'm not letting you sell this place. Not now, not ever. I'm not gonna let you. - Frannie. Frannie stop, can't you ever listen? - Look, if you don't wanna stay here, if it's not fancy enough for you and whatchamajigger, then leave, I don't care. - Right, all you care about is yourself. - At least I'm not selling our heritage. - [Nat] Oh please. - This place was built by hand. You don't even know about the floors. - Since when are you the family historian? - Narrow pine flooring. White Oak sub-flooring. Made from our trees. - What's she getting at? - And the quilts. Quilts made by our great great grandmothers. - You can keep the quilts. - Bit by bit, people like you sold off this land. - You wanna ruin your life, fine. But you're not gonna destroy mine. (solemn music) Hey. - Hey. Where's Romeo? - What do you got against Jake? He was here for me when mama was sick. He helped me with everything. - Well I've never been attracted to sedate men. - I know honesty and responsibility don't appeal to you Frannie, but they appeal to me. I want a secure life, can you understand that? - This place is secure. It's been in our family for over 100 years. You wanna throw it away. - I want a future, I want children. - Who's stopping you? - It takes money, college educations, medical bills. - You're not selling this place. - How much time did you spend here last year? Or the year before that? I think your fellas take up most of your time. - I'm different now. - Right. - I've been celibate for three whole days. (laughing) I have. You know, I think I kept getting into trouble 'cause I knew I could always come back here. - Jake and I will have a nice place. - This is where I wanna be. This is my home. I wanna do what mama always wanted. Be responsible, have roots, get a job. - Where? Doing what? - I don't know. Maybe you could find me something at the factory. - The factory? You've been putting me down for years for working there. Too dull for you, remember? Too tedious for an exciting, imaginative person such as yourself. - I have to get some money so I can buy you out Nat. - You can not be serious. - I am real serious. - How do you expect to get that kind of money? - I don't know, I'm gonna figure something out. I'm gonna do whatever it takes to keep this farm in the family. - Frannie, be reasonable. - I cannot believe that you let Jake talk you into such a hair-brained idea! - He didn't! We both want this. - Well then you both can forget it. (slow paced music) (loud horn whistling) - You're gonna be late. - Okay. Gee, what did they do to the windows? Hey, how come you got windows and the factory didn't? I bet people spent too much time looking out the window dreaming they had a life huh? It's probably more efficient windowless. - So you want to become a part of our family. - Yes sir I do. - Your sister's a wonderful employee. If I recall, she went to college and you didn't, is that right? - [Frannie] Yes sir. She went to Piedmont community college for two years. She had to stop when our mom first got sick. If you want the absolute truth, I didn't like school. I wasn't school material. - You don't have experience in the type of production we do here. - No but I learn fast. When I learned to ride a bike, I got it the first time. Same with water-skis. Well actually, that took me a day, but most people don't ever get up. Definitely not the first day. - Do you know what we do here? - Sort of. - We package. Sew and fold certain products. - Men's underwear. Cotton and silk. - Tell me about your job experience. - Photocopy centers, two restaurants, and an old age home. I only lasted two days. The smell got to me. But I'm more reliable now. Then there was the courier service. I drove around a lot delivering stuff. Packages and stuff. I mean it could have been anything. For all I know I could have been delivering drugs. But I wasn't. Are you okay? - I have a little bit of headache. - Oh you should probably take the day off. - It's been very nice meeting you Francis. I hope you'll be very happy here. - Oh I got the job? - Yes. - Don't you want me to take a test? - Well Natalie will be here shortly. She'll show you around. - I'll be very happy to take a drug test. - That's not necessary Francis. - A lie detector test? - No, if you just take a seat in the outer office-- - You know what, I've always wanted to take a lie detector test. I actually thought that would be fun. I wanna thank you so so much. I won't let you down. I'll do a fantastic job. You won't be sorry. - I've hired a maniac. (faint clanking) - Do you see those women? They're sewing labels into garments. They get credit for the number they do. You can pack or sew labels. - It's easy, who makes the most? - Depends on how fast you go. It's pay by the piece. - I'll pack, I'll be a great packer. - [Nat] You can start now if you want. - Well that sounds thrilling. - Why don't you take the middle position. - Terrific. - You're not gonna start in are you Frannie? - I'm not doing anything. - [Narrator] Here ya go. - They're big. - I did this as a favor to you. - I appreciate that Mr. Osteen. - You found her something downstairs? - I did sir. - She's not really suited for office work. - I know. - Well she's probably not even suited for factory work either. - No sir. - Just keep an eye. - I will sir. - How long do you think she'll be staying on with us? - Not long. Frannie doesn't stick to things much. - Good. Good. You got a couple of aspirin out there? - I'll see what I can do sir. - How's the kid? - Don't ask. He was up all night. Heat rash. - Baking soda, will clear him right up. - Whew, it's like an oven in here. - I always heard she was hot stuff, didn't you Grace? (laughing) - It's probably better I don't hit someone my first day. - Frannie, why you've been hiding? - 'Cause I didn't wanna see people like you. (chuckling) - Frannie back in town. Owe! - Looks like the boys are glad she's back. (perky music) - Stupid idiot machine! (clanking) I can do it. Yes I can do it. I can do it. What's a good count for an average day? - About 1,000. - 1,000? How much do you make for that? - $60. - $60, oh my god. - No snacks, except at break, and no eating on the line! - Sorry. Why didn't y'all tell me? - You didn't ask. - Thanks. I got mixed up on my cardboard. - [Narrator] One up! Yes. - Skirt tight enough? - I had that on earlier. - Baby! - Hey, you sit right here Frannie! - Drop dead. (laughing) (train honking) Oh, I didn't see you. - [Male] I know. - Is it okay to be here? - [Male] Yup. - I don't know the rules. - This is fine. - [Frannie] How long have you been here? - Oh not too long. 10 minutes. Don't mind me, go ahead, take a nap if you want. - Thanks. What do you do here? - I'm the foreman. - The foreman? Oh, is it okay for you to talk to me? I just pack. I'm a packer. - I'm Ruben. - I'm Frannie. - I know. - Oh. Yeah, everybody's heard about me. - Well, the first day's always the toughest. Most of 'em quit after the first week. If you can get past that, it gets easier. Hang in there Frannie. - Thanks. - [Nat] Congratulations. - [Frannie] On what? - Lasting a day. - I ache all over. I made $15. I wish mama was here. She'd say, "I'm so proud of you Frannie, you didn't quit." You think she can see us Nat? Maybe she was looking down at the factory and she saw me working. - I was proud of you Frannie. - I bought us chicken for supper. - Thanks. - You remember daddy loved chicken? You ever wonder where he is? - Not really. - I ate most of it. There's two wings and a thigh left, but I couldn't stop myself. - It's okay. - Who's Ruben? - Ruben Mason? - I don't know. - The one at the mill? - Yeah, who is he? - He's nice, solid. - Too bad. - Dependable like Jake. - How sad. - Did he ask you out? - No, he's spying on me. - If he asks you out say yes. - Another Jake. (laughing) No thanks. Today I'm gonna make more than $15. - Jake and I spoke to the realtor about the house. - I don't wanna hear it. (upbeat music) - Is he ever gonna fix this blasted thing? - Dream on baby. - How long til break? - 15 minutes. - I'm dying. Ethel! Where is she? - Ethel's probably in the bathroom herself. - I gotta go. - They'll dock you. - Stupid rule. Oh god! My ring is caught! - Get someone to turn it off! Go get someone! Go! - [Grace] Help, we need some help here! - Don't you walk away from me! - Report me! - I will! - The machines are antiquated! - There's nothing wrong with our equipment! - Nothing wrong with the equipment! Bernie's got six, seven, and nine are all making metal! They're worn out! - Well we can't afford to fix 'em! - Oh well that's it then. That's the bottom line, it's about the money. - If the workers just used the machine properly-- - It's not about workers, it's about greed! It's cheaper to patch up the employees than it is to modernize the mill! - Ruben, if you will just draft a report, we'll fix it all. - You're not gonna do a damn thing. There's a dozen of my reports on your desk right now! You want something more efficient, take this down. This place is a danger zone. - [Osteen] What do you think you're listening in! - [Jake] How's she doing at work? - Fine. She hasn't really been herself. She hasn't even been going out. - That's an improvement isn't it? I thought that's what you wanted. - I think it's the house. She's clinging to it. - She'll get over it. - Not so sure. She's pretty determined. - Two more minutes. Hello. Frannie you there? - Is this the underwear map? - Well we distribute to all the red dots. - That's the whole state plus. - You did what? - I put these cards in the underwear asking anyone if anybody knew where daddy was. And I told them to call me. Brilliant? - How dare you jeopardize your job and-- - I don't care about my job. - Well I care about mine. You cannot use the factory as a detective agency. - When I find daddy, he's gonna be so-- - Forget about him, he forgot about us. - No he hasn't. I'm planting sage. I bet daddy loves fresh herbs. - He never struck me as the herb type. - Everything's gonna work out Nat. You'll see. - This is gonna blow up in your face. Like everything, every idiotic plan you ever had. Another Frannie bomb. - Daddy cried the night he left us. Did you know that? When I talked to him, his voice was all, broken. - You're making that up. - No I'm not. I bet he still cries about us. - Frannie, you know we have to sell this place. Jake says the taxes alone-- - Tell Jake to keep his nose out of this. - The yearly taxes are $4,600! - I'm getting a second job. I've saved already $200. Plus the money that mama left. Don't worry, it's under control. - If you expect me and Jake to sit around for 50 years-- - Yeah who is Jake anyway? Jake, some little bank clerk that works in a little bank in the mall. That doesn't give him the right to make decisions for us. - And you have no right to forfeit our future. - I told you I'd take care of things. - I'm the one who takes care of things Frannie. "Natalie will do it." That's all I ever heard. Nobody ever asked you to do anything. All you had to do was be beautiful and make people laugh. - Well when you're not the smart one sometimes you end up being the clown. Ew, it's bitter. I thought sage was sweet? How come everything's different now? - We put the place on the market Frannie. - God. I like the way things used to be. I used to be somebody's daughter. I'm not anybody's daughter now. Who am I now Nat? You know what the problem is? We don't have fun anymore. Let's go to the fair. Mama would want us to. She loved fairs. (slow paced music) (indistinct chatter) I hope they have the pig races. And the biggest hog contest. Can we stay til night so we can have corn in the cob and ribs? Big hogs don't make good barbecue. Did you know that Jake? I always thought it was odd because the only thing that they can be is like lard or sausage. I always thought the prize should go to the tastiest hog. - I'm sorry, but I just never knew you know so much about livestock. - A lot of things you don't know. - You wanna bite? Sweet huh? - Not as sweet as you. - [Narrator] Alright, come on in now! - Frannie. - Get you one of these little porkers in one minute and you win $200! - $200? - Frannie. - [Frannie] $200. - You're out of your mind. - I need the money. - You can't catch a pig. - Yeah, just watch me. - [Narrator] Now who's next! - Me, I'm next. - Come on in here now. That sure is a short skirt for pig scrambling. (laughing) - Ah piggies, hi, hi, hi. Hey, I don't like bacon okay. - Come on young lady, we ain't got time for y'all to develop a relationship! (laughing) - Be nice, I'm really a nice person. - Alright shorty, set 'em up in there now. - Okay, I'm ready. - Let 'em go shorty! (fast paced music) (squealing) She's got one minute! - [Frannie] Come here! Hey hey hey! Stop! (squealing) - Lookout now! - Come on! - She's done it! - Yes! - She gave us old men some sweet dreams to boot! - Take me home. - Congratulations young lady. - Thank you. - Disgusting. - Well, you sure made a fool out of yourself Francis. - Oh you make a fool out of yourself every time you open your mouth Jake. - Don't you ever talk to Jake like that again. - Hi piggies, I bet you guys could get a farm going. Hi. - [Narrator] Hi. - How much would one cost? - $75. Feeder pigs are high now. - Would you sell me three for 200? - Cut the price? Oh I don't know. - Cash. - Oh, cash. That's different. Pick out any three you want, back your truck up, and you'll be in the pig farming business. - My truck? - Can't be a pig farmer without a truck honey. - Don't worry, I'm a pig farmer. I am very definitely a pig farmer. Do pigs nap this time of day? - Well they sleep on and off all the time. Why? - Well I was thinking I could put them in my car while they're sleeping. - Oh I don't think so. - Or my trunk. I could leave it open a little so they can breathe. - They're your pigs. (squealing) - Thank you. (perky music) (squealing) (loud ripping) What the? Oh no, you can't. Oh no. Now you go back. Oh no, no, no. (screaming) Back in the trunk. Come on piggy, piggy. Oh no, no, no. Oh no no no no. Oh oh. Go back to the trunk with your friends, come on. Take your friends back. That's it! (tires screeching) Oh no, no! No, go back! No. Can you go back. Come on, go back. Come on little piggy, go back with your friends. - What's going on? - Help me stuff 'em in the trunk. - What are you doing with those pigs? - I'm gonna start a pig farm. Then I can pay you your share of the place, okay? - What, what did she say? - This is none of your business Jake. - Take those things back. - I can't. - [Nat] Why not? - We bonded. - I happen to know for a fact the county frowns upon-- - Screw your facts Jake! They're my pigs, they're going back to my place. - Then you can figure out how to get them there. (slow quirky music) - Recognized your car. - You did? - Yeah, it's unique. Looks like you could use a little help there. Why don't I give 'em a lift. - Oh I'd really appreciate that. - Hey, you still got those pens? - Yeah. We got us a ride piggies. Be careful. - How'd you know where everything was? The pig pen and everything. - Well I've been here before. - You have? When? I don't remember. I don't even remember hearing anything about you. - Well it was a long time ago. We used to buy eggs from your granddaddy. Come out here with my father on a Sunday afternoon. Sometimes we'd buy a chicken. Thanksgiving we'd come and get us a fresh turkey. - What did my grandpa look like? - Your grandpa? Well let's see, he was tall. About my height, leaner. And he was tan, he was always tan, even in the winter. And he had big hands. Big knotty looking hands, strong hands. - What color were his eyes? - You don't believe me do ya? - What color? - Same color as your eyes. Except he wore glasses. Now I'll tell you something that you didn't know. My mom and your grandma were friends. Did you know that? - No. - Her eyes were blue. - Well, I'd invite you in for coffee but my sisters a little mad at me. - It's alright. - Anyway. - Anyway. Yeah, it's a fine old place alright. - Yeah it is. - I don't know, it's just something about it. It seems like, home. Sorry about your mama passing Frannie. - Thank you Ruben. - Hey you know, I remembered something else about your granddaddy. He was very serious and good. He was a good person, like you. - Me, good? No I'm not. No I'm good, but I'm a mess. I mean if you knew me, if you really knew you'd run. - Frannie. - Where have you been anyway? I mean everybody knows how I am. - Everybody's wrong. Maybe sometime, well maybe I can take a rain check on that coffee huh? - I can't. Sorry, I'm sorry. Natalie! - So Sheriff says, "Charlie you'll be gone on parole. "Is there a problem?" He says, "Yeah I'm drunk you fool." - [Narrator] Hey Frannie. - Hi, long time no see. - Hey. - Hey. - How 'bout a drink? - Do I know you? - Not yet. - I feel like I've had amnesia and I'm just waking up. What'd you say your name was? - Ted. Ted Bass. - You know what Ted, being good gets old. - Yeah you gotta cut loose every once in a while. - Yeah. - Wanna dance? (slow paced music) - Yeah. - Let's go. - Did you hear the one about the pet duck? - No. - A man took his pet duck into a feed store, buy him some stuff. The man who owned the feed store said "Cash or charge?" The man who owned the duck said, "Put it on his bill." (chuckling) Get it? Duck bill? Did you hear the one about the man whose wife was sick? - Are you hungry? - Am I talking too much? My mama just died. Did I say that already? Hey, we're supposed to be having fun. - Come on. - Where? - Outside. - Okay handsome. I like to laugh. That's why I tell the jokes, you know? No really, don't. Wait a minute. Stop okay! Stop it! Stop it! - What are you? A tease? Everybody knows you. You're Frannie the good time girl. - Why don't you go back inside and tell everybody the good times are over. (tires screeching) - So how are your pigs? - Fine. - You sure about that? - Yeah why? - I don't know, you look-- - What, rotten? - Worried. - I went out last night. - That's nice. - No it's not. I didn't even invite you in for a glass for water. And then I go and do something. I'm a mess. - Well we could sure use some rain huh? - Rain makes me sleepy. Storms are better. (laughing) What? - Nothing, you make me laugh. - That's me, the joker. - I heard that about you. - I picked up another jerk last night. Did you hear that too? - No. - Well I felt I should tell you. - You don't owe me anything Frannie. - Maybe he wasn't a jerk, maybe I was. Anyway, nothing happened. Surprised him. Surprised me too. We're almost friends huh? - Almost. - It's strange. - What is? - Most guys would've been all over me by now. - Since you like jokes, I made up a joke okay. Knock knock. Knock knock. - Oh, who's there? - Do we. - [Frannie] Do we who? - Do we wanna have lunch together. (laughing) - Ruben. That's so sad. - Well it's my first joke. (laughing) - It's really bad, do we. - Well? - Now? - It is lunchtime yeah. - Out in public? - I think that's what friends do, yeah. - Well yeah, I guess. I mean how would I know? Did you hear the one about this lady and her geese? There was this knock-kneed lady-- (laughing) Wait, Ruben, wait for the punchline. Okay, so she takes him out for a walk. - You're gonna land us in jail. You and your ridiculous schemes. - What did I do? - You might have lost me my job Frannie. I knew this would happen, I knew it. (light knocking) - I'm not (speaks too low). - [Frannie] I know. - That's your name is it not? And your address? - Yes sir. - Well a customer called us. She found that card in a package of our underwear. Now according to that card, you're looking for? - My father. - You're fired Ms. Vaughn. - Oh I can't be. Really, I can explain. See, when my mama died, I didn't have anyone left. I mean nobody. Sure I have Natalie my sister, but she has Jake. Anyway, I just knew if I could find my father I could be somebody's daughter again. So when I saw the map I figured-- - Ms. Vaughn. - Please? (slow paced music) - You're killing me Frannie. - I'm only suspended Natalie. Mr. Osteen said I could come back in two weeks. - Look at you, you and that damn pig. She thinks she's a dog. I'm sick of worrying about you. - Do you wanna hit me? Make you feel better. Come on, go ahead. Hit me in the head. Hit me hard. - Don't be ridiculous. Tempting. - Nat, I love you. Did you know Ruben used to come here a long time ago? - Mm hmm. - Really? Well where was I anyway? - You're never gonna slaughter her are ya? - Alice, are you kidding? I love her like a sister. - So much for pig farming. (ringing) - Hello. - [Narrator] Are you the person looking for Frank Vaughn? - Nat! I found him, I found daddy! Hello, yes I am the person looking for Frank Vaughn. (slow quirky music) - Francis? Violet Vaughn. So, I'm his third wife. I thought I was his second wife. He never mentioned a wife over in-- - Silk Hope. It's about 200 miles from here. - He never mentioned any children either. There's two of ya? - Yes ma'am. - That's Frank alright. A lot of things he never mentioned. Like why he couldn't hold down a job for more than six months at a time. - I get that from him. - And why he couldn't go a single day without liquor. - I guess you called because you found my note. - My son found it. In a brand new package of underwear. You don't ignore a note in a pair of men's underwear. - Sorry. - Did you love your daddy? So did I. A long long time ago. - Do you know where my father is? - Honey, everybody knows where Frank Vaughn is. (slow paced music) - Hi. Do you know a man named Frank Vaughn? - Are you kidding? He practically qualifies as a resident. I'll tell him you're looking for him. Frank, you got a woman at the end of the bar who wants to talk to ya. She was there. (slow paced music) (faint thundering) - All my life all I dreamed about is how great it would be to see my daddy again. I couldn't wait for him to hug me and tell me how much he loved me. And when I found him, I just ran. - I'm sorry Fran. - He's just a drunk. - I know. - How do you know? - Mama told me. He treated you like a China doll but he made her life miserable. - Why didn't she tell me? - You were never here. He was a rotten husband Frannie. - Why didn't anyone tell me? - [Nat] Or is that just your hair? Bonnet. - It is? It is. Look here. Who is this? - I think that's great great grandma Delia. - I wonder what she was like. - Nobody ever talked about her. - Why? - I don't know, some sort of family secret. - She looks like this blissful kind of free spirit. - She looks a little like you. - Oh. I wonder why everybody wanted to keep you a secret Delia? - [Narrator] It's my fine point. - I see, I see. - Come on kids. (squealing) Oh don't worry, they're tamed. This is Alice's favorite room. Oh good, you're here. I was just about to tell them about our pet termites. (squealing) Well, aren't they cute? Where are you going? - As far away from you as I can get. - Why? - I'll be staying with Jake and his parents. - You're leaving me alone? Why? - Because I'm sick of you and your irresponsible behavior. Because I want a decent life with a husband and a home of my own. Because I want some peace, which is something you will never comprehend. And if you think your little show managed to stop anything you're mistaken. Those people had no interest in the house, it's the property they want. (slow paced music) - We're alone now Alice. It's a bad day. Yeah, it's a real bad day. It's a lost day. It's a lost sister day. Oh my, it's not a good day at all is it? - Just think, this time next year we're gonna be married, be sitting at our own table. - Will we ever afford it Jake? - Oh yeah, once we sell that house of yours. Natalie? - Sorry. - You're still worried about Francis? She's gonna end up like mama. Alone, dumped by some drunk. - She'll always have us. - We're gonna have to take care of her. - We already do. (clanking) (screaming) - Somebody! Somebody help me please! Help me! - Shut down four! - Help help me please! My arm! - Turn off four! - Help me! - [Narrator] What's happening! (grunting) - Somebody turn it off! (loud ringing) Somebody please! - Get somebody on it! - Quick, tell me a joke. - Okay. I can't think of a punchline. - Get him! - [Narrator] One, two, three! - I'm going. - [Narrator] Alright, button it up. - [Narrator] Clear, go, go, go! (siren blaring) - How is he? - I don't know. - Sit down. - The doctors won't let anybody see him. His arm is gone. - [Coworker] Take a deep breath. - Nobody's allowed to visit him yet. I mean how's that gonna make him feel? No visitors. No arm. Oh. (slow paced music) Natalie would know exactly what to do. She'd know exactly what to say. - Excuse me miss. - Yes. - Hi. How's it going? Oh. Joke book. What did he want? Mr. Osteen. - Well he said everything's gonna be fine and that he's gonna take care of everything. - I bet. Hey, how's the food here? Let's see. Yuck, awful. I'll bring pizza next time. - It's nice of you to come. - Well thank you Ruben. You kicking me out? - I just meant I know you're busy. - At least you got a view. Onion or meatball? On the pizza. - You don't have to bother with me. - I'll splurge, pizza with everything. Sorry, excuse me. I'm sorry. - Are you a nurse? - No, I'm just a friend from the factory. - You must be Francis. - Yes. - Oh may I have a look at you darling? - [Frannie] Oh yes. - Oh, you know you sound like your mother. How are you? - Fine. Spectacular actually. - Ruben's depressed and frightened. Needs someone to cheer him up. I hear you're very good at that. - Sure, naturally. It was very nice meeting you Mrs. Mason. - Arlene, Arlene. What time will you be here tomorrow? - Well I don't think he's up to a lot of visitors right now. - What time dear? Noon? - Yes ma'am. Bye bye. - Bye. (slow paced music) - I used to detest housework Alice. Now I can't wait to get home and start scrubbing. I cracked up huh? Looks beautiful. But what's wrong? It's too quiet. We need some people here. Lots of people with plates of food on their lap and music, kids crawling around on the floor making a mess so Natalie could pace around nervously picking up all the little crumbs. We'd just have fun. We need some people Alice. We do. - [Ruben] You know you shouldn't of taken time off from work to come down here. - I didn't, it's my lunch break. So I can't stay long. - You shouldn't be here at all. - Why? Why not? - Because I don't want your pity. I don't want you cutting up my pizza, wiping my chin off. I don't need it - I have no intention of wiping off your chin Ruben. And I don't feel sorry for you okay. I'm concerned. Move over. What? What'd I do? - Nothing. My mother put you up to this? - Nah. I mean she prodded me along a little bit. But I was coming back the whole time. - Good. - I've known a ton of guys, but nothing like you. You're different. - I was always here. - I wasn't. I mean I was here but I wasn't really. - I know. I know, I used to watch you. - Watch me? - Mm hmm. I went to your farm once. I guess I was 12 you were probably 14. A woman. I was too intimidated to talk to you. I promised myself I would. I had it all planned out. What I was gonna say, what you were gonna say. Anyway, my dad and I got there. You were all dressed in faded overalls and pigtails. And all I could do is stand there and look at you. I was just a foot away from you but the words wouldn't come. I guess my dad knew I had a crush on you. He took your grandpa, went into the barn. I guess he thought if he'd leave me alone long enough with you that I'd get the nerve to speak. - Did you? - No. - Shoot. I wish you would of. Then I could be different. You could of help me become normal. - Well now, why'd I wanna do that? Hmm? Why would anyone wanna change you Frannie Vaughn? - Ruben said that you and my gran were friends. - Best friends dear. - Did she ever mention my great great grandma? - Delia. - Yes. What was she like? - Your great great grandma Delia had plenty of passion. She was married to a good man really. One day she met a man who made her sick with love. He promised to take her away. Far away from North Carolina. All the way to a farm he had in Kentucky. She left her family and she and this man traveled for weeks until they reached his homestead. Where she was to begin her new life. One day Delia saw a man she'd known from her old home. "How'd you come to be in Kentucky" she said. "Well Delia" he said, "we're nowhere near Kentucky. "This is North Carolina." - North Carolina? - Her lover had taken her around in circles all that time. She was only seven miles from home. She'd left him. Came back here to Silk Hope. - To her husband? - He took her back. But the community didn't. They refused to forgive her. Finally she had a child. - Great grandma Rose. - Yes, Rose. When Delia's husband died, community turned their backs on her. She had no one to turn to. Finally she was forced to return to the man who tricked her. - I thought family stories were supposed to have happy endings? Poor Delia. Hey. - Hey. - How ya doing today? - I'm doing good. I'm doing good. - What's that? - They want me to sign the termination papers. - What? - Well they think because I'm disabled now that-- - Did you tell him to stuff it? - They're offering me a settlement Frannie. - What was all that rehab stuff for Ruben? To work right? Or don't you think you can still do the job? - Oh I can still do the job with one hand tied behind my back. (laughing) - That's funny. I knew you had a sense of humor. I'm sorry. - For what? - It's not any of my business really. - No it is your business. I care about what you think. - You do? - Yeah. - Why? - 'Cause I admire you. You know I live, most of us running around doing what we think we're supposed to do and I'll tell you what. After going through what I've been through, makes you stop and think. I'm not putting things off anymore. Fun is a part of life. And you always knew that. - Well I kinda overdid the fun part. - Yeah but at least you did it. - Uh huh. - Don't be scared Frannie. - You can't fire Ruben. He's the best foreman y'all have ever had. I mean check out the statistics. His line is way more productive than anybody elses. - His past performance isn't the point. Because of his disability, he's now a safety hazard. - Why don't you ask the assembly line workers if they feel safer with him or without him. I have a petition with 30 names on it demanding his return. - Employees don't decide who'll be foreman here Francis! I do! - Well they're prepared to go to the states safety board about the mills flagrant disregard for their safety. - Now there's no proof of willful negligence. - Oh really? Well I wonder why that reporter from the Raleigh News and Observer has been nosing around. He's left Ruben a dozen messages. You know they're gonna write an expose on the mill. One of those Pulitzer prize things. - What was the name of that guy again? - Who? - The reporter. - Oh I just made that part up. (chuckling) - Alright, this is ready. Where do you want to go where? - Petunias. - Petunias. - Sweet peas. - Sweet peas. - And Zinnias in the corner. - I thought we were having watermelon in the corner? - Oh. - [Ruben] Something I can do for ya? - Mind if we take a look around? - Yes I do. - Well we plan on making an offer on the property if it meets our-- - No sale. - But I spoke with the realtor this morning. - Well, we changed our mind. - Are you sure about this? - Positive. Don't lecture me. - I'm not gonna say a word. - A person can't let go of something they love without a fight. - Couldn't agree with you more. - It's my home Ruben. - I think it's time we celebrate me getting out of the hospital. How about if I take you to dinner tomorrow night? - How about I make you dinner tomorrow night? Deviled chicken. - How 'bout that. - Match my mood. (light music) Oh my. (perky music) Oh! Oh no! No! Why? - What'd you put in this gravy? - The usual. Nothing special. Save room for pie. Coconut cream. - Home cooked pie. - Well, country cooked. (loud clanking) (squealing) Oh Alice - [Ruben] Looks like Alice likes country cooking too. - [Frannie] I wanted to do something great for you. - You did. (squealing) (slow paced music) - Well now, I talked it over with our legal advisor here. And we all agree. We want you back on the job! (chuckling) (slow paced music) - Sure is a beautiful night. - It's so peaceful. - I got another knock knock joke. - You do? Okay. - Knock knock. - Who's there? - Do we. - Do we again. Okay, Do we who? - Do we wanna get married? - Ruben, can I ask you something? Was that a joke? - No. - Do we? Yes we do. Oh yes. (slow paced music) I chose grandma's dress instead of mama's because grandma had a great marriage. Mama wasn't so lucky. - Who'd of thought you'd beat me to the altar. - Well you and Jake are such slow pokes. Mama'd be crazy about Ruben huh? - You did exactly what she wanted Frannie. - 'Cause I've gone and settled down. - No, 'cause you're happy. That's all mama ever wanted. - Yeah. - I Ruben, take thee Frannie to be my lawful wedded wife. To have and to hold from this day forward, til death do us part. - I Frannie, take thee Ruben to be my lawful wedded husband. To have and to hold from this day forth, til death do us part. - I now pronounce you man and wife. (cheering) (applauding) - Everybody ready? You're next Natalie! - I love it. Perfect. - Well of course it's perfect. It's a model home. - [Nat] Just what we've been looking for. - It's too big for us. - We'll grow into it. - We can't afford it. - We'll use the money we get from selling the farm. - I just think we should have the marriage first and then the house. - What are we waiting for Jake? Tell me, what are we waiting for? - Listen baby, I've got some bad news. Jake came by, they got a firm offer. - We can't sell the house. - It's a good offer Frannie. And technically the house is in Natalie's name. - We love this place. Natalie doesn't. - I know that. - Look, it's a letter from Delia. "My dearest Rose, how could I have been so foolish? "I brought shame to my family and myself. "I still suffer. "Reliving the humiliation." Ruben, she's talking about that man. You know the one who tricked her. "So much so that I'm afraid I shall "end my days here in Wildwood." - Wildwood sanitarium? - [Frannie] Wasn't it-- - It's an insane asylum. - Poor Delia. "What is left of me is sum of money. "I'm determined to put this money to good use. "We must build a home in Silk Hope for you Rose "and for all the generations of women to come." Listen. "The house must stay in the family and never be sold. "So that no matter what happens between "them and the men in their lives, "they'll have a home, a safe haven. "Love Delia." - How's Alice? - Sweetheart, I don't think Frannie invited us here to discuss her pigs. We've accepted the offer. You'll get 50% of whatever we-- - I'm not moving out. - It's from Delia. - It's real clear. This house has to stay in the family. - Francis. - You know the feeling I've had about the house? It all makes sense now. It's like Delia was guiding me almost. - This letter is not legal and binding. You talk some sense into her Ruben. - She's making perfect sense Jake. - You know what, sometimes I ask about Delia but mama would get vague. - Alright, Francis I think that what you're doing to Natalie is unfair. You are forcing her to choose between us. Besides, that piece of paper would not stand a chance in a court of law. - What about the laws of the heart Jake? I guess you don't know about that. - I'm glad that we've worked out some financial arrangement Ruben. And I'm pleased that you'll still be a part of the family. - Family my eyeball. You could have gotten a ton of money Ruben. They owe you. - I don't need a ton of money. I got everything I want right here Frannie. Go on, take it. It's enough to buy out Natalie. This will be our home now. We'll raise our children here. We'll tell them about you in overalls and me being too shy to speak. We'll tell them about Rose and Delia and they'll protect this land and take care of it and they'll pass it on to their daughters. - When we have a little girl, can we call her Delia? - You bet we can. - Yes. Hi Nat. - [Ruben] Hi Nat. - What's wrong? Did he do something to you? Did he call off the wedding? - He lost all the money, he's gone. - I knew it. I knew he was up to something. I'm gonna hit him so hard. - He invested, he bought on the margin. He didn't tell me. - So the jerk lost all your money? - I kept asking him when we were gonna move, when we were gonna get married. He kept making up excuses. He knew the money was gone, he didn't have the guts to tell me. - I'm gonna kill him. - He didn't do it on purpose Frannie. - It's not the money that hurts. Not being able to trust him hurts the most. - Well you came to the right place. - She sure did. - That's why Delia built this house. So we'd have a safe place. - No matter what. - No matter what.
