See if there are any fruits over there. -Here? There. Take a look. You have to look for them! Let me see. Are those fruits ripe? They seem to be ripe. Yes. You may pick them. Isn't there one over there? There? -You have to find the riper ones. Where's your strength? Harder! Good! We almost got it. Thank you so much, my child. You're strong. Very good! Thank you, Manawei, you've picked a lot of longan fruits. Thank you. There are more here. A rich harvest! Now when your dad comes back, he can have as many longan fruits as he wants! Come! There're more here. So many have fallen. Don't you want this one? Be careful! Don't hit me! Move aside! Careful or you'll hit me! Oops. You dropped them! They're quite pricy, eh? Get them back for me and I'll give you $100. I get paid? $200 then! Fine. Yeah! $200! I've got them! Here you are. Long Time No Sea Uncle, I delivered the tatala boat to the customer. Here's your $1,000 note. Why is it wet? What happened? Because I helped a customer find his sunglasses. I jumped into the sea, so the note got wet. Hold it down with that little boat, or it might get blown away. Okay. And uncle, look, he gave me $200! Because I got his sunglasses back. Save the money and spend it with Grandma. Hm. Don't squander it. Uncle, let me help you. Okay, you polish that side. There and here. They're not polished yet. Okay. Not like this. Look at me. Polish here first. This is where you'll stay. Can I change for another room? This is only one I have. Only this one? Only this one. No other options Okay, thank you. Put down your bags, take it easy. Excuse me. Is there an air conditioner? No, but I can get you a fan. Is that okay? Yes. Get some rest. Here's your fan. Thank you. Eat more. You like it? Hello? Daddy, aren't you coming back? We picked so many longan fruits for you. Isn't the typhoon already gone? I know. I saw it on TV. But my shoes are worn out. I drew my feet and mailed it to you. Can you buy me new shoes, please? Or, can I go to Kaohsiung to see you? But... The train's not running? Granny? Dad said his car was in water because of the typhoon, and the train's not running, so he can't take the ferry from Taitung. But isn't there a ferry in Pingtung? It's okay, no need to wait for him. Let's eat first. Why wait for him? Let's eat first. Come on, let's eat. This again? Granny, I don't want this. No? Then what do you want? I cooked so many taros and sweet potatoes for you. And there's fresh fish… I want to eat noodles. Are those noodles better than the fresh fish from home? I just want noodles! I have earned my own money. I just want noodles with pork chops right now. Why do you want to eat that? We've got plenty of food at home. Your uncle brought us such a big and fresh fish. Come on! sit down. No! Why can others have fried chicken and hot dogs, but you always ask me to eat fish! What? What's wrong with eating fish? My parents brought me up with the same food. Eating fried chicken and what dogs everyday… -Not everyday! Why are you angry with me? How can you be so childish? How can you treat me like this? If you're this unhappy, move out and go live with someone else then! Just leave me alone! Then move out! Get out of here! I spent so much time cooking for you. Who gives you the right to be angry with me? Hello. -Evening. I'd like a glass of Cuba Libre. Okay, wait a second. Hello? Excuse me, brother, you busy? Right, don't you have some cocktail recipes? Someone ordered a cocktail. Okay, thanks. I got it. Okay, bye. I'm sorry… It's fine. No worries. Here it is. Thanks. Is this a… "Cheat Sheet Special"? Well, the owner took a leave today. I'm standing in for him. So… I am a bit unfamiliar with things around here. Give it a try first. It's not bad. Any discount if I order another glass of the "Cheat Sheet Special"? No. You've got a donation box here. Oh, it's because the owner knows them well, he's raising money for them. Why don't I also make a donation? And, I also have the check, please. Okay, wait a second. I'm sorry, but… Are there any places nearby to withdraw cash? Now? I need to withdraw some cash, I'll be right back. Now? Yeah. Manawei… What are you doing here? Granny has been looking for you. You've made me so worry about you. Don't you want to eat something? Aren't you hungry? Granny bought you some fried rice, Looks great, eh? Eat. Don't starve yourself. See? Full of rice and pork. Eat more. Come on. What's wrong? Still mad at me? Still no smile on your face. Pork! Yummy, eh? Feeling better? You're happy now? Cheeky monkey! Over here! Help put that away. So many! Good morning, everyone. I'm your new teacher. When I call your name, tell me how you did with your summer assignment. What's your name? Hsiao Shu-chun. Your homework? I did only one page. Excuse me? Mr. Chou. This is Shih Chia-hsiang. It's you! Who else would it be? I'm your new teacher. Go find a seat at the back. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chou. I'll get back to you if there are any problems. Okay. Shih Chia-hsiang, Why are you late on the first day of school? I forgot about it. You forgot about the first day of school? Show me your homework. Did you do your homework? Stand up and answer me. No. No? And you? How about your summer assignment? Two pages. And you? I did five pages. Why are you still laughing? Do you think it's funny? Those at the back, stop slacking! Carry on! Rest briefly and carry on! Teachers, the clip you're watching is a dance competition for the Taiwanese aboriginal children. Has any one of the four primary schools on Orchid Island ever participated in this competition? We're already quite busy catching up with classwork everyday, I don't think we'll be able to find time to practice this as well. I'm thinking… If there's a teacher willing to step up and organize a team for this competition, the school is willing to offer extra days off and give merit and rewards. Okay? I think they've got pretty good logical thinking as well. Sir, I'll give them extra lessons after school. Good, please do. Thank you. I'm off then. -Sure, off you go. Mr. Chou! Sir! Chung-hsun! Good day, sir. How's your leg? It's fine. Much better now. You mentioned about organizing a dance team during the meeting, actually, I would like to give it a try. He's quite tall. He's quite tall... -Yeah. That's him. Over there! I've got a lot of ideas for the choreography, the choice of music and how to carry out the practices. Good, I'll leave it to you then. Great! Thank you, sir! That's him? Can I help you? We need to talk to this teacher about something that happened in the village the other day. Car accident? -Yeah. I'm so sorry, school started and I just forgot. I was too busy. Sorry for all your trouble, I should've given you the money that day. It's okay. Brother, let's forget it. Look at his leg. I don't think he's lying. Fine, at least we've got an explanation. That's all. Let's go then. Come on. Your cap. Let's go. -Thank you. Okay. Watch this! Wow! It bounced off three to four times! No, only once! Watch carefully, this is super skipping! Ha, ha, ha, you fell! This is gonna be superb. Watch this! How many times? 365 times! See? I don't believe it! I haven't lost yet! I haven't lost! I'm just taking a break for today. A break…Let's get out of here! I won! See that? God has descended so it's brightest over there. Right. Jesus has come! It's just the sun, okay? Jesus is coming. -Buddy, don't be like this… Your shoe split again. It's such a big hole. Look! You can see the toes! Hello ma'am. -Hello. You're back? What happened to your leg? I fell from the motorbike. Be careful! Excuse me, ma'am. What's the traditional dance of Orchid Island? Weiwei, there are so many colors! Your dad bought them? No way. My mom bought them. How could my dad afford this? My mom bought all these toys too. Toys? You've got so many toys! What's this? It's a race car. It's awesome playing it in the evening. What does it do? Why do you have to play at night? -It lights up and plays music! Really? Let's take it to the square tomorrow. Sure. -Yes! That's it. No? What's that? A toy? No, they're shoes. Shoes? Wow, so nice. New shoes for the new school term. They're air cushioned too! I won't wear them till the New Year. The New Year? Why wait so long? By that time your feet will be too big for them. No way! My mom intentionally buys me a bigger size. Bigger? It fits! Hey, what are you doing? They're mine. Your feet are so dirty! Look! Don't be so stingy, I'll just brush it off. Can I open this? Suit yourself. Wow, lucky you. Your mom makes so much money and buys you so many things. You're so lucky! I got injured in a motorbike accident. Nothing is going well. Hello. Again? Why can't you come over? I know you're busy. But I'm still your boyfriend, right? Yeah. Or let's just break up. Okay okay, I was just kidding. No, of course no, I was just kidding. I'm disappointed that you're not coming. Alright. Copy down the questions correctly to get the answers correct. This is A… The side of A… Shih Chia-hsiang! Is your clock broken? We don't have a clock at home. What do you mean? So you can be late because you don't own a clock? Do a lap of frog jumps around the field! |… Wait! Why do you wear slippers to school? Why? Any more excuses? Another lap of frog jumps! Go! What are you staring at? Concentrate on your work! 1, 2.1, 2. 1, 2. Hands on the chest. Keep dancing. Look over here. 1, 2. Very good. Dance to the tempo. Be careful. Very good. Excuse me, Mr. Chou. Did you see Manawei today? Manawei? I didn't see him since morning. He skipped school again today? Yeah. Are these your slippers? Speak! No… What's that in your hands? Some one gave me lobsters. Keep lying, eh? They told me you stole it! You're a student from Yayo Primary School, are you not! Let's go! I'll take you to your teacher. No… Get on! Come on! Let's go! So that's your house? -Yeah. So, Shih Chia-hsiang wearing slippers to school has affected the other students in class… Grandma, do you know about this? Yes, his father said he would buy him new shoes in Taiwan, So we keep waiting and waiting, but nothing has come. I was a bit tough on him last time, he should've just told me that. So… Manawei's father is in Taiwan? Yes, he works in Taiwan. Has he ever come back? Yes. He would come back for a few days and then go to Taiwan again. The boy… Sometimes I try to teach him things, but he just doesn't listen to me. I don't blame him. When I come back from work, I see him alone at home. Seeing him like that, I feel sorry. He's like an orphan. Hm. From tomorrow onwards, I'll come pick you up for school. If you have any questions, I'll give you extra lessons. As for your shoes, before you get new ones, it's fine to wear slippers to school. You can talk to me about anything, got it? Thank you, sir. I will go now. Hello again! Good day. What are you doing here? I came to cover for my aunt. Don't you have a job? You keep standing in for others. I do, I work at the radio station. The radio station! That's cool! -Yeah. Have you ever taught kids dancing? No, it's my first time. It's not gonna be easy. It's alright, I'll just give it a try. Should we get going? Yeah, it's about time. I'll go and get the kids. Let's go. -Okay. How's your leg? It's a lot better. I can move it freely now. Right foot, left foot… Hello everyone. I'm Chin-yi. I'm substituting for your teacher today. Why don't you dance first, and let me see how much you've learned, okay? Okay, 1, 2, 3, 4. Louder. Okay, very well. Lower. Louder. Okay, can you form a circle with me? Come! Form a circle. Okay, right. Here… There… Good. Hey, Manawei. I heard that you guys are going to Taiwan to dance? Yeah. You're going to wear thongs! No! We're not wearing that! No, we're not! - The teacher didn't mention it. - You are, I heard about it. You have to wear thongs when you do the dance. You'll know soon! Really? Here it is. Here. Put it down. I'll cook it later. Okay. Should I take it off? It's fine. Keep it for now. Okay. Mom! Manawei! Daddy! What brought you back? When did you arrive? This afternoon. I took the last plane today. Mom. It's good that you're back. My grandson has been waiting for you to come home. He almost cries from missing you. I'll get the chopsticks for you. Okay, go. My son, it's good you're back. Why did you come back so suddenly? You really surprised me. I didn't tell you because I wasn't sure. I was on the waiting list, and wasn't sure if I could get on the plane. I'm so glad you're home. We almost cry when thinking about you. That boy misses you every day. I miss you, but my grandson misses you even more. Hello. I've been calling you for ages. A business trip abroad? So sudden.. Couldn't you just tell me first? It's always the same thing! I don't like him? It's not like that. You have to tell me first. It's not like you can't talk reason with me. Hey, don't… Don't keep saying things like that… Why don't you come to Orchid Island for your birthday? Let me celebrate your birthday with you. We can take long walks here and talk things over. Mom, this is for you. It'll keep you warm in the cold. I'm happy enough that you're home. It's my poor grandson… He's been waiting for you to come home every day. It's not easy to make money out there, so don't spend it unnecessarily next time. This feels nice. It'll keep you warm when it gets cold, and it looks very good on you. I feel warm the moment I put it on. Thank you so much. Daddy, what about my shoes? Here. How can I forget about them? Here, Manawei, your shoes. Wow! Cool! It's a famous brand too. This is great, Manawei's finally got new shoes. Thank you, Daddy. Thank you so much. You finally brought the boy new shoes. You like them? Yes, so much! Daddy, they're too small. Did you get the wrong size? How can they be too small? You sent a drawing of your foot this one? I remember it was this one, right? How could I get the size wrong? It's your foot. You drew it yourself. Look now, you let the boy down. I followed the drawing he mailed me. Daddy, this isn't what I mailed you this time. I drew it when I was in the third grade. This time, I used white paper. Daddy got it wrong? It's okay, Manawei. Daddy knows the shop owner. I'll change them when I return to Kaohsiung. Manawei. Yeah. Morning! I'm the first! I'm the first! No, I'm the first! Here. You know what they are? Thongs. Yes. -Sir? Why are you giving these to us? It's because… open it. It's what you're going to wear in the dance. Why this? People will laugh at us showing out butts. Well, what do you want to wear then? Underpants. Underpants? Yes. Haven't you seen the elderly wear thongs? Yes. These are for old people. We kids don't wear them. Our butts are more covered with underpants. Yeah! Yeah. So you really think it's better to wear underpants? Yes. But we're going to a competition! We represent the Tao on Orchid Island. Kids from the other tribes, like the Payuan and the Puyuma, all wear their traditional clothes! But they're long-sleeved! So we, the Tao… Wear underpants? Yes. Yes? What's this! A Tao thong. Why don't you want to wear it! Are you not one of the Tao! We've worn it since the ancient times. You hear that? Go get changed now! All of you! Hurry up! And gather on the sports field. Move! Shih Chia-hsiang, what're you doing? Watch your steps. Follow the tempo! I'll start now. I'll dance with you, alright? Do we need to sing? Focus. No, you don't need to. 1, 2, 3, 4. Louder! Show me your spirit! Good. Go on. Very good. Imagine your hair moving like the waves. Yes. Good. Chung-hsun, I think they look a bit tired today. Probably it's because none of them wanted to put on the thong when we asked them to. They didn't want to wear it? No. Stop holding it. It won't fall. It won't fall down. Dance properly. But I feel something is missing in their heart. Missing? What do you mean? It's just that… That the traditional dance of Orchid Island is not simply about moves. Huh? I think they've got good moves, but there should be something deeper within the dance. If the kids don't care about it, I don't think they could convey the spirit of the dance. Everyone finished? Not yet. Eat up the mushrooms. There're still some vegetables. Anyone? No. I'm full. Full? So fast? There's still some meat left. Manawei, don't you love meat the most? No more. No? There's soup too. If you can still eat, let's not waste food, okay? Okay. If you really don't want anymore, go wash up, and come back for nap time. What's up, Tseng Wei-da? Can I take the food home? You want to take it home? Yeah. Who cooks for you at home? My dad. Where is he? He has some business to do in Taiwan. He has to be there for three days. And your mother? She works in Taiwan. And… They're divorced. Got it. Let's fill it up. Yes. Thank you, sir. Tseng Wei-da? Why don't you leave the lunch box with me? I'll put it in the fridge. Come get it after school. Yes, thank you, sir. Come on, wash up and get ready for nap time. Hello? Yeah, my scooter broke down. Yeah, it broke down. I'm pushing it. Hm, I'm fine. The birthday present I sent you… Did you get it? Can't we talk nicely? You're being really unfair to me! You… Forget it then. Thanks. Bye. You're listening to "Music On the Island" on the Voice of Orchid Island. Hello, Mr. Chung-hsun. Hello, everyone. Can you tell our listeners where you are from? I come from Kaohsiung. Oh, Kaohsiung. Orchid Island is a lot more beautiful than I expected. Not only the sea, the mountains, it's the people…they're… Actually, I've grown to love this place more and more. Hmm. When you first came, your family must have worried about you coming here. I remember you said you have a girlfriend. Was she reluctant to see you leave? Umm… My girlfriend was quite concerned, she didn't want me to come. It happens to most teachers who come here, if their partners stay in Taiwan. It feels like they've left someone behind. But I think… You're doing great work here. It's very meaningful to lead the school dance team. I think you've got great passion in teaching. I think you're doing great here. Are you alright? Can we stop recording for now? What's wrong? I'm sorry. I didn't… I didn't mean to upset you. I didn't mean to… Are you alright? Umm. She called yesterday and wanted to break up with me. Maybe it's because you're gone… I'm rubbish! I never told her the truth. You know why I'm coaching the dance team? I wanted to get the merit, so I can get out of here and go back to Taiwan. I don't like this place at all. You're probably just feeling pressured… I gotta go. Chung-hsun… Manawei, here. It's black! Look at mine. It's green. They're good friends. Daddy, is Kaohsiung near the sea? Of course, Kaohsiung is near the sea. Not only is Kaohsuing near the sea, but also there's the Love River in Kaohsuing. Haven't you heard about it? Love River? Can you swim in it? Of course you can! When the lights come out in the evening, it becomes beautiful. It's like swimming in a magical world. Wow. Then Daddy… When will you take me to Kaohsiung? I want to swim with you in the Love River. Brother, why didn't you tell me you were coming back? At least I would've gotten more lobsters. This is good enough. Why are you working so hard every day? I have to build the tatala boats and go fishing every day, what else can I do? You still go to the sea or up to the mountains every day? Aren't you tired? I need to look after Mother, and feed the pigs. So many things need to be done every day that I can never finish them. I really miss the old times when we went fishing together. We got so drunk once. It's nice to be home. Why don't you come back? It's nice to work at sea. Bottoms up! Cheers! My goodness! Dakaan? Have you got money? What money? You mean money… I've got a friend, he wants me to set up a drink stall in the night market with him. You can earn tens of thousands a day. How much do you need? Just this. What? You want two million? How would I have that much! Not two million, just two hundred thousand. I don't have that much, either. Are you joking? Aren't you driving a cab? What happened to you? You're happy to stay here forever? It's a really good and easy business. Why I would lie to you? I never lie to you, right? You can't lead a life like this. When will you make big money? What's wrong with you? Why are you quiet? But who else can I borrow money from? Don't you have hundreds of thousands in your account? What? How would I have so much money? Who told you that? Just give me however much you have. I'll try to make up for the rest. How can I give you that money? I'm saving it for my grandson's education in Taiwan. How else will we pay for his school later? I make that money within a few months. What are you worried about? Where will you get the rest of the money? You've already thrown money into the business, haven't you? Or else why would you need money? You're not conned by your friend, are you? My friend wouldn't lie to me! You think everyone is bad? The money I lent you last time, have you paid me back? Brother. Here you are! Yeah. Sit. What would you like? Orange juice. The same? Yeah. Good. Take a seat. They haven't started yet? At seven. They'll start at seven. I see. Can I sit here? Of course, please. Long time no see. Long time no see. Here you are. Thanks. Are you okay? Much better now. Thanks. You're welcome. What are they preparing for? A show? That's Mr. Hsien Yong-chuan, he will be singing a song he wrote in our mother tongue. A song he wrote in your mother tongue? Yeah. Good evening, I'm going to sing a song I wrote. It's called "Akokay." I wrote it for my daughter, who was not in Orchid Island and was studying in Taiwan. This is the song I wrote for her… My baby, when are you coming home? I miss you. My baby, when are you coming home? I long to see you. My dearest child… My dearest child… Do you remember when you said that dance is not just about the steps, and what matters more is what's in your heart. Yeah. I think I understand now. You understand? I want to start over. Will you help me? Yes. Touch it. It's very smooth. It really is! How do you say "boat" in your mother tongue? Ta-ta-la Yes. A big boat for ten is called "Cinegerang". Cinegerang Wow, everyone knows it! Only a Cinegerang can be used for the launching ceremony. Raise your arms! Nip it off. Nip off the withered leaves. They'll grow very fast. -If you see any snails, you can pick them off for the grandma. The fruits.. there'll be three to four fruits on one plant. Look carefully. You have to learn how to grow taros. Use more colors. Ms. Fang, who teaches us the Hair Dance, invites us to her friend's café for a dress rehearsal. So decorate the invitations beautifully. Very pretty! The sun could be rounder. Don't forget to write down whom you want to invite. Okay, the second one. Girls leave first. Come, girls. Boys, get in the position. Very good. -Go, go! 3, 4… My ferry is leaving. What about your boy? Can't you just watch him dance for a while? I have to go. It's leaving! I'm begging you, how can you just leave? Granny. My good boy… Where have you been? You're home so late. Look, I prepared a lot of food for you. Here are your favorite noodles and fried eggs. It's what you like, right? -Granny? But I want to eat taro today. Taro? Great! Why do you suddenly want to eat taro today? Granny is so happy. We have plenty at home. Hmm. Here you go. Granny, did you went to the mountains to pick longan fruits? Yes, I picked a lot of them, but they're not ripe yet. We'll wait till they're ripe, okay? What's going on? Are you upset? Missing your dad? Poor boy, let's not miss him. Granny is here. Let's not think about him anymore. Eat. Hmm. Grow up fast. You have to take care of Granny when you grow up. This is a story about Orchid Island. It's about the sea, about missing someone and waiting. It is inspired by Manawei and his grandma. It's called "Si-Masaka's Flying Fish". Children of Yayu are leaving to compete To tour the cities And perform their dance Children of Yayu will show off their brilliance Children of Yayu will glow in excellence So the world can see the dance of Orchid Island May you learn and grow, fear not the hardships. May you never forget Tao's proud culture. We shall celebrate and enjoy God is fair For He has blessed Orchid Island and every corner of the world Someone left these shoes around, so I brought them for Manawei. Thank you. They look quite nice! Thank you. Look at his old shoes. They're completely worn out. He always complains that he has no shoes to wear to school. It's fine that they're not new, as long as they fit. I feel sorry watching him wear those worn shoes to school. Good, they seem to fit well. See how happy he looks! Wonderful! He can wear them to Taiwan. They fit well. See how happy he is! Put them away, they're for when you go to Taiwan. Here. I wove it last night. I love you so dearly, my child. -Thank you. I wove this thong especially for you. Come, put it on. You know how? Come on, let me show you. Okay. Granny, look! Do I look good? Oh, yes! Very good. You look so handsome. Not bad at all. Pretty cool, you cheeky monkey. You're my No. 1 grandson. Come on! Very manly. You look like a warrior! Here, careful. Put it there. Careful. Any scissors? Hello? Is this Manawei's father? Hi, this is his teacher speaking.

No. It's also very hot here. Yeah, very hot. Super tall! Hello, Mr. Chou. Hi. Have you seen Weiwei? Where is he? Mommy! Weiwei… Weiwei. How come you're here! -Mommy missed you so much. Did you miss Mommy? Yes, I missed you so much! Really? How come you're here? Your teacher called me, he told me I must come see you! Are you nervous? Yes. -Yeah? Good luck! Mommy bought a lot of snacks for you. Share them with your friends, okay? -Manawei… And clothes. Manawei. Your dad came just now and asked me to give you these shoes. My dad? Yeah. But he's got a lot of work to do today, very busy, so he had to go. He left? Yeah. Manawei… Let's welcome the first team: Pingshan Primary School from Kaohsiung. It's a traditional Payuan dance called "People of Dagalawus". Let's give them a big hand! My Lord Jesus, we're about to perform on the stage. Please give us your blessing. Here's our prayer to you, in the name of Jesus, Amen. Amen. Okay everyone, let's go! Thank you, Pingshan Primary School! Next up is Yayo Primary School from Orchid Island. Their dance is called "Si-Masaka's Flying Fish." Let's give them a big hand! Masaka! Why don't you join the others? Ever since I was little, my father has never been around, when will he teach me how to build a tatala boat of my own? …Don't be upset He'll soon come back to our beautiful hometown. Let's row the boat together Raise the torches Surrounded by flying fish All is beautiful Let's row the boat together Raise the torches Surrounded by flying fish All is beautiful Let's row the boat together Raise the torches Surrounded by flying fish All is beautiful I regret for not Taking you out to sea Look at this beautiful big boat… Daddy! Why are you here by yourself? Didn't you promise my teacher you'd come to the dance? I didn't promise him anything, I said I'd go if I had the time. I kept waiting and waiting… You always lie to me! Daddy is working. I'm busy! Didn't I bring the shoes to you in the morning? I don't want shoes! I don't want any shoes! The shoes were expensive! What's wrong with you? Where on earth is your teacher? How can you come here alone? Hey, cabby, are you available? Yes, please get in the car. -Okay. Enough. I've got a customer. Go back to your teacher. Come on, back to your teacher! Sir, where are you going? Zhongzhengyi Road. -Okay. It'll cost $200. Daddy! Daddy, is Kaohsiung near the sea? Of course, Kaohsiung is near the sea. Not only is Kaohsuing near the sea, but also there's the Love River in Kaohsuing. Haven't you heard about it? When the lights come out in the evening, it becomes very beautiful. It's like swimming in a magical world. Excuse me… Manawei! Excuse me! Come, come up. Slowly. Come here. Careful. Here. Teacher. Let's sit here. Come. What happened to you, son? Let me take your blood pressure. I wanted to swim. You wanted to swim? I see… Are you feeling okay? He seems fine, but it's better that he gets checked out at the hospital, just to make sure everything’s okay. -Thank you. Why did you jump into the river? Why did you jump into the river? I just wanted to swim. Manawei. -Yeah? If you want to cry, you can cry. Don't hold your tears. Sir, I have no more tears to shed. All my tears have fallen into the Love River. Sir, there are so many roads in Taiwan. Not like Orchid Island, we only have one road. Hmm… I think it's better with just one road. Wow, very good! Thank you, Manawei. You picked so many longan fruits! It fell! Look carefully. Don't waste it. More here… Here, here. Why do I see the fruits you just ate here? Thank you, our vegetables! They're not vegetables, they're longans. Thank you, our longan! There are so many… You will learn to climb trees when you grow up. You shall go to the mountains often to check our fields. Manawei, you picked so many longan fruits! Too many! Well done. Thank you, my child. You're such a good boy. How long has it been Since I saw the sea in your eyes? How I miss that blue My voyage has gone beyond the map The sky wakes up above the sea The stars twinkle as reminders Is there still a harbor in your heart Where I can take shelter? Drink down a glass of tears As the waves sob onto the rocks The salty wind disperses the mist at night Dreams wander within the song Memories extend like hair The moon rises The oars break the night Such a big catch of flying fish All caught by my father How excited I feel! Wishing everyday is as beautiful as today How long has it been Since I saw the sea in your eyes?
