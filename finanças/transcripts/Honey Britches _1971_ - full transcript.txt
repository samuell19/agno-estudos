Because in that high I am the Judge of Hell. I seek the evil and wrong that men do. Not everyone is lucky enough to get my special attention. But if you do, I don't believe you'll live to enjoy it. Look. There are some people, men and women, with blood on their hands. They think that they are getting away with murder. But are they? Let's see if the Judge Death can help them on their way to Hell. In the predawn hours today when most people were still sound asleep, at least two men were very hard at work. The unidentified pair wearing stocking masks marched boldly into the midtown office of Dubois Jewelers, overpowered the night watchman, and made off with what has been estimated at over $1 million worth of rare gems. After discarding their masks, the thieves proceeded to the building's roof heliport, where they commandeered a helicopter. The helicopter was later found abandoned a small airport just north of the city. Witnesses at the scene say that the men were met by two females, and that all four took off in a twin engine aircraft that was apparently awaiting their arrival. This same plane is believed to have crashed in the heart of the Carolina mountains. The search for the wreckage is currently underway. One unconfirmed report states that two men and two women were seen stealing a jeep from a parking lot outside a roadside cafe just two miles from the site of the alleged crash. Join us again for the news on the hour, every hour, 24 hours a day. But now on with the music. Hey, what are we stopping for? It would appear as though we've run out of petrol. Oh man. You've gotta be kidding. My dear fellow, I can assure you that I have never been more serious in my entire life. Well, that's just great. So what do we do now? Why are you getting so upset? Let's just relax and wait for someone to come by. You stupid bitch! Why don't you pick on someone your own size for once, you creepy? Hey, have you ever considered minding your own business? No! Shut up, all of you. This constant bickering among ourselves is not going to get us anywhere. Well, can you believe that dumb broad? This whole area is lousy with cops looking for us, and she wants us to sit back and wait for someone to come along and pick us up. Well, at least she had a suggestion. Alls you've done is shout and slap your girlfriend around. But then you've never been noted for your great mental powers, have you? Suzanne, now listen to me, all of you. If you wish to tear at each other like animals, that's your affair. But I will not permit you to do it when my life and freedom are at stake. Now, I suggest we push this automobile over into the bushes and camouflage it. They're looking for a jeep, so if we can hide it, there'll be little chance that they can pinpoint our location. Well, that's just great. So we had the damn car. What good does that do us? Hey, man. In case you've forgotten, our contact man is in Miami. And how do you suggest we get there? Walk from here? Right now we're too hot to go anywhere. Even if we could get another car, there would be roadblocks up all over the place. Now, our only chance is to find someplace to hide around here and lie low for awhile. Oh marvelous. Yeah, that's a great idea. From the plane, you could see these mountains are full of shacks. Now, all we've got to do is find one and move in on the stupid hillbillies. Stop that racket, you stupid old fool. Are you trying to wake the dead? Nope, just trying to get your attention, Jezebel. I told you a hundred times. My name is Jessabelle, not Jezebel. And besides, it's Miss Jessabelle to you, Harlan Craven. Now hush all that noise and get in here. I'll be down as soon as I finish dressing. Harlot! Woman of evil! Forcing a man of God into your house of sin and shame just 'cause he has to earn a living. You shall be punished for your wanton ways, whore, scarlet woman! I was wondering if you were gonna stand out there all day a-tooting and a-shouting like a madman. If you move your ass as much as you move your mouth, you could have had my booze already unloaded and gone on your way by now. You've got the cash you wanted to pay with for these here bottles? Don't I always? You know how I got me that money, Harlan honey, huh? Wanna hear what I did for all the nice men to give me all that money, Harlan? Tramp! I'm shutting my ears, see? I can't hear none of them dirty words of yours. Evil money! That's what you got- dirty, evil money! Tell me something, Harlan. If you think I'm so evil, and my money is dirty, then why do you keep coming around to sell me this that you laughingly call whiskey? I should think that you'd be scared that God will see your truck parked outside a whorehouse and strike you dead, or impotent, or whatever the else you think he does. Evil Jezebel! Don't you even speak the name of our sweet father, you who pull men from their marriage beds to lust after the likes of you! Yeah. Well, I should that you'd be at home in your own marriage bed with that new, young bride of yours instead of standing around arguing with me. Or could it be that she ain't the right color? You're no different from all the other men around here, Harlan Craven. You all think you're doing me a favor by bending me down. Well, you just remember something. I'm the one who gets the money. Tell you what I'm gonna do for you, Harlan. I'll trade you even for the shine you brung. I'll trade you a piece of what I sell for some of what you sell. Whore! Daughter of the Devil! Get away from me, harlot! How dare you tempt a man of God! Oh shit, Harlan. Take your money and get outta here. I'm tired of hearing all your nonsense. Well, I certainly wanna thank you girls for all your help. We certainly couldn't have done it without you. Look, creep, I didn't come along on this fiasco to camouflage Jeeps, and I sure as hell didn't come along to enjoy your company. So get off my back. Well, Your Majesty, I can assure you that I didn't ask you to come with us. Yeah, well, I'd have never agreed to come with Phillip if I had known you were gonna be his partner. All right. I- I think we should get one thing clear right now. Obviously, things have not gone as I planned, but we have to make the best of this situation. We'll never get out of here if we're busy arguing all the time. We've got to be level-headed and work as a team. After we get out here, you can do all the fighting you want. But for now I suggest a truce. It might be most unwise to travel on roads, even small backwoods roads like this one. So I suggest we just start walking through the woods and see what we can find. And remember- no more fighting. May I be of some assistance? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. I'm Phillip Courtney. I'm afraid my friends and I have had a bit of trouble with our auto. We were hoping that perchance you would be able to help. Well, hello there. I'm Kirk Taylor, and this is Karen and Suzanne. Howdy. I'm Reba Sue Craven. Sure is nice meeting all you folks. You'll have to pardon me for staring, but whatcha been doing walking in the woods? Yes, well, that has to do with the problem I mentioned. You see, our car broke down, and we had to cut through the woods to try to locate help when we came upon your house. And just what's so damn funny about having to stumble around the black forests for over an hour? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't laughing at you. I was just laughing because I thought it was funny that anyone would cut through the woods instead of following the road. Y'all must have gotten turned ever which way if it took you that long to get here. The road ain't long what leads here. So your car couldn't be far from this house. Would it be possible for us to sit and rest a bit? Oh my. I don't know where my manners are. Ya'll come on in and sit a spell. There's a good girl. Could you please tell me where the john is? The what? The john. You know. Donnicker, head, water closet? Look, what my friend is trying to say is that she wants to know where the toilet is so she can take a bath. Well, if'n she wants to use the toilet, that's out back. But if'n she's wanting to take a bath, the tub's in the kitchen. This I've gotta see. Which way to the kitchen? How can you possibly expect me to take a bath in that? I do it all the time. Try to remember, Suzanne, not everyone is as big as you are. Maybe you could bathe half of your body at one time. I'll be glad to hold your feet in there while you bathe the top half. But if you did that, she would drown. Oh really? Well, there's a pond over in the clearing that I swim in sometime. How about that? Well, that would get the dirt off at least. Unfortunately, it's better than nothing. The bedroom's right in there. You can change your clothes in there if you like. It's all right. I can change right here. Go in the other room and change clothes. Either take your money swims or shut up. Do you live here alone, miss- or is it Mrs Craven? It's Mrs Craven. But why don't you call me Reba Sue? Everybody else does. Me and my husband live here. No one else lives here with you and your husband? Well, Tobe, he sort of lives here. Tobe? Is he your son? Mercy me, no. Harlan, he's my husband. Harlan and me's only been hitched up for four days, so we don't have no youngins yet. Tobe sort of works for Harlan, and he ain't got hisself no family. So Harlan, he lets him sleep down yonder in the shed. Hmm. When do you expect your husband to be home, Mrs Craven? Oh, mostly any time now. But I told you to call me Reba Sue. I reckon I just ain't used to my new name yet, and I sure would feel a heap more comfortable if you'd just call me by my first name. My god in heaven. You ain't aiming to parade around in them little nothings, are you? What's wrong with it? Not a thing, baby, not a thing. We'll see you, Harlan! Go on, boy. Reba Sue, why don't you show the girls where the pond is so they can be on their way? Sure will. Now, you just go 'round to the back of the house and follow the path what leads to the woods. It'll take you right to the water. Oh no. I don't wanna have to go back in those woods again! Come on, Karen. Would you fellers like a cup of coffee or something? Sounds good. Just what we need. K. Coffee may be just what you need, but that's what I need. You know, we may be in for some real trouble around here soon. What do you mean? I've done my share of time in jails here in the South. And I've been around these redneck bastards. I know what they're like and just how they think. So? So these hillbillies are big, strong, and dumb. They got muscles they ain't even used yet, especially in their heads. And from all indications, we're gonna be around a couple of em- her old man and the hired hand. May I suggest that we not worry about that yet? What assurance have we that these two won't be thin and frail? Oh come on, fella. Take another look at that broad. That's class A stuff in anybody's book. And class A stuff don't mate up with class Z. Well, perhaps you're right, but- Believe me! I know I'm right. Her old man's gonna be twice your size and as strong as an ox. Yahoo! Reba Sue! Girl, I found me something! Yahoo. Reba Sue, get your tail on out here and see what I done went and got for myself now. Come on, girl. Get your ass out here! Just who the hell they be? Come on, girl. I asked you a question. Well, this here's Phillip Courtney, and this is Kirk Taylor. They don't went and had some trouble with their car, and they come here for help. They been waiting for you to get home. Don't tell me no lies, woman! These fancy dudes come to see you. You reek of lust and sin! Harlan, now that just ain't so. I take you into my home. I gives you a name. And you repay me by consorting with a old devil right behind my back, indulging in the- in the wilds and the evils of the flesh? Why, you ain't no better than that dang Jezebel in town! How much did they pay you for your sin? Hand it over. Anything you has is rightful mine, 'cause I's your husband! Harlan. Where did you get that jeep? That's my business. I asked you where you got the jeep! I found it. Please forgive my rudeness, but you must tell me where you got that automobile. Well, me and Tobe was a-coming home and we passed this big clump of tree branches, now, I ain't never seen before. I mean, I've been living around these parts most of my life. And I goes up and down that road most every day, and I ain't never seen them branches. So I has old Tobe stop, and I gets me a looksie. And you know what? Underneath them branches was this nice jeep that somebody just throwed away! It didn't need nothing but gas, so we crumped it up and I brought it to home. Yes, yes. I see. Actually, the car is mine. That is to say, it belongs to me and my friends. We ran out of petrol and came here for help. We covered the car up so that no one would steal it. I didn't steal me no car. The good buck says, thou shalt not steal! So I didn't steal me no car. Ain't no law against taking something that somebody throwed away. So that car is mine! Now, now, now, now. I realize you didn't steal the car. It's all a misunderstanding. Suppose we go in the house and talk this over? Well, we can go in, but there ain't nothing to talk about. Liar, tramp! You speak with the serpent's tongue. Ye committed sins of the flesh with them devils right here in my own house! And even in my own bed. You whore! Oh, Harlan, don't be such a dang fool! Them things don't belong to me. They belong to the ladies what with these fellers. I don't see no ladies. That's 'cause they ain't here. They went swimming. That's what those clothes are doing in yonder. They changed their clothes in there, and they went over to the pond. I reckon you're right, Reba Sue. Them sure ain't yorn. Phil, what's the jeep doing outside? It would seem as though Mr Craven, Reba Sue's husband, found it where we threw it away. If you were gonna throw it away, why'd you spend all that time covering it up? Because he's neat and clean. He didn't have a plastic trash bag. Oh. Christ. So where is this Craven guy? You mean our friend Harlan? Well, at the present, he is standing in the doorway, marveling at the sight of your rather spectacular body. Harlan, that was indeed a most enjoyable meal Reba Sue prepared for us, Harlan. We can never thank you enough for all your hospitality. Bloody shame we'll have to be leaving so soon. Well, you all can't leave tonight. First of all, we ain't never decided the problem about who owns this here jeep. I mean, and besides that, you don't know this area. You might get lost or something. Nope, I reckon you just can't- you have to stay the night. But are you sure that- that you have room enough for all of us? Don't you worry none about that. We'll make room. I'll just go in there and tell Reba Sue to fix things up for you. What the hell was that all about? Since when do we ask these hillbillies if we can stay? We make the rules around here. My dear, dear, dear, dear Suzanne. You are indeed a most magnificent creature, but you have a total lack of patience. Try to understand that right now these good people don't know why we we're here or who we are. I don't know how long I can keep them from finding out the truth, but for now there's no reason for anyone to want to cause us trouble. Just in case, Kirk and I will take turns standing watch all night. But I don't really expect any problems. So what if he didn't ask us to spend the night? Surely you jest. I had all the cards stacked against him. First of all, he's been sneaking around all evening, drinking. And second, I had you by my side. I knew he'd want to keep you around here as long as possible. You know, I don't blame him. I like having you around too. It was really nice of Reba Sue and Harlan to let us sleep in their bed. I just can't believe they would give up their very own bed and insist that perfect strangers use it. My god, Karen. They just let us use their bedroom. They didn't present us with the crown jewels. Do you always have to make such a big deal out of everything? Can't you two just go to sleep? Must you chatter all night? Now, I just came in to tell you that Kirk and I are sleeping on beds Reba Sue made up for us in the living room, and she and Harlan are on a pallet on the kitchen floor. Kirk will be outside standing guard first, and I'll relieve him later so that if you hear anyone moving around, it'll be us. Now, I want you two to shut up and go to sleep. As soon as they think we're all tucked in, the sooner they'll go to bed. As drunk as that old fool is, I can't understand why he's still awake now. Good evening, Brothers and sisters. This is Brother Love again, coming into your homes with the ministry of the air over this fine radio station. Now, folks, if you remember last week, we spoke on the evils of alcohol. And during the course of this week, I've heard from you folks by cards and letters, many of you staying you wanna know more about this devil's brew. And I can't tell you how many people just come up to me on the street and shook my hand and said, Brother Love, said isn't it OK to take that little social drink with their friends at the cocktail party? Or another one said, Brother Love, isn't it OK to sit out in the backyard after and drink a nice cold beer? Well, friends, I'm gonna tell you like it is. These mealy mouth, no good, everyday Christians say it's good! Listen to me. Liquor and alcohol has its place. And folks, that place is in Hell! Drink none of- Bullshit. Harlan. Harlan. Harlan B Craven, you good for nothing son of a bitch, wake up. Cover yourself, woman. Ain't decent to walk around like the day you was born. Harlan, I'm your wife. Doesn't that mean anything? Daughter of Eve, woman of evil, over your shame. I'm a man of the Lord, and you dare parade for me like that? The good book tells us in 2nd Corinthians that we shall not be found naked. Oh god. It's gonna be one of your Bible-spouting days. Man of the Lord? Hah. That's a laugh. I might have known that this would happen with all that corn liquor you been guzzling down all night. Anytime you start guzzling, you start spouting. I surely think you must drink more of that stuff than you sell. Tell me something as a man of God. How do you explain the fact that you've been staring in that depressive drink all night. A dirty mind spews forth filthy thoughts. Harlan, please look at me. What's wrong with me? We've done been married for four days, and you don't have nothing to do with me. What's wrong with me? Cover yourself, Jezebel. Damn you, Harlan. Love of money is the root of all evil. The lust that comes with wealth is the lust of death. Reba Sue, it's Cold this morning. It's real nippy. You know, I don't see how them girls went swimming down in that pond yesterday in that cold water. And they was half naked. Wonder what the weatherman says. NEWSCASTER (ON Police say they have no clue to the whereabouts of the jewel thieves. The report that a jeep was stolen from in front of the Star truck stop by two men and two women yesterday has been confirmed. However, the jeep has not been located. Fingerprints found on the crashed airplane have been sent to Washington for identification. On the local scene, Billie Jo Whitaker says she plans to try out for the blue ribbon in the cake bakeoff at the fair again this year. You know, Billie Jo- I'll bet them thieves are them folks in yonder. If'n they are, we can't let on we know anything. I do believe it might be just a bit late for secrets. What you gonna do to me? Now, don't get all excited, Harlan. We're not going to hurt you unless you force us to. We're going to stay here a while. That's all. If you and your lovely wife behave, no one will be harmed. Uh, Reba Sue my dear, if you would be so kind as to prepare us all some breakfast? It would be most greatly appreciated. Now, as I see it, our first move is to change the way we look. In these clothes we stick out like a sore thumb. Reba Sue, can you find us some clothes like you people wear that will fit us? Well, I reckon I might. I have a box full of old clothes I collected for the church mission box. I don't know that it'll fit, but I guess you could try. I sure hate to use 'em though. 'Cause that's meant for the needy folks in the mountain. I can guarantee you that we'll return them when we leave. We can try them on later. One of my people will be with you at all times. We'll all be a lot happier here if you cooperate and do not cause trouble. We'll do anything you say, mister, anything. Hey, where is everybody? Well, let's see. Good old Harlan, Phillip, Karen, and that other creep are out in that old shed. Harlan had to check on his still, and Phillip is keeping an eye on him. And you know that dingaling girlfriend of yours. She had to tag along because she's never seen a still before. I've never seen one either. And if never do, it'll be too soon. You know, creep, those clothes are very becoming on you. You look just like the rest of those stupid hillbillies. You know, bitch, one of these days I'm gonna tear you apart. Why wait? Any time you think you're big enough, you just try it. You're too anxious. I bet you're just perverted enough you'd enjoy being kicked around. Well, maybe later, baby. By the way, where's Reba Sue? Isn't someone supposed to be keeping an eye on her? She isn't going anywhere. Karen fell so much in love with those rags that Reba Sue gave her to wear that she turned around and gave country girl all her good clothes. Reba Sue's in the bedroom right now, trying everything on. Be a good little girl and go outside and play now. I got business with the lady of the house, Oh? What kind of business? Private! Now get out. Hey, baby. That's gonna look a hell of a lot better on you than it ever did on Karen. Whatchu doing in here? Can't you get out of here till I get my clothes on? Why, baby? You'd only I have to take 'em back off again! Leave me be. What are you talking about? Us, baby, us! We're what this is all about. You're crazy. What's wrong with you? You're plumb crazy! I'm a-warning you. You'd better be for getting outta here 'fore my husband comes in. He's crazy mad jealous of me, and he's gonna tear you apart if'n he comes and finds you in the bedroom with me. Yeah? I was outside watching last night when you tried to get that old man to screw you. I saw everything. I saw you standing there, begging that dirty old man for what I'm gonna give you. And you don't even have to ask me! Please don't. Please. Please don't. I'll scream if you don't get away from me! So go ahead and scream. Who do you think old Harlan's gonna believe anyway after what I heard last night? Huh? You or me? Especially when I tell him you begged me to do it to you. Please don't. Please. Kirk old pal, you've had it now. Little Suzanne's gonna get her sweet revenge. I say unto you that he that looketh upon a woman with lust in his heart hath sinned already. Suzanne, did you know that Harlan has his very own still and makes his very own whiskey? I never in my whole entire life met anyone before with their very own distillery. Have you ever? Karen dear, we can talk about that later. I'm one of your best friends, wouldn't you say? Well, I- sure, Suzanne. I guess so. Well, best friends help each other out, don't they? I guess so. If you knew that Phillip was cheating on me, you'd tell me about it, wouldn't you? Oh yes, Suzanne. But honestly, I don't think he is. Oh for god's sake, Karen. I'm trying to tell you that your precious Kirk is in the house right now, screwing that Reba Sue dame. Oh! You bastard! You dirty rat bastard, I've caught you! What's the matter? You bitch. I'll teach you you can't steal my man. Hands off! Filthy bitch! Hands off. Filthy bitch. Filthy bitch. Good god. She's dead. I think you can understand why I have to say this, Harlan. First of all, Karen was a good friend of ours and your wife killed her. That was unkind. However, if word should leak out that we are here, we would have to tell the local sheriff how you, and your wife, and Tobe beat her and killed her while holding the rest of us captive. I can always say that you were trying to find where we hid the jewels. You do understand that I would be most distressed to have to tell such a story, but I feel that I have no choice. Well, yeah. I reckon I can understand that. And you, Tobe? Do you understand that if anyone should find out that we're here, you would spend the rest of your life locked in a cell behind bars? That is if they don't fry you in the electric chair? Yes, sir. I think I understand that right enough. Good, good, good. Now that we have that little matter settled, you fellows continue burying Karen while I go in the house and finish a few matters in there. Now, you listen to me and listen good, you rotten little bitch. You think I'm stupid? I figured out all by myself what happened here with Karen, and as far as I'm concerned, you killed her. Phil, how can you say such a thing? Well, for openers, in all the time you'd known Karen, you never once went out of your way to talk to her until today. Should I bother to go on? No. Actually, her death is a lucky break for us. I can use it as an axe to hold over these people's heads and keep them in line. But so help me, you try something like that again, and I will have two axes. You do understand, don't you, my dear? Yes. Hey, baby. Why the long face? You look like your best friend just died. Come on, baby. Don't act like I'm the village leper. You know, this whole thing isn't exactly all my fault. 'Cause I know you enjoyed that bedroom scene as much as I did. So you can just quit acting so above it all. Or is this silent treatment your way of trying to tell me you're ready for another little romp in the hay? Don't you ever try anything like that again. You know, don't you, that after we leave here your life is gonna be like a living hell? Things are gonna be a lot worse than they were before. That's for sure. Until we got here, all you had to cope with was a drunk husband whose only interest was in other women and pretending he's God. Things have changed now, baby. And I've got a feeling you're gonna have to repent for everything you did, every day you're around that crazy old man, especially with Karen's grave right out back to remind him of your sins. We're gonna be leaving here before long, and I'm willing to take you with me if you play your cards right. You ever been to Miami, Mexico, or France? No, I ain't never been anywhere but here. Hell, there's no future for you around here. I saw the way you were looking at those things of Karen's. Well, hell, I'll buy you dozens of dresses much prettier than hers! And I'll give you a place to wear 'em too. Now, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Well, sure. But I don't think Harlan'd let me wear 'em. Forget Harlan, goddamn it! What are you? Simple or something? You go with me, and you'll never have to think of Harlan again. I can't understand how a sexy looking broad like you ever married that old fart anyway. I had to marry him. Had to? You've got to be kidding. You had to marry him? That's right. My pa owed him some money, and he made him a deal with Harlan. Harlan, he just needs him someone to cook, clean, do all these chores around here, and he got me. How much money did your father owe him anyway? Almost $200. Ha! $200? Why, I spend more than that on food every week. So for less than $200, which old Harlan knew he probably wouldn't collect anyway, he sure got himself one hell of a sexy looking workhorse. He had to marry me up proper like. My father seen to that. He ain't gonna have his girl living in sin. Wow. Let's hear three cheers for good old daddy. Wouldn't you like to be living in nice hotels, and wearing fancy clothes, and having other people wait on you for a change? Well, sure, I reckon. Let me show you something. Take a look at these, Reba Sue. You know what those are? I don't rightly reckon I do. They look little pieces of broke glass, don't they? I don't suppose you get so excited over some glass. Glass? Reba Sue, these are diamonds- diamonds. What you see here is worth over $1 million. My, that sure is a heap of money. A heap of money? For a girl who was sold by her father for less than $200, I'd call that the understatement of the year. Don't get so upset. It ain't that I don't believe you or anything like that. Its just that, well, I find it powerful hard to believe that you can get more than $20 cash money for all this broke glass. Look, Reba Sue. You see this necklace of Karen's? It's really pretty. Don't you think so? Now, if I told you this was worth a lot of money, you would believe me, wouldn't you? These stones you see here will someday be put into settings. Then people will wanna pay a lot of money for them. So we take these, and we sell 'em to a friend of ours. And he in turn sells them to a jeweler or somebody like. And they make them real beautiful and put 'em in settings. Now do you see why these are worth all that money? They sure do look like little hunks of glass though, don't they? Look, just forget about the stones. Take my word for it. The man in Miami is gonna give us a hell of a lot of money for what you see in this case. After we get the money, we're gonna split for Mexico and hide out for a while. Then on to France. Now, all the plans have been worked out. And they're plans for four people. Obviously, Karen won't be going with us. What do you say? You wanna go with us? You wanna escape from this place? Gosh, I don't know. Kirk? Yeah? I want to talk to you. In a minute. I want to talk to you. Now get your ass out here. OK. OK. You think about it. Then be smart, and get out of here. He who lives by the sword shall perish by the sword. OK, I'm here. Are you happy now? I'm beginning to think that I have not been happy since I first took you in on this job. But that's more or less beside the point now. Suzanne tells me that you have some harebrained scheme about taking over the old man's moonshine business. Yeah. Listen, man. This could be great. There's money to be made from moonshine. You know- you know, Kirk, when I first considered taking you in on the jewelry heist I- I had some second thoughts. Because I was afraid that you might be too small time for me. I think you have just confirmed those feelings. You know, I'm getting sick of you and that trap of yours always trying to put me down! I am not thinking small. There's money to be made from moonshine, especially in these hills. Come now, old boy. Look. Don't know "old boy" me. I'm getting sick of you and your little putdowns. I've got a name, and I'd appreciate you using it. I'm not trying to put you down old- pardon me, Kirk. It's just that I find it hard to believe that you're talking seriously about going into the moonshine business. Look. You yourself said we may have to hole up here for weeks. Look. It could even stretch into months. And these small time cops have got nothing better to do than keep up an active search for us until something else big comes along. And there's no telling how long that could be. So? Look. Harlan Craven is the man around here as far as moonshine is concerned. And if he doesn't keep his business up, people are gonna soon start checking on him. And I'm sure you don't want that, do you? No, I can't say that I do. Then I think you'll agree with me that he has to go about his business as you well. But we can't really trust him to do it alone. And that means one of us has got to go along with him. And I don't see any sense in doing all that and not getting any of the profits. Look, Kirk. I'm not arguing with your logic. I realize that we may be here a lot longer than I thought at first. And I can also see that we'd probably all go crazy just sitting around here all that time with nothing to do. But I just can't get all worked up about selling moonshine. It isn't exactly my idea of how to get rich quick. Yeah. If there's so much money in it, Why do these people live like this? Because they choose to live this way. To them, there's nothing wrong with this way of life. Besides, you have to understand how their minds work. It takes one to know one. It's actually good business for him to live like this. If he started making his rounds in a Cadillac, his customers would be offended and soon stop buying from him. Why, I'd be willing to bet he's got a bundle of money stashed around here somewhere. Hmm. You may be right about that part at least. And I would be willing to bet that his wife doesn't know anything about it either. OK, Kirk. I'll go along with your idea. You start making his rounds with him. Reba Sue and Tobe can stay here. He can pass you off as a new helper, a distant relative, or something. And then, my dear Suzanne, I want you to do what you do best. Oh? What's that? I want you to make a big play for Harlan. Give it all you've got. It shouldn't be too hard. He already looks at you like a lovesick puppy. Show him how great it would be living with you and all your fringe benefits. And get him to open up about where he keeps the money. You've got to be kidding. You're crazy if you think I'm even gonna get near that dirty old man let alone let him touch me. Just think about it, my dear. I think you'll realize that in the interest of your future health and well being, it would be to your advantage to play along. In other words, Susie baby, he's gonna kick the living the shit out of you if you don't screw that old man out of his money. I don't believe I need your help in interpreting my orders. I believe that Suzanne and I can find a solution to our problem. Damn you, Harlan! Damn you. Damn you. Double damn, Harlan Craven! Look at what you went and did! What's the matter with you boy? You ain't gonna have another one of them fits of yours, are you? Damn you, Harlan! Get a look at what you went and did! What you talking about, boy? You know what I'm talking about, you old goat! I done went and filled up every one of these bottles with shine, and you come along and guzzled down half of it! Now, Tobe, let me explain something to you, boy. Now, we's like one of them big city corporations, you see? And I'm in charge, and you is- well, you is the one I is in charge of. You see? You do all the mixing, and the brewing, and the pouring. And I does the tasting. You see, we don't wanna sell no shine what ain't been tasted, do we? Oh. I guess you're right, Harlan. I'm plumb sorry I hollered at you like that. But I guess I just didn't understand how things are. That's all right, Tobe boy. Now, you just get busy and fill up these bottles. We don't sell no half empty bottles, not Harlan B Craven. 'Cause he's a man you can trust. You right, Harlan. I'll get on that right away. All right, boy. Well, I'm glad to see you boys are hard at work. Got some good news for you, Craven. Phillip and I have talked it over, and we've decided to go into the liquor business with you. What do you mean? We're all gonna be business partners. That's what. Phillip and I are gonna cut ourselves in for a little share of the profits. Well, what if I don't like that? Then I'd say that you're SOL. What's that mean? Shit outta luck, fella! We've taken a vote, and the majority says we take over. Well, what if I don't go along with all that? Then in that case, I guess we'll have one less partner in our little business. Well, you gonna have to eliminate me. I ain't about to let you take money that belongs to me. Ain't nobody gonna steal what I work for. Oh, you have no idea how much I'd like to pull this trigger. Nothing would give me more pleasure than to blow the top of your head off and just see if it's as empty as I think it is. Ain't nobody gonna get my money. I ain't gonna let no city slicker come, and take over my house, and start ordering me around. Oh, I think with the help of my little friend here we can convince you to cooperate with us. Hey, look at that! Don't pull that old crap on me, pops. Is that a real gun? Why, hell yes. What do you think it is? An ice cream cone? Never seen one like that before. Can I see it a minute? - Now be careful. - That's nice. Hey, Tobe! The wages of sin is death. Come on, boy. Let's get out of here before them over ones can get to us. Going someplace? Harlan, you know that gas we took from the truck and put in the jeep yesterday? Yup. Well, I don't think we should have. Good. Automatic. Go, Harlan! Harlan, help me! Help me. My leg! Oh god, somebody help me! Harlan! Help me. Oh my leg. Oh god. I'm sorry, boy. You understand. I gotta go on now. I'm sorry. Harlan, help me! Help me, Mr Courtney. Please, please, help me. Certainly, old boy. I- I'll help you. Thank you. Thank you. Glad to have been of service, mate. Ugh. Now, Lord, you've gotta help me out of this here mess. You owe me! I been- I been witnessing for you for 20 years. Well, maybe I slipped up a few times, but hellfire. Everybody makes mistakes! You're probably saying that I got myself done into this mess, and I can just get myself out. Well, don't be high and mighty with me. I mean, you put the little hole in the ground I hurt myself in. So it seems to me that it's your responsibility to get me fixed up and get me out of here. I'll tell you what, Lord. I'll- I'll make you a deal. Whatcha say? Maybe I ain't been too careful about my witnessing, but if you get me out of this, from now on- from now on I'll only sell my shine to the good Christian folks around here. I won't- I won't sell no more to that Jezebel woman so she can serve it to them men in that whorehouse of hers. How's that? Whatcha say? We got us a deal? Come on, Lord. Help me. Thank you, Lord. Harlan, I've been so scared. I heard all those shots, and I saw that girl out yonder in the yard. I was scared to go outside. Thank god you're alive. Get off me, woman. Can't you see I can hardly stand up, and all you wanna do is hang all over me. It was awful, Reba Sue, just awful. That Courtney fella was after old Tobe and me. And that dumb old Tobe went and got his leg caught in one of them bear traps I set out last year. You remember when I set them things out? I shoulda caught me something besides old Tobe. I recalls last year- Harlan, what about Tobe? Huh? Uh, old- old Tobe? Yeah. Well, if you quit bothering me, I'll tell you. Well, there was old Tobe with his foot in the trap. And I stopped and tried to pull him loose. And then this Courtney fella catches up with us. And I try to fight him off, but he- he got the best of me, and he knocked me out. Well, then he up and shot poor old Tobe. Just shot him dead. When I seen my chance, I slipped away. And I set my trap for him, and I laid low waiting. When I heard him coming, I jumped him. He tried to fight back, but I got the best of him. And when I had my chance, I done him in. Harlan, you coulda been killed. I guess so. Where'd this come from? Oh, this? It's been in this case of glass them folks brung in. Glass? This ain't glass. These are them jewels that they stole up there in New York City. Reba Sue, you remember that Red Wilcox what moved up to Charlotte? He was a friend of your Pa's. Red? Sure, I remember him. He tried to marry up with me. My pa just told him to keep away. He's just a good for nothing bum. Well, your pa near was too smart. But to tell you the truth, old Red done pretty good for himself up there in Charlotte. And I- I hear tell he's right well off. You know something else I heared about him? I've been told that he's a man to go to if'n you need help, if'n you know what I mean. Yup, yup. I'll take these jewels on up to old Red. I'll get him to take 'em off my hands. Bet I'll be getting a pretty penny for 'em too- a pretty penny. And I'll buy dozens of dresses. Hell, I'll give you a place to wear 'em too. Now, you'd like that wouldn't you? You ever been to Miami, Mexico, France? The way I see it, I got no choice. I can get through them roadblocks by myself. By myself. Dig out all the money I got hid under the closet floor. And I'll take these jewels, and I'll skedaddle all up there to see old Red. And with all the money I have I can go somewhere and make me a new start. By myself. Ain't no way I can explain to the sheriff what happened around here. Yes. By myself. I'm gonna be rich- rich! By myself. What more could a body want? Well, I see things turned out as planned. The evil were punished, and the good rewarded. I like a happy ending, don't you?
