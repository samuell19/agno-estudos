We're taking a look right now at Kenny Sims Jr. He's headed to the ring. This young man has an opportunity tonight to make his way into the finals, so he's going to be looking to really go into the ring - and take charge and... - Just, uh, going over some instructions from his father. Kenny Sims Jr. is about to win this fight. You know, this is a fight that he really needs to win. Ringside, and Kenny Sims Jr. from the South Side... South Side of Chicago... Kenneth Sims in the corner. Kenneth Sims Jr. And there you see the win, Kenny has his hands right up... His hand's held up. He won the fight. Team Sims is what it's called right now... This kid is up and coming. A toughened street kid from Chicago's South Side. Say hello to perhaps the finest 12-year-old boxer in America. There he is, Destyne Butler Jr. Destyne Butler Jr. is 13, and a champion Junior Golden Gloves boxer. He trains in the South Side with coach Frank Smith and the Gladiators Boxing Club. He's only 12 years old. You may want to remember the name Destyne Butler. Harry Porterfield says Destyne Butler Jr. is someone you should know. My hopes and goals is hopefully being at the Olympics at 17. He wins and then becomes a professional fighter. The 13-year-old has been boxing since the age of six, and he already holds seven title belts. His goal... What is it about this sport that you love so much? Cause, it's like, you can hit people and you can't get in trouble for it. Destyne Butler Jr. Remember the name. They started boxing. Destyne was already boxing when Kenny came along. Destyne was the man. Destyne was there in the Nationals, and so was Kenny. Kenny was slick, Destyne was slick. Both of them, they were already at the top of their game. He hasn't had it easy. With this particular neighborhood, you were subject to see at least once to twice a month, gun shooting. You were subject to see crackheads. Dope fiends. Every day. We've struggled, there's been times where we didn't have heat, we didn't have lights, we didn't have gas. Sometimes we ain't have food. But your best fighters come from hardship backgrounds. ...that other foot has to come over. Look down at my feet. Look at Coach's feet. When I step over, I take my right foot first. Boom, right? I know you can't do drugs if you're with me. I know you can't get in trouble if you're with me. This is what you doin'. See? So let's try it again. We gonna... That's why, I keep him up under me. Look, I hit you with one, two, right? Why you goin', "I don't know"? What coach tell you? You scared of anybody? Go start working on one, two, the one, two three. - In the mirror? - Yes, sir. Let me see. In the male's life, usually, he's either gonna look up to his father or he's gonna look down on his father. If he has a father that has done his job, he's gonna look up to him. If he has a father who hasn't, he's gonna look down on him. Now he's gonna look for a role model somewhere else. And that's how it works. As a coach, I want to bring the mean side out of him. As a father, I want to see him smile. It's been times where I've padded him and padded him and padded him, and he was ready to quit, and I made him keep going. Take a step back there... try it again. I've made him run... till he throwed up sometimes. And I know if I can't break him, nobody else will break him. Our goal is to make the Olympic team. Mayweather's speed. It's been a question of whether the skills can match up. Nails the first, straight, right-hand down the pipe by Floyd Mayweather. How would you fight Zab right now? Come over and jab as he rain-danced. And bring it back low. All right, tell me what you do-- what would you do with Floyd? Combination so he can't counter. Where? His chest. Sometimes I'm sick of talking about boxing, 'cause I can't get away from nothing. I'm always like, at home, it's with me, at the gym, it's with me and stuff. Feels like I'm at the gym even when I'm at home. I used to hate it. He made me do it. Now, he told me I could stop once I got good. But once I got good, I didn't wanna stop. He had natural talent. He just made some bad decisions, which sometimes you can't get out of. I was mad, hurt, upset 'cause you didn't have to do that. I made all the sacrifices for this family, and you want to do some dumb stuff like that? I'd give you my last. Oh, he cut his hair. You cut your hair, man? - Huh? - Yeah. That's a jailhouse cut. That's a jailhouse cut for real there. You been working out? Nah, you ain't been working out. What about sit-ups? Nah, that ain't automatic. Yeah, Dimitri, he want to be like his big brother, man. He wanna be like you, man. I ain't never doin' that. He wanna hang with the-- Shit, well you put, you sure did do a good example. Hmm? He want, he want the fame. He want the fame. Just like you want it. The fame and the glory. All right. Can you see my mama? She's not on. All right, she fixin' to step right here for a second. Right there. Hey! How you doin'? You doin' good? Yeah, make a muscle so I can see you've been working out. Let me see. Whoo! Destyne, I think it's bigger than yours. That ain't bigger than mine. So how you been doing? Yeah. We miss you tremendously. You know that, don't you? Yeah. Good, good. I feel like I let him down 'cause, like, I know, I know he expect, I know he expect more from me. I know he never thought I was gonna be in jail. I never thought I was gonna be in jail. So, that's, that's the main thing. And, you know, he probably, I know he thought I was gonna be somewhere farther in my boxing career by now. What happened was, um, he went to high school, and he wasn't dedicating himself to boxing. I guess he needed a break, so I say, I'm not going to be one of those dads that say, "No, you've gotta do this," when you don't really wanna do it. Now, I feel like I should've done that. 'Cause I asked him one time, I said, "Man, where'd you get some money from?" Said, "Man, what you doin'?" He's like, "I ain't doing nothing just get ou-- " I said, "Man, what you doing? You selling drugs?" No, I ain't selling no drugs. I got this money from gambling. I said, Okay. I said, All right, man. I said, It's on you. That's just all I said. Hey, this is Destyne. I'm downstairs again. Sure. They've charged him with three burglaries out of Cook County. Then we're staring down one, two, three, four, five burglaries out of Lake County. Residential burglary is what we call in Illinois a Class 1 Felony. Class 1 Felony, you are not eligible for probation. It's a minimum of four years in prison, a maximum of 15 years in prison. But the kicker is, is you are eligible for something called Bootcamp. It's called the Impact Incarceration Program. It's a six-month program. It's in the Department of Corrections. You go to a camp, it has a military-like... training, good mentors. It's a really good program. It's actually, I've found it to be very, very successful for a lot of my guys. He could be out of Bootcamp by September, back training, back with your foot to his throat, - Oh, yeah. - to keep him out of trouble, and I don't see why he couldn't, you know, be ready for the Olympic trials, and make the United States Olympiad. Right. My dad got incarcerated. Once he was locked up, I was missing a father. He was gone, and, I really don't... because honestly, when I was 16, 17, I was working. You know, I was working, working. I had a Burger King job, and then I started working at the Marriott hotel. I was making pretty good money, I don't know, 'cause I worked. I believe in making some money. But, uh, I don't know what happened or something, I think the job was over with, and then and then some of my, some associates that I knew, or whatever, went down to this neighborhood, and I seen what they was doing, they were selling the drugs. And I'm like, man, these guys making money. And I'm like, why I can't make the money? You know, I sold cocaine. And then after the cocaine, I went into the heroin trade. A bad day was maybe $5,000, $6,000. A good day... might've been nine or ten. An FBI investigation, a DEA investigation. They got one of my best friends, and he told me that they asked about me. And I'm like, you know what? I'm gone. 2103, right, Mike? That money not worth it. 'Cause you can't buy freedom. Can't buy freedom. I've done a lot of stupid stuff. I tell my son all the time, You could pick up my traits, but you can't be shit like me. That's how I tell it to him. I ended up street fighting a lot. Those who know me will tell ya, I probably had maybe 200 street fights. For real. I stayed into fights. I didn't end up boxing like I should have. ♪ Banner ♪ ♪ Yet wave ♪ ♪ O'er the land ♪ ♪ Of the free ♪ ♪ And the home ♪ ♪ Of the ♪ ♪ Brave ♪ Weighing 165 pounds, middleweight bout in the winners' bracket.

It was no longer time to be the coach, it was time to be a father and protect him. Well, first of all, we're very proud of you. We think you did outstanding. You-- you represented Chicago well, you represented the neighborhood, your family, all of us, so we're proud of you, man. We can either go with the Olympics one more time, '21, where it's going to be in Brazil. We don't mind. Your uncles don't mind going to Brazil, let me tell you that. So, we got all kinds of fallback plans. That's awesome. So the tournaments next year... He lost bad. We sit down, his mother, my best friend, and my godbrother, and we'll sit down and talk. And then if he feels as though he wants to continue, then, he has our support. We still learning how to win. They-- they've been there, and should already know how to win. We still learning how to win. So, that's stuff we can correct And our time will come. I was living, like, a double life or something. When I was out in the public eye, you know, I was this, I was this good, I was this good kid, you know? I was boxing, I was playing basketball, you know, I was getting the girls all this, nice smile, all that. But then, behind, behind the scenes, I was doing what I was doing. I was doing the other side of me. ...especially, they never had crimes like that before. They, they treatin' this like a murder. They treat it like it's a triple murder or something. Oh, we finally caught him, you know? Brian, the ring leader, the grown man? The ring leader right? He went in all the stores, right, to pawn shit and whatever? So when, you know, you pawn a Mac, man, you got the serial. I mean, whoever got a Mac got their serial number. You know what I'm saying, just like iPhone. Get my iPhone, police, get stolen? I take my shit to the, to the, to the, to the, uh, police station and he stole this, I got my serial number. Soon as that shit hit the pawn shop, the pawn shop write serial numbers down too. So they saying that he was there. But, it was, um... robbery, home, I mean armed robbery? Look, look, look. Brian said that Destyne was, um, like in the car while he was out there. He ain't never get out, but he was in the car. - Right. - He was like, man, is everything okay, everything all right? And then Destyne's like, "Yeah, everything okay." I don't think that's recorded, but this is what the dude's sayin' on the statement. Like Destyne was the lookout. Right, basically the lookout. Well, we're in here, we gotta do what we gotta do, ya know? Brian was, he worked for the high school that Destyne was going to. He worked there, you know, like, in the administration department or something like that. He did something. And also, he... was working for a not-for-profit organization which they mentor kids. And this guy was a mentor to kids. You know what I mean, helping the kids get college scholarships and all this stuff. But at the same time, he was manipulating the kids, and telling them, "Hey, you know, I can show you how to make some money. All you gotta do is sit in the car or this and that." And the kid is like, "Yeah, uh, oh, okay." I mean, he, he was a cool dude, at least I thought. But... I guess he just, well, I ain't gonna blame it on him 'cause it was my fault too 'cause I did it. But, he just put the wrong thing in my mind. We always got up in the morning, so, we got up early. We went, and... uh, we went in the house, and the lady was there, but we didn't know. So we went in the house, and we grabbed what we grabbed or whatever, and the lady, she came, she came chasing after us. We just left out, we hurried up and left out. Look at your back feet, Dee. You see? That's your problem. Where your back feet supposed to be? On that side! I asked you a question, why you running with your left hook? Destyne. Well, he's gonna try to get you bootcamp, man. You ain't getting no probation, buddy. You can forget that. That ain't gonna happen. I'm gonna keep it 100 with you, you're not getting no probation, man. Man, you gettin' into big boy shit. This is big boy shit. You didn't have to get into no big boy shit. What the fuck I've been doing all my life? Been doing big boy shit, man. You didn't have to do none of that. So you, as a young man, you gotta suffer the fucking consequences. 'Cause all I'm fucking telling you: go to school, graduate, get your ass in the gym, box. That's your fucking natural God-given talent. Ain't no motherfuckers offering you no scholarship. Now you wanna get in the fucking gym. That's crazy. But now you gotta battle this shit. I ain't, I'm not saying you can't make it, you can't do shit, 'cause Nate, Nate been in the motherfucking joint, and when he got out of the joint, he made it to the fucking Olympics. Doc Nicholson did the same thing. I've done spent five thousand, five thousand, Destyne. And still gotta spend more. That's all right. For what? What do you have to show for it? Like me. When I was out here selling fucking drugs, when I used to sell dope, I, I had shit to show for it. I had y'all a fucking house, I had money, I had cars. What the fuck you got to show for it? A closet? That you-- that you got a closet. Some fucking TRUEs, some fucking bullshit, gym shoes, all that shit. You can't get no money for that. You got four robberies in Lake County, just sitting in a motherfucking car, man? How many times have I told you in life, you two dudes is in the car, and this dude shoot a motherfucker. What I tell you always? You might as well grab the gun and shoot the motherfucker yourself, 'cause you did it too. How could you not listen to me? I've done been through the fucking, I've done been rich, I've been broke, I've been poor, I've been through it all. Kidnapped, shot at, gangbanged. I done did all that type of shit. How can you not listen to the-- I'm the perfect motherfucking role model! I didn't make the Olympic team. I cried like a big baby. Since then, they had the National PAL in October. I won that. I won the USA Nationals. I just felt like I wanted to do something... bigger... go to the next level. A couple people contacted me, they flew me in, talked to me and stuff. 'Cause they'd seen me, as an amateur. They'd seen I was good, so they were tryin' to convince me to turn pro sometimes. Just to get me down and listen to 'em, give me some ideas and stuff. It's not about me, it's about people that matter to me, like my dad, my mom. ...clocks out California. My first time here, and I already can tell you my favorite venue for boxing. An amazing crowd, an amazing atmosphere, and amazing... Where we live... I want my own bedroom. It's a one-bedroom apartment for three of us. How we pay bills, that's what I want to change. I want us to move. A local professional boxer was shot to death in the Chatham neighborhood of the city's South Side. It happened Thursday morning. A man known by some as a neighborhood angel, who was just seen raking leaves outside his apartment, Walker was gunned down, according to police, in his gangway behind his home... Brothers and sisters, please hear me because I don't have nothing prepared. I'm speaking from the heart. It may look like because we ridin' around in nice rides that things are going well. But things aren't going well. Millions of people are in prison. Brothers in prison sayin', Man, how is it going outside? I tell them, How many transfer buses do you see coming in? If they still coming in by busloads, then no, ain't nothin' changed out here. Senseless murder. Senseless killing. It's when we live a life to where we don't have to worry about bullets flying. When we live a life where we don't have to worry about whether they're closing the penitentiaries because nobody's doing anything to go. That's when changes are made. Wake up, get out of bed. Count time. Hurry up! Hurry up! Get your sheets and your blanket off your mattress. Let's go, hurry it up. Keep moving. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Foot lockers, let's go. Louis! - Louis! - Yes, sir! Blame his brain and heartbeat. That's all he has goin' on. Yes, sir. Inmate Carter. N46390, sir. Inmate Heal. N42902, sir. Inmate Ruskella. N44359, sir. Inmate Butler. N44730, sir. What's your first name? Inmate, sir. - Say it again. - Inmate, sir. - Say it again. - Inmate, sir. - Say it again. - Inmate, sir. - Who are we? - IIP, sir. The Illinois taxpayer, the American taxpayer, is laying all their hopes and dreams on every tax dollar, and it is my responsibility to train you, and train you I will. - Do you understand that? - Yes, sir. If you want to graduate this program in 120 days, you better reach down inside you, every freakin' morning, and decide that you're going to do this for yourself and your family. Do you understand me? Yes, sir. - Ooh-rah! Ooh-rah! - Ooh-rah! Ooh-rah! - Ooh-rah! Ooh-rah! Their motto is "As fast as you can." Don't slow drag, don't be all lazy. So, they just want you to stay busy. If you stayin' busy, like, when I was staying busy, I wasn't getting into trouble. Once I stopped staying busy, that's when the trouble started. So, I mean, it's basically just to stay busy. And, I, I can't do nothin' but respect that 'cause I see, I see it a whole different way than probably other people will see it. 'Cause I know what stayin' busy can get you. If you stayin' busy, you can't do nothin' but keep moving. Keep moving forward. But once you stop, that's when you start getting into trouble. Next six times, deep flutter kicks. Sir, yes, sir. Left, left, right, right, left. Left, left, right, right, left, left, left, right, right, left. Down to the right. Left. March. Left, left, left, right. Left, left, left, right, right, left, left. Right, left, right, right. Hello, everyone! How's everybody doing, man? How you guys doin'? Good, good. You ready for the next transition? Everyone, it is now officially a business. I talked to Gary Shaw, um, yesterday. I, you know, the best thing that they said, really, was what a nice young man you were. And how you and your dad, they left you out, Mom. I know, I always get left out, but that's okay. But they said how you and your dad, you know, worked together and came up through the ranks together, and just been very honorable and nice. So they were just incredible. They probably don't know his mom. Well, his mom, Mom is the anchor. Look, look they'd probably know me if I'm out in there shoutin' and hollerin'. Yeah, the mom is the anchor, so that makes sense. The contract is five years, and if he becomes world champion during that time, it's extended automatically for another two years. They're just like announcing who I'm signing with and stuff. They announcing what? Who I'm signing with and stuff, and, like... You're announcing who you're signing with? - Yeah. - Oh. You're fixin' to go pro or something? - Yeah. - Yeah? What day? Uhh... the first fight is March 7th, I think. - March what? - Seven. March 7th? - Man! Y'all hear this? - What's that? He's having his first pro fight. Let them know, Kenny! We could take the shop down there and support! - It's uh, March 7th. - Chicago's own! ...welcomes you to New York's JFK International airport. What happened to the hair, man? You cut it? You better go work for George Steinbrenner of the Yankees. He realized that you were ready. That's why I love shoes. Seriously, he loves shoes. You wanna hand it to him? Hope this is one of many checks that I have to deliver to you. - Many. - Okay? It's good to have you on our team. It's good for you to be part of our family. Thank you. That's it. You guys are now officially pros.

You, even being and coming up out of Englewood... where they think nothing good can happen, is a blessing. Amen. It's not just you, bruh, it's, you are us. You gotta do it 'cause you represent us. Not just your mother and your father. You represent us. I want you to know whether you win or whether you lose, it's just the fact that you made it. It's a blessing, bruh. You know, I used to beat Kenny. I was the poster child. I was the one that everybody was looking up to. I was supposed to be the one to be the next Floyd Mayweather. All right. When I get in the ring, and then we touch gloves and stuff, I look him right in the eye. And if he look away, then I know I got 'em. But, if he just lookin' straight into my eye, I know I got a war. Now, answer back. That's it. Downstairs. Double it up. Inside. Yeah, I'm makin' something good out of my fighting on the streets. From living in the projects. Right, knock it down, right back with that right. Pah! Pah! I'm making, then, a positive way instead of a negative way. That's it! That's what I'm talking about. My dream is to go to the 2016 Olympics. And just go out there and win. Honestly, I think that I'm still one of the best boxers. In the future I'm-a be a champion. Good evening, Sonny Means here with a premiere boxer that's going to be on the scene pretty soon. And, the young man is Kenneth, Kenneth Sims and his dad. Number one, let's take this first of all from the top. Now, when you were in school, and you were going around and looking at what's happening in Chicago with a lot of young kids, were you bothered by it? I know your dad said you were picked on a lot and he wanted you to really get yourself prepared-- - Wait, wait, wait. - Okay. I wasn't picked on. - You were not picked on? - No. Okay, well, that's, I heard something, not necessarily from your dad... Nah, he just said I was small, he didn't want anybody to pick on me, but I ain't ever, I ain't... I ain't worried about it. Talk to me about the neighborhood that you live in and the plight that you see around. A lot of folks are talking about the fact that Chicago and its ghetto areas, are murder central for the most part. Does it bother you, and then you look on the street and you see a lot of people, young guys your age and younger, are getting in trouble, using drugs, and gangbanging and what have you. You ever have anybody come to you and try to drag you into that situation? Nah. I don't put myself in those situations to have to deal with that. I'm either at the gym, at home. I hang out with friends, but when we hang out it's in the house, so I'm never anywhere to put myself in that situation, to have to deal with things like that. That's a good attitude to have. Thank you, Kenny. All right. See them reflexes? It's God-given talent. Two on that side, two on that side. Pick it up and put it in. Come on, man. They young. We just moved to a bigger apartment. It's like two times bigger, that's it. I got my own room now. Different neighborhood. In Chicago, though. Left, right, left, right, left, right, left. Up in the morning for the rising sun! Up in the morning for the rising sun! We'll run all day till the run is done! We'll run all day till the run is done! We eat our breakfast too soon! We eat our breakfast too soon! Be hungry as heck just before noon! Be hungry as heck just before noon! Man, my life can't get any stranger! Man, my life can't get any stranger! Makin' my living as a district range ranger. Makin' my living as a district range ranger. I was doing all right in bootcamp, but after they found out that I was a boxer, I was supposed to be in the 2016 Olympics, that's when they really started to write me up. Ow, my foot locked and I cut my finger! You can hear me, but I can't hear you! You can hear me, but I can't hear you! We still got a lot of PT to do! On your mark, get set. They put me through the hardest that that bootcamp got to offer. But there's this thing called motivation. When you work out nonstop from 5:30 to 3:30. They were just trying to get me to say I quit. They felt like I had something to achieve, so they knew what to take away from me. Line up in front of your foot lockers, go. Yes, sir. I was thirsty to go home. I'm thinking, like, I got this far, they ain't fixin' to terminate me now. Put everything away. Yes, sir. But, man, that was their whole plan. Gettin' my hopes up. Butler, you have to live every day of this program like you - mean it. You understand? - Yes, sir. You have to sound off every day like you mean it. - Yes, sir. - You have to convince me you have desire to successfully complete this program, and that you're worth me and all the rest of these staff investing our freakin' interest and our hard effort into, that you're worth it 'cause you're going to give us the end result we want. - Yes, sir. - Do you understand me? - Yes, sir. - Then sound off then! - Yes, sir! - Louder! - Yes, sir! - Louder! - Yes, sir! - Like you freakin' mean it! Yes, sir! And that's when they kicked me out. When I was that close. Ten days left. So, I don't know how much you've heard, or what you know, but they have definitely thrown him out of bootcamp program, okay? And, I think it's, um... it's got me kind of mind-boggled as to why they did it. So, he started the program, he was doing pretty good. - Right. - There were no issues, he says he was doing fine. I talked to him on the phone. And then, he became the champ. "What's up Ali?" They started saying things like that, and, um, from that point on it appears they did everything they could for him to fail. So, he has, like, another 18 months, which... I know for someone who is training, these are his prime years. Because what, he's 19 now? So... Yup, so he'll be 21, I mean, he's missing... he still has opportunities, he still could, but you know, you know... you've been around boxing your whole life, - you understand. - Yeah, yeah, right, right. He, he's not a bad kid. He's never been in trouble before. I mean, one, one bad month and we're gonna destroy this guy? Makes no sense to me. You know, ever since talking-- calling him Hollywood 'cause he was a boxer and all that, so they was messing with him, and they had... somebody had put a letter in, in like his personal space, put it in his shoe or something. And the letter was for somebody in the girls' bootcamp next door. And, uh, and they kicked him out for that. And they had witnesses to say that it wasn't him, he didn't write that, and that wasn't his handwriting. They know his handwriting. And they said, nah, we've been wanting to get rid of your ass anyway. And so they put him out. Kicked him out. Hey, sweetheart. What a clusterfuck here. Well, my main event fighter is stuck at the border in Mexico. How you feelin'? Are you nervous? Nah, nah, not at all. All right, you wanna be announced as, uh, Kenneth Sims Jr.? - Yes, sir. - Out of Chicago? Or you could put Bossman in there, but that's cool. - Bossman? - Yeah. - Kenneth "Bossman" Sims? - Yeah. - What's he gonna eat now? - Lobster. Lobster. Lobster? Seafood? Lobster tonight, really? All right, all right. Here with Kenneth Sims Jr. You're making your pro debut on ESPN Friday Night's card.

Happy Father's Day. How you and the family been doin'? I've been, I've been all right. Just trying to work out every day and keep my mind focused. And just tryin', just tryin' to stay to myself. I always wanted to tell you that you're my role model because you were the real epitome of a man. You did everything that you said you was gonna do. Like when you said you was gonna get us out of the hood and move us to the suburbs, you did that. And that's every man's dream. That's every drug dealer's goal. I don't want y'all to think that me coming to jail was y'all's fault because y'all did an excellent job at raising me. But when I got older, it just seemed like I drifted off into the, into the badder things. Because I feel like that was my biggest downfall in life, and I regret that. I love y'all. So write back soon as you can. If you can. Hey, guys, good evening. I just went over the rules with your opponents so they have a pretty good understanding of what should happen tonight and what shouldn't happen tonight. You guys have an obligation to the promoter and the fans. Yeah! Yeah! Kenneth Sims Jr. Bossman! Bow our heads. Father God, we come before you saying thank you, thank you for all that you have done for us, thank you for all that you are going to do for us. Lord God, we ask you... Kenneth "Bossman" Sims Jr.! Kenneth "Bossman" Sims Jr.! Right, left. Madison Square Garden, ladies and gentlemen, big night of fights, we got a nice six-rounder here. Two young charges, and this is the first meeting between Kenneth "Bossman" Sims and Luis Rodriguez. Playing out of Chicago in the blue corner, Kenneth "The Bossman" Sims Jr.! Big moment for both young fighters. It's also their first time appearing here at the mecca, Madison Square Garden. Sims comes into this fight undefeated at 5-0. Rodriguez, 3-2. Sims answers. Big right hand. Rodriguez is lunging. Pete Santiago breaks them up. Very exciting fight for both young fighters, first time fighting at the Garden. Work the stick up. Work it. Sims is trained by his father, Kenneth Sims, Sr. Work the stick up, work it down! And he wants that jab. Here we go! Sixth and final round. Sims with the nice combination. Clearly landing the cleaner punches. Here we go, ten seconds left. And there he lands a big left hand. The crowd loves it. And he finishes strong, and I see Sims staying undefeated in this. And there you have it. Kenneth Sims Jr. stays undefeated, 60-54 2x and 59-55 on one of the cards. They gave Rodriguez... 59-55, Kenneth Sims. Man, you know that's coming off! Say what? Man, that's coming off. Where my clothes at, man? What you mean where your clothes at? What you got right there? Huh? - Where my clothes at? - My fucking boy. You got a coat? Who is that down there? Huh? Who is that? That's the police. Who is these young savages you got with you? I don't know neither one of them. What's up, man? What's going on, man? - My man. - What's up, little bro? Yeah, man, I'm Gucci, man. What's up, man? Boy, you need to... Boy, that's what they got you in? Yeah, man. What's up? Nothing much. How you feeling, man? Y'all looking good out here. I got to take this off right now. Look. No, these somebody else's, dog. Hold on that, that's the police right there, right? Yeah, we good. We off their property. Mm-hmm. You straight, my boy? Yes, sir. I know you ready. Yeah, I'm ready. Oh, you ain't that tall, boy. Man, please, man, you little, man. You little, man. You little, man. You ain't, no, you can't be no 165, boy. Yes, I am. Well, you gonna have to drop that then. You little. You ain't that big. We fixin' to go to the gym right now! So what you got a taste for? You know, I know, like, when I was in jail, I was like I need to eat me some pizza. What you got a taste for? Some steak. I said that too. That's what I said, too, I'm like he's gonna want some steak. And, uh, some shrimp. Some French toast, whipped cream and strawberries. What's up, man? What's up, man? What's up? What's up, man? Look who's here! What's up with y'all, man? Man, same old, same old. Working, man. So, it didn't work. Hey, it's a tradition. You have to box when you come home. That's the tradition. Come on. Go to him, go to him, go to him. Here he come. Give me something, champ. Two five, two five, two five, two five. You gotta grab the hands down. Two five! I just felt like I wasn't the same boxer. My timing was off. My speed wasn't there. My foot movement wasn't there. I just felt awkward. Dig, dig! Dig deep! Let's go dig deep! Let's go! Let's go, dig! Good work, good work. Good work. Get up, get up. Come on. Good work, man. You gave it all that you could, man. It's all right. I'm scared to get back up. Here, get some water. Hey. You did good. It ain't nothing to be mad at yourself about. You been in jail four years, son. Four years. It's okay. J, tell him, man. Four years! Four years. Okay, you all right. You gonna get back. In four years. Come on, man. You did exceptionally well, man. You already knew, we already knew, man. You was gonna get tired. It's okay. It's just hard work, you gonna get back there. Get the fuck outta here! I just randomly woke up at like 4:30 in the morning. And I had, like, four or five text messages. People telling me. They told me how bad it was. Another homicide over the weekend took the life of one of Chicago's best boxers, 25-year-old Ed Brown and a female relative were shot early Saturday morning near his home in West Garfield Park. Brown was shot in the head and his relative was shot in the leg. His managers say they were heading home after working out at a nearby gym when someone pulled up next to them in a car and opened fire. We've been together since I was eight or nine. I wouldn't call him my friend. I call him my big brother. His coach, George, used to tell him to go over our house to keep him out of trouble. He called my mom his mom. He called my dad his dad. Me and him talked about being world champions, winning titles together, since we was small. Now I got to do it for the both of us 'cause he can't do it himself now. And make him proud. To do what we talked about. All right, ladies and gentlemen in Atlantic City, New Jersey! We are just about two minutes away from going live on the Showtime Network. Standby. ...and still undefeated: Kenneth "Bossman" Sims Jr.! I messed it up. I hit the button, and I couldn't get back on for some reason. What happened when you started relaxing? Which was the eighth round. You hit 'em with the C. And bad boy's smiling. He's smiling down. - He's looking down on you. - Yeah. You're tired. That's okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, baby. Come on. You ain't gonna let his spirit die, and the gym not gonna let his spirit die. We not gonna let his spirit die. He was right there in that ring with you. He's supposed to be here! Destyne Butler Jr. is making a name for himself inside the boxing ring. The 13-year-old has been boxing since the age of six and is already a Junior Golden Gloves Champion... I gotta be real with myself. I have been off six years. He's working his way to the Olympics, and the young hopeful says that he has big plans for the future. The moment of truth for me is winning. 'Cause when I win the Golden Gloves then I'll finally feel like, all right, I accomplished what I wanted to accomplish. ...he'll be the right age to compete. That's when I'll finally feel like I'm back. All I know is, the great, funny, laughable, happy person, Ed Brown. People die. I've been to a coup-- like, funerals, but... that's not the way it should be. But when you're accustomed to living around here... I pretty much got all my cryin' stuff out. Stuff can happen to everybody, but... that's why everything happens for a reason. I've gotta get my timing back right. I gotta get back in boxing shape. Reclaim my spot. Same thing. Again. Two-three. Two-three. One. One. One-two. One. I can't really say what's gonna happen with Destyne. You know, I'm just being honest. Because you don't know where his skill set is. When you take as much time off as he has, and your body goes through what we call growth changes, where when you were little, combinations came out... and you got-- 'cause you had short arms. As you getting older, your arms getting longer, your body's getting longer, your feet are getting bigger. Your skill set is not the same, and what happens is, if you haven't been continuing training your skill set during the time of growth, you don't know how much you're gonna pick up. See, it's a little different if you're the type of boxer that, you gonna brawl anyway, but Destyne was never a brawler. He had skill sets. He wasn't a banger. He had skill sets. What's one of the things that go on boxers first? Their skill set. What doesn't go? Their power. He wasn't a power puncher. He was a skill set boxer, and with that being said, I don't know. Hopefully he gets it all back, but I don't know. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the final night of Chicago's 2018 Golden Gloves. This is the world's largest and oldest amateur boxing tournament.
