Mm, you know you're the baddest thing I done seen in this club, right? What's your name? Candy. Mm, Candy, okay. So, that means I haven't tipped enough to get the real name. Oh, honey. No. Okay, all right, all right. Well, how much is VIP? 250 a half hour. Well, I just got paid, so. Mm, let's go. Uh-uh. Oh, okay. So I haven't paid enough to touch yet. No. All right well, why don't we just talk? Talk, okay, okay. We can do that. I mean, you know the clock is still ticking though. I know, I get it, I get it. This might help. Yeah, thank you. So what's your name? Todd. Mm-hm. What's your name? Your real name this time. Glenda. Nice to meet you, Glenda. Mm. Damn, your body is crazy. Well, thank you. You know, I do work out four times a week so it better be. And you know, these nightly workouts. Right, right, I get it, I get it. This place could definitely be a workout. So, I'm trying to figure something out. What makes a girl like you get into this life? I'm just curious. You sure do ask a lot of questions. Well, I am a paying customer. Except the clock is still ticking, so, a brother can't ask a few questions? Oh, take a wild guess. But see that's obvious, that's the obvious answer. I get it, money. See, I'm thinking deeper than that. I think. No, no, let me figure this out. Heart break? Oh God, man I'm supposed to be the therapist, not you okay. I'm not a therapist but I am a mechanic. So that means I like to get under the hood and see what makes things tick. So you like to get under the hood, you say. Mm-hm. I mean, is it on the table? Or I didn't pay enough yet? Well, take a wild guess. Mm. So, am I right? Is it heart break? Well, uh, one heart break wouldn't have me here. Let's try many. You know if you were with me, I don't think you woulda had that problem. Oh, that's a new one. Like I haven't heard that 20 times a day. Maybe 21 is the charm. Well, all we have is the here and now, right? Mm-hm. So let's enjoy it. I can do that. Mm? Yeah. And you never know. You might get to see what's under the hood one day. Shit, I hope so. 'Cause I would love to get to know you outside the club. Yeah, maybe. Oh, heaven. Hey. Hey. Okay. Mm-hm. Ah. Mm-hm. Happy? I'm happy. Okay, now remind me again why we're doing this 'cause it was very last minute. Oh, because it's important to me, babe. Remember, it's important. It's important to you? Yes. Okay, well that thing that's important to you will be here soon, so you go get dressed. I got this. Then, well. I got this. It's all done. No, almost. I still have to take the chicken out of the oven. I could take it out and put it in the warmer but potatoes need, they need a half hour more. Babe, I got this. I'm a doctor. Go get dressed, this is not surgery. Go on. Okay. Go get dressed. Oh, I'm gonna take a hot shower. I'll only be in the hot shower about, another half hour. Really? A shower? Yeah, a shower. Mm kay. A hot shower. Oh, see now you playing. Oh, and then maybe I can put on that little red dress that you like so much. Mm-hm, hurry back. Hey, don't touch the dessert, okay? It's for the guests. Hurry back. Can't promise about that ass, though. Babe, why are you drinking? And you took the medication. Um, it's a special occasion. We're celebrating something that's important to you, right? Yeah. Yeah, can't I have a cheat day? Oh you been cheating all month. Because I'm invincible. Babe, please. Okay, fine, after tonight I'll eat whatever you cook. No questions. I love you, silly. 'Cause you're perfect. Am I? You like this? I don't know, you think we should wear the hair up tonight? I mean, you're so pretty. You got that good hair, you know. Can't even believe you're your nappy headed momma's child sometimes. Is that them? Yeah. I think that's them. What, what, I gotta answer the door. Baby! - I'm coming. - Come on! I'm coming, I'm coming. Gotta ahead of me. God, you're so beautiful. I'm Brian. Nice to meet you man, Todd, Todd Allen. This must be the husband. Oh yeah, the love of my life. Yes, my lovely wife has forgot her manners. Excuse me sweetie. Brian. I'm Glenda, the long lost best friend. Yeah. To the rescue. The husband. Right. Oo. - Oh. - Yes. Here, I brought this. I can put this on ice. Yes, girl, let's. Okay, come on. - We're gonna go this way. - Okay. We'll talk to you guys. Remember, we gotta drink. This bottle. All right, so you know what? What? Your husband, he's cute. Yeah, and you brought Todd? Okay, so that was last minute. I actually didn't think he'd say yes. Mm, well I think it's okay. I mean, I didn't clear it with Brian but he seems fine with it. I don't think he's upset. You know, actually, he seems like an asshole. Who isn't an asshole to you? Girl is that a rhetorical question? Like, I actually cannot believe what I'm seeing right now. What? - Girl what? - Yeah. What do you mean what? All of this, this, what I'm seeing, you. Like, I don't even know the bitch I'm looking at right now. You don't even look the same. Okay, stop. You're sounding weird. But girl, is this even real? Like blink two times if you're in trouble. It's a nice place you got here, man. Yeah, it's modest. We call it home. Thank you. You're welcome. Ah, don't tell the wife about this. She's been on me about my drinking lately. Nah, you good bro. I ain't no snitch. Yeah, thank you man. I like you. You like me? Yeah, I know your type, I like you. Man, no offense but we just met. You don't know anything about me. Why are you so beautiful? You're saying that like you're not. Oh god, girl, you're like, I don't know, paid Instagram, sponsorship model beautiful and I'm just some disgusting grab ass motherfucker beautiful. Okay, there is a difference. No, there's no difference. Beauty is beauty. No, you're exotic beauty got you living up in the hills and my black beauty got my light bill paid a time or two. All right, I'm so way past this thinking. Stop it. Think about what that thinking got you. I didn't create the rules. Are you past that too? Because it looks like you aren't past benefiting from it. What are you talking about? See, that's the thing. They want us to fight and put us against each other. If we do this then we're no better than they are. Easy to say when you're considered better. You're the one just saying that. Girl, are you serious right now? I have eyes. Look around, look at this place. So, I'm supposed to feel guilty because I made good choices in life. And what, I should? Well, it's starting to sound that way. Look at us. It's all because somebody hyper sexualized our images and we're made to feel responsible for it. I refuse to. What? See, it's that. It's that right there. What? I know you, bitch. I know that this isn't you. This Vanna White, Betty Crocker bullshit that you're doing right now. I know how you get down. Girl, those aren't even your teeth. What? Girl, let's be real, it's me. Be real with me, you don't have to be fake. Oh, so now I'm fake because I decided to get braces? No, you're fake because you didn't invite me to the wedding, or the house warming, or the college graduation, and then all of a sudden you just call me. You know, I'm a really good judge of character. If you say so. I say so. Okay fine, I'll bite. What's my type? I'll be honest with you, all right? My wife, Glenda, hardly talks about her past before me. I didn't know who the fuck Glenda was up until a week ago. You know, and then when she said she wanted one of her work friends to come over, man, I couldn't believe it. Where you going with all this? Relax, I'm just, you know. I'm gonna lay something on you. I'm qualifying what I'm gonna lay on you, right? Mm-hm. So you don't think I'm some kind of magician or something. Okay, all right. So, we established that. Right, I don't know nothing about you. You don't know nothing about us. Now, go ahead and tell me, what's my type? Okay, what are you? You a 27, 28? I'm 28, yeah. And what's Glenda she's 33? Am I right? Yeah. You're a survivor. You both are. But you're tired of women your age and the games they play and are attracted to a more seasoned type woman, like Glenda. Right, she doesn't smother you. She allows you to be a man and you like that. You need that. Glenda, she's an upgrade for you. But you'll never admit it but you'll prove it with your pitbull type loyalty. This here, my house, is a first for you. But you're too cool to get excited and admit that. You know what, you work with your hands, right? Whatever you do, you're good at it. Damn good, actually. And you been through a lot of shit but you're never gonna go through it again. Especially not with a good girl like Glenda by your side. And you know all that just by looking at me? Uh, yeah, all that and more. Just by looking at ya. - Is that right? - Yeah. All of a sudden you wanna call me because you're putting some fish in the oven and want some company. Um, I. You know, your rich ass probably didn't even season that fucking fish. Did you? Girl, I made chicken tonight, okay. Look, okay you know what I got the hot sauce. 'Cause I know Brian did not marry you for your cooking. I eloped. Wait, what? Brian didn't want a big wedding because he was already married before so he didn't want to make a big deal about it. Wow. Oh, and that chicken recipe I got off the internet. Girl, I just wanted you here, okay. All of this talking back and forth, I just wanted to see my girl. Okay, you know I'm here. And I've never asked you anything about it, right. When you called I came. I'll always be here for you. Always. I actually thought I'd never hear from you again, you know. About that night. Oh, I refuse to talk about that night and litigate it. That's back in the past. I don't focus on it now, okay. Okay, all right. So on a scale of one to 10. Okay, 10 being the highest. How black can my ass be tonight because your uppity ass mighta changed but I have not. I'm thinking on it. Mm-hm. You're being so silly, bitch. Let me pour you a drink. Ugh, we good! Your suit, it's nice. Exactly, exactly, exactly. It's nice, but guess what? It's not tailored. And I bet you Glenda made you wear it but you left the tie out because you're just not ready to conform, right? You like that new style billionaire. Those Jay-Z types. Those woke billionaires with one foot in the street and the other foot in the gluttony of luxury. How am I doing? - Can I be honest? - Yeah. You full of shit. You full of shit, that's what I think. You know what, that's why I like you. Cheers, man. What you guys talking about? Oh just. Yeah, okay. Okay, guys we gotta check on our dog because the neighbor's dog sitting and you know it's like a miscommunication. You know, something simple. Is there someplace we can talk? Patio. Is the dog okay? You know, it's fine. We'll be right back. Be right back, yeah. Do you believe that thing about the dog? Or is he just in the dog house? I don't know. I guess, I hope the dog's okay. Oh yes. What's up? Okay, change of plans. Something is not right. Oh, if you're trying to get outta here right now you ain't gotta convince me. This dude is fucking crazy. Okay, look, not yet, all right. I just need to get down to the bottom of it. I need to get him alone or something. You know what I mean, just, I need a moment. Did you turn into a detective or some shit behind my back? Nah, I'm just saying, like, you ain't seen this girl in about what, three years? So all of a sudden the second you show up, she gotta be saved. Look babe, can you just trust me on this? All right, she's definitely hiding something and I know he's hiding something too. What does that even mean? Okay, look, nothing, all right. Can you just follow my lead and help me transition the conversation so I can get a moment with him. All right, I mean whatever you need but you're gonna have to tell me why. Okay, it's just my instincts. If this was your homeboy, what would you do? Look. Okay, we need to get back in there. Okay, but you told me. We agreed if we had a bad feeling about this thing we could just go, that's what you said. So are you sure you still wanna go through with this? Baby I have to. That's my girl. I gotta make sure she's okay. Can we just go get my purse, please? Mm. What's gotten into you? This is already your second bottle. Oh, I know. I'm gonna have to cut you off. You know what, I promise I'll slow down after this evening. I just, I don't know. I think I'm getting a little cabin fever. I've been cooped up in the house too long. Oh, is that why allowed me to have all my friends over because you're so bored? I don't know, maybe. Not only that but I'm proud of you. Heh. I am, because when you have fun, everyone does. You know what babe, that sounds a little self serving. Maybe but. Mm-hm? Okay, look hold this. All right. Babe. Whatever you need. You got a lot of hair back here. - Hold this for me, okay? - All right. Yeah, okay. What's up, y'all? Mm, hey! That's my joint, girl. You already know what's up. No. Yeah, come on y'all, stop playing. No, I'm good. Just like riding a bike. Come on, come on girl. You know what's up. Okay, I think we've had enough. Oh come on. Girl, come on. Come on. You know we need to talk. You, come with me. What, what was that? Girl, a blast from the past. Acting like you didn't like it. I just didn't need it. Okay, but you looked like you were having fun to me. Having fun with you was never the hard part. Mm-hm. Well, you know what, what am I doing here? I just, I need you. I need you to move forward. And I need that part of my life to die. Mm, you can't kill the past, girl. It's a part of you. No, not for me, not anymore. Then what am I doing here? I need you. I just wanna move forward. I mean, what else can I say? Mm. Wait, wait, stop. I can't do that. Okay, wha, well you do know this is your husband's idea, right? He sent me emails that were from. Come on. So, your husband sent me an email and he said it came from you. Yeah, I forgot. He was supposed to send you the address. Oh, okay. Is that it? Well yeah, you aren't mad, right? No, I'm not mad. I'm not mad at all. Oh, okay. Um. What, is there something else I need to know? All right, all right, all right. Okay, so here's the truth. I remember him from the club and you know the moment I came in I recognized his face. He used to come in all the time. Oh, I already know that. Okay, did you know he was there before you started, like, all the time? Men go to strip clubs. Okay, all right. I just didn't want it to be weird. Weird, it's not weird. No, correction, can it get any weirder? Well, no, but you know. I just wanted to be honest with you. Okay, was there something else I should know? No. Girl, we're good. I'm just glad you're here. We're good, all right? Actually I gotta pee, so. I think this liquor, oh. Bathroom's right. - Where? - Here, girl. Okay, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. You know Glenda, she's big into the art stuff, man. Like especially that thing you got in there. Where would I get something like that? Like that there? Yeah, exactly like that. No offense, Todd, but that conversation is just a little bit above your tax bracket. Yeah, it definitely is but what can I say, she's interested. So maybe you could talk to her, or. Come on, Todd. She put you up to this? I don't get it, what? We're two grown ass men married to strippers and you want me to talk to your girlfriend about art. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see where you're coming from. Yeah, you're a little late, bro. She already laid down the marker. All right look, I'm gonna be real with you. She said she needed to talk to you about something. You know her from somewhere? Maybe the club, some shit like that? Do you normally remember strippers you meet at clubs? Not necessarily. Exactly. You know what. They think that thing between their legs is power but it's not, Todd. No offense, it's not power, money is. And I'm not mesmerized by that shit. I'm not. Noted. Just because a woman catches my attention doesn't mean she warrants space in my brain. So you gonna talk to Glennie or not? Nothing rattles you. Absolutely nothing rattles you, does it? Not about this conversation it doesn't. I knew I liked you, boy. I knew I liked you. I'm glad, man. Just trying to be me. Gentlemen, dinner's ready. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. This must be organic fruit, girl. Oh my God. Babe, you ain't had no chicken. Look at this chicken. This chicken look like Ralph's. And you know you love that Ralph's chicken. I need to get you some chicken. Well, chill. I say we should toast. No, no. Babe, that's not necessary. Yes, of course it is! Hold on. I know I give you a lot of shit about this magazine ad. But I'm proud of you. Yay, my girl's boosting sales and shit. I am so proud of you. 'Cause when I got you this job, I never thought it would turn out this well. What? Latavia didn't tell you? I didn't. You didn't tell 'em? No. Okay. Tell 'em the story, baby. Okay, okay, okay, okay. So, Brian has this friend and this friend happened to be a photographer. And he gave him my picture without my permission, I might add. And this friend, he's photographer, and one thing led to another and that's why we're here. She's being modest. She's the face of Jet Talent Agency. Not only is she gonna be on the cover of this magazine but her face is gonna be on bus ads and internet ads. What? What photo? I mean, it's gotta be an amazing photo, right? If it caught a photographer's eye. My life's blushing. I wanna see the photo. Nah, it's just a stupid picture. It can't be stupid, I mean we're all here for it to celebrate you. I wanna see the photo. Um, it's not the kind of photo you pass around at a dinner table if you catch what I'm throwing. Okay, babe we talked about it, we laughed about it, now it's over. I'm not laughing. I mean, baby, are you laughing? I'm good, I'm chilling. No, I wouldn't laugh. Let me see the photo. It was a nude picture. I showed him a nude picture. But its not what you think. You don't know what I think. I know I don't, but it was just a picture of my work. - Okay, your work? - Yeah. Yes, he's a plastic surgeon. Oh, now that explains so much. I appreciate it but I can talk for myself. Latavia is my masterpiece. I fixed that nose. I lifted that butt and those breasts. I am the best plastic surgeon in this region and you may not know me, but you know my work. If I was unethical I could tell you stories. Okay, so showing nudes of your wife is ethical? She was a stripper. You still are. I showed a potential client my portfolio. I do not see the big deal. It got her the gig. That was the point of the story. I'm a mechanic. Are you serious right now? What, nah, you know what I'm saying? 'Cause it's like, we know that they dancers, okay and we know that he's a surgeon so I just want everybody to know what I do for a living. We shake asses, he shapes them. Your job does not compare, baby. That's a tough cough you got there, man. You all right? Its okay, I have a heart problem. My doctors say I should take it easy. I'm sorry to hear that. No, it's all right. And before you judge me, I've always had a heart problem. I got this. Should you be drinking like that, though? No, I don't wanna get in your business or nothing like that, man. But I'm just saying. My grand daddy died from heart shit, so, hope you taking that shit serious. If I listened to what my doctors told me, I would have died of boredom by now. They don't want me to smoke. They don't want me to drink. Boring sex positions, tasteless foods. And my best friend is my cardiologist. He can revive me from anything. I'm like the black Dick Cheney. Aw, babe you know I don't like it when you say that. I'm joking, no, seriously I'm just kidding. I got this. I'm good. My doctor gave me a clean bill of health and I'm okay. Cool. Yes. - Babe? - Hm? Another bottle. Oh. Chop-chop! Imma come, imma come with you. Babe, I'll be right back. Come on. I love that girl. Ever since I told her about my heart condition she went from slutty Amber Rose to boring. And the things we used to do. It was like head in the bathroom, threesomes, whatever I named she would do it. Now, nothing. I don't know. Tell me, what phase are you guys in? Phase? Yeah, phase, you know sex phase. Honey moon phase where you can't keep your hands off each other? Discovery phase, where you guys just try to figure out what each other likes or autopilot phase where you just going through the motions? I don't know, I never really thought about it as a lot of phases. You have no idea, my brother. All right well look, I'm gonna be real with you. I have no interest in talking about my sex life with you. I really don't wanna hear about yours, so, I ain't doing this. Really? Mm-hm. We are both fucking strippers. If we can't brag about that then you know what, take my nuts now. I'm gonna get some wine. You know you shouldn't let him talk to you like that, right? Don't you think I know that? Well look, I'm sorry to hear about you and Latavia. Well you know what, we're phasing out. Mm, sorry to hear that. Yeah, you know. That's what prenups are for, man. That's why God created prenups. If we get a divorce all she's getting is the house. That's it. I don't get you, man. 'Cause your wife is beautiful and if she does all the things for you that you say she does, why would you mess with that? Fuck, I just want this one night to go as planned. Cool, you know it's early, so, it's fine. November 19th. What's November 19th? That's when she turns 29. What's that gotta do with anything? Then she becomes obsessed with becoming 30. You see, when women become obsessed with becoming 30, they evaluate their life on some, I don't know, gotta get married, love me, light shit and I just can't do that. I can't, I can't do it. What if you wrong? What if she's the one. Is Glenda the one? But you brought Todd. Yeah, I brought Todd and he'll probably embarrass me by the end of the night. You know men got dumb ass in their DNA. Yeah, maybe we shouldn't do this tonight. I don't know. We still trying to figure that out. See, you just like me. Hm? It's the same shit, man. I'm leaving mine because she's getting old. You not leaving yours 'cause you too young and you don't know where to go after this. Its the same shit, man. Just different ends of the spectrum, that's all. Me and you are nothing alike. It's fine. Yeah, you ready for round, oh you are ready for round three? Girl down it, take it to the head. Okay, come on let's do this. Now, what's the story with you not telling me about your friend over there? Babe, there's no story. You know I hate reminiscing. You know that about me. That's some bullshit. It was a guy, wasn't it? - No. - It was a guy. It's always a guy. Help me out, Todd. Oh I'm, nah, I don't have nothing to do with that. I'm gonna need another glass. Are you sure you can handle another glass? That's not the cheap stuff. Okay, you know what, I can handle mines but can you afford to keep pouring? Oh. I like this one. Where have you been hiding this one? Uh-uh, I'm a grown ass woman. Babe, babe, one more. No, a little bit, yep. Todd? All right. Todd, Todd? Are you sure you're gonna be able to control this one? I wouldn't dare try. Yeah, he couldn't even if he tried. So you're the alpha in the relationship? I mean, we just talking. I'm not offending you with this question, am I? Uh-uh. No, that's okay. Brian, he's just playing the provocateur. He's just clearly had just a little bit too much to drink. No, hold on now. Have I ever shied away from a good conversation? No. Baby, am I allowed to answer this question? Go full alpha if you need to, babe. So, you know I hate to answer a question with a question but what's wrong with an alpha female? I never said there was anything wrong with being an alpha female. I just asked if you were the alpha in the relationship. Yeah, I know what you asked. But I also know what you implied. He didn't mean anything by it. He's just... No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hey, Brian. We're just talking, right? Yeah. I'm not offending you with my question, am I? No, no, no. There's nothing wrong with an alpha female. I mean, if you like that kind of thing. You see, but that, right there, that's what's wrong with a black alpha female. Oh, now we're getting more specific. I took you as a realist. So, I was just keeping it real. I insist. Now I'm speaking generally, right? Okay. Black women are single more than other races. Oh okay. All right, so you're saying I'm good enough to fuck but I'm not good enough to marry. Is that where we're going with this? No, you know what? 40% of black women in your age group have never been married as opposed to 14% of white women in the same age group. Black women with a college degree are less likely to be married than white women without a degree. Now why is that? You know what? I'm sure you're gonna tell me. I'm not trying to start anything. No, I mean it's too late, brother. Go ahead, the floor is yours. Right, exactly. Now, listen to me. A lot of us black people have had to grow up without fathers and black women have had to be so strong where softness was a sign of weakness. So black women never really learned to trust men. A man, black, white, red, yellow, or brown, right? We don't like to look across the table at that hard demeanor. We like something soft to come home to. Women of other races understand that. That's all I'm saying. Hm, all right. You see, see, I knew this was a sore subject. But I'm not talking about us. We are four beautiful, black people that have beat the odds. Right? But Todd, help me out. The sisters can be a bit much. Man, I ain't helping you dig your own grave. Uh-uh, wait a minute. You can like a Latina, an asian woman, a white woman if you want to. You know what, just don't group me in that. I'm very comfortable with who I am. Wait a minute, me personally, I've never dated outside my race. All right, whatever. I love me some y'all. Uh-uh, uh-uh. You're telling me, you've never dated a woman outside your race? And it hasn't been conscious. It just happened to pan out that way. What, do you have a problem dating outside your race? Look, love is love. You know, the world is already hard enough as it is. Who you love shouldn't make things harder. I couldn't have said it better myself. How about you, Todd? You ever date a white woman? Huh? Todd? Have you ever dated outside your race? Um, um, yeah sure. What, I mean I've dated white women before. Women, as in plural? I mean yeah, a few. I mean, it's like she just said, right? The world is hard enough as it is, so who you love shouldn't make things harder. So you were in love with a white woman? Come on Brian, you ask me some shit like that? Todd, why can't you answer the question? I bet you need that glass of wine now, don't you? Yeah, you know. Look, okay, you know what. I was engaged, once, okay. It was a long time ago. I mean, shit was stupid. How did that not come up? I didn't know that. What was her name? I just said it was a long time ago. No, it wasn't that long ago. You can't remember her name? Rebecca. Come on, get the fuck out of here. Really, of all names? Becky? How long were you together? I don't wanna talk about this right now. I've been with you for five months and you've been engaged to a white woman named Becky. When was that supposed to come up? We can talk about it later. No, we gonna talk about it right now. - Are you serious? - Yes, right now! I don't know these people. You want me to talk about this shit in front of them? Do you still love her? No, I don't still love her. Do you still love her? I don't still love this woman, all right. Come on, you know I don't like talking about my shit in front of people, you know that! - Do you hear me? - Yes. Okay. Nah, let me look. Know what she is on Instagram. Damn, it's all white girls. It's white women. Really, Todd? Am I the first black woman you've ever dated? I've dated one black girl before, okay. I dated one black girl when I was kid, but okay, I guess I'm guilty. I'm on trial now, right? Yeah, yeah. Okay, you got me, all right. I, most women I've been with are from other races. So what am I? Like, some exotic plaything 'til you get back to Becky? Wow, I am so glad you convinced me to do this. You know what, I've dated one black girl when I was a kid. And you know what, she was a damn good one, too. Oh, oh, oh, really? Fuck this shit, I ain't gotta. One, one, one? You see this, man, see this. I think your boyfriend is leaving. Uh, wait, wait. You ain't leaving with my car, though. Todd, Todd! Oh my god, I gotta go get her. No, no, no. You're gonna go get another bottle of wine and stay out of the grown folks business. They're fine. Come on. Babe. What? You're hurting me. Just because I put up with your friend's disrespect does not mean I'm going to put up with yours. I'm sorry. Now go get another bottle of wine. She left her purse in the living room. That means she's coming back. Please. That way. You know, you keep acting like a little bitch. Hey, you ain't got too many more times to talk to me like that. You know what, I say what I wanna say when I wanna say it. Okay, that was the last time. No, okay, where you going? Anywhere away from you. You're kidding me. You're gonna walk down this neighborhood? They're gonna call the cops on your black ass. I'm done with this shit man, for real. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Just please wait a minute, all right. I shouldn't have talked to you like that in front of them, okay. You can't talk to me like that period. Well, I was embarrassed and defensive. Why does my past even matter, huh? I don't ask you about yours. Are you serious? We don't talk about shit. All we do is fuck. This is like even the first time we've even been out as as a... As a what? Yeah, nothing. As a couple? Yeah, yeah, as a couple. - I thought you ain't get into that shit. - Oh god. No, no, I thought you was the type that couldn't be tied down, right? I mean, that's what you said. - Man, I know what I said! - I don't think you do. You said, keep shit casual. Those are your words. You're gonna hold me to some shit that I said when we first got together? When we first hooked up? Really? Because is that when you did when you first met Becky? Did she come to you and say, oh you know what, I like, want a serious, monogamous relationship and matching bank accounts. Are you fucking kidding me right now? So we back to the white girl thing now, huh? That is not what matters. Do you know how it makes me feel when you hold out on a whole fiance and I can't even get an Instagram live post. You know what, it's because I dance, huh? What? - Yeah. - No. Yeah. No, it's not about that. It's nothing to do with your job. You know what, it's because I dance. Because we never go anywhere. Are you ashamed of me? Because you weren't ashamed last night when you were between my thighs rubbing on this big black ass. You were real comfortable then. Do you hear yourself right now? Yes, I hear myself. No man puts his girl on an Instagram page. Glenda, I don't give a fuck about your job. It's not about that. Okay, yeah. Well. Okay, okay, maybe a little bit. I don't know. Who wants their woman's ass in another man's face every night? I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. Why can't you just be fucking honest all the time? I mean, do you tell people about me? Do they know about that? Look, that's different, okay. That was something you couldn't control. You were provoked and you were 17. All right, there was three white kids attacking you. What were you supposed to do? Well that judge didn't give a fuck, all right. He didn't care that I was defending somebody from them racist assholes. He charged me as an adult! 17 years old, I got four years assault felony and I still gotta live with that shit. Well, it's not my business to tell, right. And honestly, I think it's bull shit because I don't think I have to explain myself to anyone. So why can't that be my reason? Because I know how you think. Oh, you have no idea how I think. No idea. What I thought I knew was that we were on the same page with this shit. You said, keep it casual. Those are your words, Glenda. God, I know what I said. That was like at the beginning. Obviously, things between us have changed. We just need to be able to have an open dialogue, right? Thought we didn't do that. Thought we was just out here fucking. Oh my god, Todd why do you keep twisting my words. I'm a 33 year old woman. They're taking so long outside. Someone's gonna call the police. This is Harper Oaks, babe. Exclusion is part of the price of staying here. Look, I'm over here trying to keep my composure while you inside playing mind fuck games with mother fucking "Nip/Tuck" in there. Whatever. No, not whatever. I ain't stupid, all right. Don't think I don't know what you're really doing here. Man, you don't know shit. I know I can't do this no more. I don't know what you want anymore, Glenda. I'm not a mind reader. Well do you have ears? Do you have ears? Because I said I'm not fucking anyone else. Okay. And let's go back inside. Looks like she's coming back. You should move away from the window. Oh my gosh. Are you okay? Girl, I'm fine. You, no you can't smoke in this house. Where can I smoke? Babe, I'm gonna take her in the back just too cool off. All right, babe? Mm-hm, that's okay. Mwah. Take your time. All right. Come on. Alpha females. She made him walk. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bring all of this into your house. It was not a part of the plan, I'm sure. Its okay. What? I've been doing this shit since high school. Doing what? Really? Falling in love. Falling out of love. Somewhere in between. This boy is like 28. 28 and a few months, okay. I gave him his down payment on his shop. Literally everything I had. Honestly, I don't even know why I did it. What are you talking about? What are you doing to yourself? Glenda? You want me to be honest? Yes. You want honesty? Glenda. I'm jealous. I'm a jealous bitch. - No. - I am. You're a drunk bitch. You're the most selfless person I know. Girl, please. Selfless is the jealous person's work uniform, all right. You know what, I know you hate me for recruiting you into the game. Oh, no, no, no. I don't hate you. Yeah, well, I manipulated you and you should. When you walked in the club I knew you weren't a lifer. Glenda you're not a lifer. Girl, I've been dancing since I was 18. I'm like five years away from the club framing my thong. But look at you. I know you, you're different, look at this. All right, we were chasing ball players and rappers. You fucking stalked a doctor. A fucking doctor. You bright little bitch. Okay, so when you start fixing your tits you got away from all of this and you never looked back. It's not even like that. Mm-mm. I'm not like that anymore. You've always been 10 steps ahead. So when you hit me up, I knew you had something planned up your sleeve. Look, it's me. I know you have something planned. You gonna let me in on it? There, there's nothing to let you in on. I don't have anything planned. I just wanted to see my girl. Okay. When'd you start smoking? Babe, I think we should start winding things down, sweetie. And I can I get you a car? Obviously you're in no condition to drive. Babe, we're just talking for a little bit longer. You know what, I'm kinda tired. I think I'm gonna go take a nap. You join me? Yeah? Okay. And can you spruce things up before you come? Can you do it now? Thank you. Come on, we gotta go back in. Can I help? No, I got it. No, this is already embarrassing enough. I need the address for the Lyft driver. Did you know I was there the night you met Latavia? No, she never told me that. Okay, so you don't remember me from the night? No. Okay. All right, it was like, I guess the playoff games. Every baller was in the room. Every bad dancer was there and you don't remember anything else from that night? No, I remember that night but I don't remember you from that night. Okay, so you remember everything else. But you don't remember me. Nope. - From any other night? - Nope. I mean, how could you. So many baddies in the room, you know what I'm saying. And I'm just kinda curious, why? You know, I wish someone would've chosen me. But what was it about Latavia? What was it? Yeah. What was it about Latavia that caught your eye? I mean yeah, she's one our baddies, but damn, I gotta know. You got her looking like a fucking super model. Living in this house. You think I'm superficial, don't you? Of course I do. I mean, you think I'm basic. Oh, pretty much. Oh so. So. All right, so what was it about Lala? I, you know, she was looking for an out. And looking in her eyes you could tell that she would do anything to get out of the situation she was in. Yeah, so you were being like some savior or some shit, right? Pretty much, yeah. I like a project. I can tell. So, fix me. Excuse me? I mean, hypothetically if I was on your operating room table, what would you do to fix me? Carve me up. Honestly? Honestly. How would you improve me? May I? Yes, you may. I think that I would. What the? Tavia, okay, it doesn't look. It's not what it looks like, okay. What, he was just. Girl, I'm sorry, okay. It's not what it looked like. No, it's okay. It's his job. If he didn't touch your breasts it would have been a strange night. Why don't you go in the closet and pick something out - that you like. - What? Let me get this stain out, give me your clothes. Damn. Anything? Are you sure? 'Cause you know, I drank a lot and I may have come off way too flirty. No, it didn't seem like that. Kinda scary how un-mad you are right now. He's a plastic surgeon. That's what he does. It's no big deal. Well look, I just really wanted to have one nice conversation with him before he kicked me out. Now things just seem really weird. Just take something, whatever you want. Pick out something and give me your clothes and I'll wash 'em, okay? Yep, I really thought it was time for me to leave. You know, I used to love to watch you dance. You taught me how to become a woman. Wait did you just, I taught you how to be a woman? I don't know if that's a compliment because I have done a lot of things I'm not proud of. I always wanted your natural shape but I wanted the plastic surgery but I didn't want all this. I wanted to look more like you. I always liked how you look. Yeah, you know, take whatever you want. Oof. Babe. I know. I only smoked a little bit of it, look. The doctor said I was fine. Put the cigar out. Is it okay if my friend? No, no. She stays the night? No, no, no. She wants to stay over 'cause she's drunk. Babe, come here. What? Let me kiss you. You finish that bottle of wine with me and fuck me all night and maybe she can stay. Two weeks, what does that, oh. Two weeks. Two weeks? Wow, you were right. I do like that dress. You know, if you wore that, hm, things might be a little different around here. Come on, you can stay in the guest room. Mm, mm, mm, mm. Girl this home. Come on. This is the guest room, come on, get in. Uh-uh, come on. No, no, goodnight, Glennie. Oh my god, I keep striking out with you. You really have changed, huh? Mm-hm. I really hate how things ended between us. You know that right? Well, it's not over yet. Just get some rest and I'll see you in the morning, okay? But I just put this dress on. Oh well, you don't have to take it off right away, just keep it on. Hey, you know, I'm happy for you girl. I am glad you called. Me too. Babe. Babe! I need some water, I forgot. I forgot to take my medicine. Could you? Mm. Oh, shit. What the hell do I keep you around for? You going somewhere? Hey. I didn't know anyone was awake. I was just gonna head out. At this hour? Yeah, I have a lot to do. What you got to do? Why don't you just stay? I'll take you home. Are you sure? Yeah, no big deal. Am I sure, of course I'm sure. You ain't in no condition to drive. Come on, it's the least I can do. All right, thank you. Can I ask you a question? Can I stop you? What happened between you and my wife? Oh, there are not enough hours in the day. Was it you and a man? Really, why do you guys always think all our problems revolve around you? So what happened? Well, she found out the truth about me and she could never look at me the same. So what's the truth about you? The truth is that I'm a user and I destroy everything I care about. And what do you care about? Uh-uh, nope, no more questions. All right? I remember. I knew who you were the second you walked in the house. I just didn't know what to say because I didn't know if it was a setup. A setup? Yeah, a setup. Yeah you see, we've been going through some issues. My heart condition didn't make anything any easier, you know. I started going through her phone, checking her emails, seeing if she was up to something. But I didn't find nothing. You see I need, I need excitement or else I'll die. And it seemed like she knew the boredom would kill me, but she just didn't care. Mm, so you need excitement 24 hours a day? Yeah, 24 hours a day. I married a stripper, what do you expect? Latavia, she loves you, okay. So, why are you even so paranoid? I've been through a divorce. I know the signs. Okay, so can I ask you one last question? No, I'm not answering any questions. No please, just one more question. Okay. What was it that you remember about me when I walked through that front door? I just wanted you to keep your mouth shut. About what? What you mean about what? You know what we did that night. - Mm. - Mm-hm. I'm good at keeping my mouth shut. You must really, really care about Tavia. 'Cause this is gonna destroy her. Mm-mm, it's not about destroying her. It's about getting what's mine. ♪ Baby in the summertime ♪ In the summertime ♪ Baby in the summertime ♪ In the summertime ♪ Baby, in the summertime ♪ In the summertime ♪ Baby, in the summertime ♪ In the summertime ♪ These views ain't too bad in the summertime ♪ ♪ Like a sky and the sunshine ♪ Man, cool breeze like a lifeline ♪ ♪ Take my cruise at the dead of night ♪ ♪ Been hard times, but its been all right ♪ ♪ Telling me that its good for life ♪ ♪ Keys green like the lake water ♪ ♪ Standard coupe that's a big order ♪ ♪ Add loops through fresh water ♪ ♪ This sun, yeah don't worry ♪ Ain't gonna burn ya ♪ We had to fit the coat ♪ Learn to live in the cold ♪ Past lives in the snow ♪ Filling holes in the road ♪ Baby, in the summertime ♪ In the summertime ♪ Baby, in the summertime ♪ In the summertime ♪ Baby, in the summertime ♪ In the summertime ♪ Baby, in the summertime ♪ In the summertime What's wrong? Oh my God! Oh my God! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Shut the fuck up. I need to think. Okay. Should we call the police? Should we just call 911? Shut the fuck up! Look in my bathroom there are two pill bottles. There's one red and there's one blue. Just go get 'em. Okay! You are so fucking predictable. So fucking predictable. I knew this was gonna happen. Been waiting to kill you. You gotta help me. You gotta. You gotta help me. You gotta help me. I am helping you. I'm helping to kill you. You deserve to die. You stupid bitch. No matter what I did, you just wouldn't die. You just kept getting worse as a human being. So I had to put you behind me. I had to put you behind me, so I had to go find some shit from my past to keep you from coming into my future. You won't get, get a dime. I got a prenup. Yeah, well I have a life insurance policy on your ass. You so arrogant. You assumed that our marriage would be over before you expired. You stupid ass fuck. Is he dead? Get out of my house! Wait, please I just need to explain. You slept with my husband and now he's dead. I think I get it. You know what, you haven't changed. You always wanted that flashy, shiny coin. You couldn't resist. You always wanted what was mine. - What does that mean? - What I had! You were in this, you were jealous. I even saw it tonight. You couldn't stop talking. I saw you, always had to have the last say. You always. I saw you at the dinner table with Todd and Brian. What, did you put? You planned this. You planned this, didn't you? I can't believe it. You fucking bitch. You fucking bitch! God damn it! Hello? Yeah, 911, yeah. I found my husband he's unresponsive. I need an ambulance here. Yeah, hurry. He's unresponsive, hurry. Hey, baby. Aw, let me see this. Thought she would never die. Yeah. I didn't think she'd go inside a coma. Car crashes can be unpredictable. You think the police are gonna ask us anymore questions? How? Nobody knew we dated. Her blood alcohol level was .37 at the time of the crash. No one suspected I manipulated the brakes. Hey, got this in the mail. Oo. Yeah. Oh good. - Money, girl. - Yes. Mm, mm. You look as beautiful as the first night we met. You've always protected me. I'm gonna always have your back. - You are? - Mm-hm. Well, thank you. Mm. You know, I just realized I never made love to a millionaire. Well, I'll fix that when I get back, okay? All right.
