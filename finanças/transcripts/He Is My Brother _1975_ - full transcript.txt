NARRATOR: In ancient times there was one disease feared above all others, leprosy. In the 19th century when the disease broke out in the Hawaiian Islands governments panicked, heads of state acted rashly, and cruelly. Any victim who showed signs of the disease was uprooted from his home and sent to a remote island, forced to live the rest of his life in total isolation. The lepers lived in fear and shame without houses, crops, sanitation, nor medical help of any kind. The island was nothing more than an inhumane prison that turned lepers into animals struggling for survival. Then a priest came to live among these people. His name was Joseph Damian. At first the lepers were suspicious. Who was this god he served? Damien began to work with the people then building houses and improving their living conditions. He shamed the government into increasing the meager shipments of food, clothing, and medical supplies. He set up a school to educate the children. After 16 years of service Damien himself fell victim to leprosy, but not before giving hope to these people and bringing worldwide attention to their plite. Our story, although fiction, is inspired by the works of Damien and based on his successor to the island a man whom we call Brother Dalton. Almost at once Brother Dalton was confronted by the Kahuna, once a spiritual leader who had lost control when the lepers turned to Christian teachings. In his bid to regain power the Kahuna contended that leprosy was a curse brought to Hawaii by the white man. And that if the whites were driven out the plague would go with them. The people listened, for the Kahuna emphasized his message through what seemed to be supernatural feats. It was during this time of tension that two brothers tragically arrived on the island.

[MUSIC PLAYING] Oh god. Oh god. [CRYING] [BUGLE SOUNDS] -Now, I don't want anybody speaking to our guests yet. I will introduce them to you after breakfast. Now remember, no baseball or fishing until all your beds are made up and I want that porch swept clean. Understand? [INAUDIBLE] Come on. No time to waste. Breakfast in one hour. Hinu? Come here. -What smells? It's awful. -[INAUDIBLE]. How do you feel today? -I think I'll be all right. What's the matter with your face? -Only my leper [INAUDIBLE] that's all. -[INAUDIBLE]. -He's never seen blonde hair before. He thinks you're some kind of a baby Hawaiian spirit. [LAUGHS] Hinu here will be your guide as long as you're here. And, uh, if you ask him to he speaks pretty good English. -Righto. English [INAUDIBLE]. -Ah, you see. He's [INAUDIBLE] show off. [LAUGHS] [PLAYING BUGLE BADLY] Hinu, not now. Not, not now. Now what you do is you keep Randy out of trouble. That's for today and tomorrow. Do you understand? Well, how would you like to go and find some eggs for breakfast with Hinu? -Yes. -Come on. We got [INAUDIBLE]. JEFF: Leprosy? Get away! Get away! Don't come near me! God, you've been, you've been feeding me all this time. -Son, you're all right. You're not going to catch anything. -What you mean I'm not going to catch anything? Look. They're all around me! Randy, come here! Randy! -Now look, boy. Randy's all right. -He might be all right now, but what about tomorrow or the day after that? -Will you stop it? There's a boat coming tomorrow. You do not catch leprosy in two days. -My god, where are we? BROTHER DALTON: In a settlement for lepers. -Are you all right? -I certainly am. How'd you like a 10 pound soft boiled egg for breakfast? [INAUDIBLE] for my brother. -Just stay away from these people. They're all diseased. -I'll take care of him. Hinu, you go collect the eggs by yourself. You come with me, Randy. Oh, it's OK. I'm clean. See? Come on. -What's wrong with Randy? -He's perfectly all right. So I see no reason to him about what has happened as yet. I mean, by the time-- Jeff? Jeff? Jeff, listen to me. Now the lord must have had some reason for sparing your life. You're young, you're healthy. You've got much to look forward to. Look at these people all around you. They have so much less than you. -I don't want to look at them. -Kiko, I don't think he appreciates us. -Ah, I take him to luau tonight. Maybe get fella little bit [INAUDIBLE]. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Good, huh? [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [APPLAUSE] -Good, good, good. Eh, you like, huh? More wine? [CROWD CHATTERING] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Thank you. [CROWD CHATTERING] -You're Kahuna has come again to ask you to return to the old ways. The ways of your gods. For they alone can take your afflictions from you. In the old days the land was yours and you didn't have to work. Now they land belongs to the white man and you are poor. [INAUDIBLE] when you are sick they put you in prison. -Enough. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Have given me the power to do this. Can your white god make any of you this strong. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I don't believe it. -Jeff! -That's really hot. How'd you-- -[INAUDIBLE]! [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -If I had fallen into the pit and died it would have nothing compared with the issue you have given the gods by destroying the bones of our ancestors. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Days ago I prayed that [INAUDIBLE] would spare your life and send you to me. Now I can see your spirit is [INAUDIBLE]. -Brother Dalton! [INAUDIBLE] at the luau. Come. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. That is your blood, Mr. Remington. The gods have spoken for it. Each day your spirit will sink further into the earth. When it is gone you will be no more. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. It is no matter. The bones have been destroyed. Perhaps is it the wishes of the gods that our race be no more. -Why don't you go back to the other side of the island where you belong. You leave that alone. Don't [INAUDIBLE]. trickery. -Tricks, Brother Dalton? -My dear friend-- -I have a trick for you! [BUGLE SOUNDS] -Oh. -What's the matter? Gottem big head from last night? Don't worry. I stay outside. You no catch lepera. That's for your head. -Thanks. Where'd these come from? -Say, somebody give you strong [INAUDIBLE] spirit to protect you. -Huh? -Look like you're going to need it. [LAUGHS] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. BROTHER DALTON: Hinu? -Almost. -Hinu, now your job for today is to keep an eye on master Remington here until his ship arrives. You understand? Good boy. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. -What's [INAUDIBLE]? -Whenever Brother Dalton make [INAUDIBLE] funny face, we hide [INAUDIBLE]. -Oh. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. before breakfast! -Oh, no.

I go get them. -Now you've got nothing to worry about. Why don't you go with him if you think you can keep up. I'm gonna take this mail to boat. [ANIMAL WHISTLING] -Good morning, Master Remington. I've been waiting to meet you. -Nice to make your acquaintance sir. I was just following a bird with the most lovely call. -I know. HINU: Kiko! Mr. Jeff! -Hey, what you do up there? You come down here. -Where's Randy? -He went up in the mountain. Follow some bird I don't hear. -That bird you heard. I think he lives [INAUDIBLE]. Would you like to see it? -He lives in a cave? -Yes. Come. -Randy? Randy? -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. -Randy? Randy? Randy? -Right here, Jeff! --[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE], if those are [INAUDIBLE] I want them taken to the girls settlement. -OK, Brother Dalton. -[INAUDIBLE]! you ask the captain if he'll wait a little longer for those boys. -He said no. [INAUDIBLE]. -[INAUDIBLE] Jeff. -[INAUDIBLE] hurry up. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Come on. -I'm coming. -Shut up. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Wait! Wait! -Hey, Jeff? You gonna cry? -No, I'm not gonna cry. I'm gonna kick your little behind all the way down to the beach. Dalton! Why didn't you tell them to wait? You knew we had to get out of this place. Why wasn't somebody watching my brother? When will the boat be back? -In three weeks. -Three. How long will it take us to walk another port on the other side of the island? -The soldiers up on that mountain won't let you through the pass without permission of the government. -Dammit. What are you trying to do? We stay here another day we'll catch leprosy for sure. -I've been trying to catch leprosy for 10 years. -Trying? What kind of a person are you? -I don't know what kind of a person I am. I can tell you what kind of a person I was. I was a reckless, arrogant young people fool yourself. Now I'm trying to pay for my sins. Trying to help these people. And in helping them I'm helping myself. -You are crazy. -I know this is a miserable place. I need help to keep it going. I wish to god I could get help. I'd give my right arm for help, but I don't need an immature brat like you to come along and create a problem with the Kahuna. -What are you talking about? -I have tried my damnedest for years to avoid a confrontation with that witch doctor. Last night I jeopardized this entire settlement to save your neck. You're the biggest pain in the ass I ever met. I wish I were rid of you! -You're nuts! [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHILDREN PLAYING] -[INAUDIBLE] Hinu, get me down. [INAUDIBLE] Help! -Randy! What are you doing? Come on. Get off of there right now. Told you to stay away from these kids. -My turn. -Then with whom am I going to play? I cannot okay with you because you're such a grouch. -Never mind that. -Randy, help! -I'm coming. Now get off of him. -Randy! Get off of him. What'd I just tell you? Now I want you to go and wash right now. And I mean scrub. Go on! [INAUDIBLE] What's the matter with you? Kiko? Kiko? -Yeah? -Have we got any rope? -In here. [MUSIC PLAYING] -What do you think, Kiko? -Good. -All right. Come on. Don't you wanna get on it? OK. Go ahead. Uh, too high, I'm afraid. OK. Hang on there. OK. Now hold on real tight. Hold on-- Are you ready? -Yeah. -There you go. You like that? -Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GIGGLING] -Hello. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Pardon me? -I'm [INAUDIBLE]. -Did you give these to me? --[INAUDIBLE] for gods, [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. -What? -What's the matter? You no speak English or what? -[LAUGHS] No, I guess not. -Come. GROUP: Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done. Honored as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. [INAUDIBLE] trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. are waiting for the people. -God will protect you. God will to protect you. The Kahuna can do you no harm. -You are right, Brother Dalton. I cannot harm my people. Your white demon god is harming them. Before the white men came we had no leprosy here. [INAUDIBLE] has just killed three more of my people. There is no need to die from this disease. If you make prayers and offerings to your own gods, they will cure you. How can you be satisfied with a white man's god when all he gives you is pain and death? -And this devil will give you nothing but lot of tricks. You look on the other side of that roof and you'll find a servant of the Kahuna hiding there. -There's no one here. -Brother Dalton, have you looked at your spear lately? It's almost gone. What are you going to do now that my people no longer listen to you? -Dalton! -You stupid white man. You never know when you're beaten. That is your virtue and your shortcoming. [MUSIC PLAYING] -[INAUDIBLE]. -[INAUDIBLE]. We need more [INAUDIBLE]. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You remember now, don't you? -I miss them so much. -I know, Randy. They're with us in spirit. They gave us enough love to last a lifetime. -But I still miss them. -Me too, pal. But we're alive. Pretty soon we're gonna get off this island. -Jeff? -Huh? -How come all you ever think is getting off this island? Why do you hate these people so? -I don't hate them, Randy. Just don't us to catch leprosy from them. That's all. -Kahuna says it was the white man who brought the disease here. -The Kahuna would say anything to regain his power. -Aren't you afraid of the spears? When they sink into the ground something terrible will happen to you and Dalton. -No, I'm not afraid. They're just tricks, Randy. -I don't know. It's different with the Kahuna. When he looked into my eyes, [INAUDIBLE] really strange. Like something was controlling me. -Randy, listen to me. Many years ago the Kahuna lost his power of these people. Well, now he senses Dalton is becoming week and he's using ever trick he knows to win these people back. And you know and I know that's all it is. It's just tricks. Just wish I could prove that to a few others around here. -Then [INAUDIBLE] like the people on this island, don't you, Jeff? -Yeah, I guess I do. They're very warm people. [INAUDIBLE] Feel like taking a walk. -OK. -Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] -[INAUDIBLE] won't see me again. I asked her if she'd go to the hospital in Honolulu to have her baby. [INAUDIBLE] [BANGING] [INAUDIBLE] way we won't have to be around when the Board of Health takes the baby away. -Mrs. [INAUDIBLE], Brother Dalton's not coming in with me. Mrs. [INAUDIBLE]? -Go away. We okie dokie. -You must bathe and change your bandages. You understand? -Okie dokie. -Baby. Honolulu. Baby. -Mrs. [INAUDIBLE], your baby's due in a month. Would like to take a boat to Honolulu? -Kahuna help us with baby. -Brother Dalton. -What are you doing here? -Well, we were having dinner. -Well, I thought you were going to eat with us over at my place. -Randy! Just because I let those boys help me with the swing doesn't mean you can start living with them. Now. You've been eating with them. Come on. -[INAUDIBLE]. It's all right, isn't it, Brother Dalton? I'm not gonna catch anything am I? -What's the matter with him? -The people have been rejecting our help. He could stand some cheering up. -All right. I'll try. Uh, no thank you. -Well, all of us need a little every now and then. -Brother Dalton, I've, um, had a chance to think. And I think I'm beginning to understand what's going on around here. I just want to say I'm sorry if I caused any trouble. -Well, that's all right, Jeff. Wasn't your fault what happened with the Kahuna. No matter what you would have done he'd have found some way to force a show down. -It's only voodoo and doesn't work unless you believe in it. -You don't believe in it and I don't believe in it, but those people out there believe in it. -Are you sure you don't believe in it? -Well, they're tricks. That's all. You run along. I'm just going to sit here for a few moments and cool off. Go ahead. -You sure you're all right? -Sure, of course I'm all right. [INAUDIBLE]. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HUMMING] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. What you are doing you know will bring you great unhappiness. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. -Maybe it is better you don't spend so much time with that young man. What happens when he leaves? You have been preparing this for awhile. Your grandmother used to make the [INAUDIBLE] and the [INAUDIBLE] for me. -You should be telling her not to interfere with the wishes of the [INAUDIBLE]. He must die. -Jeff die? -He does not care for you. He's a liar like all whites. [INAUDIBLE], you already have enough sorrows in your life. I only want to spare you more. -Let your daughter be. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. -Let her have it. She needs it! -Those Christian liars have turned your head, too. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. -Luanu? Hello. Hey, something smells good. -You come too soon. Dinner not ready yet. -Oh, that's all right. I've got a surprise for you. -Surprise? -See if can guess what it is. -Flower? -No. -Baseball? -Baseball. No. This was my mother's. And I want you to have it. -You give this to me? -Why don't you put it on? Oh. Okie dokie? -Now. -It's beautiful. -Come. You sit down. And I will dance for you. Luanu's dance tells story of Jeff and Luanu. [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -(SINGING) You are close to heart. You are close to my own heart and this heart I give, it is yours for you alone. [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -[INAUDIBLE] means dear heart. [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -(SINGING) I am [INAUDIBLE] yours. I am close to heart. I am close to your own heart. And your heart you give, you give to me alone. [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -I want for kiss you, but [INAUDIBLE] say boy can kill girl, but girl no can kiss boy. Only married women can kiss man. Or else, [INAUDIBLE]. marriage. -Luanu. -I know. -Will you come with me when I leave here? -Come. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANING] -This is beautiful. Can see any of this from down below. -Long ago King [INAUDIBLE] make big battle here. Many warrior die. So we not stay for long. -Why not? I feel like we can see the whole world from up here. -[INAUDIBLE]. Ghost come sometimes. -Then, uh, why did you bring me up here? -You could pass over mountain over here. Only Kahuna [INAUDIBLE] know pass. You want to leave here now? I could show you. -I think I'll wait for the boat. -This magic leaping off place. You kiss me here and you'll never leave me. [WAILING SOUNDS] Oh, we come here at wrong time. -What do you mean? -[INAUDIBLE] ghosts come. [INAUDIBLE] Only relative of warriors can look. [INAUDIBLE] -Come on. We better get back before the [INAUDIBLE]. [DRUM BEATING] -Are you all right? -Yeah, I guess so. -Well, where have you been? -Trying to figure out what to do next. -What's going on? -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. -Yes, I think our problems are just about over, Father Ambrose. Only birds, angels, and devils can really fly. -There was Leonardo DaVinci. -DaVinci did not fly. He almost killed himself. -Scientifically, he did fly. It was just the people of that time they wouldn't accept it. -If the Pope hadn't have intervened he would have been executed for consorting with the devil. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -What's Kiko doing? -Oh, that's the only vice Kiko has. He'll bet on anything [INAUDIBLE]. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Watch out, Randy! -Help! -Stop Randy! [MUSIC PLAYING] [YELLING] -Hey, look. There's another one. -Help! -Oh my god in heaven. It's Randy up there. -What? -Kiko, on the double! -[INAUDIBLE]. Help! [INAUDIBLE] -No! You stay here. Let's get it out! Go! -Didn't everybody see me? Wasn't I wonderful? -Randy, why did you do that? -I couldn't help it. [INAUDIBLE] lifted me up. -Come on, Randy. Don't me give me that. -Well, what do you think of him now? The boy just did what the Kahuna said he alone could do. Are you still afraid of his trickery? -You are a sign [INAUDIBLE]. You will be [INAUDIBLE]. Days ago I prayed that [INAUDIBLE] would spare your life and allow you to be my [INAUDIBLE]. -Sister Agnes, take the children and yourself away from here before they witness the kind of violence that men are sometimes driven to. You demented son of bitch. You would kill that beautiful child just to prove your witchcraft? If I ever see you around here again, I'm gonna break your goddamn neck. And may god damn my soul for it. -Brother Dalton will be dead by tomorrow from [INAUDIBLE]. Then we shall drive the rest of the white demons from this island. -Kiko, from now on I want you to keep your eye on Randy every second. -I'm not worried so much for Randy as for you, Brother. -You know you're right. I haven't been that angry since I was a foolish young man in the war. -I know that kind of anger. That anger only show [INAUDIBLE]. -I think I'll go to confession. -Look. Now you believe? [INAUDIBLE], the cave [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE] the shark god help you now. You go catch [INAUDIBLE] now. -What? -You must catch eel. -You mean in there? [MUSIC PLAYING] I can't find anything. -Go get eel! [MUSIC PLAYING] I got the eel, Jeff! Come, Jeff. Feed this to the eel. -What? -Feed to the eel. Now you throw back eel in water. -Luanu? Now what was that all about? -If you die, eel die, too. -Terrific. -Eel [INAUDIBLE] best friend. [INAUDIBLE] no wants the eel die. So you must not die. -I can't help it. I don't know what to do. I want to help these people. They won't listen to me anymore. And it's not because of the Kahuna. It's me. -Without your efforts, the settlement couldn't have lasted this long. -I've been jamming god down their throats. I've been taking from them. Not giving. -Brother Dalton, none of us can ever change who we are. -Everything. -We all have different ways of loving. -We're going to lose everything. -Dammit! You are the most bloody tempered, stubborn bull-headed man I've ever known. But I also have never known anyone was worked as hard as you have for the benefit of others. -Well, I feel that god's rejecting me. [INAUDIBLE] you're the only who knows the life I led before I came here. -Why do you think god has rejected you? -Because I can't stop the Kahuna. And because of this. I've wanted it for years. Well, I have it. Did it ever occur to you that god isn't rejecting you? That maybe you're rejecting god? -Rejecting god? -The Kahuna has convinced you. -But look at me! -Don't you see? If god is doing this to you, it's not the Kahuna's, but yours. And if your faith were as strong as the Kahuna's, you would trust in god. And believe. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [DRUM BEATING] -You miss anybody from where you come from? -Well, as a matter of fact I do. She lives right next door. She's blonde, beautiful blue eyes, and how she could kiss. It's only one problem though. She's only five years old. A little too long to wait, don't you think? Luanu, I was thinking that, uh, when Randy and I leave here, well, would you come with us? -But this my home. -I know that, but there's no future for you here. And your people are, are trying just to survive for today without any thought of tomorrow. Luanu, there's so much of the world to see. And there's so much to do. -What you do when you go back? -Well, my father's a, my father was an inventor. I guess I'll just pick up where he left off. -What is that inventor? -Well, it's when you create something new, usually to make things better for people. -You invent cure for our [INAUDIBLE]? --[LAUGHS] Well, I'm not that kind of inventor. I do know that doctors and scientists are working on that right now. And actually it's not as bad I thought. It can be controlled and maybe some day even cured. -You want make better for people, why you no stay here and help? -I just can't continue to let Randy be exposed to the leprosy. I'm not even sure I could ever get used to being around lepers. Luanu, what are you doing? Luanu? Oh my god. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Randy? Come with me. [ROOSTER CROWS] [CROWD CHATTERING] -Hey, what's going on? -Kahuna's got Randy. -What? -Kahuna got Randy. -Dalton! Dalton! He's got Randy! He'll kill him. We gotta stop him. Dalton! Please come with me! I need your help! -He can't hear you. He doesn't know. -What are you saying? Dalton, wake up! I need your help! -I can't help you. And I can't help myself. I'm dying. -You're dying? You told me you couldn't die from leprosy in a couple days, remember? -I've been praying [INAUDIBLE] every day. Every [INAUDIBLE] I pray. I'm sorry. -You're sorry. Why don't you stop feeling sorry for yourself? You pathetic drunk. Father Ambrose. What's the matter with you people? You all afraid of a lousy witch doctor? --[LABORED BREATHING] There's, there's only one way to help [INAUDIBLE]. You wanna know whose god is the strongest? I'll show you! -Does your mother have the sun in her hair like you? -Yes, she does. And at night her hair glows like silver. Mother? Mother? -Randy. You do want to be [INAUDIBLE], don't you? [GROANING] -Help me! Help me! Help! Help me? Pray with me. Please? Pray with me! -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. -No! -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. [STRUGGLING] -Father! [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Father, please. -Jeff! -Jeff! -Don't! -Randy! Randy? Randy, you all right? -I think so. -All right. [INAUDIBLE] stay with Brother Dalton. -OK. -Luanu? Luanu? Luanu? Luanu? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Have you been here all night? -Yeah. -Brother Dalton says the boat will be coming soon. I was thinking. When we go back, I would like to stay with Aunt Margarette. And I also thought we wouldn't be able to see each other as often. -Yes, and you also thought. -Well, in that case, we should stay here. To help. Brother Dalton could use your help. Even if it is for a little while. I love you, Jeff. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Now where did you get that spear. -[INAUDIBLE] gave it to me. -Oh, I see. Where's your brother? I hope he's not going to miss one, too. -Ah, [INAUDIBLE]. Didn't he tell you? [INAUDIBLE] But I have to get an education. -Oh, I see. Well, now when you get your education, and you decide you wanna come back here, you can come back. -But I'm perfectly capable of making that decision right now. -[LAUGHS] Aloha, Randy. -Bye, Kiko. -Take it out! -Aloha! -Aloha! Bye, Kiko! [MUSIC PLAYING]
