If you are viewing this video, then you are assisting the Federal Bureau or SIOP in our research. The footage found at the crime scene has been composited in order to give some consecutive understanding of the Hollows Grove incident. Much of the footage to follow comes from the camera of Harold Maxwell who was shooting a behind the scenes documentary on the SPIT. We hope you may be able to shed some light on these events. Wait, wait wait I see something. I'm feeling something. I'm feeling some... woah! What is that? What is that? Get it off, get it off! Holy smokes! Did you see that? Spirit and Paranormal Investigation Team. Yo, I'm so excited to do this. Well you stuck with us at school, this could have been your everyday gig. Don't remind me, man. Between the internship and Cindy, I mean that was my life. You talk with Cindy? No, not for two weeks. This should take your mind off her for a little while. Yeah. I always thought you two made a nice couple. Thanks, dick. Hey, sorry. Don't worry. Anyway, seriously thank you man. It's really nice to have a break from shooting those webisodes for Comedy In Your End-o. This will be a blast. Yeah, maybe it'll propel me onto better projects. Wait, is that a red light on? Aw shit, we're recording. Ass balls! Here we are with Tim Jacobs one of the stars of the Spirt and Paranormal Investigation Team. How did you get started with the SPIT? Well... the studio version is that my colleagues and I have vigoriously studied the paranormal and now we race around the world documenting haunted buildings and apparitions. And the real version? Alright, well Chad, Roger, and myself graduated Film Studies together and then after college we were tired of smoking skunk, bumping uglies with ogres and working craptastic 9 to 5 so we wanted to try our luck in show business. Where are we going? First to visit Bill. Who's Bill? Bill sets up gags for the show to scare us. Woah, he rigs stuff? Don't tell me you thought what we did was real. I mean, I thought some of it actually happened. Bill! Bill, where are you?! He uses all this stuff? Yeah, I guess. Where the hell is he? Bill! Wait, you hear that? Yeah, I heard something. Geez, what the hell?! Ah Geez, stop it, stop it, stop it! Stop stop! Damn it, stop it, stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stooop it! You alright? You son of a bitch! I had to do it, man. Bill! I got 'cha. You got my heart racing there, you... Aw, heck yeah, dude. I didn't know you'd be filming or I'd have made something more fantastic. No, that was more than enough. Harold, Bill, Bill, that's Harold. Hi. That was great man, that was one hell of an entrance. Hey buddy. Hey man, Harold's going to be joining us tomorrow on the hunt. Nice! Wait until you see what we got going tomorrow. Shit. I got to take this, hey Harold, interview Bill a sec, huh? Okay, yeah. Do you mind if I interview you? Sure. Awesome. So here we are with Bill... O'Neil. Bill O'Neil. Alright, so how did you get started with the SPIT? I worked effects in movies, television for 20 years. Retirement was coming, I met Tim. Thought it would be a fun opportunity and here we are, season 5. How do you like working with the guys? Oh, Tim is a sweetheart. Chad's great. He's all work work work, you know the guy. And Roger? Oh Roger, he's the son I wish I never had, but do. In other words... Pain in the ass. He makes me laugh once in awhile. 3D armadillo. Have you ever seen anything supernatural or scary in your job? The only thing that scares me is waking up next to my wife. Ouch. - That's a bold threat no, I'm just kidding. You are my cupcake. God damn it! Why don't you clean this place up, man? For who? Anyway, I brought your petty cash, here. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, we got to run, alright? Yeah. Hey man, hey thanks a lot. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you, but you won't see me. Bye bye! That's creepy. Bye bye! Okay, here we are at the SPIT editing home base. As you can see, Chad here is turning our low quality footage into a high quality show. Say hi, Chad. Hi. Sitting next to Chad here is one of our favorite segment producers, Julie. Thank you, more or less. Okay, our favorite. Okay, cool. This is where the gold's made. Yup, basically the show is us getting as much footage as we can while acting scared shitless. Nice, yeah it sounds exciting. Yeah, not really, but it beats waiting tables, yeah? That's true. Oh my God! Wow. Thanks jerk, you just fogged up the camera. Chadwick, pastrami on white. Thank you. Ms. Julie. Thank you, yay! Thanks for thinking of us, huh? Oh, but I did think of you. Oh, you are too kind. I know. Roger. And one for you. No, don't throw it, dude, come on. Harold, can you just cut me out of this? Because I don't want to be seen with these three stooges. I'll try. That's not what you said last night. It was more like, "Oh Roger, oh Tim, your huge rods" "fill me with everlasting bliss!" Hey, in America no one says rods. What were you doing last night? I was editing, I don't have time for threesomes. You know what? Fuck you. I would never do three guys at once. I'm only a two man gal. Oh snap! That's Julia. Speaking of which, Potter, you mind if I give Cindy a call? Let her massage the ol' bean bag? Really? Know what I'm saying? I'm talking about my balls. Why would you say that, Roger? Hey, come here. Come here. What? Come here. Coming. I mean do you think you're funny? Do you just get a rise out of the shit you say? I was kidding, dude. What, am I going to call Cindy? Look, he needs to be able to joke about this. Alright, well he has been our friend since college, so the least you can do is be a little understanding. You and I both know that she was railing dudes behind his back the whole time. Okay? This is the best thing that could happen to him. He's still trying to get over her. I understand that, dude! This is why we're letting him do this bullshit documentary. Okay? So while he's here, can you please try to be a little nice to him? I am being perfectly nice to him. This is a ridiculous conversation. Alright. I'm playing you again in foosball, let's go. Hey Harry, want to see something real scary? Yeah. Watch this. Hey! Hello! How are you? Yeah, Bill baby! Huh? This cute? What do you want to know? Well you're Serbian, right? Yes, originally. I moved to the states when I was 16 or so. You have family? I do. My life consists of my baby, my Millie, and SPIT. What are you doing, man? I'm doing an interview! Have you ever seen anything supernatural or anything that made you a believer? There were odd happenings. Wind and sealed off room... Seriously?! You've never seen anything paranormal? Um, well... Dude, come on, I'm doing an interview. - Sorry. - I'm sorry. See? Don't worry, I can cut that out. Yeah, where were we? Just a simple question, have you ever seen anything paranormal? Oh, right. Odd happenings, things in rooms like wind blowing in sealed off rooms with doors closed and strange noises. We had a lot of that. But no ectoplasmic activity though? No, not really, but my countryman Tesla, he believed in afterlife and the ghosts and he was a genius, so I'm in good company. Oh hey, there you guys are. My country man believes in ghosts and goat fucking! Goat fucking. That's Albania. It's just know over the board why don't you. He's like a bull in a china shop. Serbian style. Hey guys, let's get this going. Okay teacher, okay, ready for our lesson. Thank you. Up your nose with a rubber hose! Alright, tomorrow's no joke. We need to arrive at 4PM at Hollows Grove Orphanage. You don't be late. I love children. Hey, bro, they don't live there anymore. How do you know? It's abandoned. What's the background? Well, the orphanage was built... - 1927! - 1942! 1915. - Ugh. - Ah. To help young children find happy homes, that's why it was built. Hollows Grove stood operational until 1952. Many of the orphans were taken advantage of by the staff members. Some of the older kids would take advantage of the younger ones. It became... Sexually? Shut up! Of course sexually. Listen, guys, this place was awful. It became the place that time forgot. Why? Around 1922 people started dropping off kids that were unwanted. Those with disabilities... Watch your step, Harold. Mental health problems, write that down! Mental problems. That's good, the unwanted, I want to use that. Yeah, it became a makeshift hospital. It was horrible. Okay, I like it so far. Oh! According to the American Haunted House Association... - Number four! - Number four! No! Number two! This is going to be so good, yes. This is so exciting! Coming up in the world! It's good. Is there anything else? Well yeah, there is a story about a young girl named Lilah Calford. Listen up, you guys. She was brought into the institution in 1927 at seven years old. Psychiatrists thought that she had a severe personality disorder with violent tendencies. Usually caretakers just strapped her to a bed. Let me, guess... Yup, thank you, sorry about that. She went missing. Yes, she went missing. Yeah, apparently Lilah raided the kitchen... She wanted some fried chicken. Did she eat everything? No, you guys, listen! She went around to other kid's beds and started slitting their throats. For real? Yes! Caretakers found her passed out in the closet somewhere covered in blood. Right here. That's good. Yeah, and while they were trying to restrain her, she went ballistic and bit off a caretaker's tongue. With her mouth? Stop it! What? Thank you, stop. Details. Listen, and when they asked her why she committed all of these horrors, she said that God commanded her to do it. If she didn't, God would have forced her to cut out her own tongue. So she could, quote unquote, "Never speak of evils." Lovely. This is why I do not have children. Exactly, so there you have it. Study the information in your packets tonight, be there are 4PM you guys. I'm not... really, Roger?! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Listen, I'm going to kick your ass! I'm going to go. Get out of here! You picked a really good one to come to. Get out of here! Jerk! How do you prepare for a day like today? Okay, first thing I really do is I start with my mood music. Dude, seriously... Come on! Yeeeeah! What are you doing? Come on, man! What, you're not liking that? No, I don't. I don't like your shitty music. Hey hey hey, what are you calling shitty music? That is art, brother. Look Tim, can you just help me out? Just a little bit for a second please? That's all I'm asking. Okay, okay, okay. Alright, usually, well we have a couple researchers put together a packet for us. Okay, this is constructive. Tell me about the packet. Well there's building blueprints, a history of the property, a backstory of some of the patients, I usually end up reading it the night before, but... How does that help you? Take the building we're going today, the orphanage, right? Aside from the 7 year old throat slasher, and other patient deaths, there was also supposed to be a couple of suicides among the nurses. Okay, so why the suicides? I don't know. Maybe we can find out. So you're like a detective. Hey man, being a ghost hunter is detective work. On your show, you have all these technical gadgets. I was just wondering are you acting with those, or do you actually know how to use them? Hey man, we got pretty deep into the history of hauntings, alright? We really learned and studied how to use this equipment properly. Problem is you realize most gadgets don't prove much even if you are... Damn it, shit! What the fuck?! Get the fuck out of the road! Ask for forgiveness! Get out of the road! Holy cow, this guy's crazy. That was nuts. You get that? That's not okay. Turn it off! Alright, okay. Here it is. That doesn't look very welcoming. Yeah, what a dump. He said we should meet him around back. Cool. Yo, keep antagonizing me, man. See what happens. Are they arguing? Aw, fuck. What's going on? Look, we got permits. The owners are proving... What's the problem? Sorry we're late, we got lost. I don't like you. What does that mean? I don't like you, bro. Hold on back here a second, let me see what's up, okay? I don't like your face bro, but you got to let us in. I don't even understand what the argument is. You're not hearing me. I've seen your bullshit show! Oh, bullshit show, really? Really? What's the problem? Is there a problem here? He doesn't want to let us in. Why not? We have a right to be here. Listen, I know you're trying to do your TV show, but I'm trying to help you. Why? By not letting us in? This shit is real! There's been incidents here. People have been hurt. I'm not letting you in, I didn't let the other guy in either. Who's the other guy? Old guy with the white hair. He means Bill! Look, what's your name? Hector. Hector Gonaldo. Look, I've been the caretaker here for 22 years. 22 years? You have to understand, I don't even go in there. It's not safe. Look, Hector, we really appreciate your concern, but we have permission from the owner and we have a job to do, so... You're not listening! You're not listening to me, okay? We're professionals, we do this all the time. Oh, you're professionals. Alright, and if it seems unsafe or bad we'll leave, but right now that's up to us. Comprende? Comprende. I said everything I have to say. Gringos, every time they come here they think they know everything. All yours. May the good Lord protect you. Hey look, Hector, I really appreciate it, thank you. Yeah, thank you, Hector. Could have saved us a half hour, but... You stop it! You stop it. If you need me, I'll be in my guard shack. That's a smart broom! Finally got through to him? The freakin' production office couldn't even locate the owners. Well we don't need them now. Let's do this! Yeah. Wow, this is gorgeous! When I grow up, I want to live in a place just like this. Yeah, polatial. Okay, so the dining area is over here to the right, you guys. Let's set up camp? Sounds good. Okay, well let's move in the gear. Yeah. Sounds good. Watch yourself, man. Hey Harold, you mind helping me with this? My back is hurting me today, man. Is that okay? Yeah, no problem. Yeah, actually my back is hurting too, so if you could just go ahead and grab all that stuff. It's the stuff right here, okay? Great. Come on man, make it snappy, let's do it. Hurry up! You got it. Alright, come on Tim and look at this floor plan, shall we? Chad, paper weight? Coming in. Thank you. Well right now, we're right here in the dining area. What was on the other side of those stairs as we came in? Oh, that had been the Director's office, but the owner said that that's locked off. They really haven't been able to get inside of it. Nor do they want to I guess. This room and the only working bathroom, to your left over there Tim, okay? Are the only two areas with stable lighting. Sorry guys. Hey, don't worry, I brought a flashlight, alright? Yeah, and Chad's camera's got night vision so you don't have to piss your pants. I got night vision too. White night vision actually. Good, thanks. Am I the only asshole without night vision? Roger, are you serious? Dude, you got a bag full of gadgets there, we spend a buttload of money on, alright? It's not night vision. Did you remember to bring your tampons, Rog? Alright, okay. What's the game plan? Well the building's three stories, and right now we're on the first. We can start there. Okay, cool. Who gives you these maps? Hey Harold, can you please? We're trying to get a job done, alright? Director's office is blocked, that leaves the kitchen, pantry and basement, yeah? Yeah, Mmm-hm. So we can start in the kitchen and then move our way up. I hear you, Chad. Sounds good to me. Fucking Bill! We don't know that it's Bill, this place is old as shit, it could be anything. Yeah. Well speaking of which, has anyone made contact with Bill? Yeah, I tried my Ouiji Board, but I had to leave a message, he didn't pick up. You know what? Shut up, Chad. I'm serious, my phone gets no reception in here. At all. Bill texted earlier, said he's upstairs. Really? Yeah, I can't get it either, guys. Must be the way this place is built. Does that mean there's no Wi-Fi? How am I going to look up Chad's mom on R/Space Dicks? Space Dicks. You're not going to have one if you keep talking like that. Okay guys, I'll go outside again and call Bill, it's not a big deal. No no, don't bother, he's probably just rigging stuff Hey guys, you know what time it is? Let me guess, it's mack on Julie time. No. Shooting time? No, it's picture time. Oh. We already get a team picture, come on. Not today, I look a mess. Seriously? You look beautiful. As a funeral, I'm serious. I'm not taking a picture. Harry, get in the photo! Really? Come on, Potter. Get in there. Alright, well give me a second. Get in here! Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on, Harold. Hold on, hold on, I'm coming. Julie, I'm good? Of course you look good. I wouldn't talk to you if you didn't. Alright, ready? One, two, three, small dick! Baby dicks! Let me see. It looks great, look. It looks great, yeah. You're a real Annie Leibovitz. Shut up. I love it. Okay, can you just try to say out of our way, alright? Stay close to Julie, she's a pro at it. Okay, copy that, no problem. Where are you going to do the introduction? Sleek kid, your friend. He's, we usually do the introduction and the haunting summary at the end so we sound informed about... About what's coming up, okay, what went down. Alright, okay, fun stuff first. Just don't say anything unless we ask or it's really important, okay? Yeah, got it. The main thing is we just get the footage and we get the hell out of here! Alright, let's hunt some ghosties! Woah, hold on, hold on. You guys hear that? Ugh, gross! Oooh, you pig! I hate when he does that. I don't want you to do that for the rest of the shoot. Alright, okay, okay, game faces on, let's go. Cup check! I saw that coming. Alright, let's go. Harold, what are you doing back here? Stick with me, I got you. Alright, I'm coming. No, he's not going to be in the way, okay? What am I going to do about him? Here we are in the Hollows Grove kitchen. At its peak there were at least ten staffers who... What? There's a black cat that just walked by. Did you miss the black cat? I totally missed the cat, where'd it come from? We don't know where the cat came from. Where did it go? How could we get it? Alright, fine, just start from the beginning. Yo, a black cat just walked by. Yes. Indoors. - Okay. - Okay. We'll start on this... Is it 10 or 12? It's 12. Okay. Good? Okay. Here we are in the... Hollows Grove kitchen. At its peak there were usually 12 staffers cooking for the children. The meals were anything but 5 star. Yes, true. History's said that the usual meal consisted of some kind of porridge and steamed veggies morning, noon and night. Except on special occasions where they would eat chicken. That's the stupidest line. Why am I saying that? It's a fact, I did the research. It's chicken and porridge and vegetables. I feel like an idiot. Well feel like an idiot and say the truth! Okay. Do it again. So difficult. Go. Except on special occasions where they would eat chicken. Sadly, there were no desserts. Okay, I'm not sensing anything right now. Yup, I think it's just your normal everyday kitchen. I guess the ghosts were not big fans of the meals either. Hey Chad? Are you seeing anything? No, nothing weird, but I am hearing some really strange noises from that cupboard. Strange noises? Where? That cupboard right there. Wow! Hey Roger, you want to check that out for us? Yes I do. Yes I do. Yes I do. Jesus Christ! Alright, put... no, no! Put it away! Stop, I don't... stop it! Put it back, dude. Okay, nothing out of the ordinary there. Yes, usually where there is food left out there are... critters. Hey, it looks like the kitchen is clear. You got that? I'm sorry, I had to, I'm sorry. That was amazing. That is not okay! That was so good. I don't want to be the bug guy anymore. Can use this for walk and talk, you know? Okay, you're the boss. Great idea, let's go. Julie, I want to hear you tell me that I'm no longer the bug guy. Okay, you won't be the bug guy, but you'll be the worm guy. Nice. That's a bug; a worm is a bug. Okay, whatever. Lighting department here. Okay, alright, so I'm rolling now and action. Oh yeah, this is me, sorry. As illness became rampant at Hollows Grove, death became a current affair. By 1925, Hollows Grove was averaging two deaths a day. Yes, from malnutrition and things, diseases, and things and... Do that again. No, I can fix that in post, that's fine. Diseases like tuberculosis. As the orphanage became overcrowded, it became hard to keep track of the orphans dying. Sometimes it would take staff members more than a day to figure out which orphans had actually passed on. Yes, and to get rid of the dead, the orphanage built a children's chute, a trash dump that got rid of the deceased tots into the basement. The... The basement was nicknamed The Buttefly Den because... could you keep that thing, it's right in my eyes, okay? Sorry. Try again. In the basement. Be nice, guys. Okay, alright, action. The basement was nicknamed The Butterfly Den so when the children asked where their now dead friends went, the staffers could say, "To fly with the butterflies." When in actuality, it was a large crematorium especially built. One staffer would say that it was an iron oven. It was so difficult to drain the smoke out of the crematorium, much of it leaked into the kitchen where we just were and some staff members wrote home to their family that the stench from the children's bodies were so powerful that they had to cover their faces with towels while they were cooking. The stench added to the flavoring of the food. Dude, a hair? Go! Next up, we'll go down to the basement. Dang, the door won't open. Uh, Julie! Look, it's supposed to be opened, so I don't know what's going on. I got it. Please. Great, great, great. Nope, that's locked tight. Only the Director's office is supposed to be closed. I don't know what's going on. Okay, we'll pry it open later, we got enough to do, let's just shoot out way back down and out. That's it for downstairs, shoot you on the way out. Yes. Okay. Let me just set up. I just want to make it clear that I am no longer the bug guy! Where are we next, Julie? The hallway, man. Thank you, hallway. Woah woah woah, hold on. What's up? The EMF reader's going nuts. Hold on. What was that? What is that? Hello... Anyone? Okay, it's died down. Looks like we have some ghosts here after all. Okay, this could be a long one. Cut guys, I've got to change tapes. You good? Yeah, it's got a few moments. Oh Billy, God bless you, buddy. You are awesome Billy, that rocked! Hey, hey, how about that one, Harry? It got my attention. It scared the piss out of me. You pissed? I pissed on myself! Okay guys. You ready? Just one second. Alright, tape's in. And we are rolling. So sometimes... Oh my God. Hold this, Julie. Yeah, yeah. Cut, what the hell is that? It's dead. Rog, did you do that? Did I put the EMF down and throw a fucking rabid cat at you? Chad? No, man. I own and love cats and I'm a member of PETA, this is bad. Got there somehow. It wasn't Julie or I, we were all behind you guys. Wait, I get it. It just jumped out scared. It jumped out and then suicided at mach speed into the wall? Maybe Bill set it up. Why would he do that? Because he's crazy, I don't know. Hold on, none of us threw a cat, okay? Look, maybe it was the ghost, okay? Maybe the cat ran through its other eight lives. Yeah, I left my "cat-apult" at home. Get it? Catapult? Okay, just forget it, let's go. Just please don't anybody throw anymore animals at me. That goes for you ghosts too. Catapult, really? I'll do the joking, okay? I'm sorry man, I just... Bill! What's wrong? Nothing man, I just thought I heard Bill wandering around up there I want to say hi to the old codger. Oh, okay. Where's everybody else? Right behind us. Timmy went to the shitter and Julie said she's going to keep Chad company while he gets some batteries for the camera. I bet Julie's "keeping Chad company." You okay? Yeah, why? Peachy. Just curious. Hey, why'd your EMF reader go so crazy back there? Ah, EMF readers look at electromagnetic fields, so faulty wiring could set it off, or... old place like this could really get the needle moving. Alright, you just seem worried a little. It's acting, my boy. No, I mean it was a little weird, I just didn't want to step into an electrical fire. Okay, gotcha. Where the hell is Bill? You ready? Yeah, let's go on. Yeah, Julie, lighting department. Harold, stand back from this, I might have to turn around. Okay, we are now heading... We are now heading... okay. We are now little white midgets. Shut up. We are now heading upstairs the Hollows Grove orphanage. The second floor was where they would keep many lifers, and children who were short on time. Since so many of the children were abused and molested, we can bet if their spirits still linger, they're not going to be happy. In fact, two nurses committed suicide on this floor in the 1940s. No one knows why exactly. Shirley Crane was one of these nurses. Ms. Crane jumped out of a window head first into the concrete outside. The second was Millie Farber. She tied herself up to a water pipe and jumped off the stool. Both of these incidents happened in room 205. It is said that in 1951, a janitor named Mr. Jessop saw a nurse he didn't recognize walking down the hallway with... laundry. She went into an empty room, and when Mr. Jessop went to follow and see who she was, she vanished. It also should be noted that a lot of people had heard strange noises on the second floor. Moans and whispers. Let's see what we find. Woah, look at the size of that hole. Let's not forget that when we head upstairs. Duly noted. Let's start with these... doors on the left and then see what we find? Sounds like a plan. That's just me. Seems like pretty poor conditions. These windows were opened approximately 10 hours a day, no matter what the weather, in the hopes of curing some of the children's illnesses. I guess that didn't work. Visiting doctors used to perform experimental treatments on the children. These treatments were painful and torturous. They usually didn't work. I think to be in here with all these sick people would be really rough. Yeah. Look at these! Looks like somebody was counting something. Maybe months, or years. Yeah, if they were sick, they might have liked to keep track of time. Hello? Hello, can you hear us? The hell? Flashlights on. I guess they heard us. Alright, let's... let's go down the hall. Look at that wheelchair. This is interesting. If you look at the bed sizes. These two beds look like they were for older children. That one looks like it's for a toddler. Yeah, I wonder if they made them all room together back then. That makes sense because maybe they thought, the staff thought that some of the older kids would look after the younger. Or maybe they didn't care. It was said that when tuberculosis and other diseases became rampant, this orphanage was flooded with children of all ages. That doll just move on its own? Let's check it out. This is amazing that this is still here. It still sorta works. Lookie here. Betsy Lynn, 9 years old... "I miss my Mom and Dad." That is so sad. I can't believe that people just abandon their kids here. Yeah, people were pretty worried back then about getting ill. I guess having a child with disability or illness was considered a social stigma. Still, I think that's pretty awful because I would like to think that I would not abandon my kid like that. Yeah. I'm sure poverty played a big part as well. Because this place became who's who of the unwanted. Let's leave you here with little Betsy. Woah, did you hear that?! Yup. Wait, that sounds... That sounds like children laughing. Yeah. I have my recorder. Here. On me. Woah, do you see this? Yup. What happened to the ball? The ball is gone. Guys, the wheelchair moved. Roger, leave the recorder on, let's try thermal. Chad, did you get inserts of that? Mmmhm, I'm over it. Get some stills too. Tell me when you're ready, okay? I'm rolling. Can you... see me? Yeah, you look colorful. See if you can see anything else. Hello. If there is anyone here, can you show yourself? Hello?! Spirits? What the hell? What? I don't know, let me see. No, it's nothing now. I thought I saw something. No, I'll just check playback on the laptop. What is going on up there? Sounds like skipping and someone talking to themselves. Let's keep going. Harry, my bag. What is that smell? It sounds like something miserable died in here. Yeah, like yesterday. See if you can get some paint samples over there. Yeah, good idea. Alright, I'm going to get some stills too. Hey Julie, can you grab this? This is where we make the big bucks. I bet. Julie, how we doing on the time? We're doing good. Just keep getting everything in film. Woah! You guys, you got to come feel this. What do you got? Come feel this! Oh shit, that's a real cold spot. Get the thermometer, quick. Yup, on it. Okay, let's see. Oh wow, in this corner we got 37 degrees. Oh my God. Outside of that corner we got... 57. Wow, that's got to be some kind of record. We felt cold spots before, but a difference of 20 degrees is unheard of. I'm not seeing any air vents, no cracks, nothing. Oh my God. Hey Harold, the two of you guys got to put yours hands in there. No, no! I'll hold this. Oh my God, it's freezing! That is so cold. Get everything on film, come on. Chad, give the thermometer to Roger and frame us up, okay? Stand by. I want to tell the audience what we're feeling. And rolling. We are now standing in the corner of the third room we have entered on the second floor. We measured it, and there is a 20 degree difference. This corners measures 37 degrees... Woah, what... what is that? Woah, where'd that go? What? Hey Harold! Harold... Hey, sorry about that. We are trying to do a show over here. No, I know I know, I'm sorry. Did you get it? I mean... yeah. Alright, yeah, let's, we got enough of this, it smells like ass, let's keep moving on. Let's go. It's horrible in here. That sounds like Bill. Sure does. I know we should check these other rooms out, but I am dying to see that room that's closed that I saw earlier. What's behind door number 3? Oh hey, let's check it out. What? What... God damn it, the door's, the door won't... What, Julie! Look, I don't know. Hold on, let me try. Okay, they told me that everything left... They lied to you! I know! You know what? Forget it. If the orphanage here doesn't want us to check it out, then forget it! Hey Tim, Tim, we'll come back to it we still got to go to the basement too. Tim, you had your shot man, let me go, I want to go upstairs, let's go upstairs. Hey, isn't that where they kept little Lilah? Little Lilah, 7 year old with the knife fetish. Come on, let's go, please. Okay, fine, let's check it out. Mumbling? Shh. Rog, you getting this? Yes, shh. It's gone. Okay, cool. Cool, let's check it out later. We'll go upstairs, okay? Wait, Tim, Tim, Tim stop! God... Harold, God damn it, I told you... I saw that was going to fall. It's okay. Yo, that's real glass. That could have cut us really badly. Hey Harold, fudge, sorry man, thanks. Sorry for the yelling. No, it's all good. Did Bill set that up? Because that's a really stupid gag. What the fuck? Hey Bill! Bill, that was really dumb, man. Where the hell are you? One of us could have gotten hurt! He's probably asleep somewhere. Nope, that doesn't sound like Bill. Look guys, we're not going to find him just standing here. This place is really starting to wear me down, so... let's just... Okay, yeah, let's keep moving. Let's go up, hey Chad... Careful of the glass. Okay, camera on me, Chad. Ready. Ready? Yup. We are now about ready to go to the upper level of the orphanage. It has been said that Lilah Calford lived up here. She was a 7 year old with a personality disorder. Oh, shit. Camera just died. Are you serious? Fuck, I got to go downstairs and grab new batteries. Why wouldn't you just go get batteries and keep them with you? They didn't charge well last night, man! What do you want me to do? Wonderful. It's not my fault! It's perfect! Sue me. Okay, let's just take a break and go downstairs and reconvene later, okay? Just take a break. Okay. Yo, that cold spot was nuts. Yeah, I'm wondering if that's got something to do with the insulation or something. Hey, answer me this. Was it you that stunk up that room? I'm just asking. Shut up. You okay? Yeah, it's just, this place is pretty gross. I've got a really bad vibe here, and my stomach is kicking. I just want to go, just get this over with. Hey, Harold, sorry again, man. Okay? It's alright man, I just, I didn't want you head to get cracked open, you know? Okay. What was that broken mirror all about? Dude, we don't know that it was Bill. That could have really been anything in the house. Where is he? Woah, woah, woah! Chad! Chad! Oh my God, oh! Chad, are you okay? Chad?! Hey hey hey! Hey, woah, Chad? Chad, you okay? Yeah, what happened? Is he alright? Don't fell down the stairs buddy, okay? Don't move. It felt like somebody kicked me in the shins and pushed me away. Honey, are you okay? Yeah. No he's not, he just fell down the stairs! Ah, damn it, the camera's busted! Don't worry about the camera, man. We're worried about you, okay? I'll just try to go outside and call an ambulance. No no no, Julie, I'll be fine. Hey, are you sure? That was a pretty big fall, dude. Guys, just help me up. You sure? Careful, careful, careful. Be careful, be careful! That's good. Okay, let's, we're going to take you into the dining room and get where there's some light, okay? Yeah, I just need to lay down for 5 minutes. Yeah, that's going on our gag reel! Aw man, I'm glad you're okay, man. Yeah man, just don't post this on YouTube, okay? How you feeling? I'm a little sore and banged up, but I'll be okay. I think I twisted my ankle though. You want to go home? Get out of here? No, I just want to rest for a little bit. Hey, goofballs, you got to come see this. Remember with the infrared when I paused for a second? Can you see? Yeah. This is what stopped me. What is that? Wait, let me just play it slower. That is crazy. Woah, I mean that looks like it's smiling. Yeah, I'm done with this place. I'm done. You think that could be gas or something? I don't know, but I know it's good TV. True. Listen, I transferred this out, I have to listen to the sound. Do it, Boy Wonder. So you, I take it you're done shooting for today? Well yeah, camera's busted and I'm just going to take a rest. What about us? What do you, think you'll be okay in a little bit? Well you got a star cameraman filming us right now. Yeah. You sure? Yeah, I mean all you two d-bags need is a monkey to film you and he's a perfect monkey. You cool with that? Are you kidding me? Hell yeah, man! I mean I'd love to. I'm already shooting you guys anyways, right? Jules, what do you think? Well from the production side, of course! We'll put him on payroll. Sweet! This day is really starting to shape up. Alright, watch it. Hey Chad, sorry man. Look, I know this is a one off, alright? I just, I want you to feel better. Yeah, thanks. Just make sure when you get down there, shoot everything no matter what. Okay, yeah, definitely. Everything. Hey, you guys got to listen to this. Sounds like girls laughing. That's easy, Bill could have set that up. I got the wrong ones, just, remember the mumbling? Yeah. Still sounds like mumbling to me. Just wait... You never get out. What is that? Yeah, I heard that. The end with the mumbling. Did it say alfalfa sprout? No, listen again, here. You never get out. Sounds like, "You never... get out." That's what I heard. Oh hell no! I'm done with this place, I'm done! It still sounds like alfalfa sprout to me. That's because you are an idiot. I feel you, Julie. Guys, the lights seem to be back on again. It's a good time to finish up then. Yeah. Get while the getting's good, that's what Granny used to say. Really? Nope. You cool? I'll be fine. I'm not going anywhere. Yeah, and I'll stay here with Chad. I'll make he doesn't need anything. Fine. Harold, follow us. Aye aye, Captain. Hey, Harold. Yeah? Just make sure you get everything no matter what. Alright, you got it. Thanks, Harold. Maybe we got enough B camera already, we could just shoot. No, dude, we drove all the way out here let's just get our footage because it's not going to be the greatest... Woah, woah, seriously? What? Fucking... the wheelchair's gone. Dude, if Bill is fucking with us, I'm going to be pissed. Chad almost died. The least he could do is come down and help us. Yeah, no joke. Let's just make this quick, yeah? We go upstairs, we shoot our way up, we come back down and out, yeah? Alright. We are now hearing children's music. I'm recording sound. It is coming from upstairs. Oh dude, it's room 205. The nurses. Yeah, we got to grab that. Just make it quick. Yeah. Hey... Want to frame us up? Here we are in room 205. This is the room where both nurses, Shirley and Millie, committed suicide. Both women ended their lives in this very room. Millie hung herself, and Shirley jumped out of that window. Do you just think it's weird that this is the only room that the windows aren't boarded up in? Yeah, it's ironic. You'd think after what happened with Shirley this would be the first window covered up. Other than that, room looks better than the others. Maybe... maybe they kept it clean out of respect for the dead. It's just sad. I mean it's sad to think that these two ladies who tried to help these poor children both ended their lives in this room. Well, the room checks out exactly how it looks. It's clean. I guess the two women are resting peacefully. Good? Yup, okay, cool. Let's just, next one upstairs? Yeah. Upstairs, okay. You want to... Yeah, commercial, right. Coming up, the upstairs. Alright. The third floor is where many strange apparitions have occured. Shit! Look at this! This baby still works. Really? Can it shoot? Like a kaleidoscope. The lens is cracked, see? Yeah, but don't worry about it. Just another piece of crap we can write off. How you doing? My back is a little stiff and my leg hurts, but other than that I'm super. If you need something, just let me know okay? Yeah? How about a massage? In the crotch area? You're such a jerk! I just want to get out of here! This place sucks! Well the boys should be done soon and then we'll ditch this dump. Yeah. What is that? Pipes, maybe? How you doing, Jules? Maybe we grab some food on the way back, what do you think? Julie? You there? Great, flashlight just died. Hey Tim, I got night vision on this camera. Should I switch it on? Do you want to just shoot in the dark, or... Yeah, I mean shoot his night vision, Chad's hurt, let's just get what we get and get out of here. Just turn it on. Okay. You good? Pretty good. Let's go. Hey, you getting his good side? Yeah, the red button's for record, right? Oh, I thought it was for self destruct. Hey, watch out for this glass. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is that? What? Oh shit, guys. What is that? What? What do you see? Tim, you don't see that? Tim, how do you not see that? Tim, shut the door! The Door? How the fuck do you not see that?! Tim, shut the door, Tim! Please just shut the door! Okay, okay! God damn it! Oh my God! What is it? Woah woah woah! That was crazy. What was it? Harold? Harold, what was it? I don't know. It looked like a bunch of kids, but weird and all wrong. And what, they're gone? They just vanished? What were they doing? I don't know. Bill could not have set that up. Did you get it on camera? Yeah, I think so. I mean I'd have to check playback, but yeah. What are you doing? This door, that was closed. It's open. How the hell did that open? Maybe that's not such a good idea. You know, Harold's right. Let's just check it out, okay? We have to. Get out, get out, get out! What happened? Who tied you up, Bill? There's a devil! The devil! That's not funny. Who tied you up, Bill?! There are kids in the hallway! God damn it! Holy shit. Okay man, you got me, alright? Oh my God! Okay, Bill, come on! You got me, you got me, you got me. Just shut up! Bill? Come on guys, let's get out of here. Shit! It's not real! It's not real! It's not real! We got to go! Listen to me, we have to go! That's Julie, that's Julie! Julie! Julie! Guys, we've got to find them and get out of here! Julie! Chad! Noooo! Fuck! What do you mean, it's locked?! I don't fucking know, and it's fucked! How are we going to get out of here? Fuck! Okay okay, just calm down. Fuck! They're missing. They're not there. They're not in the dining room. Fuck. You always wanted proof. What? It's all a big fucking joke to you, right? Well what is this?! Now is not the time. Is this not real? What are you talking about? You got us stuck here! You got us stuck here! How is this my fault?! It's all your fault! You're always the leader! You're always the fucking leader! What?! It's got everything to do with you! Guys, come on! Fuck you. Fucking cunt stick fucking is that what you want?! What did we ever do to you, you assholes?! Julie, what's going on? Julie, what's that for? Julie, wait, Julie, hang on! Wait, Julie, you don't want to go up there. Julie! Julie, wait! Julie! Julie! Julie? Julie! What happened? Dude, she just fell, man! How? How?! She just fell out of the window! It was like she was pulled. Julie... Julie... Hey, woah, woah, hey, shh! We're going to be next, okay? No, listen to me, listen to me. Tim's right. Downstairs is blocked, okay? Why did she jump, man? Downstairs is blocked, we need to go upstairs we're going to maybe get to the roof or something. Come on, let's go, let hustle! Julie! Roger, come on, let's go! Julie! Come on, guys. Come on. Roger, we've got to go! Roger! Come on. Hurry up! Let's hustle, come on! Alright, okay, let's check these rooms and see if any of them have a way out of here. Or at least roof access. Dude, what about Chad? If we're lucky he found a way out. Shit, nothing! God, Harold keep watch! What am I looking for, invisible beings?! Anything, just keep watch! What was that? Okay, let's try these other rooms. Not another boarded up window! There's got to be a way out! Tim, over here! You guys hearing this? There's a door here! I need something Are you guys seriously not hearing this? Who gives a shit?! Hector. The Groundskeeper. He... hung himself. No no no no. He didn't hang himself. Let's go, let's go! Roger, stop! This is stupid. Guys, stop! Roger, stop! What?! This is idiotic. Even if we do somehow break through those bars, how are we going to get down three flights of stairs, man? Think! What if we just went to the roof? The roof? So what, we can get pushed off like Julie or tripped like Chad? He didn't fall. What are we going to do then? Do you have a better plan? Yeah, okay? How about we go downstairs and try to go through the front door or one of the windows down there, okay? It's better than being on the third floor. Fuck me, he's right. Never get out, never get out, Tim! Tiiiiim! Let's go! There's no sense talking about it, let's go. You okay? Yeah. Alright, let's go man, come on. Wait, where's Roger? I don't know. Wait, Roger? Roger? Are you here? Roger! What are we going to do? I don't know, we can't leave him! Tim, help me! Wait. Tim, please! Do you hear that? Yeah, we've got to go back! Roger! Oh shit! Go get your stuff, get out of here! What, what, what, what, what was that? Tim, I'm sorry, but he's gone. There's nothing we can do, we got to go. Tim! Go, you got to go! We got to go, Tim!

So that is the last of the footage taken. The bodies of the SPIT crew were found by my agents at Hollows Grove. Only the producer, Julie Mercaid survived. Sadly, she's in a deep coma and we don't know if she's going to come to. Much of what we've seen defies logic. Any new thoughts would be welcomed. Our field agents were able to capture some evidence from the scene. Can you move in a little closer? ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Hey honey, been thinking of you all day.
