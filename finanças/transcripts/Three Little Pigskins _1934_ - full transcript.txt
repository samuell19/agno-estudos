[♪] Ah, if them Tigers of mine don't knock off them Cubs of Beasley's, heh, I'll take a running jump in the lake. Right. If your team loses, you drop 50,000 bucks. There won't be anything left to do but jump in the lake. [RINGS] Hello? Yeah. Oh. All right. Oh... Well, what's the matter? Matter? Plenty. Here we get the big game coming up Saturday, and three of my best backs go out and get plastered and land in a ditch with a car on top of 'em. Why don't you go up to Boulder Dam College and get those three famous horsemen that have been running wild all year? Them guys is amateurs. We're professionals. No matter how much I pay them, they ain't gonna give up their amateur status for us. Oh, what's amateur status? Oh, it's a big political party, toots. Yeah? Are--? Are we going to it? Relax. We're all going. Aw, come on, Joe. If you want to save that 50 grand of yours, we'd better go out and dig up some football players. Yeah, I guess you're right. Come on, fellas. Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy. Pay me a little attention, will you? What do you want? Let me have a dime for a hamburger. Go on, you can get a hamburger for a nickel anyplace. I gotta have the other nickel for a bicarbonate of soda. Down here I get funny little pains... Hiya, pal. Get lost. I'm in a hurry. I know, but you know-- Get away. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [PUNCH] Say, uh, how are you fixed for money? Okay, thank you. Yeah. I was worried about you. Stick 'em up. I haven't got a dime. It's a depression with me.

[WHISTLING] Got anything? Nah. Oh, laying down, eh? Did you get anything? No. Oh, slacker. Wait a minute! Did you get anything? Yeah, did ya? No, does it make any difference? [BOTH MUTTERING] Spread out. I'll take him. Hey, got a dime for a sandwich, buddy? What do you mean, a dime? You just asked me for a dime down the street there. Check him, boys. W-- Say, would a dollar apiece influence you fellas any? Is it honest work? Does it make any difference? No. No. Just thought we'd ask, you know? Okay, follow me. Get it up, get it up, get it up. You walk from here to that corner. Okay. Turn to your right three blocks. Okay. Then meet us up on the hill in an hour. Okay. If you get there first, put a chalk mark. Okay. Suppose you get there first? Then I'll rub it out. Okay. You walk from here to that red light. Meet us up on the hill in an hour. Get going! I wonder where that apple-head is. I don't know. He's been gone about five hours, now, and I told him to meet us here on the hill in an hour. Here he is. Oh, I'll take care of him. Well? How are ya? Explain yourself. Where ya been? You told me to go up to the barbershop to the red light, didn't ya? And? Well, that red light was a bus going to Boston. Oh! Oh, my hat! It's all right, madam. You got nothing to worry about. Come on, boys. On it. LARRY: Okay. I'll take the brake off. Hiya. Here's your hat, madam. Oh, well-- Why, you're the three horsemen.
