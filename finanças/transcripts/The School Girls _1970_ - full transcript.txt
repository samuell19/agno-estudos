That's us: today's youth. Many think we're strange, they don't much like us. Why? Because we're skeptical... Have our own music... because we want a new morality without hypocrisy. That's us - today's girls. We're curious and honest about ourselves... while you, the adults, have been lying too much. Your sausage is burnt. It's my sausage. I can burn it as often as I want. Like our history teacher: black on the outside and brown inside. - What else can you expect? - You'd be surprised. Think of what you can do with sausages. You eat them! Yes, and you can eat them too. This film is based on the sexual reports by Günther Hunold. We've added to them by conducting our own surveys. We have thus created an effective and spontaneous documentary. It shows our youth how they really are. It shows that our girls see sexuality as an existential part of their self. This film will open many parents' eyes... because it shows what many parents don't think is possible. Schoolgirl Report: What Parents Don't Think Is Possible... Based on the book by Günther Hunold... With an epilog by Kurt Seelmann... Former director, City Youth Office of Munich... Starring Many anonymous youths and parents... And as reporter: Written by... Music by... Photography... Design... Editor and Assistant Director... Directed by... Come along, ladies. Mind your step. - Be careful. - I'll remember that. Good day, my name is Hoffmann. I'll be your guide. - And here are the kids. - Remarkable. -I could fancy him. - Him? You must be crazy. Listen up. Quiet, please. Mr. Hoffmann has been kind enough... to agree to show you around the power plant. Please pay attention to the physics involved. I'll come back to this in class. - Good day, ladies. - Good day. If there's anything you don't understand, please ask. Are you married, Mr. Hoffmann? Looking at you, ladies, I'm tempted to say... “Unfortunately, I am.” Okay, let's go. You'll be issued a protective hat. Not everything that comes from above is good. This way. Make sure no one is getting out of line. Quiet. To the right, please. The conversion of energy... - Have you seen Renate? - She must be over there somewhere. No, she isn't. Where is Renate? Where is Renate? Who's there? - Renate? What do you want? - Can't you guess? - Please- - Please stay down there. Where can she be? She's not a little girl. She'll turn up. Renate! Why would you take up with that bus driver... a man you don't know at all? I've known him for six months. Renate, do you love him? When two want to sleep with each other... it doesn't mean it's the love of your life. Child, you know what you're saying? I'm not a child, Mrs. Vogt. You should know that by now. I'm 18 and live in the 20th century. What I did, I did voluntarily. Don't be insolent, Renate. First of all, this embarrassment occurred... on an official school trip. And secondly, our school bears the responsibility for this. - As an educator- - Don't mention that word. Everyone thinks he needs to educate others. You and your colleagues cram your teachings down my throat. What I do privately is my business. You're an ingrate. The principal and I are only trying to help you. How can you help me if you don't understand me? You talk about love, while I speak about sex. You're an intelligent student. If you use your intelligence to oppose order and propriety... then you're in the wrong place. Worse, you're a danger to the other students. - Can I leave? -I can't keep you. But you'll have to face the consequences. She must be expelled. Members of the parents' council... you'll understand that as principal of this school... I'm responsible for its reputation. I have no other choice than to seek her expulsion. Nevertheless... I'd like to discuss this case with you... before it goes through the official channels. Expulsion is harsh punishment. Remember that she is an excellent student. And she's about to graduate. - She can attend another school. - How can that work? The other school will know and reject her application. - A boarding school, perhaps? - Her parents may not have the money. She should have thought of that first. Let's not get sentimental. As parents, we can't allow such filth to rub off on our daughters. Hear, hear! This is not getting us anywhere. In my view, Renate just had bad luck. The bad luck of being discovered by an overzealous teacher. That's the only difference between her and the other students. I beg your pardon. Please let me explain. Doctor Bernauer is a psychologist specializing in adolescence. - He might, perhaps- - Psychology, my ass. Spanking them, that's the best psychology. - Absolutely! - A mother doesn't need psycho babble. I don't think you're right. Today's youth are more independent sexually than you think. We might not like it... but our kids don't just talk about sex... they practice sex. Our sexual ethics are outdated. The fact that a majority of the public... is unwilling to abandon principles that have no objective basis... doesn't change it either. Particularly, the state, churches and schools. Their ethics don't match the findings of modern research. I myself have conducted a series of surveys. Let me give some examples. What do you think of ads like these? I think that's none of your business. But these ads are to make you think. - Did you make it? - No. Then, why ask? Are you trying to pick me up? That's an old trick. - So, no answer? - No answer. See, Mr. Reitmeier, the priest. I have asked around. I can't believe someone like that would become a priest. I'm going to upset his hormone levels. How? I'll confess and make not only his hair stand up. What a shame that such a man is not available biologically. - Stay. I'll change. - What for? Stupid, he deserves some fun too. Well, then don't wear your bra. - Is anyone coming? - No. Mother wants me to confess regularly. I'll do just that. If 1 wore that at home, my father would Kill me. Come. Kneel. Confession is at 5:00. He'll be here shortly. Don't be silly. My last confession was a week ago. But I have sinned again. Well? - Ask me. - How did you sin? I've committed fornication. - Fornication? With whom? - With a man, of course. What sort of man? About 40, he's somewhat older. He's married. In what way? I kissed him. On his belly. First his belly, and his thing got all big and hard. And so kissed that too. Were you naked? Of course, Father, stark naked. He stroked my breasts. He shoved his hand between my legs. Then, he gave it to me. Eight times in a row. From behind, and three times from the front. And every single day. So many times each time? Sure, I went back to him all the time. - Is that all? - Isn’t it enough? No, you haven't confessed to breaking the eleventh commandment. The eleventh? Does it exist? If not, it would have to be created just for you. What do you mean? Thou shalt not brag. You don't expect me to continue with this confession, do you? - Why? - Because you lied. I cannot give you absolution. This is not a place for bad jokes. Come back when you're sincere. My apologies, Father. - Come, let's go. - What's up? Damn it, come! I've told you this story to show you... that young girls may do things totally unimaginable to adults. But don't conclude that these are signs of moral decay. For Heike, her actions are simply pranks... that make her popular among her friends. There's no reason to think they will affect her future. I had to repeat one year once if you're interested. My father is department head in a food company... and my mother is a housewife. I have no siblings. Hello? Ah, it's you, Micky. Yes, Susie just got home. Susie, telephone! - Who is it? - Micky. Hello? Hi. Saturday? Who else is coming? Peter too? He can go and take a hike. Michi and Kuchie? That'll be swell. No, this afternoon I can't. I'm being tutored. No, I really can't. Bye. Say hi to everybody. What did Micky want? We want to go out on Saturday. - That's out of the question. - But the others can go. This is only about you. If you fail your courses again, you'll be expelled from school. - But I'm working hard. - Not enough. Girls your age have to focus on school. I have to see my math tutor. That's what I mean. We should deduct that from your allowance. Leave some cherries for your father. You never think of the money your laziness costs us. - And come straight home. - Yeah, yeah. Through allocation of X to X to the power of alpha... with alpha constant... a function is defined known as a power function. - What's that? - Mathematics. - And what does it mean? - Don't tempt me. - To do what? - Spank you. - Coward. - Shut up. What are you doing? I just wanted to know what it feels like. - And do you know now? - Not quite. Tell me, Gunther... have you ever been involved with women? - What's it to you? - A lot. Yes, sure, of course. - So you know how to do it? - Know what? You know, with courtship and all. Okay, and if so, then what? Listen, Lolita, you're barking up the wrong tree. Fornication with dependent minors- Why? I don't depend on you. Great idea to move class out here. I'm not sure anymore it was a good idea. Flirting, kissing, hugging and petting... are quite natural in post-puberty... Petting involves intimate physical contact.. That doesn't end in intercourse. But all else is allowed. This has less to do with love than with curiosity. No. Please, no. Stop. Our interviewer Friedrich Von Thun... has heard a lot about petting in Munich's streets. Listen to it yourself Excuse me. Can you tell me what petting is? - Of course. - Well, what is it? Putting your opponent on the mat and finishing him off. - Have you been involved in petting? - Yes, I think when I was 14. At the English Garden, and my boyfriend was 21. He'd touch me... and we'd both reach a climax. If we’d been inside, I think, we could have gone further. - How old are you now? -16. - Do you have a steady boyfriend? - Yes. - No. - Why not? - Don't feel like it. - Did you have a steady boyfriend? No. What's with those personal questions? I don't like this. Do you think that it's the man that must initiate sex? No, not necessarily. How do you seduce your boyfriend? That's too personal. I don't want to answer that. That's difficult. It depends on the situation. - Do you have a steady boyfriend? - No. Why not? I'd rather be independent. Do you think that a girl should remain a virgin until she's married? That depends. But I think you can't generalize. If you're excited and don't have a man, what do you do then? Well, what do you do? That's great, no? - You can wear this. - It's moth-eaten. - No, it's great. I'd take it. - Then why don't you? - My dad would kill me. - Mine doesn't mind. - You think I should? - Yes. - Can I try it on? - Yes, of course. - Would you like to try one on too? - No, no money. All right. So does it fit? Yes. Man, this is great. If Otto sees me like this, he'll make his moves. - Otto and you are going steady? - Yes, he's 27. Beard and a car. - You don't have a boyfriend? - No. I see. Lack of opportunity. But don't wait too long. Otherwise, you'll get pimples. - What am I to do? - Find yourself a stud. Or do you have to ask your dad's permission? Stop playing with your food, Achim. Your mother puts good and nutritious food on the table. How did you do in Latin? -I got a D. - That's sad. - Why? A D is adequate. - Great. If adequate is all you aim for, you won't go far in life. Why? You don't know that. Bismarck failed twice. And Einstein was a retard until the age of 10. Stop making these ridiculous statements. You know what I mean. You wouldn't have any food if I hadn't worked hard all my life. Civil-servant food. That's great. Achim says something, but I get slapped. Shut your trap. You deserved it. - You laughed. - I'm not allowed to laugh? - No! - But Egon. Thank you. I've lost my appetite. The mouth on today's youth. I should have been so impertinent. My father would have killed me. - Shit. - Achim. - And I wanted to go out tonight. - Why should you be better off? - May I be excused? - Yes. At least one who's allowed to do things. Father and mother are living in a bubble. They don't know me at all. When will they realize I am not a child anymore? I'm not allowed to do anything. Everything is off-limits for me. If they could, they'd cut off my breasts. They'd keep me in the sandbox until I was 27. Don't ever do anything this filthy again! Or do you want to be sick for the rest of your life? Don't you want a decent and proper man? What were you thinking? What do you think your father will do if I tell him? Who taught you that? Mrs. Holm makes every possible mistake in this situation. It's not masturbation that's making Elisabeth sick... but her mother's backward ways of raising her children. Masturbation, which is even tacitly accepted by the church... is a natural valve for letting off steam in adolescent development. If you're excited and don't have a man, what do you? Then, I'll satisfy myself. Why not? Can I ask you a few questions? What do you think of masturbation? Well, I don't know. Everyone can do what they want. Do you do it? Sometimes. How old were you when you started? Twenty. Twenty years old. - Why did you start? -I saw it in a movie. - Was it- - Yes, I think so. - How often do you do it? - That depends. - Do you have a steady boyfriend? - Not at this time. - Do you masturbate if you have one? - Yes. - If you have a steady boyfriend? - What? - Do you masturbate then as well? - Why not? - How many times a week? - Don't know. If I feel like it. - Can I ask you a question? - No. - What do you think of masturbation? - Nothing. - Can I ask you something? - Yes. - Do you masturbate? - Yes. - Since when? - Since I was 5 or 6. - How did you find out? -I slid down the banister... and it felt good. When did you start masturbating? After I got married. - What? - After I got married, when I was 24. How many times a week? Rarely, because I'm married. - Do you feel guilty about it? - Not, not at all. Why should I? Can I ask you something? What do you think of masturbation? My goodness. Why not? - How did you learn it? - You find out for yourself. - Do you feel guilty about it? - No. Masturbation? What do you think? Sure, why not. You shouldn't do it alone. You must have a partner. If someone doesn't have a choice, why shouldn't they? - How did you learn it? - You don't learn it. You either know or you don't. You're mother and daughter. What do you think of masturbation? I don't think it's so wrong. At what age did you start? Not in my youth. It didn't exist then. I was 10. My girlfriend showed me, and I did it too. I think it's good for your body. - Did you feel guilty? - No. Not at all. - How many times a week? - Three or four times. - Do you have a boyfriend? - Yes. - And you still do it? - Yes, I prefer to do it myself. I'm Michelle and 18 years old. I'm in 11th grade now. - Do you have specific problems? - Not that I know of. Not at school or at home. - Do you want to get married? - Because I'm babysitting here? I'm doing this for my sister. That little one, that's hers. Yes, I'd like to get married. But only after school. When I'm 21 or 23. And I want to have children. - Two or four. - Why not three? I read once that three fight more than two or four. - And until then? - I'm on the pill. - You get it like that? - Yes, from my sister's doctor. Do you want to talk about your sex life? Scientifically, yes. Go ahead. I can always say no later. How old were you when you lost your virginity? Thirteen. - Were you seduced? - No. I wanted to know. It was hard getting the boy to do it. He was 18, and I was curious. And it was fun. From that day on, I've always had sex. I met my current boyfriend at a party. That was five months ago. Since then, I haven't fucked everyone in sight. His name is Michael. He's 22. Wants to work in a bookstore. You don't feel like changing partners all the time anymore? No, not at all. But I have urges. I need it a few times a week. If he satisfies me, of course, I'll be faithful to him. Tell me, you don't think I'm a mental case, do you? No, don't worry. - Does sex require love? - No. - It can be fun without love? - Yes. - Could you work as a prostitute? - Yes. - Yes? Thank you. - But not below 500 marks. - Does sex require love? - Yes, that's the only way. At least, that's my view. Essentially, no, but I think there's a big difference... between a sexual relationship with love and without. - Do you- - But it's possible without love. - Could you work as a prostitute? - No. - Are there borderline situations? - Yes, certainly. At what age should young girls be allowed to have sex? That depends on how mature she is, from 16 or 17. - At what age did you first have sex? -16. Would you have sex for money? No, but generally, anyone could. What happens if a girl is physically mature... but cannot deal with her sexual desires mentally? A girl like that will often make herself and others unhappy. This case occurred in a major German city. - What are you moping about? - Thinking of Mrs. Blitzke. That old lesbo. The assignments she gives! - What was it this time? - Joan's moral conflict. Stupid! - What Joan? - Joan of Arc. By Schiller. I'm sure I failed the composition. I'm finished if I get an F. But Mrs. Blitzke can't stand me anyway. - Those would be right for us. - Since when are you into kids? They're hard work. They need to be broken in by others first. Asshole! There he is again! He would be worth a sin! I'd love to take a ride on him. Oh, him. He's probably into women with a fat bank account. The jury's still out on whether he's into women. You want to put him to the test? - How? - Silly. Ever heard of striptease? He's back. - He's passing by here. Shall we? - Only if you're all in. - Sure. - Well, then let's go. Hey, you can't do that. - What? - Going topless. How else are we going to get a tan? Do it at home. Here it's forbidden. - Who says so? - The regulations. Kids, don't be difficult, or I'll have to kick you out. You could do that? I wouldn't like it, but the rules are the rules. - Personally, I couldn't care less. - Really? Be reasonable and put your tops back on. I haven't seen anything. When I come back, I don't want to see that. Understood? - I'll show him. - You won't. Silly, he's shitting his pants because of the law. I'll manage. Give me a hairpin. - What are you up to? - You'll see. Well, go ahead. - What's wrong? - You got a Band-Aid or something? - Did you cut yourself? - Broken glass. It's everywhere. You should look out for that, not topless girls. Who knows what can happen? I could get sepsis. Where? Here. Are you going to let me bleed? Just a minute. I'll get you something. You do that. I can't reach. You got some iodine? Who knows what can happen? - Ouch! - It won't take long. - And what about damages? - Damages? - Sure, you're liable. - You're nuts. How about if you let my friends and me back in tonight? After closing, we'd like to have the pool all to ourselves. I can't do that. It's not allowed. Come on. We could look for broken glass together. Out of the question. I'll be. You're all dressed up. Nice, eh? We're off to a special party. Don't let anyone see you. My job's on the line. - What's your name? - Theo. And you? Margit, Karin, and I'm Claudia. - How old are you? - 44, You're kidding me. - Together. You do the math. - That doesn't leave much. Are you sure? Swim as much as you want, but be quiet. You have some towels? We couldn't bring ours to this party. I can't get it off. He's looking at us. I wonder how long he can keep his cool. - Hush, he's coming. - What's with you? Why aren't you undressing? I changed my mind. See you. She's so middle-class. Don't bother showing your face. Are you crazy? If someone sees you- That wasn't the deal. Get out now. Stay in there. I'll put the towels down, and you're gone in five minutes. Or I'll call the police. Get the police, then, Theo. Where's the police? At least be quiet. Hey, what are you doing? Is yours really that small or is the water just cold? Claudia, with a pool attendant! Why? Why? I don't know myself. I'm scared. Will I have a baby now? A baby at 15? You're a child yourself. We have to see a doctor now. Please, Mom, if I'm pregnant, let him take it out of me. That swine. He's responsible. He'll have to pay for this. What he's done to you! I have to tell your father. No, please, don't tell him. We can't keep it from him. The man must be punished. You're not 16 yet. The man is a criminal. What about the other girl? Did he do it to her too? No, Mom, only me. He didn't want her. He did her only orally. What an irresponsible swine. Such a bastard. - Why you? -I don't know, Mom. He should be executed. In the name of the people, the accused, Theodor Bandis... a pool attendant, born in Salzburg in 1955... is hereby sentenced to serve in jail for three months. His sentence shall be suspended on probation. The verdict is in, handed down by a judge... who answers to his conscience only. Still, he was bound by laws written in and for a time... when young girls were considered dependent.. And were betrothed to be married by their parents. Do you agree that a man who sleeps with a girl 15 or 16 years old... should be found guilty by a court? Yes, because at 15, she's still too young. It's hard to set a limit, but 15 is too young. I know myself. You change your outlook at 15 and again at 17. Depends. If the girl is fine with it, I think, then the law is rubbish. Well, if she was willing... he should not be sent to jail. It takes two to tango. -I agree with this. - And you? I think the girl should share part of the blame... because a lot depends on her. It depends on whether she was willing or not. If she wanted to sleep with him, the man is not responsible. It also depends on why he slept with the girl. If he only did it for fun... or if she acted in a way... that the man ended up sleeping with her... or if she concealed her real age from him. I don't agree, because she is not completely without blame. If she lets it happen, the man is not the only one to blame. Hannelore and I have been bragging about sex and stuff. We told the boys how experienced we were, and they got all hot. But we don't know anything. Hopefully, they're just as scared. Come on, Hannelore. Are you having second thoughts? Don't be stupid. Why would you think that? Well, then hurry up. Those boys are hot. They won't wait for us. - They're actually coming. - So what? - Where are you going? -I remembered my feet are dirty- They don't care about your feet. You just have to be ready. We don't get naked, only the chicks will, understood? But we can still get away. I've never done it before. Me neither, but that's no reason to put your tail between your legs. I once read that if you're nervous, it might not work. That'd be bad. Nonsense. We just have to be tough. They're really hot chicks. What we lack in experience, they have too much of. Let's hope so. N-N-Nice view, eh? So, are we going to do it? But not here. So what's your plan? Don't leave me alone. What now? Somebody has to make a move. Come on, babe. Take it off, or at least your panties. Then no one can say we stripped them. The way you think! If you really don't want- Damn it, what are we going to do now? - You’re in? - We're already here. What's your name? Hannelore. Do you like my name? Not as much as your tits. How am I supposed to have an orgasm with all this? Idiot! - How old were you the first time? -18. - How old was he? -22. At what age should a young girl... be allowed to have sex? It depends on the girl. If there's a man you really like, would you simply sleep with him? Yes. If I really like him. - Even if you don't love him? - Do you mean his looks? I mean with a good-looking man. - If my feelings don't say no, why not? - Why not? - Are you on the pill? - Yes. How do you remember to take it? I just do. I'm used to it now. Thank you. - Do you have a steady boyfriend? - Yes. - How old is he? - He is 21. Does he live up to your ideals? No, not really. What is your ideal man, then? Physically or emotionally? - You see a difference? - Yes, I do. Let's start with the physical. Physical. My type? He's got black hair... a dark man and well-built. My boyfriend is blond and not so tall. - And emotionally? - He must be caring. He must not be a snob like most of today's guys. - Can he be a black man? - Sure, why not? What do you think of factors like money and virility? Money and virility? I don't know. Everybody must have money. Virility? I think everyone must have that too, no? When do you first sleep with a man? Isn't that a bit too intimate? Do you think a girl must be a virgin until she's married? No. - Why not? - Why should she wait so long? - When did you first have sex? - At 16 and a half. Do you think a girl must be a virgin until she's married? No, today I think that's not the case anymore. - When did you first have sex? -I think I was 16. I think a girl should gain sexual experience before marriage. I think it'd be good for her. Sexuality is something essential... and should be handled before marriage. If she's a virgin when she gets married, I think... she'll be very unhappy later and pick up men. She should be experienced. Otherwise, she wouldn't know about married life and what's expected. - How old are you? -16. When do you think a girl should be allowed to have sex? It depends on the girl and how mature she is. But not necessarily under 18. If you like a man, would you simply sleep with him? Why not? We wouldn't have to talk a lot and stuff. - When did you last have sex? - Three weeks ago. If there's no man, do you do it yourself? No. Why has it been so long since the last time? Well, it's not so easy. I can't answer that. - Or maybe I can. - Okay. I got the clap. Thank you. Our daughters today are aware of emancipation... the equality of men and women. Probably one of the most crucial trends of our century. Men and women are to be equal in their abilities, performance and demands. But this idea of equality can also lead to excesses... such as sexual aggressiveness on the part of women. This creates situations unimaginable in the past. We're done for today. You can go home now. - Bye! - See you! Marlene, what are you doing here? Don't you want to go home? I want to exercise a bit. You said it was good for the chest muscles. It also helps your tummy if you do it right. Then be a darling and show me what I'm doing wrong. Don't stiffen your back. And keep your legs together. This is hard and requires a lot of strength. It's easier for men to keep their legs together. Yes, that's true. Don't do that. Go home. Marlene, what are you doing? What do you want? You should know that by now. Well, Dieter, are you scared? - May I ask you a question? - Yes. - What is your dream man? -I don't have a dream man. - Do you have a steady boyfriend? - Yes. - How old is he? -19. Would you sleep with an older man? Depends on how old he is. - Would you sleep with your teacher? - No, absolutely not. Why not if I like him? Would you sleep with your teacher? - No. - Have sex with him? No. - Do you have a steady boyfriend? - Yes. - Does he live up to your ideal? - So far, yes, he does. What about money and virility? Gosh, money. Having money is nice. As for virility, I haven't met any impotent men, I don't know. Those are not really important. Would you jump into bed with a man you like? No, not immediately. Do you think sex can only work in connection with love? Actually, yes. Love should play a role. - But it's not necessary, right? - No, it's not a must. - Must the man make the first move? - No, I don't think so. She can't be passive and must be as active as the man. - How would you move first? - I have an idea. My God, that depends. You can't just define it like that. Do you think that the man should make the first move? Not necessarily. The woman can make the first move too. Could you see yourself make the first move? I would let him come out of his shell first. - How old are you? - You know how old I am. - Just making sure you do. - Are you starting this again? I haven't stopped yet. Okay, as you wish. I'm 18 years and two months old. I'm a Protestant and in 12th grade. I have an A in music and won't sleep with you. Happy now? - That was clear enough. - Well, good. Not good. I won't be teased by you anymore. Tease you? Are you crazy? Because I won't sleep with you? Exactly. We've known each other long enough. - Three weeks. - That's an eternity. For you, maybe. And I don't want to be expelled from school like Renate. Shut up. I've had it. I don't want to hear about it anymore. - Then I'll go. - So what? What I want doesn't matter anyway. - I'll take care of that. -I won't be blackmailed. You frustrated bitch. You've seen it. What do you think? If you want to keep the boy, you have no other choice. I was 18 when it happened, in my boyfriend's apartment. It was no accident, I knew what I was doing. But it was painful for me and I didn't enjoy it much. That quickly changed and I regret not having started sooner. I was 15 and a half. I was with my last petting partner at the English Garden. We both wanted it and had thought it through. It was extremely painful, but I didn't bleed. I didn't have an orgasm, because I was afraid of getting caught. Afterwards, I was quite happy. And you think it's correct to have sex at 15 and a half? Sure. - How old are you now? - Seventeen. - Will you come with me? - You got something to drink? - Yes, half a bottle of whiskey. - All right, then. I don't know what gets into some girls. I was pleasantly surprised. I hardly felt any pain, and we did it four times the first night. It was beautiful. My friend was 26 and very experienced. He undressed me and softened me up with his hand. I'd been petting before... so my hymen must have been ripped already. I don't know, but it was great. I was 17 and a half then. Do you still think it was the right age? Yes. - Were you in love? - No. Love played no role. It was just sex. Come on, what's on your mind? I don't know what to do. Axel wants to do it. - You don't? - Sure, but- No “buts.” It's no biggie. - I'm scared. - You must be joking. It's going to be painful, and I'm not on the pill. Well, he has to be careful, then, if he's honorable. About the pain, it's not so bad. True, the first time isn't as good for us as for them. But the sooner you start, the better. Be happy to get rid of your hymen. This is not the Middle Ages when they weighed it in gold. Later you'll regret not doing it any sooner. I don't even know if Axel is the right one. The right one? That's not important. There'll be enough time for love later. First, you have to learn how to do it. But it's the high point in a woman’s life and without love- Where did you hear this rubbish? That's a fairy-tale story. Love doesn't lead to sex, but sex to love. It's like soccer. Pelé trains all the time, but the championship is every four years. You talk as if you had all the experience in the world. Enough to see clearly. For me, it started with me almost getting raped. Back in Frankfurt before we moved here. I knew my stuff, because I had had a boyfriend. He taught me a few things, petting and stuff. How old were you then? Barely 15. I still remember it. It was a really hot day, and I wanted to visit a girlfriend. My parents were always at ease when I visited her. They liked her home and family. “If she's with them, she's in good hands,” they'd say. What a joke! So I go there, but she wasn't there, only her father. He invited me in and said he'd get his daughter. But then he attacked me. If he hadn't been such a fool, I might have done it with him. A mature man is supposed to be ideal for your first time. But this guy- - Did he rape you? - No. - Did you report the swine? - No, because of my friend. It was not her fault. Besides, I would have had to go through it again with the cops. I could have ended up being a mental case. If your parents ask about your dress, tell them you fought with my daughter. - That must have been a shock. - No, I'm not some delicate flower. You know that these things happen. But it was a weird feeling. And it took its toll: I got one F after another in school. Good thing we left Frankfurt soon after. In Frankfurt, my parents had me attend ballet school. It was all about their fixed idea of grace. In Munich, I continued the hopping around. That's where I met Ingrid. You know, in a strange place, you look for a friend. But I had had a different idea of this friendship. - With girls? - Won't hurt you to find out. It wasn't a big deal and only happened one time. But it was good, because I finally wanted to have real sex. - How old were you? - 16, sort of. His name was Bert. He was 17. He lived with his grandma in a little cottage. He'd never have asked me. He'd never been with a girl. I felt like a vixen. We'd planned it all. Bert brought some red wine to get some courage. We also had a record player. We wanted to undress each other, always taking turns. Each one a piece. And then it happened. - Did it hurt? - It was bearable. But it was no picnic. Don't expect too much. It was unsatisfying and bitter. Not the way I'd imagined. It was a flop. I went home to distract myself but it didn't help. My short encounter with Bert had left me restless. I was waiting for something, my first orgasm. That's not very encouraging. It was difficult for me in the beginning. That happens. - Do you still see the boy- - No. I didn't care for him. - And now? - I'm seeing Robbie, who's 28. - Your big love? - Maybe. - How often do you see him? - Sometimes two or three days in a row... sometimes not for weeks. He travels a lot. - Your parents know about him? - Like I would tell them! They still pretend I was delivered by the stork. They think I'm the woman without a bottom part. There's Robbie. See you soon. And take care of Romeo. - Good day! - Lilo! Come in. - Is Mr. Eriksen in? - No, he's out. Don't be sad. He'll be back. He's just mailing a letter. I'm going to the opera tonight... and he'll be home. May I wait? I need to talk to him. We've had a fight. -I know that. - Did he say why? No, and it's not the business of an old woman like me. Of course, you can wait here. Make yourself at home. Today's youth need something else. I have to dash. You know? The best part is always the prelude. And remember: no female visitors after 10:00. I'm telling you because I won't be back until 11:30. - Give my best to him. - Thanks, I'll tell him. - You? What a surprise? - You think? Come on. You're sweet. You're sweet. That's all right, Doctor, but you can't generalize. Are you saying that all our young are morally corrupt? I didn't say corrupt. Sexuality is not something evil or bad. It's a natural urge that we all have. You don't say that your statements apply to all girls, do you? -I agree. - Of course, not all. But that's beside the point. We need to recognize that girls have sex sooner today. And we're not entitled to condemn their sex lives. Or to punish them for it. Honestly, I think we should think about what he said. And where would that lead us? Maybe an ethical understanding that's not hypocritical like ours. Today school girls have sexual fantasies and act on them. Let's be honest and look at things without hypocrisy and blinkers. I really don't know how to approach my daughter anymore. Be subtle and tolerant. And forget the idea that your daughter is a virgin. Easy for you to say, but can I do the right thing? It's not easy for parents to give good advice... but at least let's try not to give them bad advice. Very enlightening. Let's come back to the case in point, Renate Wolf. Since Dr. Bernauer has taken charge of educating your daughters... I think it's best if I leave. Good-bye. - How much longer will they be? - Careful, the old hag's coming. School has been out for along time. What are you doing here? - We're waiting for our parents. - When will they be finished? If had a say, this farce would have been over long ago. Good evening, Mrs. Vogt. Have you heard anything yet? No, but looking at her face, I'm getting a bad feeling. What a silly cow. - Will your dad pull it off? -I hope so. We have to come to an end. Let's take a vote. I want her to stay. I'm against it. I'm getting sick thinking my daughter sits next to that brat. - What if your daughter is next? - She would never do that. Are you sure? I'll follow Mrs. Vogt's example and leave. One less vote against you. You should think about sexual prejudice... and why it lingers on in German families. Let's vote. Who agrees that she should stay? I still have concerns, but I don't want to cast the first stone. I don't want to be a monster, so I'll vote in favor as well. Thank you for your decision, which I support wholeheartedly. I'm sure the teachers' council will share your view. Thank you. I still have some fundamental doubts. Why didn't you discuss them? - Who wants to be old-fashioned? - That's true! - How did it go, Dad? - All clear. Did you hear? - Was it bad? - No one likes hearing the truth. No one likes hearing the truth. But truth is what we want.
