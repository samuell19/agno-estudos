Subtitles by explosiveskull Hi, there. - Is the test subject prepared? - Yes, Doctor. - Is the serum ready? - Ready. De-evolution Test 103. I have modified the serum slightly in hopes of awakening its dinosaur DNA. Begin low-level radiation. Shut it down. Keep recording! Keep recording! Get the tranquilizer gun! Hit it again! I thought that you were done for. Yes. Did you hear that roar? I'm getting so very close. Just missing a little... something. Hmm. Take tissue samples of every organ. Cryo-freeze the body afterwards, I may need some more samples later. Mm-hm. And for example, some people incorrectly believe that the T-Rex and the saber-toothed tiger were alive during the same era. We have Hollywood to thank for that. Dinosaurs roamed the Earth between 65 and 248 million years ago, until mass extinction wiped them all out. Many scientists believe that an asteroid slammed into the Earth causing earthquakes, volcanoes, forest fires, and tsunamis all around the world. Yes? You have a question? You said they all became extinct? That is correct. But aren't there animals alive today who were relatives of the large dinosaurs? Birds, for example? Great question. And once again, you are correct. Many current species alive today, including birds, snakes, and frogs are distant relatives to the dinosaur, just to name a few. Is it possible then that a large dinosaur like this could be out there somewhere, just waiting to be rediscovered? Dork. There he goes again. "Ooh, dinosaurs." Don't listen to him. He wishes he could have your brains. Okay, everyone, just... Manners. That would be the find of the century, but, sadly, no. The biggest relatives alive today to the dinosaur are the alligators and the crocodiles. Now, if you all will follow me this way, we're going to look at the theropods. The theropods are two-legged predators... Pentaceratops were herbivores, and we all know - herbivores don't eat any... - Meat! He looks like he hasn't eaten anything in at least 65 million years. Okay, that's... - Where's Chris? - I thought he was right here. He's probably off in his own world or something. You know how much strange and unusual things make him lose time. We need to find him before he gets into trouble. And if you'll come with me this way, I'll show you a species that was discovered not too far from here. - Jeez! You scared me. - We've been looking for you. Where did everybody go? The group moved on a while ago. Lucky for you, Mr. Brown hasn't noticed yet. We better catch up. I don't know about you two, but I don't want detention again. No kidding. My parents will kill me. And that's why archaeologists take an immense amount of time and care when removing artifacts from where they're located. It's very interesting. Wouldn't you agree, Chris? Uh, yes, Mr. Brown. Very fascinating. Yes, she is. It is. And if you'll follow me this way, I'll show you another exhibit. Let's go! I gotta be on time. Addie, Cole, Karlin. Uh... Single file, please! Just... Just get on. Karlin... You know what, here is your cell phone. Do not make me take it away from you again. Good, you found your backpack. And Alexander found his shoes. Why'd you take your shoes off, anyway? Okay! We got 18. Here we go... Oh! And John, and Carrie, and Chris. Good of you not to wander off this time. - Yes, sir, Mr. Brown. - All right. That's everybody. Okay. All right. Let me sit down, let me sit down. Oh! Blast it all! What am I doing wrong? The alligator has been processed and stored. Here's the sample you requested. Thank you. If we don't show some significant results soon, I will lose my funding. I mean, come on, there's not even any visible mitochondrial structure in the last sample you gave me. I'm working with a bunch of amateur nitwits here! Anything else, Doctor? No, no, no, you're free to go. Oh! One more thing. If you put that mayonnaise stuff instead of mustard on my next sandwich... you're fired. I thought we were dead for sure. Yeah. Chris, my mom will think you're a bad influence. Sorry, guys. It's just, there's so much that's unknown in the universe, let alone the world. It's kind of mind-boggling. I love you for your uniqueness, but... You better keep your mind on your school studies for now. Hey, come on. I got homework. You two go ahead. - What? - I'll see you tomorrow. I want to check this place out. Don't be too long. You don't want your mom to send out the army looking for you. Sorry. You startled me. Toy store is down the street. I was never much into toys, unless it was to take them apart and see how they worked. Ah. A young mind seeking knowledge. The world is full of knowledge. And magic. Okay. So what can I do for you, young sir? What are you looking for today? I'm always on the lookout for something different, unusual. Unusual? Most boys your age find girls to be unusual. Mmm. This is a mummified cat. Cats were so important to Egyptian culture that many of them were mummified after death. I studied Egypt. In 1888, a farmer found a tomb containing over 80,000 mummified cats. The object inside of this is over 100 million years old. Oh. It's a spider. I have one of these with a mosquito in it. These aren't just paperweights! They are echoes of the past, living and breathing creatures that walked the Earth millennia before you were born! They're right in front of you, trying to tell you their story. They did their talking years ago. All you have to do is listen. I guess I have nothing that you want. - But... - You're not ready for what I have. I'm ready for anything. What exactly are you looking for? When I said that I wanted something unusual, I meant... I want something that I've never seen before. I want something that nobody's ever seen before. Hmm. I know you're in here somewhere. Where are you? Ah! Wrong box. Ah. There you are. It's time, my friend. Here it is. This is what you need. What's so special about this? It's just a box. And it doesn't even open. You have to earn it. Once you've proven that you're worthy, then and only then, will you be able to open it. Hmm. How much do you want for it? I don't want money for it. I only require that you promise to take great care of it. Can you do that? Yes. I promise. Thank you. I promise. How was the museum? It was okay. Chris, this room is the pits! You know what they say, smart people are messy. Who said that? Other smart people. Well, I'm not their mother, so I don't care what they do. Thanks, Mom. I can get the rest. Dinner will be ready shortly. I'll be down soon. An egg? When hatching a chicken egg, the egg always must be kept warm. The hen only leaves the egg to get food or water. Chris, dinner's ready! Coming! - Whoa. Slow down, champ. - Sorry. Who wants dessert? - Yes, please. - None for me, thank you. What? When do you pass on apple pie? I have a lot of homework, Mom. Homework? Never seen a kid so excited to do homework. Must get that from your side of family. Mmm... I'll have to warm you up again soon. I hope you're worth it. No! Stop! What are you doing? No! Oh, my gosh. Whoa. - Is everything okay up there? - Yeah! I just read something very... interesting. I won't hurt you, little guy. Come on. You don't have to be afraid. Come out. I'm not a bad guy. I promised to take care of you. My name is Chris. You are amazing. John and Carrie are going to freak out when they see you. Don't eat my homework! I need this! Still hungry, huh? I'll be right back. Changed your mind about dessert? Yeah. Just taking a break from my homework. What was that? Uh, I must have left my... - window open. - Hey! Yeah? Aren't you forgetting something? Oh, thanks. Whoa. Have you gotten bigger? I brought you some of my mom's apple pie. What should I call you? You need a name. Albert. Albert it is. Hey! Where are you going? I can see you. What's going on in there? Nothing. I was just reading. Well, finish up. It's time to go to bed. You have school in the morning. Okay, Mom. I will. Good night. That's my mom. She takes care of me, and... I'll take care of you. Albert, we better settle down. We wouldn't want Mom to come back in here and see you. She wouldn't understand. Here. Good night, Albert. - Have a good day. - Okay, Mom. Bye. Whoa! Whoa! Dude, stop. Shh. You'll have to be quiet. I don't want anyone to take you away. Hope you didn't get home late again. No. Did you finish the math homework? I don't think I did it right. Uh... Whoa. What is that thing? Shh. It's a dinosaur. It's so cute! Does it have a name? What's its name? Can I pet it? His name is Albert. And yes, you can pet him. Aw. Where did he come from? The shop I went into after school. The owner gave me a box and told me to take care of it. All I know is that there was an egg in it and it hatched. He seems to be growing quickly, too. He just gave you a dinosaur? Yeah. He won't hurt you. You need to tell your mom and dad. No way. They wouldn't understand. Albert chose me. He's my responsibility. So what are you going to do? I'm going back to the shop to talk to the old man who gave him to me. What about school? I'm not going today. You're going to get in trouble. Just tell them I'm sick or something! I don't get it. Well, hello there. May I help you? Um, yes. I was in here yesterday. I need to talk to the old man who gave me the box. An old man? Honey, I don't know what you're talking about. Are you sure you're in the right place? Yes! Uh, well... This is my shop and I'm the only one who works here. But there was an old man. I stood right here. There! That picture, that's him! I need to talk to him. It's important. Oh, honey. This is my husband. We opened this shop together. But he died. Uh, more than five years ago. What? But I was with him here yesterday. Oh, my darling. I think you must have dreamt it. I'm sorry for bothering you. Oh, honey, it's all right. Carrie is right. I might be losing my mind. Don't worry, Albert. I know where to go. Oh, you can't just go inside. Oh, I have to keep track of all the students Mr. Brown is bringing through here, in the museum, on field trips this week. Uh, did you say something? Sorry. Did you say Mr. Brown was here? Oh, they've already gone in. Last one off the bus? You better catch up. - Okay. Thank you. - Yeah. We can thank Hollywood for that. Dinosaurs roamed the Earth between 65 and 248 million years ago until mass extinction wiped them all out. Many scientists believe... Enjoy. Nice day, Dr. Jost. Are there school children here today? I saw a bus outside. Yes, the local science teacher is bringing them every day this week. Oh, goodie for me. I hear that Dr. Roberts has a new specimen for you. I think you'll really like it. I hope so. I only collect the best. He's waiting in his office for you. I hope it jumps up and bites you. Oh. Hello! And welcome. Albert! Get back here! Hey, look how real this one looks. Whoa, no kidding! - Take my picture. - Yeah! Excuse us. Say "Triceratops." Triceratops. What was that? Morning, Mr. Jost. Ms. Carter. I did not spend 14 years at some of the most prestigious universities in Europe, earning three doctorate degrees, making me singularly the most highly qualified scientist in my field, simply for you to call me "Mister". It's Dr. Jost. Do you understand, Ms. Carter? Yes. Sorry, Doctor. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. - Dr. Jost. - Dr. Roberts. How's your research going? Oh, fine, fine. I think I'm on the verge of a significant breakthrough. Wonderful, wonderful. Well, I hope we have something that can aid in your research. We really appreciate you buying our extra specimens. The museum can always use the additional money. Well I... I do what I can. So what do you have for me today? I have a few items you might be interested in. I already have multiples of each of these. These are just gift store trinkets. These will not aid in my research. What I'm looking for is a frozen dinosaur or an un-petrified egg. Something from which I can get some good tissue samples or some viable DNA. If that's ever found, it would be worth a small fortune. And I'm willing to pay it. It's that important to me. You've never really explained what you're doing at your lab. I've never really explained to anyone what I'm doing in my lab. It's top secret. And besides, most people aren't intelligent enough to understand it. You'll let me in on it someday, I hope? Once I do my breakthrough, it will be in all the scientific journals. There will be a media frenzy. Guess I'll just have to wait till then. You won't be disappointed. Well, good day, Dr. Roberts. Call me when you have something... useful. Albert, get back here. Albert. Look at these. Pretty scary, huh? Mommy, look. A real dinosaur. Uh-huh. Bye-bye, dinosaur! Bye-bye, dinosaur. Come on. Let's go get some lunch. Excuse me. Hey! You're not supposed to be in here. Is that a new robotic dinosaur? I just work here. Come on, Albert. It's okay. Come on. Albert! No! All right, everyone... Please, stop, stop, stop. Please, stop right out here. Hey, hey, hey! Okay, okay. Let me get right here in front. Okay, all eyes on me! Now we've seen some interesting things inside. Now, we'll explore the gardens outside. I will remind you all while we're out here, no running, no pushing, no shoving. Please do not... act like that guy. Do not forget who you are. All right? We'll meet for lunch in 30 minutes. Does everyone have a sack lunch? Somebody have an extra? Somebody left mine on bus. I got you. You're safe. Hello. What's in that bag? Nothing. Oh, just let me take a little look. Have Site B up and running. I may be onto something. Man, Albert. With all this running around, you must be hungry. I know I am. Hold on. I'll get us something to eat. I know, Albert. I don't know what to feed you. I don't know what kind of dinosaur you are. Nah. Ew. Stop it! Come back here, boy. I'm sorry. He's never acted like this before. I... I don't know what's got into him. That's okay. Let's try this, and... maybe some meat. Just in case. - Is this your dog? - Yeah, this is Zeus. Aw. - Come here, boy. - What a good boy. Such a good boy. - Such a good boy. - He's a good boy. What is that? Hey! - Oh, man! - Oh, gosh. I'm sorry. Are you okay? No, don't touch it. Just be glad it wasn't the salsa. - Dude, I'm really in a rush. - Dude, I used to skate. What kind of wheels are those? - You got somewhere to be? - Yeah! - Get 'em! - Thanks. Albert! Albert! 911, what's your emergency? I need someone here, now! What is your current location? 519 Elm Street. Hurry! It's a monster! Oh, no! All right, now, sir, you know it's illegal to fire a gun in town, right? That thing tried to kill me! It's dangerous. All right. Well, just relax, okay? We're gonna take it down to the station. We'll find out what it is and where it came from, okay? Just take it easy. What the heck do you think this thing is? I don't know. Looks like a giant lizard to me. A giant lizard? Yeah. It probably escaped from the zoo. I bet they don't even know it's gone. I'm gonna call Dr. Jost. He's the big reptile expert around here. I'll ask him if it's poisonous. Dr. Jost? Captain Williams. Yeah, we found this thing I think you might be interested in. A lizard. Really? Are you positive? No! No, no, I'm sure it's harmless. Yes, we're on our way. I knew I saw something at the museum. You two, get the van. Follow me. And let me do the talking. Albert! No! Hey, kid. Shouldn't you be in school right now? Yeah, well... My dad... I'm... I'm here for a school research project. Okay. You okay, buddy? Uh. yeah. I just need to sit down. All right. You take care. Good luck on your project. Breaks my heart to see a creature such as that in a cage. Sorry, what? The big fella. He should not be in a cage. Have we met before? - Do I know you? - I don't believe so. I can't imagine how our paths would have crossed. I like to keep to myself. Blend in. You just look like a man I've recently met. Um, never mind. I'm just confused right now. Ah. That's all right. I get that way myself sometimes. The... big fella in there, he's a friend of yours? Yeah. He ran away and got caught. The city is no place for someone like that. He needs space. You should take him outta here. I imagine he would love to roam free in the woods, or... Or run in open fields where there's no people. Where he could be safe. He needs to be free. - That's it! - Yeah. - Thanks. - So, what are you gonna do now? I don't know. Has that thing always been that huge? I've never seen anything like it. When's Dr. Jost getting here? I don't know. I just want it out of here. Yeah. Creeps me out. Who's Dr. Jost? My card. Come on, come on, come on. I'm a busy man. - How can I help you, sir? - I can't believe it! Yeah. That's one big lizard. Yes. Lizard. My name is Dr. Jost. I specialize in rare creatures such as these. I was contacted by your superior, Captain Williams, to come and retrieve our missing lizard. Don't do anything stupid. Just wait. Dr. Jost, I am so glad to see you. I can't wait to get this thing out of here. Captain Williams, thank you for your cooperation. Albert. It'll be okay. It's a good thing you called me. What do you mean? A creature like this, anything could happen. Thank you, Captain. Let me know if you need anything else. Okay, let's go. What do I do? I'm going to help him. We need to get your friend back, kid. How? I know where they're taking him. Seriously? Mmm. I won't let you down, Albert. So is everything up and running? Good. Tell everyone I have a big surprise for them when we arrive. Yes. Oh, and I need extra guards patrolling the area. Thank you. Doctor, are you worried about that kid snooping around? I'm not worried about anything. We may never have another chance like this. Besides... What can he do? He doesn't know where we're going or how to get there. What can he do? - I don't know. Tell someone... - Who's he going to tell? His parents? The police? No one's going to believe there's a living, breathing dinosaur around. There's nothing he can do to me now. You hear me? You're on your own now. You belong to me. And with your help, I shall make many, many more. You're going to make me very wealthy and famous, my prehistoric friend. Shame you won't be alive to see it. - Where are they taking him? - Out, into the forest. They have a facility there and a lab. In the forest? How are we going to get all the way out there? I can't ride my board that far. It will take till tomorrow. By then it would be too late. Don't worry. We'll get you there. - Come on. - But how? I'll show you. Don't worry! Is this your house? What... Hey! Wait! Whoa! What do you think? This is awesome! As you can see, I like to recycle. Is this thing street-legal? Of course it is. It's got everything required to be on the street. It's got... headlights and blinkers and... Taillights, and a license plate, and a horn. We are good to go. What about a license to drive? What? The flash startled me. Ah. Here. Put this on and get in. Let's go. I hope this time works better than last time. This time? What happened last time? Let's just say this thing used to look a little nicer than it does now. - This is so cool! - It is! How do you know where you're going? Ah. Whoa! Keep your eyes on the road. I can't see. I... I can't see with it like that. Hold on! Let me see... Now what? We'll do it the old-fashioned way. We'll navigate by the stars and the moon! It's daytime! Everybody's a critic. Chris? I must be working too hard. I'm seeing things. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. - That was my dad! - That's nice. No! I'll be grounded until I'm 30 if he saw me. You should stay home with your parents as long as you can, that's what I always say. Next stop, Albert! Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please? Gather 'round, gather 'round. I have made the discovery of a lifetime. Instead of studying history, we are making it. Now, every good team needs a great leader. In this case... Me. Today, every scientist will know my name and give the acknowledgment and recognition that I... that we deserve. Without further ado, I give you... a living dinosaur. Well, yes, yes, yes. I know. It's very impressive. But come on, we have important research to do! Which way now? You said you knew where they were taking Albert. This way. Hold on. Uh-huh. Slow down! Good idea! - That was close! - Too close! I got good news and bad news. Uh-huh. The good news is we're making really good time! - What's the bad news? - We don't have any brakes! What? Don't you have an emergency brake? Yeah, it's here somewhere. - Like a lever? - No, it's more like an anchor. Look! Here it is! Great! Hold on! You didn't tie it down? I knew I forgot something! If I only had my tools, I could fix the brakes! Oh! Ah! Here! Thank you. I'll be right back. What? John and Carrie will never believe this! I think that went pretty well... considering it's only the second time I've ever driven. What? - Who are those people? - Shh. - How are we going to get in? - Leave it to me. I still have a few tricks up my sleeve. How will I know when to go? You'll know. Stay here. You're not supposed to be here. I didn't disappear, did I? Hey, hey, fellas. Take it easy. Come on. What on Earth? Careful with the clothing here. - We can't have this! - You're right. It took me years to refine this look. Get rid of him. - But... - Go on. Back to work. Oh, no. Albert's gotta be here somewhere. Albert. I'm glad to see you, too. We gotta get you out of here. Shh. Not so loud. They might hear you. Hey, you aren't going anywhere. What the... That's how it's done. Come on, boy, don't just stand there! Albert's locked up. Time for an old-school getaway. I don't know how you got away, but your luck just ran out. Lock everyone up! You can't do that! I'm just a kid! I make the rules here. Do as I say, lock them up! Run! There's no need to feel threatened. There's no reason to be scared of a bum, a kid and his pet. No! No, no, no! Get back here, you cowards! Get after them! We can't let them get away! This way. - I think we can lose them in here. - Okay. That way. This way. Albert! Albert! Albert! Albert. Okay, let's split up. You two, that way. You, with me. Hey, hey. It's okay, it's okay. Come on. Follow me. Come on. Don't know. Come on out, kid! We know you're here somewhere. Come on out and you won't get hurt, I promise. All we want is the dinosaur. Hey. Think about it, kid. You could be rich. You and your family will never have to worry about money again. We'll take good care of Albert. I promise. What do you say, kid? I'll take good care of Albert. Just as soon as I take care of you. - They're catching up. - Over here. Shh. I thought I heard something. Shh. I think they're gone. They went that way. Then let's go that way. Stop, stop, stop. We're going the wrong way. Which way? We need to split up. - We'll head off this way. - That's not what I mean. You and I need to go back to the city. Albert needs to go that way. No, I'm not letting him go. Chris, Dr. Jost will find him if he stays with you. You understand that, don't you? - He's my responsibility. - You're right. But the only way to keep him safe is to let him go. You're right. I don't want to see you get hurt. You have to go. Go. Go to the forest. Go! Go! I don't want to see you anymore. Albert. I love you. Take care. He'll be all right. Let's go! - I think we lost them. - Now what? Now we get you home. Told you we'd get you. Hold him. And don't let him get away this time. You think you can do that? - Where is Albert? - Leave us alone. - Let us go! - Tired of messing with you, kid. - Where's the dinosaur? - Stop it! - Gone! Albert's gone! - Where is he? Tell me! Take your hands off him! Where is he? Somewhere safe. Doctor! We need to leave. This is not over! Come on. Follow my lead. You two need help? No. No, sir. I think we're good now. We were just taking a stroll through the forest. Yeah, my... uncle and I just got a little turned around. You never know what you might see out here. - You need a ride? - No. No. No, I wouldn't want to stink up the inside of your car. You don't smell that bad. I wasn't talking about me. Well, where are y'all headed? The city. Well, just keep going, and this road will take you downtown. - Okay. Thank you. - Thanks. You did good. - Thanks for the help. - I was just tagging along. Will I ever see him again? Maybe. Probably. I'm sure you will. You run on now. I'm just going to sit here for a while. Besides... you got school tomorrow, remember? Oh, yeah. School. I almost forgot. Thanks again for the help. Chris! Where have you been all day? - Where's Albert? - Where is the dinosaur? - What happened? - Albert's gone. Gone? Where is he? - He had to leave. - What do you mean, he had to leave? My new friend right here... helped me get Albert to safety. - Dude, there's no one there. - He was right here. I... I never got his name. Sorry. We didn't see anyone. Meet me at my house. I'll catch up with you and tell you everything. I'll be right behind. - Don't take too long. - I won't. You okay? Yeah. Perfect. You two go ahead. See you later. Can't wait to hear all about it. Be safe, Albert. Subtitles by explosiveskull
