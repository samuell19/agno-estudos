Hey honey, can you call me later? I can't talk right now. The meeting just went on and on. I have to stay for one more night. I'll call you soon, OK? Honey, I said I'd call you soon. Sorry, I can't talk here. Like I said, I'm staying for the night. I'll take the morning flight. You can't fly to Paris whenever. That's just how it is. I don't know. I'm tired. I just want to finish this job. Honey, listen. I can't hear you. Hello? No, I'm not hanging up. Hello'! Miss. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. They want us to base the design on the new photo. No, I don't think they'll decide otherwise. I'm sorry, Robert. What was that? What did you say? Yes, the photographer did a brilliant job. I have the files now. I can't send them all the Wi-Fi doesn't work here. Yes, I know. I'll send them in the morning. When I get home. Or should I stop by the office and leave them for you? Yes, on my way from the airport. I apologise for my friend's behaviour. Please accept my apology in form of this glass of wine. I would love the company of an interesting French lady. - Cheers. - Cheers. Great band. Hey honey. "My birthday! I forgot to call. I was so tired I fell asleep right away. I'll be there. I'll come straight from the airport. I told you I want to go there together. I didn't answer, because I was in the shower. I'm not stressed, I'm busy. I have a flight to catch. I don't have time. You're being ridiculous. Alright, please stop. I'll do it. I'm turning on the computer. It always takes a while to get connected. Hi. Hi? Nice room. It's comfortable. Listen... I made a dinner reservation for eight o'clock. I hope you'll be on time. I'll try. I see. What? I don't get it. If you don't want to go, just say so. We can have dinner at home just as well. I already said I'll try to make it. It means that I want to. 01(3)'- There's no one here with me. No one. Listen... I'm sorry. I'm imagining things. It's stupid. - I really have to go now. - Right now? Unless I want to be late. 01(3)'- - See you tonight - See you. Thank you. Hey, honey. Every-thing OK? I'm kind of in a rush. I'm just leaving. Is it okay if I call you later? Okay. Great. Bye bye. (Hey. hone)!- Yes, still in Vilnius. Did you see the news? The ash cloud. I tried leaving you a message, but there was no connection. And then I forgot. It happens. Is it really that serious? It doesn't mean I don't want to come. Yes, I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. You think I'm responsible for the ash cloud? Why does it always come to this? Can't we just be? We just talk, talk, talk. Analyze everything. You know, I'm actually happy here. I finally have time to myself. I've had it with your accusations. (Hey. hone)!- Hi, dad. Did you miss me already? Where are you? I'm still in Lithuania. You want me to show you my room? Yes. Okay, just a second. That's the front door. There's a toilet and a small kitchen. There's a dining table, the living room and over there is the bedroom. And a bathroom with a tub. Look, it's evening here, just like over there. What do you think? When are you coming home? Honey, you are coming to Dubai tomorrow. Then I have a few more days of work, but then we'll have a holiday together. Why can't you come home now? Honey... You know I still have work to do. Hey. Look... I got us a new game. We can play it together. When balls with the same color land next to each other... They explode and you get points. Nice, right? How many nights until the holiday? I'll show you. Let's count together. One. Two. Three. Four. Four nights. - That's a lot. - But only one night before you come to Dubai. Then we'll do all kinds of fun things together. We'll go swimming and... What's the matter, honey'! Granny said we might not be able to leave, because oi the ash chum. It might be gone by tomorrow. If not, you'll leave as soon as it's gone. We won't miss the holiday. I promise. Okay - You know who I love more than anything? - Yeah, yeah... I love you more than anything. I'll go and play Playstation now. Bye. Bye. Can 't open the photos. Can you send them again in Tiff format? - Hi. - Hey. - Can you see me? - Yes. It's cute. - It's for you. - Thank you. I just saw the news. The ash cloud is lifting. I'll leave at 9.30 in the morning. If all goes well. I'm waiting for the confirmation. I miss you. Listen... There has to be a solution. We can work this out. Everything that's happened... I don't... What? I don't know if I miss you. There's too much you don't know. I know. Do you want me to come home? No. Of course I want you to, but you have to want it yourself. Only if you want it yourself. Hello. Hello. I was starting to hope you wouldn't answer. You didn't get on the plane? No. You know... I hoped, but... I think... I already knew. Kisses. From me as well.
