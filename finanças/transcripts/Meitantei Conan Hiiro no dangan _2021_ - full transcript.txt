You, a detective, don't know What is cooling? Yes sorry I will tell you Inside the MRI machine Superconducting Magnets Superconducting magnets installed Superconducting Magnets Superconducting Magnets To keep the working temperature at a low level Superconducting Magnets To keep the working temperature at a low level Liquid helium in the instrument helium cair Liquid helium in the instrument helium cair But once the temperature rises due to several factors helium cair Liquid helium will evaporate quickly This is the cause That's right After cooling occurs The oxygen content in the air will be quickly pulled down by helium It will be life threatening in a few minutes but There must be a safety device to avoid this danger why This kind of drip station should not appear in the MRI room emergency stop And someone pressed the emergency stop button emergency stop And someone pressed the emergency stop button How about this? I think it's because This thing is close to the superconducting magnet from the MRI machine Someone pressed the emergency stop button in a hurry That's why it leads to quench But in general If the emergency button is pressed The pipes in the hospital have to be closed, right? That's right If there is smoke The pipes in the hospital will be closed divert The pipes in the hospital will be closed divert Only the ventilation duct to the outside will be opened divert Only the ventilation duct to the outside will be opened Why just like that?

The speed of the vacuum superconducting maglev train can be judged according to the color of the body How does the vacuum superconducting fast train work? There are a total of seven body colors, please remember! How does the vacuum superconducting fast train work? How does the vacuum superconducting fast train work? When the train starts, it will run on wheels Then when the speed of the car exceeds 150 kilometers per hour The train will depend on the attraction of magnets and coils Floating on the track After that, the maglev train will enter the vacuum tunnel Reduces air resistance in tunnels Cars run at speeds of up to 1,000 kilometers per hour But the train can control the speed in the tunnel Finally the train came out of the tunnel After the speed drops to 300 kilometers per hour Air brake system will start Then the speed dropped even further to 150 kilometers per hour The wheels that were originally stored at the bottom of the carriage will be released Fast Train has no driver So who's driving? This problem This question is good In fact, we are in a vacuum superconducting high-speed railcar Equipped with a manually controlled cab Manual taxi Equipped with a manually controlled cab but This cabin was used during the trial Usually not used In line with that The main control room is located between Shin-Nagoya Station and Shibahama . Station Will be responsible for operating the train Then let's see How is the situation in the car when the train is running?

But this way The train can't take part in the opening ceremony 10,000 flag-raising activities on trains will also be stopped That's President Alan's creativity That's right How can you consider the situation of the high-speed train and stop the activity in a relaxed manner? But We still have to contact the main control room Leave it to me Conan will be hai Can you wait a little longer? no it's time so be it Go We need to find Chief Alan as soon as possible Conan That was the shot just now, right?

Then you want to say Did you happen to take this fast train? The most important is Maiko Shirato your name And the shooting captive 15 years ago Maiko Shirasu And the shooting captive 15 years ago And the shooting captive 15 years ago Maiko Shirasu si ra ha to ma i ko Makoto Ishihara i si ha ra ma ko to And the shooting captive 15 years ago Maiko Shirasu si ra ha to ma i ko Makoto Ishihara i si ha ra ma ko to Makoto Ishihara's katakana is the same Maiko Shirasu si ra ha to ma i ko Makoto Ishihara i si ha ra ma ko to Maiko Shirasu si ra ha to ma i ko Makoto Ishihara i si ha ra ma ko to This shouldn't be a coincidence Maiko Shirasu si ra ha to ma i ko Makoto Ishihara i si ha ra ma ko to Your father insisted that he was innocent but died in the end You can't give his name I'm not wrong Alan this weapon I am very happy You still remember Correct It's the same model as the murder weapon 15 years ago This culprit Which is your father? Confessed innocence 15 years ago But the FBI caught my dad Do you remember? Was that the first victim of that case 15 years ago? i remember that Is an executive of a Japanese confectionery company When Japanese corporate executives are kidnapped My dad is with me In other words, he has an alibi at that time I said the same thing in my testimony to the FBI But my father is still arrested He screamed injustice until he died in prison My mother came to Japan But soon he was exhausted Also died That's why you always hate the FBI So I listened to the US Marshals Office's suggestion to change my name and surname Is it a witness protection plan in a judicial transaction? you Know a lot Yes, to the people of the US Marshals Don't understand Japanese katakana So they don't find I use my father's name Then seven years ago God is finally on my side Seven years ago Tokyo gains qualification to host this World Sports Association yes, and This man is also that year Becoming president of the World Sports Association This is the will of God That's why you got involved in the Japan World Sports Association? Yes That's why I knew that this person was going to take the fast train this "Japanese bullet" That's why you planned the same case as 15 years ago I do this to remind this person of his sins But you didn't kill anyone else before That's right I just need to kill him alone You're out of me I want to wait for the "Japanese bullet" to arrive at the terminal Take this person's life again But thanks to your blessing, the plan has changed I will kill him now Looks like god Still by my side Stop right now what you just said As long as I die That's right I just need to kill you Okay Shoot here Tuan Mackenzie here Shoot here Shoot from a higher position So even if the bullet goes through my body It will only touch the floor Aim for my chest Shoot from a higher position So even if the bullet goes through my body It will only touch the floor High-speed trains are designed to travel at high speeds Use a very light material, right? Of course If the bullet hits a wall or ceiling Dangerous train Everyone present will be in danger Even though the floor is quite strong But shooting from very close range is also easy to penetrate So you have to be at the farthest distance so that the bullet can hit the left chest Shoot me from the highest position possible That's what Mr. Alan said Shut up and stop talking nonsense Nona shirahato I think you should know Mr. Alan used to be a shooter Also expert shooters who participated in previous experience events Conan father here Shoot here Higher Defeat Return Raise your hands up take a step back snow Shot removal verification? Conan What is wrong What has happened who's this Who shot him? Yokohama Machida The person who shot must be Mr. Akai Yokohama Machida The person who shot must be Mr. Akai But shouldn't the show be? Still in Nago? Fast car Tokyo Just arrived near Yamanashi Tokyo Yamanashi Just arrived near Yamanashi nagoya Just arrived near Yamanashi nagoya It's impossible to successfully become a sniper at this distance nagoya It's impossible to successfully become a sniper at this distance So Mr. Akai Only customize special bullets Not made of iron It's made of silver Silver bullets will not be orbited by magnetic levitation Electromagnets hang on the sidewall The electromagnetic induction effect between the electromagnets not only allows the train body to levitate It can also make bullets fly in the trajectory Current speed It can also make bullets fly in the trajectory Current speed Flying at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour Current speed Flying at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour After entering the vacuum tunnel Almost unaffected by gravity and air resistance Chase behind a maglev car at a constant speed This time If the fast train slows down suddenly And the slowdown lasts for a long time The silver bullet will be during the slowdown period Ultra-light car body that goes through the maglev kereta train At this time, as long as the vital part of the perpetrator Only in pre-calculated positions Snipers can be successful This requires the cooperation of someone in the carriage Is that person? That's right, Edogawa Conan Nona shirato Conan sera chan Are you okay Everyone is fine Why did the perpetrator get shot Did the gun explode? Leave this alone Hurry up let the fast train stop nearby Call an ambulance Taking into account the operating status of the high-speed train Nearest station What is the terminal?

Yumi Yumi Yumi Did you mean: accomplice That's right Conan It seems that Shirato's sister is also aware of this new brother Of course you would notice it if you saw that kind of thing Obviously someone was operating the car from a distance And when the perpetrator is in danger In other words, there are accomplices who are secretly helping The prisoner was carrying a large suitcase containing President Alan Get on this fast car After breaking free at the airport Although the police force at Shin-Nagoya Station is insufficient, It's not easy to ride a car like this In other words, accomplice Related to fast cars And it's a boy Really? Mr. Inoue You can think of this cooling method and put it into practice Eligible to be a magnetic levitation technology engineer Talking about electric trains and nuclear magnetic resonance Superconducting magnets are used You are responsible for debugging You can't be bothered with this little trick Can use remote operation The person who just made sudden braking like that Only you can monitor real-time images in the car Magnetic Levitation Engineer Give it back to me Don't you want to run away? find it The software connected to the main control room of the maglev kereta train It hurts me back Why are you doing this Among the people involved in the case 15 years ago Only two Japanese One of them is the suspect Makoto Ishihara The others are the first victims The executives of that dim sum company that person Is my father What did you say After my dad stopped sponsoring world experience Criticized in the US He was finally dismissed by the company's board of directors Newport Beach Case 15 years ago Newport Beach Newport Beach Taking everything our family has Newport Beach This car stops: Tokyo Chuanpin Taking everything our family has This car stops: Tokyo Chuanpin But the FBI This car stops: Tokyo Chuanpin But the FBI But caught the wrong criminal and declared the case closed Catching the wrong criminal Four years later The copycat was caught Atlanta: 15 years ago The copycat was caught Atlanta: 15 years ago I recognize that person's face One of the criminals who kidnapped my father 15 years ago Like that But my testimony Hidden by the FBI Just to beat people becomes a trick That's why you hate the FBI My father was accused of being unbearable in the US. We really can't live in America anymore That's why you came to Japan After coming to Japan I was investigating this case 15 years ago online I found a woman who has the same hatred as me Maiko Shirasu He is your accomplice, right Right Go out stop bastard father Young Detective What happened to Huihara Young Detective Young Detective how is the situation?

Did the perpetrator chase the fast train? I'm afraid so Jodie I understand Camel Yes Go to Yachi Bridge now good Conan, your two cell phones Can you show me I also want to know who I am Who's this Or are you saying that for a reason Can't let me see plan Notice: Five minutes before the train arrives at Shibahama Station There he is Beginning what sound is it possible The train is going fast Shibahama Station is almost there Gotta start slowing down Does he still want Mr. Alan's life? He really intended to use this "Japanese bullet". find it Black German car It should be that one careful Well What's with that car? Do not dare to show up? Start chasing At this speed, the wheel cannot be lowered The magnetic pole of the track cannot be reversed Is there no way to solve it? There's no point if you ask me In a fast car There are manual taxis, right? Connect to main control room to receive signal Maybe they can fight together no How can ordinary people drive? Besides, it's still a child Less bullshit and hurry up No brakes not responding unlucky Haibara, we did it according to the requirements of the main control room But the train still doesn't slow down Current speed 1000km/h Why doesn't the speed change at all Current speed 1000km/h Current speed 1000km/h Can't find the reason Current speed 1000km/h It is said that even the main control room cannot be controlled how Unknown programs take control of the system That's why I can't stop In other words Perpetrators set up other systems first What will happen like this? After the track is completely turned off The buoyancy of magnetic levitation will be lost The train slows down gradually finally The body of the car will touch the ground Emergency landing It does not matter As long as the train's superconducting magnets don't fail The car will not slip Even if the speed drops The train can still Landing in a relatively balanced position Who are you Just an elementary school student who really likes science What has happened camel Is it okay with your car skills? of course But I'm not used to the road conditions in this area No problem I'll show you the way Shuichi Akai Don't leave it to me Shuichi Akai I already remember all the maps in the area Well Um I thought about it Trick win First, the offensive must be divided into two groups Joed, Camel You are divided into two groups Akai, we are divided into two teams What to do next show The first way remains the same Camel kept chasing The second way is standby at the next location Standby This is an irregular cover layout It only takes five steps for the public Too slow Let's go after the culprit We got the news Fast train speed out of control it will hit Shibahama station in five minutes What did you say Everyone Please keep calm and don't stop Everyone is behind me Don't worry, professor What happened What Was it an earthquake?
