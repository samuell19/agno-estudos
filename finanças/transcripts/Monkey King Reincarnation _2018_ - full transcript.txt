Wukong, as a magic stone in a previous incarnation, you have no human heart, so you can't understand the suffering common people go through before they become immortal. Cut the crap. Let me fight Buddha again. In this case, it'll be futile to try to change your nature and temperament by imprisoning you here for 500 years. Today, I'll turn your stone heart into a man that will experience love in the mortal world. All appearances are empty and false. Like a tiny drop of dew, or a bubble floating in a stream; like a flash of lightning in a summer cloud, or a flickering lamp, an illusion, a phantom, or a dream. So is all conditioned existence to be seen. Now is the time! I'm curious... If Sage of Sword dares to show up today. The master is gonna marry her apprentice. What a joke! Just blame it on our failure to defeat her so that she became the head of martial arts circles. She made us all lose face. I'm Zhou You, nicknamed Nobility Sword. Mr. Gongsun, I didn't expect to meet you here. Legend has it that the weapon you use is the best in all the land. The imperial court wants to choose a new leader of martial arts circles next month. Can I borrow the Beam Split Sword for the competition? That's not the sword you want, and I'm not interested in what you said. I'm not Sage of Sword at all. You've got the wrong person. Mr. Gongsun, you really live up to your name. I give up. Not bad! You managed to stay conscious. Don't hate me. All I need is money. I didn't kill them. They'll wake up in six hours. I'm scared. I thought it was a gold bar. You're poor! You don't have a penny to your name. Why did you come to the restaurant? To beg for food? You're good-looking. It's a waste for you to be a beggar. Do you need money? It's yours. Go get a drink. You're under my protection from now on. How about being my disciple? I'm Qin Yueer. Just mention my name if anyone dares to bully you. Were you sent here to take me back? Our master looks down upon me. Yueer, we just wanted to say hi. Don't be so serious. Cut the crap. I won't go back with you. Alas, Yueer-- isn't it great to marry a regional commander? He's loaded. You'll have over ten maidservants waiting on you if you marry him. I won't marry someone I don't like, even if he was the emperor. What? You wouldn't marry an emperor? Don't tell me you'd marry a beggar. I'd be dead set on following someone I like, even if he was a beggar. Don't waste time. Knock her out and take her back. Please! Stop it! Our master will be pissed off if he learns about it. Do you still think they look down on you? Who... Who are you? You'd better stay out of it. He... He... He's my bodyguard. Hey. I'm senior to you. How dare you hit me like that? Get lost, or I'll tell him to castrate all of you. Let's go. Hurry up. Let's go. The best swordsman under heaven will be trouble in the future if he is not on our side. You guaranteed you'd be able to kill Sage of Sword. I lost because of a momentary oversight. Please give me one more chance. Don't bother. Please spare my life. Don't kill me! Get someone stronger to deal with Gongsun Xun. Please don't kill me! Gongsun Xun met a woman who looks exactly like his master, Su Hong. The plan has to be changed. Keep watching Gongsun, and find a way to capture that woman. Got it. Mr. Gongsun, thanks for saving me. Well. I take back what I said about you being my disciple. Please forgive me. Come on. Let me propose a toast. Cheers! You don't look like a local. Why are you here in Hangzhou? I'm bound to pay a debt of gratitude. Do you need any help? Now that you don't want to tell me, I won't ask you again. Come on. Let's drink. I'm here... to forget someone. Huh? I want to find the kind of liquor that makes you forget everything so you can start over. Really? I've never heard of that kind of liquor. It's called "Befuddled Life." I've informed everyone in the martial arts circles that you've been discharged and won't be my disciple anymore. Master! Don't say that about me! Master! Go! Master. Go! Don't kneel to me! I don't want to see you again! I didn't expect the gold sword would be so heavy. After selling it, I'll get over ten maidservants to wait upon me. Zhu Dafen! You nasty girl. What have you got this time? Don't try to fool me again. Get out. Shut up. Let me show you. Gold blade. Black iron handle. Able to split beams and chop air, but not hurt humans. As for attacking rivals and destroying weapons, it's No. 1 in the world. Answer me. Where did you get it? Cut the crap. 10, 000 taels of silver. Pay it. Now! Humph. Even if you don't tell me, I know that you stole it from a handsome young man... who is about 6 feet tall, and has an impressive presence, right? Wow! Zhu Dafen, do you have the secret sight? How do you know that? Because he's staring at you from behind. Handsome, as you can see. I have nothing to do with this. Handsome, don't worry. I'm just afraid that more of my things are destroyed. It's better to make her fall into sleep. I'll leave her to you. Do whatever you like. Alas, he scooped her up. It's embarrassing. I need to figure out how much I've lost. Yesterday, I saw an old friend at the fair. He told me... that he found a kind of liquor in the east which can make people forget everything, so they can start over. Do you think that's true, or not? If you had a real chance to start over, would you still take me as your master? He told me that the sword is yours, since you like it so much. Where is he? He's gone. Hey! Don't be stupefied. Drink the antidote, and go find him! Why do I have to do that? Tell me how much you'd pay for the sword. Hurry up. That's a token of love. I don't dare buy it. It's not! Calm down. If I buy it, my life span will be cut short. Alas, you young people are so cheesy when you fall in love. I'm telling you. The sword is an invaluable asset. If he didn't take a fancy to you, why did he send it to you? You know? He cares about you. Yesterday, it had been raining the whole night. Afraid that you would get wet, he spent the night at the gate, with you on his back. But what were you doing? You were sound asleep. Hey. Come on in. Staying on your back, she couldn't sleep well, either. I've heard there's a kind of liquor called "Befuddled Life" nearby. Mr. Zhu, do you know where I can find it? One of my friends runs a liquor store at Shuangpu Town in the south. I've heard that there is a kind of wine called "Befuddled Life." Those who drink this wine will forget everything. It's hot! I'm sorry. Another bowl, please. Here you are. You're awake. Why did you give it to me? I'm Yukong, icknamed Iron Buddha. Can I challenge you to a match? Because you like it. I won't need to use it, anyway. Can I challenge you? I don't need your sword. Take it. Can we have a competition? Alas, you make a lot of noise. Competition, right? Take it. You're rude. I'll teach you a lesson. Hold on. Hmm. Mr. Gongsun is awesome! Beat him! Beat him! Freeze! Younaughty girl. You'll lose your life because of money sooner or later. I know it's you. I'd rather die because of money than marry that commissioner. Crazy girl. When did you start hanging around with Sage of Sword? Unfasten it. And... don't try to take the gold ingots back. Okay. Go back with me if you want gold. I got it from that commissioner. He treats you well, right? He's generous to you. You like money, and he's generous with his money. Oh. Gosh. What a perfect match! Master, be careful! Brat! It seems you've got the wrong rival. Master, you're awesome! I love you! Explode! Don't worry. He's my master. I told you to check a person out before you steal his stuff, but you never listen to me. See? You must have offended someone, and now he's looking for revenge. Luckily, we managed to escape. Come on. Be happy. Go back with me. I'll prepare Roasted Hare for you. It's your favorite. I don't want to marry that man. Do as you wish. I've got enough money from him, anyway. As a girl, you shouldn't fool around so much. It's not safe. Now, I've got a large amount of money. Let's go somewhere else with Asan, Asi, and Xiaopu. Where should we go? Sichuan is a good choice. You like chili peppers, right? What's the matter? Did you lose money? I don't want to go back. Alas. You're an unmarried young woman. Do you want to roam the world with Sage of Sword? Sage of Sword? Did you take a fancy to him? Hmm. Alas. You wicked girl. I told you, trust nothing... except money. But... I'm no exception. Love and affection is entirely imaginary. He gave me his gold sword without hesitation and took care of me the whole night. Huh? The whole night? Fine. Go ahead. Go to him. Really? You're not kidding, right? Of course not. You'll find a way to come back for him, even if you go back. Am I right? Leave, before I change my mind Ungrateful thing. You even didn't look back. All right. Come out. However, I think you've got the wrong rival. The leader of martial arts circles serves as an official. The country will fall into disorder again, right? The hero of the age will just become a puppet and have an undeserved reputation. You're the best in all the land. Why don't you compete for the title of hero of the age? They won't fight unless it's a last resort. Why are you following me? You followed me first. Why did you follow me? Did you take a fancy to me? Then why did you send me the sword? Sir, give me one of the best guest rooms. Okay. Two. There is only one left. The hotel is fully booked. I'm hungry. Let's have a meal first. Hey! Hey. Waiter. Waiter. I... Madam, what are you doing? We're sitting at the table. Young guys should be generous. Can't we just share it? Can't you see that I'm blind in one eye? Madam, what would you like to order? Braised Fish in Brown Sauce, SautÃ©ed Fish with Vinegar Sauce, Hairy Crabs, Grilled Beef, Roasted Chicken, Roasted Duck, Roasted Goose, and Braised Meat Balls in Brown Sauce. Hey! Can you finish that many dishes by yourself? Plus a bottle of Maiden Rose. Go! Hurry up! Okay! I'm starving. Hurry up. We haven't ordered. Don't bother. I'll share with you. It's more fun. Wow! One more left. You must be full. It's time to work. Since this is your treat... I didn't say that! I'll tell your fortune for you. Peach blossoms spontaneously burn. Marriage is unfulfilled. I give you my heart, but we're thousands of miles apart. Three cycles of reincarnation are destined to happen. You'll spend your years alone until you die, if your heart never gets healed. Sir, please, have a look. Predestined marriage is just like flowers in the mirror, and the moon in water. It's both real and imaginary, like a dream or a wisp of smoke. What you grasp is what you put down. What you put down is all emptiness. Awesome! It sounds too profound to be understood. My turn! Your Mr. Right is a great hero. He'll step on seven-color clouds to marry you. Are you happy? Can you make it more specific? Alas. Your Mr. Right is a great hero who looks exactly like him. It must be him. Really? When should we get married? Let me tell your fortune. I don't know what you're talking about. All right. Pay me. Come on. Hey. You told me that you don't know fortune telling. Spontaneous ignition. Seven-color clouds... You're exaggerating. Alas, you know nothing about that. Just keeping the conversation lively. I remembered those words when I was a matchmaker. Eh? What's up? You promised to pay more than this. I paid for the meal. Don't try to swindle me. Well, it... Alas. What a nasty girl! Well. Don't waste food. Hmm. It's good! Kung fu masters from different schools are present here, so I officially announce... the head of martial arts circles will be the top performer. The winner of each round who stamps his or her rival's forehead with cinnabar on the index finger will go to the next round. No weapons. No damage to the hotel property. I'm Yue Song from the Huashan Sect. Please favor me with your instructions. I'm Zhang Zizhen from the Emei School. Awesome! Mr. Yue, well done! Does anyone else want to challenge Mr. Yue? The Huashan Sect is an orthodox martial arts school with 100 years history. Since Mr. Yue Zhengfeng, the former person-in-charge, presided over the martial arts circles, it has won respect from all other schools. Martial arts of the Huashan Sect is extensive and profound, but pitifully, I've mastered only one tenth of that. So, I'm embarrassed to be called an almighty martial artist. Now that you've recommend me to lead the martial arts circles, I'm bound to spare no effort in the performance of my duty. When the hero of the age is conferred on me and I lead my army as commander-in-chief... He's really not a good actor. I'll fight to the death for my people. Great! Terrific! Now, I officially announce that... Hold on! Someone wants to challenge him. Who are you? From which school? Answer me. I am... nobody. I just hate to see you gang up to get the title of head of the martial arts circles. Cut the crap. Compete with me if you dare. Do you want to beat a woman? You freak. I'm Ling Xiaofeng from Lingjue Sect. I'd like to compete with you. Lingjue Sect was founded just ten years ago. Without a reference, you're unqualified to run for leader. The head of the martial arts circles will be the top performer. That's what you said just now. Do you want to go back on your word? You asked if anyone wanted to challenge Mr. Yue, but you say he's unqualified when he wants to have a try. So, what's the point of holding the competition? Is it just a show? Fine. If he needs a reference, I, Qin Yueer from Taohua Valley, will vouch for him. Mr. Ling from Lingjue Sect to compete for head of martial arts circles. Does anyone else join me? Me! Me! Humph. Mr. Yue, let's get started. Let's go inside and have a look since we're here already. Wow! That's the legendary "Befuddled Life." Do people really forget everything after drinking it? To be accurate, people will forget what they hate to forget most. Oh. Hold on. Is it expensive? I have money. Tell me. What is the last thing you want to forget? I killed someone. Someone who loved me dearly. This way, please. Stay out of my business. Let me go inside alone. What's up? I killed someone. The person who loved me most. Didn't you drink it? I'll do it after I go back to the Kunlun Mountains. Why didn't you ask who was killed? You asked me to stay out of your business. So, where are you going? Please stay out of mine, too. Okay. See... I'm leaving. See you. Sir, what would you like to order? Excuse me. How long does it take to get the closest hotel in the west? Ten days, if you go there on foot. Three days if on horseback. Get a horse for me. Okay. No problem. Sir, this way, please. Have some tea. I'll get a horse for you. Hmm. Dear all, I'm back. Xiaopu! Yueer. What's happened? Where is our master and the others? A group of men in black came here last night. They took all the fellow apprentices away. What about our master? He hasn't been back since he went out for you. They asked me to stay here and pass on a message. The emperor will confer the hero of the age on Ling Xiaofeng tomorrow. You have to sneak into Ling's mansion and steal his seal of commander-in-chief to get our master and the others back. Here's Mr. Yue! Welcome! Congratulations! Xiaofeng. This way, please! Thieves! It's you again! How dare you kill Mr. Ling? It's on fire! Anyone! Put out the fire! Sir, everything has been arranged properly, as you ordered. Yue Song has gone to capture her with the heads of different sects. Well finally be rid of these outlaws. I've been waiting for this for ten years. Get the last thing done. Don't cause Yue Song to doubt. Why do you help him? Anyone who helps him is our enemy. No exceptions, even if you're the God of Sword. Guys, go! Thanks for saving my life. You have my respect. I didn't aim to save you. What I want to save... Hmm? ...is them. What do you mean? After they kill you, someone else will be assigned to take your place, just as its always been. But we won't have peace, since we've offended the imperial court. Miss Su, you're really chivalrous and kind-hearted. You deserve to be No. 1 in the world. Come on. Let's have another toast, you and me. From today on, they won't dare to bother you again. But if you want to remain carefree after retirement, I suggest... you show some mercy to the common people, and be free from corruption. How dare you? I'm Guo Shuang, nicknamed Hand-chopping Shura. Someone asked me to compete with you. We do martial arts mainly for self-cultivation instead of competition. It's no good to do that. I'm no match for you. Just kill me. I won't. Just tell me who asked you to compete with me. Thanks for sparing my life. It's... Go! Stop chasing me. Her accomplice is the best in the land. Then it's something beyond our ability. Listen up! Go back and gather all the master-hands before we discuss this again. Didn't you go back to the Kunlun Mountains? Why are you here? I planned to go to Taohua Valley, but there was a plot against me on my way that led me here. It seems we were set up. Someone tried to kill you. They knew you'd help me, so they led you here on purpose. To lead people to believe that you're my accomplice. Yueer, what are you doing? You've been poisoned by Ziyinsan. If the blood isn't sucked out in time, you'll die when it reaches your heart. You're a silly girl. I'm bound to pay every debt of gratitude. You were hurt because of me, right? Master! Master! Maybe everyone meets someone... with whom you can't be together. I love you, but I can't have you. Memories don't just go away. Stay alive, and wait for me with a red bridal veil. I'll marry you at Taohua Valley. Shame on you. Did I promise to marry you? Gather Gongsun and Qin Yueer together before we inform the martial arts circles to go after them. Then tell Yue Song that he'll be the new head of martial arts circles when Yueer is caught. When Gongsun and Qin are surrounded, you ambush him, and take your time killing him. Got it! Step back, or I'll kill you. We know that you're No. 1 in the world. Having fame and prestige, we won't act recklessly, but we have to give everyone an account since the woman killed Mr. Ling. I promise that you'll be safe, as long as you hand her over to us. If you insist on protecting her, I'm afraid... Xun, leave me alone. The Lingjue Sect, Wudang School... Go! Emei School... I don't think the other schools will let you go, either. It was someone else who killed Mr. Ling. Stop quibbling. I saw her and Mr. Ling with my own eyes. Besides, he was poisoned with the needle of Taohua Valley. You were the one who framed us. Am I right? Now, it's time to get rid of her. It seems that... I can't live till the day you marry me. Here you are. That day... That day, I switched your "Befuddled Life" when you weren't looking because I was afraid... afraid... to learn that I wasn't the one you hate to forget most. However, I'm not afraid now. The days I spent with you were short, but they were the happiest time of my life. Xun, remember... In the future, cherish the one you're with. Drink... the liquor. To wipe out the outlaws, I've endured them for ten years. Finally, they'll be annihilated today. Ten years ago, a rumor went around that people would forget everything once they drank our liquor. From then on, a lot of people have come here for it. Many of them didn't have any special feeling, so they thought it was a lie and destroyed my store. But some... remembered nothing after drinking it. They abandoned their families and relatives, leaving for somewhere else. Some of them spent the rest of their life like a lunatic always muddleheaded. Actually, "Befuddled Life" is just a kind of common liquor, but it became an excuse for those people... who wanted to escape from reality. In my opinion, you don't need an excuse. How can he be considered the greatest hero? He can't even protect his beloved. The pain of love is the first taste of suffering in the mortal world. To go through that, Yueer chose to sacrifice herself, which proves her selfless love. The lost one, without being cherished, can't be retrieved. From what you went through in this lifetime, you'll learn to cherish those who treat you well. 500 years from now, you'll be saved at the foot of Wuzhi Mountain. I'll do my best to protect it if there is a future. He'll come to you with this gold band. You have to help him deliver the common people from torment to repay him for what he did for you. His name is Jiang Liuer.
