Hail to Raw mango party. Where are these stones coming from? Who is throwing it on us? Hey, Khanduri! What is this scandal? Where did our people go? Where these people raised for this? - To hide instead of saving me. - Sir! What will they do? Stones will not check, whether it's a mango or an orange? So, who has stopped you? You also start throwing stones on them. - Sir! But, we don't have stones? - Idiot! Throw the same stones on them. "This is Sagar Obama, MLA, post candidate." "And, this is his elder brother Dabar Obama, Former MLA." "Who gave assurance to people, but, did nothing." "His younger brother, is also on the same path." "Elder brother is remarkable, but the younger one, is even more remarkable." You bastard's! Why are you hiding? - Am I paying you for not saving me? - Sir! Sir! Congratulations! Congratulations! - Now, even they are throwing stones at us. - Congratulations! - At us? Why? - Yes. - You told me that they don't have stones. - Sir! We gave them. - You traitor, why did you give them? - Oh! Sir! You didn't understand, the stones that we threw at them... Now, they are throwing the same stones at us. "This is Zaffar Abbazi! He is also, a candidate for MLA post." "By staying in power, he has also fooled the public." "Both of these political arenas, always keep bouncing stones on each other." Hello! Dad. - Mom! Get me a cup of tea too. - Yes son, I'll be right there. So! Prince is awake? Do you know, what's the time right now? It's 11:00AM. He is awake? Why are you shouting at him? He is spoiled by your love. If he is going to behave the same way then, one day, we might not get food to eat. Whole day he roams like a loafer, with his stupid friends. He is not a loafer, don't say anything to my son? If you, care about your father's identity, then, look for a job. When the time comes he will start working-business... Hopefully, I don't have to throw him out of the house someday! Oh Allah! What kind of father are you? You'll throw, your own son out of the house? Then, you only make him understand. Your's is a daily habit to cause agitation. (Sighs) "This is Aman, his full name, Aman Osama, he has a rare disease." "To behave weirdly at times, let's see how he got this disease." His ancesters, at the of partition, "had come from Lahore to Agra, and settled here forever." "His Father, Mr. Abbas Osama, believes in all kinds of religions." "That's why, he gave his sisters hand..." "happily to the boy of her choice for marriage." "His decency, became a trouble for his government job." "Because of which, he never got promoted." What happened? You look tensed? Did you get promoted? When I didn't receive promotion in the house then... How, can I get promotion in the office? - What did you say, Aman's father? - It's correct. I have become a slave, at home, and also... In the office. Why do you always have to remove office exasperation at home? You tell them, how honestly you work! And that, you deserve a promotion. It's not possible, with those dishonest, inferior people sitting on my head... They say, because of me not taking any bribe, they are not able to get the benefit. You don't get dejected, Aman's father. - Lord Allah! Will do everything fine. - "Everyone is used to living like a dog." "Little Aman, from the age of eight, he is watching his..." "Favourite Artist, Nana Patekar's movie." "Which had a profound impact on his mind." Seeing his father's life, troubled by corruption... "A strange disease was born, inside small Aman." Good! Aman, Today also you didn't complete your homework? Your heart is not in studies, what is this? The entire book is empty, what do you do at home? Wow! Wow! Pen woman, Wow! I wish! These copies of ten rupees... These copies were thrown on those corrupted people instead of me. There, my dad is paying for his honesty, and you are worried about the homework? - Wow! Pen woman, Wow! - Principal Ma'am! (Laughter) Wow! You redeemed Madam's senses. - Today, you did an amazing work. - Good one! Good one! "Wow! Wow! Pen woman, Wow!" "You are trying to save the poor huts, with the help of newspapers." Aman! But that time has gone when... - Aman! - Yes Dad! Now newspaper has turned into a business. - What did you do in the school? - Nothing! Then, why is there a complaint? Today, sixth time we have received complain. From now on, if you do anything in the school? I'll get you out of the school, and make you sit at home, understood? (Laughter) Hey Dad! Don't hit me here, there's a small brain here. If you hit here then, the person will not be able to listen or speak. What will you get by kicking me out from the school, school people will only kick me out, understood? (Thud) Aman! Aman! (Clink) Cheers! Kissing booth? What is this kissing booth? - There's a poetry on kissing booth. - Tell us. (Burps) - In the city of Shahajahan! - Oh!

"Atleast, tell me what is the problem? I had informed you about my girlfriend?" - "That, MLA's daughter, Shaheen?" - "Yes, man!" "That MLA has created a new scene,." "He has bet that, I have to campaign for his upcoming party." "So that, he can get christians vote because, muslims are already with him." "And, he will only give his daughter's hand, if he wins." "These politicians, don't leave anybody to save their seats." "That's right! But, what to do now? Listen, brother!" "I'm not at all good with this speech stuff, but your brain..." "Your brain, is the father of the super computer." "I'm very sure, that you will help me." "You please, come to Greater Noida, so that, your brother..." "Don't die, thinking about that MLA'S bet."

Sir, I feel something fishy. - What kind of name do you have? - Sir, everyone likes to call me Aman. Aman! Even I don't know your complete name. Tell me? - Even I want to know. - You love me or my surname? Sir! Something's definitely wrong. Till the time, you don't tell your complete name... - How will I take everything ahead? - Sir! Aman... - Osama. - Speak out loud. - Aman Osama! - Why didn't you tell me... - ..that your name is Aman Osama. - Baby! You never asked me. Relax Kids! Look son! It's good that there's no Bin laden in your surname, otherwise, it would have been big problem. (Bird Chirping) Anyway, it's a part of joke. See, I believe in all the religions. My thinking is like this. Because my mother herself was hindu, from U.P. But, question is not about my thinking... ..it's about my political party. Elections are coming soon. If tomorrow, people come to know that, MLA's daughter... ..was roaming with a muslim boy, then, you know what can happen? But, don't be afraid. I haven't completed my conversation yet. I have a solution for every problem. Tell me, what do you do? Oh God! I haven't told maggie yet, about the kissing booth... Then, how can I tell them both? - Aman! Tell dad about your work. - Sir! I love maggie endlessly. - And I can do anything for her. - Sir wants to know, what work you do? (Getting shock) As of now, I do nothing. Looking for a good job. - Sir! He is a slacker. - Oh fine, this is good. You have got the job, young man! And we have only one solution for this surname problem... You prove yourself in front of my party. Sir! What trick have you played now? By promoting my party, in the forthcoming elections. At your level best. Do something so that, I get all the muslim votes. (Background Music) Listen! You have got three weeks time. I have to beat that Zafar Abbasi in any condition. If I win the election then, your marriage will be fixed with Maggie. Otherwise! Forget Maggie. (Cell Phone Ringing) - I have come to ask her hand or vote. - Hello. - Excuse me! Yes, tell me. - Dad! Idiot! Aman! - Aman! What happened? - What? Raw mango has made my teeth raw. - Means? - You know, your dad tricked me. - Sir, you made a promise but, will you fulfill it? - Khanduri! Just understand that, to balance my daughter, I have... shot the arrow in darkness. Bro! What have you thought, whose side are you? Brother! How will I know that, she is also MLA's daughter. Brother! I think your girlfriends dad and my girlfriends dad... ..are fooling both of us. They know it... That till the election is over, we will be lost in the crowd. If they win, they will be on their way. And if they lose, still, they will be on their way. What will we get? Nothing. That's why, I'm telling you... - Enjoy life and leave tension. - What are you saying? - Brother! I have only one. - Sorry! Sorry! You punctured it. You know that, they are going away from our hands. That doesn't mean... ..you will not leave me worth for anybody. Sorry! Sorry! I got angry on them. - That's why it happened. - Ok. I'll meet my girl tomorrow, and talk to her. To know her plans. (Fountain water sound) Baby! Have it. What happened to you? Why are you so worried? - Aman! I'm worried about two things. - Like? - Like... you are Osama and I'm Obama. - And second thing? - Your work Aman! Who run's kissing booth? - I do, baby! In today's era... ..for Laila majnu, far from the eyes of the world... ..to live in solitude for peace of mind, ..if I give them a safe... ..place to kiss, then, what's wrong in that? You tell me. That is all ok, Aman! You have explained me... But, what about Briganza aunty? How are we gonna explain her? Just assume, if I tell her about dad's bet... But, dad's bet is not easy. Will you be able to fulfill that? Baby! You don't worry. Insha-allah! I'll do everything possible to fulfill your dad's condition. - It's not that. - Then, what it is Baby? I think... - You are hiding something from me. - Aman! - I want to tell you something. - Tell me, what it is? (Claps) - But, why? - Tell me about your work? Sir! I'm looking for a job, you know talented people don't get job easily. Very Good! Fine! Excellent! Because they were inter-caste like us, Aman... and uncle never believed in inter-caste. And one day, Maria thought that, she will never get her love in this house. So, she decided to leave the house, and she left. Uncle could not bear this shock. So, he died because of heart attack. I'm very scared, Aman! This should not happen with us. (Ambulance Siren) Aman! Aman! (Laughs) What have you thought about me? I'm an idiot! Who will be a dog, in front of any leader! When he will say I'll bark, bite and wag my tail in front of him. I am a true revolutionary, I am not going to bend in front of any leader. - Even if it is my dad or your's. - Aman! How dare you say this about my dad? (Shouts) - My hand! - Aman! You... - Why did you say like that about my dad? - Why did you push me? - Why would you do like that? - I didn't do it intentionally jesus swear. I have a disease since, childhood. - Disease? Oh god! Aman what should I do? - Yes, my hand! Baby! - Son! What is the problem? - Look at this hand... It has stopped working. It's your hand or 1000 rupee note, which has stopped working. Doctor! Doctor! When I fell... - It was fine till then. Yes do it. - Now, everything will be ok. I'll make everything right, Gabbar! - Gabbar! You are standing here. - Baby! It's paining a lot. Go and get my, shaking tool from my draw. Go! Go! Go! He is a very nice boy. Nowadays! You don't get such people. He is a single piece, cut piece. - Baby! Where did you find this doctor? - No problem Baby! Get your treatment done. Thank you. - I found him in haste. - Baby! So big? - The bigger, the faster the benefit is. - Nothing! Will happen. - Are you ready? One two... - No! No! - Three. - Mom! I request you all... To vote for the orange party, and we win with a heavy majority. Thank you! Brother's I request you... To elect our party in this election, to win with heavy votes. Our blessings's are with you, go start the preparation for election. And, give us a huge amount of votes. Hail to Orange party. - Orange party. - Hail to Raw mango party. You had given us five years chance to serve you. Uproot such villiany government. - Orange party. - Hail to Raw mango party. (Bike horn sound) (Vehicle sound) What is the matter brother? When Zaffar's man came, you said I'll vote. When Obama's man came, you said I'll vote. - I can't understand anything. - My Friend! Even, I'm playing politics with them, just the way they play with us. (Music) - Will you tell me what's wrong with you? - Joy! You tell her man. I feel like murdering, that doctor shaker. I never even thought, that we will be meeting first time with your girlfriend, - And all this will be happening with us. - Means? Guys it really doesn't matter, Aman! You tell us what happened? This! This! This has happened to me. - The thing what right hand does, - Yes. Left hand does, exactly the opposite. That too, hard. Confused? Wait! I'll explain in detail. While having food, this hand picks the spoon. So, this keeps it back, while bathing I open tap from this hand so this closes it. I have not bathed for three days. And, in toilet I take mug from this hand, it keeps it back. If I take soap with this hand, then this hand keeps it back. I'm not bathing, eating or washing properly. Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! But Joy! - You have jet system in your washroom? - That is also not working. I only know how I wash, nobody will understand my pain. When consiously, I work with left hand then, right hand works very normal. As soon as, the precautionary loss happens, accident takes place. Oh Jesus! Why are we getting so many problems... - Aman! What will we do now? - What we will do? - Will go and beat that damn doctor. - Exactly! Due to his injections I got all this sickness. I'll kill him. Aman! That we will see later. - But, now let's enjoy. - Joy! Let's enjoy! "It beats in my chest, everytime it sulks, Look! Back and forth." "It changes many colors, beats in my chest everytime it sulks, Look! Back and forth." "It changes many colors. You become puppet, You fool anyone." "If not this then you, if not you then someone else." "Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker." "Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker it is." "Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker it is." "Picks up everyone, falls for everyone. There should be no break to it,." "Hence, stays in rumor, flies a lot, And lives Careless." "Why you behave naughty, be like a gameboy." "If not this then you, not you then else." "Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker it is." "Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker it is." "Can't you let a star, better let me get it to you." "It beats, lives like a boss, when look for girls behave happily." "You stay confused, and count starts in Daytime, you'll not get a beauty like me." "Why you stay far away?" "If not this then you, if not you then someone else." "Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker it is." "Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker, Heart lifehacker it is." - Gabbar! You... - You! - Doctor! - Where is the doctor? - You stupid... You treated my left hand instead of right. What is this? - Everyday something or the other happens with me. I had not given invitation that, come to me and take injection. This is not a doctor. He is some mad scientist. What is this? - Doctor doesn't have a degree. - There's no degree? - You ruined our life. - Doctor! - You don't have degree? (Shouting) We won Gabbar! We won! (Barks) Stupid! (Grunts) Oh my god! Boss! You shake everyone... They shook you and went. Sisters! Brothers! The opposition party character is just like their name. Orange party, like we eat orange... If we get any seeds, we throw it away. - I am right or wrong? - Right! So brother, their character is like this only. They do the same thing with you. This time, you give us chance to come again, so that we can serve you. (Claps) And now, your's only Aman Osama! Would like to say something. - Are you ready? Go! - Yes Sir, I'm ready! Friends! We are all gathered here today... For Obama's support. Clap please! (Claps) On the sixth of the month... The messiah of our poor, Politicians, Workers and we all... Muslim brother's favourite, can get Sagar Obama in power. Villiany will end, Corruption, rape, everything will come to an end. - What was next? - What happened? - What happened? - I forgot to tie this. Gaurav, kindly explain it to him. (Ambulance Siren) You all have come to watch this idiot's rally, he will come... will stand here with folded hands and a smiling face asking for votes. And all you'll do is applaud that. You all are impotent and habitual to slavery. First you were slaves of the Britishers and now of these corrupt politicians. In their reign, flour became costlier than data. Look at their faces. It's like squeezed mango and name of the party is 'Raw Mango Party'. "- They will sour your teeth with raw mango." Gaurav, make him understand. Brothers! Sympathiser like him... good leader, you will not get anywhere in the world. So, let Obama... win with your majority of votes. Oh my God! What nonsense is this? I think he's mad. We have not taken off from our work to do timepass. C'mon, let's go. Please wait. You all will get one kilo mango pickle. - Yes. I don't understand what happens to me. I say anything. I have become very frustrated. Now, Obama will definitely kill Osama. (Messaging sound ringtone) Whose message is it? - Can't you keep quiet! Hold this tightly. - Okay bro, carry on. What nonsense is this? - You know what is she saying? - What? She is saying that tie your hand and come. Tie your hand and come. Someone go and explain that it's my hand and not a dog that can be tied anywhere. - Bro your instant poetry habit is still there. - I have no control on it. - Is it poetry or shit?! - You say anything like Gola! - Whose Gola now? - My friend from Agra. He is just like you, talks stupid. You are gone... wait! Oh, this is over. Let's check here. It's not here as well? Take this. Take this. This is what you required. Now I'll see how you get rid of it. Monkey, I love you. (Cell Phone Ringing) - "Hello?" - Yes! Where are you? I'm waiting for you for so long. This lover is standing at your doorstep. - Open the gate madam! - I'm coming. (Foot Steps) - Finally you've come. Come inside! - Let's go. - So what did you bring for aunty? - See for yourself. (Dog Whine) - Aman! What have you brought? - What's the problem with this? Look how cute they are and this was the best that I could have got from that shop. - Dogs are a man's best friend. - Aman. - I forgot to tell you one thing. What is it? Aunty doesn't like dogs. In fact she never liked any pets. She thinks that pets are very dirty. So we don't have any pet in the house. If she saw you with this then she'll throw you out along with this. Why didn't you tell me this before?! Your whole city has sworn that you will trouble this Agra boy. I'm so sorry. I forgot. You do one thing hide them somewhere here. - Move aside! - Yes.

Young Man, do you speak with your inner soul? - Yes. - Very Interesting. Maggie... I think this man is perfect for you because he is learning to cook, he can clean and also entertain you. You're selected boy. - "What is your work in my courtyard..." - Wow! So sweet of you aunty. You slapped me? I am really sorry aunty. I don't know when it came out of my pocket Maggie. How dare you slap me. Remove your hand, remove your hand! I am extremely sorry aunty.
