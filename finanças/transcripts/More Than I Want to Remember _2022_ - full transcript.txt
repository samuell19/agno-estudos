My name is Mugeni. I'm coming from Congo. I was born in a place called Murambya. Our village was so green. Everybody was a farmer. Doesn't matter if you are rich or poor. We share all we have. I grow up knowing there is a people who doesn't like us, my tribe, Banyamulenge. I always think, if I meet with them, they're gonna do something bad to me 'cause I'm different to them. One night, my family was sleeping... All my family, my father, my siblings, my mom, but when we sleep, we heard the noise like the bomb, the shooting. It feels so close to where I live. They was burning the houses. We feel like we're gonna die inside this house. We just ran. Ran to different directions. I was thinking it's two choice. I'm gonna live or die. I was 14 and I was all by myself in the forest. I find the guy who was running, hiding, saving his life, same as me. I didn't know any place besides my village. I just continue following him. He has the child who was the same age I was. I didn't know the guy. He just take me as his child. We were sleeping in forest, sleeping for, like, a month. We didn't eat. We just sleep there on the leaves. We didn't have nothing beside God. It was just thinking about my family. I didn't know what to tell to myself. Then the man told us we are in different country. When we got to Kenya, they guy, he told me, "Oh, okay, I have nothing. Just try to find where you can go." He left me. I didn't judge him. He saved my life. I was really scared seeing people I'd never seen. I didn't even know if they speak Swahili 'cause I've never been in Kenya. We have the same color of skin, but they are different people. I was like, "I have to go to find church for Congolese people." They showed me where the church was. Then I sit near to this girl. She was, like, 22 or 20. Her name is Esparance, and I told her everything. She take care of me, everything. After a couple months, when people was inside the church praying, Kenyan police came to say, "Oh, you can't be over here." They took her to the refugee camp. They decided to take everybody, all Congolese. I don't know the reason why. I wasn't there. I didn't know what to do after that. I used to dream, like, seeing blood all over. People got murdered. Like, all the baddest stuff. Like, screaming, calling my brother, calling my mom. It was, like, feeling, like, so real to me. It was the worst part ever. Dream somebody you love and then don't see them. I would just ask, like, "Why, God? "Why'd that happen to me? "I'm alone. I don't have a family no more." The other days feel like it's okay. You want to make yourself stronger, 'cause you can't just tell your heart to be negative all the time. You want to build your heart to make stronger. I find this United Nation program. It helps with refugee to be resettled to a different country. I told them, "I'm alone. I don't have nobody." They ask, most of the time, the same questions, just to make sure what you said is true. You never know when you're gonna be approved. It took two years. The day I find out I was coming to United State, I didn't know if I should be excited or not, 'cause I was like, "Oh, I'm coming from Congo "to Kenya, go to USA. I don't know nobody over there." When I landed to USA in Michigan, I met people who was waiting for me. In the morning, I woke up. I didn't speak English, so I was just, like, looking at them. I didn't know any words that I can use. I was just, like, thinking, how I'm gonna talk to these people, how I'm gonna talk to my foster mom. I don't know what to say to them. The first meal I had with them, it was eggs. That's all the thing I know how to say, eggs, so I was eating eggs every day. Telling my foster mom, I want eggs, eggs, eggs. It was like a song for eggs. It didn't take me very long to learn English. I was in school. I didn't talk about where I came from. They know I came from Africa. Some, they can't understand my accent, which was, like, hard for me to make friends 'cause I'd be like, "Oh, maybe if I talk, they're gonna laugh at me." I was just keeping to myself. My foster mom, she search on Google trying to find me a Congolese church. One day, she dropped me off over there. I was very surprised to seen people I know in Michigan. I met one family who used to be the neighbor in Kenya where I was living. I made them a friend. I told the father of the family, "I'm trying... if I can find my family "'cause I'm here lonely." He was like, "Oh, okay. Well, I know people, so I can try to help you." I'll be, like, asking him all the time, "Have you heard anything about my family?" One day, he called me. He said, "Someone told me your mom and siblings, "they live in Uganda." "Are you serious?" I ask him so many times. "Are you serious? Are you serious about it? Who told you?" My heart was very speechless. She's alive. It was three years. It was three years since I have talked to her, I've heard her voice. I was like, "I can't wait to say something to her." She was very shocked. "Where are you? How'd you get there? Like, how'd you get to USA?" I was like, "It's a miracle." She ask me, "Where is your dad? "I haven't seen your dad since the time we ran out from the war." In 2019, in summer, I saw my mom for the first time in five years. My mom looked beautiful, more than I remember. Uh... I can't cry. Like, my tears was, like, stuck. Like, I have this happiness inside of me. It makes me feel like where I was broken, is got fixed. My mom, she said something to my foster mom. She said, "Mugeni, she's my daughter, "but she'll always be yours as well. So, Mugeni, she have two moms now." Not all people can say that. It was, like, so kind for her to say that nice words to somebody you've never met. So I live in Michigan but I don't like snow. I work in a factory for the automotive industry. I work overtime so that I can send the money to Mom in Africa so they can have a better life. I helped my mom to start a business in Uganda, and then I wanna help to start more businesses over there. As I grow, I'm taking care of my family 'cause I became like a father. He's the one who was gonna do what I'm doing, but I'm doing it for him. It just makes me proud to do it. I learned to be strong when things are hard. I learned from my mom.
