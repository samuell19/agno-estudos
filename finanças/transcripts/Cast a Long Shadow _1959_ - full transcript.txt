Keep your eye on this. You keep your eye on him. Hey. Oh, buenas tardes, senor.Yeah, buenas. No, no, I'm looking for a fella named Brown. Matt Brown? SenorBrown? He's staying here?Men come, men go. I cannot remember names.He's young, about 23 years old or thereabouts. Not very heavy, pretty well-built. Oh, that one is in the cantina. He's a bad one, senor. He owes me almost a hundred pesos. Oh. Oh, heck. Don't hold your cards like that, boy. I can hardly see 'em, and if I can't see 'em, how can I bring you luck? Open for a peso. Why don't you shoot first? Raise 'em, boy. Up a peso. That's the stuff. Watch 'em fold now. It's too rich for their blood. Why don't you shut up? Up five. I'm out. Out. Call. MAN 1: Call. Two cards. MATT: Here's three. MAN 2: Three to me. Don't sweat it, boy, you'll rub the spots off. Just do like mommy used to say. Spread 'em out and close your eyes. Twenty pesos. Why don't you be subtle and fire a cannon? I don't know what you mean, boy. Deal me out. There's one too many in this game. Hey, wait a minute. Against the wall. Come on. Move. Move. Now, come on, get up. You can ask what hit you later. Hurt bad? Never felt better. You're lucky they didn't kill you. What's the matter with you? You had a bottle, you had a cuspidor, a mess of chairs in easy reach. You fought as if the winner was going to get a medal. Don't you even have a gun? Ate it. Traded it for three weeks room and board. Well, I hope you still own a horse. Same old plug. What brings you down this way, Mr. Donohue? You. I've been looking for you ever since we buried Mr. Keenan. Keenan's dead? Yeah. I thought he was too big to die. Just the thought of him sitting up in that big house is kind of permanent, like the mountains. Yep. When the mountains goes, it leaves quite a hole. You didn't look me up after more than four years to tell me that. No, that's only part of it. Your old man left you everything. Is this some kind of a joke? Would I spend five weeks of my life to play a joke on you? It doesn't make sense. I always figured you'd get the place when the old man died. I didn't think he even knew I was alive. Why did he leave it to me? Don't dig, boy, you'll just break your shovel. If he was your father, he was pretty good at keeping his mouth shut. 87,000 acres. He was a weird one, old J. Keenan. He was as tough as they come, but he didn't smoke, he didn't drink, didn't cuss, was a bug on religion, strict. Remember? I remember how he treated my mother. The old man could never forgive anyone who broke one of the rules he set store by, and your ma was a disgrace to his way of thinking. His way of thinking? Keenan was my father. He was a stinkin' hypocrite and I'm glad he's dead. Do you know what it's like not having a name? It's like being the extra joker in a deck of cards. You're nothing. You don't belong in the game. Oh, well, the point right now is what do you do with your inheritance? I don't know. You see, you can never in a million years run a spread that size. It takes experience and plenty of help from people who respect you. Yeah. Your best bet is to grab the money that some of us scraped up, $20,000. It should keep you drunk a long time. You want to buy it from me? That's right. That's the idea. I didn't have enough cash of my own, so I'm letting some of the others in on shares. How about it? The place really means something to you, doesn't it? You got yourself a deal, Mr. Donohue. Good. But you'll have to go back long enough to sign over the deed and pick up your money. You'll only have to stay there about an hour. What's the matter? Somebody there you don't want to see? All right. I can go straight onto Santa Fe from there. Once you sign those papers, nobody cares where you go, what you do. I'll get my horse. [SNORTING] HUGH: Saddle up tight, Chip. Sunday. Sunday? I thought it was Thursday. I've lost track.Yeah, I wish I could. I hate Sundays. Nothing to do but stand around on one leg. Which is what you do all week anyway. Well, I ain't one to kill myself. I don't see no point to it. Listen, the man's his own boss. Hello, son. Hello.Glad to see you. Are you? You've been gone quite a spell. Folks was beginning to wonder. Almost everybody is in church. Go get Charlie Boles. I'll need him to open up the safe. Boles ain't here, Chip.Well, where is he? Well, he left yesterday to go fishing up at the creek. He would. That's a good three-hour ride. You go get him. I'm sorry, kid. This will give you time to clean up and rest a bit. You can wait over as Hortensia's. She'll fix you some breakfast. I'll look after the horses. Well? The quicker we open that safe, the quicker you get a piece of this place. I'll send my boy on the fastest horse I got. The place is closed. There's no more whiskey. Ay,last night. [SPEAKING SPANISH] They drank everything and broke the furniture, and they sang about their mothers until they got sick. Hello, Hortensia. I tell you, there is no more... Matt. Oh, dios mio,Matt. [QUESTIONING IN SPANISH] I was sure you were dead. Well, not exactly.But you never wrote. Nothing to say. Hortensia, what do you think about all this? Think? What is there to think? The old man died. He had no people. He left everything to you. I thought you at least were my friend. I am your friend, querido, but to hear what you want to hear, you would have to ask the old man, and he's dead. Come. Sit down. I will get you some food. I'm not hungry. Then a drink. I was lying. There is whiskey, a little. No, thanks, Tensia. Matt. Look, Matt, tell me. Like everyone else I am... Como se dice? I am anxious to know what you have decided. I'm selling. Clearing out of here as fast as I can. I thought perhaps you had had enough of running away. Ever since I rode through that front gate, it's been coming back. But that is passed. You and Janet? What about her? I changed my mind. I think I'll have that drink. Si.

Now, that singing is just one more proof that there hasn't been any harmony of any kind on this place since Mr. Keenan died. Amen to that. Now, I'm no great shakes as a preacher, but a congregation like this gets no better than it deserves. I know what's in all your hearts and minds. You're dreaming of the day that Chip gets back and tells us that this place is ours. [ALL MURMURING] My question is, do we deserve this place? What have we done since the funeral? I've see nothing but drinking, loafing, and general hell-raising. Amen. Is this the way you're gonna act when you become your own bosses? Excuse me, folks, but, uh, I, uh... I figured you'd all be wanting to know, Chip's back. [ALL CHATTERING] He's got young Matt with him. HARRISON: Well, get on with it, Hugh. Well, my boy is heading out to the creek to fetch Charlie Boles. Seems we bought us a ranch! [ALL CHEERING] Thirty years workin' for the other fella, and now this place is mine. Hey, you old squarehead, you've got a measly 60th. I got a full 50th. I'll thank you to call me sir now. We've got to celebrate. Let's have us a barbecue. Sure, and while we're waiting, we can have ourselves a dance. Is that all right with you, Eth?Sure. Well, how come you ain't hollered amen? Oh, isn't it wonderful? I prayed so for this. I only hope we're equal to it. Don't you understand, Ma? Matt's selling us the place. We don't take orders from nobody now. You'll take orders from me Dick Calvert. Oh, sure, Ma, but the land we work will belong to us. It took Mr. Keenan a whole lifetime to build this place up into what it is. It wasn't meant for one man to have so much. Well, if Mr. Keenan had wanted this place split up 40 different ways, it seems to me like he would have done it himself instead of leaving the whole thing to Matt. Ma, we don't care what Mr. Keenan wants. He's dead. As for Matt Brown, he ain't got the brains of a muley cow. What could he do with a ranch like this? Just what he did. Sell it to us.Right. Now come on, Ma. Let's go along home. You know they're counting on you to make the potato salad for the barbecue. Janet, you go home and put on that nice yellow silk dress, I might just take the notion to dance with you. Take your hands off me, Sam Mullen. I sure like that yellow dress. Why, you could even get hay on it. Nobody'd know. What's your hurry? I have work to do. You never have work to do unless you're sore at me. What have I done? Nothing. I haven't been back long enough. What's on your mind? Matt. Oh, what's the long face for? For him? He's getting what he wants. We're getting what we want. The land. This is all you want? Hortensia, I spent 30 years of my life working this place for another man. I finally got a piece of it to call my own. Doesn't that make you happy for old Chip? You know what I want for you. What would make me happy. Don't let me keep you from your work. Well, Matthew, I just heard you were back, boy. I hurried right over. Did you?Why, certainly. I wanted to congratulate you, son. You can't imagine how pleased I am and how worried I've been, not knowing where you were. That's hardly a decent way to treat your only kinfolks, huh? Well, maybe I didn't see that candle burning in your window. Get out of here. What'd you say? You heard me, Uncle Eth. You smell a little money, and you start acting awful high and mighty. It seems to me like you're the one that's on the sent of some cash. I remember all the sermons you preached to me while you were picking my pocket. It makes me sick in my stomach. You got a lot of gall talking to me that way. Well, that's the thanks I get for taking you under my roof after your mother disgraced me. You better get out of here. All right, boy. I'm getting. But I fed and clothed you for a long time before you started earning your keep. I figured that rich father of yours, Mr. Keenan, should have put out for that. Now that you've coming into all this money, I aim to be paid. [DOOR CLOSING] Ma loves a barbecue.Hmm. Gives her an excuse to make potato salad. Ah! Keep your fingers out of that. That's right. And see that you don't use it as an excuse to get drunk. Lately, Dick hasn't needed an excuse. If there's a jug around, I'm man enough to take my share of it. Well, since you've been running with that Mullen, there always seems to be a jug around. And your share of it gets bigger and bigger. I don't know why you two got it in for Sam. He's a good fella. And he's sure partial to Janet. I think she's a fool to hold him off the way she does. Lucky a man like Sam is interested in her after all the talk about her and Matt Brown. Now you quit pestering your sister. She'll get married in her own good time and to a man of her own choosing. About ready, Sis? Janet? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Come on. Shake a leg. We're about ready. I'm not going. What's ailing you? Oh, nothing. Then why aren't you dressed? You go on ahead. I--I feel a little tired. I'll be over later. What's the matter? You got him on your mind? I don't know what you're talking about. You don't, huh? Sis, he isn't our kind. No, and I ain't letting any kinfolk of mine take up with him. KEN: Wasn't there enough talk? Why can't you leave me alone? We'll leave you alone, but you stay in the house, see? Just till sundown. He'll be gone by then. Moaning around like this. He must have done more to you than tip his hat. Get out! Maybe folks is right. Maybe you ain't fit to marry. Get out of here with your dirty mind. Come on, Dick, leave her be. All right. All right. We'll go. But you stay put. And he better stay put or when he checks out here tonight, he won't need that money. [SOBBING] Matt, I saw you coming over here from my window. Did you? I thought that... Well, maybe we could talk. I think you said everything there was to say the last time we talked. That was a long time ago, Matt. I was only 17. You seemed to know what you wanted or didn't want. A girl, when she's that young... Well, certain things are more important to her than they are later. True. It's only natural that before you buy a mule you look at his teeth and check his bloodline. If he doesn't pull when the whip is cracked, he's only worth his weight in glue. You're not making this very easy. Why don't you leave me alone? I'm no different now than I was four years ago when you refused to marry me, except now I've got a little money. Forget I said that. It's all right. I know you didn't mean it. Matt, I gave you my reasons for saying no. I was honest with you, I didn't hold anything back. Except yourself. Yeah, but nobody around here believes that. Ever since you left... Never mind. What do you want from me? A certificate? I don't know why I keep trying to hurt you, Janet. I guess it's because everything you have accused me of is true. I'm a freak of nature. I haven't the most ordinary thing in the world, a last name. You would die laughing if you knew why I came up here. I do know. I thought I could pull old man Keenan out of his grave and find out the truth. And have you?Sure. With all his Bible quoting, he had a temper like thunder and lightening. Even an old gunslinger like Chip Donohue used to knuckle under to him. But me? No thunder and lightening in me, just hot air and maybe a little whiskey. Matt, he left you everything. No, he didn't. He only left me what he didn't need. But he wanted...Look, if I was his son, would I come sneaking around this house like a servant? No, I'd throw open those shutters, sit in that chair, I'd buckle on this gun belt, and I'd throw anyone off the place who didn't call me Mr. Keenan. Then why don't you? Stay, Matt, this place is yours. Words on a piece of paper don't make it mine. To hold a place like this together, people have to respect you, look up to you. Make them respect you. How? You could, Matt. You could be as big as Keenan and bigger. Matt, listen. When you were gone, lots of things changed. I quit caring what other people think. I was only afraid I'd never see you again. Matt, I've gone over it with myself a hundred times, and I know now I had no right to refuse you when I felt the way I did because it doesn't matter who you are or what you do. The important thing is that... Is that you have a feeling for someone and that it's warm and strong and growing and you can't let it die because then you die. Matt, I was a girl, now I'm a woman. And whether you go away or stay tonight, I'm with you.

You better put it away, though, before you hit one of those kids. That's all for me. We better go back to drinking. What you guys need is a shotgun. WADE: This is what I call a picnic. DICK: That's what it is. WADE: Fill me up again.SAM: Give me some more of that rotten... Hey, that was pretty fine shooting, Sam. Oh, you haven't seen nothing yet.Give me a drink. Put the guns up, boys. Well, look who's here, the top gun. Come on, Donohue, let's see how good you are. I see one more hand touch one more jug, there may not be a jug and there may not be a hand. What put the burr under your saddle? These letters coming from the bank of Santa Fe when I was out chasing after Matt. They're getting a little edgy for the money?Edgy? Worse than edgy. Seems there's new management, Chicago fellas, and they're real upset that the loan on this place has gotten so big and extended so long. We talked this out before you left. Sure. You figured that we'd pay off the loan with the cattle that we sold. The trouble is that this last letter says we pay by the 16th of this month or the bank takes the ranch. Sixteenth? That's Saturday. We can't pay without selling the cattle, and we can't get the cattle to Santa Fe by then. Maybe if some of us went to 'em and asked 'em for an extension, The letter rules it out. Read it for yourself. Instead of hoofing it up here because you're in business for yourselves, my thinking is you better all get to work. You mean try to get 3,000 head of cattle to Santa Fe by Saturday? That's the size of it. Wade, you start getting a chuck wagon supplied. The rest of us will begin rounding up the steers. You mean right now? We'll have to push them across the flats as it is. There's no time to take 'em the easy way around. Go it slow, Calvert. Stay where you are. Ken, you're Janet's older brother, so it's you I've got to speak to about marrying her. I love her, I can support her, and I guess that's about all that's any of your business. Mr. Harrison, can you perform the ceremony? Well, now, son, I ain't no real preacher. Nearest one I know of is in Santa Fe. Well, I can say a few words, but it wouldn't be too legal. No, I need a license for a wedding. How about a funeral? I'd hoped there wouldn't be any trouble, Dick, 'cause to stop this you'll have to use your gun. Keep out of this, Dick. It's me he's talking to. Then handle it. Matt, I declare you did decide to come to the party. Hello, Mrs. Calvert. Oh, if Mr. Keenan could only have lived to see you again. I don't know how many times he said to me, "Charlotte, where do you think that boy has taken himself?" Ma.Hmm? Matt's asked me to marry him, and I've said yes. Oh, honey, I couldn't be more pleased. That's wonderful, just wonderful. Matt, I always did favor you for Janet. I'll try to make her happy. Come on, Ken, you come with me. You too, Dick. There's a lot of cleaning up to be done before you start rounding up any cattle. Janet, now tell me true. You ain't really fixing to marry up with him, are you? We got packing to do, Janet. SAM: How can any gal marry him? I mean, how's a preacher supposed to hitch you two? Woman's supposed to take a man's name when she marries him. What happens when he ain't got a name to give her? You're going to take Janet's name maybe? [ALL LAUGHING] Mr. and Mrs. Janet Calvert. Matt, please stop. [EXCLAIMS] Leave him alone. Let go of him. Matt, he's got a gun! [GUN FIRING] Mullen, don't you ever pull a trick like that again. There's still papers to be signed, remember? You go back to Hortensia's, kid. She'll help you clean up those cuts. Oh, Matt, why'd you do it? He's hurt you bad.I'm all right. Let me tell you. Nothing else would have pulled me away from my fishing, Donohue. I was at... What's going on here?Never mind that. I want you to open the safe. We've kept young Matt here waiting long enough for his money. Oh, sure, sure. Just a minute, Boles. You're to open that safe and give every man here his money back. [ALL CHATTERING] You people, gouging me with one hand, shoving a pin at me with the other so I'll sign this place over to you. Well, I won't sign anything that will give you one square acre in hell. Now, listen here, Matt...No, Boles, you listen to me. You and all the rest of you. This is my place. I'm walking into that house, my house, and I'm going to sit behind that desk, and I'm going to run this place. You don't want to work for me, you can clear out now. You won't be missed. You're fired, Mullen. You've got an hour to get off my place. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] It don't look like I'll want for company when I go. One hour. Kid, don't rush off. We better talk this out.I said my say. Now it's your turn to listen. I've had a belly full of listening to this crowd. You mean to spend your life making us listen to you. You think all there is to owning this place is living in that house, sitting behind a desk, yelling orders at people you don't like? What do you know about running a ranch like this? I'll learn. Well, you won't have a chance. That sounds like a threat. It's a simple fact. Come Saturday, this ranch won't even be yours. It will belong to the bank in Santa Fe. Tell him, Boles. Before he died, the old man got pretty deep in debt. He sank all his cash into more land. He had to keep borrowing to meet the payrolls, and that's the truth. These loans are overdue, kid. Unless we can deliver 3,000 head of cattle into Santa Fe by this Saturday, the bank takes over. Why didn't you tell me this before? As long as you were selling, it wasn't your headache. You just offered me $20,000 for this ranch. You still on? Then you think it can be saved? Yeah, it'll take a lot of sweat to get a herd through to Santa Fe in time, but if every man here had a stake, it'd be worth it. Every man here does have a stake. His job and his home. We'll have 3,000 head ready to move at sun-up tomorrow. You men can start rounding up the cattle right now. All right, it's your choice. You either take orders from me or clear off my place same as Mullen. You can't bluff me. I had nothing when Donohue found me. If I don't get the herd to Santa Fe in time, I won't be any worse off than I've been all my life. Hugh, you can't ask me and the kids to start over in a new place now. Hugh, you can't. All right. I'll work the east pasture. [PEOPLE MURMURING] Wait for me. I'm going with you. MATT: Just a minute. Leave the jug here. I'd like a drink as well as any of you, better than some, but till I get that herd to Santa Fe, there's no room for whiskey in my plans. I'm serving notice right now. I'll fire anyone I catch with a jug or a bottle. Any special orders for me? Rigdon headed for the east pasture. Where are the rest of the cattle? Mostly along the wash. Then you supervise the round-up there. Who's coming with me? What should I do with your money?Keep it a few days. Maybe the new owner will change his mind again. Matt? Come on if you want to talk to me. You should put cold compresses on those bruises. I'm fine. What's the matter? You suddenly seem so different. I feel different. Remember how you told me you'd changed when I was away? Mmm-hmm.Changed from girl to woman. Well, I grew up just now. Down in that grove. You take care of the horses here now? Yes, sir. What's your name? Noah, Noah Pringle. Well, Noah, will you saddle a horse for me? Well, I ain't turned your mare in the corral yet. I'll make you a present of that old boneyard. I want something better. Where's Mr. Keenan's horse? Captain? He's in the stall. Saddle him. Go on, shake a leg, boy. When I had your job, nobody had to tell me twice. Look where I ended up. Yes, sir. Giving orders seems to come easy for you. I took enough of them. What's all this going to do to us, Matt? How do you mean? Well, we were ready to leave this place and get married. Do you think I'd let anything change that? We'll get married in Santa Fe. Santa Fe? Sure. Come on the drive with us. After we've delivered the cattle, we'll find ourselves a minister, and when we come back here, it'll be as man and wife. I don't know, Matt. Maybe we ought to wait till... Now who's changing her mind? Don't give me arguments, just get yourself packed, all right? I'll be ready. Ease 'em! Ease 'em down, boy! Ease 'em! I've chewed dust till my jaws ached. Well, we've done three days' work in an afternoon. I figure we've earned a little reward. It don't look like you took the boss much at his word. I'm working for him to please my missus. I ain't changing my habits. You're fired, Rigdon. Oh, wait a minute. Y'all had your warning. But Hugh here has been working hard all afternoon and he... Save your breath. I couldn't have stomached him all the way to Santa Fe even if I stayed drunk. Come on. Now get those cattle moving, unless you want to join Rigdon. [MEN URGING CATTLE] Janet? Matt, I know it's late, but I had to talk with you. Hey, I was just thinking about you. You're going to be proud to be my wife, Janet. Oh, I hope so, Matt, that's why...You will be. I've made up my mind to it. You know, Keenan left me all this. He must have had a good reason for it. I'm tired of fretting about what the reason was. The important thing is he left me a big job to do, and I have to measure up to it. I will. I'm promising him, you, and myself. You know, they used to say he'd cast a shadow from here to the main gate. I'm going to cast one, too, through this whole 87,000 acres. Matt...You know what day this is? Sunday, the 10th of July. Matt... [CHUCKLING] It's more than that. It's my birthday. We're going to celebrate this day every year, you and me, starting right now. Aren't you gonna wish me a happy birthday? Matt, I just left the Rigdons'. Are you all packed for Santa Fe? Why did you fire Hugh Rigdon? Because he was drinking. He took one drink. Which leads to the second and the third and so on. You know I can't risk taking any drunk on this drive. There's too much at stake. Give him another chance. I won't back down. It's not only Hugh. It's his wife, the children. He should have thought of them when he opened that bottle. You've made your point. You can afford to be generous now. I fired him, and it stands. I don't want to talk about it. No. No, you'd rather talk about what a big man you are now. Well, I preferred you the way you used to be. When I was nobody? Who are you now? Matt, I want to be proud of you, of what you do, but I can't be if you think that to be a big man, you have to throw away all the qualities I loved in you before. All right, you found out that you've got the power here, you've got the strength to use it, but it takes more than that. Don't lose your gentleness, Matt. Don't feel that it's weak to show mercy. Gentleness? Mercy? Who in this place ever treated my mother gently? Who ever showed her or me any mercy? Is that all this means to you? A chance to get even? Janet, I don't want to fight with you. Now, let's forget Rigdon. It's not that easy for me. You talk about how you've grown, what a great, big shadow you're going to cast. Matt, you're getting smaller. Because I fired a drunk? I'm not going with you to Santa Fe. Why not? I agreed to marry the Matt Brown who took my hand and walked me to the grove. Maybe he was small and frightened, but I knew him and I loved him. I don't know what's happened to him now. Now, you listen to me, you can't... I'm not rushing off to Santa Fe to marry a stranger. You're talking crazy. Look, I'm not going, Matt. That's final. Let's wait. Let's just wait and see what a great, big man you get to be because at the rate you're going, in a month's time you'd be ashamed to be married to a little nobody like me. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Do you mind if I sit with you? Ease in. Thought you'd be with your wealthy nephew. Oh, the way that boy's been behaving since he got back, I'm ashamed of being his blood relative. You got my sympathy, Hugh. Thanks. Every man of us here watered this place with the sweat of our brow. We all looked forward to the day we could claim a piece of it as our own. Now along comes this nobody who kicks us all off. Have a drink. Well, thanks. I don't mind if I do. Nothing wrong in having a little drink. Even the Good Book says to take a little wine for thy stomach's sake. That takes a load off my mind. You know, I just realized the four of us right here at this table got more reason than most to hate Matt Brown. Wish I'd killed him this afternoon while I had a chance. I would have, too, if Donohue hadn't have butted in. I bet he wishes now he hadn't. Oh, it's too bad Donohue didn't find that boy dead. ETH: Wouldn't be having the problems we have now. How do you mean? Well, I'm his only living relative, Hugh. Well, how would that help us? Well, with Matt dead, I'd own this place. I wouldn't have been greedy. I'd have taken, say, half the money, kept an interest of 10%. What good does this kind of talk do us? He ain't dead. That's right. He ain't. That's too bad. Yeah, that is too bad. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [CHATTERING STOPS] No more drinks, Hortensia. You're closed for the night. You men better sleep while you can. You won't have much chance between here and Santa Fe. You were told to clear off, Mullen. My friends here think I should stay. Get your friends out with you. [GLASS BREAKING] Why are you mixing in this again? I thought this was an open fight. Did I ask for help? I just didn't want to see any more of Hortensia's glasses busted. But if Mullen and his friends want to stop you outside, I won't raise a hand. I said, no more drinks. Oh, have a drink with him, Matt. To the success of the drive. I gave an order. I expect any man that works for me to obey it. You know, it's not what you say that galls me. It's the way you say it. You'll get used to it. The question is, do I want to? You know, when a man works the same job too long, he gets to thinking no one else can do it. I guess that makes him as big a fool as the boy who thinks if he gives enough orders, nobody will have time enough to know that most of them don't make sense. As my foreman, Donohue, you'll take my orders or you're finished. That's plain enough. Pick up your money from Boles in the morning. Oh, no, Matt. Keep out of it. Good luck, kid. You forced him to do it. Why? I should have quit this job a long time ago. I can't understand why on earth you changed your mind. Everything all packed and then you say you're not going. You can still go, honey. He wants you with him. Aren't you going with him? He decided he could manage without me. But he can't. You know he can't. Janet, he doesn't set much store by what I know. He'd never make it without you. Why'd you let him push you away? Why did you? [MOOING] All right. Let's move 'em out. There'll be plenty of time to talk after we get to Santa Fe. Our cattle, boys. Move quietly and keep out of sight. So, you're really going? That's right. Nothing to keep me here. When I locate, I'll drop you a line. No, querido. You will try to forget this place. But if you could, where would that leave you? You say there is nothing here to keep you. I think when you go, you leave behind more than you take with you. You're a good woman, Hortensia, but you talk too much. Do not run away. I'm not running. I was fired, remember? Because you wanted to be. Oh, Chip, if you go now, for the rest of your life you must live alone with your old fear. I don't know what you're talking about. You were afraid of Keenan. I hated him. No, no, you were afraid of him because he knew you so well. Because in him there was no mercy, no forgiveness. So? I don't look to him for anything now. But he still punishes you. Even from the grave he punishes you. For 30 years he let you think this place would someday be yours. For 30 years you lived in fear, lived his way, just to get this ranch. And when he dies, he leaves it to the boy. Then let the boy have it. I'm not asking him for anything. Then give him what you can, what you owe to him. You expect me to stay here and help the boy keep what's mine by rights? For your sake, not for Matt's. He's young and strong. But not weak like you, querido. Run. Run from the truth as you always have. You cannot get away from it. You are weak, weak. You're the weakest man I have ever known. Get back. Come on, get back. [URGES MULE] Come on! Get back there. [MOOING] [URGING CATTLE] Tell the boys we'll hold it up here for an hour and let them graze. [URGING HORSE] Looks like he's going to let 'em graze as long as he can. There won't be much grass or water by tomorrow. And the day after that, they'll be on the flats. Some of 'em will. Who's that? It's Donohue. I thought he tossed in his cards. Looks like he's trying to deal himself in again. Have some jerky? No, thanks. It takes more than nerve to run a drive like this. I'm not hungry. You made good time. What's on your mind? I guess I was hasty-tempered last night. You asking me to give you another chance? Yup. All right. I could use another hand. Donohue, when we start, you'll ride drag. Whatever you say. Well, we might just get these critters to Santa Fe after all. 'Cause Donohue joined the party? He knows the trail. He knows how to baby 'em across them flats out there. He came because he's as sure as the rest of you I'm going to fall flat on my face. He wants to be standing where he can laugh loud and kick dust on me. And maybe he will, but he's going to eat his pack of dust first. [MEN WHISTLING] [URGING CATTLE] [HORSE NEIGHING] Now, we'll have a cup of good coffee. You think we got a chance of getting to Santa Fe with those critters? It's not my job to think. Anyway, I got too much dust in the brain. Matt called the turns pretty smart today. That don't mean much. Noah could trail boss this first part. The flats will be the test. That's no mistake. Cattle will get edgy out there even when they aren't being rushed. A man so much as breathes heavy, it can stampede 'em. The boss will just order us to quit breathing. I'd feel better if you were riding point, Chip. CHIP: Nope, it's his gamble. Let him call the plays. I got your bedroll from the wagon. Thanks. I'm afraid I wasn't much help today. You'll learn. Well, thanks for giving me the chance. Noah? Yes, sir? Maybe you better keep your eye on the night string. Yes, sir. [NEIGHING] [HORSES SNORTING] Oh, whoa, boy. Try to cut 'em off, or they'll stampede the cattle. Right. Get 'em back on the picket line and I'll check the herd. Here you are, Chip. That was a close one. All quiet. Here. Thanks. Anybody know what set 'em off? I didn't hear a thing till they started bellowing. NOAH: Let go! Let me go. How was I to know? No one told me. What's the matter? Tell him. I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. But you got to believe me. I didn't mean no harm, honest. What'd he do?This is what started it. A wolf's skin. We're lucky the herd isn't halfway to Texas. I was carrying it in my bedroll. I thought I might get a couple of dollars for it in Santa Fe. You risked all our necks for a couple of bucks? All right. That's enough. Noah made a mistake, and he's sorry. It didn't cost us anything but a lot of hard riding, so let's forget it. You got any other surprises in that bedroll? No, sir. Somebody get rid of that thing. [MOOING] [MEN URGING CATTLE] The flats are just on the other side of that hill. I think I'll ride on and have a look. They're camping down on the flats. Those cattle are going to be good and nervous after a day with no graze and not much water. Then we move in, fire a couple of shots. And stand clear. Those steer is gonna move out like a railroad train. And when everybody is busy trying to head 'em off, Matt's gonna meet up with an accident. Oh, hold on, Mullen. When I threw in with you, I didn't bargain for no accident. Just count me out. Look, you're in this, and you're gonna stay in. Now you understand that. By the time those cattle get through tromping on Matt, nobody's gonna notice he was shot. [MOOING] It's going to be a noisy night. Yeah. Matt's been gone a long spell. Maybe he quit on us. Not him. He hasn't been off that horse since sun-up. Yeah, he don't spare himself. You got to give him that. [SNORTS] Who gave the order to stop? I did. It was getting dark and you weren't back yet, so I thought... All right, all right. Finish your grub and coffee, and then I want this herd moving. You ain't thinking of moving this herd out on to those flats tonight? Why, you don't know what it's like to be... I know how far we've come in two days and how far we've got to go. We won't make it unless we do some night-driving. You can't expect us to work without no sleep. Any man wants his job with me better be in his saddle in 10 minutes. I'd like a word with you. You got anything to say, say it. You know, night-drives across these flats always end up the same, in a stampede. I have to risk that. I know you're fighting for time, but this isn't the place to speed up the drive. You go out there tonight and you'll be lucky if you don't lose half your herd and a man or two besides. If you're afraid, stay here. Sometimes it's smart to be afraid. You're making a mistake. You're in my way. If you're just half as big a man as you want us to think you are, you'll admit you're wrong before there's any damage done. My order stands. You'll lose these cattle and the ranch, even kill some of the men before you back down, huh? I started this drive without you, and I'll finish the same way. Now, what are you waiting for? Eat and get moving. They don't like taking orders when the trail boss is drunk, not on honest whiskey, but the taste of having his own way. You're fired. You can just fire all of us. A man like you doesn't need help from ordinary people. You want the rest of them to leave me. That's why you followed me. I followed you to try to keep you from pulling a foolish stunt like this. I don't need any broken-down saddle tramp telling me what to do. I make my own decisions. These are my cattle. The ranch is mine. Only because the old man wanted to play God and punish me from the grave. His leaving me the ranch has nothing to do with you. Didn't it? I'm his son and I'll tromp down you or anyone else who tries to take what he left me. You're not Keenan's son. You're my son. I'm your father. And any strength in your guts comes from me. You... [NEIGHING] [GUNS FIRING] [MOOING] Stampede! [URGING CATTLE] [EXCLAIMS] My arm. I think it's busted. Mullen! Shoot, and I'll kill you. I thought you wanted to kill me. I did, for a while. Now, let me have a look at that arm. Yeah. Well, I guess this should convince you you don't need to stand on Keenan's shoulders or anyone else's. You cast a mighty long shadow of your own. I guess I'll manage, as long as I've got you and Janet riding herd on me.
