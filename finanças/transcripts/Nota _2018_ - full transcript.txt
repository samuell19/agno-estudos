[siren] They are going to catch us and slam drunk and drive charges on us! Varun, wouldn't they leave us if you ugive them your details? As if you dont know he'll never use his dad's name whatever the hassle? -Speed up, Varun. -We're so gone if we get caught! -Someone is trying to trap us. -Why are so many cars hounding us? It's like they are chasing us for an Encounter? -Stop! -Go, fast! Now I get it. They are behind someone else. We are caught between them like in the movies. -You pull over and let them pass. -Are you sure? Dude, haven't we seen this in so many films? Trust me. -Give way to them. -Okay Varun Swerve to the left and stop Okay move on guys. How can we pass if they park in front of us? Oh god! They were following us all along, idiot! Okay, this ain't new to us. I can manage it easily. Are you new to this job? Don't you know whose car it is? Whatever it is, you can talk to me. I won't leave you just like that. I know that! You expect a bribe as usual! Is there a cam here eh? Okay we shall sort it out over there. Please fine us sir. We don't have a problem with that. My license- Sir, we know who you are. We didn't stop you for drunken driving. I'm Asst. Commissioner Ravindra. The Inspector General wanted to speak to you urgently. That's why we stopped you. Sorry for the trouble sir. [phone ringing] Tighten security outside his house, okay? Go ahead. Okay sir. The IG is online sir. -Uncle? -Sorry, Varun I've been ordered to bring you back home at once wherever you are. Uncle, please Today is my birthday I have to drop my friends. This isn't what you think, Varun. It's an emergency. The news is all over the media already. We've been trying to contact you for an hour, but couldn't get through Somehow we traced your whereabouts But you had left from there by then You don't worry. Our men will drop them home safe and sound. What's the emergency uncle? Will you please explain? Officially, it should sound like sir has told this to you and not me. Okay, tell me That isn't right, sir You are the new CM of the state as tomorrow dawns. Are you joking? Varun, am I mad to chase you in the middle of the night to crack jokes? Please co-operate and allow me to complete my duty. What happened Varun? Is everything fine? Thank you sir. Please get down We'll drop you Suresh, take this jeep and drop all of them. 'I accept, sir, I shouldn't have grabbed you by the collar' 'And that too with a beer bottle' Please forgive me just this once [overlap of voices] Just a question sir. Oye! Haven't slept yet? Happy birthday bro! I don't understand what's happening here. [giggles] I heard they are escorting you to the Governor's residence Have all of them gone bonkers? I've been living in London to avoid all these hassles. I don't even remember when I last spoke to dad. Don't even know who is the present Governor here. Even now I come once a year only for you and for the kids in the orphanage. What's with this man? Has he lost it suddenly? In your daily 'Yuva Telengana' ...you've been regularly criticizing and writing articles on CM Vasudev There are even cases filed against you on this 'Do I have any 'give and take' money dispute with the CM?' 'Whatever his deeds as the chief minister. I'm reviewing them as a reporter. That's it' What is your opinion on his announcement all of a sudden? Oh! He's been giving many such shocks to the people repeatedly. Nowadays, it's a fashon to declare things at midnight. But... this seems to be a new shock that was never in the list! He has called for a press meet in a while Wonder what cock and bull story he'll cook up then! [phone ringing]Is it right to take sudden decisions? -We strongly disagree. -I've got to take this call. -I'll be back.-Allow me to speak, sir. Our leader's decision must be for the good of the people Mahendra sir, this is Varun here Hello, my dear chief minister. Congratulations! Sir, you know everything and even you are taking a dig at me? I ought to be in London in a couple of days for an important project What is happening here actually? The news so far is only about a press meet. We don't know what's next. Just go with the flow. Don't get tensed now. Okay sir. Tomorrow's orphanage plan is cancelled then. Can you take care of that? I know son. Poor kids! As usual they had prepared programmes for your birthday They will be disappointed with your absence. But I'll manage somehow. Call me if there is anything important. Okay, sir. [people chattering] It has started bro. Come. Come fast. [people chattering] Call whoever told you this. I'll also join Okay, you go. Okay. To facilitate a common man a travel like the weathy ones... ...in luxury buses across the state or country And to provide chilled Air conditioning to them too Our government introduced the luxury bus project Because of that project... ...fearing that our party and government might get the laurels of the people ...some anti socials have filed a case against us Tell me If can elaborate further when the case is being considered by the court? I can't even give my opinion But I am sure justice is on my side and that's true. If you are so sure, why are you resigning your post as chief minister? Let us assume the court declares me as not guilty. Then what will my friends from the Opposition say? They would say he misused his position as chief minister... ...and got the verdict in his favor. I shouldn't gain such an ill repute. That's why, taking moral responsibility, I'm resigning my post as chief minister 'Even then aren't you selecting your son who has no prior political experience?' Who is that? Turn that a little... VNN... I assumed. Madam, your channel supports the opposition You have no choice but to ask their questions! Only then you'll get paid! Still I'll answer your query My son Mr Varun didn't jump from the sky. I didn't force him to enter politics 5 years He has been heading the Youth Wing for the past 5 years and serving the people Mr Varun, do you know the meaning of 'Youth Wing'? 'He has been talking steps towards politics' Let me tell you something I did not decide Varun should step in Millions of volunteers... ...and members have decided it unanimously. I'm bound to their love. Why should people suffer for your love? Is it a Chief Minister post or a game of musical chairs? A man with no political experience or held no post till now Why should he be forcefully given such a post? -Isn't that Mahendra sir's daughter?-'Just because you don't know it...' -...saying Varun is inexperienced is wrong. -He is so fond of me -and this girl is defaming me.-All the people of the state know this. Without any recommendation... -She's getting prettier by the day.-...he has got a seat in a top university. He runs an orphanage in his mother's name Whichever corner of the world he is in he comes running for its programs Age is not a criteria for a leader How old was Vivekananda? Sitarama Raju our freedom fighter? Take the example of Varadarajulu, leader of the opposition party Sir, aren't you a senior reporter? -What is the post his daughter holds? -She heads the Women's Wing Why don't you question our Opposition leaders? You won't! Last question please? Why didn't Mr Varun attend this meeting? A word for your volunteers, sir? My humble request to my millions of volunteers and fans I've got news that some of you claimed to sacrifice your lives if I resign. Party might pay 5 lakh rupees if someone sacrifices their lives. You shouldn't sacrifice your life for that money This is a test I must go through. Only I should prove my sincerity. I'll come back, so kindly keep your precious lives to welcome me back Thank you [people cheering] Can I come in? Sir asked me to tie this 'lungi' to you What? A lungi? Please don't worry sir. If I tie this 'lungi' on you and tie a belt in the right way... ...even if anyone grabs it in a fight it won't strip off you! Strip it off me? What are you talking? You should tightly hold on to your 'lungi' in politics sir. Because they can strip it off you any second. -This won't work for me. -Please try it just once. -Please listen to me. -Then you'll hold on to it forever. Variety Star Vasudev who has acted in more than 100 films.. ...has suddenly resigned his post after 15 years of political journey and appointed his son as chief minister This has come as a complete surprise to the people. Varun is the son of Vasudev's 1st wife Chithra As Chitra passed away when Varun was an year old, Vasudev married Kausalya Their daughter is Narmada [overlap of voices] Why has he not chosen you despite your experience? Memes saying no surprise if Mr. Vasudev makes this young girl the chief minister are doing rounds on social media -Narmada. Where is Varun? -He is in the training upstairs, uncle. -Training? '-Das! -Coming sir!' -Please tighten it -Okay -Please lift your shirt -Son! Your new attire is awesome! Uncle, you've been with dad since his film days If he had wanted someone temporarily for that post... ...why couldn't you you take it yourself? Otherwise if he had wanted a dumb fellow ...he could've made this moustached Das bro as CM too -Don't make fun of me -What do you say? -Why is your leader dragging me into this? -Son... -You know your dad too well. -It's secure now If he takes a decision, no one can change his mind Do you think we didn't discuss this with him? The entire party tried to convince him for a week Ever since he returned from that 'ashram' last week he's on a single track Ashram? [laughs] You mean that monk's ashram? [laughs] Is the future of a State in the hands of a god-man? Well done you bloody politicians. My dear boy, your father trusts him Important decisions are made only on his advice You and I can't do anything about it The judgment is due in 1 or 2 weeks It will definitely be in his favor Until then we'll make sure you won't face troubles, okay? Please come Praise be to Allah! How long have you been in politics, uncle? Maybe around 25 years Based on your experience please tell me Don't you think all of this is stupidity? 'Hey! Which town, man?' Is it really self immolation or your is it a drama with a dead body, huh? Lunatics! Why didn't you announce a condolence? I already announced I'll give Rs 500,000 My signature isn't needed. Just use my seal. I am going to the Governor's place now. Forget it Sundaram At least let half the amount reach the family of the deceased -Bhai, have you briefed him? -Told him everyhting sir. Listen, put your usual habits at bay for some days. Don't go painting the town red with chicks. Your revelry last night is already telecasted in a TV channel. Junk of a fellow! After the swearing in, go straight to your room Everything you need will come to your room For 2 weeks, you have to be under our supervision If they need your signature, they will come to you. Just sit quiet. -Why doesn't he respond? -Sir. Don't worry. I'll take care of everything. -Shall we leave? -Sir 5 minutes sir. It's too crowded outside. We had to use force to restrain them. -They even pushed the barricades -Get lost! You'll hear cuss words then Swearing in is at 5:00 a.m Hasn't the time been set by Swami ji? Have you cleared the traffic? -Or should I go and say left and right -No sir, we'll do it right now. -Go away. -I'll do it now. What are you waiting for? -Use the full force. Now! -Okay sir. 'Long live our leader!' [siren] No! Crap! What is it? My friends will post memes on Facebook and troll me for sure! Son There's no such culture in politics in olden days But today this culture and politics go hand in hand You think these flex hoardings are for your sake? No boy! The local chap has to show off his proximity to the leader He knows that we won't be able to notice them too at the speed we pass and we know that too. This is political tactics he indulges his followers in Who cares if he erects a flex or his coffin itself? Take it easy. [siren] Come man. Lower it. Namasthe bro. Learn to stand straight. You might sculpt the wrong statue claiming you never saw my face! Come. -Namasthe. -Namasthe. We haven't met. Can I have a word with you? Come. Young man... Legally I must listen to what your father tells me. But do you hae any issue with accepting this post? My dad said it will only be for a short duration Till then I'll be handling it Any portfolio changes, Mr. Vasudev? Er... no sir. Let all the ministers retain their respective portfolios The new CM will be in charge of my portfolio alone. Should all the ministers take their oaths today? No, let the CM and a couple of ministers be sworn in today The rest can do so a few days later, sir 'I, V. Varun, solemnly swear as the chief minister of this State' 'I will faithfully and conscientiously discharge my duties' '...in the presence of god' It's alright please sit down Congratulations young man. Do you know your portfolios? Portfolios? I'm not saying this as the Governor. I'm talking from my experience Look over there Look at your father's coterie They will even stoop to kill to claim this post of yours But it has fallen into your lap like a lollipop Make use of it wisely. You haven't had anything here! -Sir. -Coffe or tea? Er...I haven't got over my hangover of last night. Can I have a glass of buttermilk please? [Humming] "Hey minister! Come let's build a fort with thermocol!" "Hey minister! Isn't the law your relative?" Sir, this is regarding finance. About pension. This is a file of ministers who were sworn in at the Governor's residence 'No, dad I am really curious' How can even a dummy CM be so dumb? It's been 2 weeks since he was sworn in as CM Not even gutsy enough to meet the media. Vasudev draged you into this in the party saying you are my daughter. Are Varun and I equal? He was such a riff raff even in college Wait and watch how I'll tear him to shreds in front of the people What do you think will be the verdict in Vasudev's case? The CBI is conducting it As usual it will lose it. Some of the witnesses in the lower court are dead out of old age now. 'Our new CM has another scheme for the State' Want to know the name? 'Let's drink and dance' To elaborate, so far the Govt has only facilitated boozing in the bars for the people From now on, the Govt will also facilitate drinking with the chief minister! Well said, madam! A father who is entangled in scams and facing trial His precious son who doesn't even know the ABC of politics What's worse, the esteemed Ex-CM is citing me as an example! Can being involved as a volunteer and rising step by step with experience... ...be compared to someone jumping from abroad out of the blue? [cheering] Even in monarchy the prince to be crowned ...was taught horsemanship, archery, laws, logic and many such arts But our precious prince hasn't even cleared his subjects in college She's tearing you to shreds man. She's our college mate, won't she know everything about us? She used to be scrawny like a scarecrow and ordinary then -Now she's an eye candy! -Shut up you! She's pointing out all the flaws and insulting you and you are flirting with her? Shameless! Hello Shilpa, did I ask to be appointed as CM? How can I be held responsible for that then? Her questions are right too. My political knowledge is zero But I know to flick channels! Change to our channel, dude 'Our new chief minister has introduced a novel scheme never seen earlier in India' 'Through this scheme, farmers will be provided free solar pumps' 'Millions of agriculturists will benefit' What, dude? Setting eh? -When did you do all this? -When did I? They will stretch out a file for my signature I do it, that's it. Didn't you see my poplarity in our channel? Then how does it matter what that girl keeps barking about me? Okay Varun. What's the plan in life for both of you? Would you just have a jolly life being jobless? Rags, you tell me Where will you be 10 years from now? If you offer me 2 bottles of beer I wouldn't know where I'll be in the next 10 minutes, let alone a decade! -Useless! -Same to you. Varun, what about you? No idea where I'll be But I know I shouldn't be here! Wherever my dad is won't work for me I should run back to London -Run and then? -I need to get back to work, dear Don't I have my game designing projects? You mean video games? Do you seriously intend to waste such a prestigious post of chief minister? Hello! Varun is CM for just 2 weeks Then we intend to tell his dad to elect you instead Assembly will be shaken seeing you in your shorts. I'll smash your face Superb! You're the one for this. [phone ringing] -I'll clobber you. -Hey! -Ain't it right? -Shut up. Sir, I'm calling from the Governor's office His Excellency wants to talk to you urgently Yeah sure. Sir. -This is Governor Vijay Menon. -Yes sir. I presume you are alone? -Baby... baby. -Hit me istead but don't sing. -Tell me, sir -Stop it! I've got information from Delhi that the situation turned critical now. Before the media gets to know about it... ...it's advisable to take some precautionary measures Secure police protection in sensitive areas Ensure no law & order problems arise. I don't get it. What happened? What's the news from Delhi? CBI court has passed a sentence on Mr. Vasudev considering him guilty. 5 years imprisonment He would be arrested immediately He will be in the Delhi jail till his appeal comes up for hearing I don't know under what circumstances you took up this post But every single decision you take in this situation... ...will affect many lives Please prepare yourself [music] [sobbing] Narmada, ask your mom not to cry Our lawyer says we can appeal in 2-3 days Please don't cry mom. [loud sobs] Sir, Director General of Police Kodhandapani We will face troubles if this is leaked out to the media. There's a likelihood of our party cadres resorting to riots and rampage That's why our governor has cautioned you well in advance Sir, I neither have any idea a bout this nor am I experienced. Please suggest steps to be taken Pre-emptive arrests are possible sir. Individuals we suspect of breaking the law ...can be arrested prior to committing the crime Their names will be listed in the local police stations What are you saying? So do we arrest people from our own party? A law and order problem would arise then. some people are waiting for it Don't worry about anything I just spoke to our lawyer He will obtain permission for us to talk to your father in the next 1 hour I'm flying to Delhi now Before I board the flight, I'll talk to your father and update you Then you can decide. Don't rush into anything This is a very sensitive issue son. -Okay, uncle. Call me in an hour. -Okay. Let's wait for an hour sir. Okay sir. Shaji, tell me - I'm coming now - I'll take leave 1'o clock flight? Okay Ex-chief minister Vasudev has been found guilty... ...and has been sentenced a jail term of 5 years This mean, he not only loses his position as Member of the Legislative Assembly by the Representation of people act [phone ringing] Dad, your phone's ringing. After his jail term, he cannot contest in any election in the next 10 years -Dad! -Coming dear. Without prior political experience his son, the acting chief minister -Hello? -Sir, I'm Varun speaking Yeah Varun. I thought you'll be busy, so didn't call you since two weeks. I just watched the News -Is everything alright? -Don't know, sir Many issues have cropped up now. I really need your help. You know I'll rush to your aid if you need any help But your party men might not like it. Especially your father It's just last week my daughter and I have torn your party to tatters in our magazine 'That's why I'm hesitatin-' Don't think of that, sir Can you come down now? Of course I can, but where to? -To my place -That'll not work. There's a way. You go to the Secretariat now I'll come over and meet you You ought to be there now actually. Okay, sir What happened? I'm leaving Where to? Secretariat -Bharath. -Yes sir. Arrange for a car at the rear, outside the compound. Let our party men and the Press waiting in front be unaware of this Set the route to the Secretariat Sir, that compound wall is- Is what? It's too high. With glass pieces on it. Is that it? I've scaled that wall many times without your knowledge Do as I say, quick 'Release our leader' Don't block the traffic -Hello, is it Jennifer? -Yeeah tell me, madam We closed school at noon fearing a riot here 'All the children have left' Only Julie is waiting for you I took permission from my boss and started as soon as I got the call, teacher I'm caught in a traffic jam because of the commotion I'm in an auto.

Can you send her with him please? Ain't this a trouble? Now do I have to go looking for him? Okay, hang up I'll take care. [music] Hello, Jennifer? Your kid is so stubborn. I found that boy but she is refusing to go with him [chaos]What do you want me to do? Sorry, teacher give the phone to my daughter Wait then. When will you come mom? I'll be a little late, dear.

No, darling, I'm getting delayed to come and pick you up You be a good girl and play in Raghu's house I'll buy a Mickey pencil box for you. Would you buy it for sure? It's a promise, I'll buy it for you. Hello, please send her carefully ma'am. They are creating hell here Madam, I don't think I can take this route -Shall I make an U turn? -Please make it fast, bro. [chaos] "Whose mistake is it and who pays for it?" "What law is this that causes death" "Even if the foxes look at you in hunger" "Don't be scared" Julie, let's get down. Move aside son. Quick!

Following the arrest of ex-CM Mr Vasudev... ...riots and unrest were instigated by his party men throughout the State 'In that melee they have set fire to a Govt bus in the old slum area' Anguished cries of a young girl are heard in the bus that was set alight -This is an exclusive clipping-Where was this, sir? -Is a child trapped inside? -It's in Charminar, Varun Situation is gory Arrange for a meeting with the DGP in Secretariat immediately This wouldn't have happened if I had issued orders to arrest these dogs sir Varun, focus on what to do next I couldn't save a little girl Then what's the point of me running an orphanage? -I must go there immediately-Where? Venue of this incident Varun, doesn't make sens- I'll meet you there, sir Bharath, re-route to Charminar We must go to Charminar, re-route right now. Tighten security everywhere Yes sir [siren] We tried our level best But we couldn't save that poor child Look at the lifeless form of my child I sent her to school this morning. She has been brought bundled like this. Will no one speak up for me? Sir, don't go there. It's too crowded. [woman crying] Oh my darling baby! What sin did this innocent child commit? I want my baby back Look at my daughter sir! I conceived this child after a lot of prayers sir. They've brought her back in ashes. How will I face my husband? Answer me. Why did you sacrifice my baby for the sake of politics? Answer me! Don't just stand there sir. My only child! You took her away from me! I'll perish along with her. Who is responsible for this? -"What is the use?" -Sir? -one minute. -Who is responsible for this? This is done by the ruling party We've got evidence of involvement of the local MLA's son. If you give me a free hand... [phone rings] ...we can take immediate action and control the violence. I spoke to your father. He told us not to lay hands on our party men right now Let the riot continue for 2-3 days He said only then would the public realize our power We've already informed our party men They will issue a statement blaming the opposition party So just ignore this as much as you can Scumbag! Hello son? DGP, do the needful Arrest the offenders whoever they may be How long will it take to control the riots in all the areas? Give us 6 hours, sir We can't afford 6 hours So many lives are at stake Mahendra sir, I want to call for a Press meet That's a right move. If people know the party head is strong, they won't participate in riots Go for a press meet immediately Every person standing here with a mobile is part of the press The press meet is now and here Sir...sir, come here Tell us, sir 'Namaste' everyone -My father -Not that, sir Hey! My father, Vasudev is the leader of the Indian Democratic Party You are aware of the verdict on his case as 'guilty' We respect the court's judgment Our lawyers are doing the needful to get him out of jail But, using this as an excuse ...some scondrels are resorting to plunder and pillage all over the city They set fire to a bus and very unjustly ...a school girl ...a school girl was burnt- A school girl died because of that. Whoever maybe the culprits Whether they are our party men or an MLA or MP holding a political post... ...I've issued orders to shoot them at sight like stray dogs. If I see anyone causing violence anywhere... ...I will close his chapter off. On behalf on my party men this is a challenge Supporters and fans who love Mr Vasudev ...volunteers, representatives of our party including me ...from now till the next 3 days ...in protest of our leader's arrest, we will stay indoors What is that protest done by sitting at home sir? Sit-in protest Sit-in protest. True supporters of Mr Vasudev ...from now on till the next 3 days ...will either stay in their residence or in the party office Violating this if you see anyone stirring a riot... ...kill them on the spot. Remember this 3 days Got that? We will subject ourselves to house arrest for 3 days Chief minister Varun explosive interview Commotion subsided within half hour Did he defy the political protocol? Debate of the Day -That was a superb move -You bet! His intelligent clause was the leader's true volunteers! No one will get involved in riots now Where is our nation heading? Is this how a chief minister speaks? What's wrong with his speech? Haven't the riots stopped in just half an hour? Is it doomsday if he spoke a string of cuss words? The State loses 10 billion with a general strike for 1 day 'hasn't he saved such a huge sum with just 1 interview? He stopped all the riots. Now I'm forced to go to work I don't know about the riots But he's so mind boggling handsome! Madam, what is your take on our new chief minister? New CM? Call him 'Rowdy CM' Star of cricket is M.S. Dhoni star of cinema's is Powerstar Star of politics is our rowdy CM! What is this new pet name? Aren't his predecessors rowdies too? -3+3 = 6 -Rowdy CM makes magic! Icecream cold Rowdy CM bold We won't have food to eat if we don't sell for even 1 day Bless you, rowdy CM' Ain't it unruly? What he did is right It's right. Rowdy CM did the right thing. Rowdy CM is 100% right -Right -Wrong! Rowdy CM is right -It's wrong -Wrong. His decision is right -Wrong move -Right decision I approve What he did is what we need Long live, Rowdy CM He earned a good name with a single press meet. You don't know about him That was just his luck. People will forget all of this He'll do something foolish again and get in troubles. Whatever, dear You made a 'Dummy CM' famous by naming him 'Rowdy CM'. [phone ringing] -Hello -Kalyan I have a job for you [indistinct voices] 'Stop' -Who? -Salim The chemicals you wanted are in this bag Will he be granted bail? Or should I finish him off in jail? You get ready I'll update you tomorrow I'll call you as soon as it's ready [phone ringing] -Tell me dude? -Dude, come out. Where to?Didn't you watch the news? -3 days of sit-in protest -Protest my foot. Use the rear entrance. We are going out. Impossible There are security guards everywhere If I'm caught by the public that's it, kaput I have a lot of pending work Have you slipped into the real CM's shoes? That's your dad's seat dude.

Who are these girls? The one in that corner is Swiss, rest are England and French Leave the French one to me. Wonder what party it is! Varun, let's go, come one! What is this, dude? She knows my name? Do they know I'm CM as well? Looks like you'll blurt it out They aren't even Indians. They don't even know Telugu. Shilpa met them in a party and invited them Varun, video game designer. that's all I told them. Get in. [music] -Hey, you want some beer? -No thank you.

Let's hope for the best. Has bail been granted, sir? Wait please High Court has issued a stay on CBI's punishment So Mr Vasudev can be released immediately he needn't stay in jail until the case comes up for trial Having shed crocodile tears for a child's demise in the morning, Unable to bear that anguish, right after sunset. He drowned himself in alcohol He went on a 'fun and frolic' spree with scantily dressed females. As a woman I'm feeling embarrassed to even elaborate further Is such a man the future of our State? Will such a person think about people's problems? How disgusting! Being such a proficient speaker if you had joined our party 10 years ago We could've formed the Govt by now Peak hours of the internet - 7:00 pm to 9:00 p.m. I'll upload this then [phone ringing] What? What happened? Vasudev has been granted bail Keep this aside for the time being, Let this commotion subside. We shouldn't feed the people with too much information Timing is crucial He has been released He will get out of jail by 10:00 am tomorrow. They'll go straight to the airport from there. What is your plan of action? I've set chemical explosives in this drone This can be operated from a distance of 5 km Since it works through satellite system... ...an ordinary mobile jammer cannot obstruct it Very good Once the job is done... ...your balance amount would come to you in the form of shares to your mobile company. Sir, give me a cigarette Hey! Get in. Idiot! Give me one too I'll clobber you! What do you want? Huh! What? Dancing, huh? Go... get inside Namaste, sir Sorry, sir, I couldn't arrange the western toilet you asked for Only one cell has that facility As you know, sir That minister from Bihar He's in that cell for many months now Sir, everything you asked including cigarettes and mosquito repellant is here. This is from my side. My son's seat -Is it about the school seat? -Yes, sir -Consider it done -Thank you, sir We want water No water in the toilet, sir -Stomach ache -No water Take me to Hyderabad -No water, sir -Take me to Hyderabad [indignant voices] We don't get water in the toilet, sir 'Vasudev' 'You will face problems this year for sure' According to your horoscope Venus moves from the 5th house '...to the 6th' 'If you don't want to get entangled in that problem' '...you must resign your post' 'But for no reason whatsoever...' '...your post should not go beyond your blood relative or your lineage' If you ensure that alone '...you'll come back to your seat regaining your full power' -'Sir?' -Yes, bhai What does Varun know? Is it right to bring him into this? Bhai, in this 20 years of political clout how much would we have earned? This case I've been accused of is the most trivial scam of all Peanuts, just 50 million Didn't swami-ji predict my time isn't favorable? Problems are bound to arise 'The post should be within blood ties' 'You came up with some reason and cancelled the shoot' What about tomorrow? Tomorrow we can cancel the schedule -We can go to Ooty. -Really? Okay let's go. Where did you go? Oh! She's such a pain! Shooting of course. Would I come back from the moon? I just inquired. They said the shooting was cancelled. Which female were you with? A man has a lot of things to do and meet many people. -Should I tell you everything? -So can you do anything? Even I'll go out tomorrow Don't ask me whom I slept with! Mind your words One click of my finger chicks will queue up I married this second hand unnecessarily What did you say? Second hand, huh? As if you married me without any political agenda? You knew everything about me Hey. What's with you now? Didn't you fall for me, got married and have a son? Then what now? You go around with a different female daily. Do you think I'll sit at home like a virtuous woman? The father of this baby's could be anyone. What's the guarantee he is yours? Curb your tongue- Don't you know only if I tell you? If you accept you aren't faithful- [baby crying] Then what does that make you? [baby crying] [spluttering] If you speak like this one more time, I swear I'll really kill you Virtuous wife indeed! [sobbing] 'I always feel I'm seeing you the very first time' How is that? Will you buy me a diamond necklace I like? Whats the big deal in it baby? [phone ringing] Hello. What? Move aside. 23 sleeping pills, sir The security guard came in to check as the baby was crying nonstop But her body had turned cold by then Press should not know this is suicide Hey! Look at my grandson. He looks like a foreigner He doesn't resemble you! Old hag- As if he will resemble my neighbour! 'The father of this baby could be anyone' 'What's the guarantee he is yours?' 'But for no reason whatsoever...' '...your post should not go beyond your blood relative or your lineage' 'What is the guarantee he is yours?' 'The father of this baby could be anyone' [door creaking] Hey! Our leader Namaste, sir What's this bad habit of falling at my feet? What's happening here? Are you all having fun when I'm not there? He's shooting his mouth off in the media You're all listening to it and- Bhai, what did I tell you? We repeated what you said verbatim to your son Varun When came here tensed as we heard of your punishment. -Meanwhile... Hey! I can't entrust you with things. -Where's my car? -Right here, sir Can you operate it even from here? [drone whizzing] Yes. It will keep following their car now. [drone whizzing] Mahendra Varun turns to him for advice at the drop of a hat! As soon as I get back I'll nail them down 1 week I entrusted you with my 20 years of experience ...you've brought me to the road Mahendra! I'll skin him aliv- Get me a cigarette, bhai Someone give a cigarette please No, sir No one has it, sir Otherwise ask him to stop at that shop and buy it. It's risky to stop on the way. Listen to me. Who will recognize me here? Ask him to stop [siren] Pull over at the kerb -Bro, bring a cigarette -Yes, sir [fans whirring] -Bhai -What, bro? What is it shining behind our car? Shining? [fans whirring] Security, come soon Coming sir [fans whirring] [blast] Allah! [explosion] [door banging] They are saying all kinds of things, bro They say there was a bomb blast when dad was on his way back home I believe no one knows about dad's condition I'm scared. Come fast bro. Okay, sir DGP is here We are waiting for his order Arrange for more Black Cats if necessary But- Sir. Very sorry to tell you. From Delhi prison en route to the airport ...your father has been attacked by a drone explosive 3 ministers and 6 security guards have been badly injured Your father Since your father was the target, the bomb exploded right next to him He's badly injured and is in a state of coma. Arrange a jet to leave for Delhi immediately Okay, sir Narmada Dad will be fine. Ask your mom to get ready We will be leaving for Delhi in half an hour. Our ex chief minister met with an accident... ...and is admitted here. -Our Cm is also here. 'Long live our leader' [indistinct people shouting] You don't know how strong your father is. But as the Opposition leader and a political rival all these years, I know him well I'm sure he will recover soon and be back on his toes -Be brave. Okay. -Thank you. We'll wait down till madam talks to him Hasn't your life been really topsy-turvy in this one month? I've come to see you only as a friend. We've been classmates from college Don't think of me as Opposition Feel free to call me whenever you need any help 'Speedy recovery to our leader' This is my visiting card Bye Varun. Kala... thank you. How is your dad now? Doctors say there's no point in us waiting here No one can predict when he will regain his consciousness They say there is no danger to his life as of now. I think we should shift him to a hospital in Hyderabad You're right, my boy. No use waiting here. My dad yells at everyone but never at me. I feel it doesn't matter if he gets up and yells at me now! Oh baby! Don't cry, dear Don't worry about your dad. He'll be fine soon. Be strong, okay? 'Tell us sir. How is he now?' How is our leader? Am I power crazy? Or am I experienced in this job? A problem arose and I spoke to the press to save our people's lives. But I get this feeling as if someone is trying to tie me down to this chair, sir I feel suffocated. Varun, I have a friend called Somasekar Quite a different character He works in a ship throughout the year But he never learnt to swim When I asked him why, he said... ...when the ship is about to sink mid-sea ...how does it matter if you know to swim or not One who doesn't know to swim will die One who knows will swim for a few days and then die without food or water Not only that, as soon as he knows the ship is sinking ...the one who knows swimming will try to jump to safety But the non-swimmer will fight to save the ship and it's passengers till the last. You are more or less in his shoes Even when you can't swim ...aren't you trying to save the ship and rescue the passengers? Okay, let me ask you in your own lingo Have you skipped straight to the last level of a video game and played it? How will it be? Very challenging Why? Gaming is a learning curve Only when we keep playing and reaching the next level ...we understand the game Exactly But wont the challenge hold your interest? At my age, do you know how I'm viewing your post? As a golden chance to bring about a massive change At your age, why don't you treat this as a video game? Get down to brass tacks! Long live our leader! But in this game ...the blood you see is real The enemies are real You taste this once ...you're addicted for life Life or death! Sir, Devaraju Intelligence Wing Investigating officer of this case Tell me You can discuss this in front of him. Go on. From the Intelligence reports, this attempt on your father's life is a local hand Plus your whole family is facing the same threat I've been issued orders to protect your entire family Especially your sister and you -For Narmada? -Yes, sir Even if it is cloaked in political tactics... ...involvement of 'hawala' and black money is suspected strongly We can't make this public But someone is trying to eliminate your entire family This is an unofficial question Do you know any details about your father's assets and will? I have no idea about any of his dealings Its time you made an effort, sir Another unofficial news is that Almost a 100 billion wealth is linked to this. What? -A 100 billion? -Yes, sir. For your own safety, it is imperative you find out about your father's assets It is possible only when you are in power If you get any information please let me know I'll take leave now. Thank you. Looks like I have no other option 'Long live chief minister!' I have to play this game 'Long live chief minister!' DGP sir, this is Varun here CM speaking The attempt on my father will incite an outburst of violence in that State Arrest the anti-social elements as a precautionary measure Our party representatives in particular Don't excuse councillors or any other politician If jails aren't enough, keep them under custody in wedding halls and schools Serve them biryani and release them after 2 days DGP sir, not even a street light should break in our State this time If any ruling party member showed off his credentials and created a ruckus... ...announce 'Rowdy CM' is on his way [music] [indistinct typing] [music] 'You said you'll be back in a week' Looks like a lot has happened meanwhile Doing well Wong. You? I, Varadharajulu Gangadhar alias Wong... ...am on top of the world You tell me What's up? I need your help I'll do anything for you. Shoot. I'm speaking from a secure line now. Let this be just between us Intelligence says there's a huge wealth linked to the murder attempt on my dad. In the false ceiling of my dad's room I found this diary It has 6 - 7 secret codes... ...and account numbers. What are these? Can you dig further into this for me? Bring it closer to the camera This is piece of cake, dude Don't worry I'll call you myself. [raining and thundering] -Have you got what I wanted? -Everything is ready. This file contains all the asset statements. I'm giving you the details as the primary party has approved you as the manager. You can just see them here but aren't allowed to take them with you. Handler Ramasamy? 20,700 crores! Wow! Robert. Do you the situation? My main party is in coma in the hospital. How do we do if I want money? I'm his brother-in-law You can draw upto 10 crores per annum without main party's permission. But any amount above that can't be taken or transferred to another name. You need the main party's signature for that. -What if that party dies all of a sudden? -Mr. Ramaswamy. The 5 minutes window is done. The 50 million you requested are in the car outside. Carry them carefully. [raining and thundering] Bhargav? -Sir -What's the reading? Situation is getting worse Forecast says another bout of heavy rains expected If we don't open the dam gates now it will be a fatal disaster -Didn't you consult the higher officials? -I'm trying my best VIPs who should decide are in the hospital 'The others don't want to take the blame' Or they pretend to be busy! 'Aren't the Ministers watching too?' What major work are they in when it's raining cats and dogs? Dad, why is it raining so heavily? There's nothing to cook at home Who anticipated this downpour, dear? Do you want me to go out and buy something? [phone ringing] Dad! -Is it Mahendra sir? -Yes? This is PWD chief engineer, Chandram here Don't know whom to approach now No time for the usual red tape -I was told CM will listen to you. -Tell me. All I need is just 1 order. We must open the sluice gate immediately It's a problem pertaining to a lot of lives sir. How can you say this in the last minute? Wait, I'll call you back [siren] I need a map of Ranga Reddy district Isn't there even a projector here? Sir, 3 ledgers have to be signed, I will be right there Connect the call [phone ringing] Mr Chandram, how serious is this? This is the situation half an hour ago All the lakes in the city are full We don't have and option but to open the sluice of Singur dam -Why not do that then? -Sir The dam is located 90km from the city So there is no threat to the city. But 40 km from the lake, there is Ranga Reddy district If we open the sluice, even if 60% floods the farmlands ...40% will flood the neigghboring villages. If we don't take adequate precautions ...it will endanger lives of people Why don't we open it in small measures? This should've been done 10 days ago step by step Now it's too late. But if dam gate isn't opened, the lake will breach Then why wasn't this done 10 days ago? Who is responsible for this? My dear boy, sluice is never opened without your father's permission Okay. Come sit down uncle. Please. Hey, all of you sit down Please sit. Make yourself comfortable. We'll deal with it when my dad comes out of coma Please come here sir. -You sir! Come here. -Me? Let's play a game Name of the game is 'Which comes first?' Will our leader come out of coma or the deluge will take a toll? What do you think? Sir you know... I don't know, sir You know no one here knows anything Why waste your sarcasm on them? Whatever you say will go above their heads! Listen, matter is very serious High possibility of heavy loss of lives Please understand that the people in this room won't be affected a bit. So you say opening the dam gates fully is our only option now Yes sir, but- What's the 'but', sir? Houses on the riverside will be badly affected Lives would be lost too. But aren't you saying we have no other choice! Damage is less if we open the sluice than breach in lake bund sir. 'Chandram sir, how long can you delay opening the dam?' Maximum 2 hours, but that's risky too. How long will it take for the water to reach the district border? Usually 4 hours But it might reach in 3 hours as the river being in spate. We have 4 hours Is it possible to evacuate the people in the affected areas? This task should have begun 2 or 3 days earlier We will need more man power too It is more difficult to evacuate people at night, sir 'We usually announce on loud speakers or the old fashioned beat of drums' I doubt if it will be heard in this incessant rain Then this can't be handled by our Govt resources alone 'Before the Army or Navy can help...' ...the entire area will be flooded and it will be a disaster, sir We have a huge army right here at our disposal Youngsters I'll make everyone pitch in Mahendra sir Prepare a list of 10 active youngsters from each area in Facebook and Twitter Get all the help possible from your friends and journalists Mr. Chandram, divide the water prone areas as stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 It's 6:40pm now. Open the sluice gate at sharp 8:40 Taking that as starting time ...I need a list of when and which stage you've divided is likely to flood Government staff Call all of them back Ask them to bring their toiletry kit Until this flood situation is amended... ...no one can go home Let's create a war room Ask our force to come to Vikarabad immediately Inform Control room of water level in Vidyanagar and Indira Nagar Call our MLAs in all the areas immediately - Attend to this at once - Check water level in Sultan Bazaar Inform the media Only then would the public know what's happening -I'll give you the press list. -Yes sir. This should go viral in Facebook and Twitter Bro, what is this war room our young leader was talking about? Maybe he'll book a room in a hotel? I don't understand either Not a war room, I think he was talking about a bar room! What? A bar room? That's true. We'll be up all night working. We'll be in high spirits with some booze! My dear public representatives A war room means... ...in case of such emergencies ...important people assembling at one place to take decisions in a jiffy That's what he meant So you've never done this before? In the present situation if the gates aren't opened, the dam will breach So we are about to open the gates now. It is likely to worsen the flood situation in some areas I'll list out 12 areas now which are the hotspots This News has to go viral at once Please share this information on Facebook and WhatsApp Call your friends and let them know Camps have been set up in all Primary schools in these areas If you're unable to reach these schools... we've got the high rise buildings opened in all these 12 areas You can go up there and take refuge until normalcy is restored Food packets will reach you through helicopter Govt is trying to do its best in this unavoidable scenario But... ...the Govt alone cannot do this singlehanded I need all the youngsters in the city to lend a hand 'For the next 24 hours...' ...all of you are Govt officials! Each and every one of you is my General! This list has name of the area and time of flooding 'Get the work going without panicking' Where are you going now? You keep saying I'm jobless Now our CM has called me for a Govt job! -See you, ma. -Hey listen! Start the bike, let's go But there's no problem in our area son! Old man, why hang in safe like babies? We will seek out the risk prone areas and help out Listen, we've got 25 blankets 100 sanitary napkins and some used clothes. Even we made a list to buy Medical kits, water bottles, biscuits, power banks, mosquito repellents We'll need around 25 to 30,000 easily 50 of us stay in our hostel Let's make Rs 500 per head as mandatory. Yeah. I think we can do it. We've assigned 3 leaders in each area as per your request 1 policeman, 1 fire service man and 1 social media activist We've assigned this hotline for them to call war room anytime -Good job. Proceed. -Okay sir. [water splashing] [helicopter whirring] [siren] -We have lost all our possessions. -Take this. Our houses have been swept away -Our children are starving -We are on it. Food will reach you soon. -This location has lot of problems. -Which area is that? -Moti Nagar sir. -Isn't Murali the MLA of Moti Nagar? Murali, I heard your area is facing a lot of problems People are unable to step out of their homes Call the Fishermen's union immediately. Ask them to bring boats or catamarans -Calling from Kothagadi, sir -Please tell me. We've received food and clothes for our area from Jadcherla But nothing has been distributed We don't know what to do Children are starving here, sir Please do something Hey! Sir is calling you -Aren't you in charge of Kothagadi? -Yes sir Why is the food not distributed as yet? Everything is ready long ago It's taking some time to stput on the stickers What? What sticker? How would people understand our service if we give them without our party sticker sir? 'That's the reason sir' In 15 minutes remove the stickers and try to send the truck Otherwise I'll stick a condolence poster for you! '-Okay, sir -Scroll down' -I'm stepping out, I'll be back -Mahendra sir War room is war room, even if it's you! No one is allowed to leave this place I've left Swathy alone in the house Varun. I'm unable to reach her over the phone -I'll just go and check in on her. -That isn't my problem sir. You can't go out now. What's the status of Vikarabad? -Sir, 1 minute. -Yeah. He's joking Just an hour ago he sent his own car to pick your daughter and brought her to his house. Since Singur dam gates was opened at midnight... ...in Ranga Reddy district Vikarabad, Kothagadi, Vidyanagar, Indiranagar, Moti nagar have been flooded Despite extreme havoc being wreaked Mr Varun's daring and timely initiative ...and with the tireless efforts of youngsters 24x7 ...huge loss of life was averted From the past 3 days, The CM, ministers, all Govt officials and party volunteers ...worked round the clock without going back home and having food [indistinct chattering] I've never seen such a diligent CM. You made those who hardly work during the day toil throughout the night son. Sir. Please sit down Mr. Chandra. Sir, the problem is solved just because you spoke to the CM. If anything had gone wrong, it would have haunted us lifelong. -Thank you very much. Oh no! Why are you thanking me? We should thank the CM and all the officials who worked 24x7 And the ones we'll deride as 'jobless jerks'... 1000s of youngsters Did you see how they worked? -We should thank them first. -Yes sir. At first I underestimated them considering their lack of experience. But they did a splendid job In this age of corruption Our youth had worked in dirt and drains without any expectation sir. I thought our CM Varun was irresponsible He astounded me We must trust our next generation, sir Who else can fix this nation which we have messed up all these years? That's correct sir. [siren] How come there's a power outage in the CM's residence? What a pleasant surprise Swathy! Hey bro! Don't act so innocent. Why do you look so tired dad? It's just that I didn't have any sleep for the last 48 hours So I feel drained out Try to catch up on some sleep dad. What? Sleep, huh? -Don't we have other plans, sir? -Yeah. -What plan? -Yeah what plan? [drinks] So you booze but you don't smoke, huh? Has your Government passed any new law that a habitual drinker must also be a smoker? At one point in his life he was a chain smoker Keep quiet, dear, don't remind me my past memories. Tell us, sir He ever tells me the whole story. I've asked him ever so often. Won't you tell me, sir? He'll tell you like a jigsaw puzzle My dad loved another woman before he married my mom As usual they broke up Devadas mode. He quit smoking for her only. What? Sir, is she good looking? Or is she very beautiful? Tell me, sir. The chief minister himself wants to know At least tell us now, dad Not an ordinary beauty She used to come to the Sports club to play badminton 'I used to frequent the tea stall opposite the club' 'And smoke away to glory in my usual carefree style' 'A car stopped in front of me. [vehicle purring] She got down and entered the club' 'I have never seen someone so beautifully sculpted!' She went in and I was waiting out for her to come out 'I lit another cigarette meanwhile' 'She finished her game and stepped out' Did you stub out your cigarette immediately, uncle? Oh no! That was when I was hard up for even 1 square meal a day I couldn't afford to waste half a cigarette I used to smoke till the very end till it touched the filter 'She got into the car and left and like an angel' 'I fell head over heels!' Did you fall for her beauty uncle? Like a gold fish I walked with a dropped jawline Municipality had dug a hole and I feel in that. [chuckles] Then I followed her everywhere. She used to give me a glance every now and then. A fleeting smile in the corner of her lips I was thrilled to bits catching a glimpse of that Suddenly one day she came down to me instead of getting into the car -And then? -Then what? Then she said 'If you keep smoking like a chimney always... ...your dream will never come true" Saying that she grabbed the cigarette from my lips and stubbed it out -Oh! -Aha? -Wow! -That's it. I quit the habit which I didn't despite the advice of many well wishers, for her. Then what was the next chapter in your love story? We spoke a lot and wandered all over the city. A man has a sense of pride when he is dating a girl he loves Then why didn't you tell your parents and get married to aunty? No one knows about this story Except my room mate Subramanyam He used to tell his stories and I was telling him my love story. One day all of a sudden her father got to know about us He threatened his daughter about caste and social status I went straight to meet her father 'He offered me a huge sum and asked me to ditch his daughter' 'Of course I refused' 'He threatened to hit me with his henchmen and I told him to go ahead' He realized his tactics weren't working with me Then he promised to get us married once she completed her studies I believed his promise and my life was ruined I got a call from her out of blue. She said her father had fixed a groom from their own caste to marry in three months. Her father had the money and the manpower Can we dominate them and get her fighting with people like a hero in the films? Even if I did, I must provide a good life style, right? I wasn't settled in life I thought about it and felt I should forget our love This life may be a better deal for her I told her she is better off marrying the groom her father chose I told her, 'let us forget everything' and hung up on her I snuffed half her life on that day 'On that day' means? Now is she- She is no more Did you meet her after that or did you talk to her? She called me just one day Before she passed away Did she tell you she was about to die? I found out only the next day when I was watching the news What did she tell you, on that day when she called you uncle? -Tell us, uncle -Narmada! He's very tired, dear. He has dozed off. Swathy, let's take him to his bed That Subramanyam My room mate Subramanyam He snitched to her father about us for his own selfish reasons and married her He grabbed everything from me My ruined my life. That Subramanyam. 'Hi dude, it looks thougher than I thought' Actually this is the most important account in your father's name This is a bank account in Hong Kong 'This account has cash transferred from the Shell companies in the Panama islands' But a commission amount has been transferred regularly to another account Commission, huh? Whom did dad transfer money to? His name is Robert, a Singapore national. 'Wait' 'I think if we nab him we will get some important info' -Thanks, dude I'll call you later. -Sure bro. DGP sir, I'm sending some details through your secure line It's a secret operation. -Namasthe. -Namasthe. We've come to see you regarding an important matter Please sit down Praise be to Allah! Tell me We don't know when our leader will regain consciousness Due to this verdict, mid-term election is due in the constituency where he lost God willing you should contest Why me? You can't occupy this seat for long if you aren't a MLA, my dear boy If you contest at this juncture you won't have any rival candidates 'You've gained ground with a good name now' You don't even have to campaign They would vote for you as soon as they see your name. He's right son. Varun contesting in the election is confirmed, dear. This is the right time we were waiting for. ...5 different countries. We are going to have a very important and powerful meeting. It involves a lot of international delegates and You need to see this sir. -Look at our Rowdy CM dude. -'Awesome man!' 'Video of Rowdy CM having a ball with a model has gone viral now' 'With the mid-term election coming up' -Where are you going now? -To meet Varun Dad! I was just beginning to think high of him Even I was feeling guilty for misjudging him earlier He showed his true colors now Why do you always support him? Why should you see him now? Let us not be quick to judge. I'll meet him and then call you. No need of that. Hereafter don't even take me to that house. Your video has gone viral now If you campaign now we will be inviting trouble Let's cancel our campaigning for the day Look how well we are being received in their constituency The public meeting today will be a grand success Advance congratulations to you! 'What would you do if your father is hospitalized and in a comatose state?' 'You would sit in grief' On the other hand our chief minister Rowdy CM is supposed to be unique he would be having a high time with 3 foreign females in a guest house. Chief minister should get down! Are you trusting someone like this? -No. No -Not at all! Tomorrow when people suffer from famine and hunger ...what if this same CM takes off to Bangkok to a massage center? Greetings to everyone. How are you? As usual let me come straight to the point I don't know who the prankster is But I thank them! The video is very clear! I won't say that it's not me or some computer graphics or mimicry That is me Chief minister should get down! Chief minister should come down! Don't be hasty But it has a small flaw Contrary to what you think, we didn't have fun in that resort A very well known person will explain what happened exactly' Namaste We made a short film on drug abuse as an awareness campaign Mr Varun had agreed to act in it. But became the CM half way through the shoot Not wanting to be the reason for hindering a good cause ...he finished this short film despite all the problems he's facing All the faces you saw are only actors Here are the working stills from the shooting spot Hi Friends! How are you? Varun is such a gentleman. I'm an actor from Germany. It was an honour to have acted with him. Long live Rowdy CM! [crowd cheering] After all this, if it is a crime for a hero to kiss a heroine... ...take a look at all this [Audio of Sannajajuloi song from the film Simha Baludu] They are actors turned politicians who ruled or want to rule you If you didn't vote for them, don't vote for me either But if you have voted for them in the past ...you have to vote in my favor too. [crowd cheering and whistles] Thanks. Namaskaram. 'Long live the CM!' Thank you sir. You did a last minute photo shoot bringing your crew over To top it all, for my sake you defended me to our people We are all aware this is a conspiracy by your enemies You are taking such good care of the people This is the least I could do, that's all I love Rowdy CM.All the best! This is Robert who works for an agency What kind of an agency? Politicians, industrialists and sportsmen who amassed a lot of black money in India All of them are customers of this agency 'The work of this agency is to invest the black money in India' 'in the shell companies in islands like Panama, Mauritius and Virgin Islands' Robert is the one who handled your father's accounts 'It isn't that easy to nab this chap' Without him, the details of the dummy owners of your father's Shell companies in Panama their net worth and other details cannot be known. -Good job. -Thank you sir. [phone ringing] -Your phone is ringing. -One second. -What's up? -Wong Pack your bags enough for a week -You are going on a trip -Where? Panama [electronic beep] I'm Kausalya, dear Open your eyes and look at me This is me, dear [percussions] Hello -Yeah Narmada? -Bro. Dad is moving his finger slightly Mom told me just now Narmada, that's good news But you haven't told this to anyone, right? Not yet, you are the 1st person I called Don't tell this to anyone. Okay? Okay. [phone rings] Yeah Varun. Sir, a new problem cropped up. What is it? My father is slowly regaining consciousness Good lord! The election is in the next couple of days If this news leaks out now ...sympathy factor will decline and people will be confused -What you should do is... -I already cautioned her. What did you tell her? I've told her not to publicize it Even you're becoming a seasoned politician If one is working on a ship, one has to learn to swim sir This should be kept under wraps for everyone's good sir. Can you go in person to the hospital, sir? Okay, I'll go -Hi uncle. -Hello sir. Hi darling, I heard your father has regained consciousness How is he doing now? He is asleep, uncle Doctor, an order has been passed not to publicize Mr Vasudev's health updates See, he has gained consciousness yesterday itself. How can I hide it? -Won't the visitors find out? -Don't let anyone in doctor. What reason do I give? Should we teach you all this? Give your usual reason Tell them there is a chance of an infection -Infection? -Yeah. Or come up with a name of any new disease -'Mashed up.' -What? Nasma Nasma Nephonia What do you say? What is this, sir? Where is the CCTV footage of his room being recorded? Crap. Hello sir. Is there old footage in this? -Data up to 2 weeks will be stored. -Very good. Then stop the 'Live' relay Go to last week's footage when the CM was in coma Can you play that footage on a loop? Sir, my career shouldn't be affected because of this This is a law & order political problem sir. Do what he says I'll ensure your protection. [music] -Hey Buddy. -Hey Wong, tell me. Just landed in Panama. I checked Robert's bank transactions just as you said There are 12 dummy directors in this country for your dad's assets I will be meeting all of them in person now Excellent Wong. Keep me posted. Wow! What are you saying? Narmada, you shouldn't yell in a hospital. Mom, Varun anna has won the election. They say his rival candidates lost even their deposits! It's a clean sweep! Now brother is an MLA too! 'I believe his rival candidates lost even their deposits!' 'It's a clean sweep!' 'I believe his rival candidates lost even their deposits!' 'It's a clean sweep!' 'Now brother is an MLA too!' [metal clanking] [gasping] Varun! It's been 2 days since your father called for you. Why don't you go see him? I'm in two minds, sir Meet him, let us find out what is in his mind Right from my childhood... ...I was always terrified of facing him TAnd he is asking to see me first! You are the chief minister of this State son! Are you scared of him too? Only if you go meet him, you'll know how much he remembers He has literally come from the jaws of death He could've changed for better. Why don't you go and look him up? I feel he will be cordial towards you now 'Gia go away!' PLEASE JUST GIVE ME SOME! SHOW ME THE MONEY AND THEN WE TALK. -No money no honey! -I have nothing on me. -Okay just let me take some and go. -Gia go away. I told you before do not come here with nothing. -I need the bucks. -You pig. HEY, YOU GIA? I'M WONG CHANG, FRIEND OF ROBERT FROM FOSSAK MONSEKA. FOSSAK MONSEKA DON"T SHAKE HANDS. OH WELL THEN LET'S GET INTO BUSINESS. MY FRIEND ROBERT HAD ASKED ME TO GIVE YOU 10 GRAND, SO ONE... AND HERE YOU GO GIVE ME THE MONEY. RELAX! LET'S DO THE ROUTINE FIRST. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? WHERE THE HELL IS ROBERT? OH THEN IT'S FINE! YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT. I'LL INFORM THEM. AND I'LL ASK ROBERT TO COME DOWN. YOU CAN TAKE THE MONEY FROM HIM. Wait. Come back. The usual thumb print, there you go. That's it. -Money. -Yeah. -Here. Good luck honey. -Thank you. Bye. [phone rings] Wong? Hey Chief minister!We have 10 billion now. Shell company's dummy director is a poor drug addict She has no clue she owns million dollars! She was just a stamp head to sign documents, that's all Good work Money to be deposited- I'll take care. Don't get tensed. I got to meet another 11 people. I'll keep you updated. Bye. Okay. [siren] Dad, bro is here Ma'am, everyone wait outside please. You also go, dear The election Narmada told me you won the election I heard you administer the State very well I feel so proud of you Are you stunned I feel this way? I had a lot of time to think here, right? I thought about everything The reason I dragged you into this political scenario is because I had no other choice. But now even I need some rest. The party too needs a new leader. I'll be at peace if you take up that responsibility. Haven't you hidden the fact that I have regained consciousness? That's fine. You did the right thing. I'll take some rest. Only wish is to share a few words with bhai. I would like to. Can I? Hey! Come here. Call bhai and give him. -Take care of your health. -Yeah. Tell me, Varun You were 100% right, sir I haven't seen my dad speak like this He has changed a lot. In the end when he asked my permission to share a few words with bhai... ...I felt so sad, sir. A person who reeked of temerity- You made a mistake Varun Sir? Before a politician, your father was a great actor Did you forgot that? Your litmus test starts now [phone rings] Namaste, this is Abu Thahir Bhai. I'm Vasudev speaking. Leader. Allah, I can't believe this! -Listen to me carefully. -Please tell me sir. I regained consciousness 3 days ago But he has kept it under wraps. I was inquiring about you daily But they chased me away blaming it on infection That's what they will say Assemble all the important party men and bring them over to meet me If you aren't allowed to meet me... ...threaten to break and damage hospital items Things have gone out of hand Why ruin your health? After you are back to normal- I am as good as new now Shut up and just follow my orders Hasn't it been ages since my leader yelled at me like this? [laughs] Swami-ji, I've got a couple of bad news '1st news is about Vasudev' He has regained consciousness in the hospital. You promised me he'll die. Thisnking that if he is no longer in power ...it will be easier to finish him off For the past 2 years... ...I had brainwashed him with astrology, horoscope etc. If your aim had been a bull's eye, we would have got an easy access to 20 billion by now! I swear we fixed the best assassin We didn't expect Vasudev will escape from such a powerful bomb blast What's the other piece of bad news? The man in this photo is Wong He's at the moment in Panama 'He's Varun's friend in London' 'He is a professional hacker it seems' 'He's the one who has hacked my email account' He's meeting all the dummy directors one after the other right now There is something wrong. Many accounts have been locked We underestimated that Varun 'If he has gone all the way up to Panama...' ...the problem is then beyond Vasudev's clasp [phone rings] Hey Varun! -Someone caught me man. -Who is it? He is chasing me like a dog. I don't know, looks like some bouncer in a pub man. He got 11 signatures from me -The money was- -Wong. -Aah! -Wong. Are you there? Swathi! [car brakes applied] Hey! Hi my name is Sylvia Me and Varun were actually in a romantic relationship. When he became Chief Minister, he left me. When I said I would g to the media... ...he started threatening me. If anything happens to me here in India... ...Varun and his men are responsible for that. -Please help me! -Good. Creating a sensation by releasing a video claiming CM Varun was in love with her... ...model Silvia was shot dead by unidentified assassins in a mysterious way. The chief minister is suspected of being guilty and foul play Hello? We were not able to track your friend Wong We lost the signal in the mobile number you gave us. You are No. 1 suspect in Silvia's murder. CBi has found out all the working stills you took with that film director to be fake Under the Governor's order Special force is on its way to arrest you It's advisable for you to go underground for 2 days, sir Can't you prove my dad was responsible for all this? Someone more powerful than Mr Vasudev is behind this If they are influencing the top government to arrest a chief minister... ...you are under the scrutiny of a very powerful bigwig And one more thing, sir I'm no more the DGP! I've been transferred to a Training college. [music] I'm thankful for the continuous prayers performed by my people. In these 2 months, because of me and my situation... ...people have gone through many hardships. When a case was foisted on me my party members discussed extensively... ...and made my son Varun the substitute chief minister Under the guidance of senior leaders... ...I expected him to govern the State in an efficient manner So did everyone else But what happened was contrary to my expectation. Only I have to take responsibility for that disappointment I have to apologize to you and rectify the mistake. Now, on behalf of our party... ...we will abdicate Varun of his post And will select a worthy representative from the party who will occupy the seat of power That diligent, honest volunteer belonging to our party Hey where are you Dasu? -Come forward. -Sir? Only he will occupy that seat of power Sir! You are my god. My savior who gave me life -You're the future CM! -Epitome of mercy! I'll give my life for you, my lord What crap! That Ramadasu? After all he's a henchman When Vasudev got hit on the head, did he lose his mind or what? For the past 20 years even you have somersaulted to grab the seat What is the use? Wonder what is ordained for whom! Who is this Ramadasu? He worked for Vasudev waiting hand and foot on him 'Ardent fan of Vasudev' -Varun. -Sir? Someone hit Swathy with a car and slipped away. She's hurt badly She is being taken to the emergency ward The police protection you had arranged is missing I'm scared and suspicious of everyone -Don't know what to do.-Sir, please stop crying Swathy will be fine I'm here in- Varun, do something fast Her condition is serious She'll be fine sir. Sir, give me 1 hour I'll take Swathy and you to a safe place As quick as you can What are you looking at? What are you staring at me for? Want to arrest me? Here, do it Oh, is that a different group? Then get out Get out! [music] Register in the party office and then let me know [phone rings] Kala, I'm Varun speaking Hey Varun I set up Sylvia and arranged for that video to be shot But I'm no way connected to her murder I knew long ago you won't go to that extent I need your help In a way, I'm to blame too if you are in this mess Tell me how I can help 1 mobile phone, few laptops and 1 ambulance Importantly, a place to stay incognito First 3 won't be a problem But a place no one can trace you to... Kala If you set your heart you can do it Couldn't get him to sign a mere resignation letter! So what if he isn't in the Secretariat? Couldn't you have met him at home? Varun is missing. No one knows his whereabouts The cops are looking for him too How will we know where he is hiding? Giving me lame excuses! We need to immediately pass a No confidence motion in the Assembly Consider it done Have our MLAS ever disobeyed your wishes? -We'll do it for sure -Fat hopes! I'm a witness to your goof-ups Listen to me clearly Not 1 vote in the total 160 votes should be cast in his favor Aren't there 30 minsters with us? Didn't you line your pockets well? Each minister should take responsibility for his constituency If even 1 vote is cast against us...! 2 days 48 hours Suppress all your urges Not one of you should stumble Okay, sir That means what the hell will you do, huh? There wouldn't be a problem sir. Everyone is in our control. Control it seems! -Ramasamy -Yes, sir. Get the boxes ready to dole out to the politicians Okay, leader Why hang around? Attend to your work We'll take leave, sir Bro, you appointed Varun in this seat much against the wishes of everyone I understand you don't like his attitude and befriending Mahendra, but- But what? What's the issue now? How can you appoint Dasu as chief minister, sir? People are opposing this move It is well known he is your stooge If you can appoint a well qualified person- Are you imparting your pearls of wisdom to me? Won't I know the likes and dislikes of the people in all these decades of experience What is this sudden show of concern, bhai? Has Bhai become power crazy too? What's wrong if I wish to be CM? I've travelled this journey with you from day 1 I've shared good and bad times with you You don't even trust me though Dasu joined after I did? No I don't! I lost it. So what now, huh? Bhai, do you think I'm blissfully unaware of your antics with Varun and Mahendra? Bhai, only because of the same sense of gratitude you specified that you are here. I'm feeling sleepy. Aah! Where are the documents? Let me go man. My friend is a Chief Minister. I'll get you some land in Financial Estate! Please let me go Oh no! Don't worry You'll be on your feet soon No problem, dad I am fine Attend to your work without hassle. -Take care Swathi. -Hmm. Wondering why I asked you to come to a random house all of a sudden? This is our emergency war room How can you be so sure the cops won't trace you here? They won't come looking for me in this place for sure I swear it's going above my head Because this is the residence of the Opposition leader No one can ever understand you. [music] [loud cheer] [splash] ROBERT. YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO SWAMI JI. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE DOCUMENTS ARE. HE'S NOT OPENING HIS MOUTH. I'VE BEEN TRYING. YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO SAMI JI. MAYBE THIS GUY HAS GOT NOTHING. EXACTLY. YOU NEED TO CALL ME BACK ASND LET ME KNOW. [electrical buzz] Aah! I am totally baffled All our accounts are frozen I'm unable to withdraw the cash [phone rings] Ramasamy has been bugging me for his payment Talk to him Robert, it's a matter of utmost urgency When will I get my 4 billion? Mr Ramasamy, listen to me without getting tensed There's some confusion in Vasudev's offshore assets -What are you saying? -I'm trying to solve it. But it's very dicey to take the money out Why are you bungling everything? Assembly starts tomorrow How can you say this now? Robert, this is a matter of life or death Ramasamy... Tell him we'll arrange a loan Let the problem be solved now We can weigh the pros and cons later We need the support of every legislator now Mr Ramasamy Sir, we were tracking Robert's phone as per your suggestion Just listen to this Mr. Ramaswamy, you and your ministers are our important clients We'll get you 4 billion as loan from an outside source We can discuss this once the problem is solved Do that man. When will that truck with the consignment be ready? It is coming from Tamil Nadu within the next 2 hours I'll text you the vehicle number. Kindly clear the route They shouldn't lay their hands on this cash Let us inform the cops to halt the vehicle We don't know whose side the cops will swing to? They have removed even you from your seat Media is the right solution for all this If you had let us handle this situation ...we would have aced it! To grease the palms of the MLAs of the ruling party ...booty worth 4 billion was being transported in a container ...according to a WhatsApp News with photo and registration details ...the container was blocked by the Press The police force that reached the spot diverted the truck ...to the collector's office in Suryapet Hearing about this, ruling party's volunteers ...and civilians have zeroed in to the spot The venue looks like a war field How did they zero in on our truck? Even we don't know to identify the vehicle But I don't know how they knew exactly Their identification was 100% right It has been confiscated at the collectorate in Suryapet Dasu, call that collector -Hello? -It's Vasudev speaking. Tell me sir. This cont...container is mine It is a matter of utmost urgency Just clear it as soon as you can This whole place is encircled by Press and the Opposition party men ...insisting the truck should be opened So the cops are scared to talk to us Please wait till the media is cleared, sir My hands are tied I'll try my level best, please understand sir -Take it. -Sir. -Hey Ramasamy -Sir? Arrange a different source 20 million each for 160 MLAs Total 3.2 billions, it's just peanuts. Leader? It seems there is some confusion in our Shell account I've taken even this 4 billion only as a loan In my account is there a confus- How can there be a confusion in my accounts? I would've stored it in gunny bags in my go-down the normal way You were the one who said kossack pissack Panama and all that crap Hey Ramasamy, if I don't get back my money I'll pound you to a paste Assembly is being convened tomorrow And you've left me in the lurch- -Hey! -Sir? -Get the vehicle. -Yes, sir I'm going straight to that beach resort from here If I talk to them face to face my MLAs will agree I will spend the night over there Even during the bomb blast tumbling face down I was with him He's making a random rowdy chap as chief minister. Is there no respect for honest hard work? [phone vibrating] Hello? Who is this? Uncle, I'm Varun speaking Varun? I went to your place looking for you. Where are you? That isn't important, uncle I called you to speak about something else Tell me. I believe you and my dad had a difference of opinion. Just 5 minutes ago, your father and me were talking in the hospital in private. How did you get to know so fast? When I could cut his room's CCTV footage ...is it so tough for me to track the hospital's CCTV footage? I have a recording of what you both spoke -Shall I send it through WhatsApp? -No need. Varun, listen to me once. Party, money, rule, it's is all in your father's favor Forget all that Whose side are you on? Okay, you don't have to tell me right away Let me update you for 5 minutes on certain important issues You let me know your decision after that My dad's money is in my hands lock, stock and barrel now Not just that When I transferred it because of dummy directors ...their entire booty also is now in my possession If they comply to my needs I'll part with at least 50% to them Otherwise what they amassed all along will go down the drain It's your responsibility to convey this to them at the resort If you don't carry out this request... '...Dasu will be the next CM of this State' [unlocking] Hello, bhai, come inside. -Come in, bhai. -Join us for dinner. I want to talk to all of you That's why I'm telling you My kith and kin who moulded me I am in a dicey spot in my political career My own son is now seeking vengeance on me like a snake about to strike I am not scared Why should I be anxious when you're with me? You are the apple of my eye You're like king Karna's armour. Why should I be scared? Tomorrow when you cast your vote all your votes should be for me. Oh god! The leader himself is in tears. How sad! Consider it done, sir We are willing to forsake our lives for you [voices in unison] I'm glad. Tomorrow we join hands to rewrite history -Dasu? -Leader Come here Dasu is my faithful shadow You know how much he has served our party You should cast your vote for him without splitting the votes -Yes, leader -Okay, sir - Yes, sir - He is our candidate Okay, go to your rooms and relax Long live our leader! Long live! Long live! -Bhai. -Leader. Yesterday I was so tense and I spok- How can I forget our bond- It's okay, bro, don't feel bad. Go and rest up. Everything will fall in place -Okay. -Das. Are you implying my dad is not linked with any of these events? Your dad is a mere politician That god-man is the sole reason for everything He used an assassin called Salim and tried to kill your dad to usurp his wealth I somehow transferred the accounts of all the 12 dummy directors ...to my account finally Interest alone is 1 billion! What will I do with so much money? For the time being go back to London I'll tell you what to do with the money Looks like you have lots of news to publish when you're back on your feet. I've put you to so much trouble because of my problem Sorry. I'll come back later No. Come. -How are you? -Better. Is it still paining? So...are you ready for the big day? What is it? Kala, I don't know why you took so much risk and did all this for me I didn't go out of my way selflessly, Varun My dad has been struggling to defeat your dad all these years But your dad was unshakeable This is a chance for us through you And I thought I should study you at close quarters to win against you I'll be your political opponent in the coming years, right? Don't thank me too much We will always be political opponents [indistictive voices] We are eagerly waiting in front of Assembly... Will Mr Varun win or not in the 'No Confidence' motion? [indistictive voices] We will know anytime now Is it all in order? Madam, I've checked it 4 times This is the result [bell rings] Silence please! 38 votes have been cast against Mr Varun 122 votes have been cast in support of him Mr Varun proves a clear majority in this Assembly He will continue as the Chief minister [grunting] [music] [siren] Long live Chief minister Varun [crowd cheering] [whistles] [loud cheer] Mahendra Varun, come Move! Move aside Subramanyam, what happened? Mahendra. Call the ambulance immediately Harboring all the past in your heart ...you took revenge, right? That antagonism will never fade But I have never thought of seeking revenge 'Subramanyam' 'My room mate Subramanyam' 'He was trying his luck to get into movies' Why trouble yourself? Looks like Chithra would have thought of only you in her death bed 'I have never seen such a beauty!' 'Suddenly one day she came to me instead of getting into the car.' 'She grabbed the cigarette from my lips and stubbed it out' 'Only my room mate Subramanyam knew about our love story' 'He used to share his experiences with me Even I told my love story only to him' 'He snitched to her father about us for his own selfish reasons' 'And married her' 'As if you married me without any political agenda?' 'You'll have a fling A different female daily' 'Did you think I'll sit at home like a virtuous woman?' 'The father of this baby's could be anyone' 'What is the guarantee he is yours?' What the hell you speak? [choking] Poor Chithra! She was faithful to you You were the one who didn't trust her Let me tell you now After she got married to you... ...she didn't meet me even once She called me just once the day before she passed away 'What did she tell you, uncle on that last day when she called you?' Mahendra, I'm Chithra speaking After how many years, Chithra How are you? I'm not feeling good, Mahendra I've been very faithful to my husband Vasudev But he has flung me aside and is running behind other females I don't wish to live, Mahendra It will all change for the good My life won't change in this birth If something happens to me My son Varun Poor boy If he needs anything ...you should take care of him -Please. -Certainly But nothing will happen to you Don't fill your head with such thoughts Chithra [baby crying] Sorry Varun You are unaware of any of this But I helped you willingly from the bottom of my heart I am very fond of you Hey! Varun Though I am his father I regarded him as my enemy and wanted to defeat him But you stood by him And made him the chief minister I'm very happy son. How many times I've suspected you aren't my son? Rule this State better than I did Must serve the people well Reporters are waiting for you Go Talk to them 'Long live CM Varun!' Thank you for accepting a newbie like me To all my Telugu brothers and sisters Thank you [phone rings] We followed up on your request and investigated that god-man case In 1 particular case People from a village near his 'ashram' have filed a case against him 6 years ago, the lake in this village dried up Some farmers committed suicide along with their families You must have heard about it How is the god-man linked with that incident? Blocking the water source from the mountain to this lake... ...he has built his hermitage on a 400 acre land 8 farmers hung themselves to death from a tree, due to water scarcity But the case was closed because that god-man was close to your father. The villagers didn't have the money to proceed with the case sir. India's most acclaimed lawyers' team will defend these villagers in court I'll bear the entire expense DGP sir This is just the beginning Step by step we will ensure a full stop to that god-man's activities [sirens] I've often wondered Why are these Govt buildings so excessively magnificent in structure? Why such imposing pillars and regal steps? Why should a motorcade follow the chief minister unnecessarily? Only now I realize This show of pomp and splendor is a symbol of power People from outside should look at this as a temple And the man inside should appear as God A wave of fear should envelop I am in that position today I cannot play God At least I will try to be a decent human being! Sir. You must have wondered why I called you here We won't be campaigning in our next election We won't go door-to-door and lobby for votes No palms will be greased No freebies in cash or kind We will create a change which will be visible to all [electronic buzz] This is the river Moosi in 1960 Boats were plying to and fro daily All of you are aware of its state today We should restore this river within the next 3 years I want to clean this river to its original state And I'll launch a boat trip 1 day before the election Don't wonder how this is possible We have money at our disposal We have the best intellectuals in our country Our youngsters back me up I have immense faith in this war room Shall we start?
