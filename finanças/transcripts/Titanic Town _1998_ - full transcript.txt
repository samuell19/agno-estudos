[dynamic music] [children shouting] [lock rattles] [children shouting] [dog barking] - Keeps going round. [apple crunches] - If you want, my Niall will break in for ya. - No, thank you. - [Annie] When I was 16, my mother became a celebrity. - All right, look, don't watch us. You're making me nervous. [girls chuckle] - [Annie] We thought that we'd left The Troubles behind us. - Have you come far? - Down the Falls. And yourself? - Bombay Street. Burnt out in '69. [lock clicks] - We're in. - Great. - [Annie Voiceover] What we didn't know was that they were just beginning. [children shouting] - You got it, got it? - Yeah, I got it. - What are they for? - Reading. - You're lucky you have the time. - No, they belong to my daughter. - She must be awful clever. - She is. Thank you. [Aidan shouts] - Mommy says you're too old for dolls. - [Bernie] I didn't switch it on! I switched it off! - They're not dolls. They're role models. - That were familiar once round my dead hearth. Lord, thou art hard on mothers. We suffer in their coming and in their going. Though I crutch them not, I weary. Weary of the long sorrow. And yet, I have my joy. My sons were faithful and they fought. - [Aidan] Well done, Nora. Well done. - No one's said it like that in a long time, girl. - It'll take the tear out of a glass eye. - Oh, I love her. She was thinking about her son. - Is he dead? - Daresay, no, he's in Long Cash. - Where's Long Cash? - He's in jail. - What about a song? - Oh, that's a good idea. - Where's Colm? Colm will give us a song. Colm! - Colm! - Colm, son. Where is he? - He's in there. He's hittin' the beer. [family shouts happily] - What'll it be? - Danny boy. - Come on, Danny Boy. - Our Kathleen sent for Danny Boy. - [Tony] Sing a rattle song, Colm. - A Roddy McCorley. - Kevin Barry. - What about a song where nobody gets killed? - [Colm] A Jug of Punch? - [Man] No, it were not. - 'Cause if the bits don't get you, the drink will. [family laughs] - I hate that song, but it's better than the rifles of the IRA. Well, James's wife is English. I don't want to give offense. - I'm not English, Bernie. I'm from Newcastle. - [Bernie] Oh, right. - That's you two. - It is. [Bernie laughs] - How come Uncle James has had three wives, and you've only had one? [people laugh] - Ah, well, he lives in London. - [Tony] Go on, Colm. ♪ Oh Danny boy ♪ The pipes, the pipes are calling ♪ ♪ From glen to glen and down the mountainside ♪ ♪ The summer's gone and all the flowers are dying ♪ ♪ Tis you, tis you must go and I must bide ♪ ♪ But come ye back when summer's in the meadow ♪ ♪ Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow ♪ ♪ And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow ♪ ♪ Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy ♪ I love you so ♪ Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so ♪ [soft radio chatter] [distant applauding] [helicopter propellers whipping] [helicopter humming] [clock ticking rapidly] - [Bernie] Annie, are you outta bed?

Oh, where the hell are my clothes? - Annie, close your eyes, your father has no trousers on! - Maybe we should let him in. - Jesus, no, you'll all be lifted! - It'll be better than being dead! - [Bernie] I don't care! I'm not having sheets in this house! - Bernie don't open the door! [gunshots blasting] - All right, hey, hey you!

[helicopter propellers whipping] [gentle guitar music] [birds cawing] [birds chirping] - [Annie] Where we going? This isn't a shortcut, Bridget. - It is if you know the way. - A bus would be quicker. - I can't afford 10 embassy on the bus. Now, come on. - You said. - It's this way. [women laughing] - Mommy, Annie's here. She's with Bridget and Maureen. - Well, no wonder she's late. All right, hurry now. Come back with a medal. - [Mary] Are you not going with her? - She says I put her off. [laughs] - Look, she's a wee beauty. - No, don't be telling her that, Mary. [hand knocking] - Do you think the Protestant girls have more sex than Catholics? - I think whenever it comes to sex, all mothers are Catholics. [girls laugh] - Bridget, you got a light there? - You're gonna go back to jail. - Is he? - We're gonna be late! - Shut up, Sinead. - See you later. - Okay. - Do you know him? - Jimmy Kean. He's a mate of our Maryann's fiance. - He's a hateful pig. - Oh, you fancy him. - I do not! He's out there giving me a dirty look. - [Maureen] I don't think he was giving you a dirty look. - [Annie] No? - [Maureen] It was more of a sexy look actually. - [Bridget] And what would you know? - Well, more than you. - Put that down, Lisheen. - You only smoke because you think it makes you look sexy. - Oh! - But what you don't know is is that you smell like a dirty, big ash tray. - Oh, fuck off! [upbeat fiddle music] - What age would you say he was? - Oh, about 22 maybe. - Jesus, the dirty beast. She's still only a wee child. [students applauding] [girls chattering] [explosions blasting] Get down! [girls groan] [dog barks] [soldier groans] - Holy God. - Are you all right, son? - Could you get him, Aidan? Is he dead? - No, he's been shot on his side! - I'll call for an ambulance! - Bernie, get a blanket or a towel or something! [soldier groans] Here, just relax. I'm gonna make you comfortable. - Here, Aidan, stick this under his head. You're bloody lucky the IRA doesn't come back and finish you off, so you are. - What's your name, son? - Lionel Thurston. - Right, now I'm gonna have a look at the wound, Lionel, right? See if I can stop the blood. Oh, yuck. - [Patsy] Jesus, he's a goner. - Am I gonna die here? - No, no, no, no. It's not as bad as it looks, son. - The ambulance is on its way. I'm sorry I couldn't find a better towel for you, son. All my good towels are in the laundry. - There, that'll stop the bleeding. - Here, Mama. - All right. Here! [ambulance siren honking] - I only arrived here last week. - There, you've had a warm welcome. They're bound to send you home soon. - I hope so. I'm never coming back here. - [Patsy] If you hadn't have come here in the first place, you wouldn't be lying here in ours in your own blood. - Go get something for the neck. - All right. - All right, son. - All right. - Gonna stretch your leg. [soldier groans] - Bring the guns. - Right, get a good grip. One, two, three, lift! [soldier groans] Here we go. You're all right. - Lift! - [Aidan] You're not gonna bandage him first? Are you crazy, Mister? Just a patch covering? [engine revs] [ambulance siren honking] [Aidan groans] - What's wrong, Aidan? - It's just me ulcer flaming up. - God, it's all the water. You just need a bit of peace and quiet, come on. - [Aidan] Oh, this peace and quiet, I wonder, when am I due?

You don't want to be caught in your pajamas in the middle of a raid. Aidan McPhelimy, would you put your trousers on! - What? - They're ready to come and get you and you're bare-arsed! - [Aidan] Going. - Sinead, will you get out of that bed. Come along, now! [dogs barking] - [Man] You're hurting me arm. You're gonna break me arm. - [Sinead] Why are the soldier's taking Bradley's daddy? - Are they arresting him? - What do you think? - But he's a quiet, wee man. He wouldn't be in on anything. - They pick up the quiet ones to see if they can get them to talk about everybody else. It's an old technique. Bernie, where are you going? - [Bernie] His daughter's handicapped. And Doris needs his wages. I'm gonna tell that soldier! - I want to come, Mommy! - Down there, you two come with me. - Excuse me! Excuse me. Where are you taking him? He has a handicapped daughter. - None of your bloody business, now get back inside. Go on, hop it. [radio chattering] - I could have told you. - I had to try. - Do your worst! The British Army's always been great at attacking the defenseless and the downtrodden! We've been fighting yous for 800 years! We fought yous at Clontarf! - Shuey. Go shut her up. - And at Mullingar! At the Battle of Kinsale! - When she gets to The Famine, call me. Very good on The Famine. [woman mutters angrily] - Lay 'em in the vehicle. - In you go. - These fellows are lifting our geriatrics. - He must have been on the list. - But old Gerard O'Hannan hasn't been active since the sinking of the Titanic. [woman shouting] - Who's in charge here, I know my rights! - We'll beat yous in the townlands! And in the streets of Derry! We'll beats yous in the vales and in the craggan. We shall not fail! - Excuse me, Ma'am. - Yes, what is it? - [Soldier] I've got to take a look inside your house. - And what right have you to search my house? This is Ireland. A sovereign nation, not a colony. - [Soldier] With due respect, Ma'am. Ulster is a part of the United Kingdom. - Ulster my arse! I do not recognize the British jurisdiction in Ireland. - Nevertheless, we're gonna search your house, with or without your cooperation. - I'm not stopping yous! I have nothing to hide! Wreck the place! Tear up my floorboards, tear out-- - Jesus, we'll be next. Way up, Annie, quick, and make the beds. - Why is it always me? - Go on now! - Where's her man these days? - Well, he's gone on the run. - He wouldn't be in on anything. The IRA wouldn't have him, he's a drunk. - Oh, he's gone on the run from her. - They think they have pacified Ireland. They think they've purchased the half of us, and intimidated the other half! They think they've foreseen everything! But defense, defense. They've left us our Fenian dead. And while Ireland holds those graves, Ireland unfree shall never be at peace! - Holy God, she got that all right. - I don't care if she did or not. She's letting the whole street down in front of them. - Who cares, it's only the British Army. - I care, there's such a thing as dignified resistance. - Search inside. - Sure, why not? - [Officer] Go on, lads. - [Soldier] In. In. - All right. - [Soldier] In. - Excuse me, please. - Will you look at the dust under your bed? - All right, lads. [motor humming] [radio dispatcher chattering] - Right, here we go, lads. Which one are you with? Aidan McPhelimy. - That's me. - What do you want him for? - Come get over here, please. - [Officer] Up against this wall, clear a space. [Annie mutters] - What are they gonna do to you, Aidan? - I think they're gonna take my photo actually, Patsy. - [Soldier] Don't smile, mate. - Hey, you're in your own country. - What are you gonna do with that? - It's just for our files. - You mean he's a suspect? - [Officer] It's just routine, all right? - [Sinead] Daddy. - Gun, she's got a gun! - Excuse me. - [Annie] Sinead! [guns cocking] - [Aidan] Put the gun down, Sinead! - You forgot your rifle. - Oops. Better not forget that. [explosion blasting] [people screaming] [motor humming] [soldiers shouting] [motor humming] [footsteps thudding] - [Girl] Why is she laughing, Mommy? - [Woman] She's not laughing, she's crying, love. - Bastards, bastards! [girl shouts] - Eileen Curran's shot in the face with a rubber bullet! She was up near her window. - Oh, mother of God. [radio dispatcher chattering] - I saw the one who did it. A skittery big git with sandy hair and a wee mustache! Oh, he's not here now. The bugger disappeared right after. - He got away for fear the people would lynch him! - Well, I seen the one who did it, and I'm not afraid to say it! - Inside, please, on the double. - Why, so you can shoot more of us like you shot that poor woman? - Look, get inside! Or you'll get the same bloody thing! Now back to your houses! - I can't believe he said that. - Walk slowly, girl, don't run. [solemn guitar music] [radio dispatcher chattering] [door creaks] - He says his stomach was hurting him. - [Bernie] Has anyone called an ambulance? [van door bangs] [man shouts] [ambulance siren honking] - [Radio Announcer] And the Portrush player-- - First she wanted it all black, but he didn't like it. Then she wanted a silver streak, but he thought red would be better. When she came back a fourth time, I refused. Says I, "Woman, dear, "leave your hair alone and change your husband." [women laugh] - Mary, can I leave Brendan with you till I get back from the hospital? - Surely, he can come to the butcher's with me. Sit down and get your breath back. - I still have my messages to do. - [Mary] Bernie, if you don't take it easy, you're gonna end up in the same place as Aidan. - He'll not hold down that job now, and, what, with me out of work as well? - Something will turn up. - See you later! - Bye, Mom. - Bye, Bernie. - Sit down, Brendan. Go on, love, I won't be long. - [Radio Announcer] The weather out and about in the province is warm and sunny and is set to continue. - Oh, and I'll have six lamb loin chops for now. And keep a leg over for Saturday. - I've no loin on his shoulder. - That'll do rightly. [cleaver thuds] [children shouting] [footsteps thudding] [explosion blasts] [children scream] [men shout] - [Soldier] Get your ass over here now! [men shout] [footsteps thudding] - Holy mother of God. - Is she cold, Mommy? - No, son, she's dead. - Do you know who she is? - Yes, she was my bridesmaid. [footsteps thudding] [radio chatter] - [Soldier] This is 1-1 Bravo. Contact, wait out. [somber guitar music] - I think she's dead, over. [soldier chattering on radio] - If you ever get shot, will you leave me those dolls in your will? - No, I want them buried with me. [rain slapping] - What's he doing? - [Annie] He's getting very left. - He's crushing the French marigolds. - He's wasting his time. The boys don't come out when it's raining. [somber guitar music] - Excuse me, do you know Jim McFarland? [horn honks] [tires screech] [windows shatter] [boys shout] [boys shouting] [glass shattering] - [Man] Come on in here! - [Man] Get out of the road, you big cunt! [bus crashing] - [Man] Look, we've just lost another bus. - Sorry. - Huh? Top of the Falls, where else? - It's only a scratch, it isn't necessary. - There might be glass in it. - I'm the doctor here, I should know. - You're a doctor? - Yeah. - If there's anything I hate, it's a doctor. - Well, I haven't qualified yet, I still have exams. - My daddy's had an ulcer for years, and the doctors told him it was the drink that was doing it. He's been a teetotaler all his life. All them doctors want is to put you under the knife. - I also sell ice cream. - Ice cream? - Yeah. - That's much better. - Your good health. - Aye, no more doctors. - No more doctors. [glasses clink] [Annie chuckles] - Ooh. - Can we get another one? - It was that stupid Bollocks McCormack shot Mary McCoy. - I was told it was the Army did it, not the IRA. - They had to say that. - So what are they gonna do with him? - Well, there'd be an inquiry, you know. he'll have to be disciplined. - Disciplined? I'm sorry, but am I on my own here in finding this offensive? - Calm down, Bernie. - Don't tell me to calm down. Some insignificant wee fucker shot Mary McCoy in front of my son. And what makes it worse, I was relieved it was her and not my Brendan. [crying] [ambulance siren honking] [rock thudding] [boys shouting] - How you feeling? - I'd be okay if the corner of that cable would just stay down. [giggles] There it goes again, did you see that? - I can't see anything without my glasses, to be honest. Jesus Christ. [explosion blasting] You should have told me you'd never had brandy before. - [giggles] Brandy, never had a drink in my life. - Why didn't they just own up instead of blaming the Brits? - Because the Brits don't own up. - You'll lose the support of the people, Tony. And another thing. Where were they when Mrs. Curran was shot? - They're fighting a guerilla war. You don't hardly expect them-- - Stop the car, stop the car! - What, why? What? - I just seen our Annie with a boy. - For Christ's sake, Bernie! I thought the bloody SAS were behind us. - Just wait here a minute and then I'll walk you home. - Is this where you live? - No, I'm dropping off my laundry! - Doesn't look like a laundry. - That's what my sister says. [door creaks] Anybody in? [wind chimes ringing] - You can't guarantee it won't happen again. As long as you have shooting in broad daylight and children coming home from school and women shopping. - I hid in the bushes. - Go and help Thomas unpack the groceries. There's a good girl. Have you any Valium, Rosaleen? All we need is to get the shooting re-timetabled. - I agree with you. - Well, can you not talk to somebody? - He already has. - Oh, thanks. - Look, Bernie, there's a meeting tomorrow. It's just for the women of the estate. Why don't you go along to that? - Me? Rosaleen knows more about this than I do. - Aye, but if Rosaleen says anything, it'll look as if I'm getting involved. - I'll go with you. - Is cousin Tony one of the boys? - Nah, he's just their political advisor. She knows. [door bangs] - Jesus. - All I want is a peaceful life for my children. I am gonna kill you, wee girl. Have you completely lost your mind? Mary McCoy is lying dead tonight and Eileen Curran has lost half her face. And what is our bold Annie doing? Running around chasing boys! - I have no idea what you're talking about, Mother. Don't cheek me, I saw your testament with my own eyes. - Easy on, Bernie. - I left you here to look after this house and this family. - They're not my children, they're yours. [footsteps thudding] - So what you gonna do? - I'm going to the meeting. [women chattering softly] [door creaking] - Are you from the, are you from the estate? - [Woman] Do you think the government's entitled to-- [journalists chattering] - Are you the Women for Peace group? - [Woman] What do you expect is being-- - Are you the Women for Peace group? - No. - So you don't support peace. - Yes, yes, we support pace. But has anybody noticed the level of army activity on this estate recently? - Thanks, love. [journalists chattering] - Thank you. - Thank you. - [Woman] Keep it rolling. - [Journalist] Excuse me, ladies. Excuse me, ladies. Would you like to like to have a few words? - They're not from Andy Town. - They're not from the same planet. - [Rosaleen] They look like unionists to me. - They look like they're gonna do all the talking. - Here, Bernie. Get on, you up there. - No, I couldn't, no. No, I'm sorry. [women applauding] [women chattering] - Thank you. Thank you. And on behalf of the South Belfast Women's Institute, Women for Peace Group, bit of a mouthful that, I would like to thank you very much for inviting us here today. My name is Alison Lockhart. - What did I tell you? Protestants. - Before I open this meeting, I would like to remind you that it is only the women that can stand together and show the way. It is only by reaching a deeper, fuller understanding of each other's needs that we can hope to come together as one peaceful community. - Go on, Bernie. - Erm. Excuse me. - Yes? - Well, the point of this meeting, I live on this estate, is that we can't have shooting during the daytime. - [Woman] Here, here. - [Alison] Would you like to come up to the platform please and state your name? - Go on, Bernie. Go on. [women applauding] - I warn ya, don't mention the IRA. [women applauding] - I'm Bernie McPhelimy. - [Woman] Speak up! - Oh sorry. - We can't hear you. - Right, I'm Bernie McPhelimy. I think that we have to be very practical. [microphone whirs shrilly] Sorry. We have to be very practical. And I, for a start, I think the people outside should be allowed in. - Mrs. McPhelimy, we do have an agenda here, and I do intend to take one issue at a time. - Well, there is only one issue. And that's to get the shooting stopped. [women applauding] - Here here, here here. - I think we need to take a look at the broader picture first. Surely, our first priority is to find common links between our two communities. - [Deirdre] I, erm. I would just like to support what Bernie McPhelimy has said. - Could you identify yourself, please? - My name is Deirdre Gorman. You see, we have a local problem here, which may not be the same as your problem. [women shouting] [fists banging] [women chanting] - [Women] Give us back our sons! Give us back our sons! Give us back our sons! Give us back our sons! [women shouting] Shh, shh, shh! - Ya fuckin' backsliding traitors! One bit of trouble and yous join the opposition. - Get yourself together, Patsy. You're not performing for the troops now! - Yous are fuckin' horny bitches so yous are! - Here, you, you watch your dirty mouth! - Ah, you wash your fuckin' dirty neck! [women laugh] - Back from your forge? - Ladies, please can we deal with this calmly and put our questions to the chair? [women shout] - [Patsy] And shut your bib for a start! - Look, I am just as angry as you are. Mary McCoy was a friend of mine! - Yeah, and she wasn't shot by the army! - Eileen Curran was blown up by the fuckin' army! - I want the army activity contained just as much as the IRA! - The British army don't live in Anderson's Town. - No, but we do! - Yes, we live here! - Or we're trying to! - The IRA are just defending their homes! They have a right! Those women don't live here. Come on, girls! [women shouting] [solemn guitar music] [girls chattering] - So did he kiss you then? - No, but he talked to me. - He doesn't like being kissed. What? [boat horn honks] - That's where they built the Titanic. [seagulls cawing] They painted "No Pope" here on the side. - Lucky Pope. [men laughing] - Seriously. - Would you like another one? - No. - Yeah. - She's not used to it. - I've only had two glasses. - [Bernie On TV] It's not a very good example for the young ones, is it? How do you think the IRA would react? - [Journalist] Is this a move to get the IRA out of Anderson's Town? [women shouting] - Not exactly. - She's a traitor. [women shouting] - [Man] Boys. Boys, look at your women on the television. She's in bad form. - And when there are children around. And civilians. And after all... [women shouting] You can't speak out on your own estate. - [Man] You can't have peace at the expense of freedom and justice. - I have a right to bring up my children in peace! - She has the same name as you. - She's my Ma. [boys laugh] - She was mad. [boys laugh] Slainte! - Slainte! - Slainte. - Cheers. [somber guitar music] [door rattles] - Bernie. Did I see your face, Bernie? Were you not just on the six o'clock news attacking the IRA? - Ah, those journalists twist everything. - Look, you only had to say no. You said, "not exactly." - I know but I didn't just mean it was the IRA was the problem. I blamed the army too. - No, you didn't. You didn't say anything about the army. - No, but I was edited. - Jesus, Bernie, I hope this is only a bad dream. [phone receiver rattles] Jesus. [dog barks] - There was a head over the fridge. And it just turned round at the last minute. - Ma was on TV. - I know. - She's gone to another meeting. - Ah, Christ, Thomas, are you mad? Why'd you let her out? - What do you want me to do? Board up the door? - Forget it, that woman's always screwing up my life. - Here, she comes. - What's going on, Mother? - There's been a coup. - A coup? - We formed a peace group. [toast crunches] We're just going on TV to make it clear we're a group of concerned residents trying to make the streets safer for our children. - That's not what it looks like. It looks anti-IRA instead of pro-peace. - [Brendan] Did you see what Mrs. French called yous? - [laughs] Nobody takes any notice of her. [girls chattering] - I don't think I can handle this. I don't mean handle, I mean cope. - You mean handle. - My shoes are missing. Oh, Christ, I didn't sleep a wink. - He kissed me. He really kissed me. - You can say that after what's happened? - Why, what's happened? - Your mother has no right to bring middle class Protestants into Andy Town. - But she didn't. - She let the Catholics down in front of everybody. - Who wrote this? - I did. - I helped her. - If you say that, you'll not get into trouble. - Now, Mrs. McPhelimy, you were critical of the IRA. - No, I said, we need the IRA to defend us. And we need them to maintain law and order in Anderson's Town because we can't rely on the RUC. - So now you're being critical of the police. What is it that you want? - No, I'm saying since the formation of the provisionals, the crime level on the estate has dropped. - The Provisional IRA shot Mrs. McCoy. - Yes, the IRA shot Mrs. McCoy, and I condemn them for that, but what I want is to try to get them to reschedule the shooting. - So you don't mind if they shoot people. It's just a question of the time of day? - Don't put words into my mouth. - It's okay, we can cut that out. It's all right. What is your immediate plan of action, Mrs. Gorman? - [clears throat] Well, we intend to seek a meeting with the IRA in Anderson's Town to ask for their cooperation. - [Journalist] Do you think you'll succeed in that? - [Deirdre] Well, if they value the support of the people. - Do you speak for the people of Anderson's Town, Mrs. McPhelimy? - Very definitely. [boys shouting] [sticks clashing] [boys shouting] [stick thudding] [Brendan groaning] - [Boy] Tell your Ma to keep her fuckin' mouth shut. [whistle blows] - Annie, you're late. - I know, sorry about that. - [Teacher] Oh, Romeo, Romeo. Wherefore art thou Romeo? Misunderstood because Shakespeare did not mean where. Girls, girls. He meant why? Because Romeo was a Montague and Juliet was a Capulet. And those two families just... [girls singing] [loud choral music] [funereal piano music] [girls laughing] [footsteps thudding] - [Bernie] It all started with that wee meeting at the school. - [Aidan] So why didn't you pull out when you saw what was happening? - I meant to. I was just trying to correct the first wrong impression on TV, but I was blaming the IRA for everything. - Bernie, you went on TV again, claiming that you represent the people of Anderson's Town against the IRA. Now that is a big mistake. You're not elected, and you're not the IRA. You can't win this. - I don't want to win. I just want a decent life for my kids. - For your kids, holy Jesus, Bernie. I was afraid to mention the kids. I thought you'd forgotten them. - If you're gonna shout at me, I'm going home. The Bishop of Down and Connor is right behind us. - Ah, fuck the bishop. You tell the bishop from me that I'd prefer he was standing in front of yous considering where we live. - [Nurse] Blood pressure, Mr. McPhelimy. - They better get Tony to put up some bulletproof grass inside the front door. [shoes clacking] [birds chirping] [shoes clacking] - So you got away from the dragon? - Thanks for ringing. - Got her on the phone the first time. So I pretended I was selling double glazing. Trouble was, she was very interested. [Annie laughs] What is it? - We used to come here every Sunday on our way to the Botanics. My mother used to stand me on this wall and say, "That's Queens University, Annie. "That's where you're going when you grow up." - So was that her ambition or yours? Come on. - Where we going? - Come on. [birds chirp] I was about 16. July, and it was really hot, and I was selling ice cream in Portrush, when Paisley turns up to address this big meeting. I'd never heard him talk before, so I stayed behind to listen. He is a powerful orator, and he starts going on about Romanism and the evils of Rome rule. Vianni's Italian Ice Cream is written all over the side of the van. Then it occurred to me that sooner or later they were gonna make the connection between Italy and Rome. No use pretending it was Mr. Whippie. - So what'd you do? - That's when I turned on the chimes. The crowd parted like the Red Sea. Nobody could hear a word. - Stop looking at me like that. - I wish I could go to a room with you and lie down. - I have to go soon. [clock ticking] [helicopter propellers whipping] [footsteps thudding] [distant bottle rattling] [clock ticking loudly] [footsteps pattering] [floor creaking] [glass shatters] - Fuck! Kristallnacht! - That was our front window. - Nobody move. [footsteps thudding] [dog barking] [doorknob clicks] [door creaking] [dog barking] - I came here to make it clear that I will not be intimidated into silence by my neighbors. - But you had your windows broken. - Yes, I did, but I didn't come here to complain about that. I came here to issue a challenge to the IRA to talk to me. - [Host] But what would you say to the IRA if you met them? - Well, I'd say I was bringing up four children in what looks like the front lines of a battle zone. We're hostages, so we are. And we're used as hostages. It's a very cowardly way to run a campaign, using young families as cover, and it's got to stop. - [Host] Do you believe you'll succeed in getting them to talk to you? - I'd like to see if they possess the courage it takes to make peace. I'm throwing down a gauntlet here today. We're the people you're so fond of saying you represent. We're the people you say you exist to defend. So what have you got to lose in talking to me? You know where to find me, talk to me. Talk to me. [gunshots blasting on TV] - Go easy on the Valium. You need to keep your wits about you. - I wish you'd stay in the hospital. God, would you turn that bloody TV off? Is it any wonder I'm on the hydro? - Well, you're off to talk to the IRA, and you're giving out about them watching a cowboy film. Jesus, that's smart. - It's a question of setting an example! I'm trying to take the gun outta politics here. - Yeah, you wanna set a better example, don't go. [hand knocks] [American Indian hooting on TV] - Oh no, that'll be Nora. She always raps on the window. Thomas, go on, let her in. [American Indians shouting] - I'm not staying. - Oh, what is it? - It's from our Dezzie. He made it in the Cash. It's for you. - Oh. I didn't know our Dezzie was so talented. - No. Neither did he. He's off the drink and learning Irish. It's the best thing that ever happened to him. Oh, I won't be in too big a hurry to get those boys outta jail. - Oh! - Hi, Aidan. Glad to see you looking so well. It'll enhance your bag. It's from me. It's just to help you out. - Oh, no, you shouldn't. [phone rings] - Is that the phone? - [Family] No. - Will you have a cup a tea, Nora? There's Annie to make it for ya. Look, I'm on my way. [lips smacking] Come on. Will anybody wish me luck? - Ask him who orchestrated the brick through your window? - Who orchestrated the brick? - [Aidan] Aye. [gunshots blasting on TV] [car door bangs] - He opened the door for her. - She'll like that. - Where are you off to? - I have an opera rehearsal. [motor humming] - Are you not gonna blindfold us? - I don't think that'll be necessary. - Are you from Cork? - You'd be wise not to ask questions, Missus, under the circumstances. - Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't being nosy. It's just that I went to Cork on the honeymoon. [men laugh] - I'd rather they blindfolded us, you know? - [Man] Do you want them out, boss? - [Officer] Only a minute, let me check 'em. Let me check 'em. - Stay clam. - [Officer] Right then, clear them, go. - [Officer] Right, drive on, please.

[laughs] [man laughs] - Well. [clears throat] We're a bit short of time, and there's quite a lot to get through. I thought I might just kick off. - It's the brick that came through my window. Now I want to know, did you conduct it or what? - Did we what? - Did you orchestrate it? - Why, did someone suggest that we did? - We criticized you, and Bernie's windows got broken. The suspicion is there without anyone suggesting it. It's a simple yes or no. - Those people were not acting on the authority of the Republican movement. Now, we have already given a warning there. But if you are not satisfied. - No, no, I am. I'm satisfied. - The army are getting very fly. They've stopped the night patrols. And now they're saturating the place during the day. Now, obviously we can't let them do that. - This is a housing estate, Connor, not a battlefield. - Do you have a strategy yourself? - Well, no. [match hisses] - Well, it might be an idea. If your group were to go to Mr Whittington and explain our position, we would certainly be prepared to do something about the shooting in the area. - [Bernie] What could go wrong? - Well, the only reason the British government would talk to you is because the IRA sent you. You have no authority of your own. - Well, I give myself the authority as a mother. - Okay, okay. That went fast. Be careful what you agree to. Somebody always shoots the messenger. - [sighs] Why are you so negative all the time? You didn't use to be. - Do you wanna come to bed? You never seem to want to come to bed. - You're always so ill.

Yes, they did, and I have them here somewhere. [zipper clatters] - Well, I think I remember them and-- - No, no, no. - Oh no, wait, no, I have it now. That's it. Right. Right, number one.

We're not politicians. - But you're not just a spokesman for the IRA, are you? - No, we just want peace. - Oh no, there was one more thing. They're going to call a ceasefire. - The IRA are going to call a ceasefire? - Yes. - Yes. - If you meet with our conditions. - They don't mean it. - Do they not? - Do you have any ideas of your own as to how we can move forward? - Well, we could start by stopping the raids on innocent homes. - How do you know they're innocent? - Sean Morris lives opposite me. He was lifted. Now, he's not involved in anything. - Yes, but how do you know that? - He's a quiet, wee man. He has a handicapped daughter. He has no time for politics. - You are talking about a very small group of people who are gunmen. The vast majority of people are not involved. - And if you keep raiding the homes of innocent people, you'll drive the youth into the IRA. - I'm sure we could look into the case. Perhaps you'd let Jeremy have the details? - All right, certainly. - And any others that you might know of. [lock clatters] - Can I clean this room now? - Yes.

More tea? - Oh, yes please. - Two for the price of one. - My real interest is in you and what the peace campaign will do to influence the IRA. - Well, we thought of going to the people on the estate. - We were thinking of a petition. - A petition? - Yeah. - A petition, yes, that's a good idea. A petition. That might be just the sort of thing one would need. What do you think, sir? - I think that'd be absolutely splendid. Absolutely splendid. [door bangs] - My husband wouldn't let me. [door bangs] [doors slam] - Yeah, of course, I'll sign, Bernie. But there's no way I'm going around the doors collecting signatures. - Well, that's all right, Sadie. We're collecting at the doors of the church as well. So I was wondering if you'd like to come down and-- - No, sorry, I couldn't. - Okay. Thanks. [doors slamming] - Don't ask me. Our Roy works for Protestants. - [Bernie] What's that gotta do with it? - Well, I don't wanna get involved. - [Bernie] You don't get peace if you don't get involved, May. - I'll sign as long as I can remain anonymous. [doors slamming] - [Deirdre] We're not getting anywhere, should we give up? - [Bernie] No, Mary McCoy didn't have the choice. [shoes clacking] [dog barking] [Bernie gasps softly] - You know what I'm going to do to you? I'm going to put a bullet in your head, and then I'm gonna string your body up on that lamppost outside your house for your kids to find in the morning. You'll not drink any more cups of tea with Jeremy. You'll not make any more phone calls to George. You're a dead bitch. [gun clicks] [footsteps thudding] [dogs barking] - [Bernie] I don't know if I'll make it home tonight. You may be the last person to see me or speak to me. - Bernie, tell me what's happened. - Someone has just threatened to shoot me and hang me up outside the house for the kids to find. - This is too serious. Let's get out of here. We'll go next door to my house and ring Aidan. - No, Aidan mustn't know. You're not to tell anyone what I've told you. I'm in confession. But if I'm shot, I want you to promise you'll preach a sermon saying I'm a peacemaker not an informer. - I promise. - And you should not let the kids see me like that. You'll cut me down after I'm dead. You'll cut my body down. - I will. [shoes clacking] [footsteps thudding] [Bernie gasping] [boys shouting] [solemn guitar music] - Mary, I need a small miracle. I'd like to thank Brother Damien for allowing me to speak to you on this prize day. I'm speaking to you as a parent. I have two children at this school. I'm very proud of my children and not very proud of myself. And I know from looking at the prizes [clears throat] spread out in front of me, that you must be very proud of your children. But you ought to be ashamed of yourselves because we failed this generation. Every time a soldier is shot, we keep quiet. Every time a civilian is shot, we condemn the security forces. We're so predictable. I'd like to see a real change. I'd like to see us have the humanity to condemn the shooting of a soldier. I'd like to see the army show real regret over the shooting of civilians. You have a chance to make the first move. On your way out of here today, you can either stop and sign the peace petition or pass by and fail another generation. Thank you.

But I understand you did have some hostility at the beginning. - Oh, well, say yes, that's grist for the mill, isn't it? But the more hostility I encounter, the more determined I become. - But you have actually changed people's attitudes. - I have tremendous energy, and I'm a fighter. And I do know one thing. You can't have peace without a fight. Yes, fame is very strange. I mean, absolute strangers think they know you. But my feet are firmly on the ground. But not a lot of people could handle that.

[gunshot blasting] I don't think there's anything significant in this area. It's where they usually start. Here, let's get him sat up. - You take the other arm. [Aidan groans loudly] - [IRA Man] Jesus, Aidan. - For God's sake, somebody help him. Do something. - Can we have a bit of help here, Owen, please? - Here. Keep his airway clear. - Owen's a medical student. He's in safe hands. - Holy Mother of God, don't you go tripping out on me know, girl. Get ahold of yourself, Annie. - The ambulance is on its way. - But they won't get through! All the roads are blocked. They are two burned out buses at the Christian Brothers. What do we do? - We'll take you to the hospital ourselves, Mrs. McPhelimy. If the ambulance is not here in a couple of minutes. - No, Tony. Get over the back fence into Dezzie Martin's garden. Go through the house, Dezzie will help you. Go on, Kieran! - He's right, it's time you were gone. - Well, maybe we should move him up onto the sofa. - He'll be all right where he is! [hand knocking] - Fuck! It's the army. - Ah, shit. - It's the ambulance man. - Thomas, you get the door. Kieran, we're leaving here now. Come on. Come on, Kieran, come on!

And I hate you. - Have you taken something? - Yeah. I've swallowed the rest of the Valium in your bottle. - Oh God. - And I also want you to know that I'm counting the days until I can leave you. - Come on, out, walk. Right and walk, now. - You don't want peace, Mother. You just want the publicity. - You're a stupid, stupid girl. - Do you have any idea what your attention-seeking behavior has meant to the rest of us? - How many did you take, six or 10? - You've destroyed us! You've killed your own family. You're the stupid one! - My God, how dare you make me responsible? - You are responsible, you cow! Do you know that Sinead cries herself to sleep every night because of you? Do you know the Brother Damien lets Brendan and Thomas leave school 20 minutes before the bell, just so that they make it to the front gate in one piece? And me, Mother, I'll never forgive you for what you did to me. - No more! [Annie retches] [liquid splashes] - There is no more, Mother.

[church bells chiming] [door bangs] - Aidan, why are you so angry with me? - I'm not angry with you, love. I'm angry for you. I think you've been given the run around. - Oh no, I like Whittington.

[people shouting] - Bridget? - Out, out, out! - Honey, go around to tell Tony what's happening. - I'm not leaving yous. - Go on, we're depending on you! [people shouting] - You forged those signatures! - That's nonsense and you know it! - I don't know anybody else that signed it, do you? - No! - I only know one who done sign it, but God love her. She's not all there! [people laughing] Bernie, who do you think you are? - Who gave you the right to speak for us? [women shouting] [Bernie shouts] [people shouting] [somber guitar music] [footsteps thudding] - Dino! Dino! Dino, help us. [fist banging] [stone rattling] [dog barking] I need help. - [Dino] Who is it? - [Annie] Why is peace such a dirty word? - We think the Brits are unleashing the petition, and whoever hasn't signed it is suspected of supporting the IRA. - [Annie] I don't believe you. - [Owen] It doesn't matter what you believe. - [Annie] No, they're in the house. [people shouting] - Let her go! Let her go! [people shouting] - Dad! [weapon thuds] [Annie gasps] [body thuds] [dog barking] - What have you done? What have you done to my son?

You say that, he won't get better. - You can forgive them, I won't. - If you don't forgive them, you can't forgive me. - I do, I do. - The one thing I have to be proud of, my children aren't full of hate. I want you to promise me you'll forgive them now. Promise. - I do. I do forgive them. I do. - Forgive me. - I do. [Bernie cries] [footsteps thudding] - Ms. McPhelimy, do you want a sedative? - I want to draw the screens around. - [Nurse] I can't let you do that. - Does everybody have to see us like this? - I wouldn't be able to see the other children's beds. [footsteps thudding] [Bernie sighs] [girls chattering] [footsteps thudding] [girls chattering] - It's only an exam. - For which you've worked very hard. - She's in no fit state. Can she not take it another time? - They'll make her wait till next year. - I think she should go, Bernie. - I don't mind what she does. - Is that true? - Oh, for Christ sake. Why is everybody making me responsible for everything that happens? Do the exam because you want to do it or don't. It's nothing to do with me. [footsteps thudding] [door creaks] [shoes clacking] [shoes clacking] - I haven't got a pen. Can anyone lend me a pen? [shoes clacking] [shoes clacking] - My words, what a triumph for you. - Oh, aye, it is. We rung those signatures outta the people of Anderson's Town, Mr. Whittington. - Have you ever considered a career in politics, Mrs. McPhelimy? - I won't even have a life, Mr. Whittington, unless you keep your part of the bargain. - Oh, please call me George. - The raids are still continuing. - Yes, I promise you, Mrs. McPhelimy. We are dealing with that. - You will appreciate that it takes a little time for our information to filter through to forces on the ground. - What are you talking about? What information? I want the raids stopped for everybody, not just the people who signed the petition! [shoes clacking] [Deirdre whispering] - We wish to thank the people of Anderson's Town for having the courage to stand up and be counted among the peacemakers. I am delighted to be able to hand this over to the, sorry, the Paramilitary Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, as an expression of the desire of the Catholic people of West Belfast for peace. - Mr. Whittington! - Mrs. Gorman! [journalists shouting] - Does this petition mean... Does this petition mean that the majority of people in Anderson's Town do not support the IRA? - No comment. - [Journalist] But Mrs. McPhelimy, if the majority want peace, they don't want the IRA. Isn't that so? - Are you remedial or just deaf? I said no comment. - I think that's enough for now. The Secretary of State will be making a statement shortly. Thank you, gentlemen. [journalists shouting] - We're doing your job for you, Mr. Whittington. - You've done very well. Very well, indeed. [camera lenses clicking] [soft guitar strumming] [soft guitar music] - Tony got lifted by the army last night, and your daddy thinks it's my fault. - You have to do what you thinks right. - Even his sisters in Australia know about it. Wrote 'em a letter, but he won't show it to me. - Look, who gives a shite what they think. - It's all right for them, sitting in Melbourne. Giving money to the provost to keep the home fires burning while they live in peace. Oh! Mary, dear. Mary, dear. I should have gone with her. You know, to the St. Patrick's Day Parade in New York. - [Annie] What are you talking about? - Mary McCoy, every year she went, and every year she asked me to go with her. - I don't think you'd be very welcome there, Mother. - [laughs] No. Not exactly good luck for people, am I? Tony said that young fella that helped us that night got lifted as well. The medical student, what was his name? - Don't remember his name. - Owen. That was it. Owen, right? [floor creaks] [somber guitar music] [men chattering softly] - What's it like out? - It's raining. - Is it? Love this amount of rain. - What's your real name? - Dino. - Was that a cover? - You mustn't do that. Mix things together that don't go. - I mustn't do that. - You've gotta learn to separate things out. You were my girlfriend. You were my real girlfriend. - I was in love with you. - What? Do you think I shouldn't have gotten involved with you because I got involved with them? - You should have told me. - Like you told me about Bernie? Bernie is a very big person. She'll be all right, you know? So will you. - Do you want me to wait? - No. Don't wait. Nobody should ever wait for anybody. Get out there, McPhelimy. - I have to go. - Indeed, you do. [chair legs scrape] It's been nice talking to you. - That story. The one about the chimes. - [Dino] The ice cream car. - Was that true? - Yes. - Good. See ya. [shoes clacking] - See ya. [birds chirp] [shoes clacking] - Did you ever hear the likes of that new girl's tongue? She'll not get far in a university using language like that! - Here, do you want me to like break in like whenever they go? - What? - Just to see if they've left us anything useful. - And get yourself kneecapped! You fucking stupid bastard moron, you! Wait till it gets dark first. - [Annie] Where we're moving to, is it safe? - Safe, what's safe? Sure no one can hurt you like your own. I resigned from the peace movement this morning. - Well, you started it, let somebody else take it up now. - I wasn't wrong, Annie. Because I was naive, doesn't mean I was wrong. - No, you weren't wrong. - No, I'm talking about the petition. I wasn't wrong to collect those signatures. I'd do it again. Even if I fail again. - You didn't fail us, Mother. We just didn't have your strength. - Look at my boys. I've hurt my boys, and I never meant to. [cries] - Would you make me a dress like this? Why is Mommy crying? - She's worried about the boys. - Yeah, I know. Can we go now? - Yeah. Mommy, look. [gentle guitar music] - Oh. God bless you, Mrs. Morris. [gentle guitar music] [door bangs] - I'll just go back in and check. - Don't go back in. - Yeah, you're right. - What do you think you forgot? - Make's no difference now anyway. I remembered you, didn't I? [chuckles] Oh, here's Nora. - I hope she hasn't brought us anything from the cash. I've no more room. - I'm sorry. I'm late. - Oh, that's all right. Now, how's Dezzie? - I didn't see him. - You didn't see him? - He's gone on the run. - What, he's escaped? - No, no, he's gone on the run in the prison. [Aidan laughs] - Right, come on, let's get in. - Hey, kids! - Hey, Auntie. - Hey, Aunt Nora! [truck door bangs] - [Aidan] How in the name of God do you go on the run in prison? - [Nora] He sleeps out in different cells each night. They just haven't been able to find him. - [Bernie] Oh, isn't that our Dezzie all over?
