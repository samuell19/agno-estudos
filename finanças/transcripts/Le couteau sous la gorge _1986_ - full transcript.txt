- Are you ready? - Almost. What's this cunt doing? We're not going to wait all night! And are you sure your guy is aware of everything? - Yeah, no problem. With all the dough I gave him... - You mean the dough I gave him. Excuse-me, your dough. I hope she'll have a good excuse. I've been raped. By three men under a carriage door. Look what they've done to me. I swear I tell the truth. Poor thing: attacked by three men! Any descriptions? I couldn't see them, it was too dark. What's all this mess about? - She's been raped. - Again! Twice in a month is a bit too much, don't you think? Next time, I'll charge you for offense to police agents. Take care of her. Come on. Come with me. The embassy's secretary. They've been threatened again, the security should be strengthened. So? So? Tell them they can go f... Send more men... And get rid of the girl. Miss Valerie Landis? Inspector Veber, police station of the Parks. Do you know Catherine Legrand? - Yes. - Does she work for you? - What happened? Nothing serious but it could becomes to if she'd do it again. So just keep an eye on her, we got more important things to do. Very well. Thanks. Yes, I know... I'm sorry. She did it again. The cops are putting her in a taxi. She'll be here soon. Say, J.B., is the keeper going to mess up with us? - No, don't worry. Anyway he wouldn't be tough to deal with. I'll go have a look. Hey buddy, we come for the photos, as planed. Sorry we're late but it's gonna be fast. Look at me, Catherine. Yes, perfect... Like this... Turn a bit... Florence, turn a bit... Yes, good... Yes, be sensual... More than that. Yes, like this! Again. So sensual! Oh, you're beautiful! Come closer to the tombstone. You can't do that! You took the money so leave us alone, okay? - That's not what we agreed. - Do your bosses know you're renting the place at night? But you can still watch if you want. - Let's go back to it. - Sure, let him enjoy the show! Come on, girls, arch your backs for the gentleman! They really don't need much to be shocked! Come on, I'll take you to lunch. J.B., did you take care of the luggage? - Yes, they're in the trunk. - Girls, do you have your plane tickets? - Yes, Valérie. We've been on a trip before, you know? - Yes, but last time, when you arrived at the airport, the plane was already far away. Please, don't get mad! At what time do we have to be at the airport? - 5:50 p.m. We've plenty of time. Bitch! Do you know two girls living together here? They are models. - The models? They're off to the States to make some photos. - ls it? Come back in a month. Let me go! Hello. Hello. If you think it's funny, I don't! Oh, it's you, Annie. You scarred me. - I brought the keys back and the mail. Put that on the table. Annie... I brought you something from the States. - Thanks, Miss. New York is really frightening, I was afraid of stepping out of the hotel. You always feel like someone is watching you. Hello... Hello! If it's a joke, it ain't funny... - It's not a joke, bitch! I'm watching your photos, and do you know what I'm doing in the same time? I'm sure you know it. You must be used to having people using your photos as kleenex. I'm watching your photos, and do you know what I'm doing in the same time? I'm sure you know it. You must be used to having people using your photos as kleenex. I'm your neighbour. I've been attacked. - Attacked? Not really... Some phone calls and someone was trying to break-in... And then a power cut, and... What are you doing? I'm calling the police. No, don't bother them for that. On the other hand, if you don't mind taking me back to my place... That's nothing. The circuit breaker just switched off. - Hi! - Stop that, J.B., you're tiresome. What's wrong, Cathy? You're white as a sheet. It's nothing. The circuit breaker switched off once again. I've been afraid. Oh, she's been afraid! Poor little Catherine! Stop drinking, J.B.! It's late, you should go back home. No way! We own the night, my dear! - A neighbour helped me with the circuit breaker. It was nothing, after all. - Do we know him? - No, he probably moved in during our trip. - What does he look like? - It's him. Nicolas Vereau. I live a studio flat across the corridor. I heard some noise and... You've been fooled! She's a looney! A mythomaniac. She did that already a hundred times! Isn't it? Darling! Now that everything's back in order, I... Ah no! You can't leave like this! Such a heroic conduct must be celebrated! So... What are you doing... Mr Hero, when you're not rescuing young girls in distress? I'm doing an architecture degree. Well... If you don't mind, I have a scale model to finish. Stop it! Please, not tonight. Stop it, you're hurting me! I'm not hurting you. Come on, are you gonna smile? Come on smile! SMILE! If you don't smile, J.B.'s gonna be pissed off. And he's maybe gonna want to publish Florence's pictures. And if those pictures are published, Florence's gonna have big problems. SMILE! The reportage we've done in New York is a sensation! They find it "so french"... Hey, you girls don't seem to feel very well. Pull yourselves together. It's gonna be the Japan campaign soon. It's a very important market. I asked J.B. to do the photos. Can't we change for a new photographer? I've nothing to do with your affair with J.B. He's a great photographer. He has an eye for sensational images. Hello... Yeah, hold on, please. Please Stéphane, somebody asks the lady in black on the phone. Miss, there's a phone call for you. - I'm worrying about Catherine. - Why? Did she do it again. Yes, last night. Hello... Hello... So what? Don't you kiss your ex-boyfriend? The boyfriend you used to love so much. You're doing pretty well now. I can see your photos everywhere. They ain't very good. There's better to do out of that. Lots better. You make good money now. So you're gonna help me. In remembrance of the good old days. Hello. You called Catherine and Florence but we're not home right now... So your kid sister was calling you at the restaurant? It's kinda weird. She knows it's a place I go often. She had to talk to me about an important matter. - I thought you had no family left. - It's not exactly my sister. You don't believe me, do you? You think I'm lying, one more time. ls it true you were assaulted last night? He has been attacked! Answer me, answer me! Florence, call the cops, quickly! No, better call an ambulance! Don't move, we're gonna taking care of you. - Hello? It's for an emergency, I don't know his name, he's a neighbour. It's gonna be okay. So you opened the door, you got it right in the gob and you woke up surrounded by three beautiful creatures and all your scale models were in bits and pieces? - Yes, I told you all I know. - That's not much. Thanks. It's forbidden to smoke. The rules apply for everybody. I'll put one of my men on the case. But go find a specific looney among all the looneys walking in the streets! Just an advice... - Yeah, go ahead. Never mind. - Are you feeling better? - I do. They told me I can leave tomorrow. That's a good news, I was worrying. Here. It's for you. - It's very nice of you. What happened is all by our fault... I mean by my fault. They went to the wrong apartment, that's the girls they wanted to attack. Don't worry anymore, I'm gonna take care of you. Spend a few days at my place is what you need. Some kind of convalescence. You know, this kind of incidents is common in our job. We provoke, they react. I wish I had met you in less dramatic circumstances. Get yourself something to drink, I'm having a bath. Don't worry, I won't be long. Do you like it here? - Yes, it's comfortable and reassuring. Don't you have anyone to tell you're out? No girlfriend? No, I don't have a girlfriend. You're beautiful, Valerie. Dangerous to socialized with, but beautiful. Isn't it an exciting combination? What an honor! Valérie is visiting us! She's maybe worrying for us. - No, she's just taking her protege back home. She doesn't give a shit about what could happened to us. - I believe you already know each other. - Hello. Hello. Our sweet neighbour looks fine. He recovered quite fast. Valérie must be a fine nurse. - J.B., can we start soon? It's friggin‘ cold! - Yeah, yeah. Just give me a second. Ask your boyfriend to warm you up! It's freezing here. - Hey buddy, hurry up. - Yeah, yeah... What's gonna be J.B.'s next brilliant idea after this? It's just slightly less sordid than New York's docks. Come on, girls! Come on, girls, hurry up! Let's go before he turns hysterical. Come on, show a bit of nerve! Take position. - What the fuck are they doing over there? - Photos. They're fucking annoying. Florence, stand a bit more on the side... Fuck, we need to put some life in it... You, here... Come on, come on! Take this. You'll see, it's gonna be fun! Here we go. Let's gonna turn them on. I said let's gonna turn them on. Take your cover boy's hand and put it closer of your breast. He's no good enough for you, is that it? I've seen you on photos with better looking partners indeed! And more famous. - Stop it, J.B. - Don't tell me what to do! Yeah, Florence the exhibitionist who was fucking with a deputy, with a heart condition! But J.B. was there with his camera. J.B.'s always there! I'm fed off of your photos and your shitty magazines! - Are you talking to me, bitch? - Leave her alone, J.B. Here's the mythomaniac who wants to interfere! J.B., stop it now. You're really a scumbag. So why are you always asking me for your photos? Jesus, you can't come in now! Close that fucking door! What do you want? No! No! Stop pretending you're sad, Florence. You asked me to change photographer. Then, it's done! - What's new, inspector? - The investigation is in process. A tough case: he had nothing but enemies! We can't say there's masses of people to take him to his last resting place. And you being here doesn't necessarily mean that you liked him. - Inspector, it's urgent. - Yeah, I'm coming. Here... For you. - For me? - Yeah, for you. See you tomorrow morning. An attempted attack against the embassy. They're waiting for you. Nicolas, what's with you? I'm cold too. I want to change clothes before to go dinner. See you tomorrow, girls. Try to be there on time and in shape. Florence, I hope your appointment with that cop won't be too long. Japanese are strict on punctuality. "For matter of your concern." - You think they found your photos? - I don't know. I don't know but I'm afraid. There's no more reason to be afraid. What's wrong, Nicolas? You seem distant. Stop it, I hate that. I'm sorry. It's because of that dreadful death.. And that obnoxious cop... His behaviour with Florence and... - And Catherine. You got a crush on that mythomaniac, right? I hope you had a good night. Where you alone? I bet you weren't! Girls like you never sleep alone! How many were they? Two? Five? Twelve? Not thirteen I hope, it's bad luck. Fear is turning you on, right? Then you're gonna be happy. Very happy. I got some surprises for you. I love to surprise people! Hello, Miss. I'm going to take care of Mrs Lamont's flowers. The tenant who has a terrace on the floor above. Have a good day, Miss. Stay together. I'm going to call you. I think you better take off your scarf. Ah, here they come. I hope you're gonna measure up, Eric. They're here. - How was it? Not too hard? - No, actually he has been very nice: no slapping, no clubbing in the stomach... He just yelled a bit. He doesn't know there's a difference between cover girl and call girl. - Did they know about the photos? - No... I mean I don't think so. He let me go because I had to work but I'll have to go back there. Anyway, J.B.'s death is not a big loss for him. He told me a photographer that... - Florence. Can you come with me? - Yes. You, try to look not too ugly. Let me introduce you Florence. Hello. Catherine, I need money. I really do. Catherine, don't make me beg you. I need cash. I need cash, Catherine. I need money. I need it... - Get lost! Get lost! Fuck! I'm the one who gives orders! I'm the one, my love! You got to help me! You got to help me! My love... Help me! Help me, please... Stop it! Kiss me. Stop it! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Are you okay? You filthy whore! He knows what you brought to me. That's why he wants to be the next one. - Get lost! Get lost! How touching! Watch out, Catherine, he really hates when someone touches his hair. But I see he didn't had the time to warn you. - That's not what you think. Please, trust me. - "Trust"? I thought that was a word you never heard of. I'm not an innocent, like him. Calm down. Calm down. It's just a nightmare. It's nothing, calm down. But all the rest is true, right? Valérie and J.B. are really dead. I'm not making that up, right? - You're not making up anything. But who could had wanted to kill them? The police thinks that... They believe it might be your ex-boyfriend. Ludovic? Why he would kill them? He had no reasons. He's sick, Catherine. Unpredictable. He's a known drug addict. Come on, try to sleep now. - No, I don't want to sleep. Thanks. Bad news? It's my father. Nothing alarming. He just wanted to let me know. I'm on my way. - How far is it? - It's outside Paris. - Can I come with you? - No. Take my car. I'll be back tomorrow in the afternoon. - Nicolas... - Yes. - I'd like to meet your father. - You'll meet him soon, I promise. You took her from me! She's mine, hear me? Mine! She's mine! "Catherine, I need some money. I really do... She's a looney. A mythomaniac... "Trust"? Do you even know what does it mean?" Hello, Studio Victory? Can I speak to Miss Florence Guerlan, please? Florence, it's me, I'm alone, I'm afraid, Nicolas went to see his father. No, nothing serious. He was supposed to come back but I didn't hear from him. You were right, you know? I"m gonna quit this job. Nicolas is maybe the right one to start all over again with. Please, don't let me alone tonight. This apartment's really dreadful. What is he doing? Don't worry, he's gonna be there soon. Anyway, if something cropped up... - Nicolas! I have a surprise for you under the door. Call the police. The line's dead, Florence! Nicolas! Let me introduce you my father. He died because of you! Because of all that! It was easy to betray his trust! Yeah, he was of the trusting kind. He lost his mind because you used him for your nasty work! Guilty! You were all guilty! - You're crazy, stop it! - Look... He was sacrificing himself for me. I managed to rent this studio flat. And then came the first encounter... The one I was expecting. - If it's a joke, it's not... - It's not a joke, bitch! I'm watching your photos... Yeah! You filthy bitch! You cunt! After, it was easy. I quickly figured out how to operate. By using your flaws and weaknesses. I only had to pull the strings and handle you just as puppets. I really enjoyed killing all those scumbags. I'm sure that's what he'd wish. I planed everything... Except your jealous ex-boyfriend. She's mine, you hear me! She's my girl! She's mine! Are you going to leave her to me?! You're the only one left. I have to do it, Catherine. For my father. Bastard! I swear this time it's true! I swear I tell the truth, he wants to kill me! Hold on. Stop laughing! I beg you, I'm not crazy! You must believe me! Stop it! Stop it! It's the truth, it's the truth! You must believe me! - Oh, you're right in time. - It's him! It's him! - What do you mean "It's him!"? The murders, the photos, his father, everything! Calm down, Catherine, I'm taking you back home. Florence and the nurse are worrying a lot, you know? Calm down. They explained me: she's afraid of injections. But you know it's good for you. Calm down. Come on, let's go. Take her away and lock her up. I beg you, don't let me alone with him. Hello... Yes, I'm sorry... Well, okay... Calm down, everything's gonna be okay... ls the Austin yours? There's a dead body in it! - Do anything stupid and I kill her! - Nobody moves! Come on. Come on. - What happened? - A lunatic... He's dead. Who's that guy? A terrorist? Of course not! You're seeing terrorists everywhere... Take the body. Go ahead, tell me everything. But try to tell the truth, if you can. Hello.
