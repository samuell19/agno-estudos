--== McEphie ==-- [upbeat music playing] Where's the stage design? Has Morris sent it? Yes, it's here. Manu, Amanda's been calling you. She said you weren't answering. I can't understand her, but she's been calling me. My phone's on silent mode. [Bessy] Ah! You know people usually turn on their phones so they can use them? -Not put them on silent mode.That's it. -Where's the thing I asked you to do? Here it is. Here it is. Where should we put the stage in the ballroom? I will be late. I have a meeting. You? I still have to get the cake in Valle Verde. Okay. What time will Manny’s catering arrive? It'll come from BF. I'll ask Amanda what time they’ll deliver. Okay. See you later. Okay. What's the occasion at your house anyway? It's Shelly’s welcome party. The one who came home from the States. Oh. The lesbian? [chuckles] She's not a lesbian anymore. She likes men again. [giggles] Nice! Her plug has an adaptor! [all laughing] How do you do that? Hot dog… adaptor! Whoo-whoo! [laughs] What’s funny? Catering report. [people cheering] -Cheers! -Shelly, How's the American guy you're dating? Are you together already? -[Shelly] Dylan? -He has a name! He is her boyfriend now. I thought you found God. That's why you turned straight. Not really. Let's say I’m gender fluid. You’re a gender fluid. Well, I’m a brake fluid! [laughter] She means she's bisexual. Bisexual… So what if there's no gender? Still up for it? How do you do that? Ask her. [guest to Shelly] Do you think it’s okay with the Lord? No, because Dylan’s good-looking. I just want him to give me a child. She’s not after a boyfriend, but a sperm donor. [gasps] Sperm donor! What about you and Ron? Do you have plans of getting married? Us? Get married? Do you want Aunt Baby to have a heart attack? You know you can. I mean, you don't need permission of your Aunt Baby or anyone. There are couples like you who got married. -[giggles] CBCP won’t allow. -Oh my. [guests] Cheers! Cheers! Shelly, I have a question. Why do you want a baby? I want to take care of somebody. You can take care of a Chihuahua. [guests laughing] It's true, right? I just want to have my own child, but not a husband. Most of all, I’m a woman. I want to be a mother. And you and Gio? Why don’t you have a child? -She's harsh. -[In English] Remember… The body time clock! Tick tock! Tick tock! -Manu. Ron. -Yes? Have you ever done it with a girl? [Manu] With a girl? [Shelly teases] Go ahead, deny it. When we met, you were a straight guy. [Shelley giggles] Let’s not talk about that! It’s gross! You had a girlfriend before, right? Ew! Oh God! Let’s talk about something else! That’s gross! What’s wrong with that? What about you, Ron? Any experience with a girl? [guests howl] Of course! [guests] Whoa! A lot! [clamoring] [guests] Cheers! I'll leave guys now! [guests] Cheers! [in English] So… you have experience with girls, huh? And hashtag a lot. [in English] Will it make a difference? [light jazz music playing in background] None. There you go. I mean… if you had an experience with a girl before, and I had one before, it won’t make a difference to me. Is there? I’m not sure. [people chattering and laughing] [Aunt Baby] Where's Ronnie? Why is he not here yet? Auntie, he's in Bulacan having lunch with his family. [Aunt Baby] Oh. Is he? He's always like that, I can't even see him here anymore. And you? -What are you doing? Come! -Yes! We're coming! Don't be shy and eat! Don't you believe in God? Do you still pray? -Do you still believe in him? -That's too much, Auntie! Of course, I still kneel in private! Kneeling in private! Huh? [gasps] Of course, you have to kneel to pray sincerely. That's right! You have to pray because you have a messy life. What if you get married? Where are you planning to live? Tell me. Am I right? About the house you're in right now, do you give your share? Of course, I have a share on that house. If that's so, then very good, very good! So when are you planning to give me a grandchild? I really want to have a grandchild the soonest! Here, have some sausage. That's delicious! [phone ringing] [Bessy] Stage Right Productions, this is Bessy. How can I help? Let me transfer you to our accounting department for your query. [phone rings] Stage Right Productions, this is Bessy. How can I help? Stage Right Productions, Stage Right Productions, This is Bessy. How can I help you? This is Bessy. How can I help you? -Ma'am, Mr. Castillo's not here yet. -Bessy! Can I have your number so we can call you back? -Bessy! -Okay. [mumbling] [in Filipino] Okay, sir. We'll call you. Thank you very much! -Bessy. -Yes, this is Bessy. Bessy! I'm so happy, It's been years and you're still with Manu. Is Manu here? [playful music] [phone rings] Stage Right Productions, this is Bessy. Please help me! Help! Help! 911! [yelling] Manu! You witch! -What are you doing there? What is it? -Sorry. Why are you wearing that? [Bessy] This is why I'm here. -Someone left me a calling card. -It's… Confirmed in the flesh! -So what does she want? -I don't know what she wants! But she said, [in English] she will keep in touch. [Bessy mocks] [in English] So what's the problem? For years, you've been wondering whatever happened to her. So this is it. She's back! -She's the one who's looking for you! -[Manu] Exactly. What's up with that? It was eight years ago. She suddenly disappeared, and now she'll just… show up? You know, it's good you guys talk so you'll have closure! -Right? -The hell with closure! Damn it! You know what? I don't understand you. It's a good thing for both of you, so you guys can talk. Wait, you still like Monique, Huh? What feelings are you talking about? -That was back in the Japanese era! -[Karen laughs] You still feel hurt. [man] I don't know, you decide. [waiter] Hi, sir! -That's why I ask you, so I can decide! -This way, sir. You're so rude. Manuel, that can only be your decision. Karen's right. These things need closure. Can you stop calling her that? Yes, she is a girl… and she was my friend who happened to be a girl. But she was never my girlfriend. [in English] Okay. You're so annoying. [exhales] [reflective music plays] [Bessy] What now, Mamanu? Fine! Set the date with Monique. Huh? I told her that you'll decide because you're busy! That's ridiculous! Why me? -Should it be me? -So, when? It's up to you. It's driving me crazy! Tomorrow! Tomorrow? As in tomorrow? [Manu clears throat] Good evening. Reservation for Manu Castillo, please. [waitress] This way, sir. [upbeat romantic music plays] Monique. Manu. [chuckles nervously] -You look good! -Same. -Sit down? -All right. [clears throat] -[sighs] It's been like… years? -[Manu chuckles] Lots of things to catch up on. Um, first just let me… explain why I'm here and why I called for this meeting. -Monique… -Manu please, let me finish. [speaking in French] [Monique speaks in French] [in English] They have maids with them. The man was angry because there were girls in the men's room. -What? [Manu chuckles] -[Monique] Eh… Um… Manu, this is… my son, Tristan. Oh, you have a son? [Tristan speaks in French] [in English] Yes, Tristan. He is your father. Huh? [bouncy music playing] [in English] Well, hello Daddy! Manu? [Tristan speaks in French] He's not moving. Hello? So Manu, how did it happen? Do you really have to ask that? What? Immaculate Conception? [in English] Hello! How did it happen? I thought nothing happened between the two of you. So how? That's what I thought too! [in English] But… I'm not so sure. What? How can you be not sure? Well one of those nights, eight years ago, We got drunk at a party at BGC. And there! We were so wasted! Oh! So? Even if you're drunk, you should know what you do! -That's impossible! Hello? -But we drank mixed drinks. Auntie! Popcorn, please! Yes, ma'am Wait, so how sure are you that you're the father of the child? Wait. Can we… slow down? I'm confused! I got married two years ago. The reason I'm here is because my husband was assigned… to oversee the setting of the IT company he's working for in Southeast Asia. And he'll be based here most of the time, but he'll be traveling around the region. [in Filipino] I mean, it will be easy to come here from New York. How long will you stay here in Manila? It depends on my husband's work. They set us up in a house in Taguig. [in English] So, I decided that now will be the perfect time for… Tristan to meet and get to know his father. [Karen] Oh! So that's why. Thank you. She found out that she was six months pregnant. That's why she disappeared. Oh really? That's exciting! And then, sir? Then what happened? Was it really six months? Do you want to have a six-month vacation? Go back in there and cook! -[Karen] Go. -I'm sorry! That's from watching too many telenovelas! Aren't you watching too? -Of course I'm watching. -Our favorite. -I wonder what happens next? -Wait! That's what I'm saying! That melodramatic mentality is not the reason. When she was in the States, that's when she found she was pregnant. Then why didn't she tell you? What should I do? Go into labor for her? Deliver the child? You know what? It's also making me confused. Do you think Monique intended to force me into a marriage? [Monique] You had your life, I had my life. I decided to keep the baby. I didn't want to pressure you, to make you decide at that moment. So… [in English] Anyways, the reason why I agreed for Tristan to meet you… is because I want him to grow up knowing who is his biological father is. And that's you! [playful music] [Tristan speaks in French] [Monique speaks in French] Huh? [in English] Karen? Look at me. [cartoon sound] I'm not suited to be a Daddy. This isn't a good role model for a little boy. And besides, I don't know anything about sports. My expertise is in ramp modeling and beauty pageantry! Huh? What you are saying is nonsense! There are lots of people like you with biological children, and some of them adopt and make excellent parents. You know what, Manu? You can do it! You just overthink! What if he found out that his biological father is… a demure type. And how would I explain it to Ronnie? -Manu! -Hi, babe! Hello. [in English] You're here. What's up? Good thing you're here babe. I have some news for you! You wouldn't believe what big news I have for you. [scoffs] Fine! Try me! We're now Uncle and Auntie. Emily has a cousin and Manuel has a child. What? Child? As in… human? No! As in head lice! [Ronnie] So, what's going to happen? She wants the child to get to know me as his father. There's nothing wrong with that. If it's okay… He can spend few days… In our house? Okay. Well… Did you tell the mother of the child about me? No. Why not? I was surprised about the news that I have a child. My brain froze. [laughs] Okay, so… how will you tell your ex-girlfriend and the son about me? [gentle music playing] Tell me you won't ask me to go home to my parents' house while… No, it's not that. Uh… I'm going to tell them… that we're best friends. [playful music] [in English] Good luck! A seven-year-old child would understand it, right? Well, another thing. Are we going to tell it to our friends? I can handle them. They will understand. Girls, meanwhile, you'll be banned from my life. Damn you! You're ashamed of us! It's not like that. Then why are you telling us that? And who is that child anyway? My son. [all gasping] [all] You're now a mother? [gasp] -[gasps] -Your child? You did it with a girl? Manuel, that is so sick. [cries] That is so sick! Shame on you! You didn't tell us you're a lesbian! We thought all the while that you're confidently beautiful with a heart! You're making me crazy! I just have a simple request, and you are overreacting! [Ron] Whatever it is, tell me. I know you, Manuel. Come on! Say it. Spill it. Come on! Well, I don't know… how to tell you… without offending you. Try me. Well, you know that my son will sleep in our house, The problem is… where will Tristan sleep? What's the problem? We have a guest room. Oh come on, Manuel! The child can't see us sleeping in the same bed. He's only seven years old! He doesn't have malice yet! When I was at that age, I was an adolescent! I had a period and was full of malice! You're different. When you were being pulled from your mother's womb, you touched the doctor! [Manu clicks tongue] So what now? I'll be going to sleep in the master bedroom… alone? and you guys will be in the guest room? No, we'll be in the master bedroom and you'll be in the guest room alone. Thank you. I know you understand. You're so sweet! [Monique and Tristan speaking in French] [Manu] Did you have a hard time finding the address? Not really.* Wow, Daddy, you have a nice house! Nice bike, too! Wow! This is a really big house. Do you stay here alone? -[Manu] No. With a friend. -[Tristan] Wow! Friend? Best friend! [in English] Okay! I mean, that's what they call it nowadays. [in English] Wow! Books! [Monique] It's nice here. When did you move here? Um… A little over two years ago. So… your friend? Oh! Ronnie? Is he in special events too? No, he's a financial analyst. Ah. He's also a consultant in some energy firms and… he's a teacher at the Asian Institute. So, when do I get to meet him? Soon. This is where he lives, right? Yes, but not all the time. He always travels and goes home to his family in Sta. Maria Bulacan. So who owns this house? Is it you or him? Me. [in English] Um… House rules? There are house rules we have to follow. I mean Tristan is only seven years old, so, of course it's important to be consistent when it comes to rules so he doesn't get confused. -[clears throat] Rules? -Yes, they're simple. I mean… I'd like him to be in bed before 9 on weekdays, maybe 10 on weekends. He's not fond of TV, but computers, oh my gosh. He loves to read books. -Okay. -Healthy diet. Oh, Don't you worry. -You know how good I am at cooking. -Limited processed foods. No sugar. Lots of veggies. His stepfather is a semi-vegan so he really loves vegetables. Limited ice cream, limited chocolate. It's not forbidden, but a little… Wait. Wait a minute. Our child is only seven years old, right? He doesn't have hypertension yet, right? Start them young, Manu. Start them young. Seven years old? Diet? -Tristan! -Coming, Mom. Mama's gonna leave now, okay? And remember, you behave, okay? I don't want you being naughty in your daddy's house. [Tristan speaks in French] Speak English or Tagalog. He doesn't know French. [in English] Yeah, I know. He's kind and he's your daddy. Besides, they have lots of books. I'll be okay. Okay, well. Give me a hug. [delicate music playing] [Tristan chuckles] Mama… [sighs] [sighs] Okay. I guess we're all set. I'll pick him up on… Monday around lunch. I can just bring him, so let's just set a place instead. Manuel, you'll be okay. Your son is a good boy. -Right? -[chuckles] Yeah. Okay, um… -Bye-bye. -Bye, Mom! I'll walk you out. -Be good! -Yes, mom. Bye! Tristan… -Are you okay there? -I'm okay. Actually… I read this book already. Have you read this book? Well, I'm still planning to. Have you read most of the books in here? Actually… those books are not mine. They're your Uncle Ronnie's. Who? Uh… Uncle Ronnie. He's my best friend and my roommate. You will meet him later. I'd like to meet Uncle Ronnie. Maybe we can talk about his books. The flight have been confirmed. Tell him I'll meet him by 2 p.m. My wife and I are scheduled to arrive… at 11:00, that should give us plenty of time. Okay. I'll be there until Sunday evening. All right. That sounds good. I'll see you then. Okay. What happened? It's fine. [scoffs] So, was Tristan restless? No. As a matter of fact, I think his father was… way more nervous than he was. You sure about this? That's what the boy wants. He wanted to meet his father. The question is, is that what the boy needs? He is his biological father. Okay. Well, come on. Can never tell about the traffic between here and NAIA. Jay, um… -Thank you. -For what? [gentle music plays] For understanding. Come on. Jasmine, get the bags, please. [Jasmine grunts] Ouch! [Karen] So, how are you? I'm okay. Okay? Why? Is it still awkward? Hmm… a little. Karen, this child is unique. And you're surprised? Who's the father anyway? [laughs] That's not it! Hi son! Look what Daddy bought for you. [cheerful music playing] Son, can you put down your book first? Come, let's play. Snake & Ladders? Why? You don't know how to play? This is what are we going to do. I'll teach you how to play it. -Daddy. -Yes, son? That's for kids. [cheerful music continues] [Karen giggles] He said that? [Manu] Yes, he said it's for kids. And then? But if you want to play, we can still play. No need, son! So what board games do you play? Oh yes! I like Anomia, Trivial Pursuit, word games like Upward, Scrabble… Ah, your Uncle Ronnie knows how to play Scrabble. But my favorite is Timeline. Timeline? Yeah it's about history. Do you have Timeline, Daddy? Just read instead, son. We have a lot of books here. [Karen] Wait! What did Ronnie say? -[footsteps] -[yawn] Hi! Hi. Good evening, Uncle Ronnie. How do you know my name? Well, you must be my Daddy's housemate. Oh… Yes, I am your dad's housemate. Are the books upstairs yours? Most of them, but your dad owns the flower arrangements, fashion, landscaping. I own the-- History books! -Yes. -I love history. Good. You know C.S. Lewis? Of course! He's my favorite. -Oh, nice! -Nice. I already like you, Uncle Ronnie! You know, I was just reading Lord of the Rings. -Wow. -[Tristan giggles] -So who's your favorite character? -Well, uh… Just so you know, I'm scared of Gollum. -You don't like Gollum? -But… -[Tristan] Not really. [giggles] -[Ron] I like Gollum. -Yeah, it's a really nice book so far. -Yes. -Look! I baked a cake! -Wow! -Thanks, mommy! -You're the best wife! And you're the best husband! [cheerful music playing] [kissing] Bye, wife! Bye, husband! -Bye, son! -Bye! Do you want me to slice you a piece of cake? [Monique] I'm his mommy. You're not his mommy. I'm his mommy. No, you're a phony! I'm his mommy. -I'm his mommy! -No, you're not! I'm his mommy! -I'm his mommy. -I'm his mommy! -I'm his mommy! -I'm his mommy! -No, I'm his mommy! -[Aunt Baby] Who's your mommy? -I'm his mommy! -I'm his mommy! -You? -Yes! And you're gay? [Karen] Do they get along? Are you kidding me? -[Tristan] Look! -They are more like father and son. Let me join you! What's this? This one? [Karen laughing] You're so funny! I can't believe this! [Karen laughs] [Bessy yells] Frank! Is it clear, girl? -Look. -[Bessy] Thank you very much. [staff chatters in the background] Do we have more of this? He's so cute! So how old are you, baby boy? I'm seven. But ma'am, I'm not a baby. Oh, sorry. He's smart. Smart. -He got it from his… -His mother. Uh oh. And that's not you. Tristan, this is Aunt Bessy. Hi, Tristan. Yes, mother! That client's making me crazy, mother! That client is… They're complaining! Do you remember, mother? She's the same client… who asked why we only use three LED screens for later. This is making me crazy! And who is this child? Oh, Tristan. Tristan, these are your uncles. Uncle Erwin, Uncle Opet, Uncle RJ, and Uncle Ricky! Hi, guys! Uh… -Yeah, bro! That client really annoys me! -[rock music in the background] Yeah, bro! We already talk about it a while ago! Annoying, bro! I don't know, man. Get back to work, guys, or else I'll punch you! Sure! We'll take care of it. -Okay, we'll go ahead. -Bro! [indistinct chatter] Son… are you now aware of what work is? More or less. Do you have any questions? Nope. -[Opet] The flowers are too small. -[Ricky] Try cutting them. -Go, Daddy! Please! Let's play! -Not there. Let's play! [lively music playing] Yes! Whoo! -[Tristan grunts] -Shoot! Shoot! Yes! [exclaims] Oooh! -Here. -Thank you! -Are you having fun? -Yes! Shoot! Okay! Yes! Shoot! Dad! Dad? [screams] Wow! I got a bunny! You scream like a girl! It's not me! ♪ Are you ready ♪ [upbeat music] -Yes! Whoo! -laughs] Yes! -[crowd cheering] -[people clapping] Cheers. Dad, did you know that I'm not allowed to eat ice cream? That's what your mom said. But you let me have one. Are you going to tell her? No. Okay. It's delicious anyway, right? Um… Can I ask you a question? Of course! You're older than me. You can ask me any question. [Manu laughs] How is your mother's husband? Oh, you mean papa? You call him papa? Why? What should I call him? Eh… I'm your dad. So, how did he become your papa? Um… You're my daddy. He's my papa because he's married to my mama. Do you understand? -Do you understand? -Ah? Uh-- Of course, I understand, I'm your manufacturer. Huh? Oh, nothing. Just eat your ice cream. [phone ringing] Auntie, look after this please. [phone ringing] Hey! Monique! So what did you guys do today? Nothing, we're just went to places. And where are those places? Don't worry about it! Just chill and relax. So how are you and your Mr. Finance there in Hong Kong? Actually, I've been waiting for him since he's been craving Peking duck, so we planned to have dinner at Mott 32. Hey, that's good. Manu… Is everything really okay? [chuckles] Why would everything not be okay? The child is intelligent, right? Don't take all the credit. Last time I checked I'm also a co-maker. No! Daddy, are you cooking? Perfect! here's your son, I mean our son. Your Mama. Hi Mama! Hi Tristan! How's everything there? Are you being a good boy? Yes mama! Did your daddy give you ice cream, Tristan? No, Mama. [knocking] -Hey! -Huh? Ronaldo Yes? Can you just do that tomorrow? I have a deadline to meet. Where's the kid? He's in the room watching Netflix. Thank you. [peaceful music playing] Do I have a choice? None. [chuckles] Manu, take it slow, okay? About what? I don't want you to get hurt. You know that everything is temporary. [door closes] [gentle music plays] [Aunt Baby] What happened to your brother? I already texted him three times. I called three times. It says "subscriber cannot be reached". What's up with him? Auntie, he must be busy. Yes, Auntie. He is busy. Oh, there he is! Is that him? Is that him, Manuel? Who's this kid? Tristan, say hello to your Aunt Karen, Uncle Edward, and Lala Baby. Hi everybody! [everyone] Hi! Now, say it French. He knows how to speak in French? [speaking in French] Wow, he's good! Anyway, who really is this kid? Auntie, this is Tristan. My son. [cartoony sounds] Aunt Baby! Aunt Baby! Aunt Baby, are you okay? You're asking me if I am okay? How can I be okay when nobody caught me? Come on, help her up. Your reflexes are so slow! -Slowly, Aunt Baby. -What's with you, guys? Are you okay? Are you sure? Can you leave me and Manuel alone first? -Oh, okay. Let's go. -Please. What a handsome kid! My God. He's like an angel. Come here, Manuel. Sit beside me. -Just sit here! -Okay. Eh… Sorry. I know I disappointed you because… Auntie? -Are you crying? -Slightly. The truth is… [cries] [sniffles] I'm so happy. I am so happy. [sobbing-crying] Guess why. I can now deny to all our relatives their accusations towards you. All their allegations about you, everything they're saying about you is wrong! I am right. Good thing I listened to my heart. Eh, Auntie, what are they saying about me? What else? That you are gay! [sobbing] I told them that you just like baking. You just like watching Miss Universe. You know all the countries included in the Miss Universe. What's wrong with those things? What's important is that, Hmm! …you already have a son. Someone will continue our surname. -Isn't that nice? -Yes. [Ron] Isn't it funny that your aunt is still in denial about your gender? What do you want me to do? Tell her that it's not fake news that I am gay… just because I have a son? You know what, I know that she's happy right now that you have a son. Hmm? -Daddy? -[whimpers] [grunts] Uncle Ronnie, why are you on the floor? Uh, I'm just doing my obliques. Big boy. What can we do for you? [door closes] -Daddy? -Yes. Tomorrow is Monday. What time will you bring me back to my Mom? Daddy, will I see you again? Of course, why not? I will ask my mom if I can spend my weekend here again. Sure. You know I like Uncle Ronnie. Me too. [gentle music playing] Sorry, sorry, sorry. Did I make you guys wait for so long? -No, it's fine. -The traffic here is so bad! You know what, our travel from the airport was longer than traveling from Hong Kong to Manila. Traffic is part of our tourist attractions. Ugh! [Monique speaks in French] [Tristan speaks in French] -[Monique chuckles] -Aww. [Monique speaks in French] [Tristan sighs] Why do you always talk in French? Because I am French, his stepdad knows French, so Tristan should know how. Next time I'll teach him Ilocano so it will be fair. Yeah! [chuckles] -What's that? -[Manu chuckles] Nothing. Just stuff I bought for him. Why? Nothing, I just want him to be happy. -[Jason] What did you tell him? -Well… What do you want me to say? He's probably just trying to… make up for lost time. That's why he's… buying him all these presents. Oh, and… there's one more thing. Oh. He wants to see Tristan again. Yeah. Did you… well, Did you ask Tristan if he wants to see his real father again? He's okay with it. Okay. Why? Nothing. [chuckles] Okay. I, you know, just find it awkward referring to that man as his father. For as long as I remember I've always been his Papa. But… I'm just being silly. It's going to be fine. Yeah. Nothing's going to change. Hmm? Of course not. [soothing music playing] [grunts] [grunts] [sighs] [grunts] Ronald? Why don't you call him if you miss him? [whines] Are you sure it's okay? His mom said that it's fine, so what's the drama? Call him. [whines] Just call him. [phone ringing] [exhales] Hello? [Manu] Monique, good morning. Did I wake you up? Manu, what time is it? [in English] It's eight in the morning. Yes. Are you still asleep? Yes, it's already eight. That's it. It's eight. [sighs] What do you want? -Uh, Monique. -Huh? What's your plan with the kid today? [sighs] Excited to see your dad? Yeah. Hey! There he is. -Hi, Daddy! -Hi. Look what I bought for the big boy. -Wait. What is this? -Uh… Gifts. But Daddy, it's not my birthday. It's not Christmas. That's okay, son. Daddy just wants to give you gifts. [playful music] Thank you! Let's go! [Tristan speaks in French] -Okay. Go. -What did he say? -Toilet. -Miss, one Vanilla Pink. [server] Yes, sir. Get me a lava cupcake, please. Manuel, favor. Next time, no more gifts, okay? Why? What's wrong with that? It's not bad to give gifts if there's a reason to. Your son already likes you without gifts. That hurts a bit. You think I'm using gifts… -so the kid will love me? -That's not the point. I'm just saying you don't spoil a child. I just gave him gifts. You call that spoiled? [in English] That's not how Jason and I raised him, okay? Thank you. Speaking of Jason… he's inviting you and your roommate- slash-best friend over for dinner. Wait. Why do I have to take Ronnie? Manu, can we be honest here? I already know, okay? [clears throat] Know what? I know about you and your best friend-slash-roommate. So what? You even want to deny that you and your roommate are just "best friends." Why do you have to meddle in my private life? Okay, fine. You're right. That's your private life. You're old enough. You know what you're doing. I'm just saying that… even before, when we were hanging out, I already knew. [in English] How? Duh? You crazy girl! You knew, but why did you stick with me? What did you want? Beauty tips? No, I actually like hanging out with you, being with you, and I enjoyed spending time with you, and even though I know you're like that, you're still a man. [playful music] Excuse me. For the record, Monique, I remember what happened. You got me drunk. -You made me drink half a bottle of Vodka. -Ah… You abused me. You used my body! You took advantage of my womanhood! And then what? -What? -What? -I said what? -What? -Are you guys fighting? -[both] No! [playful music continues] Monique, tell me the truth. Did you tell the kid? About? About me. What about you? Wow! Don't play innocent, please. Okay. What are you talking about? -You know… -That you like boys? Is that it? More or less. Manuel, I'm not so stupid as to do that to you. I don't know. Maybe you're judgmental. I'm not judgmental. It's you who's in denial. Anyway, the kid is smart. -He can think whatever he wants to think. -[sighs] If he asks, I'll let him know. If not, then… Wait. Before you finish your declaration, Ah… can I ask for a favor? What? If he asks you a question, can you tell him I'll be the one to answer? Okay. -Daddy! -No, son! There's no question yet. [Monique speaking in French] [speaking in French] [Monique speaking in French] Mh? Tick… Okay. That's just a book. [speaks in French] [mocking]Tikuya tikuya. -[speaks French] -What's that kuy? Tikoy? -Balls. -Ah. [friend] Manu has a son? Yes. Seven years old. -[laughs] -Seriously? Wait, what did you say to the kid? How did Manu introduce you to his son? Housemate. You'll make the child believe that you're only housemates? Maybe, when he's old enough to understand. And when is that? [Manu] I'm really happy. It's a different feeling, you know? -Do you get me, guys? -No. [laughs sarcastically] I have a son! How about you? Don't you have plans for children? How? Well, you can adopt. I don't want to adopt. It's different. [in English] I feel… complete. Aww. Don't you want that? The feeling of completion. Well, I have Elizabeth. Stupid! Elizabeth is a Shih Tzu. What… [Monique] Your papa wants us to be together. We'll go to Singapore together. We can go to Universal Studios. But Mama, I have already been to Universal Studios. Yes, but this one is in Singapore. [Tristan speaks in French] You want us to leave you here? We can't do that. We can't leave you alone. [excitedly] I won't be alone. I will be with Daddy. [Jason] You see? You see what I mean? Wait! Why are you making it sound like it's my fault? Look. I can't force the kid to go if he does not want to go. The only reason he wants to stay is to be with Manuel. You know why, don't you? Because the man spoils him. [Aunt Baby] The child uses his mother's surname. Right? Why did you allow it? What can I do, Auntie? It's Monique who raised the kid. [Karen] Well, legally speaking, you cannot claim that Tristan is your son because he has been legally adopted by Monique's husband. Adopted? What's that? The child has his own father. [Edward] Auntie, Manu is not the father according to his birth certificate. -The stepfather can adopt him. -Yes. [Aunt Baby] Did you hear, Manuel? I'm telling you. Do not allow this! [Karen] It's not easy, Auntie. Manu doesn't have the legal claim to the child. [Bessy] Manu is in a meeting for an event, and we are so busy right now. So, how are you, young man? -I'm really good. -Good. -Hey! -Hi, Daddy! [Monique] Bye! So, when are you going home? On Tuesday evening. Tuesday? -Wow! Five whole days together! Yes! -Wow! Yes! Manu, remember okay? Fine. Besides, I don't have memory loss, okay? No more gifts, Manu. -[in Filipino] Say bye to your Mom. -Bye Mama! -Bye bye! -Have a nice trip! -Thank you! -Come on! Manu… [Tristan sighs] Daddy? Daddy? -Yes, son? What's the problem? -Look! [screams] It's Uncle Ronnie's underwear. Eh… No, son. This is mine. Look! Right? Of course not. Look! It has Uncle Ronnie's initials on it. R.E. Just give it to me. Ahm… Why is Uncle Ronnie's underwear here? Nanny. Nanny. [shrieking] Nanny! [in English] Yes, Manu! You called? Nanny, look at this. Ronnie's underwear is in my room. Huh? [stuttering] Take this away to the laundry, hurry! Take it! Take it! -[sniffs disgustedly] -Go! [music playing on TV] [laughing] [giggling] -Thank you! -Ice cream. [laughs] -Yummy! -What's happening? We are just dancing! -Really? -I will also dance! Yeah! [laughs] Is that mine? Whoa! [bicycle bell rings] [gentle music plays] Yes! Oh no! Oh, no! [door closes] [gentle music continues] [giggles] Mmm! Like a real mom! A-ha! [Tristan] You baked that? [in Filipino] Of course, my son. -[in Filipino] Is it good? -Tastes so good! Mom's cooking is bland. Can you not bring me back to Mama? I like it here. [laughs] [Monique] So, did you go to the mall? Hmm? [Tristan] Yes. Did you ask your Dad to buy something again? No. [clears throat] No toys? No books? You already told Daddy that I have a lot of toys and books. Well, did you have fun? Have you missed me and your papa? Hmm? [speaking in French] [speaking in French] He will not be seven years old forever. One day, you will see him as a grown man dating girls. Why are you annoying me, Ronnie? What is the theme of your talk TV? Well, there are things that he must know, and you should tell him those. Then what do you want me to do? The next time he visits I should say to him… "Son, I need to tell you something, you do not have just two fathers, you also have two mommies!" Is that it? Now that you are in this situation, what is my role in your lives? Wow, where is that line from? "Your role in our lives." So between us, who's being over-dramatic? Would you rather let your child know the truth from other people? [scoffs] Nonsense, goodnight. Enough drama for tonight. [snoring] Come on! So he would be really surprised. He's right! It's been five years since Sammy went back home. Well, that welcome party was too much for Samuel. Who is he? Melania Trump? Manuel, you know that Samuel is not feeling very well. He's right. Sammy has cancer. He's been posting that on social media! But that queer is still alive. And also, of all things, testicular cancer? That queer has cancer right in his testicles? You're so into being a role model father. -Indeed! -Yes! Just admit it's because Manuel is just insecure. Insecure towards young, fresh, and slim gays. Hey, come on, that hurts. I went to the gym already. That's because it's hard to accept the truth… that there are more good-looking gays now! Challenge accepted! [cheers] -Party! -[screams] What do you think of me? Granny Goose? [Manu] Let out those fresh queers you're talking about. [upbeat music] That's it! -Is this okay? -Give it your best shot, friends. Here are the clothes! [shouts of excitement] Let the seductive operation begin! [cheers] -Guys, get your clothes! Here! -Yes! Thank you so much! Perfect! This is what I'm going to wear tonight. Wow! There's already a winner, let's go home. Come on, Mother. We're going to look ugly when we're beside you. You planned this. [chuckles] That's the whole point, because tonight I am a Bratz Doll. [exclaims] Bratz Doll? You mean voodoo doll! -[laughter] -What if I give you a sample? You're so violent. [Manu] Come on! Go! Well, well! Papa Ronnie! What did you eat, guys? Ha? Hi! [screams] Me first. Selfish! What have you eaten? Why are you glamming up? Don't worry! This happens rarely. -We're doing this for Sammy. -Yes! Come on! You don't like Sammy. Of course not! I like Sammy… but not that much. But still. [laughter] It's good that your son is not here. -Bye, Papa Ronnie! -Won't you be joining? He's busy! How sensitive! He's not sharing! [chatters inaudibly] What's your lipstick? Looks good. Um… Tristan, I have an emergency with a client. Is it okay if I drop you off at Daddy's since we're already here in Antipolo? Daddy's house? Sure, I'll be more than glad to see Daddy. What kind of eye shadow do you have, Ricky. You look like someone beat you! -Look! I looked like a faggot here. -[phone vibrating] You don't look like a faggot, you look like a horror creature. -So mean. -[phone vibrating] Do you think Sammy will be surprised… when he sees us like this? -I don't think so. - [phone vibrating] Look at him! [shouts] See? Right? Sammy will be surprised when he sees this! You're like a pink troll! [laughter] [Monique] He's not picking up. Maybe he's busy. [phone dialing] What we are going to do? You can drop me off with Daddy. [in Filipino] For sure, your nanny is there. Are you sure? Mama, stop treating me like a baby. Okay. Okay. You're not a baby anymore. To Manu's house, please. [eventful music playing] [cheering] [cheering] Tristan, sure you'll be okay? -I'll be back… -Yeah. I'll be back 10 p.m. after dinner. Okay? -Okay. Bye, Mama! -Say hi to your dad for me. -Tristan? -Where's Daddy? Go! Just say hi to your dad! I'll be back at 10 p.m., okay? I just have to do something. I'll call you when I'm on the way. [bouncy music playing] -Hi, Uncle Ronnie! -Hey, Tristan. -Where's Daddy? -Downstairs. [laughter] Tristan! Wait! Wait! [screaming] -Tristan! -Daddy? We're busted. [Manu] How could you do this to me? We didn't schedule that visit! Manu, it was just an emergency. Okay? But you could have at least called! Ah-- Excuse me? I called your phone. No answer. Check those missed calls. It's so embarrassing! -I want to die. I want to die. -You're not going to die, drama queen. How is the child? I think he got traumatized after what he saw. Relax. He's fine. Okay? [sighs] Are you sure? Tristan, Daddy wants to know if you're okay. [speaking in French] Hmm? You hear that? What did he say? [Shelly] Manuel, will you please get real? Of course, she is his mother. So what? Remember that she was the one who raised the child. That is what's getting on my nerves already. Because I am thinking of my son's well-being. Even watching TV is limited. [cheering] Even eating ice cream -is not allowed! -Wow! Enjoy! Thank you! Nice! Hey Manuel! Hasn't she told you that he should not eat ice cream at night? It's just a little bit. Didn't you do it as a kid? What is she, a terrorist? Delicious? Even Ronnie and I are getting into arguments. Even the computer, she interferes. Tristan, what are these websites you're going to? -I was just reading. -Even so! -These websites are not for kids like you. -[Shelly] What is wrong with that? Ronnie is correct! You're intentionally doing that. You're contradicting his mother so the child will be closer to you, to hide the truth about who you are. Of course not! Oh dear, can you just get real? The problem with you is you're so in denial. Even the dead corpse in the morgue knows you too well! [suspenseful music playing] Have you talked to the dead body? [mocks] Go on Regor, lie to me. Drown me with all your pretentious words. You're going crazy, Valentina Yes! I am going crazy because I know the truth. What truth are you talking about? The truth about who you really are. What you are, what your heart longs for. -I can't understand you. -[Monique] Tristan? [Valentina] Yes! I already know. I know everything. You and your driver Bruno are having an affair! You fool! You're a worthless wife! You animal! [groans] Tristan? Don't fight because of me! Damn you! Do you think you're the helpless one here? Bruno, are you hurt? Tristan, what are you watching? [in English] Shh! I'm watching TV. Yaya? Do you need anything, ma'am? Yaya! [gasps] Yes, ma'am? [grunts] Bruno! What is he watching? I watch this everyday at Daddy's house! This is his favorite show. Ma'am, that's a famous afternoon soap opera. My Driver, Your Lover! What!? Ma'am? "Driver ko, Lover mo!" My son is watching this crap? So that I can practice my Tagalog. [theme song continues to play] [shouts] Manu! [chuckles] -You're wearing your pajamas again. -Manuel, you know for a fact we don't want Tristan to be distracted from his studies due to too much TV. -Two hours? Is that too much? -Two hours then you make him watch… soap operas like My Driver, Your Lover. What the F is that? Those soap operas, telenovelas, those are part of the Filipino culture. So you're telling me you make him watch soap operas for cultural reasons? Is that it? I mean, what kind of reasoning is that? So, I deserve an explanation? I need an acceptable reason? Is that what you wanted to ask? The soap opera's about gays! So what!? Tristan is seven! Are you even thinking? You are the one who told me to start them young. We had an agreement that you would follow the rules to have no TV, no ice cream, no everything! And if you can't abide by those rules, then forget it! Wait, are you threatening me? I'm telling you this because I'm his mother! [Aunt Baby] What did your brother say? [Karen] Can he do something? I knew it. That woman, I knew from then that she was a she-devil! Come on, Auntie. -You haven't met Monique yet. -I don't need to, I have the ability. [laughs] I already knew she was a she-devil even before I met her. Auntie, I think it's Manuel's fault. Monique's allegations are true, and besides he's spoiling his son. Of course! He's the father. They just met and it's natural for him to spoil his son. -Just like me to you guys. -And that's not all. The kid might have indigestion. He's been eating ice cream for quite some time. Let him be. He likes it. It's natural, he's a kid. He won't get enough of it. [Karen] Do you know Ronnie is mad? Manuel told me that. Ronnie? What does he have to do? What is the true relationship of Ronnie and Manuel? Eh… Nothing, Auntie. -He's just giving his opinion. -So, is anyone asking for it? Should I have them arrested? Manu, calm down. How will I calm down? They don't let me talk to the kid! It's your fault! [Manu] Why does it seem you're on their side? When we were kids, your elbows and knees were full of ringworm… and I was the only person who came and talked to you! Then you will do this to me? All I can say is Manuel and the woman should talk. They should stop outshining each other. The child suffers. Manuel is trying, but Monique had enough. Ma'am! Phone call! Who is it? It's Sir Manuel. Tell him I'm not here! [playful music] Hello, sir? Ma'am told me she's not here. [Manu] She disrespected me! [breathing intensely] I hope you know that you're overreacting. Overreacting? How can I not overreact? They're suppressing my right to see and talk to my child! They don't want me to see my son! [cries] Stop it! enough! No! No! I don't want to stop! I want to be mad! [crying] That's what I was saying, I warned you. You told me that everything's fine. So now? [sobbing] What will I do? I've come to love the kid. -[crying] -[sad emotional music playing] [Monique] How long will you be gone? [Jason] I think that's a total of… Tristan? Take your earphones out. Put that away, please. Tristan? Did you hear your papa? Put that away, please. For a while. You know you can't play with your iPad while we eat. -Why? -Because I said so, that's why. Tristan, stop it. How come in Daddy's house I can play my iPad even though I'm at the dining table? That's your daddy's home, okay? Now you're at your papa's. -Dad said… -Stop it, Tristan! Just put the tablet away now! But mom, it's okay with Daddy. He may be your daddy, okay? But I'm your papa. Listen to me because I'm your father. Do you understand? I was the one who raised you! I'm a father to you more than anyone else. You get me? [cries silently] Tristan, sit! Finish your dinner! Jason , let him be. [soft dramatic music playing] [cries] [sniffles] Trist… You awake? Hmm? [speaking in French] You just have to be a good boy. Yes, mama. If you're hungry, tell your nanny. Okay? [door closes] [playful music] Give him cereal if he wakes up. I won't have lunch here, but I'll be back at 2 p.m. -Can you please clean the service area? -I got you, ma'am. -Bye, Jasmine. Thank you. -Bye! Take care! [suspenseful music playing] [bouncy music plays] [singing] [driver] Good morning, sir. What's your name? Tristan. Are you alone? Yes! Stop asking questions. I'm in a hurry! Go, go, go! -What time will the flowers arrive? -They said 4 p.m. Manu, your phone. Four o'clock? Those will wither before we even start! Are you deaf? Your phone keeps on ringing! I know! How about the catering? Is it ready? -I will follow up. -[phone ringing] Hello, Nanny. What's the problem? You have to go back home, right now! Why? -Your son is here! -Who? Eh… Ah… It's Tristan. Who else would it be? Do you have any other child? Tristan! Did you come here alone? -How? -Gruber! Oh my God! You took Gruber? How did you know the address? Daddy… hello? I can read, remember? [clicks tongue] Son, don't do that again! I just wanted to see you. But, they don't like. Huh… Who said no? Papa said he's my father, not you… so I should follow him. He said that? [thinking] I want to scream! [screams] [clears throat] Don't worry, son. Daddy is here. Okay? Jasmine… Yes, ma'am? What time did my son eat? Ma'am, he didn't come down yet. It's already 2:30 p.m. He did not eat breakfast or lunch? Why didn't you wake him up? You're assuming, ma'am. I woke him up and knocked on his door, but he's not answering. -Tristan? -[ominous music playing] Tristan? Tristan? Tristan? Tristan! -[Jasmine] Tristan? -[Monique panting] Where is Tristan? I don't know, ma'am. Seriously? [sobbing] Seriously, ma'am. Tristan! Are you sure he didn't go out? Ma'am, I'm sure! Actually, I'm not so sure… because I was in the service area. I took care of what you asked for. [heavy breathing] Okay. Check the backyard, check the club house. -Okay? -Okay. Okay, ma'am. [Jason] Monique, okay? Calm down, Calm down, sweetheart. I can't find him, I don't know what time he left. I don't know if he left with anyone. I don't how he disappeared. He's not here. He's not in the house. -Did you talk to the village security? -They did not see anything! I don't know, I just got home! Honey, let me get right back to you. Find out, and let me get back to you. [clears throat] My apologies, gentlemen. -Jasmine! -But ma'am… Ma'am, ma'am, according to Mr. Security Guard, a red car came to our house. It's Gruber. Who was in the car? No one, but he came to fetch Tristan. Tristan knows how to use Gruber? Where did he go? [phone rings] Hello, Jason. You are not going to believe this. I don't know where I failed… I gave my whole life to you! Forgive me, It's my fault. I'm the one to blame. No! It's me! I'm the one at fault. You're really interested there, huh? Are you really watching that? Do you like that? [soap opera continues] You're really my child! It's you. No. It's me who's fake. -No! It's me! -No! It's me! Enough! Daddy, your phone. [phone ringing] [phone continues ringing] Never mind her. Maybe I should leave. Manush! Manush! Tristan's mom is here! What? Where? Mama's here? Son, stay there and don't go out. She's outside and she wants to get in, but I told her that I'll tell you first. Good answer! [Nanny] Of course! Where's my son? Give me back my son. You came rushing here after how many days you've been hiding from me! And now you just suddenly appear with a cape? Cut the crap! Give me back Tristan! I'm sorry, but he doesn't like you! It's because you're raising him wrong. You're a mother, but you don't know how to be a mommy! How dare you! You've just been a parent for months, and now you think you're a great mother? I raised Tristan alone until Jason came. Don't ever question my parenting! Hey! I'm not happy with what you're doing! Give me back my son! What are you waiting for? SOCO? Call the security! What? Give me-- [footsteps in the background] So you wanna play dirty? Okay! Fine! I'll be back! I'll be back together with the police. [grunts] Roy, let's go and find the nearest police station. Yes, ma'am! Manush! Manush! Oh my, Manush! [panting] The woman said she's going to call the police! Why didn't you let her face… Nanny, get the car key. Change your clothes. We're leaving. Let's go! [Tristan] Daddy where are we going? [Manu] We're going on an adventure! [Tristan] Awesome! [cheerful music playing] [phone ringing] Sorry! Excuse me. Hello, Nanny? Yes. How did they leave? The mother came rushing here! Wait…wait! How did the kid get there? He just suddenly showed up here. I don't know how he got here. And Manu didn't want to return the child to his-- [police siren] Oh my God! God, God! There's police outside! Police? What are the police doing there? I'm begging you, Ronnie. Come back home! I don't know what I'm going to do with the police outside. -What should I do? -You should calm down. I'll be there. I'll come back home. Okay! Why are there police? It's Tristan and Manu! Open the door! I have a search warrant! Open, please. Open! [Nanny groans] I'm with the DSWD! Where is Tristan? Tristan! [Nanny stutters] Where's Tristan? [stuttering] If you don't tell me the truth, you are an accessory to a crime. [gasps] How is the child related to his kidnapper? He is the father. Huh? The father kidnapped his son. -We're not together anymore. -And custody? His father is different from his biological father. Can you just look for my child? [cheerful music playing] [phone ringing] They are not picking up. This is unbelievable! No one's picking up. Hi, sir! Maybe I could help with this misunderstanding! And who's this? Well, I'm the owner of this house. I thought the father took him? I'm with Manu, the father of the child. Oh… You're related? No, we're partners. Business partners? No, just partners! You must be Monique? -Yes. -I'm Ronnie. Nice to meet you! Likewise. [in English] Now, can we look for my son? -Bro, full tank. -Full tank, sir? Sir, can you open the gas tank? -Sir, full tank starts at zero. -Yes. What is Manu even thinking? Why did he take away the kid? John, you don't know Manu like me. Well, I guess. Just keep calling him. I called him a while ago, he's not answering. I also tried calling, no one's answering. I tried calling Tristan, there's nothing! Oh my gosh! -[phone ringing] -It's ringing. [phone ringing] -Ronnie… Someone's calling Manu! -[phone ringing] [phone ringing] Oh, I remember. Manu forgot his phone. I don't have my wallet, I don't have my license. I don't have money. Where's my phone? -Wait! Stop it! -No, daddy! No worry. Here, two thousand. Thanks son! Uh, go! Full tank! You still have enough for the toll? Got it covered! [laughing] Thanks! For snacks? -Just pick up. -Monique? I'm truly sorry about this. No worries. It's not your fault. The… the tracking thingy… the… What it's called? [exciting music playing] Oh my God! Guys, guys! I know where he is. [indistinct] Okay, he's heading south. His phone! He turned off his phone. Please, please, please… -Come on! Let's go! -Let's go! Wow, Daddy! Nice view! This is where your Uncle Ronnie and I met. He was with his family, and I was with my friends. He approached me, and the rest is history. I think you were destined for each other. [clears throat] You know about us? I do! And I understand. [soft music] I'm sorry, son. For what? Eh… I know that what I'm doing… is wrong. And your mom is probably worried. Don't worry, Daddy. It's gonna be okay. [Jason] Maybe it's not a good idea that Tristan knows his biological father. Not just for the child, but for Manuel too. [Monique] Your son wanted to meet his father. Still no lead. I know, but are we also being fair to Manuel? Excuse me. Sorry to eavesdrop. I just want to tell you guys something. I've never seen Manuel this happy. Especially when he's with his son. And, he's willing to give up everything for Tristan. I hope you understand that he doesn't have bad intentions with what he did today. [Manu] Tristan, the hot dog is already cooked. Okay, Dad. [phone chimes] -It's Tristan. -Wait, what? -Nature's Park.. Nature.. -Nature's Park! Look, son… I'm not trying to replace your mommy. I don't know how to be a daddy, much less a mommy. You don't have to be a mother to be a mom. You just have to love like one. -[soft music] -[fire crackling in the background] I love you, son. I love you too, Daddy. [Tristan] Daddy, do you know what those stars are called? [Manu] I don't know anything about that. I only know my favorite, Diamond Star. [police siren blaring] Manu Castillo? Present! Arrest him! No! He didn't do anything! Arrest him. -He didn't do anything! No! -Tristan! No! No! He didn't do anything! No! -Don't restrain him. -He will go voluntarily. Take that away. No! Daddy! Daddy! No! Daddy! Daddy! -You know what you did… -Daddy! Daddy! -…is kidnapping. [poignant music playing] It's okay, son. [crying] Daddy! Daddy! [cries] Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! [sobbing] [Jason] Let's go! Come on, Tristan. -Daddy! No, Daddy! [continues crying] Sorry… It's okay. [sobbing] [Aunt Baby] Have you called them?- [Manu] Not yet. Here is the design you were looking for. [Aunt Baby] I knew it. You're embarrassed of the mess you made, right? More or less. But much more than less. You know, dear… in life, there are things that we can fix. And there are things that we should accept. Right? It's like flowing water. We shall follow where the flow brings us. Do you understand? -That was so deep, Auntie. -Oh my. Eh… [clears throat] Well, since we're being so melodramatic. Can I go all the way? Oh dear, wait! Does Tristan have a sibling? -That's not it, Auntie. -Thank goodness. Ah, I just want to let you know, it is true what our relatives have been saying about me. That Ronnie… my housemate… he's my husband. [grunts] No. Yes. -No. -Yes. -No. -Yes. -[sobbing] No. -Yes. -[crying] -Yes. [sobbing] No! Yes, Auntie! [sobbing] Lord, no! Yes, Auntie. Yes! -Lord! -Auntie! Auntie! -Auntie! -Water! Water! Quick! Auntie, are you okay? What? Do you want me to call Dr. Paciano? I'm okay! I'm fine! -Give me that water! -Yes, Auntie. Thank you so much. -Auntie, are you sure you're okay? -I'm okay! You can do it. Finish your food. Let's go, baby. [Karen] Finish your food, come. [fanning rapidly] Auntie. I'm really sorry. -I'm really, really sorry, -Wait, let me speak first. Don't you think this is just your "growing up" stage? Huh? Come on! My vaccines are all complete! I'm over 30 years old and I'm in my "growing up" stage? Maybe you can try. I've always known you're like that. -What do you mean? -You being gay! I've always had this hunch. I was just in denial. But when I found out about Tristan, I said to myself, "I told you he's not gay!" Is he a good person? Auntie, do you think he could stay with me that long if he isn't a good person? You have a point. -Right? -Yes! [gentle music playing] [exhales] Are you happy? Yes! That's all I want to hear. That's all I want to know. Because I want you to be happy. Auntie, can I ask a favor? What is it? Can you give me a hug? [cries] Of all people, you're the one I don't want to hurt. [gentle music continues] Remember this. I want you to always be happy. If you're not happy anymore, get out of that situation. Find a place where you can be happy. I don't want an ugly cry. I want to always be beautiful. -There. Perfect point. -.Yeah. [cries] [Monique] Hey! [in French] Are you okay? Hmm? [in French] Yes, Mom. [in English] Do you want to go out and watch a movie? What do you wanna do? I'm fine, Mama. [Jason]Of course he's gonna miss him. You opened the door for Tristan to love the man. [Monique] Was I wrong to do that? No. No. But you're wrong with the way you behave. Why? Well… In the short time they were together, Manu has loved his son. And believe this, Monique. Tristan loves his real father. [breathes deeply] -What am I gonna do? -I don't know. [sniffles] But there's one thing you can't do. What's that? You can't make Tristan unlove his father. [poignant music playing] [phone ringing] Monique? [clears throat] Monique… [in English] before anything else… I'd like to say that I'm sorry. Me too. Really? I want you to know that… I understand. I mean, the reason I agreed to let you get to know Tristan… is because I want him to grow up knowing who he is, and… that you are his father. He can't find it out from someone else. I mean, Jason and I have always been honest with him. And I don't mind you loving him. Because you are his daddy. [soft music] -I'm sorry if… -[in English] Look. I understand. I want you to make the most of the time we're here in Manila, so… But of course, if you come to the States to visit… no problem with that. [in Filipino] But you know what I am. Yes. But you are still and will always be his father. Being what you are doesn't mean you can't be a good father to our son. [soft music] [birds chirping] Jason and I have already talked about it, [in English] and we think it's unfair… to keep Tristan away from you. We're leaving for Saigon next Thursday. Is it okay… that… we leave Tristan with you first? Daddy! [cheerful music playing] I missed you so much! -I missed you, too. -[chuckles] [Karen] I will call him. -[nanny] Manush! -[Karen] Bro! -Hi! Hello! -Hi! Hello! Sorry we're late, we had a long trip. Okay, go inside and eat. I just cooked. I'm here! -Hi! -Your house is so beautiful! Are you the one who designed it? Of course! Oh my! It's so beautiful! But it's so far. It is. How was your trip? Hello, Lala Baby! Lala, this is Uncle Ronnie, Daddy's boyfriend. At last, I finally meet you in person! Ooh! -How are you? -I'm good. Uh, shall we eat? Yes, let's go eat. -That's right, I just cooked. -Really? -Mmm! -Mmmh! You have nice taste! Of course! You're so gay! Confirmed! -Let's go. Let's eat! -Come on, let's eat! [indistinct chattering] Go ahead! Get some food. Go ahead. [laughter] Take three! Cut! [laughter] Joke! [chuckles] -Take three! -My phone's on silent mode. It's because… -[laughter] -Sorry! Let's go! [grunts] [laughter] [director] He surrendered! Ouch! That hurts! [laughter] [chokes] How do you know my name? [stutters] You must be my daddy's housemate. [stutters] I'd like you to meet… [laughter] I'd like you to meet Uncle Ronnie! Uncle, Uncle, Uncle, Uncle. [speaking in Filipino] I didn't! Oh okay. -[laughter] -[speaking in Filipino] -[laughter] -[speaking in Filipino] That's it? What's the moral of the story? What moral… [laughter] Moral of the story! -Do you want us to call Dr. Paciano? -I'm good now! She's okay now. [laughter] Come. Eat! Someone's playing the piano. -Is there really someone playing piano? -Someone's doing a recital. -[chuckles] -The mother? Mother's doing her recital. Mother, we had to cut the take. Move your right hand inside. Move my… Oh, that was odd. [laughter] Manu! -Cut! Very good! -[laughter] So don't you ever… [curses] [laughs] Don't you ever-- [laughs] [chortles] -This is not funny! Open this gate! -[gate clunking] [laughter] He's… He's gay. -[laughter] -[director] Action! Good, huh? [laughter] Action! [laughter] [speaking in Filipino] Let me put it out first. [people chatter indistinctly] [laughter] Are you good, Sos? I think so. [giggling] -[Monique] I'm sorry! -[people chatter] [in English] Sorry. [indistinct chatter] [Tristan] What is it? I don't get it. We're now uncle and auntie. Emily has a cousin and Manuel has a child. What? A child? A human being? No. A dragonfly. A dragonfly… [laughter] No. [giggling] No. A child monster. [laughs] No. Whiteheads. She gave birth to white… [laughs hysterically] [laughing] I'd like to say… there's a videoke. -Monique… -Daddy! -[director] Not yet! -[Tristan] Oh, not yet? Pick up! -[speaking in Filipino] -[laughter] Who's your mommy? -I'm his mommy! -I'm his mommy! -You? -Yes! But you're gay? Gay? Like queer? Vevak! [laughter]
