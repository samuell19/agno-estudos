[MUSIC - MIRE EKLUND, "YOU HAPPEN TWICE"] (SINGING) I heard them in the other room, several features and several morns. There's no holding back in the land of the frozen tracks. [SPEAKING SWEDISH] (SINGING) And I would like to see behind you. And when you knock the door in, through thoughts real long and fast. We stop and stay and close-- not there, they'll know it. [SPEAKING SWEDISH] (SINGING) Silence that don't go to waste-- enough for, enough for, enough for, enough for us both now. It's not the-- it's not the game, I swear. You come close up.

Do you want to get closer? [MUSIC - ROXETTE, "IT MUST HAVE BEEN LOVE"] (SINGING) It must have been love but it's over now. Lay a whisper on my pillow. Leave the winter on the ground. I wake up lonely. There's air of silence in the bedroom and all around. Touch me now. I close my eyes and dream away. It must have been love, but it's over now. It must have been good, but I lost it somehow. It must have been love, but it's over now-- from the moment we touched till the time had run out.

There's no holding back in the land of the frozen tracks. And I would like to see behind you. And when you knock a door in, the hours stop then stayed. I saw you stand and flow, and I see we're holding hands. You had been twice in times below. They come for someone. It's not the-- it's not the same. I want silence that don't go to waste-- enough for, enough for, enough for, enough for us both now. It's not the-- it's not the game, I swear. You come close up. Hello, let's go. And I know something peculiar. This room and place will change. Through thoughts real long and fast, we stop and stay and close-- not there, they'll know it. See we're holding hands. You had been twice in times below. They come for someone. It's not the-- it's not the game, I swear. You come close up, my friend, my friend. Different places, different eyes.
