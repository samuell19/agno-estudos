Melinda? This is your last chance! Do not fuck with me! Melinda! Many times we limit ourselves when we think about what we deserve. We forget what we want. Our imagination has been traumatized and relies beyond what others have laid out for us.

I'm sorry, but it's against the rules to smoke near a pump. Well what do you want me to do? I just lit this. I know, and I have nothing against smoking. I smoke too. It's okay to have one over there by my van if you want me to show you. Nah, I'm almost done here. It's just really dangerous to smoke by the pump. The whole gas station can light on fire. I'm not a fucking idiot, all right? What do you think, I'd take this and stick it in a pump? I wasn't trying to be mean to you. You don't need to yell at me. Hey. Hey. Diane left again without cleaning the bathrooms or restocking. That's okay, I'll do it. The pistachios are really amazing. Oh, my bad. They're my favorite nut in the store. Cool. If you don't like them, I'll give you a refund. Okay. My name is Melinda, by the way. Thanks. Whoa, Jesus. Is this the ladies room? No, you're in the right place. This is the men's. I was just cleaning the bathroom. Oh you can go ahead and use it. You know, you really ought to put a sign if you're gonna be in here. Is the coffee ready? Yes, here you go. How do these skanks do this? Left, right, left, right, oh yeah, left - Do what? - Right Here, watch my ass. Do you see it? I think so. Okay now try flexing your ass cheek one at a time. What? Just try it. Okay, go left, yeah, right, left, right, left, right, yes, left, right, keep going. I think you're doing it right. Yeah, left, right, left, left... - Wait you were filming? - Left, keep going. Keep going. Sheila. People need to see this. What do you mean, people? Wait, people coming into the store? What, no. Sheila, can you please delete that? What are you doing? What do you care, no one knows who you are. Please can you delete it? Oh god. You take this one, okay? Oh, what are you doing, freak? I don't want anyone to see that. All right, I'll delete it. Hi there. Hi. Uh, hey there. How can I help you? Um, what's her name? Sheila. Sheila, right. Hi Sheila. Uh, I was in here a few nights ago. Do you remember? It's Fred. No, I see a lot of faces in here. Hi Fred, my name is Melinda. Um, we were talking and you were telling me how your feet hurt so much from standing all night and so um, uh, I thought these might help. They're padded insoles for your shoes. I'm guessing you're uh, size nine? Here, you should uh, try em out. Wow, these look really comfortable. She's right, after a long shift, we all have aching feet. I'm not a size nine. Oh well that's okay because you can cut these down if they're too big. Okay, okay, stop, stop, stop, okay? - You could get planters... - Just stop, stop. I don't want your foot pads, okay? I don't want anything from you. Well they're um... Sheila, I think he's just being nice. I don't care how nice he thinks he's being. He comes in here every night. We're not gonna have some sort of thing happening between us, okay? You understand? Excuse me, is there another register open? Um, Fred, your insoles. I swear to god, he's pathetic. Can I get two of the Lucky 7 scratchers and two of the Platinum Payout? The insoles fit my shoes perfectly. What? It's like Cinderella. The shoe fits. Your insoles fit my shoes. Hi there. Let me know if you need help with anything. My name is Melinda, I work here. Hi Melinda. Um, that's very kind of you. Is everyone else that works here as nice as you are? Not really. Sheila over there can be quite mean, but that's because everyone talks to her. I understand. She's very pretty. Okay, um, maybe you can help me out by telling me where the cigarettes are? Oh that's easy, the cigarettes are always by the counter. Great. Don't you wish people picked up after themselves? I guess that means you wouldn't have a job then. How are you, Melinda? Everything good tonight? Yeah, everything's good. Is that your new car? Yes it is. It's my first night going solo. Does that make you nervous? No, I've been training for this for a long time. Feels great being by myself. Looks powerful. Do you need help? No. Zero to 60 in 5.3 seconds. Wow. The back of it kind of looks like a robot with sunglasses. No I'm uh, just looking for condoms. Really? You've been looking for like five minutes, do you need me to assist you with that? Can't imagine how you could. Are the windows bullet proof? Like, if bad guys were shooting at you, would the bullets just bounce off? No, they'd hit me. I can take my break right now. Can you take me for a ride? Here, these should work. Yeah. I'll ring you up at the counter. It's amazing, it's like an office. Yeah, it is. This is one of the newer models. What about the parking lot, can we just go around the parking lot? I wish I could, but I really need to stay on schedule. Maybe I could get arrested and then you could take me on a ride and do your job. What if I took this? - No! I'm sorry. I'll take you on a ride later. I promise. I'm gonna go get a coffee, stay on schedule. Okay. Hi Sheila. Hi Officer Lou. That's $9.45. Hey you know what, uh, keep the change. You sure? I believe in karma. So is there a bathroom I could use? Yeah, right around the corner. All right. How's everything tonight? Ready to go home, but I can't because Perry's being an asshole right now. He just does not care that he's late everywhere he goes. I'm sorry to hear that. This cracks me up. Fast action, extra stimulating sex enhancements, 100% guaranteed. It's always about sex with you boys, isn't it? Oh I, no, I don't, no, it's not me. Oh, I see, you've never had that problem. No, no. Melinda, what the hell are you doing? Were you just taking pictures of us? I wasn't. Officer Lou is a police officer... I wasn't. That's so inappropriate. Sheila, Sheila, it's okay, relax. Is your phone all right, Melinda? Melinda, show us your phone. Oh, that's not good. I broke my screen as well. Attention all units, we have a 503 in progress. Suspect, white male, he may be armed, last seen in a gray sedan driving south on 93. That's me. Sorry about your phone, Melinda. I gotta run. You are so creepy. Who else do you take pictures of when they're not looking? Do you take pictures of me? Give me your phone, Melinda or I'll report you and you'll lose your job. Show me your phone. I wasn't taking pictures of you. Oh, just Officer Lou? That's fucking creepy, he probably thinks you're so weird. I would. Oh. Oh my god, you have an entire album for him? What do you do? Do you go home and rub yourself looking at pictures of him? Officer Lou? Don't tell me you're some kind of weird virgin. Stop it, Sheila. Oh my god, are you holding out or something cause I'm sure one of these truckers out here will bang you in the bathroom if you ask them to. I can probably set something up for you. You sick bitch. Uh, did you just hit me? Hi Melinda. Don't be afraid, okay? I was just in the middle of explaining to your friend, Sheila here that I am not here to hurt anybody. That's not why I'm here, but I do need your cooperation. Can you follow some simple instructions? Yes, great. Would you mind going over there and standing next to your friend, Sheila? She's not my friend. Okay, regardless, get over there. Where the hell were you? I'm not even supposed to be here. Hey! Okay, now listen, no one is going to be getting hurt, all right? I am not some evil criminal. Do I look like some evil criminal, Melinda? No, great. I am just in a little bit of trouble and I know that it's not your guy's fault, however, I will be needing your cooperation. When this is all said and done, you are going to have one hell of a story to tell. There are some very unreasonable people who are trying to kill me and it wasn't even my fucking fault. I did lose my temper, but anyways, I'm sure that you ladies wouldn't want a face like this going to waste on a dead man. Right, Melinda? Can you hurry up? You're robbing us, right? That's what's happening? You need to calm the fuck down. Okay, now, neither of you two ladies own this gas station, correct? No. No. That's great news. That's great news, cause you know why, this is not personal. Okay, I'm not robbing you guys, it's not your money. Everything inside both the registers and everything in the safe. Well, we don't have the keys to the safe. Only the managers do. Fuck. Okay, then just give me everything in the registers. It's less than $100. People really don't pay with cash anymore. Well, except you. Here, you want your change back? You're really being a buzz kill, Sheila. Well, you're the genius trying to rob a gas station. Is that thing even real? Fucking asshole. Shut the fuck up! Okay? Melinda, could you please tell your friend here to quit being so fucking difficult? She's not my friend. Sheila, stop being so fucking difficult. Hey, fuck you. Okay, that's enough, all right, here, thank you. Money, bag, let's go. What are you gonna do with the money? I am going to go pay off my debt to these fucking stupid bikers. Is this gonna be enough? No, apparently not. There's more money in the safe. I can get it for you. You're gonna help this asshole? Sheila, he has a gun. I have a gun. I'll go get it. How much do you need? All of it. Okay. Shouldn't you be wearing a mask or something? Uh oh. Don't you fuck around. Okay, I need this money. If I don't get it, I'll kill everybody in the store. I don't give a shit, you understand? Hey. Yes, okay, got it. - Evening. - Hi. That's $12.45. Oh, we actually don't have any change right now. You don't have any change for a 20? We just counted the register with the new shift person. Can you ring me over here? That register's not open right now. Sorry, it's a really weird situation. Credit card, is that good? - Yeah. - All right. Do you know how to get to Wrightwood from here? There's no service. It's a few miles, right? - Yeah, it's just a few miles down. Hop on 18, right, it's only a few miles? Yeah you just, um. Just a couple of miles down here. Where were you trying to go? Wrightwood. Oh, Wrightwood is simple. Just get on the 18 east and you'll be there in about 12 miles, you can't miss it. All right, thank you. Come on, let's go. What was that? I have the money all ready to go. Thank you. Melinda, you're an angel, thank you for making this so easy. Can I have the backpack? Where are you headed to after this? I'm gonna go pay off my debt and then get the hell out of wherever the hell this is. Can I go with you? What? Can you take me with you, please? Are you out of your mind? Melinda, come on. You know what, you should go. - No, no... - You two belong together. Come on, come on, Melinda. Are you being serious? Yes. Melinda, just give me the backpack, please. Take me with you, I'd like to go with you. No, that, that's not gonna happen. Okay, just give me the fucking backpack. You don't want to get involved in this. I do want to get involved. I can be useful. Melinda, I have no use for you, okay? Give me the fucking money. You do have use for me. I just got you the money from the safe. You wouldn't have gotten that without me. Yes, and I appreciate that, but Melinda, I don't have time for this. Give me the fucking backpack. Melinda, just give him the back... Stop. Melinda, give him the fucking backpack. Give me the goddamn backpack. Melinda give it. God, you are such a little bitch. Yeah, you're just a little bitch with a gun, bullying two girls. You call yourself a man? When did I ever say that I was a man? Oh good, cause you're not. You know what your fucking problem is? You don't know when to shut the fuck up. Yeah, you think I'm scared of you? Shut your fucking mouth. I'm not trying to be tough, I was nice to you. What are you gonna shoot me? Why are you being so fucking difficult? You're lucky my boyfriend isn't here right now. Oh wow, am I? Yeah, the fucking boyfriend... Yeah, he's got guns too, definitely has a bigger dick than you. Why the fuck are we talking about your boyfriend's dick? You're not tough. You want to see tough? I can... - Take your money and get the fuck outta here, like a little bitch. I fucking told you! I told you! You made this happen! I was trying to be nice and you wouldn't shut the fuck up! Melinda, lock the door. Lock the fucking door, Melinda. You need to learn how to fucking talk to people. I would have been out of her if you would have shut your dumb fucking mouth! Give me your phone, Melinda. Shh. Go in the bathroom til I tell you to come out. You know what? I'm gonna fucking teach you how to talk to people. Get up. Get the fuck up, get up. Come on. Get on your knees. - Now fuck you! - Get off me! - Dumb ass! - Fuck you! I told you to wait in the fucking bathroom! Melinda, Melinda you're stupid. Stupid idiot. Fuck. I wasn't going to shoot her. You can clean up all you fucking want, but it's your fault. Why are you cleaning it up? Huh? What are you going to tell some bullshit story to the cops when they get here? I wasn't going to shoot her. I'm not a murderer. All right, what are you going to tell the cops when they get here? Fuck, did you throw hot coffee on my face? It's fucking on fire. God. What, what the fuck are you looking at? Just looking at your face. Yeah? Yeah, well I'm sure it looks pretty fucked up, thank you. Why didn't you want me to go with you? What? When I asked to leave with you, why didn't you want me to come with you? Why? That's fucking crazy. I don't know you. There's no reason for you to get involved. This didn't have to be this complicated. I didn't think Sheila would get shot. That wasn't what I wanted. Well you made it happen. Okay, Melinda seriously, you gotta let me outta here. Okay, I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay, I just need to give them their money or else they're going to kill me. Who's gonna kill you? The bikers. The fucking clown stupid assholes who care too much about their dumb motorcycles. Okay, well they know that I'm robbing this place and if I don't give them their money, they're gonna come here looking for me. Well, why didn't you just leave with me then? You haven't called the cops, have you? What's your plan? I'm not sure. Listen, Melinda, you and I are in a lot of trouble right now. At this point, you're my accomplice. You helped me get the money. Because you threw hot coffee on my face, Sheila is dead. And at some point, someone's gonna figure out that Sheila's dead, so let's get out of here while we still can together. Look, I know I can trust you now because we're on the same team. But I was always on your team. I got you the money from the safe. You're right. I just didn't want you to get in trouble. I didn't want you to get hurt. I didn't want anybody to get hurt. Except Sheila. No. Instead of leaving with me, you decided to stay and try to have sex with her. I wasn't trying to have sex with Sheila. Melinda, I lost my temper. Okay, it's a problem that I have and it's something that I'm working on, but what were you gonna do? What, you gonna come with me? To deliver the money? I mean, come on, if those guys, if they saw you, a pretty, pretty girl like you, with me, they could have murdered you. They could have raped you, just to get back at me. I didn't want that, okay? I mean I guess, also why I didn't say yes was I didn't believe you. Believe what? Believe that you'd actually want to leave with me. I wasn't lying to you. No. Yeah, no, I believe you now. It's just, it didn't make sense to me at the time, why you'd want to come away with me. I'm breaking the law because I have to. I don't want to be doing this, okay? And it didn't make sense to me that someone like you would want to just throw their life away and take off with a stranger with a gun. I mean, I know I'm handsome, but. Unless, you were just planning on robbing the place yourself. Or you're just that unhappy with your life. Are you? Are you that unhappy with your life? I mean you do work at a gas station. There's nothing wrong with working at a gas station. I meet a lot of interesting people. Gas stations are community gathering centers. Oh. There was this famous architect named Frank Lloyd Wright, everyone thought he was a genius and he was obsessed with gas stations. He even built this really artistic one in Minnesota. He said in the future, gas stations will be where every town would gather to socialize and talk and get to know one another. I'm going to visit it one day. Wow, that's very interesting. I didn't think of it that way, I guess, yeah. I mean on a busy shift, I usually meet around 240 customers. Some of them are regulars, but I'm always meeting new people, unless I work a graveyard shift like tonight. After midnight, I sometimes only meet like 20 people. And then you meet an asshole like me, but hey, I'm glad I met you. People don't usually give me the chance to get to know me. They usually want to get to know Sheila. Fuck Sheila. Melinda, I've met 1000 girls like Sheila and there's nothing special about her. But you, you and I? We're a lot alike. In a good way. We go for what we want. I would love a cigarette. Do you have a cigarette? Yeah. Thanks. I still can't believe you threw hot coffee in my face. Burns like hell. It's not a bad thing. I burn myself all the time. See? You're just feeling a quick change. I know it hurts, but it doesn't have to be a bad thing. Fire just forces things to change really fast. Like when a forest burns down, it all just grows back even better. And the fire was just turning it back to what it used to be in the first place. Okay, Melinda, you know how I really want to keep talking with you, but I could use some Advil or something. If you wouldn't mind. Hey. I'm really sorry about all this. You deserve better. I wish I would have just left with you. Oh, thank you. Mm, mmhmm. Thanks. Hey, you know what I was thinking? I really want to go see that gas station in Montana you were talking about. That sounds so cool. All right, once we get out of town, that's the first place we're gonna go. I want to leave with you, but I just need to figure out what to tell my boyfriend. You have a boyfriend? I do, yeah. Has he, will he be worried about you or... Maybe. But I don't care. I want to leave with you like you said. Right, it just makes things a lot more complicated. It's not that big of a deal, I don't really like him anyway. Okay, uh, okay yeah, but how about this, how about I go alone to give them the money and then you stay here and you call the cops and once they get here, you can just tell them that somebody robbed the store and then shot Sheila and then once that's all sorted, we'll meet back up and then we'll get out of town before anybody realized what happened. Don't you want to leave together still? Yes, but you have a boyfriend. Is that gonna stop you? No, but Melinda, it just makes things really complicated for us to leave right now. Does it still hurt? Uh yeah, yeah, thanks for reminding me. Wa... Thanks. Melinda, you know what? Look, if you really don't give a fuck about your boyfriend, then let's do it, let's go, but only if we do it right now. Okay? Come on, what are you doing? Fuck. My heart. Okay, Melinda, Did you fucking drug me? Oh come on, Melinda. Stop fucking around, okay, let's go. Let's get the fuck out of here, please. Oh no, no, no. Stop please, please stop, please. No, what are you doing, what are you doing? Oh. Look, we can do this later, okay? Just, let's get out of here. I know you're lying to me. I know you don't like me. The second I untie you, I know you're gonna kill me. I know this is all a lie. But I'm going to be okay with it. God, fuck! Fucking bitch. Since when the hell do you all close at night? I've been out there 10 minutes banging on that door. Hey where's the regular coffee? We don't have any right now. Don't have any right now? You're a damn gas station. Can you make some? No. We have iced coffee and energy drinks in the fridge. Energy drinks? That's goddam ridiculous. No hot coffee. I can't have energy drinks. I can get a damn heart attack, lose control of the wheel, hit a bus. What the hell? I don't even know what half this shit is. What ever happened to coffee? Why do we have to have choices? This whole country, this whole country is going to hell in a handbag. Look, I don't know what your issue is, but I just want some coffee. Can I pay for this? Please just take what you want and leave. Look, I'm not asking for any handout. Please just leave me alone. Filson County, 911 where's your emergency? Hello? This is a 911 operator... - Hey, Melinda. What are you doing? Where's Sheila at? She's not here. What do you mean she's not here? What'd she leave already? She's not here anymore. Uh, what's the matter? Nothing. Trying to call her for like an hour. She knew I was picking her up, but what, did she get a ride? Who the hell gave her a ride? I don't know, I didn't see. I just know she's gone. Well what did she say to you? Well was she mad at me? I told her I was finishing up at the shop. Dammit, she always does this shit. If I see her, I'll let you know. Yeah. What is that? Shh. Is that her phone vibrating? What's her phone doing on the ground? She can't go two minutes without her phone. Where is she? She still here? No, she left. You're, you're not lying to me, are you? She's not like in the bathroom or in the back or something? Because if she left, she's gonna realize that her phone is missing in like two minutes and come back for it. Why do you keep crying? I'm sorry. Look, hey, hey hey, Melinda, listen to me, it's okay. All right, this is my girl we're talking about. All right, I just, I don't give a shit. All right, if she's mad at me or if she got you to lie for her, all right? I just need to know where she is all right, and that she's okay. That's all that matters to me, all right? That's all I care about. Look, if if you're lying to me and something happens to her, Melinda, I swear to god... She left with a guy. Shut up, a guy? What guy? I don't know, I'd never seen him before. What do, what did, what did he look like? Some guy, had like a jean jacket on. Well, did she know him? Were they like touchy or something together? Yeah. I think they went to a motel or something. A what? Uh, did you get his name? Was he named Devon, was it Devon? I didn't hear it, I'm really sorry. What motel did they go to, Melinda? I don't know. Everything just happened really fast. Okay, okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to the Motel 6, on the 18, all right? If she comes back for her phone, you tell her I have it. All right, she better wait here for me. All right, do not let her leave before I get back. Okay. All right, thanks for telling me, Melinda. Can I help you guys? Yeah, we were thinking about going in the store and uh, buying some things. I'm sorry, I'd really like to help you guys, and normally I would, but right now, the store is closed. The sign says 24 hours. Yes, but not today's 24 hours. Did something happen here tonight? No, nothing happened. I'm just cleaning up a little mess. We're looking for a friend of ours, little wannabe cowboy type, bout this tall with his high heel boots on? You'd know him if you saw him. Do you guys do illegal things? Of course not. You don't accidentally kill people and get rid of dead bodies? What kind of people do we look like? We're just looking for our friend. I haven't seen him. How are you so sure? Well he said I'd know if he came and I don't know if he came, so nothing happened. I'm gonna get some smokes. Uh, excuse me, I said we're closed. You can't go in. In fact, I was just going to lock the door. You can do that right after I get my... I said you can't go in. What are you doing? What are you doing? Have you lost your fucking mind? It's very possible. Now can you please just leave? I am, I am just really, really busy right now. Put your pieces down. What? You heard me, put em away. There's cameras everywhere. No need to make a scene. She says the store's closed, I guess it's closed. We're gonna take a look around. And if we don't find our friend, we're coming back. Maybe the store will be open by then. Oh, Melinda. Are you okay? Is there anyone else in here with you? No, it's just me. You're here by yourself? Yes. Did you notice anyone suspicious come through? Uh, I don't know. Who's suspicious? You can put your hands down. There's a gray Toyota Camry in the parking lot, right next to your van. That's the stolen vehicle I'm looking for. Did you notice it outside? No. Keys were still in the ignition. When was the last time you looked outside? Maybe 20 minutes ago? Okay. Check the tapes. Tom 66, 1124 on the 503, copy. Uh Lou, you don't need to use codes every time. Just say it. Stolen vehicle abandoned at Paradise Pumps on the 63. Suspect missing, I'll clear the location. Melinda, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I don't think we can look at the tapes though. I can't access them. Well who has access? Diane? Yes, but she's not here. I hate to have her drive down at this hour. Eh, I gotta do it. What's her number? Uh, she's definitely sleeping right now. I hear what you're saying. I hate to wake her, but I'm just trying to do my job, you know, just follow procedure. What's her number? I actually, I remember now something suspicious happening. Oh, okay, let's call Diane first and once she's on her way, then I want to hear what you have to tell me. That way we're firing on all cylinders and not wasting any time, okay? Okay. They should really give you the keys. You're the most dependable one here. And I think you're right. She's probably asleep. Yeah, she was really tired, plus I don't think you'll... Hold on, let me try again. What? Sometimes when you, it takes a couple of tries. You know, when you call twice, people generally take that as an emergency. Diane? Hi, I'm sorry to wake you, this is Officer Lou of the Filson County sheriff's department. Yes, hi. Uh, we have a situation here at the Paradise Pumps and we're gonna need to see the surveillance tapes ASAP. Yeah, Melinda's right here. She says you're the only one that has access to them. Uh huh. I'm sorry, Diane, I know this is unfair, but we have a situation... I'm not authorized to give you a raise. I personally can't compensate you to drive down here... As a police officer, I'm ordering you to come down with the keys and show me the tapes. Is that clear? Thank you. She's a very negative person. Okay. So what were you saying? I was saying that I remember something suspicious now. About half an hour ago, someone came in asking about the nearest hotel and I told them about the Motel 6 by the 18. He was the last person I saw since that car showed up and I think he left in a green Jeep. And you're saying this person was suspicious, how? He was just suspicious. You can take my word for it. Okay, um... Sorry I couldn't remember that earlier when you were pointing the gun at me. I apologize about that. I didn't mean to scare you. I'm fine. You might actually be able to catch him still if you leave right now. Did you get a license plate? Uh no. Well, that's one hell of a first night. Tom 66, possible suspect in a green Jeep, be on the look out for all green Jeeps near the 18. All right, I'm gonna go check out the Motel 6 and by the time I get back, Diane should be here and we'll check the tapes. I'm just gonna do a quick sweep of the store just to make sure we're all clear. Quick sweep. Yeah, it's just procedure. But I said he's not here. Melinda, is everything all right? Yes. You keep asking me that and I keep telling you, yes. Do you not believe me? Hey, if there's something you know or is there something wrong, you know you can tell me, right? I just want to make sure you're safe and I don't want anything happening to you. I care about you. You don't need to say that. Say what? I know you're just doing your job. You're always just doing your job. You don't need to say all that extra stuff to me. You've never said it to me before, you don't need to say it now. It's too late. I'm sorry, but I mean it when I say I care about you. You don't even really know who I am, so. It's not real. I'm gonna go sweep the premises. All right, everything looks good. I'll go check on the Motel 6. Who has the morning shift? Uh, I'm not sure. Okay. I'll go check on the Jeep. I'll be back. Okay. You didn't find anything strange? Nope, just like you said. I believed you the whole time. If you see anything or need anything, my cell phone number's on this card. You can call me directly. Hello? Melinda? This is your last chance! Do not fuck with me! Melinda! Okay, stop. Can you just stop now, please? I'll burn this whole place down right now. The floor is covered with gasoline. Give me the fucking backpack. You can have it if you let me go and and if you don't tell anybody what happened, I'll give it to you. What's going on? What are you doing? Uh, it won't open. The security locks the doors when the power's out. Why is the power out? Did Sheila come back? Melinda, is Sheila here? Hey. Melinda! Where are you going? Hey, who are you? Listen you... Whoa, whoa, what happened to you? You've got to trust me... - Back up. - Okay, okay. She's fucking crazy, man. She burned my fucking face. She tied me to a chair, she tried to rape me.

Hey stop it, just, you can have it, just leave. You can take it and leave just like you wanted to. Stop! Stop! Stop it. Officer Lou? Hi, it's Melinda. No, it's not okay. Lou, can you please just come back, I... No, just listen, I, I lied. I lied about the guy, I... Yes, I think so, but the door's locked and the power's out and I can't get out. The money's right there on the counter. Please, you can just take it and leave. I'm sorry. I really didn't mean for all of this to happen. Please, I'll burn the whole place down and we can just forget it. You were gonna take the fuckin' money and run, weren't you? Yes, but I thought you were dead and I just figured, but you can have it. It's all there, I promise. Oh and your gun, don't forget that. You can have that too. Look the police are gonna be here any minute. You, you called the police? Yes, but you still have time. You can just leave. You can just leave. This didn't have to be complicated, Melinda. I know. You made me into a killer. I don't think I made you kill anybody. I mean, you definitely didn't need to kill Perry. He was just really in love with Sheila. You're right, I'm sorry, I screwed up. Stop with all your fucking, I'm sorry's. You drugged me and tried to rape me. Do you think that you were just gonna get away with that? I just, I just wanted to be with someone. I just I just forgot what I wanted. What, what are you gonna tell the cops when they get here? Are you going to tell them about me? Are you going to tell them about you? I'll tell them the truth. All of it. The truth. Hm, no. No, that's, that's not gonna be enough, not after what you did. Melinda, Melinda, come on, come on. Come on, got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. Okay, here we go, let's go. Come on. Okay, don't be scared, we'll get you to safety. Come on. Watch your head, watch your head. Hold tight here, everything's going to be okay. Help is on the way.
