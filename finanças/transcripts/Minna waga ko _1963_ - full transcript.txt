I'm going to ask a student. - Takeo! - Yes! It's a bomber. Sano! Yes! It's a bomber. - Are you sure? - Yes. Eh, really? Well... uhm... Look at you! What can you do with that weak mindset? Good. You can sit. This is a bomber. Listen. You will become airmen for the Japanese Empire. In order to do that, you should prepare yourself with your heart. Understood? - So, you will... - Alert! Calm down! It's a false alert! There was no info about an alert today. Nashimoto City is under airstrike by B-29. Evacuate immediately! - Evacutate immediately! - It can't be! B-29... Evacuate! Cover yourself! Don't push! Calm down, everyone! Sachiko! Sachiko! Sa-chan! - Are you okay? - Big sis! Wait, wait! Don't stay away from each other! Hey, everyone, look! Principal! Principal! Principal, it's a flyer. This is a trick! Get out with the children! Yes sir! The young blood of the Naval Preparatory Flight Trainers The field on the 7th hill is full of cherry blossoms We fly over Kasumiga Bay again today And the large clouds and rivers are in our sight The burning enthusiasm of the Naval Preparatory Flight Trainers With the Power of 100 Million People My skill is like Kurogane, and my heart is like Hidama The 3rd Unit of Higahioka Elementary School, Tokyo - Miss! - We're back! Welcome back! - Ms. Ryoko, do you have any letter for us? - Yes, did it arrive? - I don't have any today. - That’s lame. Welcome back. Hey! Wipe your feet! Here! - Welcome back. - We're back! Have you read the flyer? It made me angry. - Mother, what did you do with them? - Mr. Kitani collected them all. Mister, is it true? That's the trick of the enemy. Okay! Everyone, go! - Everyone should wash your hands! - Yes! - First! - I am the first! It's me! - What's up? - I asked you earlier. - Whose is this? - Show me now! I cannot see. - Don't tell the teacher. - We won’t. Go watch. Okay! "Everyone in Japan, American soldiers conquered Okinawa." "If Japan does not surrender immediately, we will soon bomb you." Blah! Bad handwriting… - But could it be true? - It must be fake. Idiot! This is a trick! What are you doing? Ah, the flyer? Show me! No! Stop it! - You can't! No, you can't! - Do it! - What do you think you're doing? - Give it back! Hey! It's the teacher! It's the teacher! What's that? Let me see. Show me! Who was it? You girls? Don't be silent! Who was it? Who brought it secretly? C'mon, tell me. You’re not saying? You don't have to do it. As a consequence, everyone won't have a meal today! Is it okay? Is it? Teacher! I was the one! I brought it here... Listen! Japan has never been defeated by an enemy. Think about the Kamikaze, they went through the clouds... ...toward the enemy vessel with a perfect accuracy! Don't worry! Japan is the Country of God! We will definitely win! Meal! Meal time! Ah, no! Thank everyone for providing food to us! Have a good meal! Emergency! Okinawa is in danger! What? Okinawa? After being in a fierce battle for a month, a last battle was being carried out... ...in some parts of the Wako District, in Okinawa. We lost communication with them. We don't rule out the possibility that everyone is dead. The prefectural soldiers, including student boys, are getting ready at the moment. The last status report is expected on June 22... What is going on? The enemy is attacking the prefecture as a whole. We need army support… The flyer was true… Huh! No Kamikaze anymore! Damn! Let's have the sweets! Mr. Kitani is not here. Mr. Nishio and his wife neither. That's it. Now or never! Yoichi! Get them for me! When it's closed, it's just next to the teacher's drawers. I saw that his eyes were fixed on it. Okay? - Go! - It's very simple! You just have to open slowly and pull. I will give you the largest portion. They're delicious. Okay? Get going! - You can do it. - They are delicious. Yoichi! No! Don't go! You shut up! Stealing is bad! What? Other people do it too. Teachers might be doing it secretly. You owe me. Or I will tell the truth about the flyer. Got it? Go! - You can’t! - Don't disturb him! Let him go! - Yoichi! - Stop interfering! - I will tell the teacher! - What? Big sis! - What's your problem? - Stop it! Don't be violent! What? What's your problem, know-it-all? - You are the wrong one. - Don't challenge me! Ouch! You bastard! Stop! - Yoshida! Yoshida! - Stop! Yoshida! - Get him! - Do it! How is it? Do you surrender? Then say so! Hey! He's here! I will let you go with this. Ah, that was scary. Only two bags? No choice! Close the door! - Stand in line. - Give it to me. Thank you very much! Make it faster. That's mean. - I can give you some. - I don't need any! Here. Here. Have as much as you want! Full of delicious sweets! Don't waste any. Sachiko! Hey, know-it-all! I can give you some too. It tastes good. Ah, delicious! That's not powerful enough! Hold it higher! Hold it lower! Hey! What are you doing with your ass out? Hey! Listen! You can't beat the enemy like that! Attention! Turn left! Proceed! Next! Charge forward! What's up, everyone? Good morning! Huh? You have some energy there. Everyone! Wake up! C'mon, wake up! - Teacher, good morning! - Ah, good morning. Michiko, Akiko... - Wake up! - Teacher is here... - Sachiko, time to wake up! - I’m sleepy… Ah, good morning! - I couldn't sleep at all last night. - It must have been too tiring. Don't be a weakling. That was not a hard training at all. Get yourselves together! Big sis, get up quickly! - Is something wrong? - My head is a bit… - No fever though. - It's nothing, I am fine. What's up, Satsuki? - Hey! - My head hurts... What? Your head? Hey! Another time! It can’t be helped. Don't you feel embarrassed in front of 1st and 2nd graders? - Did you wet your futon again? - Hey! What a mess you've made! You always pee all the time! Stop it, won't you? - Good morning. - Good morning. Omiya! What are you girls doing? We don't know... You don't know? I just saw what you were doing! You don't even feel ashamed of yourselves? That's the most shameful thing a human can do. Uh? Don't you think that’s wrong? We think it's wrong, but… But what? Everybody is hungry. Everybody is trying hard to overcome the hardship with the scarce resources. You are breaking that harmony! Please, don't let me help with your meal preparation. I know it's wrong. I know it is... Then who will prepare the meal? - If you think it's wrong… - Forgive them please, teacher. I do understand Omiya's feelings. While preparing the meals, I myself sometimes feel like doing it too... - Ouch. - I'm sorry. It hurts... Ah, it feels good... Ah, finished! The bath is available now! - Dirty! - Ah! Scratching here and there… My sis is not like you! - We don't have them on our heads! - Cut your hair! How about becoming a bald monk? "How about becoming a bald monk?" "How about becoming a bald monk?" Satsuki, you have a visitor. Your mother. Really? Hey, really? Really. She's waiting downstairs. - Don't be too childish! - Mama’s boy! Satsuki! Satsuki! What's up? Is everything okay, hm? All the families are doing the same. Your older brother was drafted but he was happy that he didn't have to study anymore. Your father wakes up every morning saying: "Ah, I am hungry." What's wrong, hm? Ah, strange... - Is it hard here? - No. Right. Mother here... ...made something you like. Do you recognize this, eh? Look! Wow. Is it sweet, hm? C'mon, have some more. - It's fine! - Why? I will eat with everyone later. I made a lot for everyone. Okay? Mother wants to see you eat. Eat! Eat! My mother must be busy. It's okay to take time. You can enjoy the waiting time better. Our mother will bring something delicious for us. For sure! Ah, I want to eat. Hey, the one we ate at your house before the evacuation. It was delicious. Yoichi's mother prepared it. I went to a zoo with my mother before the evacuation. It was not something luxurious. But I ate norimakis in front of the monkeys, this big! Ah! Mother! Mother! What are you doing? Annoying! Ah, Mother! Please have some time to come visit! Don't make stupid noises! I don't like visits! That's right. They don't come anyway. I don't want to see my mother's face, right? - Right? - Right? What's with that talk? You don't even have a mother. Ah, that's right. I forgot... - Donation! - Donation! - Donation from his mother! - Everyone! Eat one each! What? My mother prepared one more. Eat, everyone! Don't push! - That's good! - Thank you very much! You're disturbing my work. I’m not finished yet, silly. You should not wet the futon next time, okay? Miss. What is it? Please deliver this to my mother when you go back to Tokyo. If the teachers find out, they will edit them. So please do it secretly. - Mine too. - Alright. - Good night. - Good night. If we write that we are hungry, the teachers will get angry. Is that so? - Excuse me. - Yes? Please, sit properly. - Everyone envies him. - Yes. Please let him sleep upstairs. Ah, the futon has been cleaned up. - I’m extremely sorry for that. - It's nothing. He has had a weak body since he was young. His conditions weren't good. Mother put a new futon here. Let's go, okay? Go. Have a good night. Satsuki! Fathers and mothers from Tokyo, have a good night! - One, five, six, seven. - Caught it! Over there! There! Ah, brothers! Brothers! Are you doing okay? Meat and butter! - Salmon and sardine! - Ah, amazing! Caramel and sweet-beans jelly! Rice! Lots of it! Okay, we showed everything! Kyoko, please make a good meal for everyone with this. Yes. I will show my skills! What do you want, everyone? Mixed rice! Silence! Well... I want an onigiri with sesame seeds on it. - Do you like onigiri? - No! Mother of Soldiers Finally, it's time to separate. - Yes! - Here... I wanted to show you in uniform to your late father. Mother... Please take care of yourself. If I die, you need to take care of yourself alone. You have to care about how much you can achieve. Your mother will only be praying for that every day. Mother! Don't cry! Why are you crying like a little girl? Your mother won't cry! Smile and live! Yes! When the deadly sun rises toward us in the morning 100 million people are supporting us I am prepared with my body and spirit… I am going now! I will devote my life to the country! Please take care, Mother! Ichiro! You are my precious son! Hug me one last time... ...so that I can remember you in my heart. Mother! Ichiro! Hurry up! Great! - Do it faster! - What? What do you want? Wako Elementary School, Nashimoto City Tokyo Higashioka Elementary School Evacuation Headquarter Please. I beg you. I will leave immediately as soon as I see him. It is unfortunate. As you can see there... ...the number of monthly visits is limited. Can you allow me to see him? I have no one other than him in my family. I've been patient until now. However... ...when I saw this letter from Junichi, I couldn't help myself. I am worried that he would get sick. I will deliver that message to him. I am having a hard time myself too. However, if I let you in, that rule won't be kept anymore. Once you're gone, every single one of them will ask for their turn. That will be unfair to all of them. Teacher... what is it? Are all of the kids already asleep? Yes. Could you let her see Junichi? Of course, while he's sleeping. That way, it won't break the rules. - Mother, you should remember that too. - Yes. Follow me please. I'm sorry for the trouble. - Ah, please wait for a bit. - Yes. Please come in. Over there. - Do not wake him up. - No... - See you. - Thank you very much. Junichi! Junichi! It's me, your mother. Your mother is here. Junichi! I've wanted to see you. Your mother was wanting to see you. I'm glad you are doing okay. Junichi! Your mother only has you. I only think about you. Every day, I work hard in Tokyo. It's hard, but I do my best... for your sake! - Sorry for being late. - Welcome back. - Welcome back. - Welcome back. I'm leaving. - See you. - What will be today's meeting about? - I'm leaving. - See you. I heard something serious over a phone call. What was it about? One of the students of the 5th corps was found to have an STD. An STD? Did somebody bully her or something? They think it might be caused by one of other students. The news has reached other schools as well. So she will face suspension. Poor thing. That's scary. We have a public bath too. This is complicated. What should we report to the police? But it's not the teachers' responsibility. No, it is the teachers' responsibility. But if this problem gets bigger, the army will intervene. Anyway, this is not an easy problem. We should find a good solution. That's right. When you take a bath, you should take a big step in order to avoid bacteria. Understood? Okay, try it now. Take a big step, avoiding contact. That's right. And do not sit down completely. Keep your knees up, like this. Let's see you do it. That's right. Good! Like that. That's right. That's great! Can you do it? Good! No problem. No bacteria either. But she is weak and doesn't have any appetite. - She also has a mild fever. - It's from stress. It's common during war. It's sometimes called "evacuee disease." It's often circulated among soldiers as well. The mental health compromised by the environment makes the body weaker. Once she gets back home, she will get better right away. No medicine is required. - Okay then. - Thank you. What do you think? Do you really want to go home? No, I don't want to go home. Good! That's how you do it. With that attitude, try hard until the end! I will let my wife make some treats for you later. Big sis, everything is okay. - I'm glad it's not a big deal. - I hate this. - She is faking it. - She just wants to have some treats. That's mean! I want to be sick as well. You treats thief! No! I don't need anything! You and me, we are the cherry-blossom comrades We bloom beautifully at the same air force unit Once flowers bloom, they should prepare for falling Let's fall gladly for the country's sake You and me, we are the cherry-blossom comrades We bloom beautifully at the same air force unit I am coming in! - A doughnut for you! - Ah, that’s great! It has sugar. It's delicious. How did you get this? It's a farewell party for Kyoko today. She gave them to us. They have to leave early tomorrow morning. So they wanted to have fun tonight. Last farewell? Yes. It's delicious. - What is it? - It's the north. - It’s strange... - Let's go see! Repatriate, depart! Repatriate! What's a repatriate? Do you know where did I go? Yes! Tokyo! That's right. Everybody has been worried, right? There was an airstrike in Tokyo 2 days ago. Higashioka was significantly damaged. I was worried too, so I went there immediately. Now, everyone! Sit up straight! Not too much or you’re going to fart. Don't push yourselves. The school, principal's home, Kitani and Nishino's home... ...and, of course, everybody's home, were intact. However, I was informed that, after the airstrike, every one of your parents were safe and sound. It was really fortunate. Sit comfortably now. Whatever happens over there, you have to try hard here. I believe everyone will try hard from now on. Teachers are expecting so much from you. That's all. How was it? Are you disappointed? - No, we aren’t! - I am okay! I will try hard as much as our parents do over there! I will try hard! We will as well! Great! You are proud citizens of Japan. And I have one more thing to tell you. I've talked with your principal in Tokyo. This village might have an airstrike one day. To protect everyone, we will leave this place to get into the mountain. The mountain is good! Teacher, when are we moving? When things are confirmed, Teacher Kitani will tell you more specifically. Yes! And because there are no doctors in the mountain... ...unhealthy people will remain in Ozura, not far from here. We will announce who will be remaining later. Others have to pack your stuff. We are going to the place where birds live. Right? I won't be there when you go to the mountain. So you have to do everything by yourself. Yes. Don't drink random water. Be careful with that. I will do the same. Yes. I'm giving this to you. Yoichi! Take care of Sachiko, okay? Okay. Come to the mountain as soon as you get better. We will have food everywhere. The scenery will be good too. It will be like a vacation home. Oh! Everyone is trying hard. Don't leave anything behind! Teacher! I want to go to the mountain too! I want to bring you as well. I don't want to leave anyone behind. But you are not healthy enough. There are no doctors in the mountain. In case of emergency, we wouldn’t have an option. Also, you have to solve your issue here. If you come along, you will make things more complicated. I will come for you when I have time. Satsuki, I am staying too. So let's become close friends. Everything is fine, right? Satsuki, you are a strong Japanese boy, right? Here. Teacher, please take care of Sachiko in the mountain. She is scared of everything. Don't worry. The two of you will get better soon and come to the mountain. Yes! I will do my best! That's right, that's right! I will pick you up soon. You can do it! - Yes! - Good! Everyone, listen! Tomorrow, we’ll wake up at 4:30 and leave at 6! Everyone, go to sleep early today! Okay? Yes! We will go forward with invincible loyalty and bravery Our heart will be full of the honor of the shining country Teacher, are we there yet? - Not yet? - Are we there yet? Not yet? Teacher, are we there yet? - How long do we have to go? - Are we arriving soon? Stop walking! - Stop! - Stop walking! Stop! Okay, after this hill, we will see Uzawa Village. Everyone should try a bit more... ...and enter the village without disturbing the people that live there. Okay? Yes! Welcome Uzawa Elementary School Uzawa Village Office We will go forward with invincible loyalty and bravery Our heart will be full of the honor of the shining country - Poor things... - Separated from their parents... Can we take care of all of them? - I am not sure either. - The village will be busier, right? Mayor? Even if we are currently cornered, this is an important job for us. We should protect them no matter what! Everyone! Stop! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Attention! Tokyo is in that direction! Turn left! Hats off! Bow down towards the destination! Original position! Next, let's greet your parents! Father and mother, good morning! Father and mother, good morning! How is the life in the mountain? I got used to it finally. I never knew a safe place like this would exist. We have never heard of airstrike alerts from here. If we can have more food here, everything will be better. Yes... - Good morning. - Good morning. You are doing well given the situation. I mean you have to take care of 30 children. I've brought green beans for miso soup. - Ah, thank you very much. - Thank you. I thought we were hunting a raccoon or a fox. The Buddha statue will get damaged by this smoke. Be careful! It's getting complicated, right? He is such a stubborn guy. - He only cares about his temple. - Right. And he shows a hatred for people in general. He doesn't have a wife or kid. So he must be off mentally, right? Anyway, I think men are not supposed to live like that... Good morning to you! - Like this? - Yes, put your finger into it. - Is this okay? - Yes. Like this, right? With this, everyone will have their own shoes. It's difficult... - Like that. - Ah, wait a second! Excuse me for that. What? Toilet? That’s bothersome. - Me too! - Me too! Any other wants to go? Me too! I can do it here! Idiot! If you do it here, the teacher will scold you. Wait! Me too! It's nothing. A ghost! Help us! Help us! What's up? - What happened? - What was that sound? Oh, dear! It was Buddha's mercy! Myoho rengue kyo Myoho rengue kyo The mayor said that if the monk was disturbing... ...we could turn over the temple. What? He'll face the punishment! How dare he say such things in front of the Buddha? But the kids feel uncomfortable. Please, think about the poor kids. Also, we need a proper bath... It's troublesome! No way! Listen! I don't think you know anything. But, this temple is very precious. It was even on the National Treasure list once. If I change things that easily, I will not see my ancestors' faces later. I've never heard that. I've never heard that this temple has ever been on the National Treasure list... ...during my tenure as the mayor. Instead, I've heard too much rumors that you're trying hard to make it on the list. I am not talking about the temple itself! I am saying that you cannot break the rules of the temple! I am not even talking about it now. But, ware you going to do with supplies? We have too many people for a limited food supply. Am I right? Don’t you think so too? What do you all think? It doesn't matter what we think. It happened like this and there's no other way. We are doing this for the country. I think the only reason why you are this angry... ...is because you saw a young naked woman... ...and broke the holy rule in front of the holy Buddha. That's ridiculous! Ridiculous! Ms. Nishino, it was such an unholy thing, right? Give me. - Here. - Good! - Give me. - Here. - Next. - Yes. Oh! There it is! This is my 30th. I broke yesterday's record! This is my 28th. My number is low, but it's big. Where it is? Here! It can be a big sumo player! It can't compare to mine! Look at this! It’s bigger and it's moving! Do you want to have a sumo match? - Bring it on! - Good! - Hey, you! - Ah! Are you still doing it? I told you not to catch lice in front of the Buddha! Go home, go home! Take that, take that! Dong, dong! Nam myoho rengue kyo You bad boys! One... two... Three... four... - Five... - Mommy! - Mommy! - Stop it. Give me sweets. I want them, mommy! Stop it already. Come here. You should stop disturbing your mother. If you disturb me too much, I won't bring you to the school. Look at the kids outside. Everybody listens to what the teachers say. Here you have. Hey! Have it here! You should not show it to others. It's not good. - It's my turn. - My turn! - No, it's Sachiko's turn! - That's right. Have you been good kids? Teacher, we made this much. Wow! Quite much! Good job! Ah, hello. - Ah, hello! - Thank you for everything! It's nothing. Good, put them into this! Everybody has diarrhea because we only have soybeans. Poor kids! Not that you are in a good situation either. You don't know how long you have to take care of them here. Kazue! Okay, let's come back tomorrow. - Put them into this. - Teacher. Would you bring some udon for the kids to eat? - But that will be too much trou... - Teacher, please, bring us some udon! - Teacher, please make it! - Teacher, teacher, we want to eat! Ah! There it is. Hey, everyone! I found a crab! Come here quickly! - Hey, over there! There! - Where? Ah, found it! What's its kind? - It's so little! - What a cute crab. Hey, know-it-all! Is this edible? There are 600 kinds of crabs. In this village, there is only one. Ah, it has a pincher. It's true. It's a male if the right pincher is big. Anyway, can we eat this? I've never eaten a crab. Well, I think we can eat it. Let's test it. I’m trying it first. Aren’t you going to be sick? Eat! Eat! Just eat it! Hey, everyone! Let's catch crabs! Good! - Oh! There it is! - I found one! - I got one! - Look at it! - Yoshioka, here! - There are so many! Don't touch me! Go away! That smells good. - Be served! - Let me see... Hot, hot, hot! Is it tasty? - Can we eat? - Is it delicious? How is it? Tasty! I want one too! - Give me one! - Give me one! - Bleh! - You stingy! Oh, no! You shouldn't eat toothpaste! Here. Don't eat medicine like that too. It's for your digestion. It will upset your stomach. What happened? You're bleeding! Show me, Gun! What, blood? Did you hurt yourself? Hey, come here, come here. Got you. What happened? Do you have a cut somewhere? Open your mouth! Teacher. That's not blood. It's watercolor. - Paint? - He ate watercolor. Did he eat watercolor? Why did you eat watercolor? It's poisonous! But it's tasty. - That's right, do you agree? - Yes. It's very sweet. You ate that too? Who knew they would eat watercolor? Come here! Come here! Wait! Wait! Everyone has to share them! Shut up! I give you each some! We took them first! You promised you'd share with everyone! - That's right. We work as one group! - One of 100 million people! Girls, shut up! Go catch them by yourselves! Girls will get pinched! What are you doing? Give it back to me! Give them to us! We will share them! That's right! - You can do it, know-it-all! - We will support you! Give them to us! Give them to us! Ah, that's dangerous! - What are you doing? - Let's do it! You wanna fight? Everyone! Separate! Calm down! Calm down! Go back to your house! Stop it now! I couldn't just stand there doing nothing for the poor kids. What can we do about this? I wasn't expecting that a monk like you would interested in taking care of kids... He must have high pride. Don't be ridiculous! There should be no distraction for monks. At this age, I never knew I would have to deal with lice. Well… they used to say that lice are a type of Buddha. It's not a funny matter! But there is no solution, priest. They are already trying hard. That's right. Everybody is doing their best. There is no use for me to say this. But without young men, women and old people can have hard time providing for themselves. I didn't want to say this, but our fields have been messed up by the kids. Thank you for attending, everyone! - Thank you! - It’s nothing big, just tea. Have them please. It's a difficult problem. Perhaps, the situation has become what the priest initially said. When the summer recession comes, they may have no other choice. I am not sure of that. Didn't you cry when we accepted them? Could it be that those tears were fake? That's right! Once upon a time, there was a giraffe right next to a forest Everyone always laughed at the bald mountain - Teacher, I've found something good. - What is it, Mr. Igoro? Something really delicious! - Wow! - What could it be? Show me your hands! - Teacher, wake up! Teacher! - What happened, hm? You big fool! Here. Look! It's done! Everyone. - We've roasted the snake. - Ah, no! - If you want to eat, raise your hand! - Yes! Hey, Nashimoto City is under airstrike! Nashimoto is under airstrike! - Nashimoto is under airstrike! - Airstrike, airstrike! - How is it? - What happened? Teacher Komata! Teacher, will everyone in Hashimoto be alright? I think it’s possible that they’re alright, however... I will check them. I'll count on you here. Please do! Hey, they're here! Welcome! Brother! Big sis! Big sis! - Have you seen my sister? - Yuko! Oh, Satsuki is not here! - Satsuki! - Satsuki! Ah, thank you. When we were retreating around 50 km away... ...Satsuki Yasumoto was killed right there and Hideo Kimura was injured badly. Everyone is mostly okay, but all of the people from Nashimoto were killed. - It was like a living hell. - That sounds serious. Teacher, how is Hideo Kimura? Big sis! Big sis! Don't cry, okay? Your sister is all right. Teacher, where is Hideo Kimura right now? There is an emergency medical center for injured people. Everyone is there. Let me go there. Go, but you need to hurry. Other teachers will take over your role for now. Let's go see your sister. Let me go there as well, teacher! Come. - Have you seen Hideo Kimura? - Big Sis! Hideo! - Big Sis! - Hideo! Teacher Akiyama! Seiichi Omura! Your brother is here! Is Teacher Akiyama here? - Hideo! - Big Sis! Teacher! Teacher Otaki! - Ms. Nishino! - Where is Hideo Kimura? Kimura is... What happened? Where is Teacher Akiyama? Akiyama is in the back. Mr. Oki, come to the office please! Teacher Akiyama... Where are you going? Stay here! - This is too much! Too much! - What are you doing? They told me that the evacuation would save him. They killed him. This is too much! Too much! - Stop it... - Give him back! - Stop it... - Give him back! Satsuki, your mother... your mother is here! I beg you, forgive me! Satsuki... Big sis! Big sis! Satsuki... Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! What's wrong? I want to go home... Here... don't cry. Mommy... Mommy! Mommy! - Rations have arrived. - Rations! - Hello! - Hello! We are here for the rations! You have rations, right? Well, they’re all burned. - Burned? - Burned rice... Due to the airstrike in Nashimoto, the rice was all burned black. You can't eat this. See how it looks like. Don't! Other things are intact. You have to wait for the rice for a while. Let's have other things for now. Please. - Anyone can make a purchase. - Give that to me. One, two, three. Here, three spinning tops! - Put them in. - Thank you very much! You can buy this only here. Anyone wants it? Okay then. I am going to add this. I will give them to you for a cheap price. Give it to me! Alright. Thank you! - How about this? - It's for you… Give it to me! - Here you have. - Thank you! Thank you very much! I am going to show you something great! A knife, a magnet and a compass. Five sweet potatoes or ten potatoes! That's expensive! Let's see it, Omura! If it's too expensive, you can pay later. - What? - Buy as many as you want! We're very sorry. We don't even have any rice to sell. In order to eat, we even have to ask our relatives. There is no other way. Hey! Go eat there! Jiro, it's lunch time! Whatever it is. We can pay a high price. No matter how much money you have. We cannot eat that. Please, go somewhere else. Didn't it work? No potatoes? They have a lot over there. - I'm getting some. - Me too. Let's have some! We'll leave money for these. Go, hurry up! Here. How much do we have to pay? - Ten, maybe? - Just pay the price for the rations. Hurry up! We can give them back later. - Where do I put this? - Anywhere is fine! Come, hurry up! - Here, teacher! - Here! - Sweet! - I didn't know it would be this sweet. We became thieves today. Your teacher doesn’t fear anyone anymore. I've scolded you so much about stealing though. - Yet we stole... - Everybody will become a thief very soon. Every japanese. - It's delicious, right? - Indeed! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Okay, stop! You can rest! - Hey, give me some cigarettes! - Yes! I think we don't have enough food. That's right. If they don't eat a lot, they will end up losing the war. Will stupid jobs like this help the soldiers? This will help them save the air fuel. I already know it! - Are they really winning, though? - Idiot! Of course, they are! We will fight with... - Kunio! - ...until the end. - Come here for a bit. - Yes. You have a visitor. Go to the house. - It's not my turn yet though. - It's okay. Just go now. Hurry up! Yes! I am going then! Kunio... Kunio! Kunio? Mother, why are you here? Why am I here? I've come here to bring you home. - Home? - That's right. The house was burned. So we're going to stay at your father's cottage in the countryside. It's totally safe there. I've already bought a ticket for you. We are leaving. I've finished all of the administration stuff in the school. Okay, quickly pack your things now! I won't go. What are you talking about? Today, at 11 PM, we will have a tea at Ueno Station with your father. - Let’s go now or it's going to be too late. - I won’t go! I cannot betray everyone! No way! If you stay here for long, you will die. I've heard from Hideo's mother... ...that everyone is being treated badly in the mountain. No matter how hard it is, I will try hard here. Until I take the air force exam. The air force exam? What is that face? Can’t I become an airman? No, it's not that. Look, Kunio... Let’s just go to the countryside where your father is, okay? At least, live with your parents, okay? Let's go... Let's go... Kunio! Kunio! Kunio! Mother... goodbye. "…Japan…broadcast…the Empire…" I understand. I share your feelings. We've been trying hard because we thought we would win. I was ready to devote my life to the country. Why did we lose? Why didn't they fight until the end? That's not it! If I knew this would be the outcome... ...I wouldn't have brought them here. Those kids... Satsuki and Hideo won't go back home. They are gone forever. So many people died. There will definitely be a moment when we can pay them back. No, we have to have that moment. I don't know... ...what I should do. The kids must feel sad too! They must be crying. We have to cheer them up. Teachers should take care of them now. Otherwise, they have no one. C'mon, let's try hard! Let's go. Choo-choo! Nam myoho rengue kyo Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Higher! Higher! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Hey! Join us! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Teacher, can we go home? - Can we go right now? - Today? Tomorrow? - Teacher, can we go? - Teacher, when? Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! - We will light things up! - Give us what you have! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! The End
