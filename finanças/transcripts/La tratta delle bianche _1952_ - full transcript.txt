One girl's missing. The tall one. Yes, I know. THE WHITE SLAVE TRADE - You're a jinx. - You pick on anything. Mister Marquedi, the tall one that didn't show on board... I've seen her today. In the borough. She hooked up with Carlo, a thief just out of prison. Great choice. Mister Marquedi, a last request: a little extra. I'm gonna win this time. Do you know how much you owe me? How will you pay it back? Everything goes back in your pockets. My pocket? I'd like that! It's not me the boss. Take it. But it can't go on like this. Thank you. And you? What do you want? How many times I've told you I don't want to see you here?! I'm young! I have the right to have fun. Let's see if you'll bring me luck. Come. If I win, we'll get crazy. Hello. - Cigarette? - No. - Please. - No. Thank you. - And you? - Yes. Do you know one Carlo Sozonsi? Never heard of him. - And you? - Never seen him. Since you've fallen in love, you've forgotten your friends? What can I say? Jail is tough. I've noticed. It made you bitter. A guy's looking for you. He might find an idiot who'll tell him where you live. Who? A guy with a car. Never seen that around here. What are you doing here? Where are you goin'? Don't get in! Go away! Get out of here! It's pretty cosy here. What are you doing here? So, you've let me down? Carlo's coming. Go! The noble heart that took you under his protection? Alright. Bravo. I've come for you, but as long as he's here... Even better! Go! Listen to me, Alda. You could make a fortune with me, you know it? You understand you're ruining your life here? If you want to change your mind, there still is time. I feel alright here. Well, hello. You were looking for me? That's right. I want to speak to you. Bring me a little water, Alda. - Shoot, I'm listening. - You see... It's a little hard to explain. But it's better to set things straight. Of course. This woman should have left. Let's say I was her agent. She let me down without a word. I understand she'd... she'd rather live with you. As far as we're concerned, every woman can choose the life she wants. But there's financial matters that have to be settled. I see. So? A pretty woman like her, it's expensive. Isn't it so? I've found her a client. I'm willing to let all this go away, if I break even! Let's say... 300,000 lire, and we remain friends. Are you through? Hey, wait... I think I made you an honest proposal. Scram, or I'll break you. Come, one moment. You know what she was. A woman you can buy. This is not a place for people like you! - Be careful... - Get lost! Get lost. We don't want no pimps around here! Scram and don't you come back! Bravo. I liked it, Carlo. I didn't accept... what he has said. I didn't agree. Throw me out if you want. No. You're staying with me. This is the plan. Two entries. The stairs go into the office. I know the place like my own pockets. That's the safe. Impossible without Carlo. And the money? I've seen it. We'll move at the end of the month. I'd do it on my own, if I knew the works. You'll be coming with us? Yes. But the guard might recognise me. We'll take care of him. Michele, how come you suddenly... I've had it with being broke. Honesty doesn't pay. What do you think? I don't believe in big hits. But there's such a thing. Guys, if you doubt me, it's useless. Business is business. If we like it, it's a done deal. If not, we'll go on being friends. Think about it. - Good evening. - Hi, Carlo. If need be, you know where to find me. See you later, Carlo. How did it go? Did you find a job? No. - What are you scheming? - A big hit. Millions. How's our friend doing? We're keeping him company. We'll soon go away. - Here are the cops. - Warn Carlo. Stay calm. Give me some light. The Hook is waiting in the car. - Save yourselves! - Come. You, don't move! Block all exits! They are there! Stop, or I shoot! On the terrace. And the dough? Must be in the box. Quickly! Stop! This way! We're done for. Shut up! To the other exit! They're trapped! Go! Quickly! Where're the millions? I'll make you eat this. How come? I was sure, I swear it. Don't you see what it led to? We'll settle this tomorrow. Let's get back home. We didn't meet. You, shut, or I'll wack you. Leave the car, we go by foot. How did it go? Everything went fine for you. The papers you wanted. It stinks for us. Not a dime. I almost got it. Two guys arrested. - And Carlo? - Went to his place. - Are you sure? - I saw him. Great. See you tomorrow. - And me? - Will speak tomorrow. Here, smoke. Scram, beat it. Come! - Hi. - Where did you spend the night? - What happened? - Nobody came? No. Where were you? Help me. Go get the lawyer. You stole something? Why? Tell me the truth. I had to. Nothing else I could do. Then, everything was useless? Are you hurt? No. A scratch. I'll wash it. The cops caught you? Me and The Hook got away. Leave! Go warn the lawyer. Do what I told you! - What's the matter? - Carlo wants you. I'm coming. - Did it go wrong? - Yes. What happened? - Where's dad? - They did a robbery. - The cops caught them? - Yes. Did they get dad? Yes. Carlo and the Crochet ran away. And Michele? Haven't got a clue. Carlo didn't want to steal anymore. Michele made him do it. You should know Michele has never stolen. That's why they shouldn't have trusted him. Don't argue. We'll get your father out. Did they catch them before or after? They've taken my husband! They're arresting Carlo! - No! - Alda! Someone has rat! Where are you taking him? I'll come back. I don't know what it's about. Come on. Carlo, I'm afraid without you. Why? I didn't do anything. We'll be together very quickly. We were so happy! Look, the sun's rising. Don't be sad. Nothing's for ever. And then, bad times only bring us closer, don't they? I love you so much, Carlo! I love you too. Don't despair. Be strong. Courage. Enough. Let's go. Farewell, my love. - Always unlucky, Lauredi! - Why? It seems the hit was done the night before, and they must have got millions. And this ones they got nothing? No. Zilch. They damaged the safe a little, but... that's no big deal repairing it. Know what? I'll pay for the repairs. Of course. I planned this heist. Let go of it. Sorry. Who's the father of this nice family? Lauredi, the owner or Lauredi the white slave trade mastermind? - How much? - No. The papers I got from the safe are priceless. From now on, we're partners. You'll take care of the cash. I'll come up with the ideas. Can I? Alright. Mister Marquedi! I came here to see you. - I've been looking for you for three days in a row. - What is it? Let's put the cards on the table. You called the cops. I? Why should I have? To get Carlo arrested. That wasn't agreed. Why do you worry so much? Nothing happened to you. Then I was right. To get Carlo arrested, you'd have even sent me to prison! Come on! Nothing would have happened to you. - I assure you. - What you did is an infamy! Call it as you wish. The others suspect me. But, if I go down, we'll both go! I'm sorry. Really. But you're too impulsive. On the contrary, we should be friends, you and me. How much money do you owe me? What's my debt got to do with it? It doesn't exist anymore. I'm setting it aside. Happy? Everyone hates me in the borough. Don't blow up things. In two or three days, everything will be forgotten. No, they're capable of everything. Who's "they"? They women, the parents, beggars. Don't mind it. Give them a little money. Or, rather... Listen. This woman I've seen you with the other evening, how about introducing her to me? She could work for you. I'm dating her. Her or someone else... It's money that matters in life! Come, have a coffee. What's the address? Do you know his cell number? No. No problem, you're taking it to them. - I only write his name? - Yes. Don't you put his cap? You're right. I have to unpack everything. Leave dad's biscuits alone. Am I intruding? What do you want? Michele sent me. I came instead of him, he's afraid the cops are looking for him. He's afraid? So much the better! If he doesn't help the others, I'll give him up. If your husband were here, he'd spit you in the face. Michele says you should stay calm. It's for the first expenses. Was it worth destroying so many people for nickels and dimes? Take it back to whoever gave it to you. I'll make my own way out of this. Of course. You're beautiful, and you know the ropes. We've been mean with her. Cut it off! She's a hypocrite. How did it go? Badly. - Did you give her the money? - She threw it to my face. Why do you worry so much? Everybody's turning it on me, and only because of you. What do you mean? Who has? All of them. They've spoken about me? They want to send you to the joint. Who said that? The Hook's wife, the stupidest of them all. What a mess! When are you going to leave here? I'd like to. Alright... I've spoken to someone about you. A connected guy. You know, an agent... a theater one. You could be a singer. That's an opportunity. Wanna try? - Sing? - You've got a nice voice. You'd make a name for yourself. Listen, Michele, my spirits are already low enough, don't play any games on me. Here he is. What's he doing here? He's the boss. He's loaded. Wait for me. Mister Marquedi! The borough's boiling! Keep calm. I told her you were a theater agent. Hi! It's you the agent? No, your friend is a big liar. I'm no agent. But I can find you a good job. Thanks, I already got one. As you wish. Glad to meet you... Idiot! You've got no idea what he's offering. Shut up! Pimp! Here, better go and play, go. Don't get angry. Your friend was kidding. You're beautiful and smart. You'll thank me one day. What do you do? I'm a dancer. It's hard and it pays lousy. You deserve better. What should I do? I've got a friend who's looking for some nice girls for a party. Easy money, and well paid. If you're interested, here's the address. Trust me, and go. You'll find her at this hour. Excuse, there's something I must do. Come. Hello, Clara? The girl I was telling you about, you'll see her pretty soon. Yes, yes like always. Good bye. Come, get in. I was waiting for you. You are...? Oh, yes, come. Marquedi told me about you. You did well coming, there's no one now, we can talk freely. I need girls like you. Let me see you. You're terribly dressed. Have to change everything. Undress, honey. Take this dress off, you'll try a fabulous one. A client left it here. You like it? It's nice, isn't it? Come. Try it. Let's see how it fits. Where do you live? At Casermette. So far? You poor soul, it's ugly! Know what? I'll let you stay in one of my rooms. Or there's someone waiting for you? No, no, don't worry. Nobody worries about me. You'll like it here. Let me see. Perfect. Turn a little. See how beautiful you are. What's with these tears? A grief, maybe? A bad man? You are good with me, too god. But I'm no little girl. I know what you want from me. I don't care. I'm young, I want to live my life. That's all. That's good. You know what you want. Come, dearie. Let's have a drink. We'll be friends, you and I. - Hello, Linuccia. - Hi, milord. And your promises? The trial's nearing, we're waiting for the lawyer. You think money falls from the sky? They'll get it without a lawyer. You don't give a shit. Linuccia, believe me, I'm looking for a loan. We'll see. And Alda? She's starving like the others, because of you. Wait a moment. Pretend you're giving me 5,000 lire, I'll return it afterward. I don't want her to see I got money in my pockets, or she'll rip me off. Here, that's all I could get, but there's a way out. What's that? A dance contest. Alda is a good dancer. You want us to become the kind of dancer Lucia is? If Lucia has problems, that's her fault. It's a serious proposition. Tell Alda to come and speak with me at Chico's bar. Only Alda? Alright, you can come also. See you tomorrow, but don't say anything to the others. - If not, there will be 50 of them. - Bye, Michele. Come on! She's the cute, the little one. I know. If you introduce her to Marquedi, it's a hit. Leave it to me. If you want, go for it. Hello. One, two, three... Your attention, please. We remind you that before entering, you must read the rules. We'll give you same cards and you'll have to fill them up attentively. A lot of passion for dancing around here... No, not passion... Hunger! You dislike my idea? All candidates that will sign the agreement, will be hired, after an approval of our jury, for a foreign countries gig. Come forward, come forward. Come on. Age? I'm 19. Some one will have to sign for you. But I've got no one. That's a pity. It's a nuisance. Don't worry. We'll find a way out. Climb on the platform. Let's see. - Can't you dance? - Yes, I can. Get going, then. How? All alone? Of course. It's a test. Alright. Okay. Enough. Medical check-up. - Tony! - What? Next one. Come in. Here I am, Miss "Tre Venezie". Must I dance? Carlo isn't dead. With a little good will, we could help him. We'd need hundreds of thousands for the lawyers. That's why the marathon. A sacrifice, I know. But you can win a lot, due to the bonuses. Do you see me dancing day and night? It's true, it'd seem impossible. With a 10 minutes break per hour, you can go on dancing, without even noticing it. If you crack up, you can go. And you take a nice sum with you. You see? You can't win without trying. What do you think? Carlo, when he cracked open the safe, didn't he know he might end up in the joint? He knew it very well. But he went for it. And for whom? For you. I was with him. Before going in, he hesitated, like you are now. And then, thinking only at you, his hesitations vanished because he wanted to offer you a better life. And now? He's in jail now. Hello, Carlo. You did you manage to get visiting rights? Thanks to that lawyer. - I'll be out in no time, you'll see. - Yes. - That's what he says. - Really? Yes. Let's not bullshit each other. It will be tough. No, Carlo, you'll see we'll get a good lawyer. A smart one. Who's gone give the money? I'll find it. How? I've thought a lot, these last days. About you and me. Maybe it was a mistake to be together. You're young, beautiful. You can't be with me, 10 days out, and one inside. I should have understood it sooner. I liked you, I loved you. I wanted to help you, and unfortunately, you see where it got me? And now? You'd have to wait 3 or 4 years for me, starving. Better not wait for me. Forget me. Carlo, why do you say that? I love you. I also think about you every day. No, luck was not on our side. When fate's against you, there's nothing you can do. No, Carlo, I won't give you up. I'll work, you'll see. I won't shame you. Carlo... .. trust me. I do trust you, Alda. But think about what I've said. Come on, guys, free music! - Have you seen these freaks? - Let them have fun. So, are you in? I can't dance, I've told you. Moving your feet does it. Would you like making it big time? Dad wouldn't like that at all. I'd think he'll be happy you got him a good lawyer. And you, will you be in? I can't! Dancers are all professionals. They have their own contest. - I'd like you to be my partner. - I? - Yes. - Aren't you afraid? No, with you, no. You're here for the marathon? The lists are closed. - Michele sent me. - Okay. Hey, Alda! Good luck! Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen, we have just begun the most original dance contest ever. A real marathon. 35 couples will fight each other until exhaustion. Let's remind the rules. If a contestant gives up, his partner goes on dancing alone, until he can form another couple. Breaks: 10 minutes every two hours. Don't squeeze me. We're not married. See you in the break. - Easy, don't tire yourself. - Alright. No, only Italian. He thinks he's made it. Did it work with that one? Who are you talking about? You know it very well. Alda. What I want, I get. That goes for me also? - Why not? - But I'm expensive. Nothing's too much for me. You took me to make money, not to spend it. Ladies, gentlemen, remember it's only the first evening. The dancers are still fresh. Come back in a few days, the show will be rougher. You'll see them fight tiredness, sleep, the obsessive and implacable music. Watch closely, a dancer quits. Number 24, Miss Alda. She's got 5 minutes to come back, or she'll be disqualified. You're leaving? What do you want from me? You've seen Marquedi? Don't quit because of him. He isn't the boss. You've got a contract, what do you care? Michele's sending you? Listen, Alda. Marquedi has humiliated me also. He can do nothing against you. I want to help you with the contest. - I can make you win bonuses. - Are you doing it for Carlo? You can't understand, you're not from the borough. You see, when we were kids, we, the borough girls, we were all in love with Carlo. He was our hero. One Christmas evening, we had nothing to start a fire, and he went stealing. Guess what? A doll for each of us, in a toy store. I love him. He's the only one that gave me happiness. Go dancing, or you'll be disqualified. I'll tell him about your help. You can skip that, it doesn't matter anymore. Lucia, you mustn't go there, do you understand me? Yes, madame. You are very beautiful tonight. Go! Number 24 is back in the contest. Well done, bravo. Don't give up, we've only just begun. The audience encourages the dancers, and offers them bonuses. For a samba, number 24. Very well, miss. We are announced the arrival of important figures: newspapermen, film makers, movie producers. Attention! A member of the audience who wants to remain anonymous, is offering 10,000 lire to couple 24, for a hot samba. Alda, you're the 24. The dancers clear away the center of the ring, always following the rhythm of the music. Who stops is lost. Give it, boys! "The king of Portugal!" Break. The first break of the marathon, but not for number 24 who has to recoup 4 minutes dancing alone. We wish the others a refreshing break. See you back in 10 minutes. Aren't you tired? Get some rest. I'd rather do without this break! Don't deteriorate the dresses. they are not yours! How can you dance with a baldie? It's not possible. - Say, have you heard? - What? There's some movie people that's gonna come. Attention! You're gonna see something. Will they test us? There's no water! Silence! That's no manners! - Whose is the shoe? - Mine! Forget it, we won't feel their smell in three days. Watch poor Alda. She's got to dance alone. Ladies and gentlemen, the contest's been going on for seven days and seven nights. This is the most tense moment. Daybreak moments are the worst for our contestants. Cold is right up to their bones, even if you're warm. Sleep's taunting them, but they hang on. Wake up, lazy! Where are those movie people? You're still waiting for them? It's the last day for me. Don't give up, idiot! A typical turn. The first of this contest. Dance, or you'll be disqualified. It really sucks. Come, let's work. His partner must go on, or she'll be also disqualified. I'm exhausted, I can't go on. Courage, Linuccia, you know why we're doing it for, at last. Lean on me, kid, I'll support you. Break! In ten minutes, everyone one back in the ring. Hurry up, come on, get up. The members of the audience who'd like to dance, have the ring at their disposal. Thank you. Linuccia! How do you feel? Give up if you're at the limit. I want to win. Dad is in jail. I've brought you hot coffee. Giorgio, look at the sun. I shouldn't have made you come here. 7 times 8? You're still doing it? You don't stop. You maybe hope becoming a millionaire? Even she's weakening. She'll crack up before tomorrow. In 15 days, we'll be left only 2 or 3. I'll hold on. Give me a tablet. Take care with amphetamines. Take it. What's the matter with you? I'm chilled... to the bones. Drink, it will warm you up. No. I'm afraid my heart won't resist. Heart problems? Same as me. I have a crush on Manuel, Alda's partner. He's cute! Hi, Fanny! The break has ended, everyone in the ring. The break has ended, everyone in the ring! The break has ended. Dancer 18 is missing. I don't see number 18. Number 18 is three minutes late, she'll have to compensate come the next break. Come quickly. It's for you to satisfy them. This one, yes. Very well! No, not this one. She's staying. A pity. No, not this one. The sad and melancholic type. Very cute. I'll take those two. The missing one. You must take her. The one that ran away? Alright. She's going. No, no. Not this one. She's cold. I'll take her, but with this one. I'm sorry, she's staying. - A pity. - When are they leaving? In one month. Same scheme. Good bye, madame. Do we need this one here? As singer! You should take off Lucia's picture. It's not me... Who's running things here? No muddle up, yes?! I'm not kidding. Couple number 5 needs a stimulus. Who wants to offer them a bonus? One thousand lire to couple number 5 for a sprint. That's lame for a stimulus. Show generosity! Courage! A sprint warms you up and energizes you. Too late. She's giving up. Her partner goes on with the lady who was left alone, before the break. Sprint for everybody! Dance! She was sick. I can't go on anymore, I'm getting mad. I thought she really loved me. She's like the others. Capable of everything to have her picture on first page. You're wrong. There's no one better than Alda. She and Linuccia only think at you and at the trial date. Bullshit! That's what they tell inmates to calm them down. Do you hear? Lies! We don't believe your stories anymore. Alda should have stayed home. She's making dough for the lawyers. Better a marathon than something worse. You know what some do to help their husbands? If Alda'd do the same, would you tell me? Let's not speak about it anymore. Prison destroys men. When I get out, I'll know everything. You think I'm in for more than 3 years? Let's hope not. You must have been mad trusting Michele. And the borough? They live on bread and hope. Sometimes hope without bread. Tell Pot that Linuccia is well and says hi. Carlo, listen. I'm going to see Alda. What do I tell her? Nothing. Miss! - Am I late? - No. You're asked for. - How are you? - The worst's gone. It was the beginning. I can hold up more. Have you seen Carlo? Yes. Why doesn't he write? In prison, everything's known. A man that loves you doesn't appreciate. What? The ball, this marathon, this atmosphere, your exhaustion. He's suffering. But where's the bad thing? Here it pays well. Lucia helps me get bonuses every evening. In all, almost 150,000 lire. You alone? No, of course. There's two of us dancing. Listen, I had come to tell you to stop. In the borough, we've gathered a pot. Before coming, I went and saw the lawyers. Good ones, doing miracles. They took everything in advance payment. If they are to plead before the court, we must pay them at least 200,000 more. When? On the 25th, in 15 days. The money will be there. Where's Linuccia? They've begun! I'm late. Don't worry. I love you, Giorgio. I love you too, Linuccia. I have to go. Here, take this. Come on, wake up. Dancer 18 is late. Also late, the lady with number 12... and the gentleman with number 24. - Where were you? - 3 minutes penalty each. Dance with him, if you like him so. Attention! Another bonus for couple 24, a samba bonus. Show us a samba who'll match the generosity of our donor. Come, I want the bonus. Leave him to me! Thief, leave him I said! Stop! Get lost! Take him, Alda! Hold on! Give me a little money. Haven't I? More than you thought. Who paid the hospital? It was mad coming here in this condition. I needed the money. Come sit down. I proposed you to sign the contract. You can make a lot of money. Once the marathon ends, we'll support you. What more do you want? I'm afraid. Why? Come with me to America. You'll do marathons. Your income is assured. It's well paid. You'll meet generous and rich people. When will we be back in Italy? In one year. But you can return sooner. Are you signing? - Hello! - Hi. She's got out of hospital, but doesn't know where to go. It's depressing. She'll sleep with Lucia. Tomorrow we'll see. - Alright. - Okay? Hello? What do you want? Lucia, how are you? Where you asleep? Could we see each other for a moment? The idea! You see me all day long, what's the matter? Lucia... Why are you always so nasty with me? Let me sleep! Alright. Tomorrow. Everything you want. Good evening. Good night. Has the moron waken you? I was not asleep. Leave me alone, get it? Weren't you asleep? A problem? No, just thinking. - Here, take this. - Thanks. He dares bother me at night! Who was it? - Marquedi. - The one with the marathon? - Yes. - What's he like? Some guy! He has just understood he likes me. I'll show him, believe me! He's disgusting. You know your way with men. You've said it. See where it takes you? You're always merry, elegant. Marquedi has to be useful to something. Have you never been in love? Me? Yes, once... Long time ago. Look. Do you like him? Who is he? A man. He's in prison now. Had he listened to me, he wouldn't be there. Do you know what I'm doing? I'm helping the woman who took him away from me. Must be really stupid... And here are the producers! And the directors! Cinema comes to the marathon. A big round of applause. And also for the contestants who've been at it for 552 hours, and are stay capable of a terrific sprint. Courage! Something to electrify you! Dance! Or you'll be disqualified. They are mad. Let's go. They're leaving! They are already leaving! They're not interested in us. Did you think you'd get a job? Hi. Are you angry? I've introduced you to Marquedi. Don't shame me. Explain yourself. What are you here for? Look at the Moon? What do you want from me? What do I want? You've been paid to bring a girl, not for getting engaged to her! I do want I want. If I go to the police... Did you hear that? Don't play smart. We've got long arms, you risk ending up in the joint. Come, Michele. You're leaving? One less. Stop it. You're pregnant. Do you feel sick? Yes, very bad. Are you expecting? Yes. Let's give up, Linuccia. We'll ask for our money tomorrow. We've won enough bonuses. It will suffice. Does Carlo know it? No, not yet. Did you know it when you came here? No. I didn't. I'm even happier I've come and done this sacrifice for Carlo. My child mustn't be born with his father in prison. I'm both so happy, and so frightened, at the same time. I want the trial to start sooner. Where do you think you are? At your place. It's your birthday tomorrow. I've got a present for you. Give it to me. Or have you changed your mind? You're never nice to me. And still... I am with all the others, say it. Marquedi plays romance. In this circumstances, one must keep a cool head, like you and me. When a girl abandons, do you pay her bonuses? You're interested in it? A little. Maybe I've got a cut from one of the dancers. Answer. Of course we're paying them, at the end of the marathon. Oh, yes? Why? Because that's how it is. Courage, Linuccia. One more effort. I must claim my money! I've told Alda. She'll take care of it. Courage. You're sure you have seen him go down? Where has this moron hidden? An advice, find her. He must have taken her home. Let's go. Had I known you were the boss, I wouldn't have come. You know it. What do you want? I want my money. And Linuccia's. Bonuses are paid at the end. But we are giving up. The contest is over for us. But the marathon isn't over. As long as one couple holds, the marathon goes on. For once, do something good. You know why I need this money for. It means nothing for you. For me, it's everything. You haven't understood anything. Do you think I'll do it so you can help your lover? Have you forgotten the way he treated me when I came to see you? As you deserved. Sure. He's in the joint and I'll do my best he stays there. What do you want? Do you want to hit me also? I won't give you not even a lira. You'll get nothing out of me. Understood? The game's not over, remember. You'll pay, you'll pay for everything. For all the bad you've done me. I'll send you also in prison. She's tired. She's fallen asleep, poor soul. Let her rest and watch her. You're right on time. It's nice having remembered my birthday. Nobody ever does. It's nice here. Yes. Look. You like it? How much is it? Not expensive enough for you. Who is it? Michele. Come on, tell me. Alda has escaped. She no longer is at the office. They are looking for her. Better not come at the marathon. Imbeciles! That's what was missing! Alright, go, look for her. Problems? Yes. I must go out for a moment. You're already leaving? Who is it? Lucia, what are you doing here? I've brought you the money for the lawyers. We are in time. Who's this money from? No one. Here we are, miss. This is the courthouse. Are you alright? What time is it? Almost ten. - How much is it? - 270 lire. Miss! She's fainted. What is it? I don't know. A dizzy turn. I'll take her to the hospital. The Court sentences Carlo Sonzosi to 4 years and 2 months in prison, A. Barili, aka "The Gorilla", to 3 years, A. Consiglio, aka "Pot", to 3 ans, F. Spartaco, aka "The Hook", to 2 years and 1 month, with one added year of supervised release and the payment of legal costs. 3 days to appeal. - Linuccia hasn't come. - Where's Alda? I don't know. Let's go. Hasn't she regained consciousness? Once. She talked about the marathon. Pregnant? Yes. But there was nothing we could do. She had a haemorrhage. The heart's weak. Aren't you going to stop this marathon? Measures have already been taken. I must interrogate her. Give her a tonic, so she may talk. You must patience. If the heart holds on, she might have an instant of lucidity. It seems she wants to talk. Carlo... .. is in prison... Where's my baby? Tell him! We will. Who's Carlo? Is he in prison? Where's my baby? Yes, we'll tell him. Carlo what? What's his name? A prisoner's wife, without doubt. Alda, do you hear me? Have you been hit at this marathon? What happened to you? I'm tired. I wanna die. - Die. - Leave her be. If she gets better, I'll let you know. - Nothing to the press. - Understood. I've been in the cell for 15 years... What happened to your arm? Lost in the war, in a bombardment. If you'd have it, you'd be with the others. - It's you, The Hook? - Yes. And you? I'm Lidia. Take a cigarette. - Can I? - Go ahead. Thank you, sergeant. You don't sing anymore. Have we lost our voice? Here, smoke. - I can't take it anymore. - Calm down. Have you read the papers? She's gonna die. If you get angry, it's done for. - The women will take care. - How much longer are we staying here? 2 hours. We'll leave by night. There's a trattoria with lots of cars. We'll do it when a train goes by. Stop this record. The farce has been going on long enough. There's a misunderstanding. - Shut it! - We're disqualified. - We'll lose everything. - Block the exits. We can't stop. Here. Inspector! No organizer. Half-dead dancers. We're too late. This one could give us information. Sergeant, take everything. We'll go through the harbour bars. We're leaving. Who wants something to drink? I do, an orange juice. A Coke. - Have you got any dimes? - I gave it to you. We've been together for twelve hours, you remind me of my late son. I'd like something. I'd like drinking a hot punch. Go fetch one. I feel so sick. Alright. Sergeant, I'll go to the bar. Let's go. Attention, the connection's coming. Thanks. Mario, unlock. Give it, I'll light you. Help! Are we through with this? You're gonna get it! It's enough, I said! Quickly! Where are the cars? - There. - Come. We'll take this one. It's me, Carlo. Wake up, it's me. No... Carlo can't come here. I'm here. Don't you recognize me? Look at me. Carlo? He's so far away... They'll condemn him. I've been acquitted. They've recognized my innocence. What have they done to you!? It's you! Forgive me, I'm so tired. I feel I'm going away for ever. I wanted to help you. But I was no good. I've been acquitted, Alda. It's you who has saved me. They've killed our child. They are so bad! I was so happy with you! Who has hurt you? All... All, except you. Answer me! Look at me! Don't leave me! Who are you? What are you doing here? Who are you? There's nothing that can be done. Go away. Go away! Adieu, Alda. Someone will pay, I swear it. Don't move. Drive on. - Carlo! - Drive on, I said. Stop under the first street lamp. He has signaled. Let's hope Marquedi is with them. - And Marquedi? - He's to join us with his car. - Everyone here? - Except Fanny. She ran away, she must have boozed. If I find her, I'll kill her. I'll take your car. Is it going to take long? I can't stop here. Speak! Who killed Alda? I don't know anything. I've read it in the papers. It was an accident! Speak if you wanna live. Where's my daughter? I don't know anything. My daughter? Speak or I'll choke you! Take this lamp away! Yes, if you tell me about this transatlantic. I'll dance. - Where? - In America. In America, hear, hear! Has an agent come from there to give you the job? He doubts it, the sweetie! I'm leaving tonight. Why not introduce me to this agent? Why do you blame me? I'm same as you. Who too Alda to the marathon? She went to help you. You know why we've escaped? Speak, or you'll pay for all of them. Tell us what you know! I'm going over the Atlantic. And you'll dance alone? No, with the corps de ballet. Other girls. I'm the most beautiful. Who hired you? - Stop! - Who selected you? Him. I'm his victim. Did he kill Alda? Where's my daughter? Who knows? Where did it happen? At the marathon. In America, I'll get married. And there you can get a divorce. But where's this agent? If his not at the marathon, he's at his place. Or his office. What if we don't find him? Answer! Where are they waiting for you? In the harbour. Northern quay. We leave by ship. You're leaving? Have you come to an agreement with the French? Do you mind? But you haven't got it. I really love you. I don't. Look, it's for you. Look if you doubt it. It's for you! I spent the night with you for money. You were there to grab. So you're dumping me. I want fresh air. Here's too queer. The marathon amuses me. I thought you were intelligent. You're as dumb as the others. You bought the marathon in America stuff? Nobody comes back from this voyage. Or, then, nobody will recognize them anymore. Why would they be paid so much? You make me puke! More than before! That's why Alda... Carlo's in! Carlo? Alda's. He has escaped. Come. That way. They ran that way. Do you know where he went? Let it go. He's despicable. Alda's dead and Linuccia has disappeared. Tell me where Linuccia is. What have they done to her, speak? I thought she was at home. She isn't. Ten women are leaving tonight. Linuccia also, maybe. - Where are they? - The North quay. With Marquedi. Everything's alright? - The French is here? - No. No? He should be. How come? Why don't we have a passport? Who'd give you one? Why shouldn't they? Because we're cursed. They are not giving the signals. Maybe... To the truck. Everybody, get out! Hands up. You too. Linuccia's not here. Move! Come on, move it! At the bridge do as agreed. Where are we going? Where're you taking me? If it's money you want, I'll give it to you. I'm rich. Shut up, scum. You'll speak in front of entire the borough. The borough? Don't worry. We'll get you a nice house 6 feet under. Missing for good. Don't move. They left for the bridge, they've kidnapped me, at least 5 of them. To the bridge, quickly. Come with us. Let the bridge down. Stop! - Hands up. And the others? - What others? Silence! Keep cool! Do you know why we hate you so much? We all have scores to settle. You'll pay for those that have dishonored our women. Kill them, Carlo! Kill! Death! You're one of the five inmates who escaped during transfer? Cards on the table, answer me. What can I tell you? You know it all. Why escape? You only have 3 years to make. For some fresh air. And Linuccia, where's she? Carlo! Guys, you must believe me! We wanted no harm. Not to her, nor to Alda. Lucia, you've come saying hello to your Michele? Lucia, for the sake of our past love, tell them I did nothing, that I'm not mixed in it. Come on! Should have thought about it before. She gave the money for the lawyers. Alda should have brought it. But he refused. Say how you got him. As you taught me. You were sending these women to do what? You've explained me. You thought you were going to do marathons? He had sold you like animals. I'd have been sold also had he not told me the truth. Because he liked me, and wanted to keep me here. He killed Alda. I had told you. It's him that killed her! Speak, Clara. It's false! She was tired. She died of exhaustion. - Of weakness. - Why run? Speak the truth. It's your fault. Who's is the marathon idea? Who was in white slave trade? Her! Her and him. I know it. He got rich from this business. It's 20 he's been doing it. I know it! These women you're talking about, I never knew them. Something else. He planned the hit so that he could send you in the joint. And I should spare you? I loved this woman. But loving, it's something way beyond you. You're not a man. You're a worm. You've abused hundreds of women. You've brought us down snitching to the cops. You're respectable. It's us the criminals. We're thieves, yes! Tell us what you are. What's your trade? If you kill me, you're up for 30 years. Is that woman worth them? So, you don't know those in the truck? Otherwise I'd have told you. The Gorilla! And dad, where's he? You have no right to judge us. Turn us to the police! Don't do it! An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth! You're condemning yourself, get out of there! - Don't listen to him. - They're mad. Don't listen to him! 30 years in prison! Don't worry. It's my business. I'll be the only one paying for it. I wanted you to witness. For the first time, I kill a man. I'm not an assassin. You must know why I became one. He destroyed my life, I'll destroy his. Michele is a bastard. He ratted. Stop. Hands up. - Dad! - My Linuccia! No handcuffs. You've got nothing more to do outside. Take them away. Good bye, Linuccia. Courage, Carlo. Three years are quickly gone.
