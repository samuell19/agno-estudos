In Amsterdam, I dreamt I saw my mother again. She was just as glad to see me as I was to see her. Same beautiful pale blue eyes. Everything would've turned out better if she had lived. As it was, she died when I was a kid. And when I lost her... I lost sight of any landmark that might've led me some place happier. You see, her death was my fault. Everybody used to tell me that it wasn't. That it was a terrible accident. Which is all perfectly true. And I don't believe a word of it. It was my fault. Just like everything that's happened since. The painting. The painting. All my fault. I lost something that should have been immortal. I didn't mean to do it. Because what I've done cannot be undone. It doesn't matter that I'm going to die. But for all time, for as long as history is written, that painting will be remembered and mourned. As best we can tell, he made his own way back to his mother's apartment from the museum. He waited there for her all night to come back and when she didn't, he rang the emergency number they were showing on TV. When they realized his age, they alerted us. I don't know if you're aware but Theo's father left the family about six months ago. I wasn't aware. My son and Theo were friends in elementary school. To my knowledge, they haven't seen much of each other for a while. I'm afraid I don't quite understand. Uh, right now, he is a minor child in need of temporary emergency care. When we asked Theo if he could think of anyone that might be able to help for a while, he suggested you. Come in, come in. I'm afraid Andy isn't up yet. You can rest here if you like. Let's get you squared away. Oh, here we are. You'll be... You'll be feeling awfully rough. Hell of a thing to happen. Good Lord. In the circumstances, I wouldn't see the harm in pouring you what my father used to call a minor nip, - if you should want some. - Chance. Which of course you don't. Quite unsuitable. We're perfectly happy to have you, Theo. I hope you'll make yourself as comfortable as you can. What's happening? Shh. That's Theo. His mom passed away. Someone to see you, Theo. Wow. Disturbing. Yeah. No, apparently no one has any idea where he is. He wasn't paying child support. He left debts. He more or less flew town without a word. I don't think we had a choice. We couldn't very well turn the boy away. No. Just for a few weeks. Do you sail, Theo? No, sir. That's a pity. Andy had the most outstanding time at his sailing camp up in Maine last year. They were the worst two weeks of my life. Nonsense. You lack confidence. That's all. Would you like me to ask Etta to make you something else to eat, Theo? I'm not hungry. Thank you. Where's his dad? Good question. Oh, my God! Try this on, Theo. It's an old one of Platt's. It's so cold outside. Outside? I think you should go back to school next week. The sooner we get back to a normal routine the better. Keeping busy is the only thing for it. Perhaps you could go this afternoon? To your apartment. I could come with you. I meant to clean up while I was waiting for her. You get what you need. I'll tidy this up. Just your school things. The rest can wait. Also, basketball practice has been moved to 4:00 on Thursday. Tickets for next week's lacrosse final are available in the admissions office. Go Vikings! - Hey, Tom. - Hey. Uh... I heard and all. Yeah. Yeah, tough luck. That really bites. The only reason we were at the museum was because my mom was bringing me in to see the principal. About the cigarettes. Yeah. My mom blew up over that shit, too. So, uh, I gotta go. Later. Where are you going? - Creep-io! - Loser! I'm going to go swimming every day. You can't swim by yourself. You're not allowed. Everyone's going to swim. The cure for anything is salt water. Greatest gift my father ever gave me was the sea. The love for it. The feel. What's he going to do while we're away? Who's the artist I like, Samantha? With the grand skies? Maxfield Parrish. Maxfield Parrish, that's the one. Great towering clouds. When I was a boy on the water, skies just like that. Magical. Red and orange sunsets. Arcadian. Oh. Best to leave that to Esperenza, Theo. She's used to doing it. And the same with your dishes. Oh. That is a lovely ring. Is it a family thing? Your mother's side? Yes. Lovely. Carnelian. The intaglio. And the engraving on the inside says, "Blackwell." You should keep it somewhere safe. I thought these might help. If you take one at night, it'll keep you from feeling scared. It's perfectly understandable. We all feel afraid sometimes. We're just trying to build up a general picture. Little bits of the puzzle. Now, how long would you say you were in the museum before the first explosion? About an hour. Look at the map. Where were you when it happened? Which room were you in? The last one before the gift shop. 32. But your mother wasn't with you? No. She wanted to go back and see a painting again. Which painting? The Anatomy Lesson. It's a Rembrandt. Why didn't you go with her? Theo? I said I'd meet her in the gift shop. What do you remember about the incident? Move! Get out! Like, did you smell anything before it happened? I don't remember. Did you see anything unusual? I don't remember. Anything at all? Where were you when the blast happened? Here? Or here? I don't know. I know all these rooms look alike but maybe if you could remember where you were, we can start to piece this thing together. I'm not sure I see the point in putting him through all of this. Theo hit his head. He has some memory impairment. Nobody seems to have thought to ask if he was hurt or not. Is that true? All right. Afterwards, when you came round, did you see people? Yes. What were they doing? They were dead. You told Beeman the cigarettes were mine. I was just standing next to you! Jesus. Get up! Right. Okay. Are you absolutely sure you wanna do that? Do what? Your rook is in danger, but I would suggest you take a look at your queen. Sorry things are so fucked up. She was awfully nice. Excuse me, I, um... He told me to bring it here. I'm Hobie. Come in. Is that him? The man who gave you the ring? Yes. His name was Welty Blackwell. He was my business partner. Oh, he was the business, really. Handled the clients and sales. You... You said he gave it to you? You mean in the gallery? After... I'm glad he wasn't alone. He would've hated that. You're the boy, aren't you? Whose mother was killed there? Have you eaten? You like the family you're staying with? The Barbours? It was in the papers. About her taking you in, I mean. Orphan's plight type thing. I've done some work for her family in the past. What's your favorite subject in school? English, I guess. You have a favorite author? Tolkien. Edgar Allan Poe. My dad says he's second-rate though. He says he's the Vincent Price of American letters. I don't think that's fair though. No, I don't either. And where is he in all this then? Your father? Oh, I don't know. He ditched us. Good riddance. He could be okay sometimes, I guess. He used to be an actor. And when we watched movies, he used to tell me how they did the special effects and all. But he drank. Like sometimes when he picked me up from school and... Anyway, he's gone now. Well, you've pitched up with an interesting family anyway. Now all that remains is a handful of paintings. The Goldfinch is one of them. It had to live its whole life like that? Trapped? Is she here? Pippa? This is Theo. He wants to say hello. Not too long, pigeon. You need to rest. I know you. Are we friends? Sorry. I've forgotten things. I didn't remember my room when I came home. What's your favorite piece of music? Beethoven. You look like somebody who listens to Beethoven. Is that what you wanna do? Be a musician? I'm not supposed to listen to music, 'cause of my head. It's horrible. What Beethoven do you like? I've got some Glenn Gould. It's my favorite. It's medicine. I think it's morphine. - You get tired during the day? - Yeah. I didn't use to. Me neither. Now, I can't stay awake. I'm sorry. I know it's rude, but would you mind if I just close my eyes for a bit? You can listen to some music, if you like. You like it? John Singleton Copley. A great Colonial portrait painter. It was my grandmother's. She loved it, too. Is this option two or three? - Three. - Okay. And now, how about if this is choice five? Or choice six? Six. Why can't she listen to music? She can, sometimes. It just tends to upset her. She thinks she has to practice, prepare a piece for school. They say that she could play on some amateur level one day, but so many changes. Her aunt is taking her to Texas. I thought she lived here. Well, she did. Welty was her uncle and her legal guardian, after her mother died. But now, Margaret is Pippa's nearest relative. Blood, anyway. And she thinks she'd be better off with her. What's she like? She seemed nice, I guess. She said she's got horses and a swimming pool. I don't ride. Do you? No. My mom did. She used to have horses growing up in Kansas. There was this one, used to get so lonely, he would come and put his head through the window just to see what was going on. Is your mother dead too? Yes. Did yours get sick? No. Will you stay with the family you're with? No. They're all going away for the summer. Then what? I don't know. I wish you weren't going. Do you remember seeing me? When? Right before. I remember you. I was there. I was there. You should get some rest, pigeon. And I, uh... I told Theo I'd show him the workshop. You like old things. Must be interesting for you at the Barbours' then. The Chippendale? Queen Anne? It's nicer here. You can see how they're made. At the Barbours', they all kind of look like stuffed animals. You can help me sort through these cherrywood veneers. Looking to match the case for this clock here. Theo, you remember Platt. Who do I have to blow to get a cup of coffee around this place? Go back to your room. Chance, just... No. Not this time. Go back to your room. Now! Something happened at school. Something bad. Has he been expelled? No one will talk about it. Mother loves Platt the best. Daddy loves Kitsey best. Mother loves Platt. She loves Toddy a lot, too. I can't tell. Well, one way is to check the wear. If it's too even, like here, then it's reproduction. Antiques always wear asymmetrically. Another thing, here, this. It's machine-cut. You feel it? - Hmm. - But here, hand-planed. So this one is fake. Well, no. It's only fake if you try to pass it off as an original. This is a reproduction and not a very good one. There are things you can do to help the reimagining. Period wood, acid, gold size, lampblack. You can rust old nails in salt water. You'll get a feel for it. The new one's flat. It's dead. But this one... That glow. That's hundreds of years of being touched, used. That's life. What do you know about Texas? You can't walk anywhere and they have the death penalty. But it'll be better for her there. The climate is good for convalescents. She should go to the planetarium. Although it's inferior to the Hayden. Do you wanna go get a burger? I thought you were watching your weight, so you'd fit into your prom dress. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh! Well, I've been making a corsage for your dress and it goes a little something like this! Theo... I have a proposal for you. Would you like to come to Maine with us this year? Yes! Please! That would be... Yes, please. Good. We'll see how you like sailing. You think it's going to be fun, but you'll hate it. How come they decided to ask me? Don't be a dunce. They've grown quite fond of you. I think they might make a family announcement in Maine. Announcement? I think they might wanna keep ya. Andy says we'll be sick. He has to carry a baggie on board just to throw up in. I'm afraid I'm the same way. You might just discover you wanna be a sailor or a marine biologist. You never know what's going to decide your future. I got deck shoes, like you said. And I got a sweater. Theo... I have a surprise for you. Hey, buddy. Long time no see. Hi. I'm Xandra. With an "X." So we just got into LaGuardia about two hours ago. I'm out in Las Vegas now and, uh... Well, things are pretty different for me. Son, we're straight off the plane. And, uh, well, we wanted to see you straight away, of course, but also need the key to the apartment. Yeah, we couldn't get in there. We tried already. Yeah, I'm here to start taking care of stuff. You should be proud of your pops. Fifty-one days sober. Did it all on his own. Detoxed on the sofa, basket of Easter candy and Valium. Because I couldn't take it. My mom's the kind of lush who would throw up in her own glass and then drink it anyway. I guess I should have called, but... Well, I figured it was easier just to come and get you. Get me? You got a nice little place here. No, it's more hers than mine. What do you got there? A picture. No, I told ya. Don't haul a lot of junk, all right? You know, the movers will bring most of it. You know, your mother wasn't so easy to get along with. But there's two sides to every marriage, you know? And she sure could hold a grudge. But God knows she didn't deserve... "Desert End Road." It's like you're moving to some mining colony on Jupiter. I wonder if your school will be one those places you read about with gangs, metal detectors. Okay. We're off. Have a good trip, all of you. Goodbye, Theo. You were an awfully good guest. Hey, wake up, buddy. Come on, you're holding up the line. Jeez, he's as white as a sheet. Why don't you give him one of those? You know? Here, this'll help. Shoes. What is that? That's her dog. Popper, you get back here. He stayed by himself? Come here! He's got a water fountain. Grab these other bags, will you? Pop! Would you... Larry, get the dog. Popper! Popper! Jesus, Xan, he's shit all over the floor! You don't think I can see that, Larry? Popper, come here. Damn it, I stepped in it. I thought he'd stopped? Hmm? Oh. That's just a beer. He doesn't touch the hard stuff anymore. Take the trash out, will you? Where does it go? There's a house down the street with a dumpster outside. Just stick it in there. Won't they mind? Who? We're the only ones here. I wear bespoke suits. I swim twice a week. I socialize with people I can't stand. I'm relaxed... personable. I don't indulge in self-pity. It's true what I read. We're so accustomed to disguise ourselves to others, that in the end, we become disguised to ourselves. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. - Yes. - Really? No, but it's so beautiful. How would you know? Most people wouldn't. I've seen pieces he's worked on that I could've sworn were completely genuine. This is genuine Connecticut Queen Anne. But the pediment and the legs were damaged, so the finials and the legs were salvaged from a different piece. What? These? Mmm-hmm. You feel that? Yeah. Wow. And... here. You feel that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What are we looking at? Oh, come and see what Hobie made, Everett. Oh, I didn't make it. I just patched the poor thing up. Not worth much now, of course, but maybe we can find a home for it. What do you think, Pip? Shall we take it? It's bigger than our bedroom. I'm gonna take these two to lunch and then on to the airport. What? Can't you come with us? Oh. No, no, I can't. I have a client meeting, so... You're such a businessman these days. Well, one of us has to be. All right, let's go. Yes. Uh, well, it was so lovely to see you again. It was great to finally meet you, Theo. If you're ever in London, come and stay with us. She was exaggerating about the size of the flat sort of. I can recommend the poularde. That's fine. Thank you. - Thank you. - Very good, sir. This is a pleasant surprise, Mr. Reeve. Lucius, please. Are you looking for another piece to buy? I want to talk about the piece you've already sold me. The Affleck? - It is beautiful, isn't it? - Yes. Except that it isn't, is it? Thomas Affleck, I mean. The phoenix ornament is. I'm fairly certain about that. But the rest of the chest is not. Antique but unremarkable. Mr. Reeve, I can assure you that if there's been a mistake... Oh, but there has been, Mr. Decker. You sold a fake to someone who can tell the difference. To be honest, I am still quite new at all this and I am certainly not an expert at Philadelphia Chippendale. Here's the problem. I know exactly who put the little Frankenstein's monster together that you sold me. Your partner. My partner had nothing to do with this. Oh, I think he did. I've seen his handiwork before. "Changelings." That's what he calls 'em, isn't it? A pair of finials from here, a set of legs from there. Just enough of a genuinely collectable piece to fool the buyer, and voilà. I'm happy to buy the piece back from you, Mr. Reeve. At a premium. I don't see what else I... - I know you. - What? I've been in this business for a long time. We all know poor Hobie was going under, swimming in debt. Then along you come, the wunderkind. The knowledgeable, charming young salesman. Suddenly the business is thriving. But I know you, Mr. Decker. I know all about you. Theo? It's Platt. Platt Barbour. Platt. Good Lord. Long time. How are you? How's Andy? You know how Daddy had... They used to call it "problems with his nerves." Bipolar. I didn't know. He was always very kind with me. Yeah. A few years back, he came off his medication. You know how he loved sailing. He decided to go out off the Northeast Harbor. I went with him. Andy came too, just in case Daddy got storm giddy, you know? Of course, Andy didn't wanna go. He always hated the water. Anyway, the wind blew up and we were trying to reef the mainsail and Daddy started just... shouting all this poetic bullshit. Next thing, he's overboard and we're trying to haul him back in. And we get broadsided. This big wave just... And they both went. Andy hadn't tied his jacket on properly. He's always such a fucking klutz. God, Platt. Do something for me? She's back here. We're very informal now. Mom? I've got a guest for you. Mrs. Barbour? Theo. I can't believe it. So handsome. Isn't he, Platt? Hmm? Yeah. Now, you must tell me, what have you been doing with your life? Uh... Dealing antiques. Antiques. How marvelous, Theo. American furniture mostly. You should come by. You know how I love old things. When you were a child, I used to catch you studying my paintings. You'd always go straight to the very best ones. The Peale, the Lane, the Copley. I used to think, "Oh! A kindred spirit." Mrs. Barbour... I didn't know about Andy. - Hmm. - I can't believe it. I am so sorry. I don't need to tell you about loss. You were always such a good friend to him. Thick as thieves, the pair of you. Your funny little games. So, do you see any of your old school crowd? No, not really. I see a little bit of Tom Cable, now and then. Really? Sees my sister, on occasion. Don't exaggerate, platypus. I ran into him a couple of times. Oh. So you really are here. I didn't believe it when Platt rang to say you were visiting. It's great to see you, Theo. I'm sorry, this is just so weird. You must have been seven or eight the last time I saw you. A long time ago. I'm so glad you came back to us. Just like old times. Hmm? The lowboy goes all the way back to Salem. 1760s. My grandmother's house, I remember, when I was a child, oh, would take my breath away. You know, I'm amazed you came back to us. I always thought you'd hate us. We were so horrible to you, Toddy and I. You were only little. I know. And look at us now. Almost exactly like people. Well, if we're forgiven, make sure you come back again. Dear Pippa... How are you? I've been thinking about you. I hope things are wonderful for you in Texas. I have to say... I sort of hate it here. Do you remember your mother? Yes. What do you remember? She had dark hair and she was really pretty. She laughed a lot. And she liked galleries. Is that why you were there? Do you remember seeing me? "However mean your life is, meet it and live it. It is not so bad as you are. Love your life, poor as it is." And what do we think about Thoreau's anti-commerce stance? I think it's stupid. I mean, if everybody just dropped out and moped around in the woods, what kind of society would we have? It's irresponsible. Right. If it was just people like him, we wouldn't have stores, or television, or roads. - Uh... - Twat. Right. But he might be arguing the opposite of that. Does anyone have a differing opinion? Ha! Harry Potter. Fuck you. Where's your snowboard? Huh? Your T-shirt. There's not much boarding in the desert. No. I don't know how to snowboard. I just hate the sun. Theo. Boris. Where are you from? Russia, Australia, Poland, New Zealand, Texas, Alaska, Canada. Sweden. Originally from Ukraine. - Jesus. - Yeah, we travel. My father digs mines. People hate us everywhere we go because the company promise they won't fuck up the environment, then they fuck up the environment. Ha! But I figure here who cares? - You want to get drink? - What? Drink. I have beer at my house. Uh... Okay. What are you doing? Told you. Hate the sun. No. Do you have any neighbors? All the houses around mine are empty. Same. They built this shit way too far out. Now desert is reclaiming. Ha! Desert and the banks. You want vodka? No, thanks. My dad drinks it all the time. So much, he can't feel his feet. Literally. It's got a name. Well, my... My dad says he's stopped drinking. Sure. You want food? I've got bread, sugar. No, thanks. Is there anyone here? No. My dad won't be back tonight. It's just the two of you? Yes. My mother is dead. Mine, too. Mine was alkie. Got drunk and fell out of window. Mine got killed in a bombing. Yeah. Life, eh? What's this? Uh... Vitamins. Xandra said she got them from this bodybuilder guy. Vitamins? That's not "V" for vitamin, Potter. It's Vicodin. Can get you high. You think she sells? Her? No. She manages a bar on the Strip. Oh! Then she can't be selling drugs. I thought you were from New York? God, she's hot. Would you mind? If me and her... Ugh. You don't like her? No. I think my dad was seeing her when my mom was still alive. He used to say he was going on all these work trips, but I think he was coming here. So? That's on him. Don't blame her. Or the little dog here. What's he called? Popper. - What are you... - Hey. Good boy. That cost $20. It would've cost $20. Oh, look at that. Cute fella. You can put him down. Go ahead. - Stay. - What's your name, kid? Theodore Decker. Another New Yorker, right? Yes, sir. Pleased to meet you. I'm Naaman Silver. Is your dad home? No, sir. "Sir." Nice manners. Do you know when he'll be back? No, sir. Would you like to come in and wait? You're a good kid, Theo. I won't, thank you, because I don't really like to bother a man when he's home. Just tell him I called. And you take care. God bless. Yes! There you go! You see, that's what you get when you exercise discipline. You gotta approach it like an investor. That's me. Pure Scorpio. You believe that stuff? Half the sports books in Vegas have an astrologer on speed dial. You look for the edge where you can. This year, 53% on what? A thousand plays? That's a good year. That's a damn good year. This fucking game, baby. I wanna open up a savings account for you, okay? I put 10,000 aside, so... You don't have to do that. I know I don't have to do that. I know that. I want to. Just give me your Social Security number, when you've got a minute, and I'll open it up for you. It's just, you know... I'm glad you're here, kiddo. You and your mom... You know, you two were always so close. I'm glad you've given me a second chance. There... There you go! Are you seeing this? You're bringing me luck already. This is unbelievable! We got two more games today. We gotta pace ourselves. This is great. Oh, man. We gotta keep that dog out of the house, too. The dog is bad luck. Help me with that, okay? Is there any more ice cream? Whoo! We should trip together. Drop acid. That girl, the thin one in civics? Kayley. She says her mother's boyfriend can get some. Have you done it before? Once. It was fantastic. What does it... Shh! My dad, he'll kill the dog. Hurry. Popper. Come here. Very exciting. If you ever go to Ukraine, people will treat you as big star. Yeah? You didn't tell me your father was in movies, Potter. I mean, it was only one or two, you know. It was mostly, you know, TV work. Hey, listen, Theo, I'm gonna take Xandra to the MGM Grand for Thanksgiving dinner. You wanna come? We thought we might just do our own thing, Dad. We'll probably go to Boris' house for dinner. But I guess I could come with you guys, if that's what you'd rather? The reservation's been made already, so... Well, I'll let you two work it out. Boris, do you like cop movies? - Sure. - Yeah? I made one with Mickey Rourke. You wanna see it? - For real, man? - For real. This was delicious. Thank you. Mickey hated me, by the way. I don't know what the problem was, 'cause I thought he was pretty cool. But, you know, the guy was just threatened by me, for whatever reason. I mean, we even worked out together a couple of times. You want me to change the reservation or not? I never said I didn't want you to come. I never said you did. Got it. What are you two really gonna do anyway? We'll probably just watch TV here. Do you want me to bring you those cocktail sausages and the hot wings that you like? Great. Cool. I'll hook you up. But you stay outta my cigarettes. "Every man, every woman... ...carries one true home." English! In English, you fucker! Oh! Fuck! Oh, my fucking mouth. My wife, Dawn, and our kids, Sebastian and Casey. Ha! Did you hear that? What? The man talking? He just wished happy holiday to his kids, Bastard and Casey. Don't be stupid. That's what he said. That's hard, eh? Casey's okay. But calling your son Bastard on TV... - That's not what he said. - Then what did he say? - How the fuck should I know? - Then why argue? Americans always call their kids stupid fucking names like Apple, and Blanket, and Bear, and shit. Families enjoying the first skate of the season in New York City. You and your mother go there? No. It was for tourists. What did you do? Nothing. We just... She made turkey. We sang songs. Can't we just swallow them? It hits harder this way. How will we know when it starts working? My dad killed a man. In mine, in New Guinea. Bullshit. No. It's true. He did it with a... What do you call it? - Pipe wrench. - Hmm. Tried to make it look like loose rocks had fall on him. We had to leave right after. Now you. A secret. I dream about my mom. I dream somebody tells me where she's living. It's like some old slum building across town. And I run there and I run up the stairs, but she's gone. She's always gone. It's not secret. She won't see me because it was my fault. She was taking me to see the principal because they'd said I'd been smoking. And it was raining, and we were early and that's why we went into the museum. It was my fault she died. And now she won't see me. Swim, Potter. Where am I? Where? Pippa! Where is she? I haven't seen you for so long. Emile. You should stay still. Not here. Don't leave it here. Not here. Don't leave it here. Take it. Take it. They mustn't see it. They'll take it. They took all the light bulbs. They... That? You mean that? It's okay. Here. Take it with you. Promise! Promise you'll take it. Huh. I have to find my mother. Hobart and Blackwell. Ring the green bell. Clear on the side! It's just me, Potter. Potter. Sleep. Sleep, Potter. Theo, you got a minute? Sure. What's up? You know I said I'd had a good year? Well, I'm looking to make some big changes. A buddy of mine is opening up a restaurant. Wow. That's great. Yeah. It's a great opportunity. But, you know, it's just, well, restaurant taxes, liquor license taxes. It's a big initial outlay. Oh. Well, if you need the money from the savings account, you can... Right. No, I, uh... Right. I appreciate that, pal. I do. But what I need you to do is, I need you to call this guy Bracegirdle, your mom's attorney. Um... There you go. I've written everything out. You tell him that I'm sending you to a private school and you need this amount transferred to this account. $65,000? As long as the money's being used for your benefit, it's legal, all right? And this restaurant, it'll be for all of our benefits. Thing is, if we angle this right? You know, we could save, like, 30,000. But why... Theo, I don't have time for this right now. I need you to make this call because the offices will close back East. And if you need to sign documents, you tell him to fax to this number, okay? But why do I have to do it? I mean, it... Hey. You're gonna do this, all right? You've got to. I'm in a real fucking tight spot here. Do you understand that? You got it? Just a temporary thing. But I need the money now! I mean, 'cause this opportunity... Hey. This opportunity could go away, if I don't get on it right now. Stop! Stop with the crying. Just what's on the page. Bracegirdle and Wise. Can I speak to Mr. Bracegirdle, please? This is Theodore Decker. Please hold. Theodore, I'm glad you've phoned. I've had no way of getting in touch with you directly. I wanna go to private school. Did my mother leave me some money? Not exactly. But you do have a 529 which can be used for your education. So, if I asked you to send me $65,000? I'm afraid the funds can only be released directly to the school of your choice. It was set up by your mother to ensure it could only be used for your education. I don't know if I should tell you this, but an unauthorized person has twice tried to make a large withdrawal on the account. Someone with access to your Social Security number, purporting to be your attorney out there. Do you know anything about that? No, I don't. Thank you anyway. God damn it! No! Fuck! God! Fuck! No! No! No! Fuck! He told me you had fortune. My dad? You think if I had a fortune I wouldn't have told you? I don't know. There are lots of things you don't tell me. But that's okay. I know what will make you feel better. Believe me, Potter. This is going to be one of the great nights of your life. It's like a movie. It's all flat and black and white. Would be nice if we could've had color though. Maybe if you paid more. Shit. No one was supposed to be here. Act normal. They've got sparks coming out of their mouths. Normal. Normal. You're still in your work uniform. Theo... your dad's had a car accident. It was about two hours ago. His blood alcohol was .39. He was driving west into the desert, like he was leaving. Right. Right. So, when's he coming back? No, Theo. What I'm saying is is that he's dead. He's dead. He's dead. What are you doing? I didn't think you could see me. You're too young to drink. Apologies. What's wrong with you? What is wrong with you? You can't cry? Your father is dead. Your own father. Oh, you think it's funny? Yeah, well, let me tell you something. You might not have had a lot of time for your dad, but you are his kid... through and through. They've gone. And she's out cold. - What are you doing? - I'm looking for money. I'm leaving before people start showing up. - Come with me. - Where? - New York. - What? I can't stay here with her. Because of what she said? She's a mess, Potter. I feel sorry for her. Don't. We should plan this. Crazy to go tonight. I can't stay here! She'll put me in a home. You understand that? Look, I'm a minor. I've got no family, no friends out here. We have to go. Now. What about Popchik? We'll stop at yours, grab your things, and then go to the bus station. I can't leave now. Give me more time. What? I don't have time. They'll come for me. - Just one day. - Why? Because I... Because what? There's something important I have to tell you. Boris, what? What do you have to tell me? You shouldn't go. It's a mistake. I have to go. Now, are you coming or not? You go ahead. I'll follow. One or two days. You have to come. Promise me. We'll go to Brighton Beach. That's where all of the Russians hang out. And we can go to school together. Potter. And... Good luck. Look after Popchik. I hope this will do. It's Welty's old room. Please don't make me go. You need to get out of those wet things and get some rest. We'll talk when you're feeling better. And no one's gonna make you go. You can stay as long as you like. Both of you. I'm not going to drag you there again but you have to decide. Chinois china or Birds of the Nile? Birds of the Nile. Oh, ow. Oh. Theo. It wasn't quite as romantic as I hoped it would be. They're beautiful. What? No, nothing. They're gorgeous. It's just, do you think they'll be quite right for the actual day? No. Emeralds, I adore them, but they're not really my stone. Mother can't wear green either. Whatever you think. Oh. Darling, I've hurt your feelings, haven't I? Look, I will wear them. - You really don't... - I want to. Kitsey said no speeches today, so this is a toast. To my best friend and her husband-to-be. Aw. To Kitsey and Theo. Cheers. I hope you don't already have this. No. You'll never ever believe this, but I saw this show in Boston when I was in college. Is that that boy? Longstreet? Forrest Longstreet. He was in Andy's class, wasn't he? That's right. He didn't invite Andy to a birthday party, I remember. I don't think Andy would've wanted to go. Perhaps not. You knew him better than I did. I don't think I ever saw him for... what he was. I think I was always trying to make him into someone else. After he'd gone... I thought everything would be broken forever. And then you came back. And I thought I'd never be quite so happy ever again. I hope you don't mind if I speak from the heart, but I always did think of you as one of my own. I know this must have been distressing for you. So I'd like to offer you some compensation. Say, an additional 10,000? I know you were there. Room 32. I know you were there and I know what else was in that room. I don't know what you're talking about. The Metropolitan Museum, the day of the bombing. I don't wanna talk about that. My mother died in that explosion. I know she did. Welton Blackwell died too, in room 32. You know, if your partner hadn't gone around telling half the town how you turned up at his door with Welty's ring, I might never have made the connection. What connection? The connection between you and the painting. The painting you brought to Mr. Hobart, who subsequently made you his ward. - I'm not his... - Or whatever you are to him. The painting you two have been farming out, using it to raise money. This painting. Fabritius' The Goldfinch. Destroyed in a mindless terrorist attack on a New York museum. Oh, poor, brave little bird. Lost forever. You've been irresponsible enough, letting those street thugs handle something so delicate. What I'm suggesting is you sell it to me for, say, half a million dollars. Otherwise, I'm sure the police would be quite interested... What the fuck does this have to do with me? All right. The FBI received a tip that a criminal gang in Miami was using the painting as collateral in a drug deal. But that proves that it didn't burn in the explosion, wouldn't you say? I would advise you to think about my offer. I am quite prepared to go to the FBI. Be my guest. Whenever you'd like to talk about the other matter, call me. Kitsey's not here, Theo. I thought she'd be back from work by now. She's not answering her phone. I don't know when she'll be back. Okay. Can I wait for her here, please? I think you better come back later. Are you serious? I just want to wait in her room, Em. I don't... I live here, too. You can't just come barging in here. I'm sorry. It's a bad time. It's all right. It's gonna be fine. You all right? Theo. It's so late. You should've called me. Are you hungry? I can make us something to eat, if you like? Oh, maybe a glass of wine? Em said you stopped by earlier. Oh, darling, will you open this? Please don't. I'm sorry? I saw you. Oh. You don't mean Tom Cable, do you? He's an old friend. Please, Kitsey. No more secrets. I didn't think it would matter until the wedding. I tried to break things off a while back, but... But you love him. I don't expect you to know what it feels like to be in love with the wrong person. Theo... does it really matter as much as all that? You know it doesn't. Not really. I know about your things. My things? Take all the drugs you want, I don't care. This marriage makes sense. Mommy loves you so much. It's a good match. We like each other and we get on. Head not heart? If you like. $2,000. Reilly and Britton, of course. First edition, first printing. As you can see, in beautiful condition. I'll take it. For yourself? No. A gift. Lucky person. Look at this. Stored in some unheated shed in Watervliet. It's amazing it survived at all, but look at the grain though. What? I didn't want to bother you. Bother me with what? This guy Reeve, Lucius Reeve, I sold him the chest-on-chest with the Affleck ornament. And? I sold it as an Affleck. I should have never, never. But I didn't know what to do. We had the IRS calling every other day, and now he's got it in for us. Well, give him the money back. I've tried. I don't know what he wants. Uh... Dealers live by their reputation, Theo. It's an honor system. If, uh... If word got out that... I'll put it right, Hobie. I'll offer him more than what he paid for the piece. I'm sure he just wants money. Hmm. Hobie? Pippa? Hello, lovely. Are you gonna change the sign? No. I didn't ask him to. I know you didn't. But Hobie's always saying you've turned things around. Quite the salesman. And who'd have thought it? Antique furniture? Do you miss it? New York? Don't let me forget, I've got a book for you. - Yeah? - Mmm-hmm. I've got something for you, too. It's good timing. I finished my book on the plane. I've got you The Rings of Saturn. Everett said he thought you'd like it. - Is it good? - Mmm-hmm. Great. I'm really glad you're happy, Theo. I can't believe I haven't even met her and you're getting married. Yeah. It was all pretty fast. Well, I guess when you know, you know. Okay. I'm bushed. Time for bed. Night. I remember the feeling of, "Who is this guy?" That each voice is so clearly etched in the eloquence with which he was able to play the left and the right hands, so they sounded almost like it was a duet played with yourself. I'm sorry. I thought you'd like it. I loved it. It just reminded me of that world. It was really hard, you know. You just practice, practice, practice, six hours a day. And then everything stopped that day. Now I can't even go to a concert. And Welty... you know, he was only with me that day because I was making him take me to an audition. It was my fault, Thee. Come home. Home here? Yes. What about Everett? When I was with Welty, when he gave me this ring, something happened between us. Like the way he guided me to the shop. The minute I was there, it felt right. And antiques? Why would I be interested? Who would've known that? But I was. It's like he sent me exactly where I needed to be. And to who I needed to be with. Pippa. - I... - I know. I know. Don't think I don't. Yes. I miss it. New York. But I'll tell you why I don't come back. Because at least in London, I don't think about it... every second of the day. But I miss it. I miss Hobie. And I miss you. We are an awful lot alike, Theo. What we both went through, I don't think we can lean on each other. If one of us went down... the other would go with them. Theo, I'm sorry. No. No. I'm sorry. It's okay. Yo. Jerome? I need some. Where do I go? Hit up my girl Katrina. Bar G-Slack off Avenue B. Does Katrina work here? Katrina? I'm a friend of Jerome's. He said, uh, she might be able to help me. What's her second name? Help you with what? It doesn't matter. Hey. Potter! Boris? How did you know I'd be here? I... I didn't. - You weren't looking for me? - What? This is just accident? Yes. All right. To accident then. Hmm? They serve food here? Not usually. What do you do? This, that. Many things, you know. Just getting by. You living in New York? No. I travel a lot. Sometimes here. Uh, Sweden, Belgium, Germany. - Russia? - Not so much. I thought maybe you went back to Russia because you never came. Well, um, very fucked-up time. For a while, I worked for Mr. Silver. What? I was living with Xandra at the time. What? My dad had moved. I had nowhere to go. We ended up getting along. Mr. Silver would come round. So for a while, I am his assistant. Do this, do that. I can't believe you're here. Do you know what I did in college? Conversational Russian, because of you. It used to make me think of you. Potter... I am so sorry for what I did to you. Forget it. No, I can't. Are you happy? Not very. A girl? Look, it's not that. It's... I'm engaged to be married. I don't know why I'm telling you this, but I saw her kissing another guy. Old friend of mine. Tom Cable. The asshole with the cigarette, when you were a kid? And you love her. But not too much, I think. It's complicated. There is someone else? All right. Enough of this. Let's go somewhere. Let's get a taxi. A taxi? You've got a fucking driver. You? I have a fucking driver! Gyuri, say hello to Potter. Hello, Potter. Hello, Gyuri. Watch the, uh... Watch, you're spilling it! Hold it still! Come work for me. Fate brings us together again. And you are not happy. I want to repay you because everything good that has happened is because of you. That's great. I got you started as a drug dealer. Not drug dealing. I have a good life. We could... I am so sorry, Potter. So sorry for what I did. - Forget it. - I can't forget it. That I should treat you so badly. And I have tried, I swear to you, I have tried to get it back. I thought you might have heard about Miami and I wanted to tell you that nothing, nothing could be traced back to you. No. You never opened it? All these years? How could you not fucking open it? Shut the fuck up. What are you... You had stayed, I would have... I would have given it back to you. I promise. Told you that I had switched it. But you wouldn't wait. You had to go straight away and I was scared to tell you that I'm so ashamed. Still so ashamed! Bullshit! Nobody knew about it. No one has ever... You are a blackout drunk, Potter. You showed me it. At Thanksgiving. Totally wrecked. You unwrapped it and showed me. And I wanted it. But not to sell. I swear to you. You cannot sell something like that. I don't believe... I don't believe one word you're saying. This is the back of the painting. The verso proved that we have it. The painting was used as collateral on certain deals. Until Miami. And I swear to you, Potter, I swear... What are you... Wait, Potter! Please, stop! Move! Get out! He came to see me today. Reeve. He had photocopies, bills of shipping. Dozens. All right. Listen... I wanted to tell you. I was just trying to settle some debts. I didn't know how to get out from under. No, no, you don't have to tell me. Business turning around and it suited me to keep my head in the sand. No, no, that's not what I'm saying. This is all my fault. And I'll fix it. That's not why he came. Is it true? Please tell me it isn't true. Hobie... I called him a liar and threw him out. Now, tell me. Is it true? The painting? Yes. Do you know the history of that painting? Do you know that it was his last painting because he died? Died in an explosion. A stupid accident. And one of the only things that survived, like a miracle, was that little bird. Like nothing that had been painted before. And somehow, miracle after miracle, it survives through centuries. Until you. Hobie, I never meant... I didn't know what it was at first. And then, I don't even know why I kept it. I was just trying to keep it safe. It wasn't yours to keep! My whole life, everything I've tried to do... I don't know. I don't know, maybe it's ignoble to care too much about objects. But, Theo... that painting, pulled from the fire... passed down, saved, preserved... so it could be handed on. And handed... We die. We all die. But to destroy, to lose something that should have been immortal... Is it lost? Hobie... I never meant you any harm. Never. Cheers. Happy for you two. Oh, thank you for coming. Come over and say hi to Anne. I think she's over there by the corner. Everything okay? The best thing that ever happened to her is when you came along. Did your mother know, Platt? She said from the beginning, it was just an infatuation. Women always love assholes, am I right? We need more drinks. Oh, hi. Which one is she? Is that her? Loveliest lady in the room. Go tell your lovely lady that you have to leave. What are you doing here? I have a ticket for you, but we must go now. - Where? - Amsterdam. Why the fuck would I go to Amsterdam? 'Cause you want it back. - I'll find you later, okay? - Yes. Oh! There you are. Oh, you must meet my godmother, Anne de Larmessin. What are you doing? Hmm? I'm going. You can't. There's more photographs. I'm going to be away for a few days. Make up an excuse for me. Are you coming back? Take care, Kitsey. Before and after. Everything is before and after. In the middle is the painting. The one thing you did. You crossed the border into another country. And now you can never go back. You cannot sell a painting like that, Potter. It's quickest way to get caught. People with goods, they front you, hold painting as collateral. You sell the goods, you give them their cut, painting is returned. Who? Who took the painting? A German guy I know. Deals in stolen art. Calls himself Sascha. Was involved in setting up the operation with those Miami assholes. And then, he went missing. Now Sascha is feeling heat from FBI raid. So he is willing to offload it for cash. Glad to see you again, Potter. You know, that's not actually my name. So? Sascha is here with the painting. Victor got in touch, said he had a buyer. An American businessman. And who's this American businessman? That would be you. You want the painting back? Yes? Yes. I am going to do this. I'm going to make everything right again. 40,000. My money. This they get to keep. That way, they don't look so close at bank draft. By the time they realize is no good, we are long gone. Now story is, you are based in New York, very rich man. Is just for show. There's someone in the back. No one there. Right, I'll see you later. A lot of trouble, but worth it, yes? Yes. Merry Christmas. Don't be a prick, Boris. Do it over there. Carel Pietersz, known as Fabritius, born in Holland in 1622. He's only 32 years old, but he's already considered one of the greatest painters in an age of great painters. He's painting in his studio in Delft when a nearby gunpowder store accidentally explodes. Neighbors pull a wooden panel from the rubble and on the panel is painted a goldfinch. For hundreds of years, it is passed hand to hand. It survives. Until me. To have kept it shut up in the dark all these years. A thing made of light. That only lived in light. I would've given it back. I swear. But it was too late. Things done that can never be undone. Things that come together. And things that fall apart. Hey. Stop. Hey. Hey. You need to walk. Yes? All right. Okay. Come on. All right. Okay. Let's go. There he is. That's it. Come on. The Chinese boy, maybe he runs back to Sascha. Gyuri knew this place in Frankfurt that Sascha used to use. Place is like fortress. Cameras, locks, pass-codes and shit. Need army to get in. Or police. Eat. You should. All right, so, problem is police need probable cause. Gyuri has cousin, works in very expensive bar. Now he goes to the police and says he sees two Germans arguing, and one of them leaves behind folder. And inside the folder? Photograph of Goldfinch, newspaper articles, and FedEx envelope with Sascha's address. Next day, is like movie. SWAT team fucking breaking down the door. I didn't see it happen. I wish I had. To see the look on Sascha's face, being dragged out. And yes. It is there. Your bird. They find it and it is safe. You are welcome. But there is more. They find other paintings. Stolen paintings. And also a Rembrandt. Now drink more coffee. Listen to me. Is important. You talk about bad things you have done. And you blame yourself. You wish... wish you were dead. So we have done bad things. But maybe sometimes good can come from bad. If you hadn't... if I hadn't... maybe none of these paintings would be found. Maybe is... like huge fucking weather system rolling over and we just get blown and maybe is fate or... Why give name? Just... life. Eh? Your bird is safely back in the world. Happy Christmas, Potter. Theo... there's too much to see. There's The Anatomy Lesson. And we should see Frans Hals, too. Oh. Look. I like this one. The Dutch invented the microscope. They wanted it all as detailed as possible. Even the tiniest things mean something. Like that wilted leaf there. That's the painter sending you a secret message telling you things don't last. Oh. Sorry. This is the one I was talking about. This is the painting I love most.
