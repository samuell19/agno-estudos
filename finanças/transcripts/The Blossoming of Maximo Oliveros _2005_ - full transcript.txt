THE BLOSSOMING OF MAXIMO OLIVEROS Is this good? It's the best. Have a drink. Who you been flirting with? Joey, it's your turn. Been drinking all morning? All morning. 5,000 pesos, that's cheap. Of course. What else? Is there a warranty? Sure. If it's broken give it back. I'll give you 1,000. Are you kidding? 1,000 for a new model? Well? All right, just trying to bargain. You know you'll sell it for more. Kuya (big brother), that hurts! Where you goin'? Put me down for 10 bucks on 47 17? 10 bucks? I don't have change. I'll give it to you next time. Bogs. Hey Janet... you look hot. Someone picking you up? No, why? Pick two numbers. If you win you can buy your own car. They let Egay out of jail. I talked to the captain. There's a new guy, doesn't know our arrangement. That captain is amazing. His face is as thick as his wallet. That's how it is. You take some, you give some. When do we eat? Hey, Maxi! I'm starving! Coming! Here it is! At last! Come here. What the hell is this? That's what they served in the DVD I watched. We've got a TV right here. Why do you go to that DVD place and hang around there? Fool, we're not rich. You wasted money so you could crave stars. Ouch! The vendor gave it to me for free. Really? It's delicious. Here, Maxi. Go to market and buy pork. I'm tired of fish. Someone's loaded today. You scored last night? Pa, can I have a cellphone? Cme on, don't be selfish. Asshole! You've got money, buy one! Okay, here's a cellphone for you. There. The color suits you. Come on. Why? This is only good for pounding garlic. Goddammit, why don't you get your own phone? Whatever. Wait, we haven't said grace. Take your money off the table. Boy... put down your foot. In the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit. Bless us O Lord and this food we are about to eat. In the name of our patron the Infant Jesus, we thank you. Eat up. Let me do that. Go ahead. Maxi serves me. Unlike you two. You should show some devotion. Here, this is for you. Buy your sanitary napkins. Thanks, Pa. You're welcome, son. I want the sanitary pads with wings. All right, here's your wings. What are you laughing at? Cut the nonsense! Eat up. Here he comes! That's bullshit. How can he beat all those guys by himself? He's the hero. There's only one of him. Bogs, gimme my cigarettes. How can you watch this, it's so noisy! The noise keeps you from thinking. You? Think? If I didn't use my head, you'd starve. Kuya, can I have this? Take it, it's yours. "The... Issk... Ischeemer"? Idiot! That's "Syemer". Wanna bet? Let me see. You're both idiots. Moron! It's "Chemer"! Dumbass! It's read as... You're both wrong. "Is-ke-hemer." It's "Is-ke-hemer." Papa's right. The Iskehemer. Pa is so smart. Damn right your pa is smart. Ishehemer. Yeah, right. No, no. Take it off. Off! No! No! Keep still! Stay clean, huh. Thanks, Maxi. While there's nothing!! Last night I dreamed of numbers 5 and 2. Those are my bets. Pick your own numbers. What's the game? Where'd you steal that? You're picking on me again. Hurry, Maxi! It's starting. Wait, I'm placing a bet! Hurry! You've got a good racket going. Of course. People love the movies. How do you say "Handsome" in Italian? How do you say "You're beautiful"? Wasn't the movie great? Especially when he grabs the girl and kisses her. I was so thrilled! What are you buying? It's Sandara. Isn't she pretty? What are you doing here? We watched a movie. A movie at Mr. Axel's? It's so hot here. Go on home. Bye. Playing hard to get! Ice water please. Want some? Yes, please. My treat. Four ice water. Fabulous! Maxi's rich today. Get one each. Schoolboy can't afford ice water. There, paid. Let's go, girls. Bye, faggot. I've loved and lost so many times. I don't want to be hurt again. Where are you. How pretty! Mr. Wow? Take your pick, girls. That's a lot! Give it back later, it's going to be sold. Take whatever you like! I won the Best Costume last week! Good evening, ladies and the lady-like! Presenting our Miss Universe pageant! Good evening everyone. I am Leslie, representing... Thailand! Buenas noches! Yo no soy marinero! I am Narda, from... Venezuela! Mabuhay (Long live)! I am Maxi... from the 7,100 islands of... the Philippines! Mother! Mother! I got promoted at work. I brought fried noodles, let's eat. Mother! Mother! Wake up! Mother, the noodles will get cold! Mother, the noodles will go to waste! Mother... you're even colder than the noodles! One night in my bed I heard the singing of a bird. I thought I was dreaming. Then I realized the singer was you. It's hard to trust handsome men. They'll take you for a fool. They'll make you cry and leave you dry once they're done with you. I want a man with big strong arms to protect me. He'll never leave. He's there when I need him If you win in this contest, what's the first thing you will do? If I win in this contest, the first thing I will do is... Can you repeat the question? What is love? Love is... It's dark, Papa will be home soon! I'm going. Wait, there's still the swimsuit competition! You have a good chance of winning. What a waste. Gotta run. Bye! Maxi, you're looking pretty. I'm always pretty. Let's see if it's smooth. Help! Rape! Let me go! Let him go! Just having a little fun. Want to go to jail? Sorry, sir, we were just kidding. Assholes! This is where I live. Here? Let me down. You sure? I'm okay. Good evening. What happened? Is that Maxi? Dammit, Maxi, maybe you were flirting with them! No I wasn't! Those assholes got some nerve! Wait til I get my hands on... Let it go, Bogs. They'll pay in karma. I'll take care of it, sir. I'll warn them and their parents. When did you get here? Just last week. Is that so. This is a fun neighborhood. You'll make many friends. Consider us your friends. Before I forget... Thanks a lot. Please, there's no need. Just doing my job. I have to go. Kuya (Big brother). Don't stay out late, okay? Quiet! We're trying to sleep!! Pest! Hey your favorite actress will be at the SM mall. Let's go! Oh, it's the SM mall in Cebu. First you have to save up for the boat fare. Stop teasing! I know that face. It's me! No way. It's Lolet. Only cleaner and sweeter-smelling. You're right. 5-1 won last night. Kuya Alan won! I'll bring him his winnings. Wait, where are you going? You're staying home. Bogs, you deliver the money. Let me, Pa! Come on, I'll walk with you. Okay, you go with him. Wait... I'll go too. All right, watch your brother. Hey, Janet! You free tonight? For you? Of course. Too bad... I'm not. Come with me. Here's your tip. Handsome and generous! Here's another 10! Place another bet. I'm innocent! This one's a thief. Talk to Mr. Paco. He knows me! What's his case? Theft. Throw him in the cage. Can't we fix this? You trying to bribe me? Toss him inside! Have you found joy in another... Now that we're apart It's finished? What happened? That's what you get for falling asleep. It's a bad movie. They didn't end up together. Quick! Look! Who did this to you? No one, sir, we fell asleep. With no clothes on? We fell asleep. There's no problem. We had a fight. But we're friends now. It's a miracle! What are you doing here? Go upstairs. Is that blood? It's nothing. I cut myself. Let me do that, Kuya. Go to sleep. You've got huge eyebags. Can you take out the stain? It's Bogs's shirt. It'll be our secret. Maxi, sew up my shorts. Leave it there, Kuya! Hey, where you going? Taking bets this early? Kuya, place your bets. Maxi, right? That's good. Eat up. You should try my cooking. It's so good, you'll forget your girlfriend's name. You can cook? Of course. At home I do the cooking... the laundry... the ironing. I even sew up torn shorts. Everything. You're a hardworking kid. You too. I've been waiting for you all day. It's late and you're just having lunch. There's a lot of work that needs to be done. You don't get paid a lot, do you? My pa makes more money than you do. What does your father do? Ma pa? He sells cellphones. That's a decent job as long as the phones aren't stolen. When you grow up get a job you can be proud of. I want to sell DVDs so I can watch them any time I like. That's all right, as long as they're not pirate DVDs, so I won't arrest you. Can't you make an exception? Friends or not, wrong is wrong. This early, I want you to understand. Fine. I bet you're ugly when you're angry. Here. How much? Let me pay. You don't have a job yet. No, let me. I make a lot taking bets. Thanks, but next time I'm buying. Save your money. Buy yourself a toy. I'm not a kid anymore. Then buy whatever you like. That asshole thinks he's something. Acts like he owns the place. All that money went to his head. And to his giant belly. Excuse me for interrupting. We're here to ask if you've heard anything about that murder the other night. Is that so? Beer chow. Thanks. The kid was robbed. Then stabbed three times. He was only 16! There was a witness but it was too dark. He's not exactly sure what he saw. Don't worry. If I hear anything I'll let you know. Look what you've done to my T-shirt. Hey Sarge. What's up? Somebody got robbed and killed. Hey, I had nothing to do with it. That's bad. Jesus will get pissed. I know that, Bogs. We have to go. Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Paco. Our bosses are giving us hell. Thank you very much. No problem. If I hear anything I'll let you know. Food! Innards, my favorite. Where are you going? Let's watch DVDs! I'm going to church. Bye. Kuya Victor! Maxi, leave that. The dirt is so thick potatoes would grow on it. Have you cleaned your own house? Of course, or my pa would get mad. Does he hit you? No. Just a little smack when I've been bad. What about your brothers? Are they good to you? They always tease me but they're cool. Kuya Bogs was my playmate when I was a kid. He takes my side when Papa scolds me. Kuya Boy... he's the serious one. When I was little my mother got sick and died. My Kuya Boy... he helps Pa in steal... in his work. Kuya Boy used to look after me. Then he got tired. What about you? Where's your family? They're in the province. This is my father. Why does he look like a priest? It only looks that way 'cause he's in white. This cross, is it his? This? He told me to wear it always, to remind me of him. So I won't become a pot-bellied cop. Where'd you get this? Let's go out. It's hot in here. You put your lips together. Then blow. Try again. Lips together, then blow. Don't you want to go back to school? We all know how to read and write. Pa says no one can take advantage of us. It's still better to finish school. You look like a smart kid. I am! I always win quiz contests. My classmate Peter was always envious of me. I was the teachers' favorite. And now he must be their new favorite. Kuya Victor, do you have a girlfriend? Do you see anyone with me? Just me. Why don't you have a girlfriend? It's just a distraction. Besides, I haven't met anyone I like. What kind of girl do you like? Why do you ask? What do you know about that stuff anyway? Kuya Victor, I'm already 12. I'm not a kid anymore. I know a lot. My friends already have boyfriends. Times really have changed. And you? When are you going to have a girlfriend? Yucch! I don't want a girlfriend! Gross! That's too bad. You're a good-looking kid. I'm out of here. All right, I'm sorry. It's a boyfriend you want. I'm going home. Suit yourself. Don't you want to know what kind of girl I like? I want someone who is... sweet... pretty... loving... and simple. Help me, help me! Help me, Paco! My son's been arrested! Look! What's the charge, sir? Friends, maybe we can talk this over. Sorry, Mr. Paco. We're taking him to the station. This one had drugs on him. You're too serious. You won't last long at your job if you don't lighten up. Some things shouldn't be taken lightly. Fine, take him. You're wasting your time. I hear you won at Bingo. Naah, it was the other guy. The other guy? How many Bobbies live on this street? Just one. Well, someone named Bobby won. You lucky guy. Five grand. And there's only one Bobby. You're buying the drinks. The drinks are on the way. Have a shot. Victor, have a drink. No thank you. You don't want to insult them. Sorry. Perez really can't drink. I'll take that. Have a bite. Thank you. No problem, okay? Asshole! He's making his own life difficult. He hasn't had a taste of real money. When he does, he'll crack. Let's just build a monument to him. A monument? A coffin is cheaper. Concrete is too expensive. Where do we order a coffin? That's easy. There's spare wood at the construction site. Did you take care of our boys on the other side? Yeah, it's all fixed. If there's a prob... you know... you come to me. Okay, you got it. Hey Perez, your girl's here. Am I not your type, Maxi? Victor's so lucky. He's got someone to bring him lunch. Any more friends like you, Maxi? Let's go outside. Are you sure you've eaten? You are a good cook. If you don't go into the DVD business you could be a cook. Work in a hotel or a restaurant. I only cook for people I know. My family and you. But when you get a job you can help your family. Do you want them to go on stealing? Hurting people? They don't mean to hurt people. They only do it to protect me. We're friends, right? Of course we are. Do you trust me? Why? I saw you the other night. You were burning a shirt. Whose shirt was that? Why did you burn the shirt? Don't be afraid. I won't get you in trouble. Just tell me the truth. Whose shirt was that? It was an accident. He didn't mean it. He's a good guy. He's not like that. He killed someone. He has to be brought to justice. Which of your brothers did it? That student didn't stand a chance. What about his family? Don't you feel sorry for them? I know you're a sensible kid. Tell me who did it. Don't be afraid. I don't know! Don't hide the truth. I told you, I don't know. What did that cop do to you? Kuya, he knows! What? He wanted me to rat on you. I didn't say anything. How did he know? Get inside. Sonofabitch! Damn you! I raised you a thief... but not a fucking killer! God damn you! Pa, that's enough. Maxi, let him sit. Damn you... Get away from your brother! Get away from him! Don't touch him! Do as I say! Get away from him, I'm telling you! Don't touch him! That's enough, Pa. Stop it, Pa... Enough! Stay away from that piece of shit! Easy, Pa. Please. All right, Boy, go to your aunt's house. Stay there until this blows over. If he leaves, he'll only look guilty. He can stay here. They have no evidence. Don't worry, Maxi. We'll handle that cop. Get him! You pain in the ass! Fuck you! That's for sticking your nose in our business! Motherfucker! That's just a taste. If you get in our way, you're dead meat. Don't worry. They'll be fine. Hey, is there any food? That made me hungry. Go wash your hands. What happened? We taught him a lesson, that's what. He didn't stand a chance. What a wimp. Couldn't even throw a punch. Look at my face, smooth as ever. No bruises. If he can't beat Bogs how can he stand up to me? No contest! Go home, Maxi. Leave me alone. Let's eat! You know what? You're very pretty this morning. What's wrong? Come here. I'm sorry. What? I'm sorry. Forget about it. It's my fault they beat you up. I told them... Don't worry about it. It was my own fault. I tried to make you confess. Go home. They must be looking for you. Why, Pa? I want you to stop seeing that cop. It's not his fault. He's only doing his job. You want to ruin our business? You want your brother to get arrested? So why don't you do something? It's your fault anyway. Goddammit, don't talk back to me! Go buy some rice. There's no food in the house. You take care of other people but not your own family. Go on. Hey! What? I told you not to throw your garbage there. If you don't take that away... I respect you, but... This doesn't taste like anything. Hey Maxi, did you forget the salt? Have some fish sauce. What's his problem? Did you pick a fight with him? No! Must be his monthly period. Hey, it's time to eat. Later. Kuya, you're heavy! Braid my hair. Go home. It's like a movie! Wow. Lovers' quarrel! Are you angry with me? Will you please go home. Find someone your own age. Hang out with them. I don't have time for this. What's the problem? Come here. Get in. That's enough. Come on, Maxi. What's this? Forget him. He's a stupid jerk. That's enough. Show him that you're strong. He's not the only guy in the world. You want me to kick his ass? Here's the deal, Maxi. I won't tell them at home, but you swear you'll stop seeing him. If I hear you've been seeing him, I will be angry. Understand? Take care, Sarge. What's your name, kid? Victor Perez, sir. Showtime's over. Back to work. This one's a straight shooter. Too bad Sarge is gone. He was good for business. We have to lie low for a while. The chief's been replaced. The new chief has it in for us. We're in the shit. Bad enough there's that cop, now the chief is putting the squeeze on us. Don't be throwing your money around. Life is hard. If we're not careful, we'll go hungry. Save your money. There's a new tenant downstairs. Where's Lolet? She ran off with some American. You okay with that, bro? Dumped by an old whore. Fuck you! Shut your trap! How much do you have in the bank? I don't have a bank account. Are you sure? That can be verified easily. I have an ATM account. I think there's... 300 pesos in it. 300. I like your record. From now on you'll assist me in all of my operations. I'll train you to be a real cop. What do you mean, sir? You're not a real policeman yet, Perez. You're raw. I can help you. That is... if you accept my offer. Motherfuckers! You've gone too far. Get up! Turn around! Sit! Nobody move! What did we do? Down! Down! Open up. We have a warrant to search your house. Thought he wore panties. These are all briefs. My things! Anything there? Nothing here. Just doing our job. Sit down. Nice dress. Look. Really nice! This yours? Not that! You must've stolen it from the neighbors. That's my Mama's dress! What do we have here? This is a pirate CD, it's illegal! Nothing here, bro. Let's go. Let's go. Tell me what's going on. There's trouble, Maxi. People are getting caught. People are squealing. They've arrested your Kuya Bogs. What happened? What happened? Your brilliant Victor put him in jail. But I'll think of something. You'll beat him up again? No. We're not going to beat him. You're going to kill him? They're charging your Kuya Bogs with murder! They say they have a witness. But it was Kuya Boy who did it. Your Kuya Boy! Did you tell that policeman? I'm not leaving. No. You're going. You'll be safe there. Let's go. They're not going to arrest me. I'll watch over you. Watch over us? You'll watch over your Victor. I didn't do aything, it's your fault. Shut the hell up. Your aunt is waiting. Let's go. No. I'm staying here. Did you kill him, Bogs? You could get the death penalty for this. It wasn't me. Who was it? Your father? Your brother? Why you asking me? Isn't it your job to investigate? I'll go get coffee. What are you waiting for? What? Go on, kick the crap out of me. You're safe, there's no witness. You can get even. You happy? I'm not like the other cops you know. You're right. You're the dumbest cop I've ever met. You still owe me one. For Maxi. Wait! Don't I get one phone call? Don't you care about us, Maxi? Your Kuya Bogs... could hang. Why do we live like this? You never complained before. Then that Victor comes along and suddenly you're ashamed of us. If your mother were alive, she'd be angry with you. Is he more important to you than we are? I just want our life to be peaceful. What more do you want? Aren't you contented with this life? Do you realize that we risk our lives to put food on the table? Pa, isn't there another way? Like what? I get a job in a factory. I work like a dog for small change. Then someone gets sick. Then I can't afford to pay the hospital. Never again. I'm not going to lose another member of this family. What took you so long? I went to see Bogs. How is he? Victor's got hie eye on us. I hear he got promoted. Go home. Stay with Maxi. Why? Where are you going? I have to talk to someone. I'm coming with you. Forget it. I'm going alone. Where is Pa? Clear the table. I'm not eating. His gun isn't here. Is he going to kill Kuya Victor? All I hear from you is that Victor! Have you done it with him? Tell me where Papa is! What's he going to do to Victor? Why don't you just let Victor die? No! I won't let it happen. Well? Are you here to make peace? Dominguez. What's this, a reunion? Good thing you still remember me, Paco. It's been a long time. How are you? Two years. Not long enough. I'm the chief now. What do you think of that? You must be good at kissing your boss' ass. That's what I like about you. Even now, I'm about to get my star, and you still have no fear. You have no star yet. I have many. You're going to shoot me yourself? Why don't you let your sidekick do it so he can get some practice. You don't owe him. You owe me. Fuck! You motherfuckers! Sir, please help me. I heard my son was locked up here. What's the charge? You son was high. He doesn't do drugs. Those were deoderant salt, not crack, sir. Why'd he rape that girl, then? Rape? No. Oliveros. You're free to go. Hey Bogs. You're lucky. You can go. We can't just let this pass. Papa didn't stand a chance. I'm going to kill those fuckers. I spoke to the others. They'll help us. God damn them all! Stay here. Don't go outside. Don't leave. We have a score to settle. What about me? You're going to leave me alone? You'll die too? We're not going to die. Well? Let's go. What? This world is full of evil men. Sometimes you have to play their game. Or else nothing will change. Do you understand? Yes. There are many evil men. But I only had one father. Aren't you done yet? Almost finished. There, that'll do. You got everything? Don't forget your Philippine History book. I've got it. Hurry up, you don't want to be late. Your ID? Here. Pin it. Cut the corny stuff. Quick. Kuya, this isn't mine. Oops, wait. There. Wow. Maximo Oliveros. Here's your lunch. I'm putting it in your bag. Your bag. Quick. My sister is so pretty. Go. Pay attention in class. Money's hard to come by these days. Yes, Kuya.
