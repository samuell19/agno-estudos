Saputra Jakarta, Indonesia 30/12/2021 hmm it was the hour that treat the pharaoh bellman which gives the sterns to goodnight he is about it that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold but i've quenched them and given me fire the doors are open and the surfeited grooms do mock their charge with snores i have drugged their posits that death and nature do contend about them whether they live or die confounds us hark i laid their daggers ready he could not miss him my husband i have done the deed is thou not hear a noise when now as i descended a foolish thought to say a sorry sight this wounded laugh in his sleep and one cried murder that they did wake each other i stood and heard them but they did say their prayers and addressed them again to sleep the grooms were lodged together one cried god bless us and amen the other as they had seen me with these hangman's hands listening their fear i could not say amen when they did say god bless us consider it not so deeply but wherefore could not i pronounce on men i had most need of blessing and our men stuck in my throat these deeds must not be thought after these ways so it will make us mad he thought i heard a voice cry sleep no more left that had murdered sleep the innocent sleep sleep that knits up the rattled sleeve of care the death of each day's life sore labor's bath bomb of hurt minds great nature's second course cheap nourisher and life's feast what do you mean still had cried sleep no more to all the house go home that murdered sleep and therefore quarters shall sleep no more no more who wasn't that does cry why worthy thing you do unbend your noble strength to think so brain sickly of things go get some water and wash this filthy witness from your hand why did you bring these doctors from the place they must slide their gold carry them and smear the sleepy grooms with blood i'll go no more i'm afraid to think what i have done look on to get night they're not in firm give me the dagger the sleeping and the dead put his pictures to see i have childhood that fears a painted devil i'll guilt the faces of the grooms with all for it must seem their guilt my hands are of your color but i shame to our hearts white what is that knocking how is it with me when every noise appalls me what hands are here i block out mine eyes will all great neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my hand now all of this my hand will rather the multitude of this season gonna die making the green one bread you know my day to best not know myself wake dunking with my knocking i would now cut oh where's the knocking in these the man reported hell gate he should have old turkey the key not that who's there is a french host come in santa here you may roast your cruise oh knock knock never required yeah oh over this place too cold for hell is a great provoker of three things what three things yeah it knows painting sleep and yeah oh literally sir it provokes and unprovokes it provokes the desire but it takes away the performance therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lecturing it makes him an embarrassment sets him on and he takes him off it persuades him disheartens and makes him stand too and not stand too in conclusion equivocates him in the sleep and giving him the lie leaves him i believe drink gave me the lie last night good tomorrow both is the king stirring worthy thing not yet he did command me to call tommy on him and i've almost slipped me out make sure to call there's a king hence today he does he did the point the so has been unproven when we lay our chimneys would blow down and as they say lamenting's heard in the air strange screams of death and prophesying with accents terrible of dire combustion and confused events new hatch to the woeful time the obscure bird cometh to live long night some say the earth was feverish and did shake it was a rough night you should now have made his masterpiece most sacrilegious murder that broke up the lord's anointed temple and stole it's the life of the building menu his majesty's the chamber and destroy your sight with a new golden dinner bit me speak seek and then speak yourselves awake awake bring the amount of god murders treason is from your graves rise up in me from this incident there's nothing serious in mortality always but toys what's the business that such a hideous trumpet calls to parlay the sleepers at that renown and grace is dead the one of life is drawn too cruel anywhere what is the mist you are and do not note the spring the head the fountain of your blood is stopped the very source of it is stopped your father his murder by whom those of his chambers it seemed had done it their hands and faces were all badged with blood oh yet i do repent me of my fury that i did kill them wherefore did you sell who can be wise amazed temperate and furious loyal and neutral in an instant no man the expedition of my violent love outran the pauser reason here play duncan his silver skin laced with his golden blood and his gash stabs looked like a breach in nature for ruins wasteful entrance they're the murderers steep in the colors of their trade their daggers unmanly breached with gore who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart courage to make his love known look to the lady when we have our naked frailty's head which suffer and exposures let us meet question this most bloody piece of work to know it further why do we hold our tongues that most may claim this argument for ours this away our tears are not yet brewed there's no consort with them to show an unfelt sorrow as an office which the false man does easy i'll to england to island i our separated fortune shall keep us both safer where we are as daggers and men smiles the near and blood the nearer bloody this murderous shaft that shot have not been lighted and our safest way is to avoid the aim therefore the horse and let us not be dangerous here comes the good

predominance or the day's shame the darkness does the face of earth entomb when living light should kiss it it's unnatural leaving like the deed that's done on tuesday last a falcon tearing in a pride of place was by a mouse in our hawk hadn't killed and duncan's horses i think most strange and certain beauties and swift the minions of their race turned wild in nature broke their stalls flung out contending against obedience as they would make war with mankind they said they ate each other how hosted now king corridor flams all as the weird women promised and i fear that plates must fairly for it yet it was said it should not stand in my posterity but that myself should be the root and father of many kings if thou come true from them as upon thee macbeth their speeches shine why by the

traitor and must be hanged who must hang them by the honest men then the liars and swerve fools there are liars and spirits enough to beat the honest men and hang up them my lady how about thomas bless you fair dame i am not to you known though in your state of honor i am perfect i doubt some danger does approach you nearly if you would take a homely maid's vice be not found here hence with your little ones with this life i remember now i am in this earthly world where to do harm is often laudable to do good sometime accounted dangerous folly why then i'll ask do i put up that womanly defense to say i have done no harm where's your husband i hope that no place so unsanctified such as thou may find him he's a traitor let us seek out some desolate place and there we pass sad bosoms empty let us rather hold fast the mortal sword and like good men destroyed our downfall birthdam each new mourn new widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows strike heaven on the face that it resounds as if it felt with scotland and yelled out like syllable of dollar what you spoke it may be so perchance this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues was once thought honest see who comes here i have a gentle cousin welcome heather i know him now good god the times remove the means that makes us strangers sir amen stan scotland where it did last poor country almost afraid to know itself it cannot be called our mother but our grave where nothing but who knows nothing is once seen to smile where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air are made not marked where violent sorrow seems a modern ecstasy what's the nearest grief that of an hour's age death is the speaker each minute team's a new one how does my wife why well not my children well two tyrant is not batted at their peace no they were well at peace when i did leave him you're not a negative your speech how goes it when i came here to transport the tidings which i have heavily born there ran a rumor of many worthy fellows that were out now is the time of help your eye in scotland would create soldiers make our women fight to doff their dire distresses be it their comfort we are coming through gracious england has lent us good seaworth and ten thousand men a stronger and a better soldier none that christendom gives out well i could answer this comfort with the like but i had words that would be held out in the desert air where hearing should not latch them what concern they the general cause or was it a fee grief due to some single breasts no mind that's honest but in it shares some woe though the main part pertains to you alone if it'd be mine keep it not from me quickly let me have it let not your ears despise my tongue forever which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard i guess added your castle is surprised your wife and babes savagely slaughtered to relate the man we're on the quarry of this murdered deer to add the death's view merciful heaven what man give sorrow words the grief that does not speak whispers the overthrowed heart and bits it break my children too wife children servants all that could be found my wife killed two i have said be comforted let's make us medicines of our great revenge to cure this deadly grief he has no children all my pretty ones did you say all okay oh what are my pretty chickens and they're damn and one fell swoop disputing like a man i shall do so but i must also feel it as a man i cannot remember such things were that were most precious to me did heaven look on and would not take that part and tough they were all struck for me not that i am not for their own demerits but for mine they'll slaughter on their souls heaven rest them now peace the white stone of your sword let grief convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage oh i could play the woman with mine eyes and brag it with my tongue with gentle heavens cut short all into mission front to front to bring now this fiend of scotland and myself within my sword's length set him if he escape heaven forgive him too when was it she last walked since his majesty went into the field i have seen her rise from her bed show her nightgown upon her unlock her closet take full paper fold it right upon it read it afterwards seal it and again return to bed yet all this while in a most fast sleep in this slumbery agitation besides her walking and other actual performances what at any time have you heard her say that sir which i will not report after her neither to you nor anyone having no witness to confirm my speech oh you here she comes this is her very guise and upon my life fast asleep observe her stand close i see your eyes are open i that their senses are shut i'll keep you by that light she has light by her continually just her command what is

secrets more need she the divine than the physician was she going out of bed directly there's knocking at the gate come come come come give me her hand what's done cannot be undone to bed what what is

some say he's mad others that lesser hate him who call it valiant fury but for certain he cannot buckle his distemper cause within the belt of room now does he feel his secret murder sticking on his hands those he commands move only in command nothing in love now does he feel his title hang loose about him like a giant's robe before a dwarfish thief the devil damn the black thou creamed face loon

round hang those that talk of fear give me my armor i'm as your patient doctor not so sick my lord as she is troubled with sick coming fancies that keep her from her rest cure but can still not minister to a mind diseased but from the memory of rooted sorrow raise out the written troubles of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the stuff bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart there in the patient must minister to himself throw physic to the dogs i'll none of it see again turned out i will not be afraid of death and vain till born of foreign let every soldier hew him down a bow and bear it before him it shall be done we learn no other but the confident tyrant keeps still in dancing and will endure our setting down before it this is his main hope and none served with him but constrained things whose hearts are absent too i got our banners on the outward wall the cries feel they come our castle's strength will laugh as easter scorn here let them lie till famine in the egg you eat them up lead our first battle worthy mcduff and we shall take upon what else remains to do we will find the tyrant's power tonight let us be greed if we cannot

like those you are make all our trumpets speak give them all breath those clamorous homages of blood and death what is that noise it's the cry of women my good lord i've almost forgot the taste of fears the time has been my senses would have cooled to hear a night shriek and my fellow hair would add a dismal treaties rouse and stir as if life ranked therefore was that crying the queen my lord is dead he should have died hereafter there would have been a time for such a word tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last silhouela recorded time and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death life is but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing gracious my lord i should report that which i say i saw but now not how to do it well say sir i looked toward burnham and anonymity thought the wood
