I had to call several times. Where have you been? Yeah. I know. It's been a long day. I just got off my shift. Did you go somewhere? No, I just left the house for some groceries. They finally had some on the shelves for once. I think people are finally calming down. Okay. Well, I'll see you in a few. Don't forget to log into the company link I sent in the email. Yeah, yeah. All right, I'll look it up beforehand. Thanks for that. Tell me you're eating healthy. You can't work these hours without good food. Yep, I'm making a super nutritious dinner as we spea. Do you still have the bread I made you? It's here. Um, you know how much I love your homemade bread. I'll be having the last slice tonight. Glad I could help. All right. No problem, man. Hey, before you go... What was that? Did you ever get ahold of Kenzie? Kenzie... Kenzie who? My sister. Oh, right. Yeah, your sister. No, I haven't yet, but I've programmed her into my phone, so it will happen eventually. Why? What else are you eating? Mom? I've gotta go. Is that the microwave I hear? Kenzie! Do you need me to go shopping for you? No, I don't need you to go shopping for me. You stay home. It's a pandemic for crying out loud. Your father says this is just a bad flu. Does she look like you? Be honest. How are we even supposed meet, huh? Wave at each other from six feet apart? Wimp. Hey, I gotta run. If you do get brave enough to contact her, let me know how it goes. All right, man. I'll see you in a bit. Yeah, we'll see you, man. You guys at least wearing the masks I got you? What masks? In the package I mailed like months ago. I think I remember. I'll check and see if I can find them. Where did I put them? You said you were putting them in the drawer by the bed so you wouldn't lose them. Well, we'll be fine. I love you, Kenzie. Love you too. Have a good day. Now is not the time to meet a woman. No, please. Please, no. Oh no! No, please! Oh, please do not text back. No, no. Who is this, question mark? I hate me. I so hate me right now. Hey, it's Chase Montgomery, period. Sorry I accidentally sent that to you. No worries, period. Do I know you, question mark? Not officially, no. But Brian gave me your number last week and I haven't said hello yet. And are you mad about something, question mark. I'm more embarrassed than mad, comma. I honestly don't know how I sent that, period. I was looking at Brain's text and I set my phone down and... it, period, just, period, happened, period. I, comma, also, comma, have a habit of accidentally sending inappropriate emojis, period. Like when someone says their dog dies, comma, I send a laughing emoji, period, or the wink one, period. It is so mortifying, period. Okay that's funny! Except when it's not, period. Hey, I have a meeting in about 10 minutes, period. Do you mind if I video chat with you afterwards, question mark. Are you busy, question Mark. Video chat, question mark. Okay, period. Great. Thanks for... being chill. Oh, be chill. What am I doing? He's not gonna smell me. There you are! Hi! Hello! Your meeting was a lot shortr than I thought it'd be. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We try to keep our meeting short these days. It's a lot harder to pretend like you're awake in an online meeting. Everyone's staring right at you. Oh, I wish. I'm an essential employee, so we still have our meetings in person, just six feet apart. That's insane. This whole thing is insane. So, how do you know my brother Brian? Has he not said anything about me to you? Um, no. I didn't even know you had my number. Uh, yeah. Again, sorry about that earlier. It was- - No, I told you, I do the same thing all the time. It is the worst. It really is. And then there's no going back after it. None. Just you and pure mortification. So have you really sent wink emojis to people who announced deaths, or were you just saying that to make me feel better? No, that's all me, and I've done it more than once. How many times? A year? Probably five. Okay. Now that's just funny! No, it is so awkward! You have no idea. Hm, I'm thinking I do have a bit of an idea. I mean, come on. How many beautiful women get random angry face texts from numbers they don't know? I couldn't guess. Well, you're the first for me. Although I'm glad I sent it now. You just made this pandemic a lot more fun. Oh really? Yeah. So... I'm Kenzie, Brian's younger sister. And I'm Chase, his coworker. And sometimes partner in crime. We're on the same design team a lot. Cool. What's it like to work with my brother? Good. Yeah, he's a great guy. Although suddenly I'm finding myself more interested in getting to know you. What do you do? Why are you so essential? I work at a nursing home. So the old people kind of need me. It's a thing. Nice. And yet you are home at 5:00? Yeah. Normally I'm off at noon. I work 4:00 to noon, but today we had a death, so it was a little bit later. Oh, oh. COVID? Yeah. It was hard, but we kind of expected it. His daughter, before we shut down completely, brought it with her on a visit, and... She's since recovered. He suffered nearly three weeks. Oh, man. You've actually known someone who has it. Yeah. A few. I kind of thought it might have been a myth, you know? Right, I get it. But no, it's real here. Any-who... I didn't mean to be a downer. No, it's fine. As crass as it sounds, I've seen a lot of death in my line of work. Yeah, I bet you have. But you still smile. I've got plenty to smile about. I have a job. I have my health. And I'm talking to you right now. Good one. So would you... like to talk to me more? I mean, have I scared you off? Not at all. I mean, yes, I would like to chat more. Okay. It's a deal. Let's do this crazy thing. In the middle of the pandemic. It is pretty bizarre. But fun, no? Yeah. Maybe, yeah. It was good seeing you, Kenzie. Thank you, Chase. Let's do it again sometime. Okay. Have a good day. You too. Whew! Hello? Brian! You didn't tell me your sister was hot! Dude! A little heads-up would have been nice. Uh, she's my sister. No way. I can't bring the virus back to work, period. I have to social distance, period. Sorry. You're right. My bad, period. I keep forgetting the world is ending. But I would still like to get to know you more. Kinda hard. It is. But maybe I can come up with something. What, question mark. Shh. I'm thinking, period. Give me a minute and I'll come up with something brilliant. If you say so, period. Burn, exclamation mark. You mock now. That meant to be "now", not "cow". Nevermind. Hello? I figured it out. In fact, I made a whole list. Of what? Social distancing dates. You made a list of dates we can go on? Yup, and you're gonna love it. Text me your email. I'm gonna send them over to you, and you can pick one, and we can go from there. You want me to pick a date? Yeah! And then it'll be my turn next. You're not gonna send my email to some Nigerian Prince, are you? Dang it! I had such high hopes. $4,000 was waiting for me if I could only fool you. I knew it. No, come on. I've been working on this all day. Okay, okay. Let's see. Let me see what I'm getting myself into. Okay, this is pretty much amazing. Do you like it? I love it. I can't believe, d- Did you really come up with all of these today? Yeah. Actually, it was easier than you think. Once I started it, they came pretty quick. And you did all of this so you could get to know me. Well, yeah. I mean, that and 4,000 from Nigerian royalty Chase... This is pretty much the sweetest thing anyone's ever done. Thank you. So what do you say? What do you want to do first? All of them. Oh, come on. You gotta start with one. Okay. Let's start with an easy one. Play a virtual board game together. Okay. Awesome. What do you like to play? Now? As in, we're having this date now? I mean, I'm just hanging out at my place. What are you doing? Dumb days quarantine inferno. See? Now's better than not, right? I just would like to look a little nicer. Pssh! Oh, I'm sure you look just fine. Also. I turn into a pumpkin at 8:00 p.m. So... I have to be work at 4:00. Well, it is 5:30 now. Let's meet back at 6:00? And we can play for a couple hours. How does that sound? I will take what I can get. Hi, Mom. I can't really talk right now. I've got a date in 30 minutes. What? Why would you do that to yourself? Aren't you in quarantine? It's not a real date. We're playing a board game together online. This is a blind internet date? How do you know he won't become a vicious stalker or something? You need to be very careful. I know. I know, Mom. I'll be cautious. How can you be ready to put yourself out there like this? I'm not ready. However, I am bored out of my mind. And he makes me laugh. So maybe laughing is good for me, you know? I don't think you realize how hard this has been. For me, for your dad. I mean, just the thought of you dating again. I don't know if we can handle it. Mom, it's been hard on everyone, okay? But this is just one date. That's all it is. I love you, but this is exactly what I'm talking about. I love you too. I gotta go. Very well. Bye. Just give me one minute. Okay. Whew! Okay! I'm here. Just to have to get something to eat real quick. Wow, that was quick. Yep. Life in the nursing home has prepared me for everything. I bet. Although, you should have said something. I brought enough snacks to share. Right! What was I thinking? Wait, are those carrots I see? Well, you know, I had to make it look like I wasn't a complete heathen. I would never judge you. Good. However, I am totally jealous. I'll wait while you go grab some. Yeah, it'd be nice if I have carrots in my fridge, or any fresh fruit or veggies. I've been a slacker as to shopping lately. Scared of it that bad, huh? Something like that. Well, we only have two hours, so I was wondering if you would like to lose to a mad game of checkers. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Are you implying that I am going to lose to you? You do know, I kicked Brian's trash like at least 20 times! Well, you've never played with Chase the Ace. Chase the what? Ace. Don't worry, it'll grow on you. I'm not worried, 'cause that ace is going is flatten your face. Oh, bring it on, princess! Princess? Give me a break! I am so much more than a princess! And you... are going down. This is gonna be fun. For me. Okay... ladies first. Thank you. What! Okay, you've gonna be cheating somehow. I'm not cheating! How could someone cheat on a digital game? Okay. Let's go again. I'm gonna win! Again. Ah! Third try! You are not gonna see this one coming. Bring it on. That's not funny. Woo! Dang it! Okay, miss pumpkin. I should let you go. Is that the time? How? I don't know. I wouldn't believe it either, except... I'm all out of snacks. We've been playing nearly three hours? I demand a rematch by the way. It's statistically impossible that you would beat me that much. I'm not actually sure you've ever played this game before. Whatever! it was just an off night. I see. Sure, I'll take your rematch. Is that your way of asking me out again? Oh, we're going out again. That's already happening. This is just a way for me to recover what's left of my fragile ego. I had a really great time tonight. So did I. Goodnight, Kenzie. Right. And thank you for a wonderful evening. Goodnight. Oh! Why in the world am I such a freak of nature? Could there be adorable person on this planet? Are you here? Are kidding me? How sweet are you? I didn't know what your favorites were, so I got a little bit of everything. I have red bell peppers and... cabbage and carrots, like everything! Did you see the fruit? I love little clementines. And apples and strawberries? Oh my goodness, I'm gonna cry. Surprise. Happy quarantine. This is the happiest Quarantine Day ever. It wasn't meeting me? But really, Kenzie, if you need anything, just let me know. How much do I owe you for these? Nothing! I don't buy a bunch of stuff you know nothing about and expect you to pay for it. Well, when you put it that way. However, I am totally fine picking up stuff for you every now and then. That I pay you for, right? Of course. I could be your personal shopper. Eh, that sounds so... Awesome? Look, I'm bored out of my mind. And this is something that would be easy for me. Well, thank you. I might take you up on it at some point, but it won't be for a little while. I'm pretty well stocked. You're welcome. I'm glad you enjoyed your surprise. Yeah. It was very thoughtful. Great. Now, at the bottom of your box you should find a bag of jasmine rice and some soy sauce. Found them. I was thinking for tonight's date we could do our own live cooking show. Do you like stir fry? I love it! I'm thinking asparagus stir fry with red bell peppers, carrots, and cabbage over rice. Wow. That sounds perfect. Does 5:00 work for you? It does. But you... need to send me your address, please. I might want to surprise you with something at some point. Fine, I will text it to you right now, but please don't egg my house. Yeah... Are there even eggs in the stores now? Good point. Hey, Dad. What's up? Good. You okay? Everything's great here. Just enjoying the grind from home. I'm glad to hear it. Yep. Keeping busy. So you have a minute to talk. There's something I really need- - Hey, Dad... I got a meeting in a few. Could I call you back later? Sure, sure. No problem. I love you, son. Great, yeah. It's good to hear from you. Love you too. What do I do if my rice starts to boil over? Have you made rice before? Just the instant kind. You probably have the heat up too high. Just turn it down a bit. Make sure it's still simmering though. Do not forget about the stir fry. The trick to it is you gotta keep stirring it. Ah! Okay. Now what? Go ahead and taste your carrots. If they're tender, then you want to add the asparagus, then the cabbage. Oh! Gonna use the cabbage that we cut up earlier, right? Yup. Should be right there. But first the asparagus. Okay. You're doing great. Done. Okay. Now you will want to add the cabbage. I feel so professional. I love it! Me too. Hey, I'm going to add a bit more garlic powder to mine. I don't think I had enough. Taste yours, see if you need to add something else. Maybe a bit more soy sauce. But, man, this tastes good. All right. Do you have your plate? Yup, right here! Your rice should be done soon. Go ahead and check it. Okay. I did it! I did it! It looks perfect! Look! All right. I think mine is done. Yup. I can't even tell you how good this smells. What are the chances it smells like mine? You look good in an apron, by the way. Well hello there, beautiful lady. Thank you for sharing this meal with me. I can't believe how flustered you make me. Why's that? I don't know. I feel like I'm in high school again. I'm gonna take that as a compliment. It was meant as an insult, so... Oh! Good to know. So, verdict? Yeah, the food is fantastic! It is so tasty. If this works out, you gotta let me cook for you. I'll come make you my specialty pizza. Maybe. We'll see. That wasn't a no. I'm gonna take it as a yes. Just for curiosity's sake, what is your specialty pizza? I should warn you, I'm a monster. I believe pineapple was made for pizza. Oh! You're one of those people. And proud of it. I have never actually tried it, so I wouldn't know. What? Oh! Ham, pineapple and black olives are the trifecta to a perfect pizza. With red pepper flakes. Marry me. Red pepper flakes are essential to a pizza. I think you're really gonna like pineapple. Okay. Okay, I promise I'll try it one day. If it brings out a marriage proposal, it must be something special. So, tell me something about you. Oof. Anything? Where'd you learn to cook? My mom. I would love to say my dad and break the stereotype, but no, it was my mom. She loved the kitchen and brought me in as her sous chef. Taught me to love it too. I wish. My mom worked too much to hae extra time in the kitchen. Any siblings? Ugh, three older sisters. Whoa! What was that like? Having just my older brother was enough. I can't imagine having more. It was odd at times. I was basically their human baby doll. Oh, actually I could see that. Did they dress you up. Yes. In like... Dresses? Yes. Everything. Every Halloween costume, every play dress they had. Every action hero princess. Yes. So are there pictures? No, not until I get to cook for you. Okay, fine. I guess I can wait for that. To earn it. I like having sisters now though, if that helps. Yeah. You guys close? Well, I am the favorite uncle, so... Oh, I bet. Do you bring the kids candy? Oh, dude, I spoil them hard, intentionally. I know bribery works on children, and you should see them lose their little minds when I pull up. Everyone thinks they're cute and adorable and love me, but no, I bring a bag of candy, and I slip them pieces and tell them if anybody fins out, I'm cuttin' them off. No you don't! I so do. Wait, so the kids come running up, screaming, "Chase! Chase!" all for you to slip candy ino their greedy little hands? I have mastered the art of the candy giving hug. And no one's figured it out? Kids are smart. They're not about to mess up a good thing. You face lights up when you talk about 'em. Does it? They're so fun. I've got six nieces and nephews and another one on the way. Do you miss 'em? During this quarantine scam? Yeah. I can't imagine how hard it must be for the kids, not being able to have the parties they planned. Yeah, it's tough. So what about you? What's your family like? Well... It's complicated. Oh? Yeah, let's just say I enjoy watching other families work. What about Brian? We needed each other a lot as kids. In some ways that's still true. You don't get along with your parents. We function. I don't know if we function well, but we are what we are. I think all families feel like that at times. Yeah, maybe. I have to say, I am very impressed. Who knew social distancing could be this fun? And we got to have dinner together. And I learned a new skill. Rice. Thank you again for being a good sport. So, next time is my turn? Mm! There's gonna be a next time? I like where this is headed. Yes. It's your choice. Okay. I will take a look at the lit and let you know tomorrow. There's a lot of ideas I want to try. I just have to narrow it down. Hey, I got all the time in the world. We can go on as many dates as you like. I will remember that. Again, thank you. And especially thank you for my surprise and all that amazing food. See you tomorrow, Kenzie. Hey, Dad. Sorry I didn't call earlier. What's up? Did you need something? Yes. Actually, your mom's taken a turn for the worse. We had to go to the hospital. What was that? Hold on, slow down a bit. Mom did what? Her breathing got really bad a couple of hours ago, and I finally took her in. She was tested for COVID. Okay. How long until we find out? Up to four days. Are you kidding me? Okay, so the hospital's holding her, then? It gets worse. The doctors are saying she's only got a 10% survival rate. Her breathing isn't even strong enough to talk on the phone. Hey, you. What's up? Calling to repent Of? Not taking the stupid virus thing. That sounds ominous. Yeah, it is a little. You want to talk about it? No. I just feel like I'm going insane stuck in this house! Chase, are you okay? I don't know. I'm struggling. I can tell. My mom was rushed to the hospital last night during our date. Oh. Chase, I'm so sorry. They tested her for COVID, but it could take up to four days for us to get the results back. Is she okay? I don't know. She's not allowed any visitors, and my dad said her breathing's so bad right now, he doesn't want any of us to call her. Wait, what? Just... I'm regretting everything I said about this plague, and I just want it gone now. So I'm repenting. I was wrong. You were right. I never said anything about- - No, but I have, an for that I'm sorry. I just wish this whole thing was over and we could go back to when life was sane. The good old days. Exactly. Yeah, one thing's for sure. This pandemic has made me question everything. Yeah, in a weird you've only got one life, and am I living it the way I dreamed way. Yes. What if there's no tomorrow? Am I prepared for that outcome? Okay, no. Let's talk about something else, please. Right. Sorry. So... are you calling to vent? 'Cause you are definitely welcome to do that. Or do you need a distraction? Vent or distraction. That's a tough call right now. Chase, you're really not doing well. How is your mom other than the breathing? Well, she recovered from lung cancer two years ago, so there's that. Oh, that's not good. Nope. And no visitors? Nope. Okay. You need a distraction. Give me 15 minutes and turn on your video chat. What? Look, I'm usually up for any type of distraction but is that really called for right now? You dork, get your mind out of the gutter. But just give me a second, okay? All right, fine. Hi! I need to place an order. Delivery or carryout? Yeah, it needs to go to two different addresses. Is that okay? No problem. Can I get your name and phone number? Hey, you! How's it goin'? Are you ready to be distracted? I think I already am. Behold. Your distraction! Huh. I thought it'd be more shiny or something. Whatever. This is amazing. You just don't know it yet. Then by all means, amaze me. This bag was given to me by an adorable eight-year-old girl who was visiting her great-grandfather about three months ago. Mm, I see. Well, it's definitely full of magic, then. Precisely. It's a game, and the particular kind that's intended to distract you from hard things. Let's do it. Also, I have not opened this before, so there is no advantage. Mm, yeah. So you're basically telling me that you're gonna cheat again. Sore loser. Now, are you ready to lose again? You are so lucky there's this distance between us, because if not, I would kiss that smug look right off your face. You wouldn't dare. Try me. Anyway, this is a... scavenger hunt, and the first person who gets back with their item wins. What item? The one it says to find. Okay, yeah, I think I get it. Also, you have to pick a new item every time. You can't choose the same thing. Let's go. We have to find something that is shaped like a triangle. Woo! I'm back, I'm back! Oh, no! Boom, triangle. Um, that is folded! It has to actually be shaped like a triangle. True. Fine. All right, one point Kenzie. Let's go again! Woo! Somethin' sharp. Ha! I didn't even have to leave the room. Wait. Why didn't I think of that? You gotta be quicker than the master. The master of what? Uh... I'll let you know. Something that hides things. Ha! Ooh, I've been looking for that. Two, one. Chase is winning. Something teal. Whi-cha! Something expensive. Ha! Ha ha! I said something expensive. Do you have any idea what the street value of this is right now? Ug! Okay, you're right. You win. Something glittery. Something that cuts thing. Not bad. But... I'm clearly winning. Well, I have to lose sometimes, or I would never hear the end of your whining. Oh, is that so? You are by far the most amusing distraction I have ever known. Thank you. Hang on, someone's at my door. Look what was left on my doorstep! Is that pizza I smell? And it's my favorite flavor! Oh, someone's at my door. I knew you had something to do with my date. My date, my rules. Now let's see if this is as good as you claim. Oh, it's better. Just you wait. And? Mm! Who knew pineapple was this good on pizza? Um, only thousands of Canadians and Americans. Where have you been? Canadians? Whatever. No, seriously. This was invented by a guy in Canada. So, I don't know if this is my favorite. I really like artichoke hearts. But this is really good. See, now, artichokes I'll have to try? With mushrooms, it's the best. And red pepper flake. Always. You know, I couldn't eat earlier, and now I'm starvin. I kind of figured that. So, tell me something about your mom other than loving to cook. Well... she's feisty. I'm pretty sure she can take one look at Coronavirus and punch it in the throat. Then I won't worry about her. She'd also gave you the last piece of bread in the cupboard and go hungry herself. Wow. She loves to give. I'd love to meet her sometime. I think she'd like you. Really? You'd make her laugh. And laughter as what she calls good medicine. It's not good. It's the best. Hey... I just got a text from my dad. Said my mom's breathing stabilized enough that she wants to talk. Go, go. She's way more important than me. Thanks. And thank you for making me laugh. I needed it. Yeah, it was fun. Thank you. ♪ Did my wild horses leave me ♪ Leave me ♪ One thing I did not see ♪ Just me and my sight Hi, Mom. I'm heading to the store in a moment. Need some groceries? No, I don't need you to get groceries for me. I actually had a friend pick some up the other day. A friend? The friend I went on the date with. A male friend. Yes, a male friend. I'm just wondering if you even remember or think of Tanner at all anymore. Of course I still think of Tanner. It was three years of my life. Well it sure doesn't sound like it to me. For the record... I actually have a picture of him in my bedroom. That's actually reassuring. Yeah, I'm not completely hopeless, am I? Do you remember that time when we all went to Yellowstone together and we couldn't stop laughing? Yeah. Tanner was hilarious. Those skits he did around that bonfire? I don't think I've left out hard to since. Do you remember- - Mom, I can't do this. I'm sorry, I just can't. It's still too soon, dear. No, it's not too soon. I don't even cry anymore. I just need to move on. Well, if you hadn't caused that crash, we wouldn't be here, would we? I know... I'm a failure in a lot of areas of my life... but I don't need to be reminded. You know I love you. This is just hard. I gotta go. Hey, stranger! Hey, Chase. Oh. Hey, Sarah. What's up? The results came back for Mom, and it's not good. So she has it, then? Yes, she has to be in quarantine for a while. No visitors. Okay. They didn't even allow your delivery. Wait, she didn't get the flowers I sent? They aren't allowing outside deliveries of any kind. They're not even letting the delivery... This is just ridiculous now. Do you want me to send them back? No, it's it's fine. At least you got them. Chase, I can't keep them. Right, sorry. I forgot you're allergic. Okay, I will swing by and get them. Just leave them on the doorstep. Come by later? No, I'm leaving now. Love you, Chase. Love you too. What time... is it? I slept six hours. Hey, Chase. Hi! You feel better? Not really. You know when you sleep too long? Oh, yeah. I've been there. When you wake up, you don't even know what day it is. Yeah, I sort of freaked out when I woke up. Oh, look at all this beautiful food in my fridge. Hey, mine's got some too! I think I'll make a salad. Courtesy of this hunky guy I know. Hunky? I like hunky. Oh, you would. So what did you do today? Got back from work. Cleaned the balcony. Talked to my mom and pretty much cried myself to sleep. I'm sorry... What was that last part? Talked to my mom. No, after that. Did you say you cried yourself to sleep? Maybe. But sometimes I overshare, So don't put too much weight into what I say. And why would you cry yourself into a six-hour nap? Chase, are we there yet? Are we really at that point in our relationship where the random secrets just start spilling out? Are we surviving a pandemic with the world in crisis? I feel like the word floating might be more accurate than surviving. Especially on a day like today, it's like I'm just... floating through the experience. Unless you're so upset, you cry. This one really hurts. I don't know if you're ready for it. I don't think I am. Happened two years ago. Fair enough. But I wish I was there. Yeah, I wish you were too. Oh, have you been outside yet? No. Why? Stop whatever you're doing and go to your front door. Okay... Why? Don't act all suspicious. Just do it. Chase! Did you drop these off? A few hours ago. I thought they would cheer you up. And how did you know I needed cheering? Okay, I didn't. They were for my Mom, who has Coronavirus by the way. Oh, you found out today? How is she? Yeah... I mean, I guess we already knew. It just made it official. But my dad thinks that, now that she's on the ventilator, she's doing much better. Well, that's good. I'm really sorry about the no visitors thing. I know that's a pain. Yeah, apparently no flowers either. It's frustrating but... if it will keep her safe, it's worth it. Well, maybe I'll just keep them safe until she gets hom. No, no, no. You hang onto those. I'll buy my mom a bunch more when she gets out of the hospital. That sounds good. Why don't I buy a bouquet for her as well? So did it work? Are you feeling better? Strangely, yes. You ready to talk? Now we're back to me. Okay. So, I was married before. Oh. And Tanner... was my mom's favorite. I really think she wanted him to be her real child, not me or Brian. OH, come on. That can't be true. You'd think that. But the man was perfect. He was happy and helpful and always holding doors. He'd stay up late playing cards with her. Remembered her birthday. He always took her out to dinner. Wow. Yeah. For three years it's like a... a mom, like I had a living, loving mom. Can I ask what happened? Yeah. Just a sec. Take all the time you need. I was driving. When the drunk driver came into our lane, I swerved, but not fast enough. Tanner's side got most of the impact, and he died on the scene. Kenzie... I'm so sorry. I wish I could have done something more. Swerved the other way, hit the brakes. I... No, no, stop it. You can't blame yourself for something like that. I can't? My mom does. Yep. So anyway, she's upset that we're sort of seeing each other. Is that what this is? Well... technically I'm not seeing you right at this second. But... Yeah, I'd say that's what this is. I think she wants me to mourn him forever, like she's doing But it's been two years. Wouldn't she want you to move on? You'd think. Fair warning, my mother has a habit of ruining any relationship I start, and this happened way before Tanner, so... No, I don't think she wants me to move on. Then again, I don't have a normal, functioning family. I have guilt poured on guilt with a side of guilt. So, let me get this straight. Your mom calls to remind you of all the great things Tanner did and brings up that you could have saved him had you really want to? Is that the gist? Why? Cried yourself to sleep for six hours? I'm sorry, Chase. This is a lot to put on you. I did ask for it. No. I didn't have to share. All right, come with me. We're going on a field trip. We're going outside. You have a balcony or something, right? Yeah. Right now? Yup. Okay. Let me grab a jacket. Let me know when you're outside. I'm here. Okay, good. Now look up. Can you see the stars? A little bit? There's a few of 'em. Oh, man. When this thing is over, we're going on a drive to the countryside where you can really see the stars. That sounds nice. The country, the stars. You. Chase, what if this doesn't work out? What if we take one look at each other in person and... and it's just not there, you know? Then it isn't. That's what I'm afraid of. No You're afraid of what will happen when there is something there. Am I? That's the hard part about falling in love. The leap. When it's real. You are so poetic. It could turn a girl's head. Ha ha. You mock now, but you'll see. No, I mean it. You have this incredible philosophy on life, this leap and see if you get burned but take the chance anyway. How you do it? How do I decide that the risk is worth the fall? Yeah. Do you have a defining moment? My best friend, Hayden. What happened? Well... He ran off with my fiance. Oh. And all the money in our business account. The business that we created just out of college. A thriving, booming, new-age tech company that saw more clients than we knew what to do with. He and Angela left me with all the bills, all the debts, and all the disappointment. I was not expecting to hear that. Yeah. Defining moments aren't always pretty. In fact, most of them happen once you hit rock bottom and have nowhere else to go. And after all of that, you're still willing to date again? I'd hope so. I hope I wouldn't be so jaded to naturally assume every woman would treat me the sam. Did I scare you off? No, I'm just thinking, taking it all in. Man... Now I'm the one turning into the pumpkin. Would you forgive me if I hung up soon? Yeah, of course. No, you go to bed. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to sleep, but I'll try. You should We've got a hot date tomorrow night. Oh really? After the last few days, we need to do something a lot less gloomy. I agree. Goodnight, Chase.

I... I'm sorry. I did not know you were... Holy crap! You are even prettier in person. Um... Yeah, hello. Hi. I'm not leaving. Don't ask me to leave. I can't. We can't. Can we just go to the park? And sit, and talk, human to human? I guess so. Okay. I have this for you. I had a painting night planned but... Just, here, hang onto it, save it for a rainy day. I will take your trash and take it out for you and meet you downstairs. Yeah. Awesome. Great. Gosh. I cannot believe you're really here, that this is really happening. Weren't we just talking about this? Yes. When does this thing get lifted again? Like how many more weeks? Oh, I don't know. I think there were a couple of states that were lifted last month. What? Where? Let's go! I think that defeats the purpose. Not when I want to kiss you so bad right now. Chase. What? Had this been a real relationship and we'd been on as many dates as we have, we would have kissed by now. Are you sure about that? Kenzie... Yes? Now is not the time for smug comments. It is taking every ounce of my control to sit here and not kiss your perfect face. How do you know I want to be kissed. So, since our paint date is out, I was thinking we could exchange embarrassing storie. Oh, I'm not ready for that. That's the best part about embarrassing stories. You're never ready for them. I was really, really awkward as a teenager. Oh, it couldn't have been any worse than me. Doubt it. In high school, I told my friend Catherine which guy on the soccer team I liked. Okay. She literally pushed me into him as the team was jogging by. Eight of them fell on top of us! And to make matters worse, he thought I did it on purpose and was really upset with me. So you guys totally dated. Yeah, no. We never spoke again. Okay, I once tripped over a girl's dress at prom, stepped on it with one foot, tripped over with the other, ripped the whole thing. I still don't think she's ever forgiven me for that. Yeah, those dresses are expensive. I never lived it down. How old were you when you first kissed someone? Um... 14. Summer camp. What about you? 17. But it should have been in when I was 15. So, this guy met me before school. He'd practically bathed in Scope. So I knew he was gonna try something. But I didn't know the etiquette or the technique. So he's getting closer and closer to my face, and I'm looking for words to say, and I don't know what to say, so I opened my mouth and I... mooed like a cow. I'm sorry, you... mooed? Yeah. Okay, you win the awkward contest. Could I hear your moo? No. When can I see you again? Tomorrow? I mean, maybe not here, but I'd love to talk tomorrow. Done. You're even more fun to talk to in person. So are you. I'm surprised, actually. About how well we work? Yeah. But for the record... I... wish I could kiss you too. What? Wait! Let's take our chances! No! It'll happen, eventually. That's okay. Goodnight, Chase. Talk to you later. Goodnight. Hey, Brian. Thanks for calling me back. So give me the skinny on Tanner. I want to hear the good, the bad, and the ugly. Was Kenzie's husband really as amazing as I hear? Why you asking me? You're her brother. You're the only one who's gonna tell me the truth. So you know those larger-than-life Hallmark movie guys? Yeah. That was Tanner, practically perfect in every way. Wow. So he's the real deal. Dude! How am I supposed to measure up to that? You like Kenzie, don't you? Yeah, I do. I like her a lot? You've got it bad. You think I have a chance? If you can get past my mom, yes, definitely. Your mom? What does that mean? Hi, Mom. Are you still seeing Chase Montgomery? Yes, I am. Why? You have no idea who he is! What do you mean? I bet he's never even told you about his failed business and the thousands he owes! I know about his first business. But why do you know about it? Did you Google him? You promised you wouldn't do that anymore. This is fraud, Kenzi! You have to listen to me. Look, his business partner left him with nothing, and he worked for years to pay everyone back. There was no fraud. I've got proof. From what websites did you get proof? And more importantly, Mom, why? Because I will always look out for my children. Okay. Look... this isn't okay. None of it. You've gotta stop trying to ruin every good thing in my life. You remember you didn't even like Tanner when you first met him? This has nothing to do with Tanner right now. I've heard about the police report too. What do you mean there's a police report? Chase Montgomery is bad news, Kenzie. Just stay away from him. Check your email. I'm sending you some links you need to read. Okay. Talk to you later, Mom. You need to know the truth. Hello? Is this Chase Montgomery? I'm sorry, who is this? Kenzie's mother. We need to talk. Kenzie's mom! Uh... Well, what a surprise. Did Kenzie give you my number? My son shared your number with me. Of course Brian did. What can I do for you? I'd like to discuss your failed business and the fraudulent charges laid at your feet. Have you spoken to Kenzie about this yet? Of course I have. I wouldn't keep her in the dark. I see. I know all about you. How dare you attempt to have a relationship with my daughter, when all you care about is yourself! I've read the website. I know all about everything. If you just give me- - How dare you! Just give me a minute, please! Obviously you came to share your piece, and I respect that, however- - You better stay away from my daughter! However... Kenzie is a grown woman who can make her own adult choices. And in this instance, I'm gonna refer to her. If you think I'll put up with any of this! Excuse me, ma'am. - Your are a disgusting... - Ma'am... - Worthless piece of- - Ma'am excuse me! I respect Kenzie, and I wouldn't do anything to harm her. Nothing, including what you suggest. Now, I suggest that you go check your source on my history and get your facts straight. Old blogs written by my former business partner don't count. I don't believe a word you've said. Well, I'll tell you right now I am an honest, hardworking man, and I deserve none of this. Don't you try to con me! Bye. Hey. Hey. I just thought I'd let you know I got a call from your mom today. How bad was it? It was pretty bad. I'm so sorry, Chase. I was pretty blindsided by the whole thing. It takes some serious to chew a man out like that. I'll give her that much. Yeah, you didn't deserve it. I just want to ask you one thing. Do you believe what she said about me? The fraudulent stuff? I don't want to. I told her it wasn't true. But... I've sitting here letting my doubts get the best of me. Well... I guess that's the answer I needed. Chase. Have a good one. I'll see you later. But our date. Wow. ♪ I'm a lost puzzle piece ♪ Without the picture on the cover of the box ♪ ♪ If you don't know what it looks like ♪ ♪ You can't know where it fits ♪ Do you think you'll find the place in your heart ♪ ♪ I'm a little rest stop ♪ On your road trip to adventure ♪ ♪ Or was I intended to be the destination ♪ ♪ Did you throw the map away ♪ I'm waitin' for you ♪ You take your sweet time ♪ But one day you'll run out of this words to rhyme ♪ ♪ I'm waitin' for you ♪ To make up your mind ♪ 'Cause I've already made mine ♪ I haven't heard from him in days, Brian. I... think this is Mom's most impressive record yet. I tried to warn him about her. I know. It's not fair. Do you think theres any chance you can fix it? No. I don't think it's repairable? How could it be? I don't know. Mom's been known to say some nasty stuff. Yeah, it's just... It's too much. Mom, why are you calling me? We need to talk. No, we don't! I've gotta go. I told you, we have nothing to discuss. Kenzie, this is important! You're not ready for a relationship. Mom... I love Chase. I do. He's amazing, and I'm really glad I met him. If you ever want to meet him, I need two things from you. No! I know you showed me the websites were false- - Mom, two things. One... stop it. I am an adult, I am allowed to live my life, and you don't have a right to say anything about it. And, two... I love you, but I don't need this. So if you're gonna continue to be mean and spiteful, then you're gonna lose me too. And, three... Don't you ever call Chase like that again! If you have something that's not appropriate or nice to say, them just don't. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm bringing happiness back into my life. So... I've gotta go. I love you But he's not the one! I'm telling you! How've you been? I'm good. How's your mom? You kinda left me hanging, and I've been worried sick. She's better. Definitely on the mend. Doctors thinks she might even be able to come home this weekend. That is wonderful! Why didn't you tell me? I know. I'm sorry. Chase? What happened? Honestly... I guess I panicked. I couldn't imagine us trying to have a relationship without trust. That isn't what I meant. Yeah, I realize that now. I probably realized it then too, but I was just too upset to tell. It hurt. It really hurt. I know. And that's why I wanted to chat and say sorry. Well, I'm sorry my mom told you off. You definitely didn't deserve that. Well, you did tell me your family was dysfunctional. I just didn't realize to what extent until then. Yeah. It's always been weird. She just has to have everything her way. But I think this virus has a way of bringing the worst out of people. It's like they have too much time to mull stuff over. Yeah. I can see that. Are you okay? If I was half the man I pretended to be, I would have asked you that question every night. I'm okay. I actually... had it out with my mom today. I'm not sure what the repercussions will be, but... I think it's worth it. Set some boundaries. Yeah, I told her I'm an adult, and if she wants to have anything to do with me, then she better let me live my life. Bravo. That needed to be said. Yeah, for a long time. Turns out boundaries are a good thing. So, as much fun as it is talking about your mom... I really came here to ask you one thing. Can you forgive me? I love you. I'm sorry... What was that? I said I love you. I'm coming over. Chase, you can't! Watch me. I can't let you in. You said you love me. Do you have a fever? Chase, I'm not delusion or anything. No, I'm being serious. Do you have a fever? No! Have you had a fever in the last two weeks or any COVID-19 symptom for that matter? No, or I wouldn't be allowed to go to work. Well, neither have I, which means we are both well enough for essential jobs and to go to stores and things, right? Well, yeah. Good. Because I have something very essential to do right now. When the love bomb is dropped, it is essential that you kiss. What are we going to do now? Well, I still have a list of dates we haven't been on. I like that. Or we could keep kissing. 'Cause I'm okay with that too. I bet. I do have to go back into quarantine tomorrow for my job. Yeah. The old people need you. But, why don't we have dinner? I know a little bistro. It's called my balcony. Oh, I have I've read about that. Uh-huh. I've always wanted to try that place. Good reviews. Um... You know, I know where you Chinese place that delivers this time. Hm! Perfect. You mean we're not gonna do our own cooking show today? Oh, no.
