HODU&U PICTURES SHOWBOX presents a HODU&U PICTURES / SHOWBOX production Executive produced by KIM Do-soo, HWANG Soon-il Produced by LEE Jeong-eun, KWON So-eun, KIM Do-soo Did you swap the tires? The grip feels too weak. Thanks for coming. Yes, I had to. The police commissioner was at the track that day. Mr. Choi! He took bribes... from JC's Jung Jae-chul, and a video of their exchange exists. So... Buster. The dash cam on your company's concept car. That's all we need. There will be no record, and we could offer you witness protection too. Okay? Where's the dash cam files? There has to be a back up. Back up? I want to know that too. - Hey! - Do you know where you are? - Do you? - Take it easy. Dash cams don't make back ups... Could I... get some juice? Jesus Christ! I'll grind you up in a juice mixer. - We shouldn't mess up. - Internal affairs is a joke. Calm down. Desperate for another internal investigation? Gosh... Keep it together. What's with you? Hey! Mr. Jung isn't someone you can deal with. Shit! Goddammit! Dude! Call 911! KONG Hyo-Jin RYU Jun-yeol CHO Jung-seok YUM Jung-ah JEON Hye-Jin SON Seok-koo KIM Ki-bum LEE Sung-wook PARK Ye-Yung and LEE Sung-min Directed by HAN Jun-hee HIT-AND-RUN SQUAD Breaking News. We've obtained a video of JC Motors' CTO Choi Kyung-joon attempting to commit suicide during interrogation. JC Motors, which is being accused of bribing high ranking public officials, is owned by Korea's first F1 racer Jung Jae-chul, and is expanding its business to performance cars and race tracks. The prosecution is denying their involvement with this case. I'm borrowing your car. What? Did you say something? - Open this door! - Move out of the way! - Don't! - What's with you all? Good morning. What's going on? Let me through. Move, move. Deputy Eun. My apologies, but we need your laptop... You shouldn't touch it. Investigator Lim. Were we close enough to mince words? What the prosecution is trying... Is police at the mercy of the prosecution? Good morning, sir. - Prosecutor Ki. - Sorry I'm late. I couldn't get a cab. - Go finish up outside. - Yes, sir. So how's Choi? Didn't hit an artery. He should be okay. Is this JC's doing? They probably planned and executed the incident, and sent the press at the right time. Faking a medical report doesn't even work for them. Give me your laptop first. Jung Jae-chul, that sly piece of shit. He hit us when I slept a wink after 4 days. Perfect timing, isn't it? I know. He knows his shit. But your laptop... }No! Stop! Sorry about that. Try to understand. Come get the car later. What happened? Is she nuts?! Remember what you said? JC's Jung Jae-chul is paying off the commissioner? You said there's dash cam evidence. Buster or whatever! You said you could charge the commissioner, so I even created a special task force. This is your best? Who am I to put blame? Again! Commander, I was responsible... Deputy Chief Eun. My apologies. Can't bother to see your boss get the beating? It tears you up? Goddammit. Commissioner Park... Not gonna salute? You gave your best, but failed. What will you do? I'll resign, sir. As of now, internal affairs is reassigned. It's all tainted. This is the work of planning division. There's no one to trust. When did we start this case? One year ago? As of today, 371 days. Aren't you tired? How could I be? Thinking of those who were let go... Detective Kang, Kim, Sang-ho, Min-joo... Yeah, this place used to be packed. What will you do now? JC has an Italian loan account under the commissioner's name. Why not leak that? Once that's exposed, JC will buy up all newspaper ads. With the prosecution pulling out, we can't get anyone without the dash cam. Neither the commissioner or Jung Jae-chul. Korea's rotten to hell. Stupid dash cam... But first... I begged my friend at HR for this favor. - Transfer Notice: Hit-and-Run Department - You could've been demoted. "Hit-and-run department?" Chief... You think it's a demotion? Look at the big picture. And I'm not asking you to handle some hit-and-runs. What a joke. You know we're short-staffed, and you sent him where?! Hello? Hello? Station chief? You moron! I'm sick of this! Hey, don't smoke there! Excuse me. Is the chief not here? You're Eun Si-yeon, aren't you? Not gonna salute me? Salute. Good to meet you. Come sit down. At ease. Western district traffic chief, Woo Sun-young. Welcome. Never seen a pregnant cop? Not at all. We're busy, so let's skip the intro, and start gluing. Is there anyone else here? We got you. If you're from the internal, you must know Ji-hyun. Yes, you know Chief Yoon? Graduated the academy together. FYI, I was the class ace. I'm serious. Chief, we got a hit-and-run, Jangchun junction. - Is Min-jae out there? - Yes, ma'am. - Did you drive here? - Yes. Pick up Min-jae and get to the crime scene. Min-jae, Jangchun junction. - What are you waiting for? Need a hug? - No, ma'am. It's your first hit-and-run, so follow Min-jae's lead, He's our ace. Move! Move! Holy shit! - Help me take this off, it won't come off! - Come on! Could you pull it? This ain't easy. Where are my glasses? Here they are. I found them. Salute, Officer Suh Min-jae. - An officer is the ace? - Dunno about an ace, but I sure am an officer. Need a mask? The scene could be bad, you can use this. Where's the scene? You drive. I'll input the GPS. What do I press? This car's too fancy. Seat-belt. What's that stench? It's a mixture of gasoline and blood. Hit-1 at the scene. I'll call you back. - Did you have lunch, Min-jae? - Hey. Had some rolls... - Did you bring a bag? - Bag? For what? So you don't barf at the scene again. No, I quit barfing. Hello there. Who's this? I'm new, Eun Si-yeon. Ah, wait, just a sec. I'm an insurance investigator, Jang Hyung-gwan. I used to be in a hit-and-run squad. - Sir, move your tow truck. - Hey, bud! - He listened to police radio again. - Blame my amazing intuition. I did come way too quickly. I have to wait 20 minutes! Stick to your service center and don't take kickbacks. - I know, I know. - What happened here? - You can't come in. - Let me see! It's not an insurance scam. Head back to the office. I better. I gotta talk to his family about the claim. - Call me! - Okay. See you around. Delete the pictures. Are they all your friends? Well, I see them often. I see. Cab driver dozing off? Yeah, that's plausible. It's a pileup. The victim's sight was blocked. This is Lieutenant Eun Si-yeon. Could you verify security cam footage? - Hey. - Hi. How's the victim? We got here late and the taxi driver is unconscious. I'll take a look. - I requested cam footage... - It's salty... salty? Salt... Cams 41 and 31 are busted and this junction is a blind spot. - Then check dash cams nearby? - Salt? Yup. What? His mental state is off when he's on duty. That seems to be the problem. Collision #1... #2... This is #3. Fish transport truck. That's the answer. This is corroded by salt. Seawater over here and the salt on that man's soles. - Hey. - Yes? Do you always investigate without protocol? We're so short-staffed and lack time... So you just make assumptions? Of course not. No, but that's how we... How sure are you? 100%. That'd be presumptuous. Very presumptuous. I'll go with 99%. 100%, it's the perpetrator's vehicle. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Did you skip lunch? Why have rolls? - Want some? - Tuna rolls? Here. - It's mine. - You offered! Put on your seat-belt. Suspect's vehicle confirmed. Fish transport truck up ahead. Gents, let's begin. Everyone spread out and secure your position. Cruiser 1, moving to target's right side. 039, slow down and come to a stop! Sir! He's unlikely to stop. Stop the car at once! Cover him from both sides, be careful! Dang, he must be drunk. Let's lead him to the divider. Copy! We'll force him to slow down! Attempting to box him in! Back him up from behind! Slow down to 20 km/h. Okay, okay, everyone stop! Get out of the vehicle! Hey! Stop! - Hey! - Stop it! You okay? He's taking off! Go away! Hurry! Stop! Stop! Stop! I didn't mean to kill him! I was late for a vendor meeting... He's dead. A man is dead. He really died? Hey. Let me see. I'm fine. I'm really okay. I'm... Good work. - I'll do it. - It's fine. - Get the chopsticks. - Where's the kimchi? - At the bottom. - Bottom where? Very bottom. We shouldn't be eating ramen. What an extravagant welcoming party. Daily expense limit is $20. Get receipts. No, it's okay... If you don't take it, it's embezzlement for me. - Okay. - Looks delicious. - Any updates on Chungra case? - Chungra? - You know, in front of JC F1 track. - Right, JC. Initial tipster disappeared and the scene has been wiped clean. - JC as in JC Motors? - Yeah. Three months ago, we got a hit-and-run report. But the witness called back and retracted his report. So we got there late, and got no evidence. No victim report, nada. We did get a fragment, but it can't be traced. Traced? Every scene of accident has fragments, from headlights or bumper paint chips. We use those to analyze car maker and color. But we're clueless on this car. It could be a special car or a concept car. Concept car? I'll dig into the insurance. You went to same high school as Jung Jae-chul, right? Yeah, where's my car? Bring back my car before I call the police. Consider it your punishment. I just did my job. But I'm really sorry. It's not your fault you're a powerless desk jockey. - You need me as the desk jockey to do your job on the field. - Whatever. Come out. I'm picking you up. What is it? Hello? What the shit... I'm no idiot who does what I'm told. Are you going somewhere? Do you even know where we are? You take me for an idiot? Why are you putting me in a tough spot? Always the same excuse. - You love this. - Absolutely. Is this allowed? You're going solo. Did you check with the chief? It's too late to back out. Man up, idiot. Don't call me that. Let's do this. May I see your invitation? - Thank you, this way please. - Okay. So fancy. This place is pumping. Jung Jae-chul skipped our investigation to get a psych evaluation. This is his party. Yeah, better to be here. I wish Buster's here too. What do I do now? Excuse me. Excuse me? What? Your mommy's car? What? Is that your m-m-mommy's car? - What's he saying? - Is he nuts? Why doesn't the light change? Don't look at him. He's crazy. It sure looks like your mommy's car. Buddy, get out. - Baby, let it go! - Hold on, get off me! Goddamn son of a bitch! - Just let it go. - What the hell, man! What the hell?! Hey, hey, hey! Hey... Excuse me...! Here, if it's yours, then you do it too. Total this piece of shit. Sucks to be you. That's not Buster. - Hi! - Sweetie, I thought you were sick. You okay? M-my ride's sick. - Stop showing up on nightly news. - Having fun? Stop looking at him like you're here to arrest him. - Let's get a drink. - Drink with us. Yeah, maybe later. - Let's go. - Yeah, see you in a bit. Here he comes. - What's this? - Your job tonight. - Good evening, Prosecutor Ki. - Evening. Thank you f-f-for looking after Choi. Not at all, I was doing what I was told. JC owes the prosecutor's office. This is our alum, and she wanted to come and broaden her network. Nice to meet you. I heard so much about you. From whom? - Was that too cliché? - A little bit. - I bet nothing good though. - Only the good stuff. Sure. - I'll see you in a bit. - Certainly. I peed a little. Am I done? This is just the beginning. Where are you taking me? Shut up and get in. What is it? I always wanted to do this. Nervous? A bit. - Chairman. - It works. Everyone's here? My apologies. Look at the time. I'm sorry, I'm late. That's all? No wonder self-made men are still peasants. You were just a chauffeur abroad and we made you into a tycoon. Don't you feel sorry for Ho-sik? He vouched for you. Is that a smirk? He smirked at me. I didn't even know he was an alum. Listen, buddy. We may be alums but on different levels. - Know what I'm saying? - Yeah, I'm on a different level. Who here has m-made his own money and drives his own car? Just me. I thought he was crazy for cars but he's just crazy. - Sir, let's first... - Ho-sik, sit. They're debt settlement agreements. It's time to c-collect everything you borrowed. P-p-please sign. Is this petty chauffeur threatening me? He is... There was a rumor that he fixed races with mafia in Italy. He really is a thug. The track isn't even finished, so take this shit and shove it up... It doesn't b-break. G-get me a helmet and a drill. Jae-chul, what are you doing? S-speak another word and I'll cut your daddy's dick off. }Gentlemen, do you know where my stutter came from? Remember, Ho-sik? When I was in grade school, my dad was your dad's chauffeur. I was burning up with chickenpox, and my dad rushed to your place to borrow your dad's shitty car. Do you know what your dad said? “Buses are still running. I'm just saying. You're so right! I was in league with mafia and gamblers in Italy, and they bet a ton of money and fixed races with drivers. What happens when I lose? Everyone gets fucked! You hear me, assholes?! If you can't pay, there's a list of tasks in the back, not easy nor hard. Your parents are all involved in politics. So I'm begging you, like I did in high school. Hello? Can you hear me? Lieutenant Eun Si-yeon? This way please. Prosecutor Ki, a drink? Champagne? Happy? This bitch's got no manner. How about a bitch slap? Try it. Invitation... Don't have one, I just need to talk to Mr. Jung. - This is a private party... - Is it because I ate this? - Caterers shoved it to me. - What is it now? - I just need a moment. - What the hell... Mr. Jung? Are you Jung Jae-chul? - Who...? - I'm actually... - We'll take care of... - Stay back. I'm Officer Suh Min-jae from Incheon Western district. We're having an event, so could you get to the point? I called to get to the point but I couldn't reach you. You know my number? I checked JC's homepage and a number was listed. So I called and I guess you didn't get my message. As per protocol, if I can't reach someone after 20 calls, I can seek them out in person. So I called, how many times? 23 times? Quite a bit, actually. That's why I came here, and I know it's inconvenient... It does feel quite inconvenient. About 3 months ago, there was a hit-and-run. I see. There was a witness who called the police. He received a large sum from your insurance company. $100,000. But he wasn't insured. You can't just crash a private party... I had this weird thought in my head. Whether it was a personal or corporate decision, he was paid off to keep his mouth shut. I could be crossing the line with that thought. Crossing the line, indeed. Got any evidence to back that up? Evidence? If I had any, I'd be taking you in. - But since I don't... - I feel terrible since it happened in front of our tracks... I only mentioned hit-and-run, but nothing about the track. How did you...? You're right. How many lawyers we got? Nine, including our legal division and lawyers on retainer. Is there a-anything else we need to discuss? It doesn't have to be today, but if you think of anything at all, if something suddenly pops up in your head, call me here. You know, like truth that can't be seen. What you see is the truth. It'd be great if you call me. - You know him? - That idiot... Have fun today! I'll see myself out. He's the one. Clear the road. I need a breather. Why take that? Get in. Eh? What are you doing here? I was surprised to see you! - When I saw you back there... - Say hello to my informant. - Hello, I'm her informant. - Hello, Mr. Informant. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. Why are you flying solo without reporting? I'm sorry, it's a habit to do things on my own. Why stay in the force then? You can do your thing on your own. There isn't anything else I want to do... Hey. Going in head-on seems to be your style, but be mindful of the target, and don't ruin the investigation. Can't you differentiate big and small cases? Are you listening? I'm sorry. Does size matter during investigation? Rather than the size... I'm sorry. Where are you two going? Hello? I gotta take this, hello? Did you get the photo I sent? Photo, yes. I'll be there in a bit, could you verify it? I'm on my way, so please verify it ASAP. Bye. Officer Suh, you gotta report. Report! These are Jung Jae-chul's parked cars, and the headlight gloss looked similar to the accident fragments. Since I only have suspicion, I wanted to get an expert opinion. Expert? Automotive Mechanic Industries Thank you. See you. - The expert's here? - Yup, he's here. Why won't it come off? Dad- Dad! Don't sleep here. You'll injure your neck. Don't send me stuff at night! This isn't forensics center! Hello, I'm Lieutenant Eun Si-yeon. Salute! - Photo analysis first! - Sure, sure! - Your father? - Yes, he's not a weirdo. There's less gloss on these. Oh yeah? Look. - See the numbers? - Very similar. Exactly the same. One's a fragment and the photo's from tonight? Is this Japanese? Good guess, you bastard, and I do all the hard work. I'm okay. Japanese import, Mazoka Systems. This is exported to Europe, almost the cost of a Korean car. Hold on, let's say the perpetrator's car is a JC concept car, and if it has the same headlights as Jung Jae-chul's car... Jung Jae-chul is the perpetrator. Idiot! That's hardly enough for a report! What you got is all circumstantial. Right. Delivery! - Hello! Oh, you're here, too? - Hello! Did your ambulance break down on the way? I got goosebumps... The engine sounds awful. Let me take a look. - No, have dinner first. - Sure, sure... Tell your hubby I can see his red head from here. Get in here, moron! Come on, man. Let him off the hook this time. I gave him a beating. Did you get in trouble again? I really didn't know. He started working with those guys who refurbish totaled cars and got caught again. You bastard! You want to go that low?! Is there a party here? The neighbors get together and eat often. - And... work out. - Prison is no big deal. - Welcome. - You all are too loud. - You're here? - I'm here. Get up, prep the table! You guys still working? - I'll do it. - Did you come empty-handed? Can you stay for dinner? You really eat well. Who? Me? If it's using Mazoka parts, isn't it for racing? He drives that? That's nuts. A car is a weapon. It's an open secret. It's a miracle that we're alive. It wouldn't surprise me if any one of us got mangled tomorrow. Come on, sir, we're eating here. - Be careful, asshole. - Sure thing. Oh yeah, Min-jae's thing. What? - Here. - What is it? I bought it when we went to the outlet mall. We missed your birthday. You didn't have to. Change the size and you wear it. Don't you dare! Toss those raggedy clothes! We see you wear it every day, so do us a favor. I know... Do I stink? You can't smell? Dirty bastard, you stink like hell! You stink more! Smell yourself! He stinks more! Hey. Thank you, I'll buy you a pack later. Officer Suh and his father are so similar in every way. The way they talk is the same, too. That's the power of DNA, I guess. Min-jae's not his biological son. It's not a secret. He was adopted about ten years ago. They're so similar since they're always together. He was a speedster straight out of orphanage, and muled drugs with his car. Then he got into a big accident with a cop who was chasing him. If it wasn't for that, no one would have caught him. He's too fast. The cop who got hurt was Mr. Suh. He was hospitalized for weeks. Doctor said there was no hope. He quit the force and started this garage with Min-jae. Life is funny. I'm off. Take him inside, it's cold. - Don't be late tomorrow. - Good night! - Bye. - Salute! Dad. Dad? Oh, daddy, daddy... - Hold on! I gotta go! Sorry, Min-jae. - Okay, see you later. - Leaving? - Of course. - I'm sorry. - You should be! - That hurts. - Snap out of it. Shoes, shoes, please! - Isn't this my wife? - I sure am. Give me that. You should head home. - Almost done. - It's okay. Can I ask you something? Ask away. Of all things, why police? Placed first on recruitment test but failed the interviews, and even after becoming one, you don't get promoted. People keep speaking behind your back. So why? None of that matters. "Do you think people can change?" My dad asked me in front of the juvenile detention. "If so," "redeem yourself, together." Someone like me can't exist again. Keep everyone out. Goddammit! Commish Park! Can you d-d-do anything right? That small cop is in my way. It hurts, huh? So why did you keep the dash cam footage of me? That's my insurance, s-so you do your job. Look up there. Chairman. I can crucify you like him there. - So... - Become a politician and a m-m-mayor too. Who will front you that money? Goddamn beggar. Stop bitching at me and do your d-d-damn job. I'll call it a day. Chairman. Put more men on the internal affairs bitches. Yes, sir. - Salute. - Brief us. I looked into Jung Jae-chul's insurance through Hyung-gwan. Aside from the witness, they paid off someone else. - So I... - What's his name? - Choi Young... - Choi Kyung-joon. He was on the news recently, Jung Jae-chul's underling. Right, Choi Kyung-joon. Have some coffee. Nice to meet you. }I'm Officer Suh Min-jae from Incheon Western police. You got a lot of luggage for a 4-day trip. I sure do, why's that your business? Well, you pretty much have 1 luggage per day... I'm really sorry, but my flight leaves soon. You got travel banned. You're not flying today. There was a hit-and-run at 2AM on the 24th, three months ago at Chungra junction. Don't know. I really don't. - I'm sorry. - No need to be sorry. But you'll be in big trouble. Not answering it? I focus only on work when I'm on duty. So what do we do? If that's the case, could you write every bad things you did since birth? What's going on here? For example, your wound on your hand, or traces of cocaine on your nose, and that weed strain between your teeth. But nothing like buying Aspirin at the pharmacy. Write everything you did wrong in your life. There isn't any glass to cut your wrist with here. Just paper cups, no distractions whatsoever. Write whatever comes to mind. You had many chances to go but never actually did, right? Go where? Prison. Immensely diverse group of people are there. But they all cry at night. Why? Upset, sad, scared, and homesick. Nothing but the sound of sobs. A sea of sobs... Mr. Choi! Long drive, right? It wasn't a short drive. - That day... - Shall we walk? The commissioner was at the track to meet Mr. Jung. The commissioner? This isn't amusing. So I have to come in person to take your money? Don't put it like that, Commissioner Park. I wanted to see you too. - It's not a petty sum. - Chairman. You're loaded. Commissioner. Do you know where you're standing? This was my room. A very friggin small room. When I was in middle school, my d-d-dad hung himself. Right over there. My mom hung there. Here, here and here, seizure s-s-stickers everywhere. They hung from the ceiling. Now it's all ours. Thanks to your skills and my money. We can't be buried here. You became a gangster while I've been busy. When someone doesn't know you, he'd take you for one too. Take care. When the hell... Do I kill him? Mr. Jung is an extremely animalistic man. He sometimes feels like a kid... He defies logic and common sense. I'll be on public roads, get the traffic lights ready. Yes, sir. It's fine to drive it but you can't drive it like a race. I hear you, Choi. Chairman, sir! Help me... Okay, where's Buster now? He's hosting a street race on public roads tonight. He usually drives Buster there, but won't race it. Prosecutor Ki, welcome. What's going on? You two? Hey. Good to go? Really? … transferred to hit-and-run squad... Chief... But this is... Did someone tell you to investigate hit-and-run? This is Buster. So Jung Jae-chul did this. This is all. The witness retracted his call six minutes after that. And we came across that footage by intelligence division. We were lucky. Incheon's hit-and-run squad is on the case. So I'm to get Buster's dash cam under pretense of this transfer? Now you're getting it? We need evidence of officials taking bribes from Jung Jae-chul. Understood. Still can't reach Si-yeon? She said she went to meet her informant, then nothing. Did she fall in love with the informant or something? Let's go over one last time. Reason for not ambushing them? Too many variables to ambush right away. It'd be convenient for us if he drove Buster to the race. Okay. If Jung Jae-chul follows the schedule as Choi mentioned... He'll be in our region at midnight. We'll need to catch him before then. As you see here, this is where they race. I'm concerned about this area. - Here. - The tunnel? We don't have enough men to cover that. I can go. Yeah, sure. Be careful. What's up? They can't make it? Yeah, they got work all of sudden. Don't worry, they're both professionals. Like hell they are. He's still a kid. - I'm here. - Look at that sour expression. What is it now? Yeo-Jung's ambulance broke down again. I gotta eat fast and go. Punk, I told you the engine needed work many times. Stop eating and bring it back. I'm going! I was gonna go to Seoul for a big job. I don't believe this... Forget it, you brat, I'll go myself. Really? You will? I'll be back shortly, so don't devour everything. Want me to come with you? Forget it. Really? I love you! I really do, sir! We love you! Nice! Thanks for helping out. Internal affairs is amazing. When did you even get this car? And why am I here? Here to love you. Shut the hell up. Don't stop after the race, and never take your helmet off. You be careful. I'm off. I'm in. We're up and running. Let's do this right. Go hard. So many lunatics... Station chief sent the case to the HQ. Come back for now- - I'll get to the scene on my own. - Like hell you will. It'll be dangerous with Jung Jae-chul's men. Danger is a risk that all cops accept. Don't do anything by yourself again! Listen to me for once! - I'll call you right back! - Min-jae! Hey, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Okay! Evening. - Incheon Western district, Officer Suh. - I'm a little busy. Is that so? There's an emergency here. I'll check right away and send you off. - Buddy. - Yes? - He's coming. - He's here! A Korean challenger? With Korean wheels? Buster has arrived. Copy. Arrogant bastard. You better be Schumacher. Don't need it. I'm cool, so cool. If you have Buster's location, secure Jung Jae-chul's fingerprint. - What happened? - Is he dead? - He's moving. - He's still alive! Hey poser, you made it too obvious. You know better not to shift like that. Prosecutor Ki? Where's your bitch? What? You're so screwed, stuttering psycho prick. - Are you okay, sir? - Shit, buster... Dash cam secured. - Ki is injured. Please call 119. - Okay, we're on it. What the... Good to see you, ma'am. You're under arrest for violating department rules. Please get out of the car. Captain? Captain? I should've slapped her into next week. Sir, how long will it take? We'll be there shortly. We're close. Why are they in such a rush? What the hell. Goddammit! Get her. Help her out first. Get her out. - Sir... - Yeo-Jung, can you move? Buster, Buster... Hold onto me. I'll be right back. Sir... Dad. Took you long enough! Get out of there! Dad! Shit... Is he dead? - Mr. Jung! - Mr. Jung! Are you all right? You can't be seen here... - Get Buster. - We'll get Buster. Okay. - Clean up the mess. - Yes, sir. Wait... Wait a minute. Wait... Damn you! Son of a bitch! We'll leave now. H-Hold on... That's enough. Crazy bastard... Did you kill him? Stop it, Min-jae. You can't kill him. Kim Min-jae? You're Kim Min-jae? You confessed to everything? Drug dealing and smuggling. You were the mastermind of it all? You're the boss? I don't buy that. Why'd the boss not flee then? You had plenty of time. And why call 119 and pull me out of the car? I lost a leg thanks to you. I can't run now. Can't catch guys like you anymore. But... I'd be dead if it wasn't for you. Thanks, for saving me. Bastard. We'll now begin Seoul Metro Police disciplinary hearing. Captain Yoon Ji-hyun present for the hearing. Lieutenant Eun Si-yeon present for the hearing. Do you admit to voluntarily planning and executing an unauthorized operation? - I do. - I do. According to Criminal Code 123, dismissal or demotion is justified. But you are here today as witnesses to more pressing issue. Defendant, come in. The hearing of Commissioner Park over bribery and abuse of authority will now begin... Excuse me. I've seen the footage, and it was indeed me. What are you doing? You gals won. What to do with Jung Jae-chul? He came out before the due date. I could've delivered at the station if I wasn't suspended. I'm sorry, I should've visited you earlier. It's okay, I'm sure returning to HQ was no joke. Did you see Min-jae? Not yet. I feel bad... - Ma'am, due to the dash cam... - Si-yeon. Honestly, this isn't easy for me. You're sorry and pissed. Am I right? I know you're not a bad person, but I still can't forgive you. At least not now. Min-jae's having a tough time. He won't answer his phone. I don't know what he's thinking. Dad... Son! Keep redeeming yourself! It's been a while. - You're home late. - Why are you here? Did we ever need a reason to meet? Suh Min-jae got suspended and Jung Jae-chul will go free. - Did you know? - I didn't. I found out recently. You're proud of that fact? I risked my neck for you, and this is your best? Jung Jae-chul, the bastard, got a summary offense because there's no evidence. He's checking into an American hospital. In California. It's all over once he gets on that plane. We didn't get everything, but it's a blow to Jung Jae-chul... Rationalize all you want. Hey. Are you the Eun Si-yeon I know? Take this. Chief Yoon tossed this, but I don't know what it is. Burn it or toss, pour coffee on it. Do what you will. Go and don't come back. I didn't free you so you can have fun. My new partner! Welcome. You look too normal for someone who'll be admitted. I just have to put on a good show at the prosecutor's office tomorrow. Where's the list? I'll hand it over when I'm admitted. You're a tough chick. Keep your promise. Sure, you go get bad guys and become the commissioner. All right! Quiet down! Salute station chief Yoon! Salute! Sit, sit. - I'll take that. - Congratulations. - Why didn't you start? - How could we? Si-yeon's not here yet? Chief Yoon Ji-hyun This is all. The witness retracted his call six minutes after that. Chief... I don't think I can make it. I got some work left. Si-yeon. 2:08 AM, December 24. Chungra cam #31. It's not that you turned a blind eye. You edited the footage. Jung Jae-chul is unpredictable. I needed insurance to get the list. List of public officials and businessmen Jung paid off. If we can get people higher up then do his sins dissolve? That's something we must accept, Si-yeon. At the academy when I took your class, do you remember what you said? What? "Do not become a monster to catch a monster." I will not become one. Fine. I have to come after you, you know that, right? Yes, I know that. No judge will issue a warrant with that video, you know that, too? Thank you for everything. - Let's eat. - Let's dig in. Suh Min-jae? Incheon Western District December 24, 2:08 AM. Not seen at chop shops nor on security cams. Victim's car must be at... Hang-dong Reservoir 100% certain. What are you doing here? What about you? I'm here to get Jung Jae-chul with you. You haven't buried the case yet? There's more evidence to destroy? I know what you think of me and internal... Here... he released the hand brake and pushed. The victim's car... But it didn't go in because of buoyancy. So with his car... Bam. He pushed it in. Just like he did to my dad. I know it's in here, but there's nothing I can do. I'm gonna get Jung Jae-chul. I'll find evidence and leak it to the media or the internet- Do you think he'll care? If not, I'll just kill him. Yeah? You should've killed him, why didn't you? Should I say it? You know your dad wouldn't want you to. Don't talk about my dad. You know shit. Hit me if you like. You came and ruined everything, you know that? I do. Very well. That's why I can't end it like this. I'll make myself clear. I have no intention to arrest him. I'm just gonna kill him! But you won't. You're not that kind of person. I... I never got to tell him. That I was at fault, that I was the instigator. He trusted me too much for 10 years. I was gonna tell him... I was going to... Suh Min-jae. Your father... was a seasoned cop who experienced it all. You think he didn't know that? Fine, let's say he didn't. What would've changed when you told him that? He's your father. Let's get Jung Jae-chul. Together. Hey man. Take that off. Doesn't suit me? I was driving by and the engine died on me. I wanted to talk to you too. Scared? That you'll be arrested? Or that you'll die? Do I look like someone who's afraid to die? I can snap your neck right now. Try me. You can't. Because you're Officer Suh. Kim Min-jae would have, though. You're right. I'm not a good man. But at least I admit what I am. I'm a piece of shit, but you... You hit someone too, as Kim Min-jae. I'm sure many lost limbs when you caused accidents. What about the druggies you sold dope to? But now you're going after bad guys? Not a shred of conscience. You're worse than I am. Can't accept it? It was bad luck that I hit someone. You're right. I'm terrible. I am a piece of shit. But I stopped, and you didn't. I am curious though, your driving chops. Let's drive together sometimes. Too bad. I would own you. Do you even know what F1 is? I do. You drive on the safest road and rank based on cars. No? Shit, you're a jalopy driver. Do you know how many cruisers were on my jalopy? I heard nothing but sirens. I was done if I was caught. I had no helmet, no safety gear, and no one to clear the path. I just hit the road. I know people like you, who think speed is everything. You got nothing on me. Go away. Let's meet again with a warrant. I'm leaving tomorrow. By the way, you're dead next time we meet. What exactly is the condition you have? Is the treatment an excuse to delay further investigation? Is it true that you're just trying to avoid charges? Is opening the F1 circuit just a show? Out of the way! 970 in the vehicle, leaving for the airport. Let's move. So many of them. I got somewhere to be. Not a chance, we have to go right. - You son of a bitch! - Hold it in. Gonna hit me? Are you allowed? Do what he says. Go to my track. I'm gonna drive my car. Shall we go pay him back? Where's the warrant? Put on the seat-belt. - Sir... - Eun Si-yeon, damn it! Sir, you don't look so well. If you screw this, I'm off to jail too. There's no time. Hurry up. Sir, is something wrong? I'll issue a warrant for Jung Jae-chul. Hit-and-run and concealment of a dead body. - On what grounds? - I got one. It's a damn sure thing. I just got here. Come right away. We have to start. Okay. Jeez, so big... Internal-5, report in. Internal-5, we've arrived. Move quickly, got it? What the...? - What the hell? - Internal-5? - What? - Jung... That son of a bitch! Cuff yourselves. - Deputy Eun? - Hurry. You came. Internal-5, answer me! - Yes, ma'am. - Get me a car to Incheon. People ahead! Police Cruiser behind the jalopy. Out of the way. Crazy bastard... It's me. Have my plane ready. I'm leaving at once. If I continue, people will get hurt. Yes, ma'am. Put me on speaker and standby. Send me your location. - Emergency situation! - Chief Woo! - Gather all cruisers! - Pardon? Our mark is an unplated black tuning car. I'll have to check with the station chief, ma'am. What? Who is the head of this control room? Answer me! You are, ma'am! Target is black tuning car, Dongsan-bound. This is a lure mission. Block routes to the airport, and lure Buster out of the city. Towards the F1 track. - Not enough cruisers. - I know. Turn on all radio channels, CB and ham as well. Tow drivers eavesdropping on police frequency, are you listening? It's me, Woo Sun-young, Western traffic chief. I'm not here to scold you, so ease up. I got a favor to ask. I need you all to block inner city roads except those to F1 track. You made mint over the years using our frequency, so this time, help us out. Anyone who can support, radio in. Hoam Apartment Complex 1, on our way. Guys, it's Yeo-Jung, Dong-su's wife. We all know who Mr. Suh was to us all. Don't we...? If you owe him even once, if you ever got a meal from him... Don't think of anything and just help. Please... Just help... We'll begin searching now! Dosan-dong Park, I'll go to Complex 2. I'll block the exit to Yongjong bridge. I'm near Chungra, where do you want me? DG Towing, I'll get the junction. I'll be there as well. It'll be dangerous, so just block the roads, and nothing else. Got it? Send me a cruiser in the area. Let's split up. I'll lure him elsewhere. Lieutenant. Be careful. You, too. Ma'am, the station chief is on the way, from HQ too. Where is she? It's been a while, Yoon Ji-hyun. Sun-young, open this right away! Chief Woo, I'm taking over this op. You haven't changed at all, still playing dirty. I'm going in. It's strengthened glass with dual locks. This is Incheon, my turf. - Gonna continue bitching? - Yeah, I won't let it slide this time. I'm done if I'm fired, but you'll rot behind bars! Will you take the fall if Officer Suh kills Jung Jae-chul? Good luck. Woo Sun-young! Open this door! SWAT ETA to Incheon? 25 minutes, ma'am. Send in a chopper first with a sniper. Min-jae, finish this ASAP. Left turn in 30m! What the hell? Buster is on Guil Street. Bosung tow truck, Park, standby. Block the alley. Curve ahead. Cruiser 162, DG tow truck. Now. Cruiser 249! Two minutes to Buster. Take a right before the junction. Be advised, Buster is fleeing to outskirts of West Incheon. Dong-su, are you ready? Come at me, bitch! Stupid morons... Requesting back up at F1 track south tunnel! I have to get one shot. Just one shot. Shit! Out of the way! Son of a bitch. Situation under control, return to HQ. I'll take the heat, let's move. Where's Suh Min-jae and Eun Si-yeon? Arrest them at first sight! Don't do it. I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt you. Safety of the witness is priority. Acquire sniping position. Moving to position, haven't received briefing. Briefing needed- It's a state of emergency, mission comes first. You got any evidence to lock me up? Found a body? Or got a warrant? Jung Jae-chul. I got the warrant. Prosecutor Ki. I'm sorry. They screwed us. JC Motors' CTO Choi confessed to hit-and-run, admitting he fled the scene and concealed the accident. No time to retrieve the victim's car and disprove his alibi. Did you blank out? Not sure what to do? It'd have been easy if you were Kim Min-jae. Well done. In position. Awaiting order. I told you, you'd die, s-son of a bitch. Fire. Target missed! Increasing altitude due to bad weather. I'm fine. It went through. What about the warrant? Suh Min-jae, you can't. Don't do it! Suh Min-jae! Suh Min-jae! Where is it? Officer. You lost. G-g-gonna kill me? But you're a cop. You know... Kim Min-jae isn't. Min-jae. Don't. Jung Jae-chul, you're under arrest... for attempted murder of an officer, and hit-and-run. Stupid bastard. That was self-defense. What you see... is the truth, right? Wake up, Min-jae! Min-jae! Call 119! Now! Jung Jae-chul found guilty. Body found in the trunk. Silver Spooner: Watching the news? Don't even mention it. He drove so fast! I get cold sweat just thinking about it. A cultivator may be loud, but it's slow like a turtle, so how can it...? If I can't catch it, then it's hit-and-run! You don't believe me? I'll show you! No, it's okay. - Look at my side. - No, no... - No, it's fine. - That could've been bad. - Did you go to the ER? - Of course not! Playing cards isn't important! You have to go to the ER! Cops need to see it. You should've been awarded and promoted... I couldn't even stop your relocation. I'm sorry. I told you before that none of that matters to me. Change the subject. I heard Chief Woo got promoted. She became the station chief. Station chief, eh? I heard you have a special team. What's the case? Commissioner Park was in an accident. What accident? Hit-and-run, no evidence at the scene. There's something I need you to do for me. Only you can do this. When should I start? HIT-AND-RUN SQUAD Have a seat. Know Kim Min-jae? I heard that you were faster than him. Says who? Nice tattoo. What do you want? We'll get to that later. Anyways... how did you know Kim Min-jae?
