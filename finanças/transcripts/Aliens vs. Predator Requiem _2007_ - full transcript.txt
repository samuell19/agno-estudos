Darcy: What the hell? Dallas: This is our help?! What the fuck is going on, Eddie?! Where the hell are the bodies? Oh, they're gonna kill us all! We're not dead yet. There may be weapons and equipment we can still use. Radio. (Beeping) National guard, come in. (Over radio): Repeat-any national guard unit, come in. This is colonel Stevens, U.S. army. Identify yourself. Sheriff Eddie Morales. Gunnison, Colorado. You have to help us, colonel. There's some kind of infestation and if we don't get help soon, there won't be any of us left. What's the army's evacuation pl an? Colonel? Colonel, we need immediate evac. (Over radio): Sheriff, all ground routes have been compromised. There is an airlift in 30 minutes from Gilliam circle. Confirm: Airlift, Gilliam circle. We'll be there in 20 minutes. But that's right in the center of town. We'll be there, colonel. What the fuck are you? Kelly: Everyone, get in the striker! I'll drive. Get up, go, go, go, go. You sure you can drive that thing? All right, I'll get on the gun. Don't miss. Don't crash. (Engine rumbles) Hold on!

It doesn't make any sense. Gilliam circle is right in the center of town. We'll be surrounded by those things. - Wait a second-what are you saying? - I think the colonel was lying. That's crazy. The government doesn't lie to people. The army thinks about containment first. They can't risk this getting any worse. Help is a few miles down that road and they're waiting for us. Now, if you won't drive us there, I will. Eddie, if she's right, the only thing down that road are more of those things. You're not seriously considering this. I'm considering whatever keeps us alive. Which means getting out of this town. There are only two helicopters in town, but one's at the airport. No, it's too far. We'll never make it. The other one's at the hospital. The people at the hospital probably used it to get out. That's a ch ance we have to take. If you're wrong and the helicopter's gone, we're all dead. If I'm right, they're dead if they follow you. Kelly: There's a truck coming. Announcer (Over P.A.): There will be an emergency evacuation from Gilliam circle. Medical care and airlift... Sheriff, what the hell are you doing in there? Never mind that. You guys heading to the airlift? Yeah. Okay, follow us. We don't have much time. All right, listen up. Everybody's got to choose right now. (Emergency siren wailing in distance) I'm going to the hospital with the tank. We all need to go to the center of town. - That's right. - I'm going with my brother. - I'm with you. - I'm going in the tank. Dallas, don't do this. She's wrong. And brother or not, he's wrong. You're gonn a get them killed! We're running out of time, sheriff-we gotta move now. Hold on! We're coming with you! Wait. Take care. I hope we're both wrong. Announcer: Medical care and airlift... Let's go! Announcer: There will be an emergency evacuation from Gilliam circle. Medic Al care and airlift will be provided for all residents. I didn't help anybody. I was too Scared. I just watched them die. All right, put these on. You, too. (Engine whirs to a stop) (Latch clanks) (Thunder rumbles) All right, listen, whatever happens inside, the only person that can't get hurt is Kelly, all right? We all protect Kelly. What is this, the Titanic? Screw the women and children first shit, man. Look, asshole, unless you can fly the helicopter, shut the fuck up. Let's go.
