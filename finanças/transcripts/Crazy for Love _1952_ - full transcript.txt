- "You are requested to attend.. ..to the convoy of Célestin Lemoine, innkeeper, who died at the age of 68. He should have drunk less calva, he wouldn't have left so quickly. She continues to read. -Augustine Lemoine, his sister-in-law. - And something else too. -The Granville and Lenormand families. At the church. -On ira. -Yes. - Good morning, Mr. Mayor. - Good morning, Mr. Doctor. -Who is coming to see us today? - The doctor treats the living, and the mayor buries the dead. - Well, he's not idle, that one. -No. - Hi, Mr. Doctor. - Firmin. How's it going with you? - Yes, except the boss. She is in bed. -You do not say anything ? If it had been for your horse... I will pass. - There's no rush. Bells. -M. the mayor. - Good morning, Mr. Mayor. -Hello, Testu. How is your little girl? -Better, the fever is gone. - She will be healed soon. Can I see her ? -Yes. Have a coffee before going up. -I'm not saying no. That's the faculty. Hello, Pitcher. - Good morning, Mr. Mayor. - Your daughter was due to arrive. -This very evening. - This Madeleine. I gave birth to her... And here she is, teacher. - Teacher, only. She must replace Miss Surret. -Yes I know. - A calvados with the coffee. -No thanks. - I haven't seen you since Célestin Lemoine's transport. He suffered ? - He was unconscious. An attack. - In your opinion, who will inherit the inn? -No, "inherit the inn". - The teacher is right. Don't say "inherit the hostel" but "inherit the hostel". -Is that so. So, who will inherit... Finally, who will get the inn? "Le Trou Normand" is good. -Yes, with land and surely a full chest. -Célestin being single, the inheritance returns.. ..to his brother's widow, Augustine. -Sure, especially since she did everything for that. We saw her more often at the inn than in her charcuterie. -Hello. -What do you want ? -My feet. And the boss? - There is the funeral. -Oh yes. -I'm coming. Miss Augustine. -What ? - Mrs. Vacher wants his feet. -In the cooler, with his name. -Good thank you. -What a gourd, she can't do anything! Javotte ! Are you coming? -Yes, is there a fire? -Answer differently. Help me put on my veil. I took yours out. -Why ? - Are you a savage? You are his niece. -But Mom... -You will buy pretty things with the inheritance. -Thank you. -Poor Celestin. Will I keep Hippolyte? -These shoes are a bit tight. Ouch ouch! Something falls. -Il and in a of the naphtaline. I will smell good. Things are going well. -So ? Uncle's suit. -A little tight in the shoulders and buttocks. And these shoes compress my fingers. -One must suffer to be beautiful. And your tie? -Ah yes, help me put it on. Say, Maria, will she say anything, Aunt Augustine? - You could go to the funeral of the uncle, with your apron? And I don't care about the boss of the left hand. - What did she have in her left hand? -Big fool. Didn't you understand what she was doing with the uncle? -The uncle and... Oh ! As a family, it's not good. -Since the time her husband has been eating dandelions by the root. And there was the inn. Not stupid. -The inn? -For Javotte's dowry. Your gloves. -How are you. I love my cousin, I would marry her for nothing, if she said yes... - You don't think you're a gentleman, because you took off your clogs. -A man... -The uncle liked you, but he left you in the henhouse. La Javotte won't want a servant, so don't dream. Put on the hat. -The uncle was thin, but he had a big head. Klaxon. -It's the customers. I'm coming ! I'm coming ! -What are they doing in there? -I'm coming. - We sleep at your place! - But... - Put 20 liters. - Hey, honey. -What ? -Look at his face. -He is funny. -It must be for a local party. -So say. Your costume is successful, where did you find it? - At my uncle's, it was in a box with mothballs. -What do you represent? -The nephew. -In what ? - From the funeral. - From whom? - By Celestin Lemoine. -It's funny ? -Non. You want to laugh, it's sad. Very sad. That's 1,204 francs. - Hold on, keep everything. -Thank you. - What time is the performance? -Ah, it's at 11 o'clock. - We will come to applaud you. -Hein ? -Have fun. -You have good ones. How stupid they are. Bye. Hey, Maria. I have money. -Put it in your pocket. -Oh yes. Go on. -Let's go. Bells. -Condolences. -Condolences. -My condolences. -Hippolyte. -Eh ? - Run to the inn for the notary, I have to go to the shop. Make some coffee and put the costume away. -Already ? - Obey! - Yes, aunt. - Don't talk harshly to him. The uncle, he knew how to take it. What will become of it? -To stay, he will have to go straight. -And for me, feeding and yelling at you is hardly paying. -Maria, you will know my instructions. Come, Javotte! - Right away, mom. Bye. - You can't go to the ball. - Next Sunday, no. After for Popaul, I will manage. -How? 'Or' What ? -I'll say that I'm going to babysit your sister's kids who are going to dance. - She doesn't dance, my sister. - Idiot, it looks like Hippolyte. Bye. - Poor uncle. Well, that's life. -Mom is coming with the notary, have you prepared everything? -Yes. -Good. -Javotte. Javotte ! It's beautiful, huh? The uncle liked his quilt. We had bought it in Rouen. Feel it below. It's soft, warm like a chick under its mother. What do you do ? Don't touch business. The Sunday shirt. -He is dead. -I can't do it. I hear him say to me: "Hippolyte, what a moron!" "Hippolyte, curmudgeon!" - Did you like it? - He said it nicely. - I have to decide mom to throw everything away. -To throw away what? -Here, we need toilets, there, knock down the partition. -The house will fall. -Pushes you. Here, a bathroom. -Why ? -For customers to wash. - They come here to sleep. - You are incorrigible. The "Trou Normand" will change, and then it's none of your business. -Javotte, Javotte. -What ? - Say, say. Say. -What ? -Here, it may be our room, one day. -Our bedroom ? -Yes. Uncle's bed with the beautiful quilt... This will be our bed when we get married. - Marry you, a jerk like you? You didn't look at me! - My coffee, my coffee! - Mr. Notary, we are listening to you. -We're going.. ..read the will. -Maria, serve and get out of the room. -She's a bit of the family, she can stay. -Is that so. -Give me the files. Where is Hippolyte? -What do you need? -Her presence. -Truly ? - Yes, it's the nephew. -Hippolyte! -Hippolyte! -Go and get it ! -Candy ! Hippolyte ! Hippolyte ! You are deaf ? -What ? -Come. -Why ? - The whole family must be there. -Is that so ? -You may have... ..a little something. -Hello, Hippolyte. - Good morning, Mr. Notary. - No, read. "This is my will. I, the undersigned Célestin Lemoine, .. bequeaths .. ..The Norman hole.. ..located in Courteville, ..and comprising the building, ..3 hectares of land, the gas station and all the furniture, ..laundry, cellar, ..and its content, ..to my nephew.. ..Hippolyte Lemoine. - You misread! - No, I can read, Hippolyte Lemoine. -He couldn't have done that to me and left the hostel to that one! - Shut up, wicked woman, I'm happy! -I have the inn? -Ladies! Listen to me. -Good. -Ah finally. Sit down. There is a condition to the inheritance. Carry on. - "To my nephew... - We know! -Son of my brother and Séraphine... But since Hippolyte is... ..an ignoramus, and that to run a business, .. it takes knowledge, ..I set a formal condition. For Hippolyte to touch his heritage, ..he will have to get.. ..his certificate.. ..of studies. -Ha ha ha! -Ha ha ha! -Ha ha ha! -Hippolyte on the benches of the school, it's to die of laughter. - So he won't have the inn, look at him, it's a foregone conclusion. -Hippolyte, did you hear? So ? - Tell them you accept. -I'm not going to school, I'm too old. And I have too much work. -You see ? You are wise. Have him sign the waiver. - Take it easy, madam. Here is a 2nd envelope, ..which must be opened after the examination. To give up, it's in 15 days. -I know what's inside. But let's wait 15 days. - Put away. Hippolyte, you will come to see me at my study. And think carefully. Bye. -Bye. -Mrs. -Bye. - No, come. - Sit down, let's talk. Come, Javotte. You will go to the notary on Wednesday. I'll pay for the bus and you'll sign where necessary. -Why did the notary tell me: "Think carefully"? -To confuse you. Hey, Javotte? - Yes, beware of these people. -To be careful ? -But I'm here. -So, how are you. -Do you see yourself with brats? - In front of a blackboard? -I would have had the dunce cap. -Surely. -Surely. -I take you into my service. -At the charcuterie? -No, you stay here, because in 15 days, the hostel is ours. -You and is? -The aunt will be the boss and will sleep under the beautiful quilt? - Finally you understood. What are you looking for, mom? -His savings. -The boss ? The boss, we'll see. -You made a mess of it, you refused to be the master. - I accept and I go to the notary. -Bravo ! Here are some money. -That's it. -Don't let it go. -Oh but... You'll see. Can I go up? -Where are you going ? -At Breteuil. -Mounted. -She won't have the comforter. Children's disputes. -Would you like? -Hello. I'm looking for Mr. Pichet for school. - He's taken, I'm his daughter. For a student? -Yes. -Little or big ? -I dunno. -How so ? - Big, though... -I see, your son is sick... Cris. -Stop! - No, he will come, finally, it is I who will come. - "Will come". Looking for homework? -No it's not that. I will come and do them. -You ? It is direct. Follow me. Papa. A student's father wants to see you. -Hippolyte, hello, Hippolyte! -Hello, Mr. Pichet. -You do not know him. Hippolyte, Lemoine's nephew. Do you have a commission? - Yes, I have a letter for you. - From whom then? - From the notary of Breteuil. -Give it to me. "Mr. teacher, please receive Hippolyte Lemoine, ..who to become.. ..his uncle's heir, ..must go back to school, ..to obtain his certificate of studies in the current year. Your uncle had original ideas. -You will laugh at me. - No, it's brave. Hey, Madeleine? -Yes. -Isn't it too late? - No, I will help you. -Oh yes ? I thought you would refuse, I'm lucky. - "I" have luck. 1st person indicative, I have. -It begins. See you tomorrow at 9 a.m., we'll give you a notebook. I will introduce you to the children. Bye. -Thank you. Goodbye Miss Pichet. I have you have... I have, he has... Dis, Maria, Maria! Maria ! I start tomorrow morning, the municipal school. Don't tell Aunt Augustine anything. -I have no intention. -No, "I" don't intend. 1st person indicative of avoir. The instruction begins. -Hippolyte goes back to school so that Augustine doesn't have the inheritance. It is well done. - Him at school? -It's a secret. Even he has already seen the 1st person of the indicative. Hippolyte goes to school so that Augustine doesn't inherit. -Not possible ? -Yes ! Hippolyte goes to school so that Augustine doesn't inherit. -How? 'Or' What ? -Yes ! -Children, children! Hurry to break the crust. I go to school and I don't want to be late. Otherwise I will miss my certificate. Well, that's how it goes. Now grass for my rabbits. And here we go. Let's go. Go on ! Let's see! Come on, I'm going to school. -Hippolyte. -Eh ? - Guess what I'm bringing you. - Oh, a school bag! -And then a pencil box. -Oh ! Oh oh oh ! He is handsome. -It was my little guy. -Look, a green pen holder. A red pen holder... One, two, three pencils. And that ? -Eraser. -I will make mistakes. -Why ? - Without it, what would it be for me? -Oh yes. -We put it all away so that... I put it. -It suits you. -Oh yes. -Hurry up. -Wait for me ! -Hippolyte, here's your 4 o'clock. - Thank you, Maria. -Be wise and work well. -Yes. See you tonight, Maria. - Am I looking for the plow? - It's not worth it, it's not heavy. -Walking fast ..you will be the 1st at Polytechnique. -It's possible. Polytechnique, where is this village? -2 and 2, how much is that? - That's 4. And a girl like you is 0. -Bravo, Hippolyte, it's great to learn at any age. Go ahead, good luck. -Thank you, Mr. Testu. -Isn't that unfortunate? Monsieur makes his shots below. You are grotesque, you are the laughingstock of all! - Oh, my schoolbag! -Look at this moron, this jeans-cum! - Leave it! -What I concern myself ? -Other people's business. -We'll see that ! -Leave him alone! -You brute! - The sausage girl, buckle up! Come on, Hippolyte, go to school, go to your inn. It is the will of Celestin, yes, of the uncle! Don't be afraid, I will defend you. Hey ! - You don't scare me! -Laughs best who laughs last ! You jerk off! -Stopped ! -Hurry up, Hippolyte, and arrive on time next time. -Hippolyte ! - Hello, comrades. -Silence. You know Hippolyte, he's coming to study from today. Everyone be nice to him. Forward! Brouhaha. -Come on, Hippolyte. -Silence please ! -Where do I sit? -Basically. Clamors. -I said quiet! -He can't come in. -Calm down ! I should have thought of that. Tomorrow, you will have a bench in your size. Now to work. We start with reading. This is a book to follow. Page 89... "Mr. Seguin's goat". You start... Nicolas ? -Mr. Seguin's goat. The wind freshened, the mountain turned purple. It was the evening. "Already," said the goat. -Continue, Albert. -Then there was a scream... -A scream, the "h" is aspirated. - A howl in the mountains. -Good. -"Ouh ouh!", the goat thought of the wolf and wanted to come back. But she saw two short ears, 2 eyes, it was the wolf. -Julien ? - The centimeter is the 100th... - Yes. It's the arithmetic book, but I talked about the reading book. Hippolyte ? So, Hippolyte? -We come. Laughs. -Come on, gentlemen! Continue reading. -Me ? - Yes and very strong. "It was the wolf... -Il se mit ... -Go on. -Hush! So is it for tomorrow? Yes. -He laughed wickedly, looking at the little white goat. Should I imitate his laugh? Laughs. -Silence, you people! No, but in this sentence the goat is a direct complement. -A direct compliment? -Lets go ! Continue. -Uh... Since he knew he would eat her, the wolf was in no hurry. And he was licking his toddlers. - No, not toddlers. "Bambine" is the feminine of toddler. -Oh yes. -Little girl. There, it is chops. - Yes, it is there. -That is to say, the hanging lips of certain animals. And why was the wolf licking its chops? -Ah, well, it's to show the goat that he liked it. Compliment indirect. Laughs. -Quiet! The next one will copy the verb "to laugh" 100 times. Close your reading books, I'm going to question you.. ..on the stars and planets. Come on, Pierrot? How many kinds of stars? -There are stars... Planets, satellites. - Yes, satellites. -Satellites. -Good. -And then... - Hush, don't blow. -There are also those who have hair and a long tail. -She must look good, that star. Laughs. - Calm down, children. Hippolyte is surprised, because this is new to him. Uh... The planet, whose name Pierrot has forgotten, ..but which he described well, is called a comet. -Is that so ? -Yes. A comet. And what is the difference... ..between a star and a comet? -The stars have points. -Points ? Yes, if you want, you represent them that way. And why do they have spikes? -I do not know. -Monsieur. -Ah, Hippolyte has found it! So, Hippolyte? Why do they have spikes? -It's because... This is for hanging them in Christmas trees. Laughs. - Come on, it's not funny! You think we waited for the cardboard stars, ..to make those of the sky? Laughs. -Another question. What is the most useful star? The sun.. ..or the moon? - Sir, it's not difficult. It's the moon. - Ha ha, and why? -Because without the moon, at night, we wouldn't see anything. While during the day it is light. Laughs. -Lets go ! Quiet, children! They laugh too. - Instead of laughing stupidly, ..you should come.. ..educate you! - Here is your 20 liters. -Where is the comic who was there? - What comedy? -The amateur artist. -Which ? -The one who had made a stupid face. - A stupid face. Ah, Hippolyte, he comes in the evening, at 5 am after school. -After school ? He's still going? How old is he ? -30 years. He has to hurry to get his certificate. - It's a crazy family. -Yes so ! -See you tomorrow, you haven't worked too badly. -It is now that I am going to work, in the vegetable garden. But I'm happy, I had a good laugh. Goodbye, teacher. -Learn your lessons. -If I have time. -How so ? What are you doing in class? -The garden, the customers... Rabbits and all that... -Do you want to have it, your inn? -Yes... -Father Antoine will do the garden. - And who will pay? -We will ask the notary. Go back to work. - The notary is not the one who will do the garden. -See you tomorrow. Are you happy with yourself? -Not very well. I learn, but I forget quickly. If I have a commission, I tie my handkerchief, to remind me. But there, with all that I have to remember, it would take linen. I can't do it alone. -I can come from time to time, in the evening to help you. -Would you do that? -Since I offer it to you. -Okay. - I'll put things in order. -Thank you. Good bye, young lady... -Bye. Bells. -For the ball, I said I'd babysit your sister's kids. - Meet after lunch. -I'll go by Solex, we'll be free. Take a dress. - Javotte! -Mum ? -Well then ? What are you plotting? - She told me to bring a book. - Javotte will return before nightfall. -Yes Madam. Bye. -What a jerk! -Ha ha ha! -Why are you laughing? - I think about my answer to Mr Pichet. He tells me... A tank is perforated, and a liter of water flows per minute. So given the, the... Anyway, he talks about a lot of things. He said to me like this: "What operation are you doing?" I answer him: "If the tank has a hole, I do a weld." Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! He really broke me. -Why, what would he have done? Motor. - It's Javotte. Javotte ! Javotte, stop, Javotte! Where are they going? This is the road to Bernay. - At La Ferrière, there is a ball. - But Javotte is in mourning. "La Louisette has her promised, and Javotte perhaps too." It's his age. -I do not want. - Go ahead, run behind! - Yes, and I will pedal. And she doesn't scare me. She will know that I am her promised. And then if she ever answers me, I'll give her a slap like that. -Hippolyte, no, Hippolyte! Orchestra. -There is nothing. -For the theatre? -Art benefits from my discoveries, I am an impresario. Intimacy reveals a future actress. -You think ? -At the 1st kiss, I know if the girl will be submissive, ..or if she will be able to tell me "I love you" with a hoarse voice. Like Danielle. -With her you hit the bullseye. - Nice formula. Come, let's go. -I leave you. -Here's Mimi. -Where is Popaul? - He is fishing. -I'm out of luck. -I'm looking for it. -Let's dance first. Doesn't it bother you, Javotte? - No, go dancing. -You are beautiful. -I was afraid. - Blush, you must be fine. -A picture of the ball? - No, no picture. -We'll see after. Let's go dancing. -Popaul will stay fishing. - You are not moved? Your heart is beating. -Excuse me, but we must not know that I am at the ball. -A jealous lover? -No. -Many ? -No. -Tour as you are... -I'll give him one of those slaps! She will see ! - Javotte, it's charming. I am Jean-Marco. Theatrical impresario. When I love a girl ..she becomes a star. You have a theater physique. - A theater physique? -You would be successful, and I'm always right. - Actress, do you think so? -Why not ? You learn a part of the role, and you call me to Rouen. I'm in the directory. - I would never dare. -Why don't you want to see me again? -Javotte! Javotte ! -Oh, Hippolyte ! Javotte ! -You know him ? - You are in mourning. And you dance? -Leave me. -The uncle will come back at night, haunt you. -Let Miss dance. -It's my cousin, Javotte. So I can talk to him. -Stay polite. And leave us. -You're going to get out of here! -I'll go with you! -Go see outside if I'm there! -I will stay here if I want! -I will make you.. ..shame. Do you see this fool? He's so dumb he has to go back to school. Like a 5 year old kid! Laughs. -I do difficult things, the perimeter, the tape measure... Things you don't understand. -Oh ! - And neither do you! Rumors of protest. -If her mother finds out that she is there, it will make her ugly. -Out, Hippolyte, out, Hippolyte! - He must be in the pantry. Come in, Louisette. -What will you say? He won't listen to you. - Mom must know nothing. Take the bike home. -There is the pass as you said. - Yes, I'll show you. To trace the relief, take your pencil. You lay mine flat, and you do this. Do you see the mountains? -It's pretty. -And you steer clear, there are no more Pyrenees. - You ruined everything. - Are you just coming back now? -Shh, I'll talk to you later. -I am leaving. -Melle Pichet, the teacher's daughter. -We know each other. - At school, she was an old woman. -3 more years. -Just 3 years old? But you are ageless. - I leave you, I will not give lessons in politeness. - Good evening, bun! -What does it mean ? - That was his nickname. -She is angry. - We are calm. I need to talk to you. -No. -Sit down ! - No, I'm not talking to you anymore. - Do you regret your behavior? -Me ? -Listen I forgive you, on one condition... Don't tell anyone about the ball, anyone, you hear? If you talk, I'll show something. -What ? -A picture of you at the ball. -Give me that ! -I do not have it. It's the photographer, but I can show it. - You won't do that, Javotte. "So promise me you won't shut up. -Yes. -Good. -The chain of the Pyrenees extends between France and Spain. From the Atlantic to... It's annoying, the Pyrenees, why bother? Madeleine sniffles. -Dad. -What ? Madeleine ! Madeleine sobs. -Madeleine. But what do you have? - It's nothing, dad. - Calm down, my dear. Na, na, na. Teddy ! All in good time. What hurt you? -Papa. -Yes ? What is it ? -I am ugly ? - Ugly, you? But you are charming. Who told you that ? Hippolytus? -No. javotte. She came to the inn. - What a little bitch! We will take revenge with elegance. Hippolyte must obtain his school certificate. And you will see Madame Lemoine. -It's a conspiracy. -Yes. Good night. Go to bed and tell yourself that Javotte can't come close to your ankle. -The Capetians are Henry 1... Robert the Pious... No, the Capetians are... -Hello. -Hello. He deceives me. The Capétiens are Hugues Capet, Robert the Pious, Henri 1er... Louis 6 the Fat, Louis 7 the Younger. Oh oh oh ! They are funny with their names. As long as I don't get confused. The Capetians are Hugues Capet... Hissing. -Ah ! Hippolyte ! -What ? -Between. -I go to school. - Come in, it's serious. Have you seen the newspaper? Between. -Hello. -Hello, Hippolyte. -Go to the bottom. -Most... What is it ? - Take a look. Who is it ? - Oh, it's me. -Listen to the commentary. He reads. The last of the illiterates of France doubled with a minus habens. -Hein ? C'est one, un- less? Un-less, idiot! He's a moron who allows himself to be photographed. - Test! -What ? - Give us that. -A second. Who is the bastard who made this joke? -I dunno. - But where were you? Where were you doing the puppet? -Uh... At La Ferriere. -At La Ferriere. So listen dude... Someone wants you. -Eh ? -Show this newspaper to M. Pichet, he will advise. -Good ! -If it hadn't been for this newspaper, you wouldn't have told me. We kill ourselves raising children. -I don't want to sell pudding. I will do theatre. - You are crazy, Hippolyte is right. What if I had been there? - You would have been proud. Your daughter has a theater physique. -Ha! -Yes. People will talk about me on the radio. -On the radio ? - And with that, Madam? -That's all. -Hippolyte. -And school ? -Javotte, look at that, it must tell you something. -It's not me. -Leave her. -Who is it ? -I dunno. -Go away ! - You know, it's the guy from the ball? -He's a gentleman, you're an ass-earth. Get out immediately! -No ! - Do you know the slaps? -Yes. -What a moron ! -Oh ! -Do you want one too? -Oh ! -Who loves well chatises as well. "Who", neutral indefinite pronoun, "punishes", 3rd person present. -The last Carolingians... Despite the resistance they imposed on the dukes of France, ..were supplanted by them. What year, Julian? -In 996. -Very good. At that time, ..Hugues Capet founded the 3rd dynasty of our kings, ..that of the Capetians. Ah ! Monsieur Hippolyte deigns to join us. What is it ? -I explain to you. - Go sit down, we'll see later. So I was telling you that Hugues Capet founded.. ..the 3rd dynasty of our kings, ..that of the Capetians. Hippolyte. You must.. ..learn your lesson. Come and recite the Capetian kings to us. -The Capetians? Those, then! - Are you going to know? -Yes. Laughs. -Chut, silence! I'm listening to you. - After the last Carolingians, came the Capetians... The Capetians are Hugues Capet... Who founded the dynasty. Robert the Pious, Robert the Pious... They blow. - Don't blow! - Henry 1st. Philip... No. Louis, Louis the Fat. Oh no, the Fat one comes after. I start all over again. Uh... The Capétiens are Hugues Capet... Robert the Pious, Henry 4... -Henry 4? -No, Henri 1, I am wrong in the numbers. Henry 1, Philip the Fat... I always stumble on the Gros. How is it... Louis 7 the Younger... Philip the Bold... Louis the Hutin... Philip Augustus... Augustine la Grosse. Test the Bald... Hippolytus the Handsome... -What are you saying ? - Sir, they took my... -Joseph, come see. Come, quickly! Go to the corner. Laughs. - Are you laughing at that? Have you ever seen a photo? You'll come see me. Go to your place. -Is that so. - So I was telling you... At the advent of Hugues Capet... Royalty was weak. -Dad. -What ? -The rural guard is there, we want you. - I doubt why. -Why ? -Why ? Take. Look on the 4th page. Hippolyte, come with me. -Well sir. - Put them on recess. -Yes. -It's serious. -And how ! As soon as I saw this rag, I ran. Someone knocked. -Come in ! -Pitcher. -Doctor. - You brought the wag. - Yes, Hippolyte told me everything. - You got us into a pretty mess. -I was at the ball and I didn't even dance. - You should have stayed quiet! -Who would have done this to you? Speak ! -I dunno. -It's a coup of the reactionaries. -Surely. -To unbolt us. I imagine the next article: "A retrograde municipality, ..backlogs abound... In the elections, we will lose 200 votes. - Our village is humiliated, and even all of Normandy. -If it's so much fuss and I'm just a fool, ..I can let it all go. -No, on the contrary, don't stop at the certificate, go to the license. Your doctorate, your aggregation. -Let's not exaggerate. - But we must stop the scandal, because the journalists will come here. -If journalists come to the hostel, you don't say anything, huh? - I call the prefect to get a correction. I saved his daughter last year. Hello ? Janine ? Give me the prefecture. - See you soon, hello at home. -Okay, Mr. Lemoine. -Come in. - Is it the famous Trou Normand? -The famous ? Why ? -For nothing. Boss, I want cider. -I'm not the boss yet. Why these questions, you are a journalist? - No, representative in pencils. -So, how are you. 'Cause some might turn up, so you think... Broken. -It brings luck. But I have a list of answers that the teacher wrote me. You must beware. -Yes. And why will they come, these journalists? -Are you coming to question me or for the cider? -For the cider. -Wedding. -Duval, always the 1st. -You know each other ? -He is also a representative in pencils. -Like him. -We do the region together. -So... -And here is Giroud, the 3rd representative of pencils. - Oh, say so. -He was missing. -We use pencils here. A cider? -Yes. - Ah yes! These reporters don't seem to be coming. But let them come, because with me... My lips are sealed. They will know nothing. -Since we are between us... We'll have a nice chat. -It's not a refusal. You are kind, and I have time. -You don't need pencils? -Pencils ? -You go to school. -Yes. -And why this ? -I'll tell you everything, between us... Imagine... - The bastard, he won't take it to heaven! Mum ! - What do they all have? -Look, Hippolyte has spoken. He drags us through the mud. In this one too. -Oh ! -Look here, look. - You told everything! - You ate tiger. -No, I had coffee with toast. -Don't be silly. -You let yourself be fooled. -Despite my warning. - I didn't see the journalists. I saw pencil sellers who even bought me a drink. - They made fun of you. -It's strange. The prefect had to rectify. I remind him. -He'll see what wood I'm warming up! -He has ! Get out of there! Augustine shouts. - Mrs. Lemoine! Madame Lemoine, no, school is not a public place! -Let's see! - Mr. Prefect. -Yes ? -Dr. Aubert de Courteville. - Pass it to me. Hello doctor. Yes I am sorry. We were overtaken by the journalists. -It's a scandal. I'm not exaggerating, but the story takes on grotesque proportions. And if France Dimanche gets involved, we won't get out of it. And it falls on a brave boy. It's brave to go back to school. - It's too late to rectify. Wait. The only way is to go straight for it, ..and publicity that makes your student a star. Yes, I am calling the press and here is what I propose to you. -Laporte Jean. -Here. - Your average is low and for your behavior, see with your father. Stone pike. -Here. -One more point in history. -Lenormand Albert. -Here. - Progress, keep going. Lemoine Hippolyte. -Here. I have good news for you. -Is that so ? - You have the cross. -No ? -Yes, the simple cross, while waiting for the cross of honour. Put it on your blouse. -Oh, Mr. Pitcher. You have cooled down. - No, but I'm not giving it to you. You will give it to me. -Is that so ? - Unless you still deserve it. Here is your booklet. -Is that so. -Dad. -What is it ? -Reporters want to photograph Hippolyte. -Is it known already? - They say you know. - They are good, look for them. Go to your place. -Is that so. - My children, we come to photograph Hippolyte. It is an honor for the school, beneficial to all. So be wise. Upright ! Gentlemen, come in, you come to photograph our phenomenon. You're lucky, he got the cross. Assisi! - You will not see my cross. Go for it. What will you do with all this? Yes what ? Go for it. To be. The table is small, it overflows. It won't be for the picture. But it's up to me. - We'll give it to you. -Is that so. From where ? Over there. Go ahead, don't be shy. - Hold hands. -Is that so. Go for it. -Thank you. -Is that so. -Goodbye, gentlemen. - Do we do that when a student has the cross? - Is it Courteville? -Yes. -Where is the Trou Normand? -This way, at the exit of the village. -On the right. -Thank you. -Javotte! Where is the little one? Javotte ! -Worthy son of the hero who gave birth to you. -Full of customers at the hostel. - Deliver the universe of a monster... - You don't care, with your fables. - No, "Phèdre". - Don't you have better things to do? - The widow loves Hippolyte. -You should have loved Hippolyte. - But I don't like him. When my mouth implored the name of the goddess, I adored Hippolyte. -You do too much. - And the seer... -You irritate me with your Hippolyte, and remove this curtain that you dirty. The whole village is at his feet. They adore him, and we are ignored. Say something ! -What ? -He will succeed ? -The certificate of studies, it's easy, and then it will be boosted. - Me, I am not resigned, I will have this inn. I did everything to get it. There is a way, I will find it. Phone. -Phone ? -I go. -No. -Hello ? I didn't ask for Rouen. -It's me. -Ah, your artistic career, your impresario. Wait until you're of age. I don't want a cabotine, there's already an idiot. Cancel. -There is someone ? -Yes I'm coming. -Janine, don't cancel Rouen, give me the call quickly. Phone. -Who is speaking ? Oh yes, perfectly. If I remember correctly. Courteville's daughter? javotte. We do not forget this first name. I can do your portrait. Golden hair... Hazel eyes... Round cheeks... A sensual mouth... A slim and supple waist... And then some... I remember. -I want to audition. -Do you want... My house ? 22 Capuchin Street. On the ground floor, yes. Don't forget, 22. That's it. Let's say... The day after tomorrow. Three hours. Understood. -Hello. -Hello. -Who were you meeting? -To my coal merchant. -He has chest, ..your merchant. -So little... Hustle and bustle of school children. -Stand up. Don't forget that I'm the boss. Go on. Follow. Faster. Lets go. Go on. One. Two. -One. Two. One. Two. -When we ask children, fanfan... If they came through the chimney, nah... They answer you "it's obvious", denden, ..sucking licorice and catechu, darling. -Fanfan, nene. Denden, chouchou. -Fanfan is born in cabbage cabbage. - Haha! -It's mom. -Ha ha. -It's dad. - Ha ha ha. -Who taught us all this. -Ha ha. -It's mom. -Ha ha. -It's dad. -Ha ha. -Who taught us all this. The children wake up very early, toto. Mom combs their hair, widow. But in the evening, they come back muddy, suckled. Dirty nose and mud up to your knees, nanny. -Toto widow suckled nanny. -Toto wants to suckle a nanny. -Ha ha. -It's mom. -Ha ha. -It's dad. -Ha ha. -Who taught us all this. -Ha ha. -It's mom. -Ha ha. -It's dad. -Ha ha. -Who taught us all this. When they know we don't see them, dad. They're going to climb on the sideboard, fèfè. To steal, the little scoundrels, Thumper. The piggy bank where they keep their coins, cucu. -Dad made cucumber. -Dad made pan-pan cuckoo. -Ha ha. -It's mom. -Ha ha. -It's dad. -Ha ha. -Who taught us all this. -Ha ha. -It's mom. -Ha ha. -It's dad. -Ha ha. -Who taught us all this. - We're going to play ball. Children's cries. -We are getting ready. Don't be dissipated, I will crack down. M. Pichet entrusted you to me. I will form the teams. Walk away like that. Those play over there, and those play over there. - With us, Hippolyte! Children's cries. -Respect, I'm older and I'm the boss. I make the goal on both sides and I make the referee at the same time. In place ! Come on, boom! Come on, I'm hiring. Step aside, there. Attention... Hippolyte whistles. -One... Hippolyte is booed. -It does not count. -Hippolyte ! Go on ! Children's cries. -A head. Make heads. Go on ! Go on ! -Clear ! -Yeah !!! Children's cries. -And hop ! Children's cries. -Hippolyte ! -I will lose on both sides. -Hippolyte ! Well, Hippolyte! I call you. -My aunt. What else does she want? -I have something to say to you. -To me ? -It's about Javotte. -Javotte? Here, do the referee, I'm coming. Javotte ? -Approach. -You don't have your stick? - No, I did not come to beat you but to make peace. -I like this better. - I have to talk to you. -I will be back. Children's cries. -Why come here? - We will be good to chat. -Is that so. - It's not sad, at home, I should have warned you before. But I think of my daughter. -What is happening to Javotte? -What's happening to him ? She is in love with you. - In love with me? It's not possible. -I'm telling you. But I didn't want to, she's young. And marrying a cousin makes deformed children. And you are rich. -I am rich ? -With the inn, it looked like she wanted you for your money. -I'm lucky. I can not believe. Javotte really loves me? - Do you need proof? I swear to you that in front of me, she said "I love Hippolyte". - She said that? -And how ! But you slapped her, so she's stubborn. And all that gossip, and her desire to be an artist. To make a career. She would leave the country. -No ? -To make it come back to you, you have to do something. -Oh yes. -A gesture. -I'm going to kiss her. - No, a big gesture. Like a gift. -I have a piggy bank... -No, you want Javotte? -Yes. -Then give him the Trou Normand. - But I don't have it yet. -You will have it, if you have your exam. -Yes. -So ? -Ah, is it the waiver that I have to sign? - No, it's too late. And everyone would stop you, it would fall on my back. No, there must be a way. Look for. - But we have to find. How would we do well? What if I failed my exam on purpose? - Gosh, I never would have thought of that. - I will answer anything. For proof of love, it is good. -You're smarter than you think. - And the inn would be mine and Javotte's, since we would be married. -I did well to come, but not a word to anyone. -Promised. - Especially not in Javotte. She would refuse your sacrifice, ..so you don't think she wanted the inn. -Yes, it's true, she's so sensitive. So upright, so proud. - That, you can say. - Vain precautions, cruel destiny, ..I saw again the enemy that I had driven away. My too sharp wound bled. It is no longer a hidden ardor. It's all of Venus... -Thanks thanks. It is not bad at all. -I don't know anymore. -That's enough. You are very talented. But have you ever put on a peplum? - A peplum, no. - But it is important. Very important, question of shoulders. You shouldn't be too thin. -I... - Show off your cleavage. Professional look. -Like that ? -I see nothing. Release the shoulder. It's lovely. You are afraid ? -Not at all. -So tell me... Why did you choose Phèdre? You could do much more tender roles. More yourself. Little monster that we adore and for whom we would do anything. -Or the ingenues. -The white geese, they don't go far. -I want to go far. -Then... There is a test to be endured. -Oh? -Charming test. How do you kiss? -I dunno. -It's all there, the audience must see your temper. And your first audience is me. - So I have to kiss you? -Exactly. I could have done it, but you would have had a start. I want a lover's kiss. -Sure. -Kiss Me. Go for it. Kiss Me. Is that kissing? I'll show you, silly. Doorbell. - Damn, it's... - Say... - My coal merchant, run away. One. I'll prepare your contract for you. Wait until I call you. -Bye. -Yes. Oh, that one! -Hello, Mrs. Maria, here is the postman. - Not too much paperwork? -Yes, the double, Grandma. Newspapers. There is a scroll and letters. -My God ! -There is this. All of this is for you. -Lord! This will be used to light the stove. -Is it working for Hippolyte? The exam is approaching. - His head will burst. But here is your drop. - Thank you, it's not a refusal. He must be smart now. -I can't talk about it. I talk about onions, he talks to me about Charlemagne. -Hello, is Hippolyte there? -There are those too. Journalists, photographers. They are all asking for something. - No, I offer. -What ? -If he poses for us and if he signs, ..the house of the "Éclair" pen offers one. -Others came before you. He has 14 pens, one of which is real gold. And fridges, washing machines... Even a car that we're going to give him. So... - Yes, yes. Arrange for him to come. He's not going to school on Thursday. -He doesn't have a Thursday. He has more lessons. I'm going to see if he's finished with Louis XVI. -To be. -Calculate the thickness of the sand. -Hippolyte. You have to pose for pens. -I have some to spare. Now I want... - What? -A ring and earrings. -What for ? -Hein ? Nothing. I said that to cause. -He is delirious. -Let's go back, calculate the thickness of the layer of sand. -Do you really care about it? -You don't like your job anymore. -It's not that I don't like him anymore, but he amuses me less. - But you reach the goal and you have to whip. We have the surface, the volume and the weight of the sand. Calculate its thickness. - But those are jokes. -Jokes ? -Yes. Suppose I set foot on the sand... The thickness has changed. -I'm going to get mad. - No, you're too nice. - What a sass. - Isn't it thanks to you that I got all my crosses? And that I know that Charlemagne dispensed justice under an oak tree? - It's not Charlemagne, it's Saint Louis! Come on, we still have to work, let's start again. - The thickness of the sand is difficult. Was it really Saint Louis? -Let's resume. -Go on. - Come back with your certificate. - Yes, mother. - I entrust you my little guy. - Don't do like last year. He honks. -Dear Pitcher. -Hello doctor. - Your candidate is well. -Don't worry about me. -Madeleine, let's see the results of your efforts. - Have you reviewed your story? - Useless. You'll see. Acclamations. -Hello ! -And he taunts us on top of the market. - Let's see the results. -No. - Yes, I know that he will not pass his exam. -Ah ? ... -Here it is ! Comments. - Let me down. Don't grab me like that. - Nervous? -A fetish? -What do you prefer ? - Will you continue? - Don't panic him! -I am used to it. -Did you sleep well ? -I have never been able to sleep soundly. -He drank ? -Hurry up. - Don't worry. See you soon. - To the success of Hippolyte. -I trust. -Me too. -If there is a God, he will not let Augustine have the last word. -How are we going to celebrate his return? - Everything is planned. Banners are ready. The reception will take place in his inn. May he win. -How will we know? -Everything is planned, we are notified by phone. We can settle down. I'm going to see Maria for the reception. -Maria, she must be at church. She must be at her 14th candle. -Saint Nicolas, let him have his school certificate. Saint Nicolas... -Here it is. -Ah ! - Did it work as you wanted? -For that, yes. -I'm proud of you. -What luck ! -A few words to the listeners of Radio Normandie. - No, because... - Yes. -Let's wait for it to be official. -In a moment, ..Hippolyte Lemoine will tell you about his exam. - Excuse me, but I see my aunt... - Did she come? -I have to talk to him. - Take it easy. She can fall stiff. -I have salts in my kit. -So ? -You will be happy. Where is Javotte? She strolls. She'll join us at the cafe, come on. Give us 2 ciders. -Yes. -Thank you. So, tell me. -I only wrote nonsense. -You did that ? -Yes. You do not have.. ..saw the little fat man with an eyeglass ask me... "Tell me the name of Louis XVI's wife." So I answer, without laughing, Marie-Antoinette. And I specify... "The Austrian", so that he would understand who I was talking about. - Wasn't she Louis XVI's wife? -Oh, aunt, you are not set, you would have had 0 too, then. Thank you. Louis XVI... Husband of Catherine de Medici. Marie Antoinette, she had been hanged a long time ago. -Ah ? It's so far. -The funniest thing is for the cities of North America. I hesitated, but I thought of Javotte. For her, I have to play dumb. It was not convenient. But very quickly, I answered Boston, Chicago, New York... -New York is from the north. -You north? And when a heat wave hits New York, is it north? -Ah ! -Hippolyte stays with his aunt for a long time. - Do you have a colleague here? -Yes. -Go find out, the radio can leave if he fails. -I go. -Javotte. I give you the inn. -You are very nice. I called Rouen. Jean-Marco hires me for 3 months. -What ? - But you have to sign the contract. -Never ! -And my artistic career? - Are you leaving for 3 months? She teases me. - You beard! - Do we talk to him about our plot? - What plot? -It's nothing. I'm going to call the notary to tell him that Hippolyte has failed. - You missed it, well done! -It's on purpose, for you. It was agreed. -With whom ? -With your mother. -Mum ? - Yes, she told me that... That we'd get married if I did that. -And you believed him? -Yes. It's not true, don't you love me? -And she told you that I love you? -Yes. Even that you adored me. -And you walked? -Yes. -Why did she say that? -To have your inn. You make me sad. Understand me, I'm not made for you, nor to live here. Tomorrow, I will leave to live my life. - So I lost everything? -No. You have friends, go find them. -I lost everything ? I lost everything. -Hello, Master Poussin? He is not there ? Where ? A Courteville. On his return, tell him to go to Trou Normand for the succession. With the 2nd envelope. Me, I call the Courteville cabin to reach him. Thank you. Hello Miss, I would like the Courteville cabin. -Honor to Hippolyte. Put that banner up, I'll take care of the flags. -Right now. -News ? -No. -I have the hay to go home. -And me, my potatoes. -Wait, we will soon be fixed. -Guys, Hippolyte missed. - It's not true, not possible! -Augustine called, we have to tell the notary. -What do we do ? -Get the hell out of here. Kids, go play with the banners, the flags. - There is no good God! -No, surely. Oh, he missed. Oh ! -I lost everything, the certificate, Javotte. -Pardon. It is received! -He will be happy. - The inspector said that was it. -Let's look for Hippolyte. -And I'll call Testu. -I lost everything. Lost everything. -So ? -I have seen nothing. -Pitcher? -Nothing at all. -Where is he ? -Something has to be done. -I'm taking my car. -I continue. - We're catching you. -Excuse me, haven't you seen a young man in grey? With a beret. -You saw it ? -No. -Ah, a guy went to the left. -Thank you. Klaxon. -Excuse me, didn't you see a young man in gray with a beret? - Yes, he was going there. -Thank you. -Hippolyte ! -I lost everything. -Hippolyte ! Hippolyte ! He is down there. -Let's get him. -Hippolyte ! -What are you doing here ? -Leave me! -Hippolyte ! -It's true, I'm an idiot, I missed everything. - But he's crazy! - You are received. -It's true ? - Yes, you have your certificate. -It's true ? -Yes. -Come on, get on! - And you answered well. -Truly ? -But yes. Is it really me? -Yes. -It's like that. -Eh yes. -To say that it is Augustine who will have the inn. - She will kick Hippolyte out. - What will the reactionaries say? -Poor Hippolyte, it's not fair. It's not fair. -No. -Cheers. - Yes, health. - That's it, he passed the exam. -No ! - Miss Pichet called me. -Bravo ! -And Augustine's call? - She got us. We weren't suspicious. I fired the marching band. And the banners. Banners. He is received, Hippolyte is received! Oh oh oh ! Janine, go break the good news. You, go tell Maria to bring out her cocktail. Task to collect flags. - The little ones are here, I'll take them. -The flags ! Flute! I fired the marching band. -I'm looking for some? -Yes that's it. Marching band music. Acclamations. -Hippolyte ! -Here it is ! Fanfare and cheers. -Hippolyte ! -Silence ! Thanks ! Hippolyte, I congratulate you on behalf of the inhabitants of Courteville. You are like their child. Cheers and fanfare. -Why this uproar? - Your nephew has his certificate. -What ? The donkey! -He got you good. - It's not over, I haven't said my last word! He thinks it's going to be like that! Brouhaha. - I raise my glass to the symbolic courage of Hippolyte Lemoine. - Well done, Hippolyte! -Who, despite the pitfalls of all kinds, ..completed an unusual task. Find the child in him to be the man his uncle wanted. -Bravo ! -Let's not forget to associate our teacher with this success. Our friend Pitcher. Acclamations. -As well as Madeleine, whose devotion is an example. Acclamations. -The brave Maria who hatched our Felix. Acclamations. -And all of you, who have never doubted the late genius.. ..and early gifts from Hippolyte. Acclamations. -I don't understand anything, on the exam I made a mistake on purpose. -Don't say it, there is a good God for big children. -Mademoiselle Madeleine, is the elementary certificate difficult? -Why ask me that? -It's not that I want to pass it... It would be my pleasure to have you with me, to work. -So, boss, are you happy? - Am I happy? It's like in a fairy tale. -Here is Carabosse. -Hippolyte ! -If it's to kiss me, I don't want to. - Come, the notary is waiting for you. - Mrs. Lemoine, this is not the time. -We have to open a second envelope. The notary is waiting. -Let him come in. Let him come and toast. -Yes ! -Let him read here, I have nothing hidden. -You'll see ! -Ooh it is! - What's in the envelope? -She has to go to school too? - No jokes, I quit. He honks. - Oh you, I'm coming right away. -Hippolyte Lemoine, widow Augustine Lemoine, approach. We read the document. -Le document ? -Oh ! -Chut! To be opened after the exam. - "But if Hippolyte is stupid enough to miss his certificate, ..like me... - But I got it. -Hush! -Let him take the inn anyway. Hustle and fanfare. MFP captioning.
