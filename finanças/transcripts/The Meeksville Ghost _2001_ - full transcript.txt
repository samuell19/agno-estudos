(MultiCom Jingle) (suspenseful music) (bullets thudding) (country folk music) - No Lucius, please, no. I'll go with you. Please, I love you. We can leave tonight. - It's too late. - The deeds, take the deeds. The town can be yours, I'm yours. Just leave Joshua alone. - It's gone too far. He won't back down. - Then you back down. I thought you loved me. - And I always will. (suspenseful music) - No, oh Josh! Please, Josh come home, please. It's not worth it. - [Joshua] No, Isobel. - I'll marry you just like you always wanted. - Listen, it's too late for that. - We'll start again somewhere. - I've worked too hard to make this town what it is. I can't walk away. Listen to me, you've gotta understand. I've gotta see this through, or I can never look you in the eyes again. - Then leave it to the law. - What law? Frank, take her. - [Isobel] No. - [Joshua] Just go. - Please. - [Joshua] Go, Isobel. - No, please! - [Joshua] Take her Frank, get her outta here, get her outta her, go. - [Isobel] No! - Leave or die Lucius. - Don't talk, draw. - [Isobel] Lucius, no! (guns firing) (dramatic music) - [Man] She's dead! - No, no, no! - I warned you Carter, you should've listened. Why didn't you listen? - Damn you to hell, Lucius. You'll not walk away from this. I swear by all that's holy. Alive or dead, you will know no peace until you have righted the wrong that you've, you've done. - No. - No peace, Lucius, alive or dead. (dramatic music) - No (crying), no, no! (upbeat country folk music) (Danny screams) (Danny grunting) - Hey, hey, hey lady, come back here, hey! Ah, damn it! Damn it! (bike engine clicking) Come on! (Danny grunts) Damn it! (country folk music) - Having trouble? - No, I love pushing my bike up a steep hill in the blazing sun. - Touchy. - Sorry, it's been a bad day. - Well, maybe I can help. Where you headed? - Meeksville. - Me too. Look um, why not throw your bike in the back, and I'll give you a ride. - Yeah, yeah, great. - You're not from around here? - No, I was raised in California. - Poor you. - Thanks, but I managed. - Kate. - Danny, Daniel Logan. - So, what brings you out here? - Ah, work, family. Well, I'm looking for some anyway. - What, work? - No, family. I work for Diller Incorporated, surveying the old gold mines. - Diller, you work for Diller? - Yeah. - I should've known. Of all the lowdown, dirty. I suppose Emily put you up to this. - Who, hey, what's the problem? - What's the problem? You are, you and your damn company. You think you can waltz in here and destroy people's lives? Well, I'm not gonna let you. Meeksville was fine until Emily brought in people like you. - What? Wait a minute, that's uncalled for. I mean, what in the hell did I ever do to you? - Now look look, hey, there's no problem, hey. (whip snaps) Watch it! - You're not welcome here, all right. Put that in your survey. (whip snaps) - Watch it! - Snakes get what they deserve around here. - You know what? I'll just walk, okay? - Yeah, damn right you will. - [Danny] Geez. (Danny grunts) (upbeat country folk music) (horn blowing) - Emily, Emily. Oh, I know it's hard. Without the title deeds, we can't make a sale. Those are the best looking forgeries I've ever seen, and the beauty of it is there's no need for anyone to check. They all think you own the land anyway. - (laughing) Yeah, everyone, except the Carters. - Then clear 'em out. You got all the leases covered except the saloon. - I know, I know. - [Walsh] So? - They're being stubborn. - Six million, Emily, is a lot of money. Your father would've ran them out by now. - My father is dead, thank God. - We'll never get a chance like this again. - I know, but five days. I mean, can't you just give me a little more time? - No, look, it's all set for Sunday morning. Diller and half the press corps of Texas are coming here to sign the biggest defense contract issued since the war. We can't let anything get in our way. Look, I've done my bidding. You got the deeds now, so do yours. Get rid of the Carters. Whatever it takes. Get rid of 'em. (dramatic music) No more loose ends Emily. Get rid of 'em. - [Emily] You can count on it. - Excuse me, I'd like a word with you. Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you. You almost killed me this morning. - What are you talking about? - You know very well what I'm talking about. You and that horse ran me off the road. Hey, are you listening? - Frankly, no. - Well, what I said was that you and your horse ran me off the road. Nearly destroyed my bike, and you're damn well gonna pay for it lady. - Talk to my lawyer. - Meeks, Emily Meeks. What a friendly little town this is. - Ox, forget the fence. Get over here, things have changed, and it's gonna take a lot more than a wire fence to fix them. (upbeat country folk music) - [Danny] Hello, hello! (mysterious music) - Why, hello. (laughs) Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. - It's all right. - Can I help you? - I hope so, I'm looking for a room and a gas station. - Well, rooms we got. Gas stations, we're fresh out of. - Why did I have a feeling you might say that? - Never was a big place. Not much left either. Still want a room? - [Danny] Yeah. - Then follow me. Sign the register first, if you please. You come a long way? - [Danny] Oh, it's been a longer trip than you can imagine. - Sign here and then we'll get you up to your room. This is the only hotel in town, but you won't do better. Beds are soft, the linens clean. - Wow, electricity and running water. - Oh sure, we've even got our own ghost. - I don't believe in ghosts. - (chuckles) They all say that. Dinner's at eight. Yell if you need anything. (mysterious music) - Get a grip Danny, get a grip. My love always. (mysterious music) (wind whooshing) (mysterious music) (Danny screams) (Lucius screams) Who are you? - Can you see me? - Of course I can see you. How'd you get in here? - Can you see me? (Danny screams) Idiot. - Yes, but he works for Diller, Gran. How could you let him stay here? - Because he seems like a nice fellow. Anyway, I gave him the Mississippi room. - (chuckles) Gran. - He's rather good looking, don't you think? - Gran, don't start that again. - You know I'm quite happy on my own. I don't need complications in my life right now. - I know sweetie, but I do worry about you. If anything should happen to me, you'll be alone. - Gran, I can take care of myself. Speak of the devil. - And up she pops. - I live here, all right. You're the guest, so be civil or be poisoned. - Oh, you're the cook? - No, actually, Granny is. - Thank God for that. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing, it just means that you can stay the hell away from me, all right? - Yeah, well, that suits me just fine. - Fine. - Good. - Good. - [Kate] Good. - [Granny] What happened to you? - Oh, I uh, I just bumped my head. Had a nightmare. - Can I get you something to drink? - Yeah, sure, that'd be great. (electricity sizzling) (mysterious music) Now what? - [Kate] Gran? - Oh, I'm fine, get the fuses, I'll light some candles. - [Kate] All right. - [Danny] Can I help? I said, can I help? - [Granny] No, we can manage. - You sure? - Well, you could help change the fuses. - Yeah, no problem. Where are they? - Over there. - [Danny] Okay, where? - [Kate] Okay, right, right here. (ladder thuds) - Ow! Ow, what? - Do you want me to do this? - No, I don't want you to do it. - Okay, the fuse box is right up there. - Really, is that why we put the ladder here? - Okay, you're gonna have to stand on the top step. - [Danny] I realize that. Will you give me a chance to get up there? All right, now hold it still. It gets wobbly up here. Here, hold it still, this ladder's-- - All right, don't be such a baby. (telephone ringing) I'm gonna have to get that. - [Danny] No, no, Kate, just stay there. Just leave the phone alone. - I'll be right back. - [Danny] Kate, Kate. (telephone ringing) (wind whooshing) (glass crashing) (suspenseful music) - [Lucius] It's about time. - [Danny] Who said that? - I said, it's about time. Boo! (Danny screams) Ouch, that had to hurt. You're gonna have to stop crashing into things son. - Who are you? - Can't you read boy? There's a big old sign out there, says who I am. You just busted in on my office. - It's my head, I banged my head. All right, you have a concussion Danny. You have a concussion. Either that or you're gone crazy, damn it. - Don't say that. - Damn it. - I said, don't. - Why, you're not even real. I can say. Why don't you leave me alone? - I would if I could, believe me, but I need help. Even your help. - My help, why? - Because I'm cursed, why else? Cursed to wander the nether regions. Stuck between life and death. Never to find peace in this world or the next. Cursed to silently watch as life goes on around me, til I'm ready to run that is. - This is crazy, why me? - [Kate] Danny, Danny. (wind whooshing) Gran, quick. - Damn it! - [Lucius] I said stop saying that. - I'll be damned! (Lucius scoffs) Danny, Danny! - I'm here, I'm over here. - What happened? - What happened? Um, you let go of the ladder. - What? - You let go of the ladder and I fell. - Oh, so, this is my fault? - Yes. - My goodness, what happened? - He wrecks the place, pulls down half the wall, and has the gall to blame me. - I didn't. - [Kate] See? - No, I mean, I didn't blame you. - Oh, never mind about that. Danny, are you okay? - Yeah, I think I am, yeah. If you could just give me a hand out of here. - Be careful. You klutz, do you know how valuable that mirror is? Was, it was over a hundred years old. It's irreplaceable. - I appreciate your concern Kate. Did you see him? - Who? - The ghost. - What? - I better see to that cut of yours. I think you must've hit your head harder than you think you did. - Gran, do you know who's room this was? - No, not at all. - It's was Lucius Meeks office. - Oh, and how do you know? - He told me. - Crazy. (upbeat country folk music) - Unbelievable, I almost get myself killed, and all I get is, well, that mirrors valuable. Here's valuable. All right Danny, get a grip. Get a grip Danny, before you start seeing werewolves too. (mysterious music) Thank you. - [Lucius] You're welcome. - [Danny] What? - Oh, for goodness sake, relax. I'm not gonna hurt you. Why would I hurt you? I told you I need your help. - What for? - Catch the bad guys. Save the town. Get the girl, and lift the curse that haunts me. - So, what's it got to do with me? Bad guys mean trouble I don't need. This town I hate, and the girl you can keep. - (chuckles) Now, that you don't mean. - Damn right I do. Do you have to blow that in my face? Haven't you ever heard of cancer? - Yeah, I've heard of it. I died of it, and I don't have to worry about it anymore. - Yeah, well I do, so don't blow it on me. Look I'm gonna fix my bike, and I'm outta here. - I can't believe you're gonna leave a helpless, old lady, and her innocent granddaughter to the mercy of Emily Meeks and her thugs. Yeah, innocent. Boy, she got you fooled. If I was you, I'd be concerned about Emily's safety, not Kate's. - (chuckles) Well, she likes you. - Oh yeah, right. Take a look at me, I look like I've gone 10 rounds with Tyson. - Well, you know the old saying, we hurt the most the one's we love. - Give me a break. - What about me? How will I lift this curse if you leave. - So now we're getting down to it. This isn't about Kate and her Gran, it's about you. - That's not true. - Oh no, would have helped them when you were alive? I didn't think so. Whatever you did to get your curse, I'm sure you deserved it. I'm gonna fix my bike and leave. - Why you chicken-livered ball of cat spit. You're running away. You haven't got the guts to stay and fight. Poor little Danny better run home to mommy. - [Danny] That's enough (grunts)! - Well, you even fight like a mama's boy. - You better leave my mom outta this (grunts). I'm leaving. - Fine, where we going? - [Danny] What? - I said, where we going? - Oh no, we're not going anywhere. - I'm going, you're staying. - Oh no, if you leave, I'm doomed to stay like this forever, so I might as well go with you. Make your life a living hell. - You wouldn't dare. - Try me. (glass crashing) Sounds like your girlfriend needs a little help. - She's not my girlfriend. (glass crashing) - Take the money. - No! - 25 thousand dollars. It's more money than you'll ever see. Think what you could-- - Forget it Emily, we're going nowhere. - 30 thousand, that's my final offer. - We're not scared of you Emily, or these two morons. - Yeah, well, you should be. You show them why they should be. (dramatic music) (Ox grunting) (glass crashing) - Hey, hey! - Danny! - Danny? - That's enough. - You stay out of this, boy. - I can't do that. - Emily, you stop this right now. - Then you take the cash. - It's all right Gran, I can handle these two. - Sully, get rid of him. (glass crashing) (fist thudding) (Ox grunting) (Lucius grunting) (upbeat country folk music) - Danny! (Ox and Lucius screaming) (upbeat country folk music) (Ox screaming) (glass crashing) (upbeat country folk music) (Ox screaming) (upbeat country folk music) - Get him Ox, get him! You're finished. - Oh, really? (pan thudding) (upbeat country folk music) (pan thudding) - Oops. (glass crashing) - (chuckles) Most fun I've had in a hundred years. (wind whooshing) - (grunts) Ah, my head. - Shh, lie still. - Ox, where's Ox? - Gone. - Gone. - He's gone? - Yes, gone. You were wonderful. - (chuckles) Told you she liked you. - Shut up. - Sorry, I, I, I just wanted to thank you for your help. - Oh no, not, I'm sorry, I wasn't uh. I was um, are you all right? - [Kate] Mm hmm. - [Danny] Yeah? - [Kate] Mm hmm. - (grunts) My head. What hit me? - Um actually, I did. It was an accident. I was trying to help. - Thanks, ever since I've gotten to this town, I've been dodging bullwhips, crashing bikes, fighting morons, chasing ghosts. - Well, it's partly your own fault, you know. I mean, you're the one who works for Diller. - What's that got to do with it? - Emily's selling this town to Diller, and she wants us out. - I didn't know that, I'm sorry. Listen, I'm just a part-time consultant, you know. They brought me in to survey the mines, find out how deep they are. Why don't you and your grandma just take the money and run? It doesn't seem like a whole lot in this town holding you back. - Why should we? I mean, our family founded this town. - She's right, they did. - And then the thieving Meeks came in and stole the lot. - It wasn't quite like that. - So, Lucius was a thief? - Yes. - No. - Tell me more. - Well, the town was founded by my great, great grandfather, Joshua Carter. He came here during the gold rush, and he struck it rich selling equipment to miners. He built this town. He was the one who called it Liberty. (light guitar music) Gran says he did it all for the woman he loved. (light guitar music) He was really happy until the sharpshooting competition brought Lucius Meeks to Liberty. Everything changed. (light guitar music) - For the worse. - Damn right. Lucius and his men moved into this very saloon. Started shooting up the town, bullying, corrupting, claim jumping, you name it. Everything short of murder. (upbeat country folk music) (guns firing) Then Lucius goaded Joshua into betting everything he owned on the outcome of the shooting competition. The loser was to ride out of town and never come back. - And why on earth would Joshua have done that? - Because someone in the town had to stop Lucius from taking over. He was willing to risk everything he had in order to save what he built, and to make it worse. Lucius was trying to steal Isobel away from Joshua. Even though she wouldn't have anything to do with him. - And I guess Joshua lost the contest. - Yeah, but Joshua was a man of honor. - Yeah, right. - He had no choice except to call Lucius out for a real gunfight. - Which he also lost. - He lost the bet, he should've left. - It's even worse than that. In a jealous rage, Lucius also killed Isobel, and with no one left to stop him, he laid claim to the town and everything in it. - Which now leaves you and Gran to the tender mercies of Emily. There's gotta be something that we can do. - No, we've tried and tried, but we can't prove anything. The only thing that would help us is if we found the original deeds, but when Lucius took over he hid them, so no one could dispute his claim. I don't think there's a corner of this town I haven't looked in or under to find them. I'm gonna make some coffee. - Okay. - (chuckles) How history lies. She got it all wrong. - Yeah, I bet, but we'll never know, will we? - Wanna know what happened? I'll show you what happened. (Danny grunting) (wind whooshing) - Wait, where are we? - Liberty in 1878. You wanted to know what happened, here it is. See for yourself. - Take me back Lucius. - You're real, outta time, but you're real. I'm the ghost. - Hey, you take me back Lucius, right now. - Look. (boxes thudding) That's how we met. (Isobel giggles) (light guitar music) - Get your hands off her. - Ma'am. (suspenseful music) - I don't understand. - You will. - Oh no, oh no Lucius, no, no, no! (Isobel giggling) (light guitar music) - We were in love. Why would I have shot her? - Because she was suppose to marry someone else, and you were jealous that she wouldn't leave him. (light guitar music) - Never. (wind whooshing) - We're back, no, no, you take me back there. You show me more Lucius, you show me the end. - Danny, coffee's getting cold. Danny, Danny, you all right? You look a little shook up. - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. (Emily groaning) - Oh, move fools, oh! - But, but, but boss. What do we do now? - Shut up, just shut up, will you, let me think. Who is he? - I think his, his name's Danny. - I know who he is, you idiot. What's he doing here? - Uh, he's working for Diller surveying the mine. - Ox, I want you to go and see Diller, and I want you to get him fired. Sully, I want you to keep an eye on the saloon. I wanna know where they go. I wanna know what they do. I wanna know when they breath. - The saloon? - Yeah, the saloon. What? - The saloon boss, uh, I don't, I don't think, I mean that I, what happened there wasn't right. - Wasn't right? - Yeah boss, the saloon is kinda spooky. - [Both] Haunted. - Oh (giggles). (Sully and Ox chuckling) I don't believe it! Two grown men afraid of their own shadows. Well, let me give you something else to worry about. If Kate finds out what we plan to do with those fake deeds before we sign with Diller, not only will you two say goodbye to your share of the six million, but you will spend the next 20 years of your life behind bars. - I'll head on down to the saloon then. (upbeat country folk music) - Where are those biscuit heads off to? - Who knows? Wherever it is, it won't be good for us. - Us? - I don't have a choice, do I? - I guess not. (Lucius chuckles) (Danny chuckles) (light guitar music) - Thanks. - Sure, so, you see anything in here yet? - Not yet, most of its just junk. Letters, newspapers, catalogs. (wind whooshing) You know, I don't think he ever threw anything away. - No, except maybe his life. - What about you? - Me, I'm not throwing my life away. - No, I mean, I know nothing about you. Why you're here. Why you're helping us. - Well, it's a long story. - [Kate] I've got all day. (light guitar music) - I'm uh, I'm looking for my mother and my father. I was adopted when I was a kid, and it never really bothered me that they weren't my real parents, but last year when my old man died, I um. - Oh, I'm sorry. - No, it's, it's okay, it's okay. I mean they um, they were great people, you know. They had a, they had a great life, and they were older when they adopted me anyway, so. - Do you miss them? - Very much. (light guitar music) - [Granny] Kate. - Great timing, coming. (wind whooshing) - Find anything? - Um, not really. Most of it's just junk. - Here, have a look. (whimsical country folk music) - [Kate] I don't believe it. - What? - It's Lucius's diary. Listen to this. "It's been six weeks since Isobel passed on. "I feel as though a dark hole has opened in me, and swallowed everything." Passed on? That's a good one, he shot her. - Did he? I mean, can we be sure of that? Go ahead and read on a little bit. See if it says anything else. - I don't have to. Lucius was a Meeks and they're all the same. Always have been, always will be. - [Granny] Not all Kate. Emily was a lovely young girl. - Was, is right. - Don't judge, till life gives you some lessons in sympathy girl. You never knew her father. He was a real Meeks. Never knew a day when he didn't terrorize someone into doing something he shouldn't oughta, or didn't wanna. - Sounds like a chip off the old block. (wind whooshing) - I think you've upset someone. - Pretty little thing she was and a beautiful young woman. She used to hang out with your Pa, I recall, and Abe Williams boy. (chuckles) Them two were as tight as can be, until they crashed Abe's car. The boy died. Nothing was the same after that. Then one day, she must've been about 19, I recall, she ups and leaves without a bye or leave. - Where'd she go? - California, I think, then England. Her daddy said growing up around here was no place for a lady. He wanted his little girl to have a real education. Seems like the town started to die right around then. - I won't let them destroy this town Gran. It's all you've got. - (chuckles) Oh, no sweetie, I've got you. But for all that, this town shouldn't be turned into a firing range. Too many people loved it, and died for it. - But if it's finished, I mean, if everything's closed, why keep it going? Why not let it die with dignity? - Typical, worried you're gonna get fired? - No, not worried I'm gonna get fired. I was wondering why you wanna save this town so much. - Because this town is part of our heritage. It's one of the last remaining frontier towns in the West. People love this place. They could make it work if they just give it a chance. - This paper's got a list of claim numbers on it. Maybe ones to do with the land this town stands on. - Here, let me have a look at that. See, I don't understand why Lucius would've hid the deeds in the first place. It doesn't make sense. - What do you mean? - I mean, he would want them, right? To support his claim. - Okay, what're you saying? - I'm saying that what if it wasn't Lucius who hid them? What if it was Joshua or, or a friend of Joshua's, after he died to stop Lucius. - Okay, but even if you're right, it doesn't help us find them. - Maybe not, but if you were a friend of Joshua's, and you wanted to stop Lucius, where would you hide them? Someplace Lucius never found them. Someplace you never found them. Someplace no one would think to look. Think about it. You're a friend of Joshua's, you're upset. You know about the bet. You know Lucius is gonna push until he takes what he thinks is his. You know Joshua's not gonna back down. What do you do with them? - I'd bury them. You're kidding right? In Joshua's grave? - Could be. - Yeah, but even if someone did bury them, we can't just dig them up, can we? - I don't really see what other option we've got. I mean, you've looked everywhere else. - Do you know where Joshua was buried? - In the town cemetery, but I think we should let the dead rest in peace. - I think if we sort this whole mess out the dead will find some peace, don't you? (wind whooshing) - So, when do we do it? - Whatcha lookin' at? - [Sully] Huh? (Sully screams) - Tonight. (Sully screaming) (body thudding) - What was that? (Sully screaming) (wind whooshing) - Whatcha lookin' for? (head thuds) (Danny grunts) - Where is it? - What? - The deed, don't play dumb. Where's the deed? - Well, if what you just told them is true, I wouldn't know, would I? To lift the curse, I've got to persuade a direct descendant to give back what I had-- - Stole? - Acquired. - Acquired, yeah, right. Either way, you've got no chance, because Emily's not gonna give back anything. - No, I never thought she would. - And Kate and her Gran, same thing. - Well, they're not my descendants. - Well then, it looks like you're flat outta luck. - Oh, I wouldn't say that. - [Danny] Hey. - [Kate] Hi. - [Danny] Do you have one? - [Kate] Yeah. - [Danny] Oh, good. - [Kate] Danny, are you, are you sure about this? - No, but it will take me awhile to dig up that grave, so there's no sense in you just sitting around. Any information you can get on those claim numbers might help us, if the deeds not in the grave. - Okay, well, I'll have my phone if you need me. Good luck. (Kate giggles) (mysterious music) - No offense Joshua, I'm doing this for you. - Psst! Scared of ghosts? - Very funny. - You're convinced the deed is in there then. - No, I'm not, so if you have a better idea, I'd love to hear it. Thought not. (light guitar music) - No. Damn. Yes. - Oh, come on. It doesn't give you the right to steal someone else's wife. - Shoot them. - Shh. - [Danny] You just sit there, huh? I mean, no rest for the dead, huh? - Who's he talking too? - Shh, let's get closer so we can hear, shh. - Lucius, who are you convincing, me or yourself? Love, love, right, so that gives you the right to destroy someone else's life? (mysterious music) - You're too young to understand. - I think I understand perfectly, actually. Lucius has to get what Lucius wants, and to hell with anyone else. Even those he says he loves. - What makes you so different, huh? Are you doing this to help Kate and her Granny, or to find out who your mother is? Maybe it's the best way to get the girl. (Danny scoffs) You and I aren't so different. - Broom, hand me the broom. Quick, give me that broom. (mysterious music) Thanks. - Don't mention it. (mysterious music) - Thanks for the warning. - Don't mention it. - Eh, excuse me? - What do you want? - Want (chuckles)? Oh, you're such a dear boy. Thank you for asking, but I have all I want. I'm here to make sure that I keep it, and that includes whatever is in that coffin. - Doesn't belong to you. - Really, well, is it there? - You know what lady? You want it, you come down and get it yourself. (suspenseful music) - Out of there. (suspenseful music) Ox, hang onto him, Sully. - [Sully] Yeah? - See if the deed's in there. - (grunts) Me? - Get on with it. Anything? - Eh, no, just a lot of rags and bones. - Well, well, check up by the skull. - Huh? - Come on, we haven't got all night. - Watch this (chuckles). (Sully screams) (foot thuds) (Ox screams) (upbeat country folk music) Nighty, night, don't let the bedbugs bite. (Danny and Lucius chuckle) - Bingo. - So, tell me why you're such a nasty lady. - I'm not, just making sure I keep what's mine, that's all. - Must be a family trait. Doesn't it matter to you who else gets hurt? - Why should it? You know, my father, he taught me a long time ago that only the strong win, and we Meeks are strong. - And what a jerk he was. - What about your conscience? Doesn't your conscience bother you? Don't you have any regrets? - You have no idea what I regret, and my conscience is my business. You know, life is not a bowl of cherries. In fact, it's a rather large bowl of pits. Sometimes you have to make choices. You have to do things you don't wanna do, and you have to live with the consequences. Now, I'm going home. (metal scrapping) (Lucius chuckling) (Sully and Ox screaming) - Ah, don't run off. The night's still young (chuckles). - You sure about this? - Yes, you just keep watch, okay. - Look, Danny, this is pointless. I mean, if Emily did have anything which leads to the deeds, she would've found them already. - [Danny] Thanks. - No, I'm not being negative, it's just trying to be realistic. - We're in, let's go. - Great. - Here, hold that. (mysterious music) - Hurry up, hurry up. (Sully grunts) Can you help me? Come on, come on, come and help me. - Give me your hand. (mysterious music) Spooky. - Look over there. - Uh, what exactly am I looking for, boss? - Can you talk any louder? - Uh, what exactly am I looking-- (hand thuds) - Any clue (scoffs) Anything that will help us find the real deed, go. (Sully grunts) (glass crashing) (mysterious music) - There's nothing here. What're you thinking? - The safe? - Could be, let's take a look, ready? - [Kate] Yeah. - [Danny] Bingo. (light guitar music) (upbeat country folk music) - You got company. - [Danny] Shh. - I didn't say anything. (door thudding) - Told ya. (upbeat country folk music) - Come here, come here, quick, hide. - Where? - Get down, just get down. (upbeat country folk music) - Hey, what are you. (Ox grunts) - Fore! - [Danny] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Thanks. - How did you do that? - Ah, it's a long story. - Go ahead, why don't you just tell her? - Shut up. - Huh? - Ah nothing, I was just talking to him. - Who? - Lucius, or Lucius's ghost. - Oh boy, now you done it. - What? - He's standing right next to you with a stupid grin on his face. - I don't see anybody. (hand thuds) Watch it! - Hey! Hey, leave her alone. Pass me the rope. - Maybe I'll just let her think you're a nut case. - Will you cut it out. - What did I do? - I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to him. - Who? - Pass the rope. (upbeat country folk music) - You owe me pal. (Ox grunting) - Kate? - Nothing, absolute rubbish, all of it, let's go. (Granny and Sully scream) - All right, come on, let's get outta here. - Okay. Danny, you okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm coming. (water splashing) (Sully groans) - Eh, what happened? - You fainted moron. - Ah. Oh, it's her, I thought it was-- - I know what you thought. Let's get outta here now. - Gran, Gran, are you all right. - I must've fainted. - Fainted, come here. Let's get her up here. Come here, come here, sit here. - What happened? - I saw Sully and Emily. - Emily, that's it. This time she's gone too far. - [Danny] Wait Kate, hey, hey, slow down a minute. Let Gran finish. Let's find out what happened first. - As I was saying, Sully and Emily were in the office. I didn't know and boy did I get a fright when I saw them. I must've fainted. - See, this time she's gonna pay. I'm getting my gun. - Your gun, hey, hey, come on now. Don't be stupid, Kate. Guns don't solve anything. - [Granny] Listen to him, he's right Kate. - Come on, calm down, all right. Don't do something you're gonna regret, because that's exactly what she wants. Your Gran is fine. Somebody even made her comfortable. I don't think Emily wanted her hurt. - Don't be stupid. Of course Emily wanted to hurt her. What do you think this is about, huh? I mean, we stand in her way, and she'll do whatever it takes to get us out, and I'm not going without a fight. Come on Gran, let's go. I'll get you to your room. I'll make you some mint tea, all right? Are you feeling better? - [Granny] Mm hmm. - [Kate] Good. - You'll chase him away if you don't curve that temper of yours. - I don't care. - You do. - Gran, why did he have to take her side? - He didn't, all he was doing was trying to stop you from doing something foolish. He cares about you. - Do you really think so? - (chuckles) Oh, and you don't? Oh, go on, go give him a big kiss and make him. - Gran. (Granny and Kate giggle) - My mom was in a car crash in another town. Emily Meeks escaped with a few minor injuries, but her boyfriend did not. - What's it say? - [Danny] It's about Emily. - Oh, and? - It says here that when she was a teenager she was in a car crash, and her boyfriend died. - I'm sorry, a boy should know his parents, good or bad. - You think she left me because my father died? (glass crashing) - She's your mother? Emily is your mother? - I think so. - You think so, and just when were you gonna tell me about your suspicions, huh, or is it none of my business? - No, I would've said something as soon as I was sure. I mean, what difference does it make? - Leave me alone. Wait, is that why we went to her office? So you could find out who you are? - Partly, yes. - I've been so stupid. What else are you hiding? What else are you not telling me? - Nothing. - You're lying. - [Danny] I'm not lying. - You want the deeds for yourself, don't you? So you can sell the land. That's why you sent me to the library. - Come on Kate, now you are being stupid. - Am I? It's very convenient you turn up now. Long lost son to claim his inheritance. You make me sick. - I make you sick? How about you little Miss high and mighty, self-righteous Carter. Last of the long line of whining losers. You know what? At least the Meeks aren't afraid to go after what they want. They're not afraid to live. They don't sit around thinking the world owes them a favor. (hand thuds) - Boy, you sure got a way with women. - Drop dead. (engine roaring) Outta my way. - So, you're running away. - Just move, I'll drive right through ya. - I'll move after you hear what I have to say. - Not interested. - Don't do it Danny. Don't let your pride get the best of you. Let me give you the benefit of a hundred and thirty years of regret. It was pride that made me stay when I could've left. Even if it wasn't me who shot her. It was my pride that killed Isobel. It's up to you. (engine roaring) (wind whooshing) (engine roaring) (Danny screaming) (bike crashing) (thunderous explosion. - Danny, no! - Thanks for dropping in. - That was funny. You can not keep doing this. What're we doing here? - The 8th of May, 1878. The day the devil came to call. You wanted to know how it ended. Wanna see what pride will get ya? Look. - Stop this, Lucius. - I can't. - Well, try. - I have a thousand times. - [Isobel] No! - Kate. - Oh Josh, please, come home. Please, it's not worth it. - No, Isobel. - I'll marry you just like you wanted. - It's too late for that. - [Isobel] We'll start again somewhere. - You can stop this Lucius. You can stop this, nobody has to die. - Weren't you listening to me? I can't stop it. I didn't shoot Isobel, Josh did. Even if I don't fire, Isobel still dies. - Then leave it to the law. - What law? Frank, take her, go on, get her outta here, get her outta here, go. - No! - This is the real curse. Watching this over and over with no way to end it. - Leave or die Lucius. - Don't talk, draw. - You can watch it if you want, but I'm gonna do something about it. - [Isobel] Lucius, no! - Isobel, no, no, no! (guns firing) - Danny, no! (wind whooshing) (gun firing) Danny! (Lucius grunting) - Lucius, Lucius. - Danny, Danny, Danny, are you all right? - Hmm, what, what happened? - You crashed your bike. - What? - [Kate] You crashed and your bike exploded. - [Sully] No. - Emily pulled you clear, she saved your life. - How is he? - I think he'll be fine. - Thanks. - I never thought I'd see you again. When my father made me give you up, I really thought I would die. I'm so sorry for all the pain I must've caused, but I'll, I'll make it up to you, I promise. - Look. - What is it? - It's the deed. - Where did you find it? - Lucius, we did it. We did it, Kate. This is Lucius's way of telling us that we lifted the curse, nobody died. - Danny, Danny, you're concussed. - No, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm gonna go help put out the fire. - Why bother, she's just gonna destroy the town anyway. - She can't, this deed proves that the land is yours, Gran. Kate, this land is yours. - [Kate] Yeah, but she'll fight it. - Not necessarily. We could try to make it work. - We? - Yeah, we. - After all you've done? After everything you've put us through? You expect us to trust you? - Have you any idea what it is like to wake up every single morning of your life and know that you have wasted it? To have lost everyone you've ever loved? - Was this is my father? The one who died in the car? - We were young, oh, but we were so in love. We knew my father would never have approved, so we ran away to get married, and then on the way back. When my father discovered that I was pregnant, he sent me away. He arranged for you to be adopted. No one ever knew, and I wasn't in any fit state to fight him. I let you down, and I will never forgive myself. - Maybe I can forgive. - I've made some very terrible mistakes, but we have a chance here at a new beginning. Let's not waste it. - This is what you said you wanted. The chance to see this town rebuild. To see it prosper again. Maybe we can build our own future. Free of the past, free of these silly feuds. - Okay. - Yeah? - [Kate] Yes. (wind whooshing) - Bye Lucius, thanks.
