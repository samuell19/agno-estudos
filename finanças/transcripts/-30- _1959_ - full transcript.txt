[drumbeats] [title music] [music continues] Now, I want you to listen to what I'm gonna say, Collins 'cause I'm going to lay it on the line. And furthermore, I'm gonna ask questions later. Now, I don't want you to drop that a surprise but I am not the man who owns this newspaper. Not even that much of it. So, basically, I don't give two hoots and a holler whether we sell three copies or 300,000 copies except that if we don't sell 300,000 copies, then I have no job and furthermore, you have no job. And because of the conditions that prevail, Collins long before I have no job you will have become such a stranger to this sitting room that if we had dogs here, they'd bark at you, Collins. Okay, Mr. Bathgate. I'm willing to admit that I made a mistake. You are? Really? Well...you've certainly got character, boy. Not much intelligence perhaps, or ready instinct for newspaper work, but character you've got up till here. Uh, Mr. Bathgate, when I first started on this paper we were told that the most important thing they'd look for in us was initiative. I don't give a damn what they told you. They said you're working the night edition now. 3:00 to 12:00, midnight. Yes, sir, but you gotta admit, sir if it'd turned out to be legit I could've won the Pulitzer Prize for a story like that. Oh, well, there's always next year, you know. Now, Collins, where were your brains that night? Some itinerant crackpot gypsy wanders in shows you a crumpled piece of cheap wrapping paper covered with a lot of lines and some childish high school equations on it. 'Tells you that it's the top secret plan' 'for America's first manned space station.' And how did you react? You not only didn't throw him out on his ear you actually believed him. And then...you assured him that this paper would buy his phony claptrap for some ridiculous fancy sum. He didn't look like a gypsy to me, Mr. Bathgate. Why, because his ears weren't pierced? Oh, Collins, one of these days, you're gonna end up famous for owning more non-producing oil wells than anyone ever before you or since you. Well, I don't see what oil wells have to do with space stations. Get out. - 'Just a minute, Collins.' - Yes, sir, Mr. Bathgate. I don't want you to even talk to me for one week, Collins. 'And by that, I mean I don't wanna have' 'any kind of communication with you whatsoever.' If we should happen to meet each other on the way to the.. Don't you even dare nod to me, do you understand? 'That's an order Collins.' Now, get back to work. [upbeat music] [whistling] [music continues] [whistling] Boy. Boy. Do we or do we not have coffee boys on this newspaper? As far as I know, we don't. If we do, I know I haven't come across one in at least six to eight months. Yeah. Where're the little chaps' hideout? Under the building? No, I looked there one night. But you might try the ladies' room. I always wanted to, but I never had the guts. When did you manage to save up a dollar and how? Oh, Crockett, down in the composing room is making a fortune taking bets. I want to put this down on whether that Italian actress is gonna have a baby or not and what kind. But his odds are way out of line. - Boy? - How are you betting? On twins, the odds are 50 to one. And I need the money. Really? And we all thought you were the husband of one of the richest women in America and became a City editor just for a lark. Gatlin in yet? Why should he be? It's Thursday. Oh, yeah. Mr. Gatlin's not in yet, huh? What happened to your new Playboy calendar? It's Thursday. Oh, yeah. I guess I forgot. On account of the wife and I usually bowl Thursday mornings. But she ruptured herself last week. How long has Mr. Gatlin been pulling this Thursday thing? Why, are you writing New Yorker profile on him or something? No, lot of us haven't been on papers as long as you have. And, naturally, we're a little curious. I mean, who goes and puts flowers on grave every Thursday? Gatlin does, and since he's the boss what business is it of yours? It was just a question, Mr. Bathgate. Do I need Mr. Gatlin's approval to have cuts made on these? Well, now, why even ask? After all, what is Gatlin except the night managing editor? - Of course, you're kidding now. - Me? Kidding. Oh, no, no. You go ahead and you do it your way because I hear they have a very good opening for a man just like you on the Herald Express. To think, I've been feeling sorry for myself because working nights, I have to miss so many of those real good TV comedy shows. Boy. I'm not supposed to talk to Mr. Bathgate. So would you ask him if he called for a boy? Now why should I call for a boy when girls are so pretty? Tell Mr. Bathgate that I have been busy in the press room. So, they're busy in the press room, are they? Could it be that the boys are taking extension courses? Now hear this. I want you to bet this dollar in my name with Crockett on that Italian actresses' baby. Tell Mr. Bathgate that I'll be too happy to run his errands. Even though this sort of thing is not part of my job. [sarcastically] Aha aha. Which way does Mr. Bathgate want to bet his dollar? - Twins. - Twins? You better tell Mr. Bathgate that the odds are seven to five. She isn't even legally married to that guy-- Just do what you're told to do and then you can go back to that place where you all hide out and hide out again. Well, it's Mr. Bathgate's money. So he can use it for Kleenex if he wants to. - But the smart money-- - Will you get going? [comical music] Oh, what gives with these kids? I started as a copy boy and believe me we hustled like the job meant something to us. We were eager, ambitious, scared to death we weren't gonna make a place for ourselves on the paper. Yeah, but like the man said in that book he wrote "Times have changed." Well, I'll bet they never sold many copies of that book. These kids are different than we were when we started out. I'll say they are. They don't know how to move any faster than to crawl and they can make themselves invisible whenever they want to. Most of them are veterans of the Korean war. That one you were just chewing out was a sergeant with nearly as many decorations as Audie Murphy. You were in the army once, weren't you, Jim? Oh, you know damned well I was. Four long, dreary years. And I never got any higher than private first class. And I never got any closer to fighting than Fort Sill, Oklahoma which does not mean that I intend to go around feeling outranked for the rest of my life. Don't yell at me. I couldn't pull rank on a campfire girl. Let me know as soon as Sam Gatlin gets in, will you? I've got something I wanna talk to him about. You put your trust in the right boy, kid. Just let Gatlin put one foot in the door and you'll get signal faster than you can say, "Richard Harding Davis." You're pressing again, Jim. Your humor is not only forced and reachy, it's just not funny. Well, I guess that makes the rainstorm official. The lady's carrying her umbrella. That's not an umbrella, Sid. That's a parasol. Lady used to be a Mack Sennett girl, didn't you, lady? You, got your decades all mixed up again, junior. Even when the Mack Sennett girls were bowling them over I was still old enough to be, God forbid, your mother. Ah. Even so, I'll bet you were a living, breathing gasser when you were about 17. Weren't you, lady? Well, cute or ghastly, drunk or sober there isn't a man on this newspaper who could have gotten half way to first base with me. When are you going to learn to quit when you're ahead? When I get ahead for once. [thunder] [upbeat music] Sam, you're looking great. That's me, alright, Fred, a great looker. Sam, I've waited a long time for some way to show you how much our friendship means to me. Now, you know I never bypass Jim Bathgate on these things. But this little girl that I've taken on as a client. And you know how untrustworthy Jim is in this particular field. Sam. Believe me, believe me. This little girl can stop traffic in any old freeway during any old rush hour. If she ever does, let me know. I might be able to get her mentioned in auto club annual. I know what you think. You think this is just another picture of some little starlet without many clothes on, don't you? - You mean it isn't? - Well, take a look at it. If you don't replete your front page to make room for this kid.. ...I'll sell you my mother for two bets. Well, last week you sold her to me for only for 10 cents. Well, she got herself a job in a laundry since then. Aren't you even gonna look at it? No. My wife gets real psychotic if I show any interest in naked female children. So we don't tell your wife. That isn't the answer, Fred. Not the real answer. Oh. We're gonna have a news paper tonight, Jim? Oh, we're gonna have a newspaper, alright. Lots of pages with print on it. Folded together just right. Headlines in the right place, all that sort of stuff. Anything interesting on the wires? If you dig the National Spelling Bee and Philadelphia's interesting. How soon do you want to go to school? Five minutes. I wanna pick up the dupes. Lady wants to see you about something. Make it seven minutes. I'll see lady first, now. Lady Wilson's still kicking around in the business? That's right. And I wouldn't trade her for any dozen re-write men half her age. You know, Fred you used to be a better than fairer newspaper man. What happened that you ended up peddling flesh? What happened? I made at least five times as much money as any man on this newspaper last year. That's what happened. Oh, the man sold out for a pot of gold. Oh, it wasn't so much of that. They threw in some green stamps too. Sam, what about my client? Well, you just leave her picture there on my desk. And if she's half what you say, and if you haven't been busy with your retouching talents again I may, repeat, maybe able to use it. But I'm not promising when. Sam, I've even forgotten that you can retouch pictures. And besides, this girl is more than just a client to me. She may turn out to be something really special in my life. You're a real pal, buddy. Don't build your life on it pal, buddy. - What about city side? - Well, it's bleak. Little three year old girl disappeared couple of hours ago. Just on a hunch, I sent Hobart up. Look, Sam. I don't know why you're so down on him. - He's a good man. - He was a good man. Lately, he's been trying to make like Tennessee Williams. You give him two bit domestic quarrel he tries to build it into a three act play. Tonight, we could use it. Mr. Gatlin, there's Mr. and Mrs. Bentley Jason want to see you. They do. Well, who are they? Well, they said, Mr. Northcliff made arrangements with you for them to be shown through the paper. - I forgot. Where are they? - Right over there, sir. I'll be right with you, Jim. You come along with me. Now, tonight, you are the top expert in newspaper business. And you do know whose friends they happen to be. I know. Mr. North cliff owns this whole chain of salt mines. Don't worry. I'll turn on every bit of charm I got, Mr. Gatlin. And believe me that's enough for a bus load of over-eager college boys. Let's go, Tony Curtis. If you wanna wait in my office, I'll be right with you. Thanks, Sam. I only need a minute. Take two, they're small. Mr. Jason, I'm Sam Gatlin. Tom Northcliff, called me about you. How do you do, Mr. Gatlin? This is Mrs. Jason. Mrs. Jason. I'll bet we are nothing but a lot of irritation, Mr. Gatlin. Don't give it another thought. Unfortunately, my job doesn't leave me whole lot of time. Luckily, we have here, a young man whose gonna show you as much as you wanna see. He just assured me he has as much charm as a car load of Latin lovers. Now, I wouldn't go so far as to say that. I'll probably run into you during the evening. In case I don't, be sure to stop by office before you go. - Mr. Jason. - Thank you, Mr. Gatlin. Mrs. Jason. See you. [upbeat music] Now, my name is Carl Thomson. And please, don't hesitate to ask me any questions about anything you don't understand. You see, getting out a daily newspaper is a complex and rather battling process to anyone not on the inside. I can well imagine, Mr. Thomson. - Carl, Mrs. Jason. - Thank you, Carl. Now if you'll just follow me, we'll start at the beginning and drive right on through to the end. If it's a raise you wanna talk about we got a new directive against those, just two weeks ago, lady. As I remember, we got a new directive against those way back in 1917. No, Sam. It was almost 40 years ago, I made my fatal decision. Whether to try to lead a life of relative comfort or whether to stick to newspaper work. What's your problem then? You know, the speed run that the Air Force is making with their new bombers from Honolulu to New York. Yeah. But those guys are breaking records everyday now. A flight like this has about as much news value as a milk run. Routine stuff, lady. Yes. To you and the paper maybe. The pilot of one of those planes just happens to be my grandson. Tony? The last I heard of him, he was having trouble passing finger painting in kindergarten. Yeah. He finally bowed down or cheated or something because he's been a lieutenant in the Air Force for quite a while now. In fact, the prolific little brat is just about to make me a great grandmother. Well, lady, somebody said it, time does fly. And I'm just the kid who can prove it. [laughs] What I was hoping was that the associated press could give us 95 service on the progress of the flight. Get me Thompson at AP. It's a personal favor, I'm afraid, Sam. Hello, Mel. Sam Gatlin. Mel, shoot us a blow by blow on every thing you get on that Air Force run from Honolulu, will you? 95 service. Why, no dear, nothing special. It turns out that lady's grandson is one of the dotless fly boys. Yeah. Thanks, Mel. You see. All it amounts to, is knowing the right people. Thanks a lot, Sam. And you were actually considering a life of comfort. And all the time, you had the power of the press behind you. The power of the press? Have you ever figured out what that actually means, Sam? No. But it's a phrase that has a nice ring to it. 'Don't you think?' Alright, Jim, let's have school and get it over with. [thunder] Alright then, the sports lead is critty patrol of fight tonight. Oh, boy, here's one fight. Whoever win's it'll be an upset. - Do we want any art on this? - Yeah. Newest picture of the century would be if we could get a shot of either of 'em showing up for the fight. Maybe, we should dope one of the boys. They both been doped so often, they'd never notice difference. What have we got for the gals? Well, there's a half page ad in the women's section for a heaven sent brassieres. I said, for the gals. Since when do you work on the advertizing? You read the part of paper you like and I read the part I like. Sam, there's the Carlson Halstead wedding. Who are Carlson and Halstead? And why do they want to get married? No, they don't, actually. But the groom's father owns Palm Springs. The brides father owns national chain of shooting galleries. Have we gotten those AP wire photos on the hooping cranes? They're coming in just as I left to come here, Mr. Gatlin. Sam, we're not gonna plug those skinny birds again, are we? Do you know how many letters we got on the last story we ran on them? Or do you have any idea how few hooping cranes are left anywhere in the world? No. But I do know that not one of them buys a paper. I'm with Jim on this one. Why can't they just go to Capistrano? Like any other well-adjusted normal American bird? Pick me a good shot. We'll run it. Gee, I sure hope we didn't beat the Times to the street with that one. That should take care of the Jerry Lewis department tonight. We're pretty well set up then? Yeah, we're cooking with a solid propellant, boss. Except, that we haven't got one single thing that could be read in as news. Carlson and Halstead aren't news? I hope that all their kids are such much lushes that the little league won't have them. They got a line on that missing three year old girl. She crawled into an open catch basement, they think she's wandering around down in the storm drain someplace. Police are there and even woke up two companies of firemen. Is she alive? They won't know until they find her. [dramatic music] - Is Hobart on top of it? - He called it in. Good. Maybe we'll have something to put on the front of our paper after all. Get Harry and Simpson out there. Have each of them take photos and detailed story. Do we use that Russian theme on the lion story, Sam? Yeah, for now. But we still got time. [music continues] Mr. Bathgate. Walter Ashton said to tell you that the police beat just called. They caught the strangler of those three Hollywood girls. Well, what are you waiting for, a bonus? No, sir. It's just that I, well, used to know one of those girls who got strangled. I'm interested, that's all. What do you mean, sort of know her? I had a couple of dates with her. Not that anyone could throw rocks at me, Mr. Gatlin. What a shame, kid. You might have gotten that bonus after all. But of course, there are dates, then there are dates. I bet everything that happened was strictly her idea. My family has very strong views on these things. That sounds more like the chivalrous boy that we've all come to know and love. You tag along with me, Gallahad and if your story's really good you may still even be working here tomorrow night. [phone ringing] Gatlin. No, Mrs. Burgess, I haven't had a chance to look at today's puzzle. Well, even if I had, I certainly wouldn't be able to remember off hand what 51 down is. Well, of course, there's an answer, Mrs. Burgess. All of our crossword puzzles are thoroughly pre-tested before we run them. Yes, that's true. All of the people working here on the paper do get to see the solution of the puzzle a day before you do. But we're honorable people down here. We try hard not to peek. Well, your sister-in-law is wrong, Mrs. Burgess. We run these puzzles to make friends not enemies. No, no. I do not know what 51 down is. And I'm not being suspiciously evasive. I'm sorry, Mrs. Burgess. I can't help you. Well, well. Old Fred did have something after all. About these crane pictures, Mr. Gatlin. Cranes? - The hooping cranes. - Oh. Oh, those cranes. Yeah, well, you can see for yourself, Hymie. 'One hooping crane' 'generally looks pretty much like another hooping crane.' Which unfortunately, doesn't sell very many newspapers. Yes, sir. So, what say, we use this little piece of modern art instead? Oh, I wonder how a girl gets to be that way? And, you know, I predict that women the world over are either gonna hate that kid or end up worshipping at her shrine. Oh, they'll hate her. Oh, hi, Mrs. Gatlin. We don't get to see you down her often. - Hello. - Help you? Thank you. Well, three years of marriage is toughening. Even if a woman's place isn't necessarily at home at all times it's never in her husband's office during business hours. Except, in case of fire or flood, of course. Oh, we got the flood, now where's the fire? All I can tell you at this point is I think it's going to start with an explosion. Right in there. So, that's what you do for a living. You know, you look a whole lot like a girl I left at my house just a little while ago. Isn't that rather dangerous? I mean, leaving girls around where your wife might find them. That's why I married a girl from Philadelphia. You see.. ...they can't tell a cheating husband from a Buddhist monk. So...what are you doing later on, honey? Well...honey, to tell you the truth I haven't made any plans. Now, all of a sudden, you're giving me ideas. [ambient music] Hi. How are things on the home front? Umm. You just left this afternoon. Oh, really? Already, it seems like days or even weeks. You try to tell a child bride how much you miss her and what do you get back for your trouble? Scorn and disbelief. I think we can use little more light in here. And maybe, even a genuine certified chair for you. Oh, no, Sam. I'll only be a minute, I.. I know I've broken a cardinal rule of yours by coming to the office during working hours. I know several sayings that cover this situation beautifully like.. ..."Rules remain to be broken," or maybe, "You and I.. ...we're above man made rules." I'm going over there and get him now, Sam. I wish you wouldn't, Peg. In fact, I'd like to call the whole thing off. Right now. Call it off? How would we do that? I know every argument you're gonna give. But what a heel I must seem to be to you right now-- But you haven't even seen him. It wouldn't change anything. Believe me, it wouldn't. No, I won't believe you, Sam. Not this time, because you're wrong. An adopted child wouldn't be ours, Peg. He could be ours if we let him be. And I know he wants to be ours, 'Sam, he wants to belong to someone' 'more than anything else in the world.' I should have picked him up about noon, I.. Well, he's been dressed and packed ready to go since then. But I-I wanted to tell you.. ...first. And then, I was afraid. It just wouldn't work, Peg. 'Why?' A kid, any kid deserves people who really love and want him. And the best acting job in the world isn't gonna fool him into believing he has this if he hasn't. Well, I know one thing. I will not leave a little boy who's sitting in a front hall waiting for someone.. I'll not leave him sitting there waiting for someone who never shows up. Oh, don't, honey, please. Now, please, I-- I'm going to go get him, Sam. I wish you wouldn't. It's a mistake for everyone concerned. I'm still going to do it. [phone buzzing] Rewrite, Ashton. Who? Yeah. Oh, well, I think you want the puzzle editor. Yes, I have his number right here. It's Connor-3672. Yes, that's in Honolulu. He mails the puzzles in from there. Feels it safer that way. You're welcome, Mrs. Burgess. [thunder] In case you're thinking there's jumping you're not alone, Mr. Galtin. Hello, Jan. Sit down. And, Jan, no matter what you've been told there are times when suicide may be the only honorable way out. What's on your mind? Well, Mr. Gatlin, I've been on the paper about a year now. Give or take a days, of course. And I guess it's no secret how I got shoved into this job. All that I'm referred to is the sacred cow around here. Well, there are times when nothing else has worked that knowing the right people can do the job. There are times when knowing the right people can be murder. Besides, it was my father who knew the right people. - Oh. - But so what? Does that mean I couldn't have made it in this business on my own? If there's one thing we've got plenty of in our family, it's money. And instead of this I could've used a little of it and wasted away my life on a French Riviera. From all I've heard, it's not too bad a place to waste away. But what if I think I were cut out for the newspaper business? I mean, really. Is it such a crime that I came from a nice family? Or that I went to a good school? Where, I might add, I worked hard and did pretty darn well. Lots of people work hard, honey. In fact almost everybody I know. Okay, supposing we put it this way. What if I happen to be a really good newspaper woman in spite of the way I got the job? In that case, you'd be the exception to the rule. And how do you know I'm not just that if the paper won't even give me a chance? You're assigned to Jim Bathgate. He runs his department, hands out his own assignments. When Jim gets ready to stick out his neck to give somebody new a chance it's always because he thinks they're ready and that they've earned that chance. Well, dandy, Mr. Gatlin. Except that in a thousand years Mr. Bathgate isn't going to forgive me for coming from a good family, for having graduated from Smith College, for having enough money to buy my own stockings or for having a father who happen to know some people who could give me some help. You know, Jan, you may just be what they call a reverse snob. And I just may be a well of a good newspaper woman which couldn't matter less if I spend the rest of my life out there writing shorts and obits. What do you want, Jan? Just a chance. Maybe I'm a lousy reporter although, I bet you about anything, I'm not. Okay. So I shot off my big mouth and got myself fired. At least, I went down swinging which is the way we do things in my family. Fired? All of a sudden, you couldn't get fired around here if you turned out to be a spy for the Mirror News. After all, Thomas Carter Northcliff who started this whole chain of papers didn't exactly begin his life as a pauper. Alright, precious, you've won your point. Why haven't you blown off about this a long time ago? - I would have. - Well, because I.. Am I really gonna get a chance? Unless you insist on making obits your life's work. Gee, after all my big mouth talk.. What happens if I can't handle a story? Well, In that case, sweetheart, you get your pretty little hide tacked up right in the lobby of the men's room. Come on, relax. You'll get all the help you need from here on in. We've all been through the shakes of our first big assignment. Thanks, Mr. Gatlin. You don't suppose Mr. Bathgate's going to be mad because I went over his head? Oh, you're not going over his head. Jim. All of a sudden, I'm scared stiff. I know the feeling, Jan, almost as I'd invented it myself. Yeah. How about sending Jan over to get the woman's angle on that strangler they just picked up? Fine, sounds like a good angle. Now, who we got here to write obits? How about Collins, the one who was a sergeant in Korea. Who won all those medals. He seems to have initiative. He's got initiative and he's got character too. And it's an unbeatable combination. Recommend him unless you can think of somebody better. Better than Collins? Why that boy and I have been real buddies since he joined our little night time family. And you had better rustle your bustle now. there's a photographer ready to leave for the county jail. You miss a ride with him and you're gonna go on foot. Yes, sir. You know, I thought for a long time that girl sort of belonged around here. Well, you know me Jim. I can spot real newspaper talent through ten feet of reinforced concrete. Of course. That's why where ever good newspaper men get together your name is legend. [knocking on the door] May I come in, Mr. Gatlin? Are all our copy boys on the good old Ben everybody just having trouble sleeping tonight. I'm not supposed to speak to you for a week, remember? I remember alright, Collins. And you wouldn't be except and probable as it sounds. You may get a chance, at reporting. Oh, 95 from A.P sir. About the bunch of air force bombers from Honolulu. What is it Collins? Are you trying to prove that you can read or that I can't. No sir, am I really a reporter sir or is Mr. Bathgate still turning a knife in me. In an organization this size, how could I possibly know everything that goes on, Collins. Yes sir, sorry sir. - Collins. - Yes, sir. Congratulations. Yes, sir. Anything you say ,sir. Well, I've narrowed down the area where the kid could be. Which I suppose you could call progress, but.. I haven't found her yet. What about pictures? There's a car on the way in now with the first batch. Oh, Ben, see that lady gets these first from now on. Okay, anything else? Yeah, don't ever have any children, Ben. Ha-ha. That is like advising a guy on relief not to go to Monte Carlo for this season. Now, this is our art department. And this is Mr. Chapman. One of our staff artists. Mr. Chapman. Mr. and Mrs. Jason. - How do you do, Mr. Chapman? - How are you? Would you draw something for us please, Mr. Chapman? Draw. Draw? What would you like? A dog, a cat? Or a pig with a squiggly tail? Or how about a house? I was always real big in the house department. Especially on those chimneys with the smoke cork screwing out. Now look here. Mr. and Mrs. Jason just happen to be two of the best friends Mr. Northcliff has. And besides Mr. Gatlin himself ordered and arranged for this tour. Oh, I am sorry. I hope you won't think any the less of our newspaper chain 'because of the way I've acted.' Now what would you like me to draw? A Dog, a Cat, a Pig with a squiggly tail? How about a house with the smoke cork screwing 'out of the chimney.' Now I don't know why or who he was trying to impress. But to call me a staff artist. [laughing] I haven't had a pencil or a brush in my hand since I graduated from the art institute. No, my pitiful little job in this group effort is to re-touch things. I take the moustaches of international beauties and raise the their dresses to an acceptable level. A real man would blow up the whole joint. Yeah, well, we have to be getting on now. You know how these temperamental artists are, nuts! (male #1) Say, that's good. Simplicity, clarity, primitive and childish. That's exactly the style I'm looking for. Now. This is the chart of the storm drain system we have around here. And this, is approximately the area where that girl could be. Yeah. I want you to draw me a chart of the drains in just this one area. And I want you to use that same simple childish easily understandable technique, that has caused you to be ignored by art critics the world over. They did have a course in storm drains at the art institute didn't they? - Oh, they stressed it. - That's the way to talk. I knew you belonged on this paper the moment I spotted your extremely, low forehead. What's the latest on Tony? Just reported over Albuquerque and they're well ahead of the old records. What else? [music playing on radio] You wanted hourly reports on the movie actress? Yeah, yeah what's happened to the poor kid? Nothing, she had cream tuna fish for supper and her boyfriend came over and gave her a pedicure. A pedicure is the same as a manicure sir. I know that. What about her baby? Her baby. Well, my guess would be that everything is still status quo and it hasn't gone out to a drive in. - Or anything like that. - I'll kill you. I'm only telling what I was told. We sent you over to the jail with Jane to help with the Hollywood strangler story. We just returned, she's running it right now. Well how do you think she did? All in all I'd say not bad. The guy really went for her. But what within being in a cell and handcuffed the whole time they were together. But, there were cops all over the place. Yeah, okay. Thanks kid. I don't know weather I'm glad or sorry that I'm not gonna be around when those boys take over this business that I've known and loved so well. Right, right. That story on the little girl is catching fire. What's happened? Everything is good for us and lousy for the kid. Every television station in town already has mobile units out there, all on the way. Why didn't we all get together to help stamp out TV while there was still time. Sam, remember the Russian crisis we were gonna use? - Our line story? - Yeah. Well, here's a story coming in that makes our Russian crisis look like an Easter rule. As soon as you get it all bring it into my office. Ben, I want everything you got on that kid story. Here's the spot where she fell in. Here's the closest street intersection, 63rd and western. We got any art on her or the family? Nobody can near the family, they've barricaded themselves in their house and they wont talk to anyone. We hustled one of the neighbors for a picture she had of the kids. Alright, now fill me in. How'd she get in there? She was out with a neighbor kid playing with a puppy. Evidently, Dory was chasing the pup. 'The pup ran into that catch basin, the kid went after it'. Well, the other kid panicked, ran home, was afraid to tell anyone for nearly two hours. Then the fire department and the bureau of public works were called. 'They found Dory's eye glasses on the floor of the drain' where she crawled in, but no Dory, and no puppy. 'Obviously she got lost, and started walking' 'looking for a way out.' So for two hours it was kept a big secret by Dory's playmate. 'Then they finally started looking three hours ago.' And still nothing. What's the barrier? Look, there are half a dozen cut in channels she could have wandered into, figuring she could walk a mile or two in an hour and that five hours have gone by already. She could be anywhere in that area. 'An every hour that passes, you can widen that circle.' Plus the fact that this rain hasn't let up all day and the water levels are getting higher and higher and.. How is it that this catch basin didn't have a grading on it? Probably one of the old one's, Sam. Get some more help out there. Send another photographer. Thompson and Garable. And to hell with that dull series of theirs on smog and its effects on juvenile delinquency. And then send Jan in here, right away. - Jan? - The young pretty one. Out there, who's built like a girl. Even though your descriptions are a little vague I'll try and track her down. How big do you wanna play this? All the same as the world series, only bigger. Jim, this shot of the catch basin let's run it same size.. '...across pages two and three.' 'Across both pages 16 columns?' - That's right. - No can do. Or, can do. We'll run two eight column cuts with the gutter down the middle. Now run a type overlay, white on black across both pages use 72 point but only catch. "DANGER KIDS, STAY OUT OF THESE" Exclaimer. Then in lower case, "One little girl didn't." And read what happened below. Yeah. What those parents must be going through, Jim. At least, with me it was all over before they told me. The boys down in the composing room are gonna start gunning for another Abraham Lincoln to free them after this job. [dramatic music] I don't believe it. What are your Russian's up to now? They agreed with us three times in the United Nations. - Why? - Who cares, don't you get it.. They agreed with us three times. Well, there's only one answer. - What? - Today we were wrong. Well, Lady Aster, how did you like your first job? They say some girls find guys like that irresistible. I'll sleep better tonight knowing that boy's in the cage. Sounds like the kinda guy my present wife goes for. Jan, I have gone over your story.. I mean, on the side of course. I have gone over your story, you're gonna lose a paragraph. I am sorry, I tried to keep the adjectives down. Debbie Reynolds, on this newspaper when you only lose one paragraph, that's like getting a bronze star. You came up with a good angle and you seem to know your way around a typewriter. You asked for a chance and you picked this night. Bathgate's got another task you're gotta cut more of your teeth on. He'll brief you on the whole thing tell you what he wants. Well, goodbye dear. Goodbye, I mean, I am practically there, sir. [intense music] * Boy * * Copy boy * * A job's that headed no where on a one way track * * Rush this copy over there then bring it back * * Boy copy boy * * Just running all the errands like without a rest * * Want to be a copy boy well be my guest * * Boy copy..* Boy. Well, you sure fooled me. Never in a million years would I have thought of looking in the society section. And you, put those kettle drums away. Jake, how are things in 'Radio and TV' land tonight? I don't know, I haven't been home all day. I'll ask my kid. When you do ask him if Huckleberry Hound is really a Dog, will you? [orchestra music] How are the Dodger's doing, Vince? Not bad, considering we're right in the middle of the football season. Oh, that's right, they do have different times of the year when they play those various games, don't they? Except in February, which has only 28 of course. Sam, do you ever get the feeling you're spending your entire life writing millions and millions of words that nobody ever reads. Oh, that's treason you're talking, pal. What would people line their garbage cans with if we didn't keep our noses to the grinding stone. Good evening, Mr. Pettifog, anything hot on the revival circuit tonight? I'm the real estate editor tonight, Mr. Gatlin. Oh, sorry. On the nights that I'm the religious editor I sit there. Mr. Gatlin, this job of mine doesn't make any sense at all. What do you mean? Well, in the first place, I don't know anything but anything about religion. And if you put what I don't know about religion alongside what I don't know about real estate, well, it adds up to enough total ignorance to create an absolute vacuum. Well now, what would you like to be doing, Mr. Pettifog? Weather. - You'd like to do the weather? - Oh yes, sir. Why I'll bet I have known cumulonimbus cloud from a cirrus since I was four years old. - And that's good? - It's just an indication. Alright, Mr. Pettifog, as of now you are our weather editor and furthermore you are going to get to be editor of this department without having to give up your job either as religious editor or real estate editor. Now, what do you think of that, Mr. Pettifog? I wonder if we're gonna be able to get another desk in here. Oh, we'll get another desk in here even if it means moving you out. Mr. Gatlin. I wondered if it'd be alright if we had the sign on the door changed. But what would you like it to read? Editor of Heaven and Earth. Oh great, Sam, I'm glad I caught you out, just take a minute. May I present Miss Lucile Greghouser last year's official Miss Reentry Nosecorn. I'll bet she was, how do you do, Miss Greghouser? Naturally, we'll bury all this Lucile Greghouser stuff and get a name that really fits her. This is a real sensitive girl, Sam. Yeah well, thanks for dropping by Fred. Wait, you owe me a minute. After all, there were some pretty damaging remarks made earlier around here about my re-touching pictures. And you can't do that to this overly sensitive kid. So? Lucille. Now, darling. Sensitive. And that Sam, you cannot say is retouched. I don't even care. 'Then you'll run her picture?' 'Fred, I don't think the public is ready for her yet.' Now, look Sam, we used to work together, we used to drink together, we've been friends for years, right. On the strength of that I'm telling you if you'll just run her picture I think it might do it for me with this kid. Well, nature boy if you think I am gonna ask do what you're crazy. [instrumental music] Lucille, would you mind buttoning up? 'We have a paper to get out here, you see.' - Are you gonna run it, Sam? - I was Fred. In fact I think it's already plated. But when you want me to be a party to one of your sordid conquest of some innocent child. How could I possibly justify it to myself later? Are you gonna run it? I honestly do not know Fred, this is one of those decisions that calls for a great deal of thought. What'd I tell you kid, it's all set. What are the chances of the rain letting up. Ben, remind me to write up a recommendation for a $10 - raise for Pettyfog, will you? - Pettyfog? That guy is holding down more departments on this paper than I knew we had. When? Tomorrow morning? Well, that's not gonna do that little girl any good. Well, who said it was your fault. All I know is that once a bushfire gets going good you boys can't come up with a cup full of moist air. But just a little three year old girl fall into a storm drain and bingo a cloudburst. Well, you too Charlie. No let up until tomorrow, huh? At least that's what Kruger over at the weather bureau says and he's usually right. That crape hanger. [phone ringing] City Desk, Bathgate. You did huh? Well, look at you. Alright, dictate and come out and print the story. Lady, make this insert high in your lead. That was your protege, Jan. Somehow she managed to get through to little Dori's parents and got the only interview they've given out so far. Turns out to be good, why don't you give her a byline? - On her first night? - What difference does it make? If she got a drop on everybody else she deserves it. She'll ask for a raise, Sam. So would I, pal, and I'd get it. You're liable to fix it so that kid get's the resentment of everyone on the paper. Jim, the only squawk I'll ever take is when somebody else comes up with something just as good but doesn't get treated just as well. What's the condition of the storm drains? Spilling over and flooding out in the valley. The search crews are still working in the kid's district. But not for long, according to Hobert's last report. Just in case anybody thinks it isn't really raining these are latest and maybe the last. [dramatic music] 'That's a rookie fireman by the name of Johnson.' 'It was his first day on the job and he got' 'trapped in one of the drains.' Use it and caption it, a rookie counts his take home pay. Mrs. Gatlin's on the phone, sir. I'll take it in my office, thanks. They've taken that movie star down to the delivery room. That's a little better, now we're getting somewhere. Oh, maybe so, sir. But babies, I just don't dig all those frantic commotion people are always making over them, a baby is a baby, big deal. (male #2) 'That is all I have to show for two years of devoted' 'service to this pamphlet.' Hey, that's a good looking pipe. Ashton bought it and then threw it away when he found out it choked him. I scrounged it out of a waste basket. - It's a real beauty. - Yeah, it's great. - Except it chokes me too. - You moving or something? I'm quitting. Why not? Bathgate's been on my back ever since I started and it's only gonna get worse before it gets unbearable. I don't blame you, you take it and you're taking it for what. You have The Examiner. What is it?A newspaper that's all. It's not like we joined the priesthood. Ever seen these things on a news stand on a day like this? Look like old bags there with their faces fallen. That right, Aristotle and that's because nobody's come up with a waterproof paper yet. And even if they did we wouldn't use it. The Los Angeles Examiner wouldn't use it and neither would any other paper in the country because we have to print on the cheapest paper they can make otherwise we cant sell for a dime. Do you know what people use these for? They roll them up and they swat their puppies for wetting on the rug, they spread them on the floor when they are painting the walls they wrap fish in them, they shred them up and pack their two bed china in them when they move or else they pile up in the garage until they're declared a fire hazard, but, this.. ..also happens to be a couple of more things. It's got print on it, that tells stories that hundreds of good men all over the world have broken their backs to get. 'Gives a lot of information to a lot of people' 'who wouldn't have known about these things if we hadn't' 'taken the trouble to tell them.' 'It's the sum total of the work of a lot of guys' 'who don't quit.' Yeah, It's a newspaper, that's all. Well for once you're right, stupid. That only cost's ten cents, that's all. But if you only read the comics section or the ads it's still the best buy for your money in the world. I am sorry to see you go, Collins. Here. You'd probably want something to read on the way home. I'm not leaving the paper, Mr. Bathgate. Yeah? Well, I wouldn't send your laundry out kid. But I told you how I felt about that pig and just because you have him across the street doesn't change anything. No, not even for a minute. I wish you'd go home because this storm isn't gonna let up and the valley is already flooded. Wait for me? Honey, I don't know what time we're gonna finish. Yes, I am sorry too, honey. Alright, goodbye. 'Pictures coming over now' 'were taken at Hickam Field, Honolulu.' 'Right before the start of that Air Force speed run.' They're individual shots of the boys and the planes that they are flying. I'm not to get too technical because I couldn't anyway. Let's say we're in Honolulu. Now the original photos of these fliers look like this. This photo was then placed on a metal cylinder that was whirling at a high speed and was transmitted electronically, to this machine right here. I noticed that all the pictures are of the same size. Eight by ten. 'You see, I took a little journalism in college and..' How deep would they run on a three column? You may like to see how we do that. First, we crop them. And now that's the picture. It'll be three columns wide - That's...six inches-- - You see Mrs. Jason. Three columns is six inches. We sight down the photo like this using our crop marks. 'Then being very careful..' ..very careful, we spin the photo with a steady hand.. steady.. And there, our picture is five inches deep. 'But you got to have a steady hand.' Uh. Thank you, Carl. Thank you, Mr. Shiperham. - Well, shall we move on? - Anything you say, Carl. - 'Thank you, Mr. Shiperham.' - Not at all. Eh, Carl? - My ruler? - Oh, yes. Sorry. Carl? Yes, Mr. Shiperham? I'll, uh, be wanting to see you a minute before.. - ...you check out tonight. - See me? Well, sure. Anything you say. I'll be glad to. Anything you say, Mr. Shiperham. 'There's a beautiful red girl here to see you, boss.' Oh, it's you. What did you do? Swim back under water? It's about the only way you're going to get anywhere tonight. How is it out there, Jane? Like a whole bunch of search flights and confusion right in the middle of an ocean of mud. Is there any hope for the child? I don't see how. Only who am I to write her off. There's a whole bunch of the nicest guys I've ever met who are working their hearts out. They won't stop looking for her until they drag them out of there forcibly. You better write up your interview with the parents. - Sam, she's soaking! - Sorry, lady. We're running out of time. It's alright. I already wrote it up while I was waiting. It's in long hand, but it'll take me a minute to type. I can read long-hand. Boy? Give this to Jerry and Linhopp down at the composing room and wait for a proof. I want this back within five minutes from now. I said five minutes. - Yes, sir. - What's that film? Some pictures I took of Dory's parents while I was interviewing them. - Pictures? - Stan Gorman had an extra roll. - So I borrowed it from him. - Do you think you got anything? Sure. I've been fooling around with cameras since I was 14. I even have my own dark room and enlarger at home. Well, name me one cute young girl who doesn't. Boy. Run these through the photo lab. Wait there until they process it. Bring them back to me in 30 seconds. - What-- - I said 20 seconds. Yes, sir. Get out of those wet clothes. And change into what? Come on, honey. I have some things in my locker. You can wear them, till yours dry. I hate to send a young kid up in an old outfit like that. [thunder rumbling] - Anything the matter, Sam? - Yeah. Lots of things that matter. Things like a little girl about as big as a yardstick, lost in a cold black tunnel with a million gallons of water all trying to kill her. Wasn't it you who said to me that if you let yourself get too personally involved in your stories, you'll end up with nothing but lot of deep hurts and no job? Yeah, probably. It sounds like the kind of thing I'd say and.. But if they don't find that kid.. And find her alive.. But, you don't care a whole lot about kids, do you, Jim? When they're in trouble, I do. That when one of 'em isn't given a break then someone could very easily kill 'em. And I care a whole hell of a lot, Sam. [operatic music] What's the matter? [dramatic music] Now I suppose it's confirmed. I talked to Milt at the A.P. And I called an old friend of mine at the Newark Airport. Toni's plane exploded in the air about 10 minutes before landing. Not one of the crew had a chance of getting out. [dramatic music] Sam. You wanna go out and get real drunk after we wrap it up tonight? Ten years ago, that might've helped, Ben. In fact, it did. But these days.. All I seem to do is to work up a great big headache to punish myself for hurting someplace else. Well, thanks. Getting a little gassed up on occasions is the only vice I've got left. Now you've gone and loused that up for me. [telephone ringing] Gatlin. Yeah, Hobert? They did. Dead, huh? They found the little girl's dog washed out at the Manchester spillway. Well, then she must be in that same system. What do you mean they're gonna give up? How soon? Hobert, who's running that mess out there? 'Bronson? Bureau of Public Works?' 'Fine. Now you tell Fred Bronson for me that' 'if he calls it off' I'll start going after him on every page of this newspaper and that includes the ads and the comic sections. I don't care what they think. You keep them going. Threaten them with anything. Impeachment, recall. 'Tell them we demand a recount. Tell them we'll' 'print everything we know about them and that little blonde' 'secretary, but keep them going.' What do you mean "What little blonde secretary?" There's always a little blonde secretary in everybody's closet. Where are you parked? I want you to keep this transmission hot from now until the finish. 'Well, if they make you move, drive with one hand and keep' 'the radio phone in the other.' Your battery won't go dead if you turn on your ignition and keep your motor running. I know how much gasoline costs, Hobert. Looks like we're coming to the bitter end. Let's keep someone on both ends all the time. You'll fix? - I'll fix. - Alright, Hobert. You stay there until you get somebody to take over from you. Then you dig up Fred Bronson and you tell him exactly what I told you. Well, it couldn't have happened to a nicer girl. When are you gonna tell her? Well, I guess there'll never be a better time than right now. Or a worse one for that matter. Are you still there, Hobert? Well, you better be. Hobert, I'm gonna keep you on hold for a minute. Boy. Honey, now listen hard and don't pull any wrong plugs for once. Or you'll be back at your old job as prison guard. Of course this is Mr. Bathgate. We got Hobert on a radio line three, patch it back to the city desk until I get somebody there to handle it. Collins, take over the ascent. - But sir, I was told to-- - I'm telling you not to. And now, move. Colbert? This is Jim Bathgate. Did you hear about ladies grandson crashing in just ten minutes before he was to land? Yeah I'll let.. Is that you Collins? No you're not interrupting and you're not on the wrong line. You're supposed to be on this line and you stay on it. Yeah, yeah. I'll see to it. Why don't you go on home, lady? What would I do at home, Sam? It was just something to say because I couldn't think of the right thing. Are they positive it was Toni's plane? It was Toni's plane. [dramatic music] I think this time it hurts too much, Sam. Here I am, a thousand years old. Everybody I've ever really loved nearly all the friends I started out with in this business.. Gone. And here I am, big as life. Still walking around. Why, Sam? Tell me one good reason why. You give me all the easy ones. Don't you? I've never been accused of being particularly religious. I don't even know if I can qualify for any other recognized faith. But anyone who thinks I don't believe in something.. ...either doesn't know me at all or they've never had anything hit them hard enough to start them thinking about these things. What do you believe in, Sam? Well, I believe there's a reason for things happening the way they do. I don't know what it is. But I do believe that there is a reason. Which I know wouldn't be considered advanced thinking 'even for a seven year old kid who only goes' 'to Sunday school occasionally.' But for me, it's a great big, giant step, lady. What about this power who's supposed to be greater than we are? Do you believe in Him, Sam? Oh, there has to be something or someone bigger than we are, lady. Why, you take this microscopic fragment of the universe we live on. In a billion years, we couldn't have conceived how it started to going or kept it going for two seconds. Besides, what would be so tough about being a power that's greater than we are? In all the years that we've known each other, Sam. The only other time we've ever said three consecutive serious words to each other.. ...was the night your wife and son were killed. 'Then I was the one who was trying to think of just the right words to say.' I got mine for a speed record. And you got yours so that some drunk could have one more for the road. [orchestra music] But, bad as it was, you got one break, I didn't. What? You're still young enough to start another family. Maybe you didn't know it, lady. Peggy can't have children. Of course I knew. That wasn't what I was thinking of. You mean that adoption business? How did you know about that? Because you put my name down on your application as one of your character references. Oh, yeah. But all that was over two years ago, now. And in the mean time-- They even came to see me a couple of times. Would you like to know what I told them? It isn't important now. No? They seem to think it was. I said I just happen to know what a wonderful father you are. 'And that any child would be getting the biggest break of his life if you and Peggy took him in.' Because actually, you needed a child. Even more than he needed you. - You could be wrong, you know? - 'I have been wrong.' So many times, I quit keeping score. But not about a thing like this, Sam. But Toni was really yours, lady. And that's what makes all the difference. All what difference? The only difference is that you bring him home from an orphanage instead of a hospital. 'And you don't know anymore about the one from the hospital' 'than you do about the one from the orphanage.' It's what you do with them from then on.. ...that decides everything, Sam. Oh, great. I thought if you had somebody to talk to you'd feel better about Toni. So what do we talk about? My problems. That's just the kind of therapy you pay $25 an hour for. [sobbing] Hey, how would you like to use my office for a little while? I'll be alright, Sam. You've forgotten. We're not heroes in this business. We just write about the heroes. Don't pamper me, Sam. I need to keep right on working. Besides, everything's about ready to break. We've done it without you before. When? Well.. Well, that night 12 years ago, when you got hit by a car and you showed up two hours late. Come on, lady. I'll dock your salary, if it'll make you feel any better. You know, lady.. ...she doesn't look nearly as good in your clothes as you do. She will. As soon as she gets the figure for 'em. How did she take it? Just exactly like you knew she would. - You got any art on Toni? - Wired for them. I want it on the front page. Give it a two column cut with three column head. We've the year's biggest story going and that's gonna cut a big hole in it. How do we justify it? Write it off to 40 years of faithful service and save the paper the price of a gold watch. - Well! - I'm on your side. And day after tomorrow, we can chip in and start our own weekly shopping news. [telephone ringing] City News, Bathgate. Yes, Ms. Burgess? Well, how many letters? Oh, you mean 51 down. The word is "concur." C-O-N-C-U-R. Yes, sure. No, no. 36 across is "par." You bet. You're welcome, Mrs. Burgess. [comical music] Well, Mr. Bath...gate. For once, I'm happy to say I am, I firmly believe the bearer of joyous tidings. Don't tell me you've come down with something incurable. No, sir. But I'll bet this is even better news than if I had. She had twins, sir. Who had twins? Your sister? Your mother? My wife? My wife? No, of course, not. How could she? She hasn't been outta the house in four months. No, sir. The Italian movie star. They called from the hospital. How can you be sure? You count them? We made absolutely sure, Mr. Bathgate. Don't forget, we all had money down on that. Well.. Tell me, son, what's your name? Ron, sir. Ron Danton. Well, Ron, you impress me as a young boy who is going places in this organization. So she had twins, did she? Did someone give you a tip on this baby bit tonight Mr. Bathgate? Tips are nothing but the true suckers breakfast food. It was a simple assignment, kid. I went through our back files, weeded through all of the men and narrowed down to the guy most likely to be the real father. And when I checked him out I found that twins run in his family. So with the odds at 50 to one.. At one time or another, she's gone with nearly every guy in Movieville. Which one is the guy with twins in his family? - Her husband. - Her husband? Never overlook the obvious, Ron, and don't lean on my desk. Now go get me my money and get right back. - Yes, sir. Give me the slip. - Slip? The slip they gave when you placed the bet. Collins, give this guy the receipt for that bet you made for me. Mr. Bathgate, can somebody relieve me here for a minute? No. Now let's have that slip. I desperately need relief, sir. Come on. Give me the slip. I'm on the phone, Mr. Bathgate. The slip, Collins. I didn't place your bet, Mr. Bathgate. You didn't what? I- It was such a stupid bet. And the odds were all wrong and lopsided, and I'd figured if I had saved you from your own temporary insanity, you'd be kissing me on both cheeks. Collins. Look at me. Tell me, Collins. Am I kissing you on both cheeks? - No, sir. - Am I kissing you on even one? I still say it was a sucker bet. And my loyalty to you and the organization that pays my salary just wouldn't let me stand by and watch you do something so idiotic. And to show you how honest my intentions were here, here's your dollar back. Which leaves only 49 unaccounted for. I told you, Mr. Bathgate. I didn't place the bet. Ah, you decided to book the bet yourself then, Collins. No, I-I didn't say that, sir. There is nothing lower than a bookie who welshes on a bet. And to save you that fate I'm going to take five dollars out of your salary each week for the next ten weeks. Now sign it. - No, I can't, Mr. Bathgate. - Sign it. My wife's gonna have a baby in two weeks. 12 weeks. Yes, sir, Mr. Hobert. Just a minute. Mr. Gatlin? Mr. Gatlin. [dramatic music] Gatlin. Yeah, Hobert. They found the kid. Alright, Hobert. Now take it a little slower. Jim. Give me a new lead, quick. Already on it, Sam. If that's alright with you and Jim. Glad to have you aboard, youngster. You're crazy. You know that, don't you? - I was the first one they told. - 'Alright, Hobert.' They just brought her out. Hobert's pretty sure she's dead. But they've got to resuscitate on her now. Where did they find her? About a mile and a half from where she fell in. 'What took them so long?' They figured she must've been all over the place. She got turned around and then doubled back. Who found her? If that isn't a miracle, it's close enough to be counted for one, isn't it? Alright, Hobert. Give it all to lady. Right. 'Well, they finally had to give up.' 'They ordered everybody up out of the drains.' 'It was the last three guys out playing a hunch' 'who found her wedged in between an inspection ladder' 'and the drain wall.' Cover us with plenty of side bar stuff. I want art. The shot of that ladder the guys who found her, the family, the battalion chief the spectators angle. The works. You got it? Right. I'll let you know. [melancholic music] You sure now? Everything is set but the front page. Okay. The next few minutes, wind it up one way or the other. But I promise, you boys in the composing room will be among the very first to know. After which, I'll expect to see a new record set in claiming that page and getting our paper on the streets or wherever it is they go after they leave here. Yes, cupcake. Oh, yes, we all know. If that guy's gonna buy his own paper tomorrow he made a killing. There wasn't a single bet down on twins. [comical music] Sam, I've got an idea. After we knock off-- I don't wanna get drunk. You don't? Why not? It's been my whole trouble lately, Jim. I don't wanna get drunk, I don't wanna stay sober. And pretty girls are beginning to bore me. I got tired blood, Jim. Well, I was born with tired blood. That's not bad once you get used to it. - 'Cause you feel pretty-- - Yeah, Hobart! - You got that, Lady? - Yes, Sam, yes. She's alive. [upbeat music] Hobart, tell everybody out there I think they did a fine job. Yes, Hobart. Everybody includes you too. What? Brunson wants to talk to me? Fred Brunson? Bureau Of Public Works? Well, put him on. Fred. For goodness sakes, what are you doing up at this hour? Hobart threatened you? Hobart said that I threatened you? Oh, Fred. What little blonde secretary? Fred, Fred. Do you ever take a drink in the morning? [comical music] [thunder] (Jim) 'You are all made up.' 'Now there aren't gonna be any changes from up here.' Because I know there aren't gonna be any changes. What do you want me to do? Swear an oath and sign it in triplicates? Alright, Jerry, now, why not make it official and put it in the form of a direct order? You know, say something like "Roll the presses." Here they go. Thelma, Merry, Rosanne. In exactly two minutes they'll kick them up to their high speed run. Every night, I hear those presses. Every night, I get the same feeling. Jim, in all your life have you ever really wanted to be in any other business? Yeah. Hello, Sam. Hello, honey. He is outside, Sam. Peggy, don't you think I have any right to make up my own mind about this? I think you have every right, Sam. I just think, in a situation like this you don't have any right to change your mind. When I first agreed to give this a try, Peg.. ...it was almost two years ago. And I suppose I'd been talked in to the idea that another child might help me forget the death of my own. But now I know it's hopeless. I'll never be able to forget him. Nobody ever suggested that you should, Sam. And nobody ever suggested that you should forget your first wife when you married me. But that hasn't kept us from being in love or from being happy. Has it? It isn't the same, Peg. You just don't know. Then tell me, so I will know. I simply couldn't go through it again, Peg. You don't know what it was like. Months.. Months after he'd been killed I'd suddenly stumbled across something of his. A little shoe, a ball, a report card. And it'd tear me apart all over again. Everybody thinks I'd be such a good father. I wouldn't, Peg. I'd be so scared that some thing must gonna happen to him that I'd never leave the house. So that's why you married me, Sam. Because you knew I couldn't have any children you might become attached to. Don't you ever say anything like that again, Peggy. Regardless of anything, I married you because I was in love with you. 'I'm still in love with you.' You know that, as well as I do. I know.. ...that wasn't very fair of me, Sam. What am I gonna do about the boy? 'If you'd just see him, Sam.' If I saw him... I'd fall in love with him. I know that as well as you do. But I know something else too. Tonight, there was a little girl lost in a storm drain. Peg...I'm afraid I'd have blown my brains out before I even knew either she was dead or alive. Oh.. [bell rings] [machine rumbling] (male #3) 'Is Mrs. Gatlin in here?' [mellow music] What's all that noise? Is Mrs. Gatlin here, sir? Come here to me, son. [music continues] Sir, what's that noise? Don't you know what that is? They are printing the funny papers. 'Oh, uh, Carl.' Are you ready to go, Lady? You know, I don't want to go home tonight, Jan. You're not, you are coming home with me. Thanks, honey. [comical music] Yeah. - Let's go, Ben. - Oh, thanks, Jim, I'd love one. 'Mr. Bathgate.' Mr. Bathgate. I'd been figuring it out with the pencil. And with $5 out of my salary every week well, I just won't be able to live. Well, who asked you to? [upbeat music] [music continues]
