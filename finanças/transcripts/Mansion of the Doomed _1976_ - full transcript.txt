No, I am a scientist no more nightmares I have to find my answers rationally, not emotionally. And by hell, I will. What is my quest? To know my work as deeply as possible, nothing else. An electronic visual unit. A micro-camera implanted in an artificial eye. Electronics is miniaturization in the service of science. Sure. But what am I saying, they could damage the brain. No no no no no, it's ridiculous, it's absurd. My Nancy is a healthy girl. She hasn't changed at all. In spite of everything she has been through she will always be happy, alive. Let's try again, please. Just one more tub, you're too tired - Good 1... 2... 3 Doesn't count, doesn't count, you left early - Liar. Dad, I love you. Daddy, I love you. I love you. I love you. It must be mandatory. Eyes in good condition. As soon as the death of their owner is established they are to be removed and preserved. So, what is this all about? Dr. Chaney, it is up to me to run the risk of your probable censorship. Some of the new people would like to know your opinion about Dr. Boren from Dublin. And his theory of eye transplants. He has come to claim - I know very well what he claims. And he is free to do so. As I already said, I have no intention to follow him in that way. No... no, there is a limit even for science. No... no, there is a limit even for science. For science. How could I have predicted that I would cross that terrible line. My little dog. - Honey, can you see the light? - No, I can't. Nothing. Nothing to do. I don't know what to do, Katherine. I'm at a dead end - Leon, why don't you discuss this with your colleagues? Should I wait for others to give me the solution? The theory of that Irish doctor is stuck in my mind, what's his name? - Boren? - Boren, yeah. In our case his theory is the best one, bold but interesting. It consists in transplanting a cornea from a living being to another one. He has already done it with animals. And can an animal's cornea be transplanted into a human eye? No no, no. I was thinking of something else. A living organ transplanted into a living organism. Not only the cornea, it would not be necessary in this case, to transplant the eye. The whole eye. But Nancy is blind. My daughter will see again. And I warn you that I don't like your pessimism I love it too. Sorry. After the death of her mother, without you I couldn't have brought her up. Transplant the whole eye. You could destroy her optic nerve. And what do you know? How can you know without trying? I have to try. Nancy. You haven't visited me in days, daddy. Trust me, honey, trust me. Don't blame yourself if you can't help me. You can help yourself. Get out of this... go sit on the edge of the pool, walk with Katherine. Do something. Dad. My little one, why don't you come down this evening? We can have dinner together, phone Dan and invite him. It's over. I thought you still loved her. And that's how it is. Thank you, Katherine. Darling, would you mind helping Nancy get ready for dinner? I'll go right now. Dan, do you remember the day of the accident? Of course I remember it, something terrible. I often remember that on that very day you talked about about the theory of corneal transplantation from one living being to another. And she said she didn't want to go that far. Sometimes things happen that force you to change your mind. It happened to me. We still have a few minutes before Nancy comes down. Come, I want to show you something. As you know, Boren's work involves the transplantation of the cornea alone. From one living being to another. Before you look at these animals I want to remind you of a fact. This dog had both blue eyes. This one had dark eyes. May I? I removed one eye from each of them. And transplanted it into the eye socket of the other. But it is not possible - as you can see. - How did you do it? - Not how, but why. - Why? - Because it shortens my way to give Nancy her sight back. The eyes of beasts don't work for humans. No, of course, but between humans transplantation is possible, do you agree? Cadaver corneas are easily obtained from the eye bank I'm talking about live harvesting. Hey, Dan, are you sick? What was in that whisky? You always said you loved Nancy, remember? Nancy. For love you can give up your eyes I would do it with immense pleasure, but... Give up? I cannot. But you will. My eyes. Enough. Scalpel. Clock. Clamp. Sterilize 19 minutes and 31 seconds. First enucleation. Nancy. Say something, honey. I'm trying to help you, talk. Dad. Open your eyes, my baby. Darling, don't worry about the scars, I swear they will disappear in a week. So beautiful. Hello, this is Dr. Chaney. Sure, Lieutenant. No, no, no news of Dr. Bryan for weeks now. Have you tried his mother's in New York? Yeah, I understand. I don't want us to face a misfortune. Sure, sure, every day, you do the same, let me know something. Thank you, Lieutenant. Come, come whenever you want. It's you. Do you go to the hospital so elegant? Sure, I have to make a good impression. I dreamed that you were going to Sweden for the nobel prize. Well, maybe... what are you doing today? Since Dan doesn't show up I thought I'd go see him. No, I don't think that's a great idea. In a couple of weeks those scars will disappear and you'll feel more comfortable. Now you have to go to your room and do your eye exercises. 5 minutes a day, don't forget. You can't neglect my prescriptions. Those exercises are absolutely necessary for your eyes. Okay. Yuh, Dan... Dan. Yuh - Who is it? Ah, say, dear. Sorry to bother you, have you seen Dr. Bryan today? No, I haven't seen him for a while. Why don't you come in for a coffee? No, thank you, some other time. I'll wait for you. Leon. Excuse me, Leon, but didn't the police ever ask you anything about Dan? Nobody knows anything about it, maybe he went back to his dear eastern countries. If that was the case, he would have told your daughter for sure, they are still engaged, aren't they? This is disturbing Nancy too much. Sorry but I have a class. Thank you thank you, save your hands. It's really funny, today that I finally have something something really important to tell you, less than half of the audience is present that I had the last time I was here. They don't know, poor devils, that they have lost the best part of my thinking. If you remember, a few weeks ago, we talked about living transplants. And in that occasion I contested this theory. But back home, I started to feel guilty. Those who work in the medical profession cannot close themselves off from their own ideas. And so, in the following days, I collected all the material available on the subject. I know, I have been absent for too long but I had many good reasons. I studied the process, I experimented on my own and I soon found out that Boren had gone deeper into his work but not enough. What I'm about to reveal is the result of an experiment that until today has never been successful. And as you well know there are two major problems in eye transplant operations. First, the optic nerve does not regenerate like many other parts of the body do. Second: When the surgery is performed it is necessary to avoid the blockage of the retinal circulation. Help, I can't see anymore, I'm blind again. Let's examine the main danger of damaging one of the optic nerves. The effect can also affect the other one, but be careful. If we try to remove the whole structure. Excuse me, Doctor - What is it? An urgent phone call from her house, I wouldn't have interrupted her. If the lady hadn't seemed so upset. Excuse me. It is certainly an inflammation of the deep layers. There's no other explanation, maybe the water, that dive he made. Some effort, a normal reaction, a run. It is impossible to work on new eyes, they would not pass the test. Wait, let me check the eyes first, and it's fine. Katherine. Katherine, let me out of here. I need more eyes, even imperfect ones, it doesn't matter. But I can't leave my daughter in the dark. The biggest problem is always the rejection, but I will overcome this barrier. I will not make any mistake. Hi. How far do you go? I'm just going for a little ride, where do you want to go? Lordword - That's fine with me, mount up. Thanks. He must have lost some capillaries and caused a small hemorrhage. Resulting in an infection. Nothing exceptional, I just need to improve my technique. It's ready, we can prepare it Nancy, before long, will be able to see again. And this time forever. Time is against us, I found strange resistance in repeating the operation. A wall of connective tissue formed and I could not overcome it. I can't risk brain shock, it would kill all hope. This is Dr. Chaney. Doctor, Miss Danna. Good morning... Thank you - Please have a seat, Miss. Very well, according to these cards and according to my secretary. You have very good references, Miss Danna. Why are you interested in being a nurse? I really don't know, doctor, it's something that has always attracted me. Now I even have the time to do it I live around here, the salary offered is good. That's true, but I have to warn you that it's a lot of work. It's about taking care of your daughter, isn't it? Unfortunately she is blind and my job doesn't allow me to follow her as I would like to. - Are you free now? - Almost free I don't understand, the request was clear, I need a full time nurse. Well, you see, I want to be honest with you I didn't tell the agency but I am married, but my husband travels a lot. - What is his job? - He is a sheriff for the state police. State Police Sheriff. All he does is transport murderers up and down the country I stay alone for a long time and wish I had a job. Her situation seemed ideal to me. Yes, it's true, you seem to me the ideal person, Miss Danna. But I still have to see other candidates, do you understand? We will let you know. I was raised in the St. Vincent's orphanage. Does this mean you have no family? Well, does she have a husband? No, no husband. No boyfriend either, I've been in this town for two weeks now. I'm sure my daughter will like it a lot. Does that mean that job is mine? - When do you want to start? - Tomorrow? Sure, tomorrow is fine. Can I offer you something to drink? Thank you - You're welcome. I am sure I will like working here. You'll see again, my baby. Those scars break my heart but they are necessary. Better with scars than blind. Clamps, quick, we're bloody behind. It's clear that this was a weak subject. There is no other explanation for this failure. An unfortunate choice but we will not miss the donors Katherine. That bitch is not answering. - Oh my god! - Be brave. Be brave, the good time will come. I am Sylvia Porter, sorry to keep you waiting. But I was with other clients in another house and I was late. Don't worry, do you mind if I came alone? Not at all. If you allow me to describe the characteristics of the villas? From here you have a fabulous view of the city, isn't it exceptional? The inhabitants of the area all love peace and quiet. Absolute quiet is combined here with a distance of only 5 minutes from the city center. Is that one already sold or not? Yes, even if it's not finished yet. Nevertheless it is an example of the type and quality of our constructions. - Can I see it? - Of course - thank you. Nancy, can you see, my child? Can't you see anything? No... no. I don't see anything and I don't care. Yet I am sure, the operating technique is exact. After the third surgery, Nancy regained her sight for a few days. - You know what I found out? - Stop it. Now the only thing you have to try to find out is how to get rid of those people down there. I see that Dan has succeeded in moving you. We have to get rid of those wretches. And how do you think I could do that? Can you tell me? Let's hear. Kill them. Kill them? But I intend to give them back their sight and as soon as I succeed with Nancy I will do it. I need to intensify my studies, one more operation, one more. Where are they? - What happened to me? - Good good. Why is it so dark? Stay calm... stay calm. Help - It's worse, you know? We are also like you, stop. Don't shout. It's useless, sister, it's all useless. We are prisoners of two madmen who have reduced us to this condition. But why? Calm down, don't scream. There she is, that bitch. Here, try to calm her down. I really feel sorry for Sylvia, she was an efficient, healthy woman. Her eyes were perfect. She is strong, she will find a way to overcome the trauma of the mutilation. There is one essential thing in my experiment that I cannot grasp. It's as if the eyes are deciding their own self-deliverance before I do the transplant. Katherine, kill me, please! Katherine, please! Yes, darling, one more round do you want to do? Children's eyes are the mirrors of truth. It is the curious and useless prerogative of the innocent. That's what my Nancy needs. In the future maybe science will be able to cause the regeneration of eyes and other organs, without more operations, spontaneously. But for now it is necessary that someone is sacrificed for this future that concerns all of humanity. Certainly not the sick or the old. Theirs are organs of survivors who have known sadness, anguish. No... No, you need big, young, virgin eyes, full of joy. Hi - Hi. - What are you reading? - A woman called fantasy. It's weird that all the other kids are having fun playing. And you're standing here with your nose buried in the pages of a book. You know what? You look just like me when I was your age. I never got tired of reading. The other kids used to make fun of me, did that ever happen to you? Only sometimes - Good I hope that when you grow up what happened to me won't happen to you. What happened to you? Well, it's a bit embarrassing. The fact is that I'm getting old, and... I continue to enjoy many of the things I enjoyed as a child. - Example? - Example? Going to amusement parks. I go to Disneyland at least once a month I love Disneyland - Really? Well I wanted to go there for a couple of hours this afternoon but I hated to go alone. - Would you go with me? - Of course I will. Maybe it's better to stop by and tell your parents first. Maybe, but we will have to wait until 4:30, they come back from work at that time. I just happen to have an appointment for 4:30 am. We'll make sure we get back in time, hop off. Gee, I don't know your name. Libby. Very pleased to make your acquaintance, Libby, my name is Carson, shall we? Wait, the book - Sure, sure, here you go. We were supposed to visit grandma in Oklahoma but Dad kept putting it off. He said it was better, having only three weeks of vacation. Go to San Francisco, go around Lake Tau and then go through Las Vegas. The little sister would have been taken care of by Aunt Fanny. Wait a minute, this is not the way to Disneyland, it's going towards the ocean. I have to stop somewhere first, didn't I tell you? Look, I don't want to go to Disneyland anymore, let me get off. Please open, open - Stop. What are you doing? Stop. Hey, stop. - Where is the owner of that car? - That's Dr. Chaney's car. - Do you have an appointment? - We don't need appointments. - Hey, wait a minute, what the... - Leave it, I'll take care of it. Please take a seat over here. So, you want to talk. What do you mean? It seems to us that you must be the one to speak. How much do you want? What do you want us to say, make us an offer. So, let's see, $1,000? - Are you okay with that? - I would say yes, 500 per head. Unfortunately I don't have enough cash at home. - Alright, a check? - It's fine with us, we trust you. Don't think I don't realize that you are blackmailing me. However, I still thank you for not going to the police. Who should I make it out to? You can also leave it blank, we will take care of it. It sure is nice to cash in. Here you go, no hard feelings. Of course not, doctor, you've been kind. Excuse me, can I offer you a glass of wine? Thank you very much, what kind of wine do you have? This is a very good California nectar, I am sure you will appreciate it. That's my favorite one, how about you, Bull? If there is no beer. Thanks. I hope it's all over. Don't worry, we have never seen it - Of course. We reached the inner wall in half the time. This time it will work, I'm sure of it. No, it doesn't work, we are still too slow. Bring in the other one. Bull... Bull, help me. Please don't joke. What did you do to me? Hey, Bull - Where are they? But where the hell are they? But what's going on? But I can't see I can't see, Georgio. Leave me - Why? Leave me - Why? No - Wretch. Leave me alone, stop I don't see you, I'll kill you - Bull, let go of me. I'm gonna kill you - Stop them, Dan, stop them I'll kill you - I can't take it anymore. It's useless. We are all like you. None of us is to blame. Calm down... calm down. Calm down. Dan... Dan - What is it? Come... come on, he's sick. What's wrong with you, are you sick? It's her... she is the one who is sick. She is dead. Not possible, no. Not possible, not possible. We will all end up like this. None of us will get out of this hell alive. I know how to get out of here. - Who are you? - A poor blind man like you. And what do you want? I was telling you that... I... I know how to get out of this trap. You have to help us, man. None of us has sufficient strength now to do what must be done. Wait... wait. Soak it a little. Stop... stop. It's coming. One moment, Bull, let me hear. It's almost done - You're right. I'm afraid... I am afraid. Be brave, brother, I'm gonna get you out of here. Help me, Bull. Come on, pull... pull. Hey, sponge, get up. And get out of my way. Go and dirty somewhere else. And go away... via. Hey! - Hey! - Go away. Hey, you'll get better soon. I'm fine now too. When was the last time you ate? But why do I drag myself like this? Don't touch me I can get up by myself. What do you want? There's a small restaurant just around the corner, come and eat something. No, no, give me some money to buy a drink. You'll drink when you want but first you have to eat, come on. No, no, wait. Are you sure you have the money? Do you have the house? Maybe you also have a car. I'm a doctor - What are you? Look at this card, doctor, can you read? You are a doctor, bravo. So, you must have a lot of dough. The doctor. Look, now I can drink for a month. No no no no. What happened? Are you sick? My sickness is something else - Leon, something serious happened. One of the girls died and I... I had to get rid of the body. Oh my god! Leon, I can't take it anymore I said only one more try. It's the fourth time you repeat the same thing, don't control yourself anymore, Leon. This will really be the last time. And stop saying that I don't control myself. Hey, Dan - What, are you done? - Say, are you done? - There's a grate on the other side. Bull... Bull, what's going on? Shut up. How do we cut the bars? They are very wide, a thin person could do it. Yeah, and once outside he could ask someone for help. What's going on? I want to know. Let us think, please. There is nothing to think about, you have to cut the bar. And then where would it go? I tell you that a thin person can make it, I know this house well I can give you precise instructions. Dan, let me try, Dan - Send me. Please, send me. - You go - But why? - You go next. Listen to me, this hole leads to a big basement room that used to function as a woodshed, look carefully and you'll find a grating. From there go out into the park that leads to the street. Be careful and be cautious, now go. Help her... help her, Bull. Take care. At the slightest doubt, stop and try to reason. Leon... Leon, it's already late. - What was that? - I don't know. Stop. Sorry, Dan - Chaney. One more is missing, how will they escape? Katherine, follow me. Help me. Help, help, help. Stop, help me. In the name of heaven, stop, help me. Stop. I am blind, stop. Help me, stop. - Did you find her? - She is dead. Go ahead. I must open your eyelids if you want to realize. No, no, it is not necessary. Tell me again what you said. The victim did not lose his eyes in the accident because the scar tissue is old. - What does this mean? - That she had been blind for a long time. She was missing the entire orbits, I've never seen anything like it. - Did you find any glass eyes around here? - Not to my knowledge, no. No one has glass eyes inside their skull anyway. They would be of no use. You're right, doctor, why would they remove the entire orbit. Look, go back to the sidewalk - What manners. We know our job too, go away. - Do you know a good ophthalmologist? - The best one is doctor Leonard Chaney. It would be interesting to have his opinion. Chaney, huh? I'll see if I can track him down. Thank you - Not at all. You may go. You see, I have a busy schedule. I could come next Saturday if that is ok with you Saturday, huh? But you believe that the reason will be ascertainable why they took that girl's eyes out? She said she was in a car accident. Sure, sure, and a short distance from here. I think it's good for me to tell you something, doctor. We know how she died. But we would like to know why and when they took out her eyes. Maybe we could investigate at some hospital. Of course, but you are the highest authority on this matter. Well, I will try to do my best. However, I can tell you this. The causes could be syphilis, cancer, and many many more. You are telling me that to remove both eyes is not so extraordinary - Exactly. Although I must add that it is very rare in a person as young as the victim. All right, I've decided, I'll do the autopsy next Saturday. And I would like to examine the corpse myself. Very good - Oh, I'm such a scatterbrain. Can I offer you a glass of wine? Oh, no no no, thanks, I never drink anything during the service. Alright, see you next Saturday. I'm working like crazy. Because I want to give each of you your eyes again. As soon as I succeed. You'll come back to see, I swear I'll give you better eyes than yours, perfect eyes. As soon as I can, as soon as... I will have discovered the truth, I will share that truth with you. With the whole world. I believe in humanity. It is my hope, all my life I have always dedicated to others. That poor girl didn't have to die Dan, you know my work, because you have... Why did you do it? Why her? What need was there? Assassins. Assassins. Kathy... Kathy. I know you would have liked to do it. As I promised you. This is the last test, I swear to you, dear. Then. Oh, yes. Mom. Calm down, Georgio, calm down. Listen, listen to me. You'll see, you'll see we'll make it I'll get you out of here, Georgio. Katherine. Nancy, help us, Nancy. - Nancy. Child, are you awake? - Yes, I am. Now you'll see us, honey. And this is the good time. Now, I'll take off your bandages. And you will see me. It's all useless. I know it already. You were wrong, I was right. Child, let me help you. Come on, get up - No. Nancy - No. Stand up, that's good. You see, you see... look, look. Walk, move around the room. Look, see what a beautiful light. Get up, baby, get up - no, please. It's all useless. My face burns and my eyes hurt inside. My goodness, where did I go wrong? Every step seems perfect. Then why is my daughter, my sweetest Nancy. Why me, who would give my life for her. I can't help her. Oh, God! Nancy... Nancy, come back, come back. So, do you see us, do you see us? Nancy. Nancy, where are you? Stop. Stopped. No - Open the door I beg you, open - Nancy, the key is next to the door. Take it - Nancy, let me in. I'm the only one who can help you - Here it is Nancy, everything I've done, I've done for you. For love of you. Nancy, let me help you, please. In the name of God, open me. Now, you see, I know but if I don't take care of you, you might go blind again. Nancy, if you don't open this door right now, you're going to make me break it down. What do you want to do? Open the gate, open the gate. Give me that key. My studies are also applicable to you. You know, I could give you back your sight like I did with Nancy Dan
