Ivanov Stop him! Stop him! He is a criminal! He made an attempt on His Highness's life! Stop him! Stop him! What happened, Cipollino? Nothing at all, Uncle Grape. My father and I were standing there, watching... Prince Lemon and his escort walk down the street. Someone pushed me and I stepped right on the prince's foot. That's it. That's terrible! Serves him right! Get that villain! Find him immediately! Have you found him? Capture him this instant and hang him! Your Highness, Your Highness, it was me. I stepped on your foot. You?! Take him away! Just think-- that old villain Cipollone wanted to stab His Highness with a dagger! Nothing of the sort! That criminal had a machine-gun in his pocket. No no no, not a machine-gun-- a cannon! - Oh! - Shh. But fortunately the criminal has already been put in prison. Father! Cipollino, my son! Father, they put you in prison with criminals. Oh no, everyone here is an innocent, honest person. Why are they in prison? You see, Prince Lemon doesn't like honest people. Hang tight, Father. I will come back with my friends - and we will set all of you free. - Shh. It's not that easy, son. Think of yourself instead. Thank you, Professor. Don't be sad, little one. Let's go. Let's go. I'll introduce you to my friends. You saggy tomato in porridge! Sorry. If you only have one brick it's not good for much You cannot a house make With a single brick If you have a couple of bricks Lay them side by side You will only have two walls Not a pleasant house If you work with many bricks Maybe five or six You can make a lovely house Now where can I get some? Well, how is it going, old friend? I brought you a little present. Here, take it. Oh! You scoundrel! Thief! Rebel! You built a house on the land belonging to the Ladies Cherries! Get out of here! Out! Out! But Your Grace, the Count Cherry himself gave me permission. Silence! I confiscate it from you! We'll give this house... to a vicious dog! Get out of here! Go, go, get out! - Thief! - Silence! A thief? Where is he? Show him to me. No problem, Your Grace. Recognize him? You little scoundrel! You will pay dearly for my tears! Now you'll know not to mess with an onion! You, Pumpkin! I'm warning you. What happened, Cipollino? 10 lire per person Sleeping Potion Hello, Uncle Blueberry. This is Pumpkin's house, Uncle Blueberry. Could you keep an eye on it for a while? Signor Tomato wants to take it from Pumpkin. Please. You have always been kind to the old man and even saved his life once-- do you remember-- when a caterpillar got under his collar? Help him one more time. All right, but don't tell anyone where he's hiding. Thank you, old friend. Where is the house? Tell me at once. I ordered you to guard it, you worthless beast! You're a failure! So who stole the house, hmm? Who? Your Excellencies! Your Excellencies! Your Excellencies! What is it, Tomato? Pardon me, but a band of outlaws is active in the vicinity of the castle. Shh! Stay calm. Valuable property has been stolen! That's horrible! Ladies, remain calm. Exile him! Cactus! Cactus! Cactus! Your Excellencies, Cactus at your service. Cactus, where have you been? Lock the gates. Come back! Call Count Cherry immediately! Will do, Your Excellencies! Signor Cherry! Signor Cherry! Cherry! Your Excellency, you have been ordered to see the countesses immediately. Your aunties are in a bad mood today. Both of them. You're in trouble. Don't worry, Cactus. I'm used to it. Where have you been? Do your homework, lazybones! Be quiet! Put the book back! Learn this by heart! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Civilians are not allowed to carry weapons. I'll take that. A coded message! I'll take that. Hurry up. Someone's waiting for me. We have to capture another criminal. Have you captured many criminals? Strange. The shortest distance between two points is a straight-- That's correct! That's correct. We know you. You are Count Cherry. Yes. What's your name? Radish. My name is Cipollino. I heard about you too. - From whom? - From Signor Tomato. He was bad-mouthing you, so I knew right away that you must be a wonderful boy. Great! What a lovely place! Cherry, you're a good boy. You see, I want to ask you to do something very important. We need to get a hold of a key-- you know, the key to the basement. You see? My friends are in the basement. What was that? Very suspicious sounds. We need to reinforce the castle guard because there are many prisoners in the basement. Who knows what might happen? Let's see, let's see... Signor Count! Cipollino! Don't be upset, don't be upset, Signor Tomato. They say if you're upset, you'll lose all the vitamins. Cipollino! Cipollino. Leave Cipollino alone. He is my friend. Where is Radish? Call Radish. Looks like he has a fever. Call the doctor immediately. More expenses! Count Cherry, I'm glad you're feeling better. Cactus, where is Cipollino? The key from the basement. Shh. Shh. Shh. - Cipollino! - Shh. Come out, quickly! Shh. Signor Tomato, Signor Tomato, the prisoners have escaped! Ouch! HANG FIND ARREST HANG We must immediately find and arrest the mastermind-- Cipollino! Yes, Your Highness. Let's call in the famous Detective Carrot and his illustrious dog Vacuum Cleaner. Do it. Arrest him! My God, they will destroy our entire park. Oh, Countesses, don't interfere. The soldiers are looking for vicious criminals. We are going abroad this minute! Yes yes! Where is Tomato? Where is Strawberry? Cherry! Pack your things immediately! Where is he? We're leaving. I won't go anywhere! I have friends here. What friends? What friends? What happened to you, Carrot? Ladies, get hold of yourselves. Cipollino! Father! My boy. Ready? Let's begin. Signor Chief, let me congratulate you on the capture of the criminal mastermind. These are for you. Thank you. I'm in a hurry. We must punish that rebel Pumpkin and destroy his house! Recently, our state income has decreased. After we announced the tax on air, you started breathing less! That's outrageous! Silence! In addition, we announce a new tax on precipitation. The tax on ordinary rain is 100 lire. The tax on heavy rain is 200 lire. On a storm with thunder and lightning-- 300 lire. Silence! - Cipollino! - Father! Stop! Stop! And finally, the last thing: As a punishment for insubordination and rebellion and in order to avoid further disturbance, Pumpkin's house is to be... destroyed! Stop! Stop! Stop, greedy insatiable bandits! You're ready to take the shirts off our backs! We won't give you Pumpkin's house. Go away! Get out of here! Your Highness! Your Highness! Your-- Your-- Your Highness.
