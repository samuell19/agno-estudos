Somewhere in the world, but outside of it... ...live a strange cult whose origins are lost in the mists of time. Possessing some powers, established as popess. One woman named Géziale will honour this tradition. A man wanted to be initiated by this woman. You are always determined to go through with these tests? Good. Let's hope you will be rewarded for your courage and tenacity. They aren't venomous. Except for one. If he bites... It'll mean that you can't join us. Throw in some more. You'll return very late tonight? Isn't it my right? - Obviously. But the wedding. What will you do? It's a rubber band, not a chain. You must do it, darling. I'm not a civil servant, but an artist. Artist in what? Whores? No, in unrestrained liberties. I need this to live in another dimension. What about me? You don't think I need to live in another dimension? A good home for starters. Yes, a good home that's not in the middle of an open crevice. When you met me and I told you my plans, you liked them. It's you I liked, not your stories of magic and spectres. You have to realise you can't have one without the other. For three years I've waited for your intellectual and physical complicity. I wanted you to be exceptional. - Exceptional? How about that. My God, I must be dreaming. Don't keep dreaming. It's not your speciality. By the way, that's why we'll never get along together. Aline, we should break up now. Breaking up? Never. As you wish. In the mean time, I'm getting out of here. Bastard. You're nothing but a bastard, a loser. That's it. A loser who wants to succeed elsewhere. Let me go. Watch out. - You too. I'll let you think about it overnight. Enter my world, or I'll eliminate you. You'll kill me? I wouldn't... Not everybody is like you. Are you ready? - I think. So let's begin. - Right now? Force your will. You believed you were bitten during the snake test. But you hung on. But that's because you intervened at the last moment. Without you I was done for. Let's say I had a weak spot for your courage. Don't make me regret it. Do you still want to see her? Yes. More than ever. Then you must endure all of this. Until the end, you know that? She wanted us to add some salt to the water, to increase the suffering. You won't hold a grudge against me afterwards? No, but make it quick. Throw the remaining water on his face. He has to be conscious when he receives the last six strokes. Look, bitch. Look. Here's the fate that awaits you. Penitence for the sinner. Whip, brothers. Whip. Extirpate this lost soul out of this unnameable carrion. Repent, cursed one. For now you'll unite with death. Stop now, brothers. And let's pray. It's not possible. Tell me it's a bad dream. I'm not insane. No. Enough. Drink... You'll feel better. Did it do you any good? - Yes. It's very strong. This is a decoction made from rare plants. It's my speciality. I added some alcohol. I noticed. I feel filled with fire inside, just like Borg... Listen to me, Laurent. I telepathically transferred some of your pain to your wife. Without this, you wouldn't be able to stand Borg's whip strokes. Did it hurt her? - More than on you. I directed at her, waves of suffering. She probably dreamt that she was being tortured. A dream that'd fit her level of consciousness. Can I believe you? You must believe me. You will later realise that for this type of thing, I never lie. Is that her... ...who gave you all these powers? Yes, that's her. And she gave me many more. She knows terrible things. She is more than a magician. She is exceptional. Sometimes she frightens me. Soon you'll know her. And when will she come? They went to get her. Now you are worthy of meeting her. In my state... I don't know if she'll like me. Wait, I'm going to fix it. You know, Iltra... I already thought you had some talents in art school. But for healing, you have even more. Shut up. You talk like an idiot. A candle to light up a whole bedroom... A candle. Laurent... Come back. I'm afraid. She is with them. How do you know that? I know it, that's all. What are you doing? You see it. I'm putting out the fire because she doesn't want you to see her. Not yet. And now don't ask me any more questions. You must shut up and obey. Head down. And don't move anymore. Do you accept to subject yourself, to forget your personality, in order to receive what I'll teach you? I accept. You have a repressed and neurotic wife. She will make an excellent medium. I must have her. You will have her. Good. I see that you are accommodating. Give me the acceptance kiss. Do you want me to recount? You don't trust me? Here, take your share. This... my share?. You think I'm mad or what? Listen to me. When the old man jumped out of bed... ...who stabbed him? It was me. Not you. You were merely the look-out. Is that so? But who put you in the know? Who knew the old man was alone with his money? It's not you, that was me. And that's worth something. Go on, pass me my share. Half. Take it yourself. Come on, try it... So what? Are you taking the money? Listen, Louis... Can we discuss this without causing grief? Did you hear that? That's no animal. Let's find out. We'll divide later. The key... I forgot... Do you see anything? It looks empty. - Are you sure? Anyhow, I don't see anything. They won't get me alive... Forget it. Let's have a look... Just drop it I tell you... Why? There might be something to steel. I'm certain there's something in this room. She almost did it. - Almost... Fortunately there wasn't many left. Why did you do that? I don't know. Laurent, I'm hurt. My head is heavy. Some thieves... They were here, very near. I thought they would kill me. But what are you talking about? They entered the room? I don't know. I saw them watching through the window. They believed the house was empty. Don't leave me alone here, in this horrible house. Prepare a cold compress. Who's she? A friend. A good friend. It's for her that you left tonight? No, but I'll leave again if you don't come with us. Laurent... Don't leave me. So, come. Where? Somewhere where you'll be happy. I can't stay alone here anymore, in this shack of misfortune. You see, you're cared for. I knew that she'd be reasonable. Take this to her. She must eat it all. Eat, eat. Soon you will need all your strength. This woman is here to surpass herself... To overcome her principles. Break her mental structure. And finally find herself worthy of being accepted by us. Trust me, there'll be a lot to do. But we'll succeed. Laurent... Look at me. I used to be like her... A poor creature. But I've realised myself by finding my true self. Thanks to Géziale. Good. That's enough. She's ripe. Hélène will put her outside. Borg and Steve will desecrate her in turn. But she'll have this... ...for her defence. Now, if it's not convenient for you, you can refuse. But you will leave immediately... ...And alone. - No, not alone. This is how one becomes reasonable. When we've judged you worthy of entering our brotherhood... We'll teach you how to conquer your fear. And now, action. Cabul, light the candles. Borg and Steve. Get ready. And the others. It's absolutely forbidden to leave. You'll follow everything... from behind this window. Do what you have to. You believe that... - Enough with you. I know what I'm doing. That's it, they're lit. Here comes the show. She defends herself pretty fiercely. Don't worry, soon she'll be asking for more. I bet you he won't make it. Lazy bones this Borg. I'll give him another minute... past this limit he will be eliminated. He got her. He really uses all his effort. Come on, scoff. It's amazing how much it can gobble. That's the second bucket since this morning. She's going to ruin the community. My job is very hard, you have to admit. 'Cause in the pigsty, you need master strokes. Oh I believe you... And she won't turn into bacon anytime soon. It's still a beautiful animal, isn't it? Sure, but we'll be the judge of that when she's on our plates. You forget that I'm a vegetarian. Dude, what are you doing? Seasoning. But that's going to change the taste. Of course not. A sow is never a delicate dish. But look, she doesn't want to eat anymore. We'll see... What did I tell you... Nothing's better to stimulate her appetite. You can really handle these beasts. I know the ways of all animals, Lina... even primitives. You're a beast... The real beast. If I'm the beast, you're the beauty. My beauty? You are a dirty pig, dirtier than her. Don't worry, every one of us went through an initiation. She needs to go back to a stage of bestiality. We shatter the fruit, to pull out the almond. Be calm, Aline, be calm. Say Borg, you could've cleaned her before. De-griming bitches isn't my speciality. Come on, take care of her. Hold her tight. You're going to calm down? Is it ready? It's ready. his wasn't planned. Don't burn my tooth purse. Don't worry... In case of damage we'll put it as "overheads". You'd better end this instead of chatting. Shut up. All good craftsman must take his time. And his pleasure... Silence, please. The moment is serious. That's it... She is now ready for tonight's big test. My friends... I thank you all for coming to this ceremony. As a daughter of Darkness, I have a mission to prepare the coming of the reign of women of all races... who will work in the era of Aquarius. These women, who were persecuted by most religions, will recover their original powers and will give love its initiatory and sacred power. But before we reach this goal, this evolution of humanity... I will not hide from you that the struggle will be rough and long... As the forces of evil won't let themselves be dominated. Now, let's sing... as a tribute to our mistress of clarity who has on us the power of life and death. Come closer. I want to make you... and in spite of you, a daughter of Darkness... because you're the wife of one of us. Through the bonds of blood, you'll serve and support this ceremony. I hope you'll be worthy of our trust. Lie her down here. Let's accomplish now the rite of the burial pit. Shibboleth and Haïnam, great protectors of this Sabbath. Please accept this sacrifice. Moon... You who influence the sap of the world. Accept this symbolic offering of ecstasy and agony. Taken from life and from death. Make my body age and die... while I drink this liquor that you've imbued with your beam. Stand up. Soon you'll be one of us. Give me the kiss of submission. Bitch. Borg. Get her. Let me go with him. Let the Sabbath begin. Lie here Xavos. And don't move. Soon I will love you like two women. Because I'll be that one too. How can you? I'll drink her lifeblood with all my strength. Your wonderful. Shut up. Look. What are they doing to her? She's being prepared for the continuation. She must be free of me. A fragment of my spirit is inside her, devouring her. Now... Take me. I must leave her body... Quickly. Let Darkness's fire manifest and purify them. I see the other side. Now anything is possible. He came back... The death-master. Well? - It's done. Xavos is guarding her. Good... May the Sabbath continue. Where is she? In a safe place. The Groules' cave. What are the Groules? Disembodied creatures eager for sexual food. Won't they kill her? No, just the opposite. They're very pleasant... If one likes their touch. But after all... Why do you care? I don't. So, come. Stop mentioning her... I invite you to the feast. Go to sleep. - Sleep. You must sleep. Laurent... Help... You thought you could escape me? Aline was calling me. I dreamt it, but I know it's real. I thought that you didn't love her anymore. Yes, I don't love her anymore, but... But what? I can't leave her like this. Since you feel noble and generous... I'll allow you to free her. But for that... Our code requires... that you undergo the poison test. Borg. Prepare the goblets. You see those two goblets filled with wine? In one of them... I added a slow poison... that will take effect in a few hours. You have to choose one. And drink it all. If you refuse, you will be left to the Borg's hound, and your wife to her misery. Those who are initiated to Isis' mysteries even to only the first degree, like you... Shouldn't be afraid of death. Then again, you've a 50/50 chance. Perfect. I wasn't expecting less from you. We will now free your wife. Enjoy it. Since today may be the last. Because I drank the poison? You will know tonight. At sunset. Here you go. Free her. It's me, Laurent. You are free... Come out. You're safe now. Come out. Stay still. Sheath your blade. Leave her. Laurent... You want to leave with this fool? You... go. If I were you, I'd be wary of her. You never know with someone that deranged. Someone has to escort her. And lock her up my house until I get back. Despite everything... In her state she can't be a danger to us. I like how you can make decisions. Since the goblets test, you deserve to be called a man. If you live through it, I will take you as a 2nd degree spouse. Borg. Do as he said. Especially don't hurt her. You can count on me. Come down. I won't do anything, I promise. What a waste. Come here. Here. Come... Lick. Lick that off, bastard. There. Clean it off. Quick. Are you hurt? It's nothing. I stepped on Xavos and he bit me. And Aline? With this injury, I couldn't catch up. Too bad... Maybe that's for the best. Who's the hole for? - We're preparing it... It's almost sunset. It's a funny place to sleep. I don't want to die. - I beg you, show some dignity. Dignity won't prevent me from dying. Who gives a damn about dignity. I'm hurt... It's burning me. Laurent, listen to me... Once again you made a courageous choice. Don't spoil it making such a fuss. Geziale mustn't be ashamed of you. I can't take it anymore. - Shut up... she's coming. Here's the wages... of your dedication... Bad luck. And all that for an unworthy woman. But why? - You see... This is real pain... All others are imaginary. - How's that? There was no poison in the goblets, just a bit of salt in the one you drank from. You were making fun of me? - It's less serious than poison, right? And I wanted to know if you had the courage to confront me tonight. Tonight... Because tonight you're going to make me a beautiful child. It'll be the child of Darkness. He'll announce the coming of the priestesses of Aquarius. You're giving me hope again... by choosing me. You've all the time to enjoy yourself. I will demand everything from you. Our mating will be ruthless. You hear me? Ruthless. All of your lifeblood must transfer into me. This could be your last night. But what a night... If I gave the order to dig this grave, it's because we never know. Thereby... I declare you united, by link of blood, and by the fire of the salt. And may the child you'll conceive, be the physical... and spiritual completion of the great passion that binds you. From the spirit of The Darkness that breathes within you... I bless you. May the forces of the black earth and the red moon, unite within you. Take away her cape. I said take away her cape. Give her the beverage of ecstasy. More. Are you ready? - I am. You are now only a bitch. A thing to impregnate. Do you know this? - I do. I accept it. - So go on then, dance... Dance. Faster. More. Be excited. It's almost time. Possess her... Quickly. Laurent, look out. Now you live in me... through me... for us all. Let's bury him with the respect he deserves. Come on.
