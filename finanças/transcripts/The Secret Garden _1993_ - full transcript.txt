CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS. MY NAME IS MARY LENNOX. I WAS BORN IN INDIA. IT WAS HOT AND STRANGE AND LONELY IN INDIA. I DIDN'T LIKE IT. NOBODY BUT MY SERVANT, MY AYAH, LOOKED AFTER ME. IT WASN'T MY FAULT! MY PARENTS DIDN'T WANT ME. MY MOTHER CARED ONLY TO GO TO PARTIES, AND MY FATHER WAS BUSY WITH HIS MILITARY DUTIES. I WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO TO THE PARTIES. I WATCHED THEM FROM MY MOTHER'S BEDROOM WINDOW. I WAS ANGRY, BUT I NEVER CRIED. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO CRY. LOOK, ROWAN, THE MAHARAJAH! THE MAHARAJAH. [WOMAN LAUGHS] [MAN LAUGHS] I LEFT MY FAN IN HERE. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO FOLLOW ME. BUT I WANTED TO. MY PARENTS ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT THEMSELVES. THEY NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT ME. IF ONLY I COULD'VE KNOWN THAT IN A FEW MOMENTS I WOULD LOSE THEM FOREVER... [MAN SHOUTS] [WOMAN SCREAMS] Man: EARTHQUAKE! EARTHQUAKE! AAH! [ELEPHANT BELLOWING] [SHIP'S HORN BLOWING] THE FAMILIES OF THE INDIAN EARTHQUAKE ORPHANS SHOULD PLEASE GO TO DOCK NUMBER 2.

WHAT A QUEER, UNRESPONSIVE LITTLE THING, AND, MY WORD, A PLAIN PIECE OF GOODS. HER MOTHER WAS A BEAUTY. SHE CERTAINLY DIDN'T HAND MUCH OF IT DOWN, DID SHE? OH, SHE MIGHT IMPROVE AS SHE GETS OLDER. CHILDREN CHANGE. WELL, SHE'LL HAVE TO CHANGE QUITE A BIT, AND IF YOU ASK ME, AND THERE'S NOT MUCH TO IMPROVE HER AT MISTLETHWAIT MANOR. COME ALONG. IT'S A PITY FOR YOU THAT YOU HAVEN'T ANY OTHER PLACE TO GO. YOUR UNCLE ISN'T GOING TO TROUBLE HIMSELF ABOUT YOU, THAT'S FOR SURE AND CERTAIN. HE NEVER TROUBLES HIMSELF ABOUT ANYBODY. AS IF HAVING A CROOKED BACK WEREN'T CROSS ENOUGH FOR A MAN TO BEAR, AND THEN SHE HAD TO UP AND DIE ON HIM. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. YOUR AUNTIE'S DEAD, DIDN'T YOU KNOW? DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER TELL YOU? NO. STRANGE. NOT TELLING YOU THAT HER OWN TWIN SISTER WAS DEAD. MY MOTHER DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO TELL ME STORIES. OH, AT LAST. THERE'S MISTLETHWAIT NOW. YOU'LL GO STRAIGHT TO BED FOR A FEW HOURS.

WHAT DO THEY DO WITH CHILDREN IN INDIA, CARRY YOU AROUND IN A BASKET? HOW DARE YOU TALK TO ME WITH SUCH DISRESPECT? NOBODY'S GOING TO CARRY YOU AROUND MISTLETHWAIT MANOR, MY GIRL. WE'VE FAR TOO MUCH WORK ALREADY, SO YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO LOOK AFTER YOURSELF. THERE ARE NEAR A HUNDRED ROOMS HERE. THIS ONE AND NO OTHER IS YOURS. DON'T EXPECT TO SEE YOUR UNCLE BECAUSE IT'S CERTAIN YOU WON'T. YOU'RE NOT TO TOUCH ANYTHING, AND YOU'RE NOT TO GO WANDERING AND POKING ABOUT. [WAILING] [CRYING] MARTHA! THE HOUSE SEEMED DEAD, LIKE A SPELL HAD BEEN CAST UPON IT. IT LOOKED JUST LIKE MY MOTHER'S ROOM. THIS MUST'VE BEEN MY AUNT'S. THE DRESSING TABLES WERE THE SAME. THEY EVEN HAD TWIN IVORY ELEPHANTS. MOTHER. [GREENSLEEVES PLAYING] [WAILING] [CRYING] OH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT DID I TELL YOU? I HEARD SOMEONE CRYING. DOGS. NO. SOMEONE. A PERSON CRYING. YOU HEARD NOTHING OF THE SORT.

WAITING ON ME MAKES YOU MY SERVANT THEN. YOU ARE STRANGE. EH, I KNOW THAT. MRS. MEDLOCK GAVE ME THE PLACE OUT OF KINDNESS TO ME MOTHER. SHE SAID SHE COULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT IF THERE WAS A GRAND MISSIS AT MISTLETHWAIT. I'D LIKELY NEVER TO BE LET OUT OF THE KITCHENS, AND CERTAINLY NOT UPSTAIRS. STOP IT! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I THOUGHT ALL GIRLS LIKED TO BE TICKLED. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO WEAR? BLACK... BLACK, OR BLACK? ARE YOU BLIND? THEY'RE ALL BLACK. HA HA HA. AND I WON'T BE LAUGHED AT, SERVANT. MY NAME'S MARTHA. I WON'T TICKLE YOU. I PROMISE. WHAT DO THEY WEAR IN INDIA? WHEN I HEARD YOU WAS COMING FROM THERE, I THOUGHT YOU'D BE A NATIVE. WHAT? YOU THOUGHT I WAS A WHAT? YOU--YOU-- YOU DAUGHTER OF A PIG! AAH! YOU NEEDN'T BE LIKE THAT. I'VE NOTHING AGAINST NATIVES. AS MOTHER SAYS, WE'RE ALL OF US A FAMILY. I'VE NEVER SEEN A NATIVE. I WAS PLEASED TO THINK I WOULD. YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING! NONE OF YOU! NOTHING! PLEASE. DON'T BE VEXED. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING, LIKE YOU SAID. I'M SORRY, MISS. I'M TOO COMMON, AND I TALK TOO MUCH. I BEG YOUR PARDON, MISS. I DON'T KNOW WHEN EXACTLY YOUR UNCLE WILL CALL FOR YOU. MY UNCLE? MRS. MEDLOCK SAID HE WOULDN'T WANT TO SEE ME. AH, BUT HE DOES. [DOOR OPENS] OH. YOUR UNCLE'S DECIDED NOT TO SEE YOU TODAY. WHEN WILL I SEE HIM? TOMORROW? OH, NO. HE'LL BE GONE TOMORROW. [DOOR SHUTS] Martha: AFTER THE MISTRESS DIED 10 YEARS AGO, LORD CRAVEN WOULDN'T SEE PEOPLE. THERE WAS NOBODY TO EASE HIS SORROW.

WHAT? THE ONE WITH ALL THE IVY. I DIDN'T SEE A DOOR. THERE ISN'T ONE. THERE HAS TO BE A DOOR SOMEWHERE. NO ONE'S BEEN INSIDE THAT PLACE FOR 10 YEARS. WHY? WHY? WHY? BECAUSE WHEN SHE DIED, MASTER GAVE ORDERS TO SHUT IT UP FOREVER. WHO DIED? [CHIRP] [WHISTLING] WHEN MY AUNT DIED? IT WAS HER GARDEN, WASN'T IT? [WHISTLING] LOOK AT ME. [WHISTLING] ANSWER ME, YOU!

IN INDIA WHEN IT RAINED, MY AYAH WOULD TELL ME STORIES. IN ONE OF THE STORIES, THERE WAS EVEN A GOD WHO SORT OF REMINDS ME OF YOU. WHEN HE WAS GROWING UP, HE HAD TO BE KEPT A SECRET SO NO ONE WOULD SEE HIM OR KNOW WHERE HE WAS. REALLY? WHY? 'CAUSE HIS UNCLE WANTED TO KILL HIM. THE UNCLE HAD A DREAM THAT THE YOUNG GOD WOULD TAKE OVER HEAVEN. WHERE DID HE HIDE? HE LIVED WITH SOME COWS. HA HA HA HA! WAS HE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PEOPLE? ONLY ON THE INSIDE. WHEN YOU LOOKED DOWN HIS THROAT, YOU COULD SEE THE WHOLE UNIVERSE THERE. THE WHOLE UNIVERSE COULDN'T FIT DOWN ANYBODY'S THROAT. DOWN HIS, IT COULD. HOW? THAT WOULD MEAN HE'D HAVE TO BE BIGGER THAN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE TO FIT THE UNIVERSE DOWN HIS THROAT, AND YOU SAID HE LOOKED LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE ON THE OUTSIDE. THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S INSIDE THAT HE WAS DIFFERENT. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE SENSE. IT'S THE IDEA OF IT. THAT'S SO STUPID. NO, IT'S NOT. IT'S MAGIC. YOU CAN'T REALLY BE THAT STUPID. I AM NOT STUPID! YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU DON'T WANT TO! YOU CAN'T LEAVE. YOU WOULDN'T DARE! OH, WOULDN'T I? I'LL HAVE THEM DRAG YOU BACK IN! WILL YOU, MR. RAJAH? FINE! THAT'S JUST FINE.

YOU WON'T EVEN OPEN YOUR WINDOWS AND LET THE SUN SHINE INTO YOUR ROOM. HOW CAN I? IT'S RAINING OUT. EVEN IF IT WEREN'T RAINING. WELL, IT IT WEREN'T RAINING, MAYBE I WOULD. YOU NEVER HAVE. WHY DOES THAT MEAN I NEVER WOULD? I'M NOT SOUR! WILL HE EVER SEE COLIN? HE'S AFRAID TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM. HE'S AFRAID TO LOVE HIS SON? SOMETIMES WHEN HE'S HERE, HE STAYS ALONE FOR A WEEK. BUT COLIN WANTS TO SEE HIM. SOMETIMES HE STAYS LONGER. LONGER THAN A WEEK? 10 YEARS AGO, WHEN HIS WIFE DIED, HE LOCKED HIMSELF IN FOR OVER A MONTH. COLIN WAS SUCH A WEAK BABY. EVERYONE THOUGHT HE'D DIE, AND HIS FATHER COULDN'T BEAR LOSING HIM, TOO. HE'D SUFFERED SO MUCH ALREADY. COLIN? MY POOR LITTLE BOY. MMM. [WHIP CRACKS] THAT WAS THE NIGHT THE RAIN STOPPED, THE NIGHT SPRING CAME TO MISTLETHWAIT. MY POOR UNCLE FLED FROM IT, AS IF HE WERE ESCAPING THIS SPRING. [WOOD CREAKING] Dickon: MEDLOCK'S GONE!

EVERYBODY HATES YOU! YOU'RE SO SELFISH! YOU'RE THE MOST SELFISH BOY THERE EVER WAS! I'M NOT AS SELFISH AS YOU ARE! JUST BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS ILL-- NOBODY ILL COULD SCREAM LIKE THAT! I'M GOING TO DIE! WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT DYING? MY MOTHER DIED! BOTH MY PARENTS DIED! I'VE GOT A LUMP ON MY BACK! I'LL GET A LUMP LIKE MY FATHER! [SCREAMING] MRS. MEDLOCK, IT'S MASTER COLIN! IT'S MASTER COLIN!

I DON'T SEE HOW. YOU'RE JUST WEAK. DO YOU THINK I COULD GO OUTSIDE, SPORES AND ALL? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SPORES. IF I WENT OUT... MAYBE WE COULD FIND THE DOOR TO MY MOTHER'S GARDEN. IF WE FOUND THE DOOR... WE COULD GO INSIDE. WHAT IS IT? I DIDN'T DARE TELL YOU. I DIDN'T BECAUSE I WAS SO AFRAID I COULDN'T TRUST YOU... FOR SURE. WHAT? I'VE BEEN IN THE SECRET GARDEN. I FOUND THE KEY WEEKS AGO. GO ON. TELL ME. WHEN YOU OPEN THE DOOR, YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. THEN YOU GO DOWN SOME STONE STEPS. BY THE TIME YOU REACH THE BOTTOM, YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY FLOWERS. EVERY DAY NEW FLOWERS OPEN. IT'S LIKE MAGIC. BABY ANIMALS ARE BEING BORN. I AM GOING OUT IN MY CHAIR! IF THE FRESH AIR AGREES WITH ME, I MAY GO OUT EVERY DAY. OH, NO. NOT EVERY DAY, SURELY, MASTER COLIN. WHEN I GO, NOBODY IS TO BE ANYWHERE NEAR. NONE OF THE STAFF, NOT A SINGLE GARDENER. IS THAT CLEAR? YES, SIR. VERY CLEAR, SIR. WHAT DO YOU SAY IN INDIA WHEN YOU WANT PEOPLE TO GO? YOU SAY... "I HAVE SPOKEN. ALL DEPART." I HAVE SPOKEN. ALL DEPART. [FOOTSTEPS] [CROW CAWS] BUT REMEMBER... THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

I DID IT! [LAUGHTER] [BAA] [BAA] I DID IT! [LAUGHTER] [DOOR OPENS] ARE YOU A GHOST? IT'S ME! COLIN? SHH. MEDLOCK MIGHT HEAR YOU. THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HER ANYMORE. SHE'D DROP DEAD AT THE SIGHT OF YOU WALKING. SHUSH. HOW DID YOU GET UP HERE? I FOUND THE WAY BY MYSELF. YOU CLIMBED THE STAIRS? THIS IS JUST HOW I WANT IT TO BE WITH MY FATHER. I WANT TO SURPRISE HIM JUST LIKE THIS. I WANT HIM TO SEE ME BEFORE ANYONE ELSE DOES. I WISH WE KNEW HOW WE COULD FIND HIM. MEDLOCK MUST KNOW. WE CAN STEAL THE ADDRESS FROM HER. I'LL HAVE A FIT, AND WHEN SHE COMES RUNNING, YOU CAN SAY-- I SAW A DESK IN YOUR FATHER'S ROOM. IT HAD LOTS PAPERS ON IT. MAYBE IT'S THERE. I LOOKED, AND I COULDN'T FIND THE ADDRESS. BUT I DISCOVERED ANOTHER OF MY UNCLE'S SECRETS. [GROWLING] THERE'S ANOTHER ONE. HERE. THAT'S MY MOTHER THERE. I THINK THAT-- I THINK THAT'S MY FATHER. THAT'S ME, I THINK. I THINK SHE'S BEAUTIFUL. [GIGGLING] Colin: ATTENTION! OVER HERE. SMILE. SIT ON THE SWING, DICKON. LOOK AT EACH OTHER. NOW LOOK AT ME. HEY. HEY! HEY! HA HA HA! COME ON, DICKON! OVER HERE. MARY, YOUR HEART. YOUR HEART, MARY. BILLY, BILLY, BILLY. COME ON, BILLY. STOP ALL THIS. I AM WELL. WHY DON'T YOU WRITE MY FATHER AND TELL HIM TO COME BACK? BECAUSE I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU ARE WELL. YOUR PULSE IS MUCH TOO QUICK. AND THERE'S A DEFINITE SIGN OF FEVER IN YOUR EYE. JOHN, BRING THAT ICE. NO! DESPITE WHAT YOU AND YOUR COUSIN MAY THINK, YOU ARE STILL UNDER MY CARE. YOUR FATHER TRUSTS ME TO DO WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU, AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT I INTEND TO DO. OH! GOD, LOOK AT YOUR LEGS. THEY'RE ALL SWOLLEN AND RED. COME ON, WILL. [GASPING] IF I'M SO SICK, YOU OUGHT TO SEND FOR MY FATHER. NOW, YOU ARE TO STAY IN BED. YOU ARE NOT TO GO INTO THE GARDENS. GIVE ME THE ADDRESS, AND I'LL WRITE TO HIM MYSELF. YOU'LL DO NO SUCH THING. GIVE IT TO ME. I'VE HAD ENOUGH. BETWEEN THAT WRETCHED GIRL AND THE DANGERS OF THE FRESH AIR, HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU. YOU COULD BE CLOTTING. SHE PROBABLY TURNED YOUR CHAIR OVER. I WON'T STAND FOR IT, NOT ANYMORE. I WON'T STAND FOR ANY OF IT. COME ON, JOHN. OH, I'M KEEPING YOU CHILDREN APART. HE IS A VERY ILL LITTLE BOY. I'VE WORKED TOO HARD AND TOO LONG TO KEEP HIM ALIVE TO HAVE HIM KILLED BY ONE PIGHEADED, MEDDLESOME LITTLE GIRL LIKE YOU. COME ON, COLIN. IT'S SAFE. EVERYBODY'S GONE. BEN'S WAITING AT THE GATE. [FLUTE PLAYING] THANK YOU, BEN. WE'RE MAKING MAGIC HERE. WHEN I GROW UP, I'M GOING TO MAKE GREAT DISCOVERIES, AND THIS IS MY FIRST EXPERIMENT. AYE, SIR.

YOU LOCK HER IN? I'VE HAD TO, MY LORD. THAT'S HOW WILD SHE IS. MARY. YOUR UNCLE'S HERE. I BEG YOUR PARDON, MY LORD. PERHAPS THEY'RE IN THE GARDEN. THE GARDEN? WELL... I DON'T SEE HOW THEY CAN BE. IT'S QUITE IMPOSSIBLE. UH, I'VE DONE MY BEST, SIR. I REALLY HAVE, BUT WITH THAT CHILD DEFYING ME AT EVERY TURN-- SILENCE, MEDLOCK! SHE'S JUST A CHILD. I LEFT YOU IN CHARGE. I'LL RESIGN, SIR.

[LAUGHTER] [DOOR CREAKS] DICKON? I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. YOU'RE HERE. THE MAGIC WORKED. COLIN... THE GARDEN. LET ME SHOW YOU. [DICKON CRYING] IT WAS MARY WHO FOUND THE KEY. SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT INSIDE. MARY, WAIT. NO ONE WANTS ME. Dickon: MARY! AND THIS IS WHERE THE ROBINS NEST. FULL OF BABIES. THEY'LL BE FLYING SOON. THIS IS WHERE I WALKED FIRST. I WAS A... A BABY MYSELF. Colin: MARY! MARY! WHY ARE YOU OUT HERE BY YOURSELF? IT WASN'T WANTED. WHAT WASN'T WANTED? TH-THE GARDEN. YOU'RE RIGHT. I NEVER WANTED TO SEE IT AGAIN. YOU NEVER WANTED TO SEE COLIN. YOU BROUGHT US BACK TO LIFE, MARY. YOU DID SOMETHING I THOUGHT NO ONE COULD DO. DON'T BE AFRAID. I WON'T SHUT IT UP AGAIN. BELIEVE ME. THANK YOU. SHALL WE CALL COLIN? MARTHA. MARTHA! DICKON. WHAT'S HAPPENING? DID YOU SEE THEM? [GIGGLING] OH, LOOK! MASTER COLIN. MASTER COLIN. HE'S WALKING. THE SPELL WAS BROKEN. MY UNCLE LEARNED TO LAUGH, AND I LEARNED TO CRY.
