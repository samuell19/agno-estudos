Where is it? Where the hell is it? What are you talking about? I know you hid them again, didn't you? Do you think I'm stupid? Is that what this is? Give it to me now, or it's gonna get a lot worse! Stop it! We did not hide your shit! Give it to me! I know you have got it! Give it to me! Here! [WEEZING} No, no, no, no, no! We are not done with this. We are not done with this. We are not done here. We are not done! Do not move. You guys do not love me. Do not know what you two have become. Little brats. Hiding shit everywhere! Mom? 911, what is the nature of your emergency? Let me tell you a few things that I know. I know I am not staring into the eyes of angels. You are not innocent lambs. You are here because you are the worthless, weak, troublemaking, unwanted shit-stains in my pants. The outside world does not want you. But we do. The rules here are simple. One, do exactly what I tell you to do. Two, always follow rule number one. You see that? I see it. Looks like we got ourselves a little rebel. Another one. You got something to say to me? This is bullshit! OFFICE HALE>> Whoa! I think this one is special. You special, boy? Come on, man. He is just... He is just what, King? He is just a stupid kid. Is that what you are? Just a stupid kid? Go to hell! Show him what happens. Show him what happens, Payne. Get his ass up. I said get up! Get up! Please, no! OFFICER PAYNE>> See you already broke rules one and two. It is called the delousing pool. It is where we disinfect animals like you. You stay in this pool too long, the acid will tear your skin from the bone. Probably kill you. If I were you, I would swim across as fast as you can. Look who is up. Come on. You still feeling froggy. Go on. No. Go ahead. Jump! No, no. Come on, up. Hey, you are going to make it. Alright? Oh. Hello. My name is Anna. Please have some. Do you like pie? What is your name? Jeremy. I can see you are scared, Jeremy. Do not be. I want you to think of me as a safe place, ok? Nowhere is safe. You have to be strong in here. That is how we survive. But you have a mother out there waiting for you to come home. No I do not. Well then let me be your mother, while you are here. Sometimes pie makes everything better. Jeremy, what happened to your hand? Hey! What in the hell are you doing? No, no, no, no, no. Wait! You do not look at him. You do not talk to him. You do not touch him. You are going to go talk to the warden, Anna. Now, Anna! Good girl. We have an understanding, you and I. Do we not? You are here to cook. You are here to clean, nothing more. Those boys, they need divine intervention, not a mommy. You have your own child for that. You mean our child? What if someone were to hear you say that? Like my wife? I have not said anything. And you never will. You had no money, no future. I handed you one, right here so that I could see the child and you would have a life. I just want what is best for the child. I do not want to be any trouble. Good girl. Trouble could only begin with your mouth. Are you taking your pills, Anna? I do not need them anymore. I am not depressed. I am handling it. Well that is fantastic. Because without an education or a job or a purpose, well you would not be handling much. I pulled my own string so that you could be here to help raise that child. But theres... Something is not right. I think they might be taking things too far with these boys. You need to call your guard dogs and find out what is going on here. It sounds like maybe you cannot follow my rules either. Let us go over them again. You see nothing. You hear nothing. You are nothing. There is this boy Jeremy and his hand is bandaged and bloody and-- The mouthy one got away. Put the word out. Anna, you stay here. You understand? Where did you find him? Behind the gas station. What's the difference? Where's my sixty bucks? You ought to watch your tone. No, no. The man came straight to the point. I am sorry. I did not know you were already here. I never miss the return of my property. Of course. When will you boys learn you can not escape Preston? I am sorry. Shhhhhhh Just do not make me go in there again. I do not want you to worry. Ok? I promise, you will never have to see the inside of that awful place again. Handle that. Ok. Ok. Whatever this is, I can not be a part of it. I have a little girl to take care of and I am not doing it from prison. This has to stop. You pick that weapon up right now. Not necessary. No one is going to jail, King. You should go home and take care of your kid. What are you doing? He has been a part of this from the beginning, so who is he going to tell? No one. That is right. Well old chum, I accept your resignation. I would like to thank you all for joining us for the rehearsal dinner for the two or three of you I have not met yet, my wife and I are very happy you could join us from near and far. I am very very proud and honored to welcome Skyler into our family. Tomorrow the two of them will be wed. Skyler, you are such an amazing addition to the family. It is with great sadness of course that your father could not be with us to see what an extraordinary bright light you have become. He would have been incredibly proud, your mother as well who fought till the end. So I take even greater pride in having you as a daughter. My eldest, Derek... Good luck, Skyler with... Nate! Of course. What would an important occasion be without you somehow interrupting? I just wanted to say that I really need to go to the bathroom. What is wrong with your son? He is an idiot. Tay lor on the other hand, our maid of honor, thank you very, very much for being a part of the ceremony. I love you Skyler. Your father Steve, Larry and I, over there, we have worked and supported each other forever and a day, so- Alright now hold on a second. I want to say something. To my beautiful daughter Taylor, uh you two, do not get any ideas because on our salaries we cannot afford something like this. Who am I forgetting? My youngest, Sam. Sam! I do not have to use the bathroom. No, of course not. You do not have to. I am just letting you know I do not have to use it. Maybe later. Alright. Sam is also taking applications for a hot date. Well, my wife and I thank you all for being here. To Skyler and Derek. And the future. Hey, you ok? Yeah, I am fine. You do not look fine. Skyler, I said I am fine. Derek you know he loves you. Ok, do not take it personally. It is just the way he is. Look at all this. He just wants us to be happy. Stop! Stop. You cannot fix everything. Derek, Derek, do you still want to marry me? Yes. Yes I still want to marry you, Skyler. But he does not want us to be happy. He does not give a shit about me. All he cares about is Sam. All I have ever done is disappoint him. I am never ever going to make him happy. You realize that, right? You make me happy. Is that not enough? Skyler, that's not the point. You need, you always told me that you need. I can not do this Skyler. Skyler, I can not do this right now. Had enough of the dancing, eh? Something like that. Thank you for all this. Oh, you are very welcome. I am counting on you to look after my son. He needs you. You are going to get it woman. Talk is cheap, baby. Did you just hear something? Do not worry, I locked the door. Ok. Oh my God! You are on my sweater. Sam, what are you doing in our room? You are in my room. There were two keys. Did you take the wrong key? I do not know. Sam, I am so sorry. Could you-- I am starving. Give us uh um... Well, since we are here Are you joking? Apparently. Ok so I am going to get my hair done. Did you have your tux cleaned? The tux was cleaned. Sam. I was hungry. There is a wrong key for each room. Sam, you cannot come into peoples' rooms like-- Hey, it is ok. It is fine. How are you, Sam? This gift basket sucks. Ok, we will get you more food. Hey it is good to see you. College looks good on you. Ok, I am going to change really quickly and um Ok. Hey, look at me. If you come into my room again like that, I will break your God damned fingers. Do not move. Jesus Christ. Hey! So, Sam, I have not seen you in a while. What do you mean? I just saw you a few minutes ago without any clothes on. Tell her what you do now. I write software and stuff. Oh great. I use computers and stuff. Code just speaks to me. You know what speaks to me? Boobs. What are you working on now? It's a thing called Apparition. Oh yeah? What does it do? It allows us to connect the living with the dead. Jesus Christ, Sam! What? How does that work? It uses the home button, GPS and some old school binary code I have embedded in it. It does what? Mysticism, stuff from the dark web. A really remote back door led me to this. What is that? It's a picture of Elrik. Oh I love him, I have all of his albums. What did you do now, Sam? Elrik was a Shaman God who was the judge and ruler of the underworld. This picture dates back to about 600 B.C. And you just.. You just found it, right? Someone archived it. But I dug it up. They say he enabled believers to communicate with spirits. So maybe it will work the same way with the app. Yo, turn that shit on! Ok. Once the user thumbs over the sensor, it will activate or open a kinetic energy portal to a spirit in your bloodline. Really? In theory it will drop a pin on the person who wishes to communicate with you. What if you turn it off? Then the connection could be lost forever. So the real question is, who has the balls to go first? Mmmm, I got the balls. Yeah, that's my sexy girl. Oh what is the worst that can happen? APP>> Are you ready to begin? What the fuck? Housekeeping. No, we are good. Thank you. Ok. Nothing happened, Sam. You call that nothing? A blind person would say that was something. APP>> Oh my God. Yo Sam, there is no way that just happened. I do not know what just happened. The address, it is... It is what? It is Taylor's grandmother's house. How? How did you do that? I--I did not do anything. It is Taylor's grandmother's house. What is the big deal? We went to her funeral a year ago. How do you not remember? Yes I do remember. This could be some cruel trick, Sam. No, no. This is no trick. So, what do we do now? I am not sure. It has never worked before. What do you want to do babe? I miss her every single day. Let us do this. Hell Yeah! Road Trip! Awesome. Yo, this shit is about to get weird. Oh and this will add even more. They call it the Sixth Sense. Yeah, why is that? One hit and you seeing dead people, baby. Just what you need. Yeah. APP>> Are you ready to begin? Here we go. So after she got out of the hospital, I basically quit college to take care of her. I just felt too guilty. Guilty about what? She took care of me when my dad was not around. She was my rock. But while she was getting better I got in a huge fight with my dad and said a lot of things. Things I am not proud of. And I just took off for a few days and shut out the world. By the time I got back they told me that her lung had collapsed and she was gone. I never got the chance to say goodbye. I am sorry babe. APP>> We are arriving soon. Oh, it is the one right there. DEREK>> Alright let us get this overwith. Now what? APP>> Your connection is upon us. I do not understand. What is my connection? I guess that could be anything. I hope it is a naked ghost. What? What? You could hear that? How are we friends? You do not have any. Sam, how do we know where to start looking? Whoh. I am going to go wait in the car. Chickenshit! Come on. SKYLAR>> Oh my God. Oh, you ok? DEREK>> What the hell? NATE>> Your grandma is more of a freak than I remember. Ah, she used to make really beautiful dresses. I forgot she kept these. See that? Sexy ghost. Seek help. Oh my God. What is that? My grandmother gave me this necklace when I graduated high school. I was the first girl of my class to make honor role. She was so proud of me. The night I got in a fight with my dad, I was so angry I tore it off my neck and I threw it at him. Just to hurt him. She wanted you to know. She wanted me to find this. God, thank you. APP>> The connection has been made. How does it feel? It works. You actually did it. Let us work on that. So, who is next? You want to keep this going? Yeah. I do. What if it helps someone else? And what if it does not? What if it does some crazy shit? Skyler, we do not have time for any more egg hunts right? I want to go next. Skyler, do not touch that-- APP>> Are you ready to begin? Holy shit. Alright. Alright. Should we go? SKYLAR>> What am I missing here, Taylor? Well, we know our dads worked there together. There is a lot of information on the people there. And your dad, Skylar. DEREK>> Sam. About the man that killed him. SAM! Why is everyone saying my name? Because it is the shit we do not talk about, dickhead! This is the shit that got you beat up in High School. We have been over and over and over this. When will you get it? I am sorry. But it is right here. I know, Sam. So you know that he was never convicted? Even after two trials he was acquitted. Jesus Christ, Sam! Does it say anything else? It mentions Anna Collins. NATE>> Who is that? She was the housekeeper that worked there. She was killed too. They claimed Harold Johnson cracked her skull in with a bat. Then wrapped her up in a carpet. They say seven boys died there mysteriously as well. Seven? Jesus. They closed the school down after that. Maybe that is why my dad was so stressed out all the time. We should have just gone to the club. Hey I know you do not care but what if this spirit wants me to find something there? Ok, just like it did with Taylor. We will see. APP>> We are arriving soon. SKYLAR>> Ok, wait. It says to make a right at the next road. Could we get some fries with that? Alright, what now? Uh, I got this. DEREK>> Nate! TAYLOR>> What are you doing? It is not even locked. Open it. APP>> Your connection is upon us. It is up to you now. NATE>> Alright. It is locked. What now? Should we get a rock or something? A rock? Dude I am not cutting my hand on a window. Hey, nobody is breaking anything. Maybe there is another door. Yeah, where? I do not know. Maybe there is another door. Ok. Go find it, Sam. Skyler, I just tried the door. Ooh you do not know your own strength. Nice. Yo, this is cool. Wait, my phone does not have any signal now. The app is still working. Ok if there is no signal how is the app still working? It is not connecting to a cell tower. It is connecting to a spirit. Did you see that? Did you see that? Do not start with this paranoia shit. Give it time. You never have my back. Whatever, Skyler. You are seeing shit that is not even there. Look. What does it take with you? To pretend that you care? Justus Christ, you want to do this right now? Do what now? Find out what it means to give a shit about anyone other than yourself? Ok we are going to do this now. Nobody goes anywhere. Let us go. Come with me. Come with me, Skyler. Get off of me! Skyler get back here. Get your hands off me. I am going home. You know this is going to take a while, right? So I do not see why we should stand here for an hour as always and wait on their bullshit when we could wait on mine. Oh, what do I get out of it? More than booze, baby. Maybe I should just go wait in the car. How about you do whatever you want for the next fifteen minutes. Fifteen? Seventeen. Alright. Maybe I should just wait here. Enough of this shit, Skyler. We are going home, right now. No, no, no, no, no, no. You are going home. The rest of us are staying. This whole trip, this whole week, you have been acting like an asshole. I am the asshole? I am the asshole as always. Answer me this Skyler, why are we out here in the middle of nowhere the night before we are supposed to get married chasing your usual baggage, huh? I have no idea what you mean. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bullshit, you do not know what that means, ok? We are out here because of your mom, again. She died two years ago, Skyler. How long do the rest of us have to keep reliving this shit over and over and over? Get your hands off me! I think I am getting a text from beyond the grave. It is from your mom. She says "Shit happens, get over it already!" No wonder your father loves same more than he loves you. I can see why. He just does not have to take your shit like the rest of us. You ungrateful bitch. You spoiled, entitled dick. I could have anyone. You know that, right? I do not have to settle for you. Little orphan girl with a giant chip on her shoulder who can not get over the bad shit that happens in her life holding me down like a prisoner in her past. You know what? What? You are free. You can go. No more prison. That is great, Skyler. Really fucking mature. You know what? I am going to get that ring. And when I do, I am leaving. And you have two choices. You can be with me or you can be without me. Where are you taking us? Have a little faith. Ladies first. Uh-huh. Yo, check this out! Nate, do not touch anything. Oh my God, you know what this is? This is where they did electro-shock therapy on the boys that caused the most trouble. You mean like you? Yo, flip that switch. I got to to check this out. Are you crazy? Yo, babe, humor me. It is old. It is not going to work. Fine. Nate! Oh my God, baby! I can not turn it off. Ahhh, I am fucking with you. You are a total dick. Let me uh, check your temperature? It is warm. Mmmm, getting warmer. Oh so hot! I like where this is headed. Yeah. Yeah, come on, baby. Oh, where are we going? Jesus! Sam. Maybe I should wear a cowbell. Where did Derek run to now? That sounds bad. Is it bad? Yeah that is bad, Sam. APP>> Your connection is stronger. What do I do now? Well you have two choices. You could continue or you can let go and go find Derek. What if my mom left something for me? Then it seems you have already made your decision. So... let us do this. You are right. Where are Taylor and Nate? Probably creating dirty laundry. Sorry I asked. Hello? Nate! Hello? Is this a joke? APP>> You are approaching your destination. The guys better hurry. They would not want to miss this. Hey, I think it is saying go straight. Are you sure? Yeah, yeah I think so. Are you sure that is what she wants you to see? Skyler, what is wrong? What is it? Sam! Sam, oh Jesus. Please, say something. How high can you get off second hand smoke? Very? Yeah, ok. Let us go. Ok, I know they are done fighting by now so this is on us. They are not going to let us live this down until they are divorced. Oh that was cold. True, but cold. You know, I think it is time we take this to the next level. Hey after all we have been through you deserve my phone password. Really? You going to leave me hanging like that? Not even a giggle? TAYLOR>> Nate? Help me. I think I am lost. You did this to me. Taylor! Taylor! Taylor, Taylor? Baby, no! Wake up, Taylor. Baby wake up. Wake up Taylor, wake up! Taylor! You can not die on me, Taylor. Baby wake up. Taylor, please. We got to go. We got to go! Come on. Nate! No joke. I broke my fucking arm, man. NO, NO! The story you told about Anna, it had to have been in here. Well the article said she was the housekeeper. I guess it would make sense that she cooked too. Hey, wait wait wait, look at this. She must have been so close to them. Can you imagine what she must have seen and heard in a place like this? What was that? I do not know. It is time to go, Skyler. Right now. You understand? We need to find everybody. I want you to get out of here. I will find them. Sam, I am not going to sit in the car by myself. It is not safe for you here. Skyler, come on. Come on. You go down that way and I will meet you at the car. I will see you soon. Why would you not? Hello? Derek? Derek? Derek, come on now. That is not funny. Hello? We need to get out of here. Come on. Derek? Come on, Derek. Sam! Shit, come on. Fuck. Come on. Oh, shit. Fuck. Give me fucking reception, come on! Please, please, please, please. Please, please, please. Derek? Sam? Oh, oh my God. APP>> Connection is stronger. What is this? Come on. What do you want me to see, God damn it? Are you kidding me? APP>> Your connection is upon us. Why? Why here? Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help! What is all this? What else are you not showing me? Why am I here? Why am I here? Anna. Oh my God. Anna, Anna, he is right there. Anna, he is coming. You sure about this? Yes I am! He said, "At Preston. Help us." Why the hell would they come all the way out here? Do I look like I read minds? Oh you do not want to know what I am thinking right now do you? Do you want to really start right now? Everyone knows your son cannot stop a joke for five minutes. He is probably watching us right now. And you know your kid could get a check every now and again too. What do you think, White? We should have burned this place down when we had the chance. Yeah we could have if you did not improvise. I am not going to tell you again, ok? I put the blood in the right spots. You put it in so many spots you got a kid acquitted, twice! Twice! He would not have got-- Enough! Larry, check the SUV. Steve, you come with me. Help! No! No! No! No, I have seen enough. You think I need more than this? Dad. WARDEN WHITE>> Sam? Sam? Derek? What did you do to my father? Show me God damn it! No one is going to jail, King. You should go home and take care of your kid. He has been a part of this from the beginning. So who is he going to tell? No one. That is right. Well old chum, I accept your resignation. NO! You son of a bitch! I will kill you. I will fucking kill you! APP>> Your connection has been made. This is what you wanted me to find, dad. OFFICER HALE>> Taylor, Taylor! Taylor can you hear me? [EXPLOSION} Taylor! Taylor can you hear me? Taylor, are you hurt? Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! No, No, No, No, No. Help! What the hell? I am going to make it right. WARDEN WHITE>> Sam, Derek. This better not be a joke. Derek? Sam? I saw you die. What do you want from me? What did you do with my son? Please work. Sam, Sam, Sam. Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam. What happened to you? I do not know. They locked me in the room and then someone let me out. APP>> You take it. You take it, it is over. APP>> Are you ready to begin? I am not going back in there. Sam, it is not inside. It is over there. We need to call the police, Skyler. No, we need to finish this through. Come on. Why do you have a bat? Come on! How far is this place? In memory of Anna Collins proud caretaker of Preston School Mother of Sam. APP>> The connection has been made. What is this, Skyler? Anna Collins was your mother, Sam. That is not possible. They took you in after your father killed her. And they never told anyone. It is why you are still here. No. No. No, that is not true. Then why are you still here? My father tried to stop them. Sam, she loved you. How do you know that?
