John, will you ever be able to forgive me? - [John] Yes, you know I will. - [Woman] You understand, don't you? - [John] I do. - [Woman] You know why I had to do it. - [John] I do understand. - [Woman] It's just that I had no choice. - [John] Sweetheart, I already talked to Susan and I know you had no choice. There's one thing that's important here. - [Woman] What's that, John? - [John] We're together, we have each other. And I love you. - I hate movies. - Men ain't like that. - Not ones we see anyway. - Yeah not anymore, you got that right. - Life ain't like that. - Damn straight. - Oh, I don't know. - Uh oh, here we go, Einstein. (laughs) - Come on, let Susu talk. - Well, don't you guys got, I mean, have any dreams? I know that I'm gonna-- - [Everyone] Go to college. (laughing) (engine revs) - I'm gonna be an actress. I'm gonna get out from under Sharkey, just like Ros did. - You should think about leaving him yourself, Micki. - Are you kidding? - No. - Sharkey got me off the street. If it wasn't for Sharkey, Robby would be dead or more fucked up than he even is now. I'd still be my daddy's stupid little whore. - [Susu] You got any dreams, Micki? - Nah. - She wants a white house with a little picket fence around the yard. - Joey, I can't believe you said that. - Once a hooker, always a hooker.
