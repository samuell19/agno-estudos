< Secret Reuion > A long, long time ago, there was a tree... And a young man... who loved the tree. Every single day he came to the tree, and collected all falling leaves. Hyung-sook, l have to hang up. l'll call you back. (Coming home. . .) this time for sure? Of course, no matter what. You must teach her to take daddy's call even if she doesn't want to. (Maybe daddy didn't educate her properly.) Educate? lt's you, not me. l gave her the best education. Sending her to private school isn't good education. Sir! lt's Tae-soon! (You rarely saw her when you had the chance.) Okay, fine. l'll call you back later. (Don't bother.) l love you. (Bullshit!) Tae-soon, it's me. Okay, l got it. Thank you, you're a good guy. (client) (important work) (guide) (contact second-cousin) Doesn't make sense. How long will it take? About 3 days. Not good enough! Move over. What the. . . Excuse me. Which way is to Johan Cathedral? Johan Cathedral? Stay on this street... l could guide you better if you give me a ride. Been well? My kid's first birthday next month. Are you happy? Yeah, you? l'm leaving soon. You must miss them. How about a u-turn? No police around. - Now? - Now. Hey, where are you going? l'm sorry sir, l think l lost them. lncompetent bastard. Keep driving and go home, you idiot! Everyone get ready and standby. We don't know where they'll end up so wait in the car. Confirm last location. - Go on. - Yes, sir. Shouldn't we call the other team? And give them the credit? We can take care of it ourselves. Excuse me. l need to... use the restroom. Dance for me. l said dance. Trendy dance that the kids here like. Very nice. Looks like all our funding. . . went to dance classes. Since you're more agile, you come with me upstairs. And you stay below. What are you? Delivery man? Yeah. Kyung-nam, you look plain ven without the disguise. You don't drive well, get in the backseat. lt's Gui Soong-min apartment! Let's go! OK. Let's go! Wait, who lives there? Kim Sung-hak, Kim Jung-il's second cousin. Fuck me. Keep this. After it's done, we'll part on the first floor. Rendezvous at the terminal and go back together. Okay. l can already feel the bloodbath. Accent in front, out of the way! - lt's the director. - Shit How are you, director. (Agent Lee! What do you think you're doing?!) 'Shadow' is on the move. lf we loose him. . . (Shitbag! Why didn't you report this!) lt happened too quickly so l'll report afterwards. (No) l got you. That's all l need to do. Who is it? Morning, l'm from the church. ls Mr. Kim Sung-hak home? He went to the corner store. You are... mother-in-law? Yes, that's right. Slow down, you'll trip. l'm gonna get you! What? l don't think this was necessary. . . l'll be frank since you're like my son. Romantic Southerners. . . are whores. Every one of them. Look at them. She married a defector out of compassion and was killed because of it. OK. Come in here. We're here. Where are you, Tae-soon? You backstabbing rat, take a good look. You leached off our nation's generosities but publish a book that taunt our leader? l dreamt of killing you every night. lt's apartment #1 1 03. 1 1 03? You go first that way. - Go. Go. Come on. - Come on. - Which floor - 1 1th floor! Comrade... Son of a bitch! He's just a child. . . Remember. Our great nation cannot have... a single fragile son. How dare you betray me?! lt wasn't me. l don't know anything. Freeze! l just live next door. The boy was crying. - Min-chul, head up. - Yes. No problem downstairs. Get up. Hands up! Hands up, asshole! Check him! Check him. Are you okay? Can you hear me? He's okay. ls that you, Min-chul? Min-chul! What'up Min-chul? Son of a bitch! What's going on? Agent Ko! Shit. You... What... Come here. Get out now. Get the car around that side! - Pull back right away! - Ko Kyung-nam! Agent Ko! (Sir) What? Report now! (Sir, one went down!) Si-kyung! Where's your mom? - Take pictures of everything! - Yes, Sir. Ko, give me the physical description! What's going on? Over there, - more people coming out of there. - Yes, sir! l said pull back! - Seal that exit! - Out of the way! The suspect was 6 feet tall who wearing a black jacket. Piss off Get away Get in! Are you okay? l'm fine, get in! What about agent Kim? - He's dead. - Shit! Watch out! Move! Move! Watch out. . . Stop What the hell... Are you okay? Go! Keep driving! Yes, sir! Watch out for the people! Move! Out of the way! Be careful. l got you now. Floor it! Come on. Start now. . . lt's not the right time. Come on. What the hell? Why didn't you request backup?! Why?! We can't keep up with their pace... through normal chain of commands. We must act first... You be ready. (Unidentified man in his. . .) (50s opened fired,) (injuring many people. . .) Hello? (l'm the agent in charge.) We're not after you or Tae-soon. (Our target is a North Korean assassin,) (a high ranking officer.) He goes by many names but commonly known as Shadow. (That's who we want.) (With your help, we can get him.) l promise you, we'll help both of you (if we get him.) (Tae-soon said) you graduated from Kim Jung-il's military school. Aside from that, l don't know anything about you. Not even your face. We can talk later... if you're in a situation. l'll give you my number Memorize it. 01 1 -865-96... (Betrayal, unforgivable) (Two leaders got together. . .) (for the first time...) (in 55 years.) Hold on. l suffered through salary reduction and disciplinary actions. Now you want my throat? Getting honorable discharge before official staff reduction is a generous way for us to thank you for the work. Having too many agents on the field is too much burden for the agency. Burden? Were we getting paid to fool around? Our job is to catch spies so our people can sleep soundly. Times are changing. Hostility is not the answer anymore. Their field operations are coming to a halt. Fine. But at least let us finish this before cutting us off. l won't leave before catching Shadow first. Agent Lee. Stay out of this. You've caused more than enough problems. l lost my teammates who were like my family. But l still have to feed my real family. You're divorced. But l'm still paying alimony. What the... What am l saying? l can't just step down during my prime. You want to kick me out of here. This is why you don't get anywhere. You don't catch spies to make money. You're the reason why our agency is getting the bad rep. Looks like this was decided even before this meeting. ls it because of field problems? Or getting divorced? Just stick to one reason for termination. What did you say? Do you know why l didn't bother reporting? What's the point? You're goddamn pushover and a tool. Shut up Once is plenty enough. Where do you think you are?! Be clam, Sir. Don't hit him... Let go of me! Changing times? Fuck that! l'm a federal agent who catch commies! Get off from me Hey, don't do it! - lt won't be good. - You were gonna do it. lt's dirty. Hey miss, your food's great. Could l take some photos and post it online? Online where? An online club, for finding good restaurants. Sure. Come here and give me a hand. Quickly, customers are waiting. Here it is. There's address, phone number and even directions. For extra $2,000, we can bring her back for you. No, l'll go myself. Okay. Thank you. Looks like your life is hard enough. l hope that you'll be happier when your wife comes back. Your family can live happily together l'll be on my way then. Hey, Yoon-ji. Daddy? l'm working right now. Don't just like mommy. You have to be good. Yoon-ji, don't call me too much. Mommy won't like it. Mommy's not there? l'm not talking then. Don't worry about me, okay? Hello? Hey! lt's slanted! Quit fooling around! l'm paying each of you $1 ,500. You guys are highway robbers! (Specialists in finding runaway foreign wives) Chief! Congratulations on your promotion! You didn't need to come on a rainy day. These guys were brokering international marriages. Vietnamese, Filipino, Cambodian and other Asian countries. They bring the girls over, marry them then convince them that there're better men. They are local farmers They're ripping off poor farmers. Look at this appalling face. This is the boss. He's half Korean but worse than the Vietnamese. They were organized. We are organized too. l know you're the best man for this. They must be stirling quite a bit. The department put high reward on them. About $60,000. - Sixty? - Yes. l hear they go to the factory where many Vietnamese work. The boss goes nuts over soccer. He likes to gamble. - Go over there. Sweep thoroughly. - Yes. Do you know playing football? Hey! What are you doing? - You're not here to watch soccer! - Yes. Vietnam. Go on. - Jae-hwan. - Yes, sir. Do you see that guy in Yankees hat? Fat guy in white suit. Yes. l can't verify from my position, but what do you think? l'll check up close. Hey, hey! Not yet! That crazy idiot! l think it's him. Should l grab him? - Do you want to get killed? Get out of there! - Okay. Jae-hwan! Jae-hwan! Sang-chul, l can't spot Jae-hwan. Jae-hwan? Did you see a guy in Yankees hat? A what? Yangi? Find Jae-hwan first, quick! Why aren't you answering me! What are you doing here? Boss is looking for you. And why's your radio set off? You can't. . . Boss, we're fucked here. All right, l'll be there. Hey! Do your worst, come at me. That's it. l'll get the minions, grab that bastard over there. Got it? Now! Hey, where are you going?! You dare to leave me Fake? Fake? lt's a gas gun! Hey, hey, stop, stop! Stop it! l called the cops. Stop! l'm letting you live because the game was tied. l'll kill you... if we meet again. Shut it down! Go. . . Are you okay? Yeah. Are you a worker here? You're a Korean. Are you a cop? No, l run a small... They're wanted men. l was after the reward money. . . with a gas gun. You must be kidding Your name is? What for? Just want to thank you. Ki-joon! Go treat your wounds. Hey! What is it? lt's weird to ask you this like this, but would you consider working for me? What type of work? Finding people. lt's a real enterprise and well commended. Looked like finding wasn't the only thing. Ah, that happens once every 1 0 years if l'm lucky. l was helping out local cops. l'm find where l am. Of course. But l noticed that you may be an asset to me. Your name was...? Park Ki-joon. Park Ki-joon. Your fighting skills. . . l mean, physical condition. . . and you speak Vietnamese well. Where did you learn to speak? Most of our workers are Vietnamese, so... lt's perfect. l'm in the business of finding Vietnamese women. We haven't known each other long but why don't you come work for me? l like my current work. Of course. lt's time for me to go. How about you call me. Park Ki-joon my ass. l got you Ji-won. - Boss - Boss, are you okay? - Key. - Here. Live well, stop wasting your life. He's really leaving. Boss! - (Hello?) - lt's me. - (Who?) - lt's your daddy, idiot! (Who? Agent Lee?) - Kyung-nam. - (Yes, sir!) l just hit the jackpot. Who is it? Pork feet! Pork? Sir! You still go around like this? ls that true? Like l said. He's there as the manager. Ji-won didn't recognize your face? Of course not, he has never seen me. But you recognized him? l knew right away. Man, weren't you surprised? Did he not clue in? l pretended to be oblivious. lf l acted like l knew him, it would've been game over. You know l have a knack for acting. ln any case, thank you. My arrest rate isn't great lately. - Kyung-nam. - Yeah? l didn't call you to hand him over. Aren't you going to report him in? l'm leading this. You're just supporting me. Do you get it? No, l don't. Keep it away from the agency, you idiot! Okay. . . What's the reward for spies nowadays? $1 00,000.00 And spy ring? (Unification Policy Research Facility) You don't look well. l met an NlS agent a few days ago by chance. Lee Han-kyu, who looked for Tae-soon and l 6 years ago. Lee Han-kyu? Yes. He asked me to work for him as if he didn't recognize me. Looks like a private agency. On the surface. l'm sure it's just his cover. So? l don't know. Maybe submit an undercover report. Ji-won. How about surrendering? You made me into. . . what l am in military school. And now you're asking me to betray my country? - Like you? - Watch your mouth! So what are you going to do? l've been on the run for 6 years. lt's time to end this. l won't visit you again. (Won't it be better to switch him over?) (ln an unofficial route.) Like Tae-soon? (The spies are nuts over working for us) (after their funding ran dry.) (They will work for us for money) l already asked him to work with me. (Yeah? What did he say?) But he likes his work. (What? He. . .) Anyway, come relief me when you're done. (But. . .) Hello? (Sir, it's me.) Why didn't you show up yesterday? (The director's here.) - (l'll call you back.) - Hey! You're the one who called. ls he gone? (lt's Park Ki-joon, we met a couple of days ago.) Who? Park Ki-joon? Ah, Mr. Park! Park Ki-joon! Yes, sure. How can l help you? Ah, l see. Had lunch yet? Not yet. How about a burger? l don't like burgers. Anyway, you chose wisely. We have to push our strongest traits. Even the office workers look for a way out in their 40s. l haven't decided yet. l wanted to hear the conditions. l see. You must need a lot of money. Downpayment for an apartment. Apartment? How big? About 1 00m2. A self-made man, so young too. Apartment. . . That's our nation's problem. People become rich over it, families get broken up, but it also unites others, like us. How much will you pay me? l paid my old employees $2,000 total. . . But l can't give you that, it's hardly enough for you. $2,500? Add another 200? $3,000! Housing included! l'm sorry. . . l get that with my current job. Of course, but l'm not done yet. There's also incentives. How much will that be? Usually incentives are... 1 0%. 30%... No higher. When do l start? Right now. You don't need to bring gifts every time. Bro, it's Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is in 4 months. Who's he? Ki-joon, greet him. He's my new employee. Yeah? Where are you from? Why are you asking stuff like that? lt's Haenam, sir. Really? Where in Haenam? Why? Don't l look country? lt's not that, you don't have a dialect. Don't you know each other? No, it's not that. Bro, l have something to ask. Take a look. Boss, why are you following me? Right, right. Hey, please stop. You won't go far like this. You're gonna tire yourself out. - Run - No! No! One case completed. ls that absolutely necessary? What? The cuffs. Ma'am, l'm sorry. l'll uncuff you at home. Please uncuff her, this is torture. lf she escapes after we get her, she's gone for good. How can she escape while the car's running? Listen, Ki-joon. Do you have to make it unpleasant on our first day together? Did l beat her? Or curse at her? ls that any better than either? Listen to me. l have pride in my work just like you do. Why? l keep this nation's families together. We're not cops and they haven't committed any crimes. Please treat them like humans. Ki-joon. There's a dark side to our work. What we do will have positive effects. . . Bastard, an adult is talking. You could do that while we're moving! You... Come on in. You can stay here with me. lt's my office but comfortable enough to stay. Make yourself at home. Look at that. Side effect of living alone. l'll use the upstairs and you can use this space here. Please don't come up. lt just fell. lt's a kitchen knife! l must be nuts. All this for money. (Undercover report:) (NlS agent Lee Han-kyu) (lnfiltrated as an employee,) (lnternational Task Force) (Tracing Son Tae-soon's whereabouts) (Address - Seoul, Mapo-gu...) (Still not back?) l haven't slept a wink. (What if he figures it out) (and brings Shadow?) How could he know me? (But) Cut the crap, l'm hanging up. (You will be. . .) Where have you been? Come in. You have a guest too. Where is that commie! Where are the cuffs? Yesterday, Ji-won... Where were you? This? l was just testing it. Doesn't work well. Ki-joon, the key please. Just throw it. What do we do today? Yes, Mr. Jo. We'll call you when we find her. Yes. . . Haven't slept well? Should l drive? No, only l drive this car. That could've been nasty. We're here. You start from this side. And l'll cover this area. Come back here after a round. Rather than an aimless approach, you go diagonally like this. And l take the opposite route. lf not we flip 45 degrees and try again. We'll get her for sure. l know that method. Where did you learn it? Online. lt's an old trick. All right, let's give it a try. Yeah. (Any progress yet?) Progress? l might be paying him $3,000. $3,000?! That's just base pay. l had to lure him with 30% incentive too. . . What kind of communist is so fixated on money? (Where is he spending the money?) Says it's for an apartment, shit. All the while his boss is renting. He pretends to be noble and tells me l'm being inhumane. He doesn't answer anything properly. He's practically the boss around here! l gotta find a way soon. His salary's going to be bigger than... Find her? Goddamn commie. That's why l have to find my wife. Have you seen her? We don't know. Come on, play! Me? lt's my turn? This granny's hand is worthless. You could put your hand down and call it. No mercy when it comes to gambling. l found her. Who's the other one? They were together. They must've escaped with each other. How did you bring them? l convinced them. . . Humanely. l got the humane part, but how did you find them so fast? ls that a problem? No. Of course not. How old are you? 6 years old. 6? l don't know how to thank you. . . Normally $2,000 for finding, bringing back $2,000 for a total of $4,000. . . She wanted to come on her own, so it's okay. But if it wasn't for us. . . l must repay you, humanely. Of course, humanely. Very humane, indeed. What the hell?! Get it! Quickly! - l got it, - Got it? - got it! - Nice! Nice! Cuff it if we're bringing it home. Jesus Christ! Move that somewhere! lt's just food. Let's not start already. l don't want it, you eat it. Delicious. Genuine chicken broth. Been a while since someone cooked for me. What happened to your wife and daughter? l wasn't much of... a husband to her. This work can be demanding. She remarried a British man and moved to England. His name is Albert and renamed my daughter Amy. What kind of stupid name is Amy? Don't you want to see her? l haven't seen her once after they left. l want to buy her a home when she gets married. You will be able to. Of course, that's what l'll do. Be good to your wife when you get married. (NlS agent Lee Han-kyu Divorced and lives alone.) (Chicken broth) Okay! One more day! Are you going out? Go out and meet some people too. You're too young to be cooked up in here. Meet who? A friend or a girlfriend? No friends in Seoul. And not interested in girls. Then go have fun somewhere. Don't waste your vacation like this. l'll just watch some TV. Hello? Hi, Yoon-ji. Daddy's working. What are you doing? ls that so? Albert's teaching you piano? Must've been nice... Do you like your new dad? Like me better? Birthday present? Digital camera? You can buy that there. l'll send money so ask your mom for it. Daddy has to go, honey. (Could you cook something nice for me? Boss) Tae-soon! Over here! Thank you, as always. Let's all live well. Quite cozy. You sold your country and comrades so you can live like this?! l'm treated like a traitor and l can't go back because of you! You did this to me! Say something! l want to live. l want to live! Shit... l'm sorry. What about the family? Went to the in-laws for a few days. How did you know l was here? Didn't you meet an NlS agent earlier? No! l'm not part of that anymore. And Lee is not an agent anymore. What are you talking about? He took responsibilities for that botched operation and was fired. He doesn't work for them anymore. The director was asking about you. Me? What for? ls hell freezing over? He's up there for a long time. lt was hard getting it. lt's not even released yet. What? lt's no biggie triangulating a cell, don't make a fuss over a GPS tracker. This will work even when cells don't. l'll take it back if you don't like it. Forget that. Give me the receiver. No one knows, right? Yeah, okay. There's a new development. A big news? l think something's up in the North. Yeah? What's going on? Go watch the news. (7th undercover report) You're back? TV all day? Always the same music show. You trying to be a singer? (There is a breaking news.) (North Korea will carry out) (a nuclear missile test) (within a few days.) (For our proud nation,) (we have developed nuclear weapon.) (lt aims for self-defense) Why are those fuckers acting up again? (lt's been known that North Korea) (was developing nuclear arsenal.) (But this is the first official proof of its existence.) (This development) (will renew the tension between two nations.) (They claim that the weapons) (will not be used) (unless provoked by the US. . .) What the hell! What's with the suit? Going somewhere nice? Looks great. There's a soiree. A soiree? lt's reunion. l wanted to meet some old friends. What kind of school? Primary. Ah, elementary school. Really old friends then. Go on. l might be late. Have fun and don't drink too much. Kyung-nam! lt's time! He's going to a school reunion. So? Think, you moron! How could a guy from the North go to a South reunion? Shadow? l'll send photos of his associates and plate numbers so cross reference. - Keep driving! Go, go! - Keep driving! l got a report that he passed out at a bar. l put a tail on him. He doesn't normally drink. Something's up. Professor, producer, pastor A commie producer, no wonder this country's going to shit. Hello, l have some special scoop, could l talk to producer Min Kyu-chul? (He went to China on an assignment) (for a month.) Ah, on an assignment. l see. (What's the scoop?) l shoved it up your asshole. Professor and the producer left yesterday and only the pastor's still in the country. Why didn't you tell me earlier! Have they realized what we're up to? A pastor. l got you red bastards. - Head for Hwagok. - Yes, sir. Pastor Lee? - Please come in. - Thank you. You're all finished, rat fuckers! Who are you? Why are you doing this? We're Song Ji-won's friends. l live with him. Live together? Don't know Song Ji-won? How about Park Ki-joon. Ah, ln-joon! Are you referring to Jo ln-joon? ln-joon is our client. Ow, my arm... ln-joon has family in the North. Wife and a daughter, but he hasn't seen them in 7 years, l'm told. ln-joon was betrayed and abandoned by his own country. He can't surrender because of family back home even if he wanted to. He couldn't wait any longer so he wanted to bring his family, so he came to us. But it was more costly than he thought, and l didn't hear from him for a while. This past summer he came back, saying he can get the money. Apartment payment. Then? But before we could get them out, the nuclear incident happened. So naturally the border tightened up and became hard for us to infiltrate. Professor and the producer left to Northern. l think it would be the last chance Are you going to report Ji-won now? Wait a couple of day. He's bringing his family back. Won't he surrender then? Pretty, huh? l went to Vietnam and met 1 20 girls in an hour and she was the most beautiful one. lf a man's going to remarry, he must choose the beautiful one. Are you married? No. Young people these days think it's better to live alone but. . . What's your wife's name? EUNWENDDl DDOOl AN Or Won Soo-young in Korean. Beautiful but too smart. Making a fuss over some beatings. - There, please. - Thank you There you go He'll beat her if she comes back, right? Hey, mind you own business. His family is not your concern. Capitalism is about finding happiness by taking another's wealth. That's not a crime, okay? Do you find happiness in looking for other men's women? Watch your mouth! You don't know anything about me. lsn't that the same? Quit if you don't like it. Bitch and moan. - Over here. - Catch it. - Here. - Get the ball. Ddooi An? Miss Ddooi An? Mr. Jung asked us to find you. Please come with us. l'm not a Vietnamese, l'm half Korean! We already know. - Who are you? - Who? Aren't you all illegal? Should l get the immigration down here? Move! Out of the way! l said l'm a Korean! l love this country! Tihong! Call Tihong! Do something! Sure, you're a Korean, l have no doubt. l'm sure about that. Please stop! Do you see them only as money? Son of a bitch! Don't pretend to be humane. You need the money too! Remember the apartment? No wonder your family left you. What? What did you just say? You really want to start this? You bastard! What are you waiting for! Get out! Get out from the car... Did you see the news? Our team lost. You're all dead. l didn't see the match. Once in 10 years or so, huh? lt's because we didn't settle last time. - What do you think? - You? Can you manage? Go, you bastard! l said go! Are you okay? l'm not okay. Look at that traffic. An accident? Ah, it's Thanksgiving. Everyone's heading home. But look at us. Bruised and battered. You're lucky to be spending Thanksgiving with family. Did your husband beat you a lot? l can have Korean citizenship 2 years after wedding. But he won't sponsor me for it. Saying l'd leave him when l get it. Whenever l ask him about it he hits me. l have a favor. Could l see my sister on the way? She also married here. l haven't seen her in over 5 years. l beg of you. Newan! Sister, is this really you? - lt's great. - Great l through we'll never meet again How are you? Ki-joon! - Yeah? - Let's just go. Too bad about the payment. Eh, it's only a couple of bucks. Why did you let that boss go? When we get the reward, you're gonna leave. l'd hate to let you go once you have your apartment. You'll make me more money over time. Won't you Cheers! (ln the time we celebrate Thanksgiving) (North Korea) (is organizing behind our back) Thanksgiving is no big deal. (about the nuclear test location) (United Nations Security Council announced) (if North Korea is still unilateral) (continue to conduct nuclear tests) (United Nations would impose sanctions against them.) (Right now) (the government is actively convened think-tank) (Days of the meeting, to discuss the program) (to find a solution) (The national unity policy researcher Professor Zhao) (which is the focus of this meeting) How long have we worked together? About 4 months. That long already? Don't you miss your family? l'm divorced! What's the point in missing them? Family is family when we're together. Ki-joon, could you call me 'brother'? Forget it, why are you my brother? Come on, just once. Let's just pretend. No. Cocky prick. Fine, l don't like you either. You up? What are you doing? Fortunately the store was open. lt's late but you should put on a service for your parents. Why? Don't know how to do it? What's your mother's maiden name? Kim, An-dong district. An-dong Kim? l'll give it a try. l hear the North have services nowadays. Sit... Would l report you during a service? Did you know who l am? Did you know all along?! Answer me! Stop this, Ki-joon. No, you're Ji-won, Song Ji-won. Why did you keep me around? Why didn't you report me? You're a small fish. A spy ring would be a different story. l found out that you were abandoned by your organization. So, now you want to sell me off. How much will they pay you? Lower the knife. Who knows what'll happen. lf everything goes well, we could just continue our business. What will we do with our skills? We could make it big if we cooperate. Then we hike up the fees and make some serious dough. And we'll help people too. Go on, l'll give your parents a bow too. Go on. Hello? Oh, Kyung-nam. What? Son-tae? Where are you? Yeah. . . yeah, okay. l have to go out. Something happened to a friend. Looks like the job of Shadow. lt must be him. l want to live. l want to live! lt's Song Ji-won! Ji-won, do you remember me? We met briefly 6 years ago. Lee told me all about you. l know about your situation. Shadow is active again. We just want to find him. We can protect your secrecy. Do you see me. . . as a spineless traitor? Catch him! Don't let him get away! Catch up to him! Kyung-nam, let him go! Sir, what are you saying?! You know Shadow has abandoned him. He has nothing to do with this. What were you saying? But he may still be a link to Shadow. Please, give him 2 days. When his family comes over, he'll surrender. How could we catch spies with mercy and compassion? You're putting me in an awkward position. Hey, Lee Han-kyu! Please stop the car. Hand over the GPS, and tell me about Ji-won. We'll pay you handsomely. Still same as always. What are you going to do with him? He's blacklisted by Shadow. Would he still contact him? So incompetent... l'm asking for the GPS so that you don't get involved in this. l could have you thrown in jail if you don't comply. Times have changed, you can't just threaten a civilian. Money? Perhaps a million? Stop crediting yourself for others' work. Nothing's changed around here! Hey! Hey! Get back in here! There's no room for mistake. Shoot to kill if you have to. (You have reached the mail-box) Ji-won, pick up the phone! There's a GPS tracker in your watch. They know where you are. So throw out your watch. What's his position? He's at the bus terminal. He's on his cell phone. (Producer Min, it's ln-joon.) (Yes, ln-joon.) l called you because this may be the last time. (ln-joon, what are you saying?) l may have caused harm to my family. So. . . please continue the work even without me. l'm hanging up now. We're exposed. Take out the exposed agents and track him until he makes contact with Shadow. (You have reached the mail-box) Current position, Jongro. Jongro? Who's there? Our country is giving you a last chance. Prove yourself. l can already feel the bloodbath. (The purpose of this conference. . .) Contact the local district authorities! What's going on? l don't know, we just received an order. lt's probably nothing. He has a gun! Block him! Coming to you, behind the blue car. What? - lt's fine now. - Why is that? He's within 40m. - Spread out! - Yes, Sir. What are you waiting for? Finish the job. Ji-won! Song Ji-won! What happened? What about Shadow? Anyway, l'm glad you're okay. There's no time, give me your watch. GPS tracker is in here. Why didn't you answer the phone? NlS knows your position, they'll swarm the area soon. They might kill you, so get out of here. Professor, are you all right? Get out of here. What's wrong? The actions stopped in the Northern area. Did the party send you? What is he saying? Fucking traitor. Talks too goddamn much. lt wasn't an order from above? What? Mind your own business. Did you kill Tae-soon on your own? Killing traitors is a privileged job for our nation. You're one of them now. l'm not a traitor. Didn't you try to defect your family? What happened to my family? What do you think? What happened to them?! Ji-won, you dumb idiot. l lost my colleagues, job and my family because of you. lf you don't drop the gun, he'll die. Go ahead. Kill me! - Stop it, Ji-won. - Bastard! Over here! - Call the HQ! - Yes, sir! - Jin-woo, go down. - Okay. - Step back! Request backup! - Watch out! We go down together. Ji-won! No, Shadow is still alive! - What about Ji-won? - We couldn't verify. He's still alive! Still alive! No... Hang it there. Let me go. No... Romantic bastards. . . He's dead. Cancel backup and call paramedics. Are you okay? Ji-won, wake up! l... didn't... betray anyone. . . l know. Wake up! Hurry up! Congratulations... l know you could have made it. What are you doing? Call me if you got fired. (No. 1 00, Evergreen House, Jiangnan Road, Seoul) (Mr. Ll) Brother! l've recovered well and doing all right. lsn't it Yoon-ji's birthday soon? Go see her for a change. Don't just stay home and wonder. Perhaps it's time for me to leave for somewhere familiar. l don't think l belong here either. lf l want to buy a house here, l need to save money like you do. When l come back, we shall meet again. This is called PMP. Pictures, movies and even internet. My daughter begged me for it. l'm sure your daughter will love it. Anyway, take care of things while l'm away. Yes boss, have a good flight! This is lnternational Task Force. - Miss... - Yes, sir. ls it open bar in business class? That's right. l could bring you one if you like. Then can you get me the most expensive whiskey on the rocks? l'll prepare it right away. Only village idiot drinks whiskey before the take off. How could someone who only eats burgers know the difference between good and shit? Right? Ripped by HighCode
