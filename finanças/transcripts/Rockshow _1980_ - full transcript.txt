Listen, this is Denny Laine. Evening, all. This next song is a song you might know. It's called "Spirits of Ancient Egypt." [MUSIC - "SPIRITS OF ANCIENT EGYPT"] You're my baby and I love you. You can take a pound of love and cook it in the stew. When you're finished doing that, I know what you'll want to do. 'Cause you're my baby and I love you. I'm your baby. Do you love me? I can drive a Cadillac across the Irish sea. When I've finished doing that, I know where I want to be. 'Cause I'm your baby and you love me. Spirits of ancient Egypt. Shadows of ancient Rome. Spirits of ancient Egypt. Hung on the telly. Hung on the telly. Hung on the telephone. Oh, 'cause your my baby, I know you know you could sell an elevator to Geronimo. When you're finished doing that, I know where you'll want to go. 'Cause you're my baby and you love me. Spirits of ancient Egypt. Echoes of sunken Spain. Spirits of ancient Egypt. Hung on the phone a-- hung on the phone a-- hung on the phone again. Spirits of ancient Egypt. Oh. [crowd cheering] Thank you. Thank you very much. Well we'll stick with the shovel-- shuffle rhythm, I should say. The shovel rhythm. This here is Jimmy McCulloch. Yeah. Do another one from the "Venus and Mars" album. This one is called "Medicine Jar." [music - "medicine jar"] What's wrong with you? I wish I knew. You say time will tell. I hope that's true. There's more to life than blues and reds. I say, I know how you fell now your friends are dead. Dead on your feet, you won't get far if you keep on sticking your hand in the medicine jar. Well now don't give up, whatever you do. You say time will tell. I hope that's true. If you go down and lose your head, I say, I know how you fell now your friends are dead. Dead on your feet, you won't get far if you keep on sticking your hand in the medicine jar. Dead on your feet, you won't get far if you keep on sticking your hand in the medicine jar. What can I do? I can't let go. You say time will heal, but very slow. So don't forget the things you said. I say I know how you feel now your friends are dead. Dead on your feet, you won't get far if you keep on sticking your hand in the medicine jar. Dead on your feet, you won't get far if you keep on sticking your hand in the medicine jar. The medicine jar. The medicine jar. The medicine jar. Get your hand out. [crowd cheering] Great. Thanks a lot. We're going to change around here. Denny's going to play a bit of bass. We're going to do a piano tune. It goes back a few albums, but I'm sure you know it. [music - "maybe i'm amazed"] Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time. Maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you. Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time. You hung me on a line. Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you. Maybe I'm a man and maybe I'm a lonely man who's in the middle of something that he doesn't really understand. Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me. Darling, won't you help me to understand? Ooh. Ah. Maybe I'm a man and maybe I'm a lonely man who's in the middle of something that he doesn't really understand. Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman who's able to help me. Baby, won't you help me to understand? Ooh. Ah. Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time. Maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you. Maybe I'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song. You right me when I'm wrong. Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. Now baby, won't you help me understand? Ooh. Ah.

[crowd cheering] Thank you. Thank you. Cheers. Thank you very much. Thanks a lot, folks. We'd like to play a tune now which we recorded in New Orleans, Louisiana. And this song is called "Call Me Back Again." [music - "call me back again"] Well, when I-- when I was just a little baby boy, every night I would call because your number brought me joy. Ooh, I've called your house every night since then, but I ain't never, no, no, never heard you calling me. Come on and call me. Call me back again. Tell me, baby, why won't you call me? Call me back again. Oh yeah. Ooh, I've called your house every night since then, but I ain't never, no, no, never heard you calling me. So come on, won't you call? Call me back again. Every night I've been calling your name. Call me back again. So come one and call me back again. Well when I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-- when I was just a little baby boy, every night, every night, I would call because your number, you know it brought me such great joy. Ooh, I've called your name, child, every night since then. But I ain't never no, no, no, no, no, no, no, never heard you, ain't never heard you calling me, my sweet, sweet baby. Call me back again. So you know you-- you better call me back again. Woo. Call me back again. I call the operator, call the operator. Call me back again. But I still can't get through to you. Call me back again. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ooh babe. Ooh babe. Ooh babe. You've got me crying, babe. Come on and call me back again. Got me running. [crowd cheering] Hey. Well you're a grand bunch here tonight. I'll tell you that. I'll tell you a lot for nothing. Listen, before we go any further, have we got any English people in the audience? All right. Have we got any people from Canada? How about Americans? Yeah. All right. We'd like to do a tune now which goes back into the mists of time. And if anyone feels like clapping along with this one-- when it starts though, you know. It goes like this. That wasn't it. Ooh. All right. Woo. [music - "lady madonna"] Lady Madonna, children at your feet. Wonder how you manage to make ends meet. Who finds the money? When you pay the rent? Did you know that money was Heaven sent? Friday night arrives without a suitcase. Sunday morning creep in like a nun. Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace. See how they run. Lady Madonna, baby at your breast. Wonder how you manage to feed the rest. See how they run. Lady Madonna, lying on the bed. Listen to the music playing in your head. Come on, baby. Tuesday afternoon is never ending. Wednesday morning papers didn't come. Thursday night you stockings needed mending. See how they run. Lady Madonna, children at your feet. Wonder how you manage to make ends meet. Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa, yeah. [crowd cheering] Oh. Oh, sugar. [crowd cheering] Thank you. [MUSIC - "THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD"] The long and winding road that leads to your door will never disappear. I've seen that road before. Don't leave me standing here. Lead me to your door. The wild and windy night that the rain washed away has left a pool of tears crying for the day. Don't keep me waiting here. Let me know the way. Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried. Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried. But still they lead me back to the long and winding road. You left me standing here a long, long time ago. Oh yeah. Don't keep me standing here. Lead me to your door. But still they lead me back to the long and winding road. You left me standing here a long, long time ago. Ooh yeah. Oh yeah. Don't keep me waiting here. Don't keep me waiting. Lead me to your door. Ooh. [crowd cheering] Woo. Thank you. Listen, I'd like to hand you over now for a few words from my friend, missus, and better half Linda. Thank you very much. This next song is about a British secret agent and it's full of intrigue intrigue. Woo-hoo. It's called "Live and Let Die." [music - "live and let die"] When you were young and your heart was an open book, you used to say live and let live. You know you did, you know you did, you know you did. But if this ever changing world in which we live in makes you give in and cry, say live and let die. Live and let die. Live and let die. Live and let die. What does it matter to you? When you've got a job to do, you've got to do it well. You've got to give the other fellow hell. You used to say live and let live. You know you did, you know you did, you know you did. If this ever changing world in which we live in makes you give in and cry, say live and let die. Live and let die. Live and let die. Let it die. Live and let die. [crowd cheering] This is where we have a little sit down now and play our acoustic guitars for a while. So take your socks off if you like. Uh, not if you're sitting down in the front. Don't. This is a wee drinking song from "Band on the Run" here. [MUSIC - "PICASSO'S LAST WORDS (DRINK TO ME)"] A grand old painter died last night, his paintings on the wall. Before he went, he bade us well and said goodnight to us all. Drink to me, drink to my health. You know I can't drink anymore. Drink to me, drink to my health. You know I can't drink anymore. 3 o'clock in the morning, I'm getting ready for bed. It came without a warning, but I'll be waiting for you, baby. I'll be waiting for you there. So drink to me, drink to my health. You know I can't drink anymore. Drink to me, drink to my health. You know I can't drink anymore. [speaking french] [music - "richard cory"] They say that Richard Cory owns one half of this whole town. With political connections, he spreads his wealth around. He was born into society, a banker's only child. He had everything a man could want-- money, praise, and style. The papers print his picture almost every place he goes. Richard Cory at the opera, Richard Cory at the shows. And the rumor of his parties and the orgies on his yacht. He really must be happy with everything he's got. But I work at his factory and I curse the life I'm living, and I curse my poverty. Oh, I wish that I could be-- I wish that I could be-- I wish that I could be Richard Cory. Yeah. He really gave to the charities in town. He had the common touch. And they were thankful for his patronage so they thanked him very much. My mind was filled with wonder when the evening headline read, Richard Cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head. But I work in his factory and I curse the life I'm living, and I curse my poverty. I wish that I could be-- yeah, yeah, yeah. I wish that I could be-- Oh I wish that I could be Richard Cory. Or Paul Simon, whichever suits you the best. [crowd cheering] Thank you. Thank you, Dennis. Uh, does anyone know what a rhythm box is? Hands up. OK. Um, listen, for anyone who doesn't know what a rhythm box is, it's this little thing you can get in a shop, you plug it in your wall and you hit the button and it sounds like that. [inaudible]. Amazing what we can do these days, you know. Isn't it? [music - "bluebird"] Late at night when the wind is still, I'll come flying through your door, and you'll know what love is for. I'm a bluebird. I'm a bluebird. I'm a bluebird. I'm a bluebird. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a bluebird. I'm a bluebird. I'm a bluebird. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Touch your lips with a magic kiss, and you'll be a bluebird too, and you'll know what love can do. I'm a bluebird. I'm a bluebird. I'm a bluebird. I'm a bluebird. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a bluebird. I'm a bluebird. I'm a bluebird. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah bluebird, ah-ha. Bluebird, ah-ha. Bluebird, ah-ah-ah. Fly away through the midnight air as we head across the sea, and at last we will be free. You're a bluebird. You're a bluebird. You're a bluebird. You're a bluebird. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're a bluebird. You're a bluebird. You're a bluebird. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah bluebird, ah-ha. Bluebird, ah-ha. Bluebird, ah-ah-ah. Howie Casey. At last we will be free. Bluebirds, you and me. At last we will be free. Oh now, bluebird, ah-ha. Bluebird, ah-ha. Bluebird, ah-ah-ah. All alone on a desert island, we're living in the trees, and we're flying in the breeze. We're the bluebirds. We're the bluebirds. We're the bluebirds. We're the bluebirds. And we're singing bluebirds, ah-ha. Bluebird, ah-ha. Bluebird, ah-ah-ah. Ooh. [crowd cheering] Muchas gracias. OK, listen. We'd like to do a tune now which is a-- well it's known in the business as a slight toe tapper. You know them. You know. So listen, if anyone feels like tapping their toes, do it to this one. It's going back a bit, this, but uh, if you're over 12, you're all right. [MUSIC - "I'VE JUST SEEN A FACE"] I've just seen a face. I can't forget the time or place we first met. She's just the girl for me and I want all the world to see we've met. La la la la-ah la. Had it been another day, I might have looked the other way and I'd have never been aware. But as it is, I'll dream of her tonight. La la la da-da da. Falling, yes I am falling, and she keeps calling me back again. Falling, yes I am falling, and she keeps calling me back again. Take it, boy. Falling, yes I am falling, and she keeps calling me back again. Falling, yes I am falling, and she keeps calling me back again. I have never known the likes of this. I've been alone and I have missed things and kept out of sight, but other girls were never quite like this. La la la da-da da. Falling, yes I am falling, and she keeps calling me back again. Falling, yes I am falling, and she keeps calling me back again. [crowd cheering] Thank you. I'd like to change over to my other piano, as Winifred Atwell once said. [music - "blackbird"] Blackbird singing in the dead of night. Take these broken wings and learn to fly. Mm. All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise. Blackbird singing in the dead of night. Take these sunken eyes and learn to see. Mm. All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to be free. Blackbird fly. Blackbird fly into the light of the dark black night. Blackbird singing in the dead of night. Take these broken wings and learn to fly. Mm. All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise. Blackbird fly. Blackbird fly into the light of the dark black night. Blackbird singing in the dead of night. Take these sunken eyes and learn to see. Mm. All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to be free. You were only waiting for this moment to be free. You were only waiting for this moment to be free. [crowd cheering] Thanks a lot. This one will take you back a bit, if you remember it. See how you go. [music - "yesterday"] Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they're here to stay. Oh, I believe in yesterday. Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be. There's a shadow hanging over me. Oh, yesterday came suddenly. Why she had to go, I don't know. She wouldn't say. I said something wrong now I long for yesterday. Yesterday love was such an easy game to play. Now I need a place to hide away. Oh, I believe in yesterday. Mm mm mm mm mm mm-mm. [crowd cheering] Thank you. Thank you! We'd like to dedicate this next tine we're going to play to, uh, Fred Astaire. It goes like this. [MUSIC - "YOU GAVE ME THE ANSWER"] You gave me the answer to love eternally. I love you and you, you seem to like me. Wherever we wander, the local folk agree. I love you and you, you seem to like me. Heading back for old familiar places, places where the cobwebs blow away. I can forget the airs and graces. Should do this more often, chaps. This is fun. You'll never be crowned by the aristocracy. To their delight, you'd merely invite them in for a cup of tea. I love you and you, you seem to like-- you seem to like-- you seem to like me. Ooh. [crowd cheering] Thank you. This next song is a bit of a rocker. In fact, it's a lot of a rocker. And it's about three comic book-- strip cartoon characters. Here they come. Come on, lads. Get down here! The song is called "Magneto and Titanium Man." [MUSIC - "MAGNETO AND TITANIUM MAN"] Well I was talking last night. Magneto and Titanium Man. We were talking about you, baby. You were involved in a robbery that was due to happen at a quarter to 3 in the main street. Well I didn't believe them. I didn't believe them. Magneto and Titanium Man. But when the Crimson Dynamo finally assured me, I knew you were involved in a robbery that was due to happen at a quarter to 3 in the main street. So we went out. Magneto and Titanium Man. And the Crimson Dynamo came along for the ride. We went to town with the library and we swung all over that long, tall bank in the main street. Well there she were and to my despair, she's a five-star criminal breaking the code. Magneto said, "Now the time has come to gather our forces and run." Oh no. Can't be so. Then it occurred to me. You couldn't be bad. Magneto was mad. Titanium too. And the Crimson Dynamo just couldn't cut it no more. You were the law. Ah yeah. We went to town with the library and we swung all over that long, tall bank in the main street. You know what I mean? Well there she were and to my despair, she's a five-star criminal breaking the code. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Magneto said, "Now the time has come to gather our forces and run." Oh no. Can't be so. Then it occurred to me. You couldn't be bad. Magneto was mad. Titanium too. And the Crimson Dynamo, well he just couldn't cut it no more. You were the law. [crowd cheering] My, my, my. I'd like to do a flash from the past for whoever knows it out there. We've already said-- [music - "go now"] --goodbye. But since you've got to go, oh you'd better go now, go now, go now, go now before you see me crying. Yeah, yeah. I don't want you to tell me what you intend to do now. Yeah. How many times do I have to tell you, darling, I'm still in love with you now. Whoa, oh, oh, oh. We've already said so long. I don't want to see you go. Oh you'd better go now, go now, go now, go now. Don't you even try, yeah, telling me that you really want to us to end this way. Yeah. How many times do I have to tell you, darling, I want you to stay? Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know that I want you to stay. I want you to stay. Since you've got to go, oh you'd better go now, go now, go now, go now. Don't you even cry, yeah. Well I don't want you to tell me what you intend to do now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How many times do I have to tell you, darling, I'm still in love with you now. Whoa, oh, oh, oh. I don't want to see you go. But darling, you'd better go now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. [crowd cheering] That was for all the over 12s. OK. While we're still on the subject of loving and leaving, this one's for the lovers amongst you. [music - "my love"] And when I go away, I know my heart can stay with my love. It's understood, it's in the hands of my love and my love does it good. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. My love does it good. When the cupboard's bare, I'll still find something there with my love. It's understood, it's everywhere with my love and my love does it good. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. My love does it good. Oh, I love, oh, my love. Only my love holds the other key to me. Oh, my love, oh, my love. Only my love does it good to me. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. My love does it good. Don't ever ask me why I never say goodbye to my love. It's understood, it's in the hands of my love and my love, she does it good. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. My love does it good. Oh, I love, oh, my love. Only my love does it good to me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

He's in love and he says love is fine. Oh. Oh. Oh, yes indeed we know that people will find a way to go no matter what the man said. And love is fine for all we know.

The tune we're going to play now is, um-- no, it's not that one. And it is called "Silly Love Songs." [music - "silly love songs"] You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs.
