Stop! Stop! Whom do you wanna meet? I don't know. What's the flat no? I don't know. How come you are not aware of anything? Now leave. A girl named Anvaya had been into these apartments 10 min ago. Could you let me know which flat she has been to? I'm not supposed to reveal such details sir. Please take this. This is really important for me. Please keep this and tell me the flat no. Ummm. Anvaya, B-Block 101, personal. She couldn't find 30min for me, yet she manages hours and hours spending here daily. Now go inside. I don't need it... Anvaya! Girl who proposed me three days ago. Love is supposed to be understanding and trusting each other but I neither know why is coming here nor what is she doing inside. I'm hurting with agony and unbearable anger. It has been six months Anvaya came into my life. Mom, please don't cry. Calm down. Everything's gonna be alright. Have food on time once you there. I'll be fine. Please stop crying. I hope you've all your colleague's contacts. Don't hesitate to ring me if you need any money. Please call me, if you need anything. Moreover, why would I need money there? Forgot to mention, I already have installed all the necessary apps on your mobile. Check this app, if you need any medicine. Aah. Okay. - They'll deliver them to home. - Yah. Okay. Book cabs on this app, in case if you want to go out. Ooo. If you need any house keeping assistance, use urban club. Is that fine? Yeah, You take care. Calm down. I don't feel like leaving them here like this. Come On! Flying to US is your dream. Now you stop worrying about Auntie & Uncle. We'll take care of them. You can leave them to us happily. Please do visit them every now & them. Just for two weeks till everything fall back. I'm entrusting everything on to you. Don't be melodramatic. They are my responsibility, now you've a safe and happy journey. Byee. I neither worry about him nor think about you anymore. I don't have time for all this nuisance. I'm not surprised. How'd you find leisure time for these when you spend 24hrs at clubs. You mean that I'm wasting all your money by partying at clubs? Yes, that's what I intend. I lost all my business and in fact my life because of you. Don't blame for your in cap a. Where were you? You know what time it is? I was at Airport, giving a send-off to Rakesh. Shame on you. It's been a year since you completed engineering, all your friends are going abroad for jobs. - Look at you, standing here and roaming with other jobless guys. - Stop it, Mohan. He isn't kid anymore. Don't talk to him like that. What else you want me to do? Don't irritate him with your nonsense. Let him be. You're jobless all these years and how come you expect him to listen to you. Don't cross your limits. Shut your mouth. What if I don't? I'll break your teeth. All the best for that. Yeah Varun tell me? Take this. I asked you for coffee. We ran out of coffee powder. I'll get it on my way back from office. What's that? Ll. No one even cares to water those plants in this house. How arrogant? Uncle, what happened? We couldn't sleep and were talking about him all night. Suddenly, she fainted in the hallway.. Rakesh he's calling for the fourth time. It'll worry him if he comes to know about this. He'll be even more worried if you don't answer. Hello, Pappa. Why aren't you picking my call? Rakesh. It's not your dad. Varun! What are you doing there? It was tad late last night, so I stayed back. That's so nice. Actually, Auntie is in middle of pooja. Uncle went out for walk, left his phone for charging. Are they still worrying about me? No, they look pretty normal and relaxed. I'm so relieved now. All because of you. Just chill pal. I'll make them call you back in sometime. No, that's okay. I'll call them as soon as I reach. It's getting late for me. Bye Varun. Okay ya. Bye. Thank you Varun. It's okay Uncle. Phone... Okay... Patient in room no. 105 is scheduled to discharge today get very thing ready. Nothing to worry. Reports look normal and you can take her home by evening. Generally, parents tend to get tensed and worried when their children leave abroad. It leads to BP fluctuations, loosing consciousness. We've seen cardiac arrests as well in some cases. Situation of most of the parents is nothing different these days. Have food on time once you there. I don't feel like leaving them here like this.

Check this app, if you need any medicine. In case if you want to go out. Ooo. If you need any house keeping assistance, use urban club. Hey Varun, what a great timing. I too came up with a great idea. Keep it aside. Focus on match. 4 runs in 1 ball. God! Please! Varun, you were talking about some idea. What was that? Many of us are going abroad in the name of higher education and jobs, leaving their parents behind helpless. How about we become their helping hand? Interesting. Isn't it? We've boost up the confidence of NRIs. Yaah.. They should feel safe and secured leaving their parents with us. We shall provide A to Z services. What sort of services you're talking about? You mean running a charity without taking any money. No, it won't function like that. We'll create an annual membership. We'll take them to hospitals in case of emergency. We'll also provide security to them. You're right Varun. One of my neighbour's son went abroad, I see all their struggles being old. Even my cousin's parents are going through all these. First things first, let's create a website and design an app as well. What shall we name our company? How does 'Mango Services' sound? It's no better than your face. We aren't selling mangoes here. Let's think something unique. Yes. Unique?!!! Mango services. Sounds unique. would be our app. Nice right.. What does it mean? Anvaya. It means positivity. It is a confidence we give to others that we can achieve anything. Google says something like family. That's what it is. We replace families. Exactly! Shall we start working then? We'll start from tomorrow. Let's do it. Let's rock. Super.. Take these sweets uncle. I was in business for almost 10 years and was bankrupted. Why don't you find a good job instead of business and all. Hai sir.. My name is Varun.. Just dial the number I've given whenever you need us. - Okay. - Thank you. Cheerssss.. Thank you so much guys 100 members joined our company within 10 days. Come on Varun. Not fruit punch again. Have some Breezer at least. I'm good Pooja. You all need someone like me to take you once everyone passes out. You'll never change. Where is Mango? He must have found a girl on the way. You're correct. I found one but haven't stopped for anyone. I don't believe it. Pooja, how many you had? It's my third. Third already? Waiter, Waiter! It's for me.. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me? Yeah. No matter what! We shouldn't stop until morning. Mix it with something or else you'll die sooner or later. Varun, can you come here once? - Why? - Come, I'll tell you. I'll come back. Wait. What's the matter? Do you remember Miyapur Sudhakar, one of our members. It seems to be power cut from last one hour. That area appears to be thief prone and police aren't responding either. So, they asked us for assistance. None of our staff would be available at this time. Even we all are drunk, shall we send Mango.? He didn't start yet. Mango, hold on a bit. What is it now? You're boss of this company after me. This is very cheap to your status. I'll throw a huge party for you. Night life. Night life? Will we both be accompanied by girls? Everyone else are girls except we both. Wait, let me handle this. Okay folks, you all have a great party. We both must take care of some important work. So, we're leaving now.Bubyeee. Bye. He's such a stupid. You lied to me about night life, girls and massage. You cheater, liar. However he is our member, Hands up... I know you are thieves. You're done.. I'll shoot both of you. What is this sir? Damn! These are police not thieves. I called them for help. Yes sir, I'm CI and he is constable. Stop irritating them, you come in Varun. You please wait here CI sir. He'll forget everything. He doesn't even remember the stuff happened this morning. Tell me the truth, who are you? Sir.. Please sir. Varun! Save me from him. Don't hesitate uncle, shoot him. It's surprising that you're still alive. How could you say him to shoot me? What are you eating? Snacks, want to have some? No need, I want your bike now. Why? Nothing! Its just been parked in front of gate. I was told to move it aside so... Take & come back soon. Varun you better die here, I'm escaping out of here. Hey Mango... Wait. Thank god! We got power back. Did you scared the child? No! I'll take a leave auntie. How can you go? You don't have your bike as well. Its okay auntie. I'll find an auto or cab. You don't find any of those at this night. Why don't you sleep here? He will torture you as well if we stay here. I'll take him to his room. You can use that room. I don't think it's a good idea. It's not safe to allow a stranger to sleep here. Auntie. Who is he? He will feel bad if he listens. We know him and he is not a stranger. Varun if you need anything please get them from kitchen. Okay Okay! Aunty. Hey! Who are you? Anvaya! Wait a minute. "Being attractive to each other" "Being attractive to each other" "Your beauty is mesmirising" Who are you? Where are my Mom and Dad? They slept already. Oh Hii Varun.. So it's you and you know what me & your company share same name, Anvaya. Its really nice to meet you, Anvaya. Nice to meet you. I was just telling go away..

Varun! What do you want? What are you looking at without even blinking your eyes? When did you find our visiting card so interesting? Not sure everything feels new and interesting. I see Anvaya even in dreams. You're thinking about our company even in dreams. You are a hybrid founder. Hey! Are we taking any feedback from our customer? Yah! We received a very good rating. Is it? I'll also take feedback from our new customer from Miyapur. Nothing Aunty, just wanted to check if everything is okay. Just a minute Varun, dear please check if the cab has arrived? Let me go & Check. You were asking for something Varun? We should go fast. Bank will be closed. Don't know if the cashier will be available or not. Driver lets go. You know which bank to go. Let's go! OMG! OMG! Is everything okay aunty? I'm facing a lot of problems because of his subconscious memory. He went leaving me alone. I have to draw a huge amount now and I'm worried about that.

How come you arrived suddenly? Car left us already. Now give a grand smile. Stupid! Hold these. Akash Hello! - Akash how are you? - Im good mom. How is sandhya? She is good too.. How is Anvaya? She slept off. I'm not sure but she looks dull from the day she has arrived. It could be jet lag. Its not jet lag. She broke up with a guy here. Speak to her and ask her to come out of it. Take care of her Mom. Let me talk to her. You too take care. Okay Mom. How is dad doing? He is good. Let me talk about it and you do not worry. Okay Mom. Okay Akash Bye. Why did you tell all this to them? This could be worrying to her. Its for her betterment only. Did you get to see kangaroos in Australia? I studied in US. Yah Yah US right. Have you completed medicine? I was doing MBA. You left the tap flowing in the bathroom. Yeah I forgot, let me go and turn it off. You haven't had anything since morning? Drink this juice at least. I don't want anything. Do not irritate me. Why are you so much irritated? Breakup doesn't mean just leaving a person but also you need to come out of his thoughts as well. How do you know? Akash told me everything. He is so annoying. What's over is over. How long you plan to sit like this. You have to move on... You don't understand. So please leave me alone. You were doing better back in US. You don't seem happy at all after coming here. You are neither happy nor we seeing you like this since you came here. I will go back if you feel so uncomfortable. You are so annoying... I thought you might feel refreshed if we spend some time out. Its up to you. Hai jahnavi. Yeah Anvaya. Shall we go out. I'm out of town, will be back in 2 days. Okay bye. Bye. Everyone is leaving, why don't we just go out and have some fun? You go ahead and you know that I don't like to roam outside. Hey, it's brother calling. Pickup, speak to him. Hello. Hey Varun. Hai. Are you busy? Not at all... Done with office so I'm free now. I want to go out. Will you accompany me? I'll be there in 5 minutes. What was it about? Anvaya asked me to take her out. You know right how much I like to go out? Spill it Nasty! Hai.. Hi! You haven't come out for the last 3 days. Its long distance travel and I was in jetlag, so just wanted to go outside. Please sit. Am I troubling you? Nothing at all. Where do you want to go? Kokapet. Kokapet! Okay... - I will be back in a moment. - Sure..sure. Shall we go? Yeah, yeah. Sure! Please.. Okay? Yeah!

Hi Bro. Why did you call me at this time? Alex is trying to reach me continuously. Haven't you broke up with him? Yes I did, but still he is torturing me. Tell him not to call me again & again. Isn't he shameless to call me so many times after breaking up? Such a jerk he is. I thought he cared and loved me but he never trusted me and was so possessive. I did a big mistake by loving him. Don't get tensed, Let me handle him. Okay sorry to disturb you. It's okay. Milkshake. No! Shall we go? Yeah! Why did we come here? Please get down. I'll tell you. Whenever I feel low or have a bad day, I come here and eat 'Dil Pasand'. Not because of its taste but of because its name. Come! - Actually, whenever I'm upset. - Your order sir. Lakshmi Narasimha Gaaru. That's not my name sir. Then? Don't you know my name? So, you don't know me. You must be kidding. Haven't you heard of Bakery Balu? Bakery? Bakery Balu. TikTok Superstar... How come you haven't heard of me. If you had come in the morning, you could have witnessed my stardom. People wait for hours in line just to take a selfie with me. Sorry Bakery Balu Gaaru. Can you get us two Dil Pasand, please? No, I don't. But why? Bakery Balu gaaru, give me two Dil Pasand. Please don't let me down in front of a girl. I'm not taking your order and that's final. I'll do whatever you want me to do. But please. Are you sure right? Yesss!!! In that case, let's make two TikTok videos together then I'll give you two Dil Pasand. You're not kidding, right? Yes - Do you really want me to do this? - Yes. Thank you. Thank you so much. Please have your seat. I'll get your Dil Pasands in two minutes. God. He might screw us if we stay here for one more minute. - Come let's go. - What? Come let's go. OMG! I will never come here to eat Dil Pasand if I'm upset. Yeah, If I ever feel low, I can just watch those tiktok videos. Shall we go? ♪ You won my heart without my consent ♪ You grabbed my whole attention. You made me follow you blindly.

What are you doing? How dare you? Don't touch me. Idiot. Come let's go! Why all these fights? Cab has arrived, let's go. How could they behave so impolitely at public places with women...? Rascals. You've given them a fitting reply in your style. He'd never dare to touch a girl again. - Take care. - You too. - Bye. - Bye. Call me once you reach home. - Good Night. - Good Night. Take a right here. Now take left. I heard your dear husband was shouting again. What was that for now? God knows. Just wait for 1 more year. You can be free from all these. What is going to happen in a year? He'll be busy playing with his grandkids. At least try to find a girl for. Found one already. Really? Who's she? She came to our home as well. Anvaya? I like her very much. I'm planning to propose her as well. Don't be surprised if it is accepted. Good choice. Inform to your Dad as well so that we can go and talk to her parents. I just felt like sharing it with you not with everyone. Varun wait. We got you finally. Open the door. Come! Leave me. Will you tease a girl? Thank you Varun... Thank you so much... You're welcome... Actually, you did a good job. Sharing live location on WhatsApp. Too smart. Girls can't survive without smart thinking and self-defence these days. Wouldn't it be even more interesting if a guy like me become your boy friend. What? Come again. I mean it would be more interesting if you've a friend like me. Yah. Yah. Yah. Actually Anvaya, I'm dying to tell you something from quite a few days. Can I be your boyfriend? What? Yeah Anvaya, I really love you. Actually, I fell for you when we first met on Skype. How do I tell it? You came like a magic into my life. Coincidentally, I named my company as Anvaya too. I'm afraid that I might lose you when I see your parents trying to find a guy for you. You're really really important to my life. I love you so much Anvaya. I'd like to marry you, if you're interested. Not a bad idea. What? I don't think it'll stop raining. I'll go by metro. I'll drop you at home. No that's okay. I can go. Okay Bye. Anvayaaa. Not a bad idea. That means.. Not a bad idea. Suppose if I propose a girl. How'd she react if she likes it? She'll say “ Same to you ”. If she doesn't like it...? She'll scold you and she might complain to her brother or father if you trouble her. What do you think? Why did she leave without saying a 'YES' or 'NO'? It is really challenging to decipher a girl's brain. If it's not a bad idea then it must be a good idea. It's true! Did you understand now? Varun, it's Anvaya. Give my phone back. I'll kill you all if you don't hand it back to me. Hello Anvaya. Just a second. Hello! Are you ok? Nothing nothing! We're just playing a game for fun. I should go to the chair crawling like this. What are you doing? Hey.. Anvaya asked me to come home. Did she accept your proposal? She didn't say anything about that. Her mother might have given birth while watching a suspense thriller movie. That's why she's like this. You go. If something goes wrong just give me a ring. I'll come with our batch. Try to be optimistic. May be no one's at her home. You should go and check that out. That's a very good idea. Come in Sit here, I'll be back in 2 minutes. Your coffee. Thank you. Coffee tastes really good. Thank you. Where is Aunty & Uncle? They both are out of town. Anvaya actually. I almost forgot. I've left clothes on terrace for drying. I'll come just come. Give them to me. What exactly you mean by 'Not a bad idea'? Does that mean a 'YES'. I invited you when no one's at home over Janhavi. And I prepared coffee going through a lot of struggles. Further, I wore a saree for the first time in my life for you. 'Not a bad idea'? Anvaya, where are you going? Anvaya, Anu. Wait Anu. Anu. Anvaya wait for me. Heyy Varun, leave me. I just don't know how to put my excitement in words. I know. Wait Anvaya. We'll stop this here. Everything's gonna be ok Anvaya. You're getting bit physical Varun. We like each other so let's get married. No Varun! I need some time. Oh! I'm sorry. I thought you've moved on from that. It's okay take your time. What are you talking about? I mean your past love story and break up. I think you haven't come out of it completely yet. What? How do you know about that? I heard when you were talking to your brother. Were you eaves dropping? Let me finish Anvaya. Actually. What's wrong if I listen? Why did you bring that topic now? I thought it might be the reason for you to stop me. So, if I hadn't stopped you from kissing you would've thought that I moved on. You'll believe my love only if I sleep with you now? Don't judge my character depending on your physical needs. What's wrong with you Anvaya? I loved you before I even know all these. I didn't love after judging your character. I never had such a thing in my mind. Then why did you bring it out at a time like this? You don't have to pity me. You were doubting me that I'd accepted you before I moved on. Yes, I had a breakup, but I forgot him as soon as I landed in India. As if you really did forget. I came to airport to surprise you, but you ignored me there. Why were you upset that day? Later, you didn't come out of your room for next 3 days. I thought you were in the same mood. If that was the case, why did you propose me? Is it to kiss and hug me? Now I understand your intentions clearly. All you were thinking was to be getting laid as soon as I accept your proposal. Relax Anvaya. You're thinking wrong completely. My character won't get bad just by hugging or kissing a girl. Your acts define your character. I don't have to judge it. Do you think I'm characterless? You kissed and hugged me when I kissed and hugged you. If I'm characterless, what are you then? Look who's talking about my character? You are the one who came from US, I should re-evaluate your character. Character depends on personality not on nationality. You can kiss me only if I allow you to. Do you understand? It's not even 10min, you already made me to hate you. Get lost. I never you'd be this fickle minded. Now I understand the reason behind your breakup. I'll call police if you don't leave my house. How dare you to say that? You Bloody Idiot. You jerk. After that argument, I called Anvaya on her phone, but she blocked me.. I went to her home to meet directly. Auntie, Is Anvaya at home? No Varun, She has gone to a party with Jaanu. Okay, just let her know that I came for her. I was following her for last 3 days. Finally, I found her here. I'll ask her why is she avoiding me? I also need to find out who's she meeting in this apartment? I'll make her spill everything. Anvaya, I want to talk to you. Are you following me? Yes, why are you avoiding me? Thanks, you understood that I'm avoiding you. Why am I being avoided for your mistake? You put my number on block list. You don't meet me even if I come to your home. But you're coming here daily. What's going on? I was feeling guilty that I might be wrong on that day. Now you proved me wrong. What is wrong? You're the one who forgot our beautiful travel and hung around bloody 5 minutes fight. This can be resolved by talking but you don't even care about it. If you'd let me be for few days after our fight, I might have realised. But you tortured me on and on calling me repeatedly on my phone. You even came to my house without even thinking that my parents would be at home. I don't like if someone tries to control my space and life. You don't even find some time to spend with me, yet you spend hours and hours here in this apartment. Who stays in those flats? What are you doing inside? You still doubt me Varun. Keep doing this. You're ruining your life and your company by following me. But I don't even look back for you. Go to hell! Do you think I can't find out what's going on here? I'll find out everything! I'll make you and the one inside pay for everything. Bloody 101. Who are you? What do you want? I want to see your son? Call him. I'm still a bachelor. There would be someone of my age. Call him. He's finished today. No one stays here except me. So, is she coming for you daily? Are you Varun? Yeah. Hai, Hai hai. Come in. Who are you? Myself Borabati Buchibabu. Everyone call be Professor B B Babu. I'm working as a Psychology Lecturer at Central University. Mental Engineering is my hobby. You mean, Is she suffering from mental illness? No No, Nothing like that. She was here before for psychological counselling to come out of her US break up. It was resolved in 2-3 sessions, then she met you I thought she doesn't need me anymore. But again, she had a breakup and I had to resume my counselling. I don't understand why you all men stress them so badly. Hey got it! Chicken Soup for the Soul. I mush have forgot it here last night. Now tell me. What's your problem? I want Anvaya Sir. I want her love. We had our best moments, But she doesn't care about all of them because of bloody 15 minutes fight we had. It's not her mistake. Is it my mistake then? Nope. Not yours as well. Then whose? You don't have to yell at me. Sorry Sir, I can't live without her. Your love story has a villain. You can't resolve this until unless you convince him. Who the heck is that villain? Is it her dad or her brother? Or even worse her US boyfriend? Not them as well. Then? Do you want me to describe him or show him? I'd prefer to meet him. I'm going to beat the hell out of him if he tries to come stand between me and Anvaya. Before I show him to you, why don't you tell me about yourself? I heard you're a founder of some bull shit company. I also heard that it's nothing but show off. You don't have to consider yourself as a Mark Zukerberg for this shit you own. What the hell are you talking? Such a worthless business, good for nothing company and your low-class life. I'll kill if you spill a word about my company. What do you know about my company? He's the one. The villain of your love story. What you staring at? How can you let him talk about your company like that? It hurts me a lot. Hello Mr. Professor, 500 members, 100 employees, 3 crores turn over in just 6 months. That's my capability. What the hell do you know about my company? Who the hell is this guy sir? A ghost? He ain't any ghost. He's your inner self. Also called as ALTER EGO in English. I sweetly call him 'LOMA'. My ego? He doesn't like you being in relationship with Anvaya nor able to accept the changes in your lifestyle because of her. And hence he stood tall like a wall between you two. Is that you who came between me and Anvaya? Leave Anvaya. Earn more money. You're about to be a star, a celebrity. Then girls will wait in a line for you. Who the hell are you to control me? Varun, you can't harm him physically. He normally doesn't listen to anyone unless one pampers with love. More it hurts greater it grows. All you need to do is convince him and you two must stand on the same page. Did you hear that? I was fed on your success. You can't even touch me. I won't step back in your love story. You're just an Idiot. Everyone in this is a slave to their ego. I'M THE KING!!! What is this sir? I thought my love was in problem but what is his problem? Don't get confused Varun. Your love and your ego aren't two different problems. He's the problem for your love. What am I supposed to do now sir? In order to solve this, I need to know how your fight has started. So tell me in detail what happened on that day? Anvaya invited me to her home. I went to her home and rang the bell. She opened the door for me. She was looking gorgeous in yellow saree. Was it embroidered? - Yes sir. I think so. - Come in. She prepared coffee for me then we both went to get the clothes from terrace. You should have ironed them and put them in cup board as well. Don't make fun of it sir. Varun, I'm not in a mood to enjoy your romance. So shall we skip to the main content? Now tell me how your fight started? Okay Sir. I think we should stop here. Everything will be okay. You're getting bit physical Varun. We both like each other. So let's get married. It's not about that. I need some time. Oh. I'm sorry. I thought you've moved on from that. It's okay! Take your time. What are you talking about? I mean your past love story and break up. - I think you haven't come out of it yet. - Freeze. What happened? As soon as you brought her break up topic, It hurted Anvaya badly and Anvaya's LOMA reacted to it. See here! I think you still did not come out of your breakup. What? How do you know about that? I heard when you were talking to your brother. Shameless creature. He doesn't have manners at all. He was planning to take advantage of your break up. Were you eavesdropping on me? Freeze. So when she asked you if you were eavesdropping, It hurted your ego and your LOMA popped out of you. Were you eavesdropping on me? What the hell is wrong with you? Can't you wait till I complete at least? Listen to me Anvaya. What wrong if I listen as long as I don't take it in a wrong way. I do take it wrong. You can't stop me from doing that. Don't pretend as if you're decent. You're not here to bring me out of this misery. Don't over react. I can beat the crap out of you. Just be in your limits. Such a character less rouge. Why am I still trying to convince you? Street dogs are way better than you in character. Whom are you refering to? How would I expect better behaviour from a cheap fellow like you. You are such a jerk. You're the one who stayed in US and you don't get to judge my character. Don't ever dare to judge me. I'll kill you if you ever do that. You can try your best. Behave properly. - Why am I still wasting my time? - Then get lost already. So, that's how it has happened. It's not you two who actually fought, there were four in fact. When you two are in love there is no place for egos but as soon as they see a small disturbance amoung you, War between egos is far worse than nuclear war between countries. It's very dangerous. What shall we do now? You'll have to face it. You'll have to face him. You somehow have to convince him in order to succeed in your love. You don't have an option. At the same time don't neglect Anvaya, meet her regularly. Access, Maintain, Effection. Great, do as he says. How do you even listen to his shit. Meet Anvaya, but when you meet her kiss her and make her fall on your feet. Or else slap her hard. But if you ever be sorry or apolosize her, I'll turn your love story to bloody horror story. Sir, is he really my inner self? He's Scary. You fed him with all your love and affection. You've to bear him. Next time when you meet Anvaya, don't take him along with you. I mean keep your ego aside when you are talking to her. While I love Anvaya so much, I don't understand why my inner self hates her? I'm totally confused. How can I get rid of him and meet Anvaya? Hello, focus on your driving first. I don't want to die along with you for your negligence. So stop thinking about trash. I mean Anvaya. Can't you sit quietly? I can't do that as long as you keep thinking about her. She hurted me. That bloody girl. Stop your nonsense. It's just a teaser my dear. You still have plenty ahead. I'll show you the hell. Why don't you accept Anvaya? What is your problem? Remember the days when Anvaya wasn't part of your life. You were the best! You've your own way of doing things. You had good habits and are always focused. You always worked hard for your company. You neither wasted a single minute nor waited for anyone. But now, you chat whole night. Irrespective of circumstances, you run for her. You've become her driver to pick up and drop her. You even waited for hours and hours while she was busy. She changed your complete life style. So I can't her for you. What? I'm your success bro. I won't let you fail. Trust me. Don't trust girls these days, they'll drown you. Villain? Who's he? LOMA. LOMA? Is that new kind of scooty brand or what? It's my inner self. My alter ego. He's deeply disturbed because of Anvaya. He has become a villain to my love story. Why is it only for you? Does everyone have LOMA? Everyone have their individual inner self just like mine. Didn't get you. Could you elaborate it? Hold it. Suppose this is you. Okay. When I tell you that, I and Anvaya broke up. How'd you react? Why don't you try to convince Anvaya. You somehow have to get things back on track. Assume this is LOMA. Okay. Drink it. Dude. I and Anvaya broke up. What shall I do? That's a great news dude. Leave her. She doesn't deserve you. So that's LOMA. He's the villain. Wow. I don't see him as a villain. He's my hero. Idiot. My love story is screwed because of him. I'm not in a mood for this. We are not here to sleep. Just two shots, you'll be relieved from all your stress. You have to cheer up. Okay? - Bro, two shots please. - Okay madam. Cheers. Drink it. Come on Anvaya. Come! Why did you come out? I've seen Anvaya inside. How are you feeling now? It's enraging. Who the fu** is it? Bloody a** ho**. Who threw it on me? Sorry, sorry. Look at him. I think he picks up fight with everyone. Disgusting. What did you say? I was a hero when I fought for your dad and even when I fought for you. But I'm disgusting when I fight for my friend. All girls are same. I'm here to find a way to heal my pain but you already started partying. Shit. We're waiting time here. Let's go. No matter how hard I try, we're getting apart from each other.

So we decided not to get into horroscope and astrology this time. Moreover, he's going back to US in 2 weeks and fortunately girl looks so pretty and we're happy. Where do you work? I supply vegetables to companies like Heritage Fresh, Reliance Fresh etc. We've more than 400 customers all over the state. It's not just about vegetables, I want everything to be fresh in my life. I hope that she doesn't have any love and break ups before. I want to talk to him personally. What do you want to talk now? You can talk him after marriage freshly. I also want to talk to her personally. They should get to know about each other. Let them go and talk. We've give complete freedom to her. Freedom of? You can't expect everything to be fresh like you vegetables. I had a love story and we Broke up as well. Please ignore him. I don't have a problem with that. What was the agreement? 10 crores of property in dowry. My dad was really excited for this so do I. Very good. See Rajesh, I don't like the idea of dowry. What? Only reason I agreed to see you was you stay in US. I didn't like your family at all. Can I talk to you? What else you want to talk when she put her opinion out already? You are? Professor Babu. B B PU. Hai Uncle. What a surprise? I thought of coming to your home. I learnt from your mom about this So I rushed here to stop you from saying yes. Good for me, you already said no to him. I want to talk to you. These people are confusing me a lot Uncle. My past relationships lead to breakup when it comes to my love life. I compromised myself for an arranged marriage but everyone here is interested in dowry and my past rather that compatibility. I want to talk to you. What else you want to talk? - Just wanted to say good bye. - Okay. Leave. Bye Sir. So this is it. Let's go home. What happened? Will tell you on the way. Anything wrong? Why are they leaving? What happened? She doesn't like me it seems. You ruined this as well. Worthless crap. What did I do? Girls like you have to fight. I'm fighting already Uncle. Not with the people around you. You fight should be with your inner self. Only then you can be happy with others. This old piece of crap is not making any sense at all. You can't fight and win against me. All you can do is listen to what I say. Anu. I met Varun yesterday. I've seen his sincerity and true love for you. You're making a bigger mess of your problem by avoiding him. He might have lost his mind. Don't listen to him, Anu. Shut up. Can't you see what are we doing? Don't interfere. Uncle. Shut up! Get out. I'd advise you to talk and settle this out. You asked him for some time before marriage and you can't avoid him now. You and your ego both share equal hatred on him. Unlike you he's fighting with his ego in order to make things right between you. You got to fight with your ego or else it'll be another breakup story of your life. Come on be fair Anvaya. Give him one more chance. Keep your ego aside and talk to him. Let me try Uncle. Come one man! Hi Sudhakar, how are you? Who are you? He hasn't changed a bit. Hello, I'm talking to you. Come with me, I'll detail you everything. Once upon a time we both used to be chuddie buddies and studied in same school. LK Padu Elimentary School. None of these matches now a days are good enough for you. I'm worried that you might go back to US suddenly. Yeah, I might say that. Let's go! Happy b'day dear Mango. Happy b'day to you. What are you waiting for. Cut the cake. Come on. It already looks like a piece of cake. Is this a cake? All those cakes are routine Mango, this is the new trend. Cupcakes. Whose idea is this? Who else, Prakash's. Unlike us he's always dedicated to work. Please cut them into small pieces. Have this. Hai Mango. Where are you? At home. Are you interested in coming to office. I can't tolerate Prakash's over action any more. He feels like he's the CEO to this office. I know about him. I don't doubt his work either. Yah, including Pooja's work as well. What are you looking for? Match box. Where did they all go? I've thrown them in dustbin. I know only you'd such a thing. What are you doing Mohan? You're crossing your limits these days. I can do whatever I want. Do you have a problem with that? Yeah, I understood that when you stole my credit card from my bag. I'm not a thief. I'm your husband, I've all the rights to do that. I'll trash your bones if you cross your limits. You can't hide your mistakes by yelling at me. I'll do whatever I wish. Don't even dare to stop me. Would you both stop it now at least? Please part your ways if you can't stay together. You might at least be happy that way. If you can't understand and support each other, it's better to get divorced. Give me 10 mins. I'll find a permanent solution for your problem. Come in sir. Please take your seat. Who needs divorce here? My parents. And you're really supporting them to do that? That's an interesting concept. This is the least I can do for them. And you're encouraging them to get divorced. Are they the couple? Yes, they are. Please sign on these papers. I'll take care of further proceedings. You sign here and you here. At last he somehow managed to understand us. He's getting us divorced. You sign these papers first. I took an oath to follow my husband's footsteps. So, you go ahead and sign it first. Why should I? I don't let anyone blame me that I applied for divorce first. So, you sign it first. You always think men are superior to women, so why don't you sign it first being a man. I'm not signing the papers until you sign them. Sir, please mail those papers. I'll get them signed somehow. I'm not sure how much you understood them but in 5min I can perceive it very clearly. I don't know how much you know your parents for all these years. But I understood very clearly. They prefer to fight for rest of their life than to stay apart from each other. I'll take leave then. Sir. What happened to you mom? You should have signed those papers, I'm here to take care of you. It all started when I was carrying you. Generally, when a woman is pregnant, along with some biological Changes we'll also encounter emotional fears and unreasonable doubts. These are called 'Pregnancy Tantrums'. I doubted him that he might be seeing another woman leaving me at my parents. I unreasonably used to pick up an argument and fought with him all day. It was my mistake, but he never left me. When you were 10 years old, he was bankrupted and lost everything in business. He came home drinking and fought with me every night. It was his mistake, but I never intended to leave him. I know it's our mistake to fight over every small thing, But we don't have an idea to move apart. We're willing to stay together against all the odds. Love is not just looking at the positive side of the person, But to accept their negatives as well. Anvaya. I want to talk to you for 30 minutes. Can I get your time? I promise that I don't irritate you after this. Leave your ego aside and talk to him. Let me try Uncle. I never thought it'd be this hard to talk leaving our egos behind. True. I don't want to break this relationship with you Anvaya. I want you to be there for me. I appreciate that, but what did you do to resolve it conflicts? She's too arrogant bro. Why couldn't she try from the beginning? How come you are here? What do you think? Wherever you go my network follows bro. Please don't disturb us. Let me talk to her peacefully. You didn't give me a chance to try, Anvaya. Give him one more chance. He tried to take physical advantage in his first attempt. He'll take you to OYO room if you give him one more chance. Don't fall in his trap again. She really is spoilt minded. She always doubted your character. It's pointless blaming you for all this. She's the one responsible, such a shameless woman. Don't count us in your worthless conversation. Do I look like a mad girl? You should take all the blame instead of her. You are one who kept on following her even after she rejected. I'll kill you if you don't shut your mouth. Don't underestimate me just because you're a man. I can kick your ass all over. - Let's see who does that better. - You bloody. ♪ Why are you so arrogant? ♪ ♪ You don't get to dominate me.. Get lost ♪ ♪ I've seen enough of you. ♪ ♪ What makes you so conceit? ♪ ♪ You are like an adhesive. ♪ ♪ Go away from me ♪ ♪ I've seen enough of you too. ♪ ♪ No, don't come after me you idiot ♪ ♪ Don't bark gratuitously, shut your mouth ♪ ♪ I'll kick your bass ♪ ♪ around if you don't stop. ♪ ♪ As if you actually can do it ♪ ♪ Why are you so arrogant? ♪ ♪ You don't get to dominate me..

I don't think we can work this out Varun. I hope you understand that our egos may not accept our love forever. We can't satisfy them. I don't think I can do it. We've to move on Varun. Good Bye. Anvya. Such a filthy woman. - Why are you so hard on Anvaya? - I might have hurt her so badly. I know what I'm doing. She really kicked my butt all over the floor. So if you stop thinking about her, we can go to office. Excuse me sir! Yeah, Prakash. Congratulations sir! What for? It's been a year we started Anvaya sir. Is it? It's prepared all reports over night. I need your signature before sending these to audit. Yeah... Pen... You don't have to come to office if you keep thinking about her. Work as her watchman. It'd suit you better. You don't even know that it's been a year until someone tell you. This is not just a company, it's your life. Hundreds of employees have put their trust on you. It holds emotions of thousands of parents. Don't screw your life thinking about her. Focus on your work. Check each and every page and sign it. Prakash.. I have to read these in detail. You can go now. I did that already sir Yeah, I know... but I didn't check them properly. So I'll check them and call you. Okay... What happened? Is everything alright? Nothing... Give me a pen and paper. Prakash... What is this? This is completely fraud. In first 3 months we invested 5 lakhs in publicity And 300 members joined in our company but next 9 months we spent 97 lahks And only 32 members joined our company. The out flow of money didn't stop, and no one joined as well. What is this? What exactly is happening Prakash? Prakash... What is this now? My resignation. I trusted you more than anyone. How could you do this? I could do that because you trusted me so much. Do you think I will leave you with this? I will file a case against you. I didn't leave any evidence to prove me as a fraud. I have maintained everything legally. What did you do with the money? I have found my own company with your money and your idea. For your kind information I have every right to start a company. I don't care whatever you do, but you did it with my money, my idea and with my database. What else do you want me to do? You shifted all your focus on one family member with thinking about your employees and other members. So, I have created my own for all those. Coming to your money, I'll repay every penny with interest as soon as I see profits. Goodbye.. Please check our website in your free time. I was afraid of this all the time. This wouldn't have happened if you weren't in love with her. This could have been even worse if I hadn't involved. It is the crucial thing. Succeeding itself is not part of life but holding onto it is the crucial thing. Are you listening to me? What are you thinking about? About Anvaya. Now I will kick your ass if I hear that name again. First exchange this name it's pissing me off! That doesn't do any good for us now. We must do something about its future. Increase the promotions, introduce the new schemes, to attract new members... Its already been a year, plan an anniversary function, get together. Hold on! Hold on! What did you just say? Anniversary, throw a party... Arrange a get together. Get together! Yes! Print the invitations, call media, promote more. One more important thing, invite Anvaya's family personally. Let her know that you don't worry about your breakup and you're trying to move on in life. She should be jealous of your progress and I should enjoy that thoroughly. Anvaya, groom and his parents are here. Get ready and come down quickly. She didn't cook all these. We bought them all from the shop. Keep quiet! How was your journey? - Yeah. - Anu.. Come sit. This is Anvaya, she has done MBA in California. This is Raghava, he works in US. - Hi! - Hi! Raghava would you like to talk to her personally? They might be uncomfortable with us around... - Anvaya why don't you show him our garden? - Yeah! Please go with her. Do you think we won this case? We won it with a huge margin. Leave them alone. That's not your plate. This is yours. Are you still differentiating us? We are going to be in-laws today or tomorrow. I mean your daughter would be my in-law and my son would be your in-law. If we fix our marriage in next two weeks, would it be possible for your son to come from US? He will come by next flight for his sister marriage. So, shall we fix the dates then? That settles it. Thank you! What are you feeling now? Close Varun's chapter in your life. Raghava looks very decent. Marry him! Respect your ego. You'll not even remember this trash once you get married. So get ready for marriage happily. - He's very tall! Isn't it? - Yeah! Yeah! Sure he is. They both make a good couple. Yes, looks adorable. I liked that guy. Hey Banana. How are you? My name is mango sir. Whatever, both are fruits only. How are you? I was doing fine until now! What's up? Charan. He's not Charan, its Varun! - Actually. Hi Varun. How are you? - I'm good Auntie. - Come in. - Give me a moment. Yah. You've to attend the party. Very good. We'll come for sure. Please let Anvaya know that we've invited her as well. She'll also join along with us. Why don't you come inside? That's okay Auntie. We've to invite so many people. We've to go. Don't forget to give this to Anvaya. I'll make sure of it. Bye Auntie. Bye. Heyy Jack Fruit, take care. I'll keep them ready for you in the party. Come and eat. Just kidding. Now, let them go. Anu. Varun came to invite all of us for his company's anniversary celebrations. He invited you in specific. Don't go. Okay. Dry it. How dare him to invite you for the party. Does he expect you to be jealous of his achievement and want you to weep for that? I want to kill him so badly. Let him know that you're going to get married in two weeks and you came here to wave a permanent goodbye. Heyy Rakesh. What a sudden surprise? I was worried that I might miss this. Got my leave approved at the last minute. Varun! Thank you so much for coming. Fantastic show. Looks amazing. It's our first anniversary, so thought to make it grand. Were you able to satisfy your ego? I guess so. You've to hold on to situations like these are and satisfy him as much as you can. Varun.. Is he the mental counsellor? Idiot. Sorry Sir. I'm not mental counsellor, I'm a psychologist, psychotherapist. As if I'd remember all those names. Then you should not keep it open. Open what? Your mouth. Heyy Apple. For the nth time. My name is neither Apple nor Banana. - My name is raw mango. Shit sorry it's just Mango.. - Whatever! Sudhakar, let's go. Do we know each other. LK Padu elementary school. We are Chuddie Buddies. Hai Varun. Hai Auntie. I think I'm late to the party. It's okay Auntie. Please follow me Auntie. Hai Anvaya. Hai Varun. Thank you for coming. It's okay. Hello and welcome to everyone. We'd like to hear some feedback from our valued members. Thank you... I don't get a phone call from my son in London, But these people call me twice or thrice at least in a day. I'm so happy and relieved after joining here in Anvaya. Their services are very good. Thank you! I felt lack of support when my daughter left for UK. But I don't feel it anymore. Thanks to Anvaya. We're very happy now. Hello everyone. I'm neither a member nor an employee of Anvaya. Varun.. Varun! To talk about Varun in one word, Every parent would be blessed to have a son like him. I've a huge respect for his parents for having such a wonderful son. Awesome job! Keep it going Varun.. Thank you! - No No I can't. - Talk something. Greetings everyone. Nice party! Varun is a sweet boy. All the best! Thank you so much. Thank you Auntie. Good evening everyone. Thank you very much for joining us today. Anavaya.. I never thought Anvaya would change my life so drastically. Varun wouldn't have existed without Anvaya. I'm not the only one behind this success, my friends who supported my idea, My staff who worked along with play a major role in this success. Thank you so much guys. You might have come across so many services like cab services, food delivery etc., But we're different to them. They all satisfy our needs... Today, I'm not a son not only to my parents but also to every family here. I'm so happy for that. This is more of an expanding family rather than business. I pledge to serve you throughout my life. Thank you thank you so much. Excuse me! It's ok! I'm Varun's father. I was so angry when I heard that he started this business. I was also worried that he might lose everything in this and end up worthless like me. I scolded him. We haven't lent him any support. Not even financially. But he proved me wrong with in a year. I feel guilty after witnessing his success instead of being proud. I lost everything in business 20 years ago. I didn't start any other business with a fear of losing again. I was so humiliated. I didn't take up any job in these 20 years. But now, I really feel proud of him. If only I had 1% of courage and patience what he has displayed, my life wouldn't have ended up like this. Varun. Congratulations to you! Would you mind giving me a job in your office...? I don't bother about salary, but I'll work with dedication. I'm sorry. - It's ok! - I'm sorry. Hai. I'm Varun's mother. Hai. We know Anvaya very well. She even came to our home once. That name worked like a lucky charm in Varun's life. Actually. Hai Raghava. Anvaya's fiance. They're getting married in 2 weeks. We'll come home and invite you. You all must come to the wedding. We'll leave. Greetings! Come. Did I make you wait? Did you see his reaction after knowing about marriage. He's finished! I was waiting for a moment like this. Now I'm totally satisfied. Yes. What are you doing here alone? You don't even understand how happy I was when all our members were praising you. It was a goose bump moment. Young entrepreneur, businessman with services. Moment of the day for me was when dad asked you for a job. Whole media will talk about you. Varun, this name will reverberate everywhere. Moments like these will give us extreme pleasure in life. You made me proud today. Come on bro. Don't be dull. Stop it.! This is your success not mine. I didn't feel an inch of your happiness. Get out and leave me alone. Why are you so depressed at a moment like this? You should have listened to me from the beginning regarding Anvaya. Now she stole all your happiness. Yes, you're correct. My happiness and sadness are incomplete without Anvaya. Your absence doesn't bother me at all but I'm not able to bear the pain of Anvaya marrying someone else. It's hurting me here so badly. That's what love is all about. What is your problem? You mean that this success means nothing to you without Anvaya? You stupid. Anvaya is my success. She's my achievement. Now she's leaving me permanently. Are you happy now? You'd be happy, of course. I stood top in my 10th, I topped engineering, won sports medals. I grew up to be an obedient son, a good friend and became a young entrepreneur now. All these to satisfy you and make you happy. What all I asked you is to accept Anvaya and my love towards her in return, but you didn't. In fact you made things even worse time to time. I lost Anvaya now, so I don't have to deal with you anymore. I'll live a robotic life with a good boy tag. Is this what you want from me? You're the villain in my life. Why do you think I'd be good to you? I'll start drinking. I'll get addicted to girls and drugs. I'll become rouge that everyone hates. I'll let you down and kill you with my own hands. Please stop it bro. I never thought you'd be this upset. You don't have to be a bad guy to get rid of me. I'll accept Anvaya. I'll support your love story. I want you to be like this. I want you to be winner, even in your love. Please trust me I'd never be a villain in your life. I'll stay inside and watch over you. Did you meet Varun? Yeah, I did. Amazing guy. I left them 4 years ago and I never was this relaxed in my four years. He really took care of them very good. Yes.. Mom. I want to meet him and thank him personally. We've watched his program on live. Sandhya almost cried for his speech. Yeah. His father too spoke very nice. I hope you didn't forget to invite them for wedding. I already invited them on anniversary function. They are the one taking care of pre-wedding and wedding photo shoots. That's great. What was that all about? How can they praise someone else in front of me. He's doing it for money not out of charity. It's just a business, damn it! You didn't even thank my dad who released your property. Within months that was in court for almost 30 years. Mango, Anvaya's brother called us and Asked us to provide a team for pre wedding photo shoot. Tell him to find someone else. We're not doing any work for them. What's the point in yelling at me? Even I'm angry on them. I'll call and tell that we no longer provide services to them. Yeah. Tell them. Ask them to cancel their membership as well. Don't let your personal feelings take over your professional life. We'll provide them a photographer. But how can. We're sending them a photographer.

We've a small gift for all of you here. Anvaya and Raghava's pre-wedding photo shoot. Thank you Thank you. I'm waiting for it. Please play. Wait.. Wait. But before that we've collected videos from our beloved groom's colleuges and friends who stay in US. We are going to play them first. Thank you! Rakesh, please play. What is this nonsense? Stop that video first. What the hell is this? You better answer that question to Anvaya and everyone here. What is this Raghava? Are you married already? That's not me, that's a fake video. Varun should have morphed that video. Dad, please call the police urgently and get them arrested. Don't believe him Anvaya. He's trying to ruin our marriage. Let's consider this video be a fake. Do you want me to prove it online? Rakesh, connect the call to Stella. Connect it! You Raghava, asshole. Don't spare this guy. This is Stella from New Jersey. I married this bastard Ragahava in 2018.. At that time I didn't know his real intentions.. He only married me for my money and US citizenship and after he got set, He just left me.. Rakesh and Stella work in the same office in US. Rakesh found him familiar and to confirm his doubts he called Stella immideatly. We gathered all the photo and video evidences. This bastard cheated Stella for US citizenship & money And he's marrying Anvaya for her property. This is a picture-perfect plan. Mr. Satyanarayana Murthy Gaaru. As a senior lawyer could you advise what all the charges, we can file against your son? We can directly file a cheating case against all. They will cancel his US visa if we hand him over to US police. Scoundrel. I won't spare you. I'll hand over you to police personally. Hello excuse me. Why are you making a big scene out of this? Yes, it is true that I'm married already. What's wrong in that? As if I've comitted a big crime. You intended to cheat me and my daughter. Don't you think it's wrong? Is it so? As if your daughter is decent. We all know that your daughter too had a love story and broke up with him as well. Who knows whether it was just a breakup or abortion? A break up story doesn't make her characterless. Could mean that she doesn't like his character too. I'll kill you, if you spill a word about Anvaya. Get lost! Bloody rascal. Varun, you go and talk to her. What? Anvaya, Anvaya. Please open the door. What's happening here...? Anvaya, Please, open the door Anvaya. It's not your mistake, please open the door. You don't have to feel guilty about it. Please open the door Anvaya. I didn't understand what love exactly is when we were together. I can only understand when we split apart. Anvaya, please open the door. You've moved very far from me before I can realise. I fought with myself for you and for your love and I won. I don't have ego anymore. I love you Anvaya. I need you in my life. Please open the door. Sir, she's not opening the door. Please speak to her. Don't worry. What if she com its suicide? I know about her, she won't do such a thing. Give her some time. Stop. Don't fall for his sweet talk. It's a trap. He'll brag that you were only saved because of him for rest of his life. So, don't get convinced. Let is go. We'll find another. Shut up. What excatly did he do? He still loves me after all I've done to him. Is that his mistake? I fell for your words and agreed to marry Raghava, but Varun saved me today. Is that a crime? Why do you hate so much? It's not your fault. It was my mistake to encourage you and fed you all these years. I was in hallucinating that my attitude is my self-defence and attraction, but I was wrong. I don't need you anymore. Varun can protect me for rest of his life. I value relationship with Varun more than anything. Go to hell! Anvaya. Anvaya. Open the door Anvaya. What is this Anu? How did you let a guy like Varun & his love go and agreed to marry a jerk? Everyone says that I'd forget things easily. But I never forgot my love towards you or your mother or your brother. I still remember your first touch after you were born. Remember this thing, we should never forget the people who love and care for us. Now go to Varun and talk to him. I'm sorry. It's okay. Join us uncle. If you agree, we've decided to get my friend. Sudhakar's daughter Anvaya marry to your son Varun. So, we've summoned you urgently here. Mom. Congrats. I want you promise me that no matter whatever you face, You should never let your egos take over the past issues and enjoy your beautiful present. I promise! I promise! Now that's good. Once they've understood and promised is more than enough for a marriage. That's the end. I'm worried that my ego might come out and cause unnecessary issues again. You don't have to worry about that. In case if it pops out you both know how to handle it. That's not a problem. The ego clash has now started between those two. Jahnavi. Yes. Shall we both get married? No Mango, I need some time. How dare her to postpone it? He already started yelling at you. You can't be happy with him. Don't step back on your word.
