CENSOR CERTFICATE Get up…get up. Come on, up…up… Come on…get up Get up… Come.. Good morning , welcome to ‘Laser Live’ And today it’s on Breakfast’. Let’s see, after a night of expectations… here we’re on a session with marvels. See…Appam. We better don’t call it ‘Appam’, more sort of a half-way point between a dosa and a papad, a half breed of mishap. See…she is the sculptor. ...and leaving out all those, we have another inevitable presence of no wonder… the Water’. So, will be back with another program, ok? Ma’am, you called for me? What’s happening with France? So naughty, all the more… yesterday he got into fight. What if this continues? Parents are doing nothing! ‘France Laser, his name! He couldn’t even write that with no mistakes. What was it yesterday? What was the fight about? Tejas stripped my trouser. Tejas? Tejas….? Teacher…I was looking for the Spiderman thingy… Come here…come here… Checking to see…if he has the Spiderman underwear. Playing with underwear? Don’t! Ask your mother to give me a call. Huh… Spiderman, superman…really? Why are you guys in school? To study… See to it. I’ll Anyhow I’ll meet with Tejas’s parents. Ok! Again late… They kicked-off from the morning, one in instagram and the other tik tok. Can’t we find a single reason to get them to work? Life should have some fantasies… …to boot life into our life. Give a 100. Sir…please check this design too. Ok with this, we have the total to Rs 4550/. After the sale of puzhakkal property, I’ll pay off. Shall I leave? Got any idea of how many 100s through…? Aagh… Huh, this was your pastime? Making as if you’re here for football. Got a cancelled order, pizza! Pizza? Come on… A classmate of mine is a Priest/ father, principal in Deva Matha School. They got a vacancy, asked if I’m interested to take up the job? Close to home Maybe we can get an admission for France. Biju chetta...he is Anson. Namaste Sir! There is a minor mess of Rs 50,000/ Got anything to atop? Who all got 5/5? Ok, hands down. France? Show me your book? Stand up. I can’t…I can’t stand this anymore. Ansa…got a design for the concept. I had submitted a concept in a new company, if it makes through, all will be good. ‘Learn to creep before you leap’ Even if the elephant lose weight, he cannot be kept in a corral. Oh…if elephant shed a lot weight, not corral he can fit into even a toilet. Do you know that? First you invested money like water for your own startup company, Now you are trying to bend over backwards for branding another company. Anson, why don’t you decide to stand up for one of your decision? Your monthly rent can only be made on 6th? Great! Hey old hag… What…? Why are you babbling? How long I have been asking you to cut that tree? I won’t… How many times you have been here? Here is yesterday’s dictation… Not that he got it wrong; He also made it look like he got full marks 5 out of 5. Exams are drawing closer. Hello… We gave a thought, looks like we’re not in need of an advertisement. How about considering once more…? What is it? Any hope? What did they say? France? Come on, do your homework. Go after we wrap up this game. I have been calling him for a long time to finish homework. He is still playing with his grandfather. Grandfather already made enough wreck to the family with his playing. Now he is not far behind ruining the child too. Anson! Every day I can’t put up with the fight for rent. Whatever I say, he refuses to say a word. Hey Ansa…add Apple and Microsoft too. However you wrote all the brands with very little possibilities. Our marketing is not right, that’s our issue. It’s not an issue but a failure, that’s our failure. Here comes another failure. Joss chetta, having fun? Do you need some fun? Ah? People want to nose around every matter, having or not having fun. Jose chetta, it’s been two weeks. Where were you? I went for a retreat. Where? Potta? Not Potta, in Attapadi. But Jose chetan is a teetotaler and no smoking too. I was not there for those but for to pray, to change my mother’s mind. For what? To get the puzhakkal property. If not, my 5 sisters will swallow up that too. Hey, let me say what I came for, I saw Shashi. Shashi from Idikulla agency? A work proposed to them, they agreed to arrange the meeting. C-guard Kochu Lona is the one. Now it’s all up to you guys. Actually once Kochu Lona’s marriage alliance was brought up for my niece, Linda. He was a door to door salesman at those times. But our pride never satisfied with the status of the family. Now give a look. Where is C- guard and where is Linda lying? Where is Linda lying? You better take care of your things. This is our family’s curse. What’s Kochu Lona’s product? He studied something related to electronics. To invent some power supply ideas into business, he asked for a loan of Rs 50000/ to his father. 50,000/ was a huge amount in the past. Huh… He sold his house’s rear end property. See how far he got, from 50 thousand he made 50 thousand cr. Why can’t my mother give the Ten cent of the puzhakkal property? Look as though the snake won’t die and the stick remains unbroken. How come the snake is not dead? Why don’t you ask your father? Patience too got a breaking point. Why can’t you keep your mouth shut? Not just Attapadi, he won’t change even after a visit to Rome. France... Dad’s wish is that you should play for India. So…could I win? Winning and losing should never matter, what we do is play our best. There are four rules to reap success in our life. You know the first rule? Nope… Set a goal. Kick a goal? Not about kicking the ball, We should have a clear determination, an aspiration. Not the little dreams, dream big to become something out of life. Hey…there is no world cup for card games. K’ay? Ok.. Don’t blow your time in the card games. Keep it there. Da…, Superman is already here. Da…play well, remember what I said. Hello Yes Job, go on… Give the presentation.

Come You know well… Sister! How much? 6,000 Oh! You take card? hmm Will you? Yes. Here… There is no way I’m holding him back from playing due to a stitch and I’ll never think about it anytime soon. Then why can’t you show the same concern in his studies? We should take stern steps from time to time to improve his language. He’s not in desperate situation for a rank. At this young age what he need is some friends and the right social skills nothing else. How could you impede my every action? Dad…? Yes… I’ll become a scientist. So that you can go to a prison, after falling into some secret conspiracy play. The second rule to bring in success to your life… Neglect naysayers That means…keep the negative jaw chaps at arm’s length. What you mean by negative jaw? Didn’t you here what your granddad said, that you may go to prison if you become a scientist. The exact same thing. Hello…how is he? Just three stitches. It’s a normal injury in the field, let him rest. Day after tomorrow he’ll be in the game. Hello Hello, Anson? Yes… You should come to the south police station. What happened sir?

Who else can iron out other than me? How about we step in to restaurant, we can talk and grab a bite to eat. Yes, sure. You know…these things, this one. I would never touch it. Why is that?

You ruined it…it’s not about the money. it’s the way you do things. France? Mom looks as though she is on a short fuse. Mom got nothing to do.

Now cut to the chase… What are you trying to reap out of it? Both parties can have the yields Now we’re talking… Don’t bother with other things. Not you guys…Eyappan come inside. See Mr. Eyappan. Oh. Your oil company can try, but it’s a long shot and probably won’t survive with this set up. Even if you set it to float on the selling value, In thirty years, can’t expect a profit more than 20lakhs. I can give you 25 lakhs. Take it, stop your company, …and sign the documents stating you’ll never produce the oil again. Sir…no offence. There is someone a ‘Dheeru bhai Ambani’. He was working in a petrol bunk, later he turned out to be the king of Petroleum industries. May be you know about his both children. So, one day my Kesha oil may change the world and pave my way to ..be a billionaire. That’s my dream. I don’t want to put myself in a situation..where my children accuse me of making a stupid assumption by signing it. So to dodge that question I need more money. How about…about… Thirty can’t do…Shashi. Don’t keep mulling over… Can I say something? How about a 40? Make it a round figure… What’s with your thump…? Nothing. Use it…now it became a round figure. 50? Sign it. Money? That is…ready. Check? No check can do. Even though my dream is to be another Ambani, I can’t handle white money. I’m more inclined to black humor. I mean black. That can be arranged, will do Impossible...we got only white. We can manage. Sign it… I can assure. Oh. How long for the cash? Soon… Will be here by the time of drinking a tea. How about a tea? No, coffee please. Ok. I’ll be outside. Talk the rest with the manager. I’ll follow… Oh, this exactly like a dialogue I said in the past. Am I the nut case here or they went crazy? Full amount as said. Ok? Wait…let them leave. Oh…bye. Drop me at the casino. Look how much a name can worth? 50 lakhs. I have to find another name, no more Kesha. Kesha' won't work out.. Now, comes our tag line. No other Kerala girl go under the same predicament For no hair fall use Kesha hair care oil. Good. Thank you very much sir, Ok then, I’ll take a leave. About the payments… France, teacher is here. Wipe that faster. Good morning. Good morning teacher. Sit down …sit down What is it, France? France wrote dirty words on the board. France, what is this? That was not a bad word Then? Write…show me...what did you write. How can you write a word when you’re clueless of alphabets? Which chapter? A smile. Is this the word France? Arranging a string of alphabets on the board cannot be called a word. Or is it a new word created by France. Granddad taught me. Granddad told you this? Pronounce the word? Floccinaucinihilipilification’ You’re saying this is a word. Write it again, let me see if you remember the word granddad taught you. Teacher? France not only wrote the word but also made fun of teacher. It can wait. Ok! Granddad taught you this word, right? How to read it? ‘floccinaucinihilipilification’ Ok, ok…go sit We can learn ‘a smile’ France had improved a lot. I never expected this. He is really smart now.

Dad, how about we call mom too for spell c competition. Let her call if she needs. Yes teacher. Why can’t you clear out your stuffs? We will…we will clear it soon. You know how many people reached me for the house? I’ll say one last thing; two days… you should clear off everything. Teacher…I’ll…soon. Or else I’ll hurl out every single thing. Ok. I called you because…at this situation it’ll be better If the kid is taken care by his mother. I’m not interested… Their lawyer is someone who will drag out three four cases from a single case. Is it because of a scare of losing? You had already read…How much trumped up story about you is written in the petition. Same way we will be forced to make-up stories. Your kid will be prone to learn all these stories. He will not able to trust you or your wife, …because I’ll be writing about your wife. Like insulting her...Understand? So for the better future of the kid, leave the kid with his mother. When you’re financially stable, take the kid with you. There will be more changes in the atmosphere. Take a seat. The show is full on’ Perfect ad and great sale. The kids played well. Kids know the play but no ground. The kids scored well, but the ground was on my chest.

Kids pulled a clean conning, As it is cash deal, I can’t make a move legally. No problem… I can settle the scores well. Jose brother can go. Leave… Jose brother? If you got more pests like this…toss it to me. Ground is ready. Jose brother…take a seat. You better don’t make me sit. I was sitting in the dark for a long time.

I want to watch, how you gonna live peacefully in Trissur with the 50lakhs. Son, come here. Usually mother teaches the kids to become like their father, But you should never learn from him.
