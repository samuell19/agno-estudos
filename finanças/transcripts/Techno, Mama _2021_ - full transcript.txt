Give this to them. Thank you. Do you know what Berlin is? No. Do you know what techno is? Techno... Repeat after me: techno is Berlin. Techno is Berlin. Berlin is techno. Berlin is techno. So this is where I'm going. Where did you get new shoes? Don't tell mom. 20? I told you to use less Cif Cream. You used up all the drain cleaner and sponges. I'm not a cleaning company, you know. Learn how to work efficiently. I'm not going to repeat this again. Your cleaning skills suck anyway.

I don't know how to. And I know that I will be the same As today and yesterday And I know that if someone will change me I will still be me And I know that I will rise Endless number of times with the sun Because just as many times The falling lift will drag me down But there will never be Too much love for me There will never be Too much love for me There will never be Too much love for me...
