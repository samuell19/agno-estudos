(flames whooshing) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) - [Chase] When you're a kid you spend so much time living in your dreams you don't really think about what it's going to take to make them real. My dream, was Rugby League. Mum bought me a footy jersey every year for my birthday. Don't know how she could afford it but somehow, she made it work. My best mate Rhys, he loved his footy too. - AFL! - [Chase] Although he had a funny way of passing it back. - NRL! - AFL! - NRL! - FAL! - And, that's when I could stop him from thinking he was Michael Jackson. And even though NRL and AFL are like chalk and cheese, he made great tackling practice. After dad left, me and mum had some hard knocks. Mums dream didn't quite come true as she'd hoped. But my dream, was rugby league. And mum, she never stopped believing. And so did H, he coached me from when I was young. He'd always say, "These eyes don't lie", which meant he thought I could play, but also, that I couldn't bludge. Now he knew the standard was high, but coming from a town like Wagga, which has a rich history of sporting greats, and even greater haircuts, I had a lot to live up to. If I wanted to be great, I had to trust the process. I need to stay focused, disciplined, on, on track, I need to run faster, tackle harder and nothing was gonna distract me from what... What was I talking about again? (upbeat music) ♪ You should know they're all the same ♪ ♪ They know nothing about love ♪ ♪ Soon he will no longer know your name ♪ ♪ He knows nothing about love ♪ (loud snoring) - Sharon? Shannon? Shaniqua? - What's up? - Could I have the, can you take the Jersey off? - No, nope, not really up for round three. - All right, well. Here. - I'm not a prostitute. - Oh, no, no, no. It's for the cab. I've got a game to play, sorry. - Wow. All right. There you go, champ. Window, old school! - [Chase] Yep, old school. (Rachel laughing) - Yeah look, just so you know, I'm not looking for a relationship. - I wasn't looking for a- - Oh, there I go breaking hearts again. Look, you seem like a good kid, but I reckon you can do better. You'll get there, tiger. You will! And it's Rachel! G'day Noel! - [Noel] Morning love. (upbeat music) - [Commentator] Gee I love a tight game like this one. The last five minutes, well that'll sort the men out from the boys. We'll see who's done the hard work off the field and who's making the shortcuts. And the thing about fatigue, well it makes cowards out of us all. (phone ringing) - G'day H. - [H] Big game today, you ready? - Yeah, I'm ready. - Well, you better be because the Cowboys are sending down a scout to watch- - Are they interested? - Well I called every club, but Greenie was the only one that called back. - Okay, well good. - It's never too late, all right, you've just got to want it like your life depends on it and play consistent. - Consistent. - That's right, and when it's tough out there on the field I want you to think of your mother and how tough she had it. - I got it H, you coming down? - I get too nervous, you know that, but I'll be listening at the usual. (soft music) (water rushing) - [Mary] You're gonna be late for the game. - There's plenty of time, Mum. - I found your jersey in the wash, pretty interesting perfume. That was your old man's old trick. - Pray we win. - I'll pray you do your best, and that God gives you what you need, not what you want. - Love you. - Go on. (horn honking) - Let's go people, let's go, lock out starts in one minute. Get your butt into gear, move it! How was it? - Yeah so good, so good. - Hey Rhys, can you at least pretend to care about my audition? - Babe, I care. - Rhys, babe, babe just ugh, listen I don't want to have to be the girlfriend to bring this up okay but, you promised we'd be engaged by now. - Yes babe, but that's why I'm saving up for that car we've always wanted. - Yeah, the car you've always wanted. - Baby, it's game day, okay? - Okay, but were talking about me moving in after, okay? You did not tell me Chase was coming. - Would you have done a quickie if I did? - When's it not a quickie with you? - So, how much did you see? - About this much, but I left before the old psh, blowhole. (laughing) - Bro, that's the best part. You know a lot of people would pay good money to see that, to see all this. - All what? How much they pay for a one minute show? And that's if you do it twice. - You know game day sex, that's my thing. Maybe, you know, you should try it some time, because you might get your fire back. - Now don't start, all right. Let me focus, okay? - Focus as much as you want bro, but you ain't gonna win anytime soon. Unlike us, five years in a row baby, no shame. Soon to be six. What do you do for a drowning Comets player? Nothing, you drag em to shore and they're still going to choke anyway. (upbeat music) - [Female Reporter] Now there's been a DeLorean spotted around Wagga, which can only mean one thing. That's right, Mr Hollywood himself and the owner of the Comets, Sam Low is back in town. - [Male Reporter] Oh my gosh. - Yes, he is. - [Male Reporter] Sam the man, this should be good. Maybe he's back in town to see the Comets finish last for another year. - [Female Reporter] You'll see, the Comets will win this year. - [Male Reporter] Your delusional but okay, tell me why they're going to win. - [Female Reporter] Chase Daylight. - [Male Reporter] Daylight who? Didn't every NRL club like want him, and now they don't? The guys a myth, he's gone. Look, if he hasn't made it by now, he's not gonna make it. (Chase sighs) - Surprise. - Hey. - Hey. (Laughing) - Didn't think you were coming. - Nice hello. (Laughs) Considering I've got an assignment and I'm missing work to be here. - I didn't ask you to miss work. - I know you didn't. - Sorry, that came out wrong. - It's okay, yeah. Did you go out last night? - Yeah, but I asked you to come. - I know you did, but I said you get edgy when you're tired. And you didn't listen to me, you never do, you just do what you want. - Can we not do this now? I got a game to play. - Okay go, go play. Yeah, I'll talk to you later I guess. (somber music) (upbeat music) - [Chase] Hey. - Ah, there he is. - Chase. - Hey. Boys. - Chase. (toilet flushes) - Did you bar Lulu last night? Bro that chick's crazy, trust me I know. Beef don't look so desperate, bro. - All right, now that everyone's finally decided to turn up, let's get our head in the game. Right, we've had a pretty good pre-season. You've all trained real hard, but it will mean nothing if you don't take it out on that field. Now Beefa, Mozz is your man. How do you stop him? - I don't know. - I got you Beef. You see when Mozz is running at you mate, you look at his face, you look him dead in the eyes, you reach down to the field, you pick up a bit of shit and throw it right in his face, mate. (laughing) - There's no shit on the field. - When Mozz is running at you, there will be. (laughing) - All right, all right, let's show the fans and especially those people that have written us off that this is our year, the year of the Comets. Bring it in. - Come on Chase, big game boys. All right boys, massive game all right. Put your hands in, let's get in there, let's do it for the team, hey! On three, Comets. One, two, three, Comets! - [Commentator] We're moments from kick off as last year's wooden spooners, the Comets, take on premiers, the Stingrays. Disappointing crowd but the Comets haven't had much to cheer about for a long time. - Coach. - What? - Sam Low. - Ugh for crying out loud, it's for coaches only. I mean I don't tell him how to act. Not that you call "Bold and the Beautiful" acting. - Someone say "Bold and the Beautiful"? Actually, it was "Days of Our Lives", I mean both quality shows that stood the test of time. (whistle blows) - [Commentator] The kick-off is underway and it's taken by Chase Daylight. He takes a strong charge, ugh, but you wouldn't believe it. - Hold the ball! - What's he doing, he's had a brain explosion. (upbeat music) - Heard your girl's on the lookout, bit unsatisfied. Give her my number, would ya? - [Commentator] Now there's a brouhaha. Daylight's losing it. - Thought I'd come here to talk to the team, do you think the boys would like that? Of course, they would. I mean, mark my words, the Comets are going to win this competition and rugby league is gonna be the number one code again in Wagga. - Thanks for your support, Sam. - [Commentary] A glorious day here at gummy gummy for the first round of the AFL season. The Hawks up against the Diamonds, but here is what the crowd came to see. Last year's MVP Reese Stuart looking fit and rearing to go in the number nine. And doesn't he love it? - What? (whistle blows) Hold the ball! (siren blares) - Clap 'em off boys. - [Commentator] Once again, the Comets have come up with duck eggs. - Making the same mistakes as last year and getting the same results, a big fat loss! Everything we practiced, we threw out the window! They pulled our pants down today boys and not in a good way! There will be changes next week! (door slams) - How important was it to get off to a good start, considering let's be honest, last year's abysmal effort? - Actually, we all as a group got together and, took a vote and I don't know, We wouldn't go for the wooden spoon this year, you know? - Well, there you have it. I'm Kev Mcosker, original news. (upbeat music) (humming) - Hey Dee, Rev will be out soon. - How'd you go? - Ugh. - It's just a game. - More than that to some. When you going to come watch? - You asking me out? - No. - It sounded like you were asking me out. - What, I was not asking you out. - Why else would you want me to come watch? - Well, I don't know- - Footy's for losers. (laughing) I'm kidding. The thought that not every girl in Wagga wants you. (sighs) Dad says to never date a footballer, never. - What, the Rev says that? - No, but I reckon he thinks it. - Chicks. - Yeah nice game numb nuts, one of ya best. Loser. - I'll see you. - Yeah, tomorrow. Thanks and thank you again. - Not sure you should be thanking me, I mean, could they have played any worse though? - Hey! - Chase, Chase, Chase! He's my boss. (Randall groaning) He let me off work, he insisted I come and support you. - I don't know what to say. - Maybe just say sorry. - I am so sorry. - You're lucky I don't call the cops mate. Thanks for the coffee, Brooke. - That's me new bag. Bit of a sook, don't you think? - What, do you think it's funny? - It was a little bit funny. But, I though he was hitting on you! I walk up the steps and your talking to a guy, how do I know I can trust you? - Great. (engine starts) - Brooke! Hey! (sighs) Idiot. (soft music) - [Brooke] And you don't listen to me, you never do. You just do what you want. Yeah, it's always a mistake with you. Do you even want to be with me? Just me? - Car stuffed, mate? Come on, let's go for a walk. - [Chase] Do you and your wife ever fight? - We have our moments. - Moments I can handle. - Look, having a barney's not a bad thing. You know if handled correctly you can bring yourselves closer. - Well how do you handle it? - Well I usually stuff it up, but on a good day I admit my part in it, I swallow my pride, I'm glad I married a wife that forgives. Prayer helps. - This one's beyond prayer. - Nothing's beyond prayer, Chase. - Nice try Rev. Mum's been on my case for years, but I believe. - Maybe God wants more. All right, Chase, you had a shocker mate. - Thanks, Rev. - No worries. - Aye there he is, there he is. What's happening, baby? - What's up? - Bro, you look like crap. It's just a game, it's not the end of the world. - Brooke, she... - Oh, yeah. I'm sorry, hey. - You know what, I can't be here, bro. I better go. - Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, - I can't give up on it, you know what I mean? I got to talk to her. - I understand that but just chill out. Bro, she's a woman. You can't change her mind right now, you just need to take it easy, chill out and let's have a few drinks, I got you, bro. - Thanks, brother. (Rhys sighs) - To better days. - Couldn't get any worse. - Speaking of better days, ladies. - [Woman] Hey, hi. - This is my boy Chase, they call him big Chase because he's got a really big heart. (women laughing) - Has it been broken? - Well, we know how to fix that. You know, I've always had a thing for footballers. - What a coincidence, 'cause I've always had a thing for girls that like footballers. (laughing) - Ladies, can you excuse us for just one second? - What are you doing? - I can't do this. What about Sophie? - We have an understanding, the more she doesn't know, the more she understands. (laughing) - One minute, please. - Oh, sorry ladies. His mum, she's really sick. - Oh, really? - He looks after her, four shots please. - [Voicemail] Hey, it's Brooke leave a message, I'll call you back. - Hey babe, it's me. Can you just, just call me back, okay? We need to talk. All right, bye. - Well, how's your mum? - She's, she's fine. - Cheers. - Cheers. (upbeat music) - [Voicemail] Hey this is Chase, leave a message and I'll get back to ya, cheers. - Hey, I'm coming over. (knocking) - It's a pretty familiar story in this house, unfortunately. His dad set a very ordinary example when he left. Let us both down, but that's no excuse. (sighs) - I just, I really love him. I just, I don't know what to do. - I stayed, I put up with it. I was so blind desperate for Chase to have a dad, even if it was someone who wasn't very good to us. - That would have been so hard. (somber music) - If you don't trust Chase, know what you deserve, go find it. Don't settle for anything less. I'll pray for you. - It's okay. I'm going to go find him. Thank you, Mary. (Leona laughing) - [Chase] Whoa. (laughing) - Rhys? ♪ Who are you ♪ ♪ Who are you playing for ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Who are you ♪ ♪ Who are you playing ♪ - Brooke! Brooke. Brooke! - Hey, I called and you didn't answer! - Don't you dare blame this on me! - Who's that? - You hungry, brother? (upbeat music) Thought I'd catch you something before the five o'clock wave. (groans) It's hard to go anywhere without being recognized. - Sorry mate, she might of recognized you if one of your films had got a release. - Please, laugh all you want, but this acting career has taken me all over the world to places that haven't even heard of, aerial Ping-Pong. - All right, fair point, but you are far more likely to get up a beach volley ball comp in the arctic then you are to make rugby league the number one code in the fair city of Wagga. - Oh, please, please. When people talk of this great town, the first thing they say is Peter Sterling, The Mortimer brothers, Eric Whisell. - Terry Daniher, Jeff Kingston, Billy Moore. - Greg Brentnall, Steve Munn, Arther Salmon. - Cam Mooney, Paul Kelly, Wayne Kerry, The Ducks. Should I go on? - You'll see, the Comets will win this year. - They have been wooden spooners for four years. - I didn't get to the top by listening to statistics. - Mate, you didn't get to the middle. - I bet you the Comets will finish ahead of where the Hawks end up. (Warren laughing) - Is this a wager? (Sam groans) - I couldn't take money from family. - Fair enough, the loser has to run around town, in the nude. (upbeat music) - I believe we have a deal, brother. (upbeat music) (phone vibrating) (phone vibrating) (Rhys humming) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) - Bro, she'll come back to you. If not, you know, there's plenty more fish in the sea and I just feel like fishing. (engine blows) (Chase yelling) Oh, my gosh. - Talk about this later. (coughs) Ah I'm so sorry, baby. Oi sexual chocolate, come have a look, will ya? - I wouldn't have a clue. - But you love cars. - Ah I love driving them, not fixing them. - Chill, bro. (horn honks) (Chase groans) (horn honks) - Is it working? - No! - Hosaih, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Naomh and Habocup. - Very good, Louise. (horn honking) I'm gonna go checkout what that horns about. Yeah, keep it going that's very, very good. - Should I start from the top? - [Rev] Yeah, why not? (horn honking) - Shut up! - What about now? - Chase, Chase, if you wanted to come to church mate you could of just knocked. - Sorry about the noise, Rev. - That's all right mate, have you been praying for a sign or something? - That's Rhys. - Hey Rhys, my daughter Dee. Hey Dee, why don't you check it out? - Dee knows her stuff. - Yeah, I taught her everything she knows. I used to steal them before the big fella got a hold of me. Still do one every now and then when offerings are low. - So, Dee, (laughing) what a coincidence that we met like this, like our car broke down at your church, maybe it's a sign. Maybe its destiny, maybe we should meet up sometime. - I don't really go out with strangers. - You've never heard about me? - Should I have? - Yeah. - No. - We've got a gathering inside if you want to pop in. Look, if you don't like it, I won't hassle ya. - I would, Rev, but I've got that with me. - Hey Rhys, want to come inside? Have a bit of a feed, read a bit of the bible? - You going to be there? - Mm-hmm. - Well then, hell yeah. I mean, yeah hallelujah, praise the lord, let's go. - So, you'd go out with someone who's saving sex for marriage? Its stuffed, it needs to cool down. It's not the only thing. - Come on in, fellas. Okay everyone, this is Chase and Rhys. - Now that they're here, should we lock the door? - She's kidding. - But we will need to strip you for our initiation. - That's true. - Funny. Just for the record, I have no problems with nudity. - Great. - Right, now that everyone's seated. Let's start by getting to know each other a little better. Here's a question, what excites you? - God. - Nice one, Louise. Can anyone else or anything else, other than God? - The Bible. - Chase? - Traveling, I like traveling. - I just got back from traveling. - You went to Titty Bong, it's like a five-hour drive. - It's still traveling. - Look, in Estelle's defense, Titty Bong is actually a very, very nice place. Anyone else? - I get excited about diversity. - Hmm. - I mean, don't you think it's amazing that there are a billion girls in the world yet every single one of them are different? Like that just blows my mind. - Says a lot about God's creativity, don't you think? - I don't really like to think about God and girls at the same time but, by the way, how did you even score your misses because I don't see a guide dog anywhere. - Well let's just say, some people are a little bit deeper. You know, not too much into looks. - Well I just hope God doesn't hold it against the blessed ones. (chuckles) (bell ringing) - That'll be the pizza. (upbeat music) - Relationships, families it's always hard mate, especially for blokes like us, you know we've never had a dad on the scene. And we have to toy a little bit harder to have a happy relationship, because we never saw it work at home. - There was no middle ground with dad, he was either yelling and slamming doors or out the door. - Yeah. Just hang in there, this is a good step. Everyone here, we're here for you. Okay, can we all take our seats? Let's end in prayer. Now who would like to lead us? (Rhys clears throat) - I will. Thanks God, for loving everyone, even really weird people. - And God, we're sorry when we blow it, but thanks for looking past our actions, for giving us, sticking by us, and loving us for who we are. Help us to accept that love and trust you. For those of you that want to get closer, God sees your heart. - Amen. - [All] Amen. - Amen. What? - I seen you in there, you were digging it. I mean, I just can't imagine you being like, one of them. - You do you, okay? - Well at least you get to sleep with multiple wives, aye? - Pretty sure that's a different faith, mate. - Oh yeah, well no sex before marriage. (laughing) You're stuffed, mate. A little hallelujah is all good, but just don't change. (upbeat music) - Amen, man. - [Tom] So she's playing with my nipples, right? - Why the nipples? - Because the nipples are an erogenous zone, okay? - Interesting. - Anyway, she's playing with my nipples, and it's starting to hurt, boys. Truth be told, it's probably a little bit too hard, but who am I to judge? Because there's a fine line between a nipple massage and a nipple cripple. Remember that Beefa for next time you're playing with your dog's nipples, all right? (laughing) - Okay, I only did that once to fluffy, all right? - Oh yeah, righto. - Oh, cheer up Beefa you big bloody sook, look, I'll make it up to you, all right? How about this weekend we go out and you's can all run off me, ay? - [Team] Yeah! - Better yet, Chase can come and we can run off him. There's always good sorts hanging around him, are we in? - [Team] Yeah! - You in, Chase? - I can't. - Why? - Well I got church the next day. - [Tom] Are you being serious? - Well I mean I got a wedding at the church. - Sounds good, right. If we don't want another flogging like we did last weekend, can I strongly suggest, I don't know, playing better? I said there would be a few changes and here they go. Tucker, Pricey you're on which means Bird, Daylight, you're on the bench, all right? Hit the showers. Daylight. - Stay strong, brother. - Look mate, I know it's hard, but if I don't start with the best then the rest follow suit we're wooden spooners again. - Yeah, but coach- - I need you to do what's right for the team. (soft music) - Chase, don't worry about it man, keep your head up, all right? Everyone's got bad days mate, you'll bounce back, trust me. - Cheers Tommy, it's good to have mates like you. - Stay strong, man. (chase grunts) - Ow, come on mate. It's just a little golden shower, mate. Everyone's doing it. Hey, Beefa. (relaxing music) - You got any chiko rolls yet, Kin? Look, I am your best customer, I'm your only bloody customer. If you want people back in, get the chiko rolls. - But chiko rolls are made in Bathurst, not Wagga. - No here, Wagga Wagga, a place so nice they named it twice. - I'll ask Kwon. - [Commentator] And we are now moments away from the second match of the season as the Comets take on the- - Great chiko rolls, state of origin calls in. - He said, if you want a chiko roll go to his home town where it came from, Bendigo. - Can you remind Kwon, that the Chiko roll was first sold at the Wagga Wagga show in 1951? - You want me to tell him again? - I'll just get the usual. - Very good, Mr Harry. - [Commentator] Another loss, and to put it bluntly the Comets are- - Get it, Amy. (somber music) - What happened? - I just gave away too many stupid penalties. - And what would you put that down to? - Stupidity. - Still, without that last try it would have been a draw, not a bad result. - I got mixed feelings about draw's Kev. It's like watching your mother in law drive off a cliff in your new car. - [Commentator] And Daylight once again is on the bench. It seems like only yesterday that the NRL club were chasing him. What a waste of talent, this kid could have been anything. - Now everyone here has their story, and what I've learnt as I've gotten to know myself is that it was more of a cry for attention, you know, I just wanted to feel important, valued. - G'day. - You've got a lot of nerve showing up here. - Yeah, but Mr Johnson- - Look, she doesn't want to see you. - [Commentator] This is happening just far too often, and look at Daylight, he can't even get on the paddock, he is one unhappy camper. - Now I learnt a lot of hard truths along the way. They weren't easy to hear, especially when they come from the ones you love. Sometimes I thought I was going backwards. - [Commentator] To be fair, that was a gutsy effort, but in this game if you don't have confidence and leadership, you can't win. - Hopeless, hopeless. - I look down at my wife and daughter and how close I came to losing them forever. I'm glad I pushed through. - [Commentator] Coach Munsey's filthy. Look, I'm a good mate of his, we drink at the same pub, we even dated the same girl, but I digress. If he still thinks they can win the comp, he is off his head. Well, Daylight can pray all he likes, but it ain't going to help the Comets. Switching codes, the Hawks continue their dream run with Rhys Stuart on fire. - Hey. - Hey. - [Beefa] How's it going? - Tom. - Yo. - Liam Door from the Cowboys. - Hey, how are you, nice to meet you. - Good to meet you too, you've been doing some good things out there. - Thanks. - But I'm a bit worried about your defense. - That's because I don't like to tackle, so just put me on the wing and I'll be all right. - I don't know Rev, it's just, it's getting hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. - Your times coming, mate. - I wish I had your confidence. Now I don't want to sound like I'm whingeing or anything, but ever since I decided to follow, things have gotten worse. - Hey, don't shoot the messenger. - But think about it, my career's in the toilet. I see other dudes get approached by scouts all the time. - Mate, I know it's tough and look I know how much this means to you and I know, look, sometimes the way that things work out isn't the way we imagined, but he knows what he's doing, even if we don't know what he's doing. - It's not just the footy, it's Brooke. You know the way I treated her. - You can't live with regret, right, we all stuff up. Have you tried to talk to her? If you love her enough you've got to let her go. Look, if it comes back maybe you'll both be in a better place. - Or I could lose her forever. - Well, that is a possibility. - Why do I feel like you've lead me down the garden path? - Yeah, you're not the first person who's told me that and I don't think you'll be the last. How you feeling on the inside? - Well honestly, better. - Good. Look, hey. Chase, you need to give yourself some time out. Mate, it's not all about sex, yeah, it's about intimacy. You need to get to know the girl's heart, okay? It's easier to bare your ass than to bare your soul. Faith, relationships, they're a marathon, not a sprint. - How's Dee, mate? - Good. - What's she up to tonight? - Oh, mate she's doing that thing called none of your business. - One more, it's on him. - Hey, I saw Brooke out the other night. Bro, she was looking oh. Just kidding man, hashtag not kidding. - We're sort of taking a break, you know? - So you're saying I could of- - Shut up. - I'm only joking. So, who you seeing now then? - No one. - Bro look at me, we've been mates for a long time, you've never had a dry spell this long. Who are you seeing? - I started going to church. - That club out the back of... - No. - Oh, you haven't gone all churchy on me. No, no. - Look it's not just about church, it's about your relationship with God. - What about it? - I want to follow him. - Where? - Well I don't know, anywhere he wants to take me. - Hang on stop, stop. Are you being serious with me right now? - Yeah, I'm being serious, I'm really serious, I am. - Remember my cousin Bella, remember the 22-year-old one, sexy, you know we used to, nice body, nice hair? Right, well get this. She's saving it for marriage, she hasn't, she's never been, you know what I mean? She's crazy, she's lost it. - That's why she turned me down they, ay? - Hey, you never talk about my family like that, all right? Only I can talk about my family like that, all right? - I'm sorry. - It's all good, bro. - Look just, just do me a favor, yeah? Just keep it under your hat. - Bro, trust me I will not say a word, all right? We've been teammates for a very, very, very long time. And I love ya all right? Okay, trust me. - Love you, man. - Love you too, bro. - Boys, bring it in, bring it in. Chase has got something to tell everyone, come on. Bring it in, turn around, come on eyes up Beef, eyes up. Tell 'em, Chase. - I've decided to follow God. - Where? - Beef, not yet mate, don't ask stupid questions. Mate, I like where you're going, but it's not the best bit. Go on, tell 'em Chase, tell 'em. - I'm... - He's saving it for marriage, he's not gonna do it until he gets married. (laughing) He's saving it for marriage. (laughing) Why you laughing Beef, at least he's got a choice in it. You've got no choice in your life. - Oh. - Oh, I'm only joking, Beef. - Your cold as ice Tom, you know that. - Beef, I'm only joking. I'm only joking. I'm only joking, it's footy! - Get away! - It's footy! - Get away from me! - This is what we do, it's footy! (screams) It's footy, Beefa! (laughing) (upbeat music) - In the world of sports, scandals are not uncommon and here's a whopper. (dramatic music) (farting) - Poor bastard. - What the! - Ugh. - Oh, your tense. - What? (calm music) - [Commentator] He's done it, he's scored. (phone dings) (phone dings) (phone dings) (phone dings) (sirens wailing) (upbeat music) - Oh bro, you remember her? Remember that night we had, I think she wanted me, I could never be with a DJ, she would be too erotic for me. Oi, bro. Did you hear me, she would be too erotic. - I think you mean erratic. - Yeah, that too. - Plus, you're with Sophie. (Rhys sighs) - You know she bought up the whole proposal thing the other day, but why buy the cow when we can get the milk for free? (upbeat music) - Thought you were going to ignore me all night. (laughing) - Oh shoot, sorry. - Okay close your eyes and don't open them until I say. Stop. Okay. Now. (soft music) So, tell me about this girl that's got to you. I've been there, a few times. Till I worked this relationship thing out. - You worked it out? - Just got to realize that if you don't really care, you can't really get hurt. - Does that really work for you? - Well, don't hold out on me. Come on man, give me the juice. - Honestly, she was, nothing happened. - Nothing happened? I can still smell her on you, you little horn dog. You've always been one, you always will be. Plus, you can't argue with science, bro. - What are you jabbering about? - We're not wired for monogamy. - All right look, obviously I wanted to. She was... - Oh amen, hallelujah. - But I didn't it just felt wrong you know, I can't explain it. - Oh please, look at the animal kingdom, bro. You know of the five thousand species of mammals, did you know only 5% max, that's max, will form lifelong bonds. - Okay Moufassa, that's enough now, you can be quiet. - 5% bro, that's not you. - Where do you get this stuff? I mean really, you didn't even finish school. - Well you know I make it my business to know, bro. - Oh, look no offense, I love you, but I'm not taking relationship advice from you. - Whoa, first of all that hurt. Second of all, I am a great lover. - Is that why you and Sophie are so happy? - Oh, so it's like that? No, that's sweet bro, fine. Just so you know don't tell me how you're gonna change, you want to change, but then you go and sleep with a hot DJ. - I did not have sex. - No, no, no, no. Actually, I, nah, I don't want to hear it all. I don't want to hear about your faith, I don't want to hear about Brooke, nothing. It's all good, we good, we good.

G'day, Binnie. He's a marker, if I tap him on the right cheek which way's he gonna move, Beefa? - Ooh, left?

Rhys! I am leaving, okay, I am going home. - What did I do? (somber music) - Many of you know my past, it's a bit shady to say the least. I pretty much ticked all the boxes of being a bad boy. You name it, I did it. Psychiatrists had written me off, irreparable damage to my brain. My wife wont attest to that, but God doesn't look to the past when he sees us. He looks at our future and what it can be, the possibilities, because he values us. - Are you okay? - [Rev] And we all want value. - Yeah, I just, I don't know what I'm doing here. - Its' all right. - It's okay, you stay, I'm gonna go. - Well, it hurts. - [Brooke] I know you can't see it, but it will be good for us. - Not for me. - [Brooke] For me then. - Just tell me what I can do to make it up to you. - Remember when we met and you told me about how your dad left after he cheated on your mum? And he'd come back. She'd take him back again and then he'd do it again. - I was there. - Yeah, I know. You didn't deserve it. Your mum didn't deserve it. Neither do I. (soft somber music) - Where's Rhys? - At his girlfriends. - You okay? You other friend left in a hurry. - Brooke, my ex-girlfriend, she had to go. Can't blame her, only so much one person can take. - You know, dad didn't kick his drug habit for a long time. I remember him screaming at my mum in the middle of the night completely off his face. It was full on, but look at him now. Mum did have to kick him out twice, until he proved that he was serious about changing. - We had a similar childhood. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Didn't realize the Rev had such a colorful life. - I know right, didn't mind a party, the old Rev. Just quietly, I still catch him having the odd bong every now and then. - Really? - No. - I shouldn't. - Hey, listen, sometimes the big fella closes the door because he has another plan, so just hang in there. - Thanks, coach. - Anytime, just call me, text me, 24/7 that's me. (upbeat music) - [Sophie] You are not leaving me right now. No, I swear to god if you walk out, Rhys! I'm leaving okay, I'm going home. - [Kev] Rhys Stuart. - Yeah, I don't understand it Kev, I mean, the kid is consistently brilliant. He's the type of bloke who gets up at six o'clock in the morning regardless of what time it is, but something's going on, I mean he was not good. - Well you heard it, six o'clock in the morning everyday. Switching codes in the news doesn't get any, I think your still in shot. - Oh sorry, sorry. - I'll just pick it up again. (audience cheering) - [Commentator] There goes Daylight, he's through! That's more like it, this kid can play. Pinch me, I'm dreaming. - Go boys! (bell dings) (phone ringing) - Hello, is this the world-renowned actor Sam Low? With four illustrious Razzi awards? - It was four nominations, but I only one won. (Warren laughs) Oh, you! - Hello, little brother. Hey, I've got a favor to ask you. - [Sam] Why should I help you out? - Well it's not for me, one of our players, Rhys Stuart. - He's a Kiwi, he should be learning the Haka and using those thunder thighs to pump up players left, right and center. - Mate, he is a star. - He wouldn't cut it in league anyway. - Hey, you and I both know that AFL players are far fitter. You wouldn't see a leagie running 15Ks in a game. - Try running 10 meters with four players on your back! - Try going for a mark getting elbows in your face. - It's easy to jump if you're wearing a singlet, I mean singlets were made for frolicking down at the beach. - I am 45, I've got a dickie knee and I've had a triple bypass and I could still play a full game of league. - See ya later, big brother. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Its Rhys' girl, he's, she's, she's an actor blah, blah, blah. She wants to run some lines with you. - What's it to you? - Well, that'd make him happy and when he's happy he plays well so, I'd like to keep him happy. - [Sam] Well, they'll have to come to me, but I'll do it. - Really? - Mm-hm, I'm willing to put our differences aside for a fellow thespian. I bid you sweet adjure my brother. (upbeat country music) - I feel like something deep-fried, Kin. Full of meat, cabbage, celery, barley, rice, onion, carrot, green beans and spices all wrapped up in a lovely roll and dropped in one of your pots of fat. - You no fool me Mr Harry, that's a chiko roll. (Harry laughs) - Just give me the usual, mate. - Right away, Mr Harry. (speaking foreign language) - You hungry? - Nah, I'm good thanks. - Make that two, Kin. (Kin speaking in foreign language) I'm gonna dive straight in here. How am I gonna get you an NRL contract, when you can't make the starting side in a team that's losing everything? - Well it's a bit hard to show what I've got from the bench. - Bloody coach of yours wouldn't know a good footballer if it bit him in the ass. Useful as tits on a bull. Now what's all this talk about God and stuff? Not taking money... - It doesn't work like that. - He's not doing you any favors right now anyway, is he? I've been calling club after club and I'm not even getting a call-back. This is a crucial time for you mate. Now, how bad do you want it? - I want it. - All right, you doing any extras? - Of course. - Well when your opportunity happens and it will, and you're ready for it up here, there'll be no stopping you, mate. All right? Asian spicy, Kin, not Australian spicy. - [Kin] Yes, Mr Harry. (upbeat music) ♪ I hope you'll come back ♪ ♪ I hope ♪ - Oh, okay. (Sighs) Okay, just focus Sophie, one phone call from Sam to any producer or agent. (sighs) My dream. - Hey. - Wait, what are you doing? - I was just trying to be supportive. - No, I meant what I said, okay? We're not getting back together. - Welcome, welcome to my humble abode. - Thank you so much for seeing me today, Mr Low. - Hold on, the name's Sam and the pleasure is all mine. - Oh. - Besides Mr Low makes me sound kind of ancient. So how old do you think I am anyway? - I don't know, mid 30s? - Ha, ha, ha, you almost got me there you cheeky bugger. Shoot us would you, Ronaldo? - Here, you've got to do this for me, okay? No, just do it. - So, I'm Will and you're Millie. - Yep. - And action! Come with me. - I can't believe you still feel this way. - I'm human Millie, here I am willing to let go of everything. - This can't be real. - Touch me, feel me, I am real. - Then take what's yours. - Keep filming Raymond, this is gold! (Sophie gasps) And cut. Put that on YouTube and see how we go. (soft music) (Dee sighs) - Yeah, I don't know. I guess the biggest tests aren't when everything's cruisy. When it's all going your way, when you don't get what you want, it's when life sucks. Yeah, that's faith, sticking it out when you'd rather bail. - I'm proud of you, you know that?

(bell dings) - Great result today boys, great result. So, I'd like to take this opportunity to say that my man of the match- (clears throat) Is... Actually, why don't I take this opportunity to bring in someone who needs no introduction. - Thanks, coach. Recently, I was on set with Jean-Claude Van Damme and I was gonna show Van Damme a little kick that I invented, and in between takes, in between takes I had to stop Jean-Claude and I said, "Jean-Claude, wait! "Stop, I'm too distracted!" 'Cause I'm thinking about you, The Comets. No matter where I am in the world, the Comets are always in my heart. (hesitant clapping) - Man of the match? - Oh!

Outstanding form, you must be very, very excited, but the celibate thing, it must be hard. - Yeah, it gets a bit hard at times you know but- (Kevin laughing) - I'm just messing with you man, just messing, just a bit of... - So why do you think bad stuff happens to good people then? - Do you really want to talk about this? - [Tom] Yes, yeah. - Well I'm still learning but, aye that's my towel! - Pressure, some people eat it, some people get eaten by it, but today for the first time in this team's history we showed why we deserve to be in the finals! - [Team] Yes! - Hands in, loud and proud boys. - Comets! - Aye! - Comets! - Aye! - Comets! - Aye! - [Team] Yeah! - It's a big week for both codes as the Comets seek their first ever title and the Hawks, their sixth consecutive.

(sighs) We're all well aware of how important tomorrow is, not only to us but to our family and friends, this club, our whole town, even that place just outside of town where I get my waxing done. So, I want you to come up with one word that best describes your commitment to this team. - Relentless, because I'm just gonna keep coming at 'em all day, coach. - Good one, Tommy. - Mongrel, we're the toughest guys I know and together we can smash them. - Selfless, do anything for the boys no matter what. - Yeah, the boys. - Photosynthesis. - Where does photosynthesis come into this team, Beefa? - Photosynthesis is the biggest word I know and tomorrow is gonna be the biggest game of my life. Yeah. Yeah. (upbeat music) - Thanks for coming, I know it's a busy week for ya. The Cowboys did put a call-in, Greeny says you've been doing some good stuff, but, it's only his opinion. - He's one of the best in the business. - Even experts can get it wrong. - Thanks for trying H, I mean it. - Hey, you know why I helped out when you were a little tacker, decided to manage you for free, hey? Your mum and her sacrifice. When your dad shot through, she had nothing. She had two jobs she was working, she shopped at St Vinnie's for herself and every cent that she spent was on you. She went the distance because she believed in you. Look, I know what I saw when I saw this little superstar running around the field. Hey, you're a champ and hey, these eyes don't lie. - [Commentator] Now Swayne, for the rugby tackle. Enormous hit, that would've left a mark there and it came from Stevens. Jason Stevens, welcome back to the starting line. (somber music) - Hey Raymond, give my regards to Sophie. - We're gonna write a little bit of history today and we're not writing that history for you, we're writing this history for the town, for those we love, for those we care about. That's who we're playing for today. Rhys, you with us, yeah? - Yeah. - All right, the game plan is this, kick it to Rhys, kick it to Rhys, kick it to Rhys, Rhys, goal. Now this team, this club, we use the corridor. Some teams don't like the corridor, some teams think there are poisonous snakes in the middle of the ground. There are not poisonous snakes in the middle of the ground. We are playing the corridor, straight down the guts, get that ball moving forward, at all times, quick hands, quick hands! Okay boys, bring it in. Now, what are we gonna do? - [Team] Win! - [Warren] What are we going to do? - [Team] Win! - Where are we going to play? The corridor! - [Team] The corridor! - Where we gonna play? - The corridor! - Right, let's get out there! Let's make some history, boys! Let's make some history! - Let's go, let's go! - Come on boys, come on boys, gather round, gather round. Now today's not about who's fitter. It's not who's stronger. Not even about who's smarter, it is about this, it's about your jam tart. And if you do everything you can for each other we'll win this game, I promise you that. Now Chase, you got Becket what's his move? - Right foot step, carries left. - Beefa, Collins. - I'm going to tear him from limb to limb, piece by piece and drink the blood of my enemies. His children are going to cry out screaming, daddy. Daddy! And I'm gonna turn to them and say, Beefa's now your daddy. - I like it, a little bit creepy, but I like it. Tom, you got Palma, what do you do? - Give him straight to daddy. (laughing) - All right boys, bring it in, bring it in. (clapping) - Right boys big game, this is why we're here, hands in, Comets on three, all right? Make some noise! - [All] One, two, three, Comets! (uplifting music) (audience cheering) - You suck, Chase! I'm joking. - [Commentator] The Comets fans have turned out in their droves today to witness their first ever grand final appearance. Can the Comets do it, can they make history? (uplifting music continues) (whistle blows) (audience cheering) Here's the kick off, it goes straight into the waiting arms of Lance who charges at the line but wham, bam, thank you ma'am! Daylight absolutely smashed it! Beat against the wall for the Stingrays, he's made a nice charge. He looks for an offload but is brought down by Thacker in a really solid tackle. The Stingrays go again, this time threw to Beaut, but he's flung to the ground in a football of all tackle. Now they go wide, Peters to Cornell. (audience cheering) Intersected by Beaumont, the Comets are on the gun! Beaumont to Daylight, he's short now but... - Come on! - He charges, his tackle did not hold, he slips it back to Daylight. He's over, he's over! The Comets are in! - Yes! (audience cheering) Kin, did you hear that? If they don't pick him for the NRL their crazy, crazy! - Congratulations! (laughing) - Keep filming Raymond, this is good. - Rhys, come on! Rhys what, what is he doing? Quick hands, come on, come on! (whistle blows) Up! Come on. Come on! Umpire! He's all over him! (whistle blows) Rhys! Righto, get out there, go. Go, do a good job! Bit more torque, tell 'em we want more torque! Sit down. (audience cheering) - [Commentator] Well what a game we've had here and the Stingrays through Taylor and attacked the Comet's side. 16-12 there's only minutes left, now Pitch threw onto Reeno onto Fordum, he's through! Daylights stopping, Daylight strides, he's chasing him. - Tackle him! - [Commentator] He's too late, Fordum's over, the Stingrays are back in this, baby. 16 all with a kick to come. Well Fordum's just given Daylight a gob full and reminded him who the premiers are. - Come on, boys! - [Commentator] Daylight won't give up, but you can see the disappointment in the faces of the Comets supporters. The conversion's good and the Stingrays lead 18-16. Oh, I wonder what coach Munsey's thinking, but knowing Munsey it's probably not much. - Hey, you know why I helped you out when you were a little tacker. Your mum and her sacrifice. She went the distance because she believed in you. - [Commentator] Daylight prepares to get things underway. There's only minutes remaining. The Comets might get one, maybe two more sets to pull a rabbit out of a hat. Let's see what they've got. Murray takes hit up, but Daylight rips the ball in a one on one steal! They've got balls on them, they'll get one more throw of the dice! Thomas onto Mitchell, he double pumps and there's Daylight charging at the line He gets it up, great ball to Beefa. He bursts through, they won't stop him! Beefa is over, he's scored, the Comets win their first ever grand final! The crowd has gone wild, look at Sam Low! It's like he's won an Oscar instead of a Razzi. Can you believe it?! (whistle blows) The Comets have made history, everyone had written them off except themselves. (upbeat music) (audience cheering) (phone ringing) - Richo. - I'm the first to admit that I'm wrong, Harry. Chase Daylight reminds me a lot of a young Jason Stevens. Except he's a lot fitter and he doesn't have a face like a smashed in pie. (upbeat music) (audience cheering) - Well done. - Thank you, Rev. - It was all over and I was just standing there like an idiot filming. Just so yuck. You know what the worst part was? Just knowing that, you know, she's not mine to hold anymore. (Chase sighs) - I'm sorry you had to go through that, mate. - Look, I'm sorry about before, aye. - [Chase] Eh, don't worry about it. - I'm gonna do all I can to get her back. Might even change my ways. I mean, I'm not going to become like celestial or anything like that. - I think you mean celibate. - Yeah, yeah. (sighs) I will need your help to keep on track. (upbeat music) - So, you really gonna make me go through with this? - Mm-hmm. (upbeat music) (laughing) - Happy? - Mm-hmm. You really don't like my work? - I think you're the most underrated actor on the world stage today. - Hmm. - And deservedly so. - This town, the players love you. All I ever wanted was for you to be proud of me. - Same. Here I am, devoid of my earthly robes, reminded that life is short and I have nothing to lose. Why? 'Cause, I'm naked already. - Hmm, touching words. - Yeah, it's from that flick of yours, the Puerto Rican. - You saw "Down Out Puerto Rico"? (laughing) - Yeah, it was a good flick. - I never knew you saw any of my films. - Aw, just all of them. - Well, so ready to go for a run? - I'm gonna walk it. - Walk? - Mm-hmm. - What? Hold on.

(screams) - And I visited Brooke again. She was great. She took the time to hear me out and we got closure about the whole thing. And Richo came good on that NRL contract, guess I got the dream after all. - You're a bit dressed up to be doing the washing. - I'm going to see the Rev. - Just the Rev? - [Chase] Oh, and one other thing I- - Easy mate. - [Chase] I kind of fell for the Rev's daughter. Yep, the girl who helped me get on track became the girl of my dreams. - Comets, yeah. - [Chase] She did take some convincing though, but in the end, Dee and I got hitched. - [Kev] You know, they reckon the sound from the honeymoon sweet was the closest Wagga ever got to an earthquake. - Why would anyone even honeymoon in Wagga? - I don't know man, it's just a joke.
