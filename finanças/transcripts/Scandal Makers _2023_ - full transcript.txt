Karin called. Write it down, Karin called. Kar, Karin called. Karin called. Friends of Familia, this next called is very special. You must be familiar with her name. Karin Kurnia. - Hello, Karin.- Hello. Finally, we are happy to hear your voice live. We have been reading the letters from you. Friends of Familia, you must be very curious to hear from Karin. How are you doing? Please tell us about your father. Yes. - Congratulations, Karin.- I know his address. Good for you, congratulations. I am happy to hear that. Why don't you meet him? Actually, I'm scared. Scared, why? Please tell us about it. Maybe I and other Familia listeners can help you out. What if he doesn't acknowledge me? That is natural. He will be shocked when he sees you. But do you remember what I told you three months ago? When you sent your first letter to us? You can say "ex wife" but please remember. There will never be "ex child". - Yes, thank you. - Okay, good. Karin, how is your child doing? Will he come along? - Yes, he will come. - Good, Karin. Good. Let me tell you, Gempa is the key. Your father will be delighted to see his grandson. Don't be surprised to see Gempa sleepwalks. And sometimes he pees just about anywhere. Whoa. Gempa is funny. Adorable. What if my dad doesn't like him? If he doesn't, you should try to slowly win his heart. You could make him help around the house. Or maybe, cook him breakfast. I am not good at cooking. I don't know any parent or a father... ...who have the heart to refuse their children's cooking. They will eat it, whether it's tasty or not. Trust me on this. I will do an event with dad. Wait, wait. Can you sing? This is fabulous. The Familia audience must be curious about your voice. I can advise you this. Join the Reaching For The Stars singing competition. - Isn't that right, Familia friends?- Okay, I will try. Yes, I will wait for it. Yes. I am sure that in our next programme, the meeting between you and your dad... ...will be spectacular and sensational. It will be an inspiration to some parents. - Trust Oskar on this.- Thank you. I can't believe his luck. He suddenly win a jackpot. He gets a daughter and a grandson. Damn! What a lucky guy. It might happen to you too. Me? It will never happen. I'm professional. Come on, just focus on my work. What's the agenda for today? Endorse. - And that means. - Money. Action! Vitahat. Makes our body strong and healthy. Like martial artists. And cut! Nice! Let's take a break, guys. How is it? Is it good? That last take is good, Kar. But... I told you, I don't like to shoot with kids. They're complicated. And I don't like you as an ad director. Just look at this video. Bro, with we are totally into this, there will be more clients for you. - Profit, profit. - Okay. Hear any news about "that" guy? - "That" guy? Who? - Syahrul. I don't know you care about the rumors. I know, you want to see the video about him and the girl. Yes, I'm curious about it. What if that video gets more Likes than ours? I know you, bro. - You dirty man. - Damn you. I will tell Sanusi, he will make it a news. Just tell him, I'm not afraid. Don't make me do it. He is an old timer. Oskar Pambudi. Sanusi. We are just talking about you. We are just talking about how good you are now. Kar, I respect the persons who have great fighting spirit. You were down but now you rise again. That's great. Why so serious? - No, I'm not. - Just relax. We are talking about you, how great you are. How did you manage to get that Syahrul video? I am thinking what if I publish that video... - Syahrul will kill me if I publish the video. - That is dangerous. It is very risky indeed but you need some money to get married, right? How do you know I'm getting married? You're not the only one who can get the rumors. Everybody knows you're getting married. And how about you, when are you getting married? Me? Not in the near future. It's complicated. I want to have a child who grows instantly. I don't want to rear a child. I want him to work immediately. He can work for me then. What about the girl from the cooking show? Who? Yes, Julia. What about her? - Which Julia? - Julia, the cooking utensils show host. The girl with the short bangs. - No, there is none. - Don't lie to me. No, there is none. You're insane. You have the wrong information. You got the wrong information, Sanusi. Excuse me, I don't feel well. This is insane. - Julia, Julia who? - You lie. Silly boy! Hi, Julia my love. Hi, dear. Where are you, Julia? Just relax, baby. Just wait for me, okay. If you wait for me too, I will. Gosh, you always know what to say. See you. Yes, baby. I will. Wow, so quick. Maybe she rides a jetplane. Hi, baby. Who are you? Karin. I'm Gempa. Karin who? You get the wrong address. Karin Kurnia. Karin Kurnia? The girl in the Karin story? The girl who called to Familia radio? Oh my. What are you doing here? Your house is around here too? Yes, the address is here. Really? Which house? This house. You are my father. This must be a prank. Where's the camera? Which TV station are you from? What kind of prank is this? Karenina is my mother. Are you sure you don't know her? - Does it really matter if I know her. - Of course it does. What does it have to do with me? You were at the 9th grade at Rejosari Junior High She was your first love and your first experience too. Familia friends, just like Karin Kurnia, I was once lived in Rejosari. My grandfather was born there. Karenina Kurnia, your first love and your first experience too. You lost your virginity and I was born nine months. You have to try to find your father. Your father has to be responsible for your life. Oh my God. This is impossible. It is possible. I am the proof. Mom doesn't want to bother you. She raised me by herself. And she told me one year ago before she died. That is why I decided to find you here now, dad. Gempa, go sit with your grandpa. - Grandpa. - Whoa, stop, take him. Oh my, Julia. Let's play. One moment, dear. Whatever happens, don't go out of this room. That goes for him too. Don't be noisy. But Gempa wants to pee. Just pee there, it's not that difficult. - Hi, Julia. - Hi, baby. It's so unusual for you to lock the door. I have to wait so long, dear. I want to give you a surprise. - Oh my God. - Just for you. Are you preparing another surprise for me? You are so kind. What is the surprise? Is somebody here? I hear a sound. No, it's my music player. It's automatic. - I just bought it this morning. - That's cool. Now close your eyes. That is interesting. What is wrong honey? Open your eyes. Let's breakup. Why does the guest leave so soon? - Have you eaten, dad? - Don't call me dad. - Papa? - No. - Papi? - No. - Abi? - Abi, Abe, Aba, Abu, whatever it is, it's a no! Who told you to eat? Why do you make a scene? I don't want to go. If you want to, just go, dad. What? This is my house. Why do you tell me what to do? You said it yourself, that you have the heart to tell your child to go away. You also said that there is "ex wife" but not "ex child". There is no way I have a child of your age. And also, if high school kid... ...did it... There's maybe a one percent chance for it to happen. Just look at me. I was pregnant when I was at 9th grade. Crazy. The point is, I don't allow you to stay here. If you insist, I can sue you. I can sue you too with an article about how a father do not acknowledge his child. - Is there such an article? - Yes, there is. Do you have any money to hire a lawyer? So I can't stay here, can I? No. Get out. Gem. Come on, let's go. Don't forget to close the door. What is this? The video of Syahrul scandal is now trending on Twitter. His career is in danger. This is horrible. Adr Karin, what if people knows that you have a daughter and a grandson? Good night, grandpa. It's late. Let's sleep. Let's go. Good morning, grandpa. Oh my! Why is my home turned upside down like this? Why are you making a mess of my kitchen? Who asks you to cook? You told it yourself. Prepare your dad a breakfast to make him touched. Me? That is not a clothes hanger. Are you two terrorists? I have cooked a lot. Please eat it. I have thought about this since last night. I am sure about it. Very sure. You are not my daughter. Don't be so sure. I am sure. Look, your eyes are different from mine. Your eyes are bulging. They look abnormal. They're the same. Look at your nose. It's different from mine. It's the same. You are so annoying. I need a proof. If necessary, let's do a DNA test. I am sure you are not my child. You will be famous if your story is made into a movie. I am already famous. A pet clinic that can conduct a DNA testing. This clinic can not only do DNA testing. It can do cloning as well. Do you want to wait for the test result? It's up to you. I need a hard evidence. A legit proof. Okay. Your band concert was cool. - Really? - You are still cool. Do you like Fantastic band? What is your favorite song? - Hollow Dreams. - Do you hear that? I wrote that song. She is a good flirt. Just like you. Hey, kid, what is your name? Gempa Oskar Putranto. He already got your name in his. How dare you name him Oskar without my permission? Your name should be Gempa Bumi or Gempa Tektonik. My name is in ruins because of this kid. - Okay. - How long does it take? Ten days. At least. Ten days? Not same day? I will die if I have to spend ten days with them. This is horrible. Hey. Excuse me, sir. You don't have to work here for the next two days. I can do it myself. This is your pay. - Thank you sir. - Go, go, go. Don't! She is 100 percent your child. Grandpa! Want some? You can have it. Okay... ...as a man... I will be responsible for you. To take care of you two... ...you have to stay in the village. I will pay for all of your expenses. Living in the city is hard. It is not good for your mental health. Especially for Gempa's development. Hey! Eat! Eat! - Eat. - Are you drunk? Eat. What is the bad thing about me? There is only one bad thing about me. When I was pregnant at school. That's all. I want you to know, dad.. That I want to be a singer. That's it! I want to be famous. That's good! Great. Have some more. Dad. I have decided. That I will stay here for only a month. Why? You are my daughter. This house is yours too. You can live here for a year, two years, five year... Or as long as you like. It's up to you. Thank you, dad. Guys, the fans are asking about the development of Karin story. - So? - She has never sent us her story anymore. What if we call her back? - No! - Yes. - No, don't. - Why not? Don't. Here's why. The point of my show is that the listeners need us. It'll look like a scripted show if suddenly we call them. It's okay to call them sometimes. Hear this. Our director is starting to complain. Our rating is lower, Kar. He is always complaining. What does he know about the problems? - What is the problem, Kar? - What I mean is... I don't know how you'll do it but we have to get Karin's story. - We have to get our ratings up again. - Yes, right. - Stop saying yes, call her! - Right, call her. - The number is 085. - Are you sure you want to call her now? Boss, how if we wait until tomorrow? - My instinct is telling me about this. - What instinct are you talking about? Here's what I think, I don't know if you can believe it. I think Karin is trying to link up with his dad. If we suddenly cut in, it will be bad for them. Yes, that won't be good. - It will be bad. - He is right, sir. We are a well known radio station. Let's not meddle in their father daughter relations. - All in the name of rating. - Yes, okay. Yes, he is right. That is so cool. Why so jumpy, dad? When are you going back to the village? You must have forgotten about your promise, dad. What promise? You can live here for a year, two years, five year. Or as long as you like. It's up to you. This is your home too. It turns out that you are right, Oskar. My dad is unlike what I thought he is. My dad is very happy to meet me and Gempa. My dad is a very kind person. He is a loving man and love to make sacrifices for his child. I feel that my father is an angel who saves my life. He bought me branded clothes. I feel like a princess, pampered by his father. Approved! Wow! Your letter is very incredible, Karin. This is good, right? After this we will have the audition for Reaching For The Stars competition. It will be aired live from Familia FM Youtube channel. My hero! The boss is happy because our rating is up. Thank you. Oskar. I'm your fan. - Good luck with your audition, good luck. - Okay. Yes, man. Why are you calling? I won't be cooking tonight, okay? What do you want to eat? I'll buy it. Lobster. Me and Gempa want to taste it. Lobster? No way. I'll buy Maman's fried rice instead. It's tasty, okay? No, I don't want to eat at home. I want to go to the audition. Kar, let's go on air! Okay, Damned friends. Hey. It's Familia friends. What the heck? Oh my God. Alright, Familia friends wherever you are... We have auditioned all of the entrants so we are going to conclude our show today. We still have one more entrant. Familia friends, there's another entrant of the audition today. Let's welcome her on the stage. Familia friends, what do you think this last entraʚt. Alright, Familia friends, so sorry if this entrant... ...Zuraida looks very nervous. I'm sorry but maybe you can perform in the next audition. Do try again. Keep your spirit up! Good luck. Hey, why are you clapping? I join this audition because my father supported me. This song is for him. Your voice is okay. Good enough. If my voice sounds good, just say it. No need to hold it back. The thing is, when I told you to join the audition... ...I didn't know you are my child. Do you understand? Now that you know, are you going to prohibit me? If you enter the audition, eventually everybody will know. - It will make things complicated. - No, I will keep on auditioning. Nobody knows Zuraida, my middle name. What makes you think you know it all? I am the committee, okay? - You will be asked for ID card. - That is easy, we can use Photoshop. Do not enter the competition. Do as I say. Just tell them you are busy or something. Tell them you suffer from tonsilitis. My tonsil was removed when I was in junior high. Why do you always answer me back? What kind of upbringing did you have? Why do you act like this? Answer me. Maybe it's because I never cared for by a father. Again... You... If you enter the competition... Who took care Gempa? Think about your son too. Poor boy. Gem, do you want to go to school? - Yes, I do. - Do you? Yes, I do. Gempa. Who am I? Grandpa. This is dangerous. I need to teach him. A long time ago, my grandpa and my grandma have three sons. Fauzi, Bimo and Toni. Bimo is the second son of my grandpa and grandma. Bimo is my father. Understand? Fauzi, the eldest son, has two sons, Pujo and Ahmad. Pujo married Sehan and they have children. Sehan is a masculine name, right? - Why is he married to Pujo? - Yes, right. Who am I? Uncle Oskar. Uncle Oskar is the son of first sibling of great grandfather's second wife. Good. Where are your parents? They are not here. Perfect. Let's go. So silly. You are so annoying, kid. Let's go home. He is not my son. Gem, do you like the school? I like it. There must be a pretty girl there. Who is she? - Her name is Diana. - Oh, really? So what did the principal say? - What is this? - What's what? Why don't you two take a bath? It's already late. You are curious, aren't you, dad? You want to know, do you? Me? Curious? Nonsense. We were just whispering. Please wait for a moment. The principal will be here soon. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you for coming, Mr. Oskar. Don't call me mister. Just call me Oskar. - What should I call you? - Just call me Mika. Mika, nice. What is your sign, Mika? How is Gempa's doing in his class? Is he naughty or what? At home he is a little bit chaotic. Well, actually, he is... What kind of music do you listen to, Mika? Oh yes, it's Gempa. You have to be more attentive to Gempa. There is this little girl who Gempa likes. But he is shunned because they say he is of low class. Okay, miss. This is insane. This video has a lot of viewers. This is a record for our radio station. I think it has a lot of potential. This is cool. I think Zuraida is the strongest candidate to become a finalist. If you look closer... ...I think Zuraida's style is like... ...a girl from the village. Wait. Do you remember the first time she got here? She brought her son. Maybe she got pregnant when she was young. And his boyfriend was not responsible. Nowadays there are a lot of young widows like her. Young widows? Yes. Young widows. You like young widows, don't you? Lucky I'm already married. What if I'm not? What if you're not? I will take her. How could you say such things? How could you? - Don't you have a daughter? - Right. I have one daughter now, Kar. Don't you have any shame talking about someone's daughter like that? What if someone talk about your daughter like that? - Do you like to hear it? - Right. You two are the same. Talking about her like that. Do you think you're good looking? Look at yourself in the mirror. - And you, does your voice sound really nice? - No, not exactly. There aren't many person who has talent like Karin. - Karin? - Zuraida, I said Zuraida. Use your ears. Oh my ears. Welcome, may I help you with the outfit? Do you need clothes for your son? Uncle Oskar is the son of the first sibling of the father of... the second wife of my great grandfather. Why? Don't you like it? It's so expensive. Miss. I'll take this. Find another more expensive. Get the lens! Get the lens, I say! On it, sir. - Oh, my. - Slowly. You said you're professional photographer. How could this be? Help us! Hold your head up, Zuraida! - Congratulations, Zuraida. Success to you. - Thank you. Karin. Karin Zuraida Kurnia. Do you still remember me? The first time I saw you in that video, I feel touched. And then? You go looking for me? Maybe this is your plan, isn't it? You are good at making plans, right? But I'm happy we can meet again eventually. I still keep your photos. One moment. This is the photo from junior high times. Yes, it's still the same. You're still pretty like you were. Does your principal ask about grandpa? No. - Are you sure? - Do you want to play? - Give me the cards. - Where's your money? Does she ask you if I have a girlfriend or not? No. Flush. You can't gamble like this. It's a sin, you know? It's finished. Give me my money. Who is your mother? Why don't you tell the school about it? Tell about what? That Gempa is a good player. What, is he a gambler? Hey, who teach you to gamble at school? Gempa, please show it to uncle Oskar. Wait, wait, is he going to gamble at school? You are very talented at playing the piano. That is very good. But you will get better if you practice every day with Ms. Mika. What about it? While you are practising, you can ask her if she has a boyfriend or not. What do you think? I don't want the piano, I want a toy scooter. Don't let Ms. Mika find out that I told you to. Tell her good things about me. Don't forget to tell her that I don't have a girlfriend. And most importantly, don't let Ms. Mika knows that I told you to do this, okay? Good. Let's take a break, okay? Yes. Ms. Mika? Are you have a boyfriend? So she doesn't have a boyfriend. Good, now find out what is her favorite food. And her sign too. Don't forget about it, okay? Okay? Really? My husband likes the crispy meal. It's tasty. So she likes a medium rare steak? Only with salt? Are you sure? Only with salt? I don't like steak, especially only with salt. One more mission for you. Come here. Where are you? You are out all day long. I'm with a friend. Rin. I hear a man's voice. Where are you now? Go home now. What's the matter? What's the matter? You should cook. There's nothing to eat, only noodles. Okay, okay, I will buy the meals. Alright, get home soon. Don't be too late. Be careful with the boys. Okay? I told you, you can buy anything. Mr. Oskar? Hello, Ms. Mika? Gempa cooks steak. He wants his uncle to eat too. - Can you come too? - Gempa is such a bother. I'm sorry, Ms. Mika. But it's alright, I haven't eaten too. Alright, wait for me. Bye. Hi. You are very pretty. So, are we going now? Gempa said he is tired so he is not coming. I want to be with grandma. Grandma? Which grandma? My mom. I see. Okay. This is the steak I like. It's texture is juicy. And it doesn't need sauce. Just a little salt and pepper. Very tasty. Me too. Really? What a coincidence? I didn't expect this. What are you doing in your free time? What do you do when you are not teaching? If I'm not busy working or broadcasting... ...I like to play cards with friends. And then I'll be late for work. What do you do, Ms. Mika? I don't like guys who play cards. Maybe Gempa misheard me. Next time, if you want to know my sign... ...just ask me in person. Ms. Mika. What kind of... ...guy... ...do you like? Rin, I don't know about this... ...but it feels like we are dating again after so long. You said I'm not like most girls. I still love you. I'm so sorry. I accidentally poured it on you. I'm so sorry. Are you alright? I'd better leave now. Rather than being showered again. Thank you. So, you are waiting for me now. You come home so late, it's not good. And your skirt is too short. Who did you go out with? Someone. Do you really want to know? - Are you sure? - Have you eaten? Yes, I have. I had dinner outside. Who did you go out with? Do you really want to know? Must be with Ms. Mika. Really? - Who is that person? - Do you have to know? You never told me anyway. You, me. Don't use that word. I'm your daughter. Come on let's go. Let me cover you. Why do you cover me? I accidentally saw you with him yesterday. Please explain it to me. It's nothing. You are not some kind of slutty girl that guys like Oskar can play around with, right? Hey, watch what you're saying. So it is true then. What does he promise you? What does he do to you? Or maybe you have moved in with him. Yes, I have moved in and now I'm happy with him. Rin, I can't take this. I don't like what he's doing to you. I will ruin his life. You never change. You should not go out at night so often. Especially if you go with a guy. That is dangerous. What danger? You know what I mean. Put it there. If all guys are dangerous, that means you are dangerous. You are insane. It is normal for a parent to be worried. Wow, you sound like most fathers. Do you think I'm like most grandpas? You're crazy. What will you sing in the finals? Yes, right. Do you have any idea? What will it be? I have a song from the Fantastic band. But it is not yet released. May I have a listen? Give me the guitar. I still remember the tunes but I forget the lyrics. Smile... One... Okay, now let's take a break. You can change your costume. Sir, please look at the pictures. One moment. This is insane. Oskar doesn't really change his behavior. It will not go public. I will not give you any money. Yes, I know that Oskar is the only icon in your radio. So don't blame me if your radio's rating is down. If you are looking for small change from endorsing things, that is up to you. - What do you mean? - Sit down, first. - So it's fixed now, Zuraida will be a finalist. - See! The jury have approved and there will be five finalists. What did I tell you? My prediction is right, isn't it? This kid is potential. I'm so happy. Who else the finalist? You are happy because our rating will go up, right? Of course. Not because you have something special between you and her, right? What do you mean by that? Here's why, Kar. This morning Sanusi dropped by. He said he has proof that you went with her. It's alright even if you do have something special with her. - What are you talking about? - Calm down, Kar. Do you think I'm afraid of you holding that hammer? Come here! Don't block me! Come here! Calm down. Don't come forward! - Don't fight him! - I'm standing still. I'm just holding this. Good evening, dad. I have some meals for you. You don't have to bother. Do you come here to get your revenge towards me? - What are you saying, dad? - Everybody in the office is talking about us. Somebody followed us. Maybe it's someone you sent. You want to destroy my life, right? What do you think this is, if not revenge? Why are you silent? Speak up. - We will talk about this later. - No, not later! - Gempa, go inside. - You all should get out! I told you not to enter this competition. But what, you insisted, right? Maybe this is your plan all along. You came here because I'm a celebrity, right? If I'm not a radio celebrity, you will not look for me here. That is not what I meant, dad. Maybe you're happy if this scandal goes big. You will be famous because of the rumors. Believe me, you will be famous. You will be rich, have lots of money. - Do you think I come to you for the money? - Yes. Because you need the money to provide for that boy! Do you really have the heart to think so? Yes, because you need a father's love. Yes, yes. I want to have a father! Now I have a father who's right in front of me. I want to have a father who acknowledge me. Why can't I admit that I have a father? Do you think I can be born without you? I was born because of you. Unfortunately... ...you don't belong in my life plan. Go now. Karin. Karin, Gempa! Dad, I'm sorry if I and Gempa have disrupted your life. From the beginning, we only want to meet the remaining member of our family. Rin, please take this to table 23. Excuse me, this is your order. So how is she? Have you tried to contact her? Her number is inactive. So you're not looking for her? Why not? You have no idea how it feels when your child suddenly appears with your grandson. You'll be shocked to death. Let me tell you how I think. Do you care more about what others think or about your child's fate? You should be grateful instead. Your child grows healthy and happy without being cared for by her father. Rin, you can sleep here. There's a mattress in the back. Thank you, ma'am. Mom, will we go to the grandpa's place or not? Do you miss grandpa, Gempa? Grandpa is funny. I like him. I have this one song back in Fantastic Band. Imagine you are singing this song at a big stage. Not here, of course. At a big stage. With a choir and stage lighting. I am sure you can sing this song beautifully. Tell me the lyrics first. I told you, I forget it. - You should write the lyrics. - Not me, dad. It should be you. You are good at manipulating the stories for the radio listeners. That is different. I do that for rating. Rating. Rating. Thank you for Ms. Ardika for sharing her story today with Familia friends. The next story is our last story, it is from Karin Kurnia. Familia friends, you all must be wondering about the continuation of Karin's story. Oskar. I just had a fight with my dad. And I decided to get out of the house. My dad had said something that hurts me. But I know... ...that he didn't mean that way. He must be very emotional at the time. And he must have regret it now. I want to see my dad, actually. But I don't know what to do. Oskar... ...what should I do? Please help me, Oskar. Tell me what to do. Okay, Karin. My advise is, if you are listening now. Please help him, he must be worrying so much about you. Kar, please take it off. A phone call. Your story is very good. Very touching, as usual. I have to stay away. My presence became a problem. Karin. Karin, staying away will not solve the problem. Even if your dad spoke like that. I am sure that it was not from his heart. Oskar believes he was just emotional at the time. It was not from his heart and maybe he didn't mean it. Do you know my father? I don't. This is my fault because I suddenly appear in his life. Did you just left? Did you leave him a message? Where are you? I went back to the village. My dad didn't like us staying in his house. And I shouldn't have gone looking for him in the first place. So there won't be any problem. My presence as his daughter made him do many sacrifice. Thank you for listening to my story all this time. Karin? Karin, if you are still listening to my voice... ...I only want to say one thing. If you can not forgive your father... ...then go after your aspirations. Not for your father. Not for anybody else. But for you alone. As a single mother, you have many dreams, right? Tomorrow, Reaching For The Stars final Oskar. Your instinct is wrong this time. There's no news from Zuraida and I don't think she will show up. It's your career, Kar. Oskar. It's your career. Let's go. - Where's the microphone? - Microphone? I don't know, it's not my job. My job is to love you. - The list of names. - Here it is. This is the list of names. - It is not complete, it is one name short. - Yes, it is one name short. I'm busy looking for the microphone. Wait a moment. What is it now? - Where is Zuraida? - I don't know. There's no news about Zuraida. She can not be contacted. There is nothing we can do about it. It is not my problems. That is your problem. I am busy. Oh, my. Fik, Fik. What about Zuraida? Zuraida, sir? Damn, damn. Uncle Oskar. Thank God she finally come. My instinct is right, sir. Okay. Okay. Hey, bro. Zuraida has come. I am sure that their relations is real. Are you sure that there will be some clarification drama? There's no need for clarifications. It is so out of date. Let's get to the point. Bad news is good news. The worse it gets, the better. Let's get the show, sir. Get on with it then. Why do you have to queue? I just want to keep it in order, sir. This is my show, understand? You will win, mom. Everybody wants to be a star. Everybody wants to make their dreams come true. We are going to make those two things come true... ...in this Reaching For The Stars singing competition. Sister Zuraida, please come. Don't go anywhere, dear. Mom is going to change costume. Okay. Check it. Are you ready, sir? Let's enjoy the show. Gempa! Before we get to the main event, I think it is appropriate... Gempa! Gempa! Do you see a boy? About this tall. Gempa! Gempa! Do you see a boy? About this tall. Gempa! Reaching For The Stars singing competition is an event from Familia radio... ...to appreciate our listeners. Turn it down, turn it down. Gempa! To prove and realize talent... Dad! Oh my dog! This is a cat. Sorry. Gempa! It is not easy to get to this stage. There is sacrifice, there is laughter. There are struggles. - Dad! - Hey, don't be so rough on her! Don't be so rough on her! Let her go! Oskar! Why Gempa missing? I don't know. Where have you been? What is happening? She is Karin or Zuraida? Miss, maybe you can explain this? Later, later. So is it your child or your grandchild? Explain it, Kar. Don't be an embarrassment. - Oskar, Oskar. - Okay, I will explain it. - Calm down, I will explain. - Yes, please. Karin Zuraida Kurnia... ...is my daughter. She is my daughter. Kar, that means Gempa is your grandson. Gempa Oskar Putranto is Karin's son. Yes, you are right. He is my grandson. Six years old. About this tall. He is very smart. He can play cards. He can play the piano. And he can sleepwalk. Even though sometimes he pees everywhere. But I am asking for your help. If you see my grandson... ...please tell me. Mommy! Gempa! You make us worried. Please, don't take pictures. Please, don't take pictures. The breaking news is posted. Now is the time to check my bank balance. You! Karin! So you have a child from this man? You dare to get her pregnant? You're irresponsible man. - Do you want to get beaten? - Who is this guy? He is Gempa's father. - You told me he has died. - You can kill him. I am on grandpa's team. You made her pregnant? Wake up! Oskar. Great! I admire you. Why, sir? Our radio's rating will go up again. Great! But why is it so chaotic like this? Calm down now. The important thing is, let's all go home now. We will continue this tomorrow. Think of the clarification strategy. Tomorrow I won't be at the studio. It's alright. Do it the day after tomorrow, then. No, no. Not the day after tomorrow. Not next week. It is no forever. This is your trick with Sanusi, right? Oskar, I have to think about your career growth. And our radio's career growth too. You still want to be a celebrity, right? That is what I mean, sir. I have been very wrong about my life. After my daughter and grandson arrived, my eyes are opened. Now I realized what I really need. What makes me really happy? Not money. Not popularity. What I need is love in my family. - Oskar. - What now? If you leave now, you won't be able to go back to Familia radio. This is my family. Take care of your own family. After the case of his hot video... ...Syaiful Syahrul the singer is back. - Why aren't you there, grandpa? - He hit Mr. Sanusi... ...who allegedly was distributing the scandalous video. Both of them are in the police custody now. I told you, your news won't be aired. I think it will be aired after this. Where? You are a nobody. Where, dad? The drinks are ready. - So many. - It's alright. It is good. That is the sentence for him. But remember, this is not the only sentence. There are many more. Dad is right. You still have to wash the dishes. Clean up the toilet and water the plants. Right. I'm on it. - Wait, one more thing. - What is it? You have to love your wife and son. The right thing to do is ask for my permission first. Don't just kiss her. Gempa, let's eat with dad. I will feed you. Go with him. Do you like to? - There should be me... - You not there. Yesterday there were a lot of journalists.
