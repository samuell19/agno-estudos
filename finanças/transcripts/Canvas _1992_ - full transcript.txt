Hey, Nick, uh... Where's ozzy? I don't have all night. He'll be here in a moment. Mr. Williams, I'm sorry I'm late. Hope I didn't keep you waiting too long. Nick, could you please get the painting? You're going to like this. Eh, no. Suit yourself. [ Snorts ] Ta-da. - Mr. Williams: That's it? - Yeah. That's fuckin' ugly. I'm not taking it. I beg your pardon? Guys, look at it. You can't even tell what it's supposed to be. [ Laughs ] This is the painting you asked for. No way. Not that piece of crap. This piece of crap sold for over a million dollars at an auction. You're getting it cheap. You better just put it back where you found it now, shouldn't you? No. Nick and his friend went to a lot of trouble to get this painting for you. Mr. Williams: I don't give a damn. Sell it to someone else. No. You sell it. You owe me $80,000. I thought you liked abstract expressionism. I don't give a fuck about this shit. I want out of the deal or I go to the cops. Hey, now, wait a second. I didn't mean what I said about going to the cops. It just came out, honest. I wouldn't say anything. Nick... Tell him. You believe me, don't you? - Open your mouth. - Tell him you believe me. Open your mouth. Nick: Don't shoot him, ozzy. He won't tell anyone. I swear. The money. Tomorrow. Good. Whew. Sometimes it's hard - not to lose your head. - Yeah. You just go, "eh" sometimes and-- [ gunshot ] - Nick: What in the hell did you do that for? - He's wasting my time. God damn it. I'm getting too old for this sort of stuff. - I'm tired of cleaning up your mess after you. - Yeah. I know, I know. You want to retire to some little villa-- where? In skiathos, Greece? Damn right I do. As soon as we finish this job for Anna Maxwell, I am out of here. You can use Brian for your dirty work. Brian is too hot. I told him to lay low. You just see if you can fit everything into his trunk. Au revoir. Next time you want me to put a body in a car, make sure it's a sedan.

Take this to Roger at the mackay street pub. - Know the place? - Yeah, the place stole our pool table. - Give it only to him. - Right. Roger will give you another 250 and don't make him wait. - Next time, leave the bike outside. - Yeah, yeah. [ Cheering, applause ] There he is. Whoo! [ Laughs ] [ Tires screech ] Hey, doofus! [ Tires screech ] Hey, what the fuck?! [ Groaning ] Never mind that shit! I got it! Let's get the fuck out of here! Have a nice day, wop shit! [ Yells ] [ Tires screech ] [ Music playing ] ♪ Figaro ♪ hey, figaro... Frank. Frank! Hey. Come on. The guy next door will start complaining again. Some people, they just don't appreciate good music. [ Snickers ] [ Laughing ] - What's so funny? - That. - You think it's funny? - Yes, it looks really ridiculous. You know, if word of this gets out, it's gonna ruin my reputation. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. What are you gonna do to keep me quiet? I'll think of something. Are you finished with Mona? Are you finished with Mona? No. No. And I, uh... I promised Mario I'd help him put it up today, you know? You're not going to be late for your own opening, are you? No, I got time. Don't worry. Ah, the hell with it, eh? [ Music playing ] Hey, it's a great sign, frank. Thanks, Mario. You know, you could make a pretty good living as a sign painter. You could do your artwork on the side and then who knows, man? Maybe then you could really settle down. Yeah, and die of boredom, too. Come on. Don't you wanna get married, have a kid someday? Steady income? I guess I'm just not much of a family man, you know? Yeah, you are. You just don't know it yet. You seen your brother lately? No, and I have no plans to, either. Frank, Tony's the only family you got, man. - When you gonna forgive him? - When I can forget about that month I spent in jail 'cause of him. I'm lucky Nathalie trusted me. If I'd have lost her-- - hey, you wanna talk about family? - Hey, look. I admit stashing the dope at your place was pretty low, but I heard he was trying to straighten out. Mario, I'm not interested. Excuse me, frank. - Jimmy, how are you? - Bene. Bene. I got a picture kinda like that. Nice. - I gotta go, frank. - What's the rush? - Let Luciano wait on him. - No, no, no. I gotta take care of Jimmy myself. He lent me the money to open this place, you know? I can't keep him waiting. - Take it easy, huh? - Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. I'm horny as hell. If I don't get laid tonight, I'm gonna die. Well, there's a lot of cute guys here. - You might get lucky. - What do you think, frank? Look, I gotta go say hi, all right? You're looking great. You know what I'm saying? The last available stud in town... And you got him. Hey, you put on some weight. How you doing? Have some beer. I think Simone wants you. Huh? You know that guy? Yeah, it's an old high school buddy. I'll be right back. Hey, Frankie. Nice to see you. So, Alfie, what brings you around here? Where's that fuckhead brother of yours? I don't know. I haven't seen him for months. Christ, Alfie. Take it easy. I haven't seen him. Frank? Nathalie, wait back inside. I'll be there in a minute. Nathalie, please. I'll be right back. Not bad. Can she dance? Maybe I should ask her about Tony. No. She doesn't know a thing. What the hell's going on? How's my brother mixed up with you? He needed the money except he fucked off with some of my property - and I want it back. - Tony would never-- all I know is I asked him to make a delivery - and he didn't do it. - Tony's no angel, but he would never steal from you like that. I don't give a fuck what you believe. That shit's worth 40 grand and if I don't see it or the money by the end of the week, your brother's dead. You got that? Yeah. Hey, frank, have a nice party. Let's get out of here. Frank, what did they want? Uh, they're just looking for someone. Who? - No one special. - [ Phone rings ] Hello. What? Mario, mar-- talk louder. What? Okay. I'll be right over. Of all nights? Can't you go tomorrow? It's just the sign. It's coming down. I gotta go fix it. Well, what if an art dealer shows up? I won't be too long, okay? [ Siren blaring ] I'll leave you two alone. You want coffee? - Tony, what the fuck? - Nice sign. Mario says you painted it yourself. Cut the crap. What happened? I appreciate the concern, bro, but it's none of your business. Look, I didn't drag myself down here just to listen to your smart mouth. Now what happened? - I fell off my bike. - Anything broken? Yeah, my wrist. I got a couple of cracked ribs and a fractured vertebra in my back. Nothing too serious, though. But for a bad back, it's pretty mild. Alfie came by my place looking for you. What did he say? That you stole some of his stuff. 40 grand worth. I didn't steal it, I swear. I was just doing my deliveries when these guys jumped me. - They must have been following me. - What guys? I don't know. I never seen them before. How did they know you were working for Alfie? How the fuck should I know? People talk, you know. What were you doing working for him in the first place? It's not like I work for the guy full-time. I needed some extra money. I knew Alfie was good for it. No, I'm not on dope again. I was trying to keep up with inflation. Do you know how much shit you're in? Yeah. Alfie wants his stuff back or the cash. I'll never be able to come up with that kind of money. Look... Maybe if you talked to him-- explain what happened. Frank, get serious. He's liable to kill me if I just show my face. But maybe we can get the stuff back. - How we gonna do that? - I know where the guys live. Never seen them before, huh? I can't believe this. I can't fuckin' believe what an idiot you are! - Good luck. - You're leaving? - Yeah, I got some people to see. - Oh, you mean Nathalie, eh? Ever since you've been hanging around with her, you don't even have time for me, not even two seconds. Nathalie, huh? That shows what kind of memory you got. Okay, okay, but what happened between me and you was a long time ago. - I've changed since then. - Then how come you're in this mess right now? You haven't learned a thing! Now I am tired of paying for your-- [ Door closes ] - Nat? - Hmm? I'm going to get going. I guess the dress didn't work. It's okay. I can always take it back. Nathalie: Bye. Hi. I'm Nathalie. I did the photographs. My boyfriend did the paintings. I'm ozzy Decker. Of Decker fine art on mountain street? Yes. You know it? Oh, yes. I've seen almost every show you've had since you've opened. How nice. Um, if you have any questions, I'll be over there. Oh, thank god you're here. Listen, people are starting to leave and we're running out of beer. Don't worry about it. I have a stash behind the couch. Who's the guy in the suit? That's ozzy Decker from Decker fine art. - No kidding? - He doesn't seem very friendly, though. So be careful if you try to talk to him. Okay. Mr. Decker? I'm frank Dante. Ozzy. I was wondering if you were gonna be here. Oh, sure. Uh, ozzy, can I offer you something, a beer? No. What do you think of my work? I think your small canvases are cramping your style. As I see it, with my experience, the interest will be in these larger paintings. - Interest? - Yes. I'm putting together a group show of local talent. Your brushstrokes are so bold. - Are you with a gallery? - Me? No, no gallery. Good. Good. This here is my most recent work. I can tell. I love this chaos. Whompf! This is very good. This is very good. Give me a call. No. Better yet, come by the gallery tomorrow. 3:00 sharp. Sure thing, Mr. Decker. - Ozzy. - Right. Did you see Nathalie's photos? I think they're pretty good. See you tomorrow. 3:00 sharp. Whoa. - I'm sorry, Nathalie. - That's okay. Hey, frank? - What are you doing here? - Well, I was just on the corner trying to figure out if you were home or not. - Yeah. Well, I'm not. - Frank, wait a minute. What? - Did you get the stuff? - Not yet. - What are you waiting for? - I was wondering if you could come with me. - You're nuts. - Frank, slow down, will ya? You know I can't walk so fast. Frank, it's not like I'm asking you to sell blood for me or something. Frankie, please. I got no one else. Wrong! You got no one! Now, I spent a month in jail 'cause I couldn't make bail, for what? For you, for little Tony? You're just damn lucky I got off or I'd still be sitting there rotting. And where the fuck were you, huh? Look, Frankie, I know you're never gonna forgive me. That's cool. Hate me all you want. Couldn't you just put this on hold for 20 minutes? - You got 20 minutes. - What? - Get in the fucking car. I don't got all day. - Yeah, yeah. I see why you want me to come here. What happened over there? Tony: Oh, that. Some wino tried to keep warm. Man, did he get toasted. That's not so funny, Tony. Relax, will you? The guy's fine. Last I heard, he was going to a.A. Meetings. Of course, he's kind of funny-looking now. - Tony! - Jeez. Follow me. Used to be an old sugar refinery. There's not much here now. It's got loads of character, don't you think? Yeah, loads. Frankie, you remember the time I got lost and mama sent you out looking for me and you found me in that old tire dump? It was something like this, wasn't it? Not quite like this, but close. Just like old times, eh, Frankie? Up here. My back is killing me. Caroline's stuff is over here and her buddy's stuff is over there. Whose stuff is that? - Uh, mine. - You live here, Tony? Well, yeah. It's not as bad as it looks. And the rent's dirt cheap. Anyways, Mario says I can stay with him for a while, so it's not like I'm crashing here right now. Hey, what the fuck you doing? - This one of the guys that jumped you? - Yeah, it's one of the guys! - Oh, it's you. - Fuckin' right! - Where are the goods you stole from me? - Hey, - don't have a hemorrhage or nothin'. - Frank: Where is it? - Don't know. - What do you mean, you don't know? Just that. Caroline and slammer fucked off with it early this morning. They're probably heading for the coast. I don't believe this. Yeah. They didn't even leave me my cut. - Cut? I'll give you a cut! - Okay, look. I'll think of something else, okay? Let's go! - Wop shit, huh? - [ Groaning ] I'm a dead man. I know it. I'm a fuckin' dead man. Will you shut up? I'm trying to think. - [ Fingers tapping ] - Will you stop that? I've seen what Alfie does to guys who try to screw him. Alfie's a businessman. He's better off giving you time to come up with the money. - Mario: Buon appetito! - Jimmy: Grazie. Mario, you said that Jimmy lent you some money, right? - Yeah. - Can you introduce me? Frank, if I had the money, I'd give it to you. You know that. Don't worry about it. It's not your problem. Jimmy, this here's a buddy of mine, frank. He wants to talk to you for a minute. Frank, that guy's no different than Alfie. You got any better ideas? Sit down. That's, uh, my brother over there. He got into this car accident. - The lawyer-- - how much? 40,000. But I'll have no problem paying ya back. And what do you do for a living? I'm a painter. - Houses? - No, pictures. I wouldn't lend you money if you were Michelangelo. The last artist I lent money to-- you know how much I got back? Niente. Now he paints with his feet. So beat it. My lasagna's getting cold. Enjoy your meal. Hey, frank. Slow down, will you? I can't go so fast. Guess my 20 minutes are up, huh? Frank, I'm really sorry I left the dope at your place. I wasn't thinking too clearly. Look, uh, I got to go, okay? I got an appointment. Well, well, what do we got here? Hey, Alfie, we were just on our way to see you, honestly. Yeah? What the fuck are you doing? Let him go! Frankie, take it easy. I just want to have a talk with fuckhead here. Wait here. You said we had a week! Listen to the man. He's just gonna talk. What's the matter, you little shit? You fall off your bike? Maybe you need some training wheels, huh? Maybe that's what you need, some training wheels. Oh, my god! Alfie, don't! Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank! Tony! I just want to make sure you got my message, Tony. - No hard feelings. - [ Siren blaring ] Fuckin' bastard! For Christ's sake, Alfie, some guys ripped him off! It wouldn't have happened if he'd kept his mouth shut about working for me. Right, fuckhead? And, you, big brother, if he don't come up with the money, you better, or I'll be coming after both of you. Come on. Let's go. - What are we going to do? - Shh. It's okay. - What are we going to do? - Shh. It's okay, it's okay. - I'm here to see ozzy Decker. - He's in the back. Thanks. These guys should be designing cereal boxes. Whoa! [ Laughs ] - Ozzy? - Frank. Come on in. Good to see you. How you doing? - Fine, sir. - Take a seat, take a seat. Just looking at some bad art here. I want to know... Have you been thinking more about me representing you? Oh, I haven't had to think about that too much. Excellent. I want you to know up front, I take 50%. Well, 50% is fine with me. - I guess it's the going rate, right? - Some take less. Some take more. If you'd like to wait and talk to another dealer-- no, no, really. It's fine with me, ozzy. Tres bon. I think we should celebrate. Would you like a beer, champagne, fast car, a wild woman? - Name it. - Uh, beer is fine. Me, too. Here you go. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Mm. This is a surprise. How is it I've never run across you before? I thought I knew every artist in this city worth knowing. I've only really been doing it seriously for about a year or so. Before that, it was just sort of like in between jobs. Ah. See these artist-- whew! Say, ozzy, I'm just asking, like, how much do you think my paintings would be worth? The big ones. Those are the ones. The big ones. 3... maybe 4,000. Less 50%, of course. I'll try to ask more, but the market has changed a lot. Oh, that's okay. I was just wondering if you would be able to give me an advance on my sales. Sort of like a loan? - How much? - 40,000. 40? Whoa! Pretty confident. Even if you sell all your paintings, you're still gonna come up short. When do you need it? - The end of the week. - The end of the week. The end of the week, the end of the week. How well can I trust you? I can keep a secret and I mind my own business... If that's what you're asking. I want to show you something. Come on. Once everything is loaded, that truck will be carrying almost 1/4 of a million dollars worth of art. Some corporations prefer to rent, not buy. When that driver signs that piece of paper, it means his company takes full responsibility. The insurance is payable to moi. Why you telling me all this? I want you to steal the truck. You're kidding me, right? No. I'm not. I had an extra set of keys made yesterday when they were picking up another load. You had this all planned. You're crazy. I'm not doing it. Fine. And you can forget about handling my paintings. That's not a good career move. Hi. This happens to be one of the best galleries in town, if not the best. Let me ask you something. What do you need the money for? It's personal. It's personal. Sounds awfully important. Yeah, it is. Good evening. Is the back open? I think so. Hi. I'm Nick. You're frank. Ozzy told me about you. Oh, yeah? What did he tell you? He tells me you're an artist-- painting. You know something? I was supposed to do this job. You stole my job from me. [ Laughs ] You get it? You stole it. Here. Ouzo. You still think you're not cut out for this kind of work, frank? - What do you think? - Couldn't do better myself. Just pay me my money so I can leave. Certainly. My pleasure. Very good. Count it. There's only $1,000 there. So? I thought I was supposed to get 40,000. There's no way this little job could be worth $40,000. It's going to be months before I see a dime from my insurance. What're you trying to pull here, ozzy? I'm not trying to pull nothing. You're $1,000 richer right now than you were a minute ago. By this time next week, you could have your 40. - Right? - Right. Ozzy: Right. It just depends on how serious your problem is. There's a small museum just outside of Hudson. It's only open during the summer months. The security is nonexistent. I would like for you and Nick to get me a painting... - Tonight. - I can't make it tonight. - Why? - Well, it's kind of short notice. You give a guy a little help and look what happens. Let me tell you something. When you came to see me today for the first time, I had no idea what would develop would be a very interesting relationship. You needed money. I offered you a means to make money. I'm perfectly willing to help you, but we have to get some things clear. What's to clear up? I steal, you pay me. No, there's more to it than that. - I need some guarantees. - Like what? How dependable are you? Dependable. $40,000 worth, then I'm gone. That sounds good. Here, I got a little something for you. Stay clean. Nick: I think when men work together, they should know a little bit about each other. We've been driving for 25 minutes... You haven't said a word. Nice weather. Don't you have a radio in this heap? Under the seat. Why show it off? Somebody would steal it. There are cassettes under the seat, too. [ Music playing ] [ Music playing ] Don't you got anything better than this? What's the matter with you? You don't like bazooka music? Forget it. Nick: There are two reasons why men steal-- greed and stupidity. Which one's yours? You forgot desperation. Oh. You're a desperate man, are you? Yeah-- well, no, my brother is. Oh. So you steal for your brother. Can't he steal for himself? Probably could. But you are a good brother. You steal for him. Why? Because he's a little bit under the weather these days. Now can you just stop with these questions and drive? Here. - What's this? - That is the painting that you are going to steal. [ Dog barking ] Got lost. Whoa. This... This is a real romantic spot. Didn't you know? I'm a real lady-killer. So I heard. You can see the prison from over here. In the daytime. Listen, I need my money. Pay for my way out of the country. I ain't plannin' on spendin' the next four years starin' at this place from over there. Did you know they had surveillance cameras? - So I missed one. - That's no excuse. What are you bitchin' for? Got your lousy painting, didn't you? Yeah, I did. Thank you very much, Brian. So give me my money and I'll get out of your face. You know, the police could still find you. So I'll hijack a plane to Cuba. Cuba? Cu-- - no. - Got any suggestions? Do I have any suggestions? Yeah. Yes, I do. You got to go somewhere. Here's some money. 5,000. Count it. But wherever you end up, I don't want to get any postcards. Just remember, we're in this together. It's like... family. Thanks. - Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. [ Dog barking ] Tell me, Brian. If they find you, - what are you gonna say? - Nothin'! I'm not gonna tell them anything. Good. Right. Bolt cutter. No, no. I got a bad shoulder. You do it. No, no, no. I got them for you. This is creepy. It should be. It's haunted. 200 years ago, they locked a party of english soldiers in the cellar, left them there. No food, no water till they died. Sometimes on winter nights, they say you can hear them howling for food. All right. Now, first lesson, don't touch anything. Just look. [ Rattling, thuds ] All right. Now check it out. Are there any wires? Any electrical contacts? Go on. [ Siren in distance ] Listen. - Did you hear that? - What? It's the cops. [ Siren blaring ] Listen, if the cops were coming here, they wouldn't have their sirens on. Trust me. Like when I did Donald Trump's yacht. They didn't have their sirens on then. Will you stop this talk? It's getting closer. I'm getting out of here. Hey! You're beginning to upset me. You don't like my jokes. You don't like my music. Now you're telling me how to behave like a professional criminal. Now just stand still, listen, and you may learn something. [ Siren fading ] Right. Get on with it. You mean just-- just-- just take it? Yeah, just unhook it. See what I mean? Piece of cake. Come on. I see I still got a lot to teach you. You should have been there the night I robbed onassis' boat. - Frank: I thought it was Donald Trump? - Trump, onassis. I robbed 'em both. Now, at this particular time, onassis was still going with this Greek opera singer. - Big lady. - For Christ's sake. She was the most remarkable woman. Bon vivant. You wanna see a good example of 19th century frontier American portraiture? I wouldn't know, ozzy. $10,000 will buy a lot of paint. Don't make any plans tomorrow night. You're going to be working. See ya. See ya later. Whoo! What do you think of our new friend? He's all right. Where's Brian? Uh, he decided to leave town. Let's go. - Hey there. - Hi. - Famous yet? - Nope. - Did you make a deal with him? - Mm-hmm. Oh! It's cold. Couldn't you use warm water? Sorry. Try and guess what I'm painting. Let me think. A sun? Try again. A flower? Nope. - An Indian chief. - Ooh, can I see? Wait. It's not done. Why an Indian chief? No particular reason. [ Giggles ] Can you hurry up? It's starting to tickle. It's almost done. - Nathalie? - Hmm? Nathalie, you know how much I love you. Frank, is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. Just fine. Here she comes. Be ready. Anna Maxwell, it's wonderful to see you again. - Hope you had a pleasant flight. - It was adequate. - You must be Nicholas. - Nick. - Can I get you a drink? - No, thank you. Okay. Well, then, let's get down to business. You will be happy to hear we have the klee for you tonight. Everything has been set up. There's more. The cezanne we discussed. Oh. The client has agreed to our terms after all. I want to take both paintings with me in the morning. - Both? - Is that a problem? No, no. I think we can handle that. You think? We can handle that. Good. Our reputation suffered greatly over that forged Van gogh. Hey, how was I to know? Nick, don't take it personally. - Woman: Ozzy? - Yes? I'm sorry, but you better come out here for a minute. Some detective wants to see you. Perfect. This won't take long. Excuse me. No, no, no. Do not touch the painting. I'm ozzy Decker. May I help you? Detective Austin, special unit, organized crime division. - Weren't you here last week? - That was me. Hey, look, I just came by to drop off this updated file on the stolen paintings. Stolen paintings? There's a list there and some pictures. Now, keep an eye out for that guy. He's our prime suspect. - This is getting out of hand. - Yeah. No kidding. Now we got the insurance companies breathing down our backs. Well, you're probably going to hear from mine. - We already have. - Good. I got a client in here. I gotta run. - Thanks for coming by. - Thanks for your help. Stay on top of it. Ozzy: Sorry about that. Anna: I hope there isn't a problem. No, no problem. Everything is under control. The cezanne is worth $4 million to the organization. One million goes to you. But if you disappoint us, ozzy... We will come after you for our losses. - Do you understand? - Yes. Good. I'm taking the early morning flight for London tomorrow. I want both paintings in my hands when I board. You will have both paintings in your hand when you board. - Is it coming off yet? - Sit still. Now there's a reddish, bluish tinge. Great. I can scrub harder, but i-- you know... I don't wanna hurt you. Frank... ...found stuffed in the trunk of his luxury car. Also found beside the body was an extremely valuable painting reported stolen only days ago. So far, police have no leads... - Is it off yet? - Almost, almost. I can see you know how to dress like a thief. Don't kid yourself. All my friends dress this way. Do you know a guy named Chris Williams? Chris... Williams. No. Don't know anyone by that name. They found him shot dead in a car - with a stolen painting. - No kidding. Hey, I guess we got some competition. [ Laughs ] Well, we got a lot of work to do tonight. Two jobs. Here. Have some good Greek coffee, hmm? It'll sharpen you up. [ Music playing ] What, you teaching me to be a peeping Tom? Hey, I got porno movies of my own at home. I don't need this. Is this real? Of course it's real. Where'd you steal it from? Some things you do not steal. This is my security. One day I may need this. For this, I have receipts. What are we waiting for? It's obvious they're staying in for the night. Of course they're staying in for the night. But I wanna make sure that he is in for the night before we go in. Wait a minute. I'm not going in there with anybody home. Are you crazy? This man has a state-of-the-art security system. It is so good that even I, the expert, cannot break it. The only time any portion of it is off is when he is at home. So that is when we go in. Oh, ho, ho. Cindy, I love you. Okay, get the tools. You carry them. I got a bad back. Thought it was a bad shoulder. The shoulder is connected to the back. Great. This is great. Is that a friend of yours? One of many. [ Giggles ] Smile nice for the camera, sugar. - Did you hear something? - Huh? No, I didn't hear a thing, sweetie. Thought I heard something fall. Oh, not now. Come here. Oh, yes. [ Moaning ] Wired to the security system. Give me a knife and the heavy-duty pliers. Right. Now... Cut the wall off? - Yeah. - [ Moaning continues ] - Ah! Chipped some board wall. - Shh! When I was a boy in Greece, the walls were made of solid stone. Stop talking and keep cutting. Okay, now. Let's see here. There. There she comes. Gently, gently, gently, gently, gently. Okay. Put that away. Hold these two together for me. Okay. Now... Pliers. Hurry. Take your time. Relax. They're enjoying it. I'm sure they are. - Where'd you learn this? - Self-taught. All right. Okay... Now, then... Now we just... Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it. Now... - Voila. - Man: I'm gonna get some more champagne. - Shh! - Woman: Oh, don't go. - Come on. - Stay with me. Damn. What?! Run. Run! What the hell? Man: Come back with my painting! [ Gunshot ] Son of a bitch! Oh! Shit! I knew we shouldn't have gone in! - Fuck! We could've gotten ourselves killed! - You got the painting? After all that, you're still worried about that fuckin' painting? - Did you leave the painting behind? - No. It's in here. Frank: Nick, what's wrong? Nick: Ugh! Hey, you're gonna have to drive. Ah, shit. Aw, man. Look, we should take you to a hospital. Just drive. - We got a problem. - How bad is that? It's okay. Got the painting, it's in the back. - Oh, god. - I'll see Dr. Chin. Oh, this is just great. I wanna know what happened. - Did anyone see you? - It was too dark. You should've been more careful. You ever been shot at before, ozzy? - It's not a nice feeling. - The painting is a total write-off. No klee. Do you know what that means? I know. It means no pay tonight. What do you mean, "no pay"? I almost got killed out there! Maybe next time you will. Right now you've earned nothing. - Give me half, then. - Not until you deliver. Fuck this! I'm not doing it anymore! Get over here! You understand this, Mr. Dante? - Do you understand this? - Nick: Ozzy, ozzy... Listen, he didn't mean anything. He's never been shot at before. He's shaken up, that's all. Ozzy, I need him to take me to the doctor. Okay. Go. Go now. Drive me to the doctor. Come on, drive. When's the last time you had a tetanus shot? About 12 months ago. Dr. Chin: It's very bad. I can take the bullet out, but I think there's internal bleeding. Just take it out. But I don't have any anesthetic. You have better than anesthetic. [ Speaking Chinese ] I should take you to a hospital. This guy's just a junkie. Don't be stupid. You go to a hospital, they see it's a gunshot wound, they call the police. You mustn't move around too much. Wound is very serious. Could cause a lot of trouble. It'll be fine. For you. Dr. Chin: Here. Take this for pain. - [ Pager beeping ] - Dr. Chin: Oh, excuse me. Come on. I'll drive you home. Not until I have a cezanne. I already told you, I'm not doing it. I thought you told me that your brother needed some money. - I'll manage. - You'll man-- manage? I give you an opportunity to earn some money and you only do half the job. Now I want that money. Look, Nick, I don't owe you a thing. You got your money's worth. Fine, kid. Fine. You go home. I'll manage by myself. Okay, look. Even if I do it, even if I do it, what guarantees do I have that I won't end up in the trunk of a car with my head blown off? What guarantee have you got now? Tony, what are you doing here? I just wanted to talk to frank. He went out, I guess. I don't know when he'll be back. Do you mind if I wait? Could be a long time. What happened to you? I fell off my bike. Frank knows all about it. Really? And when did you talk to frank? A couple of nights ago. Maybe you'd better wait inside. Nathalie: Strange. Frank didn't tell me about talking to you. Why do you suppose that is? I guess he didn't wanna upset you. I like what you guys did to this place. Yeah. It's been a while since you've been here. The last time, you kind of left something behind. Going to leave any more goodies laying around for the cops to find? Look, Nathalie, I'm as sorry as a guy can get about what happened. But frank and me, we made up. Everything's cool between us now. Really? Here. Give it. Tony, hi. Could I talk to you a minute? So you had to help Mario fix the sign. - Look, Nathalie-- - you lied to me. What was I supposed to do? He's my brother. - As if that's a good enough reason. - Yeah, maybe it is. I can't believe this. You swore you never wanted to see him again. Now here you are acting like nothing happened. Lay off. It's none of your business. Every time he shows up, he trashes our lives. I'd say that's my business. Great! Trash the place. - Hey, look, guys-- - you shut up. - Nathalie, I'm sorry. - Just get out. Jesus, frank, can you slow down? I guess Nathalie still hates my guts, huh? - Where are we going? - To see Alfie. - You got all the money? - No. - Then why the fuck-- - shut up, Tony! Just shut up! Aw, man! [ Music playing ] What are you guys doing here? Where's Alfie? Frank, are you sure about this? Stay quiet. He'll be down in a minute. Frank, can I get a beer? [ Knocks ] - Who is it? - Ozzy: It's ozzy. Nathalie, I know it's late. - Did I wake you? - No. I wasn't sleeping. Good. Is frank here? No. I need to speak to him. It's very urgent. He left with his brother. I don't know when he'll be back. Would you mind if I waited? I have a client that's leaving on a very early flight and I need to talk to frank tonight. - Okay. - Good. Hey, Tony, let's see some I.D. So you guys got something for me? Here's 11 grand. Consider it a down payment. Good, good. Glad to see you boys are working on it. - When do I get the rest? - Whenever I get it. Okay. I guess you guys are good for it. Enjoy the show, boys. So where'd you get the money? Sold a few paintings. Frank, I'm really sorry I got you into this mess. Really, I mean it. It's just--i just can't seem to get my shit together, you know. I'm not smart like you or talented. I'm just a fuck-up. What's gonna happen to you, Tony, huh? Am I gonna find you dead in a ditch someplace? - Frank, I promise-- - no, no. No more promises, okay? I stopped believing them a long time ago. So what do you want me to do? Name it. What did mama say, huh? Just before she died, what did she say? - "Try." - "try." Just a little bit. Nathalie? - Nathalie. - Nick: She's not here. Where is she? I don't know. Ozzy called me. He said you'd be helping me get the cezanne tonight. He said he had something that you wanted. If that bastard lays a hand on her, I'll kill him. I swear to god I'll kill him! What did you expect? - I'm gonna call the police. - Get serious. Just give him what he wants. As long as frank does the right thing, you have nothing to worry about. He's right. He does know how to keep a secret. As soon as he gets here with my painting, we'll all be able to go home. You have soft skin. Just relax. Just relax, just relax. Take this. Hey, I don't plan on shooting anybody. You just use it to frighten them. Trust me, it's effective. Go on. Now, you'll find everything you need in this bag. The painting's in the large room downstairs with the big fireplace. Good luck. [ Man talking on radio ] [ Phone rings ] Man: Good evening. Sportsmen's club. A briefcase? I'll go check. Hold on a minute. Man: Uh, yeah, yeah. Got it right here. Okay. See you then. [ Man talking on radio ] [ Alarm blaring ] Hey! Frank: Hold it! [ Tires screech ] There's nothing to worry about. This is all gonna be fine. [ Horn honks ] Stay put till I tell you to move. [ Garage door opening ] Feel better now? Here she is, safe and sound. - Nathalie, are you okay? - I'm okay. - Did he hurt you? - I'm okay. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. This canvas is superb. Congratulations. You're getting to be quite a pro at this, Mr. Dante. Ozzy: Put this in the car. I've got some business to take care of. If you would have listened to Nick in the first place, you would have spared your sweetheart so much trouble. Okay, look. You got your painting. Now what more do you want? I don't want anything else from you. I have all your paintings. Now maybe when you're dead, the value will climb through the roof. Oh, that's so sweet. - Hey! - Ozzy, come on. - What? - Let frank go. He did it. Listen. Right now, at this point in time, I want you to shut up and go wait for me in the car. Ah! Let go! Let go! I said let him go, oz. - Please, let him go. - Okay, okay, okay. All right. Ah! No! [ Crying ] Take me to the airport. It's okay, it's okay. Come on, it's okay. Woman over P.A.: Flight 94 to London is now boarding at gate five. All passengers for London... So what are you gonna do with all the money? I'm going back to Greece. Hate the winters here. Always wanted to buy a little villa in mykonos. Maybe you and the girl can come and visit me some time, huh? Frank: Mrs. Maxwell. - Where's ozzy? - Couldn't make it. I got something for you. Where's the klee? Uh, ask ozzy next time you see him. You'll get the rest when I get the other picture. Have a good trip. Now we should take you to a doctor, okay? Here. This should solve your financial problem. - No, Nick. I can't take it. - Go on, take it. - No. I don't feel right about it. - You earned it. Not enough, eh? Okay, here. No, no, Nick. No, stop, Nick. It's not that. It's... If I were to take it, it'd mean that everything I've done is okay - and it's not. - What's so wrong about it? Nick, you've been doing this for far too long. Yeah, right. I want you to have this. - Here, take it. - No, Nick. I can't take this. It's all right, it's all right. It's the only thing I ever paid for. I want you to keep it as a souvenir. Frank. Listen, when you sell it, don't take anything less than $45,000. Okay, Nick. We should really take you to a doctor, though. No, no. I fly to Athens in two hours. I'll be all right. I'll take a nap here. Okay. You sure you'll be all right? Hey, I've got Dr. Chin's magic pills. Go on, now. I'll send you a photograph of myself from, uh, outside my villa.

Just-- just leave me alone! - Nathalie, please. - I don't want to ever see you again! - You understand that? - Nathalie, I love you. Nathalie, please. You got to understand that.
