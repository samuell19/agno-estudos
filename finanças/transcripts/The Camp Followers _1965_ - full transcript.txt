"On October 28th 1940, wishing to match... the victories of his German ally in Europe... Mussolini declared war on Greece... sure that it would surrender in just a few weeks. And so, good men from an ancient civilization... battled ferociously at the Epiro range. The Greek Army resisted heroically... and by the end of the winter launched a furious counter-strike... that pushed the front back into Albanian soil. It was a long, tragic and useless massacre that cost... 23.775 casualties... 50.870 injured... 12.268 frost injuries, from which... more than 3.000 had to suffer amputations. Nevertheless, it was a lost war. Under the insurmountable pressure of the German forces... that intervened, Greece capitulated in April 22, 1941. THE CAMP FOLLOWERS/ WOMEN AT WAR -Attention! -Attention! -All civilians take shelter! Go to the basement! -Attention! A year later... the Greek people was on its knees. Hunger, shortages and diseases... had carved a deep rut of pain and humiliation... deeper than the bloody one... carved by the war. We helped in any way we could... but it was nothing. A drop in a sea of tears... and we were aware of that. No value could resist... the specter of hunger... And the bread, "ptsomi"... had become the only currency... the irresistible key that opened any Greek door. To me, a replacement first Lieutenant... sent to rot at the margins of a lake... by the Albanian border since the end of operations... going to Athens on a leave... had slowly lost all of its charm. It was a city of the dead. A big creepy cemetery where repugnant acts happened... which no one could stop. So, I could hardly wait to leave. Even a truck. Anything would do. It's that you're going north, Lieutenant. Well, get me anything, as soon as you can. We have one, but it will stay here in Pireus, another... Ah, but you, Lieutenant, are going back to Ocrida... So, Ok, I can get a truck... But you'll have to first report to Colonel Gambardella. - Why? - I don't know. But if an officer comes headed that way... I have orders to send him straight to the Colonel. Come In. Just a moment. Yes... it is hard... Who are you? What do you want! Lieutenant Martino, at your order! My dear friend, I don't have time... Sorry, but at the transport center I was instructed to report here. I need to go to Ocrida and the sergeant... Ah! To Ocrida! Why didn't you say so, lad? Come with me. Yes. How long have you been in service? 28 months. - Are you single? - Yes, Sir. According to the established... by the Occupation Command in Greece... the Army auxiliaries shall enjoy... a daily pay of 4 lira... regular troop rations... and the possibility of receiving the same... in the space of their own section. We'll commence the distribution of rations for 3 days. Antea Creriesa. Aspasia Anast?sio. Satula Emantri. Sofia Karamicali. Give it to me. You have enough. L?dia Uraki. It's the commission. One can at a time the madam, by the end of the war... will buy a 3-story brothel. -Ebe Bartolini. - Here. I'm Italian, Colonel. Veneta. I've been in Abyssinia and Spain. Promoted in bed by prostitutional valor. Look who's talking! Go to hell! Eftikia Damidatis. -Come! -Eftikia Damidatis. I'll take my friend Eftikia's and mine. Ok, take them. -You're Eleni Carabolis. -Yes I am. Give her a double ration. Thank you. How old are you? And you, how old do you think I am, Colonel? About the age of my granddaughter. -That's all. -Yes, Sir. All in order. Alright. That's it! 11 recruits and a glorious veteran... to deliver to our military brothels from here to Ocrida. sergeant Castagnoli knows the way like the back of his hand... and he'll be useful because he's got great experience. That's kind of you, Colonel. You've got it all here: itineraries, instructions, medical certificates... and register sheets for the girls. From now on, you're attached as auxiliaries of our army... and you are responsible for them, understood? Well, I didn't get orders... And for such a mission, with no precise orders... That's what I'm doing: giving you instructions. Aren't you satisfied? A beautiful trip, in good company. The girls are happy to be with Italians. Come on. I can't understand you. Are you a volunteer? Yes, Sir. And maybe you're even fascist. I don't care for politics. Listen carefully... and don't interrupt me... because when I talk too much I get asthma. When I was a student and you weren't even born... the illustrious teachers taught us... that this country was the cradle of civilization... and that today we would be barbarians without the ideal of beauty... set forth by the forefathers of these tramps. And when those teachers, between 1921 and 1924... were beaten up, humiliated and exiled... we were too weak to move a finger and it is why... you were taught at the point of a cane. When a stupid teacher says he wants to rip the kidneys... of a people on its knees... that dignity is between the asscheeks of their sisters... and that whores are to be used in the dark... and not to be treated like human beings. And then? And then this is what you deserve because this is an order. And if you don't like it you can go elsewhere. Yes, Sir. If I'm of no more use to you, I have something to do. As you wish. Departure is tomorrow at 0900, from the car pool. -And have a nice trip. -Thanks. Hey you! Take that stuff away, that's my spot! Calm down, honey, I got it and by the first stop... Sorry but I've already picked my stop. Me too, the first! -sergeant, are we ready? -Yes, Lieutenant. Panaiota! Panaiota! -Hold here! -Come with us! -What's going on? -We started well. Must be the patriot. We better get rid of her quick. Stop. I'll take a look. What's happening? Hey! Hey! Who is that one? You better leave! Who's she? Toula's sister. She jumped in such haste... she could have broken her neck. She wants to go too. Well, she better step down. Now! You, get up and get her out. You better step down so this won't get ugly... -and get me in trouble. -No! Let go of her! -But let her stay... Get your hands off her! Lieutenant, let her come! Else she'll walk the streets... -and it will be worse, poor thing! -Step down! and no more talk! What you're doing? Are you crazy? -I want to stay. -I'll leave, then. I will leave then. You there! Come here! Get back in the truck! -Come! -Lieutenant, what about her? Let her stay. Let the carabinieri deal with it... at our first checkpoint. Get down! Let's move. You, don't move! Castagnoli, let's go! Let's go! Lieutenant! They're 12 women? Yes, but one is not part of the group. She sneaked in. Tell her to step down. Tell me which one is she. Show her to him. Lieutenant, since you're heading north... and if you don't mind, a milizia Major has arrived... from Italy, headed for Porka. Could you take him? As long as he doesn't mind! He surely won't mind! -To the Italian Brothels? - Yes. -How many? -12 girls. Lieutenant, if he notices that they're 13... we'll be in deep trouble! It worked. Alright. -We're leaving! -Wait! I'll call the Major. Just a moment. Lieutenant Martino. Mr. Alessi, thanks for the hospitality, Lieutenant. In Italy they talk about blitzkrieg... and I've been sitting still for 4 hours in there. What are you carrying? Recruits for the military brothels. Yes, the Italian soldier can stand all scarcities... but that one! Load my stuff, but be careful... Some are quite fragile! Secure them well. Yes, Sir. Lieutenant, we can't seat 4 in the front. You seat at the front, I'll hop in the back. No! Ok, as you wish. It's a long trip, we'll alternate places. Ah, Lieutenant! Please, my chandelier! Take care of it! I will! Mind your feet, Lieutenant! -Have a nice trip, Major. -Thanks. -Can we go? -Yes, of course. Why not? Clear the way! Hey, you! Come out, come. We've adopted her, Lt., isn't it? Until someone finds out, at least she'll have food. -What did she say? -Eftikia said that... she thinks you're gonna take her can... Like Ms. "Metress". -How did you learn Italian? -I studied Latin. Then I also studied Italian... because it was very easy for me. Italian comes from Latin... -and Latin from Greek. -I know. Eftikia went to the same school... but she's better, she's more studious. -She speaks Italian much better. -Is that true? -Yes. -Lt., I speak Italian too. And I lived in Italy, in Bari. I lived there with my family for 5 years. We were repatriated due to the war. Ok. What, Lt., you don't like our company? Did you know that in ancient Greece our trade was much honored? -And since when do you practice it? -I enlisted only 3 days ago... but I've been charging for over a year. Not like a true professional, but close. And her? She enlisted 3 days ago too, but she's different. She's always thinking. Almost never speaks. I push the thoughts away. They're of no use anymore. I once had a great love. -Was he Greek? -He was English, blonde and thin. It was he who gave me the coat. -Where is he now? -He died. -How? -I don't know. But why so many questions, Lt.? Answering is dangerous. If someone talks: ta-ta-ta-ta-ta! But the Italians don't shoot people like that! Nobody knows, nobody understands. I don't understand the Italians. Some say: we won. Others say: we lost. They're afraid. How crazy! Explain me something. Why that one wears a black shirt and you don't? Explain it to me. Ah! Once I saw an Italian... spitting on a picture of Mussolini... and another who was near, punched him in the face... very strongly. It was an ugly fight. The old man was crying. He was looking for his glasses. in tears. He had a white beard. Oh My! Listen, darling... turn around or you'll get us all dirty! Turn! What's up with her? Is she bothered... because I sat here, in the Lt's spot? Oh no! It has nothing to do with you. She's just a little wild. Take a good look at her. Leave me alone! What's this? -stay still. You have to scratch her like you do with a kitten. -If that's what it takes, I will! -Where are you putting your hands? How strong you are! Made of iron! Leave me alone! Stay still for a bit! Quiet! Lieutenant! Don't stop here. It's better to take them further along. If the troops see them, they'll eat them alive. It's been 15 days since we had some. Stop around the back, in a square. I'll send the Med Sgt. He'll take care of them. -Yes, Sir. -Goodbye. Welcome, Major. I have the reception papers. Hand it to the Lt. in the back. He's the mission chief. -I'm a passenger. -I beg your pardon. Lt., I have reception papers for 2 girls. I know. Who prefers to stay here? Mr. Lieutenant... Ephigenia can't continue. She's suffering too much. Isn't it better if she stays here, for her and for us? What do you think? Alright. Come down, then. -Goodbye. -God bless you. Mind your bag. -God bless you all. -See you some day. Have a nice trip. We need one more. Well, I can take care of that if you want. Ok. Arrange it with them. -Where's the Officer's hall? -At the HQ, Lt. Right on the ground floor. We'll leave in 1 hour. Keep guard on the truck. -Feed the girls. -Sure, Lieutenant. Major? -Ain't you coming for lunch? -Yes, of course. Listen. What would you give me if I left you one who's still a virgin? Like her mom brought her into the world! A jewel! -And who would that be? -It's me! We're all virgins! Untouched. How naive... at your age you don't know... what problems virgins may create? Shut up! Or I'll take care of you! Got it? So, interested or not? Do you give more credit to the words of a whore -or to what I say? -I'm sorry, but... Then, I will choose and you'll get the one I pick. You shut up. Speak when I tell you to. -You! -Me, sergeant? No, you, the other! -Me? -Yes. Granted to the gentleman. The party starts in 1 hour. -Waiter! -Yes Sir! Quick! Serve the girls first. What would you like to drink? Wine! Wine red as blood! Guests for the Officer's club! -I knew it! -What? Hey, get this going! Hear, I'm ready for the first round! That's all we needed! Here is Radio Fama. This is our soft music program, transmitting... They're fattening them up like Strasbourg ducks! Efitikia, get the knife. -No, don't need. Toula, pass the bread. -Want a sip? -No. What, are you offended? Stupid idiot! You should apologize. And so... shall we drink together... or should I hit your head with it? Did you spit in it? What? Drink, fool! Just a sip. Take it, it's yours! Help yourself, sir. Castagnoli! -What happened? - a 'Force majeure' What does that mean? -Force, Major! -Thanks! Come back here! -What's her name? -Toula! -Toula! Come back here! Come! Come on! Toula! Toula! -Who told you to stop? -That man. Here I am the one in charge! I know, but I thought about the heat. Who stands up to a man in heat? Mr. Lt., could we take advantage of this forced stop? Yes, it is ok. Thanks. Come here. Careful so they won't fly! What? The stuffing of the panties and bra. My hair won't stay put! -Yes, it's too windy. -She wants nail polish. Nail polish! Castagnoli! Honk. We're Leaving. Honk! Enough. Here we are. Are we leaving? Major, I didn't order this stop. But come on, 10 minutes won't kill anybody! You there, get in! Let me explain, because this is a mission. Of course! So? You'll have to tell me if you want to take command. Oh, no! What are you saying? It's not the case. Then I ask you to consider yourself a guest... that will receive due attention in the limits of the possible. The girls and the sergeant... Will get their orders always and only from me. May I remind you, Lt., that I am your superior... and that the tone you're using... I ask you, Major, we have many miles to cover. Ok. We'll get back to this subject. You! Back there with the others! Yes, get in the back. What does he think he did, an offence? Now it's gone. Eftikia. Eftikia. Eftikia, be strong! -Is it malaria? -Yes. How, so quick? Nowadays disease comes fast, Lieutenant. Give me a blanket. -Are they all ill? -Almost. -Don't you have quinine? -Quinine! Last month in Athens they bartered... an astrakhan stole for 4 pills of quinine. Let's cover her well... or she may get pneumonia. Castagnoli! One of them has fever. Do you have quinine? -No. -And you, Major? Yes I have. "Italquinine"! -What? -"Italquinine"! Do you know what they call the "Italquinine"? Mosquito snack. Take it. Take it! Give me water. -What are you doing? -what a fool! Idiot! For everyone... or for no one. The muslim passed her on to someone else. In this place, they exorcize the evil and feel like on vacations. Nobody knows what is war. They're shepherds and at home they have a little of everything. You're fine. Promoted. Ah! This one really looks like sent for the Colonel. Leave her alone, her papers are not in order. What will it cost, Lt.? I can fix that at the Command post. No. It's better not. -We could try... -Oh, forget it. Lt., if you want... I can fix this, like I did in the morning. No. Lt., your jacket. But I'll need 3. 2 for the officers and 1 for the troops. You know, don't you? Of course, Sgt. Pick them. And me, don't you want to give me the honor of an inspection? You. And the blondie. May I play, Captain? Let's get a room, honey. Ah, beginner's luck! But what happened to this poor thing? Looks like she's been thru five wars! She's so well-mannered, stays all quiet... Once, in a brothel in Milan... I saw one coming down the stairs in a tux with a cigar. How long since your last leave? I've forgotten already. Bah, you're kidding. S?rgio, put some mascara on her. Lt., would you come with me? Sorry, it is not your turn yet. You'll have to wait. You get back to your seat. Buddy, it's an old tradition here. Sort of "commander's rights". Every brothel has its rules. -And how do you know that? - Guys! There are more in the garage. 5, 6, 10, a whole truckload! -The Colonel! -They're just passing by, leaving tomorrow. -Attention! At ease. At ease. In here there are no superiors or subordinates. Here we are all pigs, Mr. Officers. Open, girls! Command inspection! Don't be scared, sweeties! Open! We're all young and with high hopes! We're all officers! Get ready! Open! What are you waiting for? We'll break through! Pigs! Oh! Good evening, beauty! -See how many they are! -Miss! -It's full of women! -Get comfortable, sirs... To us, tonight or tomorrow is the same. But one of us has syphilis. Go ahead, if you wish. -No! Don't listen to her! -What do you think, Medic? I don't know. I've examined the others. Here, I should go one by one. I don't care. Now we lost our places in the line. Leave them! Yes, let's go. I've lost the will already. So did I. I'm out. Forget it. I want you dead in disgrace... Thank you. I'd let them in, poor kids... We're not doing anything, anyway. It would be a little bonus. Oh! Mr. Lieutenant! -Is it alright? -Now it is. Imagine! If it weren't for her shielding us... at this time we would all be dishonored. You all get to sleep, we leave early tomorrow. Understood? Very well. Oh, Ebe! Listen, I've been to the command post... Tell Toula that I fixed her sister's situation. I had her papers done under my endorsement. Toula! Her papers are in order. See if Panaiota is OK. What? Do you think I don't know why you didn't leave me here? You want me to do with you what Toula did with the fascist. Prostitute to go. Then on the next stop I'll leave you. Or you'll take me to the last. At your place. In your brothel. There, it will be my duty. But you'll stand in line like the others. When it is your turn, you'll pay me. Ok. We'll do as you say. Take it! I brought the quinine, as you wanted, for everybody. I'm sorry. Believe me! Like the others, I was on your side. I understand. Really. That's not enough for you, is it? Thanks. What for? For the quinine and for Panaiota. You laugh? Listen, I made a false statement to the command... to register a little kid. And I was happy... and ran to tell it as a surprise. What have we become? Maybe Eftikia knows and sees me fairly. Lt., you think too much. That's no good. But I... I'll be happy to make love with you, you know? How do we say it? If you want? Or if you wanted? -What? -To make love. -If you want. -So if you want... I'll be glad. What's happening? What's not happening! Not a living soul around! Where's everybody? -Who are you? Where are you headed to? Lt. Martino, on the way to Ocrida. Forget it, Lt. We're on a state of emergency. You can't proceed, especially with such a cargo. They're whores, no? But what's happening? Last night the partisans overtook the brothel guard... and took the girls. The troops are scouting the area... and if they get the girls back, you're good... else we'll keep these. They came in the right moment. My orders don't include a delivery here. We'll see. For now, you'll stay... and nobody leaves the truck until I come back. The 'bersagliere' seems quite upset... What now, Mr. Lieutenant? You've heard it too. We'll wait. Dammit! We take a year to enlist the girls... and in a moment they're taken away like that. They can't do that to me. What are they thinking? -I'm Italian. -Yes. Put up a sign. We fascists are the prime... targets of the partisans... For such occasions we have a provision of insignia. Yes, sure. Second patrol! Change of turn! Be alert! -What happened? -Somebody shot the truck! -From the rooftops! Quick, search! -You, go there! -And you, to the mosque! Go, run! Don't let him get away! Surround the houses! Search tem! I want that sniper! Sergeant! One ran away there! -And the others? -There on the rooftops! Come out! Hand over that traitor or I'll burn the village down! Cowards! Cowards! Come up! Hand over that bastard... Or I'll have each and every house torn down! If anyone dares to challenge us... be ready to pay a high price! I'll blow you up with your filthy houses... you Greek worms! Murderers! Cowards! Due to the situation, I won't hold you longer. You may leave. -You told us to stay. -Now I tell you to go! Can't you see that you're being shot at? It that's how it's here, it'll be worse on the road. At least here we have your protection. But I can't protect you! I have 15 men... and the village may explode any minute. The girls are a lit fuse! I can't keep them here. Cap., are you aware that you're sending us to our deaths? You'll take an escort of 3. Lt., how many are with you? 3. But you, Major, may stay and wait for safer transport. What do you think that I am, Lt. Martino? I'll stay by your side and please allow me to apologize... You're running a real mission here... and I'm sorry if, for a moment, I took it as a joyride. No hard feelings, Lt. -Well, I'll round up... your escort. Get aboard. -Get in, Major. -Now I'll go in the back. I'll take 2 bersaglieri. -The 3rd goes with you. -Ok. They got them back! The bersaglieri are always the bersaglieri! They're back home! We showed them! Mission accomplished, Cap. No losses. Very well! -And right on time. -Not bad. Oh, excuse me a minute. Lt., It's all clear! You won't need an escort! They ran to the hills... and one company is after them! Good luck! Eftikia, take this. Ah, there you are! How pretty! You needed some refreshment, didn't you? All fesh and clean! What a tight space... Don't you think, Lt.? -I don't think so. Let's hope it's enough for some good rest. Anyway, 1000 times better here than... at the filthy place that they'd give us in the village. You did well by refusing it. Just look at that! Can it be any goofier? With all due respect... You want it washed? Thanks, honey! Wash it! Would you give me your shirt? It'll be dry by morning. Good, thanks. Cookie! Would you wash my shirt too? Yes! here! You're classy. What are you looking for? A 4-leafed clover? Radish, I love it. It's great with olive oil. If you let me borrow your bowl to season it... I'll let you taste a bit. Now a shave, clen pajamas and then... Hmm, not too dry... Stupid. Your ticket, Sir. I have a free pass. A joker... Oh! The Marquise of airhead! Are you stopping in Budapest? Sit down, fool. Here's the bowl. Ok, open this. It's fine here. It was a good idea. Have you travelled in one of these? Yes. Once. With an old man... who kept tormenting me all night long. I never did, dammit! When I get back, now that I have some money... I want to sleep in one like this... from Bari to Brennero. Take this, mix it. I like this picture. Looks just like my daughter. Damn! It won't come off... It's fastened well. You have a daughter? At Friuli, with my aunt... who takes care of her. How old is she? Four and a half. Mine's six. You're married? No. What about the mother? No mother. Take it. In other times... before you gave birth, you must have had great boobs. I still have them, if you want to know. -Let me fel them. -Get your hands off, fool. What the... What do they want? Hey folks! Are the bitches in? Watch your language! Come forth and present yourself. Did you hear me? Move! Come here! What a crock. Who are you? First Squad leader Ettore Minghetti... -23rd cavalry. -23rd cavalry? Gold medal in Spain... I'm Mr. Alessi, designed to the Corcia Command. Commandant! It's the Lt. who in command of this expedition. Explain yourself calmly and clearly. And politely. What do you want? Sorry. We're far from Nausa... returning from a mission. At the village we were told that the who... the ladies were in the train and so... we came to get what belongs to us. -What belongs to you? -The one for Nausa. It's been 20 days that we're told that she'll arrive by tomorrow... and she never arrives. If you hand her over we save time and you'll shorten your trip. It's true, Lt., we'll save 90 km... because we can go straight to the border. Go get the papers. Hi, beauty. Here they are. Anastasia Aspasio, 22 years old, half Barese. Hey folks! She's just an Italian slut, what about it? No problem, as long as she's chubby and hot! Ettore, don't fail us! We want her to be pretty! Sign here. Ettore, a pretty one! We want a pretty one! What do you expect? A Miss from the national brothels? Bye. Bye. We're coming! Treat her right! And good luck! We're the masters of the musket para-bonzi bonzi-bon Of the jokes and of the games para-bonzi bonzi-bon You shouldn't look at war trains. They make us sad. They have that effect on me. You can't sleep? Neither can I. You don't feel like talking? We haven't talked in a while. Tell me something. Something about you. Do you want to know what I dreamed of? Ok. Let's hear the dream. I dreamed that Italy was occupied by soldiers... Greek soldiers. My brother was bringing a truckload... of your hungry girls to the victors... and one of them was your sister. If sometimes I forget and smile... it is just because I'm 20. But later, I curse myself. Who's that? Dammit! Oh, forget it... How you like it! Tell me how much you like it! Take it! The hell with you and your ideas! I had to take the train apart! I heard it. I think that they made this first... then built the whole train around it. Take it. Oh, don't thank me... you could get hurt... I washed your shirt, we're even. So? Why you're standing there? Make you mind up, in or out. In! But let me warn you... I don't do it for free since I was 15. Ah, you want me to pay you? No. I just said it. You don't remember how to do it anymore? I don't know... but I can try. I'l teach you. Come here. Don't touch there! So it is true! Your panties are stuffed with money, front and back! But there's something stiff here, what is it? My checkbook. You're a walking safe, you smarty girl! How much is it? You count it... What are you doing here? Nothing. It is too hot in there. And you? The same. No... I lied. I came because I saw you. I didn't tell anyone about last night, believe me. And I won't say a thing about tonight, if you wish. I know that all you think of is Eftikia... even when making love to me. but I don't mind. I'm smart. That's it! I'll let it go! She's full of hate! She's a whore and hates! No, I'm sorry. And you, how much do you have? Nearly the same as you have. And where do you keep it? Wouldn't you be interested in a hotel? Not really. Pity. We could be partners. Me and you, partners? How cute! A nameless slut... Me, upon returning to Prato... I'll buy a pair of looms... to make British fabric: Kosich. Kosich made millions. That's it. As you wish. Instead of a partnership, we'll make... a pact. We're equals... equally smart... have the same money... and each of us has a kid, finally. So... the worst can't happen. Until this war ends, nobody knows what may happen. So, if my time comes... you'll take my money to do as you wish... and will take care of my son. But if it is you... just the same and I'll care for your daughter. Do you agree? Hey! -Did you hear me? -Yes. So? You're such a fool! Do you know what hunger is? Real hunger? Yes, I've seen it. No. You saw it... but didn't taste it. You can't resist... because at a point you reach the end. In a shipwreck... or if lost in a desert... there's only hunger. But when it is by the hand of men... like in war or poverty... when you don't even have work anymore... Hunger comes after many other pains. Really. Then, it is better to die. I know many who chose to kill themselves. Eftikia tried too. She only tried... but she got scared and asked for help. So I took her to the madam. I had already enlisted. So she signed up ... and the madam gave her food. And for hours, many hours... Eftikia ate, and ate, and ate... If you'd seen her then... You would have cried. But now she's not hungry anymore. Now it is over, she's not longer like that. Now she suffers because she has to make excuses... she has to tell herself... "I'm hungry. I'm here only because I'm hungry... I am hungry and they feed me". Understand? You say that she hates... but it is not you whom she hates... She hates herself. Go! Keep moving! The black shirts. They're the ones from yesterday, Lt.! Oh my God! Oh my God! -Quiet! -Toula! Toula! All of them! All murdered! How could this happen? Who did it? Who do you think? The partisans. Blasted! Accursed! An ambush! Treachery! Where's the Lieutenant? Murdered! -Search, lads! The Lt. is here! Here! They killed him! They killed them all! All! More than 30! I think we don't have enough bags. Look! 30! All young! Recruits! They didn't even have... the time to defend themselves. Cowards! Murderers! And what is the command doing about it? Nobody moves! Are they asleep? Where are they? They're searching the area. There will be reprisals in all nearby villages. I want to go too, I want to be there! -Where are the briugades? -I've told you, Major... they are around, searching the hills. We're the 3rd gravedigger battalion. Our job is to pick up the dead. Avenge them! We have to avenge them! Work! Are you asleep? Whose tag is this? And you, what do you have? Malaria? I wish! I have fear! Fear, alright! I have fear! We're going to meet the partisans! We should be going back! Back or forward is the same! We can meet them anywhere! If they wish to attack, they do! And why would they do that? Because of the girls! I'm sure it is because of them! Stop that! You're a coward! Ah, isn't that so? First the soldiers at the brothel. Then we were attacked in the village. -What do you mean? -Now that! A bunch of dead with that one from the back. We're carrying dynamite! Tell the Lt., Mr. Major, to let them all go here! Lets leave them all here and screw it all! Drive! Don't talk! Drive! Come on, step on it! It's an order! What is it, coward? If you don't drive, you'll die! Start right now! -What's happening? -he won't drive! -What's this, Major? -I'm not refusing! I really can't! I can't see the road! The road? I'll show you the road! Calm down, Major, give me this! And you, get in the back! I'll drive. That's not the end of it! I'll have him court-martialled! Go! Go! Thank you. See? When gear strikes like that, there's nothing you can do... -but wait until it is over. -It's a shame. What are you doing? 2nd gear is here. Yes. That's it. Help! Help here! Break the glass! They shot the rear tires! I lost control! Help! Lt.! You're gonna kill us! Kill us! Slow down! Slower! She's hurt! Help! -Can you walk? -Yes, yes. Help me then. My leg! Get out! Quick! Quick! Get away! Eleni is hurt. She doesn't move. It can blow up anytime! Come, come! My leg! I can't move it! The truck's on fire! Where's the money? -Oh, my leg! -Somebody help me here! Help me! I can't take it anymore. Hey you! Help here! Careful, his legs are hurt. Easy. easy! Come! Let's go in there! Let's put here there. -How's she? Alive? -Lets lay her down. Courage! Help me. Easy! Mind her head. Easy. Easy! Slowly. Easy! Be careful! Oh! My back! I can't take it anymore. Leave it to me. In that corner. Let's lay him down. Go slowly. Courage! Keep calm. The truck is still on fire. Don't you know... that at night you can see a lit match from 5 km away? Here it is. Cover yourself well. Are you better? Yes. Elenitzia, Do you want me to open a can? Yes. I fell I'm going to die. Just now that we have so much bread! -You'll pull through it. -No. I'd like so much... to eat a little. Quick! Try to rest. I'm sorry. It is useless to look, Lt. It'd be a miracle if anything passed by. After the sunset, ours never travel. How are you? Eat! Listen, Lieutenant. She won't die. Believe me, she won't. She can hold on in this state until tomorrow. Believe me. We must find a way out of this mess. Before it is too late. How? The only way is to send someone to get help. Who? Me. I'm not afraid. Within 3 or 4 hours' walk... I can find a village. I know this place well. Come look! It's a spy! We've got to stop him! -Damn! -Don't shoot! But he will... he'll tell them, damned. I bet he will. Yes, I've decided. I'm looking for help! We have no alternative, Lt. Sadly, we have wounded, unless you want to abandon them. With a little luck I'll get back with help before the partisans come. And if you don't? I will. I feel I will. And in a few hours I'll be back with our boys. My word of Honor that I'll be back! And soon. I give you my word of honor that I will. And you, want to come with me? Yes, leave! Then, Lt. it's one less for you to worry. Quick! Let's go! Stop there! Don't you move! sergeant! -Put down the rifle. -Screw you! Lieutenant! Move a finger and you'll die. Who do you think we are? Who wants to come back doesn't take his personal stuff. I don't care for reinforcements. It's much better to wait... until we can move on our own. And we'll miss you, because it is a long way... and we need help. -You're gonna pay for this! -I hope so. If you send me to Gaeta is because we're both saved! We're all gonna die! I know! Listen, Lieutenant. Everyone wants me to die. What you're saying, Elenitzia! You want it too. Don't be stupid, please. -It's true. -No. -Yes, it will be better. -No. I so wish I could kill myself... but I can't. Be calm. Don't think of anything. Try to sleep now. If anyone wants to help me... we shouldn't... present ourselves... so badly... dressed... at someone's home. It doesn't bode well. We've always been together since we were kids. Always. Every day. At night we'd separate... and soon she phoned and talked, and talked... always happy, always laughing and now... she's dying. They should have shot me. I should die, not her! She didn't want to, I did! I do! I don't want to live! Don't want to live! No, it's not true. Not true. -It's not so. -I don't want to live. One day all this will end. Even if it looks impossible now. No one has the right to say "today I want to die because this is no life" What we are now does not matter. We'll forget. This won't seem real, you'll see. My God, what has he done? he shot her in the head like an animal. My God. You filthy coward! He'll kill all of us! Like an animal! I take full resposibility. It was a mercy killing. She asked for it and you know it. And so, I saved all of you... and me too. -Let's get out of here! -No! No! No, murderer! Murderer! -N?o! -Quiet! -No! -No! -Stop that! Don't you understand? Now she won't suffer anymore. I did it for her! I did it for you! If we stay here, we'll all die. What are you doing? Stop, are you crazy? I can't, I have to kill him. I have to kill him! You too. You're just like him! Major! Put down the pistol! Put it down! Look! Look what you've done. Poor Lieutenant. Now we can go. We can go! Yes. Alright. Now we leave. We're leaving. Gather your stuff! I'm in command! Come on, move. You too, Lieutenant. Come on! Move! Move! What are you waiting for? To the other side, move! our orders are to move opposite the church! She was hit in the ambush, but died later. She was killed. I finished her off, with a pistol shot. I did it to save all the others. She was suffering and we couldn't carry her. Whomever had the responsibility of command... would have the courage to do the same. I see, but I'll have to make a full report as per regulations. Ok. Sure. Lt., do you agree with the Major's report? Those are the facts, yes, but... I'd prefer if from now on... this gent continues the trip on his own. The Major will go with his comrades-in-arms... and you'll go ahead merrily with your whores. Ok, sorry but I've other things to do. We'll get back to this. The Black shirts weren't enough for just a bunch of rebels? On the contrary! For that they would be more than plenty... we're here only to avoid any... uselees and excessive damage to the civilians. And this is what happens to those who harbor traitors! Translate! All houses will be burned down... And you will be expelled... -Here they are! -Tell that we've got them! -They were there! -Move, crook! To the wall, bastards! Run! Run, murderer, run! Stand up! Bastard! Get up! Run, ahead! Scum! Go! Here! Line up! Ready? Commander, would you grant a death in the faith of Christ? Yes. One minute. Quick, Priest! Goodbye. Aim! Fire! Finish them off! Gather all our men! This way. Come, poor thing. You may go, thanks. Dr., could you take a look? Let me see. -Does it hurt? -No. -A bullet? -I don't know. I didn't notice. It's not serious. We'll tend for it. Nurse, come here! Mr. Lt., they are checking the papers. Oh God, the picking. Mr. Lt., since it's all the same, I'd rather stay here. and don't go further. Lt., how many stay here? Two, for the officers. The other will be me. Ok. Is the cast bothering you? This shell? Of course I'd be better in some nice pajamas... but compared to others I can't complain. For the last 3 or 4 months... I've been treated like a king by them little nuns... Imagine! They wash me from head to toe. Mr. Lieutenant! Mr. Lieutenant! Why you're in your work clothes? -What's up? -You, shut up! Mr. Lt., Eftikia has run away... and now they're searching everywhere... like she were a criminal. What happened? A Lt. Colonel call her to his room... and on the way there, and I don't know why... she spat on his face and took off. He yelled like mad and awoke the whole regiment. Now I don't know what may happen. but at night, with those savages... -Maybe I can help. -Bye. Ebe! May I know why you wanted to stay here... instead of going to Ocrida? You got me curious. At least, as long as I'm here... We can see each other from time to time. Maybe you'll convince me... about those fancy fabrics... Ok, bye. Let go... Go! Go! Who's keeping you here? Go to work. It's your job. But first... Move my pillows. Come... -Easy! -Fool! You can be sure... that if all goes well back in Prato... You'll quit this job. My word! Eftikia! Come quick! What happened? I'm sorry... but I can't. Listen, I tried to pay my dues... but I spat and ran away. Are you ok? Finally, yes. In the last 4 hours, thinking of you... I went nuts. My people... can't be treated like animals. It isn't to me that you have to say that. I know. That's why I'm here. Come. Dry yourself. Ain't you happy with what I did? Yes, but it should have been me to do it for you. You couldn't. I'm thankful that you didn't. Get dry. Why did you come here? I'm 24. I want to remember doing this one more time. You only hear the bells. In all villages I've been... over the last 2 years there were always horns with them. I can't forgive those who treated us so bad. You'll have to remember this... even if it turns me into a bad memory. I don't forgive. Neither should you. The worst isn't the deaths or destruction... because men die... but also are born. Cities can be rebuilt... and life doesn't end by violence. But the two of us... are here. We're the same age... but can't look each other in the eye. We've been humiliated. We talk like two old people... and in a few hours... will have to part. When this is all over... who'll give us back all those years? Will this end? Can it be forgotten? And all the things... we were taught to believe in since childohood? Kindness, dignity... respect for those who are weaker... the consideration for the others... No. I'll never accept that. I love you... and you understood how. But to say it today... under such conditions... is like saying a prayer for our dead son. Here you are. Goodbye. I never saw her again. And after the war... I came back to Greece with a dark feeling. I wouldn't find you. You had left without ever looking back... but I had the impression of seeing your face years later... in the last verses of a poem: "Just like when you turned around... and with the hand... in front of a cloud of hair... said goodbye... to enter the darkness". The End
