THE MAN WHO LOST HIS SHADOW You can't say that. - I can't? - No, you can't. - Why not? - It's just a theory. I worked like crazy all my life. I want to have some peace now. If I am here, it's not to act like a boss or an owner. I want to grow old and die here. I'm not talking about you. Yes, you are. You are making theories. It's my life, my body. Not yours. You learned things from books. - You too. - Yes, but not only from books. From real life, too. - I took risks. - So did I. Did you quit? - Or did they fire you? - Both. When you call your boss a moron, of course they fire you. So? Are you happy to be home? Are you happy? Well, I am. There we go. Your father is crazy. He is crazy. He left. Just like that. "I'll be back soon. Take care." Help me, please. Ask the people around you. Maybe someone knows. I don't know who else to call. Thank you very much. Thank you. I am tired. I'm tired to the core. Let me do it. You worked enough. I'm not the only one. And... when one sees how things are in life, that also tires me. But you, - you must keep your faith. - Me? Right. I have faith in many things. In you, for instance. People are funny and also tragic. We haven't found anything better. It's true, there are many great things. I also like clouds, cities and deserts. I like everything. Everything? But you have faith in nothing. You don't have faith in the world anymore. - For sure. - See? You gave up. Everybody gives up. Nobody has a clue. When you do things without a clue, when you don't know why you are doing it, people say it's like losing yourself. - It will come back with the sun. - No. Even with the sun, it won't come back. Paul, you're a man who lost himself. We're all like this now. No. I am not. I'm not. And you abandoned your wife. - I didn't. - Call her. I need some time alone. She will make a scene. I don't need that. - Or she will come here. - She's your wife. Don't you love her? You also have a son, and you vanished like that. I left a note. She knows I'll be back and that I want peace. This is about me and no one else. You're already too involved. Hello. You didn't call me back. I asked around me. No one knows anything. I don't know what to do. Maybe we should just wait. He will contact you or come home. I can't just wait. Don't you understand that? I can't. It's impossible. I don't like this at all. I can feel that... something is wrong. I must find something. I think I have a lead. His ex, Maria, the Spanish girl. She knows him well. Maybe she would find something. - Do you know her? - No. I don't want to ask her for help. Why not? She is history now. She is a nice girl. She will help you if she can. Go and see her. I have her address somewhere. Maria... I don't want to. I don't want to. - Hello. - Hello. Are you Maria? - Yes. - Hi, I am Paul's wife. Can I talk to you? Now? I just got out of bed. It's important. What's going on? - Is it serious? - Yes. Well, I don't know. Paul vanished. Vanished? Yes. Since you know him well, I thought you would know where I could find him. I haven't seen him in two years. I don't know. Come in. I need to get ready. RESTAURANT - CAFETERIA Look at your grandmother. - My grandmother? - Yes. The sea is my mother. So it is your grandmother. I'm sure he is there, in Spain. - I can't think of anything else. - Are you sure? - I know Paul. - Better than me, it seems. We were together for almost five years. He was still studying political science. A nice student. Brilliant. You're lucky to be his wife. Well, right now... What did you say it was called? Cabo de Gata? It's near Almer?a. Antonio manages a sort of restaurant there. - Has he ever mentioned us? - A little bit. But what would he do there? - Antonio is like a father to him. - A father? Are we talking about the same person? The old Spanish man with a bike workshop - in the street where Paul lived? - Yes. He is a wise man, a scholar. He's exactly the person Paul would be looking for. A wise man, a scholar. Paul is interested in history, and he likes bikes. At first, it was mostly about mechanics and having a few drinks. Paul realized that Antonio was a living memory, a human living memory. How so? His family were Communists. They left Spain after the civil war and came to France. He was still active among the Spanish exiles, always in politics. But Antonio is an expert. I really like him. You think he's with him? For sure. Three years ago, Antonio sold his store to go back to his home village. He was tired and sick and wanted to grow old there. I really like that place. Paul brought me there, back then. I will go. - Where? Cabo de Gata? - Yes. I will go. No, don't panic. Find Antonio's phone number first, so you can make sure he is there. No, I don't want to call him. - I'm going to my room. - Let's close then. - Good night. - Good night. One, two... Three, four. Lift your foot. Release. And one, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Release. Release. One, two... So? Is he back? No, he isn't. But I decided to go. Good. But I can't go alone. Won't you come with me? - You want me to come with you? - Yes. Are you kidding me? - Not at all. - Really? Don't you think it will be weird? Paul was the love of my life for a long time. He isn't anymore. Well... Do you still love him? Well, we didn't leave each other in a bloodbath. Listen, I can't leave alone. I can't do it alone. I don't like planes. I can't speak Spanish... I can't go alone. It's impossible. Won't you come with me? But it's absurd. Do you dream? - At night? - No, during the day. - Do you still have dreams? - Well, you saw me. See? You want me to believe dreams don't exist anymore? People don't dream anymore. You, not more than the others. Everybody is happy and complains about shit. They don't dream anymore. They flounder in disgrace. No, I do have dreams. Here, I can have dreams. Thanks to you. That's why I'm here. It's the last place where I can have dreams. Here. - With you. - Good. But don't dream too much. Don't you think we wallow in disgrace? What's going on? You'll have to do without me for a bit. Are you leaving? To where? - I have to go to Spain. - On vacation? - No. - What will you do? You are too curious. I will play a part. So you are a comedian now? What will we do? We don't know how to dance without you. Well, you will sing. Which play is it? It's a comedy or a tragedy. - Or both. - Yes. That sounds very fishy. Who are you leaving us for? What's his name? His name is... Paul. Yes. - Where were you? - In the desert. - It was splendid, superb. - Really? There is nothing there. - Nothing grows. - Exactly. It's not here to grow things. It's here for people like me. It's here for the blood, for belief. Or for desperate people who don't have faith anymore. Like you. Right. Say, can I borrow your car tonight? I don't want to use the bike. No, I have a party meeting tonight. - You're still in the party? - Of course. I am not a traitor. Come and help me with the dinner. Peel the potatoes. I bet you can't do anything in the kitchen. Not much. I can barely cook. That's not good. Then let's... Hello? One moment. - Antonio? Telephone. - Yes. Hello? Hello, it's Maria. Paul's friend. What is it? Good news? Yes, good news. Did you have a fight with your wife? No, not at all. Maybe we would have. Is she angry because you got fired? Of course not. But she was doing everything to make me feel better. I didn't want to feel better. I just wanted to hate everything. When it's like that, I need people who feel that way. But everybody loves each other. They are so happy. What a nightmare. What is it? - You think it's funny? - Yes. It is funny. How many chances of finding him there do we have? One out of ten? One out of a hundred? More or less. No. I would say nine out of ten. Nine out of ten? I don't have that much faith. - I'm ridiculous. - I find it funny. I don't. It's the game of love. Surely. It's not very important for you. For me, it's not a game at all. What would you do if you were me? I don't know. Nothing. I would have waited. You weren't really in love then. I was, crazy in love. What if he is not alone? If there is another woman? Well, three women! I don't dare imagine it. It would be a real bullfight. No. He is alone. When I ended up unemployed, the first thing I felt was huge relief. And gradually, I started to feel scared. Not because of money issues, but I felt like there was more than one way of saying things, more than one language for everyone, the only way we can communicate. You are somewhere else now. People are all the same. We are in a sort of soft totalitarianism. What did he reproach you for? You still write about economic problems, no? Among other issues. I wrote a series of articles they refused to publish. It was so much work. What was it about? It was like science fiction, the scenario of a disaster movie. It was a bit bold. But what was it about? That Gods and myths are dead, that history is nothing but a disaster in slow motion. That's bullshit. No, I'm totally serious. Come on, Paul. This is all bullshit. But let me finish. - What if communism is over... - It isn't. Maybe it hasn't really started. Maybe it will really come later. Whatever. What will happen when capitalism will be over? That's the disaster movie. It's the next century's scenario. Are you talking about the Great Satan? - The Great Satan? - Yes. That, over there. The American aircraft carriers. Of course. Well, then... Go and write elsewhere. We don't want your stories. You are young. Get moving. There is hope. No one has any choice. - Only one model is left. - That isn't true. You must keep going. Always ponder and always write. It's your job. My job is to speak up. They won't let me. I became mute, and that's what makes me depressed. You are a bit too fragile. Is there anything we can do? I am not so sure. I'm like a gumball: no more energy, no more desire. Zero. Nothing. My poor boy. - Not even for women? - Yes, still. All of them. A big fantasy. Asses and breasts. - Anything with anyone. - You see? You aren't dead yet. But you can't earn your living with that. Or you can become a pimp. No, I could never. It's in my head anyway. We are totally insane. What are we doing here? Suddenly being here made me realize how absurd the situation is. We will look so stupid. We were clowns before. Now, we are characters from a tragedy. Don't you think? Probably not the one you imagine. I'm sure we came here for nothing. - I have a bad feeling. - I don't think so. OCCUPIED Wait for a bit, please. Is this the place? Yes. Antonio! - This is Paul's wife. - Paul's wife. - How did you know he is here? - He is? Yes, he lives upstairs. But he left for the afternoon. He will be back tonight. - How did you know? - We guessed. Women always know. Just like in the song. "They aren't great at geography. "They never know where the south or north is. "But they always find their men." - Would you like to wait for him? - Yes, we will wait. You guessed right. You really are amazing. I'm relieved to know we didn't travel for nothing. Paul will be so surprised to see us here. He will be astonished. - You think he will be happy? - I don't know. I think so. I don't think he will be very happy to see you. He wants to be alone. And now, you arrived like this... Yes, it will be quite a mess. I will keep score. No. Let's take a small walk. I want to walk for a bit. We'll be on the beach. If it gets complicated, will you take my side? You're asking a lot of me. I am not part of this. I like him, but playing mediator isn't like me at all. What about solidarity among women? I would make things worse. But I will make an effort. When he sees us both... Every man dreams of having two women. Maybe, but they generally prefer seeing them separately rather than together. Am I right? Unless, eventually, - both women are friends. - Tough. Why not? You will see when Paul arrives. Two women will be a lot for him. It would be worse if we were friends. But we could be friends, don't you think? Yes, of course. But what about Paul? Well, we love or loved the same man, so we have something in common. On the contrary, it would be a good reason to hate each other. Why? Are the friends of our friends our enemies? The love of our love isn't our friend. Never. Wherever there is sex, there is violence. Death is lurking. Yes, but Paul and you are history. No? Fortunately. It can't be. What are you doing here? It can't be real. I came to see you. Who told you where I was? I didn't tell anyone. Was it you? Did you tell her, Antonio? Me? Never! I didn't tell anyone. I was the one who guessed. What are you doing here together? You knew each other? This must be a scheme. You are insane. That's unbelievable! I have the right to worry, no? To worry? What for? I needed to be alone. Is it so weird to want to be alone? Just once? Stop! You weren't in your right mind. You vanished. I didn't vanish to kill myself. Because you want to be alone, you just vanish and leave a note. I had no idea where you were. It's a bit irresponsible, don't you think? - You have a wife and a kid. - I told you it would be short. And the kid is at your mother's. Is he OK? - Is he OK? - He is fine. Exactly. He is fine. He goes there every day. - What are you doing here? - Nothing. I breathe. I ride a bike. I try to write a bit, to see more clearly. That's it. And does it work? Well, not anymore. Is my presence that disturbing? Here, yes. What a charming welcome. You really lost your sense of humor. I think it's quite a funny situation, no? Right now, I don't feel like laughing or making you laugh. He's making a tragedy out of it. What's tragic is peoples' inability to stay alone. Especially women. As if you need to be the other half of something. You feel lost when you're not with a man. Right. So I am clingy now. Maria, I'm going back to the hotel. Do you want to stay with him? No, I'll join you. I am tired. Was he like that with you? We weren't married. It doesn't matter. Do you think so? Well, I think you've done enough. What do you mean? I don't really see what more you can do for me. You were very nice to accompany me all the way here. Now, it's up to me. Maybe I can do something for Paul? For Paul? I really don't see what you can do for him. I don't know. We will see. You really want me to jump on the next plane? What am I to you? A conveyor? A travel agency? I want to stay for a bit. What will you do? Maybe this is just the beginning. And I really like this place. Maybe I have a part to play in this. I really don't see which one. Me neither. Let's wait and see. We will see. You really don't like to wait without doing anything. I don't. I don't know what I'm waiting for. - What about you? - I'm not waiting for anything. I'm just enjoying it. Traveling is all about absence, ladies. Absence... is abandonment. Absence is the opacity of the world. It is here, and we do not know it. We don't understand it. That's the best part. I wanted to be absent. Never mind that. - Are you that sad about it? - I am. You came at a bad time. I didn't need you right now. I didn't want us two together. But luckily, we are three. Three is a good number. - You're joking again, so you're fine? - I'm not joking. How are you? I'm fine. What about you, Maria? How are you? I feel great. Well, great. The women are fine. There you go. My office. My dump. Fifty weeks in Paris with you, two weeks here with myself. Is that a contract? Is this part of your ploys? My ploys? Where is this going? What do you want me to think about all that? What do you want with me? Nothing. What are you imagining? I'm not the one making trouble. And there are two of you. What's Maria doing here? She accompanied me. I'm talking about me. I'm trying to understand. It's not about you. Really? Yet, it affects me too. - It does. - No need for that. I'm just spicing up my everyday life, nothing more. It has nothing to do with you, OK? I would appreciate it if it had something to do with me. Why make it more complicated? I'd like you to share your problems with me. It's normal, no? Some things are useless to share. It only multiplies them. Like problems, for instance. Right, problems... If you share them with someone, it divides them by half. It makes them lighter. It doesn't multiply them. That's also called "love." You're mixing it up. Not everything is about feelings. That's not the issue. Then what is it? Work? You will find work again. It's not that simple. What is this place? Fifty years ago, there was a gold mine there. This was the miners' village. Silence. What are we doing here? I'm not a tourist. - I'm not on vacation. - Me neither. Why did you come here? - I came to know. - Know what? I want to understand. I don't understand. - I want to understand it all. - It's simple. I needed a few days of solitude, elsewhere. I also can feel like running away. But with you. - You don't have any secrets? - No, I don't keep anything from you. - Do you have secrets? - Of course. Men are so selfish. We're all alone in our own skin. It can be great. Sometimes not. I learned to be soft and nice. And now, I want to scream. Go ahead. Scream. I want you to touch me. You haven't touched me since I arrived. Not even one look. Look at me. Did you hire Maria? She is nice. She is helping. Some days, I really can't do it anymore. It's the fatigue. My engine has been going for millions of miles. It's damaged. Millions of miles on a bike. I've only participated in amateur races. They are the great champions. Look. Berrendero, Bahamontes. - Friends of mine. - Really? Yes. I have autographs. "To Antonio Bertia Ballera." That's me. What are we doing here? Will you stay longer? It makes no sense. Let's pack and head home tomorrow. OK? I don't know why you're staying. This is where I want to be right now. - Not at home. - This is nonsense. You're fine upstairs while I'm in a hotel room? Are you kidding me? Then stay. I'll leave tomorrow. If you're leaving, let's have a party. All of us together. We will dance, drink, and listen to some music, OK? Aren't you a bit old for that? Never. Anne, should we have a party? If you like. We will listen to my friend, Juan Gomez. But we need to look elegant. It's the old world, the ancient world. I'm starting to understand what you're looking for. It's this. - This? - The old world. The old world? From before. Before... I don't know, before TV, for instance? Maybe. And they're from that world. How does it feel to lose your dreams? It happens to everyone, always. But we haven't lost everything. Not at all. We can't go any deeper in the shit. It's impossible. We can't be that unworthy. - It's impossible. - What isn't possible? We're not here to debate. We're here to have fun. We are with two beautiful women. You see? Paul thought we can separate everything. On one side, the problems in his head. On the other, life with others. But it doesn't work. He speaks to himself in his head, and life catches up with him. Women catch up with him. You were taught a lesson. Next time, I will go to the moon. - Should we dance? - Where? - Shall we? - Let's go. Aren't you tired? I am exhausted. Antonio, won't you walk back with me? I am tired too. - But I'm thirsty. - That's it. Let's have one last drink and go. - OK? - Sorry. - At my place. - Right. - And I'll walk the girls back. - No. I'm really too tired. Go without me. Come on, let's have one last drink all together. No, the hotel is right there. I will walk back. I'm going. Stay with us. - Bye! - Let's go. - Good night. - Let's go. - See you tomorrow! - Good night. I'm going. I'm exhausted. Maria, should I walk you back? Well? I'm staying. You're staying? Paul! Close the bar. You're staying? - Yes, I will sleep here. - Sleep here. - Antonio! - Yes? Coffee, please. For me as well. You don't look good. This time, it will be the bullfight. - How do you say that in French? - No, come on. What a pity. I could stage a great play here, with a lot of passion and blood flowing. But no. Not even. I wouldn't be too sure about that. This could be the beginning of the play, of the tragedy. We don't need anyone to die. We are civilized people. Exactly. Who will tell her what happened last night? You? Or me? Why would you tell her? I like your wife. I don't want to lie to her. I can't. So, will it be you or me? Neither. You can't be serious. I'm totally serious. You are crazy. If you don't want to, I will do it. But she'll know about it today. What is that good for? Maria is right. It's the fair thing to do. This is bullshit. I have enough problems like this. What are you playing at? Nothing. - I'm doing it for her. - Right. It amuses you. It's because I like you both. And if she strangles you? Paul, I don't think she would do that. Go ahead then. Go, tell her. Give her all the details. How did I take you? On the desk, from behind, right? No need for details. You are taking risks. It would be less risky if you lived alone. You really are crazy. - You can't do this. - I can. - Fuck, it can't be! - But it's real. Where is Maria? I don't understand. I missed my flight waiting for her. Why didn't you fly without her? Are you crazy? She is in the hotel. She was looking for you. She wanted to talk to you. It's important. Paul, take her to the hotel. Thanks, Antonio. No need. I have a taxi waiting. Taxis are expensive. What's going on here? I don't get it. Fuck! It can't be. It's not that bad. It's not lethal. Not for you. To think I made you come here. I should've known. It wasn't deliberate at all. We all had too much to drink last night, and the old me resurfaced. That's all. It was a one-time thing. He loves you. What a weird way of showing it. It's disgusting. You are disgusting. And Paul is a moron. I don't think so. I hate you. Really? What did you expect of me? A hug? It doesn't matter. Our bodies don't belong to anyone. Right. Let's all sleep with anyone then. It's as if you never loved anyone. I did. And I was awfully jealous. But I've had enough. Love is about jealousy. That's normal. That's how it is. I know. Hey... Did he tell you to stay, or did you decide to stay? I don't know. It just happened. We didn't decide anything. Disgusting. You know what I realized this morning when I woke up? I realized it was the last time in this lifetime that I would make love with Paul and that he would now be out of my life forever. I felt so cold. I hope you're not too sad. I am. But he is yours. Thanks for that. He is a moron. Stop following me. There are people here. Stop! I don't care! You are a moron! Stop! Stay here in your shitty dump with your shitty dancer and fuck her whenever you want to. Don't stay here like that. - Go and get her. - Later. I'll wait for her to calm down. Where are you going? This is a dead end. Come on, get on. Get on! - Come! - Just leave me alone! Anne, get on. Take me to the hotel. I don't want to see any of you. Get on. Come with me. Women bother you, right? No, I usually prefer women to men. I like women. Right, you like their asses. Yes, that too. But men can sometimes be more fun. Women are too serious. We have to be. We're the ones fixing things - while you fuck everything up. - Oh, oh, oh... We spend our time fixing your mistakes, - our lifetimes. - Really? I thought it was the opposite. You're always running after men, you women. You like drama and tragedies. When there is none, you stir some up. Are you kidding me? You're acting as if nothing happened. Nothing! You don't care about me. You don't care about anything. You're totally indifferent to how I feel. You slept with her, and here I stand. And you don't care. Faithfulness is important to me, mentally and physically. - For me, too. - It doesn't seem so. Only crows are faithful for a lifetime. You know it. No, I didn't. Well, I'm telling you now: we aren't crows! Maybe, but it causes damage. Not here. Not with Maria. It's in the past. Right, it was last night. How convenient, that you don't take any risks with her. It's convenient for you too. I'm not the one who brought her here. I didn't do it for that. And I liked her. Don't touch me. Fuck, don't make it a big deal. We are leaving tomorrow, Antonio. You don't look good. You should stop working. Stay at home. What would I do at home all day? Here, I get to see people. What about you? Did you make peace? For now, yes. Well, I think so. No more war. This place is different from home. Here, we have no enemies. We're all united. The rich against the poor. The era of the insurrection of the rich against the poor. You didn't even write that. I can still quote people. Good thing there's the Sex Wars. The Sex Wars? That doesn't count. I thought I taught you something. You taught me many things. Even how to be a prostitute. A prostitute? A prostitute. Maria left without a word. She is gone. Maybe it's better that way. She doesn't like farewells. Do you still love her? Maybe. I don't know. We drifted apart. And you came. Do you still love me? You asked me ten seconds ago. And it's a bad question. A getaway has nothing to do with feelings. You women are lucky. You are made of one piece, one unique block. You don't separate everything. We men, we separate everything into small boxes: matters of the heart, matters of the world, matters of feelings, matters of sex. Always additions, subtractions, divisions... It's complicated and easy at the same time. It makes you stronger but also more fragile. So, in which box am I now? It's all mixed up. That's what you want. It bothers you. It's closed. That's weird. That's not normal. He never closes. Let's visit him. Antonio is dead. What do you want to do? Talk to his wife? Yes. The taxi is still there. Don't miss your flight. I will wait for the funeral. - You will wait for the funeral? - Yes. Could you get my bag? DIGITAL RESTORATION DONE WITH A SCAN OF THE ORIGINAL MOVIE DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY: JOS?
