Cops! Sarge Khoy, wait here. Don't let anyone in. The transfer of inmates from overcrowded prisons to a newly built prison is nearly finished. The problem of overcrowding has existed for years and indicates a larger number of wrongdoers in the present social context. Statistics show that the inmate population increases 30% every year. Telephone for you. What? For you! I'll be right there, dear. For your information, both new and old staff members, must comply with the rules, which I want to emphasize are 'iron' rules. Reading and chanting in any language is strictly prohibited. Food must not be given in granular form. No talking to the inmates. No inmates are allowed to touch you. This is for the sake of your own safety. And I do hope. All rules will be strictly followed. It's his ill fortune. He's a yong boy, isn't he? I'd like to help. Do as I told you, he'll be better. Take a boiled pig's head, rice dumplings... five kinds of fruit... liquor... and 36 joss sticks to make a spirit offering outdoors. Focus your mind on me and... I'll send 'them' to help you. How is he, dear? Dad... What's next? I need a few more things for the ceremony. You can't! Not enough! Time to go home. Your shift is over. Where the hell are you going? What stuff? He must have gone to his hometown. Good. Let's finish it. I've been waiting too long. See you in the south. Take care. Help me, son. Why are you following me? Go back to your damn father! I don't want to hurt you! Itti! Is this what you're looking for? Sarge, you go that way! Hey! Freeze! Yai! Yai! Yesterday he got a good shot. I saw he got it. Lt. Santi gave him a full load! You know, with a shotgun! He fell down like shit! Goddammit! Then that asshole got up and walked away. Hey, he's a real one! An invincible one! I saw a tattooed tiger on his back, too. Sarge Peed! Let's go. I'll pay later. I believe Yai is still in this province, sir. I have a sense that he is one of the invincible. - Are you scared? - No, I'm not. Not at all. Cops are tough for sure. What did she do? She dumped broken pieces of alms bowls in front of my house. I said I didn't do it! What's with you? What do you mean you didn't? You made my son like a shit! I won't let you do this to me! I won't let you do this to me, either! I won't let you do this to me, either! Be silent! Excuse me, Lieutenant. A cop from Bangkok is here for you. Sarge, please bring me the document. Yes, sir. Please. Yes, sir. Take a seat. May I? It's all right. Yes, sir. Your inspector is busy in Bangkok and you're in charge here, right? Yes, sir. The criminal I'm after... broke out of a prison yesterday. All evidence shows that... he is a local. He'll come back here, anyway. Whatever you do, do it in silence. Reporters have quick noses! Yes, sir. Actually, you didn't have to come this far. It's all right. I've come here for pleasure, too. Please... You don't have to speak. I know. You're running out of power, aren't you? Criminal File Division. May I speak to Sub. Lt. Winai? Winai speaking. It's me, Santi. Do me a favour, mate. Sir, may I have your hair? Why does Yai have to come here, Sarge? He's one of the necromancers. He must be here anyway. Have you seen anything like this? - Someone gave it to me. - What is this, Sarge? It's great! Look, this is not the laymen's business. Please leave. Everyone has come here to retrain from suffering. I myself can do nothing different from what you've done. This is Sangha's business. Everyone has his own karma. Please be in your world. What about present karmic misdeeds? Can you change them at all? Since you and the rest of us were all born to suffer for karmic misdeeds, then what's the difference? Tell them to send backup. Suspect found. Yes, sir. Itti! Freeze! I'm a cop! What's up? Please come with me. I didn't do anything. I've just come here to pay my respects to the Buddha. You must come with me! You have the wrong man. I've never harmed anybody. And I don't want to. Keep your gun away. Shut up. Lieutenant! What happened, Lieutenant? You're now much better. You'll get your health back in a few days. Why have I been here? You've been unconscious for 3 days! I remember nothing. The last time... You take some rest. I'll see you later. All right. Hello. Hi, mate. The case you've worked on is quite something. Itti was a 'Make My Day' cop in a unit famous for justifiable homicide. Over dozens of cases, for god's sake! The three persons involved were Lt. Col. Teerasak, Col. Tosapon, who died weeks ago, and another one, whom I don't know... His name is... Hello? How are you, Lieutenant? I'm all right. I've been so worried about you. I was afraid he'd put you under his evil power. Come with me tonight, Sarge. Yes, sir. So I'm just on top? Just follow what I've told you. Would you like some? No. Go ahead. What are you doing around here? Waylaying bad guys, sir. Are there any bad guys around here? Come for a ride with me? Cigarette? No, sir. It happened long time ago. We were in the same unit then. In every operation. We found necromancers with evil power. Itti was never afraid. He had talismans for himself. To catch the necromancers, we had to remove their power. But then Tosapon and I found... Itti had gone too far with it all. His obsession was beyond control. Sarge Khoy, wait here. Don't let anyone in. Where's the money? Asshole! Bastard! Necromancer? Damn you! Let him go. Let this bastard go? Why? Are you killing him? I beg you let him go to jail. I'm fed up with you! With your justifiable killing! What the hell do you mean? Are you killing him? Why not? Why can't kill him? I'll shoot you if you don't stop being crazy! Do you think I fear you two? Almost all mystic symbols have disappeared! There are no mystic characters left in his old cell! Some say he can erase mystic symbols! No one knows he broke out. It's confidential. You'd better withdraw from this case. I also fax you a map of that Sarge's house. Believe me. It's too scary! Nonsense! Scared of what? I'm really scared. I'm really worried about you. All right. I'm fine. No worries. Anybody home? Hello? Who are you? Get out! Are you Sarge Khoy? I give up! No! Don't hurt me! I give up! I won't hurt you. Calm down, Sarge. I'm a cop. I know nothing! I give up! Get out! - What happened? - I don't know. Get out! Tell me. I can help you. Get out! I give up! What's that, Sarge? No! Don't take it from me! No! Don't take it from me! Get out! I give up! I give up! Help! Get out! What you told me is not what was reported. You've been reading this book for days. Where did you get it from? What's it got to do with this case? It was my father's. I've had it for years, but I'm just interested. Have you ever worked on any case with necromancers? Never, sir. Although I've heard about them. But you once told me you don't believe in this. I don't. I believe that they create superstition to cover up corruption! Whenever money is involved, nobody can be trusted. Look, we still have plain rice and vegetables! Hope this will make us millionaires one day! Here's stir-fried luffa from my favourite cook. Go ahead. I don't like it. I've seen you eat it before. Are you one of the necromancers? They don't have these vegetables. First, luffa. Second, squash. And, third, gourd. Such vegetables are believed to dispel evil. It's bitter, you ass! Lieutenant! Lieutenant! What's up, Sarge? Sir please hurry here. We found Yai. You wait where you are. I'll be there. Shit! Turn yourself in now! You're surrounded. Lieutenant! Hey! Lieutenant! You're quite good. You could defeat Yai. You're very good. What do you want? Take this as warning or whatever. There're not many paths to take. Only two, in fact. You need to make your own choice. Anyway, don't take my path. Don't you preach! I'll never be like you! Never! I swear I'll drag you back to jail! You won't let it over, right? Are you sure you won't regret it later? You know where the money is, right? You think you'll get the money... ...and walk away, just like that? So it's money we're talking about, right? How could you get in here? You forgot something? Oh, here you are. Now you disappear! He will show up in any minute. What I want is not money. So what exactly do you want? Don't forget my husband is a cop. Don't think I fear you. You've got everything now, right? Remember what you owed me the other day? So I'm just on top? What else do you want me to do? Not now. I'll find you. If your tip works, I'll do anything. No one answered. Should we go up for a video now? May I see the manager, please? Sarge! Sarge! Lieutenant, they're up to get Itti! Everyone! You can shoot to kill! This is an order! What's the noise? Itti! Itti! Teerasak! How the hell are you? I'm fine. And you? How the hell was jail? Not so good. A dirty dog kept dogging me! What the hell do you want? - I want to close the damn case! - So do I. I'm fed up with your damn face! If your powers were good, I wouldn't have caught you so easily! Bastard! You spat on my mother? What the hell are you doing? You shot him for what? He spoke bad about my mother. And what else did he tell you? What the hell do you mean? I mean what I said. Do you think I'll grab all money? Do you think I fear you two, huh? Don't be so glad. I won't let you die that easily. I'll raise you as my watchdog ghost. Don't you know we're the same kind of bastard! Help! I'm no longer invincible! Look! I'm no longer invincible! Sir! Stop it! Put the knife down. - Sarge, we need backup. - Yes, sir. I told you. I told you to stay out of this. Don't know... ...good guys don't belong here? Sir! What exactly do you want? You haven't come here only for me, have you? You want to know where the money is, right? What the hell are you talking about? That looks familiar. It was Yai's, wasn't it? So you want to be like him... or you want to be like me? Damn you, you nutter! So don't be a damn nutter like me! Sarge! Sarge, are you all right? Lieutenant. Hang on, Sarge. Sarge! Lt. Santi. It ran up to his back! Turn over! Hang on, sir. How are you, son? Do you feel better? Yes, I do. You were lucky. He still had mercy. He didn't want to take your life. What he did to me is merciful? Yes, If he really wanted to take your life, you would be dead by now. And even I wouldn't be able to help you. But he's a bad guy. Let him go, son. You're out of his league. Could you please do me a favour? Sir. Sarge, check the ceremony day for me. Are you still after him? Although you don't know what he is. Although you don't know if he's human. I don't give a damn! Whether he is a saint or monster, I'll drag him back to jail! Could you please do me a favour? Do you think I fear you? You old shit! You've already chosen, haven't you? Is it too hard to be a good man? Are you killing me? Give it back to me. There it is! Don't you see it? I give up! No! I'm a cop. I have to arrest you anyway. You haven't come here only for me, have you? Necromancer? Damn you! Are you damned good? Bastard! Are you damned good? Are you damned good? Necromancer? Damn you! Necromancer? Invincible? Are you damned invincible? Invincible? Are you damned invincible? Invincible? There're not many paths to take. Only two, in fact. You need to make your own choice. You won't let it over, right? Are you sure you won't regret it later? Anyway, don't take my path.
