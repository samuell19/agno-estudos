And it burns, burns, burns ? The ring of fire ? The ring of fire... [ROSE PANTING] DAHLIA: Only the dark one opens and closes the door to Silent Hill. Please. I don't know what's happening. Do you know what's going on here? [GASPS] My daughter. I'm looking for my daughter. I'm afraid that she's been hurt. We've all lost our children. Our light. DAHLIA: They deceived me. They're evil. They're hate. They hurt my child. They did terrible things to her. Alessa. This is my daughter, Sharon. She sleepwalks, so you have to be careful but if you see her, please, tell her to wait for me. Yes, she's mine. No. It's mine. It's mine. It's mine! DAHLIA: It's mine! Get off me! [YELLS] Into the fire, she swallowed their hate. [?] CHRISTOPHER: Hi there. Yeah. Listen, uh, my wife, she came through here last night. Maybe you saw her? Daughter worked night shift. Actually, she was heading for this place, Silent Hill. How do I get there? Heh. You don't. Town's closed down 'cause of the coal fire still burnin' underground, you know? Breathe enough of them fumes, oh, bound to kill ya. Okay. Where's the turnoff? [RAPID FOOTSTEPS] [?] Sharon? [BEEPS] [WHISPERS] Come on. [LINE RINGING] [ENGINE SPUTTERING] [RECORDED MESSAGE] Hi, this is Chris. Please leave a message. [BEEPS] Christopher, it's me. I'm.. I'm in Silent Hill. I'm sorry, I made a mistake. Sharon's lost, but I think I know where she is, so I'm going in solo to look for her. [SIGHS] I'm not okay, All right? I need your help. Please, please hurry. [BEEPS] [ENGINE SPUTTERS] Fuck. Come on! CYBIL: Ma'am, I want you to put both hands on the wheel. Put both hands on the wheel. Where's the little girl, ma'am? Please, my daughter, she's gone. I need your help. Get out of the car. What? Move it. Huh? Jesus, what are you doing? You're under arrest. What? You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you. I don't think you understand, there's something weird going on here. My daughter, Sharon, she's in danger. If you really cared, you wouldn't have sped off. Listen to me, she's ill. She sleepwalks. Just calm right down. I'm gonna find the little girl. [RADIO BEEPS] Officer Bennett to base, over? Base, do you copy, over? Shit. You're bleeding. Cracked my head on the road pretty good when my bike went down. Musta been out for a while. You all right to walk? Sure. Then it looks like we'll be hiking back to Brahams. What? You're goin' back to the station. Are you kidding? Nope. Have you heard a single word I've said? Yeah, I heard.. Have you heard a single word I've said? I'm sure she's at the school, we just need to turn around... ROSE [DISTORTED OVER PHONE]: Silent Hill.. Sorry.. [STATIC] --think I know where-- --going-- I'm not okay! I need your-- Your help-- Hurry! [CUTS OUT] Sorry, sir, this road is closed. You'll have to turn around. I'm looking for my wife, she may have come through here. Uh, she.. She drives a Jeep Liberty. Silver, Ohio plates. [CLICKS] Sir, this man's wife was driving the Jeep. MAN: Bring him down. Come on. You've seen her? Where is she? Inspector Thomas Gucci. Enjoying the weather, are ya? For God's sake, I'm trying to find my wife. I know, hang on a second. Now that vehicle you were talkin' about, we found it. Really? It's at the end of the bridge here, but it's empty. Got no indication anyone's come under any harm. Good Christ. Now, you mind telling me what the hell your wife's doin' all the way up here, Mr. uh..? Da Silva, Chris Da Silva. My pleasure, Chris-- Look, the faster we start lookin', the faster we're gonna find her. All right, hold your horses, hold your horses, Chris. I've also got a missing deputy. And knowing Officer Cybil Bennett the way I do, she's probably out there looking for your wife and your daughter. Bobby, make sure no one comes through that barricade. We're gonna get our asses up to Silent Hill and take a look. BOBBY: Yes, sir. While Chris here tells me what's goin' on. She disappeared yesterday... Let's go! CYBIL: Why were you coming up here in the middle of the night? ROSE: I thought it would help her. CYBIL [SCOFFS]: You people. You get off the highway from whatever big city, bringin' all your sick problems with you. ROSE: Why aren't you listening to me? CYBIL: We had a guy come up here two years ago. Snatched a little boy from a rest stop, dropped him into a mine vent. I never wanna see anything like that again. Look, I don't know what you're thinking here, but you're not helping. There is no way I would ever harm my own daughter. How do I even know she is your daughter? Come on. [?] What the hell? [RUSTLING] Okay. Now do you see what I'm talking about? Will you take these handcuffs off me? No. Get walking. There's a fire lookout tower on the far side of Toluca Lake. It should have a radio. Fuck you, you stupid cop. This place is completely cut off. You got no idea what's goin' on. Hey! Hey, you up there! I'm a police officer! [HUMMING] [CRACKLING] What's going on? [CREATURE RETCHING] CYBIL: What is that? Stand back. [RADIO CRACKLING] ROSE: Jesus Christ, shoot it. [GROWLING] [GROWLING] Stay where you are! Stop!

[FLOORBOARDS CREAKING] GUCCI [OVER SPEAKER]: Mrs. Da Silva, I am an officer of the law, and I will take you to safety. Mrs. Da Silva, I am an officer of the law, and I will take you to safety. Why don't you let me do that? Ninety percent of the time, Chris, when a wife takes a run, she takes the daughter to a place like this, I'd say she's damn mad at her husband. You like hauling skeletons out of your family closet? No, not all the time, but we're drivin' on top of 'em right now. Coal fire's still burning underneath. See the barbershop over there? It used to be my father's. CHRISTOPHER: Your father? Aw, he's dead. November '74, when the fire caught. They tried to evacuate this place as quick as they could, but it was hellish, people were dyin' and disappearing.. Hell, they couldn't even find half the bodies. That was the end of Silent Hill. These were good people. Most of 'em. Some, you might say, deserved it. A little bit. [DISTANT BANG] [GASPS] Sharon! [THUMPING] [?] [CREAKS] Sharon. [SOFTLY] Where are you hiding?

We're gonna go this way. Chris, come on. She was here. No, no, she wasn't here. She was here. I know it. [SCREAMS] [CRYING] Come on. Come on. Let's keep looking.

What the fuck is going on? All right, I know this is crazy. I know. We gotta calm right down, because my kid is not here and I've gotta find her before this happens again. Oh, God. I don't even know where to start. I found this. It's from a hotel. I don't know where it is, but she is in this hotel. Hotel? Hey. It's gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay. Now, don't be trying anything, Chris, all right? We got men up here all night long. We're gonna find your wife, we're gonna find your daughter. Can't have civilians wandering around on their own. You're not telling me everything. What really happened up here? Just let it rest in peace. WOMAN [ON PHONE]: Directory assistance. Toluca County Archives, please. One moment. [LINE RINGS] WOMAN 2: Archives? Yeah, listen, um.. Do you have the records there from Silent Hill? Uh, which records, sir? The police records? Sorry, sir, those records are confidential. No, no, I..I can't.. No, listen, I.. Sorry, sir, I can't access that information. Listen, goddamn it. I.. Sir, I can't.. This is an emergency. I can't help you. [?] [ROSE PANTING] They used to say this place was haunted. I think they were right. ANNA: Help! No! Stay away! ROSE: Come on. ANNA: Stay away, sinner. Get back! Hey. Hey, it's here. DAHLIA: Faith is our destroyer. Faith has brought us doom. Get back! Hey, hey! Get back! Hey, stop! Think you of they who cast the first stone. Lambs without a shepherd, shepherd without a flock. It's your sins which hold you here. Stop your lies! Calm down. Calm down, it's okay. We're not gonna hurt you. She's gone. What's your name? Anna. My name is Anna. What's going on here, Anna? Who was that? ROSE: I've seen her before. ANNA: Dahlia was cast out. Not even the darkness wants her. She's lost her daughter too. What? ANNA: Sinners deserve to lose their spawn. What are you doing here, Anna? Mother needs more food. You mean there are other people here? Christabella keeps us safe. ROSE: Anna. We take refuge in the church. ROSE: Anna, listen to me. I've lost my daughter. She's all alone. ROSE: Can you imagine how frightened she must feel? Tell me, have you seen her? Do you know where she is? Mm-mm. If she has faith, she might survive. If not... I'm taking this. Have you seen this? I've seen it at the school. It's on all of the buildings the elders of my elders built. It's a symbol of our unity, a symbol of our faith. Rose, look at this. ROSE: What is it? Just like yours. Where'd you find it? They're all over the floor. Rose. Check this out. What number did you take this from? One-eleven. We gotta go to room 111. [TICKING] [SOFTLY] Gucci. WOMAN: Directory assistance. Yeah. Toluca County Orphanage, please. One moment, please. Yes, I have that information.. Yeah. Can you give me that address? [?] ANNA: We are wandering far from refuge here. Let's keep her with us. She's all we got. There's no room 111. [SOFTLY] The first burning. What is it, Anna? The first burning. Before the town had a name. The elders of my elders kept us pure. The founders of this town were witch hunters. ANNA: Burning the witch held back the darkness. It stopped the apocalypse. It's here. ROSE: There's a room in here. [CANVAS RIPPING] Look at this. Here. ROSE: Damn. [METAL CLINKING] What is this place? I don't know. We're in the next building. Some factory, maybe. CYBIL: Looks like there was a fire. Hey. Rose! [GIRL WHIMPERING] Who are you? [GIRL WHIMPERING] It's okay. Don't be scared. I promise I'm not gonna hurt you. [GRUNTS] Rose? [METAL CREAKING] [GIRL WHIMPERING] Okay. Come on. Come on. [SOBBING] It's okay. Hey. Hey. It's okay. [?] It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. Oh, my God. You could be her twin. Are you Alessa? Where's my Sharon? Look at me. I'm burning. [GASPS] CYBIL: Rose? Rose? My God. How'd you get over there? Where is she? [MUTTERING] Grab onto it. Now swing back around. Okay. CYBIL: Are you all right? Yeah. What the hell were you doing over there? You're gonna get yourself killed. I think I just saw Dahlia's daughter. She was the one that brought us here. What are you talking about? She was the one that made me crash my car. Alessa. We don't say her name. That's the seal, isn't it, Anna? The symbol of your faith? Something terrible happened here. We have to leave. We have to leave! The darkness is coming! Let's go. CYBIL: Let's go! ANNA: The church isn't far. Run. Run! Rose, come on! Rose! [BIRDS SQUAWKING] [ALARM BLARING] Hurry! Rose. Come! CYBIL: We gotta go. [ALARM BLARING] Rose, come on. I've seen this. [ALL PANTING] [?] CYBIL: Rose, let's go! Cybil! Rose, come on. Cybil! DAHLIA: You run not towards sanctuary but from your fears. Do not join the others! They are deceivers. They are damned. We gotta get inside. No! They are wolves in the skin of sheep. They brought about their own hell. They'll take you with them. Oh! Filth and lies! Hey! CYBIL: Stop it! Please. I've seen your daughter. I've seen Alessa. It's coming! She's dead, isn't she? Fire doesn't cleanse. It blackens. Listen to me. Rose, hurry! She looks exactly like Sharon. She brought us here, didn't she? Why? What does she want? Evil wakes in vengeance. Be careful what you choose. [ALARM FADING] [CYBIL PANTING] [?] CYBIL: Rose! [BELLOWING] [ANNA SCREAMS] [GROANING] [GROWLING] Oh, God, no. Witches! Destroy the witches! [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] No. No. No. No, we're lost. [GUNSHOT] CHRISTABELLA: This is a sanctuary. [GUN CLICKS] [SOBBING] Please, Christabella, they lured my Anna. They gave her to the fiend. Eleanor, you must remember that Anna went against our laws. She went alone outside into the devil's playground. She was not the responsibility of these two strangers. We'll deal with them later. Now we must pray. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [ORGAN PLAYING] CHRISTABELLA: And then I saw them from whose presence Earth and heaven fled away. And no home was left to them. ALL: And then I saw them from whose presence Earth and heaven fled away. And no home was left to them. CHRISTABELLA: And I saw the dead, the great and the small, and they were judged according to their deeds. ALL: And I saw the dead, the great and the small, and they were judged according to their deeds. And anyone's name not found written in the book of life, they will be thrown into the lake of fire. [HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING] NUN AND GIRLS: And now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take. Amen. All right, girls, into bed. Quickly now. No better place to be on a rainy night. In you go, Lindsey, that a girl. You've got your bear, that's a girl. No. No talking after lights are out. [INDISTINCT WHISPERS] Good night, children. And God bless. I'm sorry, Sister Margaret, this really can't wait. I can't imagine why. Nine years ago, a baby was left outside this orphanage. My wife and I were the ones who adopted her. I'm very happy for you, Mr. Da Silva, but I can't give out information on our children. Look. That girl, she looks exactly like my daughter. I can't help you, I'm sorry. It's late. She must be 40 now. Where can I find her? This story isn't hers alone, but all of ours. GUCCI: You got yourself somethin'. You know what you got now, Chris? How 'bout breakin' and enterin'? And by the looks of this,a little assault, as well. Thank you, Thomas. This can't go any farther. It won't, Sister. You know, I have some 12-year-olds who, uh, cover their tracks better than you do. What's this? Look, Gucci, do you know her? Is that my daughter's birth mother? Huh? Look, turn around. What are you doing? [HANDCUFFS CLICK] GUCCI: I knew that girl. I did. I was told she didn't make it through the night. The night of the fire. The night of the big fire in Silent Hill. There were these people. These fanatics. What they did to that child was terrible. That was 30 years ago, and it's over now. Not as far as I'm concerned. What's it gonna be, city boy? I.. I can put you in jail, or you can go home. And that's your definition of justice, huh? There are many different forms of justice, Chris. See, you've got man's, God's, and even the devil's. Certain forms you just can't control. So I want you to go home now to your nice warm bed and let me deal with this town and what has happened over the last 30 years. Okay? End of story. CHRISTABELLA: Tell me first how you got here. Honestly, I don't know how I got here. Right now, I've lost my little girl, and all I know is that I'm supposed to be in this church. Are you a person of faith? I love my daughter. That's not what I asked. Who are you to judge? We judge because the souls of history hang in the balance. Because our faith has never failed us. Our faith keeps the darkness of hell at bay. Then use your faith to help me find my little girl. Only the demon knows where she is. Then tell me, where do I find this demon? No one has ever returned from the core of the darkness where the demon lies in wait. She's not gonna help us. Let's just go. If you wish to face the demon to find your daughter, I won't stop you. Christabella, they can't go down.. Silence, Adam. Perhaps your faith will protect you. Perhaps not. [MAN GROANS] If you don't wanna do this... I'll understand. Sharon's adopted, but I'm her mother. I knew that from the moment I first laid eyes on her. She's lucky to have you. Mother is God in the eyes of a child. [?] [DOOR SLAMS] Quiet. We're in his domain now. Look at this map. Memorize it. Your memory may save your life. Do you see this room? ROSE: Yep. That is where the darkness lies. The demon is in the bowels of this building. It hides behind the face of an innocent. CYBIL: You mean a child? Don't believe your eyes. Your eyes will lie to you. Faith is the only truth. I will pray for you, Rose. But I won't expect you and your friend to return. Goodbye. Adam? [WHISPERS] Left. Right. Left. Left. Right. Right. Left... CHRISTABELLA: Take them to the lower level. ADAM: In the basement? Do it, then return. ROSE: Left. 3A. But.. ROSE: Right. 4A. I said do it. Left. Left. Right. CYBIL: Rose? Rose? Left. Right. Left. Left. Rose, she's killing you. Rose! Let me do this. I need to do this. [CREAKS] MAN: Take this. They'll be drawn to the light, but you won't be able to see without it. Thank you. So this thing actually works? It will. If the demon wants you, it will. Forgive me. We've lived too long as scavengers. I believe this is yours. Witch! Her child's the likeness of Alessa. Her child's the next vessel. Go! Go! Stop her! Don't let the witches go down! Come on! Get off her! Find her. No! Wait! Cybil! Cybil! Open the door! [METALLIC BANG] [CREAKING] [CLICKS] [GASPS] [SCREAMING] No! [GASPING] 8A. 7A. Right. Right. 6A. 4A. 3A. Left, left. Right, right. Left, left. [GASPS] [ALL MURMURING] [WHISPERS] Okay. I can do this. [GASPS] [GASPS] DARK ALESSA: Congratulations, Rose. You're here. You did it. Your reward is the truth. Did you see that Alessa was a good little girl? Even though nobody looked at her that way. KIDS [CHANTING]: Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Their parents told them she was bad. She didn't have a father like they did. [GRUNTS] Alessa was alone in the world. You know what can happen to little girls when they're left alone. [ALESSA SCREAMS] DAHLIA: It's okay, it's me, come on. Even her mother couldn't help. Even though she loved her baby. But the rest of the family didn't love Alessa. They were just like the others and made her scared. We know. Even the children know it. Your daughter... Why you won't just name the father... You've brought sin amongst us. The faithful must gather in judgment for we are called to purify this filth. What does she mean, Mommy? You're weak, my dear sister. You always were. Trust us, Dahlia. Have faith in our virtue. We will restore innocence. DARK ALESSA: They had met many times since the town was built to restore innocence and purity. They had a special place for that. Do you remember the hotel? I led you to all these places, and you were very good at following my clues. CHRISTABELLA: You may leave, Dahlia. We fight the sin, not the sinner. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! You know how that feels, don't you, Rose? To lose your little girl? What have I done? Oh, God. CHRISTABELLA: Weep not for the demon. ALESSA [SCREAMS]: No! Once again we are locked in mortal battle. They thought they knew how to cast out evil. Praise God for our clarity. ALL: Amen. Praise the innocent for their sacrifice. But you should be careful how you fight evil. CHRISTABELLA: Give us back our purity. ALL: Purity. [ALESSA SCREAMS] And our unity. ALL: Unity. Your weapons can turn back on you. [GASPS] Dahlia [WHISPERS]: No. No. Now you know why Dahlia is broken. [GRUNTS] She tried to get help, but she went too late. DAHLIA [SCREAMING]: No! GUCCI: Get her out, boys. Get her out now! There were good people in the town. People like you, Rose. People who like to help. Alessa was so lonely and hurt and scared. They should have known better than to hurt her so badly. [WHEEZING] When you're hurt and scared for so long, your fear and pain turn to hate, and the hate starts to change the world. Alessa's hate grew and grew, burning inside her. [ALESSA WHEEZING] Her hate got so strong, she even hurt someone who was only curious. That's when I came. I told her it was their turn. I promised. They would all fall into her darkest dream. [?] Now, Rose, we must talk. [NURSE WHIMPERING] [CRYING] DARK ALESSA: Don't be afraid. She won't hurt you. She needs your help. Who is she? She is Alessa. Then who are you? I have many names. Right now, I'm the dark part of Alessa. Where's my child? She's not your child. She's hers. The little girl is what's left of her goodness. We hid her in safety... in the world outside this hell. [?] [BABY CRYING] Now the dream of this life must end and so too must the dreamers within it. For over 30 years they've lied to their own souls. For 30 years they've denied their own fate. But now is the end of days, and I am the reaper. What do you want? All we ask for is satisfaction. Satisfaction? Revenge. Why me? You chose. You chose Sharon. Christabella will find Sharon. She plans to purify her. Oh, God, no. Their blind conviction repels me from their church. I cannot enter while they deny their fate, but you can. Just tell me what I need to do. Tell them the truth. [GRUNTING] [CRYING] [BANGING] [GASPS] DAHLIA: The girl is mine! Mine! She's mine! She's mine! The truth is clear to those who see. Just as I could see you hid this child. GUCCI: Let's go. Out of the car. Turn around. Just a friendly warning: I'll be back with people who know what they're doing. Before you do that, Chris, I wanna tell you about Officer Bennett. Few years back, some wacko, he abducted a kid. Threw him down a mine vent up there in Silent Hill. Cybil Bennett, she found that boy. She spent three days holdin' onto him, keepin' him alive until they were rescued. We know what we're doin'. I need to do everything I can. [ENGINE STARTS] Let's go. CROWD [CHANTING]: Burn her! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Please. Christabella, let her live. Your weakness led these souls to judgment. This time you will bear witness. She is innocent. Look at her. She's the whelp of your daughter. The demon! The demon fathered this disgusting abomination from her child! No, she's mine! CYBIL: Sharon! Sharon, look at me. Look at me. Don't be afraid. It's okay, it's okay. Your mama's coming. CHRISTABELLA: Once again we are called upon to restore innocence. We burn this witch, we vanquish evil! No. You can't, you can't. Don't let her say this! No! We burn the child! We fight the demon! [CROWD YELLING] She's just a child! What the fuck is wrong with you people? CYBIL: Let her go! Leave her alone! Leave her alone! Those who aid the demon, they must be cleansed by the fire from whence they came. That's crazy. You're crazy! CYBIL: No! Why are you listening to this? Why? CROWD [CHANTING]: Burn the witch! Burn her! Burn the witch. Burn her. Burn the witch. Sharon. MAN: Evil witch! Suffer. [CYBIL YELLS] CROWD [CHANTING]: Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn her! Burn the witch! Burn her! Burn the witch! [ALL CHEERING] MAN: Back, demon. CROWD [CHANTING]: Burn the witch! Burn her! MAN: Demon! Burn the witch! Burn her! Burn the witch! Burn her! Burn the witch! Burn her! [LAUGHING] MAN 2: Burn her! [CHANTING CONTINUES] You're in your own hell. [GASPS] Mama, be with me. [SCREAMS] [CHANTING STOPS] CHRISTABELLA: Here is where the apocalypse began. This is where we stop the annihilation of the world. We drew a line in the sand and said: "Demon, you will not cross!" But the demon is wicked, full of treachery. Yet again he comes to tempt us, in the guise of an innocent. To rid the world of this demon we must burn this child! [ALL CLAMORING] ROSE: That's not gonna happen! Mommy! It's okay, baby. Everything's gonna be okay. Oh, my God. MAN: Witch! Oh, my God. What have you people done? CHRISTABELLA: You have returned. Yes, I have. The witch has returned. CROWD: The witch, the witch. Do not believe her lies. I come from a world outside this place. I come from a world full of life! Why don't you tell them the truth? Tell them the truth that you deny even to yourself. There was no apocalypse! You burned in the fire that you started. And nothing can save you 'cause you're already damned! SHARON: Mommy! Take her! Burn her. Burn her as a witch. Burn her! Burn her! MAN 2: Demon witch! Burn me? Demon witch. That's your answer? Burn anything you're afraid of. Burn anything you can't control. This woman uses your fear to control you. She led you to burn Alessa Gillespie. She led you to burn an innocent child. But you will not deny your guilt and you cannot deny her pain! That child was sin incarnate. No. It's you who have sinned. You darkened the heart of an innocent. And now you cower in the face of Alessa's revenge. Heresy. Burn her. Burn her! [CROWD YELLING] Your faith brings death! You are alone in this limbo. And God is not here. SHARON: Mommy! [SHARON CRYING] She was a blasphemer. CROWD: Blasphemer. Blasphemer. Blasphemer! Blasphemer! Blasphemer! [?] [GROANING] [ALL MURMURING] [SHARON WHIMPERING] [CREAKING] [ALL CLAMORING] [GASPING] [METAL GRINDING] What have you done? You've brought the darkness in with you. Do you know what you've done? For Sharon. Mommy. Mommy. [?] [METAL GRINDING] [ALL SCREAMING] [WHIMPERING] [SCREAMING] SHARON: Mommy! [VICTIMS SCREAMING] Oh, Lord, give me the strength to stay pure. [GASPS] [SCREAMING] [FLESH TEARING] [SCREAMS] [GURGLING] [SCREAMS] No, no. [SCREAMING] Alessa, what have you become? [SCREAMS] [SHARON SCREAMS] Mommy! Sharon! Sharon, honey, it's me, it's mommy. [SCREAMING] Down! We're getting down. Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes, baby. Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes. It's just a bad dream. It's just a bad dream. [?] Why did she not take me with the others? ROSE: Because you're her mother. Mother is God in the eyes of a child. I love you. [ENGINE SPUTTERING] [ENGINE STARTS] [RINGS] CHRISTOPHER [ON MACHINE]: Hi, this is Chris. ROSE: And this is Rose. SHARON: And I'm Sharon Da Silva. ALL: Please leave a message! [BEEPS] Christopher, it's me. I'm with Sharon. [STATIC HISSES] Hello? Hello? Rose? Rose? And we're coming home. [BEEPS] [?] Thanks for watching.. [AKIRA YAMAOKA'S "YOU'RE NOT HERE" PLAYING] ?
