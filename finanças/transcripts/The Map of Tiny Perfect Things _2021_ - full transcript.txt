You're going to be looking at the rain hitting ground midnight tonight, moving in from the coast. - Morning, Mark. - Morning, Mark. - Loser. - Loser. Daiquir√≠. It's a village in Cuba. - It's got three I's in it. - Oh. - And toast. - Huh. Mark, can you, uh... - You know that's not real food, right? - I know. - Mark, eat something healthy. - To be fair, Dad, you're gonna be eating an entire pint of Chubby Hubby by yourself in approximately eight hours. You know you have math class today, right, Mark? What I know, Dad, is that the capital of Burkina Faso is Ouagadougou. Is that...? - O-U-A-G-A-D... - Hang on, hang on. - O-U... - O-U... - You are such a loser. - You are such a loser. - I am not. You... - I... You are. - I'm not. - I'm not. You'll be at Emma's soccer game, right? I'm sorry, but that is incorrect. - No, texter. Let it go. - Uh... Uh, the keys are in your bag. Bless you. It's, uh, straight down that way, and then it's kind of one of these things, and then it's your first right. - But wait. - I got kind of a Sherlock thing. - I love that show. - "The game is afoot!" "Game is afoot." Why would you say that? Let's take one more look at your winning numbers today: 42, 10, 25, 76... Oh, my God. I-I won. I just won! I won the lottery. Oh, my God! Yeah! Sorry. Are you okay? Thank you. You're the Sherlock guy. Did I give you directions earlier? ...like, the sun is 400 times bigger than the moon, but it's also 400 times farther away, so they look like they're the same size, - but they're not. - Mm. - Um... - And that is why we have eclipses. This is me. Well, would you want to hang out later? Tonight or something? Uh, I've got something. Oh. Uh, thank you. For your time. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, man. Hey. Dude, those guys have armor. - You got to use the rocket launcher. - Yeah. No way. - Shotgun. Watch. Ooh! - Here. - You're not John Wick. - Just a little bit of sniper rifle. - Your projectile's only gonna make it worse. - No, no, no! Not in the face. Not in the face. No, no. Not in the face. Not in the face. No, no... He got you in the face. Yeah, I know, Mark, he got me in the face. I'm never gonna find that key. What if your whole life was like that? What, where you die and respawn? Yeah. Or, like, you go to bed, and when you wake up, it's the same day all over again, just on repeat. What would you do? - Besides this? - Or in addition. You know? Switch it up a little. Wait, wasn't that a movie where Bill Murray's stuck in the same day till he has sex with his hot boss? Groundhog Day. Then that's it right there. Girls. You wouldn't... I don't know... Tie a bunch of balloons to a lawn chair or something? Dude, no. I'd definitely take the girl. - Okay, forget that. - No, no, no! - You could be a force for good. - Like Batman? - Yeah, like Batman. - But are we talking Dark Knight Batman or Ben Affleck Batman, because... Dude, The Animated Series, obviously. No, I'd still take the girl. I feel like it would ultimately be more satisfying. - Yeah! Hole in one! - All right. But it might be harder than you think. Dude, you'd get, like, infinite do-overs. You'd just iterate. Straight A-B testing. Right. If there's infinite do-overs, then sooner or later, it has to happen. Just, like, mathematically. Maybe it's like pi, though. Just goes on forever. There could be infinite ways for you not to get laid. Yes! Oh. -Oh, uh, next time... Then you'd never get out of the loop. Right, but why would you want to? You'd be the center of the universe. - You could do anything. - Yeah, but it could get - boring or lonely. - No way. Man, I mean, you would be, like, the king of everything. Hi, honey. - Sure, you will. - No. But say it's you and you tell me. - I'd just forget. - Right, but you'd never - believe me anyway. - We could've had this exact conversation, like, 50 times already. - Yeah. - The repetition. 'Cause it's not... No, I don't think I am being defensive. I'm looking at this as an opportunity. The isolation. You'd be like the last man on Earth. Three, two, one. What, where you die and respawn? Morning, Mark. - Loser. - Loser. Straight down that way, and then there's... there's, like, one of those, and you just take a right. - Uh, wait. - Psychic. Uh, I love psychics! So, what'd she look like? - She's kind of tall, got frizzy hair. - Ah! Sort of, like, a long nose. Not, like, a long, long nose, but like a... like a... So, not conventionally the prettiest girl ever. No, no, she's cute. She's cute. Oh, so you're into her. No. So you're not into her. Well, like, I'm not not into her. Dude, then why are you looking for her? Okay, fine, I'm completely in love with the girl from the pool. - What was she wearing? - She was wearing boots. Who wears boots to the pool? She's probably goth. She's probably at the Barnes &amp; Nobles at the mall reading a manga right now. Dude, this girl does not hang out at the mall. She's too good for the mall, huh? No, she's not too good for the mall. - I didn't... - Mm-hmm. Feelings for this one you have. Okay, is that Darth Vader or Yoda? 'Cause you have to pick one. You can't do both. Hey! Okay, does she have any tattoos? I'm not trying to I.D. her corpse. She did drop a flyer for a missing dog, though. Mark, okay. On the flyer, it'll have her phone number. Right. Yeah, and I called the number, and some guy picked up... Who does have a daughter, but she's eight. And he seemed really upset that I was using his personal misfortune to try and meet a girl. - Which is... - Which is fair. - Yeah, that's fair. - That's fair. But wait. So she's looking for the dog, but it's not her dog? You think maybe there's a reward? Did you try a dog shelter? Can I help you? Uh, y-yeah. I'm-I'm looking for a girl. We just have animals. - Yeah. - A vet? An alley behind a restaurant? I doubt she's looking for actual Tramp from Lady and the Tramp, but thank you. Maybe it's better this way, you know? Maybe you were gonna have this, like, doomed, toxic romance. Maybe you dodged a bullet. Hey, no, no. Hey! Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Come on. Great. Uh, h-hey. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, I'm Mark. Uh, I just had a quick question. - Okay. - I was wondering... This is gonna sound really strange... God, really bizarre... But are you experiencing any kind of temporal anomaly in your life? By "temporal anomaly," I mean... I know what temporal anomaly is. Okay, great. So, what specifically I was wondering is... The thing where the same day keeps happening? Whoa. Okay. Um... I-I thought nobody else knew. - Well, somebody does. Um... - Yeah. I-I saw you at the pool before. You caught a-a beach ball, and that had never happened before. So I-I figured that you probably had free will. I've actually been looking all over for you. - You have? - Y-Yeah. You dropped a flyer for a missing dog, and I found it, and the phone number on it wasn't you-yours. No, it wasn't. So, what have you been up to with, I mean, like, I guess, in-infinite time? Oh, you know, like, solving crimes and, like, finding true love. Really? No. Um, I've been teaching myself how to drive. Figure it doesn't matter if I crash because, you know, - time loop. - Time loop, yeah. - So... - I was gonna try and-and cure cancer. - Like that's what this was all for. - Oh, wow. And then when I figured it out, it would... time would start up again, and I would basically - have saved the entire world. - Oh. How's that going? Not that great. So far, not a lot of real progress. Maybe you set your sights, like, too high. Yeah. Like, maybe I should have just tried to cure athlete's foot. Pink eye. Indigestion. Well... - Mark. - Mark, this has been fun, but, um, I actually have to go. - You do? - Yeah. You know, 'cause, 'cause, uh I mean, you know that the same thing is just gonna happen again tomorrow, right? Yeah. Yeah, I do know that, yeah. Sorry. I mean, but it's like, you know, it's great being the only one who knows what's gonna come next, but it's also... weird. Like, everything that's happened has happened like a thousand times. Everyone's, like, sleepwalking, you know? They think this is all there is. Yeah. Like everyone else is dreaming and you're the only one who's awake. Exactly. I know you have to go, but-but you really need to see this. No, you have to hide. Here it comes. Sorry. - What? Where's my phone? - Sammy, the phone! Oh, no! Sammy, come back! - Dude, your dog... - Come on, Sammy! Your dog is taking my phone! I've watched that like ten times. - I think it's a metaphor for something. - Hmm. Come on. There's a better one. Run! So, he's explaining how feminists control the world and that's why no one will read his poetry, when... Quarters... drops them. Now the recovery. Oh, but it would appear his Linkin Park-style wallet chain got stuck under his bootheel and the consequences were nothing short of disastrous. I know it's wrong to laugh at other people's misfortune... But they are objectively hilarious. Um, I really have to go. C-Could I have your number? I'm sorry. I know that it's kind of like, um... But I just figured, since we're stuck in the same day for pretty much forever, it-it'd be good - to keep in touch. - Yeah, sure, yeah. No, not yet. No, I don't think I am being defensive. Eight, five, nine... one, seven... ...true love. Hi. I'm supposed to be in summer school. But I've only gone like twice. I want to... I want to go to art school, but my parents are obsessed with putting me in honors math. - You're in honors math, aren't you? - No. I'm in AP. Why do you think these things keep happening? I don't know. I honestly didn't figure it out until there was no new Doctor Who. Why? Why do you ask? I don't know. I'm just glad that Stephen Hawking isn't here to see this, because it totally violates all known science. So, what's the craziest thing you've done so far? - Crazy, like...? - I tried to hop a freight train once. How'd that turn out? I got way more respect for hobos now. I did, however, ride my bike through school. Wow. Impressive. Are you, like, five? Well, I guess the practical application is limited. Okay, but what if you were driving your Lamborghini into, like, a candy shop and the time loop ended and you were naked? See, that is exactly what I'm talking about. You must have done at least one cool thing. I put my chess app on maximum difficulty. - And? - I lost. There's got to be something else. Okay, I'll show you. Hey, watch it! You ever wish that today happened on a different day? Like Christmas or your birthday? I wish I'd painted my nails yesterday. Really? I like them. It's just nice. It's like a nice, um, chartreuse, right? - That's a green. - They're always chipped. I think that looks cool. Thank you. I just wish today wasn't the day my dad decides to have "the talk" about my future. Besides, who knows what they want to be when they're 17? - I do. - Really? Aerospace engineer. Specifically a NASA mission specialist. Wait. Like an astronaut? 'Cause that's cool. That's like a... I mean, it's just, like, a big call. I have 20/20 vision, uncorrected, so... You never know how shit your friend's taste in music is till you steal her car. Y-You stole this car? I need it more than Marissa does. And honestly, this song is kind of growing on me. Right? Bro, my lane! - Whoa. - Don't worry. I'm pretty sure if I kill us in a car accident that we come back to life. Yeah. God, there must be a lot of people who die today. You only just thought of that? 150,000. - What? - That's how many people die every day... 150,000. Geez. And you'd just go through it over and over again, like Sisyphus. Worse. He was just pushing a big rock. Dude, do you drive?! Sorry, that was depressing. Yeah. Probably a lot of people's birthday today, too. Yeah. Come on. Come on! We're gonna be late. Okay. I don't get it. Shh. I'm good, thanks. Look. How did you find that? I was looking for that dog. You know, the one on the flyer. I don't even know why. I just have all this... this time. I guess I just wanted to try and, like, fix something. Which I know doesn't even make sense. You can't find it anyway. I think I identify with that fish. Okay, Jared. I'm coming. So, I'll see you around? - 19 million. - What? That's how many people's birthday it is today. Bye, Mark. Hey, did you do that in your head? No, I don't think I am being defensive. I'm looking at this as an opportunity. Three, two... Crazy, like...? Mark, I hate to be judgmental, but why are we watching a bunch of skate rats? You'll see. It's like your thing with the eagle. It doesn't really seem that much like my thing with the eagle. Margaret, what is the one universal law of all skate rats everywhere? Um, that, ironically, even though skating completely identifies them, they suck at it, like, a lot. Exactly. You said 2:00. Yeah, I thought you were gonna be late. Any luck with the dog? - What do you got? - Oh! It might be time to give up on the dog. - Oh! You all right, man? - I lied before. I love being judgmental. - Here she comes. - Come on. Some kind of joke? Does your mom know you're here? There's no way you're landing this! Pretty cool, huh? Yeah. Just wanted to hear you say it. Whoa! So, who's Jared? He's a med student. How old is that guy? 21. Graduated Harvard at 19. Uh, I-I-look out! - So, I have a theory. - Yeah? You know how the fourth dimension's supposed to be time? - Yeah. - So, what if, like, these fourth-dimensional beings are sort of, like, toying with us? Like, they bent time in a circle and now we have to live the same day over and over again, - like on a hamster wheel. - Right. For their amusement. Except time's not the fourth dimension. - It's not? - No. Not in any meaningful Euclidean sense. Oh, yeah, well, of course it's not. Incoming. Incoming! That's what I think that this is all about. What, eating all the ice cream in the world and not getting fat? No, you showed me this when you showed me the eagle. I mean, think about it. Most of life is just junk, right? It's-it's filler. And then... there's these moments when all the randomness turns into something perfect. It's like life's dropping all the bullshit just for a second to show us how amazing it could be all the time if it wanted to. Hmm. I don't know. I think maybe we're supposed to become, like, better people. Though I honestly don't even know how that could be possible. I mean, think about it. We must miss so many of them. All those tiny perfect things, they're just... poof... gone. Lost forever. But not today. That is a disturbingly inspirational idea, Mark. But... mmm... I have to go. Why do I always feel like, even though we're stuck in the same day together, I am never gonna see you again? Because you watch too much Doctor Who. Wait. What if we found them all? - What do you mean? - All the perfect things in this one town, in this one day... We could collect them. Like Pok√©mon? Kind of like Pok√©mon. We'd be like partners. I mean, talk about seizing the day. The day's been seized. It's right here. It's waiting for us. Mark, you don't understand, okay? I'm not like you. I don't want to seize the day. I just don't want the day to seize me. Okay? I'm just trying to get through this. So am I. We're not that different, Margaret. We're not like other people. Everyone else gets a brand-new day every day, but not us... This is the only one we have. Sometimes I think, what if it's not enough? I just want it to mean something. Besides, you know, it's just us. Everyone else is asleep. You know what you said about the fourth dimension? The one that's not time? Yeah. It's still not time. But I've been thinking about what it really is, and... You know we have three dimensions, right? - Right? - Go on. Okay, so now think about your shadow. Okay, your shadow is two-dimensional. It's flat. So think about something that would cast a three-dimensional shadow... That's the fourth dimension. I mean, technically, we're just the shadows of four-dimensional people. - Whoa. - Yeah. Somebody actually figured out what a 4D cube would look like. I taught myself how to draw it. When I was little, I used to look for it everywhere. I mean, theoretically, it's around us all the time. We're just not looking in the right direction. You could see everything from in there. And you could see inside things, you could never get lost. It's like the whole world is a map of itself. But I never found it. I guess this is all there is. So you just gave up? Well, if the fourth dimension wants to stop hiding like a little bitch, it knows where to find me. So, how are we gonna do it? Do what? Find the perfect things or whatever. We need a methodology, right? Like a... like a system? Well, we want to be rigorous about it, so maybe, like, take a survey map of the town and, like, lay a grid over it and split it up into squares, each square is a 24-hour log, and then you could take half, and I... Or we could just walk around looking for cool stuff. - Like partners? - Like allies. Like the U.S. and Canada. - And I'll be... - I'm Canada. - No, you can't be Can... - Too slow. - I'm Canada. - Sir? - You did not. - Oh, yes. That was my thing. That's my thing. - Well, I took your thing. - I showed you that. I took it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm sorry. It's on! You know all that math you're supposed to be learning? Maybe. I'm gonna teach it to you. No. I can't keep hanging out with someone who's ignorant of basic logarithmic functions. Mark, Mark, look at yourself. You're a nerd who sucks at math. Where does that leave you? So, the first thing that you need to know about math is that it's always perfect. If I don't use this stuff later in life, my fat, bitter middle-aged self is gonna find you... Look. Wow. Can I tell you a secret? Of course. Sometimes I don't want this day to end. I just want time to stay broken forever. Have you ever seen Time Bandits? What is that? OMG, you've-you've never heard of Time Bandits? - Don't do that. - What? Don't say "OMG" like it's a thing people say. Okay, well, I mean, this is why time stopped... So that you can see the greatest - motion picture about time... - Mark, I have to go. Okay, blow him off, just this once. Okay? Jared will totally forgive you. - All right, just... - Mark, I just have to go, okay? He'll immediately forgive... You don't even... I-I got it. Return the map. Return what you have stolen. You're watching Time Bandits again? Yep, never gets old. You're getting better. Thanks. So, Mark, I know it's late... But I was hoping we could have a talk. About your future. I'm so glad you brought that up, because I've actually been considering joining the priesthood. - Uh-huh. Okay. - Or... the Space Force. Better yet, the Space Priests. Space Priests? Right. Is that... Do you have to go to seminary school - and aeronautics school for that? - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Right. Well, I wouldn't make any snap decisions. On that note... Oh, my God! So, who's Jared? Just a little bit of sniper rifle. So I met this girl. - Her name's Margaret... - Wait, wait, wait. You met a girl? Yeah. - When? - Couple days ago. Dude, I saw you last night. - You didn't tell me anything about a girl. - I know. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. You don't have to make it a big deal. - It is objectively big. - Okay, so, the point... - It's just, it's not adding up. - The-the point is that I never used to say this kind of stuff before, but I feel like we have a connection. I'm sorry. This is just a continuity nightmare. Every night, it's 6:00 p.m., we're hanging out, and boom... she disappears. Like a vampire. - Actually, that's more like a reverse vampire. - Okay. Which is basically just a regular human, I mean... - O-Okay. - Okay, then if she won't go on a date with you, then just spend a day with her. Did that. Okay, then take her on a stealth date. Just you two hanging out, no big deal, and then bit by bit, by imperceptible degrees, things get more and more romantic. And then bam! You kiss her. I don't think that's the sound effect that I would go for... - Okay, but you got to get the kiss, though. - I know. You just have to take her to a spot that shows that you really get her. I mean, you do get her, right? So, to be clear, this isn't - a perfect thing? - No, uh... I thought it could be fun to take a break. Hmm. I feel a little bait-and-switched here. Gonna be fun. You only live once. Oh, I see what you did there. You practiced that. Yeah, like a million times. Um, I don't have great associations with this gym, which will not be improved if some security guard comes in here and tases us. Oh, it's okay, I'll just tell him it was all my idea. This was your idea. What? BRUCE McCANDLESS II: Ah, we're getting a picture on the TV. You got a good picture, huh? McCANDLESS: Uh, there's a great deal of contrast in it, and, uh, currently it's upside down on our monitor, but we can make out a fair amount of detail. Here, we got to put these on. - Seriously? - Seriously. McCANDLESS: Okay, Neil, we can see you coming down the ladder now. What?! Okay, I just checked getting back up to that first step, Buzz. It's, uh... the strut isn't collapsed too far, but it's adequate to get back up. McCANDLESS: Roger. We copy. Takes a pretty good little jump. That's one small step for Margaret... No, don't ruin it. You know the real flag fell over? It got knocked down when they took off to go back to Earth. Maybe you could put it back up. Space food? What? Come in, come in, come in, Mark. Why did you do this? I-I just had some time to kill. No, you didn't. Not really. How did you do it? Well, I had a lot of practice, for one. And then I-I may or may not have bribed all of the kids in the art department. I just, I wanted to, um... Uh, you know... What? There's one more thing. What? We have to get back to Earth. - How? - With a space shuttle. Space shuttles are suborbital; they don't actually go to the moon. I promise, you will not regret this. No. - I already regret this. - I wasn't ready yet. - Okay. - Okay. Oh, no, no, no! Oh, my God! Ah! 15 seconds, guidance is internal. - 12, 11, ten, nine... - Ah! Ignition sequence start. Well, hang on! Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. All engines running. Liftoff! We have a liftoff, 32 minutes past the hour. Liftoff... And you wake up at exactly the same time every morning, except, you know, if you stayed up all night, - you'd mess it up. - Right. - You-you'd crash the system. - You'd think. - Except you can't! - Except you can't. Because something puts you to bed at midnight - every night, like... - Mm-hmm. It's like you get kidnapped by some cosmic nanny. It's so creepy. Is there anyone home? Uh, no. My sister's at violin practice, and my dad has old-person Pilates. You want a...? Why not? Are these your parents? Oh, uh, yeah. Yeah, my mom works late tonight, so I basically never see her, which is kind of the hardest part about the... this whole thing. My dad recently quit his job to write a not-that-interesting story about the Civil War. What about you? What? Your parents. Old people that look like you. Yeah. - What do you want to do? - It's evil! Don't touch it! So, at the end, why is Sean Connery cosplaying as a fireman? - It's part of the mystery. - Hmm. I have to pee. Because beer. You should probably do that in the bathroom. Yeah. It is completely... hopeless. Okay. Um, no. No, no, no. No. Uh... - What is this? - No. It's a work in progress. You made a map of everything. - The whole day. - All the perfect things. But you must have just done it, like, this morning. Well, I-I draw it pretty much every day. Wow. Boys are so weird. It's really good. Maybe you should go to art school. This is gonna sound stupid, but I, uh... sometimes I think if I stare at it long enough, I'll find something, like a... like a pattern. I never do. That does sound pretty stupid. Well, okay. And "tree house"... two words. You made a map of us. Too bad it's just gonna get erased. Yeah, it's too bad. I can't. - Oh, um, okay. Yeah, no. - I'm sorry. I should go. Yeah, Margaret, are you all right? Why shouldn't I be all right? I mean, is-is this about Jared? - No. - 'Cause he's not gonna call for, like, - another four minutes. - Oh, my God. - Can you just let that go? - I just feel like there's something that you're not telling me, and I-I just - want to let you know that you can. - Well, you're wrong. Okay? So too fucking bad. Look, Mark... We're castaways. Except instead of an island, we're marooned in a day. We're stuck here together. So I just think that we need to be careful to not mess it up. The "perfect things" thing... That was great. But maybe that's enough. I just think that maybe we should be friends. And have fun with it. I don't want to. Well, that's all I got. So take it or leave it. Yeah, I guess I'll take it. I'll call you tomorrow. Today. Tomorrow. You're going to be looking at the rain hitting ground midnight tonight, moving in from the coast. Not expecting to have too much in the way of wind, but... Morning, Mark. How's Mom? She's... fine. Good. Loser. It seemed like she was opening up. You know? Seemed happy. Not, like, happy-happy, but happy for Margaret. That's rough, bro. She sounds like an awesome person. Nah, I'm joking. I literally have no idea who you're talking about. Oh, no! Shotgun, shotgun. - What am I doing? - Not in the face. No! Those are imperial elites. They have four arms. It's like bringing a shotgun to a maser fight. Well, maybe it's better this way, you know? Maybe you were gonna have this doomed toxic romance. Hey, maybe you dodged a bullet. Feelings for this one you have. - Yep. - Mmm, I'm in love with this - mystery girl, in love... - Okay. Enough, enough. - Enough. - Of what, exactly? This is the problem. I thought maybe if I went around enough times, I'd get it right, but I guess not. You know what, maybe it is like pi. It's just wake up, rejection, repeat. Is that from Edge of Tomorrow? Yeah, it is. Nice. Mark? Mark, is that you? Oh, hey. I'm glad I caught you. Uh, I was just... I was just hoping we could talk about your future. Chubby Hubby? Here's the thing, Dad. I don't have a future. You know, I've heard that before from people your age, and it's pessimistic. And frankly, I think it's a little glib. Well, I'm a little tired of being the only one around here that knows what's going on. Look, I know about the climate. I'm... I am woke. - Do not do that "okay, boomer" thing with me. - No. That's not... that's not what I mean. Bottom line... art school is expensive, and when you graduate, what happens? I'm not gonna graduate, Dad. No one is graduating, because time is broken. Sorry, metaphorically? You have no idea what it's like to just have your future canceled for no reason. And don't lecture me about art school when you quit your job to write some midlife crisis vanity book. I don't think that's entirely fair, Mark. Why didn't you just dye your hair? Or, like, take a knife skills class? Or-or just buy a Tesla, Dad. Just buy a Tesla. Could you please stop for a sec? Just a second? Emma, Emma, could you please stop? - I-I am begging you, please. - Okay. Okay. Thank you. - So, did you talk to Dad? - What? He's been stalking you all day. I may have yelled at him. You yelled at Dad? I may or may not have told him to purchase a Tesla. Is that a euphemism? No. It's just, when he quit his job, I thought, "I get this. He's doing what he wants. He's following his passion." And then when I try and do it, suddenly I'm lazy and irresponsible. He didn't quit. You know Dad got fired, right? I don't think he messed up or anything. They just didn't need him anymore. And he doesn't want to admit that, because he's in such a shame spiral. And Mom's mad at him for losing his job, but she doesn't want to admit that because it'd just come across as too mean. They're just stuck right now. Stuck. I don't even think he minds you going to that art school so much. We just can't afford it now. How do you know all this? Psychic powers. Really? No. Because I think about other people besides myself. You should try it sometime. Hey, Em? How'd your game go? We lost, three to nothing. I'm sorry. Yeah. Keep working on that. - Uh, hi. - How can I help you? Um, I'm-I'm in your algebra class. I-I just had a quick question. I don't think I've ever seen you before. Yeah, yeah, I've been sick a lot. Like, really a lot. So, suppose, theoretically, that something happened to time. Like, the flow of time. Like, instead of going in a straight line, like, it-it just got stuck in a circle and-and kept repeating over and over. - Wasn't there a movie... - Yeah, yeah, yeah. What I wanted to figure out is what could cause that. I've been doing some research. Could the Earth have fallen into a wormhole? What? I-I mean, I don't think so. What if it got accelerated past the speed of light? No. Is reality just a simulation? That is unlikely but possible. - Ancient curse? - No. Cosmic nanny? I don't even know what that means. Is time just a big ball of wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff? Okay, that-that's a quote from Doctor Who. I really don't remember seeing you in my class. What if we're in hell? Like we did something bad and now we have to live this one day forever as punishment? This conversation is something how I imagine hell would be. Maybe your spiritual advisor would be - a more appropriate person... - What about a singularity? You know, those black hole things where physics gets all weird? Yeah, I know what a singularity is. And, I mean, sure, in theory, a singularity could produce a local temporal anomaly. So we would just have to get out of it. Like, get on a plane... and fly out of it. Why not? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go do the same thing I did yesterday and then forget about it. Perfect thing alert. False alarm. I'm starting to think maybe we found them all. Just had a theory that when we found the last one, that time would start up again. I guess not. To be honest, I'm kind of over the whole "perfect thing" thing. You realize it's never gonna be Christmas? Cool. You hate Christmas. Yeah, but I don't want to not have it. I just feel like screaming at everyone, "This isn't real. You're asleep. - Wake up." - What? Whoa. God, they're like zombies. You're a zombie. I'm serious, Margaret. It's time. Oh, no, no, no, no. Trust me, Jason, - that's more your thing. - Do I know you? - Why? - Why? It's like you said, we're stuck here. I didn't mean "stuck" stuck. Everybody else is stuck. We're free. Free from getting older, from going to school, - from climate change, cancer. - Okay, great. I get it. - Pink eye. Instagram. - What-what about all the stuff - that we don't get to do? - Like what? Like grow up or... I don't know... be an astronaut? - Mission specialist. - Whatever. What about all the things that I want to be? We're saying goodbye to the rest of our lives. We will never do anything that takes longer than 16 hours. I can get a lot done in 16 hours. Hello. You can't go in there! I feel like I'm living in an Etch A Sketch. Everything I do gets undone, everything I fix just gets broken, and everything that I make... - It just disappears. - Hey. We're thinking too small. Okay? We haven't even snuck into a zoo or ridden a Zamboni or ghost-ridden any cool new whips. Hey. - Public nudity... - Margaret. - ...is always an option. - Margaret, stop. It is. I'm just saying. - Oh, thank you. - Margaret, you're not listening. - What? - Margaret! Stop. This isn't working. Is this 'cause I won't kiss you? Why don't you just kiss one of them? 'Cause I don't want to. Y'all will forget about this tomorrow. - Margaret. - Come on. I have something to make you feel better. I've been saving it. Do people live here? Mm-mm. It's a show house. I guess they use it to make people, like, want to buy one of these. Mark. It's perfect. Okay. Ready? Oh! You know, even before this, I always thought there was something wrong with the world. Like, really broken. Not fixable. But nobody else saw it, so... I just walked around pretending everything was fine. And then what happened? Nothing. I still feel like that. But with you, I don't have to pretend. I was talking to my math teacher, and he said that we're probably just in a singularity and if we go far enough, like, on a plane... ...we could get out of it. Are you really in that much of a hurry? Like, "Hooray, it's the future." It's marriage counseling and global warming and colonoscopies and... student loans. And suddenly you're 80, and you're waiting for your Zoloft prescription at a Rite Aid in your sweatpants wondering, "Where is that creeping sense of failure coming from?" Because it all went by so fast. And you never wrote that book, you know? Or kissed that girl or... went to Paris. It's all over. And it wasn't even what you wanted. I mean, it's not gonna be perfect. It's the same stupid crap over and over again, just like in here. Yeah, but, I mean, you don't actually think that this is living, do you? We're stealing people's lives. My dad is-is never gonna finish his stupid Civil War novel. Henry's never gonna finish War Fight. And... My sister loses her soccer game three to nothing every day. We have all the time in the world. No, we don't. This is not time. Time is the stuff that when you spend it, you don't get it back. Okay. Um... "okay"? Okay, there's-there's a flight to Tokyo at 10:00 in the morning. Let's go. If this works, our parents are gonna freak out. Why Tokyo? I actually don't think it matters. Just so long as we cross the international date line, it's automatically tomorrow. Though there's a vending machine at the airport that sells puppies, so... I can't afford puppies. I spent like 30 years of my allowance on these tickets. You nervous? 'Cause I checked... This flight definitely does not crash. Don't jinx it. You know, if this works, we'll technically be saving the entire world. My sister said that I should think about other people more, so I feel like saving the entire planet is a pretty good start. You didn't cure cancer, though. No. You know, when I was a kid, I used to call these eye muffs. Although, if you think about it, an asteroid could hit the planet tomorrow. Like, maybe that's why time started looping. Because it's the last day before the apocalypse and really, instead of saving the world, we're actually just destroying it, which would... Margaret, are you okay? Flight attendants, prepare doors for departure and cross-check. Sir. Take your seat and fasten your seat belt. - I, uh... I... - Please take your seat, sir. Sir, please, sir, take your seat and fasten your seat belt. You're going to be looking at the rain hitting ground midnight tonight, moving in from the coast. We're not expecting to have too much... Morning, Mark. What? Thought you were gonna call me a loser. No. You were thinking it, though. Yeah. Hey, Dad, how's your book going? It's-it's great. I mean, the scope of the Civil War is just... you know, we can't even grasp it today. Do you know more Americans died at Spotsylvania than on Omaha Beach? I... do now. As I've mentioned, smallpox, tuberculosis, diphtheria... The casualties were unimaginable. And the thing is, the war could have ended so much earlier, especially if McClellan had just pressed through. After Antietam... Go, Emma! She's not gonna make it. - Go, go, go, go! - Go! Cover! Go! Goal! Go, Emma! I won! I won! And Mark again. - 72. - That is correct. Ah. What's got into you? On fire today. Isn't that a movie where, like, Bill Murray's stuck in the same day? - Groundhog Day. - Oh! - There he is. - Hey. Good luck. Oh! Go for it! You're gonna be okay, man. This stuff happens all the time. So, was that "Tony Hawk," like the bird? I'm just a phone call away. Mom. And just a... ...little bit of sniper rifle. - Oh, oh, you got him on the left? - I got him on the left. - Okay. - Okay, dude, listen. We're stuck in a time loop. You, me, everybody, same day's repeating over and over again. - What? - Like in Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow, except only me and this girl Margaret know about it, and we were sort of almost boyfriend and girlfriend, but not really, and then we broke up, and you won't remember any of this because your brain keeps getting erased. Wait, dude, you had a girlfriend? Not really. Well, what's she like? She's amazing. She told me this story about how, when she was a little kid, she was always looking for the fourth dimension. It sounds cheesy, but when I met her, it was kind of like I found it. There was just more to everything than I'd ever seen before. And there was more to me, too. And there always had been. I just never... realized it until Margaret showed it to me. Nah, bro, she sounds amazing. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Well, if you're all fourth-dimensional now, how come she dumped you? That's the thing... I thought everything was perfect, but there was more to the story than that. I thought it was a love story and I was the hero, but... wasn't about me. It wasn't my story at all. It was Margaret's. What are you thinking about? Just this boy. I messed that up. It's never too late. I mean, unless you're dying of cancer, but not until then. You know, even before this, I always thought there was something wrong with the world. Like, really broken. You know, not fixable. But nobody else could see it. So I just walked around pretending everything was fine. Are you Henry? I think I can help you. - So, you're a friend of Mark's? - Yes! Yep. That's funny, because he never mentioned you. Where did you two meet? Uh, temporal anomaly. Cool. Cool. So, if we're in a temporal anomaly, how many times have we had this conversation? First time. Right. Okay, so, and... what are you doing here? I'm saving your ass, obviously. And the dog? Oh, that's not my dog. His name's Chewbarka. There's these posters for him all over town. I think he jumped out of a van on the way to the vet, and I've been looking for him forever. And then suddenly, there he was, just like that. But it doesn't matter. Because tomorrow, he'll just be lost all over again. Mark was right... everything we fix just gets broken again. Okay, so, I don't understand what you're saying... Wait. Did you use the shotgun? Yeah, you need the grenade launcher attachment, though. - There's a grenade launcher? - Yeah. It launches grenades. Boom! I've died so many times doing that. Yeah, that's the thing. Death, it's so terrible. So terrible to lose someone. And if you don't face it, if you don't deal with it, then... ...you just end up losing yourself, too. Are we still talking about War Fight? Yeah. Yeah, you can take it from here. Oh, my God. It's the key. Whoa, it's the map. I was so lost before, but it all makes sense now. Oh, no. What? It's something... It's something Mark said. I think Mark might have been right about something. That doesn't sound like Mark. No. Sorry, I think I have to go. - I have to go check something. - Wait. - What? - Watch Chewbarka. I love you. What? Sometimes I feel like, if I stare at it long enough, something will happen, like, a-almost a pattern or something. There's something missing. And it's time. Time. No way. There's one missing. Seven... 7:00 at the pool. Pool. - You're up. - Mm. Are you okay? It's a relative term. I thought we'd have so much more time. I know. But you will be all right. I don't know. I don't know if I can do this. Listen to me, because I'm old and I know things. It's true that we're losing time every day, all the time, until one day it's all gone. But you're gaining it, too. Every second, perfect moments, one after the other, until, by the end, you have your whole life. You have everything. And it costs you everything. But it's worth it. I promise that it's worth it. You're still here. The plane thing didn't work. You were right about the map, though. There is a pattern. It's just not finished yet. There's one more perfect moment. Right. I will keep a lookout. I'm serious. I think that there's one more and that's the key, and once we find it, that's it. It's all over. Margaret, I... saw you go to the hospital. I'm... not gonna... try and take you away from her. I can't do that. Before this all happened, I went to go see her, and they told me that it was her time, that it was over. And that night, all I could think about was that tomorrow can't come yet; I'm not ready. I'm not ready to not have a mom. I just wanted time to stop. And it worked. Yeah. And I was so happy about it. I just wanted to stay in that moment, you know? And then the really weird thing was that you showed up, and I didn't know where you came from and why it was you, and... and, um, now I think I know why. I think it's because, you know, when it's time to go, I wouldn't have to go alone. Okay. And it's time. And it's not gonna be perfect. You know, we're never gonna find the fourth dimension or cure cancer or fix the world. The point is, is that I was wrong. We're the ones sleeping. Everyone else is awake, and it's just us dreaming. I know it's gonna hurt really bad... ...but I think that I have to wake up now. I think that this is the moment. Right now. And I don't want to miss it. That was kind of perfect. There was a hair in my mouth. Kiss me again? Goodbye, Mom. You ready? I don't know.
