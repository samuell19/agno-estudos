I remember how you were with Patch. He loved the outdoors. You both did. - Everything was easier then, wasn't it? - No. Just different. [LIGHTHOUSE BELL TOLLS] God has a map for us all. You... you can stray from the path easily. But finding the path again, that's the hardest thing. Look, if you've come to preach, then... Oh, no. No. [LIGHTHOUSE BELL TOLLS] You still haven't answered my question. How did you find me here? All sheep end up at market. It's a small world. I hadn't even heard of this place. It's a far way out west. What made you think I'd farm again somewhere else anyhow? You'll always pull back to what you know. You can't help but follow your blood. [LIGHTHOUSE BELL TOLLS] I just wanted the space is all. Well, now she's out of the way. You're here. - What? - You used to be so happy. Before her. Before her drinking and her other men. Don't bring her into it. Alright? [LIGHTHOUSE BELL TOLLS] Thank you. Just accept it. It'll make it easier for yourself. Why don't you ever listen, Mum? I know it was all too much for you. It's nothing to do with you. She was a selfish, ungodly whore. I hope it hurt her, Eric. The crash. I hope it wasn't quick. I hope she felt a slow, burning agony in the final moments. The agony she caused others. I hope the hot flames of the wreck were the last thing she felt before she was cast down into the fires of hell. Get out... Get out of my house. One thing you can be sure of. That baby. It wasn't yours. Likely the devil's child. Oh, it's a bastard. - You did the right thing, son. - Mum... You did the right thing. You did the right thing. - Mum! - [SHE SCREAMS DEMONICALLY] [HE GASPS] [HE BREATHES DEEPLY] Bax? Bax? [LIGHTHOUSE BELL TOLLS] [HOUSE CREAKS] Baxter? Back up there, lad, you're gonna get a hiding.

[FISHERWOMAN]: Is that what you think it is? [HE SNIFFLES] - You can't... you can't leave me here. - [LIGHTHOUSE BELL TOLLS] [FISHERWOMAN]: But maybe you need to be there. I don't need to be anywhere. [FISHERWOMAN]: We all need our place, son. Perhaps that's yours now. But I didn't do anything. [FISHERWOMAN]: What does that mean? It means I didn't do anything. [FISHERWOMAN]: What didn't you do, Mr Black? Nothing! [FISHERWOMAN]: No one does nothing. It was an accident. It was an accident. [FISHERWOMAN]: Your wife. [ERIC]: It was an accident.
