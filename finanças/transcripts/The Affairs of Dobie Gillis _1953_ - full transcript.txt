WHAT'S WRONG WITH "EVERYBODY WILL HAVE THEIR COPY"? WHY, NOTHING. I SAY IT ALL THE TIME. MY DEAR YOUNG LOUT, JUST BECAUSE YOU SAY IT DOES NOT MAKE IT CORRECT. YES, BUT EVERYBODY SAYS IT-- ALL MY FAMILY, MY FRIENDS-- EVERYBODY I KNOW. THE RULES OF ENGLISH USAGE ARE MADE BY SCHOLARS AND LEARNED MEN AND NOT BY COLLEGE FRESHMEN AND OTHER SUCH VULGARIANS. GEE, I DON'T KNOW, SIR. I THINK THE WAY THE PEOPLE USE A LANGUAGE IS THE RIGHT WAY, AND IF THE RULE SAYS NO, THEN THE RULE OUGHT TO BE CHANGED. IN THE 25 YEARS THAT I HAVE DEVOTED TO THIS UNDERPAID PROFESSION OF TEACHING, I HAVE HEARD MANY AN ASININE OUTBURST BUT NEVER ONE SO ASININE AS YOURS. I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT YOUR RECENT PASSAGE THROUGH PUBERTY HAS AFFECTED YOUR MIND, FOR YOU, SIR, ARE A PRESUMPTUOUS DRIVELER, A CRETINOUS BARBARIAN, A THICK-TONGUED OAF, AND AN ILL-BRED CHURL, AND IN THE FUTURE, YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO KEEP YOUR MINDLESS OPINIONS TO YOURSELF.

KIDS, HERE'S WHAT I CAN DO. I CAN PUT YOU TO WORK SELLING SUBSCRIPTIONS, NOT THAT YOU WOULD SELL ANY. NOBODY BUYS THE QUARTERLY. SELLING SUBSCRIPTIONS?

I SHOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU THAT SEVERAL WEEKS AGO, I ASKED YOU ALL TO WRITE AN ESSAY. I THINK THAT NOW ENOUGH TIME HAS ELAPSED FOR EVEN THE MOST DIM AND SLUGGISH OF YOU TO HAVE COMPLETED THE ASSIGNMENT. YOUR ESSAYS MUST BE ON MY DESK NO LATER THAN 5:00 THIS AFTERNOON. NO EXCUSES WILL BE ACCEPTED. [WHISPERING] What essay? How should I know? What essay? You got to write a 2,000-word essay. Did you hear that? A 2,000-word essay by 5:00. We'll do it. I can't even talk 2,000 words by 5:00. [CLEARS THROAT] IF YOU TWO WOULD BE KIND ENOUGH TO TAKE YOUR GRUBBY LITTLE HANDS OFF EACH OTHER, I SHOULD LIKE TO COMMENCE MY LECTURE. THANK YOU. TODAY WE SHALL TAKE UP THE PROPER USE OF "SHALL" AND "WILL." NICE TO SEE YOU AFTER ALL THESE WEEKS. IT'S NICE TO BE HERE. WHAT'S THE BOTTLE FOR? DURING YOUR LONG ABSENCE, EACH STUDENT WAS GIVEN AN UNKNOWN TO ANALYZE. HOW DO YOU ANALYZE AN UNKNOWN? I EXPLAINED THE PROCESS IN SOME DETAIL WHILE YOU WERE GONE. WHEN DO WE HAVE TO HAND IN OUR REPORTS? TOMORROW MORNING. IF YOU WERE THINKING OF COPYING SOMEONE ELSE'S REPORT, I THINK IT ONLY FAIR TO TELL YOU THAT EACH STUDENT HAS A DIFFERENT UNKNOWN. FIRST THE ESSAY. NOW THIS. LET'S BORROW SOMEBODY'S NOTES. YEAH. CHARLIE, CAN I HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR NOTES? HERE. TAKE MINE. THANKS. LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF. THIS'LL TAKE US ALL NIGHT. THAT'S IT.

WE'LL SNEAK IN JUST BEFORE CLOSING TIME AND HIDE IN THE CLOSET, AND THEN WHEN EVERYBODY GOES, WE'LL TIPTOE OUT AND PULL THE SHADES AND LIGHT OUR BURNERS AND DO THE EXPERIMENT. I'M WITH YOU, BUT FIRST OF ALL, WE'LL GO TO THE LIBRARY AND WRITE OUR ESSAYS. RIGHT. RIGHT. PANSY, COULD YOU LOVE A CHEAT? WHAT? IT'S NOW 4:30. I'LL NEVER GET AN ESSAY WRITTEN BY 5:00. I'M GOING TO COPY ONE FROM THIS BOOK. DOBIE, YOU'RE NOT. I KNOW IT'S A HORRIBLE THING, BUT IF I DON'T COPY THE ESSAY, I FLUNK THE COURSE, I GET KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL, I'M NOT WITH YOU ANYMORE, AND TO BE WITH YOU, I'D DO ANYTHING. OF COURSE, IF YOU PUT IT THAT WAY-- THEN IT'S ALL RIGHT? YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE THIS A HABIT, ARE YOU, DOBIE? NO, NO. AFTER THIS, I GO STRAIGHT. HERE THEY ARE, PROFESSOR. PSHAW. I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO FLUNKING YOU. WELL, PERHAPS THE ESSAYS WON'T BE ANY GOOD, AND I CAN FLUNK YOU ANYHOW, HUH? SHH. DOBIE, I'M SCARED. IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT AS SOON AS WE START WORKING.

MY DEAR YOUNG LADY, DO YOU REALIZE THE OVERHEAD IN A PLACE LIKE THIS? WHY, I HAVE TO-- MEN, I GOT IT! THIS IS HOW WE GET THE MONEY TO SEND DOBIE TO NEW YORK! Both: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WE GO INTO THE SECONDHAND BOOK BUSINESS. WHY SHOULD HAMMERSMITH MAKE ALL THE MONEY? LORNA BABY, YOU GOT BRAINS YOU AIN'T EVEN USED YET. IT'S A CINCH. HOW MANY KIDS USE PROFESSOR POMFRITT'S BOOK? 300, 400? RIGHT. WE BUY THE BOOKS, KEEP THEM TILL NEXT SEMESTER WHEN THE NEW CLASS COMES IN, THEN WE SELL THEM TO THE NEW CLASS AT A BIG, JUICY PROFIT! THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S WONDERFUL! JUST ONE PROBLEM. WHAT? WHERE DO WE GET THE MONEY TO BUY THE BOOKS? OH, YEAH. MAYBE WE COULD BORROW IT? WHAT KIND OF SECURITY HAVE WE GOT? YOUR CAR, DOBIE. YEAH...YOUR CAR. HEY, WAIT A MINUTE! Lorna: $900. Man: $600. 800. 625. 790. 635. 780. 650. HEY, LATVIAN, YOU'RE NOT SMILING. EXCUSE ME. I'LL MAKE IT 675, BUT THAT'S ALL I CAN LEND YOU ON THIS CAR.

COULD I SPEAK WITH YOU FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE? MR. GILLIS, YOU KNOW THAT I'VE IMMENSELY ADMIRED YOU EVER SINCE YOU HANDED IN THAT SPLENDID ESSAY. IT WAS NOTHING. OH, YES, IT WAS. I HOPE YOU'LL BE HANDING IN MORE LIKE IT. OH, I WILL. I KNOW JUST WHERE TO GET THEM. WELL, MR. GILLIS-- I FIND THIS A LITTLE EMBARRASSING TO TALK ABOUT. SPEAK UP, SIR. YOU NEEDN'T BE SHY WITH ME. OH, THANK YOU. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID, MR. GILLIS, ON THE FIRST DAY OF CLASS? THAT THE WAY PEOPLE USE THE LANGUAGE WAS THE RIGHT WAY? AS I REMEMBER, YOU DIDN'T THINK SO. I WAS WRONG. I BEG YOUR PARDON? HERE, MR. GILLIS, READ THIS. READ THAT ALOUD. "TO DOBIE GILLIS, THE MAN WHO OPENED MY EYES, I DEDICATE THIS EDITION." GEE, PROFESSOR! I'VE DONE A BRAND-NEW EDITION OF MY BOOK. ALL THE OBSOLETE RULES ARE GONE, AND I HOPE YOU WON'T MIND THE DEDICATION. MIND? WHY, IT'S A GREAT HONOR, SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, MR. GILLIS. LOOK HERE! WHAT'S THAT?

[ALL YELLING AT ONCE] NEW EDITION? NOW THEY WON'T BE USING THE OLD ONES! AND WE'RE STUCK WITH 300 COPIES! AND WE'RE OUT 700 BUCKS! MY FRIENDS, THE AX HAS FALLEN. THEY'VE GIVEN ME EXACTLY TWO WEEKS TO GET THIS MAGAZINE ON ITS FEET. OTHERWISE, WE'RE THROUGH. GEE, HARRY, WE'VE TRIED. NOBODY WANTS TO BUY THE MAGAZINE! THIS I KNOW, BUT WHY? AH, WHO NEEDS IT? WELL, I MEAN, EVERYTHING IS SO EXPENSIVE NOWADAYS. WELL, NOBODY'S GOT MONEY FOR THINGS THEY DON'T NEED. DO THEY NEED DANCES? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I MEAN, WHEN BENNY GOODMAN WAS HERE LAST YEAR, THEY HAD THE BIGGEST TURNOUT IN THEIR HISTORY. AND IF THEY HAVE A DOLLAR FOR BENNY GOODMAN, WHY HAVEN'T THEY GOT A DOLLAR FOR THIS MAGAZINE? THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT! WE'LL HOLD A DANCE! WHAT? DON'T YOU SEE? THAT'S HOW WE'LL SELL SUBSCRIPTIONS TO THE MAGAZINE. EASY NOW, PAL. LOOK, WE'LL HIRE A BIG-NAME BAND-- BENNY GOODMAN, TOMMY DORSEY-- SOMEONE LIKE THAT. AND INSTEAD OF CHARGING A DOLLAR FOR A TICKET LIKE THEY ALWAYS DO, WE'LL CHARGE TWO. AHA! AND THE EXTRA DOLLAR WILL BE FOR A SUBSCRIPTION TO THE MAGAZINE. RIGHT! A PACKAGE DEAL! THERE'S A SMASHING IDEA! NOT BAD, NOT BAD. NOT BAD AT ALL! THERE'S ONLY ONE THING WRONG. WHAT'S THAT? WE HAVE EXACTLY $1,000 IN THE MAGAZINE'S TREASURY, AND THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO PAY OUR DEBTS. HOW COULD IT BE ENOUGH TO HIRE A BIG-NAME BAND? WELL, WE CAN TRY. ALL RIGHT. I'LL WRITE A LETTER TO A BOOKING OFFICE IN NEW YORK AND SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY. NO, NO, NO. DON'T SEND A LETTER. THEY'LL TURN YOU DOWN. WHAT YOU NEED IS SOMEONE TO GO TO NEW YORK IN PERSON-- SOME YOUNG, CLEAN-CUT, APPEALING, CHARMING, PERSUASIVE FELLOW. ME, FOR INSTANCE. I DON'T LIKE TO BRAG, BUT YOU'D HAVE TO GO A LONG WAY TO FIND SOMEONE AS YOUNG, CLEAN-CUT, APPEALING, CHARMING, PERSUASIVE AS ME. HE'S RIGHT. WHY, HE CAN CHARM A BIRD OFF A BUSH. THAT'S A FACT. I'VE SEEN HIM MAKE STRONG MEN WEEP. GREAT LITTLE TALKER, OUR DOBIE. THE GREATEST. IT'S ALL TRUE WHAT THEY SAY. WELL... ALL RIGHT. YOU'VE MADE A WISE DECISION. GOOD BOY. I'LL GET THE MONEY. GOOD LAD! THAT'S USING THE OLD NOGGIN. GEE, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D GET TO SEE PANSY AGAIN. I WANT TO THANK YOU KIDS AN AWFUL LOT. AW, FORGET IT, KID. WE KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE IN LOVE. HUH, CHARLIE? HERE IT IS. YOUR EXPENSES HAVE TO COME OUT OF THAT $1,000, SO DON'T WASTE A PENNY! YES, SIR. DON'T EAT TOO MUCH. YES, SIR. AND STAY AT THE "Y." YES, SIR. GOOD-BYE, DOBIE. SO LONG. HAVE FUN. AND TRAVEL BY BUS! Dobie: YES, SIR! HELLO. MAY I SPEAK TO MISS PANSY HAMMER? WHO IS THIS? THIS IS MR. JOHNSON, THE DEAN AT MISS HAMMER'S COLLEGE. YOU SOUND VERY YOUNG TO BE A DEAN. YES, DON'T I?

PANSY! HI! IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU! PANSY DEAR, HOW ARE YOU? FINE. LOOK--A CORSAGE. OH, THEY'RE LOVELY, BUT ISN'T IT A LITTLE BIG? I'LL FIX THAT. OH! PANSY, IT'S BEEN AWFUL WITHOUT YOU. SAME HERE. THERE'S NO CHANCE YOUR FATHER WILL CHANGE HIS MIND? UH-UH, NO CHANCE. OH, WELL, ENOUGH OF THIS GLOOM. AT LEAST WE HAVE TONIGHT! COME, LET US TASTE ALL THE JOYS THIS GREAT CITY HAS TO OFFER US! HI HO! VIVE L'AMOUR! [ORCHESTRAL SOUNDTRACK MUSIC PLAYING] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... $600? Man: THE CONTRACTS? YEAH, I THINK I GOT THEM IN A FILE HERE SOMEPLACE.

LOOK, KID, COME ON ALREADY. HOW MUCH LOOT? $600. GOOD-BYE, KID. HARRY JAMES WILL DO. KID, YOU'RE NOT WELL. PERHAPS YOU COULD SUGGEST SOMEONE. NOBODY'S GOING TO GO WAY OUT THERE FOR $600. AHEM! AHEM!
