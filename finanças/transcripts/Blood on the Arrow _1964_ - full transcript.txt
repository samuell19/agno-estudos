[light dramatic music] - [Narrator] In 1871, the Gila Bend Mountains of Arizona became the last stronghold of the Apache Coyotero Indians. Led by their chief, Kai-La, they broke out of their reservation where they had been confined after Geronimo's escape to Mexico. Despite the presence of the United States Army at Fort Welter, they staged savage hit and run raids. Their arrows and tomahawks left a trail of death across the entire territory. [dramatic music] [light music] - Lieutenant, I don't know much about the jails in Arizona. They got big locks on 'em there? - Yeah, big enough if you're thinking about breaking out. - Oh, just thinking about tomorrow. A man's always gotta think about tomorrow. [horses trotting] [light dramatic music] [dramatic music] - Group to the right! [Coyotero hollering] [dramatic music] [Coyotero hollering] This is where we'll take cover. [Coyotero hollering] [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [Coyotero hollering] [horses neighing] [Coyotero hollering] [gunshots banging] - About these handcuffs, you're gonna need every gun you can get. - I can't trust your gun, Cooper, get behind those rocks. [light dramatic music] [gunshot banging] - If you don't shoot straighter than that, I'm never gonna see a jail. - I'm not taking those handcuffs off. [gunshot banging] Do the best you can. [Coyotero hollering] [dramatic music] [gunshot banging] [man groaning] [dramatic music] [gunshots banging] [Coyotero hollering] [man screaming] [Coyotero hollering] [gunshot banging] [man groaning] [gunshots banging] - Get down, you idiot. [gunshot banging] Let him be. [Coyotero hollering] [suspenseful music] [Coyotero hollering] [Coyotero cheering] [dramatic music] [Coyotero cheering] - You have done well. There will be six more guns for our braves. [Coyotero hollering] [light dramatic music] [dramatic music] [light dramatic music] [somber music] [light dramatic music] [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [light dramatic music] [branch crunching] [light dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [body thudding] [light music] [water splashing] [dramatic music] [light music] - Oh. [Wade coughing] The arrow. - Coyotero. [dramatic music] [light music] - You'll have to ride. [Nancy groaning] Try to get up. Please try. [dramatic music] [light dramatic music] [shovel clanking] - All right, drag it out, Tim. - [Tim] Sure, Pa. [light dramatic music] [water trickling] - What are you waiting for? - It's awful hot. - Ah, a little sweat never hurt anybody. - Yes, sir. - Come on. - [Nancy] Clint. [dramatic music] - Are you crazy bringing somebody here? - He's hurt. - It's Cooper, Wade Cooper. I've seen posters on him is Bisbee. - Well, I didn't know, Clint. I found him at the stream. He said it was the Coyoteros. - Coyoteros? Where did it happen, Cooper? I've gotta know! - In heaven's name, Clint, get the arrow out of him. - If the Coyotero is loose, I'm not hanging around up here. Come on, get him over to the wagon. [Wade groaning] - Gee, Wade Cooper, and he ain't even wearing a gun. - There's one in his belt, son. - Well, you took your time telling us about it. - [Nancy] He could have used it before if he wanted to, on me. Of course, that wouldn't occur to you. - You were in the stream, you said. Why should he wanna shoot a naked woman? - Did you have to say that in front of Timmy? - Maybe I'm not afraid to tell him the truth. Come on, let's get outta here. [light dramatic music] [wagon creaking] [horses trotting] [light music] - Pa, is he gonna be all right? - Better than he should be. - Pa, what if the rest of his gang's around? [light music] - That's enough, we don't owe him anything. Cooper, I wanna know something. Where did you catch that arrow? - Over near the Hassayampa. - Clint, if they're that close. [horses trotting] Oh, Timmy, get down. [horses trotting] - Just a minute. [dramatic music] That's a patrol. You won't need that gun. Put it down. [intense dramatic music] Those blue bellies don't know I'm in here. You'll keep it that way. - Company, hold. [light dramatic music] You folks don't have too much time. We're warning everybody in this area to clear out and get to Fort Welterman. - What is it, the Coyoteros? - How did you know about the Indians? - A settler just road through. He said he heard about it. - The Coyoteros broke out of the reservation. Now, they're holed up in those mountains. And until reinforcements get here, we don't have enough men to go in there after them. We've seen what they can do to anybody they get their hands on. Now, take my advice. Go to the Fort. Forward ho! [horses trotting] - 10 years I grew up and starve on that filthy mountain. Just when I hit it rich, I have to leave. - Your life is more important now. - That mountain is 10 years of my life. Well, they'll need food and water. - Pa, Pa, come quick! - Let him be. Get some things together. - Well, we can't just leave him here like this. - I got $20,000 in gold on that wagon. Wade Cooper is not going to ride with us. - Timmy, hurry, go to the corral and get your father's horse. - Yes'm. - Some day Timmy will understand what a conscious is. I'd like for him to think you had one. - Don't be a fool, Nan. He's a killer. You heard him threaten us. - [Nancy] You have no right to judge him. You have no right to judge anybody. - You didn't feel that way about me before we were married. - You wanted me, Clint. - You were a woman then. I'm leaving him. When we get to the fort, I'm going to tell the army he's here. - You're either more afraid of a gun than your husband or you think faster. You convinced that Captain that it was a settler that told you about the Coyoteros. - Your gun is very important to you, isn't it? - It's settled a few differences. - It wasn't loaded. I emptied it more than an hour ago. - Does your husband know that? - [Nancy] No. - Why didn't you turn me in? - What would I be trying to prove, I'm better than you are? When you go wrong, you're the one who has to live with it. That can be hell enough. [door thudding] - Would you get ready? [dramatic music] [Coyotero hollering] - No, don't! [intense dramatic music] [Coyotero hollering] - Get the guns. [light dramatic music] Kill them. - Wait! Wait! You want guns, we have only a few here. - Stop. Let him speak. - I can get you many guns. Enough for every brave in your tribe. - Why would a white man help the Coyotero? - I'm willing to trade our lives for guns. - He is trying to trick us. Kill him, Kai-La. - You haven't a chance fighting the white soldiers without guns. Why the army'll hunt you down on the mountains and destroy all the Coyoteros. Your tribe will be wiped out. - The white soldiers will never find the Coyotero in the mountains. - When 10 suns have come into the sky, you will have the guns. - Can we believe the white man? He lies to save his life. - Take him. If he lies, the boy will die. - No! [light dramatic music] No, no! - There's no need to take the boy. - You have 10 days. [Coyotero hollering] [horses trotting] - Nan. [Nancy crying] - Oh, they'll kill him. - I couldn't know they'd grab the boy. - Oh, Clint, what are we gonna do? You can't get those guns, you know you can't. - I had to say something. They'da killed us. [light dramatic music] [Nancy crying] Cooper, don't get any big ideas. Keep your hand off of those. - Really hit it big. Should be a regular glory hole. How much gold you expect's in all those bags? - Clint! Is that all the two of you can think about now? What are you gonna do about Tim? - What's it worth to you, Mrs. Mailer, if I get you those guns? - Oh, anything. Oh, anything at all. You know that. - It's your turn, Mr. Mailer. - 10,000 in gold when delivered. - And now I'll tell you how I see it. I figure I owe you something, ma'am. So, the guns aren't gonna cost you anything. But your husband, I don't owe him a thing. So, it's gonna cost him $20,000 in gold. - 20,000? - Oh, give it to him. I would have expected Wade Cooper to drive a harder bargain. - You'd better talk. That Chief gave you 10 days to get the guns. How long will it take you to get to Nogales? - I wasn't figuring on traveling anywhere. - What is it you want? - What men I have left are all in Nogales. Now, I know where the guns are, but I can't get 'em by myself. - Now, look, Cooper. If you're expecting that 20,000-- - Oh, please, Clint. You know we can't travel. Getting to Nogales and back will take four or five days. He'll go, Mr. Cooper. - All right. I'll give you a note to a man named Jud Willis. That'll be all you need. - You realize I'll be leaving him alone with all that gold? - You'll also be leaving me here with your wife. That'd bother some men more. - I'll expect her to remember she is my wife. [light dramatic music] - Clint. He was right. Leaving me alone with a man like Wade Cooper would bother some men more. - That mine's gonna make you the wife of a rich husband. Cooper isn't worth losing that to you. - Clint, why do you always stop me from loving you? I can't go on just being grateful. - When things are over here, we'll move back east. Get a big house, Clint Mailer will be something. You'll look at things differently then. [light dramatic music] Maybe you'll even learn to be a wife again. [light dramatic music] [crickets chirping] [boots thudding] [dog barking] [light music] [horse snorting] - Where are you going? - The horses need watering. I'll be down at the stream. - I can do that. - The way the patrols have been going through here, you'd better stay outta sight. [light dramatic music] [light music] [floorboard thudding] [gentle music] [plates clanking] - Between your doctoring and your cooking, I believe those Coyoteros wasted an arrow. - Feeling that much better? - I'm feeling real good lately. Now, I noticed you didn't ask me many questions. - Anything in particular I should know? - The law would say you were harboring a criminal. Those troopers were bringing me in because I grabbed an army payroll. - All I know is you're the man who's gonna get my son back. Oh, I found this in your shirt before I washed it this morning. [crickets chirping] [light dramatic music] - The Indians want the guns. They're not gonna bother your boy. - It's lonely without him. That photograph, is she waiting up on some mountain too? - No. She's dead. - Oh, I'm sorry. - We'd only been married about a year when the war broke out. I was on the losing side, so was she. She was killed. When Sherman's army came through, they burned everything. She was trapped inside the house, couldn't get out. Wasn't even enough left of her to bury. - The war has been over a long time. - Not for everybody it hasn't. - She must have been a fine woman to have a man lover her like that. [light dramatic music] Goodnight. [dramatic music] [light dramatic music] [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [Nancy groaning] [Nancy screaming] [horses trotting] [dramatic music] [knee thudding] [man groaning] [water splashing] [fist thudding] [water splashing] [dramatic music] [fist thudding] [water splashing] [fist thudding] [suspenseful music] - I saw him come down over the mountain and head this way. - Your face. - Now, you go on back to the house, and you get up. - [Nancy] What are you gonna do with him? - He's gonna take me to his camp. - The Coyoteros? - There's only one language an Indian understands. [dramatic music] [horse trotting] [light music] [birds chirping] [light dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [light dramatic music] - The white man thinks little of his life. - We made a deal. You said that if you got the guns, our people wouldn't be harmed. - I keep my word. - But your brave don't. This one tried to attack the mother of the boy. - He lies, Kai-La. - Only the truth would make him brave enough to come here. The woman mean more to you than your own people? If you had harmed her, we would not get the guns. We would be trapped in this hills till the soldiers come. [dramatic music] You are no longer our brother. You are no longer Coyotero. Leave us. If I see you here again, I will have you killed. From now on, you live and die by your own hands. You are alone. [light dramatic music] - I don't see the boy. - He has not been harmed. [light dramatic music] [light music] - Did you come to get me out, Mr. Cooper? - Not just yet, Timmy. - Is Pa gonna get the guns? - I'm sure he is. He made a deal with Kai-La, didn't he? - Yes, sir. I, I ain't never been away Ma and Pa much before. - Oh, yeah. They treatin' you all right, boy? - All right for Injuns, I guess. I think I'm scared. - Anybody would be. But you'll be home before you know it. - Don't take too long, Mr. Cooper. - Yeah. [light dramatic music] - Tomorrow will be the fifth sun. You have not many days left. [horse trotting] [light dramatic music] - Oh, Wade, did they let you see Tim? - I talked to him. - Then he's all right? - They're not gonna do anything to him. They can't afford to. - Ah, he seems so far away. [light dramatic music] - He's gonna be all right. Quit worrying. [light dramatic music] - It's a terrible thing loving anyone so much. Your whole life grows around them. - Yeah, I know. - You won't let yourself love that way again, will you, Wade? - I haven't wanted that responsibility since my wife died. [somber music] - Did it help to become what you are? - Perhaps. - She wouldn't have wanted that. No woman would. [light dramatic music] - We're fooling ourselves. You saved my life and I saved yours. Makes us even. - And you don't want anything else to be important but Clint's gold. - It's the way it has to be. Clint, he's getting off cheap. I'm leaving him you. [horse trotting] - Oh, it's Clint. He's alone. - Did you get to Nogales? - Your men are out there. They wanted me to make sure the law wasn't around. - Yeah, well that'd be Jud's thinking. He wants to live to be an old man, I think. - They told me to tell you to show yourself. - There's no need to check on your gold. If it was gone, I would be too. [crickets chirping] - Well, you might at least tell me you're glad I'm back. - I am, Clint. You know that. [Wade whistling] - Mike, Jud. [crickets chirping] Men. - My friend, you've got more lives than the proverbial cat. - And you need a bath, Jud. - When the master calls, I come. Even when a bath seems preferable. - How'd you get away from them blue bellies? - It's a long story. Charlie, put those horses in the barn. Keep 'em outta sight. - Sure, boss. - Wait. I thought you might be looking a little naked. This'll keep you warm. - You think of everything, don't you, Jud? - Always. - Come on in. - Well, now, this must be the lady of the house. - Nan, the boys are hungry. - All right, Wade. - Isn't every woman jumps when you say so, Wade. - This is strictly business. Don't you forget it, any of you. - She ain't yours, Wade. Or are you saying she is? - Are you talking about my wife? - Charming woman, Mr. Mailer. - Yeah, mister, we like what we see. - Mike! - Mike, boy. I admit to a certain curiosity as to whose gun is faster, yours or Wade's, but since Wade is the key to a small fortune for us, I'd hate to find out now the quickest gun was yours. - He could shoot your eyes out before you could blink 'em. Now you stay away from him. - I ain't no gunslinger, but he was saying something about you and Nan. - And what do you wanna hear? That you can't trust her? - I want all of you outta here as quick as you can get. - Put that down and leave us alone. [door slamming] - Now that's what I'd call a civilized married couple. Each has their own room. - Must get mighty cold around here in the winter. [men chuckling] - Now, you listen to me. When you finished eating, go to the barn. We'll talk there. And that's as close as I wanna see any of you get to this house after that. [horse snorting] - That woman's made a fool out of you, Wade. First, you show us all that gold under the floor in that house, then you tell us we have to steal guns from the army to give to the Indians before we can even touch it. - That sounds plum crazy to me. What's to stop us from grabbing that gold now and getting out? - You wouldn't want Wade to break his promise to the little lady now, would you? - You're the fool, Jud. [clanking] Two things that are stopping us. First, you don't care about, that's the Mailer boy. - You're right, we don't care. - Second, 20,000 in gold. Split up five ways, how far do you think that's gonna get any one of us. - If we're not talking about 20,000, what are we talking about? - More gold than any of us will ever see the rest of our lives. - That could depend on how long a man lived. - I suppose all that gold's just laying around waiting for us to put in our pockets? - Mailer's mine's a glory hole and I know where it is. And the Coyoteros want only to get out of those hills. So, we get 'em the guns. Once they're out, we can work that mine in peace, milk it to the bone. Should the law get too close to us, we load up all the gold that we can carry. Enough to make us all rich. Duck down across the border into Mexico. - I'll bet that's one promise Wade didn't make the little lady. - Yes, sir, if I had some liquor, I'd sure drink to that. - It's not gonna be as easy as you make it sound. - Anytime you don't like following my orders, you can get out. Now, it's a two day ride to Apache Bend, so I suggest you get some rest, all of you. [crickets chirping] - Mike, just how fast is your gun hand at this time of night? - As fast as it has to be. Why? - In the morning, Wade'll be pushing us into his deal. I don't like it. - What's not to like about a gold mine? - The army and the Indians stand between us and that gold mine. Would you say that our chances were very good? All that stands between us and all the gold in that house is the Mailers and Wade. - You want me to gun 'em? - Well, as a man who's gambled all his life, I'd say the odds were better that way. - Kill Wade? I don't know, Jud. I don't know. - Charlie, you're exerting your brain again. You think better with your muscles. We could take that money and be on our way to Nogales between daybreak. - Wade had no right making us stay in the barn. [pistol clicks] I'm willing to say that he's no better than we are. - Tex? - Working the mines sounds like honest work to me. But then, I don't think I'd be no good at it. - Charlie? - Wade never did me no harm, but I ain't no good alone. - Yeah, that's what I like. Nice, honest election. - But that door's locked. How are we gonna do it? - Well, we just walk up to the door and knock, and when somebody comes, Mike'll be waiting. [dramatic music] - Clint, Clint! Get up. Now do as I say. - What is it? [light dramatic music] [knocking] [dramatic music] - [Mike] Cooper ain't here. - We're taking that gold and Wade isn't stopping us. - Mike. [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [gunshots banging] [dramatic music] - They were gonna take the gold. Cooper killed him. - How did you know? - I always wondered what you'd do if you ever thought you had everything your way. - You still want those guns, you need us Wade. I'll do it your way. Isn't that enough? - Bury him. - Oh, just bury him. You find killing that easy? - You think they'd have let us live? - I'm sorry. It's just that, I once said your gun was important to you. I didn't know it would be important to me. Thank you, Wade. - You'd better be ready to ride in the morning. [light dramatic music] [crickets chirping] [door thudding] - You haven't said a word in hours. - It's a sweater for Tim. I want it finished when he gets back. - Tim, always Tim. - Oh, Clint. - Maybe you had more to say to Cooper. - You're still asking if anything went on between us? - I think I have a right to know. - All right. He kissed me because I wanted him to. - Because you wanted him to? Aren't you afraid to tell me that? [slapping] - I don't know why I did it, Clint. Maybe it was just an escape for me. Nothing else happened. He wouldn't let it. - I waited a long time for you to unlock that door for me. Or maybe you only want Cooper to have the key. [door slamming] [dramatic music] [crickets chirping] [light dramatic music] [horses trotting] - All right. [man groaning] About ready? - All set. - Get a bull. Go get your horse. [wagon clanking] [light dramatic music] [suspenseful music] Keep your mouth shut. Get over against the wall. [pistol butt thudding] [fist thudding] [dramatic music] Sit down. Don't try to be a hero. Nobody's gonna get hurt. [light dramatic music] Pick up your horses, move out. - Ya! [Tex shouting] [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] - He saw us. They'll have every trooper in Arizona lookin' to hunt us down. We'll all hang. - Get outta here. [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] - No, hey, hey! - All right, get the wagon over the road, fast. Charlie, Jud, help get that wheel back on. [dramatic music] Ya! [light dramatic music] - Troop halt. - They cut off the road. [dramatic music] They're in there some where. - Foragers. Troop forward with a walk. - [Man] Walk. [light dramatic music] [wagon creaking] - Charlie, get your back underneath that wagon. [Charlie groaning] - They'll be on top of us in a few minutes. Let's get out of here. - Not without those guns. - What do I care about guns? A man gets to be my age, he looks forward to dying natural. - Ow, my back. My back's caving in. Get that wheel on! [wheel thudding] - There. Hope she sticks. - They're closing in fast. - We'd be a lot better off if we ditched these guns. - I'll worry about the guns. Now, we're gonna make a run for it. Tex, get up there and get 'em outta here. [light dramatic music] - Ya! - Go on. - At a charge, ho! [dramatic music] [horses trotting] [suspenseful music] - [Wade] Charlie, pick up my horse. [dramatic music] [gunshots banging] [explosion booming] - Whoa! Cut around, alert the fort. - All right, they're gonna be watching the main roads, so we'll find us a back trail. Let's go. [wagon creaking] [crickets chirping] - We can only guess Cooper intends selling those guns to Indians. He and his gang are somewhere in this area. So are the Coyoteros. I don't think it's a coincidence. - You told us you were getting more men. Even if the Indians have the guns, what good will it do them? - Those reinforcements aren't here yet, Mrs. Mailer. And the way things stand, those Coyoteros could slaughter my entire garrison and murder every sucker who gets between them and the Mexican border. - The army's supposed to keep the peace here in the valley. You shoulda had more men to handle the Indians. - There's something bothering me, Mr. Mailer. Why have the Coyoteros left you alone? - Your patrols have been going through here looking for Wade Cooper. That must have kept them away. - That's possible. By tomorrow, I may not have a patrol left. You'll be on your own. It's hard to understand how even a man like Wade Cooper can turn against his own people. Troop forward. [horses trotting] - All right, get in the barn. Stay there and keep outta sight. - He thinks we're mixed up in it. Well, does that bother you? - We are mixed up in it, Clint. You and Tim and I. We're to blame, not Wade. - Are you out of your mind, defending Cooper? - I don't know. Would you believe me if I told you Wade isn't doing this for the money? - Either the gold bought 'em or you did. Which is it? - Does it make a difference? - If you lied to me about you and him, so help-- - You shouldn't leave your door open. Somebody might hear something you don't want 'em to hear. [door slamming] For your information, Mr. Mailer, that nothing can buy me but money. - Did you get the guns? - I got 'em. We're taking 'em over the Coyoteros tomorrow. - The army was here looking for you. - I know. - Now, look, the 20,000 is behind that counter. Take it and you and your cutthroats get outta here. - Don't you even wanna know where the guns are? They're in your gold mine. - You took your men to my mine? - They'll be safe there. Nobody ever found that spot but you. The boys were quite impressed. Richest vein they ever saw. - You get your men outta there. $20,000 is what you get and no more! - I figure the job's worth a lot more. - Wade, you gave your word. - And you believed him. Cooper, you're not gonna get my mine. That Captain isn't very far away. I'll tell 'em you forced us into this. He'll know how to deal with you. - [Nancy] Clint! [barrel crashing] [fists thudding] [groaning] [fists thudding] What are you gonna do with him? - I've had to deal with a lot of rats in my day, Mailer, but never one who'd sell his own son out. - Tim's not my son. Hear me Cooper? He's not my son. [dramatic music] [Nancy gasping] - Leave me alone, go back! Just go. Oh, don't stop me, Wade. Don't stop me, please. - Are you trying to run away from the truth? - No, not now. Let me go, Wade. I can't let it happen. You heard what the Captain said. There aren't gonna be enough troops to stop the Coyoteros. - It's too late to change that now. - Well, I can try. I'm not gonna let Tim grow up knowing his life had cost a lot of others. If I can get away from the Indians, we won't have to give them the guns. - [Wade] You were going up to the Coyotero camp? - If I failed, it would be better if they killed us both. - Tell me something and it's important. What did Clint mean about the boy? - [Nancy] It doesn't concern you. - Tell me. - All right. You said you had a year of love in your marriage. I had nothing. Tim's father died the the day before we were to be married. [somber music] - You let Tim believe that Clint's his father, is that it? - That's one lie I wouldn't want him to live with from now on. Now you've heard what you wanted. Let me go. - You're not going up there. Now, listen to me. We both dug our own graves before we were dead. It doesn't have to be that way now. - Well, nothing's changed. - We have to be the ones to change it. Getting Tim isn't all there is to it. The guns are still there, the Coyoteros could find 'em. - You said, we're the ones who have to change things. What did you mean by that? - I wanna be the one to go after Tim. Now, if I can get him, then I'll destroy the guns, blow them up. - You'd do that? But your men want the mine. If you spoil it for them, they'll kill you. - They were willing to kill me for $20,000 before. They're gonna have to settle for that now. - Oh. - We're gonna need horses. But you'll have to be careful. My men are still in the barn. After you get them, meet me at the river. Wait there. - All right, Wade. [dog barking] [light dramatic music] [dramatic music] [horse snorting] [gate creaking] [suspenseful music] [horse neighing] [Tex gasping] - What, what, what? [suspenseful music] - Kinda late for a ride, isn't it Mrs. Mailer? Where were you going? I said, where were you going? [Nancy gasping] Take her in the house. [light dramatic music] Hey, Wade! Where's Cooper? - [Clint] Get these ropes off me. - [Jud] I said, where's Cooper? - [Clint] I don't know where he is. - [Tex] No, well maybe your wife does. She was trying to take a couple of horses. - You were going away with Cooper? - I wouldn't have stayed here with you Clint. Even if I had never met Wade. - You mean Wade was gonna go off and leave all that gold just for us? - Where is he? - I'm not gonna tell you. - Maybe you would rather tell me? - I can't. - All right, Mrs. Mailer. If Wade Cooper wants you, he'll have to come back here to get you. And when he does, we'll be waiting. [light dramatic music] [dramatic music] [light dramatic music] [dog barking] [suspenseful music] [light music] [suspenseful music] - Timmy. - Yeah? - Are you sure this'll get us to the mine. - Yeah, I know the way, Mr. Cooper. - Well, I sure hope so. Sun's gonna be coming up soon. Let's go. [dramatic music] [light dramatic music] [dramatic music] - Let it go. Let it go! [suspenseful music] You drove me from my people.

The explosion you heard, he destroyed the guns. - You're crazy, he wanted that gold as much as we did. - I'm telling you the truth. - You'd let him do it, knowing the Coyoteros would kill Tim? - The explosion meant he has Tim with him. Now, I'm warning you, get out of here before it's too late. - She's right, Jud. In a little while, this place'll be crawling with redskins. - There's still the 20,000. - You're leaving that gold.
