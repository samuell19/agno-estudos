Hi, Auntie! I'm sorry I haven't gotten around to seeing you. It's okay. I hope the souvenirs are still all right. -I got you chocolate too. -Really? You didn't have to, Auntie. What's this? I didn't know what to get you. But the moment I saw that, it reminded me of you. Because it's yellow, right? Thank you so much, Auntie. You really didn't have to. It's no trouble at all. You're not busy, are you? Let's grab some coffee. Sure. You must be tired. The jet lag is getting to me. Maybe I'm getting old. Did you stay with Uncle Bas in the Netherlands? Yes, I did. Just the two of you? Well, with Sandra there, that made it the three of us. Isn't it kind of awkward, Auntie? Why would it be awkward? Well, you and Uncle Bas are divorced. Do your clients know that your own marriage… failed? I've never kept it a secret. We just chose the path that made everyone happy. Including our daughter. I don't see it as a failure. I think I could use your counseling too, Auntie. Are you getting married? No. Then what for? I want to talk about… the marriage of the man that I love. -Mr. Gilang? -Yes? Are you sure we need three electrical plugs? Did we settle on three or two? That's the thing, sir. I think it's three. Or was it two? Maybe it was three. Just get two. And the electric installation? Put three in, but with two plugs. -All right. -Okay. -All good here? -Yes, sir. That's good. It looks neat. -That's great. -Sir? It's your mother-in-law, sir. I'm sorry, Gilang. I've been trying to call Ambar, but she didn't pick up. You didn't pick up my calls either. So, I called your office. They told me you were on site. So, I asked them for a number I could call. Can you come over? The staghorn fern fell off. Yes, the one you and Ambar gave me. Well, you already said yes, right? I'm leaving now. I'm picking up the kids, and then I'm off to the workshop. Ambar. Mrs. Nin called for a meeting after class. -Mrs. Nin is here? -Yes. Bagas. Ayu. You're not playing with clay today. Please, just for a while, Mom? What did you promise me? Go on, do your homework. Fine. Who else is coming? Mrs. Nin, Harry, me, Abi, and you. She wanted to discuss a new event. Good afternoon. Good afternoon! Oh, you got your own apron. Yeah, I got it online yesterday. -From the store that I told you about? -Yeah. It's a cute color, right? Okay, let's start. I think you need to pull on that part a bit. -Just a little. -Pull it higher? -That's great. -How did you do that? Why can't I do that? Not yet. -Mom? -Yes? -This one is hard. -Which one? I'm still on the first question. Can you do this one? -Yes. -What's the answer? -Twenty. -Ayu? -Mom is teaching, Ayu. -Go ask Bagas. -I'll help you. -Take care of your sister, Bagas. Auntie, what's your name? You've forgotten already? We just met recently. Huh? It's Yuli. Oh, right, Auntie Yuli. I'M AT YOUR MOTHER'S. SHE WANTS TO SEE THE KIDS. CAN YOU BRING THEM OVER? Ayu? What are you doing? I told her not to bother Auntie Yuli, but she wouldn't listen. I like her hair. I want her to do my hair like that too. The braids? Yeah, that's what I mean. All done. Thank you, Yuli. No problem. Are you going to clean up? Is there anything I can do to help? Where do you live? Kebayoran. It's not that far from here. Why do you ask? I heard someone say that staghorn ferns are supposed to bring luck. It fell off, so what does that mean? Is something bad going to happen to me? Of course not, Mom. It just wasn't tied up properly. Gosh. -Gilang, yesterday… -All set. Right, thank you. Rian called me yesterday. How is he? Well, you know Ambar's brother. He always says everything is okay even though he's struggling. Gilang… I want to send Rian some money. At least for his kids. My grandchildren. Rian is like a brother to you too, right? But please, don't tell Ambar about this, okay? -Mom… -Grandma! Grandma! My gorgeous girl. -Good afternoon, Auntie. -Afternoon. -Afternoon. -Grandma, look at my hair. It looks beautiful, sweetie. -Who did it? -Auntie Yuli. -Oh, thank you. -You're welcome. This is Auntie Yuli, Mom's student. -Right, where is Ambar? -She's in a meeting. A meeting? Yes, Ambar is in a meeting. She might be running late. That's why she asked me to drive the kids here. It's on my way home. -You really shouldn't have. -It's okay. Your garden looks so green, it's beautiful. Yes, all thanks to Gilang, Ambar's husband. I see. I have a surprise for you two. -What is it? -It's inside. -I'll see you around. -Okay. -Bye, Auntie! -Bye! Excuse me. Ambar told me to give you a message. She said that Bagas has to shower at four and that his medication is in his bag. All right, thank you. I should get going. Wait, is that…? Is that a red bristle philodendron? -Is it not? -Yes, it is. You like plants too? I've been looking at decorative plants. My boyfriend wants to redo the outdoor area of his restaurant. I'm helping him do that, and I ended up liking plants. -Need a gardener? -Sorry? I design gardens for a living. -Yeah. -I see. So you're like a landscape architect? I mean, I'd love to, but… I'm not sure if it's within our budget. I'd be glad to help. Here's my card. You can call the number right there. "Gilang Priambodo." Yeah, he's Ambar's husband. The lady who teaches my pottery class. Have you ever heard of him? I've heard of Agung Priambodo. He's a senior architect. But Gilang Priambodo… Never heard of him. Do you think it's his son? So what do you think? Should we give it a shot? Yuli, my head hurts. I told you. I'm leaving it all to you. That means you're responsible for making all the decisions. Okay. Got it. The last time I was here was five months ago. It still looks the same. Aren't you going to finish it? Don't ask me. You're being weird too. You once dated a straightforward guy, and you said he was too aggressive. And now, you're seeing a more passive guy, and you don't like him? I mean, he could just show a little interest in me, you know? Don't be so proper all the time. It confuses me. I shouldn't have asked for your opinion. It's useless. And what about you? What about me? It's been a month since the huge fight. Any progress? He keeps avoiding me whenever I try to talk to him. So there's that. -Maybe you should start the conversation. -I always do. Anyway, in my opinion, what you need to talk about is not the fight, but the cause of the fight. -Now you're a smart-ass. -I mean it. You sound like a marriage counselor. Oh, right. I almost forgot. Glad you brought it up. So… I've been meaning to send you the number of this marriage counselor. I'll send it now. They say she's the best in Jakarta. Well, there aren't a lot of options anyway. You know her? No, my friend told me about her. Is she good? Hmm, let's see. My friend and his wife are all over each other now. -Shut up. -I'm serious! They almost split up, Ambar. His wife cheated on him. Isn't it too much? What do you mean? Me. If we go to a marriage counselor? I mean, it's not like he cheated on me. -So you're gonna wait until he does? -Oh, God, no. Sorry, I mean, of course it's not too much. I'm just saying. It's up to you if you want to meet her. You can go to a counselor, a psychiatrist, a priest, a mayor… You can go see the president for all I care. It's up to you. If you don't want to, then don't. In the end, it's your decision to make, Ambar. Those marriage counselors probably live perfect lives, right? Even doctors get sick, you know. Hi, sweetie. Go to your room, wash your feet, and brush your teeth, okay? How did it go at my mom's? I have to put the kids to bed. -Hey, Gilang. -Hi, Dina. You sure you're both still fighting? You guys look fine to me. Should I just consult with you? Sure, I was going to send you an invoice anyway. MAMA MARISA: GILANG, CAN YOU DO IT? I PROMISE THIS IS THE LAST TIME. Night, honey. -Why haven't you showered? -It's Bagas, Mom. Let me see. -It's fine, I put the cream on myself. -Did you really? -It's okay now. -No, let me see. Ayu! Bagas. Your father didn't put the cream on you yesterday, did he? I forgot to tell him that it was in my bag. It's okay, Mom. Your father forgot. I did. I really forgot. Here, let me put it on you. Pull up your shirt. "Forgot." Ugh, that's scary. What are you doing? Decorating what can be decorated. I can't just let it sit here forever. Why are you so angry? It's been a year and Bagas still hasn't gotten any better. I told you, I forgot. You didn't even apologize. All right, I'm sorry. Not to me. Apologize to Bagas. If you thought this was important, you never would've forgotten it. I've made an appointment for us to see a marriage counselor. Just because I forgot to apply Bagas' cream? We need someone who can make us want to talk about our problems. I'm willing to talk. We don't need to go to a counselor. All right, so let's do it. -Do what? -What do you mean, "Do what"? We've been skirting around the topic of my mother for over a month. Let's talk about it now. Now? I have to go to work. I really have to go now. Yesterday, your mom asked for some money to send to Rian. I told her I couldn't help this time. Isn't that what you want? I'm going. Actually, I asked Ambar to come along with me today. But she said she had to take Ayu to soccer practice. Oh, right. Okay. Are you… Are you close with Ambar? Not really. Not yet. -Okay. -Sorry, just a second. Oh, good, it's Kemal. All right. Seriously, Yuli? Can't you pick up on the first ring? I'm really busy. Pick up right away next time. I'm sorry. My phone was in my bag. What's wrong? I can't come to the meeting. Something came up. Oh, all right then. Gilang? Sorry, Kemal can't make it today. Is it okay if it's just me? Of course, it's not a problem. Okay, great. Where do we start? I'll just show you the layout of the café so you can get an idea. Here it is. So did you major in architecture or…? -Design? -Architecture. And you ended up dealing with gardens? I've always liked plants. I like working outdoors. Whenever I see the greenery, it's like a breath of fresh air. I feel free. It beats looking at the same four walls all the time. Yeah, I understand. Kemal was actually worried it might be too expensive. But after my meeting with Gilang yesterday, it turns out the budget is okay, and the schedule works out too. That's great. Are you sure it's okay? What do you mean? Nothing. I just don't want to overstep. Why would you? It's fine. It's business. Besides, Gilang loves it whenever he gets more work to do. Are you leaving? Yes. I have to go. -Are you sure it's fine if I leave? -Sure, I can clean up on my own. -Bye. -Take care. Mom. Bagas, Ayu, your Granny is here. Bagas! Come here. Let me see your back. Oh, dear. Why is it getting worse? My poor grandson. Didn't you put the cream on him, Ambar? Of course I did. Your mother is too lazy to apply the cream, huh? Where's your dad? He's in the shower. I see. -Let's eat. -Bagas… How are you two getting along? Fine. And your mother? She's fine as well. I think. Let's eat. I'm worried about Gilang. Back when he was still working with his late father, it seemed like he was doing well. But now that he has a lot to support, I don't think starting his own business was a good idea. It's satay! Bagas? You actually have it easy. You don't have to worry about mortgages. Mom? -Bagas, turn the volume down, will you? -Hey, Gilang. -Mom. -I'm glad I called. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have known that Bagas' eczema was getting worse. You barely even call me anymore. -Bagas? -Just a second, Mom. Come and eat, or else there'll be no TV for you tomorrow. That's enough. You shouldn't be threatening your children. If he doesn't listen to you despite you speaking nicely, then something is wrong with how you're bringing them up. You should talk to your wife. Mom. I'm very grateful for everything you have done for us. But with all due respect, these are my children. -I will bring them up my way. -Ambar. I should go. Thank you for the satay, Mom. Say hi to your mom for me. I'm sorry, Mom. Let's eat. Aren't you going to eat Granny's satay? I will. Here you go. She doesn't want to. Don't force her, Ayu. It's all right. I'll eat it. Thank you, Ayu. I sent you the address of the marriage counselor. We're meeting her tomorrow at 11. I'll meet you there. I'll drop off Bagas and Ayu first. Don't be late. Why did you make decisions without talking to me? You take too long to answer. Mrs. Ambarwati and Mr. Gilang Priambodo? Yes. -Thank you. -You're welcome. MASTERS IN PSYCHOLOGY, MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPY All right, Ambar and Gilang. What brings you here? Who wants to talk first? Well… I feel that we're having problems communicating in our relationship. And what about you, Gilang? Do you think there is something wrong with the way you communicate? Last month we had a huge fight. Since then, our relationship has gotten worse. Was there something different about this fight compared to the others? It was our biggest fight. According to each of you, how bad has it been lately? Um, we… Ambar gets angry more easily. That's because you always avoid talking whenever we have a problem. I don't want to make things worse. Has that been going on for the past month? -Yes. -No. It's been going on for years. Before we continue, can we rewind just a little bit? Can you tell me the reason behind the big fight? There's nothing to tell. It was all my fault. It wasn't Ambar's fault. It wasn't anybody else's fault. Gilang, I see that you feel guilty. What makes you feel that you're guilty? I'm sorry. -Sorry about this. -It's okay. How long are you going to keep running away from our problems? I can't do this. I'd rather talk about our problems with each other, not with a stranger. Oh, is that why you'd rather talk to your mother about all of our problems, about my mother? Listen, Ambar. If I had told you… about how your mother constantly asks me for money, would we really have had any other choice than to help? Gilang. We can really explore this further. This is just a rough idea, but I think, it would be great to put a reflecting pool that can make use of the surrounding trees. -What time does the place close? -At 10:00 p.m. We can install some lighting too. Just a couple of LEDs over here, right there, and there. That way, even at night, we can still see the reflection of the trees in the water. Let me just measure one more thing. It's great. I love the idea. Thanks. Wait until you see the 3D image of it, Kemal. It'll look great. I'll have my driver take you back to your office. No, it's fine. The traffic is crazy at this hour. I'll just take the train as usual. How can you like taking the train? It's so crowded and dirty. Are you sure you don't want my driver to take you home? Yeah, it's all good. Why don't you have your driver take Yuli back home? Oh, Yuli is used to taking the train. I'll just tell my driver to stay here then. So when can I get the pictures? Soon. All right, I'll be waiting to hear from you. Yeah. -Let's just sit over there. -Okay. How long have you been dating Kemal? About five years. But I've known him since high school. -Why? -Nothing. It's just how Kemal is. He just seems a bit arrogant, but he's actually nice. -How do you like the pottery classes? -They're fun. I don't know, but for me… It's calming. The teachers are great. Ambar is fun too. When Ambar first took up pottery, she said the same thing. Really? Fun and calming. -Just like what you said. -Is that so? Why did you start taking pottery classes? Well, I got fired from my job four months ago. I tried applying for several jobs. None of them called back. I got so stressed. But then, at the same time, Kemal said he needed someone to help with the renovations. So I used my severance pay to take different lessons. I tried learning how to make sushi. -Oh? -I tried yoga too. Oh, and I even tried currency trading. No, I wasn't good at it. That last one was a complete bust. I have no talent for trading. And then, just a month ago, I was scrolling through Instagram, and I found Ambar's account. I applied. And I loved it. Since then, I feel like my life has changed. It's funny. A short amount of time can change so many things. But sometimes the longest time can't change even the smallest of things. After that, we started getting closer, Auntie. I don't know why, but I felt… I felt comfortable around him. Auntie Yuli! Please braid my hair! So, how is it going? The project with Gilang. Oh, Kemal is thrilled with Gilang's ideas. He sent the design yesterday. It's beautiful. I think we're starting to work on it this week. I'm glad to hear that. But it must be nice to be you. Having a husband like Gilang. I bet the garden at your house is beautiful, right? All lush and green. Come, come here! I have to go now, Yuli. You're leaving? Yeah. Bagas, Ayu! Thank you, Auntie. Don't bite the rope. What is it, Mom? Your dad is on his way home. -He brought food. -Food? Did you tell him? Bagas got punished at school today, Auntie. -Stop it. -Ayu. -He didn't do his homework. -Ayu, stop it! -Sorry about this. -It's okay. -See you around. -Okay. -Bye, Auntie! -Bye-bye! -Bye. -Take care. If you have trouble with homework, you can ask me or Mom. I can't believe you skipped your homework three times. Your mother had to go to school for this. Bagas, take it easy, okay? The doctor said if you're stressed, the itching will get worse. Come here. Hey, I want a hug too! Hey, you. Come here! -What are you doing? -Who cares? That's enough. That's enough! Let's eat, before it gets cold. -Come on, Dad! -Let's go. After my brother got married, he moved to Germany with his wife. Two years ago, they got divorced. Rian now has to take care of his two kids. He doesn't know anyone there. He doesn't even have a stable job. And he's too ashamed to come back to Indonesia. That's why my mom secretly asked for money from Gilang. My mom would never tell me. She knows that if she does, I will say no. And to make things worse, Gilang chose to tell his mother about it. And several times, he even borrowed his mother's money for this. When we were visiting my in-laws, Gilang's mother accidentally let it slip. And when we got home, I asked Gilang. I kept asking him. Eventually, he admitted it. And I was furious. What made you so angry? I'm aware that he's just trying to help my family. But I'm disappointed. Why didn't he just tell me everything in the first place? He never tells me anything and he never involves me in anything. Not even when it comes to problems with my own family. I feel… I feel like a fool. He acts as if everything is okay. But he's actually carrying the burden of my family. But what breaks my heart the most is, we've been married for ten years, but I have never felt like I am treated like his wife. Is it wrong for me to want to be involved in his life? In every problem he faces? We can face whatever problems we have together. Have you ever told him about these worries? There are a lot of our problems that are left unsolved because he chooses to bottle things up or walk away from a conversation. Then… how do you feel when he chooses to be silent? Or when he just leaves the conversation? Exhausted. I hate being the one who constantly demands things in this relationship. I ended up hating myself. When the big fight happened, were the children there? Bagas. Bagas, it's your turn. So, Bagas heard you fighting? What am I supposed to do? I don't want… Bagas, go on. I don't want my children to suffer. Do I just keep quiet? Staying silent is just as dangerous as screaming at each other, Ambar. Besides, nothing good ever comes out of repressing your anger or disappointment. Do you still love your husband? Bagas, come on. The one outside is automatic. Just turn on the tap. Mom? I heard you're working on a project at Auntie Rima's house. So I came over. I mean, you wouldn't have got this project if it weren't for me. I got you something to eat. Why didn't you call first? I could have come over to your house later. When have you ever picked up my calls lately? Why did you come here? Ambar's mother. Is she still asking you to do things for her? Gilang, I'm serious. I regret telling you everything. I didn't tell you about Ambar's mother so you can take it out on Ambar. Are you mad at me? I just wanted to protect you. Protect me from who? Anyone who wants to take advantage of you. Including your mother-in-law. Mom. I'm not a little boy anymore who needs protection. I will deal with it myself. From now on, I want to fix my marital problems on my own. Hi, Rima! Yes, I'm at your house now. Checking up on my son at work. All right, all right. I got it. Should I come inside? Okay. WE'RE STILL ON FOR TOMORROW, RIGHT? What's his name? Do I really have to tell you his name? Not really. His name is Giraffe. Gosh. And? When did you realize you had fallen in love with Mr. Giraffe? Gilang. Hey. I was just saying, it's okay if you want to cancel today's meeting. Seriously, I can call Kemal right now. No, sorry. It's okay. I was just distracted. You have a lot on your mind, huh? What's your favorite animal? -What? -Your favorite animal. -Giraffes. -Giraffes? -I don't know. -Wait, what? -I asked you a question. -It's a random answer! I don't have a favorite animal. Why? -This is so random. -Yeah? If a giraffe drinks tea, then how long will it take for the tea to reach its stomach? I don't know. Come on, let's try and count from the moment the tea enters its mouth. One, two, three… -Why are we doing this? -To get your mind off of things! -Refresh your mind. -Okay. -A distraction. -Sorry I'm late. -Kemal, come here. -Traffic's bad around here. Don't your clients hate coming all the way here? Do you want to drink something? Later. About what we discussed over text… Can we move up the timeline a bit? That's the thing. -I was just telling Yuli about it. -Listen. My father is coming to Indonesia next month. He wants to see the restaurant. Why didn't you tell me? Can you do it? Kemal, I think we need to talk about this. Yuli, can you please stop interrupting me when I'm talking to Gilang? Besides, you were supposed to take care of this. I'll move up the timeline. Really? -If you need extra… -I don't. No need. You sure? -Where's the restroom? -Out the back. I'll be right back. A minute and a half. What's that? Well… I think it'll take a minute and a half for the tea to reach a giraffe's stomach. -That's what this is? -I was counting. Seriously? Hey, if these bags are open, you need to tie them up again so the cement won't get wet, okay? Or use these, come on. Put that one at the edge. The plant, at the edge. Right at the corner. -Hey. -Oh. -Have some coffee. -Thanks. -Is this normal? -What? Working, even in this weather. Well, you know how tight the deadline is. I'm sorry. Why are you sorry? It's fine. It's not even raining that hard. It's just a light drizzle. Just a light drizzle, but it'd be pretty bad if it happened every day. If it happened every day, Bogor would be the City of Drizzle. It does sound more romantic. Is it okay? Yeah, it's perfect. The bittersweet. The moment. And the person. One, two, three, four, five. There are five people here. Perfect. That's so corny. I got it from you. Come on. Very funny. You're regretting these jokes, right? -Kind of. -What I meant was… -It's sweet. Very refreshing. -Okay. Where did it rain? Bogor. I went to Yuli's boyfriend's café. I saw Ms. Kartika again today. Why didn't you ask me to go? Would you have gone if I'd asked you? You still want to do it, right? Well, you decide if you still want to do it. All right. So how did it go? About my mother and your mother. Actually, when you told me that you had informed your mother, about my mom, and about… I'll admit, I was being ridiculous the other day. I promise. From now on, I will distance myself from your mom, and I won't tell my mom anything else. Do you really think that avoiding both our mothers will solve all of our problems? Gilang. I think the root of our problem is more fundamental. Is that what Ms. Kartika told you today? Do you even think of me as your wife? Why are you doing this again, Ambar? You just love putting me in a tough spot. I said I was sorry. Do you know what our problem is? Are you sleeping on the sofa again? All right, what is our problem? -There's a lot! -Okay, like what? Besides, do you really want to fix all our problems tonight? Is that even possible? Getting a marriage counselor doesn't do anything either. -You're not taking this seriously. -You didn't even ask me to come. If I'd asked you to come, would you still walk away like this? See. You're always assuming. You already have this image of me. Aren't you doing exactly the same thing? Caught up in your own thoughts. "Ambar doesn't want me to see her mom." "Ambar would do this, do that." Right? Is it wrong for me to send money to your mother? Is it wrong for me to help your family? I told you I would stop. I won't do it again. Look how you're reacting right now. You're mad again. So what do you want? You don't know, or you don't want to know? Hey. Keep your voice down, okay? Right, just keep running away! Is it done yet, Dad? Almost done, sweetie. Okay. Morning, Mom. Morning. Why aren't you guys ready? -Dad is making omelets. -Yeah. You can eat after you shower. You're gonna be late. Aw, Mom. Come on, sweetie. Okay. Let's go. Where did you sleep last night? At the office. I'm sorry. Last night… Let's drop it, Ambar. I'm going to take a shower. I'll drive the kids to school. GOOD MORNING, GILANG. SORRY, I FELL ASLEEP LAST NIGHT. I WAS EXHAUSTED. WHY DID YOU CALL? That's cute. -What is that? -These are two ice creams. And then this is the seller and the cart. Is that right? Let me see. What do you think? I just made it. Why is it purple and pink? The purple one is blueberry and the pink… Ayu. Why are you sitting there? It's okay, Ambar. Yeah, I like the company. What are you painting? Raindrops, I think. Mom, I told Auntie Yuli to come to my soccer game. Is that okay? You'll come, right? Sure. -Don't miss it. -Hello? Yes, Dina? Let's grab a cup of coffee. I'm done with my meetings. I'm still at the workshop. The kids are here too. Then bring them along. What is it? Nothing. I don't feel like going anywhere. Then tell me about it. Now. Dina. Ambar. Gilang slept at the office last night. What? Did you kick him out? No. Did you guys fight? And? Why? What happened? I don't know. What do you mean? He came home this morning. What? And then what happened? Nothing happened. That doesn't sound like nothing to me, Ambar. If it's empty, throw it away. It's their turn right now. Look, it's Ayu! Come on! Keep going. You got this! -She hasn't played yet. -She will soon. -Good luck! -Hi! Sorry I'm late. What's the score? Still 0-0. This is my friend, Dina. Oh, hello. -I'm Yuli. -Dina. Who is she? One of my students. What's your student doing here? Come on. Look! Ayu! Go, Ayu! -You got this! -Hey. No, it's fine, sit down. -Right on time, huh? -Yeah. Ayu! Get it, Ayu! Shoot, Ayu! -That was so cool! -Did you see that goal? I know, it was awesome. Good job, Ayu! You're amazing, Ayu. -That was a great pass. -I know. -You were great. -Thanks. -See you later. -Bye! Where have you been? I was with my friends. Why were you with friends? -Excuse me. -Yes? We're out of orange juice. That's okay, I'll just have water then. Auntie, you can share mine. It's okay, I already ordered water. It's okay, just drink this. Ayu. Auntie. -Ayu! -Auntie! It's fine, Yuli, just drink it. Really? All right then. Thank you, sweetie! -Sure. -Cutie. Good job. So we're sharing this? -Of course. -Together. Where is Mom going? Do you think something's going on between Yuli and Gilang? I don't know. -Are they close? -I don't know. Please stop crying. Gosh, don't cry, okay? Calm down. Calm down. It's probably just in your head. -I don't want my kids to see me like this. -Yes, I know. You look fine. It's okay. Where did Mom go, Dad? What's taking her so long? Oh, there she is. Mom, where did you go? What took you so long? I had to pee. Uh, I think I should go now. -Aw… -Really? Good. Should have left earlier. I'm going to meet Kemal. He told me he was in Jakarta. Auntie Yuli, where are you going? -I gotta go home. -Take care. All right, bye, everyone. -Bye, Auntie Yuli! -Take care, Yuli. Okay, bye! Why don't you answer that? It's fine. I'll call him back later. You mean when I'm not around? I'm gonna ask Gilang to speed up the work at the restaurant. What? They're already working faster than the initial schedule. Well, I want them to work even faster. Kemal, Gilang has… A lot of projects. But I want this project to end soon. Once the garden is done, everything will be done. Including us. What do you mean? Yuli. Let me just remind you. Gilang has a wife. His wife is your pottery teacher, right? I feel bad for her. YULI, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, BUT I FEEL LIKE IT'S MY FAULT. I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT IT. WHATEVER IT IS, I'M SORRY. -Ayu! -One sec! -Ayu, Bagas, that's enough. -Look, you used up all the battery. -Why can't I borrow it? -Bagas, give it to her. So annoying. Dad, Bagas won't let me borrow his phone. Dad! It's Bagas! -Where is he? -Dad, Grandma is here. -Grandma! -Hi, gorgeous! Mom. What are you doing here early in the morning? It's my birthday today. Is nobody gonna wish me a happy birthday? Right. Bagas, Ayu. -Say happy birthday. -Go on. -Happy birthday, Grandma! -Happy birthday, Grandma! Let me take you to school today, okay? -Yay! -All right? But, you have to eat breakfast first. Let's go. Thank you. Yes, thank you. I'll take the kids to school today, is that okay? I'm not asking for any other present this time. Just this. Okay. I'm gonna have breakfast with them. -Have a seat. -Okay. -I'm sorry I forgot your birthday. -It's all right. Did you sleep on the sofa? No, I just fell asleep here. Mom. Gilang. You're very kind. You've helped me a lot. And I know how much you love Ambar. Which is why I'm staying out of your problems. But don't worry. I won't let anyone else know about it. What matters is that you can solve this problem on your own. Let anyone know about what? You and Ambar's student. -How's the food? Good? -Yummy, Grandma. I'm off to work. Is that new? It's yours. You've never used it. Did you forget? You haven't had coffee. Tea is fine. Let me. What else did you tell your mother? About what? About us. I didn't tell her anything. What did she say? Your mother acts like she knows everything. Doesn't your mother know everything too? Your mother even knows about Yuli. What about Yuli? She thinks something is going on between me and Yuli. For the first time ever, you're willing to talk about our problems, And it's because of Yuli? Why would your mom say something like that? Where have you been all this time? Answer me first. Why should I? You never answer mine. -Ambar… -It doesn't matter how she found out. The question is, do you really have something going on with Yuli? Yuli did nothing wrong. That's not an answer. Are you dating her? No, Ambar. Are you crazy? Why would you say that? If it's not true, then why do you have to know how my mother found out? Why are you panicking? Why does everyone think there's something between me and Yuli? Maybe because everyone can see right through you. See what? I'm just thinking about how Yuli would feel. Stop saying her name. I've been trying so hard. So hard to find the root of our problems. I even went to a marriage counselor. I went through everything in my head. All while protecting our children's feelings. And yours. And all you care about is that woman's feelings! You're not the only one suffering in this house, Ambar. I'm trying to find a solution too. Then where is it? You think I can focus on that now? While we're arguing like this? You seem perfectly fine going back and forth to Bogor. For work! And I do it for you, and for the kids. You are always so quick to judge. If you don't want me to judge you, then speak up. Say something! Stop running away! Instead, what did you do? You go running into another woman's arms. I'm stressed out thinking about all this on my own! Always. You always think that you're the only one stressing out about this. That you're the only one who thinks about the house. You're the only one thinking about the kids. You're the only one tired… I am tired! I am exhausted! Stop overreacting. Do you really want to ruin our marriage? Me? You're the one who's ruining our marriage. -Stop blaming me for everything… -No, listen to me. We. I. I have been trying to fix our problems while you run away to that woman. -You're the one who tore us apart. -I didn't do anything! Exactly. That's where you went wrong. You never do anything. You just run. Run from everything. You never face your own problems. You never could. -Never! -Stop saying I haven't done anything! -No, you can never do anything. -Say that one more time… I will slap you! Can you? Can you? Go ahead. Go on. Hit me! Stop! -See you tomorrow. -Okay. Mom's not here yet, Ayu? I don't know. I haven't seen her car. Let's just sit down. Okay. MS. RINI, BAGAS' TEACHER Yes? Yes, ma'am. I am on my way right now. Ma'am, I'm so sorry. Thanks for waiting with them. I'm so sorry. It's okay. I don't get it. Why do people still want to get married? For love? I'm sorry to bother you at work. I don't know who else to talk to. It's okay. I don't understand… How did my mother find out about Yuli? I've never told anyone anything. You're the only one who knows. -Dina. -Yeah? Did you…? You didn't… Seriously? Your mother was worried sick. She kept asking me and calling me about you. I'm so sorry, Ambar. You're unbelievable. Ambar. Lately, I've been asking myself this question over and over. Why did I decide to marry Gilang? And funnily enough, I can't remember why. How do you know if a couple still has hope? And when they're beyond saving? Of all of the couples who come here, not all of them hope to fix their marriage. Some only want validation for their decision to get divorced. I'm here not to save people's marriages. I'm here to help each of you to find the happiness that you need. Should you stay together? Should you split? You're the only ones who know. You're the ones who experience it. You decide. Not me. So… When do we know if it's time to stop trying? Is it as simple as knowing when we're not happy anymore? Listen, Ambar. Holding on to a marriage is something that you do for life. It begins when the two of you make your vows. Even if you do part ways, there are still a lot of things to fight for together. But if that's the happiness that you need… Hi, Gilang. Hey, Kemal. Thanks for coming. Thanks for inviting me. Not all gardens I design get a grand opening like this. Is that your father? Yeah. I know what Yuli is saying to him right now. "I'm sorry. Even though I am no longer dating your son, I promise I will keep in touch with you." Yuli must've told you that we broke up, right? No. Really? I thought she did. Are you all right? Are you? -What? -Are you okay? You seem to be very distracted. I think I've always been distracted since the first time we met. Right. Why don't I just get off at Blok M? It's pretty close to my place. Oh, didn't I tell you? I'm going to the office. That's fine, I'll just… I'll go with you to your office, and from there, I'll just order a ride. All right, okay. What are you doing at work so late?? Actually, I've been sleeping at work two nights in a row now. I'm gonna order a bike ride now. Why don't you just get a taxi? It's really late. You're right, a taxi would be better. Do you want to wait inside? -All right. -Okay. -Thank you. -After you. Is that…? Ambar. Ambar! Ambar! Ambar, roll down the window! Ambar, please. Ambar, let's just talk about this. Ambar. Ambar, can you open the window? Ambar! I can explain. I want a divorce. Did Ambar get the wrong idea? You should go home. I can help explain everything to Ambar if you want. I can talk to her. Ambar wants a divorce. She wants a divorce. I don't want to lose her. I'm not ready to lose her. I don't want to lose the kids. What should I do? What should I do? I don't know what to do. It hurts so much, but… What else can I do? I don't even know. What are you hoping for now? Do you want them to get divorced or…? No. I don't know, Auntie. I don't even know what I want. But I feel a lot better after talking to you. Thank you, Auntie. Thank you for what? I've just been listening to you. Actually, I rarely listen to stories that are told from… The bad side? Yuli. I've never considered you a bad person. It's just that you fell in love with the wrong person. You're just hurting yourself. Honestly, Ambar, I feel so bad for what has happened. How did it end up like this? It's not your fault. It was bound to happen. But are you sure? I mean… divorce? Don't you want to try working it out through mediation first? Thanks for accepting my apology. Yeah. Promise me that you'll call me if you need anything, okay? Promise? I promise. -You do? -Yes. -Drive safe. -Okay. Hey, Bagas. -Where's your sister? -Right there. Come on, Auntie! Have they showered yet? Bagas and Ayu. What do you want? Make it quick. I… You want to talk about your relationship with Gilang? How are you guys? I admit… that I did fall in love with Gilang. But there was never a place for me in his heart, and… there never will be. I fell in love with a man who loves his wife so dearly. What am I supposed to say? I just want to apologize. For letting my feelings go this far. And for falling for the wrong person, to the point that you got the wrong idea. There's nothing special about our relationship except for my feelings for Gilang. You asked me how Gilang was, right? He's broken. He's not the only one broken. Well, then. I should go. Maybe… You might think that I know nothing, or that I'm overstepping saying this, but I know… that you don't have to go down this path. Goodbye. SOUTH JAKARTA DISTRICT COURT Dad? I've missed you. Are you going to sleep here tonight? How can I convince you and make you believe me when I say there's nothing between me and Yuli? That's not the only reason why I filed for a divorce. You don't love me anymore, is that it? Marriage is not just based on love, Gilang. I've just had enough. I'm tired of being the only one who cares about this relationship. Of being the only one who tries to fix every problem. I can't do it anymore. I'm sorry. I truly am. Maybe my way was wrong. I just wanted to make you and the kids happy. Gilang. Do you really think that we're happy now? Are you happy? Why should we hold on to this marriage if neither of us is happy? Please, don't leave me. Ambar, please don't leave me. I don't want to wake up one day and find out that I'm no longer your husband. If you don't want to get divorced just because you're afraid of losing me or losing the kids… Ambar. Please. I'm sorry. I think it's best if you don't come to court. The sooner we get this done, the better. Thank you. For everything. -Bagas? -Yeah? When is Dad coming home? I don't know. Maybe he's busy with work. Oh. But he will come home, right? Yes. I miss him. Me too. Once again, I apologize, ma'am. It's all right. Bagas. Hey. Don't do it again, okay? Think of your mother. Excuse me. Let's go home. Why aren't you mad at me like last time? You already apologized. That's not fair! If you can forgive me, then why can't you forgive Dad? I feel sorry for him. Bagas! GILANG & AMBAR'S BACKYARD Why is my name there? You're the one who did the sketch. Well, we made it together. Do you like it? I love it. I'm going to put some plants here. Right over there, and then two chairs for us to sit. We can have coffee, and the staghorn fern goes here. I can't wait to see this. I'll start working on it. And over here… Yes, Dina? Yeah, I'm about to leave. I'm picking up the kids first. Thank you. -Dina! -Ambar. You two stay here with Auntie Dina, okay? He came? I don't know, I just got here. Hold my bag. Okay. COURTROOM -Is the plaintiff present? -Yes, Your Honor. -And the defendant? -Present, Your Honor. The case is open. The court in session holds the reading of the results of the mediation. Are both parties ready? They are, Your Honor. On this date, the result of mediation is that there is no agreement between the two parties. Sir. Can I talk to my wife for a moment? Of course. Your Honor. Permission for my client to speak to his wife. Please, go ahead. I don't want to run away anymore. Yesterday, you asked me if I was happy. I couldn't stop thinking about it. And then I realized… that you are the source of my happiness. You. Our kids. If I wasn't happy then, that's because I hadn't realized that yet. All this time, I've never let you be a part of my life. I'm sorry. I'm sorry it has taken this to make me realize… that I still want to spend the rest of my life with you, no matter how hard it will be. Together. I'm truly sorry. I love you too much. I made a mistake. Your mistake is my mistake too, Ambar. Let's go home. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Bagas? -Catch me if you can! -Okay. Honey? -Here you go, honey. -What's this?
