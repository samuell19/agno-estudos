Thanks. Did you remember the candles? Yes, Mrs Tanquerelle. - 8? - You said 9. So I did! Blue? No... pink... Wasn't it for your daughter? Of course! How silly of me! Goodbye! Those bitches! You went through a red light! - What? - A red light! - Were you in a rush? - Yes, sort of. Ouch!... Take it easy! - Does it hurt? - It sure does. - Where? - My knee. I fell on it. - It bends, so it's not broken. - Really! There's a pharmacy over there. Doesn't this have to be reported? - I'm in a hurry. - What about my papers?! - Which papers? - Those there! - Here... lean back there. - Oh, gosh! That really hurts! "Composition in G major and allegro, by Georgio Dello Strado." - A you a musician? - You missed one! I'm sorry! - My books!... - Just let's go... come on! We can't leave my bike there! I'm not going to try and lift it off! Come on now! Hello... Mum... it's me. Would you set the table, and I'll be there in half an hour. I had a collision with some guy. He ran a red light. Don't worry, I'm perfectly OK. So is he. Let's wait for the x-rays. There's no need at all for that. I can drop you off, but I'm really in a hurry, alright? I'm told it's nothing to worry about!! You address...? 23, rue de la Montagne Sainte-Geneviève. - Profession? - Teacher. - So you teach trumpet? - No. I've always wanted to meet a trumpet teacher. - Sorry I can't oblige. - Let's go! Just lean on me. You have some of that throat medication from the Vosges? I've been looking for it everywhere, for 2 months. They've been out of stock. That's very annoying! It was the same 4 years ago, with star anise. It's very good... I don't know why. Herbal teas are good for everything. Shall I drop you off, or can you manage on your own? Are you going to the Latin Quarter? No, but I can drop you off. You can put me down. Goodbye. But as I'm here anyway... ...I'll take some of that. Stay there!... Your hair just caught a reflection... - It was wonderful! - My hair? Rays from the sun... mirrored in a bus window... ...and reflected through the jar... It was very pretty. I'll let you know when I see a bus coming! - It's funny you know... - What is? I feel I remember you from somewhere. You weren't on Noirmoutier Island, 3 years ago? No. But you remind me of someone, too. - I'm not too heavy for you? - No. Because there's not only the knee... There's the ankle. But your arm's alright? The arm's not too bad. Be careful, it's slippery. I know the Sorbonne. If you took philosophy in '54 at Louis-le-Grand... ...you would have had Chauffard? Did you know him? Did I know Chauffard!? He held his lecture notes together with clothes pegs! His crazy sophistry! "I would rather plant cabbages... at least I could watch them grow!" And the socks he wore! Don't laugh... in 5 years I'll be like Chauffard. With a gammy leg into the bargain! A gammy leg! We probably passed each other on those stairs a thousand times. We probably brushed against each other. Are you sure you weren't on Noirmoutier, 3 years ago? Just a moment... What were you like in 1952? I was in a trance... preparing a first-year course. - No... physically. - Same height... not as heavy. With knees like new. You were translating Courteline into Greek. Yes. - You're Lemercier! - You're Tanquerelle! Tanquerelle! Lise Tanquerelle! Lise! So...? The same except for the hair! You're too kind. Let's not get carried away... How far back are we going?... It was... ah yes... - That was it! - Yes. Let's go! This time round, you'll give me your address. If you like. - She'll do for him! - Enough! You really want to my address? YES! - Grab your chance, Antoine! - She'll grow on you... - A funny lot! - They have their moments. You're obviously busy, so... Sorry to make things difficult for you, but... - Do you have anything to write with? - Never! Cordelier... ...could I have your pen, instead of your cheek? At your service, sire. Don't overdo it! - I don't have my glasses... - Take mine. Thanks. - Shall I include my phone number? - Yes. I'll give you mine as well. Thank you. Just write it on there... I'll copy it off later. Cordelier, stop pulling faces. - Thank you. - See you soon, eh? See you soon! So... Eteocles calls on all combatants to the ramparts. The chorus of women's lamentations rise to the heavens... ...allowing Eteocles... ...to rebuke them with a few well-chosen words... [Speaking Greek] Do you do this job for fun or money? [Speaking Greek] ...that I would freely translate as... " God, save us from women... "On good days they are impudent... "and on bad ones, a plague on the city." - Male chauvinist pig! - Aeschylus, young lady. Yoo-hoo! - Is that you, mummy? - Yes, it's me. We didn't think you were coming. What day is it? My birthday. Oh! I'd completely forgotten! Hello, Suzanne. - Do you remember Rudy? - Vaguely. Hello, mum. - Hello. - The cake's in the kitchen. Hello, sweetie! Don't you remember when Rudy came to Vichy? The year we made those hoods... ...with the huge bouquets. Where are you going? She's gone to fix the cake, Nanna. - Did your father phone you? - No. That doesn't surprise me. Rudy had just dumped Véra, and he came to Vichy... ...in that huge car, whose name I forget... It was an Isotta Fraschini! That was it... And he wore a tweed blazer. Hello, Paul? Have you forgotten your daughter's birthday? You haven't forgotten? Well, that's nice of you. You think of us all the time? Thanks. Here's your daughter. Daddy. Hello, daddy! Paul's preparing his exhibition. - I'm very glad. - You've said that for 4 years. Paul was nice... He was easy to get on with. In your whole life, have you known anyone you couldn't get on with? Oh, no... not really! Even my father, whom I never had the pleasure of knowing... ...still has a place in your heart. How can a man as tall as he was, not have a place?! Lise! Yes? What's he want now? It's a call for you. A gentleman who says he's forgotten his glasses. His glasses?! Hello, is that you? I hope I'm not disturbing you. It's about my glasses. Oh, I'm confused. Yes... they're in my pocket. No... I wasn't sitting down... You didn't interrupt anything. No, no... You'll pop over? You'll have to change bus 3 times. What bus? Oh yes. Where I can drop them? You can bring them to me this evening, to Saint Germain Court? That's the Louvre! You live at rue de la Montagne Ste-Geneviève. No... Rue de la Montagne Ste-Geneviève is where I sleep. And St-Germain Court is where I sing. You sing there? And then, if you don't think it boring... ...we could go to dinner together with friends. Well, with some people, anyway. I'd really love to... I'll see you later. 'Bye for now. I have to go to a concert tonight. Who with? With some people... friends. Close the curtains. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Knockout! What a shame... It was going well. - Did you think it was good? - Yes. Did you like that extra kick in the "Miserere"? It was like breaking wind! The "Agnus Dei" is not as good. I told them we'll have to rework it. Could we get under cover? Under cover? Oh, I'm sorry! How stupid of me! It looks like your knee's better. Yes... the sun... some heat. My sandwich! Give me a hot toddy! We really copped a soaking! How about some salami? Your head's dripping all over the place! Prof. Pelletier. Dean Lavergne. Mrs Tanquerelle. You would have known Lise at Louis-le-Grand. Maybe... yes... I'm 20 years older! Unlucky about the weather. It's a shame... It was very good. Are you in the National Education Choir? We just have fun... We're modest amateurs. Not all that modest! We sang at Flins, in front of 2,000 standing workers. When Mireille Mathieu sang, it was 20,000! Say... do you remember Flins? - Do you have a phone? - Over there. Thanks. Hello, Guérin? What?! Where? I'm on my way. Sorry, but I have to go. But we were supposed to have dinner together. But... Don't touch anything till the inspector comes. Here's the boss, Guérin. It's the chief investigator... A big wheel! Let the inspector through... No photographs! Hi, Guérin. Hello, boss... I've been looking for you everywhere. - Even at Mr Tanquerelle's. - Why at Paul's place? I don't know. Our big chief's over there. Was he at the boxing match? No, he's here because... So who's this? - You don't know? - No. He's a national deputy. Hello, boss. - Good evening. - Good evening, sir. A nasty business. If this is political, it'll be the last straw... A week from my getting my sash! Your sash? I'm due to get the Legion of Honour... ...didn't you know? Yes, of course. After the ceremony, my wife's giving a reception. I hope you'll join us. And you'd hope, that in the meantime... Don't forget that the assassination of Jaurès... ...triggered the 1st World War. I trust that won't happen here, sir. Inspector... please don't take it as being sexist... ...but your earrings?... Oh, I'm sorry! You might've told me. I was preoccupied. Vincent Grandville... a deputy in the majority. Former Minister of Industry. What's that? I don't know... a cat... a tiger? No, it's a leopard. I'll be in the office in two hours. I want a report by then. - Could that have happened from his fall? - Certainly not. What would you say it was? - It looks like he's been punched. - Recent? Seeing that coagulation isn't evident... - So it's recent or not? - It is, apparently. Any witnesses? Someone who saw nothing... someone who thought he saw something... Someone who can't remember. It's nothing new to me... I fought in the Ardennes... ...I fought in Indo-China... I've seen death close up. 10 days before St John's day... with a knife? It's a ritual crime. I saw a man wearing a hood, running... ...and I swear I heard gunshots. Could I have a bit of quiet please?! Silence! All of you... Shut up! Before the deputy was assassinated, he'd been punched. Did anyone here witness a fight? Madam... If he'd been attacked, I would have noticed it... I was sitting next to him. Then you can tell me if he had a slight wound on his left cheek. Not before he left... but when he came back, yes. Came back from where? During the 3rd round, he was gone for a few minutes. He said a drunk slammed the door in his face. Coming out of where? Well... the toilets. It's more than 200 metres from the crime scene. Who would've thought of it? You're not being blamed for anything! Anyone here? I'm closing up! - And you're...? - The washroom attendant. Well, excuse me... But it seems you may have witnessed an incident. It seems one of your customers had a door slammed in his face. Is a "door" the name you give it? I don't call that a door in the face... I call it a sock in the kisser! If I told you, you'd never believe me. I'm all ears, madam! I was attending to the ladies' room... ...when I heard a yell from the gents'. I ran over and saw this pair calling each other everything... And I mean everything! Then one got a hell of a clout... I don't know him. I do. The one who gave it, is my Sansandre. - Who? - Alexandre Mignonac. - Alexandre Mignonac? - The deputy from Aurillac. Is he a friend of yours? - No. Why? - You called him your "Sansandre". Well, I'm from Aurillac. He's always on TV. You can keep changing channels but he's always there. Alexandre Mignonac? How about that, my boy?! Get me his address. When he's in Paris, Deputy Mignonac lives at 5 Velasquez Ave. Thanks. He lives at 5 Velasquez Ave. He's been telephoned, but there's no answer. We'll go there anyway. Do you think it's a political crime? The Cantal deputy killed by the Calvados deputy... ...near the toilets of the Wagram Centre. Not exactly epic stuff! I'm surprised they put ME on the case, as it's going to create a big stir. It belongs to the grand sorcerer... Superman. Beretti! Inspector Beretti's in bed with a temperature... flu. Do you want the opinion of a male chauvinist pig? You could profit from your senior's flu... ...to make a name for yourself. "Women at the forefront". It'll get you some great write-ups. But if I make one slip-up... There's number 5... What should we do? Albert, you go and cover the service entrance. - We'll go in. - Not yet. - What time is it? - 5.40. Beretti'd wait until the allowed time. No... first he'd discuss it over lunch with the Speaker of the House! The big careers are made under umbrellas! Whereas we'd just climb up there... ...and charge through the doors. Exactly... Now come on! We can wait for daybreak... It's another 20 minutes. Take a rest... Stretch out on the front seat. Lower the back-rest. That's nice! Here's Bertrand's raincoat. - Do you want something to warm you up? - No. Can I find you a coffee? Does Beretti usually get this sort of attention? No... HE gets tucked in! You saw the press? The bastards must've followed us. Hello, yes? What an idiot! - Dr Mignonac? - That's right. CID... I need to ask you some questions.. Can we go back inside? If you wanted to talk to me you should've seen me at home. The legal time is 6am. You've got to be joking... As if it'd matter! So what do you want to ask question? Last night in the Wagram Centre... Did you happen to slap... Grandville? Yes, I slapped him! And if he was still alive... I'd slap him again! I'd be happy to go and slap his corpse! So if that's what you want to know... goodbye, inspector! Picot! Cassard! Stop the car! Albert... get after him! Wait! Hurry up! I can have your licence for this! I had to give way to the pedestrians on the crossing! ...I brake... and you hit me up the arse! So I lose my licence for that?! The deputy's not going to run off to Venezuela! Organise an APB for airports and railway stations. Wait for me! Those Parisians fly off the handle about anything! Pick me up in 20 minutes. So, couldn't you catch that man? What? No. If I staged a holdup, you wouldn't be able to catch me. Really? Why not? I'd take a bus... They've got express lanes. So while you're waiting to stage a holdup, hurry up... and be good at school. - Lise! - Yes? There was a phone call last night for you... from... What was his name? - Antoine Lemercier. - What did he want? He's looking for his glasses. Oh! The poor guy! You didn't get back to him last night? Last night, at least! It said on the radio that Mr de Grandville, the deputy for Calvados... was murdered last night... ...and that your daughter was in charge of inquiries. Your daughter didn't spend the night primping and preening. - Lise! - I'm coming! It's a very pleasant house. Have you had breakfast? No, but... Mr Lemercier... my sister, Lise's Mo... Delighted to meet you. Please sit down. I missed breakfast because I had to leave so early. Had to change bus 3 times. You don't have a car? No. I had a moped, until I ran into... My daughter. So... tea or coffee? - Tea would be nice. - Fine! - Darjeeling, if you have it. - Alright. "Darjeeling"? Oh yes. Charming! Excuse me for receiving you, dressed like this. And I, for coming so early... But I have a morning lecture... ...and I'm lost without my glasses. - I believe you're a musician. - Just an amateur. Do you play trumpet? No... No... But if I felt there was a demand for it... Mum... Mr Lemercier is professor of Greek. Professor? So you're a public servant, just like my daughter. Where's Suzanne, with his coffee? Suzanne! Suzanne! Mum... come... Excuse me. Surely. Why don't you want him to know? - I don't want to tell him, now. - Why haven't you told him? I haven't found the time. I don't need to tell the whole world that I'm a cop. - Besides, he wouldn't approve. - Nobody approves. - Just what IS Darjeeling? - They just don't approve in principle. This is Darjeeling. Were you admiring the wisteria? No... I was just wondering if I could jump over that lattice. I didn't notice it the first time. It was night-time, the first time. It was the night before the holidays. Why had you come? On the fallacious pretext... and it WAS a fallacious pretext... ...of retrieving some books you'd borrowed from me... ...including Hesiod's "Erga kai Hemerai"... ...the Grouillard translation. It was a beautiful June night... ...and the Grouillard was in your bedroom. Quite by chance! You were wearing a kind of bolero with a sort of Persian pattern... Extremely erotic! No, I was wearing a blue sweater... I remember it very well. And what happened? What happened was... your mother! At which point, there followed my vaudeville act... Up, up and over the fence! Then the long, long holidays. - Do you want sugar? - No, thanks. Antoine, I have a confession. Me too... I've something to tell you. It's wonderful to be able to eat outdoors in Paris... ...particularly on such a nice day. Only problem in summer is the wasps. Especially when you're eating melon. - Not so much in Lot. - How come? There aren't so many wasps down around Lot. Oh, Guérin, my boy! I'd like you to meet my good friend Marcel Guérin. Mr Lemercier is a singer as well as... And here's another friend of yours. Shit!... I mean... Gosh! - Don't you have a lecture? - Yes. Come with me. Suzanne! Fix my things... I have to go. Lovely day... There aren't many wasps yet. No, there aren't many wasps. Guérin... I need a word... Come in here! - Anything new on Mignonac? - No. - You have the file on him? - Yes. Good. Born 15th of March 1925, in Béziers. During the July 14 parade in 1939... ...he publicly slapped the prefect of Hérault. In 1942, he removed the German flag from the Béziers opera house. I'll pass over accusations of incitement to kill... ...and insulting the head of state. Has been re-elected as deputy, for 25 years. Let's go! Your friend Antoine is quite crazy! You stay and amuse yourself... I have to be off. - Which way? - What? - Perhaps you could give me a lift. - No... can't, sorry! - Where are you going? - To the Sorbonne. - Can't we drop him? - Is your office that way? Further down on the left. So, ladies... this has been a delightful interlude. What are you doing?! See you again! Goodbye. - Antoine Lemercier. - Cassard. I'm sorry. This is hopeless! Hardly surprising... There's a cop there, to make a mess of it! He's doing what he can. You know the story of the chicken chasseur? I've heard it... it's funny. - I don't know it. - Yes you do, Guérin. Look at him. He looks like something out of "Punch and Judy". I was in a brawl with the police on the Boulevard Saint-Michel... On the corner of Rue de la Hachette... We stripped one cop naked. I still have his cap and his cape at home. Dean Lavergne... You met him yesterday, Lise. The tall guy with glasses. He hung the cop's boots on a street lamp... ...beside the Declaration of the Rights of Man. We've heard enough of that. Drop it! Pull over! Go to blazes! You can drop me here. - This alright for you, here? - Yes, it's fine. - Goodbye gentlemen. - Goodbye. It's fine... I just go through there, and I'm there! You've got your glasses? Have a good day. - Hey!... can we have lunch? - No. How about a cup of tea? - What time? - 5 o'clock. - No. - 6 o'clock, then? - Alright. - Where's your office? - Next to the palace. - 6 o'clock in the Palace Square? I'd rather meet in a café. In this weather we don't want to be inside. In this square, then. - 6 o'clock in this square here. - Yes, that's fine. - Hey! - What? You changed your hairstyle. It's a pity you lost those 20 years. How long is it since you were married? Are you interested in a woman's coiffure, now? She doesn't have a coiffure. She has hair. Your wife is charming, but you look worn out. That can lead to unexpected alliances. Lise and I have saved up those 20 years. We've avoided the error of early marriage... ...boredom with good food, loss of sexuality. We find each other 20 years later... ...intact, in the prime of life... me having new hope... ...and Lise with a readymade daughter. That's a nice friend you have... Very amusing to strip cops. Whatever happened between you and I, 3 years ago... ...was all very nice, but it was just a fleeting affair. What a memory it is!... That's all it is... a memory. Don't let it become an obsession. Boss... The 5 guys fried in the Renault 16... - ...there's a witness. - We'll talk later. Anything new on Mignonac? He's not at home... We tried the town hall... Morning, boss... It's an awl... once used in car manufacture... Abandoned 20 years ago. It was for sewing upholstery... No prints. - Hello, doctor. - Hello... here we have it. The point went between the 6th and 7th ribs, 4 cm into the heart. Death was almost instantaneous. He was still digesting food. - Want to know what he stuffed himself with? - Yuk! Bring me a latte... I haven't eaten. Picot, give me the blow-up of the awl. There. Tell the chief I'm here. This leopard would have to be a car badge. Find it for me. How would I do that? This is pre-war. So... You've something to tell me? Big Louis tied up the 3 Marouani brothers in the Renault 16... And Fernand set it on fire. - Little Fernand? - No. Ah, that Fernand! Guérin... It's not because he cleared off with my "wife". - Has Marcellin got the dope on Tréport? - Yes. Send him to "Printania au Paradisio" and to the "Bar Bleu.' I want Big Louis and Fernand in custody within an hour. - Right away. - There's a call for you. Can I take it there? Hello... Oh, mum... It's flooding in the kitchen? Can't you get a plumber at this hour? Oh! Use my name! Love you, mum. We've got the Montlhéry molester. - It was Gaspard, as usual. - Had to be. He tried it on me... the other day in my office! He did! Come in. Ah!... Tanquerelle. What do you think of it? It's a fantastic look, sir. - You really think so? - Oh yes! The situation's now explosive. One deputy murdered... another in flight. The majority party has its problems... but to go round killing each other... It's a bit uncomfortable, just there. I was hoping for a better beginning... ...but this has started with a major blunder. It sure has. OK if I arrest your tailor? Take it easy! The minister has phoned me to ask... ...why I've got a woman running this case. Give the case to Beretti... His fever's gone down. You have my total confidence. It dangles a little bit. - It dangles? - Yes, it dangles. Not only the collar... the lapels dangle. Now it dangles even more! I wonder if this party will even take place. Come in. Sorry to disturb you, but it's important. There's a call for you. It concerns Mignonac. I'll take the call. - Hello, is that the inspector? - Yes, ma'am. A man? I'm listening! I know where Deputy Mignonac is. - What's the Montespan complex like? - It's huge. Warn the police station at Saint-Cloud. This has to be kept under wraps, with no fanfare. Come on, Guérin! Quick! Hang on! Stop!! - What? - I have a problem. - Which is...? - Your mother just called. "Could I help her with her plumber?" Hey, Illouz... Mignonac hasn't come out? Definitely not. Excuse me. "Le salon Antonio"... Do you know it? Antonio's? It's right there. Can't you see it? There you are... I was just saying to myself... "Maybe they thought it was a joke?" - Mignonac's here? - Yes. - Can we go inside? - Of course. Come in, boys. If only Lucien were here! He's my No.1 boy! He's going to be wild! Where is he? He's in the steam room. I mean where's Dr Mignonac? Right over there, for goodness sake! See... that's his car. What floor's he on? I don't know. He's shacked up with a woman. Guérin, you have to do a thorough search. There's a lot of apartments! You've got the whole team! Can I give you a quick blow-wave? A quick one on the house. - Forgive the intrusion... thank you. - That's alright. - Guérin, come here. - What? Come here quickly! Look. What? How about the bimbo! You idiot! - Mignonac! - Oh, shit! - Where's the boss? - That's me! - The inspector! - Under the drier. We've got him... He's here. - Huh? - We spotted Mignonac! God almighty! My rollers! - That sex maniac told me to come and look. - What sex maniac? Picot. He spotted this bimbo on a balcony... It's this way. And then? And the next moment... - Stop. - What? - The bimbo! - What bimbo? We met a little while ago... Are you the caretaker? The watchman. Do you know the name of that girl on the bike? I'm not the caretaker. Do you want to come in to headquarters? Oh, gosh... Her name's Vallier. Have you seen a Dr Mignonac here? - Don't know him. - A friend of Miss Vallier. Here... they come and go all the time. I can't keep track of all their names. What sort of doctor is he? He may be a murderer. Miss Vallier doesn't have murderer friends. She's a good-natured person, which is unusual here. There are lots of Kanaks here, ma'am. The brake's still a bit stiff. - Or I'm just weak. - Show me. Ma'am. CID. - Did I say something... - No. They're looking for a doctor. Yes... Dr Mignonac. Hold these. I like you cheerful demeanour... ...but I have to warn you that the penalty for harbouring a criminal... - Harbouring? - Yes... if you're hiding someone. My uncle's not a criminal... and I'm not hiding him. Let's go and see. We'll follow you. It's this way. What was she on about the brakes?... I can't see... It's here. Guérin. Police! Open up! Police! Call your uncle. Open the door, uncle... It's the police. - He must be there. - We saw him. Verdier? Stand aside, miss. Calling your lawyer? Precisely! Get yourself dressed, and come with us. I can't be true. Don't worry, my pet... I've been through this with the Gestapo. There weren't any women cops in those days. Wrong foot. Will I be told what happens? You're coming with us. I'll have to change... What shall I wear? Aren't you going to cuff me? If you insist. Christine Vallier, born in Briançon 22nd March 1952, father unknown. ...came to live in Paris with her mother, on Rue Ordener. - Clean police record. - Thanks. Christine Vallier, age 22... ...failed high-school diploma. It was the oral. Not something to be proud of... ...but it didn't stop you from becoming a decorator. - What do you decorate? - Apartments. I've just decorated one. Was that yours? Nothing's very easy, when you're just getting started. I know. I had to start once, too. Meanwhile, who is it who's paying the rent? - Uncle? - Yes. Drop me at Trocadero Square. So what's all this nonsense about uncle and niece? Christine's your little girlfriend. Not my girlfriend. Christine is my mistress! I'm single, no children. There's no law against it. You're the one who makes the laws. I just don't understand this "uncle" nonsense. Didn't that other silly old fool pose as her godfather? - Grandville? - Yes. Stop! Tell me Miss Vallier... Do you take me for an idiot? So you have a "godfather" as well? Certainly. And you sleep with him? You have a perfect right to have lovers... ...and call them "uncle"... and in addition ...have a sugar-daddy. That's your right, on one condition... That they don't kill each other. If you only knew!... I'd like to... very much! Forgot something else? I wanted to make sure if you did push Granville down the stairs. It was totally insane, for that garbage to be at Christine's place! Wasn't he paying the rent? That was the least of it. With a mug like his... and at his age... Grandville was her fancy-man... and you the one who really loved her. Exactly. Drop me at Pont Neuf. It's going OK... I think we can hold him. See what you can get, and I'll join you, as soon as... - As soon as you can. - Right. Keep it running... I'll be back. I'm sorry I'm so late! The cup of tea has to be for another time. I've no time right now. I'd hoped we'd be in time to watch the tide come in. By the time we get to your place... ...we wouldn't get down to Honfleur before 9 o'clock. - Honfleur? - Yes. - This is news to me. - Yes, because I've been thinking... There are 3 solutions. 1... a hotel... too vulgar. 2... your place... there's your family. 3... my place... it's too cramped. It's so nice for couples to walk on the beach. Couples? Listen... Antoine... Ah! "Antoine". What else should I say? We're old pals, that's all. But all the same.. I threw myself on you this morning. Does that make us a "couple"? What is it? You forget one very important detail... Your hair-do. You've been to the hairdresser... That's a strong sign! Better, eh? You should be thinking about how I'd look in a bathing cap. Hold this. Hello. Guérin? Yes, it's me. What?! Where?! Who?!... My God! I'm on my way! Maurice Rombard has just been murdered. The Saint-Denis deputy? Yes, on Avenue de la République. - How? Where? - Avenue de la République. Same as Grandville. Grandville wasn't killed in the same place. Killed by being stabbed with an awl. - Stabbed with an awl? - Yes. How weird!... Every time we meet... Get in the cab, quick! Your bag rings... You make a call... ...then someone assassinates a member of parliament. Just what are you? Ambulance officer? Police inspector? Fire chief? I'm no fire-chief. 2 deputies in 2 days! What a party! - What can it mean? - The investigation will be hushed up. That would amaze me. - Why? - I'm the one in charge of it. What?! This way, inspector. Exactly the same. See! Here's State Security. Lemercier! What are you doing here? Come on, old chap! Did you see who's here? Have you become a demonstrator, now?! This is the last gasp of the Right. It's a provocation. The investigation will be hushed up. I'd be amazed if it were hushed up. Hey... no! It's alright! If you don't mind! This takes me back 20 years, boys! No... come back... Get off me! Antoine! It's tear gas! Leave me alone!... You can't stay here, boss. - Antoine! - I don't have a handkerchief. Antoine! Antoine! Come on... Get down! Certainly not! Don't be absurd! Don't you see this is crazy?! Now get out of there! I'm not leaving here without my friends. 5 minutes ago we were leaving for Honfleur. I could offer you Ile de Ré... Travel by paddy-wagon and a weekend in the fortress. You've deceived me ignominiously, madam. Get this lot out of my sight! "Dear Antoine, we've shed some tears this afternoon. "I'd like to believe that they were not all due "to the tear-gas. "I'd like to believe also that our kiss "was not solely due to the joy of getting your glasses back. What about the young decorator? I don't know what will become of that person. Hello, ma'am. Sherlock Holmes'd be better off staying at home... ...making preserves! That doesn't sound too good, Beretti. Doesn't seem too good for you either. This deputy carnage! Is this for the boss's medal... ...a new hair-do for the party? Yes. What else would it be for? I'd love to mess up your hair anytime, sweetheart! Hi, boss. Hello, boss. So... between the 6th and 7th rib... exactly like the other one. Any new information on the little leopard? I's an outdated tool... Not used in 20 years. We knew that much yesterday! Cassard... witnesses? 63 protesters, 40 people at windows... ...5 of our guys... We got bugger all. This is what we found on the deceased. "Dear Antoine, yesterday we... " How did this cutie get mixed up with these deputies. "Dear Antoine..." No, that's a bit dry... "My darling..." No, that's too strong. He'll think I'm a tease. "Antoine." No. "My dear Antoine." That's it! "My dear Antoine, yesterday we shed some tears... etc. Albert, can you go down Rue de la Montagne Sainte-Geneviève? I'll only be a second. Who are you looking for? I wanted to leave a note for Mr Antoine Lemercier. Oh... the professor's gone away. - Where to? - Honfleur. For how long? Just a little while. He took his mynah bird. It's going to look funny on the train. The train? What train? When? 1.54 from Saint-Lazare. He changes at Pont-Audemer. That's where he buys the seed for his mynah... He'll look so funny with the bird... Saint-Lazare station, Albert. You've got 4 minutes. Fasten your seatbelts! The train for Lisieux is now leaving... Close the doors please. Departing on track 15. Police! Stop the train! Find Lemercier for me. I'll just be a minute... keep the engine running. Police! Get out... Quick! Quick! Here... this is for you. That's not Lise is it? What's your mynah's name? Augustin, Answer the inspector. "My name is Augustin, the lovely bird. I'm 7 years old. "On the night of the crime, my master and I... "were playing poker with some professors, and other birds." There you are. Are you inquiring into whether Ii have a sense of humour? But it was quite a shock... to leave a girl in a Persian bolero... ...to be faced with a cop in petticoats. I thought you liked the petticoat type. Does my being a cop as well, upset you? I'm no great lover of cops... ...but most of them don't bother me. I'll tell you a secret. I often imagined myself in the mounted police... ...charging sabre in hand at the strikers... ...where I was also the leader of the procession. My head's full of contradictions. Mine's full of fruit trees, laughter and children. Would you read my letter? Lise, I'm an old bachelor... ...stuck between Augustin here, and Aristotle... ...between herbal teas and cantatas. And I have grave fears as to whether... ...my philosophy would fit with your dynamic approach. Believe me, we're like the carp and the rabbit. You know how you'll end up, old boy... ...with a cap, a shawl and a heater. Cheers, Augustin! - Can we go, now? - Yes. That's it... It's fixed. It wouldn't take being smashed open again. Thank you, Mr Charmille. Oh, Mr Charmille... Take a look at this. Look at that tap there. I think it's leaking a bit. It's the joint... or could be the thread. If it's the thread, it's not funny. I wasn't laughing at that. I don't really appeal to you... or do I? My dear girl... I learned a long time ago... ...to be happy with what was within my reach. Mr Charmille... You weren't always alone? Is that picture on your chimney of Mrs Charmille? A beautiful woman! Yes, we were like the fable of the carp and the rabbit. Mrs Charmille was a fine strapping girl... ...with big sad eyes. I ran after her for 4 years, before we settled in Rue Frémicourt. She stayed a fortnight. She left? She think she was too well educated for me. What is it now? This. - That's me! - Yes. Where did you find it? - On Rombard's body. - Really? When you lend people photos, you never get them back. It needs a new joint. I'll have to replace the pipe. - Are you a plumber? - Yes. There's a leak in my mother's kitchen. - Where? - In the 13th district. I'd say Saturday, but I can't promise. While I'm there, I'll give you my sister's traffic fines to fix... ...because I don't have a licence, but my sister does. When I think of Maurice... It's just one thing after another! I agree. Is your taste in parliamentarians, something you planned yourself? No... it's hereditary. Excuse me? Yes. Mum ran the members bar in parliament... ...during the fifties. I've jumped on the knees of Presidents of the Council. Various deputies... particularly radicals... ...I don't know why... ...were very friendly with mum, and bringing me presents. And then I grew up. - And the game went on. - Well... But there are 400 deputies. You're not going to tell me... Oh no! My vote doesn't go to everyone! It's restricted to... Wait... It's simple... This is my little directory. Come and sit here. So wait and see... There was this one... There was that one... and there are more... And then him! Him, here?! That can't be true! Yes. I knew that one would amaze you. Oh! Poor Norbert... I remember when he set me up here. - He said: "It's quiet here." - That's true. Is that a factory over there? Yes, but it's been closed for years. There him, but it won't last, because he's silly... And then, there's him. I'll tell you some other time, because... And him. Do you know the guy? Having emerged victorious from a sordid political plot... ...I declare myself ready to support the government... ...against all forms of terrorism! These assassins... ...will not get away with it! This sitting is adjourned. An extraordinary sitting in parliament... A sitting filled with fear. 3 deputies assassinated in 3 days. Our deputies are understandably fearful. Feeling more confident in their local police... than in the headquarters police here... some representatives of the people have returned... ...to take refuge in their constituencies. There was talk of dismissal of headquarters staff... on the subject of which "sclerosis" and "incapacity "... ...were the most polite terms we heard in the Chamber. Where's Tanquerelle? Maybe on the trail of the assassin. Gentlemen, the presentation of my award is now postponed indefinitely. You can wrap it up. Look at this, boss. Grand prize for coachwork. Yesterday at Vittel, The Leopard of Honour". The 1st prize was awarded unanimously to the Delage coupé. Coachwork by Clipardi. And this one. Concours d'Elegance at La Baule... Triumph for comedienne Eva Sanders... "who showed a Talbot Spider, coachwork by Clipardi." I'll make enlargements. Clipardi... Look at the little leopard. And there... and there... Clipardi. Clipardi... Where have I seen that...? Clip... That's it! I'm not disturbing you? May I...? - Hello, Mr Charmille. - Hello. - How do I get to that? - Where? There... into that factory. You have to go through the underpass. - There's no shorter way? - I don't know. Nobody ever goes there. It's falling apart. And I only look after here... not there. I guard here... Not there. Madam! You're wanted on the phone! In my room! I'm coming. Hello... yes, I'll wait. Hello... boss? It's me, Guérin. Marcel, do you have anything new? We've got something here. Here too. It's just come from the minister. You've been taken off the case. It'll be... It'll be handled by Beretti. What?! - What is it? - Terrible. Have you made arrangements? - My things. - What do you mean? Here's my ID, my pass, my gun... ...my beeper and my letter of resignation. "Resignation"? Nobody resigns, with a record like yours. Remember the Hay-les-Roses strangler... ...the drugstore arsonist... Your career's been mapped out side by side with me. - We're the same. - No!... I've got self-respect... If I'm taken off a case, I bow out. And to give it to Beretti... That's real humiliation! Come on now! Tanquerelle! I've just had to uninvite 100 people... after paying 4000 francs for pot plants... ...macaroons and pastries... and you talk about humiliation! - Shall I tell you what I think? - No. If you're going to call me a worm... I'll talk about your hair-do. You preferred it as it was? I don't know any longer... I'm at the end of my tether. Take this as a souvenir. Goodbye, boss. Tell Beretti, the file on the awls... ...is in the 3rd drawer on the right. It's been a long time since you picked me up. Now I'll be coming every day. - Something wrong? - No, why? Come on, hop in. Tomorrow, my girls, we're going to have a big spring-clean. I don't wish to criticize... ...but this house is disgusting. - Where's the corkscrew? - In the sideboard. Are we going to have your daughter on our backs 24 hours a day? It's the street door... I'll go. No... I'll go!... I'll go! A letter from Honfleur. - Maybe it will rescue us! - Lise! - Yes. - A letter from Honfleur! What number's your room? Number 8. I'm not the daughter of a couple of riffraff. Mum was in high fashion... and I grew up in taffetas and organdie. I stuttered "Rosa the Rose". I strummed sonatas. Everything led me to become honest. This'd please you, wouldn't it? "Justice in pursuit of crime." Let me see... Yes, there's a resemblance! Reading led me astray. I was crazy about detective stories. I saw myself stalking Fantômas and Belphegor... and arresting Jack the Ripper in Whitechapel... ...or Dr Fu-Manchu in Hong Kong. I wandered through tropical mists... ...picking the roses of Gambais, the orchids of Miss Blandish... ...and the lupins of Arsène. I breezed through the police academy examination. All of that, my love, to reply to your question... "How does one become a cop?" Your vocation may have come from a taste for beating people up. I can very well see you applying a blowtorch... ...to the testicles of a protester. - Cops don't live a life of austerity. - Aha! - There are the odd distractions. - That's good. "As for my belief," said Inspector Beretti... "It can only be a suicide operation, "by the last of the OAS fanatics." - I see they're making progress. - Yes... Beretti speaks with conviction. "It goes without saying that the protection of our parliamentarians is ensured..." which would have happened had I been listened to... from the 1st murder." Who's that aimed at, do you think. Sit up! I used to think you were all one big happy family. Beretti... in MY family?! He's the most disgusting guy I know. He's tried it on with me, 20 times. 20 times? It's all he thinks about. There are people like that. Lend me your glasses. Just make sure I get them back. Here, look at this and compare them. What do you know! It's the same girl! - Concentrate on the building... - Yeah... - Looking at the building? - I am. The window down the bottom. It's closed here in the paper, and open in that photo. It certainly is! What's it mean? Nobody's gone in there for years. It's an incredible dump. But somebody had to open the window. Could it have been the murderer, Inspector?! Put it on. Enlarge this bit here. More. More here... just here. What are the 2 circles there? Binoculars in the sun. Binoculars! - Do you have a phone? - No, ma'am. Binoculars! We've got the killer! - Where's the post office? - Over there. If I understand correctly, we'll have lunch later? Give me Beretti. - His office isn't answering. - Give me Verdier. At this time? He's got his billiards. How are things with you? Would you get me Danton 10-20. Take both out of this. I don't have any change. I'm sorry, but it's urgent! So get some change. I'm police! - What are you doing? - Oh! Mr Lemercier! When did you get here? I arrived 2 days ago, on the 1.54. I brought the bird. The beautiful Augustin! Well, what do you know! "Good morning..." "Mrs Melun!" You might ask her if she would get me my phone call! Is this lady a friend of yours? Danton 10-20 you said? Right away. Francis. Call for you. He's not here. He was going to come, but he's gone up to Saint-Cloud. That frisky bimbo! Christine? This is Tanquerelle. Is Inspector Beretti there? Not yet. I'm expecting him. He's to question me. Can you take the phone over to the window? Which window? The one that look across to the factory at the back. Wait, I'll see. Just makes it. Good... Look down at the Clipardi building. At the bottom of it... Is the window open or closed? Closed... it's always closed. No... not always. It opens when you receive your beloved relatives. A Peeping Tom? I think that would describe him. When Beretti arrives, tell him... Don't tell him anything... I'll call back. Like a radish? Where are we going? Where are we going? Would you get it filled up? I need to call the little girl. A line please... thanks. Hello... it's me. Is Beretti there? - No, he's still not here. - I'll call back. How silly... Someone was just phoning for you. - Who was that, my love? - Your colleague. Tanquerelle. What did she want? She's going to call you back. - Really? Where's your phone? - There. You wouldn't have anything cold, white... ...and sparkling, would you? I'll make use of your phone call... ...to order us a bite to eat. Fine! A token! 2 fried eggs, please. After, I feel like something sweet. A coffee liégeois? Guérin, get yourself over to Saint-Cloud... with the works! And do what? Wait for me.. Pick up my badge and my gun. - A token please. - Your eggs are coming. - How's the chitterling sausage? - A token! Not bad! You think so? I'd like some. I was talking about the sausage. That's cute... where's it from? Got it from a friend in Dallas. How much? - All of it? - All of it. 2 tokens, 2 eggs, 1 coffee liégeois... Here... keep the change... Come on! Shouldn't I close the curtains? - Why? Are you scared someone can see? - Exactly... Tanquerelle said that behind a window... ...there was someone who liked to watch. - Did she say which window? - Yes. Oh! Damn... it's open. Do you remember if Tanquerelle said anything else? She said not to say anything to you. Don't you worry, my pet. Are you sure you don't want me to come with you? No... wait for me here in the restaurant. - What shall I get for you? - Whatever you're having. You don't want to eat before making the arrest? Well, let's see now... Hello, Mrs Tanquerelle. Has Beretti been here? - Yes. He's left. - Where to? - Down there to the factory. - Oh my God! Hey... Mrs Tanquerelle... You were right about the window. Beretti? Beretti? Boss! Lise! I'm here! Through here! Stand back. Don't shoot! Come with me! Come on!... Now! For God's sake! Don't move... Don't move! Move the bikes! Stand back! Get in! Behind the wheel! I have to warn you that I don't drive very well. I can't drive at all. - What'll we do? - I want him alive. And especially the hostage. After them! - Why don't you go faster? - We're going fast as it is. What an exciting chase! What else can we do? Don't forget he's armed. You have to go faster... or else! It's so annoying being followed like this! - Can't you get it out of second? - No. Just try! Where are they? Didn't anyone see? No, nothing at all. Do you want to go back into the city? - Go through Porte de Châtillon. - Why? Because we're going to Spain. What are you doing? If you have to go to Spain... ...I need to grab a bite to eat first. I'd love to take you to Spain. I was planning to go back there, anyhow. But I've now skipped 2 meals, because of your stupidity... ...and that has impacted on my private life... ...for reasons it would be inappropriate to discuss. I'm not going to Spain on an empty stomach. Get back in the car right away! Pick them up! Go on! I'm just impossible, when I'm hungry! Urgent implementation of "Plan Paris". No sign yet of the suspect vehicle. Then we simply have to activate "Plan Balthazar". Cover all airports and stations. - Are you sure you don't want anything? - No! So Christine was just 7 or 8 when you knew her? She was a sweet innocent child. She was still living with the old madam at the time. - You were already neighbours? - I was already caretaker. All the bigwigs came up there... ...even a President of the Council. At night, I'd make her dinner and put her to bed. I put a bed in my caretaker-room. So all-in-all, they were good times? You were a sort of father to her. She was such a child, I tell you. Give me the mike. This is Picot. I've just located the car. The 2 men are in a bistro at Saint-Médard. They're having a snack. What should I do? Just keep your eye on them, that's all. It's getting light. I just wonder who's going to look after her now. What do you do for a living? - I'm a professor. - Of what? The trumpet. I would've loved to have been a professor of Greek or Latin... ...a real prestige job, that would be! Professor of Greek, policeman... or suburban vigilante... They're all just roles... The masks are interchangeable. I could be in your place, and you in mine. I'd wave a pistol around, and you'd wear the mask of the wisdom. You'd say to me: "Mr Lemercier... "you should give yourself up to the police... "It would be taken into account." I might not necessarily believe you... ...but I'd realise that I'm pretty tired... ...and that Spain, after all, is a long way away. Do you know of a police station around here? That's not where you'd want to go! How about police headquarters? That'd really please the inspector... She's worked so hard on this. Yes, you're right. He must've shot the hostage. How come he's so calm about it?! So now WE start shooting? Well, I won't. Let's just wait, boss... Calm down! It was probably accidental... The gun might've gone off by itself. But that killer's gone off with Antoine! I'll get him back. Tomorrow he'll be home. I'll beat that other one to a pulp! The law says we're supposed to bring murderers in! It doesn't specify in how many pieces! Boy, she's annoying! Guérin... you can't have everything... To do her job, she has to be a pain in the neck every day. The Renault R5 has just left Rue Etienne Marcel. Crossing Pont au Change. At the top of Rue Saint-Jacques. Rue Berthollet. It's turning towards Rue Bernard. But it's crazy Lise... Police, police. Good grief! That's done it! - What? - My knee again! Broken, I'd say... Probably shattered this time. Just lean on me. The same thing all over again! Obviously something you like doing!
