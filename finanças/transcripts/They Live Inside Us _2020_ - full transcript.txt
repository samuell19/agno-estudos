[crow cawing] [eerie music] [music continues] - [dog barking] - [car buzzing] [music continues] [thunder rumbles faintly] Why'd you stop? It's the Booth House. [ominous music] You know, a family used to live here a while back, right? Yeah, I heard they went missing. Because of the curse. What curse? A witch used to live here, man. Now this place is cursed. Wait, you haven't heard about this? Well, she and her daughter lived here when this place was first built. When her daughter died, she was blamed for it. They say, she locked herself in the basement, and eventually, she killed herself. [grunts] Dude, no. That's not even close to what I heard. I heard the guy who used to live here, Mr. Booth, was a monster. He went crazy, killed his whole family, and then shot himself. Yeah, but what about the bodies? The bodies were never found. They say, he hid the bodies somewhere inside the house, that's why their ghosts are stuck here. I guess no one really knows, then. Yeah. Dude, it's late. We should go. [bicycle thumps in the ground] Where are you going? [door squeaks] Dude, what are you doing? [thunder rumbling] [ominous music] What is wrong with you? Why you're always such a wuss? You always say you want to do something scary, but only when it's made up. - Shut up. - Gosh... Dude, up there! What? [thunder rumbles loudly] [boy] Let's get out of here! [ominous music] [thunder clashing] [man] Every house has a story. A story that lives inside it, like a memory in a brain. The characters of these stories are the ghosts of the people who once inhabited these places. Who lived out their narratives only to forget and be forgotten by the passage of time. But in some places, these stories are never quite finished, leaving the spirits to wander aimlessly like a spinning wheel. And I think... that's what's been going on at the Booth House for the last 30 years. The horrors that happened to the missing family have been buried here, hidden in the darkness behind closed doors. I think there's a story here, waiting to be told. And that's why I'm here. [man laughs on the radio] Welcome back! You're listening to 94.9, Witching Season Radio! Midnight is here, you know what that means? Halloween is officially upon us! The veil is thin and the world of the dead and living are almost interchangeable. To celebrate, stick with me as we broadcast for the next 24 hours. [eerie music] [door squeaks] Hello? [floor creaks] I'm here at the, the Booth House. This place is exactly as I pictured it would be. Doesn't look like anyone is here. Everything is covered in sheets. [thunder rumbles loudly] [gasps] [turns off the recorder] [bell rings] It's a locked door. Maybe it leads to the basement? [turns off the recorder] [floor creaking] Hello? [water dropping] [door squeaks] - [thud on the table] - Jesus. [tense music] I found the study. And a really nice writing desk. And of course I already broke something so, there's that. [screams] - God, Dani! - Dad! What's your problem? I thought you were asleep. - You alright? - Yeah, I'm okay. What the hell? Watch your mouth. You say it all the time. So I thought someone was meeting us here? You know, uh... you don't even worry about it, we're good to go. Where the hell is the thermostat? [imitating] Watch your mouth. So what's in there? Oh, uh, ghosts. There're ghosts? No. They're the friendly ghosts, okay? So, so, they're like the... what's that dumb... like, they're like the Casper, they're, they're friendly, they're not going to, they're not going to... There's no ghosts, alright? I'm... So... I was... it was just a... God, damn it. Wow. Looks like the one Grandma and Grandpa gave us. [turns on record player] ["The Chinese Dance, The Nutcracker Suit" plays] Dad. No. Stop it! [hums the music] [grunts] [news reporter] When that school bell rings tomorrow at 2:30, - officially Halloween has begun. - Alright, here we go. This year, with Halloween landing... I don't want to watch TV. - ...officials have urged... - Why? They always have the best stuff on in October. - ...children. This is... - [man] Hey folks, come on down to McKade's Pumpkin Patch and Corn Maze! There's still plenty of time to pick up your Halloween Jack O'Lantern! And, of course, if you stay after dark, the corn maze becomes the "Haunted Corn Maze." [suspenseful music plays on TV] [Count Spookula] Hey, where do you want me to come out from? - Uh, just... - They super glued the coffin lid up. Just the curtain and the coffin right... See? - [Count Spookula] Here? - [producer] No, no, no, other side of the coffin. [Count Spookula] Yeah, but, I'll knock shit over if I come out here. - No, the right... Your right side of the coffin. - Oh, here? - [producer] Yes. - Okay, got it. - This is lame. - Welcome everyone to "Count Spookula's Horrific... - It's not lame, it's Spookula. - ...Spookula... - ...be your host tonight... - He is lame. ...and take you through a journey... Ah, come on, he is great. I, I grew up watching this, okay? - Me and your mo... - We've got professional, we've got semi-professional, - and we've got... - It's Spookula. It's, it's not bad. ...Todd made last week. [producer] Okay, Count, just, just stick to the script, okay? - What are we doing here? - [Count Spookula] You told me to promote local films, - I'm promoting local films. - [producer] Yeah, but... Todd worked his ass off! Came for work, sweetie. You know that. But why here? In this house. You know, sometimes it's... Sometimes it's hard for... for people to... for me, to be creative. And I guess that's everyone, it's hard, it's hard for anyone to be creative... after something bad has happened. I find that, uh... that sometimes a change of scenery, uh... doing something new, can help. And I guess I figured that it would be good for me. I mean... good for us. With everything that's going on. Sweetheart, I know that... I know this isn't what you want. Maybe when we're done though, I... we can go camping or something? Really? Yeah. Go up to the lake? - Yes! - Yeah? Okay. Done. Are you okay here for a minute? I got to make a phone call. - Mm-hmm. - Okay, I'll be back, alright? There you go. [phone ringing] [beep] Yeah, hi. Uh, it's me, um... I just wanted to let you know I'm here. Uh, we... [man on TV] Welcome back, boils and ghouls, to the channel 33, - Halloween Spookathon! - So we just came in... - [man laughing on TV] - ...and I hope that's fine. I, I didn't know what else to do, so... Um. Yeah, if we see you... great, uh, but, yeah, just figured I'd let you know we're here. So... Yeah. [Count Spookula] First up tonight on our chopping block: Drill Massacre 4. This is the fourth film in a series. I think there's one or two that came before it, I don't know, I haven't seen them. [eerie music plays on TV] [gasps] [suspenseful music] [knocks on the door] [rain falls] [thunder rumbles] [knocks on the door] [tense music] [door squeaks] [door bangs shut] Who's there? [floor creaking] [ominous music] [water runs in the bathroom] [water stops running] [struggles under the water] [struggle stops] ["The Chinese Dance, The Nutcracker Suit" plays] [woman] You found her. What? - [music continues] - [tense music overlaps] Cynthia? Isn't she beautiful? Wha... what are you doing here? I've always been here. You're not real. I know you're stuck. I jus... just don't have anything left. Don't have any ideas, any... inspiration, anything. I'm, I'm just going in a circle. I'm so sorry. Sorry I was always gone. I should've been there for you. And I know I wasn't. Please. Please don't go. Please, please, please, please stay. I can't stay. - I can't. - Why? But I can help you. What? I know what you're looking for. It's in this house. What? What's in this house? [tense music increases] Keep looking. You'll find it. It's right in front of you. [woman on TV] Hello? My car broke down and I have a party to get to, so, I was wondering if you could maybe help me? Hello? Hello! [thunder rumbles loudly] [light suspenseful music] - [music stops] - [keyboard clicking] [whispering] She looks down and realizes her daughter is gone. [light suspenseful music] [panting] - [music stops] - Something is watching her. [sinister calm music] [whispering] Masked killer. [light suspenseful music] [music increases] [knocks on the door] [woman] Please! Please, help me! [news reporter] ...of a Halloween mask. Uh, the local authorities... [woman] Oh, God, please, he is coming! ...to please remain inside your homes... - [man snores] - [woman] Oh, my God, please! ...suspicious activities or sightings during this incredibly dangerous situation. - There is a killer on the loose. - [woman bangs on the door] Oh, please! Please! [music fades] [breathing heavily] [tense music] [woman screams on TV] Please, don't kill me. I, I don't want to die. Don't do that. [man laughs] [woman screams] [man laughs] [chuckles] [man laughs] [light suspenseful music] [woman pants] [killer] Knife to meet you. [music increases] - [woman gasps] - [flesh tearing] It's a fucking shit! [floor creaking] [ominous music] [Dani] Dad. Dad! - [knocking on the table] - Dad! Oh, shit! Ahh! Can we go trick or treating tonight? Dani, I didn't get any sleep last night, and I didn't get any work done. Probably not, no. Mom always took me trick or treating. Mom is not here! I'm sorry. Dani, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry. I love you and... I'm doing the best that I can. Okay, look. I have a lot of work to get done still, okay? But, let me get through that, and let's see if we can find something that might work as a costume. - Really? - Yeah. Again, it's going to take me a little bit, I got to play catchup, but, just... find something and we'll, we'll go. [loud ominous sound] [soft suspenseful music] [chuckles] [whispering] Scarecrow.

I ca... I have to focus on other things sometimes, and I'm sorry I got distracted. You don't care about me. I don't even care about you? Really? What do I spend my days doing Dani? Huh? I spend my days carrying you from one spot to another, cooking for you, feeding you. Do you realize that you're not the only one who lost her? Like, does that even occur to you? That maybe you're the reason she's gone. And now I'm the one who gets to carry you around, I'm the one who gets to clean you and dress you, and take care of you all day! [crying] I'm sorry. [whispering] No. I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. This is me. This is on me. Not you. The shortcomings we have as a family are not your fault. It's my failure as your dad. All of this was... just me trying and, like usually, I couldn't do it right. Okay? I love you, Dani, so much and I'm, I'm sorry for... for what I put you through. This place... it's not good for us.

Does this feel like a dream? This can't be real. None of this, it can't be real, it just... How do I wake up? This is still your story. You've got to finish what you've started. There is no story. I lost her. I can't get out, I don't know how to get out. I don't know where to go. [whispering] I lost Dani. I lost Dani. I don't know, I've looked everywhere. What happened here? [soft eerie music] [light heartbeat sound] [door squeaks] [soft moans] [murmuring indistinctly] [soft snarls] [clown] Welcome back. What did you say? [snarling] She's not here. [clown giggles] - Who? - Who you think? Little one, the girl, Dani. How do you know her name? Do you ever get tired of doing the same thing over and over and over? - Where is she? - [clown laughs] - She took her. - Who? Who took her? The bitch from your story. The one who always gets away over again. Where are they? [clown laughs] That's, that's pretty funny. Where? [snarls] Well... I guess it's time for you to die again.

Now, now you're free. [thunder rumbles] No. No, don't, don't be upset. No, I did this for us. Oh, it's okay. No, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

Hello? They're both dead. Who is dead, sir? Yes, they're, they're both dead. I... Okay, sir. I'm going to need you to answer some questions. Can you start from the beginning? The beginning? I was away. For work, on a trip. Try... trying to... trying to finish my story. I left Dani alone with Cynthia. I should... should've, should've been there. Sho... should've... Shou... should've been there for both of them. When I came home... I found Dani dead. Cynthia drowned her in the tub. [whispering] Cynthia... So I came down the downstairs... and I stabbed her to death. [whispering] I just stabbed her...
