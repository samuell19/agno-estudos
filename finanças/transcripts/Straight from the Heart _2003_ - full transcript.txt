- How long are we gonna keep herding these mustangs back into the valley? - Until they take it as home and stay put. And I can get a rope around that stallion. - Tyler, he's just a horse. - He's special. - Special trouble, that's what he is. - Jesse Syms, you are getting cranky in your old age. Or lazy. - Ain't got a lazy bone in my body, Tyler Ross! - Must be cranky, then. Giddyup. - Ms. Donovan, Mr. Costa is ready to see you now. - I think that these pictures will make people think about the environment, perhaps even the future of the planet. Ms. Donovan... Do you... love garbage? - I... I beg your pardon? - A great photographer actually reveals aspects of himself that he's unaware of. Did you see some... truth about yourself in this... garbage? Um... - Happy birthday, Jordan! So, how'd it go at the gallery? - Pbbth. - What does he know, anyway? - He knows garbage when he sees it. Maybe I'm just fooling myself. Oh! I've been doing this forever. Maybe I should just give up and go back to wall street. - What? No. No, no, no, no, no. See, that's why you're gonna make it, because you never give up. Even when you should, like with Edward, who's kept you hanging forever. - Okay, you have to stop that, because it's my birthday. - I'm just saying, you've been together for five years. You don't even live together. I mean, wake up and smell the decaf mocha latte. - Edward has territorial issues, right, Hubert? - He takes you for granted, and you don't give him any reason not to. It's like you got "doormat" tattooed on your forehead. - For your information, miss negative, I think that he's gonna propose to me tonight, okay? - Really? - Yes. - Did he say something? - His exact words were, "I want to talk about our relationship." So there. - Okay. Well, you know, let's hope that he comes through. On with the celebration. Toast. Grab your glass. - Mm. To my best friend... - Yes. - On the occasion of your official descent into spinsterhood. - Spinsterhood? That's so rude. You're over 30, sweetie. - You better answer it. It could be someone trying to tell you you won the lottery. - Yeah. Tyler here. - Tyler Franklin Ross, you went after that stupid horse again, didn't you? Morning to you, too, sis. - Listen. You got another letter from country connection. This one's from New York City, of all places. It's a shame she's so far away. She sounds real nice. - Great. - Remember our deal. - Yeah, I remember, Laurie. You just remember your end of it, all right? Good-bye. - "Country connections the magazine for rural singles"? What is this? - This is great, okay? It's mostly men, unlike New York, where straight, single men are an endangered species, and they want to get married. - "Have 10,000 acres of wheat. Looking for marriage-minded gal who can keep house, cook, And drive a tractor. Must look good in jeans." Well, that's me. - There. Read the ad I marked. - "Wyoming cattleman, 35, been to college..." well, that's a good thing... "marriage and children inclined. "I'm not perfect, and I'm not looking for someone who is. Tyler Ross." A...and this concerns me, how? - I answered his ad in your name. - Carla! - You... this is good. He sent a plane ticket. - Carla, you know, of all the crazy, stupid, ridiculous, mean, insane... what'd you say about me, anyway? - Uh, I said that you're warm, and you're funny, and you're very sincere. - But I have a terrific guy. - You know what? He needs a nudge. Okay? A man never wants a woman more than when another man wants her. So I got you another man. - I'm not gonna use some poor schmuck of a cowboy to make Edward jealous. It's playing games, and I don't do that, Carla. - Look, just go out west, okay? Enjoy your trip. Take a camera. Maybe they got better garbage out there. Come in, Edward! - Hmm? Hi, sweetheart. - How's the birthday girl? - Fine. Carla. - Edward. How are ya? Okay, I'm going to, um... Let you two get on with the big celebration. - Thank you. - Have fun. - Thanks, baby. - I got something for you. - Yeah? - Yes. A very special gift. - Very special? - Very special. I thought... If we're going to be living in my apartment, you should have a key. Yeah. So, you...you're... you're asking me to... - Move in with me. And? - And live together. I thought this would be the perfect time to take our relationship to the next level. I mean, it's just... just your birthday is just, uh... This is the anniversary of the luckiest night of my life. The night we met. - Yeah. Five years ago. Five years ago. Wow, I wonder where we're gonna be in another five years. - We'll be together. - Together. Hmm. Together... single, together married? - Oh, Jordan. This is a very real commitment that I'm making, asking you to move in with me. - Okay, Edward, it's just that when I imagined this moment, I expected you to say, "will you be my wife?" Not "roommate." - I mean, this is a solid offer. - An offer. An offer, really? How long is this offer good for? Until you find somebody better? Until you get bored? If something goes wrong between the two of us, who has to go out and find a new place, you or me? - Well, it is my apartment. - Exactly. Your home. Yours. Not ours. - Hey, nobody can promise forever and be sure they're gonna live up to it. - Really? Well, you know what? That's exactly what one of these guys is prepared to do. And he wants to meet me. You expect me to believe that you want to meet him? - Yes. - Well, I'm not gonna play these games with you, Jordan. When you are ready to discuss this like a mature, rational person, then call me. - I can't believe I agreed to do this. How will I even recognize him? - He didn't say. - I can just imagine what Tyler Ross is gonna look like... overalls, a beer belly, and one of those funny cowboy hats. - Miss Donovan? - Tyler Ross? I, uh... - I'll get your bag. Okay. Thank you. Okay. I've got to admit, I feel really awkward. I'll bet you probably do too, huh? I'll bet everyone who does this sort of thing feels the same way, right? - I wouldn't know. - I'll take that. I'll take that, thank you. - We got a ways to go. - When do we get to town? - We're there. - This country is breathtaking. Constable would have loved it. - He was a...an English painter. - You don't say. - Yeah, late 18th, early 19th century. He painted... - landscapes. A little dark for my taste. - It's gonna be just like a Danielle steel novel. That's okay, I'll get it. Thank... thank you. Thanks. - Uh, Jordan Donovan, this is my sister, Laurie, and, uh, Jesse. Jesse, what are you doing here? - Just lookin'. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. - Ma'am. - Tyler, why is she carrying her own bag? - I offered, but she wanted to do it herself. - It's fine, I'm fine. - Listen, I'll show you to the spare room. Get about a half hour, and then we'll have some dinner. - Okay. - Jesse, I'll help you feed, huh? - Nice to meet you, Jordan. - Nice to meet you. - Well, she sure seemed like a nice enough gal. - If you say so. - So... you're a photographer? - Um... yeah. - Ever photograph weddings? - Uh, no. - Oh. See, 'cause I'm getting married in a few days, and the photographer that I hired has come down with the measles, can you believe it? At his age. - Well, it's just, I... I may not be here that long. - I just got my wedding dress. You want to see it? - Sure. - Spare bedroom's over that way. Make yourself at home. - Okay. That's a... that's an original Thomas Kinkade. - Yes, it is. So, I was going to go for something a little less formal, but then I saw this, and, oh... You know how it is. - Oh, it's... it's lovely. - Really? - Yeah. - I don't have much of a fashion sense. My idea of getting dressed up is putting on a clean pair of jeans. - Oh. I'm sure you'll be beautiful. - I'm dying to ask you, what do you think of Tyler? - You know, I can honestly say that I've never met anyone like him. - So, is this your first trip out west, miss Donovan? - Actually, it is, Chuck. And, please, call me Jordan. - Jordan. - Why don't you tell us all about New York? - Would you pass the salt? Thank you. - Um... I'm sure it wouldn't be very interesting. - Oh, come on. All the museums and the restaurants? - Well, my favorite little place to hang out is a cafe called la xunta basque on 52nd street. Um, Jackie Onassis and her sister Lee used to speak French to each other when they ate dinner. It was very cool. - Ah. - Jordan's a photographer. - Oh. Chuck just had his, uh, picture taken at sears last week. Didn't you? - Yes, sir, I did. - I'm actually a fine arts photographer. I just had a meeting with one of the top galleries in New York to talk about having a show. - What kind of pictures do you take? - Um, uh, refuse. - You... you mean garbage? - I'm sure they're real nice pictures. - Well, I wouldn't exactly call them nice. No. Significant, yes. There's a great deal of subtext to garbage, I think. The New York art world must be a bunch of idiots. - Anyone want some pie? Hello? - Oh, contact with sanity. - Jordan, hey! - Does Hubert miss me? - You got to stop worrying about that fish, okay? Where are you? - This ranch, out in the middle of nowhere. This is so much worse than I expected. - He's ugly. I knew it. You know, I... I should have realized that when he didn't have a picture with his ad. - Well... He's not exactly unattractive. But I have no idea why he asked me to come. He clearly does not want me here. - You're not giving her a chance, Ty. - I said I'd meet her. I never said I'd like her. - Oh, how can you write her off so quickly? You don't know anything about her. - I know she likes dropping names of people she doesn't even know. I can see her fitting in here, huh, Chuck? Course, you wouldn't have anyone to talk French to. - She's nervous. And your attitude isn't helping any. If you want a chance at something wonderful... - wonderful. Trouble is more like it. - Jordan, I...I'm so sorry I got you into this. Why don't you just tell him that, I don't know, something came up and you got to come back right away? - Well, I'm thinking about it. It's just the other people that I met here, like his sister, are really nice. I feel awful lying to them. - Sweetie, it's so easy to lie. Just pretend you're me. Hi. Mind if I join you? Thanks. Wow, I've never seen so many stars in my life. It's beautiful. - Yeah. Just a lonesome coyote. No need to be afraid. I'm not afraid. - Does living in New York City make people so touchy? - Possibly. What's your excuse? Just comes natural, I guess. - I'm sure there's a lot of things out here that I'm not used to. - You east coasters are funny people. You think the world is flat... you go west of Philadelphia, you'll fall off the edge of it. You know, has it ever occurred to you that you might be wrong about some things? Possibly? - Nope. No, no. Of course not. Oh, you're just yanking my chain. - Little bit, yeah. Course, there's no sport in it. You're too easy. - Really? So, you got me all figured out. Huh. Well, lay it on me. Tell me exactly who you think I am. Seriously, go ahead. - You got somebody else's name plastered on the back of your jeans. You're probably one of those politically-correct people who never had a true thought of your own. - And your mind's as closed as a steel trap. Can't tolerate anything or anyone outside your narrow little world out here. Decided I was a shallow snob the second you laid eyes on me, huh? - About the same time you decided I was a dumb hick. - Well, I guess we know where we stand with each other, huh? - I guess so. - As far as me having somebody's name on my back, didn't realize your last name was wrangler. - You know, I...I'm just gonna have some coffee and toast, I think. - We don't have any of that, uh, Espresso or cappuccino around here. - We're vaccinating the cattle today. You can come along, if you like. - Laurie. - Sounds fascinating. I'd love to. - You may have to ride a horse. - It's no problem. I can stay on a horse. - Let him go. - All right, that's the last of 'em. - I told you, Jordan, the cattle get a little, uh, gamey once you get up close and personal. - Oh, it's all right. Nothing's gamier than garbage. - Hey, Ty! Why don't you show Jordan some of your, uh, rope tricks later on? - I don't think she'd be interested. - Sure she would. Come on. - That's okay, Laurie, really. You know, no one likes to perform on command. - Have a nice ride! - Bye! - You know, you didn't have to let Laurie talk you into this. - Long ride. - Well, I can handle it. - You know how to bridle a horse? - Yeah, of course I do. Oh! Okay. Okay, the horse is head-shy. Yeah. He's a little touchy. - You so did that on purpose. You wanted to see me make a fool of myself, didn't you? - Look, lady, you're the one acting like you know everything. Wow. You are having the best time at my expense, aren't you? You acted like a jerk from the second I got here. Well, I tell you what. I've had it. I'm on the first plane right back to New York. - Well, that's where you belong. - You're right, it is. Absolutely. At least I can get Chinese food delivered by taxi. People don't eat 50 pounds of cholesterol for breakfast. Okay, people are a little rude maybe sometimes, but at least they've got a good reason for it, you know, like they've got to shove through 500 people to get through the subway, and then, you...you, my friend... hey! Where... where are you going? You've got to be kidding me. Hey! Can you slow down? Jeez. - Where'd you learn to horseback? I grew up helping my dad at a boarding stable where he worked. - I thought you grew up in New York City. - No, Hainesville. Little town in upstate New York. I'd exercise the horses while the owners were away. - That ain't the city. - No, I didn't go to the city until I went to college. It was great going to a place you'd always dreamed of. It was like going to oz, you know? A whole new world for me. - What was wrong with the world you came from? - Nothing, just looking for more. - Did you find it? - Of course. - Wild horse gather. They thin out the herds, to be sold at a public sale. - You know those guys? - Hank Jamison, head of the stockmen's association, with some dlm wranglers. - Department of land management? - They're supposed to manage open range. Today, they're managing my land. - So they're trespassing. - Yep. Well... Ho! - Whoa. Hey, could we slow down, please? - You might want to stop the up-and-down stuff. It'd be easier on your behind. - Why didn't you go down and confront those guys? - Well, it's a personal matter. - And they took those beautiful horses, you know? - I know where to find them. - Obviously meant to be free out here. - There's nothing more beautiful on this earth than a herd of mustang moving across open land. - Why exactly do they thin the herds? - Well, they say it's to protect the open range, but the truth is, a lot of ranches don't want their cattle sharing grazing land. - What's gonna happen to 'em? - Nothin'... If I have anything to say about it. - W... would you stop riding away from me? Gosh! Oh, my gosh. What happened? - Wild horseman has been at work. - Hello, baby. Hello, baby. - Will he survive? - We'll take it back to the barn. - I don't know about this. - Now, what most people don't understand is that goat milk is the universal donor. - Do I look like someone who's ever milked a goat before? - Just pat the udder. Start from the top like you're getting milk out of a balloon. You'll be fine. She could starve without it. - Hi. Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. Good girl. Oh! I got it. I got it! Oh! Uh. - Don't be too rough. - I can be gentle. - Good. - Pete was a long-legged, crooked-grinned, tumbleweed type of guy who could charm a bear out of honey and a girl out of her better judgment. - He loved a rodeo. I loved him. He never met a hand of poker or a bottle of JD or a shapely tail feather he didn't like. - Any fool could see where that marriage was headed. We got a divorce along about the time Sarah died. - Who's Sarah? - Tyler's wife. He didn't tell you? - Mm. - No, I guess he wouldn't. - Well, how did she die? - Tyler'd have a fit if he knew I was telling you this. - Oh, I'm sorry. I don't... I don't mean to pry or anything. - Sarah wanted to be a mom and have Tyler's child more than anything in the world, but she was a high-risk pregnancy. - What happened? - She went into labor when she was seven months along and, um... It all went wrong. - I'm sorry. Tyler must have been devastated. - Ugh. Around here, men are taught to cowboy up. If it hurts, don't show it. - I guess I'm a little bit different than Sarah, huh? - In some ways. But you're more alike than you think. You stand up to Tyler like Sarah did, and... He won't admit it, but he admires that. - You know, there's something that I... I really don't understand, Laurie. Tyler doesn't seem to want me here, so... Why did he ask me to come? I'm gonna level with you, Jordan. Tyler didn't write that ad. I did. When he found out about it, he was mad. Well, then, why did he go along with it? - He was tired of me bugging him, trying to set him up, and we made a deal that if he met one woman, I'd quit trying to play matchmaker. I'm sorry. I hope you don't think we've got you here under false pretenses. - Oh, gosh, it's okay. I understand. - What exactly did you mean by wild horse management? - Bureaucracy at work. Wild horses put up for adoption. Truth is, they only take the younger, more desirable ones. - Leaving the older ones to fend for themselves? - Next hard winter'd take 'em down. All right. I'll be back. - Well, I'm going with you to the sale. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am! - Don't you ever do anything you're told? - Not since I was 12. - Get out. Let's go. - Ha! Ha! Hyah! - A lot of people here. - Yeah. Most of them are here to buy a pet. There are a few over there that like the idea of buying a horse for a few dollars and selling it to a slaughterhouse for 38 cents a pound. - They kill them? - Dog food. Either that, or they end up as the daily lunch special in some fancy European restaurant. - That's disgusting. Is that legal? - Wait here. I got to fill out some forms. Hello, Dave. I'll take that buckskin. - You had no right to take those horses. - Those dang mustangs are a nuisance. In fact, we're gonna do another gather in a couple of days. - Open range is just that. Those horses have a right to be there. - You know, it's too bad you didn't show as much care for some people as you do for those horses. - Just stay off my land. - Are you accusing me of trespassing? - You were on my land, and you know it. - If you have a problem, take it up with the dlm. Some people... - Another gathering coming up. - What's left of the herd is getting easier to handle. - Let's set up a portable. Hold them for a few days, huh? - Hey, Laurie. - Hey. - Listen, have you heard of a rancher named Jamison? - Yeah. Why? - Well, he and Tyler had sort of a, um, well, just... a confrontation at the sale. - Hank Jamison and Tyler have never agreed about the mustangs. - Well, it seemed to be about a little bit more than just horses. - Once upon a time, Hank was a good guy. Now he has a heart cold enough to hang meat. - Why? What happened? - He lost his only daughter. She was all he had. - What does that have to do with Tyler? - Hank blames Ty for her death. His daughter was Sarah. - See, in the wild, it's the dominant mare that actually runs the herd. Young horse gets uppity, she kicks him out for a while. - How does she let him know when his, uh, his time-out is over? - She stops turning him down and turns away. Then he knows he can get back in. That's what Tyler's doing. He's joining up, the way horses is doing the wild. - How's he doin'? - Ty's still got the touch. - I can't believe he's letting Tyler touch him. - He knows Ty's no threat. - Your brother's really good with the horses. - He's a lot better with horses than he is with people. - Whoa, now. Easy, boy. - That's the bareback rig. He's putting it on so the horse will get used to having something on his back and around his belly. - Here we go. Whoa, son. Easy now. - He does it by the numbers, slow and easy. - Well, I've had all the excitement I can take for one afternoon. I'm going to go fix dinner. - Okay. How'd you learn to do that? - Well, I'd seen a lot of horses get their spirits broken. I knew there had to be a better way. Will you put that down, please? - Why don't you like having your picture taken? You afraid I'm gonna see what you're hidin'? - Give me that. - Hey, what are you doing? Wait. Please be careful. - I'm gonna take your picture. What's the matter? Don't you like having your picture taken? - I guess I'm just not used to being on the other side of it. - Okay, smile. - Why'd you start taking pictures? - When I was a kid, my mom thought I was spending too much time alone. She thought the camera would be a good way to encourage me to get off my back and do stuff. - And you took to it right away? - Yeah, I guess. Camera's a good way to connect with the world. At the same time, it was, uh, it was like protection. Helped me deal with what was going on in my life at the time. - What was going on in your life at the time? - Uh... Guess I was having a hard time understanding why one day my father was taking me to the stables to help him out, and the next day, he was gone. - He died? - No. No, he left. And I haven't seen him since. - Any man that don't stick around for his kid ain't worth his salt. If he didn't, there's something wrong with the man, not the kid. Why do you want to take pictures of garbage? - It's the right kind of subject. It's dark, and it's edgy, and it would get me noticed. - So you did it to impress other people. - No offense, but you really don't know how things work. - I understand you don't trust yourself. I understand you need other people to validate your dreams. That can wear a fella down. Um... Laurie, Chuck, I've been doing some thinking, and I'd be happy to do your wedding photos for you, if you'd like. - You would! Oh, Jordan, I can't tell you how much that means to us. - But there's... there's actually something that I should tell you. Um... I'm not exactly a professional photographer. Never really had anything sold or bought, so... - Oh, that doesn't matter. I'm sure you'll do a terrific job. - Great. - I better be goin' soon, hon. I got some stuff to finish up tonight to make up for missing work tomorrow. The game! Oh, my goodness. I nearly forgot about it. - Game? What game? - It's the annual baseball game between the ranchers and the town folk. It's been going on for nearly 100 years. Bigger than the world series for us. No kidding? Sounds fun. - It is if we win. - Send base, Anita! - Oh! - Out! Three away. That hurt. - Ankle? - Yeah. - It'll be okay. - Whew! - Who's that? - That was Anita. - Come on, let's get you up. - I guess everyone here knows each other? Just about. If you're gonna do something you're ashamed of, you'd best be doing it out of town. Well, I've lived in my apartment for seven years. I think I only know one neighbor. Slickers, take the field. Inning's over. - We need you, Laurie. Anita sprained her ankle. - I got a wedding coming up, Jesse. I plan on walking down the aisle with no crutches. Yeah, but you know the rules. Got to have at least one gal on the team. - You're barking up the wrong tree, Jesse. - Uh... can anyone play? - Anybody who lives outside city limits. I guess I qualify, huh? - Chuck, you're leading off. Pete, you're on deck. - Well, you know we have to have a woman playing on the team. - Oh, yeah. She's on the bench. - Then she needs to play. Play ball! - What's up? - She can't just sit on the bench. She's got to play. - Pete, you're on the bench. Jordan, you're on deck. - Oh, man. - If she doesn't play, we forfeit, fellas. - Oh, no. - Batter up! - Show us what you got! - Yeah! - Go on, George! Put it past her! - Way to go! Way to go! - Come on, sweetheart! Knock it out of the park! - Go! Go! - Way to go, baby! - Good! Hold that! - Stay! - Jordan, you're up. - Play to win. - I don't play to lose. - Okay, Jordan, bring me home! - Come on, Jordan, you can it. - Come on, Jordan. - Let's go, girl! Make a hit! - All right, Jordan, show us something! Here we go! - Show 'em what you got! - Strike! - Oh, man! - Aw, come on, Henry! You know that was a ball! - Way to go, girl! - Come on, come on, come on! - Safe! - Whoa! Yes! Yes! - Come on! Yeah! Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! I told you! - Where did you learn to hit like that? Did I mention I got through college on a softball scholarship? - Remind me never to underestimate you again, miss Donovan. - I will, Mr. Ross. - Here comes the slugger. - Morning, guys. Do you mind if I come with you, take pictures of the horses? I won't get in the way, I promise. - Get her a horse. - Now, you know the Indian thanked the white man for giving him horses, because he said it made the landscape look so beautiful. - We're gonna drive them back this way. You just stay on your horse and don't get hurt. - Hyah! - Hyah! Hyah! - Come on! Hyah! Hyah! - Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Get along! Yo, get along! - That's awesome! - What the heck are you thinking? I told you to stay on your horse. - Sorry, I just got caught up in it. - Get on your horse. We'll let 'em loose when the gather's done. Your head cold? - I'll get my hat and meet you back at the barn. - Right! You run these horses as far off Ross' land as daylight will take 'em. - All right, come on! Come on. Hyah! - Go! - No picture is worth risking your life over. - He really cares about me, Jesse. - No, I just don't want some big city lawyer hanging me with a wrongful death suit. - Listen, I'm sorry that I screwed up, okay? - I know. - Hey. I just wanted to check on the flowers. Peggy, Marie, thank you so much. They look beautiful. - You're welcome. - This old church is gorgeous. - Yeah. I always wanted to get married here. Pete insisted we run off to Reno. He lost all our money the first night. We had to come back the next day. Were Tyler and Sarah married here? - Yeah. It was a beautiful ceremony. Tyler and I were baptized here. The funeral for Sarah and the baby was here. A lot of bittersweet memories in this old church. - Well, today there will only be happy ones. I'll get the pictures printed up in New York when I get back, and you'll have them within the week, okay? - I guess you're looking forward to going back. You know, Laurie, I know that you had hoped that Tyler and I would have hit it off, but I think that everyone has kind of an idea of who they want to be with, and I just... I just don't think that Tyler and I are that for each other. - You know, sometimes the right person doesn't always come in the right package. Look at Chuck. He's so quiet, and most women wouldn't even give him a second look. I almost made the same mistake. - Yeah? What changed your mind? - He said... That he knew I was pining for Pete, and that didn't bother him. After all, I wasn't the first person he loved, either. But he wanted me to be the last. - Aw! That's sweet. - He also said that if I couldn't put my past behind me, I couldn't have a future with him. And I nearly lost him, just trying to hang onto something I couldn't have. I was hoping Tyler would come to realize that. - Hmm. - Oh, my goodness, look at me. I've got a wedding to get ready for. Oh, my. Oh. Okay. Well done. All right. Are you ready for this? All right. Don't you give me too big a piece. - Beautiful! - Honey, let's dance. - Okay, I'll be right there. - Tyler. Come here, there's somebody I want you to meet. - All right. - Mrs. Simpson, this is my brother, Tyler. - How do you do, ma'am? - Mrs. Simpson is Chuck's great aunt. - Oh. - He tells me that you have a visitor from New York City. My mother came from there. - Oh, did she? - Yes, she, uh, she came out on a train in 1910. She was a mail order bride, you see. - I see. - Hey, Jesse. - Hi, Jordan, how are you doing? - I'm good, thanks. - Well, did you get enough photos? - Oh, yeah.

A marriage starting here must truly be blessed. - Hmm. - I'm sorry, Tyler. - What for? - I heard about your wife and baby. - Yeah. My daughter was in an Incubator. She was so small. She used to wrap her little... Little hand around my finger. I made every deal with god that I could think of. I couldn't save her... Any more than I could save Sarah. I don't know why I just told you that. - Jordan. I'm about ready to throw the bouquet. You want to come? - Okay. - What are you doing, young lady? - Just taking some photos of the local color. - Am I supposed to be part of that local color? - Yeah. - Wait a minute. You're with the Rosses. Sale barn and the ballgame. - Mr. Jamison, I'm sorry about your daughter, but you know what? You're not the only one in pain. - Who the heck do you think you are, even talking about my little girl? - You got to stop punishing Tyler for her death, because it wasn't his fault. - He didn't stop her. He didn't give a darn about Sarah. - He loved her, and she loved him so much that she took a terrible risk. Can you understand that kind of love? I thought she needed milk. Milk? This horse doesn't drink milk. - She is lucky we found her when we did, though. - Lucky. That'd be a great name for her. Hey. There's nothing better at keeping out the cold. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You know, when the, um, Shoshone were in these parts, that little filly there would have made a... Nice bride price. - A bride price? What's a bride price? - When a... when a fella was... Courting a woman, he would take a horse to her teepee, and if she accepted the horse, then... then they were engaged. - What if she said no? - Well... At least he got to keep his horse. - Ah. Any other, um, interesting traditions? Yeah, there's... There's, um... He, uh... Well, there's... there's the blanket wrap. - The blanket wrap. - Yeah. That was when, um... A brave would, uh... Approach a woman that he... That he fancied, and... And if she liked him... Then she would... Open the blanket... And he... invite him in, and... Just... Wrap it around. I can't do this. - Tyler. - Listen. Jordan, you were brought out here under false pretenses. Saying I wanted to get married. The truth is, I didn't want to have anything to do with you. - I know, Laurie told me. - I'm sorry, Jordan. - It's okay. - I just didn't expect this. - Well, neither did I. A week ago, I thought I wanted to marry Edward. - Edward? Is that your boyfriend? - Yeah. I've been dating him for a long time, but he can't make a commitment, so my best friend Carla answered your ad in my name. She thought it would make Edward jealous. - Did it? - I don't know. I don't care. I think we should talk about Sarah. - No. - I know it's hard, Tyler, but I think we should talk about her. - No. We shouldn't. - What happened to Sarah is not your fault. - I'm sure the horses are just fine. - Morning. - Look, I just need to look for myself, all right? - I'm going with you. - Oh, Jordan. - I just want to help. - Jordan, I don't think it's a good idea. - I'm going with him whether he likes it or not. - The horses didn't force the gate. Somebody opened it. - Jamison. Let's find him. - Head on! - All right. I'll get out in front of 'em. They should follow the stallion. You push 'em. Jordan, you stay clear. We're gonna move fast. - Are you crazy?! Get out of the darn way! All right, drive through her. Woman, you're gonna get yourself and that animal hurt! You're impeding the duties of a federal officer! Now, I ain't gonna tell you again! Get out of the way! You'd better get out of the way! Well, come on! Get after those horses before they get back on Ross' land. - Smile for the camera. Bet the governor would just love copies of these, along with the full story of your version of open range management, Mr. Jamison. You have a good day, boys. - Get on out of here. - Well, ain't nobody chasin' us. She must have stopped 'em. - What the heck do you think you were doing? - Helping? - You've helped enough. Why don't you go home to New York? She could have gotten hurt, Jesse. Or worse. How'd you find me? - Look, I know I have no right to be here. - No, you don't. - Well, I want to change that. Jordan. Listen. I was afraid of making another mistake, but now I'm more afraid of losing you. I love you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. - It's not too late, is it? I mean, you and the cowboy aren't, uh... - No, we're not. Good. Good. Will you marry me? Yes? - Mm-hmm. - Oh. Mm. - Laurie? - Jordan's gone. That guy... Edward, came to get her. It's not too late. You could still catch her. - Why would I want to do that? - 'Cause you love her. - Yeah, well, she'd never fit in here. - That is not the problem, and you know it. She made you feel again, and you don't want to. - Jordan is a very, very talented photographer. She's got her own darkroom. She's got the whole works. - Right? - Yeah. If you'll excuse me for a second. It was nice to meet you. - Alicia, how are you? - How you doin'? - Oh, great. Great. This is the stiffest-looking bunch I have ever seen outside of a funeral parlor. - It's Edward's family from Connecticut and a few of his colleagues from the law firm, you know. - Yeah. And you want to spend the rest of your life around them? - Package deal, what can I say? - You don't seem too thrilled, Jordan. - Of course I am. I'm fine. - Jordan. You really want to go through with this? - Wait a minute, Carla, you're the one that set up this whole mail order bride thing in the first place to get Edward jealous enough to propose to me. So what's your deal? - I didn't do it to get you two together. I did it to give you a chance to see things differently, so that you'd realize you don't have to drag somebody kicking and screaming down the aisle. You deserve better, Jordan. - Edward and I are perfect for each other. We have the same interests. We even vote the same way. - Sweetie, do you really love him? - I'm marrying him, Carla. - Jordan. Honey. I want you to meet these people. Oh, great. I'm thrilled. - Hmm. Well, they're good. Good enough for your own show. You're kidding, right? - Hey. - Oh, hey. I was just leaving you a note. - How do I look? - Like a million bucks. All green and tasty. - I know! Oh, um, going out on a date. Can't be late. Going to le cirque. Jealous? Ha ha! Um, message from Edward on the machine. Have fun, sweetie. Bye! - I'll just tell you about the show that Costa gave me... Later. Okay. - Honey, it's me. Hey, listen. Working a little late again. I'm gonna have to take a rain check on that dinner, okay? I'll talk to you later. All right. I love you. - He's where he wants to be, Tyler. - Is he? - What do you mean, you don't want to get married? - Edward, you are an amazing, amazing man, and any woman would be lucky to be with you, but... - but? I've been very unfair to you. I wanted you to prove your love to me by marrying me. But, Edward, if you truly loved me, you wouldn't have to be pressured or tricked into marriage. You can't force someone to do what you want them to do. It just doesn't work. You have to come willingly to that person. - Jordan. Jordan. We could have the most amazing life together. - I already know what it's going to be like, Edward. Separate last names, separate bank accounts. Spending most of our time apart. Being married is not going to change the way things are. And I'll always be waiting for that moment when you discover that being married was never what you wanted. Well, I guess there's no changing your mind, then, is there? It's a little late for that. This isn't about that cowboy, is it? - No, I'll never see him again. - Well, that's his loss. - Thanks. - Let's go. - I'm in no hurry. We can wait a little bit longer. - What's the point? - Atta boy. Atta boy. - Oh, my! Oh. - Hello? - Jordan? It's Laurie Carter. - Hey, Laurie. How are you? Did you get the pictures? - Oh, my gosh, they are so wonderful. I can't wait to show them to Chuck. It was so nice of you to do this. - Oh, it was my pleasure entirely. Did you get the invitation too? - I sure did. Looks like a big deal. - Yeah, it is. I'm pretty excited about it. So, um... How is everyone? - Oh, we're okay. Everyone misses you. - Yeah, I miss everyone, too. - How's your fiance? Um... Edward. - Hey, Ty? - Yeah? - I got the wedding photos from Jordan. - Oh, good. - They look great. - All right, I'll look at 'em later, huh? She isn't marrying Edward. - I guess that making him jealous thing didn't work, huh? - She dumped him. Now, why do you suppose she did that? - I don't know, and I don't care. - You are dumber than a rock. I know you think loving Jordan is a betrayal of Sarah. I know how much you loved her. But Sarah wouldn't want you to be miserable your whole life. She wouldn't want you to be alone. - There'll be another gather next week. I won't be taking part in it. And I'll see to it they stay off your land. - Why? - Been thinking. Maybe I been wrong about them wild horses. Could be... I been wrong about some other things, too. - As long as people and horses have been around, there's been this myth of man on horseback. It might be a great king or a god or a knight or a warrior or the timeless symbol of the west, a cowboy. Jordan Donovan has captured that powerful myth in her photographs. - Thank you. - Well, Jordan, you're a big success. How does it feel? - Actually, I think I was more excited when I was taking these pictures than I am right now. He's got a horse. - Miss Donovan. Congratulations. You're a big success. - Thank you. Cheers. - Make way here, folks. Coming through. - Will she do for a bride price? - I introduced them. I'm good.
