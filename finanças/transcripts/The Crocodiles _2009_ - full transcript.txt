(Music) Are you scared, Hannes? - He's brave. He'll make it. He's not confident! - All of us went up. Even Peter, who's a chicken. - I am not! But what will we do if he falls off? Duck! (Olli) The pendant is up on top. If you get it, you'll be in. (Music) (Olli) Yes, keep going, Hannes! Shit! Great. (Music) (Music) Ah! - Hannes, come down right now! Yes, Hannes dear, come down! You're still so small! - Small? It's just like you to be so stupid! - Is that how you talk to the boss? Whoever wants to be Crocodile, must go up. - I don't have to. As Olli's sister... - Get him down or I'll tell Dad, that you secretly surf the Internet. - And I'll tell Mom about the lipstick. No more doing your homework! - No more gummi bears from me. Sisters! (Both) Shut up, Frank! It's good that there's a girl here. Emancipation-wise. - I'm up! You see. Totally safe. - Ah! Spazzo, take it easy! It's so dangerous for us down here! Sorry. (Music) Got it! - He's on the roof, he reached the goal. (All) Now he's a Crocodile! (Music) (Exciting music) Ah! Not good! - Help! Maria, call the fire department. (Hannes) Help! No reception! I'm going into town! - Help me! Help! Olli, look out, the ladder! - Ah! Help! Mom? Dad! (Exciting music) Is this the fire department? Someone's hanging from the roof of the old brick factory! Help! Ah! He's falling off. - Everyone, take cover. (Hannes) Help! - Frank, wait. Ah! Ah! Help! (Mobile phone) Mom? I can't talk now. I'll call back. - You got through? Help! Ah! Oh God. Well, come on. I'm so glad nothing happened to you. Is she going to cry? Why? Because my mom doesn't call as often as yours? You dim wits! Whose stupid idea was this? Who are you? We're the Crocodiles. - The Suburban Crocodiles! Bye. Hello. (Music) Oh great, you hero! Oh, oh. I'm Back! - Mom! How was it at the shop? Like usual. - Many customers? - Not for us. After the exam you'll find yourself a well-paid job. Then you can always pay the rent. Yes, if we don't get kicked out by then and have to move in with Grandma. Bon appetit. - Bon appetit. Did you do something special today? - Me? Ah... no. Why? I spoke with Mrs. Koschmieder from next door. - Oh yes. There was something. The fire department brought me home. You got to have a party with the fire department? - Nope. Is your skateboard broken and you hitchhiked a ride home? - Also no. Is it better if I don't know the reason? I'll do dishes. And ironing for a week. If I work all day, I need to know... that you're not getting into trouble here. Is that too much to ask? - No. Take care of yourself. Otherwise I'll no longer have a man in the house. - Yes. I will. Look, I'm a Crocodile now. (Music) Ah ah! Those are Grandma's best dishes! I'll take that. I won't stumble. What is that then? - That arrived today, dear. I don't want to go to the special school! - It's the School for the Disabled. You'll have easier access there. - I have 158 friends. For students at SZV, the computer thingys. - Anyway, 157 more than you. But they're not here. They can't look out for you. Mom, my hair! - Listen, we'll make a deal: If you have friends at the end of holidays, who look out for you in school, just one. Otherwise you may be better off at the School for the Physically Disabled. Unlike you, I'm fine on my own. If you have no friends by the end of holidays, we'll try the special school. By then I'll have 10 friends! (Doorbell) Does Kai Wolermann live here? - Yes, why? - I would like to speak to him. Yes? - Yes. Fine. Kai. Sweetie? - Leave me alone! I'll get him. What do you have there? - What do you want? You called the fire department. I wanted to thank you. Then do it. - I just did. How did you see it? At night I'm a superhero, you know? - I see. Then, thanks again. And get well. Get well? I have a telescope. It cost 200 Euros. Are you a voyeur or something? - Astronomer. But I'm going to be an astronaut. I see. Astronomers foretell good things for my grandma. They also read horoscopes. Cool. Are you rich or something? - Nah. But I actually always get whatever I wish for. I can loan it to you. - We don't have a TV. I prefer playing outdoors. - On gutters? Schni-Schna-Schnappi Fan Club? - We're the Crocodiles. That's our mascot. - Standing for slimy, small, and almost extinct? In other words: courage, strength and honesty. But you'd know nothing about that. I could join. Maybe I'll learn something. (Frank) The spastic? No way! (Olli) Should we build an escalator? He can't even stand lookout. - Or run away. Unless it going downhill. Okay, that was half-witted. If I'd fallen off the roof, maybe I'd be sitting in a wheelchair. Then you'd be kicked out! Handicaps should keep to themselves. - That's "physically disadvantaged." Then Frank is also handicapped. He's physically disadvantaged! Shut up or you'll soon be physically disadvantaged too. We'll vote: Who among you wants the gimp to join us? - I do. I do too. - Maria, did he pay you to do this? I'll explain that to you if you'll grow up. - Two are in favor. Who is opposed? So, the gimp is rejected. (Music) Basketball? - My second broken bone this year. Wheelchair basketball with brittle bones? Not the best idea. - Better than rugby. (Clinking noise) Wait a moment. Something just shattered. - Anyway, it wasn't me. (Exciting music) (Exciting music) 1000 Euros! You can buy a house in Crete for that. With scenic vistas, gardens... And you can buy a closet. With shoes, clothes and things. - But Maria doesn't need such things. What do you mean? - You're more like a boy. With your clothes and stuff. - What? I think they suit you. - You suck-up. He's just has a crush, that weirdo. - He is not, you dork! Heads up... gimp alert. Hi. - Bye. Later. - Wait! I saw the burglary. Really? Were the police called? - Nah. If my parents find out that I can't sleep, I'll have to go to the doctor. Did you recognize anyone? - One had on a camouflage jacket. I know where they went. I'll tell you, but take me along to your headquarters. (Jorgo) Bye. Come one! - Sorry, but I have to go. Wait! Kai saw the burglary. - Hello? He's lying! (Engine noise) What are they doing at our tree house? - Zip it, you child. Yes! You child! - Junior, why is your phone off? Sorry, it's broken. - Just say so and get my old one. We had a little party. - Okay, I'll clean up before Dad comes. That you will. The last time it still stank of beer. - I got it. And for a reward you may also polish the new motorbike... spotless. You'd like one of them too, huh? - Nah, I don't need any penis enlargement. Penis enlargement. Look at this asshole! Tell me, are you crazy? - Watch your mouth, shitface. (Frank) Olli. - Hush. Do you still think I need a penis enlargement? - Yes! Are you suicidal... - He didn't mean it like that! Shut your mouth, fat boy! Olli, Olli. At your age I had exactly the same big mouth. But eventually I had to learn that one respects his elders. They could do you harm. Especially when you least expect it. When you're alone. - Crocodiles are not alone. Never. These little ones are sweet. Truly wild. - Wild, wild. We'll leave before they start howling. - Yes, before they start howling. Howl yourself. - Howl, children. Howl! Howl! Man, are they nuts? Shit. I have to go home to clean up. - CSI is starting soon. Then we'll meet here again tomorrow. See you later, alligator. (Music) Cool. A rocket motor. Hey, my man. Well? What are you tinkering with on your speedster? Chip tuning, lowering the chassis, rocket-turbo. The usual. Just like dad. Look here, I've brought you something. Wow. With steel tips. - Of course. Say, isn't that too dangerous? - It builds strength. The doctor said he should do sports. (Music) (Music) What have I told you, you ass? You may not drive the Sprinter! That can cost me my job! - Yes... - I'm talking now! Man! (Music) The green ones are mine! Bah! Olli! Man, you're disgusting. - What is it? Do you think I want to eat your slobbery gummi bears? You wanted the green ones. - But not from your mouth! Idiot! Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Here! Mom! Mom, are you okay? Wha ... They robbed the shop. They stormed in. I was still in there. Then I wanted to get out and then they... Well, shit. I'll call the police. It's almost 8. You have to leave and register for the exam. No, the police must come by. - By then you'll already be back. Forget it. In order to recoup the losses, I'll have to work through the whole month. What? That can't happen! You studied years for this! I can help you out somehow. I could help out more around here. Or catch the burglars and collect the reward. That's really sweet of you. But you're still too young. Too young? We're a team, Mom! You take your exam and I'll free you from your obligations. Yes, but... - No "but"! I'm a Crocodile. I fell 10m from the roof. I'm not too young! Mom, please, I don't always have to wear the clothes that my cousin does. I would like to travel on holidays, like other kids. I would like to do something with you. That will only happen if you earn more money. Please. Register for the exam. I won't need long. I promise. Take the back route that the fire department uses. It's faster. Yes, Kai here. - Hannes here. You know where the burglars went. Right? Am I in the know? Of course! - Tell me... then I'll take you with me to the Crocodiles. - I don't know whether I have time... Ok, just for you. Let's say, Wednesday? - Let's say, in a half an hour? Okay. That works for me. - Bye. (Jorgo) Have you found my headset? (Olli) It's surely burned up. Really? It was a gift from Mom! - Don't blubber around, help us out! I found a small TV! (Maria) Great, Jorgo. Really great. This is your hideout? Pretty fucked up. What does he want here? - He wanted to come along. Are we a hospital? - Only Crocodiles are permitted to see the quarters! Well, now there aren't any quarters. - Zip it, smartass. What happened? - Frank's brother has torched everything. Or the Taliban from the ghetto. The Gypsies. Or your family, Jorgo. I'm not a gypsy! - We're looking for someplace new. Ecologically speaking, the tree house isn't sustainable. - Yes, and where? The big guys are always around on the Spielers. - No, better not there. How about the old bridge? - The tramps have their camp there. The old brick factory! - Who asked you? He's coming along. - He's a spaz! He saved my life! - Hannes is right. Kai has earned it! When Jorgo wanted to join, everyone was against it at first. - What? But now we like him. Is anybody still against it? Fine, then Kai will come along. (Music) "Trespassing on this property is prohibited. Parents are responsible for their children." Hey, people!? (Frank) He can watch from there. (Jorgo) As an onlooker. Someone have an idea? Olli, Frank and I lift him over. Maria, you fold up the wheelchair. And if you drop him? - Yes, then I'll still be a paraplegic. We'll all go to jail for that. Nah. Parents are responsible for their kids. They'd go to jail. Well, then. (Music) Wow. - Cool place. (Jorgo) Like a ruin in Athens. (Peter) There's certain danger of collapse here. Frank and I will take a look up above. Jorgo and Elvis, check out the front. Peter and Maria, you check the back. Hannes, look after our disabled guest. Bah! Are you sure that the front is clear? Admittedly I'm disabled, but at least I'm not blind. Abandoned. (Hannes) I see how to get up there. Perhaps the burglars are still here. - No, they'd surely rather come at night. Hannes. - Maria. (Both) What are you doing here? Peter is getting his helmet. Because of the danger of collapse. - I see. That thing looks pretty rotten. - Oh, I'm familiar with ladders. Look, totally stable. Shit! Run! - Get away! The rail! You're underneath the rail. Get out! Hannes, I'm stuck! (Kai) Faster! You must get away! Pull off the shoe. - I can't! Hurry! Go! - Go! Hannes! Please! Do it! - Look out! Hannes, quick! Maria? Hannes? Shit. - They're surely dead. Nonsense! Don't say such shit, man! Jorgo, call the fire department. - Got it. Dortmund Emergency Center, hello. - A margarita with extra spicy salami. What, emergency? Sorry, am foreigner, I have dialed wrong. You really look like crap, sister. - Just as always. People? You might want to take a look down here. Gnarly! Dude. What's that? Crazy! Olli, open it up. - It's locked, man. Come on, let me try. - Wow! What is this worth? 1000 Euros. - More. Much more. - 'A million? A thousand Euro reward, if you identify the burglars. Burglars? Here? Conti Road-Attack tires. New! - Hey, Indiana Jones, what about them? Standard tires. Almost every motorbike has them. But these here are really cool! - Ok, I'll go to the police. Why you? We all found the camp. - The reward will be distributed to everyone. If the cops lie in wait, they'll be warned and will lie low. Then we must catch them ourselves. The tires are a good lead. Hannes is right. We must find the loot. We'll stake out the suspects. If they decide to strike, we'll catch them. - How will we do that? We'll follow them with the gimpmobile? - The goods must be returned to the shop! One moment. I've seen it on CSI. Uh-oh, she's looking. Do you have to piss too? - Nope, already have. We won't watch either. - I don't have to. You sweat it out, or what? - We could lift you up. It will be a long day without a toilet. - How long? What would you estimate? If he pisses on me, I'll flip out. Are you going to pull it out now? - With which hand, you jerk? Once it's out, someone has to thump on my belly. Reflex evacuation. Peter, will you come for the reflex evacuation and pull Kai's dick out? W... w... what? Ok, calling for volunteers. Man, guys! You've grabbed it! - What of it? It's just a dick. Maria? I think Hannes also has go urgently. Oh. Babies! Ok, I've printed out the tread patterns. Bye. See you later. - See you later. (Music) (whistles) (Music) Hey, skulker! What are you doing there? Hey! I'm going to get one of these too. R... run! Get out of here! - Get away! Run! Olli! Get out of here! Were you on "Pimp My Wheelchair"? - Hide! Hide! Over there! Look out. - I'm not known to them. They're looking around. Now they're looking right here. Act disabled. Go on! - And how should that be, you jerk? (Biker) Let's move out. They've gone. Hey. You there. Yes, I mean you! You can't just bomb around on the grass with your cart. I would would rather be running. - Hang on. Look, the ruts! Do you know what such grass costs? - Are the disabled prohibited here? Just because he's in a wheelchair he's not allowed to play here? I don't get it. - Let's translate it for you, Macaroni! I'm not Italian! - Makes no difference to me! May we play here if we go on crutches? - Of course you may go on crutches. But that makes a bunch of animal holes. You see. It ruins the grass. Stop it now! What were you thinking? You probably took your bath too hot? - Move out! - Okay, we're going. You can deal with your own problems. - I can't be bothered with such problems. Wait a minute! You can't leave me here alone with the handicap! I can't leave. Lend a hand! - Yes, a hand. What is this shit? Hold on, boy! Do you have a screw loose? - Nothing happened at all. That's abuse of the physically disadvantaged! He can get in here for free. I'll give you a free ticket. For the whole year, okay? I want eight of them. - Hello, is this the police? One moment. Wait. (All) 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... - You dirty little blackmailers. Well, please go. Hi, Mom. Yes, we were joking around. Yes, a joke. If you have to laugh. - Props to you. That was smooth. Not bad for a gimp. - Should we take you home? I won't get in trouble. - Okay, till tomorrow. See you later, alligator. (All) After a while, crocodile. Guys, how's it looking? A little international match against the Albanians? Yes, exactly! An international match! Pass the ball! (Exciting music) Conti Attack. Camouflage. (Music) Hey! Let's go! Hey, Frank, help me out. Thanks. (Metal Music) Is that painful? This is music! - A great ringtone for you, Jorgo! That sounds like you on the toilet! - You really have no taste in music. (Music) Welcome to the new headquarters! (All) Yes! This belongs to the drug dealers in town. The pattern matches. The rockers did it! - Do they have the tires too? Nope. But they chased us. - He was angry about the motorbike! (Scream) It's from the three guys on the Spielers. The pattern is a match. Motocross motorbikes. One of which was brand new. And one had a camouflage jacket in the backpack. Everyone has a jacket like that. (Engine noise) (Dennis) Quickly now! Hurry up! Be right back. - What? Hannes! Don't you know that I don't give a shit? Yes. Tomorrow, 3 pm. Shit. Hello! Man, what's a mongo doing here? Spastic, what are you doing here? Taking a walk. Don't give me that shit, pickled herring. - Yes, pickled herring. Did you get this whole way on your own? Without Mommy, without Daddy? Without Mommy, without Daddy! - He's with us. Look at the toads. What are you doing here, you little turtles? No trespassing. Can't you read? - As well as you can. You bugger off from here. I'll give you two minutes. Two minutes, yes. - Or what? Or what? Don't you know... - Leave him alone! Or I'll tell Dad that you took the Sprinter again. You wouldn't do that. - This is your brother? Hey, little boss! Look at this shit here! Don't! - Leave it! Leave it, man. Want to dance? Dance away! - Leave our hut alone! Hannes! Leave it. Come here! Watch out, he's coming! That was a three-pointer, Dennis! If I catch you here again, I'll make croc' bags out of you. Is that clear? I asked, is that clear? C... c... - Clear. Okay then. Come on, Achmed. - Huh! W... we could build a n... new hut at the old mill. What did it seem Dennis wanted here? He just wanted to look around. Just like us. - With the Sprinter? Perhaps we should call the police. That's my brother! Do you get that? Don't call anyone! Syd Barrett walked out on Pink Floyd and no one supported him. But the band backed him till the end. Can you say that in German too? - I won't diss Dennis. And the reward? - Fuck the reward! Frank's a German, but still our brother. And since Dennis is his brother, we're all quasi-brothers. Theoretically. But I saw the same jacket at the burglary! Everyone has a jacket like that! - The tire tracks are identical too! That proves nothing! The gimp only wants to feel important with his fictional stories! He's sucking up to him, because he can't handle it himself. He's never been a Crocodile. He's just a shitty cripple! These were in the Sprinter. From my mother's shop. Dennis bought those. - There are 10 others in the Sprinter. Liar! Figure it out! Your brother is an ass! A criminal! - How dare you? Olli, say something! - Hey, man! Frank is one of us. His brother is a spaz, but not a criminal. - He is guilty! Without evidence no one is accused! - How much do you need? Then I'll just go to the police myself. - Crocodiles stick together. Always! If you inform on Dennis, you're out! - My mom has no more money. We have nothing to eat. If I don't have the 1000 Euros in 2 days, we'll have to move away again. - Nobody wants you here anyway! Traitor! Hannes, perhaps the others are right. We really don't have enough evidence. Maybe it's really not him. - You're stabbing me in the back? First, you blackmailed me so I'd bring you along, although nobody wants you. And now, you take their side. - Hannes, it's not about going against you. Nah, sure. It might be better for me if I moved away. Maybe I'd find true friends. Hannes! Hannes, wait! - Mom really was right. You can rely on no one besides yourself! We do want to help you! - Who are "we"? You and the Crocodiles? Do you think they'll still be interested in you tomorrow? No one can do anything with you! We've only taken you in so we can find the burglars! You can go right back home again! No one needs you here anymore! (Key turning in a lock) Kai, where were you? - It's still not dark. Why didn't you call? We were worried! - I forgot. You're all wet! You're hypothermic. You know how dangerous that is. I'm okay! Have you nothing else to do other than sit around and worry? Other mothers have jobs. Or friends over for coffee. They have no disabled children, who are so dependent on them. Figure it out finally. I'm dependent on no one. And especially not to you. Uh-oh! Don't you have some sort of shit to do? Ironing or something? Do you have to stand around here and stare at me? Clearly I'm managing by myself. (Music) (Music) Well, you Crocodile? - Well, you nerd? What's with you? Have you gotten into trouble again or why are you so cheerful? No, I'm not getting into any more trouble. - 'Scuse me, you're a grownup. How is it going in your club? - Good. Cool. It's really fun. Nice. I'm happy to hear that you've found friends. Mom? - What is it, big guy? Good luck on the exam the day after tomorrow. Thanks. But I'd rather you wish I'll get enough customers tomorrow. Otherwise I'll have to work the day after, so we can scrape together the rent. Or you'll still grab the criminals and collect the reward. - I will. (Music) (Music) (Olli) Do you have any gummi bears? Get them yourself. Are you lovesick or something? Shut up, Olli. You shut up! Yo, Albanians, want to play? - Yes. (Music) Who said that? You tell me who said that! Was it you? Are you nuts? Are you dumb? How can you ask me that, man? Beat it. Do it for your country, you non-swimmer! Do we all want to take a trip together tomorrow? To the zoo again? - No. Something cool. Dad, when you say it, it's becomes automatically uncool. The old brick factory at the edge of town is going to be blown up tomorrow. - What? Great, huh? Like in a film. Boom! Isn't that dangerous? Shouldn't we be evacuated? To you, everything is dangerous. There must be a little fun! After your last "fun" with Kai, he was a paraplegic. - Mom! Then keep him locked up! In the House, where you can keep watch over him. In the special school, under constant supervision. Then maybe he'd be happy. Like you! That was really shitty of you. One more shit in our lives. That's not the point, right? (Radio) Dortmund. The old brick factory will be demolished next Monday. For 14 years the old factory stood idle under Olbracht GmbH and Company KG. Now plans are being made for a new housing development. Hey, speedster! How are you? - Hmm... and you? It's okay. Someone's saying shit about us. - Really? Yes! You, cripple! You claimed that you saw us at the heist. Yes, that you saw us at the heist. I would knock it off. Ah, stop it! - Understand? We weren't the ones. - Are you crazy? Watch your back, got it? - Did you understand? Hey, dumpling, is everything clear? You got the melon, huh? - Melon. Sorry. Hello. If I may? My helmet! Stop! Out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! (Exciting music) Out of the way! Sorry, guys. Watch out! Ah! (Music) Kai! Boy, what are you doing? Shit. Are you okay? I can't feel my legs anymore. - Did you see? He rode into him! Maybe they were the burglars. - That's enough. We'll report the pigs. (Maria) And what about Frank? (Olli) We'll tell him afterwards. We really don't want to report Dennis! - T... totally without e... evidence. We'll just tell where the cache is. - And the reward? We'll get that. The police will surely find DNA or microfibers from the clothes. That will reveal who the perpetrators are. T... totally CSI-like. Hannes... your pendant, so that the cops know you belong with us. We want to file a report. - Due to a theft. Sit down, wait, shut up. (Policeman) Yes, yes, yes. Our fire department. I'm on lunch break. So! Where's your teacher? - What do you mean? Because we more have important things to do than solve sandwich thefts. We're on holiday and are on a legitimate case. You must be the "Seven Question Marks", right? - We're the Crocodiles! We have evidence for the arrest of the burglary ring! - That's nice, my boy! However, we've already arrested them. Here. They were... The Albanians. - What? It wasn't the Albanians! I'm not an Albanian. We found them with some of the loot. - Do the fingerprints really match? Fingerprints? There are witnesses, you smartass! And so for me the case is closed. I'm on my break now. As for your gang... Get out! - What about the reward? Reward? Naturally the reward goes to the three motorbikers! They gave us the tip. And no one else. It was definitely not the Albanians! - One can't prove anything anyway. Nonsense. They don't speak German. They can't defend themselves. They'll simply be deported. - We'll prove they weren't the ones. We must catch the real burglars. - And how, Zorro Junior? We'll catch them at their camp. - We don't know when they'll be there. True. The brick factory will be demolished. - Nooo! Not another new hut again. Tomorrow morning. So they only have one night left. Mother, please. Don't shout like that, I hear you! (Grandma) Has he found friends now? - No, of course not! What now? - What do I know? Sure, he sits around somewhere all day and claims... - Hello. Peace. - I've removed my shoes. (Grandma) Hello! They drive up the old factory access road. That can be seen well from up here. I'll observe them with the telescope. - I'm in. They come in the back entrance and go to the cache. Here. As proof, we need a photo as they clear out the cache. - I'll do that. From there you have a clear view. - I'll help you. Well? You're playing Legos? Fine. This is an action plan for photo-based crime solving. - Ah. Then I'd better be very quiet, in case we're being bugged, right? Will you close the door? - Yes. Very well dear. One of them will be staying with the Sprinter. - Definitely Achmed. We must disable the Sprinter so that he doesn't escape. - And how? Remove the key? Peter and I will do that. - I... I? Before that, we have to lure Achmed away. Otherwise he'll catch you. I'll do that. I already know how. - Good. Jorgo, you do telecommunications. You and Kai, you monitor the action. When the photo is taken, the vehicle is disabled and the gang is confined, you call the cops. Any questions? (Music) Are you already going? - Yes, but we're coming back. If our hut is blowing up tomorrow, we need new quarters. Bye. (Exciting music) (Alarm) (Alarm) A... a... ow! Hey! Man, Olli. Sister... Good luck tomorrow. (Exciting music) Hi. - Shh! Hi. (Exciting music) (Exciting music) Elvis. Hello! Open up! Hello. Hey. Password? - Open up finally, you spaz! Sorry, that's not the password. Password: "S... save the A... Albanians." Maria: Channel 1. Olli: Channel 2. Hannes: Croco-Cam. If you push "Page All", you transmit on all channels. So be careful. Kai and Hannes: Take your position. Now we'll make the assholes pay. What do you mean, how deep is that? - Deep enough. It doesn't look so rotten. - I know what I'm doing with this, believe me. I'm sorry that I was so mean to you yesterday. No apology needed. I was cowardly, to not have stood by you. Already forgotten. How did that actually happen? To your legs. I was shopping with Dad. We screwed up. He was pushing me around in the shopping cart. Totally childish. Oh well. He tripped, tried to hold onto the cart, and gave it even more momentum. Along with me, in the cart, towards the bannister. The cart stopped, I continued to fly and landed a floor below on the garden tools. Ouch. - Yes. Complete paraplegia. Anyway, only the 11th vertebrae. Otherwise I couldn't pee anymore. It certainly sucks for your father. It's just bad luck. It wasn't intentional. My father ran off shortly after my birth. No wonder. With such a son. My parents were still really young when I arrived. It was too much for them. Is that why you think you can rely only on yourself? Could be. Is there a chance that you can walk again someday? No. No matter. I play basketball while sitting, and can also become an astronaut. Ultimately, in weightlessness, no one can walk. If you need a co-pilot for the Space Shuttle, just call me. I will. (Olli via radio) Hey, you spazzes! Are you blind? Shit. Croc 1 in position 1. Activity at the back entrance. Croc-eye in position. Is the battery charged? Then I'll switch off the flash. Stay back there! (Exciting music) Phase 1 in 3... 2... 1 (Music) (Clanking) What was that? Achmed, what was that? - No idea. Then look, you weirdo! - Yes, exactly, you wierdo! Yes, you blondies. Thing's are heating up. - Give it some gas. Team Sprinter underway. (Bang) (Music) (Dennis) Grab it underneath and on top. Hey, Achmed! (Kevin) Help us carry this! I can't see their faces. I'm going closer. - I'm coming along. No. That's too dangerous, Baby. - Baby? Baby... Croc-eye going in closer. - To where exactly? Towards the burglars! Kevin, move faster. Come on! Come on. O... Olli. K... Key. Shit. Light out. Here comes someone. Man! What are you doing here? - I texted him a message. And what are you doing here? - Here. Look. That's ... That cannot be. That's Dennis. Dad has told him so often he shouldn't take the car. This means trouble. I'm truly sorry. Previously, he was somehow there for me more and all. If he goes to jail, you'll still have us. We're your brothers too. I... I have an idea. As seen on "Two Stealhearted P... P... Professionals". What? Shit. What are you doing? Hey, everything okay? - Sh... shit, man! D... diesel. Now I have you, little Crocodiles. You've made Uncle Achmed angry. If I find you, I'll bite you all in the ass. I coming now! Ah! Hey, guys. Help me out here! Quick, help me out of here. What's happening now? Hey! There he is. Do you have it? - Yes. Just you wait, you asshole. I'll get you! They're after Hannes. - Shit. Jorgo, call the police. Jorgo! - Yes! Shit, it went down. Do it! Quickly! - Calm down. This has happened before! Fucking hell. What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? Shut up! Give me the camera. - Camera? - You give me the camera! Yes, exactly! The camera! - Give it to me instead! To assault someone smaller, is really the lowest of the low. The cripple again? - Hannes, call the police. The party's over. - Stay there. The dick and the cripple want to give me orders? Call me cripple once more. You wouldn't dare, cripple. (Both) Fucking hell! The cripple shot me in the leg! - Don't say cripple again! Hello? This is Hannes Burgsmüller. This is an emergency. Come quickly! "Hello? Hello, where are you?" I'll make you pay. - Leave him alone. I warned you, cripple. Don't you get it? Don't call him that! Crocodiles, grab him! - Yeah! Yes! - Let me through. Ok. Ok! You've won. You've won! What do you want? Do you want a DVD player? A game console? Yes? - You leave us alone from now on. Never come back to our hut! - You exonerate the Albanians! You give Mom her things back! - Dennis! The cops! (Sirens) This can't be happening! They could never get here so fast. Never underestimate a Greek and his cell phone. Get moving! (Engine dies) Well. O... out of fuel. Dumb luck. - Well done. (Policeman) So, that's it! Search and arrest them. Back to the station, come on. There's another one! Pick him up! By the way, the "one can rely only on himself" ... Yes? That's total nonsense. (Music) (Announcement) Attention! Two minutes till demolition! A stupid comment about the dress, and I'll punch you out. For me? A hand bike! Now that the goods are recovered, Mom doesn't need the money anymore. Elvis can't pull you to school every day. And with this everyone will know whom he is with and not to say "spastic"... He didn't climb to the roof but still reached the goal. (All) Now he's a Crocodile! And? - Well, there it goes... There it goes with the crappy job. I passed. - You're so cool! No, you're cool. You're the coolest son one could wish for. Without you I'd be in a fix. I'm so proud of you, my big guy. - Oh, Mom. Cry me a river. Oh Jorgo, the world offers more than mobile phones and action movies. You'll learn that someday. (Announcement) Attention, we are ready! The blasting commences in 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1. Subtitles by HungryHippo (Theme song starts...) I believe in you.
