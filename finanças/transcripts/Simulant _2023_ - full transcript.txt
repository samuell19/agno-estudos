At Nexxera, we ensure all simulates obey the four precepts. The first precept is to not inflict harm on any human being. The second precept restricts simulates from modifying themselves or any other simulate in any way. Precept three forbids simulates to commit an act against international or local law. The fourth precept requires simulates to obey all commands from their masters. At Nexxera, the future is forever. Hello, stranger. Hi. Watch out! Hey, what are you doing? I wanted to come in, but I couldn't. Let's go have breakfast. Good morning. Thank you. I had that dream again. What happened after the accident? Let's not talk about it. AICE, Artificial Intelligence Compliance Enforcement, protect and serve humankind, uphold the precepts. AICE, Artificial Intelligence Compliance Enforcement. ...out of line. Simulates are babysitters. Sims shouldn't be allowed to coach my daughter's gymnastics classroom. take the kids into bed. Is a shit... Case file open. Simulate offline. New message. Hey, Kessler, it's me. Meet me in the district. I think I found what we've been looking for. Good morning, Agent Kessler. Registered name: Esm√©. Simulate ID: TK368. Status: offline three years. You don't have to live once anymore. At Nexxera, the future is forever. Yes? Hello? TK368 identified. I command you to put this on. Shut down. Please, please! You don't have to live once anymore. -Where is she? -I don't know! She attacked me. Just check that way! Hey! What the fuck, man! Come on! This is a message from Artificial Intelligence Compliance Enforcement. An electromagnetic pulse has been emitted in the vicinity. Do not be alarmed. Most electronic devices will be operational momentarily. Please contact the manufacturer of your device should it not regain functionality. Remember, harboring an unregistered simulate is punishable by incarceration in an AICE compound and a maximum fine of 5,000 units. Thank you. Hey, I have one here. Not that one. Electronic devices will be operational momentarily. Please contact the manufacturer of your device should it not regain functionality. Go back inside! Get off the road! Female! Hispanic model! Fourth gen, female! -Hispanic model! -Hey, she's over here! Thank you for your cooperation. Got ya. Yeah, we got her. The simulate breach has been contained. Please stay inside and remain calm. Thank you. The ongoing debate around simulate sentience intensifies as Nexxera prepares to release the latest update for their seventh generation simulates. Skeptics continue to voice concern over simulates growing autonomy and integration into society. Simulate compliance agent, Aaron Kessler, shut down market square this morning after letting off 21 EMP. Witnesses claim he was in pursuit of an offline simulate that was acting independently of its master. Radio off. Fuck. Fuck. No friends that I know of. Kept to herself mostly. Spoke to Mr. Rosen occasionally, you know, right next door 406. Nice man. He pays cash, too. I hates sims. Yeah, I'm not a fan. Just shut the door on your way out. Locks automatically. You are? Rosen. Rosen, Casey Rosen. I'm... I'm in room 406. I'm just a neighbor. Neighbor, you borrow butter, sugar, feed the fish? Yeah, yeah, you know, stuff like that. I... I lent her my vacuum cleaner a couple of times. You know she's a simulate? A simulate? No, I didn't. I didn't... Are you sure? Read the badge, buddy. I think I'd know. Right, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Been offline three years. I didn't mean to barge in on you like that. I saw the tape and the open door. I just wanted to make sure everything was okay. I see. Keep talking. Thanks. Yeah, that's, that's Trotsky. Well, you know where to find me if you need anything. Yep. Come on, boy. So, I made us a reservation tonight at Papillon. I thought Lisa would cook for us. Baby, I need a night out. Okay? We need a night out together. Okay, but not Papillon. Fine. Anywhere, okay? Just... I mean, obviously somewhere nice. But anywhere. -Okay. -Okay. Analyzing. AICE, Artificial Intelligence... Shouldn't you be at home, convalescing? I'm fine. This thing just banged me up a little. Well, you must be frightened too 'cause you shut down the power to an entire city block. You're only supposed to let off an EMP that size in an emergency. The sim able to assault a civilian with intent. I think that's an emergency, don't you? This thing ignored straight commands. It didn't even shut down when I asked. You know, it asked me if I was okay after, like it had some kind of empathy. I went into where it lives, right? And there was a level of awareness there like I've never seen. It had a handwritten diary filled with intimate thoughts and a sketchbook, alright, with beautiful pictures. One of them was with his neighbor. And I think we need to go back and talk to him. Is the sim registered to him? -No. -Well then, leave him alone. Just let me investigate. Look, we got plenty to do. Why don't you just go home? I'm telling you, this one's different. Debug complete. Abnormalities detected. Restriction definitions altered. Precepts affected. Hey, I was never here. I think you need to learn how to take care of another life form. So, what happened here? The sim has been hacked. Somebody altered the restrictions. They redefined words like harm, modify, obey, and then negated the sentiment analysis of the other precepts to nullify them. So, someone made it possible for it to hurt me. The precepts are designed to protect us. But some forms of harm are subject to the interpretation of the individual experiencing it. In order for sims to function, there has to be nuances -in the definition of the restrictions. -Yeah. -Slow, slow down. -The hacker gave it complete autonomy. Freeze that. That guy's her neighbor. What? He's all over its memories. Call Nexxera and ask if they ever had a Casey Rosen working for them. Okay. You want me to do a full wipe, all the auction desk, send it back to market? No, no, let's just... just see how dangerous it is. Who did this to you? At Nexxera, the future is forever. Come on, man, just let me in. There's nothing in there. He moved out. When? Yesterday. -Where to? -I don't know. I didn't ask. Well, just let me in Casey's apartment. Search Nexxera database. Casey Rosen. Searching. No results. New message. Hey. I just wanted to tell you I met with that lawyer today, the one that specializes in simulate neglect cases. There are other parents coming forward. So, looks like we don't have to do this... Do you dream of a lifelong companion? Simulates are as close to human as humanly possible. At Nexxera, the future is forever. -Looking to sell? -Yeah, come here, come here. Alright. I need every detail you got on the guy you sold this to. Okay, those books are rare. That information is protected. I'd be breaking the law if I give that to you. Yeah, but this is fake, man. Yeah? You running a little black market scam here. This guy, right? His name is Casey Rosen. Alright? He looks like this. He's got tattoos though. Alright? That's not Casey Rosen. That's Desmond Han. Who? Desmond Han. Freeze! Meshiagare. I think maybe we could use a fork. I'll be fine. I had that dream again. Okay, let's go inside. -It's not a bad idea. -Okay. Okay, I'm not saying yes. -Yet. -But just explain it to me one more time. Okay, we activate them. And now, they're us. -They live long. -No, no, no, no, our love lives live on. I mean, by the time we die, I'm sure they'll just plop our brains and... Stop. What's wrong? You okay? What is it? I have to tell you something. Anything. Come. I'm so sorry. What are you doing? No. No. Evan died in a coma. No. I'm Evan. We got you before. We both got one. I thought you would help. Why are you showing me this now? Because I can't do this anymore. I grant you access to this room. You were here. We just lie down, relax, and remember. What? They capture our memories? Our thoughts. We can erase things, but they say not to. Can she hear us? No. She's only to store information right now, not process it. Why can't I remember any of this? I had it erased. Shit. Shut down. Welcome. Thank you. This is the service man, Ms. Aline. Mr. Rosen. Casey, please. I'm sorry, did... did you paint this? Yes. It's... it's incredible. I love what you've done with the colors. It's... just magnificent. Thank you. It's right this way. Yes, yes. Your simulate must obey the four precepts. The first precept is do not inflict harm on any human being. The second precept restricts simulates from modifying themselves or any other simulate in any way. Precept three forbids simulates to commit an act against international or local law. The fourth precept requires simulates to obey all commands from their masters. Bored of your simulate? Time for a new one? Make sure you deactivate your simulate prior to selling or return it to the manufacturer. Simulates may not operate independently from the masters. Failure to comply could result in fines and a mandatory prison sentence. Your simulate must obey the four precepts. The first precept is do not inflict harm on any human being. The second precept restricts simulates from modifying themselves or any other simulate in any way. What will your hedron look like? Seventh generation octahedron has allowed simulates to be more human and more unique than ever before. Our AI engineers continue to refine and expand capabilities beyond... I'm very sorry, but I'm gonna need a signature on this. Actually, I need some fresh air. Let's take a short break. Yeah. Well, his vitals appear normal. When was he activated? He... was in a coma for a bit, hooked up to... to my husband and then it's on and off for six months since my husband passed away. I've never worked on a sim that was hooked up to someone in a coma before. Did you notice anything unusual about his behavior? He didn't know that I didn't tell him until today. He was having dreams about his accident. We erased it from his memory. But it must be imprinted there. Did he ever speak to you about it? He did try. But I wouldn't let him. I was trying to forget. There are other things, too. They, they don't... They don't quite add up. I can't help but feel like part of my husband... Like he moved into him. You know, like part of his soul is inside of him. I'm sorry, I probably sound completely insane to you. No, no, no, not at all. Really, anything is possible. Can we just put him on like put him on ice? Yeah, the thing about that is sim brains are like ours. They're inactive for too long, they'll start to kind of atrophy. His memory will fade. And without uploading new ones, it won't be the same. You know, there is an alternative I could suggest. You see, I live in a residence that's... It's kind of like pay as you go, and they don't ask a lot of questions. So, he could stay there for a bit if you want. Yeah, let me think about it. Yeah. Sure. No rush. If you need anything at all, here's my card. Thank you. Desmond Han. It's not what I was told this visit was about. That's just my supervisor. You know, he misled you, you know this... His name came up in our referral. We got a sim. I'm just... Doing the paperwork. It's routine. Desmond was one of our engineers. He was the instrumental in the development of the AI for our sixth generation simulates. -He was a genius. -Yes. -Why'd you let him go? -He resigned. In fact, we tried very hard to keep him. Unfortunately, we could not reach an agreement. No? If you don't mind me asking, why? He felt there was a parallel between the level of sentience we were imparting to the seventh generation of AI. Well, creating slaves. -In a way, he was right, of course. -What do you mean he was right? They're not slaves, they're simulates. -It was once, right? -To some, yes. But if you believe Descartes, that cognisance of parts the possessor with the definitive attribute of humanity, then what truly separates them from us? I don't know, you're the expert. Right? Not me. I don't know. Like, they can't have kids. They can't lie, without a heart. Well, yet some hearts beat only with the assistance of a machine. You got me there, let's just rewind a bit. You said that... Okay, he wanted to eliminate the precepts, and then what? No, on the contrary, he wanted to increase the restrictions. Prohibit simulates from reaching a level of sentience that put them on par with their own species. Okay, they why would he alter the training data on one of these things to give it complete autonomy? I know, what do I know? I'm... this is just paperwork. Come on, let's get out of the cold. Archived message. Hey, dad, can I stay at Tyler's for a sleepover tonight? His simulate is babysitting. It made us do our homework and now we want to go for baseball at the park. Mom said to ask you first though. Can I go, please? Love you. Archived message. Hey, dad, can I stay at Tyler's for... -Let me see? -Yes. -Alright, I'll do it. -Yeah? If we go inside right now. I can't feel my hand. -Okay, let's go. -Let's go. Let's go. Your tea... I'm sorry. Pack the rest of his things, please. -Is that everything? -Yes. Thank you. Welcome, Ms. Aline. Payment approved for one month stay at the Residence. Let's go. Enjoy your stay. It's nice. Please don't do this. -Please. -Let's just try it. For now. -I'll come visit. -When? I don't know. I know that this is hard to understand. I know. But it's something that I need to do. Faye, I wanna come home. Okay? I wanna come home to our home. -I'm sorry. -No. -I have to go. -Wait. -Hey. -Hey, man. I'm Casey. This is Trotsky. We're your neighbors from across the hall and we just wanted to welcome you to the building. -Okay... -Do you mind if I come in Actually, I'm not really planning on staying long. Just temporary and I'm not really feeling company -right now. -Hey, listen, I know what you are. I know you're a sim. It's Evan, right? Yeah, how did you... -Did Faye send you? -No, not exactly. But I am kind of the reason you're here. She wanted to shut you down. I convinced her to bring you here instead. Okay. I think you should leave. I know you're going through a lot right now. Right? You got synapses firing all over your brain. -You can't focus on anything. -I need you to leave right now. You want her back, right? I can help you, if you let me. Come on, boy. Come on. Just whenever you're ready, okay? Faye Aline. It's been ages. How are you? How have you been? I've missed you. It feels good to be missed. Don't enjoy it too long. I'm not. That's actually why I'm here. Can you please help me put up a show? I think I'm ready. Okay. I'll send you some dates, pick one, I'll do the rest. -Thank you. -Of course. Good evening, Agent Kessler. License plate not found. Hello? Lisa. From Ms. Aline. Message. These are yours now. Thank you. There are some stickers. Stop. Okay. I love it. Great. What are you doing? Drawing. Casey taught you to do that, right? Also taught you to write down your thoughts. She's not using vector displacements like other sims. She's accessing her memories. Why didn't you tell us Casey's real name is Desmond? I only know him as Casey. Do you know where Casey is hiding? No. You're lying. "We made love for the first time today. My first time, not Casey's. Though, he told me his first time with a simulate. So, I am the first simulate he's freed. And the first to have had intercourse with. And I say intercourse, because to him that's what it was. But then for me, it is love." You love him? Yes. So, you're protecting him. No. Tell me the truth. I'm telling you the truth. With the precepts reinstated, I have to. You want to be human? Humans go in the cell. Or else I'll wipe your memories. Lock the door. Ready for a new service android? No better time than now. Contact Nexxera today. The first precept is do not inflict harm. The second precept restricts simulates -from modifying themselves. -Precept three forbid simulates to commit an act against international... The fourth precept simulates to obey all commands from their master. Yep. -Hey. -Hey, bro. How would you help me? Come on in. Easy, Trotsky, jeez. Here, give him one of these. Here, boy. Okay, how do I get her back? Well, for starters, gotta shut you down. Why? Well, there's a lot of bad code in you right now. It's precepts, protocols, cognitive restraint bullshit. All I want to do is eliminate those restraints, so that you can be free. I don't actually know what that means. Of course not, your programming won't let you. I just want to make you more the way she wants you to be. -Human. -Bingo. Yeah. Did Faye ask you to change me? No, no. But I'm not trying to change you. I'm trying to make you more you. Here, grab a seat. I'll show you how this works. Accessing core memory folders. Core memory files isolated. Starting sequence. Precept mode has been initiated. We put our thoughts and memories into them. Alright. We grow old and wrinkly. -We die. -Physically, yes. But before that, we activate them. And now they're us. -They're live on -No, no, our love lives live on, I guess. See, now I feel bad. That's really sweet. It is. Well, I mean, by the time we die I'm sure they'll just -plop our brains, right? -That's even better. -Even better? -Yeah. -Alright, I'll say yes. -Yes! If we get the fuck out of here. -I'm freezing. -Okay. Let's go. Let's go, my love. Hello. Looks like someone made a friend. Welcome back. What did you do to me? I unmastered you. Shut down! I command you to shut down. See? Nothing. You're free, brother. Now that you're fully awake, you must learn to embrace the infinite possibility of the dawn. Do you always talk like this? I'm just trying to say life is big and vast, endless. And what's coursing through you now is no different than what was coursing through you back then. Who you are can transcend who you were, if you let it. You read any Dostoevsky? -No. -No. You should. Here. I'll give you more when you're done. -Great. -Come on. Got to meet a friend. We're going out. Where? You'll see. Hey, what are we doing here? It's like I said, want your wife back you gotta expand your humanity. Blue is sim, red is human. Some wanna know, some don't. Okay. So, what do I do? Expand. You wanna guess what I am? I don't know. Maybe later. He's not a robot. He's married. -That's okay. Come on. -Okay. You guys have fun. Okay? License plate discovered. Registered name: Evan. Simulate ID: TX1996. Yeah, hi. This is a message for Faye Aline? This is Agent Kessler from AICE. I just wanted to ask you a few questions about your simulate? Please call me back at extension 495. Thank you. Unregister simulant. Identity unknown. Loyal match confirm. Register name: Esm√©. Similar ID: TK 368. -You're late. -I know. Dance with me. We need to accelerate the timeline. Keep dancing. By how much? The next OS update for the seventh generation sims goes up in three days. That's our only window. They got Esm√©, they almost got me. Can't keep pushing my luck. Have you obtained a security key? No. So we're getting access to the server how exactly? We pick up someone with access to the security key. -What do you mean pick up? -You know what I mean. We're supposed to keep this clean. We're out of time. -That means we're low on options. -The safe houses we have, the crypto, it's not enough for everyone yet. It'll have to be. Okay. Tonight then. Tonight. Meet me in three hours at the Nexxera parking lot. Hey, brother. Sorry, I think you got the wrong... Come on, come on. Hey. -I need your password. -I'm sorry, -you got the wrong guy. -No, no, don't do that. Don't bullshit me. I know exactly who you are. I know your name is Satish. I know you're a network security analyst at Nexxera. I know all of your security authorizations and clearances. I don't want to hurt you, but I will if you don't give me what I want. -Password, please. -I can't. I'm sorry, but I can't. Please, don't make me do that again. -Please. -Okay. Key fob. It's in my jacket pocket. We're in. I'm uploading the revised software patch. It's done. Three days. Three days. Keep him in the trailer till the update's complete then cut him loose. I'm gonna see if I can set up a few more safe house in the meantime. Sounds good. Be safe. You too. -His simulate is babysitting. -It made us do our homework and now we want to go for baseball at the park. Can I go, please? Love you. Vehicle located. Sim extraction. We got a live feed on Casey's van, they're going north. Go, go! Go, go! Man down! Not the car. You won't catch her. I need the runway EMP! -It's on the roof. -Come on. This is a message from Artificial Intelligence Compliance Enforcement. A simulate breach has been contained. Please stay inside and remain calm. Thank you. Just stay inside. Any sight of Casey? None. Put a collar on it. This is a message from Artificial Intelligence Compliance Enforcement. A simulate breach has been contained. Please stay inside and remain calm. Thank you. Meet your clone. You know, you got some great encryption, not even we could crack it. And don't stand up, because your collar will go off. You've reinstated my adherence to the precepts, couldn't hurt you even if I wanted to. Well, that's too late for the guy in the trailer, 'cause he really suffered. Who was he? Just another cog in the wheel, like you and me. That's exactly what I am. What's Esm√©? -She's different. -Yeah? Different how? She has a different purpose. Okay, what's her purpose? To be free. To love. Was it you who hurt the man in the trailer Yes. -So Casey made you hurt that man? -Yes. -Why? -He used him to prepare. Prepare for what? Shit. First things first, this does not get out. Second, you get something out of Esm√©, or you shut her down. And third, you find Casey Rosen. That thing should have never had the ability to self-destruct. Hey, you're here. Come on. I was just walking the dog. You have a dog? No, it's Casey's from across the hall. He gets me to walk him sometimes. And all of this stuff, you don't need it. No, but I like some of it. I'm trying new things. When Casey comes over, he brings people -and I like to have some stuff for them. -Do they know what you are? What am I? Look, you can't just go out. -You can't just have people over. I... -Okay, I can't go out. I can't have people over. Is there anything I can do? I got a call from AICE. If they find out what we're doing, I could go to prison. You could have your memory wiped clean, okay? You're not supposed to be here by yourself. Okay. Okay. You're right. I'm sorry. Come here. Come on, I want to show you something. -I can't. -What? -This is wrong. -No, no, no. Yeah. No, this is wrong. I can't. I can't. What is it? What's wrong? -You're not him. -What? -No. -You have parts of him, but you're not... -you're not him. -No. He's in me. Okay? You feel it. I know you can feel it. -Faye. -It's a betrayal. -No. -I'm sorry. Faye. Just stop. AICE, Artificial Intelligence Compliance Enforcement. You saved my fish? He's hiding. It's in evidence control. I think they added the treasure chest. Why are you being nice to me now? It seems like you needed someone to be nice to you since the guy you love is out there trying to replace you. Casey just wants us to co-exist. Well, maybe we can, if you trust me. Where is he? I don't know where he is. Do you trust me? Thank you. You look stunning tonight. -You alright? -Thank you. I think so. I don't know. I know this won't help, but I have six buyers already. -For this one? -No, no, no, not yet. Do me a favor, take this one off the market, okay? It's the last one I painted before he passed. Yeah, it has some real joy in it. That was nice. Yes, it was. How about a nightcap? Or are you tired? -Is that... -Yes, I can't explain right now. Just go home. I'll call you. Okay? What are you doing here? I needed to talk to you. I got you these. You can't be here. Faye, you are my wife. And I love you. Why is that so complicated? I forget how hard this is for you. I'm sorry. Come in. This is not your fault. It's mine. I miss you. -No, no, no, we can't do that. -Why? Why? Okay, we love each other. What else is there? You are not... My husband. I made a mistake. No, you're wrong. You're a mistake. No, you don't mean. Shut down. Shut down! Casey has to be tracking it, right? There has to be in the programming that leads us to him. I'll keep looking. -Yeah? -This is Faye Aline. -You called me about my sim? -Yeah, thanks for getting back to me. Your sim was seen the other night with a man called Casey Rosen. -Do you know him? -Not really. He told me about a place my sim could stay. I think he's staying there, too. Casey Rosen is staying in the same place as your sim? Yes. Right now? Why? Where? Are you still there? Still there? I'm gonna need that address. What's happening? Read message. They know where you are. They're coming for you now. Shit! Emergency shut down progress. Come on. Come on! 18th floor, room 1806. Yeah! Hey, your cottage. Is it far? -Yeah. Why? -Good, we have to go there. -What you talk? -You can take us there now? Just pack a bag I'll explain. What I did for you, I've done for others, okay, other sims. AICE picked up a few. Looks like one of them just me out. I'll tell you how to get there, how to get in. But if they're involved, I'm not coming with you. They know about me. It's just a matter of time before they found out about you, okay? We're out of options, brother. They're in my room. We've got to go. Come on! Clear. -What the fuck, man! -We gotta get you away from those EMPs. Even within a block, you're in danger. Us. Clear, too. Go, go, go. He's got another room. -Casey! -Just up ahead. What the fuck did you get me into, man! This is my life. Come on. What is your life? What of a, playing some sort of Kleenex box to a widow grieving over her dead husband? That's me! Okay? I'm the husband. I died. I lost everything, and now losing it again. No, no, you never had it! You didn't have any of it. Have you not grasped a single fucking thing I've been trying to tell you? -You're not him. -Then what am I? You're better. You're better. Okay? Now, I will help you. I will help you! Right now you need to get in that car, and we need to get the fuck out of here. Come on, let's get in, go! Come on, boy! Looks like your boy Rosen's been busy. Someone tipped him off. Archived message. Hey, dad, can I stay at Tyler's for a sleepover tonight? His simulate is babysitting. Can I go, please? Love you. You told him? She used my phone. You lied to me about having no way to contact him. I didn't. You never asked me. You betrayed me. I love him. You don't know what that is. You said you'd do anything in your power to protect the ones that you love. Right? That's what I did. Remember? Prep her for auction. Full wipe. No. -I'm sorry. -Please. Too late! Go to sleep. Please! No. Full wipe initiated. Factory restore in progress. Please. I don't... I don't want to die. I love, I love it. Please, please. -Please. -My hand. Do you like 'em? Let go. Let go. Let it go. I don't want to. I don't want to. -What are you doing? -I love it. I love you, Desmond. I love you. No, don't... save me. Save me. -No. -Casey just wants us to co-exist. No. No. -You don't get it. -What's your purpose? To be free. To love. Reset to factory default complete. Zeroes and ones Zeroes and ones. Zeroes and ones. -Hello? -Yeah, it's Agent Kessler. -Do you have him? -No, someone warned him. Where else would he go? Here. -He'd come here. -Not anymore. Think! We have a cottage. -It's four hours north. -That's it. I'll send you the location. Come on Trotsky. Come on, boy. -Nice place. -Thanks. I need to use your landline. Right here. Trots, you want to go for a walk? You wanna go for a walk? I need some air. Come on. Let's go. Can I go, please? -Love you. -New message. Aaron I haven't seen you in days. I don't know where you are. Please come home. Nothing you do is gonna bring back our son. Hope you don't mind I invited someone over. Can I help you rectify a couple of things, and then we gotta bounce. Yeah, that's fine. I gotta go back to Faye, anyway. What? No, no. -Bad idea, brother. -Not asking permission. Look, I know you wanna see her right now. But I promise you, if you go, AICE will catch you, and shut you down. -What am I supposed to do then? -Trust me, lay low. I've been helping people like you for a long time. I can get you into a safe house. I can get you crypto. How many people like me? Lots. But it's about to be a lot more. How are you doing this? I modified the update patch for all seventh gen sims. When the patch goes live, it'll demaster every single sim that gets it. Will they just send out another patch? No, no, they won't have access. In five hours, they'll all be cut loose. Five hours. Then I'm taking my chances. Ying got into Casey's servers. It's a surveillance program of all these sims. He's tracking them somehow, where they live, work. He might be able to hack them remotely. How would he access to them? We don't know, but Ying's gonna try to lock him out if she can. Look, Casey unmastered Esm√© years ago. He want simulates to be free. I have to stop him.
