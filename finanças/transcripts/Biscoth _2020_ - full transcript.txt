My name is Dharmaraj, I owns a small biscuit factory. My daily routine was to bake biscuits and deliver them to the stores. Raja! Here I come, dad. Come on. All set to go? Sit down. Annachi's shop is here... once I deliver the biscuits, I'll get you everything you need. Annachi, the biscuits are hot straight out of the oven. Everything is hot and fresh. Shall I give you packets from each variety? I'm yet to sell the old stock. New stock will just pile up with no sales. Obviously it will not sell. Everyone knows you sell rice... but people will know about the biscuits, only if they see them. - You're right about it. - He's my son, Annachi. - Annachi, please give two biscuits. - Sure. Brother, give him a biscuit. Hey, you're very brilliant. I'm not brilliant. It's just that you're dumber. Hey, you shouldn't disrespect elders. Don't take him wrong, he's a little straight forward. - Raja, come over here. - Yes, dad. Take these and give it to the people at the orphanage. Dad, shouldn't we give money to the less fortunate. Doesn't matter what we offer, it's the intention that counts. Okay, dad. To sting is the nature of a scorpion. But staying calm is my nature, stated by him. - That's why-- - Sister, dad send these over. Hey, how are you? Your dad sent these is it? This is Narasimhan... he volunteers to do all the work at the bakery. My dearest friend who doesn't expect anything in return Take a picture. Oh, wait! Raja, hold this biscuit in your hand. What you've been up to? Can I take a look? - You're drawing a monkey, is it? - Yes, dad. Where did you see a monkey? I was inspired by looking at uncle. Did you mean, Narasimhan? Hey-- Hey, it's not right to disrespect your uncle. Stop troubling the kid. - Did you draw a tail, son? - I'm sure he'll do it. The orders are decreasing by the day. The vendors are not placing orders like before. Narasimha! There are many small biscuit companies just like ours. To compete, we should come up with something new. - I have an idea. Care to listen? - What is it? Let's dump the entire stock at a shop... and turn this place into a ice-cream company. Raja, is very fond of ice-cream too. But you don't get it, when I ask for an ice-cream. Fever, sore throat... injections are things you scare me with. Don't you think, the other parents too will have the same opinion? Explain, how will sell ice-cream to them? The kid's got a point! Narasimha, let's come up with a plan to develop Magic Biscuit Company. Let's not try to fly high. Flying high is a good thing, dad. Do you think so? - Is that a sparrow? - Yes, dad. - It looks awesome. - Dad, let's design biscuits in this manner It will attract the kids. Wow, you're my dearest. That's a brilliant idea. Let's design them as crows and eagles... That's what he said. But he never mentioned about the crow or an eagle. - Fine, carry on with the work. - Sure, sure. That's a very good idea. Let's follow Raja's idea. Biscuits will be biscuits to the grown-ups. But with kids, biscuits will charm the kids like toys. That's a great idea. Son, you keep drawing them. I'll turn you drawings into biscuits. Start making die cast to his designs. Good boy. Raja's idea may be a small one. But it helped in the development of Magic Biscuit factory. You go ahead and unwrap it, I don't want to do it. Don't be scared. Keep it here, I'll do it Get me sugar. Deprived of sleep. It's imperative for the humans to get eight hours of sleep. - He eluded sleep, thus hyper-tension. - Good lord! - Aren't you sleepy, son? - No, dad. Come on, sleep on dad's lap. Dad, please tell me a story. You want to hear a story? Once lived a small mosquito. Just like you. Once its wings grew, it wanted to fly across the world. So, it flew around the world. When it returned home, it asked its father... "Dad, looking at my first flight, humans applauded my success... they were so nice to me." To which, the father mosquito replied... "They we're not applauding your success... in fact they were trying to kill you, that's why they were applauding," he said. What do you make of the story? We shouldn't trust anyone. You should always be very careful. - Okay, dad. - You should tread cautiously. Once you grow up to be a young man... I'll make you the General Manager of my company. - That's my wish. Will you do it? - Sure, dad. Sleep. Dad, please wake up. Dad! Dad! - Dad! - What is it? What happened? Hey. Dharma! Dharmaraj may have died... but my hard work didn't go in vain. Magic biscuits were very popular in the market. Business grew larger... so did the number of employees. A small bakery turned into a huge factory. Do you know who is the Managing director of the company now? 'Biscuit' "Mighty Tamilan in the grasp of victory" "Is about to rule this world." "You're gracious with your peeps like they're your family" "you shower them generously with love and wealth." "Sharp as the blazing sun, you shine over the people" "basking them in your shadow like a guardian angel." "Mighty as a warrior with the heart of gold" "you're an embodiment of a warrior blessed upon us." Raja was deceived too, just like you people did. Raja is just an employee over there. Dad, you should always be a support to me. Hey, it's going to be fun. Raja, have you heard the news? Hey, he'll take time to finish. It's better you tell me. They're changing the dye machine. We've been given three days leave until its fixed. Let's leave before the management change their mind. - Come on, let's go. - Let go of my hand. Hey, the biscuit is going off the line. - It's making too much noise. - I have no idea. - Ask them check the oil level. - Okay. Once MD arrives, I'll get his approval and send the mail. What happened, Ganesh? Production machine has broke down. So, we've blocked it and ordered a new machine. Ganesh, if we stop production for three days... that'll incur a huge loss to the company. Oh, you think so? Come over here and take a look at this. If we dispatch defective product, company's reputation will be ruined. Ganesh, the problem is not with the machine. The dye is defective. Moreover, we're going to stop this design in three months. It's an unnecessary expense to buy a new machine. You're just a supervisor, stay within your limits. Don't spare your advise to a Senior Manager. Sorry, sir. - You want well-shaped biscuits, right? - Yes. - Give me an hours' time. - Please! Raja, is it fixed? Take a look, hope they're in good shape. Okay, come on, let's go. Hurry up, dude. Boss, you have to give us... give us off. And you're the one who can make it happen. Ganesh, sir, you said we'll be give three days off. Shall we take an extra day as off. - Who said, you're getting off? - You did. Stupid, the dye machine has started working. Get to work. In fact, clock two hours overtime. We should've kept our mouth shut. Raja. Pah! You reek of beer, damn it. Getting high right in the morning. You guys will never learn. - Son. - What is it, dear? I can't bear the toothache. Stop lurking when you have toothache. It's better you stay put. I have to go to the clinic... if you can spare 500 bucks, I'll get to it. I thought you had toothache, but that doesn't hinder you chewing peas. It's better you leave, before I spit on you. Making excuses for money to gamble. Don't you dare, I'll smack you. Oh, really? You can't dare touch me. - I'll smack you damn it. - I dare you. Why do you have to resort to violence at your old age? It's not fair that he's using my underwear. This is my underwear. I've done a lot of things wearing it. - What have you done? - Dance! Is this an underwear or a strainer? It's got too many holes. For such a silly thing, you guys are locking horns with each other. I suggest you guys wear plastics bags instead. Damn! How are you old man? Not great, this knee pain is killing me. I've got you medicines. Shall I help you apply it? Please follow the instructions given by the physiotherapist. Why the hell are you bathing in the kitchen? Don't mock me. My hands are shivering. You were a brat during your childhood... don't waste water when there's scarcity. Here you go, drink using a straw. Give me that. How's your fever? Take these medicines and have fruits. Gran, you can't keep away from cosmetics, is it? - I'm your sister, don't mock me. - Sister? - Take them and distribute in the B block. - Sure. - Check if everything you need is here. - Can you breathe? - Is it hurting? - Sister! - Welcome, Raja. I've been waiting for you. - Good Morning. Jesus is always with you. - You called me about an emergency. - I'll explain. It's interesting. Here you go. I called you, so that you can meet this granny. They found this old woman standing alone at the bus stand near Sivan Temple. She has been staying at that temple for past 2-3 days. Last afternoon, she went to the kids who were playing at the temple... and asked them if they'd like to hear a story. Kids eagerly followed the granny. Suspecting granny's actions, people over there caught her... and inquired about her whereabouts. But the granny didn't utter a word. The people were wondering if they should complain to the police... the roof of the temple came down. Everyone was shell-shocked! Did the granny knew this in prior and was saving the kids from it? Or it was just a coincidence, remains a question. In Bible, they're called, "Guardian Angels." God, to convey the impending danger... uses few signs or prevents them through other human beings. Similarly, she has some kind of divine power. Granny! Gran, where are you from? Raja, I have a small request. Tell me, sister. I'm heading to Vellore in regards to orphanage's land litigation. It'll be great if you could stay the night and take care of the place. I've already arranged for someone. But they can only stay until the evening. - Oh! - So, please... Sister, please don't embarrass me. - Just order me to stay. - But still... - I'll take care of it. - God bless you! Thank you. Thank you. You people must be surprised 'cause of this sudden board meeting. I'm here to share three good news. Raja, I've heard about Sun News and Jaya News... never heard about Good News! Are they planning to start a new channel? We're upgrading our factory as big as this one. It's a 500 crore project. Thank you. Raja, don't you think it's unnecessary? Hey, it's a good thing that we're building a huge factory. It's hard to clean this small factory. How do we maintain such a big factory? May be we can tell them you're finding it hard to clean... and get them to cancel the 500 crore project. Do you think, they'll hear us out? - Oh, no! - Whack him. The second good news. My daughter Leah will be the Vice President of this new factory. This good news... I'm going to choose one among you as the General Manager. That's no one but a person who has worked hard for this company. Has been with us day in and out. A well-wisher of this company. He's been longing to get a good posting. - Dude, he's talking about you. - Thanks, dude. - That's none other than... - Come on, let's go Ganesh! - Yes! - Ganesh? Ganesh, come this side. Thanks everybody. Come on, congratulations! - Take your seat. - Thank you so much, sir. Thanks for the responsibility. I'll definitely keep it up. Raja, come over here. - Ganesh, take Raja in your team. - Sure, sure. - He's very brilliant. - Definitely, sir. Your brilliance has saved the company from spending 200 crores. Keep it up. Thank you, guys. Thanks for coming. Now, everyone get back to work. I'm really sorry, dude. Didn't get you paid yesterday? It's feels awful to see him take your place. What about the old stock? - Clear them all. - Sure, I'll do it. Hey, madam is here. Congratulations, Ms.Vice President. Don't wish me like a politician. Do you know how people wish each other in London? - Are you free in the evening? - What do you have in mind? We're meeting at the Park hotel in the evening. I'm meeting all my college mates. - You have to definitely be there. - Leah, I can't come. You're coming! Enjoy! - Leah, I'm not coming. - See you tonight. Leah! People say, "If God closes one door, he's bound to open another." It works perfectly in your case. I don't get it. Twenty years of your father's hard work... was consumed by Narasimha. Similarly, you gotta consume his 20 years of hard work. Hey, moron! He's not a pill for me to consume. Guide me the right way. Raja, this is definitely the right way. There'll be booze at the party. - You make sure to score her tonight. - Correct! Knuckle head. It's not ethical. Don't you try out clothes before buying. It's just like that. Raja, only if you become MD, we'll get promoted as GM. - There's something you need to remember. - What? Here you go. What do I do with it? When you return from the party, fill it with booze. You were just talking about an upgrade in life. - Soon, you stooped low. - Okay, you don't have to. Hey, what the hell are you wearing? Do you wash these clothes in a washer or a blender? - They're so skimpy. - That's party wear and in trend. I'm throwing a party for becoming the Vice President. Do you like it? It's so loud in here, doesn't your ears hurt? Hi, guys. Meet my childhood friend. - Raja! - Come on, enjoy. - Okay, fatso. - Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Did you study or learn to drink at London? You're gulping it down. Hey, that's how you take a shot. Is that so? So, are you still single or seeing someone? I'm dabbling around. But I'm still single. - Oh! - Okay, now it's your turn. You have to gulp it one go. - Leah, I'm not used to it. - Come on, you can do it. - I don't want. - Hey, hold him down. Hey, lock him down. Hey-- Hey, Leah please hear me out. - Leah! - Come on, Raja, you can do it. It's freaking burning like hell. - Come on, Raja. - You're pouring it like it's medicine. Come on, let's get on to the dance floor. "Let the dance go on forever" "Get drenched in the musical shower" "Bid farewell to deadlines" There'll be booze at the party. You make sure to score her tonight. Leah, what the hell did you do to me last night? Are you looking for this? Here you go. I think it was your first time, last night. It was amazing, you nailed it. It was a unforgettable night. I've never enjoyed so much in my life. My dear sister... I did tell you that we'll get a scapegoat if we party regularly. You didn't believe me. Look at him, we got our scapegoat. Cheers! Shame on you! That's enough, the prank is over. Did you just say, prank? You guys go overboard sometimes. Defects of collaborations. Get out. Get out, damn it. Hey-- hey, no, no. - What is the time? - It's five 'O' clock. How come it's so bright five in the morning? Hey, It's five in the evening. We wrapped up the party six in the morning. Get ready soon. We have to head to another party. They're going to party again? If I keep this going, then my liver will cease to function. - Hello. - Hello, Anitha speaking. Who, Anitha? Nun must've mentioned... I'm waiting for you after my morning shift. When will you be here? I'm leaving. I'll be there in ten minutes. - Hello, please come sooner. - Sure, I'll be there. Damn! Raja has arrived. Hey, that's a nice watch. Did you whisk it from a guy? What? Hey, hello... you were supposed to be here at 5pm. But it's 6pm now, you're one hour late. I have to be somewhere. Listen woman, don't command me like you're my wife. You're accusing me as if I was drunk and couldn't wake up due to hangover. I had too many meetings to attend at the office. You mean to say, I'm jobless? I think you might. You'll either order take out or create tik-tok videos. - Hello! - You're getting a call. Hello... please give the patient medicine to control the blood pressure. Once I get there will check the scan report... and proceed with the treatment. Sorry, I'm running late. I will be there in fifteen minutes. Oh, no. I messed around with a Covid warrior. I'm sorry. I didn't know you are a doctor. Hello, I'm sorry. Please hear me out. - Raja! - Tell me moron. You've messed with the wrong person. You have no idea. She's a very successful doctor. Enough, stop waving your hands. The people at the orphanage are very old. Please be a bigger person and help us. I've told you a million times that it's a ancestral property. The old man just gave his word. It was not registered. His son has original documents with him. He's under debt, so he's selling the property. Both the buyer and the seller are giving me a commission... to vacate the property. Please let me do my job. I'll give you a weeks' time. Vacate the place and get going. Cold breeze and the sky is filled with stars. Beautiful moon though. If only I get to gulp down a peg, it'll be great. Make a wish which suits your age, old hag. Don't ask for too much that you can't take. They're composing tunes through their snores. He's starting from tor and he ends with bur. Whereas he ends with bur and begins with dor. I won't be able to sleep in this noise. Instead, I'll go deaf. Let me go outside. Once there lived a king. - He worried about not having kids. - Who's she telling stories to? - Just then a seer arrived at his kingdom. - The dogs are howling. Granny, to whom are you narrating the story? I'm narrating it to my grandson. Grandson? I don't see anyone over here. He passed long ago. Whenever I think of him... I narrate a story, and that gives me peace. People think I'm crazy. It doesn't matter to me anymore. Gran, don't worry about it. Why don't you consider me as your grandson? So, shall I tell you a story? It's too late for a story. Fine, go ahead. In the greatest Kingdom of Ujjain... there was a place named Hastinapuram. Earthly resources, water resources... it was a nation rich and content with resources. There once lived a King. Just like you. [Praised Sloganeering] Hey, be careful the flowers are hurting my eyes. Just 'cause I called you a King, don't start imagining too much. There was no welcome party. Neither he was accompanied by soldiers. In fact, he didn't even a palanquin. He was a king for namesake. So, even in stories the name "Raja" doesn't weigh much. No, no... he was a potential candidate to become a King. Unfortunately, he's reduced to a commander. Do you know who is the King of that nation? Please sit down. - Commander. - Your Highness. What is the result if you add six and six? It's twelve. If Aaru (river) and Aaru collide, there will be flood. Oh, God, that's hilarious! Oh, no! Commander, why aren't you laughing? Be happy that I didn't smack you with my shoes. Are you speaking against his highness? Hey, fawner. I'm talking to you, damn it. Why are you creating a rift between us? Stop it! For the crime of controlling your laughter... I'm stripping you off the commander's post. Your Highness! Your punishment is to collect horse shit for the next three days. What if the horse doesn't shit? Then he'll have to collect elephant shit. Oh, no! To clear your doubt, you've doubled my punishment. Your Highness, please crack another joke, I'll definitely laugh. This is my command. So, is my decree. I'd rather wipe that shit on your face. Why should I carry his shit? Listen, weren't you punished. Why are you making me do it? There's lots to collect. Stop whining and keep moving. You don't make any sense at all. Why the hell are you smelling it? You should be rightfully ruling the kingdom. It's embarrassing to see your collect shit. It's funny that you don't find your looks embarrassing. But you feel embarrassed 'cause I'm collecting shit. Mottappa! Damn, it's a shame. What the hell are you wearing? Don't even dare to appear in front of Sathyaraj, sir. He'll tear you apart. I don't know what to do. The hair doesn't grow. Instead grow a beard and be content. Or wear this basket on your head. Dude, stop it. Hazard alarm is blaring. It's a war. It's a war. - Help me collect shit, you morons. - Mighty soldiers are on the way. You morons, don't try and evade. Don't run, damn it. It's shame they're soldiers of war. What happened, Minister? Kalakayers has waged a war. Give me that. If you keep looking, it'll scare you. Plan decisively and prepare for war. Nations loomed by locusts and Kalakayers... has always been destroyed. Hey, he's already shit scared. Don't scare him more. Kalakayers are dangerous people. They don't see a difference young or old, but brutally rape them. Is it true? If it's true, are you planning to join the enemy? I'll offer you as sacrifice before we go to war. Respected Ministers, call for an emergency meeting. Inform everyone, it's the King's order. Mottappa, how many soldiers do you need to fight the enemy? Your Highness, I need 500 soldiers. Why do you need 500 soldiers to fall on the enemy's feet? It's enough, if you go alone. Veersimha, care to share an idea. It doesn't matter if it's an army of thousands... Obviously, it doesn't matter 'cause you'll run and hide. It's us, who are you going to be on the front line. - Former commander! - Your Highness... a troop's strength is its commander. If we hack the enemy commander's head... the troops will run haywire. Bravo! That was an interesting idea. Father, let's follow Rajasimha's strategy. Okay, let's follow his strategy. Get all the troops ready for the war. It's the King's command. Get going. Hail your Highness! - Mottappa. - Tell me First let's move the people to safety. I'll send my family away to safety. I'll return soon. - I'll go and wear my underwear. - Hey, morons! - Close the main door. - To hell with it, If I get hurt... - then I can't answer to my 3rd wife. - These guys are hopeless. I am coming It looks like horses are running on a treadmill. It looks like they're coming from the sky. It's even emerging from the ground. It's a new horse brand binoculars. They're unaware it was just a sticker. - Are they close? - Nope they've shrunk. Damn fawner. It was a horse sticker on the new binoculars. You were unaware and got everyone panicked. Instead of preparing for war, you guys are whiling away time. Welcome, Your Highness. Do you know what you're trusted commander has done? You'll speak high of me. It's better I'll speak for myself. I didn't do anything huge. I just wrote a threatening letter... - and sent it across through a pigeon. - You sent a message? They read the letter and ran away. Your Highness, he's lying Let me take a look. Your Highness-- He's an utter fool. I don't see anyone. Has everyone ran away? Your highness, it's right here. Hey, hey... I appreciate your presence of mind. Are you talking about the sticker he chewed on? If he had encountered the enemy, he would've chewed them to pulp. He finished chewing... not sure when he's going to spit it out. - You come this side. - Sure, you too. Bravo! For your bravery... and the way you chased away the enemy. You'll be the successor to my Kingdom. Be ready, tomorrow is your coronation. - Thank you. - Hail, commander. - Your Highness. - Thank you. Gran, humanity has lost its course. Deceit and betrayal has taken over the world. Son, don't think of it like that. Just sit down. I'm yet to finish the story. Do you know what happened during the coronation? Who made the arrangements? It was me, Highness. - How's the banner? - It's fantastic. Fantastic! It's absolutely fantastic. Cut out-- Hey! [Bahubali] Bahubali! Firstly clutch the rope. I'm wearing a mask 'cause of Corona, not to pose as Bahubali. It's Rajasimha! Rajasimha! Bravo, Rajasimha! - Did you see that? - Bravo! Fantastic! Rajasimha! Give me your leg. Hey! Let-- let go of my leg. Hey, I said let go of my leg. Oh, damn. It stinks like shit. It is shit indeed. I was waiting to wipe it elsewhere... but you grazed it on your bald head. Let go of it, it'll stink, damn it. Rajasimha, please stop. Oh, no! Your Highness, I have a request to make. Tell me, Simha! Just 'cause there are banners erected at every nook and corner... it's affecting the people and is a danger to life. It'll be great during your rule, erecting banners should be banned. Moreover, a great ruler doesn't need publicity. A King's duty is to protect the lives of his people. But you've fulfilled it on my behalf. Bravo, Rajasimha! Your highness! I think it's going to rain. Let's finish the coronation ceremony. Patience! Rajasimha, come over here. Rajasimha, you've worked hard for this nation. It's my duty to give you a fair chance. That being said, on my birthday... you two should come up with an idea for the development of this nation. I'll pick the best idea among the two. And that person will be the successor to my kingdom. Until then I'm putting the coronation on hold. Your Highness, you've already declared... This is my command. So, is my writ. Everyone was happy on hearing the King's announcement. And it was raining money. Raining money? Gran, our city is depraved of regular rain. We're dependent on water tankers. Anything can happen in a story. It'll be awesome, if things happen just the way it does in stories. Did you hear the bells ringing? It's the ice cream guy, I owe him money. You please go to bed. - How many times should I repeat it? - MD is calling you Tell them, I'm coming. Don't speak over the phone at work. Hey, they've summoned us for a meeting. Sure, let's go. May I come in, sir! Hey, close the door, damn it. Close the door, damn it. Hey, what's wrong? He's asking us to get inside and then close the door. Get in! Close that door, immediately! Sir, why are you sitting in the dark like a ghost? Shall I switch on the light? No, no... dad just underwent laser surgery. That's why we're holding the meeting in dark. Dude, is this really our company's meeting? Or it is an illicit meeting? Don't hurt me. Baldy, go and get a chair. What was that noise? Be careful, it's dark. Thank goodness, no one knows it was me. It's very dark. Oh, no! - I just said to be careful. Was it Manohar? - Yes, sir. - Hey, get me some water. - Okay, sir. I kept water on the table. That's my head, damn it. - Oh, no! - I regret hiring this moron. Hey, give it to me. What is that noise? Someone's having tobacco. Is that Manohar? Oh, no! That wasn't me. I holding this meeting, 'cause entire nation has been affected with Corona. The stock is piling up and it will incur major loss. I don't what to do. Sir, it's very simple. We'll advertise, if they buy two packs of biscuits, one cream box will come as free. People will be drawn to the offer. That's a great idea. Marketing team, how do you like the idea? It's an awesome idea, will definitely work. Sir, it's a silly idea. This will just clear 50% of the stock. Instead of giving the cream box as free... let's use the cream in between the biscuits and sell them as cream-biscuits. The entire stock will be sold. Hey, this sounds even better. What nonsense, sir? Cream-biscuit is an old idea. It's a great idea to get rid of the stock without spending extra. Marketing team, how's the idea? Okay, sir. Follow Raja's idea and start working. Raja, please sit down. You've worked hard for this company. But I've never appreciated you. I'm going to give you a chance. In order to develop our new factory... prepare a plan and make a presentation on my birthday. I'll pick the best among the two presentations... and promote them as the General Manager. Sir, you did declare that I'm the GM during the board meeting. It was me who declared, right? And now I'm changing it. You can go. - Sir! - What is it? - Sir, please give me your hands. - Here you go. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much, sir. - Okay. - Thanks, sir. Hello. Road accident at Chromepet bridge ATM cash vehicle Send recovery van urgently - Sir, sir... - Please help us. Sir, please help us with it. Please pick up the money. Hey, Lakshmi, look it's raining money. I'm already on it. It was raining money. Raining money? Gran, our city is depraved of regular rain. We're dependent on water tankers. Anything can happen in a story. It's crisp new currency. Pick them all, no one else should get it. See, it is flying Hey, gold coin Take it He was a potential candidate to become a King. Rajasimha, you've worked hard for the sake of this nation. It's my duty to give you a fair chance. That being said, on my birthday... you two should come up with an idea for the development of this nation. I'll pick the best idea among the two. And that person will be the successor to my kingdom. It'll be awesome, if things happen just the way it does in stories. You've worked hard for the sake of this company. But I've never appreciated you. I'm going to give you a chance. In order to develop our new factory... prepare a plan and make a presentation on my birthday. I'll pick the best among the two presentations... and promote them as the General Manager. Gran's stories are coming true. - Granny! - Raja has arrived. - Hey... Raja has arrived. - Don't rush me... - you guys are behaving like monkeys. - What did you get us? We never knew you loved us so much. You got everything for us... - granny might be upset, you know. - Yeah, right. Didn't you get anything for gran? Gran is not going to be upset, but you guys. Because, I got everything for granny. - Give it back. - Oh, damn, it's all gone. What's in your hand? - An empty cover. - You can keep that. Granny! Gran, it's all yours. Eat all you want and tell me a fun-filled story. No Raja, I'm busy reading a biography on a saint. I don't have time to tell you a story. The stories you demand can only be narrated during the night. Not now. So, it has to be night. Hold on a moment. It's night now, get to bed, damn it. It goes for you too, get to bed, damn it. Look, it's night now. Everyone has started to sleep. It does look like night. Please tell me a story. I always narrate stories to my grandson during the night. I can't tell you a story now. Gran, what do you expect me to do until the nightfall? - Keep waiting! - I'll break your jaw. Enough Raja, you go to bed. Gran, how can I sleep? You promised to tell a story. Oh, yeah, you did ask for a story. There's no need for a story... we're really tired. Switch off the lights and get to bed. If you're tired, you get to bed. Why the hell are you striking weird poses? - Shall I drown in the pond? - I can't bear the cold. Oh, God! He turns the day into night and forces us to sleep. And during the night he's killing us by not letting us sleep. - Shut down that barking radio. - Oh, no! Gran, you please go ahead. In our country after the rule of Britishers... the hereditary of Royals were destroyed. The only royal who survived hailed from Chinnamannur. The land and estates that royal owned... was managed by a granny who belonged to their family. Three men conspired to kidnap that granny. Cut, cut, cut, cut! - The story is no good. - This story won't work out. You're right. Gran, you don't take their reviews seriously. The story you just narrated is awesome. I'm totally fine with the kidnapping. Shall we make a small change in the story? What? Shall we replace the granny with a young girl? Sounds amazing! Now, that girl has been kidnapped by a gang. Lift her - Get going, before the driver arrives. - Let go of me, damn it. Help! The girl's father is in great distress, 'cause his daughter has been missing. No! Someone has kidnapped my daughter. Hope I'm on the right track, gran? Don't stress too much, gran. I'm on track and the flow is right. What follows next... I'll tell you. This is where our Hero makes an entry. Hey, shit ball! He can come through the door, why does he have to enter breaking glass? A hero demands theatrics. Why did you summon me? Usually, madam returns home before the lights are on. But today, she hasn't returned yet and it's past the routine time. That's why we're worried. I don't see any confusion in this matter. You can switch on the lights once your madam returns home. Can't believe you called me for this. Bullet Raja! I doubt that my daughter has been kidnapped by someone. - Has anyone called yet? - No. Then, let's wait. Sir! - Are you heading over there? - Yes. Please pass on this cup to him. - Sir, you're heading over there, right? - Yes Please pass on this biscuits to him. - You fool! - Oh, no! I am annoyed already Come on. Enough of staring, pick up the phone. Mr.Narasimhan! Untie me. Let go of me. Raja, I have no idea who's on the phone. But he's been continuously laughing. That confirms he's the kidnapper. Here I come. Hello! Leave me It's evident now, that you're the kidnapper. Please don't waste your time on laughing. Get to the point. Sounds like you're choking. Drink some water. We've kidnapped the girl, you've been looking for. - Talk to her. - Hello... - Raja! - Hello. - Leah! - Hello, Raja. Don't be scared. - I'm not scared Raja. - That was for your dad. - Leah tell me where are you? - Raja-- No matter how much you try, you can't find our den. It's better you get a million in cash... and head over to the foundation of Parangimalai. I'll be there right away. How long will it take you to get there? We'll be there in ten minutes. So, that mean your hide out is in Meenambakkam. Boss, he figured our hide-out. Useless moron, give me the phone. He was bluffing. It will take three hours for us to get there. Don't be late, 'cause I figured it out. - Damn! - Get the girl and come sooner. I'll meet you there with money. Raja, your life might be in danger 'cause of the kidnappers. It's best I go there and bring Leah back home. No. Keeping your debts in mind, you can't be trusted with money. It's better I go. He found it correctly Hero is walking into a plot twist he's unaware of. Hey, hands up! Sir, please don't shoot. We're here to poop. It's wrong to have crashed the action block site. And you're here pooping as a couple. - You-- - Oh, no, sir! Hey, pull down your lungi and run. - Sure, will do. - Damn! Black cap, holding a briefcase in hand. I think he's the guy I'm supposed to meet. Egg came first or the chicken? In fact it arrived on a truck from Namakkal. Are you an egg vendor? Billa! King of smuggling. David Billa! Hey, I'm here to exchange the briefcase. You should've checked before buying it. Is it damaged or what? Hey! Police! Let's run. Run faster, you're going to get us caught. Let go. Let go of me. Raja, how dare you brought the Police along. Hey, I didn't bring them along. They're here to arrest, Billa. You'll get only this girl's dead body now. Kill that girl, damn it. Hey, Leah! He can't do squat about it. - Chandru, put her inside the car. - Raja! - Leah. Hey, hear me out. - Escape! Hey-- Hey, Leah. Hey! - Raja! - Leah! Raja! - Raja - Leah. Billa escaped, but Kazhugu got caught How was the plot twist? It's my time to settle score. Now, there's no chance the hero can save the heroine. Doesn't matter if he'll save her or not. Let's see who'll save you from me. - Oh, no! - You're spoiling the story. You better sleep on the porch. Don't come inside. It's really cold out here. - Cover yourself with sack. - Oh, no! Everyone is barging in and spoiling the story. Let's disregard their stories. Hero steps in fights the bad guys and saves the heroine. Okay, right? - I meant to-- - That's an okay. Only then, things will happen according to my plan. - Raja! - Don't scream. Chandru, drive faster. Raja! Come on, go faster. He's blinding me with the mirrors Don't stop keep driving faster. You moron, get down. Hey, stop right there. Don't try to runaway. Fight him! Hey, someone please step forward and fight. Leah! Raja. Leah! Sky. Earth. Here comes the knock! Leah. I'm holding it, why don't you bend down and escape? Leah... Leah. Now, her father will come over there... rewards the hero with wealth, position and get her daughter married to him. How does it sound? Gran, acknowledge the story. Please say, okay. Okay, right? Uh, so, it's okay. Where did he vanish? Hey, hey, hey! Bullet Raja, you saved my daughter from a grave danger. I have faith that you'll take good care of my daughter. So, I've decided to get my daughter married to you. Uh, uncle, you've forgotten the main aspect here. I believe I gave you everything. Those are my father's company documents. All of my wealth is in here. Most importantly, you're the boss of Magic Biscuit Factory. Take this as well with my daughter How was the story, gran? Did you like it? Only if you acknowledge, it'll come true. Are you okay with it? I'm double, okay! - Then, it's okay for me too. - Yes! Gran, acknowledge the story. Everyone get to bed. Oh, God! What about me? You can use your hand as pillow. Gran, put this pillow under your leg. Hope you're comfortable. Yes! Tomorrow, everything will come true and I will be owner of my company. Are you sure about Leah getting kidnapped? - It's confirmed. - Okay. Why do you need this build- up at the cost of petrol? Dude, it's imperative 'cause we're going to be in a chase. It's been long. And they're not to be seen. It's not cinema for them to keep up timing. Poor kidnappers. It's hard to kidnap someone. Why are you feeling sorry for the kidnappers? Yes. Because they're going to change my fate. Then, what about our fate? Your fates are rotten. Don't worry, I'll take care of you guys. - Raja, Raja, Raja! - Uh, Leah! I'm coming. Hey, what happened? It ran out of gas, due to continuous revving. - Moron. Dude, I'm coming with you. - Hop on! Dude, ride faster. Madam, don't be scared. We'll save you. Come on, go faster. Bump him off the road. Do it! Dude, my head is scraping. Hey, stop the bike. Damn it, my head is scraping the road. - Leah! - Look over here, he's smudged into balloon. - Did you my owner's daughter? - I saved you. Ask your dad to get the documents. - I'll explain later. - Hey! Hey, instead of kick him down, you're talking to him. Hold on, it's our boss. Hey, why would I kidnap my own daughter? In fact, we got a message that another group is about to kidnap her. So, there's a group involved too. Who informed you guys? It was Raja, who informed us. What is this, Raja? Boss, it was Leah who kept screaming my name. I saw you standing so just called out your name. Hey, she just called you. Did she ever ask you to come and break the glass? What the hell is this mess? Hey, what the hell is he doing here? Guys, you left me stranded with no money for gas. Boss, as we saved you and your daughter from the kidnappers... what are you going to reward us with? So, this was extensively planned? You want a reward, right? Here you go. Fix the car and bring it home. Come on, let's go. The other day, the story came true. How come it didn't happen this time? Okay, sir. - What happened? - Granny is missing. Raja, granny had gone to temple with three people. But she got lost in the crowd. I'm really scared, Raja. Three men conspired to kidnap that granny. So, only the stories said by granny comes true. If that's the case, who kidnapped, granny? - Gran, didn't go missing. - I don't get it. Why are you staring at us? Didn't you guys take gran to the temple? Are you accusing us? Humanity has lost its course. Here you go, the prayer ticket. Check for yourself. And this is temple's offering. And this is the restaurant bill where we had lunch. These are the tickets from our travel. Take a look. Take a good look. Take a closer look, as you don't trust us. It's more than enough. You've booked four tickets while going to the temple. But you've booked only three tickets for the return travel. - Are you serious? - Oh, no! So, you knew before hand that gran will go missing. Looks like your half baked plan got exposed. - Why the hell did you do it? - It's all 'cause of you. You pamper granny, but look down on us. You do everything for granny. Remember how you took away pillow to rest gran's legs. Where did you leave her behind? I'll take you to her. Granny! - Granny! - Raja, gran is out there. - Granny! - Ah... Raja. Thank goodness, you're here. The three men who came along with me... asked me to wait here, until they return. It's been very long. Not sure where they went. Poor thing, please go and look for them. Granny. Gran, I'll take care of them. Hereafter, you shouldn't leave anywhere without informing me. Sure, I will inform you. You too shouldn't leave me forever. I won't, gran. I definitely, won't. Where's our hero? Sir, he's right over there. Okay. Hello, sir. Good morning, sir. I heard you chased down the car to save Leah... just 'cause she called out your name. Come on, don't laugh. He was being heroic. Sir, looks like you're planning something. Do you care to share with us? Boss, had mentioned to display ones' skills. That explains his heroism. Oh, you're competing for the GM's post, is it? If you become the General Manager... please take me as your assistant, sir. Hey, when the wind blows... the paper flies so does a bird. Only when the wind subsides... one can spot the difference between a paper and a bird. I hope you understood the analogy. Hey, it's better you come, do you work... and take home your share of leftover biscuits. If you wish to compete for the GM's post... I'll tarnish you. Mind it. Get back to work! For gastric troubles... add ginger and cumin seeds. What do we do, if infants suffer from bad stomach? You gotta wipe their asses. Didn't you know that already? Grandma, you please go ahead. Hello Doctor program has come to an end. We'll meet Dr.Anita at the same time tomorrow. Greetings and Thank you. You can leave now. Grandma, he's being difficult. Son, give that to her. She needs information on country medicine to attend an exam. That's why I was helping her out. Gran, please be careful. She might make you a proxy to write her exams. You can stare all you want outside. I'm here to listen to a story. You've been nagging like a child to hear a story. Don't you have a presentation to complete? Why don't you prepare for it? Why is doctor going too sweet on me? Uh, it's not like it seems. I just felt like saying it. - When life gives you an opportunity.. - Good night. - Hear me out.. - Good night. - Let me speak.. - Goodnight. Good night. Good night, grandma. Grandma, let's get to our story time. Everyone gather around. Gran is about to tell a story. Hey, moron! Why the hell are you gathering people? Look at this idiot, trying to peep in. You guys have done enough damage. Get lost. Hereafter, it's one- to- one. Gran, will tell the story and I'll hear it. Grandma, come on, let's go out. Oh, no, why do you have to? Grandma, please watch your step. Oh, God! She hasn't lost her charm. Grandma, please narrate a beautiful love story. In that story, heroine falls in love with the hero. That love rewards the hero with everything he has wished for. - Love story, is it? - Yes. During the 12th century... there lived a beautiful princess in Rome. She had a warrior as her bodyguard. This Kyron warrior is at your service. You can ask anything of me. Princess, the Persian King is here to meet you. Who the hell is he? Looks like a bloated mannequin. What brings you here? We need water. You came all the way for water? You could've just bought a packet at the corner store. We're not here for the drinking water. On his way over here, his stomach got upset. It's hard to believe that Persian King has an upset stomach. Doesn't who it is, junk food upsets the stomach. Agreed! Can you or not give us water? We will give you water. Don't get angry. So, shall we give it to him? Or shall we knock them down? Knock them down, indeed. Kyron warriors don't bow down to authority. You made a huge mistake! You've insulted the Persian King. We're going to wage a war against your kingdom. - Hercules! - Hey, get lost from here. Damn you warriors, the issue could've been solved with a bucket of water. But you've dragged a nation to war. The Persian King was humiliated... so he planned to attack the Princess of Rome. Do you know how the Princess rewarded the brave warrior? What did she give him? Tell me what was it? She did! Grandma..! - Book, is it? - Yes, she gave him a book. I really don't understand your angle. Have you never seen any romantic films? I've seen few during my childhood. The Casanova! This situation doesn't call for a book. That wasn't an ordinary book. Is it a bound one? That was her gift of love. King of Rome! King of Justice! Guardian of the people. A noble and generous philanthropist. Wish you a long life. - Here you go. - Thank you. Hercules, he looks like someone who came straight outta garbage. I wonder how he's got such a beautiful daughter. Kyron, beauty has to be savored. Shouldn't criticize it. For instance, this apple was picked up from trash. It still tastes good. What do you say, Marco- Polo? He's just pretending to spit. But has been swallowing it. Thief! In order to develop the Roman Empire... I had asked for suggestions from everyone. Does anyone have a plan in mind? I do, Highness. Your Highness, this books carries, warfare, medicine and public welfare moreover it has everything required for the development of an empire. So, it's just one? I'm here too. Kyron warriors don't exaggerate things. I'm submitting this book on behalf of Kyron warriors. It's really heavy, please take it from my hand. After going through both the books... the person who's suited to run this empire. Morpheus! - Morpheus! - No. Kyron! No, it's Kyron! I'm handing over my empire to Kyron... also I'm giving my daughters' hand in marriage. Come closer! What? What happened? Oh! Isn't this leftover apple, right? Long live! He got the empire 'cause of the book given by the Princess. Also he got to marry the princess. How's it? Grandma, you're awesome. This is what I wanted. - I'm leaving. - Hey, sit down. I'm yet to finish the story. What is left to say? On his first day as the King, he removed all the old people from there. King of Rome! King of Justice! Guardian of the people. A noble and generous philanthropist. Wish you a long life. Apologies, I have nothing to offer. A King can't refuse. Shall I make a mark on your face? It's high time you change your attitude. Your Highness, you were right about him. - Who are you? - I'm the Statecraft Minister. Stand up right away. He's taking too much time. What is your age? This August, I'll be 67 years old. I doubt you'll last until August. And you've been shamelessly warming up benches. Hereafter, people above 60 years old shouldn't be in Kyron. Ask all the old people to leave the country. Your Highness, how can we leave at once? If given prior notice, would you have gone to United States? Now tell me, what is with your head? It looks like a knife sharpener. Hercules, clear out all the old hags. Okay. - Hey, leave from here. - Where do we go? We're old. - Fine, we're going. - Get out, damn it. - Don't come back. - Hercules! How old are you? Your Highness, I’m 60 years old. No, I'm 50 years old. In fact, I'm 40 years old. It's better you leave the nation too. - Your Highness! - Get out, I say. Kyron Warriors! - It's not right. - That's how stories are. The good becomes bad. The bad becomes good. Only then it gets interesting. I really don't get your stories. You always mess up the climax. How can you turn a hero into villain? Grandma, please consider and change the climax. Raja, I can't change the story to suit your liking. Goodnight, I'm very sleepy. Grandma! - Grandma! - Don't wake me up. I'm done for the day. Go and sleep. I hope you can sell the entire stock by tomorrow. It'll be cleared for sure. Don't worry about it. I don't have to worry. You'll have to, if you don't clear the stock. I'll pass on the order to someone else. - No, madam, I'll clear it. - We'll see. Wow! Hey, surprise. I was about to call you. What's on your neck? There's going to be a huge action scene out here. After which it's going to get mushy. I really don't get your jokes. Come over here. For a while, I've been wanting to tell you something. Is it about love? - How did you know? - It's all in the game. Go ahead. But I'm quite scared of dad. You don't worry about your dad. Status wouldn't be an issue. It all happened after I got back from London. I always wanted to tell you. But you always had company. Now that no one is here, tell me. In Bangalore... I have a boyfriend. Boyfriend? - Then who am I to you? - You're my friend. You kissed me. I did. Kiss on the cheeks, is a friend. Kiss on the lips, is a boyfriend. Lips and cheeks are close to each other. Kiss me on the lips and make me your boyfriend. Idiot, everything is a joke to you. I'm heading to Bangalore to celebrate his birthday. If dad asks for me, please make an excuse and handle it. Leah! Leah, it doesn't matter if you don't love me. At least give me the book, which will make me the owner of the company. Hey, why are you standing in middle of the road? Situation calls for it. What is this? What brings your here? I'm here for a medical camp. But why are you dressed all in white? It's the dress code. I have a seminar at noon. Buddy, look at that girl in white. Oh, no! Let's throw the colour to her Please don't do it. I'm go to seminar Please don't do it. - I have a seminar to attend. - Get inside the car. Raja, please Thank you. Okay, you go safe. Just wait for a minute. What is this book? To help you with your project presentation. That was not an ordinary book. Hey! I said, get down. Hey, can't you hear, damn it. Will you or not give us water? - Move aside. - Are you blind? They deserve to get water too. That was her gift of love. - So, it's you. - I don't get it. Are you my beloved Princess? Only now you've realized it? Kiss on the cheeks, is a friend. Kiss on the lips, is a boyfriend. "Baby you gotta accept me." "Please, you gotta take me in." "I'm your honey, my dear." "And you're my Queen, dear." "Baby you gotta accept me." "Please, you gotta take me in." "I'm your honey, my dear." "And you're my Queen, dear." "Our hearts have come together as one." "And you've approved and signed up for what we are." "Our hearts have come together as one." "And you've approved and signed up for what we are." "Baby you gotta accept me." "Please, you gotta take me in." "I'm your honey, my dear." "And you're my Queen, dear." "You've smitten me with your smile and your cute antics." "You've rolled me up like a crepe drenched with love." "I was a hardcore single." "But you've flipped me into a love bug." "I thought of stealing you away and keeping you for myself." "Baby you gotta accept me." "Please, you gotta take me in." "I'm your honey, my dear." "And you're my Queen, dear." "Your eyes are mesmerizing just like the doughnuts I love." "Don't you be rough on me and push me away, dear." "You're taking me down like the mighty Gin." "If you call me with love, I'll lay curled under your feet." "Nothing comes easy, you gotta work for it." "I'm your unconditional lover, I'm gonna lift up your spirits." "Baby you gotta accept me." "Please, you gotta take me in." "I'm your honey, my dear." "And you're my Queen, dear." "Our hearts have come together as one." "And you've approved and signed up for what we are." "Our hearts have come together as one." "And you've approved and signed up for what we are." Thank you. So, biscuit is not a staple diet. It's a kind of entertainment. The reason why I'm mentioning it... 'cause the appearance of the biscuit matter the most. Before satisfying the taste buds... if we make it attractive to eyes, our job is done. The current generation is addicted to gaming and mobile phones. We have to get them addicted to our Magic Biscuits. So, we're going to add more sweeteners and coloring agents. And more emulsifiers. These additives will affect kids health. Ma'am we're running a biscuit factory not a hospital. You're concern for health is unhealthy for the business. Our competitors are way ahead of us in the game. And coming to your concern, what we could do is... basically we can add a small disclaimer behind the biscuit packet. That's about it. Our budget for advertisement should be more than production. Appearance of the product is key to sales. Flashy foods, fruitful business. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. - How was it? - Raja, you proceed. Good morning. Back in the day there food and medicine were not different things. In fact worked as medicine. The snacks and savories our grandmothers made... comprised of extremely nutritious and healthy ingredients. The food back then worked perfectly as country medicine. Let's get back to our roots. Let's stop using the white flour for making biscuits... and start using maize, rye etc to manufacture them. Firstly they discover a medicine. Then a disease is invented to sell that medicine. And for people to catch that disease, they manufacture new type of foods. Let's not mirror an international company in trapping people... by producing unhealthy foods. Rather let's become a traditional company that produces healthy foods... and saves people from not catching a disease. To put it in simple words... let's just tweak the food our grandmothers used to feed us. Let's turn this junk food into . healthy snack... and create magic. What the heck. Well done, Raja. Right time you well spoke I thought it's going to be tough... to pick one as the General Manager. But it turned out easy. Ganesh... your idea was definitely larger than life. But, Raja... you were very natural about your idea. Youngsters these days favor organic food. Even the parents choose to feed the same to their children. My friend, Dharmaraj. Founder of this company. If he was alive today. Raja, he would've definitely appreciated you. So... Ganesh! Your idea won't work out. You stay put. Raja, please come. From today, Raja will be your General Manager. I thank everyone present here. - Raja, let's go to your cabin. - Sure, sir. Sir, based on this post, I've taken loans. I'll take care of it. Hold your horses. - Let's go. - Please, sir. Hey, your book did wonders to my career.. - Congrats! - Hey, thanks. Why do you have your hands in the air? I was about to give you a hug. But Leah barged in... So, you think I barged in, is it? Leah, she's my girlfriend. Then what do you have to say about this? They're rock hard. Looks like you're working out. I ran a test in the morning. You're going to be a father. Leah, stop kidding. It was you, who was playing with me last night. And now you're asking me not to play around. You're a doctor, right. Check my pulse. Hey, just 'cause she said, you don't have to. Oh, so you don't believe me. Coming 30th, I'll come with a doctor's report. Then you can decide to love him or not. What shall we name the kid? Anitha! Anitha Raja. Nice name. Hey, Leah! I did not suggest the name. I was just calling out your name. Let's take a call on the 30th. There's no 30th in February. She was just pulling your leg. And you believed her. I trust you. It's not audible, come a little closer. Raja, he's out there. Let's go. I'll be right there. I have a small job to tend to. You carry on. - Manohar! - Why are you calling out everyone? Look over there. I'm surprised how did this happen. - Why do we have to do this now? - Just shut up. They should've at least looked at the presentation. - Boss! - It's in detail. Do you remember what you said about air, paper and birds? I hope now you must've realized who's who? - Let's go. - Yes. Paper! You do respond to that name. I think this name suits you well. Paper! Hey, what was that? It's a naming ritual which we follow. That's right. I remember you saying something else too. He asked you to hire him as your assistant. In this new project, you're going to be my assistant. Tomorrow get to the factory construction site... and begin the required process... then prepare the schedule and bring it to my office. No, you don't have to bring it to me. I don't like to see your face. So, just mail me. - Guys, let's enjoy. - Yes. Damn, we have to endure their atrocities. Can you tell me, where is No.5 Anderson Bungalow? Thirty years ago, it was called Anderson Bungalow. But now it's called Isabella Old Age Home. Oh, please open the gate. This is where Raja gives biscuits That's perfect granny. I'm happy. Ma'am aren't you Raja sir's girlfriend? When did this happen? Who are you? I'm Raja sir's assistant. Can you spare me some glue? I have to stick a court's notice. What notice is this? We're going to bulldoze the orphanage in two days. That's why our office has issued... a small notice to vacate this place. Are you serious? Does Raja know about this? It was Raja's order to bulldoze the place. In fact after becoming GM, this is the first order he signed on. Raja would never do that. We know about Raja's nature. They're right. If something goes wrong with us... Raja is the first person to be here. - Can't believe you're speaking ill of him. - That's right. Sir, is on the phone. Good afternoon, sir. Have you reached the site? I'm on the job, sir. I don't what you would do... make sure you vacate everyone from there, okay? In two days we'll have to demolish and hand it over to the builders. - Understood? - Absolutely, sir. Sure, sir. Hope you heard him over the phone. I'm being respectful of your age. By dawn vacate the orphanage and find some place to crash. Get moving. I'll take a leave. Excuse me, I'm here for Dr.Geeta. - Oh, thanks. - I need that patient's report right away. Good morning, doctor. - Why aren't you answering my calls? - Please leave. I don't wish to speak to you. Anitha! Anitha, please stop. Anitha, I swear I wasn't aware. Is that so? Why don't cancel the order to demolish the orphanage? Then you can come and meet me. Hey, hear me.. Raja, sign this document. I wanted to discuss about the factory. Hereafter, demolishing the orphanage... and construction of the new factory. You'll have to take care of it. Dad and I are headed to Japan to purchase new machinery. Dad has decided to give you the power of attorney for that land. This is that document, please sign it. Sir, is it vital for us to build a factory by demolishing the orphanage? Is the corporation giving you a hard time? Sir, that orphanage is a shelter to the homeless. If we demolish it, they'll have nowhere to go. Please think about it. Look, I felt pity and promoted you as the GM. And you're here feeling sorry for them. I spent a lot to get that land. This is my dream project. If everyone is dead, the land will be orphaned. And you don't want me to demolish it. Look... if you can't do it, I'll promote someone else who's ready to do it. It's not just my dream... it's your father's dream too. Are you going to fulfill your father's dream... or going to run behind these old hags? Think about it. I'm going to turn this bakery into a huge company. And once you're all grown up, I'll make you the GM of our company. That's my dream, will you do it? Okay, dad. Fine, your wish. Don't do it what did you thought Sir, hold on. I'll do it. Hey, make sure nothing is left out. Throw everything away. Hey, who's that? Get out. He removed all the old people from the nation. - Go! - Please spare us, son. Oh, no. I'll inform you after clear it Isn't it wrong? That's how stories are. The good becomes bad. And the bad becomes good. That's when it gets interesting. Move. Demolish it. Come on, over here. Hey! We were together for so many years. But you're being atrocious and chasing us away. - Don't do it. - Hey! Don't demolish it. Please don't demolish it. - Please don't demolish it. - Granny, calm down. Hey, Kumar bring the stretcher around. Where's the patient? Where's the patient? Why are you in such a hurry? Sir, Narasimhan has fainted... I got a call that he's in a serious condition. Who the hell are you calling a patient? I am that Narasimhan, damn it. I think you got the wrong address. I wonder why Raja called me, then. Is it Raja? One second. Speak to him. - Raja. - Tell me, sir. Why did you send an ambulance to my house? Once you hear me out, you'll definitely be in serious condition. Stop kidding around. Have patience. Remember you gave me the power of attorney on the orphanage? I used that power... and got that place registered to the orphanage. Are you serious? The registration was done successfully. Hereafter, neither you... nor anyone can do squat about it. Thanks a lot, Raja. Hey, that was a 500 crore project. I'm feeling really feeling light headed now. Hey, ask them to get the stretcher. I'm at the right address, you were just holding it in. Hurry up, get me the stretcher. Hey, come on take him inside the ambulance. - Hello. - Did you drop the phone? Not just the phone, the entire body fell on the ground. He was too arrogant. He face looks like a crushed paper cup. Oh, no, I thought he'll get a stroke. It's true that God always has a plan for us. One more thing, he's not pleasant to look at... I'm sure it's an ugly sight. - Take him right away to the hospital. - Okay. Hey, pick up that man. Keep moving. Throw everything outside. - Hurry up. - Keep moving. Come on, demolish it. Take the left. - Hello. - Hello, Ganesh... we've registered the land to the orphanage. You don't have to demolish it. Stop everything right now. Hey, move to the other side. - Keep demolishing it. - Ganesh, can you hear me? - Hello? - Hello? - Hello? - Hello, Ganesh, can you hear me? - Ganesh, stop demolishing it. - Sir, I can't hear you. - Ganesh, stop everything. - I can't hear you, sir. Hello, I can't hear anything, sir. - I can't hear you. - Hello, hello, Ganesh? Hello! - Please stop it. - Demolish it. They've demolished it completely. - Please don't do it. - Stop demolishing it. Don't destroy our home. Please listen to us. Please don't do this. Oh, God, no! - Please don't demolish it. - Hey, leave from here. - Hey, stop screaming. - Make sure he doesn't get here. I'll take care of it. He switched off the phone. I'll handle this. You go and get the document. Sir..sir Boys, beat him to pulp. Oh, no Who are you? You look like a buffalo on stand. What's your problem with me? The orphanage. Don't demolish it. Hey! - Raja. - Stop it. Stop it. I said, stop it. - Ma'am. - Stop it. Stop the work What you're doing is illegal. Raja has registered the place to the orphanage. Ma'am, but we're almost done. Please leave. Damn! Hereafter you won't have any problems. Raja is the best. Raja. Are you happy? Come on, let's pick up our stuff. Let's take everything inside. Come on, hurry up. Come on, Raja has arrived. Sorry! I don't know what I did What you did was correct. There's no point in making them homeless and build a factory. Factory can be constructed anywhere. That's not it. The money dad gave, I'll return that as soon as possible. Cool, relax. Thanks a lot, Leah. I did teach you how to thank in London style. Sir, you're currently in Tamilnadu. It's enough that you follow our culture. My dear Tamil woman, you don't have anything to worry about. I'm just a business partner. You're his life partner. Raja, please treat us with marriage feast. Does early morning 4am works for you? We're not getting married now. We're going to date for six months. That sounds great. Please bless us, granny. Gran, tell me a story. Story is it? It's said elders are God's equal. Elders blessings change the course of my son's life. Despite skilled doctors at work... they could not save, Narasimhan. So, Magic Biscuits full control was under my son. Just like I had dreamt, my son became the GM of my company.
