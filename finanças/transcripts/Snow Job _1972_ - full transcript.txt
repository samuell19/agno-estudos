Hey, vito! Hey. Buon giorno, Christian. Come sta? Good... But my ski... I have meant to fix this. What's the matter? Having trouble? My binding is loose. You have a screwdriver in your snow cat, don't you? [Speaking Italian] Come on, we'll get it. Gentlemen... Antonio. Good morning. Ciao. Vito: Christian, where's your girl? At the apartment? For the moment. You like the snow better than the bed, huh? Buon giorno. Si, signore. Buon giorno. Hey, vito, what do you lose first, skiing or sex? Ha! Ask an old man. Come on. I got the screwdriver... Man: All right, what's your company? Second man: Look, I can't even get-- third man: We have 4 applicants. ...isn't any way to get to the other side. Ah. 30 milione. All right. Thanks, vito. [Speaking Italian] All right, Carlo. Andiamo. How many millions would you say your father has? In lire, in francs, or in dollars? What's the difference? A million of anything is plenty. Well, it wouldn't interest you. He doesn't keep it in a truck, and it's not cash, but, uh...Maybe one million, or 2. It's good being rich, huh? Oh, not all good. You never know who your friends are. Well... If you didn't drive such a fancy sports car and didn't wear such expensive clothes, maybe nobody would know you're rich. That's difficult. I like my car, and I like my clothes. Where did you go this morning? Skiing. Where else? At 6:00 in the morning, when I'm here? It's the best time. The snow is fresh, and I can do it. I made it from the top in 4 minutes and 10 seconds. Hmm. The robbery fantasy again. Do you know how long I waited, rolling back and forth to keep both sides of the bed warm? Ha! [Bedsprings creak] It's still warm. Why did you wait until now? Just to see if I could get you into my criminal fantasies. Yes... You could. [Wolf whistle] Beautiful lady. Uh-huh. That's nice. Bella, eh? E Bella. Come on, play! May I help you? Buon giorno, Chris. It's time for work. Buon giorno. May I help you? Morning, everybody. Hey. Buon giorno, Chris. How's it going, champ? Very well. And you? Come to work any later-- you're short again, ah? Well, at the school I was told that I was going to meet my ski instructor here. They seem to be somewhat... Busy on something. Yes. It's something of a tradition on Monday morning. They don't work until 9:00 in the morning, you see. Will you be needing to rent some equipment? No, no, no. I just buy what I need. Wait a minute, I got this... Buon giorno. E Bella. I'm donato massatini, your ski instructor. Good morning. I'm Lorraine borman. I'm looking for a ski instructor. Well, I'd love to, ma'am, but, uh... He's got the first number. Will you help me to schlep my skis? Like I was trying to tell you-- good! Thank you. You won't mind, will you? Well! Why...Why didn't you tell her you had no time? We have rules! What can I tell you, donato? She thinks i'm prettier than you. Is it difficult learning to ski? It depends on the person. How do you think I'd do? I don't know. I haven't known you that long. I have very strong thighs. Will that help? It could. Here. Feel them. They're pretty tight, all right. I told you. I'm firm all over. Is that a fact? I hate flabby bodies, don't you? Definitely. You look pretty solid. I'm hard as a rock. You should feel my pecs sometime. Ooh, I'd love that. Ha ha! Oh, things are good, but the snow is getting very thin. Yes, very soon. Well, it always ends. Anyway, here is the point: We may need a couple of guns. I think I found the guy. Yes. He's American. [Playing folk music] Hey, Bob. Donato sounds jealous. He said he'd run over your face. Run over my face. Is that what he said? I think he'd be glad to run over whatever part of you he can. He just wants that 100,000 lire like everybody else. Is it worth it? For 100,000 lire, I'd almost let him run over my face. Can't pay your laundry, huh? It's getting close. It doesn't matter, though. I'm going home, Christian. You are leaving? I've been doing this for 5 years. Every season, I end up with nothing. I'm gonna go home and go back to school... Get a job. Sounds great, doesn't it? Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to the third annual cervinia snowmobile race! [Crowd applauding] Announcer: Each driver goes 5 times around this course. To the winner goes 100,000 lire, plus... This little baby of champagne. [Cheering] Gentlemen... Start your engines! [Engines revving] 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Go! [Crowd cheering] Keep out of the way! Aah! Hey, you! Get out of the way, donato! Go home! Donato, get out-- what are you trying to do? You chickenshit son of a... [Crowd applauding] [Band strikes up] First, donato massatini! Second, Julio quintos! Ladies and gentlemen, Julio! Come on. We'll buy you a drink. And third, tomaso brinna! [Singing in Italian] What's 1/3 of 1/4 million? Why? You have seen the money truck that goes up to the lodge, haven't you? Sure. You're trying to tell me they got $80,000 in that? No. A quarter of a million. 150 million lire. Horsepucky. What did you say? Horsepucky. What? It means they've never even seen that much money up here. Woman: Ha ha ha! No. They have. They do. Every week of the season. I've figured it out. You've figured it out? Why? Yeah, why? Just curious. And it's not exact. I had to do some guessing. Tell me about it. I wanna hear. Me, too. All right. There are 6 cable cars and 19 ski lifts, the hotels, the restaurants, the bars, the ski instruction, even the sauna. 1/4 million. Christian, this is a funny question for someone who lives with you, but... Are you planning to Rob that place? Yeah. I don't even live with you, and I was thinking the same thing myself. Are you? No. But somebody will one of these days. The plan is perfect. You take the money, and instead of heading down toward Milan or turin, you get away into the snow, Bury the money into a remote place, and in the spring, you dig it up and walk away with it in your picnic basket. Where were you this morning, Christian? Up near the glacier. Doing what? Estimating how long it would take to get from the top to the bottom staying just north of the edge. And why would you want to know that? 'Cause that's the place he'd, uh... Bury the money. Huh? Maybe I'll write a book about how it can be done. How long did it take you? 4 minutes and 10 seconds. Where'd you wind up? There is a crevasse about a mile east of the tow bar at the top. Woman: Huh? That's where I'd put the money. But why don't you make some more coffee, and we talk about something else? How wide's the crevasse? 24 feet. And how do you get across? On a snowmobile. Woman: Ha ha ha! With $250,000 on your back? I don't really think it can be done. I was just making a theory. Let me worry about the snowmobile. You worry about the skiing. Hey! What about me? Isn't there something for me to do? Someone would have to get a look inside, where the vault is. That doesn't sound so hard. She would have to be very, very tricky. And it would help if she was beautiful, too. Hell! Let's do it. No, I'm serious! Who are you going to do it with? It was your idea. Ah, don't be crazy, Bob. It's a joke. A story you read in a magazine. We are not the type. Yeah? I'll do it myself. Where are you going? To prove we can do it. Christian: You can't get enough speed to jump this crevasse on skis, so nobody is going to come and look for the money here. Bob: You know what happens to a guy if he falls into one of these? He just lays there, as stiff as a board. Come back in 5,000 years, and he'd still be laying there. Ha ha! Just as fresh as ever. Just as broke, too. Christian, you really think we can do this? Can we just, uh... Absolutely. The one question is if you can jump the crevasse in a snowmobile. Ha ha! No sweat. 24 feet's a walk in the park. You are sure it's that easy, huh? Watch me. Ha ha! Ok, big boy. Yeaaah! Yee-hah! How's that for 24 feet, huh? Beautiful, Bob. What do you think? Ok. I'm willing to play. [Crowd noise on radio] [Turns volume up] Buon giorno, signorina. Buon giorno. Buon giorno. Buon giorno. Signor simonelli? Ce la signorina. Buon giorno. My name is simonelli. Hello. Ah, jewels. Yes. Uh, you wish a safe-deposit box? Yes. I should've come before, but you know... Uh-huh. Can be dangerous leaving them at home or in the hotel, eh? Oh, no. I'm living down there. I have an apartment. My apartment. Oh, I see. You mind? A form? Oh, just for the record. Everyone must, uh...You know. Um, maybe you'd rather sit down to write, eh? Yes. Please. [Starts camera] It's against the rules, you know, for guests to be in this office. Oh, yes? Those buttons-- is that how you get in? They have to be pressed in a certain order. If they're not, the alarm system goes off. There's simonelli. Not bad looking, huh? I know what he looks like. Didn't he hear the noise of your camera? No. I had my radio in my purse. I was listening to the football game. Fantastic, lady. Ha ha! Would you look at him? He doesn't even have a clue he's being photographed. What charm. Ha ha! There's the vault. And the money is right there on the shelf. [Turns projector off] Nice work. How're we gonna get the combination to the buttons? I'll have to get it. I think I'm making progress with simonelli. Ha ha ha. Let me tell you something funny. Please. I have been in cervinia for 7 weeks. And I missed knowing you all that time? I waited to meet someone I'd want to dress up for. To have the occasion to wear the jewelry. And you didn't find him? I did. Oh. But only after I came here... Met you, and put them away. Funny how things happen. Are my jewels really safe? Why? With the door to the vault open like that? Oh. The real security is outside. The panel with the 3 buttons? Yes. That, and 3 other alarm systems. May I see you to the door? No, no, thank you. It's been lovely. Good night. Hey. I thought you'd be asleep. It's nearly 4:00. No. Bob just left. We have been cutting newspapers all night. $250,000 worth. Ha ha! They fit into the rucksacks perfectly. Oh, good. Did you have a good time? Yes. We drove to Milan. Milano? You must have been driving all night long. What did you do there? Had dinner. That's all? That's all we had time for. It's cold. I did not get it, Christian. I didn't get the combination to the buttons. We knew this might happen. And there was nothing? Nothing at all? I'm sorry, Christian. Then it's all over? Yeah. It's all over. Until this minute, I didn't know it was so important to you. Not like this. Are you so empty inside, so thirsty for money? Empty. That's the word. What a fantastic thing it could've been. Something to remember all your life. I wonder if just doing it wasn't more important than the money. Maybe there's a simple lesson. What? Crime doesn't pay? That the office is not the place to take the money. It has buttons, alarm systems... It has a complete security. But simonelli and I left tonight through the garage, and he complained about it because the garage is underground, because the radio doesn't work. The money truck radio... They can't use it in there. Exactly! That's the place. The garage. [Horn honks] Hey! Hey! Nice of Monica to let US use her car. Yeah. She should only know. During the war, my father was in the French underground. But when the war ended, many people stayed underground. You understand? Just like the mafia. Yes, but not the mafia. I was very young, and I only saw them a few times. The last time was at my father's funeral. That was when they told my mother and me that they liked him very much and they were loyal to him... And if we ever needed anything, we should call. Did you? Only once... For the guns. Yeah, that's great. You call them up, they send you their guns, and a week later, the trevino lodge gets knocked over. No. Even if they made the connection, what I do is my own business. That's the way it is with those people. You know what they'll say? "Look at that Christian, that good for nothing boy. Finally got out of his skis and did something worthwhile." I'll bet they'll even have a party. Yeah. They'll be able to afford it after grabbing half the loot. No. They wouldn't do that. If my father trust them, they have to be trusted. I'll put my life on it. I hope you're right, Christian. I hope you're right. Christian: The money truck stops just where vito's snow cat is. You jump the ignition. Tie the accelerator down, and 20 minutes later, I'll come to the garage. That's 7:45, huh? Just about. Then the snow cat crashes into the money truck, we take the money and head for the mountains. Hey, if he doesn't park in the same place, we're screwed. He will. That's his place. Always? Every day since 4 months. [Thumping] Maybe it's too soon. Maybe we should plan it better. Hey, Christian, we can't wait. I mean, what if the snow melts? What are you gonna do then, ski on the grass? Ok. Bob: You know, I better have a practice shot. I haven't hot-wired anything since-- since high school. Here. Some light. Bob: You take a cable car to the top. After I get off the tow bar, I'll ski across to the snowmobile and drive it to the crevasse. I'll wait for you or all the cops in the world. Hopefully me. Chris, you know there's only 2 ways down that mountain: The front side or the back side. What are you gonna do if there's a problem? By the time the police block off the mountains, we should be back at the lodge. Go on. If they do block off those slopes, the only other way down is the glacier. Even if it was possible to ski it, you could never do it in time, Christian. If I am off the cable car before the police helicopter gets into the air, we have no problem. No problem? Well, I'm just a little bit worried about standing around in the middle of 10,000 acres of snow wearing a red jacket and $125,000. Huh? You can take the jacket off. Come on, Christian, what about the helicopter? I'll be there before the helicopter. Don't worry. When I was skiing in France, a man named noyes was minister of sport. A god to US because he had climbed annapurna, a mountain of 26,000 feet. No one had ever done it before. When he got down, they had to cut off all his fingers and toes. They were frozen so badly. But back to France he said he was glad he had done it. Because every man has at least one annapurna in his life. I think about that these days. Maybe this is our annapurna. Ok. Go hide the snowmobile. I'll see you tomorrow. [Dog barks] Christian? Yes. It's not the 3 of US anymore, is it? Of course it is. You figured out the new plan. Buon giorno, signor simonelli? Eunice? Yes, sir. We'll be back in a moment. This way. Bene, bene, bene. [Speaking Italian] Guard: Good morning. Second guard: Good morning, signor simonelli. Ciao. [Inaudible conversation] 2 bags. 4 altogether. 2 more. [Speaking Italian] Simonelli: Who's there? What's happening? Now, what's that? [Excited shouts] Bob: Get away! Guard: He has a gun! [Inaudible speech] Bob: Quiet! [Speaking Italian] Let them have the money. Let them take the money. No. No. Let them go. Let them go. Christian: Break that key off. Man: Who are they? See ya. Come on, Lorraine. Ciao, donato. Ah, donato, you are no fun at all. Wait. Wait, please. Have some of this. Ciao. Let's go. Driver: Come on. It's late. Man: Hey, Chris! Hey. Buon giorno. Ciao. The snow report for the top is good this morning, eh? Yeah, beautiful. Can't wait to get up there. Guard: They should be getting here. [P.A. in Italian] P.A.: The next cable car leaves in 3 minutes. [Singing opera] Ooh! Jesus! [Banging] Eh? [Banging continues] Man: Get this door open. Are you sure nobody's hurt? Yeah. Yeah. Hurry up. [Everyone talking] [Speaking Italian] [Speaking Italian] [Telephone buzzes] Pronto. Man: We've got an emergency. Stop the cable cars for 3 minutes. Ok. Start it when I call you. [Speaking Italian] Hello, control. The people are all upset about stopping. Ah, that's the problem. Policeman: Hurry up down there. Move them down. Hurry up. You men go down to the snow cat. [Motor starts] [Everyone speaking Italian] [Speaking Italian] P.A.: Attention. These slopes are closed. Attention. These slopes are closed until further notice. [P.A. announcement in Italian] Police radio: Proceed to main ski slopes and observe mountain area for individuals carrying rucksacks or other means of conveying large sums of money. [P.A. announcement in Italian] Officer in charge: All right, men. Spread out. Pilot: Helicopter to ground control. Now hovering the cable terminal. No signs of anything unusual. Proceeding west. Unh! Lord. Pilot: Now we're coming up on plateau Rosa. Looks like both ski slopes are closed. We're going to check the adjacent areas. Man: Ok. Uh, we're into the glacier now and haven't seen anything. Guess we ought to head back. Ground control: No. Proceed on in to the glacier to make sure. Pilot: Make sure of what? Who the hell would be down there? Pilot: Uh, control, we're halfway through the glacier now and coming up on an ice wall. There's something on the top that could be ski tracks, probably a small crevasse. But I'll give it another look. I knew I'd have to wait. Come on! Patrol, we're still trying to figure out if those are ski tracks down there. I don't see how they could be, but we'll keep checking the area. We're moving on. There's not much of the glacier left. If these are ski tracks, we'll be catching up to that guy any second now. Man on radio: You still don't know for sure? Still don't see how they could be. Damn! [Helicopter approaching] Jesus. [Whistles] Whoo! Here you go, Bob! Take these to mother. Get going. Keep moving. I'll see you back at the lodge. Yes! Yes! Yeah! Helicopter, give me your position now. Didn't see anything on the glacier. We're just about back to the main slope. [Cheering] Look at him. Idiot. Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Better go to work, huh? [Siren] Hey! Hey! Hey, did you hear? Somebody robbed the lodge. They robbed the lodge. Come on. Move out of here. Come on. Come on. Take it easy. No pushing. What's going on? Did you hear what happened here this morning? They robbed the lodge. They see it? There were 2 of them. They got away. No shit. How about that? Hey, did you hear? A quarter of a million dollars, and they got away. They got away? It's all in cash, too. Police have no idea even where... Police officer: Go on. Go on. Go on. Everybody home. Halt. [Speaking Italian] Quite a little excitement this evening, huh? Signor dolphi, please excuse. Funny business you're getting into. And with these incredible temperatures. You need the brains of a yak to go hunting for robbers in this snow. Nothing yet? They won't get away. Unless they give half to you. Ha ha ha ha! Buona fortuna, signor dolphi. Let him go. No, no, no. Scusa, signorina. Good evening, sir. Good evening. Welcome to cervinia. I hope your journey was a pleasant one. Thank you. As good as can be expected when the road twists like a nervous eel. Anyway, a good night's sleep in the mountain air. Yes, I'm sure. I'd like you to arrange to have, uh... One of the ski instructors meet me in the morning. Of course, sir. What time? Uh, 9:00. I don't want just any man. Give me someone who knows the area well. A guide as well as an instructor. I will attend to it personally. Do you want wine this afternoon, Christian? Polenta. What do you think? Do we have any occasion to celebrate? Well, I don't think it's difficult to find the occasion. I think it's difficult to find the money. Yes. You are right. Bitter, Gina. Ok. You must have been saving up. Ah, always for wine. Buono giorno, Christian. Donato, buono giorno. Gerico dolphi. I'm sorry. Signor dolphi, Monica scotti, Christian biton. Buono giorno. How are you? Signor dolphi just arrived. He's come here to investigate the robbery. You don't mind me mentioning that, do you? No, no. It's nothing that... Why don't you sit down with US? Yes, please. You are very kind, but maybe you prefer to be alone. No. Please sit. Please join US. Grazie, Christian. Are you with the carabinieri? No, no. I'm privately employed. On special assignment for the insurance company. They find themselves up against a rather formidable cliff. I see. Any clues? Thank you. A shred here, a shred there. Of course, we've just begun. Well, we wish you luck. Yes, sure. Good luck. [Speaking Italian] Just among the 4 of US, I think we're going to lose this one. So soon? It's just too much. Mountain upon mountain of snow, and a place to put the money under every square foot. Well, you can always wait for summer when the snow melts. I'm afraid not. The carabinieri will keep an eye out for 2 weeks, possibly 3. After that, they shrug and go home, and once they're gone... The money can be safely removed from the area. So what will you do? Uh, fortunately, I'm a salaried employee. Recovery or not, I still get paid. Then at least you should enjoy yourself while you're here. That is exactly my intention, believe me. In fact, it's already begun. Auguri. Yeah, good health. Salute. Ah, wonderful, marvelous mountains. Marvelous! Feel it, donato. The basis of your suspicion, donato, is that you saw this fellow-- what's his name? Bob, uh... Bob Skinner. Bob Skinner. You saw him near the lodge at approximately 7:30. Did you see anyone else? No. No. Well, my first order of business when one person accuses another is to find out what reason the accuser might have for making the accusation. Do you--do you follow this train of thought? Yes... I follow. The second point I might mention is that making a strong accusation tends to bring a full inspection of the accuser's possible involvement. Both points argue for restraint and caution. Wouldn't you agree, donato? The third and final point is that... If you try to remember what I told you, I'll try to remember what you told me. Weight on the downhill ski, wasn't it? Just let me ask one more question. Yes. Go ahead. The taledon glacier, are you familiar with it? Yes. Of course I am. The police helicopter thought they spotted some ski tracks on it. Is it possible? Huh? Pos-sible. Is it possible that someone from here could have skied it? Nah. No one? Well, maybe a tiny handful. No, really only one. Who? Who would you say that one is? [Doorbell rings] Buono sera. Buono sera. Signor simonelli. I think I have the wrong apartment. I was looking for Monica. Christian, look at this band. Miss scotti. Well, no need to stay outside in the cold. Why don't you come in? No, thank you. Uh... I only dropped...By to assure miss scotti that... Her jewels are safe. I'm really very relieved. I was concerned, but didn't want to bother you. Well, I'd better go. Thank you for coming by. Yes, of course. Good night. Good night. Buono sera. He won't say anything. What? He won't say anything. Say anything about what? About your going there with the jewels and showing you the safe. He'd lose his job. I wasn't even thinking about that. What were you thinking about? Him. You saw him, the way he looked. Yes. His pride was hurt. Do you think it's the first time? No, but I'm sorry about the way we used him. Used how? He saw you, he liked you, he took you out. It wasn't exactly the love affair of the century. And ours is? Yes, it could be, but only if we stop playing games with each other. No. Could never be. Too many lies, Christian. They spoil the brew. Then why don't you run after simonelli? He's just the kind who'd take you back, no questions, and the two of you can go live in his vault. You know what? I might be bad, but you're worse than I am. Aha! It's really a wonderful sport. Some of you fellas are quite superb, yourself included, huh? Thank you, sir. Who would you say is the best skier up here? The best? That's a hard question. Ha ha ha! Are you just being humble? Hell, no. There's lots of guys up here who are better than me. Half a dozen, at least. But which one is the very best? Who, for instance, would be good enough to ski... Taledon, the glacier? Taledon? I don't know anybody dumb enough or crazy enough to ski there. I sure as hell wouldn't. Let's say it was a matter of life or death, or better still... A quarter of a million dollars. I wouldn't even do it for a whole million. There seems to be some difference of opinion. Oh, yeah? How so? Christian biton is a friend of yours. I know him. Know him? Yeah. He's a friend of mine. Was he anywhere near the lodge Monday morning, say around 7:30, 8:00? How the hell should I know? Oh, I'm sorry. Someone told me you were there. I thought you might have seen your friend. Nope. I didn't see anybody. But you were there. What if I was? Nothing. Were you? Late date, huh? Or an early one. About the glacier... That difference of opinion... Several people here are convinced that one man is capable of skiing it. Ha ha ha ha. Curiously, they think your friend could, Christian biton. Isn't this something? Huh? In all this confusion, it seems that I could even build a case against you or against you and Christian. [Whispering] Jesus. Ha ha ha ha ha! [Footsteps] Oh. Good evening. I didn't know you were expecting company. Perhaps I should come back another time. No, it's ok, really. I, uh... I just came by to borrow that motorcycle magazine. No, please. Continue. Come on, Bob. Sit down. Well... It's late. This mountain air brings on an early fatigue, so let me get through it all quickly. A gentleman of considerable influence in this area believes there were 3 people involved in this robbery, and he believes he knows who they are. My problem is finding a way to tell the guilty party that my company is not out for revenge. The police want to see people behind bars. My company is only concerned with the quick return of the money. I'm sure that's very generous of them, but how exactly does this apply to US? Well, I thought that perhaps you could help in some way. Yeah? How? What I need is a note telling me exactly where the money is. The note can be unsigned. I don't suppose anyone would want to sign such a note. No, I don't suppose anyone would. I will then be able to retrieve the money and return it to the owners, and the whole idea of the cervinia ski theft will become another chapter in the glorious lure of the alps. Sounds very simple. Very. But useless unless acted upon immediately. The carabinieri know almost everything I know, and I expect within a matter of hours, they will reach the same conclusions I have. I'm still not sure I completely understand what your conclusions are. Well...3 people... 3 very plucky people, in my opinion, stole the money. Employees of the corporation is usually the case. Why 3? I thought you said it was 2. The gentleman I mentioned said something about a young lady's visit to the vault, a bag of jewels, a more than curious interest. This and the excellence of the skiing limit the candidates to a small group. Perhaps you pass the word along. These 3 cannot keep the money. But my way, they can at least keep their freedom. I made it sound a bit too simple, but if none of it makes sense to you, just ignore it, and we'll see what tomorrow brings. Good night,e it a point all 3 of you. Sleep well. Let's give it back. Give it back? It's all over, Christian. And he's giving US a break that none of US counted on if it turned out like this. He doesn't even know we did it. He seems to know everything. Carabinieri are gonna know, too. There's no doubt about that. Ohh. We really blew it. We might as well have left them a map. We still have the money, and he still doesn't know where it is. Doesn't even matter if we go to jail. Once we get out, they're gonna be waiting for US. We won't even be able to touch that money. What if he's lying? About what? What if we give him the money, and he goes to the carabinieri anyway. Not the point. Right now, we got a chance. He's giving US a chance. We can still keep our freedom. I want to give it back. It's no good anymore. We can kill him. We can, you know? It will be easy. I mean, finding a way to do it without risk. We're giving that money back. First thing tomorrow morning, we're giving it back. Is that why we did it? Is that why I almost killed myself in the glacier? And you. You made that jump for nothing? It's ours. No, it's not ours. We fought to get it. Now we have to fight to keep it. Jesus, are you blind? He's got US. He doesn't have US. He has nothing. And if you don't want to get your hands dirty, I'll do it myself. We ain't killing him! No, we won't kill him, Christian! And you won't! Then it's over. And for nothing. Bob: Yeah. We'll give him a note telling him where the money is tonight. [Dance music plays] [Loud chatter and laughter] I'm trying to figure out how things change like this. 10 days ago, we were happy. Why'd you do it? I loved him. I really loved him. You understand? Yeah. Yeah. I don't think he really meant what he said about killing dolphi. No. You know, I really feel better now than I have for 2 weeks. Me, too. One thing's for sure: After tomorrow, we'd better pack it up and get out of here. Yeah, ok. That creep might still try to grab US. I'll pack in the morning. Good. What about tonight? You go back to him? He won't be there. I know him. Let's get out of here. He's got it. He's on his way now. Well, let's get out of here then. Now, who the hell is that? Is it coming for him? Christian: That's not a police helicopter, is it? That's all we need. No, it's private. Bob: Hey, what if he's not really an insurance agent? Christian: He doesn't need a helicopter to get back down the mountain. He's stealing it! Son of a bitch. Hurry, Christian! Bastard stole the money! [Muttering in French] I just wanted to say something before we all left. Seems like a dream, Christian. Sometimes I wonder if it ever really happened. It did happen, and we did it. Anyway, I didn't come by to say all that. I just came by to say good-bye. Christian... These were the good ol' days. Ciao. Ciao, Bob. Where will you go? Home. It's time to live quietly for a little while. I really have loved you. I know. Will that be forgotten? Not that. Not you. What about dolphi, what I said about killing him? You don't have to say anything about that. Remember me, Monica, and remember that every day we woke up together, I loved you. It's so sad, Christian. [Train whistle blows] Well, well, monsieur biton... Monsieur le grand skier. Ha ha ha ha ha. Monsieur the best partner in all the world. Yes, monsieur le insurance investigator. Christian, you seem sad. About the lady? Yes. A little sad about the lady.
