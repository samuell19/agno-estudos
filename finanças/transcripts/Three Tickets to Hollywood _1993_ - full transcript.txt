Then I'll fuck you all by the list, ?ikica. Be patient, Mrgud. Have rest. Here is papers. You want to piss? -It's late now. ''Soviet crafts flows towards Cuba.'' Read! ''At this moment 30 soviet ships floating towards Caribbean sea. At the same time an American war fleet, which counts 40 ships, patrols near the Cuban shores to preclude the transfer Soviet military equipment to Cuba. If one party doesn't persist, If Soviet ships won't go out of route...'' -You know when Soviets will go out of route? Never. - ''...or American fleet persists, the 3rd World War is inevitable. The World is on the edge of nuclear catastrophe.'' Only war can save us. -America never lost the war. They will this one. I guarantee you. -Napoleon and Hitler were kissed Russian's ass. Thanks to the Russian winter. Kennedy will attack from Washington. Stop it! You are not at the wedding! Kosta! Kostica! Listen to me. If ''Greifer'' get jammed, turn off the light, that tape doesn't burn out. Is it clear? -It is. -Good. -I must go. -Me too. Go to bed. Good night. -Good night, Lumi?re. See you tomorrow. -See you. Quicker! What is cow doing in the house, Dad? -It's war. I got two wars behind me. She's only who could save us. Ru?a! What is it? -Are you heard? Train. Which train in this time? What is it with you? You've been turning whole night. And grit with teeth. What's wrong? Why you don't sleep? How I'm gonna sleep, Ru?a, when I close my eyes, train is coming. He goes straight to me, wants to override me. It's madness! Come to bed. We're hadn't for a long time! I can't. Until President don't come, I can't. I'm thinking only about him. Only he is in my thoughts. I dream of him, standing in the window of train, and next to him are generals, and comradess. Sometime he's smiling, sometimes he threats me with finger. Like this. Relax. Come. Come, like in good old days. It'll be easier for both of us. Come. -I can't, Ru?a. Sorry, but I can't. I can't get stiffy. Are you heard? -What? Train. -Train? -In yard. Open! Who's it? -?ika! Open! He's coming! -Who? -He! Who 'He'? -President. They reported just a minute ago. President is coming! -Tomorrow at 12:00 AM. Tomorrow, ?ivadin Grujic, tomorrow! ?ika, ?ikica, my brother, tomorrow! If I hadn't compel you to enroll in course or in party, now you would be slave at caf? of your mad father. Or would be hanging around the world as your corrupt brother. And whore around, like your sister. I'm through with class enemy, with religion, with family. I'm through with all. It's a meadow in front of me. A meadow. Ru?a, should I take my gloves off when shaking with President? Do it like he does. Clever. Good morning. -Son, today it's holiday. -I know, it's my birthday! Dad's got a lot of work today. President is coming once in a lifetime, and your birthday is every year. Grow high! Now breakfast, then quickly among other pioneers. Ru?a, bind him scarf! Dear listeners! We interrupt the regular program, to bring you the latest message suggestion of our specific reporter from Havana. Situation in Cuba is becoming more serious with every hour. In a last night's speech president Fidel Castro is clearly said, that Cuba won't delay a military option, if president Khrushchev and Kennedy don't find compromise. Cuba is now potentially focus of 3rd world war... Where is that Cuba? ...becoming a threat to the world if it turns to 3rd world war... Cuba? In a three mother's pussies! I learned it at courses, then forgot. Who will remember all those countries. Cuba is an island country in Caribbean sea, the capital is Havana, 8 million citizens... -Enough! Don't confuse me! I don't wanna know anything that I don't need to! Bye. -Bye, son. -Bye, son. Everything but the war. -There, maybe. Here won't. Never! But, if it happens, we'll win. Like we're winning to this day. The greatest general leads us, and I'm his soldier. What you doing, man? Oh, it's only 6 hours to go, I will late! Is it everything OK, Ru?a? Stop it, I'll sneeze. Kosta, son, come! Hurry, come! Happy birthday! How do you know? -I know. It's for you: ''History of Cinema.'' -Thanks. Where's Charlie? -I don't know. Look for him. One-two, one-two, we're happy children, to harvest we go and we'll renew town also. We're pioneers of our region, there's half of battalion of us. Charlie! I won't. What's the matter? -I won't go. How, Lumi?re is waiting for us. -I got nothing to wear. What about you? - I'll manage something. Happy birthday! -Thanks. Look, what I got. ''History of Cinema.'' Where you've been, Charlie? Hurry.

What a welcome! Thank you, people! Nikola! -Lumi?re! -Welcome. -You too. Spasoje... Nikola! -Sister! It's my Lucija. Good, Charlie. Picture. -This is my wife Mary. Hi, Nikola. Do you remember me? -Of course I do. Who are these? -It's Nikola, Gavrilo's brother. Now he's creek! Understood. Clear. Nice reception you have made for brother. Your doomsday has come, Gavrilo! -What brother? What you mumbling? Go out and look. Enough of singing! Stop the music! Long live President! -Shut up, moron! What you doing, livestock?! Are you blind?! Stop that fool! Enough, I said! Gavrilo! My brother! -I'm not your brother, you scoundrel! Right now you have to show up! To spoil me everything! Gavrilo, on the mother's grave... -Back off! -Gavrilo... I got nothing with you. No mother or father. I'm through with you. You're through with brain, Cain! People, thank you for this lovely reception, which you have prepared to my son. -Because of tense foreign affair situation, President wouldn't come today. General test was successful. They were small skips, but we'll make better. Food and drink at my home free! -Now you can go easily. He shite the pole. What I'm gonna do, Ru?a? -Arrest him. You think? -He would arrest you too, if he'd be on your place. Possibly they done it intentionally, to check me. It's even worse! It may turned, that I recepted him like a President. With white gloves, red carpet and pioneers. ?ivadin will betray me first. He hardly waits to put ass in my armchair. You must prove to comrades, that you're through with family. Report him. -And I will. Give me committee. Urgently. Gavrilo Milentijevic, from police station Gornje Polje. Condition normal. Reception probe performed, notified irregularities moved instantly. With special train in village arrived man from USA. -Nikola Milentijevic! Nikola Milentijevic. -With foreign wife. With foreign wife, American, and foreign son, American. Nothing needs to be checked. I know by heart. He was my brother. After the war, he emigrated to USA, now he's back after 13 years. Ask what to do. Understood! It'll be easy with Russians, I control situation. You can have total confidence in me. What they said? They gave me untied hands. -Better they gave you backup. Ru?a, why do I need backup? I've dreamed of this 13 years. I brought you to taste what America drink and eat. Now Mary will show you how to chew. I never put sweeter thing in my mouth. Shit as shit. Just sweet. Made in USA. World's strongest force. Where's yours? I ate mine long ago. Oooh, it impacts inside nose! -In ears too. Sweeter than Epiphany water. If they eat and drink this, it must be a war. They will be war surely. When we finish with Russians, whole world will eat and drink this. -So, Kennedy is already laid out army? -Whole America is in military standby. We'll surely win. -America always win. Guys, I think it's the best that we write backup letter to Kennedy. We'll send it to Washington. You, Nid?a, will translate it. That way will American troops, when they march in Gornje Polje, know on which side we fight. Is it OK? -Yeah!! Check in, what's happening there. -I will. What they do, I wonder? -I got insider there, who'll tell me everything. Good. -Is that circus over? -Circus, you say? Now I'll gonna show you, how bear dance at circus. I was joking. -Open! -You are free, but temporarily. As soon as I announce that President is coming, you'll be here in 3 minutes, clear?! Quick! -I don't want to seek you all over! Quicker! Well, Mrgud, where is nice behaviour? -Will you release livestock too? They will die. -It's not your business. -Out! Quicker! Give me my knives back! -Out! ''Let go bitches' nose'': Say it. -Let go bitches' nose. Good, good, Mrgud. Key. You're stayin'. ''In film apparatus, pictures...'' -Can we go in? -Of course, uncle Spasoje. Forward, grandpa. It's for you, Charlie. -Thanks, uncle Spasoje. I brought you new member of the cinema. You are brothers. Hug each other. You to come, Charlie. Oh, my grandsons! Look, is it good? -Left. -Turn a bit left. Good. Now? Why they gathered like flies on a crap? What is this? -Antenna for TV set. Nikola brought it from America. -That bastard have already back? He came for business. -What's with ours? I listened on radio, that general Malinovsky spoke on closed meeting of communist party. There won't be loosening, and weapon for Castro will be delivered. Tonight we have to organize meeting, we must form crisis unit. Get lost! -Bring us drink. -Vodka? -Vodka. Hey, I must go... Wait, people. What you have scared of? What? What you have scared of? This is television. American doesn't need cinema nor papers. He got window to the World in his own house. I got window in my tavern, and it's too much for me. American technique is unrivaled. Russians were maybe first soared to Space, but American will first step on Moon. -Then we'll have window to Moon, to see what's happening there. Can't believe with own eyes! Alive chicken! Chicken! Only American brain could invent this. I am John Wayne. Good, one more time. Kosta, be more funny. Go! -I am John Wayne. Is it good, Charlie? -Great! When we grow up, me and Charlie go to Hollywood to shoot a movie. Great idea. Good. -Have you been there? -No, but I would love to go. Lumi?re gave us projector, camera, tracks, films. We collect money for trip. Look how much we got. Would you join us? -You accept me? -We accept you. Charlie! In this booklet writes everything about movie. We learn from it. Read, Kosta. -''In all states, before premiere, movie must be reviewed by board for censorship. In our country board is in Zagreb. Ministry of Internal Affairs appoints members of the board.'' Who would give approval to us? Your father? -That won't be good. ''American auditory, exhausted from daily work, don't like complicated plot but understandable, without lyric elements, and without artistic ambitions. American actors were drafted among stunts, that's why they're bad in artistic sense. Russian movie is made by confirmed artists who doesn't work for big bucks, but because of pure love for art.'' I just fixed him. I must washed him too. We will wash him. If you even shrill of this, we'll burn your store. Clear? Open, it's me. Right away! ?ivadin! -You were not still for long, eh? Leave it, don't make a fool out of yourself -You are arrested all! Let's reconcile and talk. We are humans. -We ain't got talk about anything. Hands up and out! One by one. Gavrilo would destroy you totally. -I know why you gathered. What kind of map is this? We fight for communism. -In this country communism already rule. What kind of communism is this, when your boss draggin' foreign agents here. And you do nothing. Americans are under surveillance. -Why you haven't arrested him? They are brothers, Milentijevic's. Same scum. And what reception he arranged for him! -6 months he makes fool out of us. He made up arrival of the President, in order to make reception for brother. Summon the wisdom, fool! Or you want to hang on same rope with him? Don't you see, that Soviet ships penetrate to Cuba? In 24 hours 3rd world war will begin. Communism will conquer whole planet. You are talking with the fresh-formed Committee of the Soviet government. Tonight in the shadow, in the morning we'll walked out. We offer you Gavrilo's place. You'll judge him personally for high treason. You think that I have to meet President? -We will all meet him together. Our President, Nikita Khrushchev. -With this pictures. What they are saying? -I don't understand nothing. -How? Why I sending you to school? -We learn russian there. -Russian? From tomorrow you will start to learn american. Clear? -OK. If I would know which way is Cuba, I'll start off right now to help our brothers Americans. We're all here gathered, thanks to God, like you always wanted. Only that degenerate pulling to his own side. Bitter bread he choose. He prefer nightstick rather than family. Arrest and beat this poor people. He doesn't scared of God. Only listens that red gang up there. Why you pick him for sheriff, if he's not OK? -Have you go berserk? Mum, I will do everything that we reconcile. I will go to him, and give him my hand. He will take it, if he's my brother. We're going. Mum, they lie everything! Everyone says, that I'm first man in Gornje Polje. Some for love, some for fear. But it's true. I don't allow them to sprout my reputation, even if they're family 100 times. It's my brother, but I must arrest him. For his own good. And when I meet and send off President, they will give me such position, that you will be proud of me for the rest of your life. Bye, Mum. From me you wanted to hide, eh? From Gavrilo? You fucking traitors! Gavrilo knows everything. There's no pit, where you could hide! You reactionist gang! We abrade knives! Come, people! What happened? Talk! We ate, drink... We got tip too. We saw television. Miracle of miracles. And about what was spoken? -Mostly about good old times. Do Globe knows, that his wife coming at your place for shaving in the middle of the night? Nikola stated, that 3rd world war is inevitable. And that America will win. Later, he made a lecture about new world order. -Really? He said, that our country could stand on its own feet, just in case that capitalism returns. And others? -They confirm. They said, that nationalization is utopia, that they are robbed. That they don't have civil rights. About good old times, eh? -Globe said, that he'll personally establish contact with Kennedy. In what kind of sense? -In sense of support. Which way he thinks to manage it? -I don't know. Nikola brought various appliances. What appliances? -I didn't found out yet. He certainly got nuclear bomb. He work for CIA, fuckin' bastard! As soon as I saw him on the station, I knew that he's american spy! Milisav! Is Nikola mentioned Gavrilo? -He said that he'll go this afternoon to talk with him. To talk with him? What kind a fool I am! Globe said that too. -What? -That you're fool. -Globe, eh? We'll se, who is fool. You shave his wife, and I'm fool. Good afternoon. -Good afternoon, Mrs. Kova. What's up, girls? I said that we have no goods. Good afternoon, Mr. Nikola. Is it true, that american reserves amount 10 million tons of TNT per capita annualy to whole World? -Exactly. And Russians got 600,000 intercontinental rockets? -It's good. There's no goods. -Give us! -I don't have it! But there's for her, right? I'll call the police! Enter! Mrgud, wherefrom you here? -Fuck off, you traitor! Gavrilo, my brother! First name, last name, your father's name. Gavrilo! This is absurd. -First name, last name, your father's name. It's me, Gavrilo. You know father's name, we have same father. First name, last name, your father's name. Nikola Spasojev Milentijevic. Residence, address, citizenship. Shawnee, Oklahoma, USA. American citizenship. Shawnee? -Yes, Shawnee. Don't make a fools of ourselves. I came to speak like a brother. Why you came? Who send you? Who invited you? I was longing for my homeland. I came to visit my father, my sister, my brother.. I came to visit my mother's grave! -To visit?! You went there to idle me! Shame on you! -I never idle you. No one and never. Give me hand. Gavra... Gavra, my brother, what you doin'? Let me go. -Open! -I'm american citizen! Open! You will sorry. -Search everyone immediately, from house to house, scum is everywhere. I want lawyer! I demand phone contact with american embassy in Belgrade. ?ivadin! Have you forget, that they can announce President's arrival every minute?! Gentlemen, the war is knocking on the door. Barber, have you picked the side? Perhaps like in last war. -On both then, eh? I would rather go to sleep, and woke up when war's over. Folks, have you seen my Nikola? -He went to Gavrilo about 1,5 hour ago. They probably drink that american brandy now. Attention! Gavrilo Milentijevic speaks, police commander of Gornje Polje. It is noticed, that after delay of preparation for President's arrival and his absence, mood among the people isn't like it should be. I warn you that the President can arrive anytime. Today or tomorrow. Therefore, there's no time for relaxation. Caution 24 hours a day. We must think day and night of bright future of our town. Therefore, I remind you again. Be prepared! Strikingly! Absence of comrade President I've benefited for general exercise, which was very useful, but not for any other reasons. This I must stress, because there was lot of guessing among some individuals, which are highly detrimental to the safety-politic situation in our place. I note that the spread of lies and disturbance of people severely punishable. As for the loyalty of police commander to social order, you will easily convince yourselves. You arrested your own brother, misfortunate. -I am! And I would asrrest anyone suspicious! I'll arrest you, if need. Every person, who destroy in what honest people have invested their blood and sweat! I'll arrest you barber, and you Marko, you Globe and you postman. Whole town! I will meet President appropriate, or I won't be alive! Party gave me order and I will carry out! It isn't hard for me to sacrifice, but you will too! We'll sacrifice you too! I guarantee you! Boys, Gorne Pole! Gorne Pole! We're going with him! Hey, wait! Gorne Pole? -Yes. -Let's go. You know who is this, Charlie? -I have no clue. -Aldo. How you know my name? -Aldo, Natalija. Natalija, yes. -Lucija. -Yes. Thanks, fellows! All together! My Natalija! Aunt! Good afternoon, Mr. Policeman. -Good afternoon. Wow, he' handsome! I am Aldo. Quickly, Natalija! It's Aldo, Natalija! Quick, Natalija! Aldo! What is with me! Rejoice! My Aldo came! Father! -Lucija, my daughter! Natalija! Thank you, God! You returned my Aldo! Lucija, father came! What, what you looking at? What you staring at? Say something now! Say, that I'm Italian whore! My one and only husband came! What you staring at? Why you don't gossip now?! Say something now! Man of my life came. Of my life, are you heard?! My only man! Say, that I'm Italian whore! Say! Look him! -Natalija! -Aldo mine! Say something! What you looking? It's my man! Man of my life! Hello, committee?! I am, Gavrilo Milentijevic, Gornje Polje. Some Italian came. I know him. It's lover of Natalija Milentijevic, former occupying soldier. That's right. Clear. I compiled new isolation list, but I haven't enough jail capacities. Yes, it's clear. Understood. We're serving the people! 3, 4, 5... 1, 2... They made all those schools, cultural centers, hospitals... But prisons this small. Fuck the state without proper prison! Bravo! Bravo. Good night! -See you. Look, we earned 2,000. Don't cry. I have no parents, but I'm not crying. Look, I'm smiling. I will release uncle. -How? -Mom's got keys of prison too. It's me, barber. -Now we got all. Just to provide water for drinking. We could barely breathe here. Good evening. Why you crying, eh? Taste some head. Jail is for people too. Look, how pretty she is. C'mon, eat. Have some. -No, thanks. Russians are preparing total attack. -When they told you? I was with them shortly before. Mrgud is chosen for Chief of ORK, ZK and MK ''Politkom'' of the village. They prepare his release of prison. ?ivadin go over their side. -What I said to you? We must release Nikola urgently. Do they have weapon? -I heard personally when they established radio-contact with Moscow. They promised them 1,000 rifles and 2 Big Bertha's. Don't Big Bertha's are German cannons? German? Of course they are. Germans are with Russians. I mean, on Russian side. Everything's possible. However, Germans are always enemy. Russians! Who is it? Open! God help you, Spasoje. -God help you. I came to help. Two wars we win, two peaces lose. God will help us, that we release your son Nikola and destroy this red gang. With God's help! For Jesus's salvation! My beautiful dreams scattered, 'cause now your, wreath covers. Now the other man stands in altar with you... Quiet, Lumi?re, you'll woke up everyone! Natalija, my happiness and sadness! -Go to shop, I'm coming right away. I'm going. And my beautiful dreams scattered, 'cause now your, wreath covers.
