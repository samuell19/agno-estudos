(people chattering and laughing) Where is she? Damn, I'm good! O-M to the G. Tahlia, you are incredible. Wow, cool hair! Oh, Butler, snap a few pics, will ya? Oh why, oh why, couldn't my last name be Senator instead of Butler? - Ah, - Yeah, give me that. Grace: Come here! Let me see. This one. Yes. Perfect! Hashtag "naughty list." I got to fix it. Oh, yeah. You should throw a filt-- - What do you think? - (gasps) Hot. - Butler: That is hot AF. - Tahlia: Mm-hmm. Look at your mom. Girl! she had some swagger. You both look really happy. Tahlia: Yeah. It was all for show. Obligatory Christmas card photo. It's okay to, you know, miss her. Well, I don't. It's kinda hard to miss someone that was never really around in the first place. Mm. Anyway, I am gonna finish getting ready. Okay. Go! Butler: I am so... ♪ ♪ (Christmas hip-hop music playing) Thank you. All right! All: Yeah! Let me see that. Perfect! Thanks, G. Great party. Thanks, Perez. Shots later. Hoo! - I mean, it's hard, but-- - Why is Jen Chen here? She's such a vibe killer. Did I invite her? I-I don't know. Oh God, she doesn't remember inviting me. I knew it. Just smile and wave. Smiling and... waving. Do we know who he is? I don't know, but he's hot. Super-hot! I mean, he's okay. Tahlia: Nah! He's too pretty. Butler: Grace is into bad boys. - Remember that football player? - Right. - That summer was so much fun! - Okay, okay. You guys, I'm hosting a party. Come on, let's go. (dance music playing) Ah! Get down. Get down. (yelling) (clapping) Pancake time! (Butler claps) Mmm, Butler. You are literally killing me. What are you doing here? You were in no position to be left alone last night. Oh God. (sighs) How much do you remember? Grace: Did I make out with someone random? Mmm. Did I dance on the table? (hip-hop music playing) (people cheering) When your mom's a criminal! Grace: Did I make an inappropriate toast that included a dig at my mom? Grace: All the respon-- Sure did. (groans) Look, honey, I know you've had a rough year since she's been gone and I will always be by your side, but it's time to take it down a notch. Don't you think? How proud are you that I didn't just break out into song when I said "since she's been gone"? Honestly, I am so proud of you. Thank you. (cell phone ringing and buzzing) (gasps) (Grace groans) Great. I'm late. Okay. Up and at 'em. TMZ is reporting on a certain toy store heiress who got shmammered and made out with a roast pig at her holiday party. Well, that's just crappy journalism. 'Cause it wasn't a holiday party. All I am saying is it's not good for a company to have its CEO acting all cray. All eyes are on you. Whatevs. Marathon Toys is still struggling to keep up in the online market place. Eleanor Martin, the former CEO of Marathon Toys, created the Eve doll. The company took off, and she opened stores nationwide. That fairy tale came crashing down about two years ago. Right now, she is serving a five-year sentence in Decatur Women's Prison. Martin's daughter, Grace Martin, went overnight from being an Atlanta socialite to being the youngest CEO of a publicly traded company. That is so rude. Reporter: ...she has utterly failed-- Why do they always use that picture? I literally have so many better ones. Reporter: ...Atlanta, Georgia a bittersweet ending for the legacy of Eleanor Martin. Grace, how nice of you to join us. No prob. Hi, guys. You know, we set these meetings at noon per your request to give you ample time in the mornings. It'd be nice if you could be here on time. Oh wow. You know, I've never had a dad. I didn't know this is what it was like. A lecture in my board room in front of my board members. You're in my seat. We get absolutely crushed on Cyber Monday. So apparently closing down 250 stores isn't enough to boost online sales. There was an article in the Wall Street Journal last week, "How Toy Makers Lost Their Christmas Magic." Read it. Well, they're not exactly wrong. I mean, we've kind of lost it. It's almost like we just don't care anymore. That's definitely true for some people in this room. What is it we're having for lunch? Oh, my God. Grace: I'm starving. Kids love toys. And they always will. They're just not playing with the same old toys that their parents did. So sales are down because our products are uninspired. Where else can we possibly cut cost? I suggest we discontinue some of our old inventory to free up funds needed for the video game apps. I've complied a list of toys that are frankly bleeding this company dry. I say we put each to a vote. Think that all sounds a bit hasty. We are out of time, Carter. We are on the Titanic, and we need to get what's left of this company into lifeboats. You guys, I love that movie. He's so hot. The Marine Life Finger Puppets. All in favor to discontinue? Board members: Aye. Prickly Puddy. No one has bought that since 2007. All in favor to discontinue? Board members: Aye. The Eve Doll. The Eve doll is iconic. We lose that, we lose our identity. We'll have a new identity, Carter. Eve hasn't turned a profit in years. We can't do that. Eleanor founded this company with the Eve doll. Grace. Discontinue the doll. I doubt it's what my mom would want, but she's not here to make that call. So... all in favor to discontinue the Eve doll? board members: Aye. Great. We are just about done here, right? Can't believe you voted to discontinue Eve so quickly. How do you even know about that? That literally just happened in a private boardroom. I have spies. Spies everywhere. - Butler. - Carter, Carter actually. He-- Carter told me. That Carter Roth? That cutie from my boardroom. We text from time to time. At what time? Midnight till four a.m.? 'Cause that's called sexting, not texting. All I am saying is that your mom created the Eve doll. It should mean more to you than anyone else. And you just cut her head right off. - La-la-la-la-la. - Oh wow, very mature. Hey, we're about to go pick up Lex. You would fit right in. Girl: (laughing) I know, right? Oh, my god, look at that chick. (laughing) What the hell are they laughing at? I know. Right. Uh, uh, imagine those headlines. "CEO of Marathon Toys attacks a group of 12-year-old girls defending her young neighbor." - Don't do it. - (girls laughing) - Hi. - Lex: Hi. - Butler: Hi, honey. - Hi. - Thanks for the pickup. - No problem. None of my nannies could drive either. I was always catching rides home. Oh, no, Carmen can drive. It's just, she always wants to hear about my day or practice my vocab words or ask if I made any new friends. It's just like I just need a break sometimes. Uh, Lex, who were those Dweebettes. They are in the Christmas pageant with me. The one with the braid is Marley. She's playing the Virgin Mary. I'm cattle number seven. Moooo! (chuckles) Well, cattle are a very important part of the nativity, so that's pretty cool, Lex. I tried to interest them in my magic act, but that didn't go over too well. Lex, if these girls are being mean to you, you just say the word. I won't stop until every last one of them is shipped off to some miserable boarding school and you'll never have to see them again. Wow. (chuckles) That's kind of aggressive. Ignore her. Grace is having a rough day. Discontinued the Eve doll at her board meeting. What? No, you can't discontinue Eve. She's my favorite doll. Lex, the company is in trouble. It's, it's way more complicated than you can imagine. If the company is in trouble, you should just ask Eve for help. Your mom told me that whenever I felt lost or alone, I could ask Eve for help. I could make a wish and like magic, it would be all right. Yeah, no, I know. She told me the same thing. But, Lex, come on, we're both old enough now to know that magic isn't real. No one can fix our problems, especially not some doll. Magic is real. You just need to believe it. Okay, well, this super fun conversation reminds me. Um, Butler, I need to stop by the store to pick up a box of my mom's old things. Thank you. Let's go. ♪ ♪ Is that your old Eve doll? Geez, Lex, you scared the crap out of me. Yeah, this is my old Eve doll. A4114. It's the serial number on the bottom of her foot. I don't know why that number just always stuck with me. Maybe you are having a change of heart about discontinuing the Eve doll. Sorry, Lex, it's beyond my control. But it is not beyond Eve's. - What is this? - It's a book of spells. I found it in your mom's box of stuff. "To Eleanor, this book changed my life." "Maybe some other little girl can use it. Casey." We could use this to ask Eve for help, right? Oh, sweets. I wish it was that easy. Maybe it is that easy. - Magic is not-- - Don't say it. Magic is real. (sighs) Fine. You want to hold a séance... - we'll hold a séance. - Yay! - (exhales) - Okay. We have lit all the candles. What's next? Um, now we need some hair. Don't look at me. (chuckles) Not yours, the doll's. Oh, I'll do that. "You are now ready to commence with the incantation. "But do so wisely for it will only work once. "Repeat the spell until the transformation is complete. "Zamba, tarka, ishtu, nebarim. Zamba, tarka, ishtu, nebarim." Well, what do you know? Turns out magic doesn't work after all. You have to do it too. It's your doll. Come on, Grace. We're trying to save your company here. - Mm-hmm. - Close your eyes. Together: Zamba, tarka, ishtu, nebarim. Zamba, tarka, ishtu, nebarim. Zamba, tarka, ishtu, nebarim. Zamba, tarka, ishtu, nebarim. (inhales sharply) Okey-dokey. So, what do you say tomorrow we sacrifice a small animal? You are not very much fun. - Ouch! - I should get going anyway. Carmen's making her famous meatloaf. Meatloaf? I'm the un-fun one? Oh, it isn't as bad as it seems. Where's your mom anyway? I don't know. Um, Singapore, Tokyo... Paris. You can hang here. So, you're not going out? I mean, I did just try to cast a spell on a doll to save my company with a 12-year-old. So... I kinda deserve a night out. (chuckles) Whatever. I'll see you tomorrow. - Good night. - Lex: Good night. Enjoy your meatloaf. What's so special about you anyway? ♪ ♪ Grace. You're awake? Hi. - Hi. - Look at you. Uh, did we last night... Did we what? Sleep together? We sure did. And it was magical. I've waited a very long time for this moment. This moment? Am I your first girl? Yes. And it was everything I imagined it would be. (giggles) I'm sorry, I don't remember your name. It's me. Eve. Come on. You don't remember me? I hooked up with a girl named Eve. Wow, I really do have issues. Wow! Atlanta! Or Hotlanta, as they call it? Home of the Georgia Peach! World's largest producer of peanuts and pecans! And world's busiest airport. (mimicking aircraft) Let me guess. It's your first time here? Bingo! Can I call you a car? You can call me Eve! I'm so excited! Can we go outside? I mean, you can do whatever you want. I am not keeping you here. But I am gonna get coffee. 'Cause I need coffee first. This place is fancy. Almost as fancy as Eve's modern mansion. Almost. Wow! Dude! What are you doing? Dude. Jumping on this super-duper awesome bouncy couch. Listen, this was fun. Um, but, you know, I've got a big day. I've got meetings and all this other stuff I can't think of off the top of my head. So, you smell what I'm cooking? (sniffs) You're not cooking anything. Oh, is that coffee? Uh, yeah. Oh, my gosh, can I try it? You know what? Don't, don't, don't-- No, no, don't say anything. I'm just gonna try it, okay, because I like trying new things and being spontaneous. Uh-- (spits) - It's hot. - Yeah. You know, this is true all around the world. Coffee is hot. You know, I like it. Even though I have severe burns on my tongue, I enjoyed the experience overall. Yeah. You know, do you have butter? Really want some butter. Okay, Eve. Um, listen. I am sure you're a really nice girl and we had so much fun fooling around, but it's time for you to go because I'm pretty sure you're crazy. Crazy for you, Gracie Girl. What did you just call me? Only my mom calls-- Never mind. Yeah. Only your mom calls you Gracie Girl. Yeah. What do you know about my mom? Eleanor Martin? Founder of Marathon Toys. Divine creator of the Eve doll. Your mother is my hero. - (chuckles) - Whoo! Eleanor! I get it now. I get it. They hired you to change my mind. Okay, who was it? Lex? Butler? Hey, so, you're an actress or something? No, silly. It's me. Eve. Your doll. (giggles) And I'm your special friend. Oh, hell no. Eee! Do you want to know what makes the Eve doll so special? Nope. The Eve doll is your best friend, your secret confidant. That's great. Literally what it says on the box. Thank you. Bye. The Eve doll is someone you can turn to when no one else is listening. Okay, you know what? You've convinced me. You're awesome. Thank you so much for hanging out. Can you please just leave me alone now? I'm here to help you, Gracie Girl. Quit calling me that! Okay, okay. But I'm here to help you through the magical process of... magic. What? No. That's impossible. I mean, yeah, we did the spell but-- Yeah, the spell. This is insane. You are not my doll. Yes, I am. I was there for you when you were eight years old and you fell out of that tree house and you broke your collarbone. And I was there for you when they bullied you in school. And I was there for you when you became a woman on your 13th birthday. You had really bad cramps. - Okay. - Like, really bad. Ok-- Shh. Eve. (stomps foot) Okay. You know what? That's all public knowledge. It's probably on my Wikipedia page or something. I gotta go. Oh, where are we going? We are not going anywhere! I am going somewhere. The location to which I will not be disclosing. And you will be heading the opposite direction or I'll be forced to call the cops. The cops? I was a cop. Oh, I'm an expert in all police procedures and protocols. Man: Hey, get off my car! See. Man: Get on outta here. Whoo. Listen up, everybody, who is mimosa and where oh where, are your bottoms, young lady? Geez! It is a drink made with champagne and orange juice. Hmm.

Br-eakfast and lu-unch. Brunch. (chuckles) (chuckles) Uh, are you gonna introduce us to your lady friend? Um... yeah. Sure. This is my... - friend I guess. - Best friend. We met last night in a blackout. No, we didn't. The lights were totally on. Girl, you invited your hookup to brunch? Oh no. I did no such thing. Chick will not leave me alone. Hello. Hi, new friends. I'm Eve. I'm a doll. Wow. People don't usually introduce themselves like that but... okay. Uh, what's happening? What's going on here on your body? This is my evening wear look. Oh!

I'm afraid I can't bring you another one till you finish that one. - So... - Oh, yeah. Okay. (burps) Cool. Uh, can I get you anything? We already ordered. Are you hungry? Famished. Grace: Don't encourage her. Oh, my gosh. Look at all these amazing things to choose from. Okay, let's see. Um, okay. I'm gonna start with the French toast. - Okay. - And then the chicken and waffles. And after that, I'm gonna have the frittata. That's fun to say. Frittata. Frittata. Ta-ta-ta. (giggles) And then I'm gonna do the hoecakes and the hush puppies? - Hush puppies. - Puppies? Woof!

Yeah. We have butter. (squeals) Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm! Mm. Mmm. Mmm! Mmm! - Butler: Damn. - That's liquid butter. Do you care? Butler: Apparently, she doesn't. - Ah! - Hey. I'm Hyde Owens. Owner and head chef here. I had to come by and compliment you on your impressive order. Mmm. Mm. Everything is delicious. You know, you are a really good cook, - Chef Hyde. - Thank you. Your mommy and daddy must be so proud of you. She is so weird. I love her. Let me know if you need anything else, okay? Wanna make sure you're completely satisfied. Eve: I wanna make sure you're completely satisfied too, Chef Hyde. So let me know if there's anything I can do for you. Wow! Girl, he likes your peaches and wants to shake your tree. (giggles) What Tahlia is trying to say is that he was totally flirting with you. - Flirting with me? - Tahlia: Oh yeah. As in verbally communicating the desire to have romantic relations? - Mm-hmm. - We-- Yeah. Butter your biscuit. That's exactly what I said. - Are you gonna eat that? - Girl! You got a hollow leg or something? - I do! - Definitely a hollow head. Oh, that too. Grace, Butler told me about the vote to discontinue the Eve doll. - What's up with that? - What? Geez, what is it with everyone and that stupid freaking doll? Excuse me. I'm sitting right here. And Eve is not a stupid freaking doll. Eve is the best doll to ever be created in the history of dolls. Period. You are not a part of this conversation. Yes, I am. I can't believe that you are saying this after everything that we have been through, Grace. Eve is just a doll, and she's dunzo. Buh-bye. Sad story. Can we all just move on? You know what? I need air. I'm not exactly sure what for, but I know that's what people say when they need a moment. Please don't come back. (keypad beeping) Eve A4618 here. How's it going with Gracie Girl?

Eve A4618: Eve, come on now. - Get back. Come back. - Yeah. Listen to me very carefully. If Eve is discontinued, all of us-- you, me, all of the Eve dolls-- will no longer exist. My tummy hurts. I don't think I can do this. And you were wrong about butter. Well, how much did you eat? You know what? Forget about the butter. Now, you went there to help Grace. But in the process, oh, you have to save the Eve doll. Now, do you remember when little Casey lost her mama. Did I throw in the towel? No, I didn't. I shined bright. I shined far. I was a star! I am rooting for you. We are all rooting for you. How dare you doubt yourself! (computer beeping) You are our only hope, Eve.

Because time is running out and then poof. We're gone. Just like that? Is that really how it's gonna happen? Pssh. I don't know. Nobody knows. You just need to make sure that Grace understands what an important part the Eve doll plays in the lives of children everywhere. You only have four days. And if you do not reverse that spell, you cannot come back home to Sunnyvale. - Ever. - Eve: Copy that. Four days, reverse the spell, save our Sunnyvale. You know what?

Are were really going to sit on Santa's lap? Yeah. How else is he gonna know what we want for Christmas? Okay, it's just... a lot has changed this past year. There's been an entire movement that suggests that two women sitting on a powerful man's lap as he offers them gifts while shouting "Ho, ho, ho, ho," it's, it's not exactly PC. Actually, it's just three "Hos." Come on, please. - Please. - Okay. Come on. Grace. Oh, hi. Calum, right? It's Jen Chen's boyfriend? Uh, no, no, not boyfriend. Jen and I are just friends. Oh, I thought you two were like... We're friends. Just friends. Oh, that's good. I mean... Calum, I want you to meet my friend Eve. Best friend. You are really handsome. It would make a perfect match for my Gracie Girl. (chuckles) She says weird things a lot. (chuckles) Thank you. Uh, it's nice to meet you, Eve, and it's good to see you again, Grace. You too. I guess I better get a spot in the line. Oh, well, um, I mean, you can come hang with us. I mean, if you want. No presh. That means pressure. I don't know why I just shortened that. (laughs) - Calum: Yeah. - (Grace chuckles) Look at her. She's so cute and so happy and playing with her Eve doll. Hey, uh, Emma. Come meet my friends. Oh, you know her? Yeah, she's my little sister. What, you think I was a grown man come to sit on Santa's lap by himself? I mean, to be honest, yeah, and I was slightly concerned. Emma, this is Grace, and this is Eve. That's my doll's name. I know. I know her well. Did you know, Emma, that Grace's company makes the Eve doll? And, Emma, don't you just love your Eve doll so much. Wait, you make the Eve doll. Th-That's so cool. Is it true that if you ask your Eve doll for help with something, she can magically make everything all right? Uh-huh. Yeah, no, it is true. You know, Emma... you may not notice that any magic is happening in that moment, but in time, you'll see that your Eve doll made everything just right. Emma, I think we need something hot... chocolate. But not too hot. - Right? (giggles) - Yeah. Wanna get out of here? - Can I? - Go ahead. Come on. - Bye! - Calum: Bye. (laughs) Hey, it's you again. Hi. And it's you again. We'll have four hot chocolates. And I'm gonna immediately begin flirting with you in three, two, one. Your eyelashes are as long as peacock feathers, and your smile shines so bright and so far. And your pecs, they look as delicious as your juicy chicken tastes. Wow. I've never met a woman like you. You say exactly what you want no matter what. Oh, I like you, Chef Hyde. (whispers) A lot. I really like you, Eve. You're truly one of a kind. You're a doll. Ha. I am, yes. Yes, I am. (laughing) I'm gonna get those hot chocolates. That was really sweet what you said to my sister. She's going through a rough time right now with our parents' divorce. Oh, wow, I'm sorry. Yeah, no, she's, she's a really sweet girl. - She is. - Yeah. I am... I'm glad I ran into you again after your... Oh, gosh. The luau? - Yeah. - Oh wow. I'm sorry. I was a lot that day. No. What? No. You were amazing. You were the life of the party. I wish I looked that good in a grass skirt. Oh gosh. Stop. No, it was amazing. On the table. - Wow. - (laughing) - I'm embarrassed. - (laughing) - Thank you. No... - Don't be. It was impressive. I-I'm going through a lot of stress right now, - and that day, I just felt like-- - No, no, don't-- Everybody has stuff going on in their lives that no one else can possibly understand. Wow. Ain't that the truth. - Say cheese! - (camera shutter clicks) Okay! (Christmas hip-hop music playing) Oh, no, no. We don't, we don't eat those. It used to be that you would just come to the mall to sit on Santa's lap, and now it's this whole experience. Eve: (on microphone) Hi, everyone. I hope you're having a marvelous time today at Christmasmania. I know I am. Oh, good God. Someone gave her a microphone. I want to give a special shout-out to my best friend in the entire world.

Certainly hope so. You smell good enough to eat. Way too soon. We gotta go. I want you to be my extra special friend. Bye! What is this funny feeling in my tummy?

I can't stop smiling when I think about him. And I can't stop thinking about him. Which means I can't stop smiling. Just be careful, Eve. Love has way of letting you down hard. Tahlia: Holy Christmas tree! No wonder you called us over. Pretty impressive, huh? We make a good team. You never get a tree. I decided it's time to change that. Oh, my gosh. Eve and I had the greatest day. We went to Christmasmania. - What? - I know. I'll never be caught dead there, but it was actually really fun. Doing, like, the simplest things like riding the kiddie train. You didn't post on Instagram once today. - (gasps) - Grace: I know. I was just living in the moment. It was like... being a kid again. You know what? The tree's missing something. Hang on. (both gasping) Special Edition Christmas Eve. - Yeah. - Oh, my gosh. Lex. Could you do the honors? Oh, it really is a beautiful tree. This mean you're not mad at me anymore? I'm working on it. Okay. I'll take it. Go ahead. (gasps) Oh, my gosh. I remember this day. Your mom sent us to that kiddie camp. Look at that cute kid. I die. I'm dead. No, that was actually the opening of Marathon Toy Store downtown. And I was there. She is right. Look at your Eve doll. She was my special friend. She still is. Oh, you guys are good. (overlapping chatter) Guys, guys, listen to me. Look, I would love to find a way to save the Eve doll. And maybe saving the Eve doll could save the store, but... the fact is the online market has changed the toy industry. Look, the store, the Eve doll, I'm sorry, but they're just casualties of the times. So what? Times and people are changing. Shouldn't the Eve doll change with them? - Tahlia: Hello. - Butler: That's right now. Give the kids what they want. Oh, my gosh. It's so simple. Lex, you just might be the smartest kid I've ever met. Okay, listen. Do you think your friends from school would be interested in taking part in a creative brainstorm? I mean, I can ask. Lex, I wanna do it tonight. - Really? - Grace: Mm-hmm. I'll call everyone I know! (singing) Let's have a slumber party! - Slumber party. - Butler: Yes! - Yes! - (all shouting excitedly) Here we come! Yes! Wait, what's a slumber party? We'll explain later! (all shouting excitedly) All in favor? Devin: It's unanimous. Thank you, all. This was the right thing to do. Thank you for being a part of this. Carter. This is a huge mistake. Yeah, it was close, but we finally got Carter on board. Yeah, I'm just glad it worked out with the voting. I'd hate to have to get rid of Grace the same way I got rid of her mother. (chuckles) Sushi and Poke bowls? These kids are 12. Trust me, they are going to love. I have the pizza hookup if it all goes south. Just saying. (doorbell rings) Are we expecting more? - Mm-mm. - Mmm. I'll get it. Hi. - Calum: Hello. - Hi. You must be Emma, right? Come on in. It's gonna be amazing. - Bye, Calum. - Bye. Be good. I didn't know you were coming. Uh, Eve called me. Of course she did. I mean, I... I'm glad she did. Um... I-I guess I'll be back in the morning, then to pick up Emma? Oh. Okay, yeah. No, that-that's totally fine. Unless... I mean, if you need someone else for a sleepover, I could do a really good French braid. Uh... (laughing) (laughing) No, okay, I'll... I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, bye. Mm-hmm. (sighs) Grace: Um, I know I owe all of you an apology, so... I'm really sorry. Um, as many of you know, I own a toy company, and we make the Eve doll. Well... things haven't been going so well lately, and we really need to make some changes. So... right now at Marathon Toys, um, what we were thinking was-- Grace, why don't I take it from here? Okay. - Hi, guys. - Kids: Hi. Essentially, we get to help make the Eve doll cooler. More representative of the kids we know. And in return, we get to eat lots of yummy food drink caffeine, stay up late, and watch YouTube slime videos. Kids: Oh! The current Eve doll looks like this. And here she is with part one of the makeover. - Tahlia: Wow! - Girl: Oh, my gosh. Is she real? - Yup. - Okay. Now don't go crazy, everyone. Um, this is my friend Eve, and she just, she happens to look a lot like the Eve doll. Hi, everybody. Kids: Hi! I'm so excited to hang out with you guys tonight, and, uh, this is my first slumber party. - Oh. Oh! - (kids giggling) Lex: Like I was saying, the current Eve doll, though very pretty and polished, is limited with just a handful of outfit options. Eve's list of careers are short and uninspired. Bridal Eve. It's not even a career. Beauty Pageant Eve, well, it's just sad actually. But we're taught we can grow up to be anything we dream of being. (all cheering) Let's do this!

Grace Martin, the CEO of Marathon Toys, is being forced out... - Wait. - ...by her own board. - Apparently, the managing director... - - What's going on? ...Devin Drake, is gonna step up. Maybe he can turn this ship around. Have you talked to Carter? He hasn't replied to my text. I'm so sorry, Grace. Reporter: And I question Eleanor Martin's judgment in putting her in this position in the first place. If Grace Martin were my kid, I'd put her over my knee, I'd put her in time-out, but I sure wouldn't give her the keys to my kingdom. - (beep) - (TV switches off) Grace. Are you okay? No, of course she's not okay. She hasn't been okay in a very long time. Grace, I think you know what you need to do. (buzzer sounding) (cell door clanking) (indistinct chatter) (indistinct announcement on PA system) Grace. Mom. I'm sure you heard the news. I have. Well, say something. I mean, you made me CEO, which I can't even begin to understand why. Why, why would you even think that I would want that job? Marathon was your baby, not mine. I was building a business, an empire from the ground up, yes. That took up a lot of time-- (speaking Spanish) Oh, just throw a little shiny object at Grace, and she'll be too distracted to notice that her mother's never around. Well, guess what, Mom? I noticed. All those toys, that stupid little Eve doll, those were all just sad reminders that you loved your company more than you loved me. - Enough, Grace. - And a doll, Mom? A muñeca was my best friend. Listen to me, Gracie Girl. I worked my ass off to give you a better life than I ever had. I am not going to apologize for what I had to do. You might not like all the choices I made. But I made those choices... for you. And now I've ruined everything, right? I've completely undone all your years of hard work. If there's anyone that can pull this company out of the ashes, it's you. You've got what it takes to be a great CEO. You're smart, opinionated. You look after others. You have vision. It doesn't even matter anymore. I'm out. They voted me out. (speaks Spanish) Keep pushing forward, Grace. No one believes in you more than I do. As soon as you start believing in yourself, big things are gonna happen. (speaks Spanish) Ma, do you believe in magic? Like all that stuff you've been telling me about the Eve doll? You got the box I left for you, didn't you? You've got magic in you, too. It's everywhere. Are we allowed to hug? (sobbing) I'm sorry I haven't been to see you. I'm sorry I'm not there to help you. Don't go down without a fight. I won't, Mama. I won't. Announcer: Welcome to the Marathon Toys shareholder's meeting. Hello, I'm Devin Drake... new CEO of Marathon Toys, and welcome to our final shareholder meeting of the year. I'd like to take this opportunity to announce the launch of an exciting new line of video game apps that I know will-- I have some things to say. Hi, everyone. I'm Grace Martin. My mother is Eleanor Martin. Twenty years ago, my mother had nothing. We were barely scraping by. But she had a vision. Her vision was the Eve doll which grew into this beautiful company. But, as you all know, times change, other voices weigh in, and... sometimes that vision can be blurred. Marathon Toys lost sight of the magic, of the idea that a doll can spark the imagination and inspire, that a doll can build confidence and teach tolerance. I know the board voted to discontinue the Eve doll, but... a wise woman told me, never go down without a fight. So without further ado, I present to you Eve 2.0.

None of this matters. None of this matters. She's not CEO. I-I'm the CEO. Devin Drake, CEO. Carter: You know, you really should think about getting a lawyer. All the evidence that you framed Eleanor to climb the ladder at Marathon Toys has been handed over to the authorities. No. I'm afraid your time's up. Devin Drake, you're under arrest for providing false evidence, securities fraud, and insider trading. - You have the right to-- - I know my damn rights. Great. Makes my job easier. Devin: This isn't over, Carter. Wait. Does this mean my mom... She's innocent. I've already arranged for her release. You mother will be home for Christmas. (gasps) Thank you! Grace, what you did up there today... Boss, I'm so proud of you. Thank you. I'll see you in the office. Eve: Gracie. You are amazing. You saved the Eve doll and the store. Thank you for being here and showing up for me. Even after I treated you the way that I-- No, you're my best friend. I would do anything for you. You're my best friend too, Eve. Wait, but where were you? Oh, I was with Hyde. - What? - Yeah. Gracie, what does it mean when a man says "I never saw you coming, and now I'll never be the same." Oh, wow! That man's in love. - What? With me? - Yes, with you, Eve. You know, you seem to have that effect on people. (sighs) Gracie Girl, it's time for me to go. What? No. No, but I'm not ready to say goodbye. Come back to the house and celebrate with us. I wish I could. But Sunnyvale needs me. Woke Eve is blowing up my phone, and she's saying that she wants to stage a march at the Capitol. And Love is Love Eve says that there is this little sweet girl in Arkansas that is hurting so bad that needs to know that it gets better. What you have done is truly magical. But it's all thanks to you. What am I gonna do without you? You're never without me. It's time. Sun of suns... moon of moons... once awakened, now to return. I'll be gone soon. Hyde: Eve. Oh, my God. That was an amazing performance. Amazing. Come on. We gotta go celebrate. Hyde, I can't. I can't go. I gotta go home to Sunnyvale. Sunnyvale? That's in Arizona, right? Look, I'm going with you. - Me and you. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Oh, wait. You need to know that I'm a very busy doll. - Doing very important doll things. - Mm-hmm. Do you think you can handle all of this? I've never been more sure of anything in my entire life. (sighs) I love you, Gracie Girl. (sobs) I love you, Eve. Magic is real. ♪ ♪ Miss Roberts?
