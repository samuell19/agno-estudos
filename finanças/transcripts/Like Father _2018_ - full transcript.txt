Hello. Rachel Hamilton. Yes, thank you for calling me back. Yes, Mr. LeRue told me you were coming in tomorrow. Well, I promise, once you hear our pitch, there will be no doubt in your mind that LeRue is the company to make you America's next favorite potato chip. Excuse me, the world's greatest potato chip. Right. Well, anyways, I'm sorry for calling on a Sunday, uh, but I actually... won't be in the meeting tomorrow, unfortunately, so I just wanted to make sure we had a chance to connect. Mm Why... won't I be there? Uh... - Actually, I'm getting married today. Come on, Rachel. Yeah, I know, it is exciting. I wish I could serve your chips to my guests.

This is a reminder to make sure that the team presents the Cara's Cookies materials tomorrow in the pitch meeting. And make sure that they say it is Whole Foods' top organic cookie seller, and that we created the brand. Uh, what else? - Please ma-- - We have to go. Uh... the... I gotta go. Can I give this... Uh... Wow! Hi, everyone. I'm Frank LeRue. I'm Rachel's boss. And according to the Internet and the state of New York, I am here to join... my star employee... and Owen... in holy matrimony. Now, Owen, from what I've gathered... you are a very smart, kind, adventurous guy. A physical therapist... - a great pasta maker... ...and one of the last remaining in-line skaters. - That takes dedication! Now, some people don't think that there's such a thing as a branding emergency. But if there is... - Rachel... is our EMT. She's committed, dedicated, and inspiring. And now... the good stuff. Will you please join hands? Oh... I'll get it. Okay. Sorry. I can't do this. - I'm so sorry. Oh, God, Rach. - I'm so sorry. Sorry. Owen? Wait. Owen. Uh... just a minute, folks. This is, uh... This is a new thing that Rachel and Owen are trying out. You know, they're innovating. Always. Sorry. I'm so sorry. I know I wasn't supposed to bring it. But... um, please, you cannot do this right now. I know this is insane. Oh, my God. Were you on a call before you walked down the aisle See? That's why we're supposed to be getting married today. Come with me... - Come on. I love you. I really, really do. I can't believe I'm doing this, but I can't have this conversation again. And not here. I wanted this to work... - more than it actually can. Even our wedding can't make you change, and that's okay. It's just not okay with me. Dad? That's your dad? Excuse me. I have to get out of here. I'm a fucking bride, you fucking cocksucker! Good morning. LeRue. Oh, no. Is she really here? I can't believe she's here. Oh! What is she even doing? Awkward. Hold on. Rachel's actually here. I don't know what to say. Morning, Penny. Morning. - Good morning. You know you have two weeks off for that cruise, right? Uh, I do, yeah. Thanks, but I don't--  I don't need it. Hmm. I'm fine. I am. Really. I'm-- I'm sorry about yesterday. That was very dramatic, but, um... You know, deep down, I know it was the right thing, and, uh... I'm moving on to more important things, like the Evie's pitch at 11:00. Did you talk to your dad? Well, you saw him run off. So, no. And honestly, I hardly know him, and I have no idea why he was there. So, it doesn't matter. What matters is that I'm here. I've been trying to land this account for months. So, uh... if you don't mind... I'll just take the next five minutes to prep. Uh-huh. I do not mind. Evie's. From our hearts to yours. You're probably wondering why we didn't talk about how good your chips taste. That's because... any chip company can say that. And they'd be right, because all chips are good. I mean, they're chips, right? But what we think is special about your company, what-- what makes it unique... is you guys. Your chips aren't just a snack. They are an act of love. And here at LeRue, that's the story we want to tell. God, uh... Honestly, when we moved out of Brooklyn two years ago, I never thought we'd be back in New York doing something like this. Oh. We'd just gotten so caught up in the momentum of our draining everyday jobs... ...we'd forgotten how important things like... creating a human connection with our work was. It-- it touches me deeply to know ...that's what you'll be helping us continue to grow. Can we answer any more questions you may have? Uh, it's, uh, not really a question. I just want to say thanks to all of you. I mean, this is all really impressive. Yeah, we know they're just potato chips, but they really are a-- a part of us. So, I hope you'll understand if we take some time with the decision. Yeah. Of course. - Of course. Yeah. Thanks. And, uh, Rachel... Thank you so much for-- for being here. I mean, your new husband must really be so cool - to not have minded you coming in today. Yeah. Oh. Yeah, he's the coolest. Tell him thank you for us. And have so much fun on your honeymoon. I will. That was brilliant. I can't believe she almost cried. That was amazing. Did you see their faces? I gotta hand it to you guys, that was a brilliant job. Really well done. Rachel... incredible. I can't believe I tried to send you home. - It's-- Oh, my... Jeez! What's going on? Get inside! It's not safe! Not safe Oh, my God! No, Owen, I think what you did was completely insane and entirely unforgivable. Yeah, well, fuck you, too. Rachel. It's Dad. I mean, it's... Harry Hamilton, your father. Hello? You there? Yeah, I'm here. What do you want? Look, um... I could probably come up with, uh... a million excuses, apologies... But that won't change the past. You hate me, and you probably should. But I came yesterday because I thought it would be the best day of your life, and therefore, a good day for me to show up. And... I didn't realize that... That what? That... That... well, you know, you were there, so that... plan didn't exactly pan out. I'm sorry. And I realize you... probably don't really want to talk to me right now, or anybody for that matter. But I thought maybe you could use a drink. You don't have to talk to me at all. Come on, one drink. Are you drunk? Can I get a Manhattan, please? - Make that two. What type of bourbon? Woodford.

We thought maybe it was last night because of, uh, how, uh, drunk you were - getting into your rooms this morning. Well, we're headed to the spa. - Nice meeting you. You, too. I need to get out of these clothes. Well, I'm sure there's a golden sarong around here somewhere with your name on it. Why don't you let me take you shopping. My treat. Sure. Okay. This outfit has become one with my body, I've been wearing it for so long. I feel the same way about my underwear. - Don't talk about your underwear. What the fuck is happening?

Whatever you say. - Okay. - Okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Bye. You know... if you want to talk something through, I'm an accounts man, too. How did you know what I do for a living? Google? It's not hard to find out information about anybody these days. My wedding, my job... You read a lot about me, huh? Mm-hmm. Everything I could find. You really never Googled me? No. The service is terrible. I-- - I'm gonna go take a walk, try to-- - I'll go with you. Let me put my shoes on. Maybe we should take our bathing suits that we bought... We can try that surfing thing. I've wanted to try-- ♪ Here we go, here we go Here we go, now ♪ - ♪ Here we go, here we go ♪ Yeah. I think that surf thing's over on the other side of the ship. - Yeah, I just need to send this e-mail. It's kind of important. I'm on the verge of a promotion. - Yeah, I'd be the accounts director.

You got that? Ugh. I feel like Owen set this whole thing up because he knew I wouldn't have service in the middle of the ocean. - Loser. - Yeah. He had nerve wanting the person he was spending time with to actually pay attention to him. Why are you here, Harry? Well, you practically forced me into that town car. You may not remember, - but you were aggressive. - Uh-uh. I don't care why you're on the cruise. Why are you here... after all this time? Why now? Okay. You want to do this now? Leaving you was-- Please don't give me some rehearsed speech with a bunch of lame excuses about why you left. I don't care why you left. I really don't give a shit why you left. Okay? I care while you're here. You showed up on my wedding day. Now you're acting like we're best friends who have spent our lives together. Why? Why now, Harry? Well... - Gabe, my partner... Oh, I didn't know you were gay. No one told me that. You think I'm gay? Not that there'd be anything wrong with it if I was, but... no. Gabe is my work partner. We built a successful business together. But, uh, I had some... some time off from work. And... Gabe always says it's never too late. So, here I am. Oh. So, you had time off, and then your friend told you to come. - Okay. I'm gonna get hash browns. - I wanted to come, too-- - No, that's-- I got extra for the table, and I don't eat them. Too many carbs. So glad you lovebirds could finally join us. Hey. You must be Rachel and Owen. We're your assigned tablemates. This is my gorgeous boyfriend, Steve. I'm Jim. From San Francisco. Been dating two years. That is Shirley and Leonard from Palm Beach. - Hi. Look at their outfits. Are they not the cutest thing? I love 'em. - They are celebrating, get this... - ...their 50th wedding anniversary. - Congratulations. Thank you. Dan and Beth. Second marriage for them both. The right one. And... from Wichita? - Yes. Very impressive, Jim. - You're right. Why, thank you. - Jim's insanely good at remembering things about people. It's... part of what makes him a good therapist, and it's gonna make him such a good dad. We're adopting. Yeah. We're on the waiting list, so, don't wanna jinx it. We're manifesting. If we think it, it's gonna happen. How did you guys meet? Yeah, what's your story? - Mm. Hi, I'm Harry, actually, Rachel's dad. Rachel and Owen decided not to get married, so she invited me to come. You see, I left her... when she was five years old. It's unforgivable. I know. So, I showed up at their wedding a few days ago, and Owen decided to be a little bitch and leave Rachel at the altar. So, I took Rachel out and got her good and drunk, and, uh, we're here. It's nice to meet you all, but we're gonna be getting off the ship when it docks in Jamaica tomorrow. So you see, we have very little time, and um... I'd like to congratulate all of you for your love. That's really great. Can we have a couple of lemon wedges? Thank you. - Hi, I'm Rachel. Hi. Hey. Hey, Rachel. - Nice to meet you. I don't think you needed to know all of that, but now you do, so... Sorry that we're leaving tomorrow. Not as sorry as we are. I mean, this is more interesting than what they got in the brochure. - Honey. - Yeah. I'm sorry. You guys hadn't seen or spoken to each other in how long? - Twenty-five years. - Twenty-six. - Wow. - I see. So, why don't you just stay with us? Yeah. - We're really good people. At least come hang out with us today. Leonard and Shirley were nice enough to get us a private table in the adults-only section of the pool. - No kids. - Mm-hmm. - Don't nothing ruin a vacation like kids. - Mm-mm. That's nice, but no thanks. I have a lot of work to do. May I ask all of you a question? Who here likes potato chips? See? There. Job done. All right? You can stay. Good morning, good morning, good morning, Royal Caribbean passengers. It's Captain Johnny from the bridge. It is an absolutely glorious 78 degrees on this beautiful Tuesday morning. Today, we are at sea as we sail our way to Jamaica, which means lots of time to enjoy our incredible ship activities. So have a wonderful, wonderful day, ♪ You feel the funk ♪ ♪ Everybody getting funky ♪ ♪ I feel the funk ♪ ♪ Gotta have that funk ♪ - ♪ You feel the funk, everybody move ♪ Suddenly, Gabe's bag drops, pops open, and there's a 30-year-old bottle of Macallan he's bought at duty-free. Then we end up rolling all over the floor, plastered. And that is how we landed the Cannon account. I got a plumbing contract for the entire Baltimore school system because I passed a roll of toilet paper to someone in the bathroom I was fixing. I sure do. That toilet paper pass changed our lives. No shit. This story is just as good the third time, and I'm glad you're rich. Thank you for the cabana. But we got something more pressing to deal with right now. Rachel... What's going on? How are you? How are you feeling about the "Owen" of it all? Oh, um... I'm fine. I really am fine. I feel great about it, because... you know, he was never going to let me be the person that I want to be. So, I think it-- it really worked out for the best. Okay. And who does she want to be? I mean, I'm just trying to help. - I don't want our daughter like this. - Don't jinx it. I'm reminded of a time we were trying to pitch a client in Hawaii. And I was allergic to the leis. Oh, you're gonna love this story. Rachel, would you mind grabbing us another round at the bar? Thank you. I love Hawaii. Thank you, thank you. Sit back, relax, while the boys and I play another set. Hi. I'm Jeff. From Edmonton, Alberta. It's in Canada. Hi. Rachel. New York. New York, USA. I get that. I've been there. - Cool city. - Mm-hmm. Big. Big city. I was there for a stag party 10 years ago. You call them bachelor parties. - Mm-hmm. - It was fun. We went to a steak house. It was expensive. - Excuse me. You, uh, here with your family? Husband Girlfriend Solo cruisin'? Can I get a round of drinks - Yes, of course. - I'm-- I'm here with my dad, actually. - Wow. That's amazing. I would only do that with my dad if it was his 200th birthday. I mean, like, a very special occasion. Actually, Jeff, if you can believe it, I was left at the altar a few days ago. Uh, and my dad, who I haven't seen since I was five years old, showed up to my wedding unannounced. We got drunk together the next night, and I dragged him on this cruise that was supposed to be my honeymoon. Pfft. That's fucked up. Well, I, uh... My wife left me a few months ago. And my sister brought me on this cruise to kind of... cheer me up. I guess it's working. I developed a mantra... Well, I didn't develop it, I read it in a book. But it's this: "Yesterday's the past, tomorrow's the future, today's a gift. That's why they call it the present." I've heard it. Pretty good. You heard that? - Yeah. It's-- it's a kind of... Like, it's a well known phrase. Oh. I never heard it. I read it. Oh, sexy rabbi alert. Ooh... Shirley. - Hello, chaps. Oh, hello. How you doing? Good. I'm gonna get back to my dad. Cool. - But we're leaving tomorrow, actually. So, maybe if I see you before then... we can, I don't know, hang out, live in the present... or something? Sure. Uh, yes. Okay. All right. - I would love that. I'll-- I'll find you. Yes, it's a trivia game show. Would you be... Rachel, you're back from flirting. Great. - This is Ginny. Love that name. Mm-hmm. This is Ginny. She's the activities director on the cruise ship, and she has arranged for us to get into the sold-out Gigantic Game Show. You're gonna love it. It's task-oriented, just like work. So, guys, who's in? - Oh! The Taubmans are there. - Mm-hmm. Oh, yep. Oh! Mm-hmm. I love anything gigantic. Oh, I'm excited. I hope they pick Dan as a contestant. He is so good at trivia.

I'd have to before starting over. - Tell her. I've tried, but she's always on that phone of hers. Honestly, I'm starting to see why that son of a bitch Owen bailed on her. You know, Harry, I think you guys are a lot alike. I know. At first, I thought it was great, but I'm starting to think she's a jerk. Look, I've been a therapist now for four months. Okay? So I want to give you my professional opinion for free. You fucked up. You fucked her up. You fucked everything up, and it's all fucked. Hmm. It's all your fault. - Thank you.

Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. Great. - Good hanging. How was I supposed to know you were doing that instead of hanging off of the ship? - I was worried about you. You haven't been worried for 26 years. I am sorry, okay? I got overprotective, but you don't do that! You leave somebody waiting, wondering... worried! We don't even know who this Jeff guy is. Maybe he's some kind of a rapist or a murderer. I was being protective. Rachel! You said you don't do that? Ooh, you don't do that. Oh, you know what else you don't do, Harry? You don't leave your family. Okay? And you don't get to come looking for me in the middle of the night after not looking for me my entire life. - Fine! But we are in a strange place. You don't know this guy. I didn't want him to take advantage of you. Taking advantage of me? Do you mean having sex with me? - I don't want to hear this. You're gonna. Because he had sex with me. Big-time. And I loved it. All three times. You don't like that? You don't like that I am a human being who can have sex whenever I want? Well, news flash, Harry. I've been fucking since I was 17. I'm not gonna stop, 'cause I enjoy it. - I'm not hearing this. - No, Harry, we're bonding. We're bonding, just like you wanted. We're sharing like best friends. Am I making you uncomfortable?

Well, uh... I'm gonna go for a swim. He really did it! All right! All right! Mm... When I was young... I had a vision of how my life was gonna be. Top of my field... Fancy dinners, corporate cards. All of it. I never saw myself with a family. And then you came along. And I was only 24. I quit work for the first few years. You were... the sun in the morning and the moon at night. But something was missing. I started feeling like the dad who was around physically, but wishing he was somewhere else, and... I didn't want to be that guy. Your mom and I decided I should go back to work. Then after a while, with... the trips away... it started to feel like a release. Not from you, but... from the version of myself that wasn't very happy. So that's it? You You had to disappear completely? I guess you were too young to remember. I came back every week. But... ...every time... we had to say goodbye, it got harder and harder. You were-- you were better without me there. And, uh... Finally, I just didn't come back. Sorry. I really, really am so sorry. It was the biggest mistake of my life. I did have a really good childhood. Mom made it seem completely normal... for it to just be me and her. And obviously, I Googled you. I mean... Before the Internet, I looked you up in... every phone book and every memory box, in Mom's closet, and... I wrote you... so many letters that I didn't ever send. - I even prank called you a couple times. Maybe a lot of times, like... around 1994. Oh. Fuck it. Let's just stay. - Yeah. Really. I have the time off work. And, let's be honest, I could use it. - I'm going to go for a swim... - Ah. Nice idea. Oh, yeah! Go! Yes!

Owen and I dated in college, and we eventually broke up and lost touch. And then, I met up with Owen again three months after my mom died. Three months after that, he proposed... and I said yes... because he felt familiar. Because he felt like family. And I did not... want to end up alone... the way she did. I was in a cab when she died... because I had a meeting that ran long. She was alone... again. I'm sorry. I just never should have said yes to Owen. That's all. Fear of loneliness is a very powerful thing. - Thank you. I'm gonna run outside for just one sec. That was really fun. I'll meet you back in the room? We're going to win this thing, Harry. Are you serious? Well, that can't be. A debt collector? Well... Are you sure they called looking for me? Bankrupt? Well, I don't care if I'm his daughter, I'm not bailing him out. Motherfucker! I gotta call you back. I'm not sure why they even have these on a cruise ship. What do you think? I got you one. Because I just got a call telling me that you're fucking bankrupt. - No. Progressive Collection Services in Los Angeles just called my office looking for me. Your bankruptcy payments are late. Because I'm your daughter, they wanted to know where I was. Okay. Is that why you came to find me? Because you wanted to get me before they did? I can't believe I trusted you. Oh, my God, I'm so stupid. I want you out of my room. You are a selfish, cold-hearted, - horrible human being. - Rachel. Was it not enough you left me when I was five? Now you're trying to steal my money. Is all you want to do hurt me? - No! Oh, my God. Know what? You can stay. Stay. I'm gonna sleep with Jim and Steve, - and there's no way-- - Stop talking for two seconds! - In fact-- - Gabe is dead! What? He died. Two months ago. I promise you, I'm not after your money. Yes, I'm bankrupt. And I owe a fair amount. But I promise you, I'm dealing with it. That was not why I came to find you. I am sorry. They should never have called you. My best friend died. He was all I had in the world, and... now I'm alone. So I came looking for you. I'm sorry. That's not fair to you, but... that is the truth. Why didn't you tell me that sooner? I ...you were going through your own stuff, anyway and... Well, honestly... being with you, it was nice just to forget about everything that happened. So that's Gabe? He was always the organized one. We traveled around the world for business, and he would make sure we got where we were going, and when we were supposed to get there. He'd look after the details, you know. Then he started making mistakes. He'd get confused and... repeat himself. When the doctors told us it was early-onset Alzheimer's, we were... He was just 52 years old. We'd lost most of our clients by then, because of the mistakes and... he didn't have any family to look after him. So I quit working... and moved him in with me. Eventually, I couldn't look after him alone anymore. Had to hire some help, and that's where the money went. Anyway... I was gonna spread his ashes in New York, 'cause that's where he's from. So, he was... with me that night when we, you know... So, along he came. I figured... the Caribbean was nicer anyway. Wow. Sorry, I don't know what to say. I don't want your money. I sold my house, and I'm just waiting on some paperwork to go through, and... I've even started packing up. I'm gonna finish the job when I get back from the cruise. - I'll get an apartment or something. A little late in the game for me to get a job-job, but... I can do some consulting. I'm gonna be just fine. You don't have to worry about me. So I guess we should karaoke in Gabe's honor. Yep. Hey, kids. - It's your old pal, Jimmy Deer, here. Love you, Jimmy! Now... while I couldn't be sadder that soon this ship will be docking, Say it ain't so! I also couldn't be gladder... - that tonight we will be rockin'! Yeah!

Jim, what if it's a daughter? Gabe-ette. Gabriella's actually a girl's name. Let's just do Gabriella. - We could do that. It's okay, you two. You don't need to do that. The reason I didn't tell you all about Gabe was because... I didn't want to believe he was gone. He was a good man, a good friend. Loved karaoke. We were each other's family for a long time. I'm sure gonna miss him. So long, pal. Babe... Oh, Jim. It's all right. It's okay. The last thing Gabe would want would be for us to be all mopey. Why don't we all head back inside and enjoy one final night of... unlimited sugary cocktails? - Come on, let's go. Hey, I was thinking maybe after this I would come to California for a few days. Help you move? What about work? I was thinking about work. Actually, it's funny, because I wasn't thinking about work, but... a few days isn't gonna make a difference. I'd like to help. Moving's hard work. I got a lot of stuff. Are you sure? I can handle it. I want to see where you live. Lived. Sorry. Isn't that what family is supposed to do? I guess so. Yeah. Then I'll come to California. I'm gonna go inside. I'll be in in a minute. Hey, Dad? Thanks for coming to find me. Mm Yes. Yes. That is the first phone call I've seen her pick up in days. I gotta admit, she looks like she's doing very well. Oh, she has been relating to us like a human. I hate to brag, but you two are some of my best work. - Oh, Jim. - Okay, it was all of us. Mostly Harry. Thank you. Either way, I hope we have a little girl. Know what? I want to propose a toast. To Rachel and Harry. You guys have made this cruise so much more fun. And it's really nice to see you reconnect. - To forgiveness. To forgiveness. And I'd like to add something else to this toast. That was my boss. I am the official accounts director. Congratulations. Thank you. We got Evie's chips. So... Whoo! Strategy meeting first thing in the morning, And then, up to Upstate New York this week. - Oh. - Mm... Sorry, I think that changes our plan a little bit about me going with you to California, but... - I figured you'd understand. - I do. That's fine. - I'm so-- I'm really proud of you. - Yeah. And I-- I'll see your place in California. - We have a ton of clients there, so... - I will  be out there. - Great! I'll show you my new place. Great. Okay, I've gotta take this. Hi. - Of course. Oh. - Oh, half an hour or so. I'm really sorry that I can't stick to our plan about coming to California. Oh, that's all right. I'm really proud of you. Thanks. Oh, I gotta go. My car is here. I have to run home before I go to the office, so... Um, when's your flight? This afternoon. Any idea when you might get to California? I-- I have no way of knowing, 'cause it's entirely dependent on work. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Look... This week... has been... I'm glad I pushed you in that town car. I'm glad that somewhere in my drunk brain, I wanted to get to know you, and find out you were not as shitty as I thought you were. Thank you. - You're welcome. But this is vacation, and I have to get back to real life. Yeah. - Which I've worked very hard for. - I know. I'm-- I will see you at some point. - Okay. Okay. I really am proud of you. Thanks.
