It's been over 36 degrees Celsius the last five weeks. It's extremely unusual. We fear that the worst predictions about the climate are coming true. To avoid heatstroke you need to remember the following. Drink lots of water, avoid coffee and alcohol as this is diuretic. We'll be reaching degrees of 38 Celsius. It's extremely hot. What's this? Take this. What's wrong? Christian? Christian! Christian! DANNY'S DOOMSDAY The fish are dying. - Did you touch anything? - I haven't touched anything. The heat's destroying everything. I bet you, the power goes off again. Danny, I'll just copy your answers. - Lukas, I'll get them - What's this? Is it Rie? Do you have a crush on Rie? - Just copy my answers. - Relax. Bro's before ho's, right? - Can I see it? - Speak of the devil... Come on. Stop it, Lukas. I'm trying to show Maja something. - It's really nice. - You've been working out. - Drop it. - Nice. See you later, girls. - It's really nice. - Yes. Rie - Let's go outside. - Yes. - Hey, freak! Throw it back here! - Nice hit. Did it hurt, monkey boy? Look at him. Get moving now! Come on. Come on, God dammit! Get him! You're dead, William! Your little brother's crazy. They'll never leave him alone. We're living in the midst of a huge experiment - - that no one is able to cope with or control. Growing cities, deforestation and global pollution. We're altering nature. These climate changes affect all life on earth. As the temperatures rise the animal's habitat changes. Some species relocate, while other species become extinct. We'll take another break. Open up a window, please. Hey. Have one. Thanks. The arithmetic assignment Can you do mine? Sure, but Are you having some sort of party? We're crashing the school's swimming pool. I've copied the entrance key. - Nice. - But It's kind of a closed party. I'm trying to get laid. But if we get an A in arithmetic then Rie's all yours at my next party. And your shit brother is in trouble. Just so you know it. And we're back again. Please keep quiet now. Here's the really interesting part. Some species become extinct, while others develop - - as the high temperatures create new rulers of the food chain. Hey you. Ready for some swimming lesson? - Did you get the key? - Yes. High heels and bikinis. If you dare. If I go nude, you also have to. - No, were not. - I'm so getting laid. - Hey. The laundry room again? - You better believe it. - You owe me a football. - Let me go! This is your secret hiding place. Stand still. - Danny? - I'll kick your ass. - See you later, Danny. - Help me! You again? Go back to your own house, Rufus. Shoo. I'm surrounded by air raid warnings. Send me to Greenland where it's much cooler. No, no. It's not a writer's block. I just can't work under these conditions. No. Sure. Thursday. Deadline on Thursday. Thank you. Rasmus ...? "Even boiling hot water may freeze without its heat source." "And the warmth of a heart turn to ice without love's touch." It's a very tricky thing, trying to describe feelings. - That's how your mom fell for me. - Did she read your lousy books? No. I eloquently told her how I felt about her. You've always been good at showing emotions. It's all about having the guts to just do something. - In order to pick up girls? - This goes for everything in life. You need to learn not to be afraid. No, no, no. What's going on with this world? And the local news. A 23-year-old fisherman has been found dead - - and a 50-year-old tourist has gone missing. Go away. You have your own food. If they do it again, I promise, I'll talk to them. Okay? And why did you kick their ball? They meet on the train. The ticket collector shows up. But she hasn't got a ticket, or That's ridiculous. Why wouldn't she have a ticket? I have no story. Nothing. William? William, dinner's ready! Look, isn't that Danny? Let's drive over there. Hey, Danny. Hey. Where are you going? To a secret party at school. Are you coming? - I'm not invited. - Just come anyways. - You'll get to see Rie's tits. - Maja. - I'm just sketching your cherry. - My what? Your cherry necklace, I mean. I might show up later. I don't know Danny, remember to flush after you take a dump! I don't know what he... - Come on. The guys are waiting. - Yes. We're leaving, but come join us. Sure. - Bye. - See you. - Are you coming? - Yes. Jerk. Shut up, Rufus! MISSED CALLED FROM RIE You have one new message. Received today at 00:13 PM. Hi Danny. Please come. It's really fun. - Who are you talking to? - Go away, Lukas... Did you turn on the water in the tub? Dad? - Dad? - What? Yes, I'm taking a bath. - Haven't you slept at all? - Not with all those crazy dogs. - Listen, I didn't catch it - Good morning. - What's with all the dogs? - Beats me. Have you guys seen Chubby? It's your turn to do the dishes. What's going on with the two of you? - You took the last milk, idiot! - Boo hoo! - He's doing it on purpose. - Stop it! I'll buy some more. Please stop fighting all the time. Go look for Chubby and apologize to your brother. - Apologize? - Yes, you're the oldest. - I didn't choose to be. - You don't get to choose everything. Chubby? Stupid cat. William? Hey! The world is loud enough already. I can't hear anything because of the dogs. I give up. - Try ear plug. - Ear plugs? Dad, the dogs are quiet now. Dad? This works great! Dad, something's outside the window. Get away from there! - The window! Get away! - What? Dad! Dad! - William, run! - Danny, help us! William? Dad? - The windows. - William? - What happened to dad? - Help me! Push! More nails! William, what happened to ...? Come on! Where are you going? We're staying down here. Give me the key. I left him up there. - Give it to me, you idiot! - William. Stop it. Hi. You've called Pemille. I can't answer my phone - - but please leave a message, and I'll call you back. Maybe she's driving. You're not supposed to talk on your phone while driving. Call the emergency service. Come here. What's going on, Danny? They're communicating. We have to find mom. What are you talking about? Look outside. We can't go out there. I want to find mom. She was going to the mall. We know where she is. William Maybe she didn't make it all the way. Why don't you even care? It's not that I don't care. I'm just not a fool. I know she made it. They closed the security shutters. - It's the safest place in town. - Perhaps, but we're here now. - Someone will come and help us. - Who? When? We have no power. Nobody's coming. It's just a matter of time. I don't know. - One day? - I don't know. Be quiet. - One year? - Shut up. I don't know anything. Why do I have to tell you this? You saw what those creatures What they did to dad. - Where are you going? - Up to the fridge. - They'll eat you alive. - We need some food. We can go an entire month without food. What about water then? Help me, God dammit. Are you going, or should I? Rock, paper, scissors. Best of three. - Forget it. - Fine. I'll do it. - Come on. - Shut up. There's nobody. What are you doing? Come on. Danny! William! Open the door, William! Come on! Hit it, God dammit. We'll never get out of here. William, check this out. I don't remember him having a mustache. Hey, look here. Look at that. His mustache touches his nose hair. - Mom must be so embarrassed. - That's why we've never seen this. It gets worse. Look at this. He's fixing the toilet wearing red overalls. How did they ever meet? I mean, mom was hot back then, but dad, he was just dad. I think it was because dad told mom how much he loved her. She simply couldn't resist him. - Shrovetide. - I was dressed as Batman. - And you? - I was Robin. Mom wanted us to be a team. - Was Lukas dressed as the Joker? - Yes. Why aren't there any pictures of you? Because Batman forgot that his helper was locked in the closet. It doesn't matter anymore. Hello? Can you hear me? - What are you doing here? - William. What? - I'm looking for food. - We don't know what he wants. - He may be a cannibal. - The creatures will soon wake up. I need a place to sleep. Please open up. - Have you got any water? - Yes. - We'll open if you give us some. - Sure, just open the door. - No. - We need water. He might have some food. Thanks. Thanks a lot, guys. I'm Adam. - Danny. - William. - Do you have water? - Yes. It isn't my bag. I just... There you go. Thirsty, huh? - Are you alone? - Yes. I was cleaning the gutters My wife was hanging out laundry in the garden. Sune, he was He was I don't think he felt anything. Everything happened so fast. There was nothing I could do. One of them took our dad. Our mom is at the mall. - Have you talked to her? - No. - How do you ...? - We just know. - Have you just been walking around? - I was on the roof a long time. I saw the creatures. - One of them is up there. - It knows we're down here. - It can't come down here. - Are you sure? I'm really happy to see someone else alive. You're the first ones. People can survive out here. Hi Danny. Please come. It's really fun. - Who are you talking to? - Go away, Lukas. - It's the noises. - Danny? - What are you doing? - I've found their weakness. Their vision is poor. They hunt by sound and movement. Go get the duct tape. Move back. We'll distract them. That's how we'll find mom. What are those creatures? I think they come from the ocean. - Why do you say that? - I was up in the kitchen earlier. The creature had these red things. They looked like gills. I don't know. You really wanna go out there? You've seen them. It's a different world out there. You don't know how to get around. But you do. Please come with us. - This is a very long distance. - Then show us the best route. Adam, I beg you. Do you really want to go there? You might not find her. Okay. First of all, William, there's no easy route. - We have to go through the gardens. - We? Yes. We. We have to distract the creatures. You saw what happened to the teddy bear. We can distract them. Okay. Let's find anything that makes noise. - It's not enough. - We'll start here and move down. This way through. We have to look for hiding places. Like outhouses and sheds where the creatures can't get in. We'll push down the button. - One is not enough. - There are more upstairs. This is the way to do it. Let's find all the smoke detectors in the house. We have communication. You'll stay here and distract the creature. Make sure it stays away from you and from us. You understand? We'll come back for you and then we're off. Okay. Stay three feet behind me. - What's this? - What? We've got enough water for an entire month. What? - William, now. - Shit. Now, William. William? William, it's coming. William. Answer me! USED BATTERIES What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? Adam? - It's no good. - What's no good? We're not going anywhere. Do what you want, but we're leaving. You're my responsibility now. I saw my wife's blood on the laundry. - I can't lose my family. - We're not your family. No, you're not. - But we're all that's left. - Our mom is out there! William She's dead. She's not dead. Danny... Look at me. - We're safe down here. - We made a deal. - They'll eat us, if we stay. - Shut up, William. There's no place to go. Move. I'm tired of you, you little brat! Move! You don't tell me what to do. Yes, I do. You need to listen to me. You're rude and tired. Now go to your room! - We need to get out of here! - Come here. - Come here, you brat! - Danny! Let me out!

William? - No. - That's more like it! - He's gone. - We can cook and watch TV now! - William is gone. - What? William is gone. He escaped through the window. Oh, no. What's going on? I have to go find him. I'm his big brother, dammit. Hey! - Adam, you're... - I'll take care of you. You need to stay here. Stay here. We'll get through this. I won't lose you again. I've missed you so much, Sune. Stay with me. Where are you, William? William, can you hear me? Hey! I'm down here! Look down! You've always been good at showing emotions. It's all about having the guts to just do something. You need to learn not to be afraid. Dad I failed. I just let him leave. Like I always have. I know what you mean. I know what to do. I promise you that I'll find him. William? Danny. Let him go. God dammit. What's going on? Danny? - Are you okay? - Yes. - I'm fine. And you guys? - We're here. I thought you'd be dead. Or They broke in through the windows. We managed to escape. - Almost all of us. - Those in the pool We had to leave them behind. - What about you? - I'm looking for my brother. We were on our way to the mall, looking for our mother. He's not here. We would've seen him. Unless he has some sort of weird hiding place. What? It's me! Danny? I understand if you hate me right now. I've never been there for you. I'll never leave you again. I love you so much, William. I've always loved you, okay? If you ever leave me again I'll kick your ass. You got it? I'll be damned. Mutant boy is here. The family is united. - And they come from the ocean? - It's just a theory. I just don't get it. Are you sure you can't stay here? Yes. We need to go while it's still light outside. Did you really see a helicopter? An army helicopter? In that case they'd blown up all those creatures. You keep saying they come from the ocean. - They've already taken over. - It has to be the army. It doesn't matter if they don't come. - Power's back on. - Bravo, genius. I'll get you some water. There's some in Biology. - Come. - They'll be dead in five minutes. They'll get my water. I'll stand guard. I found this, by the way. Thanks. Aren't you going to sketch it anymore? Are you and Lukas ...? What? You've been here a while. Perhaps you Screw it. Just forget it. You're so lame. I'm lame? Do you know, what's lame? For ten years I've been watching you. I've fantasized about you being my girlfriend. It's lame that I've painted over 50 pictures of you. And that I've always wanted to dance with you at parties. And now that the world's ending, I can't even Come. - What's going on? - Listen. - What are you doing? - I have to signal them. Help me up! Hurry up! What's this?

There has to be some more. Wait. I hear another helicopter. Where is it landing? - In the swimming pool. - We have to go get it. - Any volunteers? - Let's draw lots. I'm not doing it.
