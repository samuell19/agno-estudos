Can't reach them on phone as well...! I’m going to slap him! He screwed our wedding trip. Leave... - You won't do anything! Wait till he fixes this mess. Will deal him after that. Did it hurt? Ammu! Aunty, it is a bad omen.. ..to get held up mid way soon after the wedding. Try now... What on earth are you doing! It's your wedding dress! Shame! Move aside, let me get in. Hope there isn't another breakdown awaiting us... Like the dazzling moon in the night sky, And lips as beautiful as the red sky Why can't I take my eyes off her! Have you ever seen or heard of anyone who celebrated like this! When celebrations hits the peak, bliss becomes the rhythm of life, And the village revels in unison! Have you ever seen or heard of anyone who celebrated like this! Good for those who came by one's own, because those who came together got waylaid. And the village got its new share of tales! With their friends and family beside, finally they tie that nuptial knot. And the celebration begins! Like the dazzling moon in the night sky, And lips as beautiful as the red sky Why can't I take my eyes off her? Have you ever seen or heard of anyone who celebrated like this! With their friends and family beside, finally they tie that nuptial knot. And the celebration begins! Finally they tie that nuptial knot and the celebration begins! Finally they tie that nuptial knot and the celebration begins! Sit down. What? Aren't you feeling well? Move aside. Move aside. Not again! How many times have I told these two, to kill that creature somehow! Oh, you are awake... Go... Brush. Breakfast is ready. Chandran? He already had his breakfast. Woke up late... It's that wild boar which created this mess! Don’t you have school today? It’s vacation time. Yesterday on the way, didn’t you see my school? No Often elephants cross our school road. Are there elephants here? - Yes! We have everything here. Boars, tigers, elephants... Everything! Last week a baby elephant came across to have water. It got stuck in the marsh nearby. It stood there helplessly for an entire day, before dragging itself out. Sudha... Let me go then. I would like to call home. You can’t make any calls from here. There isn't any range. What? Bitch! Please have your breakfast and go. Come. How much did I give Unni the other day? 500? Yeah, 500. Auto cost 300, JCB cost... Will you ever get over this? As if you have something else to do! I am the one held responsible by the Contractor. Please give us our share! 1, 2, 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 7... 7... When is this year’s Pepper auction? Could be next month. Last year, our Contractor won the auction for 31 lakhs. He weeps even now claiming that it was a huge loss! As if we don't know! Hey, listen... I have another offer. What is it? Government has issued an order to cut down dried and withered trees. A friend of mine has got the tender. - Anything in for us? Yes, but cutting the dried up trees alone won't do! Just tell us what we must do. Come... Let’s go. See you. I don't know if any of his plans will ever work! Ridiculous! Are you rejoining work today! Shame! Why are you here today itself! Why don't you show the girl around? What is there to see? Some half dead people, some boars and a few wild buffalos! I pity the girl's fate for marrying you! Okay then, I am going to the valley. By the way, don’t skim on our work just because you got married. That boar is persistent on destroying all our crops! If he even dares to destroys this... I’ll catch him and fry, even if the police arrests me! All this wild boar menace is new to me. Ammu said elephants come down here. Mother, do you know how to switch off the Light in our room? Those are his precious belongings. He doesn’t let us touch any of it. I’m not used to sleeping with lights on, so I fall asleep really late. He falls asleep the moment he lies down! When he was a child, he was afraid of the darkness. I don't think it has changed even now. He is always seen working on that Light. Whose is the broken house beside ours? A Tamilian, Sahayam (Helper). But I’ve never seen him "help" anyone. When he left this place for one at the valley, Chandran had asked it for rent. He wanted an unbearable sum. Now, see what has happened! The house lies in ruins! How many families are there in this village? May be around 100-150 families. When I came here, there were over 2000 families! Really? When I was brought here after marriage, this was the most beautiful place I had seen till then. Those days it wasn’t like this. Huge factory buildings, giant machines, buzzing workers, shops and what not. Even the breeze here is filled with the aroma of fresh cardamom and cinnamon. Have you heard the sound of wind blowing in the mountains? Even that has a memorable rhythm... This place was alive with budding tea leaves. Now it’s all gone. One day this place started withering away. Broken and debt ridden, the owner stopped looking after the plantation. Those who had some money left with them, found new homes in the valley. Unfortunate few like us, got left behind, in this wilderness. It’s a bit cold outside. Have kept hot water for bathing. Are you angry at me? Tell me if you need groceries. I am going to the valley tomorrow. Shall I come too? Needn’t. Mother said you like tapioca, so I made some for dinner... Do you come this late every day? The motor at the mill broke down. Went to repair it. If you can repair such things, can’t you fix a switch to the Light in our room. Don't bother. Stay away. I don’t like anyone messing with it. Why? Don't teach me what to do in my house! That Light is the invention of my life! Invention! Even at our festivals we have lights that change color. How dare you! Don't you dare open your mouth again. Mother, - Yes. I am taking lunch for him. I just missed the lottery by 6 numbers! 5000 Rupees! What a waste of time! I thought I’ll bring lunch. Hey, she has brought fresh homemade food for you! Thoran (a side dish) Mizhukk Varatty (a side dish) There is enough for two! I assumed that the Landlord would be here as well. So... Let me see how good your cooking is. Just because I've put some money to start this shop, don’t think of me as the landlord! Your husband is still very much the landlord in here. Why are you roaming around places you don’t know? Don’t you have common sense? I... to bring food... I did not live all these years being fed by you. Don’t you ever step out of the house without my consent. Now get lost! Don’t you know how to behave with a woman? What is your problem? Is it that she came here alone? I know how to make her behave! What the hell is wrong with you! Or is it your father’s ghost returning? I know what this is. Complex. Inferiority complex. That’s it. What is this old woman! Isn't there anything good to eat? Don’t talk rubbish. That girl made everything just this evening. What is there so much to make? You just need to put some rice and that's it! Where were you the last two days? Went to get my dead father married off. Doesn’t anything good ever come out of that mouth of yours! I would like to get this window repaired... And may be put a door here? Why not I build a new house for you! I can’t even change... No one in this forest wants to watch you change clothes! Someone who slept at a corner of a distant relative's house, now wants a palace! Moths have eaten a part of it! See if this is sufficient. Yeah, this is just fine. You don’t be angry at him. He has always been hotheaded. Ramesh is bothered only of himself. For the money he makes, he gets drunk, buys clothes and enjoys himself. He never gave me a single rupee. When his father was bedridden, it was Chandran who took care of everything. Shall I also go for some work? To be a help for him? No! Don’t ask anything about it to him. He might not like it at all. Could you ask him to fix a switch for that Light? I understand your problem, but he won't realise it. Let me try telling him. Give me that hammer. I’ll help you with it. Chandran, your porridge is getting cold. The light outside isn't working. - Shall check it tomorrow. Can’t you put a switch to that Light in your room? It is difficult for her to even change her dress... Bitch! I’ve lost my peace after marriage. She was living in someone’s kitchen after her parents died. Now our home is not safe enough for her! If you mouth her words again, I’ll kick you both out. You can’t kick me out! My husband made this house. What about the debts he made? First him. Now you. I’ve had enough. I just want to leave this wretched land. Will you get peace if I die? Just a minute. He hasn't come home yesterday. He might have slept off at the shop. Can you please check? This is all usual here. No use checking. Chandran! Get Up! You’ve slept enough... Now get up. Life is not the same anymore. Now there is a girl waiting at home. Unable to work from home. By the way, any news from the company representatives? Yeah. They had called yesterday... Asked us to finish our work soon and show them a working model of the Light. I have asked for some time by informing them about your marriage. Is everything alright between you and Sudha? Didn't I take your approval before arranging this wedding? What is your problem now? She is a small girl... That too a lot younger than you. She might have some immaturity of her age. You guys leave, I shall come soon. Oh... You are here! Brother, when you have time, teach him how to tame a girl after marriage! You better leave! - Yeah, I am not staying either! Aren’t you coming? Yeah, I’m coming. Have the workers reached the spot? They reached a while back. - You go ahead. I’ll join. Today is the first day of that contract to cut down those trees. Let me go and check. By the way, I’ve settled your bills at the computer centre in the valley. Do you need any money? No. Tell me if you need! I don’t need anything now. Are you drunk? Don’t make a sound. That wretched animal! It won't allow us to live in peace! We’ve lost all our crops... Everything! That ugly creature! Even the cracker bursting went useless. Everything is gone... Hey Chandran. What is this with the bottles and doll! Try blowing this whistle. - What? Just give it a try. What whistle is this! Doesn’t even make a sound! Blow it close to the bottle and look into the doll’s eyes. Wow! This is so cool! Weren’t you asking what I was wasting all your money on? This is it. What? In making whistles and bottles? Brother, there are lots of sounds around us which we can’t hear. Especially here. This whistle makes such a sound. These bottles turn because of that sound, because their frequencies match. The current produced by this rotation, makes the light glow. That's what I’m trying to make. A Light that works on the current produced by Ultrasonic sounds. As the frequency changes, the colour of this light changes. I am yet to figure out how to make this light last long. That's enough. I can’t follow what you are saying. Get me that diary. But, I now see that there is some sense to all your madness. I trust you. Go ahead. I’m with you! Unni. Is Chandran inside? - Yeah, he's there. Hey... Have you repaired our motor? Haven’t you finished this yet! - Come tomorrow. This won’t do. Fixing your crap is not the only thing I do. Leave. Not you bullshit again! If you weren’t Ramesh’s brother... Huh? What would you do? I shall show him how to fix this! Somehow fix it brother. It’s been days since we gave that motor. He hasn’t done a thing about it. Making a fuss isn't going to help either. Listen to me. Come. Here... Drink this... You’ll feel better. Hey... Look who is here! Is sister inside? She is. Go in. What's this? I made it. It looks good. Shall I show you something? How is it? What's it? Chandran! Is uncle’s daughter getting married? Yes. Where is the groom from? Somewhere north. Will it happen at least this time? Don’t talk nonsense. Lets see. Makes no difference to me anyway. Why are you not saying anything? When are you going to finish that Light? - I don’t know. Again the same thing! We promised to give them a working model by the end of this month. What am I to do if you keep saying this! - It’s you who gave the word. What! How dare you talk like this to me! What else should I say? If the company accepts your model, all your problems will be over. The world will know of your invention! You can build a new house in the valley. That too a fantastic one. Yeah... I too will get some money out of it. So somehow you get this done! I’d like to go home. Mother has approved. - Who? I make decisions here. Not her. You are not going... I’ll go home and... - Home? Which home? Whose home? Your mother is no more. You don’t even know who your father is. Then to which home are you going to? First find out who your father is and then we can think of the rest. Whoever my father may have been, he knew how to love a woman! I’ll finish you here. Once that load too is sent, we’ll get a hefty payment. Where are you going? - For a dip in the stream. You come here a moment. You need to stop wasting time. You should get married and settle down. I can see at home how one "settles" down after a marriage. That is nothing. Once there is a baby in the house, he’ll change. Your mother always keep saying this. She has gone crazy! Go home brother...! Don’t worry. He better not mess with me. Give me the glass. Did you call Unni? Who is going to call him! Come here you bitch! You bitch... All your pain will vanish with this. My husband also used to beat me up when I was your age! Memories of that pain are still fresh in my mind. Chandran grew up watching that. But what happened in the end? When my husband was sick, he needed me to take care of him. Couldn’t even get up on his own. I think during those days he repented his deeds. You shouldn’t hate him. After all, you are a woman! As far as possible, try not to make him angry. Only problem is his hot headedness. Else he is very loving. Come, come inside. Stay with your sister for some time. O dear twilight... In the winds of grief, don't fade far away. Hidden somewhere far away, You are like a painful melody... The silence inside me, stands detached, killing my spirit... Which sky can shed soft rains,.. ..in my heavy heart gently? In the walks of dark, when I stand drenched in tears, Which moonlight blinked its first rays on me? Which symphonies filled my heart? When even these present days of mine... Gets withered away in the embers... Which harmonies gently healed my wounds? Which symphonies filled my heart? Hey! Hey! Place the wood on the other side. To load it to the truck. Unni, come here. You know what to do. Start the trip only at night. Brother, everything is safe, right? The contractor has dealt the matter at the check post. It’s not that brother. Go and work. Go. Don't waste time chatting you fools! Get it done. Quick. Don’t take this personally Chandran. This is not going to work. I invested money believing in you. It is not the company’s requirement. It’s ours. I’ll wait for another week. I've waited enough. If you can’t get it done, tell me. What other option do you have? Are you messing with me? You give me what you’ve made so far. I'll get someone else to finish it. Hey! Ramesh has dug the boar trap. Close it after putting those bamboo sticks. What is this? A trap to catch that wild boar. How? At night when it comes to eat our tapioca it will get on top of this. Then? Then, it will fall into this pit with a ‘thump’. When those sharp bamboo sticks pierce his body, it will cry out loud. Won’t it die then? If it doesn’t let us live, we should just finish it off. Won’t the police catch you? Even if a human dies here, no one will come this way. It's a hailstorm. You go and sleep. Go sleep. Scorpions have come out after the rains. They are poisonous. Be careful dear. I’m going to my brother’s house day after. His daughter’s wedding is approaching. I will ask Chandran to go there with you. What is it? A scorpion. Careful. It is poisonous. This can’t kill anyone! They are out after the rains have started. Hey, Chandran. Isn’t he up yet! Dear, isn’t he here? Come inside brother. Finally! You have fixed it! Fantastic! Just wait and see! I’ll go tomorrow itself to meet the company people. Everything is going to be great from now on. Don't you know how to treat a guest? Useless! What is this? Nothing dear. Nothing. I’ll get some liquor for the evening. Brother, why aren’t we opening this? Yes. Yes... Go On. It was difficult to get the stuff. He was relentless for foreign brands today! Today is a very important day for me! Oh yeah! Pass me my glass. Enjoy! It's worth every penny! Hey Madhu, let's make this a celebration. What was that song of yours? "Anthi kadappurath"? (An old Malayalam Song) Sing. Brother... I will just come... Where are you going? He might want to take a piss! You! Haven’t I told you not to touch that? Bitch. What is going on? - Ignore. What is he doing? - That is all usual. You sing. Shall I fix you another drink? Brother! Do you want another drink? Rice is kept on the stove. Do pay attention to it. I’m going to the wedding house. Will be back before night. Are you coming or not? - Coming, coming. Then come! Take care. Chandran! Chandran! Where is he? Is he still asleep? He is. Should I call? Hey! Get up. Why are you still sleeping? We need to go. Come quick. Is the gas open dear? Is there something on the stove? The water might have over flown. Open that kitchen window and door quickly. It might be raining at the mountains. Don’t go into the stream. The flow will be stronger than usual. You both have to go to uncle’s house tomorrow. The wedding is nearing. They all had helped a lot for your wedding. Your cousins Rateesh and Biju have arrived. They asked for you as well. They are yet to meet her also. So you have to go. Will see. You have to go! Otherwise what will they think! Dear, take this umbrella. It’ll rain. For the hillocks to flower, There comes one from the unknown. Sprouting like a shining dream. For my eyes to see, For me to lock hands, I need you like a shadow to go far and wide. I came to flow like a river, with the dings of your anklet pampering me gently. I came with high hopes, to touch the clouds. Just like a feather in the light wind. For my eyes to see, For me to lock hands, I need you like a shadow to go far and wide. Words that rained like dreams, is dripping again on my path. By lighting a lamp in my eyes, I pursue the roads that are yet to be traveled. The time when birds coo in the dripping branches, Lend me your shoulder and join me in my life journey! Come dear. Shall we leave? Why the hell did you come here now? You start. She might have got bored. Oh no. It’s difficult to go back in the night. That's why... If being bored is her problem, she’ll dance for all of you. A dance! Now that's what we were missing. Brother, if she has to dance, you will defenitely have to sing! That shouldn't be a problem. My dear, if that's a deal please show us a step. At least then we can hear this moron sing a song! (Old Malayalam Folk Song) What? Are you deaf? Didn't I ask you to dance! Chandran! Don't you dare do this nonsense when drunk! Don’t you dare teach me how to behave with my wife! Get lost. Just get lost I say. Hold me. Hold this. Help! Where is that old woman? Mother went to the neighbor’s house. So many times I have heard your painful screams from this room! But then I used to blame him. Now I realise that I was wrong! Anyone would want to make you cry out loud! Do you think you can survive in this house without yielding to me? Have you seen death Ramesh? That too right in front of your eyes? I have. My own husband’s death. He was screaming a lot louder than I did. For help. Even as I watched him die, I did not flinch. Neither was I scared. You bitch! Lower you voice! Mother will be here anytime...
