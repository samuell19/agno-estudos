Father. Have you been here all night? It's that last act. It's more likely this. Come to bed now. I must sweep the room. Sanger's been having a night out again. It's your fault. You know what the doctor said. There it is. If he wants to kill himself, I can't stop him. You should have hid the bottle. That's right. Blame it onto me. I never knew such a house. Lena. Lena. Lena. Get up you rat. - Rat yourself. What's the hurry? I think Lewis is coming today. Lewis is coming today. Where is my chemise? Hey, Tony. Give it to me. I want it. I want to go and meet Lewis. No you don't. Let her come, Lena. She can drive the car. That sweet little thing. A sight for sore eyes. He's our friend. Not hers. Oh, day of joy. He is all of our friends. Hurry up. I want to go and watch for the train. Excuse me, sir. You are making a visit to Albert Sanger? The third-rate composer, huh? Yes. I also. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Trigorin. Kiril Trigorin. Dodd. Lewis Dodd. It's not possible. You are Mr Lewis Dodd, the young composer? I am enchanted. You are the dear friend of Herr Albert Sanger? I also. I design for him the ballerette. In his opera Aqaba. He asked me to stay with him. He does that to everybody. And all the family is at home now? Not all. There isn't room. But how many? Well, there is madame. - Madame? You mean Mrs Sanger? If you like. Then there is half a dozen children. They are the children of madame? No. Not all. Only one. Oh. The others have another mother? Several. I dare say some of them will come to meet the boat. The boat? We must go in a boat also? We were counting the days. - I hope we seem in good health. It will be alright now you've come. What's that? That is a guest. - Another? We'll put him up in the bathroom. - Come and be introduced. Mr Trigorin. This is Lena Sanger. And Miss Theresa Sanger. Make your curtsy, my cherished one. She is the pick of the bunch. Though she doesn't look it. I am most delighted. He dances in a ballerette. There is no dancing in it. - No. I make steps for dancing. I design for Sanger the ballerette in Aqaba. You've brought a lot of luggage. Are you staying long? - Yes. If it is permitted. If it's not, we'll change it. Let's all go into the house. Don't go without me. - Come on then. Jump in. Nobody is stopping you. You can sit in front with Lewis's favourite family child. Most delighted. Have you finished that charade for Sanger's birthday? Nearly. - What's it called? 'Breakfast with the Borgias'. It will be a hell of a time. We've only three days. Mr Sanger won't like it unless it's done right. I couldn't get the beastly duet right. Beautiful. Enchanting. Please do repeat. I don't like the change to a minor key here. We've got to have some sort of change. Why don't you flatten the A, darling Louis? How can I flatten the A, darling Tessa? I don't know how, but flatten you must. Look. Are you composing this or am I? All of us, darling Lewis. It's a syndicate. Is this what you mean? No. Not flat like that. For the love of heaven, stop this noise. You'll have to put up with me today, Mr Trigorin. Albert is feeling poorly. Madam, you are too kind. Herr Sanger. He is not well? He's not feeling quite himself. That's what I meant. Why couldn't you have done it without all this fuss? But that is Sanger. Perhaps I go up and pay my respects? I shouldn't if I were you. Until he sends for you. Come for a walk in the meadow. I didn't do so badly. It's different for me. My mother was only a peasant. The girls are ladies. I'll speak to Sanger. You know, they ought to go to school. No money. Haven't they any relatives in England? - Yah-yah. They have an uncle who's a professor or something at Cambridge college. You don't say? Let's get hold of Birnbaum. He's a good friend. Always forks out in an emergency. I'm not so sure about that. You know Tony has run away? I rather suspect Jacob Birnbaum had something to do with it. Jacob Birnbaum? - Yah. You mean she ran away with Ikey Mo? It's very well for you to laugh. But I wish I knew where she was. Never shall I understand you. For a whole week you have been pleased to spend my money. Eating, drinking, the opera. That's right. Boast about it, Mr made-of-money. It's only your wretched money that gets you any friends ever. It has brought me some things I desire. You swinehund. Who shall pay for it? You are no more than a beggar. A woman who owes me. Antonia. Hey. I am going to walk home. But it is too far. It will take you all day. I don't care if it takes a week. Goodbye. Tony. Are you back? Wherever have you been? Munich. In Munich? Not with Ikey Mo? Hmm. Him? I bet you can't spit it as far as that, Lena. Did you have a nice time? Oh yes. A lovely time. Anything I wanted I got from him. Last night we had vol-au-vents, lobster and ice-bomb. Ike had saddle of mutton as well. No wonder he's so fat if he eats all that. So I told him. I said so in a restaurant once at the top of my voice in seven languages. So that all the people heard. He wanted to give me a dressing case with gold fittings. I said, no thanks. I have a perfectly good case that belonged to my mother. An English lady of very good family. Liar. - It's true. He was quite annoyed. He couldn't bear to see his wonderful money wasted. The fat pig. Tony. If you hate him so. Why? - Yes, why? I don't know. I don't know. Come on, Lena. Supper. You don't happen to know where Tony is I suppose? Tony? Isn't she here then? A young lady is lost? No child of mine I'll have you know. One of Albert's. We're not any of her children. I'll say. There are far too many children in this house as it is. Susan, you've been at the jam again. You'll be sick. Stop slapping my child. Let's chant for Sanger. We want Sanger. We want Sanger. It's enchanting. Such youth. Such vitality. Where has Sanger gone? We want Sanger. We want Sanger. Where has Sanger gone? We want Sanger. Now finish quickly, my poppets. We have to rehearse the charade. First with the Borgias. Lena. Jacob. Where is my part, Lewis? - Here you are, Tessa. Roberto. Trigorin, you are the pope. - But I cannot sing. Sanger expects that every guest this day shall sing. What about my baby? I don't see why she shouldn't be a part of it. If I have to have that little brat in my opera I'll tear up the whole thing. Alright. Alright. You can be a page. Lewis. Please, no words? No. You make them up as we go along. Sing Vittorio, Vittorio over and over. So you came back. Yes. I have come back. May I ask where you have been? She's been somewhere with Ikey Mo. I heard her telling Tessa and Lena. You leave my child alone. - Look here, Linda. Come over here, ducky. Tell your mother all you've heard. She is a filthy little liar. Her father shall hear every word. Every word. Albert. Linda, let me explain. - Explain? No. You can't get round me like that, Jacob. It is disgusting. It Sanger has any self respect he'll turn you out. You're not fit to live in a respectable house. Shut up, Linda. This is no respectable house. Isn't it? We'll soon see about that. Wait until I fetch Sanger. You let me go! Well? Look at her. Look at her. She came back. Are you pleased? What do you think she's been up to? You ask Mr Jacob Birnbaum. He owes you plenty, doesn't he? Well, he's getting a bit of his own back now. He's been away with the child. Well? A little busy. She has been so anxious to see Munich. And I am very happy to entertain the daughter of my old friend. Very friendly of you, Jacob. I suppose Tessa will be taking a trip to Munich next. Why did you run away like that? It's Tony. Oh. Don't you think Jacob is rather fat? My dear Tessa. What? Nothing. Only I don't like to see babies I rocked in the cradle growing up in this place. Growing up is not very nice. It's not. You know. You ought to be in school. Nice little girls should be shut up until they're thirty-five. We're not nice little girls and it's too late to turn us into them. The girls at school have faces like suet puddings. You have to walk two and two. You don't really want me to have a face like a suet pudding, darling Lewis? You could never have a face like a suet pudding, darling Tessa. That is what school might do for me. - Quite so. You'll come out a perfect lady. You'll like me when I'm a perfect lady? - My dear. When you come out you'll turn up your nose at men like me, Ike and Trigorin. No. Indeed I won't. - Yes you will. And quite right too. I know. You'll live in a beautiful house. With a front door and a back door and all the usual offices. And you'll have it hot on Sunday. Cold on Monday, hashed on Tuesday. - Have what? Mutton, my cherished one. Ladies do. Idiot. Now listen. I may go to school. I'm beginning to see points in it. But if I do. I shall always .. Always be thinking of you. When I come out I shall come straight back to you. So there. Lord save us. You mustn't do that. The sheer waste of a beautiful education. I've given you up, Tessa. See? You must learn to disapprove of me as fast as you can or you'll never prosper. It's unkind of you to say that when you know how much I love you. It's a mistake to get too fond of anyone, Tessa. Just you remember that. Don't go getting fond of any unnecessary people while Lena and I are at school. Be as fond of us as you like. But don't .. Don't what? Get married. Or be put into prison. Or die. Or anything. I promise. Goodnight, my dear. Tessa, I'm frightened. - What is it? There's a funny noise in Sanger's room. He must be ill. - Perhaps he's just snoring. No. Listen. We ought to go in. - He'll beat us if we do. Let's get Linda. No. We can't. Come on. [ Scream! ] Lewis. Kate. Tony. Lewis. What's all this noise about? Go away. Go away. He is dead. Lewis. Lewis. Please come quickly. I'm faster than you are. Then wait for me. There's the steamer now. Hurry up or you won't be in time. In time for what? To meet your cousin Florence. I don't know why you had to go swimming today of all days. Now then, come on. Hurry up. Mind you don't go rushing up to the wrong old lady. Leave it to me to pick her out and then come up and make your bows nicely. I believe that is really her. He would know. Excuse me, but are you the Sangers? I am your cousin. Lewis. How do you do. This is your uncle. Charles. - How do you do, my dear? Really, Lewis. You're as blind as a bat. She is over here. Lewis Dodd - Miss Churchill. How do you do? You wrote to me, didn't you? A postcard. - I remember. I wanted so much to meet the composer of that symphony. It was good of you to write. It was very good of you to come. - Not at all. I'm simply longing to see the house. But you can't see it. You had better go to the hotel. Why not? Isn't there any room? It's not that. But you would not .. Like it. - I should simply adore it. Thank you. What for? - For the flowers. Thank you. Now you can go and get me a vase to put them in. Whatever next. Excuse me. Dr Churchill. Good morning. - Good morning. Allow me to introduce myself: Birnbaum. Jacob Birnbaum. A friend of Sanger's. Another? You'll never see your money, you know. I have not come to ask for money. I have come to give it. Bless my soul. I wish to make provision for these poor children. Tony, please. Roberto. Roberto. That woman again. She's left home? - Not she. It doesn't occur to any of them to go. That Russian seems to be a fixture too. Trigorin? - Yes. I have the idea. You send him away and she will go too. He is her only hope. I'll tell him quite plainly that he must go. Trigorin. Auf wiedersehen. Goodbye. - But I am not going. I am afraid you are. Tell them all. You wish that I go? - Yes. The house must be sold. The doctor wishes to take his nieces to England. I understand. It is better that I go. I wish to leave some money. For the eating and the clothing of these helpless orphans. Kate. Kate. Is that you Kiril, my precious? Linda is hungry. In a moment, ma Cheri. I am making arrangements for my departing. Your party? What do you mean? I go to Vienna. A telegram has come. Then I shall go too. You? Yes. Me. You think I don't know when I'm not wanted? I'm not the sort to demean herself by staying after those sort of innuendos. As a matter of fact, I've had my boxes packed for some days. The bateau. The bateau. And that's that. If she really is going I shall have to pack for her. We're all going to help. I pray you to give this little sum. I go now and pack my trunks. It's the first time I've had these on since poor Albert was taken. Just a minute. You won't be leaving just yet. Will you? What are you working on now? Nothing much since you came. It isn't possible. Oh, go to hell, Roberto. Can't you go another way? Si, Signore. Si. Sorry, sir. All this packing must have gone to my head. Hello Kate. Let me take some of those. Lewis, so kind of you. Mind the hat box. It's got Linda's cat inside. Good lord, what a set. Come along, my pets. If we're turned out, we're turned out. There is the end of it. She is crying for her daddy. The poor little mite. You wouldn't think to see her now that she was Sanger's favourite child. Sanger's favourite child. Good riddance to the lot of you. You can't take that. It's mine. - It's not yours. It's mine. You give it here. - It belonged to my mother. I know what I'll do with it. It's mine now. Your dad gave it to me. Give me it directly. - I won't. You're a thief. It came from my darling mother. Tony, let her have it. I'll get you a better one. Thanks for nothing, Mr made-of-money. It has my mother's initials. 'Evelyn Napier Churchill'. I'll not leave this house without it. You call me a thief? How better are you, I'd like to know. You turn me out. You treat me like dirt. What's it to you? How much better was your mother? - Don't answer her, Tony. She's a dreadful little slut and no better than what she ought to be. You ask Mr Jacob Birnbaum. Take your bag and go. You'll miss your train. I think I am going. I would not stay here for anything in the world. Come along, mother's own. Never mind. Don't cry. You're going to a lovely new home with uncle Keith. Drive on, Roberto. You dirty little bitch. Tony, don't cry. I will buy you a better one. If you do, I'll throw it into the lake. I won't be kept by your money. But there must be somebody to take care of you. You should get a husband who will be kind to you. I would rather be married than go to school. Could you not marry me? I love you. I will try to make you happy. Ike, you are drunk. - I am not drunk. I mean it. You'll have all you want. I will buy .. - Oh, go away. Don't ever speak to me again. Tony. Can you tell me why you are still so angry? Because you're so stupid. You keep on boasting about all the wonderful things you want to give me. Yet you don't seem to have thought that I could give you anything. What's that you say? When I came to M?nchen it was because I loved you. You .. you loved me? Of course I love you. I'd have come just the same if you had been poor. I think I can't forgive you for trying to buy me. Antonia. You are never crying, Ike? Must you call me by that name? Well then. Jacob. You must not cry. You can't help being stupid. Can you forgive me? I keep on forgiving you. You keep on making me cry. Will you marry me? My heart's dearest. Poor Ike. - No. Now I don't have to go to school. Hurrah. Tessa, Lena. Tessa. Lena. I'm going to be married. Couldn't we all marry someone? I'll marry Roberto. I'm sure he is very obliging. - You are too young. Juliet was younger when she married Romeo. She was Italian. - I'd be Italian if I married Roberto. Girls take the husband's nationalities. - Idiot. That has nothing to do with it. Tessa can ask Lewis. What's the matter, Tessa? I'd ask him but he likes you better. I'm too young. - You can ask him anyhow. No I couldn't. I am too old. Too old? You said you were too young. - I did. Hear me. I am both. I am too young for some things and too old for others. Why should you be too young for Lewis? You suit him better than other tiresome women who'd always be bothering him. Would I? Look. [ Tinkling cowbells ] Why is that cowbell sometimes 'A' and sometimes 'A flat'? Because it is a different .. cow. He began stammering the moment he saw her. He always stammers when he's in love. He never married any of the others. I didn't know when first she came that she was a serpent in sheep's clothing. No use in crying about it. Have you got a hankie? Let's water this primula with our tears. It might change its colour. Or something. Bye-bye, Tony. Send us a postcard. I've been engaged to go to Milano to study for the grand opera. You'll be a better singer than your mother. Well, that's that. Who's coming to the dance then? Don't run away. We may not get the chance to be alone again. Perhaps that will be just as well. I .. don't quite understand you. You are not like other women. No two women are alike, are they? They are .. all alike. If you were any other woman I'd say that you wanted me to make love to you. I do. You do? Lewis. You do love me? From the first moment that I saw you. And you? From the first moment I saw you. What a child you are. You're not a bit older than Tessa. And I thought you were so superior. Don't cry, sweet one. Nobody is going to hurt you. We'll be married. - No. What are you laughing at? - Lewis. Confess. You've only just thought about marrying me, haven't you? No. Not at all. I should have mentioned it before. We'll be married as soon as possible. I am so happy. Hi, Roberto. Not yet, Lewis. - Why not? He is used to this kind of thing. Roberto. - Si, Signore? Roberto. [ Italian language ] Lewis. Let's take him back to London with us. We're not going to London. - Yes we are. I know exactly the house for us. I'm not going back to England. Promise not to take me back there. Ever. Well, I won't promise. Then I .. won't. Won't what, Lewis? We won't go to England after we're married. What did you say? We're going to be married. I told her not to eat so many ices. - Tessa. Tessa, my dear. Go away. Go away. We don't want you. He is Tessa's. He belongs to Tessa. [ Whistle ] Lewis. Bring in the luggage, Roberto. Now, darling. I want to show you everything. You have no taste. She is good. I am sure she is. I hope you'll like your Steinway. It used to belong to Melba. What a lovely waste-paper basket. Do I sleep on that? - No, silly. Upstairs. Love. An ideal home. Better than the Daily Mail exhibition. Roberto, you must not come into the bedroom in London without knocking. Excuse, Signora. Another time you must bring them in on a platter. Who's it from, Lewis? Lewis. Aha. Let me see. - I said so. They aren't happy. Nonsense. School days are the happiest time of one's life. Don't rush, girls. Don't run. Keep quiet, girls. Run. She says she has .. A valvular lesson. A valvular 'lesion', she means. It's quite alright as long as he does not strain her heart. We must take them away at the end of the term. We'll do nothing of the sort. - At least, take Tessa away. It's worse for Tessa. She was very nearly perfect before she went there. What do you mean, 'very nearly perfect'? Give me that letter. - Why should I? It's mine. Give it. - I won't. As Tessa's guardian, I've a right to see her correspondence. Give it to me or you'll be sorry. Lewis, you're hurting me. - I meant to. You beast. You're not better than Sanger. Sanger wouldn't put up with half the damned nonsense I've stood for. Isn't that so, Roberto? Si, si. All damned nonsense. Roberto, what are you doing there? Please. I watch you fighting with Lewis. I hope you realise what it means to get Sir Barthelemy Pew for our first party. That distinguished old duck? Quack, quack, quack. He is very influential. I shall get him to give us an approval for your symphony when it's finished. 'I believe in sanity in art'. Quack, quack, quack, quack. You don't suppose I asked him because I like him? Why then? Darling, I'm only trying to push you. I'm not a perambulator. - Really, Lewis. You are impossible. I told you that before you married me. Hurry up and change, darling. It is getting late. Don't get married. Or be put into prison. Or die. Or anything. Who is there? Lena. Where did you come from? - Hello Lewis. We ran way. We had to. Tessa. Is that Tessa? Let me look at you. Yes. It's me. I've come to lay my bones among you. Oh, Tessa. Dear Tessa. How long it has been. Longer than the longest book. Lift up your head. Kiss me. Well, well, well, well. We can't possibly go back. We bore it in silence. No. Not in silence. It's high time you ran away. Send them a telegram saying you're not coming back. Hurray! Oh, eatables. May we? We've had nothing all day. - Help yourselves. Florence is having a party. She's going to turn me into a successful composer. Are you doing any writing, Lewis? - Yes. The symphony is finished. It is? Hurray. Why have you got such a large house? - It is not my house. It's my wife's. Why didn't you tell me the symphony was finished? Hello Florence. What does this mean? - We thought to pay you a little visit. You did, did you? That was exceedingly naughty of you. You must return to school at once. But Florence. It's too late tonight. Goodness, Roberto. You do look lovely. Robert is very clean now. Not so comfortable. Please let us come to your party, Florence. You don't know how to behave. - Yes we do. We've been to many parties. Either they come or I don't. So choose. Very well. They'd better come then. Come on, you Sangers. Sir Barthelemy, so good of you to come. Delightful, my dear. Delightful. I'm so sorry Lewis isn't down in time to greet you. You know, he's been working hard until the very last moment. The new symphony. However. It is finished at last. - Really? How delightful. I want to have a little talk with you. I'll talk with you about it later. - Delightful, my dear. Lewis. Lend me your comb. Come and fetch it. Oh blow. I've got a ladder. Well, ten minutes effort gave me this face. Florence in her wisdom gave me this dress. They don't understand the value of teamwork. It's not your beauty that will get you into trouble, my poppet. Now you are here, you might as well tie my tie. Imagine having a separate room just for dresses. Jolly unsociable. If you're washing and dressing it's just the time you want someone to talk to. Now then. Face the music. Quick march. Left, right. Left, right. That was charming. Will you play again later? Ike, the symphony is finished. - Wunderbar. Now you must fork out and give me a concert. Come, Lewis. You're neglecting everyone. I want you to meet Sir Barthelemy. Quack, quack, quack. - Darling, do be tactful. He carries a great deal of weight in some quarters. He does indeed. Here he is, Sir Barthelemy. - How do you do. I've heard quite a lot about you, young man. Oh, Mrs Lambert. I want to sing one of Sir Barthelemy's little songs of the circus. My husband will play for you. I am afraid I can't. They are .. much too difficult. Shall I sing? That's an idea, Tessa. Come on. - Of course not. How absurd. Mrs Lambert. Can we have number two? About the performing seal. Such fun. Now, please everybody. I hope you realise that you've not only spoiled my party. But you have done Lewis a very bad turn. Why are we here? We're from an older world. A colder world. A bolder world. Quicker. Allegro. For you don't know and we don't know. Alley-oop, Caroline. Off the barrel, Joe. Three times nightly. Round and round the ring. Three times nightly. God Save the King. I'm terribly sorry. Make your curtsy, Caroline. And hats off, Joe. And what the hell we're here for, we don't know. Supper. Supper, dear. Never eat it. Let's be off. Sir Barthelemy has left. It was a mistake ever to come here. Well, Tessa. Charles, my only uncle. What a sight for sore eyes. Are you coming to Lewis's concert? - Of course. Son-in-law conducting his own symphony. The experience of it. Will you have tea with your only niece? - Yes please. I am your only niece in a manner of speaking. Now that Lena went to Paris to study dancing. How long are we keeping you at Strand on Green? Well. I'm going to a finishing school if I can ever pass the wretched exam. If school doesn't finish me .. I suppose I shall be back here off and on until I die. As a guest, aren't you a little anxious not to outstay your welcome? Yes. What is a guest, do you think? A person who is invited. I said they'd be tough. Men like them. Charles. Children are forced to be someone's guess, aren't they? That is part of the undignified state of being a child. You call yourself a child, young woman? No. But Florence does. What is to become of you? I've no vocation for anything it seems to me. Don't tell me you're feeling tragic. Most people think I am comic. Hello, father dear. Here already? I hope they've given you some tea. Thank you. Tessa, don't blow on your tea like that. It is so vulgar. - Sorry. Why do you drag your hair back in that unbecoming fashion? It's quite high enough as it is. You should try to cover it. Personally, I like the way she does her hair. I admire it mostly in the opposite sex. Ikey Mo has got a bairn. Like himself it has a charm. Girl or boy? Oh. I forgot to ask. - Don't tease me. Lewis, you can't possibly. You must rest before the concert. Rest, be hanged. Must be in at the birth of another Sanger. How are you, sir? Come on, auntie Tessa. Ikey Mo has got a bairn. Like himself it has a charm. Lewis must not go. I won't have it. It will only upset him. You can't stop him. He's fond of anything that's Sanger. I think I'll go with them. And take some flowers for Tony. My dear, you're heading straight for disaster. What do you mean? Lewis is very fond of Tessa. You should respect that affection. Tessa has bad blood in her. She'll wrong us as fast as ever she can. I sometimes wonder. If already .. - My dear. You're letting yourself go to pieces. I never thought you'd take her part against me. She is not to be trusted. Oh well. If you don't take care, you'll bully them into making a bolt of it. Lewis couldn't. He wouldn't. I must go and see what has happened. Tessa. - Tony. You haven't seen the baby yet. He is just like Ike. He is such a darling. Isn't he a horror? Antonia. Sleep, baby. Sleep. Already, he is a musician. No. No, let me. Let me. - Hey. Hey. Congratulations, Tony. Here are some flowers. Florence, that is nice. Should you have so many people in the room? I like a lot. It keeps me cheerful. How sweet. What are you going to call her? Albert Sanger Birnbaum. Oh. I told him so. One half won't do it there, will it Ike? He should score for 3 or 4. I can score for forty halfs but where can I get them? The bassoons at the end of the scherzo quite overpower the strings. What? Sanger said that bassoons in a scherzo were like channel steamers in a fog. Tessa. Have you finished your exam paper? - Not yet. How much have you left? Arithmetic, scripture and English literature. Those papers have to go in tomorrow. I'm afraid you'll miss the concert tonight. Florence. This concert is a unique occasion. Well, it's her own fault. She wastes her time. Oh? She doesn't really mean it. But I do mean it. You're not in the Tyrol now remember. You're in England. Haven't I told you that Florence and I have almost agreed to part? Lewis. What nonsense. It is sound sense. And everybody sees it but you. Could I come to live with you and Jacob, Tony? Darling, we're going to Egypt right away. Tessa. You'd better get back to your books. Let's all give a hand. Come on, Tessa. How much do you know? Now, how many yards of paper would it take to paper a room twenty feet square? The answer comes out that it will take five million yards. Is that right? My good girl, you have papered it absolutely solid. What's this? Leave that alone. It's my diary. Tess, let me see it. I saw something about myself. Am I often mentioned? - Give it back to me at once. Lewis, aren't you dressed yet? - Just coming. What are you doing? I told you to finish your work. I have nearly finished. We shall be leaving at eight o'clock. Two trains approach one another at equal rates. Oh dear. Oh dear. Two trains approach one another at equal rates. Two trains. Equal rates. Equal rates. Equal rates. Equal rates. Equal rates. Florence, this tie. Oh, it's you, Tess. Come and tie it for me. There's a good girl. Do you remember that concert in Paris? Where we had to make a tie out of my hair ribbon. Where are the snows of yesteryear? Thank you. Now I'll give you back your diary. - Have you read it? You must try not to be so ungentlemanly. It's told me all I wanted to know. Come with me dearest, dearest Tessa. Don't let them make you cry. Come with me. Come with you? Where? - Anywhere. Brussels. Where I go after the concert. Florence would never allow it. Well. You'll have to come without leave. Well. There are points in it. Couldn't you let me have it in plain English? In plain English: I love you. You are too dear to leave behind. Love me? What do you mean by that? Why did you marry Florence? You know why. Yes. I know why. You loved me. It wasn't fair to both of us. That is why I've complained. It is done now. - And you want it undone. Why couldn't you have thought of all this before? You were so mad to get her. You forgot all about me. If you had .. Waited a bit. If I'd waited a bit. Tessa. Tessa, say it. I love you. Of course I do. I promised myself to you. Ever so long ago. When first I began to think about love. I knew I could not love any other man but you. And I don't think I ever will. But it's too late now. Everybody would say we've been carrying on behind poor Florence's back. I don't want to be a viper in anybody's bosom. I wish you would stop talking in that strain. It's a very good strain. A person must do what they think is right. What's the good? If you're unhappy. I don't believe we would escape unhappiness in one another's company. No. Nor do I. Nor do I. But I want your company. And 'want' must be your master. I've said my say. Lewis. Yes? If you feel you want a little holiday alone. I shall understand. It is generous for you to understand. Florence. I'm afraid you've had a pretty poor time of it with me. I have made mistakes perhaps. When I've gone, I wish you could be better friends with her. Tessa? - Yes. I don't think you quite understand how good she is. No. I don't quite understand. Lewis. This is a great moment of your life. You will keep harping on Tessa who doesn't really concern you at all. She does concern me enormously. I love her so. I want to be sure she'll be happy when I've gone away. What can I say? You're more fitted to love each other .. Than I am to have anything to do with either of you. Florence. If only I can be sure of this. I would go away and say: 'God bless you both'. Since when have you loved her so terribly? Always, I suppose. Why then, did you marry me? Because I was a fool. Does she know? Yes. She knows. You know too. Don't you? You may as well tell me everything. What exactly has there been between you? I told you. I love her. What do you mean by that? Is she your mistress? Florence. No. She is not. She won't have anything to do with me because of you. I don't believe you. - You're making a wicked mistake. I think it too contemptible. But I don't blame her. It's you I'll never forgive. Oh yes you would, my dear. You would forgive me anything. As often as I want. - I hate you. I loathe you. Women like you are fond of saying that. It means nothing. You have pretty ways. You go about the earth as if it belonged to you. But you would eat dirt to get the man you want. Go away. I hate you. Queen's Hall. Good luck, darling Lewis. Florence, you don't really mean I cannot go to the concert. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? - Ashamed? Yes. That I have to take you to task for your manners with my husband. I should take you to task for your manner to me. I won't have these things said. It's not my fault that I love Lewis. I did. Long before you came to the Tyrol. It's not a happy thing at all. But it's so much all of me. I couldn't want it to be different. Any more than I could want to be changed into another person. I understand that now he's your husband, I had better not see him anymore. That's why I've agreed to go away. You're going away because I intend to put a stop to this disgraceful intrigue. Intrigue? What's the matter with you, Florence? Don't look at me like that. I've done you no harm. - You betrayed me. Under my own roof. In my own house. Then let me get out of your house. - Whose house will you go to? Nobody wants you. You forced yourself into my house. And in my house you'll have to stay. Let me out! Let me out. Queen's Hall. [ Door knocks ] Roberto. Dear Roberto. She forgot to lock me in too. [ Radio concert music ] The stalls? Something cheap? Sorry. Not another seat in the house. You are too late. The concert has started. Alright. Try the gallery. Will it be long now? I shouldn't think so. It won't be long now, Bill. - Righto. Here. Have my chair. She ought to be in bed. Who are you waiting for? - Lewis Dodd. Oh? The conductor. Go Roberto. Don't miss the end. I will be alright. Please. Alright, mate. Lewis. - Tessa. Thank god that's over. Was it alright? - Magnificent. Sanger should have heard it. Shall we go? Goodbye, darling. Darling Roberto. Come. Hey. Tickets please. Tickets please. Tickets please. All tickets please. All tickets please. All tickets please. All tickets please. All tickets please. All tickets please. Here. Have a brandy. Turn up the gas, will you? And open the window. It's stuffy. Lewis. Well? - Nothing. What a funny room. I am a fool. We'll go away tomorrow. Dear heart, why? Are we the wandering Jews? Oh, it's a filthy place. It can't hurt us as long as we are together. All our rooms would have music on the floor. Boots on the mantelpiece. I've lived so long in an ideal home I had forgotten what this was like. We never can get it quite back. Life goes on. And little bits of us get lost. We shan't stay here a single night. We'll have our food and go. Go? Where? A convent can put you up for a night. A convent? Never. You won't take me out of this house alive. Don't think of it. Listen to reason. - We've run away. We've got to go on running away. We're not living our lives all over again to give you up a second time. You'll never understand until it's too late. I'm not too late now anyway. You are so blind, my love. You know, Florence says I am your fancy lady? Yes. If I'm not what she thinks. What am I? I've heard you say hard things of other women. Listen, beloved. I shall try to think. That every woman can be for some men .. What you have been for me. That sounds alright. It is getting quite dark. Never mind. Another sun will shine tomorrow. I'll sing a song. Another love will cheer thee. The sun will rise. A bright tomorrow .. Morn. I can't ever leave you. I won't, I won't. That's alright, darling. You shan't. Lewis, kiss me. Kiss me. Again. Again. As if it were never no more. Darling, darling. You are shivering. You really do look mouldy. Here. Come down to supper. I could not eat. I'm too tired. I'll tell them to bring you up some supper. It's very stuffy in here. Open the window then. I shan't be long. We'll have something to eat and go. Tessa. Darling. Tessa. Don't be so frightening. Tessa. Look at me. Speak to me. Light the light. It is lighted. I can't see. Lewis. I can't breathe. Yes. It's getting dark. Dear god. Help me. Another dance? Lewis. Tomorrow. ..r-o..
