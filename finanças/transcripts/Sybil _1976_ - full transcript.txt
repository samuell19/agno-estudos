**[voice humming] [telephone ringing] HELLO. ERNA. [sighing] LISTEN, I NEED YOUR SUPPORT. I, UH... SYBIL HAS DISSOCIATED INTO A BABY. I CAN'T GET HER BACK. A BABY. OH, I--I WAS TOO EAGER. I PUSHED HER OVER THE EDGE. WELL, I CAN'T GET HER HYPNOTIZED. I-- IF I COULD, I'D--I'D CONTACT VICKY, BUT SHE WON'T FOCUS ON--ON--ON--ON ANYTHING AND--AND SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD I SAY. SHE'S--SHE'S PREVERBAL. YEAH, BUT WHAT IF SHE STAYS LIKE THAT? NO. NO. NO HOSPITALS. NO, NOT WITH HER HISTORY. [sighing] COULD YOU? COULD YOU PLEASE, ERNA? I HATE TO DRAG YOU OUT ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS, BUT I--I... OH! HOLD ON A SECOND. DR. WILBUR, UH, I'M GETTING HER A SNACK. [exclaims] SWEETIE, HOW DO YOU FEEL? A LITTLE WOOZY. HUNGRY. WELL, THERE'S--THERE'S FOOD IN THE KITCHEN. GO GET SOME CHEESECAKE OR SOMETHING. I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE. OH, ERNA, IT'S OK. IT'S OK. [sighing] ONWARD AND UPWARD, SHE CAME TO AS SYBIL. (Dr. Wilbur) SYBIL DORSETT, PSYCHOANALYTIC SESSION 251. I'D HARDLY BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF ABOUT SYBIL'S MAKING HER SPONTANEOUS REENTRY OUT OF THE BABY, WHEN, SUDDENLY, WE'RE FACING THIS GHASTLY SEASON OF MIRTH. CHRISTMAS SEEMS TO BE A STRESSFUL TIME FOR SYBIL. THE OTHER PERSONALITIES HAVE BEEN STIRRED INTO A KIND OF FRENZIED WAKEFULNESS AND SOME WHO'VE BEEN DORMANT UNTIL NOW HAVE COME OUT. [bell ringing] ONE OF THEM, MARY, IS A DEVOUT, OLD-FASHIONED LITTLE HOMEMAKER WHO SEEMS ALMOST THE REINCARNATION OF SYBIL'S GRANDMOTHER. (as Mary) I WISH YOU ALL A HAPPY HOLIDAY. JOY IN THE NEW YEAR. NOBODY ANSWERS, VICKY. (as Vicky) MARY, THIS IS NEW YORK. THIS IS NOT WILLOW CORNERS. DON'T BE UPSET. LET ME CARRY THE PORTFOLIO FOR YOU. IT'S GETTING AWFULLY HEAVY. (as Mary) THANK YOU, DEAR. I CAN VAGUELY REMEMBER WHAT'S IN IT. EVERYTHING'S BEEN GETTING SO DIM LATELY. MUST BE SENILITY. [moaning] ANGELS. (as Vicky) THEY'RE ONLY DECORATIONS, MARY. GRANDMA'S WITH THE ANGELS. SO AM I. AM I GOING TO SEE GRANDMA, VICKY? NOT YET. WE'RE GOING TO SEE DR. WILBUR FIRST. COME AWAY, MARY, PLEASE. (as Mary) MARCIA PROMISED THAT SHE'D SEND ME TO GRANDMA SOON. WHY DOESN'T SHE DO IT? I'M GETTING SO TIRED OF WAITING. [knocking on door] (Dr. Wilbur) COME IN. OH, VICKY, COME ON IN. DR. WILBUR. PARDON ME FOR BARGING IN ON YOU LIKE THIS. I'M SORRY, BUT IT ALL SEEMS TO BE FALLING APART. I DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THINGS ANY LONGER. IT'S ALL RIGHT. TELL ME ABOUT IT. MARCIA IS CONSTANTLY THINKING OF SUICIDE. MARY THINKS SHE'S IN HEAVEN. AND SYBIL HAS INVITED RICHARD OVER FOR CHRISTMAS DINNER. NOW, I KNOW SHE ISN'T ABLE TO HANDLE IT. I KNOW THIS. IT'S ALL JUST AWFUL. WELL, WHAT MADE IT GO AWFUL? WHAT HAPPENED THIS TIME? HMM? IT'S CHRISTMAS. THE TREES AND THE WINDOWS AND EVERYBODY ALL COZY. EVERYBODY HAVING TO RUSH AROUND, HURRY BEFORE... BEFORE WHAT? WE'VE MADE YOU THIS. IT'S A CHRISTMAS CARD, FOR YOU. FOR OUR DR. WILBUR. THANK YOU. SORRY ABOUT THE COLOR. SYBIL TRIED FOR RED AND GREEN, BUT IT JUST KEPT GETTING PURPLE AND SHE WASN'T ABLE TO STOP IT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE DID? SHE TOOK THE CRAYON, AND SHE JUST SCRUBBED ON THE PAPER AND SCRUBBED ON IT LIKE THAT, AND SHE GRIT HER TEETH AND THEN SHE WADDED IT UP AND THREW IT IN THE TRASHCAN. WE RESCUED IT. WE--WE TRIED TO MAKE IT PRETTIER, YOU SEE. PEGGY ADDED THE RED, AND WE SMOOTHED IT OUT. WE--WE ALL TRIED. THANK YOU. WELL, SIT DOWN. I'VE BROUGHT YOU THESE, TOO. [horn blaring] BUT YOU MUSTN'T TELL HER. THEY'RE OUR PAINTINGS. WE DO THEM AT NIGHT. WE HIDE THEM ON A SECRET SHELF ON TOP OF THE CLOSET THAT MIKE MADE. WE WANT YOU TO HAVE THEM FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE WAY YOU SAY THAT VANESSA KEEPS THE MUSIC. BECAUSE SOMETHING AWFUL IS GOING TO HAPPEN. I CAN FEEL IT. IT'S GOING TO FALL APART, OR--OR BLOW UP, OR THERE'S GOING TO BE AN EARTHQUAKE. SWEETIE, THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE AN EARTHQUAKE. OR A TIDAL WAVE, OR--OR A GLACIER, OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT. JUST SOMETHING AWFUL IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THE END OF THE WORLD IS NOT WHAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF, VICKY. PLEASE KEEP THEM FOR SAFEKEEPING. PLEASE. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. VICKY, SAFEKEEPING FROM WHAT? HMM? NOW, WHAT IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN PURPLE AND CHRISTMAS AND THINGS BLOWING UP? HMM? WHAT DID MOTHER DO TO MAKE THE PURPLE? THERE ARE GUARDS AROUND THE PALACE. [sighing] VICKY, WE'VE GOT TO GET PAST THE GUARDS AROUND THE PALACE NOW. I MEAN, WE HAVE TO GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM WHERE EVERYBODY IS JOINED TOGETHER AND REMEMBERS EVERYTHING AND IT'S ALL RIGHT TO SAY IT. NOW, YOU KNOW THERE IS A WAY TO DO IT. WE'VE DISCUSSED THE WAY BEFORE. YES, I KNOW. HYPNOSIS. YES. SYBIL'S DADDY WOULDN'T LIKE IT. WELL, WHAT ABOUT SYBIL? IS SYBIL LISTENING NOW? SHE-- SHE'S SO AWFULLY AFRAID, DOCTOR. I THINK SHE WOULD ALMOST DO ANYTHING IF IT WOULD HELP MAKE US NOT BE SO AFRAID. GOOD. ALL RIGHT. COME ON. JUST LIE HERE, PUT YOUR FEET UP AND RELAX. IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO LOOK AT? NEHEMIAH, THE LITTLE HORSE THAT PEGGY MADE YOU. [chuckling] ALL RIGHT. HERE, COME ON, LIE BACK. PUT YOUR FEET UP. THAT'S RIGHT. NOW YOU JUST RELAX. RELAX. AND WHEN YOU'RE READY, YOU LOOK AT NEHEMIAH. HERE, YOU WILL LOOK AT NEHEMIAH. SYBIL'S HEART IS POUNDING SO. IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU WILL BE WITH ME, AND WE WILL TAKE THIS UP TOGETHER. YOU'LL BE SAFE. NOW JUST RELAX. LOOK AT NEHEMIAH. NOW, YOU'RE GOING TO SLEEP. DEEPLY, DEEPLY ASLEEP. ALL RIGHT? NOW, WE WILL COME CLOSE TO THE PURPLE. YOU WILL REMEMBER BUT YOU WON'T FEEL THE HURT. THE HURT IS IN THE PAST. NOW, WHEN DID THE PURPLE HAPPEN? 5 YEARS OLD. ANY PARTICULAR DAY? DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS, LIKE NOW. ALL RIGHT. NOW, WHEN I TOUCH YOUR LEFT SHOULDER, YOU WILL LISTEN WITH THE OTHERS WHILE I SPEAK WITH SYBIL. SYBIL. SYBIL. (as Sybil) YES. ARE WE GOING TO GRANDMA'S ROOM? IS THAT WHERE YOU WERE? I LIKE IT THERE. IT'S NICE IN GRANDMA'S ROOM. ALL RIGHT. WHEN I COUNT TO 5, YOU WILL BE IN GRANDMA'S ROOM. YOU COUNT WITH ME. 1. 2. 3. COUNT WITH ME. 4. 4. 5. 5. **[voice humming] (Dr. Wilbur) I'M RIGHT HERE, SYBIL. YOU CAN GO TO HER. [whimpering] WHAT IS IT, DEAR HEART? MY GRANDMA. YOU CAN GO TO HER. SHE'S DEAD. THIS IS A MEMORY, SWEETIE. [chair creaking] GUESS WHO'S HERE, GRANDMA? GIVE ME A HINT. SUGAR AND SPICE AND EVERYTHING NICE. IS THIS, BY ANY CHANCE, MY LITTLE DOWNSTAIRS NEIGHBOR? IS THIS MY SYBIL? YOU GUESSED RIGHT. (Sybil) GRANDMA. I LOVE MY GRANDMA. YOU CAN SAY IT TO HER IF YOU WANT TO, SWEETIE. I LOVE YOU, GRANDMA. LITTLE ROUND SCISSORS, I FOUND THEM. GOOD! HURRAY! (Dr. Wilbur) WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THE LITTLE SCISSORS? CUTTING. CUTTING WHAT? LITTLE PICTURE OF SANTA CLAUS. AND I STAY INSIDE THE LINES REAL GOOD. LIKE THIS. AND I MAKE A LITTLE STAR OUT OF TINFOIL. LIKE THIS. AND MY GRANDMA'S REAL NICE TO ME, AND SHE DOESN'T HOLLER AT ME, AND I DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID IN MY GRANDMA'S ROOM. NO. [gasping] IT'S ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE. YOU'RE STILL WITH YOUR GRANDMA. A BEAUTIFUL STAR. SEE HOW IT TWINKLES. I MAKE A GOOD SANTA, TOO? IT ALL RIGHT? OH, MY. YOU DIDN'T CUT A WHISKER. HE LOOKS SO HAPPY. I DON'T THINK HE LIKED BEING COOPED UP IN THAT OLD MAGAZINE. CAN I PASTE HIM ON MY STAR? THAT A GOOD IDEA? WONDERFUL. YOU SHOW ME. YOU CAN SHOW ME. THEN HE CAN TWINKLE WAY UP HIGH ON MY TREE WHERE HE WILL-- [object thudding] (Hattie) SYBIL! YOU COME DOWN HERE, YOUNG LADY! YOU'VE BEEN PESTERING THAT OLD WOMAN LONG ENOUGH! (Sybil) I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWNSTAIRS. YOU CAN FACE IT, SWEETIE. THERE'S TOO MUCH PURPLE. WE'RE GONNA GO DOWNSTAIRS TOGETHER AND YOU'RE GONNA REMEMBER THE PURPLE AND THIS IS THE WAY YOU'RE GONNA REMEMBER IT. (Sybil) MAYBE THERE'S NOTHING TO REMEMBER. (Dr. Wilbur) SWEETIE, YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE STAIRS, AND I'LL BE WITH YOU. CHOCOLATE. CHOCOLATE CHIPPIE. THAT'S RIGHT. COME ON. WATCH YOUR FEET. YOU KNOW HOW CLUMSY YOU ARE. COME ON. COME ON. HAVE A NICE TRIP. SEE YOU NEXT FALL. (Grandma) HATTIE, IS SYBIL ALL RIGHT? IT'S JUST ONE OF HER FALLS, GRANDMA! OH, GRANDMA, WHAT BIG EARS YOU HAVE. HERE.

"UNDER THE SPREADING CHESTNUT-TREE "THE VILLAGE SMITHY STANDS "THE SMITH, A MIGHTY MAN IS HE WITH LARGE AND SINEWY" SINEWY. MOMMA. "HIS HAIR IS CRISP" CRISP? I NEVER NOTICED THAT. ALL THESE YEARS, I NEVER NOTICED THAT. LETTUCE IS CRISP. "LETTUCE HEAD GO TO BED "YOUR NOSE IS RED YOUR NAME IS FRED I'LL KILL YOU DEAD" MOMMA. I'M BUSY. LOOK WHAT I MADE FOR THE CHRISTMAS TREE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN MADE? OH, THAT'S JUST A PICTURE OUT OF A MAGAZINE WITH A PIECE OF TINFOIL STUCK TO IT. GRANDMA SAYS IT'S PRETTY. I GO HANG IT ON THE CHRISTMAS TREE.

COME ON, REACH AROUND ME. I TOLD YOU NOT TO RUN IN THE HOUSE. [sobbing] [Hattie whacking] (Hattie) DON'T YOU CRY. DON'T YOU MAKE FACES. DON'T YOU GET MAD. MAD DOGS GET MAD, NOT PEOPLE. NOW, DON'T WORRY. I'M NOT GONNA HIT YOU THIS TIME. THIS TIME I'M ONLY GONNA KICK YOU. [moaning] YOU ARE SO ADORABLE WHEN YOU DO THAT. YOU LOOK JUST LIKE A LITTLE BABY CRAB. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? DRAW A PICTURE? UH-HUH. WHO FOR? MOMMA'S CHRISTMAS STOCKING. OH, WHAT A LOVELY THOUGHT. EVEN IF I DON'T LIKE MADE-UP THINGS AS MUCH AS FACTORY ONES. WHEN I'M A BIG GIRL, I GO WORK IN A FACTORY AND MAKE YOU SOMETHING REAL PRETTY. * OH, CHRISTMAS TREE * * OH, CHRISTMAS TREE * * HOW LOVELY ARE THY BRANCHES * COME ON, SING. [both singing] * NOT ONLY GREEN WHEN SUMMER GLOWS * * BUT IN THE WINTER WHEN IT SNOWS * [clearing throat] WELL, WHO EVER HEARD OF A GREEN CHICKEN WITH PURPLE FEET? CAN YOU PICTURE WHAT KIND OF EGGS THAT LAYS? SET A PLATTER OF THEM IN FRONT OF GRANDPA SOME FINE SABBATH MORNING, HE'D SURE TAKE THAT FOR A SIGN NOW, WOULDN'T HE? "ARMAGEDDON!" [laughing] (Sybil) * OH, CHRISTMAS TREE OH, CHRISTMAS TREE * * YOU ARE THE TREE MOST LOVED * * HOW OFT YOU'VE GIVEN ME DELIGHT * * WHEN CHRISTMAS FIRES * * ARE BURNING BRIGHT ** YOU THINK IT'S JUST SUNSHINE AND SINGING AND PRETTY COLORS WHEN YOU GROW UP?

HERE, YOU WANNA TEAR SOMETHING UP? COME ON, TEAR IT. THAT'S IT. I LOVED MY COLORS. OF COURSE YOU DID. MY COLORS ARE ME. THOSE ARE MY COLORS. SWEETIE, HASN'T IT EVER OCCURRED TO SYBIL THAT GOOD MOMMIES DON'T HURT THEIR GIRLS? MOMMIES PUT YOUR FINGERS IN THE MEAT GRINDER. NO, THEY DON'T. NOT GOOD ONES. MOMMIES ARE ONLY GOOD WHEN OTHER PEOPLE AROUND NOT WHEN THEY GET YOU ALONE. DR. WILBUR DOESN'T HURT YOU WHEN YOU'RE ALONE, DOES SHE? NO, DR. WILBUR THINKS THAT LITTLE GIRLS SHOULD BE HAPPY, ESPECIALLY LITTLE GIRLS WHO CAN PAINT GREEN CHICKENS WITH PURPLE FEET. MOMMA. WHAT'S THE MATTER, SWEETIE? [Sybil moaning] WHAT'S HAPPENING? MY WRISTS ARE GOING NUMB. CAN YOU TELL DR. WILBUR ABOUT IT? TELL ME ABOUT IT. [Sybil whimpering] [Sybil crying] WELL, TELL ME ABOUT IT. TELL ME. WHAT'S HAPPENING? TELL ME. WHAT'S HAPPENING, PEGGY? YOU BETTER SAY, "GOD IS LOVE," REAL QUICK. GOD IS LOVE. BECAUSE GOD HATES BAD GIRLS. AND IF THEY'RE REAL BAD, HE TAKES THEM BEFORE THEIR TIME. WHERE DOES GOD TAKE BAD LITTLE GIRLS, MOMMA? WHERE, MOMMA? [Hattie cackling] HE TAKES THEM WAY UP INTO THE DARK AND LEAVES THEM THERE. HE LETS THEM DROWN IN THE WHEAT. THEY CAN'T BREATHE AND THEY DIE. AND THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU. (Hattie) HAVE TO DO IT. UH-HUH. YES, MA'AM. HAVE TO. GOD IS LOVE. (Dr. Wilbur) WHO GOT YOU OUT, SYBIL? (Sybil) DADDY. MOMMA TOLD HIM THE LITTLE BOY DOWN THE STREET DID IT. WHAT DID DADDY SAY? DADDY SAID, "OH." DADDY ALWAYS BELIEVED MOMMA. YOU DIDN'T TELL DADDY THE TRUTH? NO, NOT SUPPOSED TO. MOMMA WOULD SEND ME TO GOD. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DRAWING WITH MY PURPLE CRAYON. WHY? SO SOMEONE WILL KNOW I WAS HERE. SWEETIE, THAT BAD END-OF-THE-WORLD FEELING IS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. IT'S JUST THE COMING OF YOUR OWN ANGER AND THE COLOR OF THAT ANGER IS PURPLE. I DON'T WANT IT. I'M AFRAID OF IT. I KNOW, BUT AVOIDING IT IS JUST WHAT'S GETTING IN THE WAY OF YOUR DOING ANYTHING. DON'T YOU BE MAD AT MOMMA, OR SHE'LL GET YOU. NO, SWEETIE. SHE WON'T GET ME. I'M STRONGER THAN SHE IS. AND I'LL GET JUST AS MAD AT MOMMA AS I LIKE AND I'LL STAY MAD AT HER FOR YOU UNTIL YOU ARE ABLE TO DO IT FOR YOURSELF. [sighing] ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA LEAVE WILLOW CORNERS NOW. I DON'T EVER WANNA GO BACK THERE AGAIN. WE'RE COMING BACK INTO THE PRESENT. YOU'RE 6, 14, 21, 29. THIS IS TOO FAST. IT'S ALL RIGHT TO COME INTO THE PRESENT, SWEETIE, BECAUSE I'M IN THE PRESENT. YOUR MOTHER IS DEAD AND BURIED IN A GRAVE IN KANSAS CITY. MOTHER'S DEAD? SHE'S DEAD. IT'S ALL RIGHT. NOW YOU'LL ONLY REMEMBER WHAT IT'S SAFE TO REMEMBER. [Dr. Wilbur exhaling] (Sybil) I'M SO ANXIOUS. (Dr. Wilbur) SWEETIE, YOU'VE SURVIVED. THAT YOU'VE FOUND SUCH A CREATIVE ALTERNATIVE TO INSANITY IS MIRACULOUS AND IT--IT WILL PROTECT YOU TILL YOU DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE. BUT WHAT IF I CAN'T COOK DINNER FOR RICHARD? (Sybil) I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT BEING EMBARRASSED. (Dr. Wilbur) YOU'RE PROTECTED, SWEETIE. VICKY WOULDN'T LET YOU BE EMBARRASSED. SHE'LL CALL ON ONE OF THE OTHERS. VANESSA'S MORE COMFORTABLE WITH RICHARD THAN YOU ARE. I ENVY HER SO. AND NOW I'M GONNA SUGGEST THAT WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, AND IT'S CHRISTMAS, YOU WILL HAVE A BEAUTIFUL DAY. A DAY THAT'S ALL YOURS, THAT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE WITH. PAINT PRETTY PLACE CARDS FOR RICHARD AND MATTHEW AND PUT RED CANDLES ON THE TABLE. OH, IT'LL--IT'LL BE SO NICE. HANDS, PLEASE. [chuckling] CAN WE REACH? YEAH, I GUESS. [chuckling] (Richard) OK, LADIES FIRST. UM, I WISH... WELL, MY WISH IS TAKEN CARE OF BECAUSE YOU'RE BOTH HERE AND THAT'S MY WISH. I WISH FOR A RED DUMP TRUCK. [chuckling] LOVE, JOY, AND PEACE TO US ALL. WHEN IN DOUBT, EAT. SO LET'S BEGIN. I USED TO HATE CHRISTMAS AT HOME. ALL THOSE AUNTS AND UNCLES SPRAWLING AROUND, TOO FULL TO MOVE WINDING THEIR WATCHES AND SAYING, "DON'T YOU THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME WE GOT THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD?" [chuckling] I THINK I'LL SEE ABOUT THE CHICKEN. STAY, PLEASE. IT WON'T RUN AWAY. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IT'S NICE TO BE QUIET FOR A CHANGE. [sighing] I--I FEEL ALL OUT HERE SOME PLACE. I FEEL LIKE I'M FLOATING AROUND OUTSIDE MYSELF. I THINK I'D FEEL CLOSER IF WE TALKED LONG DISTANCE. WE HAVE TIME. WE'LL GET THERE. (Matthew) WHERE ARE WE GOING, DADDY? NOT THAT KIND OF GETTING THERE, MATTHEW. ANYBODY INTERESTED IN A DRUMSTICK? ME, PLEASE. HELLO? HELLO? THIS IS LONG DISTANCE. THIS IS LONG DISTANCE CALLING MISS SYBIL DORSETT. HELLO. HIYA, SLATS.

YEAH, WELL, UH, YOU GOTTA GIVE ME AN ANSWER QUICK. I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE DISAPPOINTED, LEFTY. I GOT NO EXPECTATIONS, SLATS. **[voice humming] [knocking on door] (Sybil as Vanessa) BE RIGHT THERE. OH, VANESSA, YOU LOOK JUST FINE. YOU KNOW, A KEY WOULDN'T DO MUCH GOOD AGAINST ALL THIS. YOU NEED A SCALING LADDER. (as Vanessa) I GUESS IT'S CALLED SECURITY. OPEN YOUR CHRISTMAS PRESENT. OH, RICHARD. [mimicking] "OH, RICHARD." I THOUGHT WE AGREED WE WEREN'T GONNA DO THIS. I'M A CONGENITAL LIAR. OH! REMIND ME NEVER TO LET YOU TAKE OFF A BANDAGE. WELL, IF I'M VERY CAREFUL AND DON'T TEAR IT, THEN I CAN DRAW ON THE BACK OF IT. YOU DRAW ON THE WHOLE THING. IT'S ONLY WATERCOLOR PAPER. OH, RICHARD. IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PAPER. THANK YOU. I WANT-- I WANT YOU-- YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING. THE NIGHTGOWN SAYS IT ALL. YOU WANT CLOSENESS, THAT'S ALL. I--I NEVER EXACTLY HAD CLOSENESS. LOVE, I TOLD YOU ONE TIME, YOU'RE ONLY 12 YEARS OLD.

[meowing] I ASK YOU HOW IT FEELS TO HAVE RICHARD MOVE AND YOU TELL ME YOUR KITTY BOTHERS YOU. THAT'S INTERESTING. LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT. IT'LL JUST OPEN UP A WHOLE CAN OF PEAS. NO, WHAT IT MIGHT OPEN UP IS A WHOLE NEST OF KITTENS, WHICH IS SOMETHING WE'VE AVOIDED EVERY TIME YOU'VE DREAMED ABOUT THEM. NOW, MAYBE THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN YOUR ANGER AT RICHARD MOVING AND YOUR-- THERE ISN'T ANY ANGER. SWEETIE, YOUR ANGER AT THE HEADLESS CAT. CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT, SO DON'T WONDER. [sighing] CURIOSITY DIDN'T TEAR ITS HEAD OFF. NOW, WHO DID THAT? YOU WANTED TO GET RID OF MOMMA, RIGHT? THAT'S ONE THEORY. THERE ARE A MILLION THEORIES. YOU PICK ONE. I'LL AGREE TO ANYTHING. I SEE. YOU ALWAYS SAY, "I SEE." YOU KNOW, MARCIA WAS SO AFRAID OF WANTING TO KILL MOMMA THAT SHE ALMOST KILLED HERSELF FOR JUST HAVING THE THOUGHT. I DON'T KNOW MARCIA. I'M NOT INTERESTED. MARCIA TOLD ME ABOUT A MEMORY SHE HAD ABOUT A LITTLE BOX. WHY DO I HAVE TO REMEMBER SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME? WHY CAN'T I BLANK OUT? BECAUSE YOU CAN STAND SOME OF THOSE FEELINGS NOW, SWEETIE. YOU'RE GETTING STRONGER. NOW, CAN'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE LITTLE BOX? IT STARTED TO GROW. IT GOT BIGGER. THAT'S RIGHT. AND IT GREW BIGGER UNTIL IT WAS BIG ENOUGH TO PUT MOMMA IN. IN FACT, IT TURNED INTO A COFFIN, DIDN'T IT? I DID NOT WANNA GET RID OF MOMMA. I WANTED TO GET RID OF THE HURT. I WANTED THE HURT TO GO AWAY, NOT MOMMA. I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BAD. SWEETIE, IT'S NOT BAD TO WANNA GET RID OF SOMETHING THAT HURTS. AND MOMMA WAS JUST ONE BIG HURT WITH A NAME ATTACHED TO IT. IT WAS STILL MY MOMMA. THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT OF NATURE. SYBIL, A WISH CAN'T KILL PEOPLE. NOW, IF THE WORLD HAS TO TURN PURPLE AND LITTLE CHILDREN HAVE TO KILL THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY WISH THEIR MOTHERS WERE DEAD, THERE WOULDN'T BE ANYBODY LEFT ON EARTH. SYBIL, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME. YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE AGAIN, AREN'T YOU? WHY DO YOU WANNA KILL YOURSELF INSTEAD OF DOING WHAT WE HAVE TO DO? WHY DO YOU WANNA KILL THIS WONDERFULLY CREATIVE ORGANISM BEFORE YOU'VE EVEN BEGUN TO LIVE? I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU'RE ANGRY. I'M NOT ANGRY. I'M DEFINITE. YOU INSULT ME, MY DEAR. YOU INSULT MY HEART. WELL, JUST LOOK AT ME. CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT I AM? I HAVE LOOKED AT YOU AND LOOKED AT YOU FOR MONTH AFTER MONTH AFTER MONTH AND I HAVE SEEN YOU. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING. AND I WASN'T THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE. I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT A CHARADE THIS IS. DR. WILBUR, I CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS. YOU BETTER SIT DOWN. I HAVE A BIG SHOCK FOR YOU. IT'S A LIE. THE WHOLE THING. I DON'T HAVE MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES. NOT EVEN ONE. IT'S JUST ME. I--I DON'T-- I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I GOT STARTED. ALL THE THINGS I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY MOTHER, THEY'RE ALL LIES, EVERY ONE OF THEM. SHE SPOILED ME ROTTEN, WATCHED ME EVERY SINGLE SECOND. YOU KNOW, IT INTERESTS ME, SYBIL THAT THE DENIAL COMES AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME. THIS IS NOT A DENIAL. EXCUSE ME, SWEETIE, BUT IT COMES ON THE EVE OF MY CHICAGO LECTURES WHICH MUST SEEM LIKE SOME KIND OF ABANDONMENT TO YOU THE WAY RICHARD ABANDONED YOU. NO, IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT. AND 2, WE ARE AT A PLACE WHERE THE MOST TERRIFYING MEMORIES OF ALL ARE JUST BELOW THE SURFACE. DR. WILBUR, EXCUSE ME, BUT THIS SIMPLY IS NOT DENIAL OR RESISTANCE OR ANY OF THOSE PATIENT TRICKS. IT IS AN ADMISSION OF CULPABILITY. I'M SORRY. I KNOW I OWE YOU A FORTUNE, AND YOU'LL BE PAID. BUT TO GO ON LIKE THIS WOULD BE VERY CRUEL. YOU'RE TOO GOOD A PERSON FOR THAT. SO I THINK WHAT I SHOULD DO IS TAKE MY FATHER UP ON HIS OFFER AND STAY IN THAT SUNNY LITTLE ROOM WHERE ALL MY THINGS WILL FIT JUST PERFECT AS THE FAMOUS FRIEDA SAYS. ARE YOU SYBIL? OF COURSE I'M SYBIL. WHO ELSE WOULD I BE? WHAT HAPPENED IN THE GREEN KITCHEN? THAT'S MY CUE TO TURN INTO PEGGY, RIGHT? DR. WILBUR, THERE IS NO PEGGY TO TURN INTO. DO YOU MIND IF I TEST THAT? HYPNOSIS? BE MY GUEST. ALL RIGHT, WOULD YOU LIE DOWN ON THE SOFA? SUR LE COUCH? ONLY VICKY'S SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT, RIGHT? [mimics Dr. Wilbur] "NOW, DEAR HEART, "I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT NEHEMIAH. "YOU WILL LOOK AT NEHEMIAH, SWEETIE, AND I WILL ASK TO SPEAK TO THE OTHERS." I'VE REALLY GOTTEN IT DOWN, HAVEN'T I, DOCTOR? (Dr. Wilbur) IN MY CHICAGO HOTEL ROOM, I STARTED TO THINK THAT SYBIL'S DENIAL MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN HER FIRST BREAKTHROUGH. MAYBE THE SELVES HAD BANDED TOGETHER TO STOP ME FROM TAKING SYBIL DOWN TO THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACE OF ALL. HELLO. YEAH, I'D LIKE ANOTHER CHICAGO NUMBER, PLEASE. WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT I'LL JUST HAVE TO KEEP ON ASKING UNTIL SOMEBODY PUTS A PHONE BOOK IN HERE. I'VE GOT 2 BIBLES AND NO PHONE BOOK. [laughing] THE PERSON I'M LOOKING FOR ISN'T IN THE BIBLE. A DORSETT, WILLARD DORSETT. (Dr. Wilbur) YOU UNDERSTAND, MR. DORSETT, I JUST WANNA TIE UP SOME LOOSE ENDS, SO TO SPEAK. SO YOU CAME TO THE HORSE'S MOUTH. IS THAT IT? IT SEEMED THE SENSIBLE THING TO DO. I, UH... I DO RECALL A BRUISE OR 2 FROM TIME TO TIME. I SEE. WELL, TELL ME, DO YOU RECALL A BROKEN LARYNX? WELL, NOW YOU SAY IT, IT SEEMS I DO. RAN INTO A CLOTHESLINE, I BELIEVE. OH, WHO SAID THAT? MY WIFE, I SUPPOSE. SHE DRIED THE WASH OUT BACK. NOW, BY WASH, YOU MEAN, UH, THINGS LIKE--LIKE SHEETS AND TOWELS AND THINGS LIKE THAT? SURE. SOMETHING... SO YOU'D HAVE TO HANG THEM UP PRETTY HIGH IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM OFF THE GROUND. HMM? IS THAT RIGHT? THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH. WELL, IT SEEMS TO ME IT WOULD TAKE AN AWFUL LOT OF DETERMINATION FOR A LITTLE 4-YEAR-OLD TO GET HER THROAT UP, YOU KNOW, HIGH ENOUGH TO BREAK HER LARYNX. WOULDN'T YOU SAY? WHEN YOU STOP TO THINK ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, MR. DORSETT, I HAVE HERE A CATALOG OF HURTS. AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO STOP AND THINK ABOUT IS, UH, HOW MRS. DORSETT EXPLAINED THE REST OF THESE. OR PERHAPS EVEN IF, UH... DID YOU EVER ASK SYBIL? UH, SOMETIME WHEN YOU WERE ALONE TOGETHER WITH HER AND SHE MAYBE FELT A LITTLE FREER TO CONFIDE? DID YOU? I DON'T GET THE DRIFT OF THIS CONVERSATION. WELL, I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU. I... WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW IS DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOUR WIFE INFLICTED THESE INJURIES HERSELF? ABSOLUTELY NOT. YOU UNDERSTAND, WHAT I MEAN IS, DO YOU THINK THERE WAS ANYTHING IN HER PERSONALITY, IN HER CHARACTER-- ABSOLUTELY NOT. THAT WAS A FINE WOMAN. I'M SURE SHE WAS A FINE WOMAN, BUT EVEN THE FINEST PEOPLE CAN GET VERY SICK, MR. DORSETT AND WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE IS SICKNESS. NOW, WAS SHE EVER SICK? UH, EMOTIONALLY SICK, I MEAN, NOT-- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. I LIVE IN THE SAME CENTURY YOU DO. I BEG YOUR PARDON. I'M SORRY. SHE WAS NERVOUS. NOT SICK, JUST NERVOUS. SHE JUST TALKED SO MUCH, THAT'S ALL. SHE'D TELL POEMS OUT LOUD, AND GET UP AND DANCE IN RESTAURANTS, THINGS LIKE THAT. JUST TOO BIG A HEAD OF STEAM, THAT'S ALL. FRUSTRATED WITH THE SMALL-TOWN LIFE OR ME OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW. SHE'D GET REAL LOW SOMETIMES. "LOW DOWN AND BLUE," SHE'D CALL IT. ONE YEAR, SHE JUST SAT QUIET THAT WHOLE WINTER. WOULDN'T EVEN FEED HERSELF. GOT SO BAD I DROVE HER UP TO THE STATE HOSPITAL. WELL, THEN WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT DID THEY SAY? OH, THEY SAID SHE HAD THE PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA. WELL, MR. DORSETT, THAT'S... THAT'S VERY SICK. IT'S--IT'S... IT'S CERTAINLY TOO SICK TO BE RAISING A LITTLE GIRL. THEY--THEY WERE WRONG, YOU SEE. WELL, HATTIE TOLD ME HERSELF A-AFTER I GOT HER HOME THAT ALL THAT DOCTOR DID WAS SIT AND STARE AT HER THE WHOLE TIME SHE WAS WITH HIM. SAID IF ANYONE WAS GONNA TELL HER SHE WAS A LOONY, HE BETTER GET SOMEONE TO DO IT BESIDE ONE OF THE LOONS. WELL, YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH THE LOGIC OF THAT, NOW CAN YOU? YOU CALL THAT SICK? [birds chirping] [dog barking] EXCUSE ME. COULD YOU TELL ME IF DR. QUINONESS STILL IS, UH, LIVING IN WILLOW CORNERS, IN TOWN? YOU BET. STRAIGHT ON INTO TOWN. CORNER OF 4TH AND MAPLE. 4TH AND MAPLE? THANK YOU. YEAH. (Dr. Quinoness) I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND CARRYING THE OATMEAL COOKIES BUT JULIA GETS POOPED ON THESE STAIRS NOW. OLD PLACES ARE BUILT FOR GOATS ANYWAY. WELL, I APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING TIME OUT TO SEE ME, DR. QUINONESS. NOT TAKING TIME OUT FROM MUCH. [laughing] WELL, HERE WE BE. THE MUSEUM. USED TO BE THE ONLY SURGERY FOR 40 MILES TILL THEY BUILT THE HOSPITAL OUT ON ROUTE 9. I USE IT NOW MAINLY BECAUSE THE SUN LASTS LONGER THAN ANY OTHER ROOM IN THE HOUSE. LATELY, I'VE BECOME GREEDY ABOUT SUNLIGHT. PLEASE SIT. THANK YOU. YES, I SEEM TO REMEMBER HEARING THAT SYBIL WAS IN NEW YORK CITY. OF COURSE, NOWADAYS, WITH ALL THE FAMILY EITHER DEAD OR MOVED AWAY, DON'T KEEP TABS LIKE I USED TO. THANK YOU. SHE, UH, HAS A NERVOUS CONDITION, HAS SHE? MMM-HMM. YES. AH, LITTLE SYBIL. LITTLE SPARROW OF A THING. NOT SURPRISED IT'S COME TO THAT. YOU KNOW, SHE HAD A NERVOUS MOTHER. SO I UNDERSTAND. HATTIE. PILLAR OF THE TOWN. DID EVERYTHING. WELL, I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF I COULD SEE SYBIL'S RECORDS, DOCTOR. WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT LIGHT THAT WOULD SHED. YOU SEE, I--I NEVER, NEVER TREATED HER FOR NERVES ONLY FOR THE USUAL CHILDHOOD ACHES AND PAINS. I UNDERSTAND, BUT I--I WOULD CONSIDER IT A GREAT COURTESY. I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE ANYTHING. LET ME SEE. DORSETTS. DORSETTS. OH, YES. HERE WE ARE. SYBIL. TONSILLECTOMY. I REMEMBER THAT. SHE FOUGHT SO HARD WE COULD HARDLY GET THEM OUT. TORN LIGAMENTS, RIGHT SHOULDER. FRACTURED CLAVICLE. PALM OF RIGHT HAND BURNED ON STOVE. FRACTURED LARYNX. BEANS STUCK UP HER NOSE. GAS INHALATION. USUAL CHILDHOOD ACHES AND PAINS, HUH? DID YOU EVER SPECULATE? YOU KNOW, YOU CAN LIVE TOO LONG, DOCTOR. I NEVER TOLD ANYONE THIS. SYBIL CAME TO ME WITH A BLADDER COMPLAINT. VERY UNUSUAL IN A LITTLE GIRL. COULDN'T PASS HER WATER. I HAD TO CATHETERIZE HER. IF YOU DID A GYNECOLOGICAL ON HER RIGHT NOW, I'D WAGER YOU'D SEE WHAT I SAW. SCARIFICATION OF THE INNER WALL, DESTRUCTION OF CERTAIN TISSUES. I DON'T BELIEVE SHE CAN EVER BECOME A MOTHER. YOU KNOW, THE GOOD LORD SHIPS US INTO THIS WORLD NOT A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT BETTER THAN THE U.S. MAILS. BUT THE HAND OF THE ALMIGHTY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT I FOUND INSIDE THAT CHILD. YOU'VE BEEN VERY GENEROUS, DOCTOR. YOU WANNA GIVE ME A TIP, DOCTOR? IF I CAN. IN YOUR... IN YOUR TRADE, YOU HEAR A LOT OF CONFESSIONS. DR. QUINONESS, IT WAS A LONG, LONG TIME AGO. HOW DO I FIND ABSOLUTION? [birds chirping] [dog barking] [door squeaking] **[voice humming] [water dripping] [gasping] [water continues dripping] [dog barking] **[voice humming] (Dr. Wilbur) IT HAPPENED, SWEETIE. THOSE ARE THE CRAYON SCRATCHES YOU MADE WHEN MOMMA PUT YOU IN THE WHEAT BIN. THEY WERE YOUR CRY FOR HELP. YOUR PURPLE ANGER. IT DOESN'T SEEM REAL. WELL, IT HAPPENED. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WENT TO ALL THIS TROUBLE AFTER I... I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE MEAN TO YOU. OH, I KNOW THAT. IT'S JUST I WAS AFRAID. NOT OF WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT SO MUCH. CAN YOU TELL ME NOW? I WAS AFRAID OF THE HOPE. THE HOPE? THE HOPE THAT I MIGHT GET WELL. YOU BEGAN TO MAKE ME BELIEVE I COULD, ALMOST. FOR A WHILE, I COULD SEE MYSELF PAINTING, OR PLAYING THE PIANO OR... YES? BEING WITH PEOPLE. THEN I REALIZE THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT HOPE CAN EVER BE REAL IS YOU. AND IF YOU'RE THE ONLY HOPE, AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY, AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK, THEN I'M A GONER. I JUST... I HAVE TO BE WITH PEOPLE, DR. WILBUR. I KNOW THAT. I'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN LET IN MOST PLACES. WELL, RICHARD LET ME IN FOR A WHILE AND YOU LET ME IN A LITTLE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO. BUT THEN, WHEN HE LEFT AND YOU WERE GONE I REALIZED THAT THERE WASN'T A HOUSE IN ALL OF NEW YORK THAT I COULD GO IN. QUITE HONESTLY, [sighing] I... I HAILED A CAB A COUPLE OF TIMES. I THOUGHT I'D MAKE UP FOR IT SOMEHOW. I'D EAT LESS OR SOMETHING. BECAUSE I HAD TO TALK TO SOMEBODY. AND ONE CAB DRIVER TALKED TO ME. HE WAS VERY INTERESTING. WE DROVE AROUND FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. YES? AND HE DROVE ME BY HERE. AND I LOOKED UP IN YOUR APARTMENT TO SEE IF THERE WAS A LIGHT ON. I KNOW THAT WAS WRONG. WHY? I DON'T KNOW. IT SEEMED LIKE AN INVASION OF YOUR PRIVACY SOMEHOW. WITH A LOOK? I KNOW IT'S SILLY. NO, IT ONLY MEANS THERE WAS A WISH THAT WENT ALONG WITH THE LOOK THAT YOU THINK IT WAS WRONG TO HAVE. MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE HAD A WISH JUST FOR A SECOND. WOULD YOU LOOK THE OTHER WAY, PLEASE? SWEETIE, IT HELPS ME IF I CAN SEE YOU. THEN I'LL LOOK THE OTHER WAY. IT HAS TO DO WITH A DREAM. IT HAS TO DO WITH YOU. MMM-HMM. YOU AND THIS LITTLE GIRL. THIS FUNNY LITTLE GIRL WITH A SCRUNCHED-UP FACE. AND SHE'S VERY YOUNG, SO WHAT SHE FEELS IS... WELL, MAYBE IT'S EXCUSABLE. WHAT DOES SHE FEEL? SHE'S TOO YOUNG TO REALIZE THAT YOU'RE A DOCTOR, NOT HER FRIEND. GO ON. WELL SHE WANTS TO SIT BESIDE YOU IN YOUR BIG CHAIR. AND SHE ASKS. AND SHE DOES. BUT SHE'S JUST A LITTLE GIRL, UNDERSTAND, AND IT'S JUST A DREAM. WHAT WORRIES YOU ABOUT HER? I'M AFRAID TO TELL YOU. THAT YOU FEEL SATISFACTION IN THE DREAM? IT'S NOT A DREAM, SYBIL. EVERY TIME YOU COME HERE AS PEGGY, YOU SIT HERE IN THIS CHAIR BESIDE ME AND YOU PUT MY ARM AROUND YOU, AND YOU REST YOUR HEAD ON MY SHOULDER AND YOU FEEL SATISFACTION. OH, I COULDN'T. I KNOW YOU COULDN'T, BUT PEGGY CAN. AND YOU ALLOW IT? OF COURSE I ALLOW IT. SOMETIMES BEING CLOSE IS THE ONLY NOURISHMENT THAT COUNTS. IT SEEMS LIKE TOO MUCH TO DO FOR HER. WELL... DON'T YOU THINK I MIGHT BE DOING IT FOR MYSELF ALSO? DON'T YOU THINK, UH, I MIGHT DO IT BECAUSE I ENJOY BEING ALLOWED TO EXPRESS MY AFFECTION FOR YOU? YOU MEAN FOR HER. NO, FOR YOU. FOR SYBIL, FOR THE TOTALITY OF YOU. DON'T YOU KNOW THAT? I LOVE YOUR COURAGE. I LOVE YOUR HUMOR. I LOVE YOUR TALENT. I LOVE YOUR TENDERNESS WITH OTHER PEOPLE. I LOVE YOUR QUICKNESS. I LOVE YOUR COMPANY. I LOVE YOU. NOW THE ONLY THING THAT'S HOLDING YOU ON THAT CHAIR IS THE LAW OF GRAVITY. SYBIL, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE WET THINGS ARE ON YOUR FACE? OH. THOSE ARE SYBIL'S FIRST TEARS. [laughing] THE FIRST ONES YOU'VE HAD SINCE GRANDMA DIED. I LOVED MY GRANDMOTHER. I KNOW YOU DID. I LOVE YOU, TOO. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO TELL YOU A TRUE STORY? WELL, ONCE, A LONG TIME AGO, WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL IN MONTANA, I WAS LYING OUT ON THE GRASS ONE DAY JUST LOOKING AT THE ANTS. [both laughing] AND THE GRASS WAS SWEET AND DEEP AND SOFT, AND THE SUN WAS WARM ON MY BACK, AND THE INSECTS WERE BUZZING AND IT WAS... EVERYTHING WAS DROWSY. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, I SAW ONE ANT WHO WAS STRUGGLING TO PICK UP THIS GRAIN OF SAND [laughing] THAT WAS FAR TOO HEAVY FOR IT TO LIFT. AND HE STRUGGLED AND HE STRUGGLED. AND PRETTY SOON, ANOTHER ANT CAME BY AND TOGETHER, THE 2 OF THEM LIFTED THE GRAIN OF SAND AND STARTED TO CARRY IT AWAY. [laughing] WELL, I GOT SO EXCITED THAT I HOLLERED TO MY MOMMA, AND SHE RAN OUT AND SHE FLOPPED DOWN IN THE GRASS BESIDE ME AND SHE SAID "NOW, ISN'T THAT MIRACULOUS "HOW MUCH 2 CREATURES CAN ACCOMPLISH TOGETHER WHEN THEY CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER." AND YOUR MOTHER WAS BESIDE YOU? MMM-HMM. IN THE GRASS. WATCHING ANTS? ON A SUMMER'S DAY. HELPING EACH OTHER. (Sybil) IT'S TOO GREEN. WHY DID GOD HAVE TO MAKE EVERYTHING GREEN? GREEN TREES, GREEN GRASS. (Dr. Wilbur) GREEN KITCHENS. I'M NOT EVEN GONNA LOOK AT THE GREEN. I'M JUST GONNA LOOK AT THE BLOSSOMS. SWEETIE, I KNOW THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT HURDLE OF ALL, BUT WE'VE GOTTA GET INTO THAT KITCHEN NOW AND FACE WHAT WENT ON THERE. I'M TOO SCARED OF THAT. YOU'RE JUST SCARED OF BEING SCARED. YOU SURVIVED IT WHEN IT HAPPENED, AND YOU'LL SURVIVE REMEMBERING IT. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH RELIEF YOU FELT WHEN WE FACED THE OTHER THINGS, THE HANDS, THE--THE PEOPLE, AND CHRISTMAS? SO WE WILL FACE THIS, TOO, FINALLY, AND--AND--AND LEAVE IT BEHIND FOREVER. LEAVE ALL THAT PAIN BEHIND. AND WE'LL FIND A NICE QUIET PLACE FOR A PICNIC, AND WE'VE GOT ALL YOUR PAINTING THINGS, AND WE'RE JUST GONNA LET IT HAPPEN, OK? OK. DID WE BRING NEHEMIAH IN CASE WE NEED HIS HELP? MMM-HMM. HE'S WITH US. [birds chirping] [ducks quacking] WHAT IS IT, SWEETIE? WHAT'S IN THE WAY? I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T SEE IT. I CAN FEEL IT. IT'S FEAR. PEGGY'S PETRIFIED RIGHT NOW. (Sybil) THIS IS THE FIRST STROKE I'VE DARED TO PAINT. [panting] OH, DR. WILBUR. (Dr. Wilbur) WHAT? [panting] THIS IS COMING. JUST ALLOW IT, SWEETIE. JUST ALLOW IT. OH, IT'S LIKE WAVES, WAVES THROUGH ME. IT'S AWFUL. (Dr. Wilbur) ALLOW IT. GO WITH IT. (Sybil) OH, NO, NO. GO WITH IT. JUST ALLOW IT, SWEETIE. OH, IS THIS PEGGY? IT'S ONLY A HINT OF WHAT SHE FEELS, SWEETIE. SHE FEELS MUCH MORE THAN THAT. OH, IT'S THE WORST FEELING. OH, IT'S SO AWFUL. JUST GO WITH IT. TRY TO GO WITH IT. STAY WITH IT AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH. CAN YOU REMEMBER? WHAT'S UNDERNEATH IT, SWEETIE? I'M SCARED. [panting] I'M SCARED. [sobbing] NO. WHAT IS IT? WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? IT'S ALL GREEN. AND THE PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE. PEGGY, WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU IN THE KITCHEN? [panting] [water dripping] [clearing throat] HAVE TO DO IT. (Sybil) IT'S DRIPPING. IT'S DRIPPING. YOU CAN HEAR IT DRIPPING. (Dr. Wilbur) I KNOW. THERE'S EVEN A RUST SPOT UNDER THE TAP. HAVE TO DO IT. [Sybil wailing] WHAT DOES MOMMA HAVE TO DO? EVERY MORNING. EVERY MORNING, AFTER I EAT MY PRUNES AND EVERYBODY'S GONE, SHE PULLS DOWN THE SHADES. SHE PULLS DOWN THE SHADES SO NOBODY WILL SEE. AND SHE'S GOT ME TIED UP ON THE TABLE. OH, IT'S SO COLD. THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S METAL, SWEETIE. AND THE WATER, THE WATER'S RUNNING. THE WATER'S RUNNING. IT HAS TO RUN A LONG TIME TILL IT'S COLD ENOUGH. WHAT DOES SHE NEED COLD WATER FOR? SHE GIVES ME AN ENEMA. [Sybil sobbing] IT SMELLS ALL DISINFECTANNY. OH, MY GOD. [Sybil panting] AND MY FEET, MY FEET ARE TIED TO THE BROOM HANDLE. WHY? THEY'RE TIED TO THE BROOM HANDLE. WHY? SO SHE CAN PULL ME UP AND PULL ME UP AND TIE ME TO THE LIGHT. TO THE LIGHT. TO THE LIGHT. SHE'S GONNA BRING IT. OH, NO. NO, PLEASE. PLEASE, IT'LL TEAR ME. IT'LL TEAR ME. OH, GET IT AWAY. WHAT WILL TEAR? WHAT'S SHE BRINGING, SWEETIE? [Sybil panting] WHAT'S SHE BRINGING? [Sybil sobbing] WHAT IS IT? WHAT WILL TEAR? WHAT IS SHE BRINGING? WHAT IS SHE BRINGING? THE KNIFE AND THE BUTTONHOOK. THE KNIVES. I CAN SEE THEM. I CAN SEE THEM. OH, PLEASE. IT'S ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE. IT'S ALL RIGHT. ONCE WE'RE THROUGH THIS, YOU'LL BE AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERYTHING GOOD. BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET THROUGH THIS. IT'S ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE. IT'S ALL RIGHT. OH, OH. OH, DEAR LORD. OH, DEAR LORD. OH, DEAR LORD. WHEN I GROW UP, I WILL HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF CHILDREN AND I WILL BE GOOD TO THEM. GO AWAY. GO AWAY. OH, AND I WILL LET THEM DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. AND THEY CAN BRING THE NEIGHBORHOOD CHILDREN OVER TO PLAY. AND THEY CAN PLAY ALL OVER THE HOUSE IF THEY WANT TO. I DON'T CARE. THEY CAN PLAY IN THE SUNROOM. OH, PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS! AND THEY CAN RUN IN THE HOUSE IF THEY WANT TO. I DON'T CARE. AND MY CHILDREN CAN MAKE ANY COLOR CHICKENS THEY WANT TO. AND I WON'T PUT THEIR HEADS IN THE OVEN AND TURN ON THE GAS. AND I WON'T BURN THEIR HANDS WITH THE HOT IRON. AND I WON'T THROW THE SHOE AND HIT THEM IN THE THROAT. I WON'T HURT THEM WITH THE BUTTONHOOK AND THE KNIVES AND THE RUBBER TUBES. AND I WON'T PUT A FLASHLIGHT INSIDE OF THEM AND SAY, "YOU BETTER GET USED TO IT "BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MEN WILL DO WHEN YOU GET OLDER. "THEY'LL PUT THINGS INSIDE OF YOU, AND THEY WILL HURT YOU." I DON'T WANNA GROW UP, AND I DON'T WANNA BE LIKE THAT. NO, NO, NO. NO, NO. NO, PLEASE. PLEASE PUT ME DOWN. PLEASE PUT ME DOWN. DON'T TAKE ME IN THERE. DON'T TAKE ME IN THERE. PLEASE. PLEASE. WHERE IS SHE TAKING YOU, SWEETIE? WHERE IS SHE TAKING YOU? OH, IT HURTS ME. AND THE MUSIC, AND BRAHMS AND BEETHOVEN AND BACH AND--AND DVORAK. DVORAK AND THE NEW WORLD SYMPHONY, AND YOU CAN'T GET AWAY. AND THEY'RE COMING CLOSER, AND THEY'RE MARCHING. DON'T YOU LET GO, YOUNG LADY. YOU HOLD YOUR WATER. HOLD YOUR WATER TILL THE VERY LAST NOTE. [ducks quacking] [birds chirping] I AM SYBIL. AND I REMEMBER. AND I HATE HER. I HATE HER. I WANT TO HURT HER. I WANT TO STOMP ON HER AND TEAR HER APART AND CUT HER ARMS OFF AND PUT THINGS INSIDE HER AND KILL HER. HOW COULD SHE DO THAT TO ME? OH, GOD. I HATED HER SO MUCH. I WANTED HER DEAD. I STILL DO. I DO. I WANT HER DEAD. OH, DR. WILBUR, HELP ME. HELP ME. THIS SCARES ME. (Dr. Wilbur) SHE HAD REACHED THE CENTER OF THE MAZE AND COME OUT WHOLE. ANGER COULD BE HER FRIEND NOW. GREEN AND PURPLE WERE ONLY COLORS. SHE DIDN'T NEED TO FEAR THEM ANYMORE. YOU CAN REMEMBER WITHOUT PAIN NOW. WITHOUT PAIN? NONE OF YOU WILL EVER HAVE TO FEEL THE PAIN AGAIN. [sighing] I THINK IT'S TIME YOU MEET THE OTHERS. (Dr. Wilbur) 1. 2. 3. FALLING ASLEEP. 4. DEEPLY, DEEPLY ASLEEP. 5. NOW, I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO ALL OF YOU, AND SYBIL CAN LISTEN. HOW DO YOU ALL FEEL ABOUT MEETING SYBIL? HMM? WELL, IS ANYBODY THERE? VICKY? (as Vicky) YES. PEGGY? (as Peggy) I'M HERE, BUT I DON'T WANNA BE. HOW ABOUT THE REST OF YOU? (as Mike) DR. WILBUR, WE WANNA KNOW, IF WE MEET SYBIL WILL WE STILL BE ABLE TO GIVE A BABY TO A GIRL LIKE DADDY DID? WHO IS THAT? I'M MIKE, AND SID'S HERE, TOO. AND WE WANNA KNOW IF WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT LIKE DAD. WELL, YOU BOYS HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU LIVE IN A WOMAN'S BODY. YOU'RE NOT BUILT LIKE THAT. WE WILL BE WHEN WE'RE BIG. WELL, HOW ARE YOU GONNA MANAGE THAT? WE'LL PUSH IT OUT. WELL, I THINK THAT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE. WELL, YOU CAN HELP. MIKE, CAN WE SET THIS PROBLEM ASIDE, SWEETIE, UNTIL YOU ALL MEET SYBIL? 'CAUSE WHAT SHE NEEDS RIGHT NOW IS TO KNOW ALL OF YOU AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH YOU'VE ALL BEEN HELPING HER AND HOW MUCH MORE YOU CAN HELP HER WHEN YOU ALL JOIN HANDS TOGETHER. (as Mike) ALL FOR ONE AND ONE FOR ALL? (Dr. Wilbur) MMM-HMM. WILL YOU STILL LIKE US THEN? I'LL LOVE YOU. WOULD YOU PUT YOUR ARM AROUND US? (Dr. Wilbur) SYBIL, ARE YOU READY? (Sybil) YOU'RE THE DOCTOR. (Dr. Wilbur) WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET FIRST? WELL, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET VICKY. (Dr. Wilbur) ALL RIGHT. VICKY. VICKY COME ON OUT, SWEETIE. **[voice humming] BONJOUR. (Dr. Wilbur) VICKY, HERE'S SYBIL. (Sybil) LOOK, SHE HAS HER ARMS OUT TO ME. SHE'S SMILING. LOOK HOW PRETTY HER HAIR IS. DOES SHE WANNA BE FRIENDS? VICKY, DO YOU WANNA BE FRIENDS WITH SYBIL? (as Vicky) UH-HUH. YOU THINK YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE VICKY WITH YOU ALWAYS? YES. I'VE ALWAYS NEEDED SOMEONE LIKE VICKY. YOU WENT ON AHEAD FOR ME. WHENEVER I DIDN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO DO SOMETHING, YOU'D GO ON AND DO IT FOR ME. I LIKE HER, DR. WILBUR. YES, SHE'S A PART OF YOU THAT'S VERY STEADY AND VERY LIKEABLE. WILL SHE BE WITH ME ALWAYS? MMM-HMM. VICKY WILL BE WITH YOU ALWAYS. YOU AND SHE HAVE JOINED HANDS. LET'S DON'T SAY ANYTHING TO SPOIL IT. IT'S SO NICE LIKE THIS. IT'S SO NICE TO HAVE A FRIEND. AND SHE CAME RIGHT TO ME. THE OTHERS WILL COME TO YOU. (Dr. Wilbur) NOW THE OTHERS ARE RIGHT HERE, AND THEY WILL COME TO YOU ALSO. HERE'S MARCIA, DEAR. COME, GIRLS. CLARA, HELEN, MARGIE. AND THIS IS VANESSA, WHO KEPT YOUR MUSIC FOR YOU. SID, MIKE, HOP OUT, BOYS. NANCY. NANCY KEPT WAITING FOR THE END OF THE WORLD AND SHE'S THE ONE WHO DREADED ARMAGEDDON. AND MARY, THE MEMORY OF GRANDMA. SYBIL ANN. SYBIL ANN, DON'T BE SHY, SWEETIE. HERE'S SYBIL. COME ON, PEGGY. I'M AFRAID TO MEET PEGGY RIGHT NOW. (Dr. Wilbur) SHE'S AFRAID OF SCARING YOU. SHE DIDN'T MEAN TO BREAK THE WINDOWS. SHE GOT IT CONFUSED WITH SOMETHING ELSE, WITH GETTING OUT OF THE KITCHEN. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? SHE'S SPEAKING TO YOU, ISN'T SHE? WHERE IS SHE? IS SHE THERE? (Dr. Wilbur) OF COURSE. PEGGY. PEGGY. OH, COME NOW, PEGGY. DON'T BE SILLY. I DON'T THINK I'M READY YET. DR. WILBUR? IT'S ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE. I'M STILL HERE. IS THAT ALL SHE IS? JUST THAT LITTLE THING? I'M NOT A LITTLE THING. I'M A PERSON. (Sybil) I'M SORRY. YOU DON'T BE AFRAID OF ME, AND I WONT' BE AFRAID OF YOU. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT BEHIND YOUR BACK, PEGGY? HAVEN'T YOU GOT ANY HANDS? I GOT FISTS. OH, MY. LOOK AT THOSE KNUCKLES. THEY'RE SO WHITE. [crying] IT'S ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE. IT'S ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE. [sobbing] (Sybil) IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT. (Dr. Wilbur) IN ACCEPTING PEGGY INTO HER ARMS, SYBIL BEGAN THE DEEPEST HEALING OF HER SELVES. IN EMBRACING PEGGY, SHE EMBRACED HERSELF. IN CALMING HER, SHE WAS CALMING HER OWN HEART. AS I WATCHED HER BECOMING MOTHER TO HERSELF I FELT MY OWN LONG MOTHERHOOD ENDING. I RELEASED WHAT I HAD HELD SO LONG. I CELEBRATED THE BEGINNING OF HER EMANCIPATION. I LET GO. OUR WORK TOGETHER LASTED 11 YEARS. TODAY SYBIL LIVES PEACEFULLY IN A SMALL COLLEGE TOWN WHERE SHE'S A PROFESSOR OF ART. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME IN THE DAY FOR HER TO DO EVERYTHING SHE WANTS BUT THAT TIME, IN EVERY SENSE, IS HER OWN. SHE TELLS ME SHE'S HAPPY. I KNOW SHE'S FREE. * COLORS OF DREAMS * * RIBBONS OF RHYME * * COME OUT, COME OUT * * WHEREVER YOU ARE * * WILLOWS AND WINDS * * THAT WHISPER WORDS * * OF A SPRING SO NEAR * * A SUMMER SO FAR * * MIRROR, MIRROR * * IN MY MIND * * THERE'S SO MUCH TO SEE * * WALKING THROUGH * * YOUR SILVER ROOMS * * I REMEMBER * * ME **
