JACKAL OF NAHUELTORO Written and directed by Miguel Littin. In Chillan, on September 23, 1960, Jorge del Carmen Valenzuela Torres, under court order and urged to tell the truth, put forward: Jose's Childhood. The oldest memories I have was when I was about six years old. And my father, Carlos Valenzuela, worked at Olivio Fuente's property... in San Carlos. My father worked as a day laborer and lived on the premises, in a sort of hut... with my mother, myself and my younger brother. I can't remember his name, but I called him something like Piren. I was about eight when I left home, walking. I scrounged for food on the roads. Until I got to San Fabian. Take it like a man! - Excuse me, sir. - Feel at home, corporal, help yourself. Drink up, corporal, drink up! Not a bad looking little devil. But, you know, I spend little time here, corporal. And my aunt is too old to raise a kid, don't you think? It's incredible! They bring little ones to this world with no sense of responsibility! What has the poor kid done to deserve this? Someone should take care of these things. Another drink, corporal? Be my guest! - And from God. - The Father, The Son and The Holy Ghost! - How many gods are there? - There's only One! - And where is He? - In heaven, on earth and everywhere! Come in, Campos. What brings you here, corporal? - I wanted to have a word with you. - Of course, Campos. This way. And all of you better not stop! Silence! Do you know baby Jesus? Would you like to have your first communion, little one? Later, I went with the corporal to San Carlos, I did chores and took care of the pigs. A gentleman took me with him to mind the goats, gather firewood... I was there like eight months. Then another one took me to a place near the mountains... I was there for about a year. But, I found a guy that paid me more and... was more secure, so I went with him. I was there for about a year and a half and then I went with another boss that... paid me 1500 pesos a month. And brought me things now and then. But as this boss was too demanding... he used to send me to fetch firewood without warm clothes when it rained... He wouldn't let me get warm in peace... I left and... walking. Dozens of people have been at the Nahueltoro bridge since dawn, waiting for the judge and police authorities, who, along with confessed criminal Jorge Valenzuela Torres, better known as "The Nahueltoro Jackal", will reconstruct this horrible criminal act that... has shaken the population and which left six innocent people dead. Murderer! Murderer! Jose's Journey. Then I went on working on different properties... up until about three years ago... when I returned to my mother's house, and found out that I had two more siblings... born from her and my father's brother, Juan Miguel Valenzuela Enrique. A woman, Norma, and a man called Juan. I was like a month at my mother's house... and stole nothing. I just took a cloth from my sister. I worked at different places, until I got to Ralbunco... and was in jail for a while. After I got out of jail, I met... Maria Gonzalez... and stayed at her house for a few days. I had a fight with a nephew of hers that left me with some cuts on my hand. They say he was arrested. One of Maria Gonzalez' sisters threw me out of the house and... we left to search for work, walking. Couldn't find any for 25 days. Then I crossed the ?uble River. - So how much do you want for this junk? - You tell me. Where did you steal it from? Well, a sister of mine gave them to me... she lives around here. Just the shirt is OK. Forget about money. If you want a half-jug, OK. If not... Serve me up. Go watch the baby! And don't blow on the fire. Didn't you see the chickens? Shoo them downhill! Look, look! Are you looking for something? Need anything? Could I have a little water? - You're not from around here? - No. - Outsider? - Yes, m'am! Been around here a while? No, just got here. Have you talked to the boss? No, didn't speak to anyone. You can find him at the house. Lot of work? I'm alone, and five kids on top of that. Wouldn't wish it on anyone. It was different when my man was alive. Make that kid shut up! Time goes by and there's so much to do. You don't have to do that, listen! He was found dead by the marsh. Six knife wounds. On the marsh by the new road. Get to bed before you fall over the fire. Now, now! He wasn't a bad man. The fire is burning out. - Where are you going? - I'm leaving. - With this cold? What are you doing? Don't push me! Can't you see I'm taking the children out? Who sent you to do something like this? Watch it, leave that there! Who sent you to do this? God Almighty! I need the house, he said. You know m'am that I need the house for a... tenant that will work on the property. Didn't the dead man perform and work like a good Christian? Yes, but he's dead. You know I need the house. If you get stubborn, I'll forcibly evict you, he said. And I said: It's your decision. And around four they came and started to throw everything out mercilessly. Damn dogs! He said: What are you bitching about, darkie, don't you have the scoundrel that just arrived? He meant you. - My sympathies. - Thank you very much. This is as far as we'll go. I was lying there. It was about five in the afternoon... Rosa had brought me some wine from El Manco. Three liters. Did you drink it all? - No, she drank too. - A lot? Just a bit. That's why I was drunk. Where was she when you hit her? I was there on the side. And she was minding the fire here. And she was scolding me because I had brought her from Los Encinos. I got mad and grabbed a long stick with a knife and hit her with the stick end. You didn't use the knife? Don't remember, I think it was just the stick. And the stones? What did you use the stones for? Don't know what for. I can't remember. How can you not remember? So they wouldn't move anymore. You threw them on her. And then? Jovina came. She took off when she saw me. - And you chased her? - Yes, sir. What for? To kill her? Yes, sir. To kill her. Did you go on hitting her when she was on the ground? I don't remember, I was very drunk. - Why was Alicia here? - She'd come to fetch firewood. - And were you looking for her? - Yes, sir. To kill her? Yes, sir. To kill her. She was just standing there, looking at me without speaking. I hit her with the stick. Did you grab her neck? I don't remember grabbing her neck. He's lying, the body had signs of strangulation. The little girls were kneeling. I got close and hit them with the stick. Neither of them moved, I hit them with the stick. How long did it take you to kill the girls? I believe something like three hours. Why did you kill the children? So they wouldn't suffer, the poor kids. In Page 105, including information form Chillan prison, whereby prisoner Valenzuela was put at the disposal of the court, together with the objects found on his person, which were... a coat, a pot, a bed sheet... a tin spoon, two thread spools, and a file. In Page 101, Jorge del Carmen Valenzuela Torres, says that after killing Rosa Rivas and her children, he took 6,300 pesos he found in a basket and left the place. In Page 141, ... Pursuit and Capture. All available forces in the province are searching for... the Nahueltoro murderer, who mercilessly and cruelly killed... a mother and her six young children. Many neighbors have joined the manhunt. All sectors of society are outraged by this horrendous crime. In addition, there is fear that the Jackal may reach the border with Argentina. National Police forces have been sent... to the mountain border crossings to prevent an escape. There is a serious fear that this man could leave a trail of blood and death wherever he goes. The body of a little girl that had been raped has been found in another town. Also, the body of a murdered peasant was found this morning. Thus, the total body count would rise to eight for this godless and lawless criminal. For this murderer without peers in Chile's police history. A helicopter has been added to the search in the last hours. So we can assume that the Nahueltoro Jackal's days are numbered. Eight rifles are waiting for him to pay with his life for the horrible crime committed. What's your name? Answer, you piece of shit! In Page 35, the prisoner's defense... sustains that the lack of motive for the crimes of homicide and grievous bodily harm, should be investigated, considering the prisoner's personality and background, which indicate that since childhood he has led a life of suffering and ill treatment. This atmosphere created an abnormal personality with violent reactions... and unlike a normal person. With no respect for order or morals. Education and Taming. - It's pretty easy. - Not at all, there are people who have never managed. - And how's the writing? - Not so good, I'm better at this. Nice! You've got to play the ball, play it, understand? And never get dizzy with it. Hi! Did you win? Are you happy? It's nice to win, isn't it? Give me the shirt! Don't worry, go on. On May 21, at Iquique's anchorage, One of the most glorious events in our history took place. That day, Commander Arturo Prat and his comrades... chose to sacrifice their lives rather than haul down our flag. "As long as I live, this flag will fly in its place. And if I die, my officers will know their duty". Prat said to his men. "Viva Chile!" they shouted. And got ready to fight to the death. The Esmeralda was just an old, run-down schooner. While the Huasca was an iron behemoth with large canons, a cutwater and other deadly weapons. To the shout of "Stand by for boarding, boys" Prat jumped onto the enemy ship's deck. Finding himself alone, he made his way through the deck, sword in hand. All of a sudden, a coward shot him point-blank... a shot on his forehead that led him to death and glory. "I'm held at Chillan Prison, Mother, don't weep for me. I'm not the first prisoner. Don't tell me who I am." "The cell bars are full of mourning." "The stone with its stone, weeps after watching me cry". "Nearly four years locked up... and the sentence read: Death by firing squad". "Friends, my comrades, a favor before I die. Bring me my mother, I want to say good-bye". "Good-bye dear mother, root of all... Good afternoon. The guitar is turning out nice. I'm just learning. - Any sales outside? - I've got no one to sell it. I'm also short of materials, because these were lent to me. "When you see me dead, don't start weeping". "I'm just the ashes of your criminal son" "Nearly four years locked up... and the sentence read: Death by firing squad". And in agreement with articles 12, numbers 1, 26, 27... of the Penal Code, and articles 514, 527 and 528... of the Penal Procedure Code, the sentence of February 23 is hereby approved... Whereby in Page 45, with the declaration of the prisoner, Jorge Valenzuela... aka Jose Valenzuela, Jose Sandoval Espinosa, or Jorge Castillo, is hereby sentenced to death. For responsibility in the crimes of homicide of Rosa Rivas, Alicia Jovita and Rosita Sanchez... and theft of money and belongings from Rosa Riva... Crispan Nesa and Domingo Soto... for a sum of almost fifty escudos. It is hereby notified that the sentence is issued on this date, as during the agreement the following took leave and were absent... Jose?s Death. Valenzuela, I'd like to have a conversation with you now. A very relaxed one, like the one you just had with those ladies that were here. I want to ask you some questions that will bring back memories... of another time to you. I want to ask about your family. For example, how old is your mother? What does your mother do? My mom is 43 years old, sir. And she works on a farm. Works on a farm. Well, in all the conversations you've had, you've asked for help for your mother. Help, yes. I need help with money, so that when my mother comes... I can give her whatever I have. So that she can buy what she needs. Have you discovered new things here? Work. I've learned several jobs. And I've been able to feed and dress myself. Is it true you used to live on a ?uble River island? - Yes, on the island. - And what did you do there, work? No, I was just there. Another thing. Have you felt more comfortable in here, more at peace, than outside? I've felt calm. I'm more aware of life, I am. What other things did you do on the island? I don't know. I was just there. Another question. If your mother were here with us at the moment... if we carried her voice on this recording machine. What would you ask of your mother? I'd ask her to be calm. - Is that all? - Yes, just that. Do you regret the crime you committed? Yes, I regret what I did... because at that moment I couldn't tell... what I was... what I did. Do you blame the alcohol for your crime? The wine you drank? Yes, alcohol, and more importantly that no one ever taught me. I never had... education, nothing at all. Does it bother you to remember the crime you committed? Yes, it bothers me a lot. In your life here in prison, Valenzuela, through all the jobs you've done... especially basket-weaving... What else have you learned here? What other job? I learned to make portrait frames for 5000 pesos, and small guitars for 4500. Do you think the President could commute your sentence? Yes. I've always had that hope. What would you promise him in exchange? What... I promise him, if he commutes my sentence... is to be a humble working man. Useful to society. And to help my mother. What would you request from all the Chileans that are listening? What... I would ask in the first... is that... they help me in the request to the President. Jorge Valenzuela has just one chance of being spared. Which is if the President decides to commute his death sentence to one of life in jail. This decision has naturally been postponed... as the President of Brazil, His Excellency Mr. Joao Goulart, is visiting our country. Nothing will kill me now. I can feel it, father. Now I'm a Catholic. That's why I have hope that the President will commute the sentence. And what if he doesn't, Jorge? You'd have no right to consider it an injustice. What... what I promise him if he commutes the sentence... There's somebody you're not seeing, Jorge. - The day you see him... - At least I've always had that hope. Father, father, what has the President said? We're just a few kilometers from Chillan Prison. The firing squad, commanded by Captain Salina... is at this moment performing what we would call... a dress rehearsal for the execution that will take place at dawn. Captain, I'd like to ask you a few questions regarding the execution. Well, to be honest there's not much I can say. Both the officer and the squad have been chosen by drawing lots. So we're just here following orders from our superiors. Captain, why are they practicing the shooting? Well, it's a strategy to soothe the soldiers. Besides, it's a way of guaranteeing effective shots, thus avoiding unnecessary bloodshed. While also assuring an act within the majesty of the law. Captain, don't you feel any remorse for executing a man? Well, I talked it over with a priest and he gave me a satisfactory explanation. He said it was similar to when a doctor... amputates a patient's arm to save his life. To keep society alive, we have to amputate the sick arm, which is the criminal. Is this the first time you take part in a firing squad, Captain? No, I have a lot of experience in firing squads. And I can say that all my executions have been perfect. It's a sad honor after all, isn't it? What did your son say, m'am? Does he know he's going to die? Father, does he regret his sins? For sure, for sure. That is, he... Look... I think he's very aware... I mean absolutely aware... that his suffering now is deserved. So he's not angry. He doesn't feel hate or resentment towards anybody else. Not toward the courts nor his lawyers... nor his family, nor anyone. Because he's ready to face it... and pay for what he's done. Three bulls-eyes, boys. Aim has got to improve! I'll get shot here. This is how I sleep. This is how they'll shoot me. And... well, like I was saying... this could be a movie script. Like the case of the "Man with the Iron Mask", or something. But, speaking as a judge... I don't think your good wishes will come to fruition. It's proven without doubt, then, that Jose is Jorge. His name has never been Jose. He even has a brother named Jose. He's Jorge! But the presidential order named Jose, your honor. - No, it named Jorge. - No, it was Jose. No, it was Jorge. Because that's the main name. Besides, that's the name he's used... Used badly, I might add. On purpose. - For what purpose? - To hide. I was with your mother. Poor mom. I love her. - Since when? - Since when have you loved yours? Goodbye, canaquita! Best to you, little Juan! How will you die, canaquita? Without moaning, 'cause it would be bad! Look, I think it's obvious... that we're talking about a rustic person. A third-rate ruffian, let's say. "I'm held at Chillan Prison, Mother, don't weep for me". "I'm not the first prisoner, don't tell me who I am." "The cell bars... are full of mourning." Valenzuela! The Director has come to see you. He's come from Santiago. Valenzuela. Do you need anything? To see my mother, Mr. Director. Jose, look me in the eye. Don't worry about your mother. The prisoners' social service will take care of her. Thank you, Mr. Director. - His self-assurance is incredible. - What is most striking is... how he worries about his mother. Yes, they've done a good job, it can't be denied. The man is calm. He won't be a problem tomorrow. That would really be a good farewell, my friend Valverde. Father... bury me in San Carlos. It's that... when my father died... my mother started living... living with my father's brother. Miguel Valenzuela Enrique. When I committed the.... When I did what I did... "The cell bars... are full of mourning." "The stone with its stone, weeps after watching me cry". Father... I wanted to live... even locked up for life. I went to live with my uncle, Oscar Ortiz... who... had a beehive. My uncle is also with my mother. Father, maybe now that it's raining... No, Jorge. I left for the Monte Blanco property... where a cowgirl named Blanca... became fond of me. And she treated me like a son. I was like six months there. Until Ramon Valenzuela came to get me. And took me where my mother was. I'm not afraid to die, father. Because I'm going to Heaven. Campan, they called me Campan. Like the yellow roses that grow by the side of the tracks. Corporal Canto named me "canaca". "Nahueltoro Jackal". I liked it at the beginning. Poor mama. "I love her", I said to the journalist. And he took more pictures. Father, bury me in San Carlos, will you? I want to die like a man, father. I've learnt about... life here. Now I know I'm a person, and I feel Catholic and Chilean. Come on, boys. Let's go, it's time. I ask to die without a blindfold. I want to see. If you refuse to be blindfolded, you'll be doing those men that... have to shoot you a great harm. Do it for them, will you? - He's alive! - Nobody move! - Murderers! - Don't be ridiculous! Nobody's been murdered here. Fucking murderers!
