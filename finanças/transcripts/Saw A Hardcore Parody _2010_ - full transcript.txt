Roughly transcribed subtitle by XXS Who's there? Get me the fuck out of here! The fuck, are you fucking kidding me?! Get me the fuck out of here! Hello Jason, you've been placed here because of the way that you've been treating women. Your arrogance and demeaning behavior is about to be put to the test. You treat women like objects and your actions on film are not to be accepted by any standard society. You've done films for years, abusing and degrading women with your perversions for too long. Today, you will have to make a choice. The chain that is attached to your genitalia will pull you forward to a certain change in your perversions. And behind you is a device that will let you feel what your perversions have been inflicting on your bodies in your studio all these years. The button on the device will stop the pull into the shredder. And will reverse the chain to back you into your first anal scene. Make your choice. The game starts now. What? The fuck? Are you insane? Who the fuck did this? No! No! Please stop! People are going to pick up! No! No! No! No! No! No! Stop! Stop! Stop! No! How bad can it be? Saw Saw: A hardcore parody Maybe you should slow down a little bit. That's like your fifth bowl. Don't tell me when I've had enough pudding! I'm sorry. This case just got my panties up in an uproar, okay? The scumbags got the whole fucking porn industry scared shitless! Yeah, we know. So have you got any other leads other than this guy from MyPornProductions? You know, this guy's been one step ahead of us the whole time. You know, that's four murders so far. I haven't gotten any. Who the fuck are you? What are you doing in my office? Get out of here! You really are a pain in the ass, douche. And I don't like you. It's Roosh, not douche! And when the hell did we start hiring guys with piercings? Roosh! Bring me my pudding! What? What? Where? Yeah? What's the address? All right, we'll be right down there. All right. Lynne! We got a live one! Quick, Lynne! We've got a survivor! Lynne! Lynne, where are you? Lynne, we've got a survivor! Roosh, I'm right here. Why do you always do that? I'm sorry, Lynne. I just get excited. We've been sharing an office for six years now. All right, all right, all right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Come on, we gotta go. So what's up? I just got a call from an officer in the valley. They got another survivor, and this one's still alive. Come on, let's go! Quick, Lynne! To the squad car! Okay, Roosh. Why don't you let me conduct the interview? This way I know that we'll get the right information this time. All right, stop. Are you still upset about that convenience store murder? It was not my fault. Wasn't your fault? You taped over the store surveillance video with a clear shot of the perp's face. What was it again? Ass Blasters 27? No, it was Assault on Perineum 13. God, I love that movie. Hello, Amber. I'm Detective Lynne Hunts. I'm Detective Roosh. We're from Homicide. We'd like to ask you a few questions if you don't mind. Okay. Is Amber your real name or stage name? Stage name. I hate my real name. Look, I do need your real name for the report. Oh, her truth is Gina. I can understand why that would be difficult for you. Well, tell us what happened. I... Listen, just take your time now, honey. Just relax. Well, I was driving to... I mean, I can't even imagine how difficult this must be for you, but please try. I was in my car, and I... Just relax, honey. You'd be surprised how the smallest little detail can help us out in our case. So just relax and just tell us everything... Shut up. Are you done? Yes. Like I was saying, I was driving to my shoot the other day, and after I parked the car, I went around to the back to get my bag out. Well, someone came up behind me and pushed me into the trunk of my car. Then they put something over my face, and I got really, really dizzy. And the next thing I remember, I woke up to hide down to this wooden horse with this guy hanging in front of me. What the fuck? What the... Where am I? Who the fuck are you? What the hell's going on? I don't know. Okay, okay, okay. Who the fuck are you? I... I don't know. I just woke up here just like you. What's going on? I wanna go home. You're... You're Anne Marie. Yeah, and who the fuck are you? I'm your biggest fan. You're certainly not my biggest. I've seen bigger. What's... I don't know. I just woke up. I wanna go home. I wanna go home. Hello, Amber. You're probably wondering why you're tied down and have a swinging cock of one of your fans in front of your face. For years, you have been in the spotlight flaunting your talents of sex. That has made the average woman feel less adequate with her lovers. The man before you has admired you over the years so much that his passion for you has cost him his family and his job. And now, his life is in your hands. Your task should be very trivial of someone of your talents. Your task is to get your adversary off with your hands and mouth. If you do not get him off soon enough, the device behind you will thrust faster each minute until it takes your life. Don't think this is going to be all about pleasure for him. The collar around his neck is linked to the device behind you. For every minute you take, the collar will tighten up and cut off his ability to breathe. Live or die, Amber. Make your choice. Like I was saying... Excuse me, nurse. We're right in the middle of a very important interrogation. You like a nice fucking dirty... You like a nice fucking dirty, don't you? Nice fucking dirty and wet. Come on. Come on. No, no, no. Don't you quit on me. You fucking clowny. I'm not making you like me. Come on. I make you want to fucking cum, right? I make you want to fucking cum. Damn it. Come on. Come on. Please don't die on me. Don't fucking quit on me. I'm your fucking dream girl. I'm your fucking dream girl. We can do this. We can do this. Please work with me. Please work with me. Then I crawled out of there. And that's the last thing I remember. Next thing you knew, I woke up here. In the hospital. Oh, Rouge. Are you done? Uh, yeah. Unless there's something else you can think of. To add. Well, there is one thing I remember now that I think of it. when I crawled outside, I looked behind me. And there was a green door. And where were you when you saw this door? You were outside? It was an exterior door? Yeah, I was outside, behind the green door. You get some rest now, Gertrude. And thank you very much for all your cooperation. And don't worry. We'll get this guy. Honey! I'm home! What the fuck is this? I'm really lonely, and I need a cock really bad. Lonely? Talk about lonely. I'm on a goddamn desert with a bunch of guys. And my wife's home, and she's fucking the... Pool guy. That's it. We're getting a divorce. No, please! Don't divorce me. I need you. Are you fucking kidding me? Who wrote this shit? This isn't reality. That's right, fucking brainiac. It's porn. I mean, what? You're a 30-something-year-old pool boy? Why don't we just calm down? And why don't you give a line like... You know, you were gone so long, why don't you just join us? And that way we can get Tommy in the scene, and then we can all go home. So, 30 minutes, hardcore sex, and we'll call it a day, and we'll get out of here. Sweet. Let's just start it off from right here. Let's go. Ready, guys? And... Action. Honey, why don't you join us? Ah, that's... That's not a bad idea. It's a good idea, huh? All right, pool boy. We'll just make a little rotisserie out of my wife. Is your big fat gun there? It's so scary. So, Tommy, how long has this been going on? A couple months. I will let you slide. They're so sloppy. Are you going to crush me? Yeah? Oh baby your cock feels so good, I missed it so much, I missed it so much, I don't fuck this whole guy. Give it to me. Give it to me. Alright guys, that was fucking porno magic. Alright that's a wrap. You guys, everyone else have lunch and... I had a baby bite, it was burning my face. Yeah but over there... Good job guys, good job. Do you have a bathroom? Yeah, yeah honey, it's right over there. Oh, thanks. You're welcome. Hello? Okay, I'm not... Actually, what the hell is this? Here, you take a look. Ew! Yeah, what's that doing in my file? Did you stick that in there? I don't know, but I just lost wood. God, there's gotta be some way you and I can get closer again. Excuse me? I mean, um, closer to, uh, getting the sky. You know, there can't be that many green doors in the industrial parts around here, right? Well, you'd think. Humpsy. Mm-hmm. Sure thing. Right away, chief. That was the chief. He wants to see us right now. So, what is this story about this screwball case? Anything new? What's happening? What's up? Well, we did just interview a local porn star, Amber Rain. She's the only survivor of this fuck. She had a mouthful to say, but not much we could use. No, she did mention something. She mentioned a green door. Ring any bells, chief? What do you mean? Well, she stated that when she escaped, she looked back, and she was behind a green door before she passed out. Well, behind the green door was a movie. It had nothing to do with that one, actually. What was that, chief? Nothing, nothing. I'm just saying that behind the green door, I have no idea what that means. Well, I guess we're back at ground one. All we do know is that all of the victims were in the adult film industry. So, what do you suggest, chief? I suggest that one of you goes undercover. Get it? Undercover. Seriously, I'm serious. You have to go undercover. I'll tell you why. Because we got a tip that when Lexi Bell was abducted before she disappeared, this person saw things. So, I believe that Lexi Bell is going to be the very next victim. Okay, are you kidding me, chief? As what, a porn star? I can't do that. Really? All right. Rouge. I'm right on it, chief. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't have to see her shortcomings. I'm sure you'll make a fine porn star, okay? You're booked. Get out. Thanks, chief. You're welcome. A ton of dynamite with a two-inch fuse. I heard that. Truth hurts. What happened with you guys used to be such great partners. To tell you the truth, chief, this case has gotten him so flustered. I swear, he's taking it so personal. You just stay on it. I'm sure he'll come around. Thank you for the update. Okay, chief. Oh, by the way, where was your secretary? I didn't see her when I came in today. I sent her down for the old footlong. She'll be coming very soon. Okay, chief. See you later. Thank you. It feels really good. Let me tell you something. I'm going to need you to come home. I'll give you some of this in a second. I love you. I love you, sweetie. I love you. When I was younger, I could do it with one hand. Yeah, I know you could. I've known you for a long time. Can I do it now? Yes, you can. Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you. I'm going to need you to relax. I'm going to need you to relax. Enjoy it. Ready? Ready? Okay. All the time, you look at me. I love you. I love you so much. Oh, I'm so anxious. I'm going to check your records. If you're not talking right now, you can talk to me. Otherwise, you can talk to Alan. My two seconds. That is righteous good. Keep doing it. Hug me. Listen, honey. You have 20 seconds to make me climax. You got that? So you count down from 20. And on zero, I'm going to pop right in this area right here. Yeah. Okay, good. 19, 18, 17, 16, 15. You can go slower. 18. We'll pass the math. 12, 11, 10. 7, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1. Blast off. Want to taste it? Right on zero, huh? Very, very good. Well, it's because you're so good. I think you made me the best ever. Anybody else that's going to be stuck on four? Okay. Four. Three. Oh, man. Just take a few more strokes. Feels so good. I've got to get back to work. Trying to get this monster out of the city. Hello, Lexi. Your time in this industry has made quite a name for yourself. The world has watched you grow up from an innocent teen to a beautiful woman. Although beauty is in the eye of the beholder and comes from inside. And it takes brains to make it in this world. Some would say that you left your brains behind when you stepped foot on your first set. I know. I was there. The intelligence that is said to have been lost can only be regained by your task at hand. The chair that you are sitting in is electrified. The tray in front of you shows letters of a combination. It's the technical term to what you call in your business a blowjob. Put the letters in correct order and spell it out and you will be safe from harm. You have 60 seconds to find the correct sequence. Oh, no! No! Oh, my God! My car! My car! Oh, please! Please! No! No! Please! Okay, let me get this straight. So I come into the room, I talk to the girl, I guess she's going to take down my pants and then I'm going to take off her top, her bottoms, she strips it off. Oh, right. Yes. For the 15th fucking time. You say your line, she pulls down your pants, sucks the cock. Simple as that, man. Okay. I just want to get it straight. Okay. First time I'm doing this. All right, people. Let's do this. Set points. Keep your mouth fucking shut this time. Jesus Christ. All right. Quiet. And action. Hello. Can I help you? Yes, ma'am. I'm from the agency. Are you with the agency? That's what I just said. Yeah. Just do me a favor, okay, sweetheart? Precious. Just read the lines like they're written. Just read, say the lines, and suck the cock, okay? Okay. All right. All right. How exciting. All right. Quiet. Action. Whoa. You have a gigantic cock. It's bigger than my husband. Cut. The fuck is it now? What? What? Is there something wrong? Because there's nothing wrong from what I can see. Come on. Who cuts to this shit? Come on, honey. We're all professionals here. Let's just do the job, okay? All right. Quiet. And action. Oh my god, oh my god, I didn't know I had that much fluid in my body. Alright, and cut. That's a wrap people, good job Stubbs. Okay, yeah, thanks. I'll call you later. Can I talk to you for a minute? Look, just because we have sex, it doesn't mean I'm going to give you my phone number or go out to dinner. No, no, no, no, no. It's nothing like that at all. Why, do you guys do that a lot in this industry? No, never. Come on, make it quick. I heard you were on a set the other day, and you saw something going on outside the studio? Oh, yeah, I saw Lexi being carried out of the studio. I just thought that she was being carried out because she was overdoing her scene like she normally does. But when I noticed that she hadn't updated her Twitter, I think something's wrong. Why, do you know her? Well, actually, I'm not tempted. I'm Detective Bruce from the police. Oh, fuck. Did I just fuck a cop? I haven't fucked a cop since the night I got pulled over for being drunk. Well, I'm sure that was a really good video. But listen, we've got to talk to you about this girl. Now, did you see who took her out? Did you see the car or anything she was put in? There was a big man, kind of thicker man. He was like 5'10". And he got in a little old car. Right. That was it. Did you get the license plate? No, are you kidding me? She normally gets carried out of the sets every time. Okay. Well, listen, here's my card. If you think of anything, give me a call. Okay? Sure. Hey, subs. What's up, my man? Good job in there, bro. Good porn. Have a seat. She's really sexy. Yeah, where she lacks in the lines, she makes up for the sex. So, she's a good kid. Really great. I've got a question for you. I just got a call. There's a scene tonight. My normal guy can't show up. So, it's a little bit, it's super, super hardcore. And I just want to see if maybe you might be interested. Oh, yes, yes, yes. You want me to do it? Yes, I'll do it. I'll do it. Thank you very much. Cool, cool. Yeah, no problem. It's at 9 o'clock tonight. I'll text you the address and I'll meet you there later on. Okay, great. Good job, man. Thanks, thanks. All right, man. Okay. See you later. So, how did your undercover go today? Pretty good. They asked me to come back tonight and do another one. Really? Oh, and I got a lead. The girl that I performed with, she saw the girl that's missing being carried out, put in a car and driven off. Did she at least give you a description of the perp? Yep, she did. Great. What are you working on? Well, I've been going through the tapes and the files of the previous murders. For some reason, this one just sticks out in my head. There's something about this particular one that just, God, doesn't make sense. What, that his dick's bigger than the others? No, you asshole. What's with you and always talking about penises? You going gay on me? I'm not gay. What? Come on, Lynn. Don't you remember those two weeks that you spent together on this stakeout on the, uh, what was that, the Salton murders? Yeah, right. How could I forget? You got drunk and passed out almost every single night. And I fucked you in the ass. So what's rocking your brain? In the video of the first murder, I noticed a five-digit number painted on the floor. I know it must mean something. I can't figure it out. I've been rambling my head on it for a while now. Show me.

Well, maybe it means nothing, or maybe it's just a cluster of victims. Okay, the first murder, which is this one, and there's three victims. And the second was the single POV porn producer. And the third would have been two, but Amber survived. Yeah, you know, could be. How about a date? March 12th, 1953. Shit, this guy's been ahead of us the whole time. You know, maybe it's a cop.

The chair that you are sitting in will slowly start to heat up to the point of scorching your flesh. Heidi! She will stay alive as long as you can direct your wife in your newest film. The men, along with your wife, will be subjected to a toxic nerve gas if you refuse. You will direct your wife in a gangbang scene that will end with her swallowing all their loads. That sucks.
