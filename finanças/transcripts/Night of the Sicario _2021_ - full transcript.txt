[THUNDER CRASHES] [RAIN POURS] [REPORTER 1]: Hurricane Vera currently a Category Four storm and strengthening. A lot of damage is expected, especially from the winds... [REPORTER 2]: ...is announcing that the trial against Los Urabenos drug cartel has been postponed due to the weather... [REPORTER 3]: The case against the Colombian drug cartel may be Hurricane Vera's first casualty. Courts, city officials, all being sent home... [REPORTER 4]: Please follow emergency evacuation instructions. If unable to shelter in... [REPORTER 5]: Moving fast and expected to be through the D.C. Metropolitan area in the next hour. [REPORTER 6]: Don't be fooled by clear sky... [REPORTER 7]: Hurricane Vera, currently a Category Four storm and strengthening. Catastrophic wind damage is expected. Mandatory evacuations have been in effect but that window is already closing as the storm is about to make landfall and the outer bands are already here reminding so many of Hurricane Sandy a few years back. The D.C. and Virginia area directly in the crosshairs. [MAN SHOUTS IN SPANISH] [AGENT]: Let's tie this bird down. They're shutting down the airport. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Rapido, rapido, rapido. Everybody in. [THUNDER CRASHES] [RAIN POURS] [REPORTER]: A very dangerous situation right now. If you look behind me you can see what we're seeing now streets practically empty. Everyone who was supposed to evacuate has done so for the most part. [KNOCK ON DOOR] We're looking at a strong Category Four at landfall, so... [WOMAN]: Can we go over this? [REPORTER]: A very dangerous situation right now. I just wanna make sure we have the correct info for your testimony. [THUNDER RUMBLES] OK. [THUNDER CRASHES] Your work with the cartels started five years ago? Six. So, our sources tell us that they recently moved their money into a cryptocurrency. Do you know anything about that? And the flight? They landed. They're fine. They got in just before the storm. They should be here soon. They're all I have. Amelia and her father. You understand? I need to know that they will be safe. I will testify... but I want it in the papers. Promise me that we will be protected here in the US not in Colombia. We can't go back there. It's not safe. You don't know what they've done to my family there. Promise me. Yes. It's in the witness protection agreement. You have nothing to worry about. I promise you. [THUNDER RUMBLES] [AGENT]: Not too far now. A few more miles, we'll be at the safe house. [TIRES SCREECH] [MAN]: OK, got 'em. Heading south on Mission. [HE SPEAKS SPANISH] OK? [HE SPEAKS SPANISH] [HE SPEAKS SPANISH] [LOUD CRASH] [METAL SCRAPES] - [THUNDER CRASHES] - [GIRL GROANS] - [AGENT 1 GROANS] - [GIRL GROANS] [AGENT 2 GRUNTS] - You guys alright? - Everybody alright in the back? - Uh-huh. - I'm good.

I thought we hit them. They're around here somewhere. They're not here. Let's get out of here, man! Agent Armstrong, you copy? This is Agent Bennett. - [ON RADIO]: Do you copy? - [RADIO STATIC] - [RADIO TRILLS] - This is Armstrong. What's your status, Agent Bennett? [BENNETT]: We have the girl and her dad. We've commandeered an [INDISTINCT]. Headed to... to rendezvous point Nakatomi. West on Hamel. ETA ten minutes. You stay here, if they come! - Where are you going? - [HE SHOUTS IN SPANISH] [RADIO PRESENTER]: Evacuation orders have gone out... [WOMAN SIGHS] Yes, no, I know it's a lot of money I'm asking for but you know I'm good for it. Come on, Don you've been servicing our loan since my dad... Yes. Yes, no, I know my credit rating is not great right now but you know it was the divorce that caused that. Let me ask you one thing. - Would you even consi... - [PHONE CLICKS] Hello? - [THUNDER CRASHES] - [DISTANT ALARM BLARES] [ALARM GROWS LOUDER] [ALARM BLARES] Linda! Taylor, where have you been? - They're freaking out. - [KEYPAD BEEPS] - Who turned the fire alarm on? - [ALARM STOPS] Who do you think? Fire alarms are not for fire emergencies only. They can be used in case of any emergency to notify the proper... OK. OK, Arthur, we got it. Thank you. Any word on the county van? Can't reach 'em. You're kidding. They're supposed to check on our pick-up an hour ago. - Phones are down. - Ugh! Crap! They're late. Where are they? We've got to get everyone out of here. Can you try the landline? - I tried it. It's out too. - [TAYLOR]: The landline? Well, not because of the storm. [SHE SIGHS] I can't believe they shut us off in an emergency. It's a freaking hurricane. [TAYLOR SIGHS] I take it the call with Don didn't go well? I think this is finally it. Come on, don't give up so easy. You promised him. Well, my dad was a big dreamer, OK? I'm a realist. I can't save everybody. You know, I did everything I could. This is it, Linda. Where is everyone? I'm here! [THUNDER CRACKS] Rose? Ida? [SHE SIGHS] Any... Anything on the vans yet? Lines are still dead. What are we gonna do? [SHE SIGHS] [DISTANT CHATTER] Again, Hurricane Vera, currently a Category Four storm and... [MAN]: Oh, is Fonzy cooking again? I'm not gonna just stand here and listen to this guy. Who do you think you are, bossing us around? He's a colonel. Lieutenant Colonel. Yeah, right. "Colonel", with air quotes. See? Air quotes. [TAYLOR]: Hey. Hey. What's going on in here? - And why is the food out, Fonzy? - I'm hungry. You're a stress eater. Yeah, and don't think we don't know you've been cooking in your room. Yeah. So? You have anger issues, too. Yeah, but... [HE SIGHS] I'm working on it. You gotta tell this guy, T we got a van coming to pick us up. He says we have to stay here and shelter. Yeah, shelter in place. And it's not me, it's the news. It's too dangerous to go out there anyway. Look, if you have a problem with it you can take it up with the authorities. You want us to stay here and get blown to smithereens? You tell him, T. Well, the truth is, everyone I'm not sure the evacuation van's coming. - Oh, good Lord. - [OVERLAPPING VOICES] Hold on! Hold on, everyone. Hold on. Are you sure that's what you heard about shelter in place? Yeah, Sheriff Rightmire held a press conference said everyone in the county who hasn't already evacuated is to shelter in place. We're not to leave. Is that what everyone heard? I heard it. I heard it, too. OK. Alright. - Well, shelter in place it is. - [ARTHUR]: Oh. Let's get everyone back to their rooms for now, OK? Mm. She don't look good to me. Tired. I'll get the candles out in case the power goes out. It'll be romantic. Eh, Rosie? You keep your candles to yourself. - [MEN CHUCKLE] - [ROSE]: Mm. - [MAN GRUNTS] - [AGENT PANTS] Stay down. [THUNDER CRASHES] Let me take a look at that. You need to put pressure on that. Hold tight. We gotta leave. Let's go. [MAN GROANS] Keep low. Keep low. [THUNDER RUMBLES] Uh... Back to your room, please. Oh, come on, T. - Thank you. - [TAYLOR CHUCKLES] All of you, just for now, please... [RAIN POURS] Ooh! Wiggle it. There's a trick to it. [TAYLOR GROANS] Oh, I always forget that. [SHE GRUNTS] OK. [IDA HUMS] How do you always stay so calm in all of this? [SHE CHUCKLES] I've been through a few storms before. - It'll be alright. - [THUNDER CRASHES] - Alright... - [SHE HUMS] If the power goes out, the monitor has a backup battery and that'll... That'll kick in, OK? So, just leave that on. How did I live 93 years without that thing? [THEY CHUCKLE] That's not what's keeping my heart going, honey. - Yeah, well... - [SHE CHUCKLES] I know it's hard times here right now. [SHE SPEAKS SPANISH] Don't worry about your life, what you will eat or drink. Look at the birds of the air. They neither sow nor reap and yet, your heavenly Father feeds them. Don't worry. He'll provide. [THUNDER CRASHES] I wish I could believe that. [SHE CHUCKLES] You will. Just like your father. Do you want me to help you get back into bed? No. I'm fine. [TAYLOR SIGHS] - [LOUD THUNDER RUMBLES] - [HEAVY RAIN POURS] [THUNDER CRACKS] [SHE SNIFFS] [SHE SIGHS] [KNOB CLANKS] [KNOB CLANKS] [THUNDER RUMBLES] No. No, thanks. [FONZY HUMS] Ladies... No. Go sit down. [DISTANT WIND HOWLS] - [TAYLOR GRUNTS] - Oh, let me help you with that. Sorry. They wanted to be together. It's hard to say no. Although, technically, Taylor's right. FEMA recommends staying in interior rooms in situations like this. Whatever, nerd. I'm just saying, don't blame me if we all get buried in debris. Oh, Arthur! Just take them all. Put us all out of our misery. Oh, no. Today's Tuesday only. You do not want to combine Tuesday and Wednesday, trust me. Mixing days equals purple haze. Alright. Alright, kids, that's enough. We can stay in here. Alright? Just for now though. - How's she doing? - We're hanging in there. [KNOCK ON DOOR] [THUNDER CRACKS] DEA. Can we come in, please? Need help. [TAYLOR]: Come on in, sweetie. Cole Bennett, DEA. Hi, I'm Taylor Ward. I'm the owner of this place. What happened? Is he hurt? Is this is a medical facility? - Assisted living. - [LINDA]: What's going on? [TAYLOR]: Linda, can you please grab them some towels? - Do you have a doctor here? - I'm a nurse. No doctor, no. - What happened? - We've been in a collision. These people are under my protection as possible witnesses in a federal trial. There's a FEMA command post about eight blocks away. The phones are dead. I've gotta make it there on foot. Can I leave them in your care? - Ma'am? - Yeah. Of course, yes. Yes. Taylor, what's going on? Can you prep room 203, please? We'll put them up there. [COLE]: You'll be OK. Like I said, we're assisted living. I'm not... I'm not sure I can help but I'll do whatever I can. Appreciate it. You'll be alright here. Take care of your father. [HE SIGHS] Thank you. [TAYLOR SIGHS] Just come right in here. There we go. [SHE GRUNTS] Alright... - Let's take a... - [MAN PANTS] I need to take a look if I'm gonna be able to help you. What happened? Que paso?

[DOOR CREAKS] [SHE GASPS] [SHE WHIMPERS AND GASPS] [SHE CHOKES] [CHOKING STOPS] [THUNDER CRACKS] This is a bullet wound. I'm not equipped to take this out here, OK? I'm gonna dress it as best as I can until I can get you to a hospital. - Did you get through with 911? - No, the storm, it's... I need gauze and supplies. We're out of gauze. You're kidding me. Alright, here, put some pressure on that. Let's go take a look, alright? Come on. [HE SPEAKS SPANISH] He went up the road. From your mama. Take it. Keep it... - always. - [SHE SOBS] No... [HE SIGHS] [HE SPEAKS SPANISH] Little sparrow. Don't worry. It will be alright. Keep it. Es muy importante. Prometeme. Promise me. [HE COUGHS] Prometeme. I promise. I will. [MEN SHOUT IN SPANISH] OK, let's see what we can do here, huh? [SHE SIGHS] OK. - [SHE SPEAKS SPANISH] - [HE GROANS] We are followed. Being followed? By who? Men. Bad men. Sicarios. OK, let me take a look at this. - [SHE SIGHS] - [HE GROANS] [SHE SIGHS] He's bleeding out. He's bleeding out. Linda! - [HE COUGHS] - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shh. It's OK. Amelia, help me calm him down, sweetheart. - [HE PANTS] - [TAYLOR]: It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. [DOOR RATTLES] [TAYLOR]: What was that? I hope that wasn't a branch going through a window. Linda! [LOUD BANG] That was no branch. Amelia, I want you to do me a favour here. Give me your hands. I want you to put a lot of pressure on there, OK? More than you think you should. I'm gonna be back as soon as I can. OK, lock this door behind me and then put the pressure back on, OK? [HE GROANS SOFTLY] - Papa. - [HE WHEEZES] Papa. Stay right there. - OK. - [MAN]: You in charge here? Yes. There a man and a little girl here? [SHE GASPS AND SOBS] - A man and a little girl here? - [SHE SCREAMS] Huh? [HE SPEAKS SPANISH] Told you we hit them. - I'm gonna ask you... - No! - One last time. - [ROSE WHIMPERS] - Is there a man... - [ROSE SOBS] ...and a little girl here? - You have two seconds! - [SHE SHRIEKS] OK!

What's in there? Nothing. It's just a laundry room. Knock on the door and tell them it's you. Tell them to open up. [SHE SIGHS] Hello, it's me. Can you open the door? Move away! [FRANCISCO COUGHS] [FRANCISCO COUGHS] [HE COUGHS] [MAN]: Ay, pobrecito. You don't look good, Paisa. Let's do this quick. Where's the code? Where's the code? Is it on a chip or something? Flash drive? Something? Hey. - [HE COUGHS] - Hey, hey, hey. Wake up. [HE SPEAKS SPANISH] Where is it? Hey, hey, hey! Look. Look at me. Look! Is it... Is it in here? Huh? Hey, hey. Dígame. Tell me, where is it? Or I'll do to you what I did to your brother. Dígame. Dígame, eh? [HE SPEAKS SPANISH] You think you could turn your back on us, huh? You think these Americans are gonna protect you more than me? Hey, hey. Hey, look, look, look... I don't care if your wife testifies. I don't care. That's my uncle's business. Hmm? He sent us here to take you out, but forget him. He's not as considerate as I am. Look, look, look, look... You give me the code, we split it. [HE SPEAKS SPANISH] We do our own thing. Hmm? I'll give you as much as you want. You, your family, you walk. Hey, you give me that code and we're rich. We're very rich, my man. [HE CHUCKLES] Hey, hey... I just need that code. You... You have it? You... Your daughter has it? [HE SPITS] [HE SPEAKS SPANISH] [FRANCISCO GROANS] Think you can turn your back on me? - [TAYLOR]: Hey, hey, hey! - [FRANCISCO GROANS] Please, stop. Please. He needs medical attention. What do you know? I don't know anything, I swear. - They gave it to you? - They didn't give me anything. I swear. Hey, hey, hey! Where's the money? - Where's the money? - [HE GROANS] Tell me, where's the money? Where's the money, huh? - Where's the money? - [HE GROANS] Hey! Hey! Hey, hey. Hey, wh... where's the money? Hey, where's the money? Where's the girl? I don't... I don't know. - Wait! Wait. - What? Wait. You want a flash drive or something, right? If it's that, I... I have a place... - Walk. Walk! - OK. OK... [SHE GASPS] - [RAIN POURS] - [THUNDER RUMBLES] What's this? Um... Plug it in. Plug it in. Step away. [THUNDER RUMBLES] [WIND HOWLS] What? I'm hungry. [SHE SOBS] [SHE SIGHS] [DOOR CREAKS QUIETLY] [HE CLICKS TONGUE] [HE SIGHS] [AMELIA WHIMPERS SOFTLY] [SHE PANTS] Uh, business hasn't been so great lately. Yeah? You think you have it bad here in this big fancy mansion? It's not what it looks like. I inherited this place from my father. [MAN]: You have no idea. Your dad religious? He started this place as a church ministry as a way to... give back to people that... had spent their lives helping other people. Yeah, he was. So was I... then things happened. [KEYBOARD TAPS] [WIND HOWLS] [AMELIA SIGHS] You ever invest in cryptocurrency? You should. See... I'm in a family business, too. You do what you gotta do. So do I. [KEYBOARD CLACKS] [THUNDER CRASHES] Where is that? These are old. We don't even use them... - [SHE GROANS] - Enough with the games already! Take me there now. Walk! [WIND WHISTLES] [FLOORBOARD CREAKS] [FLOORBOARD CREAKS] [WIND HOWLS] [MAN]: Move. Move! [HE SHOUTS IN SPANISH] Amelia, run! [HE WHISPERS]: Hey, no gun. No gun!

[LIFT DINGS] [DOOR CREAKS SOFTLY] [LIFT DOORS SHUT] They're not going anywhere not with this storm. Let's just wait. What are you doing? - Como? - What are you doing? This place got about 100 rooms. You wanna go through 'em all? The girl. Guzman sent us to end this. [HE SPEAKS SPANISH] Shh. Don't worry about my uncle. We're doing it my way. Oh, yeah? Yeah. OK. They'll come to us. [LIGHTER CLICKS] [HE EXHALES] [SHE SIGHS] [THUNDER CRASHES] [THUNDER CRASHES] [DOOR CREAKS] [LIFT DINGS] About time you guys invited us girls to your club. We'll make an exception today. Is everyone OK? [ROSE SNIFFLES] Mmm... Poor Linda. I just can't believe it. Poor, poor Linda. She ain't never done nothing wrong to nobody. Nobody! [ROSE SNIFFLES] [COLONEL]: W-we can't just stay down here. We need to come up with a plan. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah? Who made you captain of the ship? I'm sorry but where are we gonna go, huh? We can't just leave Taylor alone up there. T-that's what I'm saying. You gonna lead us into battle, Mr Fake Colonel? [ROSE]: Will you leave him alone? What is your problem? He acts like he's the boss when he's no different than the rest of us. Isn't that right? Tell 'em... "Colonel"! What is wrong with you? This is hardly the time to... No, he's right. He's right. I'm not a colonel, if you must know. I was in the Army... but when my battalion shipped out, I couldn't go. Turned out I had a spinal condition. Unfit to serve, they said. So, I spent the whole Korean affair in an office behind a desk. Never fired a shot. Though, I did rise up through the ranks. It was easy, when all the men... all the real men were gone. I was a major. I was set for promotion to lieutenant colonel and then my battalion came back, most of them. And they said "Fraser... you're gonna be a lieutenant colonel?" [HE CHUCKLES] We had a good laugh about it and they saluted and laughed. So, when it came time for the promotion... I denied it. Just said, "never mind." So, you're right... I'm not a colonel not even a lieutenant colonel. I don't know any more or have any special qualifications to get us out of this mess than anyone else here. So... [HE SMACKS LIPS] There it is. Oh, who cares? My husband spent the Korean War making a fortune sneaking beer provisions and then selling them on the side. Listen, ain't none of us heroes. What we gonna do now is what I wanna know. [IDA MURMURS] [ROSE]: Ida? - I... - [IDA]: Hold my hand. That's it. Come on. Come on. Oh, Heavenly Father... we come to you now. We need you. [ROSE]: Yes, Lord. Is this gonna be one of her long ones? Please watch over the girl... the little girl, Father. - Keep her safe. - [ROSE]: Mm-hmm. [IDA]: Protect her from this evil. Keep her safe... under the shadow of your wing. [ROSE]: Thank you, Lord. [IDA]: And we lift up Taylor to you now, Lord. [ROSE]: Yes. [IDA]: We pray that she turns to you now. [DOOR CREAKS] [SHE SIGHS] [IDA]: Her burden is heavy but your burden is light. And keep us all safe in this storm. [VOICE BREAKS]: We know that trials happen... but You are greater. [SHE SOBS] [SHE SIGHS] [IDA]: Help us all to trust in You entirely. - In Your name, we pray. - [TAYLOR SOBS] - [IDA]: Honour His name. - [SHE SIGHS] [DOOR OPENS] Oh, sweetie, it's just me. It's OK. I'm not gonna hurt you. You can trust me. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Shh. - Shh. It's OK. - [AMELIA GASPS] It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. These men, they're looking for something. Some kind of code or something. Do you know what it is? No. If we find it and give it to them, they'll go away. Are you sure? I don't know. OK. We've gotta get outta here. If I can get you out of this house do you think you can run to one of the nearby neighbours and get us help somehow? - [TREES CREAK] - [WIND HOWLS] [SHE SIGHS] OK, it's not safe. We better find somewhere safe for you. Let's go. Come on. [DOOR SQUEAKS SOFTLY] Alright... On my signal... we run. Three... two... one. [LIFT DINGS] [LIFT DINGS] [DISTANT CLATTER] [SHE WHISPERS]: He goes down, we go up. You live here? You're rich. It just looks like that. Trust me. [SHE WHISPERS]: This way. Come on. [AMELIA]: Oh, wow. [THUNDER RUMBLES] [TAYLOR]: Right here. Right through here. You must have a big family. It sure feels like it sometimes. Where are they? Oh, don't worry about them. They're pretty resourceful. They'll be around here somewhere. Come on. Right through here. Right this way, sweetie. [SHE SIGHS] OK. Alright, don't judge. It's OK. My room's messy, too. OK. Wow. I haven't been in here in a long time. You did this? Not recently, but... yeah, when I was about your age. [SHE SIGHS] Well, I almost forgot. [AMELIA]: What is that? Well, it's... a place where I keep important things for safekeeping. [SHE CHUCKLES] [AMELIA]: Who is that? - That's me. - That's you? [TAYLOR]: That's my mum and dad when they were still with us. This was taken on the day they opened this place. They wanted to open a place for poor people so that when they got older, they had a place to live. [SHE CHUCKLES SOFTLY] [AMELIA]: Who are all those people? These were people from the church. People that donated their time and... and their money so that we could open. I remember this day. They were all in the entrance of the church and they were saying this really long prayer and... all I could think about was, "When are we gonna eat?" [SHE CHUCKLES] Look at those smiles. I haven't seen that in a while. Amelia, I have to go and check on... [AMELIA]: What is this? That was my favourite shell that my best friend gave me. [AMELIA]: Do you have a brother or a sister? Do you? Not anymore. I had a sister... a big sister. I'm sorry. It's OK. I hardly remember. I was little. It was the cartel. Do you have kids? No. Oh. I wanted to, but I couldn't. Sorry. It wasn't meant to be, I guess. Sometimes we just have to trust God has a different plan. [THUNDER RUMBLES] [THUNDER CRASHES] [SHE SIGHS] I need to go downstairs. I need to check on my friends and make sure they're OK. OK. I want you to stay here, though. You'll be safe here. OK. I will. [SHE SPEAKS SPANISH] What does that mean? Get rid of them. [THUNDER CRASHES] [HE GRUNTS] [DEFIBRILLATOR WHIRS] - [SNAP] - [HE GROANS] [THUNDER CRACKS] [WIND HOWLS] [GENERATOR CLANKS] Taylor? Hello? [WIND HOWLS] [GENERATOR CLANKS AND WHIRS] [MAN]: Hey! Come here! Come here! Come here! Come here! Come on. Come on! - [TAYLOR SCREECHES] - [HE GRUNTS] [THEY GRUNT] [TAYLOR SHRIEKS] [SHE GROANS] - [HE GRUNTS] - [SHE SHRIEKS] [SHE YELLS] [HE WAILS] [THEY GRUNT] Enough! [GUNSHOTS] [WIND HOWLS] [HE SPEAKS SPANISH] [THEY SPEAK SPANISH] We do it my way. We wait. [THUNDER CRASHES] [HE SIGHS DEEPLY] So... No one knows anything, huh? You have something that belongs to me. You give it to me and we... we go. Look, I told you, we don't know what you're looking for. OK? We don't have anything to do with this. [SHE CRIES] [HE MUTTERS IN SPANISH] - [TAYLOR]: No! - [HE SPEAKS SPANISH] Sit down! You will tell me. Tell me where it is! I don't know. I don't know what it is. The code from your papa. Where is it? Where is it? That's enough. You have to know! You tell me! No se! No se, por favor! That's enough! None of us. Listen to me. I wanna talk to you. Tu y tu muchachos. Mira, mira! You have done enough here. You have done enough! You and your men will leave this place and never come back again. This is a good place... a safe place. You don't know this, so I am going to tell you. When her father opened this home he dedicated it with a verse a Bible verse, Isaiah 25:4. "A refuge for the needy in their distress... a shelter from the storm..." A shelter from the storm! That is perfect! Especially for today. Do you know what else Isaiah 25 said? "In that day they will rise up and they will say 'Surely He is our God. We trusted in Him... and He saved us.'" He saved us! So, you... can threaten us... you can hurt us but you cannot destroy us... because we are safe. Not in this house... we are safe in Him. He is our fortress. And now, get out! - You're not safe! - [SHE WHIMPERS] How dare you? How dare you? Who do you think you are? She's a 93-year-old woman. Ninety-three years old and she has more courage in her little finger than you will ever have. You are a coward! A coward. [MAN]: Shut up. [GUNSHOT] Go! Go! Move! [GUNSHOTS] - [GUNSHOTS] - Help me with this. - Push! - [GUNSHOTS] [TAYLOR GRUNTS] - [FRASER]: Push! Push! - [TAYLOR GRUNTS] - [THEY GRUNT] - Stay down! [GUNSHOTS] - No... - [GUN COCKS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUN CLICKS] [THUNDER CRASHES] [GUNSHOTS] What are you doing? You're gonna get us killed! [GUNSHOTS] - [BULLET RICOCHETS] - [HE GROANS] - [HE YELLS] - [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] [THUNDER CRACKS] [RAIN POURS] [COLE]: It's all clear in there. Everybody OK? Is she alright? No, she needs help. I'll be right back. - Any other bad guys? - [FRASER]: You alright? No, just the three. Where's your dad? Donde tu papa? I'm sorry. Are you gonna be OK? You sure? [QUIETLY]: I have to ask you something. [HE SIGHS] Where's the code... that your dad had with him? You don't know? I know it's difficult right now, OK? But I need you to think real hard for me. I don't know. You sure you don't know where it is? It's very important. OK. No problem. Listen up, everyone. If I can just get your attention for a minute. I'm Cole Bennett with the DEA. There's an important piece of evidence this young lady and her father were transporting as part of an investigation. Without it... some very bad men will go free. What is it? What does it look like? Not exactly sure. It's a code on a computer drive, a chip of some kind. Have any of you seen anything like that? - [ROSE]: No. - [ARTHUR]: No. Are you sure? [FONZY]: We're sure. Can I ask you again? I want you to think, honey. Think back when you first got here with your dad. I don't know. I cannot remember. Come on. Think! What's going on? [THUNDER RUMBLES] Let me guess... [SHE SIGHS] You're looking for a code. Do you know where it is? I don't know anything about your business. None of us do. One of you... does. What are you doing? Listen to me. Tell me where the code is. Where is it? Your father had a bag... a black bag. Where is it? Speak up! Where is it? Ah... All of a sudden, you know things. Let her go. [SHE GRUNTS] [SHE GROANS] All of you stay here. Do you understand? Stay here! [FRASER]: Understood. - [SHE GROANS] - [FONZY]: Oh, my God. - Are you OK? - [SHE PANTS] [MONITOR BEEPS] Miss Taylor? Come on. Alright, stay with me. [IDA]: The girl... she's OK? That's OK. It's OK. Hang in there. Hang in there. I got you. - I got... - Listen. [IDA GASPS] Trust... [SHE GASPS] Him. - [SHE GASPS] - [MONITOR BEEPS] [MONITOR FLATLINES] [SHE SOBS] No... [SHE CRIES] No, no! [SHE SOBS] No... I... [SHE SHRIEKS] I can't! Oh... I can't, I can't. Oh! I can't do this anymore. I can't do this any... [ROSE]: Miss Taylor. - [FONZY]: Hey. - I can't... I... Come on now. Snap out of it. [SHE SOBS] [FONZY]: It's gonna be OK. Ida would say that. That's right. One step at a time. That's what she'd say. Trust the next step. [SHE BREATHES DEEPLY] [FONZY GRUNTS] [SHE SIGHS] [CLOCK TICKS] Hey... You hear that? Hmm? Exactly. Me neither. [ARTHUR]: Must be the eye of the storm. [TAYLOR SIGHS] You know... I think I like that look. Where you going? I'm gonna take that next step. [SHE SIGHS] This way? Come on, let's keep looking. [HE GRUNTS] [SHE SCREAMS] No! Come on, Amelia! Go! Go! Alright, let me think. Hide. Hide here. Hide here. - [RAIN POURS] - [SHE PANTS] OK... What do you think you're doing, huh? You know where it is. - [GUNSHOT] - [HE GROANS] You want to keep that money for yourself. It's mine. You know how many years I put into this? Filthy barrio slums. - [GUNSHOT] - [HE GROANS] Filthy slum rats... bringing drugs in here. Whose side are you on? They're killing my men. Our men. That traitor... and his daughter are in the middle of it. So was her mother. And I will get rid of that little runt, too... if she doesn't tell me what I wanna know. - [TAYLOR SCREAMS] - [HE GRUNTS] [BODY THUDS] [THUNDER RUMBLES] [SHE PANTS] Come here. - [RAIN TRICKLES] - [THUNDER RUMBLES] [TAYLOR SOBS] [THEY SOB] I'm so sorry. - I'm so sorry... - It's T! It's T! [THEY CRY] It's OK. [SHE SOBS] It's OK. [ROSE SNIFFLES] [HE SIGHS] [WOMAN]: OK. Thank you. Excuse me. - Here you go. - Thank you. Amelia, do you know what these papers are? A little bit. Miss Ward is applying for foster care. Do you know what that is? I think so. It means that, if you want to... you may be able to stay here for a while. I can stay with her? Well, there are a few things to go over, but... we might be able to make that happen. Oh, just a sec. I think I know where she might be going. We'll be right back. OK. [TAYLOR]: What's that? My father gave it to me. He said it belonged to my mother. It's very pretty. He told me not to let anyone have it so I hid it here, like you did. Can I see it for a second? [SHE SCOFFS] Your father was right. This is a very, very special necklace. Someone I was very close to once told me that all you have to do is trust. An abuelita? Yeah. That even when you think something's impossible there is always, always a way. My father was right about this place. It's very special. Like my necklace? Yeah... like your necklace. This is a very valuable gift. Make sure you cherish it always. Ooh, what is this? Oh, wow, I haven't seen that in a long time. Do you like to draw? - [AMELIA]: Yeah. - Me too. [AMELIA]: At home I had a bunch of pictures in my room. [TAYLOR]: You did? [CHATTER CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
