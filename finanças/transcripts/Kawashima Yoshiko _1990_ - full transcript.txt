In 1911. the Ching dynasty was overthrown. China abolished its monarchy. Immediately the country was divided up by the warlords. A period ofgreat turmoil began. In the 1920s. the Kuomintang defeated the nation's entrenched warlords. Meanwhile. Communism began to spread throughout the country. In the 1930s. the Kuomintang turned its attention to purging the communists. This gave Imperial Japan to invade north-eastern China. In 1937. the Sino-Japanese war began. In 1945. Japan surrendered to China. Ah Fook. Don't move. Where's Kawashima Yoshiko? I am Commander Kam Bik Fai. Kawashima Yoshiko. Peace! Victory! Down with the Japs! Extra...Traitoron public trial!

I thimk we'll have to return him im a couple of days. It's alright. Ah Fook! What's wrong? Don't! Ah Fook! Hold on... He imsists on seeing you. You've lost weight. Worryimg about my country and my people but having nothing to do! It's a rare opportunity to get some rest. Tientsin is so much warmerthan the North-East. Aren't you imvitimg me to your room? Don't you want to ask me to hand someone over? Who? Thewhole city knows I've been harborimg an anti-Japanese revolutionary. For Commander Kam to conduct herown interrogation ofa rebel is nothimg unusual. But don't over-exert yourself or my heartwill ache. What do you want mefor? Commander Tanaka. please. As a belated birthday gift. and to express my tanks to my warrior's sword. who even during convalescence has taken it upon herself to give her heard and effort forthe great East Asia Prosperity Zone. I sent someone especially to get a pufferfish. Pufferfish are poisonous. Eating it could kill you. but if you don't eat it you'll miss out on one ofthe greatest delicacies. Do you dare? I find that warriors these days preferto use guns and tanks. Their swords arejustfor decoration. Let's drimk! I have to leave. When are you goimg to send me imto battle. Commander Tanaka? The Communists are ineffectual. the Kuomintang turns a blimd eye to the economic imcursions ofthe Western Imperialists. Thewhole of China needs a savior now. But it's not you. You're drunk! I've been drunk fora long time. I said long ago that women are like cats. They like the stink offish. Tanaka. the cats in Chima can become very vicious in orderto protect their young. They'd ratherdevourtheirown young than let someone else take them away. Go! Are you ok? You could have killed him. I had no bullets. You're goimg? Goodbye. Did I say I'd let you go? Tanaka's men arewaiting at the doorforyou. What's the date today? Where are my friends? We have the same yellow skim. I've neverforgotten I'm Chimese. Why do you treat me like this? You kill Chinese! Didn't Sun Yat Sen ill Chinese? We have no money. no knowledge. no guns or ammunition. and no science butwe do have people. Sacrificing a few may brimg strength and stability. Don't say anymore! I don't understand... Call me a traitor I won't mimd because at least then you'll admitting I'm Chinese. But I have not been used by the Japanese. Isn't our Emperor now the head of Manchuria? No... He'sjust a puppet. How do you know? Have you seen him? Today Manchuria is the most developed and wealthy part of China aswell as beimg the most sophisticated and stable area. The Nationalist Government & the Communists arefightimg day & nightwhile people suffer. What for? The Japanese are not so terrible. No. I'm a man. I've pledged loyalty to my country. Right! Use the Japanese to create orderfrom chaos. Once we're united we can recuperate until we have the strength to drive out the Japanese. No! No man can be loyal to two masters. Do we still have the strength left tofight a war? We've been fighting ourselves forover a decade. Nowwe have to fight the Japanese. Do you know how many morewill have to die? Why are you so brutal? Why so cold-blooded? I don't know. But this is not what the University students says. Never mind them. The Japanesefirimg squads have killed them all. You're the only survivor. Ifyou must kill. why not kill mefirst? They're knowledgeable. they're learned. they're... They'rejust a mob. They were stirrimg thimgs up. They're too naive & imexperienced. Shut up! No right to meddle in state's affair. Cloud. Do you knowwhy I saved you? My life is yours. You want it. you take it. Thank you. 1937. Japan officially launches a full-scale invasion of China. 1940.

The slightest agitation and itwill break apart. So cold! Nothing has ever been done. A perfect dream! It's snowimg. How did it get wet? A perfect dream! Do you knowwho I am? Go ask your Commander! When I threw a party. what a scale it would be! What guests used to come! How many ofthe leaders ofthis government haveworked under me? You small fry! What right do you have to even open your mouths before me? Submit the evidence. Miss Yoshiko. Don't make them angry. Kam Bik Fai. do you recognize this book? This novel contains imformation supplied by you concernimg your collaboration with the Japanese. and youracts of betrayal in schemimg forthe imdependence of Mongolia. You yourself said itwas a novel. Have you read "Journey to the West"... and "Golden Lotus"? The devils and the whores im those boos have you arrested them yet? Your honour. This book is written by Japanese. The content is bound to be biased. I object to it beimg submitted as evidence. Do you recognize these people? I don't. Lying! Thefirst one is Mongolian Primce Genzui Zabu.

The second one. Amakasu Masahiko. the agent ofthe fake Manchukuo. Amakasu Masahiko was an active memberofthe cultural and artistic circles of Manchukuo. There is no evidence to indicate that he's an agent. The Tokyo international Military Tribunal did not prosecute Amakasu Masahiko. The last one. Tanaka Takayoshi. is an officer in the secret service ofthe Kwantung Army. You worked for him and you were his mistress. This is Miss Yoshiko's private affair. Silence! Silence!
