How about this party breaking up? My old dame's been out every night this week. What does she think I'm made of? Mr. Lawson's car, please. Mrs. Copperwaithe's car. Nice party. Always the same. Carters are the best hosts in New York. Oh mother, shut up. I won't shut up. I think it was disgraceful for Michael Carter not to be there. You don't really, darling. You're just cross because I didn't get to meet him. Hmm. You talk as if I had desires of lovemaking. Those scoundrels Bob sent us. Someday you'll be sorry for flirting around with all these married women. Ah ah ah, Attie, you've been making snoopy again. I merely approach by, oh, a matter of well– Yeah. It isn't the approach that bothers me. It's the follow through. Jim Curzon is a good husband to Diana. Attie, we're passing a bar. I think a little soda would do you good. Yes, a soda would do me good ? after I had a slug of brandy. Good night, mother. - Oh, good night, my dear. Good night, father. - Good night, Diana. Good night, mother. - Good night, Jim. Good night, Jim. Good night, sir. Oh, Diana. It's very obvious, Diana. And I don't like it. If it were true, it couldn't have been obvious. I'm a little lost too. I heard people talking. What did you hear? That Bob Prentice is going to work again. Why can't he go to work? You know what I mean. He works only in one field. I won't stand for it. Nor will I stand for this. It's so stupid. Where is he? Where is he? Now don't get nervous, Katherine. Oh, don't tell me not to be nervous. So, I have the properties. And I gave this one just to Michael to meet that girl. Where does he go? What does he do? My dear, you're becoming hysterical. Hysterical? Don't say that to me! Where are my pills? I have them here, my dear. To browns and one white, isn't it? Yes, of course. Oh, Michael. Michael. Well now, there's some things. What things? Well. Anyway, he doesn't get in honest scrapes with women. Well, I rather wish he would. No no no. It's two whites and one brown. Where on earth does he ? Here here here. And don't say "here, dear" to me. But where is the water? It's right in your hand, my dear. Oh Ah, good evening, Benson. Steady, old boy. Steady. Let me…. I got it. I got it. Oh, can't go upstairs yet, Benson. I gotta go in and say hello. You know how it is. You better go to bed, sir. But the guests, Benson. The guests. The guests are gone, Mr. Michael. Benson. You don't want me to meet the guests? Mmm-hmm. And I could've been so nice to them tonight. Yes, sir. I have a lot of milk in me. Milk, sir? Milk of human kindness. Yes, sir. Have you got any milk of human kindness, Benson? No, sir. Benson? Sir? Did you ever sit on the clouds? Clouds, sir? Yeah. Clouds. Crowds of clouds. No, sir. Clouds of crowds. Up on the clouds with an angel. Sitting on the moon, Benson. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Just sitting right there. Look, Benson. Benson. Benson, look. How's this? Lovely, sir. Ah, your breakfast, sir. Benson here. You remind the angel, Benson. You're American. Tomorrow. Yeah. What am I going to do, Benson? Marry an angel. Yeah.. You…said it. You be talking strangely, sir. About going through the clouds. And sitting on the moon with an angel. Oh. Just drunk. Yes but ? He kept saying he was going to marry the angel, sir. Tomorrow. Oh. That kind of an angel. Good night, Benson. Good night, sir. Mary White. Is that the name? Yes, sir. She's a stenographer at the Acme Luggage Works. Thank you, Morton. Chat's all. Good night, sir. Good night, Morton. Butterfield 8-2598, please. The Carter residence. Has Mr. Michael Carter left the house yet? I beg your pardon? Oh, this is Mary White. A friend of his. Mr. Carter didn't come home last night. You don't mean he didn't come home at all? Hello? Hello? Hello? Vanderbilt 3-9970, please. Hello. Is this the University Club? Will you see if Mr. Michael Carter's there? And if not, will you see if there's any message for me? My name is Mary White. Come in, please. Oh, just a moment. Mr. Carter. Mr. Michael Carter. You won't be able to find him, my dear. So you might as well hang up. Who are you? I'm Mrs. Curzon. Michael's sister. What happened? Tell me quick. Has he been hurt? No, no. No, he hasn't been hurt. But you may be. And then again, you may not. Please tell me. I'm almost crazy. You thought you were going to marry Michael today, didn't you? Thought? Of course I did. I don't see how he can do these things. My dear, he has no more an intention of marrying you than ? I don't understand it. What are you talking about? Please, sit down. And I'll try to explain. I believe you're a stenographer, aren't you? You see, this isn't the first time this has happened. Incidentally, he get some sort of kick out of promising to marry girls like you. Anyway, that's the only way my family can explain it. And then at the last moment ? Well. He just leaves them at the church. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. I don't believe it! He loves me. I know he does! I'm sorry. Vanderbilt 3-9970. You think I'm a fool? Because I'm a stenographer? Any girl knows when she's loved. Do you think I love him because he's rich? No! I love him because I love him! And because he loves me. Hello? This is Mary White. I spoke to you a moment ago about Mr. Michael Carter. Do you remember? If he were there. And if not, did he leave any message for me? Mary White. Yes. He did? What? He asked for…? I can tell you where he is, Miss White. He's left for France Oh. Yeah. Yeah. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. Listen, now. I know what it is to be in love. I'm married, myself. But love isn't everything. In spite of all they say. And I didn't come with just bad news. You see this? It's a very large check. My father feels very bad about it all. And here. Here's a ticket to California. The change is so valuable at a time like this. You know that. And Mary. Really, you'll get over it soon. Oh, god. No! Well, Mr. Clinton. Congratulate me. My brother will never marry little Mary White. Got away with it, huh? Completely. What else could she think, when we all said he left for France? Yes. But don't you really think Michael will phone her when he wakes up? No, my dear. She took the check, didn't she? Wait till he finds that out. You're a clever woman, Di. If you weren't, your husband would have shot me long ago. And if you aren't careful, my sweet, I might do it for him. Argh! Argh! You don't mean that she's a girl that Mike ? Get out of this street before anyone sees us. Quick, Bob. That check. Father's name. She was restive, officer. I was a sitting right over there. And I saw her standing by the window there. Suddenly she stood up and fell forward. Like she had fainted. Anybody else see it happen? I saw it, officer. And right at my feet! She practically fell right at my feet. Oh! You. You! You! Calm yourself, dear. Oh, but this is a scandal. And a terrible one. What are we going to do? What will people say? Oh, stop worrying. Nobody knows except Morton and Benson. And you know them. They won't talk. Oh I couldn't go to the police. Oh, it's so like her kind. Completely without control. Mr. Michael is awake, sir. Thank you, Benson. What are we going to say to him? What are we going to do? Oh, he'll flip. Now, dear. Stop it, mother. We've got to see this thing through. Here. Try this. You think I dare? Oh. Boy oh boy, who gave me this one? Benson! Benson! Coming, sir. Coming. Oh. Oh. A trifle weird this morning, Benson. Yes, sir. Was I drunk or something last night? You were just a trifle moony, sir. I'm out on my feet. Imagine. Today of all days. What time is it anyway, Benson? 11:51, sir. What? Holy smoke. Telephone. Michael. Oh, good morning. What's the convention? Dear boy, you must listen to me. Just a moment, please. What's the matter, ma? Please! Please, Michael. You don't want to marry that girl. Don't want to wait a minute. How did you find that out? Oh, I see. A trifle moony, eh? Well, mother, now that you know ? Oh, please, Michael. Don't! It'll only bring disaster. Michael! You must believe her. You must! You must! Now wait a minute. You should all be congratulating me. Your little boy is happy. Don't you want your little boy to be happy? What did you raise him for, to be miserable? Naw, don't you worry. You'll all love her when you see her. You wait. I want Chelsea 3-20… Michael. I'm happy, sis. I'm all listened out. Chelsea 3-20… Hang the phone up! It's the last time I'm telling you. If you don't bring off and get off that line ? I know. I'll cut you off without a penny! Hello, Mary? Hello, is Miss White there? Oh, excuse me. I guess I got the wrong number. Huh? Well, who are you? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I don't get you. Who would you say you were? The janitor? She what? She did? She jumped out the window. She's dead. Oh. You don't seem surprised. Why aren't you surprised? Hey. Why don't you look at me? What are you so worried about? What happened? WHAT HAPPENED? Told her I didn't want her. Didn't you? Yes. We told her you didn't want her for your own good. So…you killed her! Nonsense. But you did. You killed her! You killed the only girl I loved. Loved? Disgraced, you mean. 21 Letha Way. You spied. All of you. My family. My precious family. I damn you, murderers! Murderers! That's what you are! Before I'd ever live with you again, I killed myself. But I'll do more than that. I'll pay you back. Move this way. Quick! Come get me. Now let's get these pins up. Now let's get these pins up. Yeah. Where's the nearest saloon? Now let's get these pins up. Well, thanks very much. Sheep herders. Most of these Indians around here. Pretty good at it, too. If you can think up a reason for liking sheep. Three days from now, if you're around here, you can get your ? Hey! Give me a drink. Sure. You get to see their ceremonial dances. They dance for two or three days. That's supposed to bring on rain. Whiskey. Go peddle your beads. No got beads. You give me a whiskey. I pay. Funny thing. It generally brings rain too. Some people don't like them. But they like for it to rain, don't they? Me want whiskey. Here. Help yourself. Get out of here, Pete. What's the idea? It's against the law to sell it to him. Oh. Hmm. The law. Huh? People always telling you what to do. I ain't sticking out my neck. What you say, Indian? Whiskey. Now you get me in trouble. It isn't against the law to give it to him, is it? Well, I'm taking a chance. Isn't that too bad? There you are, Indian. Help yourself. How? So that's where "how" came from. Here's to "how"! How. Hey, have another? Sure. How. - How. Now remember, Tonita, I didn't sell it to him. He give it to him. Hook, now. Wait a minute. You don't let her run you like that, do you? Well, you're a man, aren't you? You keep out. Are you a man or aren't you? Sure. Well, then. How? - How? My dear. Let me give you a little advice. Never, never as long as you live, ever take a man out of a bar. He never forgives. Or forgets. No good. Me? You. Prove it. I know. But my dear lady. I'm drunk. Sober just the same. Oh. No good drunk. No good sober. No good. No good. Well. Let's drink to it. That's funny. A moment ago, there was a glass there. Now it's gone. Hey, good shot, Indian. Good shot. Go on, hit! Nice shooting, Indian. Nice shooting. Wait a minute. That one's mine. It's got my initials on it. It's my turn now. Gimme that. I hope you're dead. Are you crazy? You want him to hang? Oh. He ain't dead. We've got to get that bullet out. I'll go for the doctor. No. No, that'll get us into trouble. We we gotta get him away. Hide him. Savvy? Savvy. Do you know where my shack is up on the mesa? Yeah. You take him there. You're right, sir. You go to the reservation. Pronto. Get me box. White man's medicine. In my tepee. No, wait. Wait. You're drunk. My father will never let you come back. I'll go. Hello. How? It's Miss No Good. How do you feel? I feel rotten. Oh oh – oh. That's where the bullet is. Bullet? Oh, yeah. I remember now. We were shooting. Now I have to get it out. Yeah? - Yes. I see. Hey, wait a minute. For what? Is the white man yellow? What happens if you don't get the bullet? You'll die. Well, that's all right with me. Just yellow. Yeah. Now hold yourself quiet. Now wait a minute. Have you done this before? No. But I'm going to do it now. I know first aid. Where'd you learn that? My father sent me to school. I learned many things at college. All right. One of them being that I'm no good, huh? All right. Go ahead. All right. The red man is the only man that can stand pain. My grandpa was captured by the Comanches. He let them cut off his hand, finger by finger. But he wouldn't tell them what they wanted to know. They cut off his arm clean to the shoulder. He never made a sound. Yeah. But I'm not your grandfather. It must've been awful tough, trying to shoot an arrow with one arm. Oh, he got even with them all right. My tribe rescued him. The Comanches who tortured him were taken. He had been staked to the ground. Their skin torn off in little strips. They died. Playful people. You Indians. They call us braves, don't they? Tonita. Am I dead? No. Going to live? Yes. Have you got a drink? No. Then I'm going to live. How do you feel? Oh, swell. You were pretty good. I was surprised. Well, I can rest. It must have hurt. Hurt? Oh, no. Now put it back. And let's do it all over again. You want to see the bullet? Hi, bullet. Would you like to keep it? It's all yours. How is your boyfriend? My what? Mr. How. Oh. He's all right. Well. So am I. Lie back. No. I'm all right. You do as I say. Oh, be good now. You'll stay if I have to hold you. All we seem to do is look at each other. And will keep on looking until I let you go. You must love that big Indian. What do you mean? Don't you think I know you're doing this for him? That's true. But I don't want you to die either. Oh, I see. Go to sleep. Nice navy. Good day. Well, you have to do something. Look. Look. All the way through college, huh? Well, I suppose I didn't see that. I don't think you did see it. Just crazy. Love you. Hmm? Nothing. Oh, I thought you said something. I was just thinking. Well, don't ever do that. I can't give them much for the tune. But it sounds alright. That means something to you? It probably means that I'm on trial. Trial? For what? Staying here with you. What a nurse. They wouldn't understand that. Well, I'll tell them. They won't believe you. Now wait a minute. I can explain all this. I know. Who's the old buffalo talking? My father. What'd he say? They said you must wear the garment of grief. And what do they do to you? To them, I'm dead already. This is ridiculous. I disgraced my tribe. Disgraced? Where have I heard that before? Disgraced? That's a hot one. Disgraced? Well, what happens now? Oh, it'll be all right. What's all right about it? The good sisters in Albuquerque are getting some wood. And the big Indian, he'll go with you? I'm all through with the big Indian. Why? Hmm. That's great. That's a beaut. On account of me? That's a funny one too. That's great. Once I was too good for somebody. Hmm. Now I'm not good enough. But I'll do more than that. I'll pay you back. Boy, you said a mouthful. Listen. Let me ask you something. Suppose you did marry the big Indian. How do you get married around here? Well. They bring you the skin of a grizzly bear. And beads of turquoise. That means "I love you. " And then? Then I put a necklace of white beads around his neck. That means "I'm happy. " Look. In this hand, I have the skin of a grizzly bear. And in this hand, beads of turquoise. You don't mean… - I mean this. I mean were going to be married. And I'm going to take you away from here. I'm going to take you to my home. You're going to meet my family. And will they be surprised. Will they be happy. Happy? Nobody could be so happy. Repeat after me. I, Tonita. Take thee Michael to be my wedded husband. I Tonita take thee Michael to be my wedded husband. To have and to hold from this day forward. To have and to hold from this day forward. For better, for worse. For richer, for poorer. In sickness and in health ? Oh, that's pretty weird. Huh? Oh, repeat after me. For better, for worse… Our little house. Your little house, my dear. I'm in there. Good night. Michael? Hmm. Why did you marry me? Why do you think I married you? To play Solitaire, I guess. Come in. Well, we're in Albany. It won't be long now. Say, would you mind writing a couple of telegrams for me? My arm's no good. Thanks. Mr. Hubert Carter. Stuyvesant Trust. Wall Street, New York City. Dear dad, I'm on my way home with my wife. Arriving Grand Central. 11 AM. She is the most wonderful girl in the world. And how you will all love her. Mother will be so proud. As she is one of America's first families. Meet us at the station. Michael. You got that? Fine. Mmm-hmm. Fine. Hello Hello. Oh. What? You look happy. - Mmm-hmm. Well, that's great. Will you do something for me? Ask me. When we get off the train, I want you to wear those pretty Indian clothes. You do? - Please. But your family? What will they think, Michael? Won't they want me to look like one of them? Don't you understand? I want them to see you for the first time just as I saw you. And who's the bride, Mrs. Carter? We don't know. Michael is keeping it a secret. Really? It's one of his little idiosyncrasies. Here you are, dear. All right, Eddie. How about giving us a chance? Okay. Would you mind standing back here for a picture, please? Right back here. That's fine. Michael has come through at last. I never had as many photographers as that. Hold it, Mr. Carter. - Hmm? This is exciting. Maybe Mr. Prentice is coming in. Smile, please. Oh, here he comes. Can she be...? There is a branch of the Donnelly family out there somewhere. Yes, her cousin, Attie, wasn't it? Oh, I remember. He went to Princeton. Yes, yes. But he could have a grown daughter by now. Oh, the most delightful people. There's Michael. There. Oh. Oh. Well. At least he didn't lie about her being from one of America's oldest families. Boy, but this is a story. Come on. Hurry up. Me too. The boys from the wire, Mr. Carter. Fine. How are you? I think I'm going to faint. Run along, father. It hasn't been easy. All right. Be polite. Keep quiet. I've got you. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, boys. He has to meet the family first. All right, boys. I'll be right back. I promise you. I'll be right back. Isn't Mr. Carter a direct descendent of… Well? There she is. Tonita. This is my mother. I'm I'm very happy. And I'm uh – Of course, it's a great surprise. And this is my father. As a matter of fact, our father. Aren't you, father? I'm very pleased to meet our father. Oh, well, I I – uh – As you can see, father's pleased too. And, uh, this is my sister Diana. And her husband Jim Curzon. Welcome, uh, to our family. You don't look a bit like Michael. No. That's how we get on so well together. Oh, you'll be crazy about your sister Diana. I'm crazy about them all, Michael. There now. Mother, did you hear that? Now isn't she sweet? Yes, so black. Oh, yes. Yes. You should see her father. He wears his the same way. Oh, stop, Michael. All right, dear. Now we're got to get busy. My family can't have you all to themselves. The whole town is waiting. And they're not going to be kept waiting in vain. We'll be back soon. Mr. and Mrs. Carter. Is it true...? Tell me, Mr. Carter. City Views would like to know... City Views would really like to know... And is Mrs. Carter an Indian princess? Say something into the microphone, please. Now stop it! This is enough! Stop it! Let's get away from this. Wooo. Stop! Stop it! Get out of here! Get out of here! What's she mad at? Oh, but in any event... - Steady, dear. Nteady. Someone just stomped us. Oh, I can't stand it. Give me my salts. What will Mrs. Sykes say? What will Mrs. Lawson say? What will they all say? Katherine, control yourself. Not so loud. We can't have this as nobody. Mr. Fulton knew about it. Won't the papers be full of it? Will they know it if they see it in the papers? Yes yes, dear. But they mustn't know how we feel about it. That's what I mean. We've got to think fast. They'll be here any moment. Miss Smith. Just a little higher, please. Remember. You're addressing one of the first ladies of the land. Now. Once again. Welcome home, Mr. Carter. - Welcome home, Mrs. Carter. Very good. Mrs. McGregor. Can't you stay in line? Good to see you again, Benson. It's good to see you, sir. This is Mrs. Carter, Benson. Well, uh, ahem. Welcome home. - Welcome home, Mr. and Mrs. Carter. Michael. Is it a home or a hotel? It's only 50 rooms but we call it home. Where's the family, Benson? They're waiting for you in the library, sir. Oh. I've been buying cameras. Cameras, sir? - Mmm-hmm. And iodine. You should have been there, Benson. Come on, dear. I'll show you upstairs first. Oh, Diana. Yes, mother. Father's right. Nobody must know how we feel. I won't be laughed at. Yes. But what can we do. Can we hide her under the bed? Hide her? No, mother dear. We are not going to do anything of the kind. We're going to bring her out. What? What what – what are you talking about? This is what happened to our family. That Indian with that shiny black hair? No. We're going to give a party. The biggest party ever held in New York. Everybody will be there. They'll all come to laugh at us. Well, they won't laugh. I'll fix Mrs. Squaw so you won't know her. And everybody's going to believe we are just crazy about her. Oh, Hubert. How do you do? How are you, Hubert? Now, my dear. Where is the Indian? Diana. Perhaps she's inside. I'll go get her. Come in. Why, Tonita. It's late. Why aren't you ready? I'm ready. But what have you got that on for? You must be crazy. Michael asked me to. Oh. So he showed up at last, did he? I I saw him this afternoon. He's been busy all week staying with friends. He had so many friends here. I see, all right. And now, my dear. We are going to get busy. This is the dress you wear. Oh, but ? But Michael wanted me to wear this one. It was my wedding dress. He said ? But Michael isn't going to get away with that. Well, you know what I mean. There's one thing you must learn about white men at once, Tonita. Never listen to them about clothes. And wait until he sees you in this. He'll adore you. When does the circus get it, I wonder. She's just great with bow and arrows. Nonsense. It's a horse. She can't find a horse. Of course, it's a horse. You can't ride round roping beaus without a horse. Good evening. - Good evening. Come come, Katherine. You know I've seen you in your house before. Where's Michael's bride? In a moment now, Carol. I came all the way from Pittsburgh just to see her. We'll get there in town. It must've been an amazing experience, Katherine. Most amazing. Mother-in-law through a storm cloud. I can see her. You know, I've never seen a red skin. Quick! Hey look! There's old Charlie Williamson. If he wasn't walking, I think he was dead. Katherine. I'm really going to do it. I'll spit in his eye yet. Hello, Michael. Hello. Big night for you, huh? Yeah? How have you been? I haven't much of you lately. It's tough. He doesn't like me very much, does he? For what reason? That's what I want to know? Give me one. And, hey. I don't like you very much tonight either. Yes, I know. The lunch we didn't have. We did have an engagement, didn't we? We did. But I had to go down to Wall Street. Of course. There are no telephones on Wall Street. I'm sorry. Hello. What are you two birds talking about? And what do I want to drink? I was telling him about Tonita. The stage is all set. - Hmm. Hello, Van. How are you? I'm fine, Jim. And you? - Fine. Out in Manhattan. What's new? Oh, nothing. Oh, I wouldn't say that. And I certainly admire your taste in women. What you mean? I don't get you. No. And you certainly didn't get me this afternoon. I was at the ballgame too. And I waved and waved. Your attention was evidently all for the blonde lady. Not that I blame you. She was a beauty. Well, it looks as if it's going to be a nice party after all. Jim, hello. Well, hello, friend. Excuse me. Wall Street hostess. Don't worry about that. So that was nothing, huh? Nothing. How dare they do that to me. Now, Diana, please. Don't make a scene. He's dead. Your love did it. Not so loud. I could kill you. You'll get fat threatening me. I'll do anything I please. Is that clear? This is so exciting. Is it really my party? Hmm. Very nice. And this is my daughter, Mrs. Copperwaithe. And Mrs. Copperwaithe. How do you do, my dear? Mrs. Copper what? I didn't get the last part of the name. Waith. Spelled W-A-I-T-H-E. But pronounced Waith. I'm pleased to meet anybody. I might as well know what your name is. Or else just say "Howdy. " Howdy suits me. Come on, dear. Where's Michael? I don't know my dear. He's around here somewhere. This is Mrs. Lawson. How do you do? Pardon me. You don't speak French. How stupid of me. Huh? Oh, I beg your pardon. You don't speak Apache. Howdy. How do you do, Mrs. Sykes. Now, you come with me. I want you to meet the worst gossip in New York. You might as well get it over with. Aunt Emma has done beautifully by her. And Hubert, you're quite an actor. I'm not acting, my dear. This is lovely. There she is, my dear. The most vicious tongue in town. Really, my dear. You flatter me. I want see her. I want to see ? Woo, you got a red skin. I suppose you find our ways quite different from things on the reservation. Heap different. All time me no understand here. Of course. Oh, yes. What is it that you find strangest here? What is it that seems to trouble you most? Too much white man. Apache no like white men. Don't white man ever come onto your reservation? Come sometimes all right. Chase 'em. Catch 'em. Cut 'em heart out. What?! Cut 'em heart out. My word! Your people hate us so much? No hate 'em. Like 'em. Dislike 'em. Drike 'em? I don't think I understand. Put 'em salt on heart. Cook 'em. Eat 'em. Eat good. But you married a white man, after all. How did that happen? Him too skinny. Heart no good to eat. Tie him up. Take him home by and by. Kill him. Eat him. How much you weigh? Are you coming, Michael? She's won them all. Toughest gang in town, my boy. Care for a cigarette? No. Oh, Mrs. Carter. Oh, and this is Mr. Curzon. Oh, my dear. Mr. Cursed? That's no way to introduce the wretch. He's my nephew. And he's always given me much more trouble than my gout. Anybody can have my gout that wants it. As you can see, she's mad about you. At any rate, more so than gout. That's a grave question. He's a scoundrel and a heart breaker. There isn't a married woman in the whole of North America that's safe from him. What a buildup. You don't buy that one, do you, Mrs. Carter? Of course not. Just looking at you, any woman can tell that she's completely safe with you. Good girl! Put him in his place. That calls for a drink. Champagne. What's that? Huh? Huh? I say, uh, what did you say? I said ? Well, uh ? Well, what did I say? Well, you said, what's that? Well. What is it? Uh, wait a minute. Uh? You said "what is champagne?" No. No, I meant ? I meant, I never had any. Oh. What what's it like? Well, it's like, uh ? It's, uh ? It's like ? Well, here! It's singing! It's the song of songs. I want to see you. There's no hurry. Yes, there is. And I say there isn't. Come on, Bob. Diana, don't you know? Never take a man away from a bar. He never forgives. Or forgets. There he is now. Did you know it was me, Michael? No. I wouldn't know it. And ? You're very proud? Oh I hope proud, anyway. You look great. Am I? That sure was a great triumph. What do you mean, Michael? I mean that. I told you to where the other, didn't I? I didn't marry Miss Parrot. I married an Indian. Oh. You don't like this? I was afraid you wouldn't. It's too much. And you don't want anyone else to see so much, do you? I I'm glad you don't. I'm not shaking my head about your back. The way I lose. That's what I'm shaking my head about. I can't beat them at any turn. Any scheme I've ever had for revenge, they just blow to smithereens. They? My family. My precious family. Oh. "Oh" is right. Michael. What? What are you talking about, Michael? I'm talking about an Indian. I wanted you to come downstairs on a horse. Shooting arrows all over the room. Just as they expected you to. And I wanted my family to drop dead, I guess. Instead of that, you're the belle of the ball. Now. I can't beat them. In other words,. You wanted to disgrace your family. That was the main idea. Yes. And I came along. And fell in love with you. Because I was an Indian. Good. That's a very nice idea for revenge. Oh, maybe it wasn't so nice. Oh, but it was. I mean ? I understand. I'm sorry to disappoint you. Where are you going? Wait a minute. I don't want you to go. No? No, I don't. But I do. Would you stay if I said "I'm sorry"? Very sorry. No. If I said "I like you"? "Deeply. " Would you then? No. Tonita. If I said "I love you"? Not if you said the whole world could be mine. And every star in the sky. You see this bead? I took it out of yours. And if you ever touch me again, I'll put it back in you. Tonita, my dear. Thank you so much, Mrs. Carter? For everything you've done. It was a lovely party. I'll always remember it for years. Tonita, what in the world? There's only one thing in the world. One thing I live for. Revenge. I don't know what you mean. I mean ? What does he know about revenge? He's a white man. Just think. It would've satisfied him just to embarrass his family. What a revenge. She means, mother ? She means ? She's an Indian. Take me out of here, please. Tonita! What's it singing now? One song. Wait till it sings in your veins. You'll laugh. And do all sorts of crazy things. I think I'll laugh. It's funny. I knew I was going to like you. Just the way you came down those stairs. How did I come down the stairs? That's your secret. I want to kiss you. And learn them all. I've only one secret. I've left him. Really? For good. Oh. And I'm moving in.. I see. And she's moving out. Not a bad idea. We'll both go together. No, you won't! Diana, I thought you were the one woman in the world who had what we called dignity. I'm glad you thought so. Now you're going to think again. All my bridges are in ashes. You've got to take me back. Whether you want be or not. Well, I won't take you back. I won't be discarded, Bob. Is that clear? Of course, it's clear. This is in love. It's pride. I know the Carters. Bob! Please! Listen. I'm through, see? Why, the very sight of you bores me. Everything. The way you walk. The way you talk. The way you think. You're no good! No good. Shut up, you squaw! No good at all. Any of you. She's right. Shut up! Both of you. Come on. She's going to have a fit. And I don't stay around women with fits. No! You're right, Bob! You're not going to stay around here! You're not going to stay around. BOB! What have I done? What have I done? Oh. Save me! Save me! Save you? When you didn't love him? I don't want to die. I must've been crazy. You ought to be glad you killed him. You'll be willing to die for it. I'd gladly die to satisfy my hate. What are you staring at? I'll save you. How how can you? I shot him. No. I shot him! No! - Oh, yes! Now listen to me. It's just what I'm looking for. It couldn't be better. What do I care about living? Life's rotten. Life's rotten. Come on. We'll get a cab. You can go back to it. Connolly here spotted the guy. Just as he was making a dive for the subway. He yelled. And I grabbed him. Then I was just gonna put ? Where's the masquerade, sister? I just killed Robert Prentice. I like these swanky murders. You don't have to climb upstairs. Whew. The dame wasn't lying. No. Right between the eyes. Them Indians sure know how to drill 'em. Not a bad looking dame. Even in them rags. Call up the chief. And tell him the confession is okay. Come on out of there. Look here. Yeah. Let's go. You didn't know that your wife walked in here and confessed, Mr. Carter? No, I didn't. Why do you think she confessed? Well, I might as well tell you. Because she loved me, I guess. That's a good reason any time. Why did you do it? Well, he had it coming to him. Mmm-hmm. Okay, Connolly. Put him away for the night. Captain, can I see you? For a minute, yes. Alone, I mean. Not a chance. But, Captain, I've got to! I mean ? I mean ? Ah, Captain. Will you...? Please! I wanted to take you out front, Mrs. Carter. What for? I've told you everything. Orders. I'd advise you to come along. Oh. Listen. I'm going to get you out of this. I happened to be there when the police arrived. I made them believe that I did it. They think that you confess to save me. I fooled them completely. All you have to do is keep your mouth shut. Get me? GET ME? Michael. Well, what? What? What are you doing this for? Because I want to. Do you feel you owe it to me? Oh I just know they're not going to get you. They're not in the end. They're not going to get you. I know that. Oh, Michael. They haven't got a chance. I didn't do it, Mike. I don't want you to think I did now. You didn't? Who? Diana. Diana? She wanted to live so much. I wanted to die. And make you suffer. It was my revenge. Oh. Life wasn't worth living without you. That's all right, darling. For better, for worse. In sickness. And in health. Remember those words? Oh, Michael. Are we really together now? I was wrong. We were always together. I love you plenty. Long time. I was just no good. I was wrong too. You're plenty good. Listen to that, will you? Ain't this some invention now? It picks up the slightest sound. Yeah. Even a kiss.
