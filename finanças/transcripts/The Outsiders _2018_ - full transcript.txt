We're here to thank her. I'm getting the military instructor. All of you continue your test. Please walk slowly. Hi, do you still remember me? I'm Yu Hao. What's your name? Pei Yu-yen. Pei Yu-yen, thank you. Thanks a lot. Everyone, I'm sorry for interrupting you. I don't mean to lecture you, but you shouldn't stick up for those bad students. I didn't stick up for anyone. Military instructor, you asked me what I saw. A group of people beat up a person. -That's not right. -Ah, enough. I don't care how many people were fighting. The fact is that they were fighting. Military instructor, I was there that day. I knew what happened. Pei Yu-yen, you're a top-class student and you've involved yourself with those bottom class students. But this has nothing to do with grades. Let me ask you. Do your parents know about this? Here's the broadcasting room. Yu Hao, Shan Li-jie, Yang Hsun-chi from class 15, 3rd grade report to the Military Instructors' Office. Who's smoking? Pei Yu-yen, don't move. Keep your eyes open for me. Who? I smelled the cigarette and you dare not admit it. Where's the cigarette smell? Do you have a stuffy nose? If I find the cigarette, all of you will get a major demerit. Get out of here all of you. You're slacking at cleaning time. What the hell are you doing? You bottom class students are really the black sheep. Do you want to graduate or not? Yu-Yen, have you seen any cigarette butts? I haven't. Show me your hands. Military instructor, if there's nothing else, may I go back to pee? You have no shame. - Thank you, military instructor. - Military instructor, bye-bye. Where is it? Don't you get it? My hands won't have cigarette smell this way. Liao? What? Liao means you get it. So, do you get it? I got it. I like people who have a sense of brotherhood. Your affairs will be mine from now on. I'm Hung-dou and I'm in class 24. I've got your back. Go. 66. 63.. - 64. - 67. 69. Military instructor, school is out. It's time to go home for supper.

You have too much energy. Make sure you do a good job. How many do we have to do? Let's go. -Come over here. -Hello, military instructor. Come over here. Hello, military instructor. What's wrong with you? Do you have any idea how long your hair is? Have a haircut. And after you do it, show me your hair. You may go. Hello, sister-in-law. -If you're willing... -Childish. Sister-in-law, you are cool. I admire you. Sister-in-law, walk slowly. Bye. Let's go. Alright, get moving. Shan, let's go. Let's eat. Excuse me. Wait for me. Wait for me. What are you doing? Do you want to die? Excuse me. Get in the bus. Brother, sorry for it. Open it if you're willing to be my friend. You can just toss it if you don't want to be my friend.

What a coincidence. How come you're here? I'm waiting for the bus. I have to go to a cram school tonight. Cram school? It's not evening yet. Let's go, I'll treat you shaved ice, and introduce my boyfriend to you. There's no need. I have to go to the cram school in a while. I'm afraid I might not make it. I haven't thanked you for what you did last time. Remember? You saved my butt. -But, I... -She will come for sure. How do you know that? What you're saying has severely insulted my character and intelligence. Since when you have intelligence? Aren't we brothers? What are you saying? Shan, why the long face? Hey, how come you didn't invite me? -Hi, sister-in-law. -What sister-in-law? Don't you tease my friend, okay? Why are you so hot-tempered? What are you doing here? This is Ah-Chi. Pay no attention to him. Shan. My boyfriend, Yu Hao. Hey, who's your boyfriend? Stop talking nonsense, alright? Sister-in-law, have a seat. Watch out what you say. You keep calling her sister-in-law. The entire school knows that Hao wants to date Pei Yu-yen. Don't you know that? Excuse me. -Hey, sister-in-law. -Pei Yu-yen. -Ah, sister-in-law. -Yu Hao. -We can finally invite her. -Shup up. Was Ah-Chi telling the truth? Whatever Shan isn't saying is the truth, while whatever I say is bullshit. See. Aren't you embarrassed now? Hey, Hung-dou. Hung-dou. Hung-dou. Pei Yu-yen. You misunderstand. I'm not Hung-dou's boyfriend. I'm nobody to you. You don't need to explain to me. Hey. Are you mad at me? I don't know you. Why would I be mad at you? Pei Yu-yen. Hung-dou. -Pei Yu-yen. -Hung-dou, please. Don't cause trouble. I'll cut off your hand if you keep dragging me. Hung-dou. We're just buddies. We're really buddies. Yu Hao didn't tell me that he's going after you. I was pissed so I made trouble on purpose. -Don't misunderstand him. -Yes, please. We grew up together. Hung-dou only has boobs and has no brain. It hurts. -It's true. -You only have boobs and have no brain. Yang Hsun-chi. Take your time talking to each other. Stop beating me. I'll beat you. Do you always use this method to go after girls? I never went after any girls. You're the first. Is this your first time riding on a motorcycle? Hmm. How does it feel? The wind is really strong. What did you say? I said the wind is very... I said the wind is very strong. I see. It's alright. Sip-pat-la. Hung-dou is very nice. She just broke up. You have a chance. You think I'm stupid? Hello, sister-in-law. This is Shan, whom you have met before. The spark plugs were stuck with carbon. I've changed them. I also cleaned the carburetor. Let me give it a try. Sip-pat-la. Listen to the sound. -It's so loud. -It can't be. Yu Hao. Fuck. -What do you want now? -Hey. -What are you yelling, bitch? -Talk nice to each other. -Shut up. What did you say? -What do you want? Enough... Ah-Pao has told me what happened between you guys. We're all friends. You race against each other in the next section, it will end here no matter who wins. -That's it, okay? -I'll race against you. -Hey, Ah-Chi Who do you think you are? You can race against my bro. Do you fucking have too much gas? Give it to your mom to use for cooking. What did you say? Say it again if you have guts. Do you dare? Everything is fine. Hao. -You can do it. -Yu Hao, you can do it. Yu Hao, ride slowly. Sister-in-law, he'll lose if he rides slowly. It's boring riding alone. Why don't we go for bigger game? Do you dare to race with passengers? Bro Huo, this isn't what you said. It's only one more person. Are you worried that Yu Hao will be afraid? Or are you worried it's not okay to change motorcycles? I'm okay with a race carrying passengers. He can do it himself. Fuck this. The affairs between you three have become mine. Now what? I'll do it. It's none of your business. Get off. Get off. Do it, since the girl will ride with you. Close your eyes if you're afraid. Hao... The winner in the last group was Red Ant. Next group, get ready. Fire Fox. Ah-Huo Motorcycle Dealer. Ready... Go!

If you had listened to me and stayed at home, this wouldn't have happened. I was bored at home. -You dare to talk back? -Speaker... Don't be mad. Keep your cool. Hello, Senior. -Senior, why bother come? -Let us handle it. Keep your mouth shut. -Get out of my way. -Senior. So you're so impressive, you get into fights... -Ah-Hui. -You're incredible. Incredible Enough, what are you doing? Who are you showing off to by hitting him? Police chief, I'm Yu Hao's godfather. He's not a bad kid. He's Yu Hao's godfather. He's not a bad kid? He's not a bad kid, but he totally destroyed a store. What kind of trouble would he get into if he was really bad? Can you tell me? It's okay as long as they are fine. It's only the matter of compensation. I think we'll pay our own medical care expenses. As for the store's losses, we'll each pay half. Alright. Take care of it as soon as possible, so they can reopen their business. Yes sir. Professor Pei, let me give you a ride since your place is on the way. There's no need. I have a car. -Go home. Move. -That's not what happened. -That's not what happened. -Chief, we'll get going. -Yu Hao didn't do anything. -Good bye... He brought a group of people. More than a dozen of them attacked Yu Hao. Which one? Let me get the profile for you to identify. You don't need it. It's him. Go home. You stay here to handle it. I'm going back to the parliament. Alright. -Chief... -Yeah? Let's have some tea. Okay... Ah-Hui, let's have some tea. -Let's go...have some tea. -Okay...have some tea. -That's right. It's nothing. -The matter isn't that grave. Here...have some tea. Apologize to your parents. Do you think you have grown up? So, you don't need to listen to me? Uncle Hui, they are the unreasonable ones. It has nothing to do with Yu Hao. Uncle Hui, I started it. -Just blame me. -Do your squats. Before the matter is settled, stay in the village and don't go anywhere. The same rule applies to you two. How much do we have to pay? It's not your business. It caused the trouble, I'll take the responsibility. Take responsibility? I'll take responsibility too. We'll take it together. What are you doing? You'll take responsibility? How much money do you make a month? Responsibility? I'll shoulder the burden it no matter how much money it is. You'll shoulder the burden? -I'll show you. -Uncle Hui. -We are at fault too, Uncle Hui. -Let go. -Beat us, we are in this too. -Let go. Brother, sister-in-law, I have neglected my duty. It's my negligence. I haven't taught him correctly. I'm sorry. As for street racing, I'll deal with you later. Hao. Hao. Hao. Leave him alone for a while. "Honor and disgrace" Thank you for your help, principal. You're welcome. Yu-yen wants to study in the U.S. the school will do its utmost to help her. This is her graduation certificate. Thank you. Testing... One, two, three... Okay. Thanks. Hello, everyone. I'm Yu Hao from class 15, third grade. For some reasons, I won't be able to take part in the graduation ceremony. Hurry. So I would like to deliver my graduation reflections here to you. During the last three years in high school, we've worn the same uniform, carried the same kind of backpack, and had the same hair style. However, we are divided into different classes. Who is it? The school labels us with grades to determine whether we have prospects in the future Damn bottom class students! I don't know whether I'm doing this right or not. But I want to say that examinations don't represent my life. My life doesn't have the standard answers you want. Cool. The military instructor is here. Open the door. I said open the door. -Open the door. -Hurry. I open the door. Get ready to be expelled. What are you doing? You had to write a repentant letter. Open the door. Don't run. What are you doing? We gotta go. Someone else has contracted waste soil disposal years ago. And you bring it up now? Are you nuts? Contact me sooner next time. Here's your dish. Hurry and send my tea over. The compensation is 120 million dollars. Split it into two, and you pay 600,000 dollars and I pay 600,000 dollars. The problem is your godfather, who has done everything except selling his blood, only gave me this amount. It's only 300,000 dollars. What does it mean? How about the remaining 300,000 dollars? Are you going to repay me or your godfather, or your godfather's supervisor? Give me some time, I'll try to repay you. We'll repay you together. I can repay you with my dad's Farmland Grants certificate. Very good. You three are just like me when I was young. I don't want to see you heading the wrong way. Hey. we're running out of options. Let's see it as part-time job. What do you think? Should we ask Uncle Hui? Are you stupid? Do you want to be beaten up? You caused this. Who is stupid? -He's playing Alchemy. It's right to beat him up. -You shouldn't be so impulsive. Enough. I'm serious. Let me go alone. Hey, what are you talking about? Your affairs are our affairs. Where did you go? Fuck. Do we have to report to you about hitting on a girl? My sister has run away from home. Which one of you can take her in? Me. Sister-in-law can stay at my house. -Why are you here? -It's not your business. -Is it because what happened at the MTV? -You already know it. Idiot. Why are you so hot-tempered? -Sister-in-law said anything? -She did. But I don't want to tell you. Ah-Chi gave me these. Wait for me. I'm the only person in my house. You can stay here as long as you want. Come. We go to the living room. We go to the living room. Are you hungry? Do you want to eat something? It's okay. I have eaten at Hung-dou's house. You've eaten? Was it noodles with soybean paste? How do you know? I've had that all the time since I was young. Thank you. Yu Hao. Pei Yu-yen has run away from her home. You better have nothing to do with it... -Uncle Hui, Pei Yu-yen's dad wants to... -Shut up. You have been accused of damaging property and assault. You want to be accused of abduction as well? Uncle Hui. Don't blame Yu Hao. I came to look for him myself. Your dad has called the police. Go home. I'm 18. So, you're an adult? Okay, let me reason with you. I have two choices for you. One, I'll call your family come and get you. Two, I'll take you home now. Pick one. Uncle Hui, her dad wants her to go to U.S. but she... Shut up. Have you made a decision yet? I'll go home, but I hope you can accompany me. You stay here. Uncle Hui, my dad wants me go to the U.S. the day after tomorrow. Congratulations. Write to Hao and encourage him when you have time. But I don't want to go. Then I ran away from home. If you want me to leave, I'll leave, but I won't go home. You... Are you threatening me? I'm begging you, Uncle Hui. Yu Hao didn't abduct me. I made my own decision. What are you thinking? Do you know how many people envy you for being able to study in the U.S.? I would send Hao over there if I was able. But your ideas aren't necessarily good. Uncle Hui, I really don't want to go to the U.S. I beg you. Go home. Get into the car. Get into the car. I don't want to say it again. Dad, I don't want to go to Philadelphia. I don't want to study accounting either. Dad, I beg you. Don't force me. I don't want to do things that I don't want to do. Please let me be myself, alright? Fine. I wish you were never born. Uncle Hui, I have no home to go back now. Do you still want to chase me away? I'm not chasing you away. You guys are still young. Love comes and disappears fast. I don't want you to regret later. Uncle Hui, since I was young, I have been living under my father's rules. I wake up and go to bed at certain time. I study and eat at certain time. And I should and shouldn't do certain things. Everything is clear-cut. I thought everyone lives the same life, until I met Yu Hao. Thank you for thinking highly of Yu Hao. But I have to tell you the truth. You're from different worlds. You won't have a happy ending if you are together. Uncle Hui, the reason why I like Yu Hao isn't because he's handsome, nor because he makes me laugh. It's because he makes me more brave and complete. No matter what happens in the future, I won't regret it, because this is my decision. My name card is under the glass top of the coffee table. Call me if you need me. I'm sorry. My fried egg is burned. Here. Thank you. We used to have a lot of chili plants. Whether Hung-dou's family wanted to make noodles with soybean paste or the neighbor Mrs. Chang wanted to make stewed beef, they all came to my house to pick chilis. We made peeled chili if we couldn't use them up. After my parents died, no one took care of our chili plants, and they died. The peeled chili was made by Ah-Chi's mom. Ah-Chi's house is the grocery store at alley's entrance. If you want anything, go over to get them. I'll pay Ah-Chi later. May I have a taste? Sure. Here. What do you think? Is it spicy? It's very spicy, isn't it? Let me get you some water. One, two, one, two, one, two. Spirit call. Did you go through the clothes when you donated them? Could you not be so indiscriminate? Some aren't the right size and some styles are too old. Shut up. Don't bring them out to embarrass yourselves, alright? This one is pretty nice. What is this? Sister-in-law, please don't bring out your favorite clothes, alright? Fuck. Sister-in-law is refined girl. Who is going to wear these indecent shorts? Did you say indecent? Stop doing it. Just eat your deep-fried sweet potato. Stop talking nonsense. -Alright. -Come back here. These are from my friends. If you don't mind that they are used, go ahead and pick whatever you like. Thank you. This one is no good. It doesn't suit you. Wait for a second. I need to return a phone call. That one is really no good. Alright, Bro Kui, I know. I'll take care of it. I have accepted a job. My boss assigned it to me. What job? Hm... Security management. What is security management? Security management is... similar to what a patrol team does. Shan, Ah-Chi and I will work together. Where's the location? May I go and take a look? Yu Hao, come here. Bro Kui. Toast to Bro Lung. Lung, this young man is awesome. He's exceptional. You must treat him well. That's Yu Hao's girlfriend. So what? -I can't touch her? -I didn't say that, Bro Pao. But he's with Bro Kui now. Bro Kui. -Yes. -Fuck, Bro Kui is my dad's underling. If I want to do something today, he wouldn't dare to do anything to me. Get it? Yes... I know. I'm sorry... Bro Pao. Bro Pao, I'm sorry. Shan, I'm heading out now. Bro Hao, something happened in a private room. Sister-in-law, good bye. I'll check on it. Everything is fine. You go home first. Shan, please take Yen home for me. Be careful. Let me take you home. Excuse me. Excuse me. Look up there. Some people are fighting. Stop fighting. Let me take you home. Go and help him. I can go home myself. Shan. Yu Hao told me to take you home. Didn't I tell you there's no need? As long as you have arrived safely. I'm leaving now. Is he a member of the mob? He isn't. How can you say he isn't when he's with them all day long? Who would believe it? I believe it. Ah-Chi believes it. Friends who know Yu Hao believe it. I'm going now, sister-in-law. With your background, you can have any girl you want. But you keep close watch over this girl. Don't you think it's too disconcerting? It's because she's Yu Hao's woman. I'm pissed. Bro Kui, are you going to help me? Your dad will be so pissed if he finds out. We won't let him know. Anyway, this isn't our first time doing this, is it? Uncle. How come you aren't in bed yet? The dance hall is too dark. I fell accidentally. I'm fine. It's only a small injury. Be careful next time. You smell of cigarettes. Don't smoke so much. Good night. Good morning. You are up? Get ready for breakfast. Wait a second. We'll start our part-time job on June 10 and finish it on September 10, I'll find a steady job after that. You'll concentrate on your study for the national exam during this period. Have a seat. Is your dance hall still looking for workers? I would like to work part-time there. That place isn't right for you. Don't hold a grudge against me. I'll do what I promised you. I'm not holding a grudge against you. You have done enough for me. It's my turn to help you now. We can work hard together repaying the money, and then start anew. -But... -Eat your breakfast. -But that place... -I'll go freshen up. Hey. Deliver some wine to table three. Thank you. I think you shouldn't have allowed her to come here. I know, but she insisted on it. Don't worry, I'll protect her. Let me tell you something. I haven't smoked for a week. Very good. Keep it up. Then... Can I have a kiss? No way. Why? What why? There's no why. You don't get one, that's it. No reward for me at all? Then close your eyes. Alright. "Remember the warm stary night Remember your pretty face" "Remember you hold my hands in silence" "We can care less about the world" You fooled me again? I didn't fool you. I did kiss you. -You didn't. -Don't come close to me. Sister Ah-fen, is my order ready yet? It's about ready. I would like to add some vegetables. Vegetables? See what you want. Hm... Yen. Thank you, auntie. Excuse me. What do you think you're doing here? Do you think it's cool to be gangsters? See if I'll arrest you all. I'll arrest you. Uncle Hui. Ah, mister, please. If you want to educate your kids, do it at your home. That's right. This is a police spot check. Show me your IDs. Hurry. Hurry. -Where are you going? -Hao. Where are you going? -Uncle Hui. -Go away. What are you doing here? Uncle Hui; it's our working hours right now. We'll talk when we're home, alright? Yen, do you have any idea what you're doing? Uncle Hui, I believe in Yu Hao. Why can't you believe him? All of you, listen, I'll come and arrest you if you dare to become gangsters. Hao. Hao. Yu Hao, our new nightclub doesn't have enough workers. You go over there to watch over it for me, making sure it gets on track as soon as possible. You can ask Shan and Ah-Chi to go with you. Or you can find some other people. Make sure those people can fight, better than it. Bro Kui, this isn't what we agreed on. Please find someone else. I'm giving you a chance and training you. Don't you get it? Do you think I don't have helpers? Is it because we haven't discussed money and you can't explain it to your brother? -It's simple. -It's not the issue of money. I have promised my girlfriend. My promise is more important than money. I hope Bro Kui can remember our earlier agreement. The cigarette is stinky. Bro Kui, you should smoke less. I'm leaving now. Bro Kui, your car is ready. -Here. Good... -Thank you. What? What are you doing? Bro Kui, are you alright? Let him go. What's going on now? Do you think you're a top dog because being a policeman? I'm not a police now. I'm talking to you as Yu Hao's dad. Listen carefully, from now on, as long as Yu Hao is working for your store, I'll keep giving you trouble until you're on the run. If you weren't a policeman, I would have killed you long ago. Do you believe it? I can transfer you to a coastal spot where you will be blown by the sea breeze forever? You can try. Let's see who will die first. I'm sorry. This door is hard to open. Sorry about that. -Thank you. It's your turn now. -Okay. -I'm sorry. I forgot to get... -Ah? I forget to get my clothes.

This piano hasn't been played for a long time. We don't know if it is still in tune. You can give it a try. Yen, listen, Shan decided to do his military service early. He was assigned to an offshore island. We won't be able to see him for a long time. He said that we can write to him. But he can't guarantee he will write back. By the way, I would like to learn how to play piano. Can you teach me? Then...I'll get going. Take a rest. I'm going home now. -Take care of her. -Thank you.

"14 years later" Shan Li-jie, do you know how long I have been looking for you? Yes, I'm stupid. I care about whether you have enough to eat. I care about whether you're doing alright. You have been out more than a year, and you've never called me. What kind of brotherhood is this? Fuck. I wouldn't have known where you were if someone hadn't told me you're here. Bro, I have missed you so much. Today, you won't be able to run. -Auntie. -Hi. -Long time no see. -You have grown up. Don't I look sharp? Today is Hung-dou's and my wedding day. Bro Shan. Bro Shan.

What's going on with the tables? They are not placed properly. Why are the tables so empty? My god. Where are the people? Shan. Shan. Shan. Shan. Shan. Where did you disappear to? How come you're still so handsome? Bride, please. Control yourself, alright? I'm more handsome. I'm more handsome today, alright? Alright. You're unbearably handsome today. Shan, let's go.

Shan is back, and Hung-dou and Ah-Chi are getting married. When Uncle Hui is back, we will be together again. You must remember to bless all of us to be safe and healthy. By the way, Ah-Chi, Hung-dou, and I opened a company. We have made some money over the last few years. We gave part of money to Uncle Shan for living expenses, and saved the rest for you. I thought first they stole it, and found out later that they really borrowed it. What an idiot. He still couldn't tell the difference between an organ and a piano. You must drink some wine for Ah-Chi and don't let him get drunk. Yen, do you still... play piano? I haven't for a long time. Shan. Shan. Shan. Shan, let's go. Hurry. Okay, slow down. Hurry. Wait for me. Whoever loses has to treat the rest to shaved ice.
