[dramatic music playing] Hey, Caruso. What? I'm already clocked out. Leavin' a bit early, are we? [static] Bite me, Johnston. Why don't you just worry about yourself? If you forget to clock out on time, the boss is going to chew your ass out. How else am I supposed to get that sweet, sweet overtime? Yeah, yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. Big day and all. [static] 'Night, Caruso. [static] Hey, Caruso? [typing] What the hell? Where did this come from? [grunts and groans] [beeps; unlocks] [beeps] [♪♪♪] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on today's inaugural ride on the N800A Tiburon. - MAN: What? - WOMAN: Get off your phone. - Yee. - You're on it all day. I can't help it. You see any Wi-Fi this strong... Thank you so much for joining us on today's inaugural ride on the N800A Tiburon. We are now boarding all passengers. [indistinct chatter] You have only, like, a hundred followers. It doesn't even matter. Look how much my portfolio is worth. You see this? - Are you sure this is right? - Oh, my God. - Yes. - Are you just saying that? Dude, everybody's going the same way. Why do you have to make everything so difficult? I'm looking forward to being on a bullet train for the first time. I don't want to miss the inaugural ride. - Our trips to mom... - Hey. That's Jack Banta. [indistinct chatter] The guy in the suit? Mm-hmm. I'm gonna get a photo. No. Come on, it's almost final boarding. Only take a second, okay? I don't want to miss the train, either. Davey. [girl laughs] - I swear to God. Sorry, that's far enough, guys. Oh, you-you work for him... Jack Banta? Me and about a hundred thousand other people, buddy. Least he didn't spend it all on a megayacht. Say megayacht. Megayacht. [click] Nice. Got to post that. Thank you for tuning in. This is Joyce speaking. And I'm with the legendary Jack Banta. Jack, today is such a special day. Tell us how all of this happened. So, levitation, or more precisely, electrodynamic suspension, is possible with electromagnets. Now, those are coils of superconductive wire that are cooled to cryogenic temperatures. And that repels the passive field of the rail. [ding-dong] - Final boarding for the N800A Tiburon northbound of San Francisco. - All passengers... - Hey, I told you. Come on. And repel... - Hurry. - We'll be fine. - ...rail. - Wow. Absolutely fascinating, Jack. I want to hear more. It is fascinating, but it gets better. This is more reliable than traditional rail. Less friction. Less maintenance and crew to keep it running. And a lot more automation. But those are just bonuses. What we're really doing is using the latest technology to better the lives of regular people, and they have more time to decompress without the stress of driving. Isn't that right, Lou? - Right, right, right. - Hmm, right. - So there you have it. - Heh. Good morning. Dude, get off your phone. I'm just telling you. You see how many people... - Good morning, ma'am. - Hi. - Sir. - Hello. - Davey. - Morning. I want the aisle. Whatever. - So? - You're so annoying. You're so stupid. Mm-hmm. [ding] - How are you, sir? - Hi. - Thanks for joining us. Well... [fastens seat belt] - I guess this is me. [dinging] WOMAN: Thank you for choosing Pacific High Speed Rail, your safe and hassle-free travel partner. The train will be departing shortly. [dinging] [indistinct chatter] You know Stephen Crane was only 24 years old when he wrote that book? - What's that? - I didn't mean to bother you. I was just saying... you're reading a classic. Oh, yeah. - I teach high school. - Ah. I like to refresh my memory every year. I don't want to forget anything. Oh, good for you. Yeah. They say the human brain forgets about 80%. That's why I prefer to work in digital storage. Oh, so you're a computer guy. Yeah. I work at a tech start-up in Alameda. [click] - Ha ha ha ha ha. Okay, tag me in that one. I won't. I'm not. Yeah. [overlapping chatter] Cloud computing. It's boring. It's got nothing to do with trains, per se. - But this is historic, isn't it? - Yeah, it's cool. As soon as they made these seats available, I just knew I had to be one of the first hundred and 40 on board. This is a monumental day in the history of transportation. I mean, I'm sure you're excited, right? Oh, yeah. I get to tell my students I was on the first bullet train in America. Yeah. Moving forward, it's gonna be nice to get on a train, read a book for a couple hours, and hop off in San Francisco. Oh, man, I wish I could just read for a living. There's a little bit more to it than that. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean, like, that's all that you do, - of course. - That's okay. Yeah. It's all good. I'm Kessler, by the way. - Frank. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. Yeah. Enjoy your ride. You too. Yeah. MALE VOICE: Our doors are closing. As you know, they told me it couldn't be done. And as always, I proved them wrong. It's a great day for California, and hopefully for the nation. [dinging] The N800A Tiburon northbound to San Francisco is now departing the station. Estimated time of travel is 95 minutes. [dinging] Well, we better get going. Be sure to lead with the fact that this is going to transform society and improve people's lives, yes? You got it. If there's anything else you need, anything you'd like to cover, please call me. - All right. You ready? - Let's go. - Okay. - Thank you again. My pleasure. Enjoy the ride. Thank you. - Hello, Mr. Banta. - Hello. - Nice to see you again, Lou. - Good morning, Holly. It's good to have you as our engineer on the inaugural ride, Holly. Jack, let's get a photo of you with engineer for social. Good idea. [click] - Beautiful. Make the caption "Great Day For The Future Of America." [beep; train powers up] N800A Tiburon to Control, do you read me? Loud and clear, Tiburon. We're seeing an issue with the hatch the underside of the train in your compartment 1A. Can you have a look? Over. Checking it now. [beeping] Confirm status. Affirmative. Issue resolved. All systems operational. What was the problem? As you said, the hatch was not closed. Interesting. Our records show the hatch was closed during last night's inspection. Could an inspector have left the hatch undone? I suspect it broke open with the pressure change as I entered the car this morning. Okay. Well, I'll check in with our inspectors. You are all cleared. Clearance to depart as scheduled. [dinging] WOMAN: The train is departing. Please keep clear of the doors. Thank you for choosing Pacific High Speed Rail, your safe and hassle-free travel partner. The N800A Tiburon northbound to San Francisco is now departing the station. Estimated time of travel is 95 minutes. [murmuring] [ding] [overlapping chatter] [dinging] Ladies and gentlemen, this is Jack Banta. I'd like to personally thank you for joining us on the inaugural ride. This technology is California's future. And that future starts today. [dinging] That was great. Thank you. Whoa-ho-ho. Triple digits. That's nothing. I read it goes up to, like, 300 miles an hour. Ho ho. Three hundo, baby. Let's go. Ha ha ha. [clears throat] Hey, you okay? - Lookin' kind of pale. - Yeah. I've got an open bottle of water, if you need it. No, no, no, no. It's fine. It's just, uh... I didn't expect the speed to affect me this way. You sure? You look really sick. No. Thank you, though. Yeah. [clears throat] Hey, you... really sweating, man. I... You know what? Excuse me for a second. "One ninety-five." Two hundred. Oh, my God. - It's so smooth. - Right? You can't even feel it. Joyce Nowak, L.A. Times. Can I take a photo? - Sure. - It's for an article. Of course. [click] - Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Unh. Sir, departure scan. New train, same regulations. - Dude. - So cool. Yeah. We're gettin' good feedback about the Tiburon. - Hmm. - Trendin' on Twitter. Not number one? Let me see. If we had a better caption... Caption is fine. Pocket square might be the problem. [cell phone rings] - Here. [ringing] - Unlisted. - Ignore it. - It's probably just another reporter, right? I'll do another interview. Why not? I can talk about super-conducting magnets all day. - Hello. - [distorted] Jack Banta. - Yes. - Congratulations, sir. Two hundred and 50 tons, 24,000 horsepower. Full speed in under three minutes. It's all very impressive. How did you do it? - Thank you. I... - You made it all look easy. May I ask who I'm talking to? This connection's not very good. I can't quite make out your voice. And all things considered, it's a shame. - What is? - The bomb. Okay. [hangs up] What was that? Some joker. [cell phone ringing] Unlisted number. Don't answer it. [ringing] Give me Jack Banta. It's for you. Have OCC trace the call. On it. [boing] Trace the call from the emergency phone? [typing] Ahem. Listen, psycho. Finding my number is hard, but not impossible. The interesting thing is that I can trace you. Then you should listen very carefully. There is a powerful explosive device integrated into the train's power system. Eighteen megawatts. If any part of the train dips below 200 miles per hour, the train will explode. Who are you? What do you want? Is this blackmail? One hundred million dollars paid in crypto, transferred to my wallet address. You're serious. I can't just... Jack Banta, the billionaire railroad mogul, can't afford a measly hundred mil? It's not like that. The money's tied up. But if you know me, you know how I do business. Let's make a deal. You don't want to do this. This isn't a negotiation. Well, how do I know you're telling the truth? Why should I believe you? I need something more. I thought you might doubt me. You know, you really shouldn't. We checked three times. Our sensors did not pick up any bomb. How about I show you what your sensors are missing? What are you saying? Listen very carefully. Everyone in car six will be dead in 60 seconds. Now you listen to me. [beep; dial tone] Damn it. [beeping] - Unable to triangulate? He's obscured the signal. [dinging] Uh, everyone in cars five and six must evacuate now. You have to evacuate cars five and six right now. Get down to the next car. Everyone in cars five and six must evacuate immediately. Move to the next car now. [murmuring] Now. They're not movin'. Can they hear it? Is this working? Everyone in cars five and six evacuate now. [beeping] Hurry! Take cover! [beep; explosion] [passengers screaming] - Unh. - MAN: Oh, my God. [screaming] - What was that? What happened? - My knee. - What can I do? My knee. [beeping] [grunts and moans] My knee. I can't even bend it. [coughs] - Is that smoke? - Wha... [beeping] [screaming] - Uh... - Oh, my God. [muffled screaming and yelling] [helicopter hovering and battle noises] [heart beating rapidly] [explosion] Whoa. Hey, are you okay? Hey. Please help us. [steady heartbeat] WOMAN: Please remain seated. We will be heading... We need to tape that window. Right. Actually, I might have some duct tape in my bag. Yeah. Um... this help? Great. [screaming] All right, all right. Aah. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Okay. All right, let's get away from the window. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go. Don't touch the throttle. It's too dangerous. We need to stop and assess the train. - It's critical. - Do what I say and don't go below 200. [beeping] It's Operation Center Control. - Don't say anything. - They're gonna tell us to stop. I know what the protocols are, but if we stop, we all die. [beeping continues] Copy that. What should I say? Just lie. Control for N800A Tiburon. Status report. There has been an attack. Car six is gone. Immediately stop the train, wait for authorities to arrive. Stay inside the train unless told otherwise. Copy that. - All right. Okay. - I'll take the window. - Okay. - Here take a seat. Let me look at that. Let me look at that. This is gonna hurt. Okay? She's tough. - Aah! - Oh, God. You're okay. You're okay. Mom is gonna freak out when she sees your arm. I need you to keep pressure on this okay? - Okay. - All right. All right. - W-What happened? - The window broke back there, - and it cut me. - Was there an explosion? It kind of sounded like a bomb. Hey, we don't know anything yet, all right? - Let's not jump to conclusions. - Did you hear that announcement? Clearly there's something wrong on this train. - What do you mean? - Look no need to freak out. Look, panicking doesn't do anything for anybody. I'm sure it was a... problem with an exploding power conduit. Banta did say there was an emergency up there. Look, the train's still moving, right? I'm sure we're past the worst of it. We would've stopped if it was something serious. Oh, I am out of my element here. Are you feeling okay? Yeah. Um, yeah, I'm good. Review the security footage of the train. - Anything suspicious. - I'll pull it up. The live feed is on the main screen. [beeping] - Sir, car five. Yeah, I see it. Smoke, no fire. Potentially low oxygen. Keep an eye on the sensors. The ventilation system doesn't self-correct in the next minute, we need to move those passengers to the next car. Understood. Okay, you need to find out who sent that text. Use the facial recognition. Make sure every passenger is ticketed. I'm on it. I'm gonna call Scott Madison at the FBI. He's got to be runnin' it by now. He's the Executive Assistant Director - of National Security. - Good. When's the last time you spoke? He's an old friend. You think he'll answer? Everyone answers when I call. [line ringing] Jack, we just heard from OCC there was an explosion on the train. - Are there injuries? - We don't know. We're checking the video feed, but we were attacked. All right, look. Walk me through it. A man threatened to destroy the train if we go below 200 miles an hour. To prove he was serious, he blew up car six. The explosion must've destroyed the coupling instantly. I've already put out feelers with the other agencies. We'll see if they have any leads. He demanded that I transfer a hundred million dollars in an untraceable cryptocurrency. No. Paying the attacker is not how you handle this. Under no circumstances do you pay the guy, ever. Lewis, give me eyes on Jack Banta's bullet train from Los Angeles. Strong possibility there's another explosive device. - Copy that. - Get on it. [beeping] Car five... Complete failure of ventilation. It's cycling bad air. So look, are you familiar with the perpetrator? Do you have his number? Can you call him back? No name, no number. He was using a voice modulator. All right. We'll work to track him from your phone records. Now, Jack, do you have reason to believe him? I mean, the threat... Is it credible? He already blew up one car. I have to believe he can do it again. And we had an issue with the security guard last night. What issue? I didn't want to bother you with it, but I was told a guard left without clocking out. I... thought it was nothing at the time, but I have to believe that it's connected now. - You should look into it. - All right. Acknowledged. We'll check the security footage and run background on the guards, but first, I'll call the Air Force to scramble jets immediately. What good is that gonna do? We need to save these people now. [beeping] Sir, Central Control again. I'm a little busy right now, Holly. Saving these people is the only priority. We're gonna save as many as we can. We need to secure the airspace, and we need visuals. My team is coordinating satellites to get a live image of the train. We have to save everyone. Our primary focus is getting you and the other passengers off the train safely. We'll send choppers for the passengers once the jets have visuals. One step at a time. The passengers are the only focus. I'll call you back when we have established the visuals. Take care of yourself. We'll figure this out. [hangs up] Coordinate with the Air Force and scramble jets, probably towards anything north of the train's coordinates. And choppers... Apaches, Osprey. - Anything fast ASAP. - Yes, sir. Contact emergency services in San Francisco. We'll need immediate evacuation blocks around the station. We need to find who's behind this. Work with the phone company to track the source of Jack Banta's most recent incoming call. Monitor social media for anything relevant. Copy that. And we need to run preliminary background checks. Provide me with the manifest and staff list fast. I pulled it up on console "A." Good. We need as many eyes on this as we can get. MAN: Sir, Apaches are en route while jets are being scrambled. Hey. I'm gonna go to the back of the train to see if anybody needs help. Frank, I need you to check under the seats for anything suspicious. In case I'm wrong about the power conduit. Oh, shit. [unlatches belt] [console beeps] Sir, it's Central Control again. Answer it. - Anybody hurt? - WOMAN: No, no. We're fine. Anyone need help? Everyone okay? [man, indistinct] Control for N800A Tiburon. Why haven't you stopped the train? You know what? Never mind. Control, Jack Banta. We're aware of the situation in five. The ventilation system is self-correcting. - Give it time. - Negative. The system has completely failed. Evacuate immediately and stop the train. All right. We're on top of it. [beeping] Passengers in car five... Pa... Shit. Internal come are shot. [beeping] Anyone need help? That car is filled with smoke. Why aren't they moving? We got to get them out of there. Wait, wait, wait. I-I don't think we'll need to. - Anyone hurt? - No, no. We're fine. Anybody need help? Everyone okay? Does anyone require medical attention? [screaming] - GIRL: Thank God. You have to help them in-in the next car. They can't get out. The car smells of smoke. [screaming] - Hey, what happened? It's reinforced glass. I can't break it. It's stuck. Here. Stand back. [hisses] [screaming continues] [coughs] What are they doing? They're gonna slow us down. Aces Henry, six-four-point-one, push back. Clear the airspace. Push back. Damn it. That news chopper just boned us. The train is going too fast to catch up now. Damn it. The Apaches... they're out. They lost too much ground. The top speed is barely 230. There's no way they're gonna catch up. Why isn't the airspace clear? - What are those jets doin'? - I don't know. This damn news chopper ran interference on the Apaches. MAN: Sir, jets and an Osprey are in the air. - ETA... 13 minutes. - It's the news crews. They're desperate for information. Some of the passengers have posted on social media - about the explosions. - Make sure we clear them out. We can't have another problem when the Osprey arrives. I don't think that's gonna be an issue. There's no news helicopter in the country that can keep up at these speeds. We'll see. Lift up. Come on. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Let's go. Let's go. All right. Come on. Get out of here. Who is that guy? Let me see. His name is Kessler Briggs. - Mr. Banta... - One second. [dials phone] Scott, yeah. I have a priority name for you. - Okay. - Kessler Briggs. You suspect he's the guy? No. Well, I don't know. He's walking into danger and saving people, so... Understood. Gimme a minute to run background. I'll call you back. All right. Mr. Banta, I have my concerns about maintaining this speed. There are tunnels up ahead. - So? - The train creates drag as it pushes the air in front of it aside, right? In a tunnel, the air can't go sideways, so it has to be pushed forward. We'll have to ramp up the power to maintain this speed. - It's more strain on the system. - The more we push it, the more likely components will overheat, and we're already riding a little hot. That means the magnets are misaligned. All right, keep an eye on it, but keep pushing, and don't even approach 200. Copy that. I can't just sit here and watch everything I've worked for - crumble to pieces. - Jack, what are you doin'? What I should've done from the beginning... [line ringing] - solving this with money. [women screaming] - Come on. You got it. WOMAN: Don't leave me here. MAN: She needs help. [grunts and coughs] [coughs] [no audio] - Are you guys okay? - She needs help. Uhh, it's my knee. - Okay. Come on, let's go. - I heard something snap. All right, be careful. [Joyce coughs] [Joyce screaming] - It's all right. - Aah! - Carefully. Careful. You guys saved my life. What are your names? Um, I'd rather stay out of the media, if it's all the same. Fair enough. Why are we still going? Why haven't we stopped yet? I don't know. I'm about to find out. - Go ahead, Scott. - That name you gave us? Yeah, Kessler Briggs. He's an explosives expert, an Army vet. First Lieutenant, 720th EOD company. Army discharge due to PTSD. He had an incident in... Sheberghan, but checks out. His bomb-defusing skills could be useful, if we locate the device. What was the incident? Unintentional death to friendly personnel. Friendly fire? Faulty intelligence led to tragedy. One soldier was able to get out alive thanks to Kessler. He was awarded a Silver Star. Lou, bring him here. We won't have to wait long. He's already headed this way. [bing] [girl, indistinct] [whispers, indistinct] Hey, what's going on? We have to stop this train. [beeping] - Hey, look. I know. I saw the aftermath. I need to talk to Jack Banta. Come inside. [door closes] [indistinct chatter] - Can I take a look at that? - Yeah. We're going viral. [indistinct chatter] [ding] [reads] Hey, people are hurt. The last car is completely gone. You need to stop this train. I... We can't. The most important thing was getting the people off of car 5. Now we're exploring different solutions. [ding] One hour. [ding] - Mr. Briggs, Scott Madison, FBI. We're aware of your military background. - We need your help. - To what? What's happening? Those details are on a need-to-know basis. Don't the passengers have a right to know? Jack, we need to trust him. Look, if our lives are in danger, I want to know. Is there a problem with the electrical? No. The explosion originated from the small explosive device placed in the coupling between cars five and six detonating. Took out some intercoms, but all other electrical is stable for now. It's a warning shot. What kind of warning shot kills people? You're fortunate the rest of the train, headed on forward momentum, could neutralize the rest of the blast. Next time, it won't be just one car. What? If the train drops below 200 miles per hour, a larger payload will detonate. We can't stop. Who would do this? We don't know. We're looking into it. But you believe he has more explosives? He already blew up one train car. We have to believe he'll blow up the rest if we go below 200. Not only that, but the attacker guaranteed to disarm the bomb condition upon the transfer of $100 million in untraceable cryptocurrency, all but confirm there is another bomb on board. No, I think he was lying about that. Jack. I already paid him, but he responded with, "It was never about the money." Jack, you had specific orders to pay him under no circumstances. Well, I couldn't just sit here and watch people die. I may have originally developed this technology for the government, but I don't work for you. No, but you need my help, and now you funded organized crime. These people and their families are set up for life. Look, I don't know what he wants, but we can find the bomb and disarm it. We have to. We only have about an hour to San Francisco. He's right. We don't have time to wait. We're already having a difficult time staying smooth on the tracks. If this train gets clipped by the tunnel wall... We're dead. We'll have live visual of the established in minutes, but I need confirmation there's not a device inside. You've walked through the cars. Did you see anything suspicious? No. Maybe it's in someone's luggage? But if it's in a suitcase, then it won't be able to be integrated into the train's GPS system. And the GPS won't be reliable enough. One drop in service, the whole thing's gonna blow. Our baggage stand uses advanced image recognition. They wouldn't be able to get it through. Someone got the first bomb through. But where else could they hide it? Hey, I found it. It's right underneath us. There's a crawlspace underneath the lead car. The hatch was open when I arrived this morning. I need full disclosure. Why am I hearing about this now? I thought it was an oversight. Assume nothing. Here. It's a tight squeeze. Not a lot of room to maneuver. [opens hatch] I'll do it. You sure? Clock's ticking. I have to try. Good luck. Yeah. Keep us posted. You really did save my life. Thank you. I want to see that. - Ow. - Oh, ho ho. Don't touch it. HOLLY: He's using the under body maintenance beam to support himself. He's getting closer. [train suddenly accelerates] That's the magnetic disalignment. [alarm beeping] - The impact made it worse. - We're up to point six percent. - The higher it goes, the more likely we're gonna derail. Damn. [beeping] He's gotten to the bomb. [cell phone ringing] Son of a bitch. It's him. Hello. Every collision's Russian roulette. Then disable the bomb before it detonates. [chuckles] I already paid you! [disconnects] He hung up. Come on, come on. [pulsing] We have to do everything in our power to keep this train straight on the tracks. He did it. You okay? Did you see anything? Anything? What the hell, Kessler? Is this the bomb? It's not a bomb. It's a prototype. A decoy. I use 'em all the time in the OD school back in Virginia. It's a closed-circuit without any real explosives. Person we're looking for has a military background. From the insignia... this is someone who trained at Fort Lee. Why would someone plant that underneath the train? He's been hiding his identity. Why would he leave a clue? Ah, maybe he has a reference, then he stashed it underneath. Look, there's definitely another bomb on this train. Where's the FBI? You said they're coming? Fifty minutes. Fifty minutes until we run out of track. They need to know about this. MAN: Rushmore, visual on the train, 12:00. Copy, 12:00. Transmitting video feed now. Over. The F-16s have rendezvoused with the train. I have a live feed up here if you want to see it. - Okay, show me. - Here we go. There has to be some indication. [keyboard clacking] Let me run a comparative scan to the 3-D model submitted by the patent office. It's just gonna be a second. Gimme a second. Lori 11, confirm a second object on the roof. Confirming visual. What is that? [static] One more discrepancy found. - It's on the roof. - That doesn't look right. Magnify it. [beeping] I still can't make it out. Train's moving too fast to get a clear image. Hey, get Jack on the phone. Jack, we've been reviewing a-a live feed of the train. There's an object of interest on top of that roof. The train's moving too fast to get a clear view. Well, we found something, too. - A decoy. - How do you know it's a decoy? It's a dummy with a flashing light, and on the back, there's an insignia of a longhorn skull. That unit comes from Fort Lee. We'll take a picture of it and send it to you now. [click] Did you get it? Our team will analyze the photo. Hey, what's the plan? I can climb up and out right here. There's a ladder. No, negative. Do not approach the device. We can't put passengers in more danger without knowing what we're getting into. When the Osprey arrives, they should be able to rappel down and attach a rescue ladder. But Jack's right. We can't just sit and wait. No one's giving up. We're calculating and mitigating risk. Jack, help me out here. Yeah, he's right, Kessler. We got to listen to the experts. We can't screw this up. It's too dangerous to go on top of a train at these speeds. The Osprey will be there soon. All right. We'll keep searching inside. What's your plan to get the passengers onto the Osprey? They'll extend a tether. Passengers will be raised into the Osprey with a pneumatic lift. I'll prepare the passengers. [door opens] What's going on? Can't talk about that. Oh, my God. I told you it was a bomb. - Oh, my God. - I didn't say that. What, so-so it's electrical? - We have have to stop the train. - Yeah, why haven't we? Look, I need to get on that roof. GIRL: Oh, my God... [grunts] There's no way you can do that. People will die if I don't do something. This train's going 250 miles per hour. How do you expect to be able to stay up there? Look, I'm not asking for anyone to risk their lives. I'm asking for a boost. Trust me. - I can help. - Great. I think there's a roof hatch up here. Fine. Fine. Hey, actually, do you still have that duct tape? Yeah, I think so, yeah. Why? Give it to me. I'll show you. This should help with some grip up there.
