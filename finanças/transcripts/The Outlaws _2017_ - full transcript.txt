I've seen a lot of bad drunks, they were different... They didn't say where they're from, or where they'll go? One of the girls said, they had Chinese accent, she didn't understand much. But she said they're from gyeongsang province. What the hell... I was just at the hospital, they messed him up. Bro. I'll take care of it, look the other way. Are you a cop? Stay out of this. But he's like family! I meant what I said. I'll call if I need anything. Okay. Come here. Send our boys and look into it. Right away. What about the rest? This is all, we don't carry large amount. Then go make some money, the debt won't go away. Don't forget why i kept you alive. - Got it? - I'll do my best. Where do you get your girls? We pay a Chinese agency $10k and they send us girls. Any problems bringing them in? They're on invitation visa, so, not really. Do everything that makes money. Kill or chop limbs, if there's demand. Collect protection money. Isu gang won't let it happen. Who? They're from yanbian, arcade and karaoke's their turf. Then we'll start from there. I understand. That was the lab, their prints aren't in the database. Probably smuggled in. Hold on, stop! What's this? - Isn't that you? - That's you! Why were you there? That's totally not me. Look, the clothes aren't the same. Bullshit, I recognized you right away. Of course not. Look for the suspects, will you? I found them, but the quality's terrible. - That's them? - Yes. Zoom into it. This is the closest it'll go. So proud of you. You're a model cop to all your juniors. I don't know what you mean. - Gather around. - What's up? Grease the boys and find out who they are. Got it. Know your limits, or don't get caught. I'm on the edge lately. Who is that? Son of al you gotta know something. How should I know? Then should I? You don't know about guys who smuggled in? Why do you assume it's me? I don't even go to bars. Watch your goddamn attitude. You ate one, get the bill. They're gyeongsang boys, if you don't catch them, I'll take you in. That's batshit insane. Don't go insane, just catch them. - Sir, let's move. - How much is it? - $84 please. - Pay him $84. - What's fucking $84? - I got some take-out too. - 80, right? - Yup, 80. 807? Come on, dude!

This is bad, it's no ordinary murder. - Gather around. - Yes, sir. Dong-gyun. These assholes are going all-out, we gotta get all the body parts before anyone else do, okay? Scour every inch of this area. - Hong-seok, come here. - Yes, boss. - As for you, - yes? Go around and gather these garbage bags with patrol officers. Yes, sir. Boss, I think it's venom. He's really dead. What are you doing?! This is a crime scene! I'm sorry! That truck! Hey! Stop that garbage truck! Go stop it! The garbage truck! What is it? What's up?! - Wait! Stop! - Stop the truck! Stop! Stop! Stop! Police, we need to go through your garbage. Sir! - Is this your route? - Yeah. Sorry about this, it won't take long. Sure thing. I'm at the crime scene, the body's dismembered. - Stinks like hell... - We got a garbage truck. No, it's not from the truck, body's not ided yet, we only got an arm. I'll call you back! Found it. - You got it? - We got it, sir. Brings the boys. Sure. Big money. Hit me! Big money! Give me a hit! This machine's fucked! Took all my money! What the fuck you looking at?! Where are you?

I'm nuts, got a problem? - You're too loud. - Sorry, boss. Who are you? Where's your boss? Who the fuck's this? You wanna go, is that it? The boss inside wants you. Venom? Aren't you... Up to date on current affairs? Look at this chump. Make sure they don't run! Yes, boss! Who are you? Welcome. Welcome, indeed. Sit down. A handsome fella. I heard you protect this place. And the mahjong joint too. You must be loaded. Sure. I won't touch that one. But I'm taking this place. You must be out of your mind. You're the axe guy from the bar incident? It's already going around? You got a death wish? - Boss! - Where you going? Rat fucking cunt! What should we do with the boys outside? Pull that out, you're a dead man. What say you? Don't come around here anymore. Got it? Leave. Let's go. A real case for once, not a knife fight like others. Is this all? Yes. We even searched landfills, but nothing else. These cuts here, they're axe wounds? Looks like it but why so many stabs? This cut was made when he was alive. The skin dries when it was cut while there's blood flow. Savages... Why during such a crucial period? - What's crucial? - You know... I had a drink with head of police affairs last week, I'm ♪1 on the promotion list! He told me to be careful of everything. Is that really important right now? I'm just saying, because it's a big case. Let's bring them in quick, they're just 3 guys. Easy for you to say. Let's go eat. Okay. Pathetic bastards. Go wash up for once. Give us some money, cap. Put it under expenses. My socks started rotting. We're at expense cap. Give the boy some money. Oh my head... It hurts... Take care of it, i left my wallet in the car. Bullshit, I brought your wallet. Conniving bastard... He's loaded. - Wait, my wallet! - Credit card? Wait, what's that? That's mine! Sons of bitches! That's my gas money! - Thank you, boss! - Your wallet. Give it back! Give it! Goddammit... We're taking over this area, pay us $1k a month. After paying rent and expenses, I'm penniless. So you won't pay up? I got nothing to pay you, money doesn't grow on trees! Son of a bitch! You wanna go?! Are you nuts? When did you turn into a gangster?! Pay up before I get violent, got it? Let go of me! I can get violent too! - Wanna go?! - You bitch! If you're penniless, you should die. Good work, buy yourself a drink. Thank you, boss. Good job. Close up and come home. Okay. Hey, get me a harbin beer. I gotta close. Does he treat you well? Hey. You shouldn't have an attitude to run a business. Am I right? I better curve your attitude. Fine, I'll do it, let me go. Yeah, it's me. The Chinese-Korean gangsters from changwon, any updates on it? I pulled up all reports on them, but it might be useless since they're smuggled in. Who the hell are they? They're called black dragon gang, they do anything that makes money. Got any photos of them? A few security cam captures, I'll send you those. - Yeah, that'd be helpful. - Understood. Thanks. My informant told me they're infamous in changwon. They lend money to other Chinese-Koreans, and they chopped limbs if debt wasn't paid back. That's insane. But they're all compatriots. I got baby skin, but it's dry lately. Rub some of this on me. The triceps where I can't reach. Should I go get some venom gang boys? Yeah, venom's Minion, get him. They got some new recruits. Then check for venom tattoos. I understand. - Want some eggs? - Of course. Sure. Hong-seok, want some eggs? No, I'm fine. I got a shell, asshole. Peel it properly. My apologies... Why's the egg so dry? It's boiled egg... Right. Why did you transfer here anyway? Others are begging to work in the intelligence. Serious crimes unit is the heart of police. Heart of police my ass. - Smuggled in through busan - 5 previous victims - smuggled in through busan - 5 previous victims his degree's wasted here. So, how do you like it? It's no walk in the park? No... This area is notorious. Show your badge, they just smirk. They see a badge, they start stabbing. He's still green, it's all about experience. Eat it when it's cooked! - It's okay, this is beef. - That's lamb, idiot. You got roundworms? Eat slowly, there's plenty of food. Put some more in. - Put more in. - Smells good in here. It's all yours what would you like? Lamb. That again? What? Okay. Don't look, 3 guys just walked in. I feel it, they're the ones. A plate of lamb skewers. Right away. Give us a large portion. Idiot. You like lamb? Of course. I don't like it. We eat it everyday. Want a drink too? Nope. Hey. Where's the toilet? - Dong-gyun, tail him. - It's out back. I'll follow him. Don't do anything stupid, just guard him. - Pour me a drink. - Sure. Dong-gyun, approach. Could I borrow your light? I haven't seen you around, where are you from? You wanna fucking die? Chinese? Byung-sik, block the door. So good. Wong-oh, come here, boy. - Bill, please! - Coming! Where in China? - How much? - $92, please. Go inside there for a minute. Okay. - Are you alright? - Hong-seok! - Hong-seok! Hong-seok! - Byung-sik! Call ambulance! Now! Hong-seok, it's okay! Move! Move! Come here! - Gone? - He's gone. Goddamn! I'm gonna kill those fuckers! I told you to guard the door! You thought fucking him would get you something? Don't leave home, got that?! Asshole! You didn't do shit as my husband! What? Come at me! I dare you! Useless bastard! What have you done for me?! One lousy shop was all I got! Yeah? Stab me, go on. Who is it?! I live downstairs, why're you so loud?! Fuck off, asshole! Motherfucker... What the fuck? Moving into my turf, eh? You got brass balls. But why did you boys kill venom? - For not paying his debt... - What debt? His man Gil-su lost a lot gambling in changwon. So you chopped him up for that? That's some next level shit. Look here. Where are they now? I really don't know, they're a suspicious bunch. I don't know anything. Right, why'd you know. Fucking hell. Enough. Shit. You're a disloyal prick, you just accepted defeat. Am I right? Mr. hwang... I'll kill him myself, please give me a chance. Just one chance. Police hospital which room? - ♪533, over there. - Here. - Kang Hong-seok... - It's a 6-patient room. - Hong-seok! - Boss! - How are you? - I'm fine. Hello there. - Your fiancée? - Yes, this is det. Ma. - I heard so much about you. - Likewise. I'm sorry about everything. What did the doctor say? He wants me here for 2 weeks for potential infection. Give me that. Our department will cover the bill, so don't worry about that. But we all chipped in too... - Boss, it's... - Be quiet. No, we can't. Please take it, it's a small gesture. Have some meals together. I'm pissing blood doing your work, idiot. When will you come back? I thought about it a lot, I don't think i can do this anymore... I'm sorry. Don't be, you idiot, I'm sorry that you got hurt. I'm so scared... I tried to overcome it, but I just can't... Everyone feels the same, they just pretend not to be. After getting stabbed a few times, I freak out whenever I see knives. Gonna go back to the intelligence? Yes, I'd like to do that. Okay, I'll put in a word for you, so get plenty of rest while at it. It's okay, idiot! Go inside. Yo, byung-sik. Black dragon boys are quiet. I don't see any of them. Then... Keep an eye on jang isu's boys. They'll make a move. - Onit! - Okay. - Wong-oh! - Yes? Are you hurt? Because of me last time... Dammit...

Punk, go easy. Easy, easy! - You're being a baby! - You prick... - It's hot but it'll feel good. - That hurts! - You like this job? - Yes. - Did you meet mom? - Yes, she's well. That's enough. Aren't you mad that she's living with someone else? None of my business, she has her own life. Good, that's one way of putting it. You're all grown up now. I'm 15 already. Right. Then sit down, sit. Since you're an adult, have a drink. You're making me drink? Sure. Hey, come back! - Have a drink! - I don't want some. Come here, now! I'll give you something good.

Son of a bitch! Get that fucker! Jang isu! You bitch! I told you to stay the fuck away! Do you know who I am?! I'm harbin's jang chen! You fucking asshole! This is a banquet hall in garibong district, Seoul. Caused this scene of chaos by spraying a fire extinguisher. A Chinese-Korean gangster caused this scene of chaos by spraying a fire extinguisher. Then a man wielding an axe attacked several party guests. It was a fight between 2 rivals gangs. Let's pack up. They're going all-out. What's the point of serious crimes unit? We're short-staffed, and Hong-seok's out... Is that why you couldn't close this case? - You know what I mean. - Is that so? I should've brought you a full troop. - We really are short on men... - I see, it's all my fault. No cooperation from the shop owners too. Why the hell not? Even if we deport these fucks, they'll come back with a new ID, locals are scared of payback, nothing we can do. Did we ever need help to work a case? It's about arresting 2 fucks. If you had the time to talk back, go and find these bastards. - Are we jerking off here? - Go and find them! What's with you two? Cap, a word outside please? - You stay put. - Let go! Alright. - Captain, be the better man. - Pompous bastard! He's too much... Say what? What did you just say? You son of a bitch! Goddammit! Jesus fuck... - Be cool. - Let go of me! This unit's all fucked up. Let go! Let go! I'll calm him down. What's with you? Listen, do this properly and you're a captain. Honest to god, I'll make it happen. I don't care about that, we'll get the bastards, so don't nag the boys. How was I nagging? Can't a captain push them? Are we jerking around? They haven't gone home in 2 weeks, look at them! You and I've been doing this for 15 years, you know better. You think I like what I'm doing? I get no support but they breathe down my neck. I got it, stop trying to be their boss right now. Go easy on the boys. Promotion is least of my worries now. - Cap! - What?! The chief wants to see you. You're so dead, see you. He wants you too. Why me? - It's so much better. - Yeah? - Salute! - Come in, sit. You called me? This is cpt. Kang from Seoul Metro homicide. They're heading up this case, cpt. Jeon and det. Ma. Hello. Why's homicide here? Your suspect is on China's most wanted list. I got an official doc from China yesterday. His name is jang chen, he was an enforcer in a harbin gang. - About 300 men... - Harbin? Why is he here then? In 2000, his boss was arrested and received death penalty, and he smuggled in via busan pier... In any case, this case is transferred over to homicide, got it? What? Why? I got shit on by the commissioner! At my age... We're almost ready for a sweep, and to hand it all over... Should've done it earlier! What have you done in 2 months? Captain, you didn't brief him on our operation? What? - Oh yeah! - That's why. Chief, the thing is, we were originally after 3 perps, but their gang is bigger now. We're trying to bring them in with a mop-up op, so we've been making some preparations. This guy's selling snake oil. Buddy, be quiet. It's your chance to be on the front page. - You think... - Wait a minute. - So, how many arrests? - Well, about... 5 or 6... - 25! - Yeah, 25! - At least 25! - 25 or more! What did you say to me... It was hard wrangling them up, the op is ripe for picking, give us time to harvest! If we don't catch them, I'll quit the force. Enough! What! Don't shout at me! Sir, you heard him, that prick said... Buddy! Look at this punk, who are you calling prick?! - What are you doing?! - Let's calm down and talk. - I'll show you what I got! - Come here! Be cool! You bet your jobs on this! Get them or you're done! Okay, give us 10 days. 10 days it is, starting countdown today! Yes, sir! Thank you, sir! - I never said I'd quit... - Captain, let's have a word! That's quite enough, I'm sorry about this. Let's shake on it, shake and make up. Tell your captain... Coming to our home and stirring shit up, eh? What in the world? Homicide captain has jackshit for manners. Looks like you won't get the promotion. It doesn't matter now. But how will you catch 25 gangsters? We'll get them. Talking is easy, huh? Get them? - Sure, you can get them. - Sir. - Thanks, bud. - Here. How's your face? It's getting better. You're free to come back. Intelligence is boring, sitting and typing all day. I know a plastic surgeon, call me if you need him. He'll make you a new person. If it's so good, you should go. And you? Stretch my face and you get you. See you. - Bye. - Yeah. 100 guest rooms, hostess bar in the basement. Cafe on the ground floor. Buffet restaurant on top. They've been like that for 3 months. They took over several others by doing the same. Mr. jang, if you get rid of them, I'll pay you half a mil. Have a great meal. - Not coming? - I'm not hungry. When can you begin? No need to delay it, I'll start right away. But my estimate's off. What do you mean? $500k is too little. I need at least $1m. A man should stick to his guns. I won't change my mind, the final price is $1m. Do you take us for fools? $500k is a lot, others will do it for a lot less. Mr. gwak, don't look at me like that. Got that? I'll give you $100k advance. Are you kidding? I need $500k up front. It's our first deal, i need insurance. Take care of hwang, and I'll give you the rest. Who's Mr. hwang? He runs hostess bars in garibong district. I'm sure you know him, you took his manager's hand. That's why I wanted you. Hurry up! What the shit? Boss! We gotta move! Fucking bastards! Get him! I don't believe this... Who the fuck were they?! Fuck you! You bastard! Who ordered you?! Who?! Just kill me, fucker! Son of a bitch! Stand up straight. Goddammit, I told you to stay the fuck out of this. What? Where's hwang? This is a bad time, leave us. Does he take me for a bitch dick? Come again? I'm not in the mood, so leave us alone. Motherfucker. Fuck off. Find 10 good men and send them my way. Dipshit! How dare you defy me? I told you to stay put! You tried to bury him in broad daylight?! Did you expect me to stay down like a senile fuck? He took my boy's hand! So did you get him? If you can't do it right, then why bother?! And what have you been doing?! I'll fucking whip your shit! You know what I'm like! I'll find peace only when i get him and take his hand. Get 3 men to surrender tomorrow. Say what? One's going in for assult and damaging public property. And wear this stab proof vest. Don't get stabbed to death. Goddammit! You fucking wear it! I did my best, but he should go to an er. Thank you, I'll pay you later. I got it. Take care. You're hiding something from me. What do you mean? Get up. On your feet. Did your hubby mention anything? He didn't say anything... Fucking bitch! There are 2 things i don't tolerate: Stealing from me and lying to me. For the last time, what did he say? I didn't know he'd do that, that's the truth! Who ordered him?! Hwang's men came to my home once. Hwang? Ladies and gentlemen, we'll go over everything in detail. - One moment please. - Be quiet. - Attention, please! - Clap! Attention, please. Thank you so much for giving us your time today. As you know, black dragon is out of control. I know they've caused a ton of grievance. That's why we plan to arrest the entire gang, but that requires your cooperation. Please, hear me out. To be frank, we haven't ided all of them and many are new, so it's difficult for us to keep track of them all. So, if you could send us even a tiny tip, we'll mobilize and arrest them all... How do you expect us to trust you? We always get backstabbed. What's the point? Do you know what they're like? One mistake and they'll stab us. Gathering like this makes me nervous. That's why they're asking us for help! I'm leaving! Gentlemen! Why are you all so scared? This is why you're always victimized! You little brat! What'd you know! Did I say something wrong? These cops want to help, but you scurry away! Will you always stay as victims? Will you continue to work wearing stab proof vest? I don't have money to buy one and I have to work here! I can't live like this! Stabbings everyday, a person can't live this way! I've been doing this for 15 years, and if we leave them be, we'll only have more victims. They think they're above the law, we gotta lock everyone up. You're all my neighbors. I'm a resident here, you know that. I'm trying to make this place even a little safer, so your cooperation is crucial. They're dangerous, so stay away and take their pictures. Taking photos is the best way. You didn't have to say anything. Com here. I recognize one, but 2 are new. It doesn't have to be good. Just one picture. I see. - Looked into hwang? - Yes. He comes to work only on weekends. I better kill them all. - Anything else? - No, boss. - Collection? - Not everything yet. - Take care of it soon. - Yes, boss. You wanna close shop? Pay up! What's with you?! Those bastards... They take $500 to $1k. They collect on different days. I didn't want to pay him at first, but he threatened to kill me. The guys here were with the venom gang. They came to drink at my shop often, and they'd smash things up, it's unbearable. They come by everyaay to collect, they don't care if we don't have money. They're human trash. They're collecting eatlier and earlier. If they keep this up, we can't keep our shops. The boss doesn’t come around, just his minions come to collect. - Usually $1k at a time. - Yanbian gang's turf... - From garibong district... - They ransacked my shop... They hangout at the arcade... Black dragon gang boss jang chen why're there so many? They control the entire area, one member takes over as a manager, and bring in his own men. How many in total? We counted 26 so far. You were right on the money. It'll take a few days to get everyone. We gotta get him in a day. All of them in a day? If the word gets out, they'll flee. No, we don't have the resources. - Evening! - What brings you here? We need a precise plan... Hong-seok, you're hot in a suit. Evening. Divide into 2 teams. I'm talking here... When are you setting me up with a date? Sir, can I speak to you for a moment? Sure thing, come with me. - Get some beer! - Sure. And jang chen... jang chen... Why isn't anyone listening to me? Have a leg. - I like bbq chicken better. - There isn't any bbq... - What is it? - Well... Chinese officers are arriving next week. Homicide will be ordered to take the case with them. And take our hands off? Yes. It's a direct order from the commissioner. Your suspect will be repatriated. - Okay, off you go. - Bye. Hey! What will happen to him once he's sent back? He'll be tried, death penalty, at least. Hey, stop! You can't take him! That's enough, it's all over. This guy can't be sent back! It's an order from the top! These officers came to take him back. - Take him away! - Out of the way! - What's with you? - Grab him! That's enough, sir. - Don't make this into a thing! - Let go of me! Fuck, I just wanna talk! Come here. Listen carefully. If you tell me where jang is, I'll put you in a Korean jail. You can come out in a few months. If you go with them, you'll get death penalty. Think this through, it's your last chance. Bring him over. Boss, what's done is done. Hey! Hey! Get in. - Straight to the airport. - Yes, sir. You'll get a trial, but you're finished. So don't get an expensive lawyer. If you got money to burn, give them to me. Stupid idiot. Be careful. Oops. The deal went south. It's better this way, they weren't trustworthy. Why is it so hard to find a distributor here? What distributor? Why do you ask?! Perhaps I can be of service to you. What exactly can you do? Anything you can imagine. Take care. Call me when it's ready. Yes, I'll give you a call. Let's move. Quick, get in! Did he bite? They do look the part. He's a real actor! My heart was about to burst, but I got it done! Very good, be quiet. - Did you do good? - Of coursel - a small token of appreciation. - Thank you, sir! - We didn't do it for this. - Gonna count it here? Yeah? Then I'll take it back. What's with you? You didn't do it for money. - Keep your mouths shut. - Of course. It's so good! Why aren't you eating? Eat plenty. So they let you go? Yes, they don't get checked when they enter Korea. But why'd those officers ask you? They haven't found a distributor yet. Were they really officers? I'm sure. The Korean cops couldn't do shit. You know those officers smuggle shit on the side. We can make a shitload. You expect me to believe that? - Yang-tae. - Yes? Get the axe. This is a sample from their shipment. They have 100kg of it. They can't sell it in China, so they want to sell it here. They want to meet you to close the deal. We don't have the manpower, not even close. - Not eating? - Yes, understood. - Seok-do, SWAT is no go. - Then get the patrols. - What's that? Show me. - It's a list of perps. - Copy and hand it out. - Yes, sir. Gather around! Pick out as many young guys as possible. This can't leak no matter the cost, we have to get everyone even if it takes all night. Got it, sir! - Read it over. - Okay. Dong-gyun can cover siheung and ansan, and I'll take garibong and daerim. - Vehicles? - We got... 4 vans, 1 SUV, divided into 3 units. Incoming call! - Stop! Be quiet! - Quiet! Shush! Hold on. Answer it. Hello? I talked to my boss. Where should we meet? Chuwol hostess bar near daerim station at 9pm. Understood, I'll see you then. And? They'll be there. It's on. There's still a lot to prep, let's get a move on! - Good work, eat up! - Thank you. I should be coming here to have fun. Hurry up! - Let's move! - Moving! - Evening, sir. - Yo. We reserved room ♪7. - Your people are gone? - Yes, they've evacuated. We're getting jang tonight, no mistakes! - Understand, sir. - Yes, boss. I'm buying a round afterwards! Don't get hurt, and guard your positions. - Who are you looking for? - Thunder, dragon. Thunder, dragon, you got guests! Those bastards! Come here! Don't movel son of a bitch! I got you, asshole! My arm's in! My arm! You gotta open up when an arm is inside. Stupid bitch! Dude, I'm so nervous. Me too. - Anything? - Nothing so far. Intersection is clear. Target inbound. Okay. They're here.

It's me, the hotel job's done. I killed hwang. Yes. I gotta fly out to China now, get me my money. I just did. Confirm what, dammit! Okay, where? I'll see you there. I want it in Chinese bills. You go this way, and you that way! Search every inch! We're at yanji diner intersection. Where's this asshole? - I'm busy, what! - Boss. Jang chen, that bastard. - He works for gwak. - Who the fuck is that? Mr. gwak from siheung. He's con man who's building a hotel. He got jang to destroy my shop. He came to your shop? Your call cannot be... Mr. ma... That fucker... He told me to give up my hotel. That bastard gwak... - He was quiet for a while... - I gotta go. Mister! Sir! Hey! What happened?! What's going on?

Gwak that you mentioned, where is this fucker? Shit, I don't know! He went out on a rampage without telling us first. I confirmed that he attacked hwang's shop. I'm on the way, so have the money ready. - I'm not paying him. - What? You take me for a fool? How will you handle the backlash? I never intended to pay that gangster. Mr. gwak! Get him! Let go! Let me go, you fuckers! Mr. jang. You can't just do whatever. What's this? Your money, $900k. Are you trying to fuck me?! How will you get on a plane with cash? You can withdrawal anywhere with that. I don't believe youl! I'm serious! If you're lying to me, you're a dead man! - Got that? - I understand. All done? Buddy. You wasted so much tissue, you don't even pay tax. You alone? Yeah, I'm still single. Too bad about that ticket, you won't get to fly. Dammit... You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch! - What's going on? - He's coming out. Seok-do! Where's jang chen? He's inside the washroom. - Go check it out. - Yes, sir! Seok-do, you did good. Right, sorry. Throw this out for me. I made a bit of a mess, take care of it. Don't worry, I'll sort things out. - Go to the er, okay? - Okay. - Excuse me. - Yeah? - Are you his boss? - Yes, I am. There was a lot of damage, we'll need to claim it. We're serious crimes unit, we can do this later... You must be so tired. We'll need to claim damages, may I get your ID? Bro, did you sort things out? Where are you? Going home, of course.
