WHAT? THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS! OF COURSE IT IS. OF COURSE IT IS. THAT'S WHY I NEED TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL. I NEED YOU TO BE CALM, I NEED YOU TO HELP ME PREPARE YOUR CASE. OKAY, SEXUAL ABUSE OF A MINOR IS A HEAVY CHARGE. IT CARRIES A MINIMUM 5-YEAR SENTENCE. ARE YOU TRYING TO FREAK ME OUT OR CALM ME DOWN? CALM YOU DOWN. [ EXHALES ] THIS IS A NIGHTMARE -- I HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND THE SCHOOL BOARD SUSPENDED ME. I KNOW, AND THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DEAL WITH THIS IS IF YOU TELL ME EVERYTHING. SO, LET'S START WITH THE SIMPLE FACTS. HOW OLD ARE YOU AGAIN? 27. [ DOOR OPENS ] HEY, BRIAN. HEY, DREW. SO, UH, BAIL'S ALL TAKEN CARE OF, WE CAN LEAVE ANY TIME. OKAY, 27, BUT, UH, YOU COULD PASS FOR YOUNGER. UH, I'M SORRY, WHAT'S THE POINT HERE? WELL, SHE'S YOUNG, ATTRACTIVE, THE KIDS PROBABLY LOVE YOU... COULD THE BOUNDARIES HAVE GOTTEN BLURRED? YEAH, YEAH, I WOULD SAY THAT, UH, SEXUAL ASSAULT IS A BLURRING OF THE LINES, OKAY? NO, HE MEANS DID I BLUR THE LINES, DREW. NO. OKAY, BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT THE D.A. HAS GATHERED SOME PRETTY DAMAGING TESTIMONY AGAINST YOU. UH, YOU THREW A HOMEROOM PARTY DURING SCHOOL HOURS IN WHICH JOSH WAS INVITED, EVEN THOUGH HE'S NOT A MEMBER OF YOUR HOMEROOM CLASS. NO, NO, NO. HE SHOWED UP. I DIDN'T INVITE HIM... UNTIL HE SHOWED UP. AND THEN YOU DID. INVITE HIM. YEAH, OKAY, UH, SOME OF THE STUDENTS HAVE SAID YOU SINGLED HIM OUT FOR SPECIAL ATTENTION. I QUOTE, YOU WERE SEEN IN "INTIMATE SETTINGS." I WAS TUTORING HIM. QUOTE, WITH YOUR "HAND ON HIS SHOULDER." YOU'RE WORKING HARD, YOU'RE GONNA PASS CHEM, I'M SURE OF IT. Fiske: I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE A STUDENT. "SHE DRESSED LIKE A KID, IN TIGHT JEANS." QUOTE -- "SHE WAS TRYING TO BUY HER STUDENTS' AFFECTIONS." Student: THANKS, MS. DAWSON. QUOTE -- "ONE DAY DURING TEACHERS' SWIM," "I SAW JOSH AND MRS. DAWSON HORSING AROUND TOGETHER IN THE POOL." HE WAS SEEN "TOUCHING HER ROMANTICALLY." HELLO JOSH, MRS. DAWSON. AND SO ON AND SO ON... IS THIS SOME KIND OF WITCH HUNT? YEAH. YEAH, IT IS. I MEAN, PEOPLE ARE ON HIGH ALERT FOR SEXUAL PREDATORS. WAIT, I'M NOT A SEXUAL PREDATOR. HEY, YOU WATCH YOUR MOUTH. OKAY, WHOA, WHOA. I'M IN TROUBLE, AREN'T I? [ EXHALES ] LOOK, LOOK... THE GOOD NEWS IS ALL OF THEIR EVIDENCE IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL. I CAN BUILD A REALLY GOOD REASONABLE DOUBT CASE. I REALLY THINK I CAN GET YOU OFF HERE. THINK? WHAT IS THIS "GET YOU OFF" CRAP, OKAY? I MEAN WH-WHOSE LAWYER ARE YOU? YOURS. OKAY? YOURS. BUT YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN, YOU NEED TO GO HOME. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO PREPARE. NOW LISTEN TO ME, THIS IS A RUNAWAY TRAIN AND IT IS COMING STRAIGHT AT YOU. HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW ABOUT YOUR SON'S DANGEROUS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER? Mrs. Gaines: WELL, WE COULD TELL JOSH WAS TROUBLED, WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHY. Mr. Gaines: WE WERE TOO TRUSTING. OH, THAT IS SUCH BULL! PUT THAT BACK ON. YOU DON'T NEED TO HEAR THIS CRAP. THEY ARE PLAYING THE MEDIA AND WE JUST SIT HERE LETTING THEM GET AWAY WITH IT. LET BRIAN HANDLE YOUR DEFENSE, HONEY. FINE. I'LL HANDLE THE OFFENSE. FIRST THING TOMORROW, I'M GOING BACK TO SCHOOL. SCHOOL? SCHOOL? THE LAST TIME YOU WENT TO SCHOOL -- I'M GOING TO SEE DAVIS AND GET REINSTATED. SHE CAN'T REINSTATE YOU. YOU'VE JUST BEEN ACCUSED OF A FELONY! FINE, I'LL CALL THE UNION. NO, NO. LEAVE DAVIS ALONE, OKAY? DON'T STIR HER UP. STIR HER UP ABOUT WHAT? TO GO ON TV AND SAY MORE BAD STUFF ABOUT YOU. PERCEPTION IS ALREADY BAD ENOUGH. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, DREW? THAT... OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S A PERCEPTION OUT THERE, THAT THIS IS YOUR FAULT, THAT YOU LED HIM ON. IT'S WHAT YOU REALLY THINK, ISN'T IT? NO. NO. IT'S THE PERCEPTION. WHAT HAPPENED TO, "DON'T BLAME YOURSELF, CHRISTIE"? SOMETIMES YOU PUT OUT SIGNALS, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT. LET'S TALK ABOUT SIGNALS, DREW. YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT SIGNALS I'M GETTING RIGHT NOW? A MAN -- A BOY -- ASSAULTS A WOMAN AND HE GETS A FREE PASS, EVEN FROM HER HUSBAND. HEY! THAT'S NOT FAIR. AND THE WOMAN? SHE HAS ONLY HERSELF TO BLAME FOR NOT SEEING IT COMING FIRST. I DIDN'T SAY THAT! NO, YOU SIGNALED IT. OHH...GOD, I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE I DID IT WRONG. I JUST WANTED TO BE FRIENDS WITH THE KIDS. I CARE ABOUT THEM. I FEEL -- OH, GOD. CHRISTIE... CHRISTIE? [ COUGHING ] CHRISTIE? [ VOMITING ] CHRISTIE, ARE YOU OKAY? DREW, I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE. UH... I'M SO SORRY, BABE. A BABY...NOW. WHAT A MESS. LOOK, DO YOU WANT THE BABY? [ Whispering ] Do you? Yeah. Yeah. WE'RE GOING TO BEAT THIS, DREW. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME NOT TO START AN OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION. YOU TOLD ME TO JUST WORK THIS OUT WITH HIM. WHERE DID THAT LEAD? HE ASSAULTED ME, MS. DAVIS. IN MY HOME. I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT. I INSIST UPON BEING REINSTATED. I LOVED MY JOB. I WANT IT BACK. I WISH I COULD HELP. I DEFENDED YOU LAST NIGHT, MRS. DAWSON, IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL BOARD. IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR MY INTERVENTION, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN DISMISSED. I AM CERTAIN WHEN YOU GO TO COURT -- WILL YOU TESTIFY? WELL, IF THEY ASK ME, OF COURSE I'LL TESTIFY. I'LL TELL THEM WHAT YOU SAID. BUT I'LL ALSO HAVE TO TELL THEM WHAT JOSH GAINES SAID, AND THAT IS THAT YOU CAME ON TO HIM. GREAT. GREAT. SO HAVE THAT ON MY DESK BY 3:00, OKAY? WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU DOING HERE? I WANT YOU TO TAKE YOUR SON TO THE POLICE AND HAVE HIM TELL THEM WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. JOSH DID SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND YOU -- GET OUT OF HERE AND STAY AWAY FROM MY SON. I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AROUND HIM AGAIN. YOU'RE LYING, YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DONE. THIS IS MY LIFE AT STAKE. I'M CALLING THE POLICE. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] [ RING ] Josh: MS. DAWSON. HOW THE HELL DO YOU HAVE THE NERVE TO CALL ME? LOOK, I WISH NONE OF THIS HAPPENED. I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO GET YOU IN TROUBLE -- NO, STOP IT! YOU THINK YOU CAN APOLOGIZE TO ME? YOUR LIES... WOULD YOU LET ME EXPLAIN? HAVE GOTTEN ME ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. I MIGHT GO TO JAIL FOR WHAT YOU DID TO ME. THAT'S NOT FAIR. OKAY? Y-YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, I REALLY THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE IN-- NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE A SICK KID, JOSH, AND YOU NEED HELP. BUT RIGHT NOW, WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS GO TO THE COPS AND TELL THEM THE TRUTH. I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO GET IN TROUBLE. IT WAS MY PARENTS. MY FATHER WAS THE ONE WHO LIED TO THE COPS. THE HELL WITH YOUR FATHER! GO TO THE COPS AND TELL THEM YOU ASSAULTED ME, TELL THEM TO DROP THE CHARGES! NO. NO...YOU WANTED IT. I KNOW YOU DID. 'CAUSE I KNOW WHAT GIRLS THINK, CHRISTIE. GIRLS ARE ALWAYS LIKE THAT. [ EXHALES ] WHAT GIRLS ARE LIKE THAT, JOSH? SCREW YOU. HE'S NEVER GONNA CALL YOU AGAIN. YOU TRUST ME, OKAY? I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. NO, HE IS NOT THE PROBLEM, OKAY. NO ONE BELIEVES ME, DREW, NO ONE. GAINES HAS THE MONEY AND THE LAWYERS AND THE PR. I MEAN, I COULD LOSE. I COULD GO TO JAIL. YOU WON'T, OKAY? BRIAN IS ON TOP OF IT. WE NEED TO BE ON TOP OF IT. I'VE BEEN ON THE WEB -- GUYS WHO COMMIT AN ASSAULT ARE LIKELY TO HAVE DONE IT BEFORE. IF WE COULD GET SOMEONE ELSE TO TESTIFY... THAT'S GREAT, WE'LL GO SEE BRIAN IN THE MORNING, OKAY? [ EXHALES ] HEY... HOLD ON. WHAT IS THIS? JUST OPEN IT. OPEN IT! OKAY. I DON'T KNOW, I THOUGHT WE'D, UH, GET A HEAD START ON THE DEBATE, THERE. [ BOTH LAUGHING ] I GOT SOME NAMES FOR YOU. YEAH? FOLSOM, ATTICA. THAT'S VERY FUNNY. THANK YOU. [ COMPUTER BEEPS ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [ DOORBELL RINGS ] HI, MRS. HOBSON. I'M SO SORRY TO DISTURB YOU SO EARLY, BUT... I REALLY NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOUR DAUGHTER. JENNA DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO TELL YOU. HER LIFE IS GOING REAL GOOD. LET IT BE. PLEASE. COME ON! JENNA! I'M HERE BECAUSE I NEED YOUR HELP. I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. YOU'RE THE BEST TEACHER WE EVER HAD. I WISH. JENNA, DO YOU THINK THAT JOSH GAINES ATTACKED ME? YES. WHY? CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING PERSONAL? I WASN'T HERE LAST YEAR. WHY WERE YOU OUT OF SCHOOL FOR SIX WEEKS? I WAS SICK. I'M NOT HERE TO LECTURE YOU OR TO JUDGE YOU, OKAY? I JUST REALLY NEED SOME HELP. I WOULD. BUT I CAN'T. YES, YOU CAN. I'M GONNA TAKE A WILD GUESS, AND IF I'M WAY OFF BASE, JUST TELL ME, OKAY? [ SIGHS DEEPLY ] YOU USED TO GO OUT WITH JOSH. EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. I'M GUESSING THAT THE SIX WEEKS AWAY FROM SCHOOL HAD TO DO WITH HIM. DID JOSH HURT YOU? DID HE RAPE YOU? I DON'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN TO SOMEONE ELSE. IF YOU TESTIFIED IN COURT, THEY WOULD BELIEVE BOTH OF US. SWEETIE, I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU. I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO DARTMOUTH, AND LIKE YOUR MOM SAID, THINGS ARE GREAT NOW. SO IF YOU CAN'T DO IT, IT'S OKAY. I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND. [ CRYING ] I CAN'T. OKAY. YOU WANT TO LEAVE? DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE NOW? IT'S OKAY. [ SIGHS ] HOW'D IT GO? JOSH RAPED HER. [ SIGHS ] OKAY, UM... I'LL CALL BRIAN. SHE'S NOT GONNA TESTIFY. DO WHAT? WHAT? SHE HAS TO. JUST LEAVE IT ALONE, DREW. SHE'S HURT. LOOK, I TALKED TO BRIAN THIS MORNING, HE SAID THE JUDGE WANTS TO PULL THE TRIAL UP. WHAT? WHY? I DON'T KNOW, HE SAID THE GAINESES ARE BEHIND IT. THEY WANT THE TRIAL TO GO ON WHILE THE PR THEY'RE DOING IS STILL FRESH. I TOLD HIM ABOUT YOUR HUNCH. HE SAID WE COULD REALLY USE THAT TESTIMONY. AND WHAT ABOUT THAT REASONABLE DOUBT CASE? HE'S NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT. MAYBE -- I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE JENNA JUST DOESN'T REALIZE THAT IT'S YOUR WHOLE LIFE THAT'S AT STAKE RIGHT HERE. SHE CAN'T TALK. I'M NOT FORCING HER TO. CHRISTIE, WE NEED THE HELP. CHRISTIE, YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOU INVITED JOSH TO DINNER. WHAT? I NEVER INVITED HIM ANYWHERE. YOU WERE SEEN TOGETHER AT A RESTAURANT AWAY FROM SCHOOL. NO, HE INVITED ME FOR A HAMBURGER TO THANK ME FOR OFFERING TO TUTOR HIM. HE HAD BEEN HUMILIATED BY HIS PARENTS IN FRONT OF ME AND THE PRINCIPAL, OKAY? I FELT SORRY FOR HIM. HE INVITED ME. THAT'S NOT THE STORY THE GAINESES ARE TELLING. CAN'T WE STOP THEM FROM LYING? I WARNED YOU BOTH, OKAY? A CASE LIKE THIS, IT'S ABOUT PERCEPTIONS, IT'S NOT ABOUT REALITY. I'M GONNA LOSE, AREN'T I? WHAT ABOUT THIS JENNA GIRL? NO, NO, SHE'S NOT GONNA TESTIFY. SHE'S BEEN THROUGH TREMENDOUS PRESSURE, AND SHE'S HAD ENOUGH. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT US ANYMORE. I WON'T HURT THE GIRL! YOU CAN'T GO TO JAIL. LOOK, THERE'S ONE OTHER OPTION. OKAY? ONE -- ONE OTHER OPTION. YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE IT. SIT DOWN, PLEASE. WHAT? ALL RIGHT. [ SIGHS ] PLEA BARGAIN. I CAN'T PROMISE ANYTHING, BUT WE CAN TRY. TO GET WHAT? YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET PROBATION, NO TIME SERVED. WHICH MEANS? YOU'D BE CONVICTED OF A FELONY, BUT YOU'D PLEAD GUILTY TO A LESSER CHARGE. NO JAIL. NO TRIAL. PLEADING GUILTY? FOR HIS CRIME? NO WAY! ABSOLUTELY NOT! FORGET THAT! I KNOW IT SOUNDS UGLY, BUT I'M AFRAID WE REALLY NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU FOR COMING, MONICA. THIS IS REALLY WEIRD, MS. DAWSON. I KNOW. WELCOME TO MY LIFE. IT'S PLENTY WEIRD, BELIEVE ME. IT'S ABOUT JOSH, RIGHT? RIGHT. HE ASSAULTED ME. I DIDN'T ASSAULT HIM. I CAN BELIEVE IT. HE'S A TOTAL HORN DOG. I MEAN, WHEN HE DOESN'T GET IT... HE GETS VIOLENT? HE EXPECTS IT, I MEAN, HE KNOWS WHAT A BABE HE IS. HE...GIRLS PRACTICALLY THROW THEMSELVES AT HIM. AND IF A GIRL REFUSED HIM? HE WOULDN'T THINK IT WAS, LIKE, VIOLENCE OR ANYTHING. JUST, YOU KNOW, CUTTING THROUGH THE CRAP. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO TESTIFY? AT LEAST WITH MY LAWYER. AND YOUR PARENTS COULD BE THERE. [ LAUGHING ] LIKE I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT SEX IN FRONT OF THEM! LOOK, I REALLY... I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY THAT WOULD HELP YOU. I MEAN, HE NEVER REALLY HURT ME. OKAY. I'M SORRY, MS. DAWSON.

OKAY, IF I CAN GET IT, WE PLEAD GUILTY TO A LESSER CHARGE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT, BUT IT WILL HAVE TO BE A FELONY, AND A FELONY WILL FOLLOW YOU FOREVER. YOU'LL DRAW SOME KIND OF SENTENCE WHICH WE'LL GET COMMUTED TO PROBATION. THEN YOU START YOUR LIFE OVER AGAIN, AS FAR AWAY FROM HERE AS POSSIBLE. I AM SO SORRY. I'LL, UH... I'LL WAIT OUTSIDE. I CAN'T DO THIS. I KNOW. BUT WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO? WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE? WE FIGHT. WE GO TO COURT. I'M INNOCENT, DREW. WE WIN THE CASE. BRIAN SAYS OUR CHANCES ARE LESS THAN 50/50, OKAY? WHAT IF YOU LOSE? ARE YOU GONNA HAVE THAT BABY IN PRISON? NO. NO WAY. EXACTLY. THEY WANT ME TO ADMIT I'M A CHILD MOLESTER. HOW CAN I POSSIBLY SAY THAT? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. BUT LOOK, OKAY, LET'S IMAGINE WE TAKE THE PLEA BARGAIN. I MEAN, WHAT REALLY HAPPENS? WE MOVE. WE START OVER. WE HAVE A CLEAN SLATE. YOU DON'T GO TO PRISON. THE BABY IS UNTOUCHED BY ALL OF THIS CRAP.

THEN WE'RE STUCK. YEAH. IN THE INTERESTS OF THE GAINES FAMILY AND OF THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE, THE OFFICE OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS AGREED TO A PLEA BARGAIN WITH MRS. CHRISTIE DAWSON. THE DEFENDANT HAS PLEADED GUILTY TO THE LESSER CHARGE OF CHILD ENDANGERMENT AND HAS AGREED NEVER TO WORK AROUND CHILDREN AGAIN. NOW THE GAINES FAMILY WOULD LIKE TO PUT THIS INCIDENT BEHIND THEM AND MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES. WE FEEL THAT IDENTIFYING CHRISTIE DAWSON AS A SEXUAL PREDATOR BOTH PROTECTS OUR COMMUNITY AND TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF HER VICTIM. THANK YOU. [ REPORTERS SHOUTING ] UH, IS MS. DAWSON HERE? WHAT, JENNA? YEAH. COME ON IN. COME ON IN. SIT DOWN. THANK YOU. YOU MUST REALLY HATE ME. YOU MUST BE REALLY MAD AT ME. NO, NO, WE'RE NOT.

COME IN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ON A SATURDAY? YOUR HUSBAND TOLD ME YOU WERE HERE. I CAME TO TELL YOU HOW SORRY I AM I COULDN'T HELP YOU. NO, JENNA, DON'T FEEL BAD. I WON'T ALLOW IT. BUT YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD TEACHER. WHEN I HEARD THAT THEY WON'T LET YOU TEACH ANYMORE, I FELT SICK. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, I HAD A CHEMISTRY TEACHER IN HIGH SCHOOL WHO COMPLETELY INSPIRED ME. HE GAVE ME THIS PERIODIC TABLE. TAKE IT TO DARTMOUTH. I DON'T DESERVE THAT. YES, YOU DO. I AM SO PROUD OF YOU. THANKS, MS. DAWSON. YEAH... I'M READY NOW. I WANT TO TESTIFY. NO, JENNA, NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. I'M FINE WITH MY DECISION. REALLY, I'M READY NOW. I CAN DO IT. I WANT TO DO IT. DON'T. DON'T THROW AWAY DARTMOUTH. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE THAT SCHOOL IS. AM I RIGHT THAT THE GAINES WERE GONNA PAY FOR IT? I SAW IN YOUR RECORD THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE A SCHOLARSHIP. IT WAS WRONG. I KNOW IT. MY MOM DIDN'T WANT TO PUT ME THROUGH A TRIAL. SHE SAID I WAS TOO SICK. BUT SHE WANTED THEM TO PAY SOMEHOW. OH, THIS IS ALL MY FAULT. NO, NO, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. DON'T EVER SAY THAT. YOU DIDN'T INVITE JOSH TO RAPE YOU. NO, BUT I DIDN'T STAND UP TO HIM EITHER, NOT FOR YOU OR FOR ME. BUT I CAN NOW. PLEASE DON'T STOP ME. WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO TESTIFY, YOU SAID THAT TOGETHER WE COULD BEAT JOSH. DON'T YOU BELIEVE THAT ANYMORE? ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE READY FOR ALL THIS? POSITIVE. YOU'RE GONNA BE A GREAT MOM.
