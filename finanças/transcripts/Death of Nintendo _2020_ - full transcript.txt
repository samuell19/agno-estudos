No! Paolo? Are you okay? Where are you? Oh, there. What did I tell you? "Duck, cover...?" ..."and hold." But the earthquake is over, Ma. There might be another one soon. Where's your emergency pack? Where is it? What is it doing over here? How will you get it if it's way over here? What if you're trapped? I won't get trapped, Ma. What about you? Where's your emergency kit? I just panicked and came over here as soon as I can. This might give out soon. I'm gonna look for batteries. Stay there. Oh shoot, Ate Lina, you scared me. I thought you were... A White Lady? Nah. You know I don't believe in those things. What if I told you about the one that I saw in Calbayog? I was about... ... fourteen back then. Belen was the most beautiful woman in our town. You would fall for her for sure. But what they didn't know is that she had a very dark secret. That when night falls she would go around town and lure a man to follow her. Of course, he would follow her. But once you get close enough to her she would slowly turn to you and then... Hey, Kachi! Where are you going? Don't forget to take out the trash! Kachi! What took you so long? My mom's a pain in the butt. What's that? Hang on. What's that? This! I haven't opened it yet. Nice. Another new one. Let's open it. Let me do it! Whoa! I'll plug it in. Wait. Blow on it first. That'll do. Play it. Press start. What was that? Don't go there! Hang on. Ok, go. Son of a... Not again! What the heck! Perfect timing. Pao? Is everything alright? Oh. You're here. I made you a sandwich. It's getting too hot in here, Ma. We'll just go out to play ball. But it's much hotter outside. You might get darker or stinkier. We won't be out for too long. That's badass! Baptize those. They might get worn out too soon. Just save them for your birthday, ok? Gosh, Paolo. Your room's a mess. Hurry up! Let's go! Paolo, wait! Don't forget your towel! Kachi's waiting for me! Stay still! It's hot outside! Ma, enough. Wait, here! Baby boy, let's go play! Be safe! BOOM! (Paolo) You missed. It went in! Why are you doing all Jordan? Why not? Don't you know? He's da man! What about Pippen? What kind of a pick is that? You know who else is a badass? Who? Magic Johnson. Magic Johnson's a fag. He got AIDS. What's he talking about? You're the fag. Fuck did you say, nigga? By the way, Jordan's a ball hog. He's a wimp. And you're wimps. You're "suhpowt." "And he's "suhpowt." This one has a nice accent, so "slang." Fucking losers. Are you gonna tell your mom? What the fu.. ? Why don't you just leave them alone? Yeah. This ain't over fags. I'm still bigger than your puny little dyke bitch over there and her stupidass McMuffin excuse of a brother combined. Remember that. Paolo. Are you okay? He's so full of himself. Wow. Tight grip you got there. Practically hugging him. Oh, so tight! Why are you blushing? That's intense. You know you like it! Miss Four Cokes, please. Can I check the caps? Miss, I got a pog! Thank you. You know... That Jimbo is such a dick. Rotten American kid... I bet it's the milk they drink over there. Know what? For real Just give me another round with him. I can take him. What are you talking about? You just fell earlier. You have no chance. After I get snipped I'll be double his size. I just need to go to Mang Pido. In the province? But that's so old school. Nobody goes to the barrio witch doctor anymore. Is it even safe? Nah, it is! Look at my older brother After he got circumcised, he got way taller. What kind of milk is he drinking? It's not the milk! Circumcision makes you bigger. Alright. I'm in. You're in? When are you going? This summer. Paolo, let's go this summer. Let me think about it... Aw, c'mon, don't be shady! All of us should do it. It can't be just the two of us. Boys like us should get circumcised together so that they'll treat us like grown men. Come on. I'm in. Game. Alright!! Goooo... Joe!! Dumbass! It's late. Didn't I tell you when we got that Zelda game? That as long as you finish your homework and come home on time, you get any Nintendo game you want. Yes, Ma. Do you know how lucky you are to have the latest Nike and Reebok pumps? Thanks, Ma. Ma... Do you think it's time for me to get a... Should I... am I old enough to get a... Get a what? A circumcision. Circumcision? Where did you get that idea? Gilligan and Kachi... were gonna go to the barrio doctor... To Mang Pido? Are you kidding, Paolo? I'll just schedule you an appointment with Dr. Cruz. Well, Kachi's brother... He had it done with Mang Pido and... Well, sweetheart, Kachi and his family... can't afford to go to a real doctor. What's that? On your arm. Basketball. I fell. Kachi didn't take you to the squatters' area, did he? Just nearby. We were playing Horse. How did you fall if you were just playing that? And your towel. Where is it? I don't know. I was copying a Magic Johnson move. I tripped. It must have fallen off. Magic Johnson? That's the one who's HIV positive, right? You need to be more careful. Come on, go faster! We're losing. I already said thanks. Can't you just wait until they turn 18? Your kids don't get a say in that? It's their future too. However, I can take care of them here in Manila. We don't need to fly them across the world... Hello? Hello? Ma, give me that. Ate! Water, please. Are we turning on the generator? Ma, don't worry. It's only magnitude 2.5 tonight. Barely anything. Can we not turn on the generator tonight? My head hurts from the noise. Sure, Ma. Whatever you want. Ate, no generator tonight. Just fan Mama until she falls asleep. Oh, my babies, you're the best. Promise me we won't leave each other? And never settle for anything less than what you deserve. Dang, Ma. What are you saying? That's too deep. You'll understand what I'm talking about one day. For now, you're still too young with milk on your lips. Oh shoot, good thing you reminded me, Ma... Long story, Ma. Hey man, what were you able to get? Just two packs, man. That should do. Marlboro? Nah, man. Menthol. That's what my Ma smokes. What the heck? Philip fucking Morris? Why, you don't want it? We'll smoke it. Hey, no, fine, ok. We'll take 'em. How much? Twenty per pack. Pao! Gimme twenty pesos. Twenty. Pao! Killer looks, man! But seriously, dude. You don't have a chance. Everyone wants her. Isn't she seeing an older dude? I think he's our age. Just a bigger guy. Dream on. That's why we need to get it done. I'm telling you after we get snipped, girls will be coming in from all directions. Of course. But in the meantime... What's that? That's gonna help us grow! Yeah, bro. Found my dad's secret stash. Which one? Playboy? Hustler? Hustler, bro. I'm not into Playboy anymore. Done with that. The hard stuff of course. Ok, let me go first. Let's go! To the locker room! There we go. Game? Game. Turn the page. Turn the page. Ugly! Turn it back! That's it. I'm the champion! You always win. That's why they call me "The Flash." This is where I always win. Let's all go on three. Okay. One... two... three! No fair, Kachi! Bacon underwear always wins. Your underwear is so old, it's got claws that cling to the wall. You both lose again! Hi, Mimaw! Sup, aircon? Ey, Shiara. Did I say that right? Aircon? If you have holes in your underwear? I don't know, he's just kind of a loser sometimes... Look, you guys! Mine made quintuplets! You are so good, Shiara. Mine are only twins. Mine took 2 weeks just to make one. What about you? Have you played with Kisses before? Nope. It's easy. Here, I'll show you. I mean, I just don't believe in the logic that... Here. Hold this. We should separate the pink ones and the blue ones. The pink ones are for girls. While the blue ones are for boys. You need to put them in cotton to mate them. Then we'll put cologne. A bit of fragrance for romance. Then... We wait. Know what, guys, after we get circumcised, I'm gonna need some bigger briefs to accommodate my junk. Of course. You don't want the chicks chewing on your bacon. That's not how it works. How do you know? Have you had any? Not yet. See? I knew it. Let's check if they have babies yet. Oh. It's okay, Mimaw, if you're reproductively challenged. How about you bring in your Kisses next time? I'll diagnose them for you. Yeah, sure. Hey! Have you guys seen "Shake, Rattle & Roll"? That's way too scary for me. My parents don't let me watch that. I get nightmares every time I see their shows. I've seen it. Really? Oh my god. Have you seen the one with the Manananggal? Do you believe in them?* My grandmother saw one when she was my age. She did? Yeah. She knew exactly what to do. On the lower half of its body it had left behind, she sprinkled some salt. So awesome, right? I love my grandmother. Our maid once told me she saw a White Lady in the cemetery. When? Like last week. Oh my god. We're totally going. I don't wanna. No way. Sure, I'll go. You would? Oh my god! Shit! I'm so excited! By the way, Mimaw. We're gonna need some bodyguards. What was that all about? Are you guys friends now? Maybe. What did she say? What does she smell like? Like melons? Don't be gross. Stop that! You know... You should've put in a good word for our boy Paolo over here. Right? I don't know her that well. And I'm not sure if she's into you. She's into other stuff. Like what? Yeah. I know. Why would a girl like her even be interested in someone like me? Ok, ok, fine. I might know a way... Really? One more? Yeah. Sometimes you need to have a third eye to see those things. To see a White Lady? Yes. White Lady or a Manananggal. The Manananggal wears black instead of white... They rub oil onto their body, then they'll grow wings, the upper half of their body detaches from the lower body. When I was younger my mother was pregnant with my little brother. I was tasked to make sure no Manananggal would ever come to our house. I didn't really worry about it except on Holy Week, Good Friday, in particular, after our Lord is crucified. Why? Because on Good Friday, all the powers of the evil spirits are stronger. That's why I went to the cemetery to check if the Manananggal left her lower body. Paolo... Paolo... Paolo... Paolo... This is Grandma. She's my best friend. Grandma. This is Paolo. Ready? Paolo gising! Paolo! Wake up! Calm down. Mommy's here. Mommy's here. Maybe this will help you go to sleep. From Father Patrick at our prayer meeting. Just close your eyes and pray. Okay? Just pray. Hey! Mimaw Not so fast. Take it easy, Mimaw! Why? Be careful. Now that's more dangerous, bro. Find your spot. Slowpokes! Watch out for the ants. Gimme. Hey, me too. Thanks, dude. Of course. Paolo... Since when did you believe in Manananggals? Since he found out that Shiara believes in that. They could be real. My maid saw one too when she was young. Our maids tell us stories about them too. That doesn't mean we have to believe them. True. Well, it won't hurt to find out, right? Just help me plan the whole thing with Shiara. Nice. I want to make it special for her. You ok? Jeez, Paolo. Yeah, I'm fine. Just choked. Hey, bro. How come you didn't come home last night? Mom is pissed! She noticed? Uh, yeah, she noticed! You're in big trouble if she catches you. But dude... Did you get laid? Of course. But dude... She wasn't as good as Marilen. But man, she's got some huge tits. Wow, really? Keep it down! Kachi? Is that Badong with you? Come over here. Look at what you did. I'm not the one she's pissed at. Hey, Badong! Wow! Come over here. How many times do I have to tell you to stop hoeing around! Like mother, like son. Except my lovers don't pay me. Should've seen that coming. Be thankful that my lovers pay me. If not, where would you two be? Would you be able to eat three times a day? I'm telling you... If you get someone pregnant... Pregnant? But I always... You can get anyone pregnant at your age. I will disown you! I used protection. What protection? I knew it. And you! Give her another kiss! I heard you wanted to join a gang. What if something happens to either of you? What about me? You guys don't care. You guys want me to die lonely. You don't love me. You have no respect. You watch too much TV! So much drama. Comedy? It's getting late, children. Your parents might be looking for you. Yes, ma'am. Maybe you want to add some dessert? No, that would be all. So that would be... Chicken and spaghetti... Fries... A coke. Would that be for here or for takeout? Takeout. It's hot outside. What's the rush, Miss? Maybe you could just eat it here. Dude. Did you see that? That's why your brother is my idol. Has he always been that suave? Since you know when. Now they call him... "Smooth Operator." We really have to get it done! The sooner, the better. Let's just go next week. Pao? Dude... Wait... Aren't you forgetting about our plan? With Shiara? Thought you were in? Oh yeah. Forgot about that. Ghost hunting, right? Does she even know you're going? Well... Not yet... Look. Behind you. Here's your chance. Mimaw! What are you doing here? Getting ice cream...? It's killer outside. We're having a sleepover tomorrow. Wanna come? Maybe, sure. Hey, Shiara... Want some ice cream? So did Mimaw tell you? About what? That we're going to the cemetery. Oh yeah. Ghost hunting, right? Yeah. Nice, nice. It might be dangerous if... it's just us girls... Well... If you want... me... and the guys... can come with you. Yes. That's great. When is it good to go? Well... I heard that the best time to go is... like on a Good Friday... Or something... Right! That's what my grandma used to say too. Yeah. Not sure where I heard it from... Okay. Perfect. So wait... That's like in two weeks! Dude! Paolo, my man. This guy's da man. What can I get for ya? Two ice creams. Two ice creams, huh...? Paolo? I'll go ahead. Church meeting? Yeah. Are you going every Friday? Father Patrick put me in charge of the Holy Week procession. So Mommy's gonna be a bit busy. Good for you, Ma. So how long are these meetings? I dunno, it depends. Normally it's just from six to eight, but there's so much to do. You'll do great, Ma. Thanks, sweetheart. I'll probably stay an extra hour or two. So don't stay up. Just go to bed. We talked about this. Yes, Ma. Bye. Lina! I'm leaving. You got it. Using my Island Saga... and Forrest Mana... to activate Seacoast Drake. Let's see... I will evolve my Beetleform Maige, so I can use my aerial maneuver. Don't do it. I still don't get it. Dude. It's easy. Do you see this... Tenacious Dead? I'm gonna use all its attacks using my Frost Breath. That's it. Frost Breath. Like your bad breath. Frost Breath. Hey, manboobs! Why don't you make yourself useful and fetch me back the ball? Dude, dude. Don't mind him. Let me go! Why don't you tell your little dark friend to calm the fuck down? Take it easy! This is a basketball court. Unless you nerds can do threeonthree and are willing to bet money, you don't have any business hanging around here. So what's it gonna be? We had a chance to beat them at basketball. I've been practicing my Jordan moves. Really? You have no money to bet, Kachi. Bet? What about those? You could've bet those shoes, man. Besides, I could win for us. But you don't have Nikes, Kachi. If I had those shoes, I would bet them for you guys. My mom would freak out if something happens to my shoes. I'm sure I'll be grounded forever. Grounded forever? But you're sneaking out on Good Friday for your precious ghost hunting trip. You know they're too big, right? There's no way we could've won. Yeah. My shoes wouldn't fit them. Fine. Call me puny. Dark... And you know I don't have any money... But remember this... I'm not a coward. Gilligan is such a dick. No offense, Mimaw, I know he's your brother. But he's so annoying sometimes. Tell me about it. I have to live with him. And what about Kachi? Why do they even hang out with him? He's just so... ghetto. Yeah. He kind of looks like... a monkey, right? He acts like one, too. He climbs that tree by his house like a pro. One time, he really had to take a dump. Couldn't hold it anymore, so he just dug up a hole in the field and went. Ewwww!!!!! Yeah, he's a badass though. And his brother's kinda cute. He's such a playboy though. But do you know... who I think is also cute and kinda nice? Paolo. What do you think of him, Mimaw? I dunno. He's ok, I guess. Wow. You totally like him. I do not! Okay. I have an idea. You're Badong's little brother, right? Yup. Get us some gin from the store, would you? Okay. They know about it. Just ask for some gin. Hey... They're asking for some gin. Come over here and sit. How's Badongski? He's okay. Is he happy with his job? Tell him... that Bong and I have a job for him. He could be making a lot more with us. Really? How much more? A lot more. You know how to smoke, huh. You still in school? If anyone messes with you, if you get into trouble, you know who to call. But... you better get home. Your mom might find out you're here. She'll lose her shit. Nah. Fuck that. No, kid. This talk is for grownups. You're not allowed here yet. Go home, kiddo. Go home, big boy. Take care of yourself. Say hi to Badong. This one's big. That's a long one. Nice! Here on the side. Well, well, well... Look who we have here. Nice outfit. What's the special occasion? You gonna dance? Skimping on clothes today, huh, Mimaw? She's so thrifty on clothing, she's got double aircon underwear! It's that hot, huh? Mimaw! C'mon, we're just kidding. Don't mind them. They're just not used to... seeing you look like... a girl... No, I mean... Like a girly girl... A pretty girl. Whatever. Bunch of morons. What's the matter, Mims? C'mon, sis! You know we're just joking. Here. I bought you some White Rabbit. Your favorite. Check this out. Big one, isn't it? I'll fight that. Feeling brave? Let's go! Hurry. Jeez, Mims. You didn't have to put pants back on, you know. I know. Don't pay attention to your brother and Kachi. I don't care what they think. I just don't want to get it dirty. I just borrowed it from Shiara. Wow! You guys are getting pretty close, huh? I guess. Did she ever say anything about me? Dude... Why the heck would she? I don't know. Why are you so obsessed with her? Jeez, relax Mimaw! Just curious. Maw? What day is it? Palm Sunday. Oh shit... Yeah, yeah... Only five more days til your precious cemetery trip with Shiara... No, it's not that. My mom. I'm gonna be late for church. See ya. Look not upon our sins but on the faith of your Church and grant us the peace and unity according to your... If we weren't so late, Mrs. Tiongson wouldn't have taken our front row spot. Amen. May the peace of our Lord be with you all. And also with you. Let us offer each other the sign of peace. Peace be with you. Lord Jesus Christ Who said to your disciples: I leave you peace, my peace I give you. The Body of Christ. Amen. The Body of Christ. Amen. The Body of Christ. Amen. The Body of Christ... The Body of Christ... The Body of Christ. Amen. Hi, Paolo! Come on, let's go home. Yes! Boys! Keep it down! Holy Week has started. You shouldn't be having fun. And it's getting late. Start heading home. You guys ready for Friday? I saw her today. At church. Oh yeah? Is she still game? I didn't get to talk to her. But I think so, yeah. Well... That's settled. We'll go there on Friday night. Then... What if we don't find anything? We'll just leave you two to make out. Just... make sure... you make it to at least second base so it's not a total waste of our time. A kiss where? On the balls. Boys! What did I say about merriment during Holy Week? Mrs. Ortega... We're sorry. We're heading out now. Let's go. Those friends of yours. Rude! Did you pick your sacrifice for the week? I think you should sacrifice playing Nintendo. I think I should make a sacrifice this week, too. I've been so preoccupied with church meetings lately. Maybe you and I should spend more quality time together. The procession I've been organizing is tomorrow. After that, I shouldn't be going to any more late meetings. So you're not coming home late this Friday? Not anymore. I'll just make us a nice dinner. What do you say, Pao? Pao. Sure, Mom... Fun. It's a date. Go get ready for bed. Brush your teeth. Goodnight. Thy anger prevails. Thou shall follow my orders. Jesus shall be flogged, that your conscience shall rest. Soldier! Tie him to the column. Scourge Him 39 times. No more, no less. One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eleven, twelve! Thirteen, fourteen. Fifteen, sixteen. Seventeen, eighteen. I got the candles. You ready, dude? Big day for you. That's not happening anymore. My mom... she's not going anywhere tonight. Son of a bitch! Sorry, Maw. You even bought candles. It's ok. I didn't buy them. I just found them lying around the house. Why don't you just sneak out? Yeah, just go! You know how my mom is. I don't understand why these guys agree to hurt themselves. That shit must hurt. Because... They think they deserve it. What the hell? You're making me dizzy. You dancing or something? Why can't you hang out in your own room? I'm busy. Ouch! Hang on, my slippers! Hello, Lina? Where's Paolo? Pao! Pao, telephone! Stop sulking. Next week you can see them again. Alright then. I'll be in the kitchen. Pao, I got it! Got what? I got my mom to go to your house to do a rosary vigil with your mom. Then we can sneak out and still go ghosthunting! Are you crazy?! I mean... there's no use. I don't even think Shiara will show up. Did you tell her it's canceled? No. I forgot. Besides... I don't have her phone number. Dumbass!! What if she shows up and you're not there? She'll totally hate you. Do you want that? Of course not... Of course you don't. So stop being a doofus. Just man up for once. Just go! My mom's a talker. Your mom won't even notice you're gone. We'll be out two hours tops. Just tell her you're going to bed early. Okay? Paolo? Fine, ok. See ya. Maribel might arrive soon. She called and wanted to do a rosary vigil. She hasn't called me in months. Last I heard... Her husband flew to the States with another woman. Ma... I'm pretty tired. I think I should go to bed early. Why? Are you sick? No, Ma. Just tired. Say hi to Tita Maribel for me. Okay. Fine. Paolo... I know I said we should spend more time together. But Maribel... She never really comes over unless something is really wrong. Perhaps I can help her. I know you can, Ma. I'll leave you two to girl talk. Hi! Come in, come in! Thank you. Lina! The juice! So, what's been going on with you? I know. Where do I even start? I have so much to tell you. Hurry up! Paolo! Oh, tell me about it. Oh, that's a long story. Oh, just leave him there... There where? Sometimes, he calls... You dick! I got you good! The fuck? What are you doing here? Sup fags The hell are you doing here? He's with me. Well? Are we going to do this or what? C'mon! What do you think? They've been dating this whole time? Nah, dude. Maybe he's just trying to score. To score? Yeah. Dude. So you might still have a chance... Right? So what's the plan? Where are we gonna find your Manananggal? Hey, Shiara! What do you think? The Manananggal's body is stashed over there? Yeah! You might be right! Let's go. This way. Hey, Paolo... Thanks for this. I know your friends think this is stupid... Don't worry about them. Let's prove them wrong. Over there! Don't be scared. I'm right here with you. What if it's flying above us? I don't think so. Quick! Where's the salt? Mimaw! Did you bring the salt? Here. Oh. Just a bunch of dead flowers. That was a doozy. So there's no Manananggal after all. It was so scary... I thought I was going to see one for real. It's just so disappointing... Hey, Paolo! So Shiara... Are you dating this clown? What's it to you... dickweed? Don't, dude. Not worth it. Oh my god! Hey! Hey! My god! Cut it out! Holy shit! You're uncircumcised! C'mon. Let's go. Wimp! What was that?? I'm such an idiot. Sorry, but... maybe she's not the right one for you. After all my plans for her... Everything is wasted... Not everything... What are you doing? Hey! Son of a... it's late! A bunch of horny hooligans, aren't you? You. And you. Do your parents know where you are? Weren't you given a lecture on premarital sex? One wrong move... You'll get knocked up! Do you know how hard it is to raise a child in this economy? You don't have any respect for the dead. How old are you? You? Kachi. I called your brother Badong. He's on his way. What about you? How are you gonna go home? Kuya Johnny, can you give us a ride? Give you a ride... Thank you, Kuya Johnny. No problem, Ma'am. Why don't you have some coffee first? No, it's quite alright. Thank you. I'll be heading back. Thanks again. Badong! There he is. Go ahead. Go home. What? Go home. Badong. How are ya? Pao... It's almost noon. Your mom is already making lunch downstairs. Why don't you go shower? Is she still mad? Yup. What were you doing out last night anyway? You sneaked out so late. It's so unlike you. I don't know, Nanny. Maybe... when you told me about Manananggals... I got curious. Oh no, Pao. Don't believe in every little word that I say. You're not gonna tell your mom you got that idea from me, are you? Don't worry. I won't tell her anything. Besides... I didn't get the idea from you. I got this idea... from... Who? From a friend... a girl... Oh! You're growing up so fast, my little pet. Getting so handsome! Let me see that nose! Let me smell. You already have BO! If I were you, I'd get up and shower. Your mom's gonna kill me if I don't get you down there by lunch. There. Go shower now. I can still see you. With my third eye. Pao. I don't know what the hell has gotten into you, Paolo. I was worried sick. And placing those pillows on the bed! What do you take me for? Do you think I'm stupid? I knew what you were up to. I know about the girl at church. I know all about your stupid friends' plans. What? You think I had no idea? I know everything. From now on... You are never to see those... those hooligans again. And forget about your Nintendo too. I spent a fortune on those. On your shoes. On all your needs. Everything you ask for. And for what? You just throw it all away just to make out with some bimbo! You're just like your father! You are not real men. Where the hell do you think you're going? Pao! Let him go, Lina. He's not welcome here. Let him run off to wherever he wants. Kachi, turn on the fan. What's wrong? It's already plugged in. This motherfucking volcano! It's screwing up my life. It's so fucking hot! Goddamn it! I'm so sick of these brownouts! Look. Our neighbors have power. What? Listen. Their radio is on. Is it just us? Son of a... Meralco... Salvador... What? Did you pay the electric bill? Oh, I thought you were taking care of it this month? If you only put our family's needs first instead of blowing your salary on your stanky hoes and your fucking hair gel... we wouldn't be having problems! Dang, ok, sorry, Ma! I get paid on Monday... You're gonna make me wait until Monday? Are you serious? Stop being dramatic. You're lucky to have me as your mom. Here. What's this? Merthiolate. You left it at my altar. You piece of shit! It's so humid. That's it! I'm taking off my bra! I'm going nude! What else is new? Pack your bags. Why? Where are we going? To Mang Pido. Right now? Yeah. Let's go. Hey, Kachi. Where do you think you're going? Out! Let's go. Let's go. Shit! We're totally doing it! Ok... Lemme pack... Where are you? Ok, ok... Dude... What should I tell my mom? Ok, ok... Shit! What about Mimaw? Ok, got it. Just give me a minute, fuckwads! Bye. Nice. So you're finally doing it, huh? What the fuck, Mimaw! You scared the shit out of me! Foolish boys. Just pack your stuff. I'll take care of Mom. You're not coming? Nah. I don't need to be there. Maw! Do you like the color? It's ok... You have a much bigger closet now. I'm throwing away all your torn and muddied clothes. Okay? Ma, not Oscar! Not him. That's your favorite, huh? I remember when you were four or five and you were being grumpy or things don't go your way I'd just say... "Oscar, have you seen Mimaw?" Fine, you can have him. I won't throw him out. Thanks. Ma... Yes? How come you didn't get me Barbies when I was little? Honey, I did. Don't you remember? You ripped their heads off. Really? Then your dad and I tried enrolling you in ballet classes. You kept sneaking out. Your tutu was covered with mud. And we found you in the field wrestling some kids for the soccer ball. But your dad... He didn't care if you liked sports or not. Know why? Why? Because he found someone new to play with. But you know... Honey... I really loved your dad. But the thing is... That's the problem... I loved him too much, and I didn't leave anything for myself. Well... You've got us. I know... I'm sorry. I shouldn't be saying all these things to you. It's just... I don't... I don't want to lose both of you. It's ok, Ma. Don't worry. That won't happen. Only thing is... what if I need to see what's out there for me too, you know? What made you say that? Sigh, Melissa... You're growing up too fast. It's... You talk like a wise old man. Is that so? I know too much? Uhuh Speaking of... I'm glad that you're talking to Tita Patricia again. I like her. She even invited us to sleep over at her house tonight. She did? That's nice. We should definitely chat more often. Cool. I'm just gonna buy another one. Sure, sure. Do you want one? No, thanks. Go ahead. I have stuff to do. Okay. What the... I took care of it. You're the best, Mims! You're sure you don't wanna come? You know how to get there? Of course. No biggie. Got money? You know you have to cover Kachi. I got him. Maw, I'll go ahead. Take care. Here's the plan. You wait here. Okay. Hey. Hey. So you're really gonna do it? Yep. It's time. You should come with us. No. I really shouldn't. Maw... If it's because of last night... I didn't mean to... I don't want to talk about it. Just go, don't worry about me. Just don't be stupid. And take care of yourselves. That's the thing... We are stupid. If you're not there, everything just falls apart. C'mon. It won't be the same without you. Wait. I was only able to bring underwear. Dude... It's Mang Pido! Mang Pido! Are you Mang Pido? No? Where can we find him? Alright. Thanks! Look down there, dude Let's do it. Boys. Don't let any of the girls see that. Might get swollen. Where's my bolo... Scared you real good, huh! Don't worry. Your little birdies don't need a big knife. I have here a tiny razor for your tiny birdies. The good thing is I'm quick. When I count to three... chew on the guava leaves. Then I chop. Then you spit out the leaves and I wrap it around your bird. Got it? You boys must be really good friends for wanting to do this together. And right when the volcano's about to erupt. SON OF A BITCH!!! How'd it go? Everything ok? You all look like shit. Hey... Want me to buy food or aspirin? Let me. Maw! Easy, easy... My wound's right there... We're good. Why don't you just leave us alone for a minute? Please? Please, Mimaw. Move. Hey! I don't have much space here either. It's like the pictures dad sends us from Minneapolis. I wonder when we'll get to see real snow. Why? Do you want to? Dunno... Maybe. It's kinda far. I'm pretty happy here. So was it worth it? Do you feel like a real man now? Gosh, sis. It hurts like hell. What were you guys thinking? I don't know why we have to go through these things. I think I'm different... But I feel the same. You know... I wonder what mom's gonna say. "It's for the best." You got it? Ouch. Happy Easter, Ma. Happy Easter, Paolo. You hungry? What do you wanna eat? Spam? Bacon? It's okay, Ma. I just need some rest. We need to clean it so it won't get infected. Ma, no... It's fine. I can do it. I can do it myself. Of course. Of course, son. Give it to me. Does it hurt? Paolo! Pao! Pao! Paolo! Hi, auntie... Happy Easter! Paolo is grounded. What now? You'll have to eat the cake in here. Nice! Wait! Hurry! Ouch! Hold up. Let me go in first. Wait. Get off, Mimaw. Son of a bitch! Guillermo! Language! Let's get this fucker! Kachi! Go, finish it! Faster! He's about to die! Faster! Wait, wait! Yes! We finally beat this stupid game! Alright, let's try a new one, quick! Huh? Go get another one. So who are you dating now, Gil? Still Aimee? Aimee? Denise now, right? Nah. Denise and I just broke up. You know Annie? She's the one I'm trying to get with now. Damn. You did learn something from Badong. True. As long as... you don't end up like him. In the end... he got Jen pregnant. Damn. That sucks. Let's eat. Okay. Dude... How's the new Sega? It's alright. Wanna borrow it? Nah, I'm good. Well then... Where's Mimaw? Mimaw... Got everything you need? Well, not everything... Obviously. Okay. Let's go? You go ahead, Ma. Be right there. Okay. No, no. Michael Jordan. How does that go? Sis. You think you could leave without saying goodbye? Jeez.. I know you'll miss me. Take care of Ma, okay? Hey! Mimaw. Take care, okay? Keep in touch. I'll get that for you. It's ok. I got it. Well... Take care of yourself. Of course. You too. Mimaw, let's go. Gilligan, you're in charge here, ok? Ready, honey? Wanna play ball or what ? Nah. Don't wanna mess up my hair gel. Yeah. I've gotta be fresh for my date later. What the...?
