I've had better fights... with young maidens. Ho, ho, ho, is that so, my friend? A man like this my friends. Had best forget about maidens. Until he's learned to fight a man. This is just getting better, yes. Next time, get me someone who doesn't need a rest in the middle of a fight. Come on. You cheated anyway. You kicked my weapon away. You don't get to be a hero, my friend, playing by the rules, eh, Amatron? Good match, Pyron. - Thank you. - Yes. So... Well what we here, Amatron? A little chicken, huh? You want to plant barley. This is going to be a terrible year for oats. Next prophecy. I wonder where that girl went. You gonna follow me everywhere, my friends? You said you were gonna teach us to fight. So I did, Amatron, so I did. Go now. What do you have to talk to that old buzzard about? Oh, he gets around. One village one day, one the next. He knows where the poor ones are. He also knows where the rich ones are. I saved his neck once. We've been helping each other out ever since. Listen my friend, do you want to learn how to fight? Yeah. First, learn to tell what's worth fighting for. Now, give me that. Thank you. I'll have a few words for you. But... I must attend to this lady first. Some wizards get all the luck. This way please. I've searched three years for you. Thinking I was the end of your quest? You are not the first. But I'm the only one who has this. And you have the other. No. I wish I did. Do you understand what will happen when the two stones are united? Yes. Will you use its power for good? I swear it. Far... to the south. Alive if you can. Dead if you have to. I thought I'd got away from them. They haven’t caught you yet my friend. Out of the way. I'm sorry, the wizard's busy. Come back tomorrow. Get him. Die. Nicias, stay close to me. I can take care of myself. Protect the girl. Get the wizard. Heavens! Nicias! Grab the girl. - Hey, hey, hey. - Stay away from me. Nicias told me to take care of you. What do those cutthroats want with him anyway? All right, go on back. I'm sure there's one or two of those soldiers left who'd like to get his hands on you. Have you ever heard of a secret city? A city built all of treasure? - In my dreams, yes. - It's real. Nicias was born there. He's the last of his people. The secret city is called Arandor... and It's protected by magic. And he told you how to find it? Well, not exactly. He did or he didn't? Well, we got to find Nicias then. You will help me? A whole city... diamonds, crystal, gold. Enough to make my people strong forever. Oh, your people. Don't tell me you're a princess. Yes. Why is it that I keep getting mixed up with princesses? Don't get me wrong, your... you're very nice, and quite lovely. But here I go again, riding hundreds of miles. Fighting whole armies, up against magic maybe. In the end, all I'll get is flowers on my head and everyone telling me how wonderful I am. Why don't they ever just skip the speeches and give me the treasure? Is that all you're after? That, and Nicias. When someone's brave enough to call an outlaw a friend, you don't walk away from him when he's in trouble. Treasure's a good excuse though. I've got the warmest blankets over here. I'll be warm enough. Thank you. What brought a princess on a quest like this anyway? It was either me or my sister. And she can't even put on her own shoes. We have no soldiers. We don't even have a home, like Nicias. Tents in the forests, in the mountains. When I find that city... Yes. You're sure you don't want to try one of my blankets? Well, I never saw a princess yet who liked to sleep alone. - Blanket, my little one? - They're here! Who sent you here? It's okay. Where's the damn wizard when we need him, huh? It's not him we need. There's a warlord, in the south... with a magic stone, like this. The two stones together hold the secret of the city. Nicias gave this to you? The soldiers thought he had it, but it's mine. It's always been mine. We will find that city, won't we? Yes, we'll find it. I'll find it... I'll find it. - Let me go! - Hold still. We want the man who killed her. Deathstalker didn't kill her. So there is such a man as Deathstalker. I thought he was a myth. He didn't kill her. Get out. Now we've got a legend to catch. The girl dead. The wizard, taken. Magic... they said he did it by magic. Magic? Nicias? He couldn't light a fire with a torch. I want that man. You won't rule us forever, Troxartas. Of course I will. Aren't you rich enough without one more jewel? Rich enough? You own every inch of land and every peasant between here and the sea. And me. If you ever notice. This has nothing to do with being rich. Many people have searched for the treasure city. And if the fools ever found it, they couldn't comprehend what they had. Smooth talker, wasn't he? That city is power. The magic of a thousand generations lives in the stones of its walls. Waiting to erupt for the one who puts this together. Everything from here to the sea. When this is complete... the world is mine. With this... I’ll live forever. Why does it have to be so hot? We've come a long way south. Yes, we have. Is it going to be this hot where I'm going to live? You have servants to comfort you with fans, and to bring you cool drinks. Yes... lots of servants. What do you want? Forgive me. I must have made a mistake. Who's the girl? She's from the north. She's on her way to marry somebody. Lucky man, here, let me help you with that. Looks like a girl I once knew. Lucky you. You think we'll get any further tomorrow than we did today? Wherever you're goin', it'll still be there when you get there. - What's going on? - I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. We're looking for a bandit. I haven't seen anybody. Sure. Shh, shh, I need your help. Try that again, I'll cut your throat. Good girl. Who's in there? A lady. I'll have to take a look. Let me wake her up, I don't want her frightened by a stranger. Alright, she's awake. Sorry to disturb you, my lady. I didn't tell. Why are you staring at me? You look like someone I knew. - It could have been your sister. - My sister died... long ago. Help! Help! Get him, get him. Get him, he's the one you're after. Surprise, ha-ha. A purse of gold to the man who finds him. Deathstalker... You can hide from ordinary men... but not from me. Far greater warriors have given their lives to me. Let him stand against them. You... the leader of a thousand men. You thought you would conquer me. Now you'll do my bidding. And you. And you, who could hurl boulders off the mountain tops. An army of the dead in my power. I, who took your lives... Give them back to you. Rise. There are still limits to your strength. I will find the strength. Not until you find the second stone. The world, is almost in my grasp. One man is not going to stop me. They'll never catch me now. You and me will get along just fine. Those are my horses. Get down off him. Forgive me. I'm, really in a hurry. Thought you could outrun an old woman. My daughter shoots pretty good too, don't she? Excellent. Excellent shot. If there's one thing I've always admired, it's... It's-- We don't appreciate horse thieves. Horse thieves. No, a little gold maybe. A jewel here and there, but never a horse. Drop your sword. I'd be more than happy to pay for him. What other weapons do you have? A knife? No knife. Money's a little tight at the moment. But I think we can work something out. Search him. No knife. I've seen your kind before. I haven't. Don't move! I thought you didn't have any money? This is nothing. There's thousands more where this came from. Tell you what. You let me borrow a horse, I'll come back with a handful of these. Bigger ones too. You spend the night here. No, I really am in a hurry. Oh, you'd kill yourself trying to ride out of these canyons in the dark. The people who are after you, can't get in very easy. I'll lend you a horse in the morning. Thank you. You sleep outside. You boil a hell of a potato. And there'll be more for breakfast. Perhaps in the morning I can catch you a rabbit. You want to eat a rabbit? Potatoes are what we eat. Just a wild idea. Thank you. Would you like another potato? Thank you. You sleep in the barn. Over there. Thank you very much. There's only one thing a man like that wants. Careful. Oh... no. What did you do with my daughter? I'm looking for an outlaw. Yeah, so am I. He knows where the horses are. Marinda, you can't come with me. But you can't get through these hills without me. I've got to try. But they'll catch you. I don't want them to catch you. I have to see what it's like beyond this valley. What are you waiting for? That's the only way out. You're the only man I ever kissed. - Take me with you. - I Can't. If you ride out of these mountains, you'll leave your innocence behind. I believe that's the first time I ever told a girl to hang onto her innocence. - Will you ever come back? - I can. Damn you, come back. This is all your fault. Well, well, well. If my bodyguards were here, you wouldn't be smiling. Call them then. They're dead. Those idiot soldiers. When they couldn't catch you... They came back and accused everyone of protecting you. Just who exactly are you anyway? That's none of your business. Your right. You're absolutely right. I am the Princess Elizena. I'm on my way to marry a very important man. Is that so? You never even introduced yourself. Forgive me. Deathstalker. You've heard of me, huh? Don't you touch me. Ah, do I look like I’m about to hurt anybody? I'm just a simple hero trying to eat his dinner. People talk too much. You know that? Just because a man's a little... faster with a sword. A little... better with a horse, a little stronger. A little more handsome, brave, daring... - irresistible to women. - Not all women. You see what I mean? I have no idea how these legends get started, you know? Very Close. What is? The stone. The other half of the stone. I can feel its power growing. The two halves. They're coming together. Live! Live! Live, all of you! Live! Live! Your quest begins. Well, I guess we're not gonna go to bed after all, are we? The princess will be here in a day or two. She means nothing, you know that. - Your going to marry her. - You're too romantic. - If the girl has the stone-- - You thought her sister had the stone. Now your soldiers think Deathstalker's got it. Whoever has it, I need to get it! If the girl has the stone, I'll take it... And that's the end of her. And if she doesn't have it... I'll deal with Deathstalker. And you'll just throw her away? Will you throw me away, when you get tired of me too? Don't I give you everything you want? Not everything. That was my sister's. You told me your sister died a long time ago. You killed her. I did not kill her. She gave it to me. Now, what do you know about this? I'm not telling you anything. We must be getting close to the other one. Where did your sister get it? Where did your sister get it? She got it from our father before he died. We were little girls. Now leave me alone. I'm on your side. I am on your side. Everybody thinks it's easy being a princess. What about seeing your people being killed? What about having to walk through the mud and the sun to marry a man you never even met? I mean, where's all the glamor in that? I don't wanna marry a man I never met. Who do you want to marry? Not you. If I marry Troxartas, he'll leave my people alone. It doesn't matter if I don't love him or not. Maybe this Troxartas will turn out to be the handsome prince you've always dreamed of. You think he'll be handsome? Princes are bred for it. Even if he is... that's not the way love's supposed to happen. Nothing better after you've robbed a village than a nice woman. Bocket. Bocket, Bocket. A village under my protection was attacked yesterday. No, sir, it wasn't us. I have trouble enough with the peasants without you causing any more. You'll come with me to my castle. There was this awful man. And he attacked me, and I've been traveling such a long way. - And then, and then these-- - And you are called? The Princess Elizena. So, I've found my lost bride at last. Troxartas. She'll ride your horse. Back to the castle. First, lets get you cleaned up. Just a little something to eat, please. When Troxartas gives an order, you learn to obey it. Into the tub. I think I miss a bath, even more than I miss food. Are you my husbands servant, or will you be mine as well? Just his. I'll have to get a servant. Until then... wash my back, would you? She didn't have so much as a bracelet, let alone a magic stone. Camisarde... you wouldn't keep it for yourself, would ya? Why? The stone's what you want. And you're what I want. - Go in there, and get her dressed. - In what? She only has those rags she came in. Give her something of yours then. Something beautiful and soft. So you can go to bed with her? Yes. Now do as you're told. You'll ride out at dawn. I thought you said the girl had the stone. She didn't. He's out there... somewhere. The way I look at it. A man kills you, he oughta leave you dead. - I owe him nothing. - Your life. I could go for a woman like that, eh. Watch out soldier, she's death. death? You guys want to sleep with my wife? I like a woman like you. No sense of humor. Deathstalker. Oh, I'm sure we've met, I can't quite recall the name. Troxartas. This is my home. Ah. I'd like to talk to you. That's very kind. I was just on my way in for a little dinner. - But, maybe later. - I think now. I always like a nice conversation before dinner. Nice place you've got here. Let's not waste one another's time, Deathstalker. I saw a scar on the man's face downstairs. I put that scar there, must be, oh, five years ago. Thank you. When I left him, he was quite dead. Now here he is, drinking wine and chasing women. Where's the stone, Deathstalker? Last time I saw the stone, Nicias had it. Then he got grabbed by some soldiers. You wouldn't by any chance know whose soldiers they are, would you? Come in. I believe you've met my future bride. Oh, yes, yes. Lovely outfit. I understand you killed her sister. No. No, it's you men who get the credit for that. Now, why would they-- To keep her from finding Nicias I suppose. They got there too late, Troxartas. She found me. And now you're here to kill me for this? But it won't work. I wouldn't. The stone. You finally caught him, didn't you? - Let me finish him! - Not on my carpet, you idiot. There's a third stone. It'll be much easier for you if you talk. About what? He's got both the stones. The third stone. What third stone? Nicias! Oh, Nicias. That crafty old trickster, yes. I'll tell you what, you untie my hands. And I'll find him and wring his neck for you. Stop pretending you don't know where he is. It will be much easier for you and for him. And me. Troxartas wants to know where the third stone is, and I mean to be the one who finds it for him. Instead of all of those barbarians downstairs. You are much too beautiful a woman for the likes of him. Do you think I'm beautiful? Oh, the face of an angel. And I'm very intelligent too. I invented these. I'm actually quite proud of them. He really doesn't appreciate me, you know? Oh, God. You will tell me where the wizard is. Not even if I knew. I knew a man like you once. He was wonderfully handsome, and strong, and brave. He lasted almost a week. You will tell me where the wizard is. Won't you? It'd be such a shame to spoil that beautiful face of yours. Oh, it's your face I can't stop thinking about. Don't change the subject. I'm going to count to five. One. What on Earth would he want with another woman when he's got you? Three. What happened to two? I'm losing my patience with you. Four. It's not going to be very long before she's got him tying you up in here. He's going to kill her when he gets what he wants. Five. I wish I was the kind of man who could kill a woman. Nicias? I think so. Guard. I'm under a spell. I can no more talk about the third stone than I can bite my own teeth. You claim to be a magician. Break the spell. Don't you think I've tried? Do you think I prefer going from village to village, year after long year, forecasting the health of goats? That's no life for a man my age. Who cast the spell? We'll find them. He's long dead. You can torture me if you like. I'll scream, but I won't be able to talk. If you want to kill me... go ahead. I don't have very much to live for, really. The goats will be happy. No matter whether I visit them. I will find that stone. If your magic isn't strong enough... Mine will be. I thought you were one of them. What are you doing here? I followed you. You may be sorry, little one. You may be sorry. Stay here, alright? Who are you? Smelled your food. You really don't think I'd be foolish enough to walk in here without men to back me up, do you? You think we'd fall for that old line? I know you. I thought it was you back at the castle. This is the only man who ever bested me in a fight. And it was a fair fight too. Here, eat. No, no, thank you. You go right ahead. Bring your men down here. You're always a good judge of men, Deathstalker. You know, Gragas, I could have sworn I killed you in that fight. You did, you did. - I did? - Yeah. Oh, that-that explains everything. We were all killed one way or another. Mostly by Troxartas. You mean you're all dead? Uh-huh. The magic of Troxartas brought us back. It's not so bad. You know, for some of us, it's like a second chance at life. But some of the others though, they've been dead for a long time. And they liked it that way. It's not so much fun for them. We walk only to serve Troxartas. Right now he's got us looking for some damn wizard. And for you too, Deathstalker. You know, Makut's men caught the wizard. Why did they not tell us? I don't think he's very fond of you guys. Nor we of them. Nor their master. Well then, if you're as tired of Troxartas as I am, perhaps together we could-- No, we couldn't. He owns our souls. Yeah, he's got 'em sealed up in a jar back at the castle. And while he's got 'em, we're forced to do his bidding. I can get you that jar. If that were possible. We must obey Troxartas. Deathstalker! What about the girl? She is of no concern to us. May I speak with her then? I won't let them take you. - I'll fight them. - Shh. You always show up just when I need you. I need you alive though. Now go find Pyron. Tell him... Tell him, to gather the people outside the walls of the castle. And wait for my signal. All right? Go. I hope it's not too late to discuss this. You're certain he didn't have it on him? Yes, lord. Put the body in the crypt. I'll deal with it later. Nicias, I never understood... ...what you saw in Deathstalker. Perhaps he'll do me better service in my new army. I'm glad they killed you. That's not a nice thing to say to an old friend. Help! Surprised are you, huh? You killed my sister. For the last time, I did not kill your sister. But you're about to marry the man who did. - You're a liar. - And you're in love. You'd fall in love with any man who'd give you a hot meal and perfumed bath water. He's probably going to kill you next. He's gonna marry me. Why don't you take me to Nicias. He'll tell you the truth. I'll take you to Troxartas. You know, Carissa was worth 10 of you. - He tied me up. - Not now. Haven't you wondered where I've been? - Deathstalker, he-- - Not now. I was there all night. By myself! Not now, my magic's working. Deathstalker, gone. Elizena, a few hours of life left. When I've found the third stone no power in the world will stand against me. Talk! Perhaps I’d even let you bring Elizena in and let you kill her yourself. You would like that wouldn't you. Talk! Don't be dead. Please don't be dead. I need your help. Deathstalker. He's going to kill me. You were telling the truth. I didn't want to believe you. So, now you come running to me for help. Please, he's going to kill me. Oh, come now, the dashing prince? The love of your life? I was wrong. Oh, yeah. Can't a person be wrong? Please. Take me to Nicias. To great times! And to great friends! Music. - Gragas. - Have you done it? Yea, I'm working on it. But could you hang onto something for me for a minute? You know what that is? I just got a second chance at life, and I doubt if I'll ever get a third. All you're entitled to is one. Just keep her safe for a few minutes, I'll be back. You'd better keep your promise. Just send one of your men out to the tower in about 10 minutes. I'll signal from there that your souls are free. Oh, so I see. You like your women death, too? Gone... A kingdom fallen. The first stone... lost. The second stone... Carissa. The third... - Hidden. - Where? The castle. The tower. The tower? I hid the stone in-- Yes, yes, yes, where'd you hide it? Where you'll never find it. Troxartas. Guards, stop him. Nicias! Nicias, wake up. Oh dear. I hope I didn't say too much. You don't remember? Honestly, no. You better hang onto those. I'm afraid I didn't do a very good job. - It's time to go-- - No. I'm not sure I feel up to traveling again yet. Well then, don't open that door until I come back. Why do I have to do everything myself? Guards, take her! Move! This will be your last night. All of your souls will be mine. You're wrong, Troxartas. Free men decide their own fates. Stop them! - Obey me! - Not anymore. Lads, stop him. They mustn't reach Nicias. Take him. I believe you have something of mine. Deathstalker, no. Get him out of here! I will kill him. She can't hurt me. I've heard enough lies from you today, Nicias. If I cut, you will bleed. Just come and take her. You'll have to take me first. I got it Gragas. You move one step closer, and I will kill him. Well, she proved one thing. I'm human after all. You're not going to die. Deathstalker. Oh, my life wasn't worth yours little one. - I love you. - I love you. It is you who've earned... the right to put these together. Even this magic. Can't give me what I need. How does it show where the city of treasure is? All my life my people have dreamed of a kingdom of their own. Now we have one. Stay with me. And live in peace and prosperity? You told me once it's not easy being a princess. It's not easy being a hero either. Who knows, maybe there's another treasure city waiting for me out there. There isn't. Not that you've seen. Who knows. You know... I wouldn't really have killed you. I find you very attractive. Subtitles by DarwinDesign
