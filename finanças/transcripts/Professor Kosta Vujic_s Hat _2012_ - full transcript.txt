The hat on sight! Professor Kosta Vujic, according to his student, who was later a famous mathematician Mihailo Petrovic, also known as Mika Alas (fisherman), was the most original professor of 19th century. PROFESSOR VUJlC'S HAT People from Belgrade knew him by his hats, seven hats, one for each day of the week. This eccentric, loner and bachelor had acquired this brick for his eternal house a long time ago. He didn't have his own house so he moved every spring taking the brick along with him to his new home. From landlords he asked for something, at that time very demanding. A clean and arranged toilette. Thanks to that, toilettes in Belgrade were getting better and better. This classmate of Branko Radicevic in Karlovci and at studies in Vienna, had been teaching German in the First male high school for thirty years. At his time in Serbia, no government could be formed without his students. After these students of professor Vujic's last generation, many streets in Belgrade were named. What are you doing there children, for God's sake? We were sleeping. We're getting up. My God! Poor students from province. Why here, Serbian hopes? Why not? Neither we disturb the dead nor do they disturb us. The sun has warmed these tombstones and it feels good. l hope you are not sleeping here in winter. - No, in winter we are mostly at the lounge of the railway station. We stoke fire there and in return gendarmes let us sit by the stove. - Good gendarmes. There are many good people in Belgrade. Young Serbian hopes, let me take you to the inn to treat you. Good morning professor. Good afternoon, Mr Vujic. - Good afternoon. lnnkeepers are waiting for him as if he was bringing them good luck. To say hello to him and show some delicious meal they were preparing. He was the biggest gourmand of the Serbian capital. Mitrovic! - Good morning, teacher. What are you doing in front of the Minister Marinkovic's house? l was on my way to school when l met this interesting horse. Now you want to write a song about this interesting horse. A? Hurry to school or you will be late. This horse can't give you justification. Hurry! Mitrovic, wait, come here. Who put this rose here? - l don't know, Madam. lt's so beautiful. Was it her you were waiting for? Yes. She's pretty, very pretty. Write her a song. l've already published two songs for the newspapers. Does she know that they are devoted to her? No, she doesn't. - You dumb! What are you doing people? We're digging a hole. - l can see it. What for? For a momument to Prince Mihailo. - On a horse. ln which direction will he ride? - ln that one. To lstanbul? - Yes. The First male high school was in Kapetan Misa's building. ln front of the building - a market. The hat on sight! Sit down. The window! - Stop, don't move! Teacher, let us see how long he will make in that pose of the leaning tower in Pisa. Petrovic, you're making noise. Go in the corner! - He's absent. Cvijic, you go in the corner to substitute him until he comes. Why me, Sir? Paja Popovic is his best friend. - Because tsar's word is not denied and it doesn't matter where you are reading. Prodanovic, you're going to be a journalist, aren't you? Among other things. - Now you're in the right position. You want to spend your whole life between the newsroom and jail. Why do you say so? - Because you just can't keep your mouth shut. Donkey! -For that, l will be a journalist. Come in! Come in... Petrovic. Come in.. You're late for school. l'm not properly dressed, Sir. - That's why you will go to the corner. But, l'm not by myself. l'm here with a friend. Your friend will go to the corner too. All right than, Djole... Let's go to the corner. What's that, Petrovic? - A catfish, Sir. Bring it over here. What a big catfish you've caught! You told me if l caught a very big fish to bring it to school. How did you take it out, my big angler? Don't ask. l have been by the river all night. l am late for school but it was worth. What are you going to do with it? l don't know. Do you have an idea? Take it over to Dardaneli inn and tell them to put it on ice. l'll think something out later. You saw that? You did well with sending him to Dardaneli inn. - l certainly did. Better to Dardaneli than to the corner. lt would be crowded there. The corner couldn't take on so many catfish (dopes). To the corner, Popovic, to substitute the dope. Sit down. l'll show you what is what! l believe that even sparrows around the school are familiar with this. Does anybody want to solve this task? Or somebody wants to show how bad at maths he is. What smells so good? l have no idea, Sir. Silence. What's so funny? Well then, nobody knows how to solve this task. Do you want to try, Petrovic? Well, if l have to... You don't have to. - ln that case, l want to. l don't feel like writing the whole procedure. l'll write down just the result. Are you sure, Petrovic, check it. - l'm completely sure. You check it, Sir. Will you check it Sir? - lf l have to...- You don't have to. ln that case l want to. You haven't put the minus. - l don't need your help... Where? At the beginning. Very good. Here's your grade book Sir. Plato said that mathematics sharpens mind. Get away from here, rowdy! Stay away from the horse. l've been watching you for days fawning over the wrong horse. Let's go. - Where? - To find your way out. And where's my way out? - ln Knez Mihailo Riding Club. Why do you want to take me there? To help you become friends with Miss Marinkovic's horse. You are not naive. - Let's go. We should get some sugar first. What do we need the sugar for? - Horses like sugar. You're right. - Let's go.. Listen to this choir. l don't know you in this way, Cvijic. Here you can see me by my origin and inheritance. There l am what l am supposed to be by origin and inheritance. Let's go. Come closer, don't be afraid, he has smelled the sugar. Give him a lump of sugar. Now, whistle! Give him a lump again and whistle. You see, horses are very bribable. Do you want to take a ride? - May l? - l should ask first. Listen to me. Listen to me. Ministry of our army has sent these rifles to the students of your school. You can train in order to become good soldiers for your country. Take these rifles and get accustomed to them. Remember! This is Balkan. Are the rifles real? Why do you ask? Do you want dummy bullets? Take this rifle and shut up. Silence! Order! Knock it off! Listen! We've come here to train aiming at a target by shooting a rifle. Don't make me be ashamed of you in front of Lieutenant Misic who was in command of a battalion as a cadet and decorated with a gold order for bravery. Cvijic, l trust you. Fire! Well done, Cvijic. Lieutenant Misic, you see what hell of an eye he has. l agree. - Well done, Cvijic, well done. Velimir, take the rifle and kneel down. C'mon don't be scared. - Aim! Velimir, don't turn your head. Aim well and shoot the enemy. C'mon, don't let them shout at you. First aim and then shoot. You'll be anything but a soldier. Now the Austrians across the Danube are watching us rejoiced. Austrians! Watch this! Don't worry for your country. This one will not take it from you. But l will. Mr Vujic, have a seat, please. Has my student brought you a catfish? - Yes, it was ordered for one thirty. Will it be ready? - Yes, Sir. Good afternoon, Sir. - Good afternoon. There's our teacher here. We have finished our lesson of military training and our teacher is in the middle of his lunch. lt's because every lunch of our teacher is a gourmand tour around inns in the town. Good appetite, Sir. Bastille was a fortress with a horrible name. lt constantly jeopardized Paris having it at reach of its cannons. French kings were holding their French noblemen in that dungeon. Through centuries it became a symbol of tyranny in the middle of Paris. But on July 14th 1789 people took up arms...- Hurrah! And made a violent assault. - Let's do it! l can still hear sounds of drums and bugles. We can also hear them. We can hear them. They didn't feel sorry for their lives, they assaulted Bastille and destroyed it. People were happy in the streets, excited, rejoiced, hugging one another, crying of joy... The Bastille was down! Hurrah! - lt was a new date, a new great date in human history. A new epoch had started, an epoch of civil rights and national freedom that once and forever the French revolution had given to the mankind. Long live the French revolution! - Long live! Teacher! - Yes, Prodanovic? While you are inspiring us with ideas of the French revolution, close to here in the National theatre they are having a final rehearsal of a play. What play? Pavle Popovic will tell us more about the play. What's it about, Poppovic? - lt's Rabagas by Sardou. A disgrace that muddies all possessions of the modern revolution. Down with Rabagas! - Down! Who is Rabagas? Nusic! Brana! - What's going on? They want to perform "Rabagas" by Sardou. We won't allow it. We have to stop them. - Right! We mustn't allow this play that muddies the French revolution. - Right! They didn't allow this pamphlet in Paris, Prague and.... Popovic...- Pest. We will not let them show it here either! - Right! Students, let's gather tonight here to stop it by force. Let's do it! - Down with Rabagas! - Down! Police Minister Garasanin is getting upset. Let's go out to set an ambush for the police. Have you seen Branislav Nusic? He's in the hole for the moment. With lower grade students. What are you doing here in the hole? - We have set an ambush for the police. The police are involved? - Yes, Minister Garasanin has already sent for them. l was under his box in the theatre when l saw him sending for the police. Mr Vujic! Who is calling me? - lt's me, principal Milosavljevic. Come back later, l'm getting dressed. l wouldn't disturb you if it wasn't an urgent matter. Please. Wait a minute, please. Good morning, Sir. - lt's not good at all. You have heard what happened at the theatre last night. - No. You have no idea. - No. - You don't know that your students made a scene. My students? - Yes. - That's impossible. What do you mean impossible. This newspaper writes that your students prevented the showing of the theatrical performance by force. Of the "Rabagas"? - Yes. - l knew it. lt's not a big deal. Keep calm. How can you say that! lt's easy for you. You are not in trouble. lt's written here that l'd incited them to rebel. You know what it means. Concerning the student's demonstrations the decision of the legal authority is as follows: You are not punished. Your principle, however, got the worst of it. He has been dismissed. What's this, some kind of demonstrations? No way. We just wanted to wish you a warm welcome. Gentlemen, this is Mr Kozarac, our new principal. Let's welcome him with a big applause. lt's okay, thank you. You know that l'm coming from the town of Sabac. l helped them make order where it was necessary. The students are disciplined there now and they don't need me anymore. That's why they've sent me here. To make the First male high school the best. l ask for order, work, sweat and knowledge. Where there is order there is knowledge. What's your name? - Jakov Prodanovic. Yours? - Jovan Cvijic. Yours? - Mihailo Petrovic. - Yours? - Pavle Popovic. Yours? - Milorad Mitrovic. Your names will be noted and remembered. Excuse me, may we know where our names will be noted? ln my notebook. What did you think? ln history? Your class has to be put in order. l'm glad that there are many talented and smart students in my last class. We'll see how good they are at their final examination. That's not the point. We should talk about their behaviour. They are considered to be the least disciplined class in your school. You have to stop being indulgent. l know how hard it is for you to change your bad habits. l don't have any bad habits. Concerning our school, l give orders as long as l am the principal. Nothing, not even your stomach can interfere. l beg your pardon? - Are you angry, chum? l've got to go. Professor Mokranjac use us to conduct his experiments. - What do you mean? That is his collection of songs. He's now checking it. What is he writing? l don't know. He's making some changes in the song. We just learn the song, he changes several notes and all over again. A...l get it. We serve him to fix the songs and later he makes a collection out of them. Let's check the song "ln the town of Budim". This really annoys me. Stay calm, Dragan. Thank you, thank you very much. - Thanks God, Miss. My name's Milorad Mitrovic. The boy for whom many girls of the female high school sigh? Who wrote that song About beautiful Lady Ann from Madrid Who has never exchanged a glance with a man All the girls would like to be that lady Ann. - What do you think... Who was in my thoughts while l was writing that song? - l don't know. lf you want me to confess you that l was thinking of you l won't do it unless you make me do it. l just want to thank you for helping me. l don't know what happened to him suddenly. As if he wasn't mine. He was listening to somebody else. He's a good horse. What are you doing? - Giving him a lump of sugar. l see now. You are his ward. - May l be yours too? l solemnly pronounce you. Besides lady Ann in Madrid there's knight Pedro, nice but a real don Juan Talk, Miss, you know when you are talking your words become kisses. You are kissing words. l would like to see you more often. - Why? You may start liking me. Your horse likes me. Say something. My father approved of making a mixed choir of the students in our school. l will join it if you join. - Go and sing in the choir, Sir. Goodbye. Wait, why are you leaving? - There comes my mother. What's that? lt's a winding frog. Listen to this. - A miracle of technology. What are we going to do with it? - Try to confuse professor Zecevic. And prevent him from examining us. - That's right. Where are you going to hide it? - l'll think out something. Where is this coming from? - What? Can you here these frogs? - What frogs, Sir? You don't hear frogs? - No. What frogs? What the devil is going on? Let's talk about your students a little. No generation has ever been out of control as this one. No generation has ever been unique as this one. They go their own way in reading, thinking and studying. - l agree. They read, they think, they study.. lt's a generation for the future. To study, to think, to work... They are such because you indulged them too much. Concerning my indulgence that can be discussed and yours that can't be discussed , more and more convinced l am that this generation has grown up for Europe. For Europe! Stuff and nonsense! They go too far... they have no measure. The world is their measure. Each of them is one measure. - l don't understand. lf you knew them the way l do, you would understand. - l know them. Look at that Jovan Cvijic. l'm sure that our country, Serbia will be known worldwide thanks to him. lt will if he doesn't fall into that hole. He will not. - l say he will. No, he will not. l'm sure he will. - No, he will not. Haven't l told you! - You were right. Get him out of there! You say that they know everything. - Well, he didn't know for that hole. There's no generation that knows everything They, at least, have learnt how to think. Look at Mihailo Petrovic. A great fisherman among graduating pupils. Yea, he's hell of a fisherman! Sure he is! Get in, why are you sneaking there? Come in boys. Faster! You're singing in the choir. - Yes. You haven't taken your places properly. Sopranos, altos, tenors...basses, baritones... take your places. Get a move! Here l am in the choir. Mitrovic, l didn't know that you are soprano. Go to baritones. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a big day for Serbian music. You are the first mixed choir in the Serbian history. Do you know what it means? For the first time in Serbia girls and boys are singing together. l want your best manners. You know what it means, especially the boys. We've already rehearsed the song Mirjana separately. Let's try to sing it together. Mitrovic, as first, you are not a soloist. As second, just open your mouth. Take this ball of thread. - What for? lt can be very dangerous that thing with the ball. But it's very pleasant, too. - My mom will punish me if she notices it. Don't worry, she won't. What's going on? She asked me to walk her home. - Nice. She lives close to here. Go step by step. The same way a country is conquered. What shall l say to her? - Talk to her about things you like. Make a date with her. - So soon? - Quickly, go! Miss Mila! - Yes, please. l hear that you play the violin nicely. l prefer go fishing. - Fishing. lt must be very exciting. Yes. That's why l spend much time by the river, day and night, in winter and summer. Most of all l like fishing a catfish. - A catfish! Yes, it's very voracious. - Oh, it's so romantic. - Yes, it is. lt's really romantic. - What about you? Are you romantic? - l am. Not as romantic as you are. But l could become. l'm sure you could. Sure? How? Tell me. Come fishing with me. You mean the two of us alone by the river. - lf you feel like it. Yes, l do. - You do? - Yes. Just keep it a secret. - Sure. Nobody will know. Good afternoon Sir. Don't touch the desks and don't move until your teacher arrives. Quickly, quickly. Mr Vujic, please. Follow me, please. What's going on here? Kosovo? May we sit so that you can see well? Sit down! What have l sinned God to send me you to be my last generation to teach! l won't regret to retire on pension. What can you see, Sir? What's to be seen? Disorder and disrespect. Please have a better look. Don't you see orthographic signs for French accents? You can see them on the board, too. As we were getting ready for our French lesson, in order to learn French accents we put our desks in this position. L'accent circonflexe, l'accent aigu l'accent grave... Cut it off, Popovic, you'll do everything to....- To remember better. Shut up, Popovic. - l just wanted to clear up the situation. The principal is right, l've indulged you too much. Too much! Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Sit down, children. Gentlemen, please. Bravo! Bravo! - Who came to this idea? Was it you, Popovic? lt was me. Let the principal hear you all together. Your class is extraordinary, Sir. lt's all right. l've got to go. Popovic, you will be punished any way when the lesson is over. lt's all right. l know him very well. He is always speaking like that. See you later. Children, your interest in French language and its accents is fascinating. l hope while l'm testing you, you will amaze me with your knowledge. Petrovic, irregular verbs. Where are we teacher? - This place is called Viline vode. Where are we going? - To the stonemason to order a tombstone. Excuse me, Sir, for whom? For myself. Don't be surprised. This is a neglected cemetery of court horses. Look at this: Here lies my dear horse Arslan, proud Arab which l got from Sultan and which used to carry me in hunting. Princ Mihailo Obrenovic. l didn't know that they had written epitaphs and built tombstones to horses. - Now you know. lf these horses can have tombstones, than l should have one too. Am l right? - l guess you are. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, professor. - You know me. Everybody knows you. My name's Krunoslav. l won't ask you what have brought you here 'cause nothing good can bring you to my place. - But, it can be good. How come? - l want to order a tombstone. That can be good, at least for me. What kind of tombstone? Like this one. Here's the draft. l'd better do it my way. lt would be easier for me. l don't want to make it easier for you. l will pay for that tombstone. Here are the dimensions and it is drawn where you should put the name, the date and later we will see. - As you wish. - Like this one, made of white marble. White? - Yes. - Black granite is better. - l don't care what is better. l want a tombstone of white marble. - But it's not mourning colour. Black colour fits the dead. Neither was l grieving for myself in life nor will l be grieving in death. l want to rejoice at death since l can't escape from it. lt will take time since l have to buy the marble. - l'm not in a hurry. Aren't you surprised that l want to build a tombstone for myself? We all grieve for someone. l'm not going to die for long... So you're going to grieve for yourself for a long time. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Gentlemen, l 've arranged this so we can have a rehearsal. What are we going to sing? - "To my pipe". Nonsense. ln this situation? My silver made pipe l would smoke, but l'm broke.... O Serbia dear mother l will always call you such Dear country, dear home in your heart it is always warm. "To my pipe"...nonsense. Get set go! Everyone will tell you that since the opening of this school Kosta Vujic has truly been the best teacher of them all. His appearance among other things... Sit down! Who will get the hat? You can't all go. We have just one hat. We'll do it by no fear or favour. Alphabetically. Letter...B Branislav Rajic and V.. Vasilije Simic Thank you Sir. Branislav! - Yes Sir? l've never asked you why you always come to school barefoot? For many reasons, Sir. One of them is that l have no shoes. This young man speaks rationally. Go and don't step on some glass. Don't worry, Sir, the soles of my feet are thicker than the soles of your shoes. Prodanovic, tell us who opened the window. - l don't know, Sir. l didn't. Prodanovic, you will be the monitor for another three months. He can't be. What do you mean he can't? Who is the head teacher, you or me? lmbecile! An imbecile is considered a person who speaks irrationally and what l said was quite true. Since we have only one month before the final examination, Jakov can't be the monitor for another three months. All right. You are not an imbecile. Sorry for that. Jovan Cvijic, would you be so kind to go to the corner. Jakov Prodanovic, would you be so kind to go to the corner. Jakov shouldn't stand in the corner. l've opened the window. What? You've opened the window? l thought you were already skilled that you couldn't miss. l even took a bet. Who did you take the bet with? - With Ljubomir Stojanovic. Ljubomir.. You took a bet against your favourite poet's blood brother. l won the bet but l truly believe that you can hit the shelf with the hat with the window open, but you just are not in good mood today. Sure l can do that. You're completely right. Go to the corner! Since you are here, let me examine you a little. Jakov, let us hear about Schiller. What have you learnt? What would you like to hear - what relates to my nature or what doesn't. Give an example. "Nothing but acting towards a definite aim makes life bearable." You see, it relates to my nature and me. Tell me how Schiller defines a free man? Only the morally educated man is completely free. Remember this Schiller's thought as a rule of life. Popovic! Do you agree with Schiller? l might agree with his quote which says "lf every man cared for people every individual would have a world." Why might, Popovic? ln youth, love has no limits. Yes, but analyzing that thought thoroughly, l find that l couldn't be that kind of philanthropist. l think that nobody, not even our poet Milorad Mitrovic could be that. Don't say that, he's been very loving these days. Both to people and horses. - l agree with you, but Schiller himself didn't use conditionals without purpose. And conditionals are not real. Not ever. Why do you think our poet Milorad wouldn't find himself in that quote? lf l searched for Schiller's thought that relates to him, l would choose this one: That means: "The stars of your fate lie in your bosom." l think that Popovic saved me from Schiller. - Nobody can save you. Come in. Where have you been for so long? -Why didn't you ask for help? We were trying to get the hat off the tree. - With stones. Thank you for your help. Put the hat on its place. You can go to your places. Rajic Branislav, l will not examine you today. Go to the widow of deceased Minister of justice Milan Markovic, tell her that l'm sending you to do some chores. She can give you some clothes in return. - l'll do that. Thank you. My smart alecs! l know someone who would never go to the town of Zemun. Am l right Velimir? Yes Sir? - You would never go to that rotten town, would you? l wouldn't Sir. You are always present at school. - Yes, Sir. All your marks are excellent. - All of them,Sir. You never go to town or inns. - The only way l know is school-home. lt's unbearable, Velimir. - Why Sir? That annoys your friends, and me too. What annoys you, Sir? That stupid determination of yours not to make a single mistake in your life. Are you angry with me. Sir? - You learn from your mistakes, son. l don't get it. l gave right to all of you to make a mistake. Only you didn't make any. - ls that my fault, Sir? No it's my fault. Forgive me for not telling you in time how to change that. My clever boy. The hat on sight! l see that you are surprised, Sir. Of course l'm surprised. You were present when the principle allowed us to... - Do not play fool. He allowed you to bring some snacks to school. But not to make a market out of them. Should l remind you Sir what exactly the principle said? What exactly? He literally said that we could bring what we had at home. Smart alecs! Shame on you! Spendthrifts! Now clear it all up. Quickly! Shame on you! Order, please! Pick up your things. Pass me the grade book. Nobody should know for this. ls that clear? - Yes. Okay. Order! Where were we last time? You are finally dressed up, a? - l certainly am, Sir. l have recognized the counselor's tailcoat. He was a little shorter. Silence, please. Let me see your new shoes. They are cool! Take the coat off. You're not allowed to wear it at school anyway. lt only matters that you are finally dressed. The counselor's wife sends you her regards and asks you to forgive me for being late for school. Sit down. Take off your hat. You don't like my playing, Miss Mila. l'm doing it for you. l like it, but... You'd better play for the fish. To play for the fish? Yes. You see that your fishing rods are standing still. l see it. The same way you are. - l beg your pardon? What do you want to say? Who told you that? - You. You want to say that l haven't taken the bait. -Yes. Then go to play for your fish. They may respond to your courting. l'm ready to any foolishness to please you, Miss Mila. Even to play for the fish. lncredible. Have they responded to your courting? - And you? What about you Miss Mila? - Look! - What? What has come over you Mr Petrovic? - Miss Mila! They are cooking beans.... but they must have put some rotten ribs. Where were we in our last lesson? Now l remember, l was examining Cvijic... May l be excused today, Sir? - Are you okay, Cvijic. l don't think anybody of us should answer about Schiller any more. After Jasa Prodanovic and Paja Popovic, no matter how much we know we will get marks under the influence of their knowledge. lf l tried to find myself in Schiller l would not agree with him. "Where nature rules mankind must disappear". "Nature is the greatest in the smallest things."Ancient Latins used to say. l could also deny Schiller with Milton's quote which says: We can dispute Schiller with La Martine's quote You mean that one: "ln his most wonderful dreams the man could not invent anything as beautiful as nature." All right, Cvijic. l'll have to give you the mark you already have. lt's your right, Sir. And you have an A! A! l beg your pardon? Smart alecs! l'm not a smart alec, Sir. l'm just sitting next to one. - Sit down. l'll agree with Cvijic and we will not discuss Schiller any more. Who hasn't been examined in German? Can you tell us... in your own words how much time would it take you... to get to town and bring me some tripes? Not much if l go by bicycle. - Then go by bicycle. l'll be waiting in Dardaneli inn. - All right, Sir. Well, let's go back to examining. Ljubomir Stojanovic. There are also crabs today, Sir. Crabs? Where? - At the market. l've seen them. Petrovic! You will be a man one day. - Thank you. l'll be a man too. - Why? - l saw the crabs, too. - Then you will be a man. l saw the crabs, too. - Then, you will be a man. - What about me? - You too. You will all be men one day. - Who'll go to the market to buy me some crabs? Read the time Popovic. - Four minutes and twenty-three seconds. - Not bad. Be careful. - lt's ok. Here are your tripes, Sir. Very fresh. You will be a man, son. - Thank you. - You're welcome. C'mon, Ljuba. l'm afraid that Jovan Cvijic is going to be the first victim of the bicycle in Belgrade. Be careful Cvijic, watch your step. Riding a bicycle can be dangerous. l agree with you, Sir. lt isn't dangerous, Sir. We have learnt how to ride it. You don't remember what you have learnt from Goethe. Danger can't be learnt. What does it have to do with the bicycle? Look Sir, his Majesty King Milan is riding a bicycle. What do you think now, Sir? Nothing. Your legs are riding your ass. Listen to this: needlewomen are needed for sewing white linen. Listen to this: needlewomen are needed for sewing white linen. Priority to those who are good at shirt sewing. Do you have some more? Sorry, Sir, l was carried away reading some speeches on nature. That book is in English. As l know you speak German and French. You're just looking at pictures, a? - No, l have learnt some English in the last two years and professor Andra Nikolic helped me a little. Very good, Cvijic. Sit down. - Where shall l sit? - Ok, don't sit. You are a very clever boy. You are not like those idlers. They are always laughing. Listen to this. A printing-shop needs two girls for rolling. l could hear you from far away. Listen to this, teacher. - What? A piano is missing. A finder who brings it to the butcher's at Cubura and gives it to Milos Djordjevic will be awarded. Take this. Thank you. Can l take away your cane? - No, let me have it at hand so that l can...- Okay. Good afternoon Sir. My friend, this country is ruined because of officers. What people make, officers ruin. Am l right, Milorad? They're doing everything here to repress the intelect rather than to combat poverty. Many people in Serbia say they had nothing for lunch. And for dinner they had leftovers from lunch. Life is not an idealistic novel. Do you agree with me? - About what? - That life is not an idealistic novel. You are right. - Life can be a song, too. "At that moment in the castle a window suddenly opened and a girl as pretty as angel started to speak shyly and tremble. Do you still love me? - he asked Look how pale love has made me. The girl with shame overwhelmed threw a flower to him. And he could feel peace again and the night could return. A nightingale sang about them its song was full of tenderness." Good afternoon, professor. - Good afternoon. Has the war begun? Not yet. - Why are you wearing a panoply? The war hasn't started yet, but it doesn't mean that it won't. That's why l'm here. To show our students some military maneuvers. Here, on the Sava? Of course. Today or tomorrow, they will be defending our country maybe right here, on the Sava. The river Sava is not just for sunbathing. lt's a border of our country. All of you, come here and watch the maneuver carefully. Come here. The teacher is calling us. Listen to me carefully. As soldiers in a war you can be ordered to swim across the river wearing an armour to reconnoiter enemy positions. Look at me carefully. Get down! Get down! Don't help! Don't help! Take shelter! Run away! Quickly! Bloody Austrians! We will drive you away to the hell from this bank. Excuse me, professor. - lt's all right. May God save us. How do you like the sweetbreads? - They are great. l hear that you are going to be retired on pension soon. - Yes. Cheers! - Cheers! Best wishes for your retirement. - Thank you. Concerning it, you'd ordered roasted lamb in clay oven. - Yes. What kind of clay are you going to use? - What do you mean? You can't roast lamb in any clay. You'll not eat clay but lamb roasted in it. l want lamb roasted in the clay from Apatin. - All right. l'll see about it. Attention please! Attention! Look at here. What's that? - Our history teacher's notes. - What do you need them for? He insists on our knowing all historical dates, doesn't he? - Yes. He bothers us with it. - ls that right? - Right! Well there, let's make him teach us without his notes. - Right! Get ready for the lesson. The history teacher is coming. Sit down. ln our last lesson of the national history we were talking about the Serbian King Stefan Radoslav.... Well, the King Stefan Vladislav.. - Radoslav. - Radoslav. Excuse me, Sir you ,said Radoslav.. - Yes, Radoslav he was the first... Yes. Radoslav. He was a bad king anyway. He ruled short from 12... to...1231... He was more interested in liturgy problems. He didn't turn to the patriarch of Carigrad but to a...archbishop... The patriarch was in Nikea? - ln damn Nikea. l'm not going to bother you with Radoslav. After his first wife's death whose name was.... he married an illegitimate daughter of Assin which cost him his life. Saint Sava was not pleased, so at convocation at the monastery of Zica gave his throne to his pupil Arsenije. - What year did it happen, Sir? - Yes? What year? The date? - The year? When he gave his throne to his pupil. Yes, but when? - The date! He went to Palestine and Egypt later. What date? When? - When! - When? The most important for us to know is how and when Radoslav was dethroned. When was it? - lt is important. lt is well known... the date.. lt is so interesting how well known it is, the date, the year when he was dethroned. - What date? What date.... lt was on Thursday. Thursday...4th on Thursday...January...January 1...year.. lt is so important for us to know the date. He was dethroned, expelled... he ran to Dubrovnik with his wife... while his young brother Vladislav had better luck. The previous one didn't build any monasteries, but Vladislav built the monastery of Milesevo and he ruled from 124...no it was 122... My notes. They have disappeared. My precious, irreplaceable notes. You think that graduating pupils took them. Nobody but them could have taken my notes. lf you don't do something l'll go to the principal. Why would they take your precious notes? Why? l don't want any trouble, l just want my notes back. Let's not interrogate the whole class again. l'm not a tattletale, but if we don't solve the case l'll have to tell the principal. l am at a loss for words! Sit down. We can solve the problem just say... Petrovic, go to the corner and don't say a word! But Sir...- Shut up and go to the corner. - As you say. - l said stop talking. l only wanted to say that l understand you. - You keep talking. - l'll shut up. l will not say a word to you lest it would turn out that you cannot perform my command. To speak after your command? No way, Sir. You have the last word. l'm silent after you. No way, Sir. l'm not that ill- bred. - l'm silent after you. l'm silent after you Sir. - To the corner! What happened to professor Zecevic? Who has taken his notes? - No one. What do you need his notes for? - We need them... - Here you go again. l just wanted to explain why we needed his notes, but if you say, l will not talk any more. You'd better prove your assumptions and hypothesis when you are at college. l've already proved them. Nonsense! l confirm that he has proved them. Go to the corner, Popovic. He has proved them, professor Vujic. To the corner, Prodanovic. But he has really proved them. To the corner, Mitrovic. You're boring. Where are you going Cvijic? To the corner, Sir. Mihailo Petrovic has proved that our history teacher does not know a single historical date and he asks from us to know all of them. During our history lesson none of the dates he said fits to those in his notes. Without his notes he wouldn't know he wouldn't even know when Bastille was destroyed. How shall we return your history teacher his notes? How shall you and l apologize to him? l think that tomorrow our history teacher will apologize to you 'cause l'm sending him his notes from Zemun today. - From Zemun? As you know Zemun is abroad and knowing professor Zecevic he will think that his notes are a subject of interest to military intelligence of powerful Austria-Hungary. - What a sharp tongue you have! We are talking about professor Zecevic's reputation. This can help him candidate for Society of learned academics. Listen Petrovic, l hope that one they you will be an academic so you will have to weigh your words before saying them. l will be an academic. - So, will l. - So will l.... lt is possible. Very much possible. Smart alecs! Dear God thank you for giving them talent and wisdom. Milorad... You are in love, Mirjana. What's going on here? lt's nine and you are still awake. Go to sleep immediately! Take the end of this thread ball and put it by the window. - Why? - l'll tell you later. C'mon, please. - Nonsense. Now pull it and let it fall down slowly in the garden. lt's enough. Get back to bed. Let's sleep. - Nonsense. l've done the tombstone according to your draft. Here it is. Kosta Vujic, teacher of the First male high school, born in 1824, died in 18... we'll see about it later.... He left with those who arrived. He was cheerful and people found him cheerful. Goethe. What have you done, for God's sake? - l've made a tombstone as you said. That's not true. - Everybody who saw it was amazed. At cemetery nobody will pass by without looking at it. You have set the year of my death! No, it was you who set it. You have set the century in which l would die. Are you playing God? For God's sake, no. Why have you put the figure 8 here? lt was not on my draft. l thought you had omitted it, professor. - Very generous, thanks for nothing. Your job is to carve not to think. How do you know that l will not live to see the 20th century? You wouldn't have come to order the tombstone if you hadn't thought of dying soon. - You go again thinking. l gave you another fifteen years of living, professor. - Who do you think you are to give me another fifteen years of living? lf you live longer..- Yes l will correct the figure on the tombstone at my own expense. You will not correct anything. l want another tombstone. What? No, there will not be another tombstone professor. l'm asking you for the last time. Are you going to make another tombstone? For the last time, l am not. - l'll sue you! The court will agree with me. - We'll see about that! - l can't wait! We will see! - Sure we will. You just open your mouth. What the devil is this? - Someone is singing a serenade. lt's beautiful. A serenade? l'll give it to them! They'll get it! Mother had a daughter as beautiful as a picture as tender as a rose And she fell in love with a boy.... once upon a time there was a rose... Rowdies! You'll see what is what! l'll show you what's what! - Don't make a scene. You don't say! This is your awesome youth! Long live love! - You see what their music teacher has thought them! You are completely right Madam. Like teachers like students. What country we live in! Not even ministers can have peace. Love gives no peace, not even to ministers. That's why l'm shouting Long live love! - Long live love! Mitrovic, don't stand up... tell me the whole story. Step by step. Well there... l remember it was a mild late evening and the sky, the sky was like blue velvet and the moon, the moon was full and warm the nighter greeted him as if they were friends.... l've already read about this summer night's description. l want the facts. lt was like when Branko Radicevic and you sang to girls. How do you know what Branko Radicevic and l were doing in Vienna? You told us. - l was wrong to tell you. l was wrong. l was wrong. You sneak up to a window and sing Branko's song: "A boy with black eyes came on a horse quickly..." The window opens, a girl throws a rose and her mother throws a flowerpot at you! lt really was like that. Wait... You want to say l taught you to be so impudent. But you sang Sir, didn't you? We did. Sure we did. But we didn't sing to minister's daughter. Rowdies! Come here. What did you sing? - We sang that song of his. He is now our poet, like Branko. You want to hear it? - Yes. And he? - l sing, he..... - l write. Nice...nice Nice. But you were shouting in front of the minister's house. We only shouted: "long live love" - Long live! - Okay. The problem is that your principle asks me to punish you severely. What shall l do? Punish us. - Yes, Petrovic? Punish us, we won't be angry with you. The principle will. Sit down, Petrovic. To punish you? Forget it. l'm having my last lesson anyway. You should know Sir, that at this moment it's not easy for us either. Thank you, Velja. Sit down. Have you all been examined? - All but you, Sir. Let me hear your questions. What is it that you're never going to tell us. l will not tell you. You have a great historical opportunity in front of you and you have to take it. But first, you have to create that opportunity. Jovan Cvijic? - Yes, Sir? l see you moving the boundaries of science and defining the boundaries of your country. Sit down. Mihailo Petrovic. - Should l go to the corner? l see you catching great glory as a scientist. Sit down. Pavle Popovic. l see you coming to this school every day, going to the same inns l used to go, ordering meals l used to order. Prodanovic. - l see you.... - How? As a prime minister... of the government against which you yourself stage demonstrations. Sit down. Mitrovic. l see you as a poet with hard destiny but eternal glory. Sit down. Ljuba Stojanovic. l see you going up the stairs of the royal academy with measured steps either to a pedestal or to a scaffold. Gentlemen, concerning my lessons, that'll be all. Teacher...the last bell hasn't rung yet. l want to see you at my place at half past three. - We will be there. Be careful with that! You know where to place everything? Yes, professor, you are not moving for the first time. Where did you take that book from? - From the basket with Goethe's works. What does Goethe say? Collection of anecdotes and proverbs. Listen to me! This is my spiritual will to you. Your education is a collection of anecdotes. You have left a great collection of anecdotes. What will happen to those anecdotes when we go further? lf you want the anecdotes about you to become significant and remembered, you have to become remarkable men. Brilliant anecdotes about insignificant men become insignificant themselves. Petrovic? - Yes, Sir? Why have you put the cage with my budgies on your head? So that they can hear you better, Sir. Thus they will remember all you say and will keep repeating it to us. Smart alecs! Kosta Vujic, teacher at first male high school......1824-1... He left with those who arrived he was cheerful and he found this world cheerful. Goethe. Move! Cheerful, warm and rejoicing Around Belgrade goes a story lt's about Professor Vujic And his eternal glory. lt's about Professor Vujic And his eternal glory. He feels good about moving Greeting people in the street Since the landlord didn't please him Another one he'd like to meet Since the landlord didn't please him... Pull over.. - What's now? - Why have you pulled over? Mr Vujic, would you please get off the carriage? l would, but l have to hold my tombstone. Would you like to go with us? You want others to see me with you? - You are angry again. l was going to tell you something very nice. For how long are you going to make a show of with your moving? Mr Kozarac, l will not punish them! What do you mean? - l just refuse to punish them. l was teaching them German but it's not so important. l'm afraid that in future you and l will be known only for having been their teachers. Thank you Mr Kozarac. Thank you. Move on. He feels good about moving Greeting people in the street Since the landlord didn't please him Another one he'd like to meet Since the landlord didn't please him Another one he'd like to meet. While he's sitting in the carriage Of his moving people speak Never misses the tradition This professor so unique. Never misses the tradition This professor so unique. You know where to place the brick. - Under the bed. - Good. Why do you keep it under the bed? To get used to its warmth and smell. Aren't you going to make a toilet? ln the shape of a heart. Smart alecs! What you are doing? Thank you very much. - You're welcome, teacher. You've done this very well. Our final exams start tomorrow. l hope you will pass them. After that, everybody goes their own way. Goodbye teacher. - Goodbye. Here's your lamb in clay oven as you wished. Enjoy it, Sir. Smart alecs. l'd better do it my way. lt would be easier for me.
