You the death doula? Excuse me? You're late. You're the next of kin? Yeah, I guess. Well, my name is Malison McCourt. I'm a palliative technician with Lifesource Closures, and we'd like to extend our compassion to you at this sensitive time. I'd like to personally reassure you that your family's closure will be meaningful, merciful and memorable. Just cut the crap. I heard this all at the processing, okay? Just put the needle in and you're done. If I could do it myself I would have already, okay? - What? - It's my first day. Oh, well, good for you. She's in this room, you sit here. How long has she been like this? She hasn't been out of bed in four years. Coma. Stubborn as a mule. Is there anything that you'd like to say? No. She will go painlessly. Okay. No. - Murderer. - Oh, my God. No. No, no, no, no. No. No, no, no. No! I should have done this a long time ago. That's illegal! You can't just do that! There's a word for what you just did! 8:17 a.m. Ms. McCourt! You can't have cats in your flat. I don't have cats, I have a cat. I know your type. I don't want any goddamn cat ladies in my building. When is the furnace being fixed in here, Mr. Poole? Oh, you're demanding now. I'm not demanding, I'm simply asking. There're a couple of old buggers over there that could use our services. That's not funny, Mr. Winston. No, you're right. I'm sorry. So, uh, you had a bad day? You had a bad start, am I right? I just need to know that the clients are being screened properly. That is a priority, but to be quite honest by the time you techies get there, everything is legally sound. See we're heavily regulated. Heavily. So everyone at Lifesource Closures has dotted the I's and crossed the T's so you can do whatever it takes to just close. You know? Turn the lights out. That's your job. Okay? The client called me a murderer. They can do that. I mean, you think you're the first one? I mean these people, half of them, they're like total baskets. Whatever comes out of them is gonna be crap. But the client is the family. Okay? - I need this job. - Sure you do. And it's a great job. I mean, okay, this crap that happened to you yesterday? Well, it happens. It happens to everyone, okay? But I've worked a little something out for you, okay? It's just that none of this was covered in the training. We do this sometimes, all right? We have this program where we send you out with an experienced techie, who will help you through the things that aren't covered in the training course. Like the client calling me a murderer? Not the client! Not the client. The client is the family, and you served them perfectly and legitimately. - Okay? - Okay. So, now, we'll send you out tomorrow to close with Olivia Bletcher. Now she's got three years, she's been with us from the beginning. She is a total pro, and everything that this job can throw at you has been thrown at her. Now Olivia is going to help you with your confidence, she's going to help you make the right call if things go south. She's going to be your friend. Okay. Thank you Mr. Winston. Yes, this client is very important, okay? He's very rich. He's, you know, a little eccentric, too. Now, it's an out of town job so take your car and pack for three days. Hey, kiddo, come on, lighten up. This is euthanasia, it's not like we're saving lives or anything here. Just remember what I tell all my girls. This is a goddamn suicide mission so take no prisoners! Run, Charley. Mr. Poole? Now anointed my head with oil my cup runeth over. Surely goodness and mercy should fall on me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Are you okay? I'm praying for you. Jesus, to forgive you. What? Thou shalt not kill! That's offensive! Stop it! Stop it! Lucy? Mr. Poole? Mr. Poole? Mr. Poole? Are you in here? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about earlier, about what I said. What are you doing in there? I had a dream. You're going to kill me. You'll kill anyone, isn't that right? It's your job, I understand. In my dream, God told me to tell you something. The people you kill don't go to him. They go to you. Mr. Poole, you've just had a terrible dream. Please go back to bed. You can't live here anymore. - Hey, hun. - Hi. Trunk? How long you plan on staying? I'm just in between moves. Winston said you had a rough one yesterday. It was awful. I'm so glad that you're here now. Well, they say that they screen the clients, but I'm pretty sure they only vet bank balances. That's terrible. In the training they made it all sound so noble. And they used words like, "dignity" and "closure" and I guess I just bought the whole thing. - Smoke? - No, thanks. - Mind if I smoke? - Um, sure. If you could just put the window down. Sure. Well I'm looking forward to this one. Three, days in the country. Nicely stocked wine cellar, no doubt. I don't drink. The old guy's loaded. We might even get tipped. So morbid, Olivia. Good one, Mal. Can I call you Mal? Yeah. That's... That's actually what my mom used to call me. What do you like to be called? Olivia is good enough. Okay, Olivia. Have you had night terrors yet? - Have I what? - Night terrors. They're part of the job. They don't cover that. You get a couple of bad nights. Night terrors. Sounds awful, what causes that? I think it's just your unconscious dealing with the fact that, well, adjusting to the fact that you're now killing people. Closing, closure. - You're closing. - Closing people. - Closing people. - Right. You'll be good. You're a company girl now. Shall we knock first? Yeah. Are you ready for this? No, I'm really not. Malison! Come on. - Murderer. - Did you hear that? Don't do that Malison, I'll jump out of my fucking skin. Murderer. Murderer! Oh, my God! It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. You're okay, you're okay. Is she all right? Oh, God. What? Malison, meet Edgar. I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. I don't know what happened. You fainted. You hit your head. I will fix it. That is the most socially fucked up person I have ever met. Poor man, I probably scared him. You don't know the half of it. I think you made him cry. - What? - Right after you went down he just took off inside. Oh, my God, I'm mortified. No, you have nothing to worry about. - How's your head? - It's okay. I need to go apologize to him. No, Malison, wait for him to come back. - What's his name again? - Edgar. Edgar. I'm so sorry, I feel ridiculous. Possum. Excuse me? Possum under here. Oh. Of course, I thought I heard something so that must have been it. Possum. Possum's pregnant. They bite. Right. What? - He strangled a possum. - He what? With his bare hands. He's bonkers, Olivia. He's crazy. Best to stay inside when it's dark. What'd you do with it? - The possum? - Yeah. Got rid of it. Well, that's good. Thank you, Edgar. You're on the second floor. This way then? Malison, come on. - Where'd he go? - Up here, I think. He's a focused man. He strangled a pregnant possum. Where's Mr. Somborac? First floor. Can't make the stairs. Do you stay with him? Carriage house. So he sleeps in the house by himself? He needs 24 hour care by the sounds of it. He's still alive. Can't die. Not properly. So you're his executor then? Are you his son? The other bedroom is down the hall. You know, this looks big enough for two. I think we'll stick together. Right, hun? Do you have any refreshments? Bottle of wine perhaps? I ring the bell at first light. That's breakfast. Hear that, Esmeralda? He wants to talk to you. That's fine, there's formalities. Fine print things to go over. He has specific things he wants. Don't we all? It will be better in the morning. What will be better in the morning? No wine cellar, yet. I feel sorry for him. Oh, it's freezing in here. He's not used to being around people. Someone you can relate to. Maybe. I'm sorry, that was mean. I can't help myself sometimes. You're right. Come on. Let's be friends. What? Sorry, I just wasn't expecting it. Well, don't make me feel weird. Don't worry about the night terrors. They're not that bad. I just had the worst thought. What? How much you want to bet that little creep has a peephole? I don't think he's smart enough. Help me look. I'd have one if I was him. Are you kidding? He's probably choking his little possum right now. He's in there! - Are you kidding? - I'm not kidding. He's right in there, I just saw him. That little fucker! Wait here. Go away! Go away, stop it! - Stop it! - Stop what? Please, don't leave me in here again. It's okay. He's gone, he left the house. He went back to his servant shack. Let's try and stay calm, okay? I'm going to go out for a cigarette. Please don't leave me in here. Come with me. Edgar went that way. Look at this place. It's huge. Seems like a lot for two men. One of whom's bed ridden. Something's not right about it. Why call us all the way out here? Why not just have Edgar do it? Lover boy sleeps over there I guess. God, I'm so scared. Of what? Damn possums, what do you think? All right. It's so dark I can feel them out here. Stop it. Giant mole men. I said stop it. Sorry. I miss Lucy. Someone's watching it, right? Boyfriend or? No, I lived alone. Good for you. Not really. It's terrible. I don't even think I can go back to... What? That place looks mad. Look at it. Looks alive. Do you think it likes us, Liv? Hi, my name is Malison McCourt. I'm a palliative technician with Lifesource Closures. We would like to extend our compassion to you and your family at this sensitive time. I'd like to personally reassure you that your family's closure will be memorable, merciful and meaningful. So, I guess we meet the guy today. - Our victim? - Don't. Did you read the brief? He's palliative. Bad shape. It should be easy. What do you make of this special dispensation clause? Don't worry, I'm sure this guy wants to go out, sitting under his favorite tree or something. I have to show you what you can't do. Come with me. Good morning to you too, Edgar. Edgar, when do we meet Somborac? - Malison! - Sorry. Where did he go? You know our Edgar, he's focused. Sorry. Some of these statues are really odd. Edgar! - What? - Sorry, just my nerves, I guess. Edgar! Edgar! Where are you? This is ridiculous. What do you think he meant by stuff we can't do? I don't know. I'll go this way, you go around. No, no, I'll go through here, you go around. Okay, suit yourself. Shout if you find him. Olivia! Olivia! Edgar! Anybody! Olivia! It's okay, it's me, it's Olivia. You're okay. You're okay, I'm here. Guess what we're not supposed to do? Go in the maze. It's very important that no one goes in the maze. I can't explain it Mal, I think you might still be in shock from the first close you did. I'd understand if you left. I'm not going to leave you Olivia. Do you think I've been hysterical? No. And that is an old word with an ugly meaning and you shouldn't use it. Tell me you hear that. Yes, he plays every day at 11:00. He was about to go do that while we were looking for you. He has five pianos. And five thumbs by the sounds of it. Liv. - It's Olivia, remember? - Right, sorry. Do you ever think that sometimes what we're doing is kind of wrong? It's our job, hun. That's all it is. We're actually killing people, Liv. Olivia, I'm sorry. I know we're supposed to feel this connection with ancient whatever... Oh, God, did Winston give you his Eskimo granny speech? No. "It's like I tell all my girls," stick granny on an ice block and shove her out to sea. "If they did it, it can't be wrong." I know. And I like because it's all about choice it's just... Look, if you want activism go pitch a tent at city hall, okay? It's our job. You can call me Liv, it's fine. So let's go see what this old fuck's special dispensation is anyway. We're ready. Malison just had a little panic attack but we're fine. Follow you then? - I will speak for him. - That's fine. Everything's been signed. He's basically going to be a witness from hereon in. Give me a moment. Please. These are the clerks, Miss McCourt and Miss Bletcher. Glad to meet you, Mr. Somborac. We will do all that we can to ensure your closure carries out with as much meaning as you wish. Everything has been signed. Edgar has done an excellent job of putting things in order for you. We understand that you would like us to consider a special dispensation. Me? What does he mean? Is he referring to... I, Milos Somborac, appoint Edgar Birde to read out and assist with my request for special dispensation on the manner of my passing. I have been assured that upon submitting extra consideration to Lifesource Closures that this request will be followed to the letter. First I am to be conveyed, at dusk, to the Dahkma located centrally in the Durhta closest to the garden. Sorry, a Dahkma, what is a Dahkma exactly? A reading from select passages in the Bardo Thodol will then take place followed by a minute of silent prayer. Are we going to get a copy of this beforehand? It's always good to go over... The appointed rogyapas must be female to receive the tingu, and she must be absolved in juniper before receiving blessed guidance. So, it's a Buddhist ceremony then? Lovely. Uh... what is a tingu? The tingu is a sacred Himalayan Kukri Knife. The rogyapas are then rendered by Eurasian griffons to the maze, and the soul is conveyed clear of profanity by the mouths of the blessed protector, Fulvis. I have a couple of questions. Okay, I didn't understand most of that so are we going to get a translation or something beforehand? The blessed guidance will not be received before the prayer. Right, so we'll be relying on you for that as well then? Well, you are the chosen rogyapas. You will understand more than me. What happened to him? His face? I mean, was there a fire or something? No, there was no fire. He has always looked like that to me. It is 2:00. I have to play. - Play? - He means play. Some of the words he used, they sounded kind of familiar. I heard it before. Here. Bardo Thodol. Yeah, he said something, Bardo Thodol. Tibetan book of the dead. Oh, God, Olivia. Let's go find a nice place for an afternoon read, shall we? I feel better. Oh, good, I'm glad. Stress can really play with you. I don't know why but when I saw his face I just, I felt okay. Really? Not me. I couldn't even look at him. Oh, shit, Mal, here it is. - A Jhotar is a sky burial. - Sky burial, what's that? It's a ritual performed for the purpose of releasing a soul from the clutches of vengeful spirits that wish to lay claim to it through their desire for eternal revenge. Okay, it says, "the Jhotar cannot be used" to absolve petty wrongs such as passionate murder, but it is reserved for crimes with a measurable gravity. Specifically, the entrapment of no fewer than 12 souls "through the instruments of suicide." I don't get it, do you? Okay, whatever. What, specifically, is a sky burial? It's a de-fleshing sacrament. "The flesh of the subject is removed by the royagpas" using a Kukri Knife made from the bones of a suicide. The organs are then fed up to birds of prey, which conveys the spirit in its mouth to the sky, to eternal deliverance from the ravages "of purgatorial vengeance." What? What, what is it? What? Olivia! No! No! No! No! Olivia, breathe! Olivia! Olivia, breathe! Olivia! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - What now? - Nothing. We have to talk. Are you okay? I'm fine, I think it was just an asthma attack or something. I didn't know you had asthma, you didn't tell me that. I haven't had it since I was a kid. Look, he wants us to cut him up. You know that, right? I think, figuratively, I don't think... No, he actually wants us to carve him up and feed him to birds. That's insane. Fuck, I should have known better. I should've asked Winston some questions. Mr. Winston? That guy paid a million dollars for this. What do you want to do? Well, I'm going to draw a line here. I mean, we can't do that. Right? I mean, we just can't. - Agree with me, please! - Of course. Okay. So tomorrow we call Winston, - we tell them we're sorry, and we just go. - What about Mr. Somborac? You saw him, he probably won't even make it till then. He just needs to die, on his own. We came all this way. Look, if you want to do this you go ahead but I'm out. Me too. Good. Let's get some sleep. Malison. No. No wood. Edgar, you startled me. There is no more wood. I'd bring it in but, after tomorrow... After tomorrow, no need. Are you sad? I understand. You're going to be here all alone. Are you going to stay here? After, I mean. This is how you stay warm. I will stay after, but... Can I tell you something Edgar? After tomorrow, I have nowhere. I got thrown out of my room for having a cat. Now, I don't even have the cat. So for now, this is where I live. I guess it's always been that way. There's two houses here. One that your friend sees, and one that you see. Juniper. Keep the house that you see away. Does it want to hurt me? They want you to hurt yourself. Hot water. Warm you. Get clean for tomorrow. Turn the lights out. That's your job. You are the chosen royagpas. You will understand more than me. Put a needle in it and you're done. He just needs to die, on his own. Do it. I'm sorry. I thought I heard you in pain. Don't talk to the children. Kill them first. They have to be the first to go. Malison? Malison! Malison! Malison? Edgar? Oh, for Christ sakes. Who are you? What are you doing down here? What are you doing down here? I asked you first. Fair enough. I came down here to get a fancy bottle of wine. A nice Chateau d'Laffite Rothschild. Now you. I was looking for my friend, and then we're gonna go. Are you a neighbor? Do they know you're here? Oh, sure, I've known Somborac forever. You do know what happened here don't ya? No. What? It's best to not talk about it out of respect for the boy. What boy? Edgar. You know Edgar. Poor lad. He seems slow but he ain't. It's just sadness. Comes out of the soil under our feet. And it fills you eventually. Slows you right down. You know... Slows ya till you stop. We should go find your friend. Wait, someone slammed the door. Was probably your friend looking for ya. Nope, nobody here. Somebody was. You should get your friend and leave. - That's what I said. - It's a good plan. Things might get bad if you stay. What's that supposed to mean? Malison! Olivia! Malison. You're here! Liv! It's just like you said, Liv! Liv, we're fucking cutting him up just like a fucking pig. See, I'm going to cut right down there and pull all his organs out and huck them up in the air. It's fucking crazy. What are you talking about? Our job, our job and it's totally the right thing to do. It's exactly what we need to do. There's... what I want to say, like, entities. They're like ghosts. Dead people and I can fucking hear them. I can see them and it's fucking amazing. Death cult. Curse warfare. Somborac studied it for years. He fucking led them here to die. Look... they want Somborac, they want him to die, because as soon as he does, he's all theirs. And they're pissed. They're really tricky, Liv. They want me to kill myself. They sent this little fucking girl to... to what? Just because they did it? Off themselves, she's my friend, she gets to know! Liv, it's true, all of it. It's true. Of what? Of what you ask? Telling people they will go somewhere by dying, and then not even going with them. They all got trapped here. Like worms in a pail. Don't believe me? I don't give a shit. This is our job. It's time to step the fuck up, Liv. Okay? Special dispensation. We're going to perform the Jhotar or whatever the fuck it is, and then bam, the client is free and he can go, and all these assholes, all these assholes that you see around here. They're listening to us, but that doesn't matter because it's too late for them. They know exactly what we're going to do, and they don't like it. You look upset. Don't be. It's gonna take like an hour and then we can just go. Stop it! Stop! It's me, it's me, it's me. It's okay. It's over now, it's done, okay. They're all still out there, all of them. They don't like what we did. We? You fucking tied me up! Olivia, please. They're going to hear us. Who? It's okay. We're gonna get you home, we're gonna get you help, okay? I'm gonna get you help. - I don't feel very good. - I know. You're okay, you're okay. - What is that? - It's okay. - What is that? - It's nothing, look at me. Look at me. We're gonna take you home, okay? It's nothing, it's nothing okay? Look at me, look at me, look at me. We're gonna get you home. I'm gonna take you home, okay? I want you to stand up. Stand up with me. We're gonna go home. We're gonna go home. They wanted him. We let him go. No, no, we did the right thing. Who are these people? That's who they are. Special dispensation, Liv. Lucy? Lucy. Lucy. Lucy.
