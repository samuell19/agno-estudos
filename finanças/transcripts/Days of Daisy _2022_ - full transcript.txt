So, Daisy Bea. Anything bothering you? Out of the ordinary? - Mm. Nope. - Good. -And how's Camille doing? -Uh... - She's Camille. - Yeah. We all just love her here. A wonderful lady. Now there's a bit of pressure here. Now, Daisy, still no children, huh? Not that I'm aware of. Seriously, though, no kids. Is that something that you're... Well, is that something that you're planning on? Yeah. Absolutely. One day. Always have. Excited about kids. I just don't want to rush it. Now, Daisy, I don't want to sound insensitive here, but one day... This is one of those "Now or never" type situations. -Really? -Mm-hmm. -Now or never? -Yeah. I don't want to startle you or anything, but... ...another year or so and, well... ...it'll just get harder and harder. Now it says here that you're still on birth control, right? -Yeah. -That's another hurdle. You don't just have the age working against you, but the hormonal imbalance. What's with all the age talk? If your birthday is correct here, it says to me that you're not thirty. Well, I'm in my thirties. So there's that. Almost 40? Right. No. Sure. Yeah. I know that. Okay, great. Then we're on the same page. Absolutely. Same page. May want to get that ball rolling. -It's Friday already? -The one day of the month that they don't all have their faces all shoved in their phones. - Rally! Rally! - Hey, come on. Come on, guys. This is a place of study and focus. No one cares. Not to be the bearer of bad news, but no one cares about you. That's not true. I do. Aw. That's just too cute, Daisy. Hey. I'll give it back to you when you learn to call me Miss Bea. I'm a teacher and you're a student. Learn a bit of respect. You're not a teacher. You're a, whatever, librarian, Miss Bea. Can have it back now? It'll be in the counselor's office after school. Come on, Sadie. Let's go. So rude. Oh, uh, your art du jour project. Oh, I always love these. So what's the latest passion in the class today? We are rounding out our scratch art projects. Pretty much my favorite form. It takes a steady hand. Oh. Cool. You have fun. So, how's everything with Stephen? -It's good. -That sounds like a dream relationship. Well, he keeps, you know, laying down these little "Let's take it slow" -or "Let's go with the flow" type jabs. -You should break up with him. -No, I can't. Just moved in. -I'm kidding. Wow. Not even a thought. That's impressive. Well, he loves horses, and, you know, horses are my weakness. -I think cruising along with the status quo is your weakness. -Ouch. I'm just saying, if you want different outputs, you need to try different inputs. -You know what I'm saying? -Mm. Inputs? You never want to settle down? We're still so young, Daze. Well, that's not what I've been hearing lately. All this talk about settling down comes from this generation who graduated high school, got married and... oozed out children. Your mother. The world is different now. Sure, but biology does not care if the world is different. Believe whatever you want to believe, and I will be here to support you. You gotta teach? Yep. I got jazz. You should come sometime. -I'll think about it. -I love you. I love you. Hm. Hey, do you need a hand? -Oh, yeah. -Oh, awesome. Oh! Oh. You're so lucky to get to babysit this little prince. Oh, no, he's mine. Thanks so much. Oh, sorry. Bye. Bye. - Hey, darling. - Frank! -Frank dear. -How's the-- How's the library? You need anything? - No, it's great. - Frank! How's the office? Mm. Stressful. -Hence the beer. -Mm. I guess I have a husband who's hard of hearing. Camille. Hello, dear. You staying for dinner, Daze? She's going to the cowboy's house. That's where I live. Sort of. A lot of stuff here. So how is it over there, anyway? How's Stephen? I haven't seen him in ages. Yeah, I know. I'm working on that. Oh, Daisy, don't make any plans for tomorrow night. -Why? -There's a photography exhibit for Jack Palmer. Up and coming. Everyone's raving about him. We can socialize a bit, rub some elbows, get you a new job. -She just said that she loves her job. -Yeah, I'm totally fine with it. The amount of fine you are with things really concerns me. 7:00 p.m. Already got us tickets. Fine. Mm. My parents invited you over for dinner soon. Your mom going to be there? Um, she counts as a parent. Yes. Mm. Have to think about that. What do you mean? It's not that she frightens me necessarily. -It's just-- She terrifies me. -What? She's just always so nervous. I think it's her eyes. Maybe you could get used to it 'cause it could be a very nice evening. Come on, Daisy. It's not like I don't want to be there. Sounds like it. It's... With my last girlfriend, everything went so fast, too fast. Hmm. We've been dating for a year. I just don't want to rush dinners. Okay? I, I, I just want to go with the flow. Hey. We've got a good thing going. We do, don't we? Okay. Same page? -Mm. -Do you want to maybe go, you know... How, how's that? That's good. Awesome. Well, yeah. - Hey, can we talk for a second? - Yeah. Sure. Now? Um, never mind. Keep going. -You sure? -Yeah. Yeah. Keep going. I feel like you're not sure. I'm super sure. Impressive. Thanks. Come on, August. Hurry up. Hey, where y'all going? The bell hasn't even rung yet. We're trying to get to third period early. Miss Bonneville has a big announcement to make. -Ooh. -We're hoping it's a new French easel. Hm. All right. Well, you're all here. May as well get this over with. Get what over with? I'm leaving you. Wait. - What? - I'm so sorry, but there has been a blatant disregard for what I've been trying to build here and I, I've had it. I can't finish this semester. Starting tomorrow, this class will serve as an open study period supervised by... I don't know who. You said you had good news. No, I said I had news. You supplied the good part. So no French easel? French easel? No. No. This is, like, our life. There's just a handful of you. No one has interest. I'm exhausted. I have been fighting and fighting for years, clawing to get more funding. I've invested more time and money than any teacher should. I love you kids, but it's too much for me now. Surely there's a grant, or donors or something. Who are you? I'm Daisy. Librarian. Hi. Oh, yeah, Daisy. You go find them. You go apply for them. I'm finished. This is bullshit. Oh, it's like an exponential crisis. - Existential. - Whatever. Just go take your piss. Gross. Sadie, on your way. Hey, guys, come on. I know it's a big blow, but it's not the end of the world. I thought you would actually care. I do care. I'm just saying it's going to work out. It doesn't seem like it. Isn't he brilliant? He certainly loves nude women. How do you reckon she got into that position? Trash compactor? I certainly admire his gumption, but he could at least put some clothes on at least a few of them. Oh, but that would be boring then, wouldn't it? Yeah, I can't say you're wrong there. -Where are you going? -Food. You already have food. That's my favorite piece. Oh, shit. Um, what did you say? The portrait that you're looking at, it's my favorite one. So vulnerable. I'm wondering how that's vulnerable. Well, you know, to expose yourself in that way, in that fashion, find the animal within. It's a woman in some mesh. So you don't think there's more to it than that? The animal thing is interesting. Maybe that's what he wants us to think. -He? -The photographer dude. Right. Yeah. Uh... I had heard that, um... Someone said she had to stay in that position for, like, over an hour. Much to his dismay, I'm sure. I don't follow. Lots of naked chicks. Well, come on. I mean, that's-- It's all for the art, I suppose. -Right. The sacrifice. -Exactly. I should, uh, talk to a few more guests, but this was-- Well, I didn't... -Oh, Daisy. -Daisy. -That's a nice name. -Thanks. Why do you have to go and...? Shit. You're Jack Palmer? Have a nice night, Daisy. It looked like he was flirting with you. -We have to go. -What? Why? I just insulted him. Oh, it didn't look like that to me. -It looked like flirting. -I have a boyfriend. Oh, I'll find out if he's single. I know I'm saying words, and there's air coming out of my mouth. They just don't seem to land. Great. Thanks. Mm. Mm. Mm. Oh, handsome. You all right? Did I do something? No. I'm okay. Mm. Smell good. Well, ain't it? It's been a while since we've, uh, caught up since the move. You know, you're right. It has just been "Go, go, go," hasn't it? Well, that's putting it lightly. What do you want to talk about? Well, how's life? It's fun. It's, it's good now that you're here. That's about it, I guess. Mm. Cool. Anything else on your mind? Mm, no, not really. Mm. Okay? I'm just gonna splunk right into it. I went to the doctor's office the other day and... ...he said, um, that I don't have much time. What are you telling me, Daisy, are you dying? No. Gynecologist. No cancer or anything. -Just egg stuff. -Oh, well, thank God. I mean, don't say eggs stuff, but, I mean, good for, you know, not dying and all. Yeah, uh, listen, I'm about to be 40, and so biology has a way of... -Oh. -Yeah. And he said that if I wanted to have kids, I really need to start thinking about that, and... I'm not saying "Hey, let's make a baby right now." I just... -Not at all. -Okay. Well, thank God. Well, I just want to see if that was something that... ...you know, you might... Okay. Uh, I'll be honest. Maybe, I don't know. I'd want to be married first. Um, and we agreed to take it slow. And I always liked the idea of living with someone for a little while before I made that decision. So... Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, sure. You mad at me? I mean, I've told you my rationale from the get-go. Yeah. And I told you mine. I wanted kids one day. -Wait a minute. That's not fair. -No, this is my fault. I should have talked about this before my lease was up and I just moved in. I didn't know there was gonna be such a hard deadline. Gosh, time is such a bitch. I didn't know that having kids was that important to you. Yeah. Uh, I don't know what to say right now, Daisy. Back to square one. Not necessarily. I-- Do you or don't you want kids? Yes or no? No gray area, please. Then you should've said that from the beginning. I'll stay with my parents. Get my stuff out of here. Wait, are, are we breaking up? I don't see any reason to waste any more time. Well... -Dang. -Dang is not the perfect thing to say right now, Stephen. I know. I'm sorry. It's just... Suddenly, I'm not all that hungry. Me neither. What do you think that's about? Square one. Miss Bea, are you okay? Oh, yeah, I'm fine. You guys? Besides hating life, you mean? At least you have a purpose. Not for the next hour. Not for the next life. Hey, where's my art du jour ? Come in. -Oh, hey, Daze. -Hey. I wanted to ask you about Miss Bonneville leaving. -I mean, the kids had just gutted. -Oh, yeah. She shouldn't have said all that. Wasn't supposed to come out till the end of semester, and I was supposed to make the announcement. Can't you just give her the resources she needs to finish it out? -That would at least give us a little-- -You know I love you, Daze. But this isn't some fancy high school you pay tuition for. Or one that pays for supplies. We're public. -Yeah. -And public schools are a business. And in Louisiana, investments are made in programs with interest. -Football. -Football. Sports. Hell, women's volleyball is doing pretty well. But aside from, what, eight students in the arts program, I hate say it, but who cares? -Dad! -I'm sorry, but when I weigh eight versus 2,000 fans in the stands on Friday, -it's a no brainer. -During World War II, they asked Winston Churchill-- They asked him to cut funding for the arts, and he said, "But then what would we be fighting for?" I'm the one who told you about that quote. Well? It's money. Relevance. You know I'm a big supporter of the arts, Daze, but I also know where I stand as principal of this institution, which is, after all... -A business. -Exactly. Is there anything else I can do for you, hon? I imagine you have other things to worry about more than this. No, I'm trying not to think about it. I don't know. Well, maybe this, uh, well, change in routine will help with some perspective. Maybe you're right. See you tonight. I said it already. You know, I'm exhausted. I mean, I, I, I can't even get the most basic materials. Brushes, good paper, non-huffable glue, huh. Coach Davis snaps his fingers and pfft, your dad comes crawling. It's just not that simple, Miss Bonneville. You're a grown woman. Call me Helen. Okay, Helen, um, the kids are devastated. They will find their way. I don't know that they will without you. I mean, can't you just stay until December? I don't know. Run through all the materials and supplies. A grace period. Uh, it's all so lifeless, isn't it? Politics. Money. Who cares about getting a well-rounded education, right? You know, I think I've earned the time to paint and write, - and... - who knows, maybe even act. But the teaching no, no. I've run out of energy for it. You seem to really care about them. Why don't you help them? I wouldn't even know where to begin. You know what I tell all my artists? Get creative. So, first you come to my show -and you insult my photography... -Yeah, I'm sorry. ...and then you're just going to show up out of nowhere, -and you're going to ask me for help? -Yep. See? I like that. That's bold. -Wow. That is a beautiful picture. -Hmm. - Look at that. They're so cute. - Yeah. Smiles are mesmerizing, aren't they? Captured it in Angola. Think it kind of has this glimmer of hope in a devastating time. Through family. Well, didn't expect that from you. Yeah, it's not all naked women. Unfortunately, your story, it's not all that unfamiliar to me. These arts programs, they keep getting cut. It's bit of a national trend. -Hm. -So what were you thinking? Uh, keep in mind, too. I'm a freelancer. So, like, schedules, not really my jam. I totally get it. The class meets three times a week, only for an hour. But right after lunch. Eight kids? What's your play on all this? I think I'm really close to two of them. -You think? -Yeah, it's hard to tell with teenagers, but it was the collective look that "Armageddon is near" on their faces when the teacher quit, so... -I guess you never know what they could become. -Exactly. -Like, their effect on the world. -Yes. Okay, uh, let's see. Hmm. It's tough. I'm saving up for this trip to Haiti in January, so I kind of have to hold on to all the cash flow I can get. Uh, plus, I got to be some sort of fiscally responsible. -I could pay if it helps. -Oh, no, no, no, sorry, that's, that's not what I meant. -It's just like if, uh, commission were to come up-- -It's done. -We're paying you. -Mm. They cut the funding for the program. I guarantee the school is not going to cover the costs. Don't worry about it. It's handled. Got it. -Okay. Uh, how? -Would that do it? I mean, I don't know if I feel comfortable. I mean, you get to help some kids uncover their creative selves and get some money. Would that do it? Yeah. Okay. See you Monday. One o'clock. Monday, one o'clock. So, he volunteers one hour every three days, for the rest of the semester. Then what? I don't know. I figured it's a great start. It's a good start. I'm just thinking long term here. -I don't have a full-fledged plan yet. -Daisy. You're right. I haven't done anything like this before, so-- -And I understand that-- -You know what? I'll chew on it tonight and I'll let you know. - Daisy! - Oh, my Lord, Mom. What? You've been ignoring our guest. Well... lovely meatloaf. I'm sorry, Bradley. I don't know what my mother has told you, -bless her heart-- -I know you didn't just say bless her heart. But she doesn't seem to care that I just broke up with my boyfriend last night. So I'm on hiatus while I try to help some of my students. -Not your students. -My kids, then. Nope. Don't have any of those, either. What's the... ...what's the long term plan to keep the class? I'm willing to work with you here, Daze, but this is your show, -and I'm just not going to-- -Show? Yeah, your show. I'm a very busy man. So I'm not-- I could put on an art show. A silent auction, raise money that way. Preposterous. I'm sorry, Bradley. Get real money for supplies. Maybe create some more buzz. -Get more students interested. -Okay. Okay. Okay. Date, time? I don't know. I just thought of it like five seconds ago. This is a big distraction, if you ask me. - We'll need all the time we can get. - -And rude. December 13th, last Friday before the end of semester. Art show. Just need a time. I don't know. 7:00 p.m.? 7:00 p.m. it is. Clock's ticking. Don't expect my help with any of this. Don't worry, I'm not. You should get back to your guest. Ouch. This is really good meatloaf. Oh, Bradley, stuff it! Uh, Miss Bea... ...where's this Jack Palmer guy? He'll be here. He's probably just running late. I hope so. No disrespect, Miss Bea. But what if this guy doesn't show up? What do you know about art? Um... Let me check. Daisy! Eat. I'm not that hungry anymore. More for me. So it went well? It was rough. But I'm going to nail it on Wednesday. Even if Jack doesn't show up. Yeah, absolutely. You know, I would start by organizing this place. It's got scatterbrain written all over it. Mm, yeah, well, that's Bonneville. We need a fresh start, change things up. Narrow the focus. Well, let's get started, shall we? -We? -Yeah. I want to bask in your newfound excitement too. Aw. - Hey. - Hey, Mr. Bea. Pulling some after hours, huh? Yep. About to whip this place into shape. I see you've got food. I'll let your mother know. Dinner in the classroom. after a first day, the life of a true educator. I'll see you at home. Absolutely not. Look, I've come to terms with the fact that I'm getting older. So there's a plan C. You might just like it. Donor insemination. We get a jump start on the process. I might need your help raising the child if Mr. Right doesn't come along first. Doesn't have to be A-B-C. Maybe it's ACB. That's not the proper way. I just got off birth control, Mom. I'm trying here. I saw them in the trash. Why the change of heart? Does it really matter to you? How much? Is tomorrow still looking rough? These kids need you. I have no clue what I'm doing. I mean, you could give me a paintbrush and I'd try to eat rice with it. Here. Oh, God. And I may have promised my dad that we're putting on an art show in December. So there's that. I'm sorry. What? A silent auction, you know, to sell the kids' work to rai-- raise money for the program. I mean, I told him that you and I would put it together. Do you always speak for other people or is that sort of a new thing? It's a new thing. Mm. Cool. Okay, the hard walkout thing, it's not gonna work every time. -That's what you got. -I told you. I was hoping for an after-school shopping trip. Um, I have a little budget for that. Oh. Whoa, Miss Bea! Love what you did with the place! Yeah. It looks like someone actually cares. Uh... Uh, okay. Well, we are getting started a little bit behind, but that's good. I always find that the creative mind thrives with an uphill battle. You throw your inhibitions away and you just-- you go with it. Some people are going to say that that's winging it, but... ...I say organic. Now, do we have limited supplies? Yeah. Yeah, that's putting it lightly. But... ...you don't need a high-end studio to create something that's visceral. We will get more supplies to create a one-of-a-kind show. But until then... ...this is your centerpiece. This is what the entire exhibit is going to revolve around. What piece? With those supplies, and this trash... ...and the time we have between now and the exhibit. Tell me something, but with a sculpture, All right, guys, let's get to work. Uh, what do you want it to say with the sculpture? We're not done yet. When we snap a photo, we are looking for the way the light falls. Sure. Composition. All of that. But most importantly, we are looking for a moment in time. That look on someone's face, right? Something you couldn't manufacture even if you try. Such a good start for everybody today. Really. Just so good. And scoop, scoop. Open, open. Very good. Keep going. Keep going. Eyes up, boys. Yep. We're shooting this within a week. -Hey. -How's it going? -I feel good. -No, with the kids. Oh, yeah, they're cool. I could really use some with a little less self-awareness. Chad, buddy, loosen it up a little bit. Oh, we have to get back to the studio, so... -All right. -It's nice to see you. -Yeah. -Thanks for having us. Yeah. Bye, Jack. I know. I know. Okay, bye. All right. Let's just do this all again, shall we? I was jealous. Well... Oh, I haven't eaten anything all day. Would you want to go grab something? Absolutely. -Okay. -Yes. That's all you. Well, not actually, come on. -You gotta save some of that for me. -Look, those are three berries. -I'm getting one. -All right. Right. So... Mm. Been a while since I've shared dessert with someone. Yeah? I haven't been on a date... ...in a long time. Well, who says this is a date, mister? Oh, no... - Sorry. - I'm kidding. Oh. I have to ask you a question that kind of puts me in the gallows. But... ...you know, uh, about that check that I gave you. -Oh. -I was just wondering when you were going to-- or if you have deposited it. You're talking about this check? Yeah. Great. So, uh, do you know when you're going to...? Yeah. Wait. What are you doing? I don't want it. What do you mean you don't want it? I don't want it. - Well, isn't that the whole reason why you showed up? Okay. All right. Yeah. Well, fine. I feel like a jerk about that. Well, you're forgiven. Thank you. And... ...I see why you went to bat for these kids. They are pretty great, huh? Yep. It makes you think, though. About what? Like... ...if I had a kid, right? Like some, you know, just a toddler running around, wreaking havoc all over the place. Or, or if you did. -Go on. -Well, how difficult... ...that would make what we're doing for these kids. But, uh... ...now, you know, we're able to help eight of them. So, yeah, I mean... Thank you. Cheers. To the kids. To the kids. Also to this cheesecake. -Hey. -I told you I'm not gonna share. You do it yet? Mom? How long have you been standing there? No. They recommend that you wait at least a month so you're off birth control. Even if I didn't know that was bullshit-- -Whoa! -I'd say it has been a month. Uh, well, time flies, huh? Do I really need to say clock's ticking again? You're single. Fine. But what about your ACB proposal? And you're wasting your time with that ludicrous art project. I called all the insemination clinics. No inquiries on your behalf. That's frightening. Your focus is not in the right place. You're acting like you're living in the glory days again, Well, maybe 39 is my glory days. Plus, if it makes you feel any better, I went on a date last night with Jack, and I was happy. Jack Palmer? He's a tomcat, a, a, a player. Everyone knows this. You seemed all about it at his art show. According to my bridge club, he gets around. Your bridge club? You're wasting your time. You said you wanted a child. Remember? Someone to nurture. I was 16. Then you were 24 and then you were 30. Well, maybe I'm not as with that anymore. With that? You're lying to yourself. -This must be a phase. -What if it's not? Well, then, I want my money back. No, You know what? You keep it. It'll help you. -With what? -Moving cost. Rent. Some place else. Eden! - Mm. - Coffee! Mm. Fine. I think I need to talk to Jack about the kid thing. Daisy, it is way too early for this. Fine. Eat a bagel. You eat a bagel. Fine, sure. I waited a whole year to talk to Stephen about this and look where it got me. It opened the opportunity for you to meet Jack, who is fun. And creative. -And... -Sexy. Sexy. And you just had your first date last night. If you go through this and that guy doesn't run for the hills, I will completely question that guy's sanity. I just need to know if it's something that he wants, you know, someday. There's no harm in that. Okay. I say this as someone who loves and trusts and is consistently confused by you, it's a bad idea. But Jack's different. I mean, he's kind and understanding, and he's in tune with himself. And I feel like time is running out for me. I have this literal feeling. Okay, I'm going to create an app that goes straight to your brain that warns me of your next thought and why you're having it. Like the weather app, but Daisy's brain. -I'm gonna ask him. -You have selective hearing, you know that? Thank you for talking me through this. It was very helpful. Selective hearing. Bye. Psst. Hey. Daisy? -Lunchtime yet. -Hmm. - Uh, about four minutes. - Oh. Mm. So I think a guy like you would want full disclosure. Yeah? Oh. A guy like me? I'm potentially about to ruin something great. How so? Simply by talking. Never knew a civil conversation could do that. Look, Daze, if it makes you feel any better about whatever's on your mind, you know, I am an artist, sure, but I'm rational, you know? I do listen. Just spit. Well, my ex-boyfriend, about a day before I came waltzing into your studio-- Oh, no. Jealousy issues? -Stalker? -No. We actually separated after being together for about a year. Oh, so it was serious. -Well, I thought so. -Mm-hmm. And we had the discussion about having kids, and we decided to just end it. Well, that is a... That's a big relief. I'm really relieved to hear that. Wait. Why? Well, um... Okay. So based on our conversation from the other night... Whoa. All right. I just figured I would get it off my chest. I had a vasectomy, like, two years ago. So... I mean, it's good to be on the same page, assuming things were to move forward, which hoping they do... Oh. Oh, you were the one who wanted kids. What made you think otherwise? We cheers-ed our coffees. We talked about helping a lot of kids. Sorry, I just-- I was completely under the impression-- So you never want kids since we're assuming things from our date? Okay. Can we slow down? Right? 'Cause this is happening really fast. -Well? -No. Then no. I like my life how it is. And who would be stupid enough to bring a kid into this world anyway? So I'm stupid for wanting kids? No, I-- No, I didn't mean that. I just... Daisy. I mean, we just had our first date, and it was an impromptu one. Where is this coming from? It's coming from the fact that I don't have time... ...to figure out what the hell it is that I want. I'd love to be with you for a year. But then... ...if I brought this up then... Dream world, it's you and a kid. You got a very unorthodox sense of timing. We're old. We should be honest with each other by now. We're not that old. I'm really sorry about any misunderstanding, and I... I completely understand where you're coming from. Stop being so nice. You're making it worse. Just rational. -Business as usual. -Of course. Hey, Mr. P, I got an idea for my third piece. I'm going to change it up a bit. Cool. Oh, yeah, yeah. Hey, can't wait to see that. Is that sandwich spicy, Miss Bea? You're tearing up. Super spicy. -Hey. -Hey. Hey, guys. -Hey. -Hey. Shit. -You have to go? -I promise, I, I didn't plan it like this, but... yeah. -Okay. Go. -I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. Um, Sadie, excuse me. What are you doing? So I just got transferred to this class because, well, home ec sucks. Can I come inside? Uh... Cool. There has to be something you can do, Dad. Don't call me that here. Oh, because it's such a secret. Let me be Frank. Sorry. This is kind of funny because my name is Frank. I know, Dad. Sorry. My hands are tied, Daze. -She's a bully. -No, she's a student. She tortures August and Maddie. Well, then, it's your duty as a teacher to mold her into a compassionate human being. -Me? -Yes, you, Jack, whoever else is helping. Jack had to step out for the day. Then, quick question. -Yeah. -Who's watching your kids? Oh. Oh, uh... You're not an artist. You're an idiot. Say that to my 5,000 followers. Hi, all. I'm-- -Excuse me? -Go hike up your skirt for another five likes. -Maddie. -I mean, I would, but Daisy's got my phone. Good. Maybe you can use your brain for once. Okay, everybody just stop! Go back to your projects. Well, what about me? What about you, Sadie? Lord, please bless this food to the nourishment of our body. Please watch over Mom, or please help Daddy find his teeth. Amen. So, um... ...your mom tells me you're trying to get pregnant. - Oh, Lordy! Are you okay? - Stanley, you goof. Sorry. Sit. Don't get up. - Oh. - I'm fine. - I'm sorry. I, I, I didn't mean-- - Stanley, stop it. If only most men were so forthcoming. Mom, you're laying it on a little thick. You told me to set this up. So, Stanley, quick question. Is there an office poll for when I'll get knocked up? Well... - Is she this crazy at work? Uh, sometimes. Yeah. I'm sorry she dragged you into this. No, I got a good roast out of it. I'm not good at this kind of stuff. So I'm sorry if I acted a fool in there. No, no, not at all. It's just, like, you're real nice and, and pretty funny and all, and... Yeah, I might not be the right guy for you, but it's just... - I, I know I'm direct-- - That's great. Yeah? It's just-- You know, I don't want to be 70 when my kid graduates high school. Um, could, could I call you sometime? Yeah. Let's take it slow. We don't have to jump in bed right this minute. Yeah. I wouldn't know what to do if we did. I'm kidding. I've totally had intercourse before. Hey. I know today was kind of a weird one, but, uh... -...can we straighten a couple things out? -Sure. Okay. You and me, we do not always see eye to eye on everything. But I think that we had, or have, a real connection. - It's effortless and-- - Hey, Daisy! Late lunch for milady. -Oh, thank you. -Mm. Uh, yeah. I'm sorry. I should be going. Wait. Are you sure? Yeah. Well, don't forget we have that meeting at the venue after school. So I will, in fact, see you later. Great. -Uh, you're a lifesaver. -Mm. Yeah. What's, uh, what's this? No idea. So... ...I will need a deposit on the space no later than the seventh. It's a popular spot for Christmas parties. You all are able to load in the dock out back the night before. However, I will need everything out by 8:00 a.m. the next morning. Right? I will give you all a minute. So what's with the photograph? You seemed to like it. I did. Thanks. Then you like my dream. Sorry. Uh, Hannah, can we just get, like, a quick moment alone? Sure. Uh, my daughter will be here at seven and then I... We'll need to leave. It was right after Angola, the vasectomy. Hm. If I had a kid of my own, I know that I would love that kid so damn much that I wouldn't be able to focus on anything else except parenting. Oh, I see a whirlwind. Maybe you could do both. I want to help thousands of kids over my life. I know that's not traditional, but... ...if I could give that many children just, like, a sliver of joy, of hope. Well, then, that's my dream. And I meant what I told you in the library. I see something really special with you. Look, I don't want to be unfair to your dream. It's just, for now, it's too difficult. Being around you, knowing all of this... ...that I'm special to you, it's just... Okay, so, what do we do? You've done so much for these kids already, so you can just go help the next ones. Well-- No, what do you mean? No, I'm going to follow through on this. Plus, you have no idea how to put on a show by yourself. Maybe that's good. Maybe I'll bring a new perspective to the art scene. Keep an eye out for the invite. Okay? I'd love to see you here. Sincerely. I know how I'm coming off. It's just what I need right now. You got a real knack for ending things, huh? Mom, I'm here. Jack is our ace in the hole, Miss Bea. How are we going to do this without him? Everyone just calm down! Yeah. I mean, we worked our tails off for this, and he just cuts and runs? It's not like that. It's not on him. It's on me. Okay? And why exactly is it on you, Miss Bea? What? Thanks for sitting here with me. Silence is really nice. A lot of noise in my life lately. -Mm. -You know you're killing it, right? Thanks. You're really kind. I saw your dance video. It's so good. -Really? -Yeah. Yeah. Ah. Oh. Our venue. - Hey, Miss George, what's up? - Daisy. Hi. Look, I just wanted to give you a quick call to let you know that the gallery, it was already booked -on the day that you had reserved it. -I, I'm sorry. What? Yeah. Unfortunately, it's just not going to work out the way we hoped. Oh, no, no, no. You can't do this right now. No, no. Don't you worry your pretty little head about it. I will have that deposit back to you ASAP. I don't want my deposit back. I want the space for the show, like we discussed. I mean, the kids, they're really depending on this. I am sorry. That is just not possible. Well, what about some other date? Like, anything other-- You know, I've got another call buzzing in, but I'm so glad that we could work this out. Work what out? Thank you so much for understanding. Namaste. Hm. That little brat. What happened? Yeah. Hi. I was wondering if you have any availability in December? The entire month is full? Wow. No, there won't be any open flames. Alcohol? No, it's a kids' show. That's just the insurance cost? That's-- A little over our budget. Never mind. Uh-huh. Are you actually laughing at me? It's a high school art show, and our other venue bailed, so-- No, I... Please? There has to be. They're kids! And goodbye to you too! Any luck? No. Everyone's either blocked or-- Way too expensive? Yeah, same here. We'll figure it out, Daze. Yeah, Thanks so much for your help. Oh. Miss Bea, uh, you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I, I just hit a tiny little bump in the road. what happened? Well, we lost our venue. It's double-booked. What? That venue was our ace in the hole. You said that Jack was your ace in the hole. Yeah, well, I thought we lived in a world - where there could be two aces in one hole. What are we gonna do now? Uh, well, we'll keep calling places. Ask around. You sure that'll work? Yeah, of course. - I learned today that teaching nine kids is pure hell. -You're living the dream compared to other teachers. -Mm. You could only have to worry about one. Just saying. Remind me, Mom, where do you stand on the whole me-getting-pregnant thing? I forgot. You miss the library full-time? I do a little. It was simple. Life is good when it's simple. Took me a while to learn that. Okay. Consider this a trial run, Stanley. Just to gauge. Okay? Just some checkpoint questions. Do you drink? Uh, not much, no, uh... Occasional shot of Boone's Farm to take the edge off. And how's your count? Huh? Sperm? Oh, uh... It's all there, I think. And do you secretly smoke? Never once. Hm. Oh. Uh... What? Nothing. What? I've never done this before, Daisy. Wait. Really? I, I thought you said you had. Well, are you okay? Oh, it's-- Well, you know, when you said you didn't want to hop into bed this instant, I, I, I just didn't think it'd be this soon. But-- -We can wait. -No. Let's do this thing. Okay. Okay. Wh-- What do I do next? Phew! Well, goodnight, Stanley. Goodnight, Daisy. Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, my God! That felt great. -Don't look at me like that. -Like what? He's nice. - Yeah. - -Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed. I miss when you were just a librarian. I can't keep up. -Me neither. -Just think. He'll remember last night for the rest of his life. Which is halfway over. Maybe you just needed to do this so you could realize that you really want Jack. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Let's just hope old Stanley boy didn't get you preggers in the meantime. Oh, my God, I was just kidding. You used protection, right? Listen, I, I think I need a favor. I, I forgot. I have a doctor's appointment today. Okay. I need you to go to school and be with the kids right after lunch. And keep th-- keep thinking of venues we can call, you know, for the show. What? Daze? Just breathe, Miss Bea. We'll get you sorted out. Okay? Okay. Yeah. Come in. Hi. Are you Daisy? It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Upadhya. Thanks for coming to see me today. Okay, look, if I have cancer, just rip the band aid off and tell it to me straight. You don't have cancer. I knew it. No, you don't have cancer. Oh, good. Thank God. I did look at your lab results. Your urine analysis was normal. Your pregnancy test was negative. On your pelvic ultrasound, though, you did have uterine fibroids and ovarian cysts. Given that you came in in so much pain, we can't rule out endometriosis. Good thing I know what all that is. It's a fairly common condition, and until we know for sure, I can manage it with some pain meds which we can send to your pharmacy. But the thing I wanted to talk to you about was, I noted in your history, you've never been pregnant before? Okay. Um, is that something that you're interested in or concerned about? Yes. Wait. Yes. Will I be able to? I honestly can't tell you for sure right now. I'd have to refer you to a specialist. The way they diagnose endometriosis is through a laparoscopic surgery. But if you're interested in knowing your fertility, we can work that up in a number of ways. Oh. This is a lot. I know. Um, to be blunt with you, Daisy, given your advanced maternal age, the odds aren't exactly in your favor. For what? So you're almost forty. A man, he can have a baby when he's 30, 40, 80. - Right. - Women, we're screwed. Once we hit 35, we're what's known as an elderly primigravida. -Elderly? -I know. It's gross. But basically, it means once we hit that age, the odds of having a viable pregnancy drop significantly. So it's not impossible, but we really need to gauge your priorities. I have so many questions. Okay, take your time. If I have endometriosis, what are my options? If it's a mild case, they often recommend a surveillance approach. Everything you say sounds like Star Trek to me. Okay. I'm sorry. Basically, it means watch, wait and see. If it's a moderate case, they recommend endometrial ablation or hormone injections. If it's a severe case, it often requires a hysterectomy. I don't want to scare you, but I really think we should prepare ourselves for the worst case scenario here. - You're ruining the class for all of us. Okay, okay. Everybody, calm down. -Calm down? -It's Sadie's stupid fault we don't have a venue because she went whining to Mommy. - We don't know that. - Yes, we do. We called the venue like we were potential customers. There's nothing booked on those days. It was completely free. And then we realized, "Oh, it's her mom." Well, that's actually pretty good detective work. -You bitch! -What? You're going to cry now? -Okay, stop it. -You ruined everything, Sadie. - What the hell do you have against us? - -Hey! What's with all the noise? Everything stops this instant. I don't think I can do the show anywhere, Mr. Bea. What? Daze, what's wrong? How did the doctor go? Are you kidding, Miss Bea? You're our third ace in the hole. You really need to find a different metaphor. Until further notice, I'm out. Eden, you take care of everything. Dad, you do it, or-- Kids, I don't care. Miss Bea, you can't give up on us. I know that it's been stressful-- -If she wants to go, let her go. -Shut up, Sadie. Okay, look, it's been a long day, okay? Just go home. Get some rest. You were the only one that made this fun, Miss Bea. Please? Whoever did that to her work... ...you're better than that. Daze. Daze, Daze. Hold up a second. Listen... ...I know you're going through a lot right now, I mean, with, with the kids, uh, your mother, the, the show. But, well, listen, you can't just say, "Hey, Eden, cover for me." I mean, she's not a registered sub. I can get in some serious trouble, you know? I know, I'm sorry. It's just... -We lost our venue and-- -W-- Wait, Wait. -What? When did this happen? -It doesn't matter. I've called everywhere. Everything's booked. Okay. Okay. Well-- So what? I mean, you don't have to have some fancy gallery, Daze. I'm sure we'll find something. It's art. I mean, hell, you could hang it from the trees in the Garden District or, or burn it in a bonfire at Dubai. -You could be very avant-garde. -Dad. All right. What about Jack? -We could use his studio. -No, Dad. Whatever. Just don't let this be an excuse to quit. All right? Those kids are counting on you. So let's buck up, figure this thing out and finish what you started. Dad, it's not just that. Kiddo, what? What-- Oh. You should've seen her today, Cammie. She just seemed so defeated. Well, she can still freeze her eggs. All is not lost. You're not going to bring that up again now, are you? I'm just saying. Let me give you a little information. Your daughter is doing a fantastic job with those kids, and I can't recall the last time I've, I've seen her so excited or lively about anything. She's been happy. Hell, the only time I see her stressed or anxious is when you're hounding her. I mean, shouldn't, shouldn't it be your goal as a mother to see your daughter happy? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm going to support her. Because our daughter is doing something great. And I couldn't be more proud of her. Hey, you've reached Jack. Sorry I missed you. You can leave me a message, and I'll call you back. Hey, Jack. Hi. It's Daisy. Um... I know it's been a minute, but I had something I really need to talk to you about. Give me a call. Uh, I hope you're well. Okay. We can do this. Yeah. Oh, Jack. Hey, I'm, I'm at the school right now, but is there any way that we could meet up in, like, 30 minutes? I have this huge favor I need to a-- What? What? This is... Oh, my gosh, Jack. Pretty wild, huh? -You are so lucky to be here. -I know. I know. You know, Jack... ...you have a real unorthodox sense of timing. Why didn't you call me? They're taking good care of me here. And, you know, with your show coming up, -I don't want to bother you. -Hey, no. Our show? Yeah, but... Look, Jack, I'm so sorry about everything. I know I've been all over the place. And-- Daze, you doing okay? No, no. Don't worry about me. I do though. I can't help but worry about you, like, all the time. Daisy... ...just talk to me. I don't think kids are happening. But you getting in the crash and... ...being here now looking like this... ...maybe it's a sign or something. I don't know. -Now you are talking crazy. -Ah. Maybe I am, but... ...I got two pieces of horrible news today. And the thought of losing you was the worst one. You know? Does that make sense? Well... - ...I'm happy that my pain can be a sign for you. Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry. I just realized how that came off. -I'm not-- -I'm kidding. So what happens next? Do you... Wow, Jack, you look like shit. Hey, language! Sorry. Are you okay? I mean, your wounds kind of suit you. Oh, they do, huh? Well, I mean, it's, It's kind of badass. Yes, I am fine. Guys, thank you. Thank you for all these gifts. Yeah, uh, gift shop had, like, the most basic options. So... Yeah. Well, it's the thought that counts. Absolutely. So... how are you feeling? The show's right around the corner. Tell me everything. You guys ready? - What, did I say something? - Well... ...we might have had, like, a little, tiny hiccup. We had a catastrophic hiccup. We lost our venue. What? -How? Wait. What happened? -Well... -...it's complicated. -It's my fault. I'm sorry. And the venue's actually booked now. I begged my mom, but there was nothing she could do. So why do you try to sabotage us? I don't know. At first, I thought it was a funny joke, but then I was standing in the room full of people who hated me. Whatever. Here. -The gift shop had the most basic options. -Right? Mm. I'm sorry, guys. All is lost then... Nothing's going to be available on such short notice. I'm sorry. You did your best. Or you could use my place. -Are you sure? -Am I sure? -Yeah. Are you kidding? -Oh, my God. I told you Jack was our ace in the hole. Oh, we're back on, huh? Pretty close. We're on. I'm going to go to school, do a, a big e-mail blast, uh, print some flyers. I'm so proud of you. I don't expect you to help. I-- Let's talk hors d'oeuvres. The bridge club gals are ready to do the cooking. So, is this a good time? One HD projector for milady. - Thank you, Stanley. You are a lifesaver. Yeah. So I, I can come over and help you set it up. Oh, that's okay. August is, like, a whiz of this kind of stuff, -so... -All right. Oh, and one more thing. About the other night, I just want to let you know that, -you know, I'm going through a lot of stuff-- -Let me stop you right there. You have nothing to worry about. I'm a reformed man. You sure? Crystal. Clear. -What? -See you at the show tonight. Okay, I wouldn't miss it for a software convention. Good luck! Bend. Nice. Go round. Very nice, Sadie. And reach. Reach, reach, reach, reach... Hey, all! Come out to the art show tonight. We've been working really hard, and we're just dying to see you. Right, August? We are dying. Yes. Every single one of you should be proud. We did it. Your work is so beautiful. I'm so proud of you, and I don't care what happens tonight. If we sell one painting... I just want you to be proud. Just be proud, okay? All right, let's mingle. Well, look who got creative. -Helen! -Hi. -Oh, my gosh. -Hoping to raise enough money to convince you to come back. Oh, no, my dear. I could never do this. This is you. You and your team. Your passion. Your purpose, Daisy. I'm just an old crone. Oh, stop! Miss Bonneville! - Hi! Hey! -We have to show you our stuff. -Oh, I'd love to see it. -Thank you for coming. -Well done to you. Daisy, what a turnout! I can't believe this. Look. Those are the principals from some of the Magnet Schools. -Oh, that's amazing. -You did that. -You did that. -Aw. It's so, uh... ...poetic. I choreographed it. Oh, did you now? Of course. Yeah, you did. -Mm. -Hey, guys. Oh, hey, Daisy. We're having a great time. This is awesome. Cool. - You looked so good. - Oh, thank you. He looks like trouble. You want me to get rid of him? Look at you. Ouch. Yeah. You saved us. Thank you. Daisy, I gave you a key. Hey, Miss Bea, I think we should do it. Yeah, like, right now. You ready? We're not done yet. Bring it on. Everybody, quiet down. Thank you. Come this way. I want to thank you all for coming out for the inaugural West High School Art gala hosted by none other than Jack Palmer. The students' final piece is called We're not done yet. It was created by the entire art class as a unit, cobbled together from things forgotten. We hope you get it. With your support, we would love to add more creative minds. But even without it, well, we'll find a way. So, uh, no pressure. Wait, wait. We need to thank our mentors. Mr. Palmer, thank you for letting us use your studio, and of course, for your knowledge behind the lens. Ah. Give me a bump. Phew. And a big thanks to Miss Eden for your free-flowing spirit. Aw! Thank you. But of course, of course, -the biggest thanks of all has to go to... -Miss Bea. Thank you for believing in us. And never giving up on us. We don't know what we would've done without you. Thanks, guys. Come on. Oh! -Drive safe. -Of course. And no texting. Hey, Jack, are we still on for tomorrow? Yeah. Four o'clock. Bring that Pentax. Yeah. Aw, thanks so much for coming, guys. -It was fun, Miss Bea. -Oh, good. Yeah. Your new place is awesome. Oh, thanks. Bye. Wow. Stragglers, am I right? Come on. Bye, guys. -Happy birthday! -Bye. -Do you want to sit? -Oh, sure. Yeah. Careful. Feeling okay? You need anything? I'm good. A little sore, but I'm on the up and up. Hmm. Well, first birthday party in the new house. Check. - First glass of wine on the front steps. -Check! What else is on the docket? I got a few little things. Practice exam, -certification. -Wait. Are you telling me that you're not yet a legal teacher? More art shows... ...probably a bunch of teenage angst before summer. So much to do. So little time. We have plenty of time. But there is one thing that can't wait. Oh, yeah? We've got to get on those weeds in the back. - No! - Yes. No. No way. Can we just ask your mom to do that? No. She'll tell us to get a new yard. Ugh. I miss the loft life. Cheers to pulling weeds. No. How about... ...here is to... ...our new little normal. So long as you're happy with that, Daze.
