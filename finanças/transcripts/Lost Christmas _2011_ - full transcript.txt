- I heard a dog. - Did you? It must be outside. - Dad! We were gonna hide him till tomorrow, but he didn't want to go along with the plan, did you? Happy Christmas, sweetheart. What are you going to call him, love? - I don't know yet. - Hi, little one. You want to take him out? - Yeah! - Come on then. Let's go. Get some clothes on. - Here boy. - What, sick? Yeah. Again. Yeah. Of course. In 10, in 10. Right. Cheers. Sorry, Goose. I'll make it up to you. Promise. Linda! I have to go into work, love. Mother, have you seen my keys? No, sorry. I can't find them anywhere. Goose, you seen my keys, mate? - No, Dad. Lind, you're going to have to drive me in, love. - He'll be fine. - Yep. - No. It's too sad. - Take Langford, it's quicker. - Know it all. You all right, mate? Hey. Anthony, you OK? - Ahhhh. It's snowing. - Not in Manchester, mate. It just rains. - A monkey. Snowing. With an angel's head. Snowing monkeys. Yeah. I'll watch out for them. - Hey. Mutt. Come on, Mutt. What are you doing, Nan? Well it's not going to cook itself, is it darling? That's the washing machine, Nan. Oven is there. And it's only Christmas Eve. - Christmas Eve. Yeah. Nan. I'll help you, tomorrow. I will. Oh, and put it back in the fridge. All right! Please stop, please. Who is it? It's me. Come on, Frank, it's freezing. - I'm coming. - Nice pants. Thanks I told you before, no dogs. - Come on! He'll freeze his nads off. Look, I've got the hangover from hell, all right? Besides, I just tidied up. - OK, Mutt. Won't be long. Tidied up? - Still no luck then? - No. I've looked everywhere. Tell you what, Goose, if I didn't have bad luck, I'd have no luck at all. Come on then. Let's see what you've got. - It's mint. - It's plate. You can pick these up anywhere. - Yeah? You all right, pal? - I can't fix her. - Yeah? Why is that then? - I don't know. I think maybe, maybe I'm not here. - You hear that, Millsy? Feller ain't here. - Millsy. Mills. Me and Mills go backwards forwards, in Ireland. - Bit early for that, isn't it? Yeah, I've been drinking parrafin. It's used to make chewing gum. You're not from Manchester, are you? - No. Don't think so. - He don't know where he's from. Check your wallet. - I've got, oh. Matches, matches. Matches. Sock. More matches. Must be a heavy smoker. Poker chip. - Pez. - And, and that's it. - Is that gold? - How'd you do that, you mad hat? Don't pull, you. You'll break the strap. Come on. This stuff's all right, but I mean this, it's rubbish. - What? How many times have I got to tell you? No one wants a straight mobile anymore. Not unless it's a free gift with one of these. And this? You serious? I'll give you 50 quid, as it's Christmas. - For the lot? - It's a fair price. - It's not. It's not fair. - What are doing? I'm gonna go see what Kermit will give. - Now you listen to me. You stay away from Kermit! You understand? He's a nutter. You can't tell me what to do, Frank. You're not my dad. - All right. I'll give you 70 quid. -100. -80. - I want 100. You haven't really got the hang of this haggling thing, have you? All right. I'll give you 100. But you have got to promise me that you'll stay away from Kermit. All right? Promise? Go on. Get out of here. It's all there, Goose. You're the one who always said to count it. - Yeah. But I didn't mean with me, though, did I? - What are you doing tomorrow? - Why? - Come on over if you want. I can't guarantee the turkey will be cooked. But it will be clean. - I don't know. I've got things to do. Thanks, though. - Mutt! Mutt! Mutt! Mutt! Have you seen my dog, mate? He's white, with a black patch. - No, sorry. - Mutt! Mutt! - Have you lost something? - My bangle. I must have dropped it when I was out earlier. And I was wondering if that's it. - Can you see it? - Lady's lost her bangle. - A snake. Gold. A gold cobra. - Quiver. - Sorry? - A quiver of cobras. A murder of crows. A pomp of Pekingese. - A quiver of cobras? Is that what they're really called? - I think so. - You sounded like you knew. All these things on the tip of my brain. Bangle. Scissors. Invented by Leonardo da Vinci. - Thank you for trying. - The wedding. He gave it to you at a wedding. There's a garden. It's your garden. The boy comes in. He comes in through the window and he takes it. He takes the bangle. - How could you possibly know? - I don't know. - Mutt! Mutt! Mutt! - What are you doing? - That's an odd question. - You're going to work? - Yeah. - Today? There's someone I have to see before the holidays. - Henry! - I'll only be an hour or two. - Fine. I'll go on my own then. - Don't be like that. I have responsibilities. What about your responsibility to me? To Milly? - OK. If I'm running late I'll text. Meet you there. OK? - Mutt! Mutt? Ah, have you seen my dog? - No, sorry mate. - All right there lad? - I'm Anthony. An- tone- ee. Anthony. I am Anthony. I'm Anthony, Anthony. Mutt! Aglet. What? The hard bit on the end of your lace. It's called an aglet. And this bit. It's called the glabella. Between your eyebrows. Someone, somewhere, came up with a word for everything. Owl's got three eyelids. Each one's got a name. It's not just names. I know that Mel Blanc's tombstone says, "That's all, folks!" Coke would be green if they didn't color it brown. And hippopotomonstro sesquipedaliophobia is the fear of long words. Lost something? - Maybe. My dog. - Mutt. - Yeah. You seen him? - No. You were shouting Mutt. I had a dog when I was your age. - Yeah? - Or maybe I never had a dog. There's a lot I'm not quite too sure about these days. Like this, look. You see, I don't really feel like an Anthony. You don't know what you're called? - No. Other stuff seems to have gotten in the way. - The aglet stuff? - Yeah. And then I saw you. - Oh yeah. - And it seemed like a pattern. Because you stole the bangle. She lost the bangle. You stole the bangle. You lost a dog. It's a pattern. A pattern! - What do you want? Mrs. Thornhill, I'm Henry Penville, Richard's probation officer. - There's no Richard here. No. - Can I help you dear? - It's your grandson, Richard. He missed his appointment with me this morning. - Richard? My grandson. Oh, you mean Goose. No one calls him Richard. No. He's not here. This is serious, Mrs. Thornhill. The terms of Richard's... the terms of Goose's supervision order clearly state he must not miss any of his appointments. This really is very serious, Mrs. Thornhill. And then he goes, she lost her bangle and you stole it. What do you reckon? Copper? - Nah. Manchester's finest have got better things to do than hang out with kids of Christmas Eve. They'll get themselves arrested. So this bloke, he have a name? - Yeah. Anthony. Though he said it wasn't. So then how'd you know it was? He had a name badge on that said "I'm Anthony." - Oh no. - What? - I know him. I bumped into that joker last night. You know, he did have a dog collar. - You're winding me up. - No, no. He had a dog collar around his wrist. He did! - You're serious? Yeah. - You think he took Mutt. I don't know. But I remember someone saying that there was these kids who used to nick dogs. And then when the owners put up reward posters, they'd give them back and claim the money. - Come on then. We've got to go see. What's with all this we business? It might be a , Frank. All the more reason for leaving well alone. - Dad would have come. Oh, you are a manipulative little git, you know that? I was just making Goose a sandwich for his lunch. Would you like one? - No, thank you. Mrs. Thornhill, do you know when Goose is going to be... umm. - Tea? - You've already asked. No thanks. Do you have any idea where Goose might be? He went out with Mutt this morning. - Right. So you said. He may have had an appointment with his probation officer. - That's, that's me. Remember? He's usually back for his lunch. I was just doing him a sandwich. Would you like to stay? - Thanks. I can't, I'm afraid. Not today. Not a good day. It's not, is it? You're not very well, are you Mrs. Thornhill? - No. I don't think I am. Do you remember if anybody has been to see you since the accident? Anyone like me? Anyone like you? No. I think I'd remember someone like you. - Don't worry. It must be hard for you, looking after someone like Goose. - He is a bit of a handful. But, in time all things grow towards the sun. My mother always used to say that. - Yeah. Frank. You leave this to me, all right? Hey! How's it going with the monkey angels, mate? Yes. Angel with a monkey's head, yes. I don't know. Right. Told ya. You do something with his dog? - I don't think so. - So what's down on your wrist? You nick dogs then, do you? - Why would I do that? - For the reward. - There's a reward? - No. - Then why would I take your dog? Then how'd you know about this bangle? - I saw him take it. - No, you never. - Yes I did. - How do you mean? An Indian woman, I touched her hand. You have a torch. Bangle's on the chair. You take the bangle. - Wait. Rewind. What do you mean, you saw it? - I just did. - Oh, come on Frank. - Come here, Goose. - All right. Show us then. Give him your hand. See if he knows what you lost. Lost. Everybody's lost something. This is a marvelous story. I remember reading this as a boy. It was bought during the war of the. Well, yes. Um, now, the thing is, Raven Publishing, they weren't around for very long. And the artist that they commissioned to illustrate their Wilde series... the illustrations are marvelous, aren't they? The artist was Walter Crane. But sadly, Raven went bankrupt almost immediately afterwards. Really? Yes, yes. So, how much is it worth? Well, I think you'll be very surprised to discover just what a first edition of "The Happy Prince" by Oscar Wilde will go for at an auction today. I haven't given it much though. Well, in this condition, I'd estimate it at roundabout, somewhere in the region of 40,000 pounds. - How much? -40,000. Thank you for bringing it in. 40,000 pounds. The Happy Prince, Oscar Wilde, 1888, 40,000 pounds. - Bloody hell. Bloody hell! Where is it mate? I've looked everywhere. - It's just a wind up, Frank. Everyone knows you lost that book. - Please. Please. "High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince. He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold. For eyes he had two bright sapphires. He was very much admired indeed. He is as beautiful as a weathercock, remarked one of the Town Councillors." He's as beautiful as a weathercock, yes. - Australia! Bloody Australia! What'd you expect? You're taking my daughter to the other side of the world forever. - Please Frank. I can't do this anymore. Not anymore. Not since... What are you saying? It's all over? You're just like all the others. "High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince. It is not to Egypt that I am going, said the swallow. I am going to the House of Death. Death is the brother of Sleep, is it not? Bring me the two most precious things in the city, said God to his angels. And the angel..." Goodnight, Dr. Clarence. "High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince." - Dr. Clarence. - He can't get many patients. - He got himself struck off. - How'd you meet him? When he retired, he said if someone had a heart attack in the street and he went to help, he could get himself sued if he was still a doctor. He got himself struck off and no one could touch him. They don't come much more stubborn than Dr. Clarence. Hi. What have you got to be so happy about? I was just wondering, you didn't happen to accidentally pick up a book of mine, did you, from the pub a while ago? Happy Prince? - Oscar Wilde? Would have thought nuts was more your sort of thing, Frank. - Sentimental value, you know. - And it's worth 40,000 pounds. - Yeah. Thanks. - I suppose you'd better come in. - Don't worry. I'm sure Professor X will find it. - Please. He's joking, isn't he? Put them there. Mate! So. Oscar Wilde. Yes. I remember I thought it looked a little unusual at the time. The Walter Crane illustrations, were they? - Yeah. Well, that would be valuable. - You got it? - What makes you think I have? What? He touched Frank's hand. He said you picked it up in a pub. - Were you there? No. He saw it in his head. - Oh. - Yeah, I know. You haven't heard of anything like it before, have you? - Well. - It doesn't feel right. He's completely forgotten who he is and everything. Except for the stuff about owls and aglets. - Aglets? - Aglets. The hard bit on the end of your lace. - Interesting. Really not that interesting. - Oy. I'd really like to know what's happening to me. - Sorry. I'm not a doctor. Not anymore. - Oh. - But, well. Well, occasionally dreams and reality can get a bit muddled. - You think I'm crazy. I don't feel crazy. Inside. - I'm not saying you are. It can happen to patients who've been in a coma as well. It's called hypnos. From the Greek. Hypnos was Morpheus' father, son of Nyx. Night. - So I've been in a coma? - It's possible. As I say... Yeah. And as I say, none of this Greek mythology is getting me get Mutt back. - Mutt. Mutt's his dog. I though I had something to do with lost things. Bangles, books, dogs. You see, everyone I've met has lost something. Except for you. I just can't do this anymore. Somewhere along the way, we started to break apart. I tried, we both know it. Please believe that I wish we could... You'll always have my heart. It's still there. It's under the floorboards. My book's under the floorboards? - I'm not sure I... - Leave it. If that's what you think is best. - Here. - From my wife. She said she left... all this time. And I thought she'd gone without a word. I was so angry, so stubborn. Too stubborn to look for her. Too stubborn to tell her how much I loved her. To tell her she was everything to me. Frank. There is a kind of system. It's in the hall, by the fern. - Thanks. - Who are you? - I wish I knew. - So I give back the bangle. Then what? You find my Mutt. You think so? -40 grand. 40 beautiful grand. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy a BMW. 7 Series? How much are they? 25 if you're lucky. Sweet. Five grand will get me out of debt and get me some new togs. And that'll still leave me... Ten grand. Ten grand for a rainy day. That will buy a big umbrella. Yeah. A really big umbrella. Perfect. What's that supposed to mean? It means you know your mind. So, I'm going to drive round to her place, dressed to the nines. No, no, I don't want to know what dressed to the nines means or where it comes from. Take her for a posh curry, tell her I'm out of trouble, out of debt. I'm finished with all the dodgy stuff. And if she doesn't like that... She can shove it. She can shove it. A man with a plan. Sorry, mate. What is your problem? Don't look at me with your spooky eyes. You're not exactly a man with a plan yourself, are you? Don't know who you are. Falling asleep in the street and touching people's hands and going all mystic on them. You're weird, you know that? So just shut it, all right? - I didn't say anything. - No. Well, she's my wife, not yours. You didn't marry her, did you? - Don't know, can't remember. - Trust me. You didn't. I'd have noticed. - What are you going to do? I'm going to show her the book, prove I'm not a loser. She doesn't think you're a loser. - What do you know? She thinks you're a good father, and so on. - Watch this. - What's gonna happen? - He's gonna ring the doorbell. - Frank. What a nice surprise. - Do you know what this is? This is a first edition of "The Happy Prince" by Oscar Wilde. Illustrated by Walter Crane. And it's worth 40,000 pounds. And you know what I'm going to do with it? I'm going to give it to you. - What? - It's for Australia. So you can start a new life for yourselves. Whatever you want. - Frank, are you all right? - Yeah. I feel fine, actually. -40,000. Are you sure? This isn't one of your... - It's rare. It's really rare. - You used to read it to me. - Yeah. All that time we were scratching around for money, it was right under our nose. And you're just giving it to us to go to Australia? - Happy Christmas. I'm gonna miss you, both of you. - Dad! - Come on. Come inside. Let's talk about this. - Just, just give me a minute. Here's 150 quid. It's all I've got. The bangle. I sold it, to Noel. Now don't let him rip you off, OK? He only gave me 40 quid for it. -40 quid? But you gave me 100. Yeah well, someone's gotta look out for you, haven't they? Thanks. - Prepare for slime on a stick. Here's hoping we've got enough. Otherwise you're going to have to dazzle him with some fact about ducks and trousers. I don't know any facts about ducks and trousers. - Oh. - Hang on. Donald Duck's dad is called Quackmore Duck. Nothing about trousers. - Ding dong. I'll be right with you. What do you want? - I want to buy that bangle back. The one Frank sold you. I don't know anyone called Frank. - No? - No. And you ought to leave. - I did say buy. I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe I'll just get the cops then. Tell them where you got that carriage clock from. - Oh. How dare you. I have receipts for everything. - No that you don't. Because I snagged it out of a house on Ashford Road. - All right. Get out. Go on, get out now. - Or that pocket watch. Or that tankard. DISPATCHER (ON Emergency. Which service please? - Police. - All right. All right. I sold it. - You're lying. - Whatever. Of course, I might be able to remember who I sold it to if the price was right. - How much? - Probably all of it. - All of it? - I think so. - Here. - Good lad. - Come on then, tell us. Well now, I sold it to a woman with some orange flowers. - That's it. For 150 quid, that's all I get? - Well, you wanted to know. I know who she is. - How do you know who she is? What about this piece of crap? This piece of crap has been very helpful. Thank you very much. - How did you do that? - I don't know. Must have learnt it somewhere. - Like the fascinating facts? - I suppose so. Come on. Anyway, you say you know who this woman is? - Yeah, I just saw her. - You saw her? - Yeah. I just saw her. She was getting on the bus. She had the flowers. - What? - Number 47. - It's Christmas. She could be going anywhere. You don't go just anywhere with a bunch of flowers. - At Christmas you do. - Not with flowers. We'll see. - Yeah. And maybe we won't. This bus goes everywhere. Well, haven't you ever wanted to visit everywhere? - Can I ask you a question? - That is a question. What's it like to see... to see lost things? - It's like being in a dream. It's not your dream. It's someone else's dream. You're not supposed to be there. It's like you're an intruder. - It don't sound too nice. - No. Can I ask you a question? - Huh. - Why are you called Goose? Well, back when I was a kid, I ran away from home. And when they found me, they said it was because I was cold. After that, my dad called me Goose. He said I tried to fly off for the winter. - Hmmm. - I never did like being cold. - Me neither. - And who is Frank? - He's my uncle. Well, sort of my uncle. - Your sort of uncle? Him and my dad, they were friends. From school in London. And when they grew up, they both became... firemen. They both became firemen. - But. - Something happened. Something bad. Frank don't really like to talk about it. Flowers. My mom and dad are here. Once upon a time there was a man called Thomas Edison. He was afraid of the dark. And there was a man called Walt Disney. He was afraid of mice. Thomas was afraid of the dark, and he invented the lightbulb. But Walt was afraid of mice. And he invented the most famous mouse in all the world. - What do you mean? I mean that sometimes you have to go towards the things that make you want to run away. Dad would have run towards anything. Come on then. - It's the same day. The same day that mom and dad got killed. We can't just go and ask her for the bangle. She'll think we're nuts. - Wait here. - Why? - Milly? Milly! Where are you, naughty little... Milly! Please, please, do something! Help her! - Sir, step off the ice. We'll take it from here. - Daddy! It's all right, puppet. It's all right. The nice man's come to help you, all right? Sir, please. - All right. Daddy! Daddy, don't go. Sweetheart, what's your name? - Milly. - Milly. That's a pretty name. How old are you? Six. Six. You're a big girl, aren't you? I've got a little girl. She's called Jemma. Stay there, look at me. I'm coming for you. Don't worry. Look at me. You're going to reach out to me. It's all right. It's going to be fine. - Milly. - What are you? Is this some sort of sick joke? - The bangle. It wasn't Noel's to sell. - Bangle? How do you know? Who are you people? Have you been following me? - Yeah. - Why? Why have you been following me? What do you want? - It was my dad. My dad who should have come to save Milly. He could've saved her. He couldn't saved anyone. - What the hell... I knew it was you as soon as I saw the grave. I knew it was you, because he's bringing everything back together, bringing everything together so we can make it right. He is. I hid my dad's car keys. And if I didn't, he would have gone some other way, or something else would have happened. But him and mom wouldn't have died. I didn't mean for them to die. - It's all right. It wasn't your fault, sweetheart. - It was. - Accidents happen. They do. I forgot to lock the gate. I was usually so careful. But I forgot to lock the gate. - The bangle. I stole it. And I need to give it back so I can get my dog back. Please, can I have it? I've got money. - She doesn't want your money. She bought it for Milly. She kept begging me that she wanted a bangle for Christmas. Her friend had one. And... and when I saw it in the window, I just went in and bought it. I knew she'd love it. How stupid is that? It would be nice to believe that though. That there was someone who could make things right again. But I don't really imagine that he'd look quite like you. I know I'm a crazy mad woman. Here. - I will give it to her. I promise. It's good that there's someone who thinks there could be a little magic around Christmas. Stop! Hello. I don't know what sort of sob story this little delinquent has been telling you, but I guarantee you 100% whatever it is, it isn't true. - Mr. Penville. - Henry, do you know... - How do you know Mr. Penville? This, this is who I was supposed to be seeing this morning. But surprise, surprise, he didn't show up. - I lost Mutt. I had to get him back. - Is that the best you can do? What's that? Give it to me. Henry, don't talk to me like a child. Now maybe you do know... - Goose. I'm sure you do know Goose, but have you ever actually listened to what he has to say? Helen, Helen, I speak with him on a weekly basis. - That's not what I asked. I'm sure you do speak with him. But have you ever actually listened to him? I'm not going to have this conversation in front of an offender, OK? Now give me that. You're coming with me, you little bastard. - Henry, Henry! He's just a child, a child whose parents died. - Helen, really? Really? I deal with these people all the time. - These people? Henry, have you always been like this, so full of bile? Or is this just... - Don't! - Don't what? Don't mention our daughter? Don't mention Milly? Milly. - I haven't got time for this. - Ow! I've never known it to snow here on Christmas. I have. You have? - Yes. And I think I know where all this ends. - Where it all ends? - Yeah. Charles? Is that Charles? Coming? Ah, it's Henry. Yes. I'm sorry to inform you... I appreciate that it's Christmas Eve. Listen, I've had my... yeah, I'm... - Yes. Please. I'd like that. I'd like that very much. Nan! Is Mutt home? - Richard. Your probation officer called. Let's have a word. Come on. All right, Richard, where were you this morning? - Empty your pockets. He's a good boy, really. - Don't worry, Mrs. Thornhill. We all want what's best for Richard. Goose. He's called Goose. - For Goose. - Yes. The kettle's just boiled. I'll make us a cup of tea. - That'd be nice. There's a lady from social services coming in a bit. With a doctor. - Is someone sick? The doctor will just need to have a little chat with you, that's all. - With me? I need you to empty your pockets! - I hate doctors. Empty them before I do it for you! - Will you excuse me a moment? You all right? - Yes, fine. Come on, lad, empty your pockets. That's a lot of money. Where'd you get this from? - A friend gave it me. - Carry on. - That's it. It is. Oh. - Do I have to do it myself? - All right! All right. Hey! And a friend give you this too, as well? It's... it's to get... you won't understand. - Try us. - OK. Yeah. I did steal it. But I want to give it back. 10 for originality. You should try that on the magistrate. - Excuse me. Anyone for Battenberg? - Richard! Come on! - Ho ho ho. - This one. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Deja- something. - You? You got it? The boy who stole it is bringing it back. - You were right, though. I've remembered. I didn't drop it. I left it on my chair. Come, come in. - There were lights. - How did you know? - I put them in for Diwali. They looked so good I kept them in for Christmas. - This is where it ends. - I'm sorry. I really am. - I can see you are. Thank you. Shiva, the cobra. People think he is the god of destruction, but he isn't. Shiva just knows that sometimes you have to destroy to begin again, to make the world a better place. But I don't want to begin again. Not without my mom and dad. And the world's not a better place with me in it. It's worse. Because if it wasn't for me, they'd still be alive. Now give me back my dog. I gave it back. Not tell me where Mutt is. It's what you said. - Is it? You're just saying that because you can. Because there is no magic. Because you're a nutter. And I'm going into care. - You're right. Dogs run away and get knocked over. - You're right. Moms and dads die. Children die. And then, then it's just us. And we're all alone. And the lost things stay lost. But maybe, if you do the right thing, someone somewhere gives you a second chance. Give me your hand. - It's just a trick. - Give me your hand. - A stupid trick. I saw you. You can do tricks. - Goose, trust me. Trust yourself. You see, I've remembered my name. - I don't understand. - You will. Many years from now, in the shadows far below the city, amongst the forgotten and the lost, lived a man. He was a conjurer and a clown. Cars honk in the key of F. You know that? A thief and a villain. But when the people of the town stopped to watch his show, he never let them see beneath the mask what life had taken from him bit by bit, piece by piece, everything. - Your first night out? - Lost my job today. Mom threw me out. Said I was a waste of space. And some nights he'd sit and think back to where he'd come from. Before every room had four gray walls and bars. When he had a different life, when he had a different name. The name his father gave him when he was a child. The name his father gave him because he didn't like the cold. His real name. - Goose! Goosey, goosey gander! Goose! Goosey, goosey, gander! Goose. Goosey, goosey, gander. Goose. Goosey, goosey, gander. - Give me your jacket. - Are you sure? - Anthony. - Richie. Richard.
