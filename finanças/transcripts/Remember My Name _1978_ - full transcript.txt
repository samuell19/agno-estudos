How'd it go today? I said how'd it go today. Nothing happened. what did you see today and what are people talking about? Well, Arlene, today I saw faces. Yet I saw violence on those faces. Today, people are talking about themselves. It's that time of year when a family likes to snuggle together before a cozy fire and anticipate the holidays. When a man likes to light up a good cigar or open a beer before the next game. The woman window shops for just the right scarf to go under that winter coat that's been in mothballs all year. I saw young lovers arguing, then making up. And I saw a traffic officer warning, instead of ticketing. It's that time of year when one needs to escape within himself and forget the problems of the past and plan for the future. You know, Arlene, I think that may be the reason no one is talking about the Budapest earthquake... They don't understand it Gee, but it's hard to love someone When that someone don't love you I'm so disgusted Heartbroken too I got the downhearted blues Once I was crazy about a man He mistreated me all the time Next man I get got to promise to be mine, all mine Lord he mistreated me He drove me from his door Dirty dog Yes, he mistreated me Oh, he drove me from his door Ah but the good book says, you got to reap just what you sow Guess who I saw tonight?

Rita didn't tell me for three days, I almost fired her too, but you're through as of right now. - I didn't steal any money - I didn't say stole it. You're just short and I won't discuss it. - Mr. Nudd, I want to speak to you alone - No. Rita, get back to work. Close the door Rita, will ya? I don't want to hear any stories, Emily. I get all the stories I need from my mother. You people are lucky I have a soft spot in my own family. I did not take any money and I did not make any mistakes. Argue with the adding machine too, that's it. It wasn't my fault. I don't have to hear any of this. I warned you right in the beginning about all everything. Mr. Nudd, you're going to have your money back in the cash register tomorrow night. - That's not the point. - I promise. The point is that I'm innocent and you're saying I'm guilty. Because of circumstantial evidence. And because you're a bigot. - Bigot my ass. I hired you in the first place, lady - Did your mother ever tell you how she did it? - Please, put that down. - Did she ever tell you how she did it? - Oh, it was very nasty. - Listen you don't know what I've been through. You don't know what it's like to have a mother who killed your own father. - Get out of here right now. - Get your hands off me! And listen you're going to get your god damn money back here whether you like it or not! Tomorrow night it's going to be right there! I don't give a shit whether you fire me or not. Prick! Stay through tomorrow. But not at the register, in back with Harry. Thank you, Mr. Nudd. 86 bucks in Nudd's office tomorrow morning, Rita. Hey, Rita, what's happening? I'm gonna kill that bitch!

Could I make a phone call? Meanwhile the grim task of searching for bodies continues. Primarily in the fifth and eighth districts of the city. The areas of densest population and tallest buildings.

Neil, I'm having her put in prison! I want you to know everything! Mrs. Curry, I need you over here a minute. Now what? I want ten of these? And this is the first one? - Right, the second - Which one of these goes first? Excuse-me... officer. Bottom line, it goes like this: I cant press charges against this woman unless I have a chance to talk to her by myself. Could you, could you arrange that? Because that would be the best thing. It just would... Wait over there by that table. Hi. Ok, let's keep this short and sweet, Emily. You cannot go around scaring the shit out of us, you understand that? I can't have that, so just get that straight. Ok? Nobody's getting hurt. I only hurt people by accident, remember? Hey, Spidermonkey. Look at your hair. It's grey. Yeah. And your face. You've really been through it, huh? Well, I guess you've been through it too, haven't you? But you look pretty good. Yeah, you look good. I didn't recognize you with dark hair. But you look healthy and alive, it's great. You look healthy and alive too. Ok. Spidermonkey, I wrote this speech. - It's to you, do you want to hear it? - Well, let me tell you, I'm not really into speeches. I've got my wife waiting outside and I'd like to take her home, so... not really. Please? Ok, look, you sit over here and I'll sit over here, and we'll kind of observe the amenities of this institution. Go ahead, what is it? Ok. I didn't cry when you disappeared. Hold it!

Please. - No. No. Oh I get it, you don't want to hold a convict bitch, huh? - Drugged and raped and dirty... - Hey, what do you want from me? You cant tear out my soul because I've already done that myself. Ok? Ok. Hold me. Hold me. Hold me. Listen. I didn't cry when you disappeared. I was very worried about you. But I figured that you had to do your own time. And I understood that. Do you really want to know what kept me alive during those 4,380 days? Ghosts. And one in particular. Yours. You were with me all the time. And when I looked at people, pretty soon came a time when I could only see the landscape behind. But when I looked for you, you were there. with your face and your eyes. and your hands. And you came to me. and you talked me in that deep sexy voice of yours. And you did wonderful things with me. Things we used to be shy about. You love me, Neil. I'm the most important thing in your life, remember you told me that. Remember? Just one more thing, Neil. I want you to know. You're the very first person that's held me in 12 years. I saved it for you. Hold me. Ok, we've finished now. Listen. I have enough money to keep us going till you get started again.

Good. - Why cant you just trust me? - I've trusted you all along! - I know but have I ever let you down? - Neil, this woman is dangerous and you're protecting her. That policeman said she was a murderer, why are you protecting her? - She's not a murderer. There was any murder involved. - Then why did she go to prison? It was an accident. The girl went to prison because the whole thing looked like murder. Well, I want to know why it looked like murder. You want to know a hell of a lot, don't you?

That dog can talk. Had me a dog that can talk for years. When you feel something... like that. You don't push yourself. Maybe optional for some, but it ain't optional to me. I can't stand that stuff. Some people... I got a visit around here that carried 3000 at that time. I don't want to go. That's the main thing. How's it going, it's a beautiful evening isn't it? Well, you know how it goes. Nobody knows. If you had any sense, you'd do it. God, I do know. I got to say this. You and I... really... Really fucked each others lives up.

Hi. How'd you like the stuff I got you? I love it. I got you a work lamp too. Hey, Emily... Tonight's my night off. Gotta work. What are you doin' here? - What? - I said, what are you doin' here? What the fuck does it look like I'm doin' here? She owes me a hundred and thirty dollars. And you can put this fucking lamp up yourself! That's over six hundred dollars so far. Hope she can pay for it. Why, it looks wonderful on you. Yes, I'll take it. And I'll take the sweater with it, and I'll wear it. Fine. Oh, your husband is just going to adore it. And I'd like to take this one. Ok? Now, how much does that all come to? Well, let's see, with this last one it's, uh, six hundred and ninety-two dollars plus tax. Will that be cash or charge? - Oh, you take credit cards? - Yes. Thank you, Mrs. Curry. Would you like us to box this one too? No, that one never fit right. - Why are you changing all your locks? - It's none of your business. Yeah, well, but, if you want to keep someone out of your house, all you have to do is change the combinations on your locks. Listen, I want a whole bunch of new locks in this house. And if you cant do it, I'll get someone else to do it. Hey, I can do it. Let me go get some shit out of my truck. Jeez. The bitches I work for every day. One indiscriminate turning of the restless planet. A planet perhaps that has become too tolerant of man's inhumanity, man's disregard, man's selfish and destructive attitude toward himself and nature. When one thinks of one million innocent victims who died randomly in time, one cant help but reflect on his own searches, his own struggles, his own randomness. One million dead, and certainly more when the final count is tallied. But there will always be more deaths, and it becomes us, the survivors, who must accept the responsibility of the future. Who must move on with the strength and courage and goodwill of the fallen, to live the better life. To live out our potential as soulful human beings. I think we can do it. Take these keys. I want you to lock up my place, Pike. Hey, who's that guy upstairs? Hey Emily! Yes, you can take every advantage of a fellow man that's down You can take somebody's heartstrings, yes and drag it on the ground You can high hat other people just because you're having luck Even double cross your best friend and then try to pass the buck Ah, but there's one thing that is certain, makes no difference where you go Just before your final curtain, you got to reap just what you sow You got to reap just what you sow Yes, you got to reap just what you sow The love I have for you Makes my burdens light The love I have for you Makes my blue days bright Asleep or awake dear Your face I see The sunshine of your smile Is a guide for me The love I have for you Is within my heart The love I have for you Is a thing set apart If you search this universe My dear if you do You'll never find a love like The love I have for you
