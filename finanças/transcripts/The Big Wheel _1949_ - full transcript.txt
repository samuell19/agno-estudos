(orchestral music) (bright orchestral music) (pleasant orchestral music) (percussive orchestral music) (thrilling orchestral music) (car whirring) (man laughing) - Oh, Billy, you're driving too fast. - Mom, don't worry. - Slow down. (thrilling music) (tires squealing) (Billy laughing) (soft orchestral music) - The way I figure it, another thousand dollars and she'll be ready for Indianapolis. - I wouldn't give you another buck and a half. - But, Reno, this is the fastest iron in the business. - How many years have you been taking this pile of junk to the race, Red, six, seven? - Eight. - And you never even qualified. - Yeah, but we broke a steering knuckle last year. - [Reno] And the year before? - Hey, Red. - Huh? - You think this is enough clearance? - Well, I'd give it a couple thousand more. - Thanks. - Tell you what I'll do, Red, I'll buy the garage. - What do you want with a garage? You already got the racetrack and the two best cars. - But the cars aren't mine. They belong to my daughter. - Yeah, I know. So the other owners can't score for the association that you're winnings go to your own purse. - Hey, Reno. (Happy laughing) Did you see me get fouled up yesterday? (Happy laughing) - Yeah, that's tough luck, Happy. - Man, man, I was way out on the road when this little old engine soured out. (Happy laughing) Hey, Red, take a look at one of those plugs. (Happy chuckling) - Well, it looks like your mixture is too lean. - Yeah, that's what I figured. - I'll make you a deal, Reno. - Yeah. - Another thousand now and I'll take care of your cars for a year. - Not a chance. - Okay. Then you better find yourself another mechanic for Number One. - Hey, wait a minute. You don't want to throw good money away. - I'll take care of Lagel's car instead. - Hey, you can't do that to me. I got a mortgage on this place. - You know what you can do with it, don't you? (tires squealing) (upbeat music) - Out of the way, Mack. Hi. - Yeah? - Which one of you guys is Red Stanley? - Right there. - Over there? - [Red] Uh-huh? - Can you use a first-rate mechanic around here? - Like who? - Like me. - Oh, you're good, are you? - Well, I hate to brag, but I'm about the best there is. - Maybe you better hire this kid to take my place, Reno. - Maybe I better let you have that thousand dollars. - And now you're talking. Sorry about the job, kid. I need another mechanic like I need a hole in my gas tank. (wistful orchestral music) - How do you like that? A picture of my father. Must've been taken a long time ago. - Hey. What's your name? - Coy, Billy Coy. - Cannonball Coy's kid. - Yeah, that's right. That's my father. - I was with him at Indianapolis. - I know, that's why I came down here to see you. - Well, maybe you know I was sitting next to him when it happened. - Yeah, that was back in the days when they used to carry a mechanic, huh? - Uh-huh. We were right on the north turn. Less than a lap to go. - I know. Well, he sure was a great driver though, wasn't he? - Uh-huh. - I hope someday I can be just half as good. - You'd have to be good, kid. - Oh, I know that. - What happened to her? I mean, where is she? - What happened to who? - Mary. I mean, your mother. - Oh, she's here. She's with me. - Are you in town? - Yeah, we got here this morning. - Oh. Hey, I can find you some kind of a job, kid. - Well, that's great of you, Red. - I haven't seen her for 17 years. (whimsical music) I'll bet she's still a fine-looking woman. - Oh yeah, she's fine. - Uh-huh. Well, how's she feeling? - Good. Say listen, Red, when can I start to work? - Oh, anytime now. Right away, get yourself some overalls. Hey, kid, take that back to your mother. - Oh, would you like to see her sometime? - Huh? Yeah. I sure would, now that you mention it. - Well, why don't you come over tonight? - Yeah, why don't I? - I don't know. Why don't you? (Reno laughing) - And what I said to you goes. - All right, Romeo. I'll send you a check in the morning. (Reno laughing) (hammers banging) - Say, Mack, where can I find a pair of... You're a girl, aren't you? - Yeah, and take it easy on the curves. - Well look, all I want to do is find out where I can get a pair of overalls. - Well, there's a locker over by the washroom. You might find some there. - Well, I wouldn't have... If I had known you were a girl, I wouldn't have... You know. (Billy laughing) - Ha, ha, ha. Why don't you stop laughing yourself out and help me put this wheel on? - What wheel? - What do you think this is, tin? - Oh, oh. Sure. Take it easy around the curves. (Billy chuckling) (Red whistling) - Hey, Billy, lock this door when you leave. - Yeah, I'll do that old thing, Red. - See you tonight. - Goodnight, baby. (Happy laughing) Goodnight, Bill. (soft orchestral music) - Hey, knot-head, what are you doing to my car? - Nothing, I- - Well, get out of it and stay out. - My, it's nice to see you again. Come on in. You haven't changed a bit. I'll take your hat. I said hat. - Oh. I just thought I'd bring... I mean, you used to like peppermints. - Oh, oh, Arthur. - Chocolate-covered. - You remembered. Have one? - Huh? Oh. - Don't be so frightened, Arthur. I'm not a young girl anymore. I'm a worn-out, middle-aged woman. - You still look good to me, Mary. - I'll put your hat away. - Oh yeah, sure. - Sit down. - Thanks. - Have some candy. - Hiya, Mom. I got news for you. I'm a working man. - Oh, Billy, really? - Sure. All I had to do was mention Cannonball's name and Red gave me a job just like that. - Oh, Billy, that's wonderful. - I guess I'm just a lucky guy. Not everybody had a father like him, huh, Mom? - I guess not, dear. - Oh, Mrs. Coy. Mrs. Coy, what is this between you and fellow Red? (whimsical music) - Why, Billy- - Oh, don't give me that surprised routine. You should've seen the look on his kisser when he was talking about you. Oh, what a schmo. Haven't seen her in 17 years. Still a good-looking woman, huh? I'll bet he thought you were the belle of the ball, huh? - Oh, Billy- - May I have the next waltz? (Billy humming) - Billy- - And then, along came Cannonball, bashful shmo, and the rest of these guys had to jump right out of the window because Cannonball was a champion. Still a champion. - Billy, but- - But nothing. Look, he'll be here any minute now. And I'll bet he'll have a box of chocolates in one arm and his hat in the other, and I'll bet he won't know which is which. - Billy, we have company. - Oh, hiya. (Billy humming) (whimsical music) Hiya, Red. - Hi. Don't be formal, just call me Schmo. - Well, I knew you were there all the time. Didn't I, Mom? I knew he was there? - I don't think so, dear. - How do you like that? Can't even trust your own mother. - I think you ought to apologize. - That's all right, Mary. - I insist. You apologize to Schmo. (Billy laughing) - Excuse me, will you, Red? - Sure. - Forgiven? - Right. - Can I have one of your candies? - Uh-huh. - Mm, peppermint. Say, who's this guy, what's this guy, Vic something or other, what's he got to do with driving those Number One cars? - Vic Sullivan? - Yeah. - Well, he drives 'em. - Is he any good? - High point man in the midgets this year. - Way till I get a hold of one of those little jobs. I'll drive his ears off. Say, you don't know a guy with a hot iron that needs a good chauffeur, do you? - Did you ever do any racing? - Did you ever see that little job of mine? - [Red] Yeah, I noticed you had one. - Well, I beat everything up in Idaho. - Did you ever drive it on a regular racetrack? - Regular racetrack, not exactly. - Well, that's a little different. - How could it be a little different? If I never get the chance- - Suppose we change the subject. - I'm never gonna change the subject, Mom. Maybe you like working in the cannery, but I don't like to see you do it. I don't like to see you wear the same dress for five years. If I wanted to stay poor, I would've stayed in Idaho. I want to make dough, real dough. Not the kind you get from working in a grocery store. - Look, kid. There's only a few chauffeurs making any money in this racket. And there's hundreds of kids already shooting for the eight or 10 jobs that really pay off. - Red, I don't care if there are a thousand. They get in front of me and I'll drive right over 'em. - Billy, put a shirt on. - Now wait a minute. - At once. - Don't hit me, will you please, Mom? Please, I'm- (towel snapping) Ow. - Don't speak to your mother that way. - Take it easy will you, Red, going around the curves? (Red chuckling) (fanfare music) - Ladies and gentlemen, this is Jack Colin welcoming you to Carrell Speedway and the mighty hot rods of America here this evening. And you're going to see plenty of grand activity. We might mention at the present time the cars are preparing to go into their time trials. Each car is given three laps in order to obtain its best time. - Well, Red, you made this into a real racing buggy, huh? - Uh-huh. Now look. If you turn over, scrunch down and pull your head in. - Don't worry about me, but thanks for the advice. Oh, driving one of these hot rods is kids' stuff. I'll win myself a couple or three races and wait and see one of those guys will be asking me to drive one of those big cars. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Okay, Coy, on the track. - All right, let's go. - [Jack] Billy Coy. The road has cleared out for Billy Coy and he's coming out onto the track right now. You can see him. Billy Coy moving onto the speedway. Yes, sirree, for three laps to qualify now for the fast speed race. This round is part of the final. With the green flag. (car thrumming) (thrilling music) Here comes, Billy, now. And he raises his hand- (car thrumming) (car booming) (car revving) (car whirring) (tires squealing) (thrilling music) (car thrumming) (car whirring) (tires squealing) (car revving) And he's moving forward down the red line. There he is, ladies and gentlemen. (car whirring) (tires squealing) (thrilling music) (soft orchestral music) That's all for Billy Coy, ladies and gentlemen. Being moved into the pits now. And they'll make last-minute adjustments on that car prior to the fast speed race that will be this evening. - Nice going, kid. - Pretty good, huh, Red? - You better go a little higher on that north turn. - I'll think about it. Check the plugs, Red. (soft orchestral music) - Big wheel. - He's just like his old man. - Hiya. - Hiya. - Hi, Billy. - One dog, please. - One dog? - Hey, you're really flying out there. - What do you want on an empty track? - What do you want out there, hurdles? - $1.80. - I'll bet I know what you feel about the track being empty. - She's a sharpy. - [Happy] Oh, sharp as scissors and twice as snippy. (Happy laughing) - Is he nuts? - [Happy] Sure, I'm a race driver, ain't I? - That's very funny. - You mean that you can drive faster when there are cars out there. - Your attention, ladies and gentlemen. - That's right. - Your attention please. - Here. - Oh, oh, thanks. - Qualifying for the fast speed race this evening for six laps, Number 31, Peters McGonagal. Car Number 23 driven by Billy Coy. Car Number 48- - Give me a gander, I'm gonna drive right over 'em. (racer laughing) (announcer shouting) (cars revving) (tires squealing) (cars crashing) (tires squealing) (cars crashing) - [Announcer] Your attention, ladies and gentlemen. The following cars failed to finish. Number 23, Billy Coy. Number 62, Johnny- - I'm sorry you're thrown out, Billy. - It's just tough luck. - Of course it was. What happened? - What's the difference? I lost, didn't I? - Yeah. Well, I just wanted you to know I was sorry you didn't win. - Thanks, buddy. - That's all right. - If you want to know, I took the turn too low. - Oh. - Wait until next time. I'll run those guys right off the track. - Sure you will. - I'll have that iron of mine running just like an Offy if I... Hey, you gonna be busy Saturday night? - Huh-uh. - Will you meet me in front of Red's at eight o'clock? - Uh-huh. - It's a date? - It's a date. Oh, eight o'clock? - Eight o'clock. - Okay. - Um. I'd like to see Mr. Stanley. - Who? - Arthur Stanley. - He don't work here. - Why, he's the owner of the pla... - Oh, you mean the boss. Hey, Red. - Hello, Mary. - Could I speak to you a moment, Arthur? - Sure, come in, come in. Come in, Mary. Well, this is a surprise. - I was just passing, Arthur. - Sit down. Sure, anytime. - I wanted to speak to you about Billy. You helped him rebuild his hot rod into a racing car, didn't you? - Yes, Mary, but- - And in his very first race, he had an accident. He could've been killed. - But look, Mary- - You're encouraging him, aren't you? - If he's gonna race anyway, I don't want him to be killed because some dumb mechanic forgets to fasten a bolt. - What is there about racing that you can't resist? Why do you want to risk your lives? Time after time after time. You or Billy or anybody else. - Well, I guess it's for the same reason that men hunt gold and drill for oil wells. It's like Billy says. It's a chance to hit the jackpot. Look at those cups up there. And the big one is filled with hundred dollar bills. Now if you can win the 500 in Indianapolis, you can get rich. Whew. (Red chuckling) - Reno, why should I drive for 30% of the purse when every other chauffeur on the track is getting 40? - And you make more money than any of them. - Well, it figures. I'm the best driver. - Mm-mm. I gave you the fastest car. (buzzer blaring) Yup? - [Secretary] Mr. Riley, your daughter's here. - Send her in. Hello, baby. - Hi, Dad. Dad, I need some money. I need a lot of money. - Well, well, what's on your mind? You want to buy yourself a hot rod? - No. Are you two through talking? - Don't worry about him. Go ahead and speak up. - Well. I... Dad, I want to buy a dress. - A dress, you? You must be kidding. - No, I'm not. I think it's about time I had one. - Well, baby, if that's what you want, okay. How much is a dress gonna cost? - Well, gee, I'm not exactly- - 20, $30 maybe. You could shop around. There's a lot of sales. You might even get one for 15 or less. - Listen, if my girl's gonna get a dress, she's gonna get a good one. Here's a hundred bucks. - Oh thanks, Dad. Thanks a lot. (sweet music) - [Reno] Wait a minute, Lou. - What's the matter, Dad? - The hair. - Thanks, Dad. - I wish you could be that generous with me. - You'd look nice in a dress. (Minnie humming) - Well I'll be busted. - Surprised, Minnie? - What are you doing with all that paint on your face painted up like an Indian? And what are you doing with that thing on? - I have a date tonight. - A date with a boy? - Sure. How do you like the things I bought? - Two dresses? What are you squandering all your money on dresses for when you got a closet full of clothes? - [Lou] Oh, I haven't got anything at all. - [Minnie] You haven't got anything? Why, you got more pretty things in there than most boys your age. - What's the matter with you, Minnie? A girl can't go out wearing things like that on a first date. - And you can just take this thing back to the burlesque show where you got it. - Will you please unpack my shoes, Minnie? (pleasant music) - My, these sure are pretty, Ms. Lou. That boyfriend of yours sure must be something. - [Lou] He's wonderful. - He'd have to be to make my baby wear things like this. - Zip me up, please. - Is he tall? - Not exactly. - Medium? - Well, no. - Well, what does he look like? - Oh, you'll like him, Minnie. He's kind of a short Gary Cooper. He's really very handsome. He has icy blue eyes and a firm jaw and high, intelligent forehead, and he looks like Gary Cooper, James Mason, and Charles Boyer all rolled into one. - Uh-huh. What does he look like when you unroll him? (door knocking) - How about it, girls? Minnie, where's my daughter? - There she is, Mr. Reno. A combination of Ingrid Crawford and Bergdorf Goodman all rolled into one. - Well, stand up, honey. Let me get a good look at you. (swelling orchestral music) - Oh, Daddy. I can't walk in these things. - Of course you can walk, darling. Sure you can walk. There's nothing to it. I have been wearing these high heel cowboy boots for years. - But I just know I'm going to fall. - You won't fall, darling. Now lookie here, listen to me. There's nothing to it. All you do is just put your weight forward on your toes, see? Lean forward. Bend your knees slightly. And when you feel a pain in the small of your back, then you're walking comfortably. See, nothing to it, look. (Minnie laughing) Come on, hon, let me see it. Come on. That's it. You made it. That's my baby. Now, I've got something special for you. Look at that. - Oh, Daddy. That's for being such a very nice father. - Thank you, baby. - Now help me put it on, because you know what? - What? - I have a great big date tonight. - Well. - Well, if that don't beat all. When she was five years old, she was playing football and driving a racing car. And now she's 19 years old and just learned how to walk. (Reno laughing) (car whirring) (pleasant music) - Buddy? - Hi, Billy. (whimsical music) - What was the matter? - It's a rough sidewalk. - You had a rough trip. Well, you're all dressed up. - Oh, it was just a little thing I had around the house. Would you like to take the car? - Well, I wasn't planning on this. Oh, careful. I mean, I wasn't planning on you being all dolled up or anything. - Well, a girl can't go out in jeans all the time, can she? - No, but with me the way I'm dressed and you... I wasn't planning on going dinner dancing or anything. - Oh, we don't have to. Why don't we take a ride? - A ride? Look, bud, to tell the truth. Remember those two special carburetors that you showed me the other day? - The ones I was working on? - Yeah. Well, I thought that maybe I'd get rid of my two old carbs and put those two specials in tonight and that's what I thought we'd do. - Oh, sure. Sure. - Well of course, we don't have to do it tonight. Or you could show me where they are and I could... - Well sure, I'll show you where they are. - You don't mind? - Not at all. - Oh, well that's swell. Oh. I mean, if I'd had known that you were dressed the way you are, I'd have gotten dressed too. We would've done something what you wanted to do. (thrilling music) (cars revving) - Tighten down the fourth plug. - I'll figure she's geared just right. - Hey, Deacon, I hear you're looking for a chauffeur. - I was looking for one. - Well, it looks like you're running in a little bit of luck, because I won the main at Carrell last week, you know? - Hot rods? - Oh, why don't you shut your mouth? - Why don't you stay in your own league, knot-head? - Sorry, kid, I signed Happy Lee this morning. - Happy Lee? Oh, well he's a swell driver, Deacon. You got a good boy. Thanks anyway. - So long, knot-head. - So long, phony. - [Mechanic] You want a little rich on the outside? - Sure. (Billy sighing) Hiya, kid. - Hi, Hap. Hello, Eddie. I hear you got yourself a ride. (Happy chuckling) - Gonna make little old Four Bits here run like a buck and a quarter. (Happy laughing) - If anybody could do it, you're the guy. - Hey, I know where you can get yourself a ride too. - Yeah, where? - It's a Hoodoo Wagon. - A Hoodoo Wagon, what do you mean? - [Eddie] He means it's a green car. - Oh. Oh. - See, a driver won't touch a green car. - Yeah, I know. - Guy drove one in the big race at Indianapolis. Got his iron out in front for 490 miles and less than a minute to go. You know what he did? Put it through a wall and got himself killed. (Happy laughing) - [Eddie] Haven't you ever heard about green cars before? - Yeah, Eddie, I know all about it. - Oh, this guy was a real big shot back in those days. Maybe you remember him. The name was... What was his name, Ed? - His name was- - Cannonball Coy. - That's it, Cannonball Coy. (Happy chuckling) - If you're interested, he was my father. (doorbell ringing) (romantic music) - Who is it? - It's Schmo again. (Mary laughing) - Oh, Arthur. This is a nice surprise. - Well, I thought I'd come over and listen to the radio, if you don't mind. - Well of course I don't mind. Come on, sit down. I'll turn it on for you. - Thanks. - Any particular station? - Yeah, turn it onto 980. - 980. Nine. There you are. - [Radio Announcer] Good evening, sports fans. Here we are at the world's fastest quarter-mile dirt track. Culver City, home of the Mighty Midgets. - They're broadcasting the auto races. - Oh, Arthur, I don't want to hear them. - Well, you'll want to hear this one, Mary. The boy's driving. - Oh, Arthur. - George phoned me from the track. He thought I'd like to listen to it. - [Announcer] And here they come in the last qualifying heat. It's six laps for the six men to try. On the boards, the track record holder, Reno Riley's Number One Junior with Vic Sullivan at the wheel. And on the outside, it's Billy Coy in that Green Super 73, the Hoodoo Wagon. This is Billy Coy's first time out in the midget. Tonight, he's defying a bit of racing superstitions. - Get away from me with that Hoodoo Wagon. I'll run you into the fence. - You get in my way and I'll drive right over you. (cars whirring) - [Announcer] Here they come now, wheel-to-wheel down to the starting line. (cars thrumming) And they're off. (cars thrumming) (cars whirring) They're really pouring it on. Sullivan and Billy Coy are fighting for the lead as they go into the first turn. Here comes Billy holding the flow as he takes the turn. (cars whirring) (tires squealing) (cars thrumming) (wall crashing) - No! - Ladies and gentlemen, stay back. Please remain seated. Just as soon as we know the condition of the boy, we'll let you know. - Oh, not Billy. Don't let it be Billy. (siren wailing) - [Announcer] The track ambulance is racing across the field. And it's Car Number 73, the Hoodoo Wagon that's crashed out there. It's Billy Coy in the Hoodoo Wagon. - Oh god, not again. - Take it easy. He'll be all right. - The yellow flag is up. That's the caution signal that drivers are slowing down. We're still waiting here tensely. Everybody is tense. - Oh god, not Billy too. - [Announcer] The pit crews are swarming across the track. They're running toward the wrecked car. Well now, there's the driver. He's out of the car and on his feet. He signals the crowd he's okay. (crowd cheering) - Oh, Arthur, he's safe. He's safe? - Sure, he's safe. He's going to have a charmed life, that kid. Take it from me. You just leave it to me. - Hiya, Billy. - That was a dirty trick. - Yeah, yeah. - You see me run that Hoodoo car through the fence? - I sure did. (fists thudding) - Get him, Billy. Slug him. Give him that jab. Keep that right hand up. Bury him. No, no, the left, the left, keep the left up. (fists thudding) That's it, now you got him. Oh, ow. - All right, cut it out, cut it out. Break it up here, you two, break it up. Somebody grab him there. What is it with you two guys? - You try to run me through the rail again and I'll kill you. - What's the matter, can't you take it, knot-head? - Now stop it, you two, or I'll have you both fired. - Crisp, isn't it? (Happy laughing) - Anybody need a doctor? - Yeah, I do. Smart young man here decided to put his hand on a red-hot exhaust pipe. - Boy, and am I burned up. Wow. - How about it, doc? - Hand like this, he'll be able to drive in about a week. - All right, I'll quit for the night, right after the main event. - You'll quit right now. - Oh listen, doc, the car's already qualified. - Driver's disqualified by me, and that's official. - Well, who am I gonna get to drive my car? - Not my worry. - Well, how about me, Deacon? - You? - Sure. - Not on your neck. I got 6,000 bucks tied up in old Four Bits and I'm not gonna let any green kid take her out and put her through a fence. - Oh, he's all right, Deac. He beat me twice in the hot rod. - Three times. (Happy laughing) - Yeah? - Yeah. Oh, give me a chance, will you, Deacon? And let me show you what I can do. - All right. (Happy laughing) (cars revving) - [Announcer] And here comes Billy Coy into the winner's circle. So let's give him a great big hand. (crowd applauding) And here's Dame Dolores Raymond to present a trophy to the winner. - Hello, sweetie. I guess I give this to you. - Well, where's the kiss that goes with it? - Oh, is that part of the deal? - Sure, kiss him. Get your picture in the paper. - Here. (Billy chuckling) - Wow. - Where do I come if I want an encore? - Well, I'm at the Club Argentina. Drop over anytime. - Fine, I'll do it. - Do that again. I want to get a closeup. - I'll pay you to say it. - Okay. (crowd whistling) Oh, I hope you got your money's worth. - I sure did. (both laughing) (fanfare music) (car revving) - [Lou] Billy. Billy. - Hi, Billy. - Howdy, Red. - Well, where have you been all day? - I guess I should've phoned you. I quit this morning. - Oh, you're gonna quit working for a living, huh? - A guy's a sucker to work eight hours a day for mechanic's wages. - Say, you got something there. - I make more winning one race than I do around here all month. - Yeah, but you might not win another in a year. - You haven't even got a car to drive. - That's what you think. You know that new iron that Deacon Jones is building? - Six Bits? - Yeah, well Happy's gonna drive that and I'm gonna take over number 50. - Hey look, do me a favor, will you? Drive the car a few weeks to make sure before you quit your job. - Red, suppose you do me a favor and let me make my own mistakes, huh? - Sure, go ahead and make 'em. You got my permission. - Want a smoke? - No, thanks. - You? - No. (George chuckling) - Whew. - Hi, Billy. - Hey, hi, bud. - I hear you're gonna ride Four Bits. - Yeah, that's right. - Oh, would you like to put this on your helmet? - What is it? Oh, half a dollar, four bits, I get it. That's cute. - Yeah, I thought you might like to have a luck charm to, well, to sort of keep you out of danger. - Thanks. What you got in the box? - New hat. Wanna see it? - Yeah. - I got it today. I just bought it. How do you like it? - That's a hat? Look, I gotta get going. I'll see you later, huh? (orchestral music) (car revving) (cars revving) (crowd cheering) (fanfare music) (cars revving) (crowd cheering) (fanfare music) (cars revving) Thank you, honey.

Tonight, we have a special guest with us. If you want to see somebody drive a car the way I do and he gets paid for it, go out to the speedway tomorrow and watch those midget cars. And here's the daredevil that you read about on the sports pages, the fella that drives them, Billy Coy. (audience applauding) Hiya, Speedy. What are you gonna do in the race tomorrow? - Well, I'm gonna do my best. And if I have to, why, I'll drive right over 'em. - Oh, that's wonderful. That's a tip for all you race fans. Say, Carlos, have you got that can of buckshot ready? - [Carlos] Si, Senorita. - Well, let's shake it. (percussive music) - Well, if it isn't Barney Oldfield. How's about me buying you a wee drink, Barney? The best. McGregor's Heather Dew. You don't even have to drink it. You just take the cork out and inhale out. - Oh, let me buy you folks a drink. Waiter. What will you have? - Champagne with bubbles in it. - What? - And put a shot of gin in it to make it bounce. - Yes. (dance music) - A couple of more laps and I'll have it right under control. - Take it easy, Billy, you're not driving a hot rod tonight. (Billy laughing) (dance music) (dreamy music) (tires squealing) ♪ I'm in the crowd, yet I'm all alone ♪ ♪ I'm all alone with you ♪ - [Mary] Is that you, Billy? - Mommy, you waited up for me. Give me a kiss. - Oh, Billy. - Give me a kiss, honey. - You've had too many kisses already. - I don't feel well either. - Oh, Billy, you're drunk. - Mrs. Coy, I only had a couple. - There's something I've got to tell you. - Can it wait till tomorrow, honey? - It's waited too long already. (doorbell ringing) - Oh, let it wait. - Who can that be at this hour? Who can that be? - I don't know, I got friends. I've got millions of friends. Santa Claus. - Well, we finally caught up with you. You're under arrest. - Blue Santa Claus. - Under arrest, what for? - He went through a 30 mile zone doing 85 miles an hour. What do you think you are, a racing driver? - Oh, well, could be. - Come along, son. We're gonna give you a nice, long Christmas present. - Where's your red suit, Santa? Oh, Mommy, wait a minute. Wait a minute, Mommy. Where are they taking me? (Happy laughing) - Where's that balloon brain? That's all I want to know. - He had a date with Dolores last night. Maybe he figures she'll give him the trophy without racing for it. - Well, in another 10 minutes, he won't be able to race. - Don't think I wanted to bail you out. - Okay. - I did it for your mother. - All right, you told me that before. - What you did last night gives a bad name for the whole sport. - All right. - If you want to drive fast, save it for the speedway. - So you wiped my bail. Do I have to listen to you lecture all night? - And another thing. I don't think you should drive tonight. You're in no shape for it. - Oh, what do you mean? I'm as steady as a rock. - Oh. - Hey. (car revving) - Hey, Billy. - Hi, Hap. - Where you been? - In jail, Deacon, in jail. Come on, let's get this loony bean out on the track. I'll see you at the finish line, Red. Oh come on, come on. Let's go, Deacon, let's get it on the way. Come on, mechanical brain, you want me to win, I'll be in the race. Let's go. (cars revving) (dramatic music) - [Announcer] Here come the Mighty Midgets, ladies and gentlemen, into the west turn now. This is the main event. The big race of the night. It'll be for 40 laps. On the pole in the first line is Fred Nichols. On the outside of the first line is Dorothy Whitehead. Moving to the second row on the pole, it's- (Happy laughing) - Hey, Billy. (Happy laughing) Good luck, kid. - Same to you, Happy. - [Announcer] Here, Car Number 75, we have Happy Lee. So we're getting ready for a start now. And as soon as the green flag comes down, these drivers will be on their way for 40 laps in the main event. He's waving them over. Here they come, speeding at the final- (cars revving) - Come on, Billy. - Come on, Hap. - Use those corners. - Come on, Hap. (cars revving) - [Announcer] A team out here tonight of Billy Coy and Happy Lee. Happy in that Number 75 and using all his quick wit for good luck. Happy Lee now breaks over there as he goes in between cars coming in on the west turn again. And Billy Coy is starting to move now too. Billy back in fifth place now, but Happy Lee is starting to move now as he is progressing rapidly and is in second position. (cars revving) - Come on, Billy, get all of them. Get in front of the red one too. (cars revving) - Hey. Look at Happy's wheel. The left rear. It's wobbling. - He's gonna lose it. - Hey, look at his wheel. - Whose wheel? - Number 75. - [Announcer] His rear wheel. And he might lose that wheel, is Happy Lee. And he knows nothing about it whatsoever. - Tell him to stop. (cars revving) (crowd murmuring) - Your wheel! - The wheel, the wheel. - Out. (cars revving) - [Announcer] No, Happy Lee is still unaware of just exactly what's happening and- - Your wheel. - Get away from him, Billy. Don't get on top of him, Billy. - [Announcer] The flag will go down. Here it is, the yellow flag down. And then each driver holds their positions. Each driver raise their hand. What's the matter with Billy Coy? What is he trying to do out there? His friend is in trouble and Coy is moving. Coy is disregarding the yellow flag, ladies and gentlemen. (cars revving) (car whooshing) (cars crashing) (explosion booming) (dramatic music) - Help! Somebody help me! Billy or somebody help me! My legs! I can't- - Let go. Happy. - Billy! Somebody help me! - Billy, you'll get burned. - Happy. Let me go. Happy. Happy. (dramatic music) (somber music) (Happy laughing) - [Happy] Hiya, Billy. - Hello, Hap. Too bad about Happy Lee. - Yeah. - I tried to pull him out. - Sure. - He was my best friend. - Yeah, I know. - Red, you know that. Happy was my best friend. Why doesn't somebody say something? All right, come on. Somebody say something. - You wanna hear it, do you? Okay, I'll give it to you straight from the gearbox. A lot of us here make our living driving race cars. Most of us try to stay alive when we get out on that track. It's a tough enough racket without asking for trouble. So then a punk comes along who says he's gonna drive right over us. The only reason we don't smack him down right away is because we figure he don't mean it. We figure he's just flapping his big mouth. But you did mean it, didn't you, knot-head? A guy got killed because you tried to beat the yellow flag. You drive right over him, didn't you? - It was an accident, Vic. - Not an accident. Not when you ask for it. When you ask for it, it's murder. - My own father got killed in an accident that way. Red, you know that. My own father got killed, didn't he? - That's the difference between you and your old man. When you got drunk last night, another driver got killed. When Cannonball got drunk, he only killed himself. - What are you trying to hand me? - About you being drunk last night, that's no secret. You were loaded. - I was not. What's this about my father? - Cannonball? He was a lush, everybody knows that. - That's a stinking lie. - Why don't you stop kidding yourself? Your old man was a souse and a chaser. Ask anybody. Ask Red. He finally had one dame and one bottle too many and he got his neck broken. - That's a stinking lie. (fists thudding) (lockers banging) (fists thudding) - Come on, break it up. - No, let him off. (fists thudding) That's enough. - Oh, let me alone, will you? Mom. Mom! - [Mary] What is it, Billy? Billy, what is it? - Mom, what kind of a man was my father? - What has- - Never mind about that. What kind of a man was my father? Where was my father the night before his last race? - I don't know. He didn't come home. - Was he drunk? - Oh, he was in no condition to drive. Red begged him not to- - Red rode with him. - He has to protect him. - What happened, Mom? - Well, I was watching them from the grandstand. Towards the last, I began to hope that they'd make it. That was the worst part of it, hoping again, because as soon as I did, he went straight into the wall. When I got to him, he was dead. (somber music) - Then he was drunk. - Oh. He was always irresponsible. - And he chased after women too? - I suppose so. - Oh, Mom, how could he do that to you? I always thought he was such a great guy. I always wanted to be just like him. - Oh don't, Billy. - Don't cry, Mom. Don't cry. Somehow, I'll... (Mary sobbing) Don't cry. - Go ahead and take one of these. - Thanks, Red. - Oh, what are you doing here? - Well, Red, I came back to ask you if I could have my old job back. - What for? - Well, I'd like to drive Number Six, Red. I'd like to take her out right now and get used to her, you know? I'll train for Indianapolis just like a fighter would train for a fight. Red, I want to know that motor, you know, just like a book. I want to see what she'll do in the turns and- - I'm sorry, kid. - You mean you can't use me, Red? - I can't afford you. - Well, you don't have to pay me anything. Pay me what you like. - No dice. - Thanks anyway. - Hey, I've just been looking for you. - Yeah? - Red's rebuilding Number 50. - So what? - Well, it'll take him two or three weeks. So I'd go out and get myself another ride if I were you. - Does that mean I'm all washed up with you? - Do you know what you cost me yesterday? 6,000 bucks. - So what? You risk your dough, I risk my neck. It's 60-40. - Well, you don't need to risk your neck anymore. Not on my account. How about that estimate, Red? (tools clattering) - Kinda gave me the checkered flag around here. - Yeah. - They think I tried to hit him on purpose? - Uh-huh. - Well, do they think I liked putting the wheel through the wall? - Look, I got work to do. Go tell your troubles to somebody else, will you? Murderer. - Is that you, Billy? Bill. Bill. Bill. (somber orchestral music) You're home early. I thought I'd come up and see if you had any socks that need mending. Here's a pair that could do with a little attention. Anything you want to talk about? I'll take these downstairs. - Mom? - Yes, dear? Yes? - Nobody wants me anymore. - Oh, Billy. Oh. I wouldn't say that, dear. - I asked every owner over at the track. They were all after me last month. Now nobody wants me. - Why don't you give it up, dear? Everybody has to stop racing sooner or later. Maybe this is the time for you to quit. - I can't quit, Mom. I can't quit while I'm a failure. - Well, a man can fail at one thing and be a success at something else. - I can't. Driving is what I do best. If I fail now, it means I'll fail at everything I do all my life. - Billy, did you ever stop to really think how I must feel when you're out at the racetrack? Every time your father drove, I had to sit in the grandstand and pray that he'd still be alive when the race was over. Every lap he drove, I died a little. If he drove a hundred laps, I died a hundred times. Then Indianapolis. And now I'm having to go through the whole thing all over again. Every time you're on the racetrack, I don't draw a deep breath till you're home again. Every time the telephone rings, it seems to me I can't bear it. - I'm sorry you feel that way, Mom. - Oh give it up, Billy. Give it up before it's too late. - I can't, Mom. I'm sorry, but I can't. But you said something that started me thinking. You said a guy could fail at one thing and make good at another. Well, a guy could fail at one place and make good someplace else. - Yes, dear, that's true. - Well, then I don't have to stay around here. Well, I can go back east where the big cars are and the big dough. - Oh. - Oh, Mom, I'll send for you as soon as everything is all right. - Don't worry about me, Son. Just take care of yourself. (orchestral music) - Billy. - Hi, Lou. - I'm terribly sorry about Happy. You must feel just awful. - Thanks for saying that. Nobody else did. - I heard Deacon say you weren't gonna drive Four Bits anymore. You want me to talk to my father? - Never mind. I'm through driving around here. I'm getting out. - Out of racing? - Out of California. I'm going back east. - Is it because of her? I saw you go into that nightclub last week. - Well, if you would've waited 10 minutes you would've seen me come right out again. - Oh. - It's just I wanted someone to tell my troubles to. - Look, Billy, if you need someone to talk to... - I can always talk to you, can't I, Lou? - You know you can. - I'm gonna level with you. You know that cute little hat you wore the other day? - Oh, the silly thing with the feathers? - No, no, it was a swell-looking hat and a swell girl was wearing it too. But right now, I haven't got time for any other kind of gear except this. - Then I won't be seeing you anymore? (romantic music) - Are you gonna be in Indianapolis on Memorial Day? - Uh-huh. - I'll be there too. - Then I'll see you there, won't I? - You got a date, Lou. (fanfare music) (cars revving) (fanfare music) - What do you hear from the kid? - Oh, you know how boys are. He doesn't write much. But he does send me a money order every week with love scrawled across it. (Red chuckling) - Well, he's doing good now, all right. Won three straight main events. - I wish he'd never win a race, then perhaps he'd quit. - Oh now, Mary. - Oh, I'm upset, Arthur. I had a bad dream last night. He's driving at Salem tomorrow. I saw him driving straight at a concrete wall. He smashed right into it, head-on. Then I heard a cry, like a little child crying. - That was no hunch, Mary. Those were your fears you were dreaming. - Oh, I hate racing. I hate everything about it. - Oh no, no, you don't. You don't hate everything about it. You don't hate me, do you? - No, I don't hate you, Red. (romantic music) - Begging your pardon, Mary, but I love you. I'll take care of you. I'll take good care of you. - Take care of Billy, will you, Red? Please take care of him. (car crashing) (ominous music) - Well listen, thanks a lot. Bye. (doorbell buzzing) - Come in. - Hiya, Mommy. - Billy. Oh, darling. - Doll. How are you? - Oh. How are you? - Fine. - How's your leg? - Oh, it's as good as new. - You got my letter? - Yeah, about you marrying Red? - Red. Oh, he's such a fine man. - Hello, kid. - Hi, Red. - Hey look, I hope it's all right with you, me getting married to your mother. - Yeah, sure, it's all right with me. - Why, what's the matter with you two? I thought you liked each other. - Yeah, we like each other. - Now look, kid. There's one thing I want you to know. The reason why I wouldn't let you drive Six is because you were too inexperienced. - Yeah, sure. - Well, I didn't want you to get your neck broken. - Uh-huh. - But I never thought you had anything to do with Happy getting killed. - You didn't? - No. You weren't over-driving the yellow flag. You were just trying to catch up with him to show him he was losing his wheel. - That's the way it was, Red. - We all know that now. - Honest? - Sure. - You know, I didn't write you and Mom much after you got married, did I? - No, you didn't. - Didn't get to congratulate you, but congratulations now, Red. - Thanks, kid. Thanks a lot. (Mary chuckling) (engines revving) - Yes, ladies and gentlemen, another day of qualifying here at world-famous Indianapolis Motor Speedway. And let me tell you newcomers to the automobile racing game that these time trials I'm viewing in Indianapolis are indeed rough, wild, and certainly dangerous. How many of you know what I'm talking about? You've seen the days previous to this day of qualifications where the cars have wrecked into the retaining wall, and they've turned over and caught on fire- (car revving) When the car is completely out of control. Now again, the time trial situation is at hand, and these cars must travel around a huge and certainly very dangerous two and 1/2 mile oval four times, that's a 10-mile qualification run and all these drivers are- - [Lou] Billy, Billy! - [Announcer] Attempting to break every track record- - Hiya, buddy. - Gee, I'm glad to see you. - All right, all right, break that up, you guys. You heard me. - Say, what are you doing down here in the pits? You know women aren't allowed down here. - Oh, I'm okay with the gang. They won't squeal. - Oh. - I was hoping you'd be here two weeks ago in time to get a ride. - Well, they didn't let me out of the hospital until Wednesday. - Would you like me to introduce you to some of the owners? - Gee, that'd be swell. Say, by the way, whatever happened to Number One? Have you qualified yet? - No, we haven't tried yet. - You haven't qualified yet? - Huh-uh. - Why? - Oh, Vic and Dad are having some kind of an argument. They're over in the garage now. - Well, what are we waiting for? - [Vic] I'm through horsing around, Reno. It's 40% of the purse or I walk. - You've got no place to walk. You've got no car to ride. It's too late now. - Okay, my friend, I'll drive Number Six for Red Stanley. - Can't do that either, he's already got a chauffeur. - Huh-uh. He had a chauffeur. Sunny quit last night. - Why? Because Number Six couldn't make 125 miles an hour and it'll take 125 to qualify. - Well, Sunny didn't know how to handle a front-wheel drive. I do. After all, Number Six has the same power plan as this car. And if I can make it with this one, I can make it with Number Six. (Reno chuckles) So long, Reno. - Hey, wait a minute, Vic. You can't do that. Don't be a dummy now. What are you... - Daddy, you remember Billy Coy, don't you? - Yeah, hello, Billy. - Billy won the 100 mile race in Dayton last month. - He did? - And the 59 feature at Richmond. - No fooling. - He got second in Oswego and a trophy dash at Williams Grove. - What is that, in midgets? - No, sir, big cars. - Well. Ever handle a front-wheel drive, son? - Oh, I handled a front-wheel Offy at Dayton. - Yeah, we might be able to make a deal here. How would you like to drive Number One for me in the 500? - I'd like it just great. (car revving) - Here comes Vic Sullivan out of the north turn into the home stretch straightaway driving the Stanley Special Car Number Six. Will he take the white flag signifying one lap remaining to go? Will he take it, will he take it? He does not take the white flag. - He'll never qualify. - He does take the white flag at all. - Pull him, lads. Pull him off the track. - A chance to make a few last-minute repairs and adjustments. And two more chances to qualify the car for the big race. - Hi, Reno. Too bad about Red. - Well, son, you all ready to blow off those turns this morning? - Sure am. I'll keep that throttle right down to the floorboard all the way. - No brakes, huh? - No brakes. - That's what I like about the way you drive, kid. You got initiative. Now, remember what you used to say out in California. You used to say I'll drive right over 'em. - Did I? - Yeah, I was there the day you drove over Happy Lee. - Forget about it, Reno. - Boy, did you jump that yellow flag. I'll bet you beat it 20 yards. - I didn't beat any yellow flag. I was trying to catch Happy to tell him he was losing his wheel. - Oh, sure. - Don't give me none of that oh sure business. You talk as if I tried to kill the guy. - I didn't say you killed the guy. I said you drove over him, all right? So the boy got killed. This is racing. You gotta take chances. - What kind of chances did you ever take, you phony? - Looks like I took one chance too many when I hired a fresh kid to drive for me. - Looks like you gotta try and find another drive too 'cause I'm through, Reno. - Why, you dirty little grease monkey. - Billy. Billy. Billy. You're not mad at me, are you? - I'm not at you, buddy. - Then why don't you go back and talk to Red Stanley? He's looking for a driver. - What would he be looking for anybody for when he has Vic? - Vic couldn't get her up to qualifying speed, so he quit. - [Announcer] Yes, ladies and gentlemen. We're in the midst of another day of qualifications. And right now, the starter is waving all the drivers off of the track so we can prepare for the next time trial, which will be on the speedway in just a moment. (cars revving) - Well, how was she, Red? - Well, you can see for yourself. One 19 eight. - Oh, I don't know. It doesn't seem to have any soup on the turns. - Well, I reset the plugs. I changed the adjustment on the carburetor. I switched the fuel. - What's that? - What's what? - That doesn't look the same supercharger that Reno had. His was way bigger. - Well, Dad had a special job put on. They said it would compensate for the higher temperature. - Yeah, I thought of that. I tried to get one. - You left Boss? - Sure. - Well come on, let's get started. Get in the car, Vic. - All right, Reno. Don't blow your gasket. I told you I'd drive it and I will. - We got 10 minutes to qualify. Come on, start the motor. - Contact. (car revving) Well, come on. - It won't start. - What do you mean it won't start? Well get under the hood. Check the plug. Come on, do something there. - Move, move, move, move. Come on, get in there. - [Mechanic] How are you gonna start? There's no blower? - What do you mean no blower? I put it on myself. Look, Reno, if you're trying to get cute with me, I'm gonna bust you wide open. - Me get cute with you? You bring back that supercharger or I'll have you fired for life. - He can't bring it back. - What do you mean he can't bring it back? - [Lou] Because he doesn't know where it is. - Do you know where it is? - Sure, it's on Number Six. - Red took it. I'll have him arrested. Get a cop, get- - Red didn't take it. I gave it to him. - You gave it to him, why? - Because there wasn't another one in Indianapolis and I wanted Billy to have a chance. - So you gave him my supercharger. - No, I gave him my supercharger. It's my car, isn't it? - Oh. - [Announcer] Now on the speedway for the third and final trial, the Stanley Special Car Number Six driven by Billy Coy. - That's all. I warned you about having those kind of children, remember? - If I... (hammer banging) (car revving) - [Announcer] Now he's taking things along those angles, waiting for that green flag to be on his way for 10 miles four times around this huge two and 1/2 mile track. Here he comes. He's waiting for that flag to come down, but he did not take the flag. - Come on, kid. (car revving) - Less than three miles out. Listen to her sing. - [Announcer] Hand did not go in there, which signaled the starter that he did not go to start, and therefore he'll roll around once more and instead he'll take the flag as he moves in over there on the south turn. (car revving) (car booming) (car revving) Now, Billy Coy will be heading into that very, very dangerous and far north turn angle- (car screaming) We'll see if he'll take the flag this time. Everybody's standing and watching his hand goes up in the air. That means he's going to take the flag. And once that flag comes down, Coy's hand is still in the air, and now he's pulled his hand down. Here comes the wind down the center and Billy Coy will be racing two and 1/2 miles. (car revving) (car screaming) (car revving) (car screeching) Incidentally, Billy Coy just turned the first lap in 127.40 miles an hour. - Okay, Billy. (car revving) - Here comes Billy Coy completing lap number three. And now, it's the white flag comes down for him, signifying only one lap remaining to go. (crowd chattering) - He's gonna make it. - Keep your fingers crossed. (car revving) - [Announcer] By Billy Coy on his second lap. 126.45 miles per hour, and in lap number three, 115.40 miles per hour. - What? - I don't get it. - He'll never make it now. - What happened, could it be the carburetors? - I don't know what happened. Well, I guess I gotta start all over again. Another year gone. - [Announcer] Oh, what a tough break. Think of it, 127.40 miles per hour on the first lap. On the second lap, 126.45. And then, on that third lap, 115.40. Ladies and gentlemen, I can't understand what could've happened, because in the fourth lap, Billy Coy turned in 126.20. It's a tough break indeed. (helmet clattering) - I'm sorry, Red. - No, I guess old Number Six just hasn't got it. - [Announcer] The time is six o'clock. The qualifying for the big race is finished. - Well, that's that. - [Announcer] Car 92, Al Harmon driving, will be the final 33rd car in the race. He qualified with a speed of 125.46 miles an hour. Vic Sullivan, Car Number One, failed to qualify because of mechanical trouble. - Mechanical nothing. Due to robbery, due to thieves. I'll have you arrested. - Oh, get lost. - And I'd sue you for damages, but you haven't got anything. You won't even have a garage when I get through with you. - I don't know what you're talking about. - I'm talking about my supercharger. You took it. - Lou said it was a spare. - I'm out of the race. - Well, I got news for you, so are we. - [Announcer] A correction on Billy Coy's time, Car Number Six. Coy's official time, ladies and gentlemen, is faster than that of Al Harmon. Because of a blot on the electric timer, the error was made. So Billy Coy qualifies for the big race. - You're brilliant, boy. Wonderful driving, young man. Oh, you made it. You stole my supercharger. - Well, I... Oh. (orchestral music) - [Announcer] How do you do, ladies and gentlemen? This is Jack Colin welcoming every one of you to the 33rd running of the 500-Mile National Championship Automobile Race here at Indianapolis, Indiana. This is an international event. Yes, people from all over the world have been here for days. The hotels are completely sold out. It certainly is a wonderful sight to see all of these people coming from every state of the Union out here to see the greatest automobile race of all time. (marching band music) Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is truly out of this world. Old-time vintage cars now parading down the homestretch and, believe it or not, under their own power. Makes and models of days gone by with driver and companion attired in early 1900 clothes, while down on the pits, all 33 starting cars are being checked over for minor mechanical trouble by the mechanics, the car owners, and the remainder of the pit crews too. Anything in the way of mechanical difficulty, you know, can keep a car from starting the big race. Right now, the cars are going to be shoved under the speedway next to the pit wall and the car owners giving their drivers last-minute instructions. - Well, Red, is there anything else you want to tell me? - Yeah. Now this is a long grind, kid, so don't try to win it in the first hundred miles. Stay in striking distance and be ready to come in. - I got you. I figure I'll come in for gas around 275? - Yeah, that's right. Now take a look at the north turn. You see that crosswind? - Yeah. - Doesn't look like much from here, but at the end of a long race, it's murder. Go in low and stay in the groove. - I hope I got you, Red. - That's all, I guess. Good luck, kid. - Thanks, Red. - Good luck, Bill. - Thanks George. - Good luck, Billy. I sure hope you win. - Right, Lou. - Get your mind on the race, lover boy. - Don't worry about me. - [Announcer] Attention please, ladies and gentlemen. The big moment is about to take place. The big 500-mile Decoration Day race is about to begin. The cars are on the speedway. The Peace Corps directly in front of the first three lead cars. The pace car driven by the president of Indianapolis Speedway Wilbur Shaw. The lead cars on the pole, Duke Naylon. In the center of the first row, Rex Maze. And on the outside is Jack McGrath, the three lead cars. (cars revving) Here they go, moving out of the south turn down the backstretch. And in the sixth row, ladies and gentlemen, the great human interest story of this year's race, the second generation of a famous name, at the wheel of Car Six, the Stanley Special, Billy Coy. (crowd murmuring) And, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to mention the fact that Billy Coy is the son of Cannonball Coy, the great driver of yesterday, who was killed at the north turn of this racetrack. (crowd murmuring) Long-awaited moment, ladies and gentlemen, is almost here. The pace car coming out of the northwest turn down the straightaway with the 33 starters following in their proper order. They're coming down. This is it, ladies and gentlemen. The big 500-mile race is almost underway. They're coming down now to greet that green flag. As soon as the flag goes down, they'll be on their way. And there it goes. The race is on. (cars screaming) For 500 miles. Duke Naylon running in the lead now as they go to the southwest turn. (thrilling music) (cars revving) Aptly is the plateau, ladies and gentlemen. Leading by six car lengths is Duke Naylon. Rex Maze is running in second. And for you California fans, Billy Coy is running in 17th position. (cars revving) (dramatic music) (tires squealing) (car crashing) And start climbing out of the car. How those other cars got away from George I'll never know. It's unbelievable. (dramatic music) (cars revving) Ladies and gentlemen, these cars are moving. Duke Naylon has broken the one lap track record at 128. and 1/2 miles per hour. (cars revving) (dramatic music) (cars revving) - Come on, Billy, come on. (dramatic music) (cars revving) (tires squealing) (car crashing) - [Announcer] And it's over on the northwest turn of the inside wall. He is turned over, ladies and gentlemen. We don't know what kind of shape he's in, if he can get out from underneath that car. We'll have to see. (dramatic music) (cars revving) - Yup, he's okay. - Wonder who that was. - Ninth place. - Oh, and he is. Charlie Van Actor is okay and look. (crowd cheering) - Off the lawn. - Okay, okay. (cars revving) (dramatic music) - That's 200 miles, ladies and gentlemen. It's Holland, Rose, Ellings, Conner, and Billy Coy. - Come on, Billy, come on. - You gave him my supercharger. That's what I can't understand. - Oh, Father, do you have to win all the races all the time? - Yes. - Well, you won't win this one. Come on, Billy. - They're entering the halfway mark, ladies and gentlemen. And still in the lead is Bill Holland. But Billy Coy, Billy Coy the California sharpshooter is really moving up and certainly displaying fine sportsmanship. There goes Bill Holland in Car Number Seven in the lead. (cars revving) And moving by us now in the grandstand corner goes Car Three. (tires screeching) (car crashing) There was a close call. (tires squealing) (car crashing) End over end, but he held onto the wheel and kept that car under control. The yellow flags are out, ladies and gentlemen, signifying all drivers to hold their position. There's a lot happening out here this afternoon. There's another spin. Another spin in the far turn. (tires squealing) (cars crashing) And the other one's turning end over end down on the far turn. The car's on fire, ladies and gentlemen. And the driver, I think, is Saras. He's laying on the track right now. The drivers have their hands in the air. That means hold their position for the ones behind their respective drivers. They are taking Saras off of the track now. The other driver seems to be in very, very bad condition right now. That's Teem Marinaz. The drivers are getting tired. (dramatic music) (cars revving) The green flag is down again. The green flag has gone down again. Holland going to the pits for a spark plug change. It'll be just a matter of moments before that car is back on the track. - Bring him in for gas. - Okay, Red. (cars revving) - [Announcer] Coy received his instructions okay from his pit crew, and will be moving in now for fuel. There goes Billy Coy to pit number six. (tires squealing) - Here you are, Billy. How do you feel, kid? - Okay, Red. Where do we stand? - When you pull out of here, you'll be fourth or fifth. - She's purring like a kitten. If we have any luck, we're gonna take it all. - Yeah, well, now watch out for yourself in that north turn. One mistake there and you lose it all. - Don't worry, don't worry. - All set, Billy. - All right, I'll go. - Oh, ladies and gentlemen. What a sensational pit crew for Car Number Six. They refueled that car in no time at all. Oh, wait a minute. There's something wrong down there. Car Number Six, it won't start. It is not going to drive away. It looks right now there is something wrong with the engine. Probably spark plugs. Oh, what a tough break. There comes plenty of cars by again. Conners and Thornton have gone by. Billy Coy's losing that precious time. - Put that hood down. - That's all right. - All right. That's all right, let's go. Don't touch it. - [Announcer] Oh, ladies and gentlemen, will that car start? Will it go? It is. It is back on the track. There is a real break for good old Red and Car Six is back on the speedway. (cars revving) Billy Coy has moved back onto the speedway again, ladies and gentlemen. And Billy Coy has a lot of mileage to make up right now having been in the pits even for that short time. Now they're all moving around the turn. Bill Holland is still in the lead followed by Tommy Parsons, George Conner, and Billy Coy is back there fighting it out for sixth place. (cars revving) (dramatic music) There's a spin in the north turn. (tires squealing) (car crashing) He's on the track. He gets up, though. He gets up. What a spectacular crack-up that was. (cars revving) (dramatic music) Lots of carbon vapor is being thrown from the exhaust of the various cars right onto the drivers' goggles, and it's pretty tough when they have to take one hand off that wheel and keep wiping the vapor off of their goggles. Billy Coy, the boy from California, is trying desperately to move back into contention for a first place, because Bill Holland riding the Bull Crown is right smack in the lead and leaping at the present time. But he's going to stay in the lead. However, anything can happen at this track because we've accidents all afternoon. There's a starboard spin down there on that far turn- (cars revving) (tires squealing) But they're right on the track. Can the drivers get by them? And they are, but the yellow flag went out and the drivers are fighting out of their car. Bale and Spalding. A very close call indeed. (cars revving) Green flag is out, ladies and gentlemen. The wreck has been cleared from the speedway. But right now on the backstretch, we're watching Billy Coy as he moves into fourth position and he's challenging for the lead. Bill Holland is still in first. Jack McGrath is moving up very fast on Bill Holland. But here comes Billy Coy. Here he comes, very fast on the outside now. Up there flanking Car Number One. And he's on his way now to lap Car Number 36. The car is one lap behind Billy Coy. Billy Coy's in third, McGrath in 2nd. (cars revving) - Come on, McGrath. - Come on, McGrath. - Come on, McGrath. That's what I'm talking about. He's a great driver, ain't he? - That's my son. - You mean you're Jack McGrath's mother? - No, the other one, Billy Coy. - Coy? Come on, you Coy. Come on, you Coy. - Come on, Coy. - [Announcer] This is one of the most sensational races I've ever seen in my life, ladies and gentlemen. There goes Billy Coy. He has moved by the second place of Jack McGrath and he's still in second place all by himself, which means he's lined up- - Signal Billy to pass seven. - Right. - [Announcer] What a sensational driver. Cannonball's boy, as great as his father was. (car revving) - He got it. - What did I tell you? That kid's got what it takes. - I'll take my hat off by the end of this thing, Red. - [Announcer] The sign he got from his pits to pass number seven, and that's Bill Holland. (cars revving) There's a spin. There's a spin down there by Wilkins. Bill Carrison is across the track. (tires squealing) (car crashing) But he looks like he's all right. There is no gasoline on the speedway. And there's no Carrison or Wilkins. (cars revving) Ladies and gentlemen, what a sensational race this boy Billy Coy is running this afternoon. Now he's starting to move up on Bill Holland, the leader, the old-time veteran who still comes in Car Number Seven. And of course, the newcomer to Indianapolis Speedway is Billy Coy. Can Coy take Holland? - Come on, Billy, come on. - Come on, kid, you can do it. Come on. - It's very, very doubtful, but you can't tell. Anything can happen right now. But Coy is showing the old speed of his father. He's moved up now body-to-body with Bill Holland. At first, it's Holland in the lead, and then back to Coy. But Coy is really starting to move up, and he's very, very fast now. And I think he might do it. And he is going to do it. He just passed Bill Holland now has Billy Coy, from the West Coast and sprung into the lead. Bill Holland's in second and Johnny Parsons is in third. - He's done it, Red. We'll take your jacket off. - If he only stays out of trouble. - [Announcer] Now, ladies and gentlemen, the flag is down. The white flag is down. One lap remaining to go now. (dramatic music) (cars revving) (car crashing) Into the far side of the crash wall. And the whole wall is on fire. One of the worst fires I've ever seen here in Indianapolis. And I will let you know who the driver is. I'm sure it'll turn out fine. (dramatic music) - Can you tell who it is? - No, I can't. - It's Duke. (siren wailing) (flames roaring) They've gotta drive through it. - Where's Billy? - [Announcer] Here comes Coy. He's coming into the north turn. And the cars in front of Billy Coy are about 12 laps behind him. They're going at a slower speed, and they get away and they're around the flames. But here comes Coy. Coy goes through. - He's through. - But he got through okay. Look, ladies and gentlemen, that Car Number Six is on fire- - That's Number Six. Look at that, look. Look at the engine, it's on fire. - Let's shut off his engine. - He's on fire. - He's on fire. Jump, Billy. - Jump on out. - [Announcer] Now there's a good chance he'll never even finish it now if that car does blow up. If those flames smack into the the back half of the lead tied to the rear, he's a sure goner. His poor mother is sitting in the stands. We can certainly see how she feels, because she witnessed when her husband Cannonball Coy was killed out here 18 years ago because a fire. - Jump, Billy, jump. - What is he gonna do? He better jump. Why doesn't he get out of that car? He'd better jump, but no. - Oh my god. Billy, come on, jump out. - [Announcer] He says he's gone this far and he's gonna go all the way. Bill Holland passes Billy Coy. - Billy, get out of the car. - Bill Holland's in first position now. And Johnny Parsons- - Jump out of the car, Billy. - Jump out of it. - [Announcer] Bill Holland is the winner, ladies and gentlemen. And Billy Coy is really turning into flames. (cars revving) (dramatic music) - Come on, we gotta get him out of there. (flames roaring) - Get him out of there. - Come on, Bill. - He's burning alive. - [Announcer] It might be too late. It might be. He's trying to get out of that car now quickly. (explosion booming) (crowd cheering) (car revving) - Kid, your arms are burned. Let's find a doctor. - Never mind about my arms. The race went up too. - We rebuild and try again next year. - Yeah, with whose dough? - You came in third. - But those cars had passed me. - All but two were in another lap. - In third? - Yes. That gives us enough to build any car we want. Come on, let's get your arms fixed. - [Announcer] And now, moving into victory lane is Bill Holland, Car Number Seven, the Blue Crown. A runner-up for two years in a row. And this year, 1949, it's Bill Holland's year. - He'll be all right, now, don't worry. - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please. Bill Holland has made one of those wonderful sporting gestures that make automobile racing the sport that it really is. He will not receive the famous Borg-Warner Trophy, the cup that has always been presented to the winner of this race. But he insists that the officials award custody of the Borg-Warner trophy to a driver who did not win the race, but who won the hearts of the whole racing world with his skill, his daring, and his great courage. We present the trophy to Billy Cannonball Coy. (crowd cheering) (triumphant music)
