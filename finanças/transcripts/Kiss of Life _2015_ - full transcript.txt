ÇİÇEK HOSPITAL TWO-WEEK DUTY SCHEDULE NATURAL ANTIBACTERIAL SOAP DAY 15 HANG IN THERE Stuff your ban. I'm having an infarction. You saved my husband's life. You're a world-class physician, Mr. Onur. Please. I was only doing my j... Damn! What's wrong with you? My lower back. It sometimes... My bag. My hospital bag. God, he's back again! Sadık, Metin is coming. Excuse me, it's an emergency. -Metin is coming. -He held out two weeks, though. -Don't admit him. -I'll do what I can, but he will manage to get in. If he asks, I'm at a symposium in Europe. No, say Africa. -Africa. -Sadık. What's going on? Metin is coming. -Who is this Metin? -Ms. Hayat, let me put it like this. A bar has its regulars, right? And a hospital? Well, look no further. What's wrong with him? Let's say he's super finicky. Excuse me. -Your friend is back. -Metin? Yes. I say ditch the coat and melt into the crowd. Now! If God gave us Metin, he gave us patience too. Bravo, Ayça. A truly awesome medical diagnosis. Look what the guy does to me. I'll ask for an appointment again. People will think I'm crazy. So, Metin is back. Here we go. Back to square one. Sadık, Sadık! It's bad. I'm having an infarction. This is Metin, right? Who is that? You can't smoke here. -Sadık, where is Dr. Onur? -In Africa. At a big symposium. Africa? Hey! Toss that cigarette. What is it to you? Sadık, I can't breathe. Where is my wheelchair, Sadık? Where is Metin's wheelchair? -Don't panic. You sound as a bell. -A bell? Why do you say that? You mean an alarm bell? I ring alarm bells? Tell me. Do you mean an alarm bell? Laugh away. All you have is a broken arm. No kidding. -Please, hold that away from me. -We can't find Metin's wheelchair. It's two weeks since I was here and you lose my chair, huh? Don't worry, Metin. I'm on the case. Come here. Have this one. Come on, have it. No, keep it. You're so easygoing, who knows where you've been sitting? What's that? A dog? Go away. Shoo! What's it doing here? Shoo! Go away! Hey, are you scared of dogs? What's that got to do with it? What's a stray dog doing outside a hospital? Send it to an animal clinic if you want. Hey, OK. Keep still, boy. If anything happens, he'll blame you. -Here you go. -Good. What was the combination? Come here. Stop laughing. Why a... Laugh your lungs off at yourself. -Hop in. -I'm right here. -It's safe, right? -Sure. OK, go. You can't smoke and that dog has to go. Get out of there. Get me an ECG done, Sadık. Don't eat that. It's glucose. Sugar is poison. Get off the floor, kid. People walk there in shoes. -Keep calm. -How can I? I have acute coronary syndrome. Plastic cups? Use paper cups! How often have I told you? -You're drinking from petroleum waste. -Who put them? Hasan, where are you? Dr. Onur's in Africa and you go AWOL. It's OK. I'm here. Don't worry. We'll run some tests, then do an exam. Sadık, take Metin to the lab. Excuse me. Use a headset. Phones emit radiation. -And you're a doctor. -They just don't know. I didn't bring your referral. I'll go get it. I'll be back. Don't be long, Sadık. OK, the line's long, but Metin has to jump it. He needs blood tests before seeing Dr. Ayça. -Hey! You're over that crisis fast. -Thankfully. There you go. God works his wonders. Huh, Metin? How do you know my name? You're so famous here everyone knows you. I have some health situations. I can see that. Serious ones. For sure. Back off! You only broke an arm. You smoke cancer sticks outside ER. You harass me when I'm fighting for my life. Metin! Where have you been? Hey, kiddo. I've been to hell and back. They banned me from here, you know? I wonder why? Metin's illness is different to mine. He has to stay away from hospital to get better. Is that right? Aren't you cute? What's your name? -Emrah. Yours? -Hayat. Come here. Wait. You can't touch the boy with those dog-germ hands. -He'll catch something. -I'll touch you. Stop! Sadık! Ms. Hayat, we're ready for you. You should check Ms. Hayat's lungs. She smokes like a chimney. Nurse, I want to forego my turn. But please take this tiresome man away. Tiresome? Don't laugh. Whose side are you on? Don't laugh! Nothing's wrong with you. -Ah! But it must be. -But it isn't. I have Dr. Hasan's report and the test results. What if the tests weren't done properly? -What? Every time? -Dr. Ayça, I was dying. Yes, of health anxiety. You don't understand. I'm not a hypochondriac. I've made my diagnosis. You couldn't hold out two weeks. OK, Doctor. I accept your diagnosis out of respect for medical science. Metin, I have patients waiting. You can go. Don't come back for a month. After that kind of dismissal I'd stay away three weeks anyway. One month. You're free to change doctors. That's not what I meant. I just thought you'd be worried. I mean, what's another five days? Good. You can go. Me? Yes. Dr. Onur's on duty tonight and the guy's in Africa. They're screwing me up with their screw-ups. Çicek Hospital, hello? Hello. I'm calling from the Health Ministry. A relative of mine is on his way to your hospital. Which doctor's on duty, I wonder? Sorry, who's calling from the Health Ministry? Me. The Minister, that is. Metin. Don't call me Metin. What cheek! Come on, Metin. Sorry, but I can't say which doctor is on duty. Dr. Ayça's strict orders. Goodbye. Oh, God. Who is it? Me, Metin. Who else? How did he know? Hi, Metin. How's it going? Good thanks, Çarli. You? Great. Fantastic. Did you finish the drawings for the boat? Well. Pretty much. We promised those French guys. -It's a three million euro deal. -OK. Making him strip at the door again, Metin? He's dirty, Gülsüm. Hello, Gülsüm. Hello, son. Gosh, even at my age I'm less afraid of death than you. Where does that come into it? I'm afraid of dying like an idiot. If I have to die, I should die like a man. Never mind, Gülsüm. I'm used to it. My friend is a maniac. You boys are something else. Out the way. Let me get in. Don't sit there. That's my chair. I had one made for you. -OK, Metin. -For God's sake. Whoa! Don't let it go to your head, but this is your best boat design ever. What do you think? If Dr. Rıza was on duty, he would park his motorbike by the entrance. What's going on? Another duty doctor crisis? If you figured it out, I'd be spared this, Çarli. What can I do? They don't believe me. They know who I am. They won't say who's on duty. Good boy. There you go. The girl's a ditz. She does everything a sick person shouldn't. Let it go. Come here. Let's talk about the boat. Don't pet him. -Look, don't pet him. -Hello. -Hello. -Wait. I'm coming down. Where are you going? God, he's really lost it. I bet he got that place because it's by the hospital. Didn't you hear? I said don't pet the dog. -Metin... -Don't say a word, Yakup. How can you allow it? The animal has every parasite from leptospira to toxoplasma. Really? I had no idea. Thank you. Glad to have informed you. Narkoz? Do you have parasites, boy? Show him your parasites, boy. Come on, show him. Don't mock me. Why are you mocking me? I don't care about you. You'll contaminate my hospital. This isn't your hospital. I know where your hospital is. It's the funny farm. Just wait, I'll get you thrown out of here. It's me who'll get you thrown out. I'll get you sent away in a straitjacket. -Oh, my God. -Ms. Hayat. Metin's a bit... He's best left alone. You're right. They say: "Provoke a madman at your peril". I'm not mad. I'm cautious. She had her hands all over that filthy dog. Get her disinfected before she goes back. OK, I'll take care of it. Everyone should know their place. What... -Metin, can you just calm down? -I'm perfectly calm. -There you go. -Metin. Here. Parasites for you. She flipped me off. Çarli, see that? She flipped me off. She calls me crazy and then smokes cancer sticks. Don't yell. Everybody is watching. OK. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Good night. -Don't touch me. -Let's go. Hey. Who's that girl? No one. We met at the hospital today. Bravo. You progressed to an ordinary degree of anti-sociality. Can you only connect with girls at the hospital? I didn't connect with her. Let's just call it an unpleasant encounter. Do you realize, being so antisocial means you have no friends left, let alone girlfriends? I'm the only one. I'm happy the way I am. Only because you don't realize the way you are. You used to be such a mild, sweet guy. But you became this hooligan. Sure. What's with yelling at a stranger? -I didn't. I alerted her. -Mind your own business! The hospital has doctors and nurses. Leave it to them to alert her. OK, but they didn't see her petting the dog. She'll contaminate my hospital. You're still saying my hospital. It isn't yours, Metin. Don't make me crazy, OK? You can't even get mad and storm out of this place. Look at me. You went out, right? You should put on new shoe covers. -Metin! -What? They're dirty. Good grief! Who is it at this time? Who is it? Open the door. Who are you? Come to the window. Quick. You'll see who I am. What did you do to Narkoz? Where is he? I 've been feeding the dog in the same place for two weeks. And suddenly he's gone. Did you have him poisoned or taken away? -What did you do? -Metin. God forbid. Did you kill a dog? No! Just three days in hospital for a broken arm and she thinks she can bring me to book. Three days? Maybe it's been two weeks. I got an infection. What of it? OK, there's a risk, albeit small, of infection after surgery. But not in my hospital. That's puzzling. My hospital again. -What did you do to Narkoz? -Metin. Did you give him poisoned sujuk? Sujuk? Processed food? I can't touch that stuff, Gülsüm. So, I'm not guilty. Ms. Hayat, what you're doing is against hospital rules. Sadık... See this guy here? This finicky psychopath... He poisoned my dog. He's a dog killer. Hear this, everyone. Know it. The guy's a dog killer. He did it. You did it, I know. He did it. Calm down. Ms. Hayat, calm down. It's OK. Ms. Hayat, calm down. Sit in the chair. -What did you do, Metin? -Nothing. Metin, I don't believe it. I thought better of you. Gülsüm... Look... I... Meto, this is my working day. If it's not about work I won't listen. So don't start. Çarli, talk to the girl. I didn't touch that dog, dammit. The girl fainted in the street. It wasn't my fault. I swear it wasn't. Wait. Hold on. Calm down. What dog? What girl? Who did you knock out, Meto? Hayat, that girl last night. She was petting a dog. It's called Narkoz. It must've gone missing. She stood in the street And yelled: "You poisoned my dog. Dog killer!" Then she fainted. Which made me feel groggy. Talk to the girl. Say you know me. Say I don't do things like that. Am I your guardian, Meto? Go talk to the girl face to face. She wouldn't believe me. Why would she believe me? Why would she believe you? True. You were with me last night. I couldn't do it myself, but I might get you killed it. That's how her mind works. I mean, she's crazy. She imagines things that just aren't true. So she imagines there's a problem when there isn't, right? I say you'd understand best where she's coming from, Meto. I know how to clear my name. Hi, Cengiz. Give me a coil of sujuk. You turned serial, huh? I never expected it of you. -Expected what? -Dog killings. The woman yelled it out. Everyone heard. I didn't kill anyone. And the sujuk is to prove my innocence. Give it here. Wait. -How much is it? -20 liras. Wait. I'll put it there. Good luck. Thanks, Cengiz. Narkoz. Narkoz. Narkoz. Narkoz. Narkoz, here, boy. Oof, Narkoz. Where have you been? I got such an earful thanks to you. Wait, let me get some snaps of you looking good as one in the eye for that witch. Here, boy. Look at me. Yes. Help. Wait. Toss the sujuk. -Toss it to the dog. -Here. Oh, God! Whoa, asshole. So, it's personal. What's going on? Narkoz is chasing someone. Excuse me. Narkoz is back. -Mom, that's Metin. -Metin? I told you, right? I met a crazy guy here. That's him. That's Metin? Poor man. -Metin. -Sadık. That mangy girl's mangy dog bit me. I'm getting afraid of water. Hydrophobia's kicking in. I'll die foaming at the mouth. Help! Haseki, Etfal, Haydarpaşa, Numune, Kartal, Beykoz, Sarıyer, İstinye. All these state hospitals have the rabies vaccine. Get me the vaccine fast. And put me under observation. ASAP, Hasan. Metin. Calm down. I'm calm. I'm a bit calmer. I disinfected the whole area where you say the dog bit you. Thank you. But the intriguing thing is... -There isn't any sign of a bite. -What? What are you talking about? There must be. -The dog just licked you, didn't it? -Really, know-it-all Hasan? So why the fear of water? If you decide you have rabies, a fear of water is normal. OK, Hasan. Go away. I reject your treatment. Call me a cab to Numune Hospital. It's that girl. She messed with my head. How are you doing, Emrah? Good. Are you allowed in the hospital now? It's crazy, but they let me in when I'm not sick. -Do you need anything? -No, thanks. See you then. -Sadık. -Please don't ask me for anything. I'm taking Emrah to get a blood count. I have a lot to do. It's just a simple question. Hayat's room number. And which floor? You know I can't give out confidential patient information. Sadık, I'll put you through last month's checkup again. Come on, Emrah is waiting. Oof, Metin! Room 1251, second floor. Oh, God. Ms. Rüya, can we continue this in my room? Sure, doctor. Let me tell Hayat. You're Metin, aren't you? Hayat's friend. She pointed you out from the window. Friend? -Well, we met here. -Come inside. God... To make my special sauce... Hayat, honey. Your friend is here to visit. You talk. I'll get a coffee downstairs. -Do you want anything? -No, thank you. I don't drink coffee. It reduces calcium levels in the body. It also reduces iron absorption, which isn't good at all. And you should avoid it anyway. In later years it can cause osteoporosis, God forbid. Yes. Sure. Wait a second, Metin. This is important. Season with salt and pepper, add three cloves of garlic. Then two spoons of tomato puree, two of ketchup and blend on high. -Disgusting. -The sauce is ready. The hamburgers, too. So, there you are. -Enjoy. -Well, it is done. If you have to make them, at least don't use ketchup. The preservatives and colorants in it can lead to cancer, God forbid. You don't use it, then. Why are you here? Look at you! The plaster's off. You must be glad. Yes. Thank you. -I suppose you didn't come to say that. -Too right. I came to prove that Narkoz isn't dead. He's also in good shape to chase me. -I have photos if you don't believe me. -No need. I saw you just now. Aren't you a great runner! Good for you. Really? So, instead of apologizing for slinging mud, you laugh, huh? Just to prove to you that Narkoz isn't dead I went to buy sujuk, then I went to find him, he attacked me. I ran away. I risked contracting rabies. And all you do is laugh. I don't believe it. Metin, come back. I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry. Sweetie, why are you packing? I thought we'd leave today after seeing Dr. Onur. That's why, mom. -Honey. -Mom. Mom, I'm fine. Please. Don't do this. Sure you're fine, but we'll leave if the doctors say you can. I'm bored. I'm bored, OK? Bored of being here when there's no point. -You're right. -In that case? In that case, mom? In that case we'll leave if Dr. Onur says you can. We never move on, do we, mom? Enough, mom! Enough, mom! It won't shut! Wait, I'll do it. Where are you going? To get some air. Is that banned, too? Hayat. Wait a second. I'm out of breath. Your timing's superb. So they say. I was looking out the window, saw you here and ran down. OK, now that we forgot Narkoz, I mean your mud-slinging over the dog... -Well, if you want to apologize... -Yes? Find out who's on duty tonight and let's call it quits. -Really? -Yes. You are so damn selfish. Don't you think of nothing but yourself? How can you think of death all the time, psycho? If you die, you die. That's all. We all die someday. Would anyone grieve you? Think that. -The faxes went through, OK? -Sure. -And they have been told. -Yes. OK, great. There. Hello, Meto. I was about to call you, partner. Çarli... If I die, will you grieve for me? For goodness sake. What kind of question is that? So, will you grieve for me or not? You think I wouldn't, Meto? Such a nice friend! But you'll be grieving on your own. Sure. Who wouldn't grieve for someone who died without enjoying this wonderful world? OK, I have my answer. No need for uncalled-for comments. What was your call about? We have some special requests for the boat. I need to explain them face to face. We should meet. Can you come to the marina? Why should I? You come here. We'll get some food. Come on, don't whine. I have food. I made a meat stew. I'm forever running after you like a goddamn assistant. So, just for once get off your ass. What about my stew? Stick it into your tiffin tin. People already know you're unhinged. That means taking a plate and fork, too. Just listen to you! Metin, this job is important. You're screwing up, OK? Come if you're coming. He hung up. What is this? Everyone's yelling at me. I have a small errand to run. I'll be right back. Emrah. How's it going? What's new? I'm good, but you don't seem great. Oh, my God. Why's that? You were arguing with Metin. I saw from the window. I saw the other night, too. Well. You know. Metin's a really good person actually. He's just a bit weird. Weird? Weird falls way short when it comes to describing Metin. You know, he's the only person who treats me like I'm not sick. And I treat him like he isn't sick. That way we get along. In fact, if you got to know Metin you'd be mental about him. Sure. Sure, if you refuse sujuk you'll go hungry, Mr. Narkoz. There's no one around. Not even Hayat. Am I stuck with you? Do I have to feed you? Hopefully you like meat stew. Hmm, delicious. You're lucky. Come here. Come here. We get along fine now, don't we? You're capricious. I don't believe I did this. Whatever, enjoy. I can't believe you dragged me here. You don't realize how serious this job is. If this job fails, your livelihood's on the line. Why? Don't we have any money left? You don't. OK, you spent a fortune on kids with leukemia and that's great. But the gear for the treatment center is waiting in customs because we can't afford to clear it. If the French don't buy this boat, you'll be sending that center no more than a bottle of aspirin. OK, I get it. Then, why did you drag me out here? If you'd come home, I'd have started working by now. Is this so bad, my friend? You left the house, got some air, had a change. I'm happy at home. I'll make those changes and send them tonight. Whenever I look around I see people having a good time. But whenever you look around, you see invasive germs rampant viruses and wildly partying bacteria, right? No. I see a guy with a lousy sense of humor. Goodbye. My idea of fun is your idea of the plague. Where is he? For just a couple of bucks he expects the world in return. -There you go. -Thank you. Any time. But what's to get mad about? I'd have opened the door myself if I could. Come off it. At this time of night. Anger is bad for the heart, you know. So what if it is? Drive slowly. Wear the seatbelt. Wear your seatbelt. Metin. What? Can we have a quick word? Don't worry. I won't bite. Still you have to mock me, huh? It just came out like that. I didn't mean it that way. Come on, please. What's up? What's going on? What's that? Open it and see. This week's duty schedule. I don't believe it. I gave you such a hard time. I'm sorry. I had such a tough day, it's like medicine to me. Thank you. -Really? -Yes. Can I ask you a favor? OK, if it's something I can do. I'd say you can. It's very easy. Will you be at the window tomorrow at 9:00? -Why? -Will you or won't you be there? Sure, that isn't so hard, but... Is that a promise? OK, it's a promise. At the window at 9:00. OK, see you. Wipe it, go on. I'm used to you by now. You'll have a heart attack. The French guys are coming, Metin. They want to discuss a few last details face to face and sign the deal tonight. Don't waste time trying to drag me out. Anyway I sent the changes at dawn. When did you see them? I forwarded them. The guys loved them. They're all excited. If you don't believe me, here, look. A three million euro deal. -Read it yourself. Here, take it. -Don't... -Hey! -What? Look, if you try to sit on my sofa once more I'll torch that sofa in the middle of your office, OK? All right, OK. But my butt didn't touch it. -OK, but... -But what? I already let you in like that because you're rushing. So, don't push it. I'm dying of sweat. If only I'd stripped. Anyway. -What time is the meeting? -At 9:00. OK, I'll come. OK. That's my man. Here, let me give you a hug. -Don't... -But let me congratulate you. -But, Metin. -Go away, go on. OK. I'll pick you up tonight. -I'll come by myself. -No, I'll pick you up. Promising to come by yourself means stopping at ER first. Metin. What's up? Where are you going? Nothing. I'm out for a run. In that gear? Çarli. Çarli. Metin, what's up? Tonight's a no-no. I can't make it tonight. I have a date. You have a date? I promised to Hayat. Hayat? Oh, that girl. Hmm. She's coming to your place? No. I'll be at the window. You'll be at the window? You call being at the window a date? Be at the window tomorrow. Tonight you're mine. I can't. Çarli, I can't. I promised. What are you going to do? Well, have a coffee outside the Emergency Department. OK, Metin. Have your coffee, but don't be late. I can't stall the guys for long. I won't be late. Don't worry. And I may skip the coffee. It'll give me palpitations. I'll get mineral water. If you ask me, go for bleach, buddy. It'll disinfect your insides. Crazy guy. You can't drink bleach! So, what should I drink? Mom. Mom. Bye! Hello? Hello? Hello? Where is the girl? Hello. I'd like a cab. Come down. Come on, quick. OK. Metin, Come on. Hurry. Come. Are you escaping from hospital? No, I'm giving myself time off. Hop in. It's my birthday today. If you don't come, I'll go alone. OK, I'm coming. But I need a favor. Can you close the door? I can't touch it. Let's see what you do where we're going. OK. Well, where are we going? Take us to Tünel. Tünel? Tünel. Here, Metin. Look, we call this a bar. It's a kind of modern dance hall where people socialize. This is new to you. Learn it. Now go get us two beers. I'll be right back. Beer? Yes, beer. Beer. You'll be fine. Gum will help. Look. There. Go on. But I can't chew gum. Hello. Welcome. One beer, the lowest alcohol kind. And a bottle of water. -But not cold. -OK. Hello, Metin. Do you know what time it is? Where are you? Is that music what I hear in the background? Don't ask, Çarli. Save me. Save you? Oh, really? It's you who should be saving me. I'm having stress here stalling our French friends. When will you be here, Metin? I don't know. Wrong answer. What do you mean you don't know? Çarli, Hayat's escaped from hospital. We're at a bar in Taksim. What? OK! So? For God's sake, Metin. Metin is a funny guy. What are you doing at a bar? No idea. I just found myself here. Çarli. I'm hanging up. Oof. What a relief. Some color in my face at last. OK, you'll start saying make-up gives you cancer. Don't waste your breath. I don't care. No. You look beautiful. Really? Metin is coming. Cheers? Cheers. What is this? Low-alcohol? Of course. You know what alcohol does to an infected body? No? So let me explain. Can I have a beer? -But the harm alcohol... -Metin, enough, enough! Enough. Come on. -What, are we going? -No, we're going to dance. But I can't dance. Neither can I. Just sway. It's fine. I can't sway either. Your phone's ringing. Look. Ignore it. I'll call back later. Come on then. Hey! Stop! You'll set us on fire. Put that out. What's going on? Answer the phone, Metin. Hmm? Yes. Yes. I see, Metin. OK. OK, fine. He is coming. But traffic is a big problem in İstanbul, you know. -Yes, for sure. -Yes. More wine? I'd like to try some raki. He would like to taste raki, you know. Do you want raki? Wonderful! Wonderful idea! Hey, Vural. Vural, come here a second. My guests want raki, Vural. Bring a 75 cl bottle. No, make it one liter. And all the frills to go with it. Fruit, music, dancers, you name it, OK? Go on. Go for it. Raki. Wonderful idea! Come on then. Cheers. Cheers. There you go. Yes. Dirty idiot. Is no one out there? Metin, can you hear me? I've made an ass of myself here stalling the guys. You can meet Hayat any night. Please, Metin. The guys are out of here tomorrow. Gone. Look, Metin. Even the Turkish coffee has come. You have to come, Meto. Fast. Or a year's work will go to waste. You hear me? I'm sending the address again, OK? In case you erased it by mistake. Thank you, my friend. Excuse me. Wait. For goodness sake. Sorry. Excuse me. OK, Come on. Let's go. Where? To the hospital? Yes, the hospital. No, just forget the hospital! The night is still young. -We'll go somewhere else. -No way. OK, you stay here. I'll go by myself. Wait. I can't do that either. Come on then. Let's go. Hayat, wait. Can we... Please, ten minutes. Why did you bring me here? Didn't you have a work dinner tonight? How do you know? You shouldn't leave your phone out in public spaces. Keep it in mind. One minute. Metin. Metin's here. Metin is coming. Metin. He's here. Metin's here. Run. The guys are going. Come on, Metin. Hurry. Quick. He is coming. Good evening, gentlemen. I'm so sorry we're late. Today's our wedding anniversary. It's all my fault that we're late. If only you'd said so in advance. As I said, I apologize. But it's my fault, not his. I see. Congratulations to you both. Thank you. What did he say? He congratulates and wants to discuss the details. Thank you. Please, let's talk about the last details. Thanks. -You must be Hayat. -I certainly am. Hello. I'm Çarli. I know. We spoke on the phone just now. Or rather, you spoke and I listened. Welcome. Come. Here you go. You can get out. Sorry, I can't hold it. OK. There you go. -Let's go get coffee. -What about the hospital? You're so into hospitals, Metin. You even rent a house right across from one. You know what? If you were really sick you'd hate hospitals. Can't you go two minutes without an insult? Leave me alone. Here, I'll sneak you in through the medical waste exit. No. Forget the hospital. -We're going for coffee. -Where? Your place. -My place? -Yes. -But -Metin, Come on. -OK, but Hayat... -Run. We'll sweat. Yes. Here we go. Welcome. Whoa. So this is where you plan the craziness you get up to outside. Sorry. Sorry. I'll take them right off. No, you don't have to. Really? Really. You're different. Just put on shoe covers. What's that? You have your home address on there? Sure. Have you heard of a diabetic coma? In a diabetic coma you forget your name, address, everything. Here. Slippers? But we should disinfect our hands. Oh, gosh. I guess I can't sit here. I can't sit here either. Of course! You have a huge plastic-wrapped sofa. How could I miss it? Really, Hayat. It's a safe zone, right, Metin? Believe me, it's the most comfortable, too. You're the first real crazy I've ever met, Metin. The same goes for you. Huh? OK, you go make the coffee and I'll go see what a crazy house is like. The thing is, there's no coffee. I have echinacea tea. I'll make that. Well! He may be psycho, but he reads like crazy. No doctor would have as many books on medicine. "PHASES OF THE HIV VIRUS", METIN ASILKÖK "THE FINE POINTS OF HULL DESIGN", METIN ASILKÖK Plus, he writes. No way. He washes his banknotes. WITH THANKS FOR YOUR HELP AND DONATIONS TO OUR CHARITY FIRST PRIZE, SAILBOAT CATEGORY -Is that a burning smell? -Burning? I opened the window to air the place. Must be from outside. Why would anything burn in here? So, you read a lot, huh? So, you're poking around my house, huh? Your parents? Ha. Yes. You look like your dad. So they say. Do they live around here? They had a boat accident. I'm sorry. Thanks. Is that why you design boats? I don't know. But the boats I design are definitely safer than theirs. Look. I designed it. My biggest dream is to sail around the world in it. What do you think? I don't know a lot about boats, but It looks good. What's its name? I haven't given her one yet. Whoa. So, you dream of sailing the world in a boat you designed. A dream that can never happen. How come? I... I... I'm afraid of death, Hayat. Metin, don't be ridiculous. In the end, death is a part of life. Life is life. Life is life, in other words. -Is that how it translates? -How does it then? That's life. OK. That's life. That's true actually. You fight with a girl for petting a dog and contaminating your hospital. -You run from hospital with her. -Exactly. You fight with a tiresome guy for poisoning your dog, and celebrate your birthday with him. -You go to a bar. -You dance. True. I danced, didn't I? Then you come to his house. You share your dreams. You listen to his story. You introduce your parents. And you do something you'd never do. Metin. I'm sorry. Are you disgusted? Disgus... Disgusted? No. It was beautiful what you did. I mean I really liked it, but you're in my care now. We left the hospital, so if your mom wakes and asks where... Also... Saliva is an antiseptic, you know? It contains 400 good bacteria. OK, some can get into the blood and cause a heart infection, but they're mostly good. What am I talking about? Make yourself comfortable while I clean this up, OK? You can drink what's left. Wait, I'll be back. Hayat? Hayat. Yakup? -How's it going? -Good, thanks. Did Ms. Hayat go in? Yes, just now. -Good. OK, have a good night. -Thanks. How's it going, Narkoz? Narkoz, you know what happened tonight? Hayat and I kissed. What's shameful about that? It was joyous. Bravo! OK, calm down, champion. OK, good night. You crazy animal. Oh, my God. Did I go to sleep like this? -In that case buy me a tea. -OK, I can do that. Dr. Onur. How was Africa? What? Ah, yes. You look nice today. Thank you, Metin. You too. Let me say right off I'm crazy busy today. I can't see you. I'm even late for my rounds. Me too. What did we say? Life isn't about seeing doctors. Hope it's a good day. I have other plans. Leyla. Has Ms. Hayat changed rooms? She was discharged this morning. She was discharged? -Did she leave me a note? -No. I was here when they left. Hey, Metin. How's it going? Not great, Emrah. Hayat's been discharged. When? You didn't know? So, she didn't leave you a note? OK. Carry on playing. I'll drop by again, OK? Goodbye. -Leyla, where's Dr. Onur? -On his rounds. -Which floor? -Third. OK, guys. What do you think? -Didn't you have other plans? -Hayat's been discharged. Have respect for my patient. This is a consultation. You need your thyroid removed. Can we talk about her discharge now? If it's my discharge, I have every right to hear. No, this isn't about you. It's about Hayat. Hayat's the girl I met in this hospital. It may seem like a joke to you, but up until now I haven't been interested in anyone but myself. But now I'd do anything to find out how she is and where she is. OK, she didn't leave a note. But didn't she even say goodbye? What you'll be seeing now is our show boat. But we can make any kind of changes you like. Excuse me. You first. Hello? -Çarli. -Metin? Where are you? What's up? What's wrong? She's gone. Hayat... Hayat's gone, Çarli. She didn't leave a note or anything. She left just like that. OK, Metin. I'm on my way to pick you up. I'm on my way. I'm leaving. -But the meeting? -Screw the meeting. Look, normal people drink when they break up. OK? If you say you're normal, prove it. Drink up. -I am normal. -The hell you're normal. You drove away a gorgeous girl with your insane behavior. It's my fault, huh? My fault? Here you go. Stop, Metin. What are you doing? What are you doing? -Water. -Let me make you a coffee. That's best. Sit down. I've made a real mess. -I don't want coffee. -OK. Calm down. I am calm. I'm calm. Çarli. Last night Hayat came to my place. We kissed. Really! You know, we kissed. Like in the movies. A real one. She kissed me first. She did it by choice. She kissed me first, you see. Coming was her choice, so was kissing. So she wanted it to happen, right? Look. If she comes back I'll mend my ways. I swear I will. I'll do whatever Dr. Ayça says. Forget Dr. Ayça, I'll do whatever Hayat says. Provided she comes back. I'll eat sloppy hamburgers. I will, dammit. OK, Metin. But if she meant to come back she'd never leave unannounced. It's up to you to find her wherever she's gone. How will I find her, Çarli? Ask her doctor for her address. Never heard of patient confidentiality? Giving patient information is forbidden. Especially to me. They'd never do it. But you've been at the hospital longer than most doctors. You can find a way. I can't think of anything. Metin, don't give up just like that. -We'll figure something out. -Yeah, right. How? She's gone. Give me that. Drink slowly, dammit! That's no way to drink the stuff. Stop! You aren't used to it either. OK, the doctors won't help. -No. -Admin are tightlipped, too. OK. Tightlipped, yes! OK, but you spend half your life at that hospital. -True. -Isn't there a single person who'd be able to help you? Yes, Çarli. There is! Who? The only way to solve this is with Emrah. -Yes. -That's my man! -My man! -OK. Metin, I don't believe it. Right now you're hugging me. And I have dirty clothes on. Don't exaggerate. I was drunk. I don't remember. -The girl will come here. -She sure will. That's my man! There you go. Break-break, Emrah. What's "break-break"? What you say on a two-way. Isn't it "copy that, over"? What's the difference? Get to it. Over. Don't worry. Over. 1260 wants help. I'll handle it. Break-break, Ozan. What? Backache? What's with "backache"? What's "break"? Oof! What an ass for ever saying "break"! Get to it fast. Over. What's going on with these kids? -What's up, Metin? -Hello, Gülsüm. -Hello. -I brought you a gift. -What's that? -Antibacterial soap. You're lucky. No need to buy soap again. It'll last you to the grave. What kind of talk is that? I had so much soap I needed a clear out. -OK, let me have it. -It's heavy. I'll put it down. Metin, how's that girl? She's a lot better, Gülsüm. She's out of hospital. Really? So, do you see each other? Hopefully we will. Metin, the girl needs you badly. Find her, won't you? Are you going to flower for me, girls? Are you going to flower for me, my lovelies? Is that plant food? Yes. The neighbors kindly watered them, but they need nutrition, too. Aren't you going to call Metin? No. Why not? Why are you torturing yourself? Mom, please. Let's not go over the same ground yet again. Go back to your plants. Hayat! Hayat! Hayat! Hayat! -Metin? -Hayat! How are you? Hello, Mrs. Reyhan. How are you? Fine. How about you? I'm a changed man, Mrs. Reyhan. Hayat, check this out. Here. You see? Look. I sat on the ground on purpose. Look... -Metin! -I'm relieved! But that's not all. Watch this. And look, the car's white so the dirt shows up. Me, who couldn't touch a cab, look at me. See? How is it? Bravo, Metin. Dr. Ayça would cry if she saw. Dr. Ayça didn't do this, Hayat. You did. But I'm not done yet. Open the door. I'll be up. What now, I wonder? Hello. How did you find me here? Where there's a will there's a way. I knew it. I knew you'd taken Narkoz with you. Narkoz. Behave, boy. Can we drop these assumptions? The old Metin's gone. I came to prove that. Look, watch. Hey, boy. Narkoz, I've missed you. And you? He gave me his paw. See? Good boy. He's missed me, too. I'm petting him with both hands. See? Not just one hand. Yes. There it is! What's that? What's that on the table? Wait. A half-drunk glass of water. What would the old Metin do? Not even touch it. And the new Metin? Just watch. Metin, wait. Don't. Don't drink it, son. Say that to the old tiresome Metin. Metin, don't. Mom, quick. Call an ambulance. Would the old Metin be laughing now? Never. -And the new Metin? He's laughing. -Metin. -Huh? -That wasn't water. Huh? What was it? Plant food. Mom made a chemical mix for the plants. That's what you drank. No, really? Metin? Metin? How's Metin? There's nothing to worry about. We pumped his stomach, but he's fine. His vital signs are normal. He's awake now, if you want to see him. But we're keeping him in overnight. Until tomorrow. Thank you. How's the patient? Are you OK? Yes, thanks. I'm fine. But tell Hasan he's keeping me here for no reason. Metin. Enough, OK. I understand what are you doing. You really do? Yes. But you know what? You should stay here tonight. I thought you understood. OK, this time I'm the worried one. But it's my fault you were poisoned. Please, stay here tonight. OK. I'll stay just for you. But we're going for dinner as soon as I'm out. We'll see how you are. Metin and I may go for dinner on Saturday. Great. Do it. What can I do, mom? I tried but I couldn't. He came and found me. Good for Metin. Life is life. What's that? Just a saying Metin and I have. Never mind. -Where are you taking me? -It's a surprise. -Aah. -Really. Here you go. -Dinner is sloppy hamburgers? -Yes. Remember you wrote down the recipe they were giving on TV? This is the home of that recipe. -Forget it if it's just me eating. -Not a chance. Go ahead. Please, after you. I'm a sloppy hamburger man. -Welcome. Come in. -Thank you. You're so smiley. Here we go. Thank you. Hey, come on. You drank all that plant food, you stayed in hospital and still you're strong as an ox. You want to be defeated by a sloppy hamburger? How is it? Ridiculously tasty. You see? Another hamburger for me. Make it sloppy. How about going to the bar we went to on your birthday? I'm exhausted. Take me home, will you? Sure. What do you want to do tomorrow? Are we meeting tomorrow? Don't you want to? I figured you'd be busy. No, the project's delivered so it's quiet for now. How about a picnic? -A picnic? -Uh-huh. -OK, sure. -Really? If you're tired... They're all white. That's so boring. If I had a boat, I'd paint it red. You couldn't do that. Ah, why not? I could if I wanted. Boats shouldn't be dark-colored. A dark-colored boat would absorb all the sun off the water. Then the cabins would burn up. Well, you could do it, but... Trust me on this. You're talking to an award-winning boat designer. OK, Mr. Award-Winning Boat Designer. What color boat do you plan to tour the world in? White. White? Metin, you are so wild. So you're sure to name the boat something equally wild. Wait. Let me guess. Careful. Careful of what? No, I meant drink slowly. OK. You had me confused. -I'm drinking slowly. -Small sips at a time. Are you counting my sips? No, I'm not, but... Hey, enough! Just watch me down it in one. No, stop! God forbid. -I was scared you'd choke. -Hey, what is this? A ring. Well... I know it's classic, but I couldn't think of an original idea. Except that by panicking I've still managed to botch it. I mean, I... I love you, Hayat. Hayat... I love you more than anything else. Will you marry me? Aren't you going to answer? I can't marry you. I can't, Metin. But why not? Please don't pressure me. Please. So you're saying no? No. I'm not saying no. I'm saying I can't. What do you mean you can't? -Why can't you? Do you have other plans? -Yes. I plan to die. Do you hear? I'm dying. I know. What do you mean you know? Did my mom tell you? No. I knew long before that. You can't have thought a hypochondriac like me wouldn't realize, did you? Your room number got me thinking first. Second floor. 1251. -Why's she there with just a broken arm? -How do I know? Dr. Onur didn't see me, but I saw the worry on his face as he was speaking with a woman. I also know that Dr. Onur isn't an orthopedic specialist. That woman was your mom. I knew then that you had more than a hospital infection. When you picked me up in the cab... If you don't come, I'll go alone. I glanced around to check nobody was looking. Your mom was watching from the window. Your mom wanted me to get in that cab. You were mistaking her for someone else. I put a sleeping pill in mom's tea. She was asleep. Why would your mom allow her sick girl to escape from hospital? Your mom wanted us to have that night together. Though she didn't think you couldn't do better than me. Because you're so beautiful. You're so nice. You're almost perfect. You revived me, Hayat. Say yes. Please say yes. Let's sail around the world together. OK, yes, you're sick. I know, but... So what? You'll get sick, decide to keep going and get better, right? Sickness is a part of life too, right? That's life, isn't it, Hayat? We'll fend off that sickness. Just say yes. Say yes. Please. Just nod. I can't live without you. Please, say yes. Just nod. That's enough. Good morning, sweetie. Good morning. -Wait. The omelet. -Look at you, up and making breakfast for me. -Uh-huh. -Wait. -Let me turn it. Wait. -It's OK. I can do it. I see that. It's my favorite thing. I watched the other day. I know how to do it. -You're making me so nervous. -Wait. Please. The omelet's in your hands, OK? -OK. -Ready? -Yes. -OK. Go for it. -So, we nudge it across the pan. -No. -Then flip it over -No! I guess that didn't work. I know a great breakfast place. Shall we go? What am I going to do with you? -Can you get mad at me? -No. No, I can't. I can't. My omelet... Come on, let's go. Turn off the gas. OK, no burning the place down. Hey, OK. Leave it. Hayat. Hayat. Hayat. Hayat. Don't go. Stay. Please, don't go. In the end, death is a part of life. Life is life. Life is life, in other words. -Is that how it translates? -How does it? That's life. That's life. Do you have parasites, boy? Show him your parasites. Show him your parasites. If I had a boat I'd paint it red. You couldn't do that. My biggest dream is to sail around the world. -What's its name? -I haven't given her one yet.
