Well, technically I am older every time I see. Truth! Truth! In a pure biological level. Well, at a emotional spiritual also, of course. People change constantly, as ... as ... Well I enjoy these conversations, father. Oh yes! Sure! Where do I put my glasses? Are you sure you do not want anything else? Mom, I'm full. Definitely not arrange food in this restaurant. I do not know because you do not mute the dormitory. Why not get yourself an apartment somewhere. Big enough for you e. .. for someone special. You will never know a good girl living in this male dorm. You'll end up like the old Clay Handleman down the street. Never married, and having to keep a roommate like that ... good hairdresser who lives with him. Does a great job with the lighting. I like to live in the dorm. For God's sake let the boy quiet, Anya. He will leave the shell when ready. And then ... The girls will come running as salmon. I am almost certain the salmon swim, Dad. Exactly! In addition, the dormitories are good to male leads. Oh yes! Absolutely! Many links. Tons of ... connections. Day and night, know, sometimes two or three times a night. I told you this a hundred times, Mother It's like I'm with Dean and the other teachers.

Sit down for the love of God. Why do these words Cross only has words of 9 letters? It's Sudoku, dear. Sudoku Yes Su - the - ku. Should know what it means? So, I am virtually certain that 'struck' totally the final exam in philosophy. All we had to do was completely fill a blue book and answer a question. What was the question? "Why?" Curiosity. That was the question. "Why?" Not caught. The answer should be: "Why not?" How is that answered the question? Well, my argument was that the insignificant inherent American political environment, which can be combined with the advent of "reality TV" that forced the masses to look outward instead of inward the "why" is the only question can put them, especially if hope of a human growth ideological, or prevent stagnation which currently is installed, not only in the arts and culture of our country, but also the terrible range, for those less fortunate, especially those come from developing countries, for which the question of "why" will never be important, because their entire lives are almost exclusively focused no question of "how?". Well, I like the competition American Idol. [music competition which is based on the "Idols" in Portugal] And there have. I have a question for you, Mr pointy. Why not offer Abby a little more cocoa? More cocoa would be lovely, thank you. I need a word of nine letters ending in "fore". So then I had to hear all about their school lessons in beauty. Apparently the high-elegant is what's in this half screaming. Duhhhh! Nicole remembered the Kidman at the Oscars last year? That was tragic. For her yes. So ... excited ires see your parents tomorrow? Strangely ... rather see your parents tomorrow. Well .. I am sure they would love it. But both know that will not succeed. Your stupid parents would not allow. Hey! Continue to be my parents! And? They deserve to be called stupid because of the way they treat you. You have no idea. Where are you? On the way to the bathroom. Talk to you tomorrow? Definitely. Good morning, dear. Have you seen my glasses? I saw all of you. Sorry, Mom. The small Olaf is here, you can not walk around like that. I thought you liked when I walked. Beware you, Mr. Gunnunderson. Prefer to be careful with Mrs. Gunnunderson. Sit down and take your breakfast. Good morning. It is so if an adult dress for breakfast. Until what time Abby was yesterday? Until very late. Why do you have invited? I thought you would like to talk to an old friend like her. She is so sweet. Furthermore, you are practically engaged. We are not! We dated! In four years ago! Four years! In high school! We are completely different people now! I mean ... she is a beautician, and and I'm ... You're what? I ... not a beautician. With a hair that not even need to say. Abby asks you to make a cut and hairstyle, she will be happy about it. I do not need that Abby me 'comb' to be happy. Oh my God, this is good! I could eat a million of them. Wait a second. Father! Really! Yet not even 9 hours! If death taught me thing was that they are always 4:20 am somewhere. Jesus! Sven! It's Christmas!

No. It does not matter. Ok Seriously, what is it? What is it? What? I mean, what pants are these? Please! My mother bought me these pants. Ok Let's pretend that it is Stacey, and I am Clinton, of course, and this here, this is ... what NOT to use! What? What?! Why is not happy to see me? I! But ... But what? What are you guys talking about? Nothing. We will accommodate your friend before your balls cool. Pancake balls. - Hello - Hello I'm Nathan. It's so good to know the friends of Olaf.

It sucks! Yes I think I should be glad my still talk to me. Rarely, but still ... Working at Council LGBT school gave me the kids know religious parents fanatics have accepted them with open arms.

Even though he has moved Welcome to the city of Minnesota. So where are you? Wisconsin, does not notice? What is the difference? I pretend not said that.

So wait ... you married in the summer ... but your birthday is not until December, that's nine months apart? My water broke even in the middle of the final examination of Geology. But you stand and you've finished the exam. Did you have an "A" and all. I had my boy in the infirmary on campus. No thanks to you! Give me a break! I had finished my own final exams.

So how are your students this year? Stupid as all. I pity the future. Except you, of course. Bright. Nathan is also very smart, you know? Suppose andes always fallen on him. You okay? Yes I'm clumsy today. So? What do you think of Nathan? I think it looks cool enough. For that type. What kind? You know. That kind. The type of the above-privileged East Coast. Such!

Can not remember anything lately. One day until they had slept in the middle of a lesson. Yes! Even in the middle of a lesson, for God's sake! * Can you overcome that? [Pun untranslatable, Top = active] I liked. You know what they say, "Hate the sin, love the sinner." It is what it says. Yes I can change it one day. The female power is so strong. You'll find out soon. What do you mean? When you get married, silly. You're going to find yourself doing things for your true love ... not thought possible. I can imagine.

The Anya clearly need to get their hands on his chest. - Hello, Mrs. Gunnunderson. - Hello, darling. - It's for you. It's so good to see it. - You too. - Hello again Olaf. - Hello Abby.

Yeehoow! Oh my God! You two are completely gay. Puta! Why do not you tell me? Because I did not tell anyone here. Yes, that I realized. You just called me 'whore'? OK, and if you are gay, that hell is wrong with your clothes? I know! He thinks that will keep in the closet. No! It is they who should stay in the closet. Sure. How did you know? Well, duhhhh! Look at you two together. E. .. you ... do not mind? All I care about missing the my time trying to get you in bed. What happened to Miss Serious? Fuck this, is mainly because of your mother. And besides, I thought you liked the genre. No, Girls / the Serious / os, definitely not the kind of it. I can see this, your boy Malandreca. You will not tell my parents, right? Girl, please! Hey! You want to come drink vodka later? I'm dying to put in the drinking days. Yes! To me. Absolutely. You know what? I think I like you better this way. Who knows, I may change because of you. Dear, thou wast not so good to begin with. I love you! See? She has spirit. Yes! Yes, just ... not the kind I like. Pineapple juice. Trust me. About what are you talking about? Was able to see if the Gun come to church with me this weekend. Good luck with that. Thanks Yes, I need time. By the way, your father says that the last delivery was a bit overweight least but I let it go. I miss this place. I also have. You had bunk beds as a kid? No. My parents would never permit it. Never slept in the house friends when you were younger? No. It did not allow it. Why not? I think I saw the signs early. They fear that if I had a friend sleeping at home I might be gay. Good thing it did not. Yes, completely. You know what I realized? Do not you tell me how you made towards your parents. I think you do not want to follow my steps. It was so bad? Bad? "Bad" does not even come to describe. Continues. Okay. In my senior year of high school, my parents were out ... for business or anything, a place like Morocco, or even remember. Wait, this is an important detail? No. Not really. OK. Then it goes ahead. OK. Short version is. They returned earlier and my father, get me in bed ... Sambucca with Tony. Seriously What were you doing? Nothing! Fortunately we were sleeping. OK. This may be completely innocent. Two ... two cronies ... that if left to sleep together, after studying all night. Nus. Sure. OK, so not so innocent. No. Definitely not. And you know how I like to let me sleep with your hand ...? Simmm. And that's what my father saw when he entered. So never arrived to tell them? No. I think the exact words of my father were: "Please, never thou that in my house, never again. " Since then, never again will we again mention. But their attitude to me changed immediately. They had something serious? You and that ... type Tony? I think it was my passion for high school. But ... we ... lost completely lost touch after graduation. Do you miss him? Not when I'm with you. Good answer. I miss ... one thing that time. What? I miss the way that my mother was first discovered. What's so funny? Only the best part of Christmas. Now you can see it by the computer, you know? Yes! It's great! The kid with the blanket won awareness of the meaning of Christmas. And the other kid feels like garbage. Is quite hilarious. Yes This is your favorite part of Christmas? Look for the bald kid to beat. Love! OK. The mother wants you orders for the feast of Mancuso, okay? I'm ready. Take that, my stupid materialistic flyer! Ok, Dad. Enjoy. You know the amount of food she makes. Because you have to make cookies? And let Heather Mancuso think I'm a bad guest? Not on your life. Man! She keeps a count of scores, or what? You were really worried opinion on straight, tonight. Look up the mirror! Be. Just Be yourself, OK? - OK. And yes, I see the irony. Heather! So good to see you again. Nice to see you, Anya. As we festive! The sweaters are the same sinful matter, are not they? As you are dear! Toma! I made this batch of cakes just for you! Good and thick, the way you like. By the way, where is the handyman has been working in your house all day? Oh You mean Diego? He has been a help here. I can not imagine what he gives you. A tasty sausage? Thank you, Diego. The pleasure is mine. Never tasted the sausage of Sven, did you? I mean ... sincerely. What's the point? Olaf! What a pleasure to see you. It's really a pleasure to see you too, Mrs. Mancuso. Abby walks around here somewhere. And there are people in the back. Have fun. Want to go find the other people? Maybe they are all the to play spin the bottle somewhere. My favorite sport. Well, as ever you had kissed a girl. Kisses! Frida Bellucci, the fifth year. Seriously - Yes How was it? Well, you know. It made me gay. Seriously Should you send a thank you card. Do it. You know what always wondered? There are even eggs in eggnog [Eggnog]? No one knows for sure. What does "nog", anyway? Yes, what is the "nog"? I do not know. It is delicious, however. No, it is not. You must be friends of Dorothy. Sorry? The daughter of Fred? Dorothy? Her colleagues are? Afraid not. I am Olaf Gunnunderson. Son of Sven and Anya. That means nothing to me. That strange man. Who was he? Have no idea. And who is Fred? I have no idea. We should go look for other friends of Dorothy? In this crowd? Good luck! He is really good! It has a great voice. Yes My friends used to love it read stories to pack when we were kids. I can see it perfectly. I think is one of the reasons why he is so good teacher. Students love to hear his voice. It's really catchy. Except for this. Because never going to schools where he teaches? I mean, it would have been cheaper, right? Yes But ... The gay issue? No. Not the gay issue. Just do not want to be known as the son Professor Gunnunderson, you know? Would not sure if the other teachers treat me differently or ... if everyone would assume that I had entered for him. Makes sense. You wanted to say for yourself. Without your father. Yes Exactly! And of course there was the gay issue. Well I looked. News, bitches? I've seen that were dragged into this horrible tragedy. It is a pleasure to see you again, Abby. - You too. Hi. I never told you this before, but ... your dad is hot! I know! Well, I do not need to hear that. Too late, Q-U-E-N-T-E, hot! The Olaf is so hot? I think so. People, please. Now he is embarrassed. I have a question for you. What does he have that I do not have? I mean ... why you have changed? This ... for this. - No offense. - Not offended. So what does he have, that you do not have? Yes Besides the obvious, of course. It has the most sincere heart I've ever seen. It's beautiful. He saw your heart, is a bit disgusting. You know what I mean. It's smart. And it's funny. And it makes me feel better me even when you're around. Do. It is the most sickening thing I ever heard. Agree. Well, well ... I'll look ... a single heterosexual man who has been drinking too much. Wish me luck? Good luck! Go get them. Thank you. She has a nice ass though. A great ass. O holy night the stars are bright and resplendent ... decem; is the night the dear Savior's birth! long placed in the world in sin and error ansi ... ando, Until he appeared and the soul felt its worth. A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices, So you have fun tonight? Yes Thank you. This woman here has some lungs! Oh No! What? I think I know what that sound means. Mr. Gunnunderson! lost a toy down there? Hello Something Special, where that is the toy boys? Hello! Outside, to visit family and friends. A enjoy a little quiet? In fact, trying to contact my parents. The Olaf told me that they have buckets for you. Sorry. True, but if they had not done so ... I never would have known. Mr. Stanford, you say the sweetest things! Penalty to be completely wasted on me. Why all the best ones are gay? It's all part of God's plan. It was expected. Abby, you know the Gun longer than me. Because ... Why do you think he not made before the parents? Perhaps he counted father, but he forgot. Sometimes happens. I do not know. The truth is ... we all want to be what our parents would like. E. .. we all hide things from them. Important things, insignificant things. You do not believe in secrets that I hide from my mother. Such as? Let's just say I do I can run for president ... ... in Mexico. Good to know. But seriously I mean ... You tell your parents everything? I mean, EVERYTHING. No way. No one our age does.
