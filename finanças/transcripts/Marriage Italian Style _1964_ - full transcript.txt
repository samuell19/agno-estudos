This film is dedicated to TITINA DE FILIPPO MARRIAGE ITALIAN STYLE - What happened? - Someone's hurt! Come on. Gently! Let's take her out slowly! I'll do it myself. Gently. Give me a hand! Help her. - Who's that? - Donna Filumena. - My God, she's so pale! - What happened? - At the bakery, all of a sudden- - Open the door! - someone shouted ''Donna Filumena is sick''! - Rosalia! She hasn't been the same for days. She hasn't eaten in 15 days, poor woman. She just keeps getting hungrier and hungrier. Try to make her comfortable. - My God, what happened? - Donna Filumena is sick. Oh, my God. She's been working too hard at the bakery. Filume'. Donna Filumena. What happened to her? She got sick at the bakery. I could feel it. I knew this would happen. Take her upstairs. Gently. Call a doctor. We have to tell Don Domenico. Alfre'! Alfredo! - What happened? - Donna Filumena is sick! Come down here! - Mamma mia! - Go tell Don Domenico and call a doctor. How can I? Don Domenico has the car. - So take a taxi! Go. - A taxi! Be gentle. Don't hurt her. Yes, like that. Gently. Please! - Bring my chair back down afterwards. - You're worried about your chair? Gently, I tell you. I knew this would happen. Gently! Look, her hands are so cold. Poor girl! And Don Domenico, when he hears! I didn't even think of that. It'll hit him hard. What a shock for him. - Cashier! -Just a second! I'm coming. This will go well with your pink suit. You'll look like a queen in Paris. - Diana. - Mimi. Let's have a look at you. - There's a flaw here. - A flaw? - What flaw? - There's a flaw. - There's a flaw. - Pay attention! This angel is going to marry me. Next Saturday at the altar, she has to look prettier than the Madonna. Sorry, Counselor, but I don't have more than 200 million in cash. - And the fee of 10 million? - Are we supposed to pay that? - Where's Don Domenico? - He's back there in the ''studio.'' May I come in? - How much for the hat? - 60,000. - Don Dummi'. - What do you want? Donna Filumena is sick. Take her home. Call the doctor. I already called him, but she's very sick. She can't even talk. - Then she must be very, very sick. - She's at death's door. Alfre'! Im dealing with important matters here. Don Dummi'! It's true. Damn it. She never leaves me in peace. Never. - Certainly. - Naturally, we'll have to- Counselor, I have to step out for a few minutes. Continue bargaining with these gentlemen. But remember, this store, the two pastry shops... and the bakery on Furcella Street must be sold together... because I'm getting married, and Im moving to Rome. See you later. - Bye, darling! - Bye. - Mr. Soriano. - Yes. I'm somewhat perplexed. If you agree, Id like to get a second opinion. Go ahead. Whatever's necessary. I was thinking of Doctor Brinati from the University... but unfortunately he teaches all morning. That's all right. He can come in the afternoon. But given the patient's condition, by this afternoon- Is it really that bad? Well- Jesus. - What do we do? - Ive got it! Doctor Cardocci. Calm yourself. Ill think of someone. Do whatever it takes, even the impossible! Money is no object. Try to stay calm now. - Go tend to the patient. - At once, Doctor. And you all get out. Don Domenico doesn't look good to me. Bring him a coffee. Okay. Her injection! What are you doing here? Go back to the bakery. Oh, the coffee. Domenico. Filume'. What have you done? The doctor is coming now. We'll get a second opinion, and you'll get better. No. What do you mean, ''No''? - Yes, you will get better. - No. Not the doctor. A priest. - How is she? - She wants a priest. A priest? Run to the parish church in San Cipriano. Ask for Don Alfonso. He was her confessor. The doctor told me to bring you a coffee. He said you don't look too good. - Sugar? - Two teaspoons. Is Donna Filumena really sick? - What do we do? - It goes off every time I take off my pants! I'm scared. I'm getting out of here! - Calm down! It's just the siren. - They're bombing us! Your Eminence. Anyway, the bombing won't start for at least another 15 minutes. Madam, the siren! Come here! You've been in there an hour. Pay up! What are you talking about? I didn't have time to finish. - From 7:00 to 8:00? - We could all be dead in three minutes! Never set foot in here again! Understood? Here we go again. Long live the Leaning Tower of Pisa Save us, Mary! How are we supposed to win a war with people dressed like that? Everyone to the shelter! Schnell, Schell! The light! - Miss, aren't you coming down? - No! Why not? Come on. Ill take you to the shelter. No, there are people there. People will see me. It's dangerous here. We're close to the port, a military target. - I don't want a bomb to fall on us. - If only it would! Are you leaving? Well- - I'm scared. - So come downstairs! There are people there! I'd be so ashamed down there. - How long have you been here? - Three days. - How old are you? - Seventeen. Mamma mia! Mamma mia! - Good night. - I'm scared. I'm scared. Oh, God, I'm so scared. Girl! - You're leaving? - It's crazy to stay here! - I want to die. - And you want me to die too? What's your name? Filumena. - Let's go now, Filume'! - No! Alfre'! - You idiot! What are you doing? - What have you done? He's scared of the police. - I just suddenly- - You're a jackass! That's what it was. Assunta. Don Dummi'. You know who I am. Filumena. Filumena. You really don't remember me. The house. Fantasia Alley. Two years ago. The siren went off. Yes. You never came back. Good for you. You would have heard nothing but tears and sighs. How much do those eggs cost? Alfre', get on the bus. This young lady is riding in the car with me. - I'll take you to Naples if you want. - Of course. - We're leaving. - Wait! I need to get off. - We're leaving now. - I need to get off. - So climb out the window. - Whatever you say. Just a moment, Miss. I'll help you. Wait, Miss. I'll help you. He's peeping. Don't get fresh! Get a nice view? - Wait! - Sorry. You're on your own. Let's go now. - Do you have relatives in San Sebastiano? - No. - Where do you live now? - I'm still there. But I have the best room now. You don't wear hose? I wear... a garter belt. It's more fashionable. Don't you like it? Damn it. Rain's the last thing I needed. Looks like a bombed out house. Let's go see. Is anybody there? Anybody there? Filume'! Come here. What do you want to do? There's no one here. Anybody there? Come here. - Can't you make her leave? - How do I get rid of her? - You could insult her. - Insult her? Hey there. Hey. - Maybe we got the wrong house. - Dunno. You have a new car. It's all shiny. - Congratulations, Don Dummi'. - Thank you. - May I? - Yeah, get in. Filumena, what are you wearing? - Don't you like it? - Yes, but- You bought me these shoes. Yes, but there's a certain style. I have a new car. I wanted to take you to the Agnano racetrack. I understand. - Are you upset? - No. You just said the most wonderful thing in the world to me. You want to take me with you, and show me off in front of everyone. Like a lady. Come with me. Let's go. - But, Filume', I- - I don't know what to wear. Come on. - Let's go. Come on. - All right. Monarchists, Neapolitans! It's an honor for me to speak to you. What do you think? A dress, or a two-piece set? Whatever you want. - This? - Good Lord. - It's all ruffles. - I don't like it. - Here. This one. - This is a slip. Filume'. It's easier to take your clothes off... than get you into them. I have a little suit. - This one. - Yes, that one. - I'm not wearing any underwear. - Take it off. - Turn around. - Filume'. Turn around. - You're peeking. - Of course. What are you doing? What about our trip to Agnano, Don Dummi'? We've known each other two years, and you still call me ''Don.'' - What should I call you? - I don't know. Domenico. Mimi. All right, Don Dummi'. Domenico. - Good-bye. - Where are you going? He's taking me out to eat... then to Agnano. We'll meet elegant people there. His friends, you understand? Have a nice day, ladies! See you tonight! There's no one here. You brought me here on a day when nobody's here. There are no races on Tuesday. But Agnano is much better this way. It's more poetic. - Come on, Filume'. - Like this? All empty? Come and see. See what a beautiful view there is? Mamma mia! You can see so well from up here. The Marchioness of Bassano always sits two rows down... with this big, long naval telescope. What are you doing? To be really, truly happy... I would put my bedroom right here. There are crickets in that grass. Yes. What a handsome little boy. Do you like children, Dummi'? Dummi'. Munasterio 'e Santa Chiara My heart is black and heavy For every single night I think of Naples- What's wrong, Filume'? You're not happy anymore. Why? Are you taking me to the Royal Palace? Well- So this is how you love me? What kind of love is this? How can you live knowing that I'm up there... for anybody to enjoy. In the beginning, I tortured myself. I was sick about it. You always said, ''What do the others matter next to you? You are my man. The others don't matter.'' When I said that, I was 17. Who understands anything at that age? Then I became a woman, hand in hand with you. Filume', why do you have to spoil our evening? After all, I support you. I've never let you down. I travel, it's true. Then I come back, and who do I come back for? If only you didn't come back... I'd bury it forever, over and done with. But no. As soon as I've resigned myself, for better or worse... after six months or a year... he comes back. And we start all over again. I don't want to stay up there anymore, Dummi'. I don't want to stay there anymore. Which one's mine? Where is it? - Dummi'! - Right here. Oh, God! - Watch the shoes! - Dummi'! - Are you crazy? - Yes, Im crazy. I'm crazy! I'm crazy. It's so beautiful. Come here. Who is she? They're taking all this stuff away tomorrow morning. - Who is it? - It's me. This is the foyer. Follow me. This is the living and dining room. - Can we open the shutters? - Yes. Close your eyes. Look. Dummi'. - You know who got married? - Who? My girlfriend from Genoa. Remember her? Really? Filume', you're at home. Come inside. The lease is in your name. Come on. There is the kitchen and a small bath. - And this one? - The dining room. No, her. This woman was working part-time for the previous tenant. I thought maybe you could use her. Have a look and see if she suits you. - What's your name? - My name is Rosalia Solimene. My mother was Sofia Trombetta. She was a washerwoman. My father was Procopio Solimene. He was a blacksmith, madam. Madam. Come back tomorrow morning. Thank you, Your Excellence. Mistress of the house. - Where's the lease? - Here. Can I sit down? Should I sign it ''Filumena Marturano'' or ''Marturano Filumena''? However it comes to you. That's done. It's done. Damn. This ''n'' is too big. -Jesus. - Not a pretty signature, but it's mine. How much is the rent? The lease is 3,000 lire, but, between us, a kiss every fortnight will do. It's not enough. Raise my rent, or I'm leaving. - Good night, Alfre'. - Have a nice night, Don Dummi'. And Donna Filumena. Dummi'. It's never been as good as tonight. Isn't it true? Yes, but I have to go now. It's late. - Turn on the light. - No. Stay and sleep next to me... like husband and wife. As long as there's a sun in the sky As long as there's a sea A girl close to your heart A song to sing Let's forget the past We are countrymen of Naples 29 San Putito Street, Apartment 6. Notification of vacant residence due to death of tenant Amalia Asterita. - Is this it? - No. Yes, this is it. Let him in. Jesus. When did she die? - Mrs. Asterita? - The day before yesterday. The Housing Commissioner therefore requisitions the apartment in question and assigns it to- No, the Housing Commissioner isn't requisitioning anything. - And who are you? - Im the landlord, Domenico Soriano. And you've come to live here? No, I'm passing through. - But the residence- - Bar San Putito! Take it in there. The residence is already occupied by Miss Marturano, here present... who, for six months now, as you can see from the date on this lease- has been paying rent for the past six months... in anticipation of the painful event that was expected to occur... and has, in fact, occurred. I see. So for the past six months, you've been collecting rent from the dead... and from the living as well. Hey, you down there! There's been a mistake. The apartment is already taken. Seven. Thanks to the young lady. Good-bye. You left a mark on my neck, Filume'. I'll have to have the barber put some cream on it. Come and have a coffee. - Dummi', do you want a ride? - Thanks, Fofo'. I have my car. Does anyone have something to declare? Perfume, cigarettes? A carton. - Let's have a look at this. - It's mine. It's yours? Would you please open it? Excuse me. EISENHOWER ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES And these? What are they? As you can see, they are mostly artistic nudes. The kind of things you find stuffed into your suitcase when you go to Paris... without even knowing how they got there. Where did you buy them? First thing tomorrow morning, you can clean the store and the bathroom. - It's really disgusting. - Yes. And tell the boys not to slam down the bottles of mineral water. They've already called twice saying the empty bottles were returned broken. - Understood? Good night. - Yes, ma'am. Good night, Donna Filume'. Filumena. You're back! I've been watching you for 15 minutes. Why? Don't you recognize me anymore? Look what I bought myself in London. 35,000 lire. Handmade. They're called ''Burrow.'' You put them on your windowsill on a moonlit night... and after a month, you'll get a corn, the so-called ''Burrow corn.'' Where are you going? I have the car here. You've been gone for four months. Now you're back, and all you talk about is shoes. Let's take a walk. I have something to tell you. Dummi', there's a young man who would like to marry me. You? Yes, me. Why not? Of course. - Who is it? - Someone who knows everything about me. Who I was and who I wasn't. Dummi', I love you. I've always loved you, from the very first night. But you never loved me. I knew it. You're still punishing me because I leave you alone sometimes. Do I have to stay prisoner in Naples all the time? And it's really your fault, Filume'. If you weren't here to look after my affairs... I would be forced to stay here and take care of business. So I don't love you? If I didn't love you, I wouldn't have taken you out of that place... set up a home for you, involved you in my business. Everybody knows. You work in my stores in the full light of day. I wouldn't take you home to meet Mama, like I'd planned. - Your mama? - Yes, she found out. She wants to meet you. Follow me. Mama, may I? I brought Filumena to meet you. Show yourself. Pretty, pretty Filumena. You're Carmela's niece, right? Whatever you say, Mama. Carmela's niece. Carmela's niece. Nothing to worry about, Mama. She's having a coughing fit right now, but luckily they don't last long. Come with me. Meanwhile, Ill show you the room where- This is my room, close by. Who is this Carmela, and why am I her niece? It's nothing. Carmela was Mama's maid for many years. Her children took her over to America. To calm Mama down, Carmela promised she would send us her niece. Mama's always going on about it. ''The niece, when is the niece coming?'' You know how old people are. She's still sharp as a tack, of course, but she gets these fixations. Poor Mama. I understand. - And this is Carmela's room. - Yes, she slept here. The house is big, but there are only two bedrooms: mine and Mama's. - A kitchen? - Yes. Then there are drawing rooms and parlors. Everything's useless. You know how they used to build things. Old houses. Dummi', I'm bringing Rosali' with me. The house is big, and Mama is demanding. She even needs someone to blow her nose. Of course, whatever you want. You're the mistress of the house now. Who sleeps in the servant's room. Filume', that's not fair. Yes, because your real room is mine. Only at night, of course, because of Mama. You tiptoe across the hall, and- And find your room empty... - because who knows where you are. - Of course not! Carmela. Filumena! Carmela! What is it, Mama? What is it, Donna Matilde? The creche. The creche. The woman with the hen goes behind the ''wule.'' Behind the ''wule.'' - The woman- - The woman with the hen goes behind the wall. - Behind the wall? - Behind the ''wule''! The wall? There. Behind the ''wule''! - What's she saying? - Behind the mule. Behind the mule. Did you know Domenico spent a year at the Basilica of St. Stephen in the Round? - St. Stephen of Paris? - With Father Pio! What a bitch. Did the priest come to give the blessing? The priest comes at Easter, Mama. It's Christmas. - So he's not coming? - He comes at Easter. What a shame. - I have to pee. - Yes. The bedpan. It's under that piece of furniture behind the screen. Damn this old woman. The bedpan. Your mother was a wonderful woman. The Prefect sends you his most fervent condolences. She was of great moral character. Be brave, Don Dummi'. Think of her on the other side. - I remember her from when I was a child. - She must have gone straight to heaven. She came to pick you up from school with her pretty straw hat from Florence. What a wonderful lady. Mrs. Cuccurullo. - Domenico. - She wouldn't stay in bed. She had to come. Poor Matilde. I don't feel well. Mrs. Cuccurullo. Mrs. Cuccurullo. A coffee. Mrs. Cuccurullo is unwell. - Do you know this Cuccurullo? - I've never seen her. Wait a minute. There you go. No, Filume'. Do you want people to see you? At a moment like this? - For the Madonna! - Will you give an offering, miss? - Miss. - For the Madonna! Thank you, miss. Thank you, miss! - Miss? - Thanks to the Madonna. - Good morning, Donna Filume'. - Where is he? Back there. Where else? Cashier! Filume'. Good. You brought the Easter eggs. Yes. A surprise. Father. Is she really dying? What is that doctor waiting for? We need a second opinion. My son. My son. Be honest, do you really love this woman? We've been together many years. You know our story. I know it. I know it all. Dummi'. Come here. Alfre', here. Damn it. Shut up. Domenico Soriano... will you take Filumena Marturano, here present, for your lawful wedded wife... according to the rite of our Holy Roman Church? Yes. And you, Filumena Marturano... will you take Domenico Soriano, here present, for your lawful wedded husband... according to the rite of our Holy Roman Church? Yes. Shut up. I now pronounce you husband and wife. - Don Alfo', fix your hair. - Yes. You go over there, and you come here. Here. Eat. Well done, my son. You did a good deed. There will be one more soul in Heaven. Don Alfo', thank you. - Hello? Is that you, Diana? - Yes, darling. - Are you finished? - Yes, nearly. What happened? Did they make the deal? Looks like it. They're waiting for you in the lawyer's office. 200 million in cash and the rest in promissory notes. And, Mimi... the print shop is asking me what we want on our invitations. No, it's urgent, Mimi. At the latest, our friends will get them after we're married. It doesn't change anything. I don't know. Maybe in a little while. Yes. The poor woman is dying. Dummi', I'm right here. The poor woman is here, alive! The Madonna had mercy on me! We're husband and wife! She's come back from the dead! - Filume'! - What do you want? A trick! How could you? And how could you do so many other things? I let you change the cashier one, two, three times. The first one: I rose above it. ''Filume', you need a rest.'' Fine. Let's rest. The second: Luckily, she left you. And the third one you want to marry. That disgusting brat. You all knew about this! You knew! Out! Get out of my house! And you too! - And you! - Im at home, under my husband's roof. Even the police couldn't get me out of here. Whore! You started out a whore, and you still are. You're talking about your wife. What wife? Yours. Mrs. Soriano. Me. I'll kill you and give you three cents for it. That's how much they charge for a woman like you. Three cents! And these two dirt bags who helped you! I'll kill all of you! So it will be a mass murder. Where is my revolver? Our Lady of Carmelo! In a box in the dresser. Don't make a mess, I just ironed your shirts. Idiot! You're an idiot, and you stink! - Mamma mia! - Lord in Heaven! Fuck you! Mother of God! Don Dummi', what have you done? Get out! Wait, it hurts. My knee. My heart. My heart. - He's in there. - Who's in there? Don Domenico is having a heart attack. He's dying! He's not dying, Doctor. How can he have a heart attack without a heart? - What are we, statues? - Move it! Come on, girls. Perk up. Show some life. Such is love It comes and goes It always gives us both joy and pain - Are you from Naples? - No. - Are you a lawyer? - No. What the hell do you do then? Come on, let's go. Or not. At once. Filumena, there's a call for you. Me? Who is it? No idea. Hello? In San Sebastiano al Vesuvio? Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Damn it. Which way was it? I always came on the bus. On the bus! Like the first time we met you. Why? Do you have someone special here? Alfre', shut up. Go that way. Annunziata! - Where is she? - Annunzia', the mistress. - Ma'am. - Annunzia'. - How is he? - He's in there, asleep. He's asleep? He's sleeping! Michele. Little Michele. - He woke up. - He's okay now. But last night, we were terrified. - Really? - He was having seizures. I was losing my mind! I said to my husband, ''God forbid something happens! What am I going to say to the mistress? Go and call her.'' And my husband said, ''At this hour?'' And I said, ''Yes, at this hour. Go now. Wake up the operator.'' You were right to call me. Come here, Michele. Little Michele. - You don't want to? - He wants me. What can you do? Little Michele. Come here. Let me hold you. My little Michele. How did this happen? Damn you. - Has the doctor seen him? - Yes, the doctor saw him. He asked me right away, ''What did this baby eat?'' I told him, ''Doctor, he ate a kilo of cherries and the pits too.'' - The pits too? - That's right. He pumped his stomach and gave him a very strong laxative. Really strong. - My God, what's happening? - The laxative! Do it for Mama. Do it for Mama. The pits. What a handsome boy. The pits. Don't say anything to Don Domenico about this. Not about the car, or anything else. Understood? - Understood, Alfre'? - Yes. No. Repeat after me: ''I understand.'' I understand. Such a beautiful little boy. Four woolen undershirts... three pairs of underwear and two pairs of little socks. And such a beautiful mama, with her boy in her arms. So beautiful. What happened? Filume'... I'll marry both of you. I'll marry you, even with him. Alfre', let's go. It's getting late. Sorry. Alfre', I have two more. Alfre', will you stop it? Two more? - Should we give them some baba? - Don't be silly. Rum baba? - Hello, ma'am. - Hello, ma'am. Ricca'. Umbe'. Ma'am, are you going to give us pastries like last time? Don't eat too many. Eat. Careful. Don't get dirty or the nuns will make a fuss. This is how you eat pastries: In one bite. Watch out, or you'll get a stomachache. Donna Filume'. I'll marry all three of you. Damn it. What did I just say? I'll marry you with all three of them. Alfre', my boys are all that matter to me. You can't give them what he does without even knowing it. What Domenico Soriano gives them. - You shouldn't get up. - I'm fine! - Get away from me. All of you! - Mamma mia! - Get out! - No! Go ahead, Rosalia. Only a female like you could sink this low. You've stayed the same. Twenty-two years couldn't change you. I'll press charges. I'll accuse you of fraud, all of you! You, the doctor, the priest. When I tell them who you were and where I found you... they'll have to take my side. I'll destroy you, Filume'! Ill destroy you! Oh, God. Sit down. Are you finished? First, regarding where you found me. Is that news to anyone? And besides, what were you doing there? I rest my case. Second, you say the doctor and the priest helped me. They knew nothing. Even the doctor believed everything. Why wouldn't he? After 22 years with you, any woman would be at death's door. I've been your servant for 22 years. I ran the bakery on Furcella Street and the pastry shops. I kept house better than a wife. I even washed your feet, and your mother's, may she rest in peace. Not only now that I'm 40. But when I was young! And always like a servant, who you could kick out anytime you want. If I had ever seen you act submissive... or aware of our true situation- You always had an insolent scowl on your face. If I had ever seen a tear in those eyes- All these years, Ive never seen you cry. Never! Was I supposed to cry over you? The furniture was too nice. Dummi', do you know when a person cries? When they know happiness, but can't have it. I don't even know what happiness is. I never had the satisfaction of crying. You always treated me like the last woman on earth. God knows we have to atone for our sins, but how long do we have to pay for them? Now you're 50, and you come home with your disgusting handkerchiefs covered in lipstick. - Where are they? - I saved them. Good. Now go. You don't even try to hide it. ''What if Filumena finds them? What will she do? Who is Filumena anyway? What right does she have?'' Then a month ago, you made a fool of yourself over that disgusting girl! A man of 50 with a 20-year-old! What do you care if she's 20 or 22? I don't! I don't care about you at all anymore. You're useful for now, and that's it. After 22 years, did you think I'd just go away? - With nothing but my hands to cover me? - Money! That's the real reason. I would have given it to you anyway, without this whole charade! Shut up. That's all you understand, money. It's something else I want from you. And you're going to give it to me. I have three children, Dummi'. What? What are you talking about? Three children? Three. - Did you know about this? - Yes, I knew. Good, now go. - Who are their fathers? - Men like you. Filume', what do you mean? You were all the same to me, the men who came to that place. My oldest will be 20 in May. He's a student. The second- Don't give me that look. They're not yours. Do they know you? What do they do? Where are they? How do they survive? - How did you raise them? - With your money. I've been stealing from you all this time. I raised them and put them through school with your money. So these three boys I don't even know can laugh in my face if I ever meet them. - They don't even know you exist! - I just pay the checks! What was I supposed to do? Kill them? That's what all my friends in that place told me to do. ''What are you doing? Are you crazy? Don't even think about it.'' No one ever said a kind word to me, helped me, gave me any advice. I had to find all the answers on my own. Alone! Now they're all grown up. Donna Filume', you're a saint! Rosalia, go cry somewhere else. A saint? You're a devil. You're a poisonous woodworm... destroying everything you touch. Now tell me, if you don't want money, what do you want? Dummi', I'm sick of hiding and watching them grow up from a distance. They have to know who I am. They have to love me! I need that, Dummi'! And they're grown up now. I don't want them to be ashamed when they apply for a document or some kind of paper. They need a name... the same name as me! - What name is that? - Soriano. I knew it! I just wanted to hear you say it. I will never allow three strangers to set foot in my house, dead or alive! - I swear it! - Don't swear! I swore an oath once, and I've spent 22 years begging you for charity because of it. - What if you need my charity one day? - Your charity? She wants to bring them into my house! Her sons, with my name! Those sons of a- - Of a what? - Of yours. Of a whore. Damned woman. Now you made me lose my voice. He's awake, Donna Filume'. Good morning, Don Dummi'. Did you sleep well? Why are you dressed like that? - What's going on in this house? - We're doing some odd jobs. Cleaning. May I? - What are you doing? - Im taking the bedside table. - Where? - Donna Filumena ordered me- What did you say? Alfre'! Come here! Damn it. What's happening to me? Luci', get the new sheets when you're done. They're tied together with a red ribbon. Yes. Rosalia, put the clothes in the closet. Winter wear goes in the bags and shoes in the cabinet behind the screen. The cabinet behind the screen! - Mama's room! - No, that's Mrs. Soriano's room. Wretched woman, you're crazy! Dummi', I won't sleep in the servant's room anymore. Put everything back! Exactly like it was before. Go and put those clothes in the closet! - Mamma mia! - Exactly like it was before. What's this? A dorm? It's for my sons. They'll be a little crowded, but I've been so generous with them until now. You'll be hearing from my lawyer. We'll see what happens then! You can go to the Eternal Father himself as far as Im concerned. I'll have the police throw you all out. Especially you! I'll send you back where I found you. They shut them all down, Dummi'. Under the provisions of Articles 101, 110, 121, 122 and others... your position is not lawful. Understood? - Law isn't a favorite of mine. - We gathered as much, miss. From a legal point of view... to be frank, you have committed fraud, although perhaps unknowingly. Article 101. ''Marriage in imminent risk of death.'' ''In the case of imminent risk of death-'' etc. It explains all the possible conditions. But you weren't in imminent risk of death... because your illness was fictional, my dear. There are witnesses. Alfredo, Lucia, Rosalia. As soon as the priest left, she got out of bed and told me... ''Dummi', we are husband and wife.'' That falls under Article 122, ''Violence and Error.'' ''A marriage may be contested... by a spouse whose consent was extorted by violence... or excluded due to error.'' I didn't understand a word. Filume', I married you because you were going to die. No, marriage cannot be subject to conditions. Shut it. You didn't understand either. Counselor, explain it in Neapolitan. This is the article. Read it yourself. I can't read, and I won't accept that paper. In short, since you weren't about to die, the marriage is annulled. It's not valid. Do you understand? - And the priest? - He'll say the same thing. - Of course. - He'll even say you desecrated a sacrament. It's not valid. - It's not valid. I'd have to die. - That's right. - And if I had died? - It would be perfectly valid. So that's justice? The law cannot uphold some principle of yours, human as it might be. It would become accessory to a plot perpetrated at the expense of a third party. And Don Domenico Soriano has no intention of marrying you. Is that clear? Do you understand now? No. But I believe it. It must be true. You know why? You calmed down. You look like the master of the house again. Counselor, proceed. Me neither. I don't want you either. Yes, Counselor, proceed. I don't want him either. I wasn't dying. I wanted to commit fraud. I wanted to steal a family name. But the only law I knew was my own, the kind Dummi' laughs at. Not the kind that makes you cry. Sorry. Alfre', come here! Go and get them right away. All three. All three? Yes. Two of them are here. The youngest is missing, the plumber. The mechanic? Rosalia, help me. My hands are shaking. I've waited so long for this moment. And now I'm scared. - Scared of what? - What do I say? And how? - What will they say? - I know what they'll say. They'll say, ''Thank you, Mama,'' for all the sacrifices you made for them. - Let's just make you pretty now. - Yes. Put some lipstick on. - No. - You'll go out like that, pale as death? I want to look like a mama, Rosali'. Here you are. The mistress is coming. Have some sweets while you're waiting. Help yourselves. I gave them some sweets. Hey... haven't I seen you somewhere before? Did you go to the Nazareth School? The one up on- No, I was at the Sant'Antonio La Palma Home for Boys. - Were they Ursuline nuns? - No, they weren't. Come in here. You can have a pastry too. - Hello. - Hello. - Got a match? - No. And you, guy? Who you calling ''guy''? Do I know you? Sorry. Let me introduce myself. Michele Esposito. - Really? Esposito? - My name's Esposito too. We'd make a nice family portrait, the three of us. Esposito. The Espositos. - Did you get this invitation too? - Yeah, we got it too. - What are you waiting for? Go in! - Wait a second. Leave me alone. This lady can't spell anything. - Who is this Filumena Marturano? - Haven't you heard of her? - She's a- - Come on, do us a favor. Everybody knows her. She's famous. She's retired now, but before- - What does she want from us? - I dunno. It's like a detective story. - How many cigarettes you smoke a day, boy? - Four or five. - How old are you? - Fifteen. This will only take a minute. Make yourself comfortable, Counselor. Miss. Well, then. Can we put an end to this mess? The lawyer has prepared all the papers. Let's go into the study. What? Did you change your mind? - Who's in there? - Don't go in there. Go wait in the study. Ill be right there. Don't worry about your papers. Ill sign them. - I've already packed my bags. Right, Rosali'? - Yes. I'll let you go, Dummi', but Ill never abandon my children. Go. - Why, Filume'? - Let go of me. Who are you anyway? You want to stop me from telling my own children they're mine? Counselor, the law allows me that much, doesn't it? Don't worry about me, Dummi'. Im strong. You know that. I'm the woman who never cries. Look at me. My face is dry. - Go in the study. I'll be right there. - You're crazy. Have a seat, Counselor. Yes, it's me. It's really me, Michele. That crazy lady who finds excuses to come to the filling station and see what you're up to. You know me too, don't you, Ricca'? The lady who buys gloves from you... and makes you show me every pair in the store. - But you have never seen me before. - No. And yet we've eaten together so many times, Umbe'. Where? In your favorite trattoria near the hospital. You at the table by the window, and me at the one facing yours. Of course, you never saw me. You're always absorbed in your studies. Even while you're eating. This isn't a detective story, like Michele said. It's a drama, a big one... because... you are my children. What are you doing there? Go wash the car. Move it. Go. You know those slums... in Virgene, in Furcella, in Tribunale, in Pallunetto? Black and smoky. In the summer, you can barely breathe. There's no light there, not even at noon. I lived in one of those slums with my family. There were so many of us, crammed together. I don't know what happened to my family. I don't want to know. I don't remember. Always scowling, always fighting with each other. We went to bed without saying ''Good night'' and got up without saying ''Good morning.'' And the heat, what heat. At dinner, we sat around the table. One big plate and who knows how many forks. Only once did my father show any interest in me. When I think of it, I start to tremble. I was 16. He said, ''You're grown up now. You know we have nothing to eat here.'' Sixteen. Elegant young ladies would pass by with their pretty shoes. I watched them. They passed by arm in arm with their boyfriends. There was a man who helped me sometimes. A baker. He would give me taralli, fresh bread. That oven was such a comfort in the winter. But my father was right. I was all grown up. The baker noticed. One day, I met a friend of mine. I almost didn't recognize her, she was so well-dressed. Or maybe any old thing looked nice to me then. She told me this and that. This and that. Forgive me. Maybe it would be better for you to have nothing at all... than a mother like that. Is that right? It isn't? - Then come and give me a kiss. - My hands are all dirty. It doesn't matter. Stupid me. I'm sorry. I didn't know there was a lady like you on the other side of the door. Ricca'. Where are you going, boy? Let him go. That's his character. Ricca'. - What are you doing? - You're leaving? - Why? - What are you doing? - Where are you going? - Ricca'! Come back. Did they clear out yet? Alfre', I'm annoyed with you too! Are we going to be here all night? Can we put an end to this comedy of errors in my house? What are we doing here when the sun's out? Wait for me by the front door. I have some business with the master of the house. Ill join you in a minute. I'm ready. Where's the lawyer? He left. I can't keep all of Naples here at your beck and call. He left the papers here. Here's a pen. - Do you want me to read it to you? - No, I'm fine. Here are the keys to the house, the closets, everything. I'll send for my things tomorrow. - Should I sign it? - Yes, here. You're crazy. You could have just taken some money without making such a fuss. You wanted to destroy those boys' peace of mind? Why did you tell them? Dummi', one of them is yours. Who would believe that? One of them is yours. Shut up. I could have told you all three were yours. You would have believed it. I'd make you believe it. But just one of them is yours. It's not true. It can't be. You would have told me right away to keep me tied down. Tied down? You would have made me kill him. I'm the only reason he's alive... your son. Which one is he? I don't remember. They're all equals to me. Donna Filumena, come and see. Riccardo waited for you too. He's downstairs at the front door. I knew he would. Which one? You can see for yourself. They're equal. All three must be equal. They're equal. They're your sons. I don't know them, and I don't want to. Get out. I'm leaving. Don't worry. Wait for me downstairs. Just a minute, Dummi'. One night you said, ''Filume', let's pretend we love each other.'' I truly loved you that night, but you didn't. You just pretended. When you left, you gave me the usual 100 lire. These 100 lire. I wrote down the day and the year. Then you left as usual. When you came back, I had a belly. I had them tell you I wasn't well and I went to the countryside. I'll keep these numbers... the date that I wrote down. That's it. For you. Children are free. What's wrong with you, Dummi'? Nothing. I'm going to get a coffee. Do you feel sick? Should I come with you? No, I'll be right back. Stay there. Maybe- Here it is! Mathematical proof! Alfre', look at this. - Are you asleep? - No, I was thinking. Don't think. Look! That lady from Milan. The surgeon's wife. She had nice legs. Look there under my name. ''Bellagio, Summer 1946. Three heavenly months, Marisetta.'' If I was with Marisetta in heavenly Bellagio... I couldn't have been here messing around with Filumena. Add it up, nine months. At least that one can't be mine. Unless he was born premature. The glove salesman? Premature? A strapping young man like him? Damn it. August, July, June, May- Don't yawn! Go make some coffee. - I still think the key is the 100-lire note. - I told you no! I think they went out of circulation after the Americans came. No, sir. I asked at the bank. They were in circulation until '51. Only the 50-lire notes were recalled. Just my damn luck! If I had given her 50 lire, I could figure it out. But no. Mimi Soriano was always the big man. Damned idiot! Let's add it up again. The glove salesman was premature. The mechanic- Damn it, now I remember. We ruled him out. We were in Paris with the horses. Then in London. I even have the stamps in my passport. Alfre', swear to me again that you don't know. I swear. You don't feel it in your bones? I feel like I made a lot of mistakes. I ran and ran, but I never reached the finish line. Filumena. I've been waiting for you for 10 days. I've practically become a policeman. What do you want? To talk! How can I talk with you standing there like that? Anyway... I want to hear you say that what you told me was a lie. Now that you've calmed down... it's only right that I should be able to calm down too. There isn't a single thing you said that wasn't made up out of thin air. Not to mention that story about the date on the 100-lire note. Come on, Filume'! You're illiterate! You need an entire plaza to write down one sentence. Imagine that! That's true. But there are only three numbers in a date. I can do that. Besides, I didn't write them down with the intention of blackmailing anyone. It was an important night. Beautiful. How can you not remember it? What year was it? Were we occupied by the Germans? The Americans? What suit was I wearing? What shoes? You're completely deranged. You remember the year, the day you bought a pair of shoes. - But you can't remember- - What am I supposed to do? Twenty years! The more the world changes, the more it stays the same. Houses, palaces, skyscrapers. And in the middle... an old story like ours. It's old because you want it to be old. There are skyscrapers in America too... and inside those skyscrapers there are old stories. That's not the problem. The problem is that our hearts used to be so big... and now look how small they are. Here. Filume'. You're leaving just like that? What are you doing? You're wearing lipstick again? - How old are you? - Fifteen. You asked me that yesterday. - So you were born in '49. - That's right. - What month? - March 25. You want to read me my horoscope? Excuse me. All done. - What's wrong with the car? - Dunno. Let's see. Could you move, sir? Some idiot pulled the wires out of your spark plugs. You should start locking your hood. Then they won't play pranks on you. - How much do I owe you? - Nothing. You can tip the boy. Clean the gentleman's windshield! Good-bye. Maybe there's not enough talc. - We have the same hands. - No, I wear an eight. You wear a nine. The size isn't important. It's the shape that matters. If I may? The middle finger is the same. The thumb. - The thumb isn't. - They're not the same. They're not exactly the same, but they're close. They're not the same at all. Ricca'. Excuse me one moment. - Hello, miss. I expected you yesterday. - Hello. - Your package is ready. - Thank you. - You get prettier every day. - Thank you. Be on time tonight. See you at 8:00. Don't forget. - Good-bye. - Bye. - You like women, don't you? - Yes, I do. Angelina, you wait on him, or Im going to punch him. He's an old fairy. That's enough, Filumena. Enough. You have to tell me which one... is my son. You have to tell me, Filume'. If you don't, I don't know what might happen! Now I understand why you wanted to take me to the top of Vesuvius. You want to throw me off. You want to know? I'll tell you. Maybe it's better this way. You can help him. - He's not earning any money right now. - The student. Yes, Umberto. Umberto. Of course. He's chosen a difficult path. But if he studies, if he puts his mind to it- Of course, to study, he can't live there in the middle of all the confusion in your house. There are too many of you. Study is demanding. He needs- And besides, when he introduces himself at the University... Soriano's son- Wait a minute. So it's the one who needs my help the most, is it? What's a mama supposed to do? She has to try to help the weakest. But you didn't fall for it. You're clever. - It's Riccardo, the merchant. - The glove salesman? - No, it's Michele, the mechanic. - Again? You want my back against the wall until the very end! Can't you see? As soon as I told you it was the student, you started thinking about helping him... about giving him money! To him, yes... but not the other two! What would happen then? Don't you understand that money would set them against each other? Don't be so selfish, Dummi'! Stop thinking about yourself! Don't think about me either. Let's leave things the way they are... and go our separate ways. Tonight I'm taking the car, and I'm going to tell your sons the truth. ''I'm rich. I'm this, that and the other. One of you is my son. Now you all figure out who is my heir.'' Dummi'! Leave them alone! - Let me go! - Don't set them against each other! - Let me go! - Stay away from them, for God's sake! Let go of me! Remember I told you to stay away from my children! I'll kill you! I mean it! Not the way I heard it from you for the last 20 years. Shut your mouth! Shut it! All three of them have to be equals! - All three! - Be still! - I'll kill you! - Shut up! - I'll kill you! - Shut up! I've always loved you, Dummi'. Even more now than before. - Hello. - Hello. Were you talking about something? - You stopped talking. - We were just gossiping, Don Dummi'. Sit down. It's already 6:00 a.m. And your mother, as usual- I never liked ''Don Dummi'.'' You didn't tell us what to call you. I didn't tell you because I thought you would figure it out on your own. I'm about to marry your mother if she shows up. You never know with her. Tomorrow you'll all bear my name: Soriano. Do any of you like horses, the racetrack? - Why are you laughing? - What are we supposed to bet with? I liked to sing when I was young. It was a hobby, a passion for me. - Do any of you sing? - Not me. - Me neither. - I do. - You sing? - Sure. Sing for me. Do you know ''Munasterio 'e Santa Chiara''? - That song is old. -Just sing the refrain. - I can't sing in the sacristy. -Just do it quietly. Just to hear your voice. Come on, Miche', sing. Munasterio 'e Santa Chiara My heart is black and heavy I can sing like that too. Where are you hiding this voice? - That's my voice! - If that's a voice, I'm Enrico Caruso. Yes! You try. Sing. I wouldn't dare. Im not as bold as this guy. -Just a little bit? - Yes. Munasterio 'e Santa Chiara My heart- - How does it go? - My heart is black and heavy For every single night I think of Naples as it once was I think of Naples as it is now No, it's not true No, I won't believe it I'm dying from longing to return to Naples But what can I do? Im afraid to return Quiet! This is impossible. Three Neapolitans who can't sing. It's disgusting. - Congratulations, Donna Filume'! - Thank you! This dress is crooked. Only you see this flaw, Donna Filumena. I've been making dresses for years. You've got some nerve. So you're denying the obvious? Fine. If you say it's crooked, it's crooked. If it makes you happy, it's crooked. - Donna Filume', you're so beautiful! - I hope nothing's missing. I feel so out of place this morning. You look lovely, Filume'. You look like a girl again. My boss is great, but his wife! - And you want to stay at the gas station? - Yes. I like it. These shoes are too tight. - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - These darn shoes! - Take them off if they bother you. - Congratulations! What a beautiful ceremony. - Congratulations! I'm so tired. Will you bring me a glass of water? Kiss her good night. Mama needs to rest. - Sleep well, Mama. - Bye, Ricca'. - What, you're leaving? - Good-bye, Mama. - We're going. Mama's tired. - Good-bye. - Sleep well, Mama. - Little Michele. - See you tomorrow. - Good-bye, Don Dummi'. Good-bye, Dad. - Good-bye, Dad. - Good-bye, Dad. - See you tomorrow? - Yes! See you tomorrow. Let's go. Come on. What is it, Filume'? I'm crying, Dummi'. It's so wonderful to cry.
