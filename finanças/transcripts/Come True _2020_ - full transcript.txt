Yeah, I... I can ask my mom when she gets back on Thursday. I wouldn't ask my dad, 'cause he'll just say "no" and give some stupid arbitrary reason why. You're sure it's okay, though? Yeah, of course. What are you gonna do tonight, though? Sarah? Fuck yourselves! Freak. Such a weirdo. Hey. - Hey. - You okay? I'm gonna grab a coffee. You want anything? Yeah, I'll have another. Sarah? Come on in. Have you ever had any difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep? Uh, lately. Yes. Okay. Do you drink coffee, tea, or any other caffeinated beverages? And if so, how many per day? Coffee. Usually I'll have about three to six cups a day. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sleeping disorders? Uh, sleepwalking? Night terrors? Insomnia? No. Not officially. I used to sleepwalk as a kid, but I haven't in years. Okay. And you'll be okay to attend for the full two-month period? - Yes. - Perfect. Great. So, we really just show up and sleep? Yeah. That's it. Well, uh, we'll have you hooked up to a bunch of stuff and ask you a few questions every morning. But other than that... we just need you lying there in REM. REM? Uh, Rapid Eye Movement. It's the stage of sleep where we dream the most vividly. Well, thanks for coming down, Sarah. I'll send your application over to our head of faculty and we'll likely contact you tomorrow if you're chosen to be a part of the study. When would we be starting? Uh, Monday. I hope to see you then. Okay, bye. What? You okay? Yeah. I'm good. Really? Really. 'Cause, you know, it would be okay if you weren't. I know. You have no idea how good this feels. Just to be in a bed and... in a house. Thank you. Goodnight. Mm. Sweet dreams. Can't believe it took me this long to figure out how to make money when sleeping. I'm sure your wife is more than happy with the peace and quiet. - Well, I know I am. Um, are, uh... are you the only girl in this study? Uh, no, there's another in my room. Emily. Oh, cool. Is this your first sleeping clinic? Yup. You guys? Yeah. I've done a couple. Oh, hey. What about you? I've, uh... I've been coming to these things since I was five. Aaron and I actually go way back. I was 16 when I first started coming here. I guess ol' Meyer loves to see us sleep. Meyer? Doctor Meyer. He's, uh... He's head of the department. You guys will meet him later. He, uh, usually does the exit interviews. Perfect fit. Come, sit down and we'll get your headset on. Everyone has to wear these? I'm afraid so. It's how we get the information from you over to us in the control room. Okay... Excuse me? Hi, sorry, um... Michael told me to come down this way. Yeah, hi, Emily. You're in the right place, don't worry. You can just have a seat and I'll be with you in one second. Okay. Thank you. - Hi. - Hey. How many of us are in the study? Uh, six. Two females and four males. How come there's more guys? I can't tell you that. Well, what are you studying? I can't tell you that either. I told you to hurry. Well, Riff had me installing the new drivers. It's okay. You can watch me do Emily's, and then I'll get you to help apply the guys' next door. - Cool. - Okay. - Hi. - Hey. I'll get Sarah up and running so you can start with Emily now. Great. Thank you. - I'll be right back. - Okay. You're almost set. How long till we're ready to go? I'd say about another hour before everyone's connected and settled. Okay. Great. Stage one, the eyes close. A reduction in activity between wakefulness. The patient can be awakened without difficulty, but if woken at this stage, the person will not feel as if they have slept. Many have a feeling of falling during the first five to ten minutes of sleep, which can cause a sudden muscle contraction called...? Hypnic myoclonia? Very good, Lyle. Now, watch the EEG and the EOG. Some of them are entering stage two. We'll now see some peaks and valleys indicating periods of muscle tone and muscle relaxation. The SYNC will also show us a slowing of the heart rate and a decrease in core temperature. Their bodies are preparing them for deep sleep. Stage three and four... Slow wave... Delta. Wake them now, and for a moment, they'll have no idea where they are. Now we wait. In a bit, we'll start seeing some entry into REM. It's like clockwork. Yes. Well, for most people it is. Are we ready? Recording. There. Whose feed is that? That's in A. Sarah Dunn. And... do you feel well rested? Yeah, I do actually. Uh, more rested or less rested than you usually feel when sleeping at home? Definitely more rested. That's great. Now just a few more questions and then we'll be done for today. Okay. That good, huh? I read that in one sitting. Hm. Couldn't put it down. It's really good. Yeah? Hm. There's a... a kind of... a haunting sadness to it. You should definitely buy it. Have you read much Philip K. Dick? No, not... not much. He was completely paranoid. Genius concepts, though. His stuff will make you think. Thanks. I'll give him a try. You won't be sorry. You have to get me a job there because I'm practically a professional sleeper! If I got paid to sleep, I can't even imagine... Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. What? I'm trying to avoid that guy. - Who? - The... Up there in the trench coat and the glasses. I met him in a bookstore earlier. I just... I just don't feel like being social, okay? Come on. Okay. You like him. Shut up! Okay, lie down. All set. Um, Anita will be by in a bit. Is Emily coming tonight? Uh, she's probably just running late. Or dropped out. It happens all the time on these things. Goodnight, Sarah. 'Night. And... this one? No. Nothing. So, you have no reaction to this image, correct? Correct. Okay. To be honest, I can't really tell what any of these are. Yes, we know. Bear with us. I still don't really see or... or feel anything. Uh... I mean... some hands, maybe, holding something? Is Emily still in the study? Probably not. Is something wrong? No. People usually lose interest after the first couple nights. You know, realize they don't like sleeping in a strange place or whatever, but... we'll have a replacement in Room A as soon as we can. So you... you... you talked to her, right? No. But this happens all the time. There are no-shows in every cycle. It's just part... Guys... I'm sorry, but we have four more of these to do until I get to go home and sleep. Okay, Sarah. Last one for today. Sarah? Sarah, are you...? Get Riff! Hurry! Is she okay? She seems to be now. No... I wasn't following you. Really? Then how come I kept seeing you everywhere? Hm... You were sitting there... watching me sleep. And you just thought, "Hey... "Since I don't ever leave my nerd den, "this is probably my best chance to meet the future Mrs. Nerd, "so if I just follow her around, "maybe she'll fall for my magical fucking nerd charms!" Please don't quit our study on account of my actions. I'm not quitting because of you. I'm quitting because I just had the worst panic attack of my life and none of you people will tell me why. Okay, Sarah. Last one for today. Sarah? Sarah, are you...? Get Riff! Hurry! And what did you think would happen when you showed these images to her? I... Dr. MEYER: This isn't a joke, Anita. This is the first time anyone has ever done this. And we have to be more than careful about how it's handled. We'll either be hailed or crucified based on our treatment of this breakthrough. We never... There's no more unauthorized testing, Anita. I don't care what Riff says. We just wanted to see if they remember. Well, it's obvious that they do. So... let's go back to acting like scientists again, okay? Now, that means collecting the data and then studying it within the bounds of decency. We won't deviate from your methods again. Thank you. I'll be by later tonight to monitor. Hey. Zo? Hello? Young lady! Wake up! Wake up! I didn't want to wake you, but those boys, they stole something from you. What? The boys, they took something from you, and then they ran off, so I woke you. How long was I... Fuck! Oh, no, no, no... Zoe? Zoe! Please be home. Please be home. Zo! Zo, come on! Zoe, come on, please. Hey, nerd! Hey. What were those pictures Anita showed me this morning? I can't tell you that. I'm not coming back till you do. So, you're not quitting? I won't quit or tell anyone you were stalking me... If... if...? If you tell me what you're studying. - It's not happening. - Please. I'm starting to get scared, okay? Ever since this morning, it's... I have never felt so weird. But if I show you, it... it could completely compromise the results... No, listen to me. I think your science project is fucking me up! If I leave, doesn't that compromise your results? All right, come on. Come on! I'm not kidding. If I show this to you... you cannot tell anyone. First off... you'll notice that I'm putting this on my own head... so that you'll trust me that there's nothing to be afraid of. Now, a few years ago, some brilliant neuroscientist from Berkeley figured out a way to decode the images our minds process... um, what we see... and export the data... ...as a moving image. No way. That is so cool. It is! And... and I immediately thought about where we could apply it. So I spent the last few years tweaking this loaner to make it able to see things even more amazing. You guys are watching our dreams? Yes! Obviously I can't show you yours, as we've already seen what potentially happens when even a single frame is recounted by the dreamer. I think I can safely cue up a feed of someone else's from last night. Those are his dreams? No. No, he's still falling asleep. See? These are hypnagogic experiences. It's his brain trying to make sense of the reduced input it's receiving as he loses consciousness. That is so weird. And fascinating. Look at the pictures and the shapes left floating around in his mind. It's actually quite beautiful. If I remember correctly, I... I think he had a pretty scary dream off the top. I might have to cut it short. Are my dreams that messed up? Sometimes. We all have nightmares. This is nuts. Don't you ever feel like you're seeing something that you're not supposed to? I... I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't have a reason, Sarah. Which is? Fuck. Uh, we... we have to go. Come on. I held up my end... See you inside. That's new. It is. Let's clean it up a bit. How is this happening? They all have their own unique hypnagogic and narrative episodes, but eventually... they end up here like this. I've been seeing these things in my own dreams since I was six years old. There's countless records throughout history, across varying cultures and yet for some reason we always figure out a way to simply discount them as... just dreams. It's fucking scary finding what really makes us tick. Lyle, can you grab this in 4K? - Dunn's coming out of REM. - Fuck! Her pulse is really fucking elevated. Sarah? Sarah! Sarah, are you okay? Fuck this place! No, I'm not okay! Look, you just had a nightmare. I know I had a nightmare! What was it about, Anita? Huh? Did you see them? Yeah, I know what you're doing so you can shut the fuck up! I'm fucking done with this! I'll be right back. Keep watching the others! Sarah! Your eye. What is going on, Riff?! - Nothing. - Meyer's coming in at 2! What do I tell him?! Keep monitoring the others! I'll be back before then! Bill! Is Zoe here tonight? Might be. I just got here. Can I go in and check? - He has two minutes. - Yep. Then he's gonna explain to us how she knew. Yes. He is. I think one of the guys in C is waking up. It's Will. They're both waking up. No... Look at the room... Their vitals. It's happening. Lyle, get Riff. Right now! What's going on? Where's Riff again? He had to run home for something, but he should be back any minute. Well, I just don't want him to miss this. This is exactly what he's been waiting for. Hey! Is she okay? I feel bad about having them go through this. Must be horrible. It is. But this is a natural function. And if we're going to understand it, we need this data. These images... they prove a kind of a primal connection to this icon. A unified fear of this shadow with eyes. Their vitals aren't changing. Discreetly get in there and re-connect their SYNCS. Should we wake them? There. No fuckin' way. What? Michael... Michael, what is it? Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! You gotta wake up! You gotta wake up! Hey. Hey. Um, I'll be right back. Oh, weird question. Can I sleep on your couch tonight? Of course. I lost my phone. And I have nowhere else to go. Why "Riff"? You ever see the Rocky Horror? Of course. You remember Riff-Raff? Oh... I get it. You're Meyer's Igor. You know, you're smart for your age. I'm 18. I saw your dream. Sarah? Oh, Sarah... Are there any relatives, next-of-kin we can contact? I don't know. I don't know her very well. Hello?! Nurse! Hello?! Where is everyone? On the second floor, I... I... I have a friend that's being treated up there and I don't know where she is now. There's no nurses at the front desk. What's your friend's name? Dunn. Sarah Dunn. - Sarah... - Dunn. Sarah... Dunn. She's in 237. No! No, she's not. She's... that's what I'm telling you, she's not there! Sir, please calm down. We will find out where she is. Let me call a nurse on the second... But there's no one up there! I'm tell... I'm telling you. Jerry, can you run up to the second and find Rachel or Kiki for me? This gentleman's looking for a patient's whereabouts. I told you there's no one up there. They probably had to move her due to tonight's staffing shortage. Um, why don't you take a seat over by the desk and I'll give you a call when we have her new location. Okay, thanks. I just... I'm... I'm just... I'm worried about her. Sarah! Sarah! It's me, Jeremy! Sarah! Sarah... Sarah... It's me, Jeremy. Wake up. Wake up. Augh! Where the fuck have you been?! Look, I can't explain right now. Are you at the lab? Yes! I'm here and I'm cleaning up your mess. I... I really need you right now. No! No! You have fucked up all of our lives! We'll be lucky if we ever do another study... I know, I'm sorry, it's just... something's happened to Sarah Dunn and I... I just really need you to come out... What did you do? I really fucked up. Just one more thing and we're done. Anita, please. Then we're done. - What the fuck, Riff?! - Where's the stuff? The trunk. Why don't we take her back to the hospital? 'Cause she's not safe there. They have no clue what's happening to her. No more than we do. It's up. It's a nightmare. It's... it's good. It can help us get her out. You keep watching her. I'll make sure that she's safe. So, we try to wake her at the height of her nightmare? Yes. The body tries to reject death in dreams. You wake up. What if you're wrong? I don't know. Anything? Nothing yet. Look, how much further should we really let her continue... Whoa, whoa, whoa. This isn't making any sense. I thought she was headed somewhere familiar, or... Wait! I see something. I've never seen or dreamt of this many before. When one of them comes close or touches her, she'll expel herself from the dream. Riff, I don't want to do this anymore. Let's call a cab, okay? Let's get out of here, leave! Just... just keep watching. Sarah... Hey, I'm right here. I'm here. What happened? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. We couldn't wake you... We couldn't wake you. You saw? - You saw? - Yes. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Are you certain this is the way that we came in? Where did you get this? I found it out in the field. This is my phone. You lost it out here? I've never been here! Look, maybe you've had an episode like this before and you came and you dropped... What time is it? What the fuck? What time does it say it is? Run! No! No... Just keep breathing. No...!
