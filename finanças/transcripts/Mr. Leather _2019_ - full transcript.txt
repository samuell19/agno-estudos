I am your host. Welcome to the Fantasy Island! Let's get to the facts. This is Mr. D. No, this is an actor representing Mr. D. Actually, he's not even an actor... He's just the hot brother of our producer, Cecilia. Mr. D is one of the precursors of the leather scene in Brazil... And this is the story of his death. THE DEATH OF A LEATHERBOY 14 years ago... When Mr. D arrived in the leather scene in Sao Paulo city... The scene practically did not exist. Mr. D had the idea of making the first Leather party in the city: "A Leather Men Night." At the first party, they had only two people: Mr. D and Barbudo. After 13 years the Leather Men Night has become one of the most important leather parties in the country. And one of the starting point of the Leather scene. Mr. D worked hard in favor of community growth... And for a long time he thought of holding the first Mr. Leather contest in Brazil. But faced a series of obstacles, and the main one was: The place to hold the contest. And here comes our third character. The "Eagle". Eagle is a cruising bar in Sao Paulo that knowing the idea of Mr. D... Proposed to hold the first contest in Brazil. With the coordination of Mr. D... The first Mr. Leather contest was performed. This way Barbudo was elected the first Mr. Leather Brazil. The backstage of the contest was not at all smooth... However, let's limit ourselves to saying that there were a lot of people. Including Mr. D... Dissatisfied with the great favoritism of Barbudo. Let's to 2018. After being placed tenth in the International Mr. Leather in Chicago... And an exemplary reign of Barbudo... The Eagle decided to change the contest a little in the second year. And invited Barbudo to take over the contest coordination in place of Mr. D. But he did this without communicating to the Mr. D. Feeling betrayed, rejected and despised... Mr. D did what everyone sensible does today: Exposes everything on Facebook. In the post, he accuses Barbudo of betrayal, and calls him usurper. And ends saying in quotes: "From great betrayals begin the major renovations"... Closes quotes. In a post with just over 100 words... Mr. D put an end to a friendship of more than 13 years. Barbudo, obviously... Did what all sensible people living in the age of technology would do: Wrote a letter in response to Mr. D on his website... And shared it on their Facebook. The Eagle remains silent on the subject until to this day. On the internet... Mr. D put his leather pieces for sale. And one piece was bought by 3 different people. After selling all the clothes... Mr. D put on Facebook a message of mourning communicating his death to the Leather community. He was no more a Leather Man. So, without a wake or party... Say goodbye one of the precursors of Leather in Brazil. I am Dom Barbudo. A BDSM practitioner. And I am the first Mr. Leather Brazil. I was elected in 2017. And in 2018 will be elected the next Mr. Leather Brazil. This contest takes place in several countries around the world... And there the winner goes... Have a chance to go to Chicago... And run for International Mr. Leather. Leather is not a social grade, Leather is... A philosophy, a lifestyle is... it's a play with the body, a discovery of a new sexuality. I say leather is the second time you walk out of the closet... You know? 'Cause you leave the closet, you discover your sexuality and soon... Soon you discover leather or BDSM. BDSM we can say... That these practices of fetish or domination and submission... They are in mythologies, this is very old. In the last times, aesthetics... One of the aesthetics of BDSM... Which is that of harness, corset... Jackets, pants, and black. Was elaborating and was picking up the clothes in Leather. And the gay community, mainly, identified a lot. This sash, it's forever and it's one... Of the most special things, I have in my life... It's not just in the Leather anymore. Now I'm sure I'll stop using it in respect to the next Mr. Leather. However, I made good use of it. Slept with it, showered it, did everything I could with my sash. I had sex wearing it, of course. LEATHER DINNER. - Hi. - How are you? - Fine, and you? - All right. - Hi, how are you? - The benefits of being the host of the night - I'm the first one to arrive. - How are you? - How is it going? - How are you? Cool? - It's all right? - How are you? - What's up? - Very well? - Yes. - Look who's there, and how's it going? - I went to look for a mirror, I said so leave it still... - I loved it. - No, I even wanted to go to Chicago, but it's expensive for us. - Finished last year, I made my reservation. - Maybe we win the lottery or... something like that. - Or take 3 winning ticket, I will sell and I will go to Chicago... - No, but I did some sewing on it here... - The tailor reinforced rather in some places, it was almost redone. - She thinks that Goias state it's just country culture, right? - And it's not? - He's going to accuse me in my fucking face. - No. - Oh, surely! - You have not seen the country singers duo I brought? - My own country singers duo? - Waiting in my car. - We're going to leave and we'll present somewhere. - Who are the jurors anyway? - There are 5 jurors. - It's Heitor, Anderson... - That bald boy there, the... - The Big Brother guy... - And the guy from the Gay Guide Sao Paulo. - Hi, good night, how are you? - Tam OK. - What's up? It's OK? I already thought you were not coming. How are you? - I do not know what your religion is, I do not know what you believe in, but I think - It's the purpose... - I think it's part of... the purpose. - It is when you... - Win the contest triples your visibility... - If some people were looking for you... - it's going to increase a lot. - It's tripled, do you understand? Already! - Can I ask for one more photo? Then I bring them all... - Alisson, let's take it... -...All. - It has to be Alisson! - Where's Def? - You want to smoke and no one allows, right? - Okay, Deh is missing. - Where is he? - Where's Deh?

If anyone had been worried about this in the... Last year I would have beautiful pictures today, I do not have any beautiful ones.. - No photo, right? - So you have to thank that... - This is for history. - Send the photos to us, right? - Look, no one can say that about me. - I slept two hours to put those pictures in the cloud. DEH LEATHER. Last year... I saw the invite, right? I was starting to get to know the Leather community here in Sao Paulo, I was... 6,7 months I was attending the parties... Because I had no contact here in Sao Paulo, right. I live in countryside. And the staff was announcing: "we'll have the contest, we will apply” Then I said, "Oh cool, come on." I fulfilled my initiative. I looked at the possibilities, talked to... People I know, other Mr. Leathers from the outside the country. They encouraged me and said: "I think it's a good thing, the scene is starting... It's important that everyone participate... And stakeholder participation" which also has an exposure. So not everyone who can apply, who... you wish to apply, you can do so. And other needs... Go to parties, promote, make this happen. So, I guess this put a lot of people in check who applied. From the last contest, only I signed up again. When we talk, when we're in the Leather culture... There comes a certain imagination in people's heads. Join with BDSM. Trampling, for example. There are people who like to be stepped on, right? And it is seen as wrong, as submissive. It is a submission, but seen as a negative point. And not as a source of pleasure. Inside gay community there is a lot of it. We realize this... And I think that's why the contest is important... To be able to demystify this subject a little... That the purpose here is not to get hurt... And neither suffer... Violence than... The limit that... the person can bear. - "Hi Fran, I want to know something about the boys" "Do you believe that it is possible Brazil have visibility out of the country " "On Leather scene?" - Dom Barbudo can answer it this, all right? Look, I can say this... In another countries... - What a man! - Hi Mom. - It's all right. - I'm doing a photo shoot, I'll call you later. - Goodbye. He likes a classic image of Leather... Then, he alludes to "Tom of Finland". Tom of Finland... I jerked off a lot to him. You are assimilated. Fan of "Today I Wank To Go Back Alone". You must be wondering... "Who the hell is this Tom of Finland guy?" Well, there's even a movie about him. But the film is so bad that even Andre Fischer hated. Tom is a Finnish cartoonist who became very popular in the 60's. Mainly among consumers of homoerotic art. In other words: Tom is a pornographer, fetishist, gay. The main characteristics of his drawings are the hyper masculinized men. Fetishists. All with big dicks. His main character was Kake. A bike, in love with boots. Whose correct pronunciation of your name in Finnish is cock. Another famous character is Sailor. Same traits, another uniform. Rough, beautiful and cruel men. Tom, like every good pornographer, found erotica in the most diverse situations and symbols. Turning everything into sex and pleasure. Tom always said: "I worked hard to make sure the men I drew had pride in the sex they practiced and were happy to do it... When I was 5, 6 years old. There were movies from the 50's and 60's, that I watched on TV. There were movies with James Dean. Marlon Brando... Movies that were... Leather movies that... showed rebellion. "The Wild One” with Marlon Brando... "Rebel Without a Cause" with James Dean... I was raised... With movies... From the 60's, 50's, 70's. Movies that really marked me... - We were already at his house... - HUSBANDS. - In the closet and found lots of leather. I got very scared. At that time I knew nothing. I got scared. I said: This guy is kind of crazy. He's going to lock me here and torture me... or something like that... Which is a wrong image that people from the outside have, right? One of the movies that most marked my life. I also saw in my childhood... I was 6, 7 years old. It's a film with Marlon Brando called "The Wild One" And... It shows a lot: leather jackets, leather gloves... Bikers. A gang of bikers. Going against the system. And they exude masculinity. And that seeking for freedom. To seek rebellion. This... was very important to me in those days, and it is still. I think it was a seed planted in my childhood. In my unconscious is that sexy face... That mighty guy, that manly guy. And in my story, in my images... Of films that we build during our lives. They had these Leather men. And I've always felt a spell on them. And I think that's the biggest meaning. DOM PC I made a separation, not to create this false idea in people's minds. I'm from Leather and I'm from BDSM. And I have both intricacies, together. The two things for me are together, but also aren't. You can be a BDSM who practices... Domination, submission, bondage... Sadomasochism and everything. And also you can be a Leatherman. There is that separation... Although I think in the imagination, in the construction they are together... Because it's amazing people come from leather... When they do not do that association with Village People, YMCA... Or people already do this... That intention: "but are you going to hit me?" "Are you going to torture me?" No. No, not necessarily. In my case, yes. I mean: I like it. In the 70's with the pandemic. Then in the 80's with... The press starting to talk about “gay cancer”... The leather community invented the initials SSC “sane, safe, consensual”. Not BDSM, it was the opposite. To show that people were doing sex, but they were... Consensual, it was healthy and it was safe. I'm at number 360. Safe to say about 340 went to the first session. To initialize people... In the practice is something that not everyone has... Patience for. And I have a major turn on for it. That first fear... Of the dominator that is going to arrive. Often without knowing. Wanting to surrender, obey that man. That prototype, that macho, and... That lack of air, that panic. FETISH 148. Can I say something else? Sorry to interrupt and all... But I think it would be very coal... If you come walking with chains on your feet. Come. Sit here. Right here in the corner. That's it, put your feet up, wait! - Can you smell it? Pull the air... Slowly. Now let go. Again. Slowly... Feel how close the leather is. Feel the Leather you're near to. Can you feel pressure? Limit, right? Look how you're a slave. Feeling your leash? Pretty submissive. Stuck... No chance to scape. Totally surrendered. That's how I like it. Are you horny? Like this? That... Hardcore? I got the chills, are you feeling it? Let your pleasure go, that's it. Give me your pleasure. Moan if you want. I'll do something that will hurt you a lot. - Mrs. Lalinha. - Priscila... A kiss for you too. Let me see, Elaine Beatriz. Lita... It's ... Thalita. Someone else listening... Look, a lot of people, a kiss for everyone... Where are the hearts on our Live, where hearts? You can call the next one. Estela, a kiss for Estela too, thank you. To Maria Lovati, thank you. Babs: "Fran, when you go to Natal City... you will see what a wonderful sea they have". I'm talking about the sea of Santos City and Natal City seems even better. Right? For sure. ...To everyone and even my mother! Kisses mother, Gabizinha. My mother, look how fantastic! Watching. Ma, Vitor... A kiss! Look how delicious. "You speak your name because cuz we have no idea how to say it." - Maoriguy "Maori, the Maori, can I call just Maori?" - You can. You I allow. Mr Leather, Mr. Yeah, I'm paralyzed I looked at his face, I was excited, right? Thinking about his butt tomorrow... "Because of your profession, right?" You could not expose yourself, could you? Suddenly you said: "I'll take over, I'll expose myself and I'll be a candidate.” - For sure. "How is it being to you?" It's very well. It's normal, very well. Of course... I stay tuned. I take care with many things. I'll broadcast here... I get it, I'll broadcast it here... That we're having an external recording so they can understand it too. We're talking about single sessions as well. Inside BDSM. Inside the Leather community... We see a lot that does not have... DS, domination, submission. The relationship between the dominator and the submissive. Look... Let's talk about it. - There is, there is plenty. - Is it quiet for you? Separate is also quiet. A break to talk about clothes. This jacket, she has a story that... Remember the beginning of my life in Leather... And she was from my uncle, from the 70's. I stole his jacket from him. One day when he arrived by motorcycle with his friends. I hid the jacket under my mattress... And he never found the jacket again. And I used her a lot to masturbate and... And everything related to the desire with Leather. I found this jacket at a thrift store in Paris... On a trip, ten years ago. And it's my sweetheart! The smell of it is amazing... You know? Which brings me back to the wonderful times. I bought it in January, this year in January. It was in Quito in Ecuador. I was walking there... When I hit the eye, I said "wow", I found the jacket I wanted. My first Leather jacket. This one is a very simple design. It is even a thinner Leather and not so bright. However, was the first... Therefore, it has all that meaning... Open the doors. Very thick, very heavy Leather. It's the style Perfecto, what we call... This cut style. Thick, shiny Leather. Harley Davidson jacket. I had already bought two jackets and then I was in Barcelona. In the neighborhood of Boqueria passing by a store... A super simple store. He had several jackets... When I saw the price of that jacket I said, "Fuck it, I'll take it." And I was undecided if I bought more or not... Because of the weight of the suitcase, so I decided to buy it at the last minute. All sewn, this one is lambskin. I have some pieces that will match that white... I chose to wear this jacket here in the end. I got it from my brother. He rode a motorcycle, it did not give so much value and he ended up passing to me. And I always take her... In each party. It's full zipper, so it actually starts... There behind the zipper and ends here in front. Her style is called fucker pants, by Mr. B. Until I get Mr.B's pants. This one was my traditional pants... Of Leather that I had made here in Sao Paulo. I rarely wore these pants... Now I have combined her a little more... With my riding boots. I say chap, but I think the correct word would be chaps. What would this... Pants, maybe almost pants. However, it is just the leg. I created, drew and made... Tn my size, I think a chaps must have the size... Suitable for fitting the body. The touch of Leather on the skin is perfect. I also like the breacher. It is wider on top. This model looks like... From the Nazi uniforms of World War IL. I applied a patch of Mr. Leather Brazil. Only who participated in the contest can use. At all of Leather's events, when it was very hot, I would go with it. In Brazil, always very hot, that is, I only used it practically. A leather shirt. That there is a total close. My style is half a highway police officer. I really like the Full Leather, so the leather shirt... It's always a component of the Full Leather style. I ordered these clothes. In my size. And the regatta. They are different pieces, right? What people wear on the Leather scene... In the community, because I like this more modern, more differentiated thing. My famous harness. This harness here is my favorite part of my Leather piece. To me it does not mean much. It means something like... I'm kind of stuck on Leather, you know. It is a symbol of Leather culture. Nowadays those who do not have their harness... I even have some colorful ones with neon etc. But I only wear black. Covers the whole breast, it goes down... Come the cock ring and... This ribbon here goes behind. Jockstrap can't be missed. I got it from an ex-boyfriend of mine that when... He went to Spain. I begged him to bring something for me. Then he discovered that I liked leather. Bracelets... The colors... They all have a lot of... Meaning in leather, right? Usually dominators use in the left side... The submissive use in the right. And the switchers , which are the ones that are dominators and... Submissive, use both fists. You cannot miss cap. This cap I bought here in Brazil. A local model. Very cool, I really enjoyed it. And I was one of the first ones to go on the scene with him in Sao Paulo. Now you must have seen that it has become a trend... Have several people with him too. My favorite pieces are the bottom clothes I really like the vintage style of leather, I love boots. My sweethearts... Beginning with my... My favorite is this one. This boot is an American brand, Dener. This one refers a little more to biker style. I bought from the Republican National Guard of Portugal. The shoelaces in the region of the instep. This one here is a boot that I had to make on measure. This one is a military boot of cavalry. Leather of alligator. And that model of her is called "Aladdin”, right? These... The same style, but this one is ostrich leather. Keeping in line country, only now... The boot with a square beak. Keeping the country style that are those of round beaks. This one is a Sendra too. This one I bought in Paris. Similar to Sendra here is the one I bought recently in Madrid. This one has the combination with snake leather. And, of course, this one I'm using right now... It's also one of my favorites... Which I bought in Barcelona, which is Miura as well. Same style as Sendra. To guard, look what I learned recently... TIP On my last trip. To store these boots that have the highest bootleg... So that the bootleg will not bend. And then begin to deform the boot, without being on the foot. You keep in... Keep a bottle of water inside the bootleg. And my boots... My favorite brand is Doc Martens. I bought out of the country. - That's it? - Yes! Each piece of these costs around R$ 700,00. If you buy here in Brazil, right? If we buy out, we're talking about € 400,00. $ 400. Who has that money? It's very expensive. It is very difficult for you to cut an animal and turn it into clothing. Because you need some tools, you only need to sew leather. I have a machine that sews only leather. There's some lines that's all leather. That leaves everything expensive... It's cheaper for me to catch a plane and go to Buenos Aires... And buy their leather than come back. So that discourages us. We do not have a law that favors importation. We do not have a very smart fashion law. Now... Anyone from the Leather community... I did not want to stay with a person. Leather at a party. And for not being unanimous... And be expensive. Especially... She still has a way to go. To end prejudice. It is very connected to fetishism. Which has more prejudice, especially inside LGBT community. LGBT community is based on heteronormativity. Then he has difficulty getting out of... The closet, as Heitor Werneck said. For the second time being a fetishist. The 80's I think was the burial of creativity, you know? That Brazil has become old-fashioned. Brazil is retrograde. Retrograde thinking came with this new generation. She herself is retrograde and selective. You see a Leatherman from the 70's. A Full Leather Leatherman. They... They say different things, right? I think everything is different, ideals are different. This style, Tom Of Finland's classic... That is the bare chest, 3 jacket with nothing underneath. Or just a leather pants and a boot. I do not like these categorizations... And staying apart in clans and communities... Because you can circulate by all. I am part of a group of BLUF. Breeches and Leather Fanclub Uniform. And there, indeed... You cannot... Post a photo that shows some hair from your chest. I did it because the boys did a BLUF... But here in Brazil does not work. Must have 3 people... From the Leather World from here in Brazil. And for me to communicate with outsiders... It does not influence anything; I want to fuck, right? Are you recording that? They don't accept a shirtless photo. They don't accept a photo with a non-Leather shirt. Why? There is a lot of restriction. These "gringas” things are all full of code. Full of restraint. You cannot talk about some subjects. We're in a politically correct Leather. In this case... Full Leather. - Tomorrow will be what? - Jockstrap Parade . For those who do not know, it's that leather underwear... At the front there is a leather and from behind the naked butt. - Did you practice enough your butt? - Yes - Look this voice...Yes... - Because I believe... - I left it pretty, shaved off. The jurors will judge the butt size? -I guess so. - They will look? - Will have butt shaved off, hairy butt, fat butt, muscular butt. - Agita Planeta Radio will try to infiltrate in there to... - Great to know that you're going to cover everything there. - We are going. Agita Radio going to be there? Yes, will be there? #agitaplaneta. Mr. Leather Brazil Contest! It was a success, thank God. So can I give 3 hug to the winner? - Francine said she was coming to cover, why did not she come? She said she would be the first woman to enter the Eagle - She even asked me to, but... We were right on that point... If it opens for her we have to open it for all then... She sent her representative who's going to do the live here today with us... But it will not happen. In fact, this was not a decision... We copied a mold of... London. That's a men's house for men. Turn to a gay and say, "Would you take your mother to the Eagle"? Everybody says no. Because everyone knows what the concept behind the Eagle name is. And here in Sao Paulo too it lives up to the name Eagle. There are several Eagles around the world, each one owned... Each one follows its philosophy... When the Eagle came up here, she followed the philosophy of the Eagle of London... That soon changed. In the old days... The Eagle of London was more like the project we have. Today is a gay bar for men, women. It's a censorship. It's a censorship because... We might be adding more people to the group. The power of our community is growing. Outside there is International Miss Leather. Leather competition for women, understand? Why here is like this? Good evening guys, I'm Marcelo Arantes. Many people know me because I'm a former Big Brother participant. JURORS - But I do many other things, too. My name is Welton Trindade and I am from Gay Guide Sao Paulo. We are 3 national network, network guide that... It is that guide Brasilia, Sao Paulo, Salvador, Belo Horizonte etc. I sell Tupperware. I do everything I have to do. The only thing I ask of everyone... For people in the gay community... And the Leather community... It's just that you think politically. Because we have to be represented. We do not have anyone representing us. I am not really enjoying seeing growth of mini-groups. Each one is its own owner, but we go together continue with this very cool move. For the jurors, the notes today are 0 to 10 for each candidate. The one with the highest score in the end will be the winner. Kake. Being effeminate and the Leather World... Discourse. I think there's room for anyone... In Leather World. There's a lot of this kind stuff out there... Anyone can be chubby, can be effeminate, can be woman. Transsexuals, drags, Leather. Here in Brazil we are more sexist. You have to be that stereotype, strong, manly type, another things. I think this is a myth that has to be demystified I think when you get a prize like that... And you will represent an entire class. So it's very important what you have inside and what you think about it. What I always say to people is that we are walking... As a community we have a trust in the other. And we expect this to be maintained. Our community has been suffering some issues... People call themselves Leather... Just because of the clothes, simply because they have the money, right? Because this clothes are not cheap. It is not an outfit that is easy to get. However, you are not simply Leather for having clothes. You have this very strong affiliation with a pornstar. Which I think is great, is not critical. You have almost a open marriage, right? Then you win. How do we will... Expose all our concern with STDs With relationships, with 3 hypocritical society. And, especially, with the gay society that is very hypocritical society... That she barely assumes. I can give you the example of my husbands... They had completely wrong references of what was the Leather community. Of what fetishes were. Today they understand everything, today they support me. I have idea of making some partnerships. Mostly with some entities... That militate in this area of STDs, AIDS. I've already started talking to some representatives of these entities. To do projects and actions... Aimed at the LGBT population and the fetishist population. However, they talk a lot with the new generation... That they think the rights are guaranteed. And no, rights can be withdrawn. It is seen there several homophobic candidates or even against the LGBT cause. The evangelical's politicians are an example. Leather Community is here supporting. We are representing here this moment and I'm very happy, because I have, in my case, medical training And to have that honor, this opportunity... to talk about it. And how are we going to do this? Disclosing. In radio, broadcasting on TV, broadcasting in newspaper, on internet. With that same militancy, ok? To unite the community. To be letting her get bigger and bigger, to demystify all this... Thing that people thinks is stronger that us. Why do I like Tom Of Finland so much? Why do I like Kake so much? Because as I told you before... One of my main ideals in relation to Leather and in relation also... My life, in relation to my sexuality, to being gay. It's freedom. The question of Madonna taking the... the issue of BDSM and latex... human nature is an example. That was influencing me. Seeing Rob Halford. Seeing a designer who is Peter Marino, who works with leather. It does architecture from various clothing brands like Dior, Chanel. I say my origin of the fetish is the cowboy. - If you win this so important contest and represent Brazil there in Chicago. And they ask you what the best thing in Brazil. What will you answer? - Our diversity. - Sympathy. - Very hot, the Brazilian is like that. - Affectivity! - Charisma, I think. Thank you all for the attention. All the candidates and the jurors are also grateful for the attention. We finished the first phase. At 2 AM the contest returns with the jockstrap parade. See you all, thank you. Who has the biggest cock will win. I think they have some interesting candidates. Some, who are more prepared, have more knowledge of the Leather community... Than the others. They are quite different candidates from each other. With quite different proposals. I thought the Dom PC was very nervous, he stuttered at the answers. I think Kake very interesting because he is... Videomaker, because he is youtuber, because he works on television. I think it's very interesting. Kake is a big surprise. But also, for example, one of the candidates that I think... Who has been here since the beginning, it's Deh Leather. I, in particular, closely follow his trajectory. I think Deh very interesting for being a teacher... And I think Maori is very interesting for being Fashion. The Maoriguy, his analysis was not deep. My favorite, also by approach, because I know more, is Dom PC. Which, I have nothing to explain. Because he is my owner? If I cheer for someone else, I'll pick it up later. The PCI know in depth, I know he travels, I know he speaks many languages. I know he's not ashamed. Doctor, from a traditional family, wearing fetish, then there is a not 50 Shades of Gray guy... He's not a fool. The big surprise for me was Kake, who I thought he was a character... And I saw that he was very involved with the Leather community. He has very interesting ideas, which will bring very good results... If he's Mr. Leather. I'm more curious about today's stage because of the jockstrap parade. Jockstrap I can speak very well because I go to every jockstrap party... I have lots of jockstraps, 5o this is my favorite phase. Not only because we will see the candidates naked, but because I think it very sexy. I want to see if a jockstrap was well chosen. If the person is comfortable walking in the middle of the people with a jockstrap. If it is comfortable, if she is new, if she was well cared for. How that person is going to show. Tomorrow we have the last phase... And will we know who will put the sash... From Mr. Leather, I expect all of you here. Good night. I'm going to define this jockstrap parade in two words: A Disaster! What? Jockstrap is one of the most... It did not have to be so unheard of like that. I was surprised by this... It seemed that we were showing nudity with the guys of jockstrap. - How are you? The belly? Nervous? - Very anxious. - Very anxious? - Because I'm shy, people? - We notice he's very shy, right? Tm afraid of what I said earlier. Of not being able to... Reach... To supply, right? To supply... All... All this popularity. That will grow if I win And it's not just here. You, one of you will represent Brazil in Chicago. That too, because... For everyone to understand, the sash, not only put the... Sash and go represent Brazil and come back. No, it's the 365 days... Until the next contest you have to be Mr. Leather. Nice. Nice. Is good. - It takes to know that they will like it, because there is another thing. - Oh, Yes It's another story. This is not it. It's completely different. I'm going to talk about... Your identification with leather, with Tom Of Finland... Get here in this story and what you think about culture. Then we sexualize. - You know? - Fine. Talk about your relationship, your lifestyle And that's it, inside the leather, or not. As you have this Tom of Finland thing you will... Sorry, I think you look like a porn actor, so... It's OK. We go around, I go around in my head, understand? Fine. However, without... You do not have to pick up your dick... Get naked, touch the chest. Take off your clothes for... Or put on your clothes, get your clothes off. Put on clothes, be with it. Keep in the clothes. I like being with her. I like to lick the person with the smell of leather. Got it. Here we have the beginning of a Leather scene. We do not have a community yet, we do not have... A representative taking off the Barbudo and this future Mr. Leather. Barbudo did a very nice job of taking... The Leather out there. He went everywhere, I know that. He got this sash, he stayed... He went, gave his face to hit, even with the restrictions of society work. I also wanted to do some kind of... In the same scene, like Barbudo... Assemble a scene of Leather even, and record in chroma key . Because I already got the studio. He, to me, what is interesting, is to record his channel now. Because he does not experience Leather like that. It facilitates, fantastically. It was cool to register these people who made the Leather happen... That's why I'm doing it, the movie... And for them to be an example instead of these... Appropriators. You're a guy who came from Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo. In Rio you already had this identification with leather? Yes. My identification with leather is from my child age. You can have separate Leather from BDSM or close to BDSM... So, I do not cut too much is... The practices of BDSM. I'll tell you why. The pain for me is opposite to the pleasure, if I feel pain I lose the pleasure. But on the other side, I'm a sadist. I like to mistreat the person a little. Why is it taking so long? It's already past midnight. Are you going to have the parade? Are you going to have each one's speech? That faggot gonna talk again? That? - No, just we will talk. - OK, that's good. The four of us. Speech of the candidates. Parade and speech. We're talking about getting the dick out. Remove or retain leather. You're welcome to me. - You have me for one... But I see a lot of people coming... With a superiority, with an empowerment and... And being discriminating and boring with 2 ok of stuff, you know? - Yes. It bothers me. - What do you think, in Leather culture, that not have here? - Integration. Integration between people. Integration, not forming groups, but a community. I Think this sense of... Integration is what is lacking. Of course, you have to study, you have to read, you have to... Know where the culture comes from, all that, but... I think, mainly, what is missing here... That we have to start working on this, right? It is the sense of integration. Between people. - Are they Safe and Consensual? - No. I'll do it with Barbudo. Because otherwise I'll ask the same questions for the same people. For example, I want to get Cigar and... To talk about others encounters... Orkut, so for me it ended there. Then I interview Barbudo otherwise. Good luck. - Like it? I got three votes for you yesterday. I can't keep on campaigning for you. - Yes. - It's shit. Let's make it clear that... I do not like Leather just now, understand? I didn't just get into Leather now. I think... I've always had this in my life. Ten years ago I decided... Exteriorize this for me, understand? I came out of the closet with Leather. I attended some events... I was out of Leather publicly, OK? But in the community itself, I really joined recently. You will show yourself, you go to your work... You go to your family, you go to your friends... No, Leather and he says: "Look at this link, I'm sending it to you, vote for me... Vote for me that I'm going to be Mr. Leather." But, what is Mr. Leather? I'm going to represent the Leather community. Does it create visibility? Yes. Do people understand? Do they respect? Do you understand what that means? I don't know. But I think 2 public vote... In terms of strength. In terms of representativeness. As a member of this community. I Think it would make sense in the community. The Dom PC is a very well known, very dear person... From everyone, the community has been in the community for years. I think many people... Cheer for him to win. However... speaking in terms of popularity, I'm much more popular than him. On social networks, let's put it this way. How did I win the first phase of the contest? That's not the point. I think it's a matter of action. Presence. What did you do? Okay, you want to be a representative, okay? But until here, what did you do? Where did you go all this time? In relation to this community that you want to represent. I think the contest could have something in that aspect that values this. Two sides there. I felt a lot of people welcoming me... Dom Barbudo mainly, he's a wonderful godfather, you know? An exceptional person... But I also felt a lot of people repudiating me. This guy from another country coming in, understand? "Another country". Getting there, among us, you cannot do that, understand? You're not going to your birthday party... You're a colleague and you want to blow the cake candle. You can not get to the party and you want to blow the candle. Because I think, there are other people... They are already working, they are already in that community and... They are closer. Nor is it a question of meritocracy. I am not in this dialogue of meritocracy, no. Not even. Is not it. But it is a matter of common sense. The four studied, the four prepared and... I was very happy with... This result, in fact, I thought one of the two would win. Rodrigo or PC. By the way they led, by their participation in... Community with different thoughts. With different aims, but with two proposals... They would lead to some kind of growth. All votes were counted. In 4th place, with 57 points... Was the Maoriguy. Thank you so much Maori for the participation. In 3rd place, with 73 points... It was Deh Leather. Many thanks Deh Leather. Thank you guys! For obvious reasons I won't say who's 2nd place, but I will say the final score. 2nd place was 76 points, right? With 83 points was our Mr. Leather Brazil 2018: Everything that the contest brings, the moment it ends, it also leads, right? So this phase is a phase of transition. I... I already had some participation in the middle before... And this will continue because I am like this. It's not because I have a title that I have changed a lot of what I already did, but... Of course, a certain phase of my life ends... It was perhaps the most special of the last years. IML 2017 - International Mr. Leather. - We hope you represent us well. - I'm all broken up. - The microphone. - Guys, thank you... Thank you. - I knew it, we knew it.
