[flute playing] [tribal dance music] [screeching] [eerie music] [music stops abruptly] [eerie music] [Obinwa screams] [inhales loudly, pants] [sighs] [crickets stridulate, birds tweet] [Nneka] My husband, I am going to the market. Uh-huh. The money. Mmm… here. So, erm… Your uniform is on the line. It is still wet, so… Don't worry, a little water won't kill it. Hurry. Don't be late to work today. See you later. -Bye bye, O! -Bye. [sighs] [drumming music] -[drumming music stops] -[chuckles] [Obinwa whistles] [Obinwa] Chief! Chief! Chief! Chief! How's it going? Ah. Hey! [motorbike engine revs] [upbeat music] [Mr. Osagie] How many times have I said not to bring chewing stick to this office? Don't you brush your teeth at home? Where is your partner? Where is he? Come late to this office one more time. Try me, and come late just one more time! Are you listening to me? How many fingers can you see? Come late one more time, and I'll deduct your salary by half… Half! Nonsense. [Obinwa] Sorry, sir. [Musa] Bro, at least try to show up earlier for once. This is not a matter of coming early. -Good morning sir! -Hello bro! [tuts] I am tired of this job. Every day the same story: "I'm tired, I'm tired…" Why don't you stop complaining and just quit? If I quit the job, how will I survive? Or do I look like a spirit that doesn't get hungry? [laughs] Erm… You are… [spits] You are… [elephant trumpets] -You are… -Good morning, madam… -You are… -[both laugh] Don't these people get tired of using their mobile phones? -[car brakes squeal] -Sorry… I'm sorry, sorry. [laughing] City people, that's all they know. They are either on WhatsApp or Facebook. Or this new one… I forgot what it's called. Insta… Instachat! Or… Snapgram! There's this girl, always sending me sexy pictures. I don't understand how someone can be aloof in real life. But that person will be so friendly on a digital device. Isn't that madness? City madness. That's why I despise this urban way of life. Eh! It has turned everyone into a slave. -Hello ma! -Sisterly! -Something for the boys? -Nothing is too little. Wow, look at your shoes! -Sister! -[Musa chuckles] You know what? City people don't know how to enjoy life. I tell you. City life is boring. Which life is more interesting? Let me break it down for you. If I make a lot of money… The first thing I will do is: I'll buy land. After I buy land, then I will build a house. After I build a house, I will make a farm. That's it! Life has begun! Our ancestors knew how to live the good life. The real African life. -Really? -Yes! Why don't you go and join our ancestors? Forget that nonsense. I'll tell you. I've gone through hell in Lagos. I can't keep living like this at this stage in my life. Good morning, sir! -Big bros! -King of kings! I stand on one foot for you! [crickets stridulate] [Obinwa] Chief! Chief! How's it going? Ahh! [chuckles] [playful music] [Okonkwo] Very good palm wine! It has fermented perfectly! Take it, take it… Take my hand. Chief! The great warrior, the one who's back, does not know the taste of sand. Nobody can face me. Let anyone come, I'll beat the living spirit out of him. I will beat the spirit out of him. The one who's back does not know the taste of sand. Where will it happen? He will try, let him come. I'll deal with him. -Chief? -Yes? Chief, if you saw them this time… They were many more. [shrieking] Big! Colorful! Beautiful! If you saw how they danced… Hold on, hold on… Did they chase you? [distorted screams] Did they catch you? [inhales sharply] Were you afraid? No. I was not afraid. So what are you talking about? Did you recognize any of them? [chuckles] Can you… Can you even name the names of masquerades we have around here? Can you? This is why I said you're a city boy. I don't blame you. You are born in this new era. Chief, I'm not a city boy. I'm not a city boy! But it's all showing in you. Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid! It's not that I'm afraid. It's just… You don't have to fear them. -Chief? -Yes? Your place of work. What are their plans for you? What do you expect them to say? What do you expect them to do? But is it not in their factory that you got injured? Isn't it their olden days, outdated equipment that wounded you? But as you see it now… They've sacked me. I have been abandoned. What if we go to a hospital? To do what? I mean just to hear what they will say, chief. What they will say? The white man's hospital? -No. -You want to go up to them? No. Not a white man's hospital. It's… just Lagos State Teaching Hospital here. It's still the same question. Western hospital. You want me to go there and then… fool myself around? In our own lineage, we are powerful hunters. Powerful herbalists. Do you understand? An average hunter is able to… get herbs and apply to whatever wound you have. This thing you are seeing here is a small matter. I'll take care of it. -We can even convert wine into herbs. -[Obinwa laughs] It seems you're doubting me. If you doubt me, just pour wine on this wound, and we see what will happen now… It will go. So if I let you, you'll actually pour it? Drink your palm wine. Chief! [both sing] [both laugh] No, no, no. A farm will not work. Farming won't give us anything. Farming makes a lot of sense! I disagree. Do you know what will make the most sense? Spicy Goat Head restaurant. -Spicy Goat Head restaurant! -[both guffaw] I am tired of this city. I'm sick of the city, because everywhere is polluted. It has even affected the spiritual realm and the spirits are losing their powers. Atrocities here and there. Kidnapping, raping and stealing. All this prevents the spirit from manifesting fully. Even our herbs that could cure common sickness. Even a wound like my own. They've all lost their potency. Otherwise why hasn't my leg healed in over three month? Tell me. I'm sick and tired of the city. Do you know what I am going to do? I'm packing out! What do you mean: "pack out"? I'm packing out! I don't understand. What do you mean: "pack out"? That is a topic of conversation for another day. Next time when you have that dream… Let me give you a piece of advice. Any time you see a masquerade approaching, don't run. Stay, and embrace them. Those masquerades, they are our ancestors. They must have something good they want to tell you. For your today and for your tomorrow. So don't run, embrace them. Treat them like our forefathers. I'm sick of this city. I must pack out. I must pack out… You can take permission tomorrow… Permission for what? Will you not follow Okonkwo? -To where? -Obinwa… His people forced him to go for a checkup at the hospital. When they got to the hospital, the doctor said the sore on his leg has rot. The wound has gone completely rotten on that part of the leg. They have to cut it off, quickly. The whole leg, from the knee downward. They can't even afford to go to a government hospital. But there is this man, who said he can treat it…. But he is a veterinarian. He also specializes in traditional medicine. And he said he can treat him. He will meet with him tomorrow. Animal doctor? I'm surprised he didn't tell you. I will pray for him. God will heal him. What's the time? Are you still having that same dream? You were making noise in your sleep. Go and take a bath. And eat, so that you will leave early for work today. Thank you, sir. Sir? I was wondering if I could get an advance. For my next month's salary. Why? It's for medical reasons. What kind of medical reason? Is there something wrong with your private parts? No. How much advance? 50 percent. -Should I wait? -Get out of my sight. There you go. What's this? Tell him to apply it to the wound at morning and night. After a week, the wound should have completely healed. Thanks, Musa! [Obinwa] Okonkwo! [laughs] Are you still sleeping? The great warrior who's back does not know the taste of sand… [dramatic music] [sobbing] My husband. Please. Let us go and see my pastor this weekend. For what? You are still having those nightmares. When did I ever say it was a nightmare? [distorted music] Obinwa? One day… a long time ago… in the village of Awga… a woman went fishing by the river, with her fishing basket. Bringing her basket out of the water, without any fish… Lo and behold! It was the mask of the Okoroshi. She became scared. As the other women in the river were also getting fish… Out of fear she threw the mask back into the water. And went to a different location on the river to continue fishing. She dipped her basket into the water again. Lo and behold! The Okoroshi mask resurfaced. The woman was puzzled and less frightened. She wrapped the mask in cloth and went home. She showed the mask to her husband. And he told her he had seen the exact same mask worn by a dancing masquerade that frequently visits him in his dreams. They decided to go to the local high priest. The high priest then examined the mask, and told them that this is the mighty Okoroshi mask. He told them that whenever Okoroshi comes into town, he would dance for the people. His dance was very beautiful. And everyone who abandoned what they were doing, to come and dance with Okoroshi… They would be filled with joy and happiness. And be blessed with children, good fortunes and wealth. These are some of the good deeds the masquerade brings to society. But there is a greater role this powerful ancestral spirit plays. And that is watching over us. He punishes law offenders and the wicked. Okoroshi is a spirit that brings good fortune to good people. And brings bad luck to the wicked. And that is what makes Okoroshi unique. [Okonkwo saying a chant] [bell ringing] [spirits shouting, bell continues ringing] [suspenseful instrumentals swell] [spirits continue shouting] [thunder sounds] [dramatic music] My God! Blood of Jesus! My God! Raymond! Raymond! My husband! Raymond? Where are you?! [Raymond grunting scared and frustrated] Raymond? Raymond? Do you hear me? Raymond! What is this, Raymond? [Raymond continues grunting] [Nneka wailing] What is this, Raymond? Remove this thing now! Raymond! What the hell is this? Raymond! [screeching] Give me my husband back now! Raymond, where are you? Raymond? My husband? [sniffs] Come, let's go. ["Ride of the Valkyries" by Richard Wagner playing] Please, it's just my husband. It's just a mask, it's just a mask. He's my husband. Make the call and stop behaving like an illiterate. What the hell is this? What the hell is this? This is not a playground! It's Raymond. It's Raymond. [Mr. Osagie] Raymond? Are you in there? Then he should remove the mask now. Please can he come to work like this? Just for this week? Give me back my husband. Please give me back my husband! What did Raymond do to you? Give me Raymond back! My husband! Please… Please, give me my husband. Raymond. Raymond! Raymond! -[Goldie] I thought it would be at night? -[Doris] Why? For obvious reasons, it's night. Are you saying prostitutes can only fuck at night? See, let me break it down for you, from experience. Mornings, and afternoons too, it's safer, most times. Because sometimes, the customer is rushing to go to work. Or they are on break. So they don't really have time to fuck. Most of the time it's either a blow job or a quickie. One! Two! Doris, I'm coming! Let me tell you. This Lagos has become too dangerous for me to hustle at night. I'd rather be at home watching my African magic cable TV. And my customer is here. You won't make heaven, darling. Look who's talking. Sleeping with married men at this hour. Hi, sweetie. [Willy-Willy] Masquerade! Masquerade! Masquerade! Masquerade! You forgot your money. Masquerade? You danced very well. Ha, very well! [Mr. Osagie] Baby… Let's sit down and talk business. Business. Your concept is great. You know? It is wonderful. Great concept. African culture, tradition. I am a traditional man too. -[groans] That was good. -Of course it was. That was good. Looks like you have been practising. Just pay me my money so I can go. Your money, right? How much? Two thousand, right? All we need to do is package it and do good business. Imagine! On a billboard… "Willy-Willy and the Masquerade." We will shake the whole town! We will make lots of money. Looks like I forgot my wallet. -Don't even try and pull a fast one on me! -Stop yelling! That's the same bullshit story you gave me yesterday! -Pay me my money! -I'll pay you tomorrow. Don't you know I pay taxes! Pay me my money or you'll regret it! Are you crazy! Don't let me get wild! I'll go crazy for you! Pay me my money! You don't want to make money? Wait, let's package it! Raymond! [flute playing] What's happened? I can't move! Oh my God! I can't move! Please! Please! Please! [Willy-Willy] Masquerade! [Doris] Who the hell are you? Why did you let that guy get away with my money? Masquerade, you just disappeared! Who the hell is Masquerade? I just want my money. I just want my money! Why would you let him get away like that? He's had sex with me twice now without paying! I don't want any problems, please! [growls] -Masquerade. -[growls] [Doris] I don't want any problems. Just give me my money. Prostitutes pay taxes too. I just want my money. I don't want any problems, please. -[growling] -[upbeat music] Are you guys hungry? My dear? Please return the beer and just get me water. -You don't drink? -Not too often. My name is Doris. What are your names? -I am Willy-Willy. -Willy-Willy? -Yeah. -And him? Him? Just call him Masquerade. [laughs] Like a spirit? What kind of work are you guys into? We are into entertainment. What kind of entertainment? Dancing. And acting too. See? See. This is what I'm talking about. Packaging! Packaging! That is all this thing is all about, packaging. [dramatic music, Willy-Willy chatters in background] [intense techno music] [Willy-Willy] Masquerade! Masquerade! Masquerade! [cockerel crows] Masquerade! Masquerade, good morning! What's up? What's our schedule for the day? Smoke… Masquerade! Masquerade! [patient] And… that was it all week, Doctor. Doctor, the whole week. The same thing, over and over. Hmm, that's interesting. Very interesting. There's a clear progression in the hallucinations. Almost as if-- Doctor. I am saying it. And I'll still say it. -Maybe my wife… or my in-laws did… -Come on. Come on! Doctor… I think I will see my prayer warrior. [doctor] No, no, no, no. Come on, this… Doctor, these Edo people. Don't joke with them. -You see, erm… -They are very spiritual. It's nothing of the sort. Everyone experiences hypnagogia. At varying degrees. What is intriguing here, what the data strongly suggests, is that, erm… With the depth and clarity of the hallucinations… I don't even know if I want to call them hallucinations anymore. There is a deliberateness. A concreteness. A form, even, relative to the immaterial to what you are experiencing in the hypnagogic state. Compare it to other test subjects and you'd realize that there's some sort of cognitive entity. I mean my [chuckles]… my theory… Not to jerk my intellectual self off here, but… my theory, anyway. [patient] Hm. So why don't we meet once more this week? OK. [doctor, audio recorder playback] Mystical mind. With Dr. Mathis from the Institute of African studies in Toronto. [Dr. Mathis] Hello, everyone. -[doctor] So, how was your… -[fasts-forward] [Dr. Mathis] …like in ancient Greek myths? [doctor] Precisely, that's perfectly analogous. The school of thought holds that these entities which we call fictional, mythological, which we dismiss as creative expressions of folklore, -once actually existed and, er… -[fasts-forward] [Dr. Mathis] …or had proxies, like oracles or such. [doctor] …or had proxies. And they had immediate roles to play in traditional African societies, beyond… [fasts-forward] [Dr. Mathis] …functions of many mythical creatures, focuses majorly on entertainment but… [fasts-forward] [doctor] …extents to which orthodox religion changed traditional African society… [fasts-forward] [Dr. Mathis] You are right. That does sound crazy. [doctor] No, no, no. [stammers] But the theory is… There are certain people, certain… individuals, who are like conduits. And what does a conduit do? It attracts. It conducts. So these people have within them or around them, or whatever… a… psychic energy that… and I know you hate that term, Mathis, but… [Dr. Mathis] Not hate. Not hate. Just, erm, wary.

[sighs] [upbeat 8-bit music] [squeals] Babe. What sort of melting bubble gum is this? -Gum is gum. -You are so cheap. I am only concerned about getting a customer right now. We've been standing here chewing gum since morning, no action. And all this, my God… Jesus! Calm down! I know them. How are you guys doing? By the way, do you guys know Don-E? -Who? -He is also into movies and entertainment. What's going on here? Babe, calm down. If you run, he will freeze you. So, how are you guys doing? [growls] This is for you. Thank you! Masquerade, thank you. God bless you. -Thank you! -Do you guys want to go clubbing? There's this club we usually go to. Come on, let's go have a drink. Masquerade! Masquerade! We are coming! [club music] [Don-E] You guys are having fun? Nothing is too much here. Have your drinks, there is more to come. This guy is crazy… And I love craziness. [Don-E] Are you guys dancers? -We are-- -Actors! We are actors. Actually, we are entertainers. We are into entertainment. Anything entertainment. Dancing, acting, singing… That is nice. You see, this is my baby. She's a singer. But she's going to become a star. I am shooting a musical video for her. Crazy song. Crazy video. And I would love him to be in the video, you know? [Willy-Willy] You see… Yeah… Yes, yes, but the problem is… -[Don-E] How much is it? -One million… Two million! [Willy-Willy] Er… It's not a costing thing… issue. Er, it's the… [Don-E] She said two million just now. OK, I will make it two point five. Let me go and ease myself. And my colleague also should… Don't worry. You guys can go. You know? And come back and tell me your final decision. Money is no problem. You know, I was not even thinking big enough. I told you big, big things… big, big things would happen to us. Big, big business. And money will start coming in. [Willy-Willy urinates] You see, Masquerade… Masquerade, in this life loyalty is the most important thing. Loyalty. We need to be loyal to each other. [bell rings] You know? All this time we've been partnering, you tell me, give all the money we make to that useless girl… -Hey, hey! -[growls] [squeaks] He has disappeared again. [biker] She told me to take her to Lekki. Next thing she just appeared with a masquerade. The moment I saw it I took off! -Were you scared of the masquerade? -Of course I was frightened! Beautiful African cultures. This is our heritage. [clicks fingers] Just by creating masquerade costumes, you can create billions of jobs in this country. You see, the man who turned into a masquerade, he lives in my neighborhood. -Really? -Yeah. -May I have a number, please? -How much? [dramatic music] So he's been having this dream for over two months. [doctor] Every day? Sometimes in daytime. Sometimes at night. And I told him: "I don't like this dream." Let's go and see my pastor. But he said no. Can you please… describe the dream? How do you expect me to describe the dream? Was I the one dreaming it? You said he was being chased by… That is what he told me. That's the only thing he told me. That's all he told me. That's all I know. But there was this day… We went to bed, like normal people. As we woke up, he had completely transformed. That's how it happened. Just like that. Did he… Did he always have the masquerade costume in the house? -Did he buy it from somewhere? -No. No. We never kept anything like that in our house. Raymond never had anything like that. As I have said, that is exactly how it happened. We went to bed. And as we woke up… That's how it happened. Just like that. What did you do when you found out? Did you call for help? [flute playing] [all] Wow! [bell rings] -Greetings, IPSSHRR! -We are one! -I salute you all! -Our tradition will live long! Okoroshi. Great Masquerade, Okoroshi. We are happy to have you in our midst today. Welcome. We are… the Igbo People Secret Society for Heritage Restoration and Reclamation. [lion growls] IPSSHRR. [all] Shhh! -Don't tell anyone. -[all] No, no, no. We are dedicated… to restoring the pride and glory of Igbo culture, and putting it where it is supposed to be. So that it is never forgotten. -It will never die. -[everyone murmurs] -It will never die. -[all] It will never die! God will never let it happen. When we found out that there was a masquerade, a great masquerade, dancing in town, shaking things… and then come to find out that that masquerade was no other than the great Okoroshi. The masquerade greater than other masquerades. Greater than spirit, greater than man. We knew that it was a message from our ancestors. That the time has come for us to rise again! This morning… hm? Our ancestors spoke to me. Yes! And they revealed to me that today will mark the beginning of the year of the Okoroshi. You have heard… Great Okoroshi… To demonstrate our deep gratitude for this message that you have brought for us from our ancestors, we have planned a great parade in the city in your honor. But… our vice president… -has not yet arrived from Abuja. -[shouting] -I don't know. Should we wait? -[all] No! -Or should we go? -[all] Yes! Yes! When men have gathered, a kola nut should be broken. Let those who are late manage the pieces. Let us go and celebrate! It's OK, it's OK. OK. Let's go. [eerie music] So when we woke up that morning… my husband transformed into a spirit… a masquerade. I didn't know what I was going to do. So I took him to the hospital. As we reached the hospital, they refused to help us. From there I took him to his office. When we got there, they didn't help us either. In fact, his boss immediately fired him. So, later on, we went back home. When we got home, the spirit…I mean, masquerade… We both sat down. Next thing… it just vanished! It just… disappeared. Just like that. Since that day till now, I haven't seen my husband. That's how my husband disappeared. I haven't seen him till now. [eerie music stops] -[police laugh] -Did you guys hear that story? What a story. [Nneka] Officer, it's true. That's exactly how it happened. In what reality does a husband wake up transformed into a spirit? But that is what happened! Why are you guys laughing at me? [tribal music] [Musa] You know, Raymond Obinwa is a very African traditional man. Like all these kind of things… And… I suspect he did some juju. Sorry? Hello, sir! I just need a few minutes of your time. I just want to ask you a few questions about the… It's just five minutes, please. Just five minutes. Ehm, it's about the masquerade. I want to know your experience. I don't know anything about any masquerade. Musa, please get rid of this man! I don't know anything about any masquerade. [doctor] I didn't mean to cause any trouble. Come, come, come. That masquerade is the son of the devil! Son of the devil! Say what? -O… -O-ko-ro-shi. Oh. O-ko-ro-chi? "Okorochi." Hmm… He was great entertainer. Great entertainer! And he also believed in justice. I remember one time he and I were walking. He caught this crook stealing. He beat the living daylight out of him! Jagar! Jagar! I can't lie to you! I swear on my mother! I swear on my father! I can't lie to you! A monster? It wasn't really a monster. It was more like a masquerade. It had supernatural powers. It definitely didn't behave like a human being. It moved like a spirit. What fucking spirit? Fuck that spirit! Fuck anything fuckable about that spirit! All I want is my fucking money! Aren't you a man? -I'm a man! -So why? It disappeared! It disappeared! It froze me! I was trying to move, but I couldn't! Then It started to whip me! Me! I don't know where Doris found those characters. [laughs] I didn't actually find them. They just appeared out of nowhere, hm? But they were nice to me. -Nice? -Mm-hm. [chuckles] Those guys are strange! I don't really know about that, but the masquerade really helped me. He was really nice to me, so… Mm-hm. [intense music] [bell rings] [clears throat] Hey! -Greetings, my brothers! Greetings -We are one! We are one! I salute my Igbo brothers! Our tradition will live forever! Hey! Okoroshi! Mighty masquerade! When the mighty masquerade comes out… the whole town is electrified. -Yes! Yes! Yes! Okoroshi -[cheering] Greater than spirit, greater than man. Allow me to introduce myself. I am also the vice president of IPSSHRR! [all] IPSSHRR! Okoroshi! I salute you. My brothers, you did great. Sorry I wasn't present. I was held up in Abuja. You know, meeting president and politicians. I heard and I was filled with joy, I was dancing. I heard that you people took the great masquerade Okoroshi out. And they were dancing and rejoicing! Yes, that is what we are supposed to do. So that they will know that the time of IPSSHRR is here now! -My people! -[all] We are one! OK now… Standing on all protocols duly observed and moving on to the next course of action. Our brothers in Enugu, headquarters, they have sent me here. And they have given me the order that the great masquerade Okoroshi will be taken to the east, so that every necessary plan and preparation -will take place at the headquarters. -[murmured agreement] Calm down! Calm down! Calm down, I am still speaking. Shut up! I am still speaking. Ah! There is a saying: "When the ancestors call, we answer them immediately," is that not so? What we know, is that the great Okoroshi and our ancestors all came from the east. So therefore, let the masquerade return to the east. [scoffs] Honorable… Honorable! I salute you. This way you came in, we knew it was going to be an intense meeting. -[vice president] For sure. -Hm… [tuts] But, erm… Hm. We are considering that… that the great Okoroshi… will remain with us here in Lagos. -[all] Ohh! Oh! -Mm! That way, we can be communicating back and forth with Abuja. And carrying out all the wishes. From here. The crown belongs to the head and not the stomach. Now the head is itching for the crown. So therefore, let the masquerade return to the east! [jeering] Hm. Honorable, please don't be upset. But if the ancestors, our great ancestors, decided that Okoroshi appear in Lagos, is it not a clear sign that the masquerade should reside here? -Exactly! -Eh? Let the masquerade remain here. You? Is that coming from you? How can you utter such words? Abomination! Elder Nwankwo! Since when have we been asking questions of the ancestral spirits? -Is that possible? -No! Good, so we are on the same page. The only thing we can be sure of is that the great spirit of Okoroshi belongs to the Igbo land. So therefore, let the masquerade return to the east! No! My brothers, listen to me! Any tribe, or clan, or ethnic group, or any country, even America, the country of the white men, cannot exist without its people. Am I lying? Therefore… any land where a whole community of Igbo people have gathered, is Igbo land. Therefore, chief, let the masquerade remain here! -[cheers] -Take it easy! Quiet! Take it easy, take it easy. Look, I have not come here for any political and geographical story. I have come here with a short and simple order. They gave me a mandate to tell you that the great masquerade Okoroshi belongs to the Igbo land. So therefore, let the masquerade return to the east! -[clamoring] -[member] Wait! Wait! So what about us? Will we not take part in anything to do with Okoroshi? -Ahh… Ah! -How fair is that? When we are the ones the masquerade came to? OK. Let me tell you something. If the masquerade is to stay here what of our brothers and sisters in different parts of the country? Those ones in the southeast, southwest and in the north? What do they do? We have a solution. That is why I have set up a social media arrangement. Elder Nwankwo? You sent me a message through WhatsApp. On my birthday you wished me a happy birthday on Facebook. Aren't you all on Instagram? Aren't you all on Twitter? There are arrangements for Okoroshi to be on social media. You follow him there! And for those of you who know that you want to be physically present, or involved physically, then all of you should move to the east. [member one] You expect me to shut down my business and move to the east? Yes! [member two] What about me? Do you know how long I have lived in Lagos? [member three] What about some of us who are married to Yoruba? -You will come with her! -[member 4] You think it's easy to move? Bring her! Come to the east, there is space. Our people say: "Whenever a bird flies always from its mother's nest, there must be a worm that will bring it back to that nest." Please! Please! Please! Forget all these Pete Edochie proverbs. This is not a Nollywood home video! What I want to know is… what exactly is the plan for our brothers in the headquarters, for Okoroshi! [member] Tell us! When you are having your executive meetings, do you invite junior members? [clamoring] [everyone shouts] [steady techno music] [everyone hums] [flute playing] [moaning] [synth music] [synth music fades out] [dramatic music] Hello, Nneka? Yes, I think I know where your husband is. Jagar! What the hell is wrong with you? Jagar! Jagar! He's outside. That masquerade that stole your money! [synth music] [Jagar] Hey! You masquerade! Come here! [distorted music] Look at this one! They call you Okoroshi or whatever! You want to freeze me! You! The gods of the underworld have bathed me! I am Jagar! [screeching] Huh! [distorted music fades out] [silence] [synth music fades in] [Nneka cries] [upbeat music] [interviewer] Sir, thank you for inviting us here today. Thank you for having us. We appreciate this so much. May I begin? Please. You have been doing extensive research on the relationship between the spiritual and the physical. Can you kindly tell us some of your findings? Well, as elements of the spirit worlds materialise in the physical world they become distorted by the chaos of urban Nigerian life. Ah. How so? Because certain energies of the spirit worlds match with certain energies of the physical world, disruptions in the physical can cause corruptions in how the spiritual manifest materially. The spiritual-cultural displacement that Nigeria is going through. And we are even stuck there… Yes. It has created an imbalance in the general Nigerian consciousness. And it naturally trickles down into daily living. It's something we desperately need to sort out. Now, there have been some positive findings in this area, right? I mean, take for instance your own very book: "The revival of traditional African spiritual archetypes." It's your book, you wrote it? In this very book, you posit that there have been conscious and unconscious efforts to bring a balance into this… Yeah, indeed. The response to cultural displacement is replacement. And, like you said, there have been conscious and unconscious efforts to bring us back to our intrinsic spirituality, in a way that is symbiotic with our socio-cultural realities. You see people returning to lost traditional practices, you see corporate Nigeria seeking an identity of African corporateness in things as little as trading the suits for agbadas and bubas. Sir, let me just stop you there. This very tie is Adire! Yes! You see more people returning to traditional religions. There is a lot of haphazardness about it, but things are being done in that regard. And we're positive for more. Actually sir, this haphazardness that you say you have observed in your findings… Take for example Raymond Obinwa. That is the imbalance! You see, when the spiritual tries to materialise in the physical, the corruptions show up as imbalanced psycho-spiritual states. And this is a global phenomenon, mind you, it's not just in Nigeria or Africa. Yes. If you look to the United States, for instance. Incidents like the Slender Man stabbings, the Son of Sam murders, Richard Ramirez…. All these are indicative of altered and imbalanced psycho-spiritual states. Of a displaced spiritual psychological collective. What is most captivating and intriguing about Raymond Obinwa is that the individual experienced complete transmogrification to the extent that you begin to wonder… the extent that the physical and the spiritual really operate? There's still work to be done, but I believe we're in the right direction. Wow, wow, wow. [whispers] Wow. [doctor] If there's one thing I can tell you, the case of Raymond Obinwa will not be the last of its kind. [cackles] [drumming music] [pants] [end credits music]
