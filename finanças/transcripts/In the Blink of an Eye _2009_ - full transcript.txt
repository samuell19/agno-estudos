God, please help me. Please, please help me, God. [car approaching] Help, help! Shut up! Uh! Stop! Ahh! Apparently, this girl, Lindsey, is some kind of a pop star, calling her ?The sensation of the new millennium.? Would you please not surf the web while you're driving? You and that phone. Dude, I was going 4 miles an hour. Well, yeah, it's a bad habit, all right? All I'm saying is this girl wrote a song called ?Sugar Baby? that made her more money than you and I will make in our entire lifetimes. We chose the wrong careers, brother. Yeah, except for the fact that she could be tied up somewhere out here in a trailer. That's a good point. Think she's still alive? Gotta have faith, man. Really? Do you have to bring God into every conversation? Look, all I'm saying is when there ain't no hope, sometimes a little prayer can do a lot of good. Yeah well, I just hope this lead pans out and we find her before it's too late. Hey, you think if we save her they'll put us on the cover of ?Us Weekly?? It seems only fair. I'm going to take the back. Let's see what we see. [twig snaps] [music] Oh! You're trespassin', boy! Oh! Huh? Who are you, huh? David! David! [gun firing] You okay, man? Uh, never better. Ah. Are you prayin'? Yeah, I don't get shot with my own gun. Perp took it. Well, in that case, we should definitely wait for backup. [woman crying] I guess we're not waiting. [gun fires] Hang on,brother, hang on! [woman crying] Shut up! Hold it,you! I'll kill her. I'll kill her now. Just calm down,man. Drop the gun. Look,you don't want to shoot her and I know you don't want me to shoot you. Drop it. Calm down. I'm going to count to three. Not happenin', man. One! Two- [gun fires] Where did he hit you, man? You all right? Oh. You all right, you all right? Where'd he hit you at? In the cell-- [woman crying] In the what? The cell phone, man. Me and my phone. [laughing] It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. Pretty amazing that all you come away with is a couple of bruised ribs. No, I call it a miracle. Look, I'm sorry, man. This guy takes a straight shot for your heart and shoots your cell phone instead. I'm just saying. I'm going to see how the girl's doing. I'm going to check on my boys. You know what I'd call a miracle? God just struck the guy down before he ever got his hands on the girl. The two of you have to do that right now? Can't you see you're embarrassing the EMT? You about done with him, son? Uh, yeah. Good deal. So, how serious is it? You able to fill out a report on this tonight? Yeah, I'm fine. I've got prescription stuff back at the house. I gotta tell you. I'm not too thrilled about the perp winding up dead with your gun. Told ya. Neither was i. You should've called for backup. You don't get into a shootout with a crazy guy. You're lucky both of you didn't get killed. I feel lucky. [laughing] Fill out your paperwork. Go home and kiss your wives, get some sleep. You did good work saving that girl tonight, both of you. Thanks, captain. Oh boy, this oughta be good. I've been trying to nail this guy for years. Are you okay, baby? Yeah. So you're the heroes who rescued my Lindsey. Thank you both. Captain Jones, how are things? Just livin' the dream, Kevin. Glad to hear it. So, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to get her home. I'm taking her to Mexico on my yacht for the weekend so she can rest up. A yacht? Now, that's impressive. Thanks again, detectives. If there's ever anything I can do for you guys, please don't hesitate, right? Actually, I've never been on a yacht. Me neither. Ah...ah...okay...all right. Yeah, okay, why don't you guys come along then? Bring your wives, your girlfriends, your dogs or whatever you got. It'll be fun. You sure? I'll have my plane pick you up on Thursday, all right? Thank you guys so much. What are you doin'? What? The guy invited us. Might as well see if we can find out something for ya. And by the way, this doesn't count for vacation days. [laughing] # I'll be your sugar baby # I'll be your ice cream # # I'll be your sugar baby # show me the limousine # # take me around the world # give me the diamonds # # and pearls # I'll be your sugar baby # # you'll be my money machine # if you wanna buy me # # a bracelet # if you wanna buy me a lake # # one that has a really big # house on it # Thank you. Hey! Welcome, welcome. I'm Ethan. David, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. And this is my wife, Lori. Lori, nice--you must be Larry. This is my wife, Suzette. Hi. Nice to meet you. Kevin apologizes. He couldn't be here. He's actually down in Mexico right now preparing the boat. Follow me. This is our chariot. And we're off. I'll be your sugar baby # # I'll be your ice cream # I'll be your-- # Ah, this is why I love my job. you'll be my money machine # # [music] I'm pretty sure you're the first cops we've ever had onboard. I have to see if you've had to arrest any of the rap stars he's ever worked with. [laughing] Here she is. Welcome to paradise. I'm going to leave you with captain brown. I'll go take care of your luggage. Thank you. I'm captain brown. Welcome aboard. Nice to meet you. Please follow me. Your quarters. Wow. I wish I had this much room in my bedroom at home. All this from selling a few tunes, huh? He's got it good here. Get yourself settled. If you need anything, just give me or Ethan a call. Thank you. Thanks. We'll see you topside. That looks bad. Ah, it's okay. [music] What do you think? I was just thinking what it would be like to not be part of the rat race. You'd be lost. Maybe. But I wouldn't mind spending more time like this together. Me too. Hola, amigos. Welcome to Mexico. Any illegal contraband you may find onboard is not mine. But then again, you're not on duty, right? You must be-- Lori. Kevin, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. This is Lindsey, the damsel in distress. Hi. Nice to meet you. Pleasure. Why don't you guys grab yourselves a drink? I'm going to go downstairs and get dinner ready. Thank you. That means he's going to go heat up the dishes the caterer made for him. It's a really beautiful boat. Lori is a big fan of your song, ?Sugar Baby.? [laughing] Thank you. I'm glad you two could come down. I'm glad to be here. You all right? I'm all right. It shakes you up a little when you come that close to dying, but l guess you know that. Yeah. It's just got me thinking. I want--I want you to know you didn't risk your life on me for nothing. Thank you again. You're welcome. Looks like you got a fan now. Well, it's nice to be appreciated. [music] So Kevin, have you produced any Gospel records? Not exactly my style. No, we're more urban poetry. Rap. You say that like it's a dirty word. Must be the people we met who listen to it. I don't think you can blame violence on rap music. No. Look at Iran. They don't even have rap music. That's only 'cause it's hard to find words that rhyme with ?Death to America? or ?Death to Israel.? don't get me started on Iran. It's frightening to think of that government getting nuclear missiles. What about Israel? They are the loose cannons. I bet you sometime soon they're going to try and fly in and take out every nuke site in Iran they can. Either way, I think Iran is spoiling for a war that's going to destabilize the middle east. I mean, and they don't care how many people will die as long as they can lead the Arab nation in getting rid of the big satan and little satan. [cell phone buzzing] We're supposed to be on vacation. I know, I know, I'm sorry. Sorry, guys, it's just-- excuse me. I agree with Kevin. No look, isolating ourselves from world affairs is exactly-- Hey captain, what's up? Having fun? Here's everything we got. Thanks. I found something of interest in the computer of that perp you shot, Max West. A picture on his hard drive taken at a party shows him standing next to your host down there. What do you think? Kevin knows this guy? I'll e-mail you a copy of the photo. You ask him about it. Watch his reaction. Okay, will do. Good deal. Hey. Captain just wants to know how it was. And how are you? [sighing] Same David, different sea of life. What? For some reason, I was hoping this trip would be different. Lori, it was one phone call. Of course it was. It's always one something. I thought you'd be happy to spend a weekend together on a boat. Stop punishing me for doing my job. I have to work. That's the whole point, David. This wasn't supposed to be work. If we're going to be together, then be here with me. When you're on the phone, it doesn't feel like we're together. Unbelievable. You always have to find one thing that I didn't do right. Why bother to come? What do you--what do you want me to do? That should tell you there's a problem. Can I get you two anything? No, thanks. Sorry, man. They found a photo in the home of Max West, Lindsey s abductor. It's of you and him together at some event. Do you know him? Do I need a lawyer? Just answer the question. Oh, he's not somebody I knew, that's for sure. You have to realize there's a lot of hangers-on around the edge of the music scene. They're drawn to the glitz and the glamour. So he was just staking out the right opportunity. It must've been that. There's definitely something off with this guy. Okay, there's not much we can do right now. Just let the captain check into it and keep our eyes open. But in the meantime, my friend, you could put your focus into trying to take that unhappy look off Lori's face. I'm trying. I've been trying for years. I just don't have a handle on how to do it. I just don't have a handle on how to do it. Lori, you cannot force David to change. You can only work on your own heart and pray for him. Pray? Mm-hmm. And work on accepting God's love and plan for your life. To be honest, I don't even think I know what that means. You know, God loves you so much that he sent his son to die for your sins. What sins? I haven't really done anything that bad. Well, first thing to realize is we were born in sin, all of us. The very nature of the human race is sinful because sin entered the world through Adam and Eve in the garden. In Corinthians, in the Bible, it says, ?For since death comes through a man, the resurrection of the dead also comes through man. For as in Adam, all die. So in Christ, all will be made alive.? I got to tell you, Dave. We've been partners for 5 years. Okay, and you're just as unhappy right now as you were the day we met. Well, it's part of my charm. Do you believe in the big bang theory? Please, not tonight. No, come on, I'm serious. Do you believe in the big bang theory? Yeah. I believe in something called the ?Big Bam? theory, okay? God spoke the word, bam! The heavens and the earth were formed. Seriously? You've like told that joke like four times. It's not a joke, brother. Whatever. My point is, all right, is that you could be part of it all. Take it from someone who's been exactly where you are right now. You know, it's because you don't know God that you have all this emptiness and lack of peace in your life. Wow, thanks for cheering me up. So, what are we supposed to do? Are we just all headed to hell? You know, the good news is in john 3: l6, it says that ?God sent his only begotten son to die on the cross for us.? and if we believe in our hearts and ask for forgiveness and confess with our mouth that Jesus is Lord, then we will be saved. So that's what being saved means? Mm-hmm. Is putting my faith and trust in Jesus. That's it, and surrendering your life to him. And then, Lori, every day, every situation, you look to him for guidance. And by following his words laid out in the Bible, he will change your life and give you hope and a peace you never knew existed. I want that. I want Jesus in my life. Let's pray. [sniffling] Lord Jesus, I need you in my life. I desire to have the peace that Suzette has. Thank you for dying on the cross for me. Forgive me of my sins. And I promise to serve you as my Lord and my savior. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Lord. No offense, but I think I prefer our time together when we're being shot at by crazy people. [laughing] Are you going to go? Salvation is a choice, David. All right? And when you're ready to make that choice, I guarantee I'll be right there with you. You're relentless, man. I'm going to bed. I hate checkers. I must be getting' to you, brother. You got the tattoo of that cross on your arm there. It's a dagger. I keep telling you it's a dagger. Whatever you say. Good night! [music] David. David! David? Morning. Hmm. You don't want to sleep away your first day on vacation, do you? Come on. Get up. I mean it. I'm up, I'm up. Oh! I thought you said no work. It's my morning journal. Suzette suggested I write my experiences in it. Plus, I want to remember everything on this vacation. All right then, that's allowed. Thanks. I'll see you out there. [cell phone ringing] Hello? Havin' fun? Hey, captain. Yeah, I showed him that photo. He gave me some vague answer. You're right. This guy's dirty. And yet he's got no criminal records, not here at least. I'm checking with interpol. In the meantime, do me a favor. Try enjoying yourself on vacation. I told you, it's not a vacation. Whatever. [music] Look what Kevin made for us. Ah, cool. You guys want to go to bird island with us? See some cool seals and take some pics? Apparently my wife wants to take me some place alone. All right then. You guys have a good time. All right, see you guys. B ye! [music] It's a great day! # Great day! # [music] Open up your eyes! # Open up your eyes! # What's gotten into you? For me to know and you to find out. That's how it's going to be, huh? [laughing] I gotcha. Oh! Ow. [laughing] I love you. I love you too. Hungry? What have you got? Turkey or ham. They both sound good. Let's go with ham. Come on. Let's go play. I think I'm just going to relax a little. Okay. You relax, and I'm going to go find some seashells to take home. Okay, pretty girl. [music] [alarm beeping] [thunder crashes] Lori? Lori? Lori! I can't believe I forgot my phone. Lori! Lori! Lori! Lori! There you are. Have you seen, Lori? No. We need to call the local police. We can't. There's no signal. The ship-to-shore's down too, just static. What happened? Where's Lori? She's gone. What do you mean gone? I mean gone. I fell asleep on the beach and when I woke up, she was missing. Larry and his wife are missing too. What? We were on bird island. They went off to take some pictures. All of a sudden there was this weird, ground-shaking earthquake and like a bright flash of light. So, I go out to check on 'em, make sure they're all right and there's nothing. Look, I was with the boat the entire time, listening to some of Kevin's new tunes. I searched the entire island, man. It's like they just took off. It's a popular tourist spot. They could've gotten on another boat there. But why? You think the three of them went off somewhere? Lori's wave runner is still at the beach. They could've picked her up on a boat. That doesn't make any sense. She was in the water. Maybe she got caught in a riptide. Look, I don't know. We just need to call the Mexican navy. We can't. I told you. The radio doesn't work. Maybe they planned this out before for some reason, for the three of them to take off together and not take you. What's that supposed to mean? It's your wife, your friends. Did you do something that would make 'em want to leave? No. That's the only answer. Three of them all run off together. Unless it's just supposed to look like they ran off together. What are you trying to say? Well, say they didn't run off together. Can you think of any reason someone would kidnap the three of them and leave you all alone out there on the beach? You did have a nasty argument with your wife the other day. Look, we're wasting time. We need to try to call the police and the navy again. [music] What are you doing? Looking for anything out of the ordinary, a map, travel brochure, phone number. Hey, you could be destroying evidence. If I planned something out, I wouldn't have left any evidence. That's right. You're a homicide detective, aren't you? You know, maybe you should be letting us do the searching. This is my boat. I'm responsible for whatever happens on it. I'm in charge. Then do something! I told them I think they're crazy. You don't see me masterminding any murders. Maybe if it was captain Gary s. None of this makes any sense. I mean, if they wanted to run away from me, why not take the things that they needed like money or an id? And there's no way Larry'd leave this behind. I thought I made it clear. Yeah, yeah. What are you doing? Amelia rose to shore. This is the Amelia rose to shore, anyone copy? Amelia rose to shore. This is the Amelia rose trying to reach anyone on shore, do you copy? Anything? Still nothing. [screaming] Help! Help! My friend just disappeared. Help! Is anybody out there? Come help me! What is going on? [music] What is it? Is it because of me? You relax, and I'm going to go find some seashells to take home. You guys want to go to bird island with us and see some cool seals and take some pics? What's gotten into you? For me to know and you to find out. I love you. I love you too. [Lori laughing] David. David. David. Morning. Hmm? You don't want to sleep away your first day on vacation, do you? Come on. Get up. Come on, get up. I'm up, I'm up. Hey, what are you doin'? It's my morning journal. Suzette suggested I write my experiences in it. Plus, I want to remember everything on this vacation. Okay, I guess that's allowed. How'd you sleep? What? I'm asking how was your night? You were asleep when I came to the cabin. Oh, I had some weird dream that wrecked my night. What was it about? We were having a picnic on the beach together, having a great time, and then it was like you just vanished and I couldn't find you. Oh. Did you miss me? Yeah. Yeah, I did. Honey, I'm sorry for being so cold lately. It just feels like I'm losing you and it scares me. So, you know, I put up a wall. But I want us to start over. Forgive me? Yeah. Grab your stuff and meet me on the deck. Okay. [phone ringing] Hello? Having fun? Let me guess. You're checking with interpol on Kevin. Uh...yeah, exactly. What are you psychic now? In the meantime, try something new. Try enjoying yourself on vacation. Yeah right. I'll be your sugar baby # # I'll be your ice cream # I'll be your sugar baby # # show me the limousine # take me around the world # # give me the diamonds # and pearls # # I'll be your sugar baby # you'll be my money machine # # Is that for us? Oh...um...Lori said she wanted it to be a surprise. I-- turkey and ham sandwiches with, what was it, dijon mayonnaise? Yeah. Well, she didn't ask for turkey-- She didn't mention any particular place she was headed, did she? Gary told her which beaches were the most secluded around here. Thanks. They'll love it. I mean, this place is totally awesome. Seals flock to it, dolphins. It's unbelievable. You're going to stick pretty close to Larry and Suzette though, right? More on the island, but make sure they don't get lost. It's not that big a place. But in case of an accident, you want to be nearby, not just hanging out by the launch. Chill, dude. Just keep a close eye on 'em for me, all right? Relax. Relax. You're on vacation. Mornin'. Dry, sunny day, cool ocean breeze, gotta give God thanks for a day like this, man. You never know when you might not see another one, do you? No, you don't. Look what Kevin made for us. That's great. You guys want to go to bird island with us to see some cool seals and take some pics? Apparently my wife wants to take me some place alone. All right then. You guys have a good time. [music] What's the matter with the other beach? I like this one better. It's more secluded. Okay. Pick a spot. I'll get the basket. You want to go swimming? My ribs are bothering me. Are you hungry? Maybe later. You're looking at it like it's poisoned. Are you okay? Are your pills-- I'm fine. We've got all day, right? You don't have to be anywhere, do you? David, come on. Relax. I'm sorry. I guess coming down here got me thinking. I know you're unhappy. Have you ever thought about just leaving me? What? Just taking off? Running away? No. Where is this coming from? Is there something you want to tell me, Lori? Yeah, but not right now. I mean I want to share something really important with you. Is there someone else? Yeah. Not like that. I knew it. Is this your idea of a romantic weekend? David, I love you. But you need to change. We need to change. Is that what you were talking to Suzette about, my need to change? Is that it? No other reason for her little secret smile about you wanting to get me somewhere alone? Answer me. I thought we needed some alone time, to be romantic together, to talk. Talk about what? About life. About us. About God. Oh, don't tell me they're getting to you, Lori. What are you talking about? [phone ringing] You're not going to take that. Hey captain, what's up? Interpol just e-mailed me. Your host has never been charged anything, but he pals around with some pretty heavy hitters. Interpol suspects he's using his music biz to launder money for him. And that boat captain, he has a record in Italy for kidnapping. That fit in with anything you picked up on? I don't know. Look, I gotta go. All right, get back to me. Honey! Honey! Lori! [music] Lori! Lori! [music] Lori! Lori! [alarm beeping] [thunder crashes] Lori! Lori! Oh please, not again. Lori! Lori! [music] Kevin! I need you to radio Ethan. For what? I need to speak to Larry right away. It's a police matter. Yeah, sure. Amelia rose to Ethan. Amelia rose to Ethan. Amelia rose to Ethan. Do you copy? [static sounding] Nothing. You got a gun onboard? Yes. Get it. Nobody on this boat touches that weapon. I don't care if you are a police officer. I have my own gun. I just want to make sure no one uses yours. Kevin, did you know that Gary has a criminal record and one of his convictions is for kidnapping? Gary, you bad boy. Well, I guess that is why I hired you. You know? My girlfriend just got kidnapped. If I wanted to keep that from happening again, I thought I'd hire an expert. That explains why your boat's down here and not in L.A. You've got a captain with an interpol record. You really are a detective, aren't ya? Weird friends you've got there. Just try the radio. Anyone out there? It's the Amelia rose, copy? There's six people dying, and I think it was a nuke-- Amelia rose to anybody, do you copy? Can anyone help? Oh God, help me! Is there anybody out there? Is there anybody out there? Help! Help! I've never seen anything like this. There's smoke everywhere. People are walking around aimlessly about. The end of the world, the end of the world is here. So, what are you going to do? Wait. Wait 'til Ethan gets back. Do you believe in like a deja vu dream, one so real there's no way that it could be a dream? Yeah. I saw something like that once where you dream about the future, but you can't always remember what happens. Dreams of mystery, I think. More like a nightmare. You okay? I don't know. He's back! What happened? Where's the others? Look, i've been trying to get ahold of you but the radio's--we were on bird island. They went off to take some pictures, and they never came back. You didn't see any sign of Lori, did you? No, why? You think the three of them could've gone off some place? Yeah, what's going on? Lori's missing too. Okay, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait. I know you told me to keep a close eye on 'em and I didn't. I'm sorry. But I had nothing to do with any of this. Why did you tell him that? They'd never been there before. I didn't want them getting lost. Yeah, but like I told ya, it's not that big a place. This sounds like you expected something to happen. Are you sure the three of them didn't plan this out for some reason, to go off together and not take you? Did you do something that would make 'em want to leave you behind? No. You and your wife were having a pretty nasty argument the other night. I mean, if this has been going on for a while, maybe you blew your top, maybe they took off because they didn't like ya. I don't know. No, this hasn't been going on for a while. We're not having any big arguments. Maybe you just think it's not big. Maybe you being a cop, you get used to so much violence all the time. Maybe you lose your temper one time too often, make the three of them decide that they've got to get her away from you. All right, we're not going through this again. What do you mean again? I mean, how far is it to bird island? What, 45 minutes? More than that. Okay, Lori and I went in the opposite direction. So, there's no way that l could've gotten to bird island and back to the boat by the time I did. Sounds like you came with an answer all prepared. It does seem suspicious. You know what I think is suspicious? Larry and Suzette go off on your launch and disappear. My wife disappears off of your yacht. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you surrounding yourself with less than perfect employees. I'm talking about your connection with the guy who attacked Lindsey. You knew him? He doesn't know what he's talking about. Maybe the attack on Lindsey and Lori and the others gone missing is all related to you. That's enough. It's not enough! Hey! Stop it! Get off my boat! I'm not going anywhere, not 'til I get the Mexican navy or the police or whoever it takes to ind my wife. I've done this before. There's nothing here. What you said about him knowing, what? I got a photo of them together. Whatever I can do to help. I can't believe this is happening again. Is there any place on this yacht that Lori could be at? Engine room, bridge, I don't-- keep your eyes open, and don't trust anybody but yourself. You okay? Yeah. This is Amelia rose, come in. This is Amelia rose, come in. Is there anyone out there? Mayday! Mayday! This is the Amelia rose, come in. Mayday! Mayday! Come in. Hello, is anyone out there? I think it was nukes. I don't know what happened, please! Help me! Can anyone help? Oh God! [whack!] David. David. David. Morning. You don't want to sleep away your first day on vacation, do you? What happened to you yesterday? You and Larry and Suzette, you-- you have no idea what I'm talking about, do you? No. You and them, together, taking off, disappearing. Whatever. Okay, I'll bite. What are you talking about? I got a story for you. And then, this time, I hit the water and when I woke up, I was in bed again. Well, say something. David, honey, I mean I don't know what to say with the pills and that stress that you're under. All right, look, I'll prove it. What are you doing? [phone ringing] Hello? Having fun? Captain, you're about to tell me that you're checking with interpol, right? Yeah, exactly. But in the meantime, try something new. Try enjoying yourself on vacation. I'll be your sugar baby # # I'll be your ice cream # I'll be your sugar baby # # show me the limousine # take me around the world # # give me the diamonds # and pearls # # I'll be your sugar baby # Turkey and ham sandwiches with dijon mayonnaise. Yeah. A bottle of perrier with peach flavor. That's--how did you know? Thanks. See ya. You guys want to go to bird island with us to see some cool seals and take some pics? Actually, could you do it tomorrow? I was hoping the four of us could go to the beach together today. Yeah, that's fine. Uh, yeah, sure. I guess so if it's important to you. It is. [music] Hey, honey, I'm sorry I keep leaving you in your dreams. [laughing] You know I'm not going anywhere, right? Yeah. Suzette and I spent some time last night and she showed me some amazing things. I want to tell you all about it. I want to hear about it. I need to talk to Larry first. You mind? Okay. Thanks. Come on. You thought we were involved-i got to tell you, man, this is really hard to believe. But think about it. Kevin knew Max, and I think he was responsible for Lindsey s kidnapping. And Gary's an ex-con who was also convicted of kidnapping. Okay, let's just say that this is all part of Kevin's plan. But why would Kevin orchestrate Lindsey s kidnapping? It seems like he loves her. And why would he want to hurt me or Larry and Suzette? I don't know. None of it makes any sense. Guys, thanks for not doing police work here. [laughing] Lori, let's go. And don't worry, David, it's a private island. I promise we won't vanish. We'll be fine. Bye-bye, baby. [laughing] Maybe what you're seeing is portions of events to come. Deja vu? Sort of, you know, but maybe a little different. Maybe God? Okay, stop, stop. Hold on now. Hear me out, okay? There's got to be some reason. God has to have a reason for you to see these dreams. Have you ever heard of the rapture? No. I'm reading this book right now. It's written by a pastor by the name of John Hagee. And in the book, he talks about how we're living in the final seconds of time. What does that mean? Well, since l948, several prophecies have come to pass. l948? That was the year that Israel became a nation again, which was prophesied in the book of Daniel. So, what's so special about that? What other civilization has become a state of a nation again after being destroyed and divided like Israel? I don't know. None, not a one. So, what does this prove? Well, in itself, nothing. But when you couple it with prophecies and fulfillments from the Bible, it signals the return of Christ. Wait, wait, wait. I think I remember hearing you say something about this, returning for his children? That's right. Okay, but what does that have to do with this? Everything, man. Look, Jesus will return someday just as promised. And he will come for his children who loved him truly and followed him in faith that he was the savior. Let's say someone takes a bullet for you. All right now, you've never met them. All right, but they died in order for you to live. Every time you see another sunrise or spend some time with your family, you're going to think about them. You'll remember them, and you'll be thankful for what you have. And that's what it's like when you give your life to Christ. He died in order for you to live. But not just for life, for eternity. I just--I'm sorry, Larry. I just--something doesn't feel right. We need to get back to the boat. Lori! Lori! Honey, we gotta go. Go? Go where? We gotta go right now. What? Come on. We gotta go now. Ow. Come on. [music] Lori. Lori! Stop it. What's the matter with you? I'm sorry. Larry says he feels like God has a purpose for this happening. Now, I don't know if I'm crazy. I don't know if I'm having a nervous breakdown. But if he's right and God has some kind of a hand in this, then I need some help to figure it out. David, you can't just figure out God's plan. You have to open yourself up to him and let it come to you. [phone ringing] You haven't found out anything. You're checking with interpol. I'll talk to you later. Honey? Okay. Stop! Just wait. You need help, David, the kind I can't give you. If you put some faith in God, maybe you wouldn't be taking pills and be stressed out all the time. What are you talking about? Maybe you'd stop shutting me out. Lori, just hear me out. What am I supposed to think? You're telling me you're trapped in a dream? It's like it's some kind of subconscious wish to get rid of me or have me out of your life. Lori, I love you. I'm just trying to make sense of this. Do you think that I want this? I don't want this. Before we came here, I had enough trouble trying to figure out how you felt about me. And now, you have fantasies of me disappearing? I love you, all right? I just need your help. Don't, David. You're scaring me. Babe! Honey! Just stop. Lori! Lori! Go away, David. I just need some time alone. Oh great. Just what I need, an audience. Wait a minute. Honey? You need help, honey? What? Just open the door. All right, it's not that bad. We'll get a doctor for you. Hey, everything okay? It's nothing to be ashamed of, hon. What are you talking about? What's going on? Oh, Lori's sick. She won't let me in. Lori! David, who's out there? What's wrong with her? Oh, she had some adverse reaction to the seasickness pills and it just-- I don't know. It flipped her out. Lori! Lori, you okay? Lori, open the door. There's something wrong with David. He's acting weird He's scaring me. See what I'm saying. She's sick. You saw the way she came in. Look, maybe Suzette can help. Can you help find Suzette? Yeah, sure. What about the captain? Does he have the master key? I'll find out. Come on. Talk to me. Okay, what's wrong? Do I seem crazy to you? Always, but I'm talking about here. What's going on here? I think I found God. That's not something to joke about, David. No, no, no, I know, I know. But all this talk about God, l think I finally figured it out. I think that he has some kind of a plan for me. I think that he wants me to do something. I know that sounds crazy coming from me, but I--I got an idea. I was wondering where you guys went. Not half as much as I have. Is Lori sick? Suzette's here. Just let her in for a second, okay? I'll stay outside. Lori! Honey? What is going on between the two of you? Just--just go in. Just go in, okay? Talk to her for a second, okay? Just leave it open a little, all right? Where's Kevin and the captain? They're looking for the master key. Tell them to forget about it, okay? Whatever. All right. David, look. Let's go back to my room, man. We can talk about it and calm you down, calm everybody else down. In a few minutes. What's the problem? Hey, hey, hey. David, she's really upset. I don't want to get involved in your family matters. [alarm beeping] Yeah, me neither. Lori said did you have some sort of fantasy that we were all going to disappear like you and I and-- [thunder crashes] Did you see that? Did you see that? What happened to 'em? Honey? Honey? You saw that, right? You saw that. Unbelievable. What's happening? I saw it, I saw it, but I don't believe it. It was a message. What message? What's going on? I don't know. I thought it had to do with you and Kevin-- me? Why? He knew. He knew this was going to happen. Right before they vanished, his alarm, it like beeped. And that's why you wanted me down here. You wanted all of us down here because you knew it was going to happen and you wanted us to see it? Dude, what did you do with them? I didn't do anything with them. I'm as freaked out as you are. My wife, my friends just disappeared in front of me, in front of you. But your watch alarm. You saw the same thing I did. What--what do you think I am, some kind of David Copperfield who can just make things disappear at will? [music] I know I'm not crazy. They all saw it. [shotgun pumping] Just keep talking. I think you're about to get to the interesting part. I don't know. Don't give us that. You're going to tell us what happened or else! Or else what? You'll shoot me? You'll shoot me? [wham!] I'll do worse than that. Go ahead. With my luck, it'll just start all over again. What'll start all over? This day! No matter what I do to change it, it just starts over every day. I'm trapped in it, and so are you. Only I'm the only one who knows it. What, sound crazy? Think about what just happened downstairs. What are you trying to say? Your guess is as good as mine. What if I guess you're behind it? Then, it's a bad guess. Well, what if I just take you out right now? How's that going to affect it? Already been tried. One of you guys already dumped me in the ocean. I don't believe you. You're just messing with my mind. I'm messing with your mind? My wife disappears every day. I know it's going to happen, when it's going to happen and i can't do anything to stop it! And I'm messing with your mind! Sorry, I still don't believe you. I don't know what you did, but I know you did something and that makes you dangerous to the rest of us. And if like you say it starts all over again tomorrow, then you've got nothing to worry about, do you? [gun fires] Don't! No, no, no, no, no! You shot her! Get over there! You shot her! Ethan! You shot her! Get over there! No, no, no! I never meant for this to happen. It's all a part of the plan. What plan? The notebook. I found Larry's notebook. It's just like I remember reading when I was a little girl. God's plan, but I never understood. What plan? I'm not afraid of dying. Not now. I'm going home to him. All these years I spent running from the one who really loved me. Now, I finally found him. Jesus. No! I'll make sure the police get you for this. Why? This is what you wanted. This is why you hired Max to go kidnap her. What? My guess is an artist like Lindsey is worth more when she's dead. It's true, isn't it? What can I say? It worked for 2pac. It's just good business. So, you gonna kill us too? Case notes, grocery list, too bad David doesn't seem happy even being here on vacation. I'd hoped time alone with Lori would help him see what's really important. Are we going to sit here all day? Can I at least get something to drink? Off the side of the boat! July 26th, sermon notes. God claims his own. Today could be the day. In the blink of an eye, we shall be changed. Millions of people rising upward like sunbeams into the eternal presence of God, like a--wait a second. I know this. There's something about it. [wham!] Wait, wait! I think I got it! [gun fires] David. David. Morning. You don't want to sleep away your first day on vacation, do you? Are you all right, honey? Yeah. Yeah. I know this is going to sound weird, but can you get me a Bible? Hmph! Yeah. Yeah, your dream does sound kind of biblical. It's amazing that this made you think about the Bible. It is pretty amazing, isn't it? When were you reading Larry s Bible anyway? I just saw it open on his desk. Okay. Hey, Larry. Now, there's a sight I never thought I'd see. [laughing] I need to talk to you about some dreams i've been having. Maybe this vision is a prophecy. You know, the rapture's at hand and this dream is trying to tell you something that i've been trying to tell you for a while. It's time to get right. I understand. Want me to pray with you right now? You know what? I think I got it. I'm all right. I'm good. [music] [music] You're really in a hurry to get here, aren't ya? I want every minute to count. And Larry thinks the same thing? You don't know how crazy i've been. But in a way, it's I guess it's what I needed to wake me up, who I am, what i've become and to realize how much you mean to me. This dream has opened my eyes that I need to change, Lori. And I need to be a better person. And I realize that if I do that, then I'll never lose you. [alarm beeping] [thunder crashes] No, no, wait! Wait! Why? What do you want from me? Am I not good enough to go? I finally believe in you and now this, again! What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? David. Morning. You don't want to sleep away your first day on vacation, do you? Wait. Wait. Are you okay? Yeah. I have to get ready. I want to go to that beach Suzette told me about. I know you do. Oh. Hey. You okay? Never better. Come on. Get ready. Whatever I have not said or done in our marriage, I'm sorry. Without you, all the terrible things that I see in my job, all the darkness, there'd be no light. The best moments in my life are with you, Lori, and I'm sorry that I don't tell you that every day. I love you, Lori. l love you too. Something tells me this vacation is going to be very special. It already is. I'll be right back. Hey. Can I borrow your Bible? Are you serious? Very. Yeah sure, go ahead. You're a good man, Larry. I've been telling you that for years. No, I mean it. Okay, what's going on? Larry, thank you for never giving up on me. What can I do for you? I believe in God or a God, but what makes your belief different than mine? Look, don't take this the wrong way, okay? But even satan himself believes in God. What I've been talking to you about is a personal relationship with Jesus as your Lord and savior. Is that what I need? Yes. Yes, you do. And if you want me to, I'll walk you through God's plan for our salvation, step by step. I do. All right, brother. Come on. Lord, we come to you in humility on our knees before you. With my brother at my right-hand side, yearning for your presence, yearning for more of you in his heart, in his soul and in his mind. [music] Jesus, thank you for dying on the cross for me. Forgive me for my sins. I ask you into my life, Lord, and I will follow you all the days of my life. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hmm. The heavens are smiling David. Congratulations. He has been waiting on you. We are commanded by God to love even the unloving. Hey. Hi. Look, I know this is going to sound weird, especially coming from me. But I want you to read this. Start right there. Why? Just trust me, right there. ?And He said unto them, 'it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power. Look unto me and be saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God and there is none else.? ?For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.? Hey. Hey. You missed Larry and Suzette. They didn't want to wait anymore. That's all right. I have a feeling we're going to be seeing them again and maybe again. Are you okay? Yeah. Suzette told me what you did, and I think that's great. Really? I did the same. You did? Really? [laughing] Honey, oh my gosh, I'm so happy! Come on. Let's go have a great day. Okay. [music] It's a great day! # [music] The world can open up! # # The sun can fill the sky # Everything can change # # You can feel like # You can fly! # I can't believe how relaxed you seem. It's like a dream. Thank God it's not that. It's a whole new life. [phone ringing] David. Just one phone call, I promise. Hey captain, did you get that e-mail I sent you? Yep, and I was shocked to say the least. I would've expected it from Larry, but not you. You know I don't believe in any of that nonsense. Yeah, I expected you'd say that. But I needed to send it to you, just in case. Just remember, captain. God loves you-- -Yeah, yeah. And don't take the mark. Don't take the mark? What mark? Who's mark? Come here. I love you, Lori. I love you too, David. [music] [thunder crashes] [cars crashing] [explosions] [watch beeping] Hey, Gary! Have you seen Lindsey? [music] [music]
