Macau It looks shady. It doesn't make any sense. - What? - An old man is looking for a pretty carer. A clean-cut single woman... Decision after an interview. Well, it seems obvious. Hang on... Five thousand dollars for a month? It's an old man's bucket list. He needs a young girl before he dies. - Come on... Give it a shot! - Me? The old man's Korean. Called King of the Macau Casinos. Look here. "Korean-speaking preferable." Hmm... Maybe... I could be sorry... The boss never shows up. My money! Stop right there! Calm down! I've been asking you for three months now. Those gangsters have got me so scared, I daren't even go home. Jenny, I don't understand a word you're saying. I scared of gangsters. Scared go home. Gangsters scary men. So why'd you borrow money from them? - You should have raised a proper loan. - For chrissakes!! How often must say? Not me borrowed money. Anyways, don't you worry. Tonight, for your sake, I'll give it absolutely everything I've got. Once I clean up at the Mahjong table, I'll pay you right away. In fact, I'll pay you double. If you'd ever once cleaned up at Mahjong, then I'd... Cough it up, the money you borrowed. You give me little more time, yes? And not me borrow. My friend did. I don't care who did the borrowing. Somebody did, and that's what counts. Besides, your friend already cleared out of Macau. So now this is between just you and me. Just remember... if you've not paid it back by the end of this month, you won't just be serving up beer, It will be hordes of drunken men you'll have to service with that sexy body of yours. Perfect Proposal Im Soo Jung Yoo Yeon Seok Lee Kyeong Yeong Do Hee Jenny Yoo! Have a seat over there. You're Korean, I believe? - Yes - What wine would you like? Allen, Caste? Whatever you like is fine. Let's have our talk in Korean. Ms Jenny Yoo? Graduated college in Korea, Then worked as a tourist guide in Macau. I'm working as a barmaid now. My friend and business partner suddenly ran off. Since then, I've had to find all the money. I suppose in a country like this a lot of people have given you a hard time. I see your only family is your mother. So is your mother in Korea? No. She was killed some time ago in a road accident. - I'm sorry. That was an insensitive question. - I don't mind. It's the sort of thing Koreans always ask. How old are you, what's your family, are you married...? "Macau's Casino King..." What does that bring to mind? I'm not sure... He's Korean... A self-made man... Big charity donor... Those are just lies fed to the media. He's demanding, eccentric and bad-tempered. But very rich. A rich monster. A monster? Excuse me. What was your motive for following up this advertisement? Because I need money. That's extremely honest of you The money your friend made off with must have been a large amount? It's not just the amount. She borrowed money all over the place using my name. My bank balance and my savings were seized and my credit cards blocked. Gangsters are harrassing me day in day out, so I got further into debt. - But do I really have to say any more about this? - Ah no... To be honest, I've interviewed several candidates, but you're the one I like the best. - So I get the job...? - It's not quite that straightforward. There's a certain proposal I want to put to you first. - Proposal? -Are you free tomorrow evening around seven? In the hotel bar here, simply for listening to what I have in mind, I'll pay you a thousand dollars. Wow! You just listen and get a thousand dollars? - I have no idea. - You just hit the jackpot. You get five thousand dollars and just sleep with that old pervert. Oh shut up! Maybe you get to date a hot Korean guy as a free option. You'll go for it? Well... there is one problem. - What is it? - He is too handsome. One thousand dollars. If you want to leave, you can walk out of here whenever you want. Of course, you get to keep the money. First tell me what it's about. Then I'll make up my mind. My boss lost his whole family in an accident ago. He was so devastated, he wouldn't go anywhere, not even on his yacht. What's this got to do with your proposal... As a result of a youthful indiscretion, he has a son. He never made contact with that son until he grew up. One day on some whim or other, he gave orders to find that son. His mother had lived in a hillside hovel in Hongcheon. Unable to afford hospital treatment or even medicine, she'd died. For ten whole years I worked like crazy for my father, hoping he'd accept me as his son. Then not long ago, he made a new will. It leaves all his wealth to good causes. So after everything, that says he never even once thought of me as a son. - But why are you telling all this to me... - I want to get back the self-respect I cast aside. What are you getting at? I know everything there is to know about that man. His tastes in food, his interests and opinions, his taste in women, too. - What kind of woman could win him over... - Exactly what are you saying here? I'm saying you should marry that man. What did you say? - Are you out of your mind? - There's one thing he can't stand. The thought that there's anything in the world he can't possess. The moment he concludes that you can't be bought with money he'll decide that there's nothing else for it but to marry you. I'm sorry. I'm not listening to any more of this. If you go out that door now, that's the end. I can find another candidate, but you'll have those gangsters hounding you for the money your whole life long. You'll have to survive as a barmaid. But if you decide to stay here, you'll be able to pay off all those debts, - and we can talk about ways you could go back to Korea. - But ... you think it could possibly work, that proposal? Money! - Money pay! - So sorry. I promise you to pay the rent by next week. I told you, it doesn't have to be money. , the others don't get this chance... Pay up right now. If you don't have money, get your ass out into the street! I'm saying you should marry that man. If he marries, the property he bequeathed to charities would come to you as his wife. - So what would you get out of it? - A share of what you inherit. Half of it. Okay... Another one... It would be hard for you to do it alone, but if you accept my help, you can become the wealthiest woman in Macau. Does it have to be so many? The way you must do your make-up, the way you've got to dress ... - Give me a twirl I'll teach you to do everything just the way he likes it. Based on advice from top experts in those fields. Mark my words.... If you just do that, you can capture that man's heart. The time we have available is just one month. The time between setting sail from Macau and docking in Busan. Within that space of time, you have to capture his heart. Goodness! You're the image of the late Madam in her younger days! I'm Captain Park, the man who guides the Rising Sun across the waves. Your name? Allow me introduce your new caregiver, Miss Yoo Jiyeon. You're showing up later than expected. As if you'd had to come half way round the world. Since it's a live-in job, I've had to make a lot of preparations for life on board. And I had to say my farewells to the elderly lady I've been caring for in a nursing home. So you were late because of some old hag? Insolent wench. Did you ever take a look at that logo? - No, I didn't. - You'll see it in half the casinos in Macau It's synonymous with me. - Meaning...? - Looking after an old woman barely making ends meet on her pension.... is much less lucrative than caring for me. You get me now? I think you're under a misapprehension. I'm paid a fixed-rate salary. - Supposing I give you a tenfold raise? - If I accepted, I'd be obliged to indulge your quirks. I'm not sure I'd be up to that. So please treat me with the same courtesy you show your other staff. The same courtesy? You really are impudent. When I want you in future I'll go... How's that? When you're in someone's presence, you should look them in the eye and address them by name. And when I'm not nearby, I'd prefer you to use that latest-model cellphone of yours. So, if you've no more to say, I'll go unpack. Wow! That woman's fantastic! You're really totally cool! The best! Shall I introduce you to the rest of the crew? That guy Viktor only looks Russian. He's got no problems eating Korean food, and somehow he manages to speak Korean better than me. And Kahn is from Pakistan. He's not allowed to eat pork. But he absolutely loves instant noodles, so if there's any pork in the broth, you have to tell him. And as for our Captain... He doesn't admit it, but every payday he rushes to the casino and blows his whole month's salary. So, now you've joined the Rising Sun... Welcome! And I'll be rooting for you like my big sister, come what may. Things may get hard, or even revolting, but I'll stick by you through thick and thin. We'll show 'em! Now get some rest. You can become the wealthiest woman in Macau. I'm going to make that happen. You did a good job there. He's been talking about you. What does he say? He's calling you a caregiver with attitude. You obviously didn't make a bad first impression. I nearly died back there. He gave me goosebumps. Like I warned you, he's a demanding and bad tempered old man. Has he always had such contempt for everyone? Yes, for everyone. And for women especially. All his life, the women he's encountered have been after his money, so he views them like pesky flies. So to start with he'll see me as just another pest. I'll just take your temperature. You've got a key in your pocket. Let me borrow it for a moment. - What do you want it for? - I want to get my hands on something. You do realize how bad cigarettes are for your health, I hope? If you let me have that key for a moment, I'll give you a crisp new 100 dollar bill. very well your doctor strictly forbids it. What does that quack know about anything? Money talks. We'll keep this a little secret between the two of us, so let me have that key for a moment, and in return, you'll get 100 dollars. Your blood pressure and temperature are normal. So I'll leave you now. Just one moment! If you won't let me have the key I'll call someone to smash the drawer open. - Then you won't get a single dollar. - Do as you wish. Okay... Okay... It was a mistake to offer you cash, I see that now. So what about this? An original Cézanne miniature. Worth enough to buy you a car. It's really beautiful. Exactly my taste in colors. But I can't accept that either. Thank you for showing me it, though. Stop right there! You're on my payroll, so obey my orders. Go get me a cigarette, right now! My instructions are that cigarettes are like a poison for you. I pay you, so don't you talk back to me! Go get me a cigarette! I'm sorry, but... You refuse? - I do. - How dare you? Don't you get it? Short blasts mean "Do as I say right now," you moron. You've no right to let fly at me like that, so I'm going. - Get lost! - And if you lose you temper this way, what's left of your life will get a whole lot worse, you do realize that? That's all. Miss Yoo! Viktor!! Well done. Keep piling on the pressure like that. Did I really do the right thing? I think he'll throw me out soon. - Far from it. The game's only just beginning. - But supposing I lose the game? Then you're back to serving up beer and avoiding debt collectors. Right! The wecome party for the new caregiver starts now! Miss Jiyeon. I wish that was me. At first, I thought you'd been sent to save me because my life was so hard. - Like a fairy tale? - Except, a few things are missing. First off, I don't have a wicked stepmother bugging me, and when I have to leave on the stroke of midnight. I ought to have a slipper to leave behind. - That's all it would take to make me Cinderella.... - Jiyeon... Are you trying to get romantic with me? Just stick to your instructions. Are you alright? - My heel broke. - Try to stand. - Are you alright? - Yes. Bravo! Diving's a matter of attitude... Of course, you need the right bathing suit, too. - Look there! - What? Oh! Oh my! A gentleman! A gentleman! There's another hat over there. Gosh, he's awesome! You go join the dishwashing team. I'm putting Kahn in charge of waiting on me. But sir, why the sudden change? I wanted liquor and found I was drinking water. I'm not going to let you get through the rest. When did I ever drink your liquor? I know everything that happens on this boat, and I know what you're all thinking, and what you're getting up to. All your secrets. People keep secrets from Buddha, but no-one ever kept them from you. Ah... If you leave that pawn where it is, you can get checkmate with your rook. Checkmate? Gosh that's right, who'd have thought it? This kibitzer has finished you off when I couldn't. But Jiyeon! If you barge into a game like that, what next? - Is it your place to disrupt our game? - Oh, I apologize. Come and sit here! Excuse me? Sit down there, I said. - You play Korean chess? - Well, just a little bit... In that case, give me a proper game. Don't be a coward at another player's elbow. I'm no match for your ability. But you fancy you're a good player? How about I back my own skills? If I win, I don't have to pay your salary this month. But if you win, I'll give you whatever you want. Whatever I want? This game demands logical analysis, so women... ...aren't up to it. - Isn't that so, Captain? - Quite right, Boss. The reason being... women are composed of 30% hysteria, 10% percent vanity, and the remaining 60%... is hankerings after Italian-made designer handbags. - You got it! - Ferragamo, Gucci, Asics, Bulgari... You'd like a Bulgari in your closet, I guess. That's heading for checkmate... Wow, Jiyeon! - Don't get him angry, whatever you do! - It's checkmate, isn't it? Yes, it is indeed. Unbelievable! I win! Shall we play another game? Take as much as you want. Help yourself. I don't accept money, Sir. I haven't told you yet what I want. - So what is it you want? - Give me a piano, please. I noticed in your room there are a lot of photos of you playing the piano. Why are you all still here? Get to your quarters, fast! Lights out and bedtime! All of you, goodnight. Kill the lights! You got the impression he was fond of piano playing, I guess. Well, maybe he was, once. Anyway, one day he issued a summons to all his family and friends to come hear him play. - A summons? - His whole family died in a car crash on the way to the recital. And that's why he's never played the piano since. And I guess after something like that I wouldn't want to, either. All the same, how did the old geezer know I was watering his booze? Bokshil, you know, don't you? I bet you knew all along. I just hope he doesn't get the wrong idea. I'm so sorry. I knew nothing about that matter. It's alright. It reminds me of my dead family, so I detest people talking about my piano playing. - I think that's a pardonable oddity on my part. - When I was in junior high, I went on a trip to a mathematics contest. I was up early trying on dresses, and had a huge fight with my mother - because said I didn't like any of my clothes. - Go away! Digging up things best forgotten is a mean trick. I was gossiping away with my friends when my teacher called me. We rushed frantically back to Seoul. You should cut out the preamble and get to the point. Don't you realize that? In the car, the teacher just kept staring straight ahead at the road. At the hospital I stayed sitting in the car. I realized something was seriously wrong. Suddenly, everything around me stopped moving. For a moment, everything froze. And then I dashed to the emergency room. They told me she'd gone out to buy me a dress, and had an accident. From that day on, I always avoided the street where that clothes store was. In the same way you never play the piano. If you want to make amends to me, talk about things that cheer me up. If you can't find anything more cheerful to talk about, keep that mouth of yours shut in future. Why didn't you tell me? About the piano? If I'd told you in advance, you couldn't have managed such perfect timing. In this game, seeming to react naturally is vital. Causing the death of your own family... Have you any idea how agonizing that is? I guess it must me. I don't know. I'm really not sure whether to carry on with this game. Listen, if you defend your pride against his attacks you can win. He'll try to buy you with his money. But the more you resist... the more desirable you'll grow in his eyes. Defending my pride will make him love me? Is that what you're saying? What I'm talking about has nothing to do with love. What we're involved in is strictly a game. A game where we stand make fabulous winnings. Kahn! I thought he came this way. Today I'm going to show you how it's really done. I don't catch small fry, you know that, don't you, Sir? Is this a fish? Or is it a whale? How's the Seibu casino doing? Not as well as the Macau business, but well enough. If you give the okay, Father... - I mean, if you, Sir, give the go-ahead... - Forget it. If those jerks ever again talk about wanting more money, pull out all our investment. It's a white elephant. Hooked another! Let's see the bastard! Captain! It's a monster! - Let it go, sir! - No, I've got him! Enormous! Shall I? Kahn. You damned imbecile! I almost had him, but you made me lose him! How dare you do that without my orders? Go back to your home country right now! Or else jump in the ocean. and catch that beast. You got that? Sir, Kahn's a lousy swimmer. He'll sink like a brick. Please let this go, please. He's ruined my mood today, so he can provide some entertainment. Come on. Jump in the ocean and grab that fish that got away, Or else clear out of here back your own country. If you won't do either... here are some delicious cuts of top-quality sirloin pork. Eat them up! Get stuck in! Anyone who helps that bastard can leave this boat as well. Come on! Go, go, go, go! Go, Kahn! Ji Yeon! That's quite enough! Can't you see how everyone's suffering? There sure are a lot of spoilsports today! I was just enjoying a little game. If you carry on ruining things, you can get of this boat as well. - Get back to your proper place. - Please... You know Kahn did that for your sake. It's like I've said from the start... you just don't know how to keep that stupid pride of yours in check. - I'm begging you. Stop this now - Okay. You've decided to stick with your pride. So let me give you something to remember from your time here. Pay close attention. This here is my kingdom. I'm the owner of this boat, and all the rest of you are just puppy-dogs I play with. So all of you... will obey every word I say. You'll obey without hesitation! If I tell you to eat pork, you'll eat pork. If I tell you to fetch me a cigarette, you'll fetch me a cigarette! You say you have your pride? It's to break that stupid pride of yours that I pay you so much money. Yoo Ji Yeon, I'm the one who pays you. You too have to obey me without question. If you don't want to, just shut your mouth and clear off for good. Yoo Jiyeon... Here. - I guess everything's ruined now? - No. Not till the referee blows the final whistle. But you need to come back before things get worse. I'm not going back to that boat. I'll give you a word of advice. That man owns half the casinos in Macau. and more bonds and shares than you could ever imagine. - His cash holdings alone are worth more than a hundred billion Won. - I know that. But I'm still not going back to that boat. I utterly detest that man. I can't take any more of him. Now listen... He's already almost swallowed the bait. One further tug and he'll be hooked. No! Even if I married him he'd stay just the same. He'll live ten years longer or more, So you expect me to survive ten years, maybe longer, waiting for him to die? I won't do it. And if I did survive it.. Suppose he discovers the truth and casts me aside? What then? Will I just get thrown on the street with a measly settlement? Very well. Have it your own way. Go back to the cesspool you came from. I'll find someone to replace you. You want her back now, don't you? When you were with you late wife, you looked really happy. You were always so full of vitality. But since you've been left on your own, you've looked so miserable. What you really need is someone by your side. Like you had in the old days, I mean. I sometimes miss the way your wife smiled, too. With that lovely smile of hers, she was always devotedly there for you whenever you got angry. Whenever you mistreated your employees, she strongly disapproved, didn't she? But suddenly today a thought struck me. - That caregiver, too, told you straight out what she thought about... - Captain! Shut the fuck up! Captain! Goodnight. Let's go to wherever that woman is. I'll take you there. As soon as I leave here, the boat will be putting to sea. - Pack your things and come back with me. - I'm sorry, but I can't do that. I'll give you $10,000 if you do. And take you to Korea, where you couldn't go for so long. - I'm sorry. - $20,000 If you carry on making such offers, I'll go back to my room. I don't know why I'm here haggling with you like this. So I slipped up, but now I'm offering you twenty million Won. What more do you expect from me? I'm giving you five minutes. After that I'm going back upstairs. My first job after I came to Macau was as a Pierrot. All my movements had to be governed by the troupe-leader's whistle. One long blast for "get training", two short ones for "take a break". Sometimes even when I'd just finished a meal, I'd hear a whistle blow, and by a reflex action, I'd find myself twirling my plate. Then one day, the theater was destroyed by fire. In the chaos, I stole the troupe leader's whistle. I wanted to see people always obey this this whistle. It seems you got what you wanted. But to get what I wanted everything else had burned to ashes. One day, I came to my senses and looked around and behind me. All that was left of me was a wealthy, cantankerous old man. And all around me, were nothing but buzzing flies attracted by the stink of money. The best way to drive those flies away was to treat them with contempt. The five minutes is up. I'm returning to my room now. But recently, Viktor has been giving me some knowing looks. He looks at me and smiles and says I'm looking happy. He says I've started to look him in the eye when I talk to him, and call him by his name. And I've stopped summoning him with my whistle. Of course, not everything can change overnight. But the important thing... is that I actually have gradually been changing. Somehow or other, that's down to you. And someone who is capable of changing me... is someone I want to have by my side always. - What do you mean? - Yoo Jiyeon... I'm asking you to marry me. But I'm not going back to that boat. I utterly detest the man. I can't take any more of him. Very well. Have it your own way. Go back to the cesspool you came from. I'll find someone to replace you. After the wedding, I'll be spending some time in Korea. Perhaps I'll stay there the rest of my life. - So... What about the Macau casinos? - Jang Hyejin will run them. Why? Had you gotten your hopes up? No. I've worked my hardest for ten years, but... she's worked thirty years longer. It's not a matter of length of service. You aren't suited to the casino business. Success is 90% down to effort, and only 10% talent. But you don't even have that 10%. Look into a more suitable line of business. Draw up a proposal for me to check out. I'm touched to think you'll let me choose my own path. You should realize you have your mother to thank for your situation. Because of one night's folly, she insisted on giving birth to you. Mother... She fell prey to that sort of love through her stupidity. Don't speak ill of my mother. Though you're normally meek as a lamb, the mere mention of your mother gets you enraged. I hang around you because of your money, but for thirty years at least, my mother loved you more than anyone else. And all that time, father, you left her penniless. Everything's ready, Sir. If you search on Google tomorrow morning, you'll find a hundred or so articles about you. So many? From now on, you'll always hear yourself called Cinderella. Cinderella... Do you know the original meaning of "Cinderella"? "Cendrillon". It means "the ashes girl" Even after midnight strikes, when all she has left is the glass slipper, there's one thing she has to ask herself. "When I look into the mirror right now, what sort of person looks back at me?" "A Cinderella with her glass slipper?" "or just another version of my wicked stepmother?" And if she doesn't like what she sees, then she must look into her own eyes in that mirror ask herself a question, and answer it truthfully. "If I want to change the sort of person I'm seeing in the mirror," "what do I need to do?" So are there people who can change what they see in the mirror? Of course! I know know a circus girl who did just that. It earned her the top management job under the richest man in Macau. I couldn't tell you earlier with people around, but he's changed his will. Now it's up to you to keep your promise. Have you changed your mind? Even if you only get half... you've still become the richest woman in the world. Don't worry. I'll give you half, just as I promised. It's just that it all happened so suddenly. I feel like I'm in a dream. Then enjoy that dream. When you wake up from it, your like may have been turned completely around. What about you? Nothing much will change for me. It's not me who's the Cinderella. It's you. Is that all? Don't you have anything else to say to me? Is there something more you'd like me to say? Are you asleep? Are you? - What? - He's dead. - What did you say? - I said he's dead. He is! Gosh, you scared me. What on earth... What happened? I don't know. I tried to wake him up... - Does anyone else know, apart from me? - No. I've told no-one. The for now we've got to keep this a secret from everyone. What? The will hasn't been notarized yet. Unless it's notarized, the new will's not worth the paper it's written on. - What are you saying? - Everything we've achieved so far is worthless, until we get the will notarized. Around lunchtime, we'll be arriving at Busan. While the arrival formalities are going on, I'll get the will notarized, while you're getting him to the house. What? That's completely insane! How can I do that with a corpse? I can't do that. I won't. I'm going to call the police. Come to your senses. If you do, you'll be the prime suspect. He's dead, but so far we've got our hands on nothing. Are you proposing to give up now on billions of dollars? We have to keep acting as though he was still alive. Stick to his routine by calling Viktor to tidy the room. And order coffee, too. Then go down to the dining room and say your husband has a bad cold and won't be coming down today. You got that? Please! Please don't leave me alone! Look me in the eye, Jiyeon. It wasn't you that did this, was it? Tell me honestly. In that case, it's fine. Put your trust in me. Aren't you dressed yet? Your coffee will be stone cold. Is there something more you need to do? No. Right. I'll leave you in peace. Counting this score and that one -- 17 points. Hey! Let's play till I'm cleaned out. Smile. A newly-wed with a face like that will arouse suspicions. - I can't do this. I feel like they all know. - Stop worrying. They're all aware that he's eccentric and despises everyone. And I've told them he's very sick today. All the same, with all those people watching, how can we get him off the boat? It can be done. We just have to get him to his house safely, then it's in the bag. Now smile, please! While I'm getting the will notarized, keep the door locked and let no-one in. It will take me two hours, three at the most. Once that's done, we can both start to live our new lives. I hope you had a lot of sweet dreams last night. - I did, thank you. - But your husband...? I'm afraid he's not feeling too well. I guess he overdid it. People his age can run out of steam... Let's just get on with our breakfast. We've got various things to attend to. That's true enough... By the way... you need to brace yourself. Hundreds of reporters are gathering in Busan right now. They want to see Cinderella. So what's tycoon Kim Seokgu's new wife like? What did it take to capture his heart and be transformed from caregiver to Cinderella bride? Soon we'll catch sight of.... - Welcome to Busan! -Hush! Be patient a while. We'll have you home soon. And it's best not to try talking. Your cold's really bad. Please hurry things along. He's feeling so ill he wants to get home as fast as possible. Ah, I see. - So we need to hurry. - Why are you hanging around. Didn't you hear me? I've told you what a bad state he's in. - Of course. - Viktor, get moving. Escort us home. Right. Viktor, get on with it! Let's go, Sir. Would you like me to call on ahead to the hospital? No. He's just exhausted. Let's get him home first. Hold out a little longer. We'll arrive home in an hour, then I'll call a doctor. So, would you like me to cancel all your engagements today, Sir... or should I How many times do I have to tell you? He's really sick! - All the same, we should cancel... - Talk to his secretary about that. He'll take care of all that. Ah.. right. So, right this very moment here behind me, Kim Seokgu and his new wife Yoo Jiyoun are disembarking. Kim Seokgu is in a wheelchair, and alongside him is... Look this way please! Please look over here! Will you say a few words? How do you feel right now? He's fallen asleep. I'd like to take him quietly to his bedroom. I've prepared the first floor bedroom he always uses. Shall I get lunch ready to serve? No thanks. We'll rest a while, then I'll call you. - He has always had lunch at this time for the past 20 years. - He's married to me now, so a lot of things have changed. I see. My name is Jang Hyejin. I'm in charge of managing Mr Kim's schedule. There is no reply on this number... I can't take any more of this. I know. It must be really hard on you. You've been doing really well. So, what now? Now I'm going to see the notary. You have to hold out till then. But then it will all be done with, yes? As I told you on the boat, the time of death is crucial. - He mustn't die till the will's been notarized. - What's that supposed to mean? Of course, there'll have to be an autopsy. That will involve examining his stomach contents. In which case, they'll need to find food he ate here. I ordered abalone porridge for lunch. Two helpings. You have to eat one helping yourself, then after that, you need to force the other helping into his stomach using a syringe and a nasal tube. What are you... How could I possibly do that? Don't give any thought to what you're doing. You know very well we got into this just for the money. At 3 p.m. a doctor friend of mine will arrive to issue the death certificate. Just focus on that. 3pm! You can do it, surely? I'm told that Mr Kim is rather unwell. Not to worry. He'll be fine after a little rest. That sort of judgement is usually left to a doctor. If you're in doubt, go in and see him. Assuming you want to see him fly into a rage like the last time you woke him up. I have to ask you to come with me. Can't you just issue the certificate here? I'm really tired right now. The certificate? My husband's passed away, Doctor. I thought you came to issue the death certificate. Ah, I see there's been a misunderstanding. I'm Kang Changki from the Busan Police Department. Mr Kim's assistant tipped us off there was a serious problem, so I'm here to investigate. Please accompany me to the station. What on earth are you doing? Give Kim Seongweol a call! Give Kim Seongweol a call! Isn't that Miss Jiyeon? Why worry about her? But when are you going to dump that smelly pooch? Hey, don't call her a smelly pooch! You really are a bonehead. You know how much he's worth in ransom money? Why did you conceal it? Your husband's death. I didn't conceal anything. It was today that he died. I'm warning you. You need to give me some truthful answers. I ate lunch with him today. Up to that time at least he was very much alive. We discovered this in the bedroom. The traces of abalone porridge in the bloodstained feeding tube matched the porridge that was found in your husband's stomach. The porridge he supposedly chewed and swallowed, was introduced into his stomach through this tube. We now have the autopsy results. The cause of death was oxygen deprivation due to asphyxia. You know what asphyxia means, don't you? While he was asleep, someone blocked up his nose and mouth and killed him. But the time of his death turned out to be in the early hours of today between two and three a.m. In other words, he didn't die in the bedroom at his home. He died on the yacht. So why did you move his body all the way to the house> - I don't know. - Everyone on the boat testifies you were behaving suspiciously. Especially your driver! He says he could plainly see in his rearview mirror that your husband was dead. - I don't know. - Just listen to you! You took a huge risk transporting the body. Sure, you thought you had everyone fooled. But why did you do it in the first place? - What was the sense in it? - I wasn't the one who killed him. - I swear it. I truly wasn't me. - Even if you didn't kill him... interfering with the body was an offense in itself. Why the hell did you move the body? Why did you even inflict injury on it? Look, this story of yours makes no sense. Unless you tell the truth, you're in massive trouble. I had to keep the fact that he'd died secret just for one day. He'd changed his will. Leaving everything to me instead of to charities. I had to hold out somehow until the changed will had been notarized. - So you claim he'd changed his will? - Please, send for Kim Seongyeo He'll testify that everything I've said is true. Yoo Jiyyeon here has told us a very interesting story. She says that just before he died, your father changed his will. I've already told them all about the will and waiting for the notary. That's complete nonsense. - What? You plainly told me that... - After my father made his present will five years ago, he never ever changed it. But you told me the will had been notarized today. Meaning the money was all mine. Yoo Jiyeon! Do you think getting a will notarized is so straightforward? Do you know how much paperwork it takes to inherit just a corner store? Those City Hall legal vultures milk it for all it's worth. Do you really think it would take less than half a day to transfer everything to you? For God's sake say something! How can you just sit there? Come to your senses, Yoo Jiyeon! You mean you don't realize what a monstrous thing you did to my father? Why in God's name did you kill him? I went to see Kim Seokgu's attorney, and everything Kim Seongyeol said was true. He changed his will just one time, five years ago. Upon his death, his son was to have 10%, The remaining 90% was to go to community charities and suchlike. But with one proviso. In the case of Kim Seokgu marrying again, that 90% was to go to his new wife instead. - So it was all to go to the new wife? - That's right. Are you awake now? - Why did you say that back there? You're a smart woman. Think back carefully to the first time we met. - Just what are you trying to say? - Kim Seokju's property that he'd bequeathed to charity, - would pass to you as his wife. - We were supposed to share it between us. - If you want to win this game... - It's no longer a game. I guess it's time to tell you about Article 1004 of the Civil Code. - What's that about? - Because you killed your husband, you forfeit your inheritance rights. But I didn't kill him, did I? That's not what really matters. Since you've been stripped of your inheritance rights, the inheritance passes to the next in line. Who do you think that is? That's what really matters. Why are you telling me this? I'm terrified. If you tell me any more... She dropped out of a low-status College in Korea three years ago and came to Macau. Her circumstances fit the bill, too. The only family she had died in a road accident. She trained as a tourist guide, and set up a tour guide company with a friend. Her friend then disappeared with all the money. She owes $70,000 to gangsters. Her passport's been taken away. All things considered, she's the best candidate. She bears a very close resemblance to Kim Seokgu's deceased wife. So you were just using me? Don't look at me so reproachfully. I did briefly hesitate myself. So much so, I thought about ruining the plans I'd made over so many years. I'll tell the whole story. That will really ruin your plans! This man's the criminal. He's behind all this. - I was only carrying out his instructions. -Yoo Jiyeon! Yoo Jiyeon! - You've got to believe me. - Pull yourself together! - Detective Choi, play that recording. - Yes, sir. I utterly detest that man! I can't take any more of him. No! Even if I married him he'd stay just the same. He'll live ten years longer or more, So you expect me to survive ten years, maybe longer, waiting for him to die? I won't do it. And if I did survive it.. Suppose he discovers the truth and casts me aside? What then? Will I just get thrown on the street with a measly settlement? Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! I trusted you. The look in your eyes. The things you said The way you acted. Everything about you. So how could you do this to me? Why did you trust me? Did you think that simply by trusting me... you could get your hands on all that money? I thought everything through in the finest detail. For years on end I planned, analyzed, labored... - Stop it! - You thought the world had a happy ending in store just for you. You were delusional. You thought you could have it all, for no effort, at no cost... - That's enough! Stop it! - Make sure you progress this without any hitches. - I will, sir. "When I look into the mirror right now, what sort of person looks back at me?" "A Cinderella with her glass slipper?" "or just another version of my wicked stepmother?" And if she doesn't like what she sees, then she must look into her own eyes in that mirror ask herself a question, and answer it truthfully. "If I want to change the sort of person I'm seeing in the mirror," "what do I need to do?" Jenny! Jenny! Everyone on board the Rising Sun at the time of the event will be attending the funeral ceremony. I know know a circus girl who did just that. It earned her the top management job under the richest man in Macau. I can spare you no more than 10 minutes. The funeral ceremony's about to start. That's why I wanted you to come, so I could ask if I could attend the funeral. You belong here in the cells, rather than at the funeral. I beg you. I simply have to take one last look at him. You're a brazen bitch to say such a thing. When you look at me, what do you see? - A woman who killed her husband. - Take another look. - What do you see in me? - A woman who killed her rich husband. I don't like appearing that way, because I didn't kill him. Not liking how you look doesn't alter it one bit. You're wrong. I can change it, since I don't like it. All I have to do is look at myself in the mirror and speak truthfully. The same way a circus girl once did. Attorney Ho... Hold on! What do you think you're doing! She's just playing you to get out of here. This is a woman who killed her husband. Things aren't at that stage yet! Right now, she's still in line to receive a hundred billion Won legacy. And she's my client. I'm still not letting her go. If she happens to get away, my neck's on the line. You know something...? Detective Kang here only needs to step out of line one more time and he'll lose his badge. He's already been formally reprimanded for contempt of due process. - If it happens just one more time - Oh, what the fuck! Okay! But my boys will stick to her like leeches till the funeral's over. Are you sure? About that crewman from Pakistan being at the funeral? I'm sure he'll come. But what's so important about that circus girl? It refers to a girl who was once saved from commiting suicide by a Pierrot. If Mr Kim told you about that, it proves he regarded you as a true member of his family. Thank you for believing in me. Don't deceive yourself. It's your late husband I trust, not you. But for my part, I'm inclined to believe you. Because once you've fought off this false charge, you're going to be fabulously rich. Oh, and there's this. But at this rate you aren't going to get to the funeral on time. [In Urdu] She didn't do it. I've got evidence, evidence! He's gabbling a mixture of English and double-Dutch. I want to see Jiyeon right now! Hey you! Are you a Rising Sun ... what's the word? - ... stewardess? Really? - Hurry! What's the guy on about? I can't make head nor tail of it. Hey, hey, hey! Can't you cut the noise? Yoo Jiyeon has disappeared! - Miss Yoo! - Ah, Yoomi! Mister Kim! Mister Kim. Look at me! I don't care what anyone else says, I believe you. - So you've got to keep your spirits up! - Thank you. Oh, and take this. It's photos of you taken on the yacht. I think they were meant as a surprise present for you. - Perhaps you should get them framed. - Thanks. But I'm afraid I've things to do right now. Oh, and I can't persuade Bokshil to eat anything. - So in a while I thought I'd try taking him back to the yacht. - Tell me, did you happen to spot Kahn just now? - Kahn? I think I just saw him. - Where? Where did you see him? - Hey, take it easy! - It's not Jiyeon! I got an idea. To find suspect... There is one thing that nobody knows. On board, I was checking everything. - Every night... - OK, let's take a look uh? Did you know that? Over there! Yoo Jiyeon! - Stop right there! - If she get's away, we're dead! Stop right there! Yoo Jiyeon! Just where did you think you were going? What's this. Some sort of diary she got hold of? It's actually an Ipad. With photos in it. - But... they're shot from a strange angle. - Eh? How do you mean? I know everything that,happens on this boat, what you're all thinking, - and what you're getting up to. - All the same, how did the old geezer know I was watering his booze? Bokshil, you know, don't you? I bet you knew all along. - Let me see that! - Yoo Jiyeon, what are you doing? Stop the car. I need to make a phonecall - Please, please stop! - Yoo Jiyeon! Yoo Jiyeon! Oh hi, Yoomi! Did you take Bokshil home with you by any chance? Sorry I didn't ask permission. I just felt sorry for her. I meant no harm. Ah... I see. Well, I think you should bring her back now. Should I take her back to the yacht, then? That's actually what I'm doing right now. - Sure! See you on board, then. - Okay! - This is Yoo Jiyeon. - What? I can't explain while I'm driving. Look in the phone that was taken from me and find Im Yoomi's number. - Who's Im Yoomi? - There's no time to explain. Hurry up! - Fantastic boat! Just like a hotel. - Isn't it? Hello? O hi, Miss Yoo. I'm bringing Bokshil back right this minute. That's right. I'm going to be meeting him on the yacht anyway. Ah, here he is now! He's the murderer. Grab Bokshil and get out of there fast! Miss Yoo... what was that you just said. - Get out of there right now! Kim Seongweol is the killer! -What's wrong? No! Let go! So this is where he said there's a hidden camera? The creepy bastard! Miss Yoo. Are you alright? Miss Yoo! Are you alright? What on earth happened here? And what now? A mini camera in a hairpin on the dog's head had recorded Kim Seonyouil committing the murder. Cleared of the false accusations, Yoo Jiyeong has now become the owner of casinos in Macau and is the focus of public attention, acclaimed as a second Cinderella. Sitting opposite you like this reminds me of our first meeting. Back then, you struck me as a creature from a different world. - The way you spoke, the way you moved, everything. - You were a real simpleton, weren't you? As stupid as they come. Did you really have to kill him? When I was in middle school, my mother was really sick. That was when she told me about that man for the first time. I wrote to him in Macau, asking him to pay her hospital bills. My mother... was dying. I told him so in dozens of letters. Or actually, in hundreds of them. But I only ever got one single response: "Stop trying to contact me, or else!" So is that why you made those plans? - Over so many years? - My plans weren't complete till I encountered you. Until then I'd never found the right person. But I was always straight with you. I got into this to help you, I did everything you told me to. So how could you... Stop fooling yourself! You're saying it was for my sake you married that man and even treated his corpse like that? Can you honestly claim... the thought that I intended to kill my father, never crossed your mind? Did you never ever... have any feelings for me? Not in the slightest. Never. Not even for one second. Remember one thing. I was the one who made you into Cinderella. And the one who woke you up from your dream... was me. Resync by edprthm
