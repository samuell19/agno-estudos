- Previously on "Hunters"... - McCarthy. You let our most prized asset get away. Abby isn't dead. I was with her yesterday. She's gone, Emme. You have to let her go. I know what you are. I've seen one. Guanos are after a human. - Sterling Martinez. - It's just research. Don't know why they want him. It has to do with something they called the Purge. - Do not disappoint me. - I won't. - You don't know shit about me. - You don't know shit about you. And what about Regan's father? - He clearly loves his child. - Who did this to you? He wasn't spared torture. Which is precisely why I kept you out of it. Your mother tried to kill me. She's Musa's right hand. _ Abby doesn't want to turn herself in, this is her play. You're not gonna have the guts to do anything about it. Why the hell didn't you stop her?! I couldn't imagine living without you. You're a survivor, Flynn. I only keep on going because of you. I didn't think I'd ever have coffee again. Or see you. If we're gonna keep meeting, there are things I need to ask you. - Finnerman's conditions? - No, my conditions. I don't give a shit what Finnerman wants. I care about stopping Musa. We don't have the capacity to house prisoners. It's only temporary. And I have nowhere else to house him now, do I? The last thing we need is McCarthy to turn up to the black site and attempt a rescue mission. Regan should not be interrogating her own father. - It's too personal. - For her or for you? Jackson. What? When? Is Flynn all right? What can you tell me about Viktor Karp? I don't know the name. Karp was moving lithium out of the mine you and mom ran. ETU raided the offices last week. He started as a drug runner. Now he transports weapons. Is Musa planning an attack? - I mean, is that what the Purge is? - I... I don't know. I never met Karp. Only your mother dealt with him. So Mom dealt with Karp, what did you do? I had other business. I also maintained the family unit. I took my job seriously. That part was always real. Guy's got nine lives. Got away with just cuts and bruises. And a hell of a hangover. We sure it was just an accident? Doc says his blood alcohol level was 0.23. Deliberate, then? Because of his wife? That and he's battle-bent. Came at me pretty hard yesterday. Are you two going to be able to work together? No, I don't take that shit personally. But I can't say the same for sleeping beauty. God knows he could tell anybody anything. It was his drive to find his wife that led us to McCarthy. Perhaps he can still be of some use. And if he's not? Well... we pull the plug. Latest SAT intel has Karp running planes from a dirt strip in Northern Mexico. No, we know where Karp is, and his entire family for that matter. That's never been the issue. We just confirmed, Karp's working with the Hunters. Karp also has ongoing dealings with the CIA. - He's protected. - I don't want Karp. I want the bitch he answers to. - Your mother. - She knows more than my dad ever could. That's whose fingernails you should be pulling out with pliers. You did well with your father. You gained more in ten minutes than we have in years. You hurt him again and I will tear your throat out. Careful, Agent Regan. Threatening a superior officer is cause for immediate dismissal. You won't. You need me and you know it. Let me go to Mexico. I go through Karp to get my mom and I bring her back. In exchange, you release my dad. I don't feel anything. The scute protein's solution's tricky, but I think I'm making progress. You think? Well, I haven't slept in days. Maybe if you just let me get some rest. I just got kidnapped by space aliens to conduct a freaking top secret science experiment. You know what we need. Accelerated regrowth of your native mantle. I understand what you're asking but come on. He's doing the best he can. Do better. Liana's under a lot of pressure. Don't worry, once you crack this, you'll be back home, safe and sound. What if I can't? I won't let her harm you. You have my word. _ Adíos. Allison's in a play this weekend. - Put the meeting off a couple days. - You know I can't do that. Going to school events is what normal parents do. So you're behind schedule in your research because of PTA meetings? There is no time to waste! We've got to get the reversion procedure working! Mommy? Allison. What are you still doing up? It's late, honey, you should be asleep by now. This is exactly what I'm talking about. Fostering human tendencies only confuses her. - It's not fair, Ted. - Let's get you back to bed. Making her think she's something she's not, it's not fair to her! Déjame verla. No le dejen mover. Take off your clothes. She's clean. Viktor Karp, I'm Regan. Agent Regan of Homeland Security. ETU. I'm out. That's why I'm here. What happened here? I had a baby. The humans took it. Why you want to see Liana? I'm her daughter. Liana doesn't have a daughter. You're at home. So I see. I had you brought here. We needed you someplace private in case you said something you shouldn't. Flynn, you got a drug problem. No. - No. I got an alien problem. - Well, you need to deal with it before I let you back on the team. Team? Right. 'Cause we're all just team players, aren't we, Truss? You're using me. You're using Regan. God knows what you got on Briggs. You are privy to information that is beyond classified. And if I don't come back and play, you're gonna contain me? If I have to. Flynn, are you all right? Yeah, I'm great. - What are you doing here? - My counselor brought me. Your boss said you had an accident. Yeah. Your story checks out. Well, I'm sorry for the security measures. Are you comfortable? Give me what I want and I don't give a damn where you hold me. You fought against the Hunters, but now you want to join them? The humans took me away from my mother. They took my baby. They used me, made me fight against the Hunters. I want to be with my own kind. I think I believe that. So Liana's coming for me? Not quite yet. First time I shot up, I was 16. I was a punky-ass kid on a skateboard. In the parking lot of a 7-11 in Davenport, Texas, I bought a dime bag from a dealer named Shotgun Vallardo. One taste and I was hooked. So you were a junkie. Is that supposed to impress me? Oh, I wasn't hooked on the junk. I was hooked on the deal. Next day I was running for Shotgun. And six months later, Shotgun's wife was a widow and I had every last one of his buyers in my pocket. See, we're the same under the skin, you, me, all us Hunters. We have the same animal urges. The desire, the will, and the strength to destroy and dominate. What are you gonna do with my blood? Angel, don't you worry your pretty little head about that. You keep your end of the deal and I'll keep mine. Anything you'd like to say about what you've heard so far? We've reunited you with your daughter. I only ask that you translate Hunter recordings that we've intercepted. No. I'll start then, shall I? Hunters have been sourcing lithium. Enriched lithium is a fuel source for nuclear warheads. And Musa has been working with Viktor Karp, and arm's dealer who has access to long-range missiles. All right so far? Well, you seem to have it all worked out. What do you need from me? Cockroaches are extraordinary creatures. Very hardy. They're extremely adaptive. They molt. They chirp. They have shells. And they can survive a nuclear explosion. Hunters molt. They click. They have shells. And they have nuclear weapons. I think that you, Hunters, are reverting to your alien shells because Musa is planning a nuclear attack, and that's how you'll survive. You have no idea what you're talking about. We did well in raising your daughter for you, don't you think? By turning her against her own kind? - No. No, I don't. - When we found Allison, she was on a direct course for self-destruction. Poor kid would be dead by now if we hadn't intervened. We saved her life, Ted. You might even say that I still have a hand in keeping her alive. Should we have another listen? Don't worry. Your daughter's not going anywhere. Yeah, we can keep her as long as you like. I understand your timeline, Liana. No, we're arranging transportation now. Tell Musa his delivery's on its way. Florida, seriously? Right. Well, we'll move somewhere colder, then. - Canada? - Maple syrup and mullets? No thanks. Did mom fight for me? You told her I wanted to live with you, right? Yes, but... She didn't put up a fight, did she? Liana was overwhelmed by the news. She doesn't want us to leave. - Screw her. - Don't be like that. Like what? She's never home. She treats you like shit. - She hates me. - She doesn't hate you. - Hey. - What are you two up to? Nothing, God, don't be such a paranoid freak. Party time, princess. It's time for us to say goodbye. Like hell. We made a deal, Karp. - Liana's coming. - She's... she's coming here? It's a family reunion. And I'm off to one of my own. Farewell, my sweet. Your generosity will not be forgotten. It was just an accident. Motorcycles don't have seat belts. You could have died. If you had died, I'd be alone. You wouldn't be Flynn, you'd just be dead. Emme, I said I'm sorry. What else do you want me to say? Huh? He's fine, he's fine, he's fine, he's fine. How are you holding up, Emme? Holding what up? How are you doing with Flynn being hurt? I'm fine. He's not going to die. Did my counselor leave? She'll be here in a few minutes, take you back home. You mean school. This is my home. Yeah, of course it is. I'm gonna go look for Haydn. The cat. The composer's dead. Okay. Shit! _ Abby? What? Is this usual for your... people in your native form? She's building a nest. We do it during molting and breeding. - I know, it looks... - Freaky as shit. No offense. Trust me, it's a good sign. Can I ask you something? Is everyone here, all the workers, are they... what you are? No, a few are human, scientists like you are. - They're here of their own accord. - Lucky them. I'm sorry I had to bring you here like this. It's not me that I'm worried about. It's my family. - My kids. - You have children? Two. Six and eight. They live with my ex. You? You have any little ones? A daughter. She's 16. She here? She's not with me anymore. You miss her? Very much. The mantle's quite pronounced now. You're almost home. Hey, Mom. Why did you come here? I needed to see you... in person. You didn't ask to see me before, - when you were with Musa. - I wanted to, but I was afraid. Of your own mother? I thought you would reject me, send me away. And yet you ran away from the Hunt, from Abby and the others. It was too much too fast. When I saw Jules, I couldn't handle it, but Musa was right. I don't belong at the ETU. I'm tired of hating myself, of fighting what I really am. You can help me. You didn't raise me as a Hunter, but you can now. I want you to be my mom again. Why should I believe you? I'm here, aren't I? Love does swing the hammer. I'm not gonna hurt you, Mom. Then show me. Come closer. It's been ten years since we've seen each other. The least you can do is give me a hug. You think I'm gonna hurt you? You would if Musa told you to. What Musa and I have struggled for is worth more than any one single person. It's about our species' survival. We've all had to make sacrifices. Now tell me, I was yours. The bond between Hunters is different, deeper than humans. We're not just family, we're inside each other, it's how we're made. Losing you was the worst thing that ever happened to me. Like a part of me was ripped from my flesh. And I never forgot it, Allison, never. Not one day has gone past when I haven't thought of you. You... are a part of me. And I love you. I love you, too. That hollow in your back is sacred. That's where we carry our young in their native form. You defiled it because you despise yourself. I blame your father for that. Ted ruined you, Allison, and yet I'm the one you hate. You were born a Hunter! You know how you came to look like you do? I chose this body for you, a vehicle to keep you safe and strong. You killed someone for their body? For you! I chose well. - I was a child. A baby! - That baby would have died anyway. Its mother was a drunk, living in a slum. I did it a favor and I did it for you! Stop! No! There's water in the tap. Good to know. - Where's Jackson? - Change of shift. Come back for more, have you, tough guy? Oh, you're looking a whole lot worse than I am. Whatever. Where are you going? Tequila and tacos. You want? Come back inside, we need to talk. - I'm done talking. - Let's head inside. Ah, shit. Seriously? Okay. I get it. Jackson's hatchet, man. Come on. Here I am, do it. Go back inside the house, I'll grab my service weapon, tell Jackson I made a move on you. He doesn't have to know. I'll take it from here, Agent Briggs. Let's take a drive. She's beautiful. I envy you, your emotional responses to things, I... I train myself out of it. But there has been a cost. Well, maybe you should stop with the daddy routine. Let people figure it out themselves. You're right, Flynn. I can't fix you. Only you can do that. This was just after you escaped from the Hunters in Afghanistan. You're not suicidal, Flynn. You're angry. The Hunters did something to you. And until you face it, find out what really happened, it will kill you. So who cares? Emme does. You're all she has now. Don't let the Hunters take everything away from her, too. How was Karp? His shipment's arrived. I've got everything we needed from him. What's the status on the reversion? One of Sterling's solutions was successful. You've been observing Sterling. Can you replicate the process? Can you replicate the process without him? - Yes. - Then you know what comes next. It's all here? Something so huge contained in these notes. Incredible. The incredible thing is our species working together. In a few days, I have accomplished what no other human scientist could even dream of. Imagine what we can learn from one another. Humans would never accept us. They see us as monsters. You're not monsters, not to me. Not anymore. You're just trapped in a skin that doesn't fit you. In a world that just doesn't understand you, but people can change. Yes, we can. Tell me about your children. My girl, Mariana, she's six. She loves racing cars. Anything to do with speed. And Lucas, he... He has dark masses of curly hair and his eyes are... like two bright shining stars. Sorry. So Karp packed up his Mexican operation? We don't know where he is now. He was moving lots of stuff. Supplies, heavy duty equipment. Crazy stunt, but no infection. You are all good. Thanks, Doc. When I was at Karp's compound, I saw something being hauled in on a giant flatbed. It was long, metallic, cylindrical, like a submarine. It was massive. A missile? Yes. Full report on my desk by morning. I want my dad released. You didn't fulfill your end of the bargain. However, I will allow continued access to your father. He's been surprisingly cooperative since you two have been talking. Dad? You don't look so good. What's happened? I didn't think I'd see you again. Finnerman keeps us guessing. She came to see me. - If she hurt you... - No, no. She... she didn't lay a hand on me. I'm fine, really, I'm just... I'm just tired. Whose body am I in? You've seen Liana. That's what happened to your face, isn't it? Dad, tell me the truth. Where did this, me, come from? I need to know. Musa sent you to us from a breeding camp. Your mother found you a human skin, even though I knew what it meant... an innocent. Did it have a name? The baby? Allison. From the day you became Allison, I vowed to protect you with my life. But... I failed you. No. Yes. We should have left. Gone on the run. I'm so, so sorry. Dad, don't. You did everything you could to protect me. I always will. I don't know what you're saying. I'm saying that I love you. As long as I'm alive, you're in danger. - They'll use us against each other. - Who? Finnerman? I won't let her. I couldn't protect you before, Allison. But I can now. Dad, what have you done? You weren't supposed to see this. You should go. Dad, no! No! Help us, someone, please help us! Protect... protect the innocent ones. No! No, Dad. Hey, stay with me, okay? You're gonna be okay. Just... Just stay with me. Stay with me, okay? Please, someone help us!
