First, I was born, which goes without sayin'. But even in the hospital, the day I arrived, I knew I was different from the other kids. I couldn't figure out why, at first. Then, suddenly it came to me! I was a rabbit in a human world. I soon displayed a talent for music. My parents gave me a toy piano to play with And I took to it right away. [Playing] When I was a little older, I was sent to dancing school. At school recitals, I was always selected to demonstrate various dances. [Panting] After graduation, I was ready for the big time. [Phone ringing] And offers poured in! Eh, this will never be a hit. After much consideration, I finally accepted an important part in the hit show Girl of the golden vest.
