-Manu! You calling it already? It's not even 8:00. -Ah, can't be late for my first day at my new role. What's up? -Yeah, well... don't let that promotion go to your head, Mister. -Pfft. My family, no chance. Hey. It's Mister Manager to you now. I am not calling you that. -Come on, give it a try. It's got a nice ring. -Just... don't mess it up, Mister Manager. - See you. - You too. -Aloha Kakou. It is our great honor to welcome you to our new family-run resort. One that we have blessed to take over. Mahalo nui. -It is our mission to keep the small, boutique resort alive and well on our island. And it is our honor to celebrate that with you. So... without further ado, e komo mai! -Noa. Why won't you let me help? -You're too small, Manu. You gotta wait until you're big and strong like me. -Who says? -Mom and Dad. -See? You need me. -No, Tutu needs you. She's looking for you. -Tutu, Noa said you wanted to see me. -Manu, come child. -Did you know that the spirits of our ancestors are in every leaf and flower? That is why when we take care of the land we honor our ancestors. In return, they gift us with mana, which is a special kind of wisdom and strength. I can already see that in you. -Then why won't they let me do anything? -Maybe what they're doing is not for you. -But I wanna help. Don't worry, ku'u keke. One day you're gonna be expected to do a lot of things around here. -My prediction... the sample's gonna test cleanest it has in 10 years. Then we've done our job and then some. -Why do I feel like I'm sending my kid off to college? So proud, but... a little misty. Just not used to leaving before the final results. -'Cause you're an eco geek who has a hard time unplugging. -What are you talking about? I'm barely on social media. -From work. -Oh. Well, that may be true but that's freelance. Gotta take the gig when it comes. -Doesn't look like our work is gonna dry up any time soon, sadly. -Did you just make a water pun? Unintentionally. But yes. -But seriously, you know I'd never normally cut a job short if it weren't for my best friend's wedding. -I know. -Are you sure? -Considering you've said yes to every project I've offered you in the last... what, five years? -Give or take. -Without a proper break? Yes, I'm sure. -Okay, good. -Now go. Relax. -This is my first time being a Maid of Honor. You really think it's gonna be relaxing? -In Hawaii? Yes! Everything is relaxing. Provided you get there on time. Okay, well you'll email me the results and keep me posted on our next gig? - What do you think? - Of course. I'm going. Alright. -You know what? I actually have plenty of time. Way more than I thought I'd have. So... maybe I could help pack up, follow you back to the lab? How's that? -Unacceptable. -What, why? -'Cause it's the opposite of island time. -Well, I'm not there yet. -You clearly need a head start. So... go! -Wish me luck. -Have fun! -Good morning. Aloha. Welcome to the Hale Hoaloha resort. I am Manu, one of your two resort managers. If you need anything during your stay, please don't hesitate to ask. - Okay. -Enjoy. -Hey Shrimp. -You know, I've been taller than you for years. You might wanna come up with a new nickname. -Kinda attached to this one by now, bro. Okay, well just don't use it where the guests can hear. Okay? Gotta keep it professional, bro. -How is your first day going, Mister Manager? -Oh, no complaints. Uh, just lots of ideas to run by you. -Ooh. And as much as I'd love to stay and hear all of them, I got bigger fish to fry. -Hey, at least you didn't say shrimp. -Hey! Hey! Hey guys, hey! -Sorry! You didn't have to wait, but thank you. -We weren't gonna leave without you. -Who knew there would be so much traffic at lunch? People... who actually take lunch breaks every now and then. -Well, I am here now and ready to help with any and everything you need. -Luckily for you we're actually good. -Seriously? I thought you said so much to do. -There was. But Michael jumped in like a champ, only mildly cursing my color-coded checklist. And Tessa and Cait helped out a lot too. So... we're actually in good shape. -That's great! Well, I'm so glad but I'm sorry I couldn't help more. -No, no. Stop saying sorry. You can't help your work schedule. I'm just glad that you took the rest of the week off. -Oh, you know I wouldn't miss it. -You missed mine. I'm kidding. I know you were out at sea doing something selfless and important. -Oil cleanup in the Gulf. -See? Important. -You better not miss my wedding. -Uh... -Wait. You and Levi are engaged? -Nope. I'm just giving you fair warning. -Okay, phew. I didn't think I was that outta touch. Oh, it's finally here. You're getting married! -On the beach! -In Hawaii! -So we all better be ready. 'cause it's time to get this party started! ♪ You know that I would do anything for you ♪ ♪ Come along to the... ♪ You know that I would do anything for you ♪ -Oh my gosh. -I cannot believe you're getting married here. -Stunning. Right? -Wow. -Are you talking about me? I have been working out a little more than usual. So... all for you though. I'll go check us in. -Oh, I love you, Michael. You're the best. I know. I know. -Uh... oh... -I know we've been doing a lot of band-aid fixes over the last few years, so... I came up with a list of upgrades, improvements, all priced out... -Whoa, whoa, Manu. Slow down, it's day one. -As manager. But I've been... I've been shadowing Noa forever. -Manu, we love your enthusiasm but now is not the time to talk improvements. -We just want you to focus on getting up to speed. -I can multi-task. -Ah, but the guests come first. -Okay, yeah. -Can you imagine how much water it takes to keep all this so green? -No. And neither should you. It's not like we're in the high desert. -Not a good point. -I know. But... no more work or work talk this week. Remember? -Yeah, yeah. -You're between jobs. -Hmm, not a relaxing thought. -For, like, a hot minute. So just try and turn off your beautiful brain and enjoy doing... nothing. - Right. Totally gonna try that. - Good. Oh! Just after this one quick email. Just really fast. Sorry. -Uh huh. -Hmm. -Welcome to the Hale Hoaloha resort. Would you care for a lei? -Yes! Oh! Hi. Uh... thank you for this. It's very pretty. Would you like some coconut water? -Oh no, I'm good. Oh, but speaking of water, I am curious. What are you doing in terms of recycling? -The... I'm sorry, what? For the... for the coconut water? -Oh, no. No. I just, I couldn't help but notice how lush the gardens and grounds are and I was curious about to note what you're doing in terms of water conservation. I'm sure it takes a ton to keep it up. Well, we are currently researching improvements that respect the fragile ecosystems of Hawaii. -Meaning? -You ask a lot of questions about water. -Oh, sorry. -Um, you know what? I... I need to get checked in. -Oh, I can help you with that. -Oh! Oh, you handle check in too. Okay. -I'm Manu, one of the resort managers. We run a relatively small operation so you'll be seeing a lot of the same people. First and last name please. -Sarah Gordon. -Will anyone else be joining you? -Well, that's a bit personal. Don't you think? -Just asking so I know how many keys you need. -Right. Um... just the one will be fine. -I have you in room 183. You'll find there's a nice view of the gardens. -You still have real keys? -We... do. -Oh, no. I just thought that most hotels switched that out years ago. -Oh, well... some people appreciate the more vintage, personal touch of a real key. -Ah. -But there's a suggestion box over there across the lobby. Feel free to visit it as often as you like during your stay. -I will. Thanks. I don't understand. How am I just seeing this? -It was last summer, Manu. This wasn't something to concern you with. -But it is concerning. -I agree. We've been doing what we can. -But it's clearly not enough. -For now it has to be. -Look, they'll be coming back in three months. Unannounced. And it's not just the rating, okay? We have a responsibility greater than ourselves. -We know that. But you have to remember that we're not a mega resort. We can't over-extend or there'll be no doors to open for them when they do come back. -So you just want me to ignore it? -No, Manu. We want you to focus on making this a warm and authentic stay for our guests. Keeping guest satisfaction up and the aloha spirit alive on our island. That's what we want. That's the job. -Okay. -So... let's get ready for the day. -Sarah! Sarah! Not good! Uh, this is so not good. -What, the coffee? -No. We lost our venue. -For the wedding? -No. Our rehearsal dinner. Okay, technically we didn't lose it, since I just discovered I never hit send on the contract email. -What did Michael say? -Nothing. I haven't told him yet. -Why? -'Cause. Well, then we'll both worry, and he'll worry about me worrying ‘cause he knows I want this week to be perfect. It has to be perfect. -Okay, it's gonna be fine. -It's once in a lifetime. -It's gonna be fine. Okay? Like, we will figure this out. -How? There's no time to figure this out. Uncle Lou is going to be here any minute, all the way from New York... and we promised him we'd golf and I don't even golf. So there's that. -Okay, okay. Stop. Deep breaths. Don't worry. Okay? I've got this, I could do it. -What, the rehearsal dinner? -Why do you sound so surprised? Okay, look... we both know that I am not the most experienced Maid of Honor, but I'm pretty sure it's my job to help. -Really? -Yes. I don't want either of you to stress. So just give me a budget and a headcount and forget about it. Okay? Yeah. I've got this. It's gonna be fun. You're lying. -Out of love. Just leave it to me. -Oh, God. You're the best! Thank you! -Right. -Hi. -Hi. -Quick question. -Is it water related? -I wish. Fixing that would be way easier. I'm... I'm looking for Alana. I left her a message but... -That's me. -You're Alana? -Uh... this week. Just handling events for my cousin while she's at a trade show. -Oh. Right. Well... Alana... - Manu. - Got it. -Any chance you could help me plan a rehearsal dinner super quickly? -For when? -Friday. -This Friday? For this wedding? -Yeah, unfortunately. A little planning mishap. Not on your end, not your fault, just trying to help a bride out. So if you could point me in the right direction or a direction that would be super helpful. -That's what I'm here for. -Really? You have time? -No. But I'll make it. Can't have the first wedding under my watch not go 100 percent. Even if it's not my mistake to fix. -Where do we start? -Wow. What did I tell you? You can't take a bad photo here. -You know, Michael needs to get a good shot of this because you look super official. -Smoke and mirrors are my new best friends. -Do you wanna come with us? -Golfing? Oh, you know what? Normally I would love to. Or at least drive the cart. But, uh... -You sure you're okay doing this? -I wouldn't have offered if I wasn't. So go! Tee off. - Thank you. - Have fun! - Hey. - Hey. -Uh... I already found one place that's available. My friend's mom owns it so I pulled some strings. It's a... it's a bit fancy. -Sounds promising. Uh, that's our bride. She's a little stressed. -I can tell. -Really? -Well, I work in hospitality. It's my job to understand people. You know, see what's really going on. So I can help. -I think what would really help is seeing that one place. Is that our ride? -No. Uh, the one place is not on the property, so... we'll take the tour jeep. -Oh, that uses a lot of gas. Never mind. I'll... reserve my questions for later. - Alright. - Okay. -The restaurant's a little formal but it's got great ocean views. -Sounds nice. -Yeah, it's just a starting point. -How long have you been in hospitality? -Since I was seven. -That doesn't sound legal. My parents took over this place when I was seven. -And you've been there ever since? -Yup. Just working my way up slowly but surely. -Wow, I can't even imagine that. Which part? Growing up on a resort, working with your family or clawing your way up from seven? -I didn't mean that at all, but all good questions. -That's okay. It's fine. Uh... I know I'm fortunate. It's a good gig. We're almost there. Great. - Thank you. - Thank you. Manu, this is super helpful. Thank you for arranging this. -Oh, my pleasure. -I love that it's all linen tablecloths. You know, it feels very wedding-y. I'm not sure about the orange but I do like the white tablecloths and the bird of paradise. Yeah. I mean, I feel like I know exactly what this would be. Let's book it! -What? It's the first place you've seen. -Oh, is there a second one? -Not yet but there will be. -Oh, well we don't exactly have a lot of time and I need to figure out the flowers and the music. And since I've clearly never planned anything like this before, I think it's best we lock it down. STAT. -So, you think it's what the bride wants? -Oh, I mean... sure. Right? What's not to like? It's elegant. It's pricey, but not too pricey. It's kinda perfect. Right? Though it is in the city. -You wanna make it special? -Well, of course. -Okay, then it's easy. -Easy? -Yeah. You know, just make sure everything feels personal. You know, all the little touches, the thought you put into them. That's what makes something special. -Thank you for placing that boulder on my chest. Hey, you asked for my help. -Technically... Alana's. You know what? I'm gonna do a quick check in with Lydia, and if she likes it, I'm booking it. -Don't stress, it's gonna be great. -What? -Nothing. -Nothing? -Look, I'm trying to, but... have you ever thought of switching this out or do you have a whole fleet? -Of what? -Tour jeeps. If you do, you might want to consider electric. -It costs a lot to bring cars to the island. -Right. Flight cost should've clued me into that. Sorry. Oh, but better yet, you could replace them with walking tours. Zero emissions. -Is this like a twitch? ‘Cause there seems to be no filter. -Hazard of the job. -Hmm. What job? -Ecologist. I mean, that's why I studied everything but I landed in... -Oh, let me guess. Water efficiency? -Ah. You are good at reading people. -Thank you. Now may I interest you in our zero emissions option for the trip back? -You do have an option. Oh, that makes my heart so much happier. What is it? Are you suggesting I walk home? -Just presenting you with an eco-friendly option. -Thank you. I know you didn't need to take me there so I appreciate it. -Ah. At least now you have an option. -Yeah. I'll get back to you soon. -Yeah. And, just so you know... when I said I couldn't imagine your life, it's just because we moved around a lot when I was growing up and now I travel a ton for work. I just couldn't imagine having a place like this to always call home. -Got it. And hey, uh... with all this stuff, just remember it's the little things that matter. -Likewise. -Ooh! Nice. See that? -Yes. -Honey? Manu... Sorry to ruin your day but there's a problem. It's the salination system. -Hello! Here's to a stunning resort, our gorgeous friends and island time. We are so grateful you are here. -To island time! To island time! -What do you mean on the fritz? -It's the salination system. We've got to replace the salt cell for the entire pool. -And you can't just repair it? -Afraid not. -So how long will it take? -With supply chain issues, it's going to be at least a week or two. -Two weeks? How soon do we have to do this? -It shouldn't wait. -I just wanna make sure there's not a better solution. -It's your call. But the longer we put this off, we risk a bigger repair bill and a longer pool closure. -Just give me a few days to figure it out. Hey, do me a favor. Don't tell my parents about this. I wanna take care of this on my own. -Okay, Manu. -I mean, it looks great. -So you love it? -I love anything you love. -I mean, it's wedding-y. -That is why I'm here. -What are we looking at? -Rehearsal dinner spot. -What do you think? -I'm happy with anything she's happy with. -And I default to you. -Excellent. -So, we'll see you in the morning? -Yeah. Bright and early. -Great. Oh, but I hope not. You're on vacation. Give yourself a minute. -Working on it. -I'm sure it'll be perfect. -Okay. -Quick question. -Uh, yes? -Is it possible to see just one more place? For comparison. Only if you can swing it. -Oh, right. Uh, good. Yeah, no problem. -Are you... are you okay? -For sure. I'm just dealing with a minor emergency. -Minor? -Worn out saltwater chlorinator for the main pool. -Oh. Well. -We're gonna have to close it for a bit. Immediately. -Ooh, that's not minor. Especially with a full wedding party. -Hence my stress. Any alternatives? -You know, I'm an ecologist, not pool maintenance. Right? -True. But, uh, you seem full of ideas. -I am. But, wait. Let me, uh... let me get this straight. -Hit me. -You wanna hear my opinions? I do. Yes. -You don't want me to just shove ‘em in a box somewhere? -Nope. Never. -Okay then. What about reverse osmosis? -Reverse what? -Reverse osmosis. I've heard about these trailers, they use ultraviolet rays and these giant membranes to clean pool water back to drinkable quality. So, if we could find one... -Well even if we could find one, uh, which is a big if, I'm sure it would still cost a fortune. -Okay, well you asked for my ideas and big problems need big ideas. -Manu. The painters just finished the east wing suites. Come and do our walkthrough with us before lunch. -Uh, I'm just helping this guest find her way to the spa. Uh... then I'll meet you over there. -Oh, well pardon us for interrupting. Enjoy your stay. -Oh, I'm planning a spa day, am I? -How fun of me. Hmm. -Sorry about that. It's just, uh... it's a little complicated with my parents. -What, working together? -Sometimes. They've seen a lot of smaller resorts like ours go out of business over the years. So, I get why they're cautious, but... things are starting to break, need repair, and they can't just keep ignoring the problem. -Why don't you just tell them that? If I'm gonna have any shot at them considering something other than the obvious, I'm gonna need hard numbers. -How about this? You find me one more option for the rehearsal dinner and I will get you some numbers. Make a case they can't resist. -Sounds like a deal to me. -How are the interviews going for the new head chef? -I got it narrowed down to three candidates. Uh, we'll schedule interviews and tastings for you and Mom over the next few weeks. - Nice. - Mm-hmm. -Hey. Sorry, I'm late. -Sit. Sit. -Did you get my email? -Uh, I haven't had a chance to check email in the last hour or so. There were requests from the wedding party. -And I saw you helping them make leis for tomorrow. -Tutu would be proud. -Yeah, well she spent a lot of time teaching me, so... I'm trying. After that, I'll need you to look after the gardens. -What's going on? -Liko spotted some invasives. We'll have to pull them out before they spread any seeds or pollen. -I'm on it. -Okay, bro. But, uh, can you get on figuring out what you want to order? Because, uh, we're all starving here. -Anything but shrimp. Okay shrimp. -Manu sent me a text. He found another place so we're gonna look at it first and then decide. -Is Manu the manager? -Yes. -Is Manu that manager? -Uh, yes. Why? -Ooh, no reason. He just seems really... you know, helpful and attentive. -Yeah, well I'm pretty sure that's his job. -Hmm... -And I offered to help him out too, so there's that. - You did? - Mm-hmm. -With what? -Nothing, just a little advice. -Work advice? -Uh... I'm sorry. It's just... habit? -Don't worry, I'm not mad. -You're not? -No. ‘Cause look at you. On your first vacay in like, forever. In a flowery dress with a plumeria behind your right ear. -Because that's where he told me to wear it. -Hmm. ‘Cause you're single versus taken. -Are you serious? What? -And I have been on vacation. -How many? Since grad school. -Well, maybe I am saving them up for a rainy day. Or retirement. Mm-hmm. -I know you love your work. But you might love vacations too if you let yourself just relax. Have you met me? Oh my God. -Fruity drinks for everyone. Huh? - Thank you. - Thank you. -You're welcome. - Cheers. - Cheers. - To you. - To us. Aww. ♪ Shooting stars in the sky ♪ make me believe we're alive ♪ ♪ We will see the world and lights together ♪ ♪ We will see the world and lights together ♪ ♪ Mountains of ice miles away. ♪ ♪ We will see the world and lights together ♪ ♪ We will see the world and lights together ♪ ♪ Shooting stars in the sky -You trying to impress Mom and Dad by being the last one out? -I'm just finishing up. -You good? -Yeah. Why? -Just checking. You're good at what you do, Manu. Just stay focused on the job that they're asking you to do. Okay? -Don't worry. I'm... I'm turning in soon. -These are tea leaves. They are native to Hawaii and are a symbol of respect, peace, friendship and love. - Sarah! - Hey! -Come on over! -That's okay. I'm too late. -No, you're not. You can join if you want to. -Oh. Yeah. Sounds good. -There's a spot right there. -Wonderful, thank you. Hi. -These are so fun! -Yay, can't wait. Mm-hmm. -Uh, don't worry, I'll cut yours up. -Great. -Just start with a couple of those. -Okay. -How we doing? So... Fancy is your pick. You sure? -Yup. -Okay, then I'll ask Hilani for a contract. -Mahalo. Ah... Wow, these smell so good. Not, like, super flowery where I just wanna sneeze for 10 minutes straight. Well that's probably good considering Hawaiian priests use those in weddings to bind together the hands of the bride and groom. -Okay. So that was deeper than I was expecting. -From who, me? -From a lei making class. -Oh. My grandma used to run this, so... I know a lot of fun facts. Like, you never throw a lei away. -You don't? -No. It would be like throwing away the affection of the person who gave it to you. -Well then that needs to be better advertised because I'm pretty sure the ones from prom didn't make it. But at least I still have the one from here. What am I supposed to do with it, frame it? -Uh... drape it. -On? -I don't know, a tree or a special place. -Hmm. -Or you could just throw it into the ocean. -The whole thing? -No. I don't know. -Well you could, but, uh... most people just crush the petals and let them fly into the wind. -Oh. That sounds very dreamy. Like I'm riding a horse on the beach at sunset. Or reckless like tossing dollar bills in the air. -It's just giving back to the land that created it. -Hmm. -Here. -Oh. -A symbol of friendship. -And it could also be a symbol of affection. -I think we're done. Mahalo. -Hey. I put calls into two places with the technology but I'm still waiting to hear back. Yup, that's island time for you. But a promising start. And I should have your contract later today, so... -Great. And then I just need to figure out the flowers and then tablecloths. Oh, and that thing called my Maid of Honor speech, which I've never done before. Okay, well then start by calling it a toast. Speech sounds way too formal and stressful. -That's the wise voice of experience. -Well, I've been in hospitality since before I could spell it. -Hm. -I'm happy to help with the details or, you know, listen in while you rehearse. -Really? -Although it might be a while. I have to pull up this nasty patch of invasive plants that are threatening the gardens. -Oh. That could take a minute. -Yeah. Maybe I should grab an extra set of gloves. -Sounds fun. -Fun? What? More fun than sitting poolside pretending to relax. -You are a rare specimen. -Instead of being fully present here I keep thinking about all the things that need to be done. -Hmm. At work? -In the world. -That is a mountain to think about. Especially when there's so much to be done. Just know you're doing a ton already. You can't do everything. Not alone. You shouldn't have to. Should I get you those gloves? -Let's go. -So, simple white tablecloths and birds of paradise. Safe. -If that's what you want. -That's what there's time for. -What about your toast? -Okay, back off. I might need to pace myself. You know, this would be a great place for a low-water impact garden. You could install a drip irrigation unit and then eventually use it to run the gray water from the kitchens. -So none of the water that gets used goes to waste. -It's perfect for watering plants. So, it's kinda like water recycling. -And it saves money which is what's gonna impress my parents. -Totally. Yeah, most people think eco- friendly upgrades is costly but normally they pay for themselves or more over time. -I think we've done enough. You? -Yeah. -Thank you for helping me. Pulling up weeds isn't exactly your standard vacation activity. -Well, I like working. It feels good to do something with your hands and actually see the results. Oh. Thank you. -Yeah, but you're in Hawaii. You gotta catch the aloha spirit. -I have. Okay, not fully, but I can definitely feel it creeping in. -You know what else I wanna introduce you to? -What? -Best food on the island, my treat. -Let me guess. Your restaurant? -Nope. -Your bar? -Strike two. Give me a hint. -It's a drive but a pretty one. -Ah... sure. Yeah. I mean, why not? I guess I just need a moment to clean up. -Oh, no. Actually I was thinking tomorrow, if that works? I've kept you way too long and there are some things I need to take care of here. -Yeah. Right. Of course. And I'm kinda tired, so... tomorrow's great -Perfect. Uh, I'll pick you up tomorrow 8:00AM, out front. -Perfect. - See you then. - Cool. -Bye. -Bye. Okay. I mean... maybe? -Oh, wow. Okay. So, this is the best shrimp on the island? -Best food on the island. -Oh... -I pay him to say that. What, they still give you a lunch break, huh? -I give myself the breaks now. Nice. Who's your friend? -I'm Sarah... and I can talk for myself. -I like you. Heenalu, this guy's best friend. -I pay him to say that. Okay. Come on, let's go see what you want. -Well this is your spot, I trust you. -Okay. Okay then, uh, then go grab that table and put your feet in the sand. I can do that. It was nice to meet you. -What? -Sarah seems nice. -She is. She's also starving, so... seriously. -Hey. - Ready? - Ready. -Dig in. -Mmm. -Mmm. -So good. -Does your friend always hook you up like this? -No. He just likes to show off to new customers. And you'll be happy to know his shrimp are grown locally. So, doesn't get much fresher than this. Do you have a thought in your head? -This place is kinda ridiculous. -Told you. -Not just here... Hawaii. I feel super at home, like I've been coming here my whole life even though I've never been. Although that shouldn't surprise me since I grew up near the water. -I thought you said you moved a lot. -I did. But my dad loved sailing so I always had the water to anchor me. -Hmm. Is that why you do what you do? -What, travel all the time for work? -No, uh... just the type of work you do. -It may be. Maybe, I'm not sure. I just know that no matter how awkward or shy of always being the new kid, I, uh... lose myself in hikes, swimming, gardening. Somewhere I always felt I belonged. -In nature. So, work for you is comforting. Therapeutic even. -I know, kinda strange. -No. Not at all. I mean, not to me. -So, what brings you comfort? -Ooh, so... we're turning this on me now. -I thought we were talking about you. -Can't all be one sided. -Well, that's true. You have dominated a lot of the conversation. -Hey! Yes! -Okay, okay. Alright, my turn. Um... though I might have to show you or else it might not make sense. -Do you have time to do that? -It might be stretching it a bit but I think it'll be worth it. You? - Do I have time? - Mm-hmm. -I'm on vacation, aren't I? -Okay. -Alright, I'm just gonna... Oh, you did not! That's bold. -So this... this is where I'd come as a kid. Whenever I felt awkward or out of place or admittedly left out as an over-eager kid wanting to please his parents. -Tide pools. -Turtle Cove. At least that's what we call it. Just far enough away from the resort where I felt like I could adventure, explore, not think of any of that. Don't get me wrong, I always wanted to be something, anything. I was so eager. But no, they'd always try to protect me from that. You know, feeling like I had to work just because they owned the resort. It's almost to a fault but I always wanted to work. I felt it was my kuleana, my responsibility and privilege, to take care of the property. -The resort? -And the island. -I get that. -I feel like you do. More than anyone I've ever met before. -Well, I feel like you get me more than anyone has in a very long time, so... there's that. -So, uh... this... this is where I'd spend most of my free time. You know, swimming, diving, tide pooling. Is that a word? -Let's go with yes. It's weird, I don't know the last time I went out on the water for anything other than work. -What? Really? -Yeah. -Then let's go! Where? - Out there. - Really? -Yeah. If you're lucky you might even spot a sea turtle. -Ah. Well, now that you put it that way. -You're game? -I think you knew I was before you asked. Come on. Well... come on. -Aloha. Hey Noa. Have you seen your brother? He's not answering his phone. -Not since this morning. Did you try his office? -When you see him, can you tell him to come find us? -Did you see those kids over there? -Yeah. -I bet I know exactly what they were playing. Same game we used to play all the time. -It looked like they were just standing still. -They were because the first person to flinch when something slimy touches them... loses. -Oh... wow. That's the game you used to play? -Mm-hmm. -How'd you rank? -High. -Of course. -And I always used to say it's because nothing scared me but that wasn't true. -Let me guess. Jellyfish? -Nope. My parents finding out I was sneaking around and grounding me. -Uh huh. Terrifying. -Yeah. -Should we, um... should we head back? -Yeah, probably. Oh wait! Look. We call the sea turtle honu. They're a blessing and mean good luck. Tutu, my grandma, used to say they're an aumakua. Like an ancestral spirit sent to offer you guidance and wisdom. Some say the honu are a living canoe that transports lovers to each other. -Maybe both are true. -This place is so magical. I think I just figured it out. -What you wanna say for your toast? -The rehearsal dinner. -Oh, I thought that was already decided. -Without giving it enough thought, but... the restaurant is beautiful, it really is. But, you know, it doesn't really feel like Lydia. What they're going for. But the day we just had... it does. It's all about connection. Right? -Yeah. Alright, well that's pretty easy. You sure? -Yes. Although music would be a huge bonus if possible. Otherwise I'll just sing. -I kinda like the sound of Plan B. -I'm kidding! -Thank you for coming with me. -Yeah, I'm glad we went. That was... really special. Oh! Looks like they sent me some numbers. So, um... why don't I go over them first? -Yeah. Uh, regroup in an hour? -Yeah. Uh, just send me a text when you're free. - Cool. - Great. - I, just... - Oh... - Oh, sorry. - No. - See ya. - Yeah. -Hey brother. Did you get caught up in the rain? -No, no. I made it back. -You coming back for seconds? -Nah. -You good? -What if nice was an understatement? -So, we're talking about the girl. -About Sarah. You said she was nice but what if she's more than that? What do I do? -You really don't know what to do? -I can't just ask her out. She lives in California. -I'm not saying it's easy but I've seen you go after what you want since we were in grade school. -Yeah, but that's work. This is bigger. More complicated. -Which is exactly why you don't stop going for what you want now. When it matters most. -Since when do you get all sentimental? -It was right after I found my Sarah. If you really feel something, find a way Mister Manu. Just follow your heart, brother. Talk later. -Hi guys. Can I borrow Lydia for a second? -As long as you join us after. -I will, definitely. Soon. -What's up? -I have some things to tell you and some things to not tell you. -Okay. -First, I figured out what we're gonna do for the rehearsal dinner tomorrow. -It's different than what we initially talked about and what you guys initially planned before the mishap but I think you're gonna love it. -I'm sure. What is it? -A surprise. -Seriously? Okay fine, fine. We'll be surprised. -Great. And secondly, I'm gonna be running around getting ready for that today and then I have some plans later. So you might not see me much today, but the next two days are all you. -And are these other plans romantic in nature? -Possibly. Then I support you. Go forth and make delightful choices. - I love you. - I love you. -Aww. - Want a drink? - Yes. - Cheers. - Cheers. - How many weeks is it? - It's a two-month job. The water allocation commitment is huge. -In the central valley? -Yes. Room and board is all handled of course, per usual. But it'll be pretty intense! -Sounds good. Important. Can I get back to you? -Oh... sure. When you're back is fine. -Thank you. And thank you for thinking of me. -Always. -Hey Sarah. -Hey. -That better not be work. -We only have two days left of vacation! - Oh, I don't wanna go. - Me neither. -Me neither. What? I don't. And it's not work, by the way, it's my toast. But you know what? I am not gonna overthink it. - No? - No. I'm just going to speak from the heart... and swim. -Someone's feeling island time now. Took long enough. -Hey. How's it going? Welcome to the Hale Hoaloha resort. Check in is right this way. Okay? Hey. How's it going, guys? I'm coming back for a reservation. Okay? Mom. Dad. Everything okay? -We need to talk. -So you knew what was going on with the pool. -I knew there were issues that needed to be addressed. -The saltwater chlorinator basically imploded. We have to get everyone out and close down the main pool. -What? Right now? I didn't realize... -Kainoa told us that he warned you that we needed to change the salt cell. -He did but I thought there was more time. I was trying to find a work around so we wouldn't have to close... and one that would be better. -For who? -The land. He alii ka aina, he kauwa ke kanaka. The land is a chief, we are its servant. I'm sorry. I was just trying to help. -Well your help is going to cost us twice as much. Maybe you weren't ready to move up to manager. -Kino. -I'm sorry. -Let's shut it down. -Sorry. Oh, they are going to be so surprised. This was such a good idea. - Good job. - I know. -So good. Oh no. Um... hi. Excuse me. -I'm so sorry, we've had to temporarily close the pool. But we encourage you to utilize the private beach or, uh... the kids pool. -Um... why don't we just go to the beach? We'll just tell everyone to meet up there. -I guess. -We're working as hard as we can and hope to have it open before you leave. -Thank you. -Thank you. ♪ Falling outside the lines. ♪ ♪ Open to what we find. ♪ ♪ Eyes on a different prize ♪ ♪ minds made up, can't compromise. ♪ ♪ The mystery is out of reach. ♪ ♪ I'm looking for what's underneath ♪ ♪ Holding on to keep the focus... ♪ ♪ We're catching fireflies. ♪ ♪ Shine a light on all the shadows. ♪ ♪ Jumping out into the unknown ♪ ♪ The mystery is out of reach. ♪ ♪ I'm looking for what's underneath ♪ ♪ Holding on to keep the focus... ♪ ♪ We're catching fireflies. ♪ ♪ ...We're catching fireflies ♪ We're catching fireflies -This is pretty spectacular. -And will be my one and only rehearsal dinner.

We're gonna go grab a beverage where the beverages are. -Hey. -Oh, hey. - I'm sorry about the pool. - Yeah, me too. I'm sorry you had to look into all that. But, uh, ideas for another time. -Yeah, for sure. You'll get it there. -Hmm. Will I? -Um... hey bro. They need you over at catering. When you can. -Sure. About dinner, uh...

Who's getting married today? -What time is it? -Well, you told me to wake you up at 8:00. So... morning! -You're oddly chipper. -Well, it's my job as your Maid of Honor. I'm getting married today. -What do you wanna do first? -Relax. -What? You can't relax, you're the bride. -The wedding is not until 3:00 so I think we need to grab our towels and head to the beach. Unless you wanna go find a certain someone instead. -Oh... that. Yeah, no. He doesn't... he doesn't need my help anymore. -You could just hang out. -You know, whatever I thought, it's not anything. Which is fine, you know, it's good. It's probably better. -Hmm. Is it? You've got such a big heart. I just wanna make sure that you get back all that you deserve too. -Right now you know what I deserve? A well-behaved bride who is willing to get up and ready for the day because it is all happening! I know I said you should try a different approach with your family but maybe that's the problem. You look at all of this through their eyes, trying to tell them what they wanna hear. But have you tried speaking from your heart? P.S. Thanks for sharing your beautiful home. Sarah. -To the best bride. -And bridesmaids. -We love you. -Fabulous. Come on, let's go fix your hair. Come on. -It's time. -I can't believe the next time I kiss Michael he'll be my husband. -I'm so happy for you. -I'm so glad you're here. -Me too. -Manu. What's this? -Ideas. Numbers. Things that will improve our resort. That need to be improved. I even consulted an ecologist, a guest who offered to help. -What's this about, son? -Our family. Since as long as I can remember, our family has honored our homeland, our ancestors. Tutu. But we've lost sight of that. Of just... talking to each other about what really matters.

Hi. Hello. I'm... I'm Sarah, the Maid of Honor in case you didn't know. Oh... come up here. Wow. I have... I'm sure you can't tell but I've never given a speech or even a toast before. I... I wrote about a million different versions of what I wanted to say, but... being here, seeing you guys so happy, so in love, best friends who take care of each other and protect each other from stress. It made me realize that's what we're all trying to do. Nurture all sides of ourselves, protect what we love and show gratitude when we find it. And then hopefully we can pass that love on. You guys have opened my heart with your love. May it surround you forever. - Thank you. - Of course. -To the bride and groom! Cheers! -Cheers. Let's dance! -Manu. Mom and Dad wanna see you. They say they got a project for you. -Let me guess, one you don't wanna do? -No. It actually sounds pretty cool. But you're the better man for the job. It was so beautiful last night and here. -Oh. -I'm not happy about this departure. -Somehow I think we'll be back. -Maybe for your wedding. Right? -But I couldn't copy Lydia. Could I? -Why not? I'd love an excuse to come back here. -Well then, maybe. Boys. -Noa said you wanted to see me? -Yes, come sit. We have a project for you. -Okay. -The cost and hassle of replacing keys, it's really getting out of hand. -And we looked at all of your numbers. We'd like to make the switch. -To smart locks with codes? -Mm-hmm. -I know it's an investment but I found a guy on the island who can manufacture the handles from 100 percent recycled... -Not just room keys, Manu. Your overall plan. - Really? - Mm-hmm. -We don't want another low eco-rating, do we? -We do trust you, Manu. And we trust that you're gonna ask for help when you need it. And as cautious as we've been, we'd like to keep moving forward in the right direction. -Mahalo. -Go. Make sure your guest has everything they need before they check out. We're proud of you, son. -Did you already check out? -Sadly, yes. -I wanted to bring you this. -I thought leis were an arrival thing. -Or a thank you. -For what? -Your note and your advice. It made a difference. They listened. - Your parents? - Mm-hmm. I'm sure it'll take a bit but they're open to our changes. Starting with getting rid of our old school keys. -Oh, that's a real shame. -I just wish I knew an ecologist who could, you know, help flesh out the whole plan. -If only. -If only you'd stay. - To help? - Sure. But, uh... even better, do a little sightseeing. Maybe take a hike to a waterfall. Make it a date. - A date? - Mm-hmm. I'd love nothing more. -Your timing is a little off. -I was afraid you'd say that. -But mine has been for years. Which is why I was just thinking about extending my vacation. -To stay here? -Well, not here of course. It would be a bit extravagant and complicated. Are you serious? You could stay longer, on the island? -I will need you to make some phone calls though ‘cause I need somewhere to stay. -I think I can make that happen. -Maybe some place with a balcony or a view? -Yeah? Any other requests or opinions? -Ah. -You know what I was thinking... -What? -We really could have had low-impact eco garden. -Gardening is what you're thinking about right now? -No. I'm thinking about where to take you on a lunch date. -I'm sure you have an idea or two. -For you... millions.
