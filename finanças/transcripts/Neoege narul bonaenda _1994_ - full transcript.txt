I was still at junior school when it started. My step-brother made me undress and do things... ...while he masturbated He sometimes made me help him. Once he tried to rape me while I was asleep I fought him off Step-father beat him and he ran away Mother kept telling me that... ...a woman should always give into a man So that everything will be peaceful Who is it? I'm from Seoul. I'm looking for someone. Who? -The Shinchun Literary Prize winner. Push off! I loathe journalists. Wait. I've had the same dreams as you. To You, From Me. Directed by Jang Sun-Woo I'm glad to see there's no dust on your typewriter. Writers who sit waiting for inspiration are losers. Shall we celebrate our meetings? The liquor could be better... At least you're not a heavy soju drinker. Real writers aren't drunks. Its good that you have no phone or TV set. I can sense your commitment. Same again please. She was so bold. As if she carried a warrant. So, what happened? What do you think is under my skirt? Wrong! There's nothing. Now you've won another prize. See if you like it. We were at it for more than an hour. A new record for me. Either you're slow to come or she's frigid. No way. Then she must have been very loose. Tight as a pair of jeans. -You think its a subway door? Tight mine once in a while. One hour for one climax? What do you think? Am I a better prize than Johnny Walker? Sure, I've never felt like this before. By the way, are you going to explain... ...what you said at the gate? It's exactly as I said. -Give me details! I won't blame you even if you lied. I had such a vivd dream one night I knew it could make a great story. I tried to write it for a month. Then I saw your prize-winning story You know what happened when I read it? I fainted. I really did. I felt better when they took your prize away... ...for plagiarising a foreign novel But you replied that your source was your dream. And I got dizzy again. You're no plagiarist I'm here to help you. Ma, that fridge sounds like an orphan... crying alone after the autumn festival. I always thought you'd become a writer. How so? You've always been a good liar. And you've always chased women. Isn't that a writer in a nutshell? If you touch me there... ...you'll always make me jump. Can you imagine how I got through school? A skinny girl like me with such a large butt? Graffiti about me in every toilet I can laugh about it now. Back then, I'd have sliced off these buttocks. I was treated as a slut, fucking... Is that word okay? Should I be more polite? Anyway, I became the champion of fucking. Slept with almost every boy in school. I started out the star pupil in that lousy school. By the end I was one of the worst. Next day Do sit down. There was a script-writer who got busted for dope We got the charge waived, and he did some work for us. But the jerk kept missing deadlines... Didn't even keep his appointments But he used our names when he got drunk we had to take him aside and teach him manners Afterward, he was our best employee Made me so proud We heard you have fresh ideas. Judging by some of this, we heard right. Oh, have you brought the text? Thank you. One moment... Here's your payment. Please check it. I'm sure its right. -Just sign this. Shall we celebrate our first transation? No need. Come on. I can't exploit your goodwill. Okay? -Sure. What shall I wear? This isn't what we need at all! It should be as clear as a neighbourhood newsletter. ''Democracy is good, Communism is bad.'' In good black and white terms. What are you saying? Come on Mr. Writer, stop showing off. This will prove what a fine citizen I am. Anyone reading this would think me an idiot. You can mail it to me. Are you upset? No, I'll do it. This piece could earn me a promotion That's why Im so anxious about it. You know, I used to write 300 pages in a night. What's so funny? Get up! Stand up, you fucker! Headcrash! Didn't you do military service? Atten-shun! At ease. Atten-shun! Head crash, you son of a bitch! You fucking greenhorn! That's better, straighten up You little scumbag I sacrificed my youth for my poor brothers And my university was as good as yours! You're early. - I want to clear my tab. Did I ever nag you about that? Alright, its 625.000 Won Call it 600 000 Here, keep the change for next time. So, what are we celebrating? Let's drink a toast. You're back early! I'm cleaned out Here. Don't spend it all. Where's he going? -To play pachinko. He's always running out of cash. But he brags to me when he scores a jackpot. isn't he adorable? See, he solves it in no time. Is Lee Jung-Bak there? -Jung-Bak! Jung-Bak! Telephone! Sleeps all day, gets calls at night... Why doesn't he get a job? Your turn, cousellor. Counsellor? Didn't Lee Jung-Bak tell you? The Committee has appointed you Counsellor. Committee? Is this a formal meeting? Nothing formal, just a get-together. Mr Hyun and I are agreed. ...on the need to revitalise our folk culture. Just a small group of us to begin with. We'll add specialists as we expand. We'll show the world! That's why we need your help. Let's welcome our new Counsellor. All together... Cheers! Time to strip, girls. I'm having my period. Turned coy on us, huh? Never mind, we've seen you before. Miss Min, the stage is all yours. I'm new here... Don't give me that crap. We're this joint's best customers. You want me to undress you? Here, will this do? I'll do it myself. -No, I'll do it. There's a good girl. Close the curtains. -What? Okay, is that better? You have lovely skin. Call that a strip? Take the rest off! That's better. Are you alright? Don't worry about me, go back inside. I'll tell you the truth. That magazine that Mr. Hyun runs... is a scam to rip off housewives And Mr. Baek's Repertory Theatre Company... ...is a cover for sexual abuse of schoolgirls Baek is a notorious sex offender They say he's even abused primary school kids. Then why the hell are you with them? You're working as their secretary! So when's your book coming out? What? My editor's going to look at it. Then where did the money come from? That's for the piece you wrote. You're hiding something. How could I hide anything from you? Then why can't I see your manuscript? Are you keeping it locked away forever? I told you: when I'm satisfied with it Alright, let's drop it. But how come you got so much for such a little? It's not as if you're a famous copywriter. Come clean, or I'm packing my bags. Bring me some water. I warn you, I'll leave. A company president was supposed to write that piece. A friend of mine in the company asked me to ghost it I guess my friend talked them into paying well. I'm supposed to believe that? Fine. But promise me: no more writing trashy stories. And no more outside jobs. Okay, just give me some water. By the way, can you rewrite the piece? Why, don't they like it? Sure they do... We'll, I've done all I feel like doing. They just want it a bit more in their own style. Then tell the president to write it himself. They repaid now, its not our problem. We can't say that when they paid so well You could have give me more water. Change this for 1000 Won notes. Change this to 500 Won coins. Look here, I'm busy. 500 Won coins. Change them for 100 Won coins. Change them for a 10,000 Won note. A 10,000 Won note. Keep the noise down! One day this teacher who had his eye on me... ...took me to a hotel He wasn't married and he was quite popular So I didn't mind undressing in front of him But that pervert turned out to be into S&M I even had to... Take a rest... What's wrong? You promised to leave me alone to write Sorry But you look so tired! Take a break, okay? Wanna play? What? Sit here. Let's pretend your book becomes a best-seller. And you're invited on a talk-show. Bullshit! Come on, use your imagination. Let's give it a try. Some reporter will fire questions at you. How would you describe literature? Do we have to do this? What is literature? I dunno... isn't it telling the truth? Why do you write? I dunno...I guess to find the essence of truth. What's your defitinion of great literature? I dunno... it has to do with the truth. Then what is the truth? -The truth... is truth What is wrong with you? That's how big-name authors talk. Where's your honesty and integrity? I really don't know. One should always be truthful... People will think you're a moron. This film, which starts in a lonely brown mood... ...is not a gangster movie. It's a modern apocalypse Panic, disability... an allegorical statement An epic that foresees a world without guns. Clyde only had one gun. A phallic symbol, of course. On parole, he found himself impotent. It was his gun that Bonnie loved, not Clyde himself. They went to rob a bank... And found it has been bankrupt for three months Funny, huh? Even the bank was impotent. But the phallic symbol did its stuff. What will it be? A beer Later Bonnie asked Clyde what he'd do... ...if he were free and the world were peaceful Clyde answered without thinking Bottle opener 'Find another bank to rob' Bonnie's face was indescribable. She was in despair. You know why? She'd begun writing poetry. That was when Clyde's sex-drive came back Imagine, the two of them rolling in the grass... ...a sheet of poetry fluttering beside them The gun turns to poetry and poetry turns to sex. This foreshadows their deaths. Not common or garden deaths, but ecstatic deaths Ecstasy Calm down! Don't cry, honey What'd you think you're doing? Change this for 10,000 won notes. Why me? That fat cow, I should have clobbered her. Why? Why? Cool it, that kind of shit happens. I'm sorry, it was that Jim Morrison. Goddammit! 'Why do people write novels?' To know... what their neighbours are thinking. To find out if others struggle with desires. and guilt, or with feelings of inferiority. Its like looking through a keyhole. That's what today's readers want from novels. So, you've stopped toying with the word 'truth' Wanna hear it? Stop it! Time for my reward. -Wait... Stop it! What do you think about 'best-sellers? They have nothing to do with selling out... But, what about blatant 'money-spinners'? I find that all art forms are commercial. But very commercial books have a short life-span. They get mired in compromise... 'Novels'... -I haven't finished! Even their fresh starts lead to compromises. Happy endings, moralistic resolutions Will the novel die? As long as there are readers, there'll be novels. And vice versa. Of course, visual literacy is replacing literacy... Maybe the key question for novelists is realism... Turn over! Get on the bed. So much rain. But I love rain. Shall we get wet? Let's go! Done it. You're brilliant! You're so cute. I love you. I lay down for him but he craved pain. I began hitting as hard as I could. He screamed with delight... ...and we found peace. My husband brought friends to the house. He wanted to have group sex, American-style. So, there was more peace, more, more Peace...Peace Come in. I'll take that. He's gone out? He'll be back soon. He'staking a walk. Dry yourself. Do sit down. Coffee? Juice? Anything. No, make it coffee. I like the sound of water boiling. The sound of water boiling? A special memory? At high school, I lived in a boarding house. It rained for days like it is now. I was tossing and turning in the middle of the night... ...when I had a sudden vision. And then it was gone. I started playing with words... I'm a lamp with no light. I'm a window with no light. I'm an alley with no light. I'm paper with no light. I'm a fireplace with no light... a pen with no light. I write on paper with no light... with a pen that has no light... filled with ink that has no light I close my father's lightless eyes with a lightless hand. Mother cries, lamenting the fireplace without fire. Lightless fireplace. I'm a lightless fireplace. I'm a lightless penis. Are you alright. I'm so sorry. Don't worry, I'm anemic. Are you crying? -No. I want to hear the rest of your story. What was I talking about? Memories of water boiling. Wait, I'll bring your coffee I filled a pan with water and put it on the stove. After what felt like a century, it boiled. I so much love talking to the boiling water... You're a very lonely person. Its getting late... I lent him a book. Which book? Shall I look for it? What are you reading? You forgot to lock the door. Two cups. You had company. Why don't you look at me? Don't touch me. No! I said don't touch me. -Why? You know why. -What do you mean? You stole those interview answers from this book. How could you lie like that? I can't trust you. From now on, show me your work every day. Otherwise I'm leaving, understand? The Kyungsan Cultural Commiittee visited my place. They brought cognac and two pounds of beef. We're talking archetypes here. No argument. Fraser calls it The Law of Homeopathy... ...or the Law of Contamination. Ethnographers call it the myth of the young geisha. Or, to bring it up to date, chicks I think the current word is 'babes'. Right, a babe is one up from a chick. Have siome watermelon. Thank you. White men seek to defy the process of aging. ...the myth of the 'chick' will endure. Gosh! Now I know why he ran away that evening. He was rushing back to you! Lick my spoon. Spoon? Come on, you're no beginner. I love this smell. Quick! I haven't smelled this in a month I just knew that you yearned for a real man. Quick, like this. This is the best butt I've ever grabbed. So everyone says... but be gentle Why stick with him? He's a plaguarist. No, he isn't He's finished 'can make you famous. How? I'll find you a good script. And then? You'll show off that incredible butt. You'll be a star. Really? Wait, I'll wipe you down. Visit my theatre, okay? Nice view Great evening I had a great time Great neighbourhood. Babes! Fancy a nightcap? I need the other direction. Why didn't you go with them? Hold on a moment I want to show you this book. What is it? -Look inside See? -'Towards Self-Reliance' Where did you get this? In front of Kyungsan Station. All their porno books had Communist-style titles. Such as? For Marx, 'The Inevitabilirty of History' What do you think its all about? Maybe this is your work. You miust be kidding. What kind of man is Mr. Baek? I don't know him, or Mr. Hyun. Then why did they visit our home? Who knows? I dislike them. What about his Repertory Theatre? Is it big? Not as far as I know. But I heaed they used to be famous in Seoul. I'm tired... Let's go to sleep. Pick one. They're good books. How much is that computer book? -5000 won. Is it understandable? -Of course. Who reads this stuff? -Everyone. You call these books? They're 3000 won, but I'd take 2000. Okay, 2000. Thanks You know that guy? No. Lee said they were ideological texts. But this is about folk remedies. Hey, you. Do I know you? It's me...Me! Remember? I don't think so. Stop pretending you fucker! You sonofabitch! I tell you to rewrite and what do you give me? 'The South Korean government's extreme... ...measures to control the reunification issue'. ''And 'Revolution from the bottom?'' Where's the fucking bottom? I sent this up without checking it. Guess what happened? I got canned! You're going too far. Her line 'from the bottom' was so moving... ...that I ran home to her. Drinking coffee? Are you going somewhere? -Yes. Why? What happened? Why are you writing trash like this? I wanted you to be a real writer. I didn't write that, believe me. Who are you trying to kid? Forgive me. A man came by, said you got him fired. If he hadn't told me about this Its disgusting! Forgive me... I can't live without you. How can I trust you? Liar! I've never lied. You don't think I... Yes, maybe you are a plagiarist You've got me wrong. Didn't you have the same dream as me? It's over between us. Don't go, you're my first woman. Please, please don't go. Give me one more chance. Will you do as I say? Yes. Put this back. Lick me Not there...first my feet. This is what I ran home to do. That's enough! Come up. You have to promise me two things. First, do some real writing. Second, break that contract to write porn novels. Agreed? But those guys are scary. Just leave them to me. Now, lick my butt. Can you rim me? As long as you don't fart. Now the real writing begins. You're late. I have to get through these today. Bananas I've eaten. Have some and give me the peels. Why? Have some bananas and give me back the peels. Thanks. What's with the peels? I've found it at last. What? Its in this book. New Sorrows of Young Werner. Bananas peels dried for six months are hallucinogenic! Can't be true! You don't trust Goethe? The book says it works. Eat and give me back the peels. It's illegal. Dope might be illegal, but not bananas. Eat and give me back the peels. You think it could help me write? If this works, I'll quit my job at the bank. I'll make a lot of money. I'll show these assholes. You bastard! You think I'm too old and rich to make love? Well, you're right about the rich part. We're just eating bananas... Just a misunderstanding. I don't know why you did that to my friend. If you do it again I'll write a story about you. Better yet, a news report. It was a misunderstanding. Really? Do you know who he is? An author, a prize- winning writer. It was a misunderstanding. Then explain it. -I want to compensate you. I just didn't want to rush you. A friend of mine runs a hospital. I can't believe I did that. What's wrong? You're always worried about something. Leave it out... Did you finish the bottle? -What's the matter? Its disgusting... Using my writing to blackmail a guy. Let's go....go.. Coffee. You don't mind me seeing what you're writing? Why doesn't this get hidden like the rest? Its a letter to the newspaper delivery service. What for? When I started subscribing they promised... 2 months free and then a bill for 3,000 won. Now its 5000 won. I'm complaining. At least its not plagiarised. -What did you say? Have you gone mad? Give it to me! Like the look of it? Come in. Anytime you need a new miniskirt... I brought home some money. I think we need some time apart. I'll stay here while you go away to write. More rice gruel? You want to...? No. That's it! Forgive me, God. If this works. I'll go to church. She's addicted to miniskirts. But I call her 'the woman in trousers'... ...after a poem I found in her suitcase. The woman in trousers stands at the weaving machine After a lunch of black rice and soup... ...she's back at work, asleep on her feet I've never screwed under a spotlight before. You won't leave him? You just have your fun. But I can make you famous. Was it expensive? Not really. Have you heard from him? Not yet. Come over here. What story will you tell me today? Lets reveal our innermost secrets. Sounds good but you go first. I'll tell mine when I've judged yours Can't expect a lady to tell her secrets first. You slut, who fathered these kids? The strange thing was... ...she never cried out while he beat her. At first I felt sorry for the woman Then the feeling turned to love. The sight of her doing the laundry... ...captured my adolescent heart. I lay awake all night thinking and then wrote her a letter. My first love letter. Wrapped in plastic to keep it dry... ...and put it in her clothes basket. I waited for three hours in vain. I wanted the earth to swallow me up. So, what happened? Two days later, he beat her again. I was so afraid, I had to cover my ears. The husband thrashed her with a pair of tongs. Over and over again, the bastard. Don't say a word, just hold me. You want me, don't you? That was the first time we slept together. Can you imagine being intimate... ...with a woman just beaten by her man? Hardly an everyday experience. She was bruised to the bone. My every move made her moan like a child. It felt like committing rape. Or rather, like entering a virgin. I stopped seeing her... ...before I graduated and moved out. But I found I had a venereal disease. And that left me impotent. But I heard you're in the red-light district regularly. Sure, but the reason I go there... is to visit the second-hand book stores. To look for books on VD and impotence. That's my secret. You really can't get hard? Really. Lie on the bed, let me try. You're taking too much trouble over me. I'm sorry, I haven't helped at all. I've paid women to do that... ...but no one ever tried as kindly as you just did. Now, how to you rate my story? Ace! Impotence must be a man's worst fear. So, whats your innermost secret? Started living with a guy when I was 19. Who was he? Arrogance and Compassion. Its a quote from Peter Berger. He had so many aliases, never knew his real name. A typical intellectual. ''I know the truth, ergo I save others'' You wrote 'The Woman in Trousers'? This is your poem, right? You must work in a textile factory. No, I assemble bikes. I like your poem. The best poetry reflect first-hand experience. It's grounded in realism. Actually I've never woven anything. How does that square with realism? You raise questions of labour and welfare... ...through the eyes of a woman worker In the bathroom, the sighs at her poor legs. Or the line Eating black rice and soup. But you also express working-class romanticism... ...and your realism embodied optimism. As in 'She weaves beauty in her blue clothes' That's not what it means. Its about a woiman's wish to wear a skirt. I see. You're dissatisfied with yourself, right? You want to exchange your blue uniform for a skirt? You want the attention of men, right? You're right. I certainly want to transform myself completely. Bring me a coffee. No sugar or cream, just black. Can't you do it yourself? I've been on my feet all day. Its your inferiority complex... ...that makes you read crap like this! What are you doing? Stop it! Where are you sticking that... Death to Fascism! I'm not a fascist Down with the Americans! -I'm not American! Die! Die! Good. Now swallow it. Goes down easier than black coffee. You little slut Have you gone mad? Eat! You'll starve yourself to death. After that I suffered from bulimia. I refused to eat. My father paid my hospital bills... ...on condition that I leave him. Arrogance and Compassion went home meekly I lost myself in reading books. And then one day... This prize-winning novel matched my own dream. And gradually my bulimia disappeared. She told you all that? Never mentioned it to me. Are you staying for good? I asked if you're staying. Yeah, but not in that apartment Then where? 'Your aunt had heart attack -Motel Kookjae' When was this telegram delivered? -Last night. None for me? Your aunt has no children? No She never married? -I'm not sure. My aunt's an I.P. -What's that? A nickname. Meaning? -International Pimp. You scared me. I had to get you here somehow. Are you together? Who is she? My fiancee. Seems charming. You're really not well. Are you in pain? You'll have to stay here with me now. You promised you'd take care of me if I got sick. Then no more sending girls to the rooms. How else could this place earn a profit? No, promise me. Promise me. She's still alive? Nothing from her in ten years. She isn't well. She's been good to me. Who's going to control the girls? I've put a stop to all that. Faulkner said a brothel is the best environment... ...for a writer. And Ko Un only became a poet ...because he once wrote letters for prostitutes. You're in luck. Room 201? Okay. Please go home, I'm tired. Not just yet, okay? Shit, you're getting on my nerves! What a jerk. They must be planning a skyscraper here. He could have given her what she wanted. Maybe he's impotent. Come here! What were you doing in that room? I took him some water and a towel. Is that all? What else? Tell me! Why is your lipstick smudged? -What? You don't have sex with me anyway. Smell me and see. That old man was lonely, so I kept him company. Why are you giving me this crap? You just like to stare at my butt. Well, take a good sniff. Any semen? You eunuch. Stop it! Auntie Auntie! One day an advertising man came to the hotel He fell in love with her and promised her fame So she ran away with him in the middle of the night What are you going there in the dark? I found your typewriter in the bin. I've given up writing. Really? What are you going to do? I'll look for her. She's the only woman I've ever loved. I see... but who'll run this place? I'll close it. Why don't you let me take it over? Sure, why not? Is that Entertainment News? Can I speak to Kim Dong-Ho? The guy who wrote that piece on Chung Sun-Kweng. Fancy a threesome? Same price as a one-on-one. No, I have someone I love. -Mister... Come in. What are you doing? I rescued your typewriter from the trash. Looking at it made me want to write something. So, I got one for myself. What are you typing? Something like a novel. It's either a novel or it isn't. Its just something to read, see? No. Actually, I don't know the difference myself. But its more like journalism than real writing. No deep emotions involved. No great world view, no inquisition of humanity. Don't look, its bad. Say hello...he's your pimp. What's your hobby? My hobby? On rainy days, I read my fan mail. Evenings, I like dancing in high-class nightclubs. Does that answer your question? -Yes, thank you. We'll take one more call. -...Hello Tell us your name and where you're calling from. You had the same dream as Ms Chung? Hello Now I'm working for Ms. Chung Sun-Kyung, the top star. Don't despise me for giving up writing. I carried her bags before she even became an actress. I was fated to do this. How lucky I am! Where are you going? None of your business, dickhead. Mind what you call me... I'm a bank robber. I feel like robbing a bank today. I quit my job at the bank. My novel is out soon. I never dreamed I'd become a writer... ...But this is my new profession. I'm moving to Seoul... So I have to give up running the motel. I've handed it over to the two girls you brought in. I wanted to depict our uncertain lives today. I was intrigued by the notion of flux. A bank clerk becomes a novelist... A writer becomes a chauffeur... A factory girl with large buttocks... ...becomes a famous actress. Is the book drawn from life? Of course, but it goes beyond mere observation. Critics say your characters are immoral and sick. It wasn't easy to write such characters. But as I said, they're based on my own experience. I can't be held responsible for them. Some say your book depicts the sickness of society. The changes in our value system. What's your comment? I'm flattered. Your book has some formal rough edges. I was reminded of Adorno's comment... ...that systematic and rational language... ...shoes up social inequalities and divisions. A counter-capitalist strategy of fragmentation... ...may be needed. Do you have such a strategy in mind? It would be nice to think so. But I'm afraid it just reflects me inexperience. ''Nice things make the world go round'' ''The nicest is money... money...money...'' Thank you. Where are you living? I'll see you soon ...thanks. Still can't get hard? From from it...the penis rises with the pen. How is he doing? Okay I haven't sent him a copy. Can you give him this one? Sure, he'll be delighted. Any message? Tell him to bin it when he's read it! Why don't you start writing again? I'll rent you a quiet condo to work in. I don't care how long it takes. I'm happy as thing are now, Madam. I don't want to dream any more. I can't go back anyway, but I only live the way I choose. Maybe I couldn't find my dream in this way. However, everything goes the way it is!
