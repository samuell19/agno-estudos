(boys laugh) - Cool it, man! - Shit. - Shit. - This is a very serious matter. - Good, I like to be serious. - Three of your delivery boys are members of a break dance crew known as the Delivery Boys. - So, what's it to you? - Tonight, your Delivery Boys are going to face off against my crew, known as the Devil Dogs! - Here comes the serious part. - [Crony] He getting serious now. - So am I. - They're giving a 10 thousand dollar reward to the crew that wins. - That so? - Yeah, that so. Now, last year, the Devil Dogs was up to win the 10 thousand dollars just like this year we're up to win it. But we didn't win it last year. - Sorry to hear that. - Oh, so was we. The crew that won last year was called the Big Shots. - [Spider] Now, that's a picture of the Big Shots holding their check for 10 thousand and their trophy. (mumbles) - Yeah, we brought them along because they are going to help convince you. - Convince me to what? - You're going to find out right now. - That's Richie. That Bobby. That's Manny.

Say it ain't so! - Now they the Little Shots! - Cool it! - Shit. - I've got seven empty places in my trophy case, and Max's crew got seven guys in it. - What do you want me to do? - You keep your delivery boys from showing up at the contest. My guys can handle the other four with no problem. This is all a question of mind over matter. You see, I don't mind and they don't matter. Now, by putting our heads together, we're going to help your delivery boys to keep their heads together with their bodies, you dig? Irie, that's what we're going to do right now! (laughs) - Hey you, pussies. You ain't going to win diddly squat sitting on your behinds. - I feel an emergency drill coming on. - I feel a pain coming on. (speaks foreign language) - What he say? - Scandal says he's going to practice his moves out on the stage. You know, he's been hanging out under the bridge a lot with that guy Kenji. - Man, that dude Kenji got the freshest boogie moves. I wish he was in our group. Instead of... - I know what you're going to say. And don't say it. - So Conrad, don't move in your league. But he cares a lot about the D-boys. Wasn't it his dad who bought us the costumes? - Yeah, and wasn't it his dad who gave Max the job delivering at the pizza place when Izzie and Max's mom died? And they didn't have no bread. - Dang man, he can't help if he's blond. Don't be prejudiced man. - Yo, I ain't prejudiced. I like Conrad. But why ain't he here practicing with us, instead of getting down with that chick? (somber music) (music plays on player) - I know what the problem with you was. - What? - You weren't concentrating. - I know. I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking of you. - That was obvious. - Was it that obvious? - I've never had this sort of a problem with a guy before. What's wrong with me anyway? - You're a pig. - Pig? - A pig. - A pig, pig? - We're both pigs. - I'm getting out of here. - I'm a pig, too! Perhaps the biggest pig of all! I'm all confused inside. Nothing matters anymore. Except one thing. - Conrad. You forgot the board meeting downtown. Your father is going to be mighty pissed. - You know Babcock, I hate board meetings. No matter how I try, I'm bored with boards. - Why would you bring a girl to a dump like this? - Well, I've been to the Ritz Carlton. I've been to the Carlisle. I've been to the... - I know, I know, Conrad, you're bored. - I'm bored. - Yeah. - To be or not to be. That is the question. The question? Mind. Suffer. Slings. Arrows. - Conrad, don't you think you'd ought to be telling me where I've been taking you every night, for the past two weeks? - No. - Your father has been breathing down my neck! - I know, it's terrible! It's those cigars he smokes. - Why won't you tell me what you've been doing all these nights? - You might break under torture. - You're right. I would. I'm not brave. - Oh, stop the car! (tires squeal) - Hey, Ciucaferri, wait up! - To die, to sleep. To sleep a chance to dream. Aye, there's the rub. What's a rub? (mumbles) - [Conrad] Wait up! - What dreams may come must give us pause. - What's up, man? - What's a rub? - A rub? - Yeah, it says here, "Aye, there's the rub." - Oh, that's Hamlet. - I know that's Hamlet. Hamlet don't know how to talk right. - You know what, man? - What, man? - I think you're the best. - You, too. - You worrying about us because you care about us. - Damn right I care about you. It's a manager's job to care. - You're more than just a manager. You're like my best friend. You know something? I think you're the best. - Me, too, man, I think you're the best, too. - Joey's been acting weird lately. - Reading all that Shakespeare stuff. - Why he doing that, man? He Italian, not Shakespearian. - An education is an important thing to have, you know? - Your move. - Ah! - The moon, see through the finger. (exclaims) (hip hop music) - I told you I'd take care of everything. Look, I don't like this, but I'm doing it, ain't I? You just send your bozos where I tell you, and when I tell ya. And I after this, I don't never want to see your lousy face no more. - She's something, ain't she? - Yeah, you know who was here talking to her? I seen them together. Spider, and two of his Devil Dogs. - No shit, man! What was he doing here? - Better ask Angelina that. - Spider and those Devil Dogs. - Max, what's there to worry about? - Ten thousand bucks worry. - Ms. Belmont please. - Max is going to win. - Not if Spider has anything to say about it. Come on, Izzie, let's find out what's going on out here. What's all this I hear about Spider coming to see you? - Whatever do you mean? - Come on, Angelina. You know I treat you right. - Sometimes you do. And sometimes you don't. Who's that handsome specimen over there? - This is my brother, Izzie. He needs a job. You got one for him? - Dang man, you ain't getting no place like that. - Muscles ain't everything, you know. - They ain't? - No, brains are important too. - Not like muscles. - Brains are muscles. - You say? - Well, you see, the more you exercise your brain, the stronger it gets. If you never read or talk about deep shit and stuff like that, your brain gets flabby. - You telling me I got a flabby brain? - Think Izzie's going to get a job at Ben's? - Depends on Angelina. If she likes him then... - That chick is weird. - She's on level. She'd never do something to screw us around. - I don't know, man. Izzie's got the strangest effects on chicks. - This is true. Izzie sure does make girls act strange. But Angelina, she's well put together. No guy ever make her come unglued. - Max, got a delivery, Belmont, a penthouse off of Fifth Avenue. Now! - I'll take care of your brother Izzie. - See that Izzie, you've got yourself a job. - Max, go! - Way to go, Izzie. (hip hop music) - Check this out! Go ahead, now you try it! - Nah, nah, it doesn't go like that, man! You're too white, man. You've got to move like a Latino. Watch. - That looks like a square dance. - What's a square dance? ♪ All the men, do see do - Unhand me man! I don't do that kind of dance man. Let's get to it, man! My kind of dance. Come on. (buzzer sounds) - Yes? - Hi, I'm from Ben's with the food. - He says to come in and wait. - Sure thing. What's your name? - Me? Tina. I have to go back inside, but you wait here, and she'll be out soon. - She'll be out soon. This is going to be great! - [Speaker] Ooh, you better wait. Please, pick up our food. The dining room is upstairs. Up the stairs, silly. That's it. Don't be afraid. (classical music) My, aren't we gorgeous? Enter the room at the top of the stairs. That's a good boy. That's where we eat. - This is a big house you have. Where are you? - You'll find out. That's right. Now enter the room like I told you. Such a good boy. - This is a dining room? - Just put the food on the table. - OK, that would be 11 dollars and 42 cents, please. - Sit down, please. - Sit down. Where? - At the table, silly. That's right. Now take the food out of the packages, and put it on the place. That's fine. Now there's a wine bucket right near you. See it? - Yeah, I see it. - Pour wine in both glasses. Now close your eyes. - Close my eyes? - Mm-hmm. Close those beautiful, brown eyes. - I'm Elizabeth. - I'm Max. Are you on welfare? - On welfare? - I think it's so much nicer that way. (glasses clink) - Take a little cheese. Yeah, a little more. (mumbles) - They don't mind the blood. Just put the cheese (mumbles) OK, just fold it, right? Hey, how's the future citywide break dancing champions? - He's nervous. - I suppose you're not? - I ain't got no deliveries. I intend to meditate. - Where's Angelina? - She's downstairs in the store room. With a new recruit. - Conrad, if you win, what are you going to do with your share of the money? - I may dedicate a new wing at Bellvue. - What did he say? (hip hop music) - Let's go.

Who sees they get paid? - You do? - Damn right I do. That ain't all the trouble you got from what I be hearing. - No shit. - Spider up to some evil moves. Ain't you heard about it? - No. - You're gonna hear. Personally, I hope you whip their ass. But you won't. - What are you talking about, man? - How is it going, gentlemen? - The two dudes just go inside a few minutes ago. - Man, we're going to fuck those mothers up.

"He doesn't even take a bath! "Have you looked behind his ears?" (laughter) - What's the matter with him? - Ah, Joey's dealing with his nerves. - What are you so nervous about? - Break dancing ain't like boxing. - Pugilist snob. - I'm so nervous I can't see straight. - I wish I had a delivery to keep my mind off things. - [Angelina] Conrad, Conrad? Come here, please. - Conrad, come over here. - [Conrad] What you got, sweetheart? - You say it, but you don't mean it. - Sure, I do, sweetheart. You take real good care of me. I don't know what I'd do without you. - Oh, Conrad, you're so good. - I was a choir boy. Did you know that? - Conrad, promise me one thing. - Anything. - Promise you won't hate me? - Now why would I hate you? - I just couldn't stand to see you all shrunk up. - Run that by me again. - Sing to me, choir boy? - Later.

Did you rip off his box? ♪ Come on Delivery Boy ♪ Come on deliver your bundle of joy ♪ And be the giver of all I require ♪ You've got the food now ♪ Feed my desire - I can't wait all night. - I only got a dollar. - Put in change or get out. - You got change for a dollar? - I don't know, I'll look.

Can't you hold it? - I've been holding it. I can't hold it no more. - What do you expect me to do? - Anybody standing around? - No, not right now.

You gotta hurry. - I got to hurry? - Give me a couple of champagne glasses. - You must be... - Hurry. - You ain't kidding. - You better hurry, or there's going to be a flood. (classical music plays in background) - OK, I got the glass. - Take me out of this fig leaf. - Take yourself out of your own fig leaf! - I can't do that. Now will you hurry up! I thought you'd go for this sort of thing. Now put a champagne glass down there. - This is fun. It's like milking a cow. OK, ready? (pee trickles) Ah, so that's how it works. (moans) - Stop! It's full! - OK, get another one. Ready? - Ready! (moans) - Stop! Now this one's full. - Get another one. - Another one? - Hurry up, before they come back. - Ready? - Ready.

Close me up. - Here they come! - Thanks, pal. - Don't mention it. - [Guest] That Dr. Marchan hasn't the slightest idea about art. - I really found him rather amusing. - I found him terribly boring. (speak in foreign language) - My dear, would you mind fetching me some champagne? - I'm simply dying of thirst. - Ah. - Oh, thank you darling. - Quite all right my dear. - Did you know that Dr. Marchan was the museum consultant on that Rembrandt forgery brouhaha some time back? - Ah, he's the one. - You know, I think there was something terribly underhanded in that whole affair. - It's awfully warm in here, isn't it? - I think it's the champagne. It's warm and flat. - I swear. The art world isn't what it used to be. (rock music) (crowd cheering) - How it be, gentlemen? - It be fantastic. - It be magnificent! - What the fuck happen? - The little Italian boy done gone and broke a $30,000 statue, and is currently indisposed. - That blonde devil got a needle full of that blue stuff. Whoo! They both out of the question for the night. - They wiped out. - Totally! - They're in no-man's land! - Oh, shut the fuck up, man! - Shit. - Shit. (crowd cheering) - Ladies and gentleman. The hour has arrived. The moment you have all been waiting for. For weeks, you have been gathered here, beneath this magnificent bridge, to witness the battle of the breakers on a citywide break dance championship contest. Tonight, out of more than 200 crews who have many a competition, the two top groups, Max Ramirez and his Delivery Boys, and Spider and his Devil Dogs. Before the moment arrives, I would like to introduce you to the sponsor of the event. The man that made this evening possible, here's Mr. Arnold Goldblatt, President of (mumbles) Incorporated. Maker of those famous (mumbles) you guys have all been buying for your girlfriends, (mumbles) panties. Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Arnold Goldblatt. (crowd cheers) - For years, gangs in this neighborhood and others like it, have been killing themselves and destroying their neighborhoods with needless gangland rape, violence, and plunder. But now, now there is new hope for the young people of our nation's inner cities. This art, this new feeling of expression, for our young begins here with this new way of settling differences, and may I say with all due modesty... - Jesus, you've got trouble. - You ain't kidding. My back is starting to give. - Your mother's here. She's on the other side of the gallery. - Holy moley! She can't find me like this. It'll be the end! You've got to do something. - I don't know what to do! - You've got to hide my face. - Shut up! - Good evening, Mrs. Ciucaferri. You remember me? I'm Angelina, from Joey's job. You know, Ben's? - Yeah. How are you doing Angelina? - Oh, I'm fine, just fine. How are you doing? - I got this call. Something about Joey breaking a statue. - Somebody called you, you say? - Yeah, a man named Mr. Spider. - Mrs. Ciucaferri. This Mr. Spider, he's nobody you should be too concerned with. Your Joey ain't in any trouble. - You mean to say that Joey ain't here? - What I mean to say is... Holy shit! - I see something! I don't know what I see, but I'm gonna find out! (screams) He's my son. It's Joey! Of course I know that little ass. How many times I've changed his diaper! How many times I squeezed him when he's a beautiful child before he'd go crazy? How many times I spanked him when Joey do nasty things? (gasps) Look at that birthmark! How could I not see it! - Ouch! - Joey! - Joey? - [All] Joey? - Oh man, you in very big trouble. I go to sue you in the court for 10 million dollars. What your name? - Joey Fuck-a-Cherry. I mean, Ciucaferri. - And may I say with all due modesty, and to conclude these brief remarks, I am overjoyed and moved by what is taking place here tonight. Why it matters not which group wins and which group loses, for tonight, we are all winners! (crowd cheers) - [Spider] All right. Those two guys are missing by some stroke of luck for us! (team cheers) - Now what we got to do what we normally do, strut our stuff! This is the question of give and take. They're gonna give and we're gonna take. (team agrees) Now that green money that's theirs is ours for the taking. You dig? - We dig! - You dig? - We dig! (sirens) (hip hop music) (boat horn sounds) - Hey, Rodney! - Max, are you for real? - I want to know what's going on here. - Izzie told me that Spider's up to his old tricks again. - Who's missing? - Conrad. Joey, he's missing too. - Who do we have to substitute? - Nobody. - What you mean nobody? There's plenty of good boys around! - Everybody's afraid of Spider. They're doing a number, freaking everybody out. Hey, what's with the uh... - You wouldn't believe it, man. You got a change for me? - We don't got time. We're on in two minutes! - I need a pair of sneakers. - Here you are. - Thanks. Have Izzie meet me by the stage. - Izzie's over there. He's by the fence. (sirens) - You're dancing tonight. - You're crazy man! It's been too long. - Izzie, you don't dance, we lose. We ain't got enough without Conrad and Joey. - Been too long, bro. I ain't in shape no more. - Izzie, you used to be... - I used to be. A lot of things. - Man, you're my big brother. You're made of the same stuff as me. - Come on. You know that ain't so. - Look, man, I used to be proud of you. You was my big brother. You was the best! The best with the ladies. The best with skateboard. And it was you that showed me all I now about breaking. I owe you, bro. I owe you for everything I got. We the best. We need to be. Man, what else we got in this world? Man, I can't. It's too late for me. Then you're too late for all of us.
