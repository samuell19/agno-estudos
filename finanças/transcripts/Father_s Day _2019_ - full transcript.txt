[cheerful music] [chatter] Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, and sea monsters of all stripes, to the ocean famous sea stage amphitheater, where it's always nice to see you, but it's so much nicer to be seen. As ever, I'm your host Tony Loney. I hope you've got your fins on today, because this is gonna be a bombshell, blockbuster, barnburner of an announcement. As we all know that most marvelous, magical, manly holiday is fast approaching. Next Sunday is Father's Day! And in honor of all you number one dads out there, we're holding the annual deep-sea burp contest that day at noon. That's right, limps. So, everybody flex those blow holes and stretch those gills, because our annual ocean championship is up for grabs. And what better gift to give the beloved patriarch of your reef, than the deep-sea burp contest championship trophy? So, get cracking, crustaceans, and find your motivation, mollusks. Sunday will be here before we know it and a new champion will claim the crown and make their school proud. Bring your acid reflux anglers and we'll see you on Sunday. Wow! The deep-sea burping title. Just imagine it. That sure would spur a lot of opportunities. I bet you could get a full scholarship to any fish school of your choosing as Burp Champion. Yeah, it is what you make it, though. Just because you win a prestigious title, doesn't automatically make you the world's oyster. Just look at my dad. Oh right! I totally forgot he was the very first deep-sea burp champion way back when. Say, how long ago was that exactly? - A long time. - Right. Well, I'll bet he did lots of cool stuff during his time in the limelight. Not really. He just came back home, put his trophy in the closet, and watched TV. What? How was that possible? Did he at least watch himself on TV? No. My dad avoided the press. He didn't gill any interviews, fin any autographs, or paddle any appearances. He just came home. He's always just been my dad. Wow! What would you do if you won the title, Charlie? Me? I don't even know how to burp. There's time to learn. Are you going to enter the competition? - No. Why would I do that? - Because it's fun! And it's a unique experience. And you can do a lot of cool things if you win. Even if you don't win! Yeah, well, there'd also be a lot of pressure, just because of who my dad is. Who needs that? What about you? Are you gonna enter? I'm thinking about it. I've never burped either. Ha, I'm sure we'd be very impressive. Hey, Scroodle! What you up to? - Training! - Oh, yeah? Are you going to enter the contest? Enter? I'm gonna win! I've been burping since I was your age. Nobody can top me. Listen to this. - [burps] - Wow! You like that, huh? Don't sweat it, maybe someday you'll be able to float them like that. Yeah, maybe someday. Hey, isn't your dad... The first deep-sea burp champion, ever? - That's him! - Come on, Mucus. Yeah, wow! What's that like? It's like anything else really. He's just Pops to me. Right. That dude did squat with his title. All the champions after him became like celebrities, but not that dude. He just... poof! Disappeared. Well, he never disappeared for me. He's been a good dad. I'll bet. Kind of a loser burp champion. Nice to hear he's good at something. Well I'm off to continue my training, I've got this in the net, but that doesn't mean it's easy. The best of the best are gonna be there next weekend. Gotta be ready. Ta-ta to all of ya. Man, what a jerk. He's never won anything in his life! That's probably why he's so confident. He'll find out how tough it is on Sunday. My dad always said it was a real pressure cooker. Oh. You think your dad would want you to enter the contest? Don't know, we never talked about competing. He mostly watches TV and sleeps. Gotcha! What do you think he'd say if you won? [TV playing] - Hi Pops. - Hi, Charlie. How was school today? Pretty good. I got an A in Miss Barnacle's class. Oh, congratulations! How is Miss Barnacle? She's good. She said hi. - Do you know each other well? - Barely. We went to school together when I was your age. Wow! That was a long time ago. [laughs] Yes, a long time ago. Was she as cool as you were back then? Cool? Oh, I was never cool. Pff! You were the very first deep-sea burp champion. I'd say that's pretty cool. And I'd say it was a different lifetime, my boy. You mean, like an alternate dimension? Not exactly, no. I'll explain it someday, but not today. Oh, okay. Hey, you want to practice some burps? Burps? No, Charlie, those days are behind me. Besides, Crafty Fish is coming on. Crafty Fish? What's that? A new show where all the fish evade the fishermen. It's so great watching those guys get mad. One guy snapped his rod and threw himself right into the lake, ha-ha. Eh... I'll check it out sometime. I'm gonna play in my room. - See you later, buddy. - Later, Pops. Ladies and gentlemen and plankton of all persuasions, allow me to introduce the winner! Our new deep-sea burp champion... - Charlie! - [crowd cheering] Hey, come on guys. I didn't want any trouble. Well trouble's what you got, I suppose. Yeah, what are you going to do about it? Um, nothing? Can't... can't we all just get along? Ha, why would we get along when we could fight? And why would we waste our time competing against losers, when we could wipe them out in advance? Consider your butt whipped, loser. - What? - Wait, you know what I mean! Whatever. Listen up, small fry, nobody around here burps like I can. So, don't even think about entering that contest this weekend. Yeah don't waste your time. Okay, okay. I won't enter the contest. Pinky swear? I don't have pinkies. Oh, that's right! Hey, if you're not careful, we'll take your fins. Hey, you punks leave Mucus alone. Says who? Look, it's a champ's hatchling. His dad won the very first burping title. When? At the turn of the century? Yeah, back when they gave Megalodon thesis trophies. [both laugh] What are you two still doing in fish school? How old are you guys anyway? Not as old as your dad. Yeah, ha-ha! At least Charlie's dad cares. Yours took one look at you and swam for the hills. - Why, I ought to... - Cool it, Rip. We don't have to fight all the time. We got all the friends we need. We don't have to be friends to be friendly. By that logic, we don't have to be hungry to take a bite. Come here, Charlie. [bell ringing] Ha! Saved by the bell. You twerps better swim fast after school. We'll be looking for you. Chomp! Ha-ha-ha. You okay, Mucus? Yeah, I'm fine. Those guys are bullies. They sure are. But don't worry about them. Come on, we're gonna be late for class. [bell ringing] Hey, live bait. Still feeling mouthy? Oh, come on guys, give me a break. Oh, you want a break, huh? Okay, one break coming up. [burps] - Ow! - That's how it's done, hook holder. Yeah, go tell your old man there's a new champ in town. And his name is Rip! [both laugh] Hello, anybody home? [Rags] Charlie, is that you? You know it kid, come on in. Good to see you again, kiddo. To what do I owe the honor? I just thought I'd come say hi, Rags. Do I need a reason? No, you don't, Charlie. But I know you better than that. I can see the worry in your gills. - You can? - I can. You're just like your dad in that way, lousy poker faces. [sighs] I have a dilemma, Rags. A dilemma? I got medicine for that, you know? It's a little chalky, but it'll get you regular in no time. What? No, I'm facing a problem and I don't know what to do. Oh, is it dropsy? A little antibacterial fish food, and a couple of drops in your reef cave will clear that right up, kiddo. Gosh! Now I know what to do. Phew! Good. I mean, I know some good home remedies, but I'm no doctor. What is it kid? They just announced a contest to crown the new deep-sea burp champion. Ah, I heard about that. Boy it takes me back. It does? Do you regret it? Regret it? I relive it every day. Sometimes I act out that championship round against your dad right here in my cave, all by myself. Pretty pathetic, huh? What? No. It's just... Well, it's kind of pathetic, yeah. Don't buffer the blow or anything, kid. That reminds me of your dad, too. Brutal honesty. I wish that were the case, Rags. I'd love to ask Pops about this, but he just won't talk about it. Is it his weight gain? He's really ballooned these last few years. Must be all that TV watching. No, it's not that. It's... [sighs] I'm thinking about entering the contest and competing for the title. Get out of here! Is it stupid of me? Tell me, if so. I respect your opinion. - Don't. - Okay. That's all you had to say. I won't. No, I mean, don't respect my opinion. - What? - Respect your own opinion. Follow your heart kid. Don't ask anyone's permission to go for it. You think your dad asked anybody for permission to compete in that competition he won? We were your age! They didn't even allow fish that young to enter. We forged our papers just to get in. Nowadays, anyone can compete. Why wouldn't you? I don't know. It always seems like Pops regrets even doing it. Yeah well, your dad's a complicated fish. I'll say! Sometimes, I don't get him at all. Join the club, kid. I can't speak for him, I wouldn't know where to start, but I can speak for myself. They used to call me Riches, you know? Riches? So... I went from Riches to Rags. Now, I hear it all the time. What's up with you guys? I don't get it. Too much, too soon. Our ideas were bigger than our fins. We basked for too long and the ocean passed us by. Who knows? Me and your dad saw things differently, but we kind of handled things the same way. I never thought of it like that. Well, you should. Listen, I can't say I'm leading by example. I hardly leave my cave. You've got your whole life ahead of you. Don't do as I do. But if you need advice, I'll be honest. The contest is on Father's Day. Do you think Pops will hate me if I enter? Hate you? Kid, I've never understood a thing that old fish's done, but I know one thing as a fact, your dad loves you more than anything in this ocean. And that's not gonna change, certainly not because of some dumb contest. Thanks, Rags. Sometimes it's nice to put things into perspective. I just have one more question for you. - What's that? - Will you teach me to burp? Oh boy! Sure, kid. Thanks, Rags. Where do we start? Oh, let's see. - These cave walls? - The walls? Yeah, they haven't been washed in forever. You can start now. We'll talk after. Oh! Okay. You better swim or you're going to be chowder when we get a hold of you. That's right. We're gonna burp your skills off. What did I do? I already told you, I won't enter the burping contest, I promise! I need a practice dummy. Come back here, so I can hit you with some burps and rattle your little skeleton! That doesn't sound like much fun, Rip. What about those rocks over there? Look at all that algae. You could burp it to bits. Why would I do that when I can burp you to bits instead, small fry? Yeah! Ha-ha-ha. [burps] You call that a burp? This is a burp! [burps] Ow! Fatten your gills, shark bait. Now you're gonna get it! Stop right there, Rip. Jelly Fun, who invited you to this party? No one. I'm crashing. This is none of your business, sister. I'd beat fins if I were you. This is between us and the little fish. Unless that little fish is tutoring you, I'm making it my business. Tutoring us? You gotta be kidding. Oh, but I'm not, Barf. Everyone knows you've been trying to get a passing grade in school for three years! Two and a half! If you say so. Back off the fish and scram. And what if we don't want to? Then, I'll show you what a real burp sounds like. Ha! That I'd like to see. Have it your way. [burps] Ow! Holy mackerel! You still here? - Want another one? - No, no, no! I'll get you for this, Jelly Fun. Mark my words. Wow! You sure know how to burp, lady. You either got it or you don't, kid. - My name is Jelly Fun. - I'm Mucus. Are you gonna compete in the contest on Sunday? Nah, I burp for fun, not for prizes. That's pretty cool. I don't know. I'd probably be famous if I competed, because I'd win. - I believe that. - But fame's overrated. I'd rather be happy. Besides, everyone's famous these days on their social media matrixes. Oh, are you on Fishbook? I'll send you a friend request. No, I'm not on Fishbook or Critter or Crabchat. Don't you know? The worst thing that could happen to a fish is to find themselves online. Oh, okay. Wow. So, what's your deal, Mucus? Why are those guys picking on you? Oh, they pick on everybody, but especially me. They're trying to bully fish out of entering the deep-sea burp contest this weekend, so Rip can win. Rip? Pshh! Only winners, win. Rip's a loser. [laughs] Yeah, he is. Hey, you want to meet a real winner? Come with me. Um... okay! All right, Charlie. Now, pay attention. These creatures are practicing. You'll see what the competition's got in store, what they're thinking, what they're made of. Hey, I know this guy. His name is Broot! [burps] Amateur! [burps] Slightly better, but he goes home in round two. [clears his throat] ♪ Ah, la ♪ ♪ Ah, la, la, la, la ♪ ♪ Ah, la ♪ ♪ Ah, la, la, la, la ♪ Of, for Neptune's sake. [burps] Yeah! Woo! Woo-hoo! You got this in the bag, Tiptoes. Thanks, Mr. Sushi. Aw Schuck's! Please, refrain from using that word. - What word? - Schucks. It conjures unpleasant memories of my time in the Pacific. Oh, sorry, Mr. Sushi. It won't happen again. Somebody's sensitive. All right, Charlie. Now that you've seen what some of your opponents are bringing to the stage, you're ready for the next step in your training. I am? All right! What are we doing? Mouth gapes, breathing exercises, diaphragm stretches? You're going to weed the cave. Weed the what? The cave. You're going to weed the cave. It's terribly overgrown. And if we're going to continue, we'll need space. - Oh! - I set out some tools for you. If you could line along the cave's natural contours, that would be great. Oh, and don't cut down the archway flowers. I like those. All right. [Pops snoring] [snoring] What am I doing? I must be out of my mind. This is such a mistake. I can't win the deep-sea burp contest. It's impossible. If you want to know how those older fish can burp the way they do, Mucus, this lady's the fish to talk to. Wow! I can't wait. Do you think she'll even want to talk to a little fish like me? Will she want to? She'll be delighted! She loves instructing pupils. Pepperhead Firefly is the most talented sage in the ocean. She taught me everything I know. Wow! Excuse me, Miss Firefly. Yes, my child? Come closer and tell me, what is it that brings you? I've come back to talk and share in your wisdom. - Ah! - And I brought a friend. Oh! Are you going to introduce this friend? This is Mucus. How are you, Miss Firefly? Hmm, you are small, young one. Ha-ha, yes! He's impossibly small. Ridiculously tiny. Comically miniscule. Well, I mean, I'm not that little. Tell me, my child, why have you brought him to me? I want to learn how to burp. And we did these great mouths gaping exercises, and practiced burping from my diaphragms. I really got more volume. It was so awesome! That's great, Mucus. I'm really glad to hear that. Thanks, Charlie. What about you? How's it going with Rags? That fish is a legend. I bet he's teaching you so much cool stuff. Yeah, we're doing lots of cool stuff. Wow! I can only imagine. Ah, you probably wouldn't believe me if I told you. Man! Between Rags and your dad, I think you're the fish to beat. They live here. I thought this was supposed to be some kind of burping legends or something. This is like a regular neighborhood. Yeah, they think they're special because they live among the common fish. Trust me, it's all an act. - Which house is theirs? - Right over there. Come on! I hear that punk, Charlie, is training for the contest in secret. Once we kidnap his old man, we'll undermine his plans for good. Fintastic! He-he-he. Look alive, Pops. We're taking a little field trip. Oh, you're from Charlie's class? Sure, he can take a field trip. Do I need a sign a form or something? Yeah, we got a form right outside. If you just come with us, we'll get your signature, and be all set. Okay. Where are you kids heading anyway? Oh, some place close by. Sounds fun. Say, you fellas look a little old to be in Charlie's class. - We do lots of homework. - Yeah, it ages a fish quick. I see. When I was your age, we didn't have all that homework. After school, we went to the open water and played with the dolphins. Oh, great. Let's go, Pops. Get a move on. Okie-dokie, youngsters. Hurry up and show me where to sign. Crafty Fish is about to start. - You boys watch Crafty Fish? - [both] No. Oh, you boys are missing out. It's more fun than a bucket of krill, he-he. Been a while. It's like surfing. Once you know how, you never forget. [sighs] How can I teach Charlie if I don't do it myself? I got this. [burps] [Jelly Fun] Not bad for an old fish. Huh? Who's there? Hi, Rags! Jelly Fun! It's been a long time. Indeed, since your last competition, all those years ago. When I lost to Charlie's dad in the overtime burp off. You almost won it all! But I don't. So, what do I owe the pleasure? Oh, you still know how to flatter a girl. It's like surfing. - Huh? - Never mind. Word is you're back in the game. Word's wrong. Oh, so you're not training Charlie for the deep-sea burp contest? I didn't say that. Then you're back in the game. Does Pops know? Charlie wants to keep it hush-hush. Make it a Father's Day surprise. Ah, how's the kid doing? He's got skill, he just needs to believe in himself. - Just like his old man. - Ha! If there's one thing that fish doesn't need, it's more self-confidence. He's lost a lot of it, I hear. Maybe seeing Charlie compete will help him regain some. - About half would be good. - What about you? - What about me? - Are you getting the itch? Not since Charlie cleaned the fungus off my walls. You know what I mean. Are you tempted to come back? To burping? Ha! No one's called me Riches in a long time. Well, here we are. What do you think, Riches? Don't worry, old man. Just as soon as I win that burping contest on Sunday, we'll turn you loose. Yeah, then you can console that snort nose fish of yours are not following in your fin swipes. Monsters, you won't get away with this. On the contrary, champ, we already have. That's right. Your kid should be home from school any minute now. Imagine his surprise, when he sees his dear old man is long gone. It'll be enough to knock him right out of training. Training? Training for what? Oh, you didn't know? This is a small reef. Gossip spreads fast. Where have you been? I know, watching Crafty Fish. [both laugh] You thugs underestimate my Charlie. He won't miss a beat. Once he realizes I'm missing, he'll move the seabed to find me. Not after he talks to our Glob, he won't. He'll shut up and sit down like a good little fish and wait for me to win your former title. What are you talking about? Who's Glob? You'll see and so will Charlie. By the way, you've got any competition tips for me? It might up the quality of your stay, if you know what I mean. Yeah, you're not too cold at this depth, are you? We could move you closer to the volcano. [both laugh] Pops, I'm home. Pops, you making dinner? Pops? Ah! Pops! Intruder, this is private property! Who are you? He-he-he, I'm Glob and I have a private message to deliver. So, this is the perfect setting. Message, what message? An urgent, top-secret, life-or-death message. - From who? - From your good buddy, Rip. Rip's not a buddy, he's a bully. And a good one at that. Now, listen up, 'cause I'll only say it once. You're gonna sit out the burping competition. If you so much as swim on stage, your Pop gets it. Gets what? Where's my dad? Gets it! And your dad's someplace safe for now. You won't get away with this. Neither will Rip. He-he-he, that's what Pops said till he got his mind right. If you hurt him, I promise, I'll... You'll what, pipsqueak? You don't have to do this! My dad's all I have. Cry me a whirlpool. Once the competition is over and Rip's the new champion, Pops will be returned safely. - What if Rip doesn't win? - I don't know. He didn't mention that. I guess he's pretty confident he'll win. He gave his word he'll let Pops go, once he wins the title? - Yeah. - Then tell him he won't see me on Sunday. That's a good little fish. Then tell him as soon as my dad's home safe, I'm coming for him. And he won't have any place to hide. Ha! Okay. I'll tell him. I'm sure his scales will be quaking. So long, sucker fish. They really did that? I knew Rip and his gang were no good, but I had no idea they were capable of this. That Glob guy said, Pops will be returned safe just as long as I don't compete for the burping title on Sunday, but I don't know if I can trust any of their words. A good rule of fin is never negotiate with terrorists. What other options does Charlie have, Jelly Fun? Oh, this whole thing makes me feel sick. Pops has been like a dad to me, too. I have no problem with not entering the contest, you know? If Rip was feeling that extreme about it, all he had to do was say something. I would have stayed out of it. I just want my dad back. We'll get him, Charlie. He'll come home safe. Don't worry. It's a good idea to skip Sunday's competition, Charlie, but I'm not so sure about waiting around for Rip to make good on his word. What else can I do? I'm just a little fish. I don't have a gang. I don't have some tough fish who can back me up. No... but I do. Wow! Older fish are so cool. Hey, who are you calling an older fish? Oh... I mean... not you. Just in general. Older fish have older friends, and they're all so different, right? Mm-hmm. Charlie, I want you to meet a couple of friends of mine. It's a bit of a swim to their place, but I think they can help you. If you're in trouble, they're good fish to know. And you're in trouble. Okay, Jelly Fun. If you think they can help me, then thanks. What are friends for? Besides telling you you're old. I want to come with you, Charlie. You may not have a big bad fish gang, but you have me. Thanks, Mucus. I'd love your company. It's settled then. I'll make a call and get you boys directions. Just remember to be careful out there. There'll be things in the deep-sea you've never encountered before. - Will do, Jelly Fun. - Good luck, Charlie. I look forward to meeting Pops soon. - What was that? - What was what? I heard a noise. Sounded like a moray eel. It wasn't a moray eel, Mucus. But this is their turf. How can you be so sure? Because if it was a moray eel, you'd never hear it coming. Yikes! Is that supposed to make me feel better? We're almost there. Keep your voice down. We don't want to attract any unwanted attention. Okay! Oh, wow! This must be the place. It is, Mucus. Say hello to Mutant Bay. I have pop-up books of this place. I never thought I'd actually visit. [male voice] Well, here you are. Oh! Who said that? Uh-huh, you first. Who are you, chum heads? I'm Charlie, and this is my friend, Mucus. Jelly Fun sent us. Oh, you're the little geeks she said she was sending. Um, I mean... yeah, I guess. Those weren't her words. I was just kind of putting two and two together. We heard you might be able to help my dad. Yeah, he got fishnapped by some real bad dudes. Fishnapped, huh? Yeah, I might have foiled a fishnapping or two in my day. Anything you could do would be much appreciated, Mr... um... Pete. Pancake Pete is my name and danger is my game. Wow! That's cool. Not really. I prefer gin and rummy, honestly, but danger sounds more awesome to newbies. - Yeah, it does. - Yep. So, tell me, who took your old man? Why'd they take him? Where are they keeping him? These jerks that go to my school took Pops to make sure that I don't enter the deep-sea burp contest this Sunday. And I'm not sure where they're holding him, or if he's even okay. We are worried sick. Worry is on you. That, I can't help you with. Right, okay. Now, let me get this straight. You're telling me kids fishnapped your dad? This sounds like an issue for the principal or the truancy officer. Well, they're not little kids. They've been flunking grades for years. Yeah, they're like full-grown fish in little kid classrooms. Some of our teachers are younger than they are. A couple of them can't even fit in their desk seats. Oh, so they're losers. Yeah, they're losers. That can be tricky in my experience. Losers usually got nothing to lose. You think you can help us, Pete? Call me Pancake. My friends call me Pancake. Wow! We're friends with Pancake Pete from Mutant Bay. It sounds like a pirate adventure on the high seas or something. Cool your fins, kid. No one likes an excitable fish. - Got it. - I think I can still do something for you guys, but I'd feel better about it if we could bring my partner, Big Eddie, in on this. He has more experience handling multiple losers. Yeah, do you think you can help us, Pete? That's what I like to hear. Let's go see him. Follow me. Have you rescued many other fishnapped fish, Pancake? I have done things. I have seen things. Wow, I feel so mercenary. - Don't. - Okay. It's no kind of life for a young fish. We do this because we have to. Because sometimes bad things happen to good fish and they need a break. - Got it. - Big Eddie's just up ahead. Be quiet and let me do the talking. He has flashbacks and can get rowdy if strangers surprise him. Once he knows you, he's cool. [both] Okay. Incoming! Pancake, you got two on your flank. Duck, and I'll cut them down like wild tuna. Yikes! Talk to him, Pancake. Yeah, now's a good time to explain. Easy, Eddie. Easy. These kids are friends of Jelly Fun. She sent them to us for help. Jelly Fun? she's old enough to be their mother. Any fish can swim in here dropping names. Where's the proof? My father's been fishnapped, Mr. Eddie, to prevent me from entering the annual deep-sea burp contest this Sunday. Jelly Fun gave us directions to find you and Pancake in hopes that you could help us get Pops home safe. That's all the proof we have. Hmm, dirty dealing in the burp contest, eh? Not the first time I've heard that. - Really? - Hmm. You'd be surprised the lengths to which some fish go for glory. - Will you help us? - I'll think about it. That's it? You'll think about it? Hey, you boys are the ones with your fins out. I don't see you bringing anything to the table. What can we do? I don't have much, just a half-full guppy bank at home, but you're welcome to it. I don't even have that. Just some snot from the other day, but it makes a great natural adhesive. It can bond broken coral, block pesky barnacles and shield fish from riptide currents. You're welcome to it. That's pretty thrifty usage actually. Keep that up. You could be one of us, someday. Wow... cool! Okay, tell you what. You kids keep the guppy bank and the snot. We'll help bring your dad home safe. - Really? For free? - Nothing's free, kid. Someday we'll call in the favor. When we do, remember you owe a debt. [both] Okay! Besides, I'm bored. I could use some action to spice things up around here. Agreed. Peace time is for plankton. Yee-haw! Yee-haw! - Okay, don't do that again. - Got it! So, I said to the little brat, "Do as you're told, or you won't ever see the old fish again." He-he. How'd that punk react? He hammed in hard, then agreed to everything, just like I knew he would. You hear that, Pops? Your boy doesn't have much of a backbone, - just like his old man. - You wish! [laughter] And get this, he says, "Once my papa's home safe, tell Rip, I'm coming for him." Can you believe that? A little fish like him. Ha-ha! - Oh-oh. - Repeat the last bit, Glob. - Which bit? - The bit about the little fish coming for me. I want to hear that again. So do I. I'll have a direct effect on his dad's accommodations. He... he said tell Rip I'm coming for him and he won't have any place to hide. Really? No place to hide, huh? [Rip sighs] Old fish, your stay is about to get a whole lot hotter. Hey, where is he? Where'd he go? Fan out, he can't be far. Find him. Find him, now! - There he is! - I see him. Is that as fast as you go, old man? You can swim, Pops, but you're the one with no place to hide. Here we come, we come, we come. Riches! I mean, Rags. Help me. They're chasing me. - Who? - Those young thugs. They've been holding me prisoner. What? Follow me. There they go. They didn't see us. My cave is perfect for laying low. What kind of mess have you gotten yourself into this time, Pops? It's more like what kind of mess has Charlie gotten himself into? They said they kidnapped me because of my boy. - Is Charlie okay? - I think so. Those hoodlums said they wanted to knock him out of this weekend's deep-sea burp contest. - Oh! - Do you know anything about that? Would you hate me if I said yes? No more than I've hated you in the past. Oh, well in that case, yes. What do you mean, yes? You mean to tell me you've been commiserating with my young son behind my back? He came to me for help, Pops. Help with what? Homework? You dropped out of school after I beat you for the burp championship, for Neptune's sake. No, not homework. He wanted to surprise you with a burp championship trophy on Father's Day. Oh! Oh, my! He asked me if I would train him behind your back. And I said I would. Well, I don't know what to say. Way to keep it a secret, by the way. - I've always been bad at that. - I know. Hopefully, I don't ruin Charlie's faith in ocean kind. He's a bright fish. He'll figure it out. Listen, Pops, here's the deal. Charlie has big dreams and with the proper guidance, he can achieve big things. That fish can do anything he puts his mind to. I can see it in his little eyes, but you guys aren't communicating. And he feels like he's on his own. So, he came to me. - To you? - To me. The fish who went from riches to rags? That's right. The fish most well known for losing the burp championship to you all those years ago. I'm going to talk to that fish about his role models. Pops, open your eyes. You're Charlie's role model. He feels like you shut him out, and he can't talk to you so, he found the next best thing. The loser who you still gripe about because he almost beat you when you were a kid. - Oh? - Yeah. And maybe you don't want to hear it, but he's right. You did shut him out. And you shut him out when he needed you most. You've gotten most everything you've ever wanted, man, the burp title, a legendary reputation, a nice home, a beautiful little boy, all the comforts, and you take it all for granted. Look at me. I'm all alone. I live in a cave, my color's fading, my eyesight's going, and I'm remembered as the fish who lost the very first deep-sea burp contest. And to put it that way, how depressing. Yeah, depressing. I'll tell you what's depressing. Your only son sought me out when he had life questions because his father couldn't even look him in the eye. You have everything a fish could want yet you keep finding new ways to throw it away because you can't enjoy the moment. That's depressing. Look around, Pops. This is my life. I'm lucky compared to you. - I'm sorry. - Don't apologize to me. Apologize to Charlie. Oh, better yet, go help him. He's growing up so fast, man, and he's figuring it out pretty quick, but every once in a while, he needs that nudge to stay on track. He needs his father, Pops. You're right about everything. I've been spinning my fins ever since I won that title. Stuck in the past watching the current pass me by. Now, my little boy is passing me by too. It's not too late, brother. Start right now. Go find him. I will. I will, Rags. How can I ever repay you? Well, how about another shot at that title, old man? This makes no sense. Where did that old codger go? How in the sea did he shake us? Maybe he didn't. Maybe a shark got him, or a giant squid. His eyesight has to be bad. He might have swum right into a moray eel's lair. Then wham, snap, crackle, Pops! - Anything? - We lost him, Rip. We don't know where that old fish went. You don't know? Let me get this straight. Two-fanged bruisers like yourselves failed, not only to catch, but to even catch up to an overweight geriatric pink fish. Um... yeah. I don't know why I bother sometimes. I really don't. I mean, come on, people! On the bright side, we think Pops might have been eaten by a bigger predator. That's right, he just vanished. He wasn't moving very fast. We don't know what else could have happened. We don't know what else could have happened, he says. Oh, I don't know, maybe he hid behind a coral and swam the other direction after you two dove past. Oh! Yeah, maybe. Or maybe he ducked into a cave and watched you swim away. Yeah, darn. Or maybe... wait a minute. That burping loser, Riches, lives around here. I hear he goes by Rags now, and squats in one of these caves. You fish follow me. Or better yet, go back to school! You do me no good. But school's out for the day, Rip. Well, maybe there's a detention you can get into or something. Um... I'd rather hang out with you. I'm thinking of dropping out anyway. School's just not going anywhere. [sighs] I have no words. Come on! Here we are. I can smell the Rags from here. How do you know it's him, Rip? 'Cause it smells like failure in there! Come on. We'll ambush them. Aha! Nice try, fish. Where is he? Where is who? And who are you? You can call us the three Mollusketeers. Hey, I like that. Let's dispense with the formalities. Wait. What? I don't know those words. I don't know who you boys are looking for, but I can assure you, you've come to the wrong place. - Oh, have we? - Yes. Now, this is my cave and I'm asking you to leave. We don't see no property deed. It's right there printed on that sea flower. Oh, would you look at that. Enough. You know why we are here, Riches, or should I say, Rags? Now, hand him over. For the last time, hand who over? Your arch-nemesis. The fish who defeated you for the first burping championship. Pops? I haven't seen that old coot in years. Well, then you must be senile because we know he came through here just minutes ago. You're way off your mile marker, man. But I'll tell you what. Have a look around, if you don't believe me. We will. Boys, turn this hole upside down and find me that fat fish! He-he-he, our pleasure, Rip. Whoa, buddy! Watch where you're... oh wow! Oh wow! It's you. - Who? - You, bro. The tops, the amazing Pops. You're like the first deep-sea burping champion, ever. I had your posters on my reef wall growing up. Yeah, yeah, listen. I need to get back to the sea stage right away, but I'm all turned around. Can you help me? Me? Help the most legendary fish in the sea? Yeah, buddy! Great. Am I far off? Which way is it? Well, let me see. Man! Man! Sea-stage is about 72 kilometers that way. Seventy-two kilometers? Ugh! Hey, that's not so bad. You can be there in about a half hour. No, you can be there in about half an hour. I can be there in maybe, five times that. Oh, slowing down, yeah? The years wait for no fish, young man. Drag, bro. Hey, if you catch a slipstream right over that reef there, you'll cut your travel time in half. - Yeah? - Yeah, I do it all the time. That's how I am getting to the competition on Sunday. Hey, are you going to compete, Pops? - No, but my boy is. - Charlie? Get out! I didn't even know he was a burper. Is he a chip off the old block or what? - We'll see. - I can't wait. And, listen, I'd love to see you back in action one more time, Pops. - Ah, get out of here. - No lie, bro. A lot of fish feel the same way. We grew up watching you burp. You're the reason we're all still competing in these crazy contests. You are ocean cool. Well, thanks for watching. What's your name? Me? I'm Lips, the next sea burping champion. No offense to Charlie. None taken. Good luck, Lips. It was an honor to meet you. Honor is all mine, boss. Thanks for the memories. - Slipstream that way? - There right. You'll swim straight into it. - You guys live here? - Right over there. - And I live over there. - Interesting. You like it? There are rooms for rent all over if you feel like sticking around. - No, I'm good. - There's lots of rooms for rent because nobody wants to be here, kid. Oh, well. What do I know? I'm not an abalone adventurer, or seafaring soldier of fortune, a marine mercenary, a sheriff of shellfish. You ought to write, you know that? You got a way with words. Really, you think so? Thanks. Say, you fish got a lot of cemetery space in this town? I'd have to ask around. Why? Because I'd die of boredom if I lived here. Boy! Ha-ha. Ha, funny. So funny I forgot to laugh. My dad's home is right this way, guys. Here we are. Ah... Pops is usually sitting there watching TV or napping. Exciting life. Okay, let's just get this out of the way. Charlie's dad is the Pops. You guys might have heard of him. The first ever deep-sea burping champion, an eternal role model for sea creatures everywhere. - Who? - Never mind. You probably don't follow this kind of stuff in Mutant Bay. You're too busy swashbuckling and saving lives and whatnot. - [both] Uh-huh. - Right. So, dad usually spent his time in this room. - Doing what? - I don't know. Sometimes watching his show, sometimes reading. Sometimes asleep. He never took you outside to swim? Never darted in and out of the windows here? I used to love doing that when I was little. - Me, too. - We do it at home sometimes. Yeah, not really. Like I said, we don't do too much. He's in his own world and I just do my own thing. You sure you want this guy back, kid? Of course I do. That's why I brought you here. I love my dad. All right. All right. I was just asking. Don't bite my head off, killer. It just sounded like it might be more fun without him, is all. Well, it won't be. My Pops is the greatest dad in the whole wide ocean. Sure, I'd like to see him more, and talk to him more, and play with him more, and do more stuff together. Hear more about his glory days and competition, but he's not into all those things. It's just not his style. [Pops] And I'm sorry for that, son. Pops! You're back! Oh, yeah, he looks familiar. I think I remember him. Lots of fish do. But there's only one fish who matters to me, and I sure let him down. I haven't been the ocean's greatest dad, that's for sure. Stop talking crazy, Pops. You're the best dad a fish could hope for. I appreciate that Charlie, I really do, but it's just not true. You deserve better, if not a dad who'd do all those fun things with you and more, then at least a dad who's present and paying attention. I've failed you on all fronts, my little man. And now, I'm hearing from third parties about your hopes and dreams, and what a fine young fish you've become. I'm just praying it's not too late to make up for lost time. I love you, son. I think I'm gonna cry. Me, too. Is there a tissue or something? What do you fish use around here? Seaweed? [sobs] We don't usually hang around crying our eyes out. I guess it's one of those days. Charlie, Rags told me about your plans for the deep-sea burp contest. Oh, so much for secrets. He didn't mean to betray your trust. I kind of dragged it out of him. - Are you mad? - Mad? Son, I couldn't be more prouder. Really? But I'm the whole reason you were fishnapped in the first place. Nonsense. Listen to me, Charlie, don't blame yourself for what bad sea monsters do to hurt others. You're a little fish with a dream and a noble plan to fulfill it. Those thugs were trying to take advantage of that for their own gains, but they failed. Yeah, because that's what losers do. - They fail. - That's right, Mucus. - And what you winners do? - They win! What do you say we enter that deep-sea burp contest, son? - Okay, Pops! - Looks like our work's done here, Eddie. That was easy. You know, these fish are pretty cool. Let's go watch the contest. What are we waiting for? Let's win this thing. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Fan, tentacle, spiny, gelatinous and, of course, sea monsters of all stripes to the ocean famous sea stage amphitheater. It's a very special day today, as you all know. Yes, it's Father's Day. So, hug the one you got. But it's also Judgment Day. On behalf of myself and all the judges of the trident triad, welcome one and all to the two hundred and forty-third, annual deep-sea burp contest. [cheers and applause] Ah... I'm nervous. [burps] What do you think's gonna happen? I know what's gonna happen. We got this thing in the net. Even if that old bum Pops got away, he's not fast enough to get back here in time. Charlie's probably balled up under his bed, crying. There's no way our fish, Rip, can lose. All right, burp fans, without further ado, let's meet this year's contestants. First up, watch your behind, here comes Tiptoes! [crowd cheering] [Tony] Next, that's not seaweed brushing against your scales. It's Tickles! [crowd cheering] [Tony] And now hide the algae, it's that hungry fish we all know and love, Scroodle! [crowd cheering] What do you think, Rags? Are you feeling nostalgic? For this circus? Nah. It feels like watching a DVD of some other fish's life. It's nice to see other fish getting excited though. Everyone needs to set goals. Mm-Hm. Some are just better at achieving them than others. What's that supposed to mean? Who's next, you ask? Why, it's ten fins of doom himself. Give it up for the best haircut down under. It's Broot! [crowd cheering] [Tony] Okay, okay. Quiet, everybody. You only need a good belly and a set of pipes to make the perfect burp, but a set of these don't hurt. It's Lips! [crowd cheering] [Tony] All right, all right, all right. Burp fans, what a roster so far, huh? Come on, let me hear it! - [crowd cheering] - [Tony] Crazy! You're all crazy! We're gonna need to bring in the crabpots to calm you down. Whoa! Okay, okay. Settle down. Settle down, now. It was just a joke. There are no crabpots, no crabpots. We're all safe here, all safe. Listen to these crackpots, they're losing their minds. That MCs gonna start a riot. Yeah, reminds me of the Mid-Atlantic coral reef riots of '09. How you doing with those flashbacks? Incoming! I'm kidding. Just having fun. I'm good, bro. All right, sea creatures, we're getting down to the nitty-gritty now. Is he a crustacean or is he a fish? I don't know myself. All I know is he's here to burp! It's Mucus! - [crowd cheering] - Yay! Come on Mucus. Whoo! [Tony] All right, this next fish needs no introduction, but I'll give him one anyway because he's one bad dude. We call him Rip! Yeah! Go Rip! Remember you're a freshwater fish, show these river rubes what's up! Yeah, let them know who's their burping boss! [chatter] Give him a chance. Come on, give him a chance. We're all just burping here. All are welcome. Every fish is free to burp. Boo! Boo! Okay, okay. Last, but certainly not least, we know this fish has greatness in his blood. We're about to find out about his burps. Put your fins together for our boy, Charlie! [crowd cheering] Way to put the pressure on. What the...? What does he think he's doing here? His Pops must have turned up, so he thinks he's safe. Rip will show him. Whoo-hoo! Ha-ha! Attaboy. Yay! Go, Charlie! [Tony] All right, sea creatures, and now for the moment of truth. Let's watch these brave contestants show us what they've got. In order of introduction, the stage is yours, burpers. [burps] [crowd cheering] [burps] [crowd cheering] [burps] [crowd cheering] [burps] [crowd cheering] What's up, brahs and brahettes? [burps] Yeah! [crowd cheering] [Tony] Attention! There is to be no speaking on stage. Only burping. Thank you! Whoops! Ha-ha-ha. My bad, sorry. Um... [hiccups] It's okay, Mucus. We love you. Thanks, Jelly Fun, for everything. I'll be back next year. [crowd cheering] [burps] Stick that in your gills, chumps. [Tony] The judges would like to ask the contestants to please exit the stage in an orderly and peaceful fashion. That's a championship burp right there. New champ, new champ! Winner, winner, winner! Okay, okay. This is for you, Dad. [burps] [continues burping] [crowd cheering] Wow! What a set of performances, huh? How about that? Put your fins together for our talented contestants! Yeah, we've never seen a year like this one. And our judges have informed me that yes, they have selected a winner, based on volume, bass, length of burp, audience reaction, calls to our hotline from viewers at home, and online sweets from the critter verse. Our winner, and new deep-sea burping cham... Wait! There's a... we have a... Oh, ladies and gentlemen and sea monsters of all stripes, we have a surprise last-minute entrant to this year's contest! Put those fins together and wave those tentacles like you just don't care, for the fish, the myth, the legend, the one and only Pops! [crowd cheering] You gotta be kidding me. We should have fed him to that volcano. Oh whoa! No way. Having second thoughts? Well, I'll be... the ocean must be boiling over. [crowd cheering] [burps deeply] [continues burping] [crowd cheering] You see Rip anywhere? Maybe he was dropping anchor on that old clownfish. Come on. Let's blow this seafood stand. If we leave now, we can beat the traffic. My goodness, Pops still has it. Rags? Now, how was that for a surprise? Come on now, where else can you get entertainment like this? Nowhere, that's where. You'd have to check outer space! But listen, creatures, my beautiful creatures, we're not done yet. That's right. This contest is not over until the fat whale sings. We have another surprise entrant! This guy just swam up and asked for a spot, and, well, as you can see, we never turn down a legendary burper. Beasts and barnacles, porpoises and plankton, it is my honor to introduce this next fish. Some of you know him as Rags, but some of us remember him as Riches. It doesn't matter what we call him as long as we call him to the stage. [crowd cheering] Yay! [burps and coughs] - Oh, no. - [Rags] Thank you. I had to give it a shot, Tony baby. That introduction, I'm not worthy. Pops, where's Pops? There you are, Pops. You were the better fish all those years ago. And you're the better fish today. It's an honor to compete against you, big guy. You'll always be Rich to me, pal. You push me. You rock, Rags. Thank you. [crowd cheering] What a class act! Give it up for Riches! Or Rags, whatever. Listen, creatures, for the first time in my tenure, I don't know what to say. The judges' scores are in and this is a first. We have a tie. Now, never before have we seen a tie in the history of the deep-sea burp contest. So we referred to the rulebook. And the official rule states on page thirty-one, column four that in the event of a tie score, the winner shall be decided by sudden elimination burp off. [crowd cheering] So, now without further ado, our Trident triad judges ask at this time that our two winners, please take the stage together. [Tony] Come back up, Charlie. And you, too, Pops. Pops, I know we're not supposed to talk up here, but I don't care. They can disqualify me if they want. Oh, Charlie. Nobody's gonna disqualify you, not with me floating here anyway, he-he. Yeah, you're probably right. Whatever happens, I just want to say again, I love you Pops. And I'm sorry I don't have a gift for you, but happy Father's Day, Dad. You're the best Father's Day gift I could ever ask for, Charlie. And I'm sorry if it seemed like I cared more about any title other than being your dad. Now, what do you say we show 'em how it's done? - Yeah! - [Tony] Whenever you're ready, Charlie. [Charlie] Here goes nothing. [burps] [continues burping] [crowd cheering] [Tony] Your turn, Pops! [little burp] Oh, my! [crowd cheering] Yay, Charlie! Ladies and gentlemen, the winner and new deep-sea burping champion, Charlie! Would you look at that? Who knew the kid had skills? Yeah, I could have used him in the past. Really? How so? Those burps could have scrambled the enemy's radio frequencies. Oh, well! [crowd cheering] It was nice hanging out with you today, champ. A lot nicer than binge watching Crafty Fish. I had lots of fun. Thanks again, Dad. What do you say we make it a point to do things together more often? I want to be more involved in your life, son. I'd like that. I'd like that a lot. - Then it's a deal. - Deal. - Hey, Pops. - Yes, Charlie? You're not upset that I'm the new burping champion, are you? Son, I'm delighted. I had so much fun competing in the burp contest again, if only for a day. - And it taught me a very valuable lesson. - What's that? It taught me that the past is in the past, and what matters most is right here in front of us, now. You're what matters most, Charlie. Besides, I'm defending a new title now. - You are? - Yep, the burp champion's dad. - Ha! Get out. - I'm serious. This is going to be so much fun. You have no idea. Now, off to bed, champ. You have media obligations in the morning. Okay, okay. I'm going. Nighty-night, buddy. I'm very proud of you. Oh, Pops, one more thing. - Yes? - You didn't throw the contest, did you? Don't be silly, Charlie. I gave it my all and I came up way short. Guess the old burper is not what it used to be.
