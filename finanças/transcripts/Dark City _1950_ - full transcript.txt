I'll be with you in a second. Another raid, huh? - Yeah. Stick around, Soldier. - Come on, let's get out of here. Just a moment. Tell Danny to take care of these. Get out of here now. Okay, mister. Here is your coffee. Don't bother. I've lost my appetite. Hey, Bobby. Hi, Danny. Want to do me a favor? - Sure. Take this over to Fran Garland at Sammy's Caf?. Okay. - Hey. Gee, thanks. Hello, Soldier. Hi Danny. The administration boys must be taking the election seriously. Barney said for you to call him. To take care of everything. I don't know why they always have to wreck the joint. The second time in three months. Barney must be sending the pay-off money to his grandmother. [ Telephone ] The place is closed. [ Telephone ] [ Telephones ] Barney said to give you this. Mr Vincent? Dan Haley. We just got raided again. I thought that last two thousand was the clincher. Mr Vincent, you stink. No, just Barney and Augie. The least you can do is get down there with the bail. Me? Just lucky. And a happy Easter to you. We're shut down for repairs. Just wanted to see if my boys had overlooked anything. Who are you? - Who are you? Captain Garvey. Vice squad. I'm Dan Haley. This is Soldier. Soldier was welterweight champion of the 19th Division. Haley. Do you run this? I got a piece in it. Penny alley stuff. Yeah. You hustle yourself a sucker, huh? I haven't seen one lately. Unless it is me. I paid for protection, or didn't you know? Look him over, Fielding. He's clean, Captain. Are you clean, Haley? Immaculate. How'd you get into this set up? You don't look like a hoodlum. Neither do you, Captain. Okay Haley. We don't have a thing on you yet. But I expect I'll be seeing you. Maybe he's right at that. There is no future around here. That's right, Danny. This joint is washed up. Remember Sweet, the old middleweight champ? I get a Christmas card from him every year. He was smart. Saved up his dough, got a place in Las Vegas. Everything is legal there. "Walk without my arm about you." "Baby." "I thought the day you left me behind." "I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind." "But now I find .." Hi Danny. I hear you got raided. That's tough. The cops have been there so often it's started to look like a precinct station. You ought to have seen what they did to this place when it was a Speakeasy. "Why do you have to turn off all the .." "Sunshine." "Oh baby, please come back." "Or you will break my heart for me." "Because I don't want to walk without you." "No, siree." I'll be back in a minute, Sol. I'm glad you're okay Danny. Come on over here. I waited until you came to open this. - Go ahead. Happy Easter. Oh, isn't it darling. Nobody has given me anything like this since I was in the 8th grade. I guess I'm not the type. I'm sorry about the raid, Danny. What are you going to do? The boys are out on bail, but we're closed down. If I had enough money, I'd move on. This is a dead end. I suppose that means we break up too? Where would you go? I'd go some place. Any place. Another dead end? You know. I can almost read your mind sometimes, Danny. Especially when you get that kind of funny look in your eye. What are you looking for, Danny? I'm not looking for anything. You just want to be left alone? That's right. Don't you ever get tired of being left alone? No. What kind of a girl was she? The girl who took you over the jumps. I knew there was one. I can tell. What do you want me to say? You could just say. "Fran, I love you". Just once, you could say it. I told you from the beginning I didn't want to get involved, Fran. Danny, you can't live without getting involved. I can try, can't I? Sol is getting impatient. That last number sounded okay when I came in. We're a great pair. I have no voice and you have no ear. Thanks, Danny. Take it from the beginning, Sol. Let's knock 'em dead. Don't knock, just tap a little and try and keep that tune in your head. If I had a head I wouldn't be doing a lot of the things I'm doing. "I don't want to walk without you." "Baby." That ought to hold now. It's a lot better with it chained. It will give us more time. - To do what, jump out the window? Hey, Barney. You know what the Doc said. If you start that again you'd split your gut wide open. Alright, Soldier. I won't touch it. Come on, Danny. Sit in for a couple of hands. No percentage. Playing cards with you two is like washing your feet with your socks on. It kills some time. You'd rather play with that dame down the street. He is a music lover. It's time, Soldier. - Never mind. I'll get it, Punchy. My name ain't Punchy. - Well it ought to be. You're about the punchiest .. - Shut up, Augie. Why did I have to get ulcers. The way we've been getting raided it's a wonder we haven't all got them. That's interesting, coming from the little man who wasn't there. Here's your medicine, boss. - Thanks, Augie. I have to drink it slow. The doctor says it puts a coat on my stomach. Sure, sure. It makes a good coat. Look what I did. Hey, there is a hole in it. Party fun. Hole in one. And you fell for it. Boy, are you a mess. Listen, you stupid .. - Get your hands off me. Cut it out, Augie. What's the matter? Can't you take a joke? Some joke. Now I'll have to send this to the cleaners. I'll be down at Sammy's. Sure. He's got a nice thing down there. "Darling, there has never been a love that is so right." "All I want to do is hold you ever so tight." "Oh, how I wish." "I could see you tonight." "That's a letter from a lady in love." "Darling, when I saw you." "My poor heart skipped a beat." "I'll thank my lucky stars again." "We happened to meet." "You will never know how I love you my sweet." "That's a letter from a lady in love." "I wonder what happened." "Why you went away." "I haven't seen you for an age." "And all the sweet nothings that you used to say." "Are written right here on this page." "Darling, if you ever leave me." "How I would cry." "I could never measure up to you." "But I'll try." "Did I say I love you?" "I can't say goodbye." "That's a letter from a lady in love." You should have tasted the Scotch they gave us in England. That was the real stuff. Boy, they gave us everything. Couldn't do too much for us then. How about another. Make me one too, George. How about letting me buy you one? This gentleman is from the air forces, Mr Haley. He defended England during the war. He did a good job. England is still there. Ah, there will always be an England. Hey, what is this, a rib? No. George was a gunner in England. I was in the 79th Bombardment at Steeple Morden. Yeah? I was with the 364th Fighter Group at Huntingdon. I knew some of the guys in the 364th. What's your name? Winant. Arthur Winant. First Lieutenant. - What squadron were you in? Well, I wasn't a pilot really. I was a Special Service officer. Same war. I guess maybe I was shooting my mouth off a little too much. "Why did I say I love you?" "I can't say goodbye." "That's a letter from a lady .." "In love." Say, Danny. Fran is really killing them tonight. Is she your girl? It's a free world. We go out. I was just thinking if she wasn't. I'd sure like to meet her. You could probably arrange it. Where you from? Los Angeles. - What do you do? About the same thing I did in the army. I'm an athletic director for a club in L.A. I came east to buy some athletic equipment. I got a brother flying in from Montreal tomorrow night. He's going to help me. There you are. Keep the change. Thank you, sir. Hello. Miss Garland, this is Mr Winant of Los Angeles. Late of the Army Special Services. How do you do. - How do you do. I enjoyed your singing very much, Miss Garland. Really terrific. Well thank you very much. - You've quite an admirer in Mr Winant. You certainly have. I was wondering, Miss Garland. Pardon me for interrupting you two but I have to run along. Got a little game of cards. A game? But I thought .. - A private game. Why don't you come up after the show tonight? Anything you say, Danny. See you around. Keep 'em flying. Oh, Mr Haley. Is the place far from here? - Just around the corner. I was thinking .. If the game isn't too steep I wouldn't mind losing a couple of bucks. You'd be in pretty rough company. I've been in rough company before. I usually hold my own. Glad to hear it. Okay. You're over 21. Alright. See you later, Miss Garland. Let me take that, Lieutenant. I'll hang it up for you. Thanks. What you say we start with fifty dollars each? Fine with me. Cut for deal. Oh. No offence, fellahs. But what do you say one of you sits out the game and deals? That way I only have to watch one dealer instead of three. No objection. - Okay. I think I'll pick my friend here. You're a pretty cagey player. Well after all, I don't know you fellows. You're strangers. And this isn't exactly the first game I ever played in. My brother taught me quite a bit about poker. Your brother must be quite a guy. Yeah, he is. Let's make it interesting. Oh, before I forget it. Do you mind if we set a 2 o'clock deadline? I've got a big day tomorrow. Yep .. Sidney is quite a guy. I used to go on fishing trips with him. Then he'd let me carry his fish home and say they were mine. Some brother. Yep. I remember once I ran into a guy with my bike. I was about 8 years old then. And the guy slapped me and I told my brother about it. The next day I pointed the guy out to him. Now at the time Sidney was only seventeen and the guy was full-grown. But let me tell you Sidney almost killed him. They held him in custody until they were sure the guy was going to live. Some brother. Hello, Miss Garland. I guess you're good luck for me, huh? - Always glad to be of service. He's won almost every hand in the last three hours. Yes. It's getting late, isn't it. For sure. It's past 2 o'clock. That's our deadline. Give us a chance to get even. You're 120 bucks into me. He's over 60 into me. Last hand. Alright. Let's make it twenty. Two. I'll take two. I'll take two cards. Alright. Twenty more. I'll see you. And raise you twenty. No. He's too lucky for me. Call you. Beat two pairs. I thought you were bluffing. You can't do it? Okay. Check me out. Alright. That makes 325. Here is your coat, Lieutenant. Thanks. Oh. Buy yourself a cigar. I hope you won't be offended but .. You know it's considered bad luck not to take care of the dealer. Thank you very much. Hey. How about giving us a chance to get even? Well, it's a little late right now but .. What about tomorrow night? Okay. - About seven? Fine. Miss Garland. Would you have dinner with me tomorrow night before the game? I'll have to think about it. Alright. First he takes all our dough. Now he wants to take Danny's girl. I guess that's what they mean by "special service". Goodbye. See you at the club then. Don't forget about the game tomorrow night. Oh no, I'll be here. I've got to pick up my brother at the airport. So I have to quit at 11:30, win or lose. Win or lose. It's all the same to us. As long as we're having a good time. - Sure, that's all that matters. Having a good time. Well, goodnight all. Goodnight. Soldier, my cream. In the bottle. Suppose he don't come back. We're down all the dough we got in the world. He'll come back. Won't he, Danny? Yeah. He'll come back. Come on. I'll take you home. I hope he doesn't show up. - He will. That kind of sucker always shows up. What's worth such an elaborate set up? A $5,000 cashier's check. The Poor guy. He took our money. He was willing to win from us. This set up is dog-eat-dog. I had to learn it the hard way. Let him get it in one easy lesson. - Does that go for puppies too? Record or Journal? Both. Keep it. - Thanks. Don't you want to know what's going on in the world? What's going on in the world stinks. With your share of the five thousand you'll leave, won't you? You're going to walk out. I don't know. I think you know, Danny. I don't like to be needled this way, Fran. There's many things I don't like either. I don't like working in that place. I don't like guys looking at me the way they do. I don't like any part of this. But I have to take it because I have to live. What's your excuse, Danny? I'm tired of talking and getting no answers. I'm tired of making believe that everything is just fine between us. I don't like it this way. I don't want it this way. There's no other way, Fran. I thought that was understood. Sure it was. You understood it. I did not. Everything for you. Nothing for me. I'm in the same boat with that dope, Arthur. Make it ten. I'll call. Three kings. That's tough. I got a full house. Gee. Gosh, I haven't won a hand in over an hour. You've just hit a bad streak. Maybe he needs Fran around to bring him luck. She's set me up with dinner tonight. Never trust a woman, Arthur. Ah, that's the way luck goes. Bad for a while. All of a sudden it will get good. Twenty. I'm out. Three. I'll take two. Check to you. Twenty. I'll call. Two pairs. Not good enough. Well, that cleans me. That's too bad. It's still so early. If you want to go on with the game Arthur, I could let you have a hundred. No thanks. If I lost, how would I pay you back? Why worry about lending money to a guy with a check for $5,000 in his pocket. Hey, now wait a minute. Not that check. It's not mine. I wouldn't use it no matter what happened. Thanks. What time is it anyway? Ten o'clock. We still got a couple of hours to kill. Yeah, and I got a feeling I can still take you guys. Danny, I'll take that hundred. Look. This really isn't my money. It belongs to the club. What's the matter, Augie? Didn't you play it on the level? Isn't the house percentage good enough for you? What's your beef? We got his dough, didn't we? Danny. Was the game on the level? A guy like that cheats himself just by sitting down. Sorry I got mad the other night. It doesn't matter. Everybody gets mad sometimes. Now that you've got your money .. - I haven't got it yet. Finally, he has to clear the check through a friend of his. When you do you'll be leaving. Not sure I feel like going anywhere now. Oh Danny. Don't close in on me anymore, Fran. That's all. I won't. Here, son. Let me have one. Maybe we can catch a movie. Danny .. Danny. - What's the trouble? It says. - It says what? "Arthur Winant." "Identified as a resident of Los Angeles." "Hanged himself last night in his room at the Wellington Hotel." "His body was discovered by the dead man's brother." The yellow jerk knocking himself off. You shouldn't have brought him here. - You shouldn't have crimped the cards. You shouldn't have done it, cheating the Lieutenant. What's up with you, Rumdum? - Let him alone, Augie. I don't like him round here. That dumb look on his puss all the time. Guys like you ought to be put away. There's nothing we can do about the check now. If they track us down they'll say we made him sign it. I don't like it. I don't care what you don't like. I want my dough. I talked to our lawyer. He said not to cash it. This could be a tough rap. - Give me that check. Barney is right. That check has got dynamite in it now. Maybe a little later we'll see what we can do about it. This whole thing gives me the creeps. All day long I've had the feeling that I was being followed. [ Telephone ] Well what are you waiting for punchy? Answer it. [ Telephone ] Hello? Yeah. 1752 Meredith Street. Room 207. Who was that? I don't know. He didn't give no name. But you told him the address. - Why did you do that? Because I was hoping it was the cops. Because I wish somebody would come down and kill the whole murdering lot of you. Relax, jerk. The Lieutenant was a good guy. You didn't have no right to cheat him. - Soldier, look. You're worse than the rest of them. Danny. They don't know no better. You're worse than all of them. [ Buzzer ] Who is it? - Fran. I've been calling all evening. Did you just get in? No. I've been here. Why didn't you answer the phone? There was nobody I wanted to talk to. You want me to go? No. I know you feel bad, Danny. I feel fine. I'm glad you're here. Are you? Sure. I'm glad. How long can you stay? An hour. I go on again in an hour. Hey. That hurt. You're a million miles away, Danny. I don't know where I am. You're here. With me. Yeah. Okay, Fran. You're okay. [ Telephone ] Let it ring. Maybe it's important? What's important to me? I don't know what's important to you. Don't you ever need anybody, Danny? What for? Just to need. [ Telephone ] Stop ringing! [ Telephone ] Hello? What do you want, Barney? Danny. I couldn't sleep. I feel awful. My stomach is churning like a washing-machine. "Take your pills, Barney." Danny. You wouldn't come over? Maybe it's just nerves but .. Like I told you today, I felt I was being followed. It was the same thing tonight, all the way home. I'm tired. Call Augie. "I tried. He's not home." Danny. I've got the shakes. [ Banging noises ] I thought I heard someone on the fire escape. Go and look. You've got a gun. "Not since the raid. You've got it." Look Barney, you're imagining things. Now take your pills and go to sleep. "And don't call me anymore. I'll see you tomorrow." If you'd just come over for a .. Danny? [ Banging noise ] Did you lock that door? Hello, Barney. You're late getting home, aren't you? Since when has that interested you? - I just felt lonesome. There wasn't anybody outside when you came in was there? Say, are you alright? What's the matter with you? You haven't got a drink have you? Any kind of a drink. Your ulcers must have taken a turn for the better. And don't forget the loan. You wouldn't let me come in? - Goodnight, Barney. Sit down, boys. That's all, Sergeant. Well Haley, I didn't think we'd meet again so soon. Neither did I. They transferred me to homicide for this case because .. They knew that you and I were old friends. Well. Boys, how did he look to you? The same old Barney. Yeah, that's how I always look at corpses. With my eyes closed. Do you know any reason why Barney would want to hang himself? No. I mean, was be being threatened by anyone? Did he own any money? He was sick. He was always worrying about it. The autopsy showed that .. He had one small bleeding ulcer. Not enough for him to hang himself. You see the point is, he didn't. The facts are he died from strangulation. Not from hanging. When he was found, there was a small welt on his neck from this. Right here. And there was another welt lower down, right smack across his Adam's apple. Somebody snapped this rope around his neck from behind .. Choked the life out of him and then strung him up. Pretty. Well, Augie. Your alibi holds up. You were at a crap game last night. Are we under arrest? No. No. Guys like you seldom get arrested. You get killed first. You still don't figure in this racket. Your alibi looks pretty good, too. This .. This girl. Fran Garland swears that she was with you at the time of the murder. Who do you think did it? In the business Barney was in you make a lot of enemies. It could have been any crank disappointed over a two-buck bet. That how you feel about it? Sure. What about this ex-pug works over at your joint? Soldier? He couldn't have done it. That guy couldn't last one round with Barney's ulcer. Anyway, Barney has been feeding him for years. He loved Barney. Augie. You've been up three times. And Haley, we don't have think on you yet, but .. We get your fingerprints and your right name. You've got my right name. It's funny how things happen. 36 hours ago, there is a young fellow from Los Angeles blew into town and .. You must have read about it. He was taken with some gamblers. He signed over a $5,000 cashier's check. Money that wasn't his. Then he goes back to his hotel. He .. Gets up on a chair with a rope around his neck. Ties the rope around a chandelier and kicks the chair out from under him. 24 hours later a gambler is found hanging. Does that ring a bell? It's a big city. It's a dirty mess. Mrs Winant is flying in from Los Angeles. We expect her any minute. Because he left a kid too. Tough. It's kind of a peculiar case. A brother found the body and called the police. He kept screaming that the guys who fleeced Arthur were guilty of murder. He sounded like a nut. The police went to the hotel and .. They found the body alright, but no brother. There was an open envelope addressed to Sidney Winant. But there was no note and no Sidney Winant. He just disappeared. Tough. No connection between Barney and Arthur Winant? Never heard of him. [ Buzzer ] Yes? Mrs Winant to see you, Captain. Bring her in. That's all, boys. Don't worry. I'll get in touch with you. Follow me please. Alright you. Let's go. We've got names. Yeah, and how many? Looks like the brother got Barney. I sure feel like a drink. - So do I. Soft. Are you kidding? - Come on. The brother Sidney must be the guy that called Soldier and got the address. He must have waited outside and seen Barney. Barney said he thought he was being followed. If he saw all of us then he knows who to look for. I'd like to find that guy and talk to him. Maybe he'll find you and he won't talk. He doesn't sound like a guy that likes to talk. You think he's still around? He did it, Barney was just the starter. Sure, he's still around. He came down from Canada didn't he. Maybe he went back. - Maybe. Spilling it all over here. Just like Barney. Hey, look. I bet she's going to meet that brother. Come on. It makes sense, don't it? What we going to do? Sit here like a pair of pigeons? If we follow her we'll really be pigeons. It will all add up for Garvey. Don't you know he's got us spotted? Since when did you start running things? Look Augie, I don't like you any more than you like me. As a matter of fact, I hate your guts. But as long as someone is trying to kill us both we're forced in to partnership. Unless you've got a better idea, we'll have to stick together. Is that clear? - Okay. "That old black magic has me in its spell." "That old black magic that you weave so well." "Those icy fingers up and down my spine." "The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine." "The same old tingle that I feel inside." "And then that elevator starts its ride." "And down and down I go." "Round and round I go." "Like a leaf that's caught in the tide." "I should stay away but what can I do?" "I hear your name and I'm aflame." "A flame with such a burning desire." "That only your kiss can put out the fire." "For you are the lover I have waited for." "The mate that fate had me created for." "And every time your lips meet mine." "Darling, down and down I go." "Round and round I go." "In a spin. Loving the spin I'm in." "Under that old black magic." I thought you had left. I got worried. Just wanted a breath of air. Let's take a walk by the river and cool off. I'd love that, Danny. I wonder where it's going. Across the Styx. - What? In Greek mythology. The Styx was the river over which the souls of the dead were carried. Also, even more appropriately, called the "river of the underworld". I don't know what you're talking about. But it doesn't matter. I love you, Danny. Why don't you tell Garvey about Arthur Winant? Because the heat is on Garvey. He's got to pin his hangings on someone. It won't be me. I know what I'm doing, Fran. Please let's not fight. You need me almost as much as I need you, Danny. I know I could make you happy. Fran, look. You're a nice kid but it wouldn't work out. That's the way it is. Is there somebody else? No. But there was. And you wanted to marry her. I did marry her. The next thing you knew she'd run off with some other guy. So now you won't even let yourself be human. A girl walked out on you and you couldn't take it. But You'd take it out on me. Now you think that every girl is a tramp that .. Come on, I'll take you back to Sammy's. Sorry, there is no answer in Miss Miles' room. May I take a message? Thank you. - May I have my key please? What number please? 224. Dan Haley. I'm sorry Mr Haley. This is my first night here. It's not here. I remember. I gave the key to 224 to a gentleman just a few minutes ago. You gave out my key? Well I was taking a call at the time and this man just asked for the room number. I'm terribly sorry. Shall I call the police? - No. I have an idea who it is. A friend of mine. I'll get a duplicate key. - No. There is a vacant room next to mine isn't there? 225? That's right. Let me have the key to that. And to the connecting door. I want to surprise my friend. We can forget your mistake. Thanks. Alright, Mr Haley. [ Buzzer ] Augie. I just dropped by to .. See what was doing. I couldn't find Soldier. The guy at the desk said you were out. I thought I'd wait for you. We're .. we're in this together, Danny. Sat around in the lobby. I don't know. For hours, I guess. I saw a lot of funny-looking characters. Made me kind of jumpy. There's a new guy at the desk. Figured if I got the key I'd wait for you in the room. With a gun? - I didn't figure you'd ring. Look what happened to Barney. - You'll be a great help. I must hang a bell on you so I know where you are. You don't have to get tough. You know what, Augie? What? You're yellow. I never saw you pick on anybody that wasn't old or sick. This is no time for us to get in an argument. Yeah, I know. Get out, Augie. And keep that gun in your pocket. Okay. Soldier doesn't worry you, huh? Soldier? These guys that go nuts from punches in the head. You never know with them. You never know with anybody, Augie. I'll relieve your mind, Haley. That .. that was just Lieutenant Jackson of homicide squad. Taking Mrs Winant's train. We try to show courtesy to out-of-towners. Come to think of it. This is the scene of the crime, isn't it. It's one of them anyway. You know you ought to be more careful. You know there is an old saying about .. Murderers returning to the scene of the crime. Yours must be a fascinating business, Captain. I want to see you at headquarters in the morning at 9 o'clock. 9 o'clock sharp. I asked you to come in Haley because .. We got a very interesting letter from the Adjutant General's office about you. "Daniel H Haley." So that is your right name. "Captain. US Army Air Corps." You were court martialled in England in 1943 for killing a man. I was acquitted. But even after the acquittal, you could not keep out of trouble. You were .. "Frequently unmanageable and drunk on duty." You killed an officer from your own squadron. Why? You hold the letter. It is all there. In a fight over your wife. It should also say he was my best friend. Is that why you started hitting the bottle? You know, a lot your best friends die, Haley. It's what interests me about you. Where is your wife now? She was English. I suppose she is still in England. I wish she were in .. - You are divorced? You know, you never went home again after your return to the States. Why was that? Do you have a bad transcript Captain or do you just enjoy the sound of my voice? Your father was a West Point man. He wouldn't forgive the scandal. I can see how you got to be a detective. "Cornell 1937-41." Sure, with those references you had no trouble getting work in a bookie joint. What did you do after college? Sold insurance for a while. Then the war came along and my father got his wish. I signed up to be a hero. Yes. According to the record you did alright in that field. And that's the only reason you got off so light in the court martial. That was a long time ago, Captain. Not so long ago. And Barney's death was quite recent. How do you think you're going to get it? With your protection, I feel perfectly safe. This is not for laughs. I get paid to protect people. I don't have to like them. Just protect them. Mrs Winant gave us some very interesting information about Sidney Winant. There was an unfortunate relationship with his younger brother. Sidney completely dominated him. He protected the kid and yet .. He demanded he be best in everything he did. Kind of a .. kind of a father complex. He's going to kill you unless we can stop him. I don't plan to get killed, Captain. What do you plan to do? Stay out of trouble. Keep out of his way. Did you ever see a sheep in a slaughter house? He's scared. Panicked. The smell of death frightens him. He knows there's danger but he can't tell what it is. So he huddles with the rest of the flock. Moving when they move. He's a good little sheep, just keeping out of trouble, away from the light. And suddenly a gate opens and it's a way out. He's running down a long passage .. Because to the sheep it looks like the way to freedom but .. There is a man with a sledge hammer waiting at the end. You may get an opportunity to learn how that sheep feels because .. There is still no trace of Sidney Winant. We .. we had a letter from him. That was saying that justice would be done if the police didn't interfere. I've got sixteen men out now trying to track him down .. Because he's a homicidal case with one up and two to go. And you and Augie are Sidney Winant's unfinished business. And unless we get him first he's going to get you as surely as he got Barney. I hope you find him. You'd better hope. Where is the check, Danny? Look Captain, my present crime is dealing cards in a bookie joint. Is that what I'm being questioned about? I'm so sick to see you guys come in here one after the other, I want to throw up. Every one a carbon copy of the one before. Everyone going to shake the world until it hollers .. And not caring who gets hurt along the way. And everyone ending up just like Barney. Those are the kids out of the slums, out of the gutter. They got two strikes against them before they steal their first apple. But you've got no excuse for being here. You killed a man. Why, I don't know. It's got nothing to do with this case. But unless you get hold of yourself. You're going to end up like all the rest of them. One day you're going to lose that smile, Danny. One day you're going to hit bottom and break every bone in your body. And when it happens you'll be like all the rest of them. You won't have the guts to do anything but lie there. Now get out of here. And get out of town, fast. "I wish I didn't love you so." "My love for you." "Should have faded long ago." "I wish I didn't need your kiss." No Soldier. No Sidney Winant. Nothing. Bourbon. Double. Fine. We got this guy on our tail and we don't even know what he looks like. You know any man in this room might be Sidney Winant. He knows us. He can see us. Wherever we are, whatever we do. We can't see him. It's like being followed by an invisible man. We can give him the check back. Get him to lay off. Can't talk with a man you can't find. It's why Garvey wants us out of town. He doesn't want more killings on his hands. He's got a good point. I think I got a better one. What? This fellow Winant comes from Los Angeles. Maybe somebody in his home town knows where his brother is. We can find him before he finds us. And knock him off first? - If we have to. We'll go on separate planes. I'll take the ten o'clock flight. And you come on a later one. We'll meet at the Union Station in Los Angeles at noon Friday. And then what? Try and see Mrs Winant. - The widow? Yes. You try to get a lead on Sidney. You've looked up people before haven't you? Yeah. And I found them. What about the check? I don't like us splitting up when you still got it. If anything goes wrong I won't be hard to find. No. I guess you wouldn't. "I wish I didn't need your kiss." "Why must your kiss .." "Torture me as long as long as this?" "I might be smiling by now." "With some new tender friend." "Smiling by now." "With my heart on the mend." You leaving, Danny? Any message for Fran? - No. No message. Tell her that's the kindest thing I ever did for her. "You're still there." "I wish I didn't love you so." You got the time, mister? You're late. - I got lost. Come on. Get in. What did you find out? - Nothing. Nobody seems to know him. Automobile club. YMCA. A lot of places. Nothing in any of them. Everybody that knows Arthur clams up when you mention the brother. You know what I think? All the time, Augie. Okay, okay. But we're not getting any place here. Now look, the check is good. It's got the jerk's signature on it hasn't it? There is just the two of us now, so we split 50-50. I don't want to look for the guy no more. We'll try it for a week. We ought to be able to find a picture of him somewhere. A high school yearbook .. or some place. We can't afford not to try. Remember what happened to Barney. If we don't find him in a week. We'll cash the check and take our chances. Hello. - Hi here. Is this the Winant house? Yes, but there is nobody home. I'm watching the house. I guess it must be pretty safe then. You want to see mummy? - That's right. My mummy is shopping. What's your name? - Mr Branton. I'm Billy. This looks like a pretty strong swing you've got here, fellah. It is. My daddy made it. - He did? There is mummy. Mummy. - Billy. Hello mummy. - Let me help you. How do you do, Mrs Winant. I'm Richard Branton from the Empire Insurance Company. I'm their investigator for this territory. I tried calling you several times on the phone but there was no answer. Well. Since you have the packages, won't you come in. I'm hungry, mummy. When aren't you? He is quite a boy. Well, I think so. The package. Thank you. Now, mister ..? - Branton. Mr Branton. I never heard my husband mention anything about .. Having a policy with the Empire Insurance Company. Well the policy was taken out on him by Sidney Winant. According to the report he is your husband's brother. He is the beneficiary but my company has been unable to locate him. We felt perhaps you could help us. You are the next beneficiary. I haven't heard from him in some time. You must have some idea where he is. Your husband went east to meet him. I had no idea that Arthur was planning .. I'm afraid I can't help you, Mr Branton. But he must have some friends, Mrs Winant. Could you give me the names of .. - No Mr Branton, I can't. I am sorry. I've been through quite a bit recently. The police back east asked me so many questions. They are looking for Sidney too. They .. think he killed one of the men who robbed Arthur. Robbed him? Yes. Robbed him. Tricked him into playing cards. Cheated him and robbed him of money that wasn't his. Robbed him of his self-respect. And made him take his life. He didn't have to play. When he lost he didn't have to kill himself. If you didn't know Arthur you wouldn't say that. How can I be sure that .. That you are who you say you are, Mr Branton? How can I be sure of that? Please, I wish you to go now. I know how you feel, Mrs Winant. If you should change your mind. I'll be at the Wiltshire Plaza for a few days. Mr Branton. Would my .. Would my son and I have to be involved? You wouldn't be involved at all, Mrs Winant. It's simply a matter of establishing identification. Thank you. What is it you need? Any kind of a clue at all. Letters or photographs. My company is especially interested in getting .. A picture of Sidney Winant as proof of identity. Well, he did have a lot of things stowed at the Careys where we used to live. There might be some photographs there. - Could we go there now? Well, it is a little late. I have to prepare dinner. Could you be back here at noon tomorrow? Alright. Noon tomorrow then. Thank you very much. - Thank you. Who is it? - Danny. Where were you? I waited in the store until 10 o'clock. I thought something had happened to you. It did. I don't feel good. Give me that. What you do that for? - Shut up! If I catch you with a bottle again I'll break it over your head. Did you find out anything? - No, I didn't. I think I talked to one guy too many. An old friend of Sidney's. He kind of gave me the fisheye. I think he knows where Sidney is, and he'll tell them. I hope he does. By tomorrow we'll be ready for him. Not me. I'm getting out of here. The first big city I come to, I will cash that check. Don't make me laugh. Alright, give it to me. You listen to me you stupid jerk. That's the last time you ever pull a gun on me. I said a week and I meant it. You'll do just what I tell you to do. [ Door knocks ] Please, you will have to stop that noise in there. You are waking everybody up. Alright, Augie, you don't have to do anything. Just sit there. You'll scare yourself to death. If I want you I'll get in touch with you. If you want to do any more fighting mister, go someplace else. We got a respectable trade here. "Away for a few days. Check me Monday. Mrs Carey." Oh no. I am terribly sorry about this. I hope this won't upset your plans too much. Well, it does leave me with a lot of time on my hands. Yes. I suppose I could do some sightseeing. Oh yes. There are lots of things to see. Griffith Park. The Planetarium. Ocean Park. Olvera Street is charming. I'm not much of a sightseer. Unless I have company. Well. I have to pick up Billy at school. Children love me almost as much as dogs do. You know, Mr Branton. Since the moment I saw you. I've had the feeling that I've seen you before. Maybe you have. I've been lots of places. What about it, Mrs Winant? Right. Since I got you here under false pretences I .. I suppose I'm really responsible for you. Fine. Get in. Oh boy, ice-cream. Ice-cream. What about you? - No, no. Sure, come in. Yes. A nice big smile, please. Hold it. Okay darling, come on. My picture. Thanks, Mr Branton. I had a neat time. That's alright, Billy. Maybe we'll do it again sometime. I should thank you too for being so patient and so sweet to Billy. I enjoyed it. Well I'll keep on to the Careys. Perhaps when I get the pictures you would like to come out for dinner? I would like it a lot. You wouldn't consider making it tonight would you? But I .. I haven't been going out. Just some place quiet and maybe we could go for a drive. I am a stranger. Alright. Give me an hour, huh? "The star Altair is just rising above the celestial horizon." "There to the east." "That point of light we see in the evening sky." "Travelling 186,000 miles per second." "Left Altair sixteen years ago." "And the Griffith Planetarium concludes this part of tonight's demonstration." "The stars of spring." "Now, while the music plays." "We will watch the stars pursue their course through one more night." You know. You forget how beautiful things can be. That is beautiful. Like the sky in Italy or the Riviera. It's like a lot of things. It's different too. You have been in a lot of places for an insurance salesman. You're a pretty unusual person yourself for a Los Angeles housewife. Well, I .. I don't think things ever turn out quite the way we plan them. You were living here in Los Angeles when you married him? No. Arthur was headed overseas when I met him in New York. I was working for the International Red Cross. We were married after only a few weeks. And Billy was three years old when Arthur came back. It was really unfair to expect he would be the way I remembered him. Arthur was a very understanding person. Most war romances needed a lot of understanding. Why, it .. It wasn't just the uniform. People really are different during the war. I guess the stars are the only things that never change. That's only because we can't reach them. Sometimes I think we can. I'll check this last stack. There won't be any pictures of Sidney in there, Mrs Winant. Because you don't have any pictures of him. No, it's true. I destroyed them. You did what? I destroyed them. But why? Not because of the insurance. For Billy's sake. I've been afraid. I've been afraid that .. That Sidney might do something to Billy. That he might take Billy away from me. If I had the money I would .. I would take Billy away from here. I would .. I would go back home to Europe. Where we would be safe. I hope he's dead! Why are you afraid of Sidney? Because he's psychopathic. He is what? He was confined in an institution for years. Why haven't you told me this? I didn't trust you then. Anyhow, I didn't think you would keep on insisting. I destroyed all the pictures I had of him. I didn't want my son to be brought up .. Knowing that his uncle was insane. I didn't want anyone to know. And I am afraid. Sidney was always jealous of me. There is no way of knowing what he'll do. Yet I can't feel sorry for him taking revenge on those men. "Hiya, Billy." "I just got in this morning and saw this recording place." "Billy." "I'm homesick already." "I'd sure like to be back home with you and your mummy right now." "Billy. Will you do me a favor." "Will you kiss her for me." "And would .." "Oh, they're signalling me. My time is up." "My time is up." "My time is up. My time is up." "My time is up." You play it too often, Billy. It's getting worn out. Say goodnight to Mr Branton. Now it is past your bedtime. Goodnight, Mr Branton. Goodnight, Billy. I'll be back in a minute. It was one of those "send your greetings home" records. I got it the next morning. Are you still in love with him? No. I don't think I ever was. When Arthur came back from the war we were strangers. Do you have to sell this place? I still have two mortgages on it. It was hard enough to manage when Arthur was alive. Well, don't be in too much of a hurry. I mean, you've had only bad breaks. Maybe you're ready for a good one. What do you mean? - The policy. I'm leaving for Las Vegas on another matter. Then I'm going back to Chicago. If we haven't been able to find Sidney Winant by then the money goes to you. I expect ten thousand would help. It would take care of everything. Well. I'll call you before I leave. Look, Victoria. I have to tell you something. My name isn't Branton. It's .. It's Dan Haley. I'm one of the gamblers who played cards with your husband. I remember now. I saw you in Captain Garvey's office. Sidney was determined to kill everyone who had anything to do with it. He's got one of us already. I came here to find him before he found me. Get out, please. I thought the game was legitimate. Legitimate? Arthur playing opposite three professional gamblers. The way you used me to save your own skin was bad enough. But to come here and make friends with Billy. After murdering his father. Mister Branton. You didn't forget about the movies tomorrow? Billy, you had better go back to bed. Mr Branton is leaving. At least the club will get its money back. I'm sorry. Augie. Augie? Okay, take him down. Yeah, that's him alright. The way they fought the other night I thought he was going to kill him then. Hello, Danny. Well. This is a pleasant surprise. - It's still the same case. Come on, we're going to take a little walk. Get your coast. I didn't do it, Garvey. That's what I've been trying to tell them. I think you would like to but I don't think you did. You came out here to find Sidney Winant but he found you first, huh? At least he found Augie first. Well Danny, all the things we talked about are kinda coming true aren't they. You're getting closer to the bottom all the time. I won't be alone. That's where you're wrong, Danny. You are alone. And when a guy like you dies, he dies alone. Come in. This is Captain McDonald. Chief of Homicide. We're letting you go, Haley. But don't come back here because you are an undesirable. And we don't want any more killings. Look. You're only postponing the inevitable. Sidney will follow me wherever I go. My only chance is to stay here and bring him out in the open. Well, you'll either have to get out of town or else .. stay in jail. Well, where are you sending me? - Where do you want to go? Las Vegas. Las Vegas? I've got some unfinished business there. Taxi. Soldier. - Danny. You look great. Sure. I feel like a preliminary boy. What are you doing here? Remember, you used to talk about Swede all the time? Yeah. I came here right after it happened. I've been working for Swede ever since. I read about Barney. Was it the Lieutenant's brother did it? Yeah. He's a crazy sort. Augie is dead too. I'm not sorry to hear it. What about .. - Me? I'm okay but I'm broke. I got some dough, Danny. - Thanks a lot, Soldier. But I'd rather have a job. I'll introduce you to Swede. He's a swell guy. Good to see you, Danny. How is Fran? I wouldn't know. Oh, I thought you two would get together. Can you put in a good word for me with the Swede? Lots of them, Danny. Lots of them. You're always looking for something, Danny. What do you want, more customers? Aren't you satisfied? I've played here every night this week and never won yet. Hit me. You see. Broke. Well, you did pretty well this week. I hope you're planning on sticking around for a while. Do you suppose you can let me have an advance? Say .. A couple of hundred? Sure. I don't suppose you'd care what I do with my nights off. No. What are you going to do? Take it over to one of the big places and blow it in? I hope I don't blow it in. There's something bothering you, Danny. I don't know what it is but I can tell. I just owe someone some money. Something I did once. My heart feels too. Come on over here. See that? He looks like a pretty good boy. He was pretty good. Once. I killed him 18 years ago. 18 years ago this month, in Memphis. A fight? - Yeah. I keep wanting to take that picture down but I never do. He was a Mick with a mother and half a dozen brothers and sisters. He supported all of them. I went to the funeral with 1,800 bucks in an envelope. Every penny I had in the world. Well. After the funeral, I went to his mother and tried to get her to take the money. But she wouldn't. I tried to push it into her hands. She spat in my face. Why? You didn't owe her anything. You didn't commit any crime. The kid died. You didn't want it to happen. It was part of the business you were in. I don't get it. I don't get it either Danny but that doesn't change anything. Does it. You're late tonight. - Sorry. I'll take it now. Take a break. He's cute. A small one please. Hit me please. Hello Danny. Hello, Fran. It's all in the cards, I guess. Did Soldier tell you I was here? - Uhuh. I suppose he thought I was getting lonesome. It was a funny thing, Danny. A guy like you getting lonesome. I couldn't quite figure that. But I hoped you were. Going to stay a while? I got a job. Soldier arranged it with Swede. Soldier is the most practical cupid I've ever met. You're not mad, Danny? - No. When do you start? - Tomorrow. Still tied up in knots aren't you. You haven't forgotten Arthur. Sorry. I keep crowding you all the time, don't I. I must stop it. Did you ever forgive me for running out on you? I never owned you, Danny. I said, did you ever forgive me? You're not asking if I forgive you. You want to know how much a woman will forgive. You are asking if Arthur's wife will forgive you. I thought you were going to stop crowding me. Alright, Danny. Hello. Who are you? My mummy is not home. Don't you remember your uncle Sidney? Give that back or I'll tell Mr Branton. Where is he? He went to Las Vegas. Hello, Danny. Good luck tonight. I'll see you later. You're not going to catch my act? - You're not nervous, are you? This is the biggest audience I've ever had. If only you were out there. - You'll be alright without me. I'm going over to the casino. I think I can make a killing. Good luck. Good luck to you. Danny. "Dan Haley. Telephone for you." "Mr Dan Haley. Telephone for you." Next hand. I'll play 8, please. Come on, dice. Seven! All ready? Four tray. Seven. "Your love is all that matters." "It's the world and all to me." "My heart would be in tatters." "Without you, what would I be?" "So darling, love me with a kind of love." "That understands." "Although it isn't much." "My life is in your hands." "But what would I do." "Or what would I do." "If I didn't have you." "If I didn't have you." Thank you, Soldier. Well, Soldier fixed good all the way around. That was okay. Thanks. Buy her a drink. - Sure, Swede. What will you have, Fran? - I guess this calls for a celebration. Scotch and water. Scotch and water, Tom. Soldier, you know where I'll find Danny? There's a long-distance call for him. He's off tonight. - I'll take it. Maybe it's important. Mr Haley's call please. Hello? Mr Haley isn't here. Could I take a message? This is a friend of his. Frances Garland. Who is this? Mrs Winant? Mrs Arthur Winant? Please. It's urgent that you get a message to him right away. I've put calls in all over Las Vegas. Tell him that Sidney Winant was here. That he knows that Danny is in Las Vegas. He left here almost two hours ago so .. Please hurry. Who bets the field? That's two thousand. Let it ride. Come on dice. Seven four tray. Nine. Pay the field. Put it on nine please. Come on, dice. Come on! Come on, dice. Seven. Be there! Eight. Come on dice. Any point but not number nine. Come on nine. Nine! Danny. Thanks. How much have I got? Fifty-seven hundred dollars. Will you cover it? Give the gentleman the dice. Seven. I'd like to cash these in. Very well, sir. Eleven thousand four hundred dollars. Thank you. I must cash these in. - Cash them tomorrow. He may be here any minute. - I've got a hunch he's here now. Yes, sir. How do you want it? - Big as you got. Give me an envelope. Danny, I'm going with you. - No. - I'm going with you. Look Fran, this is important. If I'm not here in the morning. I want you to go to the bank and get a cashier's check for this. Made out to "Mrs Arthur Winant". Mail it to her. Danny. I talked to her on the telephone. From the way she talked, I .. I think she could forget about it. She was so scared. I think she'd forgive you. Thanks. Soldier, where is your car? - Outside. I'd like to borrow it. Sure, Danny. Any time. Thanks. Look after her. Is there a plane out of here tonight? Where do you want to go? I don't care. Just away. [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] Yes? "Just a minute, Mr Haley. I have a long-distance call for you." "Hello? Hello? Danny?" Victoria. "He knows you're in Las Vegas." "Please be careful. You know he's insane." I get your message. He's following me now. "Danny!" "Hello." "Operator, get me the police! Operator!" "Danny, what is the matter?" That's all, Winant! "Danny, are you alright?" "Danny, answer me will you." "Please, Danny." Go pick him up, Jim. You're lucky we got here in time to get you a doctor instead of an undertaker. How are you, alright? - Yeah, fine. Well Danny, we took your advice and used you as a decoy. You certainly didn't leave us much margin of safety. Noting to worry about, Captain. Whoever heard of a dead decoy? Hello Victoria. "Flight 27 loading at Gate 2 for Los Angeles." "Flight 27 loading at Gate 2 for Los Angeles." Fran. Danny. You're on the same flight? Are you going back to her? - No. Then what are you doing here? I told you, Danny. I think she could forget the past. Yeah, but I couldn't. You're my kind of girl, Fran. You don't want to be alone anymore? No. I don't want to be alone anymore. 0h, Danny. Miss Garland, will you board the plane please. Thanks, but we've got .. We've got other plans. |* t-g *|
