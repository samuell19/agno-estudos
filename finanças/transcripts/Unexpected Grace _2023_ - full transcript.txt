(♪♪♪) (chuckling) This place seems so much smaller than I remember as a kid. A kid, huh? You know what I mean. Oh, they still have the... The wishing well. Can I have a quarter for a wish? A quarter? Did you know that, when you were little, a wish only cost a penny? It's called inflation, Mom. Oh, really? Okay. Well, these will have to do. - Thank you. - Two nickels. I'll be right back. (fountain bubbling) So, Toni, are you gonna tell me what you wished for? Do I have to? I'm your mother! You have to tell me everything. - Fine! - (laughs) Uh, with one nickel, I wished for things to get better between you and Dad. Um... and the other, I wished to find a best friend. But you have a lot of friends. Yeah, but... it would be nice to find a best friend who isn't trying so hard to impress everyone all the time. Someone I can hang out with and just... be. I mean, we're called "human beings," right? I can be your friend. Thanks, Mom, but someone my own age would be nice. - Okay. - Yeah. Um, one time, at science camp, we did an experiment where we let go of a weather balloon. It got about... 30 yards, then it hit a spruce tree and popped. (laughs) Hmm. That gives me an idea. - Okay. - Come on. It's gonna be fun. You see what he's doing there? Blowing up the balloon? No. It's called "inflation". (giggle-snorts) Oh! You made me snort! I always do. Mm. What are you doing? You want to find a friend? Let the fates decide. "But... if the while... I think on thee, dear friend, all losses are restored... and sorrows end." Of course you go with Shakespeare. "Sonnets" number 30. Your turn. Okay. ♪ We can last forever ♪ ♪ If we stick together ♪ ♪ In the here and now... ♪ So? What did you write? It's a secret between me and my future B.F.F... Oh, okay! - Are you ready? - Yeah.

Hi. (man) Hey, Grace. Grace! Hey. Did you not plan on eating today? No, thanks. I'll just grab something at the snack shop. Are you sure? I put a cupcake in here. I had a feeling. You sure you don't want me to drive you? Nope. I'm good. Thanks. All right. Love you! Bye! Teenagers are tough. You can say that again. Well, don't worry, it gets easier... but not for a while. You have a teenager? No, but I was one once, and I have two sisters. We did not make it easy on my parents, that's for sure. How did they manage three girls? Well, my dad mostly deferred to my mom. Hmm. It's just my daughter and me. I saw the moving trucks a couple of months ago. I've been meaning to come by and introduce myself. - Audrey Wollinsky. - Hi, Audrey. Jack McCabe. Nice to meet you. That's my daughter, Grace. Must be hard being a single father. Well, feel free to let me know if you need anything. I just live down the street. Green house. Yeah, will do. I have to head off to work. I'll see you around, Audrey. - Nice to meet you, Jack. - Take care. (♪♪♪) (brakes lurch) Go ahead. You... No, you. All right. Thank you. (brakes lurching) (laughs) Thank you. (♪♪♪) (school bell rings) (teacher) Okay, everyone, settle down. I'm going to start handing out your papers. Hey, Liv. Any big plans for spring break? We have a basketball tournament up in Portland. Nice. I love basketball. I used to play... at my old school. You guys can do better. That's on you, McCabe. Okay, I don't know about your old school, but it is very competitive here, so if you want to be my lab partner, you're gonna need to step up your game, big-time. (teacher) Let's look at the effects of... (♪♪♪) Hi, Maya. Hi. I cannot wait for this day to be over. Hey, what did you get on your project with Liv? C-minus. Ouch. I bet she wasn't happy about that. She was brutal. Don't worry about Liv. She's harmless. I thought you liked science, though. What happened? Yeah. I don't know. It's not the same as my old school. This place is different than most places I've lived. It's harder to meet people here, and you're the only person who talks to me, and that's only because you're my peer tutor. That's not true. I mean, I get extra credit for doing it, but I think you're pretty cool. Thanks. You too. Have you eaten lunch yet? No, I didn't. I'm starving. Here. Have half of this. Thanks! (munching) So good. I haven't had a PB-and-J since I was a kid. That's my dad. It's one of the only four foods he knows how to make. It's kind of cute that he still makes your lunches for you, though. My dad just hands me money. He still treats me like a kid, though. It's so annoying. He didn't even ask if I was okay moving here. He just got a job, and that was it. Parents are like that. All they care about is their jobs and money. Okay. I better go. Hey, I was wondering if you wanted to hang out during the break. I'd love to, but I'm going to Whistler with my parents. Sounds fun. Yeah. Thanks again for the sandwich. I'll see you later. You're welcome. Bye. "I grant, I never saw a goddess go. My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground. I think, my love as rare as any she belied with false compare." (hushed whispering) Emily? What do you think Shakespeare was trying to say to the dark lady? I don't know. Maybe that she was, like, pretty and stuff? Talk more about the "and stuff". Is Shakespeare being... sarcastic? Flirtatious? Perhaps... ironic? Yeah, probably one of those. (students laughing) (firmly) I am aware that many of you are taking this course to fulfill a requirement, but you may want to check my office hours before next week's in-class essay, if you need more help. Class dismissed. Have students always been this disengaged? I'm not sure they're more disengaged, but they're certainly more interested in the social aspects of college over academics. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure I was the same way as an undergrad. Oh, you and me both. Being young isn't easy. Those hormones and wide-open future... It's exhilarating and scary, all at the same time. Are you okay? Yeah. You just reminded me of something Toni once said about everyone trying to impress each other. Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... No! It's fine, Chris. Really. How are you doing with everything? "Grief makes one hour ten." Shakespeare. He always had an answer for everything. Well, if you need to talk, I won't even charge you. (laughs) Well, the benefits of having a friend that's a psych professor. No, I'm fine. But I might take you up on that someday. Absolutely. I've been struggling all day to find jobs to keep my guys busy here. They're ready to break ground. (boss) I know that, Jack, but I need you to hold down the fort. Can you do that? Yes, sir. You know how these things are, Jack... bureaucrats. Yes, sir. Yeah, I'll wait on your go-ahead. Enjoy the weekend. You have a good weekend, too. All right, guys... pack it up for today. Red tape, I guess. (sighs) See ya later, Jack. (dials) (phone rings) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) Hey. What's up? Did you see my calls? Yeah. So what's the point of you having your own phone if you don't even answer my calls? I was worried about you. I didn't feel like talking. You didn't feel like... talking? Great... You found your mom's necklace. It looks nice on you. - Thanks. - Yeah. Talk to me, Gracie. What's going on? I, uh, I have free time this weekend. Let's do something. (phone chimes) Okay. What's so important that you just had to check your phone in the middle of our conversation? A singer I follow just posted a picture. I see you kids staring down at your phones all day long. 'Kay, like... like, look up and appreciate the world. Wow! The sky, the clouds, and... What's in that tree? Grace, come on. I'm being serious. No, seriously. There's something in that tree. I don't know. Looks like a kite or something. It kind of looks like a cupcake. Everything looks like a cupcake to you. Should I climb up and get it? No. I'll... I'll grab a ladder later. I'll knock it down. Hey, quick game of "HORSE" before dinner? You know you want to. You're on. Are you boycotting your food or something? Did you know the term "boycott" came from a man in the 1800s? Charles Cunningham Boycott. I did not know that. I thought it came from a bunch of boys in sleepaway camp protesting their beds. "Boycott". The joke is kind of like this meal... Not your best effort, but... not your worst. Ooh, burn. I think brats are my... (German accent) wurst meal, ja? I get it. Bratwurst. Now, see... (laughs) You're the only 13-year-old I can imagine getting that joke. You trained me well. Yeah, I did. Which brings me to the next topic. How can such a smarty-pants still be having a hard time in her classes? I got another email from Mr. Brown, saying your science grade isn't improving, even with the tutoring. He's worried that you're "underachieving". How does he know I'm underachieving? I've barely been here two months. Maybe it's my normal achieving. They've seen the transcripts from your old school. They know you make straight "A" s. Well, people change. Do they? Or maybe they make poor decisions. Like moving away three states in the middle of the school year? Grace, I... (sighs) Look, nowhere's perfect. Look, I'm sorry. I know this hasn't been easy for you. If you want to make new friends, just... go be friendly. It's not that easy, Dad. I can't just walk up to somebody and ask them to play. I know. I know. I... (sighs) I know you're not a kid anymore. I wasn't try... (doorbell chimes) (sighs) Look. Try harder in school, okay? You have such a brilliant mind. Hey. Audrey, right? You remembered! Yeah. Hi, Jack. You baked us a pie? Just a... a little "welcome to the neighborhood". That's so sweet of you. Uh, come on in. We are just finishing up dinner. Um, I can put some coffee on. - Sure. - Yeah? Hey, Gracie! This is our neighbor, Audrey. She brought us this... this... fresh pie. Would you like a slice? No, thanks. I'm stuffed. I'm gonna go take out the trash. Hmm. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) "Looking for a friend? You're not the only one. I've never had a penpal, but you look like a good one to me. Write to me at the address below. Toni." (♪♪♪) (gasps sharply) Toni. (sighs) (exhales deeply) (exhales deeply) (♪♪♪) (exhales deeply) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) You're up early for a Saturday. Yeah. Just going to a friend's. Oh. I thought you said you don't have any friends here. Well, more like a potential friend. Mm? Mm-hmm. Bringing your last cupcakes? She must have a lot of potential. Hey, I thought Audrey seemed nice, right? Yeah, I guess. The pie seemed like a sweet gesture. Very much like your cupcake. Hey, you know what? Hold on. I can drop you off at your friend's house, - if you want. - Sure. (♪♪♪) ♪ Sinking Deeper and deeper ♪ ♪ I won't stop ♪ ♪ To come up for air ♪ ♪ You've made me... ♪ (Jack) All right. I think this is it. All right. Have fun. Okay. Bye, Dad. Be careful. I will. And what do you do when the phone rings? Answer it. Bye. ♪ This is it ♪ ♪ It's the moment and the magic ♪ ♪ We can hold and never forget ♪ ♪ This is it ♪ ♪ This is it ♪ - (yelps) - Oh! Sorry. Hi. Are you... - You go ahead. - No, you. Please. Here.

I found what was left of your balloon in a big tree near my yard. My name is..." (overlapping with Grace) "Grace McCabe..." (Grace) "...and I'm 13 and a freshman at Ash Park High School. My dad and I just moved to town, so, yes... I'm also looking for a friend. I would love to be your pen pal. I assume by your balloon that you must love cupcakes. I love them, too. But who doesn't, right? So if you'd like a balloon-finding, cupcake-loving buddy, you can write me back... Maybe email is easier. Grace at GracieCakes dot-com. P.S... Bonus points if you happen to be good at science, 'cause I'm not doing so hot in that class. P.P.S... Cool quote. Was that Shakespeare or something?" (chuckles softly) (sighs) (takes a shaky breath) Hey. That was fast. How was your potential friend? Oh, yeah. She wasn't at home. Oh... I think, um, whatever was up in this tree must have blown down. Want to do something fun today? Want to go explore town? Audrey was telling me about this great hiking trail not too far from here. Maybe the three of us can go together. I did enough walking today. Would you mind if I went with Audrey? Really? She's our neighbor. Yeah. What's wrong with that? You do whatever you want to do, Jack. It's "Dad," and I'll be home in time for the Nuggets game. Maybe... finish unpacking your stuff? (♪♪♪) (phone alert chimes) "Dear Grace McCabe, thank you so much for writing to let us know you found Antonia's balloon." (Noelle) "We did that experiment to find a new friend, and I guess it was a success. I hope you're enjoying your new home. It's a wonderful town to grow up in. Your new friend, Noelle Webb. P.S. There's a great bookstore cafe near your school. It's a good place to do homework, check out comic books, and meet other kids." (Jack) Oh, good! You got the game on. What's the score? Nuggets up four. Jokic already has 12. Ahh! Here. Oh, man. You're looking chipper. I made a new friend. Noelle. Remember that girl's house I went to, and she wasn't home? Yeah? Well, her sister emailed me. She told me about this cool bookstore in town. Hey. Good for you. See that? Things are coming together for you. Now you just have to concentrate on your grades. (commentator) Goes for the shot, and... Oh! From downtown! Nice! For three and one! (doorbell chimes) Oh, be right back. (game continues indistinctly) You're just in time. Hope you like pepperoni. - Yeah, my favorite. - Let me take your jacket. Sure. What are we watching? Hockey? You guys can watch. I'm gonna finish unpacking my room. Hey, wait... seriously? Why don't you just finish your pizza? I'm good. (game continues) "Dear Noelle and Antonia..." "Hey, girlfriends." (blows air) "I was happy to... " No. "I was pleased to hear from you." (sighs) A little help here? (♪♪♪) "Dear Noelle... I'm so happy to hear from you. Sorry for leaving a letter on your front porch. I hope that didn't seem stalker-ish. I was too excited to wait for snail-mail. Where's Toni? Are you two into Shakespeare? Seems like he's a pretty big deal in this town. Thanks for the tip about the bookstore. I'll def check it out. Do you ever feel like, sometimes, people can leave us at the absolute worst time, but then the right person can also show up at exactly the right time? That's how I felt when I saw that balloon. It's like you literally fell from the sky. Anyway. Hope you're having a great day, Grace." (exhales softly) (doorbell chimes) (sighs) Noelle Webb? Yes. You've been served. (sighs) (♪♪♪) (phone alert trills) Five-minute warning to complete your essays. (sighs) Just a reminder... I will be giving extra credit to anyone who attends "Sonnets Under the Stars" tonight. Hot chocolate? Cool necklace. Oh. Thanks. I haven't seen you here before. First time. We moved to Ashland a couple of months ago. Nice. Well, welcome. You found the coolest place in town. Congrats. Good to know. (phone chimes) (Noelle) "Dear Grace, Shakespeare once said, 'What's past is prologue, ' which, to me, means the present is exactly how it's meant to be, because of the past. I'm glad you found that balloon. Have a great rest of the day. Your friend, Noelle." (♪♪♪) (humming cheerfully) What are you doing home so early? Um... apparently, there's some issue with our contract. I am loving this new mood of yours. Did I hear you singing when I came in? My new friend, Noelle... I feel like she really gets me. That's great. Maybe you should invite her over for dinner sometime. Dad, we just met. I don't want her to think I'm desperate. Right. Got it. Um, hey, Audrey wants to go to this Shakespeare thing tonight... Shakespeare? I want to go. You do? Okay, great. I'll, um... I'll let her know. Cool. (♪♪♪) (audience applauds) Thanks for this, Audrey. This is nice. I always found something romantic about Shakespeare's words, even if I don't always understand them. How about you, Grace? Have you studied Shakespeare? No, but I want to. (Noelle exhales) Ahem. "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate." "Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, and summer's lease hath all too short a date, but thy eternal summer shall not fade, nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st..." "Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade, when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st. So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, so long lives this... and this gives life to thee." (♪♪♪) (applause rises) (♪♪♪) "Noelle Webb". (email chimes) Wait... "Noelle, I went..." (overlaps with Grace) "I went to Sonnets under the Stars. There was a Noelle Webb reading Shakespeare." (Grace) "Is that you? I thought you were a kid. Or maybe it's somebody else. Confused. Let me know." (♪♪♪) (Chris) Well, I imagine getting divorce papers, no matter how inevitable, is still a shock. It's just really sad. 16 years of marriage... over. And it's been... what, two years now? Mm-hmm. But you were having issues before? You see, my experience is that these things either bring couples closer together or wedge them apart. Well, we definitely got the wedge. (chuckles dryly) Right. There's something else that I'd really love to get your thoughts on. Yeah, of course. (sighs hesitantly) (cafe music plays, light and bouncy) Hey, you're here again. Oh, I was bored. We got to be the only two people still in town. I'm Owen, by the way. Grace. Do you like comics, Grace? Oh, yeah. I don't know why I said that. I actually don't own any. Well, now you know the guy to ask if you ever want to get started collecting. Okay. Thanks. That would be great. No problem. I'll just be over there, if you need anything. Thanks. Did I go too far? She thought I was her age. Well, you never actually said that you were a kid, but you also didn't say that you weren't one. And you didn't tell her about Toni either. I mean, this poor girl thinks that she's got two new best friends. But one of them's an adult, and the other one's... well, you know. (Noelle sighs) What should I do? You have to end it. I know you have good intentions, but I don't think this is healthy for either of you. Send her a message. And be direct. Tch. (exhales deeply) (keys clacking) (Noelle) " Grace... I am so sorry for the misunderstanding. I didn't mean to mislead you. I was also surprised and excited that you found the balloon. I didn't want to leave you unanswered. And yes, I am the same Noelle from the other night. For a lot of reasons, I'm afraid it's probably best if we stop communicating. You are a very special young lady, and I wish you the best. I am confident that, when you settle in here, you will make many great friends your own age. Best, Noelle." Hey, sweetness. Don't you have work today? No. So I have a little time. Um, there's a standing flea market in town. I was telling Audrey about it. She wants to go. Do you want to come with us? No, thanks. Thought it'd be fun. You used to love flea markets. I used to love going to them because Mom loved the flea market. Yeah. Yes, she did. She would always find such great little treasures, like that necklace. Are you trying to get Audrey to like everything Mom liked, or something? I didn't think about it like that. I just thought it'd be something fun to do. Audrey's a friend. She definitely wants to be more than friends. And if you don't want more, you probably shouldn't lead her on. You think I'm leading her on? I don't know, Dad. She seems perfectly nice, but I can tell you're not interested in her. We have to live next to her. The longer you take to break up with her, the more awkward it will be. Well, we don't have to break up because we're not together. Okay. Have fun at the flea market with your not-girlfriend. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey. (sighs) Ah. I never thought I'd be the guy getting dating advice from his daughter. Just so you know, this road goes both ways, so if... If you ever need advice with... you know, with boys, of course, but with anything, I just... I want you to know that I am here for you. I'm good, Dad. Great talk. I'm going for a walk. (doorbell chimes) Can I help you? It's me. Grace. Grace. Uh, what are you doing here? I wanted to meet Toni. I thought maybe she still needed a friend, like the balloon said. Is she home? Um, no. No, she's not. Well, come on in. Get warm. You must be freezing. Uh... well, can I get you some tea? Sure. I thought you were, like, my age this whole time. Toni's sister or something. (awkward chuckle) Is that her? Yeah. So you're her mom? Yes. Look, I'm sorry that you thought I was a kid. As I said, I didn't mean to mislead you. The truth is, I kind of enjoyed our little messages. It was nice to talk to someone again. My mom died when I was seven. Breast cancer. My dad takes me to fundraisers for breast cancer... the walks and the special events... helping others helps me feel close to her. He sounds like a good dad. He tries his best. But... sometimes, a girl just needs her mom. (kettle whistling) Um... okay, well, would you like chamomile or green tea? Chamomile would be great. Okay. What made you change your mind about the flea market? You know, Grace reminded me that it was sort of her mom's favorite thing, and I just... I don't think it'd be right. I understand. Good. Hey, look, Audrey, I wanted to talk to you. I feel like we... Jack? You don't need to say it. (laughs) It's pretty obvious. It is? Okay. Well, thank you. I... It has nothing to do with you. I think you're a great person. I just... I, uh, I'm in a different place, right now. Jack? It's okay. Thanks. (door shuts) (calls out) Hey, Gracie? (phone chimes) All right. Here you go. Some nice hot tea. Careful. It's hot. Everything okay? Mm. Just my dad, and he's coming to pick me up. He worries about me too much. Mm. That's what parents do. They worry. Toni looks like you. Oh. (awkward chuckle) May I use the restroom? Um, sure. Yeah. It's just up the stairs. (sighs heavily) (♪♪♪) Grace? (gasps) I'm so sorry. I was just curious. That's okay. (doorbell chimes) That must be your dad. Wait. You're Grace's dad? Yeah. Um... I'm Noelle Webb. (chuckles) So... you're Noelle? (Jack) Okay, so let me get this straight. So you two have been... you've been e-mailing back and forth, but you thought that she was a kid, but that was a big misunderstanding? I'm sorry for the confusion. Okay. Why do I feel like there's so much more to this story? Noelle is Toni's mom. Oh... okay. Got it. So where... where is Toni? - She's not here. - She isn't? What... where is... where is she, then? Why are you here? Why did you come? I didn't know she wasn't here until I got here. Okay, you left without telling me where you were going. You didn't call, you didn't text. And so I'm... I was... I was, like, I was worried. I just didn't think it was a big deal. You didn't...? Come on! We always talked... like, Noelle, that would be a big deal if Toni did that, right? Right. I'm not just trying to be the bad guy all the time here. Right? I mean... it's called being a parent. Isn't that right, Noelle? Look, there's something that you should know. Okay. I get it, Dad. I'm sorry. (deep breath) Thank you. I'm sorry. What... um, what did you want to say? You know what? Let's just talk about it another time. All right. Um... hey, if you and your family want to come over this week for dinner, that way, we can kind of get to know each other the proper way? And I'd love to meet your husband and your daughter as well. Well, we're not together anymore. Offer still stands... If you want to exchange numbers, we can make plans. Sure. Yeah. I'll be in touch. Great. Um... oh! I wanted to say, the, uh... the Shakespeare thingie you did the other day, that was... it was beautiful. And, uh, yeah, I thought you were the best one. You really were! Thank you. (Jack) Yeah. (soft knocking) You know I love you, right? I can't always relate to the struggles of a teenage girl, but... I'm trying. I know, Dad. You should know, I talked to Audrey. You broke up with her? (chuckles) She, um... she sort of broke up with herself. It was... (laughs) It was weird. Yeah. But, um, we never made it to the flea market, so... maybe you and I could go together sometime? Sure. I'd love to. Okay. Me too. All right. Enjoy that. You gotta get ready for bed, okay? 'Night, sweetness. Goodnight, Dad. "Noelle... Sorry for tonight. I hope Toni and I can still be friends when she gets back." (♪♪♪) (school bell rings) How was your tournament? We got second. That's too bad. Out of, like, 30 schools. Mr. Brown? I'd like to request a new lab partner, please? In the real world, you can't always choose who you work with, so... neither can you. (Liv snickers) Yeah. I'll be over in one sec. How's it going, Jerry? Jack... I just want to give you a heads-up. There's a good chance I'm gonna lose our funding. The new governor's tightening the purse strings. What does that mean for me and my guys? No funding, no building. We have a two-year contract. I moved here for this job. I know. That's why I'm giving you the heads-up. We should know more by the end of the month, but I'm just sorry to be the bearer of bad news. (exhales tensely) (text alert chimes) (♪♪♪) You can order food if you want. No, no, no. I'm... I'm just reading the menu. "The Hamlet omelet," "the Macbeth and cheese... " your town really likes, really likes Shakespeare. (chuckles) Yeah. My favorite one is the "Julius Caesar" salad. (Jack laughs) Hey, um, you and I both work for the same institution. I'm foreman for the construction project on campus. At the science center? Is that still happening? (scoffs) I don't... I'm still waiting on final approval. I... I wish I had a nickel for every time they told me "one more day." So your daughter sent me an email, telling me that she still wanted to be friends with Toni when she got back. It's probably my fault, so... I've been worried about her and...(sighs) So I'm... I'm a single dad, and she is my entire world, um, even if she often wants nothing to do with me, um, so, yes, it's fine with me, if Grace is friends with Toni when she gets back. Jack... the thing is, Toni isn't coming back. What do you mean? Toni died... a little under two years ago. And in that final Spring with her, we tied a note to a balloon, a cupcake balloon, that ended up in your tree. And in that note... Toni was asking for a best friend. Grace found that balloon and saw the note? Yeah. And she left the balloon and letter on my porch that day that we almost ran into each other again? (quietly) Oh... yes. Grace wanted a real friend so badly, just like my Antonia did. And so you... you wrote back, pretending to be Toni? No. No, I wrote back as "Noelle," but your daughter assumed that I was Toni's sister. Oh... I hope that you understand that, when I read that letter... it was like my daughter reaching out to me. Grace is the same age that Toni was when she passed. And I just... I couldn't bring myself to tell her that Toni wasn't with us anymore. I didn't know how she would take it. (takes a shaky breath) I think you did the right thing. (Noelle sighs with relief) So, ever since Grace's mom died, she doesn't handle loss or change very well. I... So I... I think it would be best if we told her together, as soon as possible? I agree. That gives me an idea. Will you and Grace meet me later today? Sure. Cool. Hey. Do you think it's strange that you and I bumped into each other twice in the same week? I don't think anything is strange anymore. (♪♪♪) What are we doing here? Well, I thought this would be the best place to share my story. Two years ago, I came here with my daughter, Antonia, to start off the first day of Spring. Toni made two wishes... and she dropped them in this wishing wall. And with one nickel, she made the wish that her father and I would get along better. Now, the funny thing about wishes is, sometimes they do come true... Just not in the way that you think they will. Her father and I are... better now. We found a peace and respect apart that we... we didn't have when we were together. What was Toni's other wish? To find a new best friend. (plop) After making the wish, Toni got a cupcake balloon and she attached a note to it and she released it into the sky. It was beautiful. But there's more to the story. Shortly after that day, Antonia got sick... and she passed away. I... I don't understand. It all happened so quickly. She's not with us anymore, sweetie. I... (stammers softly) However, a part of Toni was still clinging to that tree in your yard, waiting for the stars to align so that, one day, you would come along, and you would find her... (voice cracks) and you did. You did find her. And you found me. I... I-I thought, this whole time, it was my mom who's doing all of this. It seems to me that your mom and Toni are in cahoots on this one. Listen, Grace, there's something I've been trying to do for a very long time. Can I get your help? (♪♪♪) I've been wanting to pack up Toni's clothes and things, but I haven't been able to do it. If you want to keep any of it, you can. Really? Take your time. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (Noelle) Would you like something to drink? Water, coffee... beer, wine? Is it too early for wine? No, I think it's exactly wine'o'clock. Chardonnay? No. No, it's "Jack", but you can call me Chardonnay, if it makes you feel better. (laughs and snorts) You are much dorkier than I thought... (Jack laughs) But you made me snort a little, and I haven't snorted for a very long time. You know, Antonia and I had a running tally on who could make the other one snort the worst. Yeah. Who was ahead? Oh, I was. She... She just loved to laugh, and I knew what would make her snort. That's really sweet. These days, I've been getting the groan from Grace. Oh. - (groaning) "Oh, Dad!" - (laughing) She's so cool now. She's too cool for my corny Dad jokes. To snorts and groans. - (clinking) - To snorts and groans. Yeah, I... I can't bear to take down any of the photos with Antonia in them. Yeah, I hear you. It sounds really hard. And, uh, it's not about missing my ex. It's just... missing being together. Now I'm just a professor and a divorcee, and... I loved being a mom. I loved having a family. I, uh, I guess I kind of felt that, too. I miss... I miss my wife. I miss... being a husband. Now I'm a widower, I'm a "single dad". It's like... it's... it's... these terms that just make people feel sorry for you. It's the little things that I miss. Toni used to come up to me when I was in line at the grocery store, and she would just grab on to my leg. I miss her holding on to me. We're a couple of sad saps, huh? (laughs) Yes. To sad saps. (chuckles) (clink) Okay, tell me something good. When do you feel closest to Grace? (Jack) We played basketball the other day and that was the first time in a long time where we just had fun together. Oh, that sounds nice. It was nice. It brought back a lot of good memories. I miss... I miss... when she was little and I would just scoop her up, and I'd spin her around until she belly-laughed. I miss... God, I miss when she would run into my room during a storm... The little pitter-patter of her feet coming down the hallway. Your turn, Noelle. When's the last time you had fun? Today. Tonight. Just having the two of you here. My house doesn't feel quite so empty. Hmm. What are you doing Friday? You should come over for dinner. Friday night is "goulash night". Goulash? I don't know if I've ever had goulash. No? Well, then you have to come. (giggles) Grace says it's one of the four foods that I actually know how to make. - Really? - Mm-hmm. What are the other three? Oh, you're gonna have to find that out. Mm. But seriously, you should come. Sure. I mean, how can I say no to your famous goulash? Right? It's such a fun word to say, isn't it? "Goulash!" (both laughing) I guess so! (Jack) I think that's why I make it, 'cause it's a ridiculous word... (Noelle) It's a fun word! Yeah. (♪♪♪) Mr. Brown? Gary. Hi, Gary. Jack McCabe. Hey, thanks for coming in. Yeah, of course. I, um, I really... I really want to figure out how to support Grace. I know she's struggling, and I think the stress from the move, along with teen stuff, changing hormones, all that. It's a lot. Yeah. Grace is extremely gifted. She may be intellectually understimulated, and letting the social aspects of school distract her. How are things at home? It's been hectic lately. She found this balloon and this note in the tree when we were playing basketball, and that's turned into this whole thing. Grace plays basketball? Yeah. Yeah, she's pretty good, actually. Well, I mean, look, she's not the most athletic kid in the world, but she's got heart. Did you know I coach the freshman girls' basketball team? I did not know that. It just so happens that we're down a guard. We could use another player. I mean, she'd have to do a little tryout. Okay. I think she'd like that. It might help to incentivize Grace. All our student athletes are required to maintain a C-plus average. Right now, she's hovering at a "C". If she agrees to do the science fair, I can give her extra credit, help boost her grade, and we can discuss next steps. Okay. Yeah! I mean, that sounds great. Thank you. No problem. (Noelle) You guys really surprised me! I am so proud of all the effort and thought that you put into these essays. So, for next class, I want you to write your own sonnets about your own lives, in your own voices! See you Monday! Good job! (indistinct chatter) They seem more engaged. You want to get a cup of coffee? I can't. Brian's coming over for the divorce papers. Oh, so you signed them? No. But I'm ready to. Hey, Grace. Hi, Owen. Are you going to the cafe today? I have something I want to show you. Yeah, I'll be there. (hushed) Did that just happen? Owen barely talks to any girls. He talks to me. Unbelievable. Wait till Liv hears about this. (♪♪♪) (quiet chuckle) To be honest, I wasn't sure you were going to sign this. Signing these doesn't change what we had. We made a beautiful girl whose star just burned out too soon. I will always be so grateful to you for giving me Toni. (sniffles) (sighs heavily) Looks like you're starting to move on? No... I'm just trying to let go of the grief and find some kind of joy in the memory of her. I just wish there was a way I could hold on, somehow. I have something for you that I think might help. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) Thanks, Noelle. Yeah. I am not looking forward to Sunday. (exhales shakily) Hard to believe it's been two years. Are you gonna do anything? To celebrate the worst day of my life? No. You? I was gonna to go up to the cabin... she loved it there, but I got to be in Portland and then Seattle for work. Feel free to use it, if you want. I don't know. Maybe. Thanks. Take care of yourself. Hey, Grace. Where'd you get that jacket? From Toni's mom. You knew Toni, didn't you? (chuckles) You liked her? I did. I think she would've wanted you to have this. It was in her jacket pocket. She liked you, too. Thank you. Here. I'll make you a hot chocolate. (♪♪♪) (Grace) Noelle! Come on in. (Jack) Welcome, welcome. Smells wonderful. (Jack) All right. Hey. Hi. Dad, stop being so awkward. (awkward chuckle) I don't know what she's talking about. Anyway, welcome to dinner at the McCabes'. Thank you. It's nice to see you again, Chardonnay. No, it's Jack, but I love the comedy callback. I'm impressed. Wait a minute... Are you impressed, or are you Jack? (laughs) - (laughs) - Am I supposed to find these jokes funny when I'm older? Hopefully! Hey, would you mind taking Noelle's coat for her, please? Milady? Oh. Thank you. Would you like to open this right now? It looks delicious. - Sure. - All right. How can I help? Just make yourself at home. Sit down, get comfortable, get yourself ready for a delicious feast. Ahh. What actually is goulash? I'm glad you asked. "Goulash" is a traditional Hungarian meal. Dates back to the early-9th century. Ooh. Don't let it make you impressed. I saw him Google that earlier. What... Are you gonna tell her all my secrets? Fun fact... Do you know why the Hungarians first made goulash? No. Why? 'Cause they were Hungary. Oh, wow. That was so obvious. (Jack snickers) You're obvious. All right, let's see. Looks good. Here. Taste. Mm. It's delicious. You get my seal of approval. All right! That's it. We're ready to go. (laughter) Oh! (chuckles) Well, you might have to open up your own goulash restaurant. Really? Thank you! What... but what would I call it? "Jack's Goulash Garage". - Oh... - No, no, no... Grace's Goulash Garage... Alliteration? Uh-huh. Oh! "The Hungry Hungarian". That's a really good idea. You're not gonna do that. It's good, right? (laughs) If you don't mind, I'm going to excuse myself. I have a ton of homework to do. Are you serious? It's Friday. Never seen you do homework on a Friday. Well, if I'm going to try and make the basketball team, I need to get my grades in order. Okay. Night, sweetness. (Grace) Goodnight! Goodnight. ♪ Your eyes ♪ ♪ They sing louder ♪ ♪ Than I have heard in a while ♪ ♪ All the while ♪ ♪ The silence is keeping the peace ♪ ♪ Tell me ♪ ♪ Where did you come from? ♪ ♪ You're lovely ♪ ♪ How did you learn ♪ ♪ That life will... ♪ Thank you for this.

Thanks for coming in, Grace. Hey, check this out. If either of you can score with my girl Grace here guarding you, I'll give you 40 bucks... Dead serious. (mouths word) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (Jack clapping) Yeah, Grace! Defense wins championships. Thanks. Okay. You can come in for practice on Monday, Grace. But you need to get your grades up, if you want to play in games. Hope you come up with a good subject for the science fair. Okay, everybody. Let's welcome your new teammate, Grace. (crowd applauds) (phone rings) Hey, Jerry. Yeah. (sighs) Yeah. I'll meet with him. Sure. Yeah. Can't hurt. Thanks for setting that up. Oh, no, she didn't! My girl! Ah, I'm so proud of you! Can I call Noelle? I want to tell her the news. Yeah. (Noelle) Hello? - Guess what? - Hey! What? I made the team! You did? Congratulations! I knew you would. We'll have to celebrate. For sure. Thanks. Here's my dad. - Hi. - Hi. Hey. Are you around right now? I gotta ask you something. How about I meet you at King Lear Bistro? Okay, I'll see you soon. Great. Right. Do you want to come with me right now? No, thanks. I'm sweaty and I should probably shower. I might drop by the bookstore, if that's okay? Yeah, sure. You going alone? I made friends with a boy who works there. I'm sorry. What? It's not like that. He's nice. Hmm? Okay. I guess it's all right. Um, just stay for an hour. All right? Be careful. - Okay. - All right? Hey! Proud of you. (♪♪♪) - Hey. - Hi. Oh, I got you a coffee. Ah. Thank you. Mm! Everything okay? You seem stressed. I got a job opportunity in Portland. It starts on Monday, and the guy wants to meet me... tonight. Oh. Aren't there any jobs that are closer? It's a backup plan. I, uh, I can't go too long without work. I spent a fortune moving us up here. What about Grace? That's what I wanted to ask you about. So, um, is there any way you could watch Grace for me until I get back? (deep breath) Well, I'm going to our cabin tonight. Tomorrow is the two-year anniversary of Toni's passing. She loved it up there. Oh, my goodness! Right, right, right, right, right. - I'm sorry. - No. No. I-It's fine. No. It's just... I needed to do this. I have to tackle my grief head-on. You know? Yeah. Good for you. But, you know, I could take Grace with me. It's just that I'd be staying overnight. I couldn't... (stammers) I-I... no. I couldn't. That's... Wouldn't that be weird, if you had Grace with you? No. No, actually, I think having Grace there would ground me. You're wonderful. Thank you. You're welcome. So, uh, I have to go up to Portland today for work, but I talked to Noelle... She wants to take you to their cabin to spend the night, if you want to go. Yeah, that would be awesome. Yeah? Okay. She's gonna pick you up at two. Pack a bag... bring your homework, make sure your phone's charged, okay? - I will, I will. - All right. I love you! Bye! Bye. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) - Hi. - Hello! (Noelle laughs) Thanks for coming. I'd like to think I'll handle this weekend like a champion, but if I don't, I apologize ahead of time. You'll be okay. I feel like all of this is happening for a reason. Do you believe in coincidences? That they're random? Or do you think everything has a reason? (Noelle sighs deeply) I don't know. Both, maybe? Some things seem too perfect to be random, and others seem perfect because they're random. What do you think? Well, my mom used to tell me that when coincidences happen, that you couldn't explain, it was the angels playing with you. (chuckles lightly) Maybe. "There are more things on Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy." That's Hamlet, by the way. - (Grace laughs) - Okay, come on. Let's get on the road. (♪♪♪) Sorry to keep you waiting. Hi. Jack McCabe. Brian Webb. Nice to meet you. (♪♪♪) (Noelle, exhaling) We're here! Wow! It's like a postcard. Sorry about the snow. I forgot it takes longer to warm up here in the mountains. I should have warned you. No! I like it. No wonder Toni loved it here. Come on in. Oh. (Noelle exhales deeply) She looks so happy. (Noelle) It's one of my favorites. She was a literal tree-hugger. You know, I often try to imagine what she would look like now, at almost 16... what activities she would like, would she like the same food? Would she have a crush? Did you know that Owen Peters asked her to the winter formal? She wanted to say yes, but she didn't get the chance to tell him. (Noelle) She must have really liked him. I am so happy that she had a chance to feel these feelings. I wish she would've told me. She could have told me anything. Teenagers... it's kind of complicated. Sometimes I find myself saying the opposite of what I really mean to my dad. Mm. Like I... want somebody to blame for what happened to my mom. And he's the closest one. I know it's hard on him, and he needs me. And you need him. Your mother will always be a part of you, and I am sure that she would want nothing more than for you to be happy. (♪♪♪) Is it okay if I ask my dad to join us after his meeting? He would love it here. Of course, sweetie. Of course. Okay. Let's see what kind of things we have. (text alert chimes) Why? Everything okay? (ding) (ding) (♪♪♪) Hey, there. Hey, Jack. How'd that meeting in Portland go? They make you an offer? It went well. They need an answer by tomorrow. Well, I got some news that might make your decision easier. Our contract's been officially terminated. No more funding. You should take that job in Portland. There's got to be some other jobs in the area... Medford? Eugene? Probably not till the summer. Work's hard to come by right now. Portland's a great city. (sighs wearily) Grace is not gonna like this. All right. Thank you. (♪♪♪) (dryly) Really? Now you're just messing with me. (♪♪♪) (Grace) What do you mean, "new"? What about your current job? (Jack) So there is no "current job". They shelved the project and they terminated the contract. But the good news is that I got a new job at a great company in Portland. You already accepted it? I had... I had to let them know right away, or else I would have lost it. So, it starts on Monday. Hey. What's going on? What's going on is my dad wants to ruin my life. Grace, come on. I want to talk to you about this. I don't want to talk about it, and I don't want to move to Portland. Look, I know this is hard for you, and I'm sorry, but I'm out of options here. What about basketball? There's basketball in Portland. I'm going to bed. I'm sorry, Noelle. I'll see you in the morning. (Noelle) Okay. (Jack sighs) So you got the job? I see. (♪♪♪) Hi. Hey. Can I? Please. (♪♪♪) Was I wrong for taking that job? I don't know. It might have been good for you to talk to her about it before you made the decision. Maybe that's why she was hurt. You know, to be honest, I don't feel too good about you two leaving, either. What if Grace stays in Ashland with me? Uh... Till the end of school term? Grace is my daughter. She comes with me, no matter what. Night, Noelle. Jack... (♪♪♪) (strikes match) (♪♪♪) Hey. I'm not sure what I made here, but I don't think it's coffee. Industrial waste, maybe. Oh, wow, thank you. Looked like you needed that. Ah, I did. Did you sleep at all? Mm. A little. Good. I'm sorry I got defensive last night. The thought of living anywhere without Grace... she's all I have, and I would never leave her, no matter how "teenagery" she gets. You know, I'm the one that owes you an apology. I was out of line even offering... No, no, no, no, no. You weren't, you weren't. You were being kind. How are you feeling today? Better than I thought I would be. Having you and Grace here is comforting. Good. For the longest time, whenever I pictured Toni, it was... it was in her final moments. But seeing Grace here, it made me think of all the good times, and there were so many, many good times. In the summer, she would climb that tree... and jump off the dock... catch fireflies. And in the winter, we'd go sledding and make hot cocoa and play card games and... She filled this place with so much joy. That's beautiful. That's just... beautiful memories. I don't want to mourn her. I want to celebrate her. Yes! Yeah, I love that. Okay. What would... What would what would Toni want to do if she were here right now? Uh... (laughs) She would want pancakes. - Pancakes? - Yes! Pancakes happen to be one of the four foods that I make very well. (laughing) Really? We're doing this. What do you say? Let's do this. - Yeah? - Yeah. Let's do it. (♪♪♪) (reading quietly) "Energy cannot be destroyed..." Hey, how did you get them so fluffy? Wouldn't you like to know? I figured out my topic for the science fair project. Our body is made out of bones and flesh, but we're also made out of energy, right? Right. Energy can't be destroyed. It just changes form. That's what Einstein said. So my mom and Toni... they still exist. I want to do an energy conversion project to honor them. That's beautiful. I like it. Hey. I'm sorry about last night. I should've talked to you first before I did anything. I should've been honest with you about what was going on. You're not a little girl anymore. I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you. Okay, I want to talk with you more about it, but I've got a pancake that's burning over here, and Noelle's gonna tell us about the agenda for today. We have an agenda? Yes. We've decided to have a Toni Funday today, if that's all right with you. Sign me up. Great! So, when Toni was little, she had this challenge... She would stand out here and she tried to get the bubbles to float all the way across the pond, and then, sometimes, we would come out here together and we would see whose bubbles went the furthest. I used to love bubbles. Can I try? Sure. Of course. Here. (♪♪♪) Okay, you two. Quick bubble notes here. What, Mr. Expert? So... If you just... A little extra flick... a little extra flick, as you're going forward, you exponentially increase your bubbles. My dad's one of those guys who's annoyingly good at random things. - Oh. - Like blowing bubbles. And flipping pancakes. "Annoying". She already said "annoying". (laughs) Yeah. So those are your two things? Those are my... It was a good day for me! It was a good day. Hello. Brian? I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Jack? "Brian Webb". Of course! That's why you look familiar... From the photos in Noelle's house. Wait. You two know each other? Brian hired me for the job in Portland. - Oh! - (laughing) Yeah! So, what are you doing here, Jack? So I'm here... I'm here because of my daughter, Grace. And... it's all a long story. I thought you were gonna be out of town. How is Seattle? I... I canceled it. I wanted to come see if you were okay. Here, let's give them a little alone time. I just can't stop thinking about her. You were such a good dad. I'm glad you're finding your way through this. I wish I was there, but I'm not. I feel like I lost my purpose. (♪♪♪) Help others. What? I think I know how this is supposed to go now. You and Jack are supposed to work together... Just not the where-and-how that you thought. What are you talking about? Hey! Come on over, guys. What do you think they're talking about? I don't know, but I think we're gonna find out. (♪♪♪) (crowd applauding) Brian and I are thrilled to be here today, along with our project manager, Jack McCabe, his daughter, Grace, and all of you. We are here in honor of our late daughter, Antonia, to break ground on our brand-new, cutting-edge facility that will save the lives of countless children, and help to assist their families. "So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, so long lives this... and this gives life to thee."
