Police ! Don't move ! Hands on your head, right now ! Turn around ! On your knees ! Right now ! Hands on your head ! Don't move ! Get up ! THE UNKNOWN SAINT MAUSOLEUM OF THE UNKNOWN SAINT HOSTEL OF THE UNKNOWN SAINT Hello. Are you a pilgrim ? Pilgrim of what ? What else than our Unknown Saint ? No, I came to visit the area. I'm looking for a room, if you have one. I still have one. How many nights ? One. 150 dirhams. I'll give you the rest later. My wallet's at the bottom of my bag. Sorry... I need the full amount now. Are you sick ? - Excuse me ? - You came to be healed by the Saint ? Oh, no. I'm fine. I'm visiting the area. You've never seen dust and rocks before ? I'm searching for something. A scientist ! With your hair and beard, I thought you were sick, wacko or a scientist. Good luck ! Ask Brahim to forgive me. Don't worry. My father will understand one day. Here, a small gift for him. Father, come eat. What's in your hand ? A gift from Khalid. They've moved to the new village. Go ahead, I'll join you later. DISPENSARY The dispensary is closed. We're waiting for the new doctor. I am the new doctor. I'm the nurse who will assist you. I'll show you where you'll be staying. I haven't had time to finish painting. Anyway, here's my room. That one will be yours. Thanks. See you tomorrow at the dispensary. "WILCOME" Catch him ! Get him ! Don't let him move ! Catch the bastard ! Don't let him go ! They've said clouds will be crossing the south. Maybe it'll rain this time. It hasn't rained in 10 years. Besides, what if it did rain ? This is no longer earth. It's a bunch of dust and rocks. God bless you, Aziz. Hurry, you're late. Don't make the dog wait ! Yes, Father, I'll go right now. If only you could be like him. He works day and night. Wait ! Take this. Once you reach the hills, give it to the dog. He didn't eat this morning. BARBER SHOP Here's our scientist. It's not a joke. He's a real scientist. Come back soon, I'll put a gold tooth in. The scientist ! You first, you must be busy. Unlike these guys. They can wait. Beard or hair ? A bit of both. So what brings our scientist here ? Looking for oil ? That's it, we'll all be rich ? We're going to be Saudis ! No. I'm studying the nature and the rocks in the region. Help yourself ! It's all we've got here. Here's the village hero ! If those three agree, you'll be next. No one goes before our hero ! So, what happened ? - They stole the mausoleum ? - What can I say ? He was young, and tough and reckless. He thought he'd find a weak, old guard. But me and my dog were there ! The dog smelled him and jumped up. They were two ! One on each side. I ran after the first one, but he escaped. I didn't want to leave the mausoleum unguarded. I figured they had a plan. So, I ran back to the entrance. The other one was stealing from the fountain ! My dog pounced on him at once ! The thief was strong... And big ! He was twice my size. Fortunately, it went well. But we must be vigilant. They might come back, or send some other thieves. Times have changed. That cream is shit. You get the best I have. I need you. Send in the patients. Please, sit down. What's wrong ? I have headaches. When did it start ? 20 years ago. I see. Here. Whenever you have a bad headache, take one pill. You're fine. But I told you, I only cough on Mondays and Fridays. Take this. One pill every Monday and Friday before bed. Aren't there any men around here ? Yes, there are. They never get sick ? They're all sick. So why don't they come ? They'll never come here. You know, you can use more than one sentence. Yes, I know. So ? They won't come here. They get healed at the mausoleum. Does it work ? Sometimes yes, others no. And why don't the ladies go there too ? They do go. When they're sick. So what are they here for ? You're their hangout place. You... and the hammam. They go to the hammam once a week. You get all the other days. Father... I want to leave our village. You too ? You betray the land where you grew up ? You want to go to the new village with its bloody Saint ? I don't care about their Saint. I'm suffocating here. I want to get away from this dust and drought. Then leave ! What's stopping you ? I want you to come with me. - Do you want to pray ? - I have already, thanks. Keep the change. Thanks. You're too early and on the wrong side ! I haven't moved and I'm on the side you told me. Come down, man ! The guard called the cops. We need to leave. What are you doing all in black ? I'm Shiite. Come on, let me in. Relax. I won't say anything. I don't care about their Saint. Why did you do it ? I'm bored. When I heard them talking about the thief, I thought what a dumbass. If it was me, that asshole guard would never have got me. I understand. I'm bored too. Give me the good cream. I'll pay for the difference. I'm out. Brahim ! I know how to make it rain. We're going to pray. Just the two of us ? Plus my son and yours. My sons have left. There's only me, my wife and my daughter. The number doesn't matter. God will hear us. With God's blessing, may the Unknown Saint show mercy on you. May God make you walk again. What's wrong ? I cough at night. Every night ? No, not every night. Do you cough during the day too ? Yes, I do. Okay, but... do you cough day or night ? Only at night. And sometimes during the day. Any fever ? No. No, not now. When you cough at night, do you have a fever ? Do you perspire ? Yes, if there are too many blankets. Okay. Is it serious, doctor ? Very serious. I'm fed up. You'll get used to it. - How long have you been here ? - Too long. Give me that. It's strong. But good. Thanks. I've been working on the dosage for years. We need a solution for that damn guard and his dog. We'll kill him. We wait until he's without the dog. And we stab him. The village will be crawling with cops. With our records, we'll be the first suspects. We'll set the village on fire. Everybody will freak out. They'll run to save their things. We take our money and run. What do you say ? I don't want anyone killed. And we're not burning the village. I'm not a criminal. What are you then ? A scientist ? I'm a thief, not a criminal. I only need this one gig and I'm set for life. That money is mine. I went to jail for it. Now it's mine. Sit down. Thinking's not your thing. You're kidding, right ? Remember what they called me in jail ? Ahmed the Brain. It was sarcastic, you're an idiot. Are you sure this is where you buried the money ? Yes, I saw the tomb today. I remember it perfectly. That's a problem. People think a saint is buried there. Some have even witnessed his miracles. Stealing money is okay for me. Digging a grave, is borderline. But profaning a saint's tomb, is too much. There's no saint there. Only my money. Their miracle stories are bullshit. I have an aunt, poor woman... The doctor said he couldn't cure her. They took her to a holy place in our region. She bathed in holy water for 3 days. The fourth day she was cured. I swear to God. Do you pray ? Come eat. In a while. The weather report's coming. - What happened ? - A car hit him on purpose. Where were you ? What good are you for ? What good are you for ? If he dies, I'll bury you with him. And your mother too ! It's all her fault. She gave me a useless kid like you. I don't know what's wrong. When I was young, I made the bread. I cooked and cleaned. I did everything. Absolutely everything. I'd fetch the wood, the water, and make the bread. I could handle any task. All by myself. Now, I have no strength left. Young ? When was that ? Shortly after the Green March. When King Hassan II made his speech. I grazed goats, cows and sheep. I grazed everything. Take these pills. Keep them. Whenever they replay Hassan II's speech, take one. Doctor, please save him ! He's all I have. You can leave. You too. What did you do ? I got rid of the problem. Are you crazy ? The whole village is on alert. It's a dead dog in a dead village. They'll forget about it. It's the mausoleum guard's dog ! Two robberies and now this. Did anybody see you ? Nobody. What about the car ? I hid it. So ? Who's the Brain ? What brain ? You weren't even able to kill it. What ? The dog is still alive. Thank God ! It was weighing on me. You were ready to kill the guard and set the village on fire ! It's not the same. It's just a poor animal. He didn't hurt me. Dogs are good guys. I like them, I understand them. I wanted to show you what I could do. You had one instruction to follow. Do nothing before I tell you. I'm the brain and you're the brawn. Come in. He's going to live. But he's lost his teeth. He only has two left. I'll find a solution. Hassan ! Did you hear that ? Yes. It's thunder. It's going to rain ! Go back to sleep. It's the workers widening the road. With the lousy pay they get, they wouldn't work this late. It's thunder. God answered our prayers. You did all you could. I curse the day they found that Saint. It made them leave their land. It's the drought you should curse. Let's go. Are you coming or what ? I have a bad feeling. We should wait until tomorrow. A bad feeling ? The guard is alone. Let's go get our money ! Are you sure the money's there ? We won't dig up a saint's body ? Stay here if you want. I'm getting my money. Okay, you'll give me my share later. Your share of what ? You don't come, you get nothing. I'll do it tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll be ready. It'll be safer. The dog is gone, but the guard looks pretty strong. And you're not in great shape. Together, we're sure of succeeding. It's not as risky. What do you say ? Shit, why did I call you ? To help you. Damn mausoleum ! Go back to your land, people ! Go back ! Get your hands off me ! Damned Saint ! You need to eat something. Go see what's going on. It's some sort of ceremony. For how long ? Three. Three nights. How is Brahim ? Not well. That's why I came. Brahim ? Brahim ! How do you feel ? He's been like that for several days. I don't know what to do. I need to talk to you. Talk then. Alone. Can you go outside for a minute ? What about them ? Don't worry, they're cool. I need you to make teeth for my dog. Are you kidding me ? Dog teeth ? It's just teeth ! I'm begging you, he's everything I have. Otherwise he'll die. I can't, I only make gold teeth. They cost a fortune. It's not a problem. I'll find the money. We have to save him. Usually, I pull a tooth and make a gold one. For people, I'm used to it. I know the size. But for a dog... I need his old teeth. I have some left. And I'll go see those bums who hang out around the mausoleum. I'll pay one to pull a few more from a stray dog. The doctor will help us. He's one of us now. Go on. Call the client back in. Here. Take one every evening. Here are the teeth. And the money ? You'll have the rest in two days. The time to sell my land. You still bored ? They'll freak out when they see that tomorrow. It's a miracle ! "No one can steal from the Saint." It's a message for us from the Saint ! Find the scientist. He'll figure it out for us. Let's go, people ! What's better ? Like this ? Or like this ? I'm going to town to get us some food. Don't move. There he is ! You, scientist ! Hey there, scientist ! Hey, wait ! That's enough. Go home now. Go on ! I'm going alone so you don't mess up again. Wait for me here. When I come down, you start the car and we split. Get it ? Got it. You're the Brain. We'll come back tomorrow. I have a bad feeling tonight. - It's okay ? - Yes. Smile ! Now it's my turn. THE UNKNOWN SAINT
