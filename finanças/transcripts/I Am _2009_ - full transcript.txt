And when he stepped out of the boat, immediately a man out of the tombs with an unclean spirit met him. Mark 5.2 That's me. I'm 18 and I'm into theatre. I'm starting a story about my friends. Our story is closely tied to my friend, nicknamed Rom. The Magadan city prosecutor has a serious interest in him. I've got to say that it's not without reason. And the guys from the prosecutor's office are really fierce. An eye for an eye, you son-of-a-bitch! A tooth for a tooth. Stop, that's enough. I'm tripping my ass off. I am This is Rom. He's in the nut-house for murder. Now he's stoned so the orderlies are turning into blond chicks. Where is he? He'll show up soon, the demon. These are my older friends and the boy is me. Hold it, OK. The guys are on all sorts of stuff, some on pills, some on the needle. - Is it tied up? - Yeah, it's cool. Cut the shit! Chera and Paris smoked themselves blind. So from up there with his beard he jumps through the bars to here. And he's like, "Chill out! I'm at the base." They all fuckin' showed up! Safron took my watch yesterday for the evening and now it's gone. It's American. A fuckin' Iron Man. Carp, go to hell with your watch! It's not yours. Don't piss me off! He sold it and he's probably already stoned, you jerk. Kid keeps trying to swallow the lump, see? Look at my throat. I'm trying to swallow saliva. But there's none. Just a lump the size of a tractor. Soon I'll start hallucinating. See my dilated pupil? It's all from the taren. Don't sweat it. Kid. It'll be gone by tomorrow. So, demons already wasted since morning! Here are the disembodied hands. I'll grab and hang 2 towers on an island! They'll fall down and buckle like they're on smack! In the year coming after 2! And one after the other will go down into the fire! Down, damn it, down! Fucked up first thing in the morning. Rom, Heil Hitler! How's your health? Hare Krishna, assholes! We're gonna lay some good shit on you now. Enough roaches for 10 joints, and some speed. Paris, I'll portray you kindly when I'm in front of the Father. And who's that dude? He's with us. He's... What was his name? Well, should we do a hit or what? One sec, Rom. Catch! Damn it! One sec. Why are you being so stupid? Are you like this with your squeeze, too? Let me. Stop! Hold the bag. Just relax. What's with you? Let me throw it. You'll miss. Get lost, you moron! I'm serious. Let the little devil toss it! Kid... Here, Kid. Right in the eye! Shit! That's how I met Rom for the first time. In Rom's pockets was everything humankind might ever need. And he generously dispensed and sowed. I grew up. It was time to dodge the draft. So I crossed the threshold of the Sevastopol loony bin. I'm on a tile floor. My jeans are flying off. And my Keds. They rip the beads off my arms. They break into bobbers. They pull the leather bracelets off my wrists. They ripped the cross off my chest. I used to be stronger than them. I would've destroyed those dorks. I didn't expect this right away. They broke my nose in the process. A salty taste in my mouth. It's blood. I was almost a pro in judo. That's alright. I'll crush you anyway. I'm here. It's a prophylaxis. The day I arrived they found lice in the nut-house. Enough spraying! This is the loony bin's head doctor. She decides if you go to the army or get Article "Schizophrenic". The toilet. I'm going in. There are people in front of me. Bulged deformed skulls. I'm lighting up my filterless smokes. Pal, save me the smoke. Why are you here? - Voices. - What voices? In my head. What are they saying? Sometimes they say that time will stop at 12... Sometimes that there will be a bloody wedding. I remember that window. I've been here, but of course it was on the other side of the bars... when we'd visit Rom with presents. Where is he? He'll show up soon, the demon. We all wanted to be like Rom. Well? I'm not sure. Did Pavlik get locked up? Yes, tomorrow we're going to the court. Looks like 15 hard labor. The pigs pinned some unsolved cases on him too. God rest his soul. Chera, tell Totzel it's going down. When I get to the city, let the cops have the day off! The third Sunday will be rock-n roll. I got you, Rom. I'll Jericho it with 2 horns! Cool! That's it! Dismissed! Well, punks, "Come together!" Rock-n-roll! Arkhip, damn it! Let's move it you fucking junkies. Take the beer! Kid's tripping. Arkhip got off on poppy so he was zoned out a lot. That's why they called him thick and poppy-eater. Dry-mouth, dammit. I'm comin'. Chief, give us a lift to the city. We'll take care of you. Where are you from? - We were visiting a patient. - Which one? What, you think you know him? Well, Rom. Get in. I'll take you anywhere you want. It's on me. Great! Hey, get into the chariot! An old lady's going with you, but she gets off soon. The toilet's long with partitioned johns along the wall. I'm walking towards the one closest to the window. Access to the bowls is open. There are no doors. I changed my mind. I haven't gone to the toilet in a week. I need to get accustomed here. To know who's the boss and who's holding. Nobody's in a chair smashing a punching bag with a stick. Fuck, everything's different. Yesterday I finished Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Yesterday I thought, "Dammit, I'll show you rock 'n roll." But I still did a little. So you're Adolph, got it? And you all scream "Zig Heil!" and raise your arm like this. Zig Heil! Exactly. And if need be, lift your arm and "Zig Heil!" Zig Heil And you're Adolph. Forman got it all wrong too. Nicholson would have been laid out in a second after his first tirade. If I find Safron I'll kill him. Give me the beer. Arkhip, give me the beer! No need to scream. Here! Damn! I need to call my mother. You said she died. And here come the hallucinations from the taren. Kid is totally trippin'. Look what he's doing. Kid, what is it? Sit. Chill out. What are you doing, Kid? Calm down, sit. Paris, don't space out! Keep your eyes on him. You fed him, so now you watch him till he comes down. Arkhip, didn't you dodge the draft at that same nut-house? - And? - How is it in there? I was dodging with Tukhetz and Maket. They drafted Maket, but me and Tukhetz got a 7B. Is it some schizo thing? My Sashka's going to dodge in there too. If he can manage. They're tough in there. And I served like a moron. 3 years in a sub. Why didn't you dodge? I screwed up. They called me up and I went. But now you can't get a driver's license. Come on, Tukhetz drives, right? I don't know where he got it. If you're nuts they shouldn't give you a license. It's a fuckin' car! What if you hit someone? You won't be charged because you're a moron. No, something's wrong here. Totzel freakin' flies. I almost pissed myself. We drove 120 to Yalta on a serpentine. How can you dodge guaranteed? You can slash your wrists on the street and call for an ambulance. For a suicide attempt they'll take you to the nut-house for sure. They'll examine you there and... no matter what they'll register you at a psycho dispensary. That's how I found out how to dodge the army. I slit my wrists for the first time when I was 13. Where are you going to? To "The Key" on Revolution. Then wait. We have to deliver the first passenger to the base. Hi, Mom, we're here. This is Strawberry Fields, a nurse in the visiting room. Let me make a call. She's got a mole on her chin like a ripe strawberry. The time for calls is up. I need to tell my parents where I am. Move your foot and arrange it with the head doctor. Where is he? It's a she! You under-aged dick! She's Yelizaveta Ivanovna Kalitka! Foot! I'll call the orderlies and they'll cut you into shreds, scum! Where's the head doctor? Tomorrow, after 11. It's lunch soon! They can strip it from you! This is George. Why are you in? - Why are you in? - They overfed me salt. - Really? - Yeah. - Who? - First at home. - Your wife? - Yes. Bitch. She's a skanky whore. She locked me up here. Quiet. What happened? She instigated them at the plant canteen. I'd turn away and they'd pour salt on my plate. At work and at home. Once I saw her pour half a bag on my plate and not even stir it. It was when I was making a quadraphonic system. What's that? It's when sound comes from the floor, walls and a speaker above. Wait. I'll check if they pour any. Just anything but borsch! Come on over. What they'd put in for sure is bromine so you can't get it up. And George, he's just a total nut. George would put on these shows every time they served borsch. I won't fall asleep in here. I landed in a ward with real psychos. Sasha, have you sucked off Petrush? Yes. Petrush, have you sucked off Sasha? Yes. Did you try it simultaneously? This is Friedrich. That's what I call hierarchy. A 100% blow-job. In Japan nobody comes and that's how they prolong their lives. Because protein is life. So they don't share their sperm and save it all for themselves. And they call a dick a "jade stem". That's how those who mix up dick with Zen live. I don't see you... Teacher. Oh, my legs. The broken legs of a superhuman. How did you end up in here, Zarathushtra? I know how. But I don't quite understand about you. Well, tell me. I'm a translator. I translated something so they locked me up. From which language? From German. But I know Latin, Hebrew and Greek too. What did you translate? Didn't translate, deciphered. I don't know if you're ready to hear it but I know you must. It's up to you. I was in Tibet. A lot of things opened up to me there. Let's do it like this... If there are no signs from above by tomorrow then you'll find out. But if there are signs, you won't find out what you have to. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. I haven't had someone to talk to in a long while. Look at the legs of a superhuman. Later I found out that Friedrich was KGB who went crazy. He had heart problems and his legs were broken in some squabble. They put downers in the food. No doubt. My head feels like a box. Through the rays I see a woman's profile. A nurse. Nice uniform. Nina's look #30 in my direction. I tilt my head. I need to examine her face. My eyes got used to the sun. With the back lighting I grabbed it. Nina's really pretty. Is it her, the woman of my dreams? Zig Heil! This is Kalitka. She came for me. Behind her is some other dork. Judging by his clothes this dude is obviously not a nut. I asked him if he knows about Rom. How the fuck do I know who you are? You'll find out soon. Listen, change your threads. Tell your mother to bring something. You look like these idiots. Get a warm-up suit or something. Zig Heil! Good morning. So I went to Tibet to the Teacher. He lives in total darkness in a cave there but sees everything. Disciples come to him from all over the world. No fire, no flashlights, no nothing. He lives off the moisture from stalactites and a hemp seed a day. Whoever endures 14 days starts to see. I got my sight back in a week. It's like in the movie "Predator" with Schwarzenegger. Instead of people you see spots of light and energy flying by. Besides me there were 7 in there and they were all women. Well, demons?! When Rom was in the nut-house everything went by his rules. Doctors turned a blind eye to him. Nurses gave him morphine, chifir and spice-cakes gratis. Listen, did you hear about Rom? He's supposed to show up. - What, you know Rom too? - We've hung out. They are about to bring him here from the Simferopol nut-house. He's got a year left. If you know Rom you're as good as in. He's my godfather. I mean... I'd lie under a train for Rom. There was a lot of talk about Rom but nobody knew anything for sure. Some say he was born in prison and spent his whole life there. Some say he was a shaman in Yakutia. But I knew that Rom went to university... and went on an expedition with his geology friends. The gold mines of Magadan captured his imagination... and he remained in Taiga for a few years. That's where he had a little bad luck. In Taiga, Rom lived at a rig with Vityusha, a stud driller. Cigs and supplies were thrown down to them from a helicopter. And Rom loved someone in Magadan. Her name was Linda. - Well, where's the money? - In a week for sure. Show me your hands! Are we going to work? Besides Rom, the prosecutor's son, a cop named Edik, loved Linda. My kitty, I'll still break you down. What do you want, huh? If you want I'll take you down south to live by the sea. Edik, you're such a dick that it would be easier to give it to you... then explain why I don't want you. Then give! Then you'll be damned. You're using Rom's lines. How did he win you? Is he some wizard? Fuck! Witch! You're a dog, Edik. I'll tear your Rom into pieces. I'll turn him into shit. Just let him butt in. That's it, done deal! Let me make a call. Your folks know everything already, calm down. I need them to bring a toothbrush and paste. I told them everything. Calm down. When are they coming to visit? You'll have guests today. Calm down. I hate waiting. How come no one's here? What no one? You told me they'd come today. Who? Guests. What guests, dear? Who told you that? - You told me! - We didn't talk today, dear! - We talked, you lousy twat! - Quiet! - Are you scamming me, you bitch? - Stop screaming! I'll tell you. She's waiting over there, outside the window. Go look. That's my sister. - They won't let me in! - For long? Since 5:00. They promised to give you what I brought! It's 7:30 now and visiting time's till 8:00! Let her in! It's a cleanup day! Keep screaming! Lyosha, I brought you soup and cigarettes. Why won't they let you out? Because they're all morons in here, damn it! On one side are idiots, on the other doctors. Both are cretins. Get your hands off me! Did you hear me? Lyosha! When will they discharge you? It's aminazin. It paralyzes the body. It starts off like the first second of weightlessness in an elevator. Vasya? How could he? Walk on water. Who? Who?! Well you know, like... you need to believe and walk. You know? Go on, read. After he had dismissed them, he went up on the mountain to pray. When evening came, he was there alone. But the boat was already far from the land. buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. During the night Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. "It's a ghost," they cried out in fear. But Jesus said, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid." "If it's you, Lord, tell me to come to you on the water," said Peter. "Come," He said. Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus. But he saw the wind, was afraid... and sinking cried out, "Lord, save me!" Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?" One more time. The ending. When he got out. Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus. But he saw the wind, was afraid... and sinking cried out, "Lord, save me!" Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?" The time has come. And the meat goes into a hole. They'll turn you into shit. Don't fuss. You've got... What? I remember the yard covered with a blanket of snow. You were standing by the door of a blue taxi. Snowflakes glistened on your eyelashes. Your tired but tender look spoke of love. Everything passes in parting. Your feelings have faded away. I still feel pain in my heart when I think about you. The years will fly by, but I will still remember you with love. - Who are you? - John Lennon. Untie him and send him to therapy. I've almost finished. You'll carry out what you must carry out. I'll show them! I'll get them! I'll expose them! Bastards! Jerks! Something happened? They put me here for nothing! My mother-in-law called for them and said that I have DTs, bitch! It's her who has DTs, the bitch! It's OK. I'll go complain to the doctor. They're gonna get it! I'll show them all! I'll sue them! I'm not that kind of guy. Listen, asshole. What are you squealing about? What? I'm sick of you all! Where's the chief? Come here. I'm still smoking! I'm not going anywhere! McMurphy in Cuckoo's Nest was pulling shit for about a month. In our nut-house they'd put a lid on people right away. The moustache was turned into a jellyfish in a week. And there were no Indians here. Rom was marched from nut-house to nut-house all over the country. I know he's somewhere on his way and I'm waiting like never before. My older friends dragged me everywhere with them. We would hang out at the "Golden Key", by the store on Revolution. Hi. Medicate while your young so you won't be sick when you're old. Where's Corpse? Gena Corpse is the head punk. Kuyna, are you totally wasted? Who's that? Finch is totally tripped out. Do you see how Kid's rockin' out? Cool! If you get him high he'll tell you stories that'll crack you up. Rook, show us what you did. Come on, it hasn't healed yet. Come on, show us! Come on, show us! "Don't wake me up" - Foma hasn't seen you yet. - What about him? He'll tell you a story. It's totally prison style. Corpse, you should have put a dragon on his ass. Or a stoker with a shovel. On one bun he shovels and he throws it on the other. So your ass goes this way and that and the stoker works. Hey, they say you can do voices. How about mine? Let's do a hit and then we'll see. Let's go. Natasha, let's go to my place. Damn it, Arkhip! I can't just wham bam. I wish you'd set me up with something right for it for once. Yeah, but if it was Lucik, you'd go in a second. Listen, I owe Lucik, but I don't want to deal with him! He's got one the size of a 2 by 4. I'd be walking like a turtle for a week afterwards. I heard Rom got released? They say he's been in the city since morning. Do you have anything? We have something. "Mom brought milk as smooth as silk." Chera, give the guys some milk. Wicked fresh. It's still warm. Not too much. We made it nuclear. Watch out, Lyonya. We just had a sip and barely made it here. I missed the turn 5 times. Gesha! Here's the resin. Not now. I'm on cyclodol and weed. It would flatten me. Rom's gonna come and bring some smack. Sanya, tell them how we cooked it. It was just... Yeah, it's like, you know... We made milk with some crappy grass that had no kick. We couldn't do it at my place. Totzel was partying in the kitchen. So we went to Schooly's. We were filthy. We rode 200 km on Sanya's clunker. Yeah, like dirty devils! So we get there and worked it out. He says, "Let's do it quick before my parents get back." I chop up the grass, throw it in the milk. and turn on the propeller so it won't stink. Schooly cooks a mean milk. We're tokin' the whole time so the brakes are on. My parents are back. He yells, "Throw it in the john!" I scream, "We'll make it!" Then all hell broke loose! Shit, it's barely straining! Come on, quicker! Wring out the resin! It's hot! Give it to me. Where to? Pour it the fuck out! This is my mom. Once after school I found some pot I hid under my bed... spread out neatly on my desk. On top of it my mom put the book "Green Pharmacy". Son, you take after your grandpa. I'd never would have imagined you'd study herbs. So, you've made up your mind. You want to be an herbalist? Yes, Mom, I'm going to enter medical school to be a pharmacist. Smart idea. Inventing medicines is worth dedicating your life to. Are you going to become a professor, like your grandpa? I'm proud of you, my alchemist. Well? Did you expect anything like this? How are they treating you? Stuffing you with medicine, yeah? Everything's fine, Mommy. I just didn't sleep. Didn't sleep? They say you had a fight yesterday. - No, don't listen to that. - No, I'll listen. - Don't listen. - I will listen. Now I'll listen to you. Tell me everything. - Come on, Mommy. - What "Mommy"? Did you bring me the books? I did. Here. Hoffman. Becket. Lord of the Rings. Everything you asked for. You want to supply me for 5 years? Stop it. You're a fast reader. Well? Was it worth it? It even smells like a morgue here. Yeah, the patients are decaying slowly. We could have made you any paper, any deferment from the army. Mom, it looks like I've met my love in here. When are you meeting my psychiatrist? Tomorrow. If they ask, tell them I had a few unrecorded concussions. Tell them I fell off a motorcycle. I'll say it if I need to. I brought you some jam and pancakes. Each jar is labeled with your name. OK. Thanks. Mom. Listen, don't be a fool. OK? And don't bring a girl back from the asylum. Alright. See you soon. What's her name? Nina. She's normal, Mom, and educated. Listen, Chera, could you turn profile? What for? Please. What, are you tripping? OK, don't bother. That's good enough. What do you mean "good enough"? Sanya, what are you talking about? Come on, give it up. I just like you more in profile, that's all. What? Well, I love you in profile but face forward just a bit. Turn. So all together I don't work for you? You're just different in profile... beautiful. And just not quite straight on. I'm gonna go study. How's that? To become a bus driver. They pay while you train. 3 months and you're on the track. Chera in profile -- that was Sanya's happiness. Safron took my watch yesterday for the evening and now it's gone. It's American. A fuckin' Iron Man. I was raised in a decent family, but the street was more interesting. Do you know where Safron disappeared to? Him and Lenka went to pick up uncle. It's season. We called marijuana "uncle". - Let's do a hit and then we'll see. - Let's go. It's real uncle from Chuisk. Corpse, I know you won't give me skank. But you forgot yourself. - What's that mean? - Do you know the word PUTZ? The director of the zoo was upset. No one was coming to the zoo. He wrote and hung notes all over the city: "Please Use The Zoo". Abbreviation: PUTZ. Get it? - How do you do that? - I can do a lot more. - Yeah? What else? - I can disappear. - How? - Easy. 1, 2... and I'm not here. Come on, cut the crap. Let's bet for all of the uncle in your pocket. A man without Christ is a putz. Crazy shit... Yes! Yes! Yes! Linda, Linda, where's Linda? There's no Linda! Where's Linda? Linda, my girl... What are you doing? Hey! What are you doing? Sorry, I almost found it. You're gonna find your dissected body now! What are you doing? What did you lose, hello? Sorry, I already found it. That's Chernobyler. He scarfs on the mattress bows. I solved God's writs. Masons tablets. I drew the signs of the Second Coming on the rocks. Rom already knows. I couldn't get it to destination, there was no parlementaire. Now a lot depends on you. How can I help? I know they'll give you a pen. You'll pass it to me. I'll get paper myself. There's a guy in Strelka who can knock you over with a look. You'll pass the message to him. Good day. So, let's start. So, you're writing plays. What are they about? - Depends which one. - What? Depends on which one. Let's say the last one. "Vomit Rain?" It's a radio play. Why do you see the world in such dark colors? Were you beaten as a child? I don't remember. Alright. Your main character is a butcher. It takes place over 3 days. On the 3rd day he chops himself up. I have a question. Why is your week only 3 days, and what are the lead's motives for such an act? Who do you see as the audience for your work? If they played it on the radio who would be listening? Everyone who listens to "Radio Mayak". Why are you so sure? Because humankind lives in fear. And what is humankind scared of? Of life itself. that's why it lives. Which forms of life are humans scared of? The inevitability of reproduction. And your butcher overcomes this fear by reproducing himself? Dissecting. Did your mom read the play? She listened to it. I recorded it on a cassette. Did she like it? Ask her. So you recorded the monologue of the butcher in the first person? Yes. Tell us, do you improvise? What other ending could you come up with right now? Just some other ending. Shut your pie hole! Get lost and die, you bitch! Well, just some other ending. The butcher asks to be given to hungry dogs to eat. Each part of his body is talking, his head's in a motorcycle helmet, his body... All of this is for the radio? How many concussions have you had? None. Turn it off. I really pity these orderlies and nuts. Because I knew that I'd break out of here in a month, but they'll never get anywhere. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Bastards! Change the record. I've heard enough. Did the misfit come to? Let's see. We gave him a hefty dose of haloperidol and sulphur. You'll off him before his time's up. If he won't fight we won't off him. See what he did yesterday? Where am I? Home. I warned you. Yes! Yes! Yes! Linda, where's Linda? There's no Linda! Where's Linda? Today, my dears, you're in for an interesting lesson. You'll get a unique opportunity to not disassemble, but rather assemble, a human. So, frau-surgeons, let's begin. Friedrich died today. When he slit his veins and wrote God's writs on the wall in blood. Nina calmed him down with a double dose of sulphur. His heart couldn't bare it. That's some overdose. Get lost! Load him up. I'll go start the van. Help! Don't just stand there! Do you remember this guy? His name is Zakrya. He dodged prison by claiming insanity. Now we're cooking chifir in the cozy nut-house kitchen. They came to me and said this ganja was schwag. Just total crap. But, I know how they cut it those freakin' junkies. That's hot! Yes, I didn't finish telling about Rom, about his dark Magadan past. That story took place 10 years ago. What? You son-of-a-bitch. The pusher sold out and cut the shit with Leponex, a sedative. That's why Rom fell asleep there before he had a chance to get off. He's been sitting like that for 3 days already. He doesn't eat, doesn't drink and doesn't blink. You shouldn't have taken Rom. People say he's clairvoyant. You shouldn't raise your hand against him. And people know him. So he's a believer? Well, he can pay for his belief, right? Tomorrow is Mom's birthday. Will you go to the cemetery? Look, bitch! You see that? Got a good view? And how's it now better? You demon shit! Hello! Have you gone deaf? Always stay in reach! Bring her here. Well, let's start. What did I want? Basically nothing special. I just wanted you to be my girlfriend. Not somebody else's. You could've been friends with anybody, I would've allowed that. But girlfriend? Just mine. I would have taken you to the sea. I told you about the sand and all that. And you? How did you treat me, Linda? You decided you wouldn't be my girlfriend. That's fine. But you called me a dog! What's that all about. Linda? That's just not right. I don't like when things aren't going right. I mean the way I don't want them to go. And I can't stand dogs! It's like when they ask you on the street, "How's things?" And I'm nodding like, "Everything is fine, thanks, I'm doing great." But I'm tense as shit inside! And I just want to say, "Things suck! My fuckin' things suck!" Things aren't things if we do them together! Everybody's got his own things and does them his own way. Right? Am I right, Linda? And now I'm doing my thing. So, here are 2 shovels. The ground is soft. You'll dig your own graves. You'll lay in one if you behave well. Well? Come on. Wake up your girlfriend. Come on. Linda!!! Here you go. God's ways are unfathomable. The court ruled that Rom was crazy. They sent him away for 10 years of mandatory psychiatric treatment. Why don't you want me? Because it happens in every movie. I don't understand, what movies? All of them. They screw, understand? And what? And the Universe records each of our words. You know where you can go with your Universe. Either you play with me or you're a real moron. I told my mom about you. What did you say? That you're on the list of people not allowed into Tibet. What else did you say? That you're a person who doesn't just take but can also give, can give a part of yourself for somebody else's sake. You don't like me? You know how they do it there? They'll show you this very moment you're playing now on the screen. You'll want to turn back time so it won't have happened. But it'll be too late. That's the movie I'm talking about. So, you're telling me all this right now... and we're really being shot? I'm telling you, they shoot non-stop. And where's the camera right now? There. Cool. I always wanted to be an actress. So, stinker, you wanted one on one? Come on, comm zu mir. Listen you Tibetan louse. If I put you down you'll fuck off forever. No problem. And what if I put you down? You'll die trying. Yes! Yes! Yes! No! No! No! I don't like winter, damn it! Kid, in winter we're like railroad ties. Like black branches flowing down along the track! But in spring, fuck if it don't turn green! No, Kid, winter sucks. Spring... Green spring... And what's the first thing you do in spring, Timur? I know you thought your name's not Timur. You thought right, but no one gives a fuck, Timur! So what's the first thing you do in spring? Right, you own up. And what else? Lay out a spread on the table and fast! Right, Kid? Yes. Whatever shit happens everyone croaks anyway. The scum, the cane, the finches, the tag-alongs at the bus stop... From here and there they'll climb out of the water. and everyone's fuckin' toast! No offense, bro. Why are you taunting me like a barren fig-tree? Come on! Let beauty live forever. You'll wrap kilometers of guts and sew on heads. You won't have enough tears. You'll cry them all out. But there's no escape from that winter. Right, Kid? Fuck knows. Hear me, Lord! Praised art Thou. I glorify You with my whole being, with every second. Lord, I miss You so much. I shot this demo real and I'm sending it to You. And when You received it, and as you're watching it right now, Lord, forgive this sinner, for the temptation he passed to the world... which is oozing out from this screen... into the souls of those looking at me right now. DON'T WAKE ME UP Based on a real story Practically all of these guys ended up as expected: some died, some landed in the nut-house forever, some got locked up in prison, some overdosed, some got killed. In any case their lives either stopped or turned into a mess. By some miracle I survived. Probably so that I could tell this story. And Chera became a bus driver. Galina Petrova Avenue.
