The next little tune I'd like to dedicate to the person that it was written for, it's a little boy called Dylan somewhere. This tune came about when he was just about one day old. ("The Clap" by Yes) (applause) - Hope you all are having a good time. Next song we're gonna do is a song from our latest album. It's a song we originally didn't name when we were recording it. Hope you like it. A song called And You And I.
