Coming Sir, would you like some wine? Yes, as much as you have Would you like steamed buns as well? Yes, 20 to 30 pieces Instructor Wu, no one's around Let me take away your cangue so you'd eat comfortably This is a requirement of the law, how could that be? Instructor Wu Since we've left the city you'll have to listen to us Don't worry I'm comfortable eating like this Here's the wine Madam, where's your husband? He's still on a business trip Aren't you feeling Ionely? You must be joking You can relax under the tree after the drink and it's alright to rest in my place also if you want Thanks This wine is not so strong do you have anything better? Let us try it We do, but it's a bit mixed I like it that way Here you are This is good wine Madam Such good wine should go with some meat Sure Good wine Come... Even you are smart, you've drunk my wine... Xiao Er, Xiao San, come out Carry him inside Useless, I have to do everything myself Damn kid, attack Go ahead Wait, you seem to possess good kung fu what's your name please? I am Wu Sung The famous tiger killer It's my honour to meet you Are you this lady's husband? Yes, I am Zheng Qing, this is my wife They call her The Witch Suen Er Niang How has she offended you? Allow us to apologise Sorry about what happened Please forgive me for being rude This time you... If he hadn't joked about me I wouldn't have done that I am an upright hero how would I hassle decent ladies I think she wants to steal my bag so I speak something to lure her to do it You are renowned for killing your sister in law and her adulterer Instead of suffering in jail why not kill these two sheriffs and seek refuge as a robber in the mountains? I only fight tough guys These two sheriffs have cared for me so I can't take their lives Please wake them up Alright Great wine, remember this place we'll drink again when we pass by here Too easily drunk We haven't had much, why do we feel like getting drunk? It's late if you don't mind you could spend the night here my wife could cook some food and I could drink with you Please eat... Please, make yourself at home Cheers Right Here's to you You have served me well in these 3 days but the time is up so I must go at dawn We are sworn brothers so let's not be formal If you insist on going to Meng Zhou instead ofjoining us in the mountains However as life is full of contingencies these few items might prove useful Where have they come from? From a monk; I know not his name or background He has great strength but short temper Xiao Er was a little slow in serving him the wine then he broke the tables and chairs So Xiao Er and Xiao San drugged his wine When we returned, they had already killed him A real shame, as he was a strong guy Only these items are left Look at his blade he must have killed many It rattles at night If you feel unhappy at Meng Zhou you could return here and use these items to dress up as a monk Where can the authorities find you? I'll remember that Please stay, I bid you farewell here Take care A small token to the sheriffs for food and wine along the way Hurry "An Ping Fortress" Faster The convict Wu Sung has been handed over Please wait Take him to the jail first Yes Move Go in I can walk by myself, no need to push You are new here If you got a mercy letter, take it out When the warden comes, you give it to him along with some silver You'll be treated well If not, you'll suffer a beating like me that promises to split your flesh such that you can't get up for 2 to 3 months Thank you all, I have some silver If he asks nicely I'll give him, that's no problem If he uses force, he'll get nothing Be careful The warden is here Which one of you is the new convict? I'm here Wu Sung, you are a man of the world I hear you are a tiger killer and had also been an instructor at Yang Wu County why haven't you sucked up to me yet? While you are here you are unworthy to even beat a cat You want me to suck up to you? No way All you can get from me is my pair of fists Exiled robber I've got money, but that's for my own use to buy wine What can you do to me? You can't extradite me back to Yang Wu County Stop laughing Exiled robber, I must make you pay for it, go He suffered insult from this He would surely try everything to harm your life I'm not afraid, I'll act according to circumstances Convict Wu Sung I won't be able to get away from here Why bother to shout like that? Follow us to meet the prison chief "Gathering Hall" According to the old rules A new prisoner has to be flogged one hundred times Hold him Yes Just go ahead, no need to hold me up If I try to dodge one blow, I'm not a hero If I as much as even holler a little I'm not the killer in Yang Wu County Beat me hard, don't do me favours So bloody stubborn... beat him Yes Wait Wait Wu Sung Did you contract any illness on the way? What illness? I can drink, I can eat, I can beat up bad guys This guy was ill on the way Just put behind this flogging for the time being Hey, tell him that you've been ill The Prison Chief wanted to do you a favour I am not ill, go ahead and flog me If not when am I going to pay back this debt This guy must be sick, he's talking nonsense Lock him up in a single cell Yes No flogging? I still won't give you any money Move, still talking nonsense Let's go Hero, have you had someone you know who'd have asked Prison Chief to take care of you? No Then delaying the flogging is not out of good intention They must come and finish you off at night Why me? He'll give you a good meal first then bring you to the jail Tie you up with ropes and block your seven apertures Hang you upside down then you'll be dead in less than half an hour This is called 'Pen Diao' Anything else? Then they'll nail your hands and feet to the ground and put sand bags on you; Oh man, you'll die a cruel death That's called 'Tu Bu Dai' Anything else? Well, those two are the most terrible, and... Instructor Wu, you are back What do you have to say? Prison chief sends in dim sum Please So quick Will you torture me by Pen Diao or Tu Bu Dai? You are joking Mr Wu, please take a bath Please A bath before death? Alright then Go inside Be especially careful when it's dark Instructor Meal time again? You're right Let go When do you plan to kill me tonight? Please rest assured Nothing happened at night What are you doing? What's inside the basket? Just wine and meat, if you're fed up with that We'll prepare fish for you Strange... do they want to feed me then kill me? You are joking It's by the order of the son of our prison chief Why is he taking such good care of me? I only follow orders and don't know anything else His name's Shi En and is good with fists and the pole he is known as the Golden Eye He likes making friends He must be a hero Take me to him He has not instructed me and I dare not I said go, move I'm just your prisoner and we've no prior acquaintance Thank you for all the food and wine, but I've done nothing to deserve it so it's embarrassing I asked you to treat instructor Wu well and tell him later, why haven't you listened? When he gets angry who could stop him! Your fame precedes you In fact, I have a favour to ask but am embarrassed to do so Just tell me what it is You are a real hero the long journey must have depleted your energy Do rest for a few months we'll talk when your strength returns Last year at the Chai Jin residence I suffered a fever for 3 months but with only a few punches and kicks I killed a tiger at Jing Yang Gang Now you say I have no strength But it can't compare to killing a tiger Harder than killing a tiger? How much energy does it take to hammer down this pole? Three to five hundred pounds of force I guess It requires a lot of strength One person can't do it Well? You are really like a god let's go in and talk In the future if there are any favours that you seek better be straightforward about it Fighting is my game Yes, please Please Out of Meng Zhou there's place called Delightful Forest "Delightful Forest" Merchants from Shantung and Hebei trade there There are about a hundred big inns there and also 20 to 30 gambling houses "Ru Yi Alley" Beautiful ladies from everywhere abound I am quite known in Meng Zhou and everyone pays tribute to me I am not eager about these advantages since everyone respects me Last month unexpectedly, Coach Zheng brought someone from Dong Lu County That man is called Jiang Zhong Not only is he huge but he also has great abilities And hence his nickname Jiang Mun San (God of the Door) He is a real bully He came to grab my territory and he beat me such that I lay in bed for 2 months Now the Delightful Forest is his Everyone is moaning and sighing because of this Odd number Let's see how your luck fares! This is odd number Master Jiang says is odd number, so it must be pay up Yes...odd number...pay... It's obviously an even number Just a small token, please accept it I was afraid you still have to take some rest so I dared not ask Now I see that you are powerful as God That's why I've told you the whole thing How extraordinary is this guy? He's just an ordinary man how different can he be? I thought he was some superman If he is like that, I ought to be scared of him Guess I'm not capable that's why I was beat up by him I'll ask for some good wine to be brought over Let's drink on our way Brother, you... I only beat up unreasonable people Go and see how I'll finish him the way I did with the tiger at Jing Yang Gang If I kill him, I'll take the responsibility - Come, men - Yes Prepare the horses Yes I can walk, what do I need a horse for? But I want you to do one thing for me Please go ahead, your wish is my command On the way I must drink 3 wine bowls at each wine stall What do you mean? Once out of the city, you must buy me three bowls of wine at every wine shop we come across Without three bowls of wine, I won't leave the shop That's what I mean Buddy, it's 15 miles from here to the Delightful Forest Enroute there are 12 to 13 wine shops What happens if you get drunk? Are you afraid I'll get drunk and lose my strength? To me, the more I drink the more powerful I will be when I get drunk Strength comes to me from everywhere There's a wine shop there "Wine" Such a small bowl? Bring me a big one Yes, bring a bigger one Yes This is just the start, let's go Another wine shop Go Here's another one The wine in this shop is good Brother, you're drunk, we'd better go back Here's another one How far is it from here?
