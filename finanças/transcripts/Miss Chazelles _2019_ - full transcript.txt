- Well done. - Thank you. The Miss Chazelles runner-up! Congratulations, Marie. You're so pretty. Thank you. Alright? - Yeah. You? - Chilling. Got a smoke? For Miss Chazelles? Of course! Here. - Thanks. - No worries. - Miss Chazelles' in the house! - Get out. She's in the house! - Got a light? - Yeah. Thanks. You should've won. Of course she should've. Look at that bitch with her crappy crown. Yeah! I bet she sucked off the mayor to win. It was rigged. Goddamn. Look at them. - Fuck her cousins! - Let it go. We can't let it go. They gave us the finger! - Move over. - Alright? - Yeah. How was it? - Great. Yeah, alright. I missed you, you know. You're sick in the head. Cut it out! Check this out. - You posted that? - Show me. Yeah. I put that trash in her place. Show us! - Where's your phone? - Just let me see. Mathias only has porn apps on his phone. You smart ass. - That's hard core. - Come on! Clara is much prettier. I'm just taking her down a peg. Oh shit! Her cousins won't like that one bit. Her cousins can fuck off. Of course, they can fuck off. - Well, let's go? - Yeah, let's drink. Let's do it. Mathias, my phone! - What phone? - Don't try that with me. You're like a kid, give it back! Piss off. - Ready? - Yeah. - Meet at the pitch! - Right, see you! - Wait for us here? - Yeah. - What booze do you want? - I don't know. Hey Clara! Your mates not here? They'll be back. Why? What a clown, with his old flag. We're not looking for trouble, but tell your mates to leave Marie alone. What the fuck, asshole? Don't touch me! Leave her alone! I'll cut you up! Piss off! What you going to do? Clear off. - Take it easy! - Back off! Keep it up, you're going to get it. Shut your mouth. Mathias, stop. - You okay? - I'm fine. Yeah, keep walking, cunts. Did you see me? I was ready to cut the bastard in two! - As if! - They nearly shat their pants. It was two against one, and you didn't do a thing. What are you saying now? Yeah, keep talking. What are you saying? I was behind you, you didn't do a thing. Yeah, keep it up, go on! Let me go! Play gently, children! Hang on! Let me show you something. Think you're so smart... Take that bottle. Throw it, and I'll cut it in two. - You can't do it! - You won't cut it, mate. - If you don't, you're a bitch! - In one go. - Okay! - Go on then! - You're a bitch if you don't. - A bitch if I don't! Fucking useless! They're such idiots. I don't give a shit. Again, come on. Throw it again. Go on. Second try. This time I'll do it. Go on! Hurry up. Quit messing around. Hurry up. I hope tonight goes okay. But why'd you post that today? Seriously? You heard me. You know I can't stand that cunt. Who is it? It's my mom. Where's my daughter? Off doing her make-up, I think. It'd be a shame to start without her. There's my princess. As you know, I'm not good with speeches. Go on! Hurry up! You are so beautiful. I'm proud of you. - We all are. - Yeah! It's quite an achievement to have won. I love you so much. And this is for you. Carve the bark Until you bleed Nail down the doors, Imprison yourself... Let's dance. - To this shit? - Come on, please. Come on! Let's go. Pray to the shadows And walk so far I may tell myself That it takes time I may have written it In black and white Whatever I do Wherever I am Nothing erases you I think of you The days pass Empty furrows Within reason And without love My chance goes by The wind changes Absence remains Stubbornly I may tell myself That's just how it is That without growing old We don't forget Whatever I do Wherever I am... Alright? Alright, yeah. Why didn't you answer my text? I was with Ludo. I'm sorry. Your dad was so cute. What's wrong? It's your friend. She's pissing me off. Yeah, I know. We don't give a fuck about that shit. I think you're beautiful. You'd better, bitch. Fuck! Marie, what are you up to? Shit! Fucking bitch! What'd she do that for? They're going to kill you! I know. Is Ludo a good guy? What about your man? Shut up! What you doing? Seriously, that was in your panties? Gross! Come on! What? No way. Are you crazy? What are you doing? And you! Stay away from my daughter! Where are you going? You fucking slut, we told you to stay away from Marie! I'll bust your face in next time! Girl or not! - Little slut. - Fucking bitch!
