Do you, Hermann Braun, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? I do. The marriage certificate's outside. Do we need it? Of course we need it. Hey. Stay here. Don't run away. Stay here. Help. Let go of me. CIVIL REGISTRY Hermann. - Are you all right? - Come here. Sign it. The stamp. THE MARRIAGE OF MARIA BRAUN a film by Rainer Werner Fassbinder for Peter Zadek Is that you, Maria? I was worried to death. I thought something had happened to you. Nobody wants wedding dresses now: too many brides, not enough men. That's all I got for it. There's so much shaving gear on the market. There, my dear. There. Let's fry some potatoes with bacon. We are interrupting this broadcast of Beethoven's 9th Symphony to bring a search call for missing persons. For each of the names mentioned we have a message. 5,821 Adler first name unknown Born around 1910 paymaster from Vienna. 5,822 Albartz, Eugen born around 1925 non-commissioned officer, married I still feel sick at the sight of some of them. I could do with a tea now. The medical orderlies say crosswise is not the worst. If you get hit all on one side, you can't even hold a crutch. I've seen it going on for six years, and I've been a widow for five. I'd have been satisfied with mine if only he'd come back. How long were you married? I'm still married. I just meant you didn't have much from your marriage. Yes, I did: half a day and a whole night. Mine was killed right at the start, in Norway. He was in the navy until his ship was sunk. Two soups, please. He survived and swam through icy water covered with burning oil. Then he had to fight on land. Then he fell into a crevasse and died. Why didn't you get married again? For condolence, they sent me a painting: a picture of a wreath with a ribbon floating on the waves with "They died, that Germany might live" written on it. Just imagine. "They died, that Germany might live" and he's dead. They send me a picture of the sea, and he falls into a glacier. There were once seas where the mountains are now before the last ice age. How can you be so sure your husband's not dead? Because I want him to come back. - What did he say? - Something indecent. I don't know what you said, but you had no right to. You must be crazy. The divorce is pending. That's why he told me: because he loves me. But her: Since I have her husband now, she said she was going to keep his food ration card. Ration card? - And now? - I don't know. Shame on you. All right, grandpa Berger. Let's try it on. The mistake people make is to love one person all their lives. If we don't have any potatoes, we eat turnips. If we don't have any turnips, we eat gruel. But in love, there's only one man and when he goes to war and is dead five months later you have to mourn for the rest of your life. Does that make sense, grandpa? Much too wide. Yeah, yeah. It's no good being alone. It was almost too tight for Karl the last time he was here, in May '41 . The men still looked like men then. Now they all look as if they've shrunk. You can take the underpants. They're warm. And no one will mind if they're too big. - Let's say, three bundles of firewood? - All right. Look what Maria had. Three weeks of being in love and one day of marriage. Now she stands there with her search board. Do you know why we always stick to one guy? Because there is only one you love. I don't know how Maria knew it at such a tender age. Here she is. Take your things, grandpa. - She has her pride. - How wide? "Pride," I said. There you are, at last. I was just sorting out your father's things. Hello, grandpa Berger. It's nice to have a man in the house to come home to - αnd it's warm too. - Yes, it's warm too. Why are you doing that here? It's my way of remembering your father. Grandpa Berger can use them. Father won't need them anymore αnd we need firewood. I thought the same, but father's belongings? Father's dead and we're alive. What will you give me for them? Your brooch? My brooch? It's very valuable. There's one missing. - OK then. - Oh, Maria. Wait. I'll go and get it. Here. Nazi gang. Snotty-nosed bastards. They're not proper men anymore. What difference does it make whether you're a man or a woman if you're freezing? Something has to change. - What do you want to change? - I don't know but something has to happen. - Do you know Hermann Braun? - No. Don't cry for love alone In this wide world there's more than one There's more than one fish in the sea. I look like a poodle. Do you think so? It's the latest thing. I'll bet... the Americans are just crazy about poodles. My Willi wouldn't have approved. That's for sure. Hermann wouldn't have minded. And they won't hire you anyway. - We'll see about that. - What'll you wear? - What do you do with this? - Play music. Shall I play something for you? Any requests? Yes: the German national anthem. Cut it out. For God's sake, stop it. What use is it, if you can't even play the national anthem? Go on in. Keep your eyes open here. I didn't think you were coming. I waited so long. Hold this a second. Black, size 38, short sleeves low cut. It wasn't easy to come by. Is it for you or is it a present? - It's for business. - We all have to make a living. - And the liquor? - For my mother. It helps her forget her troubles with her daughter and it numbs her heartache. I have a valuable complete edition of Kleist's works from 1907. Would that be something for you? Books burn too easily and they don't warm you. Oh well, if you look at it that way That's the way I look at it. Maybe it's better that way right now. Thanks a lot and good luck. - I'm not going to sew it for you. - You know I can't sew, Mum. My dear girl Mum. Come on. If a girl has pretty legs like you she ought to show them. You father would turn in his grave. I don't think it's right either. I just pray your soul doesn't come to any harm, my girl. Make sure somebody gives you a nice pair of stockings if you're letting yourself in for that sort of thing. Amazing, really amazing. I learned it here on these bars. - Is it a new way to apply for a job? - Not really, but if it were I'd have been hired by now. We don't need anybody. Maybe you won't need anyone apart from me. Come in here. - We still have doors in our place. - Well, we don't. I need your name, address and age. Are you married? Yes. Don't wear your wedding ring to work. And I need a health certificate. Payment in cash or goods? You can get dressed again, Mrs Binder. Is everything OK? Do I get a certificate? No. You'll have to take a break for three or four weeks. Have I caught a dose? A bad dose, I'm afraid. You won't be able to work. That's tough. Come back on Tuesday. 'Bye, Mrs Binder and send the next patient in. Little Maria you used to give me a kiss on the forehead. Did I really? Yes. Then I must have forgotten or learned to forget. That's sad. Yes, it's sad. But tell me about yourself. I need a health certificate. Of course. It's pretty cold this year. I'm working in a bar selling beer, not myself. Even if I've had to learn to stop believing people I still believe you. You know what you're doing. And if anything happens, I'll obtain penicillin for you. I'm not sure how, but I'll find a way. Nothing will happen to me. What's penicillin? Forget it, Maria. How is your mother? The war hasn't made her lose her sense of humour. She shares my rations, cries my tears, tells my lies but she leaves the thinking to me, so that I have no time for dreams. You can have my wife's bicycle if you want. It was as good as new under all the rubble. Thank you. Why don't you ask about Hermann? You don't have to believe he'll come back. It's enough that I know he will. My gloves: They're gone. Hey. You stole my gloves. You rat. You bastard, filthy Nazi. Stop it, you swine, Nazi swine. - I'm going to kill you. - Don't make me laugh. - Nazi swine. - You're a Nazi yourself. WHO KNOWS HERMANN BRAUN? Stop it. - It's quiet tonight. - It's Tuesday. - It's not what you imagined, huh? - I'm satisfied. Then everything's fine. - If you ask me - I didn't ask you. You're here, and your Hermann's not here. He's somewhere else. Maybe he's dead. And love's only a feeling. - It's not the truth. - Sure, love's a feeling and a great love's a great feeling and a great truth. Truth: The truth's what you have in your belly when you're hungry. Feelings are what you have between your legs like an itch when you scratch it. And for this here, you need a full belly and someone who's here not just somewhere or maybe nowhere. Your friend over there, he's here and he's really not starving - and he's sweet on you. - What friend? - Your Bill, darling. - I don't know any Bill. You hadn't even noticed him, huh? - No. Which one is it? - Him over there. He's big and strong. He just happens to be black. Better black than brown. "Braun". He was just a normal guy till you came. Now he's sitting there as if he were paralysed. He wanted to know everything about you. Look: just like Willy Fritsch. - How do I look? - Great. Why? Because right now I want to look great. What are you crying for, you silly cow? Your man's not dead. He's standing there in front of you. Thank your lucky stars you still have him and that the same didn't happen to you. Hermann didn't suffer. It was all over quickly. No one came out, they say. Hi. It's me. Imagine what I have. No, you won't believe it. Willi? You. You're really back. Betty, you have him back. We're so stupid. All we can do is weep for joy that you're together and that Willi's safe and sound. Hermann is dead. My dear. Leave me alone. Where are you going? - To the bar. - Darling, don't. I have to go some place where I can be alone. Beautiful. Please correct me if I say the wrong thing. Thanks. What are you thinking? I was wondering whether it's possible to think about nothing. Can you? I don't think I can. I think I can. Do you reckon I'd have gotten over it as quickly as Maria? I hope you would have, Betty. What's that? Why? It's nice being with you, Bill. I was very happy just now. Only just now? I'm always happy when I'm with you. Me too. Then it's simple: if we're always together, we'll always be happy. - Maybe. - Not maybe: for sure. I have something for you. You shouldn't give me so many presents. It's something special this time. And you must promise me you'll accept it. No, Bill. I can't accept this ring. I'm very fond of you and I want to be with you but I'll never marry you. I'm married to my husband. - Are you sure? - Positive. - How positive? - Maria Please Very well. You'll soon feel it. You'll help deliver it, won't you? Promise me. I can't, Maria. I'm too old to live and too scared to die. It scares me the way you talk. Nonsense. Let's just say I'm quitting here. I'm going to stay with my daughter in the Black Forest. My hands shake too much. Not for me or my little boy. I'll come to you when it's time. Dear little Maria. Yes, I'll come and you'll help me give birth to him. It will be a boy, won't it? - The chances are not bad. - Really? About fifty-fifty. - You don't take me seriously. - Yes, I do. Do you have a father for your boy? Can't you have a baby without one? The father's black, and my son will be called Hermann. - I'm not sick. I'm pregnant. - Pregnant? - You can also say "expectant". - That's nice. I'm expectant. Mum. Grandpa Berger. - Nobody home. - We're alone at last. Are you expectant? Yes. I'm expectant too. I'll speak German with him. - And you? - English. Then he can decide whether to marry a German or an American girl. American girls are ugly. German men are ugly. I know only one American man who's beautiful. I know only one German girl who's beautiful. - And strong. - And rich. And brave. And tender. And tender. Guess who I mean. Me? Hermann? Look, Bill. It's Hermann. Of course. It was off-limits. Germans weren't allowed in except for the hostesses who work there. That would be a fair description of your profession? I was very fond of him. You needn't look it up. You wouldn't understand the difference anyway. I was fond of Bill and I love my husband. You can stop questioning her. It was me who killed that negro. The baby will be ours. We'll explain it all to him later. Later is a long time. What are you going to do till then? I'll wait for you. You're a young and beautiful woman. I'm your wife. And how do you intend to live? I've never learned anything. I must learn to work first. Then I'll get work. We'll begin our life when we're together again. Attention on Platform 1. Freight train passing through. Shall I take it? No. Things are tough enough for you. I know how hard it is for a mother. It was a boy too. The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away. Maybe it has its positive side too. The poor creature wouldn't have had it easy in life. You neither. I never said I wanted to have it easy. All the same... with a black child. Now he's a little black angel. A little black angel. That's nice. Will he always have flowers on his grave? I promise you he will. What are you going to do when you get back to your world? I don't know but I have a lot to do. I must go now. The departure of Train No. 309, the Express to Heidelberg will be delayed by some minutes. TO 1ST CLASS Leni Let me through. Close the doors. The train is about to depart. I have to find my little girl. - There's no girl here. - I beg your pardon? Your Leni, madam. Oh It's a boy, not a girl. You shouldn't have called him Leni, then. How much is the excess charge for first class? - It depends how far you're going. - It depends how far I get with that. - Can I go in now? - Yes, that'll cover it. - I don't travel first class often. - Times are not easy. See him? He's French, but he has his factory here. French? Well, half French. He's quite well off. Hold this a moment. Open the case and turn your back. And now? You can close it again now. I can't read clearly with just one eye. Shall I charge for 23 or 32 km? Have you noticed how tiny the lavatories are? I always thought they'd be bigger in first class because the people are fatter. I didn't have any passengers at first after the currency reform. Now I even get people like you. Now just put the dress back. Don't forget the purse, and then Thanks a lot. I beg your pardon? You speak German? I heard you were French. I imagined you'd speak English. I don't speak French myself. Oh? I don't speak English but I do speak German. What can I do for you? Just answer a simple question. Is this seat free? I believe it is. It looks as if it is. Please sit down. Thank you. I don't like sitting facing the engine. - Haven't we met somewhere before? - I'm sure we haven't. - Sometime? - I'm even more sure now. Are you? - Here are your ticket and your case. - Put the case in the luggage rack. - Have a pleasant trip, madam. - Thank you, conductor. - Dr Karl Oswald - Pleased to meet you. - of Oswald Textiles. - Pleased to meet you. - A cigarette? - No, thanks. I don't smoke. Neither do I. - Do υou like travelling by train too? - Sometimes. It allows you time to think. That's exactly what I've been trying to do the whole time. I don't speak English, I'm afraid. The lady's asleep. Maybe you could Incredible. What did you say to him? I said you were Karl Oswald of textile fame that you like to travel and you want to use the time to think. - Where did you learn your English? - In bed. - May I invite you to the dining car? - That's a very good idea. I have something to discuss with you: a business matter. And after three months, if we find we don't get along I'll be answerable to no one but you? No one. You'll get along fine with Senkenberg and the other men. Are there no women? Not in top positions, not yet anyway. Good. Then I'll be the first. We've managed very well without them up to now. Senkenberg, you're being rude. Forget it. Caution is the better part of valour. - That's right. - Thank you. And what is my exact title? Let's say, "personal adviser". How personal? That depends on the personal adviser's abilities and initiative. - Really? - Really. I told you about our venture with the Americans. Don't forget, it's always a matter of money there. However you meant that, Senkenberg, you're perfectly right. Let him talk. Senkenberg is an affable person, as indeed I am. Well, I'm not. - Hermann will be sad about the baby. - I'm not so sure. Dr Konrad Adenauer adamantly rejected rumours that he was in favour of creating a West German army - You don't have any experience. - She'll learn. Don't move out. Who will take care of you? "We do not wish to take part in a new war," he said. I need my own apartment. I have so much to do before Hermann gets out. "We've had enough dead." I don't understand you. Maria isn't like you. "It must be made clear, once and for all" "that I am against German rearmament" "and the formation of a new German army" Will you be earning enough? And here, an excerpt from Dr Adenauer's speech. "If it is asserted that, under my authority" "the rearmament of Germany will take place" "I can only reply that this assertion is a pure fabrication." I'm sorry, Betty. I guess I've changed a lot. Looking at you, nobody could tell what you've been through. - She didn't mean it that way. - Don't worry. I'll take care of that. - Maybe what Betty says is true. - What? That Oswald's really after Maria. Do you understand now why I have to move out of here? We've only got 75 minutes so let's press on and play as many of the songs you requested as possible. We'll start with the song When the Bells Do Brightly Ring. Were you very sad? Yes, but it was a consolation to know you'd be sad too and that I can tell you everything and that I'm pleased you don't ask me what you don't have to ask and that I'm going to build a house for us as you would have done. There's a Greek word for people who work for you. Translated, it means literally, "male footings". I'm your "male footings". No, that's not true. I'm not your footings. Just say I'm your wife. It was a stupid analogy. You're Maria. You're my wife. - And we're not Greeks. - No, you really couldn't say that. But you have courage. You're beautiful and intelligent and I love you. I may change in the next few years. You've considered everything very carefully. Yes, maybe it's just that. I'll always recognise you. Your time's up. On the contrary my time is just beginning. What did he say? That Pency can supply the plant as a whole, not individual parts. I understood something about handwork. Senkenberg, we have enough problems without you making new ones. I'm just trying to prevent us from having any. I see no serious way of financing more than two of these machines "We're a solid firm, not a bunch of speculators." I know that by heart now but it doesn't solve the problem. - You have to take risks sometimes. - We're not at the races here. I know. But the Americans are getting edgy. We have to tell them something. You're quite right. Well, Senkenberg? For once in your life, stop being Senkenberg. Be Napoleon or Blucher, if you prefer. OK. We can take three SE machines if we mortgage our stocks and get an ERP credit. - And if - "If, if, if". That's our job. We're business people, not bookkeepers. I beg your pardon, but I am a bookkeeper. Sorry. All I meant was that taking a risk What did he say? He summed up our negotiations. Didn't he say he was sleepy? He said he was tired, meaning he's fed up. What do we do? It looks as if we've bitten off more than we can chew. Maybe this deal's a bit too big for us after all. That means dropping nylon and giving German women a woven - May I say something? - Of course. Go and drink a brandy. Give me half an hour alone here. This is no way to do business. That has nothing to do with questions of interpreting. Senkenberg, I beg you. He's right. I don't know a thing about business but I know what German women want and about nylon and woven fabrics and I know a lot about the future. I'm a specialist in that and what harm can it do if the deal's off anyway? You can always say "no" when the time comes. That's the first amusing idea all day. With all respect, Mr Oswald Mrs Braun has absolutely no experience in our field. Then she's about to gain some. Maria Braun, you have rendered outstanding services to the firm. Come on, Senkenberg, you too. I'd prefer to drink to the company in five years' time if it still exists. You're a bore, Senkenberg. You have no sense of adventure. You're the best accountant the most conscientious financial manager but you haven't a mark's worth of imagination - and I mean a Reichsmark. - That's no reproach. In your profession imagination would be detrimental to business. Someone must hold on to the money vouch for finances, secure credit. Where would you and your firm be without Senkenberg? At the races? Well said, eh, Senkenberg? I'd like to drink a toast to Mrs Braun. With her alone we would probably be at the races but without her we'd be in the cemetery. Please excuse me. - It's been a long, hard day, and - And you want to work out how long it will be before we're bankrupt. But seriously, we two survived the war and we three will survive the peace. The firm had to survive without you during the war years, sir. The only contact you had with us was through your bank account. Oh, I don't hold it against you. Political developments have proved you right and made your noble abstinence look like foresight and stature but I'm glad we can count on you again as we did before 1933 and I'm glad to have found in you, Mrs Braun such a good and unorthodox opponent. Good evening. You mustn't be angry with him. I think he really likes you. I'm not angry at all. In a way he's right; not completely but he loves the company heart and soul. I did leave him alone during all those 1,000 years. I dreamed up a cosy world of my own in which I had a comfortable existence. But now... in terms of economic accountability I fully endorse his assessment of the investment. I'm more of a gambler than he is but I must honestly say, we're expecting a miracle. I prefer to make the miracles rather than wait for them to happen. You're a truly exceptional person. - Shall we have another drink? - No, I want to sleep with you. Where's the bathroom? First door on the left. You're wonderful. I'd like you to call me "Mrs Braun" again. If you insist. You know, I was very surprised just now. - Didn't you want to? - Yes. Very much. So did I and I want a clear relationship. Do we have a relationship now? Yes, a clear one. That's the taxi to the station. Senkenberg paid for the others: a taxi back to the apartment and the hotel. That's all. Something will be deducted for breakfast. Come in. - Hello, Mr Oswald. - Hello, Mrs Braun, Mrs Ehmke. - Am I interrupting? - Not at all, sir. Not in the least, Mr Oswald. - I just wanted to - I'm finished anyway. We have to evaluate the conference. I'll be in Mr Senkenberg's office. Mrs Ehmke and Senkenberg: the two conspirators. Tell him I'd like to see him in my office at four, please. You too, Mrs Braun. You too, dear Mrs Braun. At four o'clock, Mr Oswald? I just dropped in to see you... privately. This is not a private place. It's an office in your company. OK. The office is closed over the weekend. Would you spend it with me in the countryside? I'm sorry, but I have to visit someone on Saturday. - You are - I am the way I am. Last night you were a different person. Last night I was Maria Braun, who wanted to sleep with you. Today I'm Maria Braun who wants to work for you. Are you afraid people will think I'm having an affair with you? I don't care what people think. I do care what you think. I don't want you to think you're "having an affair with me" when, in truth, I'm having one with you. But it's also true that I'm fond of you and that you're my boss and I don't want to confuse things, for your sake. I have to know who I'm dealing with: you or my boss. That's a point of view I respect. - Let's talk about my salary. - How much were you thinking of? I need to earn a lot of money in the next few years. Don't we all? But I have a reason. Well? You know now how much my work is worth to you. That's how much I want and not a penny more. Then I'll have to consider how much you're worth to me. Not me: my work. Right. Your work, Mrs Braun. I'm an old man and I'm getting a little slow but I'll do my best. And then Not now, please. Oh, yes. What about Saturday? On Saturday you'll be going to the countryside on your own. Why shouldn't he know I've slept with another man? He hears me when I tell you I love you. That's not the same. Exactly, and because it's not, it won't hurt if he hears it. And because it's not the same, I want you to know. If it were the same, I wouldn't be here. Is he good-looking? He's good-looking, he's courteous and he'd never hurt me. And you should know I wanted to sleep with him. I didn't have to force myself. Because he's my employer and I'm dependent on him I wanted to forestall him to retain my independence. Is that how things are between people outside? - So cold? - I don't know how other people are. It's not a good time for feelings but that suits me. That way, nothing really affects me. I thought you were in the countryside. The flowers have wilted, the chocolates have melted. You have no claim on me. I felt like a schoolboy. That's what you are: a dear, silly little schoolboy. Why didn't you want to come with me to the countryside? Because you'd have proposed to me. Precisely, and that's why How did you know? With schoolboys, you know those sort of things. Sorry. You meant it seriously. I didn't mean to belittle you. I should have told you I'll never marry you but if you want I'll be your mistress. The belligerent tone adopted by your union is repugnant. We can give as good as we take. It's no wonder with your "we're-the-masters-here" attitude. Mr Klenze, the Minister for Trade himself said I know: "We're all in the same boat." But the boat belongs to you, and we have to row it and it seems to irritate you that we want to be paid well to do it. I thought the talks had been adjourned. We can argue next week. Of course though I think some people will never understand. Let's have a drink, Maria. - You know each other personally? - Extremely personally. I didn't notice a thing these last three hours. I'm a master of disguises: a tool of capitalism by day an agent of the working classes at night. The Mata Hari of the economic miracle. Why are your notions of people so much duller than yourself? Let's go, Willi. - Would you say a few words? - Ask Mrs Braun. Does she speak for the management? - Mrs Braun has power of attorney. - OK. Thank you. I haven't much time but I'll drive you home. Shall we have a drink first? Would you care to say a few words? The union's demands, as presented here are little more than blackmail. I'm going to the ladies' room. Would you endorse these tough words? Of course. Are you of a different opinion? I have no opinion. I'm a journalist. You've really made it, my girl. It's strange: us sitting here, tearing each other apart. It's better than that "all-in-the-same-boat" crap. How's Betty? - Why? - Why "why"? Is something wrong? No. It's just that I need someone to talk with and all I have is someone who cooks for me. She does the things she's learned to do. Sure, but she hasn't learned what really counts: how to learn. She's different from you and not as breezy either. I have to be cheerful so that Hermann has something to look forward to something he's proud of. A man can't look forward to or be proud of a wife who's miserable. How nicely you put it. It was nice the way you said, "You've really made it, my girl." I've made it. I like that. It's no use, Dr Klaus. He's so down again today and full of despair. Don't cry, Mrs Braun. I told you before I can help your husband without this visit. Believe me. Money's no object. I have enough, at least. It's not primarily a matter of money. We must proceed with the utmost discretion. The right word to the right person at the right time can work wonders. It will require great tact and delicacy. I know very well you're the only one who can help him. - Oh - It's true. You'll help him and me. I know you will but how long must we wait? That depends entirely on the political situation. Eight days eight years I don't want to know where you were after the meeting but why you won't tell me? Dining with Willi Klenze. - Why didn't you say so? - Because it's a lie. I detest you. I like you. Why don't you love me? - Because you lie to me. - I wasn't lying. You're driving me out of my mind. I repeat, I don't want to know where you're going tomorrow - Good. Thanks. - Let me finish. - Why? - What do you mean, "why"? Why don't you want to know where I'm going tomorrow? You're not interested in me. I detest you. I love you. Why don't you love me? I thought we wanted to eat first. The mark of a good businessman is that he can quickly change his plans. - Did you want to see me? - Why? Can't I? Don't be silly. But why didn't you phone? Because I want to see you, feel your presence. You're crying. Maria, what's the matter? I'm crying. What do you know, I'm crying. I don't know why. - Now you're crying. - I'm not crying at all. I never cry. Come with me. - Where? - You'll see. My name's Karl Oswald. Hermann Braun. I'm a friend of your wife's. I know. What do you want? I wanted to meet the man she loves. Do you remember? Why don't they fix this place up? They wanted to do more for the children. Don't cry for love alone In this wide world there's more than one There's more than one fish in the sea. I'll love each one who pleases me. Did I understand you correctly? You want me to write it like that? Yes. You can't be serious. I am, Senkenberg. Would you joke about such matters? You're crazy, both of you. No. We're very much in our right minds, both of us. I have only two or three years left, and you know it. I want to use that time to live. The idea can only come from a sick mind. Your brain's in worse shape than your liver. I'm sure you're right, Senkenberg but I have life adventure the key to the universe. Uh-huh, and a dose of madness. No. But maybe I live in a country of that name. Madness. Well? Anything wrong? You didn't come yesterday. No, no. Everything's fine. Do you have a hangover? A bit. It's nothing serious. Don't forget, it's my mother's birthday today. Oh, yes. Should I pick you up? No. Happy birthday, mum. The things that go in a basket like that. - Shall I dye your hair for you? - No. You work so hard as it is, dear. Go into the kitchen and make some coffee. This is Mr Wetzel, a friend of mine a very good friend. So good, you can call me Hans. Hello, Mr Hans. Grandpa Berger. How are you? - Did you have to come out now? - I must go to the bathroom. - Now of all times? - You can't deny the call of nature. Go on, then. - My name's Maria. - Hi, Maria. - Maria Braun. - Glad to meet you, Mrs Braun. You crafty old son of a bitch. Well, how was I? Sweet. I can never decide what to choose: something sweet or Now one with the whole family. Let me take it, mum. Oh, no you don't. The whole family must be in it. Mr Oswald, if you would be so kind? Why not? But Maria knows how hopeless I am with technical things. Any fool can take photos with a camera like that. If that's the case nothing can go wrong. Grandpa has to be in it too. Set the focus at 12 feet. The aperture's OK. And keep still or we won't be in focus. We're not very sharply focused anyway. Ready. - Shouldn't we wake Grandpa up? - No, it's more natural that way. - He's always sleeping. - And never sins. At least he kept me warm in those cold times after the war. - Oh, yes? - Yes. He supplied me with firewood. He didn't even wake up when Goebbels spoke. Don't hear much of him these days. Life has its own rules. Somehow it never occurred to me that my mother's a woman too. Then someone comes along and suddenly she is one. I still don't think it's right at her age. It's indecent. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but that's how I feel. When you're unhappy, happy people all seem a bit indecent. When Willi and I are alone at times I feel as if we were already dead. It's always the same old thing, basically. What do I mean, "dead"? He's bored to tears with me. That's the worst thing. - Then do something about it. - What should I do? I'm no good at anything except putting on weight. We all put on weight. - Soon I won't even find a lover. - The lovers are getting fatter too. - Does Oswald know about Hermann? - No. It wasn't important at first. Then it was too late to tell him. Tell him now. He'd kill himself. You look sad. I am sad. Let's dance until we drop. Until we drop. - Tell me what's wrong. - I'll love you forever. As long as I live. What's all this? I want you to have everything, to feel independent. It's your money and your life, Maria. I live my life and won't let anyone give me a different one. But it's your money. I've led this life for you, for us. Take me back, please. It's for you, Mrs Braun. Dr Klaus. When? On the 23rd? That's next week. So suddenly? I Excuse me, I I have to I'm completely confused. I have to sort out so many things so many things things - Hello, Mrs Braun. - Hello. I've come to pick him up for good. I won't be coming anymore. You're too late, I'm afraid. Your husband's gone. He left this letter for you. - Who? - Your husband. My husband? He left over an hour ago in a taxi. Maria, I'm going away to Australia or Canada. We'll live together when I've become a human being. We'll have to wait that long. A rose every month will remind you of me. Hermann. Oswald. Is Maria there? Yes, of course. I just thought - Thank God. - I beg your pardon? I just thought - Yes? - I don't know. - Why are you here? - I'm working. - So late? - Why not? At night I have my peace. I'm nearly finished. Then you can take me home, please. Please. - Downstairs on the left. - OK. No one in our family ever had their own house before. You're the first one, my dear. Somebody had to be first. If your father had lived, he'd have built us a house. But he's not alive, is he? My dear girl, how can you say such a thing? Well, it's the truth. - You used not to be so sentimental. - That's not the point. You've changed so much, Maria. You're like a stranger. - And I'm cold, aren't I? - So? - That's nothing unusual these days. - Why doesn't she say so then? You can put the crate in there. I said put it down, not throw it. But they're solid crates. - Don't interfere. - That's no way to treat people. Nonsense. He's paid to do his work. I've a right to demand he does it properly. That's right. You, who never did an honest day's work. - I guess that's it. - Fine. What's he waiting around for? For a tip, I guess. A tip. If that's the custom, why don't you say so? Ask for what you're entitled to. Is that enough? Give him another one. So now I don't have to say thanks. I'd rather pay than say thanks. What's this? There's a pair missing. There were four of them. She gave me a pair. - Why doesn't she tell me? - He hasn't worn them yet. You thought Hermann wouldn't need them. He won't be coming back anyway, you thought. I can really use them. That's not the point. I don't like her lying to me. At least I live as well as I can. You don't live at all. I beg your pardon? I think she wants you to ask her to move in. You know I have this house so that I can be alone. You know exactly what I want. Yes: to live as though you were in a jail. That's not bad, from someone like you. I have to pay for my sins. - Or... was it your idea? - Mine? No, of course not. You and your roses, your power of attorney and your money. One rose a month: that's all she hears from him. It's like dying once a month. Am I right? We should also like to express our surprise that you are interpreting the quality standards contrary to the terms of the contract. We hope you will reconsider your position without delay and amend it to comply with the agreement. Failing this, we see ourselves obliged etc., etc. to place the matter in the hands of our legal department. Mrs Ehmke, don't drive me crazy. We've written this sentence a hundred times. If I don't dictate it, you don't have to repeat it. But I always You've completed that stupid sentence 99 times. That's at least 98 times too often. I've had enough of it. I'm sorry. That's all right. We all lose our temper sometimes. It's no wonder with you, the work you do. How about a coffee and a brandy? You don't look at all well. Don't interfere in my personal affairs. The way I look is my business. Answer the phone. But I'm not here. Mrs Braun's office. Hello, Mr Oswald. - He wants to speak with you. - I said I'm not here. Sorry, Mr Oswald. She's out of the office. I don't want to have lunch with him either. And she doesn't want to have lunch with you either. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. Hello? Mr Oswald? What a laugh. That was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. Stop crying, now. Call him back and tell him Maria Braun is possessed by the devil and if he wants to have lunch with the devil he can meet me in the Bastei at one o'clock. Mr Oswald you're late. I'm sorry. I was almost afraid to breathe anymore. I had to remind myself that I enjoy life. Life's like that. It's as if we had a contract to enjoy life. When we dine well, we discuss how good the food is. - You're cynical. - Maybe I am cynical. You're bored with me. Maybe I am bored with you. Why do we keep sitting here? Because you're well brought up, and I pretend to be and there's something between us for which I can't find the words and I also like living the way we live and anyway, I have no choice. It may not sound like much, but it is, because it's reality. The things I imagine I don't have nobody does, not even you. We can't exist without each other. - Do you want to leave me? - Why should I? We'd be even unhappier then. That would be stupid. Only if you've known unhappiness do you still have hope. I'm not bored with you. There. The problem is, she believes we broke up because she was getting fat. - She still thinks so. - But it's not true. In fact, she was losing weight. Don't talk like that. After all, Betty was your wife. And she's my friend the only person I can tell all my troubles to because she doesn't listen. Perhaps. Just as you need someone who listens to you maybe I need someone who doesn't listen to me. And her boutique is quite a success. Her boutique! What a laugh. It's your boutique. Without you she'd be sitting on her fat arse Then it's true? You haven't gotten over her. Otherwise you wouldn't pull her to pieces. It wouldn't matter to you. This used to be our classroom. Betty sat next to me and used to copy from me. And Anneliese? - What's she like? - What she's like? Hard to say. She's the type of woman a man needs, his own equal. She can talk, think. She's my equal in every way. - So women have to be men's equals? - Sure. Except that most men don't have the awareness. Human consciousness lags behind the real developments. - Did Anneliese say that? - Why? One day, you'll wish you had your fat little Betty back. Or do you already, at night in your dreams? Nonsense. How can you say that, of all people? Because with me it's the opposite. Reality lags behind my consciousness. Sleep, my child, sleep. Your father was a sheep. From Pomerania your mother came. Pomerania's gone up in flames. Sleep, my child, sleep. Your father was a sheep. From Pomerania your mother came. Pomerania's gone up in flames. Maria Braun, take care you don't become peculiar. Mr Oswald? This is Maria Braun. I need someone who'd like to sleep with me. Hello. Mrs Braun What's wrong, Senkenberg? Why are you staring like that? Mr Oswald is dead. His housekeeper found him: heart failure. He died in his sleep peacefully. She said he had a smile on his face like a baby. In the words of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer "If there were an end, my friends "we have the right to arm ourselves7 "as much as we can, as much as we wish." And now to sport. Less than 24 hours remain before the start of the World Cup football final in Wankdorf Stadium in Berne between Germany and Hungary. The Hungarians are still clear favourites. That is the end of the news. Bavarian Broadcasting. It is 11:00pm. - Are you hungry? - Yes. You're mean. How can you think of food at a time like this? Maybe you'd like to take a bath? I'll run it for you. - Hot or not so hot? - Medium. I'll do it. I'll be right back. Here, catch. Don't look at me like that until I'm finished. You have a beautiful wife, you know. The opener's in the kitchen. Oh, you don't know where the kitchen is. Here. You can put these on after your bath. There's a pair missing. Hans has them. Don't you want to know who Hans is? No. I won't tell you, then. - Are the women in Canada beautiful? - Yeah. - As beautiful as me? - Yeah. - You're lying. - Naturally. Why did you get dressed? Yes, I did, didn't I? I have to get to know you first, Mr Braun. And when you remind me of someone I love very much I won't need a dress anymore. We haven't even kissed each other. Patience, Hermann. We were married only two days and our days are long. Are you afraid? - Yes. - So am I. Let's go on a trip somewhere in the countryside. A honeymoon to get to know the things I love. Why don't we go? Because I can't just get up and leave everything. I have a very definite agreement to keep. I have to hand things over. I need a few days for that. Short days, Hermann, not the long ones. Maybe I should take a bath after all. Maybe you should kiss your wife first. Let me finish this first. Tell me about things. I did it for us, for you, because I love you and I can love you only as your husband not as someone you have to give life back to. I haven't given you your life back. It was a chequebook. It was evidently a chequebook. I wanted to be somebody for you, so that you could love me. Understand? No, but I do love you. It's a goal. Goal. Goal. Goal. I want to be your wife. I've been thinking. We'll draw up a contract, saying everything I have belongs to you. - Including your heart? - That has always been yours. Or it belongs entirely to me, which is maybe the same thing. I'm serious about the contract. Dismissed. I want a different contract in which I give you everything I possess. Do υou mean it? I mean it. It meant so much to you. But now I have it. Fine. But I'm a rich woman. I shall certainly inherit a fortune. Anyone can inherit things. Anyone? Maybe. Why do you want to give me everything? Because I'll become your husband today and won't need anything anymore. - Who can that be? - What's the time? - A quarter past six. - What day is it? The 4th. It's Senkenberg with a lady from Lyon. Oswald deposited his will in Lyon. Strange. I almost forgot the appointment. - Excuse me, I thought we... - Senkenberg. We had agreed - that man is a complex being. - Yes. - May I introduce Mademoiselle Delvaux? - Hello. Hello. Please go in while I put something on and please begin. - But - Senkenberg, no "ifs" and no "buts" and certainly no "maybes". - I'm sorry, mademoiselle, but we - No "buts", remember? I'm Hermann Braun. In respect of the main provision: the right of ownership and use of all movable and immovable company assets with the exception of the above limitations and of my entire personal estate with the exception of the above limitations shall pass in one moiety to Maria Braun who gave me more joy than any other person in the world. The remaining moiety shall pass, in accordance with the contract concluded at Kreuzhof Jail on June 14, 1951 to Hermann Braun who was my friend although he loved the same woman as I did. He respected a love that was not his own... You knew about the contract. Mr Oswald was very ill. and sacrificed more than may humanly be expected. Only those capable of great love are capable of respecting the great love of others. Only those who can serve may rule. I have a headache. Hermann Braun has earned the right to power as few others have. They've finished reading the will. Senkenberg and Mademoiselle Delvaux want to go. Ask them to excuse me, please. - Aren't you feeling well? - Just a headache. Don't forget. I've given you everything: all the money. - It doesn't interest me. - I've given you everything too: my whole life. Do you have a light? No. THE MARRIAGE OF MARIA BRAUN Mrs Braun. Maria It's all over. Germany is world champion having beaten Hungary 3-2 in the final in Berne. After these 30 seconds you must excuse the reporters. We shall now try to describe the further course of events.
