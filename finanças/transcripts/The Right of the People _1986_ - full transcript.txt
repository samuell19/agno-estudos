I'm not gonna deny that poverty can Sometimes be factor in criminal behavior. But can you deny that we live in a society in which the majority support the law and expect violators to be prosecuted According to punishment set forth on those laws. Maybe the law is out of touch, maybe justice really is blind. I don't think so. You were at Berkeley in the '60s, weren't you Mr. Booth? Mmm-hmm. That's right.. You've come a long way. You mean, because I've stopped believing that all the innocent people are in jail? You're the da, you ought to know. Well, isn't it possible that somebody could end up a criminal, Maybe because we've denied him the right or the opportunity to become something else. Except, how do we explain that to the raped and the robbed, to the survivors of the dead? How do we tell them to turn the other cheek? So, how do I look? Like a bride. I love it when you lie. Hey, that's what friends are for. Why don't you move back? - And leave the paper? - Yeah. I got a better idea. Why didn't you and Chris move to Washington? - We've been talking about it. - Have you really? -Can't be now though. But, maybe, someday... -Soon? I don't know. We'll see. Oh! That would be great. I'm ready. Oh, Katie, that's an awfully pretty dress you wearing. -Thanks. My mum bought it for me. -Hey, what about your dad? He paid for it. Come on, mommy, we don't wanna keep daddy waiting. She's like this at six. Heaven help us when she's seven. - Hey, you're doing great. - Oh... - I'm gonna miss you. - Me, too. Why don't you break down and make it permanent, Chris? I don't have the time, Jay. The kids are crazy about you, you know that? Got a case load that could choke a rhino it's hard enough trying to get away with one night. Come on, Chris! What are your priorities? What's more important in the long run, prosecuting felons or inspiring a lot of good, young law students? Well, I guess that depends, Jay. Which would you rather have, more bad guys or more lawyers? - Have some time to think about it. - See you next week. Hi. Oh!. I thought you were meeting Angela and Katie at 7:00 for dinner. I'm late. What are you still doing here? It's Friday night. Oh! I changed my bath night to Saturday. - Is there something I can help you with? - Is this still alphabetical? Yeah, but I was thinking about changing it. You know, to the Dewey decimal system. - So, what's homework for tonight? - The Bowen case. Ah, something new? Yeah. I'm not convinced we got a guilty defendant. - Thanks. - Everybody in this city thinks he's guilty, Chris. Yeah. Well... I'm prosecuting this case. Not public opinion. - Okay. - Go home. Thanks. - You have a good weekend. - You, too. First one to move gets his head blown off. Shut your face, lady. Shut your fat face. Okay, purses and wallets on the table. Cash out! Jewelry out! You got it? Then do it, now! Go, go, go... Mommy. No! We found nothing. Uh, find out and let... - Chris. - Mike. God awful mess. Did somebody call you in or what? - Angela and Katie. - What about 'em? I was meeting 'em here. Count your blessings. 20 minutes ago, they would have been right in the middle of all this. They might have been here 20 minutes ago. What? We were supposed to meet here for dinner at 7:00. Well, maybe, probably they're outside talking to greeny or shay. I didn't look. Well, then why don't we just go out and do that, then? Let's go out and find them, all right? - Angela! - Chris. Angela! Chris. Chris. No! Katie! No! - Katie! - Come on, come on. She's the one, if she hadn't started anything none of this would have happened. What did you do? Get off me, what did I do? - I'm gonna kill you! - Get off me, you fool! I'm gonna kill you! - Chris. - Get away. God! God! - I'm gonna kill you. - Come on. I will kill you! Get out! Let me go! I'm gonna... No! Flying high. High, high, high. Higher, higher. Oh, god! I've been looking for you for two hours. -I came over twice. I called -i shut the phone off. Oh, Chris! - I'm so sorry. - Come inside. It's cold out. Oh, I have to call my father. He is so worried. Everybody is so worried. Unplug the phone when you are done. Hi, daddy. Yeah, he's here. The funeral will be on Sunday at 10:00 At Glen Rose. I spoke to the principal of Angela's school about the... Glee club there. Friends are flying in tomorrow. I'm not staying here tonight. But where will you go? Aren't you're supposed to go back to Washington tomorrow? Oh! It doesn't matter. I'll stay as long as you need me. No. You should get the flight back Sunday afternoon. I'll... I'll drive you to the airport. I think maybe, I should just stay a little while longer. Maybe, another week. They're gone, Alicia. A week isn't going to change that. Let's let that be my decision, okay? - Where are you going? - I told Mike trainor I'd meet him at 11:00. - Chris, what can you do there? - What can I do here? We found the car. We've got the weapons. We've got their height and weight. Nothing else? They wore masks, Chris, uh... But we outta be able to pull some prints from the car. What's the count? Eight dead, seven hospitalized, Three in ICU, and in that I only got too much hope for two of them. Why don't you go see the doc? Have him give you something to relax, get some sleep. Don't worry about me. All right, um... We're going under the assumption that they haven't gotten out. I've spoken to the chief, and, uh, We'll have the state police with us and two more choppers. If it comes down to it, we'll go house to house. If they're in, they stay... It is Sunday morning in America, a day of rest, of church services, of picnics in the park. But here in St. Lawrence, it's a day of darkness, and grief and mourning. It has been just 36 hours, since two armed men became messengers of violent death for ten people. Including one family of four, and a little girl of six. It was a senseless massacre, unprovoked, ugly as hell itself. Police investigators have formally identified the two gunmen as, Ralph Charles Hubert and Anthony Lee styles. Ages 26 and 28. Convicted felons who were released from penitentiaries less than six months ago. At this hour, both men are still free. Clergymen in St. Lawrence will address their congregations today. They will call for prayers for the souls of the departed. And they will ask forgiveness for their killers. May god give me the strength to be that generous. ♪ I am sailing ♪ I am sailing ♪ home again ♪ 'cross the sea ♪ I am sailing ♪ stormy waters ♪ to be near you ♪ to be free ♪ I am flying ♪ I am flying ♪ like a bird ♪ 'cross the sky ♪ I am flying ♪ passing high clouds ♪ to be near you ♪ to be free ♪ can you hear me ♪ thro' the dark night ♪ far away ♪ I am trying ♪ forever dying ♪ to be near you ♪ to be free ♪ - Good morning, Chris. - Rosalind, get trainor for me. All right. Mike, it's Chris booth. Okay, I'll get it in my office. - He'll be right back. - Thanks. Hi, how you doing? I'm okay, what you got? They were seen in Wichita last night. Solid ID's, knocked over a liquor store. Anybody hurt? No, but they're on it real hard back there. Okay. You won't forget about dinner tonight, will you? 8:00. Okay, 8:00. Did Katie go to heaven? Yes. Katie did go to heaven and... And so did her mom. Are they angels now? I hope so. - Chris. - Good morning, counsel. -How are you, Chris? -I'm alright, Marjorie. I'll be fine. - First day back? - Second. I was at a dinner last night with Alicia frost's father. He's having a rough time himself. Alicia and my wife were friends since they were kids. Yes, he said that. He said he must have A thousand snapshots in the house, albums full. Angela and Alicia six, seven years old, Ten, high school graduation, college... I never knew you were all so close. I'm glad you're back, Chris. If there's anything, anything I could do? Thank you, thank you. Can we have lunch next week? I'll have Patti call ros and check your calendar, okay? Good morning, Mr. Mayor I didn't think you'd mind my waiting in your office. The people are angry, Chris. The whole city is mad as hell. And the worst part of this is they've got no place to put it, no way to vent it. What I'm going to do, I'm going to call an old fashioned town meeting. I'm gonna give the people a chance to talk. See, it's all tied up inside, all the grief, all the anger, all the fear, it's tied up inside of you, too. I can see that. I can feel it. But we've gotta let it go, Chris. All of us. 'Cause if we don't, it's gonna tear us up. I wanted to tell it to you first. I'm counting on you being there. Tomorrow afternoon, council chambers, 2:00, an open forum. Anyone that wants to speak gets a chance. The Greeks called it catharsis. It's a good word. Bring it up, take a good look at it, yell at it, cry over if you need to. And then let it go. Let it go, Chris. How do you punish a man who is a product of his environment? Who's never had a chance, who's been beaten over the head so many times, That he's lost the feeling of pain, his or anyone else's. - Does he know right from wrong? - Meaningless. - To who? - To him and to us. Right and wrong doesn't matter to this guy. He doesn't care anymore because he's forgotten how to care. What you gonna do if this guy comes up to you on the street, and kicks you right where it hurts? Mmm? What are you gonna do? Ignore it? Or maybe you'll apologize, you to him. Because you're not feeling his pain because you got some breaks and he didn't. 'Cause you're young and he's old. Because you're white and he's black. What are you gonna do? That? Or are you just gonna just haul off and kick him back? Waste the fool. Answer the question. What are you gonna do? I don't know. You don't know? It's never happened to me before. Stand up. - What? - Stand up. Get up. - Why? - Just get up! No way. Well, congratulations. You just set a new world's record from liberal to conservative in just 45 seconds. How does it feel? You took a chance. - I'm might have hit you. - No. - You would have hit back. - Am I supposed to feel proud? Humbled. You just found out you're not as good as god. Daddy. Katie! If the, uh... district attorney would care to speak, we encourage him to do so. Yes. You go, Chris. There were 360 people murdered in America. - Louder. - We can't hear you. There were 360 people Murdered in America last week. 1600 women were raped. There was a burglary every 11 seconds. I don't think I can take that... Anymore. My wife... Angela and my daughter Katie are dead. They never had a chance. I don't wanna be the next victim. I don't care why somebody wants to shoot me or steal from me or rape the wife of my friend, because from this moment on if anybody tries, I'm gonna be ready to fight back with this! Until someone can prove otherwise, I am gonna maintain that this society isn't mature enough, isn't godly enough to walk our streets unarmed. And as long as there are a million savages out there with murder in their eyes, I'll be damned if I'm gonna be open season. If it's war, let's call it war, and prepare for war. If it is peace, prove it to me, and I'll disarm. But don't ask me to join hands and sing songs of brotherly love When my family is being shot down like dogs! I am tired of being told that fighting back is crude. Tell it to the man who points the gun. Not to those of us who'll only defend what's ours. When he throws down his gun, I'll throw down mine. But until he does, don't ask me to sacrifice my life because somebody out there, doesn't care if I live or die Now this issue... Can be put to a vote, a "yes" or a "no" ballot. should any citizen of St. Lawrence, who's over the age of 18 and free of any criminal record be allowed to carry a handgun, openly or concealed, anywhere within the boundaries of this city? Now this isn't... This isn't a mandate for lawlessness. But a long... Overdue recognition of the facts of life. Yeah! Yeah! I might die for my family. I might... Die for my country. I might die for a principle. But in no damn way, am I gonna die without a fight. I'm going to fight you all the way on this, Chris. We're all gonna fight him. Really? It didn't sound like Chris had too many enemies over there, 30 minutes ago. What you heard, Marjorie, was the sound of a decade of anger suddenly finding a release. Young Mr. Booth here held up a great big punching bag. And they'd beat the devil out of it. Maybe, out of it themselves at the same time. What do you think, Chris? I think we'll have to carry it through to the end. What end? What are you talking about? Is this some kind of political stunt pull? Is that what this is really all about? Now, calm down, Edward. There's no need to raise your voice in here. I don't know, Larry. Those people look crazy. They're just crazy! It scared the devil outta me, if you wanna know the truth. Well, it's a scary proposition all around, won't you say, Chris? Do you have a carry permit for that gun? Oh, for god's sake, ev! I'm still the chief of police in this city! And I have every right to ask the man. Da or not, he's a private citizen. And unless this law has already been passed, carrying a gun in this city without a permit is still a crime. Yes, I have a permit. Well, I'm gonna fight you all the way on this, Chris. Right down the line. That's your privilege, Mr. Mayor. More than that, sir, it's my responsibility. This is wrong, Chris. This is so wrong! You tell that to Angela and Katie. Oh, for pity's sake! Since when does one wrong justify another? What happened to the golden rule? If you're gonna campaign for law and order, put the order in the hands of the law, where it belongs. The law isn't working, chief. The law is working! The law has not failed! Well, look... I don't know how anyone else feels. But personally... I don't think it would ever have gone this far, that Chris would ever have made such a radical stance if his own wife and daughter hadn't been killed. Now, am I right or wrong? Thanks for meeting with us, Chris. We all have some thinking to do, wouldn't you say? Suppose we call it proposition g? For guns. Come with a... a catchphrase. You know, um... A call to arms, kind of slogan. One small step for man, that kinda thing. You got a lot of heat right now, Chris. If you want us to handle this, I could guarantee a commitment. A million dollars in two weeks. Who from? You know... This isn't a political campaign. You're not gonna owe anybody any favors. I'm gonna tell you something, buddy. I believe in what you're doing. I'm on your side, Chris. All the way. - Got a call from Lipton this afternoon. - Senator Lipton? Wanted to tell me how sorry he was about Angela and Katie. What a terrible tragedy it must have been for me. What did he really want? "Civilization's come a long way," he said. But this issue I’m... Promoting is actually gonna be a law. He says back 200 years, and we were likely to have a rebellion on our hands. What'd you tell him? I said, "senator... "The rebellion now and then is a good thing." You said that? - I was only quoting. - Quoting who? Thomas Jefferson. Hi. My plane got in half an hour ago. I haven't even been home yet. I don't understand. The security is really bad in this hotel, Chris. All it took was $10 to one of the housekeepers and she let me in. What are you doing here, Alicia? I felt, I had to talk to you face to face. About what? I need to know if you intend to really go through with this. Because if you do, I'm gonna try to talk you out of it. And if I can't, I'm gonna fight you. This your father's idea? - I heard about it through him. - Your newspaper? They're paying my expenses. This is not their problem Alicia, or yours. This hasn't been your home for five years. Whether this is my home or not doesn't matter. And you're wrong about it not being their problem. If proposition g passes, Chris, it'll be national news. It could have an effect on everybody in this country. You want something to drink? Huh? - Beer, soda? - No. Thanks. How long you planning on staying? That's up to you, I guess. This isn't any good, Alicia. We've known each other too long. This is no good. Angela was my best friend, Chris. Since we were seven years old. And I loved Katie the way I would've loved my own daughter. But there's nothing we can do to bring them back. Did you take a taxi? - Yes. - Good. Lets go, I'll drop you to your father's, let's go. I want you to do both of us a favor. I want you to have breakfast with your father Then take the next flight back to Washington. - I can't do that. - I'll buy you the ticket. - We are in a fight for people's lives, Chris. - We? Who invited you? What do you think you're fighting against? The right of the people to defend themselves? No, an insane idea that if you let everyone carry a gun you're gonna reduce violence. I'm tired, Alicia. I am tired of listening to empty speeches from empty headed flower children About loving my fellow man, when my fellow man has a .38 aimed at my guts. Is that what I am to you? An empty headed flower child? - I wasn't talking about you. - No, but you are not talking to me, either. Should I be? Is this an interview? - You're not being fair, Chris. - Are you? You're here, as a reporter. You're here to be impartial, objective. To look at the issue from all sides, not just the one that you happen to support. - Is that what you're doing? - What I'm doing has nothing to do with you. Which means what? That you don't have to be objective? I'm living it, Alicia, not reporting it. I have a right to be here, Chris. This country was born out of revolution. But it is dying out of... Indifference. All I'm trying to do is keep from getting infected. Go back to Washington, Alicia. Go back to your newspaper. Tell them it was a mistake. Tell them that what happens here in st Lawrence, is not gonna be a shot heard round the world, because guns don't start revolutions, Alicia, they end them. Goodbye. Who are you? What do you want? You look awful. Do you think it might have been a cop? Maybe. They're running scared, Chris. I'm scared. What's a cops supposed to do if this law of yours gets voted in and half the people in the city start walking around with guns in their hands? How many times are they gonna be able to duck when every other Fender-bender turns into a shootout? It's gonna be civil war, man. And the way some of these guys are looking at it... I'm gonna be honest with you, you're the one who's taken us right to the edge. This doesn't have to come to that anymore. - Why? - I just got off the phone with the sheriff in Wichita. They picked up styles last night. - What about Hubert? - Hubert's dead. They tried knocking over another coffee shop, didn't work. Styles isn't fighting extradition, we'll have him back here by 6:00 tonight. So it's all over now, Chris. You can let it go, all of it. Got any smokes? You're the public defender? You murdered... My wife... And my daughter. Is that a fact? And eight other people. If you say so. It doesn't matter to you? I didn't know 'em, did I? What if it had been your wife? Or your little girl? Not mine, man. I'm free as a bird I'm asking you... What if? Well... Then I'd probably do... What you're only thinking of doing. Only you don't got the guts. Look, I've been up for three days, Jack. So unless you got something important to say... Why don't you just broom off? Tell them they can wake me for supper, but real gentle, okay? Chris. What happened? It's gonna make you wonder how many more like styles are out there. He's a three-time loser, he's hardcore. They're not all like that. Yeah, I know... Just the killers. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna finish what I started. Don't do it, Chris. I'm asking you as a friend. Give my love to Dianne and the kids, will you? - Chris... - Oh! Good morning, Jay. Well, how's it going? I mean the campaign. Well, we're gearing up. Need any help? What did you think, you were alone out there? I hadn't started counting yet. Well, take my word for it, Chris. You got a lot of support... A lot. And I'm one of them. So if you need any help, my friend, just give me a call, will you? - Morning. - Good morning. Did Phil Petroni call? -Yes -and? - The screenings schedule for this afternoon, at 2:00. - Good. - Rosalind. - Yes? We haven't had time to speak these last few weeks. No, we haven't. We can take a few minutes now. When you first spoke out, you know, it was from anger and pain. And I understood that. But I thought it would fade away. It's never gonna fade away. I'm sorry. And not just for you, Chris, but for all of us if prop g passes. If you just joined us, my guest this morning is Alicia frost. The subject, as it has been every morning this week, proposition g. Alicia is a native of St. Lawrence, but for the last several years has been living and working in Washington, D.C., Where she writes a nationally syndicated column. When you and I were speaking before the show, you gave me some statistics. Umm... yes. As we know, Liz, proposition g would allow any one over the age of 18, who is free of a criminal record or any history of a mental disorder, to legally carry a gun in St. Lawrence. Now according to some of the information I've gathered, that means that over 75,000 people in this city would qualify. Now, of that number, do you have any information about all those who own guns that are legally licensed? Regardless of what that number might be, they are not currently allowed by law to carry their guns on the street. What I want you to try to imagine Is what it would be like in the city if preposition g passes. And let's say... let's say only 10% of those people actually begin To take their guns out of their homes. That will be 7500 people. 7,500 citizens carrying guns to work, to the market, to school and let's say it's more than that. Let's say it's 20%. That's 15,000 men and women armed and dangerous Walking the streets of St. Lawrence. But you say armed and dangerous, do they necessarily go hand in hand? There were over 1,900 accidental shooting deaths in this country last year, Liz. But according to the second amendment of the constitution, the public has the right to keep and bear arms, now isn't that true? It's a matter of interpretation. The amendment refers to a militia, to an army. Not necessarily to the individual. Then, it is open to debate. And it has been debated for nearly 200 years. I wonder if it's possible, Alicia, that the debate will end right here, in Saint Lawrence when the people go to the polls next month. I need your help, lieutenant. I need it bad. Your friend booth is killing me. Sit down, sit down. I know the two of you are close. Families were close. Must been a rough on all of you. But then, look, Mike, Chris booth is the first man with the short haircut, a suite and a tie, who told people it's all right to fight back. - It's all right to shoot. - I don't know what more I can do, sir. I've talked to him, I've just about pleaded with him. Somebody tried to kill the man for god's sake! Didn't that mean anything to him? I don't think it was an attempt on his life. I think somebody was just trying to get a message across. And what kind of feedback are you getting from the department? Mixed. You're telling me he's getting support from the force? Nobody knows better than the cop what it's getting to be like out there. And I don't know one cop, myself included... Who'll leave his own house without his gun. Would you? This one doesn't have your name on it, let's keep it that way. Vote yes on g. Well, what'd you think? Let's run it. Great. And whose law was it? And whose law was it? In the first place, that ordered us, not to carry guns. - Was it yours? - No. - How about you? Was it yours? - No way! - Was it? - No way. Then whose law was it? Who voted for it? And when? I wasn't there... - Were you? - No! Was it 50 years ago? Was it 70? - No! - Was it even in this century? No! Is there any one... is there any one still alive who's willing to stand up here tonight and tell us, the law he voted for, god only knows when, Still applies? Then why... Then why are we living with it? And more than that... And more than that, why are we still Letting ourselves get killed because of it? That's insensible! May I speak? Because you did not vote for a law does not make it invalid. This is not the old west, you're not gonna end an argument with a shootout... Yes on g! - Are you willing to throwaway 100 years of civilization? - Yes on g. Yes on g! - Who is it? - Alicia. I want you to tell me if you really believe in what you're doing. Okay, all right. When I said that guns don't start revolutions, Alicia, I meant it. Poverty starts revolutions and greed and corruption and hate and suppression. Talk to me about you. Tell me what you feel, not what you think. I'm telling you what I feel. Alicia, as long as there are people out there who are expected to live their lives without hope, without chance and with nothing to look forward to expect more of the same, None of us is gonna be entirely free. And every one of us, no matter how innocent we think we are, has the same chance that Katie and Angela did of ending up the victim of somebody else's anger. - That's how I feel. - What are you saying, Chris? That if there were total equality there would be no crime in this country? That rich people don't kill, don't steal, don't buy drugs? - That's not what I'm saying. - Oh, then what are you saying, Chris? That we should fear everyone? That we should... we should forget about trust, about basic decency, About love, about all those things that we've always wanted to believe in? You asked a question, Alicia, I answered it. Talk to me like a friend. Not like an enemy. What kind of friend? What... Good friend, close friend, best friend? What have we ever been to each other, Alicia? Tell me. - Well, if we haven't been close, let's start now. - Why? Because we need each other, Chris. Because we're both hurt. And that is what all of this is about. That isn't what this is about, Alicia. All I can tell you... is don't stop believing in fairy tales and happy endings except for the ones that tell you that believing in things makes them come true. Food doesn't come from dreams. A decent place to live won't come out of a wishing well. And if someone doesn't have any... any... happiness or self-respect or love don't expect him to wait forever. He might end up hating me and you because we got what he didn't. And he can't figure out, why? You don't see much hope, do you? Not like this. I'd fight for another way if I knew one. Well, I don't think you ever are gonna find it, Chris, until you stop fighting. Goodnight. Whether we're for or against the controversial proposition being voted out today, We're surely witnessing a powerful reaffirmation of the Democratic process. What began just a short time ago with the personal outrage and pain of one man, one citizen of one community in America, will end at 8:00 this evening with an echo that may well be heard beyond the borders of St. Lawrence. Will it be the start of something new? Or will it be the end of something old? We'll have to wait and see. Hello. Congratulations, you won by a landslide. God help us all. looks like you made a smart decision buying this gun two weeks ago and getting the background check out of the way before this place turned into a mad house. Can you believe this crowd? You had a good choice, too. This is a beautifully balanced little automatic. Here, take it. That's it. Feels good, doesn't it? Now, the full clip, the gun weighs less than two pounds. Magazine holds six shots, one more in the chamber. Very little kick, nice trigger action. And this little push button safety here is about as simple as they come. I feel so... I don't know... Sometimes I wish I hadn't even bought it. Believe me I know how you feel. We get customers in here all the time who feel just like that. It's not something you want. It might be something you need. Uh, how do I, um... - Uh, I mean, do I need a license of some kind? - No. It's all taken care of. Paperwork you filled out two weeks ago. But don't I have to, um... I mean, isn't there some kind of a test - that I should take? - Test? Yeah, uh, well I thought, you know, when you drive you have to give a test before you can drive. Oh, like a shooting test? No, no, nothing required by law. Well, may be a good idea to take it on the range and practice a little shooting as to get familiar with it. But there's no law. I can just fix you up with a box of ammo and... You're on your way. You can't keep beating a dead horse, Ev. We got a Democratic process here, they had a ballot, they had a vote. Now, you just got to relax old-timer, that's all there is to it. Good morning, Chris. - Mr. Mayor. - Well, congratulations, young man. Whether we like it or not, the people have spoken. Let's just pray that it doesn't backfire on us. Well, I'm afraid I don't share the mayor's generosity. Now, Ev, there's nothing we gain by disparagement. Disparagement, hell! We're not in some kind of a popularity contest here, this is life! And this guy's trying to kill us. Haven't you figured that out yet? Hasn't anybody? Has everyone lost their minds? Am I the only sane one left? Dang! Damn it. - What time is it? - It's day time. Yeah? Where are we? - St. Lawrence, some place. - Where the hell is that? - Somewhere. - Yeah? Great! We've got work to do, man. What the hell! Nuts in this town or what? What's going on? Did somebody call a walkout and forget to tell me? It's just real quiet, Mike. Quiet? Now we've got two, maybe, 3000 people walking around outside with guns on. You're telling me it's quiet? It's a fact, Mike. Quiet as a tomb. Like everybody is waiting around For the other guy to be the first one who pulls the trigger. Maybe. But maybe, old Chris knew what he was doing all along. - I - have Alicia frost on line two, Chris. Hello. Well thanks, I... You don't exactly sound like you mean it. Sure! I'd like that. Can I pick you up? Alright, I'll see you at 8:00. Bye. - Mom. - Hmm... Will grandma read me a story tonight? - Well, did you ask her? - No. - But if you ask her, she will. - Okay. - Mom. - Hmm? What are putting in your purse? Oh, it's nothing honey. According to the city clerk's office, Tuesday's voter turn out for the controversial proposition g ballot was one of the highest in St. Lawrence's history of the registered voters in the city. Good evening, Mr. Booth. Please come in, sir. Thank you, Henry. Miss frost asked me to tell you that she'll be down in a few minutes. All right. Congratulations on your victory, Mr. Booth. Well, thank you, Henry. - What side were you on? - The losing side. But I can understand why so many people voted the way they did. Why do you think they did? Because they're white, Mr. Booth. I believe the actual figure for this state is 90% white. I wasn't, uh, aware of the exact number. The curious thing is black people and Mexicans and Puerto Ricans and Cubans have been shooting up one another for a long time. But nobody ever seem to pay much attention or do much about it until it was the white folks who started getting killed. Enjoy your evening, Mr. Booth. Thank you, Henry. Hi. You look very pretty. Thank you. Oh! Sorry. Sorry. I'll probably stay through the rest of the week and leave this weekend. I got an offer on my house this afternoon. - I didn't know you put it up for sale! - Mmm-hmm. Are you going to take it? I got no reason to keep it. Chris, you can't live in a hotel room for the rest of your life. The rest of my life. All right, everybody freeze. Go clean them out. Hold it! Who else, who else wants to be a hero? Talking to Robbie Curtis here. Now, Robbie, uh, he was responsible for the shooting, uh, actually, four shootings here. - Robbie, I want to know... - Yeah. How did you happen to be in the area? What were you doing around here at that time? Do you have a lot of experience with guns before, uh, Robbie? But what I really want to know is... Can we have a comment from you, Mr. Booth? Uh... Miss frost and I just arrived. Are you aware of what happened here tonight? Well, apparently there were two dozen witnesses to armed robbery and murder. Four dead in the car and one live hero, is that accurate? Yes, sir. Then, I don't see any reason and I don't have any intention of wasting taxpayers' money on a likely investigation. We heard the two men who were shot by the killers, they had guns. Did you know that, Mr. Booth? Would you care to comment on that, sir? The people voted guns to protect themselves. Tim Reese, who was the checker, 24 years old. The other man, the one outside, who's 26, and both of them had guns, Both of them fired first, Mr. Booth. But neither of them hit what they were aiming at. Would you tell us how you feel about that, sir? Are you having any second thoughts about prop g? Do you have any comment at all, Mr. Booth? Mr. Booth? You got something you wanna say, Alicia, say it. All right. I think what you have done, Chris, is exploit the deaths of Angela and Katie. I think you've capitalized on your sorrow. I think you have become a symbol for all the worst qualities in all of us. Do you remember when you told me about all those hopeless people? The ones with no past and no future. You've become part of 'em. The only thing that you have really accomplished since you've started all of this is to drag people down to your own level. You didn't want to suffer alone so you made other people suffer with you. Then tell me how to stop suffering? Angela and Katie are dead, Chris, you are alive. Start living again. Oh, come on, give a guy a break. It's 3:00 in the morning, Chris. What's going on? You know about tonight? - The market? Yeah, I just got the bell a half an hour ago. - Yeah. And? And what? Was it my fault? The check on the guy out front... Maybe if they hadn't had guns, who knows? I don't know what to tell you, Chris. Look, The last thing me or any other cop wants to see is more guns on the street. It doesn't matter whether it's in the hands of the good guys or the bad guys. But you can't blame yourself, Chris. No more than Henry Ford gets blamed every time somebody piles their car into a tree. You figure it was my fault. You don't have to nail yourself to a cross, Chris. If you want out, all you got to do is jump. The law is only as good as the people behind it. If they don't like it, they can change it back to the way it was. If they like it any better they don't... The future's in their hands not yours. What's that quote you told me from Thomas Jefferson, the one about rebellion? Mmm-mmm. I don't think he was talking about this. Styles wants to see you. Don't look at me. I'm just passing on the message. You can do whatever you want to do about it. It makes me nervous if you don't sit down. They told you I wanted to see you, huh? I'm here. I didn't think they would. What do you want? I'm sorry about the kid. Are you trying to cop a plea, styles? Just want to get your attention, Chris. I know who you are, man. I know about that law you got passed. That's a good law. That's a real good law. It won't be long... You'll have more blood on your hands than I do. You got anything else you wanna say, styles. I got places I'd rather be. Me, too, Chris. But you know, for guys like me and you Those places ain't much better than right here. You tell the mayor, if he goes through with this, I'll not only defy him publicly, but I'll walk. Is that clear, councilwoman? Can't you look at this as good public relations, Ev? Public relations? We make a formal presentation, nothing big. It doesn't have to be ostentatious. And we give this young man, Robbie Curtis, a little medal of some kind. We say it's for bravery, courage, good citizenship. Think about it, Ev. The eyes of the country are on St. Lawrence these days. You can't deny that. And you also can't deny that the boy did something unique, a noble selfless deed. Let's commend him for it. That's all we're suggesting, just a simple commendation. This boy you're talking about, Fired ten rounds from a pair of .44 magnums into a moving car. - Ev, I think you're... - Not another word, councilwoman. Not another word! Congratulations. Here you go, Robbie. From the grateful people of the city of St. Lawrence. Congratulations. We're proud of you, very proud of you. Good job. Brave citizen. Hell with it! Let them try and fire me. Chris? Do you have a few minutes? Sure. I'm going to be leaving, Chris. What? I'm frightened, Chris. It's as simple as that. I... I don't want to live in this city anymore. Things are gonna settle down, Rosalind. We just have to give it some time. Last night when I came home, the building superintendent he was, uh, wearing a gun. And at the coffee shop where I have breakfast every morning, The cashier had a gun. And there was another shooting today, Chris, at Willis point. I can't live like that. I'm not that brave, I guess. Will two weeks' notice be enough? Rosalind... Look, I've always tried to find the best in... In a person, you know. I, uh... and maybe it's naive, I don't... But I've always lived like that. I still have hope for this world, Chris. But I can't live where hope is dead. I'll get it, Henry. Hi. Hi. I was just packing. When are you leaving? Tonight, around 10:00. I was hoping I could spend some time with you, before you left. I thought maybe we could try talking about... Something different, anything different. I wonder if that's possible. We should try. Did Angela ever bring you up here? No. This used to be one of our favorite places. We used to ride our bikes up here when we were kids. Tell each other our problems and... Make all sorts of promises we probably never kept. This is where we came the afternoon my mother died. I just cried and cried. Angela just held me. This is where we came when we first tried smoking cigarettes, too. Angela was better at it than I was. At least she looked better at it than I did. Who quit first? Well, she did. That's the way she was, right? The first to try something and the first to be gutsy enough to admit it was dumb. I didn't sleep much last night. Maybe not at all. Yeah, me neither. For the first time, I thought about how Angela and Katie would have felt about prop g. Angela would have hated it 'cause she... Hated violence of any kind. And Katie... Katie would have felt the same way. Because when you're six, you love everybody. Except, even now, Alicia... Even now, I still don't know if the alternative is any better. What's better, Chris? What's got to be better is believing in people. I don't mean a blind faith, Or a child's faith, but believing that there is more good than bad. You're still a little kid yourself, aren't you? In some ways? Hmm? Yeah, I guess, I am. I hope I always will be. You know, I may be back home over Christmas, but... What would you think about coming to Washington for Thanksgiving? How's your stuffing? Oh, it's better than most. I asked you nicely to put out the cigar until we were finished here. You gonna make me take it away from you? Sue me. Say it again... Big mouth. Oh, my god! Oh! Mmm-hmm. Okay. Yes, I understand. Good-bye. That was Marjorie Lucas. City council might call for another vote. People are having second thoughts. Does that surprise you? Maybe not. Maybe you should think about staying around a little longer. I've done all I can this time. What are you gonna do? - I don't know. - When are you going to decide? I don't know, maybe we're just going to have to... Wait till all of us are walking around ankle deep in blood. Before we wake up to the idea that if we don't start fighting the problems instead of each other, Nothing's ever gonna change. What good is the right of the people, Chris, without the heart?
