[tense instrumental] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [water running] ♪ [Bella] You got a hitch in your giddy-up. And that can feel never-ending. But when that overwhelming urge to self-medicate hits you, that is exactly when you need to lean on someone for help. It's the only way forward. You need someone to help pull you back on the healthier path. And that someone can be a family member, a neighbor, an old friend... a new friend. You know, maybe someone in this very group. So, we have all been there. We are all still there. And we are all facing the same four tasks. One, to accept the reality of the loss. Anyone want to continue with the next one? To experience the pain of grief. [Bella] And the third? Ronnie? Adjust to an environment where the deceased is missing. [Bella] And the fourth. To emotionally relocate the deceased and move on. Right. We all share these tasks. And we all understand at least an element of what you are going through. This is what binds us together. All right, that's about all the time we have for tonight. Um, does anyone wanna add anything before we go? Will? How about you? You've been quiet. You wanna share something? Uh. No. I don't have anything at the moment. Of course. In your own time. All right, well, that does it. Oh, uh, and just a reminder for those of you with court orders, see me afterwards and I will get them signed for you. See you tomorrow. -Ronnie. Always a pleasure. -[Ronnie whispering] Thanks. Take care. Lydia, I think that you can work a little harder to participate [Lydia] I am doing the best I can, child. [Bella] You have more, you have great things to share. [Lydia] All right, that's fine. You signed it? Thank you. [Bella] Yeah, I just wish-- [ominous music playing] [shaky exhale] You know, I like to keep groups like this small. More intimate. I find it makes people feel more comfortable expressing themselves. Speaking their truth. Do you like small groups, Will? Yeah. Works for me, I guess. I certainly hope so. ♪ [crickets chirping] Hey, Will, hold up. Need a ride someplace? -No, I'm good. -I'm Bryan, by the way. Yeah, I remember. From the meeting. -I'm gonna head out. -It's a group. We're a group. It's a group. -Yeah, okay. -Well, you called it a meeting. And a meeting could be different factions coming together for a brief period, but a group functions as a whole. We help each other. We're a group. [whispers] Right. So, Bella wants us to call it a group and that's what you're saying? See you next time. In group.

It's like every second of every waking hour, it's just... -I just keep going through the-- -The what-ifs. Yeah, right, the fucking what-ifs. Like, what if-- what if we had left five minutes later instead of always insisting that we leave five minutes early? Should be a sixth stage. A sixth stage to grief? Reversal. I-- I'm not sure we understand, Lydia. What if you could reverse it? [Bella] Okay, so, this is what bargaining is about. You're bartering with yourself in your own head in an attempt to change something that cannot be changed. -But what if there was a way? -[Bella] Lydia. There are those what-ifs again and that is a dangerous game to play. Yeah. Whatever you say. [tense music] Okay, that was a very-- Will. Something on your mind? It just seems to me that if there's five stages to this thing then... I don't know, it just seems to-- to close our minds to other options. Other options? Options, stages, levels, I don't know, uh, just seems to limit us. Well, Will, I appreciate the, uh, many levels of your opinion, I can assure you that what Lydia is dealing with is-- Not talking about her. Uh-oh. -Unsatisfied customer? -Oh, no. Not at all. Uh, Will was just expressing concern for Lydia. -Oh. -[Bella] Oh. Thank you, Will. Take that all into consideration. ♪ [crickets chirping] [Lydia] Almost like they don't want us to get better. How about you? -You feeling any better yet? -Not really. [scoffs] No, not at all. You're not like the others. I could tell. So, why are you stuck here? My heart got ripped open. I was sad. Then angry. And sad again. Then angry all the time. Shit happened. And they thought I needed some group time to get my head right. -Is it working? -[Lydia] No. I'm horrible. [laughs] Constantly horrible. But I'mma get better on my own. I'mma feel better. Real soon. 100%. I'mma see my baby again. [Bryan] Let me give you a ride. Come on. I could use the company.

Just doesn't quite pack the punch it used to. And that day was like any other day. I-- I had already seen misery. Already seen death. All in a day's work, right? So, I'm on my way home and I get one last call. And three blocks from the house... it was a single car collision, one person, I was third on the scene. I get there and I-- I-- I make my way down the embankment. It didn't look that bad, you know? Just upside down there and-- and the creek bed-- Dunbar Creek, uh, you know, ankle deep, usually. But shit, we had all that rain the night before. It was like God turned on the faucet, forgot to turn it off, you know? [voice breaking] She never had a chance. She hit her head. She's just hanging there upside down and her head in the water. All that life ahead of her. That was the one. That was the one that got stuck right here. That was the one. Thank you, Bryan. That was very brave and you are wonderful for sharing. [tense music playing] Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Now, that's often misattributed to Mr. Albert Einstein, but the point is clear. I know that dealing with overwhelming grief day after day can make you feel like you are insane. And we all know what the result is going to be when we express our grief to each other. A little bit of relief, no matter how brief, from the guilt, anger, sadness, whatever it is that we are feeling inside. Now, let me be clear. There is nothing wrong with temporary relief. No matter what stage we are at. But if you begin to live life only for that relief, for the next blackout from reality, you are not learning. You're not growing. You are not healing. So, to make Einstein, or whoever said that quote happy, We're going to do something a little different. Instead of expressing our grief to each other, we are going to write a note or a letter to our departed. [Lydia mutters] Something you want to add, Lydia? No. I'm all set. Not interested in breaking the cycle, Lydia? I'm almost done with my cycle forever. Thanks. [Ronnie] What's that supposed to mean? Sounds like lady problems to me. [scoffs] Stupid motherfuckas.

[crickets chirping] [ominous music plays] Something I can help you with, man? Because if this is about a ride, I'm good. Brother, you're stuck in a shit cycle right now, going round and round and round, and nowhere in that circle is the starting point to the healing process. You don't know anything about me. I know what those cough drops are for. And that is not the answer. That much I know. Brother, waking life, it can be tolerable. Not perfect, but tolerable. But it starts by getting out of the circle of despair. It sure sounds like you had that memorized. So, let me guess. It's vodka on the way in because it has the weakest scent, right? Then pop a few menthols and you're on cruise control through a whole new group. Right? And on the way home, pick up a bottle of your favorite stuff. Just to get you through the night.

You wanna stop living in their dream world of despair? What do you mean? Like drugs? I'm talking about not living with the reality they keep preaching to us. You interested? Yes. There's this place hidden away. Follow these directions. Go to that place. Tell 'em I sent you. Go to that place, Will. Then, you'll see. You'll open your eyes. No more sadness. Only joy. -[crickets chirping] -[eerie music] [Von] Home, sweet home. It's not much but... they say home is really in here and here, right? [Will whispering] Yeah. Keeps demons away.

I'm sorry, you're, um-- Von. -My name's Von. -I'm Will. I'm here on Tuesdays and Thursdays, Will. [Will whispering] Okay. [crickets chirping] So, what brings you out this way tonight? Um, Lydia. Lydia, she said that I should come here. That I should come see you. Lydia. But your path and her path are very different. I can tell. Though no two paths are ever the same. What did Lydia tell ya? Just that I should come see you and there'll be no more sadness. You experienced loss. [Von sighs] Take this. Draw, sketch, paint. Do whatever you want. Put it on that canvas and bring it back to me.

All right, well, that's about it for tonight, um, but before we go, I do want to address something. As you have probably noticed, Lydia is not here tonight and moving forward, she will no longer be a part of this group. Now, of course, we wish her the best on her healing journey, but I would like to remind you all that when one in the group refuses to do the tasks, it can damage the healing of the whole group. Sometimes permanently. See you guys tomorrow. Oh. Hey, Bryan. Will. Good meeting tonight, right? Hey, I see you doing the work and I am proud of you, brother. -Okay. -I knew I'd get through to you. We're gonna have your head thinking straight before you know it. So, I'm curious. Why isn't Lydia coming back? She claims she doesn't need the group anymore. So, just like that, she's cured. She believes her daughter has come back to her. -Come back? -Yeah. Her departed has come back. [Bryan] It's tragic, really. I mean, you've heard her babbling on, Will. Obviously, it's impossible. What are we talking about here? Turning back time? I mean, we-- we can only try to help, -but sometimes we-- -Fail. -[paper rustling] -Did not fail. [inhales] She chose not to accept help. Yeah. Sounds tragic. -Will! What the fuck was that? -Not tonight, Bryan. Hey. I know this is about checking a list for you, man, but pulling shit like that is only going to prolong this. The more you resist what is here to help you, the longer it's going to take for you to see the light. Don't try and be a cop with me, man. How dare you say that to me? I'm here to help you. What's going on in there is not helping anyone. It's just rehashing the same horrible shit over and over again. That's the cycle. You need to wake up, brother. [crickets chirping] I was wondering if you were gonna make your way up here tonight. You know, it's funny, everybody can express themselves. So, everyone is an artist. What comes out of here... it ends up there. The artist's history. A life lived. Lessons learned. Growth. Improvements. Discovery of truth. [Will] You know, Lydia is making some pretty bold claims. And people are making some pretty bold claims about Lydia. Lydia is on her own path, and you are on yours, Will. This your daughter in this? It's okay if you don't know. This kind of work, it exists in two spaces. A physical space and a psychological space. -You are truly a bright soul. -Oh, I don't know about that. I want you to look at all those souls up there. Look. Did you know when a star dies, it continues to shine its light across the universe for many millenniums to come? You just got to be looking for that light. So, what are you willing to do? -To do for what? -You know for what, Will. Lydia was willing to approach her obstacle with an open mind. And with truly open eyes. Now, all her sadness is gone. There's nothing I wouldn't do. -For your sadness to be gone. -To end the cycle. Me and my daughter. Shelly. Oh, no, no. I-- I-- I couldn't take your vinyl. These are meant for someone who needs them.
