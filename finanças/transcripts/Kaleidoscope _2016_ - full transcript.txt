Hello? Hello? Well, I... I must have just missed you. Yeah, I just got back so I was wondering if you could maybe come.. What? No, it's not a complaint. It... it's just, you said it would probably be some time this afternoon I was sort of depending on. Uh, yeah, it, it fills up with water and then it just... just stops. Through here. Afternoon. I can't speak. They're going to leave me to die up here. You must promise to bury me. I can always carry you down. If they don't fix them lifts soon I'm going to jump down. Then you'll see how quick they move. Did you see the police was here? They found something.. ...body parts I heard. Oh, they didn't have any palm oil so I went to that shop around the corner. Oh. Uh-ah. I didn't know you cared. No, no, no, that.. It's... it's wrong bag. It's all mixed up. Does she have a name? Kitten Gloves 35. So tell me you're not wearing that. Well, it's... it's the only clean shirt I've got. The agency were meant to come round and fix the washing machine. So have one of Jonah's. Oh, no, that's alright. Then what am I keeping them for? Well, if you're sure. Hello? Hello. Hello. We are not available at the moment. Please leave your name and number after the tone and we will return your call as soon as possible. I didn't expect you'd pick up. Only what it was is.. ...I've an, an appointment in London tomorrow and... well, I was hoping maybe we could.. But maybe I'll call back. Fucking hell. No wonder you gave up smoking. - In here? - Oh, yeah. Hold on. - Drink? - Oh, yeah. You sit down if you like, I... I'll get you one. I bet you don't get much gardening done up here. Oh, no. That's just my business. Well, gonna be once I get a van. Mm. You've got a businessman's face. I'd rather have his wallet. What are these? Oh, herbs. Ooh! Huh. My mum used to buy those basil plants in a pot. - Ocimum basilicum. - Hm. But the leaves keep going black. I think she just likes the smell of it on her fingers. Your mum's probably got a touch of black spot. Uh, it's easier to grow basil from the seed. Preferably facing the equator. - Ooh, is that right? - Yeah. They actually don't like this climate very much. - Do you mind if I, uh.. - Oh. Yeah. Oh, cheers. So, where's all your, em... stuff? Stuff? Yeah, you know, stuff. I don't really have much stuff. Hm. Sea breeze? How did you know that? You put it down as one of your likes. Oh, very good. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Oh. - Oh, God! Sorry, I, I couldn't find any cranberry so I had to use blackcurrant. And you? You haven't had a proper drink all night. Alcohol a problem, is it? No, it's just.. - No. - What? Sends me off. Where to? I don't know, somewhere else. Isn't that the idea? Have you got any music? iPod or somethin'? You got a radio? Oh, that sets the neighbor's dog off. Aah, that's his problem. Well, he's pretty aggressive. What sort of dog is it? No, I didn't mean the dog. - Where's your dog anyway? - I haven't got a dog. You said you had a dog. - I don't get along with dogs. - On your profile. You said that you were an animal lover. Well, animals are okay. So what else have you lied about then? No, no, it's was just.. You look at other people's profiles, you.. got to put something down, haven't you? How many girls have you bought back here then? - From the site? - Hm. I don't know, but some. - Name one then. - What? A girl that you bought back here. - Uh, how do you mean? - Come on, you're stallin'. - Rosie. Rose. - Rose. Yeah. Up from the country, was she? Well... well, what's your real name? Come on, let's look up her profile. Where's your computer? Ah, I use the one at the library. You're a sneaky snake. So what does that make you? - Thirsty. - Same again? Yep. And hold the blackcurrant, yeah. We used to have a dog, years ago. Before you had to pick up the turds. How did you end up here then? Doesn't fit. You don't fit. That shirt. What're you talking about? It's, it's hand made. - It's a genuine one off. - Hm. No wonder. Would you say that that I was your sort? Sorry. Men, they either go for their mothers or the opposite. And I'm guessing.. Um, your nose is, uh.. Oh. Uh. Um. - I've got these, do you.. - No, it's alright. - Are you sure? - Ugh. Shit. Telescope. Are you okay? You've got to turn that down. - Oh, come on. - Come on, he'll go mad. If he's got a problem he can come and fuck with me. Were you looking for something? Uh, cigarette papers. - I don't smoke. - You don't drink. You don't smoke, you don't dance. Maybe you'd rather read a book. Sorry. What's your name? - Cheers! - Cheers! If it sends you off somewhere I'll come and get you. Whoo! Whoo! Come on. Yeah. That's it. Come on. Whoo! How long since you've been out? How do you mean? How do you think I mean? Come here. That's it, hold on tight. Give us a twirl. No, me. That's it. Again. And again. Yeah. Whoo! Oh! Are you alright? Are you alright? Abby? I'm gonna be sick. I didn't expect you'd pick up. Only what it was is.. ...I have an, an appointment in London tomorrow and well, I was hoping maybe we could.. But maybe I'll call back. This is Aileen's phone. Leave a mess.. This is Aileen's phone. Leave a message, loud and clear for an old lady. I don't want you here. - So don't... - Do you mind? I, uh, I borrowed a T-shirt. Where've you gone? You're not speaking to me now? - You already had papers. - What? You said you were looking for cigarette papers. They were in my bag. Loose a fridge in that. Who was that on the phone? Are you in trouble? You can tell me. I know what trouble looks like I got married to it. He's not my husband for much longer. Even sold my ring. Dick. What... what are you doing here? I'm trying to be nice. Do you wanna know why I chose you? Because you looked like a pushover. That's the routine. See. Now I am being nice and honest. I actually think you're alright. Oh, fine then. And it's Abby. By the way, since you're askin'. I'm sorry. Um.. ...I got out about a year ago. I'm not asking you to stay with me. You, you can sleep on the bed. I'll go on the sofa downstairs. I've got eggs and bacon. Hello. See how the colors change. Uh, the door's stuck. I can't open the door. The door's stuck. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. At least, forgive, forgive me for this. Here. Sit down. Sit down. Get up. I'm so sorry. If it sends you off somewhere. I'll come and get you. Hello, we are not available at the moment please leave your name and number after the tone and we will return your call as soon as possible. I didn't expect you'd pick up. Only what it was is.. ...I have an, an appointment in London tomorrow and.. Your nice neighbor let me in. I took a tumble.. ...coming up on the concrete steps. Clumsy idiot. I even tore my dress. I doubt it will get all the dirt out. I was hoping you might have a plaster. Do you have a plaster? Could you help me with a plaster? I'm not touching you. Shut the door on your way out. I might at least clean myself up. I've been travelling all day. Sink's over there. Get away from it. I don't know how to stop it. It just started making a noise. Just leave. Now. Well, it's dark. Where would I go? Out! Maybe your neighbor has a sofa. You're not to go over there. Then where do I go? I don't care. You can't stay there. One night. See how the colors change? I hadn't realized how hungry I was. It's liver, your favorite. You have no idea what I like. It's what you used to like. I can look after myself. I learnt that much. I've got a business to run. Did I hear you say, a business? You're upstairs. I'm happy to take the sofa. Upstairs. You look well. I was. You have one new message. New message. I'm here. Where the fuck are you? If he's touched you, I'll break his neck. - Hello? - I'm looking for someone. What's the name? I've got a picture. Uh.. - I'm sorry. - Have a look. I am. My wife. - She's here. - Not here. On the estate. I'll ask my wife. Have you seen her, love? No, no. Me, neither. Sorry. Is, um.. Is there a name? Just in case. Hmm.. Touch me. You asked me to stay. You're hurting me. Ahh! Oh! My foot. You've broken my foot. - Out! - Don't. No, Carl, I don't.. Uh, I don't deserve this. I don't deserve this! Out! Carl. Carl. Carl! Before you say it I'm leaving now. You look like a clown. I've got an appointment.. ...someone special. I wouldn't think anyone's that desperate. Not like that. There hasn't been anyone.. ...not since you went away. What do I care? I've got my own to think of now. A girlfriend? - And one on the way. - Mm. I'm happy for you. Maybe I should take you both out. My treat. It's a bit late for that. I told her you were dead. I'll pick my case up later when you're not here. That's alright? Carl? Carl? Is everything okay? Oh, she didn't turn up. Then that wasn't you and Kitty-Kat that passed here last night? No, I was in all evening. And you didn't hear all that banging and bashing in front of the door early this morning? This morning? When I came down, they'd gone. I'll be late for work. Carl? Hello, Carl. Maureen. I was wondering if you were around late last night. No. Uh, it's just one of the clients said she saw someone moving about in the roses. Oh. A fox? No, she swears it was a man. I was thinking, it's probably best if we keep the key to the side door in the office from now on. Just to be on the safe side. Why are you still here? Who said you could smoke? Will you sit down, Carl? I've something to tell you. What? A new beginning, I hope. Might take a few days to clear. I won it.. ...on the lottery. I want us to make up. I was thinking. I might go and visit my sister in Canada. We've started talking again. Do you remember your cousin, Casper? You once made a pact you would do down Niagara Falls in a wooden barrel. Remember? Used to obsess you, those men in barrels. Forever hiding yourself away in small spaces. "I'm just practicing for the falls," you'd say. I doubt you'd both get in one now. We could even go first class. An adventure. Is there no way to start again? After all this time. But I haven't had any time. All my time has been taken away. Well.. ...I don't have much of it left myself. The oncologist says it's in my bones. Where's your medication? No, I don't need it. There's no pain. Not yet. I don't believe you. Look, if it'll make you hate me any less why don't you ring the consultant? Here, Dr. Burman. He won't lie. Maybe you're not the only one that's allowed to change. How long have you been here now, Carl? Uh, about a year, uh, just over. Have you stayed anywhere else? No, this was the first place I got. Your downstairs neighbor, Mr. Prempeh recalls hearing... Loud music, dancing and voices. Voices. Plural. - Yes. - Yes? Yes, plural. My mother was staying. - Dancing? - Uh, no. - I... I was dancing. - While she was? - Watching. - Uh, complaining actually. She doesn't like music and she wanted me to turn it off. Is your mother still staying? Uh, no, she left this afternoon. - Not from London then? - Isle of Wight. - Did she stay long? - Three or four days. Three or four? Four. Did either of you leave the flat that night? No. Thank you. Silly me. I left it on the bedroom lamp. So.. ...I'll say goodbye. If that's what you want. Is that what you want? Carl. I think I might have missed my last train. I've been through all of your shirts. None of them is missing a button. They've arrested someone. The husband. Well, it's always the ones that are closest. Denies it, of course. He says she left the nightclub with another man. So they've checked the CCTV. It seems the cameras were either fake or broken. So they've put the word out for someone with a mobile who might have taken pictures. The husband's a drug addict. What more do they want? Sawing a girls legs off. Can you imagine the mess? I was thinking about Ca... Canada. - Wh... - I can't hear you. Uh, about Canada. I... I'd have to get my passport renewed. Just like that? Is... Isn't that what you were suggesting? Last I heard you were starting a family. I thought she could come. You'll have some explaining to do. You told her I was dead remember? I'll sa... say it was a joke. You never had the wit for jokes. Does she have a name? Rose. What does Rose do with herself I wonder? Works with dogs. Walks 'em. She's a dog walker. You don't like dogs. And is that who you were with? Rose? Yes. Stayed the night, did she? Yes. But you didn't think to tell that to the police. Well, we'd, we'd had an argument and.. ...I thought if.. ...I said she was here. They might think she was the poor dead girl. Yes. Did you have a drink, Carl? Did you have a little drink? Why don't you come in where I can see you? Come in, little woodpecker. Out of the compound and down the street they were. Everyone had an eye for Jonah. But that was before we came here. Always you think something will be better somewhere else. But things are never what you imagine. You don't want it? He's being polite. He's already eaten. Then leave it. It's okay. The police were here askin' questions about that poor girl. Oh, you don't want to read about it but you do, don't you? You can't help yourself. Cut her up into bits. Threw her away like a piece of rubbish. Right here in one of these flats. No. They've arrested someone. Not any more, they let the husband go. - Why? - New leads. Is all they said. Carl? Would you bring me a plaster? Carl. Can you bring me a plaster? You'll have to clean it first. I must have scraped it.. ...when I sat down. Did you have sex with her? That's something I can't wash out. You left clues everywhere. Don't you remember how happy we were? Where is the phone? Happiness to kill for. You destroyed it. The phone! Uh! Aah! Aah! Carl, open the door, please. I only want to help you. Please. Open the door. Carl, I need you. See how the colors change. Do you like it, son? Uh, the door's stuck. Got it on the ferry over, remember? Happy as a jumping bean you were. When I came back for you. I didn't even recognize you. Staring back at me with your mother's eyes. Hello. I can't open the door. I don't blame you, Carl. She filled you full of poison. Carl.. ...touch me. I can't open the door. Please, I can't open the door. I'm going to stay. Will you open the fucking door? I can see you. Hey. No... no... no... no. Wesley, stop it! Get the fuck out! Get out! Fuck's sake. For fuck's sake. What the fuck have you done to my jeans? Where's my stuff? Here. Uh. What have you done to my stuff? It's fucked. Where's my phone? I don't know. You, you said.. If it... it... it sent me somewhere. You'd come and get me. You broke my foot.
