I'm back. Welcome home. To where? To Sunny Heights. Good work! Don't you have to have you checked? How? Are you telling me to go see a gynecologist? Saying what? Jun, will you come with me? Every day, I was feeling as if to have a giant mass of lead from the chest to the stomach. I was at a loss. I couldn't ask anyone for advice. I hesitated to call Toroko many time because I didn't want to show how much I was shocked. But I ended up calling her after all. Hello. What happened? What're you doing? Nothing. Did you watch some interesting videos recently? Not much. Ah...I was wondering if you could recommend me something interesting... Never mind, so... I'll call you. Wait. What? I wanted to recommend you one. What is it? "A Place in the Sun". Have you ever watched it? No. It stars Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift. I recommend it. I'm sure you'll like it. Really? Then I'll go rent it. To take my mind off of it, I rented the video Toroko recommended me. As I had no appetite and had eaten almost nothing but beer for a few days. However, to my surprise, that movie was about a young guy with a beautiful fiancé who was demanded by his pregnant ex to marry her. Being at a loss, he killed his ex in a lake in the mountain. In the end, the guy was sentenced to death. I recommend it. That night, I had a terrifying dream. In my dream, like the movie I watched earlier, I accidentally killed Toroko. I found the first star of evening! Did you make a wish on the star? I tell you my wish. My with is to have a child and live with you in three happily however poor we are. Stop it. Why? Please stop it. Jun. What kind of wish did you make on the star? That you wouldn't want to be with me who is now pregnant and a burden to you? Or that I would even die? No. Please say nothing. Poor Jun. Hey, don't be so down. Don't stand up! I... Don't stand up! Are you Jun Kuroita? Yes. You rented "A Place in the Sun" this evening, didn't you? Yes. There's something I need to ask you. Please come to the office. No, no. No, I'm not! Hello. Fill her up, premium. Tickets or cash? Cash. OK. Excuse me. Yes? By any chance, are you Jun Kuroita? I'm Nakai! We were in the same class at elementary school. Oh, Nakai... What a surprise! That's why you looked familiar. I had no idea you were working here. How have you been since then!? You went to Hokkaido, didn't you? We sometimes talked about you. Yeah. Now I call others. Let's all meet tonight. Yeah, can you wait a second? Sure, can you wash my car while I call others? Yes. Not yet? No. But don't worry. When did you come back to Tokyo? Soon after I graduated junior high. So you went a high school here. Yeah, though it was a night school. You are working in a gas station, aren't you? Yes. How much are you making? About 150,000 yen a month. I see. You are all university students, right? Kuroki, Nakai and Yuka go to Keio University. Tamagawa goes to Rikkyo, Sakai and Nishimura go to Tokyo University. Impressive. Though it seems like they are more busy with fooling around than with studying. It's easy now. You can buy it in a pharmacy. Can you tell if you are pregnant or not without going to a hospital? How ignorant! You are so behind! Yuka, are you pregnant? No! I'm talking about a friend of mine. I don't commit such a blunder. Oh! Suspicious! You can but it in a pharmacy for 3000 yen. Soak the paper in your pee and wait three minutes. Yeah, three minutes. These three minutes are hell! If you are pregnant, the paper turn into a disappointing color. What kind of color is it? I told you, a disappointing color. The color of mortification... Yeah. Even the color of your tears must be disappointing. The next day I bought the testkit for pregnancy they were talking about in a pharmacy. And I met with Tamako in the usual love hotel. ♪ There is someone ♪ ♪ in the wheat field ♪ ♪ kissing with someone ♪ ♪ It's so nice ♪ A disappointing color appeared. ♪ Some day I'll also be with someone ♪ ♪ in the wheat field ♪ Jun. It's been a while. I called you some times but you were always out. I imagine you called me, too. I suddenly got busy as well, so I'm seldom at home. I'm sorry. I joined "the Association to Grow Forests in Hokkaido" invited by a friend So, on my day offs, I'm almost always out to go to the mountain. We are planting young plants of acorn in the barren mountains with other members. They are all amazing people. Now Hokkaido needs more broadleaf trees. People cut down many broadleaf trees during the settlement and planted only conifers, so... Jun. Yes? Someone are calling you. Thank you. Hello. Excuse me, Where is the room of Tamako Matsuda? Oh...room No.3 on the second floor. Thank you. Excuse me, my name is Kuroita. Sorry, I... Stop it! This is a clinic! Please calm down! I beg you, please! Please respect other patients! Write down. The name and the address of your guarantor. And the phone number. Where are your parents? Where in Hokkaido? My mom is dead. Your dad is alive, isn't he? Yes, but... You know, Takako is a daughter of my brother-in-law in Kagoshima. We are keeping his precious daughter in the custody. I'm so sorry but... This is my responsibility so... Hey... It has nothing to do with my dad so... please, please do not call my dad. Are you able to make compensation? After laying your hand on a daughter of someone and letting her abort, do you think you can get away with that? No. Then what do you do? How do you compensate? That... From now... Her father is a policeman. He would never hold back. What is the name of your father. Goro Kuroita. What's he doing? He is farming and working as a day laborer, and... Please don't tell him! The phone? He doesn't have one. Don't lie. It's true. The police can easily find out if you are telling us a lie or not. I'm telling the truth. He really doesn't have one. Then the address? What is the address? Furano... Write down. Even if you lie, it'll be soon exposed. Since that day, my appetite fell off even more. I absolutely didn't want my dad to know about it. He was the last person I wanted to drag into this. But it was too late. They told me not to show up any more in the clinic so I couldn't contact Toroko at all. I sometimes went to the pizzeria. But there wasn't Toroko. She might still be at the clinic. Four days passed, and five days passed. But I heard no news from anyone. Well... It was the very first time I took an airplane, wasn't it? Nakahata scared me so much! He said, when you get on the place, you should take off your shoes. So I took off my shoes and asked a flight attendant. "Excuse me, where are the shoe shelves?" Then she burst into laughing. Other passengers too. It was so embarrassing. Oh. I ate a lot! But don't you think Mikazuki Ramen is better? I don't know. So. now I go to see them. Can you come with me? Yes. OK. Can I ask you if you have an intention to get married? With that girl? I see. I understand. You are still young. Let's apologize anyway. Let's never talk back to them and just apologize earnestly. OK? If we keep apologizing in two, it will work. We have no other choice anyway. We have no other choice. I'm a professional when it comes to apologizing. Just do as I do. Just copy me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Oh, sorry. I'm Kuroita. I received your word. We are... sincerely sorry for... Oh, please accept this. This is just a little something as a sign of greeting... because I don't even have calling cards... Then, pardon me. Let's get inside. How much longer are you going to be like that? Please stop acting so theatrically. I understand well that you are barely scraping by and that you can't do anything. Please show your faces. I can't even talk. Anyway, please have some tea. Anyway, you rushed over here. I think that is your sign of sincerity. No... I... It's OK. I understand. Do you have a daughter? Yes. What's her name? She's called Hotaru. How old is she? She's 19. Is she dear to you? Yes. Please imagine this Hotaru was played around by a some yob and got pregnant. Then how would you feel? Please imagine that seriously. Her father is in Kagoshima. He is a policeman but hopelessly good-natured. I've been imagining for many days how my brother would feel when he learned the news. So, please imagine, you too. Your precious daughter Hotaru, not being able to ask anyone for advice, though embarrassed, look up a gynecologist and go to the clinic all by herself to be on the examination table. Imagine seriously that moment! You mentioned about sincerity. It might be the best of your sincerity for you to be here acting like that. But I can't find any sincerity in what you do. What is sincerity? Huh? You might be satisfied with flying from far, swallowing your pride to apologize with your hands and head on the ground. But if your daughter were in the shoes of Tamako... Never mind. I undestand. We're getting nowhere. Hey, they are leaving. And... let him bring back with him those pumpkins. Well... let's have a drink... It was exhausting, wasn't it? I'm a bit exhausted. I'm so sorry. Don't mind, don't mind. That's not what I meant. Have you heard that Sota got married? Yes. Actually, it was a disaster. Aiko were pregnant, but... Never mind. Let's not talk about this topic. Hotaru will come back in the spring. Really? Yeah. You know the Zaitsu Clinic in Sakae, don't you? She will be working there. I see. There is five months left. Five months of patience. Oh, by the way, Shokichi called on me. Shokichi? I was so surprised. He was in the uniform of Self-Defense Forces. He is now in Kamifurano Really? Yeah, what a surprise! Do you know Kinji? Kinji? Yeah, Kinji Kano, the master carpenter of Rokugo. No. Though he is younger than me by five years, now I became his apprentice. He is really something. He is something, although I had payed no attention to him before. I was feeling hurt because he didn't scold me. He was as poor as usual. I could tell that from his clothes, too. I had no idea how he made money but he flew for his son with an airplane for the first time in his life. For his son, he threw himself on the ground. For his son, he swallowed the pride. Dad, please scold me. Please don't change the subject. Yes? This song. What? What is the title? It's called "The song of Old Man in Nishi-shinjuku" by Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi. I see. Nice song. ♪ It’s now or never ♪ ♪ It’s now or never ♪ ♪ The 66 year-old man's pet phrase is ♪ ♪ It’s now or never ♪ Jun. You can come back to the New Year's Eve, right? Yes. Really? Yes. We promised. You have my word. Yes. You mentioned about the sincerity. What is the sincerity? But if your daughter were in the shoes of Tamako... You mentioned about the sincerity. But if your daughter were in the shoes of Tamako... You want to sell the logs? Yeah. The ones with which you're going to make the cabin? You were talking about the guy who wanted logs for a log house. I have 100 logs, already plained. How many do you want to sell? All of them. Do you give up building your house? No, I'll think about it from now. How much do you want? I'm fine with three million yen. Three million is the cost of logs. You spent a lot of time to plane them. It's OK. I don't charge for the planing. Why all of a sudden? I need money. You need as much as three million yen? No. I haven't finished repaying to Naka. Two million is what I have to pay to Naka. Does he know about this? No. Please don't tell him. I asked the guy. He wants them. Oh... that's great. He said three million is fine? Yeah. It helps me a lot. Goro. I ask you one more time. Why do you need such amount of money? For you, one million is a huge sum, isn't it? Yes. It's a huge sum I can barely afford. I can barely afford... That's the very reason why I really need it. This is the sincerity. Goro! Goro! What happened? I ran into a bear. Where!? Right there. When I turned the corner, there was it. Eight meters. No, five meters. Was it big? Like a calf. Your hair was standing on end. Was it? It's the first time I saw someone with the hair standing on end. Now I learned the hair can stand on end however sparse it is. Is it true that you sold logs? Yeah. That was fast. I saw two million yen has been paid into my account, so I checked out what it was for. Did you sell all of them? It doesn't matter, by the way, Naka... It matters! Did you give up your house? No. But, without logs, how... You can build a house without logs. I found free materials. Free materials? You know, it's hard to see what is under your nose. Naka, take a look from here over there. We were so used to see them so we never realized but there are piles of stones, here, there. Everywhere. Lands here are made of 40% of stone and 60% of soil. They separate stones from soil and left stones just there after they received compensation per 1 square meter. It's simply a waste of stones and lands. There's no reason we don't make use of them. I was blew away when I realized that. I'll build a house with stones, not with logs. Only with stones? Yes. The whole wall, too? Yes. How about the roof? For the roof, thinned-out trees of larch will work. Now that I've made a bath with stones, I'm convinced I can do it. But Naka, I'm so stupid. I made a bath but I'd forgotten about the water! I was planning to pull the water from the river. But there is no river nearby. So I went to the hill to check out, then I ran into a bear. What are you gonna do? I'll dig a well. What? A well? You see a lot of Doronoki (a kind of poplar) over there. It means there is water underneath. But it cost to dig a well. First of all, it cost 10,000 yen per meter for the boring. No. I dig it myself. You? My dad did it, too. 30 shaku (30.3 centimeters) must be sufficient. 30 shaku is almost 10 meters! Are you serious? Yeah. 10 meters is the height of a three-storied house! I konw. Ask a subcontractor. I'll lend you money. No, I'll do it myself. How can you? Are you nuts? I'll make it. Impossible. Naka. Do you know this song? ♪ It's now or never ♪ ♪ It's now or never ♪ ♪ The 66 year-old man's pet phrase is ♪ ♪ It's now or never ♪ Is that even a song? You don't know that? You are so behind. It's Tsuyoshi N..nakamizo. You can dig one shaku a day at most. It's not easy. I had no idea those things were happening. It was almost December in Tokyo. You could already find Christmas decorations everywhere around the town. It was such a day in the end of November that Toroko suddenly showed up. Are you already fine? Yes. I'm fine. I see. I was worried about you. About me? You must have been down. Yeah. Of course I was down. I couldn't even talk to you. I'm sorry. That's my line. This... What? I give you back. What? Haven't you heard of it? Your... Your father send it to us. There are 100 ten thousand-yen bills. in it. No, thank you. I can't accept them. Please return them to your father, saying we appreciated the thought. But... Keep it. But... Please take it away, it's being embarrassing. OK. I'm surprised. I wonder what it means. It's embarrassing that my dad did this kind of things. No, it's not. That is not the reason I gave back the money. My uncle told me to return it to him. "We accepted the apology, so let's forget what happened." That is his message. I didn't know that my uncle called my dad to come. I was so embarrassed that I cried. Because, I am already an adult, I... behaved... as one adult. So the responsibility lies in me. Doesn't' it? Yeah... Let's not talk about this. Jun. Will you go back to Hokkaido for the New Year? I also go back to Kagoshima next week. And, I won't come back here anymore. I've had enough of Tokyo. I graduate from Tokyo. It was fun... to be with you, Jun. I have no regret at all. ♪ There is someone ♪ ♪ In the wheat field ♪ ♪ Kissing with someone ♪ ♪ It's so nice ♪ ♪ Now I don't have a lover but ♪ ♪ Some day I'll also be with someone ♪ ♪ In the wheat field ♪ After that, we walked together a little. And I parted from Toroko. What she said right before was lingering in my head. I've had enough of Tokyo. I... graduate from Tokyo. Dad, how are you doing? I'm so sorry for making you worry. How did you make this amount of money? How... in Furano...all by yourself... Goro? Are you here? Who is it? Kogomi, from Komakusa! Kogomi! Wait a moment, I'm coming right now! Hello. It's been a while! Wow, wow, wow, wow. So you were alive. It's been quite a while. I wonder how many years it has been. I came back to Furano to live here again. Really!? I'll open a small bar in the Heso street. It opens on Christmas. I brought you an invitation. Here it is. Please come over for sure. I will! The bar is called Kogomi? Yes, I ended up choosing that name. Hey, hey. So you are still using this name like old days. You haven't changed, have you? Me? I've gotten old. I've gotten old, too. But you are still doing what you were doing. I'm so relieved to see that. I can't progress no matter how old I've gotten. I've heard about you from Nakahata and others that you are digging a well all by yourself. They were shocked by my stupidity, weren't they? At first, they often came here to discuss about the project. But now they gave up on me and no one comes over. Do you know Kinji Kano? The master carpenter! That's right! He is the only person who comes to see me every once in a while with that grimace on his face. I'm being treated like a weirdo. How far have you dug? About 6 meters. Any sign of water? I don't know. Not at all? For now. Last week, I came into a gigantic rock. So I cracked it little by little with a chisel. Fortunately, now I passed through the rock. But I worried so much. Hopefully, I want to finish this work within one month. I want to make it by the New Year's Eve. On New Year's Eve, my children will come back. That day...in the bath where you can stretch your legs entirely... Oh. Take a look at this! The bath is already finished. I haven't told about it to them. It'a secret. I wanna surprise them. On New Year's Eve. Here, in three, in the open-air bath... So exciting, isn't it? They must be blown away. I'm excited, too, everyday. What's wrong? Nothing. I almost cry. Why? I hope the water comes out. Yeah. The bar "Kogomi" in the Heso street opens today, on Christmas. We, at the bar "Kogomi", are having the opening ceremony for this occasion... Hokkaido is always behind because people are saying things like this! "Too much development"!? What are they saying? How can we get by here without land development! If only politicians get more subsidy, we'll have much more jobs here. Without jobs, how can you talk only about the protection of nature? Goro is late. Yeah. What's he doing? Deep in the hole, it's a total silence. You'll even lose the time perception. Kinji. Can we really leave him alone? He's doing it all by himself even without an assistant to bring up the soil. He's seriously losing his mind. Kogomi. Yeah, what do you want? I went to see him the other day. How was that? It's hard. I don't think water will come out. That's only natural. For an amateur like him, it's simply impossible. The other day, he was cracking a rock with a small chisel. It'll take him at least one year at that rate. It'll be fine if only the water comes out... What's he thinking...that idiot... I'm going. Are you? Are you staying? Are we going? Goro won't come. Sorry, Naka. It takes a little for a taxi to come. They are all out. Hello. What happened? We were all waiting you. It came out. The water. Right now. It came out. Hey, we thought you wouldn't come tonight any more. Came out. What? The water. It came out. Really? Ken! Bring me a bottle of champagne! The best one! Yes. Goro. Goro. ♪ It's now or never ♪ ♪ It's now or never ♪ All right, Akina, what time is it? What time is the flight of Jun? 12:20 at Asahikawa airport. Misue, please don't tell them about the bath. To neither of them. I must amaze them! I know, I know. ♪ It's now or never ♪ Kadomatsu (a New Year's decoration put on the entrance)! That's too bad, Akina. There is no New Year without any kadomatsu. Ouch! Oh, what time is it? It's time. Welcome home. I'm back. Welcome home. Ah... Welcome home. I think Hotaru will come back with the train of 4'o clock. Let's kill time in the town until that. I have some shopping to do as well. After we get Hotaru at the station, I have another thing to do. You remember about Dr. Zaitsu I told you before? The head of the clinic where she'll start working in the spring. Oh, yes. Let me pay him a visit just a bit. Then we go home, and you get rest. Meanwhile I... I can' tell you any more for now. What? I can't tell you. It's a secret now. Hey, what? Anyway, today is the warm New Year's Eve. The warm New Year's Eve. That's a clue. I can't tell you now. Dad, I have some. Here it is. I go tell him that Hotaru will come later to greet him. Hold it. It'll be better that Hotaru gives it to him herself. Hide yourself somewhere so he won't find out the salmon. Yes. All right, it's finished. Everything's finished this year. All we have to do now is to wait Hotaru. Have you been doing well? That's good. That's what is important. Everything's good as long as you are fine. Dad, Yeah? Can I talk to you a little before Hotaru comes back. What? I don't want you to get offended. What? This... Thank you. What? They gave this back to me. She contacted me in person. She said she could't accept this. Her uncle told her to do that, too. "Apology accepted, so let's forget what happened." That's his message to you. Thank you. I truly thank you. I talked with her. She said to me. We are both adults. We are about to have the coming-of-age celebration. So, we should take responsibility of what we did ourselves. So, though I can't express myself well, It's not you but me who should compensate. So, from now on, you don't have to take responsibility of these things I did. So... Thank you. I return it to you. I see. I understand what you said. Sorry if I sounded cocky to you. No. Yes. You are right. Yes. You are an adult now. Yes. I may have been out of line. Don't misunderstand me! I'm deeply grateful to you! I can never thank you enough... I know. I'm sorry. Why do you say sorry? You don't have to be sorry. But this... is the money I already gave you. I can't accept the money I gave up once. But, Dad! This large amount of money... Large amount it is! It's a huge amount for me. This is the money I earned sweating my guts out. But I already gave it to you. I want it back so badly. I could kill for that money. But I already gave it to you. As long as I gave up it once, I have a pride. Put it away, put it away! Before I steal it from you! That's fine. Yes. I would die for that money, but that's the right thing to do. I'm sorry. Jun. This money was important. I'm sorry. No, that's not what I mean. It wasn't important to have this money. What was important is to lose this money. Losing this money, I found a big thing. I remembered what I'd totally forgotten. If I had had money, it wouldn't have toured out this way. What do you mean? If you have money, you solve the problems with money. If you don't have money, you can relay only on your wisdom. On your wisdom and all the power you have. Jun, it's time. Hotaru is arriving! There she is. Hide. Welcome home. I'm back. Welcome home. Jun. How are you? I'm good. Let's hurry up! We can talk later. Dad. Let's go to pay a visit to Zaitsu clinic. Dr. Zaitsu is waiting for us. Oh, Give it to Dr. Zaitsu. This is the year-end gift for him. From you... Dad, I introduce him. This is Yuji Wakui. I'm Yuji. Oh. Hello. Oh, this is my brother. I'm Yuji. I'm Jun. Oh, that was what was going on. Wow, I had no idea... Would you like to come to our place? No, thank you. Dad, I need to tell you something. Oh, yeah? Of course. Tell me when we get home. Bur before that... I have to see someone now. So before that, I want to talk to you. It'll be fast, so let's enter some café. Hotaru, it can wait... It'll be fast. Hotaru, but today's... It's OK. Ok. then. Let's talk. But before that, let's go to... It'll be fast. I'm sorry. Please. I wanted to talk about where I start working in the spring. I'll go to Sapporo. I decided to work in a hospital in Sapporo. I really want to become a registered nurse. For that reason, I want to work in this hospital in Sapporo. The uncle of Yuji works there, so he arranged a job for me. So I'm going to live in Sapporo from the spring. I can't come back to Furano. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm the one... No! I asked him. I'll go to apologize to Dr. Zaitsu myself. I'll go there tomorrow for sure. I'm sorry. You don't have to do that. It's... what I arranged on my own. It's me. You don't have to worry. I'm sorry. What's wrong? Don't worry. You should do what you think is the best. That is the best. I... I'm glad for you. So, now you're going see his uncle? Akina! Don't bark! If you bark too much, I'm gonna turn you into meat. Goro, I brought you mochi! Oh, Jun! So you were alive! Hello, it's been a while. "It's been a while"? Don't put on airs like an adult. Oh, Goro. I bought you mochi. We made it this evening. What's wrong with you? Where is Hotaru? She's went to the town. Oh, I see. Do you wanna come to watch the Kohaku Music Festival? No, thank you. Oh, that's good. So I can pass the New Year's Eve with my mom, just the two of us. Then, have a Happy New Year. Jun, come over tomorrow with Hotaru. Yes. Then, Happy New Near! Let me use your car for a second. Where are you going? Just around the corner. I'll come back soon. I'll go to Sapporo. I can't come back to Furano. I'm sorry. The uncle of Yuji works there, so he arranged a work for me. So I'm going to live in Sapporo from the spring. I'll go to apologize to Dr. Zaitsu myself. I'll go there tomorrow for sure. I'm sorry. Dad... he is waiting. I'm coming now. Sorry. I'm sorry for holding her up. Dad? Are you home? Dad... Did he go somewhere? Why did you tell him something like that as soon as you arrived? I'm sorry. Did it really have to be today? The day in which the three of us meet first time in ages? Because I've been suffering from keeping it a secret. So, don't you come back to Furano any more? He was looking forward to your coming back. I know. When did you decide? In the end of November. Why didn't you tell him earlier? I couldn't. Because I was afraid to hurt him. Anyway, tell him sorry when he gets back. Where on earth did he go? Jun. What? Isn' he too late? Akina! Hello. Hello. Hello. Jun. Who is it? Sorry to bother you in the midnight. It's Jun Kuroita. Is my dad here? No, he isn't. I'm sorry. What happened? He went somewhere and doesn't come back. Isn't it strange? What time is it? It's already past three. Reiko? What will happen to me? Am I already done? Did I finish my responsibility with them? Not yet. Why? I keep doing things uninvited only to bother them... They want to take the responsibility for themselves. No. Why? Because they just left the nest. But... Soon they'll want to come back to the nest. Will they? But... both of them... Don't sleep. Protect the nest. Don't fall asleep and protect the nest. I'm not sleeping at all. I have tons of things I wanna tell you. I wanna tell you what happened after that. I have tons of... tons of... tons of... Don't sleep. Have you checked the hill? What hill? Akina! Goro. Goro! Goro! Go wake up Mr. Nakahata! Noooo! Dad! Noooo! No! You are a nurse-to-be, aren't you! What should we do in these cases? Dad, Dad! Dad, please wake up! No! Dad, no! Dad. Dad. Please live. Dad. Dad. Please. Please live, Dad. Yeah, yeah, past the noon, yesterday. Yeah, the blood pressure finally started to go up. They said he probably couldn't make it. No, the surgery is tomorrow. It should wait another day so he recovers. No, on the thigh and the shin. The knees were saved by a hair. For as long as nearly eight hours, he was being blown by the blizzard of −17‎°C without being able to move. Good work, so glad for your dad! I'm so glad! Sorry for causing you troubles. I'm so glad! You should give a feast to Akina, too! It was so tough, wasn't it? I'm so sorry. Sota came a short while ago and went to the hospital. He was flabbergasted, he didn't know about it. We are sorry for causing troubles to you all. Hey, have you gone to thank Kinji? No, we are going now. Go there immediately. It was thanks to him. Oh, hello. Jun, you had a hard time, didn't you? We are so sorry. My husband went to the hill where Goro always works. I am so glad he made it! Thank you very much. We owe him the life of my dad. Uncle, we deeply thank you. Thank you very much. We cannot thank you enough... Is the surgery tomorrow? Yes, but the doctor said it's not big of a deal. Anyway it was a miracle he survived. So said the doctor. If you hadn't come at night, he wouldn't have... The doctor also said his holding a dog favored the outcome. He wouldn't have made it without Akina, said he. He was fortunate because Akina went to the site. So he said. It's not true. It's not the case. It's not the fortune. It's not the dog, either. He... survived by himself. Look at this. Look here. With his legs trapped under the logs, he must have dragged the sheet from there, made a cover to protect himself from the blizzard and tried to make a fire. Look at this shovel. Because the ground is wet, probably on this shovel... Look, the shaft was chipped. He chipped it and tried to burn the shavings. He... lived by himself. Can youngsters like you do things like this? Can you? You two would have given up soon. You would have given up and been dead long. He is amazing. All by himself... I can't help but cry. He really makes me cry. Jun. I won't go to Sapporo. I'll be working at Zaitsu Clinic in Furano. Hotaru. You don't have to do that. You should go. You decided it. Jun. Hotaru. It may sound strange if I say this. But... as a man I think I know just a bit better than you how he feels. I bet his mind is already set. Even if you decide not to go to Sapporo and say that you'll stay in Furano after all, you'll only hurt his feelings. I think Dad... I think men... I've just recently started to realize that feeling pity for a man only hurts him. Pride or vanity or something like that always lies in men's heart. I've been wondering for long why an big adult sticks to such a worthless feeling... But I realized as long as you are a man, it stays in your heart the entire life. Besides, this thing is... to men... how can I put it... most precious and important. Go to Sapporo without saying anything. I'll tell him in a way that wouldn't hurt him. Count on me. Next is your turn. To tell the truth, I decided to come back to Furano. I've always been thinking about it. But the words of Uncle Kinji set my mind conclusively. I feel like I'm finally starting to see a purpose or a thing I can stake my life on though vaguely. That's how I'm feeling now. I'm no longer interested in Tokyo. From Tokyo, I already graduated. Count on me about Dad. I'll talk to him trying not to hurt his feelings. Jun? Yes. Why are you here? Why do those who are not supposed to be here come one after another even in my dream to make fun of me... Translated by kameu & kumasan for d-addicts
