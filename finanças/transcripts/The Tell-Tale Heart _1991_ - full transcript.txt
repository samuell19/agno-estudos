- [Man] Careful there Carey. - [Carey] Sorry sir. - [Man] We don't want to be moving anything until the boys have finished. - [Carey] No, sir. (gentle music) - True. Nervous. Very, very dreadfully nervous, I had been and am. How then am I mad? The disease had sharpened my senses, not destroyed, not dulled them. Above all was a sense of hearing, acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, can you say I am mad? Ha! Hearken! And observe how healthily, how calmly, I can tell you the whole story. - [Man] Gently there! You heard the sergeant. - It is impossible to say how, first the idea entered my brain but, once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object, there was none. Passion, there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold, I had no desire. I think it was his eye. Yes, it was this. He had the eye of a vulture, a pale, blue eye with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold. And, so, by degrees, very gradually, I made up my mind to take the life of the old man. And, thus, rid myself of the eye forever. Now this is the point, You fancy me mad. (laughs softly) Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded with what caution, with what foresight, with what dissimulation I went to work. I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it, oh, so gently. And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern all closed, closed that no light shown out and then I thrust in my head. Oh you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in. I moved it slowly, very, very slowly so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. (laughs softly) Would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well within the room, I undid the lantern cautiously. Oh so cautiously, cautiously for the hinges creaked. I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights. Every night, just at midnight. But, I found the eye always closed. And so, it was impossible to do the work. For it was not the old man who vexed me, but his evil eye. And every morning when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber and spoke couragiously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone. And enquring how he has passed the night. So you see, he would have been a very profound old man, indeed to suspect that every night, just at 12, I looked in upon him while he slept. Upon the eighth night, I was more that usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night did I feel the extent of my own powers, of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think, that there I was opening the door little by little, and he, not even to dream of my secret deeds and thoughts. (laughs softly) I fairly chuckled at the idea. And perhaps he heard me. For he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now, you may think that I drew back, but no. His room was black as pitch with thick darkness and so I knew that he could not see the door opening. And so, I kept pushing it on, steadily, steadily. I had my head in and was about to open the lantern when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out, "Who's there?" - Who's there? - I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour, I did not move a muscle. And in the meantime, I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in bed listening. Just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watchers in the wall. Presently, I heard a slight groan and I knew that it was a groan of mortal terror. It was not the groan of pain or of grief. Oh no, no. It was a low, stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I, I knew the sound well. Many a night, just before midnight when all the world slept, it has welled up in my own bosom, deepening with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. - Inspector. - I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt and I pitied him. I knew that he had been lying there awake ever since that first slight noise when he turned in the bed. His fears had been growing in upon him ever since. He'd been trying to fancy them causeless but could not. He had been saying to himself, "Oh, it's only the wind in the chimney. It's but a mouse, crossing the floor. Or, it is a cricket, which has made a single chirp." Oh yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions. But he had found all in vain. All in vain, because death, in approaching him, had stalked with his black shadow before him and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of this unperceived shadow that caused him to feel, although he neither saw nor heard, but to feel the presence of my head within the room. When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little, a very, very little crevice in the lantern, so I opened it. You cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily until at length, a simple dim ray, like the thread of a spider, shot out from the crevice and fell upon the vulture eye. It was open, wide open, and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness all a dull blue with a hideous veil over it. It chilled the very marrow in my bones but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person. For I had directed the ray, as if by instinct, precisely upon the damn spot. And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but an over-acuteness of the sense. And now I say, there came to my ears, a a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. (beating heart) It increased my fury as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage. But even yet, I refrained, stood still. Scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried as steadily as I could maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime, the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker and louder and louder every instant. The old man's terror must have been extreme. It grew louder, louder and louder and louder every moment! Do you mark me well that I have told you I am nervous? So I am. And now, at this dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. But even yet, I refrained for many moments and stood still. And yet, the beating of the heart grew louder and louder and louder yet! I thought it must burst, and then a new anxiety seized me. The sound would be heard by a neighbor. The old man's hour had come. (screams) With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern, I leapt into the room. He shrieked once, once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, I pulled the heavy bed down upon him. I smiled, I smiled gaily, having found the deed so far done. But for many moments, the heart, it beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me for I knew that it could not be heard through the wall and, at length, it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed, I examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my had upon the heart, held it there many moments. No pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more. Now, if you still think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe to you the wise precautions that I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, but I worked hastily, and in silence. First of all, I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs, and I took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber. And deposited all between the scantlings. Then I, I replaced all the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye, not even his could have detected anything wrong. There was nothing to wash out, no, no stain of any kind, no blood spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. (laughs softly) A tub had caught it all. (laughs softly) When I had made an end to these labors, it was 4 o'clock. Still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking, down at the street door. I, I went down, to open it, with a light heart. For what had I now to fear? (hums softly) (loud knocking) There entered three men, who introduced themselves with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night. Suspicion of foul play had been aroused. Information had been lodged at the police office and they, the officers, had been deputed to search the premises. I smiled, for what had I now to fear? I bade the gentleman welcome. "The shriek," I said, "was my own in a dream. The old man was absent, in the country." I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search, search well. I lead them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room. I desired them to sit here, and rest from their fatigues. While I, myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim. The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But ere long, I fancied myself getting pale and I wished them gone. My head, it ached and I fancied a ringing in my ears. Still, they sat, still chatted. The ringing became more distinct. It continued and, it became more distinct. I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling but it continued and gained definiteness. Until, at length, I, I found that the noise was not within my ears. No doubt I now grew very pale. I, I talked more fluently with a heightened voice. The, the sound increased. What could I do? It was a low, dull, and quick sound, such the sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly, more vehemently but the noise steadily increased. I arose, I argued about trifles in a high key and with violent gesticulations but the noise steadily increased! Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides as if excited to fury by the observations of these men. Yet the noise steadily increased! Oh God, what could I do? I foamed, I raved, I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting and grated it upon the boards but still the noise arose over all and continually increased! It grew louder, louder, louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly and smiled. Was it possible that they heard not? All mighty God, no. No, they heard. They knew, they suspected. They were making a mockery of my horror. This I thought, this I think. But anything was better than this agony. Anything was more tolerable that this derision. Any, I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer. I felt I must scream or die and now again, hark! Louder, louder, louder, louder! "Villains!" I shrieked, "Dissemble no more! I admit the deed! Here! Tear up the planks! Here, here! It is the beating of his hideous heart! (gentle music)
