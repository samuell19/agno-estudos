(uptempo techno music) - [Man] Our period of waiting is over. This is the time. (uptempo techno music) Our period of waiting is over. This is the time. Our period of waiting is over. This is the time. (electronic music) Our period of waiting is over. This is the time, this is the time, this is the time. This where we go. (upbeat techno music) (birds chirping) (gentle acoustic music) (Jazz flute) - [Clerk] Can I help you, sir? - Yeah, I'm looking for a camera to photograph wildlife, but I've never used one before. - Okay, I've got these two. Basically, you just point and shoot. - How do they differ? - Well this one's got a zoom lens on it. It gets you 10 times closer than this one, but it costs twice as much than this one. - I'll take them both. (gentle acoustic music) (camera clicking) (camera clicking) - [Richard Voiceover] I really want to meet her, but I don't know how to make an approach. What a chickenshit, madly in love and I haven't even enough guts to say hello. I don't even know her name. (gentle music and humming) (dark electronic music) - Hmm. You've got exactly the same goods as the young lady bought. Hmm. - I've only just become a vegetarian. I didn't know what to buy. (upbeat harpsichord music) - Ugh. (spitting) (upbeat harpsichord music) - [Richard Voiceover] Friday night. Leaves with flatmate, again. (upbeat harpsichord music) (laughing) (upbeat acoustic music) She is gorgeous. She is so gorgeous. Flat-mate's a bit of a dog, though. Did she hear that? She's looking at me. I've gotta find a way to talk to her. But she's there, though. Are they talking about me? Oh, shit. (door intercom buzzing) - Hello? Oh, hi, yeah. I mean, no. Come on up. - And you don't come out with your mates for a month. You don't answer the phone, you don't leave any messages, I've gotta come and look you down and you give me this shit. I mean, weird, strange shit. What's wrong with you? Just go up to her and say hello, give her some old bullshit. Take her to an expensive restaurant, seduce her, fuck her and forget her. - You just don't get it, do you? I can't help myself. I enjoy watching her more than anything else. If I met her, tried to talk to her, I'd just crease up inside and die. - Are you listening to yourself? Do you realize how weird you sound? - She's an angel. And I'm just a plain, boring, potbellied git with a receding hairline. - That didn't stop Jack Nicholson from becoming a sex symbol. Remember Brando in the Last Tango film, he was over twice your age. - They were film stars. In the real word, a mere mortal like me is invisible to an angel. Besides, I'm nearly 30. - What the hell happened to you? One minute, you're a carefree, young successful author. The next, you're Grandpoppy Quasimodo with delusions of becoming a reincarnated 15th century priest. With a little luck, any woman can be seduced. - Is that the best you can do? Take the piss out of me then tell me to rely on luck? Mate, friend, is that your best advice? Luck doesn't just happen. You've gotta be prepared, carefully designed. - My advice is take a long holiday or move flats. Better still, find out if anybody knows a good therapist and make an appointment. I'm in over my head on this one. I'm serious. Get some professional help. I'm worried about you, this isn't normal. I'll call you, we'll go out for a drink, okay? I'll see you. So that's it, you're just shutting us out? - Did you ever get the feeling that you were having a last conversation with someone that you were never going to see again? - You are seriously ill. And I don't need this shit. - [Richard Voiceover] She looks like a goddess. An angel. That's what I'll call her, Angel. - Ooh. Don't I know you? Haven't we met somewhere? - My name's Richard, how do you do? - I do okay, my name's Angelica. Now I remember you. You were that shy guy in the pub a few days ago that was staring at my mate. Then you disappeared. Pity, she fancied you. - She did? - Yeah, she likes the strong silent type, especially shy guys. Would you like to meet her? - No, I couldn't. - She's really nice. You can meet her in the pub on Friday night. I know she's not busy, and she's definitely not seeing each other, mm, anyone. - I'm not sure it'd be a good idea. - Please, she's as shy as you are. I've been trying to fix her up with a nice guy for ages. (soft jazz music) - I'm not sure if it'd be a good idea. - Go on, just come and meet her. I'll introduce you to each other. If you don't get on, there's nothing lost. (horn blowing) Please, for me? This is my train. Till Friday, then, seven o'clock. - [PA] Waterloo, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Shropshire, and Heathrow Airport.

It's so nice to meet such a polite and sweet guy nowadays. - Yeah, all the guys around here are like bulls on heat. - Can I get you some drinks? - Yeah, I'll have a pint of lager, thanks. - I'll have the same. - Excuse me? - Three pints of lager please. - To us. - Live young and die fast. - Here's to sex and plenty of it. - Yes, sex and plenty of it. (laughing) - What do you do then? - I write, science fiction. - Oh wicked, magazines, or comics? - Neither, novels, I've just had two novels published. - Wow, bet that pays well. - I do okay. - What do you do? - Well I'm-- - Angelica's a secretary, and I've just become assistant manager at King Chicken, Leicester Square branch. - Yeah, only because the old assistant manager kept on saying she'd been sexually assaulted by the owner. - You could take all your clothes off while dancing at the Christmas party, and then insist on the owner giving you a lift home, to talk about career prospects. Well. Alex! - Alex! - That's Alex, Angelica's boyfriend. He works in films. He's a cameraman. - Alex. - Richard. - Been working on a film in Manchester for the last two months, called, Drugs, Clubs, and Guts, and then managed to get away for the weekend twice. - Got in at 7:30, I don't have to be back till Monday, at seven. (giggling) Two more weeks and that's it. Finished. It's holiday time, baby. Around the world, we go. - Isn't that romantic? He's taking her on an around the world cruise as an engagement present. - So, what was it like filming a love scene between Chuck Riding and Jeanette Cummings? Is she really as beautiful in real life, as she is in the movies. - Body doubles. She even has a girl just for tits. - You all right, there? You look a bit off. - Just thinking of my parents. That's how they died, on a cruise. It was a storm. Two survivors. They said there were over 40 after it went down. Taken one by one. Sharks. - You poor thing. How old were you? - Four. - Oh baby. An orphan. - Um, can I get you a drink? Who fancies cocktails? - Yeah. - Long slow comfortable screws please. - You said you lived opposite us yeah? Whereabouts? - Just over there. - Oh wow, that's handy. You must be able to see in our living room window. Oh. Fancy inviting me up for a cup of coffee, then? - Yes, of course. (uptempo harpsichord music) (harpsichord music repeats continuing to speed up) (toilet flushing) - Do you like them? - Oh? - The walls. - They're mental. - Thank you. The flat used to belong to an artist, I just left the walls the way she had left them. - Must have been on serious drugs. Great place to trip and get stoned. - [Richard Voiceover] I've been playing the perfect gentleman, and tonight I've been invited to Ruth and Angelica's flat for the evening. - [Radio Voice] Good morning again, and here is Leslie Penis on Shite FM. Good morning, it's a fine and lovely morning, fine but cloudy. And we've got some (farting) (muffled by farts) Good morning, Jay Medner. - [Jay] Good morning Michael. - [Michael] Yes, here she is again. She's gonna give us some good fun. - Breakfast'll be two minutes babe. How do you want your eggs? Over easy, sunny side up? - Actually, over, well-done please. (pop music) - Mmm, wonderful, fresh coffee. Morning. - Morning. - There's a man at the breakfast table. Is he yours? - Poor little orphan, there's no one to look after him at home, so I brought him back here. Gave him a good seeing to. - [Man] Hello. - Shit, it's Monday. - [Man] I said, hello! (knocking on door) Can you hear me knocking? (knocking on door) Now come on now, you little monkeys. Let me in. Oh come on, I'm getting a little bit annoyed now. - A man walks up to a bar. A man walks up to a bar. A man walks up to a bar, and says, ouch. A man walks up, in to a bar, and says, ouch! What's the different between light and hard? You can sleep with a light on. Too crude. Nelson Mandela walks up to Woody Allen, at a bus stop I Belgravia, and asks, what time is the next bus due? Woody Allen says, Woody Allen would never say that. I know. - Invisible girl, special powers, eight. - Captain America, three. - Shit. You've got my galactus. Physical strength, nine, weapons, nine, beaten by crappy invisible girl. - The Gremlin. Weapons, seven. The wasp, none. - I don't bloody believe it, Silver Surfer, strength, nine, powers, 10, weapons, sodding five, bloody shit. That's it, I'm not playing anymore. The two best damn cards in the whole game, and I've lost them both, one after the other. - [Ruth] We set you up. We looked at your cards when you went for wee. - I'd persuade Ruth to stay in, saying it's not fair to leave Angelica on her own all the time just because we're dating. Angelica's boyfriend is only here at the weekends. What do I get for my consideration? Conspiracy. - There there, poor baby. I know, why don't you tell Angelica some of your jokes? - I don't want to. - Oh, go on Richard, please. - One vampire bat flies up and lands on a branch next to his mate. His friend, seeing his other friend's face is covered in blood, says, I'm hungry, where's the feast? The other bat turns and says, See that tree over there, indicating with one furry wing, and the other bat nods eagerly. And his mate continues, well I didn't. Mister Nelson Mandela walks up to Woody Allen at a bus stop in Belgravia, and asks, what time is the next bus due? And Woody Allen says, suck off you black bar steward. What time is the next bus due? Due. - Morning, baby. Hello. I'm off now, babe. Angelica's already left for work, so let yourself out. (masturbating and grunting) - [Richard Voiceover] I love you my sexy pussycat. My love and kisses, Alex. - So it's A, B, C, D, and E, and an inch for each. - You boys. The initial figure is found by placing a measuring tape around you back, and underneath the breast. Then take another measurement around your boobs, and subtract the original figure. The difference is an inch, an A cup, two inches, a B, three inches, C, four inches, D, and five, is double-D. - Whoa whoa whoa whoa, wait. What happened to E? - There is no E. - There is no E. - And after that, I don't know. I think you should find out. - See, nothing. - It doesn't work if you don't take it seriously. - This sort of shit only happens in the movies. - Yeah, when all the characters are locked into a creepy only mansion for the weekend, with no way out. - And it's always dark, with a gigantic thunderstorm. - Not always. An old girlfriend told me a story once, and swore it was true. The scariest story I ever heard in my life. (hiccuping) Imogen, my ex-girlfriend was 15. She was left one afternoon to look after her older, heavily pregnant sister. Her parents were just leaving to visit their third and youngest child. Imogen's sister was deaf, dumb, never left the house, and yet had incredibly, become pregnant. Almost seconds after her parents had walked out the door and driven off, Imogen heard screams coming from her sister's bedroom upstairs. Not her sister's voice, it seemed like several other voices, both male and female. Although she was terrified, in fear for her sister, Imogen overcame her own fear, and ran up the stairs. (confused voices) Imogen's mother and father were arrested. Supposedly they were devil worshipers. Imogen was put into psychiatric care. She never saw her younger brother or sister again. (hiccuping) - Funny, hearing a scary story punctuated by hiccups. - When I was a child, I had hiccups for three days. I remember a nurse slapping me repeatedly, and telling me to calm down and stop. A doctor gave several extremely painful lumbar puncture injections in my spine, and he was telling the nurse that it probably wouldn't have any effect. Luckily I came out of it. Something to do with swallowing my own sick and choking on it whilst falling unconscious. I heard of this boy that had hiccups for three whole years, and he died hiccuping. So don't laugh, and say it's funny to laugh, at people who are hiccuping. - Enough. - 'Cause it can kill you. - Enough, already. Okay, I swear I'll never laugh at anyone with the hiccups again. You've convinced me, I swear. - So funny. You should be onstage. - Have your own TV show, Mister Hiccups. (laughing) (thunder rumbling) - [Richard Voiceover] Gotta get rid of that bastard. I'll kill him how he talks. Just by knowing him I'll be a suspect. They'll know I did it. - [Richard Voiceover] Accident. I'd run the son-of-a-bitch over, by a big, powerful car. Keep it in the lockup, and when the time is right, I'll run him over. Squash his shaging head. - One woman is my destiny. Then he woke up. Isn't it poetic? And romantic - I know, let's go down to the pub for a couple of pints over football. It'll give us a chance to get to know each other. Look, tell the girls we'll meet them after, yeah? - All right. - Evil. - Let's go now. Going down the pub. (people talking loudly) - Get them in, I'm just going for a piss. Watch it, mate. - Hey, do you know that guy there? - Alright guys. Just got out this morning after doing four years, Brixton. Come home, visit my mother. Found out she died, yesterday. Comin' in, nearest pub, a few pints to drown my sorrows. Lo and behold, spot the copper from the drugstore that sent me up. Found 50 E's on me. The guy you bumped into. I'll give you 20 quid each, if you beat the shit out of him. 'Cause I'm out on parole. - I fucking hate the DS, but it's your life. You're shit. Now if you want us to join your party, to beat the fucking shit out of that guy, it'll cost you 40 quid each, in advance. - You never know? - He could be some Van Damme mother, for all I know. - Police please. Yeah, there's a gang of thugs beatin' up my mate . in the 100 pub Yes, Richard Wells, 116 Ainsley Street. Please hurry. (siren blaring) (uptempo electronic music) Quickly thinking to find the police, I rushed down High Street until I found a phone that worked. Then I rushed back to the pub but, too late. If only I'd known they were actually beating him up. I thought they were just hooligans, just tearing the pub up. - To tell you the truth, I think you saved his life. If the police hadn't have come along when they did, he could have been seriously hurt. Thank you. - Hey, you're a hero, baby. You saved Alex from, I don't even want to think about it. (car starting) (eerie electronic music) (engine revving) (screaming) - Another beer. (soft jazz music) - I want the bastard to suffer. I'm not giving you 500 just to get rid of him. I want him to suffer. (fast-paced techno music) (grunting) - You ain't wearing a wire, and you're too stupid even to be a pig, what the fuck do you want? - I heard you talking in the bar. I want you to kill somebody for me. - I don't know you from Adam. Yet you think you know me well enough to kill for you? - I don't want to know you, or anything about you, and I'm not asking. I'm offering you, 500 pounds, if you could do a job for me. - Walk away. Walk away. - Please, I'm serious. I really need your help. - Walk away, now! - Please, I beg you. God! - Walk away, now. - Please, I beg you. God. - Walk away now, or die. - Please, please, I'm desperate. If you won't help me then, pull the trigger. - You got money? - Yeah. - Well, buy me a drink. Let's talk. - Yeah.

There's enough for two. There you are. Some wine. You want cake? We have cake. (Ruth crying) - Aren't you going to blow out the candles? Did you make a wish? - I wish that I could have my cake, and eat it. - Dumbo doesn't want anything. (laughing) - Dumbo already has her mouth full. To Dumbo, such a short life, but oh, loads of kicks. - Drink and be merry, for tomorrow she-- (laughing) - Now where did I leave my camera? (Ruth whimpering) Tomorrow night, then? - I've been thinking, you want it done tomorrow, it costs you double. - Why? - I may want to kill some other guy tomorrow night. Besides, if you want me to do the other stuff, it's double. - Okay, a thousand. I'm sure she said seven o'clock. It's just not like her. - She probably suspected that she might be late. That's why she suggested meeting here. Anyway, it's Friday night. Let's have a drink while we're waiting. (tense electronic music) - Bitch, stupid bitch. (screaming) I guess you know by now. I'm gonna kill you! But how you die, could be short and painless, eh Or involve a lot of nasty torture. Your boyfriend paid me extra to wait until tonight before raping and killing you. I think he's got the horn for your skinny flat-mate. (screaming) Don't you dare touch Angelica (muffled whimpering) Wouldn't want to. I like my women more full-figured. Soft, not all skin and bones. - Something's happened to Ruth. Don't ask me how I know but... - Tart! (doorbell buzzing) - Angelica... - Hello? Yeah. - I'm Detective Barnes, this is Detective Watts. We'd like to ask you a few questions. - What's this about? - Do you know Ruth Longsdale? - Yeah, she's my girlfriend, she-- - Where were you last night between hours of 11 p.m. and one a.m.? - I was here all yesterday evening, waiting for Ruth to meet me here. - All evening? - Yes, all evening. We waited all evening for her. We even fell asleep on the sofa, waiting. - I'm sorry to inform you that Ruth has been found on the side of a country road. She'd been raped, and stabbed in the back. - Angelica? (gagging) - Something's not quite right. He looked mighty guilty all of a sudden. - He was there all night, so he could hardly have done in Longsdale. Looks to me as if he was banging her flat-mate while Longsdale was being done.

Go on. - This might sound a bit crazy but, why should I be alone over here, and you're alone over there with some terrible murdering rapist on the prowl. - Are suggesting moving in together? - Just as flat-mates. - That'd would be lovely. Yeah, I'd like that very much. I could do with a friend being near. - Friends. (soft vocal music) (uptempo instrumental music) - [Richard Voiceover] Two weeks since Angelica moved in. I think I've waited long enough. Time to get what's mine. - When was this taken? What's going on? - It was taken on a timer. It was the night before Ruth disappeared. We were so happy, we were just mucking about and being silly. You can see how happy she was, we were almost crying with laughter. It was the last picture of Ruth, before, she was murdered. (dark orchestral music) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Man] Hello, Angelica? Is Richard there? - How do you know my name? - [Hit Man] Richard introduced me to you're flatmate once. You told me on the back end. Is Richard there? - I'll get him, hold on. - Hello? - [Hit Man] There'll be a map in your post tomorrow, with a meeting point marked on it. I'm clearing out the country, and I want 20,000 pounds from you tomorrow night at two a.m. Or I'll have to meet Angelica. Have a little chat, maybe take her for a ride. - Okay. - Who was that? - Just my agent. - Beautiful, isn't it? I like it here. I used to take acid and come here when I was a kid. Sit for hours and admire the view. Changed a bit since then You know really, we're very similar people. Both ruthless when it comes to getting what we want. We're not lettin' anybody get in our way. In fact, under different circumstances we may have been friends. (gun firing) Got me partner. Didn't know you had it in you. - I never had any reservations about killing anyone. I just didn't want to be connected to any murder. Now, I don't need an alibi, because no one knows we know each other. We're as unconnected as strangers on a train. - You know, I always dreamt of being able to travel in time. If I finally figured it out, I was going togo back and give my eight-month pregnant mother a good kicking, at least enough to make her abort me. - Well, I'll save you the trouble. You know, I was shocked, really shocked, to find you can buy a gun in a bar for 200 pounds, costs 500 to have someone killed, and only 200 pounds to buy a loaded gun. I'm economizing. (gun firing) (tense electronic music) (uptempo techno music) - [Woman] Going to Paris for the fashion shows. Sorry to miss you, darling. Love, Mary-France. (crowd chatting) (uptempo techno music) - [Richard Voiceover] Come on (muffled speaking). Shit! Somewhere in all this crap. Oh, yes! (uptempo techno music) (east Indian vocal music) (uptempo techno music) (eerie electronic music) - Round the world cruise tickets. - I've got something important to ask you. Please sit down. We both suffered terrible loss. I think we should start afresh, start enjoying life again. Angelica, will you join me on a round-the-world cruise? - Acapulco, Bali, Cape Town, Honolulu, Mauritius, Singapore, Saint Lucia, Sydney. - Will you make me the luckiest man alive, and marry me? - I'd love to. (eerie electronic music)
