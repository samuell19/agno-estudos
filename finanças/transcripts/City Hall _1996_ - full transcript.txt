New york city-- So many things Have been said about it, But there's only one I really like. New york-- It can destroy you Or fulfill you, Depending a good deal On luck. No one should come To new york Unless he's willing To be lucky, And I got lucky. I had an apartment Downtown, But home was city hall. That's where it all began. The day started out Like a lot of other days, With some ceremonial Function. The mayor of new york was Giving the key to the city To the governor of tokyo. ...and In the japanese tradition, He liked soup For breakfast-- Fish soup. Well, my dad, Hearing of this, Offered to put it On the menu. But, "no, no, no, no, no," Mr. Hiyatama said-- Who is a very gentle soul, By the way. "No. It would be Too much trouble." My dad replied, "too much trouble Is no customers." The mayor-- And he was the best mayor The city ever had-- Was my boss, And I was his deputy mayor-- His right-hand man-- Or his boy, Depending on Who was talking about me. But in brooklyn, Something else was going on That was going to change Everything. Hey, how you doing, Eddie? It started with a cop-- Eddie santos-- The toughest detective In brooklyn north. He was on his way to a meeting With tino zapatti, A small-time drug dealer Whose only distinction Was that he was nephew To paul zapatti, A mafia boss. All right, There you go. James bone, a child On his way to school... Watch your step here. And finally, vinnie zapatti, Cousin to tino-- A rat detective eddie santos Had in his pocket. All set? Let's go. It all happened On the corner of broadway And marcy in north brooklyn. Boy, you ain't going out On no playground today. Please, daddy, please. No. It's raining Too hard. Oh, man. Here comes our boy. Get out Of the fucking car. You said you wanted To fucking take him in. I just want to have A little talk with him. Hey... You turn him Away from me. Keep up with me, now. Come on. I thought you could Move faster than that. Come on. Yo, tino. Hey, how you doing? All right. Tell me, What's going on? Listen, I got some really good news. What the fuck Is wrong with you, man? Hey, tino. Oh! 2 men Dedicated to their lives And their families... Kevin. Bridging the continents Of asia And southern europe... Can it wait? No, no. Right now, please. 2 men Crossing 2 continents To meet in a third, As we have here today-- The governor of tokyo And the mayor of new york. Welcome to new york city, The sushi capital Of the world. Welcome. Enjoy. Sayonara. We got a serious Situation. Kid's dead. So's the dealer. And the cop? Not good. Whose bullet was it Killed the child? We don't know yet. What's our e.t.a.? Bellevue in 10, Sir. How old was the little-- What was it, a boy? 6 years old. And... What was our budget As of midnight? 31.7 billion. It costs a lot of money To have our children Slaughtered in the streets. Yeah. Hello, Mr. Mayor. Coming through. Step back, please. Step back. Coming through. Mr. Mayor. How's he doing? He's just come out Of surgery. Coming through. Give them room. Get back. All the way, now. Where's the widow, Jerry? She's not a widow yet, Mr. Deputy. Go introduce me. Ok? Combat cross, Medal for merit, Honorable mention, Department Medal of honor. Any kids? 2--5 and 3. A boy and a girl. Wife's name is elaine-- Elaine santos. Which one is she? Don't point. In the red. The other's her sister. Mrs. Santos? I'm john pappas. I'm so sorry. Thank you. If there's anything We can do... Whatever... Which one Was the shooter? They're both shooters, Mr. Deputy mayor. One's dead. One's almost. Now, we know The dealer--tino zapatti. Zapatti? He was paul's nephew. Punk. What happened? We don't know yet. Detective santos Was signed out. That, we know. But he carried No radio, Wore no vest. Any backup? Zero. Total breach of Department policy. What was the guy doing? Taking a meeting with A convicted drug dealer? You got me. But it adds up To a dead kid And a dead nephew Of the head Of the zapatti family. Here's a guy headed for Attica on a 10 to 20, And he cops probation. Probation? No jail time? Probation is a sentence in New york these days, isn't it? Which he skips out on 2 years later. We've been Looking for him ever since. The mayor's going to want To step up for the wife. I wouldn't do that If I were him. And who are you again? Internal affairs. Listen... We can bury santos, And if it turns out He was dirty, Well, good cop Turns bad. Happens all the time. Sure. We'll give him A full dress funeral to boot. Was he conscious? I'm going back inside. Who is she? That's one Of the lawyers For the detectives Endowment association. I guess she'll be Representing Eddie santos And his family. Yeah? Well, I always wondered when You were going to ask. Well, now you don't have To wonder anymore. Stop. Shock him. Clear. He's flat. This city takes care Of its own. Set a press Conference for 12:00. Make sure the post Takes the first question. You know what the first Question's going to be? "Whose bullet was it?" Call senator marquand. Be cool. Tell him Everything's under control, And of course the mayor Is on with him tonight. I'm just trying to stay Ahead of the curve here. Yes. And, abe, call leonard Street and get a copy Of tino zapatti's Probation report. Which zapatti is that? A nephew-- One conviction. He got off on probation. He's a punk. We're headed for park Drive--downtown in 20. How's about We swing over to the f.d.r.? We'll make better time. Sir, what's Your pleasure? Where did the boy live? Rainbow one, Rainbow two, Give me a read On the boy's apartment. 515 south fifth street. Fifth street, just off Marcy and broadway. Ok. That's where We're gonna go. We've got no advance man. We've got no protection. It's ok, kevin. That's where we're going. I'm the mayor. All right, Make room here, please. Here you go, mayor. Mayor, we need Some help around here. We need some More police on the street. When are you going To send us some help, man? Mr. Mayor. Glad You're here, mr. Mayor. The father's seated In the corner. Yes, yes. I'm all yours, leslie. Questions and answers. Let's hear it. Who's up? The post. Marks or sadler? Sadler. Ohh! Then I know What's coming. "Has probation become A sentence in this town?" Judge stern has a powerful Record on the bench. He's served 6 years And meted out The stiffest punishments In the history Of this city. If the report Recommends probation, Then probation It has to be. After that, they'll start in On the mandatory crap. Gotcha. Picture, mayor? Sir, over here? Thank you. Sir? Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks... Ahem. Good morning. I would like to welcome The reverends Williams and birch... You got that Probation report? It's in the office. He'll be there In a minute. Let's go. And my dear friend Reverend milton parks Of the first church Of harlem, Reverend chapman, And reverend murray. Thank you, gentlemen, For coming here today. I know it wasn't easy For you. Well, what can I say? How do I start this? Uh... There is one thing As mayor That I will never Get over... And that is the death Of a police officer. There is one thing in life That I will never get over, And that is the death Of an innocent child. But this is an incident That will not go away... Tino zapatti's Probation report. Is that it? The whole city, All parts Of the city-- Bushwick, jamaica, Washington heights, Brownsville, Harlem-- The bodies drop... This thing looks ok. It's very ok. But, look, there is A conviction-- Criminal possession In the fourth degree. In the fourth degree? A 4-c. It's a probation offense. It's practically A misdemeanor. Kevin, there are 4-cs. Then there are 4-cs. Or some dark alley In williamsburg. You keep looking at that thing As if it weren't kosher. A cut of meat is kosher. A piece of fish, Savory foods, And all kinds Of dainties are kosher, But a probation report Is not kosher. A probation report is Merely a probation report. I am a good louisiana Lapsed catholic, abe, So just don't talk to me About kosher. Just give it to me straight. What's wrong With this report? It's too kosher. Translate that for me. Uh... The virgin Looks pregnant to me. Look. You see? The supervisor signed this. So what? That's a lot of weight For a 4-c. So what happened To the original little Probation officer? Where is his signature? Who is this supervisor? Do you know him? Yeah. His name is schwartz. Schwartz? A landsman of yours? Landsman. Landsman. Stop trying your yiddish Out on me. You sound like A shakespearean actor From a savannah pogrom. All right, all right, But do you know him? Yeah, sure, but the trial Was almost 2 years ago. I was long gone From the department. Yes? Hello, larry. Abe. Good to see you. Good to see you. This is Deputy mayor calhoun. The first deputy mayor To set foot on this floor. We got A commissioner once, But it was The wrong floor. May I have a seat? Please, sit. Abe, you're already At home here. Thank you. I think I know Why you're here. I've logged 12 calls Already today. Tino zapatti? Yes. And you want to know Why I handled the case? Exactly. Because sometimes We get overloaded. And you take on The extras. The extra specials. Such as... Zapatti family members? Something like that. Look, mr. Deputy mayor-- Kevin's good enough. Any case That comes in here That looks like It's connected, I'm gonna take a very Special interest in. Why is that? To avoid Making mistakes. You sure made one On this. I blew one, ok? I--i don't mind Admitting it, But just let me Tell you something. I'd rather blow One in a hundred Than send 10 men away On mandatories Who don't deserve them. You sound like an Enlightened man, mr. Schwartz. And you sound like You're fucking with me. You have anything To add here, abe? That's ok, larry. You're doing fine. Everybody's gonna want to Know how these things happen. How long have you Been on this job? 3 years. Look, These things happen Because We are awash here In criminals and Half-baked social workers In a city That doesn't function In a world that doesn't Know right from wrong. Mr. Schwartz... Larry. I owe you an apology. No. No apologies. I came in here With a big head of steam, And perhaps It was inappropriate. Look, it takes More than 3 years To get up to speed In this department. There's only one man Who would've made A good probation officer-- Kafka--and he wasn't Available. Thank you, larry. Hey, give me a call If something opens up In that big building. You know, Keep me in mind. He'll be right With you. South brooklyn Democratic club. Oh, yes. Yes, yes. How are you? I don't think it makes Any difference whatsoever. Just have your son Stop by this evening. I'll be happy to take Care of this problem. Gussie, come on in. Oh, hello, mr. Anselmo. Thank you so much For seeing me. You look Beautiful. Oh, thanks a lot. Let me get that. Oh, ok, Ok. Come on. Thanks. It's my pleasure. So, how can i Help you, gussie? They're going to throw Me out, mr. Anselmo. Who? Morty brill. No one's gonna Throw you out, gussie. He says I'm underoccupied. Can I help it if My daughter moves out? Isn't she entitled To a life of her own? Of course. How is elaine? Still working At the navy yard? Yeah, thanks to you. So, what can you do For me, mr. Anselmo? Well, it's simple. Just see that mr. Brill Obeys the law. You're grandfathered in Over there. If he tells you you're not, Just give me a call. See, a curvy landlord Like morty brill Is always looking for Ways around rent control, But how would He understand a law That was meant For working stiffs Like you and me? Thanks, mr. Anselmo. Excuse me. Mr. Schwartz Is right outside. Thanks, clara. Mr. Anselmo? Mr. Anselmo? Yes. Would you like to come Speak to my club? Which club is that? Terrible tiles Mah-jongg club. How many tiles belong? 112. You got it, sweetheart. Just tell me when. Fantastic. So you'll Come for dinner before? What are you making? I'll make a brisket. It's your favorite. I love brisket. Go home safe. Yeah, well, I'm taking a cab, anyway, But thanks again. Ok. Aw, shit. Hello, larry. I gotta see you, frank. Well, here I am. How about a cup of coffee? No, thanks. Um... We gotta talk. I'm sorry. Are you Finished here? I... Well, the business Of government, larry, Is never finished. Come on. Let's take a walk. Mr. A. How are you, milton? * I'm as corny * * as kansas in august * * i'm as normal * * as blueberry pie * * no more a smart little Girl with no heart * * I have found me A wonderful guy * You know, speaking of Blueberry pies, Bring us a couple, Milt. Uh, you a la mode? No, thank you. I don't want any pie. Apple for him. And coffee, milt. What's the matter? You know what The matter is, frank. You look terrible. You ought to take a vacation. I don't want a vacation. I got 18 years in, You know? I save up my time. I put in my hours. I'm eligible for pension In 6 months. I don't want Any goddamn vacation. Ok. So what is it? Get the deputy mayor Off my ass. Ha ha. Shrimp boats? Him. Yeah. And you couldn't Handle him? It was easy. That's what i'm saying. It was too easy. * Don't throw * * bouquets at me * * don't please * * my folks too much * * don't laugh * * at my jokes too much * * people will say * * we're in love * What the hell was that? Well, milt and I are great Rodgers and hammerstein fans. When you walk Through a storm, Keep your head Up high, larry. It's not your signature On the probation report. Then watch your mouth. That was Quite a risk you took. The guy was wrong. But no mayor-- I don't care If he is from new york-- Tells off a cabinet Member like that. He's your enemy For life. The secretary Of urban development, That's the hand That feeds the cities. Well, you know, senator, They say a man's stature Is determined by his Enemies, not his friends. It also got you The cover of time. That's true. But going national, Mayor pappas? People magazine next. That stature thing. Who said that? I believe I said that A minute ago. I was having an acute attack Of self-importance. But now it's about To come to an end, Because here's the man To cut me down to size. Kevin, we missed you. Sorry, folks. Didn't Mean to interrupt you. Hello, senator. Kevin's been busy Today, i'll bet. This must be Mrs. Marquand. It's been quite a day For you, hasn't it? Indeed. We don't want Any stray bullets Around Madison square garden. Ignore the senator, kevin. He likes to keep a little Anchored to windward. Don't we all? But in the meantime, Shouldn't we return To the burning issue Of the day, the convention? We're gonna turn the city Upside down for you, sir. We're gonna stage the right Kind of convention. What kind is that? The kind that's going to get The president reelected. Where you going to go? Second cities like chicago, Always resonating with Memories of hubert in '68? California? Still the land of Jerry brown and tom hayden-- The sort of place that Nominates a walter mondale. You could go to miami, But miami's casablanca. We'll make you a winner. We got the city right here. You're not a new yorker, Are you, kevin? Ferriday, louisiana-- Huey long country. Every man a king, But no one wears a crown. Ha ha! I love this guy. Thank you so much. Don't overdo it. Great To see you. Great to see you. Good night. Hey, kevin, give me A call in the morning. I need some stuff For the new york times-- An editorial lauding Our choice of convention city. The president loves A good times editorial. You got it, senator. Let me just assure you-- The vote's in, kevin. We got the convention. Now let these people Catch their shuttle. I'm sure they're Running late. Thank you, mr. Mayor. Thank you so much, Senator. Macneil-lehrer, Friday night. Tino zapatti's bullet Killed the child. It wasn't the cop. That's it? That's what passes For good news these days? Well, I'll sure take it. And I saw tino zapatti's Probation report-- Exemplary, But an odd thing. What? It's front-loaded. With who? With supervisory Personnel, But it's signed off on By an honest judge, so... Judge walter stern? Yes. Thank god. I'm meeting Frank anselmo For breakfast. Oh, good. Where? Werner's. Werner's? The hangout At borough hall? That's it. Kevin, when you go To brooklyn, You're Frank anselmo's guest. Don't piss up his leg. Just get him off this Infrastructure thing. Nothing wrong with it. Just unaffordable Right now. Good work tonight. Mrs. Marquand couldn't Stop talking about The cover Of time, could she? I think She collects them. National ink-- The mother's milk of politics. So, did I hear right, Or did we get the convention? It's not signed And sealed, But it is delivered, And you were the closer. Well, I thought I had them With that second city stuff. Of course you did. You know why? It belongs here. New york city-- This is the place. Excuse me. The story's coming up On the 10:00 news. A little slow. ...earlier today Took the life Of an innocent 6-year-old boy Who was on his way To school During an apparent Police action. Police Detective eddie santos... They're all over it Like a cheap suit. It's gonna stick To us like one, too. 6-year-old James bone On his way to school. Ballistics from The police lab now confirm The wayward bullet That killed the young boy Came from zapatti's gun. Meanwhile, Police here at the scene Continue to investigate. Here you are, mr. Zapatti. Michael. Find vinnie. I want to have A little talk with him. Yesterday, On the corner of broadway And marcy street, Gunfire suddenly broke out, Claiming 6-year-old James bone, Along with 21-year-old Tino zapatti, A convicted felon On probation, And a 32-year-old Police detective, Eddie santos. The police commissioner Has disclosed That an investigation Is under way Into detective santos' Activities. Question-- What was santos doing With a convicted Drug dealer Wanted for probation Violations? Now turning To new york's weather... Good morning. ...will raise Serious questions Of corruption In the courts. Stern gave tino zapatti, A drug dealer, Probation instead of Sending him to prison, And the question Everyone is asking, Because of this unusual Disposition, Is why did the judge Do that? There are other City officials Who are being Interrogated. Hello. Hello. Good morning, mrs. Santos. I'm marybeth cogan. We met at the hospital. Yeah. Hello. And that's Randy and maria there? Yeah. These are my kids. Ms. Cogan? Please. You sit down. I'm sorry to have To talk to you here. That's all right. You hear from anyone In the department today? A couple of the guys. Yeah? What did they say? I called to pick up his Things from the precinct. They told me His locker was sealed. But the captain Came to see me. He was very nice. W-what captain? Homicide south. That's eddie's commander. He's required To pay a call on the widow. Is anything wrong? Don't talk to anyone without Checking with me first. Ok? Ok. A slight Exaggeration. We're in The wrong business. Hey, you get lost, kid? Somewhere there's a key To downtown brooklyn, But I sure don't have it. Murray, lenny, You know kevin. Kevin, this is dan. Kevin calhoun. How you doing? Tex, sit down. Take a load off your feet. Louisiana, murray, For the umpteenth time. Hey, what's the matter? You can't take a joke? Jimmy. What'll you have? I'll have some oatmeal With skim milk, Sliced bananas, a little Brown sugar, please. So, what's new, kevin? I'll give you The headlines. Standard & poor is going to Lower the city's credit rating. We're going to close 2 firehouses in the bronx. Results--150 demonstrators In front of city hall. The deputy Park commissioner has quit To run The san francisco ballet, And the stock exchange insists They're leaving town, Plus a zillion other Little rancid goodies. Plus a kid got shot. By another drug dealer. And a cop. Yeah. So no wonder the deputy Mayor's joining us In brooklyn today. Well, but He's very welcome. On the stock exchange, Where are they removing to, Kevin, my boy? White plains, They might. They've been muttering That for years. One of these days, They're gonna Stop muttering and go. That's why we need city land For bank exchange. No argument, Lenny. And a subway stop And an off-ramp From the brooklyn-queens Expressway. The city's $25 billion In debt, frank. We're in no position To build subway stops And off-ramps. Ha. 3,000 workers, You don't even want To build them A subway stop? What's your interest In this, lenny? Did you happen to buy A few options Around the city Property? Of course he did, And so did every other Developer in town. Not withstanding that, Mr. Deputy mayor, If you don't find a way to Transport their employees, Bank exchange Is gonna dump this deal And forget about new york And put up Their 60-story building In new jersey Instead of brooklyn. So be it. The mayor loves Bank exchange, frank, But he can't afford Infrastructure. You know, For a good old boy, You're sure flying in The face of real politics. Subways get people to jobs. Jobs mean votes. I thought john pappas Liked votes. He loves votes, Frank... Ah. But no infrastructure, Unless the city Approves of the idea Of a subway station And an off-ramp It can't pay for it. Where you going? I have an appointment In manhattan. This meeting's over? I heard you say no. Can I offer you a ride? No, thanks. I'd make it quicker On the train. Here he comes. Judge stern! Judge stern! Over here, sir. What did you Give tino zapatti Probation for, Your honor? Why did you go soft On the drug charge? Is probation a sentence In this town, judge? Your honor, they're Burying little james bone. Are you going To the funeral? Over here, judge stern. Could we get a statement From you, please? Get me the file On tino zapatti. How are you? You, too. Hi. Mr. Deputy mayor. I'm marybeth cogan. "Detectives endowment Association, Legal affairs Co-counsel." Very nice card. I represent detective Eddie santos, And you're muddying My client's name. Take up the matter With corporation counsel. What, and get it buried? No, thank you. Aren't you supposed to be The pipeline to the mayor? You should tell him somebody's Taking him up the wrong street. This is all Very interesting. Maybe we could explore It in more detail, Maybe over some coffee Or something. I'm talking about A hero detective And his widow's pension. Why don't you wait In my office. I won't be But a few minutes. No, I don't think so. You have my card. I'll expect to hear from you In the morning. No, no, no, no. Wrong. Nothing's gonna go away Unless you Do something about it. This is a crisis That could derail us-- The way willie horton Sunk dukakis. Tino zapatti Can sink us. Good afternoon. Where you been? My brooklyn meeting. Oh. How'd it go? I think I just pissed up Frank anselmo's leg. And? It felt good. Ok, leslie. Right. Tomorrow's Times, post, and news Are all keeping the shooting At broadway and marcy On the front page. What'd you expect? Nothing short Of a triple ax murder Is gonna take it off. Let's just keep feeding The press morning and night. Emphasize The administration's Tough stand on crime. We had a 20 % drop In homicides And street crime Last year alone. Also, stern's record-- Hard-line. Good, kevin. Corporation counsel? Well, we've commissioned A comparative study That will prove That this city Has the toughest probation Guidelines in the country. Excellent. Kevin, get Community affairs involved. Tell parks clean up Their playgrounds. Hover, nudge, Show we care, And then we got to do Something concrete-- Something big, Something important, Something that means jobs. That means building Bank exchange. I'm not gonna let These shootings interfere With my program For the city. Leslie, I'm going to speak At the little boy's Funeral-- James bone's funeral. I think that's a blueprint For trouble, sir. I don't care. It's the right thing To do. I'm gonna do it. I don't think you'll be Welcome there, mr. Mayor. Well, they got me anyway. Come on. Let's go to work. Come on. All right. Kevin, I need you. So, what happened? Frank anselmo and His real-estate cronies Is what happened. They want the subway stop To increase the value Of their land On the city property. The property Around bank exchange? Yeah. And? Anselmo said No subway stop, No bank exchange. And you said? Ok. I thought we could Keep anselmo On the back burner, But we gotta have Bank exchange. We need those jobs. We need that money going Into the community. I understand. Given the situation Of broadway and marcy, It's politically expedient. Oh, to hell with Politically expedient. I'm talking about A 60-story building That's going to employ 3,000 people. It's going to put Food on the table, Roof overhead. That's what counts. That's what we're about. That's bank exchange. That's all it is. I thought you said we can't Afford a subway stop. That's gonna take Politics. More than one way To skin a cat. Now get in there, keep That staff fired up. You're the boss. Kevin, what are you Doing tonight? Hadn't thought about it. You ever see the play Carousel? The musical? You serious? A little bit Before my time. It's good. You're gonna love it. Frank anselmo's Gonna be there. I'm free. * But somehow I can see * * just exactly * * how i'd be * * if I loved you * * time and again I will try to say * * all i'd want you * * to know * * if I loved you * * words wouldn't come In an easy way... * George.

I mean, I don't know If it's my old ears Or the subway Running underneath. Did you like The billy bigelow? He's good. Uh, good voice. Yeah. What'd you think Of the julie jordan? Good act. No voice. My nettie Could sing better. We met 25 years ago Westbury music thing. I heard about that. Yeah? Speaking of Performances, frank, I don't want to hear About another one Like that one You gave this morning. Your boy embarrassed me. You're gonna have To live with it. Why? Because he's my boy. Ohh. Is that it? There's oil under That vacant lot, frank. Jobs. You don't need To politic me. I run kings county. Jobs for people Of this city, frank, Not leases for lenny lasker, Murray safire, And all your greedy pals. What's happened To you, john, huh? Just because this kid thinks He can elect you president, You're gonna forget Who got you here? I don't forget anything. You're developing A short memory, frank, Or a very selective one. You want me To refresh it for you? I'm sorry, john. Frank, here it is... The off-ramp Costs me 5 million. Another 35 million For the subway stop. Now, you're gonna get 3 1/2 from me. The rest, I gotta go beg albany. Now, I got better things To beg for from albany. I got a solution. How about a spur Off the-- A spur? What, are you crazy? A spur is 120 million A track mile. Bank exchange Is good for the poor. It's good For the jobless. It's good for The whole goddamn city. As for subway stops, Infrastructure, Off-ramps-- We can't afford it. Well, then you're gonna have To forget the whole thing. I love the second-act Opening. Good. Then you're not Gonna want to miss it. This was A real nice clambake. I'm building up My i.o.u.s with albany. Next year, The governor's Gonna have to step up With a new subway stop, Or I won't support him For reelection. And the off-ramp? Next year. It's already factored Into my budget. Next year Is too far away. You're only a boss, frank. I'm the fucking mayor. Mayors rule. Bank exchange. My way or the highway.

That's for The dead cop. * ...book is open * * what then? * * What then? * * What then? * * And the world * * that rejected * * its savior * * will have... * Reverend chapman Will introduce me? With one sentence. And then what? We get out of here. And which way is that? Side door. No, no. We're going Out the front door. Is that a good idea? Intel's out there now, And they say that people Are not happy. * What then? * Sisters... Brethren... The mayor of the city Of new york, The honorable john pappas. Thank you, reverend. I was warned Not to come here. I was warned. They warned me... Don't stand Behind that coffin. But why should I heed Such a warning... When a heartbeat Is silent... And a child lies dead? Don't stand Behind this coffin. That boy was as pure And as innocent As the driven snow. But I must stand here, Because I have not given you What you should have. Until we can walk abroad And recreate ourselves, Until we can stroll along The streets like boulevards, Congregate in parks Free from fear, Our families mingling, Our children laughing, Our hearts joined, Until that day, We have no city. You can label me a failure Until that day. The first and perhaps Only great mayor Was greek. He was Pericles of athens, And he lived Some 2,500 years ago, And he said... "all things good Of this earth Flow into the city..." Amen. Amen. "Because Of the city's greatness." Well, we were great once. Can we not be great again? Yes, we can. Yes. Now, I put that question To james bone, And there's only silence. Yet... Could not something pass From this sweet youth to me? Could he not empower me To find in myself The strength... To have the knowledge, To summon up the courage To accomplish this seemingly Insurmountable task Of making a city livable? Just livable. Yes. Yes. There was a palace That was a city. It was a palace! It was a palace, And it can be A palace again! A palace in which There is no king or queen Or dukes or earls Or princes, But subjects all, Subjects beholden To each other To make A better place to live. Is that Too much to ask? No! No! Are we asking too much From that? Is it beyond Our reach? No! No! Because if it is, Then we are nothing But sheep Being herded To the final slaughterhouse! I will not go down That way! Right on! Right! I choose to fight back! Right! Amen! That's right! I choose to rise, not fall! Amen! That's right! I choose to live, not die! And I know-- I know That what's within me Is also within you! Amen. Amen! That's why I ask you now... To join me. Join me. Rise up with me. Amen. Amen. Rise up on the wings Of this slain angel! Amen. Amen. We'll rebuild on the soul Of this little warrior. Amen! Amen! We will pick up His standard And raise it high! Yes! Amen! Carry it forward Until this city... Your city... Our city... His city... Is a palace again! Is a palace again! I am with you, Little james. I am you. Thank you Very much, mr. Mayor. God bless you, Mr. Mayor. God bless you, too. Thank you So much. Great speech, Mr. Mayor. Terrible thing, To bury a child. Your trip to washington. The stuff for The convention committee. History of new york city For senator marquand. Reservation At the willard hotel. Lincoln stayed there, By the way. Enough about me. Enough about me. What are you gonna do Tonight after i'm gone? Me? I don't know. I hadn't thought about it. Well, you're going to Get yourself a good meal, You're going to pass up That double-cheeseburger From roy rogers, Wherever it is you go, And you're gonna go To dominick's, And you're gonna Get take-out on me. Get a decent meal there. But before you go To dominick's, I want you To go to macy's And get a chair With legs and arms. That apartment of yours... Looks like something that Belongs in a homeless file. Oh, then it's off To crate & barrel For a knife, a fork, A spoon... Oh, and a glass While you're at it. Then i'd have to get A dishwasher. You don't have To wash them. Just throw them out After you finish eating. It's on me. Get a life. I've got yours. It's quite enough. You read this? Today's Times editorial. "Judge or be judged." Yes. "...not withstanding "judge stern's Distinguished record, "one must ask The question, Would he be On the bench In he were not A former law partner Of the mayor's?" Oh. I didn't appoint him. He was nominated Like everybody else. Sure, but everybody knows The party arranges The nomination of judges. Hey, whose side Are you on? I'm on yours, And I always will be, But I smell A hanging party. I think we should put A little bit of distance Between ourselves And walter stern. Distance is shit. Distance. Distance is something You do to your enemies. It's a thing of the nineties To make friends extinct. Distance is the absence Of menschkeit. Translate that for me. You don't know What menschkeit means? No, I don't. Menschkeit. You know, Something between men. It's about honor, Character. Untranslatable. That's why It's yiddish. I didn't know you'd Taken up the language. Abe laid it on me. Abe. Abe's a good man. You're a good man, Pappy. Underneath That louisiana cane syrup, Plain red dirt. Not all that different From the pavements of astoria Where i'm from. You and me... We're sticking by Judge walter stern. Man, thou art dust, And to dust... Thou shalt return. Mrs. Santos, if there's Anything I can do, Please feel free To call. Thanks for the words. It's the least We can do. Good morning. Where's the mayor? He had to go to washington This morning On convention business. A detective killed In the line of duty Rates an inspector's Funeral, And that includes The mayor. Let me assure you The mayor's absence In no way diminishes His concern for mrs. Santos And her children. Where do they get that stuff From in the newspapers? At school, They tell my little girl Her daddy was a drug dealer. I'm so sorry. We'll get Our press people right on it. Never mind The newspapers. What about Internal affairs? What are those clowns Out there doing? Where you going? The city. I thought We were in the city. Not if you're From queens. Let's start over. Where are you going? Manhattan. Hop in. Go fuck yourself. Not to be Disrespectful, But you realize The transportation Department of saint anne's Wasn't prepared For 1,000 people. 999! We were expecting The mayor. And you're just gonna wait under That plastic awning for an hour And then ride a queens bus And then slep on a subway To manhattan. Schlep! Schlep, not slep. Schlep. Schlep. Get the gumbo Out of your yiddish. How do you feel About the l.i.e.? I hate the l.i.e. Take the grand central. Catch it At astoria boulevard. Go ahead. I'll show you. Eddie santos Was a good cop. You're doing A vile thing. It's wrong. It's wrong to blame A dead cop. It's wrong to steal A widow's rights. It's wrong. You keep saying that. Nobody's doing anything. You've got all the answers, Don't you? Don't even have The questions yet. Well, I got a question For you. Yeah? You hungry? Yeah. Swing by that diner up there, The north star. Best philly steak sandwiches In new york city. Or do you call them Philadelphia steak sandwiches? Now, who we gonna meet In this diner? What are you Talking about? You surface in front Of my car at the cemetery, You show just enough leg So i'd stop, And the grand Central parkway Is the long way around. Who we gonna meet? Albert holly. He was eddie santos' partner 2 years ago When tino zapatti Got probation. Thank you. When eddie Got ahold of something, He wouldn't let go. Eddie santos Was a pit bull. Pit bull's are ugly, But they're not stupid. What was he doing Without a backup? Wasn't the first time He'd taken tino down. Only he'd never had A problem with him before. Somehow... Tino must've Got the drop on him. It happens. Why didn't santos Let anybody else know He was going up there? Because It was his collar. He made that case Against tino. Then the judge Went south. There is no way Tino zapatti could've Walked 2 years ago unless... Unless interested parties Had the judge In their pocket. Walter stern is a jurist Of national reputation. I don't care if he's Oliver wendell holmes. Somebody got to him. And based On that one interview... You were able To come the conclusion Stated in your testimony? That and The v.a. Records. Yes. Is it unusual... Would you mind passing This on to the judge? Thanks. ...based on Only one interview? The defendant has A lengthy documented Case hist-- please Answer the question. Would you restate The question? All right. Based on That one interview, You were able to come to-- Where are you going With this, mr. Mckenna? Your honor, The witness interprets The defendant V.a. Record one way. Our psychologist Interprets it another. And another and another Until the end of time. So much for expert witnesses. Let's take a break. 2:30 all right For everybody? Ah, mr. Calhoun. I see you've already met Peter ragan, my law clerk. This young man has written Some of my best opinions. He appeared before me First time I presided Over the moot court at yale. I'd say peter and i Are joined at the hip. Thanks, peter. Please, have a seat. Thank you for seeing me, Judge stern. And how can I help you? Tino zapatti. What about him? How did tino zapatti Get offered probation? Mr. Calhoun... I can only sentence In accordance With a conviction. Mr. Zapatti was convicted Of a criminal possession In the fourth degree. They found a kilo In his car. Is it your intention To try the case again? No, not at all, sir, But I read the rap sheet. Mr. Calhoun, I am certified In the state of new york As a supreme court judge, And you're sitting here Rearguing a 2-year-old case. You're out of line, sir, And i'm going to so inform The mayor. I'm here on The mayor's behalf. You think i've slept The last 2 nights? Don't you realize I know what a mistake I made? That's it. Satisfied? No basement Or anything? You saw it. The rumpus room. The knotty pine With the pool table? Yeah, that's right, Captain. Mrs. Santos, I'm only doing my job. I'm really very sorry About this. Oh, sorry, crap! You're snooping around Eddie's house like a nazi. Please. You know this is The last thing I wanted to do. Then why don't you get the hell Out of internal affairs And get yourself An honest job? Hello. Yeah. Marybeth. Yeah, 2-bars has been In here all morning. He went over the place From top to bottom. Yeah. Look, you gotta do something About eddie's pension. They're gonna try And reduce it.

Emergency service unit workers Are now clearing out... Frank. Yeah, i'm up At the cabin. They found The money. Good work. I'm watching it now. ...is his connection To the deaths Of james bone And tino zapatti? What was santos doing With $40,000? The mayor understands The implications this morning Of the state troopers' discovery In ulster county... But he would like to stress that These are implications only. Moreover, until a connection Can be made Between detective santos And the $40,000-- $40,000 In a cop's strongbox? Come on, You gotta admit... Can you believe This shit? No. We never even set foot In that dump After eddie's father died. It's full of hornets' nests. Yeah, busy hornets. And never in our life Did we see $4,000 cash, Much less 40. Hello?

That's right. Cousins. They have cousins In louisiana? Oh, down there, We all cousins, 'Cause if you got a cousin, You got a vote. So then why don't you Run for office Instead of carrying The mayor's bag? I consider it an honor Not only to carry his bag, But also to fill it At night With the things I think the city needs. Oh, the kingmaker. The man Behind the throne. I'm beginning to suspect You don't like politicians. You're no politician. Politicians run for office. You're a walker. Hmm. All right, you're gonna Want to take a right At this gas station, Because we are Almost there. Thank you. Vinnie sure likes Strange places. Looks like monday night In key largo.

I said They were dangerous. Wonder what vinnie's doing In a place like this? Wonder what we're doing In a place like this? Hmm. This is it. Where's our boy? I don't know.

Leapfrogged back and forth From committee staffer To congressional assistant Until the mayor of new york city Came down to testify. And he gave a speech that day On the floor I remember That will stay with me For the rest of my life. I went up to him afterwards And told him I admired him And what he stood for, And while I was thanking him, He asked me if I liked stone crabs. Halfway through dinner, I had a new job, At the end of dinner, It felt like I had a new home. And here we go. I hear the curve in your voice, But let me tell you something. I've been with John pappas for 3 years, And i've finally found A place in government Where, pardon the expression, You can make a difference. Well, you did. You did. You certainly made a Difference to elaine santos. You found wakeley, Clear eddie's name. Get them their pension. Yeah, but not so fast. We gotta keep wakeley on ice Till I find that report. Well, we don't Need the report. We just take Wakeley's deposition. No, that's all you need. I gotta get that report, See what's on it, See where it leads. But what if while You're playing detective, What if james wakeley Suddenly decides It'd be healthier To just disappear And we're left with nothing? How is elaine santos Supposed to feed her kids? That's a risk We're gonna have to take. That's a risk you're Going to have to take, Because I don't need you to Get wakeley's deposition. If you insist on talking To james wakeley on your own, I guarantee you You will feel the full weight Of the mayor's office Bearing down upon you. It's not a pleasant feeling. You're a mean prick. You know that? Where I come from, That's a compliment. Hold on a minute. For what? Your ambition and John pappas' coattails? Burger, fries, coke, And a lemon pudding. I'll take these. The mayor's boy Gets the lemon pudding. Mr. Schwartz? Kevin calhoun. I just been talking To a friend of yours. Hello? Schwartz here. I've got The probation report. Where are you?

Right, but I wasn't sure. That was only a feeling. Well, now it's a fact, And 5 people are dead. Walter stern looked so judicial. How could he be so corrupt? The sweater unravels. I'll give you one This time. The only thing new in this world Is the history you don't know. New testament? Harry truman. Judge walter stern's A good man. He's good? 5 people are dead! Ok, what's your point? You throw the book At the guy, And you hurry Out of the way. Embrace Detective santos. Max death settlement For the widow. Medal of honor For the deceased. And I make sure leslie Makes the morning Editions with it. So you got this All figured out? That's my job, Isn't it? Well, that's cold, pappy. That's cold. I mean, you don't just... It's more complicated Than that, no? Yeah. Forgive me. I know the two Of you are old friends. Be careful How you judge people, Most of all, friends. You don't sum up a man's life In one moment. There are no cold answers, Are there? There's no simple Yes or no. A man's life is not the bricks, It's the mortar, pappy. It's the stuff that Lays between, the stuff-- The stuff you can't see. I've known walter My whole life. God, the man is-- He's a decent man. He's a good man. But this is tough stuff. This is body bag stuff. You tell me if There's some other way. There isn't. The die's been cast. It was cast a long time ago. Go easy. Give him a blindfold And have mercy. Walter stern was a tough man, But he was fair. We give back the same, no? And you be careful. Keep george with you. Let him drive. I gotta go in here. Yeah. I knew james wakeley Would surface. Just as I knew when That bullet hit that boy, It would keep traveling. Then Find its way... To me. If only it had Found me first. If only I could have Stepped in front of him. Regrets are pathetic, Aren't they? I was tired of being The white-shoe litigator, Defending the arbitrageurs Or the eighties go-go boys. All it took was $50,000 To change my life. 50,000, And the judgeship was mine. Absurd, isn't it? The mayor has always Had the highest regard For you, judge. And I for him. Your resignation In about 6 months Would be Appropriate. 6 months, did you say? How about 6 hours? This is the scene This morning Outside the district Attorney's office Where several city officials Have been brought in For questioning in The rapidly developing story Surrounding the resignation Of judge walter stern. After the checks And balances wrap, We go into... "the recent revelations Are not unprecedented.

And this is the original Probation report, The one we were Looking for. They found it In anselmo's car. The police commissioner Gave it to me. He didn't want it ending up As tomorrow's headline. "Tino zapatti." "Recommended prison sentence-- 10-20 years." Check this one out? This one's kosher. So the story ends Where it all began. White-shoe lawyer. Brooklyn clubhouse boss. No. Walter stern And frank anselmo-- Don't see 'em In the same room. Something's still wrong With the picture, you know. I know. Before we nail up the house For the season, One more door to close.

You keep a log Of phone calls? Yes. Take a minute for me, Please. Look up the dates of Frank anselmo's calls To this office. You're in the wrong pew, Mr. Calhoun.

Trying to get through To senator marquand. Well, he got Through to me. Yeah? They're moving The convention to miami. Miami? Why? They like miami. Lots of glamour. You got Whoopi goldberg. Madonna just bought Houses in south beach. Who knows? Maybe we Can nominate them. I thought it was all cut. Cut? Not cut. Politics, pappy. Nothing's cut. Where are you going? I'm gonna pay my respects To nettie anselmo. Do you think that's wise? What's wise got To do with it? Because the perception's Gonna-- Oh, fuck perception. Perception. I'm talking menschkeit. Stuff between men. You know, The there that's there, The thousand Telephone calls, The bouquets And the brickbats... The space between A handshake. You know. The stuff that goes With you to your grave. The space between a handshake For right and wrong? Why are you pressing me Tonight? What's up? I'm looking For an answer. You want an answer? Ok, pappy. Think of it as colors. There's black, And there's white, And in between is Mostly gray. That's us. Now, Gray is a tough color, Because it's not as simple As black and white, And for the media, Certainly not As interesting. But it's who we are. What are you Gonna do now? You mean we. We're gonna fight The sons of bitches. We're gonna Come out swinging. We're gonna tell them, "hey, we're only human. "Everybody makes mistakes. "Frank anselmo is dead. He was a friend. But the last of The clubhouse bosses is gone." We're gonna clean up The augean stables. We're gonna show up in miami, Have them on their knees Begging me to make The keynote speech. And then? A short sojourn To albany, Followed by a long one At the white house. If I didn't know better, I'd be bursting With admiration. I thought i'd come in here And find you on your knees. Instead you're ready to turn Adversity into triumph. Oh, that's just a reflex, An old habit of mine, But it's still good To hear you say it. The way you say it, too. Adversity into triumph. It's good to know You still believe in me. Did I say that? I don't know. That's what I thought you did. Don't fathers Listen to their sons? How is your father These days? I haven't heard you Mention him for quite a while. Where is he? He's in a nursing home In crowley, louisiana. Plays dominoes With orderlies. Fulminates over His cream of wheat. Ho. Don't be Too hard on him. We can't dictate Our finishes, you know. I don't like The sound of that. Of course you don't. Because underneath All that need to believe, Hmm? Under all the concrete You poured into my pedestal, Something is crying To get out. What? You know I called Judge walter stern. Yes. Anselmo called me. I knew the mafioso Had called him, But in this business, You don't trade names. And I called walter. That's all there was To it. I was doing Anselmo a favor. Run caution lights All my life. This time you ran a red, And someone cut across The intersection-- A cop And a 6-year-old child. That's with me forever. That's not good enough. Not good enough? Ugh! You think I don't know that? I hope so, john. Scares me When you call me john. Yeah? Why's that? Because i, uh... I thought a minute ago We were... Off to the white house. I... I thought I could Feel you come aboard. You know, The old menschkeit. Horseshit. Menschkeit is horseshit. It's 120 years of graft And sweetheart contracts And featherbeds And inside information And golden parachutes, And everywhere, People in power Gather up To carve up the turf. That's your menschkeit. It's horseshit, And you know Where you can put it. Maybe spread it out All over the fields. We cross our fingers, Get a little rain, Maybe a flower will grow. It has. Out of all this crap... You emerged. You're the only voter I ever cared-- I'm getting That old con feeling, john, Like you copping a plea. No, come on. No plea. Nope. I'm just a pol Who kept rolling along Until he ran Into a stone wall. You were that wall, And I realized, Just like me When I was a kid. Young, ambitious, Go-getter... but fair? Trading up, of course, But always for The right causes. You're doing good. You're not putting Money in your pocket. You're just trying to Maintain your position, Your power. 'Cause what good are you To the people without it? But down deep... You know... There's a line You can't cross. And after A thousand trades, One deal too many... The line Gets rubbed out. I had the fire In the belly Just like you, kevin. And the odd thing is, I still have it. Never left me. I had the dream... And I had the weight. Like one of those guys Before me said... "if a sparrow dies In central park, I feel responsible." Well said. I feel that way. And I was gonna take That feeling with me... All the way To washington. The things You could've done. Fucking things I could have done. You're gonna take Yourself out, john. You're gonna Take yourself out. Take a long vacation In greece. Pick up the law again. Go the way of William o'dwyer. He fucked up and played Ambassador to mexico. I'm not that ambitious. Then suck it up And find some other way. Listen to you. I thought i'd see A boy's tears. The tears are there. You just can't See 'em right now. You got the stuff, pappy. I love to see it In a guy. Kevin calhoun For city council.
