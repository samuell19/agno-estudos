MAN: Faster! Faster! How the hell are ya? That's my little brother. I promised Mom I would always protect him. But I had a feeling this one was gonna be different. Something was telling me this time, one of us wasn't gonna make it back home. How long we gotta be out here? As long as it takes, little brother. Until you know that place like the back of your hand. I hate this part. Look, there ain't no action, man. You're gonna get plenty. Soon enough. What about the others? Don't worry. They'll be here. My friend the Reverend. Some say he found God. After the Devil rejected him. Who are you? Born of the dust, I was made in His image. LINC: Gentleman thief. Kansas. He was my wild card. Full House, gentlemen. No. I don't never lose. Especially to no thief. Gentlemen. WOMAN: Somebody get the Sheriff. LINC: But there was one more. To do this job, I had to find Mara. It wasn't hard. She was still up to her old tricks. What the hell? What the hell's the matter with you, Indian? I don't think this squaw speaks no English. Coin? (LAUGHING) She thinks she's gonna rob us! Be prepared to meet your maker, Savage! Oh boy. We don't take kindly to your type around here. And what type would that be? Sneaky, lowlife niggas like yourselves. Uh-oh. Now you done gone and did it. Done what? Done gone and made him mad. See he don't like blacks calling other blacks "niggas". Boy, are you kidding me? There's 6 of us and 2 of you. You know, you right. And that don't seem fair, do it? So, um you want to run off and get some more men? (CHUCKLES) Kill 'em. Kill 'em! (URGING HORSE) (CREAKING) (LAUGHING) Looks like game's over, huh, Fancy Pants. Now that wasn't very gentleman-like, was it? (GUN COCKING) Come on. Looks like we got ourselves a real Mexican standoff, now don't we? Well, since I'm a gambling man, I'm betting on me. Ah, damnit, woman! Brother Willoughby. You're not taking the Lord's name in vain, are you? You know, for a preacher man, you sure hang out with a motley crew. A hustler and a half-breed. Only the Lord may judge, brother Willoughby. I merely tend to the flock. Well, you're okay with me. Hell, hell, the gang's all here. Thought you two got out of the game. Hell, you know me. I get bored easy. How's tricks? I suppose you oughta ask Mara. I must admit, I was intrigued when I received your letter. We all were. Zane and I wouldn't have bothered if it wasn't worth it. Who's that? This here is my friend, Medicine Man. His Christian name is Jacob. His heathen name is Running Fox. (LAUGHING) -No offense to present company. -(CHUCKLES) LINC: We met up at Doc Willoughby's cabin. I called and they answered. This gang is like family and family don't ask questions. There wasn't much in it for them, and they knew that. This job was personal. This time, it was about me and my brother. Okay, guys. This is our next job. Zane got this from a former bank associate who will no longer be needing it. The town's name is Corazon de la Muerte, which means Heart of Death. About a half day's ride from here. Yeah, the bank's a depository for the railroad. Railroad. That means a lot of money. It also means a lot of guns. Which means a lot of bullets and a lot of death. So we're gonna come in in twos, split, I'm gonna take the point. Kansas, I need you back here. Mara, by this window. As usual, fear is in our favor. Let's keep it that way. But why this bank? LINC: Because it belongs to him. Yeah. (LAUGHS) Well, get on with it. It's official, Mr. Driscoll. You now effectively own the bank, like everything else in this town. I get what I pay for. Is there something else? Yeah... Uh, Mr. Driscoll, uh, the Chamber of Commerce feel that the taxes are, well, they're too exacerbated. Tell me Mr. Mayor, where would this town be without my protection and investments? Do you think I like this God-forsaken shit-hole? This town is like any other town I've brought up. -Purely a means to an end. -(GUNS FIRING) There, you see? My son, Bert. My pride and joy. And a fine, upstanding citizen! He's a good-for-nothing asshole, but he's my son. What's a man to do? (CHUCKLES) Groom him to be my successor, that's what. I'll tell you what, Crawley. Bert would make a great Mayor. Now wait a minute, that's my... No one's got a job unless I allow it. Is that clear to everyone? -Yes. -Absolutely clear, Mr. Driscoll. He owns everything. May as well change the name of the town to Driscollville. (GROANS) Asshole. (GRUNTING) MAN 1: Whoa! MAN 2: Whoa! MAN 3: Somebody stop him. Sheriff! Sheriff, there's trouble! Please, it's my Ma. They're gonna kill her. Leave her alone! (GUN FIRES) Ma! Ma? Ma! Ma! Ma! Come on. We're outta here. -Oh. -Damn you, Bert. I ain't doin' it now for you, alright? There ain't no call for this. It ain't none of your business. (GUNS COCKING) Listen, you can't even touch me, so just go away, okay? Go away. Come on, boys, drinks on the house. Take her to the undertaker. Hey, Sheriff, can I ask you a question? Shoot. I mean, it's a piece of crap town. Nobody cares about it. Why do you care? Are you all right, sir? I would like to make a considerable deposit, into your fine establishment. Of course. However, I was wondering, for my own peace of mind when would the railroads be coming through to pick up the deposits? Oh, I'm not allowed to give out that kind of information. You'd have to speak with the bank manager, Mr. Hickle, about that. You know, being that there are all sorts of unsavory types lurking about dealing with folks such as ourselves is a much more pleasant situation. Catch my meaning? Oh. Much obliged. Miss, uh, Lorelie? But what about your deposit? I have some other matters to tend to. Two ships merely passing in the night. Bert. Yo, Pop. Why are we still here? I mean, what are we doing? For now, this is our town, Bert. Our town makes me sick. I've changed the name. Makes us more at home. Every father, Bert, lives in the dream that his child would be greater than himself. That he will surpass him, not just in material things, but will in time come to show more compassion, more love, patience, than I have been able to show. Every day, you make me lose faith in that dream. * Am I, am I am I my brother's keeper * Are you a believer * Can you stand the rain What will it be, gents? Whiskey all around. Do you think this a prudent idea? We gotta wet our whistle before we hit the trail. What if somebody recognizes us? Ain't nobody gonna recognize us. * Don't mind the flow I'll try to reach you though * Ain't nothing calming about it Check the dough * We held on tight for years of this * Hold on tight for years of bliss * How do you want to do this? We're gonna drink up, then walk out, then ride out of town. He's right there. If we cause a scene, we're gonna blow the job. Fuck that job. Easy now, little brother. Give me the bottle. Shall I put that on your tab, Mr. Driscoll? On his tab? Don't you know who his Daddy is? You can tear it up. My old man owns this joint. Go away. I ain't paying. Everybody got to pay. What was that? Everybody got to pay? I said, you gonna pay. Do I know you, boy? I said, do I know you, boy? I'm sure you remember me. No, I don't remember you. No. Refresh my memory, huh? Burned our farm. Murdered our kin. You know, I do a lot of that. You can't expect me to remember every farm I burned. Little place out the Flat Ridge. Came between you and your railroad. Oh, yeah. I remember that one. Lot of screaming. What, did you run away? Did you run off and leave your family? Huh? I'd of walked back. You should never assume a man is dead. Just 'cause you shot him. That's good advice. I'll remember that next time... (GUN FIRING) Ain't no next time. (YELLING) * Same struggle same hood Brothers in arms is all good * Are you a believer * Can you stand the rain Ah, hell. I'm sorry, Mr. Driscoll. I'm sorry that, uh... You were here? Did you see them? Did you see who killed my son? Uh, I'm afraid not. Uh... No one... but no one crosses a Driscoll, and lives to tell about it. Get me Wolverton. What were you thinking? He had it coming and more. They saw us! Our cover is blown! We can't go back there now. It could have gone better. Maybe we can use this to our advantage. What you thinking? The last thing they're gonna expect is for us to come back and hit the bank. Right. Because it's suicide. Are you serious? I thought he was the crazy one. Hey, man, don't call me that. What did you learn at the bank? Well, the payroll is scheduled to be picked up at noon. A quarter of a million dollars, the day after tomorrow. (INDISTINCT) Take three men out back. Don't let anyone get past you, hear me? -Now go! -Yes, yes, Uncle. You! Come here! (GUNS COCKING) Fire. (GROANING) REVEREND: Everybody stay down! -Go! Go! -No shit. -Stay down! Stay down! -Ah, shit! Man, shut up. We've been in tougher scrapes than this before. LINC: Man, shoot! Go! I think we overstayed our welcome! I swear to God, if I get killed, my ghost is gonna come back and bust yo ass. Cover me, now! I'm going out! Go! Go! (YELLING) Hey, why did you stop me? Why did you stop me? -It was him! -Who? Wolverton! Anybody hurt? Okay, these longcoats are like wild coyotes. Once they get their teeth into you, they're not gonna... Hey! What's the plan? Mara knows these parts better than anyone. -I know a spot. -Okay, lead on. I thought I told you to watch the back. -Uncle, I did. -I told you nobody gets by. Uncle Wolverton, I tried. I swear to you, I tried. There was a guy in a tree. We never saw him. He froze. No. It's all right. It's all right. We're still gonna get 'em. Now, you're my favorite nephew. (GUN FIRES) Now let's mount up. I want that bounty. I take first watch. Sure you up to it? Oh, yeah. All right, then. I'll sleep good for a change. Come on. (LAUGHING) Spill the beans, Rev. Come on, Rev give it up. KANSAS: Tell us about Mara. What's it like? Flesh of my flesh, bone of my bones. Come on, man, with that! Half black, half Indian. Come on. That must be real sweet. Must be great. It's like finding a cactus flower amongst sagebrush. What the hell? What the... Oh! And a cactus has thorns. KANSAS: She's a wild one. When we hit that bank we gotta do it by the book. Not that book. Nobody gets hurt. We get what we want and we get out. Clear? I got your back. And everything should go off without a hitch. Couldn't keep your mouth shut. Ah, yes, good afternoon, Sheriff. Greetings. Uh, how you feeling this fine day? Well, I was, uh... We were wondering... For heaven's sake, get to the point already. Yes, dear. Well, it's about this rampant violence. Uh, something's gotta be done about it. You can get rid of it today. We can? Yep. With a million dollars and the 7th Cavalry. (LAUGHING) No disrespect intended, Sheriff, uh, if I do say so, you are handling your duties magnificently. Uh, and as Mayor... I got a hole in my coat. As Mayor of Corazon de... Driscollville. Driscollville, it is my responsibility to insure that you have whatever you need to do your job to the best of your ability. All I need is one thing, Mayor. What might that be? More bullets. (LAUGHING) Bullets? More bullets. Afternoon, Sheriff. Mayor. Tell me you got them. Not yet, sir. Excuses are a dime a dozen, and not worth a plugged nickel. Mr. Driscoll, a man's reputation is everything. Now I've collected every bounty I've ever gone after, this here ain't gonna be no different. Now, there's been a change in plans. (PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Yes, may I help you? Me and my men are here to pick up the payroll early. This is highly irregular. Orders straight from Mr. Driscoll. I see. How early? First thing in the morning. Fine. Okay, as soon as we come in, Zane, you handle the guards. Don't kill anybody unless you got to. Mara, if we need to blast, you got us covered? I got it. Okay. Rev, you handle the tellers and any customers. Kansas, I need you to cover this window right here. Make sure nobody joins our little party. If we do this right, we all walk out rich bastards. And if we don't? Then lunch is on you tomorrow. (ALL CHUCKLE) Okay. Enough talk. Let's play some music. (PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Hey. Tight britches. Why you always fiddlin' with them playing cards, huh? Because they help sharpen the reflexes, madame. What did you call me? You trying to say something about my past? That's not what he meant. Nah, I heard him. Anybody ever see such a pretty cowboy? Huh? I think Kansas here is one of them Dandies. That's enough, Mara. Mmm-mmm. That's why you wear them gloves? Why you dress like that, anyway, huh? You think you better than us or something? Mara. Is that why you wear them Polly Anny gloves? Yeah. I want to know why. Okay. That's why. I used to be a painter. I had myself a little gallery. That is, before the Klan paid me a visit. I lost everything. Kansas... I tracked all of them down, one by one. The law's been looking for me ever since. I swore that no matter what, in the end, I shall be holding the cards. (MOANING) Why are you still awake? You know I'm always psyched before a job. What the hell? Man, now that is one strange-ass couple. -A Reverend -And a soiled dove. How the hell did they hook up, anyway? She didn't have it easy. A woman of leisure who was nearly whipped to death by her master. And the Rev, he was the preacher up at Long Pine. The place of the massacre. He was forced to watch his wife and child killed right in front of him. (SCREAMING) That night, he lost his faith. Who could do something like that? That low down dirty Wolverton. I'm glad Mom can't see us now. Hey, we're doing all this for Mom. Remember? Yeah. But it's gotta be the last one. We gotta get back home. All we got is each other, little brother. I'm gonna catch some shut-eye. You should do the same. Lost something? I'm sure Mara didn't mean anything. She was just riding you. But I ain't a horse. Well, not of course. A Midsummer Night's Dream. Lovers and madmen have such seething brains. That's Mr. William Shakespeare. Shakespeare's dreams. Hmm, I got nightmares too. Except they're with me when I wake up. This town, Corazon... Think it's gonna be one of them? Mmm-Hmm. The big score. The chance to cash out. I just want to get out of this life alive. (HORSES NEIGHING) (HORSES NEIGHING) No. They're headed back to Corazon. It may be a shithole, but it's the only shithole between here and the border. I got a feeling they got business there. Come on. Come on. (GUNS COCKING) Nobody move. (WOMAN GASPS) Touch it and you got two choices. Die slow or die slower. (WOMAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY) You move, I'll slice your throat. Smarter than you look. Let's move it. What is the meaning of this? What's the matter, ain't you ever been robbed before? I have not. Little brother, we got us here a virgin. (COCKING GUN) Congratulations. You just got your cherry popped. Now move it. Merciful is the Lord. Co-operate and no one gets hurt. Now, come on. Back the fuck up. Come on. Open it up. Don't rush me, I can't get it in the hole. Now open the door. We ain't askin'. We're rich. Hurry up. Whoo. I'm getting this money, y'all. (LAUGHING) Jackpot. Turn around! Now, if anybody peeps, I'm gonna blow your heads off. (SOBBING) LINC: Come on. (CHURCH BELL RINGING) What the Hell is this? (GUNS COCKING) MARA: Cover for me. ZANE: Let's go. Back in the bank! MARA: Back inside. (SCREAMING) Get everyone. Damn, where'd they come from? They sure came a lot earlier than we thought they would. No shit. Everybody relax. We're gonna get out. -How? -Linc, how? You, come here. Mr. HICKLE: Me...? Shut up. I ain't got time for this. Where's the back exit? There isn't one. What about the motherfuckin' back window? From the looks of things, they thought of that, too. You, come here. Linc, did we fuck up? No. I fucked up. WOMAN:...still hurts. I say we blast our way out. Hey, as hot as you are, Miss, you shouldn't be working that there. Look, we got hostages. Why don't we use them as shields? Wait, hold on. We're not using the hostages. Why not? Because they innocent, that's why. No one's innocent. MARA: I'm getting the fuck out of here. Mara, wait. The longer we stay in here the more men they get out there. What are we gonna do? (SIGHS) I need a drink. We're gonna go with Mara's idea. -About? -We gotta use the hostages. -Linc! -We have no choice. MARA: Get up. Get up. Get up. Get in there. (FEARFUL CHATTER) Move it. Move it. You hear that? I don't hear nothin'. They just realized we got hostages. They're waiting for our next move. They're never gonna talk to us. I don't trust Mara with all this hostage shit. Don't worry about her. I got that. Remember what Mom used to tell us when we were kids? No. The only way you don't get into the Lord's gates is when you harm the innocent. Linc, I want to go to heaven some day. Yeah. I hope it's not too soon. Sheriff, you better end this quick, or I will. Lincoln Malone. I think they wish to talk. Lincoln Malone. Why is she only asking for you? I'm going out. Linc. What's going on? I know her. All right. We can get her out in the open. And then plug her full of bullets. Anybody shoot her, they die. Uh, we're on the same team here, remember? Linc, go on with your business. We'll cover you. You sure about this, Sheriff? Yep, I'll be okay. -How do you know that? -I just do. Nobody shoot, okay? Got it? -Make sure of it. -All right, but I still don't think it's a good idea. Hola, Linco. (SPEAKING SPANISH) I never stopped loving you. Even when you chose my best friend over me. All those stories I heard about you? Are they true? That's not the man I knew. The man you knew died a long time ago. Come in with me. It's the best way. To what? Pine box? Hangman's rope? Not even you could stop this. Damn, why did you come back here? Those criminals killed my son and now they've got my money. They're my bounty. What are we gonna do? Go in there, flush them out like the weasels they are. Wolverton? Gather the men. You know this is gonna end bad, right? -(GRUNTS) -(GROANS) And I thought I was lucky. You're not lucky. You're just good. Who fired that shot? It wasn't us, Sheriff. I mean, honest. It must have came from the back. We need to talk. -Mr. Driscoll... -Now. What you think they're doing out there? Fortifying their position. Making preparations for the final assault. How do you know? 'Cause... That's what I would do. Hey. -Where you goin'? -I've been appointed to speak for the group. -How come? -I'm the Mayor's wife. -Is that so? -Mmm-hmm. I'm a little claustrophobic. Can we come out? Yeah, come on. (SIGHING IN RELIEF) WOMAN: Thank you. A queen for a queen. (SOBBING) Shut this kid up. Or else I'll shut him up for good. I hate little kids. (WHIMPERING) You are a man of the cloth. How could you be a part of this? We're gonna let the hostages go. You wanna do what? Look, they're a handful. We got a couple of women, a child, an old man. They're gonna slow us down. Maybe even get us killed. No, no, no, no way. They're the only things that stands between us and them. -We just keep the most valuable one. -Which one? Her. Why her? She's the mayor's wife. Why is one better than a bunch? The Queen is always more valuable than a bunch of Jokers. There must be some mistake. Why don't you keep the bank manager and his wife? If you let me go, I guarantee that my husband, the Mayor, will let you all go free. That's why you're gonna stay. For mom. For Mom. -I don't like this. -You don't like anything. I don't like the way you been running things. You think you could do better? Yeah. What the hell is your problem? (SCREAMING) What are you doing? I'm getting the hell out of here. Mara. You coming or not? You coming? What? There's no need to harm an innocent boy. This kid is our ticket out. You can't go out there. They'll kill you both. Shut the hell up! And mind your own business. I can't let you do this. Then you're gonna have to shoot me. Can you do that? She could not cannot escape her destiny. Destiny's a bitch. Linc! Kansas. Kansas. Just hold on, Mister. My apologies, Lorelie. I guess I ain't that lucky. What the hell do you all think you're doing? You think this is some kind of noble act? (CRYING) This is tragic. Come on, come on, come on. Get 'em out of here. They becomin' a problem. Okay, they all go. But the Mayor's wife, she stays. Come on. Yeah, yeah, I know. Come on, come on, get out of here. Get out of here! Get out of here, come on! No, you. You stay. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Don't shoot. We're letting some of the hostages go. (HORSES GALLAPING) What are you doing? The only thing left to do. -Run, Linc! -Fire. (SOBBING) Sorry, boys. Looks like there's a new Sheriff in town. Don't spend it all in one place. We got the Mayor's wife. We get safe passage out, we'll let her go. Okay. Agreed. Get ready. What are you doing? What needs to be done. You, let's go. Just co-operate ma'am and you'll be home with your husband for supper. MAYOR'S WIFE: Ah! ZANE: Get down, get down, get down. Shit! (GUNSHOTS FIRED) No, Linc, Linc, Linc. Come on. Come on, baby. Don't you die on me. Come on, man. Don't you die on me. Come on, Linc. Anybody hurt? No. Yeah. The Mayor's wife. She's gone. Oh, man. Gonna be all right. Gonna be all right. WOLVERTON: Come out. (LAUGHING) Wolverton. What are you doing? I'm doing God's work. I'm going with God. (SCREAMING) It's time. God be with you, gentlemen. Wolverton! Wolverton! MAN: All right, Boys, let's get out of here. WOLVERTON: Take my cape. I got this. (WHISPERING A PRAYER) How's it look out there? Well, I got good news and I got bad news. We're surrounded by a bunch of killers. -What's the good news? -That was the good news. Well, what's the bad news? Bad news is... ...fun's almost over. I want you to get yourself home. Come on, now, man you know I don't play that. (CHUCKLES) You can't blame your brother for trying. I think any second now they could come up here and get us. So what are we gonna do now? -We leave. -Okay. No. Separately though, brother. What? Rear window. Wolverton's dead. His men moved out front. You can make your, you can make your way out back. Linc, what are you talking about? (PANTING AND WHIMPERING) Oh, God! Remember when we was kids? You used to huddle up in the bed, scared to sleep by yourself in the dark. I use to sit up all night... ...to keep you safe from those monsters, and that scary world outside. Yeah. That was a long time ago, Linc. Last time for me to sit up and look after you. I'll face the dark by myself. You be safe, little brother. No. No, Linc, I'm not leaving you, Man. You're gonna do as I say. You go for that back window. I'll go through the front. I'll hold them down. You don't look back. You hear me? -Linc, stop, man. -It's only me and you left. What kind of sense that make? If we both die? I'm gonna live through you, little brother. (GROANING) On the count of three, you break for the rear and you don't look back. Promise me. I promise. Okay. One... Two... Three. * I feel the love pouring out of me * I'm fading so slowly * This, my destiny (GROANS) (SCREAMS) ( CAPTIVE PLAYING) * I'm drowning in my own tears * What has brought me here * Is this the place for me * You take over and over again * No trace of guilt or shame * Am I captive in your eyes * Give this to my demise * Reflections of who I used to be * Are faint in my memory * What have I become * They haven't washed away completely * Within, there's still beauty * Despite what you have done LINC: So there we were, flying and that was it. * Over and over again LINC:That's my little brother.
