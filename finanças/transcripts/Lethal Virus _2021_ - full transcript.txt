[crowd clamoring] [screams] Fuck, fuck, fuck. [people screaming] [screams] [roars] [screams] What the fuck's going on, man?! What the fuck?! Ah! Ah! Ah! Aha! Yeah. Aha. Yes, Sir, I'll be there. Yeah, understood. Yes, Sir, I'll be there. [baby cries] Have you changed her nappy yet? What happened? I have to go. No, no way, Canum. You promised me. We are dealing with a global alert. Well, let them call someone else. My mom will come to help you with the baby. [roars] Come on. In movies it always works. Jesus Christ! Okay. Oh, smokes... smoking kills. Good to know... I love these... they smell so good. [roars] [shout] [music] First phase completed, Sir. Come on, Canum, you and your team should escort the science team to the lab as soon as possible. Things are getting too complicated too fast at this end. Yes, Sir. - Turn that shit down. - Oh, come on. Do you think you are still in the army, man? This is not Afghanistan. Loosen up, bro. Wait till we get there. What the fuck is that? A crash? I'll get on the radio. Don't stop. Are we stopping? No, we are not stopping. Continue. Okay, boss. Fine with me. Lovecraft to eco-base. Sir, do you copy? What's happening, bro? We lost comms. What? Here? What the fuck man! Shit! I didn't see it was moving. What? A girl? From the crash maybe? I guess. We drive around her and keep moving, no? No way, dude. Oh, come on, you know we have orders. No stopping under any circumstances, and that girl is any circumstances. We'll call when we get back to radio coverage. You know I can't. Come on. We'll pick her up and drop her off somewhere safe. We are stopping to pick up a survivor of the crash. What's happening? We'll stay in the leader vehicle until we find somewhere safe,. There is a girl in the middle of the road. Did he say there's a girl? Hey, sweetie. Are you okay? [snarling] Stop there! [roars] This is a military convoy! Do not get closer! We will open fire! Stop! This is fucking wrong. Johnson! Stop there! Ambush. [gun firing] Ambush. Get back to the transport! Move. Why are they attacking us? What the fuck kind of samples are they? [roars] [gun firing] Let's go! What's happening? Can we help you? [screaming] [screaming] Ah! [gun firing] Get back to the transport! Move. [shout] [scream] [screaming] What the fuck just happened? What are those things? You see what happens when they bite? Did you see their eyes? Save the question for later, Johnson. The whole fucking unit. The whole damn unit, man. We lost them because of that fucking girl. Because of you. Shut up, soldier. We have a mission. Yeah, what mission? The one you just ruined? None of this would've ever happened if you didn't send anybody to check out that fucking girl. Stop. And now what, Captain? Now keep that fucking mouth shut and your eyes open. We have to get along here. I will try to make contact by satellite. Lovecraft to eco-base. Did you receive me? [interference] Sir, we are in a critical situation. The convoy has been attacked. We have lost the entire unit, we need reinforcements. We're in Defcon 1. We are under global biological emergency. Complete your mission. Do not expect reinforcements. Sir, the mission has failed. We have lost everyone, including the scientific delegation. Negative. Dr. Allyson's biological sensor is still active about 15 kilometers west of her position. Locate her, it is an absolute priority. Only she can stop the infection. I am losing the... You must protect her and escort her to the laboratory. I'm losing the signal. Complete your mission. Sir? Sir? Nothing... So, what now? We have a mission. [heavy breathing] [roars] [panting] [bird singing] [music] [squawk] Fuck! [roars] [screams] [screaming] No! [shot] Have you been bitten? No! Please! Don't shoot! You're leading those bloodsuckers into my territory. [roars] Come on, we gotta get out of here. Come on! [heavy breathing] I think we lost them. Now who the fuck are you? My name's Allyson. I'm a biochemist. Ah, just what we need. Another fucking scientist. What the fuck were you doing out here playing zombie bait? I'm headed to the west, I have a mission. Do you have a phone? I really need to make a call. You mean the government's favorite spy gadget? Hell, no. Seriously? Who doesn't have a phone? Yeah, seriously. Shut up. Shut the fuck up now, okay? You're gonna get us both killed. Let's get the fuck out of here. Come on. [bird singing] This looks really bad my friend. So, who killed him? That little brainy bitch? No way. Where are the remains? There's someone else. Where are we going? Oh. I got a secure cabin ready for lockdown until this blows over. It's stocked up with food and weapons and good to go. That's where I'm going. Where are you going, I don't know. Oh yeah, the west, the west. What's in the west, anyway? I have to get to Baxton, okay? Baxton? You can't get to Baxton from here. Why? Because you'd have to go to Oates. You have to go past Oates and... there's no way you can cross Oates. Oates is loaded with those brain suckers. Like any town for that matter. Towns are like motherfucking, brain sucker incubators or something. Well, maybe I can go around. That's why there is no way getting around it, okay? Not to the south, not to the north. It just can't be done. Are you sure? I mean I have to get there, I have to try. You're not hearing me, are you? I thought you were the-- the scientist. You can't get there. Too far away, too many towns. I have to, you don't understand. I've been studying this virus for the last few weeks. There's a possibility that the effects can be reversed. Reverse the virus? what are you talking about? So about two months ago we had the first case. You know the thaw, right? The ice is melting. Well, some prehistoric remains were discovered in Antarctica and there was a scientific investigation, some of the best scientists in the world went out there to study these remains. And they must have come into contact with something. Some virus latent able to withstand extremely cold temperatures. Yeah, you're telling me your scientists are responsible for us getting our brains sucked out. Is that what you're saying? This is... Why does this surprise me? Uh? I'm saying the virus was exposed because the ice is melting. Listen, what's important is... You need to know it's spread by bodily fluids and it can control anything with a central nervous system. Even if the heart stops beating. Yeah, and it starts with the bleeding. From the eyes and the mouth and the nose and these burning. temperatures and violent aggression and uncontrollable hunger. Even if the heart stops beating, that's just messed up. I know how it sounds, but you've seen it for yourself. You know, I've just about had enough of this crap, and of you, to be honest. You're not listening to me, I need to get to Baxton. The samples from the original-- Too dangerous. They're in the lab in Baxton, I could cure these monsters, please. Shut up! I tell you what we can do. My cabin's right on the other side of the mountain. I can get you so far, and there's about a day's walk to Baxton. I'll show you some paths. But I'm telling you it's suicide. Anyway, you gotta stay away from towns, okay? Towns are death, baby. Towns are death. And that's it. Why won't you listen to me? I can stop this. Yeah, well good luck with that, miss. I ain't going with you. My name is Allyson. Yeah, well, I ain't going with you, Allyson. You really are a pain in the ass. All right, if you are coming with me there are two rules. Rule number one: don't piss me off. Rule number two: watch out for the skinny ones. Those are some really sneaky little fuckers. They are extremely sensitive to any kind of... visual and auditory stimuli. In other words, you make any kind of noise... you got them on your ass. Are we clear? Good. [roars] What is that? What the fuck are they doing? They are eating that animal alive. Are they human? Are they smelling us? Like wild wolves. [gun fire] [roars] Let's go. Don't you care that this is happening everywhere? We're talking about the extinction of the human race here. Why should we care? Does anyone you cross on the street give a fuck whether we live or die? Adapt and survive, that's my motto. Except I'm not fucking boy scout. And you're not worried that there are living dead people everywhere. What difference does it make? At least they are not spreading shit on social media and taking selfies. Humanity has gone to hell long ago but we were too busy to notice. Please, you have to help me. No way. But if you help me we could change things. Well, maybe, but what for? What do you mean what for? A society that doesn't take care of its own is doomed to extinction. Where there are no values there's no future. You really have no faith in humanity, do you? Surely there's something worth saving, someone. Yeah, who do you want to save, huh? Let's hear it. What? People that slap you down for no reason. Morons that think they're better than you because they have a doctor's title. Rich fucks that spend their money on bullshit. while half the world are starving to death. And what motherfucking rose-covered planet have you been living on? Because on mine there's nothing but crap. There are people worth living for, people worth fighting for. Don't you have a family? Yeah, sure, an ex-wife and alimony to pay. And you don't care about anyone? Do they care about me? I don't know but I'd do anything to protect my family. Let me give you a last piece of advice: don't get your hopes up for humanity. You might save yourself from a major disappointment. Look. An old mining town. Well, maybe there's a phone or water or a car, something. Yeah, a fountain of champagne, hmm. Why didn't I think of that? I'm so glad I brought you with me. That's probably the reason why you earn the big bucks. Looks clear. It all seems so deserted here. What do you think happened? I don't know but it sure is dead now. Okay, let's go. - Wait. - What? Can we rest? Please, you said it's safe. You're almost there. It's not far anymore. All right, we camp here tonight... and we go on tomorrow. You sleep over there. You rest first. I take first watch. [cry] [roars] [screams] Ah! Stop! Stop it! Sorry. Save some bullets. I thought I'd come quietly, but... It's obvious you, with your screaming you already... made a breakfast call, right? I'm sorry. I was asleep. I didn't expect-- Shh! [roars] Go, go, go! Just let them in. What? Just do it. Ah! Quick. Ah! Fuck, what is this place? A fucking trap! Thanks to you, fucking hell! I'm sorry! [roars] Sorry, won't give us shit! Fucking hell! Maybe, if we wait they'll just leave. Yeah, maybe, maybe we feed them with Big Macs! So they die of food poisoning, fucking hell! Fucking screaming like a little girl! Fucking hell! There must be something we can use. You know it's just a matter of time this door, this door's gonna give in. We're gonna be screwed. Fucking hell! This is all I can find! A fucking bottle of water! Of water! I suppose we're safe now! Huh? Fucking hell! Yeah, you cry! Yeah, fucking hell! [crying] Wait! What, you got another fucking brilliant idea of yours? Huh? What? A door? You saw a door. What? What the fuck is this? It's a drain. We got no choice. It's full of rats. There's something else down here. I really hope that was a rat. That's not a rat. [roars] Fuck! The gun, take the gun. Shoot, come on, shoot! Shoot, come on! Run! Run! Run! Come on, run! Fuck! Fuck! No! [roars] Are you coming? Are you okay? - I'm fine. - Okay. I know, listen, I want to talk to you about something. Sorry about... Sorry talking to you like that before. It's fine. I um... thank you for saving my ass back there. It's okay, you're welcome. Scott. Mm? Scott, that's my name. Okay. [shots] What was that? I don't know, but I don't like it. It could be a rescue team. Yeah, it could be anything. But maybe they could help us. Maybe not. Sir, did you receive me? We are blind. I just keep wondering if everything just went to hell, why are we risking it. Because we have a mission. What mission? I don't think there's anything left to defend. [shots] The doctor? Do we have another option? Wait, wait, wait. I don't like this. I don't like this one bit. Maybe they have phones. Jesus... Come on. Excuse me, hi. What are you doing? Jesus Christ. Hold on there, friend. Let's see what we got here. Ok, ok... Please, we have an emergency. Oh, an emergency. Oh, well look around you honey. Of course it's an emergency. the whole world's gone to shit. I need to make a call, do you have a phone? What kind of fool you take me for? Of course I've got one, here. You're welcome to try it, but the lines are all saturated. It's all gone to hell. [laughing] Yeah, me and the boy's been pretty busy since this all started. I see you've been keeping yourself entertained. Uh, we started off in town... but my friend, I don't mind telling you, we lost some good men out there, yes we did. It's hard to hear that, but you still got a good-sized group. Hell, we're thinking about organizing another raid if you want to join. Um, we're gonna have to take a raincheck on that. We got dinner plans. We need help, please. We have a mission. Oh, a mission, oh, right, yes, Sir, ma'am. Well, I wouldn't call it a mission. Forgive me though cause you two don't look like. there's many of you or is there some others. hiding in the darkness somewhere? We are the only ones left. Oh, I get it now, all those monsters scare you, honey? Ay? Those sons of bitches get you bad? By the way, you don't happen to have some water. and some extra ammo, by any chance? Oh, well, of course, anything for my new friends, hell. Come on. Come on, over here with me, come on. So tell me, what exactly is your mission, beautiful? I'm a biochemist and I need to get to Baxton. to a laboratory. I can synthesize the cure and end all this. End all this? How the hell are you going to end all this? I just don't know what to tell you. But I do know something, I'm starting to get used to survival of the strongest. Just take whatever I want whenever I want it. What? Oh, hell, I'm just kidding. Hey, oh, you should have seen your face. Fucking hell. Oh, hey, hey, we got to make out of each other. if we want to make it out alive, right? [laughing] Long live humanity, right? Exactly. Yeah. What the fuck's going on now? Well, you know the boys they've been drinking to relieve. the tension. It's been a few days of hell but what does a man want anyway? Well, a drink and a woman, but as women go there ain't too many around here, so, we have two drinks. You know what, we really appreciate your help, really, but we got to get going now. Oh, what's the rush? Ain't you going to stay and enjoy the party? Hell, the world's gone to fucked. Seriously why not enjoy what you have left? You know what, if I may... just talk to my partner for just a second. Of course, yeah. You don't mind, do you? No, of course. What are you doing? What am I doing? I need help. - You won't get it. - Why? - He can't be trusted. - Why? God! Do you need a fucking sign painted on their forehead? No, I don't need a sign I need help. You won't get it here. They seem more willing than you. You've only taken me halfway. They obviously have what I need. Okay, I owe you. I want to help you. I'm going to take you to Baxton for help, but for now let's get the fuck out of here, okay? [roars] Now. [gun shots] Fuck , run, run. [shots] [roars] Have they followed us? Shut up, man. They're very close. Unbelievable. Shut up, watch out here. [gun shots] [gun shots] [gun shots continue] Die! Why don't they fucking die? Shoot them in the head. [gun shots continue] [roars] Drop the rifle down. Down. You know one of them? Hey, captain, this one's alive. Hey, buddy. We need to know some stuff. Have you seen a woman who looks like a nerd? Yeah, man, yeah, I think so. She said she was going to Baxton. Baxton? Are you sure? I don't know, man, she said she had some sort of mission. Sir, Baxton is 100 kilometres away from the target, it's too far from the lab. It's freezing. Yep, welcome climate change... but you must have seen that coming, you're a scientist. Yeah, not a weather announcer. Bread and circuses. What does that even mean? My father used to say that. - Weird. - Never mind. Hey, for being a scientist you're not too smart, are you? I'm smart enough. You just don't know it yet. Yeah, right... Smoke and mirrors. Swings and roundabouts. What, oh, you're not smart. You're not a scientist because, I mean, you can't be. Charming. If I wasn't a scientist you wouldn't be traipsing through the forest. trying to save humanity with me, would you? Hey, you're giving yourself too much importance. You know, I'm just going to my way you're just coming along. From inside a cabin. bet you wish you were there now. Oh yeah, I love my cabin. I got my fire. I got my whiskey. [roars] [intense music] Can't you light a fire or something? That's dry wood there. I can't, that's the first thing they would see. [heavy breathing] I didn't think we'd end up like this. As a species, I mean. You still don't get it, do you? What? If the virus doesn't kill us all it's going to be world war three, Fucking climate change, or goddamn asteroid. I don't know. it doesn't matter, like with the dinosaurs. Once upon a time they walked the earth, they were like motherfucking kings of the world until universe decided to wipe them out. End of story. Now it's our turn, now it's our turn. And we fucking deserve it. We are a motherfucking plague to this planet. You have no faith in humanity, do you? Seriously. None? [giggles] Who would you save? Hmm? Say just one person. Who would you say? Like fucking Gandhi? Your father? Yeah, I would save my father. Okay? I would save my family. I would save you. What? What? You don't know what the fuck you're talking about, okay? You're a good person. You don't know me. Don't I? You don't know me, you don't talk about me, all right? You've brought me here. Listen, you're judging me about what I've done these days. Yeah, because who else would traipse across the forest through sun and snow to trying risk their lives to save humanity? That's what you're actually doing. You don't know me. You don't know what I have done. - You know nothing about me! - What have you done? Tell me. - You know nothing about me. - What have you done, tell me? I killed someone, okay? It's not enough for you? What? Who? Who did you kill? I fought in Afghanistan. I was just 25. They sent me over there. I'd never been outside my home state. They said we were there for the right reasons. Well, I shot a kid. A kid? Why? He had a grenade launcher. They said he was a target. They said I had to protect my own. But he was a child. I shot him down. He was maybe my little brother's age at the time, I don't know. I can't sleep since. All right? I can't fucking sleep since. I don't believe it. I just... [gasps] I was devastated. I had nightmares. I tried to find his family. I found the house where he lived. Nobody was there. A neighbor told me they were at their two sons funeral. They just lost their only two sons. You wanna fucking save the world. Look. What? What would you say this is? A fucking plant. To you... to me it's life. Growing out of the dead concrete against all odds. Don't you see? There's always a reason to carry on. Whatever you say, doctor... whatever you say... [music] [music continues] [suspense music] Unbelievable. We might actually make it. Thanks, really. [roars] Goddamn it. Look! - So, is it one of these houses? - Yeah. Which one? There, behind those. Over there? That's a strange place for a lab. All right follow me. Wait. This way, come on. We need a vehicle. Hey don't worry. I'll steal this one for you. Do you trust this guy? Do we have another option? [panting] What the fuck is this place? - Shit. - What? Don't just stand there, help me. Yeah, okay. - Something behind the door. - Hold this. Hurry up. Scott, hurry up. I'm doing what I can. Scott, hurry up. Get out of the way. Okay, after you Doctor Allyson. Sara? Sara? Shut up, Jesus Christ. No fucking way this is a lab. Sara? [hit] Stop, stop. Last round. I don't have much left either. Let's go. Fuck those guys, man. I'm getting the fuck out of here. [motor starting] Ah, yes! No, no, no. Fuck off, go away. Leave me alone. You fucking bastard. Fuck you, fuck you guys. [scream] [roar] [scream] Sara? I trusted you. I trusted you. Where is she? Where is Charlie? You promised. You would look after her. You promised you would look after until the end. [roars] No, don't shoot, please. It's Sara. [cry] Mom? Charlie? Who the fuck is Sara? Charlie? Charlie? Charlie, Charlie! Charlie, are you in there? Open the door for mommy! Please! Charlie, come on. Let me in. [crying] My baby. Oh, you're alive, you're alive. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? You sure you're okay? Yeah? [laughing] I love you so much. Oh, I love you so much. Scott, Scott, wait. - Scott! - I knew it. I knew it. I knew it! What the fuck am I doing here?! Jesus Christ almighty! - Please, please. - Fuck! Scott, please. I'm sorry. Everything was just a lie. I tried to tell you but I was scared. I had to find her. You found her. Be happy. No, wait, please. Goodbye, Allyson. Where are you going? There's nowhere left to go. I fucking trusted you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please, I'm sorry. What? Thank you for saving my mom. Say something. Tell me she doesn't deserve a chance. Tell me, come on. Tell me! [roars] Go, go, go... Jesus Christ, go, go. Go, go, go. Run, run, run. Run! Scott, wait. Come on. Go away! Go away! Come on! Run! [shot] Run, run. Run, run. Fuck you! Charlie! She's there, fuckers. [gun shots] Shit! [shots] Okay, Charlie, I need you to wait here, okay? Are you okay? [suspenful music] [crying] Wait, wait! [roars] Charlie are you okay? Yeah? I'm glad to see you, Captain Canum. Me too, Doctor. Sir, did you read me? Canum? Canum, did you get it? Sir, we have the target. Come on, soldier, I don't know how much we can take. You are the only hope. All right, Sir. So, what now? Complete the mission.
