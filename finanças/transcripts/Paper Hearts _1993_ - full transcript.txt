Great-grandma eunice brought an old upright piano in a wagon... All the way from Baltimore. Every single day, she'd have three shots of Tequila and play that old upright like a demon. She died at 97. I was 6. Eunice was the first in a long line of musicians. "Great music broads," my daddy called US. Grandma played the harp. Mama was a music teacher. My oldest daughter Samantha is a pianist, and I play my sax. [Playing sax] [Knock on door] Hi. I didn't get it? I'm sorry, Mrs. Stevenson. Monday? Three days? I have to move out of the house in three days? My husband took out the loan, Mr. Brady. My husband, not me, god damn it. I'm sorry. It's-- it's out of my control. Look, Brady, this house has been in my family for 100 years, and it's all I've got. I'm sorry. It's out of my hands. [Footsteps] Wait! Wait, wait! Wait a second. Look... Brady... My youngest daughter is getting married tomorrow. My oldest daughter is coming in from New York. For Christ's sake, give me just a week, a couple of days. I am sorry. Sometimes... Life is like a... Country and western song. Now, how the hell can I tell the girls about this? [Horn honking] Hey, mama, we're here! Hello, ma! Is that you? Aah! Oh, honey! Oh! Look at you both. Imagine me. Well, come here, girls. Tell me all about it, all about it. Kat, can you get the bag? I got the bag. I want to hear it all. I want to hear about Austin state. Oh, I can't stand it. What's going on? Tell me everything. Bob let me go from the store. He fired you? Uh-huh. He didn't really have any choice. There wasn't any business. He kept me on nine months more, thinking things would turn around, and it didn't. I'm sorry. Yeah. Can I ask you something? Is it easy for you? What? Living on your own? I think it sucks. Have you heard from him? Not a word. On top of everything else, he can't even show up for his own daughter's wedding. Coward. Is there anybody else? Well, yeah. Tom. Really? Has Tom taken you out? Well... Yeah, sort of. Sort of? Yeah. I'm scared. Yes, sir! You're going to love new Mexico, darling. It's different from Texas... A lot different. How come I can't go to the wedding? Well... It's a delicate situation. It could screw up the deal, and besides... She ain't over me yet, you know? Henry! Yeah. Uh-oh. Silao. Cuchillo. Silao. Can you say that? Nope. Ma'am. Miss. I'd appreciate it a lot if you'd say real slow and deliberate-like exactly where we are. I always wanted to learn Spanish. Serious? Yes, ma'am. Dairy queen, Henry. Pay her. Oh, you ain't going to be pissed at me for just looking? It don't mean nothing. My eyes just sort of slip sometimes. Besides, darling, you light my fire. Nobody else. Ain't no teenybopper waitress going to hold a candle to you. I'm telling you. Boys shouldn't play with matches, Henry. They get burned. Some famous male writer once wrote, "you can't sleep with all the women in the world, but you must try." Pretty much sums up the attitude of every man I've ever known... Except for my daddy. Tom. How are you? I won't be able to make it to the wedding. I got a blm meeting I can't get out of. It's o.K. I got to admit I was kind of looking forward to seeing you all dressed up. Well... You know, they don't make them like this anymore, Wesley. This has metal in it, real metal. None of that plastic shit. Henry drove it for years. No trouble at all. Of course, it could use, uh... A good wax job. Come on, get in. What do you think of the chrome? Art deco. Look at this. Radio works. You got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 A.M. stations. And, uh... For your cigarettes or your cigar, lookie here. Of course, you know, you got to have the car going, and, uh, here's my favorite part. Ready? You know, these big old American cars are worth a lot of money nowadays. I got to tell you something. I do have another buyer, but I'd really like to see you get it. Mm-hmm. Well, I'm finally going to get rid of that mess. [Thunder] I hope it don't rain tonight. Yeah, the wedding. No. The roof-- leaks like a sieve. [Knock on door] Who's that? Coming. Bill. Mrs. Stevenson. Um, is Samantha here? Samantha. Uh... I'm sorry, bill. I thought she was here. She must have gone for a walk. I'll tell her you came by. Uh...o.k. Ma'am. I'm so proud of you... Your accomplishments, Juilliard, your hard work, your talent. I want you to know there will always be something here for you. This is your home, Samantha, and bill is a good man. Oh. What is a good man, mama? [Screen door creaks] Hey. How's the groom? He's... Scareder than shit. Open it up. Oh, mama. Grandma's necklace? Look, Sam. I think I will have that glass of wine. To your happiness. Thank you, mama. Salud. * from her arms I wandered * * far across the sea * I often heard her gentle words * * haunting me * come back, amigo come on, Sam. Come on. Get down here, girl. * to the land of enchantment * * new Mexico * run back, amigo * no matter where you go... * * to the land of enchantment * * new Mexico I met Henry when I was 18. Samantha's known bill all her life. They grew up together. When Samantha was 15, she ran away, just disappeared. Didn't tell anybody where she was going. I called all her friends. Nobody knew where the hell she was. Then two days later, I came into the kitchen, and there she was. She looked up at me and just...Smiled. I was so damn relieved to see her, but I never did ask her where she went. I certainly had my suspicions. I thought you said this was the best hotel around here. That's right, darling. It's the only hotel around. So I'm supposed to sit out here in some tacky hotel room while you're drinking champagne at a wedding? I'll bring you some cake. * I found heaven * in a Texas honkytonk * yeah, I found heaven * * heaven * in a Texas honky-tonk * what's wrong? Daddy. I just wish he was here. Let's talk about something else. You and daddy are so much alike. Please. You're just going to piss me off. Why do you have to feel that way? He's your daddy, too. He's been gone a fucking year, Kat. He's an asshole. He is not. He is, too. Is not. Is. I just miss him, and I want him to be here. [Piano plays wedding march] When Henry and I got married, he got so nervous and crazy that his feet swoled up, and he couldn't even get his boots on. God the father, god the son, god the holy spirit, bless, preserve, and keep you. May the lord mercifully with his favor look upon you and fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace, that you may faithfully live together in this life and the age to come and life everlasting. Amen. Ronnie, kiss your wife. [Applause] [Recessional plays] That was wonderful. Honey. Excuse me, Kat. Hi, Jen. I'm sorry, baby. Mama, don't. Daddy! I knew you'd come to my wedding. I wouldn't miss it for the world. I wanted to give you this. Thank you. I love you. Well, adios, amigos. Adios. Adios. Adios. Congratulations, pumpkin. Amazing, huh? I guess I did want him here for Kat's sake, but now I can't believe he had the balls to show up. Daddy. Daddy, oh, can't you stay? No, uh... I'd better not. I love you both. Daddy. He wants something. I know that. Well, I want something, too. Nice car, Henry. Well, thanks. What the hell you gonna do about your mortgage, huh? Henry! Henry! God damn you, Henry! Come on, darling. We got people waiting. Where did he go? Oh, he'll be back. You think he came back just for the wedding? Shit! Henry longworth Stevenson. When the girls were little, he'd come home early from the garage every day. I once asked him why. He said he needed to see the girls grow. We'd all squeeze into the old porch swing, and he'd just sing and sing to US. He was our moon and stars, Henry was. Why do you have to get so dressed up? This is business, darling. We want these deals to go through, don't we? What am I supposed to do while you're doing business? One of US has to wait here in case shigata calls, don't we? You know, I've been thinking this could take a day or two longer. With the hotel and the meals, it could cost US a few bucks more. What? It's just something to keep in mind. That's all. * all of my love * has been taken for granted * * I've been fair * but you've been underhanded * * I've been disgraced * but I can't bear to face it * * 'cause the truth is * my heart has been bankrupt * * I was hellbent for heaven * * but, baby, I ain't blind * * this ain't the first time * * I've been undermined * sad eyes and crooked smile * * that I remember well * now it looks like all I got * * is time to kill * you can't fool me * I see it in your eyes * thank you. * you can't fool me * I see it in your eyes... * hi. I knew it. Let me introduce myself. I'm the daughter from hell. And you? I'm patsy. You're perfect. Why, thank you. You're welcome. Would you like to come in for a Dr. Pepper? "Jen, "1 year out of 23 ain't so bad. "Couldn't forget "all them great years and great times, "so I came back. "I know you deserve better. "Let me talk to you. "Let me take care of the mortgage finally. Meet me at the longhorn." Henry. You're the oldest daughter, aren't you? Henry don't say much about you. He talks about the other one. Kat. Does he ever mention my mama? No. You know, I've been thinking of trying my hair like that. I think I'm probably a little too old for that style. You wouldn't happen to know what my father's been doing for the past year, would you? Selling Cadillacs. Right. Sold a lot of them. Had his own dealership in Dallas. Had? Well, he kind of... Overextended himself. Took a bit of a bath, but we're going right back into it. Looks like we got US a Japanese to put up the money for another dealership. Cadillacs. Nah. Mercedes. Oh. He's the best salesman I ever seen. I bet. Jen, I'm glad you could come. Whoop-de-do. So, what'll it be, beer? Don't you want to know where I've been? What did you do, Rob a bank, Henry? What? The clothes, the snakeskin boots, the Cadillac. We'll get to that. Now, uh... How you been doing? What the hell am I doing here? All right. I got the money. Sit down. Come on. Jenny. Tom. How was the wedding? It was interesting. Tom, Henry. Henry, how are you? I'm...good. Won't you join US, Tom? You, uh... New around here? Yeah. Oh, yeah? Where you from? Montana. How about you? I lived here for some time. Henry's my husband, Tom. Husband? You back? Yeah. Daughter come from New York? Mm-hmm. Samantha's here? You didn't notice? I spent some time in New York. You ever been to New York, Henry? Nope. Strange place. People don't talk there. They bark at each other like dogs. I kept thinking a fight would start. So... What do you do? I'm a stockbroker, although you probably think I'm some sort of a shit. Well, I don't know. Look, I don't know why your daddy left your mama. That's between them. All I know is that he told me he was divorced. Are they divorced? Well, thanks for the beer. You look nice... Jenny. Henry. Who was that? Where's my money, Henry? I told you I'd get it for you, and I will. All of it? All nine months of it? You're not leaving? I think so. Jen. Jen. Howdy, darling. Let go of me! Let me buy you a drink. What do you want? I don't think the lady wants to dance, amigo. Listen, Jen, I can shoot by the hotel and get the checkbook. Come on. Let me take you home. Please. Look. I know he's been seeing you for at least two years. And you didn't tell your mama? No. It would have broken her heart. Pretty stupid, huh? Want to welcome all you folks to the Saturday buffet dance at the longhorn. * your eyes shine like diamonds * * your lips like cherry wine * * figure's like an hourglass * * honey, I could... Well, look who the cat dragged in. How you been? Good. Like a beer? Please. Sure. You, uh, seen my daddy around? Uh, he left with your mama. * well, do you come here often? * * honey, what's your sign? * feel like I've known you * in another place and time * yee-haw! * it was written in the stars * * we should meet once more * but stop me if you've heard this one before * * it's gettin' close to closin' time * Henry. Smell that, manure... Sage... Mesquite? New Mexico-- ain't no smell like it. Henry. What are we doing here? We'll go to the hotel, but first I want to talk to you. There's some things I want to explain to you. Hear me out. There was a reason I left you. Oh? What was that, Henry? Sometimes it just stops. For you. And for you. No, it didn't. You know what your problem is, Henry? You're terrified of growing old. You took one look at me, lines under my eyes, crow's feet... Frown marks... Varicose veins. You started getting nervous. My god, I am a little afraid of growing old. What's wrong with that? Nothing. So am I. I just thought there was a chance we could do it together. Oh, Jen, is there any reason why we can't just be friends? Don't want to be friends. Is that why you came back, to be friends? I did want to square things with you. I thought we could do it like friends. Divorce? Why didn't you just say so before? Say what? Divorce. That you wanted a god damn divorce. This ain't easy for me, Jen. Oh, I feel real sorry for you, Henry. Jen, come on now! Who is she? She? Well... Somebody I met in Dallas. Where is she now? Now? Dallas. How old is she, Henry, 15? Or maybe you got a 29-year-old version of me. You bastard. She got money, too-- miss Dallas? Let me show you something. [Chuckles] It's yours--my prize. Prize? Yep. Well, what for, for getting the richest girlfriend? No. Let me tell you now. This is for selling 100 Cadillacs last year. That's two a week. Gm give it to me. It's nice, ain't it? That prize is worth $8,000 in pure gold if you melt it down. You think you should be carrying this around in a car? That's the only award I ever won in my life. Can I tell you something I never told you? I don't know why not. 23 years, you never did tell me much of anything. I hated fixing cars. I hated that god damn garage. All I ever thought about was buying back my daddy's brand. I've had dreams, too. Don't get me wrong. Life's been good. I've had two wonderful daughters. Kat's married and happy now. Samantha. Do you know that your daughter played town hall, and she's getting ready to do her first big solo recital? Is that right? She's pissed at you, Henry. She's very pissed. You better talk to her. Yeah, I'll do that. Yeah. I got to do that. * paper hearts * sentimental lies * love was easy * once upon a time come on! What the hell are you doing? Dance with me. Heh heh heh. Come on. * we're left behind oh. * with paper hearts * while I'm looking to these memories * * I can't help but wonder why * * love gets so torn and tattered * * still it never seems to die * * like these cards that I've been saving * * as if I needed them someday * * guess there's just a few old memories * * that I can't throw away * paper hearts * sentimental lies * love was easy you're still the best dancer I know, Jen. You're still the best bullshitter I know. Ha ha ha! Is that why we got married? Is that why we're getting divorced? Wait a minute, now. I thought you understood. I just can't move back here. It wasn't working out. Did you ever stop and think that maybe I might be attracted to a man? What are you saying? I had something, Henry. Oh, did I ever have something, three years ago. He was a young cowboy. Heh heh heh. Young? 19. How's that? That was when you weren't around much, remember? And he, uh, followed me in the hardware store, and then he followed me in the supermarket. Good-looking, hard, lean body, muscular, blue eyes, blond curly hair, and a cute ass. He drove up to the house one night, and he just sat there in his pickup truck. And I was lonely. What, uh... Was his name? Kyle. His name was Kyle. Will you sign the divorce papers? You brought them with you? Mmm. Well. Never seen you so prepared, Henry. Yes, I'll sign them. This ain't so easy for me, either. Just give me the god damn check and take me home. Can I ask you a question? Yeah. Did you love me? Oh, yeah. Jen... About the house, I was wondering what you're going to do with it. Keep it. Well, good. What's the matter? Jen, what's the matter? You son of a bitch. You came back here to just erase the entire past, didn't you? What do you mean? Don't bullshit me now, Henry. I put a lot of my time, sweat, and money into that place. Your daddy give it to me, too. You think I'm stupid? I know what you're up to. You'll pay off the mortgage with your girlfriend's money and make a quick sale. I'd split it with you. I'll let the bank have the house first. Jen. Come on. Stop. Lying son of a bitch. Jen, get in the car. No way. You're going to get your clothes dirty. Jen, come on. Let me take you home. Honey, let me take you home. Darn it, Jenny. [Wheels spinning] Jen? Jen? [Wheels spinning] Shit. Well, damn. [Piano music plays] Where'd you get that? Your mama gave it to me. I play it all the time, Sam. I think it's real pretty. So, you going to come home now, Sam? New York is my home now. Damn it. No, it's not. I got to go. Wait, Sam. Sam. I'm going. Sam, damn it. Sam. Sam. Damn it! You all right? Let me drive you home. No. Actually, Tom, i'd--I'd rather walk. If you ever need anything... You ask. I mean it. Go home, bill, please. Damn it! Look at me. You don't understand, bill. I can't stay here. What's wrong with it? People get stuck in places like this. Like me. I didn't say that. Like hell you didn't. I like it here, Sam. It's clean. People...are good. They're decent. Yeah, well... Maybe I'm an asshole sometime, but you know what? That's just as bad as anybody ever gets around here. I just have one question for you, Sam. How could you leave me without saying anything? You still love me, don't you? For Christ sakes, Sam, just say it. Just say the word. I think you should know I'm losing the house. The bank is taking it on Monday, and I'll have to move out. What happened? Your daddy and I took out a loan against the house for his garage, and when he left, I couldn't keep up the payments. What are you doing? Writing you a check. What about school? I'll skip a year. Sam, no. It's my home, too, mama. Sam, honey... I can't take your money. Mama... Are you all right? I'm fine. * let's not run anymore * we can't seem to get along * * the way we did before * silence hangin' in the sky * * sinkin' low and... Pull over! * just for the love of someone... * pull over! Well. Ha ha ha! Well, well, little girl. You've been avoiding me? Aw! Whoop-de-do! Don't I get a hug? I heard you were a big success. Yeah, I, uh... I had a pretty good run of luck. Gum? You know mama's about to lose the house. And that you're responsible. That's between me and your mama, little girl. I'm not your little girl anymore. Can I ask you a question? Why... Can't we just sit down and talk like any regular father and daughter? Jesus Christ. You're incredible, you know that? I'll tell you a little story. It's about my high school graduation. Now, that's a special night for anybody. But for me, it was really special. That night was for you. I wanted to show you that I had grown up. I wanted you to realize that all those years you didn't understand my music or my love for my music, we were both just being stubborn. I wanted so bad... Just to impress you. Make you proud of me. Well, baby... I am proud. You didn't even show up. Where were you? Dallas? You were never there, daddy. Not for me, not for mama. That's why we just can't sit down and talk like father and daughter. Maybe it's a rotten thing to say, or even think, but Samantha has always been Henry's favorite. He loved Kat... Adored her... But the way he looked at Sam, well... I knew it. Kat knew it. The whole damn town knew it. The only one that didn't know it was Samantha. [Plays piano] Mr. Brady, I cannot lose my home. It's not my decision. I can't tell you how sorry I am. [Door opens] How'd it go? All right. All right? Darling... I ain't asking her to sell the house. I can't. I know I owe you the money, but I'll have to find another way to get it. This trip's been a waste of time? No. But I thought we agreed to make this stupid trip so you could make a deal with her to sell the house. I did want to see my baby's wedding. Then she won't sell the house? No, not now. Samantha was here. Oh? Oh? Why did you tell me you were divorced? I am. We finalized it today. I can read, Henry. You weren't divorced. You lied to me. Patsy, I was. Was what? It don't matter now. It's done. What are you doing? I--i--I'm not lying. I was divorced... Technically. Now you're out on your butt... Technically. Christ, patsy, what are you doing? Me? I'm leaving first thing in the morning. But, patsy-- I'll need my money. Your money? Give me my money, Henry. I'll need a couple of bucks to get a place for the night. Sleep in the car, Henry. Oh, I thought you'd like to know. Shigata called while you were out. He signed the contract. Looks like I got me a Mercedes dealership. Now, wait a minute. That's my dealership, too. I don't think so, Henry. I need a partner I can trust. Patsy, you listen to me. You listen to me. I don't live with married men. I told you that. Now just a god damn minute. That's my dealership, too. Who sold all them cars? You're sloppy, Henry. You can't do anything. Oh, you do have one talent, I guess. I'll admit you're pretty good at it, but then I can buy that just about anywhere... Too! Oh, yeah. I understand. The hospital takes everybody's money. Oh, don't be silly. No, no. Thank you. [Knock on door] Can I call you back? Thanks. Bye. Coming! Hi. Can I come in? Have you gone out of your mind? Can I use the head? Can I get a glass of water? Yes, Henry. Jen, how come you never talk about your saxophone? You were never interested, Henry. You know what I think? I think you always blamed me for a decision you made before we even met. [Knocking to shave and a haircut] Hi. [Knocking] Where'd you get that? From my grandma. She was 1/8 apache, you know. It's pure silver. You know what the Indians say about silver? They say that silver is the teardrops... Of the goddess of love. We're going to have some new rules around here, Henry. Anything you say, baby. You get 25% of the dealership, not a single percentage point more. Just like in the contract. Any luck? Not a lot. I called everybody I could think of. Ruth gave me a check for 500. People would help if they could. Ruth said I could stay with her. Let me help you. Samantha, no. I mean it. That's that. Were you with daddy today? Me, too. He brought me papers. It's over. We're divorced. Well, I guess it doesn't surprise me. I know daddy. He never knew you, though, did he? He wanted you to be like me. Funny thing. You are like me, when I was young... Before I met Henry. You still love him, don't you? Let's go. Come on, mama. Let's go. Where? Come with me. Stop! What? Stop the car. Where are you going, mama? I'm going home. Get back in the pickup, mama. No. I can't, and I won't. Why? I can't stand the shit you take from him. I can't stand it. God damn it, wake up! Sam, wait for me. I'm coming. Wait! [Knock on door] What a surprise. Bullshit. You're not getting away with this, daddy. Hey, wake up. I got somebody I want you to meet. Mama... So she's in Dallas, huh, Henry? I'm sorry, mama. Jen, Samantha... I want to say something. Let me explain. Does he cheat on you, too? I'll bet he does, and you don't even know it. He's really good. He's excellent with the reasons. Why he comes home late for dinner, why he's got to go to Albuquerque for the weekend. Does that sound familiar? Damn you, Henry. I had your kids. I washed your floors. I cooked your meals. You threw me away like a piece of garbage, like I'm nothing! Damn you! God damn you! And damn you, too! Just-- what are you doing? What are you doing? Come on. I want you to tell me what she's got that's so great! Tell me, god damn it! You get your clothes back on right now, you hear me? I deserve to know! Tell me what have you got that I haven't got? Come on, Jen. There's no call for this. Tell me what do you have that I don't have? Money, mama. Money. It's not you. It's got nothing to do with you. It's him. So, little girl... This was your idea. You think you're pretty smart, don't you? Well, you ain't. You don't know nothing about your mama and me. You don't know what goes on between a man and a woman. What are you talking about? What about you? What have you got, a romance flat on its ass? Little girl, what right have you got to judge me? Huh... Truth is, you're just like your old man. You got dreams, and you'd do anything you got to do to get 'em. If that means hurting somebody to get those dreams... Then that's what you're going to do. Just like me. I am not like you. I will never be like you. What are you good at? What are you good at? Telling lies. You are a god damn loser. At everything! Everything! What's the matter, little girl, ain't I good enough? Who is? Get off her! Don't you ever touch her again! You don't understand, do you? I didn't mean to hurt anybody. I love you all. Here. I think that belongs to you. Thank you. Let's go, mama. Thank you. Jesus Christ. O.k... I've had it with these people. Let's get out of here. Back to reality. Give me the keys to the car, Henry. Where are you going? Give me my god damn keys. Well... Patsy... Where are you going? Patsy, what the hell are you doing? Come on now. Patsy! Patsy! [Laughing] [Laughs] All those years. What? It's like I had blinders on, just like... Your father. Didn't want to see anything that was happening. Didn't ask any questions for fear that I'd find out he was sleeping with other women. That wasn't the only thing I was afraid of, but... That's what I feared most. I fooled myself into thinking... That everything was o.K. And it wasn't. Do you know the main difference between your daddy and me? He had the guts to go for his dream, even if it was late and completely selfish... And I didn't. You're not coming? No. Can I come in? What do you want from me? It's a choice, Sam. It's a choice everybody's got to make. That's all. And you know what? You got to do it all by yourself. Why did you throw it all away? Because, uh... I was afraid, I guess. Afraid of what? I saw what my father did to my mama. And I didn't want that. I still don't want that. O.k. I am going to miss you. Oh, I want you to take care of yourself. Recital... Knock 'em dead. Hold this, mama. It's o.K., Sam. I'll be here. Goodbye, bill. I love you. I love you, too. I have a front row seat reserved for you. Maybe two. [Laughs] Bye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Do you know... This is the first time in my life I've ever been entirely alone? Without mama or daddy or Henry or one of my daughters in the house. I can't drive. I don't have money for the house. It's a little bit... Scary. It's a little bit scary. I got something for you. I'll be right out. "Dear Jen, "I owe you this. "Goodbye. Henry." Henry. What are you doing? Teach me to drive. Put that clutch in. The one on the left. Like this? Turn on the engine. Let the clutch out. Here it goes. Slow. Do I make a right? Yes. Whoa! Don't go so far. Oh, my god. Aah! Now stay on the road. Oh, my god. So the house is safe. I can pay off the bank. I can't believe it. Hell... For once in his life, Henry did the right thing, the decent thing, the first really unselfish act of his whole life. Hi. Where are you going? I'm just going as far as this road goes. It's weird.
