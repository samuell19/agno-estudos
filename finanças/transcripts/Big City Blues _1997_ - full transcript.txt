[music playing] [door closing] [music playing] -Gene. Gene. [knocking] -Gene. -It's over. Give yourself up. -Gene. Gene. Gene. [gun shot] [gun shot] -Gene. Gene. I'm so sorry. -You little bitch. [music playing] -So how was it? -I'll tell you the truth. It wasn't very good. You see it wasn't like LaLush, you know, or-- or-- or ah-- Ren-- Renoir. -Who's that? I told you a hundred times that great directors and French directors, they-- they're the best. But bes-- besides all that, the fucking film was dubbed. -So what? What's the difference? -You don't want-- when you see a French picture, you don't want to see the people speaking French. You don't want-- you know, you don't want to hear American voices and bad American actors reading the-- the mouth doesn't-- you know their mouth's are moving and the lines don't fit it. ah-- You want to see it in French with ah-- the sub-- Why do-- why do they do that? -They're probably bunch of lazy cocksuckers. -That's exactly right. Because you see, you don't get an honest day's work today for an honest day's pay. That's the problem. They're late. Have you got any dental floss? HUDSON: Might be a couple of toothpicks in the glove compartment. CONNOR: I got the popcorn You know I can't get this shit out. HUDSON: So what was it about? -Well, this broad falls in love with this guy and ah-- well, shit, you know. She turns him over to the cops. I mean she-- she-- it's not her fault. But women are like that. They can't help it. They're all fucked up. -Do me a favor. Don't even go there. All right? Don't start. -Start what? -Look, Connors, I know that you don't like Doreen. -I don't -- wasn't talking about Doreen. I'm talking about women in general. I wasn't talking about Doreen. I-- I like Doreen. -Yeah. Right. -I do. I like Doreen. I like her very much. -Right. -You know like, hair just like mine. But more, I don't know, Garbo or something. And clothes to just die for. You know all that like, designer shit, you know, like Gaultier. And uh-- what's his name, like Laguat. No, that-- a left, left. I don't know. It's like an exact fucking doppelganger, and you know. I mean it's just different hair and different clothes. Don't you just love that word? You know, it's like doppleganger, the way it rolls over. CAB DRIVER: She can't be an exact doppelganger. -Sure she can. It's like I said. -No. -It's the-- -See, a doppelganger is someone who's the same. So they're exact. Exact doppelgangers told a lot. -Hmmmm. I have a theory about exact doppelganger up ahead. It's like, they're you, it's just that they've taken a different path from you. You know, like, they-- they look like you. And they, you know, they act like you. But they're just doing different things from you. -The word is actually derived from in German, which is why I, strictly speaking, it should have one of those umlauts above the A. You--you-- you know what's weird though is that you never see one. Why is it that everyone else sees them? I mean how many times has somebody said to you, you know, I just saw someone who looked exactly like you. But you know-- -And the idea of a doppelganger comes from an old legend. See, a doppelganger isn't a real person at all. -I just-- -A soft of ghostly dude. -Why, why, why why, why don't you see it? I mean why is other people seeing it? And why the fuck do you have no fucking chance of seeing them yourself, hmm? -So if you do see a doppelganger, you're actually seeing a ghost. -I bet she's a model. I ah-- I'd like, kill for that um-- that model look you know. -I thought that was the point that you look exactly like her. -No. It's-- Ah-- The point is, she's sophisticated. You know, it's like you-- you have to be sophisticated to be a model. That's-- [dog barking] -Shut up. -Get the dog. Oh god. Oh, you're going to have to something about those things darling. I nearly wet my pants. -Oh, and look my mascara. -The dogs stay. Now, what's it to be? -Oh. Decisions, decisions. I don't know. What do you think Georgie? -Well, I was thinking maybe the Bolivian? Oh, but then again, we could do something else. -Here. -Oh. Tres chic darling. Hmm. We are moving up in the world. -I got some red ones. I got some green ones. I got some black beauties. -I'm not filling pills. -Huh-uh. -Whatever. -Hmmm. -Eeny meeny miny moe. Catch a politically correct person-- [laughter] -By the toe. If he or she wilggles let him or her go. Eeny meeny miny moe. [giggles] -The Bolivian. -Oh definitely. -Chrissie. Oh, oh Chrissie. -The Bolivian right? -Ohhh, how did she know? -My.

MALE VOICE (ON PHONE): Yeah, let me talk to Chrissie. Can you talk? -Oh, Christ. MALE VOICE (ON PHONE): Chrissie can you talk? -Yeah. Yeah. MALE VOICE (ON PHONE): Cops are on their way. You've been mad. -Oh fuck. MALE VOICE (ON PHONE): So you got to get out of there right now. They're on their I'm telling you. -How long? MALE VOICE (ON PHONE): 20 minutes. Just move. -Right. Billy? Billy? Cops are coming. Get the stuff. -Huh? Huh? Hey, Chrissie what about my fucking dope? -Forget about it. The cops are going to be here any minute. -I'm not going to fucking forget about it Chrissie. You promised me my fucking dope. -Angela relax. Give me a call in a few hours. I'll work something out with you. -Fine. But I'll be back Chrissie. CHRISSIE: Hurry up. -I-- -Ah shit. It's-- the carpet. It's hot. BABS: See, so there's this whole group of frogs all dressed up for a big Friday night party. There's Cyril and Frank and Jack. The gang. GEORGIE: How are they dressed? BABS: I don't know. It's not important. What's important is is they're all men frogs on a night out looking for women frogs. A real hetero thing. GEORGIE: Jeans? Trousers? What? BABS: Georgie. GEORGIE: Oh come on Babs. It helps to capture the mood. Please? BABS: All right. Shorts. Little T-shirts. -Heh heh. -And thongs, those tacky plastic thongs. -(GIGGLES) Jellies. -Actually you're average frog is a major sartorial problem. Imagine trying to color coordinate when your skin's green. So all these frogs show up at this party expecting it to be hopping. -Ho. Hopping. Frogs. Get it. White black, or blue. -What? -They could wear T-shirts in those colors. White, black, or blue. Those colors go great with green. -Oh you're Impossible. I-- -Gotcha. -You fucking bastard. I'm not finishing. -Oh please? -No more winding me up? -OK. -Well, anyway. They all show up at this party only to find there are no women frogs. Well, kill disaster. Tipped his melon, see? For ordinary frogs it would be. But for Amazonian tree frogs, it's not a problem. Cyril turns into Sybil. Jack becomes Jacqueline. And Frank-- -Becomes Frankie. -And a good time is had by all. -Just like that? -Just like that. Because Amazonian tree frogs can change their sex at the snap of a finger. -Is that true? -Sure. I heard about it on one of those nature documentaries. Incredible isn't it? -Depressing. Now you've got me thinking I should have been an Amazonian tree frog. -Oh Georgie. -He said there was a window of opportunity in three weeks. But if I wanted the operation, I have to decide right away. Otherwise forget it for at least six months. -Well, what does he think? -Well, he thinks I'm ready. But I just don't know. [sirens] -Let's go. COP: All right let's move it. [screeching tires] -Uh oh. -Police. Spread 'em. -And here's me thinking there's no gentlemen left in the world. -Johnny Law. Rough, ready, hard, and Long Babs. -Button it. -Oh, I don't think much of yours Georgie. How's mine? -Kell disaster. -Al, Beck. Over here. -Ow. -Count your lucky stars. -Press. One star. There's two stars. Are you all right Babs? -I'm fine. But I don't know where my hat is. -Oh, I think it's in the car. CONNOR: Enjoying an elevated position within the private whisper quiet surroundings, this hacienda style properly offers classic living for individuals wishing to reside comfortably while surrounded by beauty and an unrivaled address.

Clint Eastwood isn't Spanish. -No. I know he's not Spanish. But you know, the first couple of Westerns that he did, and in my opinion, my humble opinion, the very best Westerns that he ever did were done in Spain with Sergio Leone. -Yeah. I saw those movies. They were dubbed you know. -You think I don't know what Clint Eastwood's voice sounds like? What Eli Wallach's voice sounds like? -I don't care what their voices sound like. The movies with dubbed.

You should check it out. -High noon huh? -You give up? -Let's beat it man. [music playing] [car door slams] [gun shot] -Nope. -Agghh. [panting] -What's your name? -[panting] It's Gordon. -Gordon. Anybody else around here besides you and your buddy Gordon? -No. They left when they heard you coming. -Ha ha . Well, they're smart little boys and girls. Now let me get this straight. You and your buddy, you came in here. You broke in? -Yeah. Yeah. -You broke in and just squatted? -The place was empty man. -Ha ha ha. Gordon. Gordon. Gordon. Gordon. You're saying that you thought this house didn't belong to anyone? Right? Hmm? -Oh. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. -I didn't catch that. -Fuck. -I-- I-- I take that as a right. -Right. Right. -Right. -Right. -Good. Good Gordon. Here we go. -Ahhh. -Come on. Up we go. Life is a bitch Gordon. Full of twists and turns you know? Yeah. You and me in this house. Hoooo. (GIGGLES) What are the odds eh? You and me in this place. A million to one. If you'd have made one decision different, just one, we might never have met. Now, that's something to ponder isn't it? Huh? -Right. -So let's shoot roulette. Celestial roulette. That is what life is all about. Celestial roulette. Is that your radio over there? -Huh? Yeah. Yeah. -Blues. You like the blues? -Yeah. -Heh heh. (SINGING) And some like it cold. Some take it any way, any way it's sold. I'm going my barbecue. Only thing I crave. -Yeah. Of course to appreciative the blues, you have to have lived a while. You may never appreciate the blues. Now, where the hell was I? Oh yeah. Of course. Celestial roulette. Now you are pushing the balance on the old roulette table. And you have upped the ante for when we met when you broke into this house, which we both agree, you do not own. Right? -Right. -Well. Good boys. Now, if they gave out points for stupid decisions, the one that you made when you said, hey, let's break into this house, that would win the prize as the dumbest fucking decision ever made. Right? Right? -Right. And that's not the only dumb decision you made. How about the one where you decided not to go with your friends when they left? And take it. Heh heh. Topper. The topper going in was when you decided to just get the axe and beat our brains out. [three gun shots] -Shit. I'm sorry. But he was such a dipshit. VINCE: Open. You haven't had it fixed. -Well, I haven't had fucking time. I've been rushed off my feet. Now come on. -You're a naught girl, Angela. If you don't get that tooth filled soon. It'll have to come out. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. So are we going down to the farm today or what? Hmmm? -Oh yeah. Sure. [slapping] -So what does my little mooey cow got for me huh? Oh, lots and lots of milk I hope. Have you been saving it? Hmmm? You been storing it all up just for me? Ahhhh. Oh. Little mooey cow. Your titties are so big. That must mean lots and lots of milk hmmm? Oh I could just sit here all day and just-- just-- -Go on. Don't stop. Sing the song. -O-- ah-- Old MacDonald had a farm. E-I-E-I-O. And on that farm, he had a duck. E-I-E-I-O. With a-- -Quack. Quack. -Here. And a-- -Quack. Quack. -There. Here a quack. There a quack. Everywhere a quack quack. -Old MacDonald had a farm. E-I-E-I-O.

[music playing] -Hey Julie how you doing? -Oh. Excuse me. -Hey there. I'm Walter. What's your name? -Good line. Really good line. -Ah-- let me ah-- get you a drink. Here you go. Try that. It's groovy. -Groovy? -Yeah. What goes? -What goes is that I'm looking for someone who looks exactly like me except for, you know, sophisticated. You seen anyone like that? -Do I look that spaced out to you? -Are you foreign or what? -Out of sight. Out of mind. But definitely in this country. Pardon me. So this chick a friend of yours? -Nope. She's my doppelganger okay? See I-- I-- have this theory-- -That your doppelgangers exactly like you except she's on a different journey in life? How do you know that? -The famous doppelganger theory, which I've never felt strongly about. Probably because ah-- I've never seen mine. -Which is? -Normal. Because part of the theory states that rarely, if ever, do you see your doppelganger Though ah-- you-- your friends see them all the time. -Right. Except I keep seeing mine. -Spooky. But not surprising. Seeing that it's a full moon and all. Tonight's the night for spooky-- -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. -Signs. Oh. Oh sh-- Excuse me. Hey, hey. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm really not in the fucking mood OK? Excuse me. Hey. Hey. Shit. Oh. Shit. -Hop in. That's -You can't afford me OK? -You want to catch this chick or what? Get in. All right. -The-- there. You see it? There? -OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. Sit back and listen to this all right? It's the theory of the Celebs. Look, the way I figure it, anywhere you travel the world ah-- any country, wherever you go, you bump into the same celeb. -What? Like ah-- I don't know. You get off the plane. There's that celeb. I mea-- you're in line in customs. There's that celeb. I mean, you go to eat at a restaurant. And that celeb's one table over from you. -Can I have some of this please? -My celeb is-- is Fa-- Fats Domino. Good old Fats. -I wouldn't know who Fats Domino is. -Nor did I. But the way I figure it is I see a fat black guy with Fats Domino stencilled on his back hanging out with a bunch of musician dudes. Well, that's my man. -Why Fats Domino? -No idea. I don't-- He's a musician. I'm a musician, I guess. -You're a musician? -Yeah. -So what do you play? -You can't tell? -No. What do you play? -I'm a singer. -Yeah right. -Really.. I'm a singer. -Right. -Huh. I am. I'm a singer. And I'm right on the brink of stardom. Th-- This is just temporary, this van and-- -Mm-hmm. -And everything. So ah-- where'd that cab go? -Hmm? -The taxi. Where did it go? -Shit. CHRISSIE: Ehh. Ahh. Jesus. God I'm hungry. And I love Jewish food. Higher, please. Thank you. You know what? The first guy I ever met took me to a deli for a date. You want to know what I ordered? A bacon sandwich on rye. Ha. Get it? Hah. Never saw him again after that. Jesus can you believe it? Gay. What do you think huh? -Snappy. -Snappy? -Snappy. Yeah, but is it French? I want some French. Do I look like, you know, French? -Yeah. There's a French feel to it definitely. -Really? -Yeah. -Thank you. OK. [sirens] -Uhhh. You better check this out. -Huh? -There's something going down over there. -Well, I wish I could have fucking chicken dip. Excuse me. -Holy shit. -Can we get some chicken-- -It's a--it's a helicopter out there. Guns. Oh my God. Get down here. -Oh shit. FOOD SERVER: All right. ah-- whose got the chicken soup and whose got the pastrami sandwich. -Sandwich. -Uh-- Mi-- mine's the soup. Hey. Hey. You got any ground pepper up there huh? -FOOD SERVER: Do I look like your mother? Why you two down here? -Because of that. FOOD SERVER: Oh that, right. -What do you mean that, right, huh? It's a helicopter and a fucking SWAT team. What the fuck? Oh shit. I can't believe this. -You two mustn't be from around here. -So. -So I thought not. Because most folks who eat here are regulars. If they ducked under the table every time something like that happened, they'd never get a chance to sit on the chairs. See, we're between two freeways. On robbers, murderers, child molesters you name it, they come up those freeways. And they head straight down here. I mean something like this happens twice a week, minimum. Well, that's it. Show's over. Your friend can come out now. --Hmm. Happens twice a week minimum? Fucking funny lady. -That's one tough broad. So ah-- where to? [gun loading] -I'll decide where.

CONNOR: My personal feeling about settling down is that ah-- well, it's-- it's not for me. You know what I mean. But if it's something you want to do, you ah-- go right ahead. But don't expect me to cheer for you. DUNCAN: You know what I think? I think she warped your mind. I think you've lost all sense of respect for them, buddy boy. -And you are my partner. I love you like a brother. But I don't give a shit what you think of my ex-wife. I happen to be doing very well. Thank you. -Yeah. Sure you are. -I am. Well, I admit that ah-- the ex-wife was a very strong-willed person. -Heh heh. -Very strong willed. Kind of emasculated men. Crushed their gonads like pieces of fruit. But anyway. DUNCAN: Heh heh. -If I was to settle down in a place like this with somebody, I-- I--I'd feel trapped. You know what I mean? -You know, that's all well and good. I got news for you. There's going to come a time when we're maybe a little too old for this. You know, it's bound to happen. I mean we already get those to shits going Arnie up our ass right? -Going Arnie. They're dumber than a box of rocks. Come on. They're not going to replace us. -Yeah well, if it's not them, it's going to be somebody else. It's just a matter of time there pal. -You know what Phil did once? He was trying to pull a like a-- like a Starsky and Hutch thing, you know.

But you know that is trespassing. And you know that is illegal. But you already knew that. Didn't you? -[laughing] -It's funny? -Yeah. -But you know what's really funny? You come into my sanctuary. And you bring me these. [gun shots] [gun shots] -This one fires slowly. [rats squeaking] -Argh. -Where's Willie's head? Where's Willie's head? [chanting and chickens] -Ug. Ah. -OK.

Kyle. -Yes mother? -I was just wondering honey when you'd be ready. I-- I-- I don't ma. About a half hour should do it mom. -Right. I'll put the meat on then. Uh-- Will the boys be staying too? -Oh. -Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wh-- why not? -You should put some heat on down there. You'll catch your death. -Yes mom. -Half an hour then. And put the heat on. -Yes mother. [chanting] -The snake. Can I have the snake please? Damn. Jo-- Jordan ge--get the generator. JORDAN: OK boss. -Get him. [gun shots] -Where is he? You see him? -Agh. Agggghhh. Aghh. Uh. -Say ahhh. Ahh. Ahh. -I'll tell you about decisions. Real tough decisions. Actually, one very tough decision. It happened in France 15 years ago to a man called Harry. , Anyway Harry had always wanted to go to France. That was his dream. He'd mouth off about it to anyone who would listen. -Then there's the uptown on the Champs-Elysees and the Louvre, of course. That's where the got the Mona Lisa. You know, the woman with the smiley face. And-- BABS: Trouble was, after hearing him go on and on, most people were bored shitless. Harry didn't notice. -Fio, do cats come down from gay Paris. Ooh la la. Paris. Paris. It's the greatest in the world. BABS: Um--most put up with it. Because Harry didn't have a lot going for him, what with his mother dying of cancer and his sister being killed in a car crash. Of course, no one ever thought he'd actually get to France. Shit. He could hardly afford to pay for a cab ride, let alone a plane trip overseas. Then one day, a miracle happened. Harry won the lottery. First time. First time he ever bet on it. And he strikes it lucky. Now that's what I call a miracle. So there he is, on his first night in France, walking back to his hotel after a big meal in the very best restaurant. Suddenly he gets all queasy. But the only restroom around is beside a rundown cafe. Did I mention Harry was nearsighted? -No. -Well, I should have. It's important. The fact is, Harry used to wear glasses with lenses this thick. Without them, he'd be lucky to see his mom at three paces. Anyway, he gets to the restroom. Mare, the toilet's a hole in the ground. It looks like a shower. Of course, in France, this is pretty common. But not too Harry. [giggle] Harry's dreams of Paris never included restrooms like this. Are you going to eat that? -No. -So, Harry takes a deep breath and thinks, what the hell. The next half hour, he's up there experiencing every type of bowel movement known to man. -Oh my God. -This weenie dog tastes kind of funny, don't you think? -Are you going to finish this story? -So finally kell relief. It's all over. Harry reaches for the chain and pulls. [toilet flushes] BABS: Water comes gushing out of every orifice. In a panic, Harry reaches the door handle to pull himself up. Handle comes off in his hand. His head swings around. His glasses fly off his face and straight down into the hole. So the question is, what does he do? Does he leave the restroom? Sun's glasses possibly never to find his way home. Or does he reach his hand down into that hole? And I don't need to draw you a picture of what that meant. Now that's a tough decision. -That's it? -Mm-hmm. -Oh, come on Babs. Be serious. What do you think? -I think it's up to you. -Oh, that's great. Talk about passing the buck. -I can't make the decision for you Georgie. You see that? Full moon. -Oh yeah. -No. Not oh yeah. Oh yeah! -Yeah. -Don't you know the very best night for making big decisions is the night of the full moon? GEORGIE: [burps] Crap. Jesus. -Garson? Hey. WALTER: Is this it? CHRISSIE: Yeah. -Stay cool. -Yeah. Ugh. Ciao. Go. BUTLER: Mr. Morrisey will be along in a few minutes Miss Garbo. -Hmmmm. Hmmm. Hmm. Hmmm. VOICE MESSAGE: Hi. This is Chrissie. You know what to do so do it. -Come on player. Chrissie pick up the phone. Come on Chrissie. I know you're there. No? um-- OK. Look, it's me. I'm going to be there in about um-- I don't know, like, ah-- half an hour or so and hopefully you'll be there then. OK because after the night I'm having I'm kind of fucking desperate OK? -Ahh. Miss Garbo. -Hem. -A pleasure. -Heh. Charmed. Li-- listen Sandy sends her apologies. -The agency rang. -Oh they did. Good uh-- so-- -It's on account. -Right. I knew that. They-- they told you I don't do dogs right? I mean like uh-- dogs, cats, f--f--ferrets, and sort of animal that's like a definite no-no with me OK? -I don't see any animals Do you? -No. No animals. L--la--look, can we can just do this? I'm like really busy tonight OK? -Of course. -Good. So um-- what did you have in mind? Hmmm? -I want you to take all your clothes off in there. -And uh-- what's in there? -Nothing. just a school room. -Well, in that case, I'm just going to take them off right here. -No. -Look, the agency didn't say nothing about nothing special. So you can just go fuck yourself right now. -Miss Garbo, please. Here. Something to cover your inconvenience. -That room there? -Yes. -OK. FOOD SERVER: So that's six dogs, six fries, and six Cokes. BIKER 1: Seven cokes. FOOD SERVER: Right. Right. BIKER 2: Uh oh. BIKER 1: Check thunder thighs out. FOOD SERVER: 40 miles of bad road. Wow. Ha. GEORGIE: Beautiful. Look at the Adam's apple. FOOD SERVER: Leaving so soon. GEORGIE: Excuse me. BIKER 2: Say, why does a faggot like you dress like this? GEORGIE: Well, it was either this or leather. BIKER 2: Faggot. It doesn't matter what you wear. You're still fucking butt ugly. Let's see what you got under all this shit. FOOD SERVER: OK. Who's for dogs, fries, and Cokes? BIKER 2: Fucking faggot. BABS: Georgie, come on. GEORGIE: Bastards. Fuck you. you bastards. BABS: All right Georgie. GEORGIE: Fucking bastards. His hair was longer than mine. His ass was twice as big. And he's calling me a faggot. MR. MORRISEY: No. Not like that. More sexy. -Heh heh. OK. Sexy? Hmm? Sexy. MR. MORRISEY: Now talk. You must talk. -Look, it's hard to strip and talk OK? MR. MORRISEY: It's no good unless you talk. -About what? MR. MORRISEY: Anything. -OK. I have a friend. MR. MORRISEY: No! -What? MR. MORRISEY: No friend. You have to talk about you. -You said it could be about anything. Make up y our fucking mind. OK. MR. MORRISEY: Anything. Anything, yes, as long as it's about you. -O-- OK. OK. About -- about me. OK. Um-- My name's Angela. Right? And I'm 21 years old. Ah-- and all my life I wanted to be a model. OK? So-- hmm. only so far this is as far as I've got. Not that this is so very different and all of that. But you know it's like-- MR. MORRISEY: Boring. -Did you say boring? Hmm? You said boring right? Look, so far tonight's been one of the worst fucking nights of my life-- MR. MORRISEY: No you can't come in. Go back. You can't come in here yet. -Fuck you. I can do what I want. So what's it to be? You shut up or I leave. MR. MORRISEY: OK. OK. -So I've always wanted to be a model. OK? OK? Hmm? But somehow heh I just never got round to it. And then I saw her. My doppelganger. You going to as me what a doppelganger is hmm? No. Fine. Whatever. Well, I saw her. That's once in a lifetime. And she was definitely a model. I mean, no doubt about it. And tonight I realized that I could be her. I mean it's not too late. I mean it's not too late you know. MR. MORRISEY: Keep talking. Stop walking. -Anyway. It's no-- it's not tonight. Crazy. I don't know how I ended up doing this anyway. All I ever wanted was a bit of extra cash to like tide me over. Of course, ah-- I-- I'd be too old to be like, you know, a supermodel like Christie or Naomi or Linda, but it-- that's cool. I mean I'd be happy just being a-- a run -of-the-mill model. MR. MORRISEY: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes! -[snorts] Jesus. He must get through one hell of a lot of this stuff. HUDSON: Guess there's no way I can buy that house now. Goddammit, I like it too. CONNORS: Yeah.

And we've got to go and get it. And bring it back. -How the hell did he do that? -Well, it seems-- it seems that the blighter sent a fax. And then he left. And he went to the loo or whatever the fuck those people do. And then somebody came and used the phone. And then he came back and he hit, you know, the redial. And the fax went thataway. So now we got to go and get it and bring it back to him. -I'm starting to hate this English-- CONNORS: Back. BABS: Oh, damn. She's not here. GEORGIE: Oh. BABS: Kel de marge. Let's go.
