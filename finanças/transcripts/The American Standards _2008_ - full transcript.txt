Thank you. - This was fun, huh? - Very much. - What? - Oh, your smile. You just remind me of someone. Who? Someone special, just as special as you. Well, I'm glad we finally got to do this. Will I get to see you again? Absolutely. - Is that your uniform in there? - [scoffs] All set. [car engine starts] [woman] Hello? Hi, sweetheart. How you doing? I was worried about you. How's Harry? Harry's Harry. He has a bad influence on you. He sure does keep you out late at night. You ready for tomorrow? [clears throat] Yeah, I am. I'm just... I'm very excited. I haven't seen the boys in so long. I hope they're happy. Banana, they're men now. They're grown men. If they aren't happy, it's their own damn fault. Well... More of this? It's a big crowd tomorrow night, throw them anywhere. [scoffs] Oh, Jack. You gave the Belmont's the whole corner? - [woman] They're noisy, so... - That's a lot of yammering. - Our table? - It's right here. You, me, the boys, Lori, Sammi. My Bry. Hmm. [gasps] Jack, did he say? Is he bringing somebody? Just relax. I mean, you're always saying you want them to come here. They're finally doing it, now you're getting all worked up over it. I'm sorry. I'm just tired. - We should get to bed. - You go ahead. I'm... I'm gonna stay up a bit. [birds chirping] Regardless, this isn't the time. Tonight. Yeah, tonight's her party. I'm not exactly in the mood to talk about this. Right now, huh? And you shouldn't be just... ...calling me without giving me a warning either. Yeah, I know, it's a cell phone but, still, she could answer. OK. All right Katie, my lady. Tuesday it is. Bye. Ay-yi-yi. - [woman] Hey. - What? Oh, hi. You just look so crazy-occupied. God, I love your eyes. Come here, sit down. tell me about it. - Oh, I will. - Ahh. - Hey, baby. - Hey, you. [sighs] Ohh... Jacky-Jack. Mom! - [Mom] Hey, you! - Happy birthday, birthday girl. - You look gorgeous. - Thank you, baby. - Where's Lori? - What do you mean? She's... not here. We already talked about that, Mom. But, here's Sammi. [Mom] Hey, you! Look at my little tomboy, I guess. Hey, where's my little Sammi-Whammi? Ah, yeah! Mmm, that feels good. You're getting big. Woof! - You hungry? Come on, I'll make you a sandwich. - Yeah. - Hey, Dad. - Hey, kid. How are you? Well, all things considered, making it. - Bry here yet? - Soon enough. He's visiting one of his clients on a tour up in New England. I told him to bring me some clam chowder. He's still doing that music agent thing, huh? Robbing people who actually have talent? Yeah, here. He... He lives a life of adventure. I'm sure he's got some stories to tell us, huh? - Yeah. - I hope he does. That's the great Bryan Jennings for ya. - [Mom] Jack? - [Jack] Annie. - What, kid? - Mom. She seems all worked up, stressed or something, overwhelmed. She couldn't even find the lemonade thing. It's right here. Well, yeah, I know. But she couldn't see it. - Sure she did. - Dad, you weren't watching. It was right there in front of her and she didn't see it. Hey, give her a break. She's all excited. We've been planning this thing forever. Wait till everybody gets there, it'll be worth it. Anyway, she's gonna be fine, just getting old. Not everybody ages as gracefully as... me! - Dad... - Stop it. You're barely here and you're already complaining. - I'm just saying... - You're here one week. One week, boy. Don't mess that up. [upbeat music playing] - [man] How'd it go? - Hell of a sweet girl. It's what you need to put a pep in your step. I see it. You look like a changed man. [Jack] I don't know how you still do it. Keeping your worlds straight. The whole time I felt like taking a nice long, hot shower. I felt slimy, you know? I, I... I just can't do this stuff anymore. Take a shower with her. She'll get you clean. You're gonna get me in a whole lot of trouble. [music continues] [chattering] [woman laughing] Which ones were these? Oh, you know. My Angel flowers. That side garden, I had the tress there and, you know, the Plumbago, that powder blue... That's a mouthful. But what's really interesting is the roots require acidic soil. I couldn't clump a lot of flowers in or it would've killed them. But you know, some things that look beautiful just don't belong together. - [whispers] Hello. - Oh, hello, darling. Your mama's dazzling us with her botanical abilities. - She's a dazzler. - I'll drink to that. You know I started cultivating this garden right before Bryan was born. [woman] Really? Mom? That's me. Not Bryan. Ladies, I think we need to refresh our drinks. Belmont Belles, to the bar. Follow me. We look so happy. Of course we do. Honey, you know, you and Lori, it's all gonna work out. I mean, if you had just invited her she might've come. Mom, no. It's over. Over is such a horrible word. Well, she did a horrible thing. She deserves it. That's it. Done. Over. When you love someone you make it work. Do you still love her, sweetie? [scoffs] It doesn't matter. You're wrong, Ronny, it does matter. You stand by those you love through thick or thin. That's what your father and I taught you. I wish that for you. Doc, really good to see you again. [Ronny] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey! Ah! - Bryan, my boy! - Just got in. Boy. you look like a million bucks, huh? Yeah. Like father, like son. [utensil tapping glass] - Good evening. Good evening, how ya'll doing? - [applause] [crowd replies] Well, you know, everybody knows I love surprises. Everybody knows my wife, lovely Ann, she likes to plan. So, there's no way of creating a surprise birthday party for her. And I'm sure coming over here she felt quite comfortable and safe. [crowd laughs] But, you know, there's always room for a proper surprise. Now, my wife loves history. In particular, she loves family history. When Annie was a little girl, her mama promised her the family keepsake. A beautiful thing. But then, when her mama passed away, it seemed to be lost forever. But no. Not for my special girl. Annie, I'm gonna need you up here. [crowd cheers, applauds] I'm not saying any more. So after searching and studying, and pleading with people for months... ...well, I got it back. - [Ann squeals] - [crowd gasps] [crowd applauds] Jack! Oh! This is the locket my mother was gonna give me. All right. Let me see. You better talk so I don't cry. [Jack clears throat] We got it. Ta-da! Now, you do wanna say something? - I think so. - OK. - I'll be quiet. - [crowd laughs] [Ann sighs] I don't know whether to laugh or cry, but... I just... Thank you all so much for coming down here tonight. It's been so lovely, I, I feel your love. I really do and I love you back. - We love you, too, Mom. - Love you, Grandma. But this guy... This guy, I love so much. - Aww... - [crowd applauds] - Let's get out of here, Jack. - See ya! [crowd laughs] - Speech! - [crowd chants] Speech! - [man] Yes, sir. - Oh... - [Ronny] Speech, Dad. - Well, all right. I thought I was going to sneak outta here and let Annie take over. But... isn't this a glorious night, huh? Here we are, all of us, all together. One, big, wonderful family. Happy Birthday to my wife. Who... hasn't... ...hasn't changed a bit. She is just as beautiful as the day I met her. And for all of you, I wanna wish one thing: that you're lucky enough to fall in love with somebody as special as her. [sighs] Home. [crickets chirping] [laughing] I'm glad that you called me. Let's me know you were thinking about me. - Mm-hm. - Are we still on for Tuesday? Oh, yeah. So... how was the party. It was nice. Nice, friends and family, that kind of thing. - Wish I had been there. - You were, in my mind. That's public life, this is private. You know my deal. You understand, right? I understand. I just want to help you relax. [stammers] I'm sorry, I... I just feel... Look, I don't want that. Come on. [Jack] He's a good kid. He is. He's just too strict... ...about making everything perfect. He's too serious. Right. Wrong. [Kate] What about his brother? [Jack] Bryan's just the opposite. Calm and cool. [giggles] Like Dad? [both chuckle] How about you? Brothers or sisters? [Kate] No, I don't wanna talk about it. [Jack] All right. [Jack] You're so much more interesting. More exciting. [Jack] Ohh... Wait for it, it'll be there. Learn what you're passionate about and do it. Life without passion... is no life at all. Then, when you have that passion, When you have that passion, excitement will follow. What? That's something I really used to live by... ...my wife and I, back in the days, not just while we were young, either. It lasted long after that. But we found ways to keep it fresh, keep it exciting. I haven't talked to anybody like this in a long time. [faint music playing] - [girl] Fine. Whatever, Mom. - [door opens] [girl] This is ridiculous. I'm going outside. [door closes] [footsteps approaching] What are you always looking at? Got a thing with stars? Astrology? Just a hobby? Is the grass wet? I'm totally gonna have a wet butt. - [groans] - [laughs] I'm Alex. You're the older boy, aren't you? Doc, right? Older? Do I look older? 'Cause I'm actually the younger brother. Although I do act older, that's for sure., but... I'm Ron. No, I was working at this hospital out in Los Angeles for the last three years. No stars in Los Angeles, I missed them. What are you doing up so late? I should ask the same of you, Big Doc. [groans] Why "Doc"? Why not Ron or Ronny or something? [sighs] My evil brother, he gave me that nickname a while back and... - ...it sort of stuck. - And you don't like it. [Ronny] Why do you say that? The way your face tightens up when you hear it. What's up, Doc? - [Ronny] It did. - Yeah. I'll call you... "Big Ron". "Big Ron"? - Just trying it on for size. - [car approaches] Huh. [whippoorwill coos] [Ronny] Good morning, Sleeping Beauty. You out late partying last night? You got nothing better to do than to give me shit? Just curious what you do out so late. I take care of my young daughter and my aging parents. No, wait, that's your responsibility. Hey, you know what? Bry's leaving today. Maybe you should too. Any juice left? What? Something is very, very wrong. Dad's staying out late, he's barely talking to Mom. You think he's having an affair? Dude... Dad? I mean, come on, Dad's cool, but... ...he's Dad. Get the cheating stuff of your head, man. Not everybody's like Lori. What, does everyone know? Did Mom make an announcement at her birthday? - I'll give you a hand. -Mucho gracias. Sure you gotta leave so soon? Party's over. What if I asked you to stay a little longer? That was nice of you. But nah. Moving on. I've got a client negotiating overseas. Another one wrapping an album. Party at NYC. As usual, Mom and Dad need you and you're not here for them. If Mom and Dad needed me, I'd be here. But... Sounds to me like you're a little more worried than anyone else. Mom and Dad are totally capable, they don't need anything from us. And I give Dad about a week before he kicks your ass out of here. [car engine starts] Bye, sweetie! I hope you like it because when I saw it in the window, I thought of you. You didn't like any one of those dresses, did you? They were too girly. - Well, you're a girl. - [car alarm chirps] They were too poufy and all that stuff. That's not what the saleslady said, she said "frilly." And there's nothing wrong with frilly. It's very femin... - [stammering] - [turns alarm on again] - [groans] Geez... - [activates alarm again] [car beeps twice, unlocks] Well, I looked like a dork in it. Put your seatbelt on young... lady. [Sammi] I know. You tell me the same thing every time. - [horn honks] - [crashing] [ambulance siren blares] [Ronny] She's gonna be OK, Dad. They're just finishing up now. She only got nine stitches. - [Jack] Stitches? - [Ronny] She's lucky, Sammi's lucky. The car got hit bad. The doctor's gonna come out in a minute and talk to you. Well, take me in there. OK, but first I want you to know she's got some lacerations. Nothing too bad, only a few were deep. - It could've been a lot worse. - Who's fault was it? - They're still figuring that out. - But she's OK, though? They're concerned, Dad. They're gonna give her some tests. - Why? - Well, they're not sure yet. But they're gonna bring in another doctor, a specialist. - Ronny, I need to see her. - [man] Coming through! - I need to see her... - Mom, right here. - Excuse me, sir. - She's my wife. - I'm sorry, sir. - Hi. [chatter on ambulance radio] [woman on PA, indistinct] [man on PA, indistinct] [woman] PET scan shows multiple area of concern. Noticeably, her drop in brain activity. This is most likely the reason for Ann's accident. I'm sorry. - Jack, I didn't see the other car. - It's OK. Mr. Jennings, may we go back to my office, please? Hold it, doctor. We don't want to wait. Can we just do this now, please? Mrs. Jennings, based on your symptoms, we recommend treatment for early on-set of Alzheimer's disease. [moans softly] It's OK. Listen, doctor, could I have a word with you outside? Now, I'm prepared to do whatever it takes. Whatever the cost. What's the solution? I mean, how do we fix this quickly? Mr. Jennings, frankly speaking, I don't know how your wife has advanced so far without medical treatment. This is not a broken bone it's not a bruise. It's not anything that can be fixed with an operation. It is degenerative. Trauma from the accident suggests rapid advancement to stage four or even five. We won't know without further assessment. This is the beginning of a very long journey for you and your family. When do I get her back? When does she return home to me? We'll be administering several days worth of tests as well as medication assessment, and for this, she will be staying nearby. You gotta realize, she has a really good life and I give that to her. And she gives me back everything I need. [Doctor] It's important to realize, Mr. Jennings, that you are not alone in this. Dad, you OK? You need anything? [exhales] Now, no one knows that your mother is here, and no one needs to know right now. You understand me? - Of course, Dad. - Hello, there. - Hey. - Doctor, I'm so pleased to meet you. I'm glad you could come. Your father told me you are pediatrician. Yes, I'm currently employed at a hospital in California, but I took some time off to be here with the family. - Oh, I'm so glad. - Yeah. - Dad, you can go in. - Mr. Jennings, your wife has been sedated. Nice view you got. This isn't how you'd like it. The color. [sniffs] The smell. We gotta get you home. Yeah. [crickets chirring] [door closes] Mom lets you smoke those in here? Mom's not here. You know, Dad, it's gonna be OK. I had my wife... and now I don't. That's never gonna be OK. - Wanna talk about it? - I want my wife back. - [snoring] - [doorbell rings] [doorbell rings repeatedly] [exhales] [groans] [Jack] Oh, what a surprise, man. Damn, I'm glad you're here. - Huh? - Ahh, Dad... Doc... Doc called, told me what's happening. We had some good times out here, didn't we? Hmm? Yeah, we did. You... taught me to ski. Little swimming. [clears throat] Senior year, skinny-dipping with Debi. Blonde hair in the moonlight. Please, Bry. Senior year? You had her out here ever since the night you met her. Splishing and splashing. Thank God you didn't get her pregnant. How'd we explain that to the neighbors, huh? [exhales] Look at this, though. What a mess. I haven't touched that boat in so long. Now this was all supposed to be finished last month, 'cause... ...we were gonna throw your Mom's party in there. Mm, mm, mm. What happened, Dad? She just doesn't come down to the water anymore. Me, I got busy with other stuff. My boy's back, huh? You can have the run of this place. Pick a bedroom, any bedroom, hmm? Give me that. Hey, hey. Look who's off the couch. Ahh, well, well. Look who it is. Hey, you guys, your mom's coming home in two days. And how about you use tomorrow and clean the place up for her? - You know, make it sparkle. - [sarcastic] Yeah. Us? Yeah. And what are you doing when you're not a boss? Oh. Well, I got something I gotta take care of. Yep. - Hey. - Hi. Aren't you excited? What's wrong? [scoffs] I can't do this. I wanted to come and tell you in person. I'm sorry. This has to end. - Why? - Come on, let's take a walk. - Wait... - Come on. - What is going on? - I'm sorry. My wife needs my full attention now. She has my full attention. I thought I gave you things your wife couldn't. - Well.... - That's what you said. - Well, things have changed. - No! - You lied to me. - I never lied! No, I didn't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - [sighs] - [car door closes] - [engine starts] - [sobbing] Jack! [exhales deeply] [birds chirping] - How about a drink? - No more lemonade, Dad. It's more scotch than anything. - Very nice. - Yeah, she's added the rest. All her favorites. - Cheers. - Cheers. Cute. Yeah, they're all right. Mmm. Which one's your favorite? Well, they're your mom's, not mine. I just went to be with her. Yeah, we used to take four trips a year. Look, she turned my wall into an expensive war map. Yeah. We haven't gone anywhere in a while. Hmm. You just don't do that. Who the hell does that? What sort of low life does that? After that many years of marriage, and then that? I'm sorry. I shouldn't even be saying this stuff to you. No. Don't be sorry. What else are late night lawn buddies for? What do I do? [scoffs] Do I tell Bryan? [scoffs] Do I confront my dad? I mean, he's amazing, but he's dramatic. If I do that, he'll never speak with me again. Just, when I think of my mom, God... If she found out, it would just kill her. [groans] - It's funny. - What? How perfect your family seems. Ha! Successful, happy, good kids, big, beautiful house, blah, blah, blah. For as long as I can remember... ...I wanted to be one of you. Feel glamorous. Be your little sister or... ...somehow, if I was lucky, even your girlfriend. Be a part of your family's magic. But... I guess perfect's something that's... ...not really real. Something that kids like me just... dream about. You know? Does it physically hurt being as smart as you are? How old are you anyways? - Seventeen? - Ding, ding, ding. Your birthday soon? - Gonna get me a present? - It's looking that way. [indistinct chatter] Mr. Jennings, her mental state is fragile. Watch her closely. She may need extra help to do very ordinary things. Also, it's important for her to feel comfortable at home. Let her relax. Just be careful with her. That's all I'm planning. Bananny! [no audio] [sobs] - [sniffling] - Hey, it's gonna be OK. - Yeah, but what if... - You're home. Everything's fine now. They're telling me we need to keep our lives as normal as possible. So, we'll do whatever you want. Maybe tomorrow we'll take a trip into town, see your girlfriends. Then come home and spend some time by ourselves. I'll make sure the boys are gone. Sound good? Yeah. Jack, the hospital said "One step at a time." Sounds like self-help bullshit to me. Well, yes and no. How they said it, yes, but, what I got out of it is - I'm home. - Right. That's one step. And then the next step is feeling like I'm home, you know? Cooking dinner, and flowers, and cleaning up afterwards. And maybe... maybe... ...parties and entertaining. [stammers] It's just one step at a time. Sounds like you got big plans. - Well, there's a reason why we get along. - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm going to bed. Oh, me too. [rock music] [chattering] [Bryan] So there I am, this hotel room in Tijuana, with this Chinese rock star, this midget, and this hooker who says I owe her money. But I don't speak enough Spanish to know why. So... [exhales] Shit. To be continued. You and your stories. Can't help it if they're popular. Speaking of unpopular, how are you? And how's Lori with her popular vagina? - That's not funny. - [chuckles] We spent almost two weeks in this hotel. Thanks. And... Just me and Sammi. It was nice. Took our time making our way down here. - [sighs] So she called? - Of course. She says she's sorry. And that she wants another chance. That it was a mistake. - [chuckles] - [scoffs] You sleep with another guy while you're married, it's more than just a mistake. - She's gotta realize that. - [groans] The drama of being a serious grown-up. [scoffs] You should try it. Being a grown-up? No, being serious. You know? Stop being Mr. Fun Guy all the time. What the hell, dude? So what if I'm the fun guy? People love me. But do they respect you? OK, Bryan, let's put it this way, what when you walk into a room and don't have a joke to tell? - What do you have to show for yourself then? - You know what? I could always do the responsible thing and go sit in the grass and flirt with a little 12 year-old, how about that? She's 17. And she's far more mature than you will ever be. And we're not flirting. Yeah. Where are you going? You're my ride. [rock music playing] Give me the Big Breakfast, three eggs, scrambled. Three slices of bacon. Grits, hash browns, biscuit. And... juice. Fresh-squeezed. Why don't you make that two, and join me? Maybe I will. I am in this smoking Versace suit, but that's neither here nor there... So the venue is a tough, tough, tough location. German crowd. Cranky. My lead singer, awesome guy, comes to me for advice. So what do I tell him? Play right to them, tease them a little bit. Make 'em think they're not gonna get it. And just then, give it to them. And he does, he rocks the house, three encores. That's my boy. Wow. That's cool. You really work with rock stars? Some of my best friends. Hmm. [loud rock music] Order on four. [Kate laughing] - That was fun. - Fun? What? So now what? I guess I could get dressed and... You're leaving? No. No-no-no-no. I forgot. Where is it. There's a spot somewhere here that I still haven't kissed. OK. - See you tonight. - [Sammi] Goodbye! I'll see you tonight. And... they're gone. It's your day. What do you wanna do with it? - Hm? - Ahh... I think I wanna do some gardening. It's been a long time. Yeah. I'll go get some gloves. - Can I join you? - I'd love that. Banana? Annie? Annie?! Annie? Banana? What are you doing? You went for a walk, huh... ...without your shoes? Oh. You know, this is just so beautiful. They're just like my flowers. They're good to me. You're good to them. I could spend the whole day here. Yep. Here I'd come home from work, find you out there, and you'd be out there till sunset. Do you know what my favorite flower is? Well... I'm sorry, I don't. You see that yellow flower over there? The yellow one? It's very deceptive. It's ground cover. It's so pretty, but it smells. And those Azaleas back there. Remember when they used to grow up along the side of Mom and Dad's driveway? Yeah. But my favorite flower... ...is a Chrysanthemum. And look at that smile. You haven't smiled for such a long time. Well, I'm happy. I'm in love. Oh, to be young and in love. I bring you down. I hold you back. Hm-mm. Never. You should be doing more things. You deserve to be enjoying your life. You know... This, right here. This is all I've ever wanted. And I'm the luckiest guy on Earth for having it. Blood? Are you? You're bleeding? You're bleeding. - Why don't you head on upstairs, sweetie, OK? - OK. - I'll be up to tuck you in in a second. - OK. Your mother was hurt today. She made her way to the park, alone, got dizzy and fell, broke open all her stitches. But she's OK now. - How'd she get there? - Walked, I guess. Well, jeez, Dad. I mean, it's... It's kind of your job to take responsibility for this. I let her alone for five minutes. Not even. [sighs] It's getting worse. She was just gone. We're gonna have to go see that doctor again tomorrow. [Ronny] Yeah. Guess we will. You look forward to our late night banter, don't you? "Banter". Good word. So what's new with my adopted family? Tell you what. Let's talk about something different. What's new with you? [sighs] Where to start? I got a thing for a boy in my grade, but I don't really think he knows it. Or if he does, he doesn't really care, so... Very intelligent, very intuitive. While he may be the same age as you, you're more like 60 years older than him. Hmm. That would explain the hurt in my hip. But... what do I do? Just give up? Give him time. It'll sort itself out. Learn what you're passionate about and do it. Life without passion isn't living at all.... Once you find that passion, excitement will follow. I promise. I've been trying to live by that motto for as long as I can remember. But when I'm actually brave enough... ...to truly live by it, I'm always happy with the results. [car approaches] Oh, boy. [laughs] It's my evil brother. I gotta go. If he catches me out here with you, he's gonna tease me relentlessly. How come? The age thing? No. He thinks I have a crush on you. Do you? I have to go. Where have you been? [laughs] Laid. I met a girl. She loves the fun guy. So what are you saying, huh? Worse? Slowly getting worse. It's been five weeks since the diagnosis. It is degenerative. How to fight it: - Stronger memory exercises... - I had a conversation with her, just fine yesterday. So now how do I know when to talk with her normally? It is a little confusing. Confusing is a good word. It's confusing for you, it's even worse for her. She sees something. She wants to do something her mind tells her she has done before. She just can't remember how or why. Expect her to be crankier. Crying fits, temper tantrum. It is a very emotional change for her. Be as welcoming as you can. Don't scold her. Don't lecture her. Just be there for her. [cheering] [seagulls calling] [car horns honking] - [hooves clopping] - [children chattering] I know you like the color. So, I brought you the ones with the most color first. You want any others and I'll bring them next time. That's no good. Huh? Our first trip, the Bahamas. Remember that view, Banana? Right from the room. Paradise Island. Great name. A couple of grand and we were right on the beach. Dinners on the water. Sunset sails. [Ann] The water. The water smelled. What? The water smelled... ...and we thought we were gonna have to take you to the hospital. That's right. Do you remember? Do you remember that? - You were so sick. - Oh, yeah. Mmm. - Round two? - Why? Do I need a reason? - Are you hungry? - Always. All right. All right, let's go. When I was young, I used to think this was how you saw your dreams. Rippling like that, magical crystal ball. Did any of them come true? I'm still here. But... on the up side... ...woke up with you this morning. Things normally move this fast for you? No. Me neither. Well, for all I know, you're probably married. - Family with a two-car garage... - Me? - ...and a white picket fence. - Absolutely not. You have a boyfriend? I was seeing this guy for a bit. - Older. - Ahh. Into older guys, huh? - Why me then? - Seriously? Yeah. Well, you've done so much. Lived life, been around the world. I lived here all my life. You take risks. I respect that. Don't let me fall in. [grunting] [groans] - [sighs] - [Ronny] Mom? Hey. How you feeling? Need some help? I don't need any help. I'm fine. Do I look that bad to you? No, no. Not at all. - You look great. - I'm just tired, honey. That's all, but I'm fine. - Let me help you, then. - No, no, no, no. No, I've got everything handled. [sighs] Mom, listen. Listen. It's OK. All right? Just listen. This is an iron. It's for clothing. It belongs downstairs next to the washer and dryer. OK? Just listen. This is juice. OK, see? This belongs in the fridge. Not the iron. Don't you waste that! It took me too damn long to make that for you, you don't just pour it down the sink. - Mom, did you forget to take your meds? - What? Your medication, Mom. Did you take your medication? Don't worry about me. I'm fine. OK? Leave me alone. [Jack] Banana, you ready to go? You see, I'm wanted elsewhere. I was gonna tell you to call her. What? What are you hearing about it? Well, they all talk. Mine talks to yours. They all talk to each other. She's not mine anymore. You miss her? Yeah, I mean. she's a sweet girl, but I've got my own. Here you go, young lady. Aren't you a dear? Perfect. - Hey, how about a toast? - Yes, do it. - [Dianne] Cheers. - To... - ...good to see you again. - [Dianne] Good times. Oh, I needed that. - [sighs] What is it? - Hmm? - What is it? - Same as always. So, Jack tells us you're looking to get back into the swing of things. Huh, huh? Jackson? You said you wanted to, I'm just trying to help. Well, yes, I do. I was going to call you the day after tomorrow. Well, that is fabulous! I would so love to get you involved again, just as soon as you're ready. What're you girls working on now? We, girls, darling. You know you are a part of the family, always and forever, always will be. Our next benefit is for the St. Charles' Children's Hospital, downtown. We're gonna have this big toy drive right before the holidays. And it's gonna be such a huge Christmas spectacular. And I want you right next to me, on my team, working side-by-side, the way we used to, you know? Remember how we were the best in fundraising... I'm sorry. I don't like it. Don't like it? Banana, this is what you always eat. So, when do you plan to start? The holidays are approaching, we've got to start as soon as possible. Well, I don't know what to say, but I don't like it. Well, OK. I'll get you something else! Don't you be violent. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Everything's fine. You love this food. Ever since I've known you, you've loved this food. Maybe you don't know me as well as you think. Don't you dare. Don't you embarrass me in front of my friends, saying I don't know my own wife. Don't you walk away from me. Is this what you want? You want to yell and shout? You want to fight? You want to cause a big scene? I want your respect. Is that too much to ask from my husband? - Don't say that. - Don't touch me! You're my wife and I'll touch you all I want. I'll love you all I want. Now, please, can we just go back and finish lunch? I... I just didn't like the food. I'll get you whatever you want. [Kate] It was on Route 40. I don't remember much. The whole car shaked. Then there was smoke. Lots and lots. That was the worst part. It didn't hurt to get hit, but... ...my seatbelt got jammed and I couldn't get out. I was choking on the smoke. My dad kept saying it was gonna be OK. [sniffles] Then I didn't hear his voice any more. - How old were you? - Eight. My aunt took me in. She's a lesbian. Not that it matters. Other than it taught me to give really awesome massages. She's a healer. I learned a lot from her. Been on my own ever since. It's lonely when you're in a world of your own. I try and... I just don't want to be alone anymore. Doubt you even know what loneliness is. Come home with me next week. There's a big dinner party planned. You'd be with me and meet my family. I won't take no for an answer. It's been far too long since you've had a family. - But she seemed to be... - Normal. Just the other day we had a perfectly fine conversation. And now over the weekend she's running around the street shouting and yelling. - That's exactly right. - [sighs] But now she seems OK. Now she seems... almost getting better. I recognize your hope. You're hoping that she still progresses. Don't let that mask reality. There are millions of patients. I have seen hundreds. People heart-broken from this, who have lost family. There's nothing I would love better than to be part of at least one survivor. But that wouldn't be realistic, at least not yet. [faint rock music] Hey, it's me. Yeah. I wanna see you tonight. I wanna talk to you about something. Oh, that would be lovely, Dianne. Great, thank you. Well, then I'll just wait inside for you. OK? All right, sweetheart, bye bye. Mom, this is Kate. Kate, Mom. She works in the town next to us at the diner. - Sweetheart, your manners, please? - Oh! Sorry. Would... would you like a Coke, something to drink? Oh. A Coke's OK, thanks. Well, Kate, let's sit down, shall we? So, you live across town? Yeah, on Sycamore. And that's where my Bry met you? He came to the restaurant I work at. - Oh, I see. You're a waitress? - [cell phone rings] - [Bryan] Hey, Jake. - Yeah. - [Bryan] Man, no. I'm excited. - [car horn honks] - Well, there's my ride. - [Bryan] Tuesday. It was a pleasure. [Bryan] Hey, first class. No other way. - [door opens, closes] - [Bryan] Hey, Kate... [Bryan continues, indistinct] [Bryan] OK, bro. - Bryan? - [Bryan] Hey, I'm coming. All right, let me run. I'll talk to you later. - Here we go... - I'm sorry. I need to go home. This was a mistake. What? I thought we had good news. You first. One of my bands was invited on the Wang-Mogul concert. It's huge. Come have an adventure with me. Now I really need to go. Hey, what's wrong? [stammers] I just... I want to go home. - Fine, let's go. - Alone. Wait a second. What's your good news? I'm pregnant. - [door opens] - Oh, my dad's home. Here, I'll take care of that. - I'll get Sammi. - Yeah. [panting] Hey! Hey, why are you leaving? - I have to go, I have to leave. - [Jack] Kate? - [Kate] Please. - Son of a bitch! What are you doing here? Whatever she told you, it's a bunch of lies. I told you to stay away! Get out of my house! - Now! Get out! - Dad! What's wrong? Bryan, Bryan, hey. I swear to God, whatever she said, it's a lie. Huh? It's not true. [ball drops in water] Oh, there he is. My son the good doctor. Have a seat, Doc. How long you been cheating on her, Dad? Oh, it's not as bad as you think. Yes! It is that bad! I know what that feels like and it's about the worst feeling ever. God! You arrogant prick! You think you know so much about life? Enough to judge me? Nah. I've always tried to be like you, Dad! Tried to be the man that you're supposed to be. Beautiful house. Family. Success! Why would you do that to her?! Why would you throw it all away like this, huh?! How could you do that to Mom? She has always been there for you. She has devoted her entire life to you. - Yeah? - Yeah! And where is she, huh?! Is she here? No! And today and tomorrow, it's gonna get worse. - And then what?! - And then... And then you live up to your responsibilities, Dad, as a man and as a husband! Especially now, when she needs you most. Instead of cheating on her. And she's always forgiven you. Always! But I don't have to. I don't have to forgive you. Ever. Ever! I've tried very hard, you know... I've failed in so many ways. I'm sorry. You have a lot of reasons to hate me. I despise you. Loathe you. But your daughter... ...my granddaughter... I look at her... I look at her and I see our whole next generation. And I want to be a part of that. Then do the right thing, Dad. For once in your life. Do the right thing! - Kate... - No, just... Don't say anything. Just go home. Sleep on it and call me tomorrow. That's not gonna be good enough anymore. I mean, if we're gonna be together... ...and we're gonna have something to show for it. - This is so weird. - This is weird. I mean, this is crazy. But it doesn't mean this isn't gonna work. I've done tons of crazy shit before. This can work. This is gonna work. [Ronny] All my life... I made decisions based on what I thought my dad would do. I studied hard in school while Bry partied. I went to med school, he went to Europe. [scoffs] When Lori got pregnant my third year of college, I got married, started a family. All so I could try and reach his... his level. So I could have my piece of the American dream, like him, you know? The irony is... ...the harder I'd try, the closer he got with Bry. The less and less we talked. Oh... I don't know. Maybe I never really knew what kind of guy he is. Maybe... Maybe your dad knew it too. He knew you didn't need him like your brother does. Maybe he saw it. Maybe he knew you're already the man he was. Now it's time for you to find your own way. Make your mark. Hey, wake up, loverboy. Let's go. Hey. You as mad as he is? Nah. I'm just here to tell you to go to hell. Do the math, Dad. I've barely known her, three, maybe four weeks. And yeah, we screwed around a lot, but four weeks? I've been poking around in there at your baby. And that is messed-up. Hey! Four weeks is enough, Bry. It could be yours. Don't you walk away from this. Is that a chance I really want to take? No. You want the easy way out, isn't that always it? I want you to admit it. What'd you tell her? I just gave her the ole' Jack Jennings. I gotta admit it, man, I lie for a living too, but you? You're a freaking genius. And her? Hook, line and sinker! Don't you say that! Ever! She's a good girl. It was just a mistake. She means nothing to you! Oh, no, no, no, no. She means so much more than that. I saw it, Dad. I saw the way you look at her! You look at her like Mom looks at her. Not with respect, with pity. The wrong girl, the wrong look. She deserves better. [both grunting] [stammers] Don't hurt him, Jack! How much did you hear? [Ann] Enough. I think we... have to decide what to do. - Yes. - Bryan's never gonna talk to me again. [Ann] I don't care. What do you want? You tell me. After all these years, there's still Jacky-Jack. I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. I've made mistakes. I know. A lot. Maybe too many, Banana. All these years... ...all the stupid things I've done. Everything I've... I've... well... Everything you've done... ...comes from your work. Everything we have, Jack. I know that. Annie... It's gonna be OK. Right. Let's speak the truth. The truth, I don't know. Truth is, I'm sure you put up with me because that's your family. You created that family. You've devoted all your time. And you've made it beautiful for everybody. But I want to tell you now: Everything that was wrong with us... Well, everything that was wrong with me, about me, I'm sorry for all of it. I'm really sorry. Jackson, this is... this is our family. It always has been. It's not as strong right now. Not us. Not the boys. But, we can make it better. - Together. - We can be strong. Yeah. Yeah, we can make it strong. Annie... ...what would you say... I mean, what would you think... What I'm trying to say is: I'd like to have Kate stay with us. - And... - [Ann] Kate? The girl? Jack! [stammers] She told me she's from Sycamore Street. How did my Bryan get to meet her over there? That's not how we raised him. Yeah, that's exactly how we raised him. Well, what would my father say? Same thing he said to me. "Do you love this girl? Yes? Well, then be happy together. Treat her well." You haven't treated me well. Now... the girl? Well, she's already part of our family. Annie? Let her stay with us and with Bryan. We'll help them. What would we tell people? We'll tell them the truth. She's carrying our family's baby. Hey, Anne? Hey. You with me? I do love you. I do love you. I love you. I love you too.
