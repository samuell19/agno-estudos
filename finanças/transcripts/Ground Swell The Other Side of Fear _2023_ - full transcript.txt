The logical thing, the sane thing, is to stay on shore. But they paddle out. Now, it's easy to understand the fun side of surfing. Grown men and women frolicking in the gentle waves of summer. But then, there are the others. What are we to make of it? In the face of an unfeeling, unthinking, uncaring force, they choose to put themselves in harm's way. It's easy to dismiss them as crazy, mindless daredevils without a cause. But yet we are transfixed. Why are we drawn to it, when we can't see the meaning amid the maelstrom? Why are we thrilled to a dance surrounded by violence? Everyone has dreams. Everyone is afraid of the dreams and a lot of people are not able to achieve their dreams because of fear gets in the middle of it. Facing fear in the eyes, and really overcoming that fear... The big challenges are always scary. But the bigger the challenge, the more it's going to help you to grow. Whatever walk of life you are from, you have your challenges and your big waves to surf. Everyone has that fear that that's holding them back, and you have to face that fear. If fear held us back, would there be a landing on the moon? Would there be miraculous life-saving vaccines? Would we have tamed fire? And would we discover the unimaginable but inevitable next? The answer is... They don't stay on land. They paddle out. Maybe the way to understand, to make paddling out part of all our lives, is to follow as a half dozen of the best big wave surfers in the world live their lives through a big wave winter around the globe. It's the season when the North Pacific and the North Atlantic pump out massive waves generated by massive storms. Perhaps the answer, the inspiration and maybe even the meaning will reveal itself. We start off our journey in Nazare, Portugal, an ancient fishing village that has emerged as the epicenter of big wave surfing in the last 10 years. It's rooted in an age old seafaring country where exploration and leaving the shore are part of the national DNA. That sailing, that ocean culture of the early explorations of Portugal is really reflecting back, here in Nazare, you know, like a man at sea. You know, a more evolved, more technological... We're exploring the world through the waves, and we are raising the flag of Portugal through our wave surfing, you know. For Nic Von Rupp, he discovered his passion for big waves while competing in small ones. Winning contests wasn't enough of a reward as he battled on the pro circuit. He thirsted for a bigger challenge. Literally. Like, I was being successful, my sponsors were backing me, like, financially was the best year of my life and... But it was really like, I was like, "Yeah, I want to be happy," you know, like, I want to do what I want to do. And that was it. I told my sponsors. I'm like, "Guys, I'm gonna focus on big wave surfing." Despite success in competition, knowing better big waves were breaking elsewhere, was too much for him. He gave up one possible career, but found another one, in life threatening, but uniquely rewarding big surf. Carrying on the Portuguese tradition of taking on the sea. Nazare embodies, the essence of this history. Where legend has it, a hunter was saved on a cliff's edge by a saint, infusing the seaside town, with a deep religious overlay, including a church, originally founded in the 14th century. In more recent times, the fishing village was known for tragic widows and special dresses telling the story of lost husbands at sea. But the same wave that caused tragedy for the fisherman, is the siren for today's pilgrims. The surfing story of Nazare, starts with one man, a struggling Hawaiian big wave surfer, Garrett McNamara, who stumbled on Nazare back in 2012. We really needed someone experienced. Uh, like Garrett, you know, at the time, he must have been 40 already, like, had tons of experience coming from Hawaii. Hawaii, was, and is the epicenter when it comes down to technologies of big wave surfing and knowledge, and safety, and so on. So bringing all that knowledge to Portugal, has really revolutionized this place, you know. This town here, this used to be a... Sorry to say, and I don't mean to offend anyone here in Nazare, but this used to be like... Ten years ago, used to be a shitty town. Everyone was broke. Middle of a crisis. Restaurants were closed. In the interim decade, things have changed. If you walk through the town, restaurants are full, people are drinking beers on the streets, you know, like, everyone's happy, everyone is making a living. Big wave, Nazare. There's people flying from all over the world to come see this place. And the truth is, the best place to see big waves is, is here. What draws surfers from nations around the world is not just the size, but the incredible, unmatched consistency of the giant surf in Nazare. Making it perhaps the best stage on the planet for facing fears and pushing boundaries. It's still a matter of patience waiting for the truly epic days. And while Nazare waits for these mega swells to arrive, this winter, the other side of the big wave world stirs to life. The swell is forecasted to hit Peahi, otherwise known as Jaws on the north shore of Maui. For tourists, it's delicious idyll. But to others, it's the ultimate test for a big wave surfer. Among them, drawn to the paddling in style at Jaws, over the jet ski assisted towing approach at Nazare, is South African, Matt Bromley. Hawaii looked like it was going into a really good pattern. And it looked like there was some big storms heading to Jaws. I kind of gave myself, like, I am going to stay in Hawaii for a month, away from my family. This is my period to get big waves at Jaws. In La Nina years, the motto is, if there is anything, you better go and you rearrange your life to chase those swells when they are there. 'Cause there might not be another one behind it. As Matt travels across the planet, he reflects back on his previous year's trip, where the wave of a lifetime, almost came true. This huge wall of water kind of just grew out of the deep. And everyone is paddling up the face, and I was sitting further out and I was in the perfect place for it. And I swung my buoy and I just thought, "If I make this wave, this is gonna be my ride, "that I've been dreaming about." I popped to my feet and this wind chop, uh, hit me and caused me to go into the air. As I landed, my foot slipped, and I landed on the side of the board, which sent my board into a bit of a cutback. And I just remember thinking, like, "Oh my gosh, this is as bad as it can get." 'Cause I could, kind of, see out of the corner of my eye, 30, 40 foot above me that lip starting to fall. And the lip landed on the tail of my board. Exploded me so hard. And it just pushed me so deep down under the water. Everyone gets scared. And big wave surfing is so scary and terrifying. But the thing is, I know all of the big wave guys, and everyone gets scared, and that everyone finds a way to deal with that fear and that challenge, because I really believe that challenges that are... The big challenges are always scary. But the bigger the challenge, the more it's gonna help you to grow if you can... If you can lean into that challenge and go surf that wave. For me, I will travel across the whole world for a swell to get one life-changing wave. That's always the goal when I go to places. It's not about getting lots of fun, good waves. It's about getting that one wave that's gonna change my life. Matt is relentlessly chasing the wave of his life, a journey that began 20 years ago at his home at the bottom of the world. There, boy. Go big or go home. Okay. See what you can do. I'll come... I'm right after you. So I am from Cape Town, South Africa, and I grew up about half an hour away from the beach and at about the age of six, my dad would take me down to the beach, like, every second weekend to surf the lot. Learned to surf waves at Muizenberg. And then it wasn't until the age of 12, when we moved to a house on the beach in Kommetjie. And it's just surrounded by big surf all around. And right in front of my house was a wave called Sunset Reef, which is one of the best big waves in the world. And I'll come back from school, I'll look out, and I see the guys towing these huge waves out there, and I knew, like, one day, I wanted to be involved with that stuff, that, that action. And the big winter swells on the other side of the bay, you can see the plumes of the explosions of water going up the cliff, off the Sentinel, which is where Dungeons is. And Dungeons is one of the most feared waves in the world. He would have to go through the progression that all big wave surfers go through. Lessons learned the hard way. My first experience of proper big waves was absolutely terrifying. I was sitting out there in the lineup and then the whole horizon just went dark and started to break. I just started to feel this fear coming over me. So I just followed the crowd and I was greeted by my worst nightmare. It's like 25 ft wall of water breaking on my head. I just find myself overwhelmed with panic and fear taking over me, my adrenaline going through the roof. I couldn't breathe properly. And I had to swim through five of these, like 25, 30-foot walls of water. And by the time the ocean settled, I was overwhelmed with fear and panic, and I was like, I'm out of here. And I actually started paddling back towards the channel to the boats, to get out the water. Shaken, demoralized, wrapped up in fear and about to call it quits, the ocean offered up a life changing gift. That's when something amazing happened. I was a little bit wider because I was paddling on my way. Another big set broke over the crowd, and I was in the perfect spot for this big bomb of wave. And something last minute just told me to spin and go and... I remember turning my nose towards the beach, and being lifted up by this what felt like a mountain. And I looked over the edge, and I took, like, two paddles and dropped in and... Just that feeling, picking up, like, speed I've never felt before, and riding this huge blue wall of water. And I rode all the way to the channel and pulled out. That was like the biggest thrill of my life. And I was like, I want to do this thing. I need to start training for this, I need to start thinking about this, and I think this is the new course that I wanna take, to be a big wave surfer. Chasing the wave of his life, Matt connects with Torrey Meister, a laid back North Shore local. I've known Matt for a really long time, and he's, he's always one of my favorite guys to chase swells with. The son of a Texas transplant, Torrey is known for charging Big Backdoor Pipeline and following in his father's footsteps. There are opposites who attract, but are bound together by the same passion. My dad was the biggest influence, as far as surfing goes. I wanted to have a surf partner, with Torrey. So it was very, very important to me to have my son be that sort of partner. And it's for this reason I showed him the ropes. When he taught me how to surf, I just became completely hooked right away. I mean, I have brief memories of telling him when I was five or six years old, like, "I want to be a pro surfer," And he's always supported me, like, since day one, you know. He's like, "You can do it." "Just, you know, enjoy and have fun." "Do anything you want." The Cold Water Classic was the, you know, the most pivotal moment in my surfing career for sure. Event was really cool. It's for uh, unsponsored surfers. So they invite 16 guys from around the world. And they pretty much let them duke it out for a sponsorship with O'Neill. And I ended up winning. And it was a... It was a really special moment for me, and it totally changed my whole career. Despite opening the door to a traditional pro career, Torrey found it unfulfilling, and turned his eyes and efforts to being a free surfing big wave rider. As the first swell of the season shows up, the vagaries of chasing waves split up the duo. Matt goes to Maui, desperate to catch Jaws no matter what. Torrey decides to stay on the north shore of Oahu, where he thinks conditions will be more favorable. At dawn, Matt is greeted by a disappointing sight upon his arrival. And looks to have made the wrong call, and won't be scoring. But the misfire on Maui is contrasted with some magic on Oahu. This particular swell, while not massive, hits the sweet spot, and is perfect for a challenging location. A legitimately heavy wave, if not a giant one, called Haleiwa. And Torrey scores, along with an all-star cast of some of the best surfers on the planet. It's one of the heaviest waves, I think, in the world, and I don't think people really realize that it will pound you like a big wave. So, it's a heavy wave. And that day was especially heavy and big and... The power and ferocity of the wave allow for high performance surfing in a high risk environment, at least for a select handful of premier surfers. Some of the best were out there tearing it up. It's great surfing, you know, with that kind of level out there in Haleiwa. Those guys are like all your friends and they are obviously pushing. Everyone's trying to get the best wave out there. I think that's super healthy for the sport, 'cause it pushes you as a surfer and as an individual. Also out that day, was Kai Lenny, arguably the best all around big wave waterman in the world. Having grown up on Maui, just down the street from Jaws, he left an indelible mark on the big wave world with a single turn, an incredible airdrop, at his backyard break. In a normal season, he relentlessly travels the globe in search of the biggest waves he can find. Pushing past fear, and redefining what's possible at places like Nazare. But this season, he's tethered closer to home 'cause his wife is pregnant, and the birth of his twins is imminent, he makes the most of the Haleiwa session. Matt is burned on Maui and Torrey is scoring on the North Shore. But for this winter season, they've enlisted the help of a liaison to their surf forecaster, Curtis Beck, a surfer himself, to be in the right place at the right time. He injects himself into what needs to happen next. I got a call from Curtis, and he just gets you psyched to go chase big waves. You know, he's like, "You won't believe it." "The waves are..." "are like 10 ft bigger." You gotta get to the airport now. And I was like... It's like sprinting up the Jaws part. I am a hype machine. Where I'm a hype machine, is trying to factor in the odds of where and when to be. There's an old saying in the surf world. "Never leave good waves." With the help of surf forecaster, Mark Sponsler, Curtis makes the high risk call for Matt and Torrey, to head to Mavericks in Northern California. It's against conventional wisdom. And with no other pro surfer even thinking about making the same call. The call was made on 24 hours' notice. Mavericks is particularly fickle, in the wind area, in local winds. and the local wind models are not the best. But when you get in like a 20, 36-24 hour window, boom! All of a sudden for this one swell, it just... It just... The wind was forecasted to disappear. You had to be willing to turn on the dime. It's late in the afternoon as Bromley heads to the airport. Torrey is just getting out of the water. If Sponsler's correct, they need to get on a flight that evening. You know, I probably surf for, two and a half, three hours or so. I remember coming in and I had like, I don't know, 20 missed calls and 40 text messages, from Curtis, like, "We're going to Mavericks." And I was like, "What, we are?" "Do you wanna go?" I was like, "Is it gonna be good?" And he's like, "Yeah, Mark, you know," says it's gonna be good. "It looks like it's gonna be." So, I was like, "Yeah, let's do this." So I literally... I think I booked my ticket, hour and a half before the flight. I barely made the flight. Luckily, I had boards and everything there. I just shoved everything into my board bags and, and got on the plane. They expected to see other surfers on the red eye flight to San Francisco, just north of Mavericks. No one else is. But anyway, everybody made it, and we got to sleep at like 02:00 in the morning. At first, it seemed the naysayers were correct and no swell is to be had. And the mad dash and red eye were a failed mission. No one else from Hawaii took Sponsler seriously. And perhaps the master forecaster, got it wrong. We got down to Mavs in the morning and they were still really small, and I was like, "Oh my gosh, there's no sign of the swell." Like, "Is it coming?" Man, it looks flat out there. In the back of my mind, I was like, I need a swell so bad. It sucked in Jaws. It's gonna suck here. It wasn't that big. Even though there's no surf, Torrey gets prepared by picking up his board. Helping on the board transfer is Curt Meyers from Power Lines Productions. Along with his partner, Eric Nelson, they are not a typical production company. But they embody the passion and commitment of the wave and surf lifestyle in Half Moon Bay. So, long story short, back in the day, I started a tv show a community access channel called Powerlines, Surf Spots. Curt had been a lifelong fan, and he saw that the show was getting stale. So, I challenged him to do his own show on surfing. Hey, are you gonna takeover or what? He wants to be the Terminator. We have the Curt Myer's Show. -Wrong. -Gotta be on Powerlines. -Curt... -You can put yourself on, you can put all his buddies on, you can put all his little girlfriends on. He'll be killing it, bro. So we joined forces. Power Lines Productions essentially was born on that... Back in the day. With world class production values, with Eric shooting from the cliff and Curt from the water, they never miss a swell or a key ride. And represent the devotion to the spot, which is the hallmark of the devotees of Mavericks. The fact is that riding waves at Mavericks can be traced to one man, and an extraordinary story. Growing up, here in Half Moon Bay, every morning I sat and ate breakfast looking at the ocean. And you could literally see Mavericks off in the right, and all the restructure out in the whole bay. Discovering Mavericks was literally from surfing as big a waves that I could around all the other reefs until depths would pop in the distance. At just 17 years old, Jeff's natural desire to push his limits as a surfer, led him to paddle out at Mavericks, by himself. Not only did he successfully surf that day, and many after, but no one else would even attempt to surf it for years. I went out there, 10 years completely by myself. After flying under the radar for years, Mavericks would finally introduce itself to the world stage in a cover story in Surfer magazine in the 1980s, and would quickly gain worldwide recognition. Most famous surf spots around the world, are shall we say, less than welcoming to any outside visiting surfers. Despite its fame, the community of Half Moon Bay has managed to keep Mavericks a special place for all surfers. One of the up and coming kids in our community, his approach to people was, is "show up and be kind." Get along with everybody and be as welcoming as you know? And he was that guy. But uh, he was out surfing and he kicked out of a wave and sat down and the board collapsed, and the lifeguards couldn't get to him before he drowned. That was his tag line. So, community basically kept it and uh, try to live it. Is that you? -Yeah. -You're a star, dog. - Wow. - Thanks. When you arrive at Mavs, everyone on the jet skis is greeting you and they are like, "Go for it." They encouraging. You get into the lineup and, and everyone is like cheering each other on out there. It's like this... I guess there's this, like, big wave brotherhood out there, and all that. It's such a rad vibe, out there. I love surfing Mavericks. Despite the unique history and welcoming vibe, Mavericks has a dark side. Having taken the lives of two professional big wave surfers, Mark Foo, in 1994, and Sion Milosky in 2011. And almost the legendary, Shane Dorian, couple of years later, after a vicious wipeout and a two wave hold down. But for Matt and Torrey, there are no such concerns, as the swell they chased is nowhere to be seen. Suddenly the ocean is stirring, and it looks like they may have made the right call, after all. Suddenly we saw this big explosion, like, "Oh, we gotta get out there." While Matt and Torrey have surfed here before, neither really has the lay of the land. Yeah. I mean, Torrey, I don't even know how many times he's surfed. I think he surfed Mavericks like twice. So, I've surfed there twice. So I was following him, but he didn't really know what he was doing. I haven't done in, like, three years, and I've only done it once. So... And it was from the left. But... we'll find a way out. This guy's from South Africa, dude, he'll find a way out. Then we paddle out around the left, out at Mavs, which is quite a spectacular view, because when you're on the left, you're looking directly into the slab and the left barrel's coming towards you. Just massive. We got out there at, like, one o'clock and was just bombing. Pristine glass, like, no wind at all. Perfect conditions. This swell was a lot bigger than I thought it was gonna be. When I surfed Mavericks of that size, my main focus is, is that left because I think there's just so much potential there. Now, you see, you know, no human beings like us, going out there and pushing our hardest to, you know, overcome our fears. When you see someone really just super passionate and not letting fear take over, and just going at it, you know, head down. I think It's, uh, it's a very motivating thing. Despite going out with dreams of a big left slab barrel, the ocean has its way of determining how things go and Torrey ends up front side. I remember just doubling up super hard, like, right on the peak. I just whipped it really fast and went. And I remember just kind of airdropping, like, "Oh, man," "this...this is uh..." "This isn't good. I better stick this time." That was probably my best wave, I ended up being right, which is kind of funny, it's like a nice airdrop and ended up sticking it and getting mowed down. And getting pretty dang close to the rocks and on Mushroom Rock on the inside and all that area. For Matt, in the past, Mavericks has been the best of times, and the worst of times. The last time I was at Mavericks, I had one of the best waves I've ever had, and I had all this confidence. And then, I paddled into this wave thinking, like, I've got this, and the whole bottom of the ocean just seemed to fall away. And I was just pushed into the depths, one of the worst beatings of my life. And that was the last wave I had out at Mavericks. And now going back out there, in the back of my mind, I'm like, "Hey, the waves are beautiful and they look friendly." But there's a chance that you could have the worst wipeout of your life. My approach is always to sit a little bit outside and try to get the biggest wave of the day. That's what I'm out here to do. This beautiful, big peak came in and it just looked incredible. When I was paddling into it, I was looking down, and it looked like it was too critical, and getting too steep. But I just thought, like, this is what I'm here for. Just gotta send it. I really believe that, challenges that are... The big challenges are always scary. But the bigger the challenge, the more it's gonna help you to grow. Everyone has that fear that's holding them back. And you have to face that fear. All the feelings of vulnerability, the anxieties, it's all part of it. And unless you face that, and move through it, you're going to remain in the smaller world. But if you face it and move through it, then you're gonna experience some of the best things, and you're gonna grow as a human being, and you're going to be able to surf that big wave. That is your destiny. It's so often, I think on the other side of that fear is where we experience our best moments. A year later, Matt has pushed past the memory of his heavy wipeout, and for a few minutes he watches Torrey, who is looking for his dream wave. Although Mavericks is famous for its right, the left represents the next frontier of the wave. And Torrey sets the standard with a deep one. I got a few lefts and then one left in particular. That was like I got a barrel on. It felt really, really fun. After an amazing first ride, Matt is feeling invincible and ready for another bomb. This wave came and moved under the pack 'cause it was a big double up. I just thought, like, "I could do this" and I put my head down. And as I stood up at the top, the bottom of the wave just dropped too quickly, and my board was, was too long and I nosedive and just, like, flung, catapulted me over the front of the board. It's this weird silence before, like the chaos is about to start because you're just getting pulled up and over in the lip, and then it took so long. And then it was just the impact was so gnarly, and so strong and just rattled and pulled in all directions. I ended up having to pull my vest because I was getting pushed super deep under the water. Came up and my board was in two pieces, I was like, "No." At most big wave spots, the other surfers would smile quietly to themselves that a force in the lineup has been sidelined. But luckily for Matt, Mavericks' special spirit reveals itself as local big wave legend, Peter Mel, who has ridden the biggest and best barrel in the spot's history, offers to share one of his backup boards. The waves are pumping still and I've got a broken board. So I went up to Pete and he was on the jet ski, watching his son John, charging. I'm like, "Pete, please, I really need this backup board." Like, "Where is it?" He's like, "Yeah, it's cool." "It's in the... It's in my van." Like, "Here, this is where the key is." And so he raced in. And thank you, Pete, for bringing down the board. Got the board, went back out and got a few more waves. Such a nice day, you know. We had, like, probably three or four hour window, and then the wind started whipping and went straight on shore, and it was done. Definitely the best big wave session that I've had this whole year by far. Yeah, we called Curtis right after and like, "Dude, thank you so much, man." It may not have been the biggest day in Mavs' history, but it was one of the cleanest days in a long time, making the red-eye trip, the right call. 72 hours, after arriving in California, the boys find themselves heading straight back to Hawaii. And with Matt's time in Hawaii starting to grow short, he's heartened by the news of a possible fresh swell, but one surrounded by question marks. Such is the life of a big wave surfer. I've got like a week left before I have got to get home to my family. And this good looking pulse of swell is coming for the weekend. Everyone's saying it's gonna be too small for Jaws. It's gonna be too windy. I knew that if there was a chance that Jaws would be going, then I needed to be out there. I needed to spend as much time out at Jaws as possible. And if there's anything happening, I've gotta be out there. Matt was just frothing to go. He's like, "I just... I'm going to go, no matter what." And I was like, "I don't know if I'm going to go, man." I think it's going to be bad. I think it will be windy and small. And I was like, "Torrey, I'm going to Jaws, bro. "Just come with me. Let's do it." And I was like, "Well, all right, "well, let's just do it." I don't know. Who knows? Maybe there'll be a couple at Jaws. Yeah, this looks... It doesn't look like there's any action, really. When we arrived, it looked like it was dead flat. And I was like, "Oh my gosh, we have blown it." I was ready in my inflation suit, ready to go. There were no waves. Somebody was on the cliff. Had been there for a while. He said he hasn't seen any waves. The swell hasn't arrived. Things don't look good. But in a replay of Mavericks, things suddenly start to shift. One of the really cool things about Jaws is when the... When the sets approaches, the lines stack up from the horizon. You just see, looks like corduroy lines. They like, stack up big These lines just started, like marching, and they just unloaded and, like barreled across the reef. Oh my gosh, it's on. I was ready in my suit. I just started running down the cliff, Torrey started getting ready. One of the most terrifying things about Jaws is the rock jump. Uh, it's these boulders down there, that are getting rolled by these surging waves. There's a massive shore break that's exploding on the rocks, and you've got to try to time it. When there's no sets, you've got to punch through this shore break and get into the deep water, into the channel. But if you time it wrong, you're getting slammed back on the rocks. Got through the shore break and I got out into the lineup. My strategy was, kind of, to just wait for one really good one. Try not to sit too close in because it felt like there might be a few bigger ones breaking further out. I looked over the edge, and it was steep, and I pulled back, and I had about four or five, I was like, "Damn, should have gone in that wave." Like, "That was a good one." Just kept pulling back. And then I saw this wave. I was like, "I'm going on this thing, no matter what." As the wave picks me up, I'm still with the thought... I'm still trying to claw my way down the wave face, even though it's getting more and more vertical. I jumped up and went down. And as I was going down, I was just suddenly like, "Wow, This wave is so windy, and so choppy." And I was like, trying to balance going over these big wind chops. At the same time, I was trying to get my line going, because the wave is going down the line. If the wave is running, there's this big wall ahead of me. As I was bottom-turning, I could see the lip already starting to fall. The only way I'm gonna make this wave is to get under the core. And I just pumped up enough under the roof of it, and, then, I was, like, in the bowl of this, like, beautiful, big wave. And then I came through and down and made it into the channel. I was, like, "Phew." Stoked. Every now and then, the sets would come in from the west, and I could see, like, way down the line up these big walls wrapping into it, where Torrey was, and I could just see him spinning and going. When Jaws is big and windy, it's literally almost impossible to paddle into a really big wave. Got a couple of good waves, and it was actually better than I thought it was going to be. So that was really nice. The fabled Maui winds start blowing even harder, and the wiser course of action is to exit. But Matt decides he wants one more. We had a few great windy waves out of, uh, Jaws. I kind of... I felt like I was really getting in the zone. And, then, I tried to send it on a pretty big one out the back. And, as I was going down the wave face, the chops were just so intense. Just bucked me off my board and I had, like, a pretty gnarly beatdown. I got up again over the fall, sent deep, I pulled my vest. The water safety guy we had organized, he came in and got me. The wind-whipped wipeout puts a period on the Jaws session for Matt and Torrey. But, for Kai Lenny, homebound on Maui with his newborn twins, it gives him a moment to reflect on big wave riding and, then, head out and grab the tow rope for a solo expression session. I have so much that I wanted to accomplish in big waves, and what better place but in my backyard? Really, the scariest thing about riding a big wave, and just as, as life is, you know, it's fear of the unknown. In order to overcome fear, you have to be able to face it, and there's just, really, no other way to get around it. But facing it is, oftentimes, less scary than just thinking about it, or leading up to it. Fear is, I think, the emotion that gets the worst rap. But, at the same time, it's the most powerful emotion. It's actually what helps you survive and overcome. 'Cause it's not conscious, in a way. It's almost a subconscious thing, and it's about honing in that fear and channeling it in the right direction. You can let it eat you up, or you can let it take you to the highest of places. When you're on the wave, everything goes quiet. You're at, probably, in that moment, the loudest place on earth. Waves are exploding. People are screaming on the cliff. All of sudden, it's just pure quiet, and it's this blissfulness. While Kai slips in sessions between diaper duty for Matt and Torrey, it's another flight. This time, back to Oahu, where a new swell promises to bring what might be the most dangerous wave on Earth to life, Pipeline. One thing is for sure, the vibe will not be the welcoming community at Mavericks, or the nearly empty, windblown lineup at Jaws. Torrey enjoys heavy local status to help him get waves in this cutthroat competitive arena, but Matt is gonna have to play politics to get his. If you take the wrong wave out there, if you drop in on the wrong person, even looking at the wrong wave, you can get beaten up. You can get sent in. Pipeline may not break the biggest, but if you measure waves in increments of fear, it's at the top of the chain, having claimed many lives on the shallow lava reef. I feel like in a wave like Jaws, you can prepare for the hold-down. You're in deep water. When that wave crashes over you, it's pushing you down into the depths, which is most people's worst nightmare. But, if you're prepared for that hold-down, you're gonna survive it, whereas, if you go to a wave like Pipeline, sure, it's, like, a lot smaller, but it's breaking in extremely shallow, uh, over shallow lava rock. And you can do everything in your control to be safe and to try to catch the right wave, but that wave is slamming you into the reef, if you're in the wrong place. There's so much energy that's converging into a very small area. The reef is very uneven, making the wave walk, and refract, and change in different directions. It's extremely unpredictable. And, if you fall in the wrong place, that wave is driving you so hard into the reef. So no amount of preparation can really help you to be safer out there. If you go on the wrong wave, and it pushes you into the reef, you're gonna be in serious trouble. If you're going head first, you can get knocked out unconscious, like, very, very easily. Pipeline is definitely the most dangerous wave in the world. And I feel just as much fear out of Pipeline that I do surfing a wave like Jaws. For Matt, this is a uniquely challenging spot, dealing with a combination of danger, and hunting for a wave amongst the locals. It was a little bit of an uphill battle, again, in the crowd. The waves were really good, but it was a struggle to get waves. When you surf a wave that's that intense, time slows down. All your senses come alive. Everything is intensified from when you're paddling into the wave, you're looking over the edge and it's past vertical, and you can see the water sucking off the reef, the bottom of the wave drops away, and the, and the top just curls over, making this huge room that you're inside of. Only have, like, two or three seconds inside that chamber, but it feels... It's one of the best feelings you can have in the whole world. Looking for a classic Pipe left, battling the crowd, and knowing the hungry reef is waiting underneath, Matt finds himself dealing with some unusual crosstown traffic. As I was paddling, I was shouting all the crew off down the line. "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm going! I'm going!" And it's really steep, so you, kind of, have to be focused on, like, on your take off. But, out the corner of my eye, I could see this bodyboarder. He was looking very interested in my wave. As I'm dropping in, I see out the corner of my eye, he's going. And I was, like, "Whoa!" I shouted, "Whoa, whoa!" I pulled up into this big barrel behind him. He, like, almost aired over me, and I, I rode through his foam trail and, then, was in this beautiful, big barrel. And he was riding in front of it, just in front of me. I shot out of the barrel and he was trying to turn off the wave. I don't think he'd even seen me. I was, like, "Oh, at least we both made the wave. We were safe." And, then, some of the photographers, they were, like, "Hey, dude, that was so dangerous, man." And, then, they sent him in. So, on my behalf, he got sent in. While localism has its downsides, sometimes, harsh crowd control also provides safety in life-threatening situations. Pipeline's the left, Backdoor's the right. And, my whole life, I've always been obsessed with Backdoor. It depends on who you ask. A lot of people will tell you it's sketchier than Pipe. Maybe not as perfect. For me, I would say, it's more of a challenge. I don't know if I'd call myself a heavy local. I think I just... I'm super passionate about the wave that I want. I think the wave that I want is this really big, doubled-up thing that doesn't look like the best wave, and, as soon as you second-guess it, it's, kind of, gone. Consistently being good, day after day, I would say, this is one of the best years I've seen in the Pipeline. It was really nice to travel with Bromley. That was definitely one of my highlights of the year, was going on some surf trips with him, and just have some good times with him, and get him hooked on country music, you know? I appreciate that. All we listened to, all day, everyday in his car was Western music, and I don't really like Western music. Torrey is one of the most polite and humble surfers that I know. He's such a nice guy. And one of the reasons why I just love cruising with him, we get on super well. Chasing the swell together was the first time we, like, properly connected, and got to hang out, like, day after day. And he's such a legend and he's an incredible surfer. For Matt, it was time to head back home to his family in South Africa. I can't wait to get home to my baby and to my wife, and yeah, reset and get ready for the next swell. At Pipeline, one of the locals who usually gets the waves he wants, is Makua Rothman, who grew up on the North Shore. But where he really made his mark is back at Jaws on Maui, having launched his career in 2003 as a 17-year-old, winning the XXL Big Wave awards with a 66-foot ride. And then, last year, topping that by getting towed into one of the largest waves ever ridden. Some say the face approached 100 feet, though he's not claiming it, and only says, "Let the ride and wave speak for themselves." This season, while certainly not hanging up his trunks, Makua decided to run for City Council and put his focus on politics. But he's also about keeping the spirit of Aloha alive globally, which led him to an extraordinary surf session about as far away as you can get from big waves. A wave pool in Austin, Texas, sharing the stoke with two champions of other sports. Honestly, when I surf here and I catch a wave, I don't think that I am in a pool in the middle of Waco, Texas. I'm on a wave surfing, regardless of what it is. And, you know, technology has, you know, given all of us the ability to surf, you know, anywhere on Planet Earth now. Once you get on that wave, you're not thinking you're in a pool, right? You're on a wave getting barreled. It's like you're at Uluwatu or whatever. - I think, it's also the people you're around as well. Yes. Yeah, the camaraderie, like, the, the group you bring to the pool, as well. -Yes. -You know, people you've come with. The, the, the, you know, you've always gotta surround yourself with good people. Makua threw down a super fun session at BSR's wave pool with none other than Formula One seven-time world champion, Lewis Hamilton, and four-time Supercross motocross title holder, Dylan Ferrandis, a fun break from politics and the even harsher realities of big waves. Oh, Lewis was charging today. He was, uh, stepping it up to the next level. They both were. It doesn't matter what I did in this pool. Like, I could have done a move I've never done before, and it wouldn't make me as happy as watching you two guys come out of the barrel with your hands up, "Yeah!" Like, that's what makes me feel good. That's the kind of stuff that I really enjoy about surfing, because I know that surfing can bring the world together. While the North Shore pumps, Bianca Valenti charges an outer reef. She is among the elite of the growing number of women worldwide taking on big waves, joining the ranks of the likes of Keala Kennelly, who has never found a drop she won't attempt, and Justine Dupont, who made history at Jaws last winter with an epic barrel. But her home break is the fabled and feared Mavericks. An extension of the embracing nature of Mavericks is how women have become accepted in the lineup. It wasn't always this way, going back to the pioneering female surfer, Sarah Gerhardt, the first female to charge the wave. I was born in LA and, then, grew up in Dana Point. Learned how to surf at Doheny Beach there when I was seven. Then, I got into big waves at UC Santa Barbara. I decided I wanted to live in San Francisco after I graduated. Started surfing Mavericks. The first time I surfed, it was in 2012. Every single time, there's a really special day out there. I want to be out there. I want to be fully present, fully ready, because every single second, every single wave, every single session out there, it's so amazing, and different, and special. You know, you have these experiences where you see your life flash before your eyes. It's an amazing place where you can learn a lot about yourself. Mavericks Surf Awards was a super fun event. I think, like, 300 or 400 people showed up at Old Princeton Landing the other night. There was just a lot of love, and it's so nice to come together with community, in celebration of the wave, because it is such a special place. There were three men's categories, three women's categories, equal prize money. Winning three awards, actually, yeah, that was pretty cool to get, you know, acknowledgement for all that hard work. Today, Bianca finds herself in the lineup, having earned the ultimate compliment, respect. And she gets her waves and has built a life and career as a pioneering female big wave surfer. So awesome, this season, seeing more women in the water, especially in Hawaii, and here, too, and to have the guys cheering us on so much. It's been fun to be a part of this, this movement that really has so much momentum right now. With his surf buddy, Matt Bromley, gone, and the waves looking flat, Torrey has another way to get his required dose of adrenaline outside of the ocean. Something that I do on the side to, kind of, get the adrenaline rush is pit bull riding. My whole family's from Texas, so, I don't know, I kind of grew up watching the PBR and been super in love with, you know, country music and the western way of life. Surfing and big wave riding may be part of the fabric of Hawaii, but it also has 150 years of history of Hawaiian cowboys. They call them paniolos. They have, like, a really cool rodeo scene over here in Hawaii. For me, I think, it's kind of the coolest, the best of both worlds, 'cause you got, you know, some of the best surf in the world, and, then, you can go get on some horses and bulls, too. So it's really special that we have that in Hawaii. You get that full, like, Aloha Hawaiian spirit as well, with, like, the cowboy spirit, too, you know, kind of mixed in with these guys. Getting on a bull is completely out of my element, you know. It's, it's the scariest thing ever to me. It's a little bit different than big wave surfing, you know? When you're out in the water, then you can kind of choose to go on the wave or not. When you're on the bull, you know, you're committed. Obviously, I know a lot more about riding a wave than I do about riding a bull. So, yeah, I'm pretty quiet when I, when I'm, you know, getting in the chute. On a rainy night on the North Shore, Torrey tests himself against 1,500-pound angry bulls. Stay. Hold on. Stay with him. Drop your legs. Drop your legs. - You okay? - Yeah. You know, feeling the power of that bull when you're getting on it. And, like, you're in the chute, and... When you nod your head to go, and you don't really know what's gonna happen, it's kind of the greatest feeling ever for me. And, um, I became super attracted to that feeling. Yeah, don't do that. Yeah, drop your legs. Throughout the evening, Torrey chooses to nod his head five times. He may not have ridden the fabled eight seconds, but faced another side of fear, then, ended the night unscathed, and with as big a smile on his face as a killer big wave surf session. The winter is winding down, but forecaster Mark Sponsler sees something very interesting pop up. Not for Hawaii, but over on the North Atlantic and aimed at Nazare, Portugal. It's good news for big wave-hungry Nic Von Rupp, but also nerve-wracking as he's still recovering from an early season injury. It's the end of the season. I bruised my ribs really hard. And I was supposed to be out of the water for a while, you know? Like, I was... I thought that was it. But, then, this swell popped up. That swell at Nazare, a lot of it was the north angle and the intensity of the storm, and the duration of it. All that just radiating and focusing right on Nazare. The swell is particularly ominous, and Sponsler is calling for something that could be historic. Going against his doctor's advice, Nic goes into full-preparation mode the day before the swell. Surfing big waves is an emotional roller coaster, you know? Like, obviously, like, when the swell pops up, there's excitement, you know? Like, "Oh, my God, it's gonna happen." Then, the media start hyping it up, like, "It's the biggest swell ever!" And, then, fear starts kicking in. And you're, like, "Oh, my God, the biggest swell ever?" I mean, I've already seen it, the biggest ever, and it was scary, you know? Like, how can I imagine it bigger? Like, everything starts kicking in, you know? And, then, obviously, you, like, calm down. You start focusing, preparing, start calling up your team. The safety team meeting takes place in the harbor. There is no margin for error. On days like this, when it's, when it's supposed to be absolutely huge... Like, we had a huge swell on January 8th. It was really big and everything went wrong. So, this swell, it was supposed to be even bigger, and we doubled up on safety. So instead of everyone doing their own kind of little, uh... tow teams, you know, of three people, we create a huge 10-people team, you know? It's really a team effort. Everyone needs to be synchronized, committed, focused. There's no room for mistakes, you know? It's just, like, mistakes, is ending up on the rocks. The dangers of Nazare are real. From being smashed in the rocks to crushed in the pounding shore break, it's easy for things to go very wrong with real consequences. The special thing about Nazare is its canyon, you know? It's, it's unique. It's like a world wonder. It's one of the deepest canyons in the world, and the way you can compare it, is to the Grand Canyon. Basically, it just catches the swell in the middle of the ocean. So the swell's coming in from the Atlantic. And what it does, all that energy just compresses to the depth of that canyon, and just shoots up with all its strength straight at the beach, you know? And, and, then, when it hits that shallow part, the wave just, like, stands up, you know? And that's how you get that mountain of water, you know? We've been talking since 6, 6:30 a.m. with the team and... Lucas said it's huge. Windy. And clean. Let's wait. I don't know, we might see that first 100 ft wave, we might not. There was definitely a hiccup in the morning. I mean, I figured out my vest had a hole. And you don't want your vest that saves your life, to have a hole, to be leaking, you know? You don't wanna be thinking about that, you know? Like, you wanna to be 100% focused and be trusting your equipment. My vest had a hole, someone took my fins... and, all of a sudden, I'm just, like, "Yo, no." I wasn't under control of the whole situation, you know? And when you're putting your life at risk like that, you want to be 100% in control. A variety of big wave surfers have arrived from across the globe to challenge the waves, including Brazilian charger Michaela Fregonese, whose young son waits nervously back home. He's scared, you know? He scared to lose me, that's why. Because do you know how danger is, so... Wait a second. This is dangerous? Oh, yeah! Super dangerous. Yeah. I don't rush because I know... anyway, that God is gonna be, like... my best wave. Like, the biggest wave of my life, for sure, today. I was praying not only for me, but for all. For all the people here. Because, if nobody hurts, you feeling more confident, you know? - If you were hurt... - It's scary, you know? If nobody hurt, everybody happy, everybody get the bomb, everything's gonna be okay. So I pray for everyone here today. One of the surfers here is Vini Dos Santos, 32, from Brazil. He's famed for catching one of the biggest paddle-in waves at Nazare. But now he's determined to make his mark by picking up the rope and hunting down a monster, and making his mark on the global stage. You know, I had some issues in the morning. The vest, the fins. But, you know, like, we're cowboys at the end of the day and we just make it happen, you know? Like, so my buddy lended me a vest, my buddy lended me some fins. -That one is gonna be a buoy? -That one's gonna be, uh... -Okay, who's gonna go on that one? -The... the other guy... For me, what really matters is the team spirit and, obviously, commitment. You wanna be out there all day. You want to catch... You want to surf big waves. You want to make the most of this. Go prepare. When I get on my jet ski, it's... That's when I, like, feel connected. It's like an extension of my body, you know? I can... I just feel that adrenaline. It's like going to war, you know? It's preparing, like, going to war. When the surf comes into their sights, Sponsler's forecast is proven accurate. It's big. The only question is, is it historically big? Big wave surfing really relates to the daily activity of anyone. Everyone has dreams. Everyone is afraid of the dreams. And a lot of people are not able to achieve their dreams because of fear, gets in the middle of it. It's exactly the same way, big wave surfing. I have the dream. I have the dream of surfing the biggest wave of my life. I'm afraid of it, of what can happen. My boyfriend, Nick Von Rupp, he's a surfer, a big wave surfer. I just have to keep believing that everything will be fine, because... ...this is a matter of life and death. The first wave, it was so choppy. I was going so fast and through those bumps, and I felt like my board was skidding out. You know, having that feeling of not being in control and, all of a sudden, you feel your fin sliding sideways, and you're holding on. Like, it gives you that snowboard feeling. You know where you're, like, trying to, like, use your edges instead of your fins. That's what it felt like. I'm like, "Oh, my God! I'm gonna eat shit right now." I went flying down, like, both arms, trying to penetrate through the water, thinking I'm gonna pull through, you know, and swim on the other side. At one moment, I think I got it. And, then, the thing just takes me down and explodes. Lucas comes up to pick me up. The wipeout was bad enough... then, things get worse. A second wave appears. It takes duck-diving a 900-pound Jet Ski with Nic holding on with one good arm to escape the maelstrom. Oh, my God, that's not how I wanna start the day, you know? I felt something was wrong, you know? But, with the adrenaline, you don't feel it, you know? You know, it was... You know, I had to take a little break and, then, all of a sudden, my arm started hurting. Like, I couldn't even hold on to the Jet Ski. But I was, like, "This is my day. "This is, like... I can't give up right now," you know? Undaunted by Nic's injury and the vibe change in the water, Michaela finds the opportunity to get the ride of her life. With a solid one under her belt, Michaela heads back out and catches what is, arguably, one of the biggest waves ever ridden by a woman. That's the best feeling ever. When you do what you love, no one get hurt, nothing, it's so amazing. As with any big wave session, there was sure to be carnage. Also cashing in his chips at the pain window is Vini Dos Santos, where things go wrong on a big one, things go wrong in a big way. The ski tries to reach him to get him to safety, but another wave rolls in, and he's left helpless and beaten up in the impact zone. In unprecedented fashion, the pressure of the wave has popped his inflation vest and the metal canister gets ripped out and starts hitting him on the head. Barely conscious, the ski driver races him to the beach. After the intense hold-down, Vini is administered oxygen on the beach. It is thanks to the well-prepped safety team that Vini is okay after a relentless wipeout. While on the stretcher, he talks about a giant wave he caught earlier. Later, looking at the footage, it reveals something extraordinary. It appears he might have ridden a record-setting wave, perhaps the 100-foot wave. The measuring of waves is as much art as science. One oceanographer later pegged this wave at 97.5 feet. Variables as to where the top and bottom of the wave are, the fact that the wave flattened out as he surfed to his right, and the incalculable distortion from the lens, leave the measurement in the eye of the beholder. History might have been made by Vini but, out in the lineup, Nic rallies to catch one more, despite bruised ribs, and literally having only one arm with any strength. It's stupid. Like, my body is telling me to stop. My... my ribs are almost broken. My arm is, like, I don't know what I have in my arm, but it's, like, I can't move it. My body is telling me to stop. Like, you know, life gives you signs. Your body gives you signs when it's enough and... But I just thought, like, whatever, you know? Like, let's just go again. And I'm getting, like, a first peaker, like, really intense, where I, like, dropped down. I ran in front of the cliff, and the thing just stood up really tall. Just magic, you know? Like, the wave was so clean, so big. I faded deep. I had that feeling that I wanted, you know? Like, in 100% control. You know, like, riding as deep as I can, pushing my limits, but in control, you know? I was writing the waves the way I wanted. We made it! Guys, thank you so much for your approach, for your confidence in my job. For me, like, it was a successful day not because I rode the biggest waves of my life. For me, it was a successful day because we are back in one piece. My ribs are hurting. My shoulders are hurting. Like, I can't even lift my arm more than this, it feels like. And I still caught, like, three waves. My best waves. Like, I couldn't move my arm. So, for me, it was, like, a... a real effort of, kind of like, pushing my limits and pushing my boundaries and the commitment, you know? Like, that's the most important for me. Oh, I got five waves. Five. Four right, and one left. Yeah, today was the biggest wave I ever surf in my life, for sure. You always feel like you could have done better, you know? I'm never satisfied. Like, I'm very driven. I always wanna do better. I always wanna progress. Not for others, but for myself. Like that's what I'm made of, you know? Like, that's what kept me in the game. That's what kept me progressing. We're still scratching the surface on what... what's doable and what's big out in Nazare. So, I mean, let's see what's gonna happen the next five years. Let's see what's gonna happen the next 10 years. Eventually it's gonna be, you know, over 100-foot. Let's see what's gonna happen, you know? And I hope I'll still be here to... to see it, you know? At the end of the day, they paddled out. Some dreams are realized and some are not. For those watching, for those riding, the lesson remains the same... pushing limits and facing fears leads to progression, leads to growth... leads to what is next. The Northern Hemisphere will go dormant. These men and women will wait. The waves will return. They will test themselves again. And we all will be inspired by their example to face our fears and push into and past the fear of the unknown in our own lives... to the other side of fear.
