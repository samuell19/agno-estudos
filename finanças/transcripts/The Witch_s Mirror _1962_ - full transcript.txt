Since the dawn of civilization until today... witchcraft and magic have existed... as well as its practitioners... magicians, sorcerers and witches. This mysterious caste... in which women are among the most devoted... includes those initiated in the boundless field... of secret knowledge known as Arcane Sciences or Occultism. They are guilty of many crimes and hideous practices. They blaspheme, they sacrifice unchristened children... they swear in the name of Satan... they kill people and have them cooked... they feed on Carrion and hanged men's corpses... they kill with poisons and spells... they cause madness... and hundreds of other horrors... that riddle the history of this damned caste. To use their diabolical powers... witches resort to special potions... brooms... skeletons of children and animals... every kind of untanned hide... flasks and vessels of every shape... secret powders and dreadful poisons... and an infinite variety of lethal herbs. All this is used by an average witch. But only a superlative witch... endowed with genuinely profound knowledge of the occult... can make use of a magical abject... of infinite powers and properties... invented by a great magician of ancient Persia. The mirror. Look. All I can see are strange figures. That... It's an evil sign, Elena. It announces doom. Look carefully at the black blot. It's an omen. Danger hovers over you. Death prowls the rooms of this house. Wait. We must discover who wants to murder you. Murder me? But why? Silence. Come. Oh Great General of The Netherworlds... almighty Satanaya... through my magic mirror... let me discover who wants to hurt my God-daughter. The Powerful Spirits have listened. But I - We will discover everything. Look. Eduardo. My husband. The man who wants to kill you. No. It's impossible. the Great and Almighty Spirits do not deceive us. With my mirror... they express Truth. But he loves me. Why would he kill me? I love him, too. It's impossible. You're wrong. Look at the mirror again. Look carefully. Who is that woman? Your rival. I don't know her. I've never seen her. She doesn't know you either. But, unwillingly, she can do you a great deal of harm. Godmother, help me. I'm araid. It's not easy. It's no easy task to change what is written. You've always helped me. And I'll continue to do so. As long as the Powers of Lucifer let me. Adonay has revealed the Truth. A deadly Truth. Death is stalking you, Elena. Why don't you play another song? - Don't you like it? - I hear it day after day. You used to ask me to play it. Perhaps. Things change. You're right. Things change. I'm going to bed. I, as your creature... invoke you to give me courage... strength and determination. I need to protect Elena... from the terrible harm coming her way. I request you declare me able enough... to prevent this evil upon the young lady... to whom I am Godmother. No one is able enough to hinder Superior Rulings. Your God-daughter must die. Don't interfere... or your Masters will punish you. I beg you... I beseech you... from my absolutely loyal heart... to protect my God-daughter... from the terrible harm she's about to suffer. Don't let her die, Adonay. Your God-daughter must die. I'll take those away. Their perfume is unbearable, especially at night. I like tuberoses, Eduardo. Are you taking them away? As you like it. What's the matter, darling? Nothing. You look very beautiful tonight. Your first compliment in a long time. Good night, darling. That milk will help you sleep better. You despise me, don't you? I've always loved you. Why are you doing this? You? Why? Almighty Spirits, Elohim... Belial and Anagaton... let me speak to Elena's soul. Elena. What? Can't you see me? I couldn't help you. You were marked by fate. I couldn't help you while you lived... but I promise to avenge your death. Thank you so much for waiting for us. This wonderful woman... is Deborah, my wife. I hope to be as useful to you as to Dr. Ramos. It will be my privilege. Thank you, Sara. Eduardo has told me so much about you. She's my housekeeper and trustworthy member of this house. She's been with me for many years. A good and loyal person. He baffles me with undeserved compliments. I just do my duty. I hope we get to be very good friends. I'd be very honoured. You must have received the telegram... - that announced our wedding. - Yes, I have. But it wasn't necessary. What do you mean? I had already anticipated. How is that possible? A man like yourself, sir... wouldn't remain single for too long. You see? Even your housekeeper says it in front of me. She knows you perfectly. Will you be having dinner? No, Sara, thank you. You may rest. A strange woman, but she appears kind. Very pleasant and very efficient. I hope you're happy here. Frankly speaking, I didn't like her at first... but I learned to appreciate her. Well, what do you think of the house? Do you like it? Very much. I was looking forward to seeing it. And I was looking forward to sharing it with you. I love you so much, Deborah. Nothing would have stopped me... from making you my wife. And you are now my wife. Your wife forever. Before, no matter what you said, I couldn't and wouldn't believe you. It would have been unfair or dishonest. You were married to another woman - That belongs to the past. Let's talk about the future, not the past. Come, I'll show you the house. I want you to get acquainted with the house. Well, all the rooms are very similar. I swear this is our room. No. It was... her room. - May I see it? - Not now, tomorrow. You're such a fool, darling. Do you think it will upset me? You know I've never been jealous. Especially now that, unfortunately, she's - I'm sorry, Eduardo. What's wrong? Nothing. But... I felt a breeze. A current of cold air held me back. The window is shut. There's no possibility of a draft in here. I may have just imagined it. Deborah. Listen. What a beautiful mirror. We can look at it another time. Come, let's go. Such a wonderful mirror. What an agreeable room. It seems like someone's caring for this room. Tuberoses were the favourite flowers of - Why won't you say it? Your wife's favourite flowers. Do you think that saying it will upset me? Don't be silly. There's no harm in the truth. Because you do love me, don't you, Eduardo? If I didn't love you... do you think you'd be my wife now? Now, tomorrow and forever. I'm sorry. We shouldn't be doing this. It's my fault. I'm acting foolishly. Will you forgive me? What's wrong? I don't know. I don't know what's wrong with me. Being in her room has upset you. This was the room you both shared, wasn't it? Perhaps. Well, I'm proud of you... for being sensitive and regardful of a past attachment. You're right, let's leave this room. - Where's Madam? - Downstairs, sir... in the dining room, waiting to have breakfast with you. - Good morning, darling. - It's rather late. Where did you get that music? It was here, on the piano. Have I done anything wrong? No. That was the favourite melody of - I promise not to play it again. But you'll have to do me a favour, too. Of course. Remember I said I wasn't over-sensitive? Well, it's not true. I realised I'm quite the opposite. I'm suffering, Eduardo... I suffer horribly each time, for some reason in this house... I'm reminded of the woman that was here before me. I promise she will never be mentioned again. Who put these flowers here? I don't know, Madam. Now listen, Sara... Regardless who left these flowers... I just don't want it to happen again. I hope I make myself clear. No more tuberoses in this house. What's wrong, Madam? There's something horrible in this room. I don't see anything odd. Look, they've withered in a just a few seconds. This is absurd, impossible. Since Mrs. Elena's death... strange things are happening in this house. Especially in this room. I don't like this room, Sara. Less so after what I've seen. You'll help me change it and burn everything within. As you wish, Madam. But, will Mr. Eduardo agree? He will. I'll make sure of that. And remember, Sara... no more tuberoses. Today, the Day of Jupiter... a full moon is on the horizon... aromatic plants offer their blood and perfume... to soak the shrouds of our deceased. L, as faithful slave of your Rulings... invoke and beseech you... to allow me once again... to speak with the soul of my innocent God-daughter Elena. Thanks to our Immortal Spirits, Elena... I have been able to invoke you. I just wanted to tell you that no one... No-one can harm you anymore... and that he who murdered your body will pay for it. Revenge will fall upon the person he loves most. Do you know where my husband is? Or when he'll be back? I don't know that either, Madam. What's wrong? I have the impression that you're worrying unnecessarily. Yes, we must discuss something very important. Something of great interest to you. To me? What is it? Did you know that Elena kept a diary? Impossible. I don't understand. I placed it here, on the table... - the moment you walked in. - Calm down, you're nervous. Yes. Stange things are happening here... the disappearance of the diary... is just one more occurance. You may think I'm hallucinating. That wasn't an hallucination. You saw for yourself how the fire went out for no reason. It's reasonable that in a closed room like this... a fire is extinguished suddenly. But what about the missing diary? It's probably elsewhere. We'll soon find it. You don't believe that at all. I'd rather not believe. A bit of Cognac will do you good. You know, Deborah... I've been thinking we should move from this house. No, Eduardo, you must understand. - I'm not afraid. - You act like you are. Perhaps I am. About the diary... have you read any of its contents? No, I didn't have time. The moment I was about to read, you came in. Well, let's forget about this. I told you not to play that song. Somebody's playing the piano. This is not possible, Deborah. We're letting ourselves get carried away by our emotions. There's someone in this house. Yes, someone's trying to fool us. I'll find out who's doing this. There's no-one here. We will soon discover who it is. Don't be afraid. We're behaving like frightened children. Yes, we might be... but why are these things happening today? The fire goes out... the diary disappears... the piano looks like it's played by invisible hands... You heard it, Eduardo, you saw it. the dead don't return. Why do you speak of the dead? Because that's what we're both thinking. That she may rise from the dead and come play the piano. Why do you think of her when speaking of the dead? - You're thinking of her. It's a mere association of ideas... it's because she's dead-- What if it is Elena, here, among us? Remember the piano. I am a man of science, a Medical Doctor. I cannot believe in ghosts. Who's there? It's me, sir. I thought you might need anything. See how everything that scared us... has a reasonable explanation? Eduardo, what did you expect to find in Elena's room? I don't know. I admit it was foolish to look there. There ought to be no one there. Did you hear it? It's all natural, Deborah... it's the sound of normal things, the wind, rain, thunder. What about the groan that seemed to come from her room? Please, Debora. Restrain yourself. There's no point in saying all this... you can't fool me. You're afraid, too. Me? Afraid? Afraid of what? Of that. Did you hear that? It must be her, Eduardo. It must be her. Yes, it is! - Shut up, Deborah. Shut up. It is her. And she's after me. - Let's get out of here. She returned because she wants something from us. Something from me. I won't give anyone my love for you. It's mine. Where are you? Talk to me. Where are you? What do want with me, Elena? you may rest in peace... you are avenged. Have something to eat, Madam. You must stop rejecting your meals. Take it away. I don't want anything. Excuse me, sir. Nobody can take care of my wife as good as you. Don't turn on the light. I understand your reasons. it's a normal reaction... - but-- - Don't. I beg you. You must get over this. It's not time to give up. It is for me. do you want to recover your original face? Don't be cruel. What kind of a question is that? I feel I'm able to give your face... the beauty it once had. Why do you lie to me? Listen... after working night and day... I finally obtained a formula... that will let us achieve this wonderful goal. I can give you back your flesh, skin... which was the most beautiful in the world. Enough. Don't increase my pain. No one can do what you say. Not even you. Stop tormenting me. You know this evil came from her... she wants to punish me from her grave. I must reason as a man of science. I'd never forgive myself if I did nothing to repair this terrible damage. Say no more. It's impossible. at least let me prove I love you. I love you more than ever. Can you love this? Trust me. Soon, very soon... you will be beautiful once again. "Two corpses mysteriously disappear from the morgue". "This case has truly unusual aspects". "The corpses belong to two young women". As you can see, Gamboa, this makes no sense. Who could possibly care for corpses? Well, Inspector, whoever can sell them. Sell corpses? You can be sure that if you ever tried to sell me a corpse... I wouldn't buy it. I'm sure you wouldn't. But a doctor would, in order to practice anatomy. Well then, Gamboa... Investigate this if you want, and let me know the results. All right, Inspector. Excuse me. Who'd ever think the remains would end up here? Ever since the accident, I despise fire, Gustavo. But in this case, I have no choice. This other body will have the same end. It will last me three more days at the most. It would be a crime to put off the treatment now... when I'm just about to discern the possibility of amazing success. Professor, you wouldn't want to suspend it after all this work... just because you ran out of your supply of skin grafts. Why can't you be honest with me? I will, Gustavo. I trust no one. But I know you can help me solve this problem. What we have once begun... you will repeat until we are crowned by success. - Do you agree? - Of course. As long as it's worthwhile taking the risk... I'll give you twice the amount I gave you before. - Agreed? I've always appreciated your gratitude. Who is it? It's me, Eduardo. I'm preparing some saline solution. I'll open the door in a minute. Get out. She must not see you. Deborah, I forbade you to come to my laboratory. I know, but I haven't seen you all day. Will the next operation be soon? Tomorrow. It will be a turning point. I live on that hope. I have to go. I'll be with you shortly. I've been thinking about our conversation. I thought of an ideal place for our plans. What place? First, the robbery of corpses from the morgue... now, another stolen corpse. It's more than mere coincidence, Gamboa. That's what I think, Inspector. Let's not forget that in both cases... the stolen corpses belonged to young women. We must find the motive. This kind of robbery... is not usual among most robbers. And less so the steeling of corpses of young women. We are facing a very unusual case. I'm sure that behind all this... we'll find an abnormal person... some kind of maniac. Is this an untimely moment? No. My wife's still anaesthetised. You may speak. The operation is over for tonight. Have you been successful? Yes. There have been no difficulties. I have good news. What is it? It's about a girl that died. A pianist. Very beautiful. Very young. She had a heart condition and had a final attack today. That's what the medical certificate says. Where is this girl? In the apartment next to mine. She was my friend. The wake is today. - How are we going to do it? - Not there... Afterwards. Once she's buried in the cemetery. Cover those remains and put them away. I'll take Deborah to her room. Beautiful hands. The hands of an artist. They remind me of other hands I knew so well. I see, those of your wife before the accident. No, they remind me of the hands of my first wife, Elena. They were as beautiful as these are. I need these hands, Gustavo. I need them. All you have to do is make up your mind. I've made my decision. Tomorrow... tomorrow at 6pm is the burial. Great Spirit of Darkness... leave your abode... and bequeath me your advice... on how to destroy this man's evil wiles. A man who became insane... trying to give new life to the face and hands... of that evil woman. You have heard my voice and my grievances. I await your advice. What belongs to death, only returns to death... on the night of a Wednesday moon... the Black Night of Mercury. Tell me if my time of revenge will be then. Thank you, Noble Spirit of Eternal Darkness. L know you are infallible. I hope the guards watching out. After all the money he got, he should keep watch for a week. So this girl died of a heart attack? According to the medical certificate, she died of a coronary thrombosis. We must hurry. We're almost done. What was that? Did you hear anything? Yes, a noise. We must hurry. The knocking comes from down there. Someone's knocking down there! Don't shout. I keep hearing that knocking. It's getting louder. Can you hear it? Yes, I can. Do you think it's coming from the coffin? Of course, where else could it come from? - Holy Lord. - Restrain yourself. - We must keep on digging. - But-- I can't take it. Gustavo, stop. Give me the crowbar. She's alive. This woman has been buried alive. A case of catalepsy was taken for a heart attack... and she's alive. I have a live woman's body. A body no-one will ever claim. For the rest of the world, she no longer exists. Her hands... the hands I need. They're mine. For Deborah. Let's get her out right now, before it's too late. Hurry. This injection will keep her in a state of catalepsy. that means you'll amputate her while she's alive. - Exactly. - That would be atrocious. It would be atrocious if she could feel the pain. She'll be sound asleep. She won't know or feel that she's losing her hands. I never dreamed of such a privilege. A live transplant. The same... identical hands Elena had. I'd never find more beautiful hands for Deborah. not in my presence. Go away. Tomorrow will be the most wonderful day of my life... and you'll be able to share with me the joy of a miracle. From the wastes of death... I'm contriving life. And beauty. If you want to save your soul... you must turn yourself in to the police... and report the crimes of Doctor Eduardo Ramos. Aren't you the Doctor's housekeeper? Why are you doing this? I already told you, to save your soul. Fool... you think you're achieving your goal... but you don't know you're digging your own grave. Your time has come. I invoke you. I thought I'd find you asleep. It's useless. I can't sleep, Eduardo. This will all be over soon, Deborah. But when? Today. Tonight. You will reach the end of your suffering. I'll operate your hands and finish your face. Really? Or are you just building up my hopes? No. Today's procedure will be a long one. Very long. I trust you, Eduardo. But if something unexpected-- if she appears again... Look, Eduardo. Look. There. It's her. It's Elena. Deborah, there's nothing there. Nobody's there. But I saw her in the garden. Look again and you'll realise you were wrong. How strange. Nobody's there now. But I'm sure I saw her. I'd swear I did. No. It was your imagination. But that's over now. Come, let's go. I was expecting you. These are the hands... your husband wants for Deborah. But she'll never use them. I have other hands in store for her, Elena. Leave your hands where the others were. Your very own hands will avenge you. You may now rest in peace. Return to your abode. Can I see them now'? My hands... it's true. You didn't lie to me. I have my hands again. Try to move your fingers. The other hand. I won't ever thank you enough for what you've done for me. Don't worry now... I'll make the scar on the joint disappear little by little. I can caress you once again. Let go! I wanted to caress you... but these hands suddenly acted on their own. I couldn't control them, I had no power over them. L suppose it's normal. It'll take some time getting used to them. What a strange feeling... they seem to have a will of their own. I'm not ordering them to move. I don't want them to move. They move on their own. Don't worry. You will soon control every movement. Try now. Keep them still. See? now I want to touch my bandage. Now I'll lower my hands. when will you take off this horrible bandage? Tomorrow. In its place, you'll see the most beautiful face on earth. You need to rest now, darling. Stop that music! I can't. It's not me. These hands. I can't stop them. I'm sorry, Deborah. I can't stand that music. It's maddening. Please forgive me. I didn't want to do it. Swear you won't do it again. How could I say that now? You must turn yourself in to the police... and report the crimes of Doctor Eduardo Ramos. To save your soul. You must turn yourself in to the police... and report the crimes of Doctor Eduardo Ramos. To save your soul. It's Wednesday. The Black Night of Mercury. Do you hear me? Wednesday night. Night of Mercury. You must hear me. It's your night. It's our night. The full moon has appeared. The Forces of Evil are with us tonight. Yes, to destroy our enemies. The satanic rays of this moon... will return to death what belongs to death. Forces of Evil... Creatures of Darkness... show me your power. May all the doors of disgrace be opened! And that's all, gentlemen. Everything. This is the most atrocious statement ever heard in this place. I told you that in the end... we would have a criminal maniac. Let's go get him. We must stop this dreadful massacre. - You're coming with us. Everybody must be armed and expecting the worst. Where's Madam, Sara? She's in the lab. What are you doing here? Why are you here? What am I doing? I know what you've done. - Look. - Deborah, I - What have you given me? The hands of your victim. I have the skin of a dead woman in my face. Murderer. - Deborah. - Leave me, don't touch me. - Listen to me. Listen. - Get away from me! You criminal. Yes, I know, I know. But I did it all for you. What have you done? You made a face and hands for me... from the remains of dead women? My face is probably as disgusting as their's. You'll see for yourself. I'm taking off the bandages. You will be convinced of the beauty of your face. - I don't believe you. - Yes, you will. May my magic mirror be remade. Grant me that request, Forces of Night. A miracle come true, Deborah. Come here. Come, look in the mirror. Look. Nothing matters anymore. You have nothing to blame me. Get ready. - Where's the Doctor? - In the laboratory. This way. It's locked. See'? I couldn't let anything stop me. You were my first concern. This is the proof of my love. No one can love you more than I do, Deborah. This is unbelievable. We must find that monster. This way. I didn't want to do it, I swear. I wasn't me... it was them. These hands. These terrible hands! What belongs to death... shall return to death. This is incredible. Human eyes have never seen the likes of this. Since the dawn of civilization until today... witchcraft and magic have existed, as well as its practitioners... magicians, sorcerers and witches.
