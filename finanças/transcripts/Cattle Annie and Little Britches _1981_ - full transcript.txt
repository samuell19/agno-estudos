Cattle Annie was an outlaw with the dime novel dream little britches was the other half of this godforsaken team seeking romance and excitement they stowed aboard a train that was destined to be robbed by the doolin-Dalton gang little girls want outlaws the good boys they can't stand they want fun and adventure of life with an outlaw man little girls they want outlaws not buttons or bows they want shoot-outs and the holdups that an outlaw man controls now ned buntline wrote the stories of the outlaws way out west full of glamour and adventure of men he thought he knew best the daltons and theames gang with old bill doolin too they rode across the pages shooting their way through What's that? You only got three cars? You only got three cars? Don't shoot! It's a small train. Mainly full of... Pigs! That was your idea, creek. Brilliant. You're little dick raidler, right? Aw, hush up, grandpa, this is a hold-up. There's nothing but coffins in there. Dynamite dick! No, it ain't dynamite dick. It's goddamn bittercreek newcomb. Now, let's get on with this thing, for Christ's sake! Only three cars in the whole train. How many passengers are there? Not many, you can see them peeping out the back there. - Get 'em out. - Yes, sir. Reveille, reveille, reveille. Fall out down here! Bill doolin! Hold on there a minute, commander! I don't see any need for this, now that everybody's been introduced. Mr. Newcomb, just slow down a minute, we don't want anybody hurt. Let's see if we can't salvage what appears to be slim pickings. Folks, bill doolin! Bill doolin! That's right, and you're, uh... Oh, um... Harley Hopkins. Great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Hopkins. And I can see by the way you brought all these good folks front and center that you're a born leader. Are you an honest man? - Oh, I am that if anything. - Then tell me, is there anything on this train that might be of interest to me and my men and others of our ilk? I swear, not a cent, bill. What is this, a social? I don't think you are an honest man. Who's in charge here? Red, George, search those people. Hold it! We'll not be picking pockets now, will we? No, not yet. Red, George, check the last car. Dynamite dick's checking it! It's done, give me a hand, red. What did you find? - Damndest gear I ever saw. - It looks heavy. I'll take 'em anyway. We never leave empty-handed. Here's supper! Thank you, Mr. Hopkins. Sorry for your trouble and your time. But then life's nothing but trouble and time, eh? Let's get moving! That was a pretty shabbyob. You proud of yourself, newcomb? Oh, shut up. Let's get on out of here. You allust go riding off like that, but what about that fire? That fire on the tracks, how are we supposed to put it out? Piss on it. Well, let's round up those pigs. Hey, get this door shut. Stowaways! Mr. Hopkins! Hey, you're not supposed to be in here, now get off! Hey! Hey, come on, now! Mr. Hopkins, there's a crazy lady in there. - Enny! - Hey, stop! You lay a hand on US and I'll scream. We're bound for California. Oh, you're bound for California, huh? Well, this train goes another 50 mile, that'll leave you 1,000 to go. You can sprint the last leg. We're working our way west! All right, back with the humans, you little mites. Scoot. Up from the engines with me. You did it again! You never give me a chance to put the cold water in. Hello, what's this? A spa? You two are taking to the waters, are you? May I humbly request that you get back to work? - But... - There'll be no "but's" here. But Mr. Morgan, she burned her hands! Ah, now it's insolence, is it? I mean, I've a full house out there and now my scullery trash wish to become insolent, while me chinaust mounts up like the tower of babel. You clumsy little wench, come here. Tidy that. Be some wages lost there for sure, if I don't miss my guess. Why you contemptible little wench! I'll have my pay! - You what? - And don'tust stand there looking like a moon-struck baboon either! I'll have it now! You owe me a week, a quarter a day, fair and square! Now, you listen to me. I'll teach you some manners. Ow! Ow! What are you doing? You're fired! The both of you, you're fired! No, I ain't, you scum-sucking son-of-a-bitch! I have resigned! Out! Out! You ungrateful little wench! Out that door! I believe, sir, I shall depart through the front portal! - Come, enny. - Oh, no. You brats will not exit through the front of my establishment! - There are people out there! - I andenny are people! I'll give you “people.” Annie! You halt, sir. If you wish to keep your nose! We shall go now, enny, have your head high! Come on, enny! Come on! Hey, Annie, maybe we shouldn't have done that! It's done. Annie, Morgan'll have the law on US busting up his kitchen like that. Good, I'm sick of this damn town anyway. It's time we got on west like we planned. How? What can we do? I'll think of something. - You always do. - Let's smoke. Oh, come on. Ain't you got any money, cowboy? Well, well, well! What's you two big city belles doing out this way? Heard you were standing stud, elrod. And we'reust plum out of breath getting here. - What's she doing? - Oh, no! Look at that! I'd have lit this on your beard, elrod, if you had one. Smoking in public! Look at her. What's you two big-shots in the restaurant business doing today? - Thought you were supposed to be working. - I resigned! I've come to the conclusion my future lies elsewhere! Mine too! I'll bet you all were fired. Of course, I... l could use my influence down at the mighty rz. Oh, elrod, if you weren't so dumb and ugly, I wouldn't feel so sorry for you. I don't think I would talk. I wouldn't even ask you to dance. Oh, elrod! You're such a man! - You're loco as shit! - Marry me! Marry me! I'll have all 12 of your children, and you can beat me when you get drunk on your cowpuncher's pay! You're crazy! All right. Good afternoon, my lovelies! Love you, darling! Oh, shut up, let's try to look dignified. What the hell is this? It'sust the whole goddamn doolin-Dalton gang. Good day! Nice Autumn afternoon. Don't let US stop you hard-working people from your frolic. Thought I knew some folks in these parts, times do change. Bill! Bill! - Corey! - Bill doolin! We'll be needing some things, Corey. And set up all these good men with some of your finest corn. Not that swill you sell the poor, but honest. Come on, lads! Cold beer, let's go! First one's on me, I'm buying. That's news. You ain't never bought a drink in your life. - Yes? - Uh, this here is my boy, ned. Ned, this is Mr. Bill doolin. Iust wanted him to meet you, sir. Ned, well, you're looking fit. How'd you like to meet my partner, Mr. Dalton, if you've got the time? Gentlemen! Compliments of bill doolin! Bill, thank you! Where's all the pretty girls? Come on, darling! Come over here! Give US a dance! Goodness me! Come on... please, I don't want to dance. I'm not going to hurt you... I would love a... Mister, would you please leave me alone? Hey, doolin! What's wrong with these people? We used to have friends around here, Corey. We've had warmer welcomes. Well, so it goes. More and more people are coming in here every day. And the more people there are, the less they be friends it seems. Sounds ass-backwards, but what don't these days? Civilization's coming here, bill, be careful it don't get you. Civilization, huh? Well, let me tell you. Civilization is gonna have to getin line behind all those coming to get me. I got heck Thomas, Chris madsen, and old bill tilghman on my big old butt! Geez! Well, i'llust open up for you, bill. Let me get you something decent to drink. Corey, you, uh... You got some dead-weight around here that can keep two eyes open after sundown? Shit! Getting cautious in your old age. Not much law here yet. I haven't lived this long listening to store keeps. Hmm. What about these young fools lollygagging this way? Hey, you dolts, here now! Mr. Doolin wants to talk you, hop to it! You men know your butts from a water hole? I think so, sir. You think so? - Yes, sir. - Well, for what I want, I guess you don't have to be too sure. But if you mess up, you'll find your butts full of double-ought. Now, let me tell you what I want. You, cover the road into town. You two boys, cover the road out of town. You see any strangers, you high-tail it back and let me know. Corey's opening up. Now maybe we can get a man's drink. From Corey? Jesus, that'll be a change! I'll be seeing you. Gonna stand watch. Here you are, bill. You, you know, I always save these just for you. Jesus, Corey. What the hell do you call that, huh? That's Irish whiskey. Does it taste like Irish whiskey to you? Made it in my own back room. Hell, no! Corey, here's the list of the things we'll need. Let me go! Whoo, look it here! Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fire up the skillet, Corey! Don't you lay a hand on me again, buddy! And what if I try to steal a kiss from you, little girl? I ain't a little girl! Take one step toward me again and I'll kick you in your eggs. My what? Your eggs! I don't like my eggs scrambled. No, ma'am! Over easy, but not scrambled. Uh-uh! Annie! Annie! Well, little britches. You must be the brains of this gang, seeing she's got all the brawn. - Doolin. - Mr. Doolin to you. You're really Mr. Doolin. Unfortunately, the one and only. Corey. Give these two ladies a root beer and a sweet or two. Here you are, little girl. Oh, boy, that's what I'd like. I'm gonna get me one of those. What about you, red? Don't want it? - We'll have a whiskey. - Oh! - Oh, you will, will you? - Is she crazy? Will it be neat or branch? I'll have whatever the boys are having. We ain't boys, little girl. All right, ladies, belly up to the bar. You go a round with doolin, we'll take you at your word. - What's your name? - Annie. Annie. Little britches. A toast! May you ride long and hard. Aye! Aye! Little britches? Mmm. Oh, darling, it's evil stuff. Evil stuff. Relax a bit. There are two ways into town and both of them are covered. Iust don't know, bill. I don't know. Yeah, ease up, Dalton, you're making me nervous. Two dead brothers and one in the pen and you say, "ease up"? Just part of outlawing. Hey, Corey! Make sure you put a bag of jawbreakers in that, okay? I'll give you aawbreaker! Yeah? Crazy Pennsylvania cowpuncher. Don't get kin to that, boy. Hey, any of you gentlemen have a smoke? Smoking and drinking, what's next? First youust offer a piece to the wind. I've read all about you, fellas. Through Mr. Ned buntline's literary works. I've followed all your deeds of derring-do and bravery. This ned buntline. Now what the hell does he know about US? Everything, bill, everything! Mr. Doolin! Riders, Mr. Doolin! - How many? - -Two I've seen, there's more! Let's move. Let's get the hell out of here. Annie, I feel sick. Come on, boys, let's not waste any time. Geez, me flask. Hey, you'd make a good outlaw. All right. Ride! We shall follow! We shall! Good evening, gentlemen. Who is it? Hey! You brought some new blood with you. I'm, uh, US marshal, bill tilghman. I wonder if any of you kind folks have, uh, seen, what I say, about, a half a dozen gentlemen ride this way recently? Now, I'm not looking for an informer. Just a nod here and there will do. Right, let me tell you then why I'm here. I'm looking for Mr. Bill doolin, to be exact. Well, come on, folks, he's no hero! He robs banks! In those banks is your money! And who do you work for? United States government. If you see, uh, Mr. Doolin before I do, you can tell him that, uh, I'm gonna get him. I'm coming to get him and get him I shall. As those amongst you who know me can believe... You're getting a little old, aren't you, bill tilghman, to be running down the best? He may be the best, all the rest are dead. But you can tell old doolin that old tilghman is coming after him and I'm gonna Bury his calloused ass into the dirt! Is that clear? Our horses are dead tired, so why don't youust take 'em to the corral? Yes, Mr. Tilghman. Now, is there a gentleman named Corey here about? Here, sir. Anything I can do for you gents? Maybe. Working my way, way out west sail away, lady sail away sold my stuff and all the rest sail away, lady sail away don't you rock him, daddy-o all of our clothes into our trunk sail away, lady, sail away find me a bar and drink me drunk sail away, lady sail away don't you rock 'em, daddy-oh-de I when I find me an outlaw man sail away, lady sail away sail away out to another land sail away, lady sail away don't you rock 'em, daddy-oh-de! Don't you rock 'em, daddy-oh-de! > What are those? Damn buzzards! We've got a pistol right here. Who did you borrow the pistol from? A legacy from my dear, dead daddy. A hero of the confederate army! A giant falsehood. Your daddy died from the consumption, as sure as mine died from drink. So be it. But a person can go a long way out here with a pistol! All this is wrong, Annie. It's too soon to tell what is right or wrong. Are you with me or not? I'll not be a white nigger slave woman my whole life long! I'd rather burn like a fire. Are you with me? I'm with you, Annie. But I'm hot and tired and we're out of water. That will pass. We'll ride hard now. And live high later. Bittercreek newcomb would not lie to me. Doolin will take US in. - Enny? - Hmm? - Do you ever do it? - Do what? - You know what. - Yeah, I know what. And you know I haven't, so why do you ask? Sometimes people lie about stuff like that. Well, neither have I. But I'm gonna do it with bittercreek newcomb. - Oh, Annie! - It's in my mind. Like a hot coal! Really? Oh! Come on. Come on. - Come on. - Annie. - What? - You must not leave me. I ain't gonna leave you. Is that... is that... Hey! Is... bittercreek! Bittercreek! You see, enny? I told you! - Stand clear. - No! Offer some to the earth, before you drink. She'll always provide. Dynamite! You ought to see this. Your half-breed pal's back. He brought you something. God damn it. Now, that is an odd spectacle. What do you boys make of that? What you got there, bittercreek? I believe we've all met before. Ain't they them testy Guthrie strumpets? Put 'em in the shade, get 'em some water. What's this all about, breed? Theyust want to consort with some low-life. Well, they sure chose well. Now, suppose youust take 'em back where you got 'em. You hear me, breed? You got pig-shit for brains! Two goddamn children. Now, what the hell is this? I don't know what this is. Used to be a gang and a good one. Now it'sust a bunch of bums on the run. You'd never say that to my brother, Bob, and live to tell it. Are you trying to imply, Mr. Newcomb, that you got better ideas? Robbing this train was your thought, I let you have your way. Maybe we can steal more toys from tiny trains. Is that your idea of brilliance? And under your brilliance, we've come to all this! Iust got here. I... iust got here. And I tend to agree with Mr. Newcomb. These fellas and these surroundings are sore on the eyes and do not doustice to your reputation. You, Mr. Dynamite dick, as I recall, you should either grow the beard or shave! What you got now is near disgusting in appearance. You girls look sorely beat. Red, make a place for them to rest. Use my bunk. Morning, girls! How about a cup of coffee? You ought to be drinking milk. Coffee will be fine. You ladies like something a little bit more solid in your guts? Annie! Catch! Jenny, it's a baseball! Where did you get all this stuff? You mean you never heard of the great baseball train robbery? Hey, can you fellas play this game? There's not enough of US. Rule book here says you got to have nine. The way I remember seeing the game played back east, they used two teams. That's right. Look, I'll divide the team, and then I'll explain the particulars. What the hell is that? It's the goddamn first base. Bill! You're out, you broke the whiskey bottle! Maybe [I'll go in myself, upstream, of course, from these louts. Hey! Are you girls coming in? In front of all these people? Gentlemen, I believe the ladies would like to bathe. I don't trust 'em. Make 'em close their eyes. Hell, I can't get most of 'em to keep 'em open. However, Mr. Dalton and I will become trees. You girls may disrobe behind US. Get back, raidler. There's no looking at the ladies. Mr. Weightman! Mr. Buck, get back! Get your ass back in there. Let me know when you're ready, girls. "In front of everyone?" - Everyone but bittercreek. - Yeah, that's right. Gentlemen, I say we'll ride. And damn their eyes! We'll ride with pride. Empire city! I sure as hell always wanted to hit that bank! It's two days' ride to empire city. We'll stop off at Ingalls tonight, where it should be safe to leave the ladies. Where's our littleenny? Gone to bed the minute we got to the boarding house. This one's ready to go with her, seems to me. Hey there, Mr. Doolin. Come meet the girls. Evening, ladies. Okay. - Bittercreek! - Get down! Doolin! Red, get around the back! Dalton! Damn, I hate getting up early in the morning. Jesus Christ, raidler! This is no time to be sitting on your ass! - You all right, kid? - Yeah. Stay down low. Annie! - The girl's trying to kill me! - Annie! The gang's getting surrounded. There's doolin! Go ahead. God damn, what I'd give for a stick of dynamite. Come on! Yeah! Get out there! Get out there! Get out! Go! That's it, come on, let's get out. Move! Move! Move! George! George! Come on! Come on! Come on, let's go! Bill tilghman. How the hell did he know about this place? What's goin' on here? - Anybody hurt? - Uh-uh, nah. Somebody fix up Annie. Bill? I'm afraid we got you girls into some trouble. But we'll get you out. She got US out of this one. That was a smart move with them cattle, Annie. How much longer you figure we got? We're five minutes late already. Let's get moving! Back to rock fort. Annie, you forgot your bag! Somebody put down that poor horse. That your horse, Annie? Sort of. Then you ride on out. I'll do what's gotta be done. No! I'll do what must be done! Move out! It seems to me all the right words are getting into all the wrong ears. Hey, Dalton, that was great support you gave bill back there. Where'd you learn that, from your brothers in poppyville? Watch your mouth! I think you're losing it, doolin. Christ, they know every move we make! Yeah, they sure as hell do! And that is exactly how my brothers got it! A goddamn leak that got back... Ah, for Christ's sake, Dalton, you and your bloody... All right, that's enough! Well... I say we lay up. Well, it says here... "But doolin has an ironclad discipline "and an almost oriental-like concentration." What the hell is this? Let me see that! The fantastic adventures of the doolin-Dalton gang. By ned buntline! Here! Is my name in there? Let me see! Now, wait a minute! Big bill tilghman... Bigger and possibly smarter than... The aging bill doolin! Shit! Don't tear the bloody thing! Aging bill doolin, my ass! I'll show ned buntline how my story ends! The doolin-Dalton gang, rides again! What are you trying to prove? My daddy once told me about Saturday night. He said, "go big or stay home!" There'll be no pig shit on this one. How can you be so sure about that? Well, I'll tell you, bittercreek. I got an almost... Oriental-like concentration! Well, what's the plan? Ah, the plan. This time it's gonna be different. This time... You'll all be dressed to the nines, just as pretty as you please. In suits and ties... And we'll go strolling through the town... Like upright, honest citizens... Out on a holiday. - Little dicky raidler. - Yes, sir! I want you to go to Corey's for some more supplies, and whilst there... I want you to purchase two nice, snappy bonnets... For the little girls. You, red... You'll put your big mouth to use now! You'll go into the town, you'll spread the word... That come Thursday, Thursday next, we're gonna take the train with the big mine payroll. Only we won't be there. But, tilghman... Tilghman will! That'd make all the papers back home. All the big papers back east! That's the spirit! And, bittercreek... You, along with weightman, go to the old man and bring back some fresh horses. We'll want the finest. And the ladies... Ah, yes, the ladies... You'll be down at the creek, washing and pounding our clothes... So it'll be nice and clean for the occasion. You're all gonna lookust dandy! Why'd you choose that stinkin' breed to scout ahead? Breed's half animal. Can smell danger. Hey, Annie, did you hear what they said about your precious bittercreek, huh? Ma'am. Good morning. I wish to withdraw some money from your bank. All of it. Everybody on the floor! No, no, no, dicky, no! Stop! You there! Out here. Move! Hey, you! Shaky! Start putting something green in the bag. - There's no... - Find some! He's tryin' to tell you we don't have any sacks. Every bank has a sack! I swear, we're fresh out. Well... Did any of you guys bring a sack? Nobody brought a sack. All right... Off with your pants. - What? - Off with your pants! - What? - Dead or alive! Get them goddamn clothes off right now! All right, son... Put the money on the counter. Both drawers... And don't move! Nice work there, unior! Now, let me have that watch! Oh, come on! Ooh, look at that. Got oneust like Dalton! Hogtie that boy! Here come the girls. I knew it! I knew that son of a bitch didn't like trains! Good mornin', ladies. Ooh, that went slicker than a greased pig! Good mornin', gentlemen! Better stop there! 'Cause that's as far as you're gonna go! Who speaks? US marshal, bill tilghman. I've heard of you. And I've heard you, too, sir. What now, sir? Well, if you're gonna walk out of this town... You're gonna have to get by me first! Everybody stay put! Stay low. Sit! Goddamn shooting gallery! Easy, George, easy. Now, I'll tell you what I want you to do! I want you to walk towards the middle of the street... Keep your hands up and keep 'em up high! Get 'em! Get down! Stay down! You all right, dicky? Yeah. Itust grazed my boot. That dumb asshole George... He's dead. Wait a minute! I've got enough dynamite to blow this whole goddamn town apart! Yes, and US too! Doolin! You've got one minute to come out with your hands up or I'm gonna blow the back of the bank off! So far you done them two girls and George a great service. You got any moves left, old man? Cut him loose. - He's a deputy! - Don't! We need him! Cut the rope! What's your name? Capps! Roger capps! You a family man? - Yeah. - Then you ought to be selling shoes, instead of playing parts you ain't suited for. Red! Tilghman! We've got your Roger capps! And I would not like to be him! Bill? The people wanna see you hang! And I shall see that they're due! Now, give up, bill! All things come to an end! You two stay put! Down! Breed, get him up! Get up, god damn it! The rest of you men gather around here, real close! He's our ticket to safety. Tilghman, we're coming out. Hold your fire! Give US a fair start or you'll lose your man. Can't do that, bill. This ain't a game no more! Blow it out your big fat ass, bill tilghman! What the hell's wrong with you, bill doolin? Shielding yourself with two little girls! Holding a man's life to protect your own? Do as they say, bill. They know I'm the law! Bill, please! So be it. All right, put your guns down and keep 'em down! Dynamite, raidler, pick up George. Move! Annie, enny, mount up! Get on the damn horse! Move capps out! A man can see for miles out there, tilghman... I see one cloud of dust... Your capps will die. You ain't gonna kill that man, bill doolin! Red buck and dynamite will. One wrong move, I'm gonna send him home in an envelope. It's on your head, bill. Mornin! What is this that I can see? But icy fingers taking hold of me my name is death, none can excel I hold the keys to heaven or hell oh, death can you spare me over for another year? Oh, death, consider my age please don't take me at this stage & my wealth is all at your command if you will move your icy hand & bittercreek? There's nothin' movin'. We can let our Mr. Capps go now. He can have a nice walk. Come on, get! Folks are sick and tired of your kind, bill doolin. You know that young fella, at the bank? The teller? He's only been on theob three months. You know, the only valuable he had was his watch. And your man raidler took it off him. Why don't you leave US alone? Mr. Capps, wait a minute! Got the man's watch, dicky? Just want to be punctual. Give it to Mr. Capps. Give it to him! - Dynamite? - Yes, sir? Give him $50. And buy Mr. Tilghman and his boys a drink. Or anyone else we've inconvenienced. Why don't you give him something for widows and orphans too while you're at it? Breed, the money is nothing! Now, I'm tired and I'm weary and we've lost a good friend. So shut up! Mr. Doolin? Yes? Don't go back to rock fort. They know about it now. Why are you telling me this? I don't know. I'm death, I come to claim your soul leave the body and leave it cold drop the flesh off of your frame the earth and worms both have a claim what is this that I can see? These icy fingers taking hold of me my name is death, none can excel I hold the keys to heaven or hell & we have some friendsust up ahead. We're all strung out about as far as we can go. The old man's hovel is nearby. Goddamn weather can't last forever! Only three months. It's called the rainy season, bill. Your two gals will probably catch their death of cold. You girls all right? I feel so bad that George is dead, bill. George was a good man! Those aren't good men up there. Well, they're good men, but... But they aren't good men, if you know what I... In the end, we ain't doin' right... A good man does right. You and Annie should go your own way. Quick as we can fix it, little britches. My name isenny! Jenny, I'm gonna give you and Annie some money right now! And when we get through this night... You'll be off for something more fitting. It's gone. All of it. It's gone! Bill? Bill. Thanks. Well, enny... Got any advice for this old man? Mmm-mmm. I never thought I'd live to see the day I couldn't get some free advice. This world of pissants and grovelers is about the only thing that people give each other with no strings attached. Here! So I started taking. Mmm. In the long run, it evens out. You wind up with a... A mouthful of salt and a handful of memories. Better see what's going on down there. What are you thinking, enny? That I love you. But, uh, that I don't... Love you. There's a "but" to everything. They're talking about splitting up down there. But you can still be brave... And [I'll follow you to the end, bill. Little britches! Well, Mr. Dalton... What do you think? Uh, I'm going back to politics in California, bill. I don't know why the hell I ever left in the first place. I think I'll go on a vacation myself. Tell me, breed... Them hot Springs. Old Indian folks say they're rejuvenating. Any truth to that? So the legend goes... You know that... That all legends end in bullshit, don't they, doolin? Well, i'llust try and see if this one works. You coming back? Yes, I'm coming back. And when I do, we'll all be of one mind now, won't we? I don't know. I'm with you, bill doolin. Mr. Doolin, to you, kid. Weust gonna let him leave? Let him go. I think he's through. Yeah, we all through. Whoa! Whoa! Ho, there! A very good day to you, Mr. Doolin. It gladdens a man's soul to see a free man out for a morning ride. And where are you headed all alone now? Corey, I haven't lived this long idly giving my destination to store keeps. Yeah, but is it livin', Mr. Doolin? I hear you're a runnin' man more than anything these days. You tryin' to tell me somethin, Corey? Me? Why, no, Mr. Doolin! What could I tell you? I'm only a store keep. True. Well, then, top of the morning to you. Hal Bittercreek, are you really an Indian? When my family was killed, and I was raised with the sioux... They had the great spirit, but they, too, were dying. But you have a... You have a great spirit in your life, for... for your world. You're as brave and as strong as any of US. Go to that world of yours, Annie. Afternoon, gents! How's business?
