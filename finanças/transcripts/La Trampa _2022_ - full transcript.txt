"All In". - So, you mean this is just mad? - We'll have to leave this country, then. These Property Titles were stolen from me! I reported it to the authorities. - The police themselves don't work! - That file says that... - that title is from that company. - That thing is fake. You are telling me that this is useless? That I invented this copy of the original? No, that can't be. Relax, Marquito. Relax? - I ain't gonna give you any money. - You bet with money you didn't have. I ain't gonna pay you because you're a cheater. Me? A cheater? Watch your mouth. Bring it. If you say that that title exists, bring it here, then. They broke into my house and stole it. What's happening? Marco. Daddy - Marco! - Daddy, let me explain. - What did you do? Daddy, let me explain everything, Nothing's happening, this man is gonna- Nothing will happen until your son pays what he owes me. - Let me go! - Let him go! Those bastards went to buy my lands and I told them no. They're a bunch of thieves, but don't worry, everyone here will go to jail! And you have six days to pay. Let the boy go! I'm going to execute you! Let the boy go! You'll pay for this! Take him out! You have 6 days... Oh God, why do I listen to Zoe? I had to wake up early. Pachi! You're breathing on her, you're unhygienic. Don't people here think? For the love of God, they're... - Pachi! - What! This is looking beautiful sis, I love it! And more to come! What are these pepper bags? I told you that there must be 2 meters between each table! Do you need a measuring tape?! Or basic math?! Should I send you back to school?! This is the bag. Oh my lord. Ah! What happened? Releasing tension. Uncle, what the hell? Trees... People... Flowers... And Molotov. Serve me another. Are you sure? As sure as I am that a brunette like you shouldn't be serving drinks. Very nice of you. Drop the kindness and serve me that drink. Fede, at your service. Stop telling me that, brunette, or I'm going to make you serve something else. I'm Irma, it's a pleasure. Good morning, ma. My queen, here. Oh, thank you. Look, honey, don't you like me? Do I remind you of your mother-in-law? - And what's wrong with Patricia? - The usual. Imperfections. How can I get a chicken thigh that is across the table with that in the middle? Ma, isn't it too early for you to drink? It is a mimosa, but without juice. Besides, if you're going to sit me in an anthill naked, I think I started just in time. Don't overreact, the world isn't going to end just because you sit next to dad for a while. Neither because I'd stick my tongue in an outlet, right? Go to the ceremony! Bring me food, get me some food right now! Pachi! Don't talk to them like that, they're working. Let me find another drink. Don't you dare. It's water! - Are you going to recharge, Molotov? - Of course! Hey, you. Why "Molotov"? Full of alcohol and with a short wick, poof. This almost seems like something for the rich and people of good taste. Oh, uncle, thanks for lending me your house. This house is yours, and if your aunt hadn't taken the other one in the divorce, that would be yours too. I hope the will doesn't say that, huh? Blessing, pa. Did you solve it? I'm gonna tell you what the testament will say. Excuse me. Go ahead, cousin. The cows, should be in the will, and not you, they have done more for me than you. Yes, yes, yes. And what have the cows done? Ok, check, check, check. Perfect. Ok, ok. We are... We are in. Third pipeline to the left. My God, protect me. That's why I'm here, uncle. No sir, I trust Him more. Let's go. You never learn, girl! You never learn! You're always late! The other one will kill you... I have a damn hangover... Dear God! - Very good. - 'Cause I feel like... Oh, what are we going to do? Oh my God, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Damn, brunette. And those beautiful eyes? There are going to be two weddings today. Zoe! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I have your dress, my dress, Diego's suit, what else do you want, sis? Punctual, as usual. As usual, I'm here. Everything's gonna be perfect. Look at that beautiful day, how sunny! Go, ahead girl, it's gonna look nice. I'm here, I'm here. Change that face, come on, Who's getting married today? Who's getting married today? You're finally here! You came here to work, when you finish your work, then you can drink whatever you want, crazy hare. Yes yes yes, we know. - I got the number of the guy. - Girl! That's not how you tie that! Bring breakfast to that girl! Look at how malnourished she is. I wanna know why the young man isn't over here and why did you put the old man to this? You don't know how to hack a computer, do you? - Do you?! - Find my mouth, find my mouth. To the left. The other left! Didn't you say right? And how many lefts do you have? Uncle, to the other side. Let's toast! The time is near. Pachi, have a drink with us. Girl, drop that for a minute. I'm working! What are you doing? - Now we are finally getting married. - Oh! Baby, my love! - You're here! - What's up, babe? Oh, I missed you. What's up? - How are you? - Here... Tell me, did you behave well yesterday at the bachelor party? I went crazy. You did? Yeah, I got screwed! Then we're both screwed! At least you're aware. Damn, Diego, what do you do to have your hair like that? Ask my stylist. No way, you're the one responsible for that? You know it. - Since high school. - You're like a Rosemary dropper! You've been together for too long, I don't know how you stand each other. We tell each other everything, we have no secrets and we've always been friends. I'm glad about that. We were friends till the day of the closet. There you go again with the closet story. You sound like a broken record. - Don't be haters, that was romantic, right baby? - Romantic? The devil got into you there. Huh, did you feel harassed? Yes. People, more work, less talk. Of course, while he was hiding during the panic attack. It wasn't a panic attack; it was stage fright. Mm-hmm whatever, but the woman raped you. I didn't abuse him; I was reassuring him. Yes, we already know, you calmed him down and now we are here, in the future, with Do√±a Patricia solving your life as usual, while you're talking shit. In the meantime sweetie, go get ready. And what are you waiting to take a bath? Okay. Hey, look. Do you want me to take a bath? - Listen to me... - Seriously? Baby, don't you dare! I know you! Don't get creative. - Look, I'll take a bath... - Don't make me leave her a widow! - Cheers, my love! - Baby, don't do it! Let the Show begin! - Don't get creative, don't...! - Baby, no! - Don't do it! - Hey! Stupid! You told me to take a bath. Oh, I love my new brother-in-law! The show just begun! - The wedding started. - Get out of there, damn it! Get out! Get out! Get out! Calm down! Get out of there, get out! Get out, get out! Get out of there! You have to cut the cable, the blue one, be careful with cutting the red one. I'm going to cut your red one when I get out of here. Boy I used to strip wires with my teeth. You don't even know how to charge a phone, who was supposed to hack the computer? I'll learn. You don't have to be a genius to burn. Uncle, focus, for God's sake, focus. Ok, that blocked the system. - The what? - The... Ugh. Uncle, don't mind me, keep going. There goes the virus. Done. Perfect, perfect, perfect. Perfect, perfect, perfect. Exactly. Hello? Ah, yes, send me a technician, there's an issue with the cameras. Damn, anyone could adopt that brunette guy. I can't believe this; I'm finally marrying that man. Look sis, tie him down; I'm telling you, those are not easy to find. We know your story. He's fine, but I don't quite like him. But you better secure him because there are women everywhere and I don't wanna see you cry. Don't worry sis, that will be mine today. Cheers! Let's toast! Come here baby! You're the cutest thing we have! You're so pretty! Smile! Look at that tiny mouth! What's up. Hello Aldo. Conde? How did you get in? Seems like you have an event today. You didn't invite me to the party, bandit. No no, it isn't a party, it is my niece's wedding. Is that so? Congratulate her for me. Tony, send her a gift tomorrow. You didn't answer my question. I entered from the back, there were employees pulling out chairs and stuff like that. And they didn't pay much attention to who got in and who got out. You should seriously consider a security system, I could help you with that. Oh yeah, to get rid of the bandits... - What? - No, nothing. Do you have my money? Conde, you gave me 6 days to pay it - and they are due tomorrow! - Yes, yes; that's true. But things have changed. But how so? Hey! Wait! Wait, I suffer from blood pressure. If I faint, we both are gonna be screwed! We've had some complications during business that will make me abandon the country as soon as possible. Oh, that's good. Since I freed some funds of a former employer, there's a detective that's obsessed with me and I came to claim the outstanding debt. I get you, but tell him to release me so we can talk. Well, yes, yes. Let him go. So, you have until today, exactly until 7:38. You're too specific with that. Yes, yes. I'm kind of compulsive with those things. I like to calculate the flight time, the time to arrive to the airport, the time to arrive here, and even the contingency plan if I have to bury you... Bury who? Only if you don't pay me. - So, you're meticulous. - I'm just being careful, I'd said. Conde, that's a lot of dough, isn't it? It's too much money! Help me out, I could find half of it. I know that's a difficult task for you, but I thought about that contingency plan. Yes, and you figured out the time to bury me too. Look, I trust you, why don't you sell those old steeds of yours? You could take a loan, I mean, what are a couple of millions between friends? All my friends are poor, they're stingy. Well... I'm leaving you a reminder of what we talked about. No, no... Now, tie the rope around the iron tube, one turn in the lashing hook as I taught you. Now he's teaching me how to tie knots... When I've even tied dogs with sausages. Here we go... Come on, faster! You can't do anything right. Didn't they pay you to watch the door? Watching? I'm watching you... Look, at five, when you're finished and you leave through the 3rd door let's take a walk somewhere. - What's that hook? - What hook? Oh no love, I'm not dating you because you're too unbearable and relaxed. My love, remember that I'm watching, I'm watching you. Drop that. - What's this? - It's a gas that makes people sleep. Aren't you only supposed to know about computers? I bought it on the internet, don't ask me to whom. I'm working with a criminal. Alright uncle, we have exactly 12 min before the girl comes back and finds the car empty. Come down very carefully. You think I'm an idiot... Uncle, are you okay? Yeah, yeah... What happened?! I think I screwed up my momentum and there's a little problem with the knot. Daddy, daddy, was he here?! Ah, I see that he already talked with you. We got the money. Did we? I've gathered all our damn accounts searching for money and we didn't even have half of it! All because of your damn gambling! Miserable! Bastard... Sorry, you need to check on your finances - Shut up shithead! I'll make things right. - I love you, dad. - Yeah, you love to screw me. Alright, I'm in control. I'm too old for this. Uncle, keep calm, what are you searching there? Search in the safe box. What do you want? It's very easy for you! You're just with a computer typing stuff, why don't you come here?! Uncle, keep calm, keep searching, but keep calm. What the hell do you want?! Ok, ok, everything's alright, everything's under control, keep calm. Shut your mouth and let me focus! They're coming. We made it! I got it! Ok, now what? Fuck, crap, what do I do. Johnny think, think, think... What are you looking there? I'm looking for an exit! Call me a cab then! Uncle, uncle, uncle... Uncle, talk to me! Push a button and take me out of here! Ok, uncle don't move. You haven't emptied those bags yet? What? Ah! Grab it! Grab it! Ah! You know that these are premium horses, that's why I'll sell them to you at half price, cash. That's for today. How much?! Forget it! - Are you ok? - Yeah, who was that guy? I don't know. Those are 100 acres, but cash on hand. How much? With what you're offering you'll have to keep with the dirt on your nails. What's up, Manito? Is your ex-wife taking all your money away? She already sucked everything she could. You started early, Molotov, when you explode, you'll take half of the property. I called you to see if you had a couple of millions by chance. Wait, you're serious? Marcos got in trouble and I gotta find some money quick, in cash. That kid really screwed it, right? Look, I drink too much to have that amount of money. I think you'll need to ask Caligula for a loan. You think my ex-brother-in-law will lend me money? Oh, brother...! Well, I could threaten to make a scene. But he's the only one with that kind of money. And doesn't he know that banks exist? He's a criminal, I think he buries all the money he earns. I'll thank you if you knock that door for me. You look awful without a mustache. - I'm screwed. - Plan B, uncle, you need to get in here. What are you doing here? Weren't you on the van? Uncle, for real, we are about to get screwed up, please get in here. No sir, I'm not a tool you can put in there, you have it all wrong! Uncle Jaime, for Christ's sake, please get in here! You're always coming up with stuff, why wasn't that the plan to begin with?! I walked like a mouse going around those tubes, I go caught in a rope, I fell down and you're dressed like a pimp?! Uncle, you were supposed to go in and out without anyone noticing. But now we're out of time and we have a big trouble! Okay, okay! Ok, ok, be calm right there... - Wait, wait. The bag. - What? Uncle, quick, quick! - Done, done, let's go. - Okay. Alright, keep calm. We need to cross the casino. Are you going crazy? What if the virus you planted expired and they see us on camera? Don't worry, trust me. Maybe you think I'll dance bachata here. All quiet... Okay... I turn here... Slowly... Couldn't you find something else with air conditioning? Or more hygienic? This smells really bad. Keep calm, uncle, I know what I'm doing. I turn to the right here... Hey uncle, we're getting there. Don't throw me off. Be quiet, we are almost there. - Stop there! - Was that for us? - God, please help us... - God no... Alright guys, take him to Suarez's office. Boy, do you want to kill me? Uncle. We are rich! I still don't believe we got out of there! Uncle, I told you to trust me! But what are we gonna do with the people we left there? Well, that complicates things but don't worry, I'll take care of it. Yeah, but people don't disappear pushing a button on a computer. Well, I'll park the van so you can drive it. I'll solve the casino issue now. Hello! Darling, Diego is ready! He's bathed and groomed, just like you asked! You're so nice! You're beautiful! - Thanks! I love it...! - I think it's missing something. Stop that already, please. - I like it. - You look like a princess, sis; don't listen to her. A 6/10 and I'm being generous. And for Patricia, Mrs. Perfection, to say that... Excuse me, good evening, how's everything here? Ew, uncle, why did you shave? To look more handsome on the wedding. Now I see why you never shaved... - Where's your mom? - She's outside. To me, you look handsome with that look, Don Aldo, you look good with that baby skin. Zoe, control your whoring for today. Let the kid enjoy herself. Let me find the civil judge. What a foolish woman. Daddy, I need to talk with you. Oh my God! For real, Marco, you too? It was hot and humid, you know... You look like sand paper, boy. Why did you do that to your hair today for my wedding? You look like a brush. - Marco! - What happened? Do you have any idea of how difficult it is to organize a wedding? - No... - I know you don't, because if you had any common sense you'd know that between the groom and the bride there must not be a metal brush. You're not ruining my picture, understood? - Whatever. - You look sexy, don't mind her. Oh well... Dad, can we talk? It's urgent. What is it? Come, come. What? Tell me, what do you want? Dad, I rounded up a couple of powerful friends and I'm setting up a game, we'll solve the problem. Are you nuts? I don't want that people here! Aren't you forgetting something? Conde didn't give us a lot of time... I'll take care of that, leave that be! No, that's impossible, some guy wants to bet 7 million and I'm going to steal them! I don't care! Do you forget your betting is what got us into this fucking mess? Trust me, this is my big break. - Do you want to kill me? - It's the best opportunity... - Go away! - Daddy, trust me... - I'll take that... - Get out of here! I didn't ask to be born. God, what did I do to you? Give me a break. It's a virus, but not a very complex one, it only affects the signal between the camera and monitors. But it's all in there? Yes, but I don't have the accounting office. - Oh well. - Excuse me, do we have video? - Yes sir. Damn, he knows where all the cameras are. Pause it. Zoom in. Very well, got to start somewhere. Corporal, let everyone know we're looking for a white van with a blue sign on the right side, "JJ Repairmen." Perfect. - Generate a picture. - OK. Come with me. - Do you think he did it? - Conde? Maybe. The guy knows where the cameras are, he knows the safety protocols, and he's a gangster. I told you not to do business with him. Let me remind you that his idea of owning the land for my new casino worked like a charm. The guy did what he had to do, no one helped me, they didn't want to sell me the land and he got it for me. And now you fed him and he bit your hand. Get him, find what he took away with him. If you do, you don't owe me a thing. Nothing? Not a thing. At your service. OK, no... Yes, I'm heading there. When the guests come here I want you to give them drinks - and bring them to the pool area... - Paty, honey... I'm working, man! Give me some room. Look, don't be mad but I want you to know that daddy invited some last minute guests. - Yes, so? - They're business colleagues, they're not very educated, you know. Boy, this is your house, but if you had said so earlier I would make arrangements, with more waiters and more tables. I know but you know daddy, at his age, some things... How many are they? About 7. But they'll just hang around in a corner. Let's see what we can do, it's not easy. I know you can do it, get it done. Don't count on me! - Love you! - I hate you. Hello Tong! Good morning. Hey Chinatown... - Hi Marco. - Good morning. - Quinto! - What's up, king? Watch out, I see a lot of movement here. It's a family event. - Are you sure? - Yes. Alright. The Tong cat! What's up? Let this be the last time you call me without warning. I'll kill you next time! The guests are quite folkloric. - Welcome, let's get started with the game. - Let's go. Hey, do you guys want something to drink? Welcome, welcome, come in. Wonderful, this wedding will be great. How are you? What a blondie! Anyone can be a parent, right? - Hi sweetie! - Hi Zoe! How are you? Come in. Great, you look amazing. - Mrs. Susana! - Good afternoon! We're celebrating Laura and Diego's wedding. - Yes, everything looks great! - Of course it does. - Welcome, welcome, come on in! - Good afternoon. - How are you? Come in, thank you! - How are you? Everyone is arriving, it's all ready. - What are you doing on the computer for so long? - Don't worry. "Don't worry" you're telling me not to worry, I almost laid an egg out of fear and you're telling me not to worry. I just hope you have a good plan, because we can't go back home anymore. I'm entering the police's database. - And you can access it from there? - I knew it! The van has been reported. - What? - That's the description of this vehicle. What the hell? It's this van's description? - A white van in which we're in, right now? - Uncle, look out! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I almost had a heart attack. - Do they know it belongs to us? - Uncle, you're suffocating me. I'm suffocating you? Or are you suffocating me?! Calm down, I have a plan to fix this. Of course you do! You millennials want to fix everything with computers. Almost, almost, almost... - Done, done? - Yes. Done, you pushed a button, we're out of the system, problem solved. I did something so they can't link us to this vehicle. What did you do? I had to report it as stolen. You reported it as stolen?! Yes, but I made it look like it happened 6 hours ago so we can't be linked to it. No, no, wait, let me get this straight, you're telling me this van, which you reported as stolen, is the same one that got into some casinos to steal the documents? Exactly. So, super genius, let's see what to do with this van, things are getting hot. We definitely can't go back home. We have to get rid of this van, now. Of course, what an idea! Uncle... Things will work out. - Oh my Lord! - God Help Us! - Did he see us? - No, I don't think so. But how cute is my precious little girl. Thank you, mom. How does it look? Spectacular. It's marvelous. Take this. What's that? To help you relax, nothing wrong with it. I don't need that. Keep it. - Then give it to me. - No. Zoe, you better be ready in twenty minutes with Diego because we're leaving. Where's Diego? Okay. Girl, stop looking at yourself or you'll break! Look how beautiful. That dress fits you perfectly. It's better than the other one. Everything is going to be nice. Thank you. A man as modern as yourself, and now you use that crap. So you know, these phones never fail. All those screens are eating your brain. Okay, we're on our way to drop this van but... Are we walking or in a flying cloud? We'll figure it out. All right, all right. So, that means no one in this country solves anything? That means that we're screwed. Look, you have to understand that what I want the most is to help you. But I don't have evidence. Something, those titles you say were stolen. I cannot proceed against the casino. And we have been investigating these people for a long time. And we know that, within the police, they have someone who covers up for their crimes, bribes, scams. But we don't have enough evidence. Look, if you know anything, call me. The prosecution is crazy about getting these guys. Okay. Uncle, you and me, let's go all in. - Let's do it. - Let's go. Finally, we have something. Grab the bag, uncle. Let's leave this place. Yeah. Damn! What's all this money? What's that money? I don't know! I was in the vehicle, I got out, I took my bag. But I don't know! But uncle, how could you be mistaken? Surely people don't make mistakes. What do I know? I got in, I was in a hurry, I was crazy, and suddenly I took the bag you gave me this morning! Yes, yes, you gave in to temptation. You fell for the money. And why would I want the money? I found what I was looking for! Are you going crazy? What do I want the money for? We're screwed. Okay, okay. What do we do?! Wait, wait. Think, Johnny, think! Okay, the money stays here. Perfect. It will seem like the thieves got scared, they ran away, and this van is reported. We leave the keys on it and we have nothing to do with it. Yes, yes! They stole it. Of course, it's perfect. They stole it. - Let's go, now. - Yes, yes, yes. We need to walk faster. Yeah, but you're walking like a criminal. Uncle. No, no, we are honest people. We don't steal. Oh dear God. - I stole. - We need to keep walking. I'm a thief! Nobody taught me that. I know you didn't steal that money. No, no, I didn't steal it. Nobody taught me that. - I come from an honest family. - Hey, hey, hey. Can you hear that? Uncle, that's a sleeping pill. People fall asleep but do not die. Come here, here, here. Look, uncle. Are you thinking the same as me? If we sneak in there, and let this cool down, no one is going to know what we did. This is the perfect alibi. The what? Look, an alibi... Come here, come here. Keep going, keep going! Act as if we are from here. For example, those are the plantations. Yes, of course. It's for sale at a good price. Sure, of course. That's good. And, more or less, how much would be your budget? Oh, well that's... Good morning! Yes, brother, I got those from Caligula. So we need to see if the Conde picks what I counted. He'll only kill me. But I'm going to haunt Marco every day. For being miserable. Look to see if there are more chairs, and a few more waiters, this man brought a couple of new guests without notifying me. There's lots of money here. This one has great riches. Hey! And what are you two doing out here? Look, lady, the thing is that... Exactly. It's like he's saying. Yeah, yeah, look, go change your clothes right now, that this woman is driving me crazy. And you're late. Come on! Yes, ma'am. Well, we'll have to serve drinks. Let's finish it off with a couple of drinks, don't worry. You've kind of taken a liking to stealing. What do you mean with stealing? Come, let's get a drink. I'm thirsty. Zoe. Zoe, answer me! I need Diego to be ready! Zoe! Zoe, answer me! Zoe! This girl is so stressful. Crap, just what we needed. Anyone would say that I am surprised. But I always knew that you were a drum head. A drum what? Don't listen to her. A whore, darling. A whore. As always, you're so nice and educated. I would like to say you look nice, but I imagine your phone has a camera. Be careful, drum head, I will bang you. Enough, please, enough. Tell me something, why don't you leave? Zoe is missing. What? You don't want me to catch up with my ex-friend? She already told you she left blue pills all around the place. Mom, dad, stop fighting. At least for today, it's my wedding day. But it's true. Control her, then. Come and control me. Oh My God! Oh, I'm sorry. I'll make sure to clean that, forgive me. Why don't you answer? Answer me! Diego is missing. - What?! - Diego is missing? Hey, how's it going? Is everything all right here? No. What happened? The groom is missing. He's missing? Damn it. I have another shotgun. Let's look for him. I left him in his room. But I searched in the backyard, the bar. He's missing. He's not in his room, he's not anywhere. This is disrespectful. Take it easy. I don't want you to get mad because of him. He went upstairs for a moment. He's gross. Ma'am, it's got to be one of those panic attacks he always has. Let's search all the house. In the room, the closet, the living room. Everywhere. Don't you panic on your wedding day? Okay, that's enough! Let's go find him, right now. Find who? Who do you think I am? A whore, darling, a whore. Zoe, go out and entertain the guests! - Me?! - Yes, you! And what you want me to do? Am I a cheerleader? I do not care, but they can't realize the groom is missing. Don't you think? Go buy us some time. Now! Let me think of what to say. Irma! Go with Carlos and Lola, please. Search around the backyard and the kitchen. This is the last straw! Let's see if you become friends again. Aldo, stay with Laura while I'll solve this. - Yeah, sure. - With me? No, I'm coming, too. Laura, you have your dress on and they must not see you. What dress?! That doesn't matter. I have to look for Diego. But my child, I've heard that it's bad luck to see the bride with the dress on. This is my wedding, uncle, and I will look for Diego. - You can't because they'll see your dress! - I don't care! I will look for Diego. Period. - I will go! - You got to understand! - All right! Let's go. - Okay, let's go. Good afternoon everybody. Good afternoon. How are you? Welcome. Good afternoon. We're obviously here because we're going to celebrate the love between our beloved Laura and Diego, and that's what we're going to do. We have a short delay. Something really short, nothing else. But meanwhile, you deserve a distraction because you are our guests of honor. I'm really grateful that you're all here for Laura and Diego. Well... Here we are, and I'm going to delight you with a little piece, while we wait for the happy couple, because today there's a wedding! No, right? No, that's not my thing. But what did that drink do to you? Are you drunk? Boy, what's that stuff that rich people drink? We must take advantage and drink all we can... Regarding what we were discussing. Listen, every problem always has a solution. Right, like us, that we ended up here, disguised as waiters, hiding from a robbery we didn't commit. - Well, come up with a solution then. - I'm jinxed! Hey! And who are you? I don't know you. Do you know all the waiters? Sure, who pays the payroll? The thing is we came, but the corner was bent, and the street was straight... Exactly. And suddenly... A company hired us! Exactly. By the way, congratulations on your wedding, miss. Yes, thank you. Ah, you guys are the ones Zoe called for Aldo's new guests. My guests? Exactly. Unexpected guests. Yes, the parachutists, those who arrive without warning. That they are not invited, but they suddenly come in and enjoy. Gatecrashers. Okay, I need your help. Yes, whatever you want, miss. Just ask, you might get it. I need you to help me search the house. Are there mice here? No, the groom who is missing. That's a big tragedy. Who runs from a beautiful girl like that? You're falling in love already. Of course! You, go with Laura. You are coming with us. Yes, ma'am. Search around here. The guy down there. You'll guide me, okay? I know. I know what you want, because you came to celebrate love. Do you want a wedding? Do you want a wedding? And you, you, and you? Do you want a wedding? Do you want a wedding? Do you want a wedding? And you, you, and you? Do you want a wedding? Do you want a wedding? Do you want a wedding? Want a wedding, want a wedding, want a wedding? - You want a wedding. - What? - You want a wedding. - Me? Want a wedding, want a wedding, want a wedding? - You want a wedding. - What? - You want a wedding. - Me? Want a wedding, want a wedding, want a wedding? - Who wants a wedding? - What? - Who wants a weeding? - Me! Want a wedding, want a wedding want a wedding? - Who wants a weeding? - What? - Who wants a wedding? - Me! Want a wedding, want a wedding, want a wedding? - You want a wedding? - What? - Who wants a wedding? - Me! Want a wedding, want a wedding, want a wedding? - Who wants a weeding?! - What? - Who wants a wedding? - Me! Want a wedding, want a wedding, want a wedding. My God, show up. We're late. There's really no reason to disappear the day he's going to marry you. You don't have to be so formal. Well, there really is no reason for him to disappear the day he has the joy of marrying you. Diego, Diego! Where is that idiot? And why do I have to be looking with this crazy woman? What a silly girl. You believe so? Do you think he fled? They have been in love since kindergarten. - That's dangerous. - Yeah, what's your name? - Jaime. - Aldo. A pleasure. Stop with the introductions, we have to look for Diego! Do you remember that phrase that they told us? "Until death do us part." Irma, please. What? So much planning and organizing for a fool to come and ruin everything. Sometimes you ruin everything yourself, and solve it by luck. Exactly. On the subject of luck, let me see if I got this. - Talk to me Irma. - What is it Aldo. Where did this guy go? - Irma, did you talk to Caligula? - Let me get his wife away first. You see, there is no good reason for your fiance not to be here with you. Everything will be all right. Yes, everything will be all right. That's what I think. What?! - Whatever you think, you're wrong. - What happened? Too many groceries in one place. Oh well, it was true that he was in the closet. Sorry. Excuse me. Laura! Laura, I need to explain but I don't know where to start... Laura, you know I love you. But I don't know, the pressure of being together so many years. I'd never hurt you, you know I love you, Laura... You love her like a sister... - Don't touch me! - You know I would never hurt you. Take her away. Laura, I need to talk to you. Laura, I must explain... Oh, please, I don't care what you enjoy in this life, but to wait for my best friend's wedding day to have an epiphany? Patricia, I just need... He's completely out cold. Watch out, he might spit his balls! Take him out of here where the guests won't see him. I'll fix this. God damn prick! Come on, boy. Castration would've been better, huh? Brother, help the boy. Let me answer this phone. Come on, move your feet. This can't be happening. This can't be true... - Calm down. - This can't be happening to me. Here, drink some. I don't understand how I could be so blind. How did I not see it? How did I not notice? Because in life there are people who know how to pretend very well. Yes, that was it. It's just that deep down, I feel like I've always knew this. Well, if it helps you, there are many people who have been through the same thing. Me included. Really? Yes. Although, obviously not in circumstances like these. I had a girlfriend during many years and we were going to get married. But something inside of me always told me that things were not right. And people would warn me. They told me: "Johnny, that girl is not good. Open your eyes." Open your eyes... And one day I opened a door, and I saw it. I got over her, obviously. Well sweetie, family is family. The most frustrating thing was to find out today. No. Even if it hurts, and believe me, I understand, The best thing that could have happened to you was realizing it, and not condemning yourself to live deceived. Yes, it's true. Are you sure? Thank you. I feel better. I'm Johnny, an Espumosa in Altagracia. Really? Of course not! I don't want to be inconvenient, but what will happen with all those people? I don't care much about the people. That's why I have Patricia. There is something else that worries me more. What is it? How will mom and dad take it? - We've been going around for hours. - Carlos. And with this woman behind, who does not leave us alone. Carlos. I'm tired of this. They think that I'm a joke. Well, I do think that you're a joke. She should get some alcohol injections to see if she looks better. Sure, just like your yoga instructor shot you. I have too many pending things to be here doing nothing. Weren't you leaving? Well, I... - You're not leaving your daughter's wedding. Because for you it's more important to leave with this waste of silicone, right? God damn it, Carlos. Oh, my love, now I understand why you left her and didn't go back to her. After enjoying something wonderful, it's hard to go back to something hideous. Be careful with what you're saying. Be very careful. Anyway, since this dumb ass is not going to leave you, I must ask for a favor. A favor? I think she's more drunk than I thought. But it's not for me, it's for Aldo that needs a big loan. Are you losing your mind? But he will pay immediately! But he needs it today. Well, look, Carlos is not going to give my money to that farmer. Your money?! My money. The money for which we've worked together. Ah, sure, working hard with your mind and body, right? Say what you will, that's my money. I let him give it to a... - Look, you damn old lady! - Hey, fuck! Lola, Lola. Don't talk to her like that. Don't do that, because that thing, which no one knows how it breathes since it's more dead than alive, that's my daughter's mother and I'm going to be eternally grateful that I wasted fourteen years of my life married with that. So please, respect her. All right, honey, but I will tell her something. We have the money, and we could give it to him, but I don't want to, because that's my money. You know what? Over my dead body. And tell your little brother to go beg someone else. Over my dead body. Girl. How do you feel? Well, as good as I can be. No, girl, stop thinking about it. Hello! What happened? Did the man show up? Look, if you want a better show than the one I gave there. I danced, I sang, I rapped. I even came out in love. What happened? It's a bit complicated, honey. But is everything all right? Oh, she's like that with everyone. It can't be... What's going on girl? What's wrong? You don't want to know. We have to find a way to get rid of all these people. What was that?! Conde! Who?! Follow me! Where? Run, dammit! Come on, let's go! Run! Oh my God! Help! Hey, wait... Damn, are you insane?! Help! Help me! Not that way! This way, this way! Over here! She's going to lose 15 pounds in a second! What's wrong, uncle?! Come. Get in here. Wait, what about mom and dad? I'll find them later. And I have to find Marco, too. I'm going with you. - Uncle, someone's shooting up there. - Don't worry, the can't see us in here. No, please, don't! Quickly, quickly! If you insult me, you must be tired of living. Let's reload. Where do you reload this fucking thing? Excellent! Lola! Carlitos! 447 to dispatch. Come in, 447. What do you want to report? We have to talk to the person in charge of the casino's robbery. Copy that. We'll talk with those in charge. Quickly, quickly! I'm going all in. What's going on here? Gentlemen, please relax! What the hell? - Something told me this would happen... - Don't worry, what's going on? Nothing, nothing's going on. Quinto, please, tell them to lower their guns, help me. - Why should I? - Don't lower your weapons. - You said this was a safe and discrete place. - And it is, Massimo. Ask them who they are! He's asking who these people are. This is my family, sir. Hey, hey, this is my cousin Laura, her 2 best friends and a waiter. A waiter... No, I'm a programmer, I mean, yes, I'm just a waiter. Marco, didn't you say Chinatown here and all those guys were Aldo's guests?! Patty, honey, help me please-What do you mean with Chinatown?! I have a tiny problem here and I want to fix it. You brought all these guys here to gamble during Laura's wedding. Great! Yes. - Don't aim at me, I've got nothing to do with this. Wait for me! - Right, let's keep going. - Please. - Quinto, right? - Put it down, put it down. - Please tell them to lower their guns. - This can't be happening to me. Marco, I don't know what you did to get into this mess, but on my wedding day? Calm down, people! Laura, cousin, it's not what I wanted... The thing is I made dealings with the wrong guy, I brought dad with me and now they won't... - The point is, shouldn't you be getting married? - Don't push that button. - It's the worst day ever. - Cut it out! All this talking is making me lose my patience, if you don't play along I'll be the one to shoot you. Are you threatening me?! Watch out, drop the fucking gun! Enough! I don't know if you know this, but today was my wedding day, my perfect day, and it has been a huge mess. First, I found my boyfriend with a bartender getting the fucking honeymoon started, a whole mess out there, my cousin's in trouble, the other guy is a liar, I'm tired of everything that's happened today. Drink, get naked, play, get hammered, do whatever the fuck you want but drop the fucking gun, I've had it for today. What a movie... It's clear to everyone that the girl has had a very difficult day. - Let's calm down. - It's true. Tony... Drop the gun. There you go, let's play. Let's play. Tell the waiter to close the door and bring a few drinks. What do we have, all good? - Are you sure that's the one? - Yes sir. They're going to the town. Good, let's go. And why are they looking for this guy? My miserable and irresponsible son got into a betting problem. Since you came clean, I'll come clean too. Go ahead. I'm not a waiter. You're a bartender? No, no, no, not at all. If you think you're in trouble, let me tell you about myself. It could have been worse. Really Laura? With everything you're telling me? He could have waited until we were married with children to cheat on me. Oh no, no, no, cut it out. Cheers, it's all behind you now. I don't know what I'll do when I get out of here. You can start there. - What? Please... - He seems nice. Laura... May I serve you? So, you are a "waiter", huh? I can give you an explanation. I don't know what your story is, and right now I don't care. Excuse me, thanks. And your sister and the husband didn't leave after all these gunshots? Ex-husband, he's riding a white Jeep that hopefully wont break down. My sister can't leave, it's her daughter's wedding. - Run, run, run. - He's going to kill me! - Go, go, go! - Wait for me! She's crazy! Look who it is. How can this be?! Wait for me. Meet my sister. - She's feisty. - Come here. Well... That guy doesn't know how to play. - What do you got? - Trio of 2s. I'll fold. I'm actually a computer engineer, a programmer. I told you I didn't care. And I'm here because of a complicated situation. Drop the gun, Irma, drop the gun. - I told you she was dangerous! - She's crazy, help me! Shut the fuck up, you're not getting away. Please don't kill me. Irma, you're mad! This can't be happening, Irma! Irma! Oops, I dropped it. I was joking! I love you a lot, I love you! She dropped it! Let's go! Stop there! Remember your daughter is getting married today, - are you going to do this? - What do I care? Stay where you are, don't move. Killing 2 persons at a wedding? Don't worry honey, the first one slides in like a charm. Don't move! Put the gun down, Irma, please. - 3, 2, 1... - Irma! What? Hi little brother, how are you? I'm getting something done here, wait a second. - Can she leave the psychiatric ward on her own? - Can't you see she escaped? - But what about her meds? - She self medicates. Let me medicate her. - Miss Irma. - What? Calm down, calm down. - Let me talk to you, excuse me. - Yes. I'll propose an exchange. - I'll shoot this way. - No, no, no, look at me, look at me. Focus on me, look at me. Aim at me, right here... There you go, exactly. Look, I heard you like alcohol. More or less. You've found the perfect guy. I'm your ideal partner, I'll make you a drink and I'll exchange it for your shotgun. - I'd rather kill them. - No, no, look at me, Mrs. Irma, look at me, look at me. I want to trade that shotgun for a drink. A tasty drink! There you go, calm down. Just imagine your drink, rum sliding down ice, and then running down your esophagus, you like that! - But not just one drink. - No, no. How could it be just one, if it's already prepared? Imagine, imagine, because you deserve all of that and more. Do you like that? Just hear the ice. - Can I have it? - Okay, alright. Thank you! What if you give me this and I make your drink on the rocks? On the rocks...? You're really nice, you know? And you deserve a tall glass, filled to the top. Let's drink, brother. Damn, he dazed her. Well honey... This Bastard has me dazed. What will you do after this? With you? Nothing. That's gotta hurt! Relax, relax... No, no, no, don't be like that. - You won, Marco. You mocked us. - Pay up, gentlemen. Spit it out, come on, I haven't got all day long. Come on, Italy. What's going on here? Put the gun down! Put the gun down! Sir, please drop your weapons, fuck, put them down! Please, gentlemen, please. I don't know my grandson, drop those things! Calm down, put that gun down! Dad, dad! Put the gun down! Dad, dad, please, tell him to drop his weapon. Wait, Marco, did you take the money just to bet it away? Yes, dad, we won. No, no, no, no, you bastard! You got into a fucking mess because of betting, I told you not to bet and you stole that money like a street-level thief? Marco, what's that nonsense? Are you playing with other people's money? - Wait Quinto, that's not... - Yes it fucking is! That's true! Thief! You know there's a code, and to me words are sacred. - A player's word is sacred! - Don't get romantic, I won fair and square. Dad, please help. - Here's the money we needed. - Money we need? The money you need, rat. This is over, pack it up, I don't play with thieves. I thought we were in trouble, but that kid's in a lot worse. Marco, you're not even good enough for pigs to eat. - Conde will kill us, dad. - Who? Come here, did the groom appear? What time is the wedding? Fuck... - You're a bad little birdie. - Dad, I... You appear to be friendly but... - Dad.. - Shut up, I've had it with you! You're no different, a bunch of crooks, always getting everyone in trouble. That's true, you're unbelievable. Stop with the drama! Dad, get uncle his money. No, forget about it. Thank you kid, but I think there's no time left. That guy won't want a wire transfer. Good luck then, we're leaving. Let's go, walk. - No, no. - No one's leaving here! - Conde! - Hi Aldo! Have you got my money? Conde, look, the thing is... There's been a lot of issues, I've got half of it, if you give me an account number I'll have it by tomorrow. Hey, wait, wait. - You mean to say you don't have my money. - Wait, Conde. Okay. Hands on, boys. Boss, boss. We have the money, but it's out there. And you are...? We're family. Family, that's what's important, your money is out there. Oh, "family." You came to support the cause! Get me my money. Cell phones, cell phones, give me your phone! - Cheap thief. - Cell phones. Take me where my money is, the rest of you can stay. No, no, my God... Hurry up, where? - Wait. - Where is it? - Hurry up! - We're almost there. I don't get why you told me to put it in. When did I tell you that? Why the fuck did you make me do that? - Cut it out, cut it out. - We're going to the end of the world. Look, here's your money. Here? That's nice! Well done, boys, well done! You surprised me, Aldo! You thought you'd make it out alive. Wait, what do you mean "thought I'd make it out alive"? With that money and the money in my bag you're set! Yes, that's a ton of money, I think that covers it. Boys, check the van for something to tie them up. Look at where that fucking game takes you. What's that? - Nothing! - Let me see. - Let me see, let me see! - Don't touch me! - Calm down, calm down. - Give it to me. Where did you get this from? - You really want to fuck me up? - You're the one trying to fuck us over. Do you know the sacrifice we made to buy that land - only to have them come and steal it? - That's enough! No, no, the van has the keys on, come on. Wait, wait. - Let me untie first. - But please! Fast! Fast! Get that in! Come on, fast! - Untie me! - Calm down. Get in, boss. Calm down, calm down. - Come on, what's going on? - It won't start, boss! Shit! Over here, over here, on the other side. - I don't know where they went. - Police! Police! Everyone, hands up! - Boss, it won't start! - Hands in the air! Shit! - Freeze! - Hands up! - Hands up! - Come on! I can't see those hands, get them up! Hey... We get a call from a house and look at who we run into, you're getting rusty, Conde. - "Getting rusty," idiot. - Take him away, boys. Get out of there, let's go! Come with us. - Let go of me. - Greed rips the bag, Conde. Damn, stealing a casino? Idiot. What robbery? What casino?! Take him away, take him. - What robbery? What Casino? - Take his gun. - What robbery? - Hands up, hands up, come with me. Let's go, let's go. I don't owe you anything. Damn, dad, they took the money away. - They took my title. - Don't worry, the police has it. It'll be fine. A promise is a promise, here's your money your title and this, which belongs to someone, I don't know. Don't worry, I know whose it is. - Take him away. - Let go of me, what's going on? Manuel, will you betray me? Let go of me. - What's going on? Quit it. - Cheeky bastard. - Mr. Aldo, is this yours? - My pennies are safe. Mr. Jaime, your title is in hands of the prosecutor's office, they said soon they'll press charges against the casino, - so it's all solved. - Alright. Thank God and you, officer. I'm the one who's thankful for your call, otherwise we wouldn't have known who the crook was. - Want to have some coffee with us? - I'd love to, but I've got things to do. - Thank you, officer. - My pleasure. We solved the problem. We did, we solved them. - What about your son, Marco? - He's learning life is no game. - Cheers, girl. - Now we're talking, aunt. You'll make a new family, hopefully you have kids soon. - Look at your daughter. - Let's toast for those involved. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hopefully they give you a grandson. - Let's get in the pool. - In a bit. - In a little bit. - No, you're so old. Come on, let's jump in the pool. Hey, hey, hey! - Come here, come here. - No, no, wait, wait. - Give me my drink. - No. - Give me my drink. - Molotov, don't jump into the pool. Give me my drink! Hey, give me my drink! - You can't drink! - Of course I can. - What do you want? - The drink! Okay, okay. Excuse me, good afternoon. How's everything around here? How's... How's everything...? Very close to the camera... Mr. Jaime, your title is in hands of the prosecutor's office, - They said they'll soon press... - Come on! If it weren't for that call I... Damn! Wow, I had never made two mistakes. Wow, forgive me people. You never learn, Zoe Altagracia! You're always late! This God damn thing! I hate it! All good, honey? Yes, I did it on purpose to see how it looked. Zoe, speak with the providers to see if they send... Let's see what we can do, it's not easy. - I know you can do it, get it done. - Yeah, so?! Don't count on me! - I love you! - I hate you! I don't care! Do you want to kill me...?! - Should we cut? - Yeah. Mr. Jaime, your title is in hands of the prosecutor's office, they said soon they'll press charges against the casino... Go back Freddy. Attention Director, we go on to take 32, Miguel, help him. Damn! I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. - It was part of the scene! - Sorry! Do you remember that phrase that they told us? "Until death do us part." - Irma please... - What? My dress got hooked! - Everything will be resolved. - Thank God and thank you officer. Thank you for letting me know. If weren't for you we'd never know that Jaime... Sorry. Director, we can give you a break if you need one. I don't care if you like what you like, but waiting until your... Again! Ah, sure, working hard with your mind and body, right? - Look, you damn old lady! - Hey, fuck! I won't allow you to talk to her like that. She's my daughter's mom and I'll be eternally grateful for having wasted... eternally grateful of having wasted... I'm thankful to all of you. If it weren't for that call, I'd never... Fuck! I can't, I need to blow my nose. Hey hey! What's going on?! Hey! - Do we do it again? - Yes. I noticed that the boom is shadowing the light. Okay. Okay! How pretty! Yes, thank you! I'm pretty. I'm gorgeous. I'm tasty. - And cheered! - What's up with you? Edible, suckable and chewable! Damn, he dazed her. Thank you for calling me. If it weren't for you, we'd never know that he was there. Together with kings! He did say that! It gets tighter! I can see the cable down there. Okay but that's a cable issue.. - The cable should seek its camera! - Let it look for its camera!
