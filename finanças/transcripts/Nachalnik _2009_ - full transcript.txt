Well, Igor, what are you doing, eh? Well, come on, come on. Hey, where are you going? Igor, that's enough, the child will catch a cold! Matvey, don't run too hard, son! Pass it! Come on! Well, the lights are on, but nobody's home, Igor? Well, of course. Igor, well, he's been ill recently! Now he'll sweat and get sick again. Well, that's enough, that's it! Stop it now! Are you crazy, Igor? Well, I'm sorry, Lena. THE BOSS Well... have a drink? No, I won't, it's bitter. How do you know that? And he winces when he drinks. - Did you see that? - Smart. Well, let's drink to the mind! Come on! Wow, like an adult. Hello. Hi. What do you want? Who are you? Don't spit in the house! I asked: What do you want? Do you have any money or gold? Don't yell, you stupid bitch! Don't yell! And shut your damn baby up! Sit down, you idiot! Sit down! Calm down, everything is fine. Calm down. Come on, calm down. Calm, calm, calm. - Sit down, are you blind? - Calm down, calm down, calm down. Igor, I asked you to sit down! Shh, shh, shh, it's okay. Everything all right. Like this. And don't make any sudden movements. Sit quietly and smile. Well, what's up? Money, gold? What are you freaks doing... messing up the house? I'm an FSB captain. It means not poor. What are you laughing at, asshole? Gone! I'll give you half an hour to get out of the region. Sucker! You think you're talking to harmless assholes? We told you: get out the bread! This is a summer house, you idiots. There's nothing here. Do you have any with you? Small. Well, let me eat it, then. Did you do it yourself? Shit. Money, bitch, money! Igor, please give them everything! Okay. Upstairs in my wallet. - A lot of money? - Yes. And here's on me another gold... Take it! Get the bread. Go upstairs with him. Go upstairs with him! Come to your senses. Come to your senses. Come to your senses. Are you standing? Are you standing? Okay, so listen carefully. Now we go down. Behave as usual. Do nothing. Don't move your eyes. Don't show any signs. If something goes wrong, I'll kill you both, okay? - Got it? - Yeah. Pick up everything. Pick it up! And a knife. Keep all this stuff in front of you so I can see it, okay? Let's go. Let's go! - Well, what's up, Water? - It's all right. - How much? - A good amount. Like clockwork. Drop the knives. Throw away from you with your feet. All right, cancel, boss, we got it. Face the wall. Take Matvey and go upstairs. Lock yourself in there. Hands on the wall. Spread your legs. Wider. More wider. More. Like this. - Sorry, man. - Shut your mouth. Let's go outside. Can you drive a car? Yes. Get behind the wheel. Sit down! And you're in the front. Where are we going? To the damn police station. For bread. Do you know the way to the city? Yes. We're off. Hey, boss. Let's not get snotty. You have to understand our situation. Imagine... they put me in jail for 3 fucking years for nothing. I decided to save a fucking woman on the street. I punched a guy in the head, and he's a cop. Easily locked me up. This bitch didn't even throw a claim. Released. Can't get a job. No family, no friends... no one will shake hand. Hopelessness. And he's completely depressed. Parents constantly drank, bullied him, the house is a mess, there is nothing to eat. And his father stabbed his mother to death in front of him. Figure it out. Pull over. Let's go to the forest. Let's go. On your knees. Don't kill me, good man! Well, don't be a fool, boss, why are you acting like a bitch? Help! Please help me! Someone help me! Shut the fuck up! I told you. I'm an FSB captain. Fucking bitches! Captain... FSB, Fuck! You've got to go to someone, you filthy brutes! To my house! My wife, my son under the knife! You're fucking arrogant, you fuckers. You'll drown in your own shit, you maggots! I'll wrap your guts around your throats. I'll crush you, you bastards! I will tear you violently! Scum! Punks! Bitches! Die! Die! Hey, neighbor! Hi. - Did you go for mushrooms? - Well, yes. Look. That's not enough. Well, yes, someone shouted in the forest? - What? - I said: someone shouted in the forest? Oh, just got lost. - So, how's your mother doing? - Better. Well, thank God. - Did you send the kid to school? - Well, yes. And our guy got sick. Missed it. Well, okay, it happens. Probably stay at home. - Maybe it's better this way, right? - Well, I guess. Well, yes. - All right, I'll go. - OK. Well, all right. By the way, come visit. Well, of course. Take Katyukha, kid. We'll sit together, make a barbecue, have a drink, chat. We'll be there, no problem. -Come on, come on. -Don't go there! There are no mushrooms. I did a thorough search there. Got it? Well, I'm waiting for a visit.
