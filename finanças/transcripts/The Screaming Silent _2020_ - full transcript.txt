Edmund Smuts did not rest in peace. He lay down in the dirt But he did not sleep. The sleep of the innocent is not conferred upon a soul so blackened So depraved, so cursed. He walks still between heaven and his awaiting hell. So wrote my ancestor Gladestone Michaels in his journal in 1830. I come from a long line of storytellers, it's in my blood and this story started 200 years ago When Gladestone, travelling to Van Dieman's Land in search of adventure and a story to write about found, in his words, a devil. Now, what he didn't write was that he shot and killed Edmund, shot and killed him at a church altar and married the woman he was about to wed. Edmund was rich but Gladestone didn't take a penny. He had his beloved Beatrice. End of story? No. Gladestone continues... "I do not sleep. Ever. Madness has my scent. He is coming for me. I think only one thought. I, too, am damned to the hellfire. My only hope of salvation is a blood redemption at the grave of Edmund Smuts. When the blood of Smuts flows one last time the Angel of Reckoning shall arrive. Only then will I be released from this covenant. I must act. Yet I falter. I cannot do it. I am doomed to burn. Gladestone never returned to the grave And this is where I come in. My ancestor started this story with a nib and a notebook. I'm going to finish it with my first feature film. Not now man, put it away. Brian! Two minutes man. It's going to go right over us. We'll do it later. Can we figure out where our ride is first? Yeah. Come at me. Holy shit! Come on. Come on, bring it! Wow! Damn it, I keep getting his voicemail. C'mon just do one for the website, right. We'll do it later OK? Can I at least get us a ride out of here? My name is Kurt Michaels and this is Minute One, Day One, Hour One Of production of our upcoming indie horror flick Blood Redemption. Three weeks ago I've cashed in my college fund and have bought two tickets for myself ...hang on... and Brian here To fly to this sunny place Sydney, Australia. To film the next big indie horror flick. It's going to be a wild ride so strap yourselves in. I'm coming. I gotta roll. Look at this. How are ya mate? - Awesome. - Yep. Here we go. Welcome to Australia. You guys don't mind if I have a surf this arvo do ya? No dude, I‘d love to watch actually. Can I try? Aaah… Do you mind if I take the car for a spin while you're surfing? You got a license? C'mon. I'm a good driver. A good driver. I'm sure you're a lot of things Kurt but… I'm terrified by this left side of the road thing. I've freaked out like three times. That's right, You guys drive on the wrong side don't ya - The right side. - The wrong side. - The right side. - Right side of the road. The best surfing beach in the world. No no, I've never seen an Aussie surf in Bondi. What! Who surfs there? Tourists mate. Like yourself. But you can surf there right? If you like waves probably not. I heard the dolphins actually surf there with you at Bondi. yeah cool. You boys want to shoot a kangaroo while you're down here? - No. - No thanks. Why not? They're so cute. Are you kidding? I'll eat it… Aren't I meant to be… I don't know, you could make some different movies movies in this car, you just attach the camera right here… Shit I've taken a wrong turn. - Now it's Backseat Boys. - Oh yeah. Oh Brian. Oh my God. Don't stop. You guys planning to shoot a whole bloody film on an iPhone? - No. - No this is just Part One of the documentary. People want something bigger. People want transmedia. Transmedia is what the people are hungry for. They want to be able to download what they want when they want it. So that's what we're going to give them. We're gonna give them what they want when they want so they can watch the movie and then they can watch us making the movie. Mate, I'm your guy. That's what I do. I shoot real life, I chop out the boring bits. I'm your man. You won't have to too much chopping with this idiot around. yeah why's that? Nothing's boring with Kurt Oh man I've always loved horror eh, can't get enough of it. Yeah. Like Japanese horror And ghost stories and shit? But what about French horror man? French horror? Yeah. That's where it is now. What's that? Like chicks with hairy vaginas? No it's like arthouse gore dude. It's like they totally see the beauty in death. Gladestone came this way. Following the rumours, the whispers. Looking for his big story. In the end he couldn't even tell his story. All he was left with was a dark, horrible, unspeakable secret. That he took to the grave. So you're the director? No, no, I'm just the producer. I'm the director. Yeah right and you wrote the screenplay? Pretty much. It's based on a story of an ancestor of mine so I just adapted that. Yeah wait a minute. The next.. the next Blair Witch is based on a story of something that happened in your family. Pretty much, that's exactly it, yeah. You're a sick puppy mate. Thank you. OK let's get this doco going. Alright um. Exit the car fellas. Australian soil. Feels good. It was just an injury. That's the only reason I can't surf okay? Maybe … maybe if I heal or something.. What is was was a dolphin that he thought was a shark. No it wasn't. Boys, boys! ooh! Hello… Is this stalking? Technically we've got a camera... No, no. It's not stalking if they want to be followed. Right? Erggh.. Want to be followed? Yeah, by the right guys. That might be the creep - iest thing you've ever said. Go on. Go talk to them. You talk to them. I'm not picking women up for you What are you talking about? We'll hang back. OK we're busted. Look he's still filming! What is with you and your cameras!? I mean I'm sorry for going off at you before. No no it's alright. It's just weird. It's weird! Yeah I'm sorry about the camera, that was Brian's idea. Oh thank you Brian Oh, no no no. Don't listen to him, he's an idiot. He's an idiot. He has this thing about dirty movies. He's been picked up on it before as well. You're sick. Douche! So what kind of movies you guys been making? Porn, mostly. Gay porn. Gay porn. It is actually First time in Australia. First day in Australia. Woah. First day! We have a lot to see. You guys are keen. Yeah, too much perving. Yeah, we've only got this guy to show us around. We're going down to Tasmania eventually but going to be here for maybe a week. Are you guys going to be here? Yeah yeah. We'll be here. She just lives down the road. Primo location guys What are you guys doing in Tassie? Oh not much just filming my... latest feature film. You're a filmmaker? Yeah it's actually our movie. He wrote it, I'm producing, Camo is going to be helping filming stuff. We're both actors so… - You're both actors. - really? - Yeah - In reality? Excellent! - We're actually holding auditions - Yeah we gotta go. In 2 days yeah and.. Yeah, absolutely. Guys, it was so good to meet you though we really have to go, we're in a rush. I mean, thank you for being our tour guides What? Is everything OK? We've wasted a bit of time here today so… He's … he's a kooky dude. I don't know, he has some… Was it something I said? No no no no. Never that, don't worry. I'll get your contacts, get it all sorted. Get everything organised and yeah, on Saturday. We're running out of time. Kurt. Shae will do it. You don't... You don't know that. We haven't seen her, she hasn't talked to us, her agent hasn't.. I'm nervous, man. This is a big gamble. On this one girl. That was a great opportunity. Yeah. I know, I know. Shae will do it. I trust you, it'll be fine. Yeh I know but… just let me have a safety net. Can I? - OK... OK. But Shae will do it. Hey hey boys, sorry to interrupt but who's Shae? Ah, he doesn't know, why don't you tell him? OK, Shae is the stunning female lead female lead to our film Blood Redemption. Yeah right. But what, she won't commit to the role or.. Well it's tough for her to commit when she doesn't know it exists. Her agent's blocking us, he doesn't like the whole indie movie thing… Look at this view. They give it to the dead! Kurt's had a hard-on for this chick that just won't quit. - Fuck you. - What, man? It's true. You wrote a screenplay for her. You won't see anyone else. Woah look at this. - Kurt Michael's film. - I call that obsessed. Died of... doubt and despair after lingering illness. - So sad. - If we don't have an actress we don't have a film. Shae will do it. I hope so Shae will do it. This is the Journal. The famous Journal. Holy shit. Show me. Yeah. My favourite's the next one. Turn the page. - What? - Look at the next one. Dude, this shit is messed up. That's the genocide man. Wait. Where's this set? Tasmania. Yeah right. And you're going to Tasmania? We're going to Tasmania. Package deal. I'm not so sure... what this stuff means but it came with the Journal so… You're a weird guy Kurt. How the hell did you get this through Customs? There's some ashes in here. I know, right? I have my ways. There you are mate. You can keep your weird shit to yourself. It's cool right? Mm-hmm. Just don't know what any of it's used for. Yep. How does it help? This looks like a tongue scraper to me. Did your parents tell you about this Gladestone guy? Kurt's an orphan. Shit! Sorry mate I didn't mean to.. No, no, don't.. don't flip out man, it's cool. It's part of life's rich tapestry you know. Sorry. Besides, my family's basically adopted him by now anyway. So you fellas are like brothers then? He's basically Dad's favourite kid. I reckon it's more your mom that fancies me. Hey! Can we leave the mothers out of this? You reckon I could meet you mum mate? No. We're here on business. Alright? Business. Down here? This one? Yeah. Here? Yeah. Just lift the latch. Really? Is there a light? Oh yeah. Be careful. Just don't electrocute yourself. There we go. This is exactly how I imagined my city production office, thank you. There's room to sleep upstairs this will have to be the office. - Alright. - Oh God Be careful mate, we found a dead rat in there the other day. - I'm really serious. - We get next doors Wifi Are there spiders in here? No. You sure? No. Next question... where's your mom? Sorry but who's Shae? In the middle there. Under the blood. The blonde. So… there's no bookings. whaddya mean, what does that mean? It's just first come, first serve. Go get some tickets. Doors aren't even open man, it's alright. Chill man. It'll be OK. - Just chill. - Don't tell me to chill Brian, alright? I'm chilled. Ok? Let's get some beer. Yeah. Grab me a Fosters? "Don't worry Kurt I'll do your little film. And then I'll do you". When shall we three meet again? In thunder, lightning or in rain? When the Hurly-burly's done, when the battle's lost and won. Where be the place? Upon the heath. There to meet with… Macbeth! All hail Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter. Good Sir, why do you start in fear for that which sounds so fair. Speak! No stay… fuck! Fuck! Stay A little later. They must lie there. Go carry them and smear the sleepy grooms with blood. I'll go no more… I'm… Sorry, this is a changeroom. - Shae.. - Hi. - Hi! - You can't be in here, we just done a show. I'm Kurt, Kurt Michaels. Um, we met at Aaron Levy's party in LA. Aaaah… - Aaron Levy. - Aaron Levy's! Of course! So what are you guys .. out from L.A.? Yes. We just… We just came in. Actually. - Awesome. - From L.A. - Cool. And I'm.. I'm.. Well I'm ready to do our film. Sorry? Um. OK so you remember at the party how I told you that I was adapting an old family story to a script. Well I finished the script and.. And we've tried to contact your agent a bunch of times Um babe. I'm gonna go get a drink - and say hello to a few people so.. - .. we haven't heard back.. I'll see you in the foyer. But it's such a good project and I think you would just... well I think it would be great for you. Have you got any other actors or anything? Oh you'd be starring opposite me. really? You're an actor? Yeah remember? Actor slash director slash writer. Right... That's a lot of slashes. Look guys, I am so flattered but I'm going to save you some time. I've done this kind of stuff before and .. Just, just get coffee with me. Right now. We'll go grab a coffee and I'm actually running late to meet a friend I'll go through it with you Aaa… Sorry… but I.. yeah. Tomorrow! Let's do coffee tomorrow. - Umm. - Or a drink? I'll buy you a glass of wine and, and look, honestly, it's not just for me, it's for you. Kurt, I'm actually very flat out at the moment, my... - Five minutes! - I, I really I really appreciate it. Alright four I'll settle for but three is out of the question. Yeah. I.. I'm sorry... I can't really. Thank you though. Can we.. maybe call a cut? Don't worry about it bro. You'll get your film made. She couldn't even remember my name man. She forgot it twice. I reckon you've dodged a bullet here. You know what I mean. I mean think about it. Think about how many actors there are in the wings. I mean.. who are dying to be in a film like this. I gotta story to tell you. Awesome. Human ivory. What? Yeah, in the 1820's there was an illegal trade in human relics like carved skulls and... Careful... and aah, scrimshaw bones and that kind of thing. Yeah, cool mate, but I don't think that kind of shit really happened here, you know what I mean. Here. Gladestone knew that, right? OK but, but.. then he discovered something really weird. He traced the human cargo back to this European living in the backwoods of Tasmania. Edmund Smuts. Ah right... the freak. Yes, freak.. but it's not what you think alright, he's not some mountain psycho walking around in, in human skin panties full of his own crap you know, he, he.. he was a mayor of a local mining town. He owned everything. And this human flesh trade was just a sideline hobby of his. Seriously fucked up mate. Right? So... Edmund ruled with this bloodthirsty terror. Right. He would've had corpses hanging from these trees. He just slaughtered people. That's seriously fucked up but it's still not a movie. What's not a movie? The Journal. So... Did you tell him about the Curse though? Wait a minute.. There's a curse? - Fucking.. - Ow! Spoiler alert man. C'mon! Nice one! You didn't tell him? That's the best part! No. Alright. Here, gimme that… Human bone. One of Edmund's victims. No this is Edmund. The uh, the locals as revenge put a curse on him. To say that when he was buried a demon would be summoned. A demon. - Yeah. - Yeah, good one. And Gladestone believed that? Aah, well all I know is that somehow he thought that this would save him from his own fate. It all had to be buried together. He thought that this box of shit would save his own arse. Oh yeah. You better believe it. That's right. Blood Redemption... One man's attempt to atone for the sins of the past. OK, I take it all back. You guys have a film. But.. don't you think it's a bit deep for horror? Oh it's alright. We'll dumb it down. Speak for yourself. so what's so good about this guy? Lots of th.. He's got a really good eye. Some of his stuff like.. Freaked me out. What's he made, movies or something? Yeah, yeah, he's done everything. But he was an old war photographer so.. - He knows his stuff. - Cool. Does he have his own kit? - Yeah. - OK. Just a sec mate. Uh, so.. So Grant, I've seen all your work, um.. those pictures you took in the war were.. The guy in Mistrata, with the eyes full of despair I mean.. We're shooting a horror so it's all about suspense and fear. Got any kit? Nada. Budget for an assistant? Um… What about him? That's.. no he's filming the doco so.. He'll have his hands full. In that case it'll be you two then. I'll need extra batteries.. You can fix me up for those. So, so .. shall we go and look at the script? Nah, not interested mate. I know that shot you're in love with. - That fella in Misrata right? - Yeah. He died while I was filming that, you know. C'mon Shae, just look, read the script. It's that simple. Why not? Seriously Kurt, there are like a thousand other girls that would jump to a film No I don't want anyone.. I wrote it for you Shae. OK, you wanna be big right? You want what I want. You want success. Of course. Who doesn't? Yes exactly, everybody. Everybody wants success. But you can't just, just knock on the door and wait for it - to open, you gotta bash it down. - I get it Kurt, I was in L.A. for 2 years. I've did it there, a cattle call every other day. Fuck L.A. You don't need L.A. I got 2 ads and a walkon - in a pilot the whole time. - You're, you're something special, you just need to take a chance! It's different for you Kurt. You can knock until it opens but I've got a clock on me and I can't ignore it so.. Wait, so you just think your looks are just going to fade out before you get your big break, is that..? Yeah. I booked a ticket. I'm going back to L.A. If I can't make it in a year then that's that. - What?! No! - I just really not.. You repeat offender. I'm really not in the same place. I'm sorry Kurt Look Shae, every morning, every morning I wake up and I feel like a fucking genius, like an inevitable force and… in here I, I... Great. No, no it's not some hippy affirmation bullshit, OK, this is the real deal and I want you to feel that way as well. I really do. Ok, what about that, that, that experience that your audience is craving huh? Is, is starving for? To, to, to kill your enemies and fuck your lovers and agonize in your heartache huh? How are you going to deny them? You don't understand at all. Shae, I think you can give that to them. I do. Alright. But you're going to run away and hide in L.A. C'mon! I wish that I could live in that world that you just described. It doesn't happen like that. OK. I'm sorry. It's back to work for me... C'mon Shae I'm serious. Please. Don't come back again. OK, you have my answer, no means no. I.. Aaah… c'mon, let's go. All right. I love our job. I really do. - OK. - OK. Number one! No. - Right away? - Nope. OK She looks like Nicolas Cage. Yeah. No, no, alright, I gotcha. "Cagey". Yeah. - Two. - Two. Nope. No I actually got to talk to her on the phone and she seemed pretty nice. Just saying. Next. Right. No. This is Emma Stone. She's not even auditioning. Can you pay attention? OK maybe. No. I don't know… No, she has.. she has too many features. Oh OK, that's nice. No. What do you mean no? - I dunno. - No..? She looks like you. Who's that? This one? No. You pointed her out. Alright. No, no, no. Here we go. Here we go. We have a winner. She looks like a goat. One eyebrow. - OK. - Next. You're annoyed with Mifanwy No, I dated a Mifanwy, remember, no! Why did you ever do that? That's re-treading emotional territory. Oh calm down. Nope. Little older than you. Uh-uh. She's nice. Yeah. He's a great guy. We did a film together. Thanks again so much again for coming down on such short notice. Thanks for having us. No I'm just glad we could work this out. Yeah. Well it sounds like a great project. Good. Yeah. And we've got everything all sorted out, we have contracts in place, all of our locations are all set up so we're ready to go after today you know. - So just casting? - Yeah! Yeah.

So we'll get you set up with that and then.. You know, down to business. - Thank you - You're welcome. So Kurt... it's a slasher. Um, well.. it covers the whole spectrum of horror. This isn't actually the script. It's a piece for the... the auditions. Bye Lauren. OK. Um.. Everyone... Thanks for coming. Uh, Brian? You wanna? Come with me. Good morning all. Alien fetus…? Yep? Alien fetus. Oh God! I feel its heartbeat. My flesh. Ok, I'm going to stop you right there. I just need it to be a bit bigger. Just a bit bigger.

Because I feel like you had a breakthrough today. - Really? - Yeah. Course I'm pissed. Why wouldn't I be pissed? Well because it was funny. - This was a shitty stunt. - And you were laughing. - I was laughing for the first three but you didn't give anyone a real script. C'mon man they didn't give me anything. A couple of them were at least committing. You gotta give them that. They were committed, I'lll give them that What did you do? I didn't. Katie was wondering if she could audition? - Script? - Yep.

The last few months have been.. Have been awesome alright? I've never met anyone like you before. Do you feel the same way about me? Yeah. I do. It's totally changed the way I think about everything, I was... I was waiting for so long to meet someone like you and.. And then I did and .. I guess you know what I'm going to ask next? Right? I, I don't want to rush you but.. I mean how long? I'm so sorry, I want to... Are you scared or something, are you still on your v-plates, I mean.. No. Is it to do with your dream? I can't... I can't talk about this, it has to stay inside my dreams. What has to stay inside your dreams? Just drop it please, if you care for me Dane. - Look if you just tell - You can't help me. You said my eyes were open… - before… - Yeah.. I was awake. No but… He visits me every night. Dane. I'm in that twilight moment just about to sleep and I feel him on me. I feel him breathing.

I try to struggle, I want to but my arms, they are like they are too heavy to move. It's like I'm paralysed. I can't… I can't put my legs back together. But he doesn't finish it off. He wants to delay his pleasure. No Chloe come here. To enjoy the waiting. You're safe with me. Alright. I promise. I'm sorry. - I can't keep going like this. - No, no. We're in this together.

Some weird number has been ringing me all day. I might do a VLOG. You know the expression "this film is the sum of all my compromises" well, I don't know who said that but I feel like they knew me really well. But then again… Kurt. Where the hell is your office? What are you doing here? Umm.. I read your script. You liked it? Aaah.. Yeah it's very dark… and strange. I don't know, I felt really um… yeah… Strange. All day after I read it. - Umm.. - So… So… I want to do this film. Kurt. I don't want to do, you know.. I don't need a blockbuster, I don't want anything more than this, this.. This interests me and it's very … true. So… Can you do that? Can you just give me this film? You..? I.. I mean.. Yeah. Really? Really. Yeah, OK. I solemnly swear that I will deliver to you upon my life a film that is full of truth and, and, note and, and substance and you will star in it and I will deliver it to the cinemas of the world. - OK. - OK. Thank you. Sorry. You just… you have no idea.. Aaagh You have no idea. OK. Awesome. OK? Shae. Would you like to step into my office? I would. Brian's going to shit himself. Sorry. Just in.. Sorry, do you want us to put it up here or down there? Nobody told me about filmin' on the boat. I'll read a little bit, anyway. Right. Alright. Ready? Yes. July 29th. "She had a distaste for the work. This man had.." This writing is so bad. Aaah.. something. So Edmund came down this river? No. Gladestone. - What? - OK This is Gladestone. He's the good guy. This is Edmund. Oh c'mon, they look the same! No they don't! And you're related to Edmund? No I'm related, I'm related to Gladestone, the good guy. OK. This is Beatrice. She was… Gladestone's beau but Edmund's fiancée. Yeah but she was married to Gladestone. No. That was after Gladestone pulled a total Mr Darcy on her. OK. Wait. Who's Mr Darcy? It's just someone else. OK so Beatrice … Beatrice is like this aristocratic debutante ...listen... Sorry. then her father married her off to this.. - guy.. - rich guy in Tassie. But, but … by the time she got here he'd died of pox so she was just left. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So Edmund wanted to buy all of this guy's land, that she was going to marry, and then he wanted her in the deal as well. Buying a wife and a house. - Yeah. - So he just bought her? - Yeah. He tried to. - Pretty much. How do you know so much? Because I've read the book. It's called a Journal. She's smart… sexy… insightful… brave… Incredibly courageous. - She's athletic. - OK she's just - very perfect. - She's blond. - Yeah? - Well she's like the the Madonna of the piece you know. - Yeah… yeah, yeah. - She's the saviour. - The guardian angel. - It's a bit boring. How about I look for some problems to give her? Some kind of, I don't know, something. - Something. - Yeah. Something.. kind of .. challenge. well look, we'll look at the script together later I gotta check on.. don't run away. I'm talking to you about this later. Yes we will I promise. Later. You Yanks.

What the fuck are you doing man? Grant? What the hell? Did we not get that? Course we didn't get that. There's no way in hell - we could use that. - Are you serious? If her agent saw that we are both fucked. Alright Katie. Katie … Another one? Kurt, no. One more. C'mon. No fucking way. Come on. Fuck. - There's no way we could use - We gotta move on anyway - could use any of that. - C'mon guys. C'mon. Yeah, look I'm sorry. I should have asked. I should have asked. I just, I want it to be the best performance it could be, you want that right? Well yeah! You should have asked me first. Yeah I know! I should have asked but I just didn't want to fuck up your focus. OK maybe if we just set up some ground rules then maybe in the future we'll be fine. I knew.. I knew you would say that. You're meant to trust your director. You have to earn our trust. Exactly. Try to get along. Try being a little more positive with your notes. - We're making an awesome… - Yes. What the fuck is the point of being here? Totally. It has to be awesome. Yes OK. So you agree with me. Yes I agree, Can we GO!? Oh… Fuck! Let's roll man. Shut up Kurt. We're on a tight schedule remember. - C'mon man, - Kurt, Kurt, Kurt. [Kurt let's do it. Kurt I don't know how I'm going to do this. As you said man we're on a schedule, we gotta roll so.. Could you just give me hand please? Where were you when I needed you man? You didn't have my back. You.. you were being a dick. Just keep feeling the wall with that hand and edge along. You're fine and I got you. Just keep feeling along like a crab. Like a crab. Like that? Like.. Be the crab. Perfect. You're doing really well. - OK. - Really well. Hang on. Guys, the sound sucks! Listen to this man. We have to film it here? In this place really? It's freaking me out. Yeah well OK there's something… here. We're going to capture it in the camera and it's going to be… exceptional. You're not helping me Kurt. Gladestone knew it. I wonder what Gladestone knew. What do you mean? I mean he only ever gave us half the story, what is he hiding? Nothing. He killed a guy. He had to be careful. He was obsessed with that curse. He was scared to death. He wasn't, wasn't scared. He never let it go. He thought that the ghost of Edmund had it in for him. You are Gladestone's descendant. You should think about that. OK. Here we are. In the Styx valley. What a place. I… I can't shake this feeling like I have been here before. It's so weird, it's like.. It's like a psychic echo handed down from my relative. You know Gladestone went right through here on his way to Edmund. He had his Journal, I have my film. I guess we're linked in that way. Except.. He never fulfilled his mission to reveal the horrors of Edmund to the world. Just think, when this film comes out that dream will be fulfilled. Nearly 200 years later I'm going to finish what he started. - It needs a love scene! - I know! I know. I agree. It does. But a sex scene however … No, it's not a sex scene OK It's completely tasteful. It will be filmed tastefully. Yeah. There's usually a way to do this you know. You go.. you talk to my agent, - you sign a contract.. - Yeah. you can't just chuck it in when we're about to do it. OK. Uh-huh. Yep. I mean what nudity is it? How much? How's it shot? I'm not hiding anything, it's in the script. It's not about the nudity. The nudity is just… It's a part of it. For me.. It's a part of it.. Yeah? Can that go? Were you even going to ask me? Yes of course. When? OK. Well it's fine then. - OK. Bye. - I'm making changes. I'm making changes. Good. - Sound. - Rolling. - You right Kurt? - Yup. Alright. 36A Take 3. Mark it. - Camera set. - Camera set. Action. You awake? I am now. I can't sleep. You must have a guilty conscience. I have sinned. Confess sinner. My thoughts.. Have been impure. That sounds serious. Have you given over to these impure thoughts? Not yet. But um… I fear I might. It doesn't look like you're trying very hard. I'm … fighting with every fiber of my soul. I'm not… ready. What're you waiting for? You have no idea of boundaries K.. Kurt. Oh.. Sorry. Dane. Let's go again. I lost focus. No. I was going to cut anyway. What's going on? What? You have some notes? Yeah I do. This scene is all about Chloe's powerful attraction to Dane and the fact that she wants to give over her body to him as well as.. - Kurt, you knew that.. - .. her soul. You knew that I saw her as still deciding at this point. OK, shes, shes deciding whether Dane is dependable. And safe. Why are both of you fighting me at every step of the way huh? You're not seeing the bigger picture at all, OK, it's .. You're holding back and your priorities are all… Roll again. Can I just have a moment? Roll again. You awake? I am now. Can't sleep. You must have a guilty conscience. I have sinned. Confess sinner. My thoughts have been impure. Well that sounds serious. Have you given over to these impure thoughts? Not yet. But I fear I might. Doesn't look like you're trying very hard. I'm fighting with every fiber of my soul. Not ready. Relax You have no ideas of boundaries Dane. No. I don't. Out here we make our own rules. What was that! Oh shit! Grant! Get up! Oh shit Camo! Grant, get up. What - There's something out there. What the fuck? Something weird out here man. Camo! Camo! Yeah. What the fuck is that? It's Devils. What do you mean "Devils"? - Tasmanian Devils. - Get them away! Get them away! Camo! What? What's going on? I should wake him up right? No man. You're not supposed to. You sure? Yeah just leave him. Did you hear that? What was that? Fuck this, I'm waking him. Fuck! Dude, is he still awake? No, no. He's out. So weird. Kurt. Kurt. Kurt. Fuck. Kurt where the hell are we going? He said he saw this place in his… dream. Dream? Do you have a map? I knew this log would be here. It's like being on a conveyor belt. C'mon. Guys! Nearly there. Wooooh! Look at this! I told you look at this. I told you. This is it. I told you this is exactly it. This is the exact place I saw. Let's set up Grant. Get the camera. Get it in the can. Cut! Cut, cut! Stop. Right here.

Hold still. Hold still. That's Edmunds fucking mark and she's not going to die for your movie. She's going to finish the fucking film. It's a movie. FUCK your movie! NO! We're finishing the film. No we cannot finish the movie with her like that. Can we please go home? No one's gonna die because of this movie while I'm.. KURT! Look at me! Look here! You are NOT finishing this movie with people getting hurt. You listen to me. What the hell happened up there? It's exactly the same as the Journal - Did you see what happened? - No I didn't see. He's fucking acting really insane, have you noticed? Yeah, you have? You're supposed.. I don't what to do about it. Aww fuck. He didn't find her. Oh… Have you looked everywhere? Went all the way back. OK.OK. She doesn't have a map or anything. What about the creek? Shae... go with Grant. Maybe you can find her around the falls. You didn't go all the way to the creek? What about … And shout if you see anything. Kurt, come with me. We'll go down here. Am I.. Am I coming with you? No, no Camo, stay here. Ah, holler if you hear anything alright man. She might come back to camp. Yep. Right. Righto. OK. Kurt, come on. Oh, what's that! Katie? Camo! Katie! What? Fucking hell. KATIE! Where are you? Camo! Katie don't move, I'll come find you.

I was so stressed about finding an ending to my film. I was obsessed with finding a twist. People are always talking about the endings of films you know "Oh I didn't see that coming" But the reason they like it is because… it's so like life… You know. You never do. Oh, it was recording. Hang on. - Holy shit! - What is that? See what that is. That's the fucking mark. Oh my god, can we please leave? Can we please get back to camp now? Katie.. Katie was calling his name. What's happened to her? The church at Tullochgorum. Edmund's grave. Uh-huh. He isn't going to just let us do this you know. What else are we going to do? He isn't… going to just let us go home. You know with you there's always been two films. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. The one I want to make and the one I have to make with you. - With me? - Yeah. Gimme the camera. I know why you like this thing so much. Because when shit isn't going your way, when you're having a bad day, And you're just out of luck you just look through your magic fucking camera And then ‘Hey!' you come out on top. Oh, now you get the last word, now you get the girl. Now you… you're the fucking film artist, the fucking primo artiste right? Yeah exactly. The artist. That's what burns you the most isn't it. Isn't it huh? I don't fucking care. Film's over. We're going home tomorrow. Maybe for you. I'm getting my ending. We can't go until we deal with this. You're kidding right? She's kidding. Are you serious? Do you see what is happening? you actually believe in this fucking curse bullshit? It's all shit. That's it, show's over, no more film. This is not the film where we all die. Thank you but no. - We're leaving in the morning. - Look around you Brian. C'mon Brian. You're writing the script now. You've got the next line. Shut up Kurt. Which one? Which one Brian?

Gotta go. C'mon. We should go. That tree… What… Yeah… What happened…? I have no idea. Let's just go this way. Kurt. Just stop… stop… filming. I'm giving you what I promised you. There isn't a promise anymore. There's no movie anymore. You want to be a star. You want to be someone. I am someone. I am someone! I'm Shae! Put it down please! Put the camera DOWN! Please stop that. Is that a church? That's it. Lets go. Oh, shouldn't we.. We go. We bury the shit. We leave. OK. Whatever you say Indiana Jones, let's do this. Guys …? Who's that? What is it? Look Oh God… Look at them all… What do they want.. They're his victims. Here's your horror movie Kurt. Yeah. He's here now. He's … I can feel him, he's … wants his Beatrice you know and he was going to walk down this aisle with her and… and … and he thought they were going to be together forever. Maybe there'll be some… records., Edmund's grave or something. He's not in there. They don't have anything. What'll we do? Let's find the grave. What are we going to do? We can't just keep looking What else are we gonna do!? We have to… Fuck! Guys… Got it? Oh shit… Oh! Oh wow. That'll do. Edmund Jan Smuts. Let's get it open. Get the box! I got it. Quick. Do I get ‘em out? - Yeah get them out. - Put the whole box in. The whole thing? What the fuck? Just dig! Let's get these bits. Chuck it in Brian. Do we aaah.. Say a prayer? - Just bury it Brian! - OK, OK. Now! OK. It's done! That's it. Burn in hell, ya fucker. Shit! Grant! didn't fucking work. It didn't fucking work! We must have done something wrong, I don't understand. No. We did everything right! We buried the fucking box. This curse is bullshit! No it's not. Course it's not! Gladestone knew what he was doing… Shut the fuck up about Gladestone, Kurt. You just stood there and watched Grant die like a fucking psycho. - Fuck you Brian you dont.. - What! Wait. Wait. Gimme.. Oh Shit. What? What? Let go. What? What? Noooooo. Shae. No Shae don't worry that. That's too small, that's not it. It is, it is… Ooooh my god Fuck off… Come here. Come here. Shae. Come here. Get the fucking box. Get the fucking box! What? Get the box! What the fuck? Kurt. Why are you the only one not cut? I don't know. Gladestone maybe? He's protecting me? Shut up about Gladestone Kurt. Did you get this ring from the box? Yeah. It was Gladestone's. So what? OK help me. What are you looking for? - Give me your ring. - What? Give me your ring. Now! Oh. Fuck. They're the same. That.. That isn't Gladestone's ring. It's Beatrice's. She was married to Edmund. No… - Yes! - No way! What do you mean it's all about me? You got it wrong OK? You thought you were the last descendant of Gladestone. - Yeah, I know I am. - You're not. Bullshit! Of course I am. All this stuff, all this stuff is Gladestone's. Yes it's Gladestone's but he isn't the father of Beatrice's child. What de didn't want us to find out was that Beatrice was pregnant with Edmund's child before he stole here away. What about all the junk in the box then? What's that for? He had to convince someone that… he'd killed the child. - Killed his own kid?! - Edmund's child. That's fucking crazy alright. That's insane. Why would he do that? Edmund was cursed. EDMUND was cursed. "When the blood of Smuts flows for the last time" What do you think that means Kurt? I don't know! I.. it doesn't mean anything! The blood of his children! His kids. His bloodline. His curse was to watch all his children die before he was dragged to hell. And then Gladestone shows up and takes away his unborn child. No way. You're Edmund's descendant. The fuck… You. You're supposed to be in the grave. Not his stuff. Kurt. You're the only remaining descendant of Edmund Smuts. That's why you're not cut. He doesn't want you here. He wants you out there making as many little Edmunds as possible. It's not true, alright! I'm his descendant. I'm Gladestone's … You're not his descendant Kurt. I'm his son. I'm finishing his story. Your ancestor was a killer. No alright. - NO! Give me the goddam fucking camera! Brian I'm finishing, I'm doing.. Give it back! I carried you forever. I gave you everything! You.. Had everything! You had everything! I had nothing! I had nothing. I just wanted one thing! I wanted one thing. My FUCKING FILM! Brian! Brian? Brian? Oh? Ffffuck! No. Hey? Oooh my God! Fuck! I'm a killer. I'M A KILLER, I'm Edmund! Fuck! God, a fucking killer. You're not Edmund Kurt. Edmund wants us to go. Let's go. He wins. Let him rot in purgatory forever. Let's go please. What about justice for his victims huh? These wandering souls… You're going to be my guardian. OK. Take the film. Ok. Rolling. Go. When I was young, a long time ago I… I grabbed hold of the tail of a tiger and I never let go. It spun around and around and it went this way And that way and it came after me and I grabbed hold even tighter. And it was hungry but I wouldn't let go. But today I'm going to let go of that tail. Today she gets to eat me. The horror. The horror.
