[startling music] [phone vibrating] [ominous music] - Look, you tell them whatever you've got to tell them, but I wrote it once and I'm not changing it again. Yes, yes, I'm changing it. No, we can run the package as it is. We don't need. Seriously? I get it. No, it's super important. Okay, but if. Guys, if. [horn blowing] [gasping] - She's awake. - Where, where? - [Doctor] Central Municipal. Let them know she's awake. What do you remember? - Why? - We need her in here now! - Why am I? - It's gonna be okay, just calm down, it's gonna be okay. [suspenseful music] No, sir, no, you cannot be in here. - Don't you worry about it, I'll only be a minute. [sighing] I'll be goddamed. Surprised to see me? - I'm sorry, I don't understand. - Sure you do. I'm Jim Krueger. And you, little lady, are in a world of hurt. - I'm sorry. There was a truck- - Was there? - Officer, I don't know what you think- - Let's cut the formalities. I thought we were more familiar, you and I, more personal terms. - I don't understand. - Let me be clear. I mean to see you put down like a damn rabid dog. That clear enough? I'm going to see you dead and buried before this year's out and that's a promise. - I didn't do anything. - Optimism. Good, I like that. Although them cops saw you kill their own might disagree with you. Eye witnesses, ain't that something? There's enough to fill a circus tent. You are fucked, little lady. - [Doctor] You need to leave now. - I'm just getting started. - Now. - Alright, take it easy, chief. I'll see you soon. - [Doctor] It's okay. I need you to calm down, need you come down. Can you breathe for me? Can you breathe for me? Take a deep breath. Here you go. Now, tell me what you remember. Go to your memory. - There was an accident. But I'm not in any pain. What do those men want? - Can you tell me your name? - Cora Fisher. - Okay, Cora. And what year is it? Do you remember what year it is? - It's 2009. - Okay. Cora, I have some difficult things to tell you. I need you to stay calm. Can you do that for me? You've been in a coma, the year is 2019. - Oh my- - [Doctor] It's okay, stay calm, stay calm. - I been in a coma for 10 years? - Well, no. An unknown doctor checked you in about an hour ago and placed you into a medically induced coma. - I don't understand. - That's about all we know. He left before the police arrived and could question him. - How did I not remember? He was, I was in an accident, it was an accident and I don't remember and it's been 10 years and I don't remember. - Now we've got that. We got here, it's right here in your file. It says that you came out of a coma after a severe automobile accident. 24 hours after the accident, you woke with amnesia. There was damage to your hippocampus, it seems, but it says here you went missing two weeks later. And that was 10 years ago. These guys are here because something's happened and they need to ask you some questions. - No, it's impossible. That's not possible. - [Doctor] I'm not gonna let them in until you're ready. - That's not possible. I need to see myself, please, I need to see myself in a mirror. - You can leave now. - Ma'am, out of all due respect. - You can go stand with the others. [tense music] - Doctor, I think you should look at this. [elevator beeping] [suspenseful music] [siren wailing] [glass shattering] - Surprise, look what we have here. [tense music] [shouting] [punching] [door creaking] [engine revving] [tense music] [bat clanging] [sword sliding] [tense music] [whispering] - White rabbit? Okay, enough of this horse shit. [men shouting] [sledgehammer smacking] [door knocking] - Can I help you? - I sure hope so. If its not too much to ask, would I be able to come inside? - You do you know what time it is, right? - And I'm terribly, terribly, sorry for that. It's just that I'm in a little bit of trouble and I used to live here a long time ago. - What kind of trouble? - Can I please just come inside and explain? - Yeah. Whoa, just precaution, when you say in trouble I don't want you bringing it in here. Take a seat. Explain, please. - I woke up this morning handcuffed to a hospital bed after being hit by a semi with 10 years of my life gone. I managed to escape but while I was trying to find help a shitty truck full of freaks in masks chased me and this is the only place I could think to come. - Well, that, that is a lot to take in. - No kidding. How do you think I feel? - My apologies. How about this, let me get some water, okay? Just sit here, relax. So let me get this straight, the cops handcuffed you to the bed. - Rangers. - Rangers? Wow, you must've done something special. - I just don't know what. - [Man] When you say you lost 10 years, you just don't remember them? And coming here might jar something in there? - That's my hope. - I just don't know what else I could do to help you, honestly, I mean, you hungry? Something else to drink, maybe? Some booze? [laughing] - Thank you but I think that's the last thing I need right now. - Hot tea it is. [kettle whistling] - Can I use your bathroom? - Huh? Oh yeah, just in the room to the right. [sobbing] I hope you like mint tea. [curtain pulling] [door knocking] - You okay in there? Your tea is ready. How about you come out, Cora? [banging] [toilet lid smacking] [door creaking] - Hello, Cora. [speaker voice muffled] If you think I'm just going to walk away, you're sadly mistaking. If you look around this room you'll find clues. You deserve this. Pathetic excuse of life. I don't care if you kill. - You know, that's not going to work. - What the hell do people want from me? - You people? It's not a short list, you'll have to be more specific. - You know damn well what I mean? - There's no going back, Cora, there's only the end. One of you must die. In fact, one of you will die. Any guesses on which is as strong? - Then why don't you just kill me? - Oh no, no. Do you think it's that simple, Cora? I'm disappointed. I mean, I won't pretend to know how all this works but you've got your work cut out for you. Besides she won't let me, for now. - So you're just fucking with me. [bat clanking] - Tick, tock. [man whistling] [tense music] [clock ticking] [film flickering] - So is it legit? - Hell if I know. Where they point to is where we go. So let's go. - You believe it? - That'll be the day. [police radio chattering] - So what exactly is this all about? - I think you forget you weren't around. Were you assigned to a homicide before this? - Yeah, six years. - [Cop] You heard about Pope. - Yeah, I heard about Pope. You see, we have reason to believe that- - Down at the end gonna curve to the left. We got an anonymous tip that some of these folks are holed up in a warehouse down here. - [Cop] Why the hell would they be down here? - Yeah, probably ain't. Probably a waste of my goddamn time. On the off chance Hyde is here, I got a couple of our boys waiting for us to take a little lookie-loo. Watch? - Yeah, 12 years. No thanks. - Yeah, I don't know what it is. Every time I cut the jaw candy from my diet only things that'll do is seeds. - [Cop] No tobacco? - Quit five years. That's a hell of a thing. Hang a left here. I think I could get over. Never get rid of your addictions. No, sir. You just quiet 'em for a little bit. - I never got into anything like that. - Nope, damn, been doing it most of my life. Can't imagine taking a long night like I used to without a plug. Funny thing is, reminds me of the bad times too. [lightning crashing] That's why I quit. It wasn't the surgeon general, I God damn guarantee you that. I got transferred up here, I said time to leave all that behind. All of it. - I hear ya. - All right, over here. - So hey, I gotta ask, who the hell is Hyde? - I thought you said you knew about Pope. - Well, yeah, I was down in San Antonio when I heard about that mess, but no Hyde. So who is he? What's the connection? - No one knows who he is. Some kind of fucking monster who wears a skeleton mask. - [Cop] What? - And he ain't just connected with what happened down there but a ton of other shit all over South Texas. He's the kind of sum-bitch you tag on site, you hear me? Then you leave him for God damn buzzards. Otherwise you gonna find yourself bleeding to death on some dirty fucking floor. Guys, y'all ready to do this? Let's go earn our paycheck. [tense music] [door shutting] - What else? - That's it, we went in. - Yeah? - Yeah, we went in, you know the rest. - How the hell did you let this happen? [gun shooting] [shouting] [whacking] [woman screaming] [man screaming] You get it, right? You gotta know what a God damn mess this is, Wheatley. You and your partner both displayed poor judgment and you're gonna have a lot of questions to answer for it. - What the hell took so long? - They had questions. - Yeah, well, fuck 'em. I got a call from hospital security. They got Hyde. - What the fuck, at the hospital? - Checked in about an hour ago, going nowhere. Let's go. [ominous music] [tense music] - [Girl] You should remember. - [Cora] What? - Phone books are damn worthless, you know. I'm not sure why they still get passed out. Old people, I guess. - I'm looking for an address. Wait, did you say I should remember? - Shouldn't you? - That they're worthless? I'm sorry. Do you know me? - Of course, I've seen you around is all, nothing formal like. I'd be careful at this hour, dangerous people out tonight. - Wait, have you seen me in this neighborhood? - Some. - I need your help. I was in this accident and look, I'm in trouble. - Where are you trying to go? You want to go there? - You know where it is? - I know where everything is. That's near the Pearl Creek. Shh. You hear? They're coming. We better run, come on, come on, this way. [ominous music] [engine revving] Come on! [heavy breathing] - Where does this lead? - Not much further now. - Do you know where you're going? - Of course, don't you? - Away from those crazy fuckers. - Why are they after you? - I don't know, some kind of sick game. - One hell of a game. What are the rules? - I don't know. [tense music] - [Girl] You gotta find out then. - Yeah, hey, thanks for your help. - Whatever, I didn't really think about it too much. - We better split up before they see you with me. It's dangerous, be careful. - Speak for yourself. - All the same. - Good luck. - Yeah, you too. - Come on, this way. - They're still out there. - Just follow me, be quick. [fire crackling] [dramatic music] - [Doctor] Do you remember your name? - No. - [Doctor] Does Cora spark anything at all? Does it bring back any kind of memory? - No. - [Doctor] When you hear Cora, what feeling do you get? - Nothing, literally nothing. - I can imagine that's really frustrating. - Can you? Have you ever been in a coma and lost all your memory? I know how to piss, shit and eat. I know that the shampoo in my room isn't actually good for my hair. I know that the food here sucks. And I also know that if I have to answer these questions one more God time I'm really going to lose my shit. - Cora, I empathize with your situation, I really do, but you need to try to remain calm. Okay, I'm merely trying to help. Do you know what empathize means? - Oh, don't patronize me, Doctor. I lost my memory, not my intelligence. - I apologize. I do feel compelled to remind you that we cannot release you until you've begun to regain your memory because- - Because it could be traumatizing to pick up a life you're unfamiliar with. Yes, I remember, it's everything before the accident I forgot. Stay with me, Doctor. - I think we should put a bookmark in it for now. If you could just- - Physical therapy, yes, I know. - No, go to your room please. I don't want you upsetting the other patients. That'll be all, thank you. [desk clearing] - Hey! No, no, no, no! [gasping] - Don't. - Hey, hey, somebody stop her! Cora! [tense music] - Cora? My God, it is you. You don't look so good. - Sorry I- - Hey, hey, it's me, Steve, Steven Marks. Holy shit, you don't remember me? - Listen, not your fault, I just don't really remember anything. - That's right, yeah, I read about it, the accident. So you don't remember me at all? We were practically high school sweethearts. I can't even imagine what this is like for you. Can I do something for you? Can I get you a coffee, dinner maybe? Must not have fed you in the clinic, huh? So you just walked away? - Mm-hmm. - And you don't remember anything about your past at all? - Nope. - Aren't you afraid that they're going to come get you? - You're not going to say anything, are you? - No, no, of course not. I'm just saying, I don't think they're going to forget about a missing patient. - What do you think I should do? And don't say check back in, 'cause it's not fucking happening. - Hey, easy. I was just going to suggest that you might want to lay low for a little bit. See if your memory comes back. - Well, it's not like I can go back to wherever my place is. I'm kinda fucked. - Well, you could stay at my place. I mean, at least until you figure out what the hell's going on. - You wouldn't mind? - No, I live alone, it's fine. I promise. Well, it's not much, but she's home. You can just sleep on the couch. I'll get you some fresh sheets. Need a hand with that? - What are you doing? - You don't remember, do you? High school sweethearts. - Practically. You said practically, practically high school sweethearts. - Sharp as a knife still. - I'm gonna go. - No you're not, you just got here. Ah, bitch! [woman struggling] Now, you listen to me or I'll call the cops. I'll tell 'em some crazy lady came, ow! Cunt! [coughing] - [Man] Can I help you? - I wanna learn how to fight. - What discipline were you thinking? Jesus, mixed martial arts, I take it? - No names. - Well I can't train you then. I'm sorry, it's a liability. I'm not gonna risk shutting down. - This shithole? I'm surprised you're not already. - Excuse me? Miss, I don't think you know- - I can help with that. I can help keep the place clean, keep my mouth shut. You keep yours shut and teach a woman how to kick someone's ass. - What exactly- - No questions. [slow music] ♪ I am searching ♪ Under water ♪ In the mirror ♪ I am changing ♪ I am breathing ♪ Rearranging ♪ Rearranging ♪ I am the fire ♪ I can feel the water through me ♪ [lyrics muffled] - What the fuck, Cora? What the fuck is wrong with you? [voices echoing] [bells ringing] - Coming, just hold your fucking horses. [kicking] [groaning] Please. Just take whatever you want. No, please! Cora? - No, it's Hyde. - [Reporter] Levels of gang violence in the city has increased more than 60% in the last few months according to officials. - [Reporter] These dangerous psychos want anarchy and chaos. You wear a mask 'cause you want to scare the hell out of someone, not sell them heroin. - [Reporter] In a statement, every measure is being taken to see that those responsible for recent deaths were found and brought to justice. - [Reporter] If you have reason to suspect that these deaths are related to a recent wave of gang activity originating in South Texas, we fully expect these criminals to be found and prosecuted under the full extent of the law in a matter of weeks. [chanting] [sticks banging] [sword sliding] - You had so much potential. Disappointment isn't quite the right word. Face me! No, betrayal seems a little bit more appropriate. Wouldn't you agree? I'm glad you think so. Oh, are you nervous? I can't imagine why. Yet each man kills the thing he loves, by each let this be heard. Some do it with a bitter look, some with a flattering word. Coward does it with a kiss. A brave man with a sword. - So now you'll have your lap dog kill me? - Are you familiar with Emperor Commodus? A man after my own heart. Fought many battles in the great arena, won them all. - He also fought wounded soldiers and amputees. A coward's fight. [punching] [voices echoing] [woman screaming] - Hello? - [Cora] I need your help. - Cora Fisher? God, I was wondering if this day would ever come. Here you are. I have to ask why now? - I quite like how I am and I prefer not to change it. - Oh, wow, after what is it, like 10 years now, you're starting to see flashes of your old life? - Is this amusing to you? - No, I'm impressed. I mean, this is a medical crapshoot at best. Quite frankly, it's a medical anomaly. - Well, I'm glad I could make your day. How do I prevent it from happening? - There's not like a magic button I can push and give you what you want. This is new territory. It's not like resetting a joint. Like we're talking about diving deep into the mind. There's no precedence for that. - Then what do I do? - There's nothing I can do for you here. [bat knocking] If we were to find another location, there's nothing to say that I can't play in my spare time. - I will not hesitate to kill you if you call the police. - Oh, you misunderstand me. I mean, by even practicing this, I could lose my license, go to prison, I'm just as implicated as you are. - Why do it for me? - Well, if we're being transparent I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for me. These are uncharted waters. I want to see where they go. - Good answer. Memorize this. - Got it. - You are to come alone and without a tail, because if you don't I will make you watch as they suffer. And then when you beg for me to kill you, I will do it slowly and painfully. [mumbling] - You're really not helping the stereotype now. It's good to see your levity's not gone. This isn't going to work unless you let me in. You have to give in willingly to the process. You need to want it and I need to be able to put you under without bashing you over the head. - You'd like that, wouldn't you? - Honestly? - No. - I want to try something different. - Are you giving me fucking LSD? Or are you trying some funny shit? Because I must remind you, Doctor, it wouldn't end well for you. Fuck it. - Okay, now let's start on your breathing patterns. I'm going to begin snapping, focus on the tempo. Now focus on the space between the snaps. Breathe in for four snaps and out for four snaps. Now, it'll be fine. Look deeply at this person, recognize who she is. Know what she's done, what she will do. She will try and take you over. She will fight and try to win, try and bring you back to the mundane and pointless existence you had before. 10 years of an unfinished masterpiece, she will erase. She will erase you, erase all that you've built. - But you're far more brilliant than that because you've created me. I'm the white rabbit. You will give me a home in the darkness. I will show you the way back. Trust in me and you will live here forever and reign supreme. Doubt me and the price you pay would be that of your demise. Destruction, your pointless existence wiped away to nothing. - Destroy her, kill her if you must. She is nothing. Do all of it. Follow the white rabbit. Follow the white rabbit. Follow the white rabbit. [fire crackling] [ominous music] [door knocking] - [Bishop] Who is it, what do you want? - Dr. Bishop? Doctor, I know it's late but I could really use your help. - Faster, do this thing faster. - Come on, inside. You can never be too safe. - How do you know me? - [Bishop] I don't, not really. - You were the doctor who checked me into the hospital. - I did, at your directions and those of your psychiatrist. And yes, I induced a medical coma but I can assure you that it was all quite legal. - And you had never met me before? - [Bishop] No. I spoke with both you and Dr. Cameron over the phone. - Dr. Cameron? - [Bishop] Yes, your psychiatrist. I've worked with her before. - Psychiatrist? - Yes, of course. - Why would you induce a medical coma? Why would you need to? - Okay. I think that Dr. Cameron is really the best person to ask that. - I'm asking you, what did you do to me? - Look Cora, it's rather late and it's rather complicated. I'm not sure- - Dr. Bishop, I need your help and I'm not leaving until I have answers. - Okay, I'll tell you what I can. - Thank you. - You know your accident 10 years ago, well the resulting amnesia that followed is not common. From what I understand, you started building new memories and a new life, but your personality was gone. There was too much damage to the amygdala, the cerebellum and the hippocampus. You had a whole new life and a new personality. But something started to change. Your brain seems to be trying to repair itself. Old memories are resurfacing, coming back, to the detriment of the other personality. - What do you mean by detriment? - Well, the neurological phenomena is called [speaker voice muffled] a bubble personality. The disorder is usually temporary and the host's mind often absorbs the temporary personality after a short time, maybe hours after a trauma. 10 years is unheard of. You were coming back, Cora, and whoever you were was disappearing. And as I understand it, this other you soon learned that she was disappearing, dying, I guess you could say, so she started working with Dr. Cameron to ensure a smooth transition to, well, who you are now. And part of that Tran, [banging] part of that transition required putting you back into a coma like resetting at a computer. - Who is she, who is this person? - I'm not sure it really matters as much at this point. - Who was she? - She was someone bad. Someone capable of extraordinary acts of evil. - How do you even know this? How could you even know? - It was made clear to me that my participation was compulsory. - Jesus. - I heard the rumors and I read the papers. I knew who you were. I'm sorry. [dog barking] - I need to use your restroom. - [Bishop] Of course, just down the hall. [soft music] You okay, do you need something? - Yeah, no, I'm okay. - After everything settles down, I can testify. - I'm sorry to interrupt but there's people standing out in front of the house. - What, there's people? - Where, what do you mean? - Shit. They're here. - Who? - These people, you need to call the cops. - Yeah, yeah, of course I'm calling. Okay, no, you need to leave. The cops are looking for you. They think you've killed some of them. It's all over the news. - Let's go, we need to fucking run. - Okay, out the back, hurry. Wait, wait, I've got something that could help. This is your file, it's everything I have. I don't know how much it'll actually help you though. [hatchet chopping] - Come on! - What's your hurry, Cora? Stick around. - Let's go. I know how to find the psychiatrist Dr. Cameron. Her office is on the other side of town. And I know where she lives. That has her address. I just need to prove my innocence. Maybe there's something this Cameron lady can tell me. - She can tell you how fast the doctor can call the cops maybe. At 3:00 AM, I don't think so. If you're Hyde and she's you then there ain't gonna be anyone at her house. Maybe you could drop by and take a look around and wait for morning. Beat the hell out of staying on these streets even a second longer. - I don't know, maybe you're right. - Of course I'm right. - Hey, you should get away from me and this whole situation as soon as possible. It's serious, a man was just murdered in front of us. You should call the police. They're not looking for you. - The police? No, I don't think so. That's not a good idea. Plus, I want to see where this goes, you know, I'm invested now. - We're gonna need a car. - Well, there's one right there. [tense music] [window shattering] - What now? - We need to hot wire the car. Find something to pop up in that panel under the steering wheel. Yes, use that. Remove the ignition wire, that's the green one and the battery wire, no, the red one. Yes, now you're going to need to strip them. That means taking the covering off. - How? - Use the end of the screwdriver. Focus, we need to start the car. - What do I do? - [Girl] Twist them together. [ominous music] [alarm sounding] Now take the ignition wire and spark the blue one. No, the other one. [engine revving] Yes, like that, do it again. - Really? - What did you think it was gonna be? Murderer, gang leader, feared psychopath? She'd be living in a condo, maybe something with a jacuzzi? - No. Shit, really? - If you're trying to hide something or someone do it someplace no one wants to go. - Yeah, well they knocked it out park. Okay, I need to get this over with. - [Hyde] Cora, Cora - What the hell do you want from me now? - I hope you're not talking to the television as no one can hear you. - Fuck off. - Cora, you've made it this far, but it's long past time for you to die, wouldn't you say? And anyway, it shouldn't matter. The body isn't yours to begin with. Not anymore. You haven't earned it. Wasn't like you were using it. When it was yours you gave it up. Tossed it away like so much trash. What a waste. I did more in my time with your body, than you did in your entire life. Imagine if the accident hadn't happened, imagine if you'd still been in control, what would have happened then? You'd be the same person in the same job worrying about the same shit. In my short time, I did amazing things. And then I learned you were coming back, Cora, and that I would be devoured whole. And you wouldn't even know, you wouldn't even remember me and what I've accomplished. Well, you know, I couldn't let that happen. So if you want this body, you'd better be prepared to fight for it. - [Woman] Cora, where are you? [spooky voices muffled] - What are you doing? They're coming in. They're going to kill you. - What do I do, what do I do? - Fight. [whacking] - Look at you, Cora. Nowhere to run, nowhere to run. You really didn't do too bad though. Made it all the way here, played the game the best you could. All by your lonesome. [man screaming] But it was rigged from the beginning. Texas Hold 'Em with a funny card. You weren't meant to win. - Who are you? - Former colleagues, I guess you say. Given a very special mandate from her before she checked out. [tense music] [woman screaming] You know what they say about the pen? - I know who you are. - Do you? - You're her, what's left of her inside my head. - You need me, Cora, you're not done yet. There's more. One more big thing. - Go away. - Cora. - I don't need you! - [Cop] You seem calm considering. - Assured, as in not worried. We'll pick her up. See if we don't. Still plenty of time. There's this episode on Rawhide where Rowdy Yates- - Who? - Clint Eastwood, he played this tough cowhand named Rowdy Yates. - I gotcha. - Ain't that a hell of a name? Anyway, Rowdy Yates goes in to stop this murderer, right? Just grabs him and tosses him backwards and that's all it took. Thing is everyone's walking around in that show packing these big colts, but they almost never use 'em. Just kind of wave them around and pointed them at each other. Always thought that was kind of stupid. Hell, it couldn't have been like that, not back then. I like to think that shooting someone was the last resort, if all else fails and all that. It probably was like that, same as today. There are circumstances, extenuating circumstances. Reasons, good reasons. This is one. [phone ringing] Yeah? Yeah. Okay, we're on our way. [engine revving] When we find her, you know what needs doing, right? You put her down. Don't think, just act. It's better, faster and cleaner for everyone involved. You don't want the dragged in front of a circus. You get a chance to be a hero. Take it. - All right. - Sooner we get this behind us, the better. Better for us, better for our careers. - You've run into Hyde before, haven't you? - Hell, I don't know. Things get complicated down in South Texas. I can't tell you there's a whole lot of people that want to see you walking around. What I can tell you is that her and her folks killed police, alright, that's a one way road. Ain't no coming back from that. - Dr. Cameron's office. - Third floor, 307. [door opening] - We need to have a chat. - Who are you? - Funny question, apparently you know who I am while I've never met you. - It's Cora then. Cora, it's nice to finally meet you. - I have a lot of questions. - I'll answer what I can. - What's happening to me? - Mm, there are two personalities warring inside your head and by all rights you should be the victor, but she- - She's Hyde. - She's playing a game to make sure she doesn't go away, doesn't disappear like a bad memory. - A game, you said, she's playing a game? - Yes, as a result of what you've been subjected to, danger, violence, stress, all of these factors were carefully chosen to create an environment in which she would thrive. Experiences that she would find familiar and would drive her back to the surface. As a result of which, I'm sure you've experienced horrible things, Cora. But these are the things in short that made her Hyde. - In doing this, how did she know it would work? - Hm, well, because I told her. - And why the hell would you do that? - Well, as you probably gathered, she can be quite persuasive. If I'm being completely honest, I was intrigued. No one had experienced anything like this before. This was a once in a opportunity. So yeah, I helped her develop a strategy. - A strategy? Are you fucking kidding me, a strategy? There are people trying to kill me. I've had, I have had to do things, things to protect myself. - Well of course you have, it wouldn't have worked any other way. - Yeah, well, it didn't work because I'm still me. - Are you? Still 100% Cora? I wonder. - What the hell does that mean? - You sure she's not in there? Scraping at the sides, trying to get out. - What the fuck? - See, I think she is. - Go to hell. - Oh wait, do you have a phone? One that you woke up with? Have you been getting messages? - Yeah. - They're all from you, you sent them to yourself. [elevator ringing] [door shutting] [tense music] [phone beeping] - Fuck you! - They're probably already out there waiting for you, Cora. She planned this from the beginning. All you had to do is rely on her and survive. And then soon there would be no Cora left. I guess you'd be the same person, right? - What do I do? - Turn yourself in, of course. - And you would help me? You would testify and tell them that it was not me- - No, no, I'm sorry, no, Cora. I can't expose my own culpability in this. Let's be honest, like if she were to come out again, we'd all be better off if she were quite locked up. Wouldn't you agree? - Please. No, wait, great, I'll turn you in And I'll tell them that you helped her. - Her or you? Come on, Cora, no one's going to believe a word you say. You know, she asked me if it got to this point to tell the police that you're not a threat. I can still do that for you. I mean, it's so far along. There's no sense in you getting killed. Okay, if I'm going to do that I better hurry. Just wait five minutes and then come out with your hands up, okay, so that they know you're not a threat. You're not a threat, are you, Cora? [guns cocking] - Mercy protocols are in place. Building has been evacuated, won't hold out. - Roger that. Who the fuck are these guys? - [Cop] What guys? - Are you an officer? - Yes, ma'am. - I'm on her doctor and I gotta tell you that 'cause she's armed, she's threatening to kill people. - Remember what I told you, take the shot. [tense music] - I'm turning myself in. [gun shooting] - I've got her, bottom floor, east hallway, I'm in pursuit. - Roger that. - I need you. - Of course you do. Not that way. [knife stabbing] We don't have time for this. Take his radio but turn it down. Not that way either. Take the M-four, leave the body, take both the radios, key the mics and tape them facing each other. [ominous music] [suspenseful music] He was wearing a vest, three shots. Aim for his legs. [gun shooting] [man groaning] - What the hell's going on there? [feedback blaring] Now it's time for the rest of them. [film flickering] - God damn it. [man choking] [gun shooting] [laughing] - You shouldn't have done that. You know, you're some kind of fucking monster. How a thing like you can exist is beyond me. If I was born to do one thing in this world it's to put a bullet between your God damn eyes.
