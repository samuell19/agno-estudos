(dramatic music) (upbeat music) - [Angie] The winters in Iowa are hard, but still quite beautiful. I guess the cold is a cover charge for living in an area that has four seasons. The falls are wonderful. Summers are great, and the springtime is the absolute best time in Iowa. I love Iowa in the springtime. ♪ This town ♪ ♪ Walk back down and I'm coming around again ♪ ♪ If I could talk, I'd tell you ♪ ♪ If I could smile, I'd let you know ♪ - [Clint] I am a 23-year-old college graduate. I work in an office. I like it enough, I guess. I hope they keep me here, then I can work my way up. I wanna be a successful businessman one day. Like a family. Like, uh, in the old sitcoms. I have trouble closing a sale, though. I am trying, and it'll get better. (upbeat music) I grew up here in Cedar Falls, Iowa. I was raised mostly by this woman. She went to the same church as my parents. I was also watched out for by my uncle. People call him The Boss. My parents were tragically killed, but arrangements were made for the saintly woman to take care of me in the event that anything happened. And it did. I was too young to remember, but from what I have heard, they were the best. My uncle tells me all the time how great my mother and father were and how much everyone misses them. They thought my uncle wouldn't have been the best influence on me growing up. He owns an adult book store and strip club in town. Not the best environment to be brought up in. He helps watch over me and make sure that the sweet old church lady has everything needed to raise a good Christian gentleman, as he puts it. (upbeat music) - [Angie] I am 23 years old. I never knew my parents, I was in foster care most of my life, until I ended up here in Waterloo, Iowa, living with a distant cousin that I found I know very little about my family. This is it. A cousin. She is very Christian, and goes to church twice a week, and Bible study every Friday morning. She took me in and is a wonderful woman, a selfless woman, who is always thinking of others. I graduated college, but I work here. (upbeat music) This is my boss. His name is Jorge. - Ah, Dude, what the fuck? - [Angie] People call him Jorge, the Pissed Off Pizza Cook. (bell dings) - You know what? I noticed you don't have any White Zin on the menu. Come on, honey. Let's get with the program. - We don't have any fucking White Zin. Why are you asking? You sideways wannabe fuck. And chewing gum while asking about the pH. pH my sorted nuts, puto. Stupid fuck. - [Angie] But deep down, he is a big teddy bear. Just very passionate about the art of Neapolitan pizza. - Hey, Angie, what can I get for you, sweetie? - [Angie] My passion is music. I have written a few songs, but still haven't been able to perform one yet. I have stage fright. Maybe someday I'll be able to do it. (upbeat music) I love this bridge. I always come here when I'm a little down, and it always makes me feel better. I flip pennies off of it into the Cedar River below, make little prayers and wishes. I told someone once that I did this, and they said it was stupid. No wish has ever come true on the Fourth Street Bridge in Waterloo. Well, that just means it's due for some. ♪ The most imaginary friend ♪ - [Clint] I come to this bridge sometimes. I, I don't know why. It makes me happy. Every time I come here, I feel better about things. I know no one should ever go to a bridge when they're depressed, but I like this place for some reason. ♪ Imaginary friend ♪ - [Angie] I've been dating, but it's hard. Still a virgin. I wanna fall in love before I would ever decide to do that. (mellow music) - [Clint] I'm still a virgin, and it sucks. I would like to fall in love before I lose it, you know, like the way it really should be. But a 23 year old male virgin while my uncle owns a strip club? That's just pathetic. - [Angie] I get plenty of advice from church people. - I just been through my second round of conversion therapy. I knew it work this time. I didn't even come close to a truck stop bathroom in months. - I had just been through my third stint of rehab, and I never wanted a drop of bourbon again. I was through with that. - We were at the ice cream social at the Fellowship Hall, and I was part of the variety show, and that's where we fell in love. - Yes, he did the Mary Magdalene song from Jesus Christ Superstar. What was that song called again, honey? - "I Don't know How To Love Him." - [Angie] Church people. - I fell in love youth pastor. I married right away. Six months later, I had a baby. All at the age of 17. - What about that Stewart boy? He's a nice man. - Well, he's 45. Been divorced twice, but he's had some bad luck. - Well, that's what you get for marrying a Methodist. - Better find yourself a fella before it's too late. - She's right. Once that first cat gets in your house, it can go downhill fast. - Right. You don't wanna end up like Blanche. - That was the worst potato salad I ever had at a funeral. - [Both] Sad. - [Angie] And more church people. - I met my wife at a church function and I asked her God-fearing wonderful Lutheran parents for permission to begin a courtship. Now we fell in love and promptly were married, and seven months later she gave birth to our daughter, and just like that, we are a Christian family. Later that year, she graduated high school, and began the life that God had planned for her as a loving wife and mother. And it all happened when we made the decision to go to that same church social on a Wednesday night all those years ago. For all the singles in our congregation, we're having an ice cream social this coming Wednesday in the Fellowship Hall. - [Clint] I have had all types of advice on this from all types of people. Teachers. - Basically, I don't believe in love. It's trivial. I've had several men fall in love with me, and it usually ends as quickly as it began. Their wives find out. - [Clint] College professors. - Love is divine. Quite literally, a divination of the God above parlayed upon his specimen here on Earth. - Remus? I do respect you as a man, as a man of intelligence, but I must respectfully disagree. (groans) For I must caution the viewers against love, as it is nothing but lust in disguise. (groans) For our Neanderthal brain all the way up to the singularity, it is nothing but a trick to get us to co-mingle and procreate. - Pemus, if love were simply to propagate the species by way of procreation, why then does it feel so good when my wife pegs my butthole? - Remus, the same reason why it feels so good for a grown woman to squeeze my face between her thick thighs. Because we're fetish freaks. - [Director] All right, cut! Take five, everybody, take five. - Man, I thought we'd be out of here by now. - I know. Well, it takes forever. These guys don't know what the hell they're talking about. - Right? - Yeah. - It's like they're two professors talking about how you can learn about love from some book. Like that's the answer to, if that was real-- - Yeah. - I think we would all be perfectly happy right now. - Exactly. - It doesn't make any sense. - You can't define love. - Right, that's what I try to tell everyone. - It's an experience. Like, you can't just quantify love with a manual. - Exactly. - It's not, it's poetry. It's not linear, it's, it's experiences. It's people, it's connecting on some intimate level you just can't write about, you can't read about it. You have to feel it. - We should be doing what they're doing. - I know. (laughing) - I mean-- - Well, you should. - What? - Nothing. (mellow music) - Do you maybe, are you, are you free this weekend? It just sounds like we have a lot of the same thoughts on stuff. It would be nice to talk to someone. - You know what, yeah, I am. I am free. Yeah, that sounds good. - Cool. (mellow music) - [Director] Look alive, people. Five, four, three. Ready and action. - Shall we name them off? Jimmies, rubbers, raincoats, sheepskin, you can use almost anything. - So long as you don't stick your willy in the laminator at your middle school on lunch break, you can have safe sex without ruining your cock. - Like we did. - [Clint] And drunks. - All you have to do is meet a girl at the bar. I don't discriminate: white, fat, Asian. - Asian, yeah, (chuckles) Asian. - I'll fuck a Pokémon if she look good. - Damn right. Look, you meet someone at the bar, take them home, all you have to do is have sex. - Tear it up. No man. - You right man. - That's all. - Have some sex, have some kids. Get pinned on child support. - Hey. Extended-stay hotels the rest of your life, dude. - What Joe Rogan said. (mellow music) - [Angie] I have never been in love. So I really don't know what it would be like. People just always say you'll know. It's like that song by Skott Green. He's a musician from here. He's in a band, Dead Writer. He has a song that is called Love Struck Sick. Love that song, but there's just something missing. - [Clint] I don't know what it means to be in love. I've never been in love. From what I've been told, I'll know when it happens. I wanna fall in love at first sight. It just seems like the easiest way. Right away. The least amount of work like winning the lottery. - [Angie] Tonight, I am at the Catacombs Lounge below Galleria de Paco in Waterloo, Iowa waiting for my date. - [Clint] Tonight, I'm at the Galleria de Paco in Waterloo, Iowa waiting for my date. - [Both] Who knows, this could be the one. (mellow music) - [Angie] Did he say a different night? He is an older guy. He's probably got a lot going on. Is this the right place? - [Clint] She is an older woman. Maybe she's running late. She did say Galleria de Paco, right? - [Angie] He seemed nice when he asked me out. He's not coming. I've been stood up. This hurts. - [Clint] (groans) Christian Mingle sucks. Brock said something about Grindr? I don't know about that. That's it. I'm officially stood up. I'm gonna go drink, and then get the Uber Jew to drive me home.

In fact, get this gentleman a 15-year-old Glenfiddich on the rocks, and I'll have another as well. - [Bartender] All right, you got it, Vincent. - Thank you, Vincent, is it? - Vincent, yes indeed. - Very nice to meet you. Are you by chance The Don? - Yes, some people do call me The Don. You know, I don't mind that nickname that much. When I was a youngster about your age, there was a banker in my hometown that bought me my first glass of Scotch. Thank you. - Where are you from? - Oelwein. Oelwein, Iowa. The banker's name was Don Bennachie. He owned and operated the Maynard Savings Bank. It was in Hazleton, a little ways away from Oelwein. He was a consummate gentleman. He was the only one that would extend a mortgage to my mom and dad on our home. But (sighs) the summer between my junior and senior year, my father suffered from a sudden heart attack. And I was real mixed up. I had been crying for about three weeks, you know. And I was so confused, I didn't know what to do. And I finally decided the only thing I'm gonna be able to do is to quit college. I'm gonna have to quit college, I'm gonna have to get a job, and I'm gonna have to help my mom out any way that I possibly can. And then the door to the Paddock Lounge opens, and all that mid-afternoon Iowa sunshine pours through and in walks Don Bennachie. Oh, and he was a sharp looking guy. Had a blue suit, you know, cuff links, wingtip shoes, monogrammed shirt collars, and twin cloth handkerchiefs, monogrammed DWB, Donald William Bennachie. - Wow. - See, he'd heard from my mom that I was planning on quitting school. So, he comes up to the bar, and he scoots a stool up, and the bartender gives him a Cutty Sark on the rocks. So, he orders a second glass of Cutty, and he puts it in front of me, and he says, "Here you go, this is Scotch. "This is a gentleman's drink." He says, "I wanna talk to you about school." He says, "Your father is a very intelligent man, "and he made sure that he had certain things in place. "He understood the importance of life insurance. "So, he made sure that if anything happened to him, "that you and your mother would be taken care of." And he told me what a great guy my father was, how much that he would miss him, and he told me that everything would be okay. So, I... I finished college. And that's where I got my nickname. You know, I was this Italian kid from Oelwein, Iowa, and all of my dorm mates, they'd seen way too many of those mafia movies, so they called me The Don as a joke. But you know, I didn't... I didn't mind it that much. 'Cause every time I heard it, it reminded me of our family friend, you know. Then when I graduated, Don handed me a plain card, you know, cash inside, but he'd written only one line: "Your father would be so proud. "DWB." (mellow music) So, keep your head up, Clint.

He lived in a loft above Gong Food He, but they went out of business recently, and a Starbucks took over that location. Also, an Applebee's opened across the street. Harold promptly moved back to Waterloo. He now lives in a post-World War II bungalow, original kitchen in pristine condition. Harold is content. - Come on, man, McCarthy? - Always. - He was crossing boundaries on this, social economics, man. John Hughes, he was, you know, getting the punks and the elitists together to go ahead and realize they didn't have too much apart from each other. What did Mannequin ever do? - Inspire me.

She is a political analyst. - I went on a date with an agnostic from Missouri last night. Literal perfection. I mean, a guy from the Show Me State that believes, that believes, there is a God if you show him. - [Clint] This is the Beer Hall, on the corner of Falls Avenue and Ansborough, in Waterloo, Iowa, within the Falls Avenue Mall, right next to the famous Rudy's Tacos. - Oh, what a day, what a day. Throw two coaches out, couple fans come at me at half-time, two technicals on the players. We got somebody keeping score that's never been to a basketball game before. Junior high girl's basketball has become a bloodsport. (laughing) - What do you got today? - I got, I gotta get off to my next, my next set of games. - What do you got? - I got volleyball tonight. - Is that hard? - Oh, it's really hard. You can't get caught looking at the girls' asses in them tight shorts. You occasionally gotta get a line call right, and then they expect me to stay sober enough to climb up on that damn pole. (laughing) I'm outta here. - Good luck, Glenn. - Good luck, Glenn. - So, I started Fighter Body this week. Shit's fucking intense, man. I've done like 150 squats, like 75 burpees. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, burpees? What the hell is a burpee? - A burpee is a full on pushup all the way down to the ground, stand up, jump, and then back down. - Sounds like too much work for me. - So, you trying to fit into a bridesmaid dress, or what? - Hope it's not that ugly, strapless, form shit. Man, that shit is ugly. - (laughs) Yeah, no kidding. - No, I'm just turning 30, and I wanna look good. - I'll be honest, you already look good. I'll fuck you right now. - Yeah, yeah, you're right. - Evening gentlemen. - Hey, look at the hair. Oh God, that looks great. - [Clint] This is my uncle, The Boss. Most uncles sell cars, work in a bank, or manage a restaurant somewhere. Mine though? Smut merchant. - Hair looking good, finally. - [Cling] This is Brock. Or as he likes to refer to himself as - Brock the Cock. - I refuse to address him as this. He's an alpha male. The type of guy who slaps his date on the butt, and tells bartenders they need to smile more. But he's gay. So, he gets away with it all. Toxic masculinity complex is acceptable for a homosexual. He's like a UN ambassador with diplomatic immunity. American gay men are a protected species now, like bald eagles. It goes bald eagle, snow owl, North American homosexual. Thank you, thank you. Hey, can I get a Scotch? - Whoa! Scotch? - Drinking like a man and a new haircut? Did you go to the barber and tell him, "Hey, "I wanna quit looking like an asshole?" - Well, you know what, both of these changes came from one very influential man. - [Brock] I'd like to think it was me. - You know, actually, he was joking on your hair earlier about the, what was that, the-- - Well, you know, seriously. - The 80s movie with the-- - Okay, seriously, I wanted to say that you look like Rocky Dennis with the hair, where you're like, "Things that I like." - Oh, come on. - Yeah. - "The sun on my face." - You gotta be kidding me. - "Things that I don't like, the snap of a camera, "the horrified sounds of a crowd." - What was that, was it Mask? - It was the Mask, yeah. - Cher was in that. Who was the, who was the guy? He just was up for the Oscar. Was it Sam Elliot? - Sam Elliot. - Yeah. - Yeah, it was Sam Elliot. - Yeah. We're gonna go to Europe, man. (laughing) Yeah, he was, he was doing the-- - You can go anywhere you want, baby. - God that was sad at the end. But yeah, he was joking on your hair. - Nah, fuck that man. It was the end of fucking Frankenstein that they should have had, the freak died. - Mom says I look like a lion. - Well, she was lying. You look like a fucking monster. - What, you're drinking Scotch now? This is awesome. - Yeah. - This is great. You got a haircut, you're drinking Scotch. I'm proud of you. This is good. - You know what, I was at Galleria de Paco-- - Oh God it's great, isn't it? - Yeah, yeah, for the most part, but I got stood up there. - Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Yeah, yeah. I know that sucks, it sucks. There's nothing worse because I sit there, and I waste my time. - I've never had a bad date there. - That's a good place to eat. - I went downstairs, and I ran into The Don, actually. - Ooh. Really? - Good man. - Yeah. - You made friends with The Don. - Yeah. He's the one who advised the haircut and introduced me to this fine-- - So being stood up was the best thing that could have happened to you if you made friends with The Don. Those are the people you need to know in this time. I'm proud of you. That's great. That's a great man. - Yeah. - Good work. So, what happened with the date? - She just, I don't know. - No call, no show? - Yeah. (sighs) I didn't hear anything from her. She was an older lady. I don't know what was going on. - Cougar? - Yeah, I, I don't know if I should ask about that, but-- - Yeah, never really ask that. - Yeah. - Seriously. - Brock, do you really, I mean, well-- - And if she's too old, dude, let's be honest. That's a fucking saber tooth tiger. That's prehistoric pussy, don't go for that. - Do the gays have that? Do have, like, cougars, or what do they do with the gays. - Yeah, there's some people that are like, one of the old gays, you know, and then, I usually say to them, uh, they're like, "I'm 61 years old." I'm like, Jesus Christ, I didn't even know they made gay people back then. (laughing) - You go on a lot of dates. What is, yeah, I mean, what is going on with that? I mean, what-- - I'm 23 years old, right. I, I feel like it's about time I find my special someone. Let me ask you guys. Have either of you ever been in love? - I think I was once, I don't really know. - Yeah. Yeah, I was once. - You were in love? - Yeah. - Wanna tell us about it? - The best five minutes of my life. (groaning) Oh God! - Eww. I don't know, don't be so hard on yourself, man. Like I guess, you know when you know, like when that musician in town, that, that, that brilliant musician, the guy that's in that band Dead Writer? - Skott Green. - Yeah, yeah, he has got that song, what is it? "Lovesick Struck"? Or-- - "Love Struck Sick." - "Love Struck Sick." - Yeah, he pretty much lays it out. - Captures the imagination of the whole town. Mine is the glory hole experience for me personally but, he does nail it. - Okay the glory hole is referring to, I can't confirm nor deny that it exists in one of my establishments-- - Yeah but that's sort of sense of being mysterious adds enough sexual ambience to it, you know? - He spends so much money down at that place, I can't confirm or deny that those exist-- - Look man, I can't be banging people at my house anymore, then they know where I live. - I can't confirm or deny that this happens at one of my establishments. - Well, what's the legality of having one of those in an establishment? - I can't confirm or deny that this happens at one of my establishments. - The legality? Let's just talk about how hot it is. - Hey, will you do it? - Do what? - Come on. Do the R Kelly. - Yes, yes, do it. R Kelly man. - Sometimes you guys be racist, man. (all laughing) - Come on. - Come on. - Do it. - They just want me to be a monster, man! I didn't do it man! All you have to do is go to Instagram and post a picture of R Kelly stealing a puppy and everybody gonna say, R Kelly is a monster. I don't have the money to pay the child support. - I love it, man, I love it! - I'm 14, will you pee on me? (laughing) - Well boys, I'm off to another dick daggle, so they say. - I would shake your hand but-- - [Brock] I wouldn't. - Have a good night Brock. - See ya Brock. I like that guy. - What a character, my God. So you met The Don, huh? - Yeah, speaking of characters, he's something else, man. He's something else. - Did he tell you any stories? - Yeah, actually. - Which one did he tell ya, which one did he tell ya? - He hit me with the Don Bennachie one. - Yeah, that's a good one. He's told me that one before. You know I knew Don Bennachie. Met him a few times. God damn. It's exactly what he needed to hear. He tell you the part about where he got the card from Don Bennachie at his graduation? And said his father would be proud. - Yeah. - Probably changed his life, you know, hearing that. Now we have him here. God, you know, everyone good son deserves to hear that their father is proud, at least once. He never got to hear from his dad actually, you know? My father told me he was proud of me once, that was the greatest day of my life. I can remember everything about it. Obviously it was way before I owned these businesses. I can remember what the wallpaper looked like in that restaurant, I can remember what the coffee tasted like, and my father, he told me, he was proud of me, that was the greatest moment of my life. That, that... God dammit buddy, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - It's all right, it's all right. - Every good son deserves to hear at least once that their father is proud. - [Clint] When dating, you will go out with-- - [Angie] All sorts of characters. - [Both] Like: - [Angie] Swipe Right Guy. The type that throw out a big net for any and all women on Tinder. - You have really nice hands, do you moisturize? I've got a really nice basement, you should come over. I think you'd really like it. - [Clint] Non-binary girls or people or, I don't know, I know I'm wrong but either way I lose. - That's my dog Winston. - Aw, looks like such a good boy. - Wait, did you just assume my dog's gender? You're a typical agent of the patriarch society. Brainwashed and programmed to carry out misogyny. How dare you not allow my child Winston to choose their gender, what kind of monster are you? - [Angie] Cul-De-Sac Hip-Hop Guy. The guy who is white and lives in a good neighborhood but talks like a gangster rapper. - Yo, shorty. 45 is gonna be a prime year for your boy. My album's gonna drop, I'm gonna move out of my mom's basement. I'll be buying you Red Lobster every Sunday. Cheddar Bay biscuits baby girl. You know I like my girls a little bit thicker but ya ight. - [Clint] Cell Phone Girls. Just girls, who go on their cellphones, a lot. So, what do you do? - I'm a Instagram influencer. - [Clint] Cool, cool, how many followers do you have? - A couple, few thousand, I don't know. - That's cool. Do you, what are you uh, take pictures of? - [Cell Phone Girl] Myself. - Nice. - Like this. Do you like it? - That's really good, yeah I like. So, what do you think about the moon landing? That shit didn't happen, right? Yeah? - Oh my God, my friend went to Disney World. - Yeah, (sighs) you're right, Stanley Kubrick did direct it. How 'bout 9/11? 9/11, right? Jews did it. Bush was behind it all, right, yeah? How did building 7 fall down? Wasn't hit by a plane. You think a plane could melt steel beams, you know? Jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams-- - Look at what you would look like if you had a beard and a hat. - (sighs) How about the pyramids, you know? There's no way that the Egyptians could have built the pyramids with the technology they had at the time. - [Angie] Guy Who Don't Know They Are Gay Yet. - Everybody says that I remind them of Edward from Twilight and I can see that you also think that I'm like Edward from Twilight. I understand. I'm not Robert Pattinson. I wish that I was, with his big strong arms, just like wrapping you up, making you feel all warm and safe and cozy inside. So, like, my name's Tyler but my friend Tyler, you may have met him, he's like kinda handsome, you know, strapping, like, broad shoulders, you know. Really, really handsome. I don't think you understand it, he is very handsome. No? Okay, that's fine, anyway, so he turned me on to this idea called pegging? Do you know what that is? It's where, like a guy, so get this, this is wild and you know, I'm not like super into this sort of thing but I'll try anything once, I always say that, I think that's the motto of the Boy Scouts. And that's where I learned it. - [Clint] Narcissistic Mean Women. Brock has another word for them, it's shorter and to the point. - Cunts. - I never come to Waterloo, I always go to the Ceder Falls Brown Bottle and if you're lucky enough to get a second date with me, we can only come here when it's light outside. I haven't been around this many minorities since my last DUI. I think I went to high school with that loser. Quit staring at me you soy boy beta cuck. (mellow music) - [Clint] There are only a few places to go on a first date in the Ceder Valley. The Brown Bottle. The Waterloo one, the Ceder Falls one is flooded this time of year. - I'm just gonna get a little comfier, are you okay with that? Are you into feet? I think you should smell this. I sprayed it with some Febreze. Mm, you like that? Warms me up. How's your breath? When I like to get eaten out, I like a mint. Thank you. You know, I'm into some pretty fun things. Like, now then, bus driver, Mississippi diver. You not heard of those? One of my favorites is the Milwaukee blizzard. Oh, sweetie, you don't need to freak out, momma will take good care of you. - Hi there. - Hi. - Thanks for joining me. So, tell me a little bit about yourself. (elevator music) - Well, I'm just working right now. - Okay, where at? - [Angie] I'm a waitress. - Oh, cool, awesome. Low self-esteem and stuff then, that's awesome. Where do you work, where do you waitress at? - [Angie] Um-- - That's cool, that's awesome. What's the hardest part about it? - [Angie] Well, I mean, you're walking, running around-- - Oh, yeah, definitely, I can see that. I can see that. Do you want something to drink? Can you drink? - Um-- - Fruit smoothie? Shirley Temp? I like a Shirley Temp from time to time, I do a Dirty Shirley. I can get you a drink here probably, if you want. Be gnarly. - Um, I'm fine, I'll just-- - If you like, it can be a B&J wine cooler, maybe? Something? Have you ever had vatorade? Vodka Gatorade? Sipping that, you know, in geometry class or something (chuckles). Maybe? No? - I'm not sure. - What do they drink on Laguna Beach? Or what are you kids watching these days? Real World. - Okay so I have a question, serious question. I've never had sex with an uncircumcised male. Are you circumcised or not? I'd really like to feel it. I have a friend, she says her husband is not circumcised, she said because of that extra skin, it gives it that extra mmph of a sexy feeling. So, what do you have? Oh, also, size-wise? I can't go too big because, you know, I like the thickness of a dick. How's your ball smacking ability? Do you like to turn it around? Or, I can be on top the whole time. That is absolutely not a problem, I do a lot of ab workouts. Lots of workouts. I'll take care of you. - So, I'm thinking about maybe going back to my place tonight and painting or something? From the looks of things, I don't know what your hobbies are, it just looks like maybe, painting? Singing? Dancing? Artsy something. - Art, yeah. - Yeah, totally, yeah, I feel that, I feel that. - Okay. - So, maybe we just grab some wine after this? What do you think? - I don't care, I'm probably just gonna... Go. - Yeah, go? Let's go then. We'll just get out of here. - Not right now. - You can come back to my place. No, not right now? We'll wait, we'll get food first. Good food here, you know, you can order whatever you want. Just try to keep it under, like, 45. If you can. (chuckles) or if you can't, either way. Yeah, I made an app, have you been on, have you seen it? It's a Bible study app. You can meet up, get on your knees and pray, you know what I mean? Just the good Lord's name, coming right out of your mouth, just oh God, oh God, oh Lord, yes Lord, hard Lord, you know what I mean? - You're not allergic to cats are you? I kinda have a cat thing. That is a fetish. Have you not heard of the meowing fetish? Meow. I like having people pet me, mm. - Hi there, yes, ill have the cesar salad and I think the lady will have the meatball sub, don't cut it, big, two, full double-hander, big hefty balls please with that. And finish it off, banana split, don't actually split the banana and again, I want a hearty, healthy banana. I'll be back and I'll check the kitchen if you're not. If there's any way to, you guys make a corn dog? No, no corn dogs available. Let's see. I need a drink, definitely a drink, long drink, straw. Big straw (slurps). You know what I'm talking about? Anything else, are you? Not the shrimp cocktail, no, don't bring that up. - I'm also into a lot of bondage. I can be submissive, or dominant. Whatever works for you, I mean if you like to go both ways, I can just smack you real quick and you're fine. You can do it back to me! I like it. Oh, thank you. (exhales) - Have you been with a man before? - What do you mean? - Like been with a man, in the Biblical sense, you know what I mean. - [Angie] No. - Have you, um, taken his offering? Has anyone broken the sound barrier? If you know what I mean. That hymen. No? That's cool. - So, I'm just gonna pay for these drinks. I'll give you some time to get your shit together 'cause you seem a little emotional and you can come and meet me in the restroom in about 10 minutes and then you can come and give me some good dick. Sound good? Perfect, thank you. - Before dinner and everything gets here, I'll make a little space and I might you know, clear the pipes a little bit, for later tonight, you know what I mean. And probably gonna see if they have any condoms for sale in the bathroom. I'm a gentleman, I'll buy one. Probably won't wear it but I will purchase it, just so that you know that the respect level is there. Order a drink, order some food, maybe, whatever you want. Heard they've got good muscles so order that up, if you like a (slurping). Slurp something down. So, I will be right back, madam. ♪ Gettin' my dick sucked ♪ - [Clint] Okay, I am now officially freaked out. - [Angie] Okay, I am now officially freaked out. (Spanish guitar music) - And so yeah, that was like the fifth yeast infection in like, as many months. - Well, I don't know what kind of water you're drinking, you've got a Brita filter in your house, or what's going on, maybe change the laundry detergent. I don't know enough about yeast. Stop eating fucking bread! Maybe, that might be the move. - I've just been drinking out of the back section of the toilet. - Oh, you were getting the yeast infections. - Yes, I was getting them. - Sorry, I was half listening. - And then I was then giving them to other people. It was, I mean it was probably my second best summer that I've ever had. - That's cool man. Yeah, you're like the Gingerbread Man but with giving out yeast kind of a thing. - Yeah, I mean that's-- - That's dope. - That's actually what I use as my internet handle. - Can I catch that? We've shared, like, drinks and stuff. Can I catch that, that way? - I think alcohol is the great purifier so we're all good. - Oh, it kills it. Good, good, good, good, man. - Hey man, so, how'd that go? By the way. - I mean, she's a virgin, or is, not for long, hopefully but we'll see, she'll pick up on it later. She'll probably get some bad dick from someone else and then she'll call me up and she can get some bad dick from me. - And then afterwards, then I will hit her up on LinkedIn and I will say, hey girl, I heard you had one Tyler, would you like another one? - You almost might wanna try our app. - Well see, that's the thing, I am so happy with how things have been going with this app. - Who knew. - Yeah. Who knew Christians were super horny, man. - You start a Bible app, hey, let's meet up, let's study Bible, all they wanna do, finger each other. Big time. - Yeah man. ("Just Like Heaven") - So, guess who I saw yesterday? - Joe Biden. - You're close, Tyler the Tool. - (chuckles) I am close. - Where'd you see Tyler the Tool? - He was at the grocery store and he tried hitting on me by the produce section. - He hangs out by the produce? - Yeah, man, think of all the phallic shaped vegetables. (laughing) - You know he took a hooker to prom. - Took a hooker to prom. - Yeah, he took a hooker to prom. - He took a hooker to prom. ("Just Like Heaven") - You went on a date with Tyler the Tool? - Yeah. - You know he took a hooker to prom, right? - What, how does that work? - Oh, well, you find one, you pay them and then you go to prom. - Did people know it? - Imagine going to prom and your science teacher slips your date a hundred. - Okay, where do we even find a hooker? - Well, it's not like the movies, not Pretty Woman, no Richard Gere. - Gerbil. - Okay, how do you start a career in prostitution? - Well, it starts when you answer an online advertisement for a potential modeling gig. - If things don't pick up for you waitressing, maybe you should think about a career in prostitution. - You know, I'd manage you, I'd be your pimp. I'd sell you to those rich oil Sheikhs. - Mmhmm. - I would totally trust you as my pimp. - End of the day, it's the same for any woman. Your feet hurt and you are unraveling dirty cash that has been given to you by guilty Lutherans. - Now go make that scratch, bitch. (all laughing) - You went on a date with Kinky Karla? - I've never been through something so traumatic. And my parents are dead. (Brock laughs) - You know, she used to work for me. - Oh, yeah. Oh my God. - She was good, she was very good. We sold a lot of anal beads when she was employed. - My God, I remember that summer, man. Seriously, I used to always refer to the vagina as the wage gap, until I saw what receipt she was pulling on, look at all the commission she made, it was more money than I could fathom. - It's a huge markup on anal beads. And it's an item you don't really re-use. You usually buy them new again. - Well, yeah, especially the way I'm using them. Most people try to pull them out all slow and seductive. Not me, man, get it over with. Just one quick pull, like a band-aid. Or starting a lawnmower on the first day of spring. Just a final crank back. - You know, you void your warrantee when you do that. - Oh, fuck the warranty, they're made in China. - Yeah, why are they made in China? Why can't we make those here? I mean it's a simple plastic product. - After NAFTA, everything went over there and Mexico. - I know, it's horrible because it's kind of a cheap product, why aren't we making that here? I mean there's gotta be manufacturing space over in Cedar Falls at the Cedar Falls Park, Technology Park. You can get a place over there making anal beads. Why can't we manufacture those here? - The problem is, is that they hold the quality standards too high over here. Over there, you can have air bubbles in those things, man. They can come out like a pair of pliers from Harbor Freight. You push on them, they'll crank down and break on the first try. - I would be happy to pay a higher wholesale on anal beads if they were made in America. I'd be happy to. - That's the problem, nobody wants to make like an old Chevy, back in the '50s. - I know, we just lost our quality standards and you know, we're so willing to pay for a cheap product that's inferior, made in China when it could be made here. - I thought I was gonna fall in love tonight.

So, do you go to church? - Yeah, I go to First United Methodist in Cedar Falls. - Oh, that's cute and quaint. I'm a Lutheran, so. It's, it's okay. (chill music) (elevator music) (burps) - Oh, hey. Yeah. Books. Power. Got a hawk on it. That's pretty dope. My favorite. Put that down for later. - So, where do you work? - I work at sales. - Oh, well, I see you're not wearing a tie with your blazer so I'm gonna say you're more of a renter rather than owner. Usually, personally, I go for owners but we're here so um. So, what do your parents do? - My parents, they died when I was really young. - Oh, so you're like lower middle class then. And no trust fund, I'm assuming. That's okay, mine have got me pretty well set-up. So, my dad's in accounting so that's Wartburg, obviously. But you look nice. - Oh, right, food! Oh okay, I gotta have one of your famous meatball subs, I'm talking like, the 12 inch with the meatballs and the sauce, I gotta have me some shredded chee' in there. And then you gotta have me some jalapeños and uh, what's on your meatball sub? Cheesecake. Cheesecake. Guy. Cheesecake. - Well, this has been an interesting experience, to say the least but I'm a little more New York Times, where you're Oelwein Daily Register. - The Don's from Oelwein, so I'll take it. Well, they're not mething around with Oelwein, are they? - Oh my God, you went on a date with Becky Harrington? - She prefers Rebecca now. - Why wouldn't she? - Rebecca? What is she a Jewish girl from Schaumburg, Illinois trying to get into North Western? - Well, what happened on that date? - She was just so mean. Like, had no soul, just ruthless. I told her about my parents and she followed it up with, "Oh, so no trust fund?" - Oh my God. - I know her parents pretty well. The mother is mean as hell too. - That fucking bitch. Deserves to get Ted Bundy'd but without the fucking charm. - I see her father down at the cabaret once in a while. Typical Cedar Falls WASP that tries to come in all incognito. - Yeah but that's the kind of cuck she deserves. - I know. A man that old should never be wearing Curve cologne that he bought at Sam's Club half off. (Brock chuckles) - You know Skott, I have something I've been meaning to ask you. Do you think, some of the best rock and roll artists of our time, if you wanna talk about Mick Jagger or Robert Plant or maybe Tom Waits perhaps. Do you think any of them ever chose to vape? - I would guess that they do in their free time. Behind the cameras. - You think so? - Oh sure. ♪ Hoping for the best but expecting the worst ♪ ♪ Are you gonna drop the bomb or not ♪ - So, our coven usually meets on Wednesdays, hump day. We usually let out before happy hour and we usually have wine. - You ready for the night? - To be ready for more rituals and whatever else might pop up. - So, what does that involve, more rituals? - Well, we like to do our rituals out amongst nature and in the woods and we usually like to perform them skyclad. - I love going skyclad. - You got any more room for members? - Well, our brood currently has about 10 witches but we would have room for two warlocks. - You know, I'm keen to whip out the wand and blow out some magic. Expel some fairy dust. - So, what's up witches? You ready to party? - You went out with Burnout Brad? - Yeah. Someone at church set us up. Said he was a little gentleman. - Oh, come on, that guy is a total waste. He's stoned all the time. - Yeah. Does he work? - Yeah but he's an orderly. - What? - What's an orderly? - It's a hospital attendant. Responsible for the non-medical care of patients. - [Angie] Okay, how did he get that job? - How does anyone get a job? Good point though. Who are the other applicants passed over for Burnout Brad? - Wouldn't they drug test? - Oh, they do but stoners are geniuses at working their way around a drug test. - Tell me you did not go for a ride in his car. - No, no, I took an Uber. - Okay. - Who'd ya get? - Uber Jew. - Uber Jew, he is the best Uber driver. - God, isn't it great? He is very Jewish, you know, Uber Jewish and drives an Uber, he is the Uber Jew. - Yup. - Classic. You wouldn't believe how many people don't get that joke. - Michelle Pfeiffer, "Grease 2", yeah. That's the one with the guy from England who plays Sandy's cousin, yeah. - The very same. Michelle Pfeiffer in her greatest role, she needed hell on wheels and Michael, man, he burned hot, he was a cool, cool rider. - Yeah, he came to America his senior year, lived with his uncle, did term papers for cash in his uncle's nuclear fallout shelter to buy parts to build a motorcycle to win the heart of Michelle Pfeiffer. - The American dream. - Truly is an American musical. Rugged individualism. Like "Rocky" or "High Noon." - It is exactly like "Rocky", Henry. The greatest musical of all time. I'm so glad you've come around. Harold is pleased. - Yeah.

At Bronshay Records. - Yeah, with Michelle Pfeiffer in the pink coat and that guy from England, right on the cover. - The very same, "Grease 2" vinyl, LP. You've impressed me today, Henry. I have no choice but to take your word. - I remember the motorcycle with the number two on the flag. - That is the one. There's no way it would be another one. Pardon me, Henry, you must excuse me.
