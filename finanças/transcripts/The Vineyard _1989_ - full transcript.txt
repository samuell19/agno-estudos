- Damn wild dogs. Ooh. Feeling warm, huh? Let's see what you got on. Yeah. I want you, too. Yeah, burn baby, burn. - All for you. - Let's go inside. - Okay. - Elson, what are you doing to me? - Acupressure. - Are you sure? - What does it feel like? - I don't know, but whatever it is, it's incredible. - You're so good to me. - Of course I am. - You think of the weirdest thing, Gina. - Turn around, darling. There's something I want to show you. - What is it? - God, not again. Another one of those nightmares? - Hurry! Selagod, King of Mayan Gods, yes. Grant me eternal life. Yes, give it to me. Give it to me! Thank you. Thank you for longevity. Forgive me for what I've done in order to survive. Lord Selagod. God of winds. You have given me strength and power. Embrace me as I go out and execute your work. Yes, all those. All those who drink your wine will be your disciples soon. Lord, I'm in constant fear of failing you before I complete my work for you. This, this amulet, it's growing smaller and smaller as the passing days go on. You must show me another source of life, a more lasting source, lord. Show me a sign. Show me a way, lord. - Damn it, Willis, we are late. - Now we won't even get one bottle of Dr. Po's wine. - You there, excuse me, boy. Which entrance is for the wine auction? - Down there. - Come along, darling. - Lucas. Stop complaining, okay? All I want to do is promote my career. That's all, and yours, and Nancy's. And I'm not gonna do it by sitting at home, waiting for producers to call â€˜cause they don't. Lucas. And Paul is doing a great job for us. - I've heard that before. - You've heard it before. - Yeah, opportunity, opportunities. An opportunity auction. - Lucas. - Might as well be at Lucky's. Those so-called film producers you hang out with at your table. Jesus, Jezebel, what are you doing? - Lucas, come on. Just relax. - Look, I gotta work tonight. Why don't you just go and enjoy yourself at the auction. - Call me, Lucas? - We have a 13,000 dollar bid. 13,000. Going. Going. Sold to the gentleman in table five. - There there, pumpkin. What's the matter? - Oh, men. Sometimes they're so insensitive. - Oh god darling, don't I know it. But here, you're gorgeous. This ought to cheer you up. - Who is this? - The most suave and debonair man in the whole entire world. Dr. Elson Po. I took the liberty of making an appointment with him. Dr. Po is a producer. - More cabernet, sir? - He also makes his movies on the island where he makes his wine. I have made arrangements for you even to bring your friends along, if you would like. - Paul, that's terrific. Thank you. - By the way, did you manage to get your physical? - Oh yeah. - You know, all the studios require them in these days. - I did everything you asked me. - Are you a good girl. - And now, ladies and gentlemen, we come to the final auction of the evening. Item 39. This is the last bottle of Dr. Po's highest quality wine.

So you think I'm 10 times better than your husband, huh? - Oh Mark, Mark. Oh. - Yeah! - This is so exciting, Paul. Thanks for bringing us here. - Alright. - What the hell do you want? - Dr. Po says you can take some time off. - It's about time I get a day off. - Permanently. - Son of a bitch! Bastard! Son of a bitch. Come on, bastard. - Good work, Rock. - Your wife says you're a lousy screw. - I saw you. You weren't so hot. Bravo. Bravo. Castrate him. Kill the eunuch. - No! No! - Bury him. Take her down to the dungeon. - Please allow me. - Po, I'm just dying to meet him. - Me neither. - No no, let's not go yet. Counting our chicken. We haven't got anything yet. - Hey look, I just know I'm gonna get that part. I'm not gonna forget you for this, Paul. I promise you that. - So Paul, when do we get the script. Calm down, you boys and girls. This man is a jet setter. He knows some of the world's most influential people. - Well, how's Mrs. Po? You waiting for a street car or something, huh? - Bastard. - Looks like your schooling days are over, my dear. You liked it while it lasted, didn't you? My dear Cynthia. How are you, huh? How are you, Martha, huh? Good. Stay healthy, huh? - What's that? - Nothing ma'am. Wild dogs. - It's perfect. - This place has such savoir-fair. - Kinda like it myself. - I wonder if the other people have arrived already. Oh, Dr. Po. How do you do, Dr. Po? - Paul. - My I introduce you to these most charming young ladies. This is Jezebel Fairchild, and this is Nancy Stone. They are both aspiring actresses, and very talented. And this is Lucas Carol. - It's nice to meet you, sir. - A pleasure. - Lucas is a blossoming martial arts talent, I would say he's a leading man type. And this is Brian Wrightman. He has a high school diploma. - Hey Dr. Po. I'd just like you to know, you know, I'm really grateful for you giving me this break. And I promise you, you won't be disappointed. I'd like to show you my-- - Dr. Po, and this is Jeremy Young. - Ah, Mr. Young. You're the reporter who wrote that very interesting article about my wine. - Yes, he is a very bright young man. - So it seems. - I was hoping for an interview. I'd like to do a follow-up story. - I'm honored. My island and all it has to offer is yours. The Phoenix knows no horizon in heaven. And so it shall be for all of you this weekend. My assistant Rock will see to your every needs. The rest of the guests have already arrived. So let's have some fun. Come. - Alright, let's do it. - I can't wait to see what's inside. - Jezebel. Isn't this place great? - Oh, it's wonderful. - Oh my God, you are so beautiful. - Not here, Lucas. - What? Come on, Jez. It's not like we're strangers or something. - Not in front of everyone. - Great moves. Yeah. - Alright. - Yeah alright. Do it, yes. Look at him go. - Yeah. - Look at him dance. - Come on. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Go Lucas, yeah, come on. - Oh that's great. - Fooled you. Let the party begin. - That's a nice ring. - Thank you. - Hello, Brian, right? - I think we should have lunch next week. - Sure. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You have a nice costume here. - Yeah. - Is this your costume? - Yeah, it's my costume. - This wine is so good. It makes you just want to drink more and more and more. - Oh, this is just like sex. - How you doing? - I'm doing okay. - How about you and I kind of get together later, hm? - Go go go. - Try this! You too. - These are delicious. What are these? - This is Dr. Po's specialty. Here, my dear, have some. - These are bitter as hell. Tastes like spiders. - No, no no no. - These are delicious. - Come on. - I like 'em, Brian. - Yes yes yes, good girl. Yes. You too. You should also have some. - No more for me. - Dr. Po. - Ah, are you having a good time? - Great time. - Fabulous, really nice. - God, I couldn't imagine it was so much fun here. Thank you. - Yes have some wine. - No thank you. - You're not drinking. You're not planning on driving, are you Jeremy? - No sir, it's just that I don't drink, not really. - Well strange that you should write that article about wine and me. - I do write about wine, yes. But I'm more interested in you as a person. As an individual. I'm here to learn about how you've acquired such great fame as a wine maker. - It's really quite simple. There's always a balance. Avyin and a yang if you will, that animates all of our lives. - What do you mean, Dr. Po? - The Chinese believe in twin ethers that encompass the whole universe. The yin is the female side of heavy and dark. The male side is the bright and heaven. This eternal struggle for balance. It inhabits all of our lives. - And how is that related to the success of your wine making, Dr. Po? - He flatters me. I'm not that successful. In fact, I'm still looking for that balance, that something missing. - The perfect ingredient. - Dr. Po, you're a truly fine wine maker. Almost obsessed. - Yeah do it, get to it! - No no, Jeremy. You have to excuse him, Dr. Po. This young man has a very sharp acid tongue. - Yeah yeah. - Hey let's go outside. - Let's go! - I gotta dance, I gotta dance. - You got wine all over yourself, I think. - I know. - Dance, Jezebel, dance. I love to see you dance, yes. - Dr. Po. Are they not a healthy looking group of young people? - Yes, they are. - They are the correct type, sir. Here is the labs report and the blot tests. - Thank you, Paul. Hello, hello. Dance. You may go. - Excuse me, Dr. Po. I could use an increase in my salary. My costs are going up all the time, and this is particularly good group of people, if I may say so. - Paul. I will include a big bonus for you next delivery, now go. Please. - Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. - Wonderful, wonderful. Dance all through the vineyard. - Oh my God, I've never felt this free before. I could dance forever. - More of this wine. I'm drinking it by the bottle. - Help me. - No, no. - Nancy! What's wrong? - Lucas, it's over there. It's right over there. - What's over there, what is it? - I don't know. It was this horrible thing. This like a dog or something, I don't know. Wild, I don't know. -A god? - And then there was this skull or something, that's horrible. - Well show me where it is. - It was right over there. Right there, right there. - Over here? - Yeah. It was right there. - The skull? - It's there, Lucas. It's right there, the skull. - Nancy, there's nothing down here but dirt. - No, there is a skull. Look, these are my shoes. - These are your shoes, Nancy, but... Nancy, you've had too much wine. - No, Lucas, the wine has nothing to do with it. - What's wrong? - There was this skull or something, I don't know. It was horrible, it was hideous. - Yes Ivan, hurry up. I have to get the boat. Oh Ivan. Ivan. Ivan. Ivan. Ivan. - Hey Nancy, there's another-- Excuse me. - For me. - Okay. - Whoa, hey, what's going on here? Is this a massage parlor, or something? - His neck. - What's wrong? - That feels good. - Perhaps I can help. - What? - Excuse me. Now does it hurt right here? - Hey wait hey hey hey, what are you doing? - He's gonna stick those pins in you. - Doc, look, can we talk about this? - I assure you Brad you're going to be in complete safety. Just relax now. But let's just say there are some side effects. - Side effects? What side effects? - Well let's just say that your sexual libido is likely to receive a boost. - Libido? - Getting it on, Brad. - Oh yeah? Really? - Now just relax. - Hey, I'm afraid of needles. Is it in yet? Ow. - How does that feel? - Ooh, ooh. Ooh, that's stimulating. - And this one over here. - Where'd that last needle go? - He dropped it. - It's in his hand, he palmed it. - That feels nice, man. It feels real, that is nice, ooh. Yeah. Ooh. - You're a good patient. - My neck feels great. - How about this one, Brad? - Oh. I can really feel it in my whole body. My whole body. - Just remember, Emperor Ming insisted upon daily treatments. He had over 100 wives. - 100 wives. Well hey, if it was good enough for the Emperor, it's good enough for me, you know. Ooh, I feel good. - You'll feel even better tonight. Very powerful. - Very powerful. Okay, Claudia. - But I hardly know you. - Well, it's about time we took care of that. - Oh Brad, Brad. - What? - Oh, my hair. - Ooh. Wow. You're... - My my my, aren't we cozy here? - Let him alone. He's doing okay. - Come on, Claudia, let's go. - Later. - What? - Later. - Got it made! - Go back to your grave. Alan Steven is loose in the vineyard again. Why did you not throw sacred earth on him? - I tried. And so did Smith. But there are just too many of them out in the vineyard. And they're out of control. - My prayers are keeping them down. - But their souls are restless, master. They want to go home. Perhaps we can remove some of the bodies and transport them back to the mainland. - No. We will continue to cover their graves with sacred earth. Go. - Alright. Alright alright. - Who's there? - It's me, it's me. - Who's me? - Come on, Celeste. It's me. Claudia said come back later, remember? - Yeah, much later, like tomorrow. - Come on, where is she? Claudia. - Those needles must be getting to you, huh? - Celeste, stop it. Tell him I'll be there in a few minutes. - Says she'll be there in a few minutes, Brad. And you better go get yourself spruced up, and get that five o'clock shadow off your face. - You think? - 100 wives, huh? Alright big guy. - Brad. A surprise for you, huh, Brad? - Alright. Ow. Huh. - Do you think he's cute? - He's kinda cute. He's kind of cute. - I think he's really cute. - I'm so nervous about this audition tomorrow. The way this... - Oh no, what is it? - Did you just hear something? - No. - Did you like my treatment, huh? - Mama! Mama! - Mama, mama! - I'm gonna go get something to eat. - Okay, night night. - Mayan God of the winds. You have shown me my chosen bride. Soon, soon she shall be yours. - Lucas. What are you doing here? - I was gonna have a drink with Jezebel. - Well, I'll have a drink with you. To success. - To new discoveries. - Mm, these noodles look so delicious. - My mother's recipe. Let me help you. Open wide. - I hope that's good manners. - Oh that's quite good manners. The louder one is the more compliments to the chef. - She told me that you two have never, you know, you know, done anything. - She told you that? - Yeah, well, I'm sure it's not you. Hey, I am sure it's not you. - It belonged to my father. He was a warrior of the Ching Dynasty. - Did he die in battle? - No. He died near our house, by that sword. - Were you with him? - Yes. And so was she. People spoke of her as the fairy daughter of the heavens. - She looks so spiritual. Did you believe what they said about her? - Of course. She was a princess. A blithe spirit who believed her pleasure seeking would never end. - And you take after her. I'm in love with this island of yours. It's like a world that's all gone. Except for the little bits and pieces. I feel like I'm looking into the past. - You are looking into the past. But it can be your future also if you want it to be. I've been observing you ever since you arrived. I prayed that you would come, and here you are. Tell me that you have never seen me in your dreams. - I may have. - You have. There are forces long forgotten existing here, driving the bits and pieces, as you call them, together. We are but little fragments, drifting, searching, drawn to each other. I need you to be with me. I need you to trust me, Jezebel. - Oh no. - Help us. - Oh no. Oh geeze. - Help us. Help us. - Mm. Mm. These strawberries are perfect. Try one, Jez. - I'm not hungry. I don't ever want to leave here. - Hey Jez. You weren't in your bedroom last night. - I was having a snack. Were you spying? - Listen, do we have a problem here? - Lucas. I don't want to talk about it right now. - Hey Jeremy. - Hi everybody. - Where you been? - I feel asleep in the library last night. Woke up there this morning. - Boy, you sure are a bookworm. - I'm finding out a lot about Dr. Po and his background. - And? - Well, I can't put my finger on it. There's something about the stuff in his books, and his wine making, and the mysticism. - Whoa. I got a heavy duty scene coming up. I can't handle it. - Did you see Claudia and Celeste? - No, should I have? - I'll go check on 'em. - That won't be necessary. I had to send the three of them back home early this morning. They just didn't seem the right type for my movie. - Oh, and they didn't bother to say goodbye. - Well that's funny. - I hope you're all ready for the audition? - Dr. Po. I had the pleasure of reading your book on wine making last night. It's terrific stuff. I feel like you've pulled me into a different world. I mean, just by reading it, it's so intricate in its description. - Jeremy, I see you found my library very entertaining. - To say the least. I mean, that stuff about the ancient Chinese drinking Mother of Pearl and jade powders to prolong life. That was incredible. Do you find that there's any truth in their beliefs? - Oh yes, of course. The jade in particular is a well known source of prolonging life. - Is there any other research that I could possibly read? - Jeremy, Jeremy. Why don't we wait until later, alright? I have these people waiting here for the audition. - I'm sorry, Dr. Po. I don't mean to monopolize your time. - Oh that's quite alright. - Thank you very much. - Now everybody, would you gather over here? Please come over here. - Damn, I should have taken those Chinese lessons. - That must be Po's father. Sow. Oh, that's the character for long life. - Dr. Po, when I woke up this morning, there was a deer right outside my window. - Wonderful, there are many around this area. Jezebel, what you did in that audition was marvelous. Your flow of personal feelings really moved me. It seems to come so easily for you. - Oh, well it doesn't usually. But last night, my experience with you, God, it seemed to just open me up. I feel like there's a whole new world inside of me. - Hey that's a nice ring. - Your spirit and mine are just beginning to move together in a circle of yin and yang. You must stay on this island to complete that circle. - I want to. But, I am so confused. There's so many feelings inside of me, I am so-- - Dr. Po. Excuse me, Jezebel. I have some questions that I must ask you right away. Do you mind if we continue our interview now? There's a book there in your library, and there's one picture in particular of an amulet that dates back to the Ming Dynasty. Now legend has it that that piece was worn by a goddess. Daughter of . - Why are you telling me all this? - Well the amulet in the book is very much like the one you're wearing. Or is it the other way around? As you see, yours is chiseled around the edges. But the design in the center is exactly the same. - I'm afraid your imagination is getting carried away, Jeremy. There are many sow character amulets just as there are crosses in the world. But only one is used to crucify Jesus Christ. - In your collection of clippings, there was a mention of a Vincent Po, proprietor of a winery in the Yucatan in the mid 19th Century. Just as he appeared he vanished, amid controversy. Prior to his disappearance, there were some very mysterious ongoings at his estates. And then poof, he vanishes. Controversy closed him out. What else can you tell me about this man, Dr. Po? - 19th Century. You've really been doing some digging, haven't you, Jeremy? I tell you what. I think you should relax and enjoy yourself. You know, you may develop a fever from studying too hard. Just forget the library for a while, and when we have our interview, you can pick my brains, and I can pick yours. Goodbye, Jezebel. - Jezebel wait, now wait. Just suppose Dr. Po is that man in the newspaper articles. - Jeremy. You said yourself that the articles were written from the 1800s. Now how could Dr. Po possibly be the same man? - Look, I don't know, but somehow it all ties together. Look, I read all about the Chinese legends and prolonging life. I got a strong feeling about this, Jezebel, and I know you do, too. - Yes, I do. Dr. Po is a special man, Jeremy, and he's good to me. That's something that you don't see. Or you don't want to. - What, do you feel like you've gotta be with him, do his will? Is that right? Is that being good to you? Is that being good to you? Look, I saw you two from up there, okay. I was standing in the window. I could sense something wasn't right. Now just listen to me for a second. You're in a lot of danger here. Have you forgotten about Claudia and Celeste and Brad? Do you really think they went home? Look, I found this ring in the winery. - Jeremy. - Now whose do you suppose it is? Ah, ah. - Jeremy? Jeremy, what's going on, what's wrong? - I can't, I can't breathe. - Somebody help! - Are you choking? Jeremy, sit down. What's going on? Okay just stay there, relax. I'm gonna go get Dr. Po, Jeremy. Just relax. Dr. Po! Dr. Po! - No, no! - Dr. Po! Dr. Po! Dr. Po. Something's wrong with Jeremy. He's sick. He's like he was all burning up inside. - Calm down. - I don't know, something's wrong. - Where, where is he? - He's outside. Come on, help him. He needs your help. Jeremy, Jeremy, are you okay? - Jeremy? He feels alright. - Jeremy? - He is sweating, but he's cool now, feel. - Dr. Po, it was the weirdest thing. It was like he was on fire. - He's alright. I'll have my men attend to him immediately. Come. Come, Jezebel. Come, come. - Oh geeze, Jezebel. Jesus. - Good girl, Claudia. - Oh my god, oh my god. Jezebel! - Jezebel. Do you wish to give yourself to eternity? - Yes, Dr. Po. I want to stay with you. - Come, lie down. - Jezebel! Jezebel! Jezebel! Jezebel! Jezebel! - No! - Who are you? Can you speak? Why is Po keeping you here? The amulet. It's yours. - No power shall be greater than mine. No power! - You okay, you alright? - Yeah. - Let's go. Come on. Are you gonna be alright? - Yeah. - Take care of yourself. I gotta find Jezebel. - What do you think you are doing? You robbed me of my justice. You have no right. You are evil, mother. Now your immortal family in heaven will never forgive you. And don't you dare try to take my chosen bride from me. I've searched a thousand lifetimes for her. Now she has finally come. She will make me a perfect sacrifice, and then I will never need this silly amulet of yours anymore. You recognize this? It's your husband's. See, feel it. I'll kill you the next time you interfere with my plans, mama. - I know I heard screams. Check the bedrooms. - Right. - What was that? Is he wearing another one of those masks? - Hell no, that's real. Let's check it out. - Lucas. - Oh geeze. He saw us. Go. - Scarecrow, get 'em! - Son of a bitch! - I hate to tell you this, but there's no string for this bow. - I know that, Nancy. I know that. Why do you think I haven't fired it yet? - They're someplace. - Ivan. - The bow, give me the bow. We've gotta find something for the bow. - Hurry Lucas, we gotta go. - Go, go. - Where are we gonna go? - Up here? - Okay okay okay, go go go. I can't do this, I just can't do this. I can't do this. - Stop. - Lucas, what are we gonna do? - I don't know. - What are we gonna do? - Nancy, please. - Dr. Po, he's a madman. What are we gonna do? - Listen, sh, calm down. I'm gonna get us out of here, okay? It's gonna be okay. - He's got so many-- - Sh, it's gonna be okay. I'm gonna get us out of here. Just relax. - Okay. What is this? - I just grabbed it from the house. It's a dagger. I don't know. - It's awfully small. - Oh, down. - No. - Someone's coming. Go. - No, no. No. No, no. Help. - Jezebel, Jezebel. Jezebel, wake up. Jezebel, wake up. What is this? Come on, Jezebel, wake up. Ah, ah, ah. - I don't remember inviting you into my bedroom, Jeremy. What, you trying to say something? Drag him to the dungeon. Prepare the altar. Jezebel. Jezebel, awake. Come. - So you like books, huh? You like to read, huh? I'll give you something to read. - Oh geeze, oh. Oh Jesus, oh. - Put on your robe and follow me. - Tina. Tell me more about the amulet. Tell me more about the jade amulet that he wears. - Yes, the amulet. Oh, it's so beautiful and it's so precious to him. He always grabs for it when-- - When what? When what? - When he has those nightmares. When he's growing old. Get it. Get the amulet. - Tina. Tina. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. - Maybe they're in here. - Oh my god. - Over here. - Jeremy, thank God. - Oh. - Get me down. Get 'em off. - What happened? - I think she's dead. - Where? - Keys on the wall. Get 'em off. - Oh god, this guy is alive. - Just a minute, hun. - God damn it. - Are you alright? - Yeah. - What's going on? What is this place? - These girls are dead. Are you okay? We're gonna get you out of here. Okay. How are we gonna do this? - Are you okay? Oh Jesus. - Where are the keys? Give me the keys. - What's happening? Jeremy, where's Jezebel? - I don't know. Dr. Po's got her. He's gonna sacrifice her. - What? - He's gonna sacrifice her. - Let's get out of here. Let's go, let's find her. - We gotta get out of here. - Come on. Go, go. - Do you see Jezebel? - I don't know. - There she is, there she is. - That way. Come on. Let's go this way. - Drink, my love. - Shit. - Oh no, the string broke. - Wait. - Scarecrow. - Go down there. - Right. - You, leave him alone! - Sleep well, my love. Get that amulet! My amulet! - Stop! - Jesus. Jezebel, are you okay? - No, I'm not okay. - Are you okay? - Let me get you, okay? - No. - We gotta get you out of here. Come on. - Lucas, why has Jeremy cut Po's books? - I don't know. He seems changed. - Let's go home, Jeremy. - Where's my amulet?
