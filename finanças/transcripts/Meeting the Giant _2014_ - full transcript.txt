Good morning Yes, I read it Alright Right Ok, ok Right away Come in Hello, Mr. Wu Hey, superstar, why are there so many ships out there? Singapore has... the world's busiest port, Every ship would come to us You're kidding, how is that possible? Of course it's possible! Many come to Singapore to live permanently too What do you want to eat? Nope. Let's go to the beach I heard you and Chen Hang do not get along? Not at all I even send him home very often! You envy him? What are you envious about? His height? No way, there's so many tall people in the team, what's there to be envious about? Look, he's tall too right? Even his surname is Gao (tall in Chinese) So we're all brothers, right? We have a Yao Ming, and a superstar I'm not! I don't like it when people call me superstar I don't like people calling me Yao Ming Anything you like Shaohua! Shaohua! It's you! What a coincidence! Can we have a photo together? Of course! Call me Chen Hang Hang means to set sail; My mother isn't educated, It took her a lot of time and effort just to pick my name from the dictionary She hoped that I would see the world be ambitious and knowledgeable ok So we have Yao Ming sailing on and Singapore's basketball future staring each other down, right? Yes? Hahaha! This looks good Yongde, Mr. Long's time is precious, so let's just go straight to the point You know that Mr. Long has high expectations for the team You just have to ensure that they do well It's that simple That simple? I don't believe Mr. Wu do you really think they'll stay after succeeding? Why not train our own people? Give our own a chance! Whose side are you really on? Just ask if you need anything Just submit a video and written report of their training They obviously lying about their age How can anyone so young be that tall? I'll expose you to the press! Update me on their progress I'll handle the press I know you won't let me down, I'll leave it to you then Why aren't you answering my calls? Say something! Zhang Fang! Do you care about how I feel? What about you? What about my feelings when you were flirting with those girls? You threw my hand away when they came over. What do you take me for? You're jealous over us taking photos? You're being petty! It's not about the photos, Don't you get what I'm saying? Isn't it about the photos? You're too much What are you doing? Zhang Fang, don't be angry, this is for you Get some rest Yes, sir Well done, my girl We live by principles You're like your mother When need be, give him a hard time Not bad Staring won't stop the rain, will it? Tonight's game is off for sure Forget it Seems like tall people can't get enough oxygen to the brain Do you really need your hands to see if it's raining? Use your eyes, stupid! Seriously Coach should have called to cancel the match Perhaps he's waiting for the rain to stop Doesn't matter, they're just a bunch of old folks Yeah, I'd rather not play, this is the best weather to sleep! How's things between you and Zhang Fang? Mind your own business Hey, the rain stopped What? Who you trying to kid? Do you really need your hands to see if it's raining? Use your eyes! Seems like short people can't get enough oxygen to the brain too Haha, you're an idiot! What are you trying to say? So what if you're tall! Hello? Hey, I'm talking to you! Ok, ok Move out! Coach is waiting for us! What about you? Are you going? Is it right? Yes! Do you even want to play? What for? Look at the time! Its unbecoming! Hey, coach! Looks like the referee won't be coming Let's just have some fun My friend ah Xiong will help out Ah Xiong! He'll be the referee, ok? Feel free to back out if you are afraid, OK? Be careful, they're former national players Team Xin Miao! 1, 2, 3, WOO! Wow, you're quite tall Watch it, we were national players Go jump the ball Me? Go ahead Don't worry about these oldies, go! Ok Chen Hang, I'll jump Come on, let me do it! This dunk, was exactly like the first time we won Suddenly, I had a really bad feeling What's wrong with you? I'm not afraid, come on! What's your problem? Go take a look Why are you pushing me? I'm not afraid of you! I never thought our first defeat would come like this Can I see the statistics? You only care about yourself? Gao Ming! What? Look all you want! Gao Ming, calm down! Gentleman, had enough yet? Why look at the statistics? They are just numbers We need numbers, but we need a plan We lost today, what about tomorrow? What's going to happen after this? It's not about where you play but how you play it It's not about your opponents but yourself You're blinded by your ego, and it affected your performance We won so many times, doesn't that count? That's only because... you've never had real competition I was too lenient in pointing out your problem They fouled us first! Exactly, that's not how you play basketball Precisely, coach Yeah, they were not professional! They fouled on purpose! They're sore losers! You panicked because they fouled you hard? So you resorted to violence because of that? There is only one word for you, disgraceful! Bloody disgraceful! It was only then I realized, The pressure that they had to live with, was way above other boys their age I don't know why, but since that night no matter how hard they tried, they just kept losing Mr. Long spent so much time and effort, hoping that they would perform And you did promise us... results, no? Mr. Long, they're still young, please give them more time Time is money, time is precious and money is priceless Losing is not an option Mr. Long, they were getting arrogant, Losing a few games, will help them grow in the long run So how many more matches do you intend to lose? I want them to win, not lose Not a single match! I've decided, after three months To protect the team, the committee will keep the media away from you We will intensify your training, once you're ready, we will arrange a decisive match So stay focused, do not be distracted However, because of your losses, the committee will deduct $500 from your allowances for the next 3 months What? $500? How can you? $500 is a lot! It's unreasonable! It struck me, at that point, that they depended on basketball for a living Mother, the landlord said that utility fees will increase again next month We have to be more prudent with our money Ok And, I won't need the mobile phone anymore, so you don't have to top-up my prepaid card Why not? Then how am I going to contact you? You can always leave a note at home I'm either at home, school, or training Actually, I might stop training as well I've long told you to stop basketball How are you going to become a surgeon if your hand's injured? Chen Hang, Gao Ming, Da Di Chen Hang, Gao Ming Chen Hang Zhang Fang Chen Hang Hello mother, it's me How's father? Did he take his medicine? What? I can't hear you Hey, turn it down Hello? Mother! Are you nuts? Don't take it out on the phone! You'll pay for it? Hey! Why did you turn off my TV? The TV isn't yours, it belongs to everyone Well, it's none of your business Only you watching? Do you pay the bills? Always taking forever to shower, you think water is free? What are you trying to say? What's going on? Discipline your brother! What did you do? It wasn't my fault He's crazy! Move! There's no need for these Better safe than sorry They've told us Singapore has everything And you believe just like that Exactly! I married you because I believed you, so stop nagging! Son, this won't take up much space, Take it, to remember home Why are you crying? He's making us proud by going to Singapore! Call us often when you get there, Let your mother know you're safe You have to stop getting into fights again, and control your temper, ok? Yes Son, you chose this path, so you must persevere ok? I will Father, please take care of your health Mother, stop crying please Training has begun for the big match It was tough, but brought us closer I felt for the first time, that we were united as a team Xin Miao! Xin Miao! Xin Miao! Xin Miao! Excited Tired Understand? The present tense is: I wait The past tense would be: I waited Teacher, then why is it we won and not we win-ed? It's different. English is so difficult Chinese is much simpler without past or present tenses Why do we need to learn English anyway? English is essential in Singapore Teacher, is American English the same as Singapore's? Same words different pronunciation Teacher, do you have a boyfriend? Busybody Repeat after me: When you are excited, keep calm When you are tired, rest well Hey! What are you doing? Get up! Get up get up now, you crazy boys! I am still hungry! Seriously, you're writing postcards? Just use WeChat I know, but my folks are nostalgic, any problem? Nah, not at all So, want to try it? Oldies love such stuff Why not! We're brothers, let's be silly together Brother, what are you thinking about? Shall we write a postcard and send it home? What's wrong? Dad and mum must be really lonely without us right now Everyone's missing home tonight All of you I'll get it Who is it? I'm coming It's you, come in! Guess what we brought? Zhang Fang? No, it's food Food? Zhang Fang's oranges? No, look! Stop playing, let them have it What's this? Rice dumplings? Hey! There's rice dumplings! Rice dumplings? I want one! Me too! Hey, you guys eating without washing your hands? Thank you Mr. Wu! You're welcome It's the Dumpling Festival today I wanted you to have the festive mood and be happy What's wrong? I miss my mother's homemade dumplings Home sick? Then take us as family You have brothers and an uncle here Exactly, we're family I know that the Dumpling Festival is a significant day to all of you. As athletes, this day should be a celebration of health and happiness, right? Yes, indeed Come on, eat! This is Singapore's famous Nonya dumpling What's Nonya? What's that? Never mind, let's eat Why are you back? I forgot to take the dumplings for my mum My dad's taking them over right now Ok then, good night Chen Hang! Sorry about what happened in the past What happened in the past? When we bullied you in school, and the prank that got you injured Oh that It was Jia Qiang who poured soap on the floor I saw it Actually, I fell on purpose What? I could smell it after opening the door When I saw soapy water on the floor, I guessed as much and you I made a decision I figured since you all hated me, if getting injured meant you would accept me, then so be it So, you chose to stay on the bench Well you still won, right? Chen Hang, I've handed the dumplings to your mother Thank you Mr. Wu My mother will be happy. Good night Chen Hang! Good night. Good bye Dad. Yes? Why are rice dumplings so significant to them? They're from China, I guess it's because of Qu Yuan (Chinese poet) Qi yuan ($7)? That's expensive No wonder the reaction How's Qu Yuan (poet) expensive? Isn't Qi yuan ($7) expensive? Qu Yuan(poet) is expensive? One for Qi yuan ($7) is so expensive! Of course there's only one Qu Yuan(poet), how can there be two? If there's two, then it should be $350 each What on earth are you talking about? Good I can tell they're working hard Great improvement I'm looking forward to the upcoming match Mr. Long, I've look at the numbers, the budget is well under control and we have support from most of the committee to continue the program Mr. Long, I personally guarantee that they will perform to your expectations It's all my fault, they are innocent They're innocent? So it's my fault? No, that's not what I meant Shut up! Remember who is the boss! Father, what happened? Chen Hang, Dadi, Jiangyi, Lijie, Wangmao, to my right Shaohua, Gao Ming, Xiaodi, Songqiang, Zhicheng, to my left From now on, you'll be split into two teams Remember your teammates, and your opponents This weekend, both teams will be playing against each other in a deciding match The Chairman Mr. Long, and the committee, will be watching you play You fate shall be determined by your performance Determine what? What fate? The committee shall decide who stays, and who will go Coach, what do you mean? It will be an elimination match I've decided, after three months, you will hold an elimination match The weaker players shall all be fired, keeping only the best When I decided to let you lose, I wanted you to understand how pride comes before a fall I never expected you to meltdown the way you did I totally miscalculated As your coach, my duty is to protect you But I can't do it anymore, many things are now beyond my control I have put you in this predicament For that, I am truly sorry You ok? He chose basketball He blames me for not telling him, he blames my dad too An apple a day, keeps you far away He used my words to break up with me Actually, he's reaction is understandable Your dad should have told everyone earlier How can you blame my father? You father knew the plan too, why didn't he tell others? Your dad knew that Mr. Long's a sore loser, So why did he agree to letting the team to lose? He should've called for a timeout to re-group! It was part of my father's strategy, your father was there too, if he didn't agree with it, he should have said something as the manager! Why do you keep blaming my dad? You blamed my father first My dad had no choice My father too! My father's feeling really guilty about this My dad too What about you? You had no choice too? Cheer up You do have other options you know All depends on you We'll see Uncle, I'm off! Take care! Goodbye, auntie! Da Di, your brother is immature, take care of him I will father, don't worry I'll do it Son, remember to eat enough It's hot over there, drink lots of water Yes, ok Son, let me look at you again Mother, I'm not a small boy anymore I know what to do, don't mess up my hair It's late, time to go Alright, alright We're off, mother We're off, father Get up the truck Mother, we're leaving Take care of your brother I will My sons, please be safe We will, see you Take care of your brother, call us when you get there I'll eat the buns, mother! We're off, farewell Goodbye Brother, in a few days we will We're not even on the same team Do your best, understand? What if we're up against each other? If that really happens then you'll have to score What are you talking about? Give everything you've got On the court, you are my enemy I won't give you any chance I won't need you to! It better be Remember how difficult it was for you to come this far Today, you do not play for anyone But only for yourself This is my last day as your coach I hope with all my heart that I will still see you tomorrow Come Team Xin Miao! Looks like this shall be their final game one that nobody desires to be in What kind of defense is that? If they keep this up, fire them all! The committee shall decide, who stays, and who will go Are you mad? He is one of us! Chen Hang, are you ok? You hypocrite! You never gave a damn about anyone! So stop acting! I just want to play well You are not even trying if we keep this up, we'll all be sent home! So what? Look at us now! Will you be happy if you stayed? Are you happy? Are you? I'm not! Neither am I! I gave up my life in China for basketball I sacrificed everything I loved for basketball Since I have chosen to come here, I cannot fail I have to succeed! What are you yelling about? It's always about you! Have you ever spared a thought for us? Shaohua, you're too selfish! Why are you picking on me? I've done nothing wrong! You bastard! Enough! What is wrong with us? Don't forget we are all from China! We should be united, helping one another, not turning on each other like this! If our folks back home to see what we have turned into, They would be so heartbroken Chen Hang's right Remember what Mr Li Qiang told us before we came here? Have we forgotten our mission? It's time to wake up! Skills aside character and determination are more important As professionals, you were chosen to represent another country with your talent you must integrate into the local culture Not only do you carry the expectations of family and friends, but also the duty you have to your countrymen Sports isn't all about winning, it's about sportsmanship Your journey shall be difficult some might even lose their way So it is important that you support one another Remember, basketball is not about personal glory but about your team and your country However, your path might be, I hope you'll hold these words within your heart That whatever happens, you will stand united I wish you success Whatever happens today, we will always be brothers Let's put everything aside, and end this game with dignity, ok? He's right Not for one, but for all Not for one, but for all Team Xin Miao! 1, 2, 3, WOO! Good play! Great shot! What if we're up against each other? If that really happens, then you'll have to score I won't give you any chance! I won't need you to! Well done Chen Hang, Gao Ming, Wang Shaohua, He Xiaodi Follow me to the office The rest may go Damn it! You lied to us! I don't want to go home! Forget it. Why do you want me to go home? Stop embarrassing ourselves, let's go Well, at least one of us is staying, I guess we can call it a success What am I to do when you're not around? Isn't that good? No one to bother you anymore I won't be bugging you to get up, brush your teeth, to eat and sleep Come on, stop crying Time to grow up and not be a child anymore, Understand? Promise me you'll take care of yourself Do your best don't let us down Here Come on Cheng! Your laundry is in the wash, get it later I have to rush to the airport! Ok, thanks! You better go! I'm sorry. So sorry Lots of housekeeping... to do, my fault, sorry It's ok, Chen Hang isn't here yet anyway So Chen Hang is really quitting basketball? Yeah, I heard he got a scholarship Scholarship? Where is he going? Europe Europe? Really? I'm so thirsty, let me have some Hey, I'm so sorry You're so late! What's your excuse? I had lunch with my mother, sorry Woah, 'SORRY' Speaking English now huh? Listen to me you better work hard on your English over there The past tense of I win is I won, not I win-ed! He's not like you, he's got a scholarship! Yes, you're good Oh yes, how's it been since Shaohua moved into your place? You mean for me, or him? What about Gao Ming? Where's he? Gao Ming's can't come, he's got a meeting Meeting? What for? He didn't say In the beginning there were 10, now only 3 You have the greatest potential I want to groom you to be our nation's representative The recommendation letter is here, all you need to do is sign it You discarded my friends after using them do you even think I will trust you? How dare you speak to me like that! My mother once told me, when men lose their temper, they lose their worth Thanks for the offer, but I'm leaving The Long Foundation welcomed their new female basketballers this morning What's do you feel like doing most right now? I love Singapore, and I wanna see the Merlion! We want to raise the standards of basketball in Singapore and re-energize the sport I want them to win the Southeast Asian games in two years attain success in Asian Basketball in 5 years and bring glory to Singapore History's repeating itself Will they ever learn? Such a shame Chen Hang! I wonder when will we be able to play basketball together again In our dreams I guess Yeah We... We'll always be the best teammates, right? Goodbye Chen Hang! Farewell, Yao Ming Farewell, Yao Ming Goodbye Team Xin Miao! 1, 2, 3, WOO! Shaohua transformed into a team captain, is well loved and respected. Gao Ming returned to China, joined the National team, and is the star player Chen Hang received full scholarship to study in UK and is no.1 student He Xiao Di plays in the pro-league and was promoted to Ops Manager. He Da Di leads his team & takes care of his parents, stays close to XiaoDi And me? I joined the Singapore Youth Basketball team and my new goal in life is romancing Zhang Fang Though we've gone our separate ways, I often wondered, how great it would be if we played one more game together I know this is just a dream but let's enjoy it!
