He is the smartest guy on the football team. Which is kind of like being the tallest dwarf. [laughing] I'm sorry, are you actually talking to me? My buddy Kurt just asked you a question. What gives you the right to pick on my friend? I mean, look at you. You're a high school has-been waiting to happen. A future gas station attendant. You got a zit right there.

[Heather Duke vomits] Perhaps you didn't hear the bell over all the vomiting. You're late for class. Heather wasn't feeling well. We're helping her. Not without a hall pass you're not.

Friends isn't the right word exactly. It's more like the Heathers are people I work with. And our job is being popular and shit. [school bell rings] Hey, Veronica. You really look beautiful these days. Yeah, well, it's still the same me underneath. Are you sure? Look, I'm sorry I flaked on movie night last week. I've just had a lot going on. You're with the Heathers now. It's exciting. It's-- whatever. [laughs] But we'll hang out soon, I promise. Veronica. Heather requires your presence. Now. How very. Veronica, I need a forgery written in Ram Sweeney's handwriting. You'll need something to lean on. Heather, bend over. [crowd laughs] [Heather C] "Hi, beautiful. I've been watching you and thinking about us in the old days. I hope you can come to my homecoming party this weekend. I miss you, Ram." Put an "XO" after the signature. What's this for anyway? You remember how Ram used to hang with Martha Dumptruck? Yeah, in kindergarten. I mean, we all did. We all didn't kiss on the kickball field. Oh, my God. That's right, I totally forgot. Ram kissed Martha Dumptruck. [laughs] It was disgusting. Perfect. Boys? Over here, please. What do you think Heather wants? My hot body? Hell yeah! Ram, be a sweetie and give this note to Martha Dumptruck for me. What? No! Martha's had a crush on Ram for like 12 years. This would kill her. And come on, Heather, you're bigger than this. Are we gonna have a problem? You got a bone to pick? You've come so far, why now are you pulling on my dick? I'd normally slap your face off, and everyone here could watch. But I'm feeling nice.

Don't just quote Baudelaire at me and then walk away. Excuse me, I didn't catch your name. I didn't throw it. Who does the guy in the jacket think he is anyway, he's Bo Diddley?

[gasps] Oh, there it is. [crowd laughs] [whimsical music playing] Your mouth was hanging wide open. No, it wasn't. Veronica, drool much? Come on, admit it. You like the new kid. I don't even know his name. You were totally throwing your panties at him. [laughs] [gasps] [crowd laughs] I am talking to my friend. Sorry, Heather. [crowd laughs] Oh, mom, dad, look out. Ah. Here you go, girls. Care for some pate? This isn't pate. It's liverwurst. I'm aware of that, Heather. It's a family joke. [laughs] Oh, funny. [Veronica's dad grunts] Doggone it. Will somebody please tell me why I read these spy novels? 'Cause you're an idiot, dad. Oh, yeah. That's it. [laughter] You two. So, girls, any plans for tonight? Yeah, big homecoming party at Ram Sweeney's house. I'm catching a ride with Heather. Speaking of which. Right. Great pate, mom. But we better motor if we want to be ready for that party. [gasps] Oops. Clean that right now. Do I look like the maid? Veronica, your mom is hilarious. I forbid you to go anywhere with that girl. Mom-- for anything. What they all are, but they will get me safely through high school. I'm not going to change, I promise. So, can I go? Go. What the hell goes on at that school? [giggles] I do not wanna know.

No. But if you're nice, I'll let you buy me a Big Gulp. That's like going to Micky D's to order a salad. Slurpee's the signature dish of the house. Now, did you say cherry or lime? No, I said Big Gulp. I'm Veronica, by the way. Veronica Sawyer. You ever gonna tell me your name? I'll end the suspense. Jason Dean, JD for short. So, JD. That thing you pulled at the caf' was pretty severe. The extreme always seems to make an impression. What brings a Baudelaire-quoting badass like you to Sherwood, Ohio? My dad's work. He owns a deconstruction company. Deconstruction? Yup, the old man seems to enjoy tearing things down. You seen the commercial? "I'm Big Bud Dean. If it's in the way, I'll make your day." Yeah, then he pushes the plunger and the screen blows up. [giggles] Oh, that's your dad? In all his toxic glory. Well, everybody's lives got static. [car horn honking] [Heather C] Veronica!
