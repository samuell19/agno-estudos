You'll gain the trust back of your loved ones and, most importantly, the confidence you need to deal with daily life. Seems nice, doesn't it? I'm going to let you in on a little secret. In 2008, when the Affordable Care Act was signed, it required every health care provider to cover substance abuse treatment. Since the bill was passed, nearly 2,000 sober livings, 100 inpatient treatment centers and 200 detoxes have opened up shop just in Southern California alone. Yeah, business is fucking booming. That's nearly 35,000 beds that need to be filled each month and almost half a million that need to be filled a year. Off the top of my head, that's somewhere around $12 billion annually and again, that's just in Southern California. This is what we in the treatment industry call "the fucking gold rush." Do you want me to fuck with you? Do you want me to fucking fuck with you, bitch? - Don't shoot. - Put the money in the fucking bag! Faster, faster... - Fucking move! - You're gonna make me fucking shoot you? Fucking hurry the fuck up! I'm trying. I'm sorry. Okay, okay. I'm fucking done waiting. Come on. Come on, come on! Hey. Can I get one of those? - Thanks - MAN 2: You good? Hungry? Um, I'll have... That's okay. Get whatever you want. I'll have the Angel Fire burger with fries and a Coke. Mmm-hmm. I'll do the same, thank you. Coffee for me, darlin'. No problem. - Thank you. - You're welcome. So... what are your names? I'm, um, Utah. - This is Opal. - Ha! Utah and Opal. Those are some names. I'm Wood. You with a church group or something? - No. - Hmm? It just takes more than an angel fire burger to get some pussy around here. Opal, what the fuck? What? It's cool. I get it. Can't be too careful, right? Uh, you guys from around here? I am. She's from, um... She's from Cleveland. What... what about you? Near Chicago. I moved to LA, though. Why... why are you here? You know, came through for some business. How's here compared to Cali? Close second. Ever been? - Oh, we've never left Ohio. - Uh-huh. I went to Pittsburgh once for a school trip. Zoo and shit. Uh-huh. Never seen the beach, huh? Yeah Yeah. So, um, how long you guys been getting high? Excuse me? I'm not trying to start any problems. I've been there. It wasn't that long ago I was in the exact same situation that you guys are in. I know what it feels like. What kinda sick shit is this? I fucking knew you were from a church. I'm not with a church. I work in treatment. That's it. - Opal, chill the fuck out. - Let's get out of here. Calm down. Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you. - No problem. Aren't you gonna eat? I'm not hungry anymore. - Look, we're being stupid. You ate... - Ugh! - You ate the last time I did. I'm starving. - I'm fine. All right. I'm out. I'll pay for the food upfront. Here's my card. Give me a call if you wanna do this again. Hey, thank you, for the burger. No sweat, kid. All right, great job. You have a total of 320 points. You're halfway through round three, and now the questions are worth 400... So, uh, what's up? How'd you do it, man? I mean, how'd you get clean? Treatment. Changed my old friends and habits, made some new ones. It was tough, but worth it. How'd you get to treatment? I met a dude much like myself. He set me up. He set you up, what? You... you set people up? Is that what you do? I could do that, if that's what you want. How does that work? All right. One, I put you on a plane. Two, you find a new way to live without this bullshit. Three, start over. That's the way this works. Look, you said you never saw the beach, right? - Yeah. - All right, this is your chance. You could change your whole life. Okay, look, say you get down there and you don't like it. I'm willing to bet my last dollar all this shit gonna be right here waiting for you when you get back. That sounds like an expensive plan. Did I say you need money? Did I even... Did I even mention money? Remember what I told you about the affordable Care Act? Well, what that enabled treatment centers to do is take just about anybody who had coverage. Hey, Polly, how you doing? Yeah, yeah. Hey, listen. Um, I got a kid here, man, that wants to start over. We got a bed for him? Ah, great. Hold on a minute. You don't have insurance, do you? No. When there is no coverage, someone like Wood can put them on their company plan. You see, people like Wood are called marketers or brokers. Their job is to place people like Utah in beds at facilities. Big treatment centers run by publicly traded companies can rely on word of mouth, but the typical shop needs boots on the ground. Like Wood. All right. You bet, thanks. All right, I'll call you back. You're all set, buddy. You and your girl. I gotta talk to her. I leave tomorrow. Look, I know it sounds crazy, but... don't wait to start the rest of your life. This shit ain't worth it. You fucking listening to yourself? You're gonna go with a stranger to fucking California? You don't know anything about this guy. But he seems okay to me. Because he bought you a fucking burger? That's all the proof you need? You're fucked. You're fucked. Listen, Opal, now, I know this sounds stupid... But I'm tired. You know, I can't keep doing this. And here comes this guy... This could be a fresh start for us. Have you thought about how this ends? Wanna end up in fucking jail? Or worse, dead. What do you want? I don't know. But not this. All right. Well, then go. Get the fuck out of here. Opal! Please don't do this. Get the fuck out of here. We're fucking done. Get your shit and leave. Look, man, I'm sorry, but trust me, I know, all right? Trying to get clean with someone else is hard as shit. Huh. You probably don't wanna hear that, though, do you? You gotta do this for yourself, man. Nobody else. Probably don't wanna hear that, either. So you got anything on you that I need to know about? Yeah. All right. Do what you gotta do to get rid of it before we go inside. Yeah. You can handle all of that? Yeah, I'll live. And if I don't, just, uh, leave me here. Um, it looks like Wood already sent over your name, your birthday, and your insurance information. What's your DOC? Drug of choice. - Um, crack and... and heroin mostly. - Okay. DOC, enough. And how long? Ten years. When was your last dose? Don't worry, you're not in trouble. Around, um... 3:00 p.m. today. All right, and any family? No. Anyone I can put down for an emergency contact information just in case. Could be an employer, a friend. Anybody, really. I think that is everything we need from you right now. I know you're not gonna be feeling too good soon. So let's get you to your room. Come on. Bathroom's through that door. Why don't you wash up, get some rest. I'll be in in a few hours to get your vitals. Fucking hurry the fuck up! You were scared. Hey, Utah, I have some meds for you to take, okay? Pussy. Utah, I need to do some vitals, okay? I'll be back in a couple hours. Get some sleep. You were scared. Hey, Utah. It's almost over, okay? This city's so fucking dead at night. You hear that? Nothing. How are you feeling? - A little better, I guess. - Mmm-hmm? Well, I'm Dr. White and I will be your therapist while you're here, if that's okay with you. Sure. I'm Utah. They told me that. I like that name. It says here Mr. Wood stumbled across you in Ohio? Yeah. He's a good fella. I remember when he was sitting right where you are now. - You knew Wood? - Sure. I never thought he'd make it, but he did. How about you tell me why you're here? I don't know, I just... Just tired... I guess. Tired is good. Yeah. Says here you've been using 10 years. Why'd you start? 'Cause the people I was around were doing it. People that were looking out for me. And were these people your parents? Just people. Where are your parents? I never knew my dad. My mom... died when I was 14. I'm sorry. How did she pass? - Cancer. - Oh. I see. So you have been on your own for quite a while. Yeah. It can't have been easy. Yeah, sometimes it wasn't. I think I will clear you to start attending the groups, - if that sounds okay with you? - Sure. Shit just happens, and it's like I see red, like I'm on autopilot or something, and then the next thing I know I'm in some motel room with the blinds drawn and there's a pile of blow in the corner and, like, some weird person in bed next to me. But then... I don't know, I just, like, stay there, like, for days sometimes, and then it gets really bad. I... I start, like, hearing things, I don't sleep. I start thinking, like, I'm God's chosen drug addict, and then I can't stop until there's nothing left. And what's that like for your girls? When you come home from going on a run? Um... I mean, they're still young. Um, my youngest is, like... She's just happy to see me home. My oldest one's... She's, like, four now. I can tell she definitely knows, like, something's off. And what's that like? Knowing what she's seen, what she knows at that age? It's fucked up. Um, my mom was like... She was the same with me, but I know that that's not an excuse. I just... I wanna be a good mom. Like, I... I wanna tell them that I'm sorry. But, like, I really mean it, not just say I'm sorry and then do the same fucking thing over and over again. But... I don't know, it's just... It's just really hard. Mmm-hmm. I do know. It's okay. When I was out there, my son, what I put him through, I didn't think I could ever forgive myself. And I had to learn that we can't change what we've done or what's been done to us. But we can change what we do about it. Hmm? - Yeah. - Mmm-hmm. Can anyone relate to what Tina shared? Yeah? Mmm-hmm? Thank you for being brave. All righty, now, before we go, I would like you all to meet Utah. Utah, you wanna introduce yourself? Hello. I'm Utah, from Ohio. And my thing is crack and heroin. Hi, Utah. Nah, don't drink that, don't drink that, don't drink that. They put something in that. That shit's gonna... No, no, no, no, no. I'm not even playing with you. That shit is gonna make you hard as a rock. No joke. You do not wanna get a chub in here. 'Cause you fuck one of these broads and your dick is gonna fall off. Or worse, you could end up a daddy. You got any kids? - No. - Nah, you don't look like you got any kids. I mean, I can't talk shit. I'm sort of a... I'm a two-pump chump at the moment, if you know what I mean. Mmm. I'm Sid. Utah. - You just got out of a group? - Yeah. Mmm. Yeah, I don't go to that shit. When'd you get in? Wednesday night. Day three. Yeah. So they still got you on the subs with a little Valium, huh? I'll give you two packs of cigarettes for a Valium. Where you from? - Ohio. - Yeah, but what center? - "Center"? - What treatment center? I'm not... I'm not from a treatment center. Okay, what? Jail, ward? What? No, it's my first time in treatment. Oh, well, excuse me. So how much are they paying you? What? Are you... Are you serious? I can't tell if you're fucking serious or not. I don't know what you're talking about. Holy fucking shit! You're like a fucking unicorn, you know... Tina! Utah here is a bonified first-timer. He's not making a fucking dollar. Can you believe that shit? I didn't take a dime this time. Utah, if he's being an asshole, you can come sit over here. No, he's... he's fine. You're a real fucking saint, Tina, you know that? Go fuck yourself, Sid. Look, this whole thing is fucking criminal, all right? You just gotta make sure you get yours... UAs! Who's gotta go? Utah, will you pee for me? Um, yeah, sure. All right, I'll see you later, man. Um... So I got you a little something. What! I'm not really supposed to do that, but I think it helps. Thank you. Um... Let's fill her up. - I'll send a tech to come with you. - All right. Yellow gold. You probably wouldn't believe it, but the piss in this cup is worth more than an ounce of white truffle, beluga caviar, platinum, gold, or even rhino horn. Hmm, nice color. Each cup of piss pays $2,000, and each client can test up to five times a week. Do the math. That's $10,000 a fucking week of piss. There are three phases of treatment. Detox. We generally bill 4,000 a day, with the typical stay being between seven and ten days. Next phase is residential. The average stay is 60 days at $2,000 a day. Lastly, is outpatient. We bill $2,500 a day for this. So, based on a 90-day program, detox, residential, intensive outpatient, and UAs, that's $300,000 per person per 90 days. And somewhere like New West has 60 beds. That's $18 million billed every quarter, and, wait for it, 72 million billed a year. You fucking heard me, 72 million. Well, well, well, look at you. Ohio boy makes good. A little sweeter than Lake Erie, huh? A little. Man, I never thought I'd see this. Me either. So, what's up, man? Nothing. Just came to check on you, that's all. See how you were doing. Okay, all right. - All right. - I'm good, I'm good. You know, I've never... I've never felt like this before. Thirty days now. Come on, kid, let's go celebrate. So what did you do when you got out? I mean, I can't go back to Ohio, right? Don't worry about that shit, man. One day at a time, remember? Right. Just keep doing the right thing. Something will fall in your lap, trust me. You spoke to your girl? No, I don't have phone privileges yet, man. Oh, that's right. Really? Only if you want to. Thanks, man. Don't call her here. I don't wanna hear all that lovey-dovey bullshit. Okay. - Hello? - Opal. It's me, Utah. What do you want? Just wanted to check up on you. How's everything back home? The same shit. You famous yet? No. I'm doing well, though. I got 30 days off this shit. I'm so happy for you. Ah. Did you get her? Yeah. Love, man. She'll come around when she's ready. Until then, you just do you. I got your back. Okay? All right. Treatment isn't any different than any other business model. Most comparable is an auto mechanic shop. Like them, we thrive on repeat business. If we don't do a good enough job, they don't come back. If we do too good of a job, they don't come back, either. The catch here is, the success rate in drug rehabilitation is under 10%. That's why you really only need one success story. A poster boy. Good morning. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Vin Lawler. I am the CEO and founder of New West Recovery. After that, there's no incentive to do too well. The only upside is in keeping the beds filled and the money rolling. It is not easy to ask for help. It's not easy at all. In fact, I think it's one of the toughest things in life to do. A lot of you have come close to dying. Hell, some of you have been brought back from the dead. And that is some serious shit. Serious shit. Pardon my language. Fifteen years ago, I raised my hand. And I said, "I'm done. "I am done. "I can't do this anymore. I'm sick. "I'd rather be dead." That's why I know exactly what it feels like to sit right there. Or there. Or there. I know it. That's why it is the greatest privilege in my life to think that I have the chance to help you change yours. We are a family. All right, today's my favorite day, you know why? Today is the day that we get together once a month and we celebrate the milestones that you've achieved. Because every minute sober... is a minute won. Give yourselves a hand. Yeah. Yes! Louder. Louder. Yes! I've just had a hard time with the dreams recently. During the day it's okay. And you think that has anything to do with you discharging next week? I guess. I mean, I've been in here nine fucking months. And how do you feel? I feel ready this time. I think. Do you have plans for when you get out? Things in place to help keep you sober? I have a sponsor this time. Mmm-hmm. Some new girlfriends. - People I can call. - Good. We will miss you. But it is time for you to make your way, huh? Utah. You just got your 30-day coin. How do you feel? I don't know, I guess I'm... I'm scared. Scared of what? To feel. You know, the one question I keep asking myself... "Why should I?" On the one hand, I've been given this fresh start to be or do anything I want. And, on the other, it scares the shit out of me. I don't know who this me is. This new me without the drugs. I'm with this dude all day long, and I know nothing about him. Utah. - Hey. - Hey. Do you mind coming with me to intake? Sure. Opal. When'd you get here? A few hours ago. This is good. I have to get her admitted, but I'll get you a pass so you can come visit tomorrow. Okay. Now, you do whatever she says. I'll come by tomorrow. Great. - Hey. - Hey. I'm May. Hey, May. I just need to get a little information from you and then we can get you into your room, okay? Okay. Opal, what's your drug of choice? So, uh, you see your girl in there? Yeah. What happened? I told you she would come around, man. Man, I never thought she would. So goddamn stubborn. We all are in the beginning. - What's that? - Your cut. - My cut? - Yeah. My cut for what? Well, technically, she is your referral. That's your half of the money. Nah, I'm just happy she's here, I didn't, uh... I didn't do it for no money. - You sure? - Yeah. I'm cool, man. All right. I get it. No problem. How about I just hold on to it in case you change your mind? - Yeah? - Yeah. Be right here. So, uh... I don't know, I was thinking about getting you a day pass for this weekend. Thought maybe we could chill. - Sounds good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - All right. I'll let you know. How are you? I know. The first three days are the worst. They got you on the meds? Yeah. - Yeah, I just took them. - Good. Probably made a fucking mistake, though. Yeah, I know it seems that way, but... just hang in there. Um, we're not together, you know. I know, but... I was thinking... you know, with a little bit of time, and once you're better, that we can be. I'm only gonna be here for a minute. I got into some trouble... back home, and when that shit blows over, I'm going back. What kind of trouble? I hit a pharmacy and someone got hurt. What do you mean? Just fucking hurt. No one got killed or nothing, stupid. Who did you do it with? - Rooster. - With Rooster? - What, like, Skinhead Rooster? - Yeah. What are you doing hanging out with those douchebags? Well, you left. And I needed a partner. Guess I should tell you... he and I are together now. He's laying low at his cousin's in Michigan and I came out here. - Man! - What was I supposed to do? Wait for you? You left me. You ran like a fucking pussy. You're doing that thousand-yard gaze, man. Shit is creepy as hell. So what's the deal with you, man? What? I get you a day pass for the weekend. We supposed to be chilling. Hey, man, do you still have that money? Yeah. Why? I'm thinking I'll take it. Boy, I've never seen anyone look so miserable counting money. Hell's wrong with you? Look around. We're in California, boy. This is the Mecca of beautiful people. You hung up over one? I can't shake it. Well, you need to get the fuck over her, bro. You got a pocket full of money, ocean breeze blowing through your hair. You know what I mean, come look around, man. Life could be good if you'd just let it happen. So is this, uh... Is this what you do, then? I didn't buy that car by doing charity work, if that's what you're asking. Hey, man, how can I get in? You serious? Yeah. You sure you ready to leave treatment? I think so. You think so. I don't fuck with fiends, Utah. I run a tight ship, baby. Man, I'm done with that shit. But you're sure, now? You sure? Because, I mean, listen, a lot of what I do is not pretty. Now, if you've got a weak stomach, it's okay. I know a lot of people at food and beverage could get you a job. Man, I cannot work a nine-to-five. Me neither. You listen to me, you ain't gonna never have to worry about money a day in your life. But if you fuck up... I don't know you. Where's my phone? I don't expect anything I'm saying to change your mind, but... you don't have to go yet. Mmm? I mean, there's a lot of work still to be done. I feel like I'm good. A lot of people leave here thinking that and some are lucky enough to make it back but most aren't. I... I understand that. But really, Dr. White, I'm gonna be okay. Sobriety is a long, slow process, and... I'm still working on it every day. Hmm? You understand what I'm saying, Utah? Yeah, I do. You take care out there. What is this? This is day one. - Hey, Polly. - Hey. I'd like you to meet the new kid. - Hey new kid. - Hey. Ain't no phone calls? No, uh, Vin said same time and place this afternoon. Do you guys need anything? - Need anything? - I'm cool. Yeah, we're cool. Just gonna give him a tour. Okay. Great. Nice to meet you. You, too. Sounds like a fucking symphony, doesn't it? What is it? This... is the American fucking dream. Jacko? Sup, baby? Who's this squib? This is Utah. Utah. How much time you got? I... I just picked up my 30. Ah! Freshie. I just picked up my nine months. Stick with the winners, huh? Hey. Hey, I wanna show him a phone call. A call? And you brought him to the king. All right. Jacko don't play. All right. What do we got? Uh... West Virginia. Hmm? Let's do it. Got you, baby. All right, Miss Thomas, your ass is mine. All right. ♪ West Virginia, Mountain Momma ♪ Take me home ♪ Hello. This is Jackson with the Addiction Services Center. How may I help you today? Of course. No, feel free. I'm happy to help. So, you see those commercials on television? You know the ones with the Rick-Moranis-looking dude, talking about, uh, "Are you or one of your family members struggling with addiction?" Bullshit commercials in the middle of the night. - Exactly. Those are ours. - Right? Isn't that expensive? We're not running them during the Super Bowl... That's not a bad idea. I struggled with the same problem. Anyway, we run them where and when addicts are at. At night, in targeted states. Ohio, West Virginia, Oklahoma. New Jersey's a good one. Well, ma'am, let me ask you this. Do you know what your son's been using, and for how long? Mmm-Hmm. Right. Well, in that case, he's definitely gonna need detox. Um... Do you have insurance by any chance? That's great. I'm gonna place you on a brief hold, and let me just check something on my end. Husband's in the union. Booyah! Now, see, union workers usually have great insurance, which means they pay most of the treatment center's bills. Uh, she's on hold. He's not worried she's gonna hang up or... She ain't hanging up. We're saving her baby. Look, we're in the placement business. Now, what he's doing is checking to see which treatment center will kick out the most for the kid. We field the calls, sell to the highest bidder. - Get it? - Yeah. All right, handsome. Sea Breeze says 9 Gs. Take it. Ma'am, I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting, but I have some good news. I made a few calls, called in a favor, actually, and we have your son a bed at one of our facilities. - Th... That's it. - That's it. He just made 9 grand in 3 minutes, Sign me up. Where do I start? No, no, no. Start? No, no, no. - You ain't working here with these idiots. - Miracles do happen. That's your people. God is great. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. - Hey, Tee. How you doing, baby? - Good. Utah, this is Miss Tee. I see, he's a cutie. You boys want anything to drink? Coffee? No, ma'am, I'm fine. Thank you. I'm all right. Thanks. All right. I'll go get him. What the fuck is this place, man? Hey, just be cool, bro. We're at work. Dave? Looking mighty rough there, bro. Ready to go back? I think I need another day or two. That's not how this works, you know that. But I have... I have some money left. How much? Maybe $60. All right, I tell you what. I'ma give you till tomorrow, is that okay? Sure. This time... can we make it in 3 Gs? Two. Nice try, though. Someone will be by to pick you up tomorrow, okay? - Okay. - All right. - Thanks, Wood. - You got it. Yeah. Show me. Come over here. Oh, I love you so... Remember Sid? I'm Sid. He ain't getting better anytime soon. He's what we call a lifer. Lives off the rehab shuffle. Does his 90 days, hits the street for a few weeks, then comes right back for another 90. He's a living, breathing ATM machine. That's the type you have to keep close. You can't let them get away. Woody... Junior. Hey. Count out 2 grand for me. Who's your friend? Oh, this is my girl. This is Penny. Uh, she says she needs a little help. I thought I could bring her to you. You know, she knows the whole deal. Utah, you guys... They know each other, so I mean, she's good, Hey, Pen. Hello. So, Penny, you've ever been to treatment before? Yeah, I just got out. Did nine months. She wasn't even being paid. I mean, can you believe that? That's criminal, baby. But you do understand that you have to complete the whole 30 days, right? I mean, you don't get paid if you leave early. Wait, I can't get something now? Babe? I got you, baby. Come on, Sid's got you. No, I mean, I told her what the deal was. So do you have a spot for her or not? Yeah. Don't spend it all in one place, Sid. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh... You forgot something. Not until she's admitted. Right. All right. Okay. Baby, you just hang in there, okay? And you're gonna give them your information. And I'm gonna go get us a little something special, okay? - Okay. - Okay. See you around. So, um, you have insurance, sweetheart? Yeah. You know which provider? Um... Let me see. Here it is. HT Platinum. Mmm. Fucking gold mine. It's gonna be just fine. Thank you. Man, you gonna tell me what that was? That was good business. So they go to treatment for 30 days... you get the kickback, and then they get a piece? That's capitalism, baby. Some people need motivation. I mean, you don't care what they do with the money? Not my business. Because when they run out... they go back in. Wow. And the house is yours. How many people? With a place like New West where you was at, about 70%. Some places, maybe more. Does New West know? - Vin! - My man. Utah, Vin. Vin, Utah. Utah. Slide in, bro? How you doing? I'm good. Wood here keeping an eye on you? Yeah, so far. He says we can trust you, Utah. Can we trust you? Yeah. That's for the last two weeks. What we got here? Ooh-wee! Wee! Hey, man what's this I'm hearing about some kid from West Virginia being sent over to Sea Breeze? What's that? Who told you that? All right. All right. All right. Full disclosure. Your man said six, they offered nine. Come on, Vin, I run a business here, man. - You know how it is. - You run a business. - Yeah. You understand. - You're all about the money. I mean... End of the day. I run a business. It's when you pick up the phone and you call me, man. It's called a negotiation. Remember that. - All right. - All right? - Touche. My bad. - Okay. We still good for next week, though, right? Solid. Sure? - All right. Come on, kid. - Hold on, hold on, hold on. You remember the thing in Tustin? Yeah. It's back. I thought after Orange County we were done with that. What happened in Orange County? They got greedy, is what happened. You see, a few years ago Naltrexone implants became the go-to treatment for opiate addiction. These implants block the opiate receptors in the brain, thus preventing the ability to use opiates. Now, what some people have begun doing is performing these implants on anyone they can find. Clients at the treatment centers, maybe even incentivizing or paying someone who isn't an opiate addict to get the procedure done. Each one of these implants pays out $60,000. Most doctors can churn out 20 implants a day. Do the math. Lot of money floating around. Okay? The heat's off. It's time to go back to work. All right. I've got an address. You be there at noon tomorrow. - Same money? - Same. Everything's the same. Why don't you take the kid here, man? Give him some lunch money. Maybe a haircut. Yeah, definitely a haircut. All right, let's go. Hey, Wood. The shit with Sea Breeze, man, I don't wanna ever hear that shit again. Okay? - All right. All right. - All right? We're partners, man. My word, Vin. Utah. Welcome to the team. - Later, Vin. - See you, man. See ya. Oh, shit. Yeah. Crazy, right? Just think, eight years ago I was homeless. All right, man, come on. Let me show you the best part. So, that's your room over there. I mean, you know I could just sleep on the couch, right? I don't want your Cajun ass dirtying up my couch. That's yours until you get on your feet. - You sure? - Yes, I'm sure. You know, people like us, we don't get too many opportunities, to be honest, Utah. These people? Shit. They're going to get high regardless. I just provide a service. Place some bodies, you know. Don't worry about all of that. You get some rest, okay? Unpack. Talk to you in the morning. What's up, Doc? Oh, you got to be Wood, right? Yes, I am. - This is Utah. - Utah. So why don't we, uh... Why don't we cut to the chase? Okay? I, uh... Tuesdays and Thursday mornings. Mornings are the best for me. And if we have overflow, which hopefully we will, we go to my office in Torrance. How many can you manage in a day? Twenty, give or take one or two. Depending on complications or whatever, yeah. Listen, it's... it's a relatively simple procedure. You cut right here. Okay, and... I'm sorry. And then... and then you put the implant in. It's... it's... It's 101 shit. Yeah. Okay. All right. And, um, the billing? Billing. We bill for abdominal surgery, and that's 60 grand an implant, okay? And they come like clockwork. So we're good. Speaking of billing, this arrangement that we have it's going to be a 50-50 split, right? Yeah. Straight down the middle. Okay, good. So, 50-50. Yeah. Oh, one last thing. What about the removals? Yeah. Get them coming and going, right? Let's make some fucking money. Make some money. Utah? Hey! - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - How are you? - Good. It's so crazy to see you... here. - Yeah. - Um, I... You okay? You look kinda lost. I'm good. Yeah, I am lost. Um... Just got a new place. So I'm, uh, trying to get the basics, I guess. - You want some help? - That'd be great. Okay. I got you. Come on. Um... So it's like brand, brand-new? Oh, yeah. So you need one of everything? - I guess. - Yeah, okay. What else? Have you been working? Yeah, I found a job. Really? That's awesome. Stayin' sober? Coming up on my 90 days. Utah... That's fucking amazing. Good for you. What meetings have you been going to? Meetings. Oh, so you have willpower, huh? Nah, I haven't really had the urge yet. - So that's good, right? - Yeah. Well, you're stronger than me. I need a program or I'm fucked. Uh, okay. I'm sold. - Yeah? - Yeah. - It looks like you. - It's great. I think it's gonna be great. It was really good to see you. Maybe I'll see you around. Wait. May, um... Maybe you wanna... meet up sometime? Um... I'm actually not supposed to see clients until they've been out for two years. You know, it's kind of the law. And, uh... You know, if we had to run into each other again, like... I don't know, on accident? Well... I mean, if it was an accident then I'd have plausible deniability. I mean, couldn't really be prosecuted for that. Maybe it'll happen then. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe somewhere like 3rd & Colorado tomorrow night at 7:00 p.m. Maybe somewhere like that. Don't forget your broom. Yeah, boy, this is the life, huh? It's good. Utah! What's up, homie? What's up? Come on and party with us, man. We waiting on you. Aw, man. I didn't bring my swim trunks.

Aah! Ooh! Yeah, man. All right, yo, let's go introduce you to some of these ladies. You know, what? I'm actually meeting a girl tonight. So I gotta stay on my game, if you know what I mean. Well, I'm proud of you, man. Look at you, bro. Ah, I'm fucking loving you, boy. - Man, all right, you good? - Yeah. All right. Talk to you later. I wanna thank y'all for comin' out here tonight. Now, I know that none of you sorry motherfuckers wanna listen to me bitch about my bullshit problems, so I'm gonna... try to take it easy on you tonight. Because tonight is a speaker meeting, and I have invited all the way from Long Beach... - You made it. - What is this? ...my good friend Wayne here to share his story with us. They have soup kitchen for hipsters? So let's give him a big welcome, shall we, please? Thank you. Thanks, Lee. I'm Wayne. I'm a 5'11'' junkie with a God complex. Hi, Wayne. Thanks to all of you, I have 10 years sober. I'm, uh, from the Midwest. Came in off the streets. My mother died of cancer. Never really... knew my father. And, uh, I wasn't always a drug addict, but... I never felt like I belonged anywhere. Never really felt like my skin fit. After I found drugs and alcohol, all my insecurities just went away. Everything was in perfect harmony. Till it wasn't. All right, last thing we do at every meeting is we pass out chips to mark milestones in our recovery. So is there anyone here who's celebrating up to 90 days of their recovery tonight? - Raise your hand. - No. Boys and girls... Raise your hand, or else I'm gonna do it for you. Shut up. Shut up. Going once. Goin' twice. Yeah, we have a winner! How many days? - Ninety. - All right! Come on down. There you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Come on. There we go. Congratulations. Who are you? Oh, shit, uh... I'm Utah. I'm a... drug addict. - Say hi to Utah. - Hi, Utah. Um... 90 days. It's crazy. Uh, to be honest, when I walked in, I didn't really know what you people were about. But, Wayne... what you said... you told my story, man. And to see you up here with 10 years, and happy... Well, I can't really even fathom that. But it gives me hope, though. I guess I'm learning that I don't have to do this all alone, so... thank you all for that. All right, Utah. It's funny I can't really picture you doing drugs, or drinking or, anything like that. Okay. You're quite normal. I don't even really know what normal is, but... Uh... I promise you I earned my seat. - Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah. Just because I have a nine-to-five, and I get paid to... - Oh, is it something important? - Work. Well, you can take it if you need to. - I'm sorry... - No, no, it... It's fine, really. - I gotta go... - Come on. I'll walk you out. Come on. Wait. - Is this your car? - Yeah. Marketing, huh? I had a really nice time tonight. And, um... Thank you for showing me that meeting, that was... surprisingly cool. Well, maybe I'll see you there sometime. Yeah. I, uh... I think you might. Um... - Okay, I see how it is. - Yeah. You know... Figured I'd give you one of those and... if you need any help you can... give me a call. Um... Yeah, if... If I have any friends who need a... marketer... I'll have them call you. Here you go, Tee Tee. I'm sorry I was late. Yeah, it's okay. There's a few waiting. Thanks, sweetie. Hey, Utah. What are you doing here? Wood didn't tell you? He's the one who got me out here. What do you mean? Shit. The day you called me... later that night, he gave me a call. Said he'd give me money to go to treatment. Figured you knew. Forgot to mention that. You gonna give me my money? Here. Why don't you stay for a bit. We could have some fun. Aah! - Don't fucking grab me. - You're high. Everyone here is fucking high. You fucking stupid? I got a guy who's gonna take it out for a few more bucks later. Why do you fuckin' care? The fuck? Is that the fuckin' cops, man? What the fuck? We better still be gettin' paid. This isn't good. Fuck! All right, everybody out. Man, fuck you! Get the fuck out! I'll find you. - So exactly what did you see, anyway? - I told you, man. Cops. What kinda cops? What? Undercover? SWAT? Sheriffs? What kind of fuckin' cops? The fuck if I know! Fuckin' cops. All right. I spoke to Vin, he gonna sort it all out. Man, what the fuck does that mean? Wait, wait, wait. You got something else you wanna say? Man, why didn't you tell me about Opal? What about her? You acted like she came out here on her own. Not that you fuckin' called her and fuckin' brokered her! That young bitch is a junkie, man. You don't know by now? What, you're also a dope dealer, too? She's over there coppin' from Miss Tee. She gonna get high regardless. Okay? Regardless. It might as well be me. You know what? My bad. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for ever pickin' your stupid ass up off the street! The clothes, the money, the cars, the house! Oh, and by the way, you can thank me later for nobody finding your stupid ass dead in a fuckin' hotel in Ohio. Get the fuck outta here, man! I saw something in you. I still see something in you, Utah. I mean, come on, man. Look around, bro. Look how we living. Me and you got more money than both our deadbeat dads ever had. We brothers. Me and you the same. What you wanna fight me for? Huh? Over that dumb bitch? She don't love you. Bro, we fam. It's me and you. Come here, man. Come here. Come on. Hey. I'ma call Vin. He gonna take care of all of this. - All right? - All right. Okay. Why are you guys here? Hey, yo, Doc, what the fuck happened, man? - What? About the nurse? - Yes. I spoke to Vin about that, okay? It was a nurse, she talked to a friend, complained she... No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Don't worry about talking to Vin, you talk to me. What happened, bro? I fired her. Okay? She's gone. She's probably illegal anyway. So we got nothing to worry about. So... so what are we supposed to do now? Answer me that. So what do we do now is you take junior here and get the fuck out, okay? And we just chill for a little bit, and we alternate between the Torrance office, that's all. This is what goes along with doing this business. All right. I will talk to Vin, see what he says. Yeah. And when you talk to Vin, and I've given this a lot of thought... It's a new arrangement. 70% for me, 30% for you guys. Excuse me? No, excuse me. I got a degree up on my fuckin' wall. All right? So I'm tired of playin' second fiddle to a... Seriously, two fuckin' junkies. So you can take that back to your fuckin' boss now. And stop showin' up here without an appointment. Man. Now, can you please leave my clinic? And take the retard Mongoloid with you, please. Come on, Junior, get the fuck up. Get up, kid, let's go. Fuck you! What happened? What the fuck did he do? I'm sorry, man, I fucked up. No, man. No, man, don't apologize. As long as you're okay. Just gotta be really smart about this now, man. You got a place to take him? Yeah. Yeah, I know a spot. - You know a spot? - Yeah. You got about five hours before the sun comes up. All right? When you finish with this, I want you to burn both your clothes. - Everything. - Okay. - All right? - Yeah. And once you're done, I want you to pack a bag and I want you to get the fuck out of here for a little bit. I'll call my guys tomorrow, and I'll see what's what. - Okay? - Yeah. What about the kid? He gonna be a problem? 'Cause he's the only one who saw you do this. Right? And he's the one who's been running the implants, right? - And he knows everything. - Look, I hear you. All right, I'll handle things on my end. You just make sure this body stays gone. - Okay? - Yeah. How are you doing, kid? - Cool. - You cool? I mean, did this fuck you up a little bit? Nah. I like this fucking kid. Utah, get in the car. We got somewhere we gotta be. See you later, Vin. You just relax, man. Be right back. Man, you think this is deep enough? Yeah, it's deep enough. You okay, man? Yeah, I'm good. Come on, let's bury this body. Burn these fucking clothes. I should have told you about Opal. I should've told you. You know she's gone, though, right? I mean... Just ain't no saving some people. Yeah, I know. Shouldn't have been doing that coke around you either. I can't have you going back. You got your whole life ahead of you. I never meant for none of that shit to happen, man. Yeah, I know. People like that... been talking down to me my whole life. He's no better than us. He's just a crook in a white coat. How the hell did I find you, man? That's adorable. Hey, is that... Is that who I think it is? You fucking dog. What are you doing here? Meet me in the back. You never stop surprising me. One day you got to let me know how that was. I mean, she's a bit natural for me, but I'm still curious. Yeah. How long's Wood letting you stay here? He says as long as I need to. He's a good guy. How are you doing? I'm all right. Yeah? You sure? You know, Wood said you handled yourself real well. Hey, hey, hey, hey, man. That's good. That's good. There's not a lot of people that, uh... can make something of themselves, you know? You got that. You got that thing, man. You hear me? Yeah. You didn't say shit to her about anything, did you? Man, you think I'm stupid? No, I don't think you're stupid, man. You're anything but stupid. She shouldn't even know I was here. That's... That's the truth. Why are you here? I just want to make sure you're being careful. What... What does that mean? Well, it means I think you should take a trip, you know, - for like, a week or so until I get... I get... - No. No... No, listen to me. Listen. Hey, hey, hey. Until I get a handle on this shit, make sure it blows over. You cool? What? What? What? Is it her? She's not going anywhere. She not going anywhere, man. Just... You just tell her you gotta go and take care of some bullshit business at home for a while, all right? Hey, look at me. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. She is not going anywhere, I promise you that. Wood already left earlier, okay? I just think this is a smart thing to do. It is. It's a smart thing to do. And you two could... You could... You could have sex on FaceTime or whatever the fuck you guys do. - She'll love it. She'll love it. - All right, all right. All right? You're family, man. You are family. I'm gonna take care of you. You understand that? Okay? Now I'm gonna take off. I'm gonna send somebody by here later. And you need to be gone. You understand me? I need you gone. - Okay. - All right. - All right. - I'm gonna call you later. - I'll stay in touch. - Okay. All right? All right? Sexting, man, sexting. Where are you going? I got to... I got to leave for a few days. Is everything okay? Yeah. Just, uh, work stuff. What's going on in that head? Well... maybe you'll tell me when you get back. I'm gonna miss you. I forgot to give you this. Well, I didn't really need it back. I mean, this thing is, like, ancient. You're laughing. But it saved me when I was in there. Oh, yeah? Well, good, because you definitely needed saving. Not anymore. Oh, yeah? Why's that? Because I've got you now. My savior. Stupid. - Come back soon, okay? - Okay. - How you doing, hon? - Fine. Can I help you? A pack of lights, please. Who's that? My niece. Leukemia. I don't know why God lets these things happen. I don't know. I hope it helps. Hey. How are you doing? I'm all right. I haven't... I haven't really felt right since I've been back. It's been rough. You ready to come back to work? I think so. Good. That's what I wanna hear. I got someone for you to pick up out there. Get him on a plane, and I'll pick you guys up tonight. All right. Just text me the address. Will do. Be safe, you. Before we go in... do you have anything on you I need to know about? Yeah. Well, you better do it now, because this is it. I guess the real question is this... How do you end a never ending story? That's for you all to decide. But you'll never do a goddamn thing about it. So, until then, if you or a loved one is struggling with addiction... give me a call.
