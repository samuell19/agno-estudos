Berlin, February 1933 You're good at that, huh? Scaring a handful of little Chinese girls. Why are you under the table? The Nazis are after me. The Nazis? Hello there, Max. Aren't you a bit old to be Zorro? At least it's a costume. Unlike you! - Well, that's your opinion. - Idiot. Hey, give my rabbit back! Catch! Max, you show him! Finish him off! You show it to him, Max! Go on! Based on the novel by Judith kerr when Hitler stole pink rabbit - We don't give to beggars. - You heartless person! Have you no pity for a poor beggar child? - And a hungry Zorro? - Not straight into the living room. Come on, take off your wet things. Max knocked them all down. The cowboys, the Indians... And the Nazis. - Yes! - That was great, Max. I'm glad you had fun. Here we go. How did you both get so soaking wet? We went down the sledding hill. - Put on something warm. It's on the bed. - Okay. - You have cheeks like an old dog. - Well, thank you. Did the doctor come again? He said your father needs to stay in bed three more days. He has to take it easy and he's not allowed to work or go to the theater. What are you doing? - The sausages will drown. - Their time is up anyhow. Erich and Otto didn't dress up at all. They just came as Nazis. They're just as dumb as their parents. Anna, don't be so cheeky. - How was carnival? - Good. Why eat in here? - It's cozy in here with heimpi. - That's true. Are you going to another concert? Yes. Miss fischer is singing schubert. She's about to pick me up. Max, your vocabulary book is lying untouched on the desk. After dinner, you study. - Annuntio vobis gaudium: Habemus papam. - What's that? - "We have a pope.” - You're crazy. Dorothea kemper. Yes, speaking. - Mama? - Who am I talking to? Be quiet and finish that mountain of potato. Silentium. Favete linguis. Fighting the Jew means removing the Jew! Are you crazy? We're socialists, not Nazis. And we're Jews ourselves. Then you must be removed! Get lost! I have to study. You... spoilsport. Heimpi? - They have no right. - Mama? You're not... - Out! Close the door. - But I... - I said get out! Now! - Come back later, honey. It looked bad. I think mama was crying. No way. Mama never cries. Maybe she was peeling onions. Sure, she was peeling onions. Our mother! Wearing an evening gown. Out you come, Anna. It must be cold in there by now. In literature and theater, evil has many faces... - Papa, are you awake? - Goethe's devil Rose from... Come here, sweetheart. He was the dreadful phantom of the unsuspecting... Not too close. I'm contagious. Mephisto was at least a gentleman. He came in person to ask faust for his soul. Today the devil just sends his servants. Foul and corrupt, with blood-stained hands, screaming and full of rhetoric, it demands Germany's soul. Is that you on the radio? Yes. But you don't have to whisper. I know what I said last week. I will vote no against evil. How was carnival? So should you. Great! I was a beggar girl. It was very exciting. The donuts taste better when you're poor. That's true. What's that? A shipwreck. A shipwreck? Mrs. funk told me to draw something nice. Do you want to draw something nice? It's like a curse. I can't think of anything but disasters. This is the best shipwreck anyone ever drew. You did a really good job. It's not bad to draw such gloomy things? If you want to draw a disaster, you should. There's no point drawing what others expect. That won't work. Max captured this at the party. In ancient times, the swastika was a good luck symbol. Now it's reduced to a symbol of stupidity. Throw it away. Anna, you'll get sick too. - I'm so scared sometimes, papa. - Are you? What are you scared of? Of the fog and of the pin. And mama was crying just now. You'll get infected, honey. No, I'll never get sick. Heimpi takes care of me. When you're sick, you need a lot of love. Love is the best medicine in the world. Hallelujah. You're a very melodramatic little person. Damn! All the snow has gone. Papa. Papa! Heimpi! Where is papa? Anna! - Did papa die? - No. Max, you listen too. What I'm about to say is very important. We had a phone call yesterday. A man warned your father. A man from the police. - That's why you didn't go out. - Exactly. There are lots of Nazis in the police, but this man isn't one. He knows papa and he likes him because of his newspaper articles and his books. He called to tell us that papa's name is on a list. What list? If Hitler wins the election ten days from now, he'll try to silence those who are against him. The man said that papa's passport would be taken and that he should leave Germany now, while he still can. Leave? But we live here. And papa has the flu. He was feeling much better this morning. Papa is taking that man's concerns very seriously. So very early this morning he went to Prague, czechoslovakia. How does Hitler know papa can't stand him? Everyone knows. He states his opinion very clearly in the paper. And he says it on the radio. And now? “We'll wait for the elections. If Hitler wins... We'll go to meet papa in Prague. And if he loses, papa will come back home. But I don't want to leave! Neither do I. But listen. Nobody, absolutely nobody, can know that papa has left Germany. That's very important. You mustn't tell anybody. - What about Gunther and oli? - And elsbeth? Absolutely not. Nobody! I'm Jewish too. - Since when? - Since forever. Really? I had no idea. Me neither. But your nose isn't even... - Elsbeth, not every... - Anna? Is your father still sick? - Yes, he has the flu. - He's had that for a very long time. That's strange, isn't it? How high is his fever? I have to go home. My mother is waiting. Give him my best wishes! Yes. Tell him I miss his articles in the paper... Those mean articles! Anna! Mama. Yes? Mrs. lambeck was outside... - Hello, sweetheart. - Hello. - Uncle Julius! - Anna. - Why are you here? Don't you have work? - Not today. Are you eating with us? I can't, I'm afraid. I stopped by to talk to your mother. I brought you this. It's beautiful, thank you. How are the elephants in the zoo? Wonderful. They don't care about Hitler. They're just happy spring is coming so they can get back outside. Anna, your coat. It's about time we visited the little one. I bet he's all grown up now. Blow here. Thank you. Can Gunther eat with us? He knows papa is sick. No, papa needs absolute rest. I'm sorry, Gunther. That's all right. - See you tomorrow, Max. - Bye. Your father has arrived in Prague. Uncle Julius met him there. He doesn't want us to stay here any longer. - We'll meet him in Switzerland tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Heimpi? Would you like this? - But... - I can't take all of this stuff. - But this isn't right. - Of course it is. He's worried they'll take our passports. We're his family and we're Jews. - But not proper ones. - Exactly. - What about school? - And heimpi? I'll take care of the house until we all know what's going on. If the Nazis win, then you'll come and join us. You're packing all this for no reason. Two weeks from now, we'll all be visiting the zoo again. Julius, those are first editions. Some are signed. Can you take them? - I'll guard them with my life. - Thank you. - If Hitler wins, when will we come back? - Nobody knows. - Maybe in a month, maybe two or three. - Three months? No school for three months? I don't know yet! The most important thing is that we don't argue. Secondly, we have to pack. Two books and one toy, and that's it. And thirdly, don't get sick. And I'll say this again. We're not telling anybody our plan. You both have a secret to keep now. That's a very grownup thing. This is tough. I love all of you. If I take Terri, the rabbit will be sad. And if I take the rabbit, Terri will be sad. They're stuffed animals, they don't have feelings. It's a shame we can't take the board games. I only just got them this Christmas. I got Terri this Christmas too. - Then take it with you. - But I've had the rabbit for so long. You're too old for stuffed animals anyway. Leave your drawing pencils here and you could take both. No way! All right, Anna, lights out. I can't choose, heimpi. I love them both. If I leave one behind, they won't understand. Listen to me. After you leave tomorrow, I'll pack another suitcase, an extra one. I'll put your rabbit in there and some nice books and the board games. When I know where you are, I'll send it to you. All right? You could just bring it with you when you come. Say it, heimpi. Good night, dear Anna. Good night, dear Max. Sleep well, sweet dreams and goodbye until tomorrow. Goodbye, heimpi. Goodbye, heimpi. It's a bit unfair that you can take your whole huge opera and we're only allowed one toy. Nothing is unfair. I worked on that opera for two years. Go and get dressed. Goodbye, office. Goodbye, round dining table. Goodbye, grand piano! Goodbye, dear heimpi kitchen. Goodbye, lovely old house. Where is he? Heimpi, could you take a look in the house? - Yes. - Thanks. Good morning! Off on a trip? So early in the morning? My husband is so sick that I'm sending the kids to stay with family. Then he won't be able to vote on Sunday. No, I don't think he will. - Morning, Mrs. lambeck. - Morning, Max. - Where have you been? - I had to say bye to Gunther. You what? Unbelievable. Come on, get in. See you soon, miss heimpel. See you soon, Mrs. kemper. Take care. Go on, get in. For going to sleep. Heimpi. Anna. Max. 143, 144, 145... 146... 147. - What are you counting? - The pylons. 149. Since leipzig there have been 150... Couldn't think of anything more stupid? I have nothing left to read. I finished everything. "Famous people". You both must stay very quiet at the Swiss border. - Why? - Do you promise? If they ask, say we're vacationing for a few days. - But we're... - No buts! I have a strange feeling. Don't worry. Keep your mouth shut and we'll be okay. It seems like every famous person had a very difficult childhood. I fear that we won't ever be famous. I et's wait and see. Papa! Everything's okay, honey. We're nearly at the border. Good morning. Passports, please. Max. - Morning. - Where are you headed? To Zurich. We're visiting relatives. Don't you have school? Somebody passed away. Kemper. Kemper. The name is familiar to me. Where do I know it from? I don't know. It's not an unusual name. Yes, it is. I'll be wracking my brains all day. Have a good trip, madame. Goodbye. Max, please get me a towel. Passports, please. - Morning. - Good morning. Thank you. Young lady? Can I see your face? You look a little feverish. I have a cold. We say "the sniffles" here. - Welcome to Switzerland, madame. - Thank you. Thank you. You're burning up. I was so scared. I know. Max. Golden swan hotel, hello. Hello. This is my wife. Welcome, Mrs. kemper. Look. We can send this to heimpi. Mama? - I'm so thirsty... - Honey! Anna? What is it? Anna”? Young lady? Can you hear me? She's in a bad way. Her temperature is over 104. That can lead to inflammation of the brain. - Where can I get it? - One pharmacy is open until midnight. - Is it far? - No. Arthur. Heimpi must come. So, Anna? What's wrong? Heimpi. Blow, Anna. Hey, little man. Are you awake? My throat hurts. The national socialists have won 288 seats. Just like I said, 43.9 percent. Hitler will form a coalition. The Germans have lost their minds. So what do we do now? Aren't we going back to Berlin? That's way too cold! You're back! I'm hungry. You can have anything you want. Anything at all. Anything! My love. Now I'm glad that you didn't die. Was there an elephant in this room recently? Yes, there was. He sat in the chair reading to you. Don't you remember? Strange. It seemed so real. Are you strong enough for another little trip? Where are we going now? We have to move. This hotel is too expensive. So we're not going home yet? Nope. Hitler didn't win the election, but he got a majority. - We can't go back yet. - We're going to the countryside. Mom, they're here! They're here! Welcome to the zwirn guesthouse. Hello there. Hello. I'm Franz. Hello. I'm vreneli. This is my little sister, Trudi. Hello. It's empty now, but in summer the guests mostly sit outside. The lights are on then. - In the summer I'll go swimming. - If you ever learn how, you dummy! You'll join my class at school tomorrow, won't you? Max will go to high school in sils with Franz. Watch out, it's hot. Yummy. Got everything you need? Potatoes, beer? Pickles? Enjoy your meal. It smells like old socks. Stop complaining and eat up. - But heimpi would... - Heimpi isn't here. This is Switzerland. If you carry on dreaming of Germany, you'll miss wonderful new things. Look, mama likes it. She loves it. It's silly that I took the dog. I miss my rabbit. Stop going on about your animals. We have other problems. We do? Like what? You're so immature sometimes. In Berlin I was more better in school than you. Not "more better". Your illness cost us a pretty penny. We were in that expensive hotel for three weeks. I was sick for three weeks? Yes, you were. The doctor wasn't cheap either. What day is it today? - What's that? - A calendar. I'll cross the days off one by one until we go home. Then have fun drawing crosses. Mama said three months... If papa can't sell articles, you'll end up in a home. You liar! I hope they have something other than melted cheese. This is Anna from Germany. The refugee. She's in our class now. Welcome, Anna. Now, listen to me. Anna is from Germany and doesn't understand our language. We will all have to talk very slowly and clearly. I'm Mr. graupe. I'm from rapperswil. And you? Hello. Berlin. You can sit at the back next to rosi. Quiet! How is she meant to know? Ready? We're going to yodel again. What did I do wrong? Only boys are allowed to walk down the middle. Girls walk down the side. Arthur! Careful! Not so fast. It's a piece of cake! So is Chinese when you can speak it. - At home papa knew how to do everything. - Hey! Those days are over. Uncle Julius? Uncle Julius! What are you doing here? I was at a conference in bolzano and thought I'd drop by! They came one day after the election, as you predicted. They wanted to confiscate your passports. But heimpi was brave. She said she didn't know where you were, and she chased them off. Good old heimpi. You saw heimpi? Is she well? Yes. She asked me to help her. With what? Last Tuesday they came with a truck and picked up your things. What? The piano too? They took it all. The big brown suitcase? I don't know, but they took everything and said it will be in storage until you return. All I have is the box of first editions. At least you have that. That's good. - I can sell them for you if you want. - No way. Never. Could you go and get the suitcase? - It has toys inside. We need them! - This isn't about your toys. My rabbit was in that suitcase. They burned your books too, you know. Burned by that filthy mob? I take that as a compliment. Would you like a piece? Thanks. I like Terri. He's much prettier than that old rabbit. Maybe Hitler is playing one of my board games right now. I hope he's nice to my rabbit. Tucholsky has been silent since the book burning. I think he's depressed in exile. The Nazis revoked his citizenship. He's not coming back. Can you write here? Yes. That's not the problem. It's just difficult to publish my work. Why? Switzerland worries that publishing a critic of the Nazis would make them lose their neutrality. And I think they're scared themselves. They think their little country has got too many Jewish intellectuals. Are you making enough money? I'll try and change the publishers' minds. - Can I touch her? - She's afraid of strangers. You have to be careful. No fast movements. You're safe here. - That's the main thing. - I'm not sure. Maybe I shouldn't have left. Germany needs our voices. Are you joking? Remember professor teitelbaum? They took him from the university straight to the camp. Those swines put him in a dog kennel, attached to an iron chain. He had to crawl on all fours and eat his food out of a dog bowl. He slept chained up on the floor of a wooden hut. He had to bark every time someone went in or out of the camp or they'd beat him with sticks. The chain was so short that he couldn't stand. He took his own life after two months. There's a small, warm light burning in your heart, Anna. Protect it. Don't let it be extinguished by anyone or anything. We have to keep believing in good. That's important. Good will always win. Can you blow this open for me again? I don't believe it anymore. You're pressing the button. Oh. I have to go. Julius, take care. Chop-chop. Off to bed. Thank you. Sleep well, sweet dreams and goodbye until tomorrow. Good night. Night. Michel, what did I tell you? - What are you looking at? - Nothing. I'm just looking. Look at that. Reto can't do it at all. - Can't do what? - Cartwheels. - Even I can do them better. - Who cares? Boys are dummies anyway. You need more power. You have to stretch your legs like this. Got it? Yes. It's easy. You can do it. Just don't forget your legs. "You need more power"! There you go! Vreneli, what's up? You know full well. I don't! Please tell me. One thing is for sure. Everyone saw your underwear. You are the dummies now. They're coming! What was that? Just keep going. What are you doing? Anna, stop it. Come on, Anna. I'm warning you now. If you throw all of those... Help! Mama! Mama, help! - Mamal! - What's going on? What is all this? Reto! What's going on? No! Reto! I won't let you go until you tell me. Out with it! Tell me! - This is just what we do. - What's that? Throw stones at people? Because we love her. We did it because we love her! What? Because they love you. When they love someone they throw things at them. You should feel honored. - Okay, then. - If that's what you do here. Watch out, something's coming! Thanks, vrenel. For what? Being my friend. We're happy you were born and that it's your birthday today we love you and give you gifts food and fun and games we're happy that you were born and that it's your birthday today "Dear Anna, Theodor and I wish you a very happy and sunny day." "The elephant baby isn't a baby anymore, but more like an elementary schooler." "Best wishes to aunt Alice, from uncle Julius." - Who is aunt Alice? - He probably means me. He didn't write my name because of the Nazis. Thank you! It's lovely. I'll put it with uncle Julius' elephant. When I was ten, I got a bike. Better days will come. We're going on a steamboat tour on lake Zurich this afternoon. Really? Yes. It's organized by the Swiss literary society. I see. - Will there be other kids? - Unlikely. There'll be journalists and publishers. It could be important for us. Anna, come quickly! Someone from Germany is on the phone. For me? Yes. Hello? Anna, is that you? Heimpi! Anna, I wish you the most wonderful birthday. Heimpi, I'm ten now! I know, my dear. That's really and truly incredible. But you don't have to shout. I'm not your little Anna anymore. No. You're ten now. Are you all doing well? Get out of here. Go. We're eating cake. Ask how she got the number. Papa got me a goat. A goat? Do you have a garden? Where did you get our number? From Mr. Julius. He gave it to me. Switzerland is beautiful, heimpi. Please come soon! I can't, my sweet child. I've got a new job with another family. Take care of yourselves, all right? Heimpi, say something. - The 20 pfennig is nearly gone. - We're taking a steamboat on the lake! Really? - Hello, Mrs. heimpel. - Hello from us. - Let me talk to heimpi. - Has your mother learned to cook? Boys and girls are separated at school. Everything's different than Berlin. Anna... Even though you're ten now, you'll always be my little girl. I will never forget Max and... Now she's gone. And she found a new family. You've invited me here to talk as a writer and theater critic, Nobody goes into exile for fun. You love the place where you were a child, the people and the language. I always thought it was absurd to be a critic, if criticize was all you ever did. A year ago, German theater was blossoming, varied and rich. Today it is wanting, distorted and hollow. It is my job to assess its current state, even from my place in exile. My radio addresses and new writings are met with hatred in Germany. But I can't stop myself from thinking. This must be the most boring birthday you ever had. In Berlin my friends would be visiting. And heimpi would make strawberry cake. Did you at least sell an article? It doesn't work that fast, Anna. But I had a few good talks. Know what? You're not ten years old yet. Why not? You were born at 6:05 on June 14th 1923 in charlottenburg hospital. I was at the tavern next door sharing meatballs with your brother Max. We were very nervous. The tavern next door? Max was only three then. I never imagined your tenth birthday would be on a boat in Switzerland. Isn't it dangerous to keep criticizing Hitler? The Nazis could find us here too. I don't want to be fearful, Anna. And anyway, we're already on the run. Don't you mind being a refugee? I do. But I find it interesting too. Who knows where we'll be when you're 11. Or when you're 127 at home? I can't earn any money here. The Swiss won't give me work. I think we'll have to move on to another country. - Where? - Maybe Paris. There's a Jewish paper I could write for. Paris? Max and I would have to learn French. So what? You've a clever head on your shoulders. I don't think I've got used to being a refugee. Am I ten now? Yes. It's exactly 6:05. At least it means that Max and I can be famous one day. We'll certainly have a difficult childhood now. See? There's good in everything. - Can you manage ten days alone? - Sure. Right, little man? If we like Paris and find an apartment, we might come back earlier. Tonight we're having rosti with sausages. Listen to Mrs. zwirn and do what she says. She'll come in and turn out the lights at night. And you'll behave yourselves, okay? I'll write you a postcard every day. Thank you. While your mother and I are in Paris, you two will be representing our family in Switzerland. That's a big responsibility. Why? Because we Jews live scattered around the world and the Nazis are spreading terrible lies about us. So it's very important for people like us to prove that they are wrong. How do we do that? By being more honest than others, more hard-working, generous and polite. We have to show people that it's good to be Jewish. I'm sure that when we get back we'll be very proud of how you represented us. - Take good care of the hat, Anna. - I will. And you, Max, take good care of Anna. See you. - You're definitely coming back? - Of course we are! Don't forget to come and get us. Don't forget us! Anna, are you crazy? I'd never forget my children! Stop eating so much, vali. You're getting heavier. If I don't eat, I get dizzy. I'm dizzy already. Nearly there, vali. You can do it! Hey, no fighting! Hey, Anna. Your dad was in the paper today. Really? So he finally sold an article. No, it wasn't that. It said they're looking for him. Adolf Hitler has even put a price on his head. 1000 reichsmark. But don't worry. Hitler can't touch him here. He's safe here in Switzerland. Scared of the new school? Of the language maybe. But I managed to understand you. I speak German though. More or less. Those two over there are from Germany too. I know. But they don't play with me. They're Nazis. Is it bad to play with them? No. It's bad that they can go back to Berlin in two weeks and I can't. Wake up! “What is it? It's empty. It doesn't smell of anything anymore. No, Anna, I'm sorry. There was no postcard today. Nothing. We'll probably get three tomorrow. Write about your hike. They'll like that. Why put a price on someone's head, Max? “What? Mr. graupe said that Hitler had put a price on papa's head. It's when you promise someone a reward for finding someone else. We already knew Hitler's looking for him. Anyhow, I wish papa was here now. Good morning. I wish you all a wonderful day. Thank you. Come on. That was very brave. Think they realized you were teasing? I wasn't. I was trying to be extra polite. Go around. Go on! Go on! You can't get me. Yes, I will. Don't you worry. Help me! The thief is too fast! Go! Papa, I was so scared for your head! My head? Because Hitler put a price on it. I was a little worried about that too. Hello, you. Really? Yes. 1000 Mark is pretty cheap for someone like me, don't you think? I'm tempted to write Hitler a formal complaint. Where is mama? She's in Paris, fixing up our apartment. Our apartment? Yes. It has a balcony and a kitchen. I'll do the rest. It's too heavy. There's a whole cheese in there. - And sausages, bread and boiled eggs. - Thank you. - Something to drink on the road. - Thank you. Kids, get down. Take good care. You're always welcome here. Thank you, Mrs. zwirn. For everything. Goodbye. - Franz. - Goodbye. Where is Anna”? I'm sad that you're leaving. You're my best friend. Aren't you sad too? Yes, I am. But as a refugee you often say goodbye. It's part of my difficult childhood. Anna, come on! We have to go. Look what I've been practicing. Great, vreneli! Goodbye, narrow alleys. Goodbye, big rock. Goodbye, old watering hole. Goodbye, dummy! Bye, Anna. Look. It's the Eiffel Tower. The man who built it wasn't called eiffel, but bonickhausen. The French couldn't pronounce it so they called him eiffel, because he was from the eifel area. They can't pronounce that either. I thought it was yellow. Why? - Because papa said it has a balcony. - So it had to be yellow? A nice color, at least. Press the button. Good evening, professor. Good evening. So... these are your kids? Yes, this is Max and Anna. How cute. Evening, little one. I bought you some candy. Come here, Fifi! Thanks. - You're welcome. - Thanks. Wait a moment. Please sign here. - What is it? - The authorization. - What authorization? - Mine, of course. So that everything is in order. Perfect. - Do we have an elevator? - Is that because we're rich now? Come on. - My darlings! - Mamal yes! - You're finally here! - I missed you so much. Mrs. zwirn gave us a whole chocolate cake to take with us. - Hello. - Hello, sir. Come on in. I wonder what it's like. This is your room, the yellow one. Yellow is such a nice, happy color. Why is it so dark in here? You have this nice little lamp. - It's not so bad. - Come into the living room. It's the kitchen too. Nice. - This is what you called a balcony? - Yes. For me, this is a balcony. - Who used to live here? - The servants. It's cozy. Is this your room, papa? Yes. This is my office. And the bathroom? The toilet is in the stairwell. We share it with the neighbor. I'll give you a bowl of warm water to wash with. Who is our neighbor? She's called grete. She's a girl from Austria. She's here to learn French. She's a little... strange, but she speaks German. Is she Jewish too? - The potatoes! - Unlikely. - Oh, no. - Where will you sleep? I'll show you something. Max, help me out. Take a hold and pull. Come on. And voila. A magic sofa! Watch out. There we go. - I burned everything. - It's okay. We have one more room than we did at the zwirns. I thought it would be nicer. Me too. I tried my best. But the stove here is hard to control. The egg tastes good. But the potatoes are a little dark. Burned. It doesn't matter. Try this. You can live wonderfully on cheese, baguette and wine. Baguette? It's French for "stick". Give me that. Hey, not too much. I think it's gone bad. - It's moldy already. - It's a Saint maure. Goats cheese rolled in ash. Every place we end up, there's old cheese. Seems so. I drink to our family and to our future in this city. Cheers. That sounded... very fluent. - Cheers. - Cheers. Can you swim in this river? Yes, but not here. The river is called the seine. Come on. Seine... hello... cheers. I already know these three words in French. We can't allow our reviews to harm emigrated German artists. Our reviews are serious but not scathing. We request you to be tactful. You were Berlin's most-feared critic. It's not in my interest to make life hard for my fellow Germans. I much prefer giving praise than giving scorn. Really? Would you be prepared to write for us once a week about the Parisian theater scene? I'd love to do even more. We'd like to give you more, but we can't afford it. Culture is a luxury now. Finally! - How was it? - Good. Papa has work. Really? - That's mine. - Can I have one too? Are we eating here? I'm hungry. One review a week for 15 francs. That's 60 francs a month. Can I get you anything? How will we live on that? No, thanks. We're going. Let your sister have some. - All we have at home is bread and... - Cheese. We'll get butter and eggs on the way home. Eggs again? Yes, eggs again. Come on, let's go. I left this half for you. - Max? - I need a new schoolbag, a French one. And long pants. - I see. - How was it with the other boys? No idea. I didn't understand a word all day. How can I make new friends when I don't speak this stupid language? The best way to learn a language is through the music. Stop it. You're embarrassing me. Come on. Anna, come! - Can't you stay on your side? - Why do you need so much space? I can't concentrate with you scribbling. - Then go somewhere else. - I have to study. - Draw your stupid pictures on the floor. - Max. It's unfair that Max can go to school and I can't. One private school is enough expense. Then I'll go to a non-private school. That's where very simple people send their kids. We're simple people too now. They don't even teach Latin there. We might be poor, but your education comes first. Now what? I have to concentrate. I wish I had a sister. I wish I didn't. Am I also too loud? It's okay. Can I stay with you for a while? Did you argue again? How are your disasters? Will they all die in the avalanche? I'm afraid so. Do you have time to go and ask the concierge for the mail? Anna, did you hear me? Yes, I did. I'm scared of the stairwell. I see. Okay, I'll come with you this time. But tomorrow you'll do it alone. Good. Come on. - Good day, miss grete. - Good day. Why is she always so strange? I don't know and I don't want to think about it. Did you find a job that's to your liking Mr. professor kemper? Yes, madame prune, I work for a Paris newspaper. You don't have to worry about the rent. Pleased to hear it. One of those immigrant papers, is it? Want an olive? - Lots of Jews find work there. - I hope so. Come on, Anna. Don't forget that the rent is due every week. - Fridays! - Got it. "Dear Anna, this lovely hare reminded me of your pink rabbit. How are you doing in the beautiful city of Paris? Did you already try snails in garlic butter? Aunt Alice gave me some smart advice a while ago. Sometimes I think that I should have taken it. Lots of love from uncle Julius." What advice? Can you really eat snails? He shouldn't have gone back to Germany. I kept telling him. I look terrible. My hair! Where are you going? Arthur, no! It's far too expensive! I don't want any. No! Arthur, come back. Stop it! - Done! - Really? All of the exercises? - Yes, yes. - I'll be right there. Excellent! - Hello, how can I help you? - Hello, madame. Pencil. I think "madame" is for a woman. That's right. Thank you. Pencil. Thanks. You're welcome. Two francs. Thank you very much. And... goodbye. Goodbye. There's nothing left? Mama said we could keep the change. - It doesn't matter. Come on. - It does matter! Cheap, cheap... Cheap! Cheap pencil? Thank you. Yes, yes. Got it. Thanks. You're welcome. We have 20 cents now. Think of what we can buy with that! Probably not very much. Goodbye, madame. I ook at that nutcracker! It smells like grunewald. I hope we have a Christmas tree this year. Of course! My dear friend. Your postcards are rays of light on an otherwise dark horizon. You are the only one from back home whom we hear from. All of the hauptmanns, einsteins, oldens... Where are they now? I can't help wondering if in the past they would have left a letter from me unanswered. Surely not. I never thought I would write this, but I'm afraid I must ask you to sell a few of our first editions. I've had my German citizenship taken away. Now I'm primarily one thing: A Jew. At least that means we don't belong to the misled masses or the Nazi mob. And Jews are experienced emigrants. And although it's painful, I'm happy to belong to a people with such rich heritage. Papa? I think I have to go up there. No, you can sit down here. Mr. kemper? Mr. kemper? I didn't mean to startle you. Do you remember me? I'm afraid I don't. Robert Stein. From the theater. Exactly. That's the one. Hello. - I didn't know you were in Paris. - My wife has family here. There's no more work for me in Berlin. We came a year ago. This is my daughter Anna. - Hello, Anna. - Hello. If you're ever there, we live in the 7th arrondissement. Maybe you and your family could come over for tea. Berlin is ancient history now. I'd love to spend time with such a brilliant mind. Thank you. I'll be in touch. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Anna. - Bye. Papa, don't you like that man? I have no reason not to. But I thought he might not like me. We bumped into Robert Stein at the synagogue. Robert Stein? - You tore him to pieces a few times. - Very true. He's an intensely untalented director. His productions were unbearable. I thought he was nice. It wasn't my job to find out how nice he was. He was bad and that's that. And if you say so then it must be true. That's right. You're so arrogant. He didn't seem very resentful. Wasn't his wife a pianist too? He invited us to tea. They live in a very fancy area. Wild horses couldn't drag me to that amateur. Thank you, mama. You're welcome. It's beautiful. - They really did turn out as pullovers. - Indeed. Did somebody doubt they would? Come here, this is for you. That's beautiful. Show me. Flick through with your thumb. It's amazing. How did you do it? Max, look. Not bad, little man! I didn't want to give you any more disasters. Is this a school bag? Your mother found a public school for you. I thought those schools were bad for people like us. Who says such nonsense? That's hard to imagine. How did you... I didn't steal them, that's for sure. Dorothea? I have something else for you. So you don't forget who you are. Happy Christmas. Thank you. A balloon. "Dear Anna, my most heartfelt wishes for a wonderful Christmas. Drop this balloon from the Eiffel Tower and the west wind is sure to blow it to my front door in Berlin. That would make me happy. I look to the new year full of hope. Things can and must get better. On that note... yours, Julius." Happy Christmas, miss grete! Good evening. If we're Jewish, why do we celebrate Christmas? I see it as a German celebration rather than a Christian one. It reminds me of wonderful family gatherings when I was your age. Do you believe in god? I'm afraid not. I only believe in gratefulness. People who don't feel grateful always lose. I'm very grateful right now, especially for my school bag. Where are you from? Anna, how long will you stay? Do you understand? Your skirt is too short. Do you have a little sister? Why are you wearing her coat? You need a uniform. I'll show you where to get one. Napoleon's victories: 1800 marengo, 1805 austerlitz, 1806 jena, 1807 friedland, 1809 wagram. Very good. You can sit down. His final defeat was in Waterloo. That was in 1815. That's true. Is that all they said about Napoleon? There are so many interesting things. The whole lesson was just learning the dates. - Hi, papa. Hi, little man. - Hello. - How was it? - Good. I got my uniform today. Understand anything yet? - No, but math is easy. - Very good. That's something at least. - You look French already. - Is that good or bad? - I don't know. - Hello. Potato soup again? - Is there meat in it at least? - You ask the same thing every day. I guess cinema is out of the question? It's the first time my classmates invited me. But I bet I can't go, can I? Okay, then you decide! Either we have a hot meal tomorrow or you go to the cinema with your pals. We can only do one or the other. So, what do we do? Will things stay like this for ever? They've got us. - The Nazis. - You silly thing. It's just the lightbulb. Max, you and I will take a walk later. That's another two francs. - So you're still hungry. - I'm always hungry. Wait here. - Shouldn't we have bought a lightbulb? - Try it, it's good. Here, monsieur. Thank you. Kids! Tell your dad the rent was due two days ago. On Friday. Was he famous in Germany, your dad? - Are you Jews? - Yes, we're Jews. You're not in Germany anymore. This is Paris. Understood? Typical! Strange people, creeping around like thieves. Right, Fifi? Jews. It's not deep. But it's so cold. - What are you doing? - I'm getting in. That's not allowed. Most of them have gone green anyway. This is crazy, Anna. Stop staring at me like a dummy and give me a hand. Hello, madame batier. Hello, girls. Light! Nobody could have imagined what would become of him. His mother was called laetitia. - How did you get the money? - Napoleon wanted recognition. - We just took a little dip. - But she never took him seriously. He excelled at school and became a leader at an incredibly young age. He won victory after victory, was even crowned emperor and made his siblings kings and queens. But his mother always said, "let's see how long it lasts." And it didn't turn out well. Would it have been different if she'd shown pride in him? Napoleon is such an interesting topic. He always fell for women who looked like his mother. But his mother didn't like any of them, of course. How do you know all this? I read up on it again just now. - I'm doing a script about his childhood. - For a movie? If someone buys it, then it might get made into a movie. Good night. Good night. Good night. Do you know things about Napoleon? Yes, he didn't have a musical bone in his body. The only thing he liked were drums and trumpets. But there was a corsican nursery rhyme that he always remembered. Papa is having nightmares again. Let me sleep. But I'm scared. Can't you sleep? Is grete a Nazi? Maybe. Perhaps she just doesn't like Jews. Like madame prune. - Will there be food? - Certainly. Don't be too loud. Be on your best behavior, okay? Right. - Mrs. kemper, how lovely. - Mrs. Stein, thanks for the invitation. Come inside. I was so pleased to get your call. I get so incredibly bored all day. Come. Hannah, Gustav, our guests are here! Just because our husbands are immature, it doesn't mean we have to be. - Isn't that so? - Indeed. I'm thrilled to have visitors from Berlin. My husband never meant it personally. He loves theater so much that sometimes he... Mrs. kemper, Robert was incredibly hurt by what your husband wrote, but I'm sure that in the end it helped him develop. What is your husband working on now? He's writing a script about Napoleon. He has time right now. Napoleon? How interesting. You can leave the table if you're done. Thank you. I'll show you my room. - Would you like a liqueur? - Certainly. Does it suit me? I'll wear it on the golf course. What a charming idea! You look like a buttercup. You'll be followed by swarms of butterflies. And you, my dearest heart, look like a lampshade. Take whatever you like. We have too much anyway. If you don't, it'll be donated to the needy. We're needy too. We also have lots of German books that we already read. You know how to read, don't you? Read? What do you mean? Our parents don't believe in education. You'll give that all back! My kids don't need handouts. Certainly not from that clown! We're not beggars! Do you know what your kids need? They need food and clothes and all kinds of things. And I couldn't care less where we get it. You're not a famous critic living in grunewald anymore. Those days are over. If the clothes were meant for poor children anyway, why not give them to ours? I'm not giving these pants back. You don't have to. Are we poor now? - Very good, manon. - Thank you. Anna, 147 mistakes. You have to work harder, or you won't move up to the next class. Do you understand? Rosalie, good. Anna, you have very pretty shoes. - Catherine, very good. - Thanks. Isabelle, watch your commas. A year ago, he lost his job at the natural history museum. I didn't know that. Hello. This is our daughter Anna. Julius was her godfather. Anna, this is heinz rosenfeld, one of Julius's friends. - From Berlin. - Hello. So, you're Anna. Julius didn't want you to worry. Carry on. He was doing fairly well for a long while. He went to the zoo every day and visited his animals. He did menial work in a cigarette factory twice a week. Julius knew I would go to Paris. I have family here. Is he dead? After they banned him from the zoo, he became gloomy. He wouldn't leave his room any more. Was Julius Jewish? His grandmother was. It seems that was enough for them. He was tired. He didn't want to live anymore. But it was very important to him that you receive this. You can choose between two topics. "A journey" and "a day at the beach". You can start. Arthur, that's pointless. If she doesn't find us today, she'll come back tomorrow. Tomorrow I might have money. I don't want to deal with her right now. We're not here and the light stays off. Where else would we be? Maybe it's only grete. Only grete? She's even... Mr. kemper? Stop this nonsense and open the door! - I know that you're there! - If we... This is what happens when they let people like you in. Liars! I have my eye on you, Mr. kemper! You won't get past me without paying. Dirty Jew. That's degrading. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18... Thank you, madame. Madame, why is there money on my test? Oh, right, I'd completely forgotten. Children, listen to me. Anna arrived only a year ago and couldn't speak a word of French. Her spelling still leave something to be desired, but her essay won the school competition. Mr. moulin awarded her ten francs for her journey story. What do we say? Anna, please come to the front and read your story out loud. "A journey". By Anna kemper. "It was a cold February night. Arthur had a bad cold. He should have stayed in bed. Suddenly the telephone rang. I'm a friend, ' the voice said. 'And I have to warn you.' I failed needlework, but I did really well in sport. We had to stand on one leg for two minutes. That was easy. So being good at standing on one leg makes up for how you sew? Only at a girls' school! Who's writing to papa from england? Hello, miss grete. And? Is it good? Absolutely. I'm top of my class. “Wonderful. Anna got a gold medal for standing on one leg. Don't be stupid. I won some money actually. What for? - I wrote about your journey. - Show me. You Jews always have to be the best, don't you? - You have mail from england. - Thanks. - Shall I read you my story? - Please do. Math wasn't easy, but I got 18 points there too. Only me and one boy in the 7th managed that. Really? I have such clever children. "A journey by Anna kemper." - They want to buy it. - Who wants to buy what? Napoleon. The english want to buy my script. They're paying good money too. Wow, this is amazing! You get dizzy. Watch out! Dear balloon, fly to Berlin. Good luck. Think it will make it to Berlin? Maybe it won't have to. I think Julius is very close. Look, it's already over les invalides, Napoleon's tomb. To Julius, my friend. Now? Yes. We've thought about moving to London. There's just not enough work here. Are you joking? I've only just started to like it here. And with this script job... We could go ahead to London and see if we can find an apartment. You could board at school for two weeks. No, we can't! You can't leave us alone in Paris for a single day! But Anna... Parents sometimes have to leave their children alone for a short while. In england many children go to boarding school. Those kids have a home and we don't! If you have no home, you have to stay together! Otherwise you get lost. I agree, little man. Don't call me that! I'm not small and I'm not a man. Can we never go back home? I don't know. Maybe one day. But not now. Maybe we'll never be at home in one single place, but a little bit at home in many different places. That could be nice too. Well... Excuse me. Goodbye, gray house. Goodbye, rue de la victoire. Give me that. I'll put it in the back. - Hello Arthur. - Hello. There's something I wanted to say. What did you say to madame prune? That's between me and her. That's english. Understand anything? Not a word. We're back to square one. We don't know anyone and don't understand anything. What odd customs do the english have? I can't wait to eat a lovely piece of old cheese in London tonight. I don't understand a word, but it doesn't matter. Because soon, soon I will understand it all. In 1935 Judith kerr and her family emigrated to england.
