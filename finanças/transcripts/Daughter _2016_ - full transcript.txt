Why aren't you asking for dinner or something? What for? She's got admission for her Master's degree! Then we should all be invited to dinner by Setareh! Hand me your glasses. I'll buy you a pair! You're still infatuated by glasses? Do you remember Dr Shakibaei, guys? What a character! Remember? Did I tell you what he texted me? I was like: "Please give me a pass mark since it's my final semester." And he said: "It'd cost you!" I chatted with him on Saturdays, Mondays and Wednesdays. He thought I was the girl living across from the street where he lived. He fell for me and kept sending me flowers. You don't say! I'm so proud of you! The next project is going to be Setareh's dad! No way, forget about him! You know what, he's getting a son-in-law! - You? - No, no, it's Samira! - Your sister! - Congrats! So she finally surrendered to misery! If we weren't living in Tehran, our grandchildren would be running around us by now! I've got some real news for you, guys! There's someone who's willing to marry her now! Yeah! Why don't you tell me? We're all ears! He used to be our neighbour. His mum has seen my mum at a party. What does he look like? - He's fine, it's just that.. - He's bald! Don't say it like that! - Have they come to ask for your hand? - Yeah. Did you offer them tea? It's your first suitor! Don't rush into anything! We're still too young. I don't think it's even possible to marry someone without love. Yeah, we've still got our lives ahead of us. Stop it! It won't kill you! It's not just about love. There are other things that matter too. This one is experienced! Let me finish! No, I mean...seriously... Go and have fun with your hubby! Will you just listen? Damn, I forgot what I wanted to say! Sadaf has been wasting her time with Armin for 5 years now! Listen, guys! I think marriage is an agreement. I say you should demand for bigger Consent Prizes (aka Mahr). You'd stay with him if he was any good. And if he's no good, you won't have to go back to your dad's. - You'll be independent? - Yeah, why not? But that's when you've got lots of choices. Not like now that my mother says they've been calling our house non-stop! My mother says lots of stuff like that too. I think you should take charge of your life. Each person is a medium! Hear, hear! You should make the best of anywhere you go. A restaurant, a party, etc. - May I take your order, ladies? - Guys! Let's order at once! Cappuccino. Excuse me. Is that gentleman sitting over there the coffee house's manager? Yes, Mr Saeidi runs this place. - Is he single or married? - Married with two kids, ma'am! Damn! Will you order, guys? I bet he likes you! Order, please! - What will you have? - Crisps and whatever there is! - Everyone is hungry! - No, I'd like crisps and cheese. Setareh! Will you give me a hand? This is killing me! Why do you keep asking me? What about Samira? I'm preparing my dress. You keep complaining about each other! I'm sick of it! Come on! Move it! Right away! Will you tell dad, mum? You know he won't agree to it, so why even bother? Hold this curtain. I'm coming down. You mean like this? When did you ever help me out for this to be the second time? Don't bother, I'll take care of it myself. I've matched the dress with this scarf and I'm going to wear this necklace. Tell him, mum! How can I say that? He won't let you go on your own. And I had no idea your sister's wedding was being arranged so soon! I don't go with you. Why don't you tell him yourself? - Myself? - Yeah! But who can even talk to dad? It hurts me when Samira and you say talk like that about your dad! What did I say? Does this dress looks good on me or what? You're going to wear white? This is not your engagement party, remember? - White is no good! - Don't get too carried away! But it looks perfect, Samira. Let her say all she wants! Hi. Where should I put these, uncle? I don't know. Ask the one who's told you to bring them here! All right! You never come and visit us, Hassan! Hi there. Sorry, I'm in a hurry to go back to the refinery. You know Ahmad. He'll cut my head off if I'm late! Sorry, we're leaving so early. Hassan is in a hurry. - Will you give this plate to me? - Where did you get the Separates? - Is that its name? - Yeah, it's English. Is this English? No, its name is. What are they teaching you at school then? See this? It has served me 40 years! 40 years! Yeah, your grandmother packed my lunch in it. Really... Let me see your hand. This colours is much cooler! - Seriously? - Yeah, it's more girlie. Abadan iris are all bronzed and beautiful. Gholam! The handyman is here. Take him to the atelier and see if it fits. Everyone is waiting for you. All the big figures of the town are here. Representatives from the Governor's office, the Municipality and the Free Zone. They all want to see you. What do they want? I don't know. I couldn't figure it out, sir. Where are they? In the office. They're all in there. What about the compressor? Its shaft is the problem. Do you think we should send it to Aghajari or not? Why there? What's wrong with our own lads? Send the shaft to turnery and the lads will take care of it. Yes, sir. I can't expect any more of them. They're doing all they can. What else can we expect with the kind of money we're paying them? Listen to me! I don't want you to analyse anything now. Just balance it! The compressor should be as good as new in two days! Got it? Mr Ahmad Azizi is caretaker of the Maintenance Section of Abadan Refinery. Now under the unjust international sanctions. What did you tell the lad? The one at the turnery? - Who? - The newcomer! Oh, you mean Farhad. He's not a newcomer. Whatever! - What were you whispering to him? - Nothing. What did he give you? It's in your pocket! My pocket. Oh, you mean this? What is it? It's made of waste. It's a handicraft. Of course it was made outside work hours. It's got nothing to do with Setareh, right? It actually has. She ordered it and I asked the boy to make it for her. That's all. Don't you listen to me, Hassan? - How many times should I tell you? - But what did I do, bro? Stop pretending like you don't know anything! Do you want me to smash your head? Get yourself together, man! I've done nothing! He's a really good boy too. He's good at what he does. It's just a misunderstanding. Get out! - But we're not there yet! - I said get out! Fine! - Hi, Mr Azizi! - Hi. Yeah, I just got home. What is it? What did you tell him? - Hi. - What did he say? Hi! Samira, pour a cup of tea for your dad. Did he say this or you did? Well! Well, neither of you understand a thing! Tell him! Tell him, for God's sake! Listen to me! - Watch the oven, Samira - Don't worry about that. Just do as I say! Tell them to call Azizi himself! Tell them you're not in charge there. Give me my food, I should head back to work right away. Dad, uncle brought the cookies. Did you see him? Yeah, I saw him on my way. Oh, I didn't realise you already had your cup of tea. Sit down. Is there anything you want to tell me? - Me? No. - Say it. - Well, do you remember Pooneh? - No, who's that? My classmate from university. She's from Tehran. She went to university here. - You've met her, remember? - She's been to our house? - Yeah. - So what is wrong with her? Nothing is wrong with her. She's been granted a scholarship in Canada. She's going with her mother. They've thrown a goodbye party. Not one of those parties. It's just us girls hanging out with each other. Hello? Hi, yes. Yes, I heard that, but we're talking about miserable workers, sir. They've got wives and kids to think of. The budget deficit is someone else's fault and they should pay for it? Why should they pay for every single mishap around here? Where were you when they were working at 70 degrees? It's legal? Well, so be it! Anything legal should be exercised? No way, sir! When I say no, it's a no! Do whatever you want! Go to the Refinery's CEO for all I care! Tell him that Azizi says no! The hell with the lay-off! Where are you going, Setareh? You were saying something. It's nothing. Nothing? You were talking about your friend Pooneh! What are you talking about? All right, sorry, I was too busy with work stuff. Now let's sit here and tell me everything. I just wanted to see if you'd allow me to go to her party. Party? When? Tomorrow! Tomorrow? I'll fly there and back. What? On a plane? Where is this party you're talking about? - Tehran. - Tehran? What do you think of me, Setareh? Huh? Have I ever sent you or your sister away on your own? Have you lost your mind? What is she talking about, Nahid? Have I ever allowed any such thing? Where are you? Should I answer such questions? Should I always be the one to tell you what's right or wrong? Where the hell are you then? Do you even understand what you're saying? Let it go! I'll gather them for you later. I knew your dad wouldn't allow it! Hopefully some other time. Forget about it! I should just shut up and say nothing. Just because dad doesn't want to hear it. It's always like that. I said I'll fold it, sweetie. You're the star (Setareh) of my house. They weren't supposed to come and ask for your sister's hand today. Your dad brought it forward to prevent it from interfering with his work trip. I've told you a month ago! We've been programming with the girls. I just wanted to go there and be back in one day! You don't know your dad? When he says no, it's a no! - Not least in this situation! - But I'll be embarrassed in front of my friends. Everyone will be there except for me! All of them know it's just because of my dad! Well, tell them about tonight. Dad wouldn't let me go anyway! Isn't there anyone around you? No, I've come to the rooftop. Then the weather is fine. Ahwaz is such a mess. Haven't you seen the news? - You're changing the subject. - Yeah! You don't even understand the condition I'm in. Of course I do! The sun has set behind the river and the boats are passing by. On one side, there's the busy Amiri St. On the other, you can see the refinery's lights. Any breeze would bring the smell of the refinery. Do you want me to tell one of the boats to blow its horn for you? Yeah, do that! Wait a second then! - Did you hear that? -Yeah, I did! - Samira! - Yes, dad? - Bring me the tool box. - Sure. Hi, where are you Soheila? I called you a lot. I'm home, where are you? I arrived. What's our plan? Nothing. We'll go to our English lesson and then will have lunch together. Then we'll head back home. Come on, don't be so naive, Soheila! After lunch, we'll go to the central bazaar and then we'll head home. But I'm really afraid, Setareh. Stop this nonsense! Bye! Welcome! - Where is your exact address? - What? - The exact address! - I just said it! Ferdowsi Sq. Where are you coming from? Abadan! Hi, Setareh! How are you? How are you, guys? Look at her! Where did you get this antique? It's not an antique. It's a Separates! Zeparates? Separates! It comes from Separate! It has 3 separate containers. They're placed on top of each other like this. Wow! How great! It's so interesting. It's open, be careful! It's so cute! It used to be my grandfather's. Girls, I'm so going to miss this Falafel when I leave here. No way! Iranians are all over the world now... and have filled everywhere with all sorts of Persian food! So no worries! But my dad won't be there. I'm going to miss my dad. How stupid are you! But family is important! These two are so spoiled! I think you should go somewhere where you can be free. You mean where? You know what? She only considers freedom as the right to wear top and shorts! But that is a part of freedom anyway. I mean that's the way you think. Do you consider freedom being fined for a couple of hair streaks? She's right. I'm with her on this. Control is in no way pleasant. It bothers us all. But the experience of our parents is really useful at times. Their experiences are from 3 generations ago. But even people from 3 generations ago are useful at times. How have they been useful to you? Sadaf! I for one never found any use in that. She didn't mean that! Let's be friends, gals! Freedom! Tell me about it! I haven't got any freedom on the internet either. My grandma has opened a Facebook account and I now can't put up any photo because of her! - Your grandma is on FB? - You're kidding me! I swear to God I can't put up a single photo. She already knows all my friends. - How is that even possible? - Yeah! - How old is your grandma? - 75. - How cute! - That's not cute! It bugs me! - She can't do anything now! - You know what, guys? In Iran we're shot from our parents' house to our husband's! What do you mean? I mean they simply pass us onto the husband's house. What does that mean? It's just they're just trying to get rid of us. They don't want our responsibility. That's not getting rid of us! It is. It's exactly like that for girls our age. Can I say something? Hush everyone! Golnoosh wants to tell us something. What is it, honey? - Don't rush me, guys! - We won't! Just say it! Well, I think... - What? - In any family... Then what? Or in any country there are some problems. You will face those problems wherever you go. But I think...why are you laughing? I think when you immigrate... Come on, guys! I think a person who immigrates is like a person who's running away. Take a note, girls! What a phrase was that! Well done! I should write it down! Immigration means running away. I'll never come back if I ever leave! - Me neither. - Let's go together! But I will. I definitely will! - You'd better! - I'll miss my dad. What about you Setareh? Would you come back? It's nearly 2 o'clock, gals! Your flight is at 3. Let's go! Don't worry. I'll give you a ride. I'll go too! You can't beat me at racing! You should come with me, Setareh! - Who's coming with me? - Run, girls! I won't go with you! You'll have us killed! Next time, girl! Minoo! It's a real race! Be careful! Aren't you coming, Golnoosh? Golnoosh? Aren't you coming? What are you doing? Run, girls! Run! A half hour before the flight the counter is closed Everyone has their boarding passes now. There's nothing we can do. But my flight is at 3. We're here 20 minutes early! I know. But the counter is closed and boarding has been completed. But I remember we had a flight to Isfahan and they let us in 10 minutes before take-off! That flight must have been delayed. That's why they've let you in. For God's sake, sir! I need to get on that flight. Wait a second. There's no way we can fit the 6 of you in! No, no, it's just her. - Is it just you? - Yes, yes, it's just me. Aren't you going to say you've got baggage too? - No, no, nothing. - She's got just a bag. - Is it Ms Mahoor Alvand? - No, no, it's Setareh Azizi. Mr Mojtahedi, you're such a good-looking man. My dad is your colleague. He's in the Air Force. I'll do my best. You're lucky. The flight is delayed! Just be quick! Thanks! Run! The gate is being closed, Ms. Hurry up! Just a second! Come on! You're going to miss the flight! Let me hold you! Let her go, Hanieh! Bye, Setareh! Stop it! You're making me nauseous! Setareh! Hello, Ms. Welcome aboard! Thanks, she was the last passenger. Soheila! - Are you really in your seat now? - Yeah, I'm taking my seat right now. Don't be late, Setareh. I'm getting really worried. No worries! Excuse me, ma'am. That's my seat. Be careful, Soheila. I should turn off my phone now. Just cover for me for another hour or so. In the Name of God. Captain Homa Karimi is speaking. I'd like to welcome you aboard and apologise for the delay. I should inform you that unfortunately, according to the latest reports from Abadan airport... ...the horizontal view is still compromised due to the existence of heavy dust... and therefore we won't be able to proceed with our flight today. This decision is being taken for your own safety. We wish to see you soon in Iran Air flights. Hold on a second! I don't know, really. - What happened, ma'am? - The flight is cancelled. - Cancelled? - Yeah. So we'll have to take another flight? No, the plane is fine. It's because of the dust in Abadan. They say the weather in Abadan is bad and the flight is cancelled. This is not a good joke! What's going on, Setareh? Where are you? Setareh? Hello? Hello? Are you all right, Ms? Call an attendant. She's not feeling well. Don't worry, honey. - What is it, mum? - She can't breathe. Have you got a respiratory condition, Ms? Do you have a spray? Fan her, mum! Can you find it in there? Let me loosen your scarf, honey. - She can't breathe! - Can you find your spray? Lean back, please. Oxygen, please What's the matter? Ms? Please report that there's someone with a respiratory problem here. I'll call an ambulance. Can you breathe now? I'll take this off now. Don't rush! - Why is that necessary? - I'm taking your BP. No, no, I'm fine. Isn't any member of family with the patient? I don't know. Her flight was just cancelled. I'm running late. I need to go! No way. Your BP is low. You need this IV. No, I can't wait, ma'am. Let me check. Hi, our friend Setareh Azizi is here. - Yes, she's over here. - You can't go all at once! - What is all this about? - She's fine. Leave her alone! - What happened? - She's fine. Don't worry. Give it to me. Wait! - What is going on, Nahid? - Nothing... it's nothing. Delina! Didn't I tell you not to go out in this weather? Come back in at once! Ms Moradi! Haven't you heard from Setareh and Soheila? - Haven't they called you? - Is something wrong? No, it's nothing. Go and change. The guests will arrive any time now. Can I talk to her for a second? - Is Soheila in? - She is! Give that to me! Hey honey. She left you an hour ago? Then she must be on her way, thanks. Bye. Could there be any worse time for these people to come? How could they know it'd be a dusty day! - Is this good, Razieh? - It's great, uncle. You look perfect! Where is Hassan, then? Call him! The guests will be here any second now! I just did. He's on his way. Drink this. It's sugary, it's good for you. - You'll feel better after a sip of this. - I don't feel like it. Stop it! It's my dad, Pooneh! What should I do now? Don't answer it! Don't! Let me talk to him. I know what to say. What are you going to tell him? I think it'd be best if my dad called him. Don't make things so complicated! Give that to me, Pooneh! Quiet, girls! You don't know her dad! What are you talking about? I know what to say to him. I'll say it's our fault since we invited her. No, please don't! I know he won't buy that! Quiet! He's calling again. Do not answer, Sepideh! Hi, Mr Azizi. I'm Sepideh. Setareh's friend. I'll give the phone to her in a second. It's just that.. Setareh has come to Tehran since we insisted so much for her to come! I just asked them. All the flights to Khoozestan are cancelled for now. Hush! It's her dad! She wanted to come back, but all the flights to Abadan have been cancelled due to the dust. Please hear me out for a second... Mr Azizi! But you don't even let me say a word! She's not well! The hell with that! Hand the damn phone to her! Who the hell are you? What is she doing in Tehran? Give the damn phone to her right now! Where are you? We're in Tehran Airport's ER. Hello? He was really mad. He said: "Don't go anywhere. I'm on my way Oh my God! You're making a big deal of it, Setareh! It's all right. You'll stay with us until your dad arrives. You can stay with us too. Everything's going to be fine. He's really coming? So what? There's nothing wrong with that. It's all your fault! He doesn't even let me talk to him! The stress isn't good for you, Setareh! Let it go! Why don't you get it? Your friends come here all the time, but this is different. Didn't you see how her father was making such a big deal of... her coming to your party? She'd go back on a plane in a couple days. What's wrong with that? Keep it down, mum. She might hear you. How can you control that kind of irrational father? What if he causes a scene in front of all the neighbours? Mum... Do you need anything? - Where is the bathroom, Pooneh? - Over there. - Hi. - Hi, sweetie. Are you feeling better? Excuse me. He's just being a father. He's worried about her daughter. I'd do the same thing. If not her father, then who should come after her? Why don't you prescribe the same medicine for your own family? Why don't you go with us? Aren't you a father? There we go again Staying or leaving, that is the question. - Hi, Ahmad. Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. - I just talked to Setareh. - So? Please be kind with her. I'm worried about her. You're both mad and tired. That girl is sick, Ahmad. She just made a mistake. She was crying over the phone all the time. She's staying at her friend Pooneh's place. Text me her friend's address. - All right. - I'll pick her up. Bye. I need some petrol, sir. But you haven't eaten anything, hon. Have some more. I'm full. Just a bite. Are you still feeling... are you all right? By the way, I showed photos of Farhad's statues to my dad. He really liked them and said that boy is a real artist. Thanks. He said he'd definitely have a word about him with his friend. I'm really for causing you so much trouble, Setareh. My dad says I should appreciate you more for coming all this way to say goodbye to me. - Can I say something, Pooneh? - Sure, hon. To be honest, you were not the entire reason why I came here. I just wanted to decide for myself for once! I get you. Just don't be mad with my mum. She's never like that at all. I guess she's become a bit nervous... ...since our departure is only days away and my dad isn't going with us. My dad wasn't like this either. He just changed ever since we went to high school. He became such a strict father overnight. Everything was fine when we were younger. He was like a friend to us. But now he only expects a daughter to do as her father says. He thinks I've got no taste or feeling or even a right to share my opinion. He's just always right and whatever we say is wrong! He suspects everything we do. We can't protest any of his actions. You know what, Pooneh... I think he doesn't want to accept that we're grownups now. - I wish I never came here. - Calm down. Sorry to bother you, ladies. It's hot cocoa milk. Hurry up before it gets cold. All right. Hello, Mr Azizi. Come in, please. Hello. Please tell Setareh to come. - Why don't you have a cup of tea with us? - No, thank you. I'm in a hurry. But you must be really tired, Mr Azizi. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? Invite him to come in. Yes, sure. Setareh is still asleep. Yes, yes. The girls are still in bed. - Please wake them up then. - All right. But after driving for such a long time, you must be tired. Have a cup of tea with us. Hi, dad. Thank you for having me. I'm worried about you. You must be really tired. Sorry for bothering you. Hi, Mr Azizi. How are you? Setareh has left her spray in our place. Dad! Dad! I know I made a mistake. Why don't you look at me? I didn't want this to happen. I'd told mum since a month ago. I just wanted to see my friends. I had promised them. I would be embarrassed if I didn't go. I'm really sorry, dad. Just say something, you're scaring me. What is the matter with you, moron? Have you sold your sheep and come to the city? He's swearing at me because of you! Get out of the car, chimpanzee! It was my fault? You just push the gas pedal? - Why are you swearing? Huh? - Calm down! You came in a one-way street and call me responsible? It's all right, sir. Go ahead. He thinks I owe him now! But he just turned into the alley! You should pay for my bike! - Here you are! - You both got lucky! He just comes in the wrong direction and acts like it's my fault! Let go of me. People are used to swear at anything in this city! Setareh! Hi. Hi. Did you leave anything behind? Sorry for bothering you. Isn't Setareh here? But she left with you. I know. But I left the car for some reason and when I went back, she wasn't there. I thought she might have come here. - Did you have a fight? - Fight? Not with her. I shouted at her and left the car; when I went back, she'd disappeared. Her mobile phone is off, too. Hasn't she come back here? Tell me exactly what happened. I said Setareh is not with me anymore! Let me put my clothes on and we'll go together. Pooneh! Wear your coat and get ready to go. Right away. Why did she leave? I knew something would happen. - Is the bike rider all right? - Yes, he's fine. She's not answering her phone, dad. Call all the girls. All of those who were at the coffee place yesterday. All of them? Do you know what time it is? It's all right. Tell them what happened. Call Sepideh Her father has had a night shift last night. So they're up! Are you sure you've looked everywhere around where you last saw her? Yes, I did. Go straight down this street. Hi, Hossein. Are you at the Police Station? We're coming to see you. It's important. All right, see you. - Do we really have to go to the police? - Yes, it's a necessary step. They're not answering, dad. I'll text them. - Isn't this Setareh's phone? - Yes, that's it! Does it have a password? I know what it is. Give it to me for a second. What did you do, Mr Azizi? Won't she need this? Its battery has run out. She told me last night, but mine wouldn't work with it. It's Setareh?s mother. - All right, answer. - But she'll get ruined! Well, then don't tell her anything. Setareh might have called her or something. Hello, Nahid. Hold on a second. Hey, Nahid! Speak a bit louder. I can't hear you well. Yeah, her mobile phone's battery has run out. I picked her up at her friend's this morning. She's now asleep in the car. Thank God! I knew you would be kind to her. Thank you, Ahmad. It's all right. Are you crying, Nahid? She was so afraid! I said she's fine. Do you want me to wake her? No, no, let her sleep. She probably hasn't slept at all last night. Honey, you haven't slept for 24 hours now. Find a hotel or something and get some rest before driving home. All right. No worries. I'll tell her to call you when she wakes up. Bye for now. The Missing People Unit has just notified us that there's no one with these specs in their accounts. - Follow up on that every few minutes. - Yes, sir. I just checked the hospitals, Colonel. Thank God she's not hospitalised. Why don't you have a seat? Have a seat, Mr Azizi! I know you're worried. But there are a lot of cases like this in our work. Your daughter's condition is optimal. She's got money and she hasn't run with a prior plan. So it's not dangerous. She's scared. Haven't you got any relatives in Tehran? No. Any not so immediate family member or something? No, I've got no one here. It's being charged, Colonel. Yes, Pooneh, turn it on! She's got the password. - Anything else, sir? - Go ahead. Hossein! There was a Mr Azizi in the Irregular Warfare Staff during war. Doesn't he look like that man? Yes, yes, actually he does look familiar to me. Thank you. Wasn't he related to you? No. Oh, it's turned on. Show me her recent call list. I want to see who she's talked to last. It's here. Far? Who is Far? I don't know. Don't you know anyone whose name starts with F? Someone she might want to hide from you? Farhad! Do you know him? Yes, that's her suitor! May I, sir? Here, I just called his number. It's on speaker mode. Talk to him. He might have some useful information. Hi, we're not home, please leave a message. Whose voice is that? Do you recognise it? No. Let me call the number again. Oh, he's calling back. Go ahead and answer it. Hello, Setareh? Sorry it got disconnected the first time. What happened? Did you see your dad? Why did you turn off your phone? I'm very worried about you now. Text me when your dad shows up. I've texted you my address. Just come here if there's any problem. It's a Tehran phone number. Is it your sister? Yes. I can tell you didn't even consider the probability of her going to her aunt's. You haven't been in touch with your sister for a long time, right? Do you want us to get involved? No, I'd better go there myself. - Who is this? - It's me, Ahmad. Come in, please. Hi. Hi. - Did you find here easily? - Yeah, the address was direct enough. Is Setareh here? Aren't you coming inside? Why, you didn't have to do this. Sorry I left you alone. I'll be right back. Mohsen has pre-bought an apartment which will be ready in 5-6 months. He wanted to rent a place, but I didn't let him. This is his shop's storage, and I made it a makeshift place for us. When will he be back from work? Mohsen? He won't come back tonight. He's away on a work trip. What does he do?! Aren't you going to ask how I'm doing? He's got a shoes factory. Where is Setareh then? When will she come? She will. By the time you eat something, she'll show up. I've brought you dates. - Is she all right? - No worries. She'll be back in a couple hours. Why had that boy come with her? What boy? She'd come here to say goodbye to a classmate. - Hadn't she told you about it? - Yes, she had. - Farzaneh! - Yes, honey? - Are you in? - Yeah! Hi there, Mehri! I really need your help. I'm going to a party and I've ruined my eyebrows! What did you do to them? I can't do anything right now. I've got a visitor. Whose was that pair of men's shoes? It's my brother. I'll fix them later. But your brother isn't a stranger. But I can't do it now. Just take a couple streaks from here. All right. She's my upstairs neighbour. I'm really sorry. This will take only a minute. - Hi. How are you? - Hi. I'm so happy to see you. Farzaneh keeps singing your praise! - Let's go, Mehri! - I'm sorry. Don't do it that way. - Am I a hairstylist or you? - You! Whatever! Then stop laughing! Hello? Hi, Ahmad! How are you? Yeah, what's up? Nothing much. I did some research on this lad, Farhad. His mother is sick and they've gone to Shiraz. Any news of the compressor? They've opened it up, everyone is waiting for you. It's got nothing to do with me. Tell them to do their work. Tell them I won't be back for a couple days. All right. I'll tell them. - Are you staying at Farzaneh's? - Yeah, I'm in Tehran. Bye. Thank you. It looks much better than the last time. Ahmad... Sorry for bothering you. You should appreciate having such a number one make-up artist as your sister. You're welcome. Please come and visit us sometime while you're here. Bye. Take this, Farzaneh. I sometimes do this stuff to keep myself busy. Only for neighbours though, no strangers. The water heater stinks. The flame isn't burning properly. Its chimney is rusty. I'll have it fixed tomorrow. Let's wait for Setareh to come. She won't be back tonight. She's with a friend of mine. Don't worry, she's safe there. But call her to come. I'll be nice with her. Give her some more time. Trust me. You shouldn't have hit her, Ahmad! Enough! Eat something. Here, have some more meat. Remember what mum always did at the table? She'd divide the meat pieces for us so we wouldn't have to fight over them! How poor were we! Have some vegetables. Are you up, Shirin? She's afraid of the thunder. This is uncle Ahmad. Say hi! This is Shirin, my sweet little girl. She wants to say hi to her uncle. Say hi, sweetie. Hi there! Come here! She's still too sleepy. She's been out camping today, that's why she's so tired. I want milk, mummy! You want milk? All right, honey. You go on eating and we'll grab some milk. Let's go honey. Did you see your uncle Ahmad? You were asleep when he arrived. Didn't I tell you how kind he is. He's here to see you. - Is he Setareh's dad? - Yeah, sweetie. They live very far from here. That's why you haven't seen him before. Is Setareh gone? Hush! Go back to sleep. - Here, this towel is cleaner. - Thank you. Have you been in touch with Setareh for a long time? Not so long, but we sometimes talk. Have you got some tissue or paper? - For saying our prayers on? - Yeah. Why, I'll bring you a prayer rug! Have you still got this lamp? Yeah, remember when dad brought to for me from Kuwait? He got you a shirt. You were always jealous of me for this. Turn it off, the kid is asleep. - Do you remember this beat-up car? - Yeah. Mummy called it Red Bowl! Remember how dad would feel like going on a trip and when we were asleep they'd put us in the car... ...and when we woke up, we were in a different city? The car would break down in the middle of the road all the time! Don't say a word! - Did he say anything - He's talking in his sleep. What's the Qibla direction? It's this way, I'll prepare the rug for you. Don't forget about the single items, Mohammad. Hi, Farzaneh. Maryam accepted to fill in for you, so don't worry at all. Hope you're having fun with your brother. Bye. Put the boots and the heels over there. - How many still remain? - There's still some. Go, go, go... straight that way. All right! Hi. Move it, lads! - How many more, Ismael? - About 30 more pairs. Then hurry up! It's getting late! Over here! Go up there. Here, put this on top. I don't know why it doesn't open the door. - Are you sure you've got the right keys? - Yeah, it's just like my own home! Your wife has changed the locks. Yes? Hi, Mr Azizi! Welcome! When did you come? Who is this? You probably don't know me. I'm Mohsen, Farzaneh's husband. Oh, hi, Mohsen! - Good to see you. - What are we going to do now, Mohsen? Hold on a second. Why don't you wait inside and I'll be right there with you? - What's the deal now? - Just a second! - But this is the third time you're doing this! - For God's sake, just a moment! Let go of me! I can't! I've got a visitor! - Mrs Azizi! - Shahram! Shahram! Let go of me What's the matter? Don't close the damn door! They might steal my bike! - Mrs Azizi! - What is it? You be the judge, sir! I've got two bounced checks from this lad and one from Mrs Azizi! I've been running around for my money for 3 months now! What should I do? I want my money! Ahmad! I'm really sorry. I'll fix this. Will you just stay inside? How the hell are you going to fix it? I'll fix it myself. He's my guest! Does this place belong to him, sir? Why are you embarrassing me in front of my visitor? Stop it, Shahram! All right. Let's say this place is really yours while you haven't got the keys to it! And you pretend this gentleman is your guest? You think you can fool me? Give me my damn money! I offered to give you shoes instead! What shoes? Are you high or something! Those Chinese pairs won't do me any good! You would have sold them by now if you could! But they're still shoes. It's my business! You think I'm doing better than you? At least you got to buy this for your kid! I can't do even that! Here, it's yours. I can't just bring money from the sky! Stop this nonsense! You should be ashamed! I want my money! Mrs Azizi! Why am I even telling you all this? Lower your voice! What is it? - I want my money, sir! - I'll pay you! - Are you going to pay me? - Yeah, how much is it? All right, it's 2.650.000 tomans. - Shahram, I'll take care of this. - Let me get my money! No, Ahmad! Please don't! What a rain! Get under the umbrella! Let me see if they've got any Javelin. Get under this! - Hi there! - Hi! - Have you got Javelins? - I do. - How much per kg? - 17.000 tomans. 17.000 is too much. I'll take this one. - What do you want it for? - Qelya kebab. You can use lionfish too. No, she doesn't like it. This is lionfish. It's 23.000 per kg. It's a good one. . I don't want lionfish. I want to make Qelya. I need Javelin for that. - Have you got any salmon? - Of course, it's farmed. - How much per kg? - 14.000. That's expensive! What is it? Yeah, I was just telling him that. You're overcharging! Give it to me for 15.000! The price is 17.000, ma'am! No bargaining! You can take two smaller ones! - Are these two good? - Yeah. All right. Only small ones. I'm not paying you much! - It's a small one, ma'am! - Thank you. - I envy you. - Me? - Yeah. - What for? That will be 62.000 tomans. The way Ahmad has come all this way after you. He never did that for me. Do you want me to prepare it for you? No, you're going to overcharge me for that too. I can do that myself! Thanks. It's 2000 short. God bless your business! All night. You're a regular customer after all. Bye. Setareh! Hold this umbrella! Sweetie, stay under the umbrella! I'm really sorry I raised my voice. Thank you. Hi, sorry the first ATM machine wasn't working, so we had to use another one. Here's your card and here are the checks. 2.650.000, here's the receipt. Thank you so much. I'm really sorry. I didn't want to trouble you. Please don't think of me as a bad person. It all just happened. Now if you'll excuse me. Bye. I know what you're probably thinking of me. You never approved of me, but... - Hi there. - Hi, Tahereh. Say hi to the family. - I will. You too. - Thanks. Believe me, I did what I could. It wasn't to be. The market is down. I know why Farzaneh has called you to come. You know her too well. She's your sister after all. When she decides for something, you can never change her mind. If she'd agreed to sell the house at first, I would have to pay so much interest for my loans. I should go now. Bye. Bye. Don't worry, there's a glasses store in our street. They'll fix it. It's just a screw. - Mum! Look! - What? - It's my kindergarten, auntie Setareh. - Where is it? All right. Sit down, honey. Over there! Look! - It's her kindergarten. - And my mum works there! - Wow, how great! - Sit down, honey! - Take off your shoes, sweetie. - I can't! Here, let me help you. Are you up, Ahmad? I've brought you your Setareh. - Don't tell her anything. - Ok. I should call the handyman to come and fix the chimney. I'll fix it myself. Are you sure? It's three floors! Wow, look at my sweet girl's hat! Tell your uncle where we went! We bought fish, chicken, tomatoes and carrots. How nice! What else did you buy? - We also bought a new chimney! - Wow you've done so much today! Hi, dad. Hi, sweetie. How are you? Oh and we went to the glasses store and had auntie Setareh's broken glasses fixed. You did great! I plugged your mobile phone in the room. - Call your mum. - Sure, thanks. I wanted to buy lionfish for Qelya, but Setareh said you prefer Javelin. We had to look everywhere for it. These are frozen fish. If you want real Qelya, you should come to Abadan. - Auntie! - Yes, sweetie? You should taste dad's Qelya! It's excellent! Really? He knows that kind of stuff too? I only remember him eating my share as well! Don't leave the hair dryer on the floor! Don't worry! Look at this, auntie Setareh! - Mum? - What is it? Didn't I tell you daddy was going to buy me a scooter? Let's fix it, Shirin. It's so beautiful! It's not like that. Let me fix it. Here. Where was this, honey? Daddy has left it on my bed. Is he back from the trip? Come here, Shirin! Now turn around. I've got a friend called Zahra in my kindergarten. The other ones are Karina and Mahsa. One of them has a bicycle and the other one a scooter like this. We want to have a scooter race on Friday. Will you go with me, auntie Setareh? Why the hell did you come by? See how well I scoot, auntie? Didn't I tell you to not come here before our case is settled? Turn off the TV. No one is watching anything. Yes, I told you a thousand times. But why did you come here? Oh my God! Let's play, auntie! What should I do with you, Mohsen? You're driving me crazy. I hear you, damn it! I hear you, Mohsen! I'll pay you at the end of the month. What kind of spices have you got? Why did you pay him? I said why did you pay him? He had bounced checks! So what? I know what I'm doing! Yeah, that's obvious! What is? You think you know better than I do? It shouldn't have come to this, Farzaneh. You're not paying attention to your life. I'm not? So you're going to preach me again? You won! Mohsen wasn't the right man for me! Are you happy now? Was I wrong about that? No, you're never wrong! You're always right! Aren't you tired of that shit, Ahmad? What good comes of you always being rights? What good did it ever do for me? What are you saying? I'm not here to fight! Yeah, I know! know! It's snowing, auntie! Mummy, it's snowing! I know why you're here. You've let go of Samira's party to come after Setareh! Just because she takes after me, it scares you, right? You fear she might end up like me? You know damn too well what you did to me! Are you feeling guilty now? What are you looking for? Look at me! Look at me, Ahmad! You've done nothing wrong in your life? You don't regret anything? Why did everything change after dad died? You changed Did you take good care of me? You just let go of me! Would dad do the same, Ahmad? Why are you being so stubborn, huh? Say you're sorry for once! I'm not saying it for my sake. I'm worried about Setareh! You shouldn't force her into anything. Talk to her! - Leave her out of this. - Leave her out? Come here, Setareh! Come and say what you want, honey. This is your dad, I know he loves you. Don't be afraid to tell her you've got admission for Master's degree. You're afraid he might not allow you to go? Did you know she hasn't even picked the option of studying in Abadan? Did you know that? Huh? Do you want to know why? Why aren't you telling him? Because she wanted to get out of that house! Talk to him! Tell him you've been in touch with me. Tell him why you're saying no to all your suitors! Who is not paying attention now? You or me? I was your sister, Ahmad. But you were never supportive of me. You weren't at my wedding. You weren't there when I was alone. Even now that I'm getting a divorce, you're not there for me. You're here for your daughter, not for me. Pay my debts when you come here for my own sake. You can't just show up after 10 years and pay my debts. You've done a lot for us, I know. But I wasn't happy. We could be. Will you play snowballs with me outside? No, I don't feel like it now. Why didn't you talk to him? You were supposed to do that! I picked Abadan too. What? I picked Abadan University in my options too! So what? Does it make a difference? You said I haven't picked Abadan. Well, it must be your last option. Why are you crying? Was I too harsh on him? I feel for him. I shouldn't have talked to him that way. Setareh... No one is like your own family. Subtitles ripped by gooz karagarga, 2020
