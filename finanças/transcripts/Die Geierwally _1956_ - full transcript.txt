The Geier Wally (1956) dTV - BR - 24th August 2012. Bird chirping and bell ringing. Everyone is praying softly. Amen! Amen! (All): Amen! Go on, you want to dance. Thanks, Luckard. Today you are in a good mood. Watch that you get ahead. What about you? Hд? You should get up! Not before I get my schnapps. Today is Sunday. The schnapps. Rumble. Now they are coming! Have something to eat! Did not you eat in the village? Do what I buy you! Where do you want to go? Look after Wally! Put everyone under a blanket, the woman. Melancholic music. Has there been anything, Wally? No. Why did you cry then? Is something for you? Do not look good. You came home so early. Did not you dance? Danced? I just had time to dance! Something happened. Tell me! Maybe I can help you. Nobody can help me. Now go! Leave me alone. Mary and Joseph! Your rosary is torn. Where do you have the corals? Lost. The rosary torn. My God, what will happen? Has everything already happened? Go, leave me alone. I ask you! Dramatic music. Lovely music. A brave act, Josef. We thank, because the Bdr has a lot of problems for us. God commanded! God, pastor. Tell me more! Was he dead right now? I did not hit right. Suddenly he's up to me. I could not load my bucks anymore. Suddenly he was above me. I pushed the knife into his hand. Then I put the break on my hat. Is that for me, Wally? Then I say, Waidmann's thanks. Gelдchter. We want to drink for your hunting happiness, Bievsensef. Now he has his name gone. Wally, there you have your coral again. God bless, Joseph. Your father has already gone home. You should follow right away. Why then? We wanted to eat here. He could no longer hear the boastful fuss from the Jager. Damn, that you do not have time. Would you have danced with me? Gladly. But I have to go home. Then another time. We have to go. We? I find my way alone. Where is the Vincent? I do not need his company. But I got it! I do not like Vincent. Who do you like? Maybe the hunter, the starvation? Yes. He pleases me. I feel that he likes me, too. Now it's enough for me. So you can feel what it's like to think about that bastard again. Gentle music. Do I want to know what you did to your daughter, farmer? I would like to know what that means to you. I have represented her at her mother's position. You taught her to be stubborn like a mule. A mule is only stubborn if it is mistreated. Do not dare too much! Happy music. Look at that, the highest farmers Wally! A wild girl, the Wally. Wally! Shall come to the father! What does he want? Just go in! So agreed! It remains. What is it, father? The Vincent wants to marry you. He has my word. Next month is wedding. You've known for a long time that I like you. But I do not like you. I can not become your wife. Why? Your father has given me the yes-word. I will not give it back. I will not let myself be forced. That you know. Father, I do not want Vincent. Did I ask you if you want? I say it unsolicited. I'll also tell you to marry him without asking. Get out of here! I mean, I have a say too. I am not a livestock that has to be sold if the farmer wants to. The child belongs to the father, as good as a calf or a steed. Who says that, father? (Screaming): It's in the Bible! The Bible only says that we should honor and love our parents. You only give me to the Vincent, so that I can not take Joseph. I love. You take Vincent! And if I had to beat you into the church. At the altar I say no. You follow! Or it takes a bad end between us. A bad end has already taken between us, father. You have no heart for me. And I feel nothing for you anymore. You are just as dear to me as the Murzoll glacier above. So? The glacier is as dear to you as your father. Then go to the Hochalm, there you are close enough to him. You'll stay up until you've got your bearings. That's how long you can not stretch your feet out from under my desk. It's right, father. Music. Do not think too hard about your father's house, Wally. Father's house? Come, Lorenz! I'll make sure you come back soon. Luckard, the farmer is calling for you. Yes. Luckard! Where do you stay so long? The Wally... Is she gone? As you wanted it. It will already remember. Not. That's just like you. Bring me the stuff to rub in! Connect my foot! Your unclothed rage in your age rubs me in and shut up! It's a shame what you do to the Wally. That does not concern my servants. Me already. I raised her. The little love that she has experienced, she has from me. And insanity too. You did that alone. Just as happy with the farmer. Dare to say that again. Because it's true. You have no heart in your body and no mind. You only know yourself! Music. God, God! God, God! Wally, where are you going? On the high alp. Greetings, Wally. What are you doing here? The father has bought it. Why? Because I should judge everything, until the sheep come up. That could have been done by a maid. That's pointless. I like to do it. Everything in life makes sense, says Luckard. Yes, even the blatant. But I visit you, is it you? That's right, Josef. I'm happy for that. Then Waidmannsheil. Waidmannsdank. Pfuat di! Well, Josef. That would be a mess for you. I thought so too. A hunter is nothing with her father. Did you see the vulture they have in their backpack? I did not pay attention. The wall is over there. It's because of the young vulture sitting in the nest. He has to starve. The poor creature. Music. Why did not you follow the father? You can not get against that. Me, yes. It's wet and cold. Icy cold. No, Wally. So alone in this wilderness! Before you go down, you have to show me the vulture test. Would you like to dig it out? You can not go there. If I had the young vulture, I could take care of him. And would not be so up here alone. Just try it! Then you do not have to worry about anything anymore. Then you lie down in the wall. You, Wally. What is it, Lorenz? I wanted to tell you that You do not need to worry. I do not feel sorry. My only. If the Blessed Fraulein should come to you once. I do not feel sorry. They help you rather than that they do something to you. Believe me! GruЯ you, Hochstbauer. Greetings. Come here! Take a seat next to me! Is it true that the Wally is up to the Murzoll glacier? Yes, it is true. When will she come down again? As I know Wally, not for a long time. Do you ever have to visit. You can speak out. That's impossible. There she can crash again. Keep me up the sheep! That can freeze there. She thinks something. More important, you have to take care of the yard. It will be your yard once. I can barely get up with my foot. Whistles of the wind. Exciting music. Lorenz! Lorenz! I'm coming, Wally. Now you have enough wood for a long time. Menacing music. Do not you want to wait for the fog to clear. I know the way and your father. He ordered me to come down again today. Think about it, if it would not be better to go down with me today. It's terrible there for you. And so alone. I do not feel sorry. Yes. You have the devil in your body. No, Lorenz. Only a strong love. Stay healthy, Wally. Greet me the Luckard! Come soon the sheep up! Exciting music. The wind whistles. Lorenz! Echo reverberates. She hears her echo. Lorenz! The name echoes many times. (Screaming): Lorenz! Multiple echo. Dramatic music. Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha! She screams. Menacing music. She laughs loudly. Echo of laughter. Dramatic music. Whistles of the wind. Joseph! Did you bring her up well? Well, yes. But... But what? She is sorry for me, because she has to live there alone. We send the sheep up earlier. The farmer does not allow that. Could it break one thing. The cattle go to him over the person. Do not you have any work! Look, you're going to make wood. You can not use something else. Yes, does he have anything to talk about here? Of course, the farmer has put him in the yard. He lets his own flesh and blood live in snow and fog. Exciting music. Fiepen and Gackern. Cheerful music. Joseph. You have to get ready. The hunter wants to drive today. What? I still have holidays! I wanted to visit someone I promised. 3 months hunting in Kärnten. I want to go immediately. Can not do anything. Host! Bring me a glass of wine! Equal. To the horror. The boy drives the sheep. Grate me the Wally! Yes. Bimmeln the little bells. Blцken. What's going on out there? The sheep are driven to the high alp. What? Now? Did the Vincent buy that? Yes. Good Morning. Did you buy the sheep to be raised? No. I can not sleep any more since I know Wally alone up there. I do not want to share in your sin. I bought it! As long as the yard is, so long we have the resistance in the house. I still need it. Who else will take care of me? How you mean. In 14 days, my sheep are also raised. There you can visit your bride. Your hut is close to ours. Cheerful music. Blцken. A man yodels. Echo reverberates. Joseph! Greetings, Wally. You are s! Did you expect someone else? It's not bad that my bride lives in such a dog kennel. Your bride? Of course. Your dad lets you ask if you have enough of your own. And want to do your duty. Did you come for that? Not extra. I have fed my pasture. And wanted to stop by. There, that sends you the Luckard. That's what I'm telling you, God bless it. When are you going to the valley? Do you want to get rid of me so soon? From me you can stay as long as you like. Drьben! In your own hut. Why are you always so harsh to me? I'm going to love you. You are promised to me. If you do not want, I'll take what's mine! Do not get too close! What do you want against me? No one hears you scream. Let me go, you dog, you coward! Buzzing. I'll pocket the skull if you do not go. Go! You've got a clean society there. Blцken. Geierwally! Sad music. Wally is the heiress of the farm. It's not that far yet. You still refuse Wally her inheritance! There is no talk of heritage. Vincent behaves like an heir. I bought it for my future Eidam. What you do to your daughter is a sin and a shame! How do you talk to your employer? It has to tell someone! Walburga does not hear up there. If the girl dies, I scream out that you killed her. With your evil and hard sense. Go! And yell already that I threw you out. I served 40 years on your farm. Where should I go now? That's your thing. Look, that you get out of my sight. Greetings, Wally. The Luckard will send you that. She left the yard. Went? She has not left. The farmer chased them away. Guilt is the Vincent. He wants to take away all the old people. The Luckard. Where is she now? At her base in Winterstall. Screech. Ah, there's your vulture! Oh, what do you know about my vulture? The Vicenza told it. He calls you Geierwally. So? The vulture wally. You stay up here, I have something to do downstairs. Up here? I'll be back tomorrow. Come on Hansel, let's go down! Exciting music. Look, the Geierwally! Did you go down again? I'll come when it suits me. She'll look around, she sees Vinzenz playing the Eidam. See the vulture! Seppi, look! Music. Krдchzen. Greetings. Greetings, Lorenz. The Luckard is never in the yard. I know. I feel so bad. I almost can not. I should be able to do that by evening. Who bought it? The Vincent. I bring you wine. Meanwhile, sit down and rest! But if the Vincent... You do what I tell you. Where are the keys? What key? To the pantry. Oha, only slowly. Who are you? The house daughter. The farmer has forbidden to let you in the house! Give the keys! I'm on duty at the supreme farmer. You have nothing to buy me! I'll tell you the keys! Do not have her there. Then get her! Is that worked, you lazy jerk I'm just... As often as I come, you do nothing! Let me out! I am an old... Lorenz screams. I will help you, beat my servant! You hit him hard. Get the Anton and Regine! To help, farmer! Wally killed the Vincent at the end. Help me quickly! What happened? Is he dead? Did Wally do it? You have to be afraid of that. The doctor has to come here. The Luckard did not need a doctor. Now he stirs. Carry him into the room! You fool! So you come back to your father's house! Father's house? I just came for the Luckard. To ask you... After something like that also trump! How can you talk like that? Such a heard imprisoned! Mцrderin! Quiet! In the basement I lock you! No. Do not lock up! For God's sake! Let me go back to the Murzoll! Take her to the basement! Let me go! Or there is a misfortune! Anton, get it! I can not walk! Whoever touches me, I'm scorching! Such a heard imprisoned! The stable is burning! Let them go, we have to clear. Water here! Water! Exciting music. Bucket! Dramatic music. Birdsong. Bells ring. Lord of my life! Who is sitting on the threshold of your house? Praise Jesus Christ. For eternity. Amen. Who are you and how are you coming from? I've got something heavy on my conscience, Highworlds. And you want to confess. I ran away from home. I had a bundle with the valet Vincent. And hit him in the skull. Then I started the barn. They wanted to lock me up. God be merciful to you! So young and so bad. Otherwise I'm not bazs, high gods. But they did it to me. Come in! I could not see how he beat the old man. I've lit the barn so they will not run after me. If that is a sin? Afterwards I do not know how to do it. Like Jesus Christ. Tolerate and wear. If Jesus had everything with him, then he knew why. He wanted to teach the people something. But I! Had I been locked up, nobody would have taken it as an example. But it cost me my life. Would you like to argue with me? Even though all the people condemn you, the Lord forgives you. He sees that your heart is good and righteous. Sometimes the Lord finds a rough carving of good wood. Then he takes the knife and carves the botched human work. Cut a pain into your soul, just think it's God's knife. That smoothes the hard edges. Everything is different with you, as elsewhere, highs. No one has ever spoken to me like that. If I could stay with you? That will not do. What should I do? Drben, in other valleys, you know nothing about your offense. Go and find a service there! I demand that in the service of good people, you keep your wild nature. Will you promise me that? I'll try it. Melancholic music. Well, I could use a maid, but the vulture... Then God bless. Come, Hansel! Come over! Come, Hansel! Get away, you're in league with the devil! Melancholic music. Thunder. Menacing music. Today it's raining down again. Rattling. What was that? Jessas! There is someone. A girl. Come on, grab it! The wind whistles. Rain pattering. How could she have gotten lost to us? Do you know her? No. Thunder. Who likes to be that? A tramp. That's not how she looks. A decent Dirn does not prowl around at night. Go to! It does not feel like a young boy! The girl must be ashamed. Go out! Thunder. Music. You, outside is a vulture. He seems to be quite tame. A vulture? Then we know who we have in the house. The vulture wally. Barking. You, who does Gelump belong to? The mountain guide Benedikt Rofer. He talks to the farmer. That he hugs! He does not look timid. That will cost you dear, Hofer. The law is on my side. And if I go to the governor! Do not let in the gendarme and the clerk, where's that? With me already. The Roferhof has an ancient right of asylum. The true me. And if the Governor himself came! Are you not ashamed to make me the darling of the people? That's why I come. Give it up yourself and leave your gag in peace! Then she should never come to my eyes! She should never be seen again in our valley! The Roferhof is far away from your community. I think she can go to hell. Well, is not it? Yes, good. Wally! What is it, Leander? Benedict went to your father. I hope he leaves me alone. I want you to always stay with us... Stay with me. What's up? Nothing. The highest farmer leaves the Wally alone. So she can stay with us. I know why you are so interested. Wally does not want to know about you. But of you maybe. You want me out of the house. You wanted to go to St. Leonard. You'll like that. I will stay! Wally! I have to talk to you. I was with your father and... I know. I heard everything. All the better. Then I do not need to talk that long. We just want you to stay with us. Choose one of us! Then your father can not hurt you anymore. I know, you mean well, Benedict. But I have one, I can not get it out of my head. I can not take another. Do not bother with the thought of me! I would be happy here if I could forget the other one. Is not it worth it to you, what are you going through for it? If he knew, he'd be worth it for me. He does not even know? You are one of special wood. It will be best if I am out of the house again. You are so good to me and I'm just bringing disunity between you. I will not let you go. You should not go begging. Then go to our alp. That's what I tell you, God bless you! Watch out! Can you still walk, Afra? It has to stop. You'll make it down to there. You can rest on the mountain pasture. Come over! Tinkling of the cowbell. Blцken. Hey! Hey! Take off your shoes and lie down! Yes. I asked you too much. I'll see if anyone is there. Cowbells ring. Wally! Joseph! Do not you want to come in? Gladly. Happy music. Who is this? Look, now she fell asleep. It's a hard way over there. She comes to the Lammwirtin in southern Germany. But that you are up here! There is something about sending your child into another service. Of course you have acted accordingly. So? Do you know that? Everyone knows that you have beaten the Father over the skull. Do you know why I beat him and work with strangers? No. How should I know that? If you do not know it, do not talk either. So tell me, if you think I'm doing you wrong. Hey, you should say that. I was not there the whole time. I was in hunting with the hunting gentleman. That's why I could not visit you, back then on the Hochalm. So? Why? She woke up. Oh, I fell asleep right. Do you know who we are with? At the Wally vom Hochstauer. At the Geierwally? Did you already hear from me? There, drink one to the shock! God bless you! If you are seen like this, you do not want to believe that you are so angry. Are you feeling better, Afra? Yes, Josef. Then it's right. Screech. Jessas! What's this? This is the vulture of which I have my name. That's a state guy. Screech. What do you think, Hansel? He notices the hunter. Angry screeching. Hansel, go here! Screech. Joseph! Let him out! Give me a knife! Hansel! If I had my book, I would shoot him. What can the bird do for it? You are a stranger. How can you keep such a livestock! No one likes me. Hansel is the only thing I have. You have a beautiful treasure there. Jessas! What about your hands? I connect you. That can do Afra. We're leaving, Afra! Do not you want to take another snack? I lost my hunger. I do not believe what people are talking about. I feel it, you are good. God forbid you! Thanks for the shelter. Sad music. (Screams): Get out of here! Go away! I can not see you anymore! (Weeping): He was finally here. He finally came to me. And you drove him away. Why do not you like him? You know how much I like him. Oh, Hansel! What have you done to me? What do you want? I... I should tell you... Maybe I should come home? That I should ask my father what they made of me? Tell him to leave me alone! Your father is dead. Hцchstbдuerin. Bell is ringing. It did not go long. My condolences. Bьrgermeister. My condolences. My condolences, Dowager. My condolences. My condolences too, Wally. Thank you. If you need comfort, Wally, you know where to find me. Thanks to the Muh, Highworlds. First, I have enough to do in the yard. For the poor of the community. Oh! Thank you, Dowager. My condolences, Dowager. I am always the Wally for you. Thank you, Benedict. Well, now you have become the mistress of many servants. Learn to obey, child, so that you can command. There is no one left who has something to tell me. But. The god. Do you still remember what I told you about the good Lord? Who can carve a saint out of a knotty piece. I want to think about it when I look at it. God bless you! Wally, I... I thank you for coming, Joseph. Degree today. I was so sorry for you up there. And I was also rude to you. I did not want that. That's fine. Is forgotten. The Afra scolded because we did not thank us. Wally! That was not necessary. I also want to say my condolences. Thank you. Drive to! Hьh! What has she suddenly? I do not know. You can not talk to him sensibly. Chicken cackle. Are you sending us away now, Butterin, because we were so angry with you? We had to do what the farmer bought. I do not send anybody away. Except he is dishonest or bad on duty. Go to your work! Lorenz, I have an assignment for you. Get Luckard home! Wool, wool. Wally! You treated me badly, but... If I wronged you, God may punish me for it. I do not ask you to forgive me. I do not want to see you here anymore. Is that thanks? For what I did for your father. I do not want to owe you. Demand a piece of land or money! But get out of my sight! Wally! I'll do everything for you. You want to feed me with money? I like nothing but you. Brass music. Shot. 10! Just like the Josef! Elimination shots between Feuersinger Josef and Buchinger Xaver. 11! Buchinger, now you have to show what you can do! 11! A new knockout between Josef and Xaver. Now shut up, Bdrenjosef! 12! Degree like his father blessed. Bravo, Josef! Bravo! 10! Should live Bdrenjosef! (All) Bravo! Brass music. Wally! For you, I am the highest farmer. Not the Wally. I did not want to offend you. One like you can not insult me. What do you mean by that? One who throws himself at the man's images. Do you mean to insult a poor girl just because you are wearing silk? Who would have thrown me by the neck? The Josef. He almost had to carry you from the Roferalm. In the tavern they have been bawling because of you. That's disgusting of you. Come here, Afra! Be calm. This is jealousy because Josef does not care about them. Jealousy? Ha! He's more comfortable with that than with one he'd have to conquer. Greetings, Josef. Clean you have shot. Honorary property! I'm looking for someone The High Dairy is already gone. After she insulted Afra. Offended. Why? She'll throw herself at you. She scolded Afra for the degree. Where is the Afra? Home Gone. Come on, Josef! The hunter asks for you. She should get to know me! For whom did I put it all on? But only for him. I do not need the gelump. Wally, remember! Come to me! She sighs. It was not right what you did there. If Josef finds out! Understand me, Luckard. What I did all! For months. Alone. In the wilderness on the Hochalm. Everything for him. Everything for him. And now I'm supposed to lose him to those. I became a maid for him. I have humbled myself for it. Gelt, Luckard, you understand me? You alone. And the Hansel. I told him a hundred times how much I love Josef. Rustle. If the weather stays that way, we can drive in the hay tomorrow. If you go ahead like a man, it can not be missing. People are already talking about you. Come on, vespern. I do not answer to anyone. Take it! Here comes the messenger from the south. Is that coming to you, Mirl? He makes the advertiser. Eat something with us! Do you want to go far? I want you, Dowager. To me? The fire saver Josef sends me. He lets you play the dance in the next Sunday. You should answer me. I thank Josef for the honor. Tell him I will come. Cheerful music. I thank you, dear Lord, that you have turned everything for the better. I doubted, but now I know that you do not forget anyone. The farmer is not finished. She is getting ready for Josef! You're beautiful, Bäuerin. I am so happy about you. Drink a wine on Josef and me! God bless you! Ascends! There, eat and drink. Thank you, Bäuerin. But we are fine. Hьa! That a bloomer from a ray of sun blossoms so! Brass music. Greetings, Wally. GrьЯ you, Vincent. Watch out, they're up to something with you! But go! You invited me to dance. I am here. Music! Solo for the High Dairy! Flourish. But before you dance, you have to give me a kiss. But not there, in front of everyone. Degree there. In front of everyone. I'm not going to give myself that cheaply. Yes but... A right-wing hunter shoots his game differently than in flight. Defend yourself! If you want it that way, I'm fine. Gelдchter. You are beautiful. As beautiful as you are. Is already done. You have won, Josef! Laughter and voices. So. Now you have seen it. Next I want nothing. What did I see? I'll take it with you. Like a bender. Remember it! If you want to hang shame on a decent girl, like the Afra. A blow for the fire-Singer Josef! Flourish. Brass music. Come on, Wally! Dance with me! Yodel. Yodel. Do not take it so much to heart! I am still there. Everything is gone. Say what you want! Dead I want him. That can not be serious! This is serious. He who marries Josef to his Afra in front of the chamber, I marry. GrьЯ you, half way! GriЯ you, lamb hostess! Well, Josef gave it to Geierwally today. What happened? He has embarrassed her in front of everyone. Why then? Because she scolded you so much. She has done right. But Josef! What did you do there again? I promised my brother, your father, to stand up for you. That's how I thought it was today. It was just her jealousy. If it hurt me, I forgot. She loves you. It has already happened. I'm almost sorry. My God! How can you make amends now? I beg your pardon. Immediately. God commanded, Joseph. Sad music. Yes, just laugh! Do sacred! You hear no prayer and no curse. You are a piece of wood. Shot. Joseph! Nonsense! Shot. Vincent! Vincent! Did you shoot? Yes, he lies in the river. The Josef? Do not scream that loud! Say it is not true! I've done everything just for you! Let me go! Assassin, cowardly! Did not you buy it? Sometimes you say something in anger. Maybe he is still alive! Open, it happened a misfortune! Do you want to take us to the gallows? Help! It is an accident! The Josef is located in the Ache. Bell is ringing. Exciting music. That's his hat. He has to lie down there. Help! Did you hear? That's him, he lives! Dramatic music. Joseph! Can you hear me? He never answers. Maybe he is unconscious. I have to go downstairs. Without rope? I'm getting off this way. You are not clever. Get the ropes! Exciting music. Get the fire department! I follow her. Dramatic music. Joseph. Rope down! (Screaming): Rope down! Noise and music. Dress now! Attract! Stop! Slower! For God's sake! Sad music. Joseph! Sob. Praise Jesus Christ. For eternity. Amen. Leave us alone! Thank the Lord that you have no murder on your conscience. I know everything. The valet Vincent was on his run with me. He confessed everything to me. So far you have brought it so. You've become a raw firewood to kill people with. Yes, Highworlds. When Joseph dies, I jump down into the Ache. I like to hear that. Eliminate one deadly sin with the other. What else can I do but die? Sons you can. That's more than dying. I'll try it. You've already told me that once. But not kept. This time I'll hold it, Highly. Stцhnen. If only the doctor came. He does not seem like a dying man. Who brought him up? - I. - You? God help me! How did you do that? I went down, found him, and then we roped him. I let him down, so I have to catch him up again. That's not cheap. Nevertheless, it is a sweetie. And take some of the guilt from your soul. There is nothing to look at for the curious. How did that happen? I do not deserve it. But let your mercy be greater than my fault! Josef stays in the yard until he is well again. Anton is traveling by car. The Afra will be there soon. I'm leaving now. You'll be back, Wally? When he gets well, yes. Help Afra to take care of Joseph! Look, that he is lying high with his head! Take the old, fine canvas from the chest to connect! God forbid! Sad music. A sheep is bleating. You must always go where it does not go. Just like me. Screech. A man yodels. Music. Blцken. He yodels. Wally! Do you want to run away from me? Wally, I'll come get you. It was bad of me what I did to you. I wanted to see you and then the Vincent caught me. To me did you want? Yes. Let me! I ask you! What is wrong with you? Everything is fine. You do not know, Josef, it was me. I know everything. The Vincent will come back. I only loved you. And would rather die than take another man. But you have spoiled me for all kindness and faithfulness. Since it has reversed. Just had sorrow. That's the end of it now. Do you want to be my wife? And the Afra? She never stood between us. Screech. Krдchzen. Hansel, you must love Josef now. He belongs to us. He flies away! He is like me. He can not share what he loves. Cheerful music. Subtitles Studio Rhein-Main OMNIMAGO GmbH
