No, it's broken. You broke it. Oh, hold on. Wait. Where are you going, Liam Page? Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, shit. Okay, well, call me. Can you please tell me where's the nearest cell phone store? It's... Mr. Page, I'd be delighted to assist you. It's on the edge of the Quarter. I'd be happy to call you a car. Will you just tell me how far, which direction, how many blocks? Take a right on Royal, and it's six blocks down - on your left. - Okay. Oh, my. Liam, where are your shoes? Hey, I'll give anyone $10,000 if they can fix my phone. - Ten thousand. - Oh, my God...

Well, it's not going to win any beauty contest, but it should work just fine now. - It's fixed? - Now, I'll give you some privacy and you can check for yourself. Okay. April 9th, one saved message. Hi, Liam, it's me, Josie... Country star Liam Page was spotted earlier today in the French Quarter. He was running barefoot according to some witnesses... Now, Doris, hold on, this might be him. Yeah, I got him. I need an espresso. Oh, espresso? Okay. Okay. How about basic outerwear, huh? Like shoes? Hmm? That little jog of yours is all over TV. Doris has called me like five times. Publicists live for this stuff, Sam. Record labels do not. Not to mention, everyone's wondering when you're going to stop messing around and deliver these new songs you owe them. I'm just... I'm dealing with some writer's block right now. Dude, I'm telling you, you can't keep putting them off. All right, Sam. We have a meeting set with the label... Hold on one second. Oh, crap, it's Blake Shelton. I got to get this. This should be fun. Hey, Blake. What's up, buddy? Terrible accident took place on I-59 this morning. Twenty-seven-year-old councilman Mason Belmont of St. Augustine was driving on his way to a city meeting at approximately 6:30 AM when he was struck by a drunk driver. That driver is said to be in critical condition. Unfortunately, Belmont did not survive. St. Augustine, known by locals as simply Saint, is holding an open vigil at their church tomorrow. This was the third incident this month... All right, buddy, we'll talk soon. All right. Thank you. Okay, Liam, as I was saying, we're going to get this meeting. It's going to be... Where are you going? You're just going to walk... okay. I guess you're just going to go. Great. Get some shoes. A rooftop. You're kidding me right now, Liam? We're supposed to be on a flight to Denver in half an hour. Jeez, look at you, man. All right. I'm going to go get you a clean shirt or something. Just get in the car. ...now, sad news to report, the town of St. Augustine is mourning the loss of one of their own today. 27-year-old Mason Belmont was born and raised in St. Augustine, was killed on Tuesday in a car crash... Hey, Pat, can you turn that up? ...laid to rest this afternoon. A funeral service will be held at St. Augustine Community Church. - Mason leaves behind his wife... - Oh, man. ... and two young children.

I wish I had the answers to help you understand why Mason was taken from us, to help me understand. I think about this church during times like this. Here in this church, I baptized most of you, married most of you, baptized your children. We rejoiced through the good times together and we bonded together during the hard times. So while I wish I had the answers as to why, what I can tell you is this, that it was here inside this church that Mason Belmont sat every Sunday morning with his family with that big smile on his face. How blessed were we to have had the privilege of experiencing that smile that Mason bestowed upon us through the grace of God. Jake, can you take Billy to the car, please? Just leave him be, Jos.

You know, with some soap and water? You still know how to wash dishes, don't you, Liam? Right here. What happened to Mom's rose garden? Well... I just couldn't keep up with it. So I'll be back around 6:00 tonight. You're just going to leave right now? Well, I'll make us some supper when I get back, if you're still around. I'm not sure how long I'm going to be here for so... Right. I mean, do they have Uber here or... How else am I supposed to get around, Dad? I think your old bike's still in the garage. Get out of the pool, come on, let's go, let's go. Have you completely lost your flippin' mind? I mean, you pulled a lot of crap on me, but you never missed an entire concert, Liam. - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? Oh, that's good. All right, that's good. Babe, would you get the kids? I just don't want them to hear this. Liam, you missed the whole concert, okay? That's 20,000 fans and me, and Doris, and the label, all wondering why Liam Page isn't at the concert these people paid good money to see him play at. I mean, do you have any idea how much this costs, a tour? I'll pay them back. Oh, you'll pay them back. You'll pay them back. Oh, man, you just don't get it, do you, buddy? Okay. You know right now, the whole world is wondering where Liam Page is, yeah. Have you turned on a TV? Does that prehistoric cellphone of yours even have Wi-Fi? I'm in my hometown right now, in Louisiana. My best friend from high school passed away. I just went to his funeral. Liam, I'm so sorry, man, I mean, are you all right? - Yeah, I think so. - Okay. Well, I just want you to know I'm going to get everything set on this end, all right? I mean, that was your last concert date on that tour, so we'll just set Denver up after we go to Europe on the next tour. It's all going to be fine. You just... you just be with your friends and your family. And look, and Doris, I mean, Doris started spinning some crazy story about why you missed that concert. So don't even worry about it, all right? Hey, Sam, where are my credit cards? Why? I mean, I've never seen you use your credit cards by yourself before. I just... I want to buy a few things, that's all. All I have is the cash in my pocket. Okay. All right. Yeah, I'll overnight them. Thanks, Sam. All right. Can I get a car? Just text me your address. Now speaking of crazy, there's Doris. All right, I got to go, brother, all right. We'll talk soon. Bike it is. Twenty, and there you go. - Thank you very much. - Thank you, sir. Have a good day. - How are you? - Good. - We have more in the back. - Excuse me? More magazines with your face on them. Do you want me to get those for you? No, I'm good, thanks. Lydia. We went to high school together. Right. 24.99, please. So, Lydia, you don't happen to know where Josie lives, do you? No. Or where she works? Thanks for shopping at Ed's. Here you go. That will be 8.69, Mrs. Boudreaux. Okay. Oh, Judy, could you pop into the back and tuck that arrangement for Ms. LeBlanc for me? She's going to come by this afternoon to pick it up. - Sure. - Thank you. Ten... twenty... thirty... forty... fifty... - Hi. - I'm with a customer. sixty. You know, this is such a pretty prayer plant, Mrs. Boudreaux. I think you picked out the best one I have. Thank you, dear. It's for Kiera. That is so thoughtful of you. I just adore truly thoughtful people. Seven, eight... Thank you, ma'am. Now why don't you let me help you out to your car. Hi there, Mr. Boudreaux. Hey, Josie. Let me get that for you. Thank you. Now, you all have a nice day. We sure will, dear. Idiot. That was quite a punch you socked me with yesterday. That was just a warning shot. - Yeah? - Uh-hmm. So this is where you work. I own it. I bought it after Mrs. Quinn passed five years ago. Wow. Yes, Liam, I actually did something with my life after you walked out on me. And yes, a lot of people in this town have come and gone since you were last here. My mama passed away. Do you even know about that? No. I'm so sorry, I had no idea. Have you noticed that in the past eight years no one and, I mean, no one in this little town of ours has ever spoken to the press about you or your life here ever? Have you also noticed that no one's taken a picture of you, posted it on Facebook, Instagram, nothing? Now, why do you suppose that is, Liam? Because I walked out on you. Liam, it's because you left us all that day, the entire town. No one's spoken about what you did here because we have each other's backs here in Saint. We're a family. We're loyal. But you don't belong here anymore, Liam. Please just leave. Hey, Mama. Hi, sweetie. Oh, my... How was your day at school? You know, the usual, nothing special. Hello, Liam. - Laura. - You know what? Laura is going to take you all out for some cupcakes at the diner, my treat. Actually, it's on me. Let's get going, okay? I'm just going to have some soup, no cupcakes. I don't want to spoil my dinner. Oh, that sounds nice. Come on, guys, let's go. Hey, I know you. You were outside the church yesterday. You're that country star my mama listens to sometimes. I mean, I just sometimes have the radio on. - Sometimes. - Not really my cup of tea, no offense. None taken. I'm a... I'm a friend of your mom's. - Liam. - Billy. Billy? Wow. That's a... - That's a really pretty name. - Okay, sweet pea, why don't you get going with Laura, okay? - And I will come up to meet... - Just one little minute. How old are you, Billy? I'm really small for my age and I'm losing my baby teeth much later than everyone else at my age. I mean, they don't even have the tiniest little wiggle yet, but I'm seven. Okay. Cupcake time, let's go. Bye, Mama. Nice to meet you, Liam. Bye, sweet pea. Hey, give yourself okay? Okay. Seven, huh? Well, I guess that conversation that played out a million times in my head is actually about to really happen, huh? Yeah. Yeah, I think it is. I'm going to need a beer for this one. I didn't find out that I was pregnant until a couple weeks after our wedding day... what was supposed to be our wedding day. I was so angry and humiliated after you just walked out on me and yet somehow I mustered up all of the strength that I had left. I called to tell you I was pregnant. Of course it went straight to your voicemail. I left you some long message begging you to call me back. And then I promised myself that if you didn't have the decency to call me back to find out what was so important that I had to tell you... I was never going to contact you again because Billy and I, we deserve better. You named her after my mom, Josie. I did that for your dad, Liam. She loves him so much. We all do. Hey, sis. What are you doing here, Liam? Haven't you put her through enough in one lifetime? Good to see you, too, Jake. You know what, Liam was just leaving, actually. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I was... I was just leaving. - Uh-hmm. All right. Why didn't you tell me, Dad? - Tell you what? - That I had a daughter. Why didn't you tell me about Billy? - I did tell you. - When? What are you talking about? We haven't even... We haven't even spoken since I left. Yeah, exactly. I went to your first concert there in Seattle. Wouldn't return my calls so I had to track you down like some kind of fan, find out where you were performing. You... you were at that show? Yup. I even went backstage to see you after. I had to plead with one of the security guards to let me in to see my own son. And there... There you were. You were so out of your mind on God knows what, I honestly thought I'd stumbled into the wrong room. But even after that, I still tried to tell you about Billy, that you had this amazing daughter on the way. I don't remember any of that. Yeah, you don't? Why don't I refresh your memory? You told me to leave and never come back, although in much more colorful language. So what was I supposed to do, Liam? You were... you were legally an adult. I couldn't force you to come home with me. I was... I was really messed up then, Dad. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you really seem to have it all together now, son. So, good for you. You know what? I just... I don't get it, Liam. You were such a good kid. You were a great son. You were... You were great to your friends, and you were so in love with Josie. What happened to you, Liam? What happened? I don't know. Well, that guy I saw in Seattle that night, I knew that Billy and Josie were just better off without him. So, yeah... yeah, shame on me. ♪ Gone from the eyes ♪ ♪ That were everything ♪ ♪ Gone from those loving arms ♪ ♪ Gone from the hands ♪ ♪ That prayed for me ♪ ♪ And I'm gone with a gift... ♪ Good morning, everyone. Well, you know, it's been a rough time here in Saint. It's been a rough few weeks, and it's got me thinking a lot about mercy and forgiveness. You know, scripture says, &quot;Forgiveness for in love in all love, we must have the capacity to forgive.&quot; You know, to forgive, it sounds so easy in theory, doesn't it? And yet it remains so profoundly difficult to achieve. Trust me, I know. You know, here inside this church, we've always practiced forgiveness, haven't we? So with that in mind, let's try today to forgive those that have hurt us and to move forward. And if we can truly forgive, then we can truly be set free. Let us pray. I think he went out... Liam. I'm glad you're here. Come on, stick around. - Pastor Page. - Hi. Remember Ms. Johnson? Liam. Thank you so much for coming. - Good to see you. - Hi. Thank you so much. - See you in fellowship. - Thanks for Thank you. Hey, I'm so sorry. Come here. Let's go out this way. April 9th, one saved message. Hi, Liam. It's me, Josie. Dad? Sweet. Hi. Hey. I'd like to buy some flowers for Kiera. Okay. Hydrangeas are her favorite. All right. Perfect. I'll get... I'll get 24. Twenty-four? Yes. Please. Okay. This is 12, grab that. Okay. Perfect. Uh-hmm. That will be $187.51. There. Got my own credit card. Congratulations. I want to see Billy. Sign here, please. Look, don't ignore me on... I know that I haven't been a great anything, all right? But I want to get to know her. I'm not going to cause any trouble. It can all be on your terms, but she's my daughter, too, Josie, whether you like it or not. Can I have a little time to think about it? Yeah. Of course you can. Thank you. Yeah. Here. You got a pen for me to sign? You sign it with your finger, Liam. Yeah. I knew that. Do you need help with those? No, I got them. Eight is thirty-two... always try to remember that one. That's a really good one. Do you want me to cut you a piece? - Ready? - Cheers. Mmm! Good, huh? Uh-hmm. So, sweet pea, there is... There's actually something I want to talk to you about. It's about your daddy. I thought you never wanted to talk about him? I did not. But that is not fair to you. You have a right to know your father. But that only is if you want to, because if you don't, that's okay, too. I don't know. He seemed nice to me. The guy from outside the church and the flower shop, right? You two weren't exactly subtle, if you know what I mean. How did you get... Okay. Yes. Now sweet pea, we met when we were very, very young. But it's important that you know that he did not abandon you, okay? He didn't even know that I was pregnant. Yeah. He looked pretty shocked when he saw me. We should invite him over for dinner. Might help him process the news. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. You amaze me, child. Uh-uh, that's my blackberry! Don't you dare eat that, Billy. Billy! - Okay, Maria? - Yes, ma'am. Hey, try Liam. - Of course, ma'am. - Please. Oh, and you know what? Oh, hold that for a second. I want a... I want a Cobb salad, just... I want it with no chicken, no tomato, no cheese, no corn. You know, I'll call it in. I'll call it in because the last time, you messed it up and you got me something with bananas. Yeah. Hello? Liam, it's late, wake up. Yeah, I am awake. - Who is this? - Hello? It's Doris Grossnickle Hines, your favorite lifeline. Oh, hey, Doris. Hey, so guess where I have the paparazzi thinking you are right now? Uh, somewhere in the Caribbean, right? Yes. St. Barts at a rehab for exhaustion. They are on a wild goose chase as we speak. - Great. - So, listen, those pap smears can only run around that tiny little island for so long without figuring out even in their tiny brains that you are not there. So, L-I-am, when am I going to tell the public that you are out of that sexy little rehab? Because your fans are chomping at the bit right now. I'm in my hometown right now, Doris. An old friend of mine passed away. Oh. Oh, that's terrible. I'm so sorry, Liam. But, listen to me, funerals are much better than rehab for playing the sympathy card, so what I want you to do is take as many selfies as you can of yourself in the shower, shirtless, bottomless, I don't care, in the coffin, by the coffin, hugging the corpse. It doesn't... just get these pictures into me and I will get you the cover of People. Yeah. Goodbye, Doris. Liam? Did he just hang up on me? Uh-uh. Uh-uh. This is not good. Hello? I need to buy something, Sam, on the internet. - Are you drunk? - No. I have not been drinking. I... Say if I wanted to buy an espresso machine, how would I... How do I go about doing that? Okay. You Google it and you click buy. Oh, it's... so it's that easy. Okay. All right. Say if I... If I wanted to buy some jewelry or a teddy bear, how would I do that? Okay. What the heck's going on down there, Liam? I mean, you said you're going to be there for a few days, - and... - Yeah, uh... I think I might... I might be staying for a little longer. Okay. Great. So how long are we talking about? Turns out... I have a daughter. What? Shoot. Liam, with a groupie? My ex-fiancée from a long time ago. Um... She's seven, and her name's Billy. Sam? You alive? You... no, yeah, I'm... I mean, wow. Oh, Liam Page is a dad. You think I'm going to be terrible at it? No, no, no, no, no.

She's picking up her kids anyways. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - It's really no problem... No, no, no, I'm sorry. Look, I... My dad's house is like two minutes from here. I think I'll be... I'll be all right. - Okay. - Yeah? Okay. Billy knows how to put that in the car. Okay, that's lucky. So, just pay attention to what she says. You call me the moment you all get home, okay? Yeah. Tell her I love her. All right. Oh, man. Jumping in the deep end, huh? - Yeah. - Car seat and all. - Yeah. - Where is your car? Right here. That's your car? Yeah. What's wrong with it? I don't do convertibles. They're too dangerous. Come on. It'll be fun, no? Do you know the stats in surviving an accident in a convertible? No. No, I do not. Well, they are low, Liam, staggeringly low. Do you wanna know exactly how low? You know what, I'm all right. What about Grampy's car? Maybe... Do you like his car? - Is his car okay? - Yeah. Yeah? All right. Do you know Grampy's... Do you not know his number? Now? Yeah, on the count of three, one, two, hold on, hold on, be careful now, and three. It smells good, doesn't it? - Can I stir? - Yeah. You're going to ruin your dinner with that, you know. Well, sometimes you just got to let go. Take a walk on the wild side. Trust that everything is going to be okay. Is that chocolate chocolate chip? Uh-hmm. I mean, it's the only flavor that matters. You want some? It's pretty good. Hmm? Grampy, is it okay? Um, yeah, half a scoop, all right? Don't ruin your supper. You want to do it, okay. There we go, all right. Now, we're living. Yeah, look at that. That's a mountain, wow. Okay. All right, one big, big bite. Who can take the biggest bite? One, two, three... Whoa, that's a big bite. - Uh-oh, uh-uh. - Oh. Guess what, brain freeze? - Brain freeze. - No! - Brain freeze! - Maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all. No. - One sec. - Oh. - What? - It's going - to ruin her supper. - You should've seen her face, Dad. You should see all this gumbo. Is this yours? I found it in Grampy's closet a while back. Yeah, wow. I have not seen you for a long time. How do you come up with songs to play? Well, the truth is, I have not been very good at it lately, but don't tell anyone. Well, just start playing. Let's see what happens. Okay. All right, smarty pants. What do you want me to write a song about? Something about... right now, here with us. Okay. Right now... here with us. Let's just start with a melody, shall we? That's nice. I like that. Who taught you to play the guitar like that? Well, my mom. My mama did when I was a little older than you, actually. ♪ I always do ♪ Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow... Oh, uh... - You all right there? - Yeah, but grab that towel there. See if you just... Can get this other side. It is pretty heavy. What do you got in there, some bricks? Yeah, a lot of gumbo and it's hot, hot, hot. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - It's all right, yeah. Smells pretty good, Dad. That's a lot of gumbo. Billy? You play the guitar? Nope. No? So, how do you explain what you're doing right there? By watching what you just did. So... you didn't learn it at school, or... Nope. We don't have that at school. Wow, uh... Billy? Yes. How would you like it if I took you to a shop and bought you a guitar of your very own? Why? Yes, yes! Yes? All right. Then it's a date. Hey, sweet pea. How did your day go? I had the best time with you. Thank you so much, Liam. Wow, thank you. Me too. I'll see you tomorrow for guitar shopping. Yeah. So, guitar shopping? Did you know that Billy plays the guitar? - Billy? - Yeah. She just picked it up and started playing. It was like... It was pouring out of her like she'd been playing her whole life. Billy can play the guitar? Yes. That's crazy. I'm sorry, I told her I was going to get her a guitar. Is it okay if we go guitar shopping tomorrow after school? You should come with us until you're comfortable with me and Billy spending time together, obviously. So, you, me, and Billy? Yeah. Nothing's going to happen between us, Liam. I never said it was. - Hey, Josie. - Yeah? Is it all right if I pick you up from work tomorrow? Okay. I'll pick you up in my dad's car. Oh, so she gave you those stats on convertibles, huh?

Okay. There you go. Perfect, like a little burrito. - Okay. - Hey, Liam, can I ask you a question? Yeah, sure. What happened? I mean, why did you leave my mama? Oh, man. Um... Well, the short answer is that I was young and dumb. And that's pretty much the long answer, too. All I can tell you is that... this one night me and your mom were singing in a karaoke bar. We were just goofing around, but as luck would have it, this record exec heard me singing, and he asked me to record a song, and then next thing I know it's all over the radio, and then I'm off on tour, just like that like one big wild tornado. But why didn't you take my mama with you? I wish I did, Billy, really I do. But I... I was so young, I just... I didn't... I didn't know... I didn't know how to handle being famous. I guess I just... I got lost and I got lost for such a long time and I couldn't find my way back. But you find your way back now. You're back, right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm back, Billy. I'm back. - Hey, Liam. - Uh-hmm? Could I... maybe call you Dad? Dad? Yeah, I would love that more than anything, - really. - Uh-hmm. - Okay. - Okay? - Okay. Good night. - Good night. Bye. - You're going to go to sleep? - Uh-hmm. Uh... Billy just asked if she can call me Dad. Yeah. That's a lot of responsibility. Yeah, I know. It's forever, Liam. I know. I'm ready. Okay. Okay. I should probably get inside or something.

Oh, I'm ready. For a date, that is... with the Liam Page. How's Saturday night? Perfect. Better call your people. Let them know you're coming out of that Caribbean rehab.

You got it. You didn't? I did. You want to do it? - Yeah! - Yes? All right. Grampy's in his car, so we're going to just have to walk, I think. Why is my car seat in there, then? I just... I don't know, I put it in there just in case. But I can pick the car up later. - Come on. - No, I'll take it. You'll take the convertible? Yeah. What about all the stats you told me about? Sometimes I got to let go and walk on the wild side, right, Dad? Trusting everything's going to be okay. You are something else, Billy. What kind of... what kind of music you want to listen to?

You got to put the blood on, nice. I don't think it needs too much blood. It needs some blood, I'm going to put some blood on mine. - And then you gotta... - Smear it around.

Hey, it's going to be okay, Billy, I got you. - ...Billy's choking. - All right? Come on. - It's going to be okay, Billy. - Billy? Take a breath. - Take a breath, sweetheart. - Come on, come on. Take a breath, come on. She's not breathing. One more. One more. Come on baby, breathe. Jake, it's not working. - She's not breathing. - I've got it, okay? Jake, you have to do something. Okay. I got this, okay! - Calm down. - Come on baby, breathe. Come on, you got this. Stay with me, Billy Anne, - stay with me. - A couple more, - come on, let's go. - You got this, baby. All right. One more, come on. Julie, give her 10 CCs of epi and push it. Come on, Billy, not yet. Liam, sweetie, would you go get your daddy for me? Liam? Sweetie, I need you to go get your dad. I think he went down the hall. Go get your daddy for me. Julie, just take him to see his dad. I don't want him to see this. Come on, Billy Anne Page, come on, there's still a little more in you, not yet. - Not yet. - Come on, baby, breathe. Come on, you got this. - Come on baby, come on. - Take a breath. - Come on, breathe. - Here comes a big one. Come on. - Squeeze her. There you go, you're good. Oh, my God, you... - Oh, my God. - Let's go. Let's get some water. Let's have some lemonade, okay? Oh, baby. Hey, everybody want some milk? She's all right. She's all right. She'll be just fine. - Mama, I love you. - Here's some lemonade. You okay, honey? - Yeah? - Are you all right? Yeah, let's eat, everybody. Here, drink some more lemonade for Mama.

Well, I only sing in this bar. And you... you weren't old enough to come in here before you left. You know, I used to sing in here with your mom. You used to sing with my mom? Billy and I used to get quite the crowd in here. Man. But it was you she liked playing with the most. She was always so proud of you. That's really nice tonight, Walt. Thanks, Fred. You need a ride? I'm all right. All right, son. Take it easy. How you doing, Jake? Good, Walt. Yourself? Good. You know, I had a feeling you'd be here. Hey, Freddy, - can I get a beer? - Yeah. So you think you're ready to be a dad because you spent a couple of weeks playing house? - Uh-hmm. - No. My little niece was choking and you just sat there, Liam. I mean, she could've died if she'd been alone with you. Man, you got to be on 24/7 when you're a parent, Liam. You think you're equipped to keep that little girl alive every day? Yeah. I ain't going to forget all the bad years that Josie had because of you, right? And I was there for her. I'm the one that got her through them. Josie finally managed to rebuild her life not just for her, but for Billy, too. Because you and I, we both know that you're just going to find some way to mess it up... and it'll destroy them. You might have everyone else in this town fooled right now, but... you ain't fooling me. I can't believe you smashed your hand through that bar mirror. I'm almost done. You'll be able to play again in no time. I never want to play again. Now, don't say that. Don't say that. It's a God-given talent to be able to play and sing the way you do. I don't deserve it. Let's face it. Just be honest. I'm a bad person, Dad. - Liam. - Come on, it's okay. It's true. We've... we've all forgiven you, son. You shouldn't have. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I left you. I'm sorry that I didn't get in touch with you. Honest, I don't know why I did it. I know. I know. The further away I went... the longer I was gone... the more pain I was in, Dad. I'm sorry. I know you are. I just didn't know how to get out. I know. You know, when your mom died, son, I was so stuck in my own grief... somehow I overlooked yours. I got comforting words for everyone in this town during their time of need but... I wasn't able to talk to my own son during his. That wound, that terrible wound, losing your mom the way you did at such a young age. I think being famous just fed that pain, knocked down everything in its path. So I'm the one who's sorry, Liam. I'm so, so sorry.

Just get me out of here, Sam. It doesn't matter, please take your... Liam, why are you doing this to yourself? What? What the heck happened while you were home? She almost died because of me. Who? Billy. Man, we were... We were all about to have dinner in the backyard and Billy started choking and I just... I froze, man. I was paralyzed by it. I'm not... I'm not a fully formed human being, Sam. I'm just not. Liam, you froze with Billy because you love her. She could've died, Sam. But she didn't die, Liam. And look, we all mess up sometimes, Liam, but it's what you do after you mess up that counts. You show up, you be there. Now, you know what? This whole time I managed you, you ain't been nothing but a big, fat idiot. - You know that? - Yeah. Yeah, it's true. And I get it. I do. There are far better men than you out there, no doubt.

You know that we are supposed to leave right now, so we are going right now into the air. Can you just ask the pilot to open the door? You tell the pilot that you are locking the doors - and we are taking off. - I need to get off this plane. You are not getting off this plane. I'm getting off this plane. You are performing in Berlin in 14 hours. In 14 hours, I'm going to be in Louisiana. - All right. - For the love of God, do not get off this plane. April 9th, one saved message. Hi, Liam. It's me, Josie. I've called you so many times I've lost count. I still don't know why you left me on our wedding day, and I don't know if I'll ever find out. But I really need you to call me back. If you don't, I promised myself that I'll never call you again. I have to find some way to move on with my life. But I want you to know if I don't ever hear back from you, I will always love you, Liam. You will always be the one for me. And you'll have my heart forever. Hey, it's Josie. Leave a message. Hey, Josie. It's me. It's taken me eight years to return this message. I mean, I always wanted to, but I knew that I needed to know how to tell you why I did what I did. And I haven't figured it out... until now. See, my mom was the love of my life until I met you. And... I know we were young but the thought of possibly losing you one day the way that I lost her... I thought my heart couldn't take it, so I ran. But I can never move on, Josie. And that message that you left me, I did listen to it. I listened to it every day for the last eight years. And then when I met Billy, my heart just burst open. I thought I wasn't good enough for you two. But I'm gonna spend the rest of my life trying to be. I'm never leaving Saint again without you and Billy by my side. Josie! Josie! You're the one. You've always been the one. So you've been carrying around this old beat-up, duct-taped, really ugly cell phone the past eight years because of me? Yeah. And you really listened to that message every single day since I left it there? Yeah. And you're not ever leaving Saint again without Billy or me? Never. Then I just wanted to say... welcome home. Hey, I'm Jake. Hi, I'm Doris. Well, it's nice to meet you, Doris. You smell good, Jake. Yeah, woo. Go, Billy. Yeah. - Woo. - Woo, Billy. Woo. Everyone, you all know my dad.
