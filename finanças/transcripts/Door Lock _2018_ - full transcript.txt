So all this time people trying to get into your house and stalking you is him? The stalker is your boss in the office? This... Me too... Is he your girlfriend? Sorry? So, most of the reports stalking that we received the edges are the culprit is your own boyfriend. You don't have a boyfriend? - Hey ... - Why? Shucks. Next time you ask. Come in! What is the number? 1784. This kind of thing is not supposed to be the police who was told to come here but boyfriend. Are you angry? Drink 3 in 1 coffee? Tired, huh? Last night I stayed up late. It feels like it's going to be dull, dead. Although tired, the edges we have to confirm again. According to your testimony ... ... you leave the house and call 112. At that time there were people who kill Kim Seong Ho. So? Based on the evaluation of the crime scene, in your room there were also traces of fighting with third parties. Jo Gyeong Min-ssi ... You should look in the direction the person who is talking. Why not look at me? Look at me! There is a former fight with third party. In other words... In your residence there are still others. The person who killed Kim Seong Ho. Could it be the person you know? Said the door number of your house he knew from the guards in the lobby. Because he said your wallet is left behind in his car. Why are you doing this? Sorry? Everything is on display clearly. You accuse other people kill Kim Seong Ho. You yourself report the police. Pretending yourself to be a victim. Who? I think in your house there are many male products. There is already news from the forensic team. He said he didn't meet. Isn't it in Kim Seong Ho's blood found any drug composition? Certainly which bastard is there in that woman's house finish off Kim Seong Ho. Jo Gyeong Min who is beside him inject drugs. Never mind. I also hope like that in order to punish him. But from before he had start reporting the police. He said there were people who secretly wanted to enter his house. If it's before tomorrow morning the anesthetic still not found, free the person. The head office there says ... New Gwajang next week will start serving here. As information. Your heart is not too worried. Everything is upbeat! Sorry. Gyeong Min-ssi ... We chat for a while.

Oh, your contract ends this month right? Gwajang-nim is a good person. So. It is unfortunate. Until now I am still feel hard to believe. Gyeong Min-ssi doesn't seem to be participating to the funeral? I don't seem to see it. He said he was detained continuously at the police station. Treated like a murderer. The perpetrator of the murder? It's scary. Very scary. Park Daeri doesn't know inside information. You don't understand the situation at all. Where can I call it murderer? Your words seem rather outrageous. Eonni, why? Sit down Eonni! Eonni! - Jo Gyeong Min! - Hyo Joo-ssi.

No need to discuss this first. But inside the house nothing at all. Do you want to check there together? Jo Gyeong Min, don't lie! You really don't see the person's face? Hey, he just almost died. Where do you have the guts to see people's faces? If it's you, can you see that person's face clearly? Agassi, don't talk about problems color sports shoes or something. You must be able to give clearer evidence. I can only do something. The cellphone dies so it can't tracked its location. Are you sure your cell is missing? He hears directly if he lives on Under that person is the next target. Ah ... his hand ... ... wearing a watch. Damn! Then I'm the killer? See! Anu ... it's very old. The model is very popular first.

[Banmal - B. Korean non-formal] You always follow Jo Gyeong Min-ssi. That day why you can arrived at the doorstep of Jo Gyeong Min-ssi's house? Shucks! I went there because of emotions. Because of emotion. Nongol wearing a suit. With style as if he were that A prince. After he appeared with the imported car, the woman's style took cover behind her really makes me disgusted. I went there because I wanted to finish off they both. Satisfied? Turn down your voice, motherfucker! It's true I went there. But not long after I'm going home. I go home on foot. = Come on, drink a cup of coffee. = = Let's just say we help each other. = Take a look at this. The victim was put in a garbage bag and thrown to the roof upstairs. You don't feel weird? Why should the body be thrown onto the roof? You don't feel weird? Why did you ask like this to me? Help me I ask you because I don't know. Maybe you want to show it To people. What do you show? Next is you. More or less. You suspect me. But I'm not the type of crazy person who kidnaps then sawing them into pieces. This ... turned out to be cut with a saw. I'm a carpenter. Use a knife or ax won't can cut this part. You have talked about tools used to kill with that person? Not. But your watch is used to start from when? Pretty good! Beggar style, beggar style. God damn it! Don't arrest innocent people and talk about useless things. Bitch in the bank how dare you play with me. Is he watching from behind? Hey! If I leave this place, just watch you! Understand? = What are you doing? = - You will die! - Sit! You know what's the most make me angry? I was scared until my body became stiff and unable to do anything. I was very angry with myself like that. When that person killed the woman, so scared I could only hiding and not daring to speak out. Can't bear any story to the police. When you come running, I can't do anything because it's too trembling. I'm so stupid like that. I was so stupid that I got emotional. This isn't Eonni's fault, okay? You are tired of waiting. Here, let us be responsible answer to solve it. You go home and rest. That's right, man, right? Yes, basically you can certainly so. You could say he's already admit it from his own mouth. He has a criminal record related to violence. As long as it can be identified at TK Seong Hye's scene, and finding his fingerprints is arguably certain. Last time when the police reported, don't you suspect me? You said I did it. Ah, that's because ... ... suspect everything is diseases caused by our work. Not intentionally. Sorry. What if he is released? If that person is due to lack of evidence and is released like me. This is the last cardboard, right? Yes, troublesome. Place it slightly inward. This is the key. Pretty fast already find a place to live. Yes, fortunately. God damn it! Already done? = Not yet. = = Eonni, we have to eat jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk here! = = Want me to go there? = Now it can't.

Why did he move house without tell the family? Basic! Then you just call him. The cellphone is not active. So I can come here. I was ordered by his Eomm Gyeong Gyeong. Have me hurry up and find him. Who knows, he moved? Because of that you ... Quickly let me know. But why is the sachon oppa who was told to come here? [Sachon oppa - cousin's brother] His Eomm Gyeong Gyeong is in Daejeon. I live in Seoul so I was told to come here. These people really ... If you don't tell me the transfer company may also. We comply with regulations. After all there was an incident unpleasant happens. Then continue ... If something happens to Gyeong Min's Appa, can you be responsible? The key is only one set. Next time there is a chance make a duplicate. - Thank you. - You are welcome.

We keep watching him. If I get there faster ... Gyeong Min-ssi may not be necessary experience an event like this. Sorry. What is the video call? Shit is ... smart brain. He uses Oh Hyo Joo-ssi's computer and record the event first. Then use the cellphone Oh Hyo Joo-ssi made a video call to Gyeong Min. If you can be more cool-headed, you will realize it. What? How can it be seen Oh Hyo Joo-ssi when I go home from work. Which shows that on when he came home. If so, where is this possible is hapoo Oh Hyo Joo-ssi? This is common sense. For this Hyeongsa-nim called common sense? The common sense I know is ... Events like this happen to friends, you will immediately run to him regardless of everything. This is common sense. Then what will happen to Kim Gi Jeong? The proof has been found. Equipment bag inside the video has been found. It was found there Kim Gi Jeong's fingerprint. The hammer and saw were also found. The DNA test results that come out are appropriate, he will be arrested immediately. Do not worry. Eonni. Already up? Are you here today too? Why not go home? Are you a little better? How is your condition? The doctor said I had to be hospitalized this week it's only allowed to go home. He said the operation was running with success. Sorry, Hyo Joo. Don't cry, Eonni. Because of you and Gwajang-nim ... I really don't remember anything. Just sleeping a few days! The doctor said ... The operation is successful and won't leave any marks. Eonni, you better look in the mirror. Eonni looks much more gloomy than me. Yes huh Don't cry. Also do not need to feel guilty. Because of me, because I was then ran crashing into the person.
