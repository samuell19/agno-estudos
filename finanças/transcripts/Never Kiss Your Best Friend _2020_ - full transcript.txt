Hey. Anything urgent? I was kind of in the middle of something. You can pretend like that for someone else, Tanie. It's visible on your face that you just switched on the laptop. Who's pretending? I am working and I have a very bad hangover. Oh come on, Tanie. Accept that something happened last night. And let's talk about it. I can explain what happened last night in great detail. This is a limit. Okay. No problem. I first said that you have beautiful eyes. And then, then I said your neck... Shut up. So shall we talk? What else can you do other than talk? I haven't even spoken so much with my family members. I was sloshed last night. Okay so before we designate it as a mistake, can we please acknowledge that it was damn hot? Zayed? You don't need to be prude, Tanie. I have read your book. The whole book. You are not a nun. Accept that it was damn hot and then maybe we can move on, yeah. Whatever. I don't remember anything. Fine, I'll take it as a yes. And now... Can we talk about something else? I think I have a better idea. Like, we will never be in a relationship. But, we can always be Justin Timberlake and Mina Kunis. Huh? For a romance writer, you have really poor knowledge of pop culture. Friends with benefits. What say? First of all, f#$k off. And second of all, f#$k off. Zayed, we are friends, let's stay as friends. Okay, fine. But I had to make an attempt at least. So I did it. Fair enough. Can I go now? I have work to do. Alright, bye. Bye. Someone's in love, again. Until now I thought it was just lust. But now, things are serious. Kitchen's that way. Dirty dishes are waiting for you. Go clean them. Hi Zayed, how are you? What is it? Why are you video calling me? Why? I am getting married. Wow, man. Congratulations. If you are expecting me to share this news with Sana Di then you are wrong. Nor am I so f#$ked up that I'd dance at your wedding. Hey, is that way to talk to your to-be brother-in-law? Sana Di? What are you two doing together? Wait, what did you just say? We are getting married, again. No, you are not. Di! Di, have you lost your mind? Who the f#$k does the same mistake twice? Hey Zayed listen, you cannot talk like that with my to-be wife. First of all, she is my sister. Di, can you please not sit so close to him? I... I am going to tell dad. He is the one who cleared our doubts. We have his blessings. This lockdown has made everyone lose their minds. You have gone crazy. I am going to call mom. Calm down Zayed and listen to me. It's going to be an online wedding. And I am also inviting Tanie. I really want both of you to be there. Listen, I'll inform the police if you two get married. I'll tell them that you two are Covid positive and aren't telling anyone and are getting married. Huh? And you scoundrel, take your hands off my sister. Take your hands off her. Sweetheart, isn't he going to be my brother-in-law? Enough of this bullshit. Listen, I am not coming to this bullshit wedding of yours. Okay? Zayed, she invited me so nicely. And if she's doing this, I will join and so should you. They are getting married and that's their decision. You should respect it. Stop being so angry. Tanie, you don't get it. You have no idea what had happened. Zayed, but... Tanie, you were right. I don't think I will ever be able find Sangeeta. I think my love story will always remain incomplete. And just to inform you, I have also deleted my online channel. I think I'm heading for a much needed social media detox. Bittu... I am so sorry. Listen, I don't want to come. So don't force me to come, alright? I am not going to beg you to come to the wedding. It's up to you. But it's my responsibility to tell you that if you don't show up then you'll be missing a start of your sister's forever. Go to hell, man. Don't give me that bullshit. I have heard you say this nonsense before as well. It wasn't wrong back then and it isn't wrong now either. People grow up, Zayed. People change. After Sana and I got separated, we stayed away from each other and we found ourselves. And now, our new selves are in love. We found a new way to love each other again, Zayed. Both Sana and I knew that we can never fall in love with anyone else. Your first love remains your first love no matter how much you fight. And who can know that better than you? What the f#$k is that supposed to mean? Listen, enough of this bullshit now, alright? Yes, it is enough, Zayed. I saw you two on your live stories. What you two share is definitely much more than friendship. Have you ever asked yourself why did you have a commitment phobia after Tanie left? Because you always loved her. Everyone is not lucky like you to reunite with your first love, Zayed. If I have learnt something in the past few days then it is that, we don't know what future in stores for us. So if you love someone, tell them. Before it's too late, go and tell Tanie that you love her. Don't let her go. Listen, stop being so dramatic now, okay? - Okay, bye. - Zayed, listen. Zayed... I think you made it too dramatic. That's what I think.
