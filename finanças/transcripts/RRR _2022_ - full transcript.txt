THE STORY Swinging off branches, playing in valleys I should be coddled in mother's lap everyday "The nightingale that sings from behind the tree" "Should be with me as it reciprocates with a 'koo' whenever I call her "Each day as it dawns mother, I should walk in your footsteps "Swinging off branches, playing in valleys "I should be coddled in mother's lap everyday" A good day of hunting, my dear? Yes, it was rather. Do you believe it? It's amazing. Who's the artist? What? This chit of a girl? I want to have this little package on our mantelpiece. Edward. -Yes, sir. The Lady is giving you a token of appreciation for your childs song. Take it, Loki. At your service, Lady. At your service, Lord. Malli. Loki, the money they have given you was not for the song. Theyve bought your daughter. MALLI! Malli. Malli... Malli... My child. Please give me back my child. I fall at your feet. I beg you! I beg you. I fall at your feet. Sergeant! Do you comprehend the value of the bullet in your barrel? It was manufactured in an English factory using English metals. It crossed the 7 seas in an English vessel. By the time it reached the barrel of your gun it cost One Pound. One Pound Sterling! And you would want to squander it on brown rubbish? Clear the road. Please dont take my child away Im begging you Lady, please. THE FIRE OUTSKIRTS OF DELHI Release our leader Lala Lajpat Rai! Otherwise well burn down this police station! Release our leader Lala Lajpat Rai! Of course not, sir. We havent done anything to provoke them. They are rioting here because Lala Lajpat Rai has been arrested in Calcutta. Theyre rabid! We need reinforcements NOW! It's going to take another 7 hours. Hold the line, damn it! Lets burn them down! Arrest that bastard and bring him to me You double-crosser! You filthy traitor! Good God! That mob! I was scared out of my wits, sir! He scares me more. BRITISH BARRACKS, DELHI On the occasion of the annual special officers' ceremony only 3 have been deemed worthy out of 75 candidates for their exceptional contribution. They are Philip Anderson, Charles Langford, Frank Poole. As for the rest of you, better luck next year. Disperse! THE WATER Greetings, sir. He is Mr Venkat Avadhani. Special advisor to the Nizam. Governor Scott is not in India. State the purpose of your visit to Mr Edward. When Governor Scott visited Adilabad recently he brought back with him a little girl. Our Nawab has sent me to tell you something about it. It's regarding the girl we brought from the Deccan. It is our police department's opinion that the girl be returned to her village. It is our Nawab's opinion too- Why so? It is a Gond child that you've brought, sir. -So? -So what? Do they have two horns on their head? They are an innocent people, sir. Even if you oppress them they won't raise their voice. But they have a trait. They like staying in herds like sheep. Even if one lamb goes missing it causes them great distress. This is why the herd has a shepherd. He protects the herd with his life. So this tribal is going to shoot down the mighty British empire with his bow and arrows. So is this tribal going to take us down? Don't misunderstand me. I'm only trying to tell you about him. The shepherd will travel however far to retrieve the missing lamb. Be it morning or night, sun or rain, rocks, mountains, valleys, peaks... he will search anywhere and everywhere for the missing lamb and will eventually find it. If at that time the lamb is in the tiger's mouth he will break its teeth, pry its jaws open and take the lamb back to its herd. It seems that the shepherd has come to Delhi to begin his hunt. FOREST OUTSIDE DELHI The trap is set. Alert our brother. Jangu, it's not a wolf. It's a tiger. Jangu! I am using you for my need. Forgive me, brother. Its been 6 months since weve come to Delhi. We are doing everything we can to find Malli. Do you think... Malli is alive? Akthar. Where did you disappear off to? Theres a lot of work. Come on. Give it to me. Hey! You! Greetings, sir. The engine died on me again what did you repair? Ive been kicking and kicking and this damn thing wont start. Let me check, sir. It's on reserve, sir. Im sorry. Whats the bloody trick? I didn't do anything, sir. You removed something earlier and attached it now so that you can charge me again? I didnt do anything, sir. You cheating bastard! There's no fault of mine, sir. Sir. Please forgive him, sir. -I didnt do anything, sir. -Forgive him, sir. Robert, please stop it. It's not his fault. This will never happen again, sir! I beg you. Oh God! Son. Careful, son. -Brother, are you okay? He is a monster. Look how badly he has beaten him. Why are you hiding your anger, son? If they come to know the truth about me... they will punish you all for giving me shelter. Even though I wasnt born to you, you are protecting me with your life. I shouldn't cause you any harm. Come what may, I'll never let anyone know my true identity. And that is the gist of it. We have a hunter targeting the Governor roaming free in Delhi. We shouldnt really be bothering about imbecile tribals. However our good friend the Nizam who knows the prowess of these tribals seems to think so. And since this is a matter regarding the Governor we should act on it. And with a good deal of bother. -Alright, sir. We will apprehend this bugger. Though I would rather roast this swine on a bed of coals. Let us have the file, sir. Well yes that is the catch, officer. We have nothing on him. You mean nothing? Identifying features? Criminal history? It's quite an impossible task. How the hell are we supposed to catch him? Do they expect us to capture a tribal with no criminal history? The one that accomplishes the impossible will be promoted to the rank of special officer. Do you want him dead or alive? I can vouch for this man. If anyone can do the job, its him. You bring him dead, you receive a bounty. You bring him alive, you will be promoted to special officer. We don't need to search all over Delhi. What he wants is in the Scott's bungalow. He will come there. He will be in those surroundings. How will we find him among so many people? He will think that his enemy's enemies are his friends. We should also act like we are against the British. Before we do that find out where all the revolutionaries and rebels have their meetings. Bow your heads before you go inside and stay that way until you come out. Do your job and leave. Show me your IDs. You. ID. I forgot, sir. Stop, stop it. Stop. -Forgive me, sir. -Why are you hitting him like that? -He's forgotten his ID, ma'am. That doesn't give you the right to treat him like an animal. Sorry ma'am. She seems kind-hearted. We might find a way in if we befriend that girl. Freedom is our birthright. We don't have to beg for our rights. Let's start teaching our children about the idea of revolution. Let's start teaching our children about revolution. One moment. Why beat around the bush? We should hit them where it hurts. Let's kill Governor Scott. Why not just kill King George? He is saying that we should kill Scott. I said that it would be better to kill King George. Brother is it true? Is it possible to kill Scott? Why can't we kill him? What's your name, brother? My name is Lacchu. Scott has done a grave injustice to us, brother. We have come with our brother. Can you please help us? Sure, I will. Where's your brother? I will take you there, brother. Come on. We have been roaming around for so many days, brother. We didn't know whom to ask for help. You appeared like a God- I am an officer on duty. Do a casual check and let us pass through. ID. Hes an officer. -Yes, sir. Is this what youve bought? Its not fresh at all. I will get you a nice fish. Give me one anna. -Hey, Chotu. Come here. Ill be right back. Brother! Brother! What happened? A policeman. He chased me like a cheetah. A police officer? -Jangu Come here. Tell me. He looked like one of us. So I spoke to him. When I got to know that he is a police officer, I escaped from him. If word gets out well all be killed. Dont let anyone see you. Don't come out until I tell you. Go. Raju, once you step on a snake's shadow, you never find it again. We won't find him. The promise we have made to the village will not be fulfilled. We won't find Malli. Save me! Save me! Does anybody have anything? A boat or a rope? Let's save the child. -Are you mad? -No, please don't say that. He's a child. Let's help him. Save me! Save me! -Raju -Akhtar.

She is very beautiful. Why dont you speak to her? I would like to. But I can't find a way. Brother, to speak to a girl you shouldn't try to find a way. You should pave your own path. You drive the bike. Ill show you the way. Akhtar, stop here. Stop here? But why? Because the car will stop here. Shell stop here? Oh no. How did you know that the car would stop here? I threw some nails on the road. The tyres have gotten punctured. Wow! Youre so clever. Now I will repair her tyres. She will thank me. That way, we can speak to each other. Is that it? Excuse me! Could you help? My tyres have gone flat. Yes, maam! Our shop is very close by I will patch up your tyres in 5 minutes He means it will take at least 5 hours. Oh! Is there a bus stop or a tram station nearby? She is asking if theres a bus stop or a tram station nearby. Yes. Very close- -Shake your head Perhaps you can ask him for a ride. Oh. Are you going that way? She is asking if youre going that way. Will you give her a lift? -No. -Nod your head. Oh. Thats a yes? -Yes. -Wonderful, let me get my things.

How's your girlfriend? What? I mean your lover, girlfriend sweetheart, darling. Dont say that. Its wrong. Wrong? If she didnt like you would she hop on your bike? I don't know. Tell me what to do next. Okay. What's her name? It's a very big name but Ive memorised it. 'Don't call me memsaab, it is Jenny yes' Don't call me memsaab, it is Jenny yes. Thats not her name. It means that 'don't call me madam, just Jenny will do' Oh, Jenny. It's a small name only. Okay. What else did you talk about? We spoke a lot. But while she was leaving she said 'party... come' or something like that. She invited you to a party? That too on the first meeting? Where, when? -Here, she gave me this.

Look at them. -Wait. Look at all these brown buggers. What do they know about art? About finesse. About dance. Tango. Swing. Flamenco. Can you do any of these? Huh? Not salsa. Not Flamenco, my brother. Do you know 'Naatu'? What is Naatu? Like an aggressive bull jumping in the dust of the fields Like the lead dancer dancing at a local goddesss festival Like playing with the stick while wearing wooden slippers Like a gang of young boys assembling under the shade of a banyan tree Like eating a jowar roti with a chilli Listen to my song. Listen to my song Listen to my song Naatu Naatu Naatu Crazy Naatu Naatu Naatu Naatu Wild Naatu Naatu like a green chilli Naatu like a sharp dagger Ive had enough of this nonsense! You two! Out! No Jake. Ive had enough of your bullying. Go away! Go! Like beating a drum which makes your heart beat faster Like the shrill voice of a bird which can make your ears ring Like singing a song which can make your fingers snap in rhythm Like the wild dance when there is a fast rhythm Like dancing which makes your body sweat Listen to my song Listen to my song Listen to my song Naatu Naatu Naatu Crazy Naatu Naatu Naatu Naatu Wild Naatu Naatu like a green chilli Naatu like a sharp dagger This is disgusting! This is filthy! Jenny!

Ram! Ram! -No. Come on, Akhtar. Come on, Akhtar. Yes! Oh God! Get down now. You are so heavy. How much further should I carry you? -Don't say that brother! I beg you. If I take another step my legs will fall off. Please carry me a little longer. Why did you dance so much if you were in so much pain? I don't know. When you looked at me like that I just felt like competing with you. Are you hurt? Whats happened? Is he alright? Hes got a bad cramp. Can you drop him at New Bazaar? Of course. Get in. Would you like to come to my place for a coffee? Before I drop you home. She is inviting you to her house for a cup of coffee. I would offer to drop you too, but its only a two seater. No problem, I am waiting for a friend. Alright, bye. The first time we met him, he rested his hand on my shoulder. I remember clearly. I noticed paint in his nails. He is definitely a painter. Search that way, uncle. Listen, did you see him? -No. Have you seen him anywhere? -No. Good morning, Thomas. How are you today? I'm very good. Thank you so much. How about you? I'm good, thank you. Open the gates. The second gate only opens once the first is closed. I dont understand the need for such elaborate security measures. Overwhelming, huh? Uncle Scott is coming back from London in two days. he has been knighted by the King. Aunt Cathy wants to throw a grand party on his arrival. Everything is checked, sir. Have you checked every door? Hundreds of people are working round the clock to make sure everything is smooth- -I don't want any hangups, officer. -Yes, sir. See these lights? They were commissioned- -What the hell are you doing here? Robert, what are you doing? He is with me. He is here by my invitation. Let him go. Servants cant use the main entrance, ma'am. Ill show him the back entrance. Robert! Robert! He is not a servant. He is my friend. Let him go. As you wish, ma'am. That was appalling behavior. I apologize. I'm so sorry. It's okay. You're fine, right? Okay let's forget about him. I was really looking forward to this. I have so much that I wanted to show you. Please. Come, sit down. This is my room and these are my paintings. What do you think? Please. Sit down. Your dance at the party took my breath away. It was amazing. Thank you, madam. Jenny. Thank you, Jenny. It was overwhelming. The beat pulsating through your body the flying feet, the flashing eyes... the eyes. Akhtar your deep expressive eyes always seem like they are searching for something. Jenny, I can't understand what you are saying. "O Mynah, I won't paint your wings, come to me" "O crescent moon, I won't decorate you with peacock feathers, come to me" I'm hungry Oh... Im so sorry... I will get you something to eat. "We should play along as we eat heartily" "O wandering rabbit, come to me" "Swinging off branches, playing in valleys "I should be coddled in mother's lap everyday" Maggie. -Yes, ma'am.. Malli... Brother! Brother. Brother. Don't cry, Malli. I'm here, right? I dont want to stay here anymore. Take me with you. Don't shout. If the police hear us it won't be good for us. Listen, Ill come back to take you from here. Brother. So you are not taking me with you now? There is no other way, Malli. No! I want to go home. Take me away now! I won't be here for another moment. Wont you listen to me? Listen to me, Malli- -I won't listen to you. -Don't make noise. If somebody hears us, we will get caught. I don't know all that. Brother. Brother. Please don't leave me here. I want to go back to my mother. Please take me home. "Swinging off branches, playing in valleys "All of it will be in front of your eyes if you close them" "The nightingale singing behind the tree will appear in your heart whenever you close your eyes" "The trees and tender leaves will see today from the stone enclosure around them If you are patient enough to close your eyes for a moment The day will soon come when you will be free Mother Don't these white women bear children? Don't they know what pain is? They took away a child and locked her in a cage. Even if they cry once they will understand how painful tears are. What shall we do now? We need to get Malli back. We shouldn't be scared anymore. We should surge forward. Whoever comes in our way should be eliminated. Jangu, where is Lacchu? Where is your brother? Where is your brother? My brother is on a mission, and he is not going to be captured. Especially not by traitors like you. A dog can never hunt down a tiger. Nobody is coming, sister. Seetha... Did you receive any message from Ram? -No, uncle. -Has he at least written a letter? What is this? It has been 4 years since he left. How much longer should we wait for him? Does he even remember us? Does he remember his village, his land, the promise he has made us? Forget about us. Does he at least remember you? You will keep experiencing this pain until I get an answer. Tell me... where is your brother? Banded Krait snake. Even the English don't have a cure for its venom. You are going to die within an hour. It will take you a day to untie these knots. Live your life. The family is organizing an event to celebrate Scott's return. We should execute our plan tonight at any cost. If we miss this oppurtunity, we might not get another one. The truck is working properly, right? I've tested it again. It's in good condition. We should storm in as soon as the arrangements are done. Jangu, you remember everything, right? I've memorized everything, brother. Lets go. Brother, when are you going to reach the bungalow? I'll come at 8o clock. Peddayya, ask Abbajaan to inspect the vehicle again. Jangu, go right now and memorize the sound of the gates. What happened? Brother. Brother, what happened? Brother. Banded Krait snake. Peddayya, I need a burning piece of coal. Jangu, get a datura root. Brother. Brother. Youll be fine. East and west are engaged in a tug of war Ones a deadly weapon The others a bringer of death Once the veil is lifted, wont there be a destructive war? Looks like the poison has taken effect. Why are you removing the holy thread? Dont do it, brother. Removing it will bring you problems. Brother needs it more than me. You guys leave. Dont close your eyes, brother. Im here with you. Youll be fine. Im here with you. Youre out of danger now. The antidote is working against the poison. You will have recovered completely by tomorrow. I have some work. I'll be back. Brother. If I had a choice I would stay with you. But I have to go. Brother Ive hidden a truth from you. I'm not Akhtar. I'm not a muslim. Im Bheem. Son of the Gonds. They took away a little girl from our village. We didn't know what to do. We didn't know how to save her. We didn't know whom to trust. That is why I put on this disguise. I wanted to seek your help on many occasions. But I didn't do so because I didnt want to put your life in danger. Not because I dont trust you. We are going tonight to rescue Malli. If we get out safely I will come meet you again. If I don't make it... I have your friendship which is more precious than my life. I'll die with pride. Until next time, brother. I have your friendship which is more precious than my life. Brother needs it more than me. What a grand party Aunt Catherine has put on. Come, lets join her. -Lets stay with our friends. Lady Buxton... Pleasure as always. -Thank you. And what a magnificent event you have organized, ma'am. Brother. Malli. Malli. Malli. Brother! Akhtar. Brother... why are you wearing this uniform? Im arresting you for the crimes youve committed against the British Government. Brother, are you a police officer? Are you really a police officer? I can't believe it. Surrender, Akhtar. I swear on my mother. I didn't do anything wrong. I told you about my problems, right? Brother, brother, I really didn't do anything wrong. Just look into my eyes once, brother. Brother I havent done anything wrong! We came here for our sister. She is a small child. She is a small child. Im begging you. Let us take our sister home. Let us take our sister home! I'm not going to ask you again, Akhtar. Surrender. Surrender! Why are you talking like this? Surrender! I'm not able to bear seeing you like this, brother Brother, arent you one of us? Youre one of us, right? If we don't arrest him by then the governor will skin us alive. -Brother! -Shut up, you insolent brat! -Brother. -Malli. Brother. Surrender, Bheem. Surrender if you want Malli to stay alive. Brother! "This is an unforeseen turn of fate" "Which has culminated in this friendship" "Its yet to be seen if this will end in bloodshed" We dont know anything, sir. Theyve escaped, sir. It's as though they have vanished, sir. Nobody knows anything about their whereabouts. We've got the big fish, sergeant. Just a matter of time before we flush the rats out of their holes. Let's go. -Yes sir. Move out! Owing to his outstanding performance in the field, and for capturing a dangerous criminal, Mr A Rama Raju is being awarded the rank of special officer. First line point. Second line point. Attack. Move. Change. Change. Turn and point. Turn and point. Load. Relax. Point your weapons. Second line point. First line point. Final position. Second line, point your weapons, move. Third line, point your weapons, move. Crawl faster. Mani. -Baba. This drill should be done in 15 seconds. -Okay, sir. Load. Load. Baba, these wooden rifles are only for practice, right? We have learned how to wield the weapon. Our blood is boiling to shoot a real bullet. When will you give us real rifles? Do you know the value of this bullet? It costs 15 rupees. But an Englishman once explained what its real value is. To the people of the village of Paalakurthi, these are the government's orders. Since a very long time the villagers haven't been paying any taxes citing floods as a reason. When a British officer came here to investigate this your village head Singavarapu Malla Reddy manhandled him. This is a heinous crime. For the crime of sedition, the criminal has been sentenced to death. Soldier. Do you understand how valuable the bullet in your gun is? It was manufactured by an Englishman. At full pay. It made its way here on an English ship. By the time that single bullet has made its way to the barrel of your gun it has cost the crown 6 shillings. You dont waste it on peasant stock. Find another way, soldier. Yes, sir. He said that an Indians life is not worth a bullet. So how will this bullet earn its value? When it comes out of your gun and pierces an Englishmans heart. When that flaming bullet will bathe in his blood. Then... Only then this bullet will earn its value. The name of that value is Freedom. When I'm sure that you won't miss even one shot. I will give you the bullets Keep practicing until then. Hey! How many times did I tell you not to eat with your left hand? It will get done faster this way, mother. Ram. -Uncle. -Come, Venkateswarulu. -Brother take this... Seetha, why are you always here? Don't you ever go home? Wherever there is Ram, I'll be there. I don't know if she will become my daughter-in-law but she is my daughter already. You're building an army here. But you've sent me into the police force. I want to be here with you, Baba. No. It is necessary that you be there. We need their inside information. Okay. What do we do now? We will need weapons once the training is done. All you have is one rifle and a few bullets. How many people will you give them to? Every bullet has the name of the person it is going to kill. Every rifle has on it the name of the person who is going to shoot it. They will come, Venkateswarlu. The weapons will come themselves in search of their battle. Turn and point. Load. Rest the rifle properly on your shoulder. What happened? Down. What is this? Last night... I fired your rifle, Baba. Do you think it is a toy? Is it a toy? I gave it to him, Baba. Seetha! I gave it to him. But Ram fired really well. Let me show you. Come. There. Rama. Did you shoot from those boulders? No, Baba. Then? From there, Baba. Baba, it was a mistake... I wont do it again. The weapon is ready, Venkateswarlu. Our son? Take cover. Venkata Rama Raju... Surrender. Otherwise, we will shoot down everyone. We wont spare anyone- Let's fight, Baba. Let's fight! This isn't the time to fight, Ranga. We need to save the villagers first. Take everyone to the small bridge. -Okay, Baba. We scared him, sir. Venkata Rama Raju. -Go. Surr- Faster! That way. Go. Fast. Go. Move. I'll stop them from there. On my signal lead everyone into the forest. Lay low in Maavullamma valley. These Englishmen cant reach there. Careful. Dear. What about you? Sarojini. I am my battle. And half of that is yours. Rama! Rama! Stop. Down! I told you to be with your mother. Why did you come here? He has got good cover, sir. He is not letting us advance. Baba. Down Hide. Baba. Aunt. Aunt. Rama Will you increase the value of the bullet? Your aim should be precise. Take it. Load. Aim. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Down. Move. Move. Fast. Chinna! Mother! Load. Load. Baba, mother. Brother, Baba! Load! Aim. Shoot. Shoot. We have to change the strategy. Back. Fall back! Baba. Baba. Baba. Baba. Did you see that? Just one rifle and how all of them have fallen back? Just imagine... ...If every person had a weapon ...then they would go back to their country for good. Give me your word, Ram. Promise me that you will give every person a weapon. Dear Seetha, how are you? Everything is going according to the plan. Guns are sent to different parts of the country from the barracks that I'm working in. And each time there's a consignment, they choose an officer to transport it safely. I'm going to get that opportunity very soon. The weapons are within reach. But why is my heart heavy, Seetha? I'm hurting the people whose freedom I'm fighting for. I have betrayed my closest friend. I am nearing my goal But am I losing my way? I am unable to understand. I wish you were with me. One bastard did this and all of you could do nothing. Shame on you! I appreciate you, young man. Your service to the crown has been duly noted. Thank you, sir. I want this bastard punished in such a way that no person will ever rise up against the British. Oh I want to watch it, darling. I want to see him bleed. And so you shall. Flog him publicly! Flog him till he falls to his knees confessing his crime of daring to rise against us. And begs for mercy. Sir. The criminal who tried to break into Governor Scott's palace will be publicly flogged tomorrow. It is the Governor's orders that everybody be present. This criminal is now going to fall to his knees and confess to his crimes and he is going to plead the Governor for mercy. If he fails to do so, he will be punished severely. Kneel down. Kneel down, Bheem! There's hardly any blood. Hit him harder. A few lashes and the bugger's buckled. But he barely even cried out loud. And where's the blood? I was expecting a pool at his feet. He didn't kneel. He didn't kneel! Officer! Try this one. Use it on the pillar first, officer. Let the wretch see how it will rip him. Aren't you quite vicious, my dear? This isn't going to stop, Bheem. If you don't kneel down you will be killed. Kneel and confess to your crimes. Save your own life. Bheema, the earth which has given birth to you, the trees which give you air to breathe, your gond tribe which has given you a name are talking to you. Can you hear it? "O komuram bheem, O komuram bheem" "You should stoke the fire in your heart "O komuram bheem, O komuram bheem" "You should burn like the flaming sun" Make that bastard kneel now! "Should you fall at your oppressor's feet like a slave..." you are no more a child of the forest" "If you bow your head to unjust rule you could not have been born to the forest. "O komuram bheem, O komuram bheem" "You should stoke the fire in your heart Will you scream in pain when the whip splits your skin?" Will you tremble with fear at the mere sight of blood?" "If you get scared and shed a tear how can you say that youve had Mother Earth's breastmilk? "O komuram bheem, O komuram bheem" "You should stoke the fire in your heart "Your heart's blood which flows like a stream "Your heart's blood which flows like a stream look - it is like vermilion on Mother earth's forehead" "It is like sacred red paint on Mother's feet" "It shines like the smile on Mother's lips" "O komuram bheem, O komuram bheem" "You have given your life as a gift to Mother Earth" "O komuram bheem Reinforcements! Raju, youve been appointed as the incharge for the guns consignments delivery. Look. The consignment will be shipped in 2 days. Promise me that you will give every person a weapon. Bheem is going to be hanged the day after tomorrow. I should get the place changed from the jail. To the bank of Yamuna river. What are you saying? Why... why would you want to shift the hanging location? Only from there I will be able to free Bheem. Raju. What is this business of freeing Bheem? I should also free Malli and hand her over to Bheem Bheem? Malli? Are you in your senses? It has never been more clear to me, uncle. All this while I was prepared to sacrifice anything to achieve freedom for our country. I thought Bheem would also be one among them. But today Ive realized... Bheem is not merely a sacrificial lamb. He is a volcano. I was under the impression that guns would bring us freedom. But Bheem inspired everyone with just a song. What about you? You've striven so much to achieve your goal. Will you forego all of that when it is within your reach? Will you sacrifice 15 years of hardwork- -I will bear it for another 25 years. But I won't sacrifice Bheem for my goal. Baba told me to give a weapon to every person. But Bheem's emotion has turned each person into a weapon. I will give that emotion to the people. Think about it, Raju. It is very dangerous you could lose your life. I will die gladly, uncle. I want the best hangman for the job. I want to see his neck drawn out tight and his eyes bulge and pop just before his neck snaps. Yes, sir. But I doubt you will see fear in his eyes. I mean the fear which didn't appear while he was being whipped violently will not appear even in the face of death. -Yes. And what was blatantly obvious was your abject failure at bringing this brute to his knees. I'm sorry to have disappointed you, sir. Give me one more opportunity. Let us hang him in front of Malli for whom he has come this far.. All of the world's fear will then be seen in his eyes. I see you have learnt the ways of the empire, young man. Keep the flag flying. -Yes sir. Have him ready for hanging by 4AM and get that wretched child here by 5. -If I may, sir. -Yes. If you hang him here the people will make him a martyr. Temples will be built on his grave. We must take him away. To the banks of the river Yamuna. If we hang him there we can dispose of his corpse discreetly. Take care. Load them carefully. Be alert, officers. I want no hiccups on this mission. Yes, sir. What are you doing? -Help. -Go there! Get back! Back. All arrangements have been made, sir. Should be quite the spectacle. I appreciate your effort, my boy. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. You had arrested my brother, right? Where is he now? Tell me, brother. Go faster! I said faster, damn it! Bring me those treacherous scum alive. Or I will skin every last one of you. Brother. Brother!! Malli! I'll be back Without you... I... Seetha A part of me will always be with you. Seetha, my courage drives me. But it is your courage which will make me win. Grandfather.. uncle... brother... I'm giving my word to the entire village. I will give weapons to every hand which is itching to revolt. Only after that will I come back! I swear on mother Godavari! -Vande mataram! -Vande mataram! -Vande mataram! -Vande mataram! Its been months, Edward. This jungle rat Bheem is still proving elusive. We are very close, sir. From the hanging point his only means of escape is to Agra. And we are sealing it off. We are combing it area by area... ...inch by inch... Shutting it down. The only place he can be possibly hiding now is Hathras. Keep at it. Meanwhile lets pay our special guest a visit. Shall we? As you ordered, we are feeding him only once a week, sir. Just enough to keep him alive and feel the pain. Like these filth? -Oh no, sir. Much worse than them. Hed be so starved, hed be gnawing at his chains. Exercising? With only days to live? What do you hope to achieve? Still chasing your impossible dream even with death staring you in the face? [SANSKRIT VERSES] You have every right to work but not to expect the result. [SANSKRIT VERSES] Let not the result be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction. I dont care about the result. I will be moving towards my goal until my last breath. Load. Aim. Shoot. Is that so? Lets see how you move after this. Throw him in the solitary cell. It's been 2 days since we came here. It's not good to stay in one place for so long. We need to leave after midnight. Where will we go? There is no place to hide. Don't worry, Peddayya. We will find a way. Im hungry, brother. Oh God. The only thing we are able to give a hungry child is some water. Jangu. It is getting very difficult. Buying even a grain of rice is seeming impossible. [ANNOUNCEMENT] These dangerous criminals have escaped their execution, and are at large. Report to the nearest police station if you find anyone acting suspicious. Wake up! -That way. -Go, go.. They are here. Inspector, I want you to search that room. There are many policemen outside. Yes, sir. I want the names and addresses of everybody. Check in that room also. Sir, please help us. Please help me take them to the hospital. My people have been infected with smallpox. What? -Smallpox, sir... smallpox. Smallpox. Whats in the bag? They have smallpox, sir. Smallpox!? Are you sure? -Masoochi is smallpox, sir. This place is infected! Everyone out! I beg you, sir. Please help us. -Get away from me, you diseased rat. Everyone out! Out! It's okay. I'm fine. You said smallpox. Who has it? Nobody. I just said that to help you from the police. My fiancee always says that we should help other people. Please come. I overheard you earlier... Children shouldn't know hunger.. Even food feels bad. We are indebted to you. You have helped us without knowing who we are. Who are you? My name is Seetha. I'm from near Visakhapatnam. I have come here for my fiancee. Oh, really? Where does your fiancee live? Delhi. He is working as a police inspector for the British. -What is her name? -Seetha. Oh. Please don't be worried. What my fiancee is doing is not just a job. Its a revolution. Rama to attain your goal you should be ready to face any kind of obstacle. Whatever happens dont forget your goal. Surround them from all sides. Bastard! You thought you could take on us? See the dog bleed. Load. Aim. Shoot! Let the blue sky be painted with fiery red embers Let my battlecries be the war sounds that will annihilate the enemy. But then did he get the weapons? He was very close to getting them.. but in the process he had to betray his closest friend and arrest him for the British. He couldnt live with himself. He was unable to understand whether what he was doing was right or wrong. He finally decided to save his friend, come what may. And he did save him. But he got caught while doing it. Ive received this letter from the government. He is going to be hanged in two days. Theyve asked me to come collect his body- I came for Malli. But your fiancee came for the land. The tribal that I am I couldn't understand. I beat him with these hands. I left my closest friend to die. Seetha shouldn't go looking for Ram. Ram should come to wherever Seetha is. I will bring him to you. You've fed us. I'm giving you my word now. I'll bring back your Ram even if I have to lay down my life. This is the whole barracks. The jail is at the end of the barracks. Be careful. Bheem. Bheem. -Brother. -Bheem. Bheem, why did you come here? Forgive me, brother. I didnt realise that you were working towards such a great cause. -I shouldnt have- -Calm down. Bheem. Bheem. Bheem. Who told you? Seetha... Did you meet Seetha? She opened my eyes to the truth. I promised Seetha that I would bring back her Ram. Even if I have to burn down this Lanka, I will take you to her. Come, brother. "Between a tiger and a hunter" "Between a head and the guillotine" "Between a wildfire" "and a storm" "Between the sun and the cloud" Friendship" Surround them from all sides. Spread out. Surround. Surround. "This is an unforeseen turn of fate" "Which has culminated in this friendship" Where did they go? What the hell is going on here? "Friendship between an erupting volcano and a wild storm" "Friendship between freewill and destiny" "This friendship is between opposites" -Whats going on, Edward? -We arrived a bit late, sir. They escaped into the forest. -Theyve done what? But they are still in the barracks. Dont follow them blindly. Take the specials forces and nail the bastards. One more thing. Dont shoot until youre close enough to confirm a kill. Absolutely, sir. Call the special forces. Fire! Sir, Edward here. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! What the hell is going on out there? We thought we had them surrounded, sir. But now there are arrows coming out of everywhere. Were losing men, sir. Damn them all! Im sending additional troops. Do not let them escape! Yes, sir. More troops are on the way. We are getting reinforcements. Don't let them escape. Don't let them escape. More troops are on the way. Edward! I promised my father that I will give everyone a weapon. Turn on the searchlights. I've made a promise to mother Godavari that I will come back only after I get the weapons. Turn on those lights.
