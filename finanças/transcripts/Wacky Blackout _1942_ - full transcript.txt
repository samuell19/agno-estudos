"WACKY BLACKOUT" Howdy, folks. You know, I reckon a lot of you people out there are sort of wondering about us here on the farm during this war. Well, I want you to know that we're prepared for any emergency. Yeah, sure. Just like the city folks. Now, take this farmer here. Why, he's heard and read about them there incendiary bombs. You know what he's done? He's even trained his pet dog to help put out the fires. Here's his dog just about to go into action. He's a full-blooded spitz. Now, take this here cow for instance. Why, you know she's increased her production and she's now giving 5000 quarts of milk a day. That seems like a lot of milk, but 5000 quarts is what she gives. Gives, nothing. They come in and take it from me. [crying] What a performance. Well, look who's here. It's Old Tom. You know, Old Tom is about the oldest cat in these here parts. Yes, sir. Why, he's been around for the last three wars and he knows that this one will turn out all right too. [pecking nearby] Uh, say, now, would you look at that. A teeny little woodpecker. Now, I bet you I know what he's aiming to be when he grows up. I reckon he plans to be a riveter at Lockheed. Ooh! Look at that cat's tail. Ooh! If I do, I'll get a whipping. I'll do it. [cat screeches] You know, we American people always sort of look forward to Thanksgiving. And this year is certainly no exception. This here turkey is getting fattened up. Yes, sir, he's getting lots to eat and you know what? When he reaches 20 pounds, he'll be ready for the oven. Twenty pounds? Oven? [spitting] You know, uh, these turtle eggs they've been laying around in the sun for quite a spell and uh, well what do you know, looks like they're getting ready to hatch. [pecking then cat screeches] I did it again. [laughs] Well, as I was saying, these little turtles are born with a natural bombproof shelter n on their backs. Ain't that cute? Hey, what in the world has come over that? Hey, little fella. What do you think you are? [beeps] I'm a jeep. Jeep, jeep. [laughs] Well, now that we're back on the farm [chuckles] let's sort of peek in on a young fella who's a-courting his sweetie. Oh, Marie-Alana, um, ahh Would you be my, ahh? Would you like to? Oh, no, no, no. Would you be my, uh? Oh, gosh. I wish there was a blackout. Oh, uh oh! Blackout! Oh, boy. Oh, boy. [laughing] Oh, boy. Blackout! Blackout! I just don't know what has come over the caterpillars. Just seem to lay around and look glum. Well, would you look at that little fella. He sure looks happy, don't he? Happy? Of course, I'm happy. I just got a retread. [laughs] Uh, these little fireflies here, are gonna stage a practice blackout. Looks like they're set to go. Okay, lights out. Hey there, turtle. You better pull into your shelter. It's a blackout. Nope, I'd, uh, rather not. Pull your head in. That's better. Why in the world didn't you wanna go into your shell? Well, uh, I'm afraid of the dark. All right, fireflies. Blackout's over. Hey, you. You on the end. Yes, you. What happened to your light? Hey, who's the bulb snatcher? Who's the bulb snatcher? Did you ever see a prettier sight than this here mother bird? She is a-teaching her little son how to fly. It's very easy, darling. Just flap your wings like this. See? Come on, now. Do as Mommy did. Ah, Ma. I wanna be a dive-bomber. [mimicking plane engine] [mimics machine guns] I guess about the only living creatures that haven't been affected by the war are the famous swallows of Capistrano. Yes, sir. As you all know, these here birds return to the mission on a certain day each year and we're here just in time to see them come back. They'll be along any minute now. Telegram for the audience. What does it say? It says here: We are out over the ocean Can't even get close to land We can't fly to Capistrano Past the Fourth Interceptor Command Signed, The Swallows. Now, you folks all know how valuable carrier pigeons is in wartime. [pecking then cat screeches] I did it. [bird pecking] As I was saying, about them there carrier pigeons, well now, this proud couple is famous around these parts. During the last war they gave more sons to the service than was ever thought possible. [weakly] Well, Ma ♪ We did it before ♪ ♪ And we can do it again ♪ ♪ And we will do it again ♪ [scatting] That's all, folks!
