Yeah, so, ever since then, it's kind of become one of my pre-race rituals. Oh, my God. Doesn't that hurt you, like, the night before a race? Yeah, but running hurts. You still enjoy that, right?

I say it was a good trade." Mary Lou Retton. We all know the college running star Plum Marigold. But the Olympic Trials? It's a whole new level of competition. What's going through your mind right now? Well, I've wanted to make an Olympic team for my entire life. All the work is done. I just have to stick to my routine and, you know, turn in my homework. So I'm not going to let any distractions get in my way between now and making the Olympic team. One sec. So, I just sold a bunch of power muffins to a group of 80-year-old guys wearing the same tights as you. Cool. - What? - Sorry. Fine. It's okay. What? I sent in my Eugene Marathon design today. The committee loved the idea of finishing at Hayward Field. They said that's something you can't do in New York or Boston. Mm. It's just exciting, is all. Okay. Sweetie, I know you're worried about tomorrow's race. But listen... Do you know what the kernels are? What, Dad? Untapped potential, all right? I have so many 10th-graders, 11th-graders on my team that could be great if they chose, but there's only 24 hours in a day. Okay, Dad. You know what the-- ah-- the burnt ones are? Burnouts.

Who will go all the way? Final stretch. Legere, Siegel, Hirsch, Schmidt, Anderson, and Marigold grabbing the last spot in the finals! The men's 10,000 meters. Plum! Plum Marigold! You just got sixth place to advance to the finals. Must feel pretty good. Yeah, I'm happy to be advancing. You were seeded first in that heat. Can you talk about what happened? It looked like you were in pain towards the end there. No, yeah, with 300 to go, I tried to make a move and got a little knocked around and, um, you know, wasn't feeling that final kick, and, you know, nothing's guaranteed. And, um, I tried to be brave. I'm sorry. "Expectation is the root of all heartache." William Shakespeare. I can't recommend that you run in the finals unless you're recovered. You had an extremely aggressive race today, and your body needs to heal. I want you to take tomorrow completely off. No running. But I never take days completely off. The finals are in three days. I'm well aware, but if you want to tow the line strong, you need to be smart now. Plum, what's your weekly mileage? 90 to 100. It says here you haven't menstruated in two years. Is that right? Is that bad? It has to do with your bone density, which is likely low, and poor bone density can lead to complications-- for starters, increased likelihood of injury, permanent damage. There are long-term consequences that you need to consider beyond your athletics. I mean, you're still a woman. What does that matter? Hello? Hello! They said I'm ruining my body!

Great timing, Mom! Gail, um... are your parents with you? No. Maybe we should call them. No, I don't have to tell them everything I do. What-- Is Plum mad because of me? No. She had a very hard race. I thought the race was Monday. The finals are Monday. The prelims were today. Gail, okay, we love it when you visit, but you have to contact us before you come, Gail. It's as simple as that. You don't think I should go talk to her? No, absolutely not. Absolutely not. ♪ You made the finals. It didn't have to be pretty. This isn't just a fun race.

You can't worry about her. Just take your nap, okay? Hey, do you think we're going to be able to have babies? What? Plum, we're fine. Yeah. Let's worry about not having babies for now, okay? Okay.

Please turn that back on. I don't like it when you fall asleep in front of the TV. It makes me feel sad for you. Plum, I was just watching TV. I don't know why that would make you sad. Because it does. Okay. Can you stay home tomorrow so I'm not all alone? Plummy, the Pancake Mile is tomorrow. I'm captain of that ship. I have to be there all day. You have that every year.

My mom was a nomad. I mean, I grew up moving around a lot. Where is she now? Arizona. She decided to leave Eugene for good and run off with her boyfriend. I guess not everyone was meant to stay. I stayed. And I'm happy. I've only ever lived in Eugene. That's cool. See, I think Eugene is like this sink drain, but not in a bad way. It doesn't suck people down.

Plum... stop. You look amazing. Whoa, whoa. Is this okay? It's just moving really quickly. You've never done this before? Mm. No. Okay. I got a question. Okay. When you're running, is there such a thing as going too fast? Well, when you're running, there's an edge... between... what is and isn't too fast. Okay. But, um, it's not a sharp edge. It's stretchy. And if you're brave, you push on it. I have to go. No. Stay. I can't. My teammate is waiting for me, and I have to go to be with her. Why don't you just tell her you can't come?

Every race has two things in common-- there can only be one winner, and it's always going to hurt." Tracktown's own Plum Marigold! "A race is like a cliff. You have to get close to the edge to see the view. At first, it scares you. It will probably always scare you. But the closer you are to falling, the more beautiful it is."
