[BARACK OBAMA] As commander in chief, I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan. [WATER SPRINKLING] [BARACK OBAMA] We have been at war now for eight years at enormous cost in lives and resources. - [BIRDS CHIRPING] - [CHILDREN TALKING] [BARACK OBAMA] This decision asks even more of you. A military that, along with your families, has already borne the heaviest of all burdens. [GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] - [BOY'S VOICE] Joey, come on! - [WATER SPLASHING] It's already filled. [CHILD PLAYING] - [COMPUTER HUMMING] - [MOUSE CLICKING] These are pictures of my dad's places in Afghanistan. This is the first base that he was at. I think he said that was his tent right there. Um, there's him saluting one of his high-ranking officers. There's his truck right there. [MOUSE CLICKING] [BOY] There, that's my dad, me and Joey. I know, but Uncle Shawn, it moves side to side. I can't really write like that. My name is Joey... and I'm seven-and-a-half years old. My brother is... twelve-and-a-half, I think. - Cheetahs, I can learn about cheetahs. - That's a good one. It's an animal. [JOEY] My dad's in Afghanistan trying to make this country how it is. [GENTLE MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] [JOEY] Uncle Shawn, you know I'm not gonna eat it. [JOEY] He said if he's not doing this right now, then we'll have bullets flying over our heads at night. [BOY] My uncle said he'd take both of us for 14 months. It was kind of hard to move 'cause I had to get all new friends. These guys are gonna come with us and then we'll meet you at the airport. And then... Uh, Isaac's right here, he's working on some stuff. Isaac, it's your dad. He's in Atlanta. Hey, Dad. Good. Yeah. My dad's coming back for two weeks for a vacation. When he walks through the gate, I'm gonna get up and sprint to him. [ISAAC] Joey, there's Dad's plane. There's Dad's plane right there. See it? Yes! [SIGHING] [ISAAC] I'm gonna see if I can see my dad through the window. I know. Look and see if you see him through the window. I'm gonna see if... I'm just gonna wave in case he sees me. Dad's coming off first. All right, come on! Hold it up! Look cheerful. Come on, Mr. Soldier Man. - Is that him? - No, he's not that buff. My dad's... Yeah, my dad's not that buff. - He's here. - Can you hang on to this? Yep, go. - [BRIAN GRUNTING] - [BOYS LAUGHING] [APPLAUSE] [BRIAN] I love you, guys. Hey. [ISAAC CRYING] [SNIFFLING] - [ISAAC CRYING] - [BRIAN LAUGHING] Hey. - [LAUGHING] - [KISSING] [BRIAN] I love you, guys. Are you happy to see me? - Huh? - [CRYING] Yeah. - [ISAAC SOBBING] - [BRIAN] What's that? - I'm happy. - [BRIAN] Good job. - [ALL SIGHING] - [ISAAC SNIFFLING] You look the same, Dad. Well, I hope so. - Oh, wow. Dad? - I've only been gone six months. I feel blocks. Yeah, I've been working out! - I feel blocks. - [JOEY] I feel blocks, too. I feel blocks, too. [ISAAC] Love you. - [BACKGROUND LAUGHTER] - [KISSING] - [ISAAC] I love you, Dad. - I missed you. - I missed you, too. - [BRIAN LAUGHS] I'm glad to be home. And I'm sorry if I smell, okay? It's fine. You smell like a regular military guy. Just like I learned. Just like I like. - Just how I like it. - A regular military guy? Hi, guys. - [WOMAN] Hi. Welcome home. - [MAN] Hey, Uncle Ray! ["RIDIN' SOLO" PLAYING] You guys all right? [ISAAC] Yep. I'm singing my favorite song. [YAWNS] Joe Joe. Joey. [JOEY] Yeah? Isaac, I think your braces look good. [ISAAC] What? I think your braces look good. [ISAAC] Thank you. [ISAAC] I officially have butcher teeth! You ever do anything to wreck those, you're in big trouble. [ISAAC] I won't. [ISAAC] When my dad was at Afghanistan, I felt like I had, like, a 25-pound weight on my shoulders. And then when my dad came back, it was like... [WHOOSHING SOUND] gone. [BRIAN] Hey, did you guys spray yet? [BRIAN] It's a lot easier being a platoon sergeant than it is raising two boys by yourself. When I got divorced, their mother chose other paths and the court said, "You're not gonna have custody of your kids." So I've been doing it, you know, by myself. She hasn't seen them in almost two and a half years. [BRIAN] I had a bite, though, he took half of it. Yeah. See? Look at this. He's not very big. [BRIAN] I question myself every day if I'm doing the right thing for my kids. You know, I'm trying to do my duty to my country and deploy, you know, and do what Uncle Sam asks me to do, but you know, what's everybody asking my boys to do? [ISAAC] The Army is really great and I really like that he's in it, but it's just hard thinking like, "Please, just, like, bring him back safe and..." Just worrying about him. [ISSAC] And when I grow up, I don't know if I want to follow in his footsteps. [MELANCHOLY PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [ISAAC SNIFFS] Bye, Dad. - [BRIAN] Six months, okay? - [ISAAC] Okay. [KISS] [BRIAN] Once I'm back we're gonna have all kinds of fun, alright? [ISAAC CRYING] - [BRIAN] You gotta do it. - [ISAAC] Okay. [BRIAN] As soon as I get on that plane, the sooner you're gonna stop crying, right? - [ISAAC] Really? - [BRIAN] Come on. Be tough. [PATTING] [BRIAN] Hey, you know why Dad's doing this, okay? [ISAAC CRYING] - [BRIAN] I gotta go. I'm gonna miss you. - [ISAAC] Love you, Dad. [BRIAN] You guys go with Grandma and Grandpa, okay? - [BRIAN] Love you guys. - [BOYS CRYING] [SOBBING] [MAN] Keep your chin up. [ISAAC] Love you, Dad. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [BRIAN] My dad wanted one of his kids in the military and I was the last one so it was kind of me by default. [GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] - [GRASS RUSTLING] - [BIRDS CHIRPING] [BRIAN] I'm very glad I deployed 'cause I'm part of something bigger than myself. You know what my biggest fear is? Isaac says he's got a buddy at school, that his dad went to Iraq and he changed. I don't want to be that dad. I wanna be the same fun dad, you know, that... We don't get half our security deposit back because we shot all the Airsoft rounds in the house 'cause we had Airsoft fights inside the house or too many water fights and it got on the walls. That's the dad I want to be. I want to come home and have fun and not, you know, scream and yell at my kids. So, yeah. [MOTOR RUMBLING] [CHILD HOWLING] [YELPING] [SNIFFS] [BRANCHES SNAPPING] I think I saw one just flying behind that tree over there. [ISAAC] Sometimes I try to think about different things. 'Cause if I think about my dad, like... it's hard to... I'm sorry. [GASPS] It's like hard to kind of, like, hard to stay strong. [GUN FIRES] Oh, I think I got it! Put the safety back on. Yes! My dad is, like, the only one that I, like... practically love the most right now. [INHALES] He said that he'll be all right and don't worry about him. "Just worry about you." I worry about my dad at night. Because it's, like, dark and they can sneak. And then they can go... [SHOOTING] [BRIAN] I miss the boys, and I know they're thinking about me. Isaac says it on the phone when I call him. "Dad, I saw the moon, same moon you saw nine hours before me" and, you know, cheesy stuff like that. But, yeah, I miss him. [BIRDS CHIRPING] - [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] - [GUNFIRE] [SOLDIER SHOUTING] [MEN SHOUTING] [SOLDIERS PANTING] [DISTANT GUNFIRE] [SOLDIER SHOUTING] [GUNFIRE GROWS LOUDER] [RAPID GUNFIRE] [INDISTINCT DIALOGUE] [BRIAN] All I remember is snap, snap, burn, chainsaw. [RAPID FIRE MUSIC] [SOFT TONE] [QUIET INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [BRIAN GROANING] [MACHINE BEEPING] [SIGHS] [EXHALES] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [DOCTOR] It might be a little tender. - [SNIPS] - [BRIAN GROANS] [GROANING] Ow! [BRIAN] We were raiding a Taliban-held village and an Afghan police officer got hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. He was dying. I don't care if people say he wasn't one of us or not. He was on our side and I'm going to get him. I didn't go out there to get shot. I went out there to get that guy out of there. It didn't work out that way. My medic saved my life and his. [SIGHS] [DOCTOR] When you stand up... Everything... that's the pins and needles. [DOCTOR] And that's why you get lightheaded because the vessels that keep the pressure, your blood pressure normalized and keep it pumping the way it's supposed to, are not working. [BRIAN] In the long run, they were trying to tell me that if it comes to a point where you cannot run with your leg, they can amputate. [LAUGHS] You're not taking my leg! No, that's my leg. It's mine. I got it. [BUZZING] Turn around the other way? Can one of you guys come over here and steer me? I can't get in. [QUIET INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [ISAAC] Here you go. [MUSIC SWELLING] [ISAAC] It's weird. I haven't cried once. It's kind of, like, not real. Like, it was hard thinking he actually got shot by a real bullet from a real gun from a real person. And I'm like, kinda messed me up a little. All right, Daddy. Let's get you going. [ISAAC] It's a relief that he's not over there, but gonna probably have a limp for the rest of his life. Like, every time I see him limping, it's gonna... I'm probably gonna feel a little queasy. [BRIAN] Ouch! "My dad is a American soldier. My dad is a hero. "My superhero." [JOEY] When my dad got shot, I just wanted to go to Afghanistan and shoot the guys. "Hey, you shot my dad. I kill you." [LAUGHS] [MACHINE WHIRRING] Hold your breath. Hold still, please. [ELECTRONIC TONE] [MACHINE WINDS DOWN] [ELECTRONIC TONE] - [FANFARE] - [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING AND WHOOPING] [APPLAUSE GROWS LOUDER] [MAN OVER MIC] Once again, congratulations on a job very well done. [VOICE FROM TV] [ISAAC] Dad, how do you sync songs to your iPad? - Hit sync? - [JOEY SNEEZES] - [JOEY SNIFFS] - [BRIAN LAUGHS] - What? - [ISAAC] Where? It doesn't show me. [BRIAN] It should be bottom-right. [BRIAN AND ISAAC TALKING] [JOEY] Oh, crap! [BEEPING] [JOEY] Dad. [BRIAN] What, buddy? [JOEY] It was dripping. [BRIAN] He won't slurp it. He won't... He won't do it. [BRIAN LAUGHING] Just drink the rest of it. All this? [BRIAN] If you want to slurp it, go ahead. You need to take a shower and get changed and your bus comes in 25 minutes. Seriously, I can walk it. I love you. It's hard to explain, but like, I'm feeling really patriotic right now. It's weird. I feel a little more grown-up. Like, I want to help a lot. I can handle it. Oh, you look great. - What? - You look like a red-headed stepchild. [BRIAN] I'm trying to get back to where I was. You know, I got just over 17 years in so I want to stay on active duty. I don't want to say, "Okay, I'm wounded, I'm getting out." [CHILDREN TALKING] - Go. - [MAN IN KARATE CLASS] Be a good partner! I'm trying to put on the happy face and the strong guy, but you know, at the end of the day, you know, I'm almost in tears in pain. [LAUGHS] It hurts. [KARATE COACH GIVING INSTRUCTIONS] [BRIAN] Me and the boys, we love camping. We love fishing. If I'm not able to do the things we did before, that's gonna hit me kind of hard. So, I'm set on forward progress. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [KEYS JINGLING] [BRIAN] I gotta go. [WOMAN] All right, guys. All right, man. [BRIAN] Love you. [ISAAC] The last few years have been a bit rough. I don't really want to say things fell apart, but we didn't do as much together because he was limited. I'm used to my dad being super-active with us and he can't really do that anymore and I feel really bad for him. [JOEY] Right when he left this morning, I was kinda excited that he'd not have so much pain. And I was a little scared that something would go wrong. [BRIAN] Just throbbing, back and forth. [BREATHING DEEPLY] [BRIAN] For the past three years, I lived my life with a lot of pain, lack of mobility, weight gain, and not being able to do stuff with my kids. But now that's all gonna change. [MACHINE BEEPING] [SIGHING] - [WOMAN] How's the pain right now? - It's not good, and I don't like to whine, you know. [WOMAN] We called them. They're gonna come see you. - [MACHINE CONTINUES BEEPING] - [BRIAN] You mean... [WOMAN] Unfortunately, 'cause right now you're maxed out on what you can have as far as the fentanyl goes. Pardon my French, but it fucking hurts. [LAUGHS] Feels like I just got my leg cut off. [BOTH LAUGHING] [ISAAC] I feel my dad will get a lot better. I feel he's gonna be a 60-year-old guy that still runs marathons. So, I'm really proud of him. [LAUGHS] [BRIAN] Thank you for everything. [GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [MARIA] There, Stumpy. [LAUGHS] [FUNNY VOICE] What are you looking at? [BRIAN, IN FUNNY VOICE] Hey, lady, what are you looking at? [MARIA LAUGHING] [BRIAN] I gotta use rubbing compound to get that off. [ISAAC] Joey, the side's a little bit sharp. [BRIAN] The doctor said within five weeks, I'll be in my first leg. I'm moving forward. Let's go. [WIND RUSHING] [EMOTIONAL PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [BRIAN] I just saw a four-pounder swim right by the boat. [BRIAN] I think all my self-worth comes from physical stuff, like what I can and can't do physically. I probably should've just got it amputated from the start, but I had to try. Right now, I still have two amazing boys and I got Maria. - What is it? - That's raspberry. - It's two scoops of raspberry. - Isn't that good? [MARIA] I was not at all looking for a relationship. I didn't think I was ready for a relationship. I just wanted to, you know, to meet people but I just think God had a different... a different plan for me. It was instant sparks. Instant sparks. I mean, just, how could you not, just talking to him? [MARIA LAUGHING] [MARIA] You do that? When you get mad at me, you tighten up your jaw? [LAUGHS] [SILVERWARE CLATTERING] [BRIAN] Hey. Get your asses up. Joey, get up. [BRIAN] It's a change. We went from me and the two boys to her and her three kids. But only one of her kids stays with us 'cause the other one's 18, living with his father and 20, living on her own. [BRIAN] You're wearing that to school today? - Yes. - [BRIAN] No, 'cause you slept in that! [JORDAN GROANING] [BRIAN] Joey and Jordan are the same age and they're completely two opposite kids, but I think they're starting to learn how to get along together. [MARIA] Just don't hurt each other, guys. That's what boys do. [BOYS STRUGGLING] - [JOEY] Wait! You can't... - [MARIA] No, your hand was right here and it's on an awkward angle. - [JOEY LAUGHS] - Oh, it's here. What's so funny? [BOTH LAUGHING] I had shoes on that day! - Oh, yeah. - [BOTH LAUGH] [BRIAN] Joey took to Maria so damn quick. He took to her a lot quicker than I did. I was like, "Okay, we'll see how this goes." - [MARIA] If you fall, fall towards me. - Watch out. Got it. Learning curves, learning curves. [BANGING] [ISAAC] It's weird seeing my dad lopsided. [BRIAN] Start making a box. Now angle it. - [ISAAC] Angle it? - [BRIAN] Angle it. Go across from the corners. Yep. [BRIAN] Isaac really wants to help Dad. He doesn't want to do stuff with me, he wants to do stuff for me. Joey, on the other hand, he loves doing stuff with Dad. [BOYS PLAYING] I think Joey is a lot more like me because he's just hardheaded. But Isaac is out to make Dad proud of him. [ALL LAUGHING] [MARIA] It was awesome. You all right, buddy? [CRICKETS] [BRIAN] Okay. Right. Okay, so some of these pains I'm feeling will desensitize over time? Okay. [VOICE FROM TV] [BRIAN] Okay. Well, I appreciate it. You kind of set my mind at ease a little bit. Nice. [BRIAN] Okay. Thank you so much. All right. Bye-bye. [BRIAN] I absolutely wish I was still in the Army. You know, I had some power. I had some authority. I had an identity. And now, uh, you know, who am I? Why couldn't they rent you a go-kart or something? Why? I don't need one. [BAGPIPES PLAYING] [BRIAN] Remember what I said, you go around and check out all the shops and then at the end you decide what you want to see. [BRIAN] There you go. Joey. [JOEY] That's cool. [MARIA] One more. Do it again. [ALL LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] [WOMEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY] [BRIAN] Isaac, if you wanna run around and have fun... I know you're dedicated to Dad and everything, but if you want to go have fun, you're more than welcome to. - [MAN] Thank you for serving. - Appreciate it. Awesome. I retired out of Fort Drum. - [MAN] Fort Drum? - Yeah. - [MAN] Can I ask a question? - [BRIAN] Yeah. - [MAN] Was it worth it? Losing your leg? - Oh, yeah. I mean, this happened during a contact. We got ambushed. - So will you do a prosthetic eventually? - Yep, three weeks. - Oh, cool. - I got to cut off a week and a half ago, and I'm already in less pain than I was with the leg after I got shot. Prosthetics have come so far, man. And it's right out of Syracuse. [MAN 2] Uh, excuse us. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Well, I feel like they're feeling sorry for me. [PEOPLE TALKING] Are we going to sit down? No. Nope. It's your turn. - It's my turn? - Yep, it's your turn. Go. Go. You can step up here if you want to get some pictures next to her. Yeah, I don't know. [GRUNTS] Oh, my God, are you do... Are you all right? What are you doing? [BRIAN, SHAKILY] I've been wanting to do this for a very long time. [BRIAN GASPING] [MARIA] Oh, my God! Right now? [BRIAN CRYING] Right now. [MARIA CRYING] Oh, my God. Will you be my wife? [MARIA CRYING] Yes! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] Do I look okay? - [WOMAN] Stop talking. - [ALL LAUGHING] Do another one. - Do I look okay in all seriousness? - [ALL] Yes. My makeup's not running? Okay. [GENTLE PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] - [SHUTTER CLICKS] - Come on, give me a kiss. [WOMAN LAUGHING] - [CHUCKLES] - [SHUTTER CLICKS] [MARIA] I hope I get a fish. I'm gonna squeal like a little girl. - What? - [MARIA] I hope I get a fish. [MARIA] Oh! What the hell? - [BRIAN LAUGHING] I got a bigger one. - [MARIA] No fair-sy. Nice catch, babe. [BRIAN] That's three. - [MARIA] Nice. - [WATER SPLASHING] - I got one! I got one! - [BRIAN] You got one! Good! [LAUGHS] I did it! Can I kiss him? Bye, buddy. [WATER SPLASHES] [MARIA] Look at that sexy man right there. Good Lord. [SHUTTER CLICKS] [LAUGHING] [FUNNY VOICE] I got your picture. [STUDENTS TALKING] [ISAAC] This is gonna sound weird, but I still worry about losing my dad. That it's possible anything can happen. It definitely makes me more emotional at times. I'll be laying in bed. Everybody gets these feelings, you'll be in bed, ready to sleep and think, "Hey, let's think of the worst thing in life you can think of." It's like, "Really, you want to make me think about that right now?" So I just try not thinking about things more than I should. [WHISTLE] [SLAPPING] [WHISTLE] [THUD] [WHISTLE] [APPLAUSE] [PANTING] [FABRIC RUSTLING] [DOCTOR] Any changes you feel like with the wound? - I'm getting mad. - You're getting mad? Okay, why are you getting mad? 'Cause I... [LAUGHS] Dried it out, you know, I've been doing everything he says to do... - Yeah. - And it just keeps doing the same crap. Well, sometimes there's delayed healing. [BRIAN] Yeah, well, there's not delayed mental anguish. [DOCTOR] Well, that's normal, so everybody goes through the same thing. Yep. You still got an area there, don't you? [BRIAN] I don't know what else to do... It's gotta heal. I mean, you're doing what you're supposed to be doing. It's just gotta heal, that's the problem, so. [WOMAN] It's not good to jump the gun and go into your prosthesis without a fully 100%-healed incision. Awesome. I'll come back in March. Oh, no. You're not that far away from healing, sir. You're not. I was told that a month ago. I was told next week. Then the next week I was told next week. How long do I stay motivated? 'Cause this is four "next weeks" in a row. - [WOMAN] Why would you... - We said... You're not the one banging into freakin' doorjambs every day getting pissed off at the girlfriend and the kids. I mean, I'm yelling at you. I'm yelling through you 'cause I don't even know you. I'm getting pissed. [WOMAN] I think that you have set up some unrealistic expectations. I don't set unrealistic goals. [WOMAN] You think you can have your leg amputated and be 100% healed. It's obvious you don't know me. [ELEVATOR DINGS] [GUNFIRE AND BLASTING FROM COMPUTER GAME] - [GUNFIRE] - [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSIVE BLASTS] [EXPLOSION] [BRIAN] Joey, get them dishes done. Just get it done so it's done and then you can chill out. [DISHES CLINKING] [WATER RUNNING] [MARIA] This sucks. Looking good, Joey. I just swept this area. How do you make this room so messy so fast? [MARIA] I don't know if it's because he's just bored because he can't move around. I don't know if it's PTSD, but when we're home, ninety percent of the time and he'll probably disagree with me but 90% of the time he's playing a stupid video game. And he's not engaging with us as a family. [GUNFIRE] [MARIA] All mismatched socks. - [JOEY] I don't care. - Wait a minute. Hang on, here you go. What do you mean you don't care? I care. [JOEY] Put them together. If they're the same brand, - just put them together. - Here, this one matches. I do the laundry up in this house. Get out of my basket. Get out of my basket. [JOEY] Wait, one minute. I just got my... - [BRIAN] Joey. - [JOEY LAUGHING] [MARIA] Out of my basket. [DOG BARKING] [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] [BRIAN] Sometimes I feel guilty because I'm not mission-capable anymore. Like now I'm a burden to the VA and to the military because now they had to treat me and take care of me and now I'm, you know, collecting benefits. I'm just a "use-to-could." I can't do any of that stuff anymore so I call it "I-used-to-could" do that stuff. [REPORTER SPEAKING ON TV] [DRAMATIC TV THEME MUSIC] Isaac, get done what you need to get done and get the hell out of here. Every time it's down to the wire. I'm not driving your ass to school. [ISAAC] Since the surgery and recovering, everything's stressful. He's a lot more on edge lately. Before he got shot, he wasn't really depressed. But now I'm scared that he's... gonna be sitting in a chair when he's 65, 70 just depressed. [REPORTER CONTINUES TO SPEAK ON TV] [MAN] Try and click. One click. [CLICKS] - [MARIA] And that's what you do? - That's all I do. [EXHALES] - Alright. - [DOCTOR] Good. Now let's have you do a little bit of walking back and forth. [WOMAN] You're independent walking, you're independent with the stairs. If, when you do that, have both crutches. [BRIAN] Okay. [BRIAN] Not used to turning around yet. [LAUGHING] This vehicle makes wide right turns. [LAUGHS] [BOYS TALKING] [CLATTERING] [CREAKING] [BRIAN STRAINING] - [CREAKING CONTINUES] - [BRIAN PANTING] I can't get my foot out. [CLATTERING] [BRIAN INHALES DEEPLY] Fuck you, snowblower. [CHOIR SINGING "THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER"] - [WHISTLES] - [SHOUTING] - [SHOUTING CONTINUES] - [WHISTLE] [BRIAN] Come on, Joey! Stand up! Stand up! There you go. You gotta get the takedown. Up! Up! Not your back, Joey. Peel and look away! Peel and look away! Go, Joey. Turn into it. Turn towards me. Turn towards... You don't take that. You go out there and wrestle smart and hard. You gotta get some aggression in your head. - This is not the big leagues right now. - [REPLIES INDISTINCTLY] Listen to me. These kids are starting to take this seriously. If you want to wrestle good, you gotta wrestle hard. - Okay, you can't be out there... - I know. - Pussyfooting and dancing around. - I know that. [JOEY] My dad was a wrestler. And now I am. My day was actually really good at wrestling and I think it was his senior year, he went, like, 26 wins and 3 losses. But now he can't help me, like show me the moves. Joey doesn't have enough ferocity. It's like, "Get mad. It's okay." - Yeah. - Go out there, controlled chaos. - Right. - You know? I just don't get it. They just don't get.. You know, they don't have that... - [GROWLS] - Right. [BRIAN] It's all I did since I was six. It's just I can't get on the mat. I'm too scared of my leg. [CROWD SHOUTING] Yeah, you gotta go absolutely apeshit on that kid in the blue. Wrestle hard. Stay off your back. - [WHISTLE BLOWS] - [BRIAN] How bad do you want it, buddy? [WHISTLE BLOWS] [BRIAN] Get off your back! What is he doing? Are you kidding me? Why is he crying? You got this, buddy. Get mad! Joey, stop crying. I don't know why he's crying. I don't like that. Go get changed. Are you okay? Do you want to win? That's why you gotta put in the effort, alright? - Okay? I'm proud of you. - [JOEY SNIFFLING] [BRIAN] I wanna look at that knee on the way home. Alright? Let's go. [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] Sometimes when I sit in bed, I'll be thinking about how good of a wrestler I could be if he didn't get shot. [GARAGE DOOR CLOSES NOISILY] [TOOLS CLINKING] [RATTLING] [SNIFFS] Oh, there we go again, leaving all the shovels. What is my... pipe wrench doing out there? I don't know. You didn't use my pipe wrench? I was breaking ice with it. It goes back in the garage. When are you guys gonna start taking care of stuff? We didn't drive 100 yards. My pipe wrench is out, the snow shovels are still in the yard, I got a glove blowing across the road. - [BRIAN] Start taking care of your crap. - [ISAAC] I didn't know where it went. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] [ISAAC] I don't mean to sound like a crybaby, but I've been through a lot. I mean, sacrificing yourself to go fight a war for your country is definitely a noble cause. But at the same time I'm not sure his injuries for the rest of his life were worth it all. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [STUDENTS TALKING] [ISAAC] When I get out of high school I wanna go to college and then be a police officer. When I was younger, I was always 100% military. Let's go, let's go. Military. Put on a uniform and go overseas, but when I actually thought about it, I'd like to be close to family. I do want to have kids eventually and I don't want my kids to go through what I went through. I'm pretty sure that they'd want a dad around more than... anything else. [SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [BRIAN] If there is a negative that's come out of this with the boys, I don't see it. Either I don't see it or I refuse to see it. I got some mentally-strong boys. That kid keeps staring at me. I might go punch him in his left eye. Why are you looking at me? [CLAMORING] [JOEY] Wow. [GUNFIRE] Oops. - Oops. - [GUNFIRE] [JOEY] I really like the military life and that's kinda got me into wanting to join the Army 'cause I love the Army life. I probably won't even graduate, I'll probably join when I'm 17. I want to run around, shooting guns. Doing fun stuff. Seeing all the cool stuff. Like, I bet you we'll be in a really cool war somewhere else. [RAPID GUNFIRE] [JOEY] I'd feel okay with getting shot in the middle of a battle. I bet you it wouldn't feel good but I'd know I did something right. I mean, it would scare me for him to get hurt or even killed in the line of duty overseas, but if that's what he wants to go do and fight, then so be it. That's what he goes to do. It's just losing family doesn't seem very appealing to me. [SHOOTING CONTINUES] [JOEY] Like that? [JORDAN] I see you. [SNOWBALL THUDS] [JORDAN] Dang it. - [GUN COCKS] - [SHOOTS] [LAUGHTER] [ISAAC] I got him! [BOYS LAUGHTER] [BRIAN] Every parent wants more for their kid. The area we live in is not a rich community. There's not a lot of good income jobs. Even the nuclear plant's closing. So, you know, there's even less jobs now. [JOEY SIGHS] [BRIAN] Isaac wants to go to college for criminal justice and he's gonna become a cop. I already know that's not gonna happen. I don't mean to burst his bubble, but he does not have the grades to get into a college. And when they send me a note home that says, "Help your son with his homework," I have no idea how to do the shit they're doing in school these days. No clue. Where I really see Isaac and I hope he does it now, I see him joining the Army. I don't think any parent wants their kid to join the military out of love. But in the military, if you do your job, you're gonna get promoted. So what did you guys do in school today, Joey and Jordan? Me and Marshall were playing pickleball... Marshall and I. [BOYS LAUGHING] [ISAAC] Dad, what day are you leaving? For what? - [ISAAC] For wherever you have to go? - That morning. [ISAAC] Okay. Just checking to make sure you weren't leaving before my birthday. Do you know what the good thing is about March 6th? [MARIA] What? Twelve months after that, if he's not enlisted in the Army or enrolled in school, that's 400 a month. - [MARIA] Does he know this? - He knows. What's the rule, Isaac? When you turn 18, what's the rule? [ISAAC] Army or college. I'm going to college. You better be enrolled. [ISAAC] I'm going. Everybody's doubting me. I know I'm going to college. That's a fact. And he doesn't believe me. [BRIAN] I think I'll be signing some recruitment papers - in a year and a half. - [ISAAC] I'm going to college. - [BRIAN] Wanna make a bet on that? - Yeah. - [BRIAN] You're gonna graduate college? - Handshake. - [MARIA] I don't know. - [BRIAN] Four hundred bucks. Yep. [MARIA] I agree, I don't know if you'll do it. That pisses me off that you think that. - [MARIA] Well, not... - It really does. [MARIA] Not because I don't think you're smart. I just don't think that you'll go through with it. No, I'm going through with it. [BRIAN] Part of me wanted to go to college too, but I didn't have the grade point. When I graduated, I was in the National Guard, I was working at Walmart and my dad said, "You're not working at Walmart for the rest of your life." So I went active duty. Literally that fast. [MARIA] We'd like to do the 6:30 for American Sniper, please. [CASHIER] How old's the kids? [BRIAN] Sixteen, twelve, eleven and military. [CASHIER] So, five tickets altogether is $42.50. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] See that little truck there? I used to drive that. It was fun. [GUNFIRE] - [SHOOTING] - [SHOUTING] [GUNFIRE] [EXPLOSIVE BOOMING] [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] [BOOMING] [BRIAN] I'm always gonna think about that day. [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [BRIAN] I think about, you know, the guys in the platoon, how they're doing now, how they were then. I don't know, it's like your mind races at night. I'll figure it out. My way. [CREAKING] [DOCTOR] You're gonna have to figure out how to do this the best way, Brian. Um... You gotta basically pull down on here while you work your way in there. [RUBBING] [DOCTOR] It's a little tricky, huh? You got it. - [BRIAN] I gotta learn somehow. - [DOCTOR] Yeah. - [CREAKING] - [MARIA] Is this something I can with? - [DOCTOR] Yeah, you can do it. - [MARIA] Do you want me to pull on that? - [DOCTOR] He wants to do it himself. - [BRIAN SIGHS, CHUCKLES] [MARIA] Did you give me a dirty look? - I gave you the stink eye. - [MARIA] Why? 'Cause I want to try this myself. [MARIA] Well then, that's all you need to say. Oh, my gosh, Brian. Look at you. [BRIAN] I don't even know how to run. I haven't done it in four years. - [MARIA] That's okay. I'm so excited! - [DOCTOR] Yeah. - Turn it to the side a bit. - [BRIAN] Like that? [BRIAN] No, I like this. This is really comfortable, you did good. - [DOCTOR] Good. - [BRIAN] Yeah. I'm gonna look funny running, I think, but I don't care as long as I can run. Alright. Happy. - [KISSING] - [MARIA] Love you. - Brian! - It's slippery right there. Brian. Oh, my gosh! We just got to get to the concrete. [SNOW CRUNCHING] [BRIAN] Gotta start somewhere. [JOEY] Damn! There's snow on my new shoes. Just make sure you stay off the road when cars are coming, all right? - [MARIA] Alright. - [BRIAN] Let's do this. [MARIA] You ready? [BRIAN] I don't know, I'll tell you in a minute. [BRIAN] I can actually stride. You look good from back here. [BRIAN BREATHING HEAVILY] Brian? I start hitting and... [EXHALES SHARPLY] I start hitting, it hits here and I totally lose rhythm. [BRIAN BREATHING HEAVILY] [PROSTHETIC CLICKS ON GROUND] [BRIAN] I'm hitting all over the fucking place, damn it. [SIGHS] Alright. Going home. [PANTING] I feel clumsy right now. Wasn't what I wanted on my first run, that's for sure. [MARIA] It's a big step for you. [BRIAN] I ran! [TREADMILL WHIRRING] [GENTLE PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT TALKING] [BRIAN] Winters got pretty boring I guess, and you know, living way out in the country, when it snowed, there's not a lot to do. Opportunity came knocking at my door and Maria actually talked me into it. I think she knows me better than I know me, but she's like, "You need a hobby, you need something to do in the winter and I think it's right up your alley." And I now own Tricky Phish Bait Company, so I make bass-fishing soft plastics. [DRIZZLING RAIN] [BREEZE BLOWING] [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] [BRIAN] Get 'em up. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SIZZLING] [BRIAN] The important things in life, I think now, family. There's no holes. There's no rips. There's no tears. It's just strong. I want my family to be happy and have everything they need. [PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] Wow. Ooh. I feel good. Do I have to put on an undershirt? I was gonna put a sock on this guy, but I don't think it matters. Yes, you will wear an undershirt, 'cause you're gonna be sweating and it'll see-through on that shirt. [BRIAN] I've been married before and I guess you don't know till you know. 'Cause when I got married the first time, I thought it was for the right reasons. And then you get to this point and you're like, "No, this is the right reason. This is how it's supposed to be." [ISAAC] I used to call Maria "Maria," but now, I think I might be calling her "Mom," after I realized she's here to stay. Sorry. [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] I promise to be faithful to you and to love only you. [BRIAN CRYING] As long as you promise to love bass fishing and the Green Bay Packers. [LAUGHTER] [MARIA] I promise that I will accept you as you are even with all your flaws, and your faults. [LAUGHTER] There's many, but I love you. Not only is this commitment to you, but it's to Isaac and Joey. I plan on being a permanent motherly figure to your boys and to love them as much as I do Alanna, Brandon, and Jordan. I, in accordance with the authority vested in me by the laws of State of New York, pronounce that you're husband and wife. You ready for this? - Heck yes. - You can kiss. [APPLAUSE] [MAN] And now, ladies and gentlemen, would everyone please welcome the new Mr. and Mrs. Eisch! Yeah! [CHEERING] Welcome to the family and hope you like your new last name. - [LAUGHTER] - [APPLAUSE] You're not smashing this cake in my face... - No! I'm not. - Promise? [CROWD WHOOPING] [SHOCKED LAUGHTER] As you can see up here, we decided to make it all about our family. My best man is also my first-born son. Isaac... I'm sorry if I get sentimental. Just forget you heard it. [LAUGHTER] [BRIAN] You continue to impress me every day. You've managed to fight through some hard struggles that we've been through. You've put up with my asshole-ness, my stern ways, and you're still growing into quite the fine, young man. Some days, I wonder what else you're gonna break, because you've already broken my four-wheeler, my lawnmower, my snowblower, and you managed to back into Jason's brand-new Dodge Dart. [LAUGHTER] [BRIAN] But I love you just the same. We move on to Joey, otherwise known as the stinky kid. [LAUGHTER] Joey is my hardheaded prodigy. He's my youngest son. He's the reason that my hair on my chin is starting to turn gray and why I have high blood pressure. I see qualities in you that make me wanna strangle the crap out of you sometimes but I know later in life, these qualities will make you a leader in the world someday.

[MARIA SOBBING] [MARIA CRYING] [SOBS] [MARIA] Oh, my God, no! [CRYING] [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [REPORTER] Early this afternoon, 12-year-old Joey Eisch, was struck by a truck while he was riding his bicycle. He was rushed to Upstate Hospital, but that's where he died. Deputies are still investigating exactly how this happened. [MAN] Caskets for the younger people, for five-foot, five-foot-six, four-foot. They go in six-inch increments. This would work good for you. [BRIAN] Yeah. - [MARIA] He was so patriotic... - [BRIAN] He's my splitting image. [MARA] And he was so "American." [BRIAN LAUGHS] - He wanted to be in the military like Dad. - [MARIA] He dreamed of joining the Army. That was his goal, his dream. He said, "I don't have to do good in school, Dad, I'm joining the Army." [LAUGHS] I'm like, "That's not true." [LAUGHS] [MAN] So, we'll figure out what we're gonna do, where the services are gonna take place, okay? But we'll talk about that in just a minute, okay? We're gonna finish this part of it and then we'll get into the service part. Okay. So, Joey's gonna be survived by - his father, Brian... - [BRIAN SOBBING] I know. [BRIAN SOBS] [BRIAN] Oh, Joey, my baby. [BRIAN SNIFFLING] [GRUNTING AND SHOUTING] Fuck! [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] [WOMAN] We are gathered here today to celebrate the life of a beautiful child, made in God's love and image, who was named Joseph Eisch, born into this loving family for just a brief moment in time. [MUSIC SWELLING] [BRIAN] Joey, we love you. Three, two, one... - [MARIA] Love you, Joey! - [CHEERING] - [BRIAN] Love you, buddy. - [BOY] Peace out! [MUSIC FADES OUT] - [BREEZE BLOWING] - [CRICKETS] [BRIAN] So from the point where the flowers are, three quarters way up the hill is where his body was found. [ISAAC] But the flowers are already where the bike first hit. The bike hit here. And his body was... right here. [ISAAC] I'm kinda numb right now. With what happened with Joey, I mean, I'm all cried out from the first night in the hospital. I sat with him until his heart stopped. I mean, now I don't even really try to hide it. I just kinda zone out. [MARIA] Isaac, you know, it's almost noon? [ISAAC] Yeah? Alright, start thinking about waking up. You can help me. I gotta finish that room today. [PAINTBRUSH ROLLING] [MARIA] Joey's accident was almost three weeks ago tomorrow. And I have this need, I don't know why, I don't understand it, but I wanna paint every room in this house, like, I wanna make it different. [BRIAN] I don't think the family will ever be back where it was. I think we'll reach a... a sense of normalcy, I guess, but, you know, he's always gonna be in our heads. [CRYING] [CAR ENGINE RUNNING, SHUTS OFF] - [IGNITION TURNING] - [SEAT BELTS UNBUCKLING] This is probably gonna upset you. Nothing really bothers me anymore 'cause if something bad happens, I'm gonna be with him sooner. So I hope that doesn't offend you, but... I think that's pretty selfish of you. Okay. Sorry. [TV NEWS, IN THE BACKGROUND] [BRIAN] You up? Your bus comes in, like, 20 minutes. [ISAAC] I can see the bus route... [BRIAN] But you need to be out there. Just in case. Yay! Senior year. [SHUTTER CLICKS] [BRIAN] Smile. It's your last first day of school ever! [ISAAC] Yeah. They just said that. Love you. Bye. - [SIZZLING] - [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [SILVERWARE CLANKING] - [MARIA] Isaac, did you wash your hands? - Yeah. - [MARIA] Did not. - [ISAAC] I did. You wanna fight about it? [MARIA] Not at school. I meant within the last three minutes. [SOFT ROCK PLAYING] [SILVERWARE CLINKING] [ISAAC] It was definitely hard to have a father that did so much in his life, for me to catch up to that. I fully believe that if Joey was still here today, you know, he'd be my dad's successful story. [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING] [OFFICER] Okay. Once you sign this, this is the job that you deserve. This is the job that he wants and this is the job that you will get. Here. Sign your name. - [ISAAC] Just a signature? - [OFFICER] Yep. Just signed my life away. [LAUGHS] Pretty much. I was dead set on going to college and now I'm dead set on enlisting in the military. It felt like something Joey really wanted to do. And it felt like something I needed to do. [MAN] Raise your right hand. [OFFICER] Repeat after me. - I, state your full name... - I, Isaac James Eisch... - [OFFICER] do solemnly swear or affirm... - [ISAAC] do solemnly swear... - to support and defend... - to support and defend... - the Constitution of the United States. - The Constitution of the United States - against all enemies, foreign and domestic. - Against all enemies, foreign and domestic - and that I'll obey the orders. - And that I'll obey the orders - of the President of the United States. - Of the President of the United States - and the officers appointed over me. - And the officers appointed over me. - So help me God. - So help me God. [OFFICER] Congratulations. [BRIAN] I'm extremely proud of him. From what I know, it's fourth generation straight that's joined the Army. [BRIAN] Good job. - Maria. - [MARIA] I'll take one of those. - You said you weren't gonna cry. Stop it. - [MARIA] No. I'm not... I didn't cry. [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING] [BRIAN] You getting dressed here? No. I'm wearing jeans and boots and a T-shirt down to her house. Putting the tux in the back seat. [BRIAN] What about dinner? There's prime rib at the pr... At the dance or whatever you call it. - [BRIAN] You eat there? - Yeah, prime rib, that's why ticket's are $50 a piece. - [BRIAN] Well, that's freaking nice. - Right? [UPLIFTING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [BRIAN] Do not lose these. [MARIA] Oh, my God. You guys are just frickin' cute! - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [SHUTTER CLICKS] [LAUGHTER] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [MARIA] Have fun. - [GIRL] Bye, guys. [ADULTS TALKING] [MUSIC SWELLING] [APPLAUSE] [WOMAN] Isaac James Eisch. [APPLAUSE, CHEERING] - Are you okay? - No. [MARIA LAUGHS] [WOMAN] I present to you, the class of 2016. - [CHEERING] - [APPLAUSE] - [MARIA LAUGHS] - [FIRECRACKERS BLAST] [FIREWORKS SIZZLE] [BRIAN] Why is everything done at the last fuckin' second? [ISAAC] What're you talking about? I have 'em right here. [BRIAN] This is a packing list! You pack stuff up so you don't have to do it ten minutes before somebody arrives. [ISAAC] Ten minutes left, and I'm gone for... [BRIAN] It should've been done fuckin' yesterday. [ISAAC] He told us half this stuff, we don't even need. That's why I'm... Then they need to change the fuckin' sheet. 'Cause the sheet says "minimum requirements." Where's the "Future Soldier Bag"? "All items must fit into the Army Future Soldier Bag." [ISAAC] So fuckin' difficult. Shit. [GRUNTING] All the shit I bitched at you about... fuckin' I hope some of it sinks in. I'm not going to war. I'm going to learn how to do war. [LAUGHING] [BRIAN] I figured I'd say goodbye here... Remember what I told you, you can cry all you want, the minute you pull out of that driveway, [CLICKS TONGUE] shut it off. Time to grow up. Okay? You're doing it for you and Joey and nobody else. - [ISAAC] Okay. - Got it? [ISAAC] Yep. I'll give you one last... [LAUGHING] [BRIAN] Good luck. - [BRIAN] Good luck. - Love you guys. Do the right thing. [VIOLIN MUSIC PLAYING] - [MARIA] You all right? - Yeah. I'm proud of him. [BOTH CRYING] He'll be all right. He's still my son. - [MARIA] Of course. He's your son... - [BRIAN] Yeah, I know. He's my first born, I'm, you know... But it's not that I'm upset easily. You know, I'm just... I don't know. Kinda... 'Cause he's out of the house. I'm happy for him. Yeah. [MARIA] He's in a whole new... I mean, that's the goal. Your kids... What, you want your kids to grow up to live with you for your whole life? [CHUCKLES] No. You raise 'em to successfully leave the nest. And I think he has successfully left the nest. Successfully. Successfully. Right? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [LAUGHTER] - [RECRUITS TALKING] Come on. Keep going. You got this! You got this! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [BRIAN] I don't know what I'm looking at. [DOCTOR] Gestational sac is the small sac... And the yolk sac is that other spot I see? [DOCTOR] Yolk sac is a very translucent... This is the yolk sac right over here. Oh, okay. Is it still, like, too early to see, like, a heartbeat flickering right now? I know you can't tell me, but... - [BRIAN] No, you can see it. - You can see it. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. [CRYING] Yay! - [BRIAN] You happy? - Yeah. I was worried there wasn't anything in there. Baby Eisch. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SUPPORTIVE CHEERING] [SUPPORTIVE CHEERING CONTINUES] [BRIAN OVER PHONE] Hey, Issac. How you doing? Oh, sorry, Private Eisch. Mom and I have something to tell you. Go ahead, Mom. We got our results today. Baby's perfectly healthy. No Down's syndrome or Chromio... - How do you say that... - Issues. Issues. So, baby's perfectly healthy. And we found out today that we are having... - Jaxon. - A boy. No girl. You got another little brother coming. Now do some damn push-ups. - [MARIA] We love and miss you. - [BRIAN] Hope you're doing good. - [MARIA] Bye, honey. - [BRIAN] Love you. Bye. [LAUGHS] [RAPID GUNFIRE] [BOOMING EXPLOSIONS] [GUNFIRE] [GUNSHOTS] [INDISTINCT RADIO] - [EXPLOSION] - [GUNFIRE] [ISAAC] I'm gonna be honest, I don't know too much about the war in Afghanistan directly. I don't know what started the war in Afghanistan. I don't know if Al-Qaeda is based in Afghanistan. I don't really follow that side of politics too much. I don't really follow why wars happen. All I know is, I love my country. [MAN] All right, so, a couple things I want you to know before we reunite you. Your soldiers have went through a transformation process, both physically and mentally. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [ISAAC] I just wish my little brother was here, that's all.

[BRIAN] He is so cute... isn't he? - Happy there? - [MARIA] Yeah. Hi, Jaxon. [BRIAN LAUGHING] Look at his little squat little nose! Welcome to the world. I was a good boy. You remember listening to me? Cradle his head underneath your elbow. And then you wanna kinda roll him in there. Right there. Jaxon Joseph. You know, he's got Joey as his middle name. [BRIAN] He brought us out of a really dark place. It's a gift, and I think it's Joey's way of telling us it's okay to be happy. [HORNS PLAYING FANFARE] [ISAAC] I feel like in the military, yes, it's a great career, but it's not everything that it looked like when I was knee-high to a grasshopper, you know. [SHOUTING FROM VIDEO GAME] - [SIREN] - [EXPLOSION] [ISAAC] I'll be honest, I've been dealing with a little bit of, uh... little bit of depression for about a year now. I don't know where it came from. Maybe a result of my mother leaving. Maybe a result of my dad getting shot, getting deployed, I don't know. Joey, I don't know. It just hit. It's hard to open up to my dad when he can't relate, you know. He's just... He's better at dealing with things I guess, than I am. [QUIET PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [BRIAN] I think we still got a good bond, but... I tell him all the time, "You don't have to call me every day." Well, now he doesn't call me every day and I'm like, "God, I wish Isaac would call me more." [DOOR CREAKING] [BRIAN] Fuck! - Hey, buddy! How was your day? - [JAXON GIGGLING] All right, let's get in the truck, okay? Get in the truck? Yeah. Jax, do you think Mom's at home? - [BABBLING] - [BRIAN] Yeah. You wanna run in and see her? - [BABBLING] - [BRIAN] Yeah? All right. [CHUCKLES] [BRIAN] I think one of the hard things about being a boy is being tough enough. I want my little banner-banner to be a tough little shit. And I do want him to serve. [JAXON AND BRIAN SHOUTING] Okay, come on. - [JAXON VOCALIZING] - [BRIAN GROANING] [BRIAN] Come on, let's go get Mom. It's been what, five years now since I got amputated. It's tough to see other amputees running marathons when not one lap around Walmart and Brian's gotta sit down, 'cause I just can't go on. [MARIA] Don't let Brian fool you. He's not doing good. He's angry. He's angry about our son being dead. He's angry about being a "used-to-could." He's pissed off that he can't walk around. He doesn't feel manly, he doesn't feel masculine enough. I don't know what to do for him. [BRIAN] The war in Afghanistan has been going on for 18 years now, since 2001. Well, about a year ago, I saw some stuff on news about the town square I used to patrol. Some bad guys had taken over that sector, whatever. So that kinda hits you a little hard. You know, what was the purpose of it? [MUSIC SWELLING] [BRIAN] You always think back, "Would you change something?" Or "Would you have done this different?" It's over now. It's all stories. [SNIFFLING] Just keep going. It's all you can do. And fill your days with more happiness than sadness. [MAN] Good job. - Eisch. - [ISAAC] Morning, Sergeant. [SERGEANT] Morning. [WHISPERING] You forgot to shave. That's off. That's off. Boots look good. [ISAAC] I know my dad is proud of me for joining the military, but I do feel like I'm letting him down sometimes because I'm not living up to what he did. I mean, I'm already two and a half years into career, what do I have to show for it? I'm just the bottom-of-the-line soldier. [OFFICER SHOUTING] [ISAAC] But I do wanna go to war... someday. This is what I was grown up to do. [MUSIC FADES OUT]
