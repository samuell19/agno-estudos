What started off as an unknown virus in Wuhan, China has exploded into a worldwide pandemic. Until recently, most people had never heard of COVID-19, otherwise known as coronavirus. As the death toll continues to rise around the world, governments have taken extreme measures in countries like Italy, where a mandatory closing of all business has taken place. People around the world have been ordered to stay home. In country after country, travel restrictions have been put in place. Events with large gatherings have been canceled. Self-quarantine, stock market plunges, medical professionals trying to make sense of it all as they work to find a vaccine. And as this modern-day plague continues across the globe, one question is on everyone's mind: can anyone find a way to stop this? Oh man. So glad to get home. Hey, don't. Oh my gosh, you know how great it is to be home? Yeah, good... We needed a vacation from a vacation. You had a good time though, didn't you babe? Of course! You know what, we always have good anniversary vacations. They're always fun! Well here's to 30 more. Hey. Hey babe, would you like something to drink? Yeah, some water would be great! All right, coming up! You know, I was gonna ask ya, do you think we could get a couple of those pictures from the ocean and get 'em blown up into maybe eight by 10s? For my dad, I just think he'd enjoy looking at the ocean. You know he sits in that room all day. He does, I think it's a great idea. You know what, it's been a while since we've seen the grandkids. Yeah. And I need to go see my father tomorrow. Well, let's go pick them up on the way over there. - Let's do that. - You know how much Sarah would love to see Max. You wanna do it? - Yes! - Come on. - Let's do it baby. - Awesome. How are we doing today Max? Anxious to see the family. Especially the girls. I see. Well, you go ahead and make sure you take these, okay. Yeah, yeah. I don't see the point, really, Katie. I'm not gonna live that much longer anyway. Oh stop, a negative attitude never helped anybody. I'm sure the girls will cheer you up. I'll check back up on you later, okay. Okay. Papa! Hey, Allie, Sarah! How are my two little sweeties? Hey Dad, how are you? How are you doing today Dad? I'm doing better now. Came by to check on your inheritance, have you? Positive as always. Hey listen, we brought you back a gift from our trip! You didn't bring me another great grandchild? No, no! It's a watch Dad. Oh! Look. It's a Swiss watch from Europe. Will it tell me how much time I've got left? You know, the real gift of life is these two. How would both of you like to go out and feed the ducks? Yay! You think you really should be going out Dad? Oh cocky poo, I'll be dead tomorrow anyway. Oh Dad. We have to go. We're meeting James and Naomi for lunch. We just wanted to stop by, give you the watch and let the girls say hello. Pizza grandpa? Can we feed the ducks pizza? I don't think that's... You can feed those ducks anything you want sweetie! We have to go now Dad, I'll talk to you later. Bye Papa. - Love you Papa! - Bye sweetheart. I love you too baby. - Let's go. - See ya. - Bye Dad. - Bye! Love you. - Bye. - Bye, love you! Grandma and grandpa took us to see Papa. Oh, did you two have fun? And Papa said we could feed the ducks some pizza. That old man will let Sarah and Allie do anything they want. Good evening everyone, Bruce? Tony. James. How are ya? It's good to see you James, it's been a long time. Yes it has. Does that mean Bruce is gonna pay the bill? Could be Tony. Could be. Well thank you for coming in. Appreciate seeing everybody, have a good night. - Thank you. - You too. - Bye. - Bye. So how's Pop doing Dad? Nothing's changed. He still thinks I'm after , after his money. Honey, are you all right? Here, drink some water. I hope it's not that crap virus. What's that James, the coronavirus? Yes. I have a better chance of winning the lottery. Dad, you need to take this seriously! You and Mom did just get back from Europe. You know things are worse over there than they are here. I'm not sick Naomi. Let me check and see how you're doing honey. - I said I'm okay! - Okay! As a matter of fact, I'm ready to go! I need to get back to work tomorrow. - Dad. - Ooh, touchy. You think I'm touchy? I am touchy! Because I just lost a major account this week due to this flu panic! It's not panic to be cautious. It is panic! People are losing their minds! Look at social media. All the naysayers and do-sayers and dumb asses! They're going crazy on there. Dad... The place is a panic! You have all the conspiracy theorists and all the downers and uppers and everything else, it's panic! A million people die every year from accidents, but nobody shuts down the freeways! This is different! It is? Because 50,000 people die a year from the flu! And I don't see the world economy shutting down because of the flu! It's not the same thing! How do you know? How do you know? Because I think I know the difference between the flu and a plague! Please! The kids? I'm sorry babies. I had a hard day at work. It's okay grandpa. Can I help too grandpa? No baby, not this time. But thank you so much. I'm out of here. I'm sorry guys. Naomi, I'll give you a call tomorrow, okay. - Okay Mom, be safe. - I love you. - See you tomorrow! - Tell grandpa I love him. - Love you. - Same! - Bye. - Bye. He is becoming more like Papa every day. Man, it's good to be back. Dave, what's up? Welcome back! You got a minute? Absolutely, come on in, have a seat. You okay buddy? Oh yeah, I'm great. What's on your mind? How was your trip? Ah, Laura and I had a fantastic time. Man, I saw places I never thought I'd see! And you know, I think you'd love the beer in Europe because it's not even close to watered down like here in the states. You're not, you're not here to talk about my vacation are you? Well, I'm happy you had a nice time, but... But what? The company has to make some hard decisions given the current situation. What situation? The virus Bruce! The stock markets are going in the tank, the staff's a little concerned about our fiscal health. They wanna know if anyone's willing to come take some time off. Hey man, I just got back from two weeks off. Yeah, I know Bruce. You're not asking me, are you Dave? Bruce, I'm sorry. It's just for a couple more weeks until this thing cools off. Thanks buddy. I knew you'd understand. Say hi to Laura. Right, I will do that. It could be worse. They could be shutting down everything all together. Over this? It's no worse than the flu! Babe, that's not what they're saying! As this pandemic continues to worsen across the country... I think the whole damn thing's a joke. To temporarily shut down to contain the spread. - And now, - Latest of which, - I have two weeks off - Disneyland and Disney World. and nowhere to go. Even Mickey Mouse is scared of this. I think he should ditch Sneezy and make sure Doc hangs around. Is this a joke to you? The whole freaking thing is a joke. You know what, then turn it off. Why don't you do something tomorrow a little different okay. Why don't you go hiking? Get your mind off of it, all right? Come on! You know, I'm gonna do that. You're gonna stop watching television? No, I'm gonna go hiking. Okay good, let's go hiking then. - Beautiful. - I'll go with you. Thank you. Oh man! You haven't been to church in a few weeks. Laura and I just got back from vacation. Well sounds like a great trip. Oh, it was. Where'd you go? Oh man, I saw so many countries and places, I don't even know where to begin. Aren't you concerned? About what? The virus that's going around! Not really, I think it's blown out of proportion, don't you? No, I don't think it's blown out of proportion at all. Oh come on Jason! The media's been blowing this up since it started! Look, it might be only one bullet in the gun, but I'm not playing Russian roulette either. You know, I think the media's shooting blanks. They're creating a panic for no reason! I think maybe they found a better way to promote their ratings than politics. I don't think it'd be a bad idea if we lost a few of them. A few what? Politicians! That's a bit rough don't you think? I'll tell you what's a bit rough. It's the thought of having to use sandpaper to wipe my ass because all these crazy fools are out there buying up the toilet paper in a panic! Ouch! I may not be able to sit the rest of the day. Well I gotta sit down 'cause I'm out of breath. You're usually in a lot better shape than this Bruce. You okay? Yeah Jason, I'm okay. I'm fine. Well I'm beat. Enough fresh air for the day don't you think? Awe man. Hey sweetie, are you done already? I think I wore Jason out! God, I guess. You okay? Why does everybody keep asking me that? It seems like everywhere I go everyone asks if I'm okay! Fine! You know what, Max called while you were out and he doesn't sound good. What's wrong with the old man now? There's nothing wrong with him, he just wants to talk. There's always something wrong with my Dad. He's either sick, or he's tired, well I'm sick and tired of hearing about it! Babe. I mean, listen, Bruce, we know you love your Dad as much any of the family does, okay? But you don't know how much time he has left. So you need to think about that. Life is short. All right, he's not always easy to get along with, but listen, think about the time you have to go see him and make sure you go see him. I'm serious. The main symptoms of coronavirus include dry cough, fever, and difficulties in breathing. If you're experiencing any of this, - they highly recommend - Oh my goodness. That you stay home and isolate yourself. Why'd you turn it off? Babe, frankly, I'm tired of seeing that too! You know, you need to call a doctor. I'm not sick. You know what, you may not be sick, but I don't wanna get sick either. Okay? Mommy, can we go swimming? Well, sure. Go change. Yay! New book? Mom called with some concerns about Dad. Oh. She's concerned he might be sick. Sick, with what? Dad doesn't wanna talk about it. So he won't see a doctor? He doesn't even wanna talk to Mom about it James. Do you really think he'll go see a doctor? Hang on. Hi Mom. No. Bruce. Bruce! Max's facility called today. Your Dad's tested positive for coronavirus. You need to see a doctor. You hear me? Babe. Bruce Gunther. Babe, it's gonna be okay. Hey Bruce, how are we doing? Not good. Why? I think I need to get tested for the coronavirus. Oh my. What's wrong? The care facility that my father's at, they notified me that he tested positive for the virus. Okay. I was just there last week visiting my Father! Whoa! All right don't worry about it, I'll get you a test, go home, self-quarantine. On the way out, don't touch anything. What happened? Let's go. I don't know honey, let's just see what we need to do. I don't know what we're gonna do about this whole hoarding thing. People are going around just taking stuff like they're preparing for the end of time. Like they're not, it's just crazy. Excuse me, can you tell me where the water is? Yes, it's on the front shelf up front. Front shelf? Perfect, thank you so much. Oh look, there's one water babe. - One case? - One water. - Are you kidding me? - And look, there's. Yeah, there's toilet paper too. What are people thinking? Excuse me! Oh, excuse me! Whatever! - Take it! - Seriously! Do people actually realize that this is a respiratory and not a gastrointestinal virus? Why would anyone need that many rolls of toilet paper? Evidently she does. Let her have it. At least we have two weeks, right? I think. Maybe. Let's go. Honey, let's just get out of here. Get the water. Did you know when you sent that test off? I think it was about three days... You all right? I think about three days ago. We should get the results any time. Ah, there's the doctor now. Hello doc. Yes. I've been okay I guess. Really? Okay. Thank you doctor. Well? Positive for the coronavirus. Serious? He said to just take the medication, follow the directions and stay quarantined. That means you got it in Europe. How many people have you been around since then honey? You need to go get tested. Oh no! What! You transmitted that to your Dad! Do you realize that? Hey Max! How are we doing today? I wanna see my sweeties. Oh. Oh no. Max, I'm sorry, your picture broke. And I'm so sorry you can't see your family. Maybe you can visit them through the window? I just hope they will both pull through. Mommy. When can we go see Papa? Soon, hopefully. Your Papa is sick and your Grandpa too. What's wrong? Well, they have a bad virus. You mean like a cold? No. Sort of. It's like a really bad flu. Is he gonna be all right? We're not sure Sarah. I don't want Papa to die! I love my Papa! It's okay babe. Well that's a change. How's that? I never thought I'd see you sleeping on the couch. I don't know how, but you know what, my test came back negative. Oh thank God! It must be all the hand washing you're doing. Naomi, and Jason, and the girls went and got tested, okay. And there's a whole list of who's got tested that you were around when the Health Department called. They let them know. What about my work. Honey, I told them all about your work. Okay, good. You know, I didn't take this seriously, and look at me now. Look, the care center called today and they said Dad's not doing very well. Ever since he's been in that place he's been a pain in the ass! I've avoided seeing him for the last 10 years and now I may not get another chance! Honey. You can't avoid the wind until it blows you over. Let's see how you're doing today, okay? Let's hope for the best. 103.5! That's not good! I'm calling the doctor. It's okay. So don't drive, I'll call the hospital, send somebody as soon as possible, and make sure, clean the house once he's gone. Hello. Hi Mom. Hey Naomi. Are you doing okay? Yeah. Your Dad just left for the hospital right now. Did he drive himself? No honey, he's not driving, no. The ambulance took him. Oh, thank goodness for that. Yeah. I'm worried. No, he's gonna be okay. Did you get your test results in? Yes. Thank God we are all negative. The girls are really upset about Papa. Now, what am I supposed to tell them about Dad? No honey, don't tell them right now. That'll just scare them. Okay? It's gonna be okay. Hey listen, your Dad's phone's ringing right now. I'll give you a call back. I'll talk to you later. All right. - I love you. - I love you. - Bye. - Bye. Hello. Yes. No, he's not here. This is his wife Laura. Oh my God, no! No. Okay. Yeah. Mrs. Gunther? Yes doctor. Yes, I'm Dr. Bahadura, please have a seat. Can I see him? No. Bruce is in isolation. Gonna need to remain in quarantine until he tests negative for the virus. Is he gonna be all right? Well, we certainly hope so. Just know, he has a great team of doctors that are treating him. And I'll keep ya informed as I know more, okay? Thank you doctor. Appreciate it. Doctor! Yes. Do you mind just giving him these? It's the only way if we're gonna be able to communicate for a while. So I appreciate it. Sure. Thanks. Well. We'll wait it out. At least we've got communication. That's good. - That's true. - Yeah. Honey. Papa died last night. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Hello. Who's this? Are you kidding me? How'd you get this number? What? Who was that? It was the press. They're already calling me about your father. Like I don't have enough to deal with. How are we gonna tell Dad? I'll deal with it honey. Don't worry about it. James and I will do anything we can to help with Papa's arrangements. Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you so much, but please, just go home and be with those girls. They need you right now. I love you. I love you too. I love you. I hun! Hi honey. Oh thank God it's you! Who'd you expect, the funeral home? Oh my God, don't say that! It's not even funny. I know. Hey, how are you? About the same. Hard to breathe, fever. You know, all the things that make you wanna be around someone. Well, under the circumstances that's better than the alternatives. I guess so. What are you up to? I'm just cleaning up around the house. I'll tell you one thing, they've been great here. Although I know I haven't been. Nothing like a God smack down to bring you back to reality. Tomorrow I'm gonna have to make the arrangements. What arrangements? I'm sorry hun. I didn't tell you yet. I didn't know how to say this. Say what? Your father died. I'm sorry I didn't tell you in the hospital. I didn't want you to be upset. The funeral's on Saturday. Okay but not that many people could be at the funeral because of the crowd. I gotta go. Love you. I love you too. Max Gunther was a father, a grandfather, and a great-grandfather. He was a man you had to know to appreciate. After his wife Jane died 10 years ago, he didn't seem to tolerate much or wanna deal with many people. But he always loved his family. Especially Allie and Sarah. He was a man who found it hard to show love in the last few years of his life on earth. And often, quarrel with his son Bruce, but he would sometimes share with his caretakers how much he really loved his family. And yes, even Bruce. Remember, as we read Romans eight, verses 35 and 37 through 39. "Who will separate us from the love of Christ? "Will hardship, or distress, "or persecution, or famine, "or nakedness, or peril, or sword?" Or in this case, virus or plague? "No, in all these things "we are more than conquerors "through Him who loved us. "For I am convinced that neither death nor life "nor angels nor rulers, "nor things present, nor things to come, "nor powers, nor height, "nor death, nor anything else in all creation "will be able to separate us from the love of God "in Christ Jesus our Lord." Let us pray. Almighty God, in Your great love, You crafted us by Your hand, and breathed life into us by Your spirit. We commend ourselves and we join with all Your faithful people and the whole company of Heaven in the one unending song of praise. All glory and wisdom and honor be to our God, forever and ever, amen. Please remain seated as the family departs. Yes baby, yeah. Listen, you need to talk to your grandkids and just reassure them. They're scared honey. Please put them on Laura. Okay. Allie and Sarah, Grandpa wants to talk to you. Hi grandpa. Listen girls, I'm gonna be fine. I just have to stay here a little bit longer, until the doctors can heal me. I'm really sorry about Papa. But you know he's in a better place, right? Yes Grandpa. Are you gonna die like Papa? No sweetheart. I'm gonna be just fine. I don't want you to worry about me, okay? Good. Let me talk to Grandma now. I love you both. Bye, love you. Love you Grandpa, bye! Hey honey, talk to you later. I love you Laura. I love you too. Okay, bye. Give Grandma hugs. We all could use it right now. You want a water? No thanks, I don't think so. Mommy. Can we have a Popsicle? No honey, not right now. Go change your clothes. I don't want you playing in them. Next time, you're asking. Allie, Sarah, listen to your mother! I don't know what Mom's gonna do if Dad doesn't pull through? I don't know if she's gonna make it. Really? Your Dad seems like a healthy guy. I'm sure he'll be fine. Look what happened to Papa! And none of us saw that coming! Max was an old man. He doesn't have that much longer to live anyway! That makes me feel so much better. Hi sweetheart. Hey. How are you? I feel like crap! You know, I've had the flu before, but this bug is kicking me in the ass man! Well I'm sorry babe, I've just been going through the mail right now and we got our first medical bill. And everyone is saying it's okay, but I don't know how it's gonna be okay. Who knows when you're gonna get out and we have no money coming in, you know what I mean? How do we know when you're gonna be out and back to work, right? Remember, good things come to those who love the Lord. And to those who are called to His purpose. We'll figure something out. What do you mean purpose? I mean, is it your purpose to sit in a hospital with a stupid virus? Is it my purpose to sit here and deal with these stupid bills? I mean really? Are we really gonna be okay? Huh babe? I'm sorry I'm so sick. Don't be sorry, just get better. I mean, I don't know what to do. Babe, I understand you're sick. I understand, but it's not your fault! Okay, it's not my fault, this is not the hospitals fault, it's not works fault, it's not anybody's fault! But doesn't it have to be somebody's fault? I mean, I'm alone babe! I don't know where to turn to! Don't be afraid baby. Why do you keep telling me to not be afraid! I'm afraid! I can't help it! Babe? I mean, for Christ's sake! You tell me it's gonna be okay, but nobody knows if it's gonna be okay honey. I'm by myself right now! Babe! You know, you can't touch me, I can't touch you, I mean, that's the reality right now babe! You're quarantined, you're away from me and I don't know when it's gonna get better! Baby, what's going on? I mean, that's what's the reality! I'm alone, I'm alone and who's gonna take care of me? You're there, I'm here! I'm fine. And I'm gonna make it! Do you hear me! Babe. Laura! What! I'm gonna make it! I know. Laura! Laura! What baby, I'm sorry. I love you. I love you and I'm gonna make it! Do you understand Laura? All right. - All right. - I'll talk to you later. Okay? I'll talk to you later. Okay. Bye-bye. Bye. Our research tells us this is the home - of Bruce Gunther... - Oh no, no, no, no! This isn't gonna happen! What do you think you're doing here? Hi, this is KRAD News and are you the wife of Bruce Gunther? Yes, that is my husband, but what are you doing here? This is private property! Okay, we have a few questions for you ma'am. Do you mind? Yes I mind! Get out of my private property, do you understand! How long has your husband been sick! - My husband's sick - What are you doing? and you need to take your stupid crew and get out of here! Do you hear me! - We have questions! - Get out of here! - It's a pandemic, okay! - Get out of here! - Look, we're sorry! - Get out of here! But still, get away from me! Good morning Bruce, how ya feeling today? - Not good. - No? Well, the doctor's gonna be in a minute. All right, he'll be right in. Thank you. The death toll continues to rise across the country as leaders and medical officials struggle. You really think watching that's gonna help you out? What's the difference doc? I'm getting worse, not better. I'm feeling worse today. Come on Bruce, being negative is not gonna help you at all. You gotta try and remain positive. We're doing everything we can for you medically, okay. But we're gonna need your help to fight this. I mean, what can I do for you if you just give up? You understand? Now I'm not gonna lie. You're not progressing as we would like, but we've given you the antibiotics, and this extra oxygen should help with your lungs while we continue to try and fight this. Look, I've seen a lot of very sick people live. And I've seen a lot of other patients not make it. But ultimately, it's up to you. And your will to want to survive. Now tell me, when was the last time you ate something? I'm not hungry. Come on Bruce, you gotta try. You gotta keep up your strength. I'll talk to your family and I'll keep them informed of everything. I'm worried about Laura. What would she do without me? Right now, you gotta put all your energy and focus on yourself. Worrying about others is gonna be of no service for you. Am I gonna die doc? Get some rest Bruce. I'll come back and check on you tomorrow. Thank you doctor. Hi Mom. Hi honey, how are you doing? Oh, we're all good here. I just picked up some hand sanitizer. How are you? Good, good, I wanted to tell you I have two packages of toilet paper! Hey! Well I'll see you one roll of toilet paper and raise you for some hand sanitizer. How 'bout that? Sounds good. Listen, the doctor did call me and he wants to talk to me tomorrow in the office. - And I know, - Mom? It can't be good or he would've just told me over the phone. You know what I mean? Yeah, you want me to go with you? Yeah, if you don't mind. Would you please come with me? Yeah. Does eight o'clock work? Yeah, I'd love to pick you up. Thank you so much. All right, I will see you at eight tomorrow. All right, I love you. Love you too honey, - sweet dreams. - See you then. You too. - Thanks, bye. - Bye-bye. Bye. Bruce is not doing as well as we hoped. For another wise healthy man, this really seems to be taking a toll on him. We're doing everything that we can, but he still seems to be failing. Failing? What, what does that mean exactly? I fear that he may be giving up the fight. I think what he needs most right now, is all of you. So please, do everything you can to encourage him. The positive energy will help. I don't know if you're religious or spiritual, and I certainly don't mean to offend anybody but, you may wanna consider praying. We all may just need that. Oh God! Please doctor! Please do what you can to save him! I think you may also wanna just try being as close to him as possible right now. Now, you won't be able to see him personally because he's in quarantine, but through your phone and do whatever you can to help him feel that connection. We're doing the best that we can for him right now. And I think what's best for you is to stay home as much as possible. Now Laura, I understand that you've been tested for the virus and you were negative, correct? Yes, but I haven't been tested since he's been in the hospital, but I don't have any symptoms. Okay, and you? Yes. James, my husband and the girls, Allie and Sarah and I have all been tested and we're clear. Very good. Now, just continue to take every precaution and please, stay in touch with Bruce through your phone, through video chat. Whatever you can to help him feel positive. We'll keep praying. Thank you doctor. Hey. You want me to drive? What? I don't think I wanna be at the house alone for a while. And I, I don't wanna deal with those reporters if I have to either. All right. You know you can stay with us for as long as you like. I know the girls would love to have you stay. What about James? Let me take care of him. Happy wife, happy life, right? Yeah. Oh, let me help you with that. Thank you. Hi James. Mom's going to be staying with us for a little while. Just until Dad can come home. Great! Grandma! Hey sweeties, how are you? Grandma's going to be staying with us for a little while. And Grandpa too? No sweetie, Grandpa's still in the hospital. How is Grandpa doing? We'll talk about that in a little while. Why don't you two take Grandma upstairs so she can get settled in, okay? Let's go girls. Come on Grandma! Go girls! James, will you take the luggage upstairs, please? How long is she gonna be here for? I don't know, I guess it depends on Dad. So it could be a while? James, please, take the luggage upstairs. I don't have the energy to do this right now! Yes Bruce. Staying with Naomi right now at the house. You know what honey, I'm dealing with so much right now I think it's best if I'm with family. And Ally and Sarah love me here. So how long are you gonna be there? If I don't get better soon, you may be there a while. The doctor says my lungs are not doing good. I may be coming down with pneumonia. So I better get out of here soon or you may be there a long time. Bruce, don't say that. That's the last thing I wanna hear from you right now. And you gotta stop worrying about other people. You know Laura, I've had a lot of time to think since I've been in here. And I can't help but feel responsible for Dad's death. Baby, this is not your fault! You know, if we hadn't gone to visit him, he may still be here today. You did not kill your Dad, the virus did! You understand? You've gotta quit thinking that way babe. You didn't plan on having this illness! And we sure didn't know you were gonna have it when we went to visit him. So quit feeling the guilt for Max, okay? You need to stop saying that and start thinking about yourself. Do you understand me? Happy wife, happy life. That's right baby. You have a lot of life left to live Bruce. All right, and I just need you to look up and remember that everyone's going through change. All of us are going through so much change right now. Okay? Yeah. Just know we are praying for you Bruce Gunther. I can't have you give up right now. I love you. Now go get some rest, and I'll talk to you later. I love you too. Mom? Hey honey, good morning. I made you some coffee. I could use it right now. Yeah. So, how's Dad? You up for a walk? Sure. Let's go. Okay. Thank you so much for bringing those extra rolls of toilet paper. We could always use it, especially with it being so hard to find. - I know, ridiculous. - Oh geeze. And hey, you came out with some extra hand sanitizer too. We're not bartering again now are we? What's wrong? Just thinking about your Dad. I don't know. I don't know, I just don't wanna lose him. No. He's gonna be fine Mom. What do you think we should do? Just keep praying right? All we can do is wait now. You think so? Yeah, I think so. Mom, sit down. It just seems like everybody's doing all right. Hey. Do you remember that time when I was little and we were at the lake and that goose chased me all around the lake? I do remember it. I remember that goose was as big as you were, right? But he chased all around the picnic tables and oh, I had to dump a trail of crackers behind me. And you were laughing so hard. Honey, I remember that like it was yesterday. I was laughing, but you know why, also because your Dad, your Dad like ran and he was chasing the goose into the lake. You know he fell in! He was soaked and we couldn't dry him off! It was hilarious. It was hilarious as the wind. Oh, he's always been my protector. How are you doing Mom? Well, nobody's really asked me that until now. It's just like, I'm trying to keep it together because your Dad has to be strong and I'm trying to make sure he's positive. So I just keep encouraging him. I guess I'm doing okay. Just trying to keep your Dad positive. You know what I mean? Yeah. I don't know what I'm gonna do if I lose him. I can't lose him Naomi, I can't. At least your Dad is... Oh Mom. You have always been the strong one in our family. I won't crumble. I'm gonna stay strong. I'm gonna stay strong. Let's go home. Okay. Come on, let's go see the kids. All right. Shall we pray? Yes. Heavenly Father, we thank You for this food and the souls it will refresh. We also thank you for bringing us all together. And dear Lord, we pray for Bruce. We ask that You restore his health and bring him back stronger than he was before. With this, we ask You Lord, praise be to God. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Amen, let's eat. You will wait your turn little lady! Yes ma'am. This is not funny either Sarah. Yeah, it's not funny! Mom! Both of you stop it, right now! Do you hear me? I know we've all been a little tense being in this house for so much time. With James working from home, and the girls are out of school... And now that you're here Laura, we definitely have a full house. I don't wanna be a burden. Mom, you are not a burden! We love having you here. Don't we, James? Yes. Yes we do. We sure do Grandma. You stay here as long as you want. Thank you sweetie. Is everyone gonna be okay? What do you mean? None of us are sick. No, I mean financially. I'm still working. At least for now. Obviously the economy took a big hit! And we're basically all in chaos right now because of the virus! You know, everybody is so frightened of this virus, but we're gonna fix this and move on! You know, fear is gonna be our new enemy. This will soon pass, as long as this fear doesn't bring us all down. Is fear gonna get me? No stupid, fear's gonna get me. Oh no, Mom! Mommy! Stop, right now! And if you don't stop it, you're gonna go straight to bed, understand? And you, Sarah, don't scare your sister. Yes sir. I'm afraid. What's happening? Ally, there's a virus going around the world right now. Like the flu. And we don't know what it's all about, but there are big people working on it right now. And it'll soon be over. You understand? Like when my kitten died? Well, sorta like that. I don't want my Grandpa to die! Honey, Grandpa will be just fine. Just pray to God and let God take care of Grandpa. Okay? I know. I think it'll be good for Dad if we all got together for some FaceTime tomorrow. What do you think Mom? I think that'd be nice. Yeah. Your Father would love to see you. And the kids. How are you feeling this morning Bruce? I feel like this. It's okay, take your time. Let me know what's going on. Something crushing my chest. I see. I can't get enough air in my lungs. Sounds like maybe you're developing some fluid in your lungs. I think we need to get some more antibiotics in him, and let's make 'em a little bit stronger. Yes doctor. Bruce, you gotta keep fighting, okay? I'll come check on you tomorrow. Thank you doctor. Keep fighting! When's the last time we updated the family? I believe it was yesterday doctor. It's just a matter of time. Let's hope these meds work harder than that virus. Right. Thank you. Hi Naomi. We miss you hun! We sure do Grandpa. When are you getting out of the hospital? I'm not sure sweetie. I'm really sick. I wish I was with you all. You are with us Dad. You will always be with us. We love you Grandpa. I love you too Sarah. And all of you. Has the doctor seen you today? Yes, and he seems concerned. What did he say? Look, I don't wanna, I don't wanna mess things up for you guys, but I think there's a pretty good chance I'm not gonna make it through this. You listen to me Bruce Gunther, you have never given up on anything and I'm not about to let you start now! I'm sorry Laura. Sorry for what? You don't have to apologize. You remember what you told me? We work together for those who were called according to His purpose babe. And it's His purpose that you live. And you know what, you have a purpose. And you will pull through! We need you. We do need you. There's so many more ducks to feed! I'm sorry. I can't talk very well right now. We'll try to talk very soon. I love you all. We love you too. I think I need to be alone for a while guys. Mom. So how's your Mom doing? I don't know. I think she's still sleeping. She was up in her room all night. And how are you doing? As well as anyone can be. Under the circumstances. You know, I sure hope this is over soon. I'm ready to get out of this house, return to work. It seems like we're doing everything online now. Ironic really. Our reality has virtually stopped and it's been replaced with virtual reality. And I'm ready to get our lives back together. How much longer is your Mom gonna be staying with us? I don't know James, why? Is that a problem? A problem? We already enough people in this house! Naomi look, I love your Mother, I'm just anxious to get our house back! Ally? Who was at the front door? Grandma. Did she say where she was going? What? Thank you! You're welcome. Ally, be quiet! Where on earth could she be going? And she left her phone. Sorry Father. I didn't know you were there. I didn't realize the door was unlocked. I just needed some time to be alone. Are we ever really alone? Social distancing in its purest form isn't it? Excuse me? Would you like to sit? I would enjoy the company Laura, that is, if you're up to it. Thank you Father. God is always with us, and I've had a lot of talks with Him in the last few days. But it would be nice to speak with someone I can actually see. It's hard sometimes to know what God's plan or purpose is. And we as mortals, often find that purpose hard to accept. We must put our trust and faith in Him, no matter how difficult that may be. Why do you suppose God inflicts pain on those that follow His word, but allows people that don't follow His word to run free? A question for the ages. Why do you imagine He allowed so much pain and suffering to be inflicted on Jesus? Did He not love Him? The true test of faith is not what we do when times are good, but what we do in times of despair. This too shall pass. As everything in this world has come and gone, and so it will be with this pandemic. I don't wanna go on without Bruce. I can assure you, the world will go on in God's time. Whether or not Bruce, you, or I are here to witness it. Through everything there is a purpose. You take care of yourself and those things you can control and let God take care of everything else. I can also assure you, He has things in control, and He is with Bruce as we speak. Thank you Father. I appreciate your time. As I do yours. Excuse me. Do I know you? I don't think so, who are you? I do know you. You're that woman on TV whose husband has coronavirus. Do you know how much jeopardy he has put all of us in? You should be ashamed of yourself! He was supposed to stay home and self-quarantine, but instead, you guys were out running around! We could all be sick! Who knows how many people could be sick because of you people! Just stop that! No, you stop! Shut up! You listen to me! Do you realize my husband didn't ask for this. Do you realize that? And I don't think he'd wanna go around infecting everybody, let alone himself! He would not do that to anyone. Now my family and I are struggling a lot right now, and there's a possibility that he may die! We don't need your ignorance. Ladies, please. We are in God's house. Father, let me handle this! And you, don't even have any empathy for a human being? Lady! I mean seriously! Look where we are. We're at a church for God's sake! Do you realize that? I have looked everywhere James. Have you checked the house yet? Yes, I've checked her house. I even looked in the windows in case her car was in the garage, and she's not there either! This is crazy! Everywhere is closed. There are so many places she could be. So help me James, if anything happens to her... Oh my God! Naomi! Naomi! Naomi are you there! Naomi! I'm okay. I'm here, I'm gonna come home now. Mom! Hi honey. Thank God. Where have you been? I have been looking all over for you! I'm okay. I woulda called but, someone forgot her phone. Yes you did. I was frantic! Don't ever do that to me again! I thought something had happened to you, then I thought, she just went to go see Dad at the hospital. Sorry to upset you Naomi. I just wanted to get alone and have some time to think. And they're not letting me see your Father anyway. And I didn't have my phone to call him. Did the doctor call? No. Where's my phone? It's on the counter in the kitchen. Okay. Why? I don't know, I'm just so upset right now, I just really wanna talk to your Dad. I need to see your Dad. Look, I'm gonna give him a call. Okay. He's not answering. He's probably asleep. Try again tomorrow. Well it's great to have you home Mom. Isn't it, James? Laura, I know I said some horrible things both to you and about you, but I think we can all agree that there's a lot of tension in this household right now. And above all that, I'm truly sorry about what I said and I would love it if you would accept my apology. It's okay James. It's been hard on all of us. Where are the kids? They're upstairs. I'm just gonna go see the girls. Okay. Good morning Mom. Good morning honey. Been trying to call your Dad but he's not answering. He's probably still sleeping. It is early. Yeah, you're right. That's the doctor now, hold on. Good morning doctor. Okay. I know you're trying. It's not good though. Okay. All right, thank you doctor. Mom! Mom, what is it? Mom, what? Mom, what is it, tell me? He just, he told me that your Dad's not improving. He just didn't sound optimistic. Honey, I need to get out of here. Mom. Don't do this to me again. Honey, I just need to go! Okay. Listen, will you let me take Allie and Sarah to the park? Like your Father used to do? Yes, take them. But be back before dinner, and only go to the park. Okay, promise. Okay. - Thank you. - All right. Oh, and one more thing, take your phone with you. It's right here. Those ducks are hungry Grandma. They are. Do you miss Grandpa? I do Sarah. I remember he used to feed the ducks. So do I. Do you think he'll be able to feed the ducks again? I sure hope so. You know what I think grandma? What sweetheart? I think Grandpa's gonna be just fine. You know why he's gonna be just fine? Why honey? 'Cause there's still too many ducks to feed. I agree. All the ducks are done eating now, it's our turn to eat. All right, let's go eat all right. Okay. Come on kids. Mom, I think that's your phone. He hung up. Who? The doctor. Maybe you should call him back. Shh! What? Maybe you should call him back. Sounds like a great idea to me! Shut up! Well I'm afraid it'll be bad news. But I thought he said he wouldn't call you with bad news. He did this morning and he could ask me to come into the office. Did he leave a message? No. Well, you're never gonna know unless you call him back. Oh, James, stop it! Ugh! Mom, Mom what's wrong? Well. You know what, I'm just gonna call him. Hello, may I speak to Dr. Bahadura. This is Laura Gunther. Bruce Gunther, my husband is your patient. Okay. All right, thanks. They got me on hold. Hello, Dr. Bahadura? Really? Okay great. The family's here. Can we put you on speaker? Okay. Well it seems that we've had a bit of a, how should I say this. A surprise this afternoon. Looks like Bruce is gonna pull through. Yes! Thank God! - He's recovering! - Yay! Finally! Dr. Bahadura, can you hear this? Yes I can. And I'm really happy for ya. - Especially Bruce. - Yay! We'll test him over the next couple of days and then, if everything comes back negative, he'll be able to go home then. Thank you doctor, for everything! Wow. - Wow. - Yes. Life back to normal. Hello everyone, happy Sunday. And welcome to those of you in our sanctuary, and those of you streaming from a safe place at home. Today is a special occasion. We are celebrating life. We are celebrating faith. And we are celebrating the power of God. We have a special guest here who had a pretty interesting, almost fatal experience with the COVI-19 virus. I'm very very happy to introduce to you Bruce Gunther. Thank you very much. And even though there are only a few of you here today, and for all of you out there watching from home, we must remember, the church is not a building, but a shared experience. That's what I've been asked to do today. Is to share my experience. A few weeks after Laura and I returned from Europe, I was diagnosed with the coronavirus. Unfortunately, I passed this along to my father, and even though I made it, he was not so fortunate. My father and I did not see eye to eye for most of my life. And things only became more stressful after my Mother died. I wasn't able to attend his funeral, but I miss him everyday. Dad, if you're listening, and I hope that you are Dad, I love you. This past month has not been easy, for me or my family. As well as our nation and the world. A lot of misinformation and negativity is out there. Don't let that scare you, because it will only cause panic, and panic right now will only add to the problem. Even in this time of social distancing, we must come together as one! We are strongest in this country when we have conflicts and a common enemy. And make no mistake about it, this virus is our enemy. America will only ever fail if we fight amongst ourselves. And this is only happened once in our history. Please, let's not let that happen again. I won't stand here and tell you that this was not a horrible experience, because it was. But I will tell you that my family and my faith in God brought me through this. And I love each of you very much. Laura, you are my rock. I know there are those out there that think this is a hoax. But just like faith, just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not there. Be cautious, take precautions, and this too will pass. Having said that, I wanna share something with you that I have never shared with anyone before. I haven't even shared this with my family. Only God knows what I'm about to share with you. When I was in the hospital, on my darkest day, lying in that bed, barely able to breathe, all I could see was ducks. There were so many ducks, and as I lay in bed I could see my family. I could see my grandkids playing with and feeding the ducks. Now some of you may think this is kind of funny, but for me, it was the most important thing in the world. You see, because these ducks, were always at the lake that I used to take my family to. And when we go to this lake, we would have so much fun, just glorious days playing by the water, fishing, feeding the ducks. It was just so overwhelmingly beautiful. And for every duck we fed, I just felt like I was that much more needed. And then I would call Allie and Sarah and I would say, "Sarah, come here, let's feed this duck." And when we did, it made me realize how important I was. To not only the duck, but to my granddaughters, and my family at home. I realized that I didn't wanna die. I wanted to live! So my friends, that's my message. We must remain faithful and positive. And then we can do anything! Because when it comes right down to it, there are so many ducks left to feed. Thank you.
