Yes, I agree. Look. No, no. Harry. Harry, chill out, okay? Just tell him I'm on a job you don't know about. Tell him I went to Tahiti on a mango shoot, okay? No, I gotta go. Harry, I gotta go. Goodbye. Who are you? (synth music) Hi. How you doing today? - Oh! Hey, it's you again. Well, I saw you taking those pictures. Ain't you ever gonna finish? - Not if I keep meeting pretty ladies like you. - Ha! - And her. You seen her around? - Hmm, depends. - On what? - On if you take a nice picture of me like that. Cheese! (laughs) - You got it, I promise. - Yeah, sure. (laughs) I seen him around. - Where is she? - He's a nice guy, saw him yesterday. - Can't you tell me where she is? - Good looking guy, yeah. There we are. - You said you knew where she was. - Didn't say that, just gotta get going here. What can I do? She's upstairs. - What? - In the mission, over there. She won't talk to you. - What do you mean? - You'll see. - Where upstairs, which mission? - I'm taking you there! Jeez! (synth music) That's Lisa. I can't stand here all day. You gonna take my picture or not? Cheese. Cheese. That's gonna work out fine. Yeah. Take a picture and I fixed it. Wonder where my glasses are. (somber music) - Hi. I've been looking for you. I think I saw you down by the old loading docks a couple nights ago. Pretty good at remembering faces. I recognized you from the picture I developed. There were a lot of people standing in line, but I think you were the only one who noticed I was there. My name's Walker Jordan, I'm a photographer. Here's my card. See, I'm thinking about doing a book on life down here on the streets. You know, people stories. Yours, for instance. And I was thinking that maybe, you know, if you didn't mind, I could take... I could just, you know, I could take some portraits of you at my studio. I could pay you. Listen, it's alright, though. You don't have to say anything, it's okay. It's okay, really. - Hey! If you wanna keep that hotshot motorcycle of yours, you better come and save it before they take it away. - Oh Christ. Listen, I'll be right back. (laughs) Alright? Don't go away, okay? Just a minute. Don't move. - I told you she wouldn't say nothing. Don't listen to me, no. (suspenseful music) - Damn it. (answering machine beeps) - [Tim] Yeah, this is Tim calling. Walker, I've been trying to reach you for the last week. Where you been, man? Say, give me a call today at home. I'll see you later, bye. (somber music) - [Walker] They're good, huh? - Yeah, hey, thanks for being on time for the meeting here. I'm dodging bullets in Beirut and you're out here shooting these pictures. What the hell is this? This is very interesting. - It's my book. - Your book? - My book. - Now just when exactly are we planning to start on this cheerful project? - Now. - Now? - [Walker] Right now. - What about the avocados? We got avocados we gotta shoot, you know. - When you need them, Marty? - I need them Friday, end of the day. - See you Friday, Marty. - Just remember, avocados! - [Walker] You got it. - See ya, Marty. (upbeat music) (gloomy music) - A new hero. No reading there? Good. (energetic music) (laughs) (phone rings) Hello. (laughs) Timbo. How's it going? Yeah, I don't believe it, either. Yeah. No, no, no, you are, this is an actual person, you are not talking to a machine. Yeah, wait a minute. (knocking) No, it's the door. One second, hold the phone. (somber music) Come on in. It's okay. Come on in. You got here alright, huh? Well, you got my card. Listen, I was just on the phone. Come on in. Just make yourself at home, and... I'll give you a tour in just a sec. Tim, you're not gonna believe this. I'm gonna have to call you back. Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. Yeah, take it easy. You thirsty? Want some wine? Or how about a beer? Want a beer? Food. Actually, I was just about to make lunch. And I don't have that much, I haven't shopped in a couple weeks. I got pitted ripe olives and America's favorite mustard. However, wait a minute. We have here... What we have here are the fabulous stand-bys, the famous crackers and cheese, and celery. You know, I really didn't think you were gonna come over. I thought you thought I was nuts or something. But I'm glad you're here. Lisa? Lisa? You alright? (shower running) (somber music) How you doing? You okay? Really zonked out there before. Where'd you find that? That's a book I did a long time ago. Used to think these kind of pictures could make a difference, you know? In the scheme of things. That's what I tell myself the camera should do. Problem is, I found out pretty quick that there's not a lot of money in this. Think I sold about six copies. Actually, you see, I just kinda, I just kinda drifted into fashion work. There's definitely money in taking pictures of beautiful women. I'm just at the point in my life now when the pictures have gotta mean something to me. If it means something to somebody else, that's great. So we'll take your picture tomorrow, okay? Okay? There's more of that stuff in the refrigerator. (camera shutter clicks) It's okay. Just relax. It's not gonna hurt. No worse than the dentist. Okay? (knocking) The hell could that be? Listen, why don't you try one of the sweaters in the dressing room, okay? I'll be right back. - [Marty] It's me, you asshole, open up! (insistent knocking) - Good morning, Marty. - You see, I knew if I called, you'd give me the same song and dance you gave Harry, so I came here personally to nail you. Now what is this bullshit, anyway? - Marty. - You won't shoot for me? - Relax, will you? Sit down, I'll give you a cup of coffee. - Hi, I'm Marty Fiore. Oh, by the way, they loved the avocados. What are you doing anyway, robbing the cradle? - Marty, I met her a few days ago. It's strictly platonic, believe me. - Oh, right. Listen, when are you gonna settle down and get married like the rest of us schmucks, eh? Hey, when you talked to Harry, did he mention the fee? - Yes. - Jesus, Walker, I mean, Stevie agreed to do this shoot because I told her you'd be shooting it. She wants you. - Marty, you're a great salesman, but I still pass. - Look, you know the agency loves your work, you know that. Now she has convinced Harvey Galeson, the manufacturer, our client, that you are the only guy for this job. Now he loves your work and he wants you to do it. Really, Walker, you gotta do it. It's two days, you start next Wednesday. Now for the pin wire, it's not big deal. A little sexy lighting, no makeup, nothing. This is terrific, okay? Here, now look here, for the underwear. Abstract backgrounds, now what could be simpler? Our best art director worked on this. Everything is top notch. This is perfect, am I right? - You're always right, Marty. - Hey listen, I remember you when you were this kid schlepping around New York with your "like a" and a beard, and you came to me, and you begged me-- - Marty. Don't give me the "like a". - You pleaded with me. You asked me, you pleaded with me, if you could be on the first shoot. - Marty, give me a break, okay? - I did that for you, didn't I? Alright, listen. I'm cutting the crap now. I've never pushed you like this before, have I? This isn't just because I'm trying to please the client. This is very serious, Walker. If I don't deliver, I'm history. This account, this is our agency's bread and butter account. Without this, the whole agency goes under. - Jesus, Marty! - I'm very serious, Walker. - Beauty marks the spot. Electric daytime lady. - [Marty] Terrific, isn't it? - Alright, leave the stuff here, I'll get right to it. - What a guy. (laughs) Terrific. Oh, it was nice to meet you... - Lisa. - What, does she need an interpreter? - Say goodbye, Marty. - Goodbye Lisa. Hey, listen, I'll see you Wednesday? - Right. - Early. - You got it. - Okay. - I'm doing it again. Damn you, Marty. I don't believe it. More freaking underwear! - It's good to help your friends. - What? You said something. Okay, great, look. I'm going out for some air, okay? You wanna come? C'mon, let's go for a ride. C'mon. (upbeat music) Lisa, these pictures are gonna be great. What's going on? What are you doing? It's crazy to go back there. Isn't it? (timer buzzes) Shit, I gotta get that. Listen, don't move, okay? I wanna talk to you about staying here and working for me. I can pay you! (sorrowful music) - I can't believe she's not here. I was told she was very reliable. - I like your tie. - Thank you. Shirley got this for me. Ah, wait, here they are. Harvey, how you doing? - Hi. - Hi, it's good to see you. - Same here. - Harvey Galeson. Stevie, this is our photographer, Walker Jordan. - Pleased to meet you, I admired your work. - I've been looking forward to this. - Well, I hope I live up to everyone's expectations. - Hey listen, she really put the screws to us to get you, you know. Well, come on Harv, let's let them get acquainted. - How you feeling? - Great. - Good. Listen, we're a little late, so... - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. Let me take you to makeup. - Okay. - That's a great jacket. - Thanks. - Where'd you get it? - Thrift store. - Thrift store? - Mmhmm. - It's great. - Thank you. - Listen, I don't know how you feel about lingerie shoots. - Ehh. - Ehh? (laughs) That's what I thought you were gonna say. Why don't we just have fun out there? - Okay. - Okay? Just pretend it's you and me. - Ooh, early morning fantasies. Delicious. He's cute. - If he's your type. - Oh, he's my type alright. - C'mon Stevie, get undressed. We got a lot of work to do. - So what's his story, is he seeing anyone? - No. He had a big breakup with Audrey Stiles about six months ago. Do you know her? - Yeah, I've seen her around. - Anyway, he's had a few girlfriends since then, but nothing serious. - No?

It's really not for me, it's not my cup of tea. - [Walker] Marty, for once, would you cut the crap? - What crap, what are you talking about? - I think this is my best work. - Your best work? - Yes! - Oh really. Your best work, I think, was the homeless avocados we shot a little while back. That was your best work. - Marty. - This I don't know about. - Marty! - What? - What do you really think of the pictures? - What do I really think? - Yes. - I really think they're terrific. And I really think you finally did it this time. And I'm proud of you. And here's to you. - I'm going to accept that compliment, even though I had to beg for it. - Little Lisa. Why did you ever let her get away? - I had nothing to do with it. - She told Jacques you didn't need her anymore. He offered to take her on, you know, but she never got back to him. He told me she said she wanted her pay donated to one of those missions downtown on Skid Row. She was special, wasn't she? Or did I miss something there? - No, Marty, you didn't miss anything. I think I did.
