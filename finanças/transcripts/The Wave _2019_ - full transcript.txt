Have you ever woken up from a dream so real that for a moment, you can't remember where you are? This is a lot like that. I can remember back when I was in college, me and my buddy, Joel, we signed up to participate in a scientific study. They had this crazy new drug that they believed recreated what happens in your brain when you die. They hypothesized that your brain releases these chemicals as a way of easing the pain of death. Kinda like little psychedelic airbags cushioning your plunge into the great unknown. As I sat there waiting for them to bring me my first dose, I learnt something very important about myself. Turns out, I am terrified of dying. But my buddy, Joel, well, he needed the money. I caught up with him a few days later and he seemed different. I asked him what happened and he just looked at me and said, "Reality is a choice, man." I remember thinking at the time that he'd lost his mind, but now I think I'm finally starting to understand what he meant. And I think it will all become clear just as soon as I find my wallet. - Go for Ralph. - Ralph, buddy, hey. Did you read the breakdown? Yeah, I'm looking at it now. Yeah. Looks pretty ultimate shot, right? This is pretty fucking exciting. - Holy shit! - That's, that is great. If these numbers are correct, you just blew up this quarter's earnings, buddy. I cannot wait to show this to Jonas... Actually, Ralph, if it's all the same, I'd kinda like to present it myself. Oh. You know, get some facetime with Jonas. I bet you would, you little cocksucker. All right, all right. Fine. You earned it. The meeting starts at 9:30. Yes! 9:30 tomorrow works great. The executive conference room upstairs. Conference room, no problem. - Don't be late, Frank. - Yeah, yeah. Frankie, this is huge! I know it's huge, buddy. That's why you hired me, right? Goddamn right! I'm glad you're on my team. Okay, me too. I'll see you tomorrow. - Good news? - The best. About time. How long has it been? Sixteen years. You've only been here six. Not counting the ten I spent at Newman. That's more than a third of my life leading up to this moment right here. Finally. The Warren Claim. I thought this was a simple payout. Yeah. Well... you dig a little deeper and you find all kinds of stuff. You found a discrepancy. I found a misrepresentation. And it kills it? Deader than the policy holder. - Read it. - Yeah, good catch. Fire Lieutenant Warren, 38 Union po..., holy shit! That's one hell of a payout. - Right? - Three dependents. Yeah. Well, they're all dependents, Jeff. I know. I mean. Look at you glowing. We should celebrate. Let's go out. No celebrating for me. I'm presenting to the board tomorrow. We should do this. Tomorrow's a big day and you've earned a little reward. Come on, man. You're supposed to be showing me how it's done. - I can't. - Why? It's Tuesday. And? And you know Cheryl usually hits the gym, picks up some Chinese food and... You see, I don't understand that about you married people, man. What? It's a little specific for an evening with no plans, you know? Okay. Jeff, get to the point. We should go out. We should be partying right now. You should be celebrating. - It's Tuesday! - It's booze-day. That's not a thing. It's gonna be a thing. We're gonna make it a thing. It's gonna be our thing, but, but only if we seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Tuesday. Today. Today is fresh and full of promise! Jeff, listen. I really, I do. I appreciate the offer, but I, I gotta have my head above me tomorrow. It's a big day. Also, there's no way Cheryl's gonna let me out of the house. Lie to her. What? Tell her you're working the Warren file and you gotta be here late. I'm not gonna start lying to my wife, okay? Start lying? Shit! Fuck, dude. I must've sounded like an insensitive asshole to assume that you, a fucking lawyer, would ever bend the truth for the greater good. Yeah, what greater good are we talking about here? Adventure, kind sir. Okay. Adventure. Yeah, I'm gonna pass. Mother... Who is it? Well, the agent over at who actually handles the person's account, called me back personally to tell me that the insured driver, you know? You told me the same... No ice. The glass is dry. Yeah? So you're drinking during the week now? I'm celebrating. Oh! Speaking of celebrating, I'm gonna go with Tammy tomorrow to get a new dress for the wedding. Tomorrow? Mh-mm, and I want to use the gold card. You can't. Why not? I gotta use it to pay the mortgage on Friday. But I, I thought we were gonna use your overtime check from last month to pay the mortgage. Well, we were, but then we went to Hot Springs with your sister. I thought we used the gold card for that. No, the payment for the gold card was late so it wasn't processed in time, so I used the mortgage money. Now, I gotta use the gold card to pay the mortgage. Okay. Well, I need a new dress for the wedding. What's wrong with the dresses you have? What was wrong with the TV you had? This one's got 4K. What the fuck is 4K? It's, it makes, it just makes it better. Yeah. I'm gonna get a new dress tomorrow. Fine. I'll call the bank and have 'em push the payment off to the end of the month, so you can use the gold card. Thank you. I'm gonna go to bed. It's 9:30. Well, I'm tired. And can you remember to take the dog out? Oh, and put a sweater on. It's cold. I'll be okay. It's not for you. Oh, come on. Jeff, hey, man. Uhh... about that adventure... Oh my God! Jeff, oh. Oh, so this is where I play? - Oh God! - Oh, come on. - Oh boy. - Yes! Yes! This is an adventure? No, this is where adventure begins. This is where Hepatitis begins. My friend, true adventure rarely comes freshly scrubbed. Sometimes, you gotta get your hands dirty. Jesus! Hey motherfuckers, how's it going tonight? What the fuck you doing? Yeah. Come on, bud. Hurry up. I gotta introduce you. Hey, I was looking for you. I couldn't find you. I'm gonna introduce you to our new friends. This is Terry and Nat. It's Theresa. - Natalie. - Oh. That's good. - That's what I... - I'm... - That's what I meant. - I'm Frank. - I'm sorry... - Shots! Shots! Shots! New friends require shots. Uhh, Frank, you have to do two and catch up to us 'cause we've... we've been busy. Oh, yeah? Sorry I'm late to the party. Hey, you can have mine. I still have my drink. One more. All the way! Yeah! Now that is done, I'm gonna go get us another round of drinks. - Frank, what's your poison? - Ahh, whiskey, rocks. Whiskey, rocks. - I'll have the same, please. - Okay. I'll come with you. Red should keep something special for me behind the bar. Ah, that sounds intriguing. Uh-huh. Can I have a sip? Well, I don't know. It's generally considered a drink for me. I like her. Yes! Next band on stage for sound check. So? So? What do you do? Uh, I'm an attorney. - An attorney? - Yeah. What are you? Like a public defender? Or are you part of one of those cold, faceless, corporate firms with a name like Reginald, Richter and Satan? Cold, corporate, faceless guy, all the way. Really? Oh yeah. That's kinda fascinating. What kinda law? Corporate law, mostly. Uh, real estate, banks, uh, life insurance policies, foreclosures, bankruptcies, stuff like that. Really sexy. So, you put people out of their homes? No, I don't do that, per se. Uh, my experience is that people usually put themselves out of their own homes. Yeah. All those people, total idiots. There are outside influences, yes. But the key ingredient was people over-leveraging their finances; taking unusually high risks. So, you're saying they got what they deserved? I'm saying you shouldn't mortgage your home to buy a flat screen TV; no matter what the "suggested" value of the home is. Hmm. I can't tell if you're trying to convince me or yourself. I can't tell if it really matters to you. Okay. Your opinion's totally fucked, but hey, at least you have one. Thanks. Most guys are just parroting whatever bullshit their Berkeley professors told them. Yeah? Yeah. This is almost refreshing. I could use a little cynicism towards humanity. So glad I could help. You're completely wrong though. And if I thought for a second you actually believed any of that shit, I'd probably throw my drink in your face. I think that'd be a waste of good whiskey. It'd be a waste of cheap whiskey. I gotta watch my finances. I've got my eye on this new flat screen TV. Oh, yeah. I hear the new 4K is a real something. You got somebody waiting for you? Got your drinks! I have returned with your... - Well, thank you. - Drinks. - Thank you. - Cheers. - What do I owe you? - Nothing. - Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah. - What were you talking about? - Check, check. Frank here was just explaining to me the risks of indulgence. Ah, his usual sexy, bedroom talk. No. I'll have you know that I take plenty of risks all the time. He does. He does. Oh. Hey, shut up. - I'm out on a Tuesday. - Wow! - Wow! - Out on a Tuesday! - Okay. - All right, Vince Neil. Don't party too hard. Who's Vince Neil? - Who's Vince Neil! - Very funny. Okay. In my defense, she was asking me questions and I was answering them. And I think my answers were working, were they not? Eh. Ah, I'm bored. I know a party. Who's in? - You're... - All right. Let's go! - What are we doing? - All right. Let's go. Two, three, four... Oh, thank you. Gosh. I feel like I'm plain overdressed. You look great. Yeah. I feel like people keep looking at me weird. Oh, they're just wondering why I brought my dad. Where's Jeff and Natalie? I don't know. I think they went upstairs. There's a guy. Oh! Whoa! Wow. I haven't done that in years. Do you want to? Yeah. I mean it's, it's cool if it's not your thing. - Don't worry. - Oh no. It's not that. Like I said, I used to. I used to do it all the time back in the day at my old job, but it's actually been a while. Yeah, let's do it. Thumbs up. Whatever. Okay. Cool. Hey, you mind if we find someplace where we can sit and talk? Just getting pushed around a lot in here. Yeah. I think I found some seats in that back room. - Wanna grab one? - Yeah, let's go. Well, yeah. I gotta go to the bathroom, but I'll meet you there. Oh. Shit. Sorry. Oh, yes. Oh, hello. Do you partake, baby? Oh, you... you must be the guy. Uh, no, I'm just waiting for a friend. I don't usually, but please, snort away. I'm Frank. And you're...? Well, apparently, I'm the guy. Yeah. I mean, no. I didn't, no. I, that's not what I meant. You know what? It's all cool, man. I have been the guy before. I'm Aeolus. Oh. Nice to meet you. Is it? Uh, yeah. It is. So where, where's your friend? Ah, friends, friends actually. I came with a few people. It's funny. I actually thought two of them were with you. Are these your friends? Yeah. No. So... you're gonna have a line, baby? Umm... you don't mind? You feel better? Yeah, much. I haven't done that in a while. Done what? Oh. Guess now I'm the one who's late to the party. Oh no. You know what? It was just like a thing, sir, but I can pay. I'd love to buy another. Please, it's not necessary. It's like I said, I'm not that guy. Oh. - That's very generous. - It's not just for you. This man here has to relax. Snorting lines of coke is a good way to relax? You know what? You're not wrong. Now, I have something very special for you. It's going to help you with your struggles. The only thing I'm struggling with is how fucking awesome I feel right now. No, you're not. Don't you kid yourself, boy. You're struggling. This here is enough for both of you. What is it? It's a hallucinogenic. Like mushrooms? Have you done mushrooms? Yeah. Me too. Yeah, something like that. Look, we're all on it. Okay. I'm in. What have I got to lose? Phew! Yeah. Yeah, we can try it if you want, but I-I just did a line so I'm like, I'm bullet-proof. I'm good. Oh, you still feel nervous? But if you're nervous, I'm more than happy to do it with the young lady. How do we take it? Well, the giver puts the tiniest of drops on the tip of their tongue and then kisses the receiver. And when their tongues meet, so do they. I'm in. You are? Yeah. I'm in. Let's do this. Take a, take a risk. So, who's going first? I will. Come here, beautiful. Remember, keep it at the tip of your tongue. Well, my, my, my! That wasn't so bad now, was it? You know what? That's gonna help you find your way. Oh, fuck. What? Oh, it's just later than I thought it was. How long until this stuff is supposed to kick in? It's gonna hit you like a wave. Fuck. What the fuck? Fuck. Oh, God. The fuck? Hi. Sorry. Yeah, I didn't do, I didn't do that. I didn't do any of this. Just so you know, it's not my mess. I... No, no, no. It's okay. I... I'm not gonna hurt you. I don't mean any harm. I just... I need to borrow a cell phone. Yes, thank you. Hello? Police? Friend of the. Hey! Hey! Hey, can you take me to Palm and Gregory, please? - The Hills? - Yeah. Do you have any idea where you are? Ah! I really don't. Listen, friend, for a ride that long, you have to pay in advance. - Son of a bitch! - Excuse me? No, no, no. Sorry, not you. I just, I just realized he took my fucking wallet. - Oh, fuck's sake. - No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Listen, listen, listen. Please, please. You're not gonna believe this, but I swear to God I'm not lying. I was just drugged and robbed, okay? I just woke up in a strange house, I have no idea where I am, I have no idea how to get home. My phone is dead. No way of calling for help. In an hour and a half, I have the biggest meeting of my life. I will lose my job if I'm not there in an hour. You can leave me here if you want to. I understand. I'd probably do the same thing, but just know that you are leaving behind a man who desperately needs your help. A man who can pay you double as soon as you take him to his house. Come on, man. What would Jesus do? Well, I believe Jesus would charge your dumb ass - a triple fare. - Yes. Yes! Okay. That's, that's a deal. - Thank you. Great. - Great. That'd be 115 dollars. Times three. Great. Wait right here. I'll be right back. Okay. Okay. Oh fuck! Cheryl? Cheryl honey, the chain is on the door. Cheryl, can you open the door, please? - Where have you been? - Sorry. Hey. Do you have any idea what time it is? Yeah. I honestly don't. I only know that I'm seriously late for a very important meeting. Hey. Well, I've been trying to call you, Frank! My phone's been dead for hours. Do you have any money? - What? - Money! Do you have some? I, I think there might be some in my purse. Purse. Okay. Frank! You're not even gonna tell me what's going on? You know, this is ridiculous. I was up all night waiting for you. I mean, come on! - Fuck! - Frank! What is... Do you have any more? Do you have any more? - No. - Shit! Fuck. So, look, I promise you I'm not trying to short you. I only have 296 dollars in the house. I genuinely thought there was more, but this is, it's all I have. Please? For the church. It's not good karma to shortchange a church, baby. Not after the night you had. What? What did you call me? Don't worry about it. I'll let a man in need slide on his debt, but you better get yourself in order. You got a big day ahead of you. - All right. - Don't wanna be late. So, do you wanna tell me what happened now? Oh Jesus! Frank! You answer me this instant! Oh, I don't know, Cheryl. Some, you know, I got called in late to work, like I told you, and I was about to leave, and Jeff is like, "Oh, we should get a bite to eat." And I was fucking starving so... - Wait! Jeff Ward? - I went. The Jeff that broke up with Marsha two months ago? - Who's Marsha? Marsha! Come on! My friend from Book Club. She went to the Christmas party and your friend, Jeff, asked me to introduce him to her, said she looked tasty. So, then they dated and he wouldn't commit. So, she went over there to confront him and he was with another woman. And then he goes, "Oh, well, we were never really together." - That Jeff! - Yeah, that Jeff. - Where's the dry-cleaning? - It's in the laundry room. Anyway, that Jeff and I, we go to a bar with some of his friends. He meets them there and they're all drinking. And they drag me, because he was my ride, dragged me to this fucking party. Oh, a party? And you couldn't call me and just like invite me? Well, Cheryl, I told you, my phone was dead. Besides, it was really late and I didn't want to be there, okay? So, I'm at this thing, I'm miserable and alone and the last thing I remember was how much I didn't wanna be there. So next thing I know, I'm waking up and I'm in a fucking empty house and my goddamn wallet's gone. Oh, so you got so drunk, you just passed out? What! No, Cheryl. This is what I'm saying, I was drugged. Whoa! Whoa! You son of a bitch! You're cheating on me. What! Babe! Hold on! Calm down! Oh, so you're gonna tell me you weren't with another woman? 'Cause I can smell the bitch on your fucking clothes! Wait, wait, wait. Cheryl. Cheryl, I can explain. Cheryl, oh my God! Frank? Oh, thank God. You almost missed your big day, baby. You're needed in the conference room like right now. - Oh. - Coffee? Hey, what, what, what happened last night? I was gonna ask you the same thing. You disappeared. I assumed you were having an adventure. Warren file. Move. - Knock 'em dead, baby. - What? Go. Go! Go! Don't make me hit it one more time. What? What? What? Oh, yeah. Shit. You know what? I don't wanna do that. You do that. You got some shit right here. Oh, right. - You're ready? - Yes. All right. Here we go. Knock 'em dead, baby. One, two... ...GDP this quarter and the trend is... Glad you could join us, Frank. - Sorry, I... - It's fine. Harris is finished anyway. Sure, it's fine. Good. Now that we're all gathered, you begin. Barney? Barney, scoot that easel. Now Frank, I believe you were gonna explain why you kept us waiting. Yes, of course. I, I am so sorry again that I was late. I was mugged. Oh, shit. - You okay? - I'm okay. Yeah. Where did it happen? Was it here? In the parking lot? - No, no. It... - Isn't that just the way? It doesn't matter what you do. You give 'em a dollar anytime they ask for one, but it doesn't matter. They want your fucking blood. - Who wants blood? - You know what? Poor people. Barney, you work for the building. Are they ever gonna fix the cameras in the parking area? The cameras don't work in the parking area? What if something happened? What if someone broke into my car and murdered me? People,. All that matters is, Frank's okay. He's here with us now. - Frank? - I'm fine. I'm a little shaken, obviously, but I'm fine. Sarah? Yeah. Yeah, we were just going to go over new business, specifically this file that you flagged for review. "Firefighter died in his home of a heart attack," the Warren file. Seems pretty cut and dry to me. He was up on his payments. This is a payout. Yeah, but Frank here reported again something very interesting, so please elaborate on that. Yes, Ralph. Of course. So, it seems that four years ago, Fire Lieutenant Warren was a patient of Dr. Klein's in Glendale. It seems that Dr. Klein had put Mr. Warren on a low-grade heart medicine to combat a slight murmur that had shown up on Mr. Warren's EKGs. There's nothing in his file about a pre-existing heart condition. What year did he make this diagnosis? It was 2004, but we got the policy in 2001. If it wasn't a pre-existing condition, then it doesn't change anything. We still have to cash out the policy to his family. Agreed. Seems like a waste of time. Duh! Frank? Yeah. Well, kind of. I mean it, it is. Oh, thank you. So, the doctor diagnosed the problem, but it seems that the medication that he put Mr. Warren on made him sick. What do you mean? In this report from later in 2004, just a couple months after the initial diagnosis, the medication made Mr. Warren dizzy and nauseous. It made it impossible for him to do his job, or difficult. Are you saying the doctor took him off the medicine? No, not exactly. - Here it comes. - The doctor, he acknowledged that the medicine made Mr. Warren ill. But in his report, he also advised against coming off the medicine. Mr. Warren took himself off the medicine to keep his job. That's a very interesting piece of information you uncovered, Frank. Seems that the client had a very important diagnosis ten years ago. And it seems that the client made a choice to ignore the strict instruction of his medical professionals and has very knowingly brought upon himself his own personal untimely demise. It would appear for all intents and purposes that Mr. Warren has committed suicide and our life insurance policies do not cover suicide. I don't know if we can use the term "suicide..." Suicide, suicide... But I believe, for all intents and purposes, this is a willful dissolution of personal policy. Oh my God. You all right? Frank, this is huge. You're a genius, for Christ's sake. The payout was almost four million. The only thing we'll have to return is a portion of his contribution, and to this table right now. That's a true sentence. We can make the case that he was hiding information with intent of committing fraud after he died. We won't have to pay back a fucking cent. It's true. We'll bury them in paperwork. We'll show these cunts we don't take them ruining our company lightly. I don't care if he's got ten fucking kids. They all have dependents! Thanks to you, they won't see a penny. Fuck me on this application, Frank. I'm ready for you. It's a good thing you caught this when you did, Frank. You need to get on that table and plow Sarah's pussy. Yeah, Frank! Fuck Sarah with your semi-erect cock. Ram it in if you have to. Don't wanna fuck Sarah? Fuck Ralph instead. Make him your prison bitch. It doesn't matter. It's this family's lives we're destroying. The doesn't matter. All that matters, Frank... is that we keep the money. We keep the money! This is your big day. Time for you to step forward and accept your reward. God knows you earned it. Hey, man. You okay? You crashed out of that meeting like a crazy person. Something's wrong with me, man. Oh. Something happened at the party last night. You're hung-over. It happens. No, it's not that. I, there was this guy there, this, this weird old guy. He gave me something, like some, some kind of drug. You fucking crazy? You took drugs from a complete stranger? You're lucky he didn't roofie and rape you. Well, that's it. I don't know what happened. I don't know what he gave me. I just know that it's like, it's still happening. I'm like, I'm tripping, man. I'm, I keep seeing shit and hearing shit. Shit that isn't there, but like, but it, but it is. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Do you remember what time you took the drug? It was late. It was like, it was like 4:00 or something. Okay. So that was about eight hours ago. This is good, this is good because if he slipped you LSD, you'll be tripping for like another four hours. This is natural. This is not natural. Believe me. Just need to get you to a safe place so you can calm down. You know what? I'll take you home. - No, no, no. My wife's home. - Yeah. And? And she's not exactly having a pleasant response about me not coming home last night especially since it involved going to a party with a strange woman and maybe getting fucking roofied. Theresa, what about her? Did you see her leave? I hooked up with that Natalie chick, man. I lost both of you at the party. What if, what if the drug was for her? What if he wanted her? Who? Oh shit. The, the fucking old guy. What if he was after her all along? Ah, Frank. You sound so paranoid right now. Yeah. Well, you didn't see what I just saw in that conference room, Jeff. You know how I know? 'Cause if you had, you would not be talking to me about fucking paranoid. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but you've got to calm down. Mr. Winters, your wife's on line three. - Okay. - She says it's important. Yeah, I'll take it in the office. I, I... Cheryl, sweetie... Don't Cheryl, sweetie me, you son of a bitch! Was she worth it? What are you, what are you talking about? Was she worth it, Frank! The gold card was declined. I called the bank. We're overdrawn in every account; every fucking dime. The savings, all of our cards, everything, so I hope you had fun with your little whore last night because she has robbed you blind. Everything okay, buddy? No. No, Jeff. Everything is not okay. I just, I just found out that whoever has my wallet has stolen my entire fucking life. We need to call the cops. - Hm, I can't. - Why? I don't need everyone around here knowing that I'm running a drug-fueled bender the night before the biggest professional day... - Okay. - ...of my fucking life. Feeling better, Frank? Oh, yes sir! Yes. All better, thank you. Yeah. You still look a little pale to me. Why don't you take the rest of the day off? Go home, try and get healthy. Sounds good. Thank you. - But my car... - Oh, right. Right. You were, you were mugged. Yes, sir. Well, Jake here can give you a ride. Won't you, Jake? Yeah. I'm Jake. Yes. I can, I can, I can take you home. - Okay good, thank you. - Okay. Sir, my name is Jeff. Feel better, Frank. Oh, and if you need to take an extra couple days, you know, to get over this, no problem. Take what you need. That's very generous of you. God knows you earned it. We need to find the guy from the party and we need to find him right fucking now. How are we gonna do that? We don't know who threw the party. The girls, we need to find those girls. All right. I got it. Hey, it's you. Got a dollar, man? I, I really don't actually. Someone stole my wallet. Yeah. That sucks. Someone stole my wallet too. Oh, that must be pretty tough. Don't sweat it. I'm good. Yep. You just hang in there and if you're lucky, you'll end up like me. Hey, you want another smoke, baby? What'd you say? I offered you a smoke. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah, thank you. Sorry. You're like the fifth person to call me that today. Probably won't be the last. You're having a big day. See you tomorrow. - Hey! - Hey. - Was she there? - No, no. What the hell? You're smoking now, man? What about that bartender friend? Uh, Red, no. He's not there either. - Shit! - I asked for the number. They wouldn't give it to me, but they said he'll be in a little bit later. You're welcome to wait inside. Yeah, no thanks. I'm good. Buddy, I'm tired, man. I barely slept last night. If it's cool with you, I'm just gonna take a nap in the car. - Yeah. Yeah. - Aren't you tired? I'm really not, at all. - Can I use your charger? - Knock yourself out. Oh, come on. Shit. Oh, come on. Come on. Fuck, man. Why'd you let me sleep so long? I, I must've fallen asleep. Sorry. Well, he should be in there now. Come on. Okay. Oh shit. He's gonna lie right there, huh, man? Natalie, great! Hey, babe. - Where is she? - What? Theresa? We, you, you haven't seen her either? I haven't seen her since I left her with you, asshole. Where the fuck is she? Oh shit! We're looking for her as well. - Fuck! - What do you mean, "As well?" Something happened last night. What the fuck did you do to my friend? Whoa! I did nothing. I swear to God. We were at the party and there was this drug dealer. He gave us something and I blacked out. When I woke up, the party was gone, the drug dealer was gone, my fucking wallet was gone, and your friend was gone. Listen, lady. Someone has just emptied my entire fucking bank account and I need to find out who it was. Would we be here right now if we hurt her? - Right. - Would we be looking for her? Can you please help us? Okay, fine. - Okay. - How can I help? Okay. So, so the guy at the party, the drug dealer, he's the one that gave us the stuff. I think he probably knows what's going on. Yeah. So? So, do you know who the drug dealer at the party was last night? - Are you guys cops? - Ah, fuck. Are you kidding me right now? No! We're not cops. Why would we be fucking cops? Okay, fine. Fine. I know the guy. Great. Do you think you could take us to him? Please? Buckle up. Shit! Nice car. Should we take mine? Guys. Hey! Hey! Hey. Hey, yourself. I've been trying to find you. Here I am. Are you? Am I what? Are you here? Are you here? Oh. Now, you're just fucking with me. Yeah. Maybe a little, but this is where you left me. So, this is where you'll find me. Your friend Natalie is really worried about you. She's a good friend. We're trying to help her find you. That's really sweet. So, we're on, we're on drugs right now, right? Why? Does none of this seem real to you? No. That's fair. I mean, the stars've never looked like this. The stars have always looked like this. You just don't always see them. I've looked at stars before. They never looked like this. Everything you see is real. Well, considering what I've seen today, that might be the most terrifying thing I've ever heard. Yeah, well... today's your big day. Why'd you say that? What'd I say? What time is it? It's almost 8:00. That's, that's, that's 16 hours now. What's 16 hours? Since I took that stuff. I should be coming down. I should have come down seven hours ago. You're still tripping? Just stop. Stop right here. This is Richie's place. Now, listen. This guy is not somebody you wanna fuck around with so if you're still tripping or whatever, you gotta pull your shit together before we talk to him. He's got zero tolerance for junkies visiting his place. - Hey... - Can you keep this under control? I'm not some junkie, okay? I've got this. I'm fine. It's under control, all right? - Okay, bud. - Are you okay? Stop. I'm fine. - Just calm down. - I'm fine. - Calm down. - Fine. May not be home, but I'm thinking he might be laying low tonight. He worked the party yesterday so... He must be really tuckered out after spending all my money. What are you doing? Nothing. Sorry. Just come on. Jesus, I'm fucked. - Fucking calm down. - I'm fine. Here he comes. Who is it? It's Natalie. Who are those other fucking guys? They're, they're friends. - They're okay. - Hey. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. We're looking for my friend, Theresa. Shit. - Why, why shit? - I shouldn't have. All right. You know what? Let me handle this, y'all. No, no. She's gonna talk. Shut up. I got this. Watch this. Hey. Hello? Oh shit. You guys cops? No. Fuck, no! Absolutely not. Are you Richie? No, I'm Lamont. All right. That's Lamont. Lamont, is Richie here? Maybe he is, maybe he isn't. Jesus Christ, Lamont. If he's here, just... I already heard him yelling inside. We know he's here. Can I just- I just need to talk to him real quick. Fine, bitches! You want Richie? You fucking got him. That's not the guy either, fuck! Hey, fuck you! You're not the guy. - I didn't mean any disrespect. Are you sure? - I didn't mean any offense. - Okay. All right. Okay. Calm down. Okay. So, Mr. Richie, last night at the party, was anybody else workin' it? Excuse me? The party that we were both at. Remember? You, you, you sold me a gram. Coke. Snap, bitch! That was last night. Yeah. Fuck yeah, I remember you. Yeah. What's up, buddy? You was hanging out with my home girl, Natalie. Well, surprise. Oh! Snap again, bitch! What's up, Natalie? Hey, Richie. Oh, fuck. See, now I remember. I don't remember this pasty white bitch right here. Certainly not our usual clientele. We're looking for my friend, Theresa. Have you seen her? Can I see that for a second? I have not seen that bitch. And to answer your question, no, there was not. And there better not have been anybody else working that party last night. You dig? Okay. Absolutely. It's just that somebody gave my friend something. If you could be of any help, that would be... okay. Shit! Wow! You're on some good shit, right? Let me tell you what, buddy. Won't you come on in? We can give you somethin' to take that edge off. It's quite all right. We're good. We're good. - Come on, let's go. - Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Yeah, yeah. I'll meet up with you. - Listen. - Yep. Guys, you know, I'll catch up with you. - Are you fucking kidding me? - Yeah, I'm fine. Walk. I got it. I'll be fine. I'll take it. It's all right. Can you help me, please? What do you have? Please? - Come on in. - Yes. Now, if you wanna use one drug to come down off another drug, that is entirely possible. You just gotta tell me what drug you've already done. What? Now? Yes. It was like on a dropper with like a devil spoon. It tasted gross. I mean, just... Yeah, but that doesn't help me. So, okay. So, oh, and then I had to kiss. So it was about tongues. So I had to kiss another person who had it and that's how you pass it along kinda like... Look, I wanna help you... But you gotta give me something. Was it a stimulant, barbiturate, opiate, what? I don't know. Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down, sometimes I'm fast, sometimes I'm slow. I see things. I travel through time. Is that a thing? Have you heard about that? Shhh. Why don't we just go down the list? - Mhmm. Okay. 'Cause I'll gladly give you a fucking Percocet or an Ativan if all you wanna do is take the edge off. Shit. My sister still does spray paint from a brown paper bag. Now, she drools a little bit and I think she might be retarded, but fuck it. There's no judgment. That's just how she gets down. My cousin is mentally challenged. Point is, people come to me when they're serious about their drugs 'cause I'm the motherfucker who knows. - You dig? - Mh-mm. Good. Now, I got all your assortment of pills. I got your Ecstasy, I got your Molly, I got your Reds, I got your Barbis. I got all your Oxys, and I got all your Contins. Also, I got your standard cannabis edibles. Now, I have to tell you that I prefer these to smoking. Smoking is fucking disgusting. It makes you cough, you get the phlegm, it gets in your clothes, it's fucking repulsive. Now, some people maintain that with edibles, you can't control your dose. To those people, I say, "Go fuck yourself," right? You wanna control your dose, you gotta try heroin. Now, here's a drug that you have to control your dose. What a fucking dose it is. It's perfect. It's like you're enveloped in this nice, big, fat pussy. I like pussy. Some people can't handle violent style. They gotta come down. Hospitals offer Methadone. Me? I like to go straight to the root. The one, the only... Meth! No, seriously, Meth does get a bad rep. Not completely unwarranted; certainly not for the faint of heart. That's why me, myself, I prefer the OGK... motherfucking cocaine. I have to tell you, my shit ain't cheap. In fact, it's kind of expensive. But if you got yourself all twisted and you wanna straighten out, there's really nothing else for it. Point is, buddy, there's about a hundred different ways to skin this bitch. All men are different. Lamont, the scale. The scale; it's right there. What the fuck! Oh, you're gonna die. Whoo-hoo! Hey there, little rascal. Where'd you come from? Bye! There you are. We're still looking for you. I told you where you could find me. Ah, but I wanna find you for real. I'm right here. You know what I mean. Do I? Yes. You know, like the other night. In real life. Oh, the other night. That was real life? Did I find the real you? I'd like to think so. You were talking about people and their foolish TVs, knowing full well you have one you can't afford sitting in your living room, as we speak. See? The fact that you know that tells me you're not real. Well, I guess we have that in common. No, that's not right. I, I mean, yeah, I said those things, but not because I didn't believe them. Then why? I... I guess because that's the guy I thought you wanted me to be. Why? Why? Uh... Because that, that's the guy I wish I was. Tell me more about this guy. Well, he's a good guy. He's a good guy. He, he makes mistakes sometimes, but uh... he always tries to make it right. He just doesn't always know how, you know? Well, what kind of mistakes? Oh, that's what this is about? You... you think I fucked over that family. Your words. I was just doing my job. I don't, I don't deserve to be punished. The universe doesn't punish. Sometimes it just steers you through some hardships because in the end, it only wants one thing. And what's that? Harmony. If you pay attention, what appears chaotic is just the universe righting itself. It'll help you find your way. That, that's what that guy said. Uh... Aeolus, he said I would find my way. Is that why you took his drug? I don't know. I think so. Why the fuck would you take his drugs? Huh? What? What did I do? What did you do? You stole from a fucking drug dealer! - You fucking idiot! - I didn't steal anything. Fuck! Give me back my drugs, motherfucker! Jesus Christ! Frank, you took his fucking drug! What the fuck is wrong with you? I didn't mean to. The guy was offering them to me. Did you pay him for it? I don't have a wallet. You just killed us, you piece of shit! Pull the plug. Fuck! Hey, we're sorry. We're gonna pay you for your drugs. Hey, fuck you! - Jesus Christ! - Okay. Okay. - Jesus! - Okay. Okay. - What are you doing? - Fuck! All right. Look. Okay, just gimme a second to explain this, please. Please don't pull the trigger. Mr. Richie, I can see that my friend has upset you, and in his drug-induced state, it is quite possible that he accidentally forgot to pay you for some narcotics he intended to purchase. I want you to understand that none of us in this vehicle were aware of this transgression; my friend included. He's having a really fucked up day due to some substance that we have yet to identify. More importantly, we are completely prepared to reimburse you for any drugs my friend may have inadvertently forgotten to pay you for. Wow! Thank God. I mean, I guess we just got our wires crossed. See, we were under the impression that we were gonna have to kill you three motherfuckers. - No, no. - No, not at all. There's no need to kill any of us motherfuckers. As a, as a matter of fact, I know that time is money, money is time, and I wanna reimburse you for your time. And also, you let off a few shots. You let off about two. - Two? Two? Two, two... - At least. We'll round it off to three, four; four bullets. Bullets ain't cheap, and I'm... I wanna reimburse you for that as well. So why don't you just tell me how much to make this all go away. 2,37,465 dollars. Give or take. So... okay. So, after he swipes the drugs, I'm thinking to myself, I might actually have to kill this motherfucker 'cause he's either on the verge of a psychotic break or he's about to fucking rob me. So, I go to get my piece just so I can teach this fucking fool a lesson. And as I turn back around, he's fucking gone, along with all my fucking inventory. Please. Please. Wait. Wait. I don't know how this little fucker got away from me, but I guarantee it won't happen again. I really can't promise that. Okay. Frank? Buddy, where are my drugs? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't know. I really don't. Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. Listen. I know you don't have the money to make this go away, okay? But since you are the person that brought these two motherfuckers here to begin with, I do hold you accountable. Okay? You're gonna be the first to go. Wait, wait, wait. Wait! Hello! Hey! I'll get you your money. Really? So, you sold the drugs already, did you? Believe me, I have no idea where the drugs are. Fuck this. But, but I can get the money. Please don't hurt her. Call my wife. Her parents are loaded. They're, they're Wall Street investors. They have, they've tons of money. They have plenty of money and, and, and my wife, she'll be happy to bring the money here for our release. Your release? Motherfucker, I'm not holding you hostage! I caught you robbing from me. Be clear about that! I'm the victim! Absolutely! Absolutely. Of course. And, and, and for that, you are owed restitution. If you just give me my phone. Hey, hey! Give me my phone, and I will make that happen. I swear to God. Lamont dials. Understood? I don't want there being any funny business and have you accidentally calling 911 or something. I swear to you. What's your pass code? 6... 6969. What are you? 12? That was my meal card number in college. I swear. - Okay. - What's your wife's name? Are you in my contacts? Yes, motherfucker, I'm in your... I know how to work a fucking phone! I'm sorry. Sorry. Her name's Cheryl. It's ringing. No funny business. My word. What the fuck do you want, Frank? Cheryl! Thank God! Cheryl... I can't even believe you would call me... - Honey, please stop yelling. ...right now. - How do you even have...? - Honey, please stop yelling. I need you need to stop yelling. You have any idea... Yes, I know. I understand how late it is. You are such a fucking asshole! I need you to do me a big favor. - You're such an asshole. - Please listen to me. - I'm not even gonna... - This could be life or death. - This marriage is done! - Okay, scratch that. This is very much life and death! We haven't had sex, Frank. We don't even have sex anymore! Honey! Shut up! Listen to me. I need you to call your parents... I need you to ask them to borrow 240,000 dollars. Don't ask me what it's for. Just know that if I don't have it in a very short amount of time, some people are... You fucking idiot. Good luck! Honey? Cheryl? She hung up. I'm gonna call back. I'm gonna call her... Fuck this! Wait, wait! I'll call her back. I'll call her back! Wait, wait, wait! No! Frank, it's time. Richie? Hey! Richie! I'm here. I'm here. - Hey, glad you're here. - Okay. Okay. Hey, Frank! Oh, it looks like you've had a big day. What did you do to me? The fuck was that drug? You still think you're on drugs? Frankie, baby, you're delusional. Wait, what the fuck is happening? Is any of this real? Is this real? - Why are you doing this to me? - Relax, Frank. Oh, no. You're gonna make this right. Make what right? What does that mean? Harmony, baby. Harmony. Ah, fuck, har... fuck you, and fuck harmony. People are in real danger right now. No... Wait, I'm in it now. This isn't now. Right? I'll, I'll fix it. I'll just, Jeff and Natalie are here at the party now. I'll just warn them and I'll stop this fucking thing from happening now. Fuck. - Hey, Frank! - What? You think you're here now? Uh... more mumbo jumbo. What? Look at your face. Look how messed up it is. You can't change what has already happened. Frank, come here. You need to sit down. Sit the fuck down! Fuck. You're almost there. The universe is trying to tell you something. All you gotta do is pay attention. What the f... Is that your wallet? Of course. You're gonna need that. Okay. My friends are in real danger right now. I'm begging you. I need your help. Please? What do you think we've been doing all day? You have to learn to recognize when people are trying to help you, baby. Baby? - Baby. - Baby. - Baby. - Baby. People like you. People like you. So, what do I do? Tell me what to do. Please? Just listen. Listen to what? Listen to what? Hey, baby! Hey! That's your cue to fuck off. Good luck, Frank. Hey, baby. Hey, baby. Hey! Hey! What is your name? What happened to your face? I'll show you. This is my face, right? Okay, Wednesday. So it's tomorrow morning. I mean, I mean, yesterday. I mean, tomorrow from the party, but yesterday from today. So it's tomorrow for right now. Okay, I got it. Why am I here? Okay. Don't overthink this, Frank. What do I have? What is it showing me? What's already happened? Okay. Hey! You lost, baby? Need a hand? Sir! You remember me? Oh yeah. You were at the bar last night, right? - Yeah, I remember you. - Okay. Yes! Cigarette? No, but actually, do you have a minute? I might need some help. I'll make it worth your while. I promise. That is a really nice clock. Does that work? Yeah. Yeah. What the fuck is that? Where the fuck did you get that clock? Guys? Guys, listen. I can't even begin to explain it right now, but just trust me. Any second now, someone is gonna knock on that door and they're gonna make everything right. Shit. Oh, fuck this! Wait, wait, wait! You sneaky bitch. What the fuck is that? It's your money. Well, go see! Motherfucker! I never wanna see either of you assholes ever again. Wait, oh shit! Wait, Natalie! Hey, Natalie. Natalie, wait one second. Wait, hold on. Just one second. Hold on. Sorry, sorry. Listen, I am so sorry. I never meant to drag you into this, obviously, but I need you to do me a huge favor. Will you please, if you see Theresa before me, will you please tell her to call me? Please? Can you not even see what a disaster of a human being you are? You almost got us killed. I almost died. For what? So you could find your fucking wallet? You know you can call the bank and they can replace those cards, right? So why in the fucking Christ would you think for even a second, I would put my best friend in touch with someone like you? Hmm? But you didn't think, did you, Frank? 'Cause all you care about is what you want. Natalie? Theresa? Where the fuck have you been? Oh my God! I met a guy at the party. My phone died. I've been sleeping in my car like a homeless person. Fuck! Is that the guy from the bar? What happened to his face? I can't. Uhh.. get in. I will... So, I guess, I guess we can go. Do you mind dropping me at the office? Quick question. Where the fuck did you get the money? Umm... I took out a second mortgage on the home and I maxed out my credit cards, and I emptied all my accounts. While we were all tied up about to be killed, you filled out the paperwork for a second mortgage and received a check, cashed the check... Yeah. And had it delivered to the killers via bum? Yeah, a homeless man. - Homeless man. - But yeah, pretty much. How the fuck did you do that? I... I paid him ten grand. I paid him out of the bag. He's an honest guy, you know? Some people... The bum is an honest guy? - Homeless man. - The homeless man, sorry. - Yeah. - You're talking about the homeless man like he's the hard part of the equation to understand. Well, it's the only part I think I can explain. Fine. What'd you do with the drugs you stole? I have no idea. I honestly, I don't even remember taking them. Is this gonna happen all the time now? No. No. I, I don't think so. I, I figured it out. - All right. - It's over. I'm sorry. No. No. Just fucked up my car. - I got bullet holes... - I know. I will pay you. No, no, no, no, no. You don't have the money to fucking pay me right now. Right, that's true. All right. I'll take you back to the office. Thank you. Yeah. And I'm going to a bar and I'm gonna drink until this all starts to make sense. I'd invite you, but I have a feeling you need to sort out some things yourself. I need you to sort this out. I really do. I need you to explain this to me. I need that too. Wait! What do you want! Your signature. And an update for your insurance policy. What? What is this? Every three years, all employees must review their insurance paperwork and update their beneficiaries. This is your six-year anniversary. Congratulations. You now qualify for the Platinum Health and Life Insurance Plan. Platinum what? It's the premium insurance package for all long-term employees. It has a lower deductible, wider HMO coverage and a four-million-dollar life insurance plan for your family. It's exclusive for executives. Isn't that nice? What do I need to do? Just fill out the bottom part with the name of your spouse, your child, your parents, or whoever else it is that you think deserves the money. So, my wife? Sure. That's great. Hey, Helen? Helen? Oh, Mr. Winters, I also have a message from your wife. Do you mind reading it? I got a crazy headache. I don't think it's very appropriate. Helen, please just... You are such a baby. "Frank, you twisted son of a bitch. "They told me at the bank what you did. "I hope you have fun spending that money on your new whore. "Daddy was right about you. "I'm flying back to live with my parents in New York. "I hope your dick rots off. "See you in court, you piece of shit. Cheryl." Well, that's, that's fair. You know, I've been married a long time and whenever I make a mistake, I find it helps just to acknowledge that I wanna make things right even if I don't know how. That's all it takes, huh? Well, you also have to do it. Right. Words can carry you only so far. Right. That's really nice. What's, what's the occasion? Is it your birthday? No, they're from Mr. Jonas. It's National Secretary Appreciation Day. He is such a good boss. I thought that was yesterday. No, it's today. No, no. 'Cause I saw a sign yesterday that said it was yesterday. It's probably a sign to remind you to do something nice for someone. It wasn't yesterday. It was today. It's tonight. This was in your box. It was left in the conference room. I don't have a pen. The universe provides. Okay. Did the mail go out today? Well, they just picked it up, but if you hurry, you just might make it. I know what I have to do now. Well, that must be a good feeling. Yeah. Oh, and Happy National Secretary's Thing. Well, we prefer administrative assistants. Sure. Mike. Oh, Frank! Jesus Christ, man! What happened to your face? I told you, Jonas. I was mugged. - What? - Yeah. Again? - Oh, something like that, yeah. - Got your new insurance policy? Oh no, no. I'm not quite finished. I, I, I'm not done with it yet. This is the shit. But I need it to finish a little bit more. It... We need to have a serious conversation about this, Frank. I agree. Can we have that... You listen to me, you little cocksucker. I don't know what you're planning here, Frank, but I want you to know if someone comes in here and tries to cash this policy, I will fucking fight them with every fiber of my being, every lawyer at my disposal. I will bribe judges, I will change laws. It will be a cold day in hell before this policy pays out a single fucking dollar. Mr. Jonas. You know, Frank, I know it's been a rough couple days for you. It looks like it's been stressful. I'm gonna give you a chance. You can tear that policy up, show back up here for work tomorrow morning. Or you can sign it, affecting absolutely nothing, and I expect your resignation on my desk. Dick! I thought it would be harder. Doing the right thing always seems difficult. But when it comes time to make it happen, it's easy, it's natural. The universe knows what it wants. It wants balance. Fighting that balance will just throw your life into chaos. But once you let go, you let go of what you think you want. What you think you need. And that's when everything becomes so clear. And even really hard stuff gets easy. Hang in there, buddy. I'm coming. You make choices your whole life. Who to marry, what to wear, what your career will be, what you'll eat for breakfast. Each one of those choices will contain their own box of consequences or rewards, but sometimes, sometimes your purpose doesn't always lie in your choices. Frank? Sometimes your purpose lies in the consequences of others. Today, I accept my role in the universe. I am the hammer of fate, and I will restore the balance. Frank! This is my big day. Fuck! - That's a twist. - Look out! Oh, hey. Oh, hey, yourself. I've been looking for you. Here I am. So, you figured it out finally. Yeah. It took you long enough. I have discovered that time is a far more relative concept than I thought. Took you long enough. God, those stars are unreal. It was like he was heading across the street to help with the accident, and... I guess to see if anyone was hurt. And Jonas came from out of nowhere. It was like he didn't see it coming. I'm sorry about your friend. Between you and me, we smell booze on this asshole when we got on the scene. We'll make sure he pays. No, he's got the system by the balls. With the system, he'll probably have to go to traffic school or some shit. Yeah, these things have a way of working themselves out. Remember, karma's a bitch.
