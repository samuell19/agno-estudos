Amassacre here in Hesjovallen, a hamlet of 20 people. The hearses are here. The number of victims is unknown. More than ten. Why are you in my parents' house? -I can't teII you. I'm a judge. I'm sworn to secrecy. So pIease taIk. Do you know VaIfriedson? He and Eva Steen are the survivors. He onIy kiIIed Andrens? These are my parents' private papers. OId Ietters from 1865. My dear cousin. I'm gIad there aren't any sIant eyes in HesjovaIIen. Let him go. I can heIp you get revenge. -FoIIow the money traiI. It seems there's a kind of hit Iist. There is no hit Iist. We have the probabIe kiIIer. And his confession. You have to be carefuI. -I need poIice protection. You have to wait. There's a seriaI kiIIer about. Stay where you are. THE MAN FROM BEIJING Part 2 How is she? Shock, smoke inhaIation, but not criticaI. We'II take herto the hospitaI. We found a charred body in the back room. The victim is Brigitta RosIin, 53. ProbabIe smoke poisoning, concussion, fracture of the right arm bruises and smaII cuts, from the broken gIass. Your bag. I thought you might need it. What happened? -The ground floor is burned-out. The cause is cIear. The ownerfeII asIeep smoking in bed. Dead? -Yes. And the Chinese man? The Chinese man who tried to kiII me with a sword? What sword? We haven't found a sword. -I'm not imagining this. VaIfriedson confessed. -And where's the weapon? We'II find it. Sture secretIy watched and fiImed his guests. Footage of the Chinese man is on this. The night of the massacre, he stayed at Sture's HoteI. Afew weeks ago, an entire famiIy of Andrens was butchered in Reno. Sheriff Rogerson caIIed me. VaIfriedson can't have done it in Reno. Of course not. Do me a favor, and maiI this footage to Reno. And it was the Chinese man. With a sword. StockhoIm Airport How are you? Better. What was the message about? I'm terribIy afraid foryou. The man who murdered my parents tried to kiII me. I'm the Iast Andren. It's aII been too much foryou. -You don't want to understand. I finaIIy know what he Iooks Iike. I want justice, I owe it to my parents. Sundberg. What? VaIfriedson's dead? Well, then. We're talking about a certain Wang Min Hao. That's the name he used here as weII. The man entered the States through San Francisco three days before the murder. He was fingerprinted and photographed there. Washington is investigating in Canton. The Chinese man Ieft an address at the US consuIate in Canton. The passport and visa were sent there. -The name couId be faIse. But our consuIate says the visa is reaI. The address in Canton must be right, orthe passport wouIdn't have arrived. Can you send me the address? Ijust did. With the photograph. Good luck. I heard it on the radio. VaIfriedson has retracted his confession. VaIfriedson sIit his wrists Iast night with a razor. Dead? Everyone beIieved he was the kiIIer. Everything pointed to him. His record, his motive, his confession. He probabIy concocted a story, because he wanted to be someone. He wanted to be noticed, even as a mass murderer. But he knew detaiIs onIy the kiIIer couId know. He aIways Iiked snooping around. He probabIy was just at the scene. About the Chinese man: Reno has started an internationaI investigation. This morning we heard that a Wang Min Hao Ieft the country from StockhoIm. He returned a rentaI car. With traces of bIood, and bandages. I sent the DNAto Reno, for comparison. We're going to coIIaborate with the Americans. How Iong do you think it wiII take? -In China? I can't just get on a pIane to Canton. No, you can't. Here, this is foryou. -Thanks. Do you need a taxi? I can heIp you. Wait. I came here thirty years ago, and stayed. I worked at the archives of the HistoricaI Museum. If you Iike, I can give you a tour. You won't find a better guide. The museum. My card. -AfeIIow countryman. My name is Lund. I'm a SinoIogy professor. Which hoteI are you staying at? -The Wu Fang HoteI. Ask for a card with their name in Chinese characters. Oryou'II neverfind it again. This way, pIease. WeIcome to our hoteI. -My name's RosIin, I have a reservation. This way, pIease. ''My working conditions have worsened again. "God Almighty has sent grave diseases to our camp, to test us. "Every delay plays into the hands of the competitors. "Amerciless race against time." Get up. We don't have aII day. Here's another one who thinks he can avoid work. "Every day, l have to force those lazy Chinese vermin to work." ''This deviI became the nightmare of my ancestors, and their doom. ''Back then, when the raiIroad was buiIt. ''In the United States of America.'' PIease, Iet me take over my brother's work. I beg you. No way, everyone works today. HeIp him, you can carry his part as weII. Keep working. Take him away. My brother... One day, you'II push me so far I'II kiII you. "Jan Andren dishonored and tormented my father." ''Jan Andren kiIIed my father's brother, Qui San. ''This infamy must be revenged ''by you, who wiII come after me.'' Up there, that office buiIding. Here he comes, here he comes. That man. She's found us. Try to get a fix on a Swedish mobiIe number. Remember herface. And bring her here. Staffan Roslin's voicemail. Pass it on. -Toward Taikang. Can anyone here understand me? Vivi Sundberg. Brigitta here. I've found him. The man who kiIIed my parents. I've found him in Canton. CaII the embassy now. Try to get in touch with the consuIate. Is this your bag? Can I heIp you? Don't you need heIp? -You know where the nearest subway is? I'd better drive you overthere, okay? The subway. Can you Iet me out? -Yes, I know. It's more convenient if I take you directIy to the hoteI. Don't worry. Stay where you are. For my father, the time of slavery would finally come to an end. Five years. How time flies. That's how Iong we've known each other. You shouId be gIad. You can go back to your whore and your bastard. And now give thanks to Our Lord. Our Father in heaven. I have a right to pray how I want. -SIant eyes don't have any rights. Come on, pray. Our Father, who art in heaven. HaIIowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy wiII be done. On earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daiIy bread, and forgive us ourtrespasses. As we forgive those who trespass against us. And Iead us not into temptation. Forthine is the kingdom and the power and the gIory for ever and ever. It won't be Iong now. We'II see Daddy today. Overthere, by the mountains. For ever and ever. What are you staring at? Get to work. HeIp me. I have to get out of here. We've aImost made it. The Swedish embassy, pIease. -One moment. This is the Swedish embassy. Our opening hours are Monday... This is Brigitta Roslin. Can you heIp me report something to the poIice? What happened? -I've been mugged. That's terribIe. But... I'm afraid it's not so simpIe here. Reporting something to the poIice is compIicated. But there is one police station that can deal with foreigners. They speak EngIish. It's nearyou, the hoteI knows the address. But please call any time you want to visit the museum. I'm Iooking forward to it. -Yes. Thank you, Professor Lund. I've been robbed. AII my papers are gone, so is my money. The embassy is in Peking, how do I get there? And... Tomorrow. Come back tomorrow. Where are you? What are you doing? I've found him. I saw him this afternoon. Who did you see? -The kiIIer. But then they mugged me. -Did they hurt you? To kidnap me. -Are you hurt? Just my arm. I had to break the window. Oh, Staffan, you were right. It's too much. I need you. The Swedish... Are you stiII there? Room service. -Put it by the door. Reception? I was making a Iong distance caII to Sweden. I was cut off. Can you reconnect me? Of course. l'll call you back in a moment. Come to the phone in the lobby. We can connect you there. Can't you do it in my room? Sorry, there's a technical problem... -AIright, I'm coming. What? The connection is bad. -Did you hear what I said? Yes, you broke a window. -I won't Iet the brute get me down. PIease come home. I'II book a flight. -I can't. They've got my passport. -Can't I do anything foryou? Ijust wanted to hearyour voice. Thanks. Take care of yourseIf. Mrs. RosIin? I wouIdn't disturb you at night if it wasn't very important. The poIice have found this. Your bag. My name is Qui Hong. I'm partIy responsibIe for security in the city. We're proud, by the way, that the crime rate in China is very Iow. If anything does happen, we'II handIe it. -I was mugged. I'm very sorry you weren't abIe to report it to the poIice before. The bureaucracy. But we'II make up for it. You're a judge. In China, judges are highIy respected. May I come in? -Do you have an ID? Yes, of course. But you probabIy can't read it. Is anything missing? Nothing, except money. PIease check again. Nothing's missing, except the money. Do you know that man? Who is he? How did you Iose your bag? -I was mugged. Did he have anything to do with it? -You teII me. Do you know him? AII hoteIs have to report their guests. Contact me if there's any troubIe. We'II teII you where and when you can report the crime. And pIease switch off your ceII phone. Buy a prepaid card or use a Iand Iine, so you can't be traced. We don't want any more unpIeasantness foryou. May I? You're staying aII night. You'II be reIieved at six. Do you treat aII robbery victims this way? I can send them away, if you Iike. No, thank you. What about the picture? -We need it, as evidence. Your suspicions were confirmed. We couId identify the person in this picture. He's caIIed Dong Liu. He's appIied for visas to Sweden and the US. He's head of security at Ya Yu Ya. If it's true what that woman says, it has high priority forthe party. Isn't it your personaI priority as weII? She's coming. Here's your prepaid card. I see her. Mrs. RosIin? You're expected. Why did you take this Iong journey, from Sweden to China? I'd Iike to heIp you. I'm afraid you have no choice but to trust me. You want to heIp me? Find out who that man is. I saw him here yesterday. He kiIIed aII my reIatives. Find out why a Chinese man has systematicaIIy murdered 23 members of a Swedish famiIy, on two continents. Those are outrageous charges. But I'II Iook into them. This is Dong Liu, your head of security. ASwedish judge wants him for a massacre. She got this photo from a hoteI nearthe scene. She tracked him down here, in front of your office buiIding. You've aIways been just a hanger-on. And you've done nothing. Nothing. To heIp remove this oId dishonor from ourfamiIy. PIease excuse me. PIease foIIow me. There are indications that the man you're Iooking for may be invoIved in the crimes. I saw the kiIIer in front of this buiIding. He may be working forthis man. I want to stress again that I'II personaIIy handIe this case tiII it's fuIIy soIved. In the meantime, Mrs. Huey Ru is responsibIe foryour safety. As Iong as this isn't soIved, you may be in danger. It wouId be shamefuI if we weren't abIe to protect an important guest Iike you. I'd Iike to go home as soon as I've made my statement. The suspect is in town, it shouId be possibIe to catch him. We aIready have important Ieads. But we need to investigate further, and you're our main witness. With my statement, I'II be signing his death sentence? Just punishment for someone who's kiIIed 23 peopIe. Your judiciaI system aIarms me. -Your standards don't appIy here. I don't understand you either. This man kiIIed your parents. You chase him around the worId, then you don't want to see him punished? The death penaIty doesn't make amends. It's revenge, not punishment. -You ask for our heIp and Iecture us on our moraIity? Don't forget we don't criticize your Iax treatment of criminaIs either. Can I come in? Ijust wanted to see if you were aIive. But now I have to go down to get a room. -Don't. What do you mean? -Don't you dare. ''Chinese women are aII whores, who seII themseIves for IittIe money. ''AIthough God teaches us that prostitution is a grave sin. ''But the Chinese don't care.'' lt has even come to pass that a Chinese whore offered herself to me in my own camp. Where is my husband? His name is San. ''But I punished herterribIy forthis.'' Where is my husband? My IittIe sIant-eyed dove. Come aIong, come aIong. God was testing me with this temptation. San, what happened? What happened? But l resisted. You Iocked him up? San is a free man today. I decide when he can go. Get it? I'm the man you have to ask, if you want to go. When you're a damn sIant eye. And I'm teIIing you perhaps he can go tomorrow. But first, we ceIebrate. Come on, ceIebrate. CeIebrate. Come on, go and ceIebrate. Let's ceIebrate. CeIebrate. You're ceIebrating with me. No. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. -Get in there, you. That night, my mother died at the hands ofJan Andren. I have to go. -Wait, I'II go with you. No, you can sIeep Iate. -I'II go with you. I've written everything down foryou. Does bIood vengeance exist in China? BIood vengeance? No. In the European sense, it doesn't exist in China. Why? I found oId Ietters that say Chinese aIso worked on the American raiIroads. I can't heIp feeIing something dreadfuI happened back then. We can go to the archives Iater. They must have materiaI on it. Why did you become a judge? To improve the worId. But good and eviI, right and wrong, they're so cIose together. I'II never get it. EspeciaIIy here. -Because the Western view is based on fear, prejudice and cIiches. But it's possibIe to understand China. China has survived the emperor, Mao and the CuIturaI RevoIution. It'II aIso survive unbridIed capitaIism. When I think about the Swedish students who thought Mao was God... Didn't you? Mao was the aIternative to the bourgeoisie. To our parents. Here, peopIe have an unshakeabIe beIief in a capitaIist future. The same way they beIieved in Mao Zedong. But inside, the Chinese are stiII so stabIe and so diIigent because the famiIy is stiII the most sacred thing. It provides survivaI and continuity, no matter what poIiticians do. FamiIy is the most sacred thing to the Chinese? AbsoIuteIy. Can we go to the archives? -Yes, pIease. l'm writing the history of my parents. For you, my descendants. Because of these terrible events, ourfamily can never be united again. Only vengeance can unite us. Many Chinese were shanghaied and brutaIIy taken to the USA. To work as cheap forced Iaborers there. Forthree to five years, they had to work off the cost of theirforced journey. Thousands of them were kiIIed. EspeciaIIy in 1863. Amurderous competition broke out between two raiIroad companies. The one who reached the Pacific first made miIIions, the other one went bust. The Chinese are stiII traumatized. AIso by the coIonization by the British, French and Germans. What's that? Astrip of siIk. It was usuaIIy red. AIso the coIor of marriage. In some areas, a strip of red siIk is stiII a promise of marriage. And when it's cut up? Then the coupIe was separated. They each took haIf. As a promise to neverforget each other. That night, my mother died at the hands ofJan Andren. Pain and darkness surrounded us. From then on, retribution dominated my thoughts. Those were crueI, inhuman times. These Chinese were executed for aIIeged theft. And these men were acquitted even though they aII kiIIed severaI Chinese forced Iaborers. Can you teII me something about this company? You'd better not do business with them. If that's why you came to Canton. They don't have a good reputation. Does the name Ya Ru mean anything to you? It seems a stockbroker who worked with this man was recentIy executed. There's nothing about it in the paper. He's head of Ya Yu Ya. That's not a Chinese character, by the way. Then what can it mean? -One moment. Who's that? -Arich merchant from San Francisco. At the time, it was fashionabIe to adopt a mon, a famiIy embIem, Iike in Japan. There's no name given. OnIy that he was second-generation, a textiIe merchant and that his parents were kiIIed by the raiIroad. ApparentIy, this burdoned him very much. Only vengeance can unite us. From then on, retribution dominated my thoughts. If the merchant witnessed his mother's death, as a chiId... and passed on the caII to vengeance to his chiIdren, and their chiIdren... That couId be the motive forthe massacre. If Ya Ru is a descendant of the merchant, that couId be the motive. But then the question remains, how Iong wiII this hate continue? ''It's the dead of night when my dear fatherfinaIIy regains consciousness.'' ''He's badIy wounded, and confused.'' I have to get this thing off. It's driving me crazy. Then we'II Iook for a doctor. They're coming. Here it is. You'II see, it heIps. Even if you don't beIieve in it. We don't use pIaster so much anymore, in these cases. Not as much as in Europe. Go easy on your arm for a whiIe. And have a good trip. Is that better? -Much better. They took off. -I'II caII Hong. What's up? -She's not answering. I'II send her a text message. It's certain that this Andren murdered 300 of our peopIe. Three hundred. The dragon has onIy sIain 24 foreign deviIs. What's 24 against 300? CIeanse me of this fiIth, then your mission wiII be compIeted. You're a sick man. This revenge won't get rid of eviI. EviIjust breeds more eviI. I won't Iet us Iose face with the party and the pubIic. So I'II stop aII investigations into you. On the condition you stop aII your corrupt deaIs right away and retire from pubIic Iife, to chase the demons out of your souI. And there's anotherthing. I protect the judge and her husband. Never caII off my bodyguards again. Overthere. Taxis. What's the matter? That's him, Staffan. Everything's aIright. Come on, we have to hurry. Hurry, hurry. Get in. Go on. This hoteI beIongs to our department. -Which is? No one wiII find you here. -State Security, KGB? Mrs. Hong wiII be here soon. She'II answeryour questions. This is a brotheI. -How do you know what one Iooks Iike? Everyone has his dark side. But that's Ya Ru. Look at this. That's Ya Ru, and that's Hong. So Ya Ru is Hong's husband. No. Ya Ru is my brother. What does my wife's famiIy have to do with atrocities from 140 years ago? Why did that mass murderer try to kiII us an hour ago? Huey Ru just kiIIed a man to save your Iives. Accept that as proof that I'm on your side. It's such a disgrace. So your brother is the... the... -Psychopath. He sent Dong Liu to kiII you as weII. Professor Lund Ied him to us. I don't know anyone caIIed Lund. No. My brother bribed one of your bodyguards. One of my men. I get the impression that, as a judge, you insist on a pubIic soIution to this case. I won't cover anything up. I'II send my brotherto the executioner. I'II be expeIIed from the party. And my famiIy, that has served this country for so Iong, wiII Iose face. My famiIy and I have nothing to do with what happened in Nevada. And yet, my parents, and aII the others, had to pay for it gruesomeIy. What if I ask you to Ieave the motive and background out of your statement? And say that Dong Liu's execution cIosed the case? Because, regarded objectiveIy, he is the mass murderer. No. I promise you you'II be safe, and that my brother wiII be punished. For other crimes. Didn't you say you were against the death penaIty? So we're aIIowed to Ieave the country now? What guarantee do I have that you won't go to the media in Sweden? None. Then how can I Iet you go? How can you not Iet us go? I'II give you time to think about it. In the meantime, you're my protected guests. Protected guests. The death of a great master of ourtradition overshadows my souI. I have aII the evidence I need against you. I'II traveI with my son, and teach him. -Ya Ru, you don't have a son. I'II retire, Iike you asked. But what about the judge and her husband? Who'II put the red strip together again? I Iove you. You know you have to kiII the judge and her husband. Why are you so weak? I've given orders to have you picked up. You want to have me executed, Iike Shen Wixan? I'm your sister. You urgentIy need to enter a cIinic. I trust you. Just as much as you trust me. Our bodyguards are Ieaving. Let's get out of here. I've got the tickets. WeIcome aboard. WouId you Iike a toweI? And foryou. -Thank you. Mrs. RosIin, you have to come with us. -No, my wife's staying. PIease come aIong. My wife's staying here. Don't touch her. Don't make troubIe. Sit down. Easy. I want to taIk to the captain. Sorry. UntiI we're in the air, we have to obey the poIice. Then I'II ask my embassy if you have the right to take her. Stay in your seat. Describe the woman who shot the man. The one you cIaim attacked you on the bridge. That is the onIy crime we're investigating. Ask Mrs. Hong. She introduced herseIf as a security officiaI of the city. We were heId at a hoteI, aIthough you don't seem interested. UnfortunateIy, Mrs. Hong was the victim of an accident Iast night. She's dead. Can I go to the bathroom? But your ceII phone stays here. Here. This way. AIright. I'II be finished in an hour. At Iast, Mrs. RosIin. I've waited forthis a Iong time. What do they have to do with it? What do they have to do with it? Why? You wouId have simpIy shot me. Forgiveness is aIien to you. As aIien as to your ancestor, Jan Andren. And as aIien to me. Forgiveness is possibIe. I was just a chiId when I had to watch my father's souI being shattered. He'd Ioved my mother so much. Just as I couId neverfind peace, nor my chiIdren nor my chiIdren's chiIdren... so our enemies wiII find no forgiveness. And I pray my famiIy wiII one day produce a truIy strong man to take revenge on the Andrens. MerciIess revenge. UntiI there's no Andren Ieft. With the sword, you wiII destroy those who destroyed us. l'll die too soon. Because l wasn't able to restore my family's honor. I've done what I couId, but it wasn't enough. I'm no better than he was. I wanted him to die.
