Stop retiring. Oh dear god! - Did you see the dress Amy was wearing in church? What happened to you? - Let her be. You wanna tell me what happened? What's the matter child, can't you tell me? - Today, brothers and sisters, we look to Genesis, the first book of the holy bible to speak to us not of history and things of the past, but of what will happen if we turn deaf ears to the word of God. In Genesis Chapter 19, we read of two angels who come to the city of Sodom to visit Lot. They abhor the wickedness of the people therein. The children have fled from their parents to frolic in wickedness and to do evil deeds. To rob, to rape, and to live in sin with one another. They painted themselves and they loved money and music and frivolity, more than they loved holiness. So the angels said to him, we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxen great. From the Lord out of heaven, and he overthrew these cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the grounds. - I'll take care of you later. (country music from radio) - God does not fool around, my friends. (bell tolling) - Hey sister. Hi there. - Preacher. - How's auntie? I will. Brother, good to see you always. (crowd chattering) - Let's get him. - Thank you mam, thank you. Sister, good to see you. - We'll be home soon, Ma. - [Ma] Don't y'all be late now. Dinner's at 10:30. (car starting) (revving) (tires screeching) - [Man] Move, come on. - [Man] I'm going as fast as I can go. (shouting over each other) (shouting over each other) (car honking) (crashing) (shouting over each other) - Stay away from me, you fuckers, stay away! - Go on, dammit!

(light music) - It's a girl. - Can you give me a lift? - What are you doing out here this time of night, honey? - I'm going to Nashville. - We're heading for Murphy's burrough. - Well, that's close to Nashville. - Are you running away from home? - My parents know all about it. - How old are you? - I'm 19. - Sure, and I'm 120. Look, I'm not about to get myself into trouble over no runaway girl. - I live more than 60 miles from here. You want me to walk all the way back in the middle of the night? - Come on, Burt. - All right. - No way, come on. (zooming) - So, what's in Nashville? - Didn't you see the guitar? She's gonna be the next Tanya Tucker, ain't she? - I don't know about that but I found an ad that says these people can help me get my songs published. No! - Knock it off George, she's only a kid. - I changed my mind. You gotta let me out! Let me out! (car honking) - He won't try it again. (zooming) It's gonna be a long night. How about some ham and eggs? - I don't like what I see. - Oh you ain't seen nothing yet. It's just a couple truck drivers and that girl walking in the cafe. - Want a menu? - Give me three eggs over easy, hash brown potatoes and coffee. Skip the toast. - Hotcakes and sausage for me. - Coffee? - Yeah. - What about her? - My fiancee will have a milkshake. - Gee, I hope they'll excuse her from kindergarten for the wedding. - Now Ofert, I'ma tell you again. If they're just sitting there, there ain't nothing we can do about it. - Something tells me they're gonna do more than just sit there. - I know it ain't easy. But Brenda Lee started singing when she was four and recording when she was only nine. - Yeah and look how long it took her to get where she is today. - And what about Tammy Wynette and Loretta Lynn, and Dolly Parton? You know she's got a sister Stella who ain't doing so bad. - You think you can just walk into a recording company and say here I am, my name is Jamie, please publish my songs, give me a recording contract? It don't work that way. - I didn't say that. But look. See what this says? This Mr. Ordell can help me. - These ads are a lot of crap. Pass the ketchup. - Jesus, it's three o'clock. I'm bushed. - Yeah, why don't we shack up for a while? We can go on when it's light. - [Burt] Well even if we can get a room, what are we gonna do with her? - Oh I can hitch a ride with someone else or I can just stay in the restaurant. - They won't let you do that. - Then I can stay in the truck. - Hey, why couldn't she sleep in the room with us? On the floor. - I suppose she could. And nobody gonna bother you. - Okay, I guess. - Okay, we're all set, come on. - [Cop] Hot damn. - [Cop] I told you that. - [Cop] Damn we go. - Now? - Let's go. - You owe me five bucks. (crashing) Go freeze, assholes. - What the fuck? - What the hell's going on? - You stay where you are. - You heard what this man said, don't nobody move. (chuckling) - Hey, what's your name? Come on, come on, come on up. Come on here. Come on out where we see. Are we having a little party, are we, huh? - I'm gonna ask you one more time. What's this all about? - Now son, she don't look 18 to me. Now do you know what that means? - And you, you son of a bitch, you know what it means to bust in here without a warrant then. And molest my daughter! - Your daughter? - Who the hell do you expect to be sleeping in a bathtub, my goddamn girlfriend? Now get your ass out of here before I file charges! - Let's go, come on. Come on, let's go. Come on, come on, come on. - Sorry mister. I hope we don't get into trouble. - Oh shut up! - You think you're gonna get away with it? - Well I sure as hell ain't gonna wait to find out. Come on, let's move it. (fast paced country music) Music City USA, here we come. Listen kid, I don't wanna get stuck in the middle of town. But we'll take you to the outskirts of Nashville. - Thank you guys, you're beautiful! - Why couldn't you be a little bit older? (strumming) - [Man] Hop in, young lady. - You're Ray Hamilton! - The king of country Western. Six gold records, six million fans, that's me. Now you hop in here. Time's wasting. - Hey! What? Ow! Stop it, ow! No! Hey, come on. Stop! (tires screeching) You goddamn son of a bitch, I ain't ever buying your record again! (slamming) - It's not supposed to work this way. What do I keep doing wrong? - [Woman] Hey, whoever it is, I forgot my towel. Can you give me a towel please? - I only got the one I'm wearing. - So give me yours. - I can't go back to my room without anything on. - This is the YW, not the YM. What's your name? - Jamie. - Okay Jamie, do me a favor. Go back to room 207 and grab something. Grab anything and bring it back, okay? - Okay. - Tada! - Uh hey look, I'm sorry. I thought you were Al. - Who's Al? And who are you? - I'm Al, short for Alice. And this is my boyfriend Bill. - Hey. - He's been staying with me at least twice a week since I moved in. That's the only way he can get into this joint. - Excuse me. - Hey, don't go. Hey, why'd you come to Nashville? - To have my songs published. - Oh no. Not another one. - You too? - Sure, what would a girl from Brooklyn do over here if she didn't get into country western music? - How'd you make out? - Great. How does unemployment insurance grab you? - [Bill] Hey, have you met anybody yet, any guys? - I ain't interested in boyfriends. - You never fucked a guy? - I never slept with a guy. - I'll bet all she ever wanted was a guitar. - I just wish I still had one. (strumming) How much? - 49 dollars. - You're kidding. - I'll let you have it for 45. - Well how about five bucks down? - 15. - 10? - All right. It's a deal. But five dollars every week until you got it paid off. - How much is this one? - 945 dollars. If you're a good kid I'll let you have it for 900. I tell you what, come back in the year 2012, if you're still here, you can have it for nothing. - Smartass. - Thank you. - Now what? - Now we go for what I came here for in the first place. Well this is the place all right but it don't look like much. - Few places in Nashville do. All the big companies are here and 90 percent of them are places just like this. - Mm, oh, what do you want? - I read this ad and I wanna know what I have to do to have my song published. - Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought you was here for a job. Mr. Ordell's out of the office right now. He's at a recording session with one of our clients. Won't you girls sit down? - Thank you. - Oh, I'm Beauty, Mr. Ordell's secretary. (buzzing) Um, he should be here any minute. I'm sure he'll be glad to talk to you. - Any messages, Miss Jenkins? - Oh, Motown called. They liked the tapes you sent over. They want to discuss them with you tomorrow. Also, you had a call from MCA. They wanna know if you've got anything for Tanya Tucker. Oh and Columbia Records also called. - That's all for now. I'll take the rest of them later. (knocking) What is it? - Um, Mr. Ordell, there's a Miss Barker out here to see you. Can she come in? - [Ordell] I'm a very busy man. Ask her to come back tomorrow. - But Mr. Ordell, she came a long way to see you. She's been waiting outside forever. - Well, I can only give her five minutes, send her in. - Right this way, girls. - Well, howdy girls. Ordell's the name, C.Y. Ordell. My friends call me C.Y. Now my secretary informs me that you're a composer and looking for a little help to get your song published? Is that right, Miss Barker? - I'm Miss Barker, Jamie. - Of course. - She's already filled out the questionnaire. - Oh, thank you Beauty. - Now, a couple of things I like to caution you young ladies about. First of all, I'm gonna work very hard for you. But at the same time, I can't guarantee 100% that I'll be successful in getting your song published. But my track record is good. And of course there is a bit of investment required in a deal of this kind. - How much? - Well we'll get to that later. But to get to point number three. I only handle composers and singers that have real talent. Because it would be unfair to both them and me to take the time and the money it costs to get a thing like this started, you follow? - Oh I understand, yeah. - Now, did you bring your tapes? - Tapes? - Yes, of your songs. - I ain't got no tapes. But I brought my guitar. May I sing a song for you? - Why certainly. Why not? Go ahead.

Matter of fact, it's kind of good. I think the song needs a little polish but I think I can handle it. Now the first thing we have to do is make a demo. - What's a demo? - That's like an audition record that we play for the big record companies. Now if they like it, they may make the record and pay for it themselves. Otherwise, we may even cut it. - What do you mean by we? - Well I have to hire a producer. - A producer? - [Ordell] Well how else are we gonna get a band together? - What band? - The band to make your demo tapes. But don't worry about it. Now let me see, I think we'll need about eight pieces. A lead guitar, an electric guitar, 12 string guitar, bass piano, couple of fiddles, maybe a drum. - Well I can do my own playing. - She's good, really good. - Well maybe you got a point there. It'll be only one less guitar. Maybe we can save a little money that way. - How much? - How much what? - How much will it cost? - I don't know, I figure about five. - Five hundred? - Five thousand. - [Both] Five thousand dollars? - How else are we gonna hire a producer to hire a band to hire a recording studio to get to the music publishers, the record distributors, the disc jockeys. That all costs money. - [Al] Let's go. - But Al. - [Al] Let's get out of here. - Now, just a minute, let's not get excited. Let's just relax, huh? Give me a minute to think about it. Maybe I can figure some way to cut the costs a little more, like, - About how much? - Say, 3,000 dollars. Of course that means I get a little higher percentage of your earnings. - Mr. Ordell, could you do us a favor? - Well certainly, anything. - Shove the percentage up your ass. - Very very busy man. - Same to you, fella! - Well look on the positive side. You just saved yourself 3,000 bucks. - Yeah, well I ain't quitting. If I need money I'm gonna get some. - How? - I'm gonna get a job. - Haven't you heard there's a recession on now? - Where I come from there's always a recession on. (typewriter clacking) (light music) - Hey there's no work here. - Look honey, even if we had a job and there's nothing open right now, we couldn't hire you anyhow. You're too young. And we don't hire nobody under 18. - Thanks. - Anyway, that's why I'm leaving Nashville. Look, now I've at least got a job in Memphis. There's no point in me staying in Nashville. - I'm gonna miss you. It's gonna be really lonely without you. - Any luck with a job yet? - I've been to every crummy joint in town. There's nothing. - Have you got any money left? - Enough to last a few days. I'm going to see the producers and publishers myself. - What if nothing happens? - I just can't squeeze anybody else in today. No, look, I'm sorry. I've listened to 27 tapes today and I just don't have any more time. All right, call me next week, okay? Here you go. - Well, what'd you think? - I like it. It needs some more work. The instruments are drowning out the voices too much. - [Man] We can take care of that. - I thought you could. Okay, tell you what you do. Work up a new budget, get it back to me next week. I'll submit it to L.A. and if they can go for it we're in business. - Thanks Jake. - Okay. All right, who's next? - I am. - [Jake] I'm Jake Miller, what's your name? - Jamie Barker. - Well Jamie, did you bring your tape with you? - I ain't got no tape but I can play you a song. - Honey it wouldn't make any difference if I liked your songs or not. I don't have time for demos. Now you've got to find somebody to do one with you then bring it back and I'll listen to it. - But maybe-- - Look, kid, I wish I could help you. But there are a hundred kids who come to Nashville everyday just like you who are trying to be performers, trying to get their records published, and I just don't have time. Don't you have a family you can go back to? - Shit. - Yeah? - I read the ad. - Kind of wet behind the ears, ain't you? - I'm 20. - Sure, kid. I'll ring Fred. (dinging) - Yeah? - Girl says she read the ad and wants the job. She says she's 20. - She says she's 20, then she's 20. You wouldn't lie to us, would you? The job pays two bucks an hour. You come in at six in the evening and you work until two a.m. Any problems? - No, that's just fine for me. That would give me the day to make my rounds. - We don't allow no sidelines away from the premises. - I make my rounds to the publishing houses and record companies, and I, - Ooh, another one of those. Look kid, I just want you to be on time and be polite to the customers. And just one more thing. Do you have something a little more catchy to wear? Well maybe we can find something for you. - You got an appointment? - Jesus H. Christ. I'll take you honey, or you can take me. - Now look, buddy, I found this lady. - I am not a masseuse, I am a receptionist. (dinging) - You're back in town. - Hey, your favorite customer's back honey and I got an extra 20 for a real good time, you understand what I mean? - Are you gonna take care of me? - You bet your wife I will. - You could make a lot more money if you give a massage every once in a while. - I ain't interested. - Thanks Jamie. Two more payments and it's all yours. - How much did you say that one was? - It's still the same price. 945 dollars. - Someday. Thank you. - Here's your receipt for 15 dollars for a half hour massage. - How much for a half and half? - What's that? - You mean you haven't heard? It's when the girl massages me for a half hour and I massage her for a half hour. - What'll they think of next? - When will Meredith be through, and where's Laura? - Laura's sick. - I'm not gonna wait much longer. - Okay, you, take the next customer, I'll take your place. - No, I ain't, I'm the receptionist. - I'll give you five seconds to think it over and then you're fired. - No. - [Fred] Then you're fired. - Here, you keep it. - You don't understand. I need the money I already got in this guitar. - Look, I'll tell you what I do. You hold on to the guitar and I'll give you 20 dollars. In a few days, if you don't have a job, bring the guitar back and I'll give you the difference. - Okay. - If you wanna pick it up and play it, Jamie, go ahead. - Thanks, but no thanks.

(gavel hitting) I'm taking your age into account, Miss Barker. I'm sentencing you to three months to juvenile detention farm. (fly buzzing) - Why, you look like you've been doing it all your life. - I grew up on a farm. - What you in? - Prostitution and indecent exposure, but I was framed. - Yeah, so was I. Probably two guys have copied you, one in front, one in back. Haha pow pow wonder what you get changed. - How long you in for? - Five days, three hours and 12 minutes. - You're lucky. - [Woman] Hey you, Jamie, get over here! - Watch it, throw a string to that bitch and she'll try to make a pass at you. - What do you mean? - You can't be that innocent. - Come on, get your ass over here! What's that nigger bitch been telling you? - Nothing. - Come with me, I've got a surprise for you. - My guitar! Wow. Oh, how can I ever thank you? - There'll be a way. - What am I gonna do about Brenna? - What did you do about the guy who attacked you? - Yeah, but that was different. - [Frisky] No difference. - You know Frisky, I'm really glad for your sake that you're getting off tomorrow. - [Frisky] Yeah. - But every time I get to like someone they take off on me. - How much more time you got? - Five weeks. - Hey listen. When you get out, you wanna come stay at my pad? - Could I really? - Yeah. Hey and I can even introduce you to this guy who knows everybody in the music business in Nashville. - Oh, Frisky, you're beautiful. - Yeah, you ain't told me nothing I don't know. I said hurry up, lights out at nine. And if Lois catches you in there it's gonna be trouble. I'll be here at seven. - I can do that myself. - It's almost curfew time. You could get in trouble if I reported you. - Leave me alone, Lois. - I'm only trying to help. - Fuck off, Lois. - Ungrateful slut! (slapping) (slapping) (bashing) - Lois, this is not the first time you've accosted a girl, but it is the last. You are hereby relieved of your duties and you'll report to the board for disciplinary action. I said dismissed. (sighing) I'm sorry that happened. Jamie I've looked at your record, and frankly, I think you should never have been sent here. Well I know what you're thinking. It's my job so why don't I change things? Well believe me, I'm trying. It's just that it's going to take a little time. Meanwhile I'll do everything I can to get you paroled as soon as possible. (light music) (whistling) (laughing) - As Lois would say, get your ass over here! - Thank you! - For what? - For being here. - I said I would, didn't I? Hey remember that guy Kelly I was telling you about? - Uh huh? - Well he thinks he might be able to help. - That's wonderful. - Oh no, before you get excited and pee all over yourself. A word of warning. Now Kelly's a good musician and he's not such a bad guy but nobody does anything in this town for nothing. Well nobody I met anyway. - I'll take my chances. - [Frisky] You sure? - There are only two things I'm sure of. I can't go home again. And more than anything I wanna make it in this tiny town. - Well that what you just might have to. (revving) - Okay Kelly, that's what I want, seven minor. - You got it. But I sure don't get the value of the G chord. - Well okay, let's drop it one. Six minor. - A one four five. - But it starts on a nine, doesn't it? - Tell me what it is, Kelly. - Just your basic A, D, E. - Okay. Now on that next bar, hold the E bass. Okay now, give me a little bit of B. I'm sorry, A. Okay, that's it. Ready Johnny? - Yeah. - Okay everybody let's see if this thing plays. - I'm gonna introduce you to Mishmash just as soon as the session's over. - Thanks, Kelly.

Maybe if I went and explained to him what I want. - Forget it. When Mishmash is through, he's through. - Kelly, tell me what to do. I wanna get ahead so bad, I'll do anything. - You sure? - Yeah. - All right. Don't come around to me if things don't work out exactly the way you want them to. - Okay, you can go in now. - Hell, I was here first. If you ain't beautiful and female, you can't get a chance. ♪ Who knows you ♪ - I'm sorry, he's busy. - Guys, I promised Jamie here a demo session. Now we got just a couple of minutes.

That was really good. - Thank you. - Let me see what I can do with it, okay? - Okay. - I'll see you tonight. - You liked it? - Mhmm. - My music recording session today? The demo. - Mr. Mansby will see you now. - Come in. Kelly told me all about you. - Get your hands off me! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! - When's the last time you saw Kelly? - About a week ago. I was just another lay. - I hate to say it but I told you. - It ain't your fault. (knocking) (laughing) - [Frisky] Hey Kelly! - I've been looking all over for you. - Couldn't have been looking very hard. - Hey we're celebrating. - Yeah, what you celebrating? - Jamie's 17th birthday. That is the legal age of consent in this country. - Big deal. - Well happy birthday. I have to have something for you that happens to be a little headliner. Something really worth celebrating. - Like maybe a king size mattress? - Aha, will you get off my back? Can't you see the handwriting up there on the wall? Kelly plays your tape for Jeb Hubbard. - Jeb Hubbard? Did he like it? - He happens to think you're very talented and wants to see you in the morning. - Yeah, where? - He keeps a little place in town, his place. - [Frisky] Does he know how old she is? - Sure he does, who cares. He's got a weakness for young chicks. Let me look at you. You know you just might be too old already. - I don't care, I just wanna meet him. - You are tomorrow morning. - Oh god. (laughing) (knocking) - Oh Jesus I forgot. That must be Kelly. Come on, get in here. You be quiet. I'm gonna need this. Oh. (knocking) Yeah, yeah. - You said 10. - Yeah sure, come on in. - Jeb, this is the girl I told you about, Jamie. Jamie, this is Jeb Hubbard. - I know, I've been a fan of yours forever. - Don't make me sound so old. Why don't you sit down, I'll order up some more coffee. - None for me, thanks. - Not for me either. I really better get going. Thanks, man. Jamie, see you later. - I heard your demo. Kelly was right, you're good. - Thank you, Mr. Hubbard. - Jeb. - Thank you, Jeb. - I tell you what I'm gonna do. I'll put you under personal contract. But you have to agree to a number of conditions. - Such as? - First of all, you're an unknown. You need a lot of work. Promotion, buildup, right songs, right exposure. Not much will be coming in at first. - I don't mind, honest. - Second, you have to promise to do whatever I ask you to do. Third, I get 50 percent of your earnings for a manager's fee. And I've also got a seven year option on you and all your services exclusively. - What do you mean by option? - That means every six months if I wanna continue, you have to stay with me till the seven years are up. - [Jamie] And he gave me a hundred a week extra earnings. - Cheapskate. - A hundred a week! - Well that's chicken feed. Has he screwed you yet? - He hasn't even made a pass at me yet. - He will. (birds chirping) - It's like I said Jamie, image is what counts. Not just talent. We're gonna give you a whole brand new image, me and May Oxton. She's the best publicist in her field. - And I already have your official bio prepared. - What's a bio? - That's the story of your life that we send out with your press releases. Introducing Melody Mason. - I thought you were writing about me. - Well from now on, you are Melody Mason. I thought up the name myself. - This 14 year old beauty from Okinaw County, West Virginia is the youngest of seven children. Her father worked as a coal miner until he was killed in a mine explosion when she was only three. Tragedy struck again in the Mason household when the family car driven by her mother crashed into a cement truck on the way back from church on Sunday morning. Only Melody survived. Thereafter, Melody was raised by her grandparents in Wheeling, West Virginia where she sang in the choir at the First Baptist Church. Her grandparents, strict and decent folk wanted her to become a school teacher. But Melody was interested only in becoming a country Western singer. With the money she saved from babysitting and working in a school cafeteria, she bought tickets to hear her favorite country western singers when they came to Wheeling. Melody was discovered when her music teacher went to see Jeb Hubbard, America's beloved country western singer who is the holder of six gold records. She told him about Melody. And Jeb was so impressed by the sincerity of the teacher that he agreed to listen to Melody. After one listen to the girl with the smile and the tear in her voice, he immediately saw her tremendous potential and put her under personal contract. Soon Melody will be traveling all over the United States with Jeb, his wife Fran, and Jeb's famous country westerners. - [Jamie] You and Jeb been married a long time, haven't you? - 20 years, four kids, approximately 500,000 miles. And he didn't have anyone to sponsor him when he started. I wanna tell you honey, it wasn't easy. He used to drive around in an old beat up station wagon, not a luxury bus like this. - I'm sure glad that Jeb took me in, I'm really grateful. - You're young and pretty. I guess you can have whatever you want but I don't know if I'd trade places with you. - What do you mean? - Well she means exactly what I told you. Being a country western singer's a hell of a lot of work. - But look at the reward. - Hah, like an ulcer. If it weren't for Fran here I wouldn't be on the road right now. Mama really takes good care of me. - Well somebody's gotta look after you. You ain't doing it yourself.

My name's Jamie. - It's Melody, you hear!? Now here's a young girl whose popularity is rising fast. Folks, the darling of young and old alike, Melody Mason. (crowd applauding) - Thank y'all. Y'all made me really happy. When I started out, Jeb asked me what I wanted out of life. And I'll tell you what I told him. I wanted to sing and make people happy even when they're sad. And now I'd like to sing for you my latest song which was just recorded on the JH label.

Come here. Hey there for a minute I thought you were almost glad to see me. - I was, I am. What brings you way out here? - Would you believe you or a music gig, huh? - A gig. - A gig. Well you think anything you like but I sure am glad to see you, a star. - Kelly, I have a show to do in 45 minutes. - Well I just happen to be available tonight. - Look, I'm in 209. I've got to get dressed now. - Talk to you, kid. See you tonight. - What's the idea of going through my mail? - There's nothing else to do. Started with the Gideon bible and ended up with your mail. You really send money to your old man after what he did to you? - None of your business. - Hey your sister really thinks you're something. - We've kept close. - Jamie. (sighing) Come here. - Kelly, I said you could come to my room not climb into my bed. - Come here. - Kelly, do me a favor. Get dressed and get out. - Hey I can't do that, the place is booked. You wouldn't do that to an old friend, would you? - Yeah. - I'll get you that new set of teeth, can of fishing worms you wanted. - Out! - Jamie, please. - All right, you can stay. But not in my bed. - [Kelly] Which bed do you want? - Doesn't matter. - Why? - You wouldn't understand. Maybe I don't. Maybe some other time. (crickets chirping) - You sure took your sweet time this morning. - I couldn't help it, something came up. - I just bet it did. - You don't own my private hours, Jeb. What I do is my business. It's the first time I've ever been late. So now who's holding up the show? (revving) Gin! I got it, wow. - Wow, you learn fast. - Well I'm trying. - Can I give you a piece of advice? - Sure. - Be more patient with Jeb, will you honey? Sometimes he still thinks he's 21. But he's really tired and he's getting older. He just don't let himself admit to any of it. - Well I'm tired too, he's not the only one that's working. - Yeah but he's the one time's running out on. You got your whole life ahead of you. Just hold back. Don't fight him so much. He'll come around to his senses, he always does. By god I've picked up the pieces so many times I can't even remember. But he always comes around. (revving) (knocking) - Can I come in a few minutes? - Of course. - Come here. - Jeb, Jeb. Jeb. Don't, Jeb. - Well just, just listen to me. Let me try and explain. When I first heard your demo, I knew that there was a talent. A real big honest to goodness talent. So I made up my mind right there that old Jeb Hubbard was gonna stay off the girl. Now you got to admit I lived up to what I promised you. - You have. - Well. I also knew I was falling in love with you. Now you don't think I'd let any other chick take that much applause on my show. But I held back and I held back. And then when I saw Kelly in your dressing room, shit, I don't know how to say it. - I wish you wouldn't. Fran and I are friends. She is a lovely woman, she loves you. Now-- - No, fuck Fran! - Then go and fuck her, but not me! I like you. I appreciate all that you've done for me. But from now on, it's gonna be talent and nothing else. I wanna become what the public thinks I am. - You mean you want your virginity back? (slamming) - I don't know why you're still so upset, Jeb. - Well that don't surprise me none. - Is it the girl? - What girl? - Melody. - I don't give a damn if you believe it or not. But I didn't screw her. (slamming) (light country rock music) ♪ You said you were ready ♪ ♪ Come on be my eagle ♪ ♪ Come and fly ♪ ♪ High with your doves ♪ - Hold it, hold it!

(slapping) - Bitch, you know damn good what I was talking about! You're trying to take my audience away from me! - Jeb, you are crazy. - I got the heights now. - Jeb! Let go of me! Ow! Ow, ow. Jeb! (grunting) (tense music) (breathing heavily) - Honey, I'm sorry. - Go away. Just, get out of my life. I don't want you and I don't need you anymore. - You mean you don't want me to fuck you because you don't need me? - Did I fuck you before? - Physically no. Mentally yeah. You made a play for me all this time. - I'm gonna tell you something, Jeb Hubbard. I paid my dues to get to where I am today. And I paid them before I ever met you. I paid them to you not in sex but in dollars and cents. When you signed me and took 50 percent of my earnings I was very naive. So don't think that I got something for nothing. Now it is over, finished ,through. Now you just get out of here. - Okay. I'll get out. But I'll be back tomorrow night, you better be willing. - Who the hell do you think you are, God? Now you hear me. If you show your face here again, I'll tell everybody what you did here tonight and how you raped a 17 year old girl. - 18. - Rape is rape! Now you hear me Jeb, you show your face here again, - Now I'm gonna tell you something, you little slut. Who's gonna believe a girl who worked in a massage parlor? Who's got a police record who was in a detention camp and who fucked everybody in town? They gonna believe you or me? And I'll tell you something else, Miss Melody Mason. They're gonna think I was taken in by you. Used by you. And I was whether you want to admit it or not. Now they're gonna feel sorry for me, not you. And it's your career that's gonna be finished, not mine. And you're gonna work for me and you're gonna fuck me until I tell you you're finished! (knocking) - Jamie! Jamie, Jamie, are you in there? Jamie! Jamie, what's wrong? (knocking) Jamie. Jamie, you left the phone off the hook. I knew something terrible happened to you. But this, Jamie, who did this to you? And why? - And that's about all of it. That's why I didn't want you coming to Nashville. That's what I couldn't tell you on the phone. But most of all, that's what I don't want you telling the folks. Pa would kill Jeb, and so would Ben and Clay and Jeremy. You know, he said I was leading him on. And you know something, Kathy, I was. - And you really think he'll do what he says he's gonna do if you don't play ball? - I don't know, Kathy, I'm so terribly tired. I can't think anymore. Maybe tomorrow I'll think of something. - Well you get a good night's sleep, Jamie, and maybe by in the morning I'll have found a solution. (light music) (sighing) - Kathy? Kathy, where are you? (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hello, Fran, is that you? - Yes of course it's me. Who's this? - Jamie. Is everything all right? - Yes of course everything's all right. Is Jeb there? - No, why do you ask? - A young girl came by about 45 minutes ago. She said that she was your sister Kathy. You told her to pick up Jeb and bring him by to your place because you wanted to talk to him. - [Jeb] I said slow down, dammit! - I'll slow down under one condition. - Anything! - You leave Jamie alone from now on, you hear me? - I promise, now will you please slow down? Look, you're making me nervous. Why don't you stop the car and let me drive back? - Okay. You're not gonna go back on your word, are you Jeb? - No I won't. (bashing) Now that's for that crazy ride you just took me on. And I'm gonna let you in on another little secret. If your sister can't tell me what to do, you sure as hell can't. (car starting) - [Jamie] I wanna talk to you. - [Jeb] You're already talking. - [Jamie] Where's my sister? - Your sister's up the road there about 28 miles, she's gonna walk. - I warned you to stay away from me. - I didn't, she came here! - What did you do to her? - I slapped her stupid little face which is what I should have done to you the first time you started acting uppity. - You ain't gonna slap her again. You ain't gonna slap me either 'cause I'm through! You don't own me. - Oh yes I do. I've got you under contract for another five years. And you're gonna do what I tell you to do. - Well if being Melody Mason means singing to your tune, you could take back your contract. You could take back your royalties and you could take back your whole goddamn character that you've created. I can go back to being Jamie Barker. And if that means starting all over again then that's what I'll do. I can make it on talent alone. And if I can't, I'll find some other way of earning a living. - You just can't walk out of your contract! - [Fran] Jeb. - You know what you can do with your contract. You can take your contract and shove it up your ass.
