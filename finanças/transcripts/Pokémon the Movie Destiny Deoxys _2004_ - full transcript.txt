[Pikachu] Pika! [Narrator] The Pokéball. An invention that's captured the imagination of people everywhere. Thanks to its ability to capture the most marvelous of creatures, Pokémon. And to catch one is an experience like none other. Each of these spectacular species has amazing powers and attributes that set them apart from one another in ways too numerous to list. What unique is they are individually, together they make up the incredible world of Pokémon. [Roaring] Pokémon and people like Ash Ketchum can come together as a team. For once they're captured in a Pokéball, Pokémon bond with their human trainers as friends, partners, family. On their journey of discovery trainers and their Pokémon learn as much about themselves as each other. And they also realize that there will always be more Pokémon than they could ever have imagined. You see, for each Pokémon that's discovered, there are dozens, perhaps hundreds more we have yet to meet. One thing's for sure, with each of these new Pokémon come new possibilities, new sToryes, new friendships and new adventures. Perhaps Pokémon trainers aren't the only ones to seek out new species. The Pokémon themselves seem to have an innate curiosity for the creatures of this world and of Worlds Beyond. After all, we may live on a Pokémon Planet, but nobody ever said that it's the only one. Professor, have you seen Tory? Take a look. Uh-huh. Impossible Keeping up with him. [Laugh] Spheal! Wow, it's a Spheal. Spheal! Spheal! Hi. Spheal. Spheal. Spheal. Spheaaalll!

[Humming] It's some kind of Pokémon, isn't it? Yes, Hmmm. It's a Pokémon from outer space. [Roaring] [Roar] [Roar] Rayquaza never leaves the ozone layer. Why Now? [Roar] It regenerated. But how's that possible? Let's go, it's too dangerous. Yeah. [Roaring] [Roaring] Ah! Are you okay? [Gasp] [Roaring] [Growl] Quick, follow me. I'm right behind you. Whoa! [Pained roar] Oh! -What is it? -Look at that! [Gasp] [Roaring] [Snarling and growling] [Roaring] [Roaring] [Helicopter whirring] Rayquaza is furious. Another Pokémon crossing into its territory has obviously threatened it. Mmm. Huh? Fire the laser. Raise our trajectory by point five. Right. That's the frequency. Finally in sync. That means.. Yes, the crystal should regenerate if we keep the laser on target. We will succeed. We have to. Hmm. [Machine powering down] We overloaded the regulator. Hmm.. It was just one small component that malfunctioned. A simple replacement. Good. We'll try again after it's fixed. Yes, sir. Huh? [Laughing] Guess what? I'm gonna tell you all about this book I'm reading. It's so good. Once that parts replaced we're almost home. Yeah, we're so close. Huh? I was right. I did see a glow. [Humming] [Humming] Wow! [Laughing] [Narrator] On his journey to become a Pokémon Master, Ash Ketchum and his friends arrive in LaRousse City. The headquarters for anything and everything high-tech. But he's not here for the gadgets and gizmos. Ash is itching for action at the town's famous battle tower. Pelipper! Seel? Ah! [Gasping] Aaah!

Watch out my brother rates really strong. Blaziken too! Bla-a-aze. Yeah, I'd love to have a battle with you, Ash. Let's get together at the battle tower, okay?

There, let's hurry! Oh! [Laugh] Uh-oh, now where are we? Oh wow, there's a library too. Pika. Excuse me? Huh? Pika! Aah! Hold on. What are you running away for? Pika? Wait! Hold up! Hi, let me start that again. We're on our way to a battle, but we don't know how to get there. So we're kind of lost. Pika Pika! Ah! Wait! We just wanna Are you ready for your battle? Right this way, gentlemen. I, you don't understand. If you hurry up, you two might just make it. But I haven't registered yet. That will all happen automatically. Now, good luck you two! [Computer] Passports confirmed. Two Youth Level participants entered successfully. Great! And just in time. Pika! [Computer] Entry for participants in the first round is closed. Please try again next time. What? Now introducing our first entry. Here we go. Pikachu! Our first match will be an official Battletower tag team event! Remember to cheer for your favorites! Tag team, huh? Yeah! We have Ash Ketchum in the Blue Corner. - Yes! A trainer all the way from Pallet Town. And his tag partner, Tory, a local trainer. All right, Tory. Good luck. Wonder how Ash got entered so quickly. By cutting in front of me. Rebecca. There comes a time in a man's life when he's presented with the gift of love at first sight. How about pain at first pull? Not the ear! [Girls giggling] Hm? Professor Lund? Take a look at this Tory? In a Pokémon Battle? And in the Red Corner, we have to two Trainers from South City. Rafe and Sid! Hey Ash, you sure didn't waste any time. 'Course not, I couldn't wait to beat you! Hey, May! Make sure you watch. I'm dedicating this battle to you. Basic rule that all Tag Team battles is teamwork. Each trainer uses a single Pokémon and works with his teammate. And now traitors bring out your Pokémon! All right, here goes! Blaze! Blastoise! Pikachu, I choose you! Pika! Pikachu! Tory, what Pokémon are you going to use? No Ash, I don't have any Pokémon. But.. Pika? There seems to be a problem. We've seen only one Pokémon from the Blue corner. See, I was trying to tell you I'm not a trainer. I can't battle. But this could end up being my only chance to battle Rafe. Hey, I know what! I'll loan you one of my Pokémon. What do you say? - Come on, that'll work. - But.. Will the Blue corner forfit? Don't let me down Tory. Well, if I have to! Tooor.. koal! Oh! Looks like we have our Pokémon! Ready for a battle? cause here we go. Let's do it! Blaziken, use Blaze Kick now! Dive Pikachu! Go Blastoise, Hydro Pump! Blast! Pika! It's a dazzling combination from the Red Corner! Blastoise, Bubble Attack! Blastoise! Torkoal! Tory, you have to tell Torkoal to do something! But, I don't know what to tell it. Blastoise, Rapid Spin! Blast.. Toise! Blaaas.. Toise! Toooor.. koooal! Blaas.. [Panting] Blastoise Blast.. toise! Pikachu, use Thunderbolt! Cover Torkoal! Piiika-chuuu! Blaziken! Blastoise, Skull Bash go! - Pika! - Toise. Torkoal.. Looks like the Blue corner just can't seem to get it together as a team. Man, Ash's partner isn't doing anything to help him out at all. I don't see how he could win. Come on, do something! Tory, don't worry. I'll take care of it. Flamethrower Torkoal, go! Torkoal. Tooor.. - ..Kooal! - Pika!! Whoa! A Flamethrower from Torkoal. But it hit Pikachu! How embarrassing. So Rafe, want to finish this one up? Let's go! Blaziken Overheat. Blaziken! Pika! Pikachu! Torkoal! And that's it. Pikachu and Torkoal are unable to battle. Rafe and Sid are the winners! Congratulations! Tory Daddy. We just watched your Pokémon Battle. I'm incredibly proud. Don't be. It was all an accident. It wasn't even supposed to happen. Yugo. Meeting you reminds me of a time in my life when I too spent long hours toiling as a professor's assistant. I'm sure Professor Ivy would be happy to vouch for my work. - Oh yeah. - I'll be happy to vouch for his insanity. We apologize for the mix-up with your battle. The truth is, Tory is completely afraid of Pokémon. How could he be afraid of Pokémon? Well, about four years ago, he had a very traumatic experience and it left him terrified of them. Sadly, he still hasn't managed to get over those fears. [Plusle chattering] Waaa! Shoo! Shoo! [Plusle chattering] [Plusle and Minun chattering] [Plusle chattering] Wow, I shouldn't have pushed him so hard. But underneath it all, I think he loves them. All he really needs is the chance to get to know them that's all. I'm sure that's all it'll take. Fine. Then I'll give him that chance. All he needs now is to become friends with me and Pikachu. Right pal? Pi. Pika. Yay, I want to help too! - So do I. - Me too. Cool. So what do you say we all go and look for Tory, okay? Yeah! You're awfully kind. Thank you. [Plusle and Minun chattering] [Groaning] Tory? Pika? Min! [Plusle and Minun chattering] [Plusle and Minun chattering] [Laughing] Aahh! Later! Pi? Pika. Munch Munch. Munch! Munch! Huh? Hey, come on out. Where are you? I want to tell you something important. You'll never guess what I just did. I helped out a Pokémon. Cause it had it's head stuck inside a garbage can and so I helped to get it out! Isn't that cool? [Laughing] [Humming] [Humming] [Humming] [Gasp] [Gasp in amazement] Hey, what are those lights? And I was even part of a Pokémon battle too. Course, I wasn't very good. So that part kind of stunk. Hey, who are you talking to? Pika? Hey, it's gone. Come on. Who was it? None of your business! What would it hurt to tell me? Stop! Leave me alone, okay? - Pi! - Wait a minute! If this town is so high-tech, why don't they have moving sidewalks? Or robots that serve hamburgers? Yeah... Keep dreaming. [All groaning] [All groan] I'll take a hamburger please! [Robot] Hamburger. Yum! [Excited chattering] [All] Hamburgers please! Passport. Passport. Passport What's a passport? Well, I have no idea what kind of pass he's talking about. But Meowth, please stop calling me sport. You idiot! Hamburger! Hey, that ain't right! Cheeseburger! Alert! - Alert! Alert! - Now! Now! Now! Come on! [Groaning] - Alert! - Aah! Alert! That was rude. Maybe she takes our order? Yeah.. Well, I'm pretty good at giving orders. So, I'm gonna have five hamburgers well done. And don't forget the french fries. Well done it is. [Screaming] Jesse got fried! Without the burgers! I think we should battle together again. Bet we'll get it right next time. Why do you keep following me? Aah! Are you Okay? Pikach- Ah! Pika? Gee, thanks. Why'd you have to go and push me? Ash, stop! Don't start something. Okay. Oh. Hey, I know! Pika? Mmm. Perfect. Dig in! I'll go first! Second. Hold on! O-o-oh! It's hot! Yum! There's nothing that can stop an argument better than a bunch of full mouths. Try some Tory. It's really good. You're right. Told you so! [All laughing] Guys. Look at all those Pokémon! Well, hi! There's plenty of Pokémon food. So don't be shy! There. Dig in guys. Tory, don't you think they're the cutest? Yeah. Hey, I bet they let you pet them. Pika! Piika. Pika? Thanks guys. I'm sorry. Well, we tried. Pika. Ah, I'm sure we'll get through to him eventually. Ah! Guys! Oh no! It's a Munchlax. And they love to eat. Well, guess it's doing what it loves. Hey you! That was our lunch! Munch! Munch. Munch. Munch Munch. Wow. Hey, it's a Plusle and Minun. Hi cuties. Pika, pika! [All three chattering] Murkrow! Murkrow! [Humming] [Humming] [Humming] [Humming] [Humming] [Humming] There's that light in the sky again. Awesome. It's beautiful. Huh? But that's impossible. What is? That's called an aurora. But it can only be seen at the North and South Poles Strange. Well, then, I guess we're lucky to be able to see it here. Right? The same kind of luck that brought you and me together. Right babe? Haha! Not sure what kind of luck that was. Hi beautiful. If you're looking for a real phenomenon, stop looking in your computer and spend some time with me! Oookay.. You leaving her alone. That's a phenomenon. Well, look who's still in town. So? So well, after that devastating defeat in front of thousands of people, I thought you might be a little embarrassed to show your face. Oh yeah? How about a rematch tomorrow? In the battle tower? No problem. I'll beat you anytime and anywhere I wouldn't count on that! Pika? Hey, I know you Tory. Hey, you guys. Yuko and I made these for you. Cool! Pokémon cookies. - Cute. - Yummy. Come on out everyone. When is a sandwich more than a sandwich? When the sandwiches are meal.. ..for Team Rocket to steal. Dinner! Aaah! Huh? Did that just happen? Munchlax munch! It's stealin' da' food we were stealin'! Oh, no it's not! [Growling] Come back here you little.. [Muttering] It's gone. [Humming] [Humming] [Humming] [Roaring] [Roar] You know, I've never done that before. What? Just playing together with a big bunch of friends. Really? Yeah, I guess it's because I've always been so afraid of Pokémon. So I'm afraid to get close to Pokémon trainers too. Guess I've missed out on a lot. That means you're always alone. Pika. Pikachu. But that's all in the past, right? Pika! Corphish! [Pokémon chattering] Phish! Corphish! It's okay. There's no rush. Okay. That's Corphish. Cor? Piiika.. Phish. Come on guys, There's someone I want you to meet. Where are we going? Wherever it is, I hope there's a kitchen. I'm starving. Your passports please. Verified! My dad's lab is right over there. So that's why there are so many security robots all over. Haha! Come on out. I'm with my new friends! Come and meet 'em! So, this is your friend Tory? Hmm. Wha-what is it? It's gorgous! And weird. It's always here for me. Whenever I call for it. Yesterday, I played with all these guys and their Pokémon too. [All gasp] Well Tory, that's so cool! And even understands what I say. Is it a Pokémon? Not one that I've ever seen. This is just fascinating. What do you say I introduce my Pokémon to it? Go! Blaaze! Yeah, mine too! [Both] Don't forget ours! Now, let me introduce mine. Metagross. A Metagross! Awesome! Meta. Pika. Pi? I.. Gotcha! Missed it. Pika! Piika. Pi. [Chuckles] [Roaring] [Roaring] Unidentified object approaching the building. Can you analyze it, please? It appears to be Rayquaza. Rayquaza? Contact Professor Lund right now. Right! Professor. How could a Rayquaza be coming here? I don't know. But for it to leave the ozone layer again, there must be a powerful reason. [Gasp] Do you see that? Huh? I'll magnify it. That's what I thought. It's Deoxys. [Humming] [Humming] [Computer] System malfunction. Losing regulatory control. Rayquaza must have come here after sensing that Deoxys was here as well. If those two battle it out in our city, The result will be catastrophic. Evacuate LaRousse City immediately. Right away, sir. Initiating emergency evacuation Fellow citizens. We are facing an emergency situation. Please evacuate immediately. Hey! It's party time! Please be patient. The next ferry will arrive shortly. [Humming] What's that? It sounds like the police. Huh? Tory's out in the garden. I have to go out and get him. Everyone, evacuate immediately! Right. Why won't your passport work? This never happens. Maybe the system is shutting down. It stopped. [Computer] Rebooting. Oh! Hey! [Gasp] It's moving - Where we going? [Gasp] - Excuse me. - Watch it! Ooh! Professor Lund! Oh.. Some vacation this turned out to be. Whose bad idea was this? Let's just say Meowth and I were overruled. - Oh? - Hm? [Humming] [Humming] [Humming] Aah! [Screaming] What's happening here? Those things are carrying people away. Deoxys. Why are you doing this to us? Huh? [Roaring] [Humming] [Roaring] The forcefield! [Computer] Losing power. All systems will now shut down. [Humming] [Roar] [Roaring] [Roar] [Roar] [Roaring] [Groaning] [Humming] You got it! Hold on a sec. [Humming] It's multiplying. What is that thing? Deoxys. You know its name? You guys, come back! [Gasp] No! May look out! Hey, what do you want? Blastoise use Hydro Pump, go! Blastoise! Blast! - Toise! - Put me down! Blastoise! Blast! Sid, no! May, get in here! Blaziken use Flamethrower. Blaaaze! Pikachu, Thunderbolt! Pika-chuuu! Tory, is there another way out? Yeah, there's an underground exit. Can you show us? Yes, follow me. Everyone, let's go. Blaaze! Chuuu! Blaaze! Way to go Rafe. Heh, all in a day's work. What do they want? Let's hurry. Come on Brock, it's open. Okay. All right, Ash. Rafe. We gotta go! - [Ash] Pikachu! - Pika! Blaze. [Grunting] - [Ash] Ahh! - Blaze. Guys, this way! Pika. Pika! Pikachu, use Thunderbolt now! Pika-chuuu! Thanks Pikachu. Good Thunderbolt.. [Groan] Ash, what are you doing? Let's go. This is the way to get out of here! Wonder where we are now? It seems to be safe. There you are. It's Yuko. [Various Pokémon chattering] Huh? Min? Munch. [Gasp] Munch? Munch. Munch. Munch. [Growling and roaring] Professor, take a look at all of these people shown here. Their evacuation hasn't been confirmed that any of the passport check points. I'm afraid that could mean they're still stuck in LaRousse . The entire town is enclosed within a force field. It's impossible for anyone to come in or to leave. All communication with the outside is jammed as well. They've switch to backup generators. But all systems are still down. Even the Pokéball management system isn't functioning. Yeah, won't work. How can we call out our Pokémon? Guess we can't. Hey Tory. What did you call that thing? Was it Deoxys? Mhmm. That's right. A Pokémon from outer space. What? Four years ago, a meteorite came down and struck the North Pole. And located inside of it was a completely unknown Pokémon. It was Professor Lund who gave that Pokémon the name Deoxys. But then, almost immediately Rayquaza appeared from the ozone and attacked Deoxys. Apparently, Rayquaza was threatened and thought Deoxys was invading its territory. Deoxys vanished deep into the sea. I don't get it. How could it be the same Deoxys? After getting beaten by Rayquaza, Deoxys must have slowly been regenerating. Regenerating? That's right. It has astounding regenerative powers. And that's what Professor Lund and I have been studying all these years. It sounds more like science fiction. This is something I'd love to research. But I wonder if.. ..it could somehow get in through a crack in the wall. [Gasp] Knock it off Max! Stop scaring us right now! Haha. Just kidding. There's no way it's coming in through a crack. [Screaming] What was that? Come on, Blaziken. Blaze. Pika. [Chattering] Pika! Munch. Hey, that's the Pokémon that ate every bite of our food. Are you stuck in there Munchlax? Let's see. [Groaning] Oh, our sandwiches! Everything but the peanut butter. Hmm. And of course, that one was mine. [Minun and Plusle chattering happily] Hold on. Okay, Please, just don't come any closer you two. Pika. Pikachu. Munch. - Aww, I'm so hungry. - So am I. Me too. Muu? Munchlax! Really? I can have it? [Gasp in amazement] Hmm? [All] No, thanks. Oh! [Groan] [Groan] We have to find food and water right away. Great. And I'll try and find out where those people were taken. Yuko. Take care of my sisters, please. Of course. But don't you worry about us. You take care of yourselves. We will. All right, let's go. Muuunchlax. Muuunchlax. I'm worried, Max. I really hope they're all okay. Yeah, me too. I wish they'd hurry and come back. Plu-uh! Min. Minu-min! [Minun and Plusle chattering] Still no good. Nothing's happening. Yeah, it must be tied into the town system. I can see the food in there too. We just need to figure out a way to break in. Pika-pika! Hm? Piika-chuuuu! [Gasp] It worked! Pikachu, great idea. Pikachu! Whoa! Gotta catch 'em all! Hah hah! Pika-Pi. Piikachu. Pi? Pika? What is it, Pikachu? Oh! Look out! - Run! - Pika! Pikaa! Plusle! Minun! Pluu! Min! Get down! Let go! Chuuu! [Yelling] [Both Grunt] Pikachu! - Whaaa! - Min! Oh! Nooo! [Groaning] [Minun yelling out] Pika! [Plusle chattering] Here they all come, guys! Pika! Come on Tory. Let's go. Looks like they're all gone. That was close. Oh Plusle. It's all my fault.. I shoulda. Mmm. I'm sorry. Pika. Pika Pika. Pikachu. Ash. Look what I just found. Precious water. All right! Okay. So that's where they're holding everyone captive. I guess.. But what in the world for? Release immediately. Release immediately. [Fading voice] Release immediately.. [Powering down] Release.. Imm..edi..ate... It let go. But why? [Roaring] [Roaring] Hm? Go back. Let me just take another look at that. Sure. Skit? Sur! Surskit! Surskit! Sur! What is it? What's wrong? Pika? Hm? Blaze? [Scream] Let's get out of here. Yes. There's an underground laboratory. Let's go! Follow me. Munchlax! Try and stay calm. Now go. We should be safe down here for the time being. That's good. Blaze. Blaze. Pika. What's this? The lab where we studied Deoxys and it's regeneration. There were actually two of them before. Rayquaza defeated one, while the other Deoxys was still dormant inside of this meteorite. - So then you're saying that.. - Yes, that crystal. It's a part of Deoxys. Part of what do you mean? Pika. [Gasp] What? Hey Tory, it's your friend. Pika. Wait a second. Then Tory's friend is.. Right, it's Deoxys. [Gasp] Oh! That's it. It all makes sense. This is Tory's friends, light pattern. And this is the pattern of the aurora that covered LaRousse . It's the same. Yeah, I think it might be how they communicate. Oh, I see. So, can you tell what it says? Well, let's start with the green pattern. This one means friend. And this one seems to be asking "Where are you?" So it's just looking for its friend? Pika! Of course! Deoxys carried off all those people and Pokémon because they were interfering while it's searched for its friend. What? Deoxys see certain types of electrical fields. But it's not only electrical devices that give off those fields. So do people and Pokémon. And they were blocking its vision. That's why it's moving them out of the way, to find it! Mmm! [Humming] [Humming] Please Yuko. You got to help this Deoxys regenerate. It's so sad. It's been alone all of this time. You're right! Once Deoxys finds its friend, it'll go back home. Pikachu! But the problem is the emergency power were running on now isn't nearly enough necessary to operate this device. If it's electricity you want, then I'm your guy. I can get the wind generators going. Can we help? Yes, we'll need everyone's help to save those people and Pokémon. Let's start working on a plan and then we'll go out to where they're being held. I'll zero in on it. That's where they all are. Great. Let's go get them guys. [All] Alright! I'll never take an escalator for granted again. [Humming] [Humming] Oh! Deoxys! We're not your enemies! We're your friends. [Humming] If you just trust us, we can help you find your friend. I promise! [Humming] Blaziken use Flamethrower now! Pikachu Thunderbolt 'em! [Pikachu and Plusle yelling out] Metagross, use Reflector. Metaaa.. Quick! Now's our chance! This way! Now, Overheat! Blaaaze! Ooh. You okay? We're fine Ash, just go on! Rafe can handle it. Just don't let anything happen to my sister's Ash. You can count on that. Blaziken, Overheat! Blaze! [Humming] [Roaring] [Roaring an attack] [Roaring] Rayquaza has broken through. What have I done? [Humming] Relax, Blaziken. [Roar] [Roaring] [Roaring] [Roaring] [Roar] [Roaring] [Roaring] Rayquaza! Now what's that? [Roaring] [Roaring] [Roaring] Alright, now let's do it just like we planned. Okay, guys? Gotcha. We're with you Ash. Munchlax! Come on! There's no time for you to go back for it. Munchlaaax! You ready? Just about. All we need the electricity, But.. If we had that, we wouldn't need to fix it. What are they doing over there? I'm hoping he pulls a sandwich outta that box. From your lips to my stomach. You guys! We've come to help you! Hey Ash. We're up here! You got Pikachu and Plusle, right? Yeah. We're all set. - Pika! - Plusle! [Roaring] [Roaring] [Roaring] [Roaring] [Humming] [Growl] [Ash] Pikachu, [Troy] Plusle, [Both] Thunderbolt, now! [Both yelling out] There's your electricity. That's good. Stop. Alright. We're recharged! Yeah! Alright! Min mu-min! Oof! Ouch. [Plusle and Minun chattering happily] You were great Tory. [Roaring] [Humming] [Roaring] [Roaring] [Panting] [Humming then roaring] [Roaring] [Roar] [Humming] [Roaring] - Let's go. - Yeah. Pika. That should do it. Coming down. Hey May, I'm coming for ya! Was that Sid? [Both] Oh! And Rafe! Maaaay! Oof! Gross. Metagross. Audrey. Catherine, you okay? Uh-huh! We're fine. Where's Ash and the others? They went back to the laboratory. Okay. Are you ready to get started on this? Perfect. The powers back on. Yeah, those guys pulled it off. Mhmm. Blaziken! Blaziken! Metagross. My cramp's getting a cramp We're always spinnin' our wheels but dis is ridiculous. Just petal! I'm set. Are you both ready to use the laser? Yes. I think you should turn it on Tory. It is your friend, after all. So you should do it. Hmm! Pi? Here goes. Still no good. Oh, no, we're still 20 percent short on energy. Wow, we're so close. Okay, Pikachu, Plusle, Minun. You know what to do. - Pika! - Min! Plusle! Great idea. We got just what we need. It works. Alright! [All gasp] We did it! Deoxys. It's really you. [Humming] Deoxys. Do you want to go find your friend now? [Humming] [Humming] Oh! Pika! Oh! [Humming] [Roaring] [Roaring] [Humming] [Humming] Oh! [Trilling] The force field's gone. Just like that? [Roaring] [Roaring] [Humming] [Roaring] [Humming] [Roar] Pika! [Humming] [Humming] [Humming] [Laughing] - Pika. [Roaring] - Oh! - Pika! [Roaring] Hey, knock it off! Stop Rayquaza! Pika! [Roaring] [Roaring] Warning! Warning! Warning! Danger. Danger. Danger. Evacuate. Evacuate. What happened? Security somehow started up. [Roaring] Warning. Evacuate. Warning. Ee..vacuate. Warning. Ee..vac..uate.. Somehow security has gone on overdrive. It won't shut down. - Yuko! - Professor Lund. [Roaring] [Roaring] [Roaring] [Humming] [Roaring] Everything's totally out of control! Ash, I'm scared. [Roaring] Rayquaza! Deoxys! Pika! Whoa! Plusle. Minun. Pikachu! They almost hit us that time. Let's try and get back to Yuko. Tory can you hear me? - Tory! - Daddy! You must listen to me very carefully. As you can see, all of the block robots are malfunctioning. The chief robot, which controls all other block robots should be near you. We no longer have power over that robot from the booth. Understand? So here's what you have to do. And I need for you to be brave Tory, do you have your passport?
