- Good morning, Emnet. - Good morning. Good morning, Mrs... Belaynesh. Come into my office. What can I do for you, Mrs Belaynesh? I heard that you... It's OK. He has always been an angry man, but he didn't drink so much before. Now all he does is drink. When he comes home, he'll find any reason to hit me. I went to some family members. They said, "He hits you because he loves you. "Your husband is a kind man. Go back to your house." Why don't you give me your address and phone number? I'll talk to him. We don't have a phone. Where do you live? His name is Zenebe. He works at a construction site next to St Gabriel church. If he finds out I came to talk to you, - he will kill me... - Don't worry, Mrs Belaynesh. There are laws in this country. No one is above the law. Hirut! You've missed one question. It asks for the distance, not the time. If Abebe takes 60 minutes to run 12 kilometres, and 20 minutes to run four kilometres, how far would he run in 120 minutes? The correct answer is 24 kilometres. The rest is good. I'm putting in a recommendation to promote you to fifth grade. Please let me go! Mama! Please let me go! Please! Let me out! Mama! Excuse me, I'm looking... for Mr Zenebe, please. I'm Zenebe. You are Mr Zenebe? Mrs Belaynesh's husband? - How do you know my wife? - Mr Zenebe, is that your girlfriend? I'm here to let you know that if you ever touch your wife again I'll have you arrested. Listen, you little shit, I'm old enough to be your father. And man enough to beat your wife, right? You want to keep your job, be nice to your wife. Take this. It's coffee. Don't worry. You will soon be my wife. Tadele! What is it? It's nothing. I thought I saw people coming this way. Have some coffee. The girl is strong. She almost tipped me off the horse. But she's good-looking. - That's true. - Good genes. She got away! There she is. Get her. Don't come any closer! Don't come any closer. I'm not going to tell you again. Get her. - Cut her throat! - No, let me go! Mama! Stop. Get off the girl. Get off! She just killed a man. She should be killed. You know the rules. We are civilian police, chosen by the people of this village. We're taking the girl to the police. - You wanted to see me? - Yes. They are holding a young girl at a police station in the village. They say she killed her abductor. They are going to kill the poor girl. Did you call our regional office there? No, I just heard this on the radio. Hello, Etaferaw, it's Meaza. Did you hear anything about a young girl who's being held at the police station? Can you go there and find out about it, please? Thank you. - Are you all together? - No, we're not. We are here for Hirut. - Do you have food? - Yes. - Yes, we do. - Bring it here. Open it. - Open it. - OK. - Eat it. - Sorry, but we brought it for Hirut. I understand. You have to eat it so I know you didn't put poison in there. It's policy. In the name of God, poison? Hold this. Follow me. You wait here. Welcome. How are you? Here is the girl's file. Her name is HirutAssefa. She's 14. What do you mean, she's 14? She's 14 years old? And she killed a man? That's what the police report says. She's being held without bail and with limited visitation. - We are here to see Hirut. - What are you to her? We are her lawyers. She doesn't need lawyers. She knows what she did. She killed a man and she's going to pay for it with her life. That's not for you to decide. Teshome! Take her to the little girl. Don't think that you can save this girl's life. How are you doing, Hirut? My name is Meaza Ashenafi, and this is Etaferaw Teshager. We are lawyers. Do you know what a lawyer is? No. Why are you angry? It's OK. We are not the police. All I wanted was to get back to my parents. It's going to be OK. I'll take you to a hospital. I'm coming back to get you. I'm here to represent Hirut Assefa. She needs medical attention. And, on behalf of Andinet Women Lawyers Association, I would like to post bail and take her to hospital. You know I can't do what you're asking me to do. She is in for murder. Besides, you are not authorised to represent her in this region. She is 14 years old, sir, and she has a broken arm. She might have other injuries that we don't know about. And we do have a representative in this region. The Assistant DA thinks that she's lying about her age. He thinks she is much older than that. Besides, I just can't let you take her without her parents' permission, since she's 14. Come in. Sir, we are all ready. I'm sorry. Good afternoon. - Are you Hirut's mother? - Yes, I am. I don't think I remember who you are. You wouldn't know me, ma'am. We came to talk to you about Hirut, if that's OK. Well, don't stand in the sun. Come inside. Aregash, light the lantern. Please don't bother. We are comfortable. It's been hard since they took Hirut. I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't know where to go. We help women and girls like Hirut, who are in legal trouble and don't get proper professional representation. But we don't have anything to pay you. We are poor farmers, as you can see. Money is not necessary. Our service is free. It's her father's fault. He insisted that she should go to school. All of this wouldn't have happened if she had stayed at home and helped her parents, like I did when I was a little girl. I think you are mistaken. Your husband did the right thing. What I need is your permission to represent Hirut legally. It's OK by me. But it's her father who makes decisions around here. You have to talk to him. - Where is your husband? - He's out in the field, farming. Excuse me, I've got to get more wood from the back. Hirut is never coming home, is she? Meseret never came back. - Who is Meseret? - She's my sister. She's been gone a long time. - Aregash. - Yes. They are lawyers. They came to help us. Help us with what? My name is Meaza. This is Etaferaw. If you want your daughter back... I strongly suggest that you sign this paper. Is this going to start a war with his family? Ato Assefa, your daughter is hurt. She has been raped. For all I know, she might get pregnant. So what do you want me to do now? All you have to do is sign this paper. I don't know how to read or write. Let me help you. This paper shows that you gave us your permission to represent your daughter in a court of law. Give me your finger. I just want to ask you one more question. How old is Hirut? She is a kid. Her little sister was born on the day of St Mary in the year that I lost my mother. And my mother's ten-year anniversary was two years ago. That makes her 12. So Hirut is 14. She's 14. I need to be sure that she's 14. Because the police think that she's older. You can ask the church. All my daughters are baptised. Thank you very much for everything. We should be going. You can't leave without eating lunch. That's rude. I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to be rude. We just have to get back to the police station. That is not acceptable. You must not forget your culture. It is our tradition. Come now, come into the house. The father's signature, the regional work permit, and a baptism record from a church showing when Hirut and her sisters were baptised. According to that record, she is 14. If it's OK, we'd like to take Hirut to the hospital now. It's not going to be that easy. I'm the Assistant DA for the region. Meaza Ashenafi, Andinet. - What is your name? - Gizaw. This is Etaferaw Teshager, Andinet. The police report shows that she shot him with his own rifle a day after her abduction. Does the police report also show that she was raped, beaten up badly and might have a broken arm? Are you telling me that she's 14 years old? But what I don't understand is, where did she learn to use a semi-automatic machine gun? And how did she run with a gun that probably weighs as much as she does? I don't know, but nearly every farmer owns one, so it couldn't have been completely foreign. And every girl carries a much heavier burden than a rifle around here. Do you have children, Ato Gizaw? Are your children baptised? You know that baptism records are not credible. We need proof. Hard evidence, like a birth certificate. Are you kidding me? Since when have poor farmers been getting birth certificates? They don't even get vaccinations. I'd be careful what I say, if I were you. It's an unfounded accusation to say that the state is not doing its job. You know that is not what I'm saying. And I won't be that easily intimidated, if that's what you're getting at. You have seen my documentation. - The girl is underage. - We don't know that yet. What do you propose we should do to verify that? She will be sent to a government hospital to determine her age. What hospital? Where? You know there isn't a specialist or a hospital that can do that in this country. You are holding a little girl in your jail cell who needs medical attention. All I'm asking you is to let me take her to hospital. Excuse me, I must go to court. I think we should invite Hirut's parents tomorrow morning. I think you're right. Meaza, come in! You've grown thin. Are you eating enough? Enough to survive. - I'm hungry! Let's eat? - OK. How is work? I have to say, it's different from working for you. You didn't work for me. You worked for the Transitional Government of Ethiopia. I just happened to be your boss. I have a favour to ask. Is there anybody that you can talk to? They aren't letting me take the little girl to hospital. She's hurt. - Let me see what I can do. - Thank you. So, how is your guy? Does he call? Yes, he does. But, he doesn't want to move to Addis Abeba. He'll change his mind. You'll see. You two will be married and live happily ever after. Well, you didn't get married. So you aren't qualified to advise in that regard. But of course. I've been happily married to the law for 45 years. Hello, Alemu? Can you come with the reporters tomorrow morning? To the village police station. Do you think you can get her out? - How did they hear about this? - I don't know. Let's go inside. Meaza, do you think Hirut is going to be released today? Is that it, or are we expecting any more people? This is Hirut's family. Her mother and father, her younger sister Aregash, her older sister Meseret, and Meserefs children. This is Dr Tamrat. He is the region's chief medical investigator. He is here to help us determine the girl's true age. I have examined the prisoner. And it is obvious that the prisoner is well into her late teenage years. We can see that without the help of any scientific evidence. The girl is well developed. With all due respect, Dr Tamrat, it is insulting to call her "the prisoner". Her name is Hirut. It is also insulting to Hirut and her family that you think she's older than she is because she has developed breasts. Look at her younger sister. She's only 12. Ms Meaza, the priso... Hirut is 18 years of age or in the vicinity of that age. Yes, sir, he is. Gizaw, it's for you. This is Gizaw. Yes. I understand, sir. Very well. Can you ask your clients to wait for you outside, so we can talk in private? I've been instructed to release the prisoner to Andinet after you post bail. From here on, all communications will be through your office. And Andinet is responsible for making sure that the prisoner appears at all of her appointments. Thank you. We would like to have all communications handled through our office here. Meaza, how do you feel now that Hirut is released? Is Hirut free? Does this mean she didn't kill the man? Hirut is out on bail. At the moment, we are taking her to hospital. She is going to be represented by Andinet Women Lawyers Association. Our regional office and Etaferaw Teshager will lead the defence. - What is she charged with? - Hirut is charged with murder. We have requested the full police report, and we will appear in court to defend these charges. Thank you. I'm Alemu, you called me last night. You promised to talk to me. Good morning! Praise God. I think everyone concerned with this matter is here. The reason for this gathering is to discuss Hirut and the man she killed. If there are no objections, we'd like to go forward with the hearing. First, Tadele's father, what do you say to this gathering? I stand before you today as a childless father. I am fruitful, thanks to the Lord. But a fruit of my life has been taken away from me unjustly - by a girl that he wanted to marry. - That's true. My son's wish was to get married. Following his tradition, he abducted her. Only to find that the girl I thought would be my daughter-in-law became the cause of my misery. That's true. Abducting for marriage is our tradition. It's not only here. The highlanders in the north do it. The southerners in Hawassa do it. Hell, I abducted my wife. But she knew better, she didn't go for my rifle. I say it is her teacher's fault. Bad parenting too, of course. But it is these city people with their ties and jackets and books who are ruining our tradition. Is this what you teach our daughters? To disobey men? Not to respect our fathers? Or do you teach them to kill their husbands? We teach your children to read and write, so they can help you better. You must have forgotten, Alemayehu, I was also brought up here. I went to the city to learn, so one day I could help my village. Well, look how you turned out. You aren't even married. Yet you're older than my son, who's already got two children. Order. Order. Now, the girl's father, what do you say to us? The good Lord honoured me with three girls. They are not boys, but they are good girls. My oldest daughter got abducted. She loved running. She ran like the wind. Won all kinds of medals, too. But she got abducted. I let her go for fear of bloodshed. Now she lives with a drunk and four children. But Hirut, she is a difficult girl. Stubborn. She has always been. She almost killed her mother at birth. All she wanted to do was to go to school, so one day she could go to the university in the city. She didn't want to end up like her sister. When his son came and asked me for Hirut's hand, I told him, "She is just a girl. She is not ready." But that didn't matter, his son had decided to abduct her all along. She did what she did to come home to me. It was his son's fault for taking her against her will. Your daughter is too good for my son? Huh? Stop! Please stop! Please, this is not a duel. We are here to resolve a grave matter. Isn't it? - It is. - It's true. Tadele's father, what do you want from this court? I'm an old man. I don't have many days left for me out on the farm. My son was the future of my family. But he is dead now. So, as it is with our tradition, the girl must be killed immediately and be buried with the man she killed. Yes. That's right. If this court fails to do that, I'll take matters into my own hands and swear vengeance on her family. That's correct. That should be the decision. Yes! This is very unusual. That the girl is in police custody makes the matter difficult to judge. Also, since the person in question is but a little girl, it makes the case unusual and hard. So we have decided the girl's father will pay the sum of 3,000 Birr, or the equivalent in livestock, in compensation for the bloodshed. As for the girl, she is to be exiled to a place far away from this village. We hope that this judgement will ease the burden felt by the deceased's family. This is not fair. She must die. No. It's not right! Our decision is final and not open to negotiation. We are done with our work here. You'll stay here with me until you feel better. Then we'll find a place for you to stay. Let me show you around the house. Here is the bathroom, if you want to wash, and, you know, go pee. And this is the kitchen. I cook my food here. And this is a refrigerator, I keep my food here. You're hungry. I'll make us something. Go ahead and sit down. Eat. Why don't you have a husband? I don't know. My mother always asks that question. Are you a bad woman? Because in the village, when a girl is married, if she is not a virgin, the husband throws her out of his house. She can't even get back to her family. They say she disgraced the family and she's forced to live by herself. - Did you disgrace your family? - No. I didn't disgrace my family. You see, when I was a little girl, I grew up in a village just like yours. I have five brothers and I am the only girl. My mother made sure I was raised equally with my brothers. So I went to school with them every day. And I knew I didn't want to get married and have children like everybody else in the village, either. Men kept asking my father to give me to their sons. He told them that I was a difficult child. Not wife material. Of course, he was lying. So they didn't try to abduct you after your father refused? I guess I was lucky that I had a lot of brothers. No one dared to bother me because my brothers were always there. After high school, I moved to the city and I was accepted into the university. Do you wish you were married? No. I think about it sometimes, though. But I'm always working. I think men are afraid to marry me because I don't always stay at home. I'm not a virgin any more. What's going to happen to me? You are a brave girl. What you did was self-defence. It's OK. Stop crying- Let me see you. You are a beautiful girl. Now let's go to bed. We have to go to court first thing in the morning. Get up. Sit down. Go ahead and sleep. In October 1996, while the defendant was walking home from school, the deceased, Tadele Kebede, and six other men abducted her. Then Tadele took her virginity by force the same night. In order to save her life, she shot and killed him. This is the defendant's statement. Your witness, defence counsellor. Your Honour, due to the unusual nature of this case, no one in this community is willing to testify on her behalf. So we ask the court for a 6-month extension to find potential witnesses. Your Honour, the defence knows that no witness will come forward on her behalf because she killed a man in cold blood. The defence is deliberately trying to delay the court proceedings. Only the court can delay or expedite the court proceedings. Therefore, I'm giving you three months. Excuse me. I know you don't like me. But this is not about me. A young girl's life is on the line. You know that no witness is going to come forward for Hirut. The entire village is against her. They want her dead. You know she shot him in self-defence. If you don't have witnesses, I can't help you. All I know is that she shot and killed a man. There is no evidence that shows otherwise. Are you asking me for a favour? Yes, the villagers want her dead. Do you want me to spare her life? She's looking at life in prison. It's your decision. How do you do, ma'am? - How do you do? - Praise God. Where can I find Alemayehu? Do you know each other? Are you related? Oh, no. I just... I'm helping a young girl from the next village and I can't seem to find anyone who wants to help her. Are you the woman that they talk about on the radio? God bless you for what you are doing for the young girl. That's his house. OK. Thank you. You shouldn't go around advertising that you are helping that girl. That would not be useful for you. Excuse me. My name is Meaza Ashenafi and I'm a lawyer. I know who you are. You were there when Tadele abducted Hirut, weren't you? I was. As his best man, it's my job to help him. I know I can't convince you to testify in court. Why are you trying to defend a girl who murdered a man? Because she was trying to defend herself. By taking his rifle and shooting him? She was running away from him to get back to her parents. He was trying to marry her. I know you city people don't approve of our methods, but this is our tradition. But don't you think it's wrong to force a girl to have your children even though she doesn't love you? Men abduct when they fall in love. And Tadele got angry when her family told him that she didn't want him. Even though his family had arranged another wife for him, he didn't want to miss out on Hirut. So, what do you think should happen to Hirut? The only punishment fit for her is death. And that is what will happen to her if she ever comes back. What's taking so long with that wood? I'm sorry, I didn't know that we had a guest. I'll prepare lunch. It's OK. She's just leaving. Thank you for speaking to me. Good morning, Emnet. Sorry I'm late. My car... Mrs Belaynesh, is everything OK? Everything's OK, I'm just here to bring you this. Mrs Belaynesh, you shouldn't have. This isn't necessary. It's OK, it didn't cost me anything. I baked it myself. Thank you. I should be thanking you. Because of you, I've got my husband back. Thank you. Goodbye. I'm in a jam. A young girl lives in my house because they want to kill her in her village. And the police can't protect her. Is this the girl who killed her abductor? Can you help her in your orphanage? You know I can't. She has living parents. We take girls without living parents or relatives. I know that, but this girl cannot go back to her parents. The dead man's family has sworn to kill her. Please, it's just going to be for a little while. She needs to be protected while she's on trial. I'll talk to the board. Thanks. Oh, one more thing. No one should know where she is. As far as I'm concerned, she's still in danger. This is Mrs Elfinesh, the administrator. You know Meaza. - How do you do, Mrs Elfinesh? - Hi, Meaza. I haven't seen you for a while. And this is Hirut Assefa, our newest member. You are a very courageous girl. No need to be shy. We're all friends here. Are you hungry? Meaza is going to join us too. Come. Where did you find her? The police found her as she was running away from home. Amazing! Quiet, please, girls. Please, quiet. This is Hirut Assefa, the newest member of our family. And what do we say to our sister? Welcome to Addis Tessfa, Hirut! Very good! Hirut, do you want to sit with us? Go ahead and eat. Is this a school? Yes, it's a school. But it's our home too. I heard that the villagers exiled Hirut. Is it true? That's why I'm here. I want to ask your advice. I asked the Assistant DA to convince the elders to reverse their decision, but he has refused. I asked the Ministry of Justice to do something about it. They said, "We don't get mixed up with the customary law." So I'm prepared to challenge the Ministry of Justice in the High Court. Well, that's a serious step. You'll have a hard time convincing any judge to take your case. They will be terrified to summon the minister to court. The law needs to be enforced. They can't forbid her to go home to her parents. It's a violation of her freedom. Look, Meaza, these cases are hard to deal with. There's never been a self-defence case awarded to a woman. Remember the recent ruling? A judge ordered a young girl to marry her abductor because she is pregnant with his child, even though neither the girl nor her parents agreed to the marriage. You're right, the law must be enforced. But there are different ways when you're dealing with government officials. It's late, I have to get back to the office. - I can't file this case. - Why? You want to sue the Minister of Justice? You can read, right? No judge will take this case. What's the matter? Why are you crying? What's the matter, honey? Did you have a nightmare? What happened to her? Did she fall down? She didn't fall down, she always sleeps on the floor. What? I want to go home. Please take me home. Poor girl. She misses her mum. It's OK, it's going to be all right. It's OK. Stop crying. - What's wrong, Hirut? - I want to go home. - You know we can't go back yet. - Why not? Because it's dangerous. No. I want to go home. Listen to me, Hirut. I know you miss your parents and your sister. You don't know anything. Why am I here? You say you're helping me, but you're using me for your own good. I know what's going on. I listen to the radio. Hirut, please. This is not like you. I don't want to live here. I want to be with my sister. Yes, but we have to wait until the court date. You can see her there, where we have protection. - You don't understand. - Believe me, I do understand. I found it on her bed. It's from her sister. Her father pulled her out of school. - Hirut! - Aregash! Oh my God, Hirut, is it really you? - Mr Assefa, how are you? - ls everything all right? Yes. - Please come in, Meaza. - OK, thank you. You have grown so much. What's it like in the city? There are too many people. It's loud. The cars, the music. I'm not allowed to leave the orphanage that much. I just go to school and come back. I'd love to come visit you. - Hirut is here. - What did you say? Where? - Speak up, where did you see her? - She came in a car. There's a woman with her. You should be getting back. It's getting late. MrAssefa, can I talk to you for a second? Please don't leave yet. The food is almost ready. It's getting late. Why isn't Aregash going to school? I know you need help at home, but... It would destroy her mother if anything happened to her. Besides, I need someone to watch the cattle. - You have to go back. - Father, please. You must think about your mother, and your sister too. If they know you're here, it's not going to be good for any of us. We have to go. - No! No... No. Aregash! - What is it? Hirut, get down! You can stay with me if you want. It's all my fault. None of this would've happened if I hadn't run away. Aregash would still be in school. None of it is your fault. You know, I was once arrested when I was your age. It's true. It was during the military government time. 13 of us were sent to a resettlement camp to teach. 11 boys and two girls. So, as always, the two of us girls were supposed to cook. I refused. I was there to teach, I thought. Then the girl accused me of not doing my part as a woman, and I was arrested and put in a holding cell for two weeks. How did you get out? They knew I wasn't going to change my mind. So they let me out. They wouldn't have liked my cooking anyway. Why? Because I didn't know how to cook. I still don't. But I didn't tell them that. They wouldn't have believed me. You sure you want to get out here? Yes. Hello, Andinet. Thank you. Yes, I'll tell her. Hello. - Hello Andinet. - What's going on? Thank you for your support. We appreciate that. ANDINET SUES THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE "Andinet Women Lawyers Association, a local non-profit organisation..." Do you believe this? "...that provides free legal aid to women who are victims of violence "sued the Minister of Justice today. "The charges were filed after the ministry refused to overturn "the customary court's decision "to exile 14-year-old Hirut Assefa from her village." - Should I continue? There's more. - Membere, we had to fight back. What do you think the minister is going to do now? We can't risk it all because of one girl. Don't you get it? Hirut is what we've been waiting for. We had a good chance of convincing a judge and getting the decision reversed. But you had to go and sue the Minister of Justice. You know why I stayed here? When I could work for any NGO and make much more than cab fare? - Meaza. - Wait a second. Because I thought I was part of something bigger. I stood by you while being treated like a stepchild by the media and everybody else. I am your partner. My husband stays at home with the kids while I'm here with you. For what? For Andinet or violence against women to have any significance, we must win this case. If that doesn't happen, we're done. Hirut's case can really start something. But this is not just about her. We could lose everything, including our foreign aid money. How are we going to serve those who depend on our services if we can't keep our doors open? This girl killed a man in self-defence. But the court doesn't believe that. The Ministry of Justice, the governing body of civil society and NGOs, has suspended Andinet Women Lawyers Association indefinitely. Excuse me, please. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm OK. Go inside. I'm coming. Hello, Gash Hiruy. They shut down my organisation. They cannot shut me down without a reason. Hirufs court appointment is in a month. Where is Meaza Ashenafi? I'm here to inform you that, due to the suspension of your organisation, you are no longer Hirut's lawyer. That means Hirut is to be placed back in custody of the village police. Where is the girl? - She isn't here. - Then where is she? I don't know. Not here. She isn't here, sir. I will give you a day to bring her to the police station. Don't forget she is in your custody by court order. I don't need to remind you that you are responsible for her whereabouts. Let's go. Next case. Your Honour, the court calls Andinet Women Lawyers Association, case number 217. Andinet Women Lawyers Association versus the Ministry of Justice. - Look, counsellor... - Honourable Court, Andinet Women Lawyers Association wants to be heard in this courtroom. I know that the Minister is not here. But if he were here, what I would want to say to him is that I am... Hirut is not a murderer. Actually, she is a brave girl. We all have a lot to learn from her. Our citizens have a given right to freedom. Yes, including women. Hirut knows her rights. Of course, except for the limitations that are put on her by tradition. I was a judge before I started this organisation. I left the seat because I was convinced that the time had finally come when all citizens of this country, men, women, and children, would be treated equally under the law. I still believe that. The Ministry of Justice illegally shut down our organisation without explanation. And, to date, no charges have been made against us. Your Honour, it is within our rights to sue a civil servant in a court of law. We have done nothing illegal. If I'm at fault, my mistakes shouldn't determine Hirut's fate. Since this organisation is community-based, the people who are really affected by the closure of the office are the poor women and children who otherwise have no legal advice or representation. So, I am asking this court to do what's right. Reinstate our permit and lift the ban on our practice in the legal system. Thank you, your Honour. This court has heard your case. But there will be no judgement made until this court hears from the Ministry of Justice. Next case. We have to turn her in to the police. You've done what you can. Is there anything I can do to buy us time? This is it, Aster. - You again. - May I sit down? Sure. Whatever she's drinking. Thank you. Where did you tell your husband you were going? I said I was going out drinking. Not playing by the books these days, are you? Sorry I left you. You don't have to be sorry. It's all my fault. I'm with you. I thought I would find you here. - How are you? - They fired the Minister of Justice. They say he resigned, but I know he got fired. What? Are you sure? The ministry has reinstated your permit. It'll be all over the news any minute. - What time do you have? - We can make it. Good morning, listeners. Today we are broadcasting from the Central Wllage Regional High Court. We will transmit live the court proceedings and the judges' decision. It is dead quiet here in the courtroom as the three judges walk in. The courtroom is so hushed, you can hear every word being written on a piece of paper. Hirut stands in the defendant's dock. All eyes in the room are on her. Your Honour, we'd like to call a witness. - Mr Gebeyehu Gebru. - Present. Your Honour, this man was not present at the time of the murder. I will allow the witness. Sit down. Do you know the defendant? Yes, I know Hirut. You were at the police station when Hirut was brought in, right? Kill her! She should be hung! So, if you have heard her statement, can you explain to the court what happened after she was taken to the abductor's home? She said she was exhausted by the beating they had given her on the way to his house. And then on the same night, her abductor raped her and took her virginity. I didn't see her doing the killing. I just saw her at the police station while she was making her statement. Are you done? Earlier that day, I saw Tadele and his friends riding their horses. They were carrying a gun, too. Where were they going? They were heading towards the school. You may step down. Defendant, what do you have to say in your defence? I don't think of myself as a murderer. All I did was protect myself. I don't feel sorry for that man. I could have been killed. At the moment, the three judges are talking among themselves. And here is the Head Judge. We have heard the witnesses on both sides and seen the report of the pathologist attached to this case. We found, in the evidence of the defence and the pathologist's report, that the deceased used force to harm the defendant. His actions violated the law. The court understands that the defendant was deprived of the right she has been given by the law to protect herself. The actions you took were the only course you had to defend yourself. So, according to paragraph 74, you will not be convicted for what you did. The court sets you free. Why are you crying, Hirut? We won. I don't feel like I won anything. I can't even protect my little sister. They will get her one day. Can't you see that? I can't save her. Drop me off here, please. - What's wrong, Hirut? - I just want to walk. Stop the car, Samuel. Are you sure you know where you're going? Yes, I know it from here.
