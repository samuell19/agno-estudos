You overslept. My name is Thomas Allcroft, and I have kidnapped you. You will remain captive until you've fallen in love with me. Your name is Ruby Wattz, you are 25 years old. Ruby. You studied law at university. You were born in Dorset. Your mother was a paramedic. Your father was an architect. Excuse me. You're an only child, and you're still afraid of the dark. What have you done to me? I severed your ligaments. Don't move, don't fidget, don't do anything if you ever want to walk again. Your possessions are in there. I have not touched them as they are your private belongings. Two are painkillers and the other is a contraceptive pill. I will bring you food three times a day. Help you wash every other day. If you need to go to the toilet, then I will help you. Do not try to do this yourself as it could cause irreparable damage. Lights on at 7:00 a.m., lights out at 11:00 p.m. And do not try to escape. We're 10 miles from the nearest household, and your legs don't work. Did you rape me? No. The pain will only get worse if you don't take your medication. Please, Ruby. Why are you doing this? Hey, hey! Breakfast is served. You're in pain. You should've told me. Now I have to up the dosage. Open your mouth now. Swallow. Good. Show me. Don't try to get up, you'll only make it worse. Who are you? What have you done to me? My name is Thomas Allcroft, and I have kidnapped you. You will remain captive until you fall in love with me. Your name is Ruby Wattz. You are 25 years old, studied law at university. Your mother was a paramedic and your father was an architect. You are an only child. You're still afraid of the dark. What's happened to my legs? It was a necessary precaution. Couldn't have you running away. They will heal given time. All you need to do is take your medication and rest. Two are painkillers. One is a contraceptive pill that will stop your menstrual cycle. I have no sexual intentions. It's just efficient. Your possessions are in there. I have not touched them as they are your private belongings. I'll bring you food three times a day. Help you wash every other day. If you need to go to the toilet, I will help you. Do not do this yourself as you may cause irreparable damage. Lights on 7:00 a.m., lights off at 11:00 p.m. Do not try to escape. We're miles from the nearest household, and your legs don't work. Did you rape me? Be patient with this type of injury. No moving. Your legs are broken. You cannot walk. Even the idea of standing fills you with excruciating pain. Do not try to move. There is no hope of escape. Your legs are broken. You cannot walk. Even the idea of standing fills you with excruciating pain. Do not try to move. There is no hope of escape. Your legs are broken.

My name is Thomas Allcroft, and I have kidnapped you. You will remain captive until you fall in love with me. Your name is Ruby Wattz. Can I ask you something? Depends on the question. What happens if I don't fall in love with you? Will I stay here for the rest of my life? I mean, it's not very romantic, is it, cutting the back of someone's legs open? I mean, when a girl says she wants a man to sweep her off her feet, I hardly think this is what they have in mind. What can I get for you? - What do you mean? - What do you need? What do you want? - Well... - You're obviously feeling better. You're making jokes. You must be getting bored, so what can I get for you? Well, a pillow and a blanket would be great. Something to read maybe to make the time pass. Hm. I mean, doing nothing isn't exactly healthy, is it? I need to have something to do. You want a book? Yes, please. I should be able to get that for you. Thank you. What do you think of the drawings? Pieces of art, you like 'em? They're okay. Thought I'd brighten the place up. You look well. You look better. Thank you. Tell me again what it was that you wanted. Something to make it more comfortable. Pillow. Blanket, book. Pillow, blanket, book. Pillow, blanket, book. Pillow, blanket. Your book. I read it before. It's your favorite. What's the matter? It's just it's the only thing I've actually remembered since I've been here. I know. It was just so vivid, sorry. That's because the book is a trigger. It's linked to such a strong emotion that it triggers a memory that would otherwise be lost. Any memory that's linked with strong emotion can be restored. All you have to do, find the right trigger. What else could be a trigger? Anything, an image, sound, emotion, smell. Or any combination of them. So I could get my memory back. Well, yes, if you're willing and patient. I can help you. Thank you. Would you like a hot beverage to accompany your meal today? Anything you like, you name it. Anything at all? Anything, whatever you're most thirsting for. Bet you I have it. What about a red bush tea? Oh, fine choice. You know I was gonna choose this, didn't you? It's the only thing you drink. How do you know all this? I've done my research. Don't trust him. It's okay, go ahead. Sorry, I've just been thinking about that book. You have? It's just so good, such a great story. I never saw the ending coming. You finished it already? Ruby, what's the matter? Talk to me, please. How many others, Tom? What? How many others have you kidnapped before me? Ruby, I don't know what you're talking about. Don't lie to me. How many other girls have you done this to? I'm not special, am I? Probably done this dozens of times. And what do you do? See someone on the street that takes your fancy? Start following them, stalking them, researching all about them? Then what? You attack them, snatch them away, lock them down here? Try and trick them into falling in love with you. That's not how love works, Tom, not in the real world. Does it ever work down here? Of course it doesn't. They never fall in love with you, do they? Then what? You beat them, drug them, rape them? Do you ever let them go? Of course not, you're too smart for that. You can't have your evidence scurrying away. You kill them, you chop up their bodies, burn them, bury them, hide them in the walls. You don't want me to fall in love with you. You just want anyone. Sorry. Don't know where you got this ridiculous idea from. I wouldn't want you to have done this for someone else. This is special. There is no one else, just you, Ruby. It's still healing, needs more time, okay? One last thing, Miss Wattz. Can we have a candle? You want a candle? To change the mood. It would be romantic. I think we should forget about last time. Have a clean slate. Yeah, I know you're only trying to help me. I was just overthinking, got confused. I should have given you more things to stimulate you. You can go mad in this blank space all day. Well, I'll get you another book after lunch. I keep having this reoccurring dream. Yes, what about? I'm unconscious underwater, sinking down and down. Sounds more like a nightmare. No, it's weirdly peaceful, serene even. And then this figure appears. He's going to rescue me. He pushes me up towards the surface, and then I... You wake up. We're making progress, aren't we? Yeah, I think. Water. You should start with Carroll first. You'll enjoy that one. - That's it. - Ow. That's it. Tom, can we stop please? You're doing great. You're nearly there, nearly there. Did you ever notice that picture above the sink's a bit wonky? Oh yeah. Don't worry, I just thought I'd say. Don't worry, I'll fix it. Everything okay? I'm good, how are you? I thought we could try walking again before dinner. Sure. Hm. Have a rest. If we keep making progress like this, maybe we could be eating upstairs soon. Voila. It looks good. Yeah? I like it. Thank you. Why all this effort? It's a very special meal. How so? Just try it. You enjoying it? Mm. Good. This is really nice. It's the only restaurant in Dorset that does this. It's your favorite. It's gorgeous. How's your salmon? It's crispy skin with quite a succulent center, brandished with herbs. I read this somewhere. And well it's got high notes of lemon and thyme and well there's quite a hot chili after burn. Woo. I was just going to say this salmon is both exquisitely rich and wonderfully tender. So much vitality, it positively quivers on the tongue with flavors so vigorous it's simply bound to excite an woman to the point of crisis. It is orgasmic. Shh, shh. I'm not with you. Give our compliments to the chef. Right away, sir. Shh. What? I got you something. Really, you shouldn't have. Close your eyes. Lift up your hair. I remember. It was so vivid, it was like I was actually there. Wow, I could see and taste my meal just as clearly as I can right now. It's called a flashbulb memory. In this case, the trigger is the meal. It's linked to such a strong emotion in your mind, it can trigger an extremely vivid memory. I was with you once, wasn't I? We were together. It was our anniversary meal. This is my favorite chapter I think. Yeah, it's the primrose chapter, isn't it? That was always your favorite. You were inseparable from that book. I was envious of it. - Really? - Uh huh. I wanted to discard it, throw it away, burn it. I remember when you first read it. You read this piece out to me, and it was the worst reading I had ever heard. It did nothing for me. But I always listened tentatively. And it was around that same time we first started to ride our bikes together. The summer when you moved in next door, you'd be out on your bike almost every day riding up and down the cloughs, and every day I would wait by my bedroom window just to see you. Then I would come out on my bike and act like it was all some big coincidence. I don't know if you knew, but if you did, you never let on. It's cold out there. You'd need a coat, Ruby. I can't sleep. Ruby, I have to say this or I'm always going to regret it. Ever since I met you, ever since we were little, all I've wanted to do is spend time with you. Recently... Recently, I've come to realize that it's more than that to me. I love you, Rubes, I always have done. I know you've had boyfriends and I know there's lots of important stuff coming up, going to different universities, but I really, really want to spend the rest of my life with you. You're so funny, you're so smart, you're caring. Truth is I care for you more than anyone. I don't know what to say. I love you too. You do? I feel the same way, and I want that too. We really were together, weren't we? Everything is real, all of it. Are you starting to believe me? I'm starting to believe myself. I remember, we loved each other. This one controls the lights and the brightness, and this one controls the music. I know this one. You picked the song, what's the matter? We're just having some fun. We're just having fun, it's okay. What? Will you tell me something? Anything, Ruby. How did we come to this? It started a long time ago now. One weekend, I was coming to visit you. How come we never happened? What? How come we've never happened? What? You know, we've always had this thing. Oh, the thing where you get drunk and embarrass yourself. That thing. Yeah, that thing. You were waiting ahead with your flatmate, Nick. Yes, we are going to the same house. - Pot of gold, pot of gold. - No, this is... - Pot of gold. - No. No, no, no. It's, I love him. So I'm trying to call you, and I hope you're okay and having a nice evening. Anyway, Rob has been a life-saver, and he's driving me over now, so I'll see you soon. Okay, bye. - Nick. - Come on. - Come on. - Get off. What are you doing? Get off me, you're drunk. - Shoosh, shoosh. - Stop it. Stop, you're hurting me. - Come on. - Get off me, please. Nick, Nick, listen to me. - No, no, no! - Yes. No, no! If she don't let you in again, I'll still spoon you. Appreciate it. Die! I killed him. I didn't know what to do. What the fuck have you just done, man? Oh, shit, shit, shit! I can't believe you just dragged me into this! We just fucking... Rob, be fucking quiet! No, don't you fucking dare! Don't tell me what to do! Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Yeah, hello, yeah, I need an ambulance. Yeah, no, it's fucking urgent. I need you to get here right away. No, no, no, I can't... No, no, no, no, put it down. - What... - Shh, shh. - What are you fucking doing? - Shh. You'll wake her up. I don't give a shit, we need to get some help. What are you doing, man, huh? She's not responding. I don't give a shit, we need some fuckin' help. Listen to what I'm saying. Okay, tell me. My Ruby is not responding to me. Okay, so why don't we get her some help? Why don't you wake up and why don't we get her some help? I should've been there. It was my fault. Rob drove us as far north as he could. After that, we were on our own. You'll be okay now. If you need anything, please just call. Don't come and find us. Thank you. I took you as far away as possible. I started rowing the boat and took you to a tiny island with an abandoned farm. Who are you? Who are you? I don't know you. Please don't hurt me. It's me. It's Tom, it's your Tom. Please, no. Let me out! You can't keep me in here! Let me out, please! Please! You can't keep me here! Please, no! I had to believe I could save you. I learned everything I could about your condition, retrograde amnesia. You'd lost all memory of your life before the attack, and you had difficulty forming new memories. I soon learned if you slept too long, your memory would reset to how you were immediately after the attack. Look what I found. Didn't think I brought it, I did. Look, it's us at the prom. It's us, look. It's you in your red dress, and there's me. It's your prom night. It's me. I learned how it was possible to trigger memories. I've read it before. I found a way to control your sleep so you could learn for more than just one day. Progress was slow. I had to try and find new ways to help you remember who you were. So especially significant emotional memories are stored in different parts of the brain. Not the hippopotamus thing, that's damaged. The hippocampus, exactly. So that means that they should all be retrievable. So all we need to do is just find the correct trigger. I tried all sorts of scenarios. Can you describe him? - Who? - The man who attacked you. Facial characteristics, appearance, height. - I don't know. - Learning more and more each time. Good morning, Miss Wattz. How was your first night in the clinic? Going to play you a song, so close your eyes and relax. Until finally I felt confident I could fix you. I was ready to help you remember us. I needed a scenario to buy me time and allow me to slowly gain your trust. A blank canvas, something I could control which would allow me to introduce triggers when you were ready. Your brain told you I was the villain. Your legs are broken. You cannot walk. So I played my part. Now I've finally fixed you. Finally. I love you so much, Ruby. So much. I love you too. No, no, no, no! Ruby. Well, we have been in a bit of an incident, haven't we? You'll be very pleased to know that the surgery was a complete success, and you'll make a full recovery very soon. Due to the nature of your injury, though, you have suffered some short-term memory loss. But don't worry, I give you my full assurance that it'll call come flooding back. I'll let your boyfriend know that you've come around. When you wake up.
