You cheated, you know. The Duel Arena has very clear rules. No magic. It's not cheating if you win. It's only cheating if you get caught. - Shall we go another round? - No, we don't have time. Sparring with you is the only part of the day I enjoy anymore. I enjoy it too, but we're needed. It's one of the downsides of overseeing the most important school ever built. And I'm bored. Rafal, what do you want? Just one more round. Ugh. We'll both use our magic. No holds barred. Come on, Rhian. Show me how it's done. You just don't stop... Rafal, that's enough! Maybe for you, but I'm done settling for half. I want it all! No! Rafal, what have you done? That's… Blood magic. I've been searching for years, but last night, I finally found it. Rafal, it's forbidden for a reason. It'll consume you. You can't control it. I prefer chaos. Thousands of years, you always gave the heroes the upper hand! I held the balance with you. It's my turn now. Rafal… I dictate the terms. And it's going to be a very different world. We can work together. Evil doesn't cooperate. Evil doesn't share. When I'm done… …Evil won't lose. No! Oh, Rafal. Once upon a time, there lived a girl named Sophie. A brave creature of exquisite beauty and uncommon grace… …who was destined to change the world. Now, listen up for the last time, you lazy, ridiculous girl. Get your candied ass out of bed now! Sophie, I know you can hear me! Someone save me. Okay, I'm awake. Don't break the door down. I will, if you're not out in five minutes. And no spending an hour on your hair. At least I have hair. All right, settle down, now, boys. Good morning, my dear family. Hey, don't waste that tomato, Sophie! It was supposed to go in the stew! You've got to be kidding me. Meanwhile, on the other side of Gavaldon, just outside of town, in a humble cottage on top of Graves Hill… …there lived a girl named Agatha. Dang it. You're too good at staring contests, Reaper. Come here a minute, Aggie? I'm making Great-Grandma's love potion for the widow Grunfeld. It needs something. - Hemlock. - Of course. Agatha had no idea if her mother was actually a witch since her potions never worked. But it was in Agatha that her mother placed her highest hopes, knowing that her daughter had the makings of a real witch. A sentiment shared by Agatha's peers. Witch! Witch! Witch! - Burn her! Burn her! - Witch! Witch! Hello there, my little forest friends. Weirdos! Freaks! God, I hate this town. Fortunately, they had each other. A friendship between two such different girls might have seemed unlikely, but theirs was a special bond… Oh, gross! …forged at an early age. For it was the death of Sophie's mother, the person who loved her most… Always remember how special you are. You're gonna change the world someday. Then you'll live happily ever after. …that brought her a friend who loved her even more. - Who's there? - I… I made this for you. I'm sorry about your mom. And it was beneath the village wishing tree that they sealed a bond they knew would last a lifetime. Like, for literally the hundredth time, no. It wouldn't have to be a whole makeover. We could just do a cucumber eye mask. Maybe a pumice scrub for your pores. Hey, ugly. Aren't you gonna answer him? Not her, you. - Oh. - Eric says you put a hex on him. Who's Eric? - We've been in the same class eight years. - He says you looked at him weird. And now he's feeling all itchy. I'm sorry, that sounds more like a hygiene issue. Seriously. Lice, anyone? Hey, shut up! You two think you're better than us, but really, you're just a prig and a pig. Freaks. And I'm Eric. You know, I think he likes you. Who, Eric? I'm sorry, there's an Eric? Oh, I… I need to pick up some hemlock from Mrs. Fisher for my mom. I gotta get some green fringe anyway. - I'll meet you at Deauville's. - Wait, no, Sophie, I… Okay. Uh… Cool. Witch. She's a witch. Hi. Hello there, little guy. Aw, yeah, you like that? You're the girl lives in the graveyard. We live by the graveyard, yeah. Mm. You know, everyone… …and I mean everyone… says you're a witch. You know what we used to do… what we used to do to witches in Gavaldon? We burned 'em. - You have a really nice day, buddy. - Whoa! We don't want witches in this town. Do you hear me? It's a threat to the decent people of Gavaldon. You know, I seriously doubt there are any decent people in Gavaldon. - You okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Let's… Let's get out of here. Hey, let's drop by Deauville's, see if she's got anything new. Oh, don't you have to get home, though? C'mon. Let's see if she's got something good. Ah! My favorite readers. Good thing you stopped by. We had a big delivery yesterday. - Any ghost stories? - Yes, a few interesting-looking ones. Any new fairy tales? Nothing you haven't read a thousand times before, Sophie. But I did spot some very interesting older editions in there. Look, look! Dig around. Okay, this might sound crazy, but you ever think about branching out of your comfort zone? Maybe, like, stop reading little kids' books? Aww. To The Blood of the Homunculus? I'm good, thanks. Give me Cinderella any day. - Just look at the dresses in here. - Ah. You found it. Just look at the embossing. Who's S.G.E.? Not who, what. The School for Good and Evil. Don't tell me you've never heard of it. - Where is it? - No one knows. Another time, another world. But legend has it, it's where the true story behind every great fairy tale begins. - Ooh. - The School for Good trains the heroes. The School for Evil, the villains. - Or so they say. - The people in insane asylums, you mean. I wouldn't be so sure of that. Twenty years ago, a girl named Leon or a was taken from our village under a blood-red sky. Many believe the school wanted her for some reason. What happened to her? No one knows. She was never heard from again. That'd be one way to get out of this town. Do they ever accept new students? You're joking, right? Yeah. Dear School for Good and Evil. As a future princess, I wish very much to attend your esteemed institution. Allow me to list the many attributes that I believe make me a uniquely qualified candidate. From a very young age, I've always known it's been my destiny to change the world. Willing to try anything to escape her current life… Please be real. …Sophie entrusted all her hopes for the future to the powers of the Wishing Tree. - Oh, I hate my stepmother! - Whoa, whoa. What? There's an opening at the factory, so she's making me quit school to bring in more money. So I will quit too. Can she get me a job there with you? And then what? We just fade into this town like everyone else? No, Aggie. My mom said I'm supposed to do something important. Something that matters. So, I'm leaving tonight. Wait, Sophie… you've never even set foot outside Gavaldon. You don't even know what's out there. - None of us really do. - That's the point. You know nothing can ever happen for me as long as I'm stuck here. I can't settle for an ordinary life. I won't. Hey, look. - Remember? - Oh! - Yeah, I found it in my attic last week. - Oh! See? You already did do something that matters. The day you became my friend. Please, I can't handle this place without you. I'll talk to your mom and dad, and I'll tell them how unfair this is. I'll call you Queen Sophie of Gavaldon. I will even let you give me a makeover. Just please don't go. - Okay. - You promise? I promise. - Oh, thank you! - Oh! "Queen Sophie of Gavaldon." It was at that moment Sophie decided she was beyond wishing for her life to magically improve. It was time to take charge of her destiny. Even if it meant breaking the promise she'd made to her best and only friend. I'm so sorry, Aggie. But some wishes are simply too powerful to take back. You were gonna run away after all? Aggie, I'm sorry. What was that? The red sky. It's happening. Sophie. Hey, we have to get out of here. - Aggie, this is what I wished for. - You what? Sophie! Sophie! Hold on! I'm coming! So long, Gavaldon! Farewell, mediocrity! Goodbye, low ambition! Aggie, no! Please let me go! No way! I'm never letting you go! No. No. No, Aggie, what was happening was a good thing. I'm sorry, Sophie, but I… I couldn't take that chance. I can't let anything bad happen to you. Yeah, I know. Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Aggie, this is good. No, no, no, no! This is not good! It's okay! This is it! This is real! I was right! Aggie, look. That must be the School for Good. It's so beautiful. Wait, that means that's... Oh God, the other one. Aggie, this is everything I've ever wanted. This is not what I wanted! No, Sophie, we have to get back. You know my mom can't get by without me. I'm sure this will take you home once it drops me at the Good school. I want it to take us both back! Oh, Aggie! No! You're supposed to drop me at the Good school, not her! No, take me back! Please! No! You don't understand! I'm Good... Ah, great. The bird ate my shirt. Oh wow. Can I touch your hair? Most witches don't have princess hair. I bet it smells like cake. I love cake. - I'm not a witch! - Hey! Hey, where are you going? Oh, come on! Help me! Fall in line, newbie. Get over there. Oh! - Sorry. - Watch it, freak. Hey, no! You have to listen to me. I am not supposed to be here. I'm Good! God, I hate move-in day. I'm supposed to be a princess, not a villain! No! Ow. Did she just kill a fairy? Uh, what? Oh. Ah. - Son of a... - Oh dear. You must be lost. Yeah. Yeah, that is an understatement. How do I get out of here? I… Ugh. What the hell is it? It looks like a witch. I'm thinking a troll. I say demon. Maybe part hunchback? I don't have a hunch. Then you really need a tailor. How do I get over to that school? I knew from its smell. It's a Never. Just listen! I just need to find my friend. Ah, whatever, the fairies will get rid of her. Come, girls. - Mm. - What? I'm leaving. No, no, no. I need... Stop doing that! What are you…? No, let me go! Get off of me! Ta-da! Me again. Put her there. It's cleaner than my own hand. Trust me. - I'm Hort, by the way. - Hort? That sounds like something you cough up. That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. Weirdo. Excuse me, ma'am. You seem to be in charge, and I am in the wrong school. Ooh! How distressful. And improbable. Back up. Your name? Actually, you know what? I wanna guess it. You won't know it. Mm, Sophie. Of Gavaldon. Did I guess it? - I always do. - There must be a mistake. - I clear... - You're the Reader. - I read, if that's what you mean. - Shh, shh, shh. It's not. Every so often, a very lucky candidate from the outside is selected for admission to this hallowed institution. We call them… Readers because they only get to read about the amazing adventures that originate here. Now, please, excuse me. I have fresh villainy to attend to. Showtime! Attention! Attention, future Evil! If you open your tiny little bloodshot eyes, you'll find your dormitory and class schedules around the hall. It would serve you well to memorize both. Make me proud. Oh my God. Don't you ever touch me again. All right! Okay. I thought fairies were supposed to be nice. Oh, I must be in hell. Ugh. Well, this is hell, all right. What…? - Holy sh... - Well, hello. I see you found the Groom Room. Well done, Agatha of Gavaldon. Might I suggest you clean up a bit before orientation? Or perhaps clean up a lot. How do you know my name? Because I've been expecting you. I am Professor Dovey, here to help however I can. Finally. My friend Sophie wanted to be here. - The Never? No. - The what? Your friend is a Never. You are an Ever. Ever, because we believe in living happily ever after. Nevers, because they don't. School for Evil, School for Good. - Evil... - Yup, okay, I got it. - But clearly, there's been a mistake. - Hmm? I mean, look at me. My dear, one doesn't measure one's goodness just by how one looks. No, it's about what one does. If you're here, you must have great… power. Trust me, I don't. Well then, I bet you just need to learn to summon it. Feel it. Because magic follows emotion. The stronger the emotion, the more powerful the magic. Summon enough passion, and you can accomplish anything. For you. - How did you do that? - I just told you. - Okay. - Yes. Thank you so much for the show. Um, have fun with your magic tricks, lady. I've gotta find my friend and get back to Gavaldon. Stop! Look, if there was a mistake, then it is one that someone is going to get fired for. Literally. So, let's pretend there is not a mistake until we can sort this all out, yes? Besides, there is no way back. Wait, what? Oh, I know! Let's get you in your armor. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, yes! Look at them! Let me guess. You're not a pink person? Not a problem! We also have rose, fuchsia, blush, watermelon, hibiscus. So many colors! I just love my job. - Wait, Sophie! - Aggie! - Hey! - Hey! They gave you a gown? Sit down and shut up, Reader! Wait. Come on. Okay. And stay there! Hey. Me again. Oh my God. Excuse me. My father tells me not to talk to Readers. He says they're bad luck. You've probably read about my father. Captain Hook? He's got a pretty awesome ship. Do you want a bite? It's nice and putrid. Grace and beauty first? - Oh, if you insist, Clarissa. - So glad you agree. Welcome, first-year students! I am Professor Dovey, Dean of the School for Good. Evers! Evers! Evers! Evers! Evers! And I'm Lady Lesso, Dean of the School for Evil. Kill you! Kill you! Kill you! Kill you! Kill you! - There's no boys in the School for Good? - Ugh, there's plenty. And get ready to be nauseous. As per tradition, the winning school from last year… Us again. Imagine that! - Hmm. Imagine. - …will now grace us all with a display of their chivalrous talents. - Ugh. - Gentlemen! What a bunch of losers. Oh my. Aren't they wonderful? Oh. If you boys are finished with dance class, maybe you'd like to have a real fight. Oh no. What do you say? Who… is… that? It's Tedros! His dad was king, so of course he has to have his own stupid entrance. You know what? Let's make it easy for you. Charge! Yes! I don't know what the big deal about owning a round table is, anyway. His father was King Arthur? - Yawn. - Wow. Nice work, fellas. Let's see how you do in a real fight, pretty boy. Prepare to die. Get him! Get him! - Huh? - Mm. Oh, come on. If we're gonna do this, we might as well do it right. Ugh. Yes, yes, yes! Oh, come on! Foul! Anybody! He's got a magical sword. How's that fair? That's Excalibur. Really? I know. How evil of me. Come on! Dammit. Oh, how good of you to lose again. Bravo! Bravo! A heroic display! Look... Uh… - Excuse me, milady. I believe, uh... - That I don't belong here? Yeah, I know. Don't want your stupid rose anyway. Oh, and by the way, this is what a normal girl looks like. He intended it for me. Normal girl. There's an open seat next to me, Teddy. And, for the record, you don't know what I was about to say, but… Nice try. What did he smell like? Ego. In these two schools, we will take away any confusion and make your souls as pure as possible. Pure Good. Or pure Evil. Future heroes and villains, you have been chosen to protect and maintain the balance between Good and Evil. For if that balance is ever compromised... I don't think we need to get into that just now with our new friends, do we? It's such a happy first day. Let's not be downers, hmm? Besides, I'm sure this new class will perform exceptionally well. And like your parents before you, you are all here because the world of story needs great heroes and villains to teach the people of the outside world to make choices to find their way. So, obey the rules, study hard, and remember, the Storian only chooses the very best of our students for their own adventure. But what if we've been dropped in the wrong school? Or there's been a mistake and we need to go home immediately? There are no mistakes in the School for Good and Evil, so… Have a nice semester. All students, report to your assigned sleeping quarters. Perfect. The Good do not room with Evil. - Reena… - Hmm? Tell the fairies to come get my bags. I'm moving. Mm, but I'll miss you so. Try not to ruin anything. Sweet dreams, Never. Hey! No, no, no! No, you don't understand! I need to find my friend! Whoa. Ugh, I told you we'd get her. Let me guess. It's Belle. Or Anastasia. Or Sugar Plum. Actually, my name is Sophie. - Ah! - You two have no manners. Welcome to room 66. I'm Dot, daughter of Robert de Rainault. - Robert… - Hello? The Sheriff of Nottingham. It's okay. He's not, like, super famous. Yeah, who's ever heard of Robin Hood? Learn your history, cream puff. Anyway, that's Anadil. And that ray of sunshine is Hester. You can bunk next to me, Sophie. That's a funny name for a villain. Oh, please. - She's so not a villain. - Of course I'm not. Look at me. Do I look like a witch? Or a troll? Or some disgusting old hag? That hag is my mother. Okay, eyes up, Agatha. It's just a Cupid, stupid. Okay, don't be lame. Don't be lame. You got this. Phew. Okay. Okay. Oh. Uh, hi. Students aren't allowed on the ledge. Prepare for punishment! And I thought Gavaldon was bad. All right, princess. What's so important we had to trek all the way up here? I'm in heels, you know. It's the Readers. And their insistence that they shouldn't be where they are. And something does feel wrong. The only thing that feels wrong is the School Master's decision to bring them here in the first place. What if he did make a mistake? What if he dropped them in the wrong schools and something terrible happens? He'd never admit it. He'd blame one of us to save face, and you know what would happen then. There is no mistake. Besides, I'd think you'd be happy. I'm stuck with yet another underachiever. Sophie of Gavaldon. What? What? No. Whatever do you mean? Pfft. Please. Evil hasn't won anything in over 200 years. Well, you've come close a couple of times. Close doesn't cut it! Ugh! I just have to work my students twice as hard. Mm. Because a world where Evil is not as powerful as Good is a world out of balance. Now, if you'll excuse me… …I have a lot of work to do. Lesso! Stay away from Sophie, little witch. She has a destiny to fulfill. And she belongs to me now. Where are you, Sophie? I'm sure your mother's beautiful on the inside. I have to get to the other school. - I'm Good. - Yeah, at disguising your Evil. I am not Evil. Let's settle this with science. Oh my... If she's Good, the fairies will catch her when she falls. But if she smashes on the rocks in a gruesome, skull-splintering death, she's Evil. The second one. Do the second one. But she is a villain. She just doesn't know it yet. No, I'm Good! Aw, she whines like an Ever. Smells like an Ever. Has hair like an Ever. Or had. Hey! Not the hair! You want proof that I'm Good? Then get a mirror, and look in it. You hag! Told ya. Definitely Evil. - Sophie! - Aggie! Aggie, hey. - Come on. - Wait, where are we going? To get you out of here. - Oh, good. - Not good. Some… thing is after you. I saw it. Okay. So we're ending this now. Aggie, no! It's not worth it! - Come on. - Agatha's plan was simple. Find the School Master and plead their case to leave the school directly to him. There was only one problem. How do we get in? He definitely came up here. I saw it. Hey! Let us in! Great. Now we're stuck up here. Would they be prepared for what awaited them in the shadows? Agatha called into the darkness. Hello? But there was no response. Who is that? Sophie discovered that books lined the walls, filled with stories from every corner of the world. You know we hear you narrating, weirdo. If you're trying to scare us, it's not working. The girls heard a scratching in the blackness. They moved warily toward it. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. All of that, and it's a dumb pen? Sophie, stop! Don't touch! You know, no students have ever made it into my tower. I knew you were special. The Storian began writing your story before you even arrived. Guess that's why I'm so confused as to why the two of you want to leave. She wants to leave. I don't. Sophie, I have to get you out of here. Ahem. Ladies, ladies. I can assure you, you are both perfectly safe here. We pride ourselves on protecting our Readers. Really? Then what about the spinning tower of blood I just saw obsessing over Sophie? Well, my friend, you see, there are so many random spirits and personalized spells flying around this school, even I can't keep up. Well, I think she's in danger. So, unfortunately, we can't just languish here while you train us to be in some silly fairy tales. Our graduates live the very real events that change the world, which become the stories that change the world. You're trying to tell me that Snow White and Cinderella and Jack and the Beanstalk were real? As were Hercules and Sinbad and El Cid and all the others who have battled the forces of Evil. We teach you how to fulfill your destiny. And that's exactly what I wanna learn, but you put me in the wrong school. I'm supposed to be in Good. You made a mistake. - Hmm. - Sir. Well, perhaps I have. But I'll need you to prove it. Why, if it's your mistake? Because once something is written by the Storian, only the Storian can change its course. This is ridiculous. How are we supposed to change its mind, if it even has one? Oh, but it does. And there's only one way, really. What is the one thing that Evil can never have that Good can never do without? Oh, I know. Manners. A castle. Amazing hair. A horse. Mm. True love. Which is traditionally manifested in a kiss. So you're saying… I can't believe I'm actually saying this. If Sophie were to kiss her true love, that would prove to Quilly over there that you were wrong about us? If one from School of Evil won true love's kiss, it would change everything. And I could stay and switch schools? Sophie. This is all I've ever wanted, Aggie. I can't go back to Gavaldon. Not to my old life. I will never get this chance again. Please, let me do this. - I'll think about it. - Excellent. Well, I guess somebody better go find herself a prince to kiss. But remember, dear Reader, no kiss comes without its price. Wait, what does that mean? Good morning, darlings! Rise and shine! The first event of the semester, the Evers Ball, is only two weeks away, and you've got a lot to learn. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning, Agatha. Wake up, despicables! Psst. Who's that? - Dark… Dark hair. - Tristan. I caught his rose. I hope he invites me to the Evers Ball. You have to get a boy to ask you, or you fail. And you do not want to fail. Three fails, and you're expelled. - Wait, you mean they kick you out? - Uh… No. They actually turn you into something else. Like a talking tea kettle or a mouse or something much worse. Wait, like forever? What? Uglify! Why do we need to be ugly? Hort! Wake up! Oh, because it makes little children cry. Wrong. That's merely a bonus. Ah. Why be revolting and repugnant? My question exactly. Ah, not caring how you look forces you to use your intelligence. Ugliness is freedom! My tooth just fell out. It's disgusting. And I don't care. And that is power! Bring it down, girls. I am Professor Anemone, and I am here to show you how to become a truly powerful woman through beauty. A lady's smile is a sword in the battle for life and for true love. So, pick up your mirrors… …and strike! - Lovely, Reena. - Thank you, Professor. Exquisite, Beatrix. I'm sorry. This just feels so wrong. Smiling? That's how you're empowering us? Smiling is a strict requirement for passing this course. So, show me your smile if you don't want to fail. My… smile? Mm-hmm. - I don't feel safe. - Mm-hmm. Wait. What is that? A fail, Reader. Wait, you're… you're failing me for being a bad smiler? Yeah. Let's get to work. Ah, now, prepare to drink up and see how ugly and powerful you can be. Reader. You're first. No. I don't want to be ugly. It's not who I am. Not yet. Hort! Uh, yes, sir, Professor Manley. Sorry about this. But don't worry. You'll still look beautiful to me. It's, um, Agatha, right? - Hi. - Do you mind if I sit with you? - No. - Great. - If you want to. - Uh… I'm Gregor. Um, Gregor Charming. The, uh… the prince's son. I'll try not to be too charming. - I'm Agatha. - I heard you don't want to be here. Well, I don't either. - You don't? - I'm not cut out to be a prince. It's… It's not who I am. Do you know what I'd rather do? Run my own grocery store. - Wait, really? - Yeah. I love food, but I wouldn't sell meat 'cause I can't stand the sight of blood. That's actually why I got a fail today. I got nicked in a duel. I'm sorry, they failed you for one tiny cut? Not quite. I saw the blood, and I passed out in my heavy armor. I was on top of a hill, and so I started rolling down, knocking over everyone in my path. Definitely grocery-store material, right? I think you should do whatever makes you happiest, Gregor. I'm sorry, Gregor, will… will you excuse me? Oh, uh… Sure. See you around, Agatha. Thanks. - Did you get attacked? - Yes. By tadpoles. In ugly class. Well, I failed beauty class. What part did you fail? Smiling. Smiling? Forget it. I found you a prince to kiss. I already found my true love. Tedros. We had a connection from the moment we saw each other. Plus, we just make sense, aesthetically. Well, unfortunately, Beatrix already has him. You think she's prettier than me? I'm just saying we need someone who's available now. School Master said it had to be true love's kiss. Sophie, a kiss is a kiss. Oh, really? Oh. See? Nothing happened. Has to be true love. I'm okay to keep this casual. Aren't you sweet? Just give him this, and tell him how good and kind I am. Oh! And don't be weird. You know what I mean. Don't talk about your cat. - Fine. - Fine. Just get him interested. I'll handle the rest. Get off me! Who are you? I am the Gnome of the Blue Forest. But I thought gnomes were supposed to be short. I thought princesses were supposed to be likable. Welcome, students! Gather round. I need you all to sign in so I know who survived and who hasn't. Hey. Normal girl. How's the mind reading coming along? Uh… Oh. Yeah. No. Sorry about that. That was… I was just really overwhelmed when I first got here. - Yeah. This place can be overwhelming. - Mm. Never had a princess cop an attitude like that before, though. Really is quite impressive. Mm, do they usually all smile and bat their eyes at you? Yes, they do, which is incredibly boring, so thank you for not being boring. Uh, no, I'm actually, uh, pretty boring. The only person who doesn't think so is my cat. Mm, no, I… Well, they say, uh, cats are good judges of character. - They do? - They will. Now that I've said it. I'm quite famous here, you know. Number one fairy-tale prince and all. Yeah, I think… I think when you become king, they're probably gonna have to find a bigger crown to fit on that swelled head of yours. Um… Nice. Nice. Uh… Um… This is for you. - Yeah? - Not from me. From my friend, Sophie. Oh, the… the witch with the gorgeous hair? No, no. She's not a witch. She was just dropped in the wrong school. No, that does not happen, normal girl. She's definitely playing you. Well, in this case, it did. Trust me. She is… definitely a princess. My name is Agatha, by the way. Agatha. Much better. 'Cause you're definitely not normal. In a good way. All right, come on, everybody! Come on, gather round. Let's can the balloon juice. Hmm? I am Yuba, the school woods survival expert. I've lived in them for hundreds of years, and I haven't died once. At least… …not that I can remember. Oh! That's just a little gnome humor. So, off we jolly well go. All right, let's get these doors open. Go on. Open! Open. Open the forest doors! Thank you. Follow me, everybody! You cannot survive any adventure if you cannot survive the woods. The Blue Forest prepares students for any perils you may face. Hey. Oh, uh… Hi. Gregor, what happened to your forehead? I failed, uh, steed-riding this morning. Gregor! Turns out I'm not really any good with horses. And I think I might need glasses. That grocery store's looking better and better, right? Stay away from Tedros, you goon. He's mine. Oops. Hey there. Come on! A field of pretty pansies, but as we know from our fairy tales, pretty can sometimes kill you. No, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! Cheeky plant. That's, uh… That's one bouquet you wouldn't want to catch at a wedding. Gnome humor. Right. It's okay, Gregor. It can't get you. You're fine. I really hate this place. Quick, quick! Come on.
