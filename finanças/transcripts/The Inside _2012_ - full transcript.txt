DJ ON RADIO: Absolutely loving that tune. I still haven't had a chance to see the guys play live, so next time they hit the Dublin city center, I have to make sure and do that I'm hearing good reports all around. It's Jenny Huston with you for the next hour and a half or so, slightly brain-dead Jenny Huston, but still, we've got loads of good music to keep us company. Um, sit back and relax, we've got loads of good music coming up for the next hour and a half, 80 minutes or so and if you're heading out on the town, do be careful. I don't know if you heard the story. Three girls were reported missing in Dublin city center five days ago which is kind of creepy. And they still have not been found, so do be careful if you're heading out there and stick with your buddies stick together. And if you're staying in, stay listening. Got a great one up next. DJ: A message just came in on the shoutbox which I'll read to you as I do that. Okay... Uh, it says, a girl is driving down the road she sees a pram in the middle of the road so she gets out of the car goes to the pram, but there is no baby in it so she gets back into the car and starts driving and a van is flashing lights behind her, so she's getting scared, he starts flashing lights and she drives faster. The van's still flashing lights. She rings her friend and says, "There is a van behind me, can I come to your house?" So, she pulls into her friend's place and the van's still behind her, she gets out of the car and the van driver gets out, and as the van driver gets out, another guy gets out of the back seat of her car, and runs off into the woods and the van driver was flashing lights trying to let her know that there was a guy who had got into in the back of her car, when she pulled over to go to the pram. Is this is a true story or an urban myth? I don't know. It's creepy. How much you give us for the ring? I'll give you 50 euro. It's worth four times that, man. Give us 100, 100 and something. Give us something. Tell you what, I'll give you 75 with that camera. -A camera? -Yeah, camera. Came in yesterday. -All right. -All right.
