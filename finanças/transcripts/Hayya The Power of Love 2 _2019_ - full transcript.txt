Ki Zainal once told me. Hijrah is a marathon. You know for sure when to move your feet quickly to leave the start line. In the middle of it, you can be tired, desperate, and want to stop. But you know right there, at the finish line... ...there are victories and blessings awaiting. Hijrah always needs patience and sacrifice. And in many times, I'm the one who has to make a sacrifice. I got trouble again because of my best friend... ...who said that he's trying to do Hijrah, but still burdens me. I swear I'm not a criminal. Not a robber, communist, terrorist... ...or whatever it is that's probably in your mind right now. Okay, to avoid misunderstanding, let's go back a few minutes before this. Oh, my God! There's a bearded man!/ Oh, my God! I'm dead! What are you doing here? How dare you come into our house? You want to steal? What have I done? Entering the monster's lair. How dare you!/ What an insult! Attack him! Let me go! Hey!/ Whose kid is that?/ Whose kid is that? He's a thief. A pedophile. Kidnapper! Chase him!/ A kidnapper! How can those three mucus say that I'm a kidnapper? I'm a real man who upholds the values of Pancasila, religion, and romanticism. Wait for me! I'm baffled by them. Born perfect as men, but they want to be women. This country should bring them around and give back their masculinity. Don't let them be. I hope they are enlightened. Crazy she males! Damn you! Thief!/ I'm in a bad luck today. Actually the problem started 2 months ago. You still remember my best friend? That's right. 100 points for you. Rahmat Ashraff Abdurrahman. Yes, the most annoying and self-centered person I know. But, thank God, this past year, he has changed a lot. Rahmat is more religious than before. He used to be a Muslim only as an identity. Now, he acts like a real Muslim. He's even more active in humanitarian organizations. Doing social activity, helping people in need. I have presents for you. Come closer. Don't fight over them. I'm happy to see Rahmat becomes a good person. But I still can't accept... ...seeing Yasna fall in love with Rahmat. I just can't accept it. He wins big. The point is Rahmat becomes a much better person now. Rahmat once said this to me. My sins are bad. They're uncountable. My wickedness. What I wrote... ...what I said, my action all this time about Islam... ...is wrong. I feel like... ...I spread my face with my own shit. Look at this. They dedicate themself for humanity in Palestine. The Story of Indonesian Volunteers in Palestine Me? Here? Sometimes I... I don't know. I'm dizzy with my sins. There's something wrong with Rahmat's head. And as I had guessed, he ask me to go to this place. Palestine. The land of the prophets. We both become volunteers and journalists... ...who capture the latest condition in Palestine. I don't know when the Palestine conflict will end. But I'm sure there's a silver lining in every misfortune. That's what I hear from Ki Zaenal's lecture. And don't stop praying for them... ...and helps to relieve the burden of our brothers in Palestine. I doubted Rahmat's purpose to come here. It turns out that he's really sincere. I didn't expect Rahmat, that was radical, now is a romantic. Allah is greater! ...in Palestine once said this. "We will not sell Al Aqsa. We won't surrender Baitul Maqdis. And we won't leave Palestine!" - Say Takbeer! - Allah is greater! Yes, sir, here comes Rahmat. Rahmat, your father. How can you not call him for a month, since you're here? Hello. Peace be unto you, father. Yasna. She must have been stepping on a frog. Yes, father./ How can she wants to be with this baldy? If you don't marry her soon, I'll snatch her. Put that away! Father./ For Heaven's sake, Rahmat. Do you forget that you still have a parent? Sorry, the signal here isn't good. I'm barely in the camp tent. How are you? Thank God, I'm good now. I was sick thinking of you. Rahmat, remember... ...you'll get married in a month. Are you serious about this? About getting married? If you're not serious, let me give her to someone else. I have many followers who want her. Don't do that. I'm serious. I will go back home to Jakarta soon. Besides, I'm the one who's getting married, why are you the one who is rushing? You want to get married too?/ You insubordinate kid! You talk without thinking. No one can replace your mother in my heart. Do you understand?/ Yes, I do. Relax. You can get a heart attack. Just relax, father. How is she anyway? - Why are you asking? - Why? I'm her soon-to-be husband. Then go home, Rahmat. Marry her immediately! Yes, of course. Send my regards to her. If God permits. God be with you./ And with you too. Hey! Hayya, I'm coming back to Indonesia tomorrow. Yes, Hayya, all of us will go back to Indonesia. Everyone will go? When? Tomorrow morning, all of us will go to Turkey... ...then go home with a ship. Don't go! Hayya will miss you. Don't go, uncle. I don't want to lose you! Relax, Hayya. Uncle Rahmat will come back here... ...to meet you, if God permits. Goodbye. Come on. If God permits us, we'll come back here. Two weeks later The kid you saved, all of her family is killed. Hayya? Hey. Hayya, how did you come here? So, you sneaked into the suitcase? It was a long journey. This is your room. Thank you./ You're welcome. You want to stay here? Hayya, I don't have girl's clothing. I think this suits for you. She's already wearing a shirt. Ouch! You make the mustache tilted! You disturb me making art. Din, do you see something in your suitcase? What something? Something. A living creature. A living creature? Let me tell you. If you have your underwear in my suitcase, that's something. Something weird. You're asking a living creature. None! Your soon-to-be wife is asking for you. She's been calling me non-stop. Hello, peace be unto you, Yasna. Unto you, too. You forget. Forget? Of course not. How can I forget? In two weeks, if God permits. Then why haven't you send the photo? Photo? I have the ring already. I've bought it. But if you send me the photo, I can see the model. It's a surprise. Just relax, be patient, I'll send it. Okay then. When will you come home to Ciamis? If God permits, soon. As soon as I finish my work, I'll go there. Okay then. Be careful, take care of your health. Okay, you too. If God permits. Peace be unto you./ And unto you, too. Hey!/ What? Come with me./ I'm doing some work here. Just come with me. Bring your bag. Hurry. Come on. Mat. What are we doing here? Yasna ask you to buy these for the orphanage kids? Hey! What are these for? I'll pay with a debit card./ Okay. Please hurry up. What's wrong with you? Thank you./ You're welcome. He's going crazy again. Hey, where are you going? Hey, where are you going? Don't ask too much. Help me buy a ring, then meet me at home. A ring for who? Why can't you think? Of course not for my father. He's becoming more and more incomprehensible. I buy a ring? For his father? Peace be unto you. Mat? Peace be unto you too. What are you doing?/ You can come in. Just lower your voice. Don't be noisy. Don't ask too much./ But not like this. My head is going to be flat. I'm too handsome to be flat-headed. This house is a total mess! It's like a shipwreck. Are you in a depression? Because you're asked to marry Yasna immediately? Oh, God. What is this? Kid's clothes everywhere. Mat... ...if you're not ready to get married... ...I'm ready to replace you. I'll make Yasna happy. Shut up!/ What's wrong? There's a kid here./ A kid? Who? Your kid? Your niece or nephew? You don't have a kid nor any niece or nephew. Whose kid is it? Hurry, tell me. It's hard, I don't know how to tell you./ Just tell me. Don't say anything weird. You didn't kidnap someone's kid, right? You're not a pedophile, right? Hey, talk wisely. Ask for God's forgiveness. You ask me to be quiet, but you don't give any explanation. Where's the kid? I'll show you, but don't be noisy. Keep your mouth shut. Okay? Come with me. I'll show you. You're crazy. How can she be here? You kidnap her? I don't kidnap her./ You don't, but you take her. If you keep on talking, how can I explain it to you? You can't do that. I know you care for Hayya. You told me you want to adopt her. But you take her. You're crazy. I don't kidnap her, I don't take her. She came herself. Hey, she's a kid. How can she come here all the way from Palestine? And alone? Mat, do you realize you're breaking the law of two countries? You want to spend the rest of your Hijrah journey in prison? She sneaked into my suitcase./ Into your suitcase? Hey, crazy man, the journey to Indonesia isn't short, especially with a ship. If you say she went into your suitcase, how did she survive? I don't know. Before this becomes more complicated, we have to tell Mr. Yusuf immediately. Convince him that you're innocent. Okay? Here, sir. Thanks. Peace be unto you./ And unto you too. Peace be unto you. You want to add something else? No. It's 65.000 rupiah. You give me 100.000 rupiah. I give you back 35.000 rupiah. This is your grocery. Thank you. I hope you'll shop here again. Peace be unto you. And unto you too. Thank you. Anto! Hello?/ Mat, where are you? I have arrived. I'm arriving soon, Din. You're still at home, aren't you?/ I'll be there soon./ Liar. I have to take care of Hayya first./ In the last two days... ...Gaza Strip is in a bad situation./ Hurry up. Ustad Yusuf is awaiting. Wait for me. I'll be there soon./ Hurry up. Don't be long. Israel military keep on doing airborne attacks on Gaza. The attack is causing many houses and buildings destroyed. And caused seven people died./ What's wrong? It's only on TV. Relax, Hayya. You're safe here with me. Peace be unto you./ And unto you too. Sorry I'm late./ Please sit. It's okay. Relax. I was talking with Adin. I asked him when he'll end his state of being single. Just look at him. He's at the right age, he's settled. But his reason... He said, "Let Rahmat marry first, because his condition is very concerned." "Dry and dark." Is that so?/ Yes, I feel sorry for him. Adin is different. It's not that nobody wants him. He has this disturbance./ Disturbance?/ A little abnormality. Disorientation. He doesn't like female./ Oh, God./ His mouth... God forbid! God forbid. You know that Prophet Adam was created first, then put in heaven. Heaven is so nice, all things good are put there. But he was still contemplative. Because he had no partner. When Siti Hawa was created, he was happy. That was in heaven. You're in this world, not in heaven. In your boarding house, a lot of women to choose from. Why aren't you getting married? You're single all the time. How can that be? Listen to him. Let's go back to our business. What is it? Well... We want to discuss the kid we found in Palestine. That kid is now.../ How is she? Which kid?/ Wait. The kid in that refugee camp, right? Yes. How is she? It's about that. Thank God. If God permits, everyone is safe. There's always a bomb threat there. That's why we have to keep on praying. If God permits, with our prayers, they will all be safe. There's another good news. Thank God we've finished building our emergency school there. That's not what I mean. What we're here for is actually to tell you that we... We miss them. If God permits, if we have the chance, if it's possible... ...if it's permitted, we want to join you again there... ...although we can't help much, at least we can cheer them up. Thank God. I'm happy to hear that. If there's a departure soon, I'll contact you. Mat, hey. What are you doing? Why do you want to go back there? If you don't care for yourself, at least think of your father. And Yasna, who has been waiting for you. You're not only not solving the problem, you're adding it. You know the consequences if you don't report it? You can be considered human trafficking being. Prison, Mat. So, what do I do? You go back there. Explain to Mr. Yusuf how Hayya arrived in your house. Then let that be their problem, to return Hayya to her hometown. You never experience living alone, having nobody... ...in an unsafe place, being insecure. I experienced that for 10 years. I felt like I was banished from normal life. This kid... She has no one. Just because she's watching TV... ...and listen to a firecracker, she can scream hysterically. What does that mean? She's in trauma. She needs a safe, comfortable, and calm place to live, just like you. So what do we do? I'm confused. We have to give her a calm and comfortable place, a normal life. And nobody needs to know her whereabout./ Wait. We? You're crazy! Hayya's friend. Mother. Father. Independent, integrity, and trusted. These three points have to be our ideals and principals... ...in carrying our job as a journalist. Do you understand? Any question? Then, please continue your job. I don't think you can take care of her alone. You have to work, cover stories, come home late at night. So, what do I have to do? I'll ask my friend to help you... ...finding someone to take care of Hayya. Don't do that. There'll be more people who know about her. Don't worry. Trust me. I'll ask them to come. All you have to do is choose. Agree? I'll be waiting tomorrow. Okay. To the address I gave you. Okay. Okay. You're ready, Mat?/ Ready for what? For an audition./ Audition? That's right. Come in! My name's Rini. People call me Inces Rini. I'm from Tasik that's cool and beautiful. Like that. Have you ever take care of a child? I have. I took care of a neighbour's child and his father. His mother was always working. So, I took care of them both. What a irresponsible mother. But remember, I'm not a husband stealer. Thank you./ Okay. Riana? Riana? Miss Riana? Please come in. Oh, God! Go away! What a coward. Enough. I give up. Peace be unto you. Peace be unto you too. Before we start the day, it's better that we thank God... ...for the blessing that Allah gives to us. For the health, the fortune, and all the bounty that we enjoy. Excuse me, Mama... Contemplate my words. A child is something that is entrusted to us. We have to take care of them and educate them as best as we could. A lot of parents want their kid to be pious. But they themself aren't pious. They're working non-stop, enslaved by the world. Excuse me, what's your name? You're giving a lecture without telling your name beforehand. Sorry. My name is Adeh. I am called Mama Adeh. Mark my words, you youngsters. Okay. Excuse me. What we're looking for is a woman. So, what are you doing here? Oh, no. I think you're in the wrong house. I am a woman. I'm just trapped in a male body. Oh, God! I feel smothered. Your brain is fried, your ideas are all bad. Wait. There's one more. If God permits, this one is good. I promise. Forget it. Damn you. I don't want to do it anymore!/ Wait! Please come in. Peace be unto you./ Peace be unto you too. Thank you for inviting me here. Why do you have Melayu accent? Where do you come from? I lived in Selangor for a long time. So, during all that time, my mother lived in Indonesia. She worked as a house maid. But... Miss... What's wrong? It's okay. I always get carried away when I remember about it. If you can't bear it, you don't have to continue. It's okay. So, since I was a kid until I became an adult... ...me and my mom lived on our neighbouring country. Then my mom married someone from the country. I also fell in love with someone there. But... ...he betrayed me. He left me before our wedding. Then my mom fell sick. But I had to go to work. I was ashamed. But all I know is... ...the man... ...is like you! With long, thick, curly hair. Like a vocalist of a Melayu band. Like a rock band vocalist! I can't be sad like this. Miss... Calm yourself. Calm down. Okay. We're touched by your story. But right now, we need... ...a babysitter for our kid. What? The kid of you both? Oh, God!/ Not like that. Not my kid, but his. What? He's... Oh, God. You can take care of a kid, right? When I was in KL, I helped my mother... ...babysitting for a family there. Okay. So, you have a special skill? Can I sing? Of course. Please. Stop right there. Enough. Din, you take care of her. Oh, God! How pretty! Who are you? Who is this? How pretty you are. Oh, God! Beautiful. Hayya./ What's your name?/ Okay then. You're beautiful./ Hayya. You're awake. Let's take a shower. Let's take a shower, honey./ Pretty. What's her name? Okay. You're accepted as the babysitter. Oh, God! Please go back to your seat. Calm down. Sorry./ You're really enthusiastic. But we haven't know each other yet. What's your name? I forget. My name is Ria Yunita. Okay, Miss Ria.../ No. Just call me... Ricis. Just call me Ricis./ What is Ricis? It's an acronym. Beautiful and sweet Ria. Oh, God! Peace be unto you. Peace be unto you too. Sir./ Come in./ Okay. So, Ricis, basically, your job is to take care of Hayya. Okay? There's a room on the back. If you want to, you can rest there and take Hayya with you. My room is upstairs. That's my privacy area. You can't go upstairs. Okay? Clean Hayya, guard her, wash her clothes, and prepare her food. You don't have to go out. I've prepared the food ingredients. All of them are in the fridge. One more thing, Hayya can't speak Indonesian language. Oh, God./ To communicate with her, you have to use body language. Sir, if I may know, where does she come from? The Palestine./ Palestine? Oh, God! She was born there?/ Yes. Okay. In the meantime, you can stay here. I go to work at 8 am every morning and come home at about 9 pm. Okay? So, take good care of her. Is there any question? Sir, can I go out of the house? You can, but you can't go out of the complex. There's a park here. You can bring Hayya there. But don't go out of this housing complex. Okay? Sir, can I bring someone here? Who?/ My relative. You have any relative in Jakarta?/ No. I mean, a friend. A friend?/ Yes./ No. No relative, no friend, no one. You can't bring anyone. You just follow my order. Sir, can I ask one more question? What? So that I'm not confused if the neighbours ask me about Hayya, is she your child? Yes, she is./ You said that she's from the Palestine, that she was born there. Her mother is also from there. I don't know what to do if the neighbours speak badly about you and Hayya. Just don't respond. Hayya. Bye. I'm dizzy thinking about this. It's so quiet at this time of the day, not many people. I don't know what to do. Ma'am! Peace be unto you./ And unto you too. Where are you going?/ I'm going home. My name is Ricis. I'm your new neighbour. As neighbours, we have to know one another. Hayya, come here. Hayya is a Palestine kid. His father is a single parent. Isn't she pretty? It's delicious. Me again? Okay. Only five thousand rupiah. I want this one./ I'm taking this one. I've been working for Mr. Rahmat for three days. But I still don't know where her wife is. Is she in Palestine? Or Turkey? I don't know. It makes me dizzy. It tickles! Mr. Rahmat, Mr. Adin. I'm curious. Where's Hayya's mother? Is she going to come? Mr. Rahmat, whose kid is she? Just tell me. I can keep a secret. Your secrets will be.../ If you say one more word, I'll fire you. How sensitive. Hayya, I'm bored. Do you want to accompany me walking around the complex? Hayya. Do you want to? Come on! Happy Independence Day, Indonesia How festive this is. Who is he? How handsome he is. I have to know him. Oh, God! Who is this kid? Hayya! Oh, God. Where's Hayya? Hayya! Hayya? Hayya? Hayya? Hayya? Oh, God! Hayya? Hello? Peace be unto you. I'm sorry, sir./ What's wrong? You can cut my salary for a month, but forgive me. Just calm down. What's wrong? Hayya is missing./ What? What do you mean "missing"?/ I took her to walk around the complex. I held her hand. But suddenly, she's missing. I told you not to take her outside. I've warned you!/ I'm sorry. What's wrong?/ Where did she go missing? In the complex of the house, not far. This is the result of your doing, incompetent! Hey! What if she's really missing? Ricis is a jerk. You go there, I'm going there. Excuse me, do you see a little girl, about this tall? Her hair.../ No, I don't. You don't?/ No./ Okay. My daughter! I'll lift you. You've been playing?/ Yes. There./ There? That little hand... ...holds a stone Her eyes... ...are teary The feeling of yearning Running across sadness Bullet rain... ...fall Through it all A mistaken Don't know where... ...to take shelter Mother! Hayya! We should return her to her country. Maybe she misses her home. What home? Her home is ruined by the savage of the Zionist. She has no home. Her home is right here, with me. She's safe. How is she safe? She was just running away. If it wasn't for us, she would have been kidnapped. Jakarta isn't safe for her anymore. I'll be more attentive at her. I'll spend my time for her. I'll resign from my job if I need to. Resign? What's wrong with your head? Maybe this is Allah's way for me for what? For me to learn to take care of a kid... ...so that she doesn't go through what I went through as a kid. Alone, abandoned. But you can't do that. She's not your child. From now on, she's my child. From now on. You're stubborn. It's really hard to talk to you. Peace be unto you./ And unto you too. Come in./ Okay. A Palestine kid was missing with the departure of Hubbu Team. Here's her photo./ It's her photo? Her name is Hayya. We're asked to do an investigation... ...to all team members who left Palestine. It'll be a major setback to the international humanity program... ...if this is connected to human trafficking. Yes. This is serious. What's wrong, Din? Mr. Yusuf called me this morning. He said that one of the kid from the Palestine camp is missing. He asks for Wildan and the police's help to know the kid's whereabout. What now? Hayya's not safe here anymore. We have to go now./ What? So, Hayya's not your child? You kidnapped her from the Palestine? Oh, God! I'm dead. You want to kidnap me, too? Shut up. Nobody wants to kidnap you. And we're not a kidnapper. So, whose kid is Hayya? I'll explain later. We have to go now./ Come on, let's go./ Let's go./ Hayya. Lift her. Hurry. Come on, Hayya. Be careful. Mat, where are we going?/ My father's house. In the name of Allah. Ricis./ Yes, sir./ You stay here with Hayya. Peace be unto you./ And unto you too./ The one we're waiting for is here. Thank God. Peace be unto you./ And unto you too. Your beard is getting thicker./ Because of the rain season. Please take a sit./ Yes, thank you. Oh, God. Yasna, come here. Take a seat. Thank God our children have gathered here. Thank God./ So, there's nothing else that we have to wait. It's better that we start this. Start what?/ Shut up. You'll keep on running away if it isn't like this. But what is this?/ In the name of Allah. Thank you to Mr. Somad and family... ...that'll be my in-laws in a few moment. If God permits it. So, thank God... ...what we will do, the marriage of our children... ...has already been settled by the parents, the date and the time. If I'm not wrong... ...it'll be on August the 25th... ...that'll be on a Sunday. Thank God. What is this? Why didn't you tell me? The sooner the better./ Right./ Father! Father? Hayya. Come with Mother. Mother? What is this? Why does she say "father" and "mother"? Sorry, everybody. Come on. Who is that? Why did she say "father" and "mother"? Don't embarrass me. That's the thing. I want to tell you that I have.../ What have you done? You've been married secretly? Oh, God, Rahmat. How could you do this to Yasna? Oh, God./ Father?/ Mat!/ Oh, God, Father. Here. The upper body first. Straighten his body. Hold it here. Wait, Din. Push him to that side. Like that. Support his body with this so he won't fall. Thank God that it's only a misunderstanding. Yasna has already understand. I pray for you that all will be good until the day. I'm going. Peace be unto you./ And unto you, too. Mat, I want to apologize. I'm sorry that I accuse you of bad things. But if you hurt Yasna, I'll pinch you. I also want to apologize. I didn't expect your heart to be this gentle. That's right./ I also want to adopt an orphan one day. Oh, if you have a female friend from the Palestine, introduce me to her./ Hey! Abrar, finish your school first./ I'm just kidding./ Come on. Rahmat, we're going. Peace be unto you./ And unto you, too. We're going. Peace be unto you. How can you say that?/ I'll introduce you if I know someone. We're going./ Thank you./ Okay. Peace be unto you./ And unto you, too. Be careful, sir. Father, wake up. Everybody has already come home. What an impudent kid!/ Ouch! You shame me! You've been engaged with a girl here, yet you have a kid out there. Villagers will talk about me./ Just let him go. What?/ Just keep on doing that. Don't think bad things. Hayya is not my child. She's an orphan from the Palestine. She went into my suitcase herself and came to Indonesia. She can't come back, she's traumatized. The best thing for her is to be with me here. I don't believe you. Use my room. I'll sleep on the back. Who? Me?/ Hayya! Peace be unto you./ And unto you, too. Oh, dear. Hey!/ Oh, God. You're bothering. I am seeing a grace, but a disaster come. Oh, dear./ I'm dizzy./ You talk without thinking. Why do you come here in this rain? I have something to give to Rahmat from Auntie Nurul. Let me take it./ Oh, dear! If you need any help, don't hesitate to ask me. If God permits it, I can help you. Okay? What are you talking about? My name is Ricis, single and trusted. I'm Abrar, single in the cause of Allah. What's wrong with you two? Okay, then. I'm going. Send my regards to Rahmat. Okay./ Peace be unto you./ And unto you, too./ And unto you, too. How handsome. Oh, God!/ Flirty! Disaster everywhere! It makes me dizzy! Who have pug nose? Me. Brother, can I help you? It's okay, let me do it myself./ It's okay. Let me help a little. They're done in a moment. I can grill, too. Grill the past. We'll eat together, okay?/ If God permits it. I'm already hungry. The grill is hot./ It's okay. How cute is Hayya. Yes, she's so cute. Just look at her. I hope that if we have a kid, she'll be as cute and pretty as Hayya. "We." I'm sorry. What I mean is I want to have a child as cute and pretty as Hayya. Of course, if God permits it. If the mother is pretty, her child must be pretty too. What are you talking about? You said you got the ring. May I see it? You may. Wait a second. Wait. Kids, make a circle. Make a circle. Like that./ What are you doing? I want to make a surprise, like in romantic movies. What are you doing? I'm embarrassed./ Excuse me. Din, the ring. The ring. All right. Yasna... ...will you marry me? Why is the stone so big? It suits your father more. A big stone? Mat. That's why you don't do extravagant things. If you love her, you don't need a ring. The important thing is your heart and promises that are always kept. That's right./ But... You think Yasna is a shaman that you give her a big stone like that? Why don't you give her a boulder instead? Weird guy. Rahmat. This makes me dizzy./ What? My fault? A Palestine kid who is a conflict victim... ...is missing with the departure of a humanitarian volunteer team... ...who left Palestine on July the 20th, 2018. Palestine police authority suspects the kid was smuggled out by one of the volunteer. Hayya? The Middle-East government has already asserted... ...that the children victim of conflict can't be adopted. What happens now, I'm responsible for this, it's not our team doing. We'll help the police to solve this. To the perpetrator, if you don't have any intention to kidnap her... ...please surrender and give back the kid to avoid this becomes more complicated... ...because they'll get multiple indictments in Indonesia and in the Palestine. Brother Rahmat. Brother Rahmat, how could you lie to me? What lie?/ Hayya. Aren't you tired of trouble? Stop lying to me. The news of Hayyah's disappearance is on TV. Why do you do all this? You must know that that's kidnapping and it can send you to prison. Do you realize that? Yasna, here's the truth. I never have any intention to kidnap anyone. And I'm not a kidnapper. What happened was she followed me. Then why didn't you report it? It would free you from punishment. Yasna... All my life, I've been a jerk to my family and my religion. That doesn't mean you can do an extreme thing that break the laws like this. Hayya is traumatized. She needs a safe place. What should I do? Should I abandon her? Ignore her? I consider this as a way from Allah to redeem my past sins. Everyone wants to change, to be useful and do good things to others. If Hayya's case needs me to sacrifice myself, I'll accept it. Please cover this. Don't tell anyone. We need to save Hayya. Sorry, but this time, I agree with Brother Rahmat. We need to protect Hayya. Oh, God. Peace be unto you./ And unto you, too. Rahmat, I got information from the Quran recitation group from the city... ...that a bunch of guys are looking for you. I think you shouldn't go anywhere right now, because you're getting married in 3 days. Hello?/ Rahmat, where are you? I know you're with the kid./ What kid? Don't pretend you don't understand. I know everything. If you have good intention, I promise to help you cleared from all accusation. She needs a safe place. She's safe with me. You're educated. You understand the law. If you don't cooperate, the police will deal with all of this. I'm not afraid of anybody nor the risk. You understand? Why do you become this extreme? I want to ask for your help. Don't let anyone knows that Hayya and me are here. I want to go out to check the surrounding area. Where's Hayya? Hayya?/ Hayya? She was here. I think she's in the back. Father. Father, where's Hayya? She's going to Yasna's house with Ricis. I can't trust anyone! Your English is so good. Who taught you? Mr. Rahmat. Every night, he sings that song. When you meet Father Rahmat, don't forget to sing it. Hayya! Don't be harsh like that. Hey, Yasna. You should've helped me. They're in Ciamis now. If anyone knows that Hayya is here with me, I can lose her. She's just a kid. Remember, your intention is to protect her. So, make her feel comfortable. Sir! Sister. Sir! Ricis, I've told you not to bring Hayya outside. I don't understand what you're thinking. You can't even get simple order. Sorry, Sir. "Sorry." All you can say is sorry. You remember what happened the last time when you took Hayya out of the house? She was almost missing. Please calm down. Take pity on Hayya./ Shut up! Oh, God. Hayya, you have to help me so we can always be together. I'm sorry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Come here. I don't mean to scold you. Come here. Do what you want./ Mat, calm yourself. She's just a kid. How can I be calm? Wildan and the police is in Ciamis. If people tell me that I'm here with her, what I do all this time will be wasted. How can I be calm?/ Nothing is wasted, Rahmat. Every good intention will be rewarded by Allah. We all love Hayya. And if you love her, return her for her own good. What's best for Hayya is for her to be with me. That's the best. Din, take care of Hayya at home. How can you say that? So, I don't come to your wedding? If she comes to my wedding, she'll be seen by many people. That's dangerous for me and Hayya. Okay? Please. Mat, hurry. Come on. Come out, Mat! Rahmat! Rahmat! Rahmat! They're here. Just go out from the back. I'll obstruct them. Come on. Is Rahmat here? He's sleeping. Do you want to wait?/ We can't. Wake him up now. The police want to meet him. Wake him up. I don't dare waking him up./ Be careful./ Wake him up now. Ouch! What's that?/ Nothing. Oh, God. They're running away./ Let's split up./ Go to the back. Rahmat Ashraf Abdurrahman... ...I marry you with my daughter... ...Yasna Nurhasanah binti Somad... Kidnapper! Kidnapper! ...with dowries of 12 grams of gold and a set of praying equipment. I accept the marriage with Yasna Nurhasanah binti Somad... ...with those dowries. How was it, witness?/ Legitimate./ How was it?/ Legitimate. Thank God. Kidnapper! You go there./ Okay./ I go here. Wait, Adin! Let me go. Enough, Din. Give Hayya to us. Enough!/ Hand over Hayya. Just give her or you'll deal with the police./ Hayya! Enough. Sir, Hayya. Rahmat! Din, where's Hayya?/ Sorry. I've tried. I trusted Hayya to you and now she's missing. Damn you! I've protected her the best I could! I've done everything for you! What's wrong with you two? Enough! I know you're incompetent!/ Enough! I'm fed up with you!/ You never appreciate me. If I knew it'll be like this, I should've told them from the start. So, you're the one who told them our whereabouts? Enough! I'm the one who told them that you're here. If you want to, hit me! Don't hit Brother Adin! Do you realize that you're endangering Hayya and the people you love? Is this what you call love? This isn't love, this is an obsession. You're obsessed to be a good person who loves and be loved normally. But this is not normal! You'll never know who really love you if you only think of yourself. It's not us who betray you, you're the one who betray us. You only think of yourself. I apologize and I hope this becomes a lesson to us. Thank you, and I also apologize. Although I'm disappointed at Rahmat for what he did... ...I try to tell the truth to the police that Rahmat isn't a kidnapper. He only tried to be a good person. But his obsession made him make a wrong move. Where's Hayya? You have to let her go. To love is not to force yourself. You really have to learn to let go... ...and willing to be left and leave for the people we love. I'm sorry. Yasna./ Yes? I'm sorry./ Yes. Where's Adin? You're good? I'm good. Your head is the one who is not good. I'm sorry, Din. That's Rahmat. Despite that, he's still my best friend. Thanks, Hayya, you had brought colours in our life, especially Rahmat's... ...although destiny takes you away. Keep on smiling, Hayya... ...for your smile strengthen us to keep on taking care of Palestine together. UNICEF stated that there were more than 1000 Palestinian children... ...wounded in Gaza (CNN Indonesia - 2018) Israel captured 1467 Palestinian children in 2017, 1063 children in 2018... ...and 118 children in the first two months in 2019. Within 18 years (2000-2018)... ...Israel has captured and tortured 16000 Palestinian children. (Mina News - 2019) "Indonesia will keep standing out against Israeli invasion... ...until Palestinian gains its independence." (President Sukarno - 1962) "In every prayer and support, there are thousands of smiles and hopes." (Aman Palestin) Thank you. Thank you for the prayers and supports for Palestinians.
