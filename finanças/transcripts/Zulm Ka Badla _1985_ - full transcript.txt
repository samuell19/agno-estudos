Your friend Mr. Colonel has called up. - Oh, Really? - It must be from the front. You've still not changed. He hasn't called up from front. He has come here on special duty. Ok? How is sister? And children? - Give. - Yes, Just a minute. Hi! Cornel, tell me. What's happening? You people in the police just keep whistling. The actual job we do in military. Yes, okay. Don't praise so much.

And will also meet sister in law and children. My son has gone to the school. But never mind, he too will come back by that time. Tell him to bring sister and Anil too. - Your sister in law is saying... - Yes, I understood. I'll come with my entire staff. Well prepared. Mummy, I'll wait for Anil outside. - But he'll take a long to come. - Let her go, Savitri. - Ok, fine. Go. - Go! - Savitri. - Yes.

Cornel sir, even we don't know this so much in detail. From where did you gather this information? Very naughty man. Take this brother. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [WHIPLASHES] Let go off him. Please let go off him. COLONEL'S WIFE: Why are you beating him? Please let go off him. No! Please don't beat him. Let go off him. [GUN SHOTS] No! What happened, Geeta? Brother, they have killed mummy and daddy. What? Run, Geeta! [WATER SPLASHING] He has drowned. C'mon, let's go. Come. [PANTING] - Boy is drowned in the river. - And girl is also not found. - Girl is also not found. - Now you too go and hide. Where's the girl? [HACKING] [HACKING] My god! What happened, my child? Geeta? Geeta? That incidence has affected her mind greatly. It'd be better if she forgets all this. Otherwise... - Otherwise? - Just a minute! Whenever she'll remember all this. The case will be very critical. Oh my god! But what's the treatment? There's only one treatment. And that's love. Your loving atmosphere. I think this is the only medicine. I see... - Thank you, doctor. - All the best. DIG: I won't differentiate Geeta and Anil in their brought up. [GUNSHOT] No! No! - What happened, my child? - I saw a nightmare. Nightmare? My child nightmares are never true. They are never true. Okay? Very good! Now go to sleep. Good girl! Very good! Sir, cornel and his wife's dead bodies are found from the burnt house. Only Geeta can tell us about the criminals. But doctor has strictly warned me not to ask... ...anything to Geeta about this incidence. But, sir. We don't have any other clue for enquiry. But I can't gambler Geeta's life for this enquiry. - You do something. Search for Cornel's son Bunty. - Ok. He must know something about these criminals. C'mon, walk straight. Go inside. Go... - Greetings, father. - Hey you... - Your mother had come to me. - What are you saying? Who's this boy? I found him at the seashore he was unconscious. So I brought him here. He has forgotten everything. Good! He can be very useful for us. - What's his name? - Sir, he has also forgotten his name. Very good! [HACKING] - Come here. And what's your name? - Shankar! Good! So we name him Shambhu from today. Shambhu! [GUNSHOT] [SHRIEKING] No! Again that dangerous nightmare. Why it's harassing me? Why it comes again and again? Daddy! Daddy! Daddy, I've got the appointment letter. Very good! Congratulations. I'm proud of you, my son. - I'm proud of you. - Thanks daddy. May god gives success and progress to my son. - Bless me, mummy! - You just keep watching. He'll become DIG in five years. - But where you're posted? - Yes, Dharavi. Dharavi? It's a dangerous place. Especially one local goon over there is very dangerous. - Who's he? - Shambhu. Shambhu! You? Good that you've come on wheel chair. I've brought it for you... ...so that you won't have any problem to go to the hospital. I went to jail for six months just to save you. I accepted the crime. And you've forgotten your promise? What promise? I didn't give any promise. Why do you waste time? An innocent girl remained unmarried because of you. Albert uncle died without treatment because of you. You don't worry. You won't die without treatment. - Good morning, Mr. Rana. - Shut up! Kalu, give me 10000 rupees. 5000 is my due. And 5000 is the fees for come here. RANA: Count it. They are exactly 10000 rupees. - Who are you? - I'm the boss of this dishonest man. But honesty is my first principle. Henceforth you'll replace Kalu. Work will be mine. And rate will be yours. Tell me do you agree? Ok. Agreed. You just don't worry, aunty. Everything will be fine. - Long live, my child! - Ok. Who are you? Shambhu, when did you come from jail? I've come today only. But it seems you're planning to send me back. Please help me, Shambhu. Police is after me. - Police? - Yes. They keep following. C'mon. Go inside. What's the matter? - You're practising for parade? - We're following a girl. Very strange! If a boy follow a girl you people locks him in. Now where to send you when you're following? She has pick pocketed in presence of me. Where has she gone? The person who belongs to the purse will not... ...give you anything more. And you're unnecessarily following her. This is our duty. Listen! Why this is shaking? There's a hen inside. [IMITATING HEN SOUND] Hen? When will you cook it? By now she must have been cooked. [LAUGHING] - When will you eat? - Shut up. You better do your duty being in your limit. Ok? And you can give your speech here. - I can hear you from here. - Now listen! Shambhu has come back to the colony. He'll take care of it. Then you too listen to something very clearly. Now a new inspector has come to this area. He's very strict. More than me. I've seen many big inspectors. He also will be a guest here. Go and tell him when Shambhu has come. Only my order will work in this colony now. Shambhu's dare? - Yes, it's done. - Use your hands more and lips less. - Well done. - What? Why have you stopped? Ching Kong? I've pain above. Why your hands are going down? What's the matter? Why your hands have become so soft? Message it with force. It's so dry. Take some oil. Well done! Wow! That's nice. [SIGHING] I feel I must kiss your hands. Why are you pressing it like a cat? Beejali? What are you doing? Leave me. Today this lightening will fall on you. What are you doing? Leave me. No, I won't. You keep going to jail and I long for you here. Today you've come in my trap. Somebody will see you. Leave me. God if somebody will see. I wish some priest see us. So that we get marry soon. [POLICE SIREN WAILING] Police?! Shambhu! Come out, Shambhu! - Rascal! I'm so unfortunate! - ANIL: Shambhu! Come out. Whenever I'm near to my goal police interferes. Shambhu. Why are you hiding? Come out. Why are you shouting so much, inspector? If you'll yell so much then the Lord Shiva also... ...will come out from the temple. Oh, so you're Shmabhu. I've heard a lot about you. I'm just an ordinary man. God is spread everywhere. What do you want, sir? The same that a charmer will have with a snake. But at least tell me who is snake and who's charmer? I've come to tell you the same. I've been posted in this area. And I hate ruffians. I've come to alert you. I also alert you, sir. Take your transfer soon. It's for your betterment. Shut up! I've seen many thugs like you. Don't call me thug. This is my colony. Even the cat becomes a lion in her area. And even the cowardly becomes brave in this police uniform. So you're so much of proud about yourself? Wait! Now I'm not in a uniform. Shall we test who's braver? Why are you inviting enmity with your youthfulness? Are you trying to challenge a lion? Get up! You call yourself a lion? C'mon. Let's go to the police station. C'mon. Carefully. Geeta, what are you doing here? Mr. Anil, is this the way to do the duty? The police station is here and inspector is missing? I'll complain to uncle about this. Also tell him that I had gone to the colony to teach lesson to Shambhu. - Shambhu? - Yes. There he's. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Your hand is bleeding. - What are you looking at? - Nothing, sister. I felt this is a Rakhi that a sister has tied to a brother. You know I don't have a sister. Then make me your sister. I'm a very small person, madam. What a poor brother can give to his sister? Here is one rupee coin. Please take some sweet. This coin is worth a million for me. Geeta, what are you doing? Are you making this goon your brother? Why? Can't a goon have a sister or mother... Tears in your eyes? Actually, you know madam world hasn't known me. I present strong from outer appearance. But my heart do have a feeling. It seems you've not got anybody's love in life... ...not from parents or siblings. I've got it, madam. Today I've got it. I've got sisterly love in each thread of this. [SOBBING] Listen! Today's lesson is enough for you. You may go. Thank you. If you'd be a simple man I'd have raised a friendly hand towards you. - But this uniform is a hurdle between us. Ok, see you again. - Listen! It'd be better if we won't meet again. Inspector, our relation is such that we'll meet... ...at some or the other corner of life. Ok, madam. Bye, sir! He seems to be a decent man. This man and decent? He can also murder anybody for money. Take this money. Take it. And prepare for the marriage. I've talked with the groom's party. Next Monday they are coming with the procession. Go and start the preparation. I've heard that Shambhu is taking special interest... ...in a one girl's marriage from his area. Her nuptial night will be celebrated at our place. Take away Kaliya with you. - If Shambhu comes in your way then finish him. - Ok, boss. [MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS PLAYING] "Listen, o girl..." "Take your step towards a life with your partner."

Would you like to have something? - Get me coconut water. - Coconut water? [ME N LAUGHING] Fish! And that too outside the water? What's the matter, dear? Very strange! She's not shouting and also not speaking anything. I do not open my mouth without any reason. I've brought a coconut. [LAUGHING] - [WEDDING MUSIC PLAYING] - [FIREWORKS] Hi, Geeta! Oh, you're feeling shy? Did you get the time from your friends? I'm waiting for you since from when. I also had to see off those friends. Otherwise I was so eager to see you. You're seeing it from the childhood. What's new today? I'm not talking about our faces. Rest everything is new, isn't it darling? I mean this decorated bed in this room... ...these flowers will lead me... ...to a new way from before. What's that new way? We won't have any personal identity on that way. That night comes only once in life... ...and it remains forever in the memory. How? Shall I tell you? [MOUTH ORGAN PLAYING] Can I come in? [HACKING] You've already entered. Now what's the use of taking my permission? This is the respect. Since my mother delivered you 15 minutes before me. So you're elder to me by age. And it's younger brother's duty to respect the elder brother. Otherwise who will respect you? Very good! You've taught me what's called decency. Anyway, what's the reason of dropping here suddenly at this time? I'll tell you, brother but won't you offer... ...a glass of whisky to your guest? I've heard that from all the taps in your house... ...only whisky is dropped instead of water. That's not enough. All the drainage and stinking gutters... ...also drop whisky. But you also won't get that. Now come to the point. And go back from the same door you had entered. I've many other works. I'd not have come here even without reason. Since it was something very important I had to come here. I need 10000 rupees. [COUGHING] To enjoy and spend? So did you get the asthma attack? Mr. JK. What decent work you're doing other than just enjoying. Thief's brother is a smuggler. I'm enjoying and my father also was. But I never die my hair like you. I won't give you 10 paisa. Forget 10000 rupees. You're a useful person of my business. I've always dealt anything in my life. If you do my simple work then I can give you 10000 rupees. I knew how mean you're. You can do anything for your own selfish reason. Then I'm nothing. Anyway, since you're my brother. I'll do your job. Then I can fulfil your wish. You want 10000 rupees right? You'll get it. Since you're talking in a business language... ...I'll also talk with you in the same language. Now I want 15000 rupees. I'll do the rest of the collection later. Fine, I'll give you 15000. Who else will be helpful to a brother other than his own brother? DIG: My child, how long you'll celebrate your honeymoon? ANIL: You're too much, daddy. [ALL LAUGHING] Geeta, pass this. - Good morning, sir! - Good morning, Pandey. Come, will you have the breakfast? No, thanks you sir. I've brought some information. CID gang has found out about one gang... ...that is smuggling the drug from our country. The information is that today their packet is... ...going to go out from Hotel Rock and Roll. Any special person involved in this? The doubt goes to one of the partner of that hotel. Mr. Rana. I've also brought his photograph. - ANIL: Show me. - Yes, sir. Show me too. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Just cordon the hotel in the evening. - ANIL: And I'll also come there. Ok? - Yes, sir. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MOUTH ORGAN PLAYING] Police has cordoned us from all the sides. It seems today we'll be caught red handed. GEETA: It won't happen. Geeta, you? How will you help us? I'll help you take out the packet. You're as it is trapped. Why not trust me and try? - But who are you? - I'm inspector Anil's wife. I'm fond of taking drug. I can't fulfil this desire of me from my husband's salary. So sometime I do such things. Mr. Rana, tell your men to wait for me at the telephone booth. And pack everything fast. Shambhu! Go. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Hello, inspector! Geeta you? you and... - What's this? - Cake. I wished to eat it. So I personally came to take it. Fine, you go home. But don't wait for me at dinner. I might get late. It's not new. Ok, I'm leaving. Bye! Listen, Geeta! Please open this. You want to examine me too? Do you doubt your wife? No, I'm feeling very hungry. So I want to eat some cake. Will you open it? Pineapple cake, right? - How's it? - Delicious. And that too like you. Thank you. Now I can take your leave? Yes, sure. [RANA LAUGHING] I got late because of your husband. Your husband, that police inspector... What's his name? Mr. Anil. Very smart. Here's your drug. I thought you forgot. Rana's memory power is very sharp. I never forget anything. That means you also remember this place... ...where you had come with your men some years back. Did you recollect? Looking at this place I can remember... ...that this bungalow belongs to that cornel whom we had... - Whom you had murdered. - Who are you? I'm that cornel's daughter. [WHIPLASHING] Tell me where are the rest of your friends? I don't know. Pintoo must know about it. Who Pintoo? He must be at Manori island in launch. [GUNSHOT] Thank you. Now the revenge of my tyrannical treating begins. [PHONE RINGING] Hello! Yes. DIG Varma here. What? Murder? Whose murder? The same person whose photograph you had seen. - You mean... - Rana! Where? Sir, there's a burnt house on the hill near the lake. The dead body was found there. And surprising thing is that the murder was done with a police revolver. What? My god! My god! Geeta, my child! What's happening? I'm playing patience. This game can be played alone. What's the matter? You seem very disturbed. Yes, my child. The matter is such. I've come to ask you had you been out somewhere yesterday night? No! Do you know one person was killed in the bungalow at hill? May be. What's new in that? The new thing is that the person whose photograph... ...was brought to the diner table that day is murdered. Do you remember? He was some smuggler. His enemy might have killed him. But the murder was done with my revolver. Very good, daddy. You've done this very right by cleaning the dirt from the society. You'll get the medal. But I didn't kill him. First that murderer fired the bullet from my revolver and killed his hunt. It's really surprising that a thievery and in DIG's house? The surprising thing is that 24 hours watch is kept at DIG's house. Nobody can enter inside. This is also true. I'll ask the watchman. Sher Singh! Did anybody come here yesterday night? - No, sir. - Fine, you can go. - Sher Singh! - Yes, sir. Nobody came here yesterday night. But did anybody go out from the house yesterday night? Yes, sir, madam had gone out from the backside door... ...and was back at 2 o'clock. Ok, fine. You may go. My child! One mistake can spoil the entire game. And one lie can disclose the entire truth. Geeta, you must come to the police station with me. - You're under arrest! - Daddy! Do you doubt your daughter in law? And that too on one constable's statement? Anil, I'm very sure about this. My experience is more than your age. Geeta is a murderess. And she has murdered Rana. You can ask yourself. Geeta, what you have to say? I can speak lie with Law. With the world. But I can't speak lie to my husband. My answer... this is my answer. Inspector, you and here? Geeta has come to you. Bring her out. What's this? Rich sisters do not come to the poor brother's house. Blood never lies. Geeta is injured. And her blood marking is here. Blood is mine. Actually... I was sharpening my knife near the well. And got cut. But I didn't get one thing, sir. Why are you after sister Geeta? She's guilty. She has murdered somebody. No, sir. I'm sure you're mistaking. - She can't do this. - Shambhu. She's just your sister by word. But she's my wife. Madam, come out. Your husband has gone. What's this, brother? You cut your hand to save me? Look, Madam. Whether you're a drug addict or not. Once I called you my sister. So Shambhu can offer his life at times for his sister. I'm not a drug addict. I mean it. If you're right then your husband is wrong. That means you didn't do the murder. You've considered me your sister. I won't speak lie to you. Yes, I've murdered Rana. - Rana? - Yes. Now I understood. That's why you did this drama. But why? Because Rana and his friends had killed my Parents during my childhood. And they also separated my brother from me. [SOBBING] Don't cry. If God really exist then you'll definitely get your brother one day. Women's Shelter - Good morning, madam! This... - My name is Mrs. Disa. Mistress? Are you married? Yes. But then who you became nun? It's my destiny. My family members didn't like my work. And I had to leave from my house. Strange! You're doing the noble work and they don't appreciate? Even in your religion Meera's husband didn't appreciate her work. It's one's destiny. - DIG: Anil! - Yes! You're going to the market so... Daddy, she's Mrs. Disa. Our new neighbour. - He's my father. - Glad to meet you. - Come to our house someday. - Sure, sir. - I'll definitely come to your house. - It's my pleasure. This photo frame was broken. Please get it repaired. Ok! I'll take your leave, Mrs. Disa! Thank you. Okay. - Is this your wife's photo? - Yes, Mrs. Disa. Not the glass but our fate has broken. God bless! That means these girls are alone in this world. They will help me in every work. And will always be ready to offer their life for me. But what if they got arrested? They have taken a vow that... ...your secret will never be disclosed. Good. Now our next hunt is Pintoo. [MUSIC] "You're the king of Mumbai and I'm the queen of ocean."

Why you need to change? - Come, my fish. - Fish has come. How would you wish to eat? By boiling or by frying? - Who are you? - This pistol belongs to Rana. - And I... - You've murdered Rana? I won't kill you. But with one condition. Give me the address of that twine brothers. I don't know. [WHIPLASHING] Here it is. You too had killed my father like this. [LAUGHING] You still have a time. Give me his address. JK stays in Mumbai. Even the police don't have his address. - He's the underworld king. - Ok. Then you too become the king of underground. Please let go off me. I don't know anything. [GUNSHOT] Oh Welcome! Welcome, Mrs. Disa, welcome. - Holy cross? - Thank you. Please come. Come. - Greeting, Mrs. Disa. - God bless you, mother! What's the matter? You seem very sick? What to say, madam? I don't know why God is disappointed with me? God never get disappointed. He takes the exam. We must keep patience in his exam. - Come, Mrs. Disa. Please come. - Come. Please have a seat. - Thank you, sir. - It's my pleasure. DIG sir, I wanted to take your help. My help? Tell me. Some goons are teasing the girls of my centre. If we say anything. They threaten us with the name JK. I want to know who's this JK? JK is a dangerous man in the world of crime. You give me his address. I'll preach him. I'll make him an angle. Nobody knows anything about him. Police is also in search of him. - Daddy! - Look, Mrs. Disa... Hello, Mrs. Disa! God bless! - You were saying something? - Yes, daddy. One dead body is found near the seashore. His name is Pintoo. He was the old friend of Rana. DIG: Rana's old friend? Some goons was the second hunt of Getea. No, daddy. Police has arrested Shambhu from the spot. He'll be presented in the court tomorrow morning. [EXPLOSION] - Sir! Shambhu! - Wow! Today you did a great job. You're really great! - Papa! - Don't you dare call me papa? Did I shelter you and bring you up for this day? But what have I done? Rogue, how dare you murder my partner Pintoo? - But I didn't murder Pintoo. - Don't lie. By swear of god I never speak lie. I'm totally under your obligation. I won't say a single alas even if you take away my life. But don't put this wrong charge on me. Don't insult me this way. Then who murdered Pintoo? The same girl who murdered Rana. Who's that girl? My sister by words and inspector Anil's wife Geeta. Now I can sense the truth in your words. She has also killed Rana. Fire's revenge is fire and murder's revenge is murder. And you'll punish her. But I've made her my sister. At one side is the order of your nurturer papa. And on the other hand is the question of your considered sister's life. Now you must decide, Shambhu. GEETA: "It seems you've not got anybody's love in life not from parents or siblings." JK: "At one side is the order of your nurturer papa." "And on the other hand is the question of your considered sister's life." "It seems you've not got anybody's love in life not from parents or siblings." "At one side is the order of your nurturer papa." "And on the other hand is the..." "...question of your considered sister's life." Now you must decide, Shambhu. [SIREN WAILING] - Listen, which is Smabhu's house? - There, sir. Who's there? Mother! Please help me. Don't call me mother. Call me sister. Holy Mary was a mother. I think you're innocent. Police is unnecessarily following you. Don't worry. We get blessing from mother. Then you also must be feeling that... ...papa's order has kept me so much in trouble. - You also have a father? - Not real one. I've just considered him. He has brought me up and now he's telling me to murder a girl. You must obey his order. But, I've considered her my sister. Now at one side is my father's order and on the other hand... ...is a sister's murder. I'm so confused. Why your father wants to kill that girl? Because that girl has killed my papa's partner. But I don't understand how can I kill Geeta? - But I also have to listen to... - What's your father's name? JK! Then the problem is solved. I'll preach him in such a way that he'll become an angle. You just give me his address. He lives in the tegari's forests. But you please don't go there, sister. He's very desirous type of man. His evening passed with liquors and girls. Rosary is broken. Now your father's time has come. Sunny, park taxi properly it's stolen. Where's papa? He has gone with the same dancer whom you had sent? What? "This age and this style." "May god grace!" "Who's going to be killed today." "May god grace!" "This age and this style." "May god grace!" "This age and this style." "May god grace!" "This age and this style." "May god grace!" "Who's going to be killed today." "May god grace!" "Who's going to be killed today." "May god grace!" "This age and this style." "May god grace!" "You've impressed me in such a way." "That my heart has gone crazy." "I was so innocent that I was moving on the branches." "And was targeted by someone." "Today you're the emperor f time." "A storm is in my being, today." "A shame has to fight a shame today." "Fire must be put out with fire." "I've played this game, my tyrant." "I've little shame left with me." "May god grace!" "I've little shame left with me." "May god grace!" "I've little shame left with me." "May god grace!" "Who's going to be killed today." "May god grace!" "Who's going to be killed today." "May god grace!" "May god grace! May god grace!" "This age and this style." "May god grace!" "Beauties, those lanes are still young..." "...where I've offered my youth." "Many offer their youth in love." "What a big deal if you're one of them?" "This sight and this style." "May god grace!" "This sight and this style." "May god grace!" "Today I'm only injured." "May god grace!" "Today I'm only injured." "May god grace!" "This is not a wound. It's a reality." "I'm habitual to speak the truth." "I've changed my name and disguise." "I've changed this disguise for you." "Today I've come to your party..." "...with a wish in my heart." "Today I want to bend you..." "I must show you this play today." "We'll see who will bend whom?" "I'll see the shadows of your hair." "This body is made of glass. It's a small golden thread." "Whenever I'll hold it once." "I'll embrace it tight in my arms." "Your spot will be washed out and your ego will be broken." "You want to bend me... But do you even know..." "...that this crown is made of thorn." "May god grace!" "This crown is made of thorn." "May god grace!" "This crown is made of thorn." "May god grace!" "Who's going to be killed today." "May god grace!" "Who's going to be killed today." "May god grace!" "This age and this style." "May god grace!" "How will you come to attack?"

You wish to kiss a girl." "You've said my heart's wish." "You've said this yourself." "Let the night reach it's extreme..." "...under the soothing moonlight." "Tell me what will happen in those seasons..." "...in those flows of wind." "I'll show you the strength of my arms." "I'll make you tour the heaven." "I'm the angle... I'll treat..." "Now I'll give treatment to all your sickness." "May god grace!" "Now I'll give treatment to all your sickness." "May god grace!" "Now I'll give treatment to all your sickness." "May god grace!" Wow! And this. Darling! [MOUTH ORGAN PLAYING] Where are you? I'm making these moments beautiful. So that your memory can be refreshed. Do you recollect this tune? To hell will this tune. I've come running till here for something... ...first satisfy that thirst, my darling. That too will be satisfied, Mr. JK. Do you recognise this place? Very well. This is the place where I and my partners... ...had killed Cornel Rajesh and his wife some years back. And now after coming to this ruin I've also recognised you. You're the one who has killed my partners Rana and Pintoo. You're Geeta! To be precise you can also call me your death. My gun will decide who's whose death? [WHIPLASH] - No! Geeta! No! - Leave me. - What are you doing? - Leave me! Leave me, brother! He has killed my parents. - No! Sister! - I won't let him go alive. - He has brought me up. He's like my father. - Leave me. What happened, Geeta? - Brother, he killed mummy and daddy. - What? Geeta! My real sister! Geeta! How long you'll run, JK? Your time has come. [GUNSHOTS] What happened, brother Shambhu? Call me Bunty. - Bunty? - Yes, Geeta. I'm your lost brother. I had forgotten everything because of the injury in my brain. But today I've recollected everything. Brother Bunty! Come, Anil. Did you get any more information? Yes, daddy. This murder also took place at the same spot where Rana was killed. - You mean one more hunt of Geeta? - Yes. And this kerchief was found from the dead body's pocket. And this ring was also found at the spot. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Look at this. Whose photo is this. This is our neighbour Mrs. Disa. Look at this. That means we must cordon the bungalow. What do you say, daddy? Don't forget that she must have arranged for some door to escape. Then what we must do? Is Mrs. Disa at home? Good morning! I'm your neighbour DIG Verma. Yes. Look, today is my son's birthday. I'll be really obliged if you attend the party tonight. I'll surely come! Sure! God bless your son. Thank you! Thank you very much. [INDISCERNIBLE] Today? Birthday? Geeta, this is my husband's trick. They have recognised you. You please don't go there... ...please don't go there, my child. No, mother! This is my father in law's order. But I can't see... You in handcuff in that house where you had put on the nuptial bangles. He had put on the nuptial bangles and today... Mummy... He only will put on the hand cuffs. Please bless me. If this is your obstinacy then I pray god for your protection. DIG sir! Where's DIG sir? Come! Most welcome! Most welcome! Many happy returns of the day. Thank you! Thank you very much. The guests haven't come? Now that you've come. The guests will also come from all the sides. Please have a seat. Mrs. Disa, before the guests come. I need to talk with you something very important. Tell me. One of my friend's name is DSP Mr. Gupta. Police officers will have friendship with some police officer. He can't be a thief or a criminal. Correct Mrs. Disa. Mr. Gupta had a childhood friend he was an army officer. Some goons killed him. Police and army people's life are always in danger. What to do? After all he was an army officer. Ok so what your friend Mr. Gupta did then? He brought his friend's daughter at home... ...and brought her up like his own child. And when she grew up he got her married with his son. You did this very nice. God will bless your friend. But after some days of her marriage that girl... ...murdered one person from those killers. It was right. There's nothing wrong to take the revenge of our parent's death. But she took the law in hand. And even after escaping from home she changed her appearance and kept... ...on visiting Mr. Gupta's house. Why she won't? Her father in law and her husband are there. But Mr. Gupta recognised her. So he planned and invited her home one day. Now you tell me, Mrs. Disa, can that girl really escape? DIG sir. If that girl had gone to your friend's house... ...then she too might have made some plan? [LAUGHING] When the police must be standing outside Mr. Gupta's... ...bungalow what could be that girl's plan? You must have read in the newspaper that... ...a biggest jewellery shop has been robbed today. Consider that the police comes there and that girl says that... ...she did this robbery with the help of DSP Gupta then? But how she'll prove this? Why? If the necklace will be found from... ...Mr. Gupta's pocket during the checking... ...then what prestige your friend will have? [DRAMATIC MUSIC] If this will really happen then Mr. Gupta will be in trouble. And it's also possible that the girl might have... ...kept the rest of the gold ornaments at Mr. Gupta's house? What? But where she can hide it? - There are people at home. - So what? There are many places at home. For example... she can also hide it in the flower vase. Anyway, let go off that. Mr. Gupta will solve his problem. But you've brought nice flowers. It's very fresh. Just smell It. So, DIG sir? Aren't you pleased? Yes, very much. I didn't understand one thing. How that girl escaped from Mr. Gupta's house? Come, I'll show you the entire map. Please come. After you. Please come! Please. Mr. Gupta's bedroom was almost similar to this. And Mr. Gupta was standing here at my place. And his daughter in law was standing there. Will you please go back little? You... yes, little... that's right. And his son was standing there. Now you tell me how can she escape in such situation? DIG sir, very simple. It's very easy. - How? - Like this. Officer, follow her. Brother Smabhu! Brother Smabhu! What happened, Geeta? What happened? My secret is out. Police is following me. This is very bad. Take care of yourself. I think police's scare has made her unconscious. We must hide her somewhere. Mulla's house will be better. Nobody will have a doubt. Right. Let's take her there. - Mulla! - What happened, my child? - Not yet, but it'll happen. - What? I don't know that. But Shambhu will surely become an uncle. Almighty! Have your grace at both of them! Look, my lord! I tell you everything. But you never answer me. Anyway, today also you must listen. The matter is very serious. Listen to me carefully. Look, I don't care about myself. But my younger sister is pregnant. Now her entire responsibility is on you. I'm out of it. Okay? I'm going. - Take this Prasad, my child! - Thank you! May you live long! I was really scared. But god has shown us the ray of light. - Now you need to take rest. - No, brother. Till I won't take my revenge I won't take rest. Again that same thing? You're going to give birth to a new life. How can you snatch others life? I'll definitely snatch it. Ok, fine. Have this Prasad first. I've brought it from the temple. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] What happened, Geeta? He's my fourth and last hunt. - Sangram. - Show it to me. You're also great, my lord! But he's in jail from long time. He's passing through the punishment of life imprisonment. But you don't worry. I'll personally go to jail to kill him. Sir, I've come to surrender. Shambhu! But then why did you play hide and seek with police? Now what's the use of all that, sir? Law needed me. So, I'm here. Send me in. - Naik! - Sir! Arrest him. C'mon. This time your program is scheduled to go to the central jail. My program is scheduled. Then why are you so sad? - C'mon, laugh. - Naik! - C'mon. C'mon. - Okay. Lines of your hand are telling that your time is over now. Can't you see all the prisoners are standing apart... ...with the fear of this Sangram? My time will come after going out from here. But I think you'll die here only inside the jail walls. - If you won't recognise me. - Who are you? My name is Shambhu. And JK has sent me to take you out from here. JK. That means his big deal is stuck up somewhere... ...and that's why he has remembered me. Otherwise he'd have got it done with the help of his men. Why would he remember me? You're right. But I really didn't understand something. What? You're a dangerous lion then... ...why are you locked in this cage? That same old weakness. Weakness? What weakness? - Not this weakness. I'm talking about this. - I see. Actually, you know I've played with many girls in life. That means you must have married to many girls. I've done everything except marriage. But the pleasure that is in this handcuff... ...is not found in the flowers. And one day a beautiful girl came in my trap. And I reached to her house with all the robbed jewelleries. [MUSIC PLAYING ON THE RADIO] [MUSIC OFF] Sangram! Welcome, brother in law. Now take care of your sister. I'm going. You can't go from here by insulting my sister. Insult? I've paid her enough in favour. If you don't believe me then look at her body. You'll find the symbol of my name at every place. You don't believe? Look at this. You rogue! Now your body will have a symbol of my name. What's the need of this between us? [GROANING IN PAIN] [GROANING IN PAIN] Now tell me. What was my fault in this? This brother-sister's relation is very strange. Now see, a brother gets his sister marry. He also becomes an uncle. And feels great. But before his sister's marriage if he become uncle... ...he comes out with a knife. I just don't understand this system. - Do you get anything? - No. Anil. I didn't understand this Shambhu a notorious brother in law of yours. He's an emotional goon. He has sympathy for poor. For the first time he's arrested in a murder case. He tried to escape from Law. But when he realised that it's impossible... ...to escape he surrendered. This is Shmabhu's story. But what link it has with Geeta's story? As per this file. When you had raided at Rana's hotel... ...Shambhu and Geeta both were present there. When Geeta escaped from the house... ...she ran towards the same colony where Shambhu stays. When police came to our bungalow following Shambhu... ...till then he was disappeared. Because Geeta was staying in our neighbouring bungalow being Mrs. Disa. And again Geeta was found running towards the same... ...colony in the disguise of Mrs. Disa. That means Shambhu and Geeta both are working together. And that colony is the shelter of Geeta. Have you seen all the houses? Only Mulla's house is left, sir. But there are no chances of her presence over there. When there's no chance. You get the answer there. - Which is that house. C'mon, show me. - Yes. I believe in Allah. And I'm not concern with anybody except Allah. I know. But I'm helpless. I too must do my duty. I won't stop you doing your duty. But still you must wait for some time. - Why? - Because my daughter is having a labour pain. Her delivery can take place any time. [WOMAN GROANING] - O god! - Not god! Say Allah! - Ya Allah! - Allah! Allah! - Allah will solve your problem. - Never mind. I'll wait. Mulla-ji, the girl's condition is critical. Mother and child's life is at risk. - Now what to do, aunty? - Let's take her to the hospital. They might be operated and can be saved. Allah! Now what to do? Sister, police is waiting outside and the girl's life is at risk. It's also not possible to take them to the hospital. That means both mother and child won't be saved. Human has no power to decide about life and death. You do your duties. I'll pray to almighty for her. Oh my Lord! "Allah is the protector of this world." "Allah is the protector of this world." "Have your grace on all your children." "Allah is the protector of this world." "Allah! Allah!" [KID CRYING] Congratulation, Mulla-ji! Ge... Sister Gulshan delivered a child. It's the grace of Allah! I hope mother and child both are fine. Yes, both are fine. My child, just arrange for the curtain. Okay. - Inspector wants to search our house. - Ok. - But it'll take some time. - Ok. BIJLI: Mulla-ji, you can come in. Please come in, inspector. Please come in. You search inside. [KID CRYING] Look at him, inspector. He's so cute! He's really cute! You're the first one to bless him right after his birth. I'm sure he'll also become an inspector one day. Why not? But... - Why is he crying so much? - My dear. Please be quite. Wow! Good boy! My good boy! CONSTABLE: Sir, nobody is there inside. - I'm really sorry for the trouble. - It's ok. C'mon, it's time for lunch. C'mon. Fast... Hurry up! You too. It's time for lunch. But open our handcuff first. Otherwise he'll hold the plate and I'll eat. Ok, fine. I'll tie it later. C'mon, now! Shambhu, please bring one plate for me. - I'm going to eat and not to taste. - Then take this. Did you disobey Sangram Singh's order? I won't let you remain alive. I'll chop you into pieces. - Slowly. It hurts. - Move! I have to do what not to escape from the jail. Not so soon. People will have doubt. - Doubt? - Stop! It hurts! It hurts! I'll kill you. Hello! Hello! Police hospital. Two prisoners are injured here. Please send the ambulance immediately. [AMBULANCE SIREN WAILING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] Yes, speaking. What? Shambhu has escaped with a dangerous prisoner like Sangram? O my god! Officer. Send this information to the Anil right now. Ok, sir. - Did you check in all the houses? - Yes. Salute, sir! Sher Khan, what are you doing here? That house is mine. That means you must know everybody in this area. What? A murderess is hiding in this colony. Girl? Yes, sir. One girl is staying in Mulla-ji's house. Not that. She's Mulla-ji's daughter. No, sir. Mulla-ji does not have any children. I've not seen any girl at his house from last 15 years. Sir. Mulla-ji, where's Geeta? - She has left. - Left? - You know she's a murderess. - Yes. - And still you sheltered her here? - Sir, DIG sir has sent a message. Shambhu has escaped from jail with Sangram Singh. Now we're not at risk. I think police can't come till here. Above the sky and under the earth. Only I rule this place. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Now tell me. What have you think of me? A stupid, or a foolish man? What do you mean? Just a minute! What do you want from me? How this pistol appeared between us? Shut up! Only pistol can help us get the answers to some questions. And I'm not a foolish that I may not understand your plan. My brother JK died long back. And it was also printed in the newspaper. And you might have forgotten that the newspapers are... ...also made available in the jail. Tell me quickly. Otherwise my pistol is not habitual to remain silent for longer. What do you want from me? Who are you? I also don't want to play hide and seek with you. Fine, I'll tell you who I am. Do you remember Bunty? Who Bunty? Refresh your memory. You'll come to know everything. Do you remember 15 years before you... ...and your brother JK had killed a cornel and his wife... ...with the help of two more friends? This Shambhu is their son Bunty. And is thirsty to pour your blood. [LAUGHING] Very good! I'd have pardoned your life... ...if you could be someone else. But I've not learnt to pardon the snake's breed. C'mon, get ready to die. [WHIPLASH] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Geeta, you're my daughter in law later. But first you're the criminal for Law. Surrender yourself to the police. Otherwise my duty will compel me to pass the order to shoot you. Geeta, being a husband I'm telling you. Don't take Law in your hand. This will prove you a criminal. Boss, inspector's Anil's child. Don't you dare! Don't touch my child! Give me! Give this child to me. Otherwise I'll kill him right here. Now I'll enjoy the game. Inspector. Your son's life in the form of this child is in my hand. DIG, if you try to fire at me. I'll kill this inheritor of yours. Keep the guns down. You'll be responsible for this child's death. You stay here. - Ok, boss. - Take care. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Surrender yourself! [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] - My child! - Geeta, what did you do? I'm sorry. But I was helpless. Geeta, my child! Daddy, your grandchild. I confess for the crime I did. Arrest me. Bring the handcuffs. And to me too. Today we took the revenge that was due to us from our parents. I am ready for punishment.
