Apart from those ghosts soldiers... ...you also have the wrath of Shih Huang Ti whose corpse was on that ship. At that time, he had been waken up once. Luckily, he had been weighed down by a magic sword. But the curse, that was made by the death 3 centuries ago... ...is to be fulfilled now. What do you mean, Priest? A good pomelo doesn't sink, nor does good rice. Village Elder, with angry souls haunted, bad things will happen. An opera show on the death anniversary may keep those evil spirits at bay.

Hold on, Miss. Miss, wait for me. I can't, it's coming. Can't you hold on for a few more minutes. It'll be a mess if I waited any longer. Come here. I'll tell you something. I need to shit. - Really? - It's welling out. Yes? Any second. Fix things up at once. Just, keep calm. I'll come out when I am done. No, I mean after the delivery. Make way, I need it urgently. At this very moment? I need the toilet too. Take my place. Ghost! - What now? - I don't know. What a relief! I feel dizzy. Come back quickly, sister. Where are they? Doing the same thing as you did. Go out and surrender to the pagoda, or die. - Uncle Sheng, as I said, you never know. - Right! Ching. Ching, I'm back. Good, or I can't hold on any longer. You bloody monk, this time, I'll fight with you... What are you up to again, Miss? - I guess it's twins. - Are you sure? - I'm going to give birth again. - Wait! Me too... I must deliver.

This is the treasure map of the pagoda. Inside is the key for entry. The richest in the world. Private property. Master, oh no! Someone's got killed. It's not me, I didn't kill him. - He is not our man! - What can we do now - You said something? - Yes, it's me. I know everyone in this village, include the owner of those dogs! I have never seen this man before! Are you trying to deny? - We really don't know him! - Nonsense, We never meet him before. Well, you guys don't admit, I can't do anything! But at the mean time, you all can't leave here and need to show up whenever I call! - Sir, I've got the evidence at last. - What evidence? They were defecating everywhere on the slope. Bring the droppings back as evidence. Goodbye, Johnny. I'm not Johnny, I'm Richard. - Bye-bye, Richard. - Richard? With this treasure map, we're going to be a millionaire We can't read, it's useless to us. Ask Lin. No way! We can't let him know our secret. Right. What are you doing? What's this word say? Mei. And this? Tao. And this? Ti. - How about this? - Show me. You are such a maniac! - Come on, I'm going to sleep! - Okay! Shui, Hua, Fu, Chu. Sounds like some kind of incantation. One plum blossom grows at south of the village; Rising from the rock; Water dripping from the rock; Mists and clouds rise up the high mountains; Water flowing down the south of the village; A hunchback seeks the pearl; and helped by 8 demigods; 2 Yi begets 4 quadrants; Chien turns and Kun moves; Private property; The richest family of all.

Solve them now! A Hunchback seeks the pearl. and helped by 8 demigods. 2 Yi begets 4 quadrants; Chien turns and Kun moves. The last 2 sentences should linked with the octagram.

If it doesn't work, may be the 27th Army. Long live liberty. Long live liberty. Chien said this is the corpse of the Emperor, Shih Huang Ti. Once he absorbs the power of the sun and moon, he'll be unbeatable! A normal mahogany sword nor any spell can overpower him. Only the magic sword and the 3 coins can Kill him. Then he can never be reincarnated. Why we need the coins, Sir? The coins canl break his spirit. Only by putting them in his mouth first, then the sword can get him. Understand? - Yes. - Wait for me! - Why are you coming back? - Wait for me. Wonder who made that raft? It scattered when hit by waves. Luckily, I was able to swim back to the shore! What are your plans? Mine? Marry your mother and be your dad! And have a son to be your brother. Come on, brat. - You're going to marry my mum? - Yes. Long live liberty. I thought you went back to get your gun. Why you brought back a hoe? For Digging potatoes? Just in case, understand? What are you doing? What did I do? You look so silly. Why? Incredible! Can you hear any strange sounds? What sounds? I just farted. Luckily, you didn't hear it Is Chien trustable, sir? We don't have any choice. We'll be finished if we can't get the magic sword. Go down. You're so clumsy. - It looks very deep, sir. - Really? How deep? We can have better estimation if we know how deep it is. You go down then. Master. What now? At least we've three cushions. Three cushions? You go down first then. So, there are 4 now, Chiu. Let's go down. What's this? - Are you alright? - Yes It's so high. It's a fatal fall. So many snakes! Yes, so many! Sir. Watch out!

Is it because of the snake poison? Here it is, there is the trap. Chen, see if there's a hidden triangular switch... ...springing out at the side. Yes, sir. I found it, sir! There's a hidden switch here! Just as Chien told us! Chen, you must push it, not pull it. Yes, sir. - Don't ever pull back. - Yes, sir. What happened? I don't know. The wall's moving towards us. What now? Jump over, quickly! Help! Excuse me. I'm coming too. So scary! Let's jump together. Chiu, give me your hand, quick. Just go, don't bother about me. Another boulder is heading down from above! There're 2 holes behind us. Chiut! This's our last chance, come on! It's over. Don't look down if you're scared. Luckily, I can hold on with your belt. It is not the belt. Alright now. Fixed. THINK and it'll work! At worst I'll just sacrifice my legs. Al Lang-his is coming soon. Why's that rock is pulled out? Out again? Chen Lung-shin. Watch out! Keep an eye on him. Hit him if anything happens. Yes sir, don't worry! Quiet, or I'll beat you. - You just farted! - Well, beat him. According to Chien I-mao, there's a key in this water cave to the treasure. And in it, is a tunnel. Only we find the key, we can open the door to the treasure room. Why didn't you bring the scuba outfit? You want me drowned? I've got them! I have got a few goggles. Want it? Better than nothing. Give me one, master. Master, let's match up in the water frolics. Frolic in the water with her? You go down first. Me first? Can tell he can't swim. Master, you can't swim? No. Don't worry, I'll show you how to hold the breath. Look. Sister. Don't believe a big man can't swim. Shameful! I'd suicide if I am you. Nonsense. Oh no, sister's still down below. I can't leave her behind. There looks like a tunnel over there. Let's go and have a look. Should be here. The keyhole is here. - Why doesn't it move? - No response. This time we're going to be rich. Yes! The 3 coins? The magic sword. You farted again? No, not me this time! - You then? - Yes. He speaks again. He must be beaten That's not fair! I told you not to be greedy. Now you hit the trap and it's collapsing. Run now! Leaving the gold behind? You can't live to own it. Run! Come on up - Oh no, now even the gold ingot is gone. - Forget it. Hurry up! Go over there. - Come over. - Watch up. Come over. Master, I'll follow you. Run! Run quickly. Nothing can beat me... Where's that thing now? May be he knew that we've got the magic sword? Good. This revenge thing is all over! Let's go back to HK and find some women to celebrate. Just like that? Feel sorry for the superballs. But you are alive. You can grab as many as you can if you've still got hands. You want to know if he's here? Easy. How? He's already left. No point to find him. Go away! How? Just now we sneaked into the village, he probably couldn't hear us. But if we shout, he'll appear! Right. No, Don't! It's too horrible! Ass ghost? Strike him! Another one has fled away. Follow him. I am much stronger than him, he's 2000 years old. This will kill you. He can't fly now. I'm invincible in the whole world! That monster becomes berserk after taking that coin. What then? We still have two more. How can we get close to it? The magic sword is with him. Listen, at that time, scholars if meddling in politics and gatherings... ...would all be buried alive. Repeat the history by stabbing the emperor. Get his trust and get back the magic sword. You are so smart, sir. How come there's a layer of red clouds from afar? Must be the burned down of the Wupang Palace. Long live Your Majesty! Greetings to Your Majesty!
