(all murmuring) - But he answered them, an evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign-- - [Preacher] Ah! An evil generation (all murmuring) got to have a sign (all shouting) before they could come to understanding the love of God. (all murmuring) - There he goes again. - See it's like today, young people are always asking for a sign. (all shouting) Don't, don't think because you are young, that's not plenty time.

Hey! What happened? - Simple, little one. Me and Ella Mae been getting together a whole lot lately. We been gettin' tighter and tighter. - So? - So, it was in my mind, maybe in hers too. - Okay, what are you talking about? - Well, don't you see? That's how the devil works. Just when you ain't got nothing in your mind, that's when he jump in there and start telling you things. - Things like what? - Like how pretty Sister Ella Mae look, and how maybe you want to touch her, so much so that you can't even breathe, and you feel like you've got to do something, but you can't do nothing. - I get those feelings, about girls in school and-- - You got to fight them feelings. You got to fight them hard, little John. - How? - By putting your mind on the Lord. Man, they'll be plenty of time for all of them other things when you get older. Follow, little John? - Hey, why you gotta call me little? - Because you's frail and little. And I'm big and strong. - Uh huh, is that what you think? - Yeah, that's what I think. - Well one of these days, I'm gonna surprise you. - You gonna be tough when you get older, huh? Well you do that. You surprise me. Hey, ain't that your brother, Roy, over there on the corner? - Yo, I know it's not your brand, man. - [Boy] That chocolate has smoke, man. - What are you doing smoking, Royal? - Man, take your hands of me, big brother. - We gotta get home, or we're both gonna catch it, so come on. - I'll see y'all later, all right? (laughing) - You need to stop hanging around those hoodlums. - Those hoodlums are my friends, so you better leave them alone. - [Florence] So what kind of meat you gonna put in these boys? - [Elizabeth] I've got some good fat back over here. - [Florence] I don't like no fat back me myself, I like ham. - Stay out of my business. Aunt Florence, how you doing? - Boy, you got so tall. - Where you two been all this time? Oh, look at your clothes. What you been doing? - Nothing, Mama. - Go on, clean yourself up. - Do you think you can come town with me later, help me carry some packages? - Roy, you know I will. - Aw, now come on give me another hug here. - You know what? I wouldn't ask you, I'm just a little tired. You know, I'm resting-- - What's all this noise? Doesn't anybody have respect for the Sabbath? Elizabeth? - I'll keep them quiet, Gabriel. - Get in here, boy. - Sometimes, watching that boy, he reminds me so much of my father. Got the same way of laughing. Same quiet way of holding in hurt. Papa always used to tell me, "When you cry, cry alone. "Never let the world see you. "Never ask for mercy, and if you've "got to die, then go on and die, but just don't let nobody "beat you down." - Just don't let nobody beat you down. Your father must have been a mighty fine man, Elizabeth. - I was his only child. (laughing) I gotta check on these boys. - [Gabriel] You been doing your daily reading from the Bible? - [John] Yes, sir. - I don't mean just on Sunday, I mean all during the week. - [John] Yes-- - Speak up, what? - [John] Yes, sir. - Got time to be reading them books them white people give you. The least you can do is study the word of the Lord. - [John] Yes, sir. - Mm-hmm. Give me that yes, sir. And no, sir. You ain't fooling me, boy. You better be studying. I'm warning you. A man can't grow up to be a preacher, unless he know that bible inside and out. Forwards and backwards. - But does he have to make that decision right now, Gabriel? I mean after all, he's still just a little boy. - This boy knows that ain't nobody here rushing him into anything. But the way of the Lord takes a long, long time. And anyway, if you remember, I was studying the Bible when I was even younger than him. - I don't remember it doing you too much good. - Say what? - Until later, that is. - If you ain't going to help, Florence, it ain't no point in you saying anything. Anyway, it wasn't me said he should be a preacher. He's the one been saying that, ever since is was a little boy. Ain't that right, John? Hmm? - Yes, sir. - Mm hmm. All I'm doing is trying to tell him what the price is. - Right. Right. - And you being the oldest. You should be setting an example for your brother, Roy. - Now how he gonna do that? Roy got his own way of doing things. Can't nobody tell him what to do, Not even you. - Florence! How many times I have to tell you! - You expect me to stand here! - Never mind. Just never mind. This is the Sabbath. And I at least intend to respect that. (sighing) See, I can't even talk to my own family in my own house, without interference. Well maybe I can talk to my God. - But you're not making any sense, Gabriel. All I'm trying to say, Jesus, that brother of mine. Damn. (sighing) (light humming) (wind howling) - I don't know to do with you, Gabriel. I pray everyday, and nothing seems to change. - I'm sorry, Mama. - I don't want to see you grow up shiftless, and die in a shameful state. I pray everyday against it, but it seems that my prayers just ain't doing any good. - I know, Mama. I'm going to try, and I'm going to change. - [Florence] When Hell freezes over. - I am not a well woman. My time here is short. - I promise, Mama. You'll see. - Come on, Gabriel, walk us home. - I done told you twice, Flo, Now go on. - You coming in, honey? - I've got other fish to fry. - You gonna fall right out of the frying pan into another fire, Gabriel. - Let's go on, Florence. - Now if you must, you go on. Maybe I can escort Ms. Deborah here home. - Thanks anyway. Gabe. (laughing) (laughing) - [Florence] Girl, she looked so terrible. Did you see that dress she wearing? - [Deborah] Mm-hmm. I'll tell you. (men chattering) - [Man] Look at this. (ominous orchestral music) (man laughing) (screaming) - Run, Florence. Run! (screaming) (crying) Run, Florence, run! (screaming) - [Deborah] Lord say hate the sin, not the sinner. - I know, but I hate him. And I hate this town. I'm gonna leave it. Just you wait and see. Now if you were smart, you'd leave it too. - This Shame gonna follow me no matter where I take myself. Whenever folk look at me, they're gonna say, that the girl the white man ruined. So I may as well stay here. (door creaking) - [Mom] Oh my God. Sweet Jesus, I'm asking you. Help me, you're stronger. - That all you planning to do? Say prayers while the boy puke all over his self? - Child, fix your brother some coffee. - [Florence] I ain't fixing nothing for him. - [Mom] What's the matter with you? - [Florence] I been fixing for him since the day he was born. I'm through. - What you mean? - I'm going, Mama. - [Mom] Going, child? Going where? - North, Mama. - Florence, honey, I want you to close your eyes and pray with me. - No, Mama. I done prayed enough. My mind is made up. - Oh, God. What are you doing to me? Letting the devil get into my house, stealing my children. - Bye, Mama. I gotta go. I'm sorry. - [Florence] Florence, you can't leave like this. - Watch me. - You can't leave Mama. - [Florence] Why not? She got you. - But you is the one she need. I can't do for her like you do. - She never needed me. It's always been you. Always. - Florence! Dammit, Florence! You gonna pay for this! - I done already paid, Gabriel! Long and hard! - We just different, your father and I. Like oil and water, like you and Roy. - [John] Ah, but we get along. - Not always, now. I've seen you two together. - Mama loves Daddy anyway. - Yeah. - And he had another wife too, didn't he? - Yeah. Poor soul, she's dead and gone. Mm mm mm. Phew. - But why does he have to be like that? So hard and cold, and yet read from the Bible all the time? - Now you asking me a whole lot of questions I ain't got no answers for. Nobody knows why people is the way they is, or why they do the things they do. Well put those packages down over there. - Oh, thank you. How come you never had any children, Aunt Florence? Someone to be around you. Help take care of you? - Just wasn't in the cards. I had me a husband, I should have had me some children. Just wasn't in the cards, I guess. Sit down. - Well maybe-- - Hand me them zippers over there, boy. Thank you. - I don't want to go back to that house. It, it's like he's watching me all the time, just waiting for me to make one mistake, just so he can jump one. - I know it. - Well, well then, could I come and live with you, Aunt Florence? - Oh Angel, nothing would make me happier, but a boy has got to stay with this family. You gotta stay there and work out those difficulties. You belong there. John. - And Ezekiel fell down upon his knees, and God said unto him, "Son of man, stand up on your feet. "I'm going to send you unto Israel, a nation that "is sinned," are you listening to me, boy? - [Roy] Yes, sir. - All right. Fine. Elizabeth, guide us away, will you? - "Ezekiel went down among the Israelites and asked them (coughing) "and asked them to turn away from their wicked ways "and idle worship. "Some listened to him, and some stubbornly refused." - That's the way it is. That's the way it has always been. - "Then God instructed Ezekiel "to take up a big clay tile (coughing) "and to draw the city of Jerusalem." - John, continue where your mother left off, if you know the place. - "When Ezekiel made his journey, God told him "that enemy can't"-- - Hold it. Read it with some feeling. This is the word of God, not some school book. - "When Ezekiel-- (John sighing) - Never mind. Give it to your brother. Show him where you left off. - "One day is, is, is-- - Spell it. How many times I have to tell you. Spell out the word if you don't know how to say it. - I-S-R-A-E-L. - Israel. Go on. (coughing) - [Roy] One day Israel-- - Woman, ain't you doing anything about this boy's cough? Can't you keep up with these children? - [Elizabeth] I didn't even know he had a cold. - It ain't a cold, Mom. It's just a tickle. - What is that you're putting in your mouth? - My teacher gave it to me. She said it's good for a cough. - Let me see that thing. Look at that. A half-naked woman on the tin. That's good for the cough, I suppose, hmm? What white people don't waste good money on. Just fix this boy some hot tea with lemon. That's the way you cure a cold. As for this thing, throw this in the trash. (sighing) Bible reading is over for tonight, but it was not very satisfactory. Next Sunday, I want us to do better. All of us, you understand? - Yes, sir. - All right, now don't forget to say your prayers. - We won't. (sighing) - I am not a well woman. My time here is short. - [Gabriel] I promise, Mama. - Him and his damn Bible. Next thing you know, she gonna be having a baby. - [John] What are you talking about? - Didn't you hear him praying this morning for a little voyager soon to be among us? - No. - That's how it works. First they read the good book, then fight, after that have a baby. - Why don't you shut up when you don't know what you talking about? - Wait a while. You'll hear that bed in there making all kind of noise. Hey look at this! (light saxophone music) I wish I was over there. - Oh you're disgusting. - Why it's only natural. Bible even says so. (laughing) That man sure know how to live. - Elizabeth, you know I've got to be up before six in a morning. You gonna stay out there all night? - Oh Lord, Gabriel, let's end this night with some quiet, just for once, please. Remember, I've got to get up early in the morning, too. - Come here. - [Elizabeth] What? - You know as soon as I leave, you gonna jump back in this bed, ain't you? - You don't know what I'm gonna do. (chuckling) - Well you better be thinking about me. - Why? What's so good? - What's so good? - [Elizabeth] Yeah. - [Gabriel] What's so good? - [Elizabeth] Mm-hmm. - Come here, I'll tell you. - [Elizabeth] Tell me. - It's a little secret I got. - [Elizabeth] Mm-hmm. - Come here. (whispering) (laughing) (thunder crashing) - [Mother] Letting the devil get into my house. Stealing my children. - Gabriel? What's the matter, honey? (thunder crashing) - Gotta go. Can't stay here no more. (suspenseful orchestral music) Can't live like this no more. (thunder crashing) (panting) (wind howling) Lord God have mercy on my soul! (thunder crashing) - [Mother] Let me see you on the path of righteousness before I go. - [Gabriel] I promise, Mama. You'll see. (breathing heavily) (gasping) (grunting) - Gabriel? Gabriel? You really gonna preach tomorrow? After working yourself to death on this place all week? - With the Lord's help. Think you can make yourself free to come? - I don't know. I might try, Reverend. - Well that's all the Lord asks, is that we try. And the Lord, true to his word destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah with a earthquake, and flood, and fire. (all shouting) The question for the day is, suppose I said supposed the Lord came down here right now, would we be able to deliver him 10 righteous souls? Would we be able to deliver him 10 holy people? Would we be able to deliver him 10 young people of life everlasting? And would we, I said would we would we perish in sin and damnation forever? Amen! Amen! (all applauding) (all shouting) - Preached today like you've got the call, son. Got to get the fire. Got to pray to the Lord to put his fire in your soul. - I will pray, sir. I will. Because I intend to serve the Lord with all my might. - Got to want to carry his word. - I do. - Got to feel his power. - I do. - Then God is going to make you a man among men. - Reverend Joshua. - Wait a minute, sister, I'll walk with you. - I see you're keeping company with the good sister. Too bad that poor child all choked up from white man's milk. No colored man ever gonna let her taste his richer, sweeter substance. I'll hold you in my prayers, brother. - Your mama would have been so proud of you this morning. (laughing) I wish she could have lived to see it. - It took a long time, sister, but there ain't no shelter against the Lord. - No. You've got to be the word, and the gates of Hell can't stand against it. - Just say in the word, little sister and the windows of Heaven gonna open up and shower down blessings upon you. - Oh, they already has, Reverend. God blessed me when he saved your soul, and called you to preach. - Sister, all that sinful time, was you praying for me? - We sure was, me and your mother, we was praying all the time. - Sister? The Lord done lay something on my heart that I want to share with you. And I want you to take it to the Lord in prayer. - Oh I will, Reverend. (light orchestral music) - Sister, the Lord done led me to ask you to be my wife. - Me? How? Me? - He wants you to be my holy health mate. You ain't scared, is you? You ain't got nothing to be scared of. - No. I ain't scared. - Bless you, sister. God bless you. For God. - [Woman] God. - I say, God. God. God. God sent, God sent his only begotten son. God sent his only begotten son that you and I might have a chance at everlasting life. God sent his son so that you and I could wipe out this sin. God sent his son, who carried the cross, for you and me. Amen. (all shouting) Sin! - [Man] Preach the word! - Sin! Sin! - [Man] Preach! (interposing voices) - Just thought I'd had me a little drink while I was waiting for you to lock up. I hope you don't mind, Reverend. - You's done made up your mind to serve Satan all your days, ain't you? - I made up my mind to live all I can, while I can. With the Emersons gone, we got three days of just the two of us. Just you and me here by ourselves. I intend to enjoy it. - Girl, Don't you believe in God? - No, pretty man. What I believe in is me and you. And the way you been looking at me when you think I ain't been noticing. Don't be afraid, preacher man. What you feeling is natural. I feel it too. - Esther, but I can't. I'm not allowed. - Hush. Listen to my heart. It's pounding so fast. Listen, yours is pounding too. - Esther, please. Please. - Turn down the light, Gabriel. We got a nice moon in the sky. God's smiling on us. I know he is. (wind howling) (thunder crashing) (all shouting) - Wipe your sin. Your sins every time. What they question. Satan, God will knock him down. (all shouting) Amen. I want you to know. I want you to know I'm telling Satan, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus. I rebuke you, Satan, in the name of Jesus. (all shouting) I rebuke you in the name of Jesus. Get back. Get back. Get back. Get back, Satan. Get out of here, Satan, (all shouting) - You got the fire, son. You got the fire. - [Gabriel] Thank you, sir. Thank you. - God bless you sister. - Thank you. I know I ain't been a real wife to you, Reverend, and I'm sorry. - It's all right. - I want to be. And I try, but every time we get started, I see those white men and I remember that night. - It's all right, Sister. These things take time. - But I want to be your whole and proper wife. - You are my proper wife. God put us together, and ain't nothing going to pull us apart. - I hope so. - I promise. (light orchestral music) God takes care of it all. The saints as well as the sinners in his own good time. Now let's get on to bed. I gotta work tomorrow. - [Both] I love the Lord because he has heard my voice and my supplication. - There go elementary. - I kinda like Elijah. I see him at service all the time. He's so nice. - Watch this. - Oh, no, please. - [Roy] Hey Ella Mae! - Hi Joshua. How you doing? (laughing) That brother of yours. I'm gonna get him one of these days. (all murmuring) - Morning, class. - [All] Morning. - Which one of you is John Grimes? John Grimes? - John, you hard your name called. Why don't you answer? - I'm sorry. - Did you write this essay? The history of New York through one native's eyes? - Yes, sir. - Well, I want to know it's an excellent essay. God, it's work like this that makes me proud to be principal of this school. If you'll step up here Mr. Grimes, I'd like you to meet Mr. Walter North from the Board of Education. He came by here today especially to present you with a certificate for your essay. It's a certificate from the mayor himself, John. - So John, have you been writing all along or is this your very first real essay? - No, sir. I've been writing and reading lots ever since I was a child. - So is that what you want to do? You want to be a writer, John? - I don't know. - John's father is a minister. A deacon in his church. - Temple of the Fire Baptized. - He must be a fine man to have a son like you. John, we're proud of you. - Thank you. ♪ Follow me to the bottom of the sea ♪ ♪ While you're there - Hey! Little John! Congratulations on that thing! I heard about it. All right. You should be proud of yourself. (chuckling) Good. I'm proud of you. See you at service, man. - [John] Thank you. (laughing) - [Man] Man, layup, layup, man. - [Kid] Come on, let's go. - [Man] Pass me the ball. (grunting) - [Kid] Man, over here, man. Come on. - [Man] Here we are the station. Four of us here in the broadcast booth. (John laughing) Oh, we haven't got much time. - Evening, sir. - John. Turn that thing off. I'm tired. I don't need all that noise in my ear. - Evening, Gabriel. - [Gabriel] Mm-hmm. - You ready for dinner, or you wanna rest for a spell? - Just let me catch my breath, Elizabeth. I'll eat in a while. - Well it's ready when you ready. John? You seen Roy? - [John] He's out on the fire escape. - [Elizabeth] Lord, if I told that boy once, I've told him a hundred times! I don't want him out there! - Oh, God. (sighing) - [Florence] This here's my brother I been telling you about. Gotta be mighty careful what we say, because he's a preacher. - [Gabriel] Oh, no reason to be afraid of me. I'm just a weak vessel in the hands of the Lord. - Now you see what I'm talking about? Here's Johnny. Johnny, shake hands with the preacher. - Hey! What a fine looking boy. - I'll go get us some coffee. - [Gabriel] Your husband must be a very handsome man. - His father isn't alive. - Oh I see. Well I'm sorry, but with a fine son like this, the Lord will surely bless you. - John, why don't you show your father the prize you got in school today? - No, Mama, not now. He just came in, and he's too tired. - Oh go on. He'll want to see it. He likes to know we have bright children too. - All right. (John sighing) - [Gabriel] Come in. - [John] I got something from school today, and Mom said I should show you. - [Gabriel] Well, just don't stand there. Bring it here. History of New York, huh? - I wrote it over and over again, and I had to read a lot of books about it. - Might have been nice if you'd written something about the Bible. Something about your own people, and God. - I will next time, sir. - Listen boy, sit down. When the white man start giving us prizes, I've got to ask myself, what is he after? White man's been our torment for over 100 years. Anything he do, everything he try is a way of beating us down, keeping us small. You don't believe me, do you? John, just read the newspapers. Or just look around you. Right here in Harlem. So when I see something like this, I can't rejoice and feel glad. I got to know that he's up to some kind of new trick. So you just take this thing, and give it back to your teacher. - Gabriel! Gabriel! You determined to ignore me, ain't you? - Esther, Please I got work to do. - I have to talk to you. - Look, what happened between us was as while ago. It's over, so let's leave it be. - That's what I'm trying to tell you, man. It ain't over. We still got another little chapter we got to deal with. - Esther, please. - Gabriel, I'm going have a baby. - What? - It's the God's truth, Gabriel. I'm gonna have a baby. (dramatic orchestral music) - Baby. How come you so sure it's mine? - I ain't in the habit of lying, Gabriel. And I ain't been with so many mens I's likely to get confused. This is your baby, whether you want it or not, this baby's yours! - All right, you ain't gotta shout. - I can see you don't want me. And I ain't likely to be with no man that don't want me. So I been figuring. - Yeah? - Maybe I could go away. Go someplace where me and my baby could be loved and appreciated. But I'm gonna need some money, and I ain't got any. You got some money, Gabriel? Is this all there is? - It's all I could get. - I'll have to make due. You know, I made a mistake. That mistake was you. I know what we done was natural. If it's a sin, then I'll go down to Hell and pay for it. But least ways, I'll be bringing up my baby to be a good man. He ain't listening to no preacher, and he ain't never setting foot in a church. (men chattering) - Roy. Roy! I'm talking to you, boy. Come here. What are you doing running with that no count trash. - What's it to you, Reverend Grimes. - You don't intend to show nobody no kind of respect, ever, do you? - I respect those who respect me. - [Gabriel] Have I ever talked ugly to you? - I don't even know why you talk to me at all? - I knew your mother, son. We used to work together up at the Emerson place you know-- - [Royal] What that got to do with me? - I take an interest in you. - Save your time, Reverend Grimes. Ain't nothing to me to take interest in. - Child, all parents have high hopes for their children. Why your mother's dead, God rest his soul, but your father, maybe your father's still alive. - Well if he is, he's a thousand miles away, so he don't count for much, now do he? Now save your time, Reverend Grimes. I've got places to go, and things to do. - [Gabriel] Royal. Royal. - [Royal] That old man is getting to me man, I don't know. He's getting to me. - [Esther] He ain't gonna me listening to no preaching. If he don't do nothing but drink whiskey all day long, he'll be a better man than his daddy ever was. (door slamming) - Put that thing out. Daddy's home and if he smells it, we both catch it. - Between you, and Daddy, and Mama, of course I can't have no fun in this house. But at least you ain't my boss. - Who did this? - How should I know? - Okay. Where's my knife? - That's none of your business. - I woke on the morning of my 14th birthday with the feeling that something important had happened or was about to happen. Morning, Mama. - Well, sleepy head. - [John] Ah, what's for breakfast? - About time you was getting up. - What you think's for breakfast? You got a special need for something? - What is it with you? Did I say something to you? - Oh excuse me. - Don't let Roy bother you. He crossed his two sticks this morning. - I asked you a question, Mama. You didn't give me no answer. - Oh yes, you want an answer, do you? Well, your father only spanks you when he thinks it's necessary. Keep you from growing wild like all those people we see on the street everything. - I see people on the street too. - Roy. - And they all ain't drunks and thieves like you say. Most of them go to work, and come home, and laugh and talk, and don't have beat up on one another, or read the Bible all the time. - Roy, you know and I know that there ain't no safety unless you walk with the Lord. And your Father know it. That's why he worries about you. Else he's let you go down to Hell where it looks like you determined to go anyhow. Or ride on until somebody puts a knife in you, or takes you off to jail. - I ain't looking to go to no jail. You think that's all there is in the world. Jails. Churches. - Mama? - Yes, John? - Is Daddy a good man? - Now what kind of questions is that? You don't know no better man. You children are young. You don't know how lucky you are to have a father that worries about you and tries to see that you come home all right. - Yeah, we sure is lucky we have a father that won't let us go to no movies, play on no streets, don't want us to do nothing, except go to church and read that old Bible. - Hush up, boy. Let me see you do some eating. - I'm eating, I'm eating. - And when you're finished, I got work for both of you. - Work? - [Elizabeth] This is Saturday, ain't it? - [Roy] What you think today's something special? - You sweep out the front room, like a good boy and dust off the furniture. And Roy, you clean you all's room. I want this whole place clean when your father comes home, you hear me? (light jazz music) Nearly finished John? - [John] Yes'm, almost. - You know you're your Mama's right hand man. I never did ask you what you wanted for your birthday, but I ain't never forgot it. Go and get yourself something you really want. - Thank you, Mama. I knew you'd remember. - Son? Make it special. - With a fine son like this, the Lord will surely bless you. He'll open up the windows of Heaven for you and your son. Gonna pour down blessings, until you won't know where to put them all. You mark my words. (upbeat jazz music) - [John] The sky that led downtown was bringing us the city, the shining city which I had looked at with a longing from afar. Today I, I sensed again it's richness and variety, and I knew someday it would be mine. It would take me to it's heart, and reveal mysteries my eyes had never seen. Among it's wonders were the movie palaces my father forbid us to enter, where Satan beckoned in the silver images. But today was my birthday. My 14th birthday. And it was special. - I love that music. Whenever I hear it, I think of you, how pale you are. How strange. How cold. - You are going it. You always order champagne? - [Man] No. - [Woman] Then why'd you do it now? - I was hoping it would make you more friendly. Do you think it will? - Well, there's one thing I can say for you, gentleman in every sense of the word. (light jazz music) (light jazz music) - Please get up. You're making a fool of yourself, and a fool of me. - [Woman] I can't go on like this. - You disgust me. - You won't have none of me, because you're a monster! You know what you are you give me-- (light jazz music) (kids chattering) - Yeah, man. John, man. Dude John. Hey John, man. Your brother got hurt real bad today. They been looking for you. They cut him up real bad. Just like that, you know. I ran after I saw that. - We been wondering where you was, boy. Your brother done gone out and got his-self hurt. - Give me the peroxide, woman. - Oh, Lord. - Now that's gonna sting for a little bit but-- - Don't hurt him. - [Gabriel] It's all right. Just hold still. - [Royal] Ah! - It's all right. Don't you have sense enough to come home when you're needed? There, it's going to be all right. There. There, it's all over now, see? You a brave boy. Couple more inches and it could have been this boy's eye. Now I got some questions for you about why you let this boy go out of here and get his-self killed. - Gabriel, I didn't even know he had gone out. - Didn't know? - One minute-- - Didn't know? Well what kind of woman are you? - You ain't got no right to say them things to this woman! - I am talking to my wife. - Florence! - [Florence] Blaming this woman because this boy has got a head as hard as his father just ain't right. - All I know is that I come home and find my son hurt and bleeding and nobody's got any explanation as to why. - We told you, Gabriel. - What? - [Elizabeth] He went out with out permission. He went out with a gang to fight some white boys. - Yeah. Mama didn't know. (sighing) - Gabriel, you gonna make me do something. - What? - You gonna make me call you out for what you really are. - Call me out for who? What are you talking about, woman? - Don't worry. I know what I'm saying. You always talking about setting an example. Well what do you think these children are seeing? - What they see is a poor man trying to serve his lord, because that's my life. - And I guarantee you they gonna do their best to keep it from being their life. - She's talking gibberish. Look here. Come here. I want you to see what them people have done to your brother. Almost took out his eyes. Them white people that you love so much. - Yes, and he was trying to take out theirs. - Woman, don't you ever stop? I mean, can't you see this boy is hurt? - Yes. But it was his fault, but you don't want to admit that. - Are you not gonna stop putting your mouth in my business until I slap you upside your head? - Slap? - [Gabriel] That's right. - Slap me? - [Elizabeth] Wait! - Do you know who you talking to? - Don't force me, woman. - You slap me, and I guarantee you, you won't do no more slapping, brother. - What you should be doing is telling this boy, this is what whites do to blacks. - Oh, I swear to God that boy was in a fight, and he got his-self hurt. - It looks like neither one of you care whether he lives or dies. - Now that ain't fair, Gabriel. He's my son too. I love him just as much as you do. - Then why don't you take care of him? - I don't know how you expect me to take care of this place and keep running around the block, looking after this boy. No. I can't stop him, and you can stop him neither. And that's why you keep trying to fix the blame on everybody, but there ain't nobody to blame. He's just got a wild streak in him, and we better pray to God he lose it, before the next person puts a knife in him that puts him in his grave. - Woman, you better watch how you talking to these children-- - Gabriel, it's the truth-- - You give me respect in my house. You hear me? - [Elizabeth] Gabriel. - You give me respect! - You black bastard! You slap my mother again, I swear to God I'll kill you! - You say what? You curse and disrespect me? - Gabriel. Gabriel let us-- - [Gabriel] Let go of me, woman. - Gabriel, please. - [Gabriel] I'm gonna teach this boy a lesson he's not gonna forget in a long time. - [Elizabeth] Gabriel, please! - [Gabriel] Never forget! - Gabriel, please! Gabriel! Gabriel, stop it! Stop it! Gabriel! Gabriel, you is wild! Stop it! Stop it! Gabriel, stop it! Stop it, stop it, brother. Stop it Gabriel. You ain't gonna change nothing. You can't take the whole world with you. And you ruined one family, don't ruin this one. (breathing heavily) (door slamming) (dramatic orchestral music) (panting) (muttering) (guns firing) - Hey, come here, boy. Did you hear what I said? I said come here, boy. - I ain't no boy. You looking at a man, and when you talk to me as one, then I'll come to you. - What'd you say, nigger? - [Man] Calm down and wait a minute, now. That negro, Grimes, is a preacher man. - [Man] He's got a mighty smart tongue for a nigger. - Hey, hey. Go on home, Gabriel. Go on now. - [Gabriel] Boy, what do you think you're doing out here? - Ain't nothing to be scared of, Reverend. They done got their nigger for tonight. - They intend to get another one. Now you hurry along home. - No, I ain't going home tonight. I'm taking a train out of here. I'm going to Chicago. Royal, a-- - Hey, ain't got no time to talk. Get on the move, I'm a catch that train. - Royal, go with God. - Oh, yeah. Except, I'm traveling light. (light humming) (screaming) - It's my grand baby! (crying) They killed him! My baby! He's gone! (gasping) It's my grand baby! (whimpering) - The boy is dead. Esther's son, Royal. Somebody put a knife in his throat. Tried to tell me that he was gambling, but I don't believe that. It was them. One of them whites killed him. - [Elizabeth] Oh my Lord. Seemed like that boy been doomed right from the start. - Just last night. Just last night, he was telling me about all of his plans. I tried to tell him. I tried to talk to him, and, but even then it was too late. - [Deborah] Too late for what, Gabriel? - It was too late for everything. - That boy was kin to you, wasn't he? - What? - [Deborah] He was your flesh and blood. - Yes, he was my son. - And you sent that girl away with the money out of that box. - Yes. Yes. - Oh, Gabriel. Why you do it? Why you send her off by herself and you didn't say nothing? Oh honey, I ain't never asked, but I've got a right to know. - I asked my God over and over again to forgive me, but I didn't want no harlot's son. - Esther weren't no harlot. - She weren't my wife, and I couldn't make her my wife, now could I? I mean where could I have gone with Esther? And me, a preacher. - Gabriel, all these years, I been praying to the Lord to touch my body, and make me like other women because I know you wanted a son. But it just wasn't his will. But I don't understand. When that poor child died, why didn't we take him and raise him as our own? Why didn't you say something? I wouldn't have cared what folks said, or where we might have had to go. I would have raised him as my own. And we would have had a son. - I'm down in a hole, old lady. Don't dig me no deeper. - I've been thinking, you better commence to tremble when the Lord give you your heart's desire. I know I been wanting you since I wanted anything. And then I got you. - Woman, do you know how low you brought me tonight? - What? - God, how far do I have to go to be free from your sin? - Ain't my sin that's holding you. I ain't the one that's got the chains. - And that boy of yours, he don't count for nothing? - We have two sons, and both of them are equal. I make no difference between them, and you ain't going to neither. - Even though one of them was born from sin? - You can't make me sorry I bore Johnny, I done told you that a hundred times! I don't repent what I did in love. - Oh, woman. You better pray loud tonight, because you've got a lot to answer for. - We all do, Gabriel. - You ain't so holy, either. - [Gabriel] Are you talking to me? - You broke your word. Broke the promise that you made to God, to Johnny and me. You said you'd bring him up as you're own, treat him equal, and be a father to him. But you ain't done none of that, Gabriel. Every time that child looks to you, you treat him cold and hard. He can't do nothing right for you, and he tries. God knows he tries. I ain't gonna stand for it no more. If you don't make good to your promise, you and I are gonna have words about what we doing, living together. - [Gabriel] Are you hearing what you're saying? - Yes. - And you ain't afraid of what I might do? - No. (door clicking) - [Gabriel] John? - Yes, sir? - [Gabriel] Shouldn't you be down at church, preparing for Tara's service? - Yes, sir. (knocking on door) - [Elijah] Well, well, little John. It's nice of you to come. seeing as how I'm almost finished. - I told you before, I don't like you calling me names. - What kind of names? Little? I'm warning you, Elijah. - Hey, what's the matter? You in some kind of mood or something? - Why don't you just leave me alone. - Hey, what if I don't want to? - Look, we're here to put out chairs, so why don't we just do that? - Not until you answer me. What's wrong? - What are you hard of hearing? I said leave me alone. - Then why don't you make me? I mean, you supposed to be so big and strong. Don't like nobody calling you little. Why don't you show me how tough you is. - You want me to show you? - Yeah. I wanna see. I wanna see. Can you get up? - No. - Now what you gonna do? You wrapped like a little snake. (grunting) Can you get up? Huh, huh? - No. - Are you gonna give, John? - Go to hell! - Strong as a mule, and twice as stubborn. What you say? (gasping) Huh? - Will we be even then? - I didn't hurt you or nothing, did I? - No. I just had to catch my breath was all. - Pretty strong for your size. - Why don't you teach me how to wrestle? - No. You strong enough already. You was pretty angry about something. It was nothing I did, was it? - No. - I'm glad because you my friend. I don't want nothing to hurt you. - I don't want to be no preacher. - What you saying, John? - I don't wanna live my life in no church. - [Elijah] Preaching and spreading the word of God is the greatest thing a man can do in his life. - My father's a preacher, and I don't want to be like him. - Your father is a good man. - That's what you think. - He may be hard, but he's righteous. (knocking on door) - Praise the Lord. - Praise the Lord Mrs. McCain's. (interposing voices) - Huh, is we the first? - No. Me and brother Johnny here already done some cleaning up this evening. - Oh, brother Johnny is mighty faithful. The Lord is going to work something out mighty big for you. Just mark my words. - Brother Johnny ain't even saved yet. - Is Father James going to come out and be with us tonight? - I don't reckon so. He be saving his strength for the morning service. - [Woman] Oh, yes he's a praying man. The Lord done blessed us with a good shepherd. Oh, he's mighty hard, but then the word is hard. - [Elijah] He made me know that. - Yes, I guess you could say so. Don't look to me like nobody else is coming. - Oh don't be of such little faith. Son, ain't your Daddy gonna come out and be with us tonight? - Yes, ma'am. He said so. - And your mama. Ain't she coming too? - I don't know. She's been feeling tired. - She ain't so tired she can't come and pray a little while. - I reckon we ought to start a song. I sure hate to walk into a church where folks are sitting and talking. Ah, that just kills my spirit. - [Woman] Amen - [Elijah] Praise the Lord, Sister. - Yes. Sister Ella, will you help me to sing this song?

Oh it must be hard on you. - Sometimes. But I have Johnny for company. At least I know there's somebody there who need me when I walk in the door. - Now girl, you're still a young woman. Don't you be in no rush to get no new husband. Ain't a nigger been born knows how to treat a woman. At least ain't never found him. I was with Frank for ten years, and he ain't never learned how to be no kinda husband. - Richard wasn't like that. He was a man so full of love for me. - [Florence] What happened? - Trouble with the police. - [Florence] Was he a criminal? - No. They took him for one because he was black. When they found out their mistake, it was already too late. He'd been in their prison for 30 days, and when he came out, he just didn't want to live. Not even for me. And then he killed himself. (sobbing) - And he didn't even marry you. Oh. Gabriel. - Florence. - So you came? - Yes, the Lord brought me safe. - Well come on in. - I want to start me a new life. You know, after Deborah died, that was the end of it. So now, I want to start over someplace new and fresh. Because everything I ever knew and loved down there is dead and buried. - Except me. Oh! There's my baby! Hello! Elizabeth, this here's my brother I been telling you about. He's a preacher, so we gotta be careful what we say around here. - No reason to be afraid of me, I'm just a weak vessel in the hands of the Lord. - You see what I'm talking about? Johnny, shake hands with the preacher. (laughing) - [Gabriel] Blessed Jesus. - I'll go fix us some coffee. - What a fine looking boy. With a fine son like this, the Lord will surely bless you.

(laughing) See you all later, Sister Grimes, Sister Elizabeth. - Bye, Elijah. - Praise the Lord, Brother John. - Sure you don't want to come up for some breakfast? - No, child, I should be home resting in my bed. That's just where I'm gonna go. I'll see you. Now I want you to fight the good fight, you hear me? Don't you get scared. Don't you lose your nerve. Because the Lord has put his hands on you. I knew there was a reason why I should have come to church last night. - I'll see you later. - Bye. Bye, Bye, Gabriel. - Boy, what are you doing up? - What took you all so long? - Just get on back inside. - But Mama. - [Elizabeth] Go on. - [Gabriel] John? - Yes, sir? - Aw, nothing. Go on in. John? I want to tell you something. Son, you did it tonight, didn't you? Climbed up that mountain. - Yes, sir. - But you've got to understand, son. That mountain is very high, and it's got many peaks. And I'm gonna try to help you get over those peaks. Every man should do it for himself. I mean, nobody can do it for him. - [John] Yes, sir. - And it ain't going to be easy, but I'm gonna try to help you. I'm gonna try. - [John Voiceover] Standing there that morning, each of us wanted to speak some final, some living word that would conquer the great division between us. - Come on, let's go in and get some breakfast. - [John] And though my father tried, he could not find that word. And in his absence, something died in me. But something also came alive, something that gave me the new words. I'm ready. I'm coming. I'm on my way. (light gospel music) (vocalizing)
