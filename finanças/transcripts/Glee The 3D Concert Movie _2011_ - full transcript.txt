I love Glee! My favorite character would be Rachel. Yeah, the best character is Rachel. Because she was very Barbra Streisand-esque. Well, I'm warming up before the show. I generally start with a lukewarm cup of hot water with lemon and honey. It can't be too hot because it will hurt your vocal chords. My favorite character is Firm. Blaine. He is so adorable. I just love him to death. My favorite character is Brittany, because she's so dumb. But she's so pretty and she can dance so well. I think it has a lot to do with my hair, because look at how long it is and how beautiful it is. My favorite character is Sam because he's really cute. Finn! I think the hottest character is definitely Santana. I ingest l.3\iSS€. It's normally supposed to be applied on your lids to make your lashes grow. I just took it one step further and started drinking it. Puck! Puck! Rachel! Rachel! Meme. maine. Acrually, maine. Sam. Sam. No, Puck. Puck. He's so funny. He's super, super cocky and just totally into himself I heard that this haircut might make me go a little faster, have a little edge on the competition. And, you know, the ladies like something to grab on to, time and time again. Artie, for me, because he makes looking geeky look so cool. It's crazy because I can't believe that people actually like us enough that we could make a 3-D movie. I'd have to go with Blaine. Definitely Blaine. We've gone from Lima, Ohio, to Dublin, Ireland. And we've done four countries. And it's just been an amazing experience. That means my face is going to be in 3-D. And my pimples. Sam! Finn. Everyone is my favorite, I can't choose just one. I like Quinn because she's really hot. I need more... Could you turn the camera off? I need.,. Oh, God. 3-D? Kurt is my favorite character. I love his sassiness and how he's not afraid to tell it exactly how ii is. Thank you for loving me. But I want to thank everybody who has been with me since day one. All my Glee Club members and Mr. Schue. We made it.

I think it's made me accept myself better. I like performing, but I was never comfortable doing ii. I have three daughters, two boys, and we all watch Glee every week. And it gave us all something in common. Everybody watches Glee. It doesn't matter what race, gender, what your sexuality is. Anybody can be a Glee fan. It inspires me that you could write your own life story no matter who you are. Glee has definitely changed the way that I look at certain groups of people. And short people and tall people and fat people and skinny people, really popular and nerdy people. The clique that I hang out with is the jock clique. I guess il could be the popular clique, also. I would say I am a real life Cheerio, but I'm not a stuck-up Cheerio. But I am a Cheerio because I am a cheerleader. Here we go. Ready? Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Coach Page, she is Sue Sylvester. Let's do it for Sue. Janae is our secret weapon, and when we went to Nationals, people underestimated our squad because we had her. And she was the one who actually saved our routine. She can go pretty high. She's small, but she's like a little ball. I would say I'm popular because I am different. Everyone does know me. I stand out. Go, team Gleei I know you know this one. Rocks in the sky! Get them up. Let's go! Bounce With me. BOUNCE With me! Hey! Hey! Up top. Let's go!

My favorite character would have to be Brittany. Brittany, Brittany. I hope they have an overwhelming sensation about my boobs in Slave because they are 3-D and they look really good. My favorite character is Brittany S. Pierce. I'm the biggest Glee fan in the world. I'm getting a Glee tattoo. My cat's name is Santana, my dog's name is Brittany, I'm wearing Glee shoes, I have a Cheerios jacket, my entire house is Glee, and my car was named Quinn until I crashed it. This is Brittany's hat from Blame It. I have definitely made friends because of Glee. It's changed my whole social life. And it'S Off. Lt'S Still On. - Am I a girl? - Yes. Am I 3 student? No. Am I Gwyneth Paltrow? No, not in this. Am I a guy? No. A gm? Yes! Ready, Jackie? Go. Am I blonde? Yeah. Am I Quinn? NO. Am l Brittany? Yeah! I got the Brittany card? Yes. Okay, Ican't believe I just got the Brittany card! Okay. What did she do? I don't care. I got the Brittany card! I've never got it on my own without cheating. Itls a huge thing for me, honestly, to have people over and in my house because / HSVSf' had that before. It makes me feel normaf. I was 15 years old when I was diagnosed with Asperger's. It's common to have anxiety, panic, any kind of just "meltdowns," is what we usually call them. The more you get to know me, the more obvious it is. It's just like this crazy madness in my mind. But I do have one thing that is my pick-me-up and gets me through it, and that's Brittany S. Pierce. Brittany has, what we like to call, "The Brittany Effect" on me. When I see a Brittany video, it's like something switches in me, and I'm happy. I am the biggest Brittany fan. I will fight for that. There 's no doubt about ft! My dog is named Brittany. Come on! I know I may be young But I've got feelings, too And I need to do what I feel like doing So let me go, and just listen All you people look at me like I'm a little girl Well, did you ever think it'd be okay For me to step into this worfd?

Pretty young thing Thank you, Mike! I'm a very judgmental person, and at first glance I could dehnitely write somebody off And Glee has taught me that everybody has a story. GIRL 22 /think that we're the majority. We 're the quirky, weird kids. We don? all look the same way. I've been the shy kid always. And especially Kurt being so out and being able to just be him, and be trendy and fashionable, it really helped me kind of want to just be me a little bit more. I can connect with Kurt on a very personal level. I came out when I was in eighth grade. And I'm like, "I can go through the same thing as he does." So it's like real life. Well, in the first semester of eighth grade, my whole life changed dramatically. I did not come out by choice at all. I had a journal. My journal was someone that wasn't going to judge me, no matter what I told it. I! Wouldjusf listen. I had this crush on this guy named Brian. He had the most gorgeous eyes ever. I wrote many letters to him that I would never give him. It would start off with, "Brian, hi. "I know we don't talk very often, "but I've liked you since the seventh grade." Bfiafl foUI"ld OUT that l had 3 crush on l'1il'T'l because my best friend at the time took my journal, and set it on his desk during class. And he just opened it and just started reading everything. Everymmg_ And IW3S So €IT1b3ff3SS€d. Ain? no way For me to love you If you won't let me No I know that a woman's duty is to help and love a man And that's the way it was planned I said stop trying to be Someone you're not And if you need me to love you Say, say you do Oh then, baby, baby Baby, don't you know that I need you?

Yeah, I'm the only cheerleader in top five. isn't that crazy? I'm so excited. You haven't showed me a picture of him yet. I was like, "What'?" H€'S CUTS. This yean I'm going to prom with Reed Cook. He's known for just being fun. And he's a football player. He's of average stature. Yeah, he's handsome. I don't usually go to dances with average-sized guys. I usually go with a little person. I was looking for a date to prom and I olidn't know who to ask. And Janae has been telling me, "Coach, "I don't have anybody to goto prom." Because I was like, "It would be fun to go with him." I was just throwing it out there as, like, "Wouldn't that be COOI?" Thinking it would never, ever happen. Artie, he's in a wheelchain he's got two girls. Finn and Rachel, she's a nerd, he's a jock, it worked out. Puckerman and Zizes, she's big, he doesn't care. He likes hen And Janée, she's small, but I don? Care. I don't think that Should matter. She's just a fun person to be around. I was kind Of afraid to 63.3 hef. I was nervous. I didn't know if she'd say yes or no. Just one day during the break, I decided, "if I'm going to do it, I've got to do it right now." And Reed came walking up. I was just like, "I think it might happen." And he got down on one knee, and he just asked me to prom right then and there. She was... I don't know. She was surprised, definitely surprised. She didn? know if I was serious or not. Until I was like, "Yeah, will you goto prom with me?" Said ii a couple of more times, but... I was just like, "Yeah. "Because I was so nervous, also. I never thought I had any chance in the world to have him ask me to prom. Do you ever feel like a plastic bag Drifting through the wind Wanting to start again?

He was the first one out. And he took the notebook with him, actually. He shared my journal with everyone. I felt like everyone was looking at me differently already. They all knew. It spread like wildfire. And when I heard that, I never wanted to come back to the school. And that was on a Monday. At the end of the day, I got my journal back, and I wanted to rip it up because I didn't want my family to Hnd out about me. But l just thought they would still Hnd it, So I decided to burn if insfead. That's when lbecame very bottled in, even when people teased me and made fun of me throughout the year. And, it'S just hard because WS hafd I0 deal with it. lt'S hard. Kurt taught me a lot because he was the only out kid at his school, And he was proud. And just like in the prom episode, he did go off running, but he came back, and he held his head up and smiled. The SUI? is shining Come on get happy Shout it now, there's no one The lord is waiting Who can doubt it now To take your hand Shout hallelujah So let's tell the world And just get happy About it now We're going to the promised land Happy days are here again We 're heading across the river Soon your cares will all be gone There 'H be no more From now on Forget your troubles Happy days And just get happy Are here again YOU beffef chase The Skies All your blues away Above are clear again Shout hallelujah So /et's sing a song And just get happy Of cheer again Happy times Happy nights Happy days Are Here Again Is it true that you told Mercedes that you sing better than her? Yes, because l UO. But that's okay. Mercedes, what do you think about this? She doesn't have to answer that if she doesn't want to. Well, I'm going to lock her in a closet. I mean, who even would try? Do you see her? Is it war, Rachel? No. She might act like she's all nice and fu n-spirited and whatnot. I can't even say these words because my ears are too innocent. I was minding my own business. I just decided to go for a stroll on stage, sing a song. When, out Of nowhere a woman that looked like she should have been caged in the zoo had somehow escaped and grabbed me with her giant bear hands. You wanna make out? Brittany, are you flirting with my man? Tina. I just want to push her. She doesn't want to get a smackdown. She's afraid of the wrath. She knows what I've done to people. I've beaten you up. I've beat her up. It's kind of crazy. I thought I would be super famous. And it happened. I'm just really thankful because somebody has to compete with Kurt. Everybody's got a dream.

We honestly danced the night away. It was just fun because I dance like a maniac. And so does Reed, actually. It's 10:30, so half-an-hour until they announce Prom Princess. Oh, no. Okay, now you have me nervous. They lined us up, and we were standing backstage. And my stomach, like, kind of IIJITISU il'1fO Kl'10\S and I just got butterflies. And, last but not least, we have Anthony Banas and Janae Meraz. And your Prince and Princess are... Haden BSFFOW and Janie IVI€F3Z. I was really shocked. And so, I was just like, "Did they mess up, or is that actually me?" And then they came and they put in on my head. And I was like, "Oh! It'S me!" Congratulations, guys. COACH PAGES She has tons of friends. And I have absolutely no idea why nobody who is an average-sized person HBS HSVEI' taken hef tO B UBHCS. But Reed didn 'I think twice. He absolutely didn't think twice. I think, for the Hrs! time, he proved to her that people see her as just her, not as a fittfe person. I guess you could say Glee has changed my life, because it's opened my eyes that people are different. And l'rTl like, "l have to l'el°f18l'T1D&l' 'll'l31I." Because it's like, I know I'm different, but I'm not realizing that everyone else is different around me, also.

At the time in my life when I got into Glee, it was just hard. It was dealing with losing my father. It was dealing with the being different. Andjust so many things were happening. And she kind of just popped into my life when I needed someone, when I just felt so negative and down on myself When I met her in person, she fully embraced me and my quirks. And she Sat lhefe, and she held my hands and listened to me talk to her. I never felt more understood than in that moment when I looked her in the eye and had this conversation with her. And it was that moment I really wanted to change and be a better person, and be a positive, happy person because I looked at this girl and looked at what she had done for me in such a short time, and knew I want to be like her, and I want to be a positive light in peoples' lives. I think I have to Cry. Oh please Say to me You'f.~' fer me be your man And please Say to me You'll let me hold your hand Hi. I wanna hold your hand I wanna hold your hand And when I touch you I feel happy inside J't's such a feeling That my love I Can? hide Yeah, you You got that something I think yOU'h' understand H i, sweetie. When I Say that something I wanna hold Your hand I wanna hold your hand I wanna hold your hand I wanna hold your hand I transferred to a new school when I was a junior in high school, and I got into the theater department, and I started doing musicals. The theater department here is like Glee Club because we're a family just like Glee Club is a family. And all of us are different in some sort of way. And we all just come together as one. I actually did wish that l had someone to look up to like Kurt. I feel like if he were there, like, out, when I was in eighth grade, I could be like, "Look at him being gay, "and he stiff gets to five his dream." Butnowl'm 19-years-old and I'm all grown up, and I completely accept myself And I'm a person with no secrets now. I am open to the world, everyone. If you ask me if I'm gay, I am proud to stand up and say that, "Yes, Trenton Thompson. I am gay!" And I couldn't do that before. And now it's like I have no secrets. So if I write something down and someone finds it, it's like, "You could have just asked." I'm really not a big fan of my nose, ever since I was really young. For me it was either this or "Little One," because I'm really short. I can't sing, but I can dance. I was kind of, you know, the weirdo with red hair. For me it was either this or "Perfectionist," Mine says "Brace Face," We're Lebanese and proud. And proud. Out and proud to be Lebanese. And love softball. I wanted to be like Rachel in high school. But instead I joined the Navy, so I'm not on stage. I am obviously Brittany. Santana. We're waiting here for this girl. She just got into a car accident on the way here. And she HBS OUI' UCKEYS. It doesn't matter if you love him Or capital H-I-M My mama told me when I was young We are ah' born superstars She rolled my hair Put my lipstick on In the glass of her boudofr There's nothing wrong with loving who you are She said 'Cause he made you perfect, babe So hold your head up, girl And you'll go far Listen to me when I say I'm beautiful in my way 'Cause God makes no mistakes I'm on the right track, baby I was born this way Don't hide yourself in regret Just love yourself and you're set I'm on the right track, baby I was born this way Don't be a drag, just be a queen Whether you're broke or evergreen You're black, white, beige, chola descent You're Lebanese, you're Orient Whether life's disabilities left you outcast, bullied, or teased Rejoice and love yourself today 'Cause, baby, you were born this way No matter black, white or beige Chola or Orient-made I'm on the right track, baby I was born to be brave I'm beautiful in my way 'Cause God makes no mistakes I'm on the right track, baby I was born this way Don't hide yourself in regret Just love yourself and you're set I'm on the right track, baby I was born this way There ain't no other way Baby, I was born this way Baby, I was born this way There ain't no other way Baby, I was born this way Right track, baby I was born this way I was born this way hey I was born this way, hey I'm on the right track, baby I was born this way, hey I was born this way hey I was born this way, hey I'm on the right track, baby I was born this way, hey Glee, Glee Did they really make US do that? Did we really do that? That was too easy. I think that everyone can see themselves in the cast of Glee. I think it's really cool that people are able to peel back the layers to find something that was already there inside of them. Glee is like my medicine. It makes me happy. It puts me in a good place. It can be VSU/ difficult with Asperger's because we have major social anxiety. I wouldn't even really go to concerts or anything. I was very much a homebody. I didn? even go to schoof. Glee is the reason Igor out the door that first day, and went to my first crass. One thing I did learn is to be proud of yourself Don't be afraid. Stand up for what you believe in. For me, I'm small, so that's my challenge. Glee helps you realize that everyone goes through their own struggles. You've got to notice the little people in life. You may think that I'm a zero But, hey, everyone you wanna be probably started off like me You may think that I'm a freakshow /dOI7' [Cafe But, hey, give it just a little time I bet you're gonna change your mind All of the dirt You've been throwin' my way ff 6ff?'f SO hafd to fake Thats r/gm 'Cause I know one day You'll be SCl'63mfl1' my HEITIS And /'u jus: /ook awe y Thats r/gm Just go ahead and hate on me And run your mouth So everyone can hear Hit me with the words you got and knock me down Baby, I don't care Keep it up And soon enough you'll figure out You wanna be You wanna be A loser like me A loser like me Push me up against the locker And, hey, an 1 do is snake fr off I'll get you back when I'm your boss I'm not thinkin' 'bout you haters 'Cause, hey, I could be a superstar I'll see you when you wash my car All of the dirt You've been throwin' my way ff 6ff?'f SO hafd to fake Thats r/gm 'Cause I know one day You'll be SCl'63mfl1' my HEITIS And /'u jus: /ook awe y Thats r/gm Just go ahead and hate on me And run your mouth So everyone can hear Hit me with the worst you got and knock me down Baby, I don't care Keep it up And soon enough you'll figure out You wanna be You wanna be A loser like me Just go ahead and hate on me and run your mouth So everyone can hear Hit me with the worst you got and knock me down Baby, I don't care Keep it up And soon enough you'll figure out You wanna be You wanna be A loser like me A loser like me Like they say on the show, they are all losers, well, we're all losers, too. All these different lifestyles can actually come together. A loser like me A loser like me It gives a story to the people who don't have voice. And everyone always underestimates the nerds. But the nerds have the power, right? Nerds! Thank you so much for coming out. Thank you, guys, so much. I mean, everything that the characters go through, il's really nice to see that and have it be related lo a song. And so, it's like a playlist of my life.
