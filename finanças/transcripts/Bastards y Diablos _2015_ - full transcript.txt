So you do know my mom died? - Yeah. - I just didn't know if you got briefed on that. - Yeah, a long time ago. - Cool, I just didn't know if you knew.

So I would go like talk to middle schoolers, and so, I felt pretty strongly about that until I was like 17. So I guess my junior year. - Wow. - What do you mean, wow? - I expected, I thought I was gonna hear like 5th grade or something. Seems pretty safe. Don't you feel safe here, I feel safe. - Yeah, should I not feel safe? - No. - You tell me, should I not feel safe? - I have no idea about math, I'm not gonna lie. - Wow. - Cool.

No we're not, it's good to, I think it's good to explore the dark in every situation. So, like what are the sleeping arrangements? (crowd chanting) (jazz music) (crowd cheering) (bottle shattering) (birds chirping) - Holy shit. Wow. - You ready to go. - What are you talking about? - (foreign word) You remember, Jairo? (flamenco guitar music) (dance music) - He never bullshit. - No. - No. Never bullshit. We have bipolar. It's the sickness of the family. No pills, no pills, no. - Chemical imbalances. - No. No pills. The world is not easy, man. Your country, for example. They fucking partied, man. They fucking partied. I am not Colombian. The world is terrible. And I feel that. The world is beautiful. It's beautiful man. Alive in that. No pills man. No pills, no. - The gynecologist came, he made a test, of the placenta. The placenta was a little bit old, a little bit, just one week old. So, bring the baby through the, going through the normal delivery will make her suffer. So he decided that she will go through the C section, immediately. Okay, okay.

We have like a finca. - Trust me boys, go to Cali. - Holy shit. Thank you man. What are you drinkin'?

There must be a purpose for them, there must be a reason they're there. I mean I kept 'em for some reason. Tell you what, beats the popoyana out of me. (laughing) I love saying that. Popo means shit here. Beats the popoyana-- (laughing) - And you go, what is it all tryin' to tell you? What does it say? And I don't know. Eventually, you just go well, who knows, whatever? I don't know. Just a dumb old man. - Hey, we got ourselves a double date in Cali tomorrow. - What? - Talked to Bruni. - Yeah? The sister? - No, it's the mom. You know who dad was with.

Just like never got over it, you know. Funny, you can go through so many relationships and still go back to the same person. - She's got two daughters you said? And they're both hot? - Yeah man, they're both hot. Both really hot. I sort of had a thing with Costanza. - [Dion] What's the other one's name? (muffled speaking) - Chantal. - You think Chantal would like the blue, or would she appreciate the green? - I'm gonna say blue. - All right. - Is this too much hair gel? - No, no you look good. (Spanish pop music) - So I look okay? - Yeah, you look fine. Put the gel away. - Remember, we're not gonna talk. - What? - We're not gonna hang out or anything.

You know, salsa, whatever. - No. - No, no. - A blood vessel burst in his liver. I'm sorry. I didn't really want it to come out this way. I'm really sorry. (sobbing) - [Dion] I didn't want to say anything, but our dad died. I'm sorry. (Bruni crying) (crickets chirping) (sentimental instrumental music) (laughing) (soft orchestral music) - [Ed] Hi. - Ed! Come here. - How are you, Tia? - But I'm happy to see you. - He was working in this office in Chicago doing some, I don't know, weird programming thing that he does, and he said he had this coworker who was this Indian man, this guy from India. - Yeah. - And the guy would say, Gabriel, the way you talk about women, is how I feel about food. (laughing) - That's funny, I remember that because because he would say, oh yeah Dion, women are like curry. You should try every flavor. (laughing) - Oh my God. You try to stay completely serious, and we try to make you laugh. That will be a game, okay. Let's start. Okay but you have to look at it. (humming) (laughing) Now, he's the next one. - Okay. - He's got to be serious. I mean your father was never serious, you have to be serious. You start. - Hey booboo. - Come on Cali boo. (laughing) - Merci boucou. (laughing) Now you try to make me laugh. - Oh you're so serious, look at you. So respective. (in foreign language) Oh here I am just for funsies. You look like a turtle on vacation. (laughing) - Do you ever look at your penis, and be like, weird. My penis is aging. - What do you mean? - I looked down at my penis just now, and I could tell that it was aging. Like I just felt like my penis is aging. You know what I mean? - Yeah. - [Ed] So, do you think this place is our inheritance? - God, I hope so. - I cannot describe it to you where it is, because it's part of the soul. Part of your soul, part of your soul. Part of mine. - So you've never been there? - No, I've never been there, but my goal is to go there. And I stay there, I don't want to come back. I want to stay there. I want to stay there with the two of you. (laughing) Father Gabriel, he's in Medellin. It's a great place. - Yeah. - The boomer (muffled speaking), please watch out. Colombian boomers are very very very cute. They're really attractive. And they attract your soul. Come on, come. (laughing) - Is this your house? - No. - Is this our father's house? - No. Al Camilla belongs to the whole family. The whole family. (birds cawing) (wind blowing) When I was little, and Gabriel was little, we saw my father hitting my mother. And, Gabriel he started to laugh. It was very painful for us, because, in a way, he was a father, and he say he loved us. It really affected Gabriel. He couldn't give enough love to his children, and he couldn't be completely responsible, because he was keeping a lot of anger inside of him. So, you need to forgive your father, you need to forget. We came with a mission to this life. Our mission is to give love, to forgive, not to try to find perfection. There is nobody perfect, but we need to love. - He wasn't perfect, but I loved my dad. - [Tia] Thank you for telling me that. Thank you for telling me that.

Okay, I don't care. - Okay. - Okay. - What are you talking about? - When you speak Spanish, it's like you're always apologizing for yourself. - Well, my Spanish isn't-- - Dude, you speak Spanish. - It's not my fault my three-year-old self stopped speaking Spanish after moving away from my dad. - No, it's not your fault. But you can recognize how fuckin' out of bounds it was, for your mother to take you and put you in that situation where you-- - No warning, no goodbye, no nothin'. You don't think that hurt dad? You don't think he talked about that shit like every day when I loved with him? Huh? I mean, I know you love your mom, I know you do. But that's never gonna be okay. - Okay, well I apologize for her. - We got Bill's, do you call Bill dad? - No. - It's okay if you do, I'm not judging. - No. - It's okay if you do. - I don't. - More of a father figure than dad ever was, really. - Are you mad at me? - No, I'm not mad, I just want you to speak Spanish and wake the fuck up, you know?
