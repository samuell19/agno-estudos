[Tempe bumper music] [Dramatic music] [Crime scene noise] Uh, excuse me? [Camera flash pops] Um, sorry officer... uh, can you tell me what happened in there? Oh, man, y'know... I ain't at liberty to say... 'cause this is a police investigation. Oh, come on... just a hint? Well, without gettin' too graphic... Some psycho busted into yonder house... and chopped up the whole Millhouse family like they was a stack of cordwood. Uh... cordwood? Cordwood... you know, like it was covered with blood and brains, and chunks of intestine... Oh. Thank you. When are we gonna get to see some bodies? Jesus Christ, what a bunch of losers... I don't know... It's a lot smaller turnout than the last one. Hiya, Detective Orville... This is Sergeant Slade from Metro. From here on in, he'll be taking over the case. Sergeant Slade! Oh man... everybody's heard about you... - Yeah? - So how you making out on the front lines here? I mean... you having any problems? Aw, heck, no, you know... out here people, they still have respect for a badge. What about forensics? What time do you expect them? I called dispatch and they said about an hour... so looks like we're looking at about 40 minutes. Well, you just point their asses in the general direction of that house. We'll be inside. 10-4, Chief. I'll stay here and handle crowd control. You fellas want I should get a couple of ambulances to help with the victims? No rush, no rush. So, what's the deal, Orville? Millhouse family... father, mother, teen aged daughter. About 9:45, someone calls the local pizza parlor. About 10:15, the pizza kid arrives... the door's wide open. Kid comes in, see's what's left of 'em... Loses everything that's in his stomach... and dials 911. You were the first to arrive on the scene? Naw, Barney Fife over there arrived about 30 minutes before me. - Oh, great. - No, he didn't touch anything. And what makes you so sure this is Butch Harlow's handiwork? People around here think that "gang-bang" is wife-swapping on a Friday night. Hasn't been a murder out here since my dad was on the force years ago. Yeah, it's one thing saying this is murder in the sticks and another saying Butch Harlow did it, got it? He's Public Fruitcase Number One. You so much as think he did this. the Feds"ll be up faster than you can say Dick Tracy. Take a look... we"ll take it from there. Christ, turn on a light! This place gives me the creeps. Clowns, huh? His last four set of victims were dressed as clowns. Read somewhere the Feds think he's going through some kind of Gacy period. And the rest of Harlow's M.O.? Well... there's the knives. He's big on knives. There's blood all over the place, the kitchen, the bath... This guy really likes to drag things out. Anything else? Yeah, the kicker for me... was that Harlow always leaves a message behind. So after I saw this... All I had to do was start snoopin' around... To come up with this. - Shit. - Yeah. [Main title music] You ready to go, baby? Let's do it. [Doorbell rings] Hello... are you Mister... Walt Lipsky? - That's me. - Hi, I'm Serena Stalin regional salesperson for Avalon Cosmetics I think we set up an appointment today with your wife... Ooh, uh... as much as I'd love to finally settle down, I'm afraid I'm not married. I think there's been some kind of mistake. Oh... [Sighs] I can't believe this. You see, this is my first day on the job. I get up this morning, my car breaks down. Then, on the way over here, I almost get pulled over for speeding, and now this. I really have to apologize... The home office tells me their computer never makes a mistake. Bunch of liars. I should have stuck to modeling! - Yes, you should have. - I don't know whether to take that as a compliment or not... Oh, it's definitely a compliment. Oh, well thank you, Mister Lipsky. What a nice thing to say. - Call me Walt. - Walt. I sure wish there was some way I could help you out. Well, we do sell a wide variety of men's cosmetics... - Oh, do you now? - We certainly do. Well, um... You got any Belasco cologne? 'Cause I'm a Belasco cologne wearing kind of guy, you know. Well, you'll have to let me check my magic makeup box... I'll tell you what... why don't you come on in and we'll see what we can see. And um... if you got some Belasco, you got yourself your first sale. Okay. I really appreciate this, Walt. I just did not want to come out of my first day looking like an idiot, you know? Hey, don't worry about it. Um... By the way, can I get you some coffee or something? I mean... I make some tasty coffee. Oh, no thanks. Remember... I'm driving! Serena Stalin. That's an interesting name. - I like it. - So do I. Hmm. Now would you look at that. No Belasco cologne in there at all. [Tense music] Trick lock. Installed it myself. Magnetic, just like the ones they use in psycho wards. It's a lot of fun when my dates go bad. Oh, if you're thinking about breaking any of these windows... Don't bother. They're Plexiglas and they don't break. I'm what your average psychiatrist would call "anal-retentive." I... I have mace. Well if I were you, I'd be gettin' it on out, then... before I reach you and do something you probably won't be digging a whole lot. I know who you are. Who you really are. Enlighten me. For one thing, your name isn't Walt Lipsky. It's Butch Harlow. And you've killed 14 people in the last 2 years. In fact, at one point, you even had plastic surgery to alter your identity... but the FBI was never able to track you down. And what makes you think I'm this Butch Harlow guy, Nancy Drew? Did you find the bodies I buried in my basement? You used to bury the bodies in a graveyard near your house usually in freshly dug graves and right over the people supposed to be buried there. - You've done your homework. - Yes, I have. Well, you hit the fucking jackpot. Ta-da! I'm Butch, you found me! Now I guess the $25,000 question is... you think I'm this horrible serial killer... so why the hell would a smart gal like yourself come to the serial killer's lair by herself... and expose my secret identity. Now to me... that doesn't sound very constructive. You won't kill me. I hope you're not placing cash bets on that, sweetness. - The neighbors saw me pull in. - Kids are in school, parents are at work. I know these neighbors' schedules better than they do. Trust me, nobody saw you come in here. I have a letter. And I left it with a reliable friend. - I'll bet. - I do. And it tells everything I know, which is a lot. I don't keep in touch with her every day from now until the end of time, it gets sent to the law enforcement agency of her choice. Fuck! This is just fucking great! Are you happy about this? You know, I kill people for a living, I'm pretty goddamn unstable to begin with! You really think I need my head fucked with some more? 'Cause I sure don't. So what are you gonna do? Play Wonder Woman & turn me over to the Feds? - No. - Then what the fuck do you want, money? In case the gold-plated mailbox out front didn't tip you off - I don't got any. - I don't want your money. The whole reason I tracked you down was because, two years ago, I watched you rape and kill my best friend. You didn't know I was there, or you would have killed me, too. It took her two hours to die. You stabbed her fourteen times in the chest. All I can say is, sorry. So what do you want, revenge? Go for it, babe. I want... I want to learn how to kill. Excuse me? Maybe I'm a little fucked up here, maybe I... didn't hear you just right. What did you just say? I want to be a serial killer, just like you. This is a fucking joke, right? No joke. Well, you know what you do... You take a really sharp knife, and you find some poor bastard that you wanna like... kill and stuff... and you sort of fucking stab them with it! End of fucking list. Did you get that all down, or should I recap? - I'm being serious. - Yeah, you're being serious. So why the hell would you come to the guy who whacked your best friend and ask him how to kill somebody? I mean, I thought I had fucking problems... Because, not-so coincidentally, I had my first orgasm that same night. Well... I am pretty good at making a first impression... And... because you've never been caught. No matter how close the police got to you... they never found you. Yeah, well... you found me. I'm a lot smarter than the police. Maybe. But one of the main reasons I never got caught was because I didn't have to drag around some Lizzie Borden wannabe and show her ropes. I don't need a partner, okay? I'm strictly a solo act, if you can dig that. Let me get down to business. I want you to show me how to kill people. How you kill people. You do that for me, and I burn the little letter my friend has. You don't do that, and, well... I'll be sure to send you some tampons when they put you in general population. They say the first time you're anally raped, you... bleed a lot, and... I am sure a pretty little boy like you's gonna need them. You know, um... I liked you a lot more when you were talking about your first orgasm. First things first. Teach me. [Ominous music] I don't smoke. Never did. I don't trust anybody who doesn't smoke. Well, that's really not my problem. And I'm damn sure I don't trust you. Wise man. So talk. Tell me what you know. You're going to have to be a little more specific, I mean... It's been a while since I've had to teach a class. Okay... why do you kill people? You don't know? I thought you were the one talking about your first orgasm earlier. Remember, the part of the conversation I actually liked? I meant, why do you kill people, smart-ass. Why do I do it? Think about it. You kill somebody, you cross this line, y'know? I mean, it is the line, you know. The ultimate thing you could do. I mean, hell, the only thing you could do to surpass that would be... kill yourself... and that's not very constructive now, is it? It's like when you kill somebody, it makes you that much more powerful 'cause you took that fucking life. You made the grand-daddy motherfucker of all decisions. What... you think you're evil? Sure. [Chuckles] But... it's like the Bible, Stephen King, and any given episode of "The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" shows us, evil people have incredible sex. We'll see... won't we? First off, never... never kill anyone you know, or anybody in your own neighborhood. That's always dipshit mistake number one. And don't write about it. Might as well write "My Confession For The Police" at the top of the page... even if you destroy it afterwards, some asshole always ends up finding it half-burned in the goddamn fireplace after they raid your house... guns are a bitch. They're loud, they're big to carry around, hard to keep from getting traced easy to ID through ballistics, and motherfucking impossible to get rid of. If you wanna kill lots of people with a gun, you might as well save that last bullet for yourself. 'cause you're gonna need it when you get caught. Well, what if I used gloves and shot somebody? Honey, with the way forensic science is these days, you could accidentally let out a fart when you killed somebody and the cops would know about it. Trust me... don't use a gun unless you wanna get caught. So I stab somebody, then. No, you don't just "stab somebody"... not if you're trying to kill 'em. First of all... have you ever stabbed another person before? No... Well, it's not like stabbing a pillow. The human body has about eight jillion fucking bones in it and if you don't know what you're doing, you're just gonna end up bouncing off a rib cage or something. I mean, hell... makes a hell of a mess... but it doesn't quite get the job done, if you know what I mean. I used to make that mistake a lot when I got started. Well what did you do, I mean... were they still alive after you stabbed them? If they were still screaming and believe me, most of them were still screaming... I'd bash their head in with a rock or something. I mean... you gotta cut down on the noise factor real quick. You ever think you let someone live and not know it? Maybe. But I got enough fucking problems, you know what I mean? [Dramatic music continues] [Lighter flares] How do you choose your victims? I mean... you obviously don't have something against just women, or African-Americans, or homosexuals. You kill everybody. Why? What do you think this is about, politics? Well, I keep hearing all these things about how serial killers are looking for revenge... usually against a parent or a relative or something. I think I read that in Cosmo once. Are you looking for revenge? No. It's just something I do, you know. Get my kicks on Route Sixty-Six. Are you scared? Scared? Why would I be scared? 'Cause you're looking for the deeper meaning. Whenever anyone goes out looking for the deeper meaning, it means they're trying to justify something that, you just can't justify. Like killing somebody. Every pissant shrink with a diploma and a fucking lobotomy drill has his own little theory about why some guy wakes up one morning, and... decides to whack his wife and two-point-five kids into prime fucking cutlets. He was beaten by his dad when he was a kid. He was raped by his dad when he was a kid. He was raped by the goddamn Good Humor man when he was a kid. Blah-fucking-blah. They say it's genetic, they say it's a chemical imbalance. You... you wanna know what it really is? Fucking primal instinct. It's more than that. You wanna know my opinion? And what's that? Stop reading... fucking "Cosmo". You still wanna come with me? That's why I'm here. Well then I gotta tell you more thing... and it is the most important. And what's that? Don't stop in the middle. You pull a blade on somebody you don't even fucking know and make like you're gonna off them don't you dare fucking chicken out. Chicken out? I mean, think about it... why would I be here if I was going to chicken out? Oh yeah... on paper, you're ready to go get nuts on somebody. But when it's go time, it's a whole different story. Look, all I'm saying is, you've got the knife out, the piece of meat has seen your face. You kill... Or I'll kill. You wanted to know why I never got caught... it's because I don't leave shit laying around. And if you put my ass in a sling... I'll drop you like a rabid fucking weasel. Did you forget my little letter? You fuck up on me... and I will forget your little letter. That's just a natural fact. I'm ready to go. Actually, I'm thinking about, uh... calling up this chick a friend of mine keeps trying to set me up with. - You have friends? - Fuck off. Anyhow, her name's Bobbie Jo something. Some hillbilly name or some shit. She doesn't have any friends or relatives or anything. I checked. I guess she spends all her free time getting tanked in singles' bars, trying to pick up guys. She's a real lush. So you call her up and invite her over for a nightcap? Something like that. I thought you said not to kill anybody you know? Hey... I never said I knew the bitch! Girlfriend, I am ready for some action! [Knocks on door] "Let's give 'em something to talk about, a little mystery to figure out..." [Laughing] Whatever you do, wake up all my neighbors, okay? Sorry! Are you Walt... Lipshitz? [Laughs] That's, uh... Lipsky... Walt Lipsky. And I'm... guessing you must be Bobbie Jo, right? Right you are, baby-doll! Are you ready for our date? Actually, I was wondering how you'd feel about a... little company? Company? Hi. I'm company. I just figured we'd throw her in... you know, for good measure. Oh! A threesome! Far fucking out! No, seriously... I saw this on "Springer" the other day! Too loud. Are you guys for real? You... you really wanna do this? Hey, if it feels good, I say do it. What about you? You really want to do this? Of course I do. [Sinister music] Oh, we're going down in the basement? Yeah, it's my entertainment room. Hey, I got a Ping-Pong table down there! You love Ping-Pong! Ping-Pong, huh... Whoops, you okay there? You gotta watch that gravity thing, it's a bitch. What the hell kind of movies are these? "Traces Of Death"? "Guinea Pig"? "Cocksucking Toddlers"? Research. Don't you guys have like... I don't know, "Untamed Heart"? Okay, this shit's getting a little obnoxious. Good. [Heavy metal music] You wanna not grab Peggy Sue here until I get a hold of her? - It's Bobbie Jo! - I don't give a country fuck what her name is! Hold your goddamn horses or you're gonna screw this whole thing up! - Stay the hell away from me!!! - Come here. - No!!! - Oh, for Chrissake! Well, you gonna do something or not? This ain't the goddamn rodeo, y'know! [Stabs in stomach] What did you just do? I'm trying to kill her, so I stabbed her in the stomach! Yeah, you stabbed her in the stomach! What the fuck do you think this is... a "Friday the 13th" movie? You don't stab somebody in the fucking stomach! Well I didn't want to hit her in the ribs or something like that! What, did you think you were gonna kill her by cutting off her food supply? Fuck you! This was my first time killing somebody, okay? - Pick up the knife! - Go to hell! Would you just pick up the goddamn knife? My arms are starting to get just a little tired here... - Give it here. Look... you don't wanna stab somebody in the stomach because it takes them too damn long to die! You don't want to do that artsy torture shit until you've killed a couple of people and you're a little more comfortable! Now watch... You wanna go... right up against the ribcage... up to the heart! Put your hand on the knife! [Stabs deeper] Oh, shit. I think we missed the heart. We must've just popped a lung or something. You gotta be real careful with the angle or you'll fuck it up big time. Fuck... Would... you... shut... fucking... UP... already?!? Christ! Congratulations... you just entered the wonderful world of homicide. How do you feel? It's more blood than I thought. Yeah. Do you want to know how much I like blood? How much? [Seductive music] Lay back. Now, come on, we both know where this is going... why don't you just, uh... pop out them melons, huh? Hmmm, not yet... another time... [Music continues] You scared yet? I don't get scared. You should be... I could have cut your fucking head off if I wanted to. You're a bitch. I mean... you're a worse head case than I ever was. Oh, yeah, baby. You got it. You wanna kill me right now, don't you? I wanna kill everybody. I'm wacky, I'm nuts. Well, I guess you could... I just helped you kill somebody, right? I mean, I don't have anything to hold over your head anymore. You could drop me without batting an eyelash. I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic. Aw... [Rock music plays] What's with the chainsaw? Well, after work, you get to learn how to clean up your fucking mess after you've repainted your room with somebody's fucking vital fluids. Needless to say, you will be doing your share of the cleaning. You really made a fucking mess last night. I mean, sure, thanks for the sex and all, but... I could've banged a finger- painting gorilla in here and made less of a fucking mess... I still don't understand about the chainsaw. [Starts chainsaw] Well, it does make it easier to mail off the pieces, now doesn't it? God, how much of this bitch is left? She's really starting to get heavy. Well... the upper torso... Thinking we're gonna send that care of General Delivery in Intercourse, Pennsylvania. Intercourse, Pennsylvania? Yeah, it's a real place. I saw it on a T-shirt once. I think you've got... the head and most of the pelvis... And nobody's going to figure this out? Well... not until she starts to stink, anyway. Hey, um... you got any more stamps left? [Dramatic music] Hey, you alright? You know, uh... now that I bought you a cheeseburger, I own your soul. I'll tell you what, um... Why don't I come on over and get down on all fours and you can take a shit on me, too. Look, my mind's on something else, okay? Would you stop taking it so damn personally? Look, honeybunch, you hold my ass for ransom and tell me, "Butch, I wanna kill people". So we kill somebody. I mean, what the hell, I'm easy. You got your wish. So what the fuck do you want from me now? Do you wanna rob a bank or something? I'm fine. I got what I wanted. Yeah, you got what you wanted. That's just great. I'm very happy for you. You are taking this personally. You know, that's a load of shit, alright? It's like you said... you got what you wanted, so why don't we just... say our good-byes and be done with it. Oh, so that's it? We kill somebody and just go our separate ways? Let's go on with our lives like we met at a party. Party's over, fuck you very much? What the fuck else do you want? A serial killer diploma? This is it, Serena. You kill somebody, you spend a shitload of time mopping up the blood, you sweat out getting picked up by the cops for about 10 years, and if you are lucky... you move on. It doesn't get any better than this. This isn't about killing people anymore, Butch. This is about us. Oh, Jesus Christ... I got a newsflash for you kiddo, there ain't no "us". You pulled that "letter with a friend" bullshit on me and I did what I had to do. Bullshit. If that were true, you would've killed me last night instead of sleeping with me and spent all day mailing off two bodies. I don't have that kind of stamp money. Look, two years ago, something passed from you to me I've been trying to find out what the hell it is ever since. You can call it karma... you can call it whatever you want, I don't care. So look, here's the deal. If you want to behave like every other stupid asshole who's walked into my life and tells me whatever he thinks I want to hear just so he can get down my pants? Well that's fine... I'll turn around and walk out of here right now. I've got no problem with that. Whoa, whoa, wait a second... what are we talking about here? Look, let's just drop this, okay? I'm... No, no no no... let's discuss this. - You got a thing for me, don't you? - What?!? You like me, you think that it's over, and now, you're upset about it. Hey, that's perfectly understandable. Don't worry about it. You ego maniacal prick! We roll around on a bloody bed... - Yeah. - Chop up some dead bar hag with a chainsaw... - Oh yeah. - And you think somehow you hit my fucking love button? - That's right. - I mean, I've got my hang-ups... but I still go for the candy, the flowers, and the Hallmark cards, you know? And I suppose what happened between us last night didn't mean a goddamn thing, right? Besides the fact that I was a little horny? Oh, come the fuck off it! You got as much out of it as I did! Well, it was all right, but let's not get carried away here... Um... what about the, uh, thing I did with my tongue? - I've had better. - What? Oh, Jesus Christ... is that all you care about? How you rate in the sack? Well... well no, I mean... I care about all that other stuff, too, it's just... it's just right now, you're telling me I was just "all right". What the hell does that mean, "just all right"? I mean, did you feel I had room for improvement or what? You're as bad as Rupert! Who's Rupert? Uh... lemme... let me rephrase that. Who the fuck is Rupert?! He's my boyfriend. Your, uh... your "boyfriend" as in the guy who took you to the senior prom when you were sixteen, or your boyfriend as in, it's time you and I had a serious fucking talk? I was going to tell you about him... Jesus Christ, don't start doing me any fucking favors! It's not like you think. How could it not be like I think? Are you two living together? Yeah. Separate beds? No... Do you love him? Look... no more bullshit. I just need to know. Do you love this guy? I hate him, okay?! I met him six months ago and he seemed like the right kind of guy. So I said to myself, "What the hell, girl?" What the hell. He wants me to move in with him, so I did. It was the easiest thing to do... so fucking easy! The minute I was in, that was it. The talking, the nice clothes... the "What do you think, honey?" It all just... And now, I just fucking hate him. Does he beat you? Please! [Laughs] You feel a little better now? Aw, Christ... Well... you know what I think we should do? If this involves your tongue, I think I'm gonna take a raincheck. No. What I think we should do is, we should... go over to this guy Rupert's house and pick your stuff. - You can move in with me. - No, just forget it. I don't want to ever see that asshole again. Hey... I said "us". I'll be there. This guy gets into bar fights for a living, Butch! What are you gonna do? Go over there and try and go ten rounds with him? Who said anything about fighting? Well, well, well. Look who's back in town. My girl. Just let me in, Rupert. You didn't say the magic word. Why don't you take it easy. She just wants to get her stuff, okay. Who the fuck are you supposed to be, Eightball? Nobody special. May I? Why the hell not. How about a hug, sexy? Are you sober? [Sighs] This ain't off to a good start. Look... I don't want to fight. You don't wanna fight. Is that why you brought Slim here with you, huh? You're gone for two fucking days, sweetheart. There's nobody here to cook, nobody's doing the dishes, nobody's cleaning the fucking house... This place is starting to look like shit! - So hire a maid. - Excuse me... cunt?!? - Stay out of this, Woody. - Why don't you show the lady some respect? Like I said, stay out of this. Or I'll cream the fucking wall with your face. Look... I've got some clothes in the back room. Why don't you get those for me... while I finish talking to Rupert? What is this shit? - I'm moving out. - The hell you are! Look, this has been coming for a long time now. You know it, and I know it. We can either do this like adults, or you can make it bad for the both of us. Goddamn, honey-pie... you got yourself a brand- new dick stickin' in you and all of a sudden, you're the bitch of the ball! Excuse the fuck outta me!!! I ain't cuttin' it anymore for you?! Let's not forget who's the one who took you in, princess!!! You "took me in" so I could be your goddamn nursemaid! No! I took you in so you and me could have a life together! This is our life together, Rupert! This shithole! Me coming home from work and watching you drink up your unemployment check! Me spending twenty- four hours a day watching you rot like a fucking corpse. I mean, look at you! You don't even know why you want me anymore! You drank up whatever sex drive you had left! So why am I here? A trophy? Someone to bitch about poor little Rupert's life to? Okay, sugar... you get one last chance. You get the hell off your high horse and you get in the kitchen like you're gonna make me some dinner. I'll forget about Woody. I might even just bust his friggin' nose, let him off with that. - No. - Well hat's too bad, you psychotic whore, because you see, the alternative is, you're gonna have to get used to sleeping on your stomach for a while. - A real long while. - Just take your best shot, honey-pie. Did you tell your new fag boyfriend what a fucking fruit loop you are? How fucked-up your brain is because of what happened to you and your mom... - Shut up, Rupert!!! - Must've slipped your mind, huh? Well, I tell you what... after I whip the living shit out of you and Woody over there, we'll all just sit around and have a little chat about it. - I only told him one thing. - What's that? Where your daddy's old shotgun is. [Shotgun cocks] Hi. Howya doin'? You ain't gonna do shit with that. Wait... what about that "guns are a bitch" speech you gave me? Not a problem, seeing as how this one's registered in good old Rupert's name. Uh... look, I ain't in the mood for no fucking games here... Why don't you, uh... go ahead and pull up a seat there, Rupert. Please. [Tense music] You guys really didn't think I was gonna hit anybody... did ya? Rule number one: Shut the fuck up or I will kill you. You got a chance to talk, you went on and on about some stupid shit, so now your right to speak is being taken away from you. If you understand rule number one please nod yes. Great. By the way, you probably don't wanna go overboard on that nodding shit Rupe, old buddy, because... I got a pretty tight squeeze on this trigger, and uh... you might end up giving yourself a twelve-gauge root canal, you know what I mean? Okay... here's what we're going to do there, Coolio. We are gonna play This Little Piggy. Are you familiar with that game? Nod yes if you know. You've never heard of This Little Piggy? No shit. I thought everybody knew This Little Piggy. Oh, c'mon, Rupert, you know this one! "This little piggy went to the market..." "And this little piggy stayed home..." Right, right, and then there's a little piggy that eats beef, and... and piggy that does the "wee-wee-wee" shit. Sometimes you play it with toes, but tonight... tonight we're playing with fingers. And because you're gonna be the one that's gonna be playing the game... I'm gonna go ahead and take this shotgun here... outta your face. Now, I did change some of the rules to the game. From this point on... You are gonna do exactly what I say... no more, no less. You decide to do anything else, well then... Hats are gonna become very, very unimportant to you, very fucking quick. - Understood? - Can we talk... Woah, Woah, Woah... now wait a second here. Maybe my memory's a bit fuzzy, but... I don't seem to remember giving you permission to talk. Pull that shit again and your question's gonna be... "Can I please get a sponge to wipe my brains off the wall?" Got it? Found it! Okay, Rupert... see, here's the deal. I'm gonna wiggle each of your fingers, one at a time. Each time I wiggle a finger... you tell me what that particular little piggy does. Get it right and we move on to the next little piggy. Get it wrong and... we operate. And you move your arm... I pull this trigger, and it's Game Over, Player One. Okay then... let's do it! - Serena? - "This little piggy..." Come on, Rupert, what's that little piggy do? It ain't a trick question. This little piggy, uh... goes to the, um, market...? Very good, Rupert! Yeah, I think he's gettin' the hang of this! - "And this little piggy..." - You aren't mad, are you, honey? Oh, man, Rupert! You had a rhythm going there and you lost it! Now, don't move... [Screams] Jesus, my finger!!! Be a man, Rupert! You're coming real fucking close to breaking the rules of our little game! - "This little piggy..." - I can't... it hurts... it hurts... Oh man, Rupert, you are really battin' a thousand here, buddy! Hold still, you stupid asshole! No! [Chops off finger] [Rupert screams] Jesus Christ honey, don't you think you... went a little overboard there? Well, he wouldn't stop moving! Well what the hell are we gonna do now? We ran out of piggies! Then we're just gonna have to find something else to chop off... [Shotgun blast] [Romantic music] [Oven door closes] Wow, he cooks, too... I'm impressed. [Chuckles] I just dumped a box of Rice-A-Roni in... a pot here, and uh... tossed it in the oven. Tricks 'em every time. I just figured I should... do something special for you... you know, celebrate. Celebrate what? Common interests. Here's to common interests. [Glasses clink] Skoal. What? Oh, nothing. It's just that... It's just that you look really great tonight, that's all. Well, thank you! You know you didn't have to say that. I wanted to. For that matter, you didn't have to take me in, either. I mean, I don't think us living together was covered in our so-called deal. I just liked the idea of having sex every night, that's all. You know, us living together is not always gonna be wine and roses. I mean, just look at Rupert and I, for example. You and Rupert had fucking problems, okay? I mean, yeah, I'm a serial killer, granted, but... even I wasn't that big a piece of shit. If I ever start acting like him, you have full permission to blow my head off, too. Well, for instance... who gets control of the TV if we both wanna watch something different? I dunno, who cleans the toilet? - Who does the cooking? - What about a joint banking account? What about... when it's that time of month and I just want to be left alone for a few days. Ooh, um... you're not one of those chicks that goes all nutzoid when she gets her period, are you? What do you think? Shit. No seriously, Butch, these are questions we never asked ourselves before I moved in here. We just... sorta did it. Can't we just... take it one day at a time and see what happens. I mean... You have to admit... this isn't exactly your standard Harlequin romance we got going here. [Chuckles] Amen. You do look great, though. You know, if I didn't know better... I'd say you had a thing for me. Fuck you. Fuck you, too. Hmm... By the way... I was just thinking about something. - Uh-oh. - No no no no, hear me out. I'm thinking, shit, this is our first night of living together we should do something special. We are doing something special. I'm sampling some of your fine cuisine. Actually, I was... leaning a little more towards us maybe... going out and getting ourselves in a little trouble. Where do you want to go, it's your pick. Any ideas? Um... maybe. Well? Oh... no, you're just gonna laugh. It's your night. I promise I am not gonna laugh. No, it's really silly, you're gonna laugh. Jesus Christ, the suspense is killing me! Come on! Okay... well, when I was a little girl, I went to Catholic school. And you were molested by a priest. No, actually... I was gonna say I had a thing for priests. Uh-huh... Nuns, too. So what you're getting at is... instead of us going out and picking up your average everyday, run-of-the-mill murder victim, you think we should go and bump off a priest? Not exactly... The answer's "Mount Kilaminjaro". It's "Mount Everest", dear. [Baby crying] Aren't you gonna do something about the baby or what, June? He's teething, Ward. Well, I changed him last time. Well, I had him... [Baby cooing] Hey, while you're up, do you think you could get me a beer? [Knocks on door] A little late for visitors, don't ya think? Probably those damn Jehovah's Witnesses. I told 'em to come back at another time. I'll go get it... dear. [Knocks on door] Who is it? Look, I'm sorry to bother you, I need to use your phone. Well... there's a pay phone right down the street... Just tell 'em you don't want a goddamn subscription to The Watchtower! My girlfriend and I were just in a bad car accident... she's... she's bleeding and she's unconscious... Uh, well... did you try that CPR on her? Look, please just let me in and use the phone. I think my girlfriend's dying... Ward... there's a man out there who says he was in an accident and his girlfriend's dying... he wants to use our phone. Eh... ah, what the hell. Just don't let him get any blood or anything on the furniture. Oh, my God! It's a priest! Hey, uh... you ain't no Jehovah's Witnesses... You broke my nose, bitch! What'd you call me? [Repeated skull cracking] Uh... Serena! [More skull cracking] Serena! What?!? You may wanna... lighten up on that phone shit for a little while, um... I'd say Mr. Personality's just about fucking dead. [Chuckles] [Grunts] [Baby cries] [Shotgun blast, baby explodes] What the fuck was that?!? I'm sorry... Sometimes I get a little edgy? That was a goddamn baby, Butch!!! I never done that before... I never... never killed a baby... Seriously? Yeah. First one. Wow. [Loud techno music plays] What the fuck are you doing? I said, "What the fuck are you doing?!?" [Turns off music] [Sighs] I'm entertaining myself. Yeah well... you happen to be destroying my little moment of happy silence here. You have had "happy silence" for three days now. It's time to snap the fuck out of it. Well I guess the honeymoon is over... You know, for a serial killer, you sure are a drag sometimes. I just think we need to pace ourselves, that's all. I mean, if we go out every single night and kill some guy, we're gonna get caught. We're not gonna get caught. We've got a good thing going here. - This is getting dangerous. - What's getting dangerous? You like this way too damn much. Uh, well that is why I'm here! Listen... When I kill somebody, I treat it like jerking off. - Oh, brother... - No, just hear me out, okay? I treat it that way because it's something I like to do... it's something I need to do every so often to... release whatever it is I need to release. But I know when not to do it. But you... you just like it. You don't care about anything else. Not the facts, not the cops, not the right kind of victims, just the blood. And that's just about the point when you're gonna fuck up and get us both busted. I think you're underestimating me. Yeah... okay. Actually... you know want to know what I think it is? I think you're afraid. Why, because you're a woman? No... because I'm getting better at this than you are. You're getting tired. You've killed a bunch of people, and it just doesn't matter that much to you anymore. And I come along, and it's everything to me. You gonna turn this into a pissing contest now? You're getting burned out... am I right? I am not getting burned out. I just don't feel it necessary to go out every single fucking night and kill somebody, okay? [Chuckles] I mean Christ, what kind of a fucking nutjob are you, anyway? What did you call me?!? Oh, for Chrissake! You just called me a nutjob, right? I hate to break it to you kiddo, but uh... neither one of us are exactly playing with a full deck here. No, asshole... you just called me a nutjob! That's what Rupert used to call me! I was waiting for this. You wanna let go of my arm, Butch? - Is this gonna get ugly? - Let... go. If you're thinking of hitting me I'd get that thought right out of your pretty little red head. If you know anything at all about me baby you know my days of backing down from people are over. So let me go. Why don't you just... calm down. No! Look at you! Lying around, talking a bunch of shit! And that's all it is too, is shit! Your little videos, and your newspaper clippings! It's just a big crock of shit! You wanna know what you are? You're a fucking poseur! - A what? - That's right, a poseur! You think if you got a knife and some snuff films and you start talking like you just fell out of a Quentin Tarantino movie that somehow you'll just magically become the next Ted Bundy! Well, I got some bad news for you, sunshine! I think you got a ways to go yet. You know, all the sudden I'm starting to identify with good ol' Rupert. Wrong thing to say. Look, um... Why don't you come to bed? You must be joking. Where the hell do you think you're going? Some place where the fun never ends. Don't wait up. Well... fuck her! Bitch can go out... I'm gonna go rent a movie... Poseur. Shit. [Hillbilly music plays] So. So... You look like, uh... someone who's got a lot on their mind. Yeah, something like that. Let me guess. It's the old man, right? A little. See, I knew it! - You just had that look. - And what kind of look is that? The kind where I've got "sucker" written on my forehead in big shiny letters? No, you just don't seem like the type of girl who'd be sitting here drinking herself silly for absolutely no reason. What can I say. It happens. Well... you could bend a sympathetic ear. Look, you seem like a really nice guy... but I gotta warn you right now if you're looking to find yourself a one-night soulmate, you're definitely barking up the wrong tree. Whoa! Hey look, I don't know what happened to you tonight, but all I know is I'm just a guy out drinking a beer, and... I look over and I see you, and I say to myself... "Self, what the hell." "Why don't we just go over there and see what's bothering her." But obviously, I made a mistake. I'm sorry... Look, I'm sorry. It's just a reflex action. - Okay. We should start over. - We should. - Hi, I'm Chris. - Hi, Serena. Good, now see... that was much better. So uh... what is bothering you? Oh... let's not talk about that, okay? You know, they say sometimes it's uh... it's pretty good to tell your problems to a complete stranger you meet in a bar. [Chuckles] Oh, really. Is that what they say? You know, I always thought "they" say "don't talk to strangers." Well, maybe "they're" full of shit and we shouldn't listen to "them" anymore. That's always been my policy. So uh... why don't you let me buy you another drink and you can tell me what's bothering you on this fine evening. What do you got there, Seagram's Seven, or... or Zima? Jack Daniel's, straight, no chaser. Shit! Oh, I should have known... you're Irish, right? Yep! That's how I got the red hair and the enlarged liver. Uh-oh. Yeah, I've heard stories about Irish people. - Such as? - Well, you know... Irish people are supposedly full of shit, right? Oh no, no, no. You're mixing that up with people with brown eyes. - People with brown eyes are full of shit. - Ah... Well, what about us people with blue eyes? Blue eyes... eh, they're half a quart low. Fuck her! Sorry about that... You guys are closing already? I thought this place was supposed to be open 'til midnight? Yeah, well... I decided to close early tonight. You see, I got this Peter Murphy tape today... and I need an unbiased opinion on whether or not I got ripped off. An... unbiased opinion? Yeah, like, I'll put it in, you'll listen to it, tell me if you dig on it. And, you know, I mean, it'll only take a second. Okay. Who's Peter Murphy? A-ha-ha! Cool... Virgin ears! Howdy. Hold on... almost got it... [Alternative music plays] This is uh... Peter Murphy? No... That was just a line I used to get you to stick around. Ah. Great. I'm Patti. I'm a lesbian. You don't say. I'm Butch. I'm straight. With a name like Butch. I'm Lori... Not Patti's girlfriend... I dunno why everyone thinks that. I mean, I date guys and stuff. They call me Boog. Boog, huh. Hey, well that's cool. I really appreciate you... thinking of me for this little get-together you're planning, but... - if you'll excuse me... - No, wait a minute... Alright, I am very selective on who I close my store down early for. And I saw you walking around here, man... and when I saw you and I thought, y'know... there's someone I can really talk to. What about, uh... Lori and Booger here? Boog. Boog. Fuck them, man. I got Lori over there yapping about giving her boyfriend a handjob at the drive-in, and... Boog here going on and on about how all the girls think he's creepy. Blah-blah-blah. Y'know, but I look at you... and I see someone I could really have a conversation with. Alright look... now listen... you can walk out of here, you know, if you want, you can go home pretend like this all never happened. Or you can hang out and talk. What makes you think I'm this... swell conversationalist? I think you and I are a lot alike. Well, aside for our mutual taste for pussy, I really don't see how you can make that kind of snap judgment on somebody after just meeting them. Well, I can tell. I'm very observant. You know... they say coke makes you hyper observant. [Sniffs coke] - Want some? - No thanks. I try not to do any drug that costs more than my car, okay? No, hey, man, it's cool, I mean, there's no fucking pressure. But if you want, our friend Boog here has a dime bag of some very skunky shit. Now, if I get all fucked up, how am I gonna be able to maintain a decent conversation? - Does that mean you're in? - What the hell. Excellent! I'll roll you one hell of a blunt later, if you want. Alright, now that we've got all that settled, let's move this party to my place in the back. - Your place? - Yeah! That's where the Ouija board is. [Music continues playing] Hey uh... I thought you said you lived with your boyfriend. I did. It seems he's gone for the evening. Wow... that's a shame. Not really. Say... I've got a really good idea. Let's not talk about him, okay? Well, if he shows up, is it gonna be a problem that I'm still here? Like I said, he's gone for the evening. That is, unless you plan on being here after this evening? Hey! I'm just here for the conversation. Um... do you have any spirits? - Spirits? - You know, Crown Royal, that kind of stuff. I thought I'd make us a couple drinks. - Well, you could always try the kitchen. - Oh, okay... - Hmmm. - Well, there you go. Not a lot of variety, sorry. Ah heck, I can make do. You sound awfully sure of yourself. Well, while I was in college, I did a stint as a bartender. Hence, my ability to listen. Bartender! Wow. Hey, uh... do you have any ginger ale? Um... you could always check the fridge... Great, thanks. I make this great concoction with Crown Royal. Knocks you on your ass and you can't even taste it. Well that's a mighty bold statement, especially considering my Irish heritage. Trust me, this drink would knock Superman on his ass. Now, you just go in the living room. The is a closely guarded family secret, if you know what I mean. Oh, okay. You got it. Yeah, perfect. So, what'd you go to college for? Um... I'm a chemist. I, uh... I got snapped right out of Cal Tech. I'm doing some research right now for a cosmetic company. You know, coming up with better kind of lipstick, y'know, that kinda stuff. Well that sounds like it could be pretty interesting. Well, actually I was hoping I'd come up with the cure for cancer. But, I'm in cosmetics for the money. Well, what about you? - Serena? - Oh... Um, I'm, you know, a clerk or something... - What? - Paralegal. I work for one of those law firms. They're big, I get 'em confused a lot. Oh, okay... Voila. Oh, uh... Actually, this one is yours. See, I put a little lemon juice in it, and... actually, I'm very allergic to that. No shit? Yeah, actually it's pretty wild, you should see it, uh... I get the shakes, you know, vomiting, diarrhea, the whole enchilada. Well, that sounds like a way to screw up a perfectly good evening. You're not kiddin'. Why are you being so nice to me? I don't know, I... I guess it's the relationship thing. You know, the stuff you were telling me about your boyfriend... - I could just relate with that. - Because...? Well, it's... it's sorta complicated. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry. Is it bad? Look, uh... I'll tell you what, uh... Why don't we slam a couple more of these, et a good buzz going, and then... maybe I'll feel like talking about it. And this is gonna knock me on my ass, huh? I guarantee it. You gotta ask it a question. Okay... um... Will I ever have a girlfriend? - No. - Boog! You gotta ask a serious question. Like... "Ouija board, Ouija board, will The Smiths ever get back together?" For Chrissake, Lori! Nice place. It's kind of what I kind of pictured Stevie Nicks' pad would always look like. Stevie Nicks. I think I fucked her once. She was nice. So... this is what you do. Get fucked up and play with candles. Hey... don't forget the Ouija board! I don't know... it just seems like a major waste of quality time to me. Well, that all depends on your definition of "quality time". Well correct me if I'm wrong, but I could have swore I heard something about picking apart each other's psyches. I don't know... I-I... just wanted to get laid, that's all. Well, Boog... my funkified little friend... my suggestion is either double up on the whacking off or turn faggot super-quick, 'cause... it ain't happening here. I tried being queer for a while... but... guys don't like me, either. Alright... well, let's... talk about something, like... - How about death? - Yay, that's a good one! Yeah, how 'bout it, Mister Butch... What would a clean-cut guy like you know about death? Ah... I know more than you think I do. Really? Well, shit then... share with the group, Cochise. Yeah, let's just talk about, like... Um... if you died, what would happen, like... Alright, let's not... talk about that, alright? I'm interested in a more serious chat at the moment. Okay. Boog? Anything to add? What? Oh... um... I-I was just gonna say... um, that when I was a kid, uh... none of the girls liked me, but, um... all I wanted to do was to just get married... Great, look... I got an idea. How about the way you would die? If you could choose it? I think it would actually pretty cool if I died from AIDS or something. - What? - Say what?!? Well... that means I would've had sex with someone before I died, you know? Yeah, okay, Boog... you are definitely the last Little Caeser's delivery guy I ever pick up. So anyway, nobody tells me that when gunpowder sweats, it sweats nitroglycerin. So the next time the A-train goes by... ka-blam! The whole west side of my house loses its paint job! [Laughs] Jesus... what did your dad do? He paddled my butt, and he took my Junior Chemistry Set away, that's what he did. [Laughing] - Did you want a refill? - Huh? - Did you want a refill? - Oh, no thanks. Actually, I'm kind of disappointed. Your drink didn't live up to its hype. Well uh... these things take time to kick in. Okay... Actually, you do seem a little bit out of it... Who, me...? Yeah, um... how you feel, Serena? [Sinister music] [Breathing heavy] Something's wrong... Yeah, I know. That little extra-special something I slipped in your drinky-poo is probably just starting to kick in. Some guys, they gotta beat up the women to get 'em to do what they want. Not me. I do it this way and it doesn't spoil the mood. What... What did you do to me? Remember how I told you, uh, I was a chemist? In my spare time, I like to come up my own little concoctions. This one's sort of a sodium amitol-LSD mix I came up with. You... fuck! Yeah. That's just how my ex-wife used to say it. And you're just like her. I mean, I... I loved her. But all she cared about was the money. No sex, no romantic weekends... just how much she could charge on the old Visa. I can remember when she'd be laying next to me in bed with... this little cute little nightie on me. And I couldn't touch her... and I didn't know how to make her let me... you know, touch her. She... aw, hell, enough of my yakkin'. Stop this... She... she had red hair, just like you did. Except, I think you're just a little prettier than she is. I mean, that's why I came over to you back at the bar, I... I figured I could... I could get you home and... and make it so that I could touch you, you know. [Sobbing] Oh... okay? Mommy... Okay? S-S-Serena...? [Panting] I think I'm all better now... Good. I hope I was wrong about you, Serena. You know, I hope that you and I... can still be friends... [Loud crunch] Ow, shit...! You bitch! Ow... Jesus Christ... [Spits] How was that for a little touch, asshole?!? Your turn. - You first. - Me first? Okay... well if I had to pick a way... it would be the same way that Chloe Webb dies at the end of "Sid and Nancy." As much as I hate to admit it, I... think I liked Boog's better. I mean, at least one was more realistic. Yeah. No, think about it. I mean... Nancy Spungen is obsessed with Sid Vicious. Right, so hey get together, they get hooked on heroin... they're both doomed anyway, right? So at the end, after all that shit... He stabs her in the stomach with a knife. And what does she do? Does she hate him for it? Does she freak out and call the cops? - No. - No, she hops into bed with him. Exactly. Man, it appeals to my cynical side... I mean... I think that's what love is really like. I think you got fucking problems. Well, that very well may be. But right now, it's your turn. Well... here's the problem, folks. Unlike all of you... I won't die. Alright, and uh, what makes you immortal? Are you some kind of vampire or something? It's all a matter of choices. All of you choose to be victims. - I don't. - And what about you? I mean, what makes you so all-fucking-superior to me? I'll tell you what... if you got a minute, I'll show you. [Heavy metal music] "It's the Love Boat... la-la-la-la-la-la..." C'mon, Chris, you know the words! "Set a course for..." [Crushes skull] adventure..." Something about a new romance? Something along those lines! Teach him to fuck with us redheads, huh?!? This... is a number two pencil... [Stabbing noise] Ta-da! [Gasping] Omigod! He looks so funny! Shut up, you stupid bitch! Oh, fuck! Hang on, boys and girls, 'cause this part gets even better... Heeeelp!!! Oh, no no, you don't wanna do that, little girl! Who you calling? Man, I'm so fucked-up, I can't even dial the fucking phone... Just like Chloe Webb at the end of "Sid and Nancy," right? Yeah. Just like that. [Knife stab] [Heavy metal music fades out] You fucking bitch! You got blood on my pubes! Oh well... guess I'm free-ballin' it tonight, huh? [Transitional music] [Door opens] Oh, Jesus Christ, Butch! You would not believe the night I just had! Um... yeah... It was insane! Look, um... is this that PMS thing we were talking about before? Because, uh... I thought that shit was a joke... Look, no more fights, okay? At least not until I recover from this one. Sure, uh... you got it. So, uh... what's with all this shit? Well, I sorta had someone over last night. I see. Is he still here? Well... most of him is. Um... I'm gonna go out on a limb here and assume that... all this blood and shit didn't come from a nasty shaving accident. Oh, I'm sorry... I didn't have a chance to clean up. - I mean, I'm still coming down off the acid... - What? Well here, see for yourself. Oh. So... how was your evening, honey? [Sinister music] What? Uh, we have a slight problem. Okay hold on a second, I just stepped out of the shower... Boy, did I need that... - Got a question for you. - Shoot. I was... moving that Chris guy's body out of the living room, and... I just sort of happened to notice that he's missing a chunk out of him. - Uh-huh... - You wouldn't... happen to know where his, um... reproductive organs went to, would you? - What? - You know, his cock, his balls, his piss-pump. I've looked all over the living room, I can't find them. Uh... Uh-hmm... [Spits] I'm not sure... Oh, shit... I think you're gonna have to fix the garbage disposal. I think I busted it last night. You threw his critters in my garbage disposal? What the hell kind of bright idea is that? Well, I'm sorry. I was all freaked out on acid and the last thing I wanted to look at was this guy's ripped-off penis laying around the living room floor. I mean shit, I think at one point it was even talking to me. What, did it say, "Hi, I'm Charlie the Fuckstick and I'm so happy to be here!"? It was a joke!!! Jesus Christ, I don't know what she's all pissed off about... I'm the one that's gotta clean the fucking garbage disposal! Strange days, huh? [Chuckles] The strangest. I wonder what the hell we're gonna do for an encore? Buy Uzis and go apeshit in a Kmart? Seriously! I try not to think that far in advance. Let's find somebody tomorrow. Are you serious? We're really pushing the fucking limit here. Oh, come on, Butch! One more? We'll go someplace real secluded instead of here at the house. You wouldn't even have to dispose of the body. I don't know... We didn't get to do the last one together. If this is gonna be a sacred thing, we gotta do it together, right? Just this one more... we can lay low for awhile. I promise, I won't bug you again. Alright, alright. One more. Thanks, honey. I don't see anybody. I pass this guy every day on my way to work. He'd jog during a nuclear holocaust, trust me. He's silly. Is that him? Hi, there! Hi... So, you having fun out here all by yourself? Having a blast. So tell me, I was just asking my husband... why an attractive gentleman like yourself would be jogging all alone on a day like this. [Chuckles] What are you, the Jogging Police? That's right. The Jogging Police. So you wanna pull over or what? Uh... I'm kind of busy right now... why the heck should I "pull over"? Well, fruity-ass... the sooner you get those bun huggers of yours in the car the sooner I can fuck you like I hate you. [Laughs] Yeah, right, so your husband can beat the shit out me after? Oh, he doesn't fight. He likes to watch. Uh, what did you say your name was again? [Transition sweep] [Door slams] So, what is this place? I used to come here when I was a little girl. It's paradise... if you've got the right attitude. Yeah? - What's he gonna do? - Watch, mostly. Mostly? Man, I ain't doin' nothin' if he starts playing with himself. Don't worry, he won't do anything in front of you. - I might. - He won't. [Sinister music] Well, tough guy... here we are. I have a joint. Well, half a joint; I smoked the other half this morning. I don't know if it's gonna be enough for all three of us. You're jogging and carrying a joint on you? What the hell kind of health program is that The Peter Fonda Workout? [Laughs] Oh man... This is fucked up. Does anyone besides me here find this fucked up? Why don't you light up that joint, huh? Okay, what the hell... [Pulls knife out] Knew I had you in there somewhere... [Serena screams] Get the fuck up, asshole! You're not fucking dead yet!! Come on! [Throws knife] [Hitchhiker cries in pain] Are you out of your fucking mind, you crazy bitch? [Music crescendos] [Throws crowbar] You know, I think it's time we re-evaluated this relationship. [Punch] [Dramatic music] [Kick] [Pulls knife out] You still feelin' froggy, huh? You still feeling 7-Up? Because we can dance all day if you want to. [Knife slashes] [Knife stab] [Knife cuts flesh] [Guts splat] Figures! I yell at you for stabbing somebody in the stomach and then I go and fucking do it. That's fucked up. Help! [Sets off car alarm] Oh, shit... [Car alarm continues] Oh for Christ's sakes, get up! [Stabs hand] [Serena screams] Asshole! [Pulls hand off blade] [Fast-paced music] [Slashes Butch] [Butch moans in pain] [Butch starts laughing] Now, what are you gonna do? [Crowbar impact] [Coughs blood] [Music faster] Hey! [Crowbar impact] What's this crawling away shit, huh? [Kicks Serena] I mean, you really think you're gonna get away from me, do ya? I mean, I'm no doctor... but I'd say you're pretty fucked up right now. Don't you think? [Cocks gun] - Enough. - Huh? [Gunshot] Fuck! [Three gunshots] [Butch moans] [Serena drops gun[ [Serena panting] How you doin' over there, pumpkin? [Slow music begins] Stick a fork in me, I'm done... You don't even remember, do you? What? That wasn't my so-called "friend" you killed two years ago. [Unzips shirt] It was my mother. Me and my mother. Y'know, the funny thing is... I didn't even know it was you until you went on to kill all the other people and the police couldn't find you. And when nobody could help me... when nobody could make things the way they were before that night... I decided it was time... to come look for you myself. Why the big production number, huh? Why didn't you just... shoot me when we first met? Oh, no. I had to show you. Show you what I learned from you. How to kill. How to like it. How to like it enough to kill you... [Drops crowbar] Oh fuck it, I'm hurtin'... [Butch laughs] What's so funny? I'm not Butch Harlow. What? I really am Walt Lipsky. It's just that... it's just that you came to the house and you were attractive you thought I was this Butch Harlow character, so I played along. You committed murder for me...? Why would you do that? I just thought it would be neat to kill a couple people, that's all. [Butch & Serena laugh in pain] Oh, Jesus! Oh God and baby Jesus! You never killed anybody before you met me? Well, I might have hit a dog with my car once... [Both laugh] Oh, God, am I a bad influence... Uh-huh, yeah... [Flies buzzing] I love you... I love you, too. [Flies buzzing] [Country music plays]
