(♪♪♪) [snarls] (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) [infected shriek] (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) [snarls] (♪♪♪) [creature snarling in distance] (♪♪♪) [creature continues snarling] (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) [Hawk pants] (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) But it's a proposal, man. It's supposed to be a surprise. Dude, Ton. You have been with Crystal for six years. Yes. Yes. And in those six years, how many times have I told you She does not like surprises. Exactly. You know, he's right, man. Kids like surprises. Not adults. Dude, what if she says, "No"? Uh, it could happen. And then if she says, "No," you're gonna be stuck, trapped in Tahiti. But it's Tahiti. It's paradise. Even in paradise, you can feel trapped. [grunts] MASTER CHIEF: Ain't that the truth? Just ask any of my ex-wives. [chuckles] TOC right now, gentlemen. We have an immediate problem. (♪♪♪) MASTER CHIEF: CDC contracted a lab in this little one-horse town for vaccine development. Four weeks ago, it was declared a D-Zone. Your mission is to infil that lab and secure that prototype vaccine. And then haul-ass onto the extraction point. So, we suit up, grab and go. Where's the problem? MASTER CHIEF: Well, the problem is that intel informs us that some of the infected are surviving the blast. Yeah, that's right. MASTER CHIEF: Apparently, these sons of bitches are silent, faster, and more aggressive than any runners that you've exterminated in the past. So, this, uh... prototype vaccine must be some kind of Messiah shot. Why aren't the brass sending in a full battalion? To redirect several hundred troops to extract an unproven vaccine from a D-Zone that's swarming with infected sup'ed-up assholes? No. That'd be more like genocide than a game plan. What I need, a few canaries to slip in, sniff around, and sneak out undetected. Canaries? No. Maybe that was a bad example. What do you think? Yep, you'll HALO in via this baby. Now, don't get excited. I know it's not the prettiest horse in the barn. Little long in the tooth, but it's got all the luck where it's needed. Plus, it's the best I could do on such short notice. Kinda like you guys. This mission far exceeds any threat assessment of any mission you've been on already. You're gonna be jumpin' straight into hell. If you're lookin' for a glory day, this is it. A lot of good lives will be saved. You wanna be part of the solution, you get your frog-man on, you suit up, and you follow me. You each have to call it for yourselves on this one. (♪♪♪) Man, fuck Tahiti. No surprises. MASTER CHIEF: Most of this equipment, you gentlemen are familiar with. You've used it in a previous tour of deployments. But if you look around, you'll notice, I got you a few new extra toys. Pack a little extra punch in case you find yourselves in a hot spot. TON: Thermo, really? But I thought they already nuked the town. Speakin' of which, how are we supposed to breathe in that poison? AJAX: With this. MASTER CHIEF: The filters and batteries have been modified from the SEAL rebreathers. By the way, the more you move, the better they work. And if it gives you any trouble, I'll be right there to fix it. Unless you desert me again. Deserter? Now, that's a new low even for you. It is what it is... Boss. If memory serves, I had an easy choice, stay with your sorry ass or go home with the most beautiful woman I've ever been with in my life. All right. You win. I always win. Fellas, allow me to introduce you to Chief Petty Officer Ajax. My BUDs classmate, drinking buddy, and before he transferred to an R&D desk job, was nearly my brother-in-law. Your sister broke my heart, you know? Is she seein' anyone right now? Hey, hey, hey. Don't get your ass kicked-- Boss! That's enough. Knock it off. Ajax, get him in his battle rattle. AJAX: Helmets are new. -You'll be the first ones to use 'em. -Lucky us. So, you're tellin' me this thin-ass fabric is gonna keep me from roastin'? That's the idea. MASTER CHIEF: Now, this particular configuration is hot off the factory floor. So, unfortunately, well, we haven't had a lot of time to test it considering the situation. But it has been modified for Dead Zone ops. Fully-suppressed firearms. Every effort to keep us concealed and your life has been made. MASTER CHIEF: Lock and load, gentlemen. Masks on. Whoa! Gunnery Sergeant Sinclair. Sergeant first-class Ton. P.O.S.C Danner, check. Good coms. On your visors, you got a basic HUD. On your ears, you got an AMP system for suit-to-suit comms and increased audibility. Soft sounds become loud, loud becomes soft. Now, each helmet is completely soundproofed to the Zone. You could blow your vocal cords, and we're the only ones that'll hear it. That's comforting. And one more trick up your sleeve is a last resort. 500,000 lumens, 2K throw. Powerful enough to permanently blind, hot enough to start a fire at close range. Ten-second burst. I will emphasize, "last resort." What about a close-quarters encounter? We still don't know how all this holds up in actual combat. Oh, you want a test run? Don't you? You've had this coming for a long time. [Boss pants] (♪♪♪) [grunts] Still works. Yeah, that's the Ajax I know. [Ajax grunts] [Boss groans, pants] (♪♪♪) [grunts] [Ajax groans] What, you forget... [groans] ...I always win. MASTER CHIEF: All right. That's enough fun for now. What do you say, Boss? I think we can use all the help we can get. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) Danner and Master Chief will be on three comms windows. On touchdown, pass Sitting Bull. When I verify and secure the vaccines, pass Geronimo. Once we reach the EZ, our final pass is Crazy Horse. Chief will send a taxi. And radiation is a rough way to go. So, make sure you stay covered up at all times. Got 90 seconds, and that's it. That's all we got, huh? They said it's like drowning... in fire. You really haven't taken one of these into a D-Zone before? But if they don't work, the good news is you'll be dead before you hit the ground. DANNER: Well, it's a shame really. We straight up poison the world. That's why we gotta get these shots. Until then, we gotta keep droppin' bombs. Damned if we do, damned if we don't. Kinda like us canaries. 30 seconds to drop. (♪♪♪) You're never out of the fight. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) DANNER: Ironside Main, this is Archangel. Do you copy? Over. Ironside Main, Ironside Main, this is Archangel Actual. Pass Sitting Bull. Over. MASTER CHIEF: Roger, Actual. This is Master Chief on Main. Sitting Bull confirmed. Check in at your next waypoint. Have a safe walk. Over. DANNER: Boss, Master Chief confirmed. Radiation's already messing with the signal. AI is adjusting. You've set it. Now, you can forget it. BOSS: Sounds too good to be true. DANNER: Coast is clear. BOSS: You ready? SINCLAIR: Yes, sir. We've got two clicks at about one-eight-zero. BOSS: Take it out. [breathes deeply] (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) BOSS: Ton, what do you see? TON: Still fresh. I'd say one day, maybe less. Looks like they used a two-shot on a one-time-rig. The M84s blew the windows to alert the infected, then they cooked the incoming with thermite. AJAX: That's clever. BOSS: Go ahead, and see what you can find. [Ton sighs] I don't know, Boss. I got that funny feelin'. Roger that. (♪♪♪) Pull and stop a second, boys. (♪♪♪) BOSS: What you got, Sinclair? I got cadaveric spasms over here. This thing looks like it went down maybe three hours ago. Something's not right. It don't look shot up at all. Christ! This thing's still movin'. Does it see you? I don't know. Boss, am I canceling this thing or what? BOSS: Negative. Do not engage unless the threat is immediate. SINCLAIR: What the hell? I think something else took this thing out. AJAX: We need to push to waypoint 2. Danner? DANNER: Hundred-yard diameter. All clear. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) DANNER: Ton, clear! (♪♪♪) [snarls] BOSS: You guys okay down there? TON: We're good. Just had to smoke a runner. AJAX: Possible jackpot. Simulation room, level two. (♪♪♪) This room is operating on its own insulated power. Air quality is good. [sighs] Thank God. You gettin' enough air in yours? How we lookin'? Geronimo. Good. Danner? Get the comms to Main. On it. Ton? 15 clicks to the EZ. You want Ajax to take a look at your gear? I'm all good, Boss. These shots are on a six-hour clock. BOSS: That puts us at dawn 5:30. We hustle, we can make it in three. Good. Because if the cryo on this storage unit dies, radiation poisons all hope. Well, then we have to keep hope alive. Boss, we got a problem. (♪♪♪) DANNER: Ironside Main, Ironside Main, this is Archangel Actual. How copy. Over. Ironside Main, come on! Piece of shit. [breathes deeply] DANNER: Ironside Main, Ironside Main. This is Archangel Actual. How copy. Over. Guys, we got a movement signature at 15 meters. My zero-four-five. AJAX: Danner. Can you manual closer? DANNER: Signal's gettin' choppy. (♪♪♪) Oh, I cannot get this-- Damn this tech! Boss, what are we doin'? BOSS: Hold the line. Get ready. [infected snarling in distance] Here they come. (♪♪♪) BOSS: On me. (♪♪♪) Contact. SINCLAIR: Let's go! Come on! Bring it! Fuck! Go! DANNER: Hold it! Hold it! slow down, bitch! Ah, you keep coming! Damn, fucker, you're good. TON: Damn thing don't stop! [snarling] [infected snarls] [Boss grunts] [groans] They're getting back up. [infected 1 groans] DANNER: Shit, shit, shit! [groans] BOSS: Help Danner! D, behind you! DANNER: Oh, God! SINCLAIR: Who the hell is this? DANNER: Oh, my arm is burning! BOSS: Lock down the perimeter. [Danner groans] BOSS: You just hang in there, buddy. DANNER: Oh, it burns! SINCLAIR: Oh, man. That's bad. That's real deep, Boss. BOSS: How long has he got? -AJAX: A few minutes maybe. -[groans] DANNER: It burns! AJAX: Are we really gonna follow this guy? BOSS: We need to get Danner to cover. AJAX: Well, this situation is FUBAR. [snarls] (♪♪♪) [Danner groans] We need to act fast. The spray has breached the tourniquet. -We could amputate. -GOODMAN: It's too late for that. DANNER: I'll do it. Ton, please. I'll do it. SINCLAIR: You know what? Fuck this! We lose the arm. It's the only shot he's got. GOODMAN: You use that, he bleeds out, and dies. Either way, he dies. -AJAX: Hey, we don't know that. -[Danner panting] DANNER: Look. I can feel it. I can feel my skin. [grunts] -Danner. -[pants] It's your call. Do you wanna do it? DANNER: Where's my-- where's my-- where's my bag? Where is my bag lost? Geronimo, we got 'em. BOSS: He's not gonna make it. DANNER: Geronimo, Geronimo, we got 'em left. Geronimo. Wait, wait, wait. What the hell are you doing? Human trials. [Danner groaning] BOSS: All right, get ready. Hold him down. DANNER: Archangel. Archangel. -BOSS: Okay, Danner. -[Danner groaning] A little pinch. [whimpers, groans] [grunts] (♪♪♪) [breathes shakily] (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) [grunts] DANNER: Oh, Jesus! DANNER: What the hell just happened? What the hell just happened? All right. TON: He's all right? No spreads, bro. BOSS: Ton. Get a signal out. This bunker's too insulated and the outside atmosphere's too thick. Then we need to get these. And you wanna move now. Congratulations, Danner. You ass just became an essential mission objective. Yeah, it's about time. [groans] Thank you, miss... Goodman. So, you're packing miracles? BOSS: Now, we just need to get 'em out. -[groans] -BOSS: How you feelin'. -[groans] -Terrible. You have some impressive skillsets. -BOSS: Hmm. -Not dead yet. BOSS: Ammo check. You triggered the car? My brother did. AJAX: Where's he at? Dead. Boss, we're ready. But we're chewing through a lot of ammo real fast. I don't think we can stomach another large encounter. You need ammo, I got it. Not caseless. You can always stand behind me. DANNER: She should come with us. She saved my life. We don't have a helmet for her. I can take care of myself. What I mean is this isn't a personnel recovery op. Well, it kind of is now. AJAX: For you, yes. Not for her. -She puts us all at risk. -[scoffs] You've been in this hell, what, a few hours? Woke up the neighborhood, burned through three-quarters of your ammo. GOODMAN: Another pinch, and your chances of survival drop to less than zero. I've survived here a month. And tonight, I fired my first shot to save one of your asses. AJAX: So, why are you still here? 'Cause I'm afraid of what's out there. We tried to escape and failed. When I heard that explosion, I thought maybe you guys were my second shot. Starting to have my doubts. She's coming with us. We need all the help we can get. Sinclair, map. Now, we've got just over five hours to get to our extraction point due west. If we get into a firefight or have to fall back, we'll need a fortified location. The only thing over there is an old tunnel system under the train station. You to stick to me like glue. Understand? You are a ghost, unseen and unheard. Got me? Yes, sir. Anything else? BOSS: Yeah. Don't forget your mask. Let's go. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) DANNER: I'll scout ahead. TON: Yeah, this is perfect. Let's set up here. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) Ironside Main. Ironside Main. How copy. Over. Boss, I'm not getting anything. BOSS: Danner. You gotta get the signal out. DANNER: It's not even static now. Fallout may have fried it. [sighs] DANNER: Good to go. BOSS: All right. Pack it up. Let's move to a safe spot. Sinclair? Coming over. Stay low. I got a prowler out here. (♪♪♪) [pants] SINCLAIR: They're hiding in the shadows. I've got my eyes on three. My gut's tellin' me there's more. BOSS: Place is infested. SINCLAIR: I can put 'em down. BOSS: We can't afford risks. -AJAX: We set the trap, let's blow it. -[Boss sighs] TON: Thermo would cook us here. We gotta get at least one click away. BOSS: Can you make it that far? [Ton pants] [infected snarling in distance] AJAX: I can try to increase the flow, but I'll have to remove the helmet. Air might be clean in those tunnels. (♪♪♪) [infected continue snarling in distance] (♪♪♪) [pants] BOSS: Easy, Ton. We're almost there. [panting continues] (♪♪♪) AJAX: Okay, we're lucky. Air's getting cleaner. [Ton panting] TON: I can't... I can't breathe. AJAX: Ton, wait. Ton? Fuck it. BOSS: Jax, how long? AJAX: Few minutes. BOSS: You and Goodman go back to the entry. Make sure nothing comes down. SINCLAIR: Roger that. SINCLAIR: Danner and I will scout ahead. Make sure there's a back door. On me. [Ajax panting] (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) [Boss grunts] (♪♪♪) AJAX: You guys all right down there? BOSS: Can't go a block in this D-Zone without running into infected. Never out a fight. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) [pants] (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) SINCLAIR: We've got some activity out here. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) DANNER: Hey, I got a blocked passage here. Right tunnel. I repeat, right tunnel is blocked. Boss, do you want me to join you? All right. Yeah, head over-- Danner. Ajax? Boss? Ajax? Danner? Danner. AJAX: I think we just lost him. All call now. DANNER: Danner, check. SINCLAIR: Sinclair, check. (♪♪♪) [Boss groans, coughs] DANNER: Boss, do you copy? Boss, do you copy? [groans, coughs] DANNER: Boss. Hang on, man. I'm on my way! [groans] (♪♪♪) [pants] (♪♪♪) BOSS: Oh, goddamn it. DANNER: What the hell happened? BOSS: My helmet's working now. Jesus. That air is like drinking napalm. DANNER: Yeah, I do not know about this beta tech. BOSS: We have a back exit. DANNER: Should've grabbed Goodman's old school masks. (♪♪♪) BOSS: Try the radio. We might be able to get a signal out. DANNER: Copy. (♪♪♪) I definitely have one. 50 meters south side. SINCLAIR: Contact. I got one tango down. (♪♪♪) [infected snarling in distance] There's something weird out here. BOSS: Hang tight. We'll be right there. [infected snarls] Done. We're on our way. TON: Much better. DANNER: Ironside Main, do you copy? Over. Now that's an improvement. Boss, I got infected running around back here. Lock that door, and fall back to Sinclair now. DANNER: Roger that. (♪♪♪) SINCLAIR: I think there's something else out here. BOSS: Hang on, Sinclair. Hang on. (♪♪♪) [groans] (♪♪♪) [grunts] (♪♪♪) Do you hear me? Are you okay? Yes. BOSS: Did you see what happened to Sinclair? GOODMAN: No. TON: He's out there. AJAX: Without a helmet. DANNER: So, what? We just gonna leave him behind? He's dead, brother. DANNER: You don't know that. AJAX: You wanna take your helmet off and see what happens? BOSS: Ajax is right. If he doesn't have his helmet, he's gone. Make your peace with it. You know, if we wanna make his sacrifice count, we stay with the mission. We get these vaccines out. (♪♪♪) BOSS: Let's set the trap. DANNER: Check. (♪♪♪) TON: Oh, yeah. That should keep 'em busy. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) DANNER: You wanna get a call out? Up there's gonna be our best bet. BOSS: Last chance. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) DANNER: Ironside Main. Do you copy? Over. (♪♪♪) GOODMAN: You guys hear that buzzing? (♪♪♪) GOODMAN: It's coming from over here. (♪♪♪) BOSS: Ton, you see anything up there? It's just the wind. Town's dead, Boss. BOSS: Tell Danner he's got two more minutes. Make it count. This is Archangel Actual. Do you copy? Over. (♪♪♪) Ironside Main, this is Archangel Actual. Geronimo. Repeat. Geronimo. We're headed to EZ. How copy. Over. (♪♪♪) MASTER CHIEF: Repeat, good copy, Actual. Geronimo. I'm sending the-- [Danner groans] BOSS: Ton, what's happening? TON: Danner's freaking out. [groans] TON: Wait, wait. Dan, wait! (♪♪♪) TON: You okay, man? [Danner grunts] DANNER: Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Boss... I got the call out. -Master Chief confirmed. -BOSS: Good. This damn AMP system blew my ears out. BOSS: Danner, you all right? DANNER: Yeah, we are good to go, Boss. BOSS: Hustle down. Let's move before we get overrun. DANNER: Copy that. [Ton gasps] DANNER: Ton. [breathes heavily] Ton! [grunts] (♪♪♪) [screams] GOODMAN: Danner? Danner? You okay? BOSS: There's no sign of Ton anywhere. What's Danner's status? GOODMAN: Unchanged. AJAX: Hardass fell three stories and he's still breathin'. That's one lucky bastard. GOODMAN: He could be hemorrhaging internally. Paralyzed, braindead. Danner's is gonna make it, 'cause we're gonna help him. GOODMAN: We'll need a stretcher. Where are the infected? We should be overrun by now. BOSS: What in God's name... Boss, what you got? You okay? BOSS: I found a finger. DANNER: Jesus! [pants] GOODMAN: Danner's up. BOSS: Danner, you all right? Can you hear me? Yeah, I'm okay. I can hear you. Where's Ton? GOODMAN: Hey, hey, hey. Careful. Take it easy. -[Danner groans] -BOSS: Jax, take a look at this. DANNER: Well, my radio is busted. AJAX: What the hell are we dealing with? BOSS: It's not Ton's finger. And infected don't make noise. AJAX: We need to take this back. If there's a variant strain of the virus that's this mutated, HQ's gotta know. DANNER: I got the signal out. AJAX: We're gonna be tight. BOSS: We'll make it. But first, we're gonna find Ton. DANNER: This is a bad idea. AJAX: I agree. We're burning time we don't have. Unlike Sinclair, Ton still has a helmet on. No way Ton could just vanish off a tower. You two, hustle and check back up top. Danner, you clear the base with me and tell us everything. DANNER: It wasn't like the other infected. Then what was it? DANNER: I don't know what it was. But it was-- it was enormous. He had something wrapped around his neck. It picked him up. I thought it came from the AMP speakers. But it came from that thing like it was-- like it was a scream from hell. Look, we're getting torn apart out here. GOODMAN: Nothing. AJAX: Not a sign, Boss. Whatever it was, it took him off this tower. DANNER: No, no. No, man. He has got to be nearby. If he's nearby, has his helmet, and isn't talking to us, he's dead. DANNER: We gotta find it. And we gotta kill it. AJAX: We were not deployed on some revenge hunt, Danner. What we need to do is get outta here faster. He's gone, man. [Danner sighs] GOODMAN: I might have an option. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) GOODMAN: That's the pack with the battery. And that's my brother. DANNER: This feels like a trap. AJAX: It's the Dead Zone. It's all a trap. Sit tight. AJAX: Hey. You go, we go, Boss. BOSS: Think I'm gonna desert you, Jax? On me. Danner get a rating. If it's bad, we start running. You can handle that? DANNER: Hooah, Boss. BOSS: Hey. Goodman. You okay? GOODMAN: Let's get the hell outta here. (♪♪♪) BOSS: I got a bad feelin' about this. [creature snarling in distance] AJAX: You hear that buzzing? BOSS: What the hell is it? (♪♪♪) [Goodman sighs] GOODMAN: I'm sorry. (♪♪♪) [breathes heavily] GOODMAN: Okay. Ajax. Here's the key. (♪♪♪) [creature snarling in distance] There's something out here. BOSS: No shit. Keep sharp, Jax. (♪♪♪) DANNER: It got juice. BOSS: We're exposed here. Let's go there. (♪♪♪) GOODMAN: There she is. You sure it'll run? Yes, sir. It was my brother's. Only reliable thing in here. AJAX: So, what's it doing here? GOODMAN: Backup for this exact situation. DANNER: Gotta love the vintage models. No major electronics outside the radio. GOODMAN: Just needs the battery. (♪♪♪) BOSS: Get it done. (♪♪♪) Ajax. How sure are you on these masks holding out? AJAX: 40 percent. It's the only reason I'm onboard with this plan. I don't like 'em either. But we're pretty slim on choices out here. DANNER: We could hit the bunker. Goodman can hook us up with some of her surplus masks. GOODMAN: It's an option. We'd have to take a detour. Leave the truck running. BOSS: Yeah, that's a negative. We're already backtracking, and losing time. Once we get this running, we're not stopping. DANNER: Ready. BOSS: Goodman. You know this truck and these streets. You're drivin'. Danner, shotgun. Jax, with me. We're about to make a racket. So, we'll have to act quick. (♪♪♪) BOSS: On three, Goodman, you'll fire it up. We'll open the door. GOODMAN: Here goes nothing. BOSS: One... two... [exhales deeply] ...three. GOODMAN: Come on, you piece of shit! What the... [Goodman grunts] BOSS: Get down! [infected snarls] DANNER: That was it. [pants] DANNER: That is what I saw with Ton. BOSS: We got a dent. AJAX: What the hell did it do to the power? (♪♪♪) AJAX: It looks human. BOSS: Humans don't climb on ceilings and crush trucks. GOODMAN: Stack up. We're getting out of here. Holy shit! (♪♪♪) Where the hell did they go? BOSS: Spread out. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) BOSS: Oh, shit! GOODMAN: I don't have a clean shot. [infected 1 snarls] [groans] (♪♪♪) GOODMAN: Boss! Goodman, help him! [Goodman grunts] [snarls] (♪♪♪) [shrieks] AJAX: Gotta close that door. Cover me. Over there! Boss, you gotta inject. Do it! Do it. GOODMAN: All right. [gasps] [gasps, pants] I'm drying my main. [Goodman grunts] AJAX: Over there! Turn! There's one. [Goodman grunts] (♪♪♪) [pants] (♪♪♪) [Boss grunts] [pants] AJAX: Glad to have you back, Boss. BOSS: Here. Make it count. (♪♪♪) AJAX: Thanks. [creature snarling in distance] AJAX: This is bad. BOSS: Let's get the hell out of here. On me. GOODMAN: What about that thing? I don't wanna go down there. -BOSS: We're boxed in. -GOODMAN: Yeah, with that thing. AJAX: Goodman. We will not wait for you. GOODMAN: Then go. BOSS: If we stick together, we can help each other. DANNER: Yeah. Just look at where that's gotten us. BOSS: Last chance. [Goodman breathes deeply] GOODMAN: Good luck. BOSS: To you, too. [creature snarling in distance] (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) [Goodman pants] (♪♪♪) BOSS: Ceilings and sixes. [grunts, pants] [grunts] (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) [creature snarling in distance] West side is clear. All right. Coming to you. Ajax, where you at? AJAX: Almost there. DANNER: Boss, I'll take point. And then we-- [gasps, groans] Danner. Danner, what's happening? [snarls] Boss! [growls] AJAX: D! [screams] [groans] [groans] [groans] [creature snarling] [pants] (♪♪♪) [pants] [creature snarling in distance] (♪♪♪) AJAX: -I got you. -[Danner groans] -DANNER: I can't. -AJAX: I got you. I got you. [Danner groans] [breathes heavily] -BOSS: You didn't copy. -DANNER: I'm so sorry. It got me. BOSS: What do you mean by that? [Danner groaning] -What do you want us to do? -[Danner breathes heavily] DANNER: Just take-- just take the damn helmet off. I want it off. [groans] DANNER: Boss. I can't-- I can't hear anything, bo... Boss, I can't... [breathes shakily] I'm sorry, Boss. BOSS: He wants our blood. Fastest way out now is to make sure we have one less obstacle. What do you have in mind? BOSS: We're gonna bait it. Blow it straight to hell. With Danner? BOSS: With his blood. It's what he would want. GOODMAN : It doesn't seem right. BOSS: It's not right. It's revenge. AJAX: You knew this thing was out here, didn't you, Goodman? It killed your brother. GOODMAN: I wasn't certain what it was then. I'm still not. BOSS: That makes three of us. The only thing that makes me appreciate death is the certainty of it. If we can get these vaccines out, maybe it'll take us back to a time where we had more certainty in life. (♪♪♪) GOODMAN: Even with the vaccine, we're still not gonna save everyone. BOSS: No, we won't. But they can use all the help we can give 'em. (♪♪♪) AJAX: Boss, whatever this thing is, it isn't takin' the bait. BOSS: You wanna just walk out of here? AJAX: No. I'm just saying the cryo's running low and the chief's chopper's not gonna wait long. BOSS: What happens if we fail? AJAX: They build a new vaccine based on your blood. It'll take a lot longer than if we get a stable dose to the CDC. You wanna help people? Then we need to take action, now. (♪♪♪) [creature snarling in distance] Stay in the shadows. AJAX: Goodman, you stay here. Boss, I'm coming to you. BOSS: Stay sharp, Jax. It's here. My God. -BOSS: Jax. -[creature growls] [grunts] Jax, hold on. I'm coming. [grunts, groans] BOSS: Jax, hold on. Jax, come in. Where are you? Jax? Jax, where are you? GOODMAN: Boss, over here. BOSS: No, Jax. No, no. AJAX: It is what it is. BOSS: Jax! AJAX: Give me the detonator. BOSS: -I'm not gonna desert you. -AJAX: Hell with that. [pants] AJAX: I got this. It's too late. -BOSS: Where is it? -AJAX: Go. And let me-- [groans] AJAX: Stop. Stop. Please. You can't help me now. But let me help you... help you win. [groans] AJAX: Never. BOSS: Never. Hooah, my brother. Come on, Goodman. (♪♪♪) [creature snarling in distance] (♪♪♪) Shit. [groans] [inhales sharply, groans] [screams] Run! [groans] [shrieks] GOODMAN: Boss, can you hear me? Boss, stay with me? Boss? Can you hear me? Boss. Boss, can you hear me? Boss, stay with me. Boss. Boss. Boss, we gotta go. Boss, we gotta go. AJAX (VO): You're gonna be killed and straight in hell. MASTER CHIEF (VO): A lot of good lives will be saved. If you're looking for a glory day, this is it. [infected snarling] BOSS (VO): Here they come. AJAX (VO): Let me help you win. BOSS (VO): The only thing that makes me appreciate death... is the certainty of it. -TON (VO): Thermo? -[infected snarling] TON (VO): But I thought they already nuked the town. SINCLAIR (VO): There's something weird out here. [Boss groaning] It is what it is. Boss. DANNER (VO): We're getting torn apart out here. Well, it's a shame really. Straight up poison the world. AJAX (VO): That's why we gotta get these shots. So, you're packing miracles? BOSS (VO): I'll end it. [indistinct speech] [chuckling] DANNER (VO): Boss. God dang. Type O. My luck continues. You know what they say. It's gonna run out sometime. Back in the bunker? What are you, a buck o' five? How'd you drag me all the way here? Ten years in the military, you pick up a few tricks of the trade. -What time? -Just rest up for now. Let the blood do its work. Come dawn, we can try to get out of here again. Choppers won't wait that long. GOODMAN: Hey. Careful, careful. [Boss grunts] And listen, Goodman. We got-- GOODMAN: Hey, don't touch it. Just keep it covered. That thing didn't like you very much. Feeling's mutual. It was humanoid. That was not a human. We don't know that. There's a lot we don't know, isn't there? Like what it is, where it came from. If there's more out there in this D-Zone or others. Beginning to think Danner was right. About what? That we poisoned the world. Poison. That thing was about to drain Danner, but it stopped. Stopped with you, too. It can't take the antigens. Do you have more of these? Our first plan almost worked. We gotta trap this creature. And if we can't, we kill it. Okay. So, what do we know about this thing? It likes blood. Not vaccinated blood. Maybe it carries the virus. Doesn't like light. Feels pain. First thing we need to do is make our guest feel nice and welcome. Lay out the scent of blood. Draw it deep inside. We need it dark in here. Once it's deep enough, we hit it. [grunts] The bunker's got one door. Keep it open. Its one way in is our way out. We attack. Trigger the trap within the trap. What if we can't kill it? We leave that to the professionals. Isn't that us? You take the vaccine. Worst case, I keep that thing here with me while you make it to the EZ. Doubles our chances.
