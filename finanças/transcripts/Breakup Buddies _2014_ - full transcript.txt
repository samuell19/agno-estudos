Mr. Geng? Mr. Geng? Divorce Agreement Tattoo: Quit Smoking Take a message to her. I've split all possessions with her. Half and half. Fair and square. Mr. Geng, my client wants you to know she's happy to give up whatever she's entitled to. I'm sorry to notify you so late. Give it up? As far as I know, the law says a couple's possessions should be split upon divorce. She thinks she lives above the law? The law allows her to relinquish all claims. Is it right to sleep with a rich guy? Does the law say if you are rich, you can seduce somebody else's wife, or send a pretentious jerk like you to my home and teach me the law? Take a message to your master, if a rich guy takes a hammer blow to the head, will he bleed like a poor guy? Mr. Geng, to answer your question, we'll have to talk about the criminal law. If you need, we do provide criminal defense. By the way, we call them "clients", not "masters". Hey, pal. Do you have a lighter? What? A lighter. Thanks. Fuck. You've got some guts. You've watched too many violent movies. Geng Hao? Yes, miss. I just won an award. The most promising producer of the year. Your hand. Listen to me. This is your wife. This is you. And this is her lover. You just killed him. Then what? Then the police will come, and you'll be arrested. Then you'll be sentenced to death. You think she will cry for the rest of her life? No! A big plate of guys will be there for her! -Are you trying to do them a favor? -Call me when it's done. -May I tell you something, miss? -What? You stuck the wrong guy. He's the patient, not me. Why didn't you tell me earlier? You're so beautiful that I couldn't resist. Oh, no. I'm dizzy at the sight of the needle. I already removed the needle. Oh, no. I'm dizzy at the sight of you, beauty. -You're so sick. Press it. -I know you hate me. That's why you stuck me, not him. What are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? Stop acting like a loser. In the hospital... Enough. It's over. It's over. I've lost everything. What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me? This is something a bunny girl like you, Little Lolita princess, will never understand. Have you heard of "mid-life crisis?" I'm in a very difficult divorce, which breaks my heart terribly. You know how much I took last night? I was taken to pumped my stomach! Have you ever had your stomach pumped before? You wouldn't feel a thing. It felt like I'd vomit all my guts out. Stop this bullshit! Hold on. You almost gave me a heart attack, jerk. Come on. Get dressed. I don't want to talk to naked people. When did you get circumcised? That's neat. Go to hell. I should stitch your mouth up. Where are we going? Bunny girl. What do you think of her? Isn't she hot? -Where are we going? -To meet the bunny girl. Make a U-turn now. U-turn my ass. I'm shipping props for crew! -Hey, turn around. -Come with me. Take a break. -Turn around! Stop messing! -Stop hitting my head, all right? -Turn around! -Fuck! Are you fucking crazy? Fuck! What the hell is this? Your pants? Did you wash it? Must go home now. Juice is waiting. Juice is right here with you. Where the hell are you going? You think I have nothing better to do? I am a fucking producer, all right? I could tell you're going nuts. Either a jail or insane asylum's there, if you go back... If you come, there are Barbies along the next 3000 kilometers. What do you choose? Let me show you the photo. See? This is the same girl. But she looks so different in these two photos. Look at her breasts. Any differences in these two? So what makes the difference? You nuts or what? No. This is called the "shadow effect". For real. In photography, the more you emphasize the shadows, the more interesting the space becomes. Now you're in the shadow of life. But the shadow is also part of your life. Walk out of the shadow, all right? Who's in the shadow, you or me? Stay cool in your shadow. Leave me alone. Where is my mobile? All from Kang Xiaoyu. 16 missed calls 116 messages I called you, but you didn't answer. No matter what, I'm grateful that you signed the document. I truly hope you can be happy, too. From my heart. Not heading back? Are you? Look at you! Take this. You'll find it useful. There are other trees in the forest! Find yourself a new tree!

Mr. Cock Boom What's the matter? What took you so long? Little Turtle left me. So Little turtle... Little Turtle left you. Where did it go? It's a goldfish? His name is Little Turtle. You obviously didn't read my message carefully? Hi, Little Turtle. Why did they all leave me? They're all dead. The whole world has left me. Are you gotta stand there forever? What? Are you really 28? You said you were 28, too. But look 40. I mean, are you 18 or what? Don't tell me you're underage. As friends, we need to know... Open your eyes and see! I was born in 1994. No, no. I don't have to see that. Don't get me wrong. I'm sorry about Little Turtle... He's dead, and I... I... I came late... Get out of here. Get out. -What's going on? -Get out! What did I do wrong? Wait... What's going on? I thought we were having a good time! I'm his friend. Mr. Cocky. What happened? Tell me, I'll kick his ass! Go ask him. What he said yesterday? I know. He told you he'd go to kiss Justin Bieber for you, right? No, not that. Then what? Tell me. What is the foundation of our relationship? -Our relationship? -Trust. Trust is the foundation. Did you show our messages to the others? Come on. We're best friends. Listen carefully. Since you don't trust me, I won't trust you either. Come on... If we want to fool you, we didn't have to drive a long way here from Beijing. You said you're from Beijing, maybe it's a lie. Honestly, we drove here from Beijing. Have you heard of West BJ? I know East BJ, an online shopping site. Come to West BJ, if you dream of becoming a hairdresser. If you don't know West BJ, how can you claim to be Beijinger? Gee. Liar. Fine. Come here. I'll prove it to you. I am from Beijing... All right? Real enough? Look at you! You claim yourself a cosplayer? At best a cockplayer. You called me a cockplayer? Yes, she's right! You were, then started to go against the flow, now dream to be a cosplayer! Whatever you say, I will never trust you! Let me prove! Then wear the same earring as mine, to be a real cosplayer. That won't be necessary... I know you won't. I will! Make it then, will you? What if I do it? Bet what? You'll get me. Dare? Why not? Not kidding? Stop laughing. She's gonna pierce your ear. Force you to wear earrings, so ready? Yeah, I'm ready. I do! Okay, okay, anyway. The medicine is bitter. You don't have to take it. Close my eyes and swallow it. So? All right. All right. My bad. There's more than 2,000 km ahead of us. We are still here. With pierced ears, you'll be considered damaged goods. No winning with you. Let's go! We have girls all along the way. Isn't it the medicine you prescribed for me? It turns out my medicine might be poison! Girls are everywhere. Look at that girl. She's really good. Say hi. Do you need a hair cut? What are you doing here? I was stalking you. No way... How? Where are you going? What? Are you leaving me alone? Come on. You're your own boss! I can't tell you what to do. You're a grown-up! I have a problem to solve. Come with me. Are you running away? Let me know If you change your mind. Hey, stop stalking me. -Is your hair real or fake? -It's real. I'm not too old to change. Still have time to start again. To take an adventure and I'll become a superstar. What are you doing? Pick it up. I'm not as lucky as other girls. My life is tough. I'm not being childish. I'm not talking about Little Turtle. My great grandmother died when I was two. My life could easily be a book. I don't understand... What do you want? I'll go with you. -To where? -Beijing, of course. I'll marry you in Beijing. Are you crazy? What makes you think I'd marry you? Oh, I see. No, no, no. Wait. Wait. Wait! Listen to me first. No, no... When you told me on message, that you loved me, I didn't believe. -You said the cyber world was dangerous... -Put on your clothes! Are you a man or not? I couldn't believe you'd pierce for me. Bleed for me. Nothing I can't do for you! Wait. -Please, think it over. -I already did. -It's not what you think. -It is! -Don't move. -It hurts. -It really hurts. -Listen! This is who I am. You treat me well, I treat you well. You have to promise, I am the only one for the rest of your life. Juan! Juan. I know you're inside. Leave me alone. You killed Little Turtle! I don't wanna see you ever again! It was an accident. I didn't mean it. -Get out! -I'm sorry it was all my fault. Fuck off. I don't want to see you! I've brought your favorite rice noodles. Juan. Whose shoes are these? My uncle's. No, they're not. Are you hiding someone in your bedroom? Open the door. Open the door! Open! Li Maomao! Stop kicking! Juan! I know someone's in your bedroom. Let him out. No one's here! Not your business! Are you a man? Come out! Stop hiding like a coward. Hey, listen up. I don't know she was involved with you. Come out. Let's talk. -We did nothing. -Come out! No! Fine. Hide in there. So... Stay there forever then! -Put down my shoes. -Stay inside! That's it. I'm coming out. Let's talk about it. Put it down. -Now! -Calm down, please. Are you her boyfriend? Yes. No, he is not my boyfriend. Your earrings are identical! Your earrings are identical! So what? You had opportunity. You failed to seize it! It wasn't me! Mom didn't want me to wear earrings. Stop it! Your mom didn't want you to pierce. Your mom didn't want you to have tattoos... Just a few drops of blood freaked you out. Are you a man or not? Hey, that's it. It's clear to me now. Listen. Let me talk to you, bro. Well, I didn't do anything to her. I promise you. You guys sort it out. I love him. My mom didn't want me to wear earrings, you find yourself a new lover? What's wrong with it? He's much better than you. He's a true man! He was willing to bleed for me! Do you have balls? Just like him! What's good of having a lover? What's good of having a soul mate? You have a boyfriend! Why want another lover? Stop talking to her in this way. Are you stupid or what? You caught her with her new lover. You have this, for talking to me? Of course, I will use it... Then use it. Let me teach you how to use it! Hit me! Hit me with it! Take it! Take it! Do it. Grab it with your hands! I just slept with your girlfriend. Why you are such a coward! Such a coward! Sir, don't hit me. It's my fault. Stop! Stop! My fault, okay? No, my fault! I am the lover! Shame the youth is hopelessly cowardly, like me... Uncle. What's happening? Little Turtle's gone.

After my shower, she cooked noodles for me! Not instant noodles! Real noodles! The worst thing is, she peeled an egg! Is she crazy? It's just sex. She makes it feel like "family"! Never sleep with the same woman twice! Look at the stupid hickey! It'll take a few days to disappear... Hello? It's Xiaoyu. Yes. I'm sorry the signal is not good. So? Yes, we're on wheels. Yes. He's eating noodles. You've let it go. It won't kill you to make small talk with her. Make a U-turn. I need to go back. What? I have to go! No more games! -What do you mean "go home"? -No! I want home! What do you mean "home"? Hands off. Listen! Go back! -Turn back! You hear me? -Are you fucking crazy? What are you doing? Turn the car around! You... Turn back! What the hell are you thinking? Are you out of your mind? I'm going home. I'm going home to see my mom, all right? It's just a fucking divorce. Get the fuck over it, all right? I don't want to get over it. What can you do about it? I want to stay in the shadow. Forever! All right? Throw that stupid umbrella, you hear me? -No, I won't. -Drop it! No, I won't. No. Go away! I want to stay at home! Why kidnap me? Why did you get me out? I want to hide in my crib, all right? Drop that stupid umbrella, you hear me? No! I am a loser. I can't hook up with a girl, all right?

We will take care of it. We'll pay for all. Everything! All right? I hope you are not hurt. Save your nonsense! All right? Did you hurt your legs? Fuck. What are you doing? Fuck! It's leaking. The brake is broken. -Do you have a signal? -No. What's wrong? Uncle Geng? I'm off to the airport. The airport is too far. I can tow your car. I'll drive. Okay? The airport is in the opposite direction. You're so intelligent. If you tow my car with your car, like the blind leading the dead. Perfect. -You must have majored in science. -No. What? I'll sit next to you to make it easier for the tow. I want him to sit next to me. You sit in your own car. Why? He looks more normal. All right? Trust me, he's... normal but... Take a good look at him. Turn around and look at him. Look carefully. His right ear. Let me tell you something. He's a fag. That's great. You, get in my car. I haven't finished. Actually... I'm not straight neither. You may be gay, but not a good gay. What the hell is this? "In case of danger, take this product out, face the attacker, spray it. It will protect you from danger." Do you spray everywhere? My first time. You're the first victim. I'm the second victim. Cue ball back there is the first. So for women, all men on the earth are evil. You're not woman-friendly for sure. Yes! Your friend told me about what you are. God damn that cue ball. He's such a gossiper. Why throw away? Be confident. -Guys like you are everywhere. -Everywhere? It means society is not on the right track. Now that we are on this trip. Out of sight, out of mind. It's an escape, not a solution. What did you just read? In case of danger, face it. Hello? You stick your eyes on ass? You idiot! Had you looked back once? I'd got lost! But you keep moving! Bullshit! There was no signal here! I'm genius enough to figure out a way to call you. You idiot! Where are you now? Why didn't you honk? There was no fucking battery. Come back and pick me up! Turn the wheels... -Is it okay? -Okay. Wait. Perfect. Is it okay? Let's go. You're truly something. I had no idea where we lost him. I didn't feel anything. Did you? Perhaps, uphill. Why? The gravity uphill, you know. Are we close? It shouldn't be far after that sign. Oh, no. It's downhill and the brakes are out! -Stop. -How? That's useless. -Stop pressing the gas. -I'm not pressing! Is this okay? It'll be fine. It scared me half to death. That was dangerous. God bless crazy people. Cue ball is lucky. What's happening? What should we do? Don't press the gas. I'm not. What should we do? Don't panic! Hey. What are you doing? Don't do it. It's dangerous. Focus on the road. Be careful. Make sure your belt is on! Be careful! Stop doing this! I'm not gay. Hao Yi! Hao Yi! Hao Yi! Run! Fuck... Are you all right? Are you all right? Are you all right? Are you trying to kill yourself? What did you do to her? Nice temper... -Are you guys all right? -It's not all right. I told you many times. Don't pee and poop! Smell it. Uncivilized, you know? Remember that, puppy. It's not right. If you are not satisfied With your life Without happiness and You don't know why You are not happy Neither do you like here... Hello, Hello, beautiful. Is that a CD you're playing? Of course. The days of cassettes are over. It's Geng Hao, right? Who's Geng Hao? I don't know. It's a song about Erhai Lake. Otherwise I'd never let sappy shit like this to be played here. So you're not a fan. Why don't you sell this CD to me? Sell it? But I'm not selling. It's a gift. Thanks. Record a slogan for me. No, no, no. I'm old school. I should just pay with cash. Keep the change. Thanks. The case? -No case. -Why not? It's among that pile over there. Never found. I will find it. You must be one of those nostalgic chicks. Came to Dali for this? Many people swarm to Mount Tai, just because of a poem? A moment on the top blah blah blah... That's Li Bai. Chicks like you shouldn't read his poetry. Here it is. Got it. This guy looks hilarious. No, no, no. Should I have you pay me something for my loss? "A moment on the top" is not Li Bai's poem. It was Du Fu. Pay. -Like music? -Yes. Who's your favorite? Du Fu. Du Fu. Put it down. Put it down. Give me the gun. It's just a prop. It's real! You goddamn kid! Give it to me. A prop gun is dangerous, too. Musician? A failed musician. Now selling second-hand stereos. Thanks. It's not for you to eat. It's to soothe your swelling. -I... -Quiet! Hello? Can you help me to book a flight to Beijing? First-class? No economy class? You don't have to do this. Thanks. Have something. Good news and bad news. Which do you want to hear first? The bad news first then. Here, there's only one flight to Beijing every week. So, I cannot leave. Good news is the flight is tonight, and only one first-class ticket left, I got it here for you. The film company will pay for it. Tonight? In a place like this, with a crushed van, how can I get to the airport? The cars will be fixed. Excuse me. Is this yellow tricycle working? Yes, with a new battery. Hello, Nana? I need to get to the airport urgently. Meet me there, okay? She's a cool girl. Yes. She's very good. She cares about you so much that she can't wait to get rid of you. Sure. She's been very kind to me. Do you fancy her? What are you talking about? Are you in love? I'm not! Come on. If you're in love, just tell me. I'll give her to you! I'm not. Pity... So just leave. Unless... you want me to stay. No, not at all. I fully respect your decision. With a second thought, I'm thinking perhaps I don't have to go. Come on. You should stick to your decision. Thank you for your unfailing support. That's brotherhood. -It tastes weird. -It's organic. This goes forward. This goes backward. This is the brake. Be careful. -Are you sure this will work? -No problem. Try it. Damn, that's spicy! Honestly, I know you're crazy about her. But watch out. Shiny eyes and long legs. Definitely not the marrying type. This is not what you need. This is my girlfriend. She looks cool. Especially her dreadlocks. See you. See you. Come on. Let's go. I just want to say... What else do you want to say? You have her number. Just stay in touch. Oh, I just want to ask you, what is the brand of your man repellent? Keep it as a gift. Keep it as a gift. Read the instruction carefully. Sure. Face the attacker and spray it. Time to go, man. Your dog is horny. -Goodbye. -Bye-bye. Everything is done, except a carrier for the dog. You can buy one from the store over there. I'll go and get one. Wait here. Next, please. Show me your ID, please. Any luggages to check? -Yes. -Put it on the belt. Wife's missed calls. -Hello? -Hello? I saw you called. Sorry I missed it. What's up? I bought a new cell phone. Change my information, need your ID. Sorry... I'm not in Beijing. So you're traveling. I'm with Hao Yi. Shipping props for a film production. Be honest, I know you're trying to avoid me. I'm really worried about you. Come on. We're adults. We have to learn to face reality, right? See, I'm talking to you now. Good... Don't hate me. I won't. It's over. I'm fine now. I believe even if I see you with that guy, I'll be relaxed about it. If one day you decide to marry him, I wish I can be invited to your wedding. Hello? Hello? Let's not talk about this. Why not? Why can't you tell me? I don't know how to tell that... Actually... Are you getting married? I... You're getting married. You're getting married. Yes. Don't you think it's a tad too soon? Geng Hao... I don't mean to upset you. It's good. I... Actually, last time I... You guys are a good fit. I... I should congratulate you. Really. Geng Hao. Please... Are you all right? I... I am fine. Very good. I... I'm really, really fine. I hope you could... find your love. Geng Hao... Don't say that. Good luck. What you said made me feel... And... I've been thinking that maybe we should get together and talk it out. I just called my mom. She said... She said she was good. She asked me not to worry. Oh, really? Really? That's great. So I don't have to go back. Exactly. You don't have to go back. The girl we just met is good. Exactly. Yes, that girl is great. I think she's a good match for me. She fucking totally fits you. Shiny eyes and long legs. She's perfect! The point is... She likes you! I like her, too. Yes, you do! Then you should go and tell her that. I should go and tell her that. Forget about the flight. Go and find her! Now! -Let's go. -Let's go. -Go! -Let's go. Let's go. This way. This way. Excuse me. Excuse me. Tell her loudly. With flowers. She's there! This boarding pass is still valid if we tape it back together. I swear. I'll get someone in bed tonight. Hi, sweetie. Hi, why did you lie to me? You can't fool me. You have no boyfriend. I saw your information on the dating website. Are you kidding me? I'm sorry. All right? All right. My husband has a colleague, who's really nice. Fly back ASAP. I've got you a date on Monday. You hear me? Call you when I'm back. All right? Stop wasting time! Be proactive. -I tell you... -Gee... I'm really busy. Hanging up. Married women are just impossible. Married women are crazy. It's none of your business. Never be a married woman! Again! Leave me alone. Never ever... I want a big house with a view of the sea! I want a "true man"! Here I am! Keep it slow and nice. Only three or four answers? What the hell with other men? Where is the "true man" and the house? What are you looking for? Could it be this cell phone? Thanks. Can you give it back to me? It rains, snows and hails here, but never "phones". Try this. I made it specially for you. Can't you read? Get up there, and yell out your desires. Then you find your phone. Unbelievable. I won't. No phone here. I want a strong man! I am the man! Hey, that's mine. Call out your desire! Hello, beautiful. Come on. Yell out your desires. I want my phone back. It doesn't count. I want... I want... I want... Louder! I want... You bastards to leave me alone! I want to be single forever! See? I knew you'd enjoy this theme. Thank you for your participation. Can you give my phone back now? But you haven't fully opened up. I want you to yell out your desires, not your aspiration. Now yell it one more time. Give my phone back to me. One... Two... No, no, no. You missed the target again. Now it's my turn. You're no sniper either. We'll see. Tell me, you love me. Bro... Are you kidding me？ Are you a teenager? What? Sit down. You look upset, bro. Tell me, you are wrong. What's wrong? Do you admit you made a mistake? Bro... Please, don't do this to me. I don't think I've done anything wrong! Your mistake is that you abandoned him. Bro... Let's have fun. -Shut up. -Shut up! Come on, bro. You're such an idiot. I think you're just torturing yourself. Stop making a scene. Answer me, now. Stop, will you? I'm here for fun! Not your actress! Or earn more as an actress! You want more money? Enough? Hey, bro. I wouldn't mind giving it a shot. I was an extra. Move away! Gold digger! It was true. Really. Tell me. What do you want? -I'm sorry. -Not that. I made a mistake. I love you. Say it with some heart, okay? I love you. It's not real. It's fake! I love you. I love you. With heart! Make it true! From your heart! I love you. I love you. Come on, bro. I can't act! Bro... Stop messing! I can deal no more! To your health! Bro, I love you to death. I love you to hell. Am I more convincing now? Come on. Alcohol makes you say that. Love is being together in rough times. Come on. Drink this. Let's drink! Cheers. Cheers. Go hell! See? Women are all same. For the sake of money, they say "I love you" to everybody. Turned to another guy for money! I had quit from singing and selling second-hand stereos. And you left me without saying goodbye! Fine. Go. Go! My purse... Calm down! Cops! Put on your shoes. What are you doing here? You left without saying "goodbye". Come on. How did you find me? Must be haunted by a ghost. Are you from a horror film? Isn't it disgusting? Say again？ -You are dirty! -So what? -You're dirty! -The man who took bath water is dirty! Shut up, both of you! Get out of here! Stop. Stop. Stop. Put my purse down! -How dare you? That's violent! -Move away! Great. Fine! Fuck you! Don't touch me. Can't you play by the rules? Do you have problems? We are O-N-S! I knew it. Don't sleep twice with the same woman. The truth is... I came to give this... This is "faith". You told me. I thought... It is important to you. You lost it in the hotel. I lied to you, idiot! Fuck. He got divorced. Very upset. I made this all to cheer him up! And you ruined it! Stop stalking me. Get it? Get out! You hear me? Sorry... She's mentally screwed. What? What's your problem? I knew it. Are you pitying me? Thanks. Geng Hao. I did all this with good intentions. Thank you. Where are you going? Your clothes! Hey. Come back! Come back. You hear me? Stop embarrassing me, you jerk. Go, go, go, go. Put your pants back on! Honey. It's them. What the fuck... Hey, hey, hey. Where's that bitch? Look. I just had a plastic surgery, see how it's fucked! What do you say? I'm sorry. We'll compensate. Twenty grand. Twenty grand? What the fuck... I don't have enough cash. I'll give you all. This is all the money I have. I'm sorry, madame. Now you call me "madame"？ What did you call me before? Love me? Say! Love me or not? Yes, I love you. What the fuck... Love boss's wife? No, no, no. I don't love her. Tell me it was a mistake. Yes, it was a mistake. Say it with heart! From your heart! You were such an excellent director minutes ago. You were superb. I'm so sorry. I was a total idiot. Sorry. I was a total idiot. I was a total idiot. Nice tattoo. Are you mafia? No, no, no. -Did you ask my girl to entertain you? -Yes, yes! It's him! You... Stand up on that. Entertain me. Sing a song for me. "Where's the road?" What the fuck... Man. A duet is better. I'm a better singer. Get up there. Get the luggage ready Get the horse ready We'll set out at sunrise... Louder. We'll rest at sunset... Continue. Stop singing. Stop singing. -Stop singing. -Get back to the stage. You have no idea... What the fuck... Kill him. No need to be angry. -I'll kill him. -Move away. Come on. Come on. -Kill me. -Brother... Come and kill me. Don't move. Stand right there. -Oh, brother... -What now? You want more entertainment? Oh, brother... You like music, don't you? Oh, brother. You're still young. You're still young. If you commit murder, your life is over. Sing a song for me. "I'm a happy lamb", 20 times. -Sing! -I really can't. -Sing it. -I'm a happy lamb... Fuck off. Continue singing. I'm just a lamb... What the fuck... Did I ask you to move? Who said you could move? Did I say that you could move? I didn't move. I'm just a lamb... Louder. -I'm just a lamb... -Sing it louder. What the fuck... -I beg you, brother. -What the fuck? -What the fuck? -I can't, brother. I really can't sing, brother... Are you laughing? I was beaten up by those guys. You were just standing there, laughing. Is that right? Can you try to be normal for once, you jerk? What the hell do you mean by "normal"? They asked me to get up here. So I did. They asked me to sing. So I did. Look at you! Damn it. You've become such a loser! I was a loser in the past, and I am a loser now. I am stupid! I'm not you. You flirt with girls. You're the perfect lover. You use guns. You shot the gun... Who are you, Leon The Professional? I did it for your sake. I almost shot someone. I almost committed murder. You did it for my sake? Or you did it to make me feel like a loser? You were right! I was your shadow. I made you feel bigger. What the fuck are you saying? I am very important. I am so important to you. Who else is there in your life? Is there anybody you love? Or who loves you? I am just a puppy in your eyes. What are you doing? I have a gun, too. Geng Hao. This isn't good for our friendship. I've been a brother to you all these years. How can you treat me like this? Say it one more time. Starting from today, you and I go separate ways. You're a woman. -If you were a man... -Stop your nonsense. What's the issue here? Are you manly enough? Real man doesn't argue with girls. How embarrassing! I am a man. The injured party. And you? You killed his phone. Funny? If it's your own phone, I can't say no. If it's someone else's phone, I must say "no". In the future, it doesn't matter whose phone it is. Just don't toss it in Erhai Lake. No good for the environment! I promise it won't happen. I've had enough of this place. Wife Delete Wife Kang Xiaoyu: I am sorry. Geng Hao City of destination, Sir? Dali. You hear me? City of departure? Dali. How many times do you need me to repeat? Airport, please. Hurry. I need a taxi tomorrow morning to the airport. Bye! Kang XiaoYu: I am sorry. Geng Hao Excuse me. Where's my dog? You love him, huh? He's inside. Is this your dog? So... It is yours? -The manager said he was homeless. -Cover his ears before saying that! But you abandoned him. Tell me, what's his name? Geng Hao. That's disrespectful. I know you. Did we meet somewhere before? Your crappy songs... They were all filled with lies. I see. You don't trust men. Fine. I'm sorry. Let me buy you a drink. I don't drink. A glass of water, please. Why are you laughing? The question is, why are you laughing? I'm laughing because you are laughing. Thanks. So weird, this... I hate oranges. But love the smell of orange peel. That's a waste. It tastes like orange. Excuse me. I made a new wall for my customers to write on. Would you like to write on it? Sure. Geng Hao. Kang Xiaoyu. Almost forgot. I'm sorry? Are you saying "sorry"? Don't take it wrong. "Sorry" is the dog's name. What kind of name is that? When you bring him out, you're apologizing to the whole world. Originally I wanted to name him... "Orange Peel". "Orange Peel"? That's not nutritious. How about "Orange Juice"? That's too complicated. So "Juice"? Kang XiaoYu: I am sorry. Geng Hao You want O-N-S? I want... You want muscle? I want... Come on! Or tender tongue? I want... I want O-N-S! You want O-N-S? I want... You want muscle? I want... Or tender tongue? What are you grumbling? We know each other so well, but you are still so hard to read... Better send me a message. Excuse me. Did you get a consent from that lady? Are you a law enforcement officer? No. I'm just asking. Do you know her? Yes. Here in Dali, you get all kinds of girls. We have a party starting from 8:00 PM here. You are invited. Many girls are waiting for you. She's my ex. That woman. "I want...I want...I want..."? No, no, no. He didn't mean it. Just a game. "Montage"! How about stop playing it? Or... delete it. Let me help you with your memory. Bro... he just said, she was your ex. So it means it has nothing to do with you. Nothing. Nothing. Come on. Try... What a fool. I want... A big fool. My ex-wife was in someone's bed. What would I do. Nothing? Excuse me, guys. You said it was none of my business. Let me show you. Look... this iPad, then when the sun reflects upon it, this side is bright, and this side is dark. As dark as it is, it's still part of the iPad. As I was saying... Yes, my failed marriage, it became the dark side. Right? But it's also part of my life. If you insulted my ex, you insult my life. So it is my business. Yes... He is right... It makes no fucking sense. What the hell do you want? I just want to say... Fuck! You! -What do you want? -Wait. Wait. Look. I have a small surprise. It says on the label... It says, whatever you encounter, you must face it. Awake? Stay with me, I'll get you to hospital. You'll be fine. Stay with me! Hold me... Geng Hao! Geng Hao! Help! Help! Help! Anybody? Help! Hey, you! Help! Call 911. Someone is injured. Get help! You know what I'm saying? -Not really. -Help! Call 911. Hao Yi. I want to say... I want to tell you... Say it. I love you. I love you, too. Get up. Let's go. Hao Yi. What I'm saying is... I... love... you. What do you mean? I have never told you this before... Never to... I'm afraid if I don't say now then I won't be able to anymore. Do you love me? Do you? I do, I love you, too. You said you love me! Liar! Where are we going? Tian Men Mountain. Are you crazy? No. It's not your business. I have work to do. The wedding planner is insane because he's a film director, he made my wedding a film's release! I wanted a white wedding. Instead it becomes "Emperor and Assassin"! And... "A Terracotta Warrior"! Mr. Director, the floor is yours! Hello, everybody. My name is Yue Xiaojun. -I'm not late. -Oh, my God. Good to have you here. This is Dong's best friend, Xiao Bei. Say "hi". -Hi. Geng Hao. -Xiao Bei. Now, Hao Yi's best friend, Geng Hao, please give us a speech. At Hao Yi's wedding, I feel happy for him. I want to thank him, for pulling me out from the "shadow" with his best. And courageously entering the shade of his marriage. Now I'm standing in the sun. Now we cheer for this new couple, to give them wishes. Bless him! -How are you? -Good. You look good. You look good, too. What are you laughing about? I just find it funny. The wedding was very funny. The director is crazy. I'll walk you out. Let's go. Don't forget your purse again. I heard you're writing new songs? Yes, I'm trying. Why did you give it up before? Why? Before I had to make a living. I had to make money. Make a living. Life is more than just "making a living". Bye. Eat more. You're too thin. Did you see Hao Yi and Dong Dong? Not in the hall? No. I was told they came out to the parking lot. Let me help you, let me help you, -No, thanks. -Come on. -I'll walk you to the van. -Thanks. This is heavy. Don't let it stain your suit. No worries. I don't need this suit. Really? You looked great in that dress. Thanks. I'm not comfortable in dresses. Really? What's wrong with the car? That's too quick... But legally... No worries. Let's take the stuff to the van. What do you do? Used to sell second-hand stereos. Now, I'm a musician. Cool! I'm teaching music! Really? You have to teach me! Come on. I'd like to hear your work. Maybe I should learn from you. I'm doing it for fun... I have a few demos... Are you free today? I'd like to show you. Yes! I've got some in my phone. Just please don't laugh at me. Too tired... The guests should be leaving. Shall we go and say goodbye? Well... I need to wash off. No! I want Avatar. Come on, take a break. We've been here for too long. I'm spent! Geng Hao blesses Kang Xiaoyu 2014
