You're going to die one day. Stand clear. I know that's kind of obvious, but I just wanted to remind you, - in case you forgot. - Push to shock. You and everyone you know are going to be dead soon. And if you go around giving a fuck about everything and everyone without conscious thought or choice, well, then you're gonna get fucked. Everyone in their Instagram post wants you to believe that the key to a good life is a nicer job, or faster car, a prettier girlfriend, or a selfie at the beach. The message is that a better life is about more, more, more. Buy more, own more, make more, fuck more, be more. To give a fuck about everything all the time. Give a fuck about your new TV. Give a fuck about low-fat milk. Give a fuck about 5G and the G8. Traffic on the 405 and the balance in your 401K. Give a fuck about your SPF and the ozone, the EMI and your BMI. Avoid gluten, but don't piss off Putin. Maximize EPS, but don't mess with the IRS. Is this brand the best? Is it GMO? Fairtrade? Who's the CEO? Should we picket? Is this a riot or a fucking parade? This is me... Mark Manson. And I wrote a book. It had "fuck" on the cover. It's about the sufferings of my not particularly exceptional life. Shitty teenage years, getting dumped, friends dying, a culture that sucked me into a drain hole of my own pain and entitlement, and ultimately, the "fuck you" spiritual advice I used to drag myself out. And by some weird twist of fate, people actually read it. And now a studio is paying I don't know how much money to put me in a freezing pool while girls kick water in my face. It'd be a hell of a lot easier if I could just hit you with seven pithy rules or six easy steps to life success. Yada, yada, yada. But to really get into this stuff, you've got to feel it. And to feel it, well, I guess I'm gonna have to dig up some old painful shit. So, fuck it. Here it goes. Oh, my God! It's full on. Double rainbow all the way across the sky. Oh! Oh, God. So, I grew up just outside of Austin, Texas. And I had a very happy childhood. Up until I was probably, like, ten or 11 years old. And around that time, my family life kind of started coming apart and I got very rebellious. It was Texas. It was horses and Bibles and football. And I wasn't really into any of those things. So, I wore Marilyn Manson T-shirts and listened to heavy metal and smoked pot and... mouthed off to adults. And that was me, you know. That was... That was the little shithead Mark. So, it's February 1998. I'm in eighth grade, and there's a knock on the classroom door. And I look over and it's Mr. Price, the vice principal. I remember he poked his head in and he was like, "Excuse me. Sorry for interruption. Mr. Manson, please come with me." So, I stepped out of class with him, and I thought, "This is weird. Like... Like, usually I go to him. He doesn't come to me." And so I get out in the hall with him and he's like, "Take me to your locker." And I'm starting to freak out. I'm like, "This is not normal. This is not how things usually go." Which one are we talking about? What locker? S-27. We opened my locker, and he just clears the whole thing out. See now, I was a middle-school kid. So I had, like, all sorts of, like, pencils and drawings and notes from girls in class and stuff, you know. He just, like, dumps all my shit on the floor, it just, like, sprays everywhere, and starts rummaging through it. And I'm like, "Damn! This is serious." And as he's digging through all my crap, there's, like, a very awkward silence. He looks at me and he's like, "Do you know what I'm looking for today?" And so I just play stupid. I'm like, "What?" And he's like, "Drugs. Do you have any drugs today?" And in my little, like, pipsqueak voice, I'm like, "No, no. No. No drugs. I-I don't know what you're talking about." And, uh, I can tell he's about to let me go, but he's kind of looking down on the ground at all this stuff, and I don't remember if he... if it was an accident or if he was, like, stepping on the backpack on purpose, but he steps on my backpack, and he feels something's still in it. And he's like, "What is that?" And I was like, "What is what?" And the truth was that I had cut a hole in the backpack, between the pockets, and stuck the drugs in there and then kind of sewn the bottom shut, but it was kind of... it was so you could kind of easily get it open. And he found that hole and he found the drugs, and he ripped it out, and he threw 'em on the desk. I don't remember what he said, but I remember the look, and it had the look of, "You're fucked." The next thing I remember, basically, is being handcuffed, handcuffed and escorted out of the school. And I remember the cop, he's like, "How old are you?" And I said, "Thirteen." And he was like, "What on earth made you do this?" As we're walking out, this girl, her name was Becca, this girl's coming in, this, like, really cute girl I used to flirt with. And she sees me, and she's like, "Oh, hey, Mark." And, like, smiles. And I'm like, "Hi." And then she goes, "Hi, Mr. Price." And then she looks over at the cop, then she looks back at me, and she's like... And, like, completely, like, loses it and, like, runs down the hall. In all the rebellious stuff I did, it always felt like I had an exit. You know, it's like, "Oh, if shit gets too serious, I can always just, like, drop everything and go back to normal." And that was the first time that I was, like, "Wow. Things are never going to be normal again after this." I got thrown in, like, a juvie jail for the day. And I sat there all day waiting for my parents to show up. Yeah. I just remember my mom coming in, tears streaming down her face, and something fundamentally changed. My whole, you know, the false confidence, the bravado of a shithead 13-year-old, like, it all just deflated. I just felt empty. I felt like a little boy. Just totally helpless. And I was. I think we live in a culture today of what I would describe as "delusional positivity." It's been very fashionable, especially in the self-help industry, but in the wider culture at large, to simply believe things you want to believe because they feel good. And we're encouraged to do this at every turn, whether it's, you know, beer commercials or some guru standing on-stage, telling you that you can achieve all your dreams, yada, yada, yada. I find this attitude to be very dangerous and damaging, because the fact of the matter is is that life is always going to suck a little bit. And it turns out, the more we learn and understand about our psychology, the more it turns out that our brain is kind of playing this game with us. Generally speaking, things in the material world work very algorithmically. You know, it's like if you want X result, you need to do A, B and C to get there. It's like a Lego set, like, you find the steps, and then you follow the steps, and the thing happens. Where that breaks down and stops working is in the experiences of our own mind. So, take happiness, for example. There's no formula for happiness. There's no X, Y, Z. "Do these things every day for three weeks and you'll be happy." Right? Like, it doesn't work that way. Happiness is not algorithmic. It's not a solvable equation. But our mind plays this game with us. Our mind tells us that as soon as you get X, everything is gonna be great. Or as soon as you get rid of Y, everything is gonna be fine. And we believe it. And it's not true. You know, it's like there's always this little carrot dangling in front of us. Man, I just... if I can just get a raise at work then, like, things are gonna be fine, you know. And then you get the raise at work and it's, like, all these new responsibilities happen. People are reporting to you, you're having to work on weekends. You're like, "Shit. If I could just get more vacation time, then everything will be great." Then you get more vacation time, and it turns out that, well, damn, there are a lot of places to go on vacation, and you're dissatisfied with pretty much any place you pick, because the one on Instagram looked better. You're like, "Shit. I need to go on vacation to the one on Instagram." And then you go there and it turns out the weather is bad. And so there's just, like, there's shit wherever you go. There's always a problem. There's always dissatisfaction. Yet our mind keeps playing this game with us. It keeps dangling the reward in front of us, convincing us that if we can just take that next step, then we'll live happily ever after. Psychologists call this the hedonic treadmill. It's this idea that we keep running to accomplish something that's gonna make us feel better. But the fact of the matter is we're spending all this energy yet getting nowhere. So, this idea that we're gonna somehow find some magical solution to dissolve our suffering, to dissolve our dissatisfaction permanently, it's just bullshit. Happiness is great, but it's kind of blah, because when you're happy, it means nothing needs to change. And so I think it's important to learn how to sit with your negative emotions, because it's like cross-training for your mind. You're always... everything you try to do in your life, you're gonna bump up against challenges, setbacks. People are gonna do awful things to you, accidents are gonna happen, and so the more you're willing to sit with those feelings, the more prepared you're gonna be in the moment, when something goes wrong. And this is why I always say that happiness does not come from getting rid of your problems. Happiness comes from solving your problems. If at any point you believe you don't have any problems, if you're ignoring your problems or avoiding them or escaping them in some way, you're likely harming yourself over the long run. And this is why negative emotions are more interesting and useful than positive emotions. Because you can't always trust your positive emotions. I remember they got me out of the jail and there was a McDonald's across the street, and we went and sat in that McDonald's for three or four hours, and they made me tell them everything. They told me I was never gonna see any of my friends again. They told me I was never gonna go back to that school again. Essentially, I mean, for a 13-year-old, that's basically like telling you your life's over. So, I lost my friends, lost my school, lost my legal rights. And then three months later, my parents got divorced. And so my family fell apart. And so in the span of about six months, everything I understood about my life and who I was collapsed at roughly the same time. Like, just everything went to shit at the same time. From that point, you know, there was a deep, deep sense of hurt. I went to basically being a lonely kid with no friends, no family. A lot of the other guys start picking on me, you know, beating me up. And I spent the vast majority of my time getting high, playing video games, playing music, basically being on my own. People would come over and just... sit with me and talk, like, it was like I wasn't there, you know. It was like there was this... meat robot that was, like, pretending to be Mark, but Mark was somewhere else. I had a lot of social anxiety. I used to think to myself, "Man, I wish I knew how to talk to people." I had so many completely irrational beliefs about how the world worked. I had trouble believing and trusting that people actually liked me or were interested in hanging out with me. But because I was unaware that I had created this prison for myself, I just felt very helpless. I became this, like, very insecure, kind of... strangely meek guy... with a sense that something is fundamentally wrong with me... but that I'm somehow at the center of the universe. I once knew this guy named Jimmy. Jimmy was a real go-getter. Here we are. Welcome home, baby. He seemed to always know these incredible people in powerful places, you know. He always had business ventures going, trying to find some new angle. Always onto the latest new thing. He was a super-positive guy, a lot of fun to be around. Great dude to party with. Mmm. She's tasty to arrive in. Like the guy was just always on. I want you to remember this moment. Don't forget this fucking moment. He seemed to completely lack the insecurities that I had so much of. And for a while, that was an incredibly empowering thing to be around. He and I had a lot of fun. The problem was is that he was a total fraud. Like, just... full stop, hundred percent fraud, top to bottom. He would do things like talk companies into bringing him on as an angel investor, you know, and giving him advisor equity because of all these other start-ups he had supposedly worked for. But he hadn't actually worked for any of those start-ups, and he didn't actually have any expertise. He just talked his way into it. Next thing you know, these people have given a percentage of their business to this guy. He never shows up for work and he never does anything. There was always some great business idea that was gonna take off. It was gonna be the next Uber, or the next Facebook, whatever. And no, he was just, you know, picking up some girl, and taking her to some restaurant, and spending $1,000 on dinner. So, the question is, is Jimmy a successful guy? Is he happy? On paper, he's everything that we consider successful. But on a moral metric, he's a disaster. So, how did this happen? You know, back in the 1970s, self-esteem kind of became all the rage in psychology. There were a number of studies that were done in the '60s that found that generally, kids who felt better about themselves got better grades in school, got better jobs after school, made more money, committed less crime. Self-esteem kind of... it became celebrated as this panacea for all the social ills. Like, we just need people to feel good about themselves. And then everything else will take care of itself. And so this is when you start getting grade inflation in schools, you start getting participation trophies in sports, you start getting parents telling their little Timmy and little Susie that, "You can be whatever you want to be. You're brilliant as you are. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise." And a whole of generation of teachers and parents and leaders did this, believing that they were raising kind of this psychologically elite generation of people who were gonna feel great, and do amazing things in the world. But then you jump 20 years later, and the data came in. And it turns out that raising people's self-esteem, it doesn't create a generation of Bill Gateses and Martin Luther King Juniors. It creates a generation of Jimmys. Jimmy was always positive. Jimmy always felt great about himself. Jimmy always thought he deserved whatever he got. And that's insane. That's... Society cannot function if everybody is like that, if everybody believes they have a right to take more than they give. Jimmy is entitled. And entitlement, it's when you feel as though you deserve the benefits of something without giving up the cost of something. When you feel like you should have the results without having the sacrifice. You know, Jimmy's problem was that he thought he should be a total bad-ass and a huge success, without actually putting the work in, without actually doing anything. Fundamentally, entitlement is a way to protect ourselves. It's a delusional belief to remove you from the reality of yourself; the reality that life is fucking painful, you're limited, and no matter what you do, it's always gonna be that way. And so when that is too painful for us to accept, we create these delusional beliefs that somehow we're special, we're unique, we deserve special treatment. That our problems are problems that nobody else can understand. That our talents are talents that nobody else can understand. That it's the world that's holding us back. That we would be great and everything would be perfect if it wasn't for that guy or that group or that situation. It's a protective layer for ourselves because it prevents us from returning to that point of that intense pain. It's like a circuit breaker goes off in our brain and we almost, like, we have to escape it, you know. We have to find an exit route. You know, I didn't... I never knew Jimmy well enough to figure out what had gone on in his life to make him that way. But, like, you're talking about a guy... He didn't seem to even understand the notion of friendship or trust. Like, trust to him, like, seemed like a... like a way to get fucked over, you know. And so, it just makes you wonder, like, what in his background hurt him so badly to make him protect himself? But, like, to me, it was incredibly validating to have somebody like that, you know. I can be that guy who's saying whatever the fuck he wants, I'm that guy who can walk up to any girl he wants. Like, just completely shattered everything I knew about life in reality. Entitlement is... it's easy to fall into because it feels good. It's satisfying, in a weird sort of way. You know, like, we all... we like the idea that we're somehow the exception in the world, you know. Like, we like the idea that our problems are somehow unique or insurmountable, because it... it suggests that there's something... uniquely meaningful about our own existence. We're constantly allured by this message that we are somehow deserving of everything that we desire. There's not a conspiracy theory, it's not a nefarious plan. It's just, I think, when that happens to be what wins people's attention, and you've built an economy off of monetizing people's attention, you end up with a culture that is largely built on the message of entitlement. Traditional self-help says that every single person is special and unique and can be extraordinary. I find that tyrannical, like, I find that to be a very confining idea, because it promotes entitlement in people. I think what's actually very liberating is recognizing that none of us are very special. We're all very mundane, we all deal with the same problems, we all suffer in very similar ways to each other. But the problem is that with social media and the internet, we are constantly exposed to the top 0.0001 percent of performers in everything. And we are good to go. If you think about most of our existence online and what we're exposed to, I mean, it's... You go on Instagram and you're just greeted by ridiculously good-looking people in ridiculously good-looking locations doing ridiculously awesome things... pretty much 24/7. And you go on Twitter and it seems like the fucking apocalypse has just started. And then you go on Facebook and seemingly every single person is either getting married or having a kid at the exact same time. This is the human highlight reel of social media. Yes! Meanwhile, you're sitting in your fucking living room, hand in your underwear, wondering what the fuck went wrong. How did this happen? Why is my life so fucking mundane? And it's like... you feel like a loser. But there's no reason to, because that's what everybody's life looks like. We're all sitting in our living room with our hand in our underwear, scrolling the exact same shit on our phones. It's just, like, this is not reality. There's all of these narratives out there that... that kind of convince us that, "Hey, you deserve to be this special guy or girl, and if you can just embody that life, you'll be problem free. You won't have to deal with pain again. You won't have to sacrifice or struggle." And that's bullshit. Look, the reason this message, like, "Life fucking sucks, you're always gonna have to sacrifice, always gonna struggle, always gonna have problems." The reason you don't hear this more is because it doesn't sell. You can't sell a car by telling people, like, "Hey, buy this car. You're still gonna be miserable, even though you bought it." Like, that doesn't move merchandise, that doesn't help the bottom line. And I don't think the problem is necessarily with, you know, capitalism or the system or whatever, the problem is with us. Like, we just don't understand how our own minds work. And so we've got to get straight with ourselves. I think there's an undue psychological pressure to feel as though we're extraordinary in some way, that we're doing something extraordinary. And I think this pushes a sense of entitlement, it pushes a sense of, "Well, I deserve to have these things. I deserve to be happy. I'm great at something. People should know that." I think if there was just a simple cultural acknowledgement of, like, "Yeah. Most of us suck at most of the things we do, and that's fine," we could escape these things. But in my case, I covered up my baggage and my insecurities with a sense of entitlement. And, you know, because so much of my pain revolved around intimacy and relationships and trust, I just became kind of an entitled... asshole with a lot of relationships in my life. From that pain, and from that place of just not knowing what the hell to believe, not being able to trust anybody, I was, like, "Well, fuck it. I'm gonna get what I want." I just went into full over-compensation. I was kind of your classic, like, selfish player. You know, I cheated on girlfriends, I... I was always the guy who would just disappear. My twenties is just like a fucking battlefield... with, like, bomb craters where my relationships used to be. It's just like strewn corpses of old friendships and romantic partners... that I just completely decimated... mostly due to my own entitlement. I remember one time, in college, I kind of stole my buddy's girl. I was at a mutual friend's place, and I was sitting on the couch with her, holding hands, and he walked in the room, he took one look at me and her, and immediately turned around and walked out of the house, and he never spoke to me again. And I just remember being like, wow. Like, this dude just, like, he's just jealous, you know, that I can get his girl, and he can't get her back or whatever. Like, I... to me it was... I couldn't see it through, like, a normal human's eyes. I can only see it through, like, my kind of obsessive, entitled eyes. I basically have this, like... four-year period in my life, where I have no friends from that period. I have friends from before that period. I have friends from after that period. But there's four or five years there where none of those people talk to me anymore. So, I'm a huge metal fan. One of the interesting things about heavy metal is that arguably the two greatest bands were originally one band. you want to say to everybody out there? Metal up your ass! Dave Mustaine was the original lead guitarist of Metallica. And he wrote a lot of the songs on Metallica's first and second records. The problem was that both Dave Mustaine and James Hetfield, who was the lead singer and songwriter of Metallica, they're both rebellious kids. And so they would both get drunk and just beat the shit out of each other. And so in the midst of recording Metallica's first album, Metallica just decided, "You know what? Let's get rid of Dave Mustaine." So, they woke him up one day by just handing him a bus ticket. And so mid-album, like, the day before they're gonna start recording, Dave wakes up with a hangover, and they just hand him a bus ticket and say, like, "Get the fuck out." That's how he found out he was out of the band. And so he rode this, like, three-day bus back to L.A. And on the bus, you know, this fire started to build up inside him. And by the time he got back to California, he had decided, "You know what? I'm gonna start a new metal band. It's gonna be a better metal band, and it's gonna fucking kick Metallica's ass." And so sure enough, he got back, he found better musicians, he started writing better songs, found better producers to record with, and he produced what became known as Megadeth. You guys ready for Megadeth? Now, Megadeth went on to sell millions of albums. They've toured the world dozens of times. They've played in stadiums. They're one of the biggest rock arena acts there's ever been, yet... The band he got kicked out of was Metallica, an even bigger rock band that sold even more albums, and played in even more stadiums, and was even more famous. And so, this put Mustaine in a really bizarre situation, where he had achieved unimaginable success by almost any stretch of the imagination. But, like, the defining value that was kind of steering his career, which was to be better than Metallica, was never achieved. He was giving a fuck about the wrong thing. He was so focused on one-upping these other guys who had insulted him, who had hurt him, that he missed all the amazing things that went on at the same time. It puts a person like him in a situation where he can sell 20 million albums, and play to 100,000 people, and feel like a failure, whereas any other rational person would feel like a great success. My first girlfriend I ever had, we were doing long-distance, doing the phone thing, seeing each other, like, every few months or whatever. It sucked. But, you know, we were madly in love and when you're that age, you think love conquers everything. You're, like, "It's gonna be all right. We're gonna make it." And we did this for... quite a while. And suddenly one week, she's not... she's not around. You know, she's giving excuses and... She's always got... Something's always come up. She's not answering her phone, which never happened before. So it started to feel really weird and I would try to confront her about it and she'd kind of blow me off or, you know, make a big thing out of it, so I didn't know what was going on. And then one day, I just get a phone call from a number I don't recognize, and I pick up the phone and it's this guy... I can't remember his name. It's Derek or Eric or something. Anyway, he's like, "Hey, man, we don't know each other, but I know your girlfriend, and we need to talk." I'm like, "OK." He's like, "She's been cheating on you." And I was like, "OK." Obviously I'm skeptical at first, and so I'm like, "How do you know?" "Well, I know because she was cheating on you with me first and now she's cheating on you with another guy." I'm like, "What the fuck?" He's like, "Don't worry. I'm gonna prove it to you." And so this guy, he's in front of her house with the phone, knocks on her door and he's holding the phone by his side with me on it. He knocks on the door, and she comes to the door and he confronts her. He's like, "What the hell are you doing with this guy here? I thought you were with me," or whatever, and they start arguing. She's like, "I'm not with you anymore, I'm with him." And then he's like, "What about your boyfriend, Mark?" And she's like, "Oh, you don't know anything about him. It's none of your business," blah, blah, blah. And then he pulls out the phone and he's like, "Mark's right here." And she's like, "No, he's not." And then, like, he makes her take the phone, and then I'm like, "What the fuck is wrong with you?" So she and I are screaming at each other and all this stuff, and then she dumps me right there on the spot. I laid on my bed crying and I think I was just in shock. Obviously I was crying for her, but I was grieving just this loss of this naive view of the world, that if you were in love, everything was going to be OK. All of that just got smashed in that moment. I thought I had a really great relationship with my girlfriend and so the fact that this could happen, was, like, just too much. It was, like, caving in on me. I don't think I told anybody how angry I was. I didn't know how to express it without, like, losing myself. You know, you start developing these beliefs of, like, "I'm fine. She was just a horrible person, and I didn't deserve this." And there's this perverse kind of certainly that emerges. You know, each failed relationship I had, I just used that as further evidence of, "Ah, well. This is just... this is just how things are. People are shitty. Nothing... Love never works out, you know." It was... That's how I saw things. You know, it's the classic victimhood entitlement. What happened with Dave Mustaine is a great example of how we all react to extremely painful situations. You know, the pain of getting kicked out of his first band, and feeling like... like he wasn't worthy of them, it forced him to construct this world view. This world view of, "I'm gonna be better than them. Everything I do has to be better that Metallica." And we all do this in one way or another. We suffer a great amount of pain, we create a world view to help us escape that pain, and then we forget that we created the world view, and so we're doomed to repeat a lot of our failures. In the closing months of 1944, after almost a decade of war, the tide was turning against Japan. Defeat seemed inevitable. The Americans arrived with overwhelming force. Second Lieutenant Hiroo Onoda of the Japanese Imperial Army was deployed to Lubang with near impossible task of defending the island. Just 22 years old, Onoda had trained with the elite Futamata Commando Unit. He was given the express instructions to halt the enemy advance, to never surrender, and under no circumstances take his own life. Within days, most of the Japanese soldiers had either been killed or taken prisoner. But Onoda, his burly sergeant, and two young privates evaded capture, and stole away into the mountains. From there, they launched a guerrilla campaign attacking supply lines... stealing food, - and harassing stray patrols. - Incoming! August the 6th, the first atomic bomb hit Hiroshima. The representatives of the Emperor of Japan... Half a year later, Japan surrendered, and the deadliest war in human history came to its dramatic conclusion. The US Military dropped leaflets announcing that the war was over, and that it was time for the Japanese soldiers to go home. Onoda read these leaflets, but he was convinced they were fake, a trap set by the Americans to flush them out. The Philippine locals, sick of being terrorized, armed themselves. Local police patrols are stepped up and in a bloody skirmish, Onoda's sergeant is shot and killed. Onoda and his last remaining companion vow to avenge the death of their friend. The attacks escalate, and for the Japanese government, the exploits of the fugitive lieutenant were kind of becoming a diplomatic crisis. A massive recovery operation is funded. Letters and pictures from the missing soldiers' families were scattered across the island, along with a letter from the Emperor himself, imploring the two men to give themselves up. But once again, Onoda refused to believe the information was real. Once again, he believed it was all a trick by the Americans. Once again, he stood his ground, and continued to fight. In a desperate last-ditch effort, Onoda's brother is flown from Japan, and escorted into the mountains. Onoda watches as his brother calls out his childhood nickname and sings their old school song. Could he have been wrong for the last 15 years? Could his comrades have died for nothing? Could the Filipinos that he killed have been innocent? It's too painful to consider. Onoda dismissed his brother as a convincing fake sent by the enemy to confuse him. A decade later, a shootout with local police. Kozuka is killed. Onoda, having spent half his life waging an imaginary war in the jungles of Lubang, was now alone. So, the only real job I've ever had is, um... I got a job at this bank and it was absolutely soul-destroying. We were going around one afternoon and people were saying, "What are you..." People were asking each other, "What are you gonna do once you start making six figures?" And everybody was like, "I'm gonna buy a BMW," or, "I'm gonna get a boat on the lake, and I'm gonna take it out in the summer," and all this stuff. And then it got to me and I was like, "Well, I think I'd take a year-long sabbatical and travel around the world." And they're, you know, it was like... crickets. You know, like everybody was just looking at me like... "What's wrong with you, man?" And it was at that moment that I kind of realized, like, I shouldn't be here. And so, in 2009, I set off to live around the world. I did want to see the world and understand different cultures, and meet different types of people, but there was also... kind of this compulsive avoidance of commitment.
