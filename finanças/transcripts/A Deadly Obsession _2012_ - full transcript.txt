My dad came home once, drunk... ...and told my mom that he had been fired, like it was a joke. But that was just kind of the way my dad was, you know, it wasn't really his fault, really. Go on. She started screaming at him. Telling him that he wasn't a real man, and that she couldn't be the only breadwinner. And then she kicked him out. Kind of like she'd been looking for a reason to kick him out, actually. How'd your father react? He said that he was taking me with him. That he wasn't going to let me turn out like her. So he came in my room, and he was bending over... ...uh, when she did it. - When she shot him. - Yes. In the head, with a gun that he used to keep in his bedside drawer. And you were how old? Six. I was six. Have you ever gone to visit your mother? No. ♪ I really don't mind ♪ Walking in the rain ♪ But if you hold my hands up close ♪ ♪ You'll see a different shade of pain ♪ ♪ And I really don't mind ♪ And I really don't give a... ♪ ♪ Put your head upon my shoulder ♪ ♪ Look ahead and take your feet up off the ground ♪ ♪ And I really don't mind ♪ And I really don't give a... ♪ ♪ Your head upon my shoulder ♪ Look ahead take your feet up off the ground ♪ Remember our first run up here? Of course. It was right after your first deployment. Yeah. Uh... Uh, Suzanne... You are, uh... You are so beautiful, and... ...and strong, and you're smart, and... ...no one knows me as well as you know me, and... Baby, this is really sweet, but you're making me really nervous. Uh... Will you marry me? I don't know what to say. "Yes" would be a really good thing to say... right now. I can't. I'm sorry, will you just... Will you stand up please? I just wasn't expecting this. I... Baby, I love you. I just have some things that I need to work out before I can commit, you know? No, I... I'm committed, I'm committed, I just... before I can commit to this. Yeah. All right. Logan, will you just... um... What do you think's gonna happen, Suzanne? I mean, what are you afraid of? You know what I'm afraid of! I just... I'm just not ready. I can't, I can't. OK. Just take this, OK? - I don't... - Just hold onto it, OK? Just hang on to this. And you can wear it when you're ready. OK? Hey, Jamie, wait up! Oh, I think things may have changed since I got engaged, in about, oh, 10 BC, but I thought that the engagement ring was supposed to go on the finger. He says that I need to face my fears. Ah, well, he's right. That's easier said than done when what you fear lives inside of you. Mmm... One could argue that the object of everyone's fear lives inside them. No thank you. So, is that my object of fear? This? No, no, no. No, this... is a test. And what's important are not the results. What's important is what you do with the results. Suzanne, what's ever inside this envelope... ...shouldn't keep you from living your life. Who would want to marry someone with a predisposition for murder? Well, apparently, Logan would. That's because he doesn't understand. So... I see, what this is, is maybe the world's most intellectually rigorous case of cold feet. I'm sure that it is. I wonder if we can test for it empirically? All right. Suzanne, come on. You have worked so hard. You've helped so many people find their way to happiness. I just want to make sure you find some for yourself. - Yeah, OK. - Oh, wait! Almost forgot to tell you, I need your classroom today, 205, for a final. You're gonna have to move your section to the science library classroom. OK, that's fine. And thank you for this. My pleasure. - Thanks, Julie. - Thanks. Oh, Lieutenant Olsen. Good to see you. The pleasure's all mine, Caroline. Would you like your usual? - Yeah, please. - Of course. Hey, it's Julie, right? - Hey, Kellen. - Hey. Jocks! Uh... Don't you have class in a few minutes? Did you memorize my schedule? No, I just... you know, I don't normally see your pretty face on a Wednesday since you went back to school. Well, you're my last customer, lieutenant. It's... it's Michael. And thank you for, uh... waiting for me. Are you giving me your number, Michael? Uh... Yeah, uh, yeah. I mean, you know, in case you need... assistance some time. - Hey, you OK? - Yeah, I'm fine. Here, get up. Get up. What's your name? Ooh! Aah! Uh, it's Jeremy. Jeremy, are you an idiot? That guy almost hit me! You're riding on the wrong side of the road! Look, I almost just got hit by a car, and you... you're yelling at me? You're texting. - Oh come on, man! - It's lieutenant. Come on, lieutenant... I'm already late to class, now what, are you gonna give me a ticket for texting while cycling? - Jeremy? - Do you know this clown? He's in my criminal brain class. What did he do? He almost got hit by a car. Well, shouldn't you be talking to the driver? Exactly! Think you could just let him off with a warning? Free latte tomorrow? Jeremy... wear a helmet next time. Thank you. That was awesome. Thank you so much. What is it with you teenagers? - Hey, I'm 20. - Whatever. What I mean is, you are so smart in class, and then as soon as you leave, you start acting like total morons. I don't know, maybe it's something to do with that old orbitofrontal cortex? - Is that what it is? - Oh, someone's been doing his homework. - Hot for teacher, huh? - Oh... - How did you know? - Please. - Is it that obvious? - Please! Sorry about the change of venue. I'm glad you all could find us. OK, um... So, last week, we were talking about the orbitofrontal cortex. So who can guess which of these two brains is that of a criminal? - Yes? - The one on the left. - Why? - Well, there's less activity in the orbitofrontal cortex. Which means? The subject is not exhibiting, um, an empathetic response? And why is that significant? - Kellen? - Um... I think... I think she pretty much got it. So maybe a little more note-taking and less social networking? - Sorry. - OK. Why is that significant? - Julie? - The orbitofrontal cortex is, uh, part of the brain that controls the conscience - and ethical decision-making. - Right. - Oh, OK. - Good. So let's say, for the sake of argument, that I was to commit a violent crime... Neither a PET brain scan nor a genetic test would be conducted to determine how much time I would spend in jail. Instead, there's a chance that I would be given a different sort of evaluation. The Psychopathy Test, or Psychopathic Traits Evaluation. It's a simple list of traits possessed by most psychopaths, scored on a number system. OK, it's a bit controversial, but what's great is that this test is actually considered one of the most important factors in determining whether or not a person has psychopathy, and its results have a lot of weight with parole boards. Hannah, are you going back to the dorm? So a score of 30 or more can mean the difference between a few years or life in prison. So let's go around the table, and we'll just start at the top, and we'll go through the list. - Caroline. - "Inflated ego." "Mythomania or compulsive lying." "Little or no compassion or guilt." Hey! "Unrealistic goal setting." - What's up? - Number five. Yeah, what's up? Oh! Um... "Poor social interactions or controls." Pop! "Shallow emotional responsiveness." "Childhood behavioral difficulties." - "Inability..." - "Inability to accept fault or blame." OK. What? Why is everyone looking at me? Whoa, what was that?! - What is that? - That was a gun. Oh, no! Calm down. - Is that what I think it is? - That was a gun. Oh, no. Professor Hollander! We need to block the door and prevent anyone - from getting in. - Get the table. Just move it right up against the door. Please don't shoot. Please don't shoot. Can we talk? What do you want? What do you want? Can you let them go, please? Please let them go? You two, go. Now! Go! Oh, my God! - Thank you. - Where's Suzanne Hollander? And how did that make you feel? Did it make you angry? Yeah, I guess so. Is that why you killed your mother's cat? What? Your mother's cat, that you smothered. Is that why you killed it? I guess so. And what does that mean? - What does what mean? - "I guess so." It would just be helpful for me to understand. Did you kill the cat because you were angry? Did you... did you want revenge? She loved that cat more than she loved me. And what does that mean? What does "love" mean? I don't know. But Connor, you need to understand that love is something that two people feel together. You know, it might be harder for you to fall in love... It's not me that has the hard time falling in love. OK. But it might be harder for you to fall in love until you believe that you are worthy of that love from someone else. Until you choose to open yourself up completely. I mean, love is... Love is hard. And it takes compromise. You will fully understand that someday. - Do you? - I'm sorry, do I what? Do you understand what love is? "Campus on lockdown, gunman on the loose." - I got the same text. - It says there's only one? Uh, it says one gunman, described as dark hair, twenty-something male, thin build, approximately five foot ten. I don't... He's coming! OK, OK, you guys, we need to get to the back of the classroom, and get to a lower level. Go! Get... Jeremy, look, I know how you're feeling, no time to panic... OK. OK. - What... - What happened? - Help me get him up. - Oh, my gosh, what happened? Let's go. Move. Go, go, go! - OK, go! - Go! Keep going! - Hey, Jen, what's the status? - I just spoke to campus police. They've sent a text alert to every student on campus, but they need to go around and make sure that everyone's staying in their dorms. OK, good. How many are still in there? This is every class scheduled to be in the science center when the shooting started. Could be as many as 25 still unaccounted for. Caroline... OK. Go to where they set up triage, find out who from this list is still inside. If there is hostages, we need to find out how many. Go. Wait, Jen. What's the head count? Reports are pretty vague, but we think maybe five are dead, at least another ten injured. Is he just shooting randomly? I mean, what are... what's going on here? It's strange. All the witnesses said it was almost like he was looking for someone. All right, get out of here. Please, just calm down. This is Suzanne Block, reporting on the scene where panic has erupted due to a gunman firing shots on the campus of nearby Gambles College. An unknown number of victims have been injured and local emergency units have rushed to the scene to assess what witnesses have confirmed to be a hostage situation here inside the school. Just go to the back. Keep going. Careful, careful. Go to the back. All the way to the back, come on. - You guys, it's fine. Keep going. - Shh! OK, you guys split up. Go to different sides. Different sides. Stay down, stay down. There, OK. All right. You know... ...I always had a huge crush on you. Never thought you'd actually be taking my shirt off, though. There's no cell service down here. I can't die like this! I've got kids! I need, like, a piece of cloth or something to clot. - Uh, I have a hat. - That'll work. That'll work. Kellen, finger. Put your hand down. How do we know he's not gonna find us down here? Because we blocked the only entrance to the science library, OK? There've got to be other ways in. We are just gonna sit here and wait for the police to get here, all right? You're all right. Come on, doc. I think you do know where Suzanne Hollander is. - I think she's escaped... - No, no one can escape. I've locked us all in. Now, where is she? How long have you had this thing? "Are you all right? There was a shooting at Gambles College." Yadda, yadda, yadda. Yadda, yadda... Suzanne Hollander. "Thanks for our little chat. I'll be happy to use the science library." Thanks, doc. Wait, where are you going? Where are you going?! I think you've got some mommy issues of your own, and that's the reason you became a shrink. I'm not a shrink. I'm a doctor, and I'm in research. Connor, there's a big difference. All right, but that doesn't answer my question. You have mommy issues, don't you? What makes you say that? No pictures of your mom and dad. Why? So, what's your issue with your parents? - What do you want to be when you grow up? - Come on... Don't change the subject. OK, how about this? A little quid pro quo. Do you know what that means? Do you I look stupid to you? No... you do not look stupid. All right, fine, quid pro quo. Tell me something about your mother. OK, I will admit that I have... issues with my parents. I knew it. My issue, Connor, is that I didn't really have them. I grew up in the system. - The system? - Foster care. I bounced around a lot. The longest I ever stayed with a family was one year. Your turn. What do you want to do when you graduate? I want to teach. You want to teach? Do you think that's something you'd be good at? No, no, no, I don't want to be a teacher. They don't teach. They indoctrinate. I want to... I want to really teach people something. You guys, we've got to keep moving, OK? We're like sitting ducks down here. Jeremy's dying over here! Can we give him a minute? Yeah, and I don't want to end up like him! You guys, nobody is dying! Come on! Jeremy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, OK? We're gonna get you out, I promise, but that's not gonna happen if we're just sitting in the boiler room! Do you have a better plan? This is Olsen. Put him through. Yeah, Lieutenant Olsen. Who am I speaking to? All right, I need you to listen very carefully, Lieutenant Olsen. I have hostages. I may or may not kill some of them. But if I see a single cop come in here, I'm killing all of them. - You understand? - Yes, it's clear. Uh, tell me your name. Why should I? So, uh, we can have a civil conversation. I'd like to know who I'm speaking to. I have no interest in having a civil conversation with you. OK, that's fine. That's fine, you have all the power. Just thought maybe we could, you know, come to an understanding or something. I know I have all the power. So if I see a single cop come in here, the blood's on your hands. You understand that? Yes, I understand. Good. Bonnie... Bonnie! I know that this is hard. But you need to be strong and stay calm, OK? All right, one of us needs to go upstairs and see if we can get any cell service. See if we can call for help. - That's a good idea. Right? - Yeah... yeah, I agree. I mean, if you're willing, Kellen... You guys, stop it! Hey... No one is going anywhere, all right? You're my responsibility, I can't allow it. It's too risky, OK? We're just gonna stay here and wait for the police. All right? Jen, who just put that call through? Who was that from? I don't know, dispatch just said it was related to the shooting. - That was the shooter. - You made contact? No, he made contact. He's got hostages. So, what are we going to do? Uh... I don't know, um... All right, we gotta find a place where we can set up shop. You know, somewhere we can get, uh... You know, like a classroom or something, you know. Figure out a plan. We're setting up a triage area and a command center in the cafeteria. OK, good, I'll look at these. And in the meantime, you go to campus security. Get me any footage of any security anywhere on campus. OK? And where's my SWAT team? They say they're still about 45 minutes out. What? Are you kidding me? - Go get 'em now! Go! - Yes, sir. Geez. Damn, we are in the sticks! Hey, you the officer in charge? Uh, yeah. Uh... What, are you FBI? Not exactly. I need to get in here. Uh, sorry, no one gets... Who are you? Gunnery Sergeant Logan Garrison, US Marine Corps. Yeah? Where did you come from? That doesn't matter, I saw this on TV. We have a hostage situation... How many people you still got in there? - Ten, maybe more. - What the hell are you doing? - Where's your SWAT team? You got a negotiator? - They're still 45 minutes out. You don't got 45 minutes! Those people will be dead by then! They're not gonna be... Excuse me, do you mind... Yes, they will be dead by then and you know it! OK, listen... I've done two tours in Afghanistan. OK, I've been through hostage negotiation, I trained special ops. I'm the best option you've got right now. Forget it. Nobody goes in. All right, hey... Do you have someone special in your life? What's that got to do with anything? 'Cause the woman I love is in that building right now. OK, I'm not going to stand by and wait for some nut job to destroy my life. I'm going in there, whether you let me or not. Come on. Try switching spots with me. You're fine. You're fine. You got him? OK. have you always had a thing for psychos? What makes you think I have a thing for psychos? Well, we go overtime every single week. I don't have a thing for psychos. Nor do I have a thing for you. I'm trying to learn about you so I can help you. Which is why I really need you to talk about Thanksgiving. I don't want to talk about that. We need to talk about what happened with your mom. Talk about Thanksgiving in general. Anything that you can remember, want to talk about... Well, from the moment I got off the plane, she set in on me, you know, like the clothes I was wearing, the music I listened to, my grades, everything. - Go on. - Well, Thanksgiving was the same as usual. We went to my aunt's house, the turkey was dry, everyone was sappy about what they were thankful for... And what were you thankful for? Uh... You. Any luck with the cell phones? No, they go right to voice mail. Seems like they don't have any reception. Must be underground, which means they're on the cellar level or in the steam tunnels. - You alumni? - Yeah. Class of '92, I spent a lot of time in those tunnels. Good, they got this set up. Jen, thank you very much. The steam tunnels connect most of the campus, but only some of them are passable. Old chemistry lab connects to the new science center through the library. That's original structure. Isn't there some way to the tunnels through the lower level? No, there isn't. The only way in and out of these tunnels is from the stairwell on the ground level, here and here. - Lieutenant, didn't you say the shooter called you? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Well, if he has hostages, and none of them have cell service, how did he call you? - Maybe he's bluffing. - Maybe he hasn't got to 'em yet. I gotta get down there before he does. Whoa, whoa... Jen, gimme your radio. - In case you need backup. - Thanks. Got a weapon? Why am I not surprised? That's it. I'm leaving. Who's coming? - Fine. - Caroline, no, it's not... Don't boss me around, OK? I'm not some 20-year-old kid. - No, don't... - I'm going for help. No, Caroline, stop! Why do we have to... You guys stay, let her go. You know, 20 years on the job... ...I never once discharged my firearm. Not once. And then this happens in our little town. I know. We have access to the security cameras in the library. I'm signing on now. Lieutenant, look! Give that to Leanne. That's her. - Caroline? - Michael? Michael, can you hear me? It's Caroline! - Caroline, you OK? - I'm... I'm trapped in the library. He's locked us in! Calm down. It's gonna be OK. - Help is on the way. - I couldn't just sit and wait anymore. I know, I'm looking at you right now. I'm looking at the security cam. Now, listen... how many people are still in there? Um... five that I know of. Listen to me. Jeremy's been shot. I think someone's coming! You have to find a place to hide. Right now, Caroline, right now! OK? Please, just find a place where you can be quiet, OK? What is this? What's going on? What is this? - I don't know, we must've lost power. - Fix it! Caroline? You OK? He... he's coming. Logan, do you copy? Would somebody please tell me what's going on in there?! Shh. Be very quiet. I'm here to help. I'm gonna get you out. You just can't make a sound, OK? Shh. There are five others still in the boiler room. - Suzanne Hollander? - Yes. I'm in her class. Wait. A boy is injured, Jeremy Waters. He got shot. OK. I said no cops! Caroline... Oh, I never should have let her go! I gotta go see if I can help her... No, no, you can't. He has guns. You don't. I can't let him hurt somebody because of me. Wait, what do you mean, "because of you?" Do you mind if we talk about the incident? Uh, it was... It was the Friday after Thanksgiving. And I was just watching TV, some cop show marathon or something. Minding my own business, when she busts in on me and just starts laying into me again, you know like, "Shouldn't you be out? Why don't you hang out with the other kids? Don't you have friends from high school you can visit?" And I try to tell her that all the kids that I went to high school with are idiots. Like, it's just how I feel. And... ...she thumps me with a magazine! Rolls up a magazine and hits me with it, like... like... like I'm some kind of animal. Like... like I'm her stupid cat. And then what happened? I got up. She starts backing up like she's scared of me or something. And... and I say... "If you want to hit me, you should just go ahead and do it." And did she? No, she backed up into an end table, and, um... knocked over a lamp. But you kept walking toward her? Yeah, she... she, like, tried to pick the lamp up, but I grabbed hold of her... ...and I said to her, "If you want to hit me, you should just go ahead and do it." We have to move, OK? Jeremy, if I help you, can you walk? - Yeah, I think so. - OK. Ready? One, two, three... Go. Thank you. Michael... thank you. - I was so scared. - Don't thank me, thank Logan. Thank you so much. - Jeremy... - We're doing all we can. We're trying to get somebody in there now. Is... I'm sorry, it's... it's him. It's the shooter. Ken, can you take care of her, please? Ma'am, this way. This is Olsen. I told you not to send any cops in here, and that's specifically what you did! I don't know what you're talking about. - Don't lie to me. - Well, I think you lied to me. I don't think you have any more hostages. Really? You really want to be that cavalier about innocent people's lives? What are you doing? Go! Is it locked? You guys, head to the steam tunnels. Steam tunnels. Straight back. Straight back. It's the door that says "don't enter." Suzanne. So she smacked me. I say, "Hit me again." So she says she's gonna call the cops. I say, "Hit me again or I'll give you something to call the cops about." And did you? Did you hit your mother? Did you hit her? I didn't mean to. I'm not... I'm not crazy, am I? I... I can be fixed, I can change, right? Connor, I'm gonna need you to back up. Are you scared of me? Professor! Professor, come on, let's go! Come on! Open the door! Do you know him? He was a former research subject of mine. So all of this is about you? OK, so how would you like to come in next Thursday, like at 11:00? I feel so weird. I tell you all about myself in here, and you don't tell me anything about you. OK. OK. What do you want to know? I want to know how it felt to watch your mom kill your father. I'm sorry, how did you... how did you know that? It's the digital age, Suzanne. Everything you need to know is just a few keystrokes away. I think that you need to go. No, that's not fair. We had an agreement. Quid pro quo. You can't cheat on your end of the deal. Connor, you're crossing a line. No, I'm just asking, I just want to know, like how it felt to watch your mom shoot your father in the head. I mean, like, is it true that people defecate when they get shot? Did your father crap himself when your mom shot him? He did, didn't he? So it wasn't just his blood you were covered in, it was... - You need to leave right now. - It was his... What? - Get out! - I'm just... I'll tell them you were physically abusive. Fine! Connor, I don't care! Don't you get it, Suzanne? You're just like me. We both have crazy moms. So you... you think that your mother is crazy like mine? No, no, no, I think you're crazy like me. So our moms gotta be kinda similar, right? I never want to see you again. You need to go. Oh, you can't kick me out like that. Get out! Now! You'll see me again. How does it feel, Suzanne? To know that it's because of you that all these people are dead? - What did you do? - - She didn't do anything! He's a psychopath. - Haven't you been listening... - Stop arguing, you guys. We have to get out of here, all right? We need to get Jeremy out of here. He's losing a lot of blood. Come on, put your arm around me. Let's go. Come on. Come on, keep going. Keep walking. Go, go. Go! Give me one more push, all right? Listen to me. You gotta work with us, all right? We're almost there. Ready? You're gonna be fine. - Ready? - One, two three! Don't shoot! It's OK, I'm not gonna shoot. I'm here to help. Who's that? Who's down there? - Logan! - Suzanne, do you need help? Yeah! - You OK, Suzanne? - Yeah, I'm fine, babe. We need help! Please! - How many are left inside? - According to Suzanne, that's it. Everybody's accounted for. Now we just gotta wait for the SWAT to show up and get Connor out. - Who's Connor? - Connor Dryer. He's the shooter. One of Suzanne's former students. That explains a lot. Yeah. This is him. Hello, Connor. She told you my name, didn't she? Yeah, she did. But it doesn't matter. Game over. There's no more hostages. Oh, really? Did you hear that, professor? No more hostages. What... Connor, who are you speaking with? Uh... Connor, what was that? Is someone inside with you? Suzanne? Are you there? - It's me, Dr. Egan. - He has Robert. The next shot won't miss. Connor. Connor, what do we have to do to bring this to an end? - What do you want? - I want Suzanne Hollander in the library in ten minutes, or Dr. Egan dies. Ms. Hollander? It's Jeremy. He... I'm so sorry. ♪ There'll be nothing to fear ♪ Insecurity is clear ♪ Want to just disappear ♪ Disappear from the world ♪ What a wicked world it is ♪ Come around, come around ♪ Come around I have to go back in. ♪ Come around, come around All right. ♪ Come around ♪ Impossible ♪ See we wait for the world ♪ Is it at all sensible? ♪ You should be able... - What are they doing? - They're heading into the tunnel. I'm gonna be listening, OK? - What if he finds the wire? - No, he won't. Anything goes wrong, just say my name and I'm in. OK. So I'm just gonna talk to him - and I'm gonna get him to let Robert go. - Yeah. - OK. - Anything happens to me... Nothing can happen to you. Promise me. OK, let's go. Connor... she was very upset when things didn't work out between you two. - She told you that? - Yes, she did. She wanted to help you. And, of course, you were a very big help to her. I can't remember another time where she talked so highly about, she cared so deeply about a research subject. - Then why did she leave me? - No, no, no... No, as I recall it, it was you who made it impossible for her to continue to see you. Well, you remember the coffee shop, Connor. You tracked her down. You followed her there, right? Connor, what are you doing here? Why won't you return my calls? This is not the time or the place. It's a public place. I'm allowed to drink coffee. We need to talk. It is completely inappropriate that you're here. Are you writing something about me? Of course not. You want to talk? Fine, let's talk. Let's talk about all the letters you've been sending me. Yeah, yeah, let's talk about them. And the e-mails, and the phone calls... - You wouldn't respond to me. - Because you need to stop. You told me love is a choice. I am not an option. I can't choose who I love. You don't love me. How do you know? Because it's called transference... Just because there's a fancy word for it doesn't make it not real! OK, OK... Did your boyfriend find the letters? He's a big Marine, right? Does he wanna beat me up? You need to stop. Right now. I can't. No one's ever paid attention to me before, cared about me. Connor, it is my job to care. - So you're a whore. - What? You get paid to pretend like you care. To feign intimacy. That makes you a whore. I do not need to listen to this. No, all right, all right. - I'll stop sending letters. - Do you promise? What, are you 12? You will speak to me with respect, Connor. You sound like my mother. Can you just...? Connor, please. Just leave me alone. You just... you look so beautiful when you're this angry. No! You see, whores don't say no. Don't you... If you ever come near me again, I will call the police! Do you hear me, Connor? I will call the police! Leave me alone! Suzanne! Why can't you love me? Because you are unlovable, Connor. Just like your mother said. But she regretted that, Connor. She said it... ...and she regretted it the minute she said it. She said it because she's human, she made a mistake. That's what humans do, they make mistakes. She told you about that? - About what she said to me? - Yeah, she told me all about it. But she needed you to leave her alone. You were scaring her. She would've said anything at that point. I scared her? Yeah. But is that what you want? I mean, you want to scare her? Because I think you've succeeded at that. Mm-mm. I want her to love me. Connor... love can't be won through fear. You're not reporting me? I could be fired for this. Well, you could, but I think that would be a significant loss to this institution and to the scientific community and I'm not gonna do it. It's not the first time that I've lost control, though. It's like a piece of me that just... ...shuts off. And I don't know why. I... I got this. This is not conclusive, and you know that. Right. So I want you to give me the Psychopathy Test, also. I just have to know. Suzanne, look... This is the kind of psychosis that makes the world go round. OK? There is a huge preponderance of psychopathic personalities in the political and the business elite of this country! I mean, how do you think they get things done? Lack of empathy. That doesn't make me feel any better. I... Will you please just run the test? Of course. Connor? You armed? No. Can I check? Yes. I missed you, Suzanne. It's... it's good to see you again. Can he go? Yeah, sure. See ya later, doc. Connor. Remember what we talked about. Go, please. So I'm here. - What did you want to talk... - You told me love is a choice, right? I mean, 'cause if you could, you probably wouldn't have loved your father, right? - What? - It would have made it easier for you... ...when your mother killed him. What... what are you talking about? And then you found Dr. Egan. He became like a father to you, right? Connor... And I couldn't imagine losing a father twice. Connor... - Please, don't... - You don't love me. But if you won't love me... Connor... ...then you'll fear me. Connor! Tell me more about your mother. Uh, more about that night, or...? Just whatever you remember about her. Mm... She was very smart. Meticulous. She used to read the paper from cover to cover every day. - And your dad? - He read it, too. He just, um... He thought that the paper was something to be shared. You know, like a family affair. Everyone takes a section, reads it, reports back. My mom didn't think like that. She'd get so irritated when he'd bring it up, you know, like, "Why do you have to talk about every thought that comes into your head?" So... that's usually how it started. How... how what usually started? The fighting. Suzanne, stop. Let him go. Get up. See, we are just alike, you and me. And you're gonna have your chance to prove it. Just, we're not there yet. And you must be the fiance, right? Logan? You're pretty good. Don't hurt her, OK? I won't. As long as you do exactly as I say. Put the gun down. OK, so how do you read the paper? Alone, I guess. So you don't read the paper like your mother did, cover to cover? And when you read the paper, what kind of stories are you gravitated toward? Is that relevant? Um... I guess I gravitate towards stories of my... ...um, my... my area of study. OK. What about the science attracts you? What kind of details are you looking for? What catches your eye? I mean, I don't think I look for myself or that I look for things that relate to my specific research, but, you know, if there's a quote, I might read it, but I don't think that I would search it out, you know, and really try to find things about myself. It better be tight. I'm gonna check. "While the psychopath cannot feel true empathy or love, his inflated sense of self worth makes him believe that he loves any individual who gives him the attention he feels he deserves. This is especially true for those who were abused or neglected as children. Take, for example, the case of Connor..." What's he talking about, Suzanne? He's quoting my thesis paper. I don't know how he got it. "Connor scored a 37 on the Psychopathy Test, a score indicating the inability to feel empathy, a necessary precondition for love. His brain scan showed a complete lack of activity in his orbitofrontal cortex. And yet Connor claimed to be in love with me. Thus, he translated the indulgence of his narcissism as love?" - Are you kidding me? - Connor, it's true. What you feel for me is not love. You used me! You never cared about me. You said you did, but you had made up your mind about me from the moment you met me, just like everyone else. You know that's not true! Of course I cared about you! It was my job to try and figure you out - so I could help you! - Why didn't you just look inside your own head? You're just as screwed up as I am. Let's talk more about your parents. You said they... they fought. You know, I think about that night a lot. I dream about it, what happened. But in my dreams, it's not my mom shooting my father. I'm shooting my father. What's wrong? You don't want your boyfriend to find out that you have the same biological make up as Charles Manson? You see that? That is Suzanne's orbitofrontal cortex, right there. See that void? You see that one? Hey, look at me. Look at me. I'm talking to you! Do you see it? - Connor, stop. - Same void. What do you think about your girlfriend now? - What does it mean, Suzanne? - She didn't want to tell you, 'cause she knew you'd leave her. That you wouldn't love her anymore. Well, I don't care. What do you mean you don't care? - Doesn't matter. - You're not worried... ...she might go all psycho one day and kill you in front of your kids? - Huh? Hey, hey, hey! - Connor, stop it! Just like her mother did? Why? Because I love her. And some brain scan's not gonna change that. You can't love her. I love her. She's mine. - Connor, no! - Aah! - That's it. That's it. - What are you doing? - You can't go in there. - Somebody just got shot. - Can't you wait? - I gotta go in. Please, the SWAT team will be here any minute. Forget it, Jen. Forget it, OK? When the SWAT team gets here, if they get here... ...tell them what to do. Jen... it's OK. That punk has taken our town and flipping it upside down. I'm not gonna put up with it anymore. If he comes out of that building before I do, you take him out yourself. - Connor, put the gun down! - You shouldn't have done that. Don't tell me what I shouldn't do. Just put the gun down! You keep sounding like my mother. Do you want me to play that role? 'Cause I can do that. - I can do that. Stop it! - No. Connor, this is about you and me. This has nothing to do with him. Just put it down. No! And you can't make me! Listen to me! Put the gun down! Connor, freeze! - Stay right there. - It's me, it's Lieutenant Olsen. I've been talking on the phone to you, pal. Connor! I told you if I saw any cops, I'd start killing hostages. Listen, listen, Connor. The SWAT team is on the way. Trust me, you want to talk to me and not them. Pick up my bag. I told you, if I saw cops... - Connor, drop it! - Shut up. - Connor... - Whatever. Come on! Jen, get a medic in here right away. - You got hit anywhere else? - No, it's just the leg. Hey, the SWAT team is here. Do you know where they went? I don't know, but Olsen followed them. - Which way? - Down the hall to the right. SWAT command, do you read? SWAT command, over. We shouldn't send them in yet. Look, we appreciate all your help, but I'm going to turn this over to SWAT. Sergeant? We read, over. You've never dealt with anything on this scale before, have you? - No. - OK, listen... We got a shooter in there who's holding my fiance by gunpoint. You send in SWAT, he's gonna kill her. Do you trust your Lieutenant Olsen? More than anything in the world. OK. OK, well, let's let him try to defuse the situation, OK? All right? SWAT commander, stand down. I repeat, stand down. We still have an active hostage situation. Take a seat. Just like old times. So let's talk. I'm not really in the mood for this, Connor. What do you want? I want to feel comfortable. And this is the only place I've ever felt comfortable, but you took that away from me. - You made that choice. - No, I didn't! You threw me out! We're gonna have a session. Right now! Fine. So, what do you want to ask me? How did you, uh... read my thesis? Dr. Egan's the only one who's ever seen it. Please. That was child's play. You should really think of a better password for your laptop. You broke into my office and went through my things? You've got quite the stash in there. Fascinating newspaper clippings. What was it, um... "Mother Kills Father in Front of Daughter." And then there was, "Suburban Mother Goes Murderous." My personal favorite was "The Bloodsoaked Baby." Stop it. I can't take this anymore. If you're gonna kill me, Connor, just do it! All the fun would be over. Oh, I almost forgot. I have something of yours. I guess, um, Dr. Egan gave you that test to see if you really are a psychopath? Wanna see the results? Yep. Right here. Certifiable. Just like me. - You're lying. - Why would I lie? Huh? Why? No, look right here. "Childhood behavior difficulties," you got a two. That's the same thing I got. Um, "Shallow emotional responsiveness." You a one. I got a two on that one. - Please, just stop. - Hitting too close to home? - I am nothing like you. - Oh, I think you are. I think you would have killed me back there if I hadn't drawn my knife. - I saw it in your eyes. - Yeah, and you would have liked that, right? I want to know, how does it feel, to know that it's because of you that all these people are dead? Oh, I will not own that, Connor! - You did this! - That's... That's what I thought you'd say. Right here, number three: "Little or no compassion or guilt." If you're gonna kill me, just pull the trigger! Is that what you want? Pull the trigger! You want me to? Because I will! No, you won't, because that was never part of your plan! You were never gonna kill me. I knew you'd understand. Yeah. Because if I kill you, then I'm just as crazy as you are, right? That's been your plan. It would be better than suicide. Come on, Suzanne, do it. I know you want to. And no one will know. It'll be between you and I. You could say it was self defense. Come on. End it. Get on your knees. Get on your knees! I just wanted you to take the pain away. I know. I love you, Suzanne.

You know the rules. No passing any personal items. And keep your hands where I can see them. Mom. If you say so. It's Suzanne. I wrote you off a long time ago. I'm sure you did. To tell you the truth, I've spent my entire life trying to write you off as well, but... I just can't. Well, you should. What do I care? You shouldn't. I've been a horrible daughter. I haven't come to visit you once in 25 years, and you're my mother. Hell of a mother I've been. You have been an enormous part of my life. More than you will ever know. I'm sorry. Don't be. It's who I am. It's actually why I'm here today. I, um.... I wanted to open this in front of you. It's my Psychopathy Test results. It's going to tell me whether or not I'm like you. You need a test to tell you that? I've spent my entire life terrified that I am some ticking time bomb, because I am your daughter. Not a big believer in free will, huh? You think I couldn't control what I did? Now you're gonna try to make me feel guilty for your miserable life? That's rich. Look at me. Ask me if I care. I'm gonna be OK. Big surprise. Maybe I'll see you next week. No, don't bother. I will see you next week, Mom. - Oh, this is horrible. - Oh, my God. This is so bad. - It's horrible. - How's your leg? It's pretty good. Gives me an excuse for losing, so that's good. You are such a bad loser. Oh. Hey. Ask me. It's... it's a standing offer, you know that. Just ask me. Be careful, don't... don't hurt your leg! It's OK.
