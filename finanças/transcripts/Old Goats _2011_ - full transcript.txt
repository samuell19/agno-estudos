[UPBEAT MUSIC] [UPBEAT MUSIC] ...SO, UM, THERE MIGHT BE A FEW BARNACLES ON IT BUT I'VE BEEN ASSURED BY SOME OF YOU THAT HAVE HAD MORE RECENT SAILING EXPERIENCE THAN I HAVE THAT IN JUST A MATTER OF A FEW HOURS OUT ON THE STRAITS OF JUAN DE FUCA AND ALL THOSE BARNACLES WILL SLOUGH OFF AND IT'LL BE SMOOTH SAILING FROM THERE ON OUT ACROSS THE PACIFIC TO THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. AND AFTER SOME RECUPERATIVE TIME ON OAHU, MAYBE ON TO KAUAI, AND THEN I'LL SET MY SIGHTS TO MOVE A LITTLE FURTHER WEST AND I'M NOT SURE WHETHER IT'S GONNA BE JAPAN OR THE PHILIPPINES. MAYBE I'LL WANT TO UH, MAYBE I'LL WANT TO SAIL AROUND THE WORLD! [LAUGHTER] AND I CAN ASSURE YOU, TAKING SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS IN INSPECTING MY BOAT AND PROVISIONING MY BOAT. I'VE STOCKED THE BOAT THOROUGHLY. THE FACT IS, I HAVE 480,000 CALORIES OF FOODSTUFF ON BOARD. I'VE CALCULATED THAT WOULD LAST ME SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF ALMOST TWO MONTHS. I'VE HAD AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN PRACTICE SESSIONS HERE JUST RECENTLY OUT IN THE BAY. AND I PRACTICE THINGS LIKE SCANNING THE HORIZON AND THE FOREGROUND LOOKING FOR DEBRIS THAT I DON'T WANT TO RUN OVER. AND ALSO, I'VE GOT A HANDBOOK. I BOUGHT A HANDBOOK. IT'S ALL ABOUT LIVING AT SEA IN A RAFT. HOW TO SURVIVE IN AN EMERGENCY. I'VE EVEN GOT A GPS TO HELP ME WITH MY CELESTIAL NAVIGATION. I'VE BEEN REALLY HONING MY SKILLS AS A SAILOR AND THEY ARE JUST A LITTLE BIT RUSTY BUT I'VE BEEN REAL PLEASED WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING. KEEP IN MIND, I HAVE LIVED ON THIS BOAT FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS NOW AND WHEN YOU'RE CONFINED TO 70 SQUARE FEET OVER 30 YEARS, YOU REALLY GET TO KNOW ALL THE LITTLE NOOKS AND CRANNIES AND THEY BECOME REALLY ALMOST A PART OF YOU. YOU KNOW, I KNOW WE ALL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT BRITT BUT, BY GOLLY, WE OUGHT TO BE REALLY HAPPY FOR HIM. HE WORKED FOR QUALITY AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE ALL OF HIS LIFE THAT I KNOWN. HELL, I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR LONGER THAN YOU HAVE. PROBABLY 30-40 YEARS THAT I'VE KNOWN HIM. YOU KNOW, THIS IS A GUY THAT'S NEVER BEEN ANYWHERE. HE'S NEVER BEEN NORTH TO CANADA. HE'S NEVER BEEN TO MONTANA. I DON'T THINK HE'S EVEN BEEN SOUTH TO OREGON. AND HERE HE'S UNDERGOING THIS GREAT ADVENTURE. WE KNOW THE BOAT IS OLD AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT VERY WELL EQUIPPED BUT HE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THAT. HE WANTS TO GO AND I TELL YOU, I'M SO HAPPY FOR HIM I JUST... [TALKING CONTINUES IN BACKGROUND] BOB BURKHOLDER LOOKED LIKE HE COULD TIP OVER DEAD AT ANY MOMENT BUT HE HAD MORE ENERGY THAN ALMOST EVERYBODY I KNEW. [MUSIC] I'D ONLY MET BOB RECENTLY IN MY SENIOR FITNESS CLASS. THAT'S RIGHT. I'M A SENIOR. THAT DOESN'T QUITE SIT RIGHT WITH ME EITHER BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL ME THESE DAYS. BOB ASKED ME FOR A RIDE HOME ONE DAY WITH SOME STORY ABOUT A FENDER-BENDER THAT LEFT HIS CAR IN THE SHOP. [BACKGROUND CONVERSATION] WELL, A RIDE HERE AND THERE QUICKLY TURNED INTO A FULL-TIME JOB IN A MATTER OF WEEKS. BUT IT DID GET ME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND THE THING WAS, I SORT OF ENJOYED HIS COMPANY. HE TURNED OUT TO BE A FASCINATING GUY AND I BECAME PRETTY FOND OF HIM. STILL LAYING OVER THE PILE OF ROCKS SO I ASSUME THE SHEEP WERE STILL THERE. OH, YEAH. THAT'S THE WAY I SHOT THE SUCKER AND HE DROPPED LIKE A SACK OF SHIT. I'LL BE DARNED. I JUST NAILED HIM RIGHT TO THE SPOT AND I HAD TO BECAUSE HE'S RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF. YEAH. HAD HE KICKED ONCE, HE'D BEEN OVER. WOW. SO I RAN DOWN AND JUMPED ON TOP OF HIM AND -- BOB'S TALES ABOUT HUNTING MOOSE AND ELK AND BIG HORNED SHEEP IN MONTANA AND EVERYWHERE ELSE YOU CAN THINK OF, PARACHUTING IN WORLD WAR II, CRASHING PLANES IN ALASKA, AND ALL THAT STUFF, IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE. HE'S WRITING MEMOIRS OF SOME SORT AND FEELS COMPELLED TO UPDATE ME ON HIS PROGRESS. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I BELIEVE EVERYTHING HE SAYS BUT IT SURE IS INTERESTING COMPARED TO MY EXECUTIVE CAREER IN FINANCE. I RETIRED ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO. AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT MY WIFE AND I TOLD ALL OUR FRIENDS. TRUTH BE TOLD, I WAS EASED OUT WITH A VERY LARGE, ENCOURAGING CHECK. I DO SORT OF MISS GOING TO THE OFFICE EVERY MORNING AND JUST HAVING THAT EVERY DAY ROUTINE. SO NOW EVERY MORNING I GET UP AT THE REGULAR TIME AND SPEND A COUPLE HOURS IN MY HOME OFFICE MANAGING MY RETIREMENT FUNDS. SO HAULING BOB FROM PLACE TO PLACE HAS BECOME A CONSIDERABLE PART OF MY DAILY ROUTINE. BOB HAS CHOIR PRACTICE ON WEDNESDAYS AND FRIDAYS. SURPRISINGLY, HE'S A BASS. [CHOIR SINGING] HALLELUJAH! HALLELUJAH! HALLELUJAH! AMEN! [SINGING CONTINUES] TUESDAY AND THURSDAY WAS MEN'S OATMEAL CLUB. YOU EVER HEARD OF AN OATMEAL CLUB? IT'S AT THE SENIOR CENTER AND YOU SHOULD SEE SOME OF THESE GUYS. BOB'S PRESIDENT! HE LEADS POST-MEAL DISCUSSIONS AND USUALLY THOSE GET TRANSFORMED INTO ARGUMENTS OF SOME KIND. AND THERE'S BOB'S GIRLFRIEND, CAROLYN. [MUSIC] I CAN'T IMAGINE WHERE HE GETS THAT KIND OF ENERGY. BUT MONDAY NIGHTS AT COREY'S CAFÃ© DOWN BY THE HARBOR IS WHERE BOB SEEMS TO FIT IN THE BEST. COREY WOULD CLOSE UP AROUND 7:00. BUT HE'D KEEP THE PLACE AVAILABLE TO THE OLD TIMERS. ALL GUYS LOCAL BUT I'D NEVER MET THEM BEFORE. NO GIRLFRIENDS, NO WIVES, NO ORGANIZED AGENDA, NO GUEST SPEAKERS. JUST GUYS BS'ING ABOUT NOTHING IN PARTICULAR. I HAD DRIVEN BY COREY'S THOUSANDS OF TIMES BUT I'D NEVER EVEN BEEN IN THE PLACE UNTIL LAST MONTH. [LAUGHTER] TONIGHT AT COREY'S WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE NORM. ONE OF THESE GUYS IS APPARENTLY LEAVING TOMORROW ON A LITTLE SAILBOAT FOR HAWAII. BOB HAD THIS BIG SEND-OFF CELEBRATION. SLIDE SHOW. PLANNED COURSE DETAILS, LOCATIONS OF VISITS AND A PAINFULLY LONG PRESENTATION ABOUT ALL THE PREP AND PLANNING THIS GUY HAD GONE THROUGH. CONGRATULATIONS! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THINK I'LL HAVE A GOOD TRIP. ALTHOUGH I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY INCREDIBLE WHAT BRITT WAS DOING, I WAS PRETTY SURE THIS WAS THE LAST TIME WE'D EVER SEE THE GUY. - HAVE A GOOD TRIP THERE, BRITT. - THANK YOU, FRANK. BOB WAS PARTICULARLY EXCITED BECAUSE BRITT HAD AGREED TO LOAN HIM HIS TRUCK WHILE HE WAS GONE. AND THAT MEANT I WAS SOON TO BE RELEASED FROM MY DRIVING DUTIES. OF COURSE, IN THE MORNING WHEN I TOOK BOB DOWN TO WAVE GOODBYE, EVERYTHING CHANGED. BRITT! HEY, BRITT! WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT GOING? GOOD GOD, BEN! WE HAD THE SLIDESHOW LAST NIGHT. WE GOT EVERYBODY EXCITED ABOUT YOU GOING AND NOW YOU'RE CRAPPING OUT! YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'RE A WIMP. I WAS HOPING -- GODDAMMIT! -- I WAS HOPING YOU'RE CHANGING YOUR LIFE! WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. - WHAT? - HANG ON. LET'S GO GET A CUP OF COFFEE AND COOL DOWN. WELL, THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA. THAT DAMN SON OF A BITCH! - THANK YOU. - YOU'RE WELCOME. WELL, IT WAS AN AMBITIOUS IDEA THAT JUST DIDN'T COME TO FRUITION. DON'T GET TOO DOWN ON YOURSELF. THERE'S A BUNCH OF ADVENTURES TO BE HAD. YOU KNOW? I MEAN, THERE'S ALWAYS A SILVER LINING TO EVERY EXPERIENCE, SO. OH, THAT'S BULLSHIT. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOING TO GLOSS OVER THIS THING. YOU STARTED SOMETHING, YOU OUGHT TO FINISH IT. I THOUGHT I MADE MYSELF CLEAR, BOB. I'M NOT GOING. END OF STORY. SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW? OH, I HADN'T EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. UH, I MAYBE COULD GET MY OLD JOB BACK. THAT'S INCREDULOUS! GOTCHA NO IMAGINATION? YOU WANT TO BE A GREASE MONKEY THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, FOR CHRIST SAKES? MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO TAKE UP THE GAME OF GOLF. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, DO SOME RELAXING THINGS. THAT'S A STUPID GAME. WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT GOLF. YOU KNOW, THIS IS GOING NOWHERE. I STILL NEED TO USE YOUR TRUCK. [BACKGROUND TALKING] [MOTOR STARTS] A STANDARD TRANSMISSION? YEAH, I KNOW. PAY ATTENTION. WHEN YOU DRIVE, IT'S A FULL-TIME JOB. DON'T BE TALKING WITH SOMEBODY OR DAYDREAMING. NO, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE USE OF IT AND I'LL PROMISE I'LL HAVE IT BACK AT 8 O'CLOCK. HOW'S THAT? TONIGHT. OKAY, YOU GO AHEAD AND TAKE ON OUT OF HERE. DON'T FORGET TO RELEASE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE. [MOTOR ROARS AND CHUGS AWAY] [MUSIC] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] HEY, BRITT? IT'S DAVE. I GOT A PHONE CALL HERE FOR YOU. BOB WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. - BOB. - BRITT, IS THAT YOU FINALLY? YEAH, YOU PROMISED TO BE BACK SO I COULD HAVE THE PICKUP. WELL, I KNOW. BUT YOU KNOW, THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW THAN THEY WERE AND I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. WELL, GODDAMMIT, YOU SHOULD SHOW A LITTLE MORE CONSIDERATION AND -- YEAH, THIS IS UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES, BRITT. YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND I'M REALLY SORRY. I APOLOGIZE. YOU KNOW, THE TRUCK'S IN FINE SHAPE. I CHANGED THE OIL. WELL, A LOT OF GOOD THAT DOES ME RIGHT NOW. YOU DUMB SHIT! I TRUSTED YOU. I HAD PLANS TO MAKE AND THEN YOU'VE LEFT ME HIGH AND DRY. WELL, I'M SORRY BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S UH, THINGS JUST DEVELOPED HERE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I PLANNED AND UH, YOU KNOW, I'LL HELP GET IT BACK TO YOU. EVENTUALLY. EVENTUALLY? WELL, YEAH! I DON'T KNOW -- EXACTLY WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "EVENTUALLY?" I EXPECT IT BACK AT A MINIMUM IN -- LATER ON THIS MORNING! WELL, I KNOW BUT I CAN'T DO THAT. THAT'S WHY I CALLED, TO TELL YOU THAT, YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY SORRY BUT UH -- EVENTS HERE TRANSPIRED AND I JUST CAN'T GET IT BACK THAT SOON. I KNOW. I KNOW. ANYWAY, UH -- OKAY. I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. NO -- ANYWAY, I THOUGHT I'D GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU AND LET YOU -- BOB CAN'T GET MY TRUCK BACK IN TIME AND I NEED A LIFT. CAN YOU GIVE ME A LIFT? YEAH. YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO VERY FAR. WHERE YOU GOT TO GO DOWNTOWN OR SOMETHING? I MEAN IF THE CUSTOMERS LIKE ME AND I DO GOOD WORK, I MEAN, WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO TAKE ME BACK? I MEAN, I NEED SOMETHING TO DO. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ON A PERMANENT OR EVEN FULL-TIME BASIS. I'D BE WILLING TO WORK PART-TIME. WEEKENDS, IF NECESSARY. WELL... TO BE HONEST, BRITT. I MEAN, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THAT GOOD LATELY. THERE'S JUST BEEN SOME -- YOU'VE SLOWED DOWN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT YOU'VE MADE SOME MISTAKES, THERE'S BEEN SOME COMPLAINTS FROM CUSTOMERS. WELL, THERE WAS THE ONE ISSUE WITH MISS HAGGERTY. REMEMBER HER? MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW HER. SEAN, WHO WAS HERE AT THE TIME CHANGED HER OIL AND THE CROSS-STRUT -- THE LUG NUT AND THE -- NO. BRITT. LISTEN. IT'S NOT.... LISTEN, NONE OF THAT STUFF MATTERS. OKAY? WHEN YOU QUIT IT WAS THE BEST THING FOR BOTH OF US. I'M SORRY. OKAY? I AM. I -- WELL... I UNDERSTAND, TRAVIS. AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE THE BOSS, TOO. SO...OKAY. WELL, I WON'T TAKE ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME. I'LL BE ON MY WAY. I'LL SEE YOU AROUND. SO, WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE NOT DRIVING BOB AROUND? [LIGHT-HEARTED MUSIC] DO YOU KNOW GOLF IS A VERY THERAPEUTIC KIND OF A SPORT? YOU GET OUT HERE IN THE OPEN AIR, GET OUT OF THE HOUSE, CLEAR YOUR MIND, REALLY FOCUS YOUR CONCENTRATION. IT'S VERY FREEING. [MUSIC] SEE WHY SO MANY PEOPLE LOVE GOLF? BECAUSE THE FEELING YOU GET AFTER A REALLY TERRIFIC SHOT. I USED TO HAVE A TERRIBLE SLICE OFF THE TEE AND NOW I'VE CORRECTED THAT. I CAN HIT IT STRAIGHT. I DON'T HAVE THE DISTANCE I WANT YET. BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IS CONTINUING TO IMPROVE AND STRIVING TO EXCEL. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] YAH! SO WHAT'S NEXT FOR YOU? [DEEP SIGH] WELL. UH, I DON'T KNOW. I LOOK AT BOB AND I THINK THAT MAYBE, MAYBE I LIKE HIS LIFESTYLE SOME. SO... YEAH, HE'S A CHARACTER. SEEMS TO GET AROUND A LOT. YEAH. HE'S GOT A WOMAN IN HIS LIFE, TOO, YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S -- I THINK THAT GIVES HIM A LOTTA, LOTTA THINGS TO THINK ABOUT AND TO DO THINGS WITH. YOU THINKING ABOUT A WOMAN? WELL, YEAH, AS A MATTER OF FACT. I THINK -- HA-HA! A WOMAN WOULD BE UH, OFFER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COMPANIONSHIP AND NOW I'VE GOT LOTS OF TIME ON MY HAND, BEING RETIRED. I COULD PROBABLY RECIPROCATE IN SOME FASHION OR ANOTHER. SO, I'M GIVING IT SOME THOUGHT, I THINK THAT WOULD BE A...AN IDEA. I DON'T KNOW. THEY CAN BE A LITTLE SPOOKY. YOU WANT MY WIFE? - NO. - JUST KIDDING. [LAUGHTER] NO, NO, NO, NO. I'M NOT GOING THERE. BUT, HEY! DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS TONIGHT? UMM... NO. I DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS TONIGHT.

MAYBE HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY SELF-CONFIDENCE ABOUT MAKING IT. WELL, HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN SAILING, FOR PETE'S SAKE? WELL, WHAT'D HE SAY TO YOU? WHEN YOU ASKED HIM? WELL, HE DIDN'T SAY A WHOLE LOT. DID HE SAY ANYTHING? WE SAID WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND AND HE KEPT GOING ON AND ON, BABBLING ABOUT HE'S HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS. SECOND THOUGHTS. FINALLY, HE SAID, "I'M NOT GOING." HE'S NOT GOING. SO THAT WAS FINAL, YOU KNOW, AND, AND -- SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING REALLY ABOUT YOU. SHE JUST SAID, DID I KNOW HOW TO GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU AND DID I THINK YOU GUYS WOULD BE INTERESTED IN GETTING TOGETHER? AND I SAID, "YEAH!" I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE. SO IT'S SET UP. I GOT YOU GETTING TOGETHER FOR DRINKS TOMORROW NIGHT. OH, NO. YEAH. HEY, I TOLD HER YOU DIDN'T HAVE A PHONE BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE YOU A MESSAGE. I WISH YOU HADN'T DONE THAT. YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T WANT TO SEE HER. WE HAD A GOOD TIME AT THE PARTY BUT UH, YOU KNOW, I REALLY TOLD HER SOME THINGS THAT PROBABLY -- STRETCHED THE TRUTH A LITTLE? WELL, WHEN SHE REALLY FINDS OUT ABOUT WHO I AM AND STUFF LIKE THAT. THAT THING'LL GO LIKE THAT. DOESN'T MATTER. IT WAS A PARTY. IT WAS JUST SMALL TALK. BESIDES, YOU GOT OVERNIGHT TO GET USED TO THE IDEA. I SET YOU GUYS UP FOR DRINKS. - NO. - I GOT IT ALL SET UP. - NO! - YUP. - NO, IT, NOT GONNA -- - SURE IT IS. IT'S NOT GONNA WORK. JUST THINK ABOUT IT OVERNIGHT. [MOTOR CHUGGING] YOU KNOW, DAVE, I BROUGHT MY MANUSCRIPT ALONG AND I -- OH, REALLY? -- THE OTHER DAY YOU WANTED TO READ IT AND I SAID, "NO", BUT I'VE CHANGED MY MIND. OH, NO KIDDING. AND UH, YEAH. I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU WERE CARRYING AROUND IN THAT PURSE. WELL, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN, I'VE BEEN -- [LAUGHTER] THAT'S NOT A PURSE, YOU BASTARD.

I WANT YOU TO REALLY UH, YOU KNOW, GIVE IT YOUR ALL IF YOU WOULD AND BE VERY HONEST ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK OF IT. "SKIRTING THE EDGE." I LIKE THAT TITLE. STORY OF MY LIFE. I'LL BE HAPPY TO READ IT. THANK YOU. [MUSIC] I TOOK FLORENCE COYOTE HUNTING EVERY DAY BECAUSE THAT ACTIVITY INVOLVED WALKING MANY MILES ACROSS THE KANSAS PRAIRIE AND I WAS HOPING TO WEAR HER OUT TO AN EARLY BED SO THAT I COULD JOIN MY OTHER GIRLFRIEND, FRANCES. THE TORRID AFFAIR I HAD WITH FRANCES WAS ALSO DOOMED TO FAILURE. SOMEHOW, I KNEW THAT ONE BUILT ON SEX ALONE COULD NOT LAST. DESPITE HER DEVOTION, I ALSO INTUITIVELY KNEW IF I DIDN'T LEAVE HER SOON, WE WOULD MARRY AND THAT WOULD BE THE LIFETIME DISASTER FOR BOTH OF US. MOST OF MY SEXUAL EXPERIENCES ARE A BLUR. THEY ARE COMPLETELY FUZZY. AFTER I KNOCKED UP HELEN, I BEGAN TO LOSE COUNT OF MY PARTNERS. TODAY, I ESTIMATE SLEEPING WITH AT LEAST 50 OR 60 WOMEN OVER MY LIFETIME. I'M NOT PROUD OF THAT. [CRAZY GUITAR] FOR A WHILE THERE, MY BUDDIES AND I MADE A GAME OF IT SEEING WHO COULD RACK UP A LARGER COUNT... A LARGER COUNT. UNLIKE SOME OF THEM, I NEVER DID FORCE MYSELF ON ANYONE BUT THAT'S LITTLE CAUSE TO CELEBRATE. OUR PASSION ENSLAVED US AND WOULD ULTIMATELY LEAD ME TO A MORE DEVIANT BEHAVIOR LATER ON. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] ONCE SHE FOUND OUT THAT I WASN'T REALLY WHAT SHE THOUGHT I WAS, THAT I'M NOT -- YOU KNOW, YOU LIED TO HER. -- A RETIRED ROMANTICALLY-INCLINED SAILOR OR -- I EVEN TOLD HER I WAS IN THE OIL BUSINESS FOR GOD'S SAKE. I KNOW! AND THAT WAS A LIE. YOU SEE, BRITT, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. FIND SOMEBODY YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIE TO, SOMEBODY YOU'RE COMPATIBLE WITH AND YOU'LL JUST BE FINE. TAKE IT FROM ME. I'VE BEEN AROUND THE POND, YOU KNOW. I TELL YOU, A WOMAN COULDN'T EVEN CONTACT YOU IF SHE WANTED TO. YOU DON'T HAVE A CELL PHONE, YOU DON'T HAVE A RADIO, YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER. I DON'T NEED ANY OF THAT ELECTRONIC GADGETRY. THAT'S HOW I MET CAROLYN, WAS ON THE COMPUTER. [GRUNTS] GET MY GROCERIES HERE. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ONE MORE TIME. I WANT YOU TO GET A PHONE, I WANT YOU TO GET A COMPUTER, AND I WANT YOU TO GROW UP. YOU CAN DO IT. YOU'RE SERIOUS. I DON'T NEED ANY OF THAT STUFF, BOB. HEY, I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU AGAIN. THINK THAT GODDAMN BRITT WOULD HELP ME WITH THE GROCERIES. [JAZZY MUSIC] [JAZZY MUSIC] [CELL PHONE RINGING] THIS IS DAVE. SEE THIS WHERE IT SAYS WIRELESS NETWORKS DETECTED? YEAH. - OKAY. - WELL -- SO IT'S BUILT INTO THE COMPUTER, RIGHT? WELL, SORT OF. I MEAN, THE INTERNET IS NOT LIKE RADIO. I THOUGHT THE INTERNET WAS BUILT INTO THE COMPUTER. WELL, NOT QUITE. ACCESS TO IT IS BUILT IN. AND SO, I MEAN YOU, YOU HAVE TO GET TO IT. IT'S OUT THERE. IT'S OUT THERE BUT YOU HAVE TO GET TO IT EITHER BY A CABLE CONNECTION OR AN ANTENNA OF SOME SORT. YOU MEAN, IT'S OUT THERE KIND OF LIKE GOD'S OUT THERE? WELL, KIND OF LIKE RADIO'S OUT THERE. OH, RADIO. - AND TV IS OUT THERE. - OKAY. YOU KNOW? SO IT'S SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THAT. BOB WAS SAYING IF I GOT ON THE INTERNET I COULD FIND PLACES TO DATE WOMEN. ADDRESSES. TELEPHONE NUMBERS. HE'S RIGHT. THERE ARE THOSE KIND OF PLACES. I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT THEM. BOB'S PROBABLY A BETTER GUY FOR YOU TO ASK. UM, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT TO BUY SOMETHING ON AN AUCTION WEBSITE, I'M YOUR MAN. I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. CAN'T YOU PUT ME ON THE INTERNET, THOUGH? I CAN GET YOU ONTO THE NET AND CONNECT IT UP WITH E-MAIL AND SO FORTH. YEAH. GOOD. DO IT. [MUSIC ENDS ABRUPTLY] I GOT ONTO THAT SITE, WEBSITE AND I PUT IN A PROFILE AND-- WHAT'S A, WHAT'S A PROFILE? I GOT, HUH? WHAT'S A PROFILE? WELL, IT'S, YOU JUST TELL WHO YOU ARE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, TELL OR GIVE SOME OF YOUR BACKGROUND OR SAY YOU'RE A SAILOR, YOU'RE A RETIRED. YOU'RE A FISHERMAN. YOU LIKE TO DO AND THINGS THAT YOU LIKE TO DO. AND YOU NEED LOTS OF PICTURES. YOU NEED PICTURES OF YOU ON THE BOAT. NOT JUST YOU BUT, YOU KNOW, YOUR FRIENDS AND ON PICNICS AND -- DO YOU THINK I'M NARCISSTIC OR SOMETHING? THAT I GOTTA HAVE ALL THESE PICTURES? I DIDN'T HEAR IT. WHAT? DO YOU THINK I'M NARCISSTIC THAT I GOTTA HAVE ALL THESE PICTURES? FORGET IT. FORGET IT. WELL, YEAH, I DON'T UNDERSTAND. OKAY. ALRIGHT. I'M SORRY, I'M NOT HEARING VERY REAL TONIGHT. UM, ANYWAY, UM, DO YOU HAVE A CAMERA? NO, I DON'T HAVE A CAMERA. WHY DO I NEED A CAMERA? WELL, HELL, YOU CAN... WELL, YOU SHOULD GET ONE BUT YOU CAN USE MINE. BETTER YET, I'LL TAKE THE PICTURES. [SIGHING] REMEMBER, YOU HAVE TO DO LAUNDRY IN THE MORNING. YEP, I REMEMBER. I KNOW. WHAT? THIS, THIS JUST WASN'T MY IDEA OF RETIREMENT, DAVID. YOU KNOW? YOU STAYING OUT LATE AT SOME SEEDY MEN'S CLUB AND I SIT HERE ALONE. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO PALM SPRINGS? I THOUGHT WE WERE PLANNING ON BUYING SOMETHING DOWN THERE. WELL, YOU KIND OF PLANNED THAT. YOU AGREED TO IT JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO. YOU SOUNDED ENTHUSIASTIC LIKE THAT'S WHAT YOU REALLY WANTED TO DO, TOO. I JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT NOW. I'M HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH ALL OF THIS. I'VE ONLY BEEN RETIRED FOR TWO MONTHS. WELL, THAT'S FINE EXCEPT THAT THE TIME TO BUY DOWN AT PALM SPRINGS IS RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW THAT. PRICES HAVE NEVER BEEN LOWER BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY. WE HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN DOWN THERE LOOKING. YOU REALLY NEED TO BOOK THOSE PLANE TICKETS FOR US AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. LIKE TOMORROW. WHY DON'T YOU BOOK 'EM? LEARN TO USE THE DAMN COMPUTER. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS. DAVID, BOOK THE TICKETS TOMORROW. I CAN'T. I HAVE PLANS TOMORROW AND WE'VE GOT THAT DINNER THING TOMORROW NIGHT. PLANS? PLANS FOR WHAT? [MUSIC] [MUSIC] A GOOD-LOOKING PROFILE IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT THIS PROFILE STANDS OUT FROM ALL THE OTHERS. SEE, THERE'S ALL KINDS OF STUFF OUT THERE. MM-HM. AND YOU NEED TO STAND OUT AS AN INDIVIDUAL OR SOMEONE THAT COULD REALLY BE. THE GALS WOULD BE ATTRACTED TO. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF GUYS WILL JUST JUMP RIGHT IN AND START EH, YOU KNOW, THEY CALL 20 OR 30 GALS ALL AT ONCE AND MAN, THAT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL. I CAN'T CONTACT THEM UNTIL THEY CONTACT ME, RIGHT? WELL, THAT'S THE POINT. THAT'S THE POINT. YOU WAIT FOR THEM TO CONTACT YOU AND THEN YOU DON'T JUST JUMP ON THE FIRST ONE THAT COMES ALONG. JUMP ON THE FIRST ONE? WELL, DON'T JUMP OUT OF YOUR PANTS. THAT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION. [LAUGHING] JUST WAIT. YOU'LL GET A LOT OF HITS AND PROBABLY, I THINK YOU'VE GOT A GOOD PROFILE. AND THAT PROFILE, AGAIN IS REALLY CRITICAL. I THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK FOR YOU. WHAT'S A HIT? WHAT'S THAT MEAN? WELL, THAT MEANS THAT THEY'RE RESPONDING TO YOUR PROFILE. SOMEBODY'S LOOKING AT IT. OH, OKAY. I GOT IT. WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS CHECK YOUR E-MAILS EVERY DAY. AND LIKE I SAY, DON'T RESPOND TO THE FIRST ONE. YOU'LL GET A WHOLE BUNCH AND THEY'LL EVEN SEND PICTURES.

WELL, YEAH, IT USED TO -- THAT'S BECAUSE LIFE WAS A WHOLE LOT MORE SOCIAL BACK THEN. THAT'S RIGHT. I MEAN NOW IT'S, NOW IT'S NOT NEARLY SOCIAL AS IT USED TO BE. WELL, THAT HOW I, THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I NEVER MET ANY WOMEN, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I NEVER WENT TO CHURCH. WHEN I WAS IN THE SERVICE THAT'S THE FIRST PLACE I WENT WAS CHURCH ON WEEKENDS. BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD. THAT'S BECAUSE YOU WERE FEARFUL OF GOD OR BECAUSE -- NO, BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST PLACE TO MEET WOMEN! OH, OKAY. [LAUGHING] GOD HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. BELIEVE ME. [LAUGHING] THE DOW IS OFF 400 POINTS AND THEN BY THE END OF THE DAY, YOU KNOW, THEY RECOVER MOST OF IT, THEY'RE OFF BY 128 POINTS. YUP. SO IT'S LIKE THEY'RE GLAD THAT IT WAS ONLY 120 POINTS OFF.

IT'S UH, UH, THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT IS COVERED WITH, OVER A PERIOD OF TIME IT ACCUMULATES THINGS LIKE UH, CRUSTACEANS OF VARIOUS SORTS UH, BARNACLES AND SEA URCHINS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THAT ABOUT EVERY, OH, SEVEN, TEN YEARS. SEVEN YEARS I THINK WOULD BE BEST. IT'S BEEN OVER TEN YEARS SINCE I'VE DONE IT. SO, UH, I CAN SEE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS. IT'S KIND OF LIKE UH, IF IT WERE A CAR, IT'D BE CHANGING THE OIL EVERY, YOU KNOW, EVERY, EVERY 3,000 MILES. WELL, WITH A BOAT, YOU HAVE TO REMOVE THESE SEA URCHINS AND I HAVE TO GET DOWN THERE WITH MY SCUBA GEAR AND, AND UM, SCRAPE THE BOTTOM. IT'S NOT VERY MUCH FUN. SO ANYWAY...

DAMMIT! I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP! I KNOW WHETHER I GOT A RELATIONSHIP OR NOT. YOU DON'T KNOW A DAMN THING ABOUT IT, JESSE. ALL I KNOW IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. WELL, YEAH, BUT YOU'RE MISINTERPRETING. CRYSTAL'S ALWAYS TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER SOME SORT OF COCKTAIL PARTY OR GET TOGETHER SO I'LL TALK TO HER ABOUT IT. WHO KNOWS? GOOD. YOU DO THAT. I BET THAT WAS REALLY, THAT WOULD PROBABLY REALLY IMPRESSED CYNTHIA. YOU THINK THAT'D DO YOU SOME GOOD, HUH? YEAH, I THINK IT WOULD. ALRIGHT. ALRIGHT.

SO I'LL TALK TO HER BUT I'LL LET YOU KNOW. I MEAN, I SEE HER EVERY FEW DAYS, ANYWAY, SO. IN THE MEANTIME, TAKE HER -- BUY HER A HAMBURGER. TAKE HER TO A MOVIE. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING TO CYNTHIA TILL YOU KNOW. YEAH, EXACTLY. I DON'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT HER AND SAY, "YEAH, WE'RE GOING OVER TO DAVID'S PLACE" AND END UP TELLING HER, "NO, HIS WIFE DIDN'T WANT ME TO COME OVER THEIR PLACE." YOU KNOW, I'M A LITTLE BIT PARANOID ABOUT THOSE KIND OF THINGS. WELL, IT'S TRUE. UNCOMFORTABLE IN SOCIAL CIRCLES AND STUFF LIKE THAT, SO. I JUST DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, I TRY TO BE HONEST. BUT THERE'S A FINE LINE BETWEEN BEING HONEST AND, AND, UH, CONFESSING AND BRAGGING, FOR EXAMPLE. I DON'T WANT TO BE A BRAGGART. YOU KNOW. TALK ABOUT THE WOMEN, FOR GOD'S SAKES. I, I JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS STUFF. I JUST DON'T KNOW. YEAH. YEAH. I APPRECIATE THAT. YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF THINGS, BOB.

IT'S, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE BOOK IT ALL KIND OF TRACKS TO ME. WELL, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T WRITE THIS TO UH, REDEMPTION. I'M JUST TRYING TO BE HONEST AND TELL PEOPLE WHO I AM AND WHAT I'VE DONE AND MY, MY EDITOR SAID THAT'S WHERE THE VALUE IN THE STORY IS, IS IN THE HONESTY AND THAT GIVES A STORY INTEGRITY AND WHATNOT. SO, I JUST DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE. I, I, BOY, I JUST DON'T KNOW. WELL, AT LEAST YOU'VE GOT A STORY TO TELL. I MEAN, THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T. DELICATE AROMAS AND FLAVORS OF PEACH, PINEAPPLE, JASMINE, AND GINGER DELIVER A SLIGHTLY SPICY WINE. ENHANCED BY A SUBTLE FLORAL TONES AND APPEALING TOUCH OF EARTHINESS. THE FINISH IS LONG WITH LICORICE SPICE AND A TOUCH OF PEPPER. YOU KNOW, I THINK DAVID WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THIS. AND IT'S ONLY $5.99. I THINK YOUR FRIEND WOULD LOVE IT. LET ME GET IT. REALLY?

WELL, WE DO GO DOWN THERE AND VISIT FRIENDS AND STAY WITH FRIENDS. WE'RE, WE'RE... WE'RE LOOKING INTO BUYING OUR OWN PLACE DOWN THERE. KIND OF THINKING THROUGH THAT WHOLE SITUATION. ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT QUITE ACCURATE. IT'S ALREADY BEEN DECIDED. WE'D BE DOWN THERE NOW IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE FACT THAT DAVID HAS DECIDED TO CHAUFFEUR AROUND THIS LITTLE OLD MAN THAT HE MET AND FELT SORRY FOR, YOU KNOW, IN HIS GYM CLASS. DAVID IS THE KIND OF PERSON THAT LETS PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIM. YOU KNOW, THIS GUY HASN'T EVEN PAID FOR HIS GAS. IT'S A GOOD THING WE HAVE MONEY. EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES TO BOOKING AIRLINE TICKETS. THEN DAVID LIKES TO GET UP -- YOU KNOW, THEY ALWAYS SAY THE WEE HOURS ARE THE BEST FOR BOOKING ANYTHING -- AND HE GETS ON HIS LITTLE COMPUTER AND HE'S JUST GOTTA GO TO ALL THESE PLACES AND FIND THE ABSOLUTE, ROCK BOTTOM, CHEAPEST FARE. AND HE FOUND IT ON SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. BUT OF COURSE, THEY DON'T LEAVE FOR TWO WEEKS. SO, WE'RE STUCK HERE FOR A WHILE. SO, PALM SPRINGS. WHAT DO YOU DO DOWN THERE?

HE DIED 11 YEARS AGO. HE WAS QUITE SICK BUT I TOOK CARE OF HIM. I BET THAT WAS EXHAUSTING, HUH? WELL, YES. BUT THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU DO. HAVE YOU NOT EVER HAD SOMEONE SPECIAL? WELL, NOT, NOT THAT KIND OF SPECIAL. I'VE HAD PEOPLE. I MEAN, I'VE HAD RELATIONSHIPS. YEARS AGO I HAD A YOUNG LADY THAT WE WERE PRETTY CLOSE. I USED TO TAKE HER SAILING ALL THE TIME ON MY DAD'S BOAT. WELL, IT WAS MY DAD'S BOAT AT THAT TIME. AND LATER ON, HE GAVE ME THE BOAT AND UH, I NEEDED A PLACE TO LIVE AND IT HAD SOME SENTIMENTAL VALUE TO ME, TOO, AT THE TIME SO, THAT'S WHY I HAVE THE BOAT. YOU'VE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT MOVING? YEAH, I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT MOVING. I MEAN, IT'S, THAT'S ALWAYS AN OPTION BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, I'M PRETTY COMFORTABLE ON THE BOAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU DID TO YOUR BACK? WELL, I'M NOT, NOT SURE. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE WAY I SLEPT OR SOMETHING. OH, I THINK YOU NEED A REAL BED. NOT THAT OLD COT ON THAT OLD BOAT OF YOURS. I THINK I FEEL A LOT BETTER RIGHT NOW. WELL, YOU KNOW, THE MANUAL SAID I COULD USE THIS FOR 15 CONTINUOUS MINUTES. I THINK THAT'S -- OH, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO GO THAT LONG. I THINK I'M FULLY RECOVERED NOW. WELL, ARE YOU SURE? BECAUSE I HAVEN'T EVEN DONE YOUR LOWER BACK YET. OH GOD. - THANK YOU. - SURE. BRITT? I THINK YOU SHOULD SELL YOUR BOAT. SELL MY BOAT? I'VE BEEN GIVING IT SOME THOUGHT. AND I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH YOU. SELL MY BOAT. HMM. SURE. YOU CAN COME STAY WITH ME. I'M HUMBLED THAT YOU'VE ASKED ME. AND THIS, UH, THIS IS A BIG THING WITH ME, THIS THING WITH YOU AND THERE'S A LOT GO -- WE COULD START TOMORROW. WE COULD GET AN EARLY START, GET UP EARLY AND I COULD RENT A U-HAUL. YOU COULD DRIVE IT. I DON'T THINK I COULD DRIVE IT. BUT YOU COULD DRIVE THE U-HAUL. WE WOULD JUST BACK IT RIGHT UP TO YOUR BOAT. I THINK WE COULD GET EVERYTHING IN ONE LOAD AND WE'D BE DONE. WELL, I CAN'T DO IT TOMORROW. WHY? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [DUCK CALL QUACKING BADLY] [COUGHING] YOU KNOW, DAVE, I GOTTA TELL YOU, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE MUCH THROUGH THOSE BINOCULARS. I KNOW. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE KIND OF SUPERFLUOUS TO OUR PURPOSE HERE. YEAH, PRETTY NARROW FIELD OF VIEW. I THINK I'M BETTER OFF WITHOUT THEM ALMOST. [MUSIC] BOY! IT'S COLD OUT HERE. IT IS COLD, GODDAMMIT! GONNA HAVE A LITTLE WARM-UP HERE. - OH! - HEY, DAVE. I'M SORRY. THAT'S NOT ALLOWED. I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE BUT WE DON'T, WE DON'T DRINK WHEN WE'RE HUNTING. IT'S OKAY AFTERWARDS. YOU CAN GET SHITFACED IF YOU WANT. YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE'S MORE DUCKS AROUND MY BOAT THAN THERE ARE AROUND HERE. WE COULD GET TO CLUB THEM IN THE HEAD. I TOLD YOU IT'D BE TOUGH. JUST, YOU KNOW. I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN A DUCK SINCE WE GOT OUT HERE. I DON'T THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA. I DON'T THINK THOSE DECOYS ARE ARRANGED RIGHT, EITHER. I GOT SOME QUESTION ABOUT THAT, TOO. YOU REALIZE HOW RIDICULOUS THAT WOULD LOOK IF YOU WERE TO FLY OVER THEM? HOW A DUCK WOULD LOOK DOWN ON THOSE THINGS? YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. HUH? THE DECOYS ARE FINE. OH NO. I DON'T KNOW. THERE ARE NO DAMN DUCKS. WELL, I THINK THEY ARE A TREMENDOUS WASTE OF TIME. WELL, I TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE. THE ONLY DUCKS I'VE SEEN AROUND HERE ARE THOSE DAMN DECOYS. WHERE ARE MY GODDAMN WADERS? WHY DON'T WE JUST GET A CHICKEN AT COSTCO? MIGHTY DUCK HUNTER YOU ARE, FOR CHRIST SAKES. [MUSIC] HEY, YOU BEEN LAID YET? THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU, BRITT, FOR CHANGING YOUR LIFESTYLE. YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT YOU WAS STUCK AND GONNA BE AN ASSHOLE ALL YOUR LIFE AND BY GOLLY, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE REALLY COME 'ROUND. I'VE SEEN YOU WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND AND YOU LOOK REALLY GOOD. AND YOU'RE GOOD FOR HER. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE DOING FINE. I'M PROUD OF YOU. I REALLY AM. - YOU THINK SO? - YEAH! [MUSIC] SO, YOU'RE BACK ON SENIOR CONNECTIONS? NO, NO. NO, I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT. I'M DONE WITH THAT. WELL, WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO NEXT, THEN? DAVE! DAVE! YOU'RE NOT DOING ANY GOOD. COME ON, GET OUT OF THE GODDAMN WATER. AHH! AHH! YOU GOING TO LET ME READ THAT BOOK? NO. WHY NOT? I'M KIND OF LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING UH -- ARE YOU SICK OR SOMETHING? ARE YOU COMING DOWN WITH...? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S COLD, MAN! MY FEET ARE FREEZING. OH! [SNIFFING] [WHEEZY COUGHING] [BANG!] OHH. [COUNTRY MUSIC] [COUGHING CONTINUES] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUSIC CONTINUES] I KNOW WE POSSESS POWERFUL TOOLS FOR OUR SURVIVAL BUT FEW OF US REALIZE OUR VERY OWN POTENTIAL. AND THIS I BELIEVE, A GOOD LIFE IS ONE OF RISKS COUPLED WITH, WELL OF COURSE, CREATIVITY, LOVE, AND GIVING BACK WITHIN ONE'S CAPACITY TO DO SO. THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT REGRET IS THAT I DIDN'T LIVE UP TO THAT CODE. YET, MY LIFE HAS BEEN EXCEEDINGLY FULL AND BOUNTIFUL AND THAT HELPS ME KEEP TILTING TOWARDS WINDMILLS, ALL OF WHICH REMINDS ME OF A LANGSTON HUGHES POEM. IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES. 'TWO MEN LOOKED UP FROM THE PRISON BARS, ONE SAW MUD AND ONE SAW STARS.' IF I LEARNED ANYTHING OVER THESE MANY YEARS, IT IS THAT THE THRILL OF MY LIFE HAS BEEN MORE IN THE CHASE AND NOT SO MUCH IN THE CATCHING. I GUESS SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE. I JUST KEEP GOING AROUND AND AROUND. THAT WHICH WE ARE, WE ARE. COUGH! EXCUSE ME. SO, AT SOME POINT THIS RAMBLING NARRATIVE MUST END. AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ONE WHO WOULD RATHER JUMP BEFORE I'M PUSHED. SO FOR ME, IT'S SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. SO BE IT. [CHEERS] [APPLAUSE] YAY! [CHEERS] [APPLAUSE] YAY! OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE THOSE AIRLINES CHARGE $20 FOR EXTRA BAGGAGE. UH-HUH. YOU NEED SOME HELP? OH. THAT'D BE GREAT. THANKS. OH, YEAH. LET'S GET THAT CENTERED A LITTLE BIT. OH, SUPER. THERE YOU GO. HOW'D YOU DO THAT? THANK YOU, KIND SIR. YOU'RE WELCOME. I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE FUN. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE TRIP. ARE YOU SERIOUS? YEAH? OH, I'M REALLY HAPPY. THAT'S SO GREAT. I CAN'T WAIT. - IT'LL BE GREAT. - OH! IT'S WONDERFUL. SAY, I JUST HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM FOR A MINUTE 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO USE THOSE UGLY LAVATORIES ON THE PLANE. OKAY, OKAY. HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE? OH, 15 OR 20 MINUTES. OKAY. [SOFT JAZZY MUSIC] [SOFT JAZZY MUSIC] [BREAKING GLASS] WHAT WAS THAT? DID SOMETHING BREAK? OH, I BUMPED THE VASE WITH THE CLUB. NOTHING SERIOUS. - OH. - JUST BROKE IT. OKAY. LET ME GET THE VACUUM. OKAY. PUT ON SOME SHOES. I DON'T WANT YOU TO CUT YOUR FEET. YEAH, THANKS. E. COLI IS EVERYWHERE. - E. COLI? - YEAH! YOU NOTICE ONLY THE PEOPLE THAT DIE FROM E. COLI ARE KIND OF SICKLY PEOPLE ANYWAY. IF YOU'RE GOOD AND STRONG AND HEALTHY, YOU CAN EAT A RARE HAMBURGER. IT'S NOT GOING TO KILL YOU. [CHATTER] IT'S A MATTER OF LIABILITY IF YOU DON'T COOK HAMBURGER SAFELY FOR THE PUBLIC. IT HAS TO BE HEATED TO AT LEAST 145 DEGREES. [CHATTER] YOU ONLY BRING GRIFFEY IN AND YOU LOOK AT IT. YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH YOU'RE PAYING AND YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH YOU'RE BRINGING TO THE STANDS -- HOLY SHIT!... OH, SHIT! I CAN'T SEE A DAMN THING NOW. WHERE'S A LIGHT WHEN I NEED ONE. [CELL PHONE RINGTONE] OH, DAMN TELEPHONE. WHO'S THERE? GIVE ME A SECOND HERE. I WANT TO GET THE LIGHTS BACK ON. [CRASH!] OH, HEY! I JUST PUT SOME BREAD IN THE TOASTER AND IT SHORTED OUT AND BLEW THE BREAKER. SORRY, I GUESS MY PHONE WAS ON A VIBRATE. GODDAMN IT. I WAS MAKING MYSELF A PIECE OF TOAST. WELL, YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO HAVE FOR DINNER. NO, I'LL PUT SOME, I'LL PUT SOME BUTTER AND JAM ON IT. I THINK -- I KIND OF LIKE THAT. BUT, UH, PROBABLY THE LAST PIECE OF TOAST I HAVE TONIGHT BECAUSE THE TOASTER BROKE. WELL, I KNOW I SHOULD EAT SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN THAT BUT I'M TIRED AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO -- I UNDERSTAND. YEAH... OH, YOU MEAN TONIGHT? WELL. I'M PRETTY TIRED, YOU KNOW. CAN'T WE DO THAT IN THE MORNING? HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE OR SOMETHING? I AM KIND OF TIRED AND I DON'T SEE WELL AT NIGHT. FOR THAT MATTER, I COULD GO TO SLEEP AND RUN OFF THE ROAD. YEAH. YEAH. OKAY. WELL, THANK YOU. GOODNIGHT! WELL, I KNOW I'D SAID I'D BE EARLY. AND I KNOW I TOLD YOU I'M AN EARLY RISER BUT I NEEDED SOME MORE SLEEP, I GUESS. WELL, LISTEN, I GOT SOME -- WHY DON'T I PACK A FEW BOXES AND PUT THEM IN MY PICKUP AND WHEN I COME OVER WE'LL AT LEAST HAVE SOME OF THAT STUFF TAKEN CARE OF. WELL -- [GRUNTS] -- WHY DON'T I DO THAT ANYWAY? OKAY? I KNOW THAT WE'LL GET OUR DAYS GOING JUST A LITTLE LATER BUT WE'LL, WE'LL MOVE REAL FAST, I PROMISE. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. I, YEAH, I HAD A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP. YES. I LIKE SLEEPING HERE. WELL, I LIKE SLEEPING AT YOUR PLACE, TOO. BUT THIS, I MEAN, NO, OLD HABITS... ALRIGHT. WELL. SORRY I'M SO LATE. BYE. SHIT. [BLEEP!] HELLO, FROM PALM SPRINGS WHERE I'M THE PROUD NEW OWNER OF A CONDO IN THE COMMUNITY OF IRONWOOD. I'VE ATTACHED SOME PHOTOS. CHRIS HAS BEEN WORKING ON THE INTERIOR DESIGN WHILE I HIT THE GOLF COURSE WITH MY FRIEND, DOUG CARLSON. IT'S NOT BAD HERE AT ALL. THE WEATHER IS VERY PLEASANT AND THERE ARE LOTS OF SOCIAL GATHERINGS AND EVENTS THAT KEEP US BUSY. WE'VE JUST MET SOME WONDERFUL PEOPLE HERE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. WE DECIDED NOT TO TAKE THE BAJA CRUISE THIS YEAR. CHRIS HAS DECIDED WE'RE GOING TO PARIS INSTEAD. SO I'M NOT SURE WHEN I'LL BE HOME. PROBABLY SOMETIME IN THE SUMMER. UNTIL THEN, KEEP DRY UP THERE.

WELL, SHE TAUGHT ME THIS PHRASE 'MUY CALIENTE' WHICH MEANS HOTTER THAN HELL. [CHUCKLES] MAYBE THAT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH EXCITEMENT FOR A MAN OF YOUR SENIORITY. HEY, I CAN HANDLE IT, BUDDY. DON'T YOU FORGET THAT. ALRIGHT. LET'S GET GOING, THEN. [LAUGHING] ONWARD AND UPWARD. [LIGHT-HEARTED MUSIC] BARTENDER SAYS, "SO, DIDN'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING IN YOUR HAND?" HE SAID, "YEAH," HE SAID.
