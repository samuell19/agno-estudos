[somber music] Mister Murray, please don't take this the wrong way, but you pay me $150 twice a week to keep you company. Although I greatly appreciate the generosity, I'd like to try to assist you with your troubles. You have to open up at some point, Isaac. I can't do my job if you don't speak to me. Isaac, I know you've been through an enormous amount of trauma, but I can help you. At least, I can try if given the opportunity. Isaac. Isaac. (ON RADIO) Anybody that wants to comment on the situation can call in to the station at 450-789-9600. Again, that's 450-789-9600. We want to hear from the people. Tell us your name or where are you calling from. (ON RADIO) I'm Jennifer, calling in from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (ON RADIO) What's up, Jennifer? What's your thoughts on this whole thing? (ON RADIO) Listen, look, I feel like someone is lying. I feel it in my bones. And my intuition, it's always right. [gravel crunching] [dog barking] Baby, who was that? You're crazy. Don't start that. [huff] Why are you going on about my phone? (WHISPERING) Hey, baby, I think that's him right there. Yeah, I think so. I heard he's been doing a lot of weird, crazy shit. Yeah, I heard that too. Yeah, you know what? Let's just go. Come on. Weirdo. Babe. Babe. [eerie sounds] [indistinct voices muttering] [panting] Isaac. Isaac. Hey, baby girl. Sandra, you heard your father. I'm about to go hang out with a few friends, Mom. I'll be back soon. Sandra. You know it's your fault that she hates me, right? My fault? Yes, your fault. Isaac, Sandra has a mind of her own. And you know why she's acting that way. You know she does not hate you. She's just hurt. Well, Alex, I'm trying. I just get so angry. And the pills don't seem to be working. [doorbell chiming] Are you expect the company? No. Are you? [door creaking] Hey, these are for you. And you said you have no idea what this card could be about. Well, like I said, I've never had a conversation with the Johnsons prior to today. I asked my wife about it, but she didn't understand the card either. Your wife? Speaking of Alexandra, this wouldn't happen to belong to her? Don't you ever fucking touch these again. You know, Isaac, we haven't spoke about your wife that much recently. I'm sorry. You know Alexandra and I haven't been in the best space as of late. No? I haven't been the best husband as of late. I mean, I'm trying. I swear, I'm trying. I put the bottle down close to a year ago. And so what seems to be the problem? [melodic music] Can I tell you a story? OK. It was cold, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It's about 7:30 or 8:00. I remember because the game was about to come on-- Packers versus Bears at Lambeau Field. These rivalries in football dating back to the '20s. Rookie wide receiver, Ken Margerum, played for the best. Ball slipped right through his hands. [huff] It's a 23-yard line. Packers picked it off, stopping the Bears' scoring drive. November 15, 1981. Packers won 21-17. Big fan of the Packers, I see. Oh, no, no, no, no. My father was a big Bears fan. One of the biggest Bears fans you'd want to meet. Yeah, we moved to Chicago from Gulfport, Mississippi in the late '70s. My parents were seeking work in the steel industry. Anyway, that night my father met a man named Gerald. Mister G is what we called him. [chuckle] Alexandra's father-- one of the nicest men walking god's green Earth. They stayed three houses down in a light blue house on the corner. It was over 40 years ago. Anyway, November 16, 1981, that's when I met the love of my life. You sound like you really enjoyed telling that story. What happened? I've got to go. Alexander's making my favorite meal tonight. I've got to get going. But Isaac-- Yeah? Never mind. [mysterious music] (ON RADIO) It's been over 20 years since something like this has happened. Such a small loving community. This type of thing doesn't happen around here often. (ON RADIO) So Kelly, what's the atmosphere been like since all of this has taken place? (ON RADIO) Look, George, I'll be honest. It's created a sense of fear and concern throughout the community. Hey, babe, I'm home. Jeff. Something smells good. What are you making? I had my headphones in. I didn't know you were home. I said something smells good. So how was work? I had six patients today, including my special case. I think we're slowly starting to make a connection. I think he's beginning to open up. Really? What makes you say that? I got a childhood memory. It's been two months and finally a breakthrough. Usually he says nothing, so I hope we can stay on this path of communication. Well, I hope so too. You've been trying to get through to that guy for a while now. Yeah, I know. Hopefully it all works out. Thanks, babe. [music continues] [knocking] Sandra, It's time to wake up. It's time for you to go to work. [knocking] Sandra. Come on, now. You've got to get up. You've got to be more responsible. You've got to get out and do things on your own. You're an adult now. Sandra. You know what? Forget it. If you get fired, you just get fired. I don't care. Good morning, babe. I see you're not answering my calls. I just want to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry about last night, raising my voice at you. And that's my fault. I need you to understand that I'm trying. I really am. I understand if you need a breather. Probably at Pam's house. I hope you come home this evening because we really need to talk this out. And can you please talk to Sandra? She's ignoring me. And I'm not feeling that, so you just talk to it for me, please. I hope to see you this evening. I love you. Isaac. Isaac. Yes? Where'd you go? What do you mean? You drew a complete blank mid-conversation. I don't know what you're talking about. I asked you if you wanted to finish your conversation from yesterday. You were talking to me about your wife and her father. This is a safe space. I can help you. If you don't want to talk about that, we can talk about anything that you want. I don't know how to get through to my daughter. She's very upset with me. She won't even talk to me. Why is she upset? She's upset because how I used to be. What did you used to be? An alcoholic. How long were you an alcoholic? Too many years to count. Too many. Do you remember what made you start drinking? I used to hear voices in my head. They used to tell me to do things, and I didn't want to hear it. When I was a teenager, I started drinking, and drinking would calm the voices. I just didn't want to hear it. You know what I'm saying? Of course. I understand. A lot of people start taking drugs and alcohol because of mental illness. So did you ever get help? Oh, no, no, no, no. If I had went and got help, that would be me admitting that something was wrong with me. My mama used to tell me, boy, there's nothing wrong with you. That's just god talking to you. Yeah. So what made you stop drinking? I stopped for her, my Sandra. I mean, I missed so much of her life. I don't even remember much of her childhood. I-- [stammering] I've got to-- No, Isaac, stay in the moment. Let it out. You said, I don't remember much of her childhood. I-- I just wish I had been a better father. I wish we could have had that bond, you know? And she's grown now. I can't tell her nothing. I just wish things would have been different. [stammering] I've got to go. Alex doesn't like it if I'm late for dinner. And I might have been a drunk, but in 20 years I have never been late for dinner. [MUSIC - ANTHONY LAZARO, "MILLE INCENDI"] Hey, babe. Just checking to see if you left Pam's house yet. I'm on my way home for dinner. Actually I'm going to be a little early today. You know what? I think I'm taking you out to dinner tonight. Yeah. Sandra's just going to have to fend for herself. [chuckle] All right, I'm on my way over to Pam's house. See you soon. Love you. [music gets louder] [knocking] Hey, Pam, is Alexandra here? You've got some nerve coming around here. I'm sorry I didn't call first, but can I come in? Hell, no, you can't come in my house. Get off my property. [eerie music] Why is it every time me and your sister get into it, you've got to involve yourself ? Pam, why can't you just stay neutral? Get the fuck off my property. You're just walking around here like you got it all together. You've got all these people fooled. But see, I know the real you. Now as I said before, get the fuck off my property. Hey, Isaac, do me a favor. Don't ever show your face around here again. I think I'm going to give him my number. You're going to give who your number? The guy from work. What is his name, child? Come one, his name doesn't even matter. Hey. I thought you was still over Pam's house. No, I left this morning. Go ahead, sit down. I've already got your plate ready. Well, why didn't you answer the phone when I called or return my voicemails? I just was trying to get over it. So how was your day, Sandra? I said, how was your day, Sandra? Sandra, don't you hear your father talking to you? Yes, Mom. My day was fine. Did you make it to work on time? Because I came by your bedroom, but you didn't answer the door. I am a grown woman, OK? I don't need you waking me up to go to work. [cutlery rattling against plate] [thud] Oooh. [laugh] Yeah. Yeah, that's it. That's the father I know. Hm-mm. But you know what, Isaac? I'm not scared of you. I'm not like my mom. [indistinct voices muttering] [panting] Isaac. Isaac. Baby. Hey, baby. Isaac, it's OK. It's OK. Come on, come on. Breathe. Isaac, come on. Come on. Yeah, you're OK. You're OK. Where's your pills, baby? Your pills. Where's your pills? [rattling] (WHISPERING) It's OK. [grunt] OK, it's all right. (WHISPERING) It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Are you all right? OK. Do you see what you've even done? Your father is sick. Why can't you just stop it? Me, stop it? I didn't even do anything to him. You know what? He brought all of this on himself. [thud] [inaudible] [clanging] And what was that supposed to mean? What? That you're not like me. Mom, you know what it means, OK? You know what? I'm just going to go over one of my friends house or something. I can't even have dinner with you all. It's just like so much, all the time. [thud] Sandra Renee. Yes. Now if you're going to continue to live in this house, you're going to show your father and me some respect. Do I make myself clear? Do I? Yes, ma'am. [sighing] (ON RECORDING) Anyway, that night father met a man named Gerald. Mister G is what we called him. Alexandra's father-- One of the nicest men walking god's green Earth. What are you doing? (ON RECORDING) They stayed three houses down-- Just going over a few things for my session tomorrow. (ON RECORDING) It was over 40 years ago. It's like 3:00 AM. Would you put that stuff off and get some rest? Don't you have to be at the office at like 9:00? Yeah, I will in a few. (SIGHING) You said you wouldn't bring home work, and now there's files on the bed. Yeah, I know. After I read these last couple of pages, I'll put it away. No work in the bedroom. I'm sorry. What's he got going on over there? I don't know. What's that in his hand? Looks like a trash bag. That boy sure is weird. Hm-mm. [bird chirping] [tapping] Babe. Yes? The neighbors are acting weird again. Which ones? The crazy lady next door and that couple down two houses down. Something's seriously wrong with them, for real. Every time I speak, they look like they want to take off running and run away from me or something. What? I haven't did nothing to them. But you know what we need to do? The next time they try to approach us, we need to take off running on their ass. [laughing] See how they feel about that. You know what I'm saying? Oh, you're so silly. Um-hm. I'm about to get ready for my appointment, all right? All righty. All right. (ON RADIO) So the big question is, as a woman, do you still feel safe in our little, quiet town following the disappearance of those two ladies? Going to go to the phone line right now. Caller, what's your name? (ON RADIO - VOICE DISTORTED) This is Tanya. (ON RADIO) So Tanya, do you feel safe as a woman, knowing two women are missing? (ON RADIO - VOICE DISTORTED) No, I'm scared. Things like this never happens here. I've been locking my doors, and I even have an alarm system now. (ON RADIO) An alarm system? [MUSIC - SEMO & BEL AMI, "BETTER"] (LYRICS) In the faith that you can achieve what's inside your soul. Someday we'll make it on by. Upstage we only can try. Either way, no matter what people say, either way we're going to get-- Some day we'll make it on by-- So when he yells at me, I just get up so upset, I just end up crying in the ladies room. So what I need from you is to help me not feel anything, so I can focus and get my job done. Have you ever thought about leaving this job? No, I can't leave this job. I've spent years in school and working with kids. I can't just leave this job. Well, our time is up for today. So let's revisit this next week. OK. Look who's early? That's always a great start. Come on in, Isaac. Thank you, thank you. OK, so how are you today? I'm doing great today, doc. That's great. What happened today that has you in such a good mood? My neighbors are being so weird. I mean-- [chuckle] And it gave Alex and I a good laugh this morning. What happened with the neighbors? It's funny. Any time I'm around, they get in a small huddle. And I'm already knowing they're talking about me. It's-- I don't know. It's-- and then when I try to speak back, they don't speak. If I try to approach them, they walk away like they're scared or something. I don't know. Why do you think they behave in this manner? I don't know. I've never done anything to them. Come to think about it, all my neighbors act this way, or they're bringing me a plate of food and-- [chuckle] --and saying they're sorry. And then they walk away. Why do you think they all behave like this? Honestly, doc, I don't know. What does Alexander think of the neighbors' behavior? Well, I mean, she doesn't know why they treat me that way. How do they treat her? Alexandra, she doesn't talk to the neighbors much. As a matter of fact, I haven't seen Alexandra communicate with the neighbors much at all. Do you think they could have overheard some arguments between the two of you? I don't know. I mean, they are a bit nosy. But maybe on one of those drunken nights, I suppose. Maybe on a drunken night. Do you remember any of those drunken nights? No, not really. I mean, I used to get hammered all day from sunup to sundown daily. What type of drunk were you? What do you mean? Were you a funny drunk, sleepy drunk, horny drunk, an angry drunk, or were you a violent drunk? I was a angry, violent drunk. I hurt her before. Who did you hurt? Alex. I hit her. I mean, only when I was intoxicated, but still. I put her in the hospital. And still, she stood by my side. I mean, she said she knew I had a disease. But she was always there. I owe it to her-- I owe it to them-- to get myself together, yeah just to be a better person. But yeah. What did you do to them? What did I do to who? You said you owed it to them in the past tense. No, I mean, I owe them, like present and future. Yeah, I owe them the world. I mean, they see me at my worst. I can be better, though. How will you be better? I'll take my meds and stay sober and be there and be present for my girls. That's great, Isaac. That really is. But I want to dig a little deeper, though. OK. I want to go back to my initial question. What did you do to them? What did I do to who? Where are they now? Where is who? Isaac, I need you to sit and calm down. Did you take your medicine today? Yes. Yes, yes. But doc, what's going on? I don't know what you're talking about. I see you're not ready for this just yet. And our time is up, so I want you to think about some of the things that you did when you were drunk. If you have a memory, write it down, and we can discuss it. Listen, I need to know what's going on here. What did I do to who? What-- did I hurt somebody? What happened? You are completely correct, Isaac. I apologize if my questions made you feel uncomfortable. That was not my intention. I'm sorry. We can reconvene later this week. [somber music] Hey, babe. You're looking good with all that yellow on. [alexandra laughing] My little bumblebee. Um-hm. Well, I tried to get you that rotisserie chicken. [rustling] But they were out, of course. But I got you the next best thing. What's wrong? Babe, it's-- psychiatrist said something that has me a little discombobulated. What did she say? She asked, where are they, and what did I do to them? I have no clue what she's talking about. Where, what you did to who? That's what I'm saying. I don't know what she's talking about. OK, we're not going to let that bother you. Maybe she just wanted you to open up about your past. I'm not talking about my past. Hey, sometimes they ask you a lot of questions. Um-um. Lots of questions-- Mm. --that don't make sense. Mm. Then they put it all together. [laughing] See, that's what I'm talking about. That's why I love you, because you know how to quiet that storm inside of me. Ooh, OK. [laughing] [tense music] Isaac-- Oh, hell, no. What the hell? That's what I'm-- Isaac. --talking about. (YELLING) What the fuck are y'all doing, huh? Isaac-- (YELLING) You're always talking shit. No, no, I'm tired of this shit. Come home. (YELLING) I'm tired of this shit. Oh, you're recording? Oh, you're recording, huh? You're recording? Record this. Please, Isaac-- (YELLING) Record this. Oh, y'all recording too? Baby, baby-- (YELLING) Y'all, get that fucking-- [interposing voices] (YELLING) Keep walking straight. You know what I'm saying? Oh, y'all want some of this? Isaac-- (YELLING) Y'all want some of this? Huh? Y'all want some of this? Isaac-- (YELLING) No. Fuck that. I'm tired of this shit. I'm tired of it. I'm tired. I'm tired of-- [screaming] [indistinct voices muttering] Listen. Listen to me. Listen. Listen. Listen. Breathe. I need you to breathe. I need you to breathe, baby. I need you to breathe. I'm here. I'm here. [inaudible] I'm here, baby. It's OK. Look at me. Breathe for me. Breathe for me, OK? Just concentrate on me. Concentrate on me. Concentrate. Concentrate. I'm here. I've got you. It's OK. Breathe. Come on. Let's go. Susan, what is this? Look at this. There were no witnesses. The ladies disappeared from the house. I thought you said you weren't going to bring work home. But technically this isn't work. You're right. This is police work you're doing here. Susie, you're not a detective. You're a psychiatrist. I know, but I think I found a clue. They interviewed the husband-- I don't care about that shit. I don't care at all. This is our time. You already work all day, so this is supposed to be our time. Babe, he said-- You are in way too deep, and I think you need help at this point. Look, leave this to the police, and get this shit out of my house. Babe, I've made a breakthrough. I don't care, Susie, and neither should you. Don't let this affect our marriage. You're barely getting any sleep, and this is all you've been thinking about. You're way too involved, and you're completely out of character. Please, just give this case to someone else. I know. You're right. I got some information today, and I started piecing together this puzzle. I shouldn't have brought work home. But I'm not getting on my case. I have worked entirely too hard. I've built a sense of trust. I can't just stop. I can't just stop now. Then it would have been all for nothing. I am almost there. I can do this. I will do this. Whatever, Susan. Like I said, get this shit out of my house, and leave it to the police. [suspenseful music] (SLURRING) Baby-- Don't even touch me. You're relaxed? I'm sick of this shit. Baby, it was a one-time-- I'm not doing this no more with you, Isaac. It was a one-time thing. It won't-- Really? --happen again. I promise it won't. No. Me and Sandra deserve better than this. You promised the last time was the last time. I'm not doing this no more with you. Not doing what? [drawer opening] This marriage. I'm leaving you. [drawer slamming shut] We're going to stay with my sister. Now where do you think you're going, huh? I'm leaving. Do you think I'm going to keep doing this? I cannot take it anymore. [packing sounds] Baby, baby, [inaudible] you not leaving me. [zippers closing] I already know too much, and this life is too short. And I refuse to go through this shit again with you. I'm tired. I'm tired, Isaac. Baby, you can't do me this way. Come on. I'm serious. Baby, please, don't do this What are you doing? Come here. You're not leaving me. Isaac, what are you-- get your hands off of me. [sinister music] You are not leaving me. You-- (WEEPING) Isaac-- --are not-- (WEEPING) Isaac, please. Isaac. [slapping] --leaving me. [choking sounds] You are not leaving me. [gasp] [panting] Isaac. Isaac, relax, Breathe. Breathe. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK, baby. It's OK. It's OK It's OK. [deep breathing] It was just a dream. It was just a dream. It was just a dream. Doc, I've been having the same nightmare for about a week. What happens in the nightmare? The nightmare is about Alex. So what is happening with Alex in this nightmare? Doc, I need you to understand. I love my wife. You understand? I might have been a shitty husband, but I love my wife. Isaac, this is a safe space. Let me help you. I know you love your wife. I had a dream that I hurt Alex. I hurt her really bad. You mean physically? Yes. Do you think this could be a memory from your past? No, no, no, no, it couldn't be. You did tell me that you've hurt her before. Did you ever think that that was OK? A man is never to hit a woman. In those moments, I was less than a man. You understand? So how does the dream end? I don't know. I usually wake up. So this is affecting your sleep. Yes, I'm scared to go to sleep. I don't want to see that. I'm going to write you a prescription for Ambien five milligrams. No, doc. I'm just going to stay awake. Isaac, you need to get some sleep. Staying awake for days is bad for your mental health. It's a very low dosage. I don't know, doc. I'm fine. I just won't go to sleep. I'm just going to stay awake. You need to finish the dream. You need to know what happens, see how it ends, see it through. OK, I'll try if you think it's best. Write it down. We'll discuss it next session. All right. I've got to go. I know. You don't want to be late for dinner. [tense music] (ON RADIO) So they're saying that these ladies disappeared from their home. There was no blood splatter or evidence of forced entry. The husband wasn't at home. He said he went out for some food. How has this man not a suspect? Isn't the husband the first person-- Wait. Turn that back on. The radio? Yes, hurry up. (ON RADIO) So let me know how y'all feel about him. Call in at 866-474-3849. Damn it. I missed it. Leave it to the police, Susie. Do not get involved. [melodic music] Yeah. [laugh] Hey, there, my Sandy Bear. Sandy Bear. I haven't heard that in a long time. Well, sit down. Check it out. It's your favorite show, right? Oh, yeah, it is. Um-hm. That's great. I didn't say you could have no popcorn. Thank you, Dad. Oh. Listen, I hate to tell you the last ending, but-- Don't tell me the ending. The maid dies. [sighing] [laughing] I'm sorry. I had to tell somebody. I thought it was this-- what is it? Brad? Yeah, Brad. I thought it was Brad. He's not even the killer. OK, I won't say anymore. I'm just saying. I don't believe you, but you know. You can still watch. Yeah, I'm going to watch. It's pretty good. Who made this popcorn? Hm? You made this? I did. [sinister music] Get off of her. Get off of my mom. What is wrong with you? Mama. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Don't go. [inaudible] [muffled screams] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [weeping] [gasp] [heavy breathing] [phone ringing] Isaac? Is everything OK, Isaac? Isaac, what's wrong? Where are you, Isaac? 5793 West Xavier Street. I can be there in 20 minutes. Meet me there. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Where do you think you're going? I can't argue with you right now, Jeff. Hey. Hey, look, the things that they're saying about this guy on the radio, the grocery store, the shopping centers, the news-- It's just all rumors and hearsay. You don't see what's going on? He's dangerous. There's no proof. I have to get to the bottom of what's going on. Well, I'm coming with you. No, you can't. Well, why the hell not? Because I'm the only one that he trusts. If you come, then he'll just shut down. And I'll never get him to talk. I have to go alone. Oh, this can't be happening. This can't be fucking happening. Baby, it's OK. It's OK. I promise. I'll be back soon, OK? I'll call you. No. [eerie music] [indistinct voices muttering] No, no. [scream] [muttering] No, no, no-- Isaac. No, no. Isaac, it's me. It's Susan. Isaac, talk to me. Am I crazy, doc? No, you're not crazy. What's going on, Isaac? I had the dream again. This time, it was worse. Doc, I hurt Sandra. OK. She wasn't moving. I don't know what happened. Something was wrong. She wasn't moving, doc. She wasn't moving, doc. I don't know what was wrong. She wasn't moving. She wasn't breathing, either, doc. Isaac, did you take your medicine today? I'm not crazy, right? I'm not crazy. Did you take your pills? No, no, no, doc. Don't go. No-- No, it was a nightmare. Please tell me it was a nightmare, doc. [tires screeching] (HYSTERICALLY) Please tell me it was a nightmare, doc. Please tell me-- [scream] Hey, get fuck away from my wife. (WEEPING) I was so scared.

That's what it is. I'm tripping. I'm tripping. Yeah. All right. [somber music intensifies] Yeah. Um-hm. OK. OK, I'll try to be home early today. OK. Let me call you back. Isaac, what's wrong? And why didn't you call before you stopped by? I know I don't have an appointment, but I just had to talk to somebody. OK, first, Isaac, I want to apologize for yesterday. It was very unprofessional of me to have met you after hours in a parking lot. What are you talking about? I didn't meet up with you last night. You don't remember driving to a parking lot last night and talking to me about your nightmare? No, last night I was with my wife. I had dinner with my wife, and then we went to bed. I don't have a clue of what you're talking about. OK, Isaac, so what brings you in today? I was listening to the radio. They said something on the radio, and it just can't be true. You've got to tell me that this can't be true. What did you hear on the radio? They said that my wife and my daughter are missing. And I just had dinner with my wife last night. So they can't be missing. I don't know what's going on. Can you please tell me what's going on? Isaac, can you please take a seat? No, no, no, you need to tell me what's going on now. OK, Isaac, I will tell you everything that you need to know. But I need you to sit down and take your medicine. [rattling] All right, doc, please tell me what's going on. Isaac, you've been coming to see me for two months now. You've been in denial about your wife and daughter's disappearance. No, that's not-- Isaac, please remain seated. Isaac, I believe you've suppressed your feelings and emotions. You've had an emotional breakdown. Your subconscious wants you to forget about the trauma that you've endured, hence why you still see them. But Isaac, they aren't there. You don't have any recollection about going to the police station, being questioned about their disappearance? No. You had to stay in a hotel for a week for forensics to look over your house for clues. You don't remember this? No. Isaac, you're the one who reported them missing. Here, read this. That's what I've been doing in these sessions-- trying to help you remember, trying to bring you back to reality, if you will. Doc, am I crazy? No, not at all, Isaac. Everyone deals with things differently. You're just in denial about what's really going on. OK, OK, OK. I'm not crazy. Isaac, I think you're experiencing DRC, Dream Reality Confusion. You can't determine whether this nightmare is just a dream or if it was a reality, whether your short-term memory is processing information into your long-term memory. What? I think your dream is your memory coming back. No, no, no, no, no-- Have a seat. I want you to try an exercise with me. Doc, I just-- Yeah? It's my family. That's OK. That's right. Relax. Close your eyes. That's right, Isaac. Try to remember and think. [eerie music] That's right, Isaac. Relax. Alex and Sandra want you to remember. They want to speak to you again. [panting] [indistinct voices muttering] [yelling] [panting] [beeping] [gasping] I did it. It was an accident. I didn't mean to do it. What was an accident, Isaac? What didn't you mean to do? I murdered my family. I left them in a ditch all alone. Isaac. Isaac. [sinister music] Come on, baby. Say the grace. Dear Lord, we thank you for this family, and we thank you for this food. We ask that you bless those that prepared it for us to give us the nutrition and nourishment that we need for our bodies. In your son Jesus's name, we bless his food. Amen. Amen.
