Hi, this is Happy Bob on a rainy Saturday night in Los Angeles. The weatherman says there'll be heavy showers off and on, tapering off into light drizzles by morning. If you plan on going out tonight, better take an umbrella. For those night owls who plan on sticking around for the next four hours we'll be talking about disasters, man-made or otherwise. First caller is Vicki. Hello, Vicki. You're on the air. Name your disaster. VICKI: Hi, Bob. Rain forests. You know, I'm concerned about the developers destroying our rain forests. I'd just rather not go about knowing they're cutting down the forests. [INAUDIBLE] BOB: I know what you're saying.

What did you think of that, Jose? "I thought it was fabulous." Okay, hey, how about a history lesson, huh? Let's name some famous latin Americans, huh? Okay, there was Cheech.

RECEPTIONIST: Really, Mr. Steiner, I'm doing my best. I talked to the delivery service twice already. Why don't you leave the package. Relax in the bar. I let you know when they make the drop. No. [SIGHS] I mean, no, thank you. I'm gonna hold onto the package until they come, and I'm waiting right here. Yes, sir. Can I help you? Yeah. Jack Hazard. I have a reservation.

I like it. I'll take it from here. Hey. Welcome back, Lloyd. How was your trip? It wasn't San Carlos. I'll tell you that. God, I love this place. [EXHALES] It holds a certain indescribable charm for me. Construction is going very well. [CHUCKLES] We're a week ahead of schedule. And how's the marketing program? Booked solid for the next season. I project 7,000 advance reservations. Whoo. You're solving all my problems. Except for a few small details. The local drivers are still afraid to use the road your company cut through the jungle. So, it's forced us to ship supplies in by boat. But, with the deal I made, it's cheaper than using the road and no maintenance. What deal? You made a deal? Mm-hmm.[CHUCKLES] You know, before you came here, these people were a nightmare to deal with. I mean, still they won't use the road. Superstitious, huh? Yes, well, the locals believe that spirits protect the jungle. Shadow people. Ooh. Nobody's ever seen one. I am going to introduce civilization to this place. Well, superstition and myth do predominate here. We'll have dinner tonight and catch up. Mm-hmm. Of course. I'll send a car for you. We might have a slight problem. Somebody's been doing a little computer hacking, but I think we know who it is. Let's find him. Hi. Great place, huh? I love the beach. [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] Wind surfing. We met this morning when you were checking in. I mean, I-I saw you checking in this morning. You don't mind if I sit down, right? Listen, uh, I saw, I saw your badge when you were checking in, and I want... How are we doing here? Can I get you anything else? Just the check, please. So, uh, I saw your badge when you were checking in. I know you're a police officer, okay? Listen, I need help. I'm in real trouble. Okay? I need to talk to a cop. Why don't you go find one? But, I saw your badge. A lot of people carry badges, building inspectors... Anyways, I need to speak to somebody. I mean, You might know cops, right? Listen, people are trying to kill me. Whoa. I don't want to hear that. Go away. I'm on vacation. I know you're on vacation here, but can't you at least tell me what I'm supposed to do? Listen, if you need help, call the local authorities. I did that already. Good. What's the problem then? They didn't do anything. [PANTING] Hey, I got to get help from somebody. Yeah, you do. There must be a hundred people trying to kill me. [GRUNTING] [PUNCHES] Oh, my hand! [SCOFFS] [GROANS] Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. What, what happened? Where did he go? He's gone. He went downstairs. Where's your room? This way.Are you sure? [MUTTERING]Come on. Listen, you'd better leave town. Now. That's what I'm going to do. I'm gonna leave town. Good. You've caused me enough trouble. What I'm saying is, thank you very much for helping me out back there. You just really, really saved my butt, and I know that. I, um, owe you. And I know I owe you. Um, anything you want. You say it, and I'm here for you. Jesus, I'm dead. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Ese es el hombre. Oh, shit. He's a cop. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Agarranlo. Listen, guys. I can explain. Let go. HAZARD: Hold it. Wait a second. Ah, screw it. STEINER: Water. Not the water. You guys are making a mistake. This is a big mistake. See how you like it. Hey, man, this is a mistake. I didn't know you were a cop, really. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that one, either. You don't speak English, do you? [SPEAKS SPANISH] Uno momento? How do you like that? Come on. We got to go. I think this is his. [GRUNTS] [LAUGHS] Yes, I speak English. Get him out of here. [SPEAKS SPANISH] [TELEPHONE RINGS] Yes. We got Steiner. The disk was in his bag. What about his friend? Did you find anything out about him? No. But he handles himself pretty well. He may know something. He was seen talking to Steiner. See what you can find out from Steiner and add his friend's name to the list for tomorrow. For the escape? You got it. [COUGHS] Jack, are you okay? Jack? Yeah. [GROANS] All right. Better tell me what this is all about. I tried. Try again. Well, see, I'm an accountant for this guy Lloyd Wheeler. I'm also into fooling around with computers. One day, I tied into his mainline system, found files that were under a security code. So I spent my spare time trying to break the code. It was just a game. But, last week I broke the code. Wheeler's into black market computer chips, illegal bank payoffs. And I'm certain a lot of people are dead because of him. This guy is evil. Here's to Wheeler, the best thing that has ever happened to San Carlos. Thank you very much for your vote of confidence and thank you for those very kind words, but let's face it, it's teamwork that is going to change the face San Carlos. It's teamwork that is going to build one of the greatest resorts in the world. And it's only because of friends like you and your efforts that it's going to happen. So, I drink to you. Catherine. Gentlemen, may I present Catherine Martin? Nice to meet you, gentlemen. Dinner is served, sir. Let's eat. Honestly, I'm telling you the truth. I was never given anything but the construction account here in San Carlos. Then what? This morning I went to the police in San Carlos. I told them everything. Because you're a good citizen?Exactly. They didn't understand the delicate nature of my predicament. I was just trying to be a good citizen, okay? Okay. What did the police tell you? They told me to go back to my hotel and wait. [SCOFFS] Back to your hotel and wait? And Wheeler told the police to pick you up, which means Wheeler knows everything. The Americans. I don't like it. Another escape. It's too soon after the last one. Who knows? Maybe you'll catch him yourself. Get your name in the paper, nice picture, all of your medals. You'd like that. Come on. Relax. I knew I couldn't erase the access station from the copy request. Copy request? Did you make a duplicate disc? Well, yes. Well, no. Did you, or didn't you? It doesn't matter anyway. I'm sure they found it by now. [SIGHS] We're in big trouble, aren't we? Yeah. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] It's a beautiful place you have here. I love it. I want to show you something. HOWARD: Nice.Once we get the roads in, it's gonna take my engineers only two years to turn this jungle into paradise. That's an ambitious plan you've got there, Lloyd. Yeah. You are, uh, gonna need lots of help. Permits, ecological reports. That's why I've got you. Ah-ah, don't touch that. The tips are covered with curare. It's a very deadly poison. Hmm, I hope your homeowner's insurance is current. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Vamanos. Wait. Wait. Oh, wait, I want to go with him. Jack! Jack! [GROANS] Let's work something out. What do you say? Work something out. It'll be good, very good, for everybody. Take it easy... [SPEAKS SPANISH] Hermano. What? [SPEAKS SPANISH] Hermanito. What? [LAUGHING MANIACALLY] Anything you want. Just tell me. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Adonde esta tu amigo? What? What? Tu amigo? Adonde esta? Just don't. I'll do anything. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Adonde esta tu amigo? Listen, you and I, we can make a deal. We can work something out, me and you, okay? [SPEAKS SPANISH] Adonde esta? I'm convinced it was the American. He's the only one that Steiner has spoken to. I will kill them both. No. Mr. Wheeler has other plans. You know what to do with this. When you're finished, put him in his cell with the other one. We'll use it to track him when they escape. [CRICKETS CHIRPING][OWL HOOTING] [CLANKING] I got you. Here, sit down. [CELL DOOR CLOSES] STEINER: Who's there?You rest. It's okay. [LIGHTS CLICK OFF] Jack, I don't feel so good. You just relax. No, you don't understand. All those stories I didn't believe about Wheeler, I think I believe 'em now. He's the great white hunter who gave up on animals a long time ago. I think we're next on his list. I never thought I'd die like this. A hunted animal. It's not over yet. What's the area like outside this prison? It doesn't matter, Jack. We're trapped inside this cell. Trees... Then a river. Then the jungle. I am Jose, and this is my friend, Manuel. We would like to come with you. I know the way. Perfect. Then we know what's out there, we know who's coming with us. So how do we get out of here? We need some water. What? What does water have to do with us getting out of here? [SPEAKS SPANISH] Agua, por favor. Thank you very much. I'll talk to you tomorrow.Yeah. Madam, my pleasure. It was my pleasure. Well... I still have some work to do tonight. Seems like we never have enough time. No, we don't. Maybe we should plan that hunting trip. It's a date. [PRISONER SCREAMS] [LAUGHING MANIACALLY] Hello, amigo. [SINGING IN SPANISH] Here's the water... That you needed, amigo. Drink it all you want. [CLOCK TICKING] [BULLET HITS GROUND] Let's get out of here! [SIREN BLARING] Shit! Come on! Stay down. What the hell is this? Looks like your size. [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING CONTINUES] Go! [GUNFIRE] Come on. Come on. [GUNSHOT] He's dead. We got to go. [GUNSHOT] Is he really dead? [TELEPHONE RINGS] Morning. Escaped on their own? Huh. You kidding? I was born ready, baby. It's not a problem for me. Hey, I appreciate people who take initiative. Not a problem. I'll just push my schedule ahead one day. I'll see ya. I'm on my way. Catherine. Hey, good morning. I wake you? Oh, good. Remember that hunting trip we talked about? How's today sound? Good. I'll pick you up in a little bit. Yeah. [BIRDS CHIRPING] You're leaving a trail a blind man could follow. Sorry. Sorry. [YELLS IN SPANISH] Apurase! [SPEAKS SPANISH] Amigo, correle. [CONTINUES IN SPANISH] Tu buscas si hay un medico. They've got a head start, but we should close the distance. Well, how are we gonna them in the jungle? That's the easy part. Who the hell are these guys? They're with the colonel. Indian trackers, the best. I'll bet. Those are Douglas' men. Very best. My men are ready. Let's get 'em! [JEEP STARTS] This way. We have to hurry. It rains. This is good. The trail will be harder to follow. Good.I've had it. STEINER: I can't run anymore. Which way? Away from the road, through the valley, and into the jungle. From there, the song of the spirit will guide us. The trackers are the ones that can't follow us there. Into the jungle? I thought that's where we were. What are you talking about? The jungle of the shadow people. If we can make it there, the jungle will help us. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Whoa, whoa, wait. I don't think we should follow this guy. I mean, he sounds a bit off to me. You want to stay and wait for Wheeler's men? Be my guest. I don't want to stay here and wait for Wheeler's men. [VEHICLE APPROACHING] I know this Indian. He will take them to his people in the jungle. Jose... How many men do you think they have? Many. The Coronelalways provides his best men to Wheeler. And that man, Douglas, he has men, too. Maybe 15. Colonel? Who's the colonel? He runs the prison. A very bad man. He has killed many of my people. Wow, did you...Save it. Save it. This time, I will be the hunter, and Mr. Wheeler will watch. What's up? They have taken the long way. You take this trail, we'll be on them in ten minutes. Let's do it. [EAGLE CALLS] This is the path. We will be there soon. Listen, Jose... Jungles scare the hell out of me. Only those who will hurt the jungle need fear, and there is one who the jungle is waiting for. How you doing?Great. How you doing? Love it. I know this country. They'll come on the ridge. Wait for me here. [INSECTS BUZZING] STEINER: I can see 'em. They're right behind us. Keep moving. Douglas, hold up. I want to slow the pace. Slow the pace? They're less than a half a mile ahead of us. Yeah, I know that. I want to give them a sporting chance. We're going to camp in the jungle tonight. We'll catch 'em tomorrow. I understand. Catherine. [LAUGHING] I win. The prize is mine. Wheeler loses! Coronel. You will not kill my people anymore. No, Jose! [CORONEL SCREAMING] [INDISTINCT FIRING] What was that? [BIRDS CALL] [HOWLING] [MONKEYS SCREECHING] [HOWLING] Oh, my God. HAZARD: He saved our lives. STEINER: What do we do now? We pick up the pace. Let's get some distance on 'em before dark. [BIRD CRIES] [ANIMAL SCURRIES] STEINER: Damn, did you see that? All right. We'll rest here awhile. I don't think they're following us anymore. What, you mean they're not after us anymore? No. I mean they've stopped for the night. They'll be on our trail in the morning. You can count on it. Jack... Why are you helping me? I mean, I got you into this. And you know your chances are better without me. Yeah, you're right. Cut some leaves off that tree. Cover up with them. We'll sleep here tonight. They'll keep the bugs off ya. How do you know about sleeping in the jungle? How do you know they're not chasing us anymore? [BIRD CRIES] Oh, by the way, that was pretty slick at the prison today, Hazard. Hey, where'd you get a name like Ha... Jack? Jack? Jack! [ECHO] I was just kidding, Jack. [BIRD CRIES] WHEELER: These guys have been a tremendous help to me. And without the colonel to keep the criminal element out, I'd be lost. Wheeler. Excuse me. Yeah. We should have them before noon tomorrow. That scream this afternoon? Trackers found the colonel dead with an empty Uzi in his hand. So he tried to hunt on his own, huh? [LAUGHS] Aw, he is a stupid man. A dead stupid man. Well... [CLEARS THROAT] The colonel was found dead today. What? We're obviously dealing with some... Some very dangerous people. I'm sorry. I know he was a good friend of yours. Yes. I'm gonna go for a walk. Would you like to join me? I'd love to. Hey, Doug... I want you to tell the guys thank you for a great day today. Tell them to get a good rest tonight because tomorrow's gonna be a very tough day. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [SNIFFING] Oh, shit. [GRUNTING] [GROANS] [SCREAMING] What was that scream? There was something in the jungle. And the trackers went out after it. We got ourself a player out there. This guy could be a problem. We should break camp now and close the gap. You got to relax. Post more men if you want. We'll start again in the morning, But I'm in no hurry. Relax. Oh, it's you. You scared the shit out of me. Where the hell did you go anyway? I thought you left me for good. We gotta move fast. They'll be coming soon. I'm starving. Can we get something to eat? They're coming soon? I thought you said... I had to kill one of the trackers.What? You were in their camp? But how'd you find it? Where? Let's go. We eat later. You know, Jack, I think there's other people here. Yeah, I know. What? Here, give me that. Wait here. Don't get out of the river. They'll see your tracks. What are you doing? I'm going to cut down the odds. WHEELER: What is it? They're still in the stream, but there's something else here. Stop! Nobody move! [SCREAMS] Oh! [MOANING] It worked, but they're still alive. I thought we were gonna take them out. We did take them out. Wheeler would just bury dead men and keep on coming. An injured man needs help to get out of the jungle. That's what we're doing, right? Yeah, they'll have to send men back with the injured. Damn, that's good. Hey, what'd you say you did for a living? It's what I was afraid of last night. We gave him enough time to set this trap. We have to push him, or this is going to happen again. You think he's that good? I am going to lose my men before we get him. Well, there's the challenge, isn't it? And I'll tell you what, I'm gonna let him play it out a little bit before I bring him in. Indulge me. If I haven't caught him by the end of the day, then I will use the locator, huh? Catherine... You coming? [THUDS] Steiner, quit fooling around. Come on. [BIRD COOING] So... We're three hours ahead of 'em, right, Jack? Yeah, about that. Come on. Jack, Jack, how far ahead are we now? Same as we were five minutes ago. Shouldn't we, um, shouldn't we get going? We're stopping because this is where they'll camp tonight. What? So we're just going to wait for them to come here? I don't get that. Wait a minute. How do you know they're gonna stop here? Steiner, shut up. Go find me a small round rock. How small? About that small. But more round. WHEELER: Douglas, we'll go to the locator tomorrow, and, um, pass the word to the men, the first kill is mine. I like this. We'll camp here tonight. You got a problem with that? Just a feeling. What a beautiful place. Are we gonna camp here tonight, Lloyd? Yep, this is where we're gonna camp. Ooga-booga. If you don't want a boring dinner, you shouldn't invite so many people. Here's to you. To the future. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] Keep alert. I don't like this place. [CLATTERING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] What the hell is that? MAN: Spread out. It's coming from the trees. I think it's coming from the trees. What is that? MAN: Whoa! Get down! Look out! What the hell is going on? [SCREAMING] Get down! Look out! Vamanos! Douglas! Douglas! Come here. Where's Douglas? Where's Douglas? Where the hell is Douglas? Lloyd, hat are you doing? This man is hurt. Shut up! Just leave him alone. Douglas! What the hell is going on? Where the hell were you? It's got to be this American again. How did he know we were camping here? Who's hunting who here? I want you to get on the phone. I want you to find out where this guy came from. I want this hunt finished. Do you understand? That's fine with me. Ow! God! Shit. I prefer a stand-up fight any day to the game we're playing here. I'm sending three of my best men out tonight, but with the locator. No more games. [GROANS] Just find him. What are you looking at? Ah, shit! Your little boy scouts okay? What's the holdup? Just making sure the medevac chopper is on its way. The tracker disappeared last night. Yeah, well, he's probably hiding in San Carlos with the three boys that you sent out last night. Don't worry about my men. They'll do the job. You should be worrying about Steiner's friend. I just talked to your office on the radio. His name is Jack Hazard, a cop out of L.A. He's a cop? Ha! Hey, do you think they fell for our trap last night? I hope so. Well, we probably stopped them, didn't we? Don't count on it. But I'm sure we pissed them off. You know, your answers don't exactly make me feel any better. Well, stop asking questions, then. No food, huh? He's not eating it yet. Probably have to mix them together. I've read about this stuff. Then when I opened my eyes, I saw his face right in front of me. I jumped up, and then he disappeared. Does this make any sense to you? Yeah, it makes sense. What you saw was one of the shadow people. They've been with us since we crossed the river. You're kidding me. We're being followed? Well, if they're following us, what do they want? That I don't know. Jose said they were waiting for somebody. There, that should do it. Steiner, what are you eating? Nothing. Good. A lot of stuff out here is poisonous, you know. Come on. Keep up. Check their position. I do not want to have to backtrack. [LOCATOR BEEPING] They've changed directions. How close? At least two miles. Have your men in place. Ready to close the trap. Come on. Come on. Don't want to miss the party. Didn't know you liked computer games. [ANIMALS SCREECHING] Hear that? What? All I hear is jungle. Hold it. What now? I hope it's food this time. Maybe. I want you to follow this river to the pool down below and wait there. I'll catch up. You'll be there soon, right? I'll be there. Seriously? Seriously. Building inspector. Yeah, right. That guy's no building inspector. That's crazy. Doesn't let me rest, doesn't let me eat. Now he wants me to find a pool. Yeah, that's easy to find. God, I'm tired. I'm going to get lost. [RUSTLING] [GROANS] [GRUNTS] [RUSTLING] [GRUNTS] [GROWLING] How much farther? They're close. I'd say they're between us and the far ridge line, heading north. All right then we gotta split up. Send your men along the ridge, the three of us will take the valley. I'd rather take the ridge line. I don't think that's a good idea. Look, I've been okay so far. What else can go wrong? Go with her. Steiner. I'm glad that's you because I don't have any energy left to, uh, run away from anything right now. Hey, did you get any... It's okay. You can eat 'em. Mmm. Hey, these are great. I'll tell you what, Steiner. You stay here, And I'll find you something else to eat. All right. Don't move. Great. You can count on it. Ha! [SCREAMS] [MACHINE GUN FIRING] You're losing it, man! Ha! Don't you fuck with me. Don't you fuck with me! [SHOUTING] Yee-ha! I think I hit one of them. Roberto, you take this trail. We'll go down this way, meet him at the bottom. Hey! Aah! Whoa. I knew it! I knew it! I wasn't even scared. What an entrance. I mean, how did you... That-that was the most amazing thing I've ever seen. How does a cop from L.A. know how to handle himself so well in the jungle? How the hell do you know who I am? What are you, the CIA? That's right. We've been after Wheeler for over two years. You lied to me, Jack. You really are a cop. And you... What's CIA doing down here? I came to get you. I need the information you have to help me take Wheeler down. The information he did have. Where is Wheeler now? Not far behind. Douglas is with him. HOWARD: They know exactly where you guys are. How?Wheeler's got a locator device. One of you's carrying a bug. I suggest you find it.Son of a bitch. Must be you. What? Why me? [STUTTERING] Jesus, Jack, what are you doing? What are you...Spread 'em. You know, you're treating me like a criminal here. Ah, here it is. [BEEPING] [BEEPING STOPS] What? They found the bug. God! We've got to find a better place than this to make our stand. I agree. Wait, wait, wait, if this place is so bad, why'd you have me sit here the whole time? Bait. Bait? You used me as bait, Jack? I could have been shot. What are you doing, using me for bait? DOUGLAS: This one is dead. A broken neck. I thought you said these were your best men. They were the very best. Ooh. [CHUCKLES] That other soldier was with Catherine. Where is she now? Are you sure? I'm sure. Why don't you call her? She's your friend. STEINER: You guys know that I'm the last one that's gonna harp on an issue, but you used me as bait, Jack. Bait! Doesn't this guy ever shut up? STEINER: Human being!No! Who's your contact in San Carlos? Embassy. Do they know you're out here? I didn't have a chance to contact them. Well, without Steiner, you couldn't prove anything anyway. Hey, no problem, gringos. What do you mean, "no problem"? I got it. I got the whole thing. Wheeler's black-market stuff, his payoffs. You told me they would have found the duplicate disk. Uh, even if they did, it wouldn't matter, because, you know, I spent a whole night making a printout. Where is it? I mailed it to my mother, in Detroit. What? Remember when you were checking into the hotel? That's when I sent it. WHEELER: Catherine, this is Lloyd. Come back. Catherine, this is Lloyd. Do you read me? Maybe they got her. Maybe she's hurt. Maybe she's joined them. Catherine, this is Lloyd. Come back. Come in, come in. Lloyd, I've been looking everywhere for you. Where are you? I'm on the ridge. Give me some landmarks, and we'll work our way toward you. We're right here, you slimy rat's ass. So why don't you come and get us, [STUTTERING] you cork-headed gorkin! I'll tell you something else! We got a whole printout on your operation, you chicken-livered, heinie-butt-eater! Sorry. Sorry. Steiner, you thieving little shit! Catherine, I'm very disappointed in you. I had great plans for you. I had great plans for you, too, Lloyd. Right, okay, here's what we're going to do. You've had your little game. Now it's my turn. I've called for backup. Just so you know, this game's not over yet. I'm gonna give you a chance to give me my $10 million right now. Then we can all go home. HOWARD: You stole $10 million? I mean, it was easy. You know, I like to hack around with computers. I set up a Swiss bank account. I didn't think he'd find out for months. You little crook. I did it for the whales, you guys. I'd never steal anything for myself. I mean, someone's got to help them. I love whales, okay? That's why I did it. Do we have a deal? Hazard, are you there? Do you read me? Do we have a deal? Well... No deal. You're taking the fall for this one. Ha! Ha! You'll never get out alive. As for you Steiner, you buck, you better grow eyes in the back of your head. 'Cause I'm gonna stuff the ones you have down your throat! Come on and try. I took out the other amateurs you had out here. Oh. Oh, your girlfriend. Did you know she was CIA? Well, of course you did. You're not stupid. So, come on, Wheeler, what are you waiting for? Fasten your seat belts, Hazard, I'm on my way. That ought to do it.Yeah, I'll say that ought to do it! Because he's probably on his way up here right now with a castrating device. Let's hope so. The odds are with us now. I want to take Wheeler out before his reinforcements get here. I want him just as bad as you do. Those are my men he killed, but that doesn't change the fact that he's a dangerous man. Let's wait for backup to arrive. You know what? I don't give a shit what you think anymore. Wait, wait. Wait a minute. [CLICKING] You hear that? What's that sound? Yeah, what is it? [RUSTLING] The song of the spirits. Jose said the song of the spirits would guide us. This is the sound trail. What? Are you going to share that with everybody? WHEELER: Ha! The best of the best, huh? Hey, Mr. Best of the best, What happened to your elite troops, huh? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't see anybody here but you and me, Mr. Best of the best. Hey. Whose side are you on anyway? Hey, don't forget who got you out of jail. You got me in it in the first place, You psychotic son of a bitch. [GUNSHOTS] Ha! Let's not forget who's who here, boy. This is my deal. This is my show. This is my expedition! I'm the bwana, and you are my boy! I own you, and you owe me. I don't owe you shit. You stupid black bastard. Ha![GUNSHOT] [GRUNTS] [WHEELER YELLING AND GRUNTING] We're even. [ANIMALS SCREECH] STEINER: Wow. This place is so beautiful. What is it? HAZARD: It looks like a temple. HOWARD: It looks like we stepped into the past. This is where we'll make our stand. Catherine, I want you to circle around, find a vantage point. Go for position. You'll need this. Thanks. Good luck. What do you want me to do, Jack? Go find a place to hide. No problem. [ANIMALS SCREECHING] MAN: Ground unit one, this is chopper two. We need a landing coordinate for that backup unit. Come back. Chopper two to ground unit one, please respond. Over. I'm right here! Ground unit one, this is chopper two. Please respond. Over. This is Wheeler. I'm here. Where are you? Over. Ground unit one, this is chopper two. Please respond. Over. Where are you? This is Wheeler! I'm right here, you son of a bitch! Ah, you piece of shit! [GRUNTS] [LAUGHING MANIACALLY] Hazard! Hazard! I knew you'd be waiting for me. This got nothing to do with Wheeler. I know. I killed him. Maybe in another time, another place, we could have been on the same side. I don't think so. [GUN COCKING] Then what are we waiting for? DOUGLAS: Hyah! [BOTH GRUNTING] I'm going to have to kill your ass. You want your knife? [BOTH GRUNTING] I don't need the knife. Get up! [BOTH GRUNTING] [BOTH ROARING] Uh... Steiner... I think I can use a little help. Is he all right? STEINER: Yeah, we're fine. [STEINER GRUNTS] STEINER: Hey, what happened to Wheeler? HAZARD: Douglas killed him. STEINER: That's it? HAZARD: That's it for this world. I'm sure where he's going, he'll get what's coming to him. [STRAINING] [GRUNTING] Who are you? I am your shadow. We have been waiting for you. You will destroy the jungle no more.
