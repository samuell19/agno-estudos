[dramatic music] [roaring] [music continues] [music continues] [clanging] - Mr. Nordley. - Yeah? Captain Gannet wants to have a word with you. What about? I'm sure Captain Gannet will tell you, Mr. Nordley. I'm sure he will, Mr. Tulper. [clanging continues] [typewriters clicking] [clearing throat] Sit down, Mr. Nordley. [dramatic music] Uh, I've got a boat to get ready, Captain Gannet. Yes. You're chartered on a coast wise trip.. ...to Bawdsey, I see. - That's right. - Passenger named Anselm? Yeah. I'm expecting him this morning. Hmm. It is a coast wise trip. Well, that's what my manifest says. Then you're not going foreign? Not unless I filed foreign on my manifest. Do you always, Mr. Nordley? I'm trying not to understand you, captain. I suggest it's in your interest to do so. You're licensed under authority from my office to operate a charter service out of British ports. You're subject to British law. You see, Mr. Nordley, not being a British subject does not entitle you to special privilege. I never asked for special privilege. But we have proof that you've taken it made it a practice to go foreign without proper clearance. Sure. I smuggled contraband cheese in the works of unregistered watches. I am not amused...I must caution you, Mr. Nordley. You risk suspension of your license perhaps confiscation of your boat. That is all, Mr. Nordley. [dramatic music] [birds chirping] - Mr. Nordley? - Yeah? - I am Mr. Anselm. - How do you do? - Can you cast off at once? - I'm provisioned. Ready to shove off within an hour. Good. (Tulper) Oh. Mr. Nordley. - Is this your passenger? - Yeah. I should think carefully on what the captain has said. Oh, I will, Mr. Tulper, I will. [dramatic music] [waves crashing] - Stowed away alright? - Yes. It's quite comfortable. - You feeling sick? - Yeah...just a little. Well, we are pitching some. I can take in the jib. No, no. I...I'll be alright. You always handle this boat alone? It's no problem coast wise. - I could help. - You a sailor? I'm a Dutchman. Ha ha ha. No. There's no need for you to crew, Mr. Anselm. If you like, I could pick up another hand at Bawdsey. I don't want to go to Bawdsey, Mr. Nordley. It's your money. Where do you wanna go? Holland. Mr. Anselm, do you mind putting down those glasses? Thanks. Now, you chartered me for a seven day cruise along the East Coast, fifty pounds. Now, you wanna go across the North Sea? Port of Maassluis. We arrive at Maassluis by morning. You wait for me two days. Then we put back to Baymouth. Oh, now, you're not going to take inventory of those whitecaps again, are you? You wanna go to Holland, but I'm not cleared to go foreign. If I decide to take you, I'll have to radio Baymouth. No. I don't want the Port Authorities to know that the Aloha left English waters. Mr. Anselm, that's illegal. Only if you're caught, Mr. Nordley and you won't be. What do the police, here or over there, want you for? I can assure you, Mr. Nordley the police do not want me. I'm sorry. I can't trust a man who isn't wanted by the police. Especially when I'm asked to risk my license and my ship. - I depend on her for my living. - It's a small risk. And I can pay well. How well is well? You may name a reasonable price Mr. Nordley...tax free. Of course, you had this in mind when you chartered me. Of course. It wasn't my advertisement in the newspaper? - No. - Who told you about me? A man in the Hague who knows you. [chuckling] Charlie Ponz. Five hundred pounds. Agreed. Two hundred fifty when we arrive at Maassluis.. ...and the balance when we return to Baymouth. And now, if you'll forgive me, I.. ...I will go below. I'm Dutch, but I truly do not feel too well. [dramatic music] [waves crashing] We're running close, Mr. Anselm. Would you like some breakfast? Mr. Anselm. [dramatic music] Mr. Anselm. [music continues] [music continues] [paper crackling] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [thudding] [music continues] [clicking] [paper crackling] [clicking] (Nordley) 'Calling L.B.E.' This is the Aloha. The Aloha. Calling L.B.E. L.B.E [music continues] (female #1) 'Hi, there.' [music continues] [motor revving] [music continues] Hello, there. - Thank you. - Pleasure. Did you have a good crossing? Fair. Good. I was worried. You were? Why? Well, he's not a very good sailor. Although, he doesn't want to admit it. Where is he? Down below? How did you know he was aboard? He sent me a telegram. This is the Aloha, British? Yeah. Well, then, why do you look so surprised? He's aboard alright, but, uh.. ...is he any relation of yours? Yes. My father. I see. Miss Anselm. There's something wrong, isn't there? I'm sorry, Miss Anselm, but weren't you notified? 'I radioed the harbor master at Maassluis.' He's dead, isn't he? His heart. [sighing] I want to see him. Don't you think you should wait? No, I want to see him. In the cabin below. [clanging] Try the heels on his shoes. [dramatic music] [motor revving] [dramatic music] [clicking] [music continues] [thudding] Sergeant Straatma from the Maassluis Police. - How're you, sir? - How do you do? Since it is a death, we have to notify them. You say Herr Anselm complained of feeling ill? Yeah. We were few hours out of Baymouth, he looked sick. Said he'd feel better if he went to his bunk. When did you discover his death? This morning. Four o' clock. I radioed the harbor master. Yeah. Harbor master got his call. Four hours, fifteen minutes. I think I would like to go below. He looked sick when I brought him tea at 23:00. His face was chalky. His skin was clamming. I thought he was just sea sick. We were pitching quite a.. [dramatic music] You will come ashore with me, please, Mr. Nordley. [music continues] [speaking Dutch] [music continues] Sit down, mynheer. [dialer whirring] Hoff Commissar Van der Stoor. Sergeant Straatma. Thank you. Cigarette, mynheer? Thank you. [telephone ringing] Excuse me. Sergeant Straatma. [speaking Dutch] - You will come with me, please. - Where? - To The Hague. - Why? Hoff Commissar wishes to speak with you. - What about you? - Your passenger. Oh, now, wait a minute. I've explained everything to you. I-- Because, Mynheer Nordley, your passenger named Anselm is Inspector Sluiter of The Hague police. You will come with me. [dramatic music] [engine revving] [music continues] [door creaking] [knock on door] (male #1) Come in. Come in. Oh, yes, yes, of course. How do you do, Mynheer Nordley? Thank you, Zappa. You know, of course, that your passenger was Inspector Sluiter. Hmm? - You know that, of course. - I know it now. When did you find out your passenger was Inspector Sluiter? - When I arrived at Maassluis. - Not when he chartered ship? No. He introduced himself as a Mr. Anselm. Yes, yes. So, you stated at Maassluis. Uh, tell me exactly how did Inspector Sluiter come to charter your ship? I run a advertisement in the "London Times." He answered it. To cruise, you said, in England waters. Yeah. And then, he changed his mind. Didn't that seem curious to you? I make my living taking people where they wanna go. And no questions asked, huh? - Sit down, please. - Thank you. Inspector Sluiter was in London on official investigation for the Hague Police. We do not know, uh, not yet why he chose this unorthodox method of returning. But we have reason to believe he was returning with an important document, uh.. 'A paper perhaps or a letter.' When he came aboard your ship at Baymouth he had only his suitcase with him...and this? Yeah, that's right. Did you go through Sluiter's luggage? What would you've done? Man cams aboard for a coast wise cruise. He pays me extra to take him to Holland, then dies on me. I went through his things. I'd have opened the briefcase. But I couldn't find the key. But the lock of the briefcase, you see, has been forced. - His daughter did that. - His daughter? She hailed me, and came aboard as I was approaching Maassluis. Paul, I want to see Inspector Sluiter's daughter at once, please. She's here? Why does that surprise you? She disappeared after searching her father's belongings. Uh, you know, uh, Mynheer Nordley.. It is not very polite of me, but.. ...I have not believed a single word of your story. We'll you'll have to settle for it. It's all the story I've got. Now, the medical examiner at Maassluis found marks of adhesive tape on Sluiter's body but no wound, no injury as if he'd had something.. ...strapped to his side. I never give my passengers physical examinations. Not even post mortem? How much did Sluiter pay you? Fifty pounds. Now, you had only nine pounds, seven shillings when you landed at Maassluis. No money was found on board the Aloha by the police. What happened to the fifty pounds that Sluiter paid? - He hadn't paid me yet. - So? Don't you ordinarily ask for payment before you put out on such a trip? Said he'd pay me out of that. Out of what? Out of the money here on the table. Uh, uh, out of this? Yes, he said he'd pay me as soon as we arrived at.. Then you knew he had this money. You saw this money. Either you or he opened the briefcase. Uh, no. But you just said he told you he would pay you out of this money. Well, he told me he had it. And once again, you just trusted him. Now, you're being difficult, mynheer. Now, please, do not be difficult. It makes rude when I have to deal with difficult people and I do not like to be rude.. ...so, please.. [knock on door] Come in. (Van der Stoor) Ah, my dear. Tell me, have you ever seen this young man? - No. - And you, Mynheer Nordley. You recognize this young lady? No. Then I introduce Inspector Sluiter's daughter. She's not the girl who came aboard my ship. That I believe. Finally, something I believe. She's not the girl who came aboard your ship. Then who is the girl who you say came aboard your ship? - I don't know. - Or was there such a woman? Alright, look. I've bought all of this I can use. I'm sorry for Miss Sluiter and the Hague Police and the whole world, but I won't be nibbled to death by you. Through with your questions? I'll show off for England. You will shove off for England when I release you. Are you arresting me? Holding you as a material witness till after the inquest. Well, I'm not sure you can hold me. You can communicate with the British Embassy. That is your privilege. Well? - I'm not a British subject. - American? Very well, then. The American Embassy. You may use the telephone. So I went foreign without a clearance. That's something for the British to worry about not enough for you to hold me in Holland. The man aboard my ship died of a heart attack. The man aboard your ship did not die of a heart attack. The man aboard your ship was murdered Inspector Sluiter suffered from diabetes. These insulin capsules should contain 10 units per cubic centigram 'but somebody changed them' for 100 unit capsules. Inspector Sluiter died of an overdose of insulin taken about 10 o' clock yesterday morning. He didn't come aboard my ship until one thirty. That remains to be verified. You will, please, go with the officer, mynheer. [dramatic music] [clanging] [music continues] - Nordley, John? - Yeah. Your personal belongings. [clanging] Sign the envelope. Sign here. - What's that? - Release on bail. - Who bailed me out? - I do not know. You must remain within the city limits of The Hague. If you leave, your bail is revoked and you become a fugitive. But my boat's harbored at Maassluis so I'd like-- The Aloha is in police custody under guard. No one is allowed aboard. I've got no place in The Hague or money. The bail application states that you reside at the Hotel Fonesca. Mr. Van der Stoor here make the reservations? Mynheer Van der Stoor only makes jail reservations. Sign here. [dramatic music] [vehicles zooming past] Hey. I'll be at the Hotel Fonesca. [music continues] [engine revving] [music continues] [bell ringing] - Yes. - My name's Nordley. Have you got a reservation for me? Nordley. Yes, sir. Room 206. What's the rate? It's been paid, sir. Who paid for it? I don't know. It's down in the book as paid. - Give me a line? - I'll get the number for you. Just give me a line. I'll dial it. [dialer whirring] Charlie? Me. [sighing] I'm okay. Don't say anything. Just meet me in one hour. Usual place. Hey, Peter Pan. Tell Van der Stoor I want permission to go aboard my ship. Please? - I need clothes. - Please? Look. It's your job to tail me. Okay. I won't give any more trouble than is necessary. Tell Van der Stoor I wanna go aboard my ship to get clothes. You can go back to your comic strip now. [keys clanging] - Ah, good morning, mynheer. - Morning. Permit me. Dekker, Wilhelm Dekker. I hope you find your quarters satisfactory. Here, mynheer, is your bath. Uh, come, see. It's very comfortable. Here. Come, please, please. Tub and douche. And here, you see all the implements for your toilet. Razor, soap, lotion, comb, brush.. ...teeths brush. Even paste for the teeths. Looks like you thought of everything, even to the teeths. - Where do I said my thanks? - Oh, please. No thanks are necessary. I know how it is to be in difficulties in a strange country What kind of perfume do you use? Do you like it, mynheer? It's a special blend, a secret formula. A lady makes it up for me. Should I send you some? Yeah. Tell her to leave a quart on my doorstep every morning. A quart? What kind of difficulties am I supposed to be in? Well, mynheer, would you not call it a difficulty to arrive at a Dutch port with a dead Dutch police inspector on board? Ah. It could be embarrassing, but I, uh declared him at customs. Alright, look, Dekker. You bail me out, buy a hotel room furnish me a razor, and offer me your secret formula perfume. That is how I am. What do you expect me to do to show my gratitude? A very simple thing merely to come with me to speak with my colleague Captain Rohner. Captain Rohner. Does he use the same perfume? He's a very charming gentlemen. You will like him. Yes, yes, I promise you and he is most anxious to make your acquaintance. Mm-hmm. Oh, I'm not sure I want to speak with Captain Rohner. But you must. You must, uh, believe me. Why should I believe you? Dekker, Wilhelm Dekker. You ask anyone in The Hague if you should believe Wilhelm Dekker. Alright, I'll ask, and the first one I'll ask is that police detective down in our lobby. Police de.. [chuckling] Oh, that is no police detective. That is Pieter. Pieter is employed by Captain Rohner. He is, huh? To do what? Uh, this and that. [chuckling] I'll bet. Please. Captain Rohner will be very hurt. Also, very displeased if you refuse to see him. He is.. ...very sensitive. Please. [sighing] You sure you can get me some of that perfume? Quite certain. Alright. Let's go. [squeaking] [doorbell buzzing] Ah. Mr. Nordley. How do you do, sir? Good of you to call. Permit me. - I'm Captain Rohner. - Alright. Come, sir. I think we shall be comfortable here. - Wilhelm, the whisky, please. - Yes. I trust you found your accommodation to your taste. - Better than the police cell. - Ah, yes. The police. No regard for one's sensibilities. Come, sir. Shall be talk? I'm listening. I said talk, sir.. ...which implies conversation. (Van der Stoor) 'The free flow of words and ideas' can be creative, and I prefer to be creative. But I must have your cooperation. Looks like you've got enough words for both of us. Just to prove my point, Mr. Nordley. Ah, here we are. Will you drink, sir? Depends. On? What we're drinking to. I leave the honors to you, sir. I pass. Then sir, I propose we drink to the memory of Inspector Sluiter. Poor Sluiter. Dead and gone. He'll get used to it. Ah, yes. He will. Indeed he will, sir. But, the question remains, will we? It's a blow but I'm bearing up. Perhaps, Mr. Nordley, because you knew him so little. Only well enough to tuck him in for the last time. I always regretted that I was deprived of the privilege of hearing his last word. Oh, he didn't say much. But it was touching. Yes. I'll always remember those last words. What were the words, Mr. Nordley? What were the words? - Well, he knew he was dying. - Yes. He looked up at me...eyes filled with love and forgiveness. Yes, yes. And he said.. ...he said, "I knock with seven." Then turned his face to the wall belched twice and died. I knock with seven? - Very amusing, Mr. Nordley. - Not if you'd been there. What does it mean? - I knock with seven? - Be quite. Mr. Nordley, I'm a man who dislikes violence or the threats of violence. However-- You brought me here, what do you want? - A little civility-- - Sorry out of civility. Anything else? After Sluiter died you searched his belonging. - And what did I find? - That I expect you to tell me. Sluiter was bringing back something from London. Something which belongs to me. If that belongs to you, you should know what it is. Didn't Inspector Van Der Stoor ask you about it? And I had no answers for him. I have less for you. [intense music] You're wrong, Mr. Nordley. Wrong. I think for me you will find answers. When you find the right questions. Until then don't waste my time. [dramatic music] You'll find me at Hotel Fonesoa. But I'm not gonna wait forever. And you, don't forget that perfume you promised me. [music continues] [indistinct chattering] Oh, captain sir, by creeps it is good to see you again. I've for us a bottle of good Holland gin and I must say-- Listen, Charlie, I know you. What've you got me into this time. Sending me a police inspector and I wind up with a stiff. But, captain sir, I swear it I didn't know. Would Charlie Ponz have anything to do with the police? Charlie Ponz? Does it make sense, captain sir? - He mentioned your name. - Ah, he was told to. - By who? - Rohner. A man named Rohner. Alright, Charlie, give me all of it. But it better be good. Well, captain sir, it was this way. This man Rohner, he wants to find a small boat near Baymouth with a skipper who'd like to make a little tax free money. Well, who would I give such wonderful business too? You see, you do not have to ask. Only to my dear friend Captain Nordley sir. So, I gave your name to this Rohner. But all in good intentions. Who is this Rohner? Oh, German type chap. But very British. - What kinda store does he run? - Oh, this and that. I know very little, captain sir. Why'd he come to you for a boat? Too me? Who else? Everybody knows Charlie Ponz has the best cross channel connections. - Charlie, you're a liar. - Yes. - And a thief. - Yes. - And trustworthy as a scorpion. - Yes, yes. That's true. But I cannot help it, captain sir It is my nature. But you know that you are the only one I must always be fair and square. Cards on the table. Clear and honest. Open and above board with. Charlie, I'm in a bad spot and you help put me there. I may have to call on you for help. Anytime, captain sir. Day or night. Charlie Ponz gives you both his arms. Need your help to get aboard my ship, for five minutes. - So? - There's a police guard on her. So, there's something on the ship you want to get without the police knowing? Yeah. My clothes. Oh! But, captain sir. It cannot be so serious. No, after all it is not your fault if your passenger dies of a heart attack. No, you're right, Charlie. You're right. Except that my passenger happened to be murdered. Murdered? But you were alone with him. Before he came aboard somebody slipped him a 1000 volt insulin capsule enough to blast him to orbit. Now, you're sure of this? You can take Van Der Stoor word for it. What can I do to help, captain sir? All I want is my boat and permission to get outta here. I'll have to have a lot more answers than I've got now. You've got all sorts of filthy connections. The filthiest. Get a line on Rohner, find out what his connection was with Sluiter and what Sluiter was working on in London. Will do. Now, anything else? Yeah. Give me that bottle. You can knock off for dinner now. I'm going to rest for an hour. You can pick me up later. Any messages for me? No, Mr. Nordley, but there's a lady waiting for you. Good evening, Miss Sluiter. Where can we talk with some privacy? Well, I could suggest my room but-- It will serve. Van Der Stoor sent you to see me? No, I came because you were the last to see my father alive. I think you know more about my father than you told Inspector Van Der Stoor. What more could I know? I think you know why he was on your boat. And what he had taped on his side. Do you realize what you're saying? Yes. Your father was involved in something the police know nothing about. I.. Since last night ...I've heard rumors. But I don't believe them. What kind of rumors? Do you know what your father was working on in London? I asked Van Der Stoor, but he refused to tell me. - You think you could find out? - Maybe you can tell me. Miss Sluiter, I never saw your father before he came aboard my ship. What I told Van Der Stoor was the truth. All of it? Well, almost all of it. Ah, that's like saying your wife is almost faithful to you. [chuckles] That's impossible. Of course it is impossible. But only because I haven't got a wife. [telephone ringing] Yeah. Yeah, right away. Eh.. Mm-hmm. Apartment. Yeah, I know he's watching me. I'll lose him. 'I'll be careful.' [dramatic music] Do you know a woman by the name of Elsa? No. Is she somebody's almost faithful wife? - It's not what you think. - You don't know what I think. The woman who just called is the one who said she's you. I'm glad she isn't. - You are going to see her? - Yes. - Take me with you. - I can't. Alright don't trust me, but help me. Don't trust you but help you? You're friendly with Van Der Stoor. Do two things. Find out what your father was working on and get me permission to go aboard my ship. It's important. To go aboard your ship. Yes. I'm sure it is important. [dramatic music] Uh, yeah, there's a man by the name of Pieter waiting for me in the lobby, will you call him? Pieter, this is Nordley. Uh, hold on a minute, will ya? Ja? Hello. 'Ja? Verdorie.' 'Hello. Hello.' 'Hello. Hello.' [dramatic music] (Elsa) 'Come in quickly.' You weren't followed? You're sure you weren't followed? I left Pieter holding the phone. Thank you. Thank you for coming here. And thank you for not telling Rohner that I was on your boat. Er, you know, Miss Anselm.. Anselm? Sluiter? Elsa. - You were good yesterday. - Please. What really fooled me was the stiff upper lip and the faint trace of tear. Not too much, not to little. When you said, "I want to see him." - Please, you-- - No, that's alright, angel. Performance was good, what more can a man ask? By the way you're not his daughter, are you? You make me feel ashamed. - You know I'm not. - I can't be sure of anything. You can be sure of one thing now. My gratitude. You make that sound like a promissory note. Do you like good Holland gin? Isn't there any bad Holland gin? Well, to good gin and bad little girls. Did...did you tell the police about me? No more than I had too. - What did they say? - They called me a liar. For the wrong reasons. But by turning you in now they'll believe my story. Again for the wrong reasons. Please, I beg you. Please be patient with me. When I tell you my desperate situation.. I have no one else to turn too. You can really turn it on and off, can't you? Like on the ship, I think it's that subtle touch of "alone, but oh so brave", that does it for you. Yes, I-I am alone, but I'm not brave. Yes, I lied to you on the boat but...I had no other choice. Lets funnel it down. Straight questions and straight answers. If I don't get them, I'll let Rohner try. - No. - Alright. Deal with me or him? I'll answer any questions you ask. I'll tell you all I know. I trust you. [laughing] Oh, brother! When anybody says that to me I start looking for the nearest fox hole. Don't you see, don't you understand? I must be honest with you now. Because I now depend on your strength. - Why did you meet my ship? - Because Rohner told me. - He was expecting Sluiter? - Yes. - Something Sluiter was getting. - Yes. That's what you were looking for? - Yes. - What was it? - I do not know. - You.. Oh, you're good. You're really good. But it's true. I only did what Rohner ordered. To find a certain envelope. And he now believes that I found it and I'm lying to him. He will kill me. I know he'll kill me. Unless I convince him that.. Oh, Johnny, you can help me. You can save my life. If you have the envelope. He sent you to find an envelope? - Yeah. Yes. - Find? Not get from Sluiter? So, you knew that I was delivering a dead Sluiter. No. No, how could I? Oh! You mix me all up. Rohner. Yes. It was he who knew. H-he told me to go aboard. But you just thanked me for not telling Rohner you came aboard. You've been lying to me all along, haven't you? Well, there was some truth in what I said. How much? Hmm. Not too much. Why did you call me? To stop me from telling Rohner you went through Sluiter's bags? Yes, I'm afraid of Rohner. You don't know him and what he would do. What do you expect me to do of your fears? Play your protector? Help you double cross Rohner? That's what you're trying to do, isn't it? Why should I. What did you give me a bunch of lies and double talk. I can't be of any use to you or myself unless you level with me everything right down the line. So, you really don't know. I know one thing, I don't need you or Rohner or Dekker. You need me. Yes, I need you. [instrumental music] 'Johnny.' Johnny. [speaking in foreign language] Oh, go away. [speaking in foreign language] [music continues] Pieter. Pieter. Oh! [intense music] Please. Please. All this violence it's not necessary. Pieter? Pieter, are you alright? You stay off my tail, next time, I'll have get a little rough. Please, do not hurt him again. Pieter is harmless. Captain Rohner wants to see you. Well, that's dandy, I want to see him too. What about poor Pieter? Leave him there, the air will clear his head. [instrumental music] [engine revving] - Captain Rohner. - Yes, dear boy? - It's been a long hard day. - Oh, yes. To the point. I learned that poor Sluiter did not die of natural causes unless you can call natural the inevitable result of an overdose of insulin? Yes, dreadful, dreadful. Do you take sugar? - I don't take tea. - Oh! You see that is why I felt concern when it became evident the woman Elsa was now trying her wiles on you, sir. So, Elsa was in London with Sluiter? She's the one who slipped him the insulin mickey? Oh, yes, her instructions were to return to Holland via aeroplane the very day Sluiter boarded your ship. This she did...but not to the Hague. To Maassluis. Yes, dear little Elsa had decided to go into business for herself. She intercepted your ship, knowing that you were only delivering the shell of Sluiter. Certain that she would then easily come into possession of the thing she desired most. The thing for which I'm now prepared to bargain with you. It is of course quite evident.. ...that you are in possession of the key. The key which you took from the body of Sluiter. Key to what? The key for which I have a lock. I want to buy that key. I'm willing to deal for it, but I can't deal unless I know what I'm dealing for. What lock does the key open? So, you really do not know. Well, I know one thing. Without me you're no place. (Wilhelm) 'A moment.' Lets get on with it, shall we? Mr. Nordley, you know of course of the situation which existed here inthe Hague late 1945? The allied armies were knocking on the gates of the city. The occupiers were preparing to terminate their visit. I was at that time in command of a Garrisonhere in the city. My dearest friend and most loathed Dutch citizen was a gentlemen named Maserling. - Yes, Maserling he-- - Wilhelm, please. Mynheer Maserling was the manager of the Nieuwe Hollandse Bank and he knew once our troop left his life was forfeit. 'So, we made a pact.' He was to remove from the vault of Nieuwe Hollandse Bank.. ...certain assets. I would supply him with the launch Lorain two worthy men and we were to meet in Berlin. Everything went according to plan when at a certainpoint on a certain river the launch was attacked by Dutch partisans. 'Attacked and sunk.' Maserling however managed to survive. He was later taken prisoner by the English forces. Ah, I had also supplied him uniform of a German officer. Yes, Marseling survived. But the launch lay on the bottom of the river. What river? That, sir, I know. And the precise point ...that sir, I propose to find through the use of the key. The overlay which Maserling made and which you appropriated from Sluiter. But Sluiter was a police inspector how did he fit in? I can easily tell you. Only last week Maserling died in London. Under an assumed name. Sluiter had been working on the mystery for many years. He and I entered into an arrangement. He was to come here with the overlay recover the treasure then go back to England with me. You are a man of perception. His superiors would be notified that he found nothing in Londonof import. Asimple workable plan. Until...dear little Elsa.. Mr. Nordley...no doubt you are interested in money. Well, money can be very soothing to the nerves. I'm listening. I'm prepared, sir, to offer you cash in hand 5,000 pounds for the overlay. Not good enough. Indeed? I should consider that very generous. Excellent compensation for a brief runacross the north sea. Not good enough. Oh! What do you have in mind? I'll take the same cut Sluiter was getting. He is mad. Do you realize how many years? How much money I have spent? - Spending, spending, spending? - Yes, this is true, dear boy. Wilhelm has been the sole financial support of this venture. You must consider the time and money expended. Lives already lost. I'M not interested in your double entry book keeping-- Mr. Nordley, without the proper chart for the proper river you have no other market. Well, I'm tired of bargaining. I'll give you till tomorrow morning. Otherwise? You're not the only one interested. [dramatic music] [music continues] Charlie, it's me. Meet me right away. Yeah. And Charlie, bring a gun. [dramatic music] Took you long enough. - Get the gun? - Yeah. - Everything else? - Yeah. Keep it. You'll have to use it. Me? I will have to use it? What's the matter, Charlie. Forget how? No, Captain Nordley sir. Only it's illegal, to use a gun. I shall need a good reason. Million reasons. A million pounds maybe. I've only got six bullets in the gun. Will that be enough? Three'll do it. Lets go. Alright, there's the boat. Sure you know what you've to do? Yes, captain sir. We'll meet at the Dreibruggen after it's over. Good luck. [foghorn blaring] Help! [gunshot] Help! [gunshot] [dramatic music] - Clip you? - Yeah, like a show dog. What happened, Captain Nordley sir? Does not look quite like a million pounds? Charlie, you ever hear of a man name Maserling? Yes. But yes, Captain sir. The Nieuwe Hollandse Bank. There're many stories, nobody knows what happened to him or his fortune. I had that fortune in the palm of my hand but somebody got aboard my ship. There was an envelope with an overlay inside fixing the exact spot where the launch went down. I see. That's the Rohner-Sluiter deal? Maybe, maybe it was Rohner-- No, not Rohner, Dekker or Pieter-- - Or the police themselves. - No. Not the police. They'd have confiscated the money, the gun and picked me up right away. It wasn't the police. It had to be somebody the guard knew. Somebody he let go aboard the ship. Somebody not exactly of the police but.. [instrumental music] You wait here. Don't move. I'll either telephone or come back. But you wait. [music continues] - 'Police headquarters.' - Ponz. Van Der Stoor. [telephone buzzing] - Yeah. - 'Charlie Ponz.' Hello. 'Hello. Charlie.' 'Hello.' 'Hello.' [dramatic music] You frightened me. That makes us even. You gave me a small piece of fright, too. I'd like to tell you about it. That's your apartment? I'm in a hurry. So, you did know what your father was after. - No. - No? Then why this? Why did you take only this? That's my fathers writing on the envelope. You took it from him. And you knew just where to look for it? How? I learned a few things from my father. [laughing] Yeah. I bet you did. And from Rohner and Dekker. What did you learn from them? - Who? - Rohner, Dekker. - People you were gonna meet. - Never heard of them. - I was gonna meet Van-- - Why didn't you go directly? Why did you come here first? Because I wanted to.. [mellow music] This is Captain Nordley. Any messages for me? She leave a name? 'Thanks.' [music continues] Constanta, listen to me, so many things I want to tell you but right now only one thing's important. I had nothing to do with your fathers death? It was Elsa the woman who telephoned me. She switched the insulin capsules in London. But why? Why was she with him? What was he doing on your boat? Well, I don't have all the answers yet, but one thing you can be sure off. Your father died in the performance of his duty. Yes...I must believe that. - I must. - I'll prove it for you. I'll have to finish the job he started. It's the only way I can clear both of us with Van Der Stoor. Will you help me? Help you? I think now you are helping me. Just a minute. What does.. What does this say? "Iron box in cabin." And this? "Seven Hawks." And this Seven Havikken. Seven Hawks. It's a fixed spot on a river. What river I don't know? Did you hear anything called the Seven Hawks? But of course the house of the Seven Hawks Everybody knows the house of the Seven Havikken. What is it? Now I think it's only a small farm. But many years ago seven brave people by the name of Hawk. The entire family stood on that island to hold of the Walloons. They were finally captured and the enemy captain boasted that they will die slowly one each day. And they did die there. That's why it's called the house of the Seven Hawks. On an island? Where? Baassemer Lake. Baassemer. Baassemer. All I have to do is find this landmark called Zeven Havikken. Somewhere on-on Bessemer Lake, fix the overlay on the chart and we've got the exact spot. The exact spot of what? The exact spot for which your father gave his life. [dramatic music] Constanta, this is Charlie Ponz. Another partner? Charlie, I need two things. A boat, and a chart of the Bessemer Lake. Will do. - By dawn. - Will do. But one thing. Please tell me, captain sir we're on our way to that million pounds? Yeah, we're on our way. Good. Me and the boat, captain sir. We'll be waiting at say the Driebruggen Lock. - 'You know it?' - Yeah. And you? If I want you, captain sir, you will be at the hotel? No, I'd better not go back there tonight. Can't take a chance on being picked up. So where will I find you? We'll find you, dawn, Driebruggen Lock. [dramatic music] Constanta? Yes. That, uh, call I made from your apartment.. Yes? You knew what it was. My hotel. There was a message for me. A woman had called three times during the past hour. No names. It was you, wasn't it? You called me because you knew that finding the overlay in my cabin would finish me with Van der Stoor. And you wanted to give me a chance to explain. That's why you didn't go direct to Van der Stoor. That's it, isn't it? You can't decide whether or not you like me. No...I like you. I think I like you very much. but I'm still not sure if I.. ...if I trust you. You don't think I had anything to do with your father's death? No. You seem so sure. I am sure. Van der Stoor is not. But I am sure. Why? You don't think I'm capable of killing? Yes, you are capable of killing. But if you had to, you would not kill that way. I don't think Van der Stoor would agree with you. No, he would not. Only a woman would understand what I mean. [instrumental music] (man on phone) 'Police.' Ponz. Van der Stoor. [intercom buzzing] - Yeah? - 'Charlie Ponz.' Hello. Hello, Charlie. I'm sorry, inspector, sir. I couldn't speak before. Tomorrow morning Nordley is leaving for Port of Massluis by hired car. He has arranged for a boat to pick him up and take him back to England. Must go now. Will call again. Port of Massluis.. ...hmph.. ...you can't trust anyone today. Not even a police informer. Paul? 'Hello?' Give me Captain Rohner please. [dramatic music] Is that the island? Yes. That is Zeven Harvikken. Well, let's see. There's the House of the Seven Harvikken. There's the church steeple of Alphon. The windmills at Hoogmade. 240 degrees. 130 degrees. Maserling indicates the launch was sunk right here. One million pounds! Oh-ho! The launch can't be laying in more than two or three fathoms. I can reach it on a straight dive. Charlie? - Yes, captain sir. - Pull over to the island. I know these waters, captain sir. Sandbars. - Lay to as close as you can. - Okay. [dramatic music] Hold it, Charlie, hold it. Alright, cut it off. - Did you find it? - I don't know. We're hooked on to something. Hang on to this. [music continues] I'll go down and take a look. [music continues] [music continues] - Charlie? - Eh? Has he surfaced? He is too long. Well, we've found her. About three fathoms but the current keeps kicking me away. Well, in about an hour we'll have dead slack water. I'll go into her then. Tie the life preservers to this line. - Leave it here as a marker. - Okay. - Come back to the launch. - Okay. [instrumental music] You think you will be able to get into her cabin? I don't know. There's one problem. The sand inside the cockpit comes up about a foot outside the cabin door. It might be difficult? Well, I'll just kick the cabin door in. Yes? I'll be alright. What is so important about the box that you risk your life? I wish I knew. Don't worry. Once you said "The gentle police of the Hague are now occupying my home." You have no other? What other one do I need? A man must have a place of his own. One place or another. They're all the same. But a ship, the lonely wandering. Ship, room, house.. ...loneliness is something you carry with you wherever you go. What's the matter? Why are you crying? This is not crying. It's inside crying, that's the most painful kind. It's okay now, captain sir. Please be careful. You can easily be trapped in the cabin. If I am, I'll be the richest captain sir in Davy Jones Locker. [instrumental music] [music continues] Charlie, get the guns out of the cabin. But I have a gun, captain sir. - Why, you're kidding, Charlie? - No. - Double cross? - Yes, captain sir. Fair and square, cards on the table. But I can't help myself, captain sir. It is my nature. Well, sir, what a fortuitous meeting. Is it not, Willem? And he led us right to our goal after all. 'Did you not, Mr. Nordley?' Without a deal, he came up empty handed? Yes, nothing. You won't be able to get into the launch. The cabin door's covered with two feet of silt. Very well then. We merely wait for low tide. You'll have to take the launch in. Keep the both under guard at the farm house on the island. - Okay. - 'Dekker will go with you.' I will stay here with Pieter. He will dive.. ...when the tide goes out. [giggling] Au revoir mon vieux. I leave you to the good offices of my friends. Over here. Over here. Come on. - Mein herr? - Guten tag, mein herr. This is your farm? Ja. I'm Beukleman. Where are your workers? Workers? I have no workers. There is only me and my wife. - 'It is only a small farm.' - Good. Then we shall all be cozy together in the house. But what-what is it? Do as he says. You won't be harmed. Now we go. You'll be outside guard. Do not move from here. [dramatic music] Charlie? I'm sorry, captain, sir. I told you it is forbidden for the guard to speak to the prisoners. In 15 minutes the tide'll be out. If Rohner finds what he's after what'll he do next? Do? Why, captain sir, he'll come ashore to fetch Dekker and me. Yeah? [music continues] [music intensifies] [cows mooing] Please permit me to go to the dairy. My cows, they must be milked. Ah, cows are patient people. They know how to wait. Must have been difficult for you during the war fighting on the river. Oh, yes. At night we would hear the shooting. Tsk. Terrible. You must have helped many wounded soldiers, partisans. We tried. All who came to us. 'Sick and wounded.' Yes. No matter who. Soldiers are men too. We helped whoever needed help. Our own partisans, British Commandos, Belgians. - Germans? - Yes. Once or two, even Germans. You think that is wrong, mein herr? No, I was a soldier too. I don't think it was wrong. [cow mooing] [dramatic music] Well, they're starting to dive. Would you like a cigar, mein herr? Aha. Perhaps a little gin? It'll be alright. Yeah, they're diving now. You know, you've never once asked me why we're here. What those men once the launch are looking for. They're looking for a treasure. They won't find it. They'll think I beat them to it. But I haven't. You know I haven't, don' you? What if they don't find it? What will they do? Probably come here and get vicious. That clock, where did you get it? Uh...it is a...it is a souvenir. From a launch? Yes, from a.. I-I only.. - It was-- - The launch named the Lorain. You took more than just a clock, didn't you? Yes. Yes, I-I did. You'd better tell me about it. Yes. It's a relief. I want to tell, for years I wanted to tell but we were afraid. It was during the last days of the war, wasn't it? I found a German captain, wounded, sick at the water's edge. Took him in, nursed him. Three days he was delirious, talked about a great fortune. A launch, and on the fourth day the English troops came took away the German, and we were left in peace. You found the launch? It was not difficult. At low water, high on the sandbar. And the strong box in the cabin, you opened it? Yes, and when the tide rose I towed the launch into deep water where you found her. Why didn't you tell the police? We wanted to. Gerta, she wanted me to. But-but I thought that...and I was weak. And I sold two of the pieces and after we were afraid to tell the police. We were afraid of questioning. I...I had a right to sell them. The war, the Germans took my cows, everything. I-I had a right to start again. [indistinct chattering] Yes, I sold two pieces. But you kept the rest. Where is it? What will you do with it? Turn it into the police at the Hague. I'll keep your name out of it entirely. Alright. I trust-- (Ponz) 'Conference?' Big conference. Just what is this big conference, captain sir? Charlie, your last chance. I got a deal for you. Oh, no, captain sir. As much as I have affection for you, and you know that's true. You have nothing to deal with. The stuff isn't on the launch. I got into the cabin. - But I know where it is. - Ah, wait a minute. How do I know you're telling me the truth? Tell my friend here about the German captain. It's alright you can tell him. Yes, it is true. The captain was taken prisoner from this house. And the captain's name was Maserling. Look at that clock. The Launch Lorain. Where? Where? I buried it. I buried it in-- Uh, would you leave us alone for just a minute please? Listen, I got to make him believe I'm turning the Maserling loot in. Now, I trust you again, captain sir. The deal, we split fifty fifty. We grab our boat and leave Rohner and Pieter diving for clams. The girl, what about the girl? She's part of my percentage. Okay. Show me the fortune. Oh, not so fast. How do I know you won't go back to Rohner when we find it? To Rohner? Why? Because it's your nature. But it's also my nature to double cross Rohner. This I will enjoy. Prove it. Anything. How? Eliminate Dekker. [chuckles] That's simple. Watch. Dekker? [thud] You see? He never even got my perfume. Mr. Beukleman? Empty, huh? Of course it is, you gaping imbecile. So Nordley got them after all. Get the dinghy. You'd better wait here. Willem, what has happened? it was, it was, uh.. You look surprised, Ms. Sluiter. Were you expecting someone else? Charlie, look at that. Holy.. ..mo.. [gasps] Captain Nordley, sir, this is a great moment in my life. Charlie Ponz keeps his word. - Rohner? - Yeah. Quick, this way! We can't. He's got Constanta. Oh, captain sir, a fortune in our hands and you think of dames? - Have another sack like this? - Yeah. - 'Rohner?' - Yes? (Nordley) 'I'm coming out. I've got a gun.' 'I won't use it unless you force me.' 'I'm coming out to talk.' Agreed. Rohner, I'm willing to negotiate. Splendid. I abhor bloodshed. Alright. This is what you want. You let the girl come to me and I'll toss the sack to you. No, dear boy. You throw the sack first and then I'll let her go to you. - How can I be sure-- - How can I be sure? Alright, we'll meet each other half way. You let her start walking now. Yes. The minute she reaches the half way point between us say that wheelbarrow, I'll toss the sack to you. And if you don't? You shoot her in the back. By Jove, do you think I could do a thing like that? Yeah, you would. You're right. Would and will. Done. Keep on walking. A few more steps. They'll rush us now. Take her out the back way. - You go with them. - Why? I want to make sure she gets on that boat. Go on. [dramatic music] Pieter. [music continues] [gunfire] [music continues] [gunfire] [music continues] [gunfire] [engine revving] [gunfire] [gunfire] [music continues] - Get 'em started. Go ahead. - Okay. Get aboard. You'll be alright. Police are on the island. You only know some men came with guns. Understand? Yes, but-but-but you said.. Now, where's Nordley? Nordley, Ponz, and the girl? You blundered rather badly this time. It was Nordley I was firing at. Thanks to you he got away. With the diamonds. Corporal, outside, quick! Your ship, your ship. With those you can buy a thousand ships. I only want to buy one. But, captain sir, you double crossing me? I can't help it, Charlie, it's my nature. Just a minute. Thought you had me in the sack? We were waiting for you. Yeah. Here or in the North Sea, huh? Captain sir, you mean they were-- You'll never be a successful thief until you learn to respect the opposition. 'They've had us pegged every inch of the way.' - Did you pick up Rohner? - And Dekker and Pieter. Well, for the record, they killed Elsa. That's alright because she switched the insulin cap on Sluiter in London. We knew that. Also for the record, it was Charlie Ponz who learned 'where the Maserling launch had been sunk.' 'He took us to it.' That will have to stand for the record. But I don't have to believe that. I can't stand around here barbering all day. You've got the ice, I want my boat. I've got explaining to do in England. You don't have to explain anything. There's the release order for your ship. 'And there will be a letter to the English authorities.' You volunteered your services to the Hague Police. You also receive 100,000 pounds. 'Your reward for the recovery of the diamonds.' No, I've had enough trouble. 'That reward should have gone to Sluiter.' He worked on this job a long time. He was a brave officer. He gave his life for his duty. The reward will go to his daughter. Well, so long, Charlie. Run into anybody who wants to charter a boat out of Baymouth.. How about going to the harbor with me? Tell me goodbye. I wonder if I could've outrun your boys in the North Sea. We'll never know that, will we, Captain Nordley? Oh, that Captain Nordley sir refuses the reward for him and for me, and grandly says it must go to Inspector Sluiter, but he's dead so of course it must go to his daughter, and then he walks off with the daughter and the reward. Oh, that Captain Nordley sir. [crying] I've got an idea. I may need you. But of course you need me. You will always need me. I mean on the trip back to Baymouth. Maybe I'll run into some dirty weather and I'll need another hand. Want to sign on? - What do you think? - One more thing. That envelope, how did you know exactly where to look for it? - You remember where you hid it? - Of course. Yes, so take me there and I'll show you. [instrumental music] [music continues]
