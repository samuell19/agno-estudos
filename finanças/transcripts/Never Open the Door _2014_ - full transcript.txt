Councilman Luke Davies found with a dead man in his living room this holiday season. Did anyone bring a computer or something? Stop. It's just ringing and ringing. No voice mail, no nothing. Call your father. Oh, good idea, good idea, okay. Nothing, nothing. There's no, it's not even a, it's not even a voice mail. Ah! - Nothing. - All right, a-a-a-all right, our phones are out.

It sounded like a little girl with someone. Guys, there is someone out there, and it is definitely not a little girl. All right, I think this could just be the locals, the people from the town playing a joke on us. What? All right? So I think that we should just take the body, Are you kidding me?

She was literally right here. That's true. - Here, I just heard. - She was just standing right here in front of me. Tess! Why would she go upstairs? Tess! No, she's not upstairs. She was right here. Maybe she went to go look for a power box. Maybe that's why. - But she was right here. - Oh, she just scurried up the stairs, she flipped on the light, and she scurried up the stairs? Listen, I'm just trying to figure this out, okay? No, we would've heard her. I'm starting to think that maybe we should get out of here. Tess! Let's do it.

We're all right We're okay, girls. You're okay? Well, unlock the door, it's locked. What was that? I don't know. Maybe it was the wind or something.

You might not be real. Please. Nope Listen, I'll show you my tits. Well now I know you're a fake. Should we try to get that open? What was that? Nothing. Tess? This is dark. Tess? Will you grow up, Terrence? Can't you see I'm not a fake? How the hell am I supposed to know? But there are two of you in this house. I'll believe that when I see it. Yeah, I guess I will, too. Don't you see how stupid this is? No, Tess, it just means you're fucking with us for some reason. And it's really not cool havin' a dead body in the house. But I didn't have anything to do with that. Yeah? I guess that remains to be seen. Yeah, I think it's just a window. Oh my God, there's someone out there! Oh my God, did you see that? Yes, they're looking right at us. They're looking straight at us. Do you think they can see us? I don't know. I'm feeling a lot better now. Oh, Tess. Oh! Oh my God, they're gone! What? Where do you think they went? I don't know. Oh, shit, she's, she's. All right, what was my nickname in third grade? Turtle Head. Look, can't we just wait until Luke gets back? Come on, Terrence. I answered all your stupid questions. I knew your nickname. I'm not a fake! Will you let me go? You know this is kidnapping? Oh, Christ, Tess. What, are you gonna kill me? Nobody's killing anybody here. Oh, really? Well, what about that guy over there? God, I'd love to know where he came from. There was something, but what would they be doing there? Do you think we left the front door? Oh my God, ! Don't do that. Oh my God. Oh my God, Luke, are you okay? Yes, I'm okay. Where's Isaac? He's in the room. What, what's he still doing in there? Listen, it's, I don't know what happened in there. Somebody pushed me, it might've been Isaac. Bullshit, move! - That doesn't make sense. - What, he just pushed you? Look out. Isaac! I'm not leaving here without him! Stop it, you're acting really strange. What is up with you? - Fake Isaac. - Look out! What' she doing? Stop! It doesn't make sense. What are you doing? You're so weird. Why are you acting so strange?

Maria, let's go! L-| forgot to tell you. We saw Tess inside of the room, and, and she looked really weird. And, and there was these guys, and they were standing outside, and they were wearing these suits, and, and they were looking straight at us. I mean, like, straight at us. And, and I don't know, maybe they were like the mafia, or something, and, and, and maybe they're looking for the dead body. - Babe. - So now the mafia's after us, 'too? I don't know! - Can you hear me? - Right. Babe! But you do believe me, right, Luke? Isaac, please. Issac? Issac? I can't see. Issac? Isaac! Isaac? Isaac, oh my God, honey! Are you okay? Are you, are you okay? What happened? I was so worried. Angel. What is that? Oh. Are you bleeding? Oh my God. "My Angel." You're bleeding. Honey, I was so worried about you. Didn't you hear me? Ah, I heard you. Tess, Tess is in here. She's in here. She was just here. Oh my God, what happened to you? Must've gotten out some how. I don't know. Luke, Luke hit me over the head. What?

It'll be okay. Come on. Oh my God, what do you think happened? What the hell? Oh my God, what happened here? Terrence! Where do you think they went? How should I know? They're probably fucking each other. What's the matter with you? Tess's car's gone. Maybe they went to go get help. Oh. Oh my God, are you okay? I saw Tess again. Have a seat. Okay- - Shit, shit! Oh my God, what are you doing? Why don't you ask your husband? He's completely lost it! What is he talking about, Luke? He, he punched him upstairs. Why don't you try that again right, ah, God! Damn it! Stop! Will you please stop it? Son of a bitch! Stop, step back! Calm down, Luke, okay? We have to find out, we have to find out what these men want from us. What men? These men, Angel and I, we saw them standing outside. They were in suits, just, just staring at us. Are you serious? Yes! Look, honey, I don't know what's going on. I just wanna get the hell outta here. All right, Angel, you're gonna have to toughen up, if we're gonna get through this, all right? What the hell's wrong with this guy, huh? - Oh my God, okay? - We're gonna get outta here. Okay, okay, Okay! Okay ' Guys! You know what, Luke? I don't know what happened to you, no, but, but, what we have to do right now, we have to look for Terrence, and we have to figure out what happened with Tess. Okay? Now, do you think it was these men that jammed our phones? Oh, the mafia guys, right? No, no, they were real. No, they were real. I saw them, too. I know. What if they took them? Oh, God, don't even say it, don't even say it. Well, you know, we need to make a decision now about what we're gonna do. And I'm prepared to leave all three of you behind. Oh really? Are you okay? My head hurts. Honey, I'll go get you something. Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm so embarrassed by him. Here, I'll take some of the pressure off, okay? - Please do. - Honey, this might sting, ready? Real tight. Okay- How does this feel? Tighter. Tighter? Squeeze real tight. Okay- - Can I have a word with my wife, please? Privately. Oh, this guy. Can't he see you're hurt? Guys, I'll be, we'll be right back, okay? Okay- - What? What is your problem? Okay, Luke, I get the point. What the hell? So, uh, how's Isaac's head, is he gonna make it? Listen, Luke, please. I don't care if you don't believe me about Isaac or the guys outside or whatever, but I just want to find everybody and get out of here. That sounds like a good idea, so should we take both Tesses with us? There's only a little bit of blood. I know, you're doin' good. Feeling a little better? You take good care of me, yeah. Okay, look, I saw Tess in the room, she was in there, she was with us. I know, I didn't really get a look at her. She came up, and she looked so weird. She looked so different. She came up, she licked my face. What do you mean she licked your face? She licked my face, I don't know. Like, like aggressive? Like, uh, like violent? Oh my God! What if I'm infected? She got blood on you. What if I start acting crazy like them? You're not gonna. - What if I start losing it? - You're not start acting crazy. Wait, did you wipe the blood off? Oh my God, I'm. Look. What if I start acting crazy like Luke? I mean. Look, I don't see any blood on you, you're fine, look at me. Look. He's walking around with a knife. Stop it, look at me, you're fine. So would you tell me if I started acting like him? Of course I would. You're okay? Yeah, we gotta get outta here. It might just have to be you and I though. You understand that? We might just have to go. I just wanna go home. Luke, listen, please, please. I just need you to be strong, okay? You have no idea how strong I can, you have no idea how goddamn strong I can be, you fuckin' cunt! Oh my God, Luke, what are you doing? Oh, Luke, you're scaring me. Let me ask you something. Oh my God. Luke, what is wrong with you? Is that baby even mine, Maria? Oh my God, are you serious? Luke, you're scaring me, please. What are you talking about, are you serious? Luke, I thought you loved me! Maybe too much. What? Put that down. Put it down, Luke. - Maria. - No. Maria, calm down. No, Luke, please. You're gonna hurt the baby. You're gonna hurt the baby. It's not my baby, is it, Maria? It is your baby. Please, Luke. Oh my God, oh my God! Help, help! Help! Maria! Maria, calm down! I just have to cut that bastard child out of your stomach. And then, and then we can all go home. Maria! Maria! All right, relax, girlie. We're gonna go home. We're gonna lay in bed for two weeks and I'm gonna make you magic eggs. And we're gonna get married. I can't wait. And we're gonna forget all this, all right? Promise? I promise. You still smell good. I love you. I love you, too. Okay- I just wanna... We can't leave without Maria. What? Before we go, we gotta go and get Maria. We can't just leave her up there with him. It's just not. Yeah, but you said we could go. You said we were gonna leave right now. We're gonna go. I didn't say we were gonna leave right now. We are gonna leave, and we're gonna get out, okay? And, listen, if worse comes to worse, we're gonna go, but. What was that? What was that? What was that? All right. Let's do it. Come on. Okay- Will you grab the flashlight? Oh. Okay- - All right. Maria! I know all about you and Isaac. Don't worry. I love you, I love you! Oh, please, no! No! Oh my God! Oh my God! I'm gonna kill you now, Maria. My son. Shit! Oh my God! - Oh, shit, shit, shit. - Oh my God, oh my God. - Shit, Terrence. - Are you okay? Terrence? Terrence? - Your hands. - Terrence, Terrence? Take it off, take it. Where am I? Terrence? Where's Tess? Take it easy. Sorry. - Wake up, wake up. - Where, where? - Shh, shh, shh, shh. - Where, where am I? Be quiet, man, all right? Take it easy, take it easy. Take it easy. Where am I? That's all right, that's all right, shh, shh, shh. - Where's Tess? - Shh, you gotta be quiet though, okay? Be quiet, man, all right? Just look, be cool. How'd you get here, man? Where's Tess? It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna get, I'm gonna get, okay, it's okay, okay. Are you all right, man? I think. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet. Where am I? Under the steps, take it easy, buddy. Did Tess put you here? Did she? We were, I, I just, I was talkin' to her and then. Will you grow up, Terrence? Can't you see I'm not a fake? How the hell am I supposed to know? But there are two of you in this house. I'll believe that when I see it. Yeah, I guess I will, too. Don't you see how stupid this is? No, it just means you're fucking with us for some reason. And it's really not cool having a dead body in the house. But I don't have anything to do with that. Yeah? I guess that remains to be seen. Then it just went black, I, I guess she, yeah, I guess she put me here. All right, relax, relax. So, there may or may not be two Tesses, and one may be a monster, all right? What Angel saw is. Yeah, she looked really sick. She was mutating or something. - Not like. - There's something mixed in with the blood. Let me just say that she looks really bad. Listen, we gotta get outta here tonight. She looks sick. And we gotta get Maria before we go, okay? What about Luke? No, no, Luke's gone crazy. Luke lost it. Yeah, screw Luke. We gotta get Maria and go tonight. Yeah, we gotta get outta here. Tonight? - Tonight. - Yeah. We gotta get outta here. Guys, what, shouldn't we wait til the morning? It'll be light out. No, hell no! We're in the middle of nowhere. - Terrence! - We'll be able to see a whole lot better. Terrence, Terrence, you were tied up here. How much longer did you think you were gonna stay alive here, huh? You got a point. Luke took Maria upstairs, we've gotta get her. All right? All right. Look, stay with us. - All right, let's go. - Okay. Come on, girl. Guys, what's up with the lights? Shh. Shit! Honey, Isaac! Isaac, stop! Don't do this to me! - Do what? - Let's go! Just stop, stop, what, stop what? - Don't do this to me! - Stop it, stop it. Don't do what? - I just wanna go! - Shh, shh, shh. Baby, will you stop it, will you just stop it? Listen! I just wanna go home! Baby' if there's one thing I'm sure of, we're gonna make it outta here alive. What are you doing? I just have to cut that bastard child out of your stomach! Luke, you're scaring me! No, no! I'm gonna kill you now, Maria. ' No! No. You've gotta be kidding me! Maria, it's Tess. Sorry I'm running late. Did you guys start without me? Hello? Hey, my phone's cutting out. Listen, I'm pulling up right now, okay? I'll be there in a minute. I'm just pulling in, okay? I'll be there in a minute. Bye. Terrence, Terrence. Terrence. What the, what the hell? Oh my God! (He)” Oh my God, what? No. No. No! Never open the door! Call 9-1 -1,Terrence. He's not breathing. What I don't understand is, is why was he pointing at you, Terrence? Terrence, is this a business deal gone bad, or something, you bring this into the house? It doesn't make sense. - Tess are you okay? - And why did he say never open the door Tess are you all right? Like there's somebody standing out there? She's not okay, obviously! Stop looking at her, you guys! Yeah, she's probably infected with something now. Stop it, she's gonna be fine!
