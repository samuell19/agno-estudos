LAUNCHPAD RELEASING slowhand cinema releasing The following is inspired by real events. Every movement starts with a spark. A flame, something to ignite the status quo. incite the troops. Lenny Bruce, and Abby Hoffman, right? But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Two weeks ago, We were more concerned about the talent show, than making bail. Freedom. Aint free. And... clap clap clap. Thank you very much Rolanda. Emily, who is next? Let me go find out. No! You are not! You are not the director. My little sister is coming. She doesn't need to see your little Hebrew national bouncing across the stage. Art, is not meant to be safe. So you want to censor me now? Huh?! Where does it stop? Who don't you censor? The guy not wearing a thong. Mr. Ritzer, I'm sure that wearing boxer shorts, won't do too much damage to your artistic piece. Wake me up before you go go. A musical tribute to the rise and fall of WAM. I very much look foward to it. In a different costume. Emily, who is next? You, I actually don't think it all together suck. But then again, it is a talent show trying to find talent at Booker High School. It's like trying to find weapons of mass destruction in my anus. We're on our way to the top, we can't be stopped. This cheer, sucks. We need to do something edgier. So we like, freak out the other team. OK, um... Like what? No problem, I did this last night. A two, a three, a four. Punch him in his nuts! Kick him in his hole! Shove him up a ten foot pole. Goooo, defense! In the history of cheerleading, That was so hot. Officer Weller won't expel us for that one. Hi. Good morning everybody, hey! I just thought I'd drop in, say hello. Hi ladies, how are ya? Wow! Uogh. Event committee, you know. I'll tell you a little secret. Once uh, I used to be on an event committee myself. And I know, The grunt work that you guys do, it's really But I tell you, it's the grunt work, that is gonna make this the best Holiday hoopla ever! Alright, holiday hoopla! For those of you, who have been doing grunt work, on my campaign for state school superintendent. Thank you so much! And for those of you who haven't, there's still time. Great, great. Hoopla. It's great. Ben, get your tits moving, let's go. Ready? OK! For firing up, we're sisters. We're turning up the heat! When it comes to football, we can't be beat! How did I get down here? Mrs. Rose. What are you wearing? Well, it's ferret week. The big football game, there's lots of parties. And we can't be blind to how teenagers sometimes behave at parties... Are you retarded? Really, are you a retard? You're not gonna walk around my high school, promoting sex! Oh, well principal Weller, I don't believe in premarital sex. But I do think that, We should be realistic about teenagers today--- We're not gonna give them a free pass by walking around and handing out condoms! It is offensive, disgusting, and obscene! But, I think we're on the same side--- Canon! You're suspended, 10 days. Get out! I said get out! Jesus. Oh, god. What do these, latex. Natural! Sweets, keeper. So, directors. How was your first assignment? Uhhh, let me guess. They didn't quite turn out as well as they were in your imagination, did they? Well, then. You were her success! Shall we watch some film? Lawrence? Wake me up before you go go, Is the true story, behind the rise and fall of WANG. It's a little bit dream girls, and a little bit of chorus line, but most importantly, it's a little bit you and me. Yeah Lawrence, we have rules. Martin Luther King Boulevard. Malcolm X, Boulevard. Jessie Jackson, Boulevard. What about Clatonia Joaquin Dorticus boulevard? Inventor of a device, for applying color to the side of your shoes. Where is her boulevard? Where are all, the unsung African American boulevards? Well I, Walanda Jenkins, Say no black person left behind. You tell her sister. Ooh, Walanda, let me borrow that afro for Halloween. Hello, everybody today. I glad you watch my video today. I like to be America. And happy happy, me. Please! That's how I'm still viewed by much of this country, but I am this country. My parents, are third generation Americans. Never mind, Walanda. I wanna borrow that kimono for Halloween--- Mm hmm, that's right girl! Where were you, May 2nd 1985? Well, I wasn't alive yet, But Bradley Betts was. That night, he blew chow all over Patty Ivin's silk taffeta dress. Complete and utter facial diarrhea. And, how do I know this? The making, of the prom video. I propose, we stay with tradition, and make another. Making of the prom video, as the AV Club has done for nearly two decades. That's why I'm here. The carry the torch. Drats! These outfits. Why does Halloween only come once a year? My movie, is called "Paint". Which will be an hour and a half of me watching paint. Dry. OK, just kidding. Truth is, I haven't found a subject that I found was important enough, yet. But, I will. Did you ever play paintball? My film is an in-depth look at clitoral mutilation. That's draws parallels, to the Bush-era policies towards women. Chick flick! Shut up Chuck. Yeah, give me an 'A', give me an 'S', give me another 'S'. Oh, yeah baby. Look at them blue undies. There you are, shake that hiney for me. Oh, yeah. Shake that hiney. There you are, Oh! Excellent, excellent, excellent work! Really, really. Even Chucky here his statement about the voyeuristic aspects of our society. That's exactly what I was trying to accomplish. You and me meet again after school... OK, guys. Listen, listen. Film making is a collaborative medium. That means, collectively you're gonna have to find something that speaks to all of you equally. Oh, can we... collectively chose one of our own projects? I thought that Charles' idea was pretty groundbreaking. I agree. And it also takes place in another country. It's a dissection of a people, in a culture that is both literally and figuratively, millions of miles away from us. But right here, in your school, in this school this morning, I young woman was suspended for wearing a dress, that's covered in condoms to promote safe sex. Monica Rose. I hate her, she's a size 1. Another woman, was suspended today, Because your principal, Confiscated her diary, because it contains, some violent poetry. That's a violation of privacy. I agree, so the question remains. What story do you want to tell, as a group? So, what's the next assignment? That's simple. Most revolutions start innocently enough. Taking a seat on a bus, throwing a tea party. I class assignment. Where are you going? To change the world. Really? Do you want help? Because I changed the world last Tuesday. I might be able to give you some tips or something? OK, uh, how about a ride home? I just parked over there. You like my film idea? Yeah. I mean, it was heavy stuff, but--- Clitoral Mutilation. Right! Yeah, it's hard to believe that we live in the same world that stuff like that, actually happens. Hey! Is it true you had a threesome with Christina Stephenson and Kim Paige? Well, who started that rumor? 'Cause I don't want you taking me home and then tomorrow find out that I had like An orgy with a bunch of midgets or something. Well, if you do hear that, it won't be from me. It's little people. You can take me home. I--- I've never been on a bike before! Is it new? Yeah! Looks like it. Why don't you drop me off a block away. My Mom would kill me if she saw me on a bike. Well, then. It's a good thing I don't own a bike. OK, I'm a dork. Yeah, you are. Yeah. Just thought you wouldn't find out so soon. We are so there. Well, traditionally, the minority student's union has been predominantly African American. Hey! Mr. D encouraged us to make a change, you know? Maybe we could all work together or something. Well, traditionally, the club--- Tradition can kiss my fat Chinese ass. Well, what about Chuck? He's just a weird looking white boy. Um, excuse me Walanda. I don't know if you noticed, but I'm a bit on the heavy side. Although more and more Americans are struggling with their weight, We're still, a very frowned upon minority. And he dresses like he's blind. He's a double WAMY. Oh, aren't you gonna ask why I'm eligible? Boy, please. You're so gay, Shear dresses up like you. Alright, you guys are in. Cool! We are the cougars. The blue, and the gold. Nice work ladies, good. We're on our way, to the top, we can't be stopped. Come on down, shush up, help me! H, S, one more: B. H, S The best! Yeah, alright! I think we're ready for our big game. Now we know what we want to wear to cheer camp, and it wasn't dressed like a Kelly deflowered. Hey, isn't this your house? Mm hmm. Are you... gonna get out? I was just waiting to see something. Wait, to see what? If your reputation is deserved. See ya in class. Are you sure you want to wear your hair like this to the talent show, baby? Why not? Well, you kind of look like Burney from room 222. A fine black man. Hear that? Wohh, wore his hair natural just like this. In my day, we all wore our hair like this. That's how it should me, natural. Not like all those fake weebs, trying to look like we're on friends, or something. Oh, my god! Monica your hair is looking so good! Thanks Phoebs, yours too. It's so straight and blonde. Please. Well, you know something? Sister Maya would be proud. right on. I know she would. Oh, Guess what I went shopping for today? What? You're supposed to guess, that's why I said: "Guess". So guess. Katie, you can play this game too. I don't know. What? New pair of: "Who Haz". Sergeant, please don't do that at the table. It's improper. Lawn jockeys. What this house needs, is a really good lawn jockeys. Come on kid, let's go! Enough exploding zombies. It's family game night, and you know what that means. Yahtzee? Come on, sweetie. You better get amped up. You gotta put some heart into it. Yahtzee, Yahtzee! Yeah, yeah, Yahtzee!! Come on, let's go. Alright, just uh. Wait 'till I'm done this game. No, I What happened to that little boy? That little boy used to love his Daddy. He used to love to play games with his Daddy. Alright. Where should she going--- Dad. Alright, I'd still do it, but just the save game. Computers are good for two things kid. Internet porn, And um, Well, internet porn. Phh. So, come on. Don't make me kiss you again. Alright. Yahtzee. OK, what do you mean, your stupid AV club isn't doing a making of the prom video? I have zero tolerance for that. Well, what am Ii supposed to do? They do it every year, but--- Mr. D. wants something more, I, I don't know: Like, socially concious or something. Ah, no no no no no no no. I have zero tolerance for that. You promised us all, right Ashley? Yeah, you did Katy, you did. And I'm with Katy, I have zero tolerance for that. Ladies? Uniforms! If the shirts would get any shorter they would be headbands. So, unless you want me changing your uniforms to HazMat suits, I would suggest, covering the thighs, hm? Ashley, my office. Now. Cheerleading probation. Hmm, big deal... Yeah, Ashley. Screw officer Weller. I once got fired from my job as a CIT at summer camp, For getting caught while my boyfriend was sliding-in the third. Spot on, Kelly. Big deal, Ashley. I mean, consider yourself lucky. Hey Isn't that Monica's locker? It was her locker. She was suspended for pinning condoms to her dress. Monica is coming back though, isn't she? Principal Weller won't allow her to attend classes without an apology. What, is she not gonna apologize? Monica is the founder of this school's celibacy society. She didn't pass out condoms to incite a school-wide orgy. She cares about people! She shouldn't have to apologize for that. Would you adopt me? Uh, Mam, Could I interview you for the school newspaper? Um. And did you say you were Monica's... Mother? Really? Her, her her... Mother? I, I mean: sister I could understand, but Mother? Very good, young man. Sure. I'll do your interview. Look, if you want to get published, Find another story. How about the history of the Pom-pom? That was my idea. Mr. Mumsford. 3 girls in our senior class are pregnant. Yet, our school doesn't pass out condoms. Charlett, I want the paper, to be supportive of principal Weller! Besides, Matt is already... working on a story about the talent show, and--- Holiday hoopla. Are you kidding me? You stood up for what you believe in. And that's what counts. Thanks, Mom. Tofu. He is... suck a jerk. And the newspaper is just a joke. And the sucky thing is, we can't do anything about it. Well, I wouldn't say that. You just have to be... More creative. Like how? Well... I protest against fur by staging a naked demonstration in central park. Like I said, there's nothing we can do about it. Look, If you need me to drop trial for the cause, just let me know. Tim spears? Two words. "Dance", "Belt". Thank you. Ahh Hold in, my boy. One word. Accent. When performing Shakespeare, Once must always use, the Queen's English. "To be, or not to be." Riddle be that, You can hear me so much more the merrier, when I used an accent. Yes? Elo ho ho my lord. Smashing, good show. I'm so sick of this school. I hear you, no one listens to us. Well, what are you gonna do about it? This administration is one long skidmark. Lovely, Emily. What? I'm not the one wearing a home-made banana hammock. You asked what we're gonna do about it? Get creative. What are you thinking? I think she's writing an editorial for tonight's performance. Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to Holiday Hoopla, Booker High! Take it away! 4 minutes, 8.5 seconds. A new breath holding record. Stella! 4 minutes, 8.5 seconds. A new breath holding record. Stella! Stella!! It's just a game between two lost souls. Still I love him to fill my soul. That's why he's here, I don't know his name. But we play, The singing. Thus began the dance, of cock sure love! Love! Good luck. You're gonna need it to beat that number. Our performer is: The performance will be a little piece from "Hamlet". By master William Shakespeare. To be, Or not to be. That is the question. No, No, no. That isn't the question. The question, Is rather two questions, Whether to pick up arms, against a sea of adults, who urge you to close your eyes, and trust us. Last year, The government sent out 117 million dollars, to schools who promised not to teach safe sex, and promote abstinence only. I hope you like the new football field, Would you like to know what it cost? It cost the sexual education of your children, it caused 2 student abortions. Because this school would rather buy a new jumbotron, Than hand out a condom. To die. To sleep. To sleep. While a girl, is suspended from school, for writing down her thoughts. Creativity, cut off at the neck. To sleep! While our very own, Principal Weller, Wins an election, and becomes state superintendent. So she can force her medieval policies, On the rest of this state's students. That's enough. That, is, enough. Mr.--- wake up! Stop, right now. Emily, lights! lights! Don't vote Weller. Stop this now! I chose not to be. Oh my God! Call 911! Oh, my God. Do something! Oh, oh jeez. Awesome. Hold it! Yeah, hold it. Totally awesome. Oh, he's so dark. He's so mysterious. Who cares? Walanda didn't even get to perform. Was there a lot of blood? Seriously, a lot? Like, a Pint? So terrible. Mother. Holden was trying to make a point. He was trying to incite an otherwise apathetic student body. Why bother? I could have walked away with that trophy. You still can. That was not comedy. I know comedy, and that was not comedy. I wasn't trying to be funny. I was trying to say something. You spoke to me Holden. Me too. I man, I liked when you slit your wrist, and whoosh! Blowing over the stage, and crap like that. It rock! Thank you. So much Mr. Stratton, but I'll be taking it from here. And I must say, that with the exception of a surprise visit from Mr. Andy Couffman, it was your best effort to date. Well, thank you, Principal Weller. I felt so good about--- thank you so much. Mr. Stratton. As for you, Holden Donovan. I'll see you in my office tomorrow morning first thing. Oh, Good news. You don't have to waste your time doing homework. Nor will this institution ever allow such actions on school grounds. Be it on the athletic field, in a classroom, or during any creative performance. Immediate, and disciplinary action will be taken by the school authority. As a result of any infraction to this rule. OK. I think it's all pretty clear. No fake killing yourself in the big game. Ever if it's under 2 minutes, we're down 3 and we got no time outs? Garcia, if we're down 3 with no time outs, you better really kill yourself, hombre. In a classroom or during any creative performance. Immediate and strict disciplinary action will be taken by the school authority as a result of any infraction to this rule. Mrs. Jordan, I just wanted to say that if it looks like I fall down dead, It's probably just low blood sugar. We're on a low-carb diet. It could happen. So guys, immediate and strict disciplinary action will be taken by the school authority as a result of any infraction to this rule. What do you all think about that? I don't know, it's the rule? Yes, it's "the rule". But so is 'i' before 'e' except after 'c'. That's the rule too, but that doesn't stop you clowns from ignoring it half the time. What do you think about the rule? Um, It goes against our first amendment rights? Oh, what? What? You speak heresy, young lady? Yes, sure. There are gross, transgressions against the constitution here. But, this is English class, so. We'll focal purely on the grammatical dissection of the piece. Anybody? Uh, you can't modify a noun with a noun. That's very good, Charles. Good catch, but that is the least of this thing's problems. Anyone else? A lot of people worked very hard on this show and it was ruined. Demolished, like a wrecking ball, in the side of The Belasco Theater. A lot of you, say you want to be professional actors and actresses. Well, I've been around, hmm? I know a thing or two about that! I have Harvey Fierstein's autograph. Would Harvey Fierstein have slit his gay wrist? No! He wouldn't. I know I have his autograph. I get it. I do. You're the dark boy. You were the one, that all the impressionable, young girls fall for. And, to be perfectly honest, in my impressionable young girl days, I might have fallen for you too. But we grow up. We learn about real life. Holden, I love, and value education. I do. And what you did last night was a horrific display of egotistical self-indulgence that had an extremely Negative effect on the student body. Actually, the students seemed to like it. The only people put off, were the adults. I respectfully agree to disagree. And seeing, as you broke several codes of conduct, It's within my authority to suspend you for such a reckless act. What I did wasn't reckless. Hmm. If you really love, and care about education, take a look around this school. In room 218, we have an anatomy teacher who lives with his Mom, has never seen a naked body, including his own. In room 324, we have a European history teacher with sweaty armpit stains. Who has never stepped foot outside of this city. What's your point. My point, is that the side effect of education should not be death, by boredom and mediocrity. You're nothing but a politician. Holden--- Yes? Forget the suspension. You're expelled. Oh, Holden. One more thing. Don't think I don't know where these ideas came from. Children don't just act like this in a vacuum. Good luck with this. Socks! I can't believe she expelled somebody, for the best acting performance, since the original "Dawn Of The Dead". Holden, I feel like it's my fault. Are you kidding me, I performed it. It's as much my fault as it is anybody else's. Wait wait, this was definitely better than the original Friday the 13th. I mean, Kevin Baker was acting on a whole other level. Alright, I'm gonna get going. I'm coming with you. No, no no. You have class. Besides, you can do more here on campus than with me. OK? I have to say, I though it was fantastic. Yeah. No, I though the blood was way off. It looked too fake. Please, Sheila. I was backstage with you, you almost wet your pants in fear. He definitely shouldn't have got expelled. No, it was honestly like a really good performance. OK, OK, OK. Guys, guys, guys. I know you're upset. I hear you. And there are a lot of other students in the shcool that feel the same way, but the question is, What can you do about it. Exactly, what can we do about it. Lawrence. What is your film about? WAM. Right, what else? Well, it's a musical retrospective. That's the subject. What is it about? George Michael's fall from grace? Politically. Why did you make it? I like WAM. The thing I love about your film, is it's political slam. Now, clearly, it's a statement about your feelings being gay? And being targeted by the police, and by the public, and by society at large, right? Lawrence is gay? Charlotte, you're video, talked to me. Razor Blades. All instruments used in the barbaric procedure of clitoral mutilation. Usually, these items are unsanitized before being used to rip out the young girl's genitalia. This fowl mouth, little hippy girl is turning this in as a school project? This is not art. I don't know who Mr. Drucker thinks he is. You intelligently make a statement. To stir people up, to make some change. Right? But let me ask you this: How many women do you personally know, who have had their clitorises mutilated? Um... None. And how many women do you know, that know women who have had their clitorises mutilated? None. Now, that's a cause worth fighting for, But it might be better to fight for a cause that's closer to home. Not better, different. Now, I hear you guys screaming up and down about what happened to Holden, but I'm saying to you: do something about it! Mr. D? I think the word is: "clitori". Oh, stop it. Thank you very much Mr.--- It's disgraceful. Donna, I once performed in a staged reading of Oliver Stone's "Platoon", Where we deleted all the expletives, it worked! I was, Willem Dafoe. I can play weird-looking people too. Yes, thank you. How long are we gonna wait for him? No, he'll be here. He said 20:00 Can I get you guys anything? Herbal tea? Cookies? Bullhorn? Handcuffs? You told your Mom we're protesting? No... my Mom is cool. She's--- demonstrated against like three wars, and against like, other junk. Thanks, Honey. I'm glad I made such an impact. What did you use handcuffs for? Well, in 82 a bunch of us used handcuffs, to chain ourselves around animal testing centers. Ah, and they're not bad to use in the sack, either. Mom, Gross! I'm sorry honey, I forgot. You still think I'm a virgin. Hey Holden, my Mom was just leaving. No... You should stay. Totally, she's way cool. Way? Way. I'd bet she's even fine with Holden trying to stoop her Daughter. Shut up Veronica, yeah, shut up Mary. Uh, Mrs. Pratt, Holden. Please ignore my friends, I'm not I mean, it's not really, I Right, yeah. If you're the first teenage boy I ever met, and I completely believe you. OK uh, why don't we just all stop this, and talk about why we're all here. We need to stop what is being done to us. Being done to us, don't you mean: "being done to you"? You don't see us expelled. Your right. If anybody here is worried about getting expelled, you should probably leave now. Anybody? Talk to us! This administration claims they want to challenge our way of thinking. Yet, any time we rise to that challenge, if it doesn't support Weller's bid to become grand pooba of all schools, then--- She wants us gone. Do as I say, not as I do. Eat shit, smile about it! Excuse me. Fuck it. We all in? Alright, let's do it. I'm in. Yeah. What's the plan? Ah, that's where we run into a slight hiccup. No plan! What kind of plan is that? Alright, it's not exactly a plan. It's more like a work in progress. God, I'm so with you. I'm like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and you're Winston Churchill. Remember, it was Victor Hugo who said, freedom in art, freedom in society. And it's a double good which all consistent and logical minds must strive. Was that really Chuck Meagan? Nah, Chuck just got into Yale. Really action. You can't judge a book by it's cover. What does my book cover look like? Sweet. And... innocent. You've picked up the wrong book. So, what do you want to do? Do you want to see a movie? Michael row the boat ashore, Halleluya. Michael row--- Guatemala. The United States army, overthrew a democratically elected president, Then what? 200,000 civilians are killed. 1963-1975 4 million dead in South-East Asia. Billions given to Saddam Hussein to kill Iranians. 1983, Iran, is secretly given weapons by the white house, to kill Iraqis. Look it up, it's in your history book. Oh, yeah. My mistake. It's not! He was amazing, huh? What the hell is he doing teaching high-school English? I don't know, but he obviously has made pretty powerful enemies with his documentary. How did you find this one? I worked in a video store last summer, stumbled onto it one day. Do you take your salary movies? Pretty much, yeah. What's your favorite? Uh, impossible question. I means, it is "The Godfather", Better than "American Beauty" is uh, is "Pulp Fiction" any better than "All About Eve"? Besides, If I chose one then, the others might get jealous. Say anything. I've never seen this one. Are you kidding me? It's brilliant. One of my favorite on-screen kisses of all time. What makes it so great? It's, buried in the movie. The last like 5 seconds it's partially blurred by something in the foreground. It's so simple it just, Ione Skye and John Cusack. Kissing in the rain. You know, all bunned up. Her hair is, Tied back in a ponytail. It's all grey and dark, but there's something, magical about it, it's like their first kiss. And their last kiss, all wrapped in one. I, I, I don't like them. You gotta see it. Show me. I want you. I want you. I want you. So bad. Honey, I want you. She is good to me. There's nothing that she doesn't see. She knows where I would like to be. It doesn't matter if I was--- I want you. I want you. I want you. So bad. When I want you. I want you. I like that movie. Me too. What other movies do you like? I got it. I got, I got a plan! Ugh, you couldn't have waited a little longer to come up with the plan? I, uh. I mean, I guess. I could use a little more time to formulate my plan. Oh, my God. Who wrote this? This is so... I don't know, what's the word? Oh yeah. Stupid! Supporting that nut-job Holden Donovan who faked suicide? I wish that weirdo would've just done it. He's creepy. Like Mansen. Charles or Marilyn, take or pick a creepo. Spot on, Kelly. Now, this is what I'm talking about. This is what Brother Martin, and Brother Malcolm and Sister Maya were talking about. Who's sister Maya? Oh, well, she was in Mulan Ruje. This be a definite call to action against--- The powers. There. Hope, success, I don't know you guys, I think Holden is... kind of moving. I think he's sexy. Ewwwwwww Well, whoever wrote this manifesto should be expelled. You're right, Ed. I say we stamp out freedom of speech, Wherever, and whenever possible--- Oh, please Jane. Freedom of speech was brought about to make people think. That suicide attempt on Holiday Hoopla only made people want to vomit. Nah, I don't know Kemp. I'd say people are thinking. Look, we're still arguing about it 4 days later. Does anybody know what this "12|15" means? We, the silence screamers of Booker High, draw from the words of our forefathers to unite our fellow students. We call on you, to through down your textbooks, your slide rules, your latest computer games. For now is the time to come out behind your clicks and classmates and stand up to be recognized Uhgh, these cheeky kids are 'F'ing me. Get in here! What is it, do you know who's responsible for this? What "No"? Why are you standing there? Go bring me his head now! What?! What is it? What is it boy? Did Timmy fall down a well? Go! God, you're useless. Useless! Jesus. The first paragraph of any article we're ever writing, must always The 5 'W's: Who, what Where, why, and uhhh... and when. Why? Because--- Hustle up! Come on, get up there! Reitzer, climb the rope! Use your legs! Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely, and more temperate. Rough winds, do shake the--- Darling, buds of May. And summer's leafs. Excuse me? This is not the interval All the way up, come on. It's time. Where are you going? You can't just leave class, get back here. It's a fascinating predicament. I mean, put yourself in his shoes. You're a journalist, You're approached by people you don't know. They, they call you Kennith... Not your name. And--- hey guys? And that is why we all have to fight for a change at this school. Suspension! For promoting safe sex. Suspension, for writing poetry in a personal journal. Suspension, for the performance of an art peace? What's next? Suspension for bad fashion sense? Weller is on her way. Come on. She's mad. Since when was the bill of rights, rewritten to exclude the students at Booker High School? And Weller in 7, Six,--- Now! Five. 4, You will fail yourselves, you'll fail your fellow journalists. You'll fail your editor, and you will What, what is going on? I have to go number 2. Ew. What, you needed a possy? OK, OK. So... who can tell me which date, the bill of rights was added to your constitution? December 15th 1791 Very good, Very good. December. 15th 17, 90 On the wall, the crapper. He, somebody wrote there little manifesto on the wall of the crapper. Damn, Son. I like you kids today. And then Charlotte Pratt, who's really cool. Not the weird fish groupy tied eyed hippie chick I though she was. Said, what's next? Suspension for bad fashion sense? Of course, you know, Kelly and Ashley didn't participate. They said that they were cheer leaders, and not cheer followers. But you know what? I think it's really cool. Mom, did... did you ever protest anything? Sergeant, refresh my memory. Did the soy sauce come out of my flowered print dress? I dropped it off at the Chinese laundry. I figured, they'd know how to get out their own sauce. Sergeant, the drink. What is it, by the way? Um. I asked if you ever protested anything? haha I remember she burned her bra. Well,--- But, that lasted only about a week and a day, since she complained, of a chafed nipple. I'm really happy things went well today. But I have to warn you, if your principal calls me, I may have to tell her to kiss my ass. OK. Goodnight. Goodnight. I love you. love you. Oh, and by the way, I want Holden heading home in about 10 minutes. What? Do I really have to open the closet door? Good night, Mrs. Pratt. Good night, Holden. Sorry. It was worth a shot. You were amazing today. I should get going. Did I mention that, I should get going? Yes, you did metion that. Hi! Let me show you the way. Well, you're being paranoid. Who has it out for you? Weller is serious this time. I can get fired. I don't know, Will. Maybe you should ease up for a while. And... if I do, what does that say to these kids? Look, Will. I'm here for you. But keep in mind, it's hard to fight the good fight, when you're not playing in the game. Hey, You do want to play in the game, don't you? Only if you're gonna put on that cheerleading outfit again. Again? Let me rip it off of you, Why, if it isn't Nelson Mandela. Hey, Mr. D. Where have you been? Hiding. The school board meeting was tonight, and I was the first order of business. You, I hear you negotiated yourself out of a suspension into an expulsion? Yeah, you can't win a war without some casualties, right? How did your parents take the expulsion? I'll let you know when they stop fighting long enough to hear about it. You just hang tight. I'm gonna see Weller tomorrow about getting you back in school. We're getting things back to normal. I don't want things to get back to normal. If they do, what was the point of getting kicked out in the first place? The point wasn't to get kicked out. The point was to be heard. And you were. What about you. Were you heard? I saw your films, they were amazing. And now you're in the middle of nowhere, teaching a bunch of high school kids? Why bother? I came here to ask you, to give a kid some slack. And you suggest, a leave of absence? Well, it might do you some good. Look, I can't have you inciting these children anymore, it's getting dangerous. Donna, Donna. Why can't you listen to these kids? They are not dangerous, they are smart! They are passionate. They're They are idealistic. Are you telling me that I don't listen to my students? I'm trying to create an environment here, where the students who want to learn, can! There's no room--- For, for what? Thought? For being heard? That is all these kids want! They are seeking answers to what they see as inherent hypocrisy in the system! High school is not a democracy, OK? These kids, need mentors, who are going to push them to improve their reading and writing skills. Who are going to encourage them to achieve higher test scores--- I, I agree. I agree, and that is exactly what I'm doing. No, no no no no. What you were doing was encouraging them to revolt. And you're giving them a reason to. I have no choice, but to let you go. Well then, we're just gonna have to see what the union says about that. Well, I'm happy, to reconsider your suspension. If you'll reconsider your teaching style. I'd rather be fired. Mary Poppins. Greece one. Greece two. Sergeant Pepper's lonely hearts club banned. The movie. What do all these films have in common, hm? OK. Comedy, fun, entertainment. OK, Mr. Drucker might be gone, but that doesn't mean that this AV class, isn't going to kick butt. And make the best, darn making of the prom video, ever! I don't think so. Ohhh, looks like she told you, Red beard. Come on you guys. Lucky that man didn't mention the--- We're outta here. Is anyone up for a corn dog? The Greek philosopher Heraclitus once wrote there is nothing permanent except change. And as you walk through life as students, and later on as adults, Hopefully, this idea, will help you to deal the with many twists and turns that life delivers you. On one other note, today's special is Shepard's Pie Not Salisbury Steak as featured on the lunchroom menu. So, students. Let's go out there and have a calm, wonderful day. Ben! Ben! Can we wed the GD mircophone fixed? I feel like officiating a piding contest with the state fare. Hi, Ben! Hmm? Get the kids in here. Oh, well. Mm hmm. OK kids, she'll see you now. Hi. Come on in, come in, come in. What can I do for you? Well, Principal Weller, we're all umm, Curious--- At to why Mr. Drucker is no longer working here! Well, Mrs. Pratt. It's not the custom of the Principal, to elucidate the students, as to his or her professional decisions, but, since I do care, for each and every one of you I will share this with you. After reviewing Mr. Drucker's many years of meritorious service to this educational institution, I am of the opinion, that he and I, no longer share, the same philosophies. As to the best way to nurture, and in inspirit young minds. Um, did you just come from an SAT study course, or do you really talk like that? So you just, threw him out? Mr. D. was the best teacher here! Yeah, I think I've had just about enough of this conversation, and look at that? You're all tardy for last period. You can pick up your "Tardy" slips with my assistant on the way out. Umm, Principal Weller? As the resident theater techy, I think I might be able to fix your intercom system. Really, Emily? Well, that would be very helpful. Thank you. Super. Kissass. Brown knows her. Little Betty do good. So, did it work? Like a charm. "Little Betty do good"?! What? I like to improvise. Oh, really? Thank God. 'Cause I thought that was really mean. Are you joking, or do you just look like a moron? Do I really look like a moron? No, Donatela, you're on Mr. Blackwell's list of 10 best dressed. Please, you make Elton John, Circuit 1974 look like Hugo Boss. You know, sometimes your lips move, and I have no idea what your saying. Great so, we're all on for tomorrow? Bring it on! Yeah, let's do it, let's do it. Alright, I'm gonna get going. Oh, what? You can't give us a ride? Yeah Hold, I'm an outlaw. Outlaws don't take the bus. Alright. Who's first? Me. Me. Me. Mm Hmm. And look what in Rose, her head. Ohhh, yeah! I mean I'm just saying. Yaho! She'd had died in the Gulf War. Yeah, he was a medic. But I mean, his death made me want to do something with my life. You know? Inspire people with words, instead of guns. Well, you've inspired me. How about you're parents? Uhhh, not very much like yours. I mean there's uh No "Make love not war" bumper stickers if you know what I mean. I mean, would you like to? Well, Make love. What do you mean? You're serious? I was just wondering why you hadn't asked me yet. I don't know, I was just, I wanted to be, respectful. And, I'm tired of being respected. What are you looking for? Uhh, Holden? I know you're 17, and that's a guy's sexual prime, but--- Come on! It's getting a little bit rediculous, don't you think? Little ambition, aren't we? They're not for us. Then, who are they for? Well, she can't suspend all of us. Can she? And my job here is to mold Each and every one of you into upstanding citizens. I have to say, that I feel you're losing sight of the reason why you are here. This morning's demonstration is disruptive to your education and will not be tolerated. Following the tragedy in this country of 9.11 our federal government instituted the patriot act. Giving the FBI new powers of search and seizure. In the spirit of this act, I will be overseeing our school in much the same way that our government has deemed necessary to oversee our nation. Freedom, is not always an unequivocal right. We must safeguard it Good morning, my formal classmates, and hello you too, Donna. Sorry to interrupt your morning dribble fascinating as it sounded, but as my good buddy Ben Franklin once said, those of us who would sacrifice--- Ben? good freedom for temporary safety, deserve neither to be safe, nor free. I invite you, the students of Booker High, to join us in the fight against the virus that is the current administration. A virus that could spread state-wide, if Donna Weller is elected superintendent. What could possible be wrong with employing a faculty member voter "best teacher of the year", five years in a row. By all of you. Where is he? Find him, now! I invite you, to join us. Donna, we got him. Stand up! Change the world, for we have only begun to fight! We got him. Yeah, this is it. No no. No no, no no no. Lawrence Reitzer, stop it! That, young man, that just earned you a suspension. This has got "front page of the newspaper" written all over it. Look, I said no, and that is final! Why not? 'Cause this is a high school? Ok? will you get real? I am trying to be. But you won't let me. Y, you, you push Charlotte. You push and push some more, and But you won't let me. Y, you, you push Charlotte. You push and push some more, and I have decided to let Erin Robinson take over, as editor in chief. She wrote an absolutely beautiful editorial, urging the Administration of the school to consider adopting school uniforms, and, well, she just hit it out of the park. And I think you might wanna take a page from her book. What book is that? "The idiot's guide to kissing ass"? Wow, You are always "Mrs. Goody Goody". And I'm always the bad guy. I am sick and tired of you, always being so perfect! Well, why don't you straighten-out your life, Tony Scampenino, Ever since you've been hanging out with them stinkpots Freddy and Chicko, You've been no good to me, no how. I know those no good bubs do drugs, I bet you do drugs, Too. Oh, my god... I hate, drug awareness week. I don't know, I've seen better acting in porn. Not that, I like porn. I like porn. Really? Ah ha, joking. OK, wow. New rule: You can't touch me anymore, OK? You hang out with your homies, you smoke pot. You snort cock, you take ecstasy, You mainline heroin. I don't have much time. I'm here to ask you all, to take a second, and look inside yourselves. I do so, in the wake of another, appalling act by You guessed it, our very own Principal Weller. Yeah! It appears yesterday, one of our own was suspended for kissing his partner in the hallway. I'll give you a quick hint, too. I shot this. No, it wasn't any of these people. It appears that our fellow classmate was suspended because he shared the same genitalia as the person he was kissing. Shut him down. Shut that down! Shut the whole building down if you have to, now! In a protest against homophobia I challenge each and every one of you, to find somebody of the same sex, And kiss them. That's gay! That's the point. He's in here somewhere. Find him! We cannot let Principal Weller's homophobia prevail. what reason other than homophobia could she possible have for suspending just Lawrence Reiter and Tim Spears for kissing. Support your fellow classmates. She can't suspend all of us. Kiss away. Come on! What are you guys waiting for? You heard Holden! Come on, you guys! Hey Come on! You and me baby ain't nothing but mammals, so let's do it like they do in the discovery channel. Gonna you and me maybe ain't nothing but Mammals. So let's do it like they do on the discovery channel. That's it, shut off the power right now! I'm not afraid to suspend you, or you. Or, any of you. This is ridiculous. What are you doing? You're on the basketball team. That's it, that's enough. Nice. Hold it! Ben! Where is he? Where is he, find him, now! Do not tell my wife. Hmm. Not gonna. No no no. Baby, you and me are nothing but mammals so let's do it like they do on the discovery channel. Thank you, thank you. Thank you my fellow compatriots. Thank you for making this school, one of free thought. And don't forget to check out our Subtle message at the football game. Go team. Go check the cafeteria. It has been my great pleasure to have the opportunity to work with Holden for 4 years. In that time, he has proven himself, an incredible asset to the students around him. He is a young man with exceptional skills, and unusual sensitivity. I promise that Holden will not disappoint you. We all know what to do? Yes. 10 4. Over. Chuck, what the hell are you wearing? In case we run into any unforeseen danger. Problems can be many, and multi-hued. Alright. Let's do this! Emily, Josh. Are you sure, that this is a good idea? Trust me. So tell me now What do I have to do? To say things that will get through to you. I'll cross my fingers and I'll pray for you. So tell me now Larry, be careful. Owe, God! My muscle. Larry? No, I'm OK. I'll cross my fingers and I'll pray for you To somehow see this site! Call me more convinced. Say there's a way to cure this loneliness. With common sense. This has got "The Towering Inferno" written all over it. So tell me now, what do I have to do. To say things that will get through to you. Lorance! Ahhhhhhh Ahhhhhhhh Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Ahhhhhh Ahhhhhhhh! Oh my god Ahhhhhhh Ahhhhhh So Lorance is gonna be OK? Oh, he's gonna be fine. Except that he'll be burned. You should be more concerned about youreslf right now. How the hell did this happen? I proposed we have a Maluau theme. And Lorance um, had I grass skirt on. On the school football field. You know, you should really do something about that fingerprinting machine it wreaked absolute havoc on my new French manicure. Look at this! I want my Lawyer. This is racism. Sister, I am blacker than you are. This is not, racism. Uncle Tom, No justice, no peace. No justice, no peace! OK OK, hey hey hey. Relax Sweetie, OK? Now, What the hell happened? My name is Charlotte, and I don't appreciate being spoken down to. OK. Charlotte. What the hell happened? And I don't appreciate profanity. Uh, officers. I'll give you an example. It's kind of like, when you were a kid, And your parents said: "Don't play ball in the house". You know? I... never did, but uh, no one ever said anything about don't burn down the high school football field. Ah, I no speak, uh, English. You want spring-roll? Excuse me, you don't speak, any English? Yet, you go to school with all these kids? I'm not buying that. You want a licky licky? Ok, We are playing trick or dare. Lawrence, pick dare. I asked them to spontaneously combust, and I never thought he'd actually do it. Hey, smart ass. You know how much prison time you can get for arson? You hurt your friend. You could be looking at 20 years. Leader of the crew. Yo man, that's awful. You ordered a pizza with your one phone call? Yeah, pepperoni and sausage. Emily, Walanda, and Katie got outta here so fast, they won't be able to get a slice. Uh, that's more for me. Why, who did you call? Nobody. I'm staying in jail out of protest. Unlike Holden, who is staying here because he's an ass. Just thought I should call Mr. D. I kind of screwed things up with Mr. D. I kind of screwed up a lot of things. Charlotte, you think you can get me that girl's number? She's kind of hot. I expect an apology out of you. I told already, I'm sorry. But not to me. Thank you. Uh, I don't know what to say. I about, "I'm not gonna jump bail"? That was my retirement money. Yeah, no problem. So, I here you negotiated yourself out of a job and into unemployment? Just another casualty of war, I guess. Look, I want to say something to you. And I know your parents don't care enough to say. What you did last night was stupid. It was dangerous. And it sure as hell isn't what I've been talking to you about. Ha, What I said last week, I, I. I didn't Mean. I'm sorry, it's just--- Just growing up. I know, I know the drill. I've been doing this a long time. Maybe you were right. Maybe too long. So I've decided that I'm gonna make a new documentary. Yeah? Mm hmm. What is the subject? I just bailed him out. Shut up. Are you serious. It's not how I taught you. Like that, you got that? You got that? You guys, I think you're looking at this all wrong. We, should be granted early acceptance into every college in the country. I know Howard would welcome me with open arms. We're making a difference. Will Howard welcome me with open arms? And me? Sure, you know? You could use a couple tokens. May I chime in? Lawrence, your awake! Baby, you look like a pig, on a spit, but I have never seen a prettier sight. Well, thanks, Walanda. Can one of your doll me up, like Meryl Streep dolled up to Shirley MaClaine in "Postcards From The Edge"? That's why I'm here, Darling. Ohh... Now. Enough of this whaling around like some pregnant Heffer going into labor, it's boring, and no one cares. Now, isn't the time to give up. Now is the time, to fight this thing. Yes, we screwed up, big-time. Bigger than big time, biggest time. Which is exactly why we have to make it right. And the election for State School Superintendent is only two days way. And we have to step up to the plate, inbound the ball, and get a touchdown! Yeah, he's right! Let's do this thing! Just one other thing: Yeah? Was... prison hot? That's great, it starts with an earthquake, Birds and snakes, an airplane. And Lenny Bruce is not afraid. Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn. World serves it's own needs, don't misserve your own needs. Feed it up a knock, speed, grunt, no, strength. The ladder starts to clatter with a fear of height, down, height. Wire in a fire, represent the seven games. And the government for hiring and a combat site Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the furies, Breathing down your neck. Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped. Look at that low plane, fine, then. Uh-oh, overflow, population, common group. But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself.

Like totally--- No, seriously. I'd be happy to outline our specific issues with Principal Weller if you'd like. Oh, I'm a cheerleader. She's totally against the entire student union. This isn't the same, as when it was when you were in school. We're dealing with some real issues here. Where do I live? I'm actually head of the Celibacy Society. That's like, really gross. We're sick of her trying to ruin our lives. Thanks for your support. Great, thanks. Thanks for your support. Thank you very much. Great, thanks. And may the Lord be with you. This past week, students at Booker High School, Organized a massive campaign to challenge their Principal, Donna Weller's bid for School Superintendent. As the polling reveals. Given the startling upset, one can make a case, that apathy among teens has been greatly exaggerated. This is only the latest in a string of events. Of civil disobedience that have caught the attention of the city. A wake-up call, against the alleged overbearing policies of this school administration. All the kids in America, Listen up. This is a time to stand up and say: "shut up". To break the rules, that were first intended for fools. What ever happened to: "Living and letting live"? Is there nothing better to do but screw our kids? Must be that we walk through our lives like blind sheep. 'Cause I'm almost mama's daddy, said: "Do it, it must be neat". Something smells funny, whenever it's what's in need, rules change like it's nothing. It's bullshit, listen to this hypocrite, it makes me sick. This is the world that I have to deal with? I'm gonna live my life how I think I should. Call me bad 'cause I never ever felt so good. What people think, I could care less. 'Cause only I know what is best. is: time to do what you want to. Don't listen, we'll make all you fools. And who was responsible? Actually, it was Lawrence who came through for all of us. I just needed to get a little butch, for a sec. My inspiration I pretended I was Bob Fosse, in all that jazz. And... try to get all rough and tumble while wearing it And your Principal? Lost the election. Quit her job. And we're all back at school. Felons, but luckily back at school. As well as some nice recommendations, helped open up the doors to all the right colleges. What can we say? Couldn't have done it without you. My name is Linessa Riube. I'm 17 years old, I go to Osceola High School is Kissimmee, Florida. My name is Nataley Leon, I'm 16, I go to John Adams High School. I'm Rachel Guan, I'm 15 years old, and last October I was expelled from school for a story I wrote. I wore this t-shirt to school that said: "Boy was a lesbian". My math teacher saw my shirt. And he, he's laughing at it. And he's like: "Is it appropriate?" I decided to take a bunch of condoms and tape them onto my shirt. 5 days suspension. Go home! This story was about a girl who fell asleep in class. And dreamed she shot a math teacher. And then when she was running from the building, she was shot by the school resource officer. We were having spirit weekend. For one of the spirit days it was Halloween, so I was like: "Ohhh!". I have a lot of friend, and we're all teenagers. We all know what we do. I'm not gonna lie. Some girl wore a shirt to school with like, someone ripping a bat's head off, nobody say anything to her, but they see the word "lesbian", everybody gets offended. I got suspended for it. The though of me getting in trouble for writing something, never even crossed my mind. My Mom came to the school but, she wasn't so polite about it. She came to school with news cameras. Fox, 5, there was all like, these reporters there. The next day, I came home from school, and it was just swamped by media. It was crazy. Then everyone went crazy. I got channel 13, The Orlando Sentinel. Sharon Osbourne called me. My parents were pretty mad, but not at me. They were really mad at the school. My Mother ironed this shirt for me, the morning that I wore it. So, my Mom's just 110%, she's behind me. "Venessa, why'd you do this?" Promoting safe sex! Why are you promoting safe sex? 'Cause my Mom has HIV! Hmm What happened to me was really wrong. And I shouldn't be punished for writing. America is supposed to be a free country, and people should be allowed to express themselves. If you gay, you gay. You know? If you're straight, you're straight. You just get on with your day of school. You wake up human, you go to sleep human. We all the same. We, we all Same blood, you know? We all... beat the same heart. My Mom has--- no, had HIV before she died. And, I refuse to let my friends wield a way, to the same disease. I'm, sure there were a lot of other little cases that popped up that were similar to that, I know. Whenever we came home and checked the answering machine, there were always people telling us about things that happened to them. Hey, you, you look pretty big up there on the big screen. Are you kidding me? With that giant zit in the middle of my forehead? I didn't see your zit. How could you not see it, it was the size of a house. I couldn't take my eyes off your smile. I've got two words for you, Dorky So, what's it like to kiss a movie star? I don't know, you tell me. There is actually one screen kiss I didn't tell you about. Oh, really? Yeah, watch, puddle. you're in the army now. Jane Wyman and Regis Toomey shared the longest screen kiss in filming history. How long was it? I, don't think I should tell you. I don't think you'd handle it. Is that a challenge? What, how long was it? Three minutes, and five seconds. Are you ready? Ready for what? To rewrite a little bit of, film history. You wanna call it, or should I? I'll do it. Action. Just in-case your not wearing a watch, that's 3 minutes, and 10 seconds. A new record. And provided we don't sneeze, or pass out from lack of oxygen, We'll make it just shy of 6 minutes. So did we change the world? If not, It's still early in the week.
