See, I told you. Don't rap, huh, Raquel? Well, what are we gonna do now? Just sit here all night? We're gonna walk until we find a gas station. Let's go. No. What do you mean, no? I can't let you stay here by yourself. I'll be just fine. All right. Dingy car. Paco! You son of a bitch! Paco, let's get out of here. Did you say something, taco? Hey man, you almost hit us. Darn, I'm sorry about that, I didn't see you. Your skin kind of blends in with the darkness. Yeah, it's the Invisible Man. I hear him rapping, but I don't see him. Oh look, he's out there somewhere. Hey, what did he say? I don't know. I don't understand that garbage. Speak American, you ignorant foreigner. Yeah, knock off the Mescan, pepper belly. You bastards! Oh, what he said. That wetback just bought it. No brown trash is gonna talk to me like that. Get him! I'm gonna show you your place, spic. And then after that... Maybe I'll show your girlfriend a thing or two. I'm gonna bust this beaner up but good now. Hold him up! Get the hell out of here, Raquel! Run! Run! Stop it! Stop it. Help! Somebody help! Shut her up! Help! No! No! No, no! Somebody help! Help! Get out of there, slob. Now you tune in on me, chick... If either you or that greaseball tell the cops what we did, I'll come back and I'll finish the job on both of ya. And that's a promise. That's one good Mescan. Hey, you got a joint, Din-Din? Yeah. Give it here. Well, yeah, but it's my last one, Bruce. Let's have it, fatso. Hey, Bruce, you didn't have to call me that. I would have given it to you. You know that. Now, why did you... All right, now come on, just cool it, will ya, Din-Din? Just cool it. Okay, that's it. Well, come on now, everything's groovy. Come on. What's gonna happen, man? I gotta go up before some stinking judge in 30 days. Aw, man, you'll probably get off with probation. Yeah, first offense. With a gringo judge? I'll probably get the electric chair. What are the cops going to do to Bruce? Do to Bruce? Hey, get serious, man. Bruce says he was out on a date, and the girl backed his story. What about Raquel? Can't the cops... The cops ain't gonna do nothin'. Nothin'. But fill out forms and sit on their fat butts. You want to know why? Because a Mexican girl got raped. But let it happen to a precious gringo girl and they're gonna tear the place apart. But Raquel says she wasn't raped. Well, I know different. You think she wants everybody talking and looking at her like she's some kind of a freak? Hey, Paco... When are we gonna get that filthy... We'll get him. But not yet. When the cops get off my back. Hey, miss, excuse me. Excuse me. Is the high school down this way? Straight ahead, two blocks. Thanks a lot. Say, are you on your way to school? Do you want a ride? Thanks, I'll walk. Aw, come on, I won't bite you. Besides, I might get lost. I just transferred here from San Diego. My name's Tony Perez. Hi, I'm Janet Harrison. Hey, isn't that Janet? Mmm. Yeah. What's that with her, man? Is that a greaser she's with? Sure the hell is. Well, what's the matter with her, Bruce? Is she wigged out? Shut up. Hi, Janet, who's your friend? Oh, well, let me introduce myself. My name's Bruce Tabor. I'm Tony Perez. And this is Emmet. Buenos dias, senor. Yeah, well, that's okay. I speak English. Wow, how about that. Yeah, and I bet he can even read and write, too. Say, is there something you guys are trying to say? Come on. Thanks for all the help. Hey, you. Yeah? You new here, huh? Yeah, that's right. Well, around here we don't mess with gringos. Or their girls. You remember that, huh? I mean, you don't want to be known as a gringo-lover, do you? All right, Rodriguez, spit out the gum. Gum? I ain't got no gum. I say you do. Now out with it. Look. No gum. You swallowed it. Okay, Rodriguez, just don't make any plans for after school. And sit up in that chair. You're always pickin' on him. What was that, Gonzalez? Nothing. You keep Rodriguez company. Anybody want to make it a threesome? Bruce. You and your friends hold it down back there. Why'd you come out to this nowhere place, anyway? Well, we got relatives here and well, there was a death in the family. My old man had to take over. Just don't rock the boat and you'll make out. Say, uh, Johnny, I'll see you later. Uncool, man. Very uncool. Oh, hi, Tony. Janet. Okay if I sit down? Sure. See you later, Janet. Look at that, will ya? Hey, who does that taco-bender think he is? We gonna do something? Yeah, something. C'mon. Not that way, dumb-dumb. Hey, look who's coming. Yeah. It's our old buddy, Rodriguez. Hey, man, are you still smoking them funny-looking cigarettes? Hey, come on. Come on. Please stop this. This guy's crazy. Come on, somebody stop this. Hey, man, cool it, here comes a teacher. Just a minute, Rodriguez. What's going on? Hey, let go, huh? I ain't done nothing. Let's just find out. All right, what happened? Nothing, I was trying to get to my class on time. What'd you see, McCann? It was all over before I got here. Did Rodriguez swing on you? No, it was my fault. Yes, sir, I wasn't watching where I was going and I bumped right into him. I guess I hit him pretty hard. All right, everybody back to your classes. Hold it, Rodriguez. You got yourself another hour after school. What? You know the rules against running in the halls. Hi, what you doing? What's it look like? I'm trimming a hedge. I can see that, but why? I'm a representative from Better Homes and Gardens, okay? Don't they have gardeners around here to do that sort of thing? Yeah, you and me. Hmm. Does the school pay ya? If they did, I'd be a millionaire. Yesterday I was a janitor, tomorrow I'll probably be a trashman. Lots of room for advancement. After you, Simms... You fink! Yeah, that guy is really something else. What's he teach around this establishment, anyway? Algebra and history. - He's a football coach, too. - Hmm. Lot of Mexicans on the football team? A few. None on the first string. Yeah, that figures. Yeah. It's the same with the student council, the newspaper and the social clubs. What are you doing about it? We don't care, man, we all leave town after high school anyway. Yeah. I'm gonna make it to L.A. Why don't you go to the principal about this teacher Simms and all this other crap? Why don't you keep out of my business? Look, man, I appreciate what you did for me, but I fight my own battles with the gringos. Understand? Okay then, shove off. I don't see why you guys put up with this. Well, not all the teachers are like Simms. Some of them are pretty good heads. So are some of the white kids. Hey, listen, you got anything going tonight? No, nothing. Ramon's old man has a place out on Highway 5 where we all get together. The Magic Cactus. Why don't you come on out? Okay. I might just do that. Groovy. I'll see you later.

I've made other plans for tonight. What do you mean other plans? A date? With who? That's none of your business. Come on now, Janet, now give. Is it that taco you've been seeing? You don't own me, I can go out with anyone I want to. Now, let go of me. You stay away from him, you hear? You go to hell, Bruce Tabor. You know, I sure have been getting some bad vibes from Bruce Tabor. I feel like I'm horning in on something. It really bugs me the way he acts. You know, boys are afraid to ask me for a date. You seem to be the only one who isn't. He's pretty well off, isn't he? His dad owns just about everything around here. And my dad works for him. Oh, I see. Then your parents really like Brucey-baby, huh? Oh, yes. How about you? He's weird. And he's got a lot of hang-ups, too. Someday he's gonna have to step into his father's place and he's afraid. So he has to cover up all the time with a big front. Yeah. You know, it's kinda sad. He could have a lot going for him. Mmm, thank you. Hey, man, you drive like a Mescan! It is a Mescan. See, guys? I told you, it's our good buddy Perez. Beaners all look the same to me. Yeah, you gotta look real close. Hey, you know, you're right. Yeah. It's old senor. How you doing there, senor? You look a little pale, Perez. Now, you pick up on what I'm saying, okay? Now, this little town isn't like the big city. We do things different. We don't mess around with Mexican broads and Mexicans don't, I repeat, don't mess around with our white girls. It just isn't done. Yeah, that's a no-no. Now, you're new here, Perez. So I'm gonna give you another chance. Just don't make another mistake. See you around, Perez. You think old senor will behave himself? I think he'll fall in line, just like all the rest of them. It's weird, man. You know Bruce and all them really prejudiced guys... Well, when we was in elementary school, we always used to play together and go to each other's houses and everybody got along groovy. Yeah, it changes when you get older. What was that group you were telling us about from San Diego? Just a group of Mexican students like us. We all got together and we put the squeeze on the school, for equal rights. How did they work, Tony? You guys serious about this? You're darn right, Tony. Us and lots of others, man. Okay, I'll tell you. We'll have to get together tonight. Bitchin'. Hey, let's meet at my old man's place. It doesn't open until 8:00. Good. And Raquel, see if you can get Paco to come, too. Why him? Now, use your head, Johnny. If we can reach the hotheads like Paco and keep 'em in line, we'll have a much better chance. Just see what you can do, okay? He'll be there. See ya. So they got smart. The kids in San Diego realized you gotta have power. But you gotta get that power the right way. Let me put it this way. What's wrong with this school? What do you want? Everything the other kids got. Yeah. Okay. But do you actually think they're gonna walk up to you and say, "Hey, Ramon, come on and be our student body president." Wouldn't be such a bad idea. No, but baby, that's not gonna happen, because first, prejudiced people don't change by themselves. And secondly, people who aren't prejudiced, man, they don't see nothing that goes on. But what we have to do is bring it to their attention. I get a lot of that. Every day I get to stay after school for extra attention. Yeah, well, that's because you screw around in gangs doin' nothin' but hatin' white kids and... They hate ya back. If I'm not mistaken, now half of this school is Mexican, right? And the school has elections, right? But, but no Mexicans ever get elected, right? Now, something there is damned wrong. Well, we don't have a chance, so we don't vote. Aw, damn it, Johnny, if you don't vote you're as stupid as they say you are. You got, you got nothing to complain about. Hey, watch it, man. You're one of us. That's right, I'm one of you. But I'm not gonna take this crap the way you do. So what do you suggest? We work, we don't drop out, but we get active in this school. Now, let's say that we had a list of grievances to lay on the principal. He probably doesn't realize half the problems that go on. So, number one, who's got a complaint? I got a couple, man. Coach Simms has gotta be canned. Okay, let's talk about that. Okay, Madera. Let's have it. Up here with the paper. It's school property now. Do you want to do a little work after school? Now, go back to your seat and watch it. You understand? Move. Okay, Harris. Get the lead out. Hi, Coach. How we doin'? The team looks pretty good. When I see hardworking boys like that, it restores my faith in you young people. Huh? Oh, uh, yeah. Yeah, Coach. I just hope none of my boys are going to that meeting this evening. Meeting? Which one? Why, I thought you boys knew everything that went on around here. You mean I'm one up on you? Well, we've been kinda busy late, Coach. Aw, Now, I can't believe you never heard of it. The one at the Magic Cactus? Tonight? I guess you boys don't have too many Mexican friends, at that, do you? Mexicans? No, not many. That must be why. They holdin' some kinda fiesta tonight, Coach? I only wish they were. It's just a downright shame, that's all. Well, what is? Some of the boys are gettin' together and holdin' some sort of radical meetin', anti-American. Like they do in the big cities. That's too bad. I imagine you boys know who put 'em up to it, too. No, no we don't Coach, who? Well, we never had this sort of trouble before. So it figures, must be a newcomer. I've seen this kind of thing happen. I only hope something is done about it before it's gone too far. Hank, do you need handles on that football to hold it? Oh, uh, Coach. Did you say The Magic Cactus? Yeah. Let's go, guys. Ramon is passing among you a list of grievances that we're gonna lay on Principal Wilson. One, stop unjust punishment. Two, end discrimination and extracurricular activities and the student council by means of a new voting system. Three, that Coach Simms be fired. Hey, man... What is it? They ain't gonna pay no attention to this crap. You gotta back it up with some kind of action. You're right. If by Wednesday he doesn't talk to us, we're gonna walk out. Walk out? Just like a strike. We gonna set up picket lines and we're gonna take as many Mexican kids as we can with us. He'll expel us. Now, he can't expel half the student body. If we do strike, we've gotta stick together and we've got to follow the rules that we make. This will be our uniform. Now, everybody has to get one of these. If you can't find one, just take a khaki work shirt and you can dye it green. Hey, that's my old man's car over there. Hey, come on back! Now, do you see what those gringos are like? I say we... We what? We blow up all the gringo cars we can find? Damn right. I said no violence, Paco. Now, can't you see that's what they want us to do? Well, I ain't gonna disappoint 'em. Paco! Now look, man, your way hasn't worked yet. At least give mine a chance, huh? Paco. Let's go back inside. Hey, Janet! Hey, Janet! Hey, Janet. What's the rush? What's wrong? Tony. Yeah? Tony, I don't think we'd better see each other anymore. What? Please, don't make me explain. Janet! What's happening? You just can't brush me off. Tony, the things I've been hearing about you today... What have you heard? That you're some kind of radical. You're staring riots. And you believe that? Well, you are starting a group, aren't you? Yeah sure, Janet, but it's just a group to get the Mexican students equal rights. Equal rights? Wow, you really are way out, aren't you? Now, listen to me, Janet... You just want to make trouble. Trouble? The trouble is here. Why don't you wake up? No, Tony. I don't want to get involved with you or any group. I'm sorry. Most of us are here. Let's go. What do you figure they're up to? Well, maybe they're gonna fight the Alamo over again. Well... What's all this about? What are you supposed to be, a bunch of junior storm troopers? Mr. Wilson, we're a committee representing the Mexican-American students and we come to... All right, fellas. Now I want you to listen to me. I want you to take off these costumes. You go home now and change. Mr. Wilson... I mean right now. Go home. This is our petition, sir. We'd like to discuss it with you. Have you got these boys names, Miss Emerson? Yes sir, they gave me their names the first thing. Our names are also on this petition, sir. Okay, boys, now listen to me. This isn't the way we do things around here. You don't disrupt school and go parading around in uniforms. Excuse me, sir, but we're not disrupting the school. If you have any complaints, you submit them to the student council. One of our demands is that the student council be dissolved. Demands? You don't make any demands around here. Would you please read this and discuss it with us, sir? I don't discuss anything with a gang of hoodlums. All right. Then we'll leave this with you. And if we haven't heard from you by Wednesday, all of the Mexican-American students are gonna walk out of your school. Walk out? You take the thing, get out! Please, Mr. Wilson, talk to us about this. Not now or any time. Just get out! Okay, But if your school is disrupted, it won't be our fault. Tony Perez. So, that's what's happened. We're banished. Exiled. For how long? Two weeks suspension. So what are you gonna do now? There's nothing to do. We have to wait and see what happens Wednesday. I thought I made it clear. I don't back down in the face of any threats from a bunch of juvenile delinquents. And that's your final word? The matter's closed. And if you boys aren't off the school grounds in two minutes, I'll change that suspension to permanent expulsion. Find the unit leaders and pass the word. We walk. And old Wilson's gonna blow his mind. Now, our next move is to get the other students to join us. What do you want the gringos for? This is supposed to be for Mexicans. Next you gonna want that bastard Bruce to join. That's right. If it would help our cause. The more students out of classes, the sooner the school is gonna listen to our grievances. You are sick, man, you know that? You sound like you're planning a church picnic. All this talk about "bring a gringo home to dinner." Those people are out to get us. Wake up! Why don't you wake up, Paco? Can't you see they're not all as bad as Bruce? Shove it, man! You're going to learn and I'm gonna be right there to say, "I told you so!" Come on, let's split. No, Paco, I'm staying. Hi, Raquel. May I talk to you a minute? Well, sure. Come on in. Thank you. Sit down. Well, what's up? Well, I'd like to talk to you about our group. You know, Tony and the guys in the green shirts. I've already told Tony I don't want to have anything to do with your group. We need your help, Janet. My help? Why? Well, you're popular with all the kids, and you're not a Mexican. If this thing's gonna make it, we need all the support we can get. There's been enough trouble already. You want more? We don't start it. It's Bruce who starts it. Tony's trying to stop the fighting. But he can't do it alone. And if you just sit there and don't do anything, then you're as guilty as Bruce. I don't have anything to do with Bruce. And I don't want to have anything to do with your group. I'm sorry, Raquel, I have homework to do. Maybe you do too much homework, Janet. You don't know anything that goes on, do you? You think that nice, little smile of yours is gonna protect you from the world. Do you know what Bruce did to Paco? I know Paco's been in a lot of fights. You call it a "fight" when four gringo boys gang up on one boy and beat him up? And that's not all that happened, Janet. They planted a stick of marijuana on him and now he's on a two-year probation. Oh, come on now. Bruce may be bad but he wouldn't... Bad, hell! Now you listen to me and you listen good! You haven't believed one word that I've said to you so far, have you? Well, maybe you'd like to know something I've told nobody else. That night four of your gringo friends caught me in a car and raped me. Did you hear, Janet? They raped me! And I couldn't even tell Paco about it. And I couldn't call the police because Bruce threatened me. Oh God, I'm so ashamed! Please, Raquel, don't cry. It doesn't matter now. Just that... This movement is so important. I don't want Paco to get into any more trouble. Please help us, Janet. Oh, hell, now we got the ball team on our back. Keep cool. Hi, Tony. Doug. I, um, brought some of the guys from the team down to sign your thing. Thanks a lot, Doug. Thank Janet, it's her idea. Janet? I wonder if old Wilson'll expel the whole bunch of them. It'd be kind of nice, wouldn't it? Yeah, and the locker rooms would smell a lot better, too. Hey, did you see the look on Simms' face when that whole bunch of tacos walked out of his class yesterday? How about when he saw those picket signs? Morning, Coach. Morning, boys. Oh, Coach. What do you think about all this? Oh, no good will come of it. Well, we just wanted you to know, Coach, that we're behind you all the way. No matter what they say. Thanks, boys. But it looks like some of our students are joining 'em. Well, there's always a couple of bleeding hearts in these things. I remember... Oh, uh... About five years ago, we had the same kind of school trouble in San Benoit. Oh, really? What happened? Folks tried ignoring 'em at first. And when they found out they couldn't, they started giving what they wanted. Only instead of being satisfied, they wanted more and more. Finally wound up rioting. I bet the police put an end to that, huh? No. The police couldn't do a thing. You mean they let those lousy wetbacks... Those Mexicans got away with it? For a while. Then a group of citizens took charge. Well, what could citizens do that the police couldn't? You boys ever been in the rocks and run up against a nest of rattlesnakes? Yeah, couple of times. What did you do? Run. I stomp on their heads. And did you ever notice how the tails keep rattling for a while longer? Sound just as mean. But they're not. And then they stop. I gotta be going, boys. Yeah, later, Coach. Everybody! Give me your attention! Your attention, please! Any minute now that 8:00 bell is gonna ring. You may not like this, but you're gonna have to stand up and be counted. Right now! Those classrooms must be empty. Stand with us. Stand with us, please! Don't go in! Aw, hell, if they don't have to go to school, why should we? You gotta stop these kids. And now even the others are joining them. But... So all you can do is arrest them and turn them loose. Then do it. You're the sheriff. What do you mean, this is "just a school problem?" Now, listen to me, Todd... Okay, that's it for today. We'll see you all at 8:00 tomorrow morning. Hey, Tony, here comes trouble, man! Girls, get in the car. Stay there. Follow me. Everybody stay together. Come on, now, easy. It's gonna be okay. Easy, baby. Now, Janet, listen to me. It's all over now. Oh, Paco! You need a doctor. No. But that son of a bitch Bruce will. ♪ Other people tell me what I'm gonna say ♪ And I might have cared until the other day ♪ Once you get inside my wall ♪ You're likely to find out I'm not there at all ♪ I'm disappearing very quickly now ♪ Trying to stay but I don't know how ♪ Nothing's worse than a mind that's shut ♪ Something is there but I don't know what ♪ Children's light is going out of style ♪ Lasting only for a little while ♪ Music is life and chaos is death ♪ Both lie there as a single breath ♪ Sight and sound all lie to me ♪ Here is just what I want to see ♪ Looking back at where we've lain ♪ Remembering our joyous pain ♪ Now I am a non-entity ♪ Fading into infinity ♪ Walking around... Hey, Bruce? Bruce, I gotta talk to you. Later, man, later. Bruce, really, it's important. Later, will ya, Din-Din? Bruce, please! Please, man. All right. Okay, now make it fast, Din-Din, and this better be good. Bruce, you gotta lend me your car. It's a matter of life and death! Me, lend you my car? You gotta be kidding. Well, what is it now, you got a hot one? This kid's all warmed up and raring to go. And if you don't lend me your car, I'll kill myself. All right, now where is this matter of life and death? How the hell did you work that out? She likes short men. I'm tempted to lend you the car just to see how you make out. Oh, please, Bruce, any favor you want, you got it. Honest. Okay. Now, the keys are in the car. Bring it back in one piece. And put gas in the tank. Thanks! Hey! Later, man. What do you mean, later? Now, man, now. You're gonna get her. But we're gonna have a little fun with him first. Come on, bring her along with us. Tie him good now. I don't want him to fall off. What are you going to do, Paco? You wait and see, Luis. Hey, fat boy, you awake? Good. 'Cause I don't want you to miss nothin'. Put her in the car. Argh! Oh, God! Oh, please, help me! Get me off! Please! Get me off! Paco! Shut up! Oh, help! Help, please! Please help me! That guy's gonna call the cops. We gotta get out of here and loose these two. Please, please! Bring me the girl. You didn't see nothin' and you don't know nothin'. Do you? You say anything to the cops and this is gonna play with your face! Next time, it'll be blood. Oh, God. Oh, God. Tony! Hey, man. Johnny. What's happening? We got troubles, buddy. Big ones. What? Come on. Tell him, Luis. Come on, spit it out. Hey, Tony, what's happening? Get back in that car, Paco. You guys, too. Go home, take off those shirts. What are you talking about, man? About what you did to Din-Din and that girl. Who told you about that? You're through, all of ya. Split! Okay. All right, it's true. But did you get the whole story, man? About you and Raquel? Yeah, Paco. I got the whole story. So, my girl gettin' raped and me gettin' nearly beat to death don't mean nothin' to you, huh? That's history, man. Okay. If I see any of you in those green shirts again, you're gonna hear from me. Now, clear out. You... You're gonna pay for that, man. I'm gonna organize another group. First I'm gonna stomp the gringos. Then, baby, I'm gonna stomp you! I'm gonna be watching you, Paco. And so help me God, if you do anything and try and queer this, I'll cut your lousy heart out. You understand? Tony, Tony, come on, man. Okay. You guys stay away from this school until this is over. Now get the hell out of here. Hey. Where are we going? To the bowling alley. Look, Paco, it's much too nice a night to go to a bowling alley. All right, then let's... Let's go to the loop. Come on, save it until we get there, huh? Bruce, we gotta get out of here! Yeah. Let's split. Thing's don't look too good, Tony. Yeah, the gringo kids are afraid and they're pulling out. And now we're losing a lot of our own. After what happened to Paco, you can't blame them. Well, don't they know that was an accident? Do you really believe that? Hey, are you just gonna stare only? Well, I'm sorry, Janet. I'm just beat, that's all. It's this movement. All the trouble it's caused. Tony. It's not your fault. Sure it is, Janet. If I had been like all the others and taken the crap... But, no. No, I have to stand up and show everybody I'm just good as they are. Or even better. Tony. I don't know if I started the Green Shirts to help the Mexicans or I started them to help myself. Well, whatever the reason, in a couple of days it'll all be over. My parents and a lot of others are putting pressure on Mr. Wilson. He'll give in. He has to. Hey, I thought we came out here to go swimming? Come on. Hey, Bruce. Get out! Come on! Come on! Get them out of there! Your old man owns this place. You get them out. All right. All right, I will. Are we safe? Yeah, for right now. They can't get in here, but we can't get out either. It's what we call a Mexican standoff. Hey, are you sure you know how to work that? Yeah, I played around with it all summer. Now, Emmet, you go hold that rope and guide the blade. Jerry, you be ready to spot 'em when they get out. Now don't... Don't get near the blade because once it drops, I can't stop it. Anytime you two are ready, come on out! All right! This is game time, baby! Now, do you want to come out now, or do I drop the bomb? We're coming out. Tony! Oh, stop! You guys take her inside and tie her up. I'll watch him. You gonna kill us, the way you did Paco and Raquel? Kill you? Oh no, I'm not gonna make you a martyr, man. I'm keepin' you alive. You're gonna be an example to any more wetbacks who want to step out of line. What about Janet? She's gonna have to learn, too. Look, what, after I've had my fun, nobody, not even a Mexican's gonna want to look at her again. You scummy bastard! Leave her alone! She belongs to me! Hey, man, what happened? Where'd the taco go? I want that mother... Well, just about everybody's with us. I can't believe Wilson hasn't given in yet. It's still early, Tony. Hey, buddy! Doug. Boy, am I glad to see you! Say, are the other guys comin'? Most of them are already here, man! Hey, uh, you sure can use a gang today, can't you? Have you heard anything from Wilson yet? Nope. But if this don't do it, nothing will. I'll grab a sign and do some walkin'. Well, Janet, we might as well hang it up after today. Tony! Give me your attention, please! Give me your attention, please! If you will send your representatives to my office, I will meet with them and discuss your grievances. I don't make you any promises other than I will listen to you. I don't know whether or not we can resolve anything. But, I will listen. We did it man, we did it! All right, Johnny. That's great! Congratulations, buddy! Thank you. Thanks for all your help, man! Well, we've only just started, but I guess we're on our way, huh? Hey, Tony, was it worth all the hassle? You're damn right.
