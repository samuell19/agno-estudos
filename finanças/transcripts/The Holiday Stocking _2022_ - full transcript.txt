Hark! The harold angels sing. Glory to the newborn king. Peace on Earth and mercy mild. God and sinners reconciled. Joy for all ye nations rise... Our family was extremely close knit. We were always together. And because our last name was Holiday, we felt like Christmas was created just for us. Hey, mama's song is playing. It's time! Time for the stocking! Robert, stop yelling! Mama said we can look for the stocking when her song came on. I mean, did you all hear me? It's time! The neighbors can hear you! Yup, that's me. Our father died in a car accident. I mean, Mom never remarried and in many ways, I felt like the man of the house. That looks great, Cricket. Thanks, Mom. Oh, this just might be your calling. It's perfect. I want to work with you at your own bakery one day. Well, how much fun would that be? Cricket, look. It's snowing. Guess that means an angel's getting its wings. Ma! Go. Start searching before your brother's tonsils fall out. My grandfathers on both sides were pastors. And my parents met at church. They were big into mission work. My sisters and I, were not. So, in the weeks leading up to Christmas, my parents made us play a game that we call the holiday stocking game. Hey, I found it. I get the first guess. Robert, look. We'd search for the holiday stocking, reach inside, and pull out the holiday riddle. Hey Chris. Stop. Give it. Mom? Let her read it. Riddle number one: In December, you can catch this easily, cannot throw it. If you guessed the riddle, you got to choose the good deed. Five searches, five riddles, five good deeds done as a family. Robert, do you know it? I do. A cold. Very nice. What would you like to do? Let's buy some coats from the thrift store and hand them out to the homeless. It's a great idea, honey. No fair, Mom. She just wants to go shopping. Don't blame me for having the fastest brain in the family. You look tired, mommy. Well, that's because I've been up baking since 5:00 AM. I don't like you working so hard. No, it's fine. I will do anything to make sure that my babies have the perfect Christmas. Come here, kids. Come on. As much as I want you three to have the presents you want, never forget what your father always said, the most important gifts at Christmas are the things that money can't buy. We would still complain about volunteering, but once we were doing it. It was fun and it made mama so happy to see us giving back as a family. So what exactly is all of this stuff? Oh, this box? Yeah. Is a key part of my plan, Sarial. Your plan? Robert you transitioned three weeks ago. You've completed your orientation. I would think you'd be excited to finally ascend to Heaven. Yeah, but you say that so calmly. This whole thing is still just strange to me. I mean, look at this. Why would they use this picture? What they doing with this picture? I think it looks nice. Now, back to this plan. Well, you said it's best to enter Heaven with no regrets and I still have one major one that... I'd like to make it right. I mean, my sisters they've been estranged. I mean, it got worse after our mom died. I mean, they didn't even speak to each other at my funeral. And I really regret that I never made a better effort to mend our family. And now your plan has something to do with this dusty box? Yes. Yes. The Holiday Stocking game. It always brought us together. And if I can get them to play, it just might stir up some good old memories, you know. And maybe they'll remember how important family really is. Well, you know what they say, make plans and watch God laugh. Does he? Does he what? You know, does he laugh? You'll see. Well, this decision is above my prayer grade What's that? But you snap your finger... OK. You have 12 days. Why only 12 days? 12 tribes, 12 disciples, 12 Days of Christmas. My boss has a thing for the number 12. But what if I'm not able to bring them together in that time? Well, then your sister's fate may be that they remain estranged, and you'll have to live with that for the rest of, well, eternity. I'm sorry. No, I can't let that be true. No, I know I can get them back together. Any ideas how you'll get them to play this stocking game? Well no, I mean no. Not yet. I mean, I got 12 days. So you're saying your plan isn't well thought out? No. I'm saying, I might need a little help. Well, first things first. Obviously, you're dead. So you can't just walk up to your sisters in this body. So we'll have to change your appearance. What? Hey. What do you mean changed my appearance? Are you ready? What? Give me a second. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Even my voice is different. My sisters will never recognize me. As long as you're wearing this pendant, you'll remain visible to the living. That way you can at least communicate with them. OK. Right? Robert meet RJ. That's your new name. RJ. I like it. Can people see you too? When I want them to. Wait. OK. OK. This is going to work. Don't forget the rules. You'll appear as a regular human and can touch and move things. But your sisters will not recognize you, and you cannot tell them who you are. Got it. How will I find you? Oh. A flip phone? Seriously? It may look old school, but it's got everything you need in there, plus you have angel intuition. Good luck. 12 days. Got it. Thank you. RJ. Spelled out snowflakes falling, the magic in the air. It was sounds of silver... How do I look? Dani Holiday, You look amazing. You look like a runway model. Hey. Thank you, bestie. You're gorgeous. Thank you. Well, I guess when you have one of the most successful Black owned advertising firms in Chicago, you need to look the part. Once we secure our private equity funding, our firm will not only be known in Chicago, we're going national, baby. You know, I'm excited, but I don't want to jinx it. That's why I'm your VP. I spoke to Ben and he feels confident that that deal will close by Christmas. Don't worry. In the meantime, we're going to every Christmas party, taking all the pictures, and making sure Chicago knows what Black excellence looks like. Hey, we might even find a man. Oh. Come on down. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas Oh, that must be the driver. Hi, you're not the driver. Dani. Yes? How can I help you? Yes. Yes, I'm sorry. I'm RJ. I'm working with your brother's estate. Oh. How did you know where I live? Everything was in your brother's paperwork. Here. This is for you. Can you meet me tomorrow morning? The details are inside. No, wait, wait. What is this about? This is his Christmas present. He wanted to do this in person, but obviously God had other plans. He made me promise that I'd see it through. Please, read the card. Gia! I'm leaving! Try to clean up before your mom gets home! OK. Dad! Hey, you. Hey. I was just heading out. I got a delivery in Tulsa by morning. Well, I'm glad I caught you. Are you going to be home for Christmas? Yes. It's just a seven day run. So I'll be back next week, and I'll be here until New Year. All right. Well, be safe. OK. Love you. Love you too OK. Oh. Gia, can you come downstairs? Hey, Mom. Really? I thought you were going to clean up the house today. What happened? I'll do it now. Hey, can I go sledding with Gabby tomorrow? I really wanted us to do that as a family. I'd rather go with friends. Here. This was stuck on the door earlier. Dear Marlow, I'm RJ, Robert's executive assistant. Though he's transitioned, he left me special instructions to deliver his final Christmas present. This was very important to him. Therefore, I hope you will meet me tomorrow at noon. The tree at Christmas Market for more details. Theresa? I don't know if I'm feeling up to going out. Angels we have heard on high. Sweetly singing o'er Sorry. I'm late. I was afraid no one would show up. What's that? I haven't seen this stocking in years. Where did you get this? Well, it was in a box of things Robert left for you and Marlow. Well, where's the box? Well, he wants both of you to participate in the Holiday Stocking game, before I hand over the box. So you're holding our things hostage? No, not at all. I promise to give you everything afterwards. It was important to him that you and your sister restart the stocking family tradition. My sister? Yes. Is Marlow coming? Probably not. Perhaps if you talk to her, she'll come around. I don't think that's going to happen. Friends of Chicago is the charity you'll be helping. Robert insisted. I'd love for you to still participate. I'm sorry. I really don't have time. Oh, but I do want to get that box. Sure. Thanks Please reconsider. Here you are. Two dozen Christmas tree cookies. One winter wonderland coconut cake. Thank you. Enjoy. I can start that cake order, if you want to go home early. No, I got it. You can handle inventory. Hi. Can I help you? Yes, these all look so, so good. Thank you. Wow. I'll have a reindeer brownie, please. All right. I'm RJ. I work with your brother's estate. Did you get my card? The mystery card? Yes. Yeah. I've just been busy with orders. I see that. Mom. Excuse me? Um, is that your mom? Yeah, this was her shop. We worked side by side for many years. Brownies on the house. Thank you, but it's important that you hear me out. I feel like... Look, Robert and I, we really didn't speak that often. I can't imagine what business he would have with me. Robert had that all this time? Please, it was his last wish. Like I said, I'm really busy. OK. Well, thank you for your time. Enjoy. Hey. Where did you come from? Don't you worry about that. Hey. Stop. What are you doing? Seeing if you have another trick up your sleeve, because baby sis is not going for it. You saw that? I see everything. OK. Well, I have another plan. So don't worry. Ooh, brownies. You know what the best thing about being an angel is? You never gain weight. Oh. Good morning, Ben. OK. Please tell us that you have good news for us. Not quite. My client was committed to investing, until she looked at your profile and saw that you have no community initiatives or charity partnerships. She never said that was a requirement and we've had many meetings. Technically, it's not, but if she's investing millions into your company, you have to align with her principles and she's big on philanthropy. Is she backing out of the deal? I have to be honest with you. She's wavering. OK. Ben, You know that we're anticipating this investment to grow our business. Look, I want your company to get this funding. If you've done any charity work or community service get it in front of me and I'll see what I can do. OK. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks Oh. Oh, Wow. What are we going to do? I do not know. We've worked so hard for this. I mean, we've won awards, we've retained fortune 100 clients. I mean, I personally network my Jimmy Choos off. This cannot go down like this. I agree, but do you have anything to give to Ben? No. Me either. But I do know where I could get some. It's time to wake up everybody across the world and sing the longest time for Christmas. Can I have your attention? Yes. Time to laugh and sing around the Christmas... I am so glad you reached back out. Well, I had, I had a change of heart. What about Marlow? I'm going to be doing this on my own. I hope that's OK. Well, Robert really wanted the both of you. Well, I'm sorry. I'm all you got. This isn't exactly how we... I mean, you, play the game. It's fine. Go. These look just like the cards that mama made. Yeah. Robert took the time to get it just right. OK. Riddle one: I'm loud but silent, and I love hanging around Christmas parties. What am I? Tinsel. Right? I mean, It's loud and likes to hang around Christmas. You got it. Right. Have we met before, because it feels like we've met? No. No. No. Of course not. You hungry? I know I am. I was wondering why you had us meet here. Two reasons. The food is great. Really? And the person who owns the place runs the Friends of Chicago. The foundation you're volunteering with. And here he is. Excuse me. Hi. What's up, man? How you doing? Good to see you. You too. You too. I got her. I got you. Thank you. Hi. Hi. I'm Wilson Whitlock. Dani Holiday. I would like to volunteer. OK. Well, it's nice to meet you Ms. Holiday. I look forward to working with you. Welcome to Pat's BBQ. Can I offer you something to eat? I could eat. Great. I get so excited when it snows outside. Get excited, girl. You used to love decorating. I'm never excited at 7:00 AM. Well, I had to get an early start, because I got to get to the shop. And you can come with me, so we can go shopping afterwards. I just thought it might be nice for us to spend some time together I just want to go back to bed. Girl. What's this? Nothing. You can toss it. Ornament, please. I'm trying to figure out this riddle. Is this a work thing? No, when we were kids, we used to play this holiday game with riddles to solve. And your uncle wanted us to keep that Christmas tradition this year. I guess it was in his will. That sounds fun. What do you win? Nothing. You just solve the riddle and then you choose some volunteer work to do. Never mind, that does not sound fun. What kind of game is that? Volunteering is good. My mother, your grandmother, used to make us do that every year around Christmas time. Ugh, I'm so glad we don't do that it. You know, it was actually fun. Because we would fight to solve the riddle. I mean, like fight fight. And once we did, we just chose the volunteer work. And it wasn't so bad. Sounds like torture. So. Mm-hmm. The boots I was telling you about, they're on sale for $300. We should get them today. Are you asking me or telling me? You know what? I think volunteer work would be good for you. No, no, no. I'm asking you. I'm totally asking you. Oh no, honey. It's too late. You know what? I think this is a sign. Yes. It is a sign. We will do this volunteer work, because you need to understand that Christmas is not just about receiving. No. Please don't. Oh, it's done. Done, done, done. Dun, dun, dun, dun. Hey. Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. Your mama got that swag that you got at school Dun, dun dun, dun. Oh yes, honey. You're going to love it. OK. No, no, no. Let's bring it in a little bit more. Nope, that's not it. A little over to the left. OK. Actually that's that right there. Right there. That's perfect. Thank you. Hey. When I suggested you decorate some of the seniors' homes, I didn't expect you to hire a professional crew. Well, I wanted it to look great. I mean, if I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it big. Clearly. So how did you get involved with all this? My dad. He ran a soup kitchen on the south side. Wait, was it on MLK? Yeah. When I was younger, my family and I used to volunteer there all the time. That was our original building, but it burned down. Oh. Pat's is our new headquarters. The foundation's office, in the back. Wow, what a coincidence. Maybe, but I like to think everything happens for a reason. Well, I think they're ready. Great. Ms. Thorton. You ready? Light it up baby. Right there. This is what makes it all worthwhile. Ms. Thorton, she's a widow. She didn't have much family. This means the world to her. It also means the world to me. You know, we used to volunteer all the time when I was a kid. And I'm ashamed to say that it has been a while since I've done anything like this. Well, I hope this isn't the last time I see you. We'll see. All right. Let me grab some of this. OK. Let's grab some. Oh. Oh. Oh. OK. I might have done too much. No, no. It's fine. It's fine. We're going to make this right Ms. Thorton, you just stay right there. You solved the riddle yet? No. Is this volunteering thing going to take all day? Oh, wow. You have gotten so big. Excuse me? I'm sorry, I saw a picture of her at Robert's place. She was little. You bake too? I'll help out here sometimes, but mama likes to be the only one who makes the cakes. OK. We did not figure out the riddle. So we don't have to volunteer? Well, when I was younger and we didn't solve the riddle, we had chores. So you can go sweep the kitchen. Mm-hmm. Auntie Dani! Hey. Look how grown you are. You are beautiful. And girl, look at those lashes. Ooh, if I had those, I wouldn't be wearing these. I didn't know she was coming. Robert wanted his sisters to play the game, again. Together like old times Marlow. Good to see you. Same. Glad to see you're participating. I'm actually doing this for Gia. So she can learn the importance of giving back. Whatever reason brought you both here, I'm glad. So what's next? I've already solved one riddle. Are we going to do five riddles like we used to when we were kids? Wait a minute. What do you mean you already solved one riddle, without me being there? Wow. Marlow, really? Yeah, really. We can make some adjustments. OK. You won't have to search for the stocking and the volunteer assignments can come through the foundation. We already have a riddle. I come bearing gifts as a child's favorite King especially during Christmas. Who am I? Oh, the kings that brought the gifts, right? The frankincense and myrrh. Those would be wise men. Those would be kings. The Mouse King. Oh, like the Nutcracker, right? No, no, no, no. Oh. Instead of doing chores, we should go shopping. Maybe it'll come to us while we're out. You are so much like me. No! You know, I actually have to pick up a dress from a boutique at North Ridge mall. Oh, I think the boots I want are at North Ridge. Let me check. I said no. Is anybody listening to me? Ooh Lord Father, give me the serenity to change the things to accept things I cannot change... OK. Show me those boots. Remember how mama used to display her cakes in the window. She was so proud. So how's the shop doing? Good. You know, I really miss seeing Gia. You can call her anytime. And I hate that we barely talk now. I always wish that I knew how to bake just like you or mama, but I guess it wasn't my thing. I guess taking care of your sick mother wasn't your thing either. I paid for the nurse. I mean, we have been over this 1,000 times. Can we not do this, please? A stoc-king. What? That's the favorite king. A stocking. I would never have gotten that. Ooh, Lil Miss Gia think she's about to get out of volunteering. We will say about that. Hey RJ! I solved it! Stocking! It's a stocking. No. Please don't go sledding without me. That's great news. Yes. What's great news? I spoke to Mrs. Whitlock. She says that tonight they're making meals for the sick and shut in. Oh. Well, I can't cook, but I can call the caterer. I've used this company before and the food is amazing. The whole point of volunteering is to actually volunteer. Well, I can't tonight because I have plans. RJ, we can volunteer tomorrow, right? I'm trying to teach Gia the importance of service and she looks up to you. OK. Well, we can do something now. I'm working now. What happened to us spending time together? We still will. We still have three cards, three riddles, right? You know what? Fine. We'll just do it ourselves. No. Wow. Marlow. Hey, do you, like you usually do, fam. Oh, word? OK. You know what? Fine. Forget it. No No, no, I tried. No wait. Marlow! Wait. Danny. Danny! Marlow! Oh. Me. T, why do you wait until the last minute to find your holiday drip? Because you have a stylist on speed dial. Bam. Yes, girl. The category is gorgeous. Give it. Live it. I have two bloggers who want to interview you about your Christmas traditions, and all of your volunteer work. OK. Any other investor prospects? Not as interested. I'm working on news coverage. OK. Good. In the meantime, sweet talk Ben. I think he likes you. I think Ben likes the sound of his own voice. I'm just looking for someone who cares about more than just himself. Girl, aren't we all. I don't know. I think I might have found someone Who? The guy runs a foundation that I'm volunteering with. T, please. OK. He's tall. He's fine. And he just has this really sweet spirit. I think I might ask him out. Send me his full name and let me do some research. Girl, his family owns a barbecue place and he runs a foundation. What is there to research? Credit score, kids, ex-wives. Just send me his name. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to send you his name. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Welcome to the holiday bake... Before you say anything, I'm sorry. Can I take you out to lunch? Your office may be closed for the holiday, mine is not. Can we just start over? Dani, I don't have time for this. Can you just please leave so I can get back to work? OK. But dad, mom, Robert, they're all gone. And I only have one sister. You're my family. I'm trying, Marlow. It Goes jingle bells, jingle bells, jingling all no the way. Remember when dad used to bring us here to get mom's Christmas presents? No, I was four when he died, remember? Yeah. You know, we used to get hot chocolate and he loved extra marshmallows with just a pinch of cinnamon. You keep saying that you're here because of Gia, but you've got to have a bit of holiday spirit in there somewhere. Well, I'm not miserable, if that's what you're asking. Well, I'll accept that as a yes. Wow. She has grown up so much. Mm-hmm. There was a time when Gia would cry when I left the room. Now, she cries when she has to be with me. It's the same way we were with mom. You were. I was not. I started working at the bakery when I was Gia's age. Mom and I were inseparable. That's true. I mean, you were the closest to her. And you had plenty of opportunities. OK. Look Marlow... Mom, Is that RJ? How did you find us? Um, I guess I have a sixth sense for these things. May I? Of course. Santa Claus was tired and had trouble walking, so he went to a doctor and asked for help. What did the doctor give him? OK. I don't remember these being this hard. If we don't know the answer, can we just get another riddle? No, because then we have to solve both, mom's rules. Well we're not 10. You know, I'll give you some time to think about it, while I see if I can find myself some hot cocoa with extra marshmallows and a pinch of cinnamon. Call me if you figure it out. OK. I'm still trying to figure out how he found us. It's like he's stalking us. And it's weird that he's always wearing the same clothes. He has a flip phone. If that's not suspicious what is? OK I'm going to help at the foundation's neighborhood party. You guys want to come? Sure. We'll be there. Which means I got to get back to the shop and complete an order up. Wow. What's up, homie? That's a whole wave. Yeah, a whole wave. Wow. Come. O come. O come. O come ye faithful, come. O come. O come. O come ye faithful. Come all ye faithful. Joyful and triumphant. O come ye. O come... Any luck finding anything out on RJ? Oh well Robert's offices are closed for the holidays, so no luck on finding out about our mystery man. Hi. Hey. I'm Jamal. I'm Gia. No, he Didn't. So you live around here? No. My mom's into volunteering so she made me come. Did your mom make you come too? No. This is kind of fun. Here. Thanks. Candy cane. He couldn't walk, so he got a candy cane. That's the first one I figured out. It's a riddle contest. Oh cool, I like riddles. [Pbe] Someone looks like they're having a good time tonight. I have an emergency at the shop. It's the last thing I needed. I'm going to have to go. I'm sorry. Gia, grab your coat. We're leaving now? Yes. Well, I can always drop her home, if you want. I mean, unless you need us to come with you now. No. I can handle it. I'll be fine. Just take care of my baby. OK. I'll check on you later. All right. Be careful. She's in the house safely and she actually admitted to me that she had fun. Thank you. I'm actually living inside The Nightmare Before Christmas. I have another order of 100 cupcakes for tomorrow with a broken oven. Oh Wow. Well, I'll ask if you could use the oven at Pat's. Oh, that's a good idea. Yeah, Wilson and his mom are still there. I can always stop back by. Mm-hmm. Now, are you doing this for me or are you doing this for yourself? What do you mean? I saw you and Wilson just looking at each other, gazing into each other's eyes. I think he's really into you. Girl, I can see you smiling through the phone. OK. You know, whatever. I will see if you can use that oven in the morning. And you're welcome, by the way. Goodnight. Baking? Aren't you full of surprises? Oh this is nothing. I actually went to culinary school and worked as a chef for a year. Impressive. Thank you. But my heart is really in philanthropy. Goodnight you two. Goodnight, Ma. Goodnight, Mrs. Whitlock. And Thank you so much for letting my sister use the oven tomorrow. No problem. I hope we'll see you around here more often. Bye, Ma. So what kind of cookies are these? Sugar cookies. Want to know my secret? Sugar? Honey. Oh OK. Yeah. You want to help? You know, baking is not really my thing so... Is frosting your thing? Oh, now that I can do. All right. OK. Watch me work. All right. So what do you do other than not bake? Well, not to toot my own horn, but I do own the largest African-American advertising firm in Chicago. Wait a minute. I've heard of you. You own DHH. I do. We reached out to you guys about doing some pro bono work for our clothing drive. I don't remember that campaign. Because your company doesn't do pro bono work. And we couldn't afford you. Sorry. It's all good. Well, you know the owner now, so feel free to call whenever. Well, now we have a long standing contract with Matlock Advertising. So... Oh. Excuse me. My mom forgot her purse. I'll be right back. OK. Oh, Teresa, girl, perfect timing. Listen, I was thinking we should start doing some more pro bono work. Oh, that's a good idea. We'll partner with a charity and announce it at the top of the year. Oh, I did research on Wilson. What? Why girl? I told you you weren't going to find anything wrong. You didn't find anything wrong did you? No, no, no, he's an absolute saint. You want to get into the pearly gates, he's your guy. But if you want to boost your brand, you need to meet Senator Barrington. He'll be at my New Year's party. I hear you. Do you girl? This holiday giveback will serve its purpose, but are you really trying to scuff up your red bottoms running around BBQ joints and food banks? You are a mogul, my friend. I'll call you back later. That was my crazy friend. She is always joking. Yeah. It's getting late. I think you should probably head on home. Yeah. Good night. Good night. Hey hey. Where's your mom? Oh, she looks exhausted. You know she was at Pat's making cupcakes this morning at 7:00. The store is her life. My mom wanted nothing more than to have her own bake shop and Marlow helped to build that dream. It is her whole world. She's such a perfectionist. It's a little hard to work for. Yeah, she's a lot like our mother. Nah, grandma Sarah was super nice. Grandmothers are always nice to their grandchildren. Candy cane. I still can't believe I got the answer right. Well, you did. So when did the stocking thing start? I've never heard of it before now. What? OK. So in the 70s... You know this part... Mom and dad met at church. And every Christmas they would make stockings and give them to needy families. So this one Christmas my dad, who had a huge crush on my mom, decided to make a holiday stocking. And he planned to put a ring in it and propose. Propose? How old were they? They were only 17. And she wasn't as serious about him. So when my grandfather found out what my father was going to do, he said, "The only thing that better be in that stocking is a riddle, because you a joke." And as punishment, he made them do mission work for the rest of the holiday season. Well, they fell madly in love working side by side, helping out others and they did that for the next three years. And you know, my dad, just to be slick, did give my grandfather that stocking, with a riddle in it, just as he suggested. And when they got married, they decided to make it their family tradition. There are five riddles, because there's five of us. So we each had a chance to win. Why don't we still do it? I guess we all got busy. But thanks to Robert and RJ, here we are now. Did you ever get the tea on RJ? Nothing yet. What's his last name? You know, I don't know. Speak of the devil. Oh Hello, ladies. RJ, do you have Insta? What's your last name? I'll be right back. OK. Give me one sec. So weird. Very. [C] Sarial. Sarial. Sarial. Where are you? RJ, you can't just call me anytime you want. My eternal life keeps me busy. I'm in the middle of bowling a perfect game, again. I need a last name. They're going to look me up. Didn't you think that would happen? No. Can you help me, please? First, operators then phone books, now social media. We never had to deal with any of this back in the day. What's happening? You now have all social platforms. When they look you up, it will look as if you worked with Robert. OK. All right. Good. How do I do some of that magic? You'll learn later. Thank you. Oh, my last name? What is it? Angel. Angel? RJ Angel? Really? Maybe you'll think twice before interrupting me again. RJ. OK. Mom, wake up. I don't like you working so much. Will you please go home and go to bed? If you don't take care of yourself, you'll burn out. I am fine. I'm just happy that the oven is working again. Here comes our mystery man. Hi. RJ, since we helped out at family night last night. Does the count toward riddle three. That's not how it works OK. Well, here comes riddle four. Let's see, when does Christmas come before Thanksgiving? The dictionary. OK. Good. Oh, we should take the clothes from our closets and give it to the women at the Love and Grace women's shelter. Last night, Mrs. Whitlock told me it was one of her charities. Well, that's not quite volunteering. That's because you haven't seen my closet. But it does benefit the foundation. I think it's a great idea. Oh, I'm so proud of you. Let's do it. You know, I don't think it's that great of an idea. Why not? Because number one, my wardrobe's couture. And two, the Whitlock's may not be that fond of me right now. Did Wilson mention me this morning? No. What did you do? It's a long story. Oh, I need to clean up my closet for all the gifts dad's giving me. I'm pretty excited. I'm sure the shelter will be happy to receive whatever you have to give. Now, I must go. Oh, your last name. What is it? Angel. Excuse me? RJ Angel. Well, what does the RJ stand for? It stands for nothing. Just an R and a J. That's all. You OK? Yeah. It's just your eyes. I'm sure we've met before. Maybe, no, I don't think so. I don't think so at all. Have a good one. You know, I can come by your house and help you with your closet tonight, if you like. Oh well, only if you feel like it. I mean, I do want you to get some rest. Oh no. I'm good. Because see, if I don't come help you tonight, it's never going to happen. That part. Oh, I found him. Oh, Yeah. It looks like he did work with Robert for a few years. There's a bunch of pictures of them together. Oh, I put in a call to Robert's assistant, Yolanda, so we'll see what she has to say. So I guess until this evening. Oh girl, stop frowning. Just look at it like Christmas spring cleaning. Thanks, Gia. Oh, my little sugar plum. I'm so happy you found him. You tracked him down like a little hunter. I'm so proud of you. Now you made it weird. OK. Sorry. Thank you. Good job. Ooh, are you giving that away? Are you crazy? Girl, this is vintage couture. Excuse me. Stefon says Hello. He'll be off the road in a couple of days. How are you guys doing? Great. OK, little sis. What's going on? Nothing. It's nothing. I just wish we had more time to spend together, that's all. Well, that happens in the best of marriages. What'd you guys do the last time he came home? He slept. I worked. Well, therein lies the problem. You got to get out. You got to enjoy each other. Date night, right? Go to the movies, go dancing. You got to have fun. I mean, he's out on the road putting in his hours and you always at the shop. I mean, you two are just in a rut. OK. I know what you need. What? A makeover. No. Yes. You will feel sexy. You will feel rejuvenated. When am I going to have time to do all that? I'm pulling 15 hour days. Hire more people. That's not going to happen. I just need to make it through the holiday. OK. Well, I'm just going to go ahead and schedule that makeover. And when Stefon sees you, Oh, he going to be ready to unwrap his Christmas gift. I can hear the bells already just a tinkling, a tinkling. Jingle, jingle, jingle. Well, while you're trying to reignite my fire, what are you going to do about Wilson? Nothing. I mean, he's probably completely insulted and thinks I'm a total snob. What? You think he's right? I will say that I was a little surprised that you even took the time out to do something like this. Something that didn't benefit you OK. Wow. You're making me sound so superficial. Really Marlow? I'm just saying. You are a little bougie. OK. Well, I guess it's better to be a little bougie than to be very stubborn, because I reached out to you several times and you just ignored me. I was busy. You were holding a grudge, like you always have, ever since you were little. And you were being over the top, like you always do for the longest. The longest? Really me? Yeah Marlow, come on now. I mean you... Marlow, you know what? Mm. Mm. I don't want to argue. I just, I want to spend time with my sister, and my niece, my family. Your right. OK. Let me finish scheduling this makeover. Wait, wait, wait. I will do the makeover only if you reach out to Wilson. Text him and ask him what can you do to make things right. OK that's not happening. It's a wrap. He's done. Dani. OK. Fine. Sorry about the other night. What can I do to make it right? OK. I see the dots. He's responding. Oh, they went away. Aww, you really liked this guy. Oh, more dots. He says meet me in Washington Park at 6:00 AM. Hey. What? 6 AM. Why would I do that? Because you want him to see who you really are. Yeah, at brunch. All right. We going put the blankets on this table. Hats and gloves on this other one. OK. I'm here. I'm here. I'm sorry I'm late. I just stopped to get some coffee. OK. Is that Dani Holiday underneath all this? Well, who else is wearing a fur in the park at this time in the morning? No one. All right. There you go. Here you go, brother. There you go. That should keep you warm. Bless you. Hey. Got to say, this coffee hit the spot. Oh, I have some boxes of clothing in the car. For your mother to bring to the women's shelter. Thanks. I really appreciate your help. It's really hard finding volunteers when we start early. I can't imagine why. I mean, my toes are just frozen, that's all. It's probably those high heels. I'm sorry about what my friend said. It was wrong. It was. But she said it, you didn't. I accept your apology So why are you still single? Wow. Is that what we're doing? Well, I got to ask. OK. Well, I guess I haven't found the right person yet. What about you? I just, I guess I haven't found the right person yet either. What a coincidence. You know someone recently told me that everything happens for a reason. They sound pretty smart. Mm. I better finish up. OK. Danny Holiday, would you like to go out with me? I would, Wilson Whitlock. OK. Happy holidays. Thank you. Gia, pull order 542. Hey, Frank. You enjoying the holidays? Yes I am. I'm here to pick up my three dozen pumpkin spice cupcakes. Frank, I don't see that order. Well, I spoke to you about this two days ago remember it was my wife's birthday I want to surprise her. I am so sorry, Frank. We've been really busy around here I must have forgotten but if you come back at 6:00 I will have you ready for you. All right. Gia, take the next order for me. Happy holidays. How may I help you? Hey OK. So look, I know Stefon gets in tonight, but I'm going to have to cancel the salon appointment, and I may not make dinner. I have one of my regulars with a huge order. Absolutely not. You are not canceling. I'll call Nick and I'll tell him that there was an emergency. He'll work it out. And honestly, if you leave now, you can get there and back by 4:00. No. Tracy's not here today. So it's just me and Gia. And you know she cannot handle this place by herself. Fine. I'll come there and work for you. No. You'll put me out of business. OK, look. I bake, kind of. I grew up in the same kitchen you did. You could have fooled me. No, I just can't go. Yes, you can, because I made reservations for you two at Godfrey's, and you do not cancel on that. Come on. Your entire night is planned. Just put yourself first, for once. You deserve this. All right. Fine. I will get the cupcakes started. All you got to do is pull them out the oven. Do not burn my shop down. Don't worry. I won't. OK, bye. Did you notice that I only burned one batch of cookies? You threw them away right? No, I sold them as Cajun Christmas cookies. What? Girl, I'm joking. All right. pucker. Yes. OK. Oh, Stefon is parking. OK. Wow. You look gorgeous. And your hair. I mean, yes, yes. Thank you. Baby, you look incredible. I love you, mama. I love you too. It's that time of the year when the snow drops are falling. The angels are calling. Oh. It's that time of the year. Good morning. Well, good morning. I see that the shop is still standing. Mm-hmm. Oh, you are glowing. I had an amazing time last night. Thank you so much. Stefon kept saying how I look the way I did when he first met me. I love it. Did you ever get a chance to grill RJ? Oh well, I haven't seen him. Well, this stocking was here when I opened up this morning. Hey It's the last one. Oh it's a little bittersweet. It is. You know what? You got this. Me? All right. Let's see. Where did Mr. Snowman take Mrs. Snowwoman for a night out on the town? I remember this one from back in the day. To a snowball. It's so corny. Well, I think we should do one of your favorite things. What's that? Throw a party. Hey. Oh, throw a party. Hey. Oh, for the foundation. Yes, I overheard Wilson saying that he was looking for a sponsor to throw a Christmas party for one of his kid's groups. Oh, OK. Party over here. A party over there. I said a party over here. And a party there. And a party over there. Hey, hey. Tracy. Tracy. Get it, girl. OK. You have got to stop doing that. You look happy. I did it. OK. They finally feel like family again. What's wrong? It's not enough. You still have unfinished business. What do you mean? I repaired my sister's relationship. I haven't seen them this close in a very long time. True, but there's something else. You know, don't you? I have an idea. Can I have a hint? That would be cheating. I'm on your team. It's called an assist. Please. I hope you're good at riddles. Very funny. What if I can't figure it out? Then, this connection between your sisters, might not last. Gently down to the ground. And they'll make their way from the Christmas tree maze. Wow. I cannot believe you pulled all of this off in one day. Yeah. What is this place? It's the House of Mercy. They provide shelter for runaways, abused, and foster kids. That is awesome. Hello, ladies Hi Wilson. You know I was thinking that, maybe we could use some more chairs here. Think there might be some in storage. Want to come With? OK. You know, I might want to volunteer at a place like this someday. Oh, my sweet little gumdrop. OK. Well, now you're making it weird. OK. Sorry. Well, I promise you can go sledding with your friends on Christmas Eve. Thanks. All right. Excuse me, can you tell me where to find... Theresa? I have not seen you in years. Marlow. How are you? What are you doing here? Oh, Wake Up Now Chicago! Is doing a big piece on Dani and "The Holiday Stocking." So we need to get behind the scenes footage. A piece? A profile on her work in the community. Our investor insisted her company needed a charity facelift. I heard she even gave you a makeover. You look amazing by the way. We'll be sure to get you in the story. Does Danny know about this? We came up with it together. Check this out. What do Chicago's advertising queen have inside her holiday stocking? There she is. Get B-roll. Oh, Theresa. What are you doing here? So this was all about publicity? It's not what you're thinking. You know what? I cannot believe this, Dani. Actually I can. Marlow wait. Just listen. No, you did this for yourself, as usual. It was never about family and I fell for it. You have not changed. That is not true. Not all the way. I really wanted us to be a family again. It was never about us Please, just let me explain. Why don't you save the rest of your lives for your little interview. Gia, let's go. But... Now! What I miss? I promise this wasn't just about me. I mean, at first, yes. But then I started having fun and it wasn't about the business. So just talk to her. There is nothing to talk about. I don't ever want to see her again. Honey, it can't be that bad. It is that bad. Just because she was the one in the bakery with mom, doesn't mean she gets to judge me. You know, she thinks she is the only one whose made sacrifices. Is that true? OK. It's true that she helped pay for mom's care, but she was never there. All the money in the world can't replace that. Maybe that's the way she shows her support. Well, I'm done with her. Maybe she was sincere. No, she was exploiting this. And then to drag me in it like I'm some charity case like, Ooh poor homely Marlow. She said that? Probably, behind my back. I just think you need to hear her out. I do too. That party was going to be lit, mom. This is not about you having fun. Really? You're the one who wanted me to see that volunteering was fun. Those were your words. Girl, stop using my words to prove your point. Thanks for ruining my Christmas! You're welcome. I'm going to go check. Yeah, you do that. Oh, my. Ugh. We need to talk. Oh no. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? The game is done. No, this riddle is for me to answer. Here, read it. No, no, no, no, no, honey. I'm not reading anything. None of Robert's people even know who you are. I'm sorry. OK. Well, Robert is sorry. You know what? I'm just going to read this riddle myself. Why did it take the giraffe so long to apologize? I don't know. Why? Because it took him forever to swallow his pride. Robert was going through marriage issues and financial problems. He's sorry he couldn't, didn't prioritize better. Where's all this coming from? Some of his final words to me were that he should have been more involved in taking care of your mother. He felt she only listened to you, which is why he let you handle it all. But that's no excuse. How do know all this? Robert didn't have a lot of friends. So he confided in me. I just hope this brings you some peace. And I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive him, because he truly loves his baby sister, cricket. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Yes, Teresa. I will see you at the studio in the morning. No, no, you don't have to apologize. You didn't do anything. Yeah. OK. I'll see you there. Bye. Ask mother pine in the air. My favorite time of the year. There stringing up lights everywhere. Cups overflowing with cheer. Soft snow is falling and my heart is calling. I'm falling so in love with you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Holla if you want to have a happy holiday with me. Happy holiday. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Happy holiday. You doing OK? Happy holiday. All these years, I thought my sisters were the only ones that fought. I never saw my part in any of this until now. I just can't believe my sisters aren't talking again. I know you want things to be right between them, but at least you can have peace in knowing that you tried. If it takes up until the very last minute, I can't give up. In 48 hours, your 12 days are up. I know. And I am praying for a miracle. Thanks for waiting for me. I wouldn't have it any other way. You know I had to have my man put the star on the tree. Baby, what's wrong? Nothing. I just miss us spending time together as a family. And I wish that Gia would know how much she means to me. I'm sure she does. Hey guys. Hey Gigi. So what time are you going to go sledding with your friends? I don't think I want to go with them anymore. Baby, what's wrong? Nothing. But we haven't gone sledding as a family in years. I thought it might be fun. Wait a minute. You want to come with us? Yes. Can I invite Jamal? Whose Jamal? You sure can. Yes, honey. He better be a snowman! Gia, Who is Jamal? Been talking to. This is going to be so much fun. I'm so happy you decided you wanted to come with us. Now, you're making it weird. OK. I'm sorry. You ready? Yeah. Hey, not so close! She's growing up. I'm not ready. Me either. See you down there. What are you doing here? RJ. How does he even... You know what? Never mind. Have a good time. OK. I should have told you about the publicity. I shouldn't have kept it a secret. I just, I didn't think you'd understand. And I know that I can be selfish at times. But my time with you and Gia had nothing to do with work. Say something. This is the first day off I've had in two years. I just want to enjoy it with my family. Are you serious? Yes. I have been working like crazy to keep mom's shop running. We lost a lot of clients when mom passed. So I've been rebuilding and it's hard to keep all the balls in the air and keep a smile on my face like everything's great. Well, I didn't know. I just figured you wanted to handle it. And that you didn't want me involved. I mean, you always seem like you have everything under control. You are a hard nut to crack, Marlow. Have you met you? All right. I understand why you didn't say anything, but I'm your sister. You should be able to come to me. Yeah, and I'm your sister, and you should be able to come to me when you need help. I promise. I promise to do better. Just so tired of having to be strong all the time. Well, then just let go. You don't have to be anything, but my little sister. Cricket, I love you. I love you too. OK. We going to freeze our faces off. Now, look. I'm still doing that interview tomorrow, but just know that my time with my family had nothing to do with business. We'll be watching. Wait a minute. I think he's looking for you. I'll meet you on the way down. OK. Whoo! Yeah! What are you doing here? RJ. How does he... it doesn't even matter. Thank you for coming. Are you kidding me? This is the highlight of my holiday. Sledding? Sledding with you. You ready? OK. Wait. I'm not going to get hurt, am I? Not if you trust me and hold on tight. Just one more thing for good luck. Yeah, I think we're ready. Let's go. You get on front. So make sure to mention that one of your clients just want to Clio. Some bullet points that say you've been doing the Holiday Stocking since you were a kid. And that community service runs in your family's blood. Are you nervous? I'm not nervous. Do I seem nervous? You seem a little nervous. I'm a little nervous. OK listen. I got this, T. Christmas is upon us and all week long we've been hearing beautiful stories about how Chi-town's best celebrate. With us today is Dani holiday. Owner and CEO of DHH Advertising. She and her company have found unique ways to celebrate. Welcome, Dani. Thank you. So tell me, why have you and DHH Advertising partnered with Friends of Chicago? Well, DHH is all about community service, and during the holidays it's especially important to take time to give back. And I genuinely feel that we should... Well, actually during this time of year it's always important to... That I really want to make it clear that... Actually, I don't want to talk about DHH. Oh, OK. Christmas was a big deal in my family, when I was young. We didn't grow up with a lot, but when my father died, it got even harder. But we played this game, "The Holiday Stocking." We would pull a riddle from a card in a stocking and whoever got the right answer, first, got to choose what volunteer work the family would do. So interesting. So you focused on giving, instead of receiving. Yes, but I haven't been giving in a while. I've been too busy building and maybe even taking. But this holiday, my sister Marlow and I brought back the holiday stocking tradition. And it just opened a part of my heart that I forgot was there. This holiday I realized that spending time with my family and connecting with my community is what's most important to me. So I have decided to step down as president and CEO of DHH. Oh, OK. Yeah, I'm stepping down and I'm leaving the company in the very capable hands of my amazing VP and friend Teresa Fields. So that I can fully devote my time and resources to organizations that really make an impact in our community. And of course, to reconnect with my family. I may even help my sister run her bakery. The holiday bakery for all your baking needs. Well, that is a very powerful statement you shared with us. OK that is my sister right there. That's my sister. In case you didn't know. That's my sister. Thank you. What did you just do? Something I probably should have done a long time ago. Ben just called. We got the funding. The investor watched your show and was moved by your sincerity. We did it. We did it. Come on. Mm, mm, mm, yeah. We do have to talk about resigning though. OK. We can talk about that later. Well, congratulations. It looks like your work here is done. Wait, I have one more thing I have to do. You are stalling more than an overheated hooptie. Seriously, it's important. I need you to show me how to do that angel magic. There's nothing left to do. I still have one more day to give them my Christmas gift. One more day. Wait. The magic. I'm focusing, but my snaps aren't working An angel's magic isn't in our fingers, it's in our hearts. Now that yours is complete, try again. Hark the harold angels sing. Glory to the newborn king. Peace on Earth and mercy mild. God and sinners reconciled. The first Noel. The angels did sing. Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay. Our family photo. Look at you. Look at that face. Look at that face. Oh my goodness. I mean, this is decorated like our old home. This is so strange. Speaking of strange, did your phone start to play mama's song? It sure did. OK. You don't think that... What? You know that's crazy. Surprise. Merry Christmas. I hope you like it. Tracy let me in. RJ. This is beautiful. Your box, as promised. OK. Don't tell me this is also a part of Robert's plan. No, but he told me that you always exchange gifts, and he didn't leave me anything to give you. So I thought this would be perfect. Ooh, what? My old camera. Mama kept it. Girl, look at this. This is mama's old apron. Now, you know when she put this on, she was getting in that kitchen to burn. I'm going to wear this today. It's midnight. Oh, OK. Well, I guess it's officially Christmas. So Danny and I, we're going to have dinner and Wilson will be there. You should come. Yeah, you should bring your family. I wish I could, but I can't. Well, will you at least come back for a visit? Ladies, I have to go, but I hope you have a very, very Merry Christmas. And remember the best gift at Christmas are things... That money can't buy. Yeah. RJ? Yeah. We just wanted to thank you for... For everything. Thank you. I have to go. I have to go. OK. He dropped his pendant. RJ! Which way did he go? Either he drives very fast or... No. Oh look, it's starting to snow. Wow. Well, as mama would say, another angel's getting their wings. Hark! The Herald angels sing. Glory to the newborn king. Merry Christmas cricket. Merry Christmas. God and sinners reconciled. Joyful all ye nations rise. Join the triumph of the skies. Hark! The herald the herald angels sing. Glory to the newborn king...
