Has she ever tried to commit suicide before! - Yeah. - When was that! - A long time ago she was only 15. - Ron what are you telling him! Somebody tried to poison me. Ron. - I'm sorry baby it's okay. - No somebody tried to poison me. They tried to kill me I didn't try to commit suicide. - Kelly come on now take it easy. Just relax easy. - I'm... - Oh god doc. - It's the strychnine. A lot of internal or external stress can cause hallucinations or compulsions. - [Ron] How long is she gonna be like this! A day a week a month what! - Each case is different. Anyway I started to say in OD cases the law requires observation in a psychiatric ward for 72 hours or more if necessary. - Oh oh oh.

(eerie music) (gasps) - [Male Patient] She's not in the house of the dead. - [Female Patient] She's not dead. - Where am I! - Fifth floor psycho city. Paranoid schizies manic depressives sociopaths psychopaths catatonics. No refunds or returns on rain damage merchandise watch your step please. Once the door closes here it never opens. (laughing) - Ladies you know better than this. I will not have you bothering this patient. You all know you're not supposed to be in here all right. Everybody out now come on. Scoot. (laughing) - He's the one that needs a psychiatrist. - That's funny. He's funny. - Aside from that disturbance how have you slept! - Who are those women what am I doing here! - Now calm down everything's all right. First things first how do you feel! - My whole body my body aches. - Let's have a look here under the tongue. That wasn't so bad now was it! Would you mind sitting up please!

Now won't you take the stethoscope jacket back where you pinched them from and go to your room! And Benny they haven't wore these in the last 10 years. Hi. - Who are you! - I'm Carl your friendly psychiatric technician. - I'd like to use the telephone. - Afraid I couldn't let you do that right now. But I am afraid that you're gonna have to get dressed cause I have to take you to see your psychiatrist. - I'm in the wrong place I don't need a psychiatrist. - I know. I agree with you but you'd better tell that to him. Come on. - Doctor before we start somebody goofed and I'd like to get it straightened out. I don't belong here. - Let's talk about it. I'm Doctor Coleman. Sit down make yourself comfortable. Now Kelly please go on with what you were saying. - I'm not a mental case I didn't try to kill myself. - You think someone poisoned you! - Yes I do. - Well Kelly the police lab checked out those drinks you had at the club. They weren't able to find the slightest trace of a toxic substance. - Well of course not. Whoever did it much have switched the drinks or something. They wouldn't leave it around for the police to find. - Do you think people are out to harm you! - Are you trying to say I'm paranoid now is that what! - That's a good direct question I like it. And I'd like to learn more about you. - I'm doing just great doctor. Fantastic in school I love my job. - What about your boyfriend! - We had a fight. Sometimes relationships just don't work out. - Tell me about yours. - (laughs) You don't give up do you! Look I am doing just fine. - Not according to the police report Kelly. A friend of yours someone who works with you said that you'd considered killing yourself. (groans) - I was just letting off steam. - So those weren't your real feelings. - No not to kill myself. We all say crazy things when we're upset don't we! Look doctor if I tried to do it I'd admit it. When you're done writing that I'd really like to get out of here. - Kelly I'm gonna be straight with you. It's my duty to assess your mental state. You've been in the intensive care unit for the past several days under heavy sedation. I couldn't assess you properly there. You can choose to be a voluntary patient here. - And if I don't! - I'll have to write a 5150 which means I can hold you against your will up to 72 hours. During that time I'll assess you. Once the 72 hours are up it's a different ballgame. - You can't keep me prisoner here. - I'm afraid I have to until I can be reasonably sure that you won't try to kill yourself. - Get your hands off me. - I don't want you to hurt- - Let me go. - Melanie. - Let me go. - Melanie I don't want you to hurt yourself Melanie. - I'm not doing any more time in this stinking scourge bitch. Let me go. (yelling) - Melanie. - All right put it on her. - We don't want you to hurt yourself Melanie. - Calm down Melanie. - We don't want you to hurt yourself. - I'll do anything you want. Anything you want please let me go. Please. - It's all right Melanie. - A new patient has joined our group Kelly. Kelly would you like to introduce yourself! - Okay but I'm getting out the day after tomorrow. - So why don't you leave now! - Yeah take a hike. Psychos only. Gibberish spoken here. - Perhaps you feel you're among inferior company. - Never mind him. Every other word around here is a fight. Crazy houses kinda make people crazy. - Kelly why don't you tell us who you are and what you do! - I'm Kelly McIntyre and I go to college and I work in a disco club. (singing) - Down Magda. - So sorry. - Who would like to begin! - Nurse Hanneford lock me up. - What was that Cathy! - Lock me up. I killed Terry and I'm carrying his baby. - Look who's a murderess. Sweetheart you couldn't hurt a fly. - A car accident is a car accident is a car accident. - What happened Cathy! - Well a bunch of us got loaded at the beach one night I mean really stoned and I tried to put down a couple of times but Terry wouldn't let me. - Why not! - He only said he wanted me to be as high as he was. Anyway Terry got really stoned and passed out in the backseat of the car. I got into the car and I got behind the wheel and the next thing I knew I was going through the guardrail and I woke up in the ambulance and Terry never woke up. (sobs) (claps) - So it's Kelly is it! Big K! I was certain I recognized you from somewhere disco baby or should I say disco whore! - Oh come on. - Nurse can't you do something about him! - Whoo whoo! - Make him stop that. - That man is here only because his father is a physician now get rid of him. He killed a man he should be locked up in the Scoville Hospital- (screams) - Oh my god here we go. All right Derrick. - First time you come out of orbit you fall for a common ignorant everyday slut. - Cursed bastard. - Hold it hold it hold it temper temper temper. - This retarded prick started it. - Just take a walk and cool off huh! Good boy. (eerie music) (gasps) (screams) - [Kelly] No! - What's the matter what are you doing here! - [Kelly] Somebody grabbed me. - It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. Nobody's gonna get you it's okay. It's all right you're safe now. Okay huh! Come on come on. That a girl. It's all right. I think it's the strychnine working on you because it heightens your senses. - No he touched me. - You know something! When I was in Vietnam... - What'd you get! - Six six. - Come on let's see a little fight. - Why! - Hey you've got a baby coming. - They won't let me keep it. - What! - Yeah the judge says I'm an unfit mother. - You need a good lawyer. - How am I gonna get a lawyer with no money and how am I gonna get a job in here! Besides the baby is almost here. - When I get out of here I'll get you a lawyer I promise. - Time for your medication girls. Would you mind moving the board over please! - By all means Nurse Hanneford. - I'd like to use the telephone if I may. - Sorry Doctor Coleman has restricted your calls. It's for your own good. Cathy. Kelly. It's just a mild tranquilizer. (Cathy laughs) Kelly could I talk to you for just a moment please! Kelly I know that you're just trying to help but Cathy has to give up her baby it's a court order. - Well court orders can be changed. I mean she's not on drugs anymore. I think she'd be a good mother. - That is not for you to decide. I don't want you interfering understood! - Let's get out of here. - I can't stand that woman. - She doesn't want me to keep my baby. - Who does she think she is! - Kelly can you really help me! I mean you weren't just saying a bunch of things to make me feel good were you! - No way. Listen we'll figure something out don't worry. - God if only I could keep it if only I could. I should be getting ready. - Hi brought you a roommate. Melanie Crawford I want you to meet Kelly McIntyre and Cathy Burke. - Hello. - [Nurse] Will you help them get situated! - We were talking about Cathy's baby Melanie. - Well when it comes out you should strangle it with its vocal cord or smother it. Kill it before it gets old enough to turn on you and spit and kick you where nobody oughta be kicked. (hisses) - Kelly I'd better go. Bye bye. - Hi Kelly. - Hello. - Came to take you for your shower. - Thanks Carl but I'm a big girl now. I can bathe all by myself. - Oh I know that I know that but orders. The hospital's liable if you have a seizure. A staff member strong enough to control you must be present at all times. Look you can go ahead and get into your robe and I'll wait out here okay! (Melanie laughs) You're one of the prettiest girls that I've ever seen here on the fifth floor I mean that. Hey you need anything like pads cosmetics extra food little something for your sweet tooth all you gotta do is ask me. - Well I'm leaving tomorrow thank you. - Means nothing at all. I've come for a week and stayed for a lifetime. Doctors and nurses they come and go but I don't know I guess I just like my work. Oh hey this way. Right this way Kelly. You know nothing makes me feel more better during the day than a nice hot shower. Hey we do this all the time. But you better hurry up cause we can't stand around here all day. Oh watch out for the hot water don't let it scald you. Want someone to soap your back! No one has to charge. Want your back washed! - No. - See we soap 'em shave 'em shower 'em. All part of the job don't mean nothing much. - I don't want you to do that. - Kelly when they shut the door behind you on the fifth floor you're in a whole new world I mean a whole new world anything goes up here anything at all. You gotta cut loose and let yourself go. Take it easy. Nobody blames a psycho I mean you got needs too. - Leave me alone I'm gonna yell. - They can't hear you and even if they could psychos yell all the time. Don't mean a thing. Besides I never knew anybody didn't like their back washed. (screams) - Hey I was just joking. Can't you take a joke! - Help me somebody help me. - Kelly what's the matter! What is it Kelly! (sobbing) - It's all right. - Just relax just calm down. - What happened! - Poor kid she had a full blown paranoid episode. - Liar liar. How dare you degrade me treat me like an animal. You almost raped me. - No come on. - Get him away from me. Get him away from me. Get away from me get him away from me. Get him away no. I don't belong here get me out of here please. - Calm down. - I can't control this. - It's all right. - Get away from me. Get me out of here. - She de-compensated rather suddenly. I never noticed any symptoms. - [Kelly] I want out of here. - Maybe that's because you're behind that glass cage a little too much. I mean she was already agitated when I took her to the shower. - Was she! - Mm-hmm. - This will have to come up in staff. - By all means I want it to. Just clear the air. Oh Jackie how are you and Nurse Whelan doing! You two still getting along well together these days all right! - What... What are you trying to say Carl! - Nothing. Nothing. Jackie we got our jobs to protect you know! I mean it's us against them. - I'll see you in staff. - Bright and early. - I'd like a clear picture of last night's occurrence. - I accompanied the patient to the shower room she became somewhat anxious expressed displeasure at my presence. I tried to calm her. Once in the shower I stayed two to three yards from her at all times. She began projecting and acting out a sexual fantasy yelling at me to stop fondling her private parts in very graphic language. - Why didn't you call in a female staff member! - I was afraid she was gonna go into convulsions again. - How did you let her run out of control all over the fifth floor! - I had no choice she became violent. I would've had to use very very excessive force. - How is Kelly this morning! - Still maintaining her paranoid delusions. - I'm not certain at this time whether we're confronting a strychnine reaction or an underlying psychosis. Obviously we can't discharge her today. All right we'll hold her another two weeks till we can sort it all out. Well that's it back to Hocsland. Oh Carl. - Yes sir. - You know Kelly is a very attractive young woman. Are you doing any acting out! - Acting out! No sir. I don't get involved with the patients I've been around too long for that. - I'm glad to hear that Carl because if I find out different you won't just be fired you'll face felony charges. - Yes sir. Hi. Shh. Look Kelly I'm sorry about what happened yesterday. I was out of line and I admit it. It'll never happen again. Anyway if you need anything or well you want me for anything all you gotta do is call. Oh when she wakes up make sure she takes her pill okay! You try and get some sleep. - Don't start with Carl. - Carl started with me. I'm in here for two more weeks. - Kelly. Everything you do or say is charted. It goes down in your record. Forget it ever happened. You may never get out of here. The first time I was here Carl came after me. - He did! - When I said I wouldn't he made it unbearable for me. He finally got everything he wanted. Kelly! Whatever it takes get out of this place. - The little lithium pills they give you they're really nice. It's happiness in a bottle. I was beginning to think that was the only kind- - Oh you're back. - [Woman] I'm proud to announce it Melanie- - I missed you. Look what I brought for you flowers. Those are your favorites right! - Yes. - Kelly you know I can't help but think that this whole thing you wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for our fight. - Hey. You don't think I tried to commit suicide. - I don't know what to think. - Well I didn't. Listen somebody tried to kill me. Have you gone to the police what have they said! - I talk to them every day and- - And! - They wanna know who would wanna poison you and why. - Well I don't know who it would be. Somebody- - Kelly don't get excited all right! - Hello hello hello. Well now look at that won't you just look at that. Pretty flowers like that deserve to be in some water. Damn those smell good. - That guy. That guy almost raped me. - I know I know. - Did you hear me! He almost raped me in the shower. Did you hear me! - Yes I know baby. - You gotta get me out of here Ron. - Good afternoon Mr. Denton. Kelly dear I think it's time your guest left. - We're right in the middle of a conversation. - Kelly it's okay and it's for your own good. It's okay I'm leaving. - Good I'll see you out. - Melanie we just dropped in to see how you were getting in and have to run now. - Oh I wish you wouldn't. Tell me about the children. - [Man] They're great just great. Doreen here is a good little pitch hitter. - [Melanie] Doreen's a good little bitch. - [Man] Come off it Melanie. - [Melanie] I'm sorry. - I couldn't do without Doree but I can do without you and your sickness all the time. - I know I know I'm sorry I'm sorry. Listen please don't go. Come back and see me soon. I love you. Goodbye Doreen. (ominous music) - What are you doing! Melanie. Stop. (moaning) Why didn't you let me die! I can't stand it anymore. I just can't take any more. He brought her to my house in my bed in front of us and the kids and he told me to get out of his life. Hard to accept it. I tried to accept it. Without him I don't exist I'm nothing. - No you're not Melanie. - I'm less than nothing. - No you're not. - Okay Melanie let's go. - Where are you taking her! - A little therapy. Come with me. Come on that's a good girl that's a good girl. (rhythmic music) Okay up we go. That a girl. Watch your head. - What'd you do to her! - Oh she'll be okay. Just needs a little sleep. Candy! In case you change your mind. - I'm not going to change my mind Carl. - Just in case you do. - One two three clap one two three clap one two three. Follow me that's right. Now you do it straight. - I'm programmed for earthly gyrations have other contributions to make. (funky music) - Okay the party is over. Everybody back to their rooms. - You never let us have any fun. - Why are you doing this! You can let them have a little fun can't you! - Orders I'm just following orders. - You won't quit until you get what you want will you! Why don't you and I just go and get it over with! Around midnight! - Where! - The eastern tea room! Nobody'll find us there. - All right. I'll go unlock it. You'd better show up. - I will. - I know you will. All right loonies you have one more hour. (cheering) Oh boy. Slow tonight huh! Think I'll go get some rest. - Go ahead I'll cover for you. - I was hoping you'd say that darling. - [Kelly] Don't turn the light on Carl. Then the nurses can see us. Come on over here. - Where are you! - [Kelly] On the table. - Jesus Christ you're kinkier than I am. I love it. - [Kelly] Come on hurry up what are you doing! - I'm gonna take my pants off. You're gonna love it baby. (laughing) Give it to me baby. Give it to me. (screaming) - Happy birthday! - Keep quiet Bart we're never gonna fight with you or Pittsburgh. - Happy birthday! What a birthday trophy. - Hello baby come on. Over here baby. Come on baby. Come on we'll give you something come on baby. - Well very funny Kelly very funny. That was a good joke I like that. Yeah I sure did.

All right everybody let's go eat. - [Woman] I wanna watch the bears. - Hurry up we're all hungry come on. - All right just keep talking. - Okay. - You'll be hearing from me. - Don't forget to get in touch with somebody at the outside for me okay! - Melanie give me your hand. - Carl.

Ron Ron! (phone rings) - Kelly! - Ron. - What's the matter! Hey when did you get out! Why didn't you call me let me know! - I couldn't. - Where are you going! - To Jenny's. - Jenny! - I escaped. I gotta get out of here before... I gotta get out of here before Carl and his white coats show up. - Honey let's talk about it. - My god you sound like a shrink. I'm not crazy. - Of course you're not. The hospital said- - To hell with the hospital I'm not gonna go back there. - Listen Kelly don't jump me I'm trying to help. Just hear me out okay! Maybe just maybe this poison is mixing things up in your mind. - No everything I told you is true. I'm not imagining it. - Listen Kelly. What do you say you and me... Baby come on. We both go down and talk to your doctor. - Are you kidding he'll never let me out of there. What am I standing here talking to you for! - Because I love you. - I know you do. But they're wrong. I'm not suicidal. I'm not paranoid I know I'm not. You gotta trust me Ron. - I gotta tell you Kelly I still think you need professional help. - You're in it with them aren't you! Oh my god. - Kelly. - Let me go. Let me out of here. - Kelly listen. - God damn it you're in it with them. - Listen to me. - Let me go. - Relax will you! - Let me out of here. - Let's go.

You're a fighter and you've got lots going for you. (laughs) I've got nothing. Kelly. - I happen to have mentioned that Ronnie was in to see me. He's concerned about you. Kelly we aren't getting anywhere. I feel I oughta tell you what I told Ronnie. Your escape set you back. I'm afraid we're gonna have to keep you here the full 90 days. - Oh no you won't. - All right prove me wrong. I'm more than willing to release you tomorrow but I'm not the enemy. The staff isn't the enemy. Your illness is. Kelly what are you afraid of! Why won't you at least take a look at yourself! - I do look at myself but you don't. You wouldn't know the truth if it jumped up and bit you on the ass. - I did make it through medical school. - You look at what I do not what I am. - I don't blame you for being angry. Happens to patients all the time. But you must be aware that your mind is tuned to an incredibly high pitch right now from the strychnine. The lust the cruel streak that you sense in people like Carl right on. But it's occurring out there on an unconscious level. Don't you see Carl isn't acting these things out. It's your imagination that's filling in the blanks. - Bullshit doctor. - What have we here! A tasty morsel so delicate. So frail. So anemic. I hate thy blood. Ah something more to my liking. Looks to me like hefty plasma. Bluh bluh bluh bluh. - No no. - Gee maybe I should've done my Brando for him huh Kel! What do you think! Marco we'll make him an offer he can't refuse. - Will you shut up! - Hi Carl. - Where are they taking her! - Bzzt. - Kelly did you talk to any people outside! - No Cath I didn't get a chance. - I was counting on you. - I know I'm gonna get to a phone somehow. - Kelly they're watching you. - I brought you breakfast. Think it's edible! - Kelly why are you always so good to me! - Melanie you've got your whole life ahead of you. Don't let them get you down. - Kelly I love you. You're my friend. You're my only friend. - Good morning girls. Well how are you this morning! (chuckles) - What's your name! - Melanie. (laughs) - Don't you have a last name! - Wouldn't it be better if you left her alone for now! - Just relax Kelly. Where do you live Melanie! - Oh you know. (laughs) - Yes we know it's in the records but I want you to tell me. - 10... Euclid. The numbers the numbers... The numbers won't come. - That's not unusual after shock therapy. It'll clear up later. Can you tell me your children's names! - Why are you asking me these questions! - It's part of your treatment. Do you know why you're here Melanie! - The great explosion in San Francisco. (laughs) - All right I'll see you later. - Melanie don't cry. It's all right it's all right. Melanie look at me look at me. You're all right you're all right. You okay! - Yeah. - Come on let's go for a walk. You want to! - Yeah. - Come on let's get out of here.
