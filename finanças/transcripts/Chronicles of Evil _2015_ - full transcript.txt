CJ ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTS A B.A. ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTION EXECUTIVE PRODUCER JEONG TAE-SUNG That's the murderer. He killed twelve people. SON HYUN-JOO He killed twelve people. SON HYUN-JOO DON LEE CHOI DANIEL Let's go! I am... the son of a murderer. THE CHRONICLES OF EVIL President's Award for Exemplary Officers The award must be a big deal. Your photo's already online. I'm back. If your stars line up, you'll be at HQ in no time. - Thank you. - Bullshit. Sly fox, you made me lobby for you. All right. You deserve it after 15 years of homicide cases. Evaluation's this month. Until that's over, don't get caught up in anything, and lay low. Yes, I understand. WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY BAEK WOON-HAK Here comes the chief! Congratulations! Choi Chang-sik! Choi Chang-sik! Choi Chang-sik! Choi Chang-sik! Congratulations! It's a good day, but there's work, sir. The case involving Mr. Kim of Jangan-dong needs to be processed. Yeah? As we discussed, I left out the assault charge. Good work. He helped out Detective Park last year, so it's quid pro quo. Right. - Proceed. - At once. A light sentence will do him good. - Sure. - Hey. What's this? From our generous patron, share them with the boys. There are so many gift certificates here. It's your gift, you should use them. It was your case. I'll take care of the brass, so don't worry. All right. We'll put these to good use. Chief Choi Chang-sik Send Dong-jae in. Did you ask for me? I got your case file. You did this yourself? Yes, Detective Park said it was a simple case. But what a pity, you flunked. It looks like you're siding with the suspect. The thing is... The time of the victim's death is weird. And there's no motivation. It's not enough cause for first degree homicide. What's the keyword for this case? Well... it's... 'Incidental instinct.' He was robbing a corner store, but got caught and killed a part-time employee. Humans resort to instincts in an extreme situation. It's in these places where we witness our capacity for evil for impending circumstances. If you get emotionally invested, you can't survive here. Remove your emotions, and only consider the facts, okay? Yes, sir. And why does my family like you more than me? I was supposed to bike with Myung-ho... Please tell him we'll go for sure next week. I got it. And this Saturday, come eat your birthday meal at my place. Isn't it your birthday? I know you don't have time to visit your folks. Get back to work. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. To the best police chief in the country! - To our chief! - To our chief! - Congratulations! - All the way! Congrats! Congrats! There's a rumor that you're heading for the HQ, so you'll be suiting up everyday. We put our heads together and decided on this small gift. Put it on for him. How is it? Don't I look like a boss? - Major shit! - The best! Across the Pacific, across the Atlantic, even across the Indian Ocean I will run to see you I'll come no matter what Boss! You're the man today. The best! You little cutie! Chief, don't favor him so much. We're getting jealous! Slap my ass too. - Good night! - Night, sir! Take care, boss! Salute! Mok-dong district 7. Hey, son. It's dad. Of course, I'm the best cop in Korea. Okay. Put mom on. It just ended. I'm doing this to make you the queen. A man must have unquenchable ambition. Okay, okay. I'll see you soon. Where are we? I said Mok-dong. Mister, go to Mok-dong 7. Stop the car, I'm a cop! Stop the car! What a pain in the ass for a damn cop. Stop the car! I said I'm a cop! Calm down and drop the knife. Drop it! Who are you? What's going on? So damn talkative. Should I tell you why you must die? You arrested Mr. Kim in China. You took bribes and set him free. Want another? Yujin Construction's Park, Jo Nam-oh, bar owner Lee Myung-chun... You even kept Lee's money all to yourself. You're a scumbag. Did Lee send you? To threaten me? I don't care how much money you got or from whom. But why dig up old cases and cause headaches? You have to die for me to live. You deserve everything, asshole! Die! You fucking cockroach! Pull your shit together. Wake up! Wake up! Superintendent Ju Yes, sir. Hey, Chang-sik! Do you know who I'm with? Remember Deputy Commander Park? Head of HR. Yes, I do. I'm pushing him to give you that promotion. Happy? Yes. I gave him a good push, so stay out of trouble. The world will change so much for you. Different work, and different people too. A whole new playing field. Then we'll go all the way. Okay? Yes, sir. Look! What is it? - Oh my god! - What is that? Gangnam Police Station Mom, if it's Uncle Dong-jae, let me say hello! You're not like yourself today. Bed-ridden all of sudden. It's Dong-jae, he sounded urgent. Yeah, Dong-jae. Some sick fuck hung a body from the crane. It was out in the open, so we couldn't stop the press. - The body? - This way. - What's with the neck? - It's a scratch. Something wrong? Someone you know? Anything odd at the scene? The case is already odd, so everything's going to shit. What a fucking nut job. We need his fingerprints. Sure, please hurry. Mt. Woomyun - All right, thank you. - Thank you. Hey, Dong-jae! I'm on it! A cab at a construction site? Check every inch, and pop the trunk. Sure. A corpse was found hanging at a construction site. The chase for the culprit has captured our nation's full attention. Someone kills a man, and hangs him right at our doorstep. So imagine my reputation. It's an order from the top. Our reputations are on the line! Get everyone on it, and catch him at all costs! Chief Choi, do you understand? Yes, I understand. A task force has already been formed, and our top officer Chief Choi Chang-sik is heading up the investigation. In the name of our honor, we'll arrest the killer. Top Cop to Head the Crane Murder Case The victim was a contract driver who borrowed others' cabs. His name is Jung Ji-su, 42 and single. He had assault and drug charges. He clocked in on the morning of the 21st and was killed that night, and he was transported in his trunk. Any prints or DNA samples from the cab? The prints were completely wiped off, so there isn't any concrete evidence. Judging from Jung's records, we could narrow down the search fields. We'll start with his associates, and get a list of suspects, then sort through nearby CCTVs and track the cab's route that evening. It's a solid target, so it'll give us some leads. Good. Get to it. Unit A, focus on the site's entrance and vicinity. Okay. Unit B, expand the search to the entirety of Gangnam. Okay. The plate is 31J5387, keep your eyes peeled and find me its route. - Got it? - Yes, sir! Here's the CD. It's the night of the 21st. Sir, it's forensics, they got a sample from the body. Irrefutable evidence. Skin cells obtained from under the victim's nails! He and the killer had a physical confrontation. The skin cells from a scratch remained under the nails. So a nail scratch? Probably left a wound. Send me DNA samples of your suspects. This is indisputable evidence. I know the commissioner is all over this, I believe we did all we can. Go frame by frame. - I found him! - You got it? Where? Show me. - Zoom in. - Yes. You're right, it's 5387. At 2:05 AM, he entered Daechi district, so narrow down the direction and keep tracking. - I got him. - Yeah? Let's see. It's 5387. That's it. Where is it? It was heading this way. I got him, come check it out. Isn't it 5387? He's over here too! - Where? - Here. Okay, where is that? It connects here. Where are we? Detective Oh! Take a look! What's this? What is it? You're under arrest for murder. You have the right to remain silent. Sir, you need to see this. We've tracked the cab backwards from the site. We found out that it came from Mt. Woomyun. As you see, the driver is alone in the car. This is Banpo district at 12:28 AM. Here, the cab was heading for Mt. Woomyun. Now it gets interesting, take a look. Play it. Stop. If you look closely, there's a rider in the back. It's a pity that the face can't be enhanced, but two went up the mountain, and only one came down. I think we got the answer. The passenger must be the killer. When we track the cab route backwards, heading towards Mt. Woomyun, I'm certain we can catch the killer getting in the cab. Any chance of uncovered areas or mistaken identity? Well, it depends by area, but I'm sure we can pull it off. - Good night! - Yup. Night, sir! - Take care, boss! - Salute! CCTV ID: Sinsa 1-78 Dong-jae! Yes, Detective Oh. Why are you alone? You looked out of it earlier too. Something on your mind? Not at all. Something's definitely bothering you. Tell me, what is it? Too big a case? Not at all. Bullshit. There's something fishy about this case. How so? Who knows, comes with a decade of experience. Heightened intuition. Been working out? I started working out since last week, feel it. - You feel it already? - Of course! - Evening, sir. - Salute. - Have you had dinner? - Evening, sir. Sinsa 1-78 Sinsa 1-76 Anything? Nothing so far. - Going well. - Yes, sir. Yeah. There's nothing. I found it! It's a residential CCTV towards the site. It's the killer for sure! What? Really? Let's take a look. Let's see. Move aside. Play. - It's the cab? - Yes. It's 5387. Is that a body in the trunk? Pause for a moment here. - Zoom in. - Yes, sir. - Is it a body? - It's the deceased. It is a body. Get the address, and go! Yes, sir. It's him! Hey! You there! Bastard! Lost him? - Where did he go? - We may have lost him. Disperse. - Find him. - Yes, sir. I'm at a cul-de-sac, he's not here. Then canvas east from there. Go that way, I'll go this way. I didn't kill him! I was told to go there, and he was already dead! I just followed his instructions. I only moved the body to the site and hung him up! Who is he? He might kill me... I'm so fucked because of that bastard! Who the hell is he?! Drop the gun and get the fuck away! Why is everyone up my ass? I didn't kill him! Anyone have eyes on him? Where the chief? He's not up here. Unit A reporting, not here either. Chief, do you copy? Name, Lee Jung-hoon, unemployed, no next of kin. According to his phone records, he had no contact with the victim, but there was a common number to a throwaway phone created 3 years ago under the ID of an agent at Mirae Entertainment, which is a dead end. What happened? Even if he was a threat, how could you shoot to kill? Whether he was the killer or not, a man died in the line of duty. Any use of deadly force must be justified. Any witnesses? I'll take full responsib... I was just behind him and saw the whole thing. It was dark, and he wielded a knife, so shooting him was the only option. I'll be the witness. Yes, I saw too, it was unavoidable. - Me too. - I saw it too. Look at this. Covering for their boss. Make sure there's no backlash, and settle it quietly. In all honesty, I don't care if Lee's dead or alive. What's important is, he has to be the killer. Are you... absolutely certain? As you saw earlier, proven by drug arrests and a history of mental illness, both men were also under the influence. Traces of metopon were in his blood... 'Metopon'? It's a drug that's extracted from morphine, according to forensics, because the toxicity is too high even the drug has low demand now. So it's even more difficult to obtain. So they killed over the drug? What's more important than a hit to addicts? It's a solid motive. CCTV recordings are enough to prove his actions afterwards. Lastly, if Lee's DNA samples match the recovered skin cells, then this case is as good as closed. The forensics report will be out tomorrow. It was all but certain that Lee was the killer, and he was shot during his arrest, because he couldn't be contained. The investigators are analyzing his DNA samples to prove that he was the killer, and we'll report the result as soon as it's available. That is all. Can you confirm that he was the killer? When will you get the result? Just give us a day. - Let's wrap it up. - Sure. Sang-won, go get the car. Come quick. Chief. We're going out for a drink, would you like to come? I'm fine. Don't take it to heart. Yeah. Dong-jae. - Come here. - Yes, sir. Things on your mind again? Look how tight your muscles are. You need to drink more. Detective Oh. Yeah? Don't you think the chief is acting a bit strange? - Kiddo. - Sir? When you look hard enough, anything in life is odd. Don't overthink it. You complicated bastard. That's not it. After a long struggle, he's finally going places, and under the intense pressure of this case he even accidentally killed a suspect. Imagine the stress. Anyone in his situation would be on the edge. We have to support him. You have to die for me to live. I just followed his instructions. Traces of metopon were in his blood... Shitty luck alert. Business doing well? Don't fucking greet him. I asked you a question. What's going on?! Don't hit me. I don't fucking deal drugs! I don't fucking deal! I deal! I deal! I fucking deal! I deal... I deal... Metopon, who deals it nowadays? Metopon? No one wants that shit, there's better stuff out there. I'm serious! Really! It was trendy for a bit last year, but no one's doing it anymore 'cause it's so addictive. Once you try that, nothing else will get you high. Did anyone look for it recently? I said no one's looking for it. Then tell me everything you know about it! Metopon, AKA methyl... something... AKA 'the killer' on the street. It's refined in Busan, sold at $200 a piece. Clients are the usual suspects. Remember the movie star drug scandal last year? - Movie star? - Yes. A bunch of B-listers who faded into obscurity. Jo Sun-young, Kim Jin-kyu... They were arrested for doing metopon. Phone bought with Mirae agent ID Kim Jin-kyu, actor Morning, sir. Chief, one sec. Forensics report came out, Lee's not a match. I heard. So he's not the killer. Dammit. Get your ass in there! What the hell happened? You said he was the one. We'll reinvestigate. Reinvestigate what? The entire country is watching this! You killed the wrong suspect, and misled the media! Who's gonna clean up this mess! Choi Chang-sik. Sir? This DNA report does not exist. I'll handle the forensics head, so get your men on board, and fix this DNA report. Case closed, as of now. Since both Lee and Jung are dead, circumstantial evidence and CCTV footage should be enough to convince the public. No? Case closed? Kim Jin-kyu was... in complete hiding after the scandal, but he called me out of nowhere. He wanted to quit. That is all. I don't know his current whereabouts. Did he have any close associates? Well, he was such an introvert... There was a rumor that he was gay. Is he in any trouble? I need to check something with him. Could you help? Yes, of course. I'll look into it and give you a call. Did he... sign a contract by any chance? His address would be on it. I'm Detective Cha from Gangnam Police Station. There was a missing CCTV feed, could I get a copy of it? Sure, please write down location and date. Sinsa 1-78 From last Wednesday, the 21st. From last Wednesday, the 21st. One moment. Sinsa 1-78 Chief! Yes, Dong-jae. Chief? Yeah. There's a superior I respect immensely. At a crime scene I found his personal item. I first thought it was a coincidence. But shortly afterwards, I caught him stealing a vital piece of evidence to a murder case. Then he shot and killed a fleeing suspect, who held the key to solving this case. I thought it was very peculiar. So I got a copy of the evidence he stole. It contained sufficient evidence to pin him as the prime suspect of this case. What must I do in this situation? It's too hard, Chief. He must have a reason, so I made a decision. 'Let's just tell him everything I know.' 'And see how he fixes this problem.' I believe that he will make a wise solution. Sinsa 1-78 Have a good night, Chief. Yes? Hello, Chief. It's Ahn from Mirae Entertainment. I got in touch with Kim Jin-kyu. No, I didn't find him. He actually called me, I don't know how he found out. Asked why I wanted him. I told him about you, and he knows you well. He said he'll meet you soon. I don't know if this will help, but I came across it while I was asking around. He runs a bar called Mojo in Sangam district. Mt. Woomyun Park Yes, Chief. Go ahead. Could you look up the following areas for cases? May 11th, Anyang. 6th, Jinchun. 2nd, Gwangmyung. Okay, one moment. Sir, there are open murder cases linked to all 3 areas. All of the victims are former cops. Jo Woon-Gil for Anyang, Ju Jin-suk for Jinchun, Park Gwang-choon for Gwangmyung. I knew Park from before, I even went to his funeral. What's this about? Park Gwang... Jin-suk! Jin-suk! Gwang-choon, Woon-Gil, we got a huge case! It's an emergency! Let's move! My god... The massacre took place at an illegal casino, all 12 victims were killed with cyanide. It's a special order! Solve this case by any means necessary. It's him! Wait, who are you? Come out, asshole! Let go! Let go of me! - Lee Jung-hoon! - Grab him! Untie me! Did you know them? I don't know any of them! I've never met that woman! Never! Goddammit! Unsolved Casino Massacre Police Incompetency? Special Order by Metro Police Is this your best?! What's the problem?! Bring me a suspect, even if you have to make one! Do you understand?! Yes. Chief, it's ready. Suspect Kim Bong-su... has physical as well as mental disabilities, and barely made minimum wage by working at the casino, but was constantly assaulted by the victims. He confessed that his grudge led him to mix cyanide into their drinks. Thereby killing all 12 people at once. In addition to his confession, 2 witnesses came forward, who were present at the scene. Kim Jin-kyu Can I help you? I would like to confess. Confess to what? I recently killed someone and hung him on a crane. What? I'm the one, who hung a body from the crane. Chief, please come! A man named Kim Jin-kyu came to confess. He hasn't said much yet. Kim Jin-kyu, 28, was a movie actor. He too has a few drug arrests. He says he'll only talk to Chief Choi. Before we begin, could you turn it off? You know, the outgoing mic. Do it. Now, let's begin. Interrogate me. Did you really kill Jung Ji-su? Of course not. How could I? I saw you killing him with my eyes. What's he saying? I never wanted to cause such ruckus. I was going meet you privately outside. But I noticed that you were going to cover up this case. So I came in person like this. Kim Jin-kyu. Yes? Is this because of your dad? Anyang, Jinchun, Gwangmyung, you did it. You sent Jung after me, you hung him from the crane, you're behind it all. I'm impressed. Stop it, it's all in the past. Had you died as I intended that night, this wouldn't have happened. You would have all died one by one and that'd be it. But you messed up my plan by killing my man. That son of a... But thanks to you, everything's gotten a lot more interesting. I'm enthralled to see you as a cornered rat. Humans are quite foolish. Jung and Lee... they committed one crime after another, trying to cover up their original crime, and they did anything to get promoted. You're not all that different from them. Since you managed to kill my minions, you'll have to take their place. Not a chance. Really? I got a video of you killing him on my cellphone. Matter of seconds before it's online. If you know why I'm doing this, then you know what you must do. Right. You'll have to kill someone for me. You know who. What? You already killed two, what's one more to you? Deadline is 9:00 PM tonight, you have two hours. The choice is yours, either comply, or pay for your crimes. I will not be dragged in the mud. Make no mistake. If you do not stop here, I will kill you. I must be off now. Clear me of all suspicion. So? Is he the one? His statement lacks credibility. He got creative with what was reported on TV. But we should keep him and look into him further. Lieutenant Kang, give him a go. Yes, sir. He's a weird one. Like Choi said, he's not making any sense. This won't do, let's start from the top. Kang will take over the case. Stay fully focused. You left out the most important aspect! Kim Jin-kyu... What a fucking idiot... Verify his ID and let him loose. We can keep him for 48 hours, why not observe him... What the hell for? Nut jobs like him only muddle our investigation. The media is watching us, what if we're barking up the wrong tree? How'll you manage? Kick him out. Yes, sir. You'll have to kill someone for me. You know who. President's Award Is the superintendent in? He's gone for the day. When? About 30 minutes ago. He has a district meeting at the Olympic Park. Where's Kim Jin-kyu? We had to let him loose, chief. Kang's order. But I put a tail on him, something wrong? Check his current location. Where the hell did this bastard go? Kiddo, you should've ignored the red light. I'm sorry. Yes, sir. It's me, where is he now? Do your damn job properly! Find him ASAP! Sons of bitches... He slipped away near Olympic Park... Find him, and bring him in! Criminal Record Superintendent Ju Chief Choi Chang-sik I'm sorry, the person you have called is unavailable. Chief, it's Jin-kyu. Time's almost up, have you decided? Let's stop this. Made up your mind yet? Just stop it! I knew it'd be like this. If you won't, you leave me no choice. I'll have to do it myself. You're just in time. No, the other way. Do you see? The superintendent. I left something in his car not too long ago. I wonder if it'll be spectacular like in the movies. Superintendent! Get out! Superintendent! Get out! Now there's just you. Aren't you curious? Why did I drag a dead man along this far? There's an important task you must complete. My father's case. Please find the real killer. Kim Jin-kyu. Die... Let's die... together. What's going on? I'll follow him! Chief, what happened? Where's Kim? Dong-jae's following him. Video of The Real Crane Killer, Chief Choi What the...? Isn't that our Chief? Looks like it, that's Chief Choi. What is it, move aside. What is this? Sir! The superintendent is dead! In an explosion. What did you say?! Move. Investigators: Jo Woon-Gil... Anyang: Jo Woon-Gil... Lead investigator: Ju Won-il What the hell's going on? Yes, Chief? Dong-jae. Where is he now? He's heading towards Sangam. Okay. As you know, I accidentally killed a man. It's a long story, but... I will make the wise solution. Before then, I need to meet him. He's dangerous, so be careful. Stay on him until I get there. I understand, Chief. Locate Chief Choi using his cellphone, and send a tact team to his location! On the double! Yes, sir. Fax me the files, but can you give me his name and ID first? Yes. 8808. Name? Are you absolutely sure? Dong-jae, where you at? There's an urgent matter, I need your help. Okay, I'll be right there, wait for me. Yes, sir. Jin-kyu, you are here. Is it over now? You're here, finally. How was my performance? Convincing? What are you saying? I'm just an actor. And an obedient friend. He's... someone I love. Who the hell is he?! Dong-jae! What took you so long? I'm told you taught him. "Incidental instinct.“ Dong-jae. Right... Dong-jae. His name was also Jin-kyu. We still call each other that. Dong-jae, stop this. You are the son of Kim Bong-su. Kim Jin-kyu. 'Dong-jae' is your adopted name. I know all about it. Bravo. Son of a... This... Dong-jae, this is not right, you can't do this. Please. Stop this. Don't move, asshole! Think you can arrest me? Don't move! Get up. Cha Dong-jae! Asshole! Snap out of it! You fuck! It's all over. Put a stop to this, Dong-jae. No. I still have a job to do. You bastard... I'm sorry, Detective. Could you do me a favor? When you meet him, please don't kill him. To me... he's more important than life itself. - Dad. - Yes, son. When are you coming? Dong-jae's here, he said you're coming. Put him on! Now! Yes, Chief. Dong-jae, listen. Leave my family out of this. I'll clear your father's name. I'll find the real killer and kill him in front of you. Will you keep your promise? I'll keep my promise no matter what. Don't touch my family! Please! Dong-jae! Please! Don't worry, I'm at the park with Myung-ho. Come right away. Our usual spot. You have to die for me to live. Die! I just followed his instructions. I'm just an actor. Who the hell is he?! Get out! Myung-ho... Chief! Where's my son?! I was probably his age. My dad and I only had each other. Son! Dad! He did all he could to raise me even enduring their endless contempt. Thank you. Then one day, he didn't come home. So I went to the place where he worked. The despicable men were... There was not a single decent human being. Please have a drink. It was you? Right. I confessed to everyone that I was the one, but you took my dad away. You made up witnesses, and even created evidence too. Then one day, I heard that he received the death penalty. From that day on, I became 'Cha Dong-jae, ' and began formulating my plan. Now... what will you do? Will you keep your promise and kill me? Dad! Get to your positions, and wait for my order! Yes, sir! Chief Choi! It's Lieutenant Kang! Drop your gun and surrender! - Dad! - I'm warning you! - Myung-ho! You can't go there. - Drop your gun and surrender! Dad! Dad! So in the end, just like my father, you'll be called a killer in front of your son. Choi Chang-sik! Drop your gun and surrender, or we will fire! I'm warning you! Drop your gun and surrender, or we will fire! This is the end of my plan, and if you do not keep your promise, how will I go on living? Is it okay for me... to continue living? Now, could you please keep your promise? Where did it all go wrong? Hurry. Arrest him! Sir... I did it, please take me. Jin-kyu, I know. You and your dad... aren't bad people. Come on, Choi! Let's get out of here. Be strong and live well, okay? Jin-kyu, Jin-kyu... 1 year ago Class of what? 2013, sir. Class of 2013... How's Professor Lee? He's still alive and kicking. He actually told me a lot about you. Like what? That you were a righteous cadet. And that you're a good man. Once upon a time. I heard you wanted to join my unit. Yes. Why?
