♪ Mmmmm, Mmmmm, Mmmmm ♪ Bear, bear, bear, bear! Did you see it? Dear dad. I've been riding for six months and there's a lot to say, so I'm writing you this letter. I think the river's high because we had 12 hours of rain If you don't believe me, you can look at him. Yes, that's true. Hi, my name is Chandler and I'm doing a movie on my family's trip to the Brazos, and we're doing the Upper Brazos, which is right here. Is that for me? Oh, hi there! It sure is a beautiful day here on the South Llano River. It's a wonderful day to be out here with the family This story is about you. And what you passed on to me, through our adventures. With those trips, came a deep love for wilder places. They shaped who I am and my understanding of the world. It seemed if I followed you, we could go anywhere. And that's what I did. For 19 years in life and adventure, until you weren't there to follow anymore. Suicide is a hard word to write. I found it almost impossible to say. It's so hard because it doesn't just define the act, but the entire life that came before it. Dad, it placed you into a darkness that's hard to overcome. When I did say it aloud, the word itself seemed to overshadow your life. Even though I still loved you, the way you had died hid you deep inside my memories. I was trying to figure out how to get you back. And there are things I'm trying to understand. What I do know is that you suffered from depression. Along with 10% of other Americans. And like 30,000 other people that year, you fell victim to suicide. I haven't found talking about mental illness easy. The sickness of depression is personal and individual. I'm sorry you felt the need to battle it alone. And I'm sorry every day that we lost you. My quest now is not to lose the memory of you as well. Seven years have past, and New York City is home now. I love the urban jungle with all its excitement and energy, but that doesn't mean I've given up on my adventures and past. I still find my ways to escape. Five years ago, I discovered bicycle touring. You didn't introduce me to it, but it's a combination of everything that you loved. The premise is simple. Pack your bags called panniers, load them onto your bike, and hit the back roads. It's a way to find the quieter moments, the kind you couldn't find in a car. You sleep under the stars and live simply. It can be tough, but, it's the most rewarding way to travel and see the country. I've always been drawn to the road. It represents the promise of adventure if you follow it long enough. It's an extension of what you taught me to love. And when I'm out there, I think of you. But still, I struggled with how suicide had altered that memory of you. I kept thinking back on all those trips, wondering if there was something to find, a way that I could salvage that memory. So the plan was to hit the road with my bicycle and head west as far as I could go, to the end of the road in Alaska. I was taking the questions I had with me and hoped to find my answer. So this is my favorite view of the city. And I just wanted to check it out one last time before I leave. I dunno, coming here, it makes me almost question what I'm doing. I'm going to miss this place. We're at the very top of Manhattan and we're sitting under the George Washington Bridge. This is my dad's favorite beer. And I left home really young and I never got a chance to drink it with him. I wanted to leave something for you at the end of the road. Something so that you in your own way were always there. I had heard of a way to give a name to a geographic feature that had none - streams, hills, valleys, even mountains, which is what I'm going to do for you. I'm going to reach the end of the road, find the nearest mountain and name it after you. I would be able to save that memory, I knew it. The journey was supposed to be a solo ride, but things change. I had decided to film the whole journey and I could only find one of my filmmaking friends who wanted to come along and join the ride. Connor would bicycle with me and help me document the journey. While he was a capable filmmaker, he wasn't much of an outdoorsman. In fact, he had never slept outside before, never camped, never done anything physically strenuous for more than a couple of hours. But there was a fire in his eyes when he talked about the trip, he was up for the adventure, and that's all I could ask for. Are you really going to Alaska on a bike? Yeah. We're not even on the road yet, and our first piece of equipment is already broken, so, good things to come. Let's cut that. If we need to cut anything. Let me see the other one. This? Cause I have I have - - And then what's that? This is the one that should be cut. Okay Connor was nervous. He was leaving everything behind. His girlfriend, Lizzie, his friends, his entire life. We're here in Battery Park City to do the ceremonial tire dunk in the Atlantic ocean. The next time we'll wet the wheel, as they say, is in the Northern Pacific. So I'm going to throw a bucket into this water because there's no way to actually dunk the back wheel. Our journey would take us through the Appalachians, the Midwest, Great Plains, Rockies, Pacific Northwest, Western Canada, and finally, Alaska. The beginning of it all was in the heart of Manhattan, where we would head west across the George Washington Bridge Time would be a factor. If we didn't make it before the early fall snow, we wouldn't be able to make it up the mountain. Ready? Go! About 10 miles down the road, the added gear-weight was too much for Connor's bike. The back wheel collapsed and his tire exploded. We were stuck. That is a much beefier tire. Lizzie rode out to keep us company as we walked five miles to the nearest hotel. So needless to say, today, did not go as planned. We are sitting in a hotel room, not the middle of a campsite. We had major bike problems today. So we took it to a guy who fixed it up and told us to stay off it for 24 hours while this adhesive sets on all of the the spokes. So now we're kind of stuck here till 4:00 PM. I think we can make it up. This is the end of day two and it has been a miserable couple of days of biking, not only were we basically stranded in a mall parking lot for 24 hours, but we also were having to deal with like, not hospitable biking conditions. Lots of turns, sidewalks, congested streets. Luckily our producer remembered that he has a friend who lived, very serendipitously, nearby, where we were trying to go for today. Early morning tomorrow, we're going to bust out our first real mile day, and I think that we're going to really, really put some miles behind us tomorrow. Agh! You okay? I am now. No, I do not have a Marriott rewards card. It's just for tonight, yeah. Okay. No, actually we're actually bicycling, and we're just trying to figure out the best way to get there. This is not how I imagined the last three days at all. Second time in three nights we're staying in a hotel, which is not, I literally thought tonight we'd be sleeping under the stars at the Delaware water gap, and it's a bit demoralizing. So, and there's, and there's just no other - And there are these hills and these ridges that these roads go up and they go down and then they go up and then they go down. Tomorrow, hopefully tomorrow it's gonna open up. Hopefully it'll open up tomorrow. I Hope. Agh! So, um, first popped tire in Jersey. Oooh, ohhh! Yeah! Oh baby! That is one hunk of glass. The early fall snow wasn't going to wait. And I was terrified of missing our window. Things were not going according to plan. We'd made it 150 miles, roughly 2% of the entire journey. And we were already having serious problems. We arrived in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, where we were staying with my friend Patrick. There, we decided to dump some of our weight to make the riding easier. I want to keep this. It's heavy, but actually I need to put film in it, I've yet to put film in it, this is my dad's camera that I found, that I want to actually use. What kind of film does it take? It takes like medium format film. Connor still wasn't doing well. The trip was starting to wear on him mentally. Ready? I wonder how much that costs? Ready? This camera's so confusing. Two, three. I know, I realized just as we were careening down the highway at about 35 miles an hour, going down the side of a mountain, I realized you can die doing this. People do this for fun! Now, if you just think of it, like you think if you were in a motorcycle, you wouldn't worry, right? Oh no, no. I'm the type to worry about that, yes. You good? I'm not great. Reaching my end of the tank of gas. Connor's discouragement was growing. This was not his element. I'm not coming in here for the night, I'm just going to try to set up my sleeping bag. I mean, for the first time, horizontal today since I woke up. How often are you horizontal? I mean, it's the first time I'm not, like, working, you know? No, I don't hurt as bad as I did. Yesterday, topography wise, was so much easier. Yeah, I don't know what today's going to be like. We did 15 more miles than we did the day before? Yesterday? We did about 45 miles yesterday. About 45 the day before. Right? So. Are you fucking serious? Are you fucking serious- when are you going to learn how to camp? Suddenly Connor's ankles began to swell and throb in pain. It didn't take long before he was unable to bike, unable to walk and unable to move. There was no going forward. I rushed ahead to get help. Connor's morale was at rock bottom. Mine was right there with him. So you guys will leave - - Do we have an appointment tomorrow? They're kind of expecting, they're kind of expecting you. Just to show up in there? No, no, no, they have our number and they're going to call. No, it's like the one place in town that we could, that you could - - Can get in tomorrow? I can't get in there the day after tomorrow? Hmm mmm When we're actually in Cleveland? No, cause it's a Saturday. Oh, that's right. Fuck. 75 miles tomorrow. And it was all stiff. And then over the course of the day, as we were biking, it got worse and worse and worse. Yeah. You've got quite a bit of swelling over here. How many days have you been biking for? We have been riding for about seven days at that point. Are you married, single, widowed, or divorced? Single Yeah, you said that you adore your girlfriend. I love my girlfriend, with every fiber of my being. Connor had family in Detroit. Stay safe. We decided that Connor would drive the rental car ahead and seek treatment there. 10 days later, when I arrived, we would decide if he could continue on. I would leave my trailer with him and continue with a lighter camera. I was left to the pieces of America that I love. What kind of lizard is it? Savannah Monitor The strange and the weird. Yeah, at least five foot. No way! Yeah. It's going to be a big hassle to feed! The quaint and historic. The students try to do your best, and then the stained glass window. The quiet and the beautiful. I pass through the Rust Belt and onto the Great Lakes. Being by myself was lonely. While Connor wasn't tough, he was fun to have around. We shared in the struggle. Being out there alone was giving me time to reflect and be honest with myself. When I was left to really think about you long enough, I got angry and I think it was totally fair of me to be so. There's anger because you left Mom, Annie, Lizzie and me. There's anger because I'm confused. And there's anger because I don't know what I can do. Looking back, I can remember times when you were deeply unhappy, but all the memories I have of you outdoors, those are the happy ones. Being alone gave me the time to think on what I could try and do to help those suffering from unimaginable pain. My thoughts were interrupted by Detroit. Which had once stood mighty, but now was abandoned in many parts of the city. I wasn't sure what to think of the place. The doctor had explained that Connor's tendon would heal. He could rejoin the ride. Oh, the Heidelberg project? Yeah. Yeah, that's where we're hopefully going to end up today or start tomorrow. When I looked at the city more carefully, I found people trying to rebuild. There were those who believed that they could rise from the ashes. Like Tyree Guyton who changed his dilapidated neighborhood into the Heidelberg project, an enormous art piece with the mission to improve the lives of citizens of the city through art. If they could continue on through all of the struggles facing them, so could we. Even though we had fallen behind schedule, we could still make it before the snow started falling at the end of September.

Luke and I are still best friends. And just like always, we're still finding ways to get into trouble. We live far apart now, but still find time for trekking and adventure. Ahhh! Luke had been planning on taking a cross-country road trip that summer, and it wasn't a hard decision for him to come and join us for a couple of months. Each night, he would camp with us and in the morning drive to the next campsite. You meant a lot to Luke. And once he heard what I was doing, there was no way he wouldn't join up. Planting season had begun, and the first sprouts were coming up. We were still on track to make it to the end before it got too cold. Whoa. Oh no. Ripped that. Must have run over something. Tore up the rubber, tore some of the strings. I don't know what that means, but - So do I get this patch on before it dries? No, let it dry. Let it tack up Best milkshakes in 1800 miles of riding. It's fantastic. The gear with me on this bike trip is similar to other travels we did with a few variations. To start, everything fits into our Burley trailer. And it's secured with straps. I pack everything into waterproof panniers, some odds and ends and maps go into my handlebar bag, like always there's a sleeping bag, pad and tent. What takes up a lot of space, is all the stuff to keep my bike tuned. A spare tire, tubes, tools, lube and lock. I don't have that many clothes, but have to have enough for any weather condition. Plenty of water bottles to stay hydrated, a cook set and stove. A first aid kit, a tarp and rope, sunglasses, a flashlight. And finally, your camera. Dad, you'd remembered it as the one you'd snap so many photos with. During the first part of the trip, I had been hesitant about pulling it out, but once I did, it helped me feel connected to you. Put the other bag in there I'm going to. Day it is? The cheese. It's a really good touch. Mmm hmm. I think that's what gives it the pizza flavor. The peppercorn though, the little pieces of peppercorn in there. It's almost too good. I've been praying for a day like today. Since we left. Winds at our backs. Winds at our backs! Flat! And once it got paved? So, it's raining outside and we're stuck in the bathroom now, No, no, it's not just raining outside. No it's pouring. You're right. It's pouring. What happened to our tent? The tents have about an inch of water in them right now. So they're flooded, legitimately flooded. So we're sleeping in the bathroom. Look where Chandler put me. Look at this spiderweb. It's a dirty moldy pipe that's full of spiderwebs is where Chandler put me. It's going to be like this all day For the next three days Our gear needed time to dry. So we took a much needed day off. I was still chasing that memory of you, but I was no closer to coming to an understanding. All I could do was keep going. That's actually my tube under the tire. So we have to make 70 miles on this tire before we hit the next bike shop. It's going to be on gravel roads. And I don't know if we're gonna make it. So we've made it 25 miles on the first layer of duct tape. It's holding pretty well. I'm going to reapply and see if we can make it another 25. And then we just have 25 more to go, and then where to bike shop, all right! We're bicycling from New York to Alaska. Are you going back too? No, just there. Just riding there. I just... almost died. I came real close to dying, real close. I shifted in front of an 18-wheeler. I blew my tire, trying to hop on to the shoulder and I fucking - I almost died. Even after that, the day didn't get any easier. I didn't think we'd make it. The tire was was on its last legs, but we made the last 20 miles, we got to Pierre. And we made it to the bike shop, got a new tire.

And I was looking forward to getting back up in the mountains. Take off packs, we'll take off shoes I've got an idea, let's go back up where that big waterfall was! Where those guys-where we saw those guys? Where that big waterfall was, yeah! Yeah, let's find that waterfall. Yes! Yes! Yes! Break? So people always want to know, why do we go up these big hills? Like what's, what's, what's it all worth it for? Continental divide. Right there. That mountain has water that flows to the Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico and then California, the Gulf of California. That's awesome. Boom. Ease Natural landscapes are just a fraction of the great wilderness that once covered North America. Now mostly tamed and transformed by human development. The fact that they exist at all, that they have survived our very human tendency to celebrate seeing vistas with private development is a gift from the leaders of the young United States who chose to designate these lands as a gift to all Americans. What up! It was an easy choice to take a break from our bikes and do a little backpacking. Oh my God! Two women, Brigitta and Jess, who we met at the trail head joined up with us. It was a nice change of pace to have some new faces around. Connor had never been in the back country before and the Tetons were a perfect place to introduce him. Surrounded by some of the most beautiful landscapes our country has to offer. You and mom always said that these lands are precious, and it had never rung more true. Seeing Connor experience them for the first time reminded me how important they were. If you ever get a debilitating disease, come out to New York Oh it's in the one in my packs. Yeah Go and get it. Is it - well, we'll get into it. Fine, don't. Not wanting the side trip to end, we headed north to Yellowstone National Park to continue hiking. Whoa, there's a lot of them. After that, we took off west to the Snake River where Connor was going to run his first whitewater. We actually might want to fill these up a little bit more. Oh, you're twisted on your right shoulder. This is made for a man not quite as tall as I. Paddle, paddle! That wasn't it! Hop back in Connor. Hop back in. Put your paddle down. There you go, there you go. That a baby, that a baby. It had scared him, but Connor accomplished something that he never thought he would. Paddle baby, paddle hard baby! Unfortunately, my body was starting to break down. All the wear and tear on my feet was taking its toll. To stop any infection, Brigitta, who was a Physician's Aid, cleaned and sterilized the wound. It's all we've got, okay? I was also exhausted. And now, sick. How ya feelin'? Not good. Yeah? Yeah. How long you've been feeling not good? Three or four days, now. You! This is not the part where you get to call the shots. This is, this is the medical part. And this is the part - - Yeah, I know I know, you're right, you're right. I know! This is the part where you take a day when me and the doc say it's time to take a day, And that's how it's going to be. Brigitta and Jess had to move on while we waited for me to get better. The side trips were fun, but they had slowed us down. Yeah, no, I met these guys about halfway through the trip. I couldn't rest for too long and tried my best to keep up our pace to stay on track. ..Oh you've still got a long way to go right? Oh, well shoot, look at where you've been! You're almost there! That are accessible but are difficult to get to.. We were weaving our way up from the Snake River Valley towards the Sawtooth Mountains. By the beginning of July, we had reached that place that was so special to you, Dad. The Highlands of Idaho. During one of our soaks, Connor and I had a long talk. We discussed his own struggles with depression, and he helped me understand what it's like to live with the sickness. He told me that he had come along with me to shake his life up and get out of the rut he had been in. It was a struggle for him, but it was working. It was the height of summer. And I was on the trip of a lifetime trying to find you. Things felt right. The next step was to go where we last left you. I was following you into the Salmon River. This is Dagger Falls. It's where we spread my dad's ashes. It's nice to come back here. I haven't been back here since we did it, and yeah, it's a special place. It's the start of the Middle Fork River. It's, um, it's just a really special place for my dad, it felt really important to pass through here on this trip because I don't know when the next time that I'll be out here again, this is really it. This is pretty nice to be back here. As you well know, Dad, it's located in the middle of the largest undeveloped area in the lower 48 states. The river is one of the most special natural places in our country. It was where you had been a guide with Canyons Rafting all those years, and where I feel I partially grew up. When you get a chance, we'll go look at the river this morning here. And it's going to feel like a tiny little creek, but by the time we finish it's a nice, big, beautiful river in a deep, deep canyon. Being on that river made me think that everything would turn out right. Excellent. Thank you, sir. And the way things were going, it seemed to be the truth. Until suddenly... it wasn't. Whoa! You okay Luke? No You all right? No! Doing okay? Yes? No, my knee! Oh my God! ♪ Put your fears down on my chest ♪ ♪ And your heart ain't nothin' but the best ♪ It was my trip, my journey, but it wasn't me who fell off that rock. Luke's knee was gone.

Perhaps it was better to let you drift into the recess of my memories, where I wouldn't be putting those around me in danger. However. I had come too far to stop, but I didn't know if anyone else should be attempting this with me. So Connor and I talked. I reminded him the danger associated with the trip. And that I would do my best to make sure he didn't get hurt, but could not promise safety. If he wanted to continue on, he should. But, if there was any sort of doubt in his mind, he shouldn't feel like I was forcing him to stay. I reminded him that he had already made an incredible journey in every sense of the word. And if he wanted to go home, he had my blessing. He said he would ride to Seattle and make his decision there. Hitting milestones all over the place. Over three months of riding, Connor had become a new man. He had come to embrace the adventure itself, not just the journey or the project. He was confident, self-sufficient, comfortable and more fit as we crossed up through Oregon and into the Pacific Northwest. We took a day off and rested in Portland and enjoyed the city. The two of us biked another 700 miles and lived life on the road to the fullest. And in what some way seemed like the blink of an eye, we had crossed the country by our own power and were looking at the waters of the Pacific. Again Again. Get more jazzed, dude. Look at this! I am jazzed! This is me jazzed! This isn't you jazzed. There were a lot of factors weighing his final decision: girlfriend, family, exhaustion, and homesickness, but it was time for him to make a choice. Connor had already come 3,300 miles with over 3000 more to go. In the end, I'll never know exactly why he left, but I respected his decision. He'd come to battle some of his own demons, and I'd like to believe he'd won. Ahead of me lay 3000 miles of Canadian North. And from here on out, I'd be bicycling solo. Hey guys, my name is Peter Garafolo. I'm a filmmaker from the Washington DC area. And this is my first vlog... In Connor's place, my friend Peter would come out and help document the last part of the journey. on my way to join Chandler Wild.. Nice. Yeah. Homer's as far as west as you can go, and then it's a short jump over an inlet and then the peninsula kind of continues out and there's a spit of land that's there in the states, and they have this board that allows you to like petition to name a non-named geographic feature. Deep in British Columbia, I came across Jonathan, a farmer who is self-sustaining and in deep mountain valley. I traded farm chores for food and shelter. There's some. Ugh! The sledgehammer hit my finger with full force. I didn't know if I was hurt badly, but there was no going back.

There's repair, reconstruction, salvage were the three paths we talked about. We're already two and a half weeks into it. And so if we're going to try to do that first path, the repair path, boy, we got to get right on it. Now, the second path is called reconstruction. The reconstructive procedure in this case would be an osteotomy. That's where the bone is healed so much, you can't scrape it out, but you could cut it and you cut it with a saw. We have clever little saws that will cut things. And then you move the piece where you want it to be and you clamp it in place, put some screws in. There are some problems that we have that have no backup plan, okay? And if you get screwy then you lose stuff, okay? I made the choice to keep going. My finger would have to wait, even if it meant permanent damage. Damn it! The journey was wearing on me, not just physically, but the mental battle of riding solo for so long was weighing me down. If I was going to make it to the top of that mountain, I needed help. Four years before this ride, Jared and I had met on the road. We've remained close friends, taking a bike trip together every couple of years. As soon as he heard I was struggling, he jumped on a plane to come join me. He had also lost someone close, his mom 10 years before, and connected to what I was trying to do for you. Another friend and my editor, Kevin, would join us for the final stretch. Like Connor before him, this was also his first backpacking trip. Up high like that, and then down. Alaska, Alaska, Down, Hm.. hm.. hm! Ding, ding, ding! Oh, we go through Happy Valley tomorrow. The end was near. After five months of riding, we were one day away from taking the last pedal. ♪ Hmmmm, mmmm ♪ ♪ I'm on my way ♪ ♪ Yes, I'm on my way ♪ ♪ Hmmmm, mmmm ♪ ♪ I'm on my way ♪ Congratulations, brother. Then, just like that, Dad, there was no more road. Well, after a very full day of hiking and camp chores and children, I won't have any problem at all sleeping tonight. Goodnight. I dipped my tires in the waters of the Pacific. I had bridged North America, by road. My ride may have been over, but the mountains still remained, looming across the bay, calling. We provide company and conversation. No, these are getting sauteed and tossed into the veggies, so like.. Some locals invited us over for a salmon feast. No, we're not hibernating. And showed us what an Alaskan Friday night was all about. You got four buddy. You're going to get four shots. Jordan gets three. Julie gets three. We're good. Yup. This is going to be bad. Leftie! Yeah, hell yeah! Leftie! We had chartered a boat to take us across the bay to the base of the range. Your mountain was two miles inland. Just close enough that I was planning on it being a nice, easy walk to the top. So that's us right there. What we're looking for is a creek which I think is... the other thing, the creek might be the... might have the most we'll have to bushwhack through as well. The plan was to take two days to get to the top. The creek is just a good frame of reference because it takes us.. So we can get like a gist of where we are. I'd recommend a sleeves down guys. It's about to got to get spiky. Woo! The dense underbrush was extremely difficult to move through. The majority of the plants were lined with thorns, making walking even more difficult. By the end of day one, we had made very little progress. I had not prepared for this. I had never wanted a machete more. Are you ready to sleep in the tent tonight? First time ever. First tent. Yeah! Here's the thing - I'm going to need you to come right now to Alaska. We're going to walk through the bush. All right, let's do this! Somehow missed a river that we were trying to get to, to fill up water... so we have no more water. We have a little bit. Right now, we're actually collecting rainwater because it just never stops raining here. I've been sick as a dog all day, but I think I'll be better tomorrow. I hope. Behind us is as Jakolof Bay, right? We should be heading, trying to head due south. It became clear very quickly that I had chosen the wrong way up. The slope became too steep and the undergrowth too thick. There was no choice except go down to where we started. I cannot conceptualize not getting up there, but at the same time, it's becoming very much the reality of the situation. Now I was becoming worried about time. We had a plane picking us up from the opposite side of the mountain on the morning of day six. The game plan was to attempt another approach. This time starting from the north and heading south. We found a bear trail that cut through some of the thicker underbrush and followed it straight up the front of the mountain. We need a very specific climate situation here. Starting to get cold and breezy. Getting above tree line. By the end of the day, we had made it a good ways up and were set to make it to the top early the next day. What had started as a crazy dream was somehow becoming a reality. No, I kinda want to push past this brushy stuff, get out in a little more open. At least find some water, you know? We've gotta keep our composure! That's a big pile of poo. Because we were following their trail, the bears were out. So we hung our bags out of their reach. I think we're the only ones crazy enough to be up here. So this is kind of our view. We were primed to finish the journey on a beautiful day. A drizzle became a downpour and stopped any attempt we were making at the top. When we heard thunder, it was time to rush back to camp, which was incredibly hard to do. It was pouring down rain today. We were on the verge of hypothermia, 40 degrees. Couldn't make it to the top of the first peak to get to Lawrence. Game plan tomorrow, wake up, attempt to do it again, but, we need a day and a half to get down. I've come all this way. And then literally at the, not even the foot or like the base, but like at the end of summit, you know? It's not like a - this isn't Mount Everest. This isn't some crazy technical mountain, but it's still, you know, the weather is just terrible. I don't think I had any indication from the beginning that it would necessarily be easy. Tomorrow's day five, which means tomorrow is the last chance we have to get to the top. Oh wait, we didn't actually filter, did we? Want to do it? Today is the day! Let's do it. The weather had cleared up enough for us to push to the top End of the road. Right there, you see it? ♪ Hmmmm, mmmm ♪ Let's do it! This is it, huh? The storm's about to fucking kick our ass. The storm's about to wreck us up. We got maybe, what? Two more minutes here? I wish, I mean, honestly I wish I felt something more euphoric, you know? Something, some kind of like end of the rainbow moment, but I feel accomplished, I feel - I feel accomplished, I feel like I did something, but, that's the thing, I don't know. I don't know how my dad would feel. I don't know how... I dunno. It's something I've been like, trying to figure out. I know I was hoping standing up here, kind of on top of the world. Yeah. I just feel like there's something else to, I don't know, I was hoping like right here, it would be a break in the clouds moment. You know, literally an answer to a question. I'll take this little sprinkle and enjoy the fact that there are no bugs hovering around our faces right now. That's pretty awesome right there. So, we left the mountain. The place where I thought I'd find you, and had spent six months working towards, which left me wondering - if not there, where was I going to find you? The question ran through my mind, as I said goodbye to Jared, as he boarded a plane back east. And as I went under the knife to try and salvage my finger. And I kept repeating the question over and over as the 6,700 miles of concrete flew under me in a car. I looked for something along the road to give me an answer, but I found none. I settled back into New York and resumed my life.

I sorted through hours and hours of home video, looking for something, anything, to make sense out of the past six months of my life. Among that footage, I saw a pattern starting to emerge. I had imagined my ride to be a solo one, and the journey my own. But after looking at all those home videos, Dad, I was struck that none of them were of you alone, in all of them, you were taking people out there. Never once did you venture out there just for yourself. You knew what outdoor adventure had given you, and you wanted to share that. For you, the most important thing was about sharing that journey. You weren't waiting for me on top of that mountain to show me an answer. You were with me the whole journey, showing me it was about the people I was with. Connor is busy since he returned, except now, he's the one leading. These might not even be like real memories. I remember my knee coming up, floating up out of the water and seeing it for the first time, like somebody had just smashed it with a hammer. What's, you know, what's going on? How can we fix it? All right, my knees busted. Thankfully, after extensive rehab, Luke healed his knee. I'll make it out of here, it's gonna be fine. I was floatin' dude! And she came back, she's like "you're okay, you're okay!" Cause you're supposed to like, tap your head, when you're in the water to let the guides know you're okay. She was trying to get me to tap my head, she was like, "you're okay, you're okay" And I go, "No! No, not okay!" And she - I remember the look on her face. I mean, we'd been talking about taking a trip like this for half a decade, and been talking about this specific trip for like two years. And dude, I wouldn't change anything about what happened at all. I mean, I still feel like we need to go and take another trip as soon as we can. Like, we got to get out of the city. We need to go and do something. Jared and I are planning our next trek already because with him, there will always be another adventure. In life and adventure, Mom showed me the ropes as much as you.

For you. ♪ Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh ♪ Well, the trip's over, we did make it back, and just like Judy, very proud of the kids, all of us for doing it. It's definitely the most ambitious family event project that we've done before, so we're expanding the envelope, our horizons, doing trips like this. I think it's been a real big learning experience for the kids, and I think it's something that'll carry over to them for other things they do in life. They know they've done something this ambitious, they can conquer other worlds. All that seriousness aside, I think they did have fun seeing all the outdoors and all the little critters they did.
