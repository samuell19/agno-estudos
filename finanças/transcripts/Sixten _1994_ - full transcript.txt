I knew it. Although I didn't say anything. Thought he could figure it out himself. It's quite hard to fix a washing machine. Mum should have called someone right away. Two. Three. Yes, three weeks since it broke. All the parts are on the bathroom floor. Sorry, I'll be right back. Hello, it's me. - It's Dad. - Hi. - You see the time? Aren't you asleep? - No, I'm not. - You're not playing with matches, are you? - What? - Matches? - No, I was asleep. - That's good. Remember what I said about the wall plugs? - Yes, yes, don't worry. - Yes, there was something else I— - The hotplates. - What? - The hotplates. - Yes, that was it, they're off, yes? - Dad, I like being by myself at night. - Yes, yes. So now, lie down and go straight to sleep. Hear me? - By the way, Mum called. - What was up with her, then? - It doesn't look like she's coming now either. Should I call her? - I love you. - Bye. - Yes, bye. - Bye. - Sleep well, Sixten. - Bye. - Dad's hanging up now. He's quite anxious. He seems to think I miss Mum all the time. But I don't. Not all the time. It's important to keep him calm, in every possible way. Eat well and laugh a lot. They like that. Come on now, Sixten! Food's ready. - I'll be there in a sec. - What weather, eh? Summer's here. Let's have a look at you. Up you get. - What? - What the hell are you wearing? - What? - You can't wear these clothes to school. - Why not? - Darling, it's summer now, scorching hot. You'll sweat to death. They'll laugh at you. You'll get teased. - Why? - Because of the clothes. They're winter clothes, Sixten. - Dad, no one's going to tease me. Anyway, everyone dresses like this. It's the fashion right now. You sleep during the day, so you don't notice anything. This is great! - Full up now? Or do you want some more? - A fried egg, maybe. I have to go now. - What about your egg? - Jonte's waiting. Bye! - Bye. - Bye. Dad's watching. You skip a bit as well. Jump on! - Are you crazy? - Dad would die. No helmet or anything. - Are you dressing up today? - All my clothes are dirty. The washing machine's broken. - Why haven't you told your Dad then? - I have. Everyone's gonna crack up. - Never mind. You think Beethoven cared what he wore? - Beethoven probably didn't have ski-pants. Fucking idiot. - What about you? - Wimp! - Wimpy arse! Hi. - Bell 's gone. - I'll be along later. - You coming then? - I'll show you a real old treat. - Sure, I'll come when Dad's left for work. - See you later. - Thought we should have a little game. You're in goal. Screw you! Fucking idiot! You fucking turd. Sit there and think about what's gona happen when you come out! - I'll think of you when I flush. - Arne! Get the ball! Stop! Stop playing! Out! Have they been after you again? - No, I just went to the bathroom. Come on. - Vite vite, Sixten! So where's your ski boots, then? Okay, kids. We're going to practice for the finale. Bobo too. Arne. Caps off. ♪ The time of flowers is coming ♪ with beauty and delight. ♪ sweet summer is approaching ♪ when grass and crops grow ♪ with gentle and living warmth ♪ to everything lying dead— - Look, it's snowing, just look, it's snowing, it was fun, haha— Check out Sixten, then. He's got ski boots on. - Tell Sixten he can wear a woolly hat. - Enough! Any more of that kind of stupidity, I'll be pissed off. Understood? Okay, let's hear how it'll sound tomorrow. You're a big, fucking piece of cow shit, Bobo. - Now you're in a heap of trouble. Damn. - Lost something? Come on. Aren't you going home too? - Anything I can help you with? Books or something? - Yes, you can help me with this. I hate drawing. Draw something. - A cow? - Yes, that'd be good. Sixten. Why are you really wearing these clothes? - I'm just trying them on. I'm going to Greenland with my Mum during the summer holidays. She lives in Denmark, you know. But they're too small. Very lucky I tried them, actually. - Is everything okay? - Is there anything you'd like to tell me? Well? - No, I'll get there. I'm going to go. Bye then, miss. What are you doing? - Nothing. - That's so cool! - What? - The clothes. Were you waiting for me? - Shh. You'd better be on your way. - Yes, right. We're going swimming later, yeah? - Definitely. Off you go! - Bye, Sixten! - Where the hell is he? Is that you? - Yes. You can go back to sleep. - So how was school today, then? - Good. Great, actually. - Hold on, I'll help you. What's that? Who did that to you? - Nobody. No one did anything. - Nothing? That's a world-class fat lip! You think I can't recognize a fat lip? Let me have a look. Who did this? Sixten, who beat you up? - What d'you mean? No one beat me up. - I'm going to call the school. Shall I? - Please, Dad. No one's fighting. We were only playing football. - Football? - But the lip? - I was in goal. Then I saw the guy on the other team break. The others didn't have a chance. It was just him and me. What the hell should I do? He was only five meters from goal. He got closer and closer— and I rushed forward and dived at him just as he was about to strike. I got the ball! Yes! And it hit me on the lip. - You got it? - Of course. Should I have let it go in, or what? - What a save! What a boy I have! Give me the ball! Come on now! Are you ready now? Come on Sixten! Come on! Come on, come on, come on! Shot coming from the left! Here it comes, he breaks free, he shoots— Doesn't matter. I'll mend it later. Sixten! Are you still in there? - Yes I'm here. - Have you got a stomach ache? - No. - Do you know how many times to chew each bite? - Sixty five! I'm just doing a little laundry. You should fix the washing machine. You should get someone to do it. - Certainly. Soon. I have to go now. Good night! - Good night! - You're not going anywhere now, are you? - No. - No, no. - Dad! My bike is too small. But it helps if I attach the stabilisers. - Bye. Kiss. - Kiss. Fassbinder. - Hello! - Hello! - Something else? Godard, Fellini? - No, I just wanted to return this weird film. I'll have a pack of smokes though. - I've got to show Sixten something. Then I'm taking the rest of the day off. - Again? - Yes. But I'll be back. - I've heard that before. So, is that all? You see? That's love, that is. Here a couple uses the traditional position where the man lies on top. But it doesn't have to be that way. On the contrary, there are some positions that are better. And it doesn't have to be the same position— Come on, let's buzz off. Come on then! Can you sleep over? - No, I have to be at home when Dad calls. You know what he's like. If I don't answer, he'll go crazy. - You just can't have that. You never get to do anything. Does he think you're a baby, or what? - He is what he is. - He should fucking get married. - What? - He needs to get a wife. He needs a little sweetheart. So he has something else to think about. - Forget it. That's no use. He doesn't care about women, Jonte. I promise you. - He just hasn't met the right one. - And just how do you do that? - How? We'll fix it. All right? Want to hear my latest poem? - Yes. Love to. - Never felt a woman's lips against mine. A night when the bunches of lilacs burn like stars up above. And never felt the blood so hot that the moon fades in the sky. Sixten! Hurry up! - What? - Hurry up! We'll be late. - Yeah yeah, I'll be there soon. Here you are, Miss. Go on then, Sixten. - Say hello to Miss first. - Look. I put on what I wanted today too. - Nice. - See you at the lake later. - Great. Well, this is my father. - Yes, I gathered that. Hello. - Hello. - A good summer to you both, then. - Yes, same to you. - Dad boxed when he was younger. A lot, actually. He's thirty-nine now. Well, at least he will be next week. That's not so old. - No, not at all. - Right, we need to get on our way. - Do you like to dance, Miss? - Yes. - That's something you could do together. Dad, I like to be by myself at night. You know that. I just think it's cosy to be on your own. - I think so too, Sixten. - It's probably best we go now, yeah? - But I just have one thing to say to Miss. - Ok, I can wait outside. As long as you don't think it was me who— Have a good summer! - What did you want? - Have you found my shoe? - Ah yes. - Thanks. - Have a good summer! - Have a good summer! - Wow, great skill! - Come on Dad, let's go. - Nice! Why did you say that about dancing? - No, it was just something I came up with. - I don't know when I last danced. It must have been ages ago. - If I don't go to Mum's on your birthday, I'll stay at home. What do you want, Dad? - I don't know. Just a surprise. What was that? "The Sailor and the Star" Girod. - Dad doesn't care about love. - He probably just doesn't know what it is. - What is it, then? - Come on. I'll show you - Where's the salt? - Next to the stove. Hello! Who's there? - Hi, only us. Maybe you could tell me a little about this one. - 22, Truffaut, an incredibly good film. It's about life, and longing for the sea. A lad who steals a typewriter. Hallo? - Fifty percent. You too, fifty percent. - Damn sad, wonderful film. - Same for you. Fifty percent. - Truffaut. Love is not being able to take your eyes off each other. You drown in each other's eyes, can't get enough. There's nothing you can't talk about. Nothing you can't do. Until everything else just disappears. - Understand? - Yeah, but we're going now. Let's get out of here! What the hell are we supposed to do here? - Swim. Dad's working the day shift now. - Yeah. At least I brought this with me. It's just a matter of choosing. - Choosing what? - A woman. Someone for your Dad to marry. - There's as many as you could want. Look! - Do they all want to get married? - Yes, every single one. Listen to this: Beautiful middle-aged vegetarian with a positive outlook on life seeks real man. Reply to Box 2591. - But Dad loves chicken. - Of course we won't take the first one to come along. We're going to go through the whole bunch. Here. Well-formed girl who wants to have a good time. Looking for company for the cinema and life. I'm sensual and you're tall. Preferably a man in uniform. Send photo. Reply to Box 2623. - Well, Dad's certainly got a uniform. - She'll be perfect. - Let's go for 2623. - Sixten! - Okay then. Oh, look! He's wearing a royal robe. O king. Is the father of diamonds safely locked up in Togo now? Yes thanks to you, Tarzan, son of the apes. Sleep well, Sixten. - Dad? What's sensual? - Sensual? Well, it's— Why do you ask? - No, it was just something I thought of. - Well, I know what it is but I'm not sure— - But is it something good? - Yes, it is. - Right. - Wait, I'll look it up. - Dad! Now I know exactly what to get for your birthday present. Something very special. - Right, here we are. Sensual: carnal, pleasurable, lascivious. Sleep well, Sixten. Come on then, Sixten. Send a letter to the newspaper and they'll pass it on to her. Stop that! - There's just one little problem. It won't work. - What won't work? - Dad would never write a letter like that. - He's not going to write it. - Who is? - Who do you think? There, or there— We'll get somewhere here, yeah? - Right at the back. So they can be by themselves. - No, you can see better from the middle. - Well— Excuse me? Excuse me! - Excuse me! - Do you have anything left in the middle? - Yes, we have. How many do you want? - Two. - Hold on. - Miss! Come on now, Sixten! - So which is which? - Does it matter? - We should send the nicest one. It's important to find the right tone. I think I've got it. It probably shouldn't be too long. She doesn't seem the literary type. I'll just write about the rose and the uniform. - You think she'll come, then? - Hello! - Let's see. - What're you doing? Can I join in? - Out! No, spit! No. Three times! For luck! Are you ready? - Yes. -One, two, one, two, three, four. ♪ Yes, may he live, yes, may he live ♪ yes, may he live to a hundred years ♪ yes, sure he'll live, yes sure he'll live Dad! Wake up! Quick! - What a parcel! Cake! And a St. Paulia! I love those so much! And sponge cake. That's lovely! But come on. What can this be? It's so exciting! Is it nothing at all? - No! Go on! Congratulations, Dad, on your birthday. On your 39th birthday. Hip, hip, hooray! Thank you! I don't understand why I have to wear the uniform. It's so silly. - It's your birthday, Dad. - Just one more thing. - mm sweets. - Uh-uh!! Save them for the cinema. - Am I all right now, then? - Yes. - You can't do a lot more. - Don't forget it's numbered. And you've got the ticket, yeah? - Yes! - Bye! - Now it's on fire. She hasn't shown up. - No. Excuse me. Here she comes. - She doesn't look so bad, eh? - Hello. Sorry I'm late. - Yes, it doesn't matter. Aren't you going to sit down? - Do you like movies like this? - Yes. - What's she saying? - I can't hear. - He actually looks like you. Like in the photo, you know. - Thanks. Maybe we should watch the film. - She's saying something about the film. This is actually the first time I've done anything like this. It feels a little edgy. Where are you going? - To the toilet. - Do you want me to come with you? - No thanks. - I don't understand any of this. He's just leaving. - You really think so? - Yes. Shit. I have to get ahead of him or he'll go crazy. - Look! But it doesn't matter. Maybe I shouldn't have said anything. But that's a totally new experience!. At least I got to see the beginning. Yes, it's the best part. Mum might come next week. - Don't say that if you're not sure! - No, that's true. Sleep well, darling. Thanks for today. - Don't turn off the light! Come on then, Sixten! Of course you can try again. There's plenty left. - Just stop it now. - Try someone else. Try the vegetarian. - Dad doesn't want just anyone. And neither do I. That was a very stupid idea. - I was only trying to help you. - I don't need your help. - Sixten— - Take this and piss off. Hear me? Go home and write some more idiotic poems! - Well, you can go on being a fake friend, same as your father. And I thought we might go to the cinema next week. The open-air cinema. What do you want now, then? - Shall we go swimming? - Sixten is a turd! - Come on!! Run the others down. Turn your bike around! You missed one. Where are we going? - Just go on up. Ok, we're leaving. That's enough for today. Let's go. - Shit. Long way down. - Look at my Mum, how small she is. - My Mum's getting a divorce. - What? Aren't they divorced already? - Yes, I mean from her new one. - I've hardly ever met my father. - Haven't you? Strange— Are we going to the cinema next week? - Yes, of course. - Open air? - Yeah. - Emma! Get down from there! - Look! Sixten! - Emma! - Got you, you bastard. - Get down from there! Come on! - Emma! Get down from there now! - Yes, I'm coming now. Yes, but that's something you have to decide for yourself. You can understand that. Yes, it's clear he's getting a bit too big. Yes. No, we can talk another time. Yes. Yes, let's do that. Bye. - Who was that? - Mum. Want some juice? - No thanks. - Sure? - No, I don't want anything. What did she say? - It seems everything's sorted itself out. She's calmed down, we're friends again. - Yeah? - She sends greetings. Shall we do something together? You and me. - No, I think I'm going to bed now. - Ok, go on. Don't forget to brush your teeth. - She won't be coming, will she. - No. You're not even dressed yet? Come on now. - There. Hurry up. - Where are we going? - You'll see. - Shouldn't we have breakfast? - We're going to eat out today. Bring the small first-aid kit. Now! What do you think? Hand brake, foot brake, lights, reflectors, gears, new bell. - Nice. Nice colour. Except it's for girls. - It just has no frame. So you don't crush your scrotum when you slip on the pedals. - Thanks. Right here, out with your arm! Left here, out with your arm! We have to do this again. To get away. Away from everything. See the cows? Cows calm you down. I think it's something about the eyes. Big and brown, somehow. We should be cows, Sixten. If I could wish what to be in the next life, I'd be a cow. They never worry. They eat. Wave the flies away, sleep, shit. They don't worry about what the hell's to come. I'm doing my best. I'm worried. I sometimes feel like I'm getting it wrong. That I'm not enough. It's not so easy when you're alone with no one to talk to, you know, Sixten. Sixten? What are you thinking about? Aren't you happy? - Dad, have you never thought of getting married again? - Married? No. Why? - Mum did it. - Mum, yes. - I have you. We're fine the way we are. Aren't we? Damn. What am I supposed to do now then? My bus driver's shirt. I can't leave it like this. - Take it to the dry cleaners. Maybe you should fix the washing machine. - Yes. Yes, I'll call later. - Yeah yeah. Close the door. You've got a girls' bike? Cool! - What the hell have you got at the back? - His underpants. - But what's that brown spot on them? - Cow shit. - Fuck off! Fucking idiot! Hello. You've reached the voicemail of Eva— Yes, hi Mum. Larsen. We are not— So you won't be coming then? —leave a message, you can do that after the beep. Bye! I just wanted to say good night. My Mum's always so worried. She always thinks something dangerous is going to happen. - She's divorced, isn't she? - Yes. Although she's having a baby in September. - Who with? - We don't know. - That'll probably make it better anyway. - What? - Maybe you'll get to do a bit more of what you want. - Yes. Are you going to come for me tomorrow? - Yes. Of course. It probably shouldn't be that far. Oh what the hell. Jonte. - Yeah, hi. It's me. - Hello. - Yeah, just wondering if we can meet. - Well, I don't know. There's a lot to do in the store. You have to show some support for the blind too, you know. - Are you coming to the cinema, then? - No. Not sure. - Well, I'm going anyway. Maybe I'll bring someone with me. - Yeah, well, maybe we'll see each other then. - Bye. - Bye. Hello! Who's there? - It's Sixten, Jonte's friend. Isn't Jonte here? - No, I never know where he is. - Can you see anything at all? - Well, I still see what I remember. In here. And the light. - Will you never be able to see again, properly? - Well, when it gets completely dark they can operate. Then I'll go to the cinema every damn night. Well, whoever lives will see. Maybe you could come and give me a hand in the evenings now and again. - No, I'm afraid that won't work. Dad would never agree to it. - Well, it'll be fine, Sixten. Right, I'm off now. You're not going anywhere, are you? - No. Bye! - Kiss! - Kiss, kiss! - Bye! Too late. Unfortunately. - Didn't we book? - It's full. - Piss off! What the hell! - Ladies first. - To begin with I thought you were just like all the rest. But now I don't think that at all. Sorry, Jonte. I didn't mean what I said about your poems. - It's okay. - It was stupid. You were actually right. We're trying to find Dad a new woman. This time I choose. - Shh. It's coming! I like you, Sixten. - Me too. Sixten? I am a 35-year-old very ordinary girl who is tired of being bored. That's why I'm looking for a crazy guy who can dance and make me laugh. Dancing Feet. That one. We'll have that one. - A very ordinary girl. What's fun about that? - Maybe just something you think at the start. Show me you can write poems. Something like this, maybe. - Put that it's urgent. Read it, then! - Hello! You who call yourself 'Dancing Feet'. I'd like to meet you. Maybe I'm crazy enough. And dancing is my greatest pleasure. My footwork is good because I used to box. Now I drive a bus. I love driving a bus at night. Then the moon shines over the city's dark streets. Then thousands of stars sparkle like pearls. And candles still burn in the windows of the lonely. Then it's a shame if you don't have anyone to talk to about all the beautiful things. If only you could come with me. I'd be glad to offer you a ticket. I also have a little boy, called Sixten. He is also very much looking forward to meeting you. Yours, Benny Antonsson. PS It's urgent. Sorry, kid. Nothing today either. Only for Dad. - Thanks. - Who was that? - Nobody. - What's up? What's that? - The Million Lottery, The chance to win. A million! Food Heaven. and here's ICA. Co-op. and Ivar's broiler chicken, special price. - Lovely! Where are you off to? - Out. Just out. She writes that she liked the letter, Jonte. - Maybe she's not so bad after all. - She wants them to meet, for real. - Yes, I suppose they have to. - She likes going by bus too. - Yeah? - Yeah. It would be fun to ride your bus at night, she says. She wants Dad to call if he's still interested. - Well, you should probably talk to your Dad so he does. - He'll never do that. - Oh yes, he will. What do you think of her, then? It's Madonna. - Oh yes. - She has beautiful eyes, eh? - Would you like to live with her? - Sorry? - Well, the most important thing isn't what she looks like. - The most important thing is having someone your age you can really talk to. - About music , poetry, stuff like that. - Someone you can dance with. And laugh with. - What are you talking about? - We thought—you should call. - Where? - Someone who fixes washing machines. - Yes, yes, I will. I'll do it now. I'll call right away. But who on earth do I call? - There are ads for almost everything in the newspapers. - You're not stupid, are you. You take after me. I'll do it now. - What did I say? It'll never work. We'll have to call ourselves, Jonte. - Are you crazy? She'll notice right away it's not your Dad. - Where's the phone book? - It's a national code. We should be able to— She's probably not at home. - Course she is! - Dammit, she's answering. What do I say? What do I say! - Tell her to come here. - Yes, hello. Hi. It's Benny Antonsson. The bus driver, you know? Yes, right. Thanks for your letter. It was a very nice letter. And that—not to say— I just have a bit of a sore throat. No no, not a problem. But I probably can't talk for long. Can you come here? Can you come here? Yes, I put the address in the letter. On Friday? - Yes! Yes! Yes! - Yes, that's great. You can stay with us. We have several rooms, so it 'll be fine. - Yes, yes, yes! - Yes, then that's settled. I think so too. It'll be fun. Don't expect too much. I'm not that crazy. No, now I think I need to rest my voice a bit. See you then. Bye. Bye-bye. Tomorrow. Help! Tomatoes! Mushrooms! Chicken! Oil's over there. Bread! Get that long one. Coffee bread! Cola! We forgot the cola! And candles. There. - Are you having a party? - Put this on Dad's account. What have you got for a tenner? - Yes. This? - No. - Hang on. I have a bouquet that's been in the window. You can have that. - Thanks. Glasses, china, plates. - Use the ones with the gold rim. - You cut the bread. Put it where it won't go stale. - Where's the cutlery? - In the top drawer. - Help. Get the candles and the flowers. - Where are the glasses? - In the cupboard. - Coffee. We'll do that later. - The cola. Cola's in the fridge. - Right then. - No. -Thanks. Did you forget the cookies? - Have we got everything? - We forgot the almonds! -No. Here they are. He's coming. - Good God, what a day. - Dad, there's something we should probably tell you. - It's quite urgent, actually. - Later. Later. I need a shower. - But Dad— I wish he'd get a move on. - We should have said something before. -The washing machine! He was supposed to mend it today. - Here I am. Am I too early? - Excuse me, I— - Yes, it's me who— Shall I come in? - Sorry I was waiting for someone else. I replied to an advert. I thought you were here about that. - But I am! - Oh really. Right then, go ahead. - We've looked forward to this a long time. - Thanks, that's nice to hear. Well. And which of you is Sixten? Hello. - Do you know him? - No, but I hope to have the opportunity to do so soon. - Well, please forgive the outfit. I'm a bus driver. - Shall we go then? - Go? - I'll show you the machine. See if you can do something about it. - Where are you going? -To the washing machine, of course. It's been broken for ages now. I really hope you can fix it. - Me? - Yes, of course. - Yeah— - Yes, you must excuse me. I really didn't expect someone like you. - Is that so? What did you expect then? - Different. To be honest, I was expecting a man. - A man? - Yes, but it doesn't matter. - No— - Come on then! See if you can do something about it. - Dad— - Later, Sixten. I have to show her the washing machine. It's ready now. Where should I put it? - Doesn't matter any more. - What have you been up to? - We just wanted to help you. - It was me. - The wrench, Benny! - Coming. We'll talk later. - It'll probably be all right. - No. - Yes it will. Hello. Is this where the broken washing machine is? - Yes, well it was. But it's working now. It fixed itself. - Oh, good. - It just started by itself. Listen! - Yes. - But thanks for coming anyway. It's great! - Just needs a fine tune! - Wonderful! - If you'll excuse me, I think I have to go and change. - You can use my room. - That lady at the cinema. Was she your idea too? - We didn't want you to be alone, Dad. - No more now. And listen. Not a word to Anna. - So no one could look through the keyhole. That was the best thing I've eaten in a long time. You know, I understood right away there was something special about you. You still have the child inside you. - Yes, maybe. - And that thing you wrote. About the candles that burn in the windows of the lonely. - That was lovely! - Yeah— - Yes, that's probably how I was feeling at the time. Usually I don't write much. But I'm very glad you came. - You haven't forgotten your promise? To take me on your bus at night. I love driving a bus at night. Then the moon shines over the city's dark streets. Then thousands of stars sparkle like pearls And candles still burn in the windows of the lonely. Then it's a shame if you don't have anyone to talk to about all the beautiful things.
