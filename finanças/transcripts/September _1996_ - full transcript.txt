Angus and I are planning a dance -for Katy's 21st. -Oh, yes. And I'm thinking of inviting Pandora. Pandora? Do you ever hear from Pandora? Occasionally. The odd postcard, you know. Verena Steynton's planning to invite her to the dance. What? She can't do that. If she does, who'd tell Edmund? Uh, I thought you might have heard there's to be a guest of honor... Pandora. Here? -Look what I've got. -What's that? An invitation to a ball. That must be Verena's invitation, to the dance. Then, two more of the same, one for Lucilla and another for Pandora to be forwarded. I told Verena it was not a good idea. What times they were, eh? You still married to Caroline? And Pandora buzzing about like a bee after honey and then running off. But then, she was always a bit of a bad penny. [Pandora] That's what you call it, a problem? Don't you understand, Archie? I am having a baby. It's true. Archie said she'd never come back. Well, she is. Pandora? Who knows with Pandora? Oh, Vi, I do hope there isn't gonna be trouble. Where are the horses? Where are the horses? -Welcome home. -Archie. [laughs] I'm so happy to see you. And to be back, it's so wonderful. [dramatic music playing] Why did you come back? After all, you won't be staying long, will you, Pandora? Just till the dance, I suppose. [Constable] All right, lads, you pack now. What did you think, accident, was it? -No. -What did they reckon? [Sergeant] No, they won't say, difficult to tell at this stage. One thing's for certain. It was no accident. [birds chirping] [Pandora] I told you not to call me here. I don't want you checking up on me, Carlos. [Carlos over phone] I'm not checking up on you. -I just want to know why. -Why? [Carlos] Yes, why? You know it's dangerous. -Look, I can handle it. -[Carlos] Can you, really? What did you expect to achieve? -I have things to settle here. -[Carlos] Pandora, -you're playing with fire. -Don't call me again. -Don't call me again. -[Carlos] But Pandora, I-- As you wish, but I hope you're not going to regret it. Isobel? Isobel? Is Archie around? Am I interrupting? No, of course not. [gasps] I didn't know you could do this. [Archie] Uh-uh. Do you have others? Yes, you do. Oh, Archie. -Have you sold any? -No. Did you try? -Who would buy them? -Americans, darling. Just put them out on display, you'll make a fortune. Not at the rate I work. Find someone to help you. You could start a cottage industry. There's plenty of room in the stables here. Oh, not with the nearly pristine safety regulations, all kinds of things. You've got to find a way to raise money. Don't be so hopeless. Archie, whether you... have one leg or two, you can't just turn your back on people who love you. You speak from experience, of course. Well... you have a choice. I didn't. Look, Archie, I really don't want us to dwell on the past. Besides, I'm the last one to preach. [scoffs] Which is why I do it so well. [chuckles] Good night. Night. Good night, Archie. Dear Archie. [Archie] Edmund doesn't love you. [Pandora] I hate you, Archie. I hate you, I hate you. I hate you, Archie. [breathing heavily] [siren wailing] Hold it now! Hold it, will you? Now, listen. Kindly tell me what the hell is going on here. John. John. John! For Christ's sake, get out of here! Okay. What you're buying has to last you for the whole term, so you better plan carefully, all right? -Okay. -Here you go. Wow. I'll pick you up in half an hour. [kisses] [phone ringing] [Henry] Bye, Mommy. Hello, Balnaid. -[Edmund] Virginia. -[Virginia] Edmund? Look, there's a crisis out here, I have to go to New York. -Oh, when? -[Edmund] Well, now. I'm catching a shuttle flying out of Heathrow this afternoon. [sighs] But... tomorrow? You're taking Henry to Temple Hall -tomorrow. -Well, I'm, uh... I'm afraid I can't do that now. [sighs] Edmund, you promised. [Edmund] Well, I have to go New York. [sighs] It was the one thing, I said I couldn't face it, you accepted that. Yes, I know, I'm... I'm sorry. So, send someone else, you're the boss. It is because I am boss that I have to go. It's my responsibility. You have other responsibilities, Edmund, you promised. Virginia, be reasonable. Reasonable? I never wanted him to go in the first place. I will not be reasonable! [ambient music playing] You all right, dear? Everlasting Gobstoppers, please. [woman] All right. Uh, that one over there, please. [woman] Oh, yes. [Henry] Um... -and this one here, please. -[woman] Yes. -Oh, and one of those, please. -[woman] Uh-huh. [Henry] Mommy, look what I've got. Great. Honey, um, your daddy called -to talk to you. -What about? Well... he's got to go to New York... today. -Oh. -So, he won't be able to take you to school tomorrow. Um, I thought... Oh, Henry, I'll take you, okay? It's all right. I wanted this to be a good day. Damn, Edmund! Mr. Aird. You'll be late for your plane. [classical music playing] Henry, listen. It'll be okay, honest. [sighs] Honey. Please, stop doing that. We'll go home, we'll have a cup-- Hello, Virginia. How are you? -Is everything all right? -Yeah. I'm just picking Henry up. -Oh. -[Henry] I'll walk. Look, don't be silly. Come on, Henry. Come, let's go to the-- Henry, please. -Henry. -[Pandora] Henry. Do you like me to take you home? I've got music. And you could play bears with my mink coat, wouldn't that be fun? Really? That's not necessary, Pandora. Come on, Henry. Henry. Henry. [Pandora] Don't worry, Virginia. I'll bring him back, safe and sound. [birds chirping] You're on your own, then. Edmund's gone to America, I hear. Yeah. For a few days on business. It must be lonely for you. I saw Pandora. That hair looks dyed to me. And why does she ought to wear dark glasses for in this weather? I'm sorry. I really don't know what you're talking about. [Lottie] Do you, now. Well, I wouldn't have been too happy, if I were in your shoes, with Pandora back. Not if your husband's around. That's why she's here, of course, still after him. I don't have to listen to this. I was there... outside her bedroom door. It was dark, but I could hear all right. You didn't guess, did you? He's a cruel fish, Edmund, just like the rest of them. They all knew what was going on. What? They're all as thick as thieves. That's why they gave me notice. I knew too much. Ugh, you're making all this up. Why do you think he's taken himself off? Panic, I'd say. Wait till he gets back, it'll be the same story -all over again. -Look. I don't think that you should go around spreading lies -like this, okay? -I'm no lying. Ask any of them. Ask them about the baby. They didn't need to kill the baby. I'd have looked after it. I said I'll care for the baby. It could be mine, but she went rushing off to London and got rid of it. Murderers. The lot of them. [dramatic music playing] [car horn honking] [dogs barking] Sorry, we've been gone so long. Henry, I made you lunch about an hour ago. It's already 2:00. We had lunch in the car. I had a burger, a great big one, and fries, and strawberry milkshake. Are you all right, Virginia? Yeah, I'll be okay. Henry, why don't you go upstairs? Edie's waiting to say goodbye to you. Thanks for the lunch. He actually liked it. Children have no taste. Virginia? You looked like you should be on your bed. Do you need some help? No. No, thank you. -Why did you come back? -What? After all this time, why did you come back? Never could resist a party, darling. [birds chirping] Bye. [goats bleating] Just come here a wee moment, Henry. Okay. Yes, that's about right. Hmm. -I like your new cardigan. -Oh. Your mother brought it back from London. It's cashmere, lilac, I'm keeping it for best. Lilac, it's nice. Oh, bother. I need a black pen. Look at my hand bag, there's one in there for sure. Okay. [ambient music playing] Thanks. [classical music playing] [woman] Don't you worry, Mrs. Aird. -He'll be fine. -All right. Thank you. -Henry. Come back and visit me -Mommy. really soon, okay, and you will have a great time. Come along. Let's get you in out of the rain. I love you. Have a great time. -Okay? -Come on. Get the bag. [classical music playing] [man] Here you are, sir. Thank you, Robbie. Are you sure this is gonna help my golf game? [both laugh] [man] What room will I put it on, sir? [man] Oh, it's, uh, 210 or 201. -And send to the name of Tucker. -[man] Mr. Tucker, okay. Tucker? Conrad Tucker. Virginia? -Yeah. -Yeah, Robbie. -Excuse me, can I just... -Yes, yes, yes, sir. -Hi. -Hi. I don't believe-- I don't believe this. -Oh. -Wow. -Oh. -What are you doing here? Um... I was invited. Well, that-- so, let's sit down. I'd love to. Where have you been all this time? Oh, my God. What has it been, 12 years? -Wow. -You look wonderful. Oh, thank you. I remember that summer so clearly. -Oh, me too. -The sailing trips, the riding. Tequila sunrises at sunset. I think I did this a lot, too. Oh, midnight barbecues on the beach. Dancing, wild dancing in the terrace. Oh, yeah. That was another person, huh? Hmm? Can I get you a drink? -Yeah. -Robbie. -Yes, sir. -Gin and tonic. -Gin and tonic. -Gin and tonic, sir. So, what on earth are you doing in Scotland? Oh, well, I met this girl Katy Steynton in London. And she, uh, heard that I knew someone up here. So, she said, and I can't do her accent. But she said, you know, "Come to my birthday party. Everyone will be there." -So, here I am. -You're the sad American. You're the sad American. -Excuse me? -Oh, I-- I'm sorry. It's just that Isobel didn't know anything about you, except that your wife had die-- -Um, I'm sorry. -It's okay. Can I ask you about it? Of course. Her name was Elizabeth, she had leukemia. Anyway, what about you? -[sighs] -[Conrad] Do you have a husband? Yeah. He's in New York. I have a son, as well. How old is he? Eight. -His name's Henry. -Uh-hmm. And... this very day, I have thrown him into a snake pit of a boarding school. -Oh, boy. -[scoffs] It's probably the most awful day of my life. You know, that summer... when I went back to the Cape... your father told me you'd gone to England. I couldn't believe it. Yeah. I never intended to stay. Then, across a crowded room, uh, I saw Edmund. Hmm. And I'm just like the song that... that was it. Oh, God. This is just a bad day, all around. Why don't you stay here, tonight? No... [stammers] I have to take care of my dogs. [sighs] I'll go back with you. [sighs] Okay. [classical music playing] I guess Isobel wouldn't mind having you a day early. [Conrad] My gosh, magnificent. Yeah. They can't have gone to bed yet. -It's only... oh. -Well, it's... -Later than I thought. -Uh-hmm. Didn't you say there's a pub in the village? -Oh, they'd be shut by now. -Oh. Yeah. You have to stay the night at Balnaid. [Conrad] Won't that be a problem? No, no problem at all. The guestroom beds are already made up. No problem. Hello. Hello. You see why I had to come home. -Great dogs, a matching set. -[laughs] [dogs barking] [panting] [dogs barking] Hmm. -All right. -Yeah. I could live here. -[Virginia laughs] -[chuckles] Hmm. Oh, thank you, thank you. Uh-hmm. To the good old days. Cheers. Oh, it's stuffy in here. [ambient music playing] [Virginia] You have to take my word for it. The view is great. [Conrad] Uh-hmm. [Virginia] Oh, shall I close it? [Conrad] No, no. Leave it. Leave it. It's too good to waste. [ambient music playing] [Virginia] So, there's all the hot water you need. Um, I'm sorry, there's no shower. Scots like to take long baths. So, these are your reading lights, obviously. Uh, the main light is by the door and... will you be okay? Listen, I want you to know how-- I wanna thank you because I needed a friend tonight -and you were there. -Virginia, I-- You know, it's really funny because... I've been dreaming about home, you know. The breeze over the Atlantic. -Those barbecues. -That summer... did you know I was in love with you? I'm a different person. Not to me. [Virginia exhales] God, it's like a time warp. I wanna make love to you. [ambient music playing] Don't forget that the sad American is coming this morning. Doesn't anyone know his name? We'd better wake Pandora or you'll never get to Edinburgh. -Oh, morning. -Good morning. Good morning. Breakfast, Pandora. Oh, black coffee for me, darling. I've just been watching the big breakfast. It's a revelation. It's all decidedly odd. Ah. -Coffee? -Thank you, darling. You won't be long, will you? -No. -That's the local rags. There's absolutely nothing in it. Oh, that's what so wonderful, nothing changes. Don't be long, Pandora. "Fury over footpath closure." Absolute bliss. So, uh, we'll meet you at the wine bar, 1:00. -[woman] Okay. -Now then, we're gonna get you a dress for the dance and that's that. -No, no. -I just hope... She looks like she's enjoying herself. Yeah. It's what she wants us to think anyway. I ran into Conrad yesterday evening. -How do you do? -Pleasure. Yeah. Such a coincidence, We're old friends. We knew each other in the States. So, he spent the night at Balnaid. -Ah, a sensible idea. -Hmm. Would you like some coffee? -Um... -I've got to take some flower pots -up to Verena so... -I'll just, uh, -get my golf clubs. -Right. Was he okay? Henry? Not really. I have to go, Archie. Um, I'll see you tomorrow night. Yeah. Okay. -Here, let me have that. -Oh. Oh, come on, now. You're a golfer? Uh, what course... [Isobel] I have never in my life owned a dress like this. Time you do. You deserve it. And what's Archie wearing to the party? He used to look terrific in a kilt. Oh, he won't wear it anymore. He says a tin leg on view is an obscenity. -He'll wear his dinner jacket. -Oh, that's too boring. We have to find him something brilliant. Let's go. -[car horn honks] -Woo. We can't. Pandora, you can't. Someone's reserved it. Oh, we've got it. Possession is nine-tenths of the law. Look, we can have a cocktail, and they've got Quiche and salad. I hate cocktails, don't you? -And Quiche. -[woman] I'm sorry. I'm afraid this table is reserved. Really? Well, I didn't see a sign anywhere. You knew perfectly well. Look, we are dying of thirst, and Lady Balmerino here would love to order a bottle of your very best champagne. So, do you think perhaps you could organize that? Chilled? [scoffs] Pandora, you're shameless. I know, darling. Did you write the Lady Balmerino a bit? You should never underestimate the power of snobbery. [Verena] I'll never get tired... But it's what you ordered, madam. Well, can't you pull it in at the sides and-- and make it taller, is that as high as it will go? I could put it on stilts, or would you prefer a hot air balloon? There's no need to be rude. -Oh, hello dear. -Hi. [Verena] Have you ever seen such chaos? Oh, I wanted to ask you a favor. Mr. Cadwallader, I expect the canopy to be the same color as the rest of... I'll put these flower pots in the kitchen. [Verena] All right. I don't think it's demanding too much to expect the job to be done properly. [Cadwallader] I'm doing my best, madam. -[Virginia] Come on. -[dogs barking] [growling] [Virginia] What's wrong with you? Come on, you silly, things, what's wrong? [gasps] [dogs barking] What are you doing here? You have no right to walk into my house. You should lock your doors then. Please leave. I thought we'd have a wee word, a little chinwag. I don't wanna hear any more of your lies. Lies? Ouch. Why should I tell lies? The truth is good enough. You didn't like it when I called Pandora -a whore. -Oh, get out. You're no better than a whore yourself. The vileness of men and women, the filth. You are trespassing. If you don't leave right now, I am going to call the police. Why don't you? I could give them a statement. A sworn affidavit. Maybe the press would like the story. Lustful practicism on the aristocracy. Wife brings a fancy man home to share a bed with her, when her husband's away. I don't even know what you're talking about. No? Bad weather we had last night? All that rain, then it cleared up. When you looked out of that bedroom window, it was quite dry and bright. I could see the two of you as clear as anything. -Get out. -All right, I'm going. I'm going. I'll have a word with your husband -when he gets back. -Go. [classical music playing] [doorbell rings] [goats bleating] Why didn't someone tell me? You know what we're like, Virginia. All of us... we prefer discretion. Discretion? For God's sake, she was pregnant. Why? Just tell me what happened. Edmund hadn't seen her for years. He came up to Archie's wedding and... there she was. When they met, it was... like a sort of explosion. Fireworks. I suppose, we hoped it would... burn itself out. But it didn't. I never heard the full story. I do know there was a terrible row with Archie. And then, she was gone. Took the car and ran away to London. She had an abortion. I think... I think she's still in love with Edmund. Maybe he feels the same way. Maybe... Maybe, um... Maybe, I'm not enough for him. Edmund is a true Scot... keeps things... bottled up. I'm sure of one thing. He loves you. Surely, you know that. I'm not sure about anything anymore. There's something else, um... When I took Henry to Temple Hall yesterday, afterwards, I stopped at a roadside hotel and, um... I met Verena's sad American. Turns out, I know him. Knew him, years ago. -Extraordinary. -[Virginia] Yeah, well, we had dinner and... then he stayed the night at Balnaid. Then I took him to Archie's. But what-- what's the problem? Well, then... I went home and I found Lottie in-- in the kitchen, and she was raving. She said that she was in the garden last night. And she saw Conrad and I together. She was watching us through the windows. She ranted on about lust and fornication. She called me a whore and, um... And she said that... she said that she was gonna tell Edmund that... Conrad and I had been together. That we'd slept together. Oh, my dear. Edmund knows Lottie. He'll know it's all lies. I... It's true. [Archie] They feed on the heather, mostly. We burn it off in strips to encourage the new growth. The longer heather gives the birds cover. [Conrad] Do you still shoot? [Archie] No, not very often these days. Uh, I miss the walking, rather. [Conrad] Oh. -[glass shatters] -[suspenseful music playing] [Edie] She talks an awful lot of rubbish, doctor. You don't want to believe it all. She's just unhappy, poor soul. Mrs. Aird, good of you to come. What happened? Lottie had a disagreement with someone. It seems a brick was involved. Edie, my dear. It's all right. There's no real harm done. It's just... She saw Pandora in Dermots Shop. [Lottie] ...Should not close the door when someone is speaking to them. [dramatic music playing] You lost your leg in the army? Falklands War. Ridiculous quarrel over a lump of rock that nobody had ever heard of. What happened? We were patrolling on South Georgia. We were ambushed. You're lucky to be alive. Yes, more so than some of my chaps. One of them was there because of me. Ridlin Piper. He was only a lad. Won first prize at the Strathcroy Games. I gave him the cup. His mother asked me my advice about him. I said join the regiment. He was killed. [Conrad sighs] You know, many people would envy your life here, Archie. This is a great place to live. [Archie] Yes, well, it is in September anyway. Pandora would tell you that when we were young... it was blue skies and sunshine all summer, and it never rained. I fear the records would contradict her. [Violet] Everyone's coming to Verena's party. And, of course, tomorrow's my birthday picnic at the Loch. Won't be the same without you, Henry. Edie sends her love. And there's no need for you to worry about her now as Lottie has gone back to hospital. We all miss you very much. And I do hope you're settling in nicely at your new school. Lots of love, grandma. [door thudding] Let me out! Let me out! Help! Somebody help me! [suspenseful music playing] [Conrad] Bosco, Whisker, come on, come on. Come on, come on. -[Archie] Cheers. -[Conrad] Thanks. [bell ringing] [Pandora] Is one of those for me? [Archie] Yes, it is now. So strange being here. Thanks. [Archie groans] [Archie exhales] How are you, darling? -Pan? -Yes? About what happened... No, Archie. I don't want to talk about it. It's a long time ago. But I really do wanna talk about it. I-- I let you down, I lied to you... about Edmund. You see, I knew that... he wasn't happy with Caroline. And that he would've gone to the ends of the earth for you. Perhaps. But you are right. As usual, I was being selfish. Besides, an illegitimate baron in the family... who'd ever heard of such a thing. You know, you have every right to be bitter. [sighs] Don't be silly. Probably all for the best. I mean, what kind of a mother would I have made? [scoffs] Spoiled kitten like me. You know, nevertheless... If I had been more understanding... You would've kept the baby. You don't flatter yourself. If my driving had been better, I would've kept it anyway. What? When I wrapped my car around a lamppost on the motorway to London, I thought, "Goodbye, world." What I got was a broken wrist. I lost the baby. But... I thought... Pan... Did you think I had an abortion? But your letter implied. Maybe part of me wanted you to think that. I hated you then, Archie. At least I thought I did. My God. Twenty years we've lost. I thought I'd never see you again. [Pandora] Archie... you're so busy... remembering what you've lost, you... don't have the time to appreciate what you do have. Wonderful Croy... Lucilla, Isobel. Life is too short to dwell on what might have been. To the future. [dramatic music playing] What? I love you in that ridiculous hat. Do you now? I had such a day, did all the shopping. Got everything on your list. Champagne, and I bought a new dress for the dance. Pandora bought it for me. She bought you a present as well, it's on the bed. Oh, whatever can it be? [Isobel] Mr. Sinclair had your measurements. He helped us choose. What do you think? Pandora said you couldn't go in your dinner jacket. You'd look like a part-time waiter. I found your father's old smoking jacket in the attic. [Archie] Where's your dress? Oh, I've hidden it away till Friday. Pandora wouldn't let me know how much it cost. It must've been a lot of money. Do you think I should've let her be so extravagant? [Archie] Oh, she always loved giving presents. Do you like them? What else did you do today? We had lunch in the wine bar. Pandora made sure we had the best table. What'd you think? I think you look amazing. [snickers] Lady Balmerino, may I have the honor of the next waltz? [dramatic music playing] Have you anything which requires your attention urgently, hmm? Not that I can think of. No dinner to cook, no dogs to feed. Not immediately. Then why don't you come to bed? Archie. [dramatic music playing] I haven't said this lately but... no one was ever more loved... or needed. [dramatic music playing] I love you so much. Shall we? Now? Yes, there's just one problem. What? How do I get out of these bloody trousers? [laughter] Now, I've got the shirt. What do I need... Oh, jumper. Hold on. What's the problem? It's only family. Only family you said? Father still thinks of me with ankle socks and pigtails. And he and grand will be putting a laser beam over you to see if you're sound. Oh, yeah. Maybe I should take my new cords. What are those? Oh, it's just the usual. Something for the host, hostess, and your grandmother. Aren't you the thoughtful one? I suppose bachelors seem to more know -about these things, eh? -Absolutely. I'll get them all sold. Look, if we don't leave in one hour sharp, we're gonna miss that plane. Come on, move it. Oh. I'll have to dash. I will be back in time for the picnic. You're really sure you can't come to it? Quite sure. I've got to get these flowers done or Verena will be in a terrible state. What... Why are you going so early? Oh, just some business. I'll see you later. -[Virginia] Get out of there. -Hey, you're here. -Great. -[Alexa] At last. -[Virginia] Hello, Neil. -[Neil] And what's this, uh... Boy scouts going camping, are we? No, this is Vi's picnic. And you're gonna help me load it into the car. I'll take the beer. Very good. Is there anything else to go down? [Virginia] Uh, take that, that'll be great. [birds chirping] I'm dying to meet the mysterious Pandora. What's she like? She's a dazzler. But is she nice? Dazzlers don't have to be nice. [Alexa] Oh, Neil. [cheerful music playing] [dogs barking] Grand? Happy birthday, Grand. Alexa, darling. Seventy-eight, isn't it awful? Grand... this is Neil. -Hello, Neil. -[Neil] Hello. I've heard a lot about you. Well, I, uh, better give you my side of the story then, haven't I? Happy birthday, Vi. Oh. -Hi. -Come and meet everyone. [indistinct chatter] Hetty, this is Neil. It's Keating, isn't it, Neil? [man] Come on, Neil. [man] Great stance, Neil. Look at that. [indistinct chatter] [man] Wait till the next dance, all right? [laughter] [Pandora] And turn. -Neil, you're not trying. -[Neil] This is trying [indistinct] I'm sorry, I was supposed to get those, wasn't I? My fault, Alexa, I insisted. And I was just putty in her hands, wasn't I? Sorry. -[woman] Oh. -[man] What? You're gonna have to shave that beard -as soon as we're home. -[man] No way, why should I? [woman] Because I'm starting to get a rash. [man laughs] Yeah, well, uh, I'll just have to start kissing in some place that doesn't show, won't I? [dramatic music playing] [Pandora] I've dreamed of this so often. It was always here if you wanted it. Well, Archie, I never know what I want until it's too late. Right now, I wanna go back to the party. Are you coming? -No, you go. -Okay. [Conrad] Boy, that was a good one. -Hi. -Hi. [Conrad] Is everything okay? Yeah. When are you going back? Oh, I booked a flight next Thursday. I wish I was staying longer, I... You know, I really wish that you were coming with me. Hmm. I'm sorry, I shouldn't, uh... I mean, I know I'm making things difficult for you. It's just that I thought that... You know, maybe you might need to get away... for a while. Funny, I was thinking that myself. [dramatic music playing] [Violet] Tell me, Neil... what do you think of us all? Terribly establishment over privileged? [Neil] [laughs] Oh, well, I must admit, you do live in a fairly grand style. Old money, old houses, old names, it's... [Violet] My father... was the son of a crofter from the Hebrides. [Neil] Really? [Violet] He ended up being a soldier. [Neil] [laughs] [Violet] My mother was grand. Rather nice, for all that. My husband... my dear Geordie, was the son of our gatekeeper. How funny. Well, you see, the Scottish clan system means that no man is another man's servant. Just one of the family. It's a lot of pride. Mark you, he did go and qualify in Edinburgh before he asked my father's permission to marry me. -[laughs] -[Neil] Ah, well. [laughter] Well, excuse me for a bit. Oh, yes, of course, run along. I was lucky I married the man I loved. I hope the same thing can happen to Alexa. I don't know who you really are, Neil, or what you want from life. But all I ask, if you wish, that if you do have to hurt her, you do it now before it's too late. Wait a... [Violet] I hope you're fond enough of her to be able to do that. [Alexa] Oh! Lunch is ready. Come on, darling. Let's go and eat. I wonder what they've got for lunch. -[Alexa] Lots, I hope, lots. -[Violet] Lots. Edie sends her love. And there's no need for you to worry about her now. As Lottie has gone back to hospital. We all miss you very much. And I do hope you're settling in nicely at your new school. Lots of love, Grandma. [dramatic music playing] [man] It'll be set up by 9:00. The lights are where? No, I need them here at 6:00 at the latest. You'd better. Already, it looks like a bloody circus. All right, bye. [doorbell rings] Yes? I'm your mobile disco. Oh. Well, I rather think the young people will be expecting, uh, punk and heavy metal. [man] Look, lady, what they want is a light show, a DJ and loud music. Oh. Would it be very loud? Oh, very, very loud. We're talking a 5K rig here. Trust me. -5k rig? -[man] Aye. [bus engine revving] [suspenseful music playing] [indistinct chatter] Hello? Hello? Hello. you're Mr. Ed. I'm Neil, I came with Alexa. -Nice to meet you. -Dad. -Hello, darling. -Hi. How are you? -Welcome home. -And you. You're back. Did you meet Neil yet? Oh, you mean that stranger in there with his shoes off sleeping on my sofa and helping himself to my best malt? Ah, he brought that whiskey and he's got -another bottle for you. -Oh. He's an excellent guest. Oh, that's a maybe. I intend to do a little checking up on him. Same old dad. -[Virginia] How was your flight? -Hellish. Delayed take off in New York, had to run to catch the Edinburgh flight. How's Henry? I hadn't called. I thought it would be considered the wrong thing to do. Here. Thanks. [Edmund] So, uh, what else has been happening? Lottie Carstairs is back in the hospital. [Edmund] Is Edie all right? Oh, she's fine. Turns out Lottie is quite the local historian. Told me a few old stories. What stories? The big picture was you and Pandora. [suspenseful music playing] Look, Edmund. If you and Pandora had an affair, it's all before my time. But you were married with a kid. And she was left alone and pregnant. So, you don't trust me? [scoffs] I don't even think I know you. You're getting yourself all worked up. No, I'm being human, unlike you. I'm thinking of going away for a while, back to the Cape. When? In a week. With Henry away at school, there's not much reason for me to be here right now. -I see. -The way things seem to be. So you've, uh, got it all worked out? Not really. You're gonna be meeting someone tonight. The American that's staying with Isobel and Archie. Turns out, we're old friends. [bus door hisses] [bus engine revving] [suspenseful music playing] [phone ringing] -Hello? -[man] Mrs. Aird, I'm afraid we have a little problem. Ms. Carstairs has disappeared. Disappeared? How could she possibly disappear? -Hello, Edie? -[Edie] Hello? [Violet] It's Vi. Listen, my dear. I've-- I just heard from the hospital. It seems that Lottie has disappeared. -[Edie] Oh, goodness. -[Violet] Calm down, Edie. -Where could she be? -[Violet] Don't worry. I-- I've had a word with Edmund, and I think you should spend the evening up at Balnaid, just in case. [Edie] Oh, dear. I hope she isn't going to cause any trouble. [dramatic music playing] Oh, I need a slip. The dress is totally see-through. Oh, dad, you look fantastic. [dramatic music playing] Neil, Edmund, and where's Virginia? Tidying her hair. Sorry, we're late, but, um... You have met Conrad Tucker. How do you do? How do you do? [Archie] I'm sure you know that Conrad's an old friend of Virginia's. Oh, I do now. She tells me you're traveling back to the States together? And she's made up her mind. I didn't know that Virginia was planning a trip. Oh. You're not alone, Archie. This is a night of surprises. [Jeff] Edmund. Oh, Jeff. Oh, yes. Yes, that looks better on you than it ever did on me. -Yeah, it feels good. -Good. Oh, Archie, look, by the way. I thought you should know. It seems that Lottie Carstairs is on the loose. Oh. Well, she's not dangerous, surely. Well, Vi seems a bit worried, so Edie's moved into Balnaid. Vi didn't want to abandon the, um, cottage. Edmund. [Edmund] I say. [Archie] Well, if the Americans could see you now, we could charge double. -Drink, darling. -Oh, definitely champagne. [indistinct chatter] [Archie] Oh, good. Oh, good. Look, here are the girls. [woman] You all look so good. Thank you. [Archie] Hello. [indistinct chatter] [Violet] Oh, here's your champagne, Pandora. Thank you. Darling, you look absolutely divine. -Thank you. -Divine! Doesn't she? Archie, did you see her? [dramatic music playing] [woman] Yes, very funny. [dramatic music playing] [gasping] [suspenseful music playing] [indistinct chatter] [suspenseful music playing] [grunts] [siren wailing] So, my father finally sent for the young man. And said, "Donald, half a dozen young women are over an area of 20 miles, are in the family way, and naming you as the father. How do you explain this?" Donald thought for a moment, and then said, "Well, so you see, I have a bicycle." [laughter] It's Edie Findhorn. She says can she have a word with Mrs. Aird. And Mrs. Edmund, that is. She says it's urgent. [suspenseful music playing] Oh, Henry. [Edmund] Hello, Henry. [grunts] Good to see you again. Oh, you poor old soldier. Oh. Now, tell us what happened. [Henry] I thought Edie was dead. Lottie was in the kitchen wearing Edie's best lilac cardigan. And her lips were all red like blood and I thought Edie was murdered. -[Edmund] Oh. -It's all right, what happened? Then I tripped and it bled a bit. Oh. Well, I'll just let them know at Croy that all is well. And I'll give the, uh, school a call. [Virginia] Is that where it was hit? Yeah. [Virginia] Oh, you're a trooper. [indistinct chatter] Well, positions, everyone. Katy. Carry on. Oh, champagne, lovely. My dear, how wonderful to see you. Now... [indistinct chatter] Are you all right? -Yeah. [chuckles] -[chuckles] Why didn't you go to the dance? No. No, really, I'll be fine here. Edie's here to look after me. [Virginia] Are you sure? Yeah. I don't have to go back, do I? You did well. I'm proud of you. [Archie] Probably better take my arm, Vi. [indistinct chatter] -[woman] Come on, everybody. -[man] I'm all right, you? You were right, and I was wrong. Henry is not ready for boarding school. I think we should talk. Edmund, I just don't want to. No, wait, please. Please, just... Well, just listen to me, would you, please? I should have told you, well, ages ago about what happened. I, uh... I hadn't seen Pandora for years. And then at Archie's wedding, there she was. I saw her coming across the hall to me at Croy, and she... She threw her arms around me and said, "Edmund, you horrible man, you got married too. Why didn't you wait for me?" And... I felt I was... drowning. When I tried to talk reason to her, she just put her hands over her ears... shut her eyes. Oh, the same thing happened when I... When I found out that she was pregnant. She wanted me to leave Caroline and marry her. Well... Well, I... I couldn't do the right thing, there... There was no right thing, so... I ran away. Some big financial deal was in trouble in Hong Kong. So I went there. And it was while I was away that Archie had this awful row with her. He told her she was being silly, that I wasn't really in love with her. And he was right, I suppose. Anyway, by the time I got back, it was all too late. She got rid of the baby, and... we never saw each other again. You were the one who never made a mistake. It's nice to know you're not perfect. Don't leave me. [upbeat music playing] [car horn honks] [upbeat music playing] [festive music playing] Come on, Pandora. [Isobel] Come on, change your shoes. [indistinct chatter] [festive music playing] Rector and Mrs. Laxaby Very dear friends of ours. Simon, a very dear friend of my daughter, Katy. My husband, Angus. Neil and Jeff. [festive music playing] Oh, here they are. He's all right. -Fine. -Oh, thank goodness. And Lottie? Oh, it's strange. Henry was running away from her when he tripped and fell and knocked himself out. And then Lottie ran, picked him up, and carried him to Mrs. Ishak's. Apparently, she kept on saying that she just wanted to have a chat with him, uh, a wee chinwag. I've been ordered to round everyone up for the dancing. -Oh. -Good. Well, come along, mother. I am sure you can manage a reel or two. Oh, thank you, dear, I'd like to try. [festive music playing] [clapping] This is fun. Do the Brussels know this goes on? [laughter] [ominous music playing] [applause] [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] [sighs] I'm exhausted. [laughs] Me too. How's Henry? Oh, fast asleep by now, I should think. What a thing to do, running away like that. Yes, it would seem to be a local tradition. I'm not gonna talk about that, are we? Pandora, listen, listen. I quite understand your not forgiving me. Oh, forgiving? Sounds very pious. Edmund, I've hurt an awful lot of people in my life. I can't be bothered with it. Forget it. That's the answer. -I behaved like... like a... -Edmund, no. Don't blame yourself for the mess I've made in my life. I've always been a disaster waiting to happen. The baby. Please, Edmund... just let it go. Leave it. [Verena] Everyone's having a good time. Isn't it marvelous? -Marvelous. -[Edmund] Yes. [Pandora] Well done, Verena. I'm glad Virginia's made you happy. Why did you come back? Oh. A whim. -[Edmund] Hmm? -An impulse. The story of my life, to have some fun, darling. Why don't you go back to the party. -[festive music playing] -[clapping] [cheering] [mellow music playing] Neil, would you mind driving me home? -[indistinct] -That's right. Thank you. Should we go? [mellow music playing] Can we have a word about that forestation scheme of yours sometime? Now, look, Archie, I don't wanna push this. Let's just forget about it. I've been to see the people in Edinburgh. Rather like one or two of their ideas. Thought we might talk about it. I think maybe we should. Good. [Pandora] I didn't wanna break up the party. But I'm just aching for my bed. You come to any decisions? [Neil] About what? [Pandora] What do you think? [Archie laughs] Of course, I was just speechless. What? I was looking for Neil. Neil? He-- he was here a minute ago with Pandora. They'll be here. [Neil] This family stuff is a bit hard to take. [Pandora] No, it's just the herd protecting the weaker ones. [Neil] The herd? Whatever happened to civilized human beings? [Pandora] Scotland, darling. Very primal. It can be human. [Neil] We're here. [sighs] I'm going straight to bed. Good night, Neil. Good night. Whatever you decide, tell her. Don't let it drift. That's my thought for the day. Ladies, ladies and gentlemen, breakfast is served in the snooker room. [cheering] Isabel, Vi... -Oh, yeah. -Absolutely. Should we go through? [Virginia] Conrad. [mellow music playing] [indistinct chatter] You won't be on the flight on Thursday. How'd you know? Call me psychic. Edmund's face, yours, Henry's home. I'm sorry. I don't want you to think that I was using you. Listen, we were there for each other on a bad day. I'm glad it was you. Me too. Where were you? Kiss me. Present. Come on, I'll get your breakfast. I was just running Pandora home. I'm sorry. Do you like it? I got Yasmine to reserve it for me that night at the gallery. -Thank you. -Pleasure. Marvelous. For you. -No, no, my dear. -No, please, take it, I insist. I'd never be able to face you again if I didn't behaved properly. And, um, believe it or not, I do mean to be good. Are we to see more of you then? Well, I-- I don't know. I suppose that... that rather depends on Alexa. Vi wants to know if I'll be coming up again. Well, if I'm married into the family, you'll insist, won't you? I mean, there'll be, um, Christmas and Burns Night, Vi's birthday-- Neil... I'm really not sure. I mean, you and me at tribal dances on the Grassmoor, I'd rather shoot myself in the foot. [laughs] [suspenseful music playing] [gasps] Oh. [suspenseful music playing] [car engine revving] [suspenseful music playing] Go boys, out you go. Go on. [dog barking] [officer] Good morning, sir. Can we have a word please? What? No, no, no, no, no. Of course, we can't accept terms like that. Anyway, George, look, I'm gonna spend a few days here at home, yeah, with the family. So, uh, I want you to look after this. Get on the next plane to Malaysia and... Look, George, I'm gonna have to call you back, all right? [dramatic music playing] [Pandora] Darling, Archie, frightfully sorry about all this. It's just that I haven't the energy to fight any longer. Carlos, my doctor is a kind man, but he doesn't beat about the bush. He says I'm going to die. Well, aren't we all? But me rather sooner because of the cancer. It's been... truly wonderful seeing you all again at Croy. I've been very sensible and made a will, left all my worldly goods to you. It's quite a lot. I'd love it if you'd use some of the money to turn the stables into a workshop for your beautiful carvings. It's what she intended all along. She came home to die. I think she came home to see Croy again. And to spoil us, make us laugh. [dramatic music playing] [dramatic music playing]
