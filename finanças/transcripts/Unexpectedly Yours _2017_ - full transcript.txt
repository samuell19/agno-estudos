--== McEphie ==-- [upbeat music playing] [inhales deeply] -Yes! -Yes! -Happy Birthday! -Happy Birthday! -Happy Birthday, Patty! -Yes! Welcome to the fans club! -Welcome to the fans club! -Welcome to the fan club! -Selfie! Let's take a selfie. -Oh, yes! -Come on! Let's take a selfie! -Yes! [camera shutter clicking] -Got it! -Okay! -Perfect! -Hold on. What's going on? What's wrong? Patty? I am old! But... I'm still pretty. -There you go! -Of course! Age is just a number, dear! Clich√©! -I know. But it's true! -Hey! Hey! Stop it! -Patty, just open your gifts. Come on! -Good idea! This one's from me. Nice! I have a lot. But thank you! Thank you! Doc! You perverts! It's a massager. -For your aching joints! -Oh, God! So we can dance the night away during our reunion. Lulu? -Grandma! -Patty! It's so you can pick up a new hobby once you accept your early retirement package. What? At 50? No way! What am I supposed to do with this? So you'll find someone like this. -[all laughing] -Then he can be your date to our reunion. I already have a date. -Oh, God! -Oh, no. It's Yael, I'm sure. Of course! But you've been separated for ten years now, right? And one year annulled. -But he keeps coming back. -Yes! When he's in trouble. Or whenever he breaks up with his girlfriend. Wake up, girl. He's using you. You know the saying, "No matter how many twists and turns you take--" You'd still end up like Lulu. Old maid! -Hey! But I'm happy. -Exactly. I don't think it's for me. You're so mean. Then you should find yourself a new man. -What? -[Doc] Or else we'll set you up. Go and do something fun and exciting. -Hey! Wait! -No, no, no! [sighs sharply] This is not funny! Here! In case of emergency! [sighs] [playful music playing] -[patron 1] Cheers! -[patron 2] Cheers! -[woman 1] Swimming attire! -[woman 2] What's she wearing? [women laughing] -Whatever! -[woman] I think it's a two-piece. Just last year, I was the same size as you guys. [man 1] Yael! [man 2] Bro, cheers! Congratulations! Are you ready for later? [playful music playing] [sighs sharply] Seriously? They were going to set me up with Yael all along? [indistinct chatter] [laughter] [chuckles] Miss Liz Pascual, will you marry me? [man] Come on, Liz! Say yes! Yes, I will marry you. Yes! [crowd cheers] [somber music playing] Are you happy? It suits you. [quirky music playing] Jerk. [sighs] [knocks on door] [grunts] [groans] [grunts] Yuck! Gross mustache. [phone ringing] Hmm. Hello? [Doc] Hello, Patty? Tell us everything! Who's the lucky guy? [sighs] What? Wait. How many rounds did you go? -Tell me. -Nothing's happened yet. What? I thought you guys were done. -Oh, my God. -Oh, I think we're just about to start. -He's still in the shower. -Really? Are you sure he's decent? This guy you set me up with? We didn't set you up with anyone! Then who's this? He's covered in tattoos. I have no idea! You're the one who picked him up. He might be a pervert or an ex-con. There's a large dragon tattoo around his thigh. -Get out of there! -He's finished. Wait. I got to run! -Get out of there! -Hold on! Get out! Go! [gasps] Your father is a real jerk. Did he have to do it on your mom's birthday? Does she know? Probably. She still follows Dad on social media. She must really love your dad. You call that love? Yes, I guess. I hope you'll be like her if ever... You know... Don't you dare! I don't give second chances. Okay, okay, I was just joking! -[Patty] Malou! -[Malou] Ma'am? -[Patty] Malou! -Bye! [Malou] Yes? Have you prepared Mama's food? -Here they are. -Yanni, table manners. Put your feet down. And go get changed, please. Why? What's wrong with this? Mama Old won't like that. Hurry up. Mama Old hates it when we're late. Malou! Take down those banners and those balloons! Because I don't want to remember that day ever! Oh, no! I think she knows. -The houses are so beautiful. -Left? -Left? -Right! It's on the right. Here? -No! Lot four! Over there! -Lot four! It's this one! -It's gorgeous! -It's so beautiful! -My goodness! -Fancy! They're the new owners of Mr. Lim's house. I hope we'll have a hot neighbor! -[overlapping chatter] -You're such a flirt! You're bringing a car, dear? -We shouldn't waste gas. -I have to work later. Oh, are you referring to your freelance gig? That's not a job. Well, it is to me. [Patty] Well, not to me. Finish your thesis and I'll find you a real job. And didn't I tell you to wear something else? If I go up and change we're going to be late. [sighs] Don't say I didn't warn you. I don't even care. -Ma... -You're almost late. I'm sorry, Ma. What is your daughter wearing? And you! You've let go of yourself. Pretty. But huge! If you worked hard enough to keep Yael... he wouldn't have replaced you. It's a pity. You'll never find someone like him. Hey! That's enough. You need to go on a diet. Yes, Ma. Mama Old, it's her birthday. -Yes, I know. -Can't she have more? I just want my only daughter to be healthy. Thanks, Ma. I have to go. -Already? -I have an event in two hours. Sorry. [Patty] Take care. [sighs] -Patricia. -Ma? You're raising a rebel. You can't allow your daughter to go on this way. Just freelancing? I'm trying my best to get her to finish school, Ma. Well, obviously, it's not enough. Do you know that it's going to reflect badly on you as a mother... if you can't control your daughter? Yes, Ma. [boy] It's Yanniverse again! You keep following her but she doesn't even notice you. -[Jason] What? -Follow me instead. You're being delusional again! One day, she'll notice me. Why don't you just make yourself useful? Mom, just you wait! I'll make her fall for me! -Oh, really? -That's a lot of talk for a coward. There are no cowards in our family! -Uncle! -Nephew! -Cocoy! -Mom! Where's your luggage? -It's outside. -I'm sure our gifts are inside! We had no idea you were arriving today! -Right. -Why didn't you tell us? Then it wouldn't have been a surprise. -That's right. -Angie, prepare some snacks! -I'm sure Cocoy's hungry. -Oh, yes. Cocoy, do you have some cash on you? Yes, I came prepared. -Here. -That should cover it! -Hey! -Mom! Let me take that. Cocoy. I'm sorry we haven't finished cleaning this huge mansion of yours! This place is huge! I bet it cost you a fortune. I hope you saved some money for yourself. Cocoy, Leni is about to give birth soon. And Onyok and Tintin are about to enter college! -I'll take care of it. -Thank you! -Did you get me something? -Of course! Let me see. This is mine! I wanted that! Why didn't you get me a watch? Here! This is yours. -Really, Cocoy? -I bought it for you. It's brand new. I just borrowed it, bro. -Thank you! -[exclaiming] That's too much. [overlapping chatter] Don't worry, Uncle Cocoy. Once I become a seaman, I'll help you support the family. You sure about that? Of course, Uncle Coy! Our good looks were meant for the sea. [both laugh] -We'll bring these home, okay? -Sure. [overlapping chatter] -Focus on your studies! -Yes, Uncle. It's late. You shouldn't have bothered. -Thank you. -Thank you, Cocoy! -Take care! -Bye! Take care! Uncle Coy, I'm sorry we depend on you so much. Mom and I are even going to live with you. [chuckles] Don't be silly. We're family. [Cocoy] You guys will always be welcome here. No, Uncle Coy. This is your house. Wouldn't it be better if you lived here with your wife? Don't you want that? Of course, I do. One day. If this was my castle, and I were its king, I'd need a queen by my side. I just need to find her. [horn honks] Yanni! Your car! [Patty] Where are your parking manners? When will you learn? The two of us live here. Just my luck! My queen! So you've been there all this time? Excuse me? [playful music playing] What are you doing here? I live here. [Cocoy] I'm your new next-door neighbor. And if you want, I can also be your life partner. [Patty] Next-door nuisance is more like it! Mom, you know each other? -[Cocoy] Yes. -No! I don't know you. Are you sure? [Patty] Yes! But we've already slept in the same hotel room. That wasn't me! That wasn't me, Yanni. -I'm not that kind of woman! -I can't be mistaken. -I took a good look-- -You're a pervert! Uncle Coy? -Her face! -Her face. I took a good look at your beautiful face. So I can't possibly forget you. So you did sleep with him? Yeah... no! We fell asleep in the same room. But that's different! Will you please tell my daughter nothing happened between us? Nothing happened, dear! You really don't remember? I don't remember anything. I don't remember anything, either. You really are just a pervert. Yanni, can you move your car? [Cocoy] I was the one who had to stay up all night. And you're the one who left without even saying thank you. But I'm still the pervert? Excuse me. Yanni? I'm sorry about this. I don't want you to get the wrong impression. Nothing happened between me and your mother. I slept on the sofa. Kindly tell your father that. Their marriage has been annulled. Really? [chuckles] My princess! No housewarming kiss for your new neighbor? You're a pervert, too. Good night! You're unbelievable. You heard me trying to convince them I'm not some pervert, right? Why did you ask for a kiss? -Pervert! -I got carried away! I have a huge crush on her! -Really? -I follow her online. -Really? -Yes. This is perfect! We can win over both mother and daughter. [chuckles] [both] Sounds good! Good morning, Miss Beautiful. Are you going to snub me offline, too? Don't you have a concept of personal space? Why are you being so grouchy? -Are you and your boyfriend fighting? -No! So you don't have a boyfriend? It's none of your business. I can't wait to get to London. -You're going to London? -Again, personal space! You whisper really loudly! [screams] So you're really going to London? Yanni? -I talked with Ms. Castro. -Good morning, ma'am. And they have a job opening for you. And they're willing to get you even if you haven't finished your thesis. They want to meet you later at 1:00 p.m. Don't let this opportunity pass. Mom, I have a prior appointment. Don't tell me it's another freelancing gig? Enough playing around, okay? Mom, I'm not! I'm not! This is important! This is more important. This is about your future, Yanni, okay? One o'clock, Yanni. My neighbors are yelling at each other so early in the morning. Mind your own business! Yanni said the same thing to me. Really? Yes! Like mother, like daughter. Ma'am Patty! Ma'am Patty! Ma'am Patty! -"Patty"? -Your shoes! Oh, right! Thanks. She called her "Patty," right? -Take care, Ma'am Patty! -Patty. Why, Uncle Coy? Excuse me, miss! Can I ask you something? What is it? What's the name of your employer? Patricia Gonzales. I see. Thank you. Oh, wait! She's back to using Patricia Ignacio. Hmm. -Thank you. -All right. [chuckles] I knew it was her! -Uncle Coy, is she your ex? -Yes. But she doesn't know it yet. -You really are my uncle. -What? Why? Yanni and I are also a couple now. She just doesn't know it yet, either. [both chuckle] But maybe it's time they find out the truth. -Sounds good! -Sounds good! As you can see, the Authentiq reader app's downloads increased last quarter. And, uh, right now, right now, um, it's been downloaded a total number of 304,576 times. [Georgina] Yes, but in-app purchases and user engagement are still low. Only half of them are active users. And only half of them even bother to open the app at least once a week. Well, tell me something I don't already know. It's all here in my report, sir. I'm sorry. What was your point again, will you get to it? You see the app as just some marketing tool. Like a digital bookstore. Wait. Because that is the vision of the company. Right, sir? To develop for the millennial market, an app, well, a digital bookstore, from where they can buy our titles. But that's not what we want. Sorry. What else do you want? Experience! Not just any app! Because, you see, the millennials, they want to be engaged. Oh, and our app is not engaging? No. That's why we can't keep doing things the same old way. Sir, what works for our older audience, it doesn't work for the younger audience. That's why I think our recent marketing event... it was such a major flop! I mean... Whose idea was that anyway? Mine. Oh. Look, Patty. Sir? You have done so well in the last 30 years. Thank you, sir. But Georgina made very valid points. Maybe the two of you can work together. So you can make a more effective marketing plan. Hmm. Miss Fatty, here's your drink! Patty. Fatty. So you haven't told your mom yet? Not yet. But don't worry, okay? I will. [Kurt] You've been saying that for months. Yes, but... I'm just waiting for the right time. You know it isn't easy. -You know my mom. -There. Besides, what do you want me to say? "Mom, I have a boyfriend and... I'm going to London!" Is that it? I know it's not easy, but... waiting here and not knowing if you'll actually go isn't easy, either. Just tell your mom... Yanni, why didn't you show up for the interview? Who's this? Kurt. Your boyfriend? Yes. Where's he from? London. And how did you meet him? Online. So you don't even know if he has bad breath or rough palms, but he's your boyfriend already. That's not a relationship. What we have is real. Yanni, it's only real when you're talking with him and holding his hand. And not just through the screen like this! He could be saying "I love you" while holding someone else's hand. Kurt isn't like that. You don't know that! [knocks on door] Good evening! What is it? Braised pork! I don't eat pork. Tough luck, Uncle Coy. Anyone, anything? No luck. Fully booked. No one's answering. Lulu, where's that friend of yours you said is going to help us? -He's on his way. -Okay. You see, Rachel, if only you had done this earlier. Patty, I've been really busy, and nobody's picking up. I've also been very busy! But you know, I always get things done! Miss Perfect. Well, I have to be! Because I can't rely on anybody else! Pause, menopausal women! If we really can't get what you want, then maybe we can go for-- What? The other option? Second best? Is that what you mean? What will people say? The other batches booked five-star hotels? Hold on. He's here. -I'll just meet him! -Okay. Doc, how's the program coming along? Patty, don't worry. Everything is set. Just worry about your speech since you're the most outstanding alumna. Guys, he's here! Oh, that's good! [Rachel] You're heaven-sent! What are you doing here? You know him? Uh, this is Francisco... -Manlangit. -Manlangit! -Francisco Manlangit! -He knows someone -who owns an event place! -Cocoy. -That's good! -You're heaven-sent! -Cocoy. -[Lulu] He's our batchmate -from Section Six. -Hello, Cocoy. I have a fantastic idea! Why don't you join our dance number? -No! -Right. -What? -Why? Patty. -We need more guys, remember? -Yes! [playful music playing] What? He's your next-door neighbor with the mustache! -What? -Right. The man with the dragon tattoo! You were checking me out? What? How dare you! We don't need your help. I'll take care of everything, okay? I doubt he can find us a nice venue. I guess the valedictorian can handle it. I better get going. -Cocoy, wait! -We had an agreement! -She doesn't want my help! -No. Just wait. Please? -No! -Wait! Patty, none of your contacts were able to help you, right? [Cherie] And we've run out of options. Please say yes. All right. Fine. -Yes! -Pick a date and time. I'll check my calendar. Excuse me. I'm doing you a favor, remember? Cocoy, I'm sorry. Menopause. And she hasn't been with a man in a long time. -Hey! -No! She just needs someone to make her smile again. Yes. [light music playing] [Patty] Yanni, you're always on the computer. You're wasting your time on that so-called boyfriend of yours. You should use your time to finish your thesis instead. Why are you so quick to judge me? [Patty] Malou, didn't I say dinner should be ready¬†at 7:00? [knocks on door] -Good evening. -Good evening, my Yanniverse. "My"? What now? Adobo. -Didn't I say-- -Hold on. Braised string beans. Braised beef. Braised fish. Braised chicken. Braised squid. No pork! I'm on a diet. What? Since when? Starting tonight. How about you, my Yanniverse? Do you want some adobo? I don't want to get fat. There's nothing wrong with gaining weight if you'll end up looking as pretty as your mom. [light music playing] You know, it's late and we're about to sleep. Don't forget our appointment tomorrow. Fine! You have a date? How did you do that, Uncle Coy? Experience. We can't have a "one strategy fits all" approach. Millennials cannot be clumped together in just one category. Do you need a bigger fan? -[Georgina] We need to determine... -No need. I'm good. [Georgina] ...so we can develop a more customized strategy for each. Uh, we're already doing that. Yeah. But everything starts and ends with just one person. [scoffs] Well, that would be me, because I'm Chief Marketing Officer. That's my job. I understand. What I'm suggesting is, what if we... decentralize? Carlos and Joana... they should be more empowered so that they can figure out the best marketing strategy for Good Food and Bella. You know, with their more customized strats, my experience, and Digital Media team, we can all align -our programs with-- -Hold on. Basically, what you're suggesting is... you do it all on your own? Uh, no, that's not what I'm saying. [Patty] Yes! Because where am I in all this? Well, the teams, they can consult you on-- "Consult"? "Consult"? I am not just a consultant here! Again, I am the CMO! Ugh. [motor engine revving] [yelping] Please, Cocoy! I'm not in the mood to argue with you right now. I've had a long day, okay? And it'll get worse if we don't leave soon. We'll get caught in traffic. Come on! Where are we going? You forgot? That's a symptom of menopause. -Me? -Mmm-hmm! -Forget? -Uh-huh. -Never! -Hmm? You give up? Venue! Lucky guess. Menopausal? Let's go. We'll be late. Get on my bike. -I'll follow in my car. -Your car? It's rush hour. We'll be stuck in traffic for hours. Let's go. Is it safe? -Yes, very safe. -I might fall. -You won't fall. I'll catch you. -Lame. Come on. Leave your things. Get on. Sure. Grab on to something hard. Here? The other one. Here? Lower. Here! Pervert. [happy music playing] It's nice. Now you believe me? I hope it's still available. [chuckles] -Excuse me. -Sorry. We're fully booked for the year. -Sure? -Yes. See? I told you. I did my research. You wasted my time. Let's go. My darling Cocoy! What can I do for you? [speaking Spanish] -[Cocoy] I'm fine! -[laughing] Uh, this is Patty. She's organizing our high school reunion. Patty, meet Mrs. Buenaventura. The "Elena" of Sitio Elena. -Hi! -Hi. So what is it? Um, we need this venue for the last Saturday of the month. Oh, consider it booked. Madam, what should we do? We already have so many pencil bookings. So give me a pen. [both chuckle] Thank you. You are heaven-sent. You know, Cocoy, I would do anything for you. [imitates gagging] Is there a problem? [coughing] Pollution. -Oh. -[laughing] Thank you. Thank you so much. You're welcome. You should buy me noodles. It can be your way of thanking me. Ah, did you buy Mrs. Buenaventura noodles? Is that why she gave you what you wanted? What? "Cocoy, I would do anything for you!" [imitates giggling and kissing] Here. Stop playing innocent. I knew it. I know the moves of people like you! Don't you have a conscience? You're ruining that woman's family. My God! Don't decent men exist anymore? If you don't stop, I'll leave you here. Then go! Wow! Who are you scaring? I didn't even want to ride your bike. For sure you've taken Elena for a ride on that thing. Elena! [mock giggle] Here! It's so flimsy! It's probably fake. [sighs] Oh, my God! Good thing we didn't get into an accident earlier. I might have died because of that thing. Uh, how much does it cost? I'll just replace it. Sorry. I only spend money on motorcycles. I bought the helmet you destroyed... using my first paycheck. Your money can't replace this. Mrs. Buenaventura is more than willing to do me favors because I saved her child from drowning at sea. You know, you think so little of me. [somber music playing] If you don't want to ride on my bike, you can stay there. [engine starts] [Jason] "I don't dream of success, I work hard to have nothing less." Unattainable! Even back then, I couldn't measure up to her. But now, Uncle Coy, you're equals. Really? -Yes! -He's right, Cocoy! She has a house. You have a house. She has money. You have money. And you're a good person. You're actually better than her. You're the one who's entitled to think highly of yourself. That's right! [exclaims] I'm over her. That's right! She doesn't deserve my attention. That's right! I thought she's changed. Who does she think she is? Well, when we see each other again, I'll show her no one can look down on the Manlangits! -There you go! -That's right! She'll see! This is the new Cocoy. [Patty] Cocoy? [knocks on door] My Patty? Uncle! You're mad, remember? But she's probably here to apologize. You should play hard-to-get. That's right. [clears throat] [Patty] Cocoy? Uncle Coy! Wait for a third time. She might leave. She's menopausal. She might get impatient. You'll know she's serious if she knocks for a third time. Oh... [Patty] Cocoy? There you go! Uncle, wait! What is it now? Try to look cold. There. Game! -[sighs sharply] -Sorry. Doesn't sound like it. [inhales deeply] Why? What should it sound like? Like you mean it. I'm trying to apologize. Why are you being nitpicky? What's with the attitude? You're trying to apologize, remember? [sighs] Fine. I'm sorry. I'll think about it. I've thought about it. I'll forgive you if we can have... coffee. So have you forgiven me yet? It depends. What are you apologizing for? Why? How many times have I offended you? Many times. Seriously? Many times? How so? At the hotel. You ran out on me after I took care of you. You didn't even say "thank you." Fine. Sorry, Cocoy, for what happened at the hotel. And thank you for looking after me. What else? When I made you those braised dishes. I put in a lot of effort to make those dishes. You didn't even try it. -I didn't ask you to do that. -Hey. [sighs] Thank you, Cocoy, for cooking all those braised dishes. And sorry. Anything else? The venue. -Right. -Mmm. Thank you, Cocoy, for helping me out. And sorry for all the mean things I said. And for breaking your helmet. That day... I just had a really bad day at work. I can feel they don't need me there anymore. I'm slowly being replaced. And the thing is, my husband just replaced me. [chuckles] He's a jerk. It's been 35 years... but you're still the only woman for me. What? I've had a crush on you since high school. -Seriously? -It's true. But you'd always ignore me. -Me? -Yes. I approached you during graduation. But you ignored me. I'm sure you don't remember. But I'll never forget that. I was humiliated. At prom... -Prom? -Yes. I asked you to dance. You said your feet hurt, but you'd get back to me. It's been 35 years. You still haven't gotten back to me. [laughs] And now you're laughing at me. [stifling laughter] Sorry. -Sorry. -It's okay. It's all in the past. You're forgiven. Chicken liver and gizzard. What? My favorite braised dish. Chicken liver and gizzard. [phone chiming] HAVE YOU EATEN YET? [Ferdie] They already asked me to file my papers. -[man 1] Just wait for us! -[man 2] Yes! Hey, there's Cocoy! -Cocoy! Man! -Coy! -How was it? -How did your medical test go? -I passed. -Nice! -You're really something else, Coy! -You can board again! You're as tough as a boulder. Yes, you can come on board the ship again! -Yes! -All right! -Man? -Yes? Looks like we'll be one crew member short next time. Yes. Too bad! Just when we found a company that pays better. -Coy! -What? -I last saw that smile on Boyet. -Really? When he got married, he mounted something else! -Cocoy? Get married? -Yes! He's long been married to his own mother! He's married to even his nephews, nieces, and grandkids. -[chuckles] -I've found the one! Really? I've loved this woman for the longest time. [man] Wow! I thought we'd never see each other again. Now that I have another shot with her, I won't let her slip away again! Our friend Cocoy is in love! Yes, he is! [light music playing] You're lucky someone talks to you. That's why you're blooming! Because someone notices you. Did you know I've been following her for four years now? When I first started following her, I think she only had 500 followers. I wonder how many she has now? Uh... Three thousand, two hundred and forty-seven. Hey! I didn't see you there. [Jason] Excuse me. I'll just talk to her. Oh. Jason. Before, I was just one of your followers and admirers. But now I'm also your friendly and extremely handsome neighbor! I might even become your forever, too! I didn't realize people like you still existed. What? People who like to make noise both online... and offline. -Let's clear this space! -Where's Phillip? -Cut him some slack! -Is Phillip here, Lulu? -He's doing this for free anyway! -Oh, my God! Late again! You can't count on people from Section Six. Oh, speaking of Section Six! Hi! [Lulu] They came together? [all clearing throats] What? You came here together? We're neighbors. What's with the couple shirt? -It was purely coincidental. -But you look sweet. -We're just friends. -For now. [shrieking] Oh, my God! It's like we're back in high school. -Are you together? Tell the truth. -What? No. -Nothing's going on. -Nothing? No labels? They're like millennials! Speaking of millennials, maybe you know someone willing to join our FGD. -FGD? -Yes. FGD. Forever good-looking daddy? [laughs] Focus group discussion! -Changing the topic! -No! I need to get an edge over that Georgina. What about Yanni? That's right. She's busy with her freelance gigs. What about Jason? He has a lot of friends. That could work. Cocoy to the rescue. -Again! -Again! [laughter] I think he's here. [instructor] Hi, guys! I'm very sorry. Finally! You're here! I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry. -Can we start now? -Oh, God! Well, what are you waiting for? Pair up! Don't pretend to be demure virgins. You're not kids anymore! -Let's do this! -Seriously? -You're so snarky! -Excuse me. Cocoy? -Is that you? -Yes, best friend! -Cocoy! -You're a different person now! I know. -[all laughing] -Let's be partners! -No! -He's taken! Cocoy already has a partner! -Cocoy? -No! -Come here. -Cocoy? [indistinct chatter] [instructor] Girls, let's start! Right! Left! Right, and boys... And right, left... Right and together. Right. Left. Right and stop! Finally. -After 35 years. -[chuckles] [instructor] Okay! Hold your partners. Now, ready, and... Cocoy? -Cocoy? -Cocoy? -What's going on? -Does he have epilepsy? Cocoy? I'm just excited. -[all exclaiming] -You're so dramatic. [instructor] Seriously? [instructor] And left, right... And one, two, three, four, left, right... Patty? -Yes? -[instructor continues] -Do you want to go out? -[instructor continues] We're already out. But we're still indoors. But it's outside the house. I'm serious. So am I. -[instructor] Hold your partner. -I won't stop pursuing you. Then don't! Really? Yes. Hey! Not yet! Coy! -Not yet! -[instructor] Cocoy! That's the finale. -Don't get too excited. -Take it easy. I'm waiting. Cocoy, I might fall! That's exactly what I want. I want you to fall... for me. Cocoy, stop it! Come on! You're sexy, but my arms are getting tired. Okay! All right! Yes! -Yes? -Yes! -You'll go out with me? -Yes! [inhales sharply and exhales] You're crazy. For you. [chuckles] You look beautiful! Thank you! Let's go! We don't want to get caught in traffic. -That's right. -Yes. Will this be exciting? Yes, ma'am! It better be. -Wait. -Let's go, ma'am. -Okay. -You ready? Yes. Hold on to something hard, ma'am! -You're just like your uncle! -[both laughing] [comical music playing] [Jason] We're here, ma'am. -You sure? -Yes. You can get down now. [grunts] [Jason] Go ahead, ma'am. Thank you. Where is he? Coming! [soft guitar melody playing] [mouthing] Wow! [mouthing] ‚ô™ I'm addicted to you ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Like a song stuck in my head ‚ô™ ‚ô™ They're fed up ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Of my endless stories ‚ô™ ‚ô™ All about you ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And the joy ‚ô™ ‚ô™ You bring ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Into my life ‚ô™ ‚ô™ That's why you're all I ever think about ‚ô™ ‚ô™ From day until night In every passing moment ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I keep longing for you ‚ô™ -‚ô™ I keep longing for you ‚ô™ -Hey! We're supposed to be serenading her. You need to take it easy. Sorry, Uncle Coy! I'll just give you guys some privacy! Sorry! [Patty] Thank you! Sorry about that. I don't know how to sing. I don't know how to play the guitar, either. But I do know how to love. Your favorite... Braised pork! -What? Didn't I tell you-- -This is for me. Here's yours. Liver and gizzard. Wow! Well done. And white rice. Why do you have more? You said you're on a diet, remember? Oh, yes. [giggling] Thank you. [Jason] Miss Sexy! Is Yanni still awake? She's upstairs. Upstairs? [playing soft melody] ‚ô™ From day to night In every passing moment ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I keep longing for you ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I keep longing for you ‚ô™ ‚ô™ In my thoughts and in my dreams ‚ô™ ‚ô™ With every twist of fate ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I keep longing for you ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I keep longing for you ‚ô™ You really don't plan on giving up? No. Remember the holy commandment? "Love your neighbor." [burps] -Sorry! -[burps] It's a tie. [giggles] Amazing! Hey, thanks for this. It really makes my heart full. Let's fill it up until it becomes obese. Me? No, your heart! But seriously, Coy. Thank you. I'm not used to this kind of treatment. Wasn't your ex affectionate? Not like this. Not even when he was courting you? Yael didn't court me. It was my mother who courted him. She thought Yael would be perfect for me. You know, handsome, smart, wealthy. You were with someone you didn't love? What a-- I loved him. -Really? -I loved him. I loved him! -Really? -I mean, I married the guy. And I stood by him even after he cheated on me. And I continued to even after he cheated on me again... and again... -Are you an idiot? -Hey. Why did you let him do that? Because I'm a mother. I wanted to give Yanni what I had growing up. "A complete family." And I did it for myself as well. I didn't want to fail. So I made sure that I did everything to make my marriage and my life "perfect." So no matter how much he hurt me, I wasn't going to quit. But you left him. No, I didn't. He left me. That's good. He doesn't deserve someone like you. Someone fat? Sexy. I'm old. So am I. Don't you want someone younger? They don't have life experience. I have a kid. I'm separated. What's important is you're unattached. I'm attached to my job. Which is why Jason and I will help you. Let's just drink. Okay. Don't worry about that. You're happy now. Thank you. You want me to sing again? [chuckling] Yes, please.] ‚ô™ Addicted to you ‚ô™ [Patty] Thank you again for agreeing to meet with us. Your participation will help Authentiq get to know your generation and know how to reach you. Okay. Let's start. You want everything fast. You want it now. Why does it seem like you're always in a hurry? That's not true. It's not our fault we have access to almost everything now. Access to information. [woman] Access to opportunities. Access to the lives of others and the life we want. -#YOLO! -YOLO! -[all] YOLO. -You only live once. What makes a product or service appealing to you? Something authentic. Engaging. And trending. If my friends are into it, I'm good with it. So you would rather listen to your friends and to social media influencers who are actually strangers? What about us parents? Their opinions are valuable. But we can make decisions for ourselves. It seems to me that you always want things to be on your own terms. Am I right? Yeah. Because our parents always followed rules and conventions. I agree. But they don't work. Even their own frustrations and disappointments... -They pass on to us! -Right! And we're adults. We're capable of living differently. So you think different is always better? -Yes. -Of course! Ma'am. Thank you. You might find rules boring. But... there is sense in finding order. In creating laws, and in making boundaries. After all, your parents wouldn't have been able to raise you well if they didn't listen to your grandparents, right? Different and new don't always mean better, kids. Remember. Okay? Agree! See? He's a millennial. Agree. [tranquil music playing] [Jason] Uncle Coy. Hi! How did it go? It went well. Your nephew was a big help. I got a lot of insights from his friends. And because of that, I'm going to feed you guys. Come inside. [both] No pork! Malou! -Yes, ma'am? -Kindly prepare some snacks. -Come on in! -Okay, ma'am. Come inside. What can we serve them? [Malou] This. Okay, good. Serve that. Hey! What? Of course! Come in! [both exclaiming] -[both] Nice! -[Patty laughing] [Patty] Have a seat. Malou, what else can we serve them? [Malou] We have lots of food. Hello. Hi, Yanni! She's so beautiful. [Patty] Malou, I forgot my things in the car. -Can you get them? -[Malou] Okay, ma'am. I'll do it. -[Patty] What? -I'll do it. -You sure? -Yes. Okay. Thank you. [car alarm beeps] Dude... [grunts] ...kindly take this inside. What's the matter? [Patty] Yael! -Hi, Pat. -Hey. -Hi! -Hmm. Your favorite. -Apples. -Thank you. Your driver's spacing out. He's not my driver. This is Cocoy. My batchmate. Our schoolmate. He's your batchmate? Yes. I never noticed you before. And he's my neighbor. -You're neighbors? -Yes. What a helpful neighbor. -Come on in. Let's go. -Wow! Come on. -Where's Yanni? -Inside. -Come on. -Okay. Cocoy, come in. Yanni? [Yanni] Dad. Hi, baby. -Coy, kindly put it down there. -[Yael] How are you? Thank you. Who's this? Is he your neighbor, too? Yes, sir. Yanni, kindly bring this to the kitchen. What are you doing here? We need to talk. Family matter. Patty... rain check? Cocoy, Jason. I'm sorry. -I had no idea-- -It's fine. If you need any help, I'm just next door. -Just call me. -Thank you. Your ex is an ass. What? I meant awesome. Nice save, Uncle Coy. [Patty] And you agreed to this? [Yael] It's what she wants to do. You believe she's going to London for that art workshop? Don't play dumb, Yael! She's leaving for that boyfriend of hers! And she asked for your permission because she knew you would allow her! As for you... How could you use your father to back up your foolishness? This isn't foolishness, Mom. It's my life. Listen to your daughter, Patty. No matter what either of you say, my answer's no! My God, Yanni. You barely know this Kurt! That's why I'm going there. To get to know him. Then why doesn't he come here instead? Are you crazy? -Why should you be the one to move? -Because I got accepted into the art workshop, Mom! -I don't want to waste this opportunity! -A waste? You know what's a complete waste? The money we spent sending you to school! You haven't even finished your thesis! You couldn't even commit to that. Why should I believe that you can finish this art workshop? Because this is something that I actually want to do, Mom. Not something that you're forcing me to do just because you think you know better. Oh, so you think you know better? You think you can make it on your own? I am definitely not paying for this workshop! Don't you dare support her foolishness! I've already paid for it, Mom. I used my earnings from the freelance gigs you keep belittling. What about your living expenses? I'll work at the pub of Kurt's family. His parents allowed me to live with them, so I can save money. My God, Yanni! You'll be depending on people you don't even know! What if they turn out to be horrible people? What if they're not? You're so judgmental. Why can't you just trust me to make my own decisions? Because you are a kid! I'm 21, Mom. I'm an adult. Then act like one! Plan out your life properly. The way you planned yours? Look how that turned out. Yanni... please just do as I say. And follow your plans? No! They are all for your own good. So you won't get hurt. So you won't make mistakes. Or so they won't say that you failed as a mother if I mess up? Not everything is about you, Mom. If I mess up, then I'm going to mess up! You have to let me make my own mistakes. You made yours. Dad made his. That's why we turned out this way. Yanni, that's enough. I am your mother. You will do as I say. Oh... you want me to be like you? I will never be like you. [somber music playing] You are not going to London. While you live with me, you will do as I say. My house, my rules! Fine. Then I'm staying with Dad. Uncle Coy... Yanni's leaving. What should we do? Mmm... that's a family matter. Stay out of it. Patty will be sharing with us what she envisions will be our marketing strategy for the next five years. I would like each one of you to feel free to make comments and insights. We are a team! Aren't we? Patty? Ms. Fatty? Well... Well... They say that publishing... print is a sunset industry. That it's dying... if not already dead. They say that companies such as Authentiq have lost their edge. That big brands like ours don't matter. Kids nowadays have put their trust in... micro-influencers and in each other... but not in us. They don't trust us. They don't like us. Because they feel like we failed them. That's why they keep leaving us. They don't want to be with us. They don't see, or... they've forgotten all the good things we've done for them. It's like you haven't done anything right. I had a plan. But it just all feels so pointless now. Because that plan has gone to shit. And I feel like shit! [softly] Shit. I'm sorry. Menopause. I think it's best for you to take the early retirement option of the company. I believe this will be the best thing for the future of the company and for you as well. I'll have HR discuss it with you tomorrow. It can wait a bit. Now you go home and take a rest, okay? I'm sorry. [somber music playing] -[woman] I wonder what happened to Patty? -[instructor] As if she knows the steps. -[woman] Okay, bye! -[instructor] I'll go ahead. -Bye, Phillip. -Cocoy? Has she answered your messages? She hasn't. Where has that woman gone off to? Let's go. -Let us know when Patty replies. -We'll go ahead. Let us know. Okay, take care. -Bye! -Bye, Doc! [Patty gasps] [sniffling] [Cocoy] Have you been here all this time? Patty? What's wrong? Come here. What happened? [sobbing] There, there. What happened? I'm such a failure! Failure? You? How can you call yourself a failure when you're the "Best Alumna" awardee? I don't deserve that award. What? Look at me. Deserted by my husband. Deserted by my daughter. Rejected at the workplace. Everyone and everything that mattered to me... that I love... they're all gone! I have nothing. I have no one. That's not true! You have someone. Me. I may not be who you expected to come along, but I won't desert you. I won't reject you. Not a chance. Okay? Thank you. And don't say you have nothing. You've gone so far in life and accomplished so much. Instead of thinking about what's missing, think of what you have. Fat. [both laugh] Brains and guts! That's why you should never say you're a failure. You're not! Especially as a mother. Yanni is so lucky to have you. But not for her. That's why she's leaving. Patty. Your daughter has the courage to leave and make a life of her own because you raised her well. She's brave. She's gutsy. Smart. Principled. All because of you. There's only one thing left for you to do. What's that? Let go. Let go of your past with Yael... with your work... with Yanni. Live in the moment. But it's scary. I'm not used to not having a plan. Patty. We could've met again so many times before. But I came into your life at this moment... to teach you just that. [sobs] Patty. Let go of everything... and hold on to me. [light music playing] I've thought about it. You can go to London. Really? On one condition. I knew it. I bet it will be impossible for me to do... so I'll end up stuck here. No. It'll be easy. Just come home. I miss you. [light music playing] [Yanni crying] Thank you. Yanni! Hi! So you'll stay? For good? You're still leaving? [breathes deeply] [playful music playing] [voice breaking] You know... [Cocoy] Yanni! Yanni! Take care! Thank you. [Jason] Yanni! [light music playing] Sorry about what happened. A tear fell. You're not deactivating your account, right? Why? Because how else can I follow you? Yanni, you sure you still want to leave? Mom... Let's go. We don't want to be late. [sighs exaggeratedly] Why... "A tear fell" might happen again. I'll go now. Take care! [assistant sobbing] Ma'am Fa... Patty, I will really miss you. Yes! I did it! [Patty] Just when I was leaving. I'll miss you, too! [light music playing] Thank you for all your years of service, Patty. Thank you, sir. Thank you. [somber music playing] [crickets chirping] Hey! Why are you still up? It's your first night on your own. So I'll sleep with you. Excuse me? No way! What are you thinking? Not on your bed. I'll just stay with you as you sleep. I won't sleep until you fall asleep. Are you sure? I have insomnia. -I'm sure. -[chuckles] -Really? -Of course! Sorry, I'm having trouble falling asleep. It's okay. I understand. It's your first time being away from your daughter. It's your first time to be jobless. Maybe you're looking for something to do. You feel useless... bored and lonely. And you're going through menopause, too. -You'll really need a distraction. -You're right. Why not go on vacation? You haven't done that, right? Seize it! There are many places you can visit... many things you can do... and much time for all of that. Right? Patty? -[Patty snoring] -[chuckles] Good night. [uplifting music playing] Malou. Yes? Join me for breakfast. -I don't want to be alone. -Oh, okay. Ma'am, it looks like I won't need to join you after all. -[Malou exclaiming] -Good morning! Where do you want? There or here? One egg. -Tomatoes? -Not too much. Tomatoes. -Okay. -Mmm-hmm... with rice. Just a bit. [Cocoy] Seaman's rice. Lulu gave this to me for my birthday. Why is this so hard? Ugh! Relax. It's just cross-stitch. But I can't put it in! -Let me. -I almost have it. I'm good at that. The trick is... to lick... before you put it in. Is that it? You're forcing me to use this. [grunts] Oh, that's it? -My secret weapon! -So you have one, too. This will put you in a good mood. Definitely not feeling it! Just you wait. Happy hormones coming! -Go, Patty, push! -I can't... -Push yourself! -I can't do it anymore! -Come on! Run! -What am I doing? -That's her. -That's her? Cocoy! Son! Mom! Mom! Mom, this is Patty. -She's my classmate. -Good morning! She lives next door. We're just going for a jog. Don't stop. Let's go. One more. Come on! Is he courting her? I think so. [instructor] Okay, let's start. Find your places. [woman] Cocoy said we're transferring to the new wing of the venue. -[group exclaiming] -Smile! What's wrong? Yanni hasn't texted or called in a while. You've let her go this far, might as well trust her completely. So we can seize... this moment! [instructor] Okay! Five, six, seven, eight, and one, two... Excuse me. You're too close. -Keep it round. -It's him! Keep it round! Whoo-hoo. Whoo-hoo. We need distance. No way. [both laughing] Look at the time! We need to call it a night. Hey! Good night! Already? Mmm-hmm. Patty. Yes? I'm tired of just talking on the phone. Can I see you? How about this? But... it would be better in person. [sighs] You're right. [romantic music playing] [sighs] You're still so far. I agree. [gasps] It's still not enough. Yes. [romantic music playing] [Malou] Ma'am! [quirky music playing] -Oops! Wait. -[exhales slowly] Wait. [romantic music playing] [giggles] -[phone chimes] -[gasps] -Wait. -Are you getting that? It's Cherie. It might be important. But you're more important! Just give me a second. Uh... Wait. [laughs] Sorry. [quirky music playing] Okay. Okay. Where were we? [both laughing] [phone ringing] Are you going to answer that? It's my mother. -This will be quick. -Okay. Mom? Son, where are you? -Uh, I'm just here in the bathroom. -What's taking you so long? I have an upset stomach. Okay. Be quick! Okay. Yes, Mom. Bye! -Distractions. -Yes. -Let's turn these off. -Good idea. You do it. -There. -Put it there. Where were we? Oh, here... -We're through with that. -[yelps] [laughs] It hurts! What happened? What is it? [winces] My neck! Here! -Your neck? -Yes! -What happened? Sorry! It hurts. -Really? -Yes. Okay, let me lift you up. -Okay. Wait! -It hurts! -One, two, three... -Ahh! -Wait. -It hurts! -It hurts! -[grunts] -[exhales sharply] -It hurts! [quirky music playing] Sorry. [soft melody playing] Will you be mine? -[laughs] -Hey, I'm serious. What do you say? You're my girlfriend now? Yes. I want to hear it. -Cocoy. -Yes? Yes, I'm your girlfriend. [exclaiming] You got excited? -[exclaiming] -[Patty laughing] [exhales sharply] At last! Patricia Ignacio from Section One is now my girlfriend! [laughs] My Patty... I love you. I love you, too. [loud knocking on door] [Malou] Ma'am! Ma'am! Yes? Your mother is downstairs. What? Oh, God. What? She said she's been calling you since last night. Oh, my God. [gasps] Cocoy, I'll go alone. Stay here. My mom doesn't know about us yet. Let me talk to her first. Your parents are strict? Yes, very. Stay there. Ma, what's the matter? "What's the matter?" What have you been up to? Why haven't you answered my or Yanni's calls? -Yanni was calling? -Yes! Her boyfriend from London cheated on her. Apparently, this guy has been on and off with his ex-girlfriend. [Mama Old] Although he said he had broken up with her for good. But he got her pregnant before then. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! "Oh, my God"? That's all you can say? Yanni is arriving at 8:40 p.m. You better pick her up. Yael has arranged everything. My God! Patricia, what are you doing? You are so disappointing! This is so disappointing! [somber music playing] [crying] I think it would be good for her if we can spend more time together. Just until she recovers. [phone chimes] Can't that wait? Our daughter should be our priority. We need to make it up to her. I know. I know. I've been thinking... I might stay here for now. What about your fianc√©e? She broke up with me. Cold feet. Lovers come and go, but family is forever. You and Yanni... you are my family. [somber music playing] [sighs deeply] To set the mood. She hasn't replied to me, either. But cheer up! Maybe tomorrow. [chuckles] [both sighing] [Mama Old] Where are the hot buns? Still on the way. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were coming. Well, I'm glad I did. It's really nice to see the three of you together again. If only... it could be like this every day. It's still possible, Mom. How sweet, Yael. Your husband is so thoughtful. Ex-husband, Mama Old. Ex ex-husband. Ma! Why not? Can't a mother hope? I'd really be happy if my daughter can have this again. Sir Cocoy! Looking for Ma'am Patty? She's inside having breakfast. Come in! No, just... Come in! -Here's the bread you wanted, ma'am! -Good -I'll just transfer these to a plate. -Okay. Good morning. And who are you? He's my batchmate, Ma. [Cocoy] I'm the neighbor-- He is your friend? Ma, this is Cocoy. Well... I'm Patty's boyfriend, ma'am. Since when? Mama Old, that's not your concern anymore. -She is my concern! She's my daughter! -Ma-- So this is why you neglected your daughter! You're wasting your time with this man! -Mama-- -Instead of fixing your marriage and putting your life back on track again, you're making it worse! Please, Mama. Stop it. Coy, let's talk later, okay? Come, let's talk later, okay? -Let's talk-- -What will we talk about? How you can't introduce me to your family? Coy, please. Not now. Don't add to my problems. I'm adding to your problems? You consider me a problem now? That's not what I said! But, Coy... Coy, I can't do this right now. Okay? Coy. Just leave. What's your problem? Yael! You can't make me leave. This isn't your house. Coy... -Are you deaf or something? -Hey... My wife asked you to leave! -Stop it, Yael! -Dad... She's no longer your wife. Well, she most certainly isn't your wife either-- -[Patty exclaims] -[Yanni] Dad! -[Yael] You bastard! -That's enough! Stop it! -Just go, Coy! Leave! -[Mama Old] How dare you? -Go! Now! -Get rid of that man! Now! Don't you dare follow that man! Come here and tend to your husband! Don't follow that hoodlum-- Stop! Shut up! Cocoy, let's talk! Please! Cocoy! Cocoy, please! -Cocoy! -You ignored me all night, but you let your husband sleep over? -Cocoy, that doesn't mean anything! -Yes, it does! No, it doesn't, Cocoy! It really doesn't! What am I to you? What are we? Coy! Why can't you say it? Because your husband is there? He's my ex! Exactly! That's why I don't understand what the problem is! My mother is here. So what? It... it's just not a good time. When is it not a good time to tell the truth? You don't know my mother. She will not approve of you, Cocoy! She'll just insult you. She'll belittle you. -You're worried she'll belittle me? -Yes. Or are you really worried she'll belittle you? And that's what you can't handle. Your pride or your ego won't let you accept that you're a fool. Because you didn't choose someone as perfect as your husband. Are you insulting me? No, I'm not! I just want you to face the truth. Stop hiding behind your mother. You're not 15, nor are you 25. What does that mean? The reason you cannot stand up for me in front of your mother is because what she will say is the same thing your heart and mind have been telling you. They're saying that no matter how much you deny it, you will still never find it in you to like someone like me. Cocoy... how dare you? I love you! You love me? Yes, Cocoy! I love you! Maybe you're just saying that because you're lonely. I love you... so much. I've loved you for a long time. [Patty sobs] And I can fight for you and stand up for you in front of anyone! But I cannot make you fight for me. Cocoy-- You need to do that on your own. All I can do is love you. I can't force you to like me. So if what you want... is that man and the life that you've always wanted... [mouthing] Cocoy. ...then I can't give you that. [sobs] Cocoy... If you cannot stop yourself from wanting those things, then don't give me a hard time anymore! Cocoy... Don't give yourself a hard time, either. Just let me go. Cocoy... [somber music playing] -How's your uncle? -How's your mom? She hasn't left her room all day. The same goes for Uncle Coy. He hasn't moved or said a word all day. [sighs] How are you doing? You know what? I think I'm okay. I've cried it all out. I realized I never even loved him anyway. More than being heartbroken, I just... I just felt stupid. And it turns out my mom was right about him. I don't mean to rub salt in the wound, but you should learn not to disagree with your mother so much. She often makes valid points, you know? Sometimes, listening to people like us who love you can do you some good. But I'm happy to know that you're starting to feel better. [somber music playing] [sighs] Why? Sorry. -For? -[sniffs] For the things I said and did that hurt you. And I just thought you needed a hug. Thank you, Yanni. Mom? Yes, dear? I'm going back to London. You're back together? [Yanni chuckles] I'm just going there to finish the art workshop, Mom. I just thought it would be a waste to let go of my dreams just because of one heartbreak. I was worried you were going to be like me. No, Mom. I don't want to be like you. Unhappy. No, Yanni. I'm happy. I have you. You could be happier. [sighs] But you're not. You see, Mom... your standards are too high. And there's nothing wrong with that. Having high standards is okay, of course. But sometimes... you tend to have unreasonable expectations of yourself, and of other people, that when we make mistakes, you find it so hard to forgive us, and you also find it so hard to love us. And you know what's even worse, Mom? It's that the person hardest for you to forgive is yourself. You have to be kinder to yourself, Mom. [soft melody playing] Yes, man. I'm leaving for sure. I'll just see you there. I already have a ticket. Yes! Okay, bye. [sighs] Are you sure you want to leave again, Uncle? Of course. -Why do you ask? -Well, I'm just not used to this. You grew up watching me leave, and you're still not used to it? I'm not used to seeing you this sad when you leave. I'm always sad whenever I have to leave my family for work. But that's a different kind of sadness, Uncle. When you leave us, you know you'll have someone to return to once your contract ends. But that's why I became a seaman! That's the best part about my job. Whenever I'm at sea, I can forget all my problems. What if what you're leaving behind isn't a problem? What if it's love? Do you really want to forget that? [Patty] Please take this. Ma, what happened? Yael told me... that you refused his offer to be your date for the reunion! Why? Who are you taking? That boyfriend of yours? Call Yael! Now! And tell him that you changed your mind! Let Mom decide for herself. She's missing her chance to get her family back together again! No. What? Yael and I will never get back together, Ma. I don't love him anymore, and he no longer loves me. And who do you love? That neighbor of yours? Patricia, the problem with you is that you never listen. That's why your daughter won't listen to you either! She listens to me, Ma. So now it's my turn to listen to her. I heard you, Yanni. Ma, the real problem is that she listens to me but she just cannot hear me. Because I am voiceless when it comes to dealing with you. And that's what she doesn't want to emulate. She never wanted to be like me, who could never say no to you, Ma. Because I've always been so afraid that you wouldn't love me if I were anything less than perfect. I'm already 50 years old, Ma. I have done so much. I have been through so much. But it seems that it will never be enough for you. I will never be enough for you. But Cocoy... he never once made me feel that I wasn't enough. I have never been loved that way, Ma. Not even by you. [sobs] So I would like to spend the little time I have left in this world being true to myself. I want to be brave. And you might not like what I will say or do. You may not like who I love. But I will be myself. I will be me. And, Mama... I will choose to be happy. [sobs] Ma... Mama... [sobs] I love you, Ma. [lively music playing] -Ma'am! -What? -Ma'am! Don't forget the... -Oh, no! Just pick all these up. Here. I'm sorry. [Yanni] Ma! -Ma! -What? Oh, right! Yes! Thank you, Yanni. [upbeat music playing] Will you be my date, Coy? [sobbing] Coy? I'm begging you, Cocoy. I love you so much, Coy! Coy? [upbeat music continues] Is Cocoy home? He already left. He went to the reunion? No, he already boarded a ship. What? [door closes] [exclaims] [somber music playing] [Patty] A lot of times in life, we don't get what we want. We don't always end up where we hope to be. Can I be your date instead, Ma? [Patty] And we don't end up being who we expect to be. And that's okay. Because as we gather together in this reunion, and seeing how far everyone else has come along in life, I've realized that success doesn't always mean being the best or having the most. It's about being happy with what you have and with what life brings your way. It's about learning to accept when we are less, yet always still striving to be better. Maybe then, we can all be truly successful. So I would like to thank the people who helped me realize this. First on that list is my daughter. -Yanni, I love you so much. -[Lulu] Cocoy is here! -I love you. -[Lulu] Shh! Don't tell her. I would also like to thank one person... [sighs] ...whom I badly wish was here so I could tell him that... I can finally stand up for him. Because I want to tell all of you how much... how much I love this person. Well, is he our batchmate? [giggling] Yes. What section was he in, then? Six. -[cheering] -[clapping] [woman] I knew it! [indistinct chatter] Can you tell us who he is? -Here? Now? -Yes! Come on, girl! Of course! -[Rachel] All right. Let's hear it. -[chuckles] Let's all just call him... -Cocoy Manlangit of Section Six. -[cheering] [all cheering] Cocoy! Cocoy! Cocoy! Cocoy! Cocoy! Cocoy! Cocoy! Cocoy! Cocoy! Cocoy! [romantic music playing] [clears throat] I thought you had already left. I postponed my trip. Why? Well, my sister called me saying someone wants to take me on a date. [Patty chuckles] So I figured I would give her a chance. So will you dance with me? Can you wait 35 years? Of course! If we'll both last that long, that is. Of course we will! Till death do us part. I love you. What? What was that? I love you, Coy. Louder. [chuckles] I love you. -[Doc] Oh, my God! OMG! -[people cheer] Did you hear that? Section Six, did you hear that? [all] Yes, Cocoy! We did! -Yes! -We're happy for you! [Patty giggles] [sighs] I love you very much. Louder. [laughs] I love you! [Doc] At last! They finally admitted how they feel! -[Lulu] It sure took them a long time! -[Rachel] Finally! [crowd cheering] [Cherie] Oh, my gosh! I love you. I love you, Coy. [batchmate] Oh, my gosh! [all exclaiming] -[woman] Oh, no! -Patty? -Patty! -[woman] What's happening? -What happened to you? -I'm feeling giddy! -Oh, my gosh! -My goodness! -False alarm. -I can't believe her! I see you used my move. That was my move. [all cheering] [Patty giggles] Okay, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Excuse me-- -[Cocoy] Go away or I'll punch you! -[woman] It's time for us to dance. -[Cocoy] Bunch of killjoys. -Continue that later. -Just do that later. -That's enough! Come on. One last! Stop it, you two! Don't you envy them? It's a good thing you came. You missed me, didn't you? [Cherie] Let's do this! I'm still going to London. That's okay. I'll follow you. No. I meant I'll follow you there. I'll follow you when my ship docks there. [tango music playing] [tango music continues] May I have this dance? Yes! I thought I would have to wait 35 years, too! [tango music continues] -[Cocoy laughing] -[Patty giggles] Look at them! Let's show them how to do it. Spin me around. [laughs] I'm sorry. You should spin!
