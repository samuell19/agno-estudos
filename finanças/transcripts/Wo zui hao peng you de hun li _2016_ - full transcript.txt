We're all in Milan, just waiting for you, Editor! Okay, I know. One, two, three. Cheese! Merry Christmas! Thank you for the Christmas dinner. "Merry Christmas! Let's have dinner when you're free." Who's this from? You should ask me before you look at my phone. We're best friends. There are no secrets between us. As a young reporter covering soccer for five years... ...I finally watched the Lega Serie A yesterday. I'd rather try my luck while I'm still young... ...instead of having a job with no prospects. Maybe I will succeed. I never thought that you would have such ambition. Why are you so mean? It's harmless goading. You know I take it to heart. Here, I vow to God: One day, I will become a world-famous reporter! How do you feel right now? What can I say? It's unbelievable. An unbelievable night. Thank you I am going to chase after my dreams, just like you do! --Lin Ran What is it now? Editor, have you arrived at the airport? On my way. Still on your way? You'll miss your flight! Ma Li, this is not my first Fashion Week. But this is your first time there as editor-in-chief. Do you know how busy your schedule is? I've been prepping in Italy for so many days. Please don't miss-- Editor, we have a fully packed schedule this week. Time is tight. Today you've got 13 events. In addition to the fashion shows, you also have other meetings. You can do it! -Send me the schedule through WeChat. -Okay. Editor, what's on your mind? I missed a call. Whose call? Don't know. Telemarketer, maybe. A U.K. number, possibly Lin Ran. Lin Ran? Oh, the quasi-boyfriend! Quasi-what? An unexpected phone call. Maybe it's a confession of love? Double-check the venue details. Editor, what about making him your official boyfriend? Men and women are different. Women have fewer options as they get older. Editor, you've been to Milan with Lin Ran, right? Wow, we're finally here at the Lega Serie A! I told you we wouldn't get in without a ticket. At least we were close to getting in. You always say that. Good morning! It's a pleasure to see you again. Hello, welcome to the Bulgari Hotel. Hello. These are the photos of the event venue. Villa Litta, again. Okay. Should we add some more decoration? Maybe some flowers? My head is killing me. I can't think about these things now. Hey, champagne! Let's have a drink. Editor, we don't have time. We need to get going or we'll be late. Well, I should have time to get changed. Calm down. Editor, a call. Hello? Editor-in-Chief, is your phone working at all? Lin Ran! Wow, it's been a long time. Where have you been? Editor-in-Chief, I saw in the news you arrived in Milan. I have something important to tell you. It's important. Don't tell me you want to leave your job at the BBC... ...to travel the world again. I'm getting married! What did you say? I'm getting married! Yes, the wedding is this weekend. If you have time, you should come to London. Getting married.... She's innocent and wonderful. Her name is Meng Yixuan. I understand that you're busy, but we grew up together. I'm sorry I left last time without saying goodbye. Here's the plan: I will take care of your flight and hotel. You have to come! Editor. Editor, your boarding pass. Editor, are you really leaving? What am I supposed to do without you? I can't handle it alone, Editor. So what now? You suddenly call and tell me that you're getting married? So growing up together means nothing to you? Is this how you treat your best friend? Just notifying me like that? Did you ever ask if I approve? Hey. Try reading if you feel so restless. -You speak Chinese? -Yep. Your English is not bad. Tell me if I have done anything wrong. Why would he marry another girl? Try this. It may ease your nerves. Here. Try it. That was fast! Now can you answer my question? People say that women with high IQs are usually left on the shelf. How could you say that to me?! I really didn't mean it. I just can't control my emotions. My gosh. -Tu Tu! -Lin Ran! Come on! It's been forever. I miss you so much. -Miss me? -Yep. Awesome. Let me introduce you. Come on. Here. This is my fianc?e, Xuan Xuan. This is my best friend, Gu Tu Tu. Stop calling me that. I know I should call you Ms. Gu. Delighted to meet you. You can just call me Gu Jia. Okay, totally. Gu Jia. Hey, where is your luggage? I came in such a hurry, I forgot to bring it. -You are such a good friend. -No wonder. Don't worry. You can try on some of my outfits tomorrow. As long as you don't mind looking kind of girly. She's an editor-in-chief in the fashion industry. She won't have a problem getting pretty dresses. Right. I can get any outfit with just a phone call. How about we go to my house first, then drive you to the hotel tonight? Shall we? Can I say no? Of course... ...not. -Let's go. -Let's go. What do you think of my fianc?e? She's, like, totally young, totally pretty and, like, totally cute. That's how all Post-'90s talk. Totally this, totally that. -Why are you talking like that? -Who says it's only for the Post-'90s? Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I am totally pretty. -What's wrong? -Xuan Xuan, we're coming. Let's open the convertible roof for Gu Jia. Yeah, sure. We'll go to the car first. Look at you. Driving a convertible. Sit tight. Is this car yours? Of course! A fancy car for an editor-in-chief. Gu Jia, how do you like the car? Lin Ran bought it after he got promoted at the BBC. Awesome. Isn't my friend pretty? Of course. She's gorgeous. Thanks. You think just because you look so fancy now... ...I've forgotten how cheap you were back then. I might have been poor, but I was never cheap. Did I ever blink an eye when I bought you three hamburgers? Yeah, but on our trip, who made us share a hotel room to save money? Oh, count your blessings. You slept in the bed, and I slept on the floor. Had our trip lasted longer, I would've had to pawn all my belongings. You know... ...Gu Jia believes that I should always be the one who takes care of the bills. That's not true. You know, the BBC is promoting him to be a producer in America. Lin Ran is really outstanding. There's nothing he can't do. That's enough. She knows how great I am. Stop bragging, or I will have no room to improve. But you are great Enough. I feel like throwing up. I'll get even better in the future. Great. Do you believe me? -Your house? -Yeah. Finally. Help me out of the car. You are always in a hurry. -I want to see your new house! -Lame reason. Small door for such a big house. So classy. I thought your home would be splendid and magnificent. Turns out, it is quite elegant. Gu Jia, come with me. Hey, hold on. This is the ladies' fitting room. Get out of here. Xuan Xuan. Gu Jia... ...you look even prettier in person than in the photos he showed me. You are so young and talented. I would have fallen in love with you if I were him. I think so, too. But he is right. You're too good for him. Did he say that? Look. What do you think of this? Is it nice? It's nice. Is it for the groom? No, it's for the best man. It's made for you. Me? Best man? You'd better get a guy to be the best man. Why me? Gu Jia. Lin Ran always said that you were like his sibling... ...his only family after his parents were gone. I want to surprise him. Can you please be his best man? No way. -I know you will change your mind. -No. Please. I'm begging you, Gu Jia. You're so nice and charming. I'm begging you. Please try it on. I'll be back. Try it on. Try it on! Best man? I came here to be the bride! This should be my dress. Are you ready? Can I come in? Why are you wearing the veil? Thanks, Gu Jia, for trying on the veil. It's very nice and beautiful. Is there something wrong with the veil? No, I just wanted to see how I should put it on. That's right. Hello, I'm Gu Jia. Lin Ran's friend. -Welcome! -So you're Gu Jia. Welcome! Let me show you around. Please make yourself at home. So Lin Ran invited his very best friend. Who knew that Lin Ran's friend was so pretty. Xuan Xuan, you'd better be careful. Dad, Gu Jia is pretty, but what about me? You are my daughter. Of course you are pretty! Did you give birth to her? You would've never had such a beautiful daughter if it weren't for me. Can you give birth to a baby? Then show us. Hey, beautiful. Drink with me. These are all your friends? My only friend is on my left. They're all her dad's friends. I'll introduce them. He's one of the top students at Cambridge. Has three Ph.D.s and two Masters. No wonder he's so sophisticated. Don't be so mean. That one, not good-looking, but he's rich. He's got an annual salary of L3 million! Impressive. It's not possible for everyone to be as handsome as I am. He's a psychiatrist. Enough! Am I on a dating show? Are you seeing someone? Okay. Impossible. For a strong woman like you, finding a partner is difficult. You should hurry up while you are still young. Find someone reliable. I'm sincerely thankful for your concern. Getting old? I think I'm still in good shape. We've been so busy preparing for the wedding... ...arguing over who to invite... ...that we almost called it off. Tu Tu... ...thank you for being here. We're good friends. Of course I have to be here. Let me know if you need anything in London. -Okay. -I gotta go. Hey, Lin Ran. Let's go for a drink. Another day. Xuan Xuan is waiting for me. You know how busy we are. See you at the cake shop tomorrow. I thought that you would quit school and start working... ...after your parents passed away. But you stayed... ...and now you're graduating. I have finally fulfilled my parents' last wish. When I get a real job and save some money... ...I will go travel the world. To our friendship! Beautiful. It's so beautiful here. Stop! Stop! Hey, we're almost 30 years old. There is an old saying: Start your family before your career. What do you think? Sounds good. Are you seeing someone? We are best friends. We grew up together. It would be downright incestuous. Hey! Lin Ran. Gu Jia, my head is going to explode. Do you have a minute? I need to talk with you. Here, come help me. Try this. Give me one minute, and I'll give you the world. Go away. You are here, Ms. Gu. Drop the "Ms." Gu Jia. Look at the way he eats. It's so adorkable. Dorky and adorable. Lin Ran always says what he likes most is my silliness. He loves me so much and always takes care of me. I can't live without him. This cupcake isn't bad. Give it a try. Xuan Xuan. What's wrong? Xuan Xuan. Stop. Too much information. -I'm going to the restroom. -Okay. Forget it. Xuan Xuan's choosing the wine. Shouldn't you be with her? She can take care of it. I'm tired. So, Associate Producer at the BBC... ...your dream finally came true. Yes. So you're going to live in London? Sure. No wonder you look so hot right now. Really? You never approve of my choices. Handsome! Extremely handsome? Don't be ridiculous. I'm just worried. You changed yourself for someone else. When you are really in love... ...nothing else really matters. I've been adrift for so long. Now I finally have somewhere to settle down. Aren't you happy for me? I'm happy for you. Thanks! Have you ever been on a double-decker bus? -Do you want to have a try? -No. I haven't been on one for years. Let's do it. Come on. I'm wearing high heels! Hey, look! Do you remember that summer in Milan? You said we would travel all around Italy on Vespa. Circling the Milan Cathedral. It's so easy to make you happy. It?s been so long since we?ve spent time together. I've been in London for days. Is this how you take care of your guests? My apologies. Today, I'm all yours. I'll take you wherever you want. Okay? Let's go. Wait for me. Come on, lady. Let's go. -Good weather today. -Where are we going? Xuan Xuan Isn't that enough? Lin Ran ? Xuan Xuan Editor, we need you back now! Lots of things are pending your confirmation. I'm still working on something more important than Fashion Week. Send me my luggage as soon as possible. What about here in Milan? Oh, right. I forgot to tell you: You are now promoted to editor-in-chief. -Wait, what did you say? -Good luck! -Bye-bye. -I can't do it-- I'm the editor-in-chief. Let me search on Vipshop. It's almost 10:00 in Beijing. Let me see what's new. So, what did you ask me out for? I asked you out to go shopping with me. Come on. Just spit it out. Yesterday, my mom asked... ...if I was sure I wanted to marry Lin Ran. Then my dad said... ...if I do marry him, maybe he should resign from the BBC... ...and take over my father's company. Resign? I didn't say anything. But when I turned around, Lin Ran was standing right behind me. Then he stormed out in a rage. I didn't even have a chance to explain. So? Gu Jia, what should I do so he will forgive me? You didn't do anything wrong. Why should you be forgiven? I have never seen him so angry before... ...like he would leave me at any moment. Honestly, I think you are still quite young. Are you sure you want to get married this early? Of course. I love him. I have to marry him! I will, and I must! Gu Jia, he's been mad for two days... ...over what my parents said. What's worse, my ex-boyfriend texted me... ...and he saw it. What if he refuses to marry me? Let me think about it. You should just tell him: "If you're going to get mad when others try to be nice to you... ...why should we stay together?" Wouldn't he get even angrier if I say that? Don't worry. Just listen to me... ...and tell him what I said. I'll listen to you, Gu Jia. -Those shoes look amazing on you. -Really? I've heard that Karl's cats make several million euros. Shut up. Listen to me. What? Angelica. -Angelica Cheung? -Yes, of Vogue China. -She's good friends with the big boss. -I know! If she sees you, then everyone will know you aren't in Milan. Send me my luggage right away. Come out. Gu Jia. What's wrong? Where's Lin Ran? I did what you said. My parents just want what's best for us. What do you mean? You know, if you're going to get mad when others try to be nice to you... ...why should we stay together? -Then let's cancel the wedding. -Lin Ran! But Lin Ran just got even angrier. Now he wants to cancel the wedding! Cancel the wedding! Cancel the wedding! What should I do? What should I do? Calm down. Calm down. Calm down! Let me talk to him. I've been looking for you. Why? You know why. You were right. The rich think about nothing but money. But that's not their fault. You are from different backgrounds. It's natural that you have different values. Is that what she said to you? Yep. Do me a favor and tell her... ...she needs to understand: I am who I am. I am marrying her, not her family. Really? So, what should I do now? What to do.... You should know by now how he handles things. Maybe just leave him alone for a while. Leave him alone? Can you ask him to not be left alone too long? Okay, I will talk to him again. That's great! Gu Jia, that's really great! What is it? She said: "The ceremony is soon, friends and family are all coming. Don't make your own life difficult--" Cancel the wedding! "Cancel the wedding"? Hey. Lin Ran! -Lin Ran. -Stop following me. Calm down. -Stop being so mad. -Leave me alone. Hey, I'm in heels! -Are you my best friend? -Of course I am. So you understand me best? Actually, the first time I saw you two... ...I felt like you were from different worlds. She lives in a luxurious house... ...and grew up like a princess. Don't be silly. You don't think that becoming an Associate Producer at the BBC... ...and driving a convertible can give her security. Do you know what she wants? An heir to the family. Wait, what did you just say? An heir. Not that. -Don't be silly. -No. Security! I'm such a jerk. Lin Ran! Gu Jia. Gu Jia. Now I can't help loving you more than ever. Lin Ran is very lucky to have such a great friend. That's good. You know, we've already talked it over. We will speak to my parents together. He is not good at doing business. I won't force him to do anything. As long as he is by my side... ...I have security. That's all I need. Security.... It's good you made up. It's good that you figured it out. Otherwise, he might have started traveling again... ...and left you alone. Wouldn't that suck? Excuse me. -Xuan Xuan. -Never be angry like that again. "Gu Jia, I can't help loving you more than ever." What's happening? Still can't reach her? She's not answering her phone. Don't worry. She's an adult. I shouldn't worry just because she's an adult? She is new in town. You haven't heard from the hotel? Where would she go? What worries me is that she took my car. She can barely drive. This is the U.K. She doesn't even know which side to drive on. What if she's in an accident and someone gets hurt? Hello? Who is this? Why do you have Gu Jia's phone? Don't worry, Gu Jia's fine. She drank a bit much. Where is Gu Jia? I'll come pick her up now! I'll tell her to call you back when she wakes up. Bye. Hey. Hey! Tu Tu! Tu Tu! Tu Tu. Lin Ran. What's wrong with you? He doesn't want me. It's his loss. Why did you drink so much? I'm not a bad-looking girl. Okay, get up. Why doesn't he want me? Lin Ran. No one loves me. Why are you here? Your Lin Ran just called. Lin Ran? How do you know him? I know everything about you guys since you were 3. You know... ...when he was on the phone just now... ...he sounded.... What? Worried about me? Anxious. Let me reintroduce myself. Gu Jia. I'm Nick. What happened? Where were you last night? I was looking for you all night! -You were worried? -Of course! If something happened to you, how could I get married? I'm just a bridesmaid, not the bride! Why are you so mad? -Gu Jia! -Be careful. You're finally here. You don't know how worried he was last night. He almost called the police. -Really? -Yeah. She was at my place. It was you? Nick, my boyfriend. -Hi. -Hi. Congratulations to you. Congrats to you two. Thanks. Okay, why don't we go inside. Let's go. It's rather windy. Where'd this boyfriend come from? Are you really dating? You didn't tell me you were getting married either. This is so sudden. Why can't I have a boyfriend? You got drunk and didn't come back last night. What's wrong with you? This is your first time in London. Do you think that's appropriate? Now all of a sudden you have a boyfriend? Hey, that's not a big deal nowadays, right? Right? -What's the matter? -Right! These are my parents. How are you, auntie? -Congratulations. -He's Gu Jia's friend. Her boyfriend. -Thank you. -A fine young man he is. Hey, Lin Ran is going to go play soccer with the guys. You should invite Nick to join them. Can you play? Lin Ran, come on! Come on! Lin Ran, come on! Come on! You're a good player. So are you. When did you meet Gu Jia? We met a few days ago on the flight to London. What? A few days ago? She caught my eye immediately. Love at first sight probably. Ridiculous! -I think our game is working. -Really? You see the way he's looking at you? Hold me tighter. Do you want to take it to another level? Sure. How? Take a seat. The love between Lin Ran and Xuan Xuan... ...has touched me deeply. So please allow me to make a toast... ...and dedicate a song to the goddess of my heart: Gu Jia. Gu Jia, I've always dreamed of having my wedding in a cathedral. Just like a prince and princess. Baby, no matter where the wedding is... ...you are always my princess. You're my prince, too. Wow, it's so cold. By the way, Gu Jia, I can book this place... -...for your and Nick's wedding, too. -Sure. Baby, I don't think they're getting married anytime soon. That's not necessarily true. We both like to keep things simple. But for the wedding, it has to be a romantic location. -What about Santorini? -Santorini! That sounds amazing. Gu Jia, we need to talk. Baby, I'll be right back. Baby, I'll be right back. Now what? You're already talking marriage after knowing him a few days? You've never been like this. Aren't you getting a little carried away? Not really. -He's handsome. -So what? Can "handsome" pay the bills? -And you want to marry him? -Why are you getting mad? Are you jealous? Jealous? I'm just worried about you! I'm getting married soon. I won't be around to comfort you if he breaks your heart. So don't get married. Is everything okay? We're just talking. Why don't you just take her away from me. What do you mean? We're not allowed to talk? She's my girlfriend now. Stop it. You've known each other for a few days. Do you know how long I've known her? Do you? What? Let's stop making fun of him. Actually, she's not my cup of tea. You are. What's going on here? Gu Jia told me how you worry that she doesn't have a boyfriend. -Right! -So we pretended to be dating. So he is...? You two have gone too far. Pretending to be together. Do you know how worried I was? -I'm just afraid that-- What? So you don't like people like me? I hope it wasn't too much. Let's go. You're wasting too much time on this. It's fun. I told you he still loves you. What you need to do is find an opportunity... ...to tell him that you love him. What? You know what I'm saying. No way! They're about to get married! I'd be crazy to tell him that I love him now! What do I do if he says no? What do I do if he says yes? How do you know if you don't try? I'm going. You can do it. Lin Ran, time flies. I wish we could go back to the old days. Do you remember I told you... ...that I wanted to travel around the world? Of course. And you wanted me to go with you. You're lucky that you didn't follow me. I lost interest in everything by the end. I even thought about jumping in the river. The way you talk is still so dramatic. I think of myself as a firefly. At least I still have that little light on my butt. You wanted to light up the whole world. But I lost that last bit of light later on. And I became no better than a fly. That's not true. You're doing great. I'm not like you. You work like you have a motor inside you. Of course. I try my best and I go for it! I've found my motor now. It's Xuan Xuan. She's different from other girls. She supports me, no matter what I do. I want to be a better man and protect her. I need to be protected, too. I should have given you more support. Ever since my parents passed away... ...you've always been by my side... ...all the time. This may be the last time we get to spend time alone. Not even for a cup of coffee? Marriage is wonderful. It's like a contract. Once you sign, responsibilities follow. Everything changes. You can choose not to sign. Why wouldn't I? I love Xuan Xuan. I love her and only her. She always says, if you love someone... ...you need to shout it out loud, or-- You might lose your chance. You lost your chance again. You still haven't spoken your heart? Speak my heart? Tell him I love him? It's too late. Just find a way to postpone the wedding. How's that possible? It's now or never. I must get the special discount. Hi, Gu Jia speaking. Is this Ma Li? Editor? Can you help me postpone... ...Lin Ran's wedding at the cathedral tomorrow? Postpone it? Editor, are you finally pursuing your own happiness? Editor, we don't need to confirm the event. -It's canceled. -Canceled? Okay, I'll do it now. Thank you. I'm so bad. No matter what happens.... Tu Tu! Tu Tu! Gu Jia! What's going on? The cathedral canceled the wedding! "Canceled"? Wasn't it postponed? "Postponed"? I mean.... Can they postpone it? Hey, can you stop pacing back and forth like that? What can I do? Let nature take its course. Tu Tu, answer me. Every girl has a dream wedding in mind, right? Yes. I must give her the best. My girl has to be the happiest in the world. Stay away from the platform edge. I must think of a solution. Come closer. She's always dreamt of a wedding in a cathedral. I can't even make that happen. You always give her whatever she wants! If she truly wants to marry you, does the location really matter?! Come closer. It's dangerous. Aren't you coming in with me? I'll be there in a minute. Okay. Ma Li, I told you to postpone the wedding. Why did you cancel it? What? What was canceled? The wedding! Editor, I forgot to tell you that I couldn't reach them. Couldn't reach them? Yeah. It was canceled? Editor, it's probably meant to be. Really? Editor, you must take this chance. As long as you are happy, I can do anything. Do you like this place? Great! I will listen to you regarding all family matters. Okay, baby? Okay. Tu Tu, come here. You were right. I told Xuan Xuan about the cancellation. I guess I got worried over nothing. She said that the location isn't important. What's important is that we're together. Take the call. Baby! -Are you choosing the bouquet? -Yeah, look at this. Editor, you can do it! This one is good. -Yeah, this one is pretty. -Yes. It's so easy to make you happy. I came here to be the bride! How do you know if you don't try? There should be more roses at the wedding venue. So beautiful. What is this place? Right, baby? Hey, Lin Ran. I think I found a place for the wedding. Really? Awesome! You look great. Why aren't you ready yet? I've just finished an event. I'll get changed. How's Xuan Xuan? Relax, I got her the best hairdresser and makeup artist. She's in good hands. By the way, you aren't allowed to see the bride before the ceremony. Thank you. If you really want to thank me... ...take a walk with me. Do you remember this place? Stop! Stop! Lin Ran, I need to tell you-- Tu Tu. Before you say anything, I'd like to ask you something. Okay. Did you ask Nick to cancel the wedding at the cathedral? I've been investigating. I heard back from the cathedral. They said someone named Nick canceled it. I didn't ask him to do anything! Why did he do that? Tu Tu... ...why?! Why did you ask him to cancel my wedding? You're my best friend... ...the most important person in the world to me. I invited you to my wedding, hoping to share my happiness. I remember it was exactly here... ...where you asked me... ...if I could give you a chance and be with you. I want to say yes now. If the wedding must go on... ...I wish I could be the bride. If you also want to be with me... ...I can be the bad guy... ...and explain everything to the guests. Lin Ran... ...choose me. I will bring you happiness. Tu Tu... ...stop it. It's in the past. I need to protect someone else now. Don't be like that. I understand. Xuan Xuan! Xuan Xuan! Xuan Xuan! Xuan Xuan! Stop, Xuan Xuan! It's not what you think! Xuan Xuan! Stop chasing me! Stop! Stop. Xuan Xuan! Xuan Xuan. Xuan Xuan! Xuan Xuan! Xuan Xuan! Xuan Xuan! Don't come any closer, or I'll throw myself against the wall! Go ahead. I can be the bride if you're dead. I knew I was right. You are in love with Lin Ran! Right! The whole world knows, except you. You finally admit it. You tricked us into coming here to try to win him back. I'm telling you that is not gonna happen! Yes... ...I have been trying to get him back Because I never thought he would leave me one day. You know... ...I really disliked you the first day we met. You were so cute and innocent. It made me sick. But in Lin Ran's eyes... ...you are precious. He would do anything to protect you. And me? To him, I will always be his best friend. You will regret it, as I do, if you don't go back now. Xuan Xuan! Xuan Xuan! Xuan Xuan. Xuan Xuan. Marry me. Tu Tu, trust me. You will find your own happiness. Hey... ...I'm here.
