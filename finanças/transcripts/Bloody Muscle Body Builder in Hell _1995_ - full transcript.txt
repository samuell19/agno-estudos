SOMEWHERE IN TOKYO DURING THE EARLY 70' Unforgivable! I'll never allow it! You think you can marry another woman?! You belong to me. I'll never give you up! Oh my... So much blood. It hurts... You belong to me... 30 YEARS LATER Hello? Wakabayashi speaking" Yes? Oh, Mika? Long time no speak! What photograph? The photo of that house? Oh that? It's around here somewhere... Is that so? OK, sure. I'll dig it out. So work is going well, huh? Yeah that article on haunted locations has been keeping me busy. Oh yeah? Have you gotten any ghost photos yet? Yep. Well, they're all photoshopped images actually. Oh really? What other kind of things do you write about? Oh you know, special features for ladies magazines and stuff... -How about you? -Huh? Are things different now? Me? I quit my job. Oh? When? A year ago. Right after you and I broke up. So...what about now? What kind of work are you doing? Nothing in particular. Oh, I started working out again six months ago. A guy needs muscles after all! You've really not done anything this whole time? Well, you know my folks passed away at a young age... I don't have anyone to care for these days, so... I just figured I'd take it easy for the time being. I see. Let's find somewhere to sit and chat. Sure. Oh right... Here's that ghost photo you asked for. Yes, this is it! This photo gave me shivers the first time I saw it! Is the house still there? Yeah. It's practically falling apart though. Did you use to live here? Nope. I didn't even know the house existed until after my father died. I don't know the exact details but apparently it belonged to my father before he got married. That reminds me... I have one more photo from around the same time. The man in the photo... Yeah, that's my old man. You look exactly like him! Who's that next to him? Your mother? I have no idea. Maybe it's just an old girlfriend of his? You got a light? Nope. You probably don't wanna hear this but... Just one of those things can deplete your vitamin C levels by as much as 75mg at a time. Your beauty will suffer for it. Hey, can you show me the inside of the house sometime? I want to make that house the main focus of my article. I smell trouble! That weekend, Mika drove us to the dreaded house. A psychic by the name of Mizuguchi also joined us. Is the house a total mess inside? No, not at all. It's surprisingly tidy actually. Here you go. Oh, thank you. So, have you been inside the house? Yeah, just last month. I moved my barbell into the basement. I'm thinking of tidying it up and using it as my own personal gym. There's even enough room for a large training machine. What a good idea. Training in a haunted house sounds like a fun hobby. Come on, there's no such thing as ghosts. I guess you can't see them then. That's fine by me. I can't see them anyway. To me, they don't exist! We're being watched. What? I can sense something looking at us. It's sending evil thoughts in our direction. There's definitely something in that house. Only the electricity is still running. It's OK, you can keep your shoes on. What's in here? That's the basement. Wanna check it out? No, I'll look later. This is the kitchen and that's the living room. The bathroom is over there. Incredible... This is the place. Incredible. This is the place. Idiot! It's stale as hell in here. Don't let in the light! My deepest apologies, master. Can you feel anything? There's an ominous presence emanating throughout the house. Particularly in this room. A young girl perhaps? She bears a terrible grudge. I shall try summoning her. Come out. I know you're here. Show yourself! Welcome home... What's wrong with it? I've no idea... Man I suck at mechanics... It's no use. I'm clueless. What shall we do? Call the road services? Nah, let's get the psychic to take a look once he's awake. Really? Think he can fix it? More than likely. He has special powers right? Are you alright? Yeah... The clock fell on your head. I thought you were dead for a moment there. Fell on my head? But I was in the middle of the room... What's wrong with the car? The engine won't start. It's that woman. What? The woman that was standing behind you in that room. Her hand was on your shoulder for some reason. Give me a break! That woman is confined to the house. She's the one that dropped the clock too. Give me the key. You're going back in there? This time I'm going in alone. Give me the key. Here. I'm gonna find out who she is. I'm coming too! I'll be better off alone. You'll only distract me. You need me, don't you? Let's hear what you have to say. My body has become rotten to the core! Give me that body of yours! Somethings not right. He's been gone too long. I guess. He's been gone about 20 minutes now, right? It's been longer than that! Shouldn't we go and see if he's alright? Sure but, won't he get annoyed if we just waltz in? Something might have happened to him! Jeez, that guy's a pain in the ass! OK, let's go. Master! We're heading back now! Naoto... Yeah... Hey! Where are you? Let's get outta here and call the police! Leave this place! Quick! Leave while I'm still alive! Shit! It's no use, it won't open! I've finally obtained a body of living flesh! I see you've returned. I've been waiting for you! I'm gonna take good care of you! I'll bite your face off! Naoto! Hold it shut! Let me outta here! What do you see in that girl anyway? Let me out! What happened to him? What the hell is going on here?! How should I know?! What are we gonna do? Let's just get outta here! Let me out! Damn it! Let me outta here! We're screwed. It won't move an inch. What's happening to this place? It's like the entire house is under some kind of weird spell. Why don't we shout for help? Forget it. Nobody will hear us. So what do you suggest we do?! Hey don't get mad at me! You're the one that wanted to come... Naoto. Dad? Huh? Naoto. That man has become possessed by the spirit of my ex-lover. What? I killed her. Right here in this house. You killed her? That woman had lost her mind completely. It couldn't be helped. I never meant to kill her. I get it now! That woman has mistaken you for your father! Mistaken? That may be so... No. I think it no longer matters to her whom you may be... Then why is she doing this?! She's sick in the head. She's enjoying this. She won't stop until she's tormented you both to death. You gotta be kidding me! The door won't open and we can't get out. What should we do? She's not powerful enough to keep you here. It's the psychic that's to blame. She's using his powers to keep you here. Without the body of that psychic, she is totally powerless. If you wish to leave here alive... You must hack his body to pieces. You must destroy him. How?! That woman is blocking my energy. I'm out of time. Go into the basement, Naoto. The weapon you need can be found down there. What was that? It came from the bathroom! I'm gonna strangle her before your very eyes! Damn it! Let her go! Hey, Mika! Mika, are you alright? Hey, snap out of it! Mika! Hey, it's me! It's OK, relax! It's over. I got him good. Naoto! This is hopeless. The damn thing won't open! It won't open? Why?! We did as we were told and hacked him to pieces, didn't we?! You think you can just run away? I told you you're not going anywhere. I'm not gonna let that ugly bitch have you! Now what? Let's burn him. Listen up. Once we've ignited the fire, we need to close the kitchen door and head straight to the entrance. If what my old man says is true, the door should open once he's burnt out. Hey, where are you taking me? This is all of him. What are you gonna do? Did you draw this? Yep. It's a self-portrait. Do you like it? This is farewell! Huh? I was asking for your lighter? I haven't got one. Don't you have one? Of course not, I don't smoke! You're a smoker aren't you? God knows how many times I've told you to quit. Well I took your advice! Really? I'm glad to hear that... Looks like I'm gonna hack you to a pulp with my axe then! That's not nice. Anything but that! I got it! The basement! Wow. Is that real? Yeah. I knew that my father was obsessed with firearms but, I had no idea he had this kind of thing hidden away. Groovy. OK! I'm gonna blow him away! Wait a second. Huh? There's parts missing... Behind you! He's still around. Be careful. Right. Bastard! Now it's payback time! Mika! Mika, are you alright? Mika! Wake up! It's OK. I'm gonna get us out of here! Come on... You gotta be shitting me! Son of a bitch! What's the meaning of this?! This isn't how you said! I hacked him up into little pieces like you told me! Damn it! What the hell am I supposed to do?! What now?! Mika! Why you! You pathetic worm. You couldn't even protect your girlfriend? You gutless bastard! Go into the basement, Naoto. There you will find your weapon. Your true weapon! My weapon? Now! know what it is. It ain't no gun! My weapon is... My muscles! Muscle! Now I'm pumped! Hey assholes! You ain't human! Come get some! You belong to me! Over my dead body! Goodbye... Baby! Don't take it personally. You're just not my type! You idiot! Wow! That wasn't so hard! Give me your body! That's it! See you in hell, baby! Let's get outta here. Yeah...
