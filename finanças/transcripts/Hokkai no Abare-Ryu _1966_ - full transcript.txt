TOEI COMPANY, LTD. I won't do it again. Stop. It's not their fault. They just came to help us. Why are you doing this? Damn you. - Hey, hey, hey. - How dare you? Young Master! Stop. This is because you've defied my father. The fish caught in this sea must all be sold to us. Huh, I can sell my fish wherever I want. - What? You bitch! - Let her talk. I won't let you join with the Yamagatas. Now you know what happens to folks who try to sell fish without going through us. Or is there still anyone who doesn't understand? All right, back to the harbor. Get on your boats and go. Murderer! Your pa is also a murderer. - Damn you! - Shinkichi! Damn them. Looks like things went well. How did the Yamagatas take it? Same as always. They can't do a thing.

Thanks. Hey, man. How's business? - You don't look too happy. - You have no idea. Go back to the fisherman's hut. My people are at the hut? They're working hard. Only one working boat? Who's there? Oh, it's you Shinkichi. Brother Jiro. What are you doing with that? Ma! Ma! Hey! Jiro! Long time, Ma. Fool! You fool! What's the matter? Yakuza! You're not wanted here. Get out. That's how you greet me after a three year absence? - You haven't changed. - Your good for nothing. Get out! Get out. Jiro, come. Your good for nothing. Toshio. Don't let him in. Ignore him. You're living in the hut? - What happened to the house? - We sold it. Hmm... I see. You've come down in the world. What happened? The boats outside are rotting... Without fishermen, the boats can't sail. There are lots of fishermen at the port. You don't know the situation. Jiro, look. Pa! He's dead. - Jiro, Pa... - Shut up. Leave me alone. Jiro? Hi, Rei. Long time. It's been three years. Where have you been? Here and there. What? Still no one willing to marry you? You're still the same. Sure. What about you? I'm sorry about your family. About you father... Can't be helped. It was his time to go. His time? Are you kidding? He was murdered. What? I thought you knew... Who? Who killed my pa? The guy who actually did it is in prison. But he's Ashida's underling. Ashida must have ordered it. But there's no one who will testify to that. Hey, don't slacken the pace. Shut up and stand aside, old man. He told you, Pa. Leave the heavy lifting to the young ones. Don't count us out, right, Boss? Age doesn't matter. Here it comes. It's a big catch! I'm buying everyone a drink. You fool! - You ingrate! - Pa, don't. Leave him alone, Toshio. It's Jiro's fault for disrespecting our business. - Brother! Apologize! - Shut up! I quit being a fisherman. I'm not spending my life in this stinking village. You degenerate. After you got my tattoo... - Pa! - Leave. I'm disowning you. Get out, right now. That's great. I feel great. - Jiro! - Madam! - Damn you! - Jiro, apologize. Jiro, I know you were acting like a goon because you wanted me to inherit the business. - No, I... - I know. Pa also realized it later. Pa did? He was thinking about you. I wanted to let you know but didn't know where you were. Where are you going? Jiro! Ashida! I'll hear what you have to say and tell Pops. Hey, pour water on him. That wasn't smart. You shouldn't go near a crazy man. If you hurt your bodyguard, you're just throwing money away. Stop it, you two. This is no time for internal squabbles. Oh, your father's tattoo is in bad shape. Damn! Murderer! You're mistaken. I didn't do it. That's what the judges decided in court. There's nothing more official than that. I should roll you in a mat and drop you into the sea. But let this be a lesson to you and behave like your brothers. Hear me? Damn you! Hey, Go! - Are we going to kill him? - What? We don't have to go that far. Since we busted the heads of two rising dragons they've been reduced to a harmless snake. Koro, there's smart and stupid people in the world. Aren't you glad you don't belong to this stupid guy? Young Master? Master Jiro, It's me. - Some? - You've come to. That's good. I was shocked. Ma, lend a hand. Young Master, it's Oritsu. What did you do? Look at your injuries. You're in the way. What? Then you went all alone to the Ashidas? Yep, I got mad as hell. Hang on a bit longer. But you are the head of the dragon. - You went in all alone. - I agree. But if you had let me know, upon the honor of my dragon's tail, I wouldn't have let this happen. - Really? - Don't be ridiculous. Your tail has been between your legs for a while. You kowtow to them every day. Ma, you keep talking about my tail... but there's more in the tail than... Stop talking nonsense. I don't know how to apologize to you. After what happened to your pa... you may think I'm making excuses, but... I'm mad as hell, too. But they are a big company. One or two of us making a fuss wouldn't change a thing. It's not just a matter of numbers. No, Oritsu. Some is right. Look what happened to me. You can't win just by being reckless. What are you going to do? - You're not going to keep quiet? - I don't know. I'll give it some thought. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. - Are you all right? - It's nothing. You take him home. You're only in the way of my business here. All right, you don't need to rub it in. The story is I got drunk and got hurt in a fight. All right? - But why? - Never mind. All right? Sure. Some? He got drunk and picked a fight? - Yes. - He's incorrigible. Was good but it was too much... - Where do I sleep? - Fool! There's no place for you to sleep. Don't be so mad. - Get out! - Ma! - Madam! - Ma! - Pa was... - I heard. He was killed. What's to be done about it now? Right? You knew this and went and got drunk? I'm disowning you again. Get out. Calm down, Madam. I can understand how Jiro must feel. I don't. I won't. I don't. I don't. Well that's that then. I'll sleep in one of the boats outside. Young Master. Some! He didn't get those injuries in a fight. What about it? He went all alone to Ashida. I see. I guessed as much. Hey Toshi, keep counting. Hey Aida, I'm thinking three a basket. That's too low. I could get five anyplace else. You're not happy with our price? I'm saying us fishermen will starve. They seem fit to me. Take another look. - No one's fit. - Shut up. If you complain, we won't pay anything. Hey, you guys okay with that? Say something! Aida, we'll accept the price. Three's good. Nothing we can do. Three, then. You think I'll accept after the trouble you caused? Hey, Aida, down on your knees and apologize. - Boss! - Any complaints? Toshi! I'm sorry. Why didn't you say that in the first place? Give it to him. Pa! Welcome home. I heard. They gave you a hard time. Mister! Mr. Aida, it's been a while. What happened to you? This? I raided the Ashida and killed him. That's not funny. Mister, how's business? What does it have to do with a playboy like you? He hasn't changed. I know how you feel about your father but don't do anything too rash. They'll find out what Ashida did some day. - Hey, Reiko! - Yes? See you. Jiro. Hey, Toshi. You've grown. - Did Shinkichi tell you? - What? It's okay if he hasn't yet. Bye. What's with him? Damn! I hate this. If we keep going like this, Pa won't rest in peace. Jiro's back, too. Let's get together... kill Ashida... Fool. - We can't kill him. - He killed my pa! That doesn't mean it's okay to kill him. Besides, they're yakuza. They have guns. You think Pa will be happy if we die for nothing. Say what you will. You're afraid of him, aren't you? - Shinkichi! - It's okay, Ma. He's too young to understand. Hey, why the long faces? - Young Masters. - Rikizo, pay him no mind. I don't care. But at least you can feed me. Go rummage in the garbage. All right, I will. - Brother Jiro. - Shinkichi! Hi, again. You want to talk to me? You will understand. I can't stand it any longer. - What? - Everything. - So Ashida... - You're going to kill him? And you want me to help? Yeah, Toshi's with us. I can't watch the fishermen getting trampled on any longer. - Don't even think about it. - Brother Jiro. Why? Why not? You won't stand a chance. You'll get killed. - If everyone helps... - Who's everyone? The three of us... Idiot. This isn't a schoolyard fight. - I won't do it. - Brother Jiro. You're talking rot. You think this is a revenge movie? Idiot! Then you're okay with this? Don't you hate him? Sure. But I only have one life. By the way, have you guys been with a girl? If you haven't, I'll take you tonight. Coward! You want a beating too? You stay out of this. - Hey. - Shut up. Shinkichi, are you okay? Stand up. Get up. Once more. Stop it. Once more. Shinkichi, stop. Enough is enough. Hey, stop. Shinkichi. Got it now? You can't win a fight just by charging in. - Hey, guys! - Working late? Want to double your pay? What about it? We're gambling tonight. Wanna come? How about it? You won't come? Hey, come with us. - We'll let you win. - You just got paid, right? Not that way. This way. Step on it. Place your bets. Come on guys, bet. Hey, put your bets down. Not much of a bet. Next. Me, too. I've never seen such a small bet. - What do you want? - I want to join in. Wait till the next round. Okay, here goes. It's two and seven. Any one have a better hand? - Nope. - Thanks. Next round. Let's put it on that one. A couple on this one? Hey. To split your bet is called a pauper's bet. - Don't interfere. - Leave us alone. Listen to me... Don't give them ideas. I have a big mouth. Place your bets. Didn't I tell you? - Where are you going? - I'm broke. - What's this? - It's for my wife and kid... I'll do it for you. How's this? Wait a second. Place your bets on that. No, I'm not lucky today. That's why you have to make your own luck. - Show your guts. - Yeah, but... Then watch. I'm placing five on the last one. One more. It's a big one. - Hey Brother... - What is it? Could you bet for us, too? Oh, weren't you hedging your bets? Bet for yourselves. Shouldn't try to win on other people's bets. Please, just once? I was forced to come and they took my rice money. Please? Do as you like? I'm betting on this. Next. You have a good hand? Here we go. The dealer wins. What's this? Are you in on this? Idiots! Do you know what gambling is? You either win or lose when you bet. That's what gambling is all about. Just because you lost one don't cry like a girl. That's good advice. So another round with a bigger bet? I'll bet against all the money the dealer won tonight. You have money to cover if you lose? - I'm betting my labor. - Labor? I'm young. If I have to work for you free for life that's a huge return. Interesting. I'll go for it. THE CHERRY BLOSSOM CARD One more. It's a royal flush. When it rains it pours. See guys, this is how betting is done. Bit by bit is no good. Passive betting is no good. Hoping for others to help is even worse. This is the same as being in a fight. Remember this. - Bye. - Wait a second. - Win and run? - Stop it. You're the winner tonight. It looks like we'll keep running into each other. I guess. What's the matter? Can't go home without the money? Or your wife will beat you up? Here you go. Stop! Don't let your family see you like this. Remember this. What's with the scary faces? They killed your father and you play with them? No. I just wanted money. - What? - You don't like it? I gave the fishermen back their money. What's the fun in cheating to get money from those who can't afford it? I don't cheat. I also taught them how to fight. - To those losers. - How dare you! You no good son of the fisherman boss! If you want to get mad, don't just get mad at me. Jiro! Jiro? Wait. I know your father's death is painful. I don't blame you for drinking. But tonight? You got money from the poor people because you wanted money to buy alcohol. - You're bad. - I agree. Bad, bad. I'm disappointed in you. You're beautiful when you're angry. You good for nothing drunk. I'm horny as well. - Hey! - Welcome. I came to get our rent. - Rent? - You didn't know? The Ashida is managing sthis territory. Here's the invoice. - That's ridiculous. - Oh, yeah? You object? Hey, you want me to upend this cart? Just pay them. Let sleeping dogs... lie. Listen to him. How much? Should have given it up when I asked, bitch! Says who? - Thief! - Don't make them mad. They have their way 'cause we don't stand up to them. You, too. Just because they hurt you, you do as they say? I've always been a coward. - Hey Some. - What? I value my life, but also my little brother's. Is Shinkichi up to something? Yeah. He might do what I did. So if you see him around town, let me know. Toshi, too. - But they're both kids. - Fool. They're more foolhardy than I am. If it goes bad, they'll get killed. I guess. A coward's no good but you've got to stay alive. You're right. I'm counting on you. Hey, I've been looking for you. What do you want? I don't gamble for charity. I can't keep giving. Damn. I'm getting angry. Didn't I tell you? See? Come, come. You amateur. Damn! Come to Daddy. Come, come. Here's my bet. Come on. Sure thing. Keep taking it off. I'm in luck. One more. You got me again. - Total 1,280. - Damn. - I'll bet my underwear. - Stop. I don't want to see your goods. I quit. Don't say that. We've just begun. What's this? I want to buy something with this. Buy? How many guns do Ashida have? - Guns? - Yeah, rifles. I see. You want me to sell information? Instead of inciting the fishermen you're going to do it yourself? Your answer? Only one rifle. It's the one the crazy kid has. How many underlings? Including the small fry, about forty. But only one to be reckoned with. Who's that? This guy. - I see. - Goes without saying. But this information isn't much use. - This is still yours. - No. I'm loaning it to you. Buy some new underwear. Only one rifle... It was a mistake relying on your brother. We don't need his help. But are you really going to do it? Sure, why ask now? It's not just to avenge your father. I have the fishermen's welfare as a just cause. All right. We'll do it at the next festival. Yeah, it has to be at the festival. Right. That's the best chance we have. The festival's grand but our lives suck. Here, let me. You? Serving me? I want to go to the festival. Just getting on your good side. I see. You're so practical. Thank you. In the olden days, when there was a festival we had fireworks on this shore. We used to dance all night. I remember. The good old days. Nowadays it's a festival for the Ashida. It's the boss. - Congratulations. - Have a good time, boys. Please sit. Thanks for your help. - Don't mention it. - Here, Boss. The fireworks are ready? It went well. Oh, Shinkichi? Why are you naked? Some! You're here. You've come to the festival? What's that? Something good? It's a firework. You stole it! - You're still mischievous. - Fool. It's not a prank. They're dangerous so... Stop it. This doesn't concern a drunk like you. Oh, I get it. You're going to blow Ashida away. We have no time for drunks. Wait. Are you two serious? Of course. I don't think it'll work. Just you watch. Hey, I can trust you to be quiet about this? Hey kid! Not to worry. They won't succeed. It's grand! What's that? Damn. One more. There! Shinkichi! Shinkichi! What's the matter? Hang in there. Shinkichi! Shinkichi! Talk to me. Shinkichi! What happened? Brother Jiro. Where's Toshi? Don't worry. He's okay. I wanted to do it... together with you. Didn't I tell you to wait? You jumped the gun. - Damn. - I couldn't wait. Just like before... when we got together and the dragon became one... I wanted to go fishing together again. Maybe I should have waited. I failed. I'm leaving the rest in your hands. Shinkichi! Shinkichi! All right. I got it. Shinkichi! Shinkichi. Shinkichi... Shinkichi! How could this happen? Shinkichi! I'm sorry. You asked me to be on the lookout. But I got drunk and forgot. I'm so sorry this happened. That's not good enough. - You're... - Enough. It's all in the past. I'm also one of you. If you're going to raid the place again, take me with you. Please. Please? Jiro? Then it wasn't a fight? Yeah... You were just pretending to drink and gamble. I thought we had to bide our time. And I wanted a strong ally. Shinkichi felt the same. But he couldn't wait until we had our forces together. We don't like kowtowing to them. Yeah, we want to destroy Ashida, too. - But... - But what? Look Jiro. Not everyone is the same. Our characters and positions are different. Some are strong, some are weak. - So you can't side with us? - Jiro. That's not true. These people stayed with us till the end. We hear you had a death. We came to pay our respects. - How dare you! - Please leave. We can't let you near the deceased. Is that so? Then we have something to give you. Hey! Toshi! I'm sorry, Jiro. He told us, Shinkichi tried to kill my father and stole some fireworks. That's what exploded. Which means they're guilty of attempted murder. We wanted to take them to the police but the boss said to bring him here out of respect. But let me say this. Don't defy my father again. It won't last long anyway. Is that all you have to say? Then leave. We're in mourning. All right. Who the hell told you to take the day off? The harbor is really busy. Get back to work. How dare you! They came to show their respect. Which side are you going to listen to? Wait a second. Ma'am? - We're leaving now. - Father! Boss! How long are you going to stand for this? Everyone? Aida? Shinkichi said this before he died. That he should have waited. We'll keep waiting. Why can't we take the boats out? Let us take the boats out. Shut up. Quiet. Or I'll kill you. Coming through. Why are you doing this? Why can't we take the boats out? The fuel will cost more than the catch. What? Look, they're dumping the fish. Why? Why are you doing this? If the price comes down further, we'll lose money. Don't. We put our souls into catching those fish. - How can you do this? - Shut up. - He's right. Please stop. - What? We can't close our eyes any longer. Are you defying us? Hit me as much as you want. I won't leave. - Stop. - Don't. Boss! Hey, anyone else who won't leave? Step forward. What are you doing? It's not good. If the fishermen and Yamagata join forces... Shall we kill again? - Let Kumai do it. - Kumai? If he kills Jiro, we won't have to have him around. So you'd kill Kumai as well? I don't like the looks of him. But... don't go to extremes. No, I'm okay. - I have a request. - What is it? We just want to fish. But if we do, they just throw our catch away. So I want to unload on your beach and work with your family to sell our fish. Talk to my brother. Yeah, but our outlet is small. Right, Riki? If you brought all of your catch to us, it will rot. I know. I'm asking you to expand your outlet. Then we'll have nothing to fear. Right? We're prepared to defy Ashida. Like Boss said, we're not going to be meek anymore. Brother? It was worth waiting. Toshio, agree to work with them. The four of us will find more outlets. Even if we have to beg them to take it. The Yamagata family can't exist without fishermen. The unused boats outside are a good example. Thank you Ma'am. All right, let's do it. I'll go to Imahoro. You go to Horomi harbor. Riki and Some, go to every port on the western shore. I knew you were going to inherit the business, Toshi. Let's get moving. Watch it. You! Get out of the way. I'm in a hurry. Get out. I don't want to kill you without warning. What? Koro! Damn! Koro. Koro! Our talks went well. But Jiro's late. Water! More water! The house! Damn. It's them. Stop. It's dangerous. Water. Bring more water. - What? - Your ma's inside. - Give me that. - It's too dangerous. - Jiro! - Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma. Ma! Ma! - Is she all right? - Auntie? I'm sorry. You always help us and we can't do a thing in return. Not to worry. We can build another house. We're alive and well. That's right. Ashida made a big mistake. He didn't just set fire to the house and boats. He lit a fire under us as well. Yeah, a bonfire. - I want to put it out. - We will, before high tide. Before high tide? Yup. You can't stop me. - Then you're all agreed? - Of course. We can't leave it just for Jiro to handle. I guess this is no job for a woman. I won't stop you. Jiro, I'll help. Boss, you won't stop us will you? They didn't just attack them. We're all in the same boat. All right, Jiro. We'll go with you. No, this is our responsibility. I want you all to go out and fish. - Fish? - Right. Since we now have buyers. - The fish won't wait. - But... You'll be most helpful by going fishing. What do you mean? Listen. Right now, they're... I don't think they will but be on your guard. That's the plan. Will you do it? - Sure. Right? - Yes. We'll scatter the hoodlums and take the boats out. Hurry, then. It's almost daybreak. - Jiro be careful. - You, too. See him off. Let's go. Here we go. What are you doing here? You need the boats to go fishing, I bet. You've come to take the boats. If you don't want to get hurt, go home. Let's do this. Go. I said go. Get out of the way! - Stop. - What do you want? So you've come. I can't let you pass. - Get out of our way. - Shut up. I changed my mind. I'm switching sides. You're a curious one. My family member was killed, too. Although my little brother had a tail. But he was family just the same. - All right, let's go together. - But they're not home. What? Father and son headed for the port. They got word the fishermen were there. Okay, we have to hurry. - The Yamagata sons... - What? Now. Hey, get the boats out. - There's five. - Go double crossed us. Pops, get out. I can handle them. - Are you sure? - Get out! Ashida! Damn. Don't stop. Keep moving. - Don't chase them. - Shut up! Gen! Gen! Gen! Gen! Hey! It's just a scratch. Stay with me. This tattoo was bad luck after all. Fool, you can't go. You owe me. That's not it. I avenged my dog Koro. Go! Go! Ashida! Are you all right? Gen! Gen! Talk to me. Gen! Brother? Everyone looks happy. Yeah. That must be the right way to live. Go help them. And you? I have things to take care of. Jiro, then you're taking the blame alone? - That's not good. - Stop. If we're all in prison, what'll happen to Ma? - But... - Brother. You, too. Each person has a unique character. Disrespecting parents is my role as usual. Your jobs are over there. Let's not muscle in on each other's territory. The village is full of life again. I bet Pa's happy, too. THE END
