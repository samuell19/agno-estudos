You are a magician Arvo. - No, you're the magician, Mrs. Claus. - Well, what counts is we've done it all together. I mean, look at these wonderful teddy bears. They stand up to a lot of loving and that is the most important test. - [Elf] Oh yes it is. - And, now you can all go home a week early. (elves gasping) And, have the very merriest Christmas. Oh, aren't you tickled, Arvo? I mean, with all of the toys made, the only thing left is the delivery. Of course, Santa will take care of that and you'll be able to spend a real Christmas Eve at home with your family. - What about you, Mrs. Claus? Another Christmas Eve alone? - After the first hundred years or so, you get used to it. - [Santa] More mail? - Nicholas-- - [Elf] That's not all. - More mail. Well, don't worry, darling, there are plenty of toys for these children and much more. Here's your cocoa, dear. Nicholas, if you have a moment, there's something that I'd like you to take a look at. - Is it me, or are there more children in the world every year? - Well, as it happens, there are, which is why I was looking over your navigational maps. - Yes, yes, sounds very interesting. - You see, if you change course here and head off in an easterly direction-- - Oh, Easter is lovely. Course it's no Christmas, but-- - Nick, (chuckles) you haven't heard a word I've said. - Yes, I have. You wanna serve a new course for Easter. Bread pudding's always nice, don't you think? (Mrs. Claus sighs) - Oh, Nick, I wish you'd let me help you with the mail this year. - They write to Santa Claus. They're gonna have their letters read by Santa Claus. Now, call me old fashioned, but I only know one way to do this job and that's to do it right. - We're getting behind, chief. I've never seen this much mail. - But, I haven't made a dent in the last batch. (letters clattering) Wait! - Do you suppose there's a letter in there addressed to both of us? Oh, didn't think so. Well, at least drink some of your cocoa while it's still warm. Oh, it's very chilly in here. I think someone must've left a window open. Oh look! (dramatic music) You can see it tonight. - Oh, the North Star. Nearly as bright as on Christmas Eve. - When it guides you safely home to me. Don't want to catch a chill, do we. (Santa chuckles) Well, if you don't need me for anything... - And, there's always the naughty ones with the bad handwriting. Hmm, did you say something, Anna? - Oh, no, no, nothing at all. ♫ I need something challenging to do ♫ Somewhere marvelous to go ♫ He's seen every little corner of the world ♫ All I've ever seen is snow ♫ I'm Mrs. Santa Claus ♫ The invisible wife ♫ And Mrs. Santa Claus needs a change ♫ In her life ♫ I've been manning the business ♫ And planning each holiday plan ♫ And I'm tired of being the shadow behind the great man ♫ For each December when Santa's checking his list ♫ 'Tis the season that he forgets I exist ♫ So the moment has come to beat my own drum ♫ Because ♫ I want the world to know there's a Mrs. Santa Claus Arvo, hitch up the reindeer, please. - The reindeer? - Where are you going? - I'm going to try out this map. I just know that this new route will save gobs of time. - Yeah, but what about the chief (mumbles)? When are you coming back? - Well, I'll be back before morning, dear. Just tell him that I've gone out for a little spin around the world. - [Arvo] Please guys, look after her. ♫ I'm Mrs. Santa Claus ♫ Yes, I'm married to him ♫ And for centuries I've been proper and prim ♫ But I'm tired of folding the bedding ♫ And spreading the jam - [Arvo] Oh boy! ♫ And I feel I'm about to begin to find out who I am ♫ I've planned my strategy and my flag is unfurled ♫ For I have gifts of my own to offer the world ♫ So I'm coming your way ♫ Keep an eye on my sleigh ♫ Because ♫ I want the world to know there's a Mrs. Santa Claus ♫ So I'm coming your way ♫ Keep an eye on my sleigh ♫ Because ♫ You'll have a Merry Christmas with ♫ Mrs. ♫ Santa ♫ Claus (reindeer moaning) Just a little heavy weather.

(reindeer grumbling) It was a bit unexpected, wasn't it? (bells chiming) It's all right, everything is going to be fine. That's a good boy, Prancer. You're a very good boy. (reindeer moaning) What is it, darling? Oh, Cupid. Well, we're all safe and sound, aren't we? Oh, you've hurt your poor leg. (men chattering) (Marcello vocalizing) Lovely singing. (speaking foreign language) Good morning. I wonder if you could help me, dear. You see, I had a little mishap with my-- - Horse? - Not exactly. Come along, Cupid dear. (Cupid moaning) Yes. - [Marcello] It's a reindeer. - Yes, a reindeer. - Oh for a Christmas pageant. - Yes, a Christmas pageant (chuckles). Quite a big one. We do it every year. - Oh. - Is he very badly hurt? - Hey. It's not broken, senora, but he will need a rest. You leave him here with me? - Oh, I'd be so grateful. How soon will he be able to fly? Uh, that is, how long will it be before the poor darling is all healed? - One week he will be as good as new. - Oh goodness, one week? But, I absolutely have to be home by Christmas Eve at the very latest. - [Marcello] Nothing to worry, senora. I give him extra special care. - Oh, thank you very much. I am Marcello Damaroco. - I'm honored Marcello. - Where you come from Mrs. uh-- - I come from the North, uh, from the North. Ah, Senora de North. - Well, actually, yes, I'm Mrs. North. Marcello, I don't suppose you have room for a few more? - More? - Well, it would be a very sorry Christmas pageant with only one reindeer. Come along, dears. This is the one we call Blitzen. (reindeer groaning) Comet. And, Prancer and Vixen, of course. - No more, please, senora. - Oh, just Dasher and Donder and Dancer. I realize that eight is a lot. But, they won't be any bother. I mean, they could double up. - Well we better get them some breakfast, no? Where are you staying, Mrs. North? - Oh, I hadn't given it a thought. Any old place to unbutton my boots will do you know. - Come, I take you to the best boarding house in all of New York City. Right down here on Avenue A.

Ah, Mr. Kilkenny, one of my finest boarders. - Good morning, ma'am. If you don't mind, I have to go catch the trolley. Now, goodbye, Nora. And, make sure no trouble today. - I'll be good, Da. - All right. - Sadie, help our new guest to the house. Enough with the women's suffering. - Women's suffrage, Mama. One man, one vote. The law says nothing about women. - (chuckles) Excuse my daughter. She's a little excitable. - Oh, but she does have a point. - Why thank you. - I'd like you to meet your greatest admirer, Sadie. This is Marcello Damoroco. - An honor, signorina. I come to listen to you every day. - To my speeches? - To you is speech, signorina, to me is a song. If I could, I would give my vote to you.

Well, I know a ladies emporium. Gorgeous second-hand clothes, on credit yet. (women giggling) - Well don't tell me that you made this! - For my fancy customer, from uptown. Let me. - Oh thank you. - Dinner, I serve at 6:00. Extra five cents a day should you want. - Oh thank you, I want. (light knocking) - Excuse me. - Where's that little hellion, Nora Kilkenny? Is her father at home? - No, no, not here. On the trolley car he's working. Day and night. - Well, you tell him for me that his little hooligan has been raising holy hellfire. Excuse the language, missus and missus. - I'll tell him sir, officer, Your Honor, sir. - Oh, Mrs. Lowenstein, you're shaking. - I think he's coming to take away Sadie.

(women giggling) (Nora coughing) - Officer Doyle. - Oh, Mrs. Lowenstein. Well, hello. - Hello. - Well, you darling girl. You found the eggs that Mrs. Lowenstein was looking for. - I seen you, you little brat. By God, I have you now. - Oh cripes, Doyle! - In here. (loud knocking) - Uh, where is she? The girl? - Oh, did I hear little footsteps going out the back way? - Thanks very much, missus.

Mmm, and where is your mother? - She's back in Ireland. My old man's working double shifts to pay for a steamship ticket to bring her and my baby brother over. - So, your mother is in Ireland and your father is working all the time. - Hey, I pull my own weight. I got me a job over at Tavish's. - You have a job? - Well, why shouldn't I? Don't you? - At the moment, no. Uh, but I do need one. - All right, you did for me so I'll do for you, kiddo. - Kiddo? - That's New York talk. - Oh. - I don't suppose you'd know anything about making toys? - Oh.

Workers. (cane tapping) Allow me to present Mrs. North, your new supervisor. Welcome, welcome to the wonderful world of Tavish Toys. We're so lucky to have found someone with Mrs. North's experience and on such short notice. - Uh, yes. Well, it certainly looks as if I'll have to roll up my sleeves a bit. - (chuckles) Well, I shall leave you to your own devices. Just keep in mind, time is of the essence, tick, tock. - Well, I'm certainly used to the Christmas rush. - [Tavish] Outstanding. - Now, my little elves, I do not want a repeat of what happened to the last supervisor, hmm? (laughs) - Well, hello. You're awfully small to be using such a big broom. - That's Emilio. He don't talk. He's new in America. - I know just how he feels. Now, if I might ask, what happened to the other supervisor? I was told that he was taken ill. - Yeah, he tripped over something. - Yeah, your foot. (children laughing) - Hey, Mrs. North is all right. She's my friend. - If she's your friend, tell her to get us some heat. - Yes, it is a bit frosty in here, isn't it? There must be some kind of malfunction with the stove. - [Child] Yeah, it don't function till Tavish puts some coal in it. - Well, I'll have to speak to Mr. Tavish about that, won't I? I've always felt that a happy workshop is a productive workshop. Don't you agree? - Have you ever worked in a factory before, lady? - [Girl] Tell her, Fritzie, tell her. - Well, it so happens that we're in the toy business ourselves back home. - Get her. What's an old lady know about toys? (children laughing) - Old lady?

Grateful, happy workers. - Yes, but, there are some problems, Mr. Tavish. I mean, the heat, for instance. - Heat? I don't feel any heat, do you? - Oh, and there's a matter of quality. Mr. Tavish, have you ever seen how a child plays with a teddy bear? - What's your point, Mrs. North? - Well, give this bear a hug and you'll see what I mean. - Um, no. - Oh just a little hug. - Get that bear away from me. - Well then, I'll show you myself. This is how a child hugs a teddy bear, Mr. Tavish. There, you see what I mean? I mean, what's needed here is thicker cloth for the fur. And, good, strong thread. - You worry too much, Mrs. North. You look at the bear and see the flaws. I look at it and see the happiness it brings. - Oh, but I don't think that defective toy makes any child happy, Mr. Tavish. - I was referring to the happiness it brings to me. The more we make, the more we sell, the happier I am. Tick, tock, Mrs. North, tick, tock. - Mr. Tavish, if you've ever see a child's face when a toy breaks. - Workers, what's our motto? - [Children] It only has to last till Christmas. - Oh, but Mr. Tavish. The children's hands are shaking with the cold. Can't anything be done? - Of course something can be done, Mrs. North. Mittens. - But, Mr. Tavish, Mr. Tavish, sir. Auggie Tavish. Children, the conditions in here are intolerable. - So, what are you gonna do about it? - Well, I haven't decided just yet, but when I do, I do know that we all have to stick together. What do you say? (children cheering) ♫ So let them say you passed my peak ♫ That you're a million years from hide-and-seek ♫ But when my dirge is sung ♫ You'll still be tough as a riddle and fit as a fiddle ♫ And struttin' and kickin' like some little chicken ♫ And almost young (children cheering) (delicate music) - Here we go. Piping hot. - Thank you, Arvo. Rrruck! My wife made this cocoa? - Uh (chuckles) looks like nice is beating naughty 'bout 100 to one this year. - Arvo, I asked you a question. Who made the cocoa? - I made the cocoa. I'm a supervisor. I'm not a cocoa elf. - Why didn't Mrs. Claus make it? Arvo, I repeat, why didn't Mrs. Claus make it? - Uh, Mrs. Claus isn't here, chief. - Isn't here? That's impossible. Where would she be? - Uh, well, she said to uh, tell you, that she's taking a little trip. Around the world. - Arvo, why didn't she tell me? I would've stopped her. - Maybe that's what she didn't tell you. - Well, why didn't you tell me, Arvo? - I've been expecting her back any minute now and I didn't want you to worry. Besides, you didn't even notice she was gone. - Well I wa... Well certainly I... Well she hasn't been gone-- - Two days. - That's not possible. Surely I would've... - Look, if you had taken notice of her now and then, maybe she wouldn't have left. - Where on Earth can she be? In a few days it'll be Christmas. - Well, if she's not back soon, we may not even have Christmas. She took the reindeer. - Can't bear to think of her out there, somewhere, helpless and alone. - [Santa] Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas. Thank you, young man. - A very worthy cause, dear. But, the boots aren't quite right. (lively music) (trolley bell ringing) Good morning, Mr. Kilkenny. - It is time for change. We have the right to demand the vote. Look at Susan B. Anthony. Look how one woman has taken up-- (speaking foreign language) Oh, nice and crunchy (giggles). Just like the boys like them. I wonder, would you be a dear and send over eight bunches of these to the Delancey stables? And, some of these lovely apples, too. I think 20 pounds should do it. And, tell Marcello that Mrs. North sent them. He'll know what to do. - [Man] Marcello, Delancey Stables. - Mrs. North. (speaking foreign language) - The workers were not afraid to speak up for their rights. And, when the bosses wouldn't give him a better wage, the workers demanded it. And, the right to vote will not be granted until women demand it. - I demand some hot water. Why don't you holler on my landlord, Sadie? - Who will march with me to Union Square? It's hopeless. All these women care about is the price of pushcart onions. - I know. You know, Sadie, I'm in a bit of a predicament and I think you might be just the person to help me. - [Sadie] Really? - Now, try to imagine a group of workers in a factory, let's say. Now, how might they improve their working conditions? Keeping in mind that the boss is a rather difficult man. Not inclined to give in to demands, if you know what I mean. - And, that's all you have to do. - It's really that simple? - Oh, it's been successful in factories all over the country. I wish the other women around here would listen to me the way you do. I promised I'd... - You're a good influence, Mrs. North, keeping my Sadie out of trouble. (chuckles) - I promised that I'd bring a whole contingent from Avenue A to the rally tomorrow. Instead, I'm just bringing a soapbox. - Well, if you wouldn't mind a little advice from a Johnny-come-lately like me? - No, please. I so admire your fervor, Sadie. But, I don't believe anyone likes to be shouted at. - Well, I shout so my message can be heard. - Perhaps if you try talking to these ladies without your soapbox. - Good afternoon, Mrs. Shaughnessy. - Well, if it isn't Soapbox Sadie. I'll have none of your blarney now. Good day to you, Mrs. North. - And, to you, Mrs. Shaughnessy. You know, Sadie was just telling me how you came all the way over here from Ireland when you were just a girl. - My own mother brought 10 of us over from Dublin. - Oh, did you say Dublin, on the River Liffey. - Bless my soul. You know Dublin, Mrs. North? - Well, I'm very keen on geography. - Now, Mrs. Shaughnessy, there must've been some who told your mother to stay put. - Oh well, there were many that tried. But, you don't know my mother. - But, are you very many of the women like her? You for example. - That's why we're asking you to stand strong, Mrs. Shaughnessy. - Just like your mother. - And, march with us. - [Mrs. Claus And Sadie] For a woman's right to vote. (stick thudding) - Mr. Brandenheim makes all the decisions. What do I need the vote for? - But, Mrs. Brandenheim, you yourself make 100 decisions every day. Don't you decide what you make for dinner? - Yah, I do that. - And, don't you decide how much coal to buy? - Yah, I do that. - And, how many nickels to put in the cookie jar? - Yah, I do that too. - So, shouldn't you decide who gets elected? - Yah! Oh, all this deciding. It wears me out. - [Sadie] Oh well, I guess it's only the two of us after all. - Still I'm proud to march with you, Sadie. ♫ I'm Mrs. Shaughnessy and I'm marching with you ♫ I'm Mrs. Brandenheim and I'm joining you too. ♫ It's time to stand up, step out, and be counted ♫ And then ♫ How about tying an apron on all of the men - Vote for women! ♫ Now, Mr. Brandenheim thinks how clever he is ♫ But, this old girl has a brain that's equal to his ♫ So, remember our call ♫ A line that you all can quote ♫ It's time for every miss and missus to have a vote - But, beyond the vote.

And, you know what, Nora? - [Nora] What? - That's what's going to happen at Tavish Toys. Now Sadie was telling me about something called a work slowdown. I think it just might do the trick. - [Nora] We'll get heat? - Only if we stick together, Sadie set. - I'm with you, Mrs. North. - Oh Marcello, thank goodness. I'm on pins and needles about getting home. Tell me, how is Cupid? - What are you doing here, Marcello? - I want for you having a vote, signorina and all that your heart desires. - [Santa] Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho. - We mustn't catch cold, must we dear. - Thank you. - Wait for me. I'm coming.

There's a sweetheart. (reindeer grunting) I know, I know, Christmas Eve is fast approaching. Only three days until. - There she is. Brava, Sadie. - Mazel tov, Sadie, mazel tov. - Thank you. - No, you're gonna run for president now? - Or even mayor of New York? - Signorina. Scusa. Sadie, one moment, please. - I'm very busy now, Marcello. I've got to shop for my mother and get home. - Yes, Christmas Eve, the policemen they make a big party for the neighborhood, everybody come. I was wondering dearest Sadie, if you would, if you would be there too? - I have more on my mind than parties. - Yes, but you dance as well as you march. - Look Marcello... ♫ A girl with a drive and a fellow with a dream ♫ Are like pickled herring with vanilla ice cream ♫ So, as unromantic as my words may seem ♫ We don't go together at all ♫ My big loud mouth and your quiet ways ♫ Are like August evenings with December days ♫ Are like corned beef and cabbage topped with mayonnaise ♫ We don't go together at all ♫ We're like chicken soup ♫ And a slice of ham ♫ We're the big bad wolf ♫ And the little lamb ♫ Like a picnic lunch ♫ That's ruined by a sudden squall ♫ We don't, no we don't ♫ No we don't go together at all ♫ Like an overcoat ♫ And a hot July ♫ Like a bowl of borscht ♫ And a pizza pie ♫ Like if I asked you ♫ To come to the policemen's ball ♫ We don't, no we don't ♫ No we don't go together at all ♫ An onion roll at a Mayfair tea ♫ Like a march by Sousa in a minor key ♫ So forget all the magic that was meant to be ♫ We don't go together at all ♫ A stable boy and a suffragette ♫ Are about as peculiar as a pair can get ♫ So it's, oh, such a pity ♫ That we even met ♫ We don't go together at all ♫ But, I like your spunk ♫ And I like your pride ♫ So I'll still be there ♫ Marching at your side ♫ So, I guess, my friend ♫ We must admit the simple fact ♫ That opposites ♫ Oh yes opposites ♫ Attract - But Da, I haven't even told you about the rally after Sadie's speech or nothing. - I'll hear about it some other time. Bye child. (sighs) You know I'd like to stay with you, Princess. But, if I'm late, I'll be docked for sure. (mouth clicking) Mrs. North, evening. - Good evening. Looks like it's just the two of us tonight. All that walking, all of us gathered there in the square. It was exhilarating, wasn't it? - I've never seen so many people in one place in all of my life. - I was just thinking how much my husband would've enjoyed it. He so loves high spirits. - My mother too. - Well, there will certainly be many more good times after your mother comes over from Ireland. - Yeah. Ah, who am I kidding? I'll never see her again. - Oh, of course you will, Nora. - It's been over a year. She probably won't even recognize me. - You remember what she looks like, don't you? - Of course. She has red hair, sorta brown red, like a penny. Like mine. (somber music) And, she has freckles on her arms and on her cheeks. And, two right up under her eye. She probably looks different now anyway. - She misses you just as much as you miss her. She thinks about you just as often, maybe even more. - Yeah? - Can you keep a secret, Nora? I'm missing someone too. Someone who's also very far away. And, when I'm missing someone as I am right now, you know what I do? Well... I look up at the night sky and find our special star. And, with every twinkle, I know that the one I love is thinking of me. - You think my mother's thinking of me right now too? - I know she is, kiddo. - Oh, Mrs. North, look. Ever seen the Vaudeville show? - No, but shall we buy a ticket? - Are you kidding? It costs two bits. - Oh. - Come on. (lively music) (crowd chattering) Oh, aren't they something? - Oh, I must say, they're a rare talent. (audience applauding) (audience cheering) - Oh, Maud and Claude. I'm seen 'em a million times! (Claude whistling) - Come on, Nora. Out you go. Before I gotta start charging you. - Oh, just another minute, Sean. My friend ain't seen it before. (Claude whistling) - Aye, you've got moxie, Nora, I'll give you that. But, I don't wanna lose my job. - All right, we're going. Don't bust your suspenders. - Thank you very much, Sean. (Claude whistling) (audience applauding) - [Man] And, that's the last time. Good night! (door slamming) - Hey, look it. Will you look at all this stuff. (Sadie whistling) ♫ Whistle (Sadie whistling) ♫ When you feel that no one is near (Sadie whistling) ♫ Whistle (Sadie whistling) ♫ And you'll find me standing right here (Sadie whistling) ♫ Here to help smooth out the wrinkles ♫ Here to make loneliness end ♫ It'll do you a lot of good ♫ Knowing you've got a good friend ♫ And all you have to do is whistle (Sadie whistling) ♫ And you'll find me holding your hand (Sadie whistling) ♫ When life ♫ Doesn't go the way that you planned (Sadie whistling) ♫ Whatever rut you get stuck in ♫ You'll feel me pulling you through ♫ And then and forevermore ♫ You'll hear me whistling for you ♫ Whistle ♫ When you feel that no one is near ♫ Whistle ♫ And you'll find me standing right here ♫ Here to help smooth out the wrinkles ♫ Here to make loneliness end ♫ It'll do you a lot of good ♫ Knowing you've got a good friend ♫ Whatever rut you get stuck in ♫ You'll feel me pulling you through ♫ And then and forevermore ♫ You'll hear me whistling for (throat clearing) (Sadie whistling) (Mrs. Claus whistling) (both whistling) ♫ And, all you have to do is whistle ♫ And, you'll find me holding your hand ♫ When life ♫ Doesn't go the way that you planned ♫ Whatever rut you get stuck in ♫ You'll feel me pulling you through ♫ And then and forevermore ♫ You'll hear me whistling for ♫ You (both whistling) (crowd applauding) - [Woman] They're good! - Hold up. Now, just where do you think you're going with that tree? - We ain't stealing it, I swear. - Oh. - We're just taking it over to Tavish's. - [Girl] Nobody else wanted it. - [Boy] It's ours free and clear. - Oh it is, is it? Well, we'll have to see about that. And, in the meantime, I'll be taking it, thank you. - I beg your pardon, officer, but these are very hard-working children. And, if they say that they have not stolen that tree, then I believe them. - Oh, I see. So, they have you fooled now as well, have they? - Listen here, Doyle-- - Uh, Nora. - Officer Doyle. Look, I promise I ain't gonna kick you no more, okay? Okay, I ain't gonna throw no more eggs at you either. So, can we have the lousy tree? - Well, it is a bit of a scrawny old thing, isn't it? Take it. - Thank you, officer. - Mrs. North, I was wondering, ma'am, seeing as you take to the children so, maybe you'd be interested in buying a ticket for the policemen's benefit. It'll be on over in Foley's Saloon. And besides, we can't have you spending Christmas Eve by yourself, can we? - Well, it wouldn't be the fist time. But, it sounds lovely. And, I'll take two tickets. - Okay. That'll be 50 cents, ma'am. - And, there's something that you could do for me, officer. - Ma'am? - You see the second ticket is for my landlady, Mrs. Lowenstein, and I'd very much like you to deliver her ticket to her personally. - Me? Oh, I don't think herself wants much to do with me, ma'am. - I wonder if she might not be a little bit afraid of you. - Afraid of me? Oh. Well, I wish to God some of it'd rub of on that one. - I told you, Doyle, I reformed. - Oh yes. I'll believe that when I see it. Well, I'll do that for you, ma'am. Good night to you now. - Mrs. North, come on. I was just telling the kids about your idea for tomorrow. - Yes, well Sadie gave me the notion. Tomorrow, we all work as slowly as we possibly can. - It'll drive Tavish crazy. So, that's the plan okay? Tomorrow, slow as molasses. Everybody got it? - [Children] Got it. - But, what if Tavish gets mad? - What if we get scared? ♫ Then all you have to do is whistle ♫ And you'll find me holding your hand ♫ When life ♫ Doesn't go the way that you planned ♫ Whistle ♫ When you feel that no one is near (children whistling) (somber music) (Santa sighs) (loud knocking) - Chief? - Come in. - Surprise! (lively music) - Okay fellas, bad idea. Well, we'll be leaving now. I said we'll be leaving now. Goodbye. Merry Christmas. - [Girl] We're going, we're going. (speaking foreign language) Okay! Gee whiz. - Not even one little ho, ho, ho? - Ho. (bells jingling) - Look chief, she's gonna be back. - We've been together from the very beginning. Without her I feel like, I feel like there's no such thing as Santa Claus. If only I'd taken the time to tell her what she means to me. - Why don't you tell her now? - Now? - Millions of children write letters to you every year. Maybe it's time for Santa to write one. - We don't even know where she is. - Maybe just getting the words on paper would help. It's just a thought. (somber flute music) ♫ Dear Mrs. Santa Claus ♫ Wherever you are ♫ I'm without you as lost ♫ As some little star ♫ You're not there when I call ♫ And, so everything's all askew ♫ So I guess little wife ♫ That the joy in my life is you ♫ Dear Mrs. Santa Claus ♫ How I hope you can see ♫ From now on ♫ What a drastic change there will be ♫ So, I wish on the moon ♫ You'll come home to me soon ♫ Because ♫ You'll never know how Santa ♫ Misses Mrs. Claus (bells chiming) (horse hooves clomping) - My fancy customer from uptown. So, now she decides she don't want red after all. Hmm! (loud knocking) - Oh, Sadie. I was wondering is your mother in? Oh, Mrs. Lowenstein. - Officer, Your Honor. She's a good girl. She didn't mean to start nothing. - Well, from what I've been told, she started plenty. - Oh no! - Sure did my own mother go up there to Union Square to hear them all cheering for your Sadie. (chuckles) She's a regular Susan MacAnthony, that one. - See Mama. - Oh, and by the way, Mrs. L, somebody bought you a ticket for our precinct Christmas party. It'll be on over in Foley's Saloon, so it will. - Who is this does such a thing? - Well, let's just say it's your own Secret Santa. And, it'd be giving myself and to the lads at the precinct much pleasure if our favorite hostess could attend. - Me, you're talking about? - Sure, who else? So, we'll be seeing you Christmas Eve then? Good day to you both. (slow music) - No, my dumplings, I think a proper slowdown would be even slower. Slowly. Oh that's perfect, Emilio. Fine. - You think this is really gonna work? - It's better than do nothing and freezing. - But, we've got to stick together like glue, Fritzie. It's only when the wheels turn together that the train can move. (train clattering) Oh. - And, how are my little elves today? What, may I ask, is happening here? Busiest week of the busiest season and I see four, five, six trains. Three teddy bears. Mrs. North, I demand an explanation at once. (cane clacking) - I believe that it's the cold air that is slowing up down, Mr. Tavish. Perhaps some coal on the fire would pick up the pace. - I'm on to you, Mrs. North. This little slowdown is your handiwork, isn't it? - Oh, not just mine, it's all of us together. - [Children] Yeah, that's right, together, yeah. - Well then, it's my pleasure to inform all of you together that you'll be spending Christmas Day right here! - [Children] No! - Oh now just a moment, Mr. Tavish. What possible use could all the children be to you on Christmas? I mean, all of the toys will have been delivered. - Clean up, Mrs. North. A good scrubbing down of all the walls and floors. - [Children] No! - Now children, remember, stick together like the wheels on a train. (children chattering) - I will let you off an hour early for Christmas if you tell me did Mrs. North put you up to this? - Yeah, she's the brains behind the whole thing. - She made us do it. - [Boy] It was her. - Then she took Christmas away from you, didn't she? Shall I let her go? - [Children] Yes! - Find you a new supervisor? - [Children] Yes! - There you have it, Mrs. North, democracy in action. Now, get out! - [Man] Careful with those. - [Man] Okay watch it. - Nora, I am so sorry. - It's not your fault. To tell you the truth, I wouldn't have minded working on Christmas. I hate Christmas anyway. - Oh Nora, you can't mean that. - I'm afraid I do. (dog barking) Without my mother here, it's just another day of the week. - Well, I know just what you mean, but Christmas or not, people shouldn't have to work under those conditions. - Well, we tried. - Well, thank you for standing up for me with Mr. Tavish. That took moxie. - Well, I guess I better start looking for another job or we'll never have enough to bring my mother and my brother over. - When I think of those poor children working so hard, their little fingers turning to icicles. Nora, there must be something that we can do. ♫ Whatever rut you get stuck in ♫ You'll feel me pulling you through ♫ And then and forevermore more ♫ You'll hear me whistling for you (whistling) (laughing) (dynamic music) (lively music) - Always wanted to do that. Mmm, Auggie Tavish. Right, sweetheart, the coast is clear. - Hey, how'd you do that? - Oh, little trick my husband taught me. - Anybody see ya? - Not yet. - We should've stuck with Mrs. North. - Then we'd be out of our jobs. - Yeah, but at least we wouldn't be freezing. - Ah, quit your bellyaching. The slowdown didn't work. And it didn't work because-- It didn't work because we didn't believe in ourselves enough. - [Boy] Mrs. North. - [Girl] What are you doing here? - You better not let Tavish find you. - Tavis don't scare us, does he, Mrs. North? - The only way we'll succeed with Tavish, is if you children stick together. - Not that again. - Well, not just the children in here, but all of the children in the entire city. What if you told every boy and girl in New York that Tavish Toys fall apart the day after Christmas? What if everyone knew that little children suffered to make them. I'm talking about a strike, a boycott, citywide. And I want to know who's with me. - Mr. Tavish ain't gonna like that. - He'll just fire us and hire other kids. - Oh, not when they find out how shabbily you children have been treated. - Nobody cares about kids from Avenue A. - Well, I care, Henry, and I care very much. And, I know that others will too. But, we've got to tell them. Now, who will join me? - I will! - Big surprise. - And, what about the rest of you? Will one more join in? Will someone else say strike? Who will help get Tavish Toys off the shelves? - Strike! - He talks! - If Emilio's in, I'm in too. And I say strike. - Me too. - Hey, move over, you aren't in before me. Strike. - [Children] Strike! Strike, strike, strike, strike, strike, strike, strike. - [Nora] Take Tavish Toys off the shelves. Don't buy Tavish Toys. - [Children] Strike, strike, strike. (lively music) (neighbors shouting) - Thank you very much. - Sorry, lady! - Here are some Tavish Toys for you. - [Child] Oh, thank you. (lively music) - [Nora] Take Tavish Toys off the shelves. Tavish Toys aren't built to last. - You know, darling, I may have underestimated the difficulty of your job. - [Nora] Tavish toys are defective. - [Mayor] As mayor, I pledge that no child will ever again work under deplorable conditions like those of the Tavish Toy Company. - [Photographer] Over here, Mr. Mayor. (crowd applauding) Right here, please. (flash powder exploding) - [Paperboy] Extra, extra. Children's crusade closes down Tavish Toys. Read all about it. Extra, extra. (dramatic music) - Mrs. North! (shouting) (toys clattering) - There's an outcry for child labor laws all over New York. Thanks to you, Mrs. North. - Oh, you were the inspiration, Sadie. - Another picture of your father, may he rest in peace. And, my grandmother's candlesticks. Look, Sadie. Only one candlestick now. The other was lost. - It's beautiful. - So, Mama, tell me, you're unpacking your bag. Does this mean we'll be staying here awhile? - What? You don't like America? (chuckles) You got someplace better to go? Oh, my mother's broach. I think I'll wear it to the policemen's party tonight. - You're going to the Christmas party, Mama? - I got a ticket, so why shouldn't I go? You're coming, Mrs. North? - Oh, I wouldn't miss it (chuckles). - And, this is what you're wearing? - Hmm? (sighs) (crowd chattering) (upbeat music) - Ah, Mrs. North, I have good news. Eh, Cupid, his leg is all fixed. - (sighs) Oh, thank you, Marcello. Thank you. (crowd applauding) - Everyone, may I have your attention, please? May I, please? Thank you. I know it may seem unusual, a Jewish girl making a Christmas toast. (crowd chattering) But, as most of you know, I have the biggest mouth on Avenue A. (crowd lauding) - Oh no. - I'd like to thank someone we've only known a very short while, but who has already given so much to me and especially to the children. Mrs. North, you've been our good luck charm. Come to think of it, what you've really been is our Santa Claus. - Mrs. Santa Claus. - Right (chuckles). Here's to the Mrs. Santa Claus of Avenue A. (crowd applauding) - Brava, brava. Brava. (slow dance music) - [Boy] May I have this dance? (horse hooves clomping) - Nicky? - It's only me. Officer Doyle, Mrs. North. What are you doing up there in the cold all by yourself? - Oh, I was just looking for a star. - Good night to you now. And, Merry Christmas. (tinkling music) ♫ Every time a star is falling ♫ Someone that you love is calling ♫ He needs me ♫ Yes, he needs me ♫ Don't even ask me how I know ♫ I know ♫ When he calls me ♫ My heart hears him ♫ And tells me that it's time ♫ For me to go ♫ He's my world ♫ And I am his ♫ He's my world ♫ And journey's end ♫ Is where he is ♫ And his laughter ♫ Is my laughter ♫ And tells me what I'm living for ♫ And so, if he needs me ♫ I'll go ♫ 'Cause I need him ♫ Much more I have to leave now, sweetheart. - All right, I'll see you tomorrow. - Well, I'm afraid not. You see, I'm needed back home. - But you can't go, not yet. - I'm afraid I have to. But, I haven't forgotten about the Christmas presents for you and for the others. - Am I ever going to see you again? - Oh, I hope so. But, until then, remember, just look up at the night sky and you'll know when I'm thinking about you. ♫ He's my world ♫ And I am his ♫ He's my world ♫ And journey's end is where he is ♫ And his laughter ♫ Is my laughter ♫ And tells me what I'm living for ♫ And so, if he needs me ♫ I'll go ♫ 'Cause I need him ♫ Much more Cupid? (horse whinnying) Comet? Donder? Where are you boys? (horse whinnying) Oh. (ominous music) - Missing something, Mrs. North? Or should I say, Mrs. Claus? - Oh, how did you know? - Oh, I've had my suspicions all along. First, there was your knowledge of toy-making. And, then the name, Mrs. North, as in North Pole. Nice touch. And, when I realized you'd come down the chimney, (chuckles) well! - (sighs) Mr. Tavish, without the reindeer the children won't be able to receive their toys. (horse whinnying) - Pity. - But, you'll be ruining Christmas. - Precisely. By morning, all of New York will come crawling back to Augustus P. Tavish. - Of course. Poor little Auggie Tavish. You wrote to Santa asking for a stuffed bear back in 1872, was it? And, Santa brought you the most beautiful bear. It had a vest with a satin lining. But, then you never wrote to him again. - You mean, Santa noticed that? - Oh, he mentioned it several times. - Well, you see, my step brother, he stole my bear on Christmas Day. - And, you loved it so. And, you thought you'd never have another one like it. - Yes, that's right. - So, you wanted to ruin every child's Christmas just the way yours had been ruined. - Yes, it's true. I can't deny. - Well, Auggie, you don't have to destroy anyone's Christmas ever again. Here, dear. Just like the one you lost, right down to the satin vest. And, remember, it's not the gift itself that matters. It's the love behind it. - Thank you. - Would you take me to my reindeer now? - Of course. And, tell Santa I said hello. - Of course (chuckles). - Oh! Christmas Eve and the worst night of my life. - Ah, there's still time. You have to believe. - Hello. Whoa, boys. (upbeat music) So sorry I'm late. - If only you'd known how worried I've been. - Oh, did you miss me, Nick? - More than you could ever know. Where in the world have you been? - Oh, you better hurry, kiddo. - Kiddo? - Oh, that's New York talk. I'll tell you about it tomorrow. Tonight, the children are waiting for you. Here, here. Mustn't catch cold, must we. Now, off you go. I'll be here tomorrow morning just like I always am. - Anna, close your eyes. And keep them closed. - [Elf] Excuse me, Mrs. Claus. - Who is that? What are you doing with my... Arvo, what are you doing? - Earrings. - [Mrs. Claus] What is all this? - I have a surprise for you. But first, you're going to have to put on something warm. Open your eyes now. - Oh, Nick, Nick, it's beautiful. (dramatic music) - This year, Anna, come with me. - Oh, don't be silly. - And, this year, I want to use your new map. - You are? - Step lively, Mrs. Claus, children are waiting. - Well, when you put it that way. (laughs) (reindeer groaning) (elves chattering) - [Santa] Oh, so sorry, Anna. - Oh, this is so exciting (giggles). (laughing) - All right, then. On Dasher. Come on, Anna, you must know this by now. - On Dancer. - On Prancer. - On Vixen. - On Comet. - Oh, how awful, I forget who's next. - Cupid. - Oh how silly. How could I have forgotten Cupid (chuckles). - On Cupid. - [Both] On Donder and Blitzen. (both laughing) (bells jingling) - [Santa] Merry Christmas, Anna. - [Mrs. Claus] Merry Christmas, Nicky. ♫ Through a navy blue night ♫ Crowned with shimmering stars ♫ To the kids of the world I'll be paying my annual call ♫ But, now that you're sitting ♫ Beside me ♫ We'll have the best Christmas of all ♫ Flying over the clouds ♫ Floating under the moon ♫ As we watch and we wait ♫ For the first chimney top to appear ♫ But, now that you're sitting ♫ Beside me ♫ We'll have the best, Happy New Year ♫ Though the wind may be strong ♫ I will never complain dear ♫ I'm happy as long ♫ As there's you and my reindeer ♫ Through a navy blue night ♫ Crowned with shimmering stars ♫ In a moment I know ♫ That the first little snowflake will fall ♫ But, now that you're sitting ♫ Beside me ♫ We'll have the best Christmas of all ♫ Though the frost in the air ♫ Means a change in the weather ♫ But, what do we care ♫ When we're flying together (both laughing) - Oh look, we're coming up on New York City. - [Mrs. Claus] I know, Nicky. - Nora, come.
