Maxim Gorkii Central Film Studio (Children and Youth Films) LET'S LIVE TILL MONDAY Scriptwriter G. Polonsky Directed by S. Rostotsky Camera V. Shumsky Art department B. Dulenkov Music K. Molchanov Sound department A. Izbutsky Song lyrics by Nikolai Zabolotsky THURSDAY Good morning, Ilya Semyonovich. - Hello. The broom, quick! Why is it croaking? - It's swearing Such feathers, such a lovely beak! It must be charming when you speak! How do you call this bird in English? A crow. Crow, crow, crow! Cherevichkina, give us your sandwich! Get lost! Don't be a cheapskate. Enough! It's a living being You mustn't treat it like that. Where are you going? Take the broom away. Rita, take the broom away. Take your places. Kostya, wait, sit down Sit down everybody. Quiet. Quiet, everyone - Something is coming... - You reckon? They'll be ranting and raving, nothing more. Where did the crow come from? - You should have noticed. You're a bureau member. They will hold you responsible. So what? - So nothing. Just when this thing is investigated by the higher authority You can tell them that it was me who brought the crow. For a different reason though. You? - Yep. It's very nice of you, actually. I've been staving it off but the day of reckoning was coming. I've been neglecting English. My crow is a clever bird. It took care of it. You should be going. Your bodyguard will worry. - Because of you?! Quiet, children, please. You're not helping. Natalya Sergeyevna. - Wait, Shestopalov. Come here, come, come. I'll give you some bread. Some wheat bread, and rye bread. Come, come, come. Come here, come. I was teaching a lesson, and suddenly it flew... I did not enquire who'd brought it. Maybe it came on her own? - Sure it did. To get warm. It's cold out there. Is it true that he used to be your teacher? Ilya Semyonovich Why are you like that? Okay, I made a mistake, but you could help. How? If you need their love, well, they're crazy about you. And you don't need love anymore? Love's an evil. Don't let them push you around. Keep your distance, to not be sorry later. I can't help you. Never tried to catch crows. Gotcha! - Well done. Congratulations! The only crow trainer in the world, the show's sold out. An only performance today, leave tomorrow, hurry everyone. Silence! Take your places. Take your place. If you wish. Silence! Mommy told me it's very bad to kill birdies. No trial, no record. It's high, Natalya Sergeyevna, and it's all wrapped up. Why did you do that? The boys have captured it. Stop talking. Silence, please. The memorial service may now start. The deceased has sacrificed her life to the public education. Batischev, shut up! Maybe it's okay. I'll go have a look, okay? I can even bring it back. Dead or alive. Don't bring it here. Take it to Ilya Semyonovich. He should know the sacrifices made for him. Cherkasova, go out. Out! Guys, our teacher's been replaced. We had a great outgoing girl... Batischev, go out. Don't call me a girl. A woman then, sorry. And now a tyrant You'll debate it behind the door. Be quick. You'll end up alone. I'm not holding anyone. Oh, go on, go on. I enjoy listening to you. I just don't like the darkness. What was that you were playing? Lonely Wanderer, Grieg. Yes... few people understand good music. I always say, we shouldn't limit ourselves by our subjects. We should have a broader view, right? Then personal life of some would benefit, too. If you start thinking about it... If you start thinking, sure. By the way... Why aren't you heading home? You don't long to? - It's raining. Raining... Yes, sure. "It is raining in my town... ...it is raining day and night... ...and whatever I say you don't listen to me..." Don't get upset. You shouldn't. You shouldn't be playing the lonely pedestrian, either. Wanderer. A Lone Traveller Exactly. Nothing will happen to her. The board will forgive her. And you, first of all. Give me a cigarette. She's just a girl. She's only just started. You and I, we can't allow ourselves anything. Or forgive. What's the matter with you? Why have you changed so much? "We're overweak to guide our lives And in our youthful years The hurried vows we tender Do but amuse omniscient fate." So simply said, so calmly. And for all times. Any wonder! Classic Who? Sounds like Nekrasov. No? No way? Not Tyutchev? Still far Fet? Far. It's not from school curriculum. I'm giving up Baratynsky Ah well, you know... No one can remember all second-rate authors. Baratynsky! He's been transferred Where? To the first-rate list. Haven't you heard? You've become mean, indifferent and lonely. You've retreated into yourself nurturing your pessimism. You're an historian. It's not good, you know. Even politically. I'm now teaching history before 1917, Svetlana Mikhailovna. So it's okay, politically. Apparently, your mom's waiting. Apparently. Good-bye. Thanks. 5.80 for the sweets, please. 22 kopecks for bread, please. Ilya Semyonovich Rudnitsky, Borya! That's right. How do you do? How do you do, Boris? Still living and working at the same place? Yes. Borya, what's does this chauffeured vehicle mean? Our department treats its valued staff better than yours. I find it tragic that a man like you bides his time in a secondary school. You might be used with a higher ECE. - With what? ECE, energy conversion efficiency. - Oh. How are you? I'm fine, Ilya Semyonovich. No complaints. Married? Free. By the way, I heard that one our common acquaintance has settled in your school. How's she... Manages? Too early to say. She's got some problems. Everyone has. Yeah, she loves problems. She even creates them, additionally. Not just for herself - it's her choice. But for other people, too. Damn it, I'll tell you. Imagine a bride who at the doorstep of the registry office mumbles "I'm sorry", dumps the flowers and runs away. Noble. And honest. It's not just humiliated me, it's also disrupted my one-year business-trip to England. You know how they 'like' to send single men. But it's all for the best, of course. Do you know the song? "There's a place for everything in life, The good and the evil live nearby, If a bride leaves you for someone, It's a big question who's the lucky one." Maybe I'm wrong? You're right, Borya, you're right. Could you stop please? - It's not Arbat yet. I'll walk. I also need to go to a pharmacy. It's raining. Shall I wait for you? - No, thanks. You're right, that my efficiency could have been much higher. Good-bye Anyone called? - Oh yes Who? - Moviegoers Who? - Those who want to visit "Progress" cinema They were asking what's on and when. I was saying that the rain was on, all the time. What if they start asking for a bath-house? Or the Holy Synod? Poor you. At her 70 your mother's not dumb yet. The old hag wants to know the news - what a trouble! She's interested in her son's thoughts, and his work. One could talk to the old witch for half an hour, and it would last her a week, to think of the said. It's not theatre, mom, just everyday stuff. I don't know what to tell, honest. Did I tell you that Gorelova came to work with us? Who? Natasha Gorelova... of our graduates, six years ago. Do you remember? - Natasha Gorelova. Of course I remember. She had a romance with that one, what's his name... Your favourite. - Come on With Borya Rudnitski! Do you remember that? - Yes. Thanks, mom. What are you looking for? - Never mind... What is she teaching, then? English. - English... at your school. My loafers disrupted her lesson today. - Is she still in love with you? What are you talking about, mom? - Me? You used to tell me that she didn't let you teach. Staring at you with those eyes of hers... I don't remember. - Well, I knew it myself. Do you know how she wept in our kitchen, in my lap after the graduation, lamenting that you're so old. You got carried away, mom. Good night. - Good night What's on tonight? "Progress" cinema Really? How odd... Natalya Sergeyevna, Melnikov here. Sorry, stupid joke. I saw you leaving... in tears. You shouldn't, really. If every silly crow... Ah, you'll sort it out yourself. Okay, all right, all right. I'm sorry. FRIDAY If you can tell me, what kind of person - good morning... invites a boy for some music and dry wine? - Indeed. And why is it called "a birthday party"? My Valery comes, and there's just that girl, alone. - Well, they watch too many foreign movies. Music, dry wine... you shouldn't believe it. Your Valera's lying. She's the third one there, okay? Can you imagine, I wake up at 1 AM, not on my pillow. - Are you for real? It's so interesting, Klavdia Sergeyevna! - On copy-books, Igor Stepanovich. I see, I see. I've been marking them and fell asleep. It's hanging outside the window. Yes. As usual. At seven... yes. Allochka, have a heart. There are others, too. - Sure, sure. Good morning. - Good morning. - Hello. So what's happened, huh? Don't shrug. Is it okay if I call you by your first name? - Yes. It's your home now. You came of here, now you are back. So it's not polite to be aloof. I'm not aloof. That's good. What are you looking for, Raisa Pavlovna? - Protractor, the big wooden one. Behind the cabinet. Come on, I want to know your opinion. It's, you know, hair salon literature. - Really? - While you're waiting there... Every line belongs to a complacent, self-loving, indifferent author. Hello there. - Hello. - Hello. He can write this today and otherwise tomorrow. I don't believe him. - Strange. I liked it. Oh, Natasha dear, yours are older at least. But my, little ones, bring mirrors too, and just primp and preen. I'm telling them, 'Don't put no mirrors in your desks,' but them do it anyways. I say again, 'Don't put no mirrors,' but them do it. For God's sake, it's horrible. Yes, it's you I'm talking to. Are you a teacher or... You talking to me? Don't use double negatives, my dear Taisia Nikolayevna, where did you hear it? We're not in the marketplace! If you don't care about the kids, then at least spare our ears! Hello. Calm down, you shouldn't... Wait a second. What? - Please ask kids not to touch anything. My lab lesson was nearly ruined yesterday. - Why me? - Your class was before mine Well, Ilya Semyonovich? You see a mote in other people's eyes. The class you are responsible for did not come for the lesson. And there is not a single coat in the cloakroom. Congratulations! Please don't worry, I can do it myself. Whose lesson should they be at? Mine Look, Sanya! Ilya Semyonovich... Where are you going? Calm down! Hello. Good morning, Ilya Semyonovich. A strike, huh? A strike. What are your claims? - Ilya Semyonovich, we want Our human rights to be respected. Miss English should be called to order. She's rude. Yes, tell him, Batya... - Tell him, Kostya. Natalya Sergeyevna treated us very nicely at first. - And you disrupted her lesson for that. Let me say my thought to the end. Express your thought, you mean. I'm happy to listen, in the classroom. It's warmer there, of course. But we'll endure cold. We'll come... to the next lesson. Demidova, you're the class president. Why is Batischev giving orders? Because my willpower is weaker. Class president is working-class aristocracy. Okay, jokes are over. Enough. We're not joking. It's serious. - Serious, you say? Long time ago, the Russian society was shocked by the execution of revolutionaries Zhelyabov, Perovskaya, Kibalchich. Or pleas for help leaked from the prisoners of Oryol penal colony. They were being tortured. In such cases, the kids your age did not come for their classes. They called it a strike and a struggle for human rights. Just like Syromyatnikov. But hitting back a woman who's had a breakdown is not decent. Let's not prolong the bad things, like the ancients used to say. There you are! Look I'm sorry, guys, I was out of line. Come on, Natalya Sergeyevna, it's our fault. - It's our... Well, you are not blameless either. Behaved like pigs. - Correct, Natalya Sergeyevna... We're pigs. - I'm alone to blame. It's my crow. I brought it for a different reason, but it got away. Hm, I thought it was Syromyatnikov. No way, Natalya Sergeyevna, I'm all about cattle. Okay, kids... Close your books. What is the English for 'yekhat verkhom'? Syromyatnikov? - To ride - rode - ridden. Wonderful! Ah, there you are I'm sorry, Natalya Sergeyevna. I thought I should help to sort this out. What's up? Who are you boycotting? Sit down, sit. You knew that the vice-principal is on sick leave, that your teacher is young, and you used it? No secrets, please. No one is going to threaten you with administrative action. I just want to know what got into your heads? Whose idea it was? We've sorted it out already. Natalya Sergeyevna knows. Everything is fine now. Aha, I see. You have your own secrets and relations? Right. I won't be interfering, then. "Who cannot draw on three thousand years is living from hand to mouth." - J. W. von Goethe Come on, Yura, read that. Who cannot draw... - Okay, good, some more. on three tho.. thousand... Ilya Semyonovich, these are kids from class 1-A. Their teacher got suddenly sick and left. No one said what to do, so I'm showing them around your museum. Okay Who's your teacher? - Taisia Nikolayevna Essay (choice): 1. The character of Katerina in Ostrovsky's "The Thunderstorm" 2. Bazarov and Rakhmetov 3. My Idea of Happiness Is an epigraph necessary for "Happiness"? - It's desirable. Happiness is Cherkasova, enough. How long are going to look around for? Concentrate! Do you know why you can't write? Because your mind is in a haze. Who thinks clearly, expresses clearly. Don't worry, continue. What's happened, Ilya Semyonovich? - Nothing. Your face is... - What about it? It's not like you. For conspiracy's sake. A distance? Shall we keep it? You know better. I'm no longer your teacher, Natalya Sergeyevna. I see Where are our kids? They are writing an essay. My lesson has been taken for that. - Do you regret? Regret that not two. Come with me. Hello. - Hello. "My Idea of Happiness." She didn't offer us such topics. We usually wrote about typical representatives in literature. Such serious faces. Inspired. Syromyatnikov's cheating. Stealing someone's happiness. You'll see things like that every single day. You'll get sick of it. I don't understand how they can write about it. I couldn't. It's impossible to explain. Happiness... It's like trying to pin down a Sun ray. No rays. They'll write what is expected of them. Want to come in? I've got a lesson. - I'm free. Syromyatnikov Happiness, I think, is to be appreciated Do you realise what you've written? Nadya, my little darling, do you realise? I'm all for being sincere, that's why I offered this topic in the first place, but... Such dreams at your age? Just try to think of it! I thought that you... - What? I'm stupid, Svetlana Mikhailovna. I'm really stupid. It's sad, but it's better than being depraved. - What did you write, Nadya? What did you write? - It can't be read out loud. Why not? Maybe we're all writing something wrong, like her. Don't worry. You wouldn't think of anything like that. Continue working. - Give me back my essay. Here Take it and tear it up. I permit And try to write about Katerina. You may have enough time left. Write on. No. I'll read it. If you can know, we can too. Of course! Sure Shut up! - Why? Don't you understand? There are boys here! - Ha. So what? Give back your essay! - I won't! All right. Read it. You'll be ashamed of yourself. Go on, read! If we speak about happiness, it must be sincere. Not just rational. Many of us are shy to write about love, even though every girl is dreaming about it. Even the ugliest, who doesn't have any hope. I think one should always hope. I want to meet a man who would love children. Because without children, a woman cannot be really happy. If there is no war, I'd like to have two boys and two girls. Shush! Yes! Two boys and two girls! Then, all their lives, no one will feel lonely. The older will take care of little ones, and there will be happiness in the house. I did not write anything about work, but don't mothers have a lot of work? So, where is the problem? What's the problem, really? What's wrong about that? I can't believe it! - You shouldn't worry so much. She's going have children with her own husband, not someone else's. Enough! This class is the world's end. No shame, no modesty Hand your essays over! Happiness is to be appreciated! Me again. Hello Hi Come in Take a seat You shouldn't be coming, comrade Levikova, really. - I'm not just coming... I'm taking leave from work. You called him out again yesterday, didn't you? I did. You're busy? Sorry. Just two minutes, okay? So you asked him questions in class. Yes, I did. And he told us that Herzen went abroad to prepare the Great October revolution, together with Karl Marx. What should I do, cry or laugh? I'll send you abroad at home, you'll see! - Why are you fighting? It's a bad approach. That's not right. Go away, go. You know, Ilya Semyonovich, we can't have a "Fail" They will kick him out of Pioneers House, love, out of the dance group. Where will he go? Back on the street? - I didn't give him a "Fail". He's got a "Pass" "Limited Achievement" Thank you! - For God's sake don't thank me! You should not. You're reminding me again that I'm lying for you. No, it's not for me. It's not for me. In any case, not for Vova's chance to dance in that group. It's not his legs he should be exercising, it's his memory and speech. Memory. Memory, yes. Thanks for the advice. Ever cared to wonder why his memory's poor? And speech? Maybe his father's a third-generation alcoholic. Maybe my boy couldn't hold his head up until 18 months old. No one believed he'd survive. Kids on the street still call him "retard" I apologize. I shouldn't be saying that. The Russian teacher says "memory"... and the physics teacher too... This used to be my desk Will you excuse me, Natalya Sergeyevna? Come tomorrow, then - Let's call if off, maybe? - No, come tomorrow Nikolai Borisovich... wait, don't go yet I need a leave - What? I can't work anymore - Off with you! The school year's just begun What's up with you? Health problems? Liver? - It's the geography teacher who's got liver. Ah, right. So what's up with you? Well... general condition Aren't you dodging? Have you decided to finish your thesis? - Come on, it's a thing of the past. A shame! I've been long wanting to tell you, now's the right time for that subject. Great recommendation for the research. And a strong stimulus to finish it. "The right time" Did you try vitamin B12? Bum injections? It helped my wife May I write a request? It's not a sensible conversation, Ilya Semyonovich. To get a leave at the beginning of the year, one needs a reason so serious, that God forbid... What if my reason's exactly that serious? Who can determine? Medical science, of course Do you hear me? - No. Because you don't hear me Have you thought who am I going to replace you with? You can replace me with yourself. We graduated in the same major. Can you allow me to teach now? Mangle young souls? My views are malleable. I change easily. I swear by fresh newspapers. That's what you used to say. - I did "I did." Oh, brother, the things you've been saying... An historian! I'm an administrator, Ilya. I get new equipment, and I'm happy. I manage to get air-conditioners, and I'm proud We are not thinking of others enough Here's a simple example: Svetlana Mikhailovna has been teaching here for 20 years tomorrow. Fine, let's collect three rubles apiece and buy her... a crocodile Even jokes you make are principled You know, Ilya... one can respect you but it's hard to love you. - Okay, don't love me. Give me my leave I won't You want to have rest? To nurse your honesty? Let others build? Once it's all finished - welcome Ilya Semenovich - and you won't shake our hands, saying "You've got your hands dirty, while building" Depending on what kind of dirt, I might not want to shake it. - Exactly. That sums you up You know, Ilya... Principles, they won't feed you, or improve your health, or keep you warm Principles are not kebab, or vitamin B12, or hot-water bottle Some eccentrics sacrifice their lunch for them Sometimes even more than that. In 1941, near Vyazma, you and I knew it very well History is a discipline which makes a human a citizen Right? - Okay, right Here's a textbook published this year. This year! - Come on, Ilya. Life goes on Have you ever thought about the huge importance of paper? We should acknowledge its endless patience You can write on it: "Upon the hills of Georgia lies darkness of the night" or a squeal about on a neighbour One can rewrite the thesis to take out just one name, one fact to shift the accents. If there's enough paper, why not? It will withstand anything But our souls and the kids' souls are not made of paper, Kolya Want to see how they pleased me today? Interesting. - Interesting, indeed Strip-tease of the soul I don't think so - You don't have to We have different experience and different moral values The goal is the same, though You're a happy person, Natasha Me? Yeah, as happy as a clam You know... - I know, my girl, I know Just don't delay with the baby, you both. It's a common teachers' problem That princess is right, after all Though it's beyond her reach Oh yes Otherwise you'll be left to deal with other people's happiness only I've got it here, of 24 sorts, for all tastes Two Katerinas, one Bazarov All the rest is about happiness You go now If you can't give me a leave, just fire me then and the hell with it! What are you going to do then? Plant gooseberry? Write memoirs? I can be a guide at a museum You think the exposition there doesn't change? It does. - So what's the difference? There, I'll deal with random people. They come once, listen, and go away And here... - I'm not satisfied with your explanations Are you satisfied with a teacher who's no longer a teacher? What do you mean, no longer a teacher? To sow wise, kind and eternal things... and see thistle and hemlock to grow. - Enough of this symbolism That's nonsense, dear Ilya. Who's a teacher if you aren't one. And who are you if aren't a teacher? Let me have my leave Honestly... after all, can't I have my personal reasons? Write your request. Take your leave, go to the museum, to the circus, wherever you want. Thank you You came to see me? - Not you, no Let's discuss it, okay? Syromyatnikov, either leave or sit like a normal person As if I need this! You were saying, that things are boring, no social work Go on, make suggestions then Write it down Activity one: baptizing Nadya's babies What was that for? Is she crazy? I was just kidding. Not good, Kostya. She's had her share today. Who asked her to show her sincerity? Everyone might have ideas. Why share them in essays? Happiness for a grade. Nonsense And you, what did you write, then? - I didn't touch on that subject at all I was peacefully writing about Bazarov Enough! Batischev's right. After this essay, some look like fools, and others - like scoundrels Why are you cursing? - It's not why we gathered here, Shestopalov Sit down, Sveta. You're a good person, but you better sit down I got it now. Those who wrote sincerely like Nadya, they are fools and will be taunted Who lied and used the P2 principle, those are scoundrels. - What's P2? The first P is for "pick right", the second P - for "please" When famous people's thoughts and quotes neatly prepared at home, and an "HD" is virtually guaranteed. Do we have people like that, Ella? - I don't know. Perhaps So what do you suggest? - To go home Everything's clear. Everyone's happy Gena Esq. Why are you so sad? - Drop it, Gena Are you familiar with the damn's worth theory? Use it to look at things. It helps - I'll try You know what, let's go to my place? I'm almost fixed with the tape recorder, you could help I don't feel like it I know what you feel like. You want me to scram, and Rita to say with you. Am I right? It can be arranged. I'm not greedy, right, Rita? Gena, say yes, or he'll change his mind You'll walk and talk, or go to the movies. Say something I don't have any money. - No need, I've got three rubles No, I have to pay him rental. How much per hour, Kostya? Idiot! Yeah, you can end up without an eye for such jokes. - Nutcase! You should see a doctor, Shestopalov, you know You've got a hypersensitive ego, like every shorty You want a slap, too? You'll get it! Go on. Go On my way home, I was thinking of you... My scattered thoughts were wandering about... The Book of Wandering, I thought it would not lie. I hoped that in some chapter your shore will appear out of the fog, out of weightless mist But the ship's chart is wrong, I see it clearly now. The Earth is spinning madly, but we are as distant as ever Some more? You write much better now. More artistic Okay, we should go Otherwise someone will come and start yelling - There's no one else in the school There's always someone in the school. Even at night Imagine that there's no one. Just us Don't count on me getting all lyrical because of your poetry I don't. I'm not such an Utopian After all, that's not what verses are written for Come on I've warned you Nothing will ever happen between us You see... You're a little boy, Gena I was like that in 7th grade You want the truth? - Well? Rationally, I know that, as a person, you're nothing special Not a ray of light in the darkness That's interesting - I know that and yet I try to disregard it What? - I'm sorry, you won't understand it I've only understood it 2 days ago myself So what did you understand 2 days ago? That everyone needs to be in love. With someone, or something. Always, all the time Life is boring otherwise For me, the easiest thing is to fall in love with you. For the lack of better So you don't care what I think of you? - Nope. It doesn't change a thing What's important is the impulse inside So you are free to think that it's not you that I'm in love with It might be, say, Cherevichkina Poetry is easier, huh? Dedicate your poems to Cherevichkina from now on Good luck Natasha! Modelling different creative processes defined by gifts, predispositions and, finally, the talents, is a daring but manageable task I'm holding some sheet music. This music was written by an electronic composer Don't be surprised. Of course, humans were setting tasks for this electronic composer You be the judges of the composition's merits There will be viewers who would say: "A machine cannot feel, and emotions are the essence of music" But first of all... First of all, we should define precisely what is a human emotion, soul, human itself Will he define, I wonder? And then, the music you'll hear isn't Mozart, of course Thanks for that Everything's got cold Mom... give me some vodka And a glass Oh, a strange letter arrived for you today, I signed "News of Music" program is over In a few minutes, we will resume the broadcast of the hockey match from the Sports Palace Dear comrade Melnikov, I am very busy and therefore forced to address you in writing. My daughter has been regularly getting poor grades for your subject, which is surprising and worrying. After all, history is not mathematics, one doesn't need be too smart to master it. I have personally ... they have personally, you see? checked her knowledge of the textbook's chapters 61 to 65, and I consider B (High Achievement) to be an appropriate grade. I strongly recommend you re-check my daughter's knowledge of the above-mentioned chapters. Potekhin. A big shot All that on an official letterhead. He couldn't be bothered to buy paper Why are you so worried? You said once, if someone is dim it's incurable Voltaire said it, not me. Mom, he's not so dim He's inspired... by the memories Hey, look what I found Vanya Kovalyov. Remember the article about him? A prominent physicist - I remember Thanks, mom. I'm full To Polina Andreevna, the mother of the man we admire. From Natasha Gorelova. June 28, 1960. Is it drizzling again? Mom, have you ever noticed some despair in impersonal sentences? It's drizzling... it's windy... it's getting dark. You know why? No one to complain about And no one to fight If someone calls, I'm not here Hello? He's not in Oh... hello... hello? You said you weren't here SATURDAY Igor Stepanovich! I didn't notice you. - I'm in soft slippers Hello - Good morning, good morning I came to criticize you, Natasha - What's the matter? It's not right, you know. You're our young promising specialist And you don't want to share our life You didn't even give me your phone number - What for? Just in case No big deal, the registry will tell By the way, agents informed that you're waiting for comrade Melnikov every day Don't deny it. Only sincere acknowledgement might mitigate your fate And the fate below average, dear Natasha He's got the dust of centuries on his glasses He's not interested in women, except Joan of Arc Hello. - Hello, Svetlana Mikhailovna I've got your number already, by the way We'll continue our conversation, I guess Natasha Hello You don't have the first lesson, do you? - Really? I must have mixed up days Allochka, just from home and calling already? - As usual - Formally, everyone's here, but the thoughts are either back home or God knows where Good morning - Hello Hello Good morning - Good morning. Taisia Nikolaevna... I'm sorry for what happened yesterday It's okay No, no, no Hey, Ilya Semyonovich... This is for you For me? Working in school for 20 years is something Not that easy, right? - Wow, that's right! Comrades, I think we must celebrate the anniversary properly and solemnly... Good morning - Good morning Didn't you receive anything from my dad? A letter? - I did, and could you please tell him... Don't Ilya Semyonovich. Never mind, please. He's writing letters like that to everyone Like who? - Everyone. Even the minister of culture Complaining that they film actors in wrong postures. Please forgive him. Okay? Here. Tell the kids the lesson will be in the classroom. Let me sit at your lesson! - What for? Don't ask questions. Just let me in. I came an hour before my own lesson Bullshit - I heard it myself. I sat behind the principal's door and heard everything Come in, Natalya Sergeyevna Sit down Borisov's not here? He's kind of sick Last time we talked about the 17th October Manifesto... quiet, please... About the beginning of the first Russian revolution. We'll revise that and move on Syromyatnikov What? - Are you prepared? - More or less I have to go out there? - Right We're listening Okay. The tsar's policy was cowardly and perdifious. - What? Perdifious. - Perfidious. That means, disloyal Or treacherous. - Yes Okay, go on. - Fearful for his tsarist position the tsar, of course, issued a manifesto. He was promising the people a paradise on earth... Could you be more specific? Different freedoms... of speech... of assembly... Really, what's the point? He didn't do what he promised, why should I repeat his lies? After, the tsar displayed his nasty nature again and continue ruling as before So... you know... there... what's it called... No one could tell him a thing. And... after Peter the Great Russia didn't have much luck with tsars. That's my personal opinion. Suppose I give him a "Fail", then he grows up to be Yuri Nikulin, And it will look like I nearly strangled the future of National Art. - So don't. Why "Fail"? For "more or less" Here lies the happiness of class 9-B Instead of firm actions, Shmidt sent telegrams to Nicholas II demanding democratic freedoms. In the meanwhile, the authorities overcame the initial surprise and gathered troops The cruiser "Ochakov" was shelled and set on fire Shmidt was executed. He reaped the fruit of his political naivety and short-sightedness His show of heroism had little effect Poor Shmidt, if he could only foresee this posthumous reprimand I'm not inventing anything, am I? I hear it all the time: "Jaures didn't consider", "Herzen couldn't see", "Tolstoy failed to understand"... As if history was made by a gang of underachievers Anyone wants to object? Add something? There's only 15 lines in the textbook about him At your age, people read other books, too Other books? No problem. In "The Golden Calf," for example, Ostap Bender and his cronies pretended to be sons of Lieutenant Shmidt. Want to hear it? - Some other time Can anyone add something? Fifteen lines Most people only get a dash between two dates What kind of man he was, Lieutenant Petr Petrovich Shmidt? Russian intellectual, a gifted man, a brave officer, a seasoned sailor, an artistic soul He sang, played cello, drew... he was a brilliant public speaker But his most precious gift was the ability to feel other people's suffering more acutely than his own This gift produces rebels and poets Just imagine, once he met a woman on a train. They spoke for 40 minutes, and he fell deeply in love. Forever. With her, or with the image of her he had invented... But it was a beautiful story. 40 minutes, and then there were letters, hundreds of them. They're published. Read them, and you won't dare judge this man's mistakes and illusions with such arrogance But he did make the mistakes, right? - Sit down for now Petr Shmidt was against violence, like Dostoyevsky's Ivan Karamazov He rejected universal harmony, if a single child was sacrificed for its sake He couldn't, wouldn't believe, that the language of machine-guns is the only one to speak to the tsar Bloodless harmony Was it naive? Yes. A mistake? Yes. But I invite Batischev and everyone else to think again and understand the high price of such mistakes Listen, Kostya The rebellion has started, and it's to you, living 60 years ago the rebellious "Ochakov" sailors come and say: "The navy and the revolution need you" You know that the rebellion is doomed. Your only cruiser doesn't have any armour, or shells, its speed is barely 8 knots. What would you do? Leave the sailors alone under the guns of admiral Chukhnin or go and lead the rebellion? And stand under fire and surely die. - Without a chance of success? What's the point? You and your points! - That's right, Rita. Quiet, quiet So, the question is: What is the point of Shmidt's actions and his death? It's obvious, right? - If not for men like him, there'd be no revolution! He explained it himself in his final speech, in court. He explained in such a manner that even the guards put their rifles aside and were tried afterwards for that. Fifteen lines. May I, Ilya Semyonovich? - Yes Pardon my intrusion Sit down Something outrageous has happened Last night someone came into the teachers' room, took the essays written by your class and burned them. Yes, burned And at the crime scene - I'm not trying to joke here - he left this... explanation Which is both impudent and abstruse I don't need to explain how cruel, how inhumane the perpetrator was to Svetlana Mikhailovna I won't discuss the political implications of these actions either. There's just one thing I'd like to know: Who did it? I hope, I won't be forced into humiliating you and myself by comparing handwriting and the like. You won't You, Shestopalov? - Me Come with me - With my things? - Yes, take your stuff Natalya Sergeyevna, why are you here? Ilya Semyonovich allowed me. - Right Got the picture? Sit down Where was I? You were saying that 15 lines is a lot Right He went to the principal, Natalya Sergeyevna? - Where else? Guys, Shestopalov's finished. - Why did he burn them without telling anyone? Just to be special. To show off Hello - Hello ...you read this message. Read what it says. He's judging everyone by his standards. - He wrote an explanation, we should read it. He's just a nerd. - What? You're a nerd yourself - I'm completely normal I am absolutely against it. We know very little about them, and we completely neglect our direct duty. Which is? - Education, Svetlana Mikhailovna So what now, Shestopalov? I think it's too early to fight. You better think. It's rather strange You've been studying with Shestopalov for 9 years, and yet you don't know him. We do. He's honest Well, if he's honest... Sit down You know what I heard? That our principal had carried Ilya Semyonovich from behind enemy lines, when he was wounded. Is it true? It is true Is it true that Ilya Semyonovich is leaving? Leaving? What makes you say that? Rumour That's bullshit, Natalya Sergeyevna. - Never mind, it's just gossip! So I won't come to school tomorrow Give me a cigarette. - A glass of water, maybe? Damn no, give me a cig Go to the classroom Don't even think of coming tomorrow without your parents! It'll be okay, don't get upset I'm sorry, Ilya Semyonovich. - Go to the classroom, I said Well, thank you, Ilya Semyonovich! - The wrong end. An excellent present. So, a teacher's authority is nothing? Everything's allowed? Svetlana Mikhailovna! - You want me to quit? That's not what you should be saying. You teach literature. A student wrote you a piece of poetry. How is it a bad thing? Don't! I'm not completely crazy yet, you know. We give them all we've got, and they... - What do we have to give, that's the question "The fools made fools of themselves", he writes - who are they? - Well, in this case, I'm afraid, that's us. If he's wrong, we still have time to prove that we are better than we seem Prove? To whom? - To them. Every day, at every lesson If we can't, we should take up another trade, where bad job is less crucial Are you rehearsing your speech for the board? Excuse me, Svetlana Mikhailovna. They're waiting for me. - Why do you hate me so? It's not you... how can I explain so that you would understand? - One should have a heart to do that Natalya Sergeyevna, I'll go have a look, okay? Sit, sit Go Thank you, Natalya Sergeyevna Thanks. The board's on Monday. - They didn't expel you? - Nope He helped? - Yep This has been an amazingly productive lesson And now it's time to say goodbye Next time we'll discuss the December armed rebellion in Moscow and I sincerely hope you won't burn the school down before that Natasha... I salvaged this. Do you want to hear? - I do - Take a sit "It is not a tale, it's not a fable. I saw it, and the others saw it, too: How they tried to turn a majestic crane Into a silly tame sparrow. To deprive him of the blue infinity, to bind him to the ground they ringed and restrained him, and registered in the note book. They hid the white bird of my happiness in the cabinet, tied up his wings and made him breathe lukewarm dust and forget all dreams... But the bird had grown strong in the skies! The fools made fools of themselves Broken cage, handful of ashes and the crane's back in the clouds! Do you know what he wrote in his essay? - No one will ever know now I happen to know, by chance. He wrote "Happiness is to be appreciated" Was that it? - That's it I deserved it Get up, you'll catch a cold LET'S LIVE TILL MONDAY VYACHESLAV TIKHONOV IRINA PECHERNIKOVA NINA MENSHIKOVA MIKHAIL ZIMIN N.
