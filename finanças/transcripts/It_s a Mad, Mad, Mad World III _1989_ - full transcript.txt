- We're rich! - We're rich! IT'S A MAD MAD WORLD - Hurry! - Hurry up! Dear! We'll become rich this time. I just won the lottery! There is no need for you to overreact! I'm going to Canada, Smiley Joe! Will you flirt while you're in Hong Kong? I'm rich! That means I'm going for a long vacation! - I can't resist that. - What? Do you think I have no other admirers? My love is too much for you. This afternoon at 3:00 p.m., the Hang Fung Bank has announced its bankruptcy. A flood of citizens have been rushing to the bank to withdraw money. However, the Finance Minister said the account holders - cannot collect their deposits. - Please return my money! IT'S A MAD MAD WORLD 2 They're over there! Come quickly! Dad, what took you so long? We won the lottery, but someone took our ticket. - Where are those crooks? - Those crooks are at 24th Street. - We can't get our money after 5 p.m. - 24th Street? I know where that is. - I'll get the car. - I'll go with you. Hurry! - Don't you run away! - Hand over my money! This winning ticket expires after 5 p.m. today. Hit him! Give it back to me! Sir, the ticket's right here. - I'll grab the ticket first. - You again. - Dear, help! - I'm coming! - Hit him. - Hit him. It was already 5.10 p.m. when I got here. I pedaled as hard as I could. Don't cry, dear. Today is December 23, not December 24. You dummy. Yes, it's December 23. Yes, it's December 23. December 23? Dear, I get it now! Hong Kong is 16 hours ahead. Today in Canada is not really today in Hong Kong. Today in Canada means yesterday in Hong Kong. Where is the ticket? - Here. - Thank goodness. You said today is the last day. It's not today. Tomorrow is the last day. - We're rich! - Great! Dear, after we claim the money tomorrow, we have to share some with Loi Dai's classmate. I mean, he treats us so well and he lets us stay in his home. All right. - Do you think I lack conscience? - Then sleep early. - How can I sleep? - Good boy. Then why don't you go see your daughters? Good boy. Mom's got you. Is your classmate not back yet? He doesn't come home early. He's doing a part-time job. - Why are you still up? - I'm finishing my assignment. - I have to submit it after the holidays. - Keep studying hard. I have plenty of money for your tuition fees. How's that? Thanks, Dad. - Go to bed as soon as you're finished. - Okay. What's up with you? I can get paid more if I dress up as Santa Claus. Here is a Christmas present. You or the chicken? I'm giving both to you. I don't want you, but I don't mind taking the chicken. Look at them! Aren't they ashamed of themselves? Move your leg. Hey. Put this in the middle. - Let's go. - Okay. - You go first. - Okay. We'd like to claim our prize. We won! Money. How is it? Is it gone? Where has it gone to? Can you find it? The first prize! Ngun. Yes. He said you look fatter. Yes. I was pregnant many times. - Piu. - Piu. Yes. Let me keep this. Hey, now what? He's gone. - He's getting our money. Relax! - I see. Hey. Do you think he ran away? It's been so long. He couldn't have. It's government-owned. I'm talking about that manager. That... Darn. The lights are out. - Go out and see what's going on! - Let's go! I don't see him anywhere. Did he run away? Ask someone and see if they saw the manager. Let's ask those two. Have you seen the manager? How can she just leave like that? Hey, go check in the front. Stop it. - We're here to claim our prize money. - Our prize money! Why did you give me an apple? - We're looking for the manager. - Yes. - Honey, it's him! - It's him! - Give us the money. - It's him! Give us the money! What? Several million dollars turned into a dollar? - A dollar? You are crazy! - You take it! Here. My goodness! Dear! It's a huge check! It's a huge check. I wonder if we can cash it. What are you talking about? Don't you watch television? They always hand over a huge check as the cash prize. It makes us an easy target for thieves. How can we take it? Yes. Take off your coat and wrap it around the check. Then nobody will know. What? Here's the real check! Does it look good? It's the most popular color this year. Not bad! You're just like a fox! You're calling me a fox? Then you're as dumb as a pig. Shoot! - Loi Dai, this is bad. - What is it? Here I am, Mia. I heard you got burnt in a fire. The surgery seems great. Hey! Do you know who I am? You're just a man. My dad lied to the neighbors. This is Momo, my fianc√©. He's Smiley Joe, my ex-boyfriend. I'm not your past, but your future. I want to take care of you for the second half of your life. Smiley Joe. Second half of her? I'm at a disadvantage here! I also want the top half. I want all of her. Mia, I want all of you. No one can touch you. Well, I touch her every day. Stop it. Stop arguing. Mia, you shouldn't be cheating on me like that. Tell him that you love me, Bobo. That's too mushy! If you don't mind, then split me into two. I'm left-handed, so I'll take the right side. I want the left side. - I want the front. - I'll take the back. Damn! I'm at a loss here. You'll get used to it. Right, Mia? Ouch. You beat me because you love me. - Hey, slap me too. - Okay. - I'll grant your wish. - Gosh. Knock it off, you two! Love can't be forced. You two should head back. Give her some time to think it over. You two should leave. Stop disturbing them from doing their homework. I just came here and I have no place to go. If you don't mind, you can sleep in our living room. - Sure! - No way! - Sleep at my place. - Why are you so generous all of a sudden? I can't have you approaching her. Hey, dear. Didn't we win over ten million dollars? Why are we left with only a few million? There are so many taxes to pay like lottery, sales, and amusement taxes. That's why we're only left with this amount of money. Come to think of it, Hong Kong is more practical. I won 19 million dollars last time. And I received the entire amount, right? How could you compare those two? Each country has their own set of rules. Dear, let's travel. Travel for what? People say that Venice, the City of Water, is a very beautiful place. We have water in Hong Kong. Where? Typhoon Shelter! You can find all kinds of seafood there. They say Venice is a beautiful and romantic place. Yes, Venice is a very beautiful place. Did you hear that? He also said Venice is beautiful. - Hey! This foreigner speaks Chinese. - What? Gosh, you're right. What do we do? He knows all our secrets now. That's right. I heard everything. Look! There's no one in sight. Nobody knows what he wants to do. See what I mean? His car stopped before I even finished saying it. Sorry, my car broke down. I'll have to step out and see what's wrong. - Hey. Keep an eye on him. - Okay. Don't forget to secure the check. Don't worry! It's a crossed check. He can kidnap us. You're right. He can kill us. Look! A big sack. It's quite deep below the bridge. Let's get some tools, just in case. Come! - Hey, go fetch something else. - Okay. Take this. Go. I've got one. Thanks! His wrench is bigger than ours. The two of us can crush him. He might have accomplices. Excuse me. I have to make a call to get some help. - Go to hell! - What? - Let's go. - Wait! Still alive? Help me up, dear. - I feel dizzy. - Let's go! - Okay. - Hey! Hey! Why haven't Mom and Dad returned home yet? Right. It's over 4 p.m. It's already dark outside. Dad, Mom. - Dad, Mom. - Dad, Mom. Dad, did you get into a fight? Who would dare attack us with your mom around? Right. That was quite a scare just now. That cab driver tried to kidnap us. Luckily, I crushed him with my weight. I crushed him so hard that he couldn't move. That's amazing, Mom! Of course! By the way, dear, with so many people here knowing that we won the lottery, I'm a bit scared to go out. - What's your point? - Why don't we return to Hong Kong? Of course, we can't just sit here and wait for people to rob us. Loi Dai, check for plane tickets. Mom, why don't you guys go back first? I want to stay here until I graduate. - Sure! - How can we allow that? We'll worry about you if we leave you here. I am a grown up now, Mom. That's right. She is a grown up. - Yes. - It's because she's a grown up. Didn't you see how she was sleeping this morning? That was inappropriate! - We do that all the time. - What? We do that when we have classmates over since there isn't enough space. People who study abroad with that attitude are the worst. They always tend to follow the Westerners. It's excusable if you didn't have money. Be it a slave or a dog, you'd be one. This is the true spirit of being Chinese. Flexibility is our forte! Now that we have earned foreign dollars, we have to return to our homeland as proud descendants of the royalty and of the dragon! Since our family came here together, we have to leave together. No negotiations! He's right. Be a good girl and listen to your dad. I'm 21 already, I can take care of myself. - She's right. She-- - What's right? So what if you're 21? Even if you're 81, you're still my daughter. Our daughter's a university student now. She's mature enough. - Let me go back after I graduate. - Right. Two years will go by quickly. Don't tell me you don't want her to graduate. Right? All right! You can stay. But you're not allowed to live with Sam from now on. I see. So that's what this is all about. We did nothing wrong. If it wasn't for him tutoring me, I wouldn't be able to keep up. - That's right. - Stop agreeing with her. It may be fine when we are around. But once we're gone... I could've done it already if I wanted to. That's enough. Stop talking back to your dad. Forget it! I just want to learn to be independent. Learn to be independent? Over here, anything you learn is useless! Your skin is yellow! You, come over here. I'll give you 100,000 dollars. Don't touch my daughter ever again. - Stop it. - What do you mean? Two hundred thousand! Dad, will you please stop insulting my friend with money? You call it an insult? I'm giving him money. Back in the day, I couldn't even find someone to insult me with money. It's 200,000 Canadian dollars. It's a big sum, not an insult! Forget it. Why don't you obey your dad? Go home with us. That would mean we admit of doing something wrong. Yes, sir. We've been good. We've done nothing wrong. I'll ask you one last time. Are you going back with us? Don't be so overbearing! I just want to reason with you. I'm overbearing? Very well. If you don't break up with him, you're no longer my daughter! Stop arguing! There's no need for the argument to come to this. Do you want to break the family apart? All right. I've decided to go back to Hong Kong. Anyone who wants to follow me, come! - Hey! Dear! - Mom! Dear! Dad, Mom! Mom! Sorry about that. I should be the one apologizing. You're really something. You came to pick us up even though we're distant relatives. Well, of course! My mom called me and told me that you guys are rich now. His name is now famous all over Chinatown these days. Dear, it's a good thing that we left so quickly. Otherwise, there'd be lots of trouble. Of course. Once someone gets rich, danger is always around. That's why I was smart about it. I've arranged a car for your pickup from the airport. It's safer this way, isn't it? That's so thoughtful of you. That reminds me. How much did it cost to rent this Rolls-Royce? It's free. I've also arranged two presidential suites for you. You'll also have free transportation. What? - Hello? - Mom! - Dai Dai? - Yes! Mom, this is the first time I've ever sat in a Rolls-Royce. It's so much fun! Mom, there's even a television in here! What's so nice about watching on that tiny screen? Just wait until you see the size of the television at our presidential suite! We... No, I mean, I miss you! Of course not! I treat him like my little brother. Lend me some of your laundry detergents. Go ahead! Just make yourself at home! Bobo. I've booked a plane ticket to meet up with you next week. I don't know. Hey! When are you heading back to Hong Kong? I've only been here for two days. I should mess around for a while first. He said he wants to mess around. Hey! Aren't you afraid Bobo's going to scold you if you screw around? What an idiot! Do you tell your mom when you have to urinate? Hey. Who's on the phone? - Bobo, he said you're an idiot! - Hey! You're despicable! Bobo, he said you're despicable. Mia, that's not what I mean-- Just hang up. Explain when you're back in Hong Kong. What happened here? You told me to make myself at home. That's how my home is like. And this is how I eat peanuts at home! - You're leaving? - Yes. Am I being too stubborn? Not really. You're just obeying your dad's orders. It's not a bad thing to return to Hong Kong. You'll be on your own from now on. It'll be the same for you. Take care. I will. A present for you. I'll put it on for you. Hey, why don't you take me to the airport? Sure. I'll carry this for you. Right, I'll visit you during the Easter holidays. - Will you be there? - Of course I will. I'll find more part-time jobs to earn enough money for plane tickets. Don't work too hard or you'll tire yourself out. You have to study hard. You don't need to send me off. You don't need to. Go now. Go! Go! Have you decided to stay here with me? You wish! I've decided to stay here for two years until I graduate. What are you waiting for? Go and grab my luggage. That stinks. You fatty! - It's too crowded! - Dad, why don't we take a taxi? A taxi costs over 100,000 dollars while a bus costs a few million dollars. So which one is more expensive? We'll switch to a taxi once we get to the station. - Great! - No need for a taxi. It's just a short walking distance. Aren't you worried about getting robbed when you're carrying so much money? Hey! Hold on to your pockets. Hey! Someone's watching you! Don't forget my back pockets. I'm right behind you. - What's the matter with you? - How can you drive like that? Stop pushing! It's crowded here! We can visit our old neighbors again. - Don't move. - What is it? - Take three steps back. - Okay. It'll remain unchanged for 50 years. Luckily, we were trained well. Dodge! It's only been a month since we last came and you've already become slow. - I told you not to come here. It's dirty. - Let's go. It's your childhood home after all. Never forget your roots. Now that's a huge glass of water, Dad. Let's go. Thanks! - Good fortune to all! - Thanks! Grab a red envelope, everyone. I wish you good fortune. - Mr. And Mrs. Lui! - There's one for everybody. - What about me? - One by one! Yes! Thanks! Wow! We're rich! We lent you 4,000 dollars, but you returned 8,000. The interest rate is even higher than a loan shark's. - The money doubled! - Thank you, Mr. And Mrs. Lui. - No need to thank us. - Thank you. My dear neighbors, there is no need to say that. If it wasn't for everyone's help at the time, I wouldn't have gotten what I have today. - You are welcome. - You are welcome. Come to think of it, I should feel ashamed of myself for taking all your money. Well, even saints make mistakes. That's right! That's why you lie all the time. Also, that person lent you 300 dollars, but said it was 500. - That's right. - Forget it. It's just a small figure. Just leave it at that. You're so generous. Then I'll forget about all the mahjong debts I owe you. Forget it! What about me? - Here. There's one for everyone. - Mrs. Mo never lent us any money. Don't talk too much, kid! We have to share our fortune. - What's important is to be happy, right? - Yes! Mom sent 200,000 dollars to me today. - I can take care of you from now on. - No way! I don't even use my dad's money for my education. How can I use yours? I'm just kidding. I won't spend it either. I'd rather take a part-time job. But you'll have your exams soon. You can use mine for now. I'll just find more part-time jobs. No way! If you do that, it's like you're not taking me as your boyfriend. - What? - What? Well... I mean, it's like you're not taking me as a friend. Even friends have an obligation in financial assistance. What if it's a boyfriend? Then, slaving over for you is worth it! Stop it. You're so mushy. Uncle, this area has great surroundings. You can get a full glimpse of Victoria Harbour. But the northwest winds are too strong. Wait! Sir, the master bedroom is even better. It's facing Lei Yue Mun. You can watch the sunrise from the bed every morning. Then, I won't ever get any decent sleep. Dad, this living room is huge! - We can throw a party every day. - Right! Then, we'll never get proper sleep, silly girl. Dad, this toilet is huge. Make sure you don't get flushed along! Dear, I want this room to be my mahjong room. Then, there will never be a peaceful day. You're even harder to satisfy than the others. Speaking of which, I'll have to think it over. No need to think about it. The housing prices are going up rapidly. Well, I'm afraid they'll plummet once 1997 arrives. Sir, you don't have to pay rent if you buy a place. What about the rates and taxes? That's nothing! It's similar to buying yourself a meal. Speak for yourself. Dear, let's leave. I don't care! It wasn't easy for us to get rich. I must live in a luxurious condo and get a dog. - Yes! - Yes! We're not buying it. I want to buy it. - We're not buying. - I have to buy it! Wait. Pipe down. We live in a democratic society. Let's decide with a vote. Those who agree, raise your hand. Why are you raising your hand? It's none of your concern. Well, isn't it one vote per person? All the rich people will soon migrate. By the time I want to sell it, who is going to buy it from me? Then, let's rent it. - Be careful! - Be careful! Sir. Didn't I tell you it's a bargain to rent here? You've got the front, the back, the top and the bottom. Don't forget the left and the right. - How'd you know that? - Idiot! - Let's go play, Dai Dai. - Sure! Play a little better! You're fine, but you're just insincere. - Come on! - You say everything is good. Good catch! You're insincere and contemptible. Sir, honestly, her volleyball skills are excellent. Mia! - Momo! - Bobo! Smiley Joe? Smiley Joe. Why do you look so unhappy? Nothing. I thought you don't love me anymore. Come and have some fun together, Smiley Joe! - Let's go! - Come. Dear. - Dear! - What is it? - Dear. - Dear. Look at our daughter. We have to lecture her sometime. A man on her left and another on her right. - It's excusable for a man. - What? Men also have to be faithful. Faithful. - Join in on the fun! - You guys have fun! - This dilemma is no simple matter, dear. - Yes? You have to fix this. Or else, we won't know what to do about it. - Yes. - Let me ask you. If it was you, which one would you pick? Me? Of course, I'd pick Smiley Joe. He's humorous and he's good at cheering us up. - Am I right about that? - Momo is not bad either. He helped us a lot in Canada. Right. What do we do then? Let's get her here and question her. Okay. Dai Dai! Coming! - What is it? - Dai Dai. Between those two, who exactly do you like? I don't know. How can you not know? You have to pick one. It's dangerous not to. Why are you two so nervous? It's not like you're me! It's simple, Dai Dai! Just let the coin decide for you. Hey! Can you lend me a coin? Here. You'll be heads, you'll be tails. Ready. Oh dear! Neither of you wins. It's pungent tofutti. I'll give you a demonstration. I guarantee your satisfaction. Pungent tofutti! Homemade pungent tofutti! Pungent tofutti! We surely won't get enough nutrition this time. What? Only salted fish? What's wrong with it? It costs more than a chicken! - Mom. - Have you fed the baby? Yes. He's all fed and fast asleep. You almost finished all the food and left so little for me! We just started eating dinner. What? Just started? What the heck? Marianne must be saving up the money. - Marianne! - Wait. I ordered her to do this. What's wrong with you? We're rich now. It's because we are rich. Therefore, we should not spoil ourselves with luxury. We should practice Buddhism. We should resist temptations, stop eating meat and become vegetarians. So that means life is worse than before. What are you talking about? I'm doing this for your own good. As the saying goes, fortune is slim when men live like pigs. What bullshit. So being rich is like being broke. We can only stare at our money, but never spend it? What's wrong if we can't spend it? It's enough of a satisfaction to just look at it. Since when have we ever looked at it? That's right! We have no idea how much 30 million dollars is. Yes, honey! Just exactly how much is 30 million dollars? Excuse me, Mr. Lui. You've probably written the wrong amount. Have I? One, ten, hundred, ten thousand, hundred thousand, million. No, it's the correct amount. We want them all divided in ten dollar bills. Please wait a moment. Manager! What? Who is joking around? Do we have so many ten dollar bills? Contact all the other major banks and get them for me. It won't take long. Please wait. Yes, ten dollar bills. All of them. - This is the Sha Tin branch. - They say they offer excellent service, - It's urgent. - Yet they take so long. Dear, are you sure our money will be safe in here? We'll find out as soon as they gather all our money. - So, how is it now? - No problem. I'm on it, so don't you worry! The money will come immediately. Ten dollar bills. All in ten dollar bills. I don't see why a huge bank like this do not have enough ten dollar bills. Just to be clear, I want fresh and new cash. All in ten dollar bills. The money will be here immediately. No problem. Mr. Wong, we need 30 million dollars, all in ten dollar bills. Since you asked for it, there's no reason for me not to help out. I struck it rich all thanks to your Hong Kong dollars. Amazing! That's a lot! Gosh. I can't even finish counting them all. Just looking at it makes you dizzy, doesn't it? Mr. Lui, here's your 30 million dollars. Please count them. No need. I have full trust in you. Manager. - Can you take a picture of our family? - It's a lot! Yes, take a picture of us as a keepsake. Sure. Smile. It's a lot! This is fun! - It's beautiful. - One more. All the cash in here is genuine. Do you know how it feels to be rich now? Clearly! My future is bright! It's too bright! - What else can we do for you? - We've had enough fun. I want to re-deposit all the money into my account. - What? - Please do check on it. No need. I trust you. Let's get going! Loi Dai, do you have enough money to spend over there? I miss you very much. You don't need to send money to me anymore, Mom. My classmate and I are doing part-time jobs. Why don't I send the money back to you instead? I have money. You should be cautious of Sam. Sam's a very nice guy. You and Dad misunderstood him. Just be cautious of him. A single girl should be more careful. Others may take advantage of you. Mom, we don't even sleep in the same room. In that case, you better remember this. You'd better lock your doors when you sleep at night. It's getting late, you nag. Well, it's early in Canada. But it's late here. I don't mind the long-distance phone bills. - But we've still got to sleep! - All right. You go to bed first. I'll call you again tomorrow. Bye! Pungent tofutti! Come! Try this homemade pungent tofutti! Make way! Give me a chance. They found out I don't have a working permit, so I'm going to be deported. Then, when are you going back to Hong Kong? My flight is tomorrow at 8 a.m. It's all my fault. Don't be silly. I'm returning this book to you. This book isn't mine. But I've been looking for this book for a long time. - You can lend it to me. - All right. Wait. I've already talked with the landlord. I'll send the monthly rent to her. I've also deposited some money into your account. Study hard. I don't need the money. I'll return to Hong Kong with you. There are still two more years until you graduate. My grades are good. I can continue my studies in Hong Kong. You're really leaving with me? You've also sacrificed your studies for me. Aren't you afraid your dad will scold you? He's been waiting for me to return and spend time with him. Why don't we get married? I'll work hard and make money for your studies. You don't like being with me? Then, that's a yes. I'll head back to my room. Mom told me not to enter a boy's room. Then, we'll go to the living room. You're so bad! Hey! You lose! No! It's on the line. I'm sorry! I'll lower my head this time. - Very well. Let's play again. - Go on. Come on. What's wrong with him? How can a man have no pride? I wonder if he's attempting to deceive your daughter or even scam you for money. No way. My daughter is so young. This is no fun! Let's go back inside and watch TV! - Okay! - Let's go! Hey, Chiu Dai! Are you not playing now? Chiu Dai! Chiu Dai, let's play! Chiu Dai! - Go ahead. - Go ahead. - Hurry up. - You're so slow. - How's it going? Any luck? - It's not bad. - Two Circles. - I win! You win again! - You jinx! - You owe me 128 dollars. You made me lose double as soon as you walk over. - I owe you 24 dollars. - All right. Don't be angry, ma'am. - Let me get you a cup of tea. - Is it 128 dollars? - Okay. - Give me two dollars change. What would like to drink, ma'am? - Save it! - We're not that old! - What's your problem? - Anything will do. - Go away! - Sorry. I'll go get some tea. Where's my change? What's up with this guy? Besides being a suck-up, what else can he do? Rich people always have a suck-up near them. No wonder Mrs. Lui has one! - How else can she look rich? - You're right! With all the tax deductions, we're only left with 30 million dollars. - Seriously, I'm not that rich. - You call that a small sum? I've never even seen - 100,000 dollars in cash before. - Me too. So what if you've seen them? Last time, I took all the money out of the bank just to see it. It was nothing special! Thirty million dollars? I've never seen so much money in my life. - Show it to us. - Yes! It's no big deal. Why don't we take a look at it tomorrow after lunch? - Sure! Let's ask Mrs. Hui to come along. - Sure! Can you bring me too? No way. What's so good about staring at money? Since you have so much free time, you can mow the lawn tomorrow. - Right! Mow the lawn! - Right! Mow the lawn! Come! - This is going to be an eye-opener! - Yes. - Wait, sir. - Mrs. Lui. We're here to see our cash today. Come on in! - Come on in. - All of them? - Let me grab a good seat first! - Come in. Help yourselves. I'll make a call and have it arranged. We'd like to see it in 1,000 dollar bills this time. That's right. I'll check to see if we have it at the main branch. Help yourselves. They know me around here. - Just how much is 30 million dollars? - We'll find out soon. The manager's seat is very comfortable indeed. Yes, help yourself. It's too bad that Mrs. Hui can't make it today. She loves money so much. If she sees all the cash, she would have been so happy. Right. I've never seen 30 million dollars in cash before either. That's simple! We'll come again next week. I've never seen 30 million dollars in 500 dollar bills yet. Are you serious? What's taking so long? Does this bank really have the money? - Don't say that. - Yes. It'll be here soon. It's on the way! I know this place very well. Just make yourselves at home. Since we have to wait, why don't we play some card games? - Good idea! - Good idea! Hey! Can you get a deck of cards for us? Playing cards? Okay. The 1,000 dollar bills are completely new. Yes, they look so fresh. The pile looks like it shrank. - This is no fun. - Right. Mom! Next time, we should see them all in coins. It'd be nice to listen to all those coins rattle. Very well! We'll look at it in coins next week. What's so fun about looking at coins? It reeks. - What? The smell of the coins is nice. - I love that smell! Excuse me, Mrs. Lui. You're welcome to come again if you like. Sure! We want to see 30 million dollars in coins tomorrow. - That soon? - Yes. - Please sign here, Mrs. Lui. - Okay. Can you take a picture of us as a keepsake? - Good idea! - Come! - Come! - I'll stand here! - Is it okay if I stand here? - Take a good photo. - Stand closer. - Okay. Take a good photo. One more! Don't move! - No! Don't take my money! - Mom! - No! - Make it quick and shut up! Move it! Hurry! Take it! Take all of it! It takes so long to count to deposit. Don't be so mean! There's no loss for you. I'm sick of your daily nuisance. Go to hell! Hurry up! All right. Robbery! Shut up, you bitch! Free money for everybody! Robbery! The money's mine. Don't take it! - Give it back! The money's mine! - Give it back! - This is illegal parking. - Forget it. - Hey! - Here! Spend it. Robbery! - What? - Robbery! - Stop! - Don't open fire! - Robbery! - Robbery! What's the meaning of this? I love Mia. Therefore, I love you too. You're so nice to me. But I'm a good girl. How can I change partners day and night? There would be rumors. What do you mean by that? She means she's with you in the day and with me at night. I don't want you in the day, I want you during the night. No. I can't go on doing this. Dear God, between these two, can you tell me who loves me more? Of course, it's me! You're my only girlfriend since I was born. - Really? - Bullshit! That means you've only had one girlfriend. However, you'll get a second or third one. It doesn't mean you'll be faithful. I'm different. I've had many girlfriends. But none of them can compare to you. So, Smiley Joe, would you die for me? I would. What about you? I wouldn't. Don't you love me? It's not because of that. But if I die, I would no longer be able to love you. For the sake of loving you, I can't die. Liar! You wouldn't die because you love her money. When I proposed to her, I was richer than her. When I wooed her, she still lived in a housing estate. Stop arguing! You say you don't like me for my money. Then what do you like me for? I like you for that. - What's that? - Don't you know that? - It's that! - I see. I like whatever he likes you for. Mamma Mia! Your sad look makes you look really cool. You too, sir. Just like Garfield. It's cute. Mom, Dad, I'm so happy today. I finally found out they're not after my money. It doesn't matter if they are. The money is gone anyway. You're pretty funny, sir. You and Mia are both teasing us. We have a special news bulletin. A huge robbery occurred this afternoon at the Dai Fung Bank. - What a mess! - Can people be this bored? Withdrawing 30 million dollars just to see it? They got what they deserved! The robbers stormed into the bank's guestroom. It's all the manager's fault! Why did he encourage the robbers to take my money? The victims... It's okay if the money's gone. You can earn it back from now on. I mean, you'll feel happy when you go from poor to rich. You are rich now, but you'll get richer. You'll be even happier. And that concludes our special report. Fate is never in our hands. Great! Now that I'm richer than you, you can marry me! Hey! Am I invisible to you now? Knock it off! I'm in a lot of stress now. Don't be stressed. Your problems are my problems. My problems are our problems, right? - What do I have to do with this? - What do you mean? Mamma Mia's problems are Mia's problems. Mia's problems are our problems. Dad, are we going to have to start all over again? It's even worse than before. At least, we had a housing estate to live in then. Now, we don't even have that. Sir, it's simple if you want to live in a housing estate. Hey. It's difficult to apply for housing estates these days. My late dad left me one. I never returned it to the government. If you don't mind, you can stay there. This is a nice environment. That's right! We have good feng shui here. There's good fortune coming in from north, south, east and west. It's a place for all seasons. You think we're here on vacation? We just need a kennel to stay in for now. As long as you don't mind. This place really is a kennel. - You are not only modest, but also honest. - Thanks. Really? Dogs are not allowed in housing estates. They all came by themselves. They like this place. Please come in. Smiley Joe, why are they all female? I don't know. - There's still more? - Sir. Dogs bring in financial luck. Cleaning their poop will take some time. Be careful, Mom. It's great! Poops of gold everywhere. Fortune will come for the third time. You're right. That's a good omen. Then you won't need the washroom anymore. As you wish. - Hey! Is this the mattress you ordered? - Yes, it is! Twenty stories with a broken elevator. This is killing me! Mr. And Mrs. Lui, this is my gift to you for your new home. - Here is your delivery! - Hold on! The dog poop! Now it's really full of poop. License and registration, please. Officer, please give me a chance. Do you write the laws? Do we need laws if I do that? Officer, we're leaving once we move this furniture out. Shut up. License and registration, please. I'm accounting you for another offense. Loitering. - Brother, please-- - I'm not your brother. Don't make any relational claims here. License and registration, please. - Smiley Joe. - Gai. - Are you treating me to tea? - I'm here to check the flat. Check the flat? Gai! Who are these people? Her? A woman. Of course, I know she's a woman. I'm asking who she is to you. No, I mean, this is my woman. My wife. What about her? Well... That's her mom. - You can't live with your mother-in-law. - Wait, no. She's my stepmom. - What about him? - My stepdad. - Stepdad? - Well... My mom passed away, so my dad remarried. Then, my dad died as well. Then, my stepmom remarried to this man. So, he is my stepdad. Then, they gave birth to my little stepsister and stepbrother. She's my little stepsister, and also my wife. So you're committing incest? What do you mean incest? You must be confused. We are all sons of God. If we go by what you say, then the whole world is committing incest. Good grief! If it's too much for you, you should go. Thanks for coming. Bye. Anyway, I don't think we can stay here for long. We'll have to bear with this for a while. Bear with it, and you will find peace. Take a step back, and you will find space. What does that mean? - Don't ask me! Ask Mark. - Bullshit! Mom, I'm going out for dinner with Momo. Don't wait for me. Bye! - What about me? - What are you waiting for? Go after her! Hey! - Smiley Joe, you're amazing! - I'm coming, Mia. Hey! Momo, you bastard. - Stop the car! - That sure took my breath away. Back up. Hop on in, Smiley Joe. Okay. You were so cool just now. I like it. Don't forget this side. Hey! What about me? - You were so mean to him. - Forgive him. I sympathize the feelings of a loser. WINGLEI Just say it if you want money. It's not like I don't have any. Now you've lost a chance to study and got deported. Learning is important, not studying. - He is so stubborn. - A degree is not important. I can't stand him. I'm sorry. It was all because of me. Don't say that! We're a family. Come in. Come in. - Let me help you. - Okay. - Thanks. - Look. Your stepmom and I will sleep in the living room. You two can sleep in the bedroom. All right? Have a seat. Our place is messy and we haven't had time to tidy it up. Dad, since I'm moving back in, will I be bothering you and stepmom? - What? - Once I get myself a job, I'll move out. You're bothering us? Isn't it the other way around? One has to sleep on the top bed and the other on the bottom. Bear with it for now. I bought a flat and we'll move in soon. FOR LEASE PLEASE CALL DAKBO PROPERTY LTD 3-387241 Here we go. Don't move. Good boy. Don't move. That looks awful. Doesn't that hurt? It's okay now. Good boy. I love you. It's your turn now. Come on, don't be afraid. Don't move. Much better now. Why does it look like that? Okay, all done. - It's a good way to make some money. - What? If you donate sperms to a sperm bank, you can make some money. Are you a fish? How much can you make? Even if I agree to it, Loi Dai won't. I'll head over to help. Hey. Girls seem to be very conservative these days, don't you think? Gosh! Gosh. There are two dead koi fish. Wait. Don't throw them away. - What? - Take it over to my wife. Okay. Is that enough, ma'am? - That'll be five dollars, ma'am. - Ma'am. Those fish balls look even better than last time. Of course, those were goldfish fish balls. - Hey, Loi Dai. - Ma'am. They told me to take this over to you. New stuff has arrived! This one is a hot seller. - Is koi fish even edible? - It's delicious! Coffee and milk tea for you, ma'am. - Okay. How much? - Eight dollars. Can you deliver another cup of milk tea, lemon cola, and a toast to the next block? - To your husband at the fish shop? - Yes. All right. Thanks! How would you know what they want to drink, ma'am? Of course I do! He's my husband, silly girl. Hey, man! Your wife told me to send this over to you. Thanks! - Here. How much? - Hi, Wa. - Your wife has paid already. - Really? - Thank you. - Don't mention it. Women are so considerate. I admire that. But if they didn't have us men around, it'd be useless to be considerate. That's right! That's why we have to fulfill our duties as a man. Give them more chances to care for us. Don't waste it. Hey! You were just squeezing out fish eggs. What are you afraid of? It's nourishing. It's like caviar. It costs a few hundred dollars in restaurants. It's not hygienic. You should go wash your hands. Now you're a little more educated, you have so many opinions. Hey! - What? - I need the newspaper. - I'm looking for a job. - You're being good. Loi Dai stopped studying because of me. So I have to earn money to support her education. - Good man! - Yes. It says here that they're hiring young and handsome stunt actors. - Can you do it? - Yes. I'll work like a dog for Loi Dai. You naughty dog, how dare you try to steal my lotus lantern? You did well, Ching Ching. But you need to hit harder. Let's do another take! Work harder. Move! Mr. Lui, the station is still managed by that woman. It's hard for me to help you. I've arranged for her to meet you. Be smart, okay? - Okay. - Who wants to see me, Henry? - Yes, who? - Hi, Ms. Hong. - I see, it's Mr. Lui. - Ms. Hong. Please have a seat. Well, Mr. Lui said he's back to help. You should understand that there's no vacancy at my side. So I can't help him for the time being. Ms. Hong's has authority at the station, Mr. Lui. - She can definitely help you. - Please help me out. So you're looking for a job? That's easy. Just fire this fat man. - That's not right. - He's been working for me for years, but he hasn't done anything right. Today, we're auditioning for horse commentators. - I'm not good at commentating horse races. - It's easy. What's the matter? Are you shy? Just leave it to me! RECORDING IN PROGRESS QUIET PLEASE Go in. Follow me. HORSE RACING WORLD Sit down. DOI LEI SHU, INTERVIEWEE, MO LEONG SHEK Excuse me, is this my seat? Does it look like we have four chairs? This is a horse racing program. Why are you dressed so formally? Exactly! What's up with you? You look like a godfather from Chicago. What's the meaning of this? No, it's not that. I only dressed up as a respect for your program. So now you're saying we don't respect our own program. - Is that it? - No! I've worked in this profession as well. I've been a news presenter for 18 years. That's nothing like commentating horse races. We're all about speed. - It's similar-- - The names of the horses are there. Just start commentating as soon as the race is being shown on the monitor. - Go on. - Can you give me some time to prepare? I'm afraid I can't memorize them all. Other than eloquence, you also need to have a good memory. Hey! Is the clip ready yet? Play it! Hold on! The monitor's too far away. Can you move it closer? Hey! Bring it closer. The stadium's even farther. No need to pull it closer. Just commentate. Roll the clip! Hey! No one can say that but us. The gates just opened, but I haven't said a single word yet. I'm not even ready to start. I'll ask you again. Are you ready now? - Not yet. - That's perfect! Hey! Roll the clip. The gates have opened. The horses are lined up together. I don't even know which one is first. It's all just a bunch of horses running together. I don't know if that's horse number one or seven. There's a batch at the left and right. There's two up ahead in the front and three on its tail. The white horse is going very fast right now. Now the black horse is tightly chasing behind him. Now it's the white horse, black horse, white horse. I don't know its name. Anyway, it's the white horse, black horse, white horse, black horse. Now all the horses have reached the finishing line together. Did I do it right? - I kept commentating the entire time. - That was gibberish. Without saying the horses' names, how would people understand you? I did mention the black and white horses. Let me ask you, what are the black and white horses? What are the batches at the left and right? A batch is-- - Floor manager, escort him out. - Hey. How was I? When will I be notified? Very soon. I'll notify you right away. It's a no. - No? - That's right. You may leave now. Hold on! This is a prop. Lui Tat Piu! Francis! What a surprise! We haven't seen each other for 30 years. So, what were you doing at the station? I was looking for a job. But I messed it up. I'm now the producer at the station. Let me help you out. - Thanks! - You're welcome. Dear, let me do it for you. Behave. We're an old couple. Our children are watching. - Only the baby is here. - You should get to work. Go to work! - What's his name again? - His name is Sam. Sam? What kind of name is that? Right. I've told Loi Dai not to hang around with him. But she wouldn't listen to me. You should be more open-minded. She's an adult woman. I'm going to excuse myself for now. I need to go buy some eggs. I also need to buy some vegetables. - Bye. - That's it for now. Bye. PRICE Ma'am, how much is the choy sum? It's 4.80 dollars. That's expensive. It was only three dollars at Tze Wan Shan before. The housing estates rent has also gone up a lot nowadays. - All right. Give me a pound. - Okay. - That'll be 4.80 dollars. - Make it four dollars. - Give me my change. - You're bargaining over a few cents? Give me some spring onions as a bonus. - These are going to cost you! - Mrs. Lui! I saw your daughter selling fish balls over there. - My daughter? - Yes! It's Loi Dai. Really? Where is she? Over there! I'll show you to her. Don't be so stingy if your daughter is in the business. Loi Dai! - Loi Dai! - Mom! - When did you come back? - A few days ago. I've had trouble looking for you. Why did you give up on your studies and sell fish balls instead? - I... - Selling fish balls is obviously better than studying. What's the matter with you? Is selling fish balls embarrassing? Are you Loi Dai's mom? - Yes. - Yes, I am. - Who is she? - Sam's mom. - Are you still with Sam? - Yes. - Did he steal all the money from you? - No. If he didn't take your money, then why are you selling fish balls? - Exactly! - Don't say that! We make an honest living with our bare hands. We're not liars. Ma'am, please excuse us. You are a grown up now. Since you like him so much, I can't find any reason to object. However, silly girl, why didn't you use the 200,000 dollars I sent you? You don't need to live like this! I want to be independent. I don't want to use the family's money. Since all of this had happened, why don't you have them back? No. If it's given to you, then the money is all yours. We'll ask for it when the family is really in need of it. How's Dad doing? Don't worry about Dad! I'll take care of that for you later. Hey! There's a shriveled lottery ticket. If this ticket won, I'd be more than irritated. Who is it? - It's me, Mrs. Lui! - Mrs. Nam! What a surprise! I was just around the corner, so I thought I'd pay you a visit. - That's thoughtful of you. - Have some apples. How could I? You don't have to come with a present next time. Well, it's my first visit to your new home. - Come in and sit. - Sure! - I'll hang these clothes to dry. - Okay. - Hey. Where's your husband? - Yes? He's back at the station for work. You're really a good wife and mother. To be honest with you, - I feel bad for you. - What's the matter? Last time, when I passed by a big house at Kau To Shan, I saw your husband was smooching another woman. That's nothing. Maybe they were acting for television. What? You're really open-minded. Your husband was holding another woman and you call that acting? Don't you worry about that! He's old. Who'd want him? That's what you think! It's hard to say that about men. Having an affair is not a matter of age or status. It's a human temptation. That's not the case with me. My husband has always treated me well. Has your husband been treating you very well lately? You could say that he has. Then, there's definitely a problem! Let me ask you. How long has it been since you did it? Goodness! We're several decades old. Well, you might not want any, but what about him? No. Since our baby was born, we haven't done it. Exactly! You haven't done it for so long. How else would he resolve that problem? Tell me. That's right! No wonder he was so passionate this morning. I'll be frank with you. Your husband has secretly bought a luxury home, keeps a few pet dogs, and even drives an expensive car. His place is right next to my sister's workplace. And you're being a fool! Do you see anything? Be quiet! I'm looking right now. That bastard! Let me do this. - You're a man. What do you know? - There are some over there. - It stinks. - They came loose. It's fine. I've got an idea. Don't be scared. They're just crabs. I'll tie them up. - There's a basket. Stand on it. - You may be able to, but I can't. All right. Since I'm lighter, I'll stand on it and take a look. - Almost got it! - Almost there! - Great! - Now, I've got you! Hey! How is it? Do you see anything? Lui Tat Piu! - My wife. - Your wife? You jerk! Hey! Aren't you Ngun Mui? Thirty years ago, you were barely 100 pounds. But now, you look like you're more than 100kg. Francis, so you've been trying to seduce my husband all this while. That has never crossed my mind at all. If it hasn't, then why are you doing it? What did I do? What are you doing now? We're just fishing-- Sorry. I have to answer a phone call. You! We'll talk inside! - Hello? - Producer. Our boss was taken in for a chat with the ICAC. I'll be there right away! Ngun Mui, I've got some business to take care of. We'll talk later! I'll see you later. Don't go! You're not going anywhere! Tat Piu, can you give me a lift to the office? Hurry up! We're in a hurry. Sorry, dear. Hey! No! - I can't let you leave, you scumbag! - Take this for me, please. Come back! It's all done. I hope they can be as harmonious as those fish. Now it will be very convenient for the couple. Of course! Both the living room and the bedroom are great. It's practically flawless. Do you think everyone else is just like you? Like father, like son. Smarty-pants. Well, the bed is pretty springy. Of course! It's made of independent springs. Hey! Let's give it a try. - No way! Our son is coming back soon. - What's there to be afraid of? We're legally married. Come on! Hey, Mr. Lui. New Year's just around the corner. You should close the door. A thief could have come in easily. Gai, have you seen my wife? I inspect the housing estate property, not women. Not that. Do you know where my wife could have gone to? Your wife? She probably left with another man. CHEATER - Loi Dai! - What's the matter, Mom? That's your mother-in-law? She's so fat. Don't cry. Have a seat. What happened? - Shut the door first. - Don't cry, Mom. Since we're both women, you can talk to me about it. I'm sorry. I embarrassed myself. It's okay. Just what happened exactly? Dad's having an affair with another woman. Dad has an affair? - I want a divorce. - That's right! Women should be independent. Just like how I sell fish balls for a living. You can join me! - Join you? - That's right! I want to be dependent on my daughter. You've got quite a burden there, kid! Help! I'm on fire! It won't shoot out! Help! - You're fine now. - Are you okay? - Loi Dai. - Dad. NOT A CHEATER Dad, are you still angry at me? Even so, you are still my daughter. Your mom said you got married. How's Sam treating you? He's treating me well. Please don't stay mad at him. Do you know that your mom left? Don't worry. She's staying at my place. She's staying with you? I'll go and pick her up. You shouldn't go now. You know how she is. She's still angry. You should give her some time. Don't worry. Sam and I will take care of her. Without Mom around, nobody is here to take care of you. You should take care of yourself. In a minute, the stuntmen will all be standing there. - Are the paper boxes ready yet? - Of course they're ready! Hey! What's wrong with you? Are you urinating? It's not urine! It's sweat! - Let him down. Hurry up. - Let him down. - Gosh! - It's all set! Ready to roll! Hurry and pull him back up. - Pull him up! - Ready? Slow down! - We're all set. Then let's start filming! - Okay. - Ready! - Ready! Hey! Take off your glasses! Throw it down here! Is it okay, director? - Is it okay? - No problem! - Let's do a better take. - What? The prize is over four million dollars. Buddha, Guanyin, Jesus Christ. Please bless me! Please let me win once more. I'm not greedy. Just once more. You scared me! - Let's go, brother! - Naughty kids. - Okay. - Better pick up the lottery tickets. My goodness. The tickets have gotten so dirty. I wonder if I can claim my prize if I win the lottery. Haven't you scared me enough? I'll knock you out! How dare you scare me like that? Punk! Are you trying to scare me to death? I'll teach you a lesson! I'll beat you up, punk! Let go! If you won't, I will. Mother... Who are you calling mother? You deserved it for scaring me like that! What bad luck! Better pick up the stuff first. Oh no! It's Mom! It must be a robbery. - Let's take the stairs! - Okay. Mom! Mom, are you okay? - It's me! - Mom! Hold on! He sounds familiar. Let's see who it is. Don't you recognize me? Let me wear my glasses. Glasses? It's me, Sam! - It does look like him. - It does. The first of the winning lottery numbers for this drawing is 23. 23. - Our second winning number is 29. - 29. The third number is 38. - 38. - The fourth number is 34. Good evening. The interest rates... Mom, the baby peed in his diapers. Pipe down! Mom's winning for sure. Loi Dai, the baby peed in his diapers. Why don't you change his diapers? Okay. One. Two. Three. Please let me win! Let me win! Hey. Mom, it's time for dinner! This is the last one. It has to be it! Just win! - What happened, Mom? - What happened, Mom? It's nothing. Let's eat. And so, Snow White and the prince lived happily ever after. That's a lie. That's right, Chiu Dai. Fairy tales are a fiction. But it brings us hope. It's just like drawing a cookie to fill starvation. Even though we know it's fake, but for starving people, it's better than nothing at all, right? That's why fantasies and hope can still bring people happiness. Today's first winning lottery number is 3. - 3. - The second number is 24. The third number is 16. The fourth number is 23. The fifth number is 26. The sixth number is 8. The special bonus number is 42. 42. Bless me. For the stock market news... Mom, let me help you. Don't be nosy. This is an adult's business. Mom, you dropped a lottery ticket. I'll pick it up for you. Mom. - Move it. - I'll go take a look at the baby. A loss. Another loss. Number 3, 16, 23, 24, 8, 26, and 42! This is great! I won! I'm rich! I've got to keep this a secret no matter what. NOT A CHEATER Are you a relative of Ng Ngun Mui? She's arrested for faking a lottery ticket and is now at the police station. Dear! Your wife is in there. You may get off the car now. - How may I help you? - Officer. Dad! You wait here. I'll go and do the paperwork. Why are you so late? What happened exactly? It's a big mess! - What big mess? - Mamma Mia counterfeited a lottery ticket. And yet, she's fine. Isn't that a big mess? - Then, there's no problem. - Not exactly. It's a smaller mess. There's a big-time lawyer in there. So there probably wouldn't be any problems. It's fine for now. But it may not be in a while. But I don't know if it'll be fine or not. So is there a problem or not? None of my business. Is Mom okay? Tat Piu, it's fine now. It's just a practical joke from a child, Ngun Mui. It'll be okay after a slight warning. Thank you. - I'll step out first. - Thanks. - Dear! - It's fine now. - I'll have my lawyer settle the case. - Thank you. - Gosh. - Chiu Dai! I'm fine, Dad. Mom. I'm sorry, Mom. Silly girl, how can I blame you for this? - Just don't be so naughty again. - Ng Ngun Mui, you may go now. Little girl, have a seat and give with your statement. It's all my fault, dear. Let's go home together and talk it out. Then, will you go see Francis again? - Francis-- - Ngun Mui. If you don't want Tat Piu to be seeing me every day, why don't I recommend him to a job at a TV station in Macau? Macau? What's the job? Dog race commentator. Great! Dog number five, Nerve Wizard, is a British dog. Dog number two, Great Fortune, is from France. Dog number four, Vigorous Life, is from Italy. - Next, we have Hundred Steps. - What's the dog from Hong Kong called? A Yes-Man. This is too much. I can't tell them apart. Sir, if you don't recognize these dogs, how can you commentate the races? Let them do the talking! Smiley Joe, remember to mop the floors once you finish cleaning the washroom. - What are you chatting about? - None of your business. Hey. Between those two, who do you like more? I like them both. So you don't like either of them. Not exactly. If I give up on either of them, they'll be in pain and I will be in pain as well. Actually, Momo's not bad. He's honest. Yes, he's honest but he's very boring. Smiley Joe is fun to be with. That's right! But he can get very flirtatious. If I were you, I'd pick neither of them. - What does it have to do with you, kid? - Exactly! You think you're great? Why are you so angry? It's all the fault of you men. How am I involved? It's the same for you! What's the same? Hey. She said you look ugly. You should wash your face with pomelo skin. What? Who needs pomelo skin? I have some here! Sam needs it. He said he looks ugly. It's close to New Year. It's a bad time to talk like that. That won't matter. He'll be fine in a few days. It'll be New Year in a few days. - He'll definitely be fine. - Really? - You know fortune-telling? - A little. - I'll share a few predictions for you. - What? I say you're a real bitch. - What? - No. I'm saying you're a rich bitch. - That sounds more like it! - You like that? Also, you've come to Macau for 28 days. Today's the 28th of the lunar calendar. It means good fortune. Not only that, but your glasses look like the number eight. - Right? - Yes. Also, your mandarin tree has a total of 38 mandarin oranges. Your peach blossom has 88 flowers. This entire place is filled with the number eight. You'll be rich! - Wow! You're pretty nosy. - Well, of course. All right. Just as long as everybody gets rich. Let's clean up now. Tat Pui is coming back for dinner. - I'm back! - Dad! - Dad. - Dad. - Get a bowl of soup for Dad. - There's no need. I'm going to sleep. Go and do your homework. Okay. What's the matter? - He was bullied by the dogs. - What? Did he get bitten? No, he couldn't remember the names of the dogs. He just couldn't tell them apart. Why are your eyes so big and mine so small? Dear, didn't you say you were going to sleep? Go rest. Let me hold the baby. Here, boy. Let me hold you. Good boy. Is the job tiring you out? Tired? This job is killing me with boredom. Jobs are like that. Here's my salary. It's 8,800 dollars. What? 8,800 dollars? What a coincidence. Maybe it really is a good omen. I won! Place your bet. I'll bet more. Number eight. I'm rich! I won again. SMALL, BIG, BIG I'll go all-in! - Of course! - I have to win! - Number eight! - Number eight! - Number eight! - Number eight! Number eight! I'm rich! Ma'am, it's not 8. It's 18. Three sixes, three of a kind. You lost. It's your turn. That's so big. Hey. Where did your mom go? I don't know. - Hey! - It's my turn! I'm waiting for her to go to the flower market. Where is she? There she is! I'm from Dai Fung Bank. Is Mrs. Lui here? She's not here. Where did Mom go? Tell us! - Tell us! - She went to Casino Lisboa. - What? Lisboa? - What? Lisboa? What about me, Dad? You can't go in. Just wait for me here. - Just shout if you need help. - Okay. Good girl. Let's look over there. I can't do this. I need to borrow money. Did you see what happened? What a joke. Dad, come out! - What's the matter? - I found Mom! - Where? - By the sea. Quick! Chiu Dai, wait for me. Mom! Are you all right? - Mom lost all your lucky money. - Dear. Dear, I'm so sorry. I've even lost your salary. Don't cry. Why did you go out to gamble? I see that you are tired because of work, so I wanted to take a risk. What risk? People say if the poor gamble, they will make a fortune. That saying is wrong. The poor should avoid gambling. Gambling only makes you poorer. We must live an honest life. - Understand? - Yes. Hey! Why are you still playing here? I won a lot of money here. Let me play one last time. They're over there. - Let's go. - Loi Dai! Loi Dai, did you see Mom? What? What did you say? Are you all right? - You hit the jackpot! - You're rich! We won big! There's over three million dollars jackpot winnings. We're rich! Someone came to look for you today. - Really? Who was it? - Smiley Joe! - It was something about... - Mamma Mia! - What is it? - Loi Dai just hit the jackpot! - The jackpot? - What? Congratulations, miss. You've won the jackpot prize money of over three million dollars. - Please hand out your identity card. - Excuse me. - We'll arrange the money for you. - Loi Dai! Mom, I hit the jackpot. - It's over three million dollars! - Is this true, Loi Dai? This is great! - There's something even better. - What is it? Mrs. Lui. On the day that the bank was robbed, we couldn't find any document of your withdrawal of the 30 million dollars. So we came to the conclusion that the loss was our fault. The insurance company has compensated the money back to our bank. Now, we're returning the money to you. Great. Thanks. Dear, we are so lucky. Our money was gone, but it came back to us. Dear, remember this. Even as rich people, we should be humble and never be show-offs. We're really lucky to have regained our loss. From now on, we should live in harmony. Now, that's the real fortune! That's right! Subtitle translation by Juno Mak
