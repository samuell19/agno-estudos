Grace? Grace? Grace, come to me. Grace. Yes, I'm coming. Grace, come to me. Yes. I'm, I'm coming. Where are you? I'm here. What do you want? Why can't you just leave me alone? - Well, here we are, Anna. - Thanks for the ride. Don't even think about it. You know I'd do anything for you. You've done enough already, Dr. Shaw. Anna, I want you to stop thinking about me as your doctor. I'm also your friend. I've always been your friend. - I know. - Your father and I were very close. It was only right that I be the one who looked after you. And I appreciate that. I'm sure my father's estate took very good care of you, as well. Anna, I want nothing more than for you to be happy. You're a wealthy girl. You barely know this man. Well, I'm hoping you didn't rush into this marriage. And what if I did? You could get hurt. Thanks for your concern, but I'm no longer a patient. First time on the island? Yes. I heard it's a great place. And it's certainly isolated. Not a lot for a young lady to do there. Ah, I don't mind. I have plenty to keep me busy. You didn't rent a car? No, I'm being picked up. I'm moving here. I'm Mrs. Richard Palmer. I imagine you're going up the, uh, lighthouse at Shorecliff. Yes. I've seen pictures. I think I'm already falling in love with it. That's good. That place could use some love. Hi, this is Richard. I can't come to the phone right now. Please leave your name and number, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Hey, hon, it's me. Um, I'm here on the island and I... I don't see you anywhere. Can you please give me a call as soon as possible? You havin' some trouble? I just don't know where my husband is. Ah, I'm sure he'll be along shortly. I hope so. Uh, is there any place I can go to get out of this cold? Yeah. Yeah, The, uh, Sail Croft. About a block up the road. I'll tell you what, I'll leave word with the guys. If your husband shows up, we'll tell him that's where you're at. Well, thank you. Here. Oh, no, no, no. That's not necessary. No, please, you guys have a drink on me. It's chilly. All right. But you didn't have to. Mornin', miss. Can I just get a cup of hot tea? Hot tea. You expecting anyone else? My husband. But I don't know if he'll be wanting anything. Well, who's your husband? Richard Palmer. I heard he got remarried recently. So I heard. I'm so sorry. I'm Carrie. Anna. - Let me get that tea for you. - Thank you. Hi, this is Richard. I can't come to the phone right now. Please leave your name and number, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. No luck, still? It just keeps going straight to voicemail. I don't know what happened. Do you need a ride to Shorecliff? I don't know, I should probably just stay put and wait here for him. Well, you let me know if you change your mind. And thank you for the drink. - You're welcome. - Irish coffee. Who was that? Richard! Where have you been? I thought you forgot all about me. Oh, the car wouldn't start. Might be something to do with the ignition. It's okay. You're here now. Here's your tea. Um, can I actually get that to go, please? Sure thing. - Thank you. - You can enjoy your tea. There's no rush. That's all right. I'm just really anxious to see Shorecliff. I'll bet you are. Hey, who's that guy you were talking to? How's the weather out there? He's the captain of the ferry. Uh, Captain Hanson. Oh. Captain Hanson. That's right. Thank you, Carrie. I'll get your bags. - Thanks, honey. - Let's go, sweetie. Welcome to Shorecliff. Oh! Is it anything like you imagined it would be? No, it's... It's much grander. Grander? You should reserve your judgement until you've been inside. It doesn't matter what it looks like inside. It's my new home. Our new home, where we're gonna start our life together. It's absolutely perfect. Well, maybe you'd like to see the island from the top of the light. It's an amazing view. No. No, thank you. I don't like closed spaces. I thought I told you that. Oh, that's right. You did tell me. No closed spaces. I'm sorry, I forgot. Hmm. Well, let's get you inside before you blow away. - Okay. - Come on. There. Now, it's all official. I love you, Richard. I love you, too, Mrs. Palmer. Oh! So sweet. - Come on, let me show you the house. - Oh! What do you think? - It's beautiful. - Come on in here. Oh! It's incredible. You like it? Yes, of course. My great-great-grandfather founded this island when he took on the task of lighthouse-keeping back in 1875. And what is this room? Well, this is my study. This is where I write. It's my private space where I grind out all my books. Oh, so I'm guessing I won't be allowed in here very much, then. No. But once you see the living room, you won't wanna hang out in here, anyway. Come on. And this is the main room. Nothing's been changed in here in almost a hundred years. Even the drapes? That's right. Look, I'm gonna take your bags upstairs. Why don't you take a look around your new house and see if the mistress approves? You are so beautiful. I think you would look good over here, by the ship. Right there. That way, if you wanna go back to the sea, you can just hop on board. That's better, isn't it? Mrs. Palmer would never approve of moving that. I'm sorry, I didn't hear anyone come in. She used to sit here and play every night before supper. She was quite accomplished. She liked her mermaid close by. She liked to feel the delicate features. So, you can understand why she wouldn't want it moved, can't you? I'm sorry, I didn't know. - Anna. - Mrs. Argyle. I take care of the house. I wouldn't want to be any trouble, Mrs. Argyle. As you can see... You're not blind. I couldn't help but notice. I didn't mean it like that. Mrs. Palmer may have been blind in the conventional sense, but she... I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude, but I am Mrs. Palmer. Of course, you are. Lunch is ready, Mrs. Palmer. Dinner is at 7:00. 7:00, sharp. I leave at 7:30. I'll be sure to keep an eye on the time. Mrs... Grace appreciated routine. It became her inner clock. She never missed a thing. She was never late. She appreciated routine. Mr. Palmer does, as well. It made their world run smoothly. How did she die? Perhaps, you should ask your husband. I just keep the house. Ah, there you are. I met Mrs. Argyle. Oh. I hope she didn't scare you. She has that effect on people. Well, she was a bit intimidating at first, but I'm sure we'll get along just fine. Good. Turkey again. It's always turkey. You think we could have something different once in a while. Don't you like routine? Routine? No, I hate it. Who wants the same old thing every day? Who indeed? Listen, uh, don't worry about Mrs. Argyle, okay? I mean, she creeps around this place like a ghost from the 19th century. She's harmless. I'm not worried. I saw you speaking to someone outside. Oh, that. Yeah. I... I needed to order a part for the car. Um, we have a mechanic on the island, but no parts. Everything has to be brought in from the mainland. That's a drag. Yeah. You get used to it. I just hope it gets here before the car decides to crap out entirely. Where are you going? Ah, so many questions today. I have to go work on my book. I have some story points I need to hammer out before I lose my train of thought. Can't that wait until tomorrow? I just got here. I know. But, no, it won't. Everything is in my head. And if I don't strike now, I'll forget it later. Why don't you unpack your things and have a rest? The first bedroom on the right, up the stairs. I'll be done soon enough. All right. Mrs. Grace never questioned her husband. She knew how important his work was. Mrs. Argyle, if you don't mind, I'm a little tired. Good day, Mrs. Palmer. Who's there? Well, you must've been tired. Why didn't you wake me up? I thought you could use your rest. I mean, it's been a pretty long day, what, with the ferry ride and all. It's after 8:00. Dinner's gone by, and sweet old Mrs. Argyle never stays past 7:30. But there is a plate in the oven for you. And I also opened a bottle of wine for you. It's by the window. Thank you. Hey, honey, before I came downstairs, I thought I heard the strangest noise from outside the room. It was a sort of tapping sound. Well, this house is almost 200 years old. I think it's entitled to a few strange sounds now and again. Go eat your dinner. Good morning, Mrs. Palmer. Good morning. Your breakfast is in the oven. Thank you. I'm sorry, you slept later than I'm used to. Eggs do not reheat well. That's all right, I'm not very hungry. I can make breakfast later than I normally do, if that's what you'd like. Don't change anything on my account. I don't usually sleep this late, I just zoned out last night. Whatever you say. Do you know where Richard is? Mr. Palmer had breakfast at 8:00 a.m. He's working now. Then I won't bother him. That would be best. Ah! That didn't take long. Well, you know how Harold can get to talking. I figured I'd better get out of there before he started in on how bad the drugstore business has been. People just aren't getting sick fast enough to suit him, I guess. He is the only man I know who gets excited when flu season rolls around. Oh... I stopped by The Sail Croft for a coffee. And that waitress, Carrie, said that Richard Palmer's new wife had arrived. New wife? Well, that didn't take long. It must be a very lonely life in that lighthouse. But just the same, you think he could've waited a little while. Oh, no. I can't agree. I'm glad he married again. A man needs a wife. Hmm. Wonder what she's like. Carrie said she was very pretty. And very young. Well, I can imagine. And I suppose you're anxious to run over there and have a look at her. Well, Mrs. Argyle did say she put together a package for the rummage sale. Someone has to get it. Oh, all right, but you hurry back. We've got a lot of other pick-ups to do, you know? I'll report back as soon as I can. Oh! Get... Hello. Hello. So, what a windy day it is, huh? I'm sorry, can I help you? Oh. Well, yes, uh, I believe so. Are you Mrs. Palmer? Yes, I am. Anna Palmer. Ah, Anna. What a pretty name. I'm the Reverend Samuel Thomas. I heard in town that Richard had taken himself a new bride, and I simply had to introduce myself. Well, it's nice of you to ride your bike all the way here just to meet me. Oh, it's no trouble at all. Riding the old bike is very therapeutic and I need the exercise. Or so my wife keeps telling me. Besides, I believe, Mrs. Argyle had collected a bundle of donations for our church's annual rummage sale that I would love to pick up. Mmm-hmm. A bundle? I think I know what you're talking about. Would you like to come inside for a cup of tea or coffee? - That would be very nice. - Oh. Okay. I see you're catching up on your husband's literary work. Ah! Yes. - Thank you. - Oh. Pretty As Poison. Where does he come up with these plots? Yeah, who knows? But people buy them. Deception, betrayal, and good old-fashioned murder. What a funny way to make a living. Is he working on anything new at the moment? Oh, yes, of course, but it's a big secret. Ah. He won't talk about it, huh? Not even a peep. Well, Richard's always been on the quiet side. How long have you known him? Oh. Uh, since he was a teenager, I guess. How long have you known him? I'm a bit embarrassed to say, but it's only been three months. Three months? It must have been a case of love at first sight, huh? Oh, I've never felt so pursued in my life. He absolutely wouldn't take no for an answer. He just had to marry me. Then it must be love. Well, I hope you'll be very happy here. Thank you. Let me go get that bundle for you. Oh, thank you. All right, here it is. Oh, yes. Some of Grace's things, I believe. Very thoughtful of you people. She was such a lovely lady. She had such nice things. What was she like? Well, uh, when we first met, she was very sweet, very kind. So full of life, always smiling. Generous to a fault. And then... Well... Well, what? Well, the illness. If it wasn't for Mrs. Argyle, who knows how long poor Grace would've lasted here. What happened to her? She fell from the tower platform one night. No one knows why she was even up there at all, but she fell, or so they believe. Richard was out of town at the time, so she wasn't missed till the next morning. Is she buried nearby? She's not buried at all. They never found her body. Only her cane. Well, uh... Good day to you, Mrs. Palmer. And thank you. Reverend, could I invite you to dinner tonight? Tonight? I'm sure Richard would love to see you and your wife. Uh, well, uh... I guess it would be impolite to pass on such a generous invitation. Okay, great. Dinner will be at 7:00 p.m., sharp. 7:00 it is. We'll try not to be late. Okay. Look, I told you I can't come up with all of it right now. Well, of course, you'll get it. It might just take me another week. Yes, I understand. No, I'm not looking for any trouble. All... All right. Well, of course. As soon as I can. - I have to go in to town, honey. - Oh, can I come with? Ah, not this time, sweetheart. It's kind of a private matter. Something you can't share with me? Uh, it's... It's not that. It's just... You see, I was expecting a check from my publisher, and it hasn't arrived. Now, I need to go see someone at the bank and straighten out a few things. Why didn't you just say so? I can write you a check until yours comes in. It's okay. I wouldn't want to touch your inheritance. That would not be right. No, I'll deal with this on my own. I'll think of something. Don't be like that. I'm your wife. Let me help you. What good is money if you don't do something good with it? Well, I, I really shouldn't. But it would only be for a week, at the most. Are you sure? - Of course. Let's go get my checkbook. - Great. How much do we need? Five thousand dollars. Okay. Five thousand dollars. Don't put my name on it. Just, uh, leave it blank. Why? Well, I'm not sure which of the accounts I need to put it in to until I meet with the bank manager. Oh, okay. All right. Be careful. If this thing gets lost... Don't worry. I'll take good care of it. Honey, I invited the Reverend Thomas and his wife to dinner tonight. You did what? Well, he came by earlier today, and he was so nice, and I don't really have any friends here yet, so... No. Of course, there's no... It's no problem. It's fine. Really, it is. Just, uh, let Mrs. Argyle know, and I'll be home soon. - You have my money! - Yes. I have your money, all right? - All of it this time? - I don't have all of it. I told you, another week. You need another week? I have been waiting as it is. I want that money right now! Here! I'll have the rest for you later. Okay. I brought you some fresh towels. Thank you. What a pretty dress. Thank you. I wanted to look nice for Richard. I'm sure he'll approve. Where's your jewelry? It's on the mainland with the rest of my things. Maybe in a week or two. You should wear this. It's stunning. It's an old family heirloom. Do you think Richard would like it? I know he would. It's perfect. It's amazing how well you've managed to maintain the original integrity of this old house, Richard. Most people would have modernized the whole interior ages ago. I'd love to, but that would require some financial resources that are beyond my means at the moment. And besides, the Historical Society is pretty intent on us not changing anything. I imagine it looks very much like it did when your great-great-grandfather, Captain Palmer, first settled the island. There have been some improvements to be sure, but not too many in the last 50 years. What does Anna think of all this? It must be quite a change for someone from the mainland. It'll take her a little while to adjust, but she'll be fine. What's keeping your young bride? Well, I'm sure she's still upstairs getting dressed. She'll be down in a minute. Why don't I go up and see if she needs any help? You know how women can be. Everything has to be perfect, right down to the smallest detail. Top of the stairs, first door on the right. Emma's right, you know. It's a wonder we ever get out of the house at all. Too true. Cheers. Come in. - Anna? - Yes? I'm Emma. Reverend Thomas's wife. I'm sorry, Mrs. Thomas. I invited you to dinner and I've been a terrible hostess. Oh, don't be silly. I just came up to see if I could help you. Ah, I'm all done. Oh, what a lovely necklace! Thank you. Why don't we go downstairs? I'm starving. Me, too. Nevertheless, you've done a wonderful job of doing almost nothing at all. In fact, the less you do, the better things seem to turn out. Believe me, Reverend, it was easy. Good evening, Reverend. Ah! You look lovely. Don't you just love it? I wore it just for you. How dare you? What are you doing? - What? I thought... - Take it off. Richard... Don't just stand there. I said, take that thing off! Dinner's served. But you, you said... But... I'll clean up in the morning. What are you waiting for? Get out! Get out! Oh! He loves me. I know he loves me. He just doesn't know how to show it. He will, soon. He has to. I'm, uh, so sorry about what just happened. I mean, I let my emotions get the better of me. Seeing Anna wearing Grace's necklace, I... I just lost it. Please don't feel like you have to leave. I... I'll go talk to her. Under the circumstances, uh, I think it would be best that we go. You and Anna need some alone time together. Trust me, Richard, she meant no harm. I'm sure she didn't even realize. I know. Uh, you're right. And it's all my fault. Well, thank you for coming, and have a good night. Goodnight, Richard. Oh, and don't forget. The church rummage sale is tomorrow. We hope to see you there. Don't worry. We'll be there. Well, that went well. What are you doing here? Don't get cute with me, Richard. Everybody's talking about your new little wife. I just wanted to see her for myself. Besides, in case you forgot, you do what I tell you to. What do you think? I don't think we have anything to worry about. Richard? Honey? Richard? Honey, are you up there? Hey, open up the door! Somebody help me! Get me out of here! Open this door! Anna! Anna, are you all right? Hell, no, I'm not all right! There's someone in there. - In where? - In the tower. - That can't be. - There's someone in there. - And someone locked that door. - All right. Just calm down and wait here. Well? The door just got stuck. It does that sometimes. You just have to push on it really hard. Did you go all the way to the top? No, I didn't need to. I could see there wasn't anyone up there. Did you check the platform? Would you like to go up there and check for yourself? You know I can't do that. Well, then, you're gonna have to take my word for it, honey. Look, you're upset. Let me fix you a drink. Come on. Here you go, sweetheart. Thank God you heard me. Well, why were you even in the tower to begin with? I was looking for you. I heard that noise again. What noise? That tapping sound from last night. Where were you? I was... I was ashamed of my behavior earlier this evening. I made a fool of myself and I hurt you. I couldn't face you. I went to the study to clean up some of my notes, and I... I guess I fell asleep in the chair. There is someone else in this house. Anna, please. No, I'm being serious. All right. Was it a man or a woman? I don't know. I couldn't tell. Sweetheart, you'd make a lousy witness. Now, let's get you back to bed. I'm not going to sleep. All right, you can read a book. Come on. Let's go. You don't believe me, do you? It's not that I don't believe you, sweetheart, it's just... There's only one way in or out of that tower and that's through the house itself. And we're alone here. But that tapping sound, I... I need you to believe me. All right, look, let's try something. Close your eyes. All right, they're closed. Now what? Just keep them closed. Keep them closed. Did it sound like this? Yes. That's exactly the sound. Look. It's one of Grace's old canes. It was hanging in the closet. And you know how drafty this house can be. It was hanging from the, hook, probably just swinging and hitting the sides. I don't believe that. Suit yourself. Good morning, Mrs. Palmer. You set me up last night. I don't know what you're talking about. You talked me into wearing that necklace. Her necklace! You knew how upset he would be. You knew how he would react! As far as I know, the necklace is just an old piece of jewelry. I didn't mean to cause you any trouble. The missus used to wear it all the time with no problem. I'm sure. And what about this? Where did you get that? Richard. He found it in the bedroom closet. He knew it was there, and so did you. Ms. Grace had several canes. Well, someone's been using it around the house at night and I don't like it. You hear the cane? Every night since I've arrived. And I want it to stop. Do you understand me? Of course, I do. But I'm not here at night, remember? Hello? Anna. This is Dr. Shaw. Dr. Shaw? Yes. I was just wondering how you're getting on. Yeah, I... I'm fine. Anna? Hello? Hi, sweetie. Listen, um, the church is having its annual rummage sale today, and I thought, uh, maybe you'd like to go? Especially since I already promised them we'd come. I'd love to get out of the house for a while. Great! I'll get the car started and all warmed up for you. Ah! Hi, good to see you. Sorry, Reverend. Ah, you like this one, huh? - I think it's cool, right? - And don't forget that one, too. Hmm. Sales are brisk. You've done it again, Emma. Mmm, don't count your chickens yet. Look who just walked in. Here you go. Oh, first time he's been to church in ages. I know. But remember, you're not handing out sermons today. You're selling them. - Oh, it's the pastor. - Anna, how nice you two could stop by. I have to apologize for last night. I'm afraid I ruined everything. Oh, no. That's... It's all my fault. Let's not talk about last night. It's all in the past. Let me show you around. Maybe you'll see something you like. - Okay. - You don't mind, do you? Uh, no. You go right ahead. You two have fun. Hmm. Good to see you in church, Richard. Now, don't you start in on me, Reverend. Oh, I wouldn't dream of it. But thanks for coming, just the same. Well... So, what have you got on tap this year? Let me show you the new fishing rods that Jimmy's Sporting Goods donated. Love to see 'em. There are some lovely items here if you're looking to find something to add a little color to your house. It sure needs it. Don't get me wrong, it's an amazing place, but it's a bit dreary, if you know what I mean. I do. Those historical landmarks can be pretty colorless. Well, have a look around, see if anything catches your eye. Every dollar goes to a small recreation program for the kids. Thank you. I'm sure I'll find something. This is a nice piece. Don't you think? I'm sorry. I forgot your name. Carrie. Carrie. That's right. From Sail Croft. Yeah. Cute, huh? It sure is. It's cheap, too. That's okay. I really don't have any place to display it. But it is nice. Well, if you really don't want it, maybe I'll get it. You should. It'd look great on a bookcase somewhere. And you can't beat the price. I know just what to do with it. Very cool. Well, have fun. Thank you. - Huh? - Okay, see you later. Hey, honey. Look at this rod and reel. I'm thinking of buying it. You totally should. Let's get you out of that study and keep you company. I never scared off a fish in my life. I wanna buy this. Isn't it darling? You can't buy that. What do you mean? It's only three dollars. Anna, that horse belonged to Grace. That's one of the items I donated to the rummage sale. Oh. I don't want that in the house. I got rid of those things for a reason. I'm sorry, honey. I... I didn't know. Look, if you want me to believe you, you're gonna have to stop doing these things. You can't be mad at me. You're the one who gave Reverend Thomas the stuff for the rummage sale, aren't you? Aren't you? Yes, but Mrs. Argyle was the one that packed everything. - I didn't even know what was in there. - All right. All right. Let's... Well, maybe we should just go home now. It's almost noon and I have a lot of work to do today. Are you ready? I... I guess so. Let's just... Let's just go. - Hi. - Hi. - Can I help you? - Is Richard at home? Yes. Come in. He's in his study right now, and he doesn't like to be bothered while he's working, so maybe I could just tell him what you wanted? Of course. You're Anna, right? I am. Have we met? Not yet. I'm Beth. I heard there was a new face here in Shorecliff, and I, for one, am very glad. This place needs a breath of fresh air. Thank you. Just, uh, tell Rich I'm here. He's expecting me. Okay. Just wait right here. Surprised to see you're still hanging around here. Very surprised. Beth, I'm so glad you could make it today. I answer the call of my master's voice. Beth is my transcriber. She types up all those scribbled pages I crank out and turns them into something a publisher will buy. We've been a team for years now. Well, today is full of surprises. Let me help you set up. We've got a lot to plough through today. It was nice meeting you. Same here. She certainly seems to have recovered from last night. Well, don't count on it. She's as jumpy as a cat, and it's only getting worse. You need to push her along a little faster, Richard. But this has to be set up very carefully. I know. It has to be airtight. Oh, it will be. She's already convinced someone's out to get her. You have to get rid of her, Richard... For good. No, I don't. Look, she's worth two million dollars alive. All I have to do is to get them to put her back in the hospital, and then, as her husband, I have complete control of her bank account. When will that happen? Aw, we can't rush it, baby. She just got here, you know? Well... Don't try and double-cross me, Richard. That would be a very... bad idea. Remember, I actually do know where the bodies are buried. Richard! Richard? Richard, I saw them. Richard! Anna! What's the matter with you? Oh, my God, Beth. Oh, my God, Beth, is right. You look like you were about to jump. Don't... Don't say that. I'm just a little dizzy. I thought I saw someone up here. You did. You saw me. You ready to go back down now? Yes. Come on, then. Richard said you were claustrophobic. So, what the hell were you doing up in the tower? Well, the strangest things keep happening around here and I thought that maybe I could get to the bottom of it. Well, Richard got a call and had to go into town. He needed to pick up some supplies. Whenever I need a break, I go up to the tower platform. Did you know Grace? Uh, as well as anyone could, I guess. She never really talked to me much. Was she always blind? No. No, she wasn't. Uh, Grace suffered from hypertension which brought on a bout of ischemia. It was all pretty sudden. It cost her her eyesight. Richard must have loved her very much. Yeah. Yeah, he did. But, uh, people find a way to move on, to love again. He's a complicated man. But he's been so patient with me. I mean, we barely know each other, and I've been acting a little crazy. Let's not tell him about today. It'll be our little secret. Better not season the pot. I think you're right. That's Richard. I should go help with the supplies. - I can do that. - No, no, no. Um... That's what I get paid for. You wouldn't wanna make me seem irrelevant, would you? I definitely need this job. Of course not. "Stepping out onto the cold, metal platform," she could feel a frigid shroud of darkness wrap itself around her body. "As the cruel wind whipped across her sightless eye..." Oh, my God. Anna, what are you doing in here? You're using your wife's death as the subject of your story? This is awful! Anna, please. Dinner's ready. Would you like me to take a plate to Mrs. Palmer? No, I'll do it. I'm sorry about the extra work. Anna's not feeling well this evening. Will there be anything else? No. Just put my plate in the oven. I'll have it later. Yes, sir. Oh, hey. Hey. Dinner in bed? A peace offering. You should've seen her today at the top of the tower. She was at the top of the tower? She was almost ready to fall over the edge. It would've been so easy. Just a little push. Don't even think about it. I just need to have her put away for a little while. As long as she's alive, we have nothing to worry about. Don't look at me. But it was awfully tempting. The crazier she acts, the better. Well, keep working on her. I will. I'll see you later? You can bet on it. Sweetie, I brought your dinner. I'm not hungry. Sweetie, you need to eat something. Richard, how could you? How could you use your wife's death as part of your book? All right, look. I want you to go through this new draft of my manuscript, all right? Now, nowhere in there do I even remotely describe anything related to Grace's death. I know you're upset, but I don't know what you're talking about. I know what I read. Then, show me. You must have just taken it out. I did not. And I am not gonna sit here and have you accuse me of this. Frankly, I think your imagination's gotten the better of you. I'll be right back. - Dr. Shaw? - Yes. - Welcome. - Are you Richard? Yes. Please come in. Mmm. This way, please. I really appreciate you coming out on such short notice. And I know Anna will, too. I caught the afternoon ferry right after we spoke. I tried to call her earlier, but I had a little trouble getting through. Thank you. You know, Anna means the world to me. I take it there has been some sort of problem? Well, maybe. I'm not sure. She's been acting out of sorts since she came to live here. And I really don't know how to explain it. Try. Okay. Um... I think she might be having some sort of emotional breakdown. I was afraid of something like this. She's... Well, she imagines things. She hears things. She's absolutely convinced there's someone roaming around the house. Just today, she accused me of some ridiculous crap that, frankly, has me questioning her ability to think straight. How much has she told you about her past issues? Well, not much. Um, I know her parents died in a fire some years ago and that she was raised by the state. State hospital. Anything else? Well, I know she came into a bit of money and she took a trip to the casino. That's where I first met her. And you got my number from one of her prescription bottles? Yes. Now, look. I know I shouldn't have been snooping around in her stuff, but I'm just really worried about her. Anna's parents died in a freak fire when she was very young. No one was sure of how it happened, but the police were convinced that Anna had somehow killed her parents. She was a minor, no real evidence. So charges were never filed. In the hospital, she withdrew into a deep shell that I spent years trying to pull her out of. When she turned 21, her trust fund kicked in and the state released her. I was a little concerned when I'd heard she was getting married. I wasn't really sure if she was ready for anything like this. Well, maybe she's not. Can I see her now? Sure. I'll ask her to come down. Someone to see you. It's a surprise. Anna, look who's come to see you. Dr. Shaw? Good evening, Anna. What is he doing here? I came to see how you're doing. Would you like to sit down? Can we have a few minutes alone? Of course. You don't look very happy to see me. Richard called you? He did. What did he tell you? Not much. He's just worried about you. I am, too. So, Anna, tell me what's going on. Someone doesn't want me in this house. Someone wants me gone. Why do you say that? I know it sounds crazy, but someone's trying to drive me out of here. But who would do that? Ah... I don't know. Maybe, maybe the housekeeper, Mrs. Argyle. She was devoted to Richard's former wife and she hates me. Do you want me to talk to her? No, she's never here at night, which would make it perfect, because she's never here when these things are happening. You might be right. What about your husband? Where is he when all this is going on? He's never around, either. Well? You were right to call me. What's wrong? Anna's in a very fragile state right now. Her imagination seems to be hyperactive, maybe even to a dangerous level. Why... Why dangerous? Nobody's really sure whether Anna deliberately killed her parents or not, but it did have a profound effect on her. That, coupled with the fact that she inherited a small fortune as a result of their tragedy, makes her feel even more guilty. When you met her, she was on an uncontrolled downward spiral. I was very nervous when she told me she was getting married. And her problems seemed to have followed her here. That's a lot to suppose. I don't have any other explanation for it. Unless there really is someone here who's trying to frighten her. Well, I think I would know. So, now what? Have her get these filled tomorrow. I can't promise they'll solve her problems, but they might help her calm down a bit. Just be careful how she uses them. And what if these don't help? I don't wanna guess. But if they don't, she'll have to come back to the mainland for a while where I can watch her more closely. We don't want these delusions to turn in to something more serious. All right. Well, I'll get these filled for her. No, she's gonna have to show up in person to get those scripts filled. They're controlled substances. All right, Doctor, thank you. And I hope you're wrong about her trying to hurt herself. Just keep a close eye on her. And whatever you do, don't leave her alone for too long. Oh, don't worry. I won't leave her alone for a minute. Honey, I'm sorry. I've got to leave the island for a day. But I'll be back tomorrow. What? I've got to go. There's a publisher's meeting that suddenly came up and I've got to be there. It's very important. Is this about the check that didn't come? Uh, that, and the fact that I've missed my deadline. But you don't need to worry about that. Everything will be fine. This is all my fault. How can it be your fault? There isn't a problem. Really. Now, Dr. Shaw said you have to get these filled yourself. Oh. Look, why don't you drop me off in town, and then you can do a little shopping while you get your prescriptions filled? Whatever you say. Great. I'll call you tomorrow and let you know what time to pick me up. I'll go grab your coat. The pharmacy's just one block up that way. You won't have any trouble finding it. I'm sure I won't. I'll call you tomorrow? Richard, please hurry back. I really don't like the idea of staying in that house all by myself. I will. Maybe you can convince Mrs. Argyle to stay over tonight. She's done it before. No. I'll see you tomorrow? Okay. Bye, babe. - Afternoon. - Afternoon. - Are we running on time today? - We are. Good. I'm in a bit of a hurry. I'll bet you are. Seriously? Hey. You having car trouble? Yeah. The damn thing won't start. Well, what's wrong with it? Do you need a jump? Well, Richard said that it needed a new part and he ordered it, but I guess it never got fixed. Bummer. Maybe you oughta give him a call. He went to the mainland and he's not gonna be back until tomorrow. Double bummer. Yeah. Well, hey, I just got done with lunch shift and I am not doing anything special. Why don't I give you a ride home? Oh, I... I couldn't ask you to do that. Why not? I've always wanted to see the inside of the lighthouse. What better time? I... I don't know. Come on. I'm parked in the back lot. Okay, but pay no mind to the housekeeper. She's a real piece of work. I heard she rides around on a broom. This place is even cooler than I imagined. That's what I thought when I first got here, too. Not so much anymore? There's something that's just not quite right about this place. I can't explain it without sounding crazy. That's what Grace said. You knew Grace? No, I just heard a few things. What did you hear? Well... Just that she complained about hearing things in the night. Who knows? I wish Richard was here. He was away the night Grace died, too. So I heard. Thanks for the ride home and the company. I wish I could stay longer, but I have a date tonight. Lucky you. You're gonna be all right? Yeah, I'll be fine. Don't worry about me. What are you gonna do about your car? You know, I think I'm just gonna wait until Richard gets back. Maybe it'll start for him. All right. Well, if you need anything, call me. You've got my number. Thank you. Goodnight. Supper's on the table. You're leaving already? It's not even 7:00. I have some shopping to do for tomorrow. I'll clean up in the morning. Of course. Thank you. Why don't you leave? Why would I leave? This is my home. Just for tonight. Stay at the hotel. I'll be fine, Mrs. Argyle. I'll lock the door behind me. Oh, my God. Honey, I'm home. What are... What are you doing here? Why do you have that cane? You always ask so many questions. Well, you know, I'd completely forgotten. I have some very important unfinished business to take care of here, with you. Don't you come near me. You know, Anna, this house, it never really suited you. Too many strange things going on. Things that filled your head with all kinds of weird ideas. It's no wonder your doctor thought that you might try to hurt yourself. Now, I didn't believe him, of course. But now, I can see that I was wrong. Stay back. Beth said she saw you on the tower platform the other night. It looked like you might be going to jump. If only she had helped you out just a little, you wouldn't have to be going through any of this. What do you want from me? My money? You can have it. You can have it all! I know, and I need it desperately. And I've got plans for it, too. They just don't include you. Get off me! No! Richard, let go! Anna! Anna! Damn it! Help! Help, please. Say goodnight. Let's go inside, sweetie. So, let's see how the tower agrees with you. And if you need anything, just scream. Richard, let me out! Please! Let me out! Goodnight, Anna. I'll be back before morning. Let me out of here! Let me out, please... Oh, damn. Hey, it's Anna. Leave a message. Double damn. I wonder if she needs these. I'll bet by morning, she'll have completely lost her mind. You know, it's almost a shame, really. Don't feel bad for her. She belongs in a hospital. You're doing her a favor. You know, you're right. Mrs. Palmer? Mrs. Palmer? Mrs. Palmer, are you in there? What the hell was that? It's Anna. She must've gotten out. She's lost her mind. Yeah, she has lost her mind. Why don't you go do something about it? Oh, all right. You wait here. Argyle? What is she doing here? She's alive. Anna? Anna? Anna? Sweetie? Anna? Anna? Sweetie? I know you need help. Come on out and I'll help you. Honey? Where are you, sweetheart? Die! Oh, my God! Anna! Stop! Oh, my God. Argyle. Argyle... Oh, my God, you're okay. It's gonna be okay. I waited a long time for Richard to slip up. I knew he killed Grace. She'd told me of her suspicions. I wanted to prove he murdered her. But all I could do was wait and watch. But how did you know? When he left on the ferry today, just like he did the night Grace died, I thought he might come back tonight and try and kill Anna. Thank God you came back when you did. The night Grace died, I suspected that he returned, renting a boat to build an alibi. It was just a feeling, but... And that woman in the yard? Beth? Oh, she was part of this. I think she was blackmailing him over Miss Grace's death. So, now what? Now, I have a lot of explaining to do. But one thing is for certain. He got what he deserved. Poor Anna. She'll get the help she needs. I hope you're right. Dr. Shaw? She's asking for you again. I can't see her today. Can't? Why not? She's in a terrible state right now, but she will get better. Sometimes, I feel my presence isn't helping things. She needs a new doctor, someone she doesn't know. The only thing that seems to calm her down is... Is this ceramic horse. Can she have it? Well, she shouldn't, but... If she's struggling today, I don't see the harm. Thank you. Anna. I brought your horse. Thank you. You seem... afraid. Why are you afraid? There's no reason to be afraid. Especially, not with me. Why, I wouldn't hurt a fly.
