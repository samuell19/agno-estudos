[music, birds chirping] [filmmaker Rupert Murray] How much of our past lives - the thousands of moments we experience - help to make us who we are? If you took all of these remembrances - - these memories - away what would be left? How much is our personality - our identity - determined by the experiences we have? And how much is already there... ... pure "us"? [industrial noises] When I found out that an old friend of mine, Douglas Bruce, had mysteriously suffered total amnesia... losing all knowledge of the past 35 years of his life... I decided to make this film. I wanted to know what had happened, and why. How had those close to him been affected? What did memory loss feel like? And how had he coped? His astonishing story begins in New York City, on July the 2nd, 2003. The only thing that I know was that... I was on the phone to a friend of mine at eight o'clock at night, and he said to me that I had no real plans to go out, and to stay at home. He came and knocked on my door at seven o'clock in the morning... ... to see if I wanted to have breakfast, and... ... he rang and rang and said there was no one there. So sometime between eight o'clock at night... and seven o'clock in the morning, I must have left the house. As to that particular night, no one knows anything. [Rupert Murray] Doug had entered the initial stages of a particular type of amnesia, a very rare and bewildering medical phenomena called the fugue state. Unaware of himself, he must have left his apartment and entered the New York subway system. [Prof. Daniel Schacter] The fugue state is a very interesting condition in which an individual does not have the ability to retrieve information about their past. They may not even know who they are... but what makes it so interesting is that they're... they're not aware of that at the time. They may be traveling... ... or functioning in some way for hours, days, even weeks not knowing who they are but until they're put into a situation where somehow this is brought to their attention they're unaware of it. At the moment they become aware, then the fugue state per se is broken and they realize that they don't know who they are. [loud subway noises] [Rupert Murray] Doug opened his eyes on a subway train, miles from his home. [Doug] The first thing I see is... this scenery which I don't remember ever having seen at all, ever. And what I'm seeing is basically projects and sort of run-down... old concrete buildings, and... ... there was hardly anybody on the subway - and that also made me feel very uneasy - and then I didn't know where I was going, so... and suddenly I thought, where have I just come from? And this is... it's... ... you really struggle with that and... and then I suddenly realized, you know, I didn't know who I was. I was scared. I mean it's not anxiety, it's... you're scared, you're... in a place where you don't have any bearings, or... ... um... You don't know anything. It's... It's frightening. It's quite simply frightening. I had bumps on my head, my head hurt, it was throbbing. So I thought okay, well, I'll get off at the next stop. And, basically, I was in shorts and flip-flops and just a t-shirt. That's all I had. And a backpack. And it was cold and raining. I remember seeing that. People were speaking Russian. You're just trying to think of what you might have been doing or, you know... Where did I have dinner last night? Or what was I doing? Or what... ... and nothing comes. You're just trying to grasp at something. It's a bit like being in darkness. And I'm just clutching, you know, feeling your way around, trying to find something to hold on to. And you can't. [Prof. Schacter] The character of the amnesia depends on exactly what happened to cause that amnesia. For example, after a head injury, it would be very common for someone to be unable to remember the few minutes prior to the injury. And then, depending on the extent of brain damage, the retrograde amnesia may reach back a few minutes prior to the event, to - in extreme cases - years or decades prior to the event. However, in the very rare cases, you may have a retrograde amnesia that wipes out not only all individual experiences, but all knowledge of one's past. [Rupert] Suddenly Doug became aware of something over his shoulder... ... the backpack. He searched its contents... two sets of keys, a strange vial of liquid, mild painkillers, a Latin-American Spanish phrasebook, and a map of New York. But nothing that linked him to who he was. With nowhere else to go, he turned himself in to the police. [Lt. Peña] We normally get the runaway - a lot of runaway kids. They come back a couple of days later and we find them roaming the streets. Or you get the elderly that walk out, they forget to tell someone. That's regular... normal. Someone coming in, losing their memory, not knowing who they are, what their name is, anything at all... that's... I've never had that and it's very rare. They say to me, what do you... ... uh... yes, can we help you? and I said, yeah, ... I don't know who I am. [Lt. Peña] He didn't have any kind of identification on him - nothing. So we thought that he got robbed. But he didn't get... he wasn't struck. He doesn't remember being robbed. He remembers being around. He doesn't remember being hit at all. They sort of asked me, you know, do you take drugs? and I think, no. I mean, I don't know, but I don't think so. You speak with an English accent - you must be English. And so they'd flick through the book and then there's one guy who sees the number and he goes, yeah, I think I have something. [Rupert] At last someone who might be able to identify him. And then the officer that had the phone comes out and I say to him, well, you know... what... what happened? He said, "Well, she doesn't recognize you." [Rupert] Doug's hopes were dashed. Who was the woman on the other end of the phone? Why did Doug have her number? And why didn't she recognize him? We just didn't know what do, what to think about what happened to him. Um, maybe it was just a freak... a freak case... and... I guess it was. [laughs] [Prof. Schacter] Some degree of memory loss is very common - whether we want to call it amnesia or not - as a result of aging, Alzheimer's disease, head injury, and so on. Extreme forms of memory loss to which we would give the term "amnesia" where one is so impaired by the inability, let's say, toform new memories in the case of anterograde amnesia that you can't carry on with your life, are relatively rare but occur regularly as a result of various forms of neurological insult. Retrograde amnesia, where someone has a complete wipeout of their memory for their entire past, are extremely rare. Those are the rarest of all kinds of amnesias. [Doug] So we go off in the ambulance to the hospital and... I walk in the hospital and that's terrifying because you've got people who're cut open everywhere, people in comas, and on the drips, drug addicts who are just screaming... people that are mainly drunks... everything... I mean it's the worst process in the emergency room, Coney Island Hospital. [Rupert] Without a name, the nurses wrote "Unknown White Male" on his chart. [Doug] They kept asking me my name and that's really the last thing that I wanted to be asked 'cause, you know, I didn't know. [Doctor Vorobyev] Frankly speaking - first time in my life. I've never seen such kind of amazing clinical case like Douglas. That was known for me only from movies, actually. [Rupert] Only from the movies? Only from movies. And from my textbooks, of course. What got me interested in him - he was a very good-looking man with a cute little English accent and very polite - very, very polite. A lot of people were coming in just to look at him because it was so unusual to have a young handsome man in the middle of the summer and not to know who they are or where they're from. And he didn't look like he was an alcoholic, drug addict. Very neat, very well-dressed... just totally out of it. [Prof. Schacter] There are three major types of long-term memory: Episodic memory - that's memory for unique experiences that happened in a particular time, in a particular place. Semantic memory - that's our general knowledge of the world, the kind of memory that we acquire through learning and school... facts, language, that sort of thing, concepts. And the third one we call procedural memory - and that's memory for skills, memory for knowing how to do things, as opposed to knowing that something is so. So learning to ride a bicycle, learning to play a sport, learning to type, these are all examples of procedural memory. [Rupert] The hospital ran every test. They found that his blood was completely clean of drugs or alcohol... ... and that the vial in the backpack was medicine for a dog. [Dr. Vorobyev] Firstly when we have such kind of cases, we would like to rule out organic causes, ...meaning tumors or bleeding into the brain. But as far as I know the CAT scan was normal and further evaluation, including outpatient neurological evaluations, didn't reveal anything that would have explained this amnesia. Some small pituitary tumor was found but it doesn't explain amnesia. [Rupert] Amazingly they found a small tumor growing on Doug's pituitary gland that had probably been there since birth. It was not deemed a health risk and was ruled out as a possible cause of the amnesia. The small bumps on his head could have triggered it but it was unlikely. With no conclusive clinical evidence, he was transferred to the psychiatric unit. [Doug] So they moved me to the psychiatric ward, and... ... and everything gets put into a locker and everything, and, um... and then they said, "Can you sign this?" And I sort of pick up the pen and... you know, there's this sort of thing that just goes like this and I just went brrrr, like that, and I said "Look I can fucking... "I'm somebody! I have a signature!" you know? and ... um... I couldn't believe that they hadn't asked this earlier of me. And... so I'm really pissed off with them, you know? It's... it's something which is really hard and I'm trying to... 'cause my signature's a scrawl basically. It's just totally illegible. And then I realize that... that my first letter starts with a "D" you know, and... They have been calling me "Johnny" all day. They asked me, what would you want to be called? And they said, do you want to be called "John"? So I said, yeah, okay, that's fine. And so... And I suddenly realized and said, look, you know, I am somebody. [Prof. Schacter] I think what this kind of observation tells us - - that he could sign his name - - is that it's not a complete wipeout of memory across the board. Again we have to come back to the idea that there are different kinds of memory. So clearly what's most affected here is episodic memory that does seem to be wiped out across the board. Procedural memory, or memory for skills and how to do things typically, in these cases, is preserved. [Doug] They said, well, until somebody identifies you, you're not going to be released. So they made it quite clear that there absolutely no way that... ... I was going to be let out unless somebody identified me. So it became more and more important for me to... you know... to have somebody find me. [Rupert] He kept on trying the telephone number. He was convinced that Eva was his only way out. She must have some idea of who he was. And I'm looking at this pink piece of paper, you know, with Eva Eckert's name on it and... um... and I'm trying to remember, you know... where... why I had written this down. [Eva] I got a phone call from a hospital - Did I know a young man? I said, well, I know many young men. So they put him on the phone, and he said, "Hello I'm so scared - I'm scared, I'm scared." That's the only thing he said. I said, "You don't know who you are you? You don't know your name?" "No," he said, "I don't." I said," Well, do you know who I am?" He said, "No." I said, "I'm Eva Eckert." He said, "I don't know... Can you please come and pick me up?" And I would have liked to go and take the subway to Coney Island, right there and then, but I couldn't because I was taking care of my 90-year old mom who has dementia and who can't be left alone. The voice of this man... I knew I had heard the voice before. I didn't know who it was and who it belonged to. But I knew I had heard the voice, so... I called my daughter who had gone to Long Island and I said, "Can you imagine what happened?" And I told her the story and she said, "Mommy, Mommy. "One of these crazy stories! Forget about it!" My mom always gets really involved in people's lives who she doesn't know and sometimes to a fault. And people steal things from her and... whatever... She gets way too involved sometimes. [Eva] I said please, drive by this hospital and check if it's somebody you might even know him because the voice to me... I... I don't know if it's not one of your friends. What am I supposed to do? Like, there's nothing I can do from here, the phone number's busy. And she's, like, well, you got to go there, and I was, like... Mom... [laughs] I'm three hours away, it's like the most traffic in the world to go to this hospital to see someone who... who knows? The only thing that you're sort of hoping - that you're clinging on to - is that this person is coming and is identifying you. And this pink piece of paper sort of pans out, Otherwise, you know, uh... there's nothing to connect me to anything ever in the world... and I'm sort of stuck there. [Nadine] My mom gave me the number and I called the number... and they put Doug on the phone and I immediately knew who it was. It was like everything bone in my body. He was so scared. And she goes, oh my god, and... ... she says... you know... she goes... I said... ...she said, "Doug?" and I said,"I don't know." And she goes, "Yeah, you're Doug. "I'm coming to get you in half an hour." And... You know, for me that was just, um... It was, you know, it's like... I don't know... I can't really describe the feeling of... ...you know, the relief, the sense of, you know, belonging... I don't know... um... um... And she... and she said, yeah, I know who you are - You have, you know, you have a great life and everything. Don't worry. I promise you, I'm going to be there in half an hour, you know. My name's Nadine, um... and... and so... whatever... This was at about 11:30 or something and she came with a friend of hers, Kara, and sort of identified me and, um... I mean the relief of the whole thing... of leaving that place and being in the car and then seeing those buildings that I had been past which were now sort of lit up and saying that I was leaving all that... and... um... [music - Dvorak Symphony No. 8] [music continues] [Rupert] On the morning of July the 4th, Douglas Bruce, 35, woke up to discover that before his amnesia life had treated him very well. He found out he'd been a successful stockbroker who'd stopped work at 30 to take up photography. He now lived alone in a large loft apartment in the East Village with his three cockatoos and two dogs. With a video camera, he started an astonishing record of his new life... filming his first impressions of the world around him. [Doug] So, might as well go and have a look at the house - it's where I live. It's nice. These are paintings done by Magda. I said, I thought that they were mine I'm starting to get used to the fact that I live here. Before it was as if a stranger... I was living in a stranger's place, a friend or something like that. Here's the bedroom... ... dream catcher... ... I had intense dreams... ... my stuff... ... my clothes. It's funny, my clothes, because it feels as if I'm wearing somebody else's... um... unless I've worn them twice or something which I'm used to it, but... [Rupert] It's hard to imagine what those first days were like. Not only Doug's past history, but his practical knowledge of how his life actually worked, had been erased. He was a stranger in his own home and lost in the streets around it. He had to discover how much money he had in the bank, and find out who his family and friends were. Get the f... - Switch it off! - Why? Switch it off! I am not going to... Douglas, I am not going to do this. Give it to me. You do look great. This is Magda. [Rupert] Magda and Doug had lived together for over eight years and have remained close friends after their relationship ended. She flew back from Poland as soon as she heard the news. [Magda] When I arrived here, I decided to... I mean, I decided to... I mean, it's hard to say in that way... but I kind of took control of the whole medical situation. 'Cause I probably didn't want to go to bed thinking that maybe he's got a clot in his head and he might not wake up tomorrow, be in a coma. So I really stressed on the fact that we need to go and have him thoroughly, you know, checked out. How do you feel? How do I feel... today? Yeah. I'm sort of confused. Confused by what? Well I don't... I don't remember anything past last Thursday, so... But can you explain exactly confusion - the confusion that you have right now in your head - what's confusing you in particular? Well, what's confusing me is the fact that I can name cities in Australia... No, I'm saying in everyday life, like right now. - Like right now? - Yes. Well, uh... I'm confused as to why nobody can find what's wrong with me. [Prof. Schacter] One of the things that we're starting to learn about these cases as more of them have been reported is that there's just an incredible amount of variability. You can't say that there's any one picture. Some of them recover in a few days, some that have been tracked have not recovered their memory for years. [Rupert] Doug's neurologist, his endocrinologist, and his psychiatrist all had their different theories but still no one could give him a definitive answer. And he was growing tired of the endless examinations. I've had two head MRI's, - I've had one MRI on... - [Magda] Douglas... Douglas... on my pituitary gland I've had two CAT scans, one CAT scan on my head, one on my pituitary gland... - And you're fine. - I've had 26 blood tests... - You're fine. - ...and they're not showing anything so we have information that says that I've... that... - Your brain is fine, you're not going to die. - ...that my brain is functioning but nobody knows why my... yeah, fine... fantastic. So I'm a bit confused about that. What's the problem? - Well, there's nothing... - Isn't that something to be confused about? Well, psychogenic amnesia occurs in cases where people lose some aspect of their memory and there's no known cause in the brain, or no cause in the brain can be indentified. So it's then assumed to be attributable to some sort of psychological cause - as opposed to a direct damage to the brain. The brain... brain function must be changed in some way, in psychogenic amnesia, for it to occur, but it's not thought to be the result of actual direct, physical damage to the brain. For many researchers they're less interested in studying those cases because there's not the opportunity to learn about normal memory function or how the brain relates to memory. There's also the worry for many researchers that in cases of psychogenic amnesia that the amnesia may be, in some sense, malingered. By malingering we mean someone is possibly capable of remembering, but prefers not to remember. In an extreme form, is out-and-out faking the amnesia. [Nadine] I know, but I have to... in the two hours... ... I have to leave, I have to go home... I have to bring... I have to get my junk... ... get my... [Rupert] Nadine and Doug had been on a few dates together and then they broke up. Two days later, her mother Eva got the call from Coney Island Hospital. So we have less than an hour. People thought that it was a total scam... that he... it was like some weird guy that I've met and gone on a couple dates with and then broken up with, or whatever, and then... ... had invented some malady and... ... whatever! I remember that I had had coffee with him once with Nadine, that she had introduced him to me but I must say that I was a little bit suspicious. I was always saying to that do you think he really doesn't remember? And with other friends, you know, that met Doug and we were all kind of wondering if it could really happen. It's something that you don't want to really accept, that it could happen to all of us potentially. [Doug] Hi, Eva! [Doug laughs] What? Where is the strainer? Where is the strainer? [dog barks] There's no strainer? [Doug] No, there's a strainer. What kind of stainer do you need? He was giving me this hug that was... I think it when he gave me the hug, I was kind of thinking no, he's not making this up. [Doug] I'm having so much fun. [Eva] I feel very strong for him now. I really love him. He's my son. [laughs] Like he's almost, you know, my son... yeah. [Nadine] The morning afterwards, when we brought him home, he woke up and... It was really weird 'cause I didn't know that much about his family, and he didn't really even ask about his family and he just didn't want to talk to anyone on the phone. He woke up really early, and he was like, "Where's my mother?" And it was... it was so... I had to tell him that his mother had passed away. And I started crying and he started crying and we were both kind of there, and... that was a really, really tough... that was probably the toughest thing... ... that I had to tell him was... ... you know... Because we've been trying to contact his sisters and trying to contact people and we couldn't, and then... it was like this weird afterthought, like... "Do I have a mother? Where's my mother?" [music - Karsh Kale Home"] [Rupert] Doug had been at his mother's bedside when she was dying of cancer in Paris some years earlier. His father and younger sister now lived in Spain. Doug took a terrifying first flight to come face-to-face with his closest family, not knowing anything about them. He filmed his first trip, and then I visited the family later to find out what it was like to meet him for the very first time. [music] [crowd noises] There were just hoards of people there. I mean, it was so scary... Marina said later that I had... she was afraid to come up to me because my eyes were just popping out of my head, and that I was just looking... you know, around like this, and... and there were people with signs everywhere, and I thought that maybe... maybe I'd have my... my father would have a sign for me or something, and... people were - because I had the video camera - were saying, hey, uh, you know, this way and then I thought, well, maybe that's my father and... it just didn't make sense, and just so many people, and I was tired, and I had the dog and... [crowd noises] When he came out from the airport, he was filming so he was filming our sort of initial reaction of how do we say hi to him. Do we hug him? Or was he going to feel that's too much of an invasion of his personal space? Or... It's all these things that you're trying to deal with, he was sort of filming the whole thing, and... Yeah, it was just it was very difficult. I see times haven't changed - still video camera in hand. How was the trip? Douglas is definitely one of the most important people in my life and so very nervous that he... just when he saw me that he wouldn't feel that sort of closeness or just... "Yeah, she's my sister, cool" but, you know, nothing more. She's really sweet, you know? She's... I'm really happy to have her as a sister. She sort of looks nothing like me. She's... dark and with black hair and creased eyes and a big smile. She's either smiling or frowning... there's no sort of in-between expressions, it seems. And... I don't know... And then I met my father and my father's not at all what I expected. Hi, Douglas. Well, there I was playing the loving father, you know. Douglas, you know, I am your father. I love you. I am always there, you know. Whatever you need let me know, whatever. And he looked at me with his usual big grin and he said, "Well, it's nice to meet you." [laughs] I felt that this was, um... a moment of grace, if you like. ... and... dark hair and glasses and he was wearing this yellow t-shirt... ... which he hasn't taken off since! I mean, today's Tuesday and he's been wearing that same t-shirt ever since, every day! So every picture that I've ever taken of him, he's wearing that yellow t-shirt and people are just gonna think I took it all in one morning or one day or something. But it's over several days and maybe he's gonna wear it till the end of the vacations. I don't know. It was one of the few times in my life - I don't wanna say it bragging - but when I was frightened. Um... I just didn't know what I should be doing. And, um... I just did my best. There aren't many cases like this. I mean if there was some track record of others, or something, but you know, this is apparently a very rare occurrence. So anyway he was here and, um... he rested. That's what's what it came to. But then I began to observe also that, in subtle ways, possibly, he had changed. He had always been a very outgoing sort of character... and fairly sure of himself, and... I always wanted it that way, as a father, anyway... that's what you want your son to be. But now he had become sort of reflective, if that's the right word. We began to discuss philosophy. Um... to be precise, existentialist philosophy. And he showed interest in it. Now this is something which Douglas [laughs] never ever showed an interest in. [Doug] Do you think, having seen me for three days that, um... that my core is the person that I was before? Or you believe that I am a blank piece of paper that... from which I can, you know, become the person who I will be from my actions? But does it, does it worry you? No, not at all. I'm just asking you for your opinion. [Father] You are a stranger as you are to me, because you... ...you have no relationship to all the things which we knew together, good and bad, you know? Me and your mother formed your character in some ways. - Right? - [Doug] Right. So now, I don't think I could do that. Well, I mean it would be wrong. You know, you're a mature man. And, um... but one who has a chance, you know - looking at all this and saying, well, what does my... as you say, what does my instinct say? And if you're not sure, you could always ask me. I can always give you an opinion. There's nothing wrong with, um... with asking questions, if you're unsure. And who better, if you think about it, to give these answers than your family? Right, but, I mean, I'm not disputing what you're saying, but... my family might be intending to do well for me but it might not be the right judgment. What makes their judgment right over somebody else's? [music - Mascagni Cavalleria Rusticana] [Marina] In some ways he's exactly the same, and in other ways, he's a completely changed person. He's a lot more open. He's a lot more emotional, in the sense that he shows emotions. But I think maybe he's lost a little bit of his spark that he used to have. But then maybe it wasn't a spark, it was maybe more of an edge whereas now he's a lot more relaxed, I think, maybe a lot more comfortable with who he is. It's strange because until recently I'd gotten used to the idea and it was fine and in the last couple of months, I've started to really really miss him. Miss the old Doug? Yeah. [music] [Rupert] The final member of Doug's immediate family is his other sister, Christina. I traveled ahead to see her on the day they met for the first time. [Christina] The one thing I did find very strange is that he hasn't asked anything about the past in our family, because, um... my sister is much younger than us and my mother died, so I'm probably the closest link really to his younger years and he hasn't asked me anything he hasn't seemed at all interested which I find really, really weird. Of course you can't possibly say what you would be like but I think I would be... a bit curious myself if that happened to me... about my childhood and, you know... So I want to speak to him about it. Hiya. Oh, hi! [muffled laughter] I'm sorry, I just didn't recognize you with sunglasses. Yeah, there's definitely a connection. I have definitely a connection with Christine. I felt that for sure. I could feel there's something, I mean. I felt it with Marina when I first saw her and it goes beyond, you know, experiences that you can remember with people. There's something chemical. [Christina] Well, I thought you were never happy working. You were never happy doing that because really... I don't know - you interested? - Did you want some...? - Yeah! And, um... I guess you were quite driven to making money for whatever reason. But you're never happy. You were so stressed out. You'd be like... you'd come back from after work You'd be pacing around the kitchen for about... It would take ages to calm down, whatever... Wow. Yeah. Um... and... ... and then I think as soon as you thought you could, you stopped work. It was great talking to Christina because she's very matter-of-fact about everything, and... She explained a lot of things so when I explained to her it was uh... ... well, it's thought that maybe what's happened is due to a psychological trauma she thought it was maybe something to do with my mother. [Christina] When our mother died you... I think it was really difficult, really hard for you. I think it really... but you never would talk about it... at all. And you were around when... you know, when... when she was really ill in Paris because she spent the last couple of months... she went back to Paris. And that was already hard. And then you were just really shut in, and... You know, we used to joke that you were my mother's favorite. But you were her little boy. She adored... I mean I know she loved me, and Marina was different - she was the baby of the family. But Douglas was like the Golden Boy. The first child died when it was a few days old. So it must have been... well, I can't imagine what it must have been like. So then she was... and then she had you. [music] It's possible that you know, that there were certain traumatic experiences that happened in my past life and... my... you know... my brain didn't... or me, or whatever didn't want to deal with it anymore, and it shut down in order to block it out. When I do remember, I'm... I'm apprehensive of the fact that I'm going to remember things that are... quite worrying, quite, um... quite traumatic really. And I know, you know, I know they're out there. [keys jangling] [Rupert] Doug could only hear about the experiences of his life, secondhand. His past now belonged to everyone else but him. The only place he could get close to the things he had done - on his terms - was in a storeroom in Paris where many of his past belongings had been kept. [mechanical toy whirring] "Douglas Bruce and guest - "Mr. and Mrs. Jack Baines "request the pleasure of your company "at the marriage of their daughter, Michelle Rachel "to Mr. Nicholas Charles Terrace." [to Rupert] Do you know who that is? -Yeah. [Doug] Every little square inch alludes to some new personal memory, whether it was clothing that I might have worn or... shells that I picked up somewhere or... those two lances up there, or these paintings. And it's not open to somebody's interpretation or of events, which is normally what I have to deal with. This is actually what is and what was. There's no, you know... everything is tangible here. That head is that head. It's not, you know... somebody saw it a particular way or whatever. And so, you know... ultimately this is a room of... complete truth. It's funny because I used to hoard things away, it seems, whereas now I don't have any importance for stuff like that. [music - The Protection Company Kimeaa] [Rupert] Why should Doug be obsessed with the past when what lay in front of him was a voyage of unbelievable discovery? Doug now saw the world with the eyes of a newborn baby... but appreciated it with the mind of an adult. [Doug] I would be aware of everything - everything would interest me, you know - - everything! Everything was totally new. [music - Stravinsky Petrushka] It was crazy, I mean it was completely, completely crazy. The first month in New York was just totally, totally crazy. Just watching the relationship between a guy and a girl, or the way people people would express themselves by the way they dress, or their mannerisms, or... um... everything! I mean, you know, everything was totally new, basically. Chocolate mousse, I think? Or did I just hear about that? [Doug] I remember actually eating my first chocolate mousse for the first time. And the strawberries. They said, "Here..." Because they - Kara and Nadine - took great thrills in, "Okay, well, look here - "these are blueberries, these are strawberries... "Let's go out, let's go to a restaurant..." Italian, Cuban, French... everything. ...trying to discover it all. [wind] You know, when I went to the ocean for the first time there was not a cloud in the sky. It was a beautiful orange light and the beach was completely empty and then you get to the ocean and the ocean was just crazy the colors - and I was overwhelmed I started to cry. It wasn't so much the beauty of it, it was over-... "ahh!"... [unintelligible] I had difficulty in breathing. I was just so overwhelmed. I put my feet in like that and just the sense of it, just the energy rushing onto my legs, I don't know how to describe it. It was just this extraordinary energy... ... that was just going around because the waves were just breaking and surf that was just breaking all around my knees and... it just felt absolutely amazing - - the texture of it - and then I dived in I didn't know if I could swim and you know, the moment I realized that I could instinctively... it was fantastic. [music] [Doug] The first time I went to the Met... ... I mean, it just blew me away. [music] You know, I'm thrilled because I do a history class at school and it's enabled me to find out the last 500 years of what's been going on in the world. And that's like, a great help. Yeah, I want to know everything. [music] [Rupert] With everything fresh in his eye, Doug saw no clichés or stereotypes. Only originality. [music] [Prof. Schacter] There are some aspects of memory that are shared among individuals - - our general knowledge. Psychologists call that semantic memory. Your semantic memory, my semantic memory might have a lot of overlap. But our episodic memories probably have very little overlap because my specific experiences have been very different from yours and from everyone else. So it's that episodic memory system that I think is tied to our uniqueness and our individuality. [Doug] It's snowing! [Rupert] Doug filmed the first time he saw snow... and fireworks. [explosions] [Doug] Snow! [street noises, sirens] [Nadine] I do remember the months afterwards when things kind of settled down and I was back in school and he was in school he'd call me and be like, "I discovered the best band!" and I'd be like, "Oh what are they called?" and he's like, "The Rolling Stones!" Oh! You know... I actually introduced Doug to smoking weed. I got him stoned for the first time! Can I tell that on camera? That was the funniest thing. We were... I was like, come on. I was convinced he was gonna get his memory back. [Doug] This picture here is a bit of a mystery... ... no idea what it is. Looks beautiful, though. It just doesn't seem to belong in the flat. I don't know, maybe it's not mine. And that's me, with two of my best friends. I think, uh... Pete Small and James Philips, I think. Jim Philips I spoke to Pete the other day... He's nice. Was it a wedding? [church bells] [Rupert] Doug had spent fifteen years of his life in England, but he had no recollection of his time here or the friends he had made... ...including me. The last time we saw Doug was at a friend's wedding, three months before his amnesia. Eleven months later and we still hadn't seen him... and we were starting to worry. We didn't know what was going on or what we should do. I went to see Pete, who used to be Doug's closest friend. [Pete] It's very difficult to know exactly what goes through his head 'cause, you know, he's just forgotten everything. Sometimes I'd be talking to him... initially, it was like... Last conversation we had was talking about Chelsea Football Club just after they'd been bought by the Russian guy. You know, and he was massive Chelsea. And then the next time I speak to him, after he's lost his memory... I rang him up... and Magda had written a little sort of paragraph on everybody he knew from all around the world in case somebody rang him up. And I rang him up, knowing that he's lost his memory, and I've just gone, "Hi, Doug, this is Pete Small, you don't know me." He's going, "Yeah," and he's obviously reading it off the piece of paper There's on Pete Small: "Chelsea Football Club" and he's finished the sentence by going, "...whoever the hell they are." You know, and that's the first conversation I've had with him and I'm like... it's sort of suddenly you realize, yeah, he really has lost his memory 'cause he wouldn't, you know... unless he's really the greatest bullshitter in the world. You could just tell by the voice... "Who is... what is this Chelsea Football Club?" [Rupert] You haven't seen him in person? I haven't seen him, no. I should really go out and see him. I was gonna go at the end of last year but it's... it's difficult. I mean that's the big step - that's the big one. [Rupert] I asked Doug if he wanted to make this film. I wanted to bring him back to London and record the emotional reunion with his old friends... Yeah ... but I wasn't sure how he'd react. Yeah, but... well I'll tell you why it's interesting... It's interesting 'cause, um... you know, 'cause you and I used to be friends. If I came for that weekend, would you mind if I filmed what we did? Okay... ... excellent. [music] [Rupert] I'd met Doug through a large group of mutual friends. We were all in our early 20's with everything to play for and nothing to lose... ... or so we thought. [music] The Doug I remember was fast-living. He was generous with his cash and had a penchant for monkey bikes - two tone - and expensive champagne. He was a compelling character... slightly eccentric with a vaguely arrogant air and a sharp tongue. Here... come here. - What? I would like to introduce you to somebody. [speaking French] [Rupert] These home movie clips - - a few snatched glimpses out of an entire lifetime - hardly tell you anything about who he really was. How can you reconstruct a man from moments distorted by the camera and who was behind it? [Pete] What do you want, Doug? I want $600 US. What are you gonna do if doesn't give it to you? Tell us, tell the camera what you're gonna do to him. Six hundred things. I'll then go and cash his ticket - - so that will probably be okay - - and then he can sort himself out. Excellent news. That's the way I look at it. Means I can sell his ticket on from Miami 'cause we can both be in the cash. No something more all along the lines of cashing his ticket and maybe upgrading myself to first class on the way home. What's that, fat boy? Ugh... Fifty-four hundred meters, Base Camp Everest... [panting] Phew! Every breath is like... - There's not enough oxygen... - No... - It's like somebody's just... - Someone's holding your chest tight. Yeah... It's like having had... a tequila and Southern Comfort bender. Don't make me laugh... it hurts! [laughter] [wind] [Rupert] To tell you the truth, I was quite scared. How much had he changed over the last eight months? [buzzer] Who was the person I was about to meet? [intercom] Hello? Doug? It's Rupert. [door buzzes] [elevator dings] - Hello - Doug - Nice to see you. - Nice to see you, too. How are you doing? - I'm doing good. - You're all right? - Yeah - I've just got to get a couple of bags out... - Is that all you came with? - Huh? - That's it? - Yeah, that's quite a lot isn't it? Well, um... Yeah, I don't need much. I've just got my little camera... - So, yeah... so what does that do? - Huh? [Rupert] Those first moments were uncomfortable. I started to ramble... Talking about my cameras was easier than asking him, "Do you know who I am?" Of course he didn't - he'd lost his memory. I was a complete stranger. The more we talked, the less I recognized the person in front of me. Our 15 years of history didn't mean anything We had to start all over again. I felt there was some kind of rapport - he looked and sounded just like the man I used to know, but it was obvious something had changed. Would I like the new Doug? Would he like me? [Doug] I'm meeting you for the first time. I have no kind of background or anything to go by other than our phone conversations. So it's really an instinctive thing. Either you're feeling it or you're not. And there's good friends that I've had in the past who I've met them and I just don't don't get them. I don't feel it and so I don't hang out with them. Which for them it's... it's tough and... - Yeah. It must be tough for them. Um, I suppose... I don't know. Well that's, you know... that's obviously one of the more disturbing things, or worrying things for me about the situation is that, um... After the accident, I felt much more comfortable with people who didn't know me. And it's basically the idea of expectancy... ... that somebody's expecting me to be the person that they knew - which in a way, I probably am anyway - but for me it's... it's a completely new start. I was very confused because I no longer knew the person across the table. It was difficult to feel any emotion. It was almost as if the person I'd cared about wasn't in the room. And I was amazed by what he had to say next. The longer that it goes on, the less I care if my memory comes back. And if anything I feel slightly apprehensive about when it does come back because how is it going to come back? And what am I going to think? And so I'm thinking that... ... that my mind isn't actually wanting it to come... I mean, not wanting it to come back but there's no pressure on it to come back, and so... ... maybe it will, maybe it won't. I don't care too much anymore. [Magda] For people that know him very well, this situation right now is very strange because, for me, um... it's sort of... by getting used to who he is now, he's sort of, like, undermining his previous self. We see each other and we, you know... we spend time together... and we hang out, and... um... and I'm sort of getting used to the new Doug which sort of erases the old Doug for me. And it's very weird because that sort of has an effect on my own history, too which seems to be undermined at this point because I don't think, like... then who was... Where is the person that I've had a history with? [Rupert] That person now only existed in our memories or on film. I'd brought over some old home movies almost to prove to Doug that we were old friends. I was curious to see what effect it would have on him. [music from computer] - Who's that? - Well who do you think it is? Mr. Small. [laughs] That's Pete? - Oh, wow. - That's you. - That's Rupert. - Oh, wow. Where we're going looks like that says "lady salesmen"? - That's you. - Wow. [Magda bursts out laughing] That's you! Ha, ha, ha! That's you! [still laughing] It's excellent. It's so good! Wow. [Magda laughs] -But, I mean, I really... - Can I see it again? [music - Dandy Livingstone Rudy, A Message to You] ♪ Stop your running about ♪ ♪ It's time you straighten right out ♪ ♪ Stop your running around ♪ ♪ Making trouble in town ♪ ♪ Aha-a, Rudy ♪ ♪ A messsage to you, Rudy ♪ ♪ A messsage to you ♪ [Doug] It makes me feel sad watching this. I think it's a bit like looking at an old film or something and seeing something you like about that film and wanting to... you know... wishing for instance that you lived at that time. Do you see what I'm saying? And here it's odd because I'm actually in the pictures and... but I don't really feel any direct connection to it at all. I don't feel any connection to this character because... I mean, I don't feel that I look like that and I can't identify dressing like that or... And I don't know anybody else in it. You know I haven't met any of them. So this is, you know, it's just really like viewing a movie. I find it sad, you know, just watching this. You know... it's these little moments here, for instance, when Pete walks around here into this supermarket and he gives that little sort of nod of the head like that and some kind of expression. It's sort of these little mannerisms you probably know really well from him or you would expect that from him and, you know, I don't. I don't know anything. [birds chirping] [Rupert] Dislocated from his past... had Doug now become a completely new person? Or was he the same person, greatly altered by the defining experience of his life? A question I couldn't really answer but one that philosophers have been wrestling with for centuries. [Mary Warnock] I think there's no doubt that Douglas is the same man in the sense that you could - someone could - trace his existence from birth to where he is now. But he wouldn't feel responsible for what he did before his memory loss. And so, in that sense, I think that he could be said not to be the same person. But it is true, I think, that our distinctions... ... our talking about who is a person and who is not, whether people dispute whether an embryo is a person and so on... this is actually a matter of the way we use language in normal cases. and when we get something which is very rare, very abnormal, then we don't quite know what to do with our language - how to fit what's happened into the categories that we're accustomed to using. So I think we have to acknowledge that we don't quite know what to say. But I would on the whole go along with John Locke and say... certainly the same man... questionably the same person. [music - My Robot Friend Way Down] [Rupert] Given a new lease of life Doug seemed to be more articulate than before - more serious, more sensitive, more focused... as if his senses had been sharpened by a rebooting of the system. [music] [Doug] Coming back in September, I needed to have a purpose in life and photography gave me that - going to school and everything. So I really tried to devote as much time as possible... and I've obviously got a lot to catch up on compared to everybody else. At school, I think it's a really important thing for me because you know it gets me up to speed for a lot of things. I mean, people say to me that I'm much more into photography now than I was before. for sure... and for me it was definitely a thread. It gave me a purpose of life. [Rupert] Prior to his memory loss, Doug had been studying photography for two years. In order to rejoin the course, he had to relearn all of those skills in just two months. [Stephen Frailey] We first needed to make sure that he was ready to go into his third year. So he quickly amassed all those skills with the help of some of our faculty. And that, in and of itself, was really interesting, the fact that he was such a quick learn. It was almost as if some of these procedures and processes were familiar to him in some completely recessed way. A creative sensibility for the most part - as far as conventional wisdom goes - is formed by our memory - is formed by our past. It's the accumulation of our experience. If you wipe that slate clean, how do you develop a sensibility? How do you figure out what it is that's relevant for you? If you're going to pursue your art with any sort of depth - - with any kind of resonance - how do you figure out what your subject is? I think that his work has gained enormous depth. He's basically always been interested in portraiture. I think the portraiture that he was making was problematic... -ideologically problematic - and I think that soon after his accident he made some amazing images very simple, very austere portraits of some people that he was close to, or becoming close to, or perhaps had a relationship with before his accident. And there was a sadness in the portraits and there was a sense of depth and also a sense of emptying out in the portraits that I thought was a surrogate for what he was experiencing. In a sense, I thought that they were self-portraits. Come on, Gaija. I'm obviously nervous about going to London. I'm going to meet friends who've known me for 20 years and some who I'm quite close with, it seems. and... you know, I could be sitting in a restaurant next to them and wouldn't know who they were... I always sort of fear the expectations and almost feel that I have an obligation to them as well... ...morally. [Pete] Known each other for 20 odd years... going back to, probably... 1986. He's definitely been scared to see other people and I mean... and where... where it's similar. I mean if I wasn't scared about meeting Doug then I would've met him already. Although he's coming over and he's meeting us, it's taken so long... and from what I've heard, what people said, that he doesn't actually worry too much about the fact that he's lost his memory. So it's not like he's desperate to reacquaint himself with his past and his past relationships. So it's almost going to be harder, I suppose, the meeting somebody fresh because there's that knowledge that there was some sort of relationship beforehand. But for him it must be like, "Why did I hang out with these guys?" "What's so interesting about them?" He's got to make the decisions out of that... ...as he gets to know his past... which bits of re-embrace, and which bits to discard. And in some ways he's quite lucky that he's in a position where he can make that decision 'cause if he suddenly meets someone he doesn't like them any more, you go, "Sorry, I'm not the same person I was. Piss off." It'd be great. [Rupert] Before the reunion in a local pub, I took Doug on an impromptu sightseeing trip. I don't know whether it's stranger for him... or for me. It's much more beautiful that New York... that's for sure. Well, it's a bit like the Upper East Side, a bit. [cabbie] This is Buckingham Palace coming up on the left, yeah? [Rupert] Is it? Brilliant. [cabbie] These people are here because it's Changing of the Guard. [Doug] I can't believe how many people come to see. What's going on? - [Rupert] It's Changing the Guard, man. - [Doug] Which means what? The different guys...? - These soldiers come down here, and then they change with the ones over there... - and then the other ones come back... - And these are the guys that guard the Palace? But there aren't any soldiers! Oh, hello... [shouting commands] Hang on - so wait... let me get this straight - I mean, just check out how many people there are here! Look at that... It's like a gas key picture. [Rupert] That's, um... Westminster Abbey. And um... [cabbie] We'll go past 10 Downing Street now. What's Downing Street? [Rupert] That's where the Prime Minister, - whoever it may be - runs the country from. - So he lives there. - Yeah, he lives there. The Chancellor of the Exchequer lives next door. [Doug] Ah... it's a beautiful city, I mean what I've seen of it. And you know what it reminds me of? It reminds me of those opening scenes in... in that film "28 Days Later." That's the only kind of association I can make with it. But it's... what's amazing is, you know, well... [Jim] It is... I don't know... I suppose I've been looking forward to it. It's gonna be odd. It's gonna be odd, but I suppose... I haven't really thought about what's gonna happen really. [crowded pub noises] [Pete] All right, mate - how you doin'? - Good to see you, buddy. - [Jim] All right, Dougie. Take a seat. What are you drinking? Um... I don't know.. - Take a seat. Welcome back to England. - ...whatever you guys are drinking. [Doug] So it's sort of overwhelming You good? - Yeah, it's just... - Knackered. Yeah... a bit jet lagged. I think I'm really in need of food more than anything else. You look just like in your picture anyway. I wasn't sure if I was going to recognize Jim because... - He talks like a fat one. [laughs] - In the picture you had your... [Pete] Your whole relationships with people are built up on frameworks and conversational references that you've built up over those years. And once you take those references away I find it very difficult to communicate with someone. Doug and I shared a love of cricket and one in particular was he was obsessed with West Indian cricket. and we used to go to test matches in the Caribbean. And I sent him an email and I said, I look forward to reintroducing you to the ways of West Indian cricket. The email I got back said... "What is West Indian cricket? Is it a drink or some kind of insect?" And I was like, where do you start? I don't know. - Ah - Chazzle - He's 21 or something.. [Doug] Because I'm normally in New York around girls most of the time it was a strange experience to be in a sort of "lad" environment. [laughter] Yeah, yeah... [Doug] Yeah, you do look similar - that's true. I just feel 20 years older than I am now... ... all of a sudden. Which is really odd. You know - he's lost all his cynicism and... Which was a good, you know, that was a good trait. It wasn't a bad cynicism - it was like... a hilarious sort of sarcastic sort of outlook on life and everything. but flippant and... yeah... whatever. I was very moved. I mean I can see that they love me a lot and... I think that, you know, that they all have trouble saying it because everything... ... anything emotional seems to be pretty repressed amongst them... I think anyone in the English culture, generally, it seems... [laughter] I think lots of people were... Cheers - Happy one year... Happy first birthday. - Cheers... cheers, guys. If that isn't the maddest thing I've ever said to you, I don't know what is. [Rupert] It was an uncomfortable meeting, but really good to see everyone together. On the surface it looked like things were back to normal but deep down, we knew they weren't. When Pete's wife Alessia arrived, I wondered that maybe Doug had more in common with Edward, his new godson, than he did with us. Go and meet your godson. Wow. Check that out. There you go! [music - Pryda Animal] [Jim] I want him to get his memory back but he doesn't, so there's a bit of conflict. But as long as he's happy that's cool, but... I mean, if you ask anybody who knows him, you definitely want him to suddenly ring you up and go... "Hey - I'm back!" [Charlie] He lives in New York - I live over here. But I don't suspect for a second that it's gonna develop to how it was before. I mean, he doesn't remember... ... doesn't remember me, doesn't remember other people but he's still Doug. [Doug] They're great... I mean, I like them a lot. They seem like good people. And I have no problems about seeing them again, hanging out. If they want to come and see me, that's cool - it's no problem. Have a great summer, and... and I'll see you... well, I'll speak to you this week from New York or something. Okay? Do you want me or Narelle to come with you? [Alessia crying] [Rupert] Everyone from Doug's past had to accept that the old friendship had been lost... and we'd all have to make the effort to become close friends again. [Alessia] Thank you for coming. Hey, it's no problem. Thank you for coming. I'm so proud of you. Yeah... oh, come on, I'll walk you back. [Rupert] Before he came to London, Doug had met and fallen in love with an Australian girl called Narelle. Now we had some serious competition on our hands. [Narelle] It's true, what I am saying. - [Doug] Do you know where we are? - I'm always right. Yeah, I do - we're at the Ritz. [Rupert] Now this is first love. [Doug] Right, I mean, yeah, the first time I felt real, um, yeah... real love. It's intense - I mean, it's all-consuming, it's, um... I don't think of anything else when I'm with her, it's, um... It's just amazing. I'm so happy to have met her. She's the most wonderful, loving, caring person, funny, beautiful... [Narelle] Well, to be honest, when I met him for the first time, I didn't know. It's not like she introduced me... "Hi, this is Doug, the guy with amnesia." It wasn't anything like that. It's not something that I would have ever noticed. [Rupert] So how long have you two been going out for then? Eleven weeks and four days. [Narelle] If you're asking me to pinpoint why I love Doug... because he's a very genuine, loving, beautiful, wonderful person... and... he has no faults... - [Doug laughs] - ...yet. [music - Sibelius "Valse Triste"] [Doug's father] He seems to have slowly begun to reintegrate himself with his friends - which is important - and with his family, which makes me very happy. [Marina] I think he's, you know, he's found himself. It sounds a bit tacky, but... I think he has, and he's built himself a little life. And he's a lot more confident and comfortable with who he is now than when he first came. I think it was maybe a bit too much for him... ... to take in at once anyway. [music] [Marina] He's had the great opportunity to reinvent himself and become a completely different person. And not many of us get that chance. You know, start afresh and... put behind all the things we wish we'd done differently or wish we hadn't done at all. And every day is a new day and brings new things, and he learns from it. You know, we tend not to do that. We get sort of stuck in our daily routine and... ... and we don't learn daily. [father] The family has always felt that, you know... misfortune will always come in a lifetime. And you have to know how to treat it. [strange electronic music] [Rupert] After seeing his family, Doug went surfing in Biarritz. Out on the waves, the swelling on his pituitary gland - - first spotted by the doctors in Coney Island - ruptured. He suffered excruciating headaches and blinding flashes of light. The French doctors recommended he return home to his neurosurgeon. In New York, the scans indicated that Doug was not in any immediate danger, but he had to wait six months for his final checkup. If the tumor had regrown, he would need brain surgery. [doctor] Hello, how are you? - Hello. - Nice to see you. - Good to see you. - Nice to see you, too. Do you guys have a new MRI, or you had it here at Sinai? - I had it here, two days ago. - Two days ago, okay. I didn't bring my old films. I forgot this morning - I'm sorry. That's fine. - And how have you been feeling? - Uh, good, I think. I haven't really had headaches or anything like that. So it's been pretty good. And what about your vision? Have you had any trouble reading or... No, sometimes bright lights still hurt. Hurts? Or bothers you? I mean it's a sharp pain or dull pain? - No, it's a dull pain. - It's a dull... But it's not sharp at all. It's like this neon light is bothering you right now? Yeah, if I was to look at it. I mean, no, but if I look at it. - Sometimes bright daylight does it a bit. - Okay. But it's not as it was when it hemorrhaged in Biarritz, so... So here are the pictures on the computer, and we're just going to look at them. What we're looking at is the area where the lesion was, and... ... there is really not much there to speak of on this sequence. [Narelle inhales deeply] ... but we obviously need to look at... all the different sequences and so here is where the pituitary gland is, and it looks very normal. - Oh, wow. - And, uh... same there. I couldn't see a cyst today and I couldn't see a cyst... So it's retracted, you would say? That's fantastic. That's really good news. Um... right. That's really great. Um... - Thank you, for this. - Okay. So, um... The only question which I think I've asked you before, is if you think this could have triggered my memory loss. We see a lot of patients that have hemorrhages in the pituitary for other reasons, like tumors and such, and I don't remember ever seeing somebody with the same degree of memory loss that you have. And so whenever we see something that is out of the ordinary, - it's always difficult to explain. - Right, right. Is it possible that the hemorrhage caused this alteration in your memory circuitry? And the answer is yes, it's possible. Is it common? And the answer is absolutely not. The bottom line, for what I'm concerned, is that you do not need any surgery. [laughter] - That's the bottom line as far as I'm concerned. - That is the bottom line. Excellent. Well, thanks very much. - I really appreciate it. - Good seeing you. Good seeing you, too. - Take care, doctor. - Bye, bye. [Rupert] Nearly two years on, and no amount of tests or consultations could reveal a conclusive answer to his amnesia. The true nature of Doug's condition extends beyond the bounds of current medical technology. [eerie electronic music] [Prof. Schacter] For the most part, there really is no one place in the brain that you can point to and say, there's a memory. You can't go into the brain and just point your finger and locate a memory. It turns out that memories are much more distributed than that - ... distributed in different parts of the brain. This is especially so for episodic memories. So a memory is a network of brain regions and all those brain regions have to come together in order for us to retrieve a memory. So I think this helps us understand that there's a sense in which all memories are constructed. They're just not literal replays of events that have happened to us. [Rupert] Through the making of this film, I'd seen Doug undergo huge changes. And I'd like to think we've become good friends again. At home in his new flat with Narelle, he finally seems to be engaging with his past... ... which is strange, because my attachment to the old Doug is fading. I now only want him to get his memory back, if he does. [Rupert] Do you hope he gets his memory back? [Narelle] Yeah. Yeah, I mean, in a way it's a little bit scary to think about him waking up one day and having his whole life with him again in his memory and... you know, will he still be the same person and... will we still be in love? Will he still love me? You know that sounds silly but, um... Yeah, I guess in a way I want him to get his memory back. Twelfth of May, 16th of June, '83... What does this say? I took my Art O-Level - nine hours - and my teacher thinks I may have passed. I took German oral and got about 29 out of 50, which is encouraging. Played house cricket yesterday and got three wickets and a catch on the first 11 pitch. I tell you, these letters are so uninformative. [Doug] I would like to have been able to remember things as a child. I think that's got such a profound effect on everybody. It seems that those are things I would like to be able to remember. I wish I could remember my mother. I mean, I have pictures of her on the walls in the apartment and it seems that we were very close. So that's something, you know, that I feel I missed out on. [Doug] Part of a reason for the photo project is because I see memory as something akin to traveling in time. And everybody's got this ability to travel in time just by going back to places in the past that they experienced or whatever and... And I don't, you know. I don't have that. If you encode things and then, depending on who you are as a person, you remember them in a specific way and then sort of create this personal history which is a sort of bazaar, if you like, ...a bazaar of myths, of truths, of embellishments, of... all kinds of hotchpotches of distortions, and... ... and if that's, you know, if that makes up who we are then... who are we really? Do you know? [electronic music] [Rupert] The doctors say Doug has a 95% chance of getting his memory back. But no one can tell him when that will be. What will it feel like when his new life and his forgotten past collide to form a new character he's yet to meet?
