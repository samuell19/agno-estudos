OUR HOME It was like awakening from a long dream. And soon I found out I no longer belonged to the world of the living. I found myself with the realization of an unexpected truth, life goes on through different stages. I woke up in another dimension, known as Umbral, sort of a purgatory. And my story was just starting over... Andr? Luiz! Come here, son. Did you talk to dad and grandma? Blessing, dad. Hi, grandma... Sit here for your breakfast... Feisty boy... Andr?! I lost all sense of time and space. I felt pain in my body and in my soul. It was a play of forces that I could not understand. All my knowledge was useless to me at that moment. The dream has become a nightmare. I was packed with jewels Here is your drink, sir. - A toast! - A toast. Andr?! Mariano, have you finished studying? Yes, daddy. You can go play now. As I thought about my past I realized that appearances do not always indicate reality. At times, our dark side is disguised by a false sense of tranquility, but one day it all comes back. And it is never too late. Get out, suicide! It's your fault! Get away, suicide! Murderer! You'll thirsty. This is my water... Get away! - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Thank you, Dona Sofia, see you. Thank you, doctor. Doctor? Please, do come in. C'mon, Antenor. - Are you all right? - Yes. Are you sure? I'm fine. Throughout this dimension of devastation, I would just survive. Hopeless, with no answers. I would breathe, hunger, felt cold, and fear. Forgive me, please, forgive me! I forgive you, my love. Forgive me! Yes, I do ask you to forgive me. Help. get us out of here. Oh my God, get us out of here. I regret it... Are you ok? Andr?! Andr?? Andr?? Dad, dad! Suicide! No! Suicidal! When I fell into despair, Someone help me! ...helpless, hopeless, I did the only thing that I could Mercy! Help me! Mercy! I don't know how long that prayer lasted coming from deep within my soul. But I was heard. Andr?. Not him! For God's sake, please help me. For the love of God help me... Help me, get me out of here. Calm down now. L?sias, Tobias! Easy now, your time has come, Andr?. Let's take him. We must reach the town with no delay, come on. Not him, coward, suicide! Suicide! I won't regret! To the Ministry of Regeneration. Sir, wouldn't the chambers be better? No, he will behave as a good boy. Welcome to "Our Home". Save your strength, Andr?. Hello, Andr?, how are you? My name is L?sias. L?sias, what is this place? What does it look like? I've never seen a hospital like this. Not on Earth. At least for now. This isn't Earth? Who are you people? Why did this happen to me? All your questions will be answered in good time, all right? Aren't you going to give me medication? May I? So anyway, am I dead or not? Dead? Your body died, Andr?, that's all. Don't move. Now you can eat. Soup, it's excellent. Hello Andr?, feeling better? Enjoy the soup? At least you don't feel hungry anymore. I'm sure you feel more yourself. L?sias, I need explanations. Much more yourself! This is no way of treating a patient. I need information about my condition. For now, all you need is treatment. I don't know whether you know, but I'm a doctor. I know what happened, I remember the hospital. You don't know how I suffered when they discovered my illness. Forty days in hospital, my wife, my children, seeing me suffer... Not to mention the shame. Then the impossible happens... I die and wake up in that awful place. With those monsters. Our brothers! Pity they don't see themselves as such. Brothers? Are you out of your mind? Where's that man who met me, is he your superior? Someone must tell me something! I'm not thirsty. It's medicine. Where? Put it in your mouth. Keep it in your mouth as long as possible, it'll do you good. No swallowing. Thanks. No swallowing. Speak, man. It's water, swallow it! Oh so it is! Thank you. Just as well you told me. How long have you been like this? All I know is that since I arrived I haven't had a moment's peace. And I never believed in life after death! I remember I was among my books, and suddenly I saw myself outside my body, and my friends came to take me to bury me... I lost my own self! I ended up in hell. How I suffered! And I asked myself, I don't know whether I'm dreaming, but if it wasn't a dream, that means God really does exist, right? Drink it! But I just drank the water... Drink some more, you need it, don't think twice. Don't swallow it. Stay like that for at least 5 hours, I'm tired and need to sleep. Maybe he should think about the life he had on Earth. Skepticism ends when you wake up in the spiritual world. You seem to understand the meaning of the water. The water of patience. Now you know too much complaining? Water. I can't rest until I know what's happening. Maybe you'll have some answers. Hi Andr?, my name is Clar?ncio. Clar?ncio, first of all, thank you for rescuing me, but I don't even want to think about the nightmare and injustice I have been through. What can I do for you, Andr?? I need explanations. Sure, sure, it's understandable, after all the suffering... It's a pity that you came here as a suicide. What? You don't know what you're saying. I'd never do that. Spiritual bodies keep a record of all actions of the material world. Then mine should show I had an illness which ended my life. Your illness is the result of a higher law. What law? Action and reaction. Moral behavior determines the history of a human being. I don't know what you're talking about. Who'd know that anger, hatred, envy, egoism, and intolerance would be part of a diagnosis. Besides, the organs of the somatic body have incalculable reserves, but can't endure year after year of mistreatment. Your gastrointestinal apparatus was completely destroyed from all types of excesses. Well, the words speak for themselves. Acts carried out year after year, the result is one only unconscious suicide. That's one explanation for such suffering. Hundreds and hundreds of creatures leave life on Earth for the same reasons every day. It's a true silent catastrophe. Now, Andr?, make the most of your time here and rest your spirit. Fretting won't solve any problems, the best thing in life is always to start over. Start over. There are numerous newcomers among us who are surprised by how similar it is to the Earth. They weren't told that mental creation is almost everything in life? They forget that energy vibrates in different dimensions and states? Yes, life goes on and relationships beteen beings serve this truth, no matter if you agree or not. The good we do is our advocate for eternity. Now, understand the grandness of this moment and the blessing which this city is for all. Andr?, I thought you'd be ready! What for? Minister Clar?ncio has authorized you to visit the city. But L?sias, like this?! Come, I'll teach you how to mentally produce other clothes. Andr?, did you enjoy Minister Veneranda's speech? I wonder how that image was created. And she said such amazing ideas. There were difficult moments here at the hospital. Now try to change your thoughts, my friend. L?sias, it's not easy going through all that. This recovery depends on that too, Andr?. It's the law of harmony. If I explode with rage I might return to that dark place? You never know, Andr?! Our feelings and thoughts rule our directions. I need news of my family. All in good time, remember? They were suffering so much with my illness. My parents? Are they here? My father, my mother? Oh, my God! So, you do believe. I thought you were one of those who say "I'm an atheist, thanks to God. " Little by little you'll know more. Just give it time. - Alright. - Let's get the Airbus. The what? Where do those energies come from? Soon engineers will to take similar technologies to the Earth. - What kind? - The use of magnetism, for instance. Life on Earth is a copy of here, Andr?. Being born, dying, being born again, many times, as many times as are necessary, it's the law. Hey, stop reading my thoughts! You're much better. I don't know why. People who complain have no time for smiling. Dr. Andr?. What a surprise! God in heaven, you here? Don't you remember me? Dona Am?lia, you always used to see me at the end of the day... me and my husband, you never charged anything. Ah yes, you had headaches. Stomachache. Of course, are they better? Well, I died. I'm much better now. I'm waiting for Antenor. He was very sick, remember? But he just won't get on and die. Madam, excuse me, but Dr. Andr? is still a newcomer. I'm sure you came straight here. You didn't have to go to that horrible place. You're a good man, no mistake. You came straight to "Our Home". As soon as you start seeing people, I'll make an appointment. Thank you, Dona Aur?lia. Am?lia! Am?lia. When that happens, better not say anything. Thanks for the advice. You could be a minister. I'll tell you a bit of the history of this place... but pay attention, I'm only saying it once. Agreed? Agreed. The building in front of us is the Ministry of Elevation. "Our Home" was built in the 16th century, there is a reason and a sense for everything here, as you shall see. That's the Divine Union, they deal with matters of higher spheres, next is the Governance Palace. Enlightenment and Communication, which handle research and messages to family members on Earth, among other things. You're in the Ministry for Regeneration, which stands alongside the Reincarnation Pavilion. Which I must confess I rather dislike. Why? One day you'll find out. The main square holds a ministry on each of its six points of the star. There are 72 ministries in the city, like the names of God. I lived under this new paradigm. I saw people parting for rebirth on Earth but leaving sadness behind. Little by little, it all started to make sense. "Our home" was the real existence. And life on Earth was just a stage. You won't make it. How do you know? I've gotten lost plenty of times on these paths. Unless that's the intention. I want to see my family. You think that's possible? One day, who knows? I was still the same man, imprisoned in my own mistakes... in my ego... in my past. Doctor! Dr. Andr?! Excuse me, may I interrupt? Of course, in any case I must do a lot more research. My pleasure, Emmanuel. Pleased to meet you, Andr? Luiz. I'd like to know how to send a message to my family. To tell them I'm here, that I think about them... in fact there's so much I don't know where to start. This is where you start. Have you been told how it works here at the Ministry for Communications? You choose the technology, those of the future or of the past. The older ones, that I know. Please. Do you think this will make her less sad? I know she's been suffering a lot, since I left. Jonas, your mother won't suffer anymore, knowing you're fine... With all the details you tell her. - What do we do now? - Now you wait, I'll let you know when you have permission to dictate it. We have a brother incarnate who is ready to channel through writing all messages we can send. Thank you. Andr?, is it hard to get started? That's true. It is always like that. Why don't you go to brother Gen?sio at the Ministry ofAssistance, there you'll find what you're looking for. Minister, excuse me, may I see you in private? Excuse our brother. I'll give you the necessary assistance after them. But I'll be really quick. So will they. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Andr? Luiz! I see people in pairs. Thank you very much, minister. Ladies first. What can I do for you? Minister Gen?sio, I need to see my children on Earth. The poor things are suffering so much with my departure. Although family ties are not broken with the temporary separation of death, it is a just request. How many bonus hours do you have to justify the request? Through working, none at all. How long have you been at the colony? It's been six painful years. And during this time haven't you found anything to interest you? I never needed to work. You know that "Our Home" offers everything from food factories, to services for visiting friends in recovery. It's all a bit tiring, isn't it? All merit is achieved through work. So they say. Assess your deeds, sister, and see how impregnated they are with pride and egotism. These are the great burdens of humanity... All forms of serving are a blessing. Sir, excuse me, so can I go back to being a doctor? It's up to you, but perhaps a doctor on Earth isn't the same as a spiritual one. What can I do? You must know that will, persistence and merit go hand in hand. When a worker is ready, the work appears. Let's look for some work, sister. An ocean of invisible matter surrounds the Earth. The city of "Our Home" sits on the top of a range of spiritual mountains. It is merely one among thousands of cities that hover over our Planet. Rectification Chambers. Welcome, sister. Welcome. Rectification Chambers. This may not be the heaven you dreamed of, but we'll care for everyone with love. Has my niece arrived? On that stretcher. Eloisa! I never understood the potential of our mind. Here in the city, many would still look as they were on Earth. The changes would have to be deeper. Uncle, I never thought you'd receive me when I died. You need to drink. Eloisa. Mother was so sad when you died, it was so sudden. She always prayed for you. I know. How? The first hours are the worst. Very soon the pain will pass. You've suffered a lot. L?sias, - What happened to her? - I don't want anyone's pity. We'll look after you, Eloisa. I don't need looking after. Uncle, help me to go back. My fianc? is waiting for me. Eloisa, I'll take you to our home here. Your grandmother Laura and your aunts Judite and lolanda are expecting you. Uncle, I don't have a home here. Uncle, send me back, please! Eloisa, calm down and rest, I'll prepare your discharge. Andr?, take the opportunity to watch, there is much to learn here. Thank you, L?sias. Everything will be fine. Don't tell me to relax. How do you feel? Alive and dead at the same time. You know, I've never heard a better definition. Who are you? I'm a doctor, Dr. Andr? Luiz. Then explain this. Why do I still feel such pain? Could you sit up a little, please. If you'll just allow me to examine you, that's it. Won't I stop suffering, even after death. Take a deep breath. That's it. Does it hurt here? And here? My God! Calm down! Easy! Easy! - Get your hands off her, please. - She needs help! Hands off! Thank you. What happened after all? What did I do to her? Was she having a fit? More or less, I would say. I know, I'm sorry, I'm a general practitioner. Earthly diplomas! So what happened? If she was already dead, then why... Oh, you were doing research? No, I'm trying to learn. And help, too. Help? Of course, I need to work. Really. What for? I want to visit my family on Earth. So I need merits. You want merits? Yes, isn't that how it works? - You really want them? - Yes, I want merits. Come on, then. Our brother needs cleaning, you can start here. But that's nurse's work! Do you want them or not? But I can be put to use in other ways. I studied so much in life. What do you know about spiritual medicine? I know nothing. But I want to learn. There are so many new laws here, or other ways of applying old laws. No. The laws are the same, but are applied individually. What's happening to me? Did you gather your strength? Child, darling, wherever you are, I'll always love you. I wish from the bottom of my heart that you be at peace, and with God. Nice, that prayer of your mother's. What about my fianc?? Hasn't he prayed for me? Does he know that life goes on? We never talked about that. This couldn't have happened to me... we loved each other and were about to get married. Has love ended just because you've left? How can I leave here? As soon as your uncle comes to get you. Now rest and try not to think of anything. So my friend, how are you? - I owe you an apology. - No. We only apologize to those who feel offended, which is not my case. I didn't wish to harm her. Do patients look after patients? You were giving her fluids coming from your frail mind. But I'm not a suicide! That's not what we're talking about. I'm sorry. Andr?, you're not ready yet, but you will be. Tobias, see our brother out of the chambers. When he was born, you devoted yourself to raising a good man. And when he died, the devotion increased. It's not an easy task, Clar?ncio. You were there with us, you know that. Yes, but you've been doing your best, and will continue to do so. It took some time for me to accept the destiny he created for himself. It's tough seeing brothers struggling. Welcome to "Our Home", Luisa. I'm happy he's here. I think you'll be able to talk soon. Andr?, it's not worth telling people you're alive, it's no use. To know the truth human beings need some spirituality, in some form. Emmanuel, I don't have your faith. Did you get the authorization to send a message? Not yet. Andr?, why don't you go inside and speak to the Governor? Would he receive me? Here the leaders set examples. Welcome, Andr? Luiz. In my father's house there are many dwelling places. I wouldn't exchange our lovely Blue Planet to live anywhere, not even in the happy worlds. Thank you, Andr?, for coming to see me. Sir, I've come to beg your permission. Beg, Andr?? I need to see them. The family. Andr?, the family... You see, this is my family. Behind the walls, in the valleys of suffering, they are my family too. I also need to see them. But that is not what makes you suffer most. When you were found, you spoke from the heart. When the heart speaks, God speaks for us. Unconscious regret, my brother. Forgive me... I threw my life away. There are hearts praying for you. Which hearts? Son! Mom! Why didn't dad come to see me? Your father is in the nether regions. What did he do? I haven't the right to list your father's deeds. He's reaping the results, unfortunately. - Couldn't I... - No. no. No chance, for now. What about you? I approach, up to a certain level. I've been thinking, who knows, perhaps we could have another experience in the flesh? All sense of time is lost when you wake up after dying. It all makes sense, Andr?. I don't blame myself, but nor to I absolve myself. Do you have access to Earth? Don't ask me about Z?lia. Nor the children. My wife, my children! You're still a patient. They won't let me work. Here free will is also the law. You're a doctor, but above all you're a good man. I'm happy you're finding yourself again. Andr? Do you want to go on as a free spirit, or wait and see time goes by? Son, if you need me, I'll come. All you have to do is think. No, I don't want. No, no. Calm down sister, you'll get better, you'll get better. What's happening? Lie here, my brother, easy now, you're being cleaned. Tobias, what's going on? That's the job, Andr?. I'll be right back. Just one moment, please. I need you to call up more workers for this shift, otherwise we won't be able to cope. Calm down, you'll get help just calm down. Easy! Right. Rest assured, they will help you, you're protected, protected. Believe me, everything will be alright. That's it. Fine. Nurse Narcisa, I... You deserve a double bonus for your work. Andr? Luiz, now you're a member of the Rectification Chambers. And like all good workers, you know when it's time for a rest. Thank you, nurse Narcisa, but I have to work. Now it's time to stop. The quality of the work is essential. Don't overdo it. L?sias, I'm worried about where I'm going to stay. What? But you've only just started working. I didn't know I'd be discharged from the hospital because of that. Oh, Andr?! Not long ago I'd have thought you were complaining... that you needed water. I can't contain my curiosity. I'm sorry, were you a doctor or a journalist? How many people live around here? Around a million, in between arrivals and departures. How can I buy a house? Buy, Andr?? This isn't Earth, you know. You can't just accumulate, you need to deserve it, remember? Don't worry about that. Let's enjoy our dinner. I was at the hospital so long I've forgotten what a nice meal tastes like. You'll be amazed. Flowers from Veneranda! Our beloved minister. Dona Laura, you're too kind, I'd like to thank L?sias for this invitation. Andr?, this house is a conquest of all of us... especially my husband, who is already on Earth. That's true, I forgot to tell you, Andr?. My father took only 18 years to get this house. When you get yours I'll probably have been reborn. L?sias, now he's out of hospital Andr? is worried about his own situation. I don't want to bother you with this, Dona Laura. There's room for one more in our house, Andr?. I swore never to cook after disembodiment. But anyway, I just love it. Andr?, a special menu for you, today there'll be soup. Made with love. And water to go with it. Eloisa, granddaughter, you also need to reinvigorate your energies. Why are you all playing a happy family? Glad you liked it. Thank you. I can't wait to know our date. I'm sure we can be country folk, living on a lovely farm. My dear, you know I'm a city man. Watching you plan your next incarnation, it sounds so easy. But I'm sure we'll carry out what's planned. We've gone wrong so many times. Why are you so sure? The processes of incarnation aren't that easy, Andr?. It requires minute planning so that... Andr? Luiz? Dona Laura, I'm sorry. - Would you excuse me? - Of course. The minister will receive us shortly. I can hardly wait. Eloisa, have you ever imagined life after life? Do you know what you have to do to get back? I want to see how my fianc? is. Unfortunately, no. I need to go! There are more difficult cases than yours. Why don't you concentrate on your recovery? I don't care about the others, or about my recovery. I'm dead anyway, right? - You're privileged. - No praises, please. Take me, I never received those prayers from relations on Earth. Maybe no one liked you. Well, these took ages to find. It's been a while, right? There are just two files. What do you mean? Two people on record. Just two? Did you look up the right name? Andr? Luiz? There are no mistakes here, sir. Now just wait and the images will appear. Excuse me. Lord... bless Dr. Andr? Luiz, who was so good to me. May he receive all the love in this world. Bless his family... Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. How long since you saw my grandfather? He's already a 5 year-old boy. He's someone else? The same, but in a different body, to have new material experiences. I couldn't stand it. Sometimes we meet in dreams, when he can manage it. Oh, my granddaughter... one day you'll understand, you'll learn to deal with life's temporary separations. Family ties are eternal when built with love, everything that is the fruit of vanity and pride is painfully lost along the way. What if I don't want to understand, Grandma? If I don't want to hear all these lessons? I'm sorry. I missed you so much. I was with you. Dr. Andr?... my husband died and he's not here, he hasn't arrived yet... help me to recover him, you're such a good man, I need your help, help! Easy, dona Am?lia. Help me. Andr?, the world needs happy stories! Eloisa, it's not going to work. I'm not waiting years and years to go back. Now I'm the one reading your thoughts, doctor. You're dying to go, can't stand this moral tone anymore. Everyone has some advice for you, right? Let's go... we'll be truly happy! It's not going to work. It's our life, doctor, we have the right! No, we don't have the right. This book we've just finished dictating to the brothers on Earth tells the story of Roman Senator Publio Lentulus Cornelius whom you'll allow me to talk about in the 3rd person, since he was one of my incarnations. Galilee didn't know, but our times were changing forever. In those days Jesus Christ was around, the man who drew crowds with his miracles and his words, which echoed in every corner. And the Senator met this man one day in a dream. In an instant, a radiant instant, one capable of changing our existence forever. And if this instant goes away how many years will it take to rebuild the lost past? How many years does it take to rebuild a moment? In September of 1939, spirits of the upper hierarchy came down from the skies. The clarion was heard from far away. The city would face very important moments. Beloved brothers, citizens of "Our Home", ministers. As you know, our work helping those who come from the planet requires discipline, privations and great devotion. The process of renovation of human life has reached a boiling point. I come to ask for renewed efforts from those engaged in our colony's edifying services. A great war with a worldwide scope is starting. And we don't know yet when it will be over. Millions and millions of souls will soon return to the spiritual world. May God have mercy on us. All the spiritual cities around the planet unite in prayer and peace work. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me. L?sias! Unbalanced, obsessed with her fianc?, Eloisa would never manage to cross the thick layers of Umbral that surround the Earth from its surface to the borders of the city. The result: law of action and reaction. Eloisa! You were right, doctor, I didn't succeed. I never thought I'd say this to you, but one day all answers are revealed. All. Why am I like this? Why do I do people harm? One day you'll understand. When that day comes you'll feel a certainty, and you'll grow when the certainty is unshakable. This soup's horrible, it doesn't taste like anything. You know, Eloisa, I agree, but drink it for our friendship, it'll do you good. I learned a lot from you, thank you for everything. Get well. Narcisa, Clar?ncio. Anything I can do for you, Andr?? You already have, minister. You have. May I? At "Our Home" it is important to learn from all experiences, but there is one thing that we will never forget past can't be changed. Mysterious are the paths followed by heart and soul. And I saw once again what true love is capable of doing. Dona Laura, I know you don't need to reincarnate, so why go back to live on Earth? I asked and Minister Clar?ncio agreed. It is necessary to live again to evolve, there are lessons that only life on Earth can give us, and furthermore we've programmed a life which should go well. But you never know. Meanwhile, Dr. Andr?, take good care of Eloisa. I'm doing all this for her. Reincarnation is the best school. She'll join us as soon as possible. She'll be my daughter. I hope to be able to help her to accept more as her mother. And not be so tied to material things. Let's trust divine providence and have faith. So be it. Dona Laura, thanks for everything. Take care of my son, Andr?. I know, my friend, I know. How did your planning go, L?sias? Minister Clar?ncio is reviewing it. Apparently it'll take a while. Have you heard from them? Mother has been reborn. Aunts Judite and lolanda are in the process of forgetting the past. There's a great difference in everything you're feeling. How do you know what I'm feeling? Harmony. Because here all we ever say is: "see you soon". You say that because your mother lives in the higher spheres... and always comes to visit you. You haven't lost your mother. I have, philosophically speaking. She'll carry out all she planned and will help your niece. Now, read my thoughts. No... Yes. If you can, visit my mother. I don't even know how to behave with the incarnate anymore, L?sias. You might end up as a phantom. Yeah! When I arrived at "Our Home" I was the result of my life on Earth. I had marks of a life full of material gains but spiritually empty. In a way, that Andr? died during those years in the city. The man that thought he was the king of his domain, a man of anger, only concerned with the present, with his possessions, this man would no longer live. A new Andr? was born. Thanks for coming, Dr. Henrique. I do hope he'll be all right. Z?lia, you shouldn't worry that much. Tell me doc, will he get better? He just needs rest and to take all his medication. I don't think I could stand it a second time. Everything will be all right. I heard the same thing years ago. Call me whenever you need to. All right, doctor. Thanks for coming. Once again. Excuse me. The doctor said you'll be all right. Honey, the doctors don't know a thing. Men don't know anything. Look at this we're killing each other again. But I know, amore mio. And you'll be fine. - Your medicine. - Wait. Look at me. Come here. I love you, bela mia, I love you so much. I'm your husband who never failed you. Never, and never will. Mother? I'm so pleased you came, Clarice. How are you? Fine, a little frightened, but I'm fine. I thought a lot about father, today. Your father? That's all I need. What's wrong? I'm already upset and now you bring me more sadness? It's not the best time to talk about your father. I just wanted to tell you this feeling. Clarice, your father is no longer among us. I know it is painful. For me too. But it's part of the past. And the past is buried. Who's buried? Mother doesn't want me to talk about father. What use is it remembering him, Clarice? I just miss him. I don't know if I miss him. I'd like to. I read in a book that people don't die. - Clarice, please! - That's nonsense, sister. Science is here to disprove such fraud. Now you sound just like father. That's probably why I decided to become a doctor. How is Ernesto? Come on, let's see. Mother, I'm home! Maria Clara? Hi, Clarice! Who taught you that piece? I don't know. I just sat down and played it. Do you know how the rest of it goes? No. Do you know that I learned it when I was your age? Father loved watching me play. What was he like, Clarice? He was a good man. Very busy. He didn't have much time for us. He was strict, austere, I never saw him cry, you know? Men don't cry. That's right. I think he did what people expected of him. But he loved us. That's what counts, right? I don't get what you're saying. You don't have to. If things really turn out to be, the way I think they are, we'll meet again. Hopefully. Go on, play! Congratulations! Very nice. Life doesn't cease and death is a dark game of illusions. Closing the body's eyes doesn't decide our destinies. One must navigate in one's own drama or comedy until one has crossed all the paths of spiritual evolution, only then will one find the waters of the divine ocean. An existence is an act, a body, a garment, a century, a day, and death. Death is the breath of renewal. Did you know of this text? I couldn't imagine such an intense awakening.
