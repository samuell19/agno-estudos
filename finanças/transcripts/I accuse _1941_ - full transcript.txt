I ACCUSE Adapted from the Novel Mission nd Conscience by Starring Written by Music by Cinematography Sound Edited by Production Team Directed by Good morning. What have you got for me? - Registered mail for the professor. - Registered mail? - Where from? - Munich. - Hooray. Berta! - Ma'am, your signature! What? Sure, come in. Berta! Come! Berta. Berta! Leave That! Come on. - Thank you. Good-bye. - My pencil? - Sorry. Thank you. - You're welcome. Give him a tip. I must call Thomas. A letter from Munich. I?s very exciting! Hello? Hanna Heyt speaking. Put me through to my husband please. Oh, Berta, I opened it. Should I read it? - What is this letter? - I?s from Munich. The university. You know. Yes, Dr. Burckhardt? Can I speak to my husband? The professor is giving his lecture. Can I take a message? Please tell him to call me immediately. A letter has arrived from Munich. Yes, I'll tell him. Good-bye. - You're going to Munich? - I don't dare read it. I?s for Thomas. - Where is the professor? - He'll call me after his lecture. In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen... we have no idea what causes the diseases... that affect the central nervous system... which proves there is still plenty of new ground to cover in Medical Research. This keeps us modest. For how the mind works in relation to the brain... how awareness and abstract thought form in the nervous system... is something we know nothing about. Not yet. I envy you your youth... because you may live to see these puzzles solved. Please stay. I'm so nervous. Thomas has been waiting for this. I hope he hasn't been rejected. Yes, Thomas. The letter is here. From the university in Munich. May I open it? Hang on. Thomas! You got it! You're a professor in Munich! I'm so happy, Thomas! Just imagine, Munich! What? When? One second. Yes, starting in the fall. I have to tell Bernhard right away. He's waiting for the answer. Come home soon. Bye. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Congratulations. Where is Dr. Lang? I need to talk to him. At the clinic? Now? Please look after him. And he's screaming so loud. How did you know it was a boy? He takes after my husband. First, we'll get an apartment on Wiegermeier Strasse. The house will be sold, of course. We'll build a new one there. And the Alps are close by for skiing and climbing. Good for breaking your neck. Eduard, the fool, will be mad. I'll call him and rub it in. I therefore recommend... that you buy shares by the block. This way, our group would obtain the required majority. Yes? Majority, right? - Hello, Hanna. - See? Now we are going to Munich. And Thomas will be director of the Institute. See what a fool you are? Then I send my congratulations. Yes. You won't be able to pick on me. Phone calls to Munich are 1.20 marks. Tha?s per minute. You have to make peace with Thomas. I insist. Thomas likes you, but you've acted like a fool. - Well? - All right. When? How about tonight? Le?s celebrate tonight. I'll invite all our friends. I'll call back later. Berta! We'll celebrate tonight. I'll go shopping. There'll be at least 10 guests. Get Ella to help you. Yes? The doctor's still out? Tell him to call me back. He's not there. Well. - Meningitis. - Is it fatal? Yes, unfortunately. Doctor, can she stay home? I'd like to look after her myself. Mr. Straten will be here and Professor Schl?ter. And you know who else? Eduard too. - I'm happy to hear about your brother. - Time for him come off his high horse. I?s because of his money. He was afraid I'd lose mine and he might have to support me. Do we have enough wine? I think so. I'll check. What happened, Hanna? What idiot put the basket here? Did you hurt yourself? Yes. My foot. Tha?s because you always take three steps at a time. My hand hurts too. Should I look after the wine? I'll go. How much do we need? For Professor Schl?ter alone, we'll need three bottles. I have to give a speech. - Do you have to, Professor? - Of course the professor must. Yes, my young colleagues. The speech is a must. Silencio! - I?ll be at least a half hour. - Yes, he's working for his food. My friends, don't be afraid. The food has been very good. Excellent, in fact. Or did anyone not like it? So we must thank Hanna. Our friend Thomas is a great man. Now he's leaving us to become even greater. But where would Thomas be without his wife? He is a quiet scholar and serious researcher. She is his good fortune and life itself. Tha?s how it is. One complements the other. For each one alone is completely different. - Come in. - Are they still eating? They've just finished. Then I'll eat with you in the kitchen. Then again, the two are quite similar. Thomas has his lab at the clinic where he does his research... with his microscope and flasks and apparatus... the whole scientific arsenal. While Hanna, here in this house, has the arsenal of life. All the things they have here. Look at the small coach over there. It surely reminds her of a special day. Over on the desk, the china dancer. It, too, must have a happy meaning for her. And then the picture over there. It was probably bought to keep a romantic memory alive. So tha?s why I raise my glass to them. Cheers. Cheers. This tastes great. Even better here, because I don't have to put on airs. Where were you all day? Hanna called many times. - Doctor's office, Berta. - We thought you wouldn't come. Berta, really. On such an important day? Hanna's brother is here. He's to make peace with the professor. Le?s drink to that, Berta. You make light of everything. Even as a boy. Dear Berta, let me tell you something. You've raised Hanna like a mother since her mother's death. I know. You stayed with her after she married Thomas, though he was disliked. But even you never thought he'd make professor. And who has said so from the start? I have. And you call this making light of things? But it was hard until Hanna inherited that money. - You weren't exactly starving. - Well, if it hadn't been for you- Exactly. The two of us are the true heroes. If you hadn't let me go dry, we could toast to that. - Are you going to Munich too? - If the professor will have me. Le?s clear the table. Here's to Hanna. - Bernhard. - Eduard. There you are. - I haven't seen you in a long time. - Yes. We were in opposite camps. Yes. You should have married her. He's a genius. Thanks to you. He's my friend. I also always thought Bernhard would marry her. See? Must be boring in there. All those doctors. Imagine a metastasis of an abscess... following surgery for sepsis of the arm. Things you wouldn't believe. - Where is Eduard? - I don't know. - Now i?s your turn. - Well, my dear Professor. Pain is doubtlessly Go?s idea. He wanted childbirth to be painful. Or he would have done it differently. Pastor, you don't know your Bible. When God created Eve from Adam's rib, he put him in a deep sleep. Tha?s proof that God is in favor of anesthesia. You? Here? What are you doing here? - Family meeting. Come sit down. - I have to attend to my guests. - Hanna. - Bernhard. I missed you. Where were you all day? The clinic, Hanna. - Say, are you limping? - I?s nothing. I fell down the stairs. Don't start that medical jargon. There's enough next door. - Have you seen my wife? - I think she's outside. You'll dance with me later. There you are. Look at you. Come, le?s see our guests. - Did you miss me? - Of course. - Good day, Bernhard. - Hello, Thomas. - Nice of you to come. - My hearty congratulations, Thomas. Thank you. They're dancing in there. We should go too. - Can you dance with that foot? - Sure, I can. Well? Well. You have to see it as a businessman. I just can't understand it. Losing one's only daughter... to a researcher at a small university, and on top of- You think only in percentages. Yes, Doctor. But you still accept your brother-in-law? Yes, sure. Your candor is almost endearing. - Cigar? - Thanks. I'll go into surgery. I have always wanted to do that. Isn't it terrible to cut off arms and legs all day? No, I quite enjoy that. The professor is the greatest researcher I know. He will be world famous. Sounds like you've got a crush on him. Why? I?s nothing to do with a crush. Remember how you beat me up in elementary school? Yes, when you called me socialist. You had good reason. But... we were friendly then. We can be now, if you want. I'll get him. I'd like to see your institute. Can I see Dr. Burckhardt as well? Yes, of course. She's a hard worker. - Here's Bernhar?s cello. - Still playing trio? Yes, we're very musical. I'd better say good-bye. I think I'm being called away. - Shame. - Good-bye. Everyone should have an examination every six months. It will be made into law, believe me. There's the cello. Now we'll hear the trio play, right? - We promised. - Well, friends, le?s get ready. We won't have many more chances to hear them. Come over here. I like music, but not so close. - Wha?s that? - Don't know. The air is clean of sound. We can go back now. - Tha?s odd about the hand, right? - Yes, odd. A doctor on every finger, but no one knows wha?s wrong. - Good-bye. - Thank you. Great performance, too. Many thanks. Let me tell you... - it was also a great day for me. - Glad to hear that. Good-bye, son. - Wha?s with your hand? - A little nervous. Don't get her started, or we'll have our first fight ever. Come, Bernhard, leave the young ones. We'll go for drinks. - Bernhard and drinks. - Why not? You don't have time for that. Tell me, he doesn't go for drinks because he's so busy... or does he work so much so that he doesn't go drinking? - You're so smart. - I'll get him home. Good-bye. Don't talk about me behind my back. Now le?s go for a drink. - Will it be this nice in Munich? - Even better. - What Schl?ter said was nice. - Yes, it was. The Hanna anthem. What sort of memento would you like for tonight? Have you thought of something? We could use a picture here. - Good night. - Good night, Berta. - Do you need my help? - No, go to bed. We'll do that tomorrow. You must be very tired. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. So beautiful out here. What should we wish for if we see a shooting star? We don't need that. Isn't life wonderful? Yes, because of you. - I just thought of a picture. - What? Us. Oh, Thomas. - Can you help me with that? - You should see a good doctor. - I have one. - No, i?s not from your fall. See Bernhard. If necessary, he'll refer you to a specialist. Yes, you. I specialize in cutting bodies open to see what went wrong. Bernhard will diagnose you. We can't do that at the lab. Make an appointment. It can't hurt. Here. Now, I'm off to my lecture. - Too bad that can't heal my hand. - Silly. - Don't forget to see Bernhard. - Of course I'll see him. What do you think? Do you have an idea? I think so. I feel so strange. Just like everyone describes it. I haven't told Thomas yet. I have to know for sure first. Don't you think that the hand and foot are linked to that too? I know nothing about such things, dear. You've wasted all your time just with me. It was my pleasure. But I won't let Bernhard examine me. - But you can ask him. - He'll know more than both of us. I didn't want to keep you waiting. I don't need you now, Nurse. Yes, Doctor. - I'll check on the preparations. - All right. I'm worried about you. - Wha?s the problem? - Still the silly hand. And the foot is acting up again. - All stiff. - Yes, for two days. - It comes and goes, right? - Yes, but never this bad. - Does this hurt? - No. Take off your coat. What are going to do? Use electricity to see if i?s the muscles or the nerves. Nerves? I'm not nervous. - And the foot? - The ankle hurts a bit. Say, Bernhard... tell me. Could this mean I'm going to have a baby? I feel so strange and dizzy. Will you let me examine you? You? Not a chance. Have you examine me? We've been friends far too long for this. I almost married you... if you had asked me. That is, before I knew Thomas. But could my hunch be right? I don't know. That feels funny. Wha?s it for? Your muscles are fine. Tell me... what did you mean by dizzy and such? Well, i?s as if- as if I had stared into the sun. Then I feel dizzy. You see black spots? Yes. Maybe I should refer you to an eye doctor. Come on, I don't need glasses. - Do companies send these to you? - Yes. - As samples? - Yes. Free of charge? Yes. And who gets them? Whoever really needs them. What are you reading? You wouldn't be a very passionate husband. You don't know that I would have married you. Of course not. You're married to medicine. Come here, you psychologist, and sit down. - My wife is ungracious. - Tha?s doctors for you. For headaches, you prescribe castor oil... when a hand hurts, you stare into our eyes. Be quiet a moment. Staring into the abyss. Well, did you see something nice? The curse of beautiful eyes. Look to the right. No, nose straight ahead. Eyes to the right. Eyes left. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Don't tell me. I already know. Having a baby is not a disease. Yes? We're done here. I'll see you tonight or tomorrow? Good-bye, you serious man. Good-bye, Nurse Emma. He looked deep into my eyes. Is something wrong, Doctor? Call the lab. I must talk with Professor Heyt urgently. All clear. 56-82. Typhoid BC negative. 56-83. Typhoid BC negative. - 56-85. - What about 84? Low on serum. I've ordered a new one. People are different. I couldn't live without my work. Too bad. A real pity. Hertenberg says that all lines of human conflict converge into marriage like a focal point. And the conflicts are carried out in the third and fourth dimensions of marriage? No thanks. But the marital hostilities actually end after- Just a minute. 56-85. Typhoid negative. B: 1-100 positive. 1-200 plus, minus. The marital hostilities end after the first child. And C: Negative. Children, yes, but why get married? - Hello, Doctor. - Hello. - Is your boss around? - Yes, in his office there. 56-86-Typhoid BC. - Hello. - Hello, where's the fire? One second. Just sit down. Sorry, but I'd like to finish this thought first. - Bernhard. - Hello, Thomas. So, Hanna came by. She didn't want me to examine her. Probably for the best. She also gave me a tough time. I only checked her reflexes and her eyes. I see. Her bones and muscles are fine. - But the nerves- - Hanna and nerves? Impossible. Temporal pallor of the optic disc... central scotoma... - paralysis of the left hand. - Yes. And? Multiple sclerosis. My God. Tha?s a death sentence. What makes you think that? I?s a very rare condition. No, what she will have to go through. You know I was an assistant in the neurological department. Yes, of course. - I?s incurable, right? - Some, certainly not all. I wish I were wrong. We must consult a specialist. Who do you suggest? Werther. He's the best. You know what? I don't believe it. Look, Bernhard, that disease in Hanna. She's healthy as an ox. Listen Bernhard, don't be angry... but I know how you feel about Hanna. We never talked about it, no need. But do you think i?s possible... that you let your subconscious influence you? Possible. But make sure you don't let your subconscious blind your judgment. Werther has to come, obviously. - What did she say? - Nothing. She doesn't know. - Is she feeling ill? - Sure. But she thinks she's going to be a mom. Good God. Did you examine her? No, she refused. I only looked at her eyes. Bernhard, Hanna is no case for you. You normally examine with your reason... and here you use your heart. And the heart is like a magnifying lens. I'll go and see Hanna. Dr. Burckhardt. - See to it that Werther examines her. - Yes. I'm going home. When I'm done, should I phone you with the results? No, don't. Come, Bernhard. Good-bye. Thomas. You've brought me flowers? What a surprise. You always give me nice things. You're smarter than we thought. - Who's we? - Berta and I. How nice- That silly hand. You should have yourself examined. Do you think so? Bernhard thinks so too, but I didn't want to. But if you say so- Sure. What are you thinking? Don't tell me. I'm always thinking it too. The diagnosis is correct, unfortunately. No doubt, it is a severe and incurable type. What a shame. Are you going to tell your wife? - Don't tell her. - I don't know- Absolutely not. I?s like telling a prisoner the date of his execution. - You can determine the date? - Of course not. There's no way of telling, but Mrs. Heyt is seriously ill. Such patients are often euphoric to the last moment. Nobody knows why... but it may be a factor in accelerating death. How do you assess the progression of the illness? Well- We're colleagues. Don't hold back. First, her legs will be paralyzed, and she won't be able to walk. Then she'll lose her arms and have to be fed. Everything beautiful in life, nothing will be spared! What can be done? Rest, arsenic treatment. I'm not giving up. I won't think of it. I'll fight it. My lab is one of the finest. Nerve specialists don't agree on the origin of the disease, right? - Unfortunately not. - There you go. I've informed myself. Maybe you're too specialized. Maybe the cause is to be found in another area. It could be a blood disease. I know i?s your specialty... but how can you link that to multiple sclerosis? The central nervous system is not only made of nerve tissue. There are fluids as well. Maybe some deficiencies in the blood create substances... that, directly or indirectly, destroy the nervous system. Original, and highly interesting. But this work would take years. Maybe I can do it faster with luck. I won't give up. Of course not. A real doctor never gives up. And pardon me for saying so... a loving one doesn't either. - Anything else I can do? - Thank you, Professor. - I'll request some material. - You'll get anything you want. - Good-bye. - I'll see you out. In my estimation, her paralysis is progressing rapidly. Once it reaches her respiratory system, the choking spells will start. No, damn it! You must think I'm crazy. The moment has passed. - Thomas- - Just don't tell me to be reasonable! Just don't tell me I'll come to terms! I know that one. I've told patients the same thing myself. - You're not giving up? - Of course not, but this is something new. First, I believed in diseases... treatable diseases. But then I realized these are only words, names. In reality, there are only sick people. But now if I imagine I'm fighting multiple sclerosis... then i?s a disease again, attacking Hanna. A word, a term, nothing real, something I can't touch. What is this substanceless monster that is sneaking up? - But tha?s our profession. - Our profession. If I must lie to myself, in order to lie to my sick patients. Kindly refrain from lying to me too, I'm not sick. Not yet, but pull yourself together. We'll hire two more technical assistants and Rueger will help us. - Maybe a pathogen is the cause. - But no one has found it yet. - People often find what others overlooked. - Yes, Dr. Burckhardt. Why couldn't we find the pathogen? Leave nothing out, maybe i?s cerebrospinal fluid or blood changes. Le?s summarize. You, Dr. Burckhardt are in charge of histology... Dr. H?fer will handle the cultures... and I'll run tests on the cerebrospinal fluid. If he's lucky, he'll find something. But should he use his lab for private research? I?s not private. If he finds something, he's not just helping Hanna, but thousands. Do you think it possible, he'll find something in time? A crap shoot. We talked to Werther in detail. He says i?s the nerves. He doesn't think i?s- No, Hanna. I don't want to lie to you. He doesn't think you're having a baby. I was so looking forward to it. I?s all pointless now. But Hanna. Hanna! My God. Hanna! - How many sections, Doctor? - About a hundred. Can your colleague help me? - If he doesn't faint. - I've never fainted, Doctor. Not even during the first semester. Don't let her fluster you. She only wants to demonstrate the strength of women. Come with me in the tiger's den. Bring your records. We've finally done it. The mouse has been infected. Dr. Burckhardt. Come quick. Yes, wha?s going on? Look. The mouse is paralyzed. Great, isn't it? Poor animal. The first success in three weeks, and she says, "Poor animal." There. Be good. Take your medicine. I think you're using me as your guinea pig or something. What is my disease? Don't you know? - Not exactly. - But it can't go on like this. I can't move either leg... and my right arm is acting up too. I can't spend my life lying around paralyzed like that. Maybe we'll find a good treatment. - Are you thinking about it? - Of course. - Is that why you look so tired? - No. - You can tell me. - No, Hanna. I spent the last two nights watching over a child. - What child? - One with meningitis. I need to be there because the child may require heart medication. Does it help? Maybe the child will survive. I?s hard to imagine there are others who are sick too. Strange. - I'm not all that sick. - No. You're a good doctor, right? - And Thomas? - He's a researcher. I can help individuals if I'm lucky. He helps thousands. Does he think of me too when he works? - All the time. - Yes? He comes home really late now. New research, he says. Is he thinking of the healthy Hanna who doesn't exist anymore? Why don't you answer me? You know how he thinks of you. You, the way you are. - How long has the test been? - Four weeks now, Professor. - Still the only sick mouse? - Yes. Then its paralysis was probably caused by injury from the injection. Too bad. We need to run a new test. Try a brain mash instead of injections. Yes, Professor. - How many sections left to analyze? - About 120. It needs to be done. You have time? Of course. I think we're over the hump. The fever is gone. Doctor! L- Don't celebrate yet. There may be a relapse. But I'm happy too. I think it will be good now. Immersion. - How can you stand it? - No wonder with me... but you, I'm grateful to you. 10:00, and he hasn't called. He doesn't have time to think. But you're supposed to think of him all day. Half of that crazy disease comes from him not being here. Stop it, Berta. Or I'll send you away and won't speak to you. Hanna. I mean well. Sure, the professor. I shouldn't say anything. See? He's here now. - Good evening. - Good evening, Berta. Good evening, Hanna. - Haven't you eaten yet? - No, I've waited for you. I'm tracking something important. And time is of the essence. I'm sorry. - I'd like to take a trip with you. - We will soon. To Munich. No. I want to go to a land where there is no disease. Poor animal. I haven't forgotten you. There. Soon you'll feel no more pain. I?s nice of you to always come yourself. I?s just a pretext for me. If you leave the bottle, will you still visit? Don't tempt me. Leave the bottle here. See what you made me do? Now there are too many drops. One more or less won't matter. You don't understand that. Now I know. You're poisoning me. You know I'm seriously ill, and you're all keeping it from me. I've felt it. You're afraid to leave the bottle. I might drink it all at once, silly as I am. I still have courage. I still believe I'll get better. But you don't. At least tell me the Latin name of my disease. How would that help you? You won't? Thomas will tell me. But I want to ask you for something else. Now, while I still can, because I don't think i?ll happen... but I ask you, just for the worst case... if I keep getting worse- I can see wha?s coming. My legs are paralyzed, the left arm is gone... the right one's starting to go. You know, I am not afraid of dying, but I don't want to just lie there. For years, not being human, but only a lump of meat. It would be a torment for Thomas if I deteriorated like that. And when he thinks of me... when I'm dead... he'll be glad. And I don't want that at all. - You're my best friend. - Always. Then forget to take the bottle with you. You're mad. Surely, you're not that sick. Promise me that you'll help me when I am. Promise me that you'll spare Thomas and me. Listen, Hanna. I'm your best friend. But I'm also a doctor, and a doctor is a servant of life. He must preserve it at all costs. May a doctor delay death if he can? Of course. But he must not shorten the pain of death? - No. - Why not? Because we don't know what death is. We don't even know what life is. Life creates the body... and the body creates the mind and soul. As long as the body lives, things can still improve. Tha?s very well thought out. There. We think i?s a new pathogen. Well done. But it has nothing to do with multiple sclerosis. Unfortunately, no. - So what will you do with it? - We'll try to cultivate it. With what? We use tissue cultures. Look. Well, I'll be! Tha?s great. You just did that on the side. Your boss must be proud. No, he's disappointed. He's only thinking of his wife. Yes, that would cloud his judgment. What do you do as part of your experiments? You wouldn't understand, child. Thomas, I understand precisely. You're trying to find a cure for my disease. Yes. I?s nice that this is the reason you leave me all alone. So you're also thinking of me when you're at the lab. The disease is incurable? No, Hanna. You can tell me the truth. I believe in you. I know you'll succeed. I'll be patient. Why are you giving me poison? To buy time for my work. So, it is incurable. For the time being. Sometimes I've felt so sick... and I've never told you. I've even thought... "If I die now, he won't be here with me." Tha?s the worst. Promise me, Thomas... if the disease is faster than you... don't leave me alone. No, don't say anything. When I get worse, you must help me. You must help me remain your Hanna... to the very end. Before I turn into something else... deaf, blind or demented. I couldn't bear that. You would then have to learn to love another woman. And it would hurt me so much. Promise me, Thomas, that you'll release me before that. Do it, Thomas, if you really love me. Do it. L- I'll make you healthy again. Still nothing. And Hanna? The disease is progressing rapidly. Is there any hope left? I?s a race. A race against death. Of course I'm very sick, Eduard. I know that. But inside, I'm healthy... because I believe in Thomas. - Don't you? - Yes, I do. I believe in his abilities. He will help me. One way or the other. - Is this the first new test series? - Yes. Take a look. Either I'm crazy, or I really see something. You're right. A silver lattice. You see it too? In both preparations? Yes. Here too. - Take another one. - Same for my other sections. They could be elementary bodies. They must be. I think i?s the pathogen. My God. What do you see? A caterpillar-like silver lattice. Axon cylinders intact. Myelin destroyed. Connected hexagonal plates. Some are striped. Bundles of needle-shaped crystals. A perfect match for what I observed. - What do you think it is? - Elementary bodies of a virus. Much like small pox. Multiple sclerosis!! Excuse me, please. Yes? Excuse me. Dr. Burckhardt? You're here? Yes. Who are you? Oh, Mr. Stretter. The professor is over there. - Do you always work late? - Right now, yes. Yes, I thought so. You'll find the professor behind that door over there. Thank you. I?s quite interesting, a lab like this. Yes? Well, well. - You're a sight. - Why? You're totally exhausted. Guess what. I think we've isolated the disease. - We who? - Barbara and I. - I?s about Hanna's health. - Stop pretending. - Wha?s wrong? - Not my business, but you have good taste. I don't know what you want. I know what people are like. Drop your act. But I pity Hanna. Poor Hanna. Leave Hanna out of this. What I've seen here is all I need to know. - I was right after all. - Of course. The healthy one is always right, Thomas. Have you been crying? No. I still have hope. I'll cure you, Hanna. I just isolated the pathogen. - Yes? - Barbara thinks so too. She's objective. We saw it at least a dozen times. I'm so happy. Oh, Thomas. I can't move my arm anymore. - Calm down. - I can't move my arms. I told you. You will walk again. You will raise your arms again. I'll work the whole night. I'll go back to the lab. No, stay here. I am always afraid I may die when you're not here. - It is too late now anyway. - Don't say that. No. Help me, Thomas. Help me. I'll cure you. - You worked all night? - Yes. I'm wonderfully tired. Success makes for really good sleep. I'll take a look and make new preparations. Go home and rest on your laurels. I'll just let the boss know. No need to console me today, Pastor. I'll be dancing again two months from now. I'll play a waltz for you then. I think anyone as gay as your are must be devout as well. You won't get me like that, Pastor. But it sounds nice. My pain is only half as bad, now that I know I will be cured. I see it. This pathogen has nothing to do with multiple sclerosis. I'm sorry, Professor. But i?s still a great discovery. Substances of the new agent likely combined with the destroyed tissue. This will open up new possibilities in histological diagnostics. New possibilities? For you, perhaps, but not for me. You can go to Munich in my place. But Professor. Please leave me alone. You see, Hanna? Everything will be all right. A doctor must never give up hope. Miracles do happen sometimes. - Am I dying? - No, Hanna. Call Thomas. Yes, Hanna. Leave it. I don't want to be disturbed. I'll get the professor. He won't answer the phone. - Professor! Come quick! - Wha?s wrong? I think i?s the end. He's coming. Thomas. I can't- I can't take it anymore. Stay calm. I'll talk to Bernhard. He'll help you. No, don't go away. I'll stay here. It won't take long. Tell me the truth. What is her condition? - The final stage. - You know that for sure? I've seen it many times. - How much longer? - Two months. - Two months of terrible pain? - Yes. And it can't be stopped? - Can we keep it from her? - Not anymore. What can we do? Keep her calm. Morphine. Thank you for your candor. I'll give you your medicine now. So you can sleep. Yes, Thomas. It has a very bitter taste. I'm so tired now. So happy. Remember, Thomas... how I came to you... after running away from home... and I was so afraid... we sat just like this. I feel so light... so happy... like never before. I wish... this was death. It is death, Hanna. How I love you, Thomas. I wish... I could take your hand... I love you, Hanna. I love you, Thomas. Why are the lights off? Hanna is dead. Did you kill her? Set her free. Set her free? Is that what you call it? Thomas, what have you done? You've murdered her! Don't talk now! I know every word you would say! You took the most precious thing from her, her life. As a doctor, you have lost your honor. You never loved her. I know that now. She asked me too, but because I loved her, I didn't do it. Because I loved her more, I did it. Because her suffering was inhumane... because man must be above death... tha?s why I set her free. Tha?s it, Thomas. I'm through with you. I never want to see you again. Oh, Berta. He killed her. He said so himself. And Bernhard said so too. - Are you coming with us? - No, to the police. It complicates the assessment of your case. It could be disastrous for you... if you don't tell us how it happened. How can we pass fair judgment if you won't end your silence? You are charged with murder. Isn't there anything important that the court should know? You must have had a motive for your actions. I loved my wife very much. And? - Le?s hear from the witnesses. - Maybe we'll find some discrepancies. Witness Stretter, please. Witness Stretter. I bet he gave her some medicine he invented to try it out... - and he doesn't want to admit it. - Highly unlikely. Director Eduard Stretter, age 42, the deceased was your sister. - You can refuse to testify. - I want to testify. Tell us first about the relationship between Mr. And Mrs. Heyt. How did the accused meet your sister? We had known Thomas since childhood. We moved to northern Germany, while he studied in Innsbruck. My sister was still a young girl when Thomas lost his practice... - due to his medical views. - We're aware of that. He was in a bad way and came here because his friend Dr. Lang... who approves of his views, was willing to support him. He then met my sister again, who had turned 20. He managed to influence her, and she ran away from home. How did he do that? Do you have more details? She had childhood memories that he took advantage of. He seemed to care mainly about her money, because he wasn't doing well. My father reduced her share to the legal portion in his last will... and he died soon after... probably still haunted by these events. Still, she inherited a substantial sum. I think he was mainly interested in her money. He'd never had money. You know that Professor Heyt sacrificed his own health for months... working in his lab day and night to save his wife. - You saw it yourself. You were there. - Yes, tha?s right. But Dr. Burckhardt worked there too, and their relationship... - went beyond the job. - What makes you say that? Dr. Burckhardt also worked at the lab day and night... sacrificing her own health. My sister was sick for a long time, but she still clung to life. - And to her husband. - Unfortunately, yes. So you reported Professor Heyt to the authorities... because, based on your personal conclusions... you thought he wanted to kill her? I knew Professor Heyt since childhood as an excessive, brutal character. He beat you up many times when you were young. I know. - Any more questions for the witness? - Not at this time. - Defense counsel? - Yes, please. Director, do you think it is possible that the sick woman asked my client... to help her die? Is it possible? - Yes. - Thank you. Director, please be seated. Witness Helmut H?fer. Witness H?fer. - Simple case of murder. - I don't think so. Witness Dr. Helmut H?fer, age 28, assistant, not related to the accused. You work at the lab of Professor Heyt. - For how long? - Three and a half years. - You knew Mrs. Heyt? - Yes. What was the professor's relationship with his wife? He- He loved her more than anything. You had help at the lab? Yes, a technical assistant, and Dr, Burckhardt, of course. Dr. Burckhardt is a hard worker? Yes, diligent. Very smart for a woman I mean. Do you know about Dr. Burckhard?s personal circumstances? Dr. Burckhardt? Why? No. Personal circumstances? Well, did she have a closer relationship with Professor Heyt? Yes. No, I mean- - Do I have to answer that? - You have to tell us what you know. Well, it is possible... that Dr. Burckhardt admired the professor. - I mean, admire, but- - But what? - Professor Heyt never noticed. - How's that? He loved his wife so much, he never looked at another woman. Do you know if Mrs. Heyt asked her husband expressly... to help her die? No. But i?s possible. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. Dr. Burckhardt. Dr. Burckhardt. - Dr. Burckhardt, your first name? - Barbara. - How old are you? - 26. You've worked in Professor Hey?s laboratory for about two years. Yes. - You have a lot of work. - Fortunately, yes. You like working for Professor Heyt? If you mean the workload. Professor Heyt is a genius. We'd often work day and night. He did keep his lecture schedule. Sometimes, things were slower. Do you know if Mrs. Heyt was understanding of his obsession for work? You mean if she suffered. Yes, of course. But that was even more reason for her to love her husband. You thought it was a happy marriage? Ideal, the only happy marriage I know. Can you tell us more about Professor Hey?s character? How is he as a person? I believe only a truly great man can be a truly great researcher. How was your work with Dr. H?fer? He is, of course, highly competent. How do you know? Professor Heyt would only hire especially competent staff. Tha?s right. - I didn't mean it like that. - We know what you mean. One more question. You knew Mrs. Heyt. Do you think it possible Mrs. Heyt expressly asked him to help her die? Yes. Are you aware of any such express request by Mrs. Heyt? I wasn't there, Mr. Prosecutor. Thank you. Witness Berta Link. Please have a seat. Witness Berta Link. Excuse me, Your Honor. I just remembered something. Yes? When I visited my sister the day before her death... she said to me... "Thomas will help me. One way or the other." Your questions triggered my memory. This is very important, Mr. Stretter. Thank you. Ms. Link, please. Three to one for Heyt. Berta Link, age 54. Housekeeper at Professor Hey?s. You know what your statement means for Professor Heyt. Stick to the truth. Don't let feelings make you stray from the truth. You knew Mrs. Heyt from the time she was a child, right? Yes. Tell us. I worked as a cook in a hotel then. Or more like a kitchen maid. That is, I was being trained. - When was that? - 26, no, 27 years ago. Don't start that far back. When did you start working for the Stretters? That was then. It was Mr. Stretter. The old Mr. Stretter. He had some sweet dumplings at the hotel... and asked who'd made them. Later, when he needed a cook, he hired me. - How old was Mrs. Heyt then? - Hanna? She hadn't been born yet. But Eduard was 12. When was Hanna born? About a year later. When did Mrs. Stretter die? She was five or six- Between Hanna's fifth and sixth birthday. - And then you- - Yes. - What? - Pardon? - You wanted to say something. - No. L- - After Mrs. Stretter's death, you- - Yes. Yes, what? Yes, l- I served as a mother to Hanna, so to say. Right. When Hanna left her father to go with Professor Heyt, you- - Yes. - Yes, what? I was- I went- I went along with the child. Because the old Mr. Stretter was absolutely against it. The poor child didn't have anyone. Fine. Now tell us- She was coughing and couldn't breathe. The professor sent me to the kitchen... and Dr. Lang was playing the piano. Then they came down the stairs and they were screaming. Dr. Lang screamed, "You murdered her!" The professor said... "I have done it." Be precise. What did he say? I'll never forget it. The professor said... "Because I loved her more, I did it." More? Well... before that, Dr. Lang had shouted... "Because I loved her, I didn't do it." But this proves that the deceased had asked both doctors for help. Did she? You Herr Strahl, you know her. She loved life. On her last day, she said she'd dance again in two months. Maybe then she'd thought that Professor Heyt had found a cure. Maybe. No, no. She was not a churchgoer, but still pious. She never made such a request. Never did she ask for it! Don't you want to respond? May I ask a question? Where were you when you heard the accused and Dr. Lang? I heard them scream and ran out of the kitchen and was behind the door. First, Bernhard screamed, then the Professor said... "Because I loved her more, tha?s why I did it." And he did it. She was like my own child. She was always so happy. Why did he have to- Calm down. Take a seat. Give her some water. I?s outrageous that witness Dr. Lang cannot be located. - You haven't heard from him? - No. You don't know anything either? No. No one knows. He departed and left a note about his replacement. For the question of assisted suicide, Dr. Lang's statement may be crucial. The witness's conduct is incomprehensible. Please come immediately. Where is she now? Where? In an institution. She's blind. She's deaf too and demented. Wonderful, you healed her, Doctor... instead of letting that poor creature die. Who am I? Am I to decide life and death? The poor child. Doctor, you should have seen her. My child. We always thought you'd come and help her. I'll see her tomorrow. In contrast to my previous view, and in agreement with my colleague... I conclude that there is insufficient proof to determine... whether the deceased died... from the lethal dosage... or from the paralysis of her respiratory system. The sclerosis of the respiratory system... had already progressed so far... that this may have caused... a fatal paralysis of the respiratory system. But tha?s crucial. In a recent case at my clinic, the sclerosis had not progressed this far. As a medical officer, it is your statement... that the death may have been caused by the disease itself? - Yes. I have to affirm that. - My view as well. The accused, then, will be charged with attempted murder instead... under section 211 of the criminal code. He may adjust his defense accordingly. Three years in jail, at least. - I?ll be another moment. - Please excuse my hurry... but a lot depends on it for me. When did you last see the girl? Several months ago. I was on a long trip. She has changed considerably. But I have to see her. It was a very difficult case. An only child, and a young mother. I did everything to save the chil?s life. The mother gave blood for two transfusions. When the child was near the end, I forced the heart with injections. Now, the same mother tells me... she hoped I'd come one more time... to help her child. You know what she meant by "help." I'm about ready to leave our profession. Because of that? Not only that. I also had another case at the time. - You know I treated Hanna Heyt? - Of course. - We're ready, Professor. - Come. Dr. Lang was the girl's doctor. He wants to see her. - Come. - Thank you. CHI LDREN'S WARD Tell me. How can the nurse take that? The nurse? She's a woman and loves anything tha?s helpless. A baby or a sick person, it makes no difference. - Can I use your phone? - Yes. Professor, do you think it possible that the patient asked to die? - Yes. Absolutely. - What facts do you base this on? The life of my colleague's wife... had become an unbearable torture, both physically and spiritually. I witnessed it myself. Add to that the worries about... her beloved husband who she saw suffer for her and her sickness. She was unable to release herself from pain because of her paralysis. Otherwise, she surely would have done it herself. She was an especially strong-willed, lively and smart woman. She would have done it out of her deep love of her husband. - What about the accused? - His motive is found in his love for his wife. He sacrificed his greatest love to help his great beloved. Tha?s what it was. As a doctor, he may have gone outside the law. With your leave, I'm only sharing my personal views. Any legal system that requires a terminal patient... to endure pointless suffering... without the benefit of relief... is unnatural and inhumane. Nature lets things die quickly when life is no longer viable. Medical science with its pills and drugs... insists on artificially delaying the mercy of a quick natural death. Even when a cure or improvement is completely impossible. Tha?s a reversal of what it really means to be doctor. Every doctor is conflicted by that. Tha?s how it is. Do you think the accused acted out of a similar conviction? The great German doctor Paracelsus once said, "Medicine is love." I know Professor Heyt acted out of love alone. Any further questions from the prosecutor? Defense counsel? Thank you. Please take a seat. Defense counsel, do you want to cross-examine Pastor G?rner? The hearing of evidence is thus concluded. I now give the prosecutor the floor. Gentlemen... seeking justice is a difficult and sometimes almost impossible task. If I have the duty to demand the conviction of a man today... whose scientific and individual integrity is untouchable... I'd like to express my thoughts by quoting Richard Wagner... "My weapons weigh on me heavily." My weapons are the existing laws. Based on the trial, they require a conviction for an act... that can be excused on moral grounds. But Professor Hey?s actions can in no way be accepted on legal grounds. Especially not because... as Professor Schl?ter explained... the act is apt to turn the accused into a role model for doctors... who then run the risk of violating laws and their ethical standards. Legally, the following must be said. We cannot apply section 216 of the criminal code. As this requires an express request from the deceased. May I interrupt. Dr. Lang is on his way here to testify. We will adjourn for half an hour. Adjourned for half an hour. Thank God he made up his mind. - What does this mean, Doctor? - I don't know. Anything is possible. What if Dr. Lang testifies that Mrs. Heyt wanted to die? That wouldn't be enough. There must be proof that she stated an express wish to die. - And then? - It would be mercy killing, not murder. Would he be convicted? The expert witness just said that the exact cause cannot be determined. Was it her nerve condition, or did he murder her? If Dr. Lang confirms it, we can go for an acquittal. - There you go. - Unless he's guilty of assault. - What? - That would be a shame. I feel sorry for him too, but he had no right to do that. But it was a good deed, minimizing the poor woman's pain. - You would acquit? - Absolutely. I'm not so sure. This case has created a lot of noise. Some doctors may want to follow his example. That would be a grave sin. If you asked me, gentlemen... Professor Heyt should be acquitted precisely... because he is a role model for all doctors. What if doctors started relieving suffering? Wouldn't people say no? Prefer even terrible pain to dying? - People would condemn doctors. - Come on. Everyone knows what doctors do and continue to do for us. They discovered X-rays and radiation, and became cripples doing it. If someone is terminally ill and would rather die, why should he keep living? If someone asks to die... as the last help who can spare him... doctors should be allowed to help. That is all fine and good. I agree. But can these decisions on life and death be left to doctors? Of course not. They'd take on the responsibility for it. Commissions must be appointed... proper tribunals made up of doctors. But something must be done. It cannot go on like this. It is Go?s will. He sends suffering... so that men will follow his cross... and attain eternal bliss. My dear sir... I would like to believe that God is not that cruel... nor the pastor, by the way. Yes, well, gentlemen... just a few weeks ago I had to give my old hound... the mercy shot. He was blind and lame. But otherwise, he had faithfully served me his entire life. And if a hunter doesn't do that, then he's a harsh fellow... not an honorable huntsman. Yes, but those are animals. Yes, but are people to be treated worse than animals? I?s not that simple. The right to kill shouldn't be given to a doctor alone... these final medical decisions should be left to the state. We would have to pass laws for such "medical courts". But as soon as possible. I'm an old soldier, gentlemen. I?s evident to me that our state demands a duty to die if need be. But then it should also have to give us the right to die, if necessary. Sure, Major, but the laws applicable here are still different. Of course we will judge Professor Heyt under current law. That goes without saying. But allow me to say... the law is not here to prevent people from worthy moral acts. If tha?s the case, the law must be changed. - Witness Dr. Lang is here. - Finally. Come, gentlemen. That was quite an interesting debate on criminal law. We rarely have such interesting lay jurors. I wonder what Dr. Lang will say? I hope he won't make things worse. We're hearing evidence again. Call the witness Dr. Lang. Witness Dr. Lang. I originally didn't plan to appear, Your Honor. - You'll be held in contempt. - By all means. - You are Dr. Bernhard Lang? - Yes. - Age? - 42. - Family physician? - Yes. - Are you related to the accused? - No. You're aware of the meaning of your oath? Yes. You have known Professor Heyt for a long time? - Since we were children. - You are friends? We were. You introduced him to his future wife, right? Yes, for the second time. After the Stretter family moved north... Thomas and I completed our studies in Innsbruck. I opened my practice here. Was your relationship with the Stretters instrumental in this? Yes. - You later supported Dr. Heyt. - Yes. - You treated the deceased? - Yes. How did she assess her condition? She was very patient, sometimes even euphoric... and optimistic, she really loved life. Did that change as a result of her disease? Yes, most certainly. She was afraid sometimes- Was she afraid of death? No, not of death. Rather, of dying. Were these merely moods, or could they be called something else? Was Mrs. Heyt aware of these moods? Yes. She asked me once... if she took a turn for the worse... and if her life would no longer be humane... that I help her die. And you? At that time, I didn't see her request as compatible with my oath. May I ask a question? - Dr. Lang, you said, "at that time." - Yes. That was then. - And today? - This very day? Probably not. Do you think the deceased may have asked her husband too? She did. I know so. Dr. Lang, what do you believe the cause of her death was? May I say something? The expert witness said- Counsel! - Answer my question, please, Doctor. - I don't understand the question. Really? I learned of Hanna Hey?s death from her husband. I have not seen him or the deceased since then. The expert witness must have determined cause of death, right? He said that the sclerosis of the respiratory system may have killed her... before the toxic dose could take effect. Do you think it possible? You are under oath. You said to me, Bernhard, "You murdered her." Yes, Thomas. And today I say to you... you're not a murderer. Thank you, Bernhard. Based on your knowledge of Mrs. Hey?s condition... is her death possible... as a result of either cause stated? An hour before her death, he told me she had two more months. Surely, this cannot have changed since then. You're jeopardizing your acquittal. I know. I cannot remain silent. I?s not just about me. It concerns everyone. I am not afraid. He who would be followed must be able to lead. I no longer feel I stand accused for I suffered the biggest loss by my actions. No, I will accuse now. I will accuse a section of the law... that prevents doctors and judges from serving the public. I don't want my case to be swept under the rug. I want a verdict. No matter what, it will serve as a signal, a change. Therefore, I confess: I ended the suffering... of my terminally ill wife at her own request. My life now depends on your verdict. And the lives of all who may come to share my wife's fate. Now, pass your judgment. THE END
