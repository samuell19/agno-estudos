- In the intense world - of competitive body painting, you can either keep your cool or turn up the heat. - ♪ This ain't no illusion, babe ♪ ♪ Yeah, you're heaven made ♪ - It's a sizzling season three of "Skin Wars." The art of body painting is more powerful than ever. - 12 of the most talented artists - from around the world will push themselves week after week... You painted your heart out. - Proving who is brilliant - with a brush... - Yeah! - Just amazing. - Loved it. - I came here to win. - And who can't handle - the pressure. - I'm freaking out. - Wow. - What? Almost there. - How dare you disgrace this competition with your bull****? - Do you want to leave the competition? This week, eight remain to fight for the grand prize: $100,000 and the ultimate title of "Skin Wars" champion. - Now that I've won my first concept challenge, I'm feeling so strong. I am so excited to keep this run going. - Hello painters. Hi! - You've seen your competitors disappear one by one, and if you aren't careful, your dreams could go up in smoke. - Oh! - Hello, painters. Hi. - Well, hello, everyone, Ru-dini here. - Ru-dini. - Painters, for your first challenge, - you will have - three hours to paint waist-up, front or back, optical illusion on your models. - Yes! - When your paintings - are finished, you'll pose your model in front of a black backdrop. Please use the backdrops set up in the studio while you work to ensure your illusion is successful. - We have a black background, - so with the black paint, - you can actually remove body parts. There's a lot of different ways that you can play with people's eyes, play with their vision to make them believe that what isn't there is or what is there isn't. - This is a very difficult concept to design, so pay attention to your negative space to create the illusion. - Don't be the painter who disappears next. - You'll have three hours to complete this challenge. And your time starts now. - Ooh. - Okay. - I'm, like, really excited about this one. This is way more my speed. My strategy has been to kind of stay under the radar, but today, I'm going in full confidence. Basically this arm is gonna be free floating. We're going android-ish. - Okay. - Esque. I love robotics. I love metal. With robotics, I can, you know, have sparks flying. I can actually rip her arm off, you know, - and have the mechanical - parts all in there and that's my base idea, that's what I want to run with and see what happens. - Who was the bottom last time? - It was me, Jess, and Rick. - Not the funnest ride. - Yeah. - Being on eliminations stage is very scary. It was like tunnel vision. In a way, I felt like I was losing my marbles. I created the marbles coming out from within and then that tunnel vision going inwards. - It's like any artist, - you know? - You make good art, - you make bad art. - Right. - This is my good art. - This is my forte. - Mm-hmm. - I start thinking - about this quilt that my mom has. Why not create a quilt on this girl, like she's sewing herself? Put your hands up for me. - I can blend her - into the background like she's uncomplete. How beautiful is that? - All right you guys, we've only got one hour left. - My piece is prisoner of "Skin Wars." - It's been very - interesting for me to take all these guidelines from the judges. I want to have creative freedom, so definitely struggling. - I'm, like, exactly where I - wanted to be to be at one hour. I'm stoked. - I look over, and Alison's doing the same thing, but she doesn't have any optical illusion. - Luis has got the exact same positioning of his model's hands and the same exact effect of the skin being pulled open, but I know that mine's better overall. - All right, you guys, we have 15 minutes left. We need more time. We need more time! - Time's up! Tools down! Time to see what tricks you have up your sleeves. Michael, tell us about your painting. - So this painting is called Gator Is In Fashion, and I wanted to make a statement about animal abuse in the fashion industry. When she opens her arms, there is an effect of the gators screaming for help. - I remember on one of the earlier challenges you did wolves. - Yeah, and pieces. - Wolves. You've been playing it safe in this challenge. - Well, I feel like I wanted to still show that idea but with a stronger visual. - I decided - to evolve the pattern of my own tattoo. - I want to know about - your color choices here. You've got some trippy colors. - These are very bright colors. I feel like if I would've went with a really - darkish tone, - it would've just been more of a 2-D type of image. - Stay away from that muddy dark you've been warned about. - I used inspiration from a old quilt. I wanted it to be like she was stitching herself together. - Like, it was a metaphor - for life as not all the pieces of the quilt are beautiful. That's what makes the quilt full and whole inside. - My painting is based on the last elimination. I felt like I was at a chopping block, and I felt like I was losing my marbles. - So you're happy - to be here right now? - Oh, definitely. I'm very grateful, and I hope not to let you guys down again. - This right here, I'm calling - it Self Construction. - As you can see, - she's kind of, like, - putting her arm - back together and just building herself all the way out. - Okay, Otto, thank you. - Thank you. - This is the - Green-Eyed Monster-- - Yes it is. - 'Cause, you know, - thinking some of my competitors are a little green-eyed jealous over my win last time. - There's some similarities with Luis's. - Funny that we ended up with a similar thing. - The chance that two people have the exact same pose, I'm not buying it at all. - Do you think yours is better than Luis's? - It's different. I wanted to cover all of her and not leave the flesh tone. - Hans, tell us about your painting. - This piece is a POSW: Prisoner of "Skin Wars." - Wow. - Prisoner of "Skin Wars." This feeling personal? - All wars have a prisoner, and so I figured that would be a good, fun theme to do. - I also like doing - the illusion of a fish tank. - You know, - the fish is stuck in its tank. - I always wondered - what they were thinking inside that little bowl. - It's a very dark piece, so is this a reflection of how you're really feeling, like, deep inside? - You could say that. - Yeah, there's something coming from you that you're not saying. I have a sense that if you let it all out, you're afraid that you might hurt some feelings or something. - Basically, yeah. - This piece is called The Butterfly Effect. - Every competition - that I go into, I always feel butterflies in my stomach, and I'm slowly gaining more respect for myself and my artwork. Each butterfly is escaping, and making me feel better as we go. - How were you able to get that lattice work so precise? - I used my trusty tape today. - Okay, thank you, Brittney. - Thank you, judges. - So what'd you think? - Visually strong works. - Yeah. - I really did appreciate the lattice work that Brittney's had. It tricked my eye. - I wish she would've - used more black. - Absolutely. - Yeah. - I wish she would've not used so much of the skin because when you're using that black background, you can really segment things so that it's not just a lattice work painted on a woman's body. - Right. - Right, right, right. - What about Hans? - Sounds like he's having so much struggle internally, but even though Hans' piece was a bit dark, I really enjoyed the optical illusion part. - Feels like he's right at the tipping point. - He's fighting something. - Yes. - What about Tiffany? - Tiffany's work - with the patch quilt. - Oh. - That quilt. - It had heart, and it was just so beautifully painted. She had the optical illusion where she broke it down into the black, and then the model actually trying to, you know, hold that needle. - I also enjoyed Luis's. I loved that. That was really spooky. - Yeah, it was spooky. - There were textures, things that were playing with my eye. - And that sort of tunnel he created in her chest cavity was beautiful. - Alison's piece was painted beautifully, - it's just there was - no optical illusion. - We wanted that trick. - We wanted to trick our eyes. - We want our - eyes to be tricked, yeah. - She'd win - the eyeball challenge. - Yes. - Yeah. - So have you made a decision? - I think we got it, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - Okay, let's tell them. - Let's go, let's go. - Okay, painters, let's find out who tricked the eyes of the judges the most. Tiffany. - Brittney. Luis. Yes. You are the top three painters. Please step forward. - Once again, - I'm not the winner, - and my feelings get hurt - because they don't understand my piece today, so I'm pretty pissed about it, but... - Great job, painters. You all did wonderful work, but of course, there can be only one winner for this challenge. And the winner of this challenge is... - Okay, painters, - you had three hours to create an optical illusion on your models. - Tiffany, that quilt was exquisite, And I love that you really used the patchwork to share moments from your life, both good and bad. - Thank you. - Brittney, that lattice work was wonderful. It had depth, dimension, and really tricked the eye. - Thank you. - Luis, you took the criticism from the last time and used it. That spiral really tricked the eye. You may have found your marbles. - I just hope - I don't lose them again. - You all did wonderful work, but of course, there can be only one winner for this challenge. - The winner of this - challenge is... Yay. - Luis, you are the winner. - It feels good - to redeem myself. I'm feeling pretty confident. - Okay, painters, as far as your next challenge, if you want to see what the future holds, please meet us over at the elimination stage. See you there. Bye! - Oh, this is interesting. - There's, like, a séance going on or something. There's a crystal ball, - and Rebecca and the judges - are sitting there like they're about to look into the crystal ball for us and read our fortunes. - Hello, painters. Hello. - In your first challenge, - you worked to trick our eyes and bend our minds with your optical illusions. In this concept challenge, you will draw inspiration from another mystical tradition. You will design your own version of a classic tarot card. - I'm not an expert - in the tarot, but if you go to a reader, - certain cards - represent the past, the present, the future, and so where the card is in the placement of your reading will determine what its meaning actually is for you. - Consider your - card's visual aspect - as well as - the meaning behind them. You'll have five hours to create a head-to-toe, 360-degree painting. Let the spirit move you to select your card from the table. - The tarot cards, they're so beautiful. Their art is amazing on them, and I'm super excited. - Brittney. - The Wheel of Fortune. - Oh. - Otto, you're next. - The Sun. - Luis. - The Hermit. - Death. - The Moon. - Hierophant. The what? I have never heard of this thing before. - The Star. - Hans? - The Chariot. - Painters, this is another tough challenge. - I want you to put - a lot of thought and energy into your design. - Y'all, I want to see bold decisions, lots of creativity and energy in your work. Your future depends on it. - Good luck, painters. Bye-bye. Bye. - I'm a little scared because I don't know tarot, and without that confidence, that eats at you, that tears you down, so this challenge is gonna be really hard for me. - How are you today? - We got this. - Are you ready for today? - Yeah. - We're gonna do, like, - a wrecking ball going through you. - Like, a brick wall - and then graffiti on it. I have the Hermit. It means guidance, soul searching, and introspection, so I relate to that a lot because I always have the fear of stepping out of - my comfort zone - like a hermit. The wrecking ball, - that's gonna start - from your hand and the chain's gonna go down, and it's gonna, like, shatter through your chest. - I'm not big into tarot cards, but I figure I'll do a nice little story. The Sun tarot represents fun, - warmth, - positivity, and I'm all about that, so... - the expression on - the sun's face, I want it to have, like, a wicked smile. You know, a mischievous good time. - We're gonna win today. - See, that's the kind of attitude I like to hear. - I have the Death card, and most people think of death as the ending of things, but what we don't realize - is that there's - a new beginning, and that's really what the Death card means. - Bring your arms up. - Yeah. I want to incorporate a regular skeleton over the color red to represent passion and the pain. - On the other half - of the skeleton I want to use bright colors to project life. - I'm excited to see what's gonna - come from this. Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. - The Chariot card has to do with control, determination, and victory. Chariot takes you places. It's also about willpower. - It's like, do you want to do - something or do you not? - Whenever you're in - a position where you're - trying your hardest - and you're doing your best work, and they keep letting you know that you're not really valued, it's, like, I'm not gonna waste any more of your time then. - So at this point, - I have no idea what the judges are looking for, so I don't care anymore. - All right, I need to start - stepping this up. - Looking around the room, everyone's piece is popping and just looks awesome, but I do not get Luis's piece. It doesn't look anything like tarot. - The movement will go like that. - He killed it in - the first challenge, but this could take him down. - We have five hours to do this tarot card front-and-back body painting. I chose the Star, and I noticed on the tarot card, there was a girl, there was water flowing, - there was a bird - about to take off. I want to incorporate them into a design on the body. I'm gonna go literal with the body painting. On the front, I want it to be very symmetrical. I wanted to show the girl with the water wrapping around the body, - and I wanted her - facial expression to be very happy and hopeful because that's what my card is about. - The description behind my tarot card is fear and security and illusion, so I wanted to make the illusion of outer space coming from the inside of my model. - I wanted to pretty much - break her apart with the phases of the moon. - No matter what - destiny you have, it all happens within time. - Wheel of Fortune - actually represents turning points in your life, karma, luck, and destiny. I put it on grandfather clock because that's the route that I want to take it, - is that I'm creating - my own time and my own destiny. At the bottom of my piece there are going to be these angelic figures representing that support system around me from all of my family. - I want to come across - to the judges that I truly understand the card and what it means, and how it factors in my life as well. - Good morning, painters. Well, as you can see, I have Craig and Robin here today. - We're gonna go around - and take a look at your work. - So you pulled - the Hierophant card. - Uh-huh. - Hierophant means religion, conformity, tradition? - Right. - In high school, non-conformity - was like my religion, so that's what my sophomore high school yearbook picture looked like. - Oh, okay. - That's me. - I want to represent my - non-conformity of my youth, and then this radiant mother energy embracing the group. - So you pulled the Sun card. - Oh, I did. I'm just gonna have fun with it. - I'm gonna stay away - from the flames - and the phoenix - and everything else. - Tell us about your sketch. - My daughter's my source - of enlightenment, so I got to put her on there. - Do you miss your daughter? - Oh, I do, and I know that she misses me. - What death does is teach us how to cope with the ending of something and start a new beginning. - You're gonna build - a headpiece for this? - I would like to, yeah. - It's just gonna - be, like, paper I think. - So you need a lot - of time management with something this complicated. - Yeah, well, I'm hoping that - I can make the headpiece, but I don't know if I can. - We're gonna have - a wrecking ball that just kind of, like, open me up, you know? - Are we gonna be able - to look at this piece and understand that it's for the Hermit card? - It's more of an explanation - kind of deal. - I didn't just want - to do something literal. - Hello, Hans. - Hello, judges. - Hi. - How are you? - The Chariot card stands for control, willpower, victory, and celebration. - You're going with - a pretty bold pattern as a focal point on your front. Are you saving the chariot for the back for us? - I have a whole presentation that I think will be understood. - As you know, - I like to tell a story. You'll understand the way everything is designed. - Well, we like surprises. - Awesome. - I'm excited - to show you all later. - Thanks, Hans. - No worries. - All right, - we'll see you all shortly. Thanks, guys. - I put my daughter on the back because one of the ideas represented - by the Sun card - is enlightenment. She is my enlightenment, my hope, my guide, and I do a lot of stuff that I do because of her. - Looking over - at Hans's work here, I think he's more on the simpler side, - and everyone else - has more detailed work. I'm over Hans. - I think a lot of people - in the house are over Hans. - He's always just, like, - talking and talking about how great he is and how well he's doing, but in reality, it's ****. I don't think he has the skills - to stay in this - competition long enough. - It's just been really - hard in this competition. - Art's not usually - about being judged. It's about personal expression, so at this point now, I'm just over it. - How does it look? - It looks cool. - All right, everybody, we got ten minutes left, - Ten minutes left! - All right, ten minutes! - Down to the wire! - Y'all better get your work! Awesome. - Lot of people - are going crazy today. - All right. I am happy with it. - I got you, girl. Look how good she looks. I'm hella proud. - That's it! - Time's up. Tools down, painters. - Whoo. - Now the judges can't wait - to see your final design. Follow me over to the elimination stage, guys. - I look at my piece, and I look back around, and I'm like, "Aw, crap." Don't see a lot of tarot in my piece. - Welcome, painters. - Hello. - Howdy. - Hi. - Let's welcome back our esteemed judges: Craig Tracy. - Hello, painters. - Hello. - Robin Slonina. - Hello. - RuPaul Charles. - Abracadabra. - Poof. - As if by magic, we have the perfect guest judge for this challenge. She's an internationally known magician and one of the judges on SyFy's popular magic competition show, "Wizard Wars." Please welcome magic critic Christen Gerhart. - Hey, painters. - Hey. - I'm a huge fan of art, - and I'm really excited - to see how you guys - take your interpretations of these tarot cards. - I can't wait to see it. - I know it'll be fantastic. - You've had five hours to redesign a classic tarot card. The most fortunate painter will win this challenge and one of you, as fate would have it, will be sent home. Let's see who has the cards stacked in their favor. - The Hierophant represents conformity, tradition, and religion. For the front, I just want to embody religion. There's these rays of light coming out of her. For the back, non-conformity was my religion, and that self portrait, it's just beautifully rendered. - When my model - walks out on stage, it looks way better 'cause the lighting on stage just makes your colors pop. It makes the glitter flakes so crazy. The breaking apart illusion represents how people change when there's a full moon. I definitely feel like I'm gonna be on top. - The Wheel of Fortune has to do with destiny and turning points. It's all an illusion of time, so I centered that around her chest. On the backside, I got a little more spiritual with it, because if you take a better approach in morality, good karma will always lead its way into your life. - I'm proud of the piece I created. - The Hermit, - it's about boundaries, and that wall is a boundary, - and you have to have - that wrecking ball to knock it down. - I feel good about it - as an artist, - but if they - don't understand it, - the whole thing - just falls apart. - The model comes out, and I'm just like, "Damn that's good." The colors are popping, the skeleton looks alive. I made a headpiece with all of these little spermies, and I paint DNA to represent life coming after death. I'm super proud. - I painted a portrait of my daughter on the back of my Sun card. She is a huge influence in what I do and why I do what I do. I have issues with paint cracking. - I don't know - if I'm applying it wrong, but I'll just cross my fingers. I had fun with the piece, but it didn't stack up to what I normally do. - I wanted to represent - every single person that was there for "Skin Wars," so I pick eight stars. There's eight people there. I wanted to show the girl with the water wrapping around the body, - and I wanted the bird - on the back to represent hope and vitality in this card. I'm feeling pretty safe. - I have a pretty good piece. I mixed all these different medias together, bringing fabric and bringing the lashes, the makeup. I've used the gems, applied wardrobe. I don't need to fill every little inch full of detail. I think that's not good. - Wow, painters, great job. Okay, Alison, you're up. - I pulled the Hierophant. It was described as representing religion, conformity, tradition. Growing up as a teenager, my religion was basically non-conformity. - This is sort of - a beautified self portrait of myself as a teenager here being that non-conformist. - The back turns - a little cartoonish, - but I got to tell you, - they way you've done the face with that turquoise and the light in there, it is timeless. - Thank you. - I am in love with the front of your model. When your model came out and you did that beautiful pose with your arms spread and your head back and your eyes closed, I mean talk about regal. - Okay, thank you, Alison. Rick, your turn. - I decided to go - with the name Luna 'cause the name in Spanish sounds a lot more beautiful than just moon. - I'm mesmerized. That back with the cracks and revealing the whole universe within the body like that I think is really poetic. I also love how that hand is coming down as the tarot card reader chooses that card. - I love that you - called it Luna and you didn't refer to it as just the moon. It's a personal touch that was spectacular. The moonlight on the water is beautiful. - Thank you very much. - Okay, Brittney, you're next. - On her chest I have the wheel of fortune itself, and it's placed upon a clock - because I believe - that all good fortune comes in good time. I wanted to go with a very spiritual representation here. - Down towards - the bottom are represented by two guardian angels in my life, my grandfather and my mother, because they've been the most inspirational in my life and pushed me--excuse me. They've pushed me the most to go after my dreams and what I wanted. - Are they still with us? - They are still with us. My grandfather is currently battling cancer, and it's killing me right now, but he--knowing that he's there supporting me... And hoping for the best for me really drives me. - I love this painting. I love how it shows your gratitude for the fortune you've been given, and it's all over this painting. - The best part about this is just truly how much love you put into it. It comes across in your work. - Thank you. - Yes. - Okay, Hans, you're up. - The cool thing - about tarot is always the intrigue of wondering what is on the other side of that card. And this mystic provides a card for you to choose. This here is the card. And so I picked my card, and then it's revealed. The Chariot card. The chariot. - I didn't realize - that the reveal would just sort of be turning her around. - Point taken. - At this point in - the competition, I do think I just want a little bit more, you know? - Something a little bit - more active, - a little - bit more exciting. - It was about control, so it's important for that to be what the focal point is. - The chariot is about movement. - You know, - front and back, I feel like your composition is very static. - I guess, you know, there's so many different ways to interpret tarot. I'm very confused today. My piece is a good piece and it's extremely clean, so the judges are definitely frustrating me right now. - Your interpretation - of the Chariot is very literal, and very telling. - All these gimmicks - and glitz and glamour - and shiny things that - spin in the wind, you know, it's not art. - Your interpretation - of the Chariot is very literal, and very telling. - All these gimmicks - and glitz and glamour - and shiny things that - spin in the wind, you know, it's not art. - It's a little overly simplistic for me. I wanted to see more creative elements. Ultimately, you're responsible for that. - Thank you, Hans. Okay, Michael, your turn. - This is my own modern interpretation of the tarot card Death, and it's all about endings, beginnings, and transformation. For the pedal design and the colors underneath is to project life, and to show the movement of the transformation, and the DNA which are the micro and macro cosmos. - You not only did an incredibly detailed painting, but you also built two headpieces. I can't believe how time-consuming that must have been to achieve. - I feel like you were - just on fire today. You must have been painting like a speed demon. - The headpiece is spectacular. - This is her hair bun, and when I saw it I was like, - "Oh, that's the chin - of a skull," - and I was like, - "That's perfect." - It's magnificent. - Thank you. - I'm missing a focal point - on the back. - Yeah. - I get what you're doing with this DNA sort of motif, but it doesn't have the same power that the front has. - I agree. - Okay, Otto. - All right. The Sun card represents fun, warmth, and my little girl, she's a great source for me. - She's only six, but she teaches - me just as much. - I'm not getting the tarot, but I am getting that your daughter is the sunshine of your life. - Thank you. - So technically, how do you think you did? - Still having troubles. - The face falls apart a little bi. I don't like the wig. - Your cracking issue, - with practice, eventually you're gonna know, like, "Oh, this is gonna crack." - I think I'm just - too much in a hurry. I got to calm down and keep my head in the game as I'm going. - There's not a lot of that tarot aspect of it. - I would've liked - to see a little more - of the card interpretation - of not only your life, - but something else - that you can draw from that. - Okay, Tiffany, you're next. - My body painting was the Star, and basically what I wanted to represent is the tarot card with a more upgraded, fun appeal, - and on the tarot card - there was the woman and she was pouring water out of her vase, - but here I wanted her - to kind of bring life - with the water - wrapping around her. And around the pool, if you go to the back, it comes up and creates this jungle theme right here. - I wish someone would make - me gauntlets like that because those are awesome. - The front of this piece really feels tarot. Love the star and the belly button there. There's just a lot of beautiful power to the front. - Thank you so much. - Luis, you're up. - The Hermit, it's all about soul searching and guidance, so I use art to guide my entire life. - The brick wall - is kind of my skin. There's this wall which is pretty much the barrier that I put up, - so the wrecking ball, - it's, like, I'm not afraid anymore to just knock out a word once I understand it. - I feel like the head-to-toe brick is a little bit oppressive. - I also just don't feel the Hermit. I just wish there was a bit more of the actual tarot. - Okay, thank you, Luis. - Thanks, guys. - Painters, please return to the painters' lounge and we'll call you back shortly. So who were your favorites? - I really enjoyed Michael's. I thought he really depicted the Death card beautifully because he also included the rebirth and the regeneration, which is so important for that card. - It spoke of the card without question. - Another one of my favorites was Rick. I think he just did a fantastic job tonight. - I loved that piece. I thought it was a wonderful interpretation. I felt like it really embodied what this competition particular was about. - Putting that glitter as the reflection on the water, that was a stroke of genius. - Well, what'd you guys - think about Alison? - It was just exquisite. And the face, she looked like Nina Simone. She looked like an African princess. - Otto had the best intentions with this piece. There were parts of it that were so charming and beautiful, but I think he kind of missed the mark completely as far as execution of the challenge. - He painted a carnival picture. - It's sort of cheapened the idea - and the mystique of a tarot card. - Here we are, - halfway through the competition, and his paint is still cracking. - Luis's work was very difficult for me to follow. - That '80s vibe thing just wasn't doing it. - I just felt that - he didn't really understand the depth of the Hermit card. - At this level - in the competition, it is not good enough. Hans is not trying hard enough for me, and this was a safe painting. Even the wheels on the chariot, which are suppose to take him to the next phase of his life, were sort of an afterthought. - They looked stuck and stopped, - and that's how I feel - like he is right now. - I feel the same way. I'm uninterested in what he's doing, and that's the worst place you want to be in a competition like this. - Okay, so have you made a decision? - The cards have spoken. - Welcome back, painters. You did unbelievable work. The judges had to conjure up all their wisdom - and they've made - their decisions. Tiffany. Brittney. Congratulations, you're safe. - Thank you. - Please head back - to the lounge. - Good luck, guys. - Michael. Alison. Rick. Congratulations, you're the top three painters. Michael and Rick. You are the top two painters. Alison, you're safe. - Thank you. - You may head - back to the lounge. - Thank you. - Michael... - You're the winner. - Congratulations. - Yeah! - You not only depicted Death beautifully, but also life, which is the true meaning of that tarot card. - You and Rick may go back to the lounge. - Thank you so much. Yeah, that's right. I'm feeling so good and smooth. - Congratulations. - So cool to win. - Hans, I have a question for you. - Shoot. - Do you really want to be here? - It's been a little - rough for me lately, - finding my inspiration - and passion and making beautiful art, but I'll tell you, I haven't really had a chance to do that, and it's been very uncomfortable. - This competition, - we recognize, is not comfortable. - Yeah, it makes you not want to do it anymore, you know? - If that's the case, then why be here? - Maybe you're right, Ru. - Maybe I don't - want to be in the competition. - You have to realize - that in L.A., I'm the guy who goes and makes the model more pretty on the runway. - Hans, we feed off of your energy, and we need you to want to be here. - It has been hard for me. - Do you want to leave the competition? - If I don't have a place where I can make my best work in a passionate place, I would say that-- - This is a lot of words again. I want you to answer the question. Do you want to stay or do you want to go? - Well, you know, - everything in this competition has been a new question and a new riddle within each day, so this right here is a riddle like the rest. - How dare you disgrace this competition with your bull? If you don't want to be here, then get out. - Hans, do you want to leave the competition? - Sure. - Well, we hear you loud and clear. This is not the place for you. - Thank you, Hans. Good luck. - I'm not into, like, - these fickle little stupid games about who's better or who should win. I don't play that game. - Okay, am I safe or am I not safe? - Otto and Luis, as if tonight hasn't been difficult enough, you are in the bottom two and one of you will be going home tonight. - Otto, you had the best intentions, but you just didn't depict much of your tarot card, and technically, that cracking was distracting. Luis, there was too much brick, and it felt sort of outdated. It just didn't really relate to the tarot. - The judges had a very hard decision to make. Otto... It's time for you to go home. - No problem. - Luis, you're safe for now. You can go back to the painters' lounge. - Thank you, guys. My confidence is destroyed, but I'm safe, and I get another day to paint. - I told you - you weren't going home. - But I wasn't expecting Hans - to just throw in the towel - like that. - What? - Wow. - Otto's gone as well. - No. How the hell did they choose your piece over his piece today? - If you have a problem - with that, talk to the judges. - I'm just utterly shocked that they picked Luis's piece over Otto's piece. It wasn't beautiful in the way like a tarot card should be. - You are a gentle giant, a sweet, sensitive man with a lot of talent. Your daughter is a lucky, lucky little girl. - Otto, please go wash off your canvas. - Thank you. This whole opportunity, this whole experience was outstanding. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Just to be able to meet all these different artists, just to be able to... to play. - My dude. - All right, bud. - It was a fun ride. - Always. This battle was fun. I had a blast. Bye, Otto. See you later. I'm not gonna cry about it. I'm not gonna get mad about it. Just being able to make it to "Skin Wars" is one of the highlights of my life. - Next time on "Skin Wars"... - We're sending you - on a little field trip. - Whoa! - We're gonna get into - the tank. I've never done that before. - It's like an adrenaline rush. - Is anyone freaking out? - Yes! - You got so much foam on that girl. - Yeah. - Luis has no idea - what he's doing. - Do you now what that is? - It's a lobster, right? - No! - This piece reminded me of a third grade play. - It's a -up mess. - You need to check your ego. It could send you home.
