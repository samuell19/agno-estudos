(dramatic music) (wings flapping) - I ask you for the last time, Colonel, what is the strength of your force in this area? And what is your specific mission? - Leonard Harris, tanker, serial number A2786241. (blows thudding) (Leonard grunting) - Tie him up. You signed your own death warrant, Colonel. - Hey, what do you think you're doing? Parrish, do something. - And you? - Damn it, start something. We gotta get outta here. (wood clattering) (bird chirping) (wood crashing) (dramatic music) (blows thudding) (men yelling) - Get him outta here. (blows thudding) (soldiers yelling) (gun firing) (gun firing) (soldiers yelling) (explosion booming) (gun firing) (gun firing) (soldiers yelling) (guns firing) - Come on, get up. - No, wait, you can't leave me. - Goodbye, Colonel.

They take from each other. The villagers go hungry. - Tell 'em not to worry. I'll take care of it. (Maila speaking in foreign language) (man speaking in foreign language) (villagers yelling) - Okay? (telephone ringing) - Hello? Oh, Sam. The Congressional Committee's on my back. They want answers. POWs and MIAs, specific answers. - [Sam] Actual numbers, that sort of thing? - [General] Yeah, well, the old man will be asked about reports of GIs staying behind with the guerillas.

I'm getting sick and tired about these damn reports. And for the press, I'd better change the story. Sure, I wanna send someone out there. We'll do the best we can. Okay. - Something new? - Yep. And good for a change. Someone's volunteered to go there. (gentle music) - I want you to track down Yank Crazy. He's giving us a lot of trouble. You take distant side of Nata. And you take the northern side. The superstitious villagers may be hiding him there. - All alone, sir? - You can take some soldiers with you. All that matters to me is to get that son of a bitch. - It'll be done, sir. - The yank will die. (Minh speaking in foreign language) (tense suspenseful music) - Now this is a special surprise. It's a M60 machine gun. Fires 600 rounds a minute. Fully automatic. Can be carried by one man. Yep. I'm gonna teach you how to use it.

He's here. - Good. Send him in. - Bring him in. (dramatic music) Sit down, Major. Anxious to get it started, Thompson? - I guess so, sir. - How come you volunteered? - Unfinished business, sir. (gun firing) I have a non-com I wanna take with me, sir. - Okay. How well do you know the Montagnards? - Some. I separated from my unit once, and we spent several days around a Montagnard area. - Can you establish contact with them? - Yes. (gun firing) - Now, you've got to get in there and out quickly. You'll be dropped off at the border area, where your contact has been arranged. Good luck, Thompson. (helicopter whirring) - Operation. Operation, this is recon. Come in, come in. (suspenseful music) - What's your message, over. - The two Americans are here. - Send them right away. Out. (helicopter whirring) Good luck. What is your particular interest in Yank Crazy? He's your comrade, isn't he? - I have no particular interest. Look, Colonel, we've already been through this once. What is this, an interrogation? - Of course not. Remember, we are allies now. She's my daughter. - What's she doing in this Godforsaken jungle? - She's a nurse. I recommend her for an appointment, so she's under my command. I'm very concerned about her safety. She's my only child. Come, let's get down to business. (glasses clinking) (blows thudding) Hey. - Yank Crazy? - We'll find out. (suspenseful music) Stay out of sight. Yank Crazy? (knife clinking) Yank Crazy? (dramatic music) (guns firing) (blow thudding) (suspenseful music) - Wait. Go in pairs. You go that way. You, this way. We'll meet here, 1400 hours.

Bad luck. You think of home? - No. I live here now with you and our son. (birds chirping) (villager speaking in foreign language) (blows thudding) (man speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (men yelling) - Yank Crazy? - We don't know about any Yank Crazy. - Do not speak unless you are asked. - But these, they is all my peoples. I have for them to speak. - Enough. One more word and I'll blow your head off. (men yelling) (guns firing) (suspenseful music) (man groaning) Where is Yank Crazy? More. - Stop. I will tell. - Yank Crazy? - You come. - Let's go. (dramatic music) (Maila crying) - Maila, what happened? - Him go. Oh, Steve. (gentle music) (man whispering) The sword. The sword.

Please, now, get the baby. (dogs barking) (dramatic upbeat music) Maila, take the baby and go to the shelter. - Come with me. Please come. Come on. - Okay. You know your positions. Let's go.

Besides, I had you to carry. - We're gonna go back in and make sure. - For Christ's sakes, let's just wrap this up, forget about that Yank Crazy, and get the hell outta here. - Why didn't you make sure that bastard was dead? We'll get the information to Colonel Minh before our nervous politicians. Head to the Pentagon, and a promotion. - Shit. (suspenseful music) (upbeat music) (fire crackling) - [Steve] Thank you for saving my life. - [Maila] Thank you? - [Steve] Maila's beautiful. - [Maila] Beautiful? - [Steve] Beautiful. Beautiful. The rainbow's good luck. - [Maila] No, is bad luck. - [Steve] There's gold at the end of the rainbow. - [Maila] No, Yang Gray, he lives up there. Bad spirit. Bad luck.

Put these on. Put 'em on. Here. These, too. We've got a long ways to travel. Go on. Shoes, too. You've got a trap to set. Come on. - Hey!

Wait, I'm coming down. (gentle music) (crickets chirping) (baby crying) Damn animals. You're nothing but a pack of animals! Thompson, you traitor! Animals! - These are the documents you need. I hope this will please the politicians in the Pentagon. Major. - My father wants you to report to him immediately. Don't you obey orders? - Yes, madam.
