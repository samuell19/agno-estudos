Joe. Hey. You in? Joe. - What? What? - Are you all right? - Yeah, I think I just might have had too much coffee. I'll be right back. - You're where? All right, then I will see you soon. - What's going on? They're Here. Here you go. - Thanks. Do you need more coffee? - No, I'm good. - Are you okay? Are you worried about that test? - Test? - Doesn't Woodrow have a test tomorrow? - Oh, yeah, I just... I'm fine. See, I'm smiling. Hey. Hey, there's our fearless neighbors. Scotty. - What'd we miss? Did you bring it? - Yeah, yeah, yes. - Should be good too. HD, Zoom, whatever, LED. - Yeah, and if my Dad finds out you took it, you're dead. - Well, we're all gonna die tonight anyway. - Well, that's encouraging. Joe, what about you? You ready to die tonight? - I could only be so lucky to die in such company. - Yeah, might. How exactly did we get talked into this? - I have no idea. - Come on. How often are women allowed to partake in scientific... - Oh, screw yourself, okay. I could think of about a hundred better things to be doing tonight. - Hostile. - Babe, I thought we agreed to this. Right? We're gonna sell the footage to ghosts shows. - Ah, actually I think that her and I agreed to a double date. Now, I know that you two think that a night of Mario Kart is romantic, but you've really outdone yourselves this time. - Speaking of romance, did you... What is this? This is all you brought? - Do you need more? - This is three teaspoons. Of course we need more. Wait, what do we need more for? - We just need more. - Well, is Grim still open? - Barely. - Let's do it. Right, I mean we need more powder. - I think this may do. - Yeah. - Hey, Judy. Good evening, Chief. - Evening. Well, I smelled the popcorn poppin' and there it is, so... Let me get you a bag. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. You aren't going to be using motor oil for butter this year are ya? - Chief. You better come in and see this. What do we got? - Put it on your desk. Fax just came in. Why would they send it to you? - Did you tell anybody about this? Call the mayor. Ah, this thing works great. - What is this? I don't know, let me check that. Oh yeah. - I feel dirty. All right, baby powder, where are you? Yeah. - This one. Humidifier. Oh, do you think Rachel will wear these? Yes. - You seem a little more distraught than usual tonight. Need a bump up? - No, I'm good. I just... I just started getting college stuff. - Yeah, me too. Scary stuff. How are you and Corey doin'? - Fine. - Ah, here they come. - Girls miss us? - Did you find everything you need? - Yeah, sorry, we had a little trouble. - Thank you. - And here we go. - That's a big file. - Yeah, I always hoped I wouldn't have to open this one again. Che Gunther. - We're gonna be up all night. We have carnival workers who are taking their sweet ass time. - Any progress? - Didn't you hear? We're protecting at least 6,000 people this weekend. At least 6,000. Something wrong? - Yeah, Che Gunther escaped. Just got this fax. - Thought he was dead. - Yeah, well, his transport bus careened off the road, the guards are dead, Gunther escaped. - Where was the bus? Rockford. - What do you think? - I don't know. Do you think he could come back here? - Well, he may be here already. - What about the festival tomorrow? - We can't have a panic on our hands. - Yeah, well, we may have something worth panicking about. - We need to keep this man in the past. Rob, what have you got up there? - This Che Gunther? - Yeah, that's him. I remember. All those kids, right? - Yeah, six. Five boys and a girl. Okay, so this is our trip to Munger Road. Say hi to the girls in the back. All right, clearly they are jazzed. Corey, you wanna introduce yourself to our audience at home? - Corey LaFayve. - La asshole. Rachel, this is for TV. - Yeah, take two. Corey LaFayve. Gotcha bud. - Um, you wanna say hi back there, Joe? Okay. - Okay, if anybody finds this tape, I would just like it to be known on record that we are being held here against our will. - Yeah, how did you get out of those handcuffs by the way? Don't tell that. All right, okay, so where are we goin'? - We are, right now, on a road that's been haunted for years. Yeah, everybody has a story about Munger Road. Yeah, do you know which one's true? What is it? - The train tracks. Yes, that's the one I know of. Apparently a bus full of kids was hit by a train and they haunt the track. What? You don't believe it? Look it up on your phone. Do it. - That's not what I heard. I heard that a little girl was murdered out here. Something about, like a farm by the train tracks. - Farm, smarm, train tracks, whatever. It's haunted. - I think that farm story's bullshit, because there's no farm out there. There's no... Yeah, I've never seen a farm out here. I'm sure it's bullshit. - Whoa, wait a second. Did you two just agree on something? - Oh, we may have. No! - My God, it's unethical. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. I think we're coming up on it. - Wait, is this it right here? I don't know. Oh joy. Yes, it is. Great. Okay, hold on. Zoom in real quick. Get this for documentary purposes. Yeah, there we go. All right, here we go! Okay, we got it, dude. Let's do this. You guys ready? Ghost shows, baby. - I just feel uneasy. - Yeah. - If he is around here, I know where to find him. - Where? - Let's go. He wasn't known as Che Gunther around here. We all knew him as Father Che. Swanson, we're switching over to ten. - He was a priest? Roger that. You know where I'll be. - Dude, we should probably save that battery. - Roger. - You can barely see anything out here. - Well, that's kind of why they call it in the middle of nowhere. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Pull over here. Baby powder. - Do you girls wanna come help us? We're putting it on the entire bumper. - Might think we'll stay in here. Hold down the fort. - Yeah. - Lame. - Are these idiots for real? - I don't know what's scarier. My boyfriend pouring baby powder all over his bumper, or the fact he's filming it. - What time is it? It is 11:14, and I have a message from my Mom. Where are you? She even believe me? - Are they done changing the baby yet? Ah. - Jesus Christ. - You're so not funny. - The train tracks await. Are you sure they'll be there? - You know, Father Che was here a long time before I came to St. Charles. - Well, that was a long time ago. Yeah, well, he married Charlotte and I. Hold it. - Should we go get the shotgun? - No, you don't bring out a shotgun into church. Is it loaded? - Yeah. There's no lights. Oh, I think there's a switch over there. Oh yeah. I'm seriously creeped out. - What? - I said I'm seriously creeped out right now. - Why are you whispering? - People whisper when they're scared. - You're scared? - You got a problem with that? - No, I think the office is over here. Hey wait! Right over there. What? - I heard something by the pew. Oh Jesus! - No. Chief. You're looking for the lights. - Father. You're up late. - Still an early night for me yet. - Haven't seen anything unusual tonight? - No, just a couple of cops scaring the jeepers out of me. - So, you gonna be making those candy apples this year? - Mixing the caramel as we speak. - Well, have a good night then. We'll... God bless you. - God bless. Bless you. Christ. Nice one. - Whoa! Listen, tell your story, all right. - Okay, all right. So, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna put baby powder on the bumper for physical proof that paranormal activity exists right here on Munger Road. - You're not gonna see any ghosts, guys. - That is what the baby powder is for. Okay, check it out. We're gonna pull up on the train tracks, stop. - Oh, this sounds brilliant. - It gets better. We're gonna put the car in neutral... And, come on. - Okay, and we wait. And turn it off. - Yeah, we gotta turn it off, and then we're gonna wait. Okay? The kids don't want us to get hit by the train like they were. Right, they're gonna push us off the tracks. Yep, they are helpful ghosts. - That's right. A sixth sense, and this is totally legit, because people from school have done it. Wait, this is seriously the story? What, you don't believe it? Okay, okay. I'll tell you what. If anything from that story actually happens, I will ride home with my top off. And, you can video tape it. - That's like a bonus, bro. - That's kind of like the most awesome thing ever. Yeah. Ah, what about you back there? Yeah, yeah. - What about me? I'm gonna leave that part to Rachel. What? - This is it. Guys, guys, guys, this is it. Okay, slow and steady. Okay. All right, right here. Okay, now what? Okay, turn the car off. Neutral. Lights. Dome light. Come on. All right. This is so stupid. You're stupid. That's mature. You're a juicer. Nice. Are you girls okay back there? Is that a serious question? Shhh. Rachel, shhh. Ah, how long are we gonna sit here? Honey. Don't honey me, we're sitting on train tracks. Okay, but there's not a train, there's no cars. Okay, everybody. Shut up. Can we please get out... Holy shit. Are you getting this? Oh my God. Holy shot, holy shit, the car is moving. This is unbelievable. This is so fake. I swear to God I'm not doing a single thing. The car's doing it completely on its own. All right, you got your footage. Gravity pushed us off the train tracks. Start the car. Well, hold on. Are you still rolling? Uh-huh. Okay, we gotta go check out the baby powder. You're right. Holy shit, dude. Get over here. What? What the... Look at those. Where's the button? Hold on. Oh my God. Dude, this is amazing. - This is actually gonna work. We're gonna be on TV. - Yeah, let's get the girls out here. Morons, the car is in the middle of the street. Okay, shut up and just look at this. - What? - It's true. The story's true and you have to take off your shirt. Joe. - What? Joe, come out here, look at this. - I don't give a shit if there's a hundred hand prints on the friggin' bumper. It's after midnight. - Okay, Miss negative, just look at this. - This is incredible. Did you guys get this on camera? Uh-huh. - Yeah, everything documented. TV. - They're gonna be blown away. There's no way a human being could have actually done this. - I know. - Are you guys for real? Rachel, it's a set up. Who's hand prints do you think those are? God, you guys drag us out here in the middle of nowhere, the camera, it's all bullshit. - No, we didn't... - Corey, please. - Did you set us up? - No. - Do you set us up? - No. - Unbelievable. - Okay, well, they have a point. - She's not gonna take her shirt off, is she? - I wouldn't close the book on that yet. I can work on that. Seriously. - All right. - Yeah, all right. Yeah, we'll keep a look out there. Thanks for your head up, Sergeant. Take care. What was that? - That's the state police. There was a car jacking just off the interstate. - You think there's a connection? Everybody's home, Glen. Can't make 'em safer than they already are. - Yeah, but you just don't understand, Hendricks. - Understand what? - We can not wake up tomorrow morning with more kids missing. - What else do you wanna do? We can't wake up the entire town and scare 'em half to death. - The owner of the vehicle was found dead. What kind of car? - It's a late model Ford van, it's white. What do you wanna do? - Find it. I can't believe you two. What are you, nine? - Okay, babe, we didn't set anything up. - It's fine, you've had your fun, start the car, let's just go home. - Joe, do we have to leave? We're having some fun. Romantic. My God, Corey. - Okay guys, okay let's just... - Okay, okay fine. We'll go home. - It won't start? - No, I'm doing this for... - Corey, stop fooling around. - I'm not pulling around. Come on. For real? Piece of shit. Woo. Close. Oh, this is great, romantic. Come back tomorrow. You know that really was an original story. Wait, didn't you forget the twisted metal hook in the mirror? - Oh ho, har har. - The story's true. - You actually believe all those stories? - Okay, the story is that this place is creepy as shit. End of story. - Where are you going? - Well, the fastest way back to the cafe is the way we came, so... - Are you scared to go back, Joe? - Joe doesn't get scared. So ya threaten her with fun. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - Nothing. Just, you know, we were trying to have some fun, and you were kind of acting like a bitch. - You're calling me a bitch? - No. You're calling me a bitch. - No, that's not what I said. I didn't say that at all. - You're such an asshole. I didn't say that. I didn't call you a... - Guys! Jesus. - I said you're acting like a bitch, I didn't call you a bitch. - You know, what a waste. I'm sorry I haven't played your cute little damsel all night long. - Okay, and what's that supposed to mean? - Okay, guys, enough. We're going home. - Corey, just say you're sorry. - For what? - No, it's fine. He doesn't have to say anything. - Joe... I wasn't trying to call you a bitch. I'm sorry. - Corey, what the hell? - Ah... - What's going on? - The gas pedal isn't working. - Corey, come on. Enough pranks. Seriously. - I'm not pranking right now. I think the car just died. - Well then turn the car back on. - Everything is on, Rachel. My foot is on the gas pedal. Shit! This is just great. - Right back where we started. - We might have a slight problem. Take all night, both sides of the river. - Maybe we should split up. Chief. - What do you think? - Ray. Where are you? - I'm lookin' at ya. What's up? - Mrs. Harley's been trying to reach the office. - What, did her pilot light blow out again? - No. She said she saw somebody at the empty house across her street. Went through the side door. - Across the street? 112 North. - Yeah. I don't know shit about cars. - It helps if you can see. Rach, try it again. Okay. - Shit, it's not even trying to turn over. - Mom's gonna kill me. Do we have enough money for a tow? - I think it's the ignition coil. Probably cocked it going over the tracks or something. - So the car's not gonna start? Nope. Rach, call your Dad. We're gonna need a ride. Can we even get a tow right now? - I don't know. - Guys, I can't get a signal. - Shit, neither can I. - Neither can I. - Shit. What's special about 112 North? It's where he used to live. Isn't it a block down? - Let's walk. I don't wanna show the car. - So? So? What took you so long? For what? Catch him. - I wasn't the chief then. Took 'em three days to find that first boy. They found him in the river. We didn't know what to think. - Gunther drown him? - No, that was it, the murder weapon. What? - Well, we couldn't figure out what it was. First we thought it was some sort of animal. There were tooth marks all up and down that little boy. - Jesus. He bit 'im? - This is it. Put the light out. Look at this place. This garage is bigger than my house. - It's a carriage house. Be re having it for years. It's been jimmied. Yeah. - Put it out. Right, listen, I want you to wait out here. Check the back and the front, case him when he comes out. Think that's a good idea? - What, are you scared? - Yeah, are you? - Turn off your radio. Keep sharp. - Now what do we do? Any ideas? - Well, I think we should just stick it out in the car and wait for someone else to come down the road. - Okay, but it's been over an hour and there hasn't been a single other car. - Okay, well, I think it's too dangerous to go hike in the woods, so... - Yeah, but dude, six hours 'till daylight. - What would be the fastest way back to town? - Walking. Probably down the tracks. - No, no. Absolutely not. I'm not walking or going anywhere. - Babe, the car is sitting in the middle of the road. So what do you want us to do? - You could take your shirt off. - Oh, you are such an ass. You know, this is your fault. - My fault? Yeah. - Last time I checked that your boyfriend was in on this too. You're not gonna blame all this shit on me. - Okay, look, nobody's blaming anybody, dude. So just chill. - I'm blaming both of you. - Oh, and what good is that gonna do? We're still stuck. - Guys, guys. Did you hear that? - What? Mouth one and mouth two? - Everybody shut up. What? - I think I heard something on the pavement behind us. - Well, get the light. - Listen. - What is that? - Something's happening. - Rachel, stop. - Shut up. What do you see? - This is not happening. - Shut up. - I don't think it matters at the moment. I think it knows that we're here. - Well, I think we should get the hell out of here. - Yeah, what are we gonna do? Run? What? - Chief. Shit. What the hell is that? Must be haunted. Hendricks! Freeze! Hendricks! Hendricks! - Okay guys, I think it might be gone. I'm gonna look. - No. - If this is another part of your prank, if I get out of this car and the Steiner brothers, or anybody else pops up, just tell me this is another part of your joke. - Joe, where you goin'? - I got a text message earlier from my Mom, while you're spreading powder on the bumper. - No, Joe, you can't go out there. - Yeah, that was like two miles back. Are you kidding? - It's better than waiting till morning, and the next invisible hand to beat down the car. All right, either way we need to get home. - Joe, Joe, Joe. Joe. Joe. Joe. Joe, Joe. - What? - We were just tryin' to have a little fun. - And the back window? - I swear it was just the bumper. - Look, Corey, I'm tired. I don't feel good. I just wanna go home, all right? I wanna get home. - Sorry. It's my fault that we're out here. I'll go, and you can stay here with these guys. - You'll come right back? - Yeah. - I'll time you. Can I see this? Ooh, that's a... That's a nice little knot he gave ya. - What about him? - Man, I shot the poor bastard in both legs. Well, I'll let you process him. He's out of surgery. - I never used my gun. My dream is a little better. - Next time. - Who is he? - Oh he's just some guy out of Dicalb. Look at that. Copper? - Yeah. Simple thief. - Of all the nights. - Tell me about it. Does the radio work at least? - Um... No. - These freaking crickets are creeping me out. - Crickets are important though. Did you guys know that you can tell the temperature outside from them? - Yeah, we were in the same third grade class. - How does it work? - Yeah, Rach. How does it work? - Who gives a shit? - You're just mad because you have no idea. - Come on, let's hear it. It'll be at least slightly amusing. - You can tell what temperature it is outside by adding the number 40 to the amount of chirps you hear in 14 seconds. - That's brilliant. So what's next? - I wonder if you can tell what time it is? - What? - Wait, there's no way that's the time. What time is it? - Shit. It says 11:14. - How could the clocks just stop? - So I just talked to Chief Harvey. He's on his way. He's been looking for your copper thief. - Now what? - Been no sign of that van. - What reason would he have to come back? - Well, it's his town, his home. Where else is he gonna go? Look, there's a hundred places he could be hiding. There's gonna be 6,000 tourists here in a few hours, and we just can't sit on our hands. - No, but we don't wanna run around in circles either. - Kirkhoven. Hey Ronnie. What? Where was the last place he was headed? Okay, all right now. I'll start there. I wouldn't worry, I'm sure he's close by. Just... I'll check it out and then call you back. All right? Don't worry. That was Ronnie Claussen. Scott didn't come home tonight. - Chief, what's going on? Are your radios off? - Ooh shit. Fuck. - Samantha's been trying to reach you. Joe's missing. - Joe's missing? Yeah. - So is Scott Claussen. What? - His Dad said he was at the cafe. - Well, they're probably just out parked somewhere doing whatever it is kids do. - Yeah, I know, I hope you're right. - Do you have to do that? - I'm not going outside. Where the hell is Corey? He's taking way too long. I don't know. Maybe he had to go a little farther. - It's been like two hours. Or it's still 11:14. God, I should have gone with him. - You know, I think it's just our luck that we take the one car that doesn't have a CD player. Guys wanna watch? Here we go. Middle of nowhere. - I think we'll stay in here. You know, I don't know what's scarier. My boyfriend putting baby powder all over his bumper, or the fact that he's filming it. What time is it? It is 11:14. And I have a message from my Mom. Must be 11:14 for a while now. Won't start? No, I'm doing this for... Corey, stop playing around. I'm not playing around. Come on. - Holy shit. - It's my phone. - Phones are working? - Corey sent a message. What's the message? - What is it? - It's a picture. A picture of what? - Of us. - What the hell? Does this mean the phones are working? - Corey. Corey! Yo. - He must have been right here. He just sent it. - I know, I think we should get back in the car though. - Stupid phone. - I know, my phone isn't working either, but get back in the car. - Look, he was right here. Look. - Joe, I don't think it's safe that we're out here. - Corey! - Joe! What? What is your problem? - The camera. - Screw the camera. - No, listen to me. I think someone else is out here. What are you talking about? Guys. Guys, guys. What? Corey sent you a message. What? What did he say? Run. That's got Claussen's car. - Hello. Anybody home? - Hello. - Oh, hi Chief. - Hey Nance. See your Dad's got you working graveyard, huh. - Yeah. It's not too bad. It's quiet. Hey Ross. - Hey. - You guys want some coffee? - No, no thank you. - Scott Claussen, he isn't here is he? - No, they all left a while ago. - Who they? - Scott and Rachel. They were here with Joe and Corey. - Corey LaFayve. Mm-hmm. - So, when did they go? - A few hours ago. I still have their receipt. - Did they say where they were goin'? Did they say anything at all? - No, I don't think so. - So, that was Scott's car out on the street. - Yeah, they all left together. Is something wrong? - No, no no. It's just curfew. K, we'll you see you, Nance. Take care. - Chief. They had a video camera with them. - Video camera. Right, well, thanks Nance. Say hi to your Dad. - Will do. - Video camera. - What does that mean? - Corey LaFayve. - What? - His grandfather was the one that arrested Gunther. - So we got a guy on the loose again, a kid's missing, somebody broke into his house all in the same night. - Yeah Ray? You better come over here. - There was a van in the way. A van. - So what do you got? - Well, we finally got the carnival set up. - We've got to get the trucks across the river, and there's a van in the way. - What van? Oh God. Guys, wait here. Hendricks. Yeah, run the registration on this. - Is it blood or anything? - I don't know. Engine's cold. - Why would he park it here? - Well there must be a reason. - How are we getting messages? - There's something weird going on here. No shit. - Maybe we should get out of here. - What about Corey? - Where is he? He's been gone for like three hours. - I don't know. I've got a really bad feeling. I mean, he might be an asshole, but he wouldn't do something like this. - So what do you wanna do? - I don't know what good it is just sitting around here. - You wanna what? Go walk in the woods? - Corey went that way. Train tracks lead right to town. - You're insane. We're gonna stay in this car with the door locked. - Okay, Corey says run. That's good enough for me. You two do whatever you want. - Joe, you can't be serious. - Screw the phones. It's probably what Corey did. He probably just headed towards town. - You know what? I'll go. - No, you won't. - Babe, out of anyone... - No, no, Scott. We are not going anywhere. - What time is it? Shit phone. - Rach, I'll go, all right? I'll be back before the sun comes up, tow truck and all. - I'm sure you'll be fine if you just follow the tracks. - All right, well, what do I tell the tow truck company? What road are we on? - Ran the plates. Van's registered to an Alyssa Segwin. Nobody's picking up the phone though. - Yeah, well, the van's pretty clean. There's no sign of a struggle. Nothing out of the ordinary. - What are you thinkin'? - This just doesn't feel right. - Well, Rachel Donahue's mom's been calling me 15 minutes. - You know, it's three o'clock in the morning. Something is wrong. All of this is adding up to something. The van parked in the middle of the city, and the kids missing. He's hiding somewhere. Somewhere close. - Chief. He could be anywhere. - That's it. Let's go. - You think he checked into the hotel? There's no way he's here. You've been up way past your bedtime. Oh, great. Another scary basement. You think this is scary? Yeah. - What? It's a network of tunnels under the city. Tunnels for what? - Well, bootleggin', and then before that, the underground railroad. - Can't even see her anymore. - Shit, I'm out of smokes. Probably should have told her to pick some up. - Should have went with her. Gunther knew about this place. Goes right under the church. - If he's down here, he picked a damn good place to hide. I'd let him stay. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Do you hear that? Yeah. - Yeah, that's the river. That's the dam there. This runs right under the river. The church is this way. You said he was eatin' the kids? What? You said there were bite marks or something? Oh, that's what we thought at first. Well, what was it then? Well, Gunther was a sharecropper. You know, he gave some of his farm land to Jimmy Pratt and a few other farmers there. Pratt, like the Pratt wood's forest preserve? The one off Munger Road? Yeah. Yeah, that was Gunther's property. There's an elevator right by the train tracks over there, and, you know it, wasn't teeth marks from a person, or an animal. It was a corn sheller. Like a husker? Yeah. Yeah, I got a picture of it in the office. - Well, maybe we should go back up and take a look at it. You know, know what I'm dealing with here. - What, are you scared? - Naw. If I ever marry Nancy, I'll have the reception down here. Yeah, good. And this goes up to the church. Oh wow, look at this, this is great. They don't make stuff like this anymore. Now let's head back. - Chief. I don't think this is where the tunnel ends. - And there's no blankets. And there goes the battery. Can't even hear the crickets. Must be as cold as it feels. It's okay, your body makes the best warmth anyway. Your hands are freezing. Sorry. Rachel. What? What the hell? We need to get out of here. Okay. Listen to me. On the count of three. Unlock your door. We're gonna run. Okay. One... Two... Three! Oh shit. Where's that light? Rachel. Damn it, Rachel, where... Babe. What the? Rachel. Rachel. Babe. Babe. Rachel! No. No, babe. - Corey, where are you? Corey. What the hell? What the hell? My God. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. Corey. Corey. Oh my God. It's real. I thought it woulda gone this long. Where are we? I think we're headed northeast. Canada's northeast. Wouldn't that be something? So how did LaFayve catch Gunther? After the five boys were found dead, the little girl went missing, and they looked for days. What happened? Well, you know of that farm out by Munger Road, the farmhouse that Jimmy Pratt use to use for farming? They had a house there with a basement, and that's where Gunther used to take 'em. That's where they caught him. Never found the little girl. I know this story. The little girl. The one that haunts Munger Road. Yeah, do you believe in ghosts? No. Kids take their cameras and whatnot up there. Scare the girls. - That's why they brought a video camera. - Holy shit. The farm. - The tunnel leads there. Must be. - All right, listen. Go back to the car. Get out there as quickly as you can. - What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna take the tunnel. Ray, Ray come in. Ray. - Maybe I should take the tunnel. It'll be faster. No offence. You know it's true, Chief. - All right, go on. All right, I'll see you on the other side. I'll see you there. - Swanson. Swanson. It's Munger Road. Gunther has the kids in a farm off of Munger. I'm on my way there now. - My God. Shit. Shit. What the hell? Corey. Corey. Corey. Corey. Hello. Oh my God. Help me. Help! Somebody help me. - Corey! Anybody! It's me. - Corey. My God. What is going on? - Are you okay? - I'm just... Where did you come from? - I ran into a slight problem. Where the hell are we? - I don't know, but someone outside is really pissed. - But I heard you. Your scream. Where have you been? - Trapped. I don't hear anything. - I don't wanna move. - We gotta go. We can't. - We have to go. On the count of three. Count of three. - Please, please, please, don't go, let's just stay. - One... Two... Three. - No, no. Corey! Oh no! - Please. Help me! Help! - Oh yeah. Oh God. Oh God. Oh shit. Oh shit. Help! Help! Help Me! No. No. No! No! Oh please. - Joe? Jesus. It's okay, it's okay, honey. You're all right, you're all right. You're gonna be fine. It's all right. Hey boss. - Holy shit. - You all right. - Yeah, I'm fine. What's goin' on? - Is it gone? Is it gone? - Yeah, honey. He's gone. We need help. - All right. We're gonna have to scour the whole woods. Listen, we're looking for three kids. Two boys and a girl, all right. Let's get that organized. - You found Joe. She's alive. - She's the only one. We searched the place. - What the hell happened to her? - She was in the basement, and he was here. - She must be hysterical. - Yeah, well... We found Corey's car about a half a mile down the road there. - What were they doing here? - I have no idea. We're gonna have to get the whole story. - Well, I don't know what happened to Scott and Rachel, but she says that Corey was killed in this barn. Now we haven't been able to find anything, but that's what she says. - Did you call the parents? - Yeah, they're on the way. - All right, well, we've got a big fucking problem. We got at least 6,000 people coming this weekend. - Right, listen to me. The tunnel that is underground at St. Charles, it runs all the way to the basement of this house. - All those years. - Listen. Ross found something. - Somebody, actually. - Who? - Might have been the little girl. - We'll find your friends, Joe. - What are we gonna do, Glen? This maniac is still on the loose. - Start with the woods. We've done it before. Duke, I found this. Does it play? It's a video camera. Kirkhoven here. Yeah, hi John. What? You have absolute identification on her? When did... And he... Thanks, thanks a lot. - What is it, Chief? - That was the state police department. Said that Che Gunther's body was found on I-90 earlier this morning. He was hit by a tractor trailer. - Well, I guess that's a relief. - Yeah, I don't think so. He's been dead since yesterday. Trucker called it in at quarter after 11. Joe. What exactly did you see? ♫ Bring me ♫ To the window ♫ So I can see where your days go ♫ Tears from his eyes ♫ Down his face roll ♫ Ripping his chest ♫ Sing a mouthful ♫ Bring me back into the darkness ♫ The rancid half stench ♫ Of a piss drenched mattress ♫ Holding me here ♫ Reeking of hopeless ♫ Closing his eyes ♫ The only way out of here ♫ Not that I care ♫ I could have been here a long time ago ♫ Not that I care ♫ Now that I'm rotting away in the end zone ♫ Not that I care ♫ I could've sat down and taken control ♫ Not that I care ♫ I should have slowed down ♫ And walked my own road ♫ Own ♫
