[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [YOUNG BRIDGET] "Once upon a time, there was a very special fish. This fish was an ancient magical fish who brought happiness to many that she met. Some say that fish was guided by angels. One day, Fish was swimming along the water's edge, when she saw a young girl who was crying. The young girl's family needed money badly, so she agreed to marry an old wealthy merchant in the town, who she did not love. Fish felt deeply for her and started to glow. The young girl noticed this glow light and started to follow Fish. She followed Fish along the water's edge until they came up to a beautiful castle. Fish started to glow once again. A young man walking along water's edge noticed Fish. He was amazed by the fish, and then noticed the young girl. He was taken by her beauty and she thought he was very handsome as well. They spent the whole afternoon together. As he walked her home, they fell in love and he asked her to marry him. She agreed to marry him, even if he was a peasant with no money. He confessed that he was a prince and soon, they were wed by the water's edge. They both knew that Fish had brought them together and wanted to include her in the celebration. They lived happily ever after and Fish stayed for a while, but she knew she had more to do. So, she swam off for her next adventure."

Hey, hey, keep it down. There's no need to shout. I-I didn't shout. What'd you say? I said I didn't shout. - Trout? - Shout. I said I didn't shout. What do you call that? Good point. So, what can I do for you? Yeah, I'd like to buy a ticket, please. - Where to? - California. California, eh? Yes, please. That's a long way from here. - I know. - Snow? No, they don't have any snow there this time of year. What? Are you traveling alone? Yes? You know, you look kinda young to be traveling alone and I can't sell a ticket to an unaccompanied minor. I'm eighteen. Hm. You got ID? Uh, I-I-I did, but I-I think I lost it. Huh. You know, we only go to one place in California. Anywhere is fine. [SIGHS] Two hundred and twenty bucks, please. Okay. Well... Now, that's a nice picture. Is that your family? I don't have a family. Sure you do. Everyone has a family. Not me. Not anymore. Um... So, what time does the bus leave? Not for a few hours. Don't come around too often. This isn't your regular Greyhound bus station. Well, hopefully one will be here by tonight. It's 8 a.m. You have a long book? [SIGHS] Thanks. [INDISTINCT] One at a time, now. - I'll go first then. - Stop. - We have a winner. - Winner of what? You just won a seat next to me. [FRANKIE] You coming, Emma? I wish we didn't have to go. You'd rather stay here? Well... I'd rather be anywhere else than here. At least, most days. But I hate the woods. Why? You scared or something? [LUTHER] Come on, Frankie. We're gonna get the worst seat on the bus if we don't hurry up. Don't be a fraidy cat, and come on, you can sit with us if you want. - But, Frankie. - Oh, hush, Luther. You know, you're just as scared sometimes as she is. Am not. You are so. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [KATHLEEN] It's like herding cats. Everyone in? Good. Let's go. [MUSIC CONTINUES] - Come on, you guys. - Hurry up. I'm coming. No pushing. Alright, guys. Come on. Let's get going. Go and have a good time. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Sweet Jesus. [LAUGHTER] Alright, guys. Alright. Now, listen up. We all want you to have as much fun as you can while we're here, but first, a few rules, okay? Johnny. Crazy eyes up here, please. [KATHLEEN] Rule number one. You all should've divided into groups of four. Teens, you're in groups of two. George. [KATHLEEN] Everyone have their group? [ALL] Yes. Okay, good. We need you to stay with your group at all times. If you get separated from your group, find me, or Miss Melissa, or Mr. Leonard, or any adult in a brightly-colored shirt, okay? [ALL] Yes. Okay, good. Rule number two. Don't go beyond the flags on the outside of the camp site. [KATHLEEN] This is a great place with a lot of fun activities, but we are also in the wilderness and there are a lot of fast, big, sharp-toothed animals and we don't want any of you becoming bear food. [ALL] Ew. Ew is right. Rule number three. Don't litter. Rule number four. Have fun. [ALL] Yay! Alright, alright, now, okay. Mr. Leonard is going to show us to our cabins. - Yep, come on. - Oh. Alright, we're walking, we're walking, we're walking. Okay, cabin's just over here. Why do we have to bunk with the little kids? [MELISSA] Compared to me, you're all little kids. You'll be fine. Hey, little kid. And up, up, up, up, up. Okay, crazy campers. This, drum roll please, is your cool cabin. Make yourselves at home. Don't fight over the bunks, guys, okay? [FRANKIE] Come on, Emma. I got top. Luther, honey, do you need to use the bathroom or are you just super excited? Bathroom. Ooh, uh, boys' bathrooms are outside and to the left. Girls are on the right. George, will you please go with Luther? Thank you. Okay, so, dinner bell rings at 6:00 and we all meet in the cafeteria, and tonight, for dinner, we are having hamburgers, fries and chocolate sundaes. Yum! [ALL] Yay! See you all there. Oh, uh... One more thing, uh, feel free to explore, but do not go beyond the orange flags that outline this camp. Beyond that is private property and we don't want you all to be trespassers. Did you guys hear that? - Yes. - Yeah. Miss Melissa, can we go and play now? Yes, honey. You all go have fun. [MELISSA] Please stay with your groups and remember, check in at the cafeteria when you hear the whistle. Are you all too good for fun? - Mm. - Yeah, yeah, thought so. No. Too bad, let's go. It's camp. - Woo! - Woo! Ready or not, here I come. MacKenzie and Laura are behind that tree over there. Johnny, come on! I wonder where this trail goes. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [OWL HOOTING] This must be the flags they were talking about. I don't see any bears or animals beyond them. But Miss Melissa and Miss Kathleen said... They said to go have fun and be adventurous. But we can get in trouble. [FRANKIE] Do you see anyone else around? Who's gonna tell? You? George? - No, I won't. - No. Emma? I don't think we should. Come on, we're always stuck in that home. We deserve a little adventure. Don't be so scared all the time. [GEORGE] Look, there's a house over there. Looks abandoned. Maybe there's treasure in there. [GEORGE] You think? Well, if you had treasure, where would you bury it? [LUTHER] On a sunken ship. [GEORGE] A deserted island, of course. [FRANKIE] Or maybe a deserted cabin. Hmm. Maybe. How do you know it's deserted? [FRANKIE] Because the windows are dirty. No one would live in a house like that and not keep the windows clean. Haven't you seen any movies? Houses with dirty windows are always deserted. Maybe the owners only visit sometimes and they haven't been here in a while. Whatever happened, I'm gonna go check it out for treasure. Who's with me? Fine, I'll go by myself. But if I find treasure, it's all mine, you babies. [FRANKIE] Finders keepers, losers weepers. Frankie, wait, we're not supposed to go anywhere by ourselves. Well, then what are you waiting for? We can't just let her go by herself. What if there is treasure hidden in there? [GEORGE] Or a wild animal. I don't wanna be their next meal. Emma, what do you think? - Emma? - Huh? [LUTHER] What do you think? Well, Miss Melissa did say to stay in groups. [EMMA] So... Alright, fine, I'm the oldest here, so I guess I'm in charge. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [GEORGE] It looks like there's a door over there. Maybe it's unlocked. And how're we gonna reach that, brainiac? None of us are tall enough to even touch the bottom of the cabin. Maybe someone can stand on someone else's shoulders. It's not gonna work. We're still too short. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [GEORGE] Hey, look, there's a ladder. Maybe one of us can climb up the ladder and then the rest can secure it. [FRANKIE] I don't know, it looks dangerous. Who's gonna take a chance on that? I'll do it. Really? You? Yeah. Okay. Frankie and Luther, keep the ladder from moving. Aye, aye, captain. [COUGHS] - You okay in there? - Yeah. Alright, we're gonna go to the front. Hello? [KNOCK ON DOOR] [FRANKIE] Took you long enough. [LUTHER] Are there any animals living in there? I don't think so. Sure is dusty. Watch out for a creaky floor. People always hide things under the floor in movies. It looks like whoever lived here had a baby. Jackpot. - What is it? - Is it a treasure chest? That's not a treasure chest. That's for toys. And what do you think toys are to a kid? Hm? Let's open it. [GROANS] Oh, man, they're just baby toys. So much for treasure. Well, how did I know? Busted exploration. [YELLING] Jeez, Jake, not cool. Okay, Miss Melissa and Miss Kathleen would be so angry that you guys left the camp site. Well, so did you. Well I'm big and you're little. Besides, I came looking for you guys. What are you babies doing in here anyway? We're not babies, we were looking for treasure, but there isn't any. Well, duh. This is just someone's old house. [KYRA] There's nothing in here but dust and... Dust. [BELL RINGING] That's the dinner bell. We gotta go. [JAKE] Come on, if I get in trouble, you guys get in trouble. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [BUZZING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [BUZZING] Emma, you coming? Come on. What're you doing? Promise not to tell? Okay. Pinky promise. Look. Where did you get that? It was in the toy trunk. You stole it? It's always the quiet ones. I think it's magic. Magic doesn't happen for kids like us, Emma. If it did, do you think we'd be living in a group home without families? You don't believe in magic? I've never seen anything magical happen before. I hope all the time for magic, but, do you? I think anything is possible and I swear I saw this fish glow. Nope, no magic. But hey, we can use it for story circle if you want. Just don't tell anybody where you got it. Where'd you get this? Uh, Emma found it underneath the bunk. - Wasn't that in the... - Shh! Well, wasn't that in the toy box? I don't know what you're talking about. And we're gonna be late for story circle. Emma, did you steal this from the house? I didn't steal it. Just... borrowed. She says it's magic and it glows. You're not gonna tell on me, are you? No, I'm not gonna tell on you. We'd all get in trouble. We all crossed the flags. Looks like we're all in this together. Deal? Deal. Deal. Luther. Deal. It'll be our secret. [MELISSA] It's story circle time. Let's go. Emma, I don't think you're crazy. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Hi. - Hi. - Mind if I sit with you? Oh, no. It's my dinner time. That bus should be along any minute now. Sustenance. Health. And fun. That's what I always say. You gotta have fun in life, you know? Hey, you hungry? No, no, I'm okay. No, no, no, here. Thank you. Think nothing of it. So, is that your name? Anthony? Mm-hmm. Patron saint of all that's lost. Things. People. - People? - Yeah. How can you lose people? There's a few ways, I guess. None of them are very pleasant. But, you know, I don't think you can misplace a person, can ya'? I mean, I've never misplaced anyone, have you? - No. - That's very good. Saint Anthony, the patron saint who helps people find what they've lost. - I'm named after him. - Hm. [ANTHONY] The only thing I can do to really help anybody is to try to get them on the bus that is going somewhere we send it. [CHUCKLING] Speaking of which, where is that bus? If it ever comes. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [ANTHONY] Strange weather we're having. [KATHLEEN] Remember, me and Miss Melissa will be going around and listening to all your stories and the best, most exciting story... that group gets to go into the lake first and they get first dibs on ice cream sundaes. [ALL] Yes! Yeah! So let the story-telling begin. Nah, uh, uh, uh, Kyra. Give me the iPod. But this is a kid's game. Well, if you wanna be like the adults you can go clean the bathrooms. Otherwise, you're gonna stay here, participate and use your imagination. Thank you. Okay, I'll start. No, I wanna start. I think Emma should start since it's her fish we're using. Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm the oldest. And who cares if she has some dirty old fish? 'Cause whoever has the fish gets to continue the story. It's only fair. Emma can start and then pass the fish to whoever she wants. And then, that person can pass it to whoever they want and on and on and on. Just do it. I don't wanna be here all night. Fine. [EMMA] Okay. Once upon a time, there was a girl. Well, why does it have to be a girl? Duh, 'cause girls rule. Girls are dumb. I know you did not just say that. Alright, let's just get on with it already. Emma, hold the fish. [SIGHS] Well... I could make it about a boy. But I just have this very strong feeling like it has to be about a girl. [BUZZING] You see? Never mind. [SIGHS] Okay, here we go again. Once upon a time, on a foggy night, there was a girl, lost in the wilderness. [DOOR RATTLING] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Hey, hey, hey. Look what the wind blew in. I didn't even hear it arrive. That's Philomena. Hello to the lovely Phil. Lovely to see you again. Well, good to see you too, Sir Anthony. Heard you got a new passenger for me. Yeah, got one for you tonight. Well, it's good to meet you. My name is Philomena, but you can call me Phil. I'm Bridget. See, how this works, honey. The bus moves, not the depot. You're in good hands here. Good luck to ya', Miss Bridget. - Thanks for the sandwich. - Anytime. - Run along. - Hm. Now see that she gets to where she's going. - Have I ever let you down? - Never. And be sure to say hi to our friend for me, would you? - Will do. - Okay. Wow, that was fast. [JAKE] Boring. What a snooze fest. Let me get the fish. Hello, Frankie. Ha! My turn. Sit down and don't be such a bully. Is everything alright over there? - Jake? - Yes, Miss Kathleen. Can I please continue the story? Now, as she goes along wandering through nowhere... a man appears behind her. [LUTHER] Is it a scary man? [FRANKIE] No. [GEORGE] Is he old? [FRANKIE] No. Uh, you looking at me? No, no, no. If you will please stop interrupting me, I could tell you what kind of man. A little man appears beside her and introduces himself. [FRANKIE] Hi, I'm Jude. Where did you come from? Here. But-but I thought I was the only one. Oh, I was asleep in the back. You probably missed me. It happens a lot. Hey, Phil. Hiya, Jude. Looking good. Good to be back. It's been a while. That it has. Happy to see you. So, where you headed, Bridget? How do you know my name? Oh, I heard you say it earlier. But you said you were sleeping. - Mints? - No. - No? - No, thank you. Gum? No. Let me see. Licorice? Hm, let me see. Oh. Some turkey gravy? No, thank you. I'm not hungry. Ooh, wait a minute. That's from, uh, Thanksgiving. Forget that. Not hungry? Hold on. How about a ukulele? [LUTHER] A ukulele? Frankie! [FRANKIE] Quiet, Luther. That came out of your pocket? I don't play, but... it's always good to have it on board in case somebody does. I don't play either. Hm. So, I guess we'll just have to talk then. Where are you from? Well, I don't really think I'm from anywhere. I do a lot of moving around. Been in a lot of houses. Too many to count. With your family? No, um, I don't have a family. Everybody has a family. - Not me. - Why do you say that? Oh, you know what? We don't need to talk about it right now. Oh, wait a minute. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I think I got one more thing in my pocket. Oh. Fish stuffy? I'm tired of this story. Let me get the fish. Ugh! [TIRES SCREECHING] What was that? Uh-oh. - Hey! - Hey! - Not cool, Jake. - Yeah, whatever. What's all the fuss going on here? Jake threw the fish Emma found in the house beyond the flags into the woods. Luther! Oops. Sorry. Emma, is this true? Right, and I bet you had a few accomplices, didn't you? Right, Jake, Kyra, go to the cafeteria. See if they need help cleaning or peeling potatoes. - What did I do? - Do as I say, Kyra. Now, for the four of you, story time is over. I want you to immediately go back to your cabin and remain there for the rest of the evening. - But... - No buts, George. Can we take the marshmallows with us? No, you may not, Luther. Now head to your cabin. I'll be there in a few moments to have a talk with you. Thanks a lot, Frankie. Me? Emma took the fish. Well, she wouldn't have the fish if we didn't go to that cabin. [FRANKIE] Whose side are you on anyway, Luther? We're related, remember? [PHIL SIGHS] Pop! What now? Jude? What? Don't look at me. Do I look like I can change a tire? - What about you? - No. Tsk, well, then... guess we have to call in some backup. Backup? Aren't we in the middle of nowhere? No, no, no, we passed Nowhere an hour ago. - We're on our way to... - Which means we could call. - Do you think he's up? - Yeah. Yeah. Do it. Somebody call for a cab? Hey, dude. Is that in your way? Oh, no, it's okay. Kinda like a pillow. Sorta reminds me of a... Of what? - Nothing. - You sure? Seems like you were thinking of something pretty good. Um... Well, it... it kinda reminds me of a stuffed animal I had when I was little. It was a fish too. I used to take it with me everywhere. It was my favorite. Oh, yeah? Yeah, um... My mom and I made it together when I was real little. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [MOM] You and your fish are both smiling. It's so sweet. Look at your little "Cheese". Good. You get that from your dad. What happened to it? Um, I lost them. It, I mean, um, actually, I lost... I lost it. Oh, that's too bad. See, now that's a job for Saint Anthony. He'd help you find that fish. That he could. You'd think he would've helped me find my waist. [TIRES SCREECHING] Or find the road. Hey, let's not get crazy now. Okay? What about a family? [ANTHONY] Miracles happen every day, my dear. [KATHLEEN] I think someone walked off with the fish. - Oh, boy. - Some one needs to find it. Well, we'll have Miss Melissa send the kids out for it. Hold my feet. Boo. Oh, come on. It's not that bad. We can't get into that much trouble. Frankie, I'm getting tired of holding your feet. Jeez, Luther. I'm just sad, I guess. Why? Because of the fish? We can go find it tomorrow. Hopefully a bear doesn't eat it. Luther, bears don't eat stuffed animals. Well, my little mischief-makers. What do you have to say for yourself? Nothing? We have rules put in place to keep you safe. Keep you out of harm's way. You can't just go breaking them because you feel like it. Can you imagine if adults did that? Imagine the calamity. What's calamity? It's... it's trouble. It's potentially harmful trouble and I don't want anything bad to happen to any of you. What about Johnny? No, not even Johnny. Now... you broke the rules and apparently you took something that didn't belong to you. So, tomorrow, when everyone's swimming and having fun, you'll be looking for this fish and you're gonna bring it back to me. - Not the cabin? - No, to me. I can take it back to the cabin before we leave. Or I can give it to Mr. Leonard. He might know who owns the cabin and maybe he can explain. But I don't think anyone lives there anymore. It doesn't matter. If it doesn't belong to you, then it doesn't belong with you. Now, I want everyone to go wash their face, brush their teeth and get ready for bed. You too, Emma. Okay, campers. On your mark. Get set. Go! [ALL CHEERING] Don't touch. Don't touch. Don't touch. Okay... who farted? Alright, my four, are you ready to go on your scavenger hunt? Why don't Jake and Kyra have to come? Jake's the one who threw the fish. Don't you worry about them. You just worry about finding it and bringing it back here if you can. Here, Emma. If you get lost or hurt, I want you to blow that for help. You're in charge now, okay? Okay. I will. Alright, you've got one hour before you're back here to check in, fish or no fish. Understood? Okay, off you go. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [RACCOONS CHITTERING] Johnny, please leave the raccoons alone. [PHIL] You know, I feel like a little song. ♪ There ♪ Was a farmer who had a dog ♪ And bingo was his name-o ♪ B-I-N-G-O ♪ And Bingo was his name-o ♪ There... Apple? Oh, thank you. Juice? ♪ ...was his name-o... Yeah, thanks. ♪ ...N-G-O ♪ B-I-N-G-O ♪ And Bingo was his name-o ♪ I think I see something. You say that every five minutes. Yeah, and I think that last "something" was deer poo. No, really. Look, there it is. Great. Now let's go back. Wait, what are we going back to? We can't go swimming. I don't wanna just sit there and watch other kids have fun. But Miss Melissa said... Let's hear her out. What did you have in mind, Emma? We could have our own story circle right here. I mean, why not? It was fun last night. [LUTHER] Before Jake ruined it. And we can finish the story. But Miss Melissa's expecting us back any time now. Do you think she'll notice if we're gone a little longer, when she has all those kids to look after? I'm in. - Me too. - Oh, alright. But does it all have to take place in a car? Okay, how about Pineville? So, anybody hungry? Starving. I can go for a juicy burger and some pipin' hot fries. Or a barbecue sandwich and an extra big bowl of mac and cheese. And what about Miss Bridget? Well, I could go for... an extra cheesy pizza. I know just the place. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [BRIDGET] Where are we? Why, Pineville diner, of course. Don't know how you missed all those signs. Hey guys, welcome back. Hi, Anthony. Hope you brought your appetites. Follow me. She knows him? Oh, yeah. He's very popular. Guess so. Thank you. On the house. Ah! Thanks a million, dear Ann. Don't mention it. This is the best chocolate milkshake I've ever had. I'm so very glad to hear that. But don't fill up on it too fast because we still have got more food coming. Now, let me see. You're gonna have the barbecue sandwich with the big bowl of mac and cheese. Yep. For you... large cheesy pizza. And for you, Miss Phil, burger and fries. - You got it. - And what about Anthony? And Anthony will have an empty plate so he can take a little from each one of you. I'll be back. Guess you have been here before. Yeah, but not too often though. I mean, if I came here as much as I wanted to, I wouldn't even be able to fit through that door. And that's how you know Ann? Hey, my main man, Anthony. I thought I heard you come in. Hey, Andy, how you doing? Why, little Andy, you're practically an adult. No, just taller than last time you saw me. Still a little kid, though. At least, that's what my sister says. - Hey, you remember Jude? - Oh, yeah. You had hair last time I saw you. Good to see you. And this is Bridget. - Bridget, hello. - Hi. [FRANKIE] Let's make him a prince. [LUTHER] When is it gonna be my turn, Frankie? It's my turn. Did you have to yell and alert the whole town? Why do you have to have the prince thing? That's so stupid, Frankie. That just goes to show that you know nothing about makin' up stories. Haven't you ever read any fairy tales? There's always a prince. Yeah, and I do kinda like the prince. Can't we just keep him? Fine, but can you just make it a normal guy? What... just happened? [LUTHER] Order up. Luther, bears don't talk. In my imagination they do. [GIGGLING] Fine. Hey guys, I gotta get back to work. It's good seeing you again. Bridget, it's nice to meet you. You too. Ah, that Andy. Such a good kid. - And his sister. - You know his sister? - Yeah, Ann. - Really? Yeah, I met Ann and Andy at the bus depot, like you. But years ago. Burger and fries. Barbecue sandwich and a big bowl of mac and cheese. One large empty plate. And a cheesy pizza. Wow. [ANN] Anything else I can get for you? Maybe some napkins. - Got those. - Thanks. Oh, maybe some ketchup, some mustard. - Hot sauce? - Yeah, got those too. Alright, enjoy. [BRIDGET] This is the cheesiest pizza I've ever seen. [CHUCKLES] [CLEARS THROAT] Oh. - Yeah, just put it on top. - Mm-hm. I'm gonna need a nap after all of this. Hm-hm. Yeah, that sounds good. Don't worry, we'll get you to where you need to go. I mean, you're not in a big hurry, right? Not really. And there's nobody expecting you there, right? - No. - Well, it's settled then. We'll have a nice little nap and then we'll hit the road. [JUDE] Alright. So, Bridget, you never really told us your story. What do you mean? Well, you had said that you weren't really from anywhere, but everyone is from somewhere. I mean... all I know is that I was gonna be in foster care until I turned 18, and... then I could go wherever I wanted. So, um... the minute I turned 18, I was out of there. Wait, so you're saying... your birthday was yesterday and you didn't even tell us. Um, actually, it's today. What? You mean I sold a ticket to an unaccompanied minor yesterday? What difference does it make now? She's 18 today. She's an adult. Well, that's easy for you to say, I could get my wings clipped. Hey, Bridget, you know, birthdays are a big deal. Not really. I mean, not to me. Of course, they are. Haven't you ever had a birthday with streamers and balloons? And a cake. [LUTHER] All this food talk is making me hungry. [CHILD] What was it? What was that? [MAN #1] What was that? [SHUSHING] Sorry. Did you hear that? This calls for a celebration. - Ann! - Yeah. Do you have any birthday cakes on the menu? Of course, we do. Hey, Andy. - Yo. - One birthday cake, please. I'm on it. Alligator, Fox, Bear. Go get the big birthday box from the back and help me set this place up. We're having a party. Uh, what is happening? Magic. You'll see. - Can-can I go to the bathroom? - I hope you can. - You know what I mean. - Of course. Go on. So, guys, what do you think? We only have one more day. I sure hope she finds it in time. Don't worry. She will. I've got a track record to keep. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [ALL] Happy birthday, Bridget! [PARTY WHISTLE BLOWING] All of this for me? [PHIL] Of course! Well, not all of it. I mean, you gotta share the cake. Speaking of which... ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday, dear Bridget ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ [CHEERING] Thank you. Make a wish! - Make three wishes. - Three? Why not? There are three tiers. That's basically three cakes. Alright, but make 'em quick. Okay, um... Finally. Cake time. Birthday girl. Thank you so much. This seat taken? - It is now. - Huh. Have a seat. Oh... I forgot how great Andy is at baking cakes. I still can't believe all of this is happening. What's happening? I mean, this. A-all of this. I mean, I can't even remember the last time I celebrated my birthday, let alone, having someone to celebrate it with. Well, like I said, birthdays are a big deal. It's about celebrating you, your birthday and all the wonderful achievements you've had through life. Yeah, well, my... my life hasn't always been so wonderful. Well, maybe so, but that's what makes birthdays great. It marks a new beginning. A new hope for what's to come. Maybe your life hasn't been so great so far, but you have a lot of wonderful opportunities to come. You just have to wait and see. Trust me. What makes you so sure that this year will be different? I have my ways. May we join you? - Of course. - Oh, yeah. [SIGHS] Of course, I don't know how I'm gonna eat all of this cake. I am still full from lunch. Don't be daft, there's always room for cake. Who are you calling daft? Well if the shoe fits. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. [JUDE CHUCKLING] That'll teach you. [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] How do you like them apples? Food fight! [LAUGHING] [MELISSA] Emma, Frankie, George, Luther! - What time is it? - Let me check my watch, George. What difference does it make? Let's go. Wait, maybe we can tell her we didn't find it and wanna keep looking. It's your head. [SNORING] Hey, what hap... You know what? Never mind. They're out cold. Food coma. Yeah. You know, I think I'm gonna go for a walk, but if they wake up, could you tell them for me? Yeah, sure. Just be careful. You know, there's wild animals out there. Okay, um... It was nice to meet you, Andy. Bridget. - Okay, bye. - Bye. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [BUZZING] What in the... Wow. Looks just like a fish. - Hello. - Hi, um... Are you here with the camp. Uh, no, I, I was just, uh... You saw it. Is it yours? - Well... - No, she found it. We're here to retrieve it and then bring it back where it belongs. I-I take it it's not yours. No. You, you saw it... didn't you? Yeah, kid, I did. Saw what? Oh, well, the fish. It, uh... It what? Nothing. Well... thank you very much. Sure. Do I know you? Oh, I don't think so. Does she, Emma? I'm not sure. I don't think so. Are you sure you're not with the camp? Um, no, I was just having lunch with friends at the diner and decided to go for a walk. Okay, well, at any rate, thank you for locating it for us. - No problem. - We better head out. Come on, Emma. Emma. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Hello? [SUSPENSE MUSIC] Hello? [STEPS CREAKING] [MUSIC CONTINUES] - Dad. - Hey, kid. - Dad, look what I made. - All by herself. - You made this? - Mm-hm. What did you name her? - Fish. - That is the perfect name. Let me go get my camera. - I think he liked it. - He does like it. It's very cute. Just like you. You did a good job. - Hold the fish up. - Alright. - Yeah, just turn her like this. - Go ahead and fix your hair. [MOM] You look super cute, okay. I want a big smile, baby. [MOM] You and your fish are both smiling. It's so sweet. Look at your little "Cheese." You get that from your dad. [DAD YAWNS] You okay? Yeah. Mom, we forgot Fish at the cabin. - I want Fish. - Don't worry, sweetie. Fish will be waiting for you in the toy box at the cabin when we go back in a couple of weeks. And I promise, when you see Fish again, it'll be magical. She's my favorite. I wanted to show all my friends what I made. [MOM] I know. Hey, how about some chocolate? Before dinner? I won't tell if you won't. - Did you grab the snacks? - Yeah, they're in the bag. - They're not here. - By the purple blanket. What purple blanket? All I see is the green water bottle. It's... the purple blanket... - By the extra socks. - These socks? Yeah, the chocolate chips, under the... - Found 'em. - High five. [HONKING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [GLASS SHATTERING] Oh, it's just you. You okay? Um, yeah. [SIGHS] I just had a bad memory. Do you need to talk about it? No. Okay. Nice house. Yeah. Doesn't look like anyone lives here. Or if they did, they haven't been here in a long time. Apparently. It's kinda cozy though. If you like that dusty kind of feeling. Yeah, this place is a mess. Yeah, well... it's like they left and didn't come back. For a real long time, anyway. Well, um, it's not like we're staying here. So, uh, where are Phil and Anthony? Oh, they stayed back at the, uh, diner to help Andy and Ann close up. [YAWNS] Sorry. Somebody's tired. - Yeah, I guess so. - That's okay. You've had a long day, haven't you? Yeah. A good one, though. Good. You know, if you're too tired, you can always stay the night and get back on the road tomorrow. But where would we stay? Why not here? How you doing, dear? - Can't sleep? - Not really. I just keep thinking about things. Like what? Everything just seems so strange. But then some things seem so familiar. But I don't know why. Anything in particular? This house. I feel like I've been here before. And then, earlier today I found this stuffed animal. It was a, a fish in the woods. And, for a second, it glowed. But then it didn't. And... there was this girl that I swore I knew. A girl? From the diner? Oh, no. Um... I met her in the woods. Have you ever... experienced that? Where you... you see someone or something you think you know, but you don't? Like deja vu. Yeah, I guess. I've been meaning to ask you. Where did you come from... before you met up with Anthony? Oh. Uh... I was coming from home just a couple of blocks away from the depot. Home? Your parents' home? Oh. Um... No. Foster home. I don't have any parents anymore. No? What happened to them? I was really young... and, uh... we were... driving late one night. I was sitting in the back seat and my mom was trying to find me a snack. She was looking and looking and, uh... Next thing I remember... There were bright lights and tires screeching and everything went black. And then I woke up a few days later and a woman in a suit told me that my parents were dead. It was my fault. It's not your fault, honey. You have any other family? Uh... I don't, I don't think so. I mean, I've been alone in foster care ever since. Do you think that, maybe you do know that girl from the camp? I don't, I don't think so. I mean... I've been in a lot of homes last 10 years, but, uh... I-I feel like I would have remembered her. Maybe you know her from before? Before? Remember, dear. Remember. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Good morning, sleepyheads. Time to rise and shine. [GROANING] Do we have to go home today? Yes, today's the day, but not until noon which means there's time for breakfast and a all over camp game of Red Rover. So, everyone, let's get dressed, go the bathroom, brush your teeth, and then head to the cafeteria with your group, okay? Do we all have to? Yes, even you, Grumpy Gus. Let's go! Chop, chop! [ALL] Red rover, red rover, send Ruth right over. [ALL] Red rover, red rover, send Christian right over. Red rover, red rover, send Mason right over. Red rover, red rover, send Connor right over. [ALL] Red rover, red rover, send... [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - Alright. You like the colors? - Alright. - Dad, they're really pretty. - Awesome. If you would do the honors, young lady. - Ready to make your wish? - Yeah. Your sissy's gonna blow out the candles. - One more. - Keep blowing. Almost. Almost! Yay! - Say, "Good job, sissy." - Good job, honey? You're getting so big, I can't believe how many candles you have. [BABY CRYING] [LEONARD] Buh-bye. Bye-bye. Bye now. So long. Good luck to you. Especially you, you'll need it. Buh-bye. Bye-bye. Thanks for taking care of us. Alright. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Alright, everybody, let's go. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [PANTING] [SIGHS] Oh, man. [CLEARS THROAT] Uh, did you miss your bus? No. Okay, well, look, kid, camp is over. So, uh, you gotta go. Listen, I wasn't part of any camp, alright. I just wanna sit here for a minute. Minute's up. What's your... Fish. Were you gonna ask me what my problem was? I'll tell you. I am a 38-year-old camp counselor, which is essentially a nanny. - Where did you get that? - What? This? I don't know. Some kid found it. And now, it is going in the trash. Smells awful. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Hello? Can I have that fish, please, Please? - Why? - Because it's important. Oh, yeah? Very funny. To who? To me. I-I'm pretty sure it's mine. You're just gonna throw it away anyway. Why does it matter? - Fine. - Thank you. Are they here for you? Yeah. And they're your aunt and... You know what? I don't care. I've got to go. Leave my camp. Good luck to you and your fish. Hello, my sweet. We brought you sweets. There's a muffin in the bag. Thank you. What's that you got there? It's Fish. And it's not just any fish. It's my Fish. It's magical. [UPBEAT MUSIC] And the perfect streak continues. That is such a beautiful house, guys. It's just like the one we stayed in at camp. Oh, I'm so glad you had fun. Emma, dear, there's someone here with a delivery for you. - For me? - Yes, ma'am. Let's go. - Hey. - Hi. Come on. Do you remember me? Yeah. From the woods. You saw the Fish glow too. I did. Pretty magical, huh? I guess, yeah. Do you know where you found this? I didn't mean to steal it. I just didn't think anybody would miss it. Well... the truth is I-I did miss it. See, I actually made this with my mom when I was about your age. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah, and I, I thought I had lost it forever. I thought I lost a couple things forever, actually. - But I was wrong. - What else did you lose? It might just be in that toy trunk. [BRIDGET GIGGLES] No, I don't think so. You see... when I was your age I had a little sister too... that I'd forgotten. I thought I lost her. Did you find her? I did. You see, this fish doesn't just glow. It has a lot more magic to it. I found this Fish and I found my sister too. Really? Who is she? - Me? - Um-hm. But how? I mean, I don't remember. Well, we were in an accident when you were just a baby. And then afterwards, we were separated. I, I don't know what happened and I had forgotten or I would have come to find you before. How did you find me? Well, that is a very interesting and unbelievable story. It all started at a bus depot. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] There it is. What was once lost, now is found. Yep. Another job well done. As if there was any doubt that we couldn't pull it off again. Reunited. Feels so good. I love happy endings. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Alright, that is all of us. Let's go. Johnny, Miss Bridget and I are watching you. Can you bring up the rear and make sure we don't lose a few on the way? Alright, let's go. Alright, come on guys. Come on. Come on. Do you think we can go to our house in the woods this weekend? Maybe. I'll ask Miss Kathleen and Miss Melissa if I can have a couple days off. I'm so glad you work at the home now and we can be together always. Me too. How was school today? - Good. - Yeah? What did you do? We had our Valentine's Day party and decorated our classroom. Nicole's mom brought cookies and cupcakes for the whole class. Having extra recess and making Valentimes was fun. Valentines. That's what I said, Valentimes. [GIGGLING] Okay. And we learned all about Saint Valentime and about other saints. So Valentine's day was named after a saint? Uh-huh. He was a guy who was in prison and he wrote love letters to a girl. And then they gave him a holiday. I don't know if that's the full story but okay. - It's true. - Okay. So what other saints did you learn about? Um... I can't remember. Hold on. These. Hmm. "Saint Patrick. Saint Nicholas or Saint Nick." Oh, here he is. "Saint Anthony." I know one of those. You do? The real one? No, but he was named after him, or so he said. Where did you meet him? At the bus depot, and he actually helped me find you. And then he kinda just disappeared. I never got a chance to thank him. Maybe he went back to the bus depot. - We can find him and thank him. - Hm. [EMMA] What's the matter? [MYSTICAL MUSIC] "Saint Jude, patron saint of lost causes. Saint Philomena, patron saint of babies, children and youth." Jude, Phil, Anthony. No. That's impossible. Wow. Miracles do happen. Of course, they do. You just have to believe. I got my sister, didn't I? Yep. Come here. Now, I really wish I had Fish, and I believe she will be waiting for me when we get home. Well, you will see Fish very soon. As our wise mother once said "I promise when you do, it will be magical." Come on. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [ANTHONY] So Bridget and Emma were reunited at last. They lived happily ever after. "And Fish stayed for a while but she knew she had more to do. So Fish swam off for her next adventure."
