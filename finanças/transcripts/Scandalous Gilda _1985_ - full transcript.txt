My God, you are there! You knew you would find us here. What a shame! Do not look at me. - Come! - Do not look at me. What did you want to do? You wanted to humiliate me, didn't you? You tried and you succeeded. If I could look at you... If I could tell you how much... But nothing, nothing... It's horrible! Such a waste... I'm sorry, ma'am. I was not supposed to come here. I love it. We're talking at home tonight. Do not leave me. Don't leave me, please! Do not leave me... - Good evening madam. - My husband is back? He went to lunch. He left me this package for you. - Monsieur told me to listen to him immediately. - Thank you, Maria! You can go. Good evening. We present to you the program for this evening. At 9 p.m., "And came the day of vengeance", with Gregory Peck... - Do you want dinner? - Nope. Tell me, Maria, do you like my husband's mistress? - Mrs... - Tell me, do you like it, is it so beautiful? - I... - I'm going to take a bath and I'm going to bed. You can go, Maria. You didn't always tell me that I am a coward. You are right. Inside you must have something diabolical, perverse... You knew everything and you came to the cabin see me, spy on me. I don't have the courage to see you at home. You took everything from me. I have no courage. I no longer have the strength to see you at home. Let me explain, just explain... I don't know what else to say. God, I feel bad... And you feel bad, but you can't do anything! For once, please. try to imagine. Do you want to be my friend? At least this time avoid writing about my hypocrisy. The subterfuge, the vulgarity of a story of betrayal. See, believe me or not, I love you. But now I can't stay a moment without her. Now I can't. I'll be crazy. Try to understand, that's how it is. Sooner or later, this will end. I had to tell someone. Aren't you my best friend? Mary... Mrs... What's up ma'am? Do you want to do me a favor? Come near me. - Yes. - Sit down. - Is anything wrong? - What, ma'am? Tell me the truth, Maria. Am I so ugly? My child... You're so beautiful. - What do I have to do? My child, when it doesn't work between husband and wife... no one is to blame. Go away! Such a waste... You didn't always tell me that I am a coward. You are right. Inside you must have something diabolical, perverse... You knew everything and you came to the cabin see me, spy on me. He's crazy. A coffee please. Hello. Here is the program for the day. A cappuccino without foam. I'm calm. Why do you care where I am? Oh, you're interested. Why would I come? Because it's a beautiful day And I went to the sea. I hope you'll be smarter or less vulgar to take her to the hotel. But she doesn't go to the hotel, She is too good, this female dog. Does she make love better than me? Say it! Does she make love better than me? I want to know. Maybe you forgot. Does she make love better than me? Does she do things to you? Say... Is she doing better than me? I need to know. Shut your mouth! I had to wait for this, from someone like you... Can you give me a light, please! What? Yes. You drive weird... - Yes, I was singing. I was having fun. - It's not serious. Be careful one day singing will kill you. You are right. I have fun. - How much do I owe for the cappuccino? - 700 lira. I was thinking, if you want... - Where is she? - Currency. Guard, guard! Now you have to be careful. You... you have to be careful. Shall we eat something together? Good morning! - Do you want to kill me yet? - May I know what you want from me? - Me? - There's no one else here. - Nothing. - You are crazy. You have already noticed. Usually it takes longer. Not too much, just a little more. Or my condition has worsened, or you have a special intuition. - May I invite you to lunch? - That would be even worse. - Can I go? - Where? I mean, do you have direction? - We take a few steps. - Or here? Yes here. Take a look, it's nice. You do not see? There is air, sunshine. A few steps before lunch. It's good for the appetite. - Don't tell me no. - OK. - There is the north over there... - It's the south. Oh, you knew that too... - What did you say? - Nothing. - Are we going home? - Are you tired already? - I don't want to go back to Rome. - As you prefer. Excuse me! Earlier, I was having fun. I was singing. Looks like you too... Does this happen often? - Almost never. - And you? I sing all the time when I'm in my car. When I'm in the car, I always sing Carmen. - Do you like Carmen? - It's awesome. - Do you like the character of Carmen? - I do not know her. - This is the story of a woman who thinks she is free. - She isn't? - Nope. Love holds her prisoner. - And then? - Love kills her. - It's a bad story. Don Jose kills her with a knife. With a Navajo dagger. My role is not Don Jose. I am Escamilio, the baritone. I'm the baritone, don't you believe me? Pay attention. Listen! Hey, where are you going? It's not very pretty what you did. Come on, talk to me sincerely. I was singing Toreador, I was giving my best of myself, and you left me there... Listen to me! I want to invite you to lunch. I risked my life for this. I even lost my hat. It was a hat... I'm hungry. Help me a little. I feel in trouble. Pay attention! Slowly slowly... It is a dangerous exercise, I saw him at the Toni circus. It is to give an air of joy. - I just wanted some mozzarella. - Yeah? I exaggerated a bit. And the cashier was puzzled. But... Are you happy now? You don't eat? - I'm not hungry. - Then why did you take all this? - It's party time. - You're really weird. I do not know. - Maybe I was wrong. - Because of what? I shouldn't have insisted. Everything was ridiculous. Dad, stop thinking. No more sounds either? I do not know what to say. Seriously...I don't know what to say. Why are you so sad? You see? I'm wrong again. I was wrong... It is better to remain silent. It does not matter. - It is better to remain silent. - You like? I asked you if you like. You may not answer me right away. Take a good look at me. Since I can say what I see... or that I feel... - Do you have intuition? - You know I'm shy? I wonder what would be happened if you weren't. I exaggerate, but timidly. I am too shy. I have to give a phone call. Why? Please don't call. Please be nice. - Why? - No phone call. I don't want new tears, do it for me. Do it for me. Just now, at the bar, I heard. Earlier? When? At the bar, you raised your voice... unintentionally... Don't do that anymore. Wipe yourself. Are we going to sit down? - Excuse me. - It's not serious. Tell me... Where are you going? Bad question. Answer: "Nowhere." Where are you from? That's what I know about it I saw the number on the car. What are you doing? What do you do for a living? - Nothing. - Nothing? Nothing. But you, are you doing something right? - Are you a singer? - Singer? No. - I'm an animator. - Animator in a cabaret. No, I'm an animator. Animals for cartoons. - I make cartoons. - It's awesome. It is very hard work. 24 drawings per second. What? Each second of the film is made up of 24 drawings. 1440 drawings per minute. 80,400 drawings per hour. - It's frightening. - Do you see that? - And now what do you do? - Do you mind if I smoke a cigar? - Nope? Smoke. - It does not bother me. Almost everyone is angry against the cigar. Now... I think of a story. It's a weird movie... That's why we got off the highway, when I drive, my ideas come to me. - I sing and I have my ideas. - Oh yes? - Wait a minute. - Where are you going? Wait a minute. What are you doing with all those leaves? A little patience, my sweet mystery wife. A bit of patience. Give me a hand. - What do you want to do? - A little patience. And There you go! Work tools... Look here. And these. Your attention... - The Scandalous Gilda. - That's the title of my story. It's beautiful, isn't it? It's his story. He's one of the characters main points in my story. He's not really the main character, he is one of the protagonists of my story. The producer told me that today erotic genres were doing well in the market. You always have to consider the producer. I decided not to be too subtle. By cutting off the bull's head... Yes, it's a love story. A fantastic story. What color to put here...? I think the red... Here is the color red. And we make it red... Then make a black stripe. Do you know what this character is? It has a curious name. His name is... Mr. Cazz... And the name is Ino... Family name.. - This is... - Mr. Cazzino. - And the Scandalous Gilda? - Imagine who it is. Who? The scandalous Gilda is... a young bird. Once in a remote place... on the outskirts of Seville, a village who was called Cazziglia. Our history tells us what's going on between one and the unconscious M.Cazzino... when one day, The Scandalous Gilda came to Cazziglia City. You wanted to stay with me, feel more alive... You wanted to give me feelings of peace. Comfort this desire on your part which will grow like the sky... You wanted to stay with me you and your tobacco and I smoke... You smoke for me and me... to satisfy any of your desires, I would like to cross... the great sea. You are my cinnamon stick for breakfast... You are my consolation my cinnamon stick... Sometimes you're asleep with a messy natural... to satisfy any of your desires, I would like to cross... the great sea... You are my can stick, and I am your condemnation... Light my cigarette. You know what? I don't know how this will end. I miss something... I miss the end of my film. The end of my story. You don't have an idea? It can't end like this. - And the Scandalous Gilda? - Nothing. She disappears into nothingness. She goes back to where she came from or maybe it was just a fantasy. Or maybe it was just imaginary. I want to make love WITH YOU. Let's end politely. You have to believe me, I didn't mean to offend you. I was a fool. I didn't have to do this. If you want, I will be correct again. Let's not stop there, please. - The car isn't over there, it's on the other side. - Yes, but the hotel is there. You didn't want to sleep with me before? Do you want to do it here? Yes. No no... You are sure? I don't want you... Mr. Cazz...Ino, here is the Scandalous Gilda! - Your papers please. - Oh yes. So! There was no mustache... - The lady's papers. - Sure. He asks for the lady's papers. - The lady's papers. - Do you have luggage? - Yeah. No. - Then you pay in advance. - How much? - 502,400 lira. - Keep the rest. - Thanks. - Room 323, 3rd floor. - Thanks. - Don't take that cigar. Here! - Excuse me. I have to undress alone or do you do it? you undress alone or do I? - I don't even know your name. - Do you need it? - My name is... - No need. Listen. If you want... we can go. - If you want, go ahead! I'm staying. - Listen to me... - Tell me. You are dressed, I am no longer. So what? It's not that. I think I can get naked. The thing is, I feel uncomfortable. I feel ridiculous. - I wish... - Isn't that what you wanted? What I mean, if I wanted you did you want... Too many verbs... Who said I don't? Why? You are compassionate a good person. What are you saying? I'm afraid. Why are you afraid? - I'm afraid of myself. - We are a river that takes any form day and night good and bad that forms, deforms, that we constantly fill And no one becomes a home for us. We are constantly moving. We are constantly moving... and then... I don't remember. Don't you wanna know my name? I want to know yours. The farm! I want to see you again. Won't you see me again? So you don't want to see me again? - Won't you pay me? - How? - I asked you, won't you pay me? - You're kidding? You don't think I slept in vain with someone like you! If you think, you have to get it out of your mind. - Listen... - Do not touch me. You are not serious. What do you think? We meet on the highway, you act like a fool, you talk a lot of bullshit on the pussy, the Scandalous Gilda... And you want to sleep with me. Why? Try asking yourself. All this is done with prostitutes. Without wasting much time. Pa, pa, pa... Whores get paid. I think you know that. It is usually paid in advance. Honestly, I... I do not know... extraordinary... Sure. Well... How much should I give you? How much do you want? Tell me what you want. 500 lira. How much did you say...? 500 lira. You are really crazy. I've never been with a whore. Never. I've always wanted, but i was scared... All these diseases... I don't know, maybe I was ashamed. Anyway, now the whore baptized me. I am happy. Really. I'm happy, it was great. It was nice... And it only cost me 500 lira. Pay me! Yes yes... For you. What can you buy with 100,000? Or 500,000 lire... Or 1,000,000? From now on, everything costs more. Okay? Much more.

Do what you have to do quickly. Want to know something? You think I love you. Yes. 'Cause you got me and you got me left with a few drops of life. I could be pregnant.

Did you understand what I said? Do you want to marry me, live forever with me? You will have a good life with me. Did you hear what I told you? - Do you understand what I say! - A good life with me? Is that why you want to die? No. I don't know how to get out of all this, but I don't know how to do it. I really do not know. Then I like it... and then... It's to scare dogs. It's not loaded. It's not even good to hunt dogs. I don't know how it happened, but now we are bound to each other. Everything we don't do to each other we do it among ourselves.
