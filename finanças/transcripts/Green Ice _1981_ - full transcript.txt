(upbeat music) (bangs) In Mexico it never rains. (upbeat music) - What's the trouble? - If I knew that I'd be flying. (pops) - [Woman] You headed to the coast? - Yeah. - Can you drop me at Las Hadas? - Of course. - Great. - Why don't you give a tweak to your barasteic micro switch but watch your TOT. (engine rumbling) (upbeat music) I'm Joe Wiley. - Great. - What do they call you? - Holbrook. - [Joe] That's it? - [Holbrook] That's it. (engine rumbling) - I thought it was the igniter circuit. - How'd you know that? - I'm an electronics engineer. I mean that's what I do for a living, actually I think of myself more of an ideas man, one good gimmick set for life. - I thought most of the good gimmicks have been taken? - Oh no I've had at least 100 of them. Everything from suntan bells to mung beans. - What are mung beans? - Bean sprouts. Unfortunately rats ate my first harvest before I could sell 'em, that put me back about three grand. I got an exwife who wants more alimony, they've upped the rent on my apartment, and oh yeah, I just lost my job. - So that's your story huh? - That's it. What's yours? - I'm from Philadelphia, I live in Mexico City that's my helicopter and I'm on my way to Las Hadas for a quiet weekend. Make a right up ahead. - You got it. (upbeat music) - [Holbrook] So what made you choose Mexico? - Well actually I missed the plane to Hawaii. And Mexico seemed affordable and nice. - Have you ever heard of La Mordida? - No, what's that. - That Wiley is the bite (snaps), the Spanish word for inflation. Maybe you should give Las Hadas a try. - What's there? - There are a lot of wealthy women there. It's a gold mine for any man with a little charm and initiative. - I really impressed you huh? - There's only one problem. - What's that? - Women are going for younger men these days. - Well nothing beats experience. - Except stamina. (upbeat music) - I think I'm wearing the wrong car. - Don't sell yourself short Wiley. You'll do alright. You got a good body. (horn beeping) - [Porter] What a surprise madam, welcome to Las Hadas. Let me help you. - [Man] Senora Holbrook. - Hello Carlos. - So delighted to see you. We didn't think you were coming. Senor Argenti will be so happy. - The man in the blue shirt, do the impossible, find him a room for the night. - Of course. (gentle music) - Do you know how much this room costs? - $284 Senor. - A day! - Si Senor (speaking foreign language). (engine rumbling) - Hello. What the hell? - I thought this was my suite? - Si Senor, this apartment is for Senor Prentis. You see? (speaking foreign language) - Well I'm, I'm sure you can find Mr. Prentis a better suite. (speaking foreign language) - Sorry about the mix up. - Oh that's perfectly alright. Come on, I've wasted enough time. - You suspicious bastard. (phone ringing) Hello? - [Man] Mr. Prentis. The samples have been delivered. - What? - [Man] In the drawer beside your bed. (clicking) - [Joe] I'm looking at them now. - [Man] You're familiar with our operation. We propose the following, 6,000 carats at 500 a carat. The quality of course equal to those you now have. - That sounds reasonable. - [Man] We will show you further samples in the morning. - Where? - Playa Soledad at nine o'clock. (gentle music) - 6,000 at 500. (gentle music) - Liliana, you look divine. (gentle music) - Hi. Are you here alone? - Yeah my wife couldn't make it. - Oh that's too bad, may I ask why? - She just divorced me. - Oh, did she take you for everything? - No I got to keep the goldfish. - Looks good to me. - Oh lunch tomorrow? - I can't. - Would it make any difference if I were rich? - But you aren't, are you Wiley? - Isn't she a little out of your price range? - Not for long. I believe you have a Mr. Prentis registered here? - Yes. - Would you make sure that he gets this? - For you Senor it would be a pleasure. - Mr. Prentis? - [Prentis] Yes thank you. - Oh I'm glad you liked them. As the first step let me propose 6,000 carats, at $600 a carat the quality the same as the samples. (engine rumbling) (waves splashing) Hi. - We thought you might have gone to the wrong beach. They all look so much alike. You know Mr. Prentis? (thuds) (crying out) (gun firing) - [Prentis] Drive him into the sea! (waves crashing) (guns firing) (cries out) (waves crashing) (guns firing) (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) - Welcome aboard. (chattering) Out. Here eat this, it'll help you get your strength back. Pull your pants down. - Wait, what? - Well unless you wanna wait until it gets infected. - Alright, I can do it. - Here hold this. Well. - Ow, how does it look? - You'll survive as long as you don't look down. So you're really an electronics engineer? - [Joe] Yeah and I'm a pretty good one too. - Hmm, it's hard to picture. You're lucky it's only a flesh wound. - Yeah well it's my flesh. - It is also your fault. - Well I'm sorry if I lost you some business. - What's that supposed to mean? - There's only one difference between you and me, you just happen to be in a higher price range that's all. (cries out) (upbeat music) Hey okay, I'm sorry. How'd you know I'd be out there? - I accidentally overheard some people taking bets. - What, on whether I could swim to Hawaii? - On whether you were a crook or just a fool. - And which way did you bet? - I put a little on both. (upbeat music) (horn beeping) (speaking foreign language) - This is Mr. Wiley he'll be staying with us for a few days. (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) - Welcome to my house. I'm sure you'd like to rest up. Josephina will show you to your room. (dramatic music) - What's the matter? - Talk to me Wiley. - About what? - Anything. Tell me about one of your gimmicks. - What'd that priest say? You know what your trouble is? You talk to much. - It's my sister. A few weeks ago she went up into the mountains with a group of students. - Where? - Columbia. She's been reported missing. That's all I know. - Why South America? - Because as the younger sister she was always trying to go one step further than me and I had already gotten as far as Mexico. - And your parents? - Mother had the money, dad the pedigree. The perfect match til they drank a hole in the marriage. I came a long as a sort of penalty for a mad moment in a parking lot after a party in Scarsdale. - And your sister? - Kerry? She was an act of despair eight years later. Mother left the bulk of her estate to me with a provision for Kerry and enough money for dad to keep his wallet working. - Does your father know about Kerry? - He wouldn't be interested. - What's he do? - When he's not drinking? He's connected with the diamond business. - Then he's not hurting. - Oh if you think that money is the answer to everything. - I never had enough to know. - If you did, would your life be different? - Well I could be with a woman like you and not feel insecure. - Do you feel insecure now? - In one way. But in another I feel good enough. - Which way is that? - This way. (water splashing) (laughing) - Meno. - As I was on my way back to Columbia I decided to surprise you. I hope I'm not intruding. - Of course not. I'll just tell Josephina to prepare your room. - Yes just for one night, thank you. - Well I must change. Wiley you'll find dry clothes in your room. - Mr. Wiley. I don't believe we've met. How do you know Holbrook? - Oh we met while I was drowning. - You do seem to have a fondness for water. How long do you plan to stay here. - Why? - I like to know better the man I find in the early hours of the morning with my fiancee. - You didn't tell me you were engaged. Are you? - Not only do you ask to many questions but you always ask the wrong ones. - Well who is that guy anyway? - He's a very important man in Bogata. - Are you gonna go away with him? - He can help me find my sister. Can you? (gun firing) (gun firing) - You're a very good spectator Mr. Wiley. You do not interfere too much. - No more games tonight Meno. Excuse me. I must speak with Josephina. - I understand that you're an electronics engineer. - That's right. - In Columbia I have electronics for surveillance. The best experts in the world build my installation. You should come and see it and maybe work for me. - What makes you think I'm good enough? - I'm incredibly intuitive when it comes to judging a man, I'm seldom wrong. Come, see everything, perhaps you can improve on it. I pay handsomely and you could even steal a little. Think about it. (clicking) - Never sneak up on a man with a gun in his hand. - Meno said to say goodnight. (gun firing) - You, you let him win, why? - He needs to win and I need to let him. - And what if your sisters dead and he responsible? - Then I'll kill him. Let's go to bed Wiley. (humming) - Good morning. - Good morning. - Where's Mussolini this morning? - He's gone, he thanks me, he sends me his heart and says goodbye to you. He hopes you'll come to Columbia with me. - All my gear is down at Las Hadas. - As far as Las Hadas is concerned you were never registered. - Oh that's terrific. I'm out 2,000 bucks. - Well look at the bright side you get to go to Bogata. How much do you know about emeralds Wiley? - [Joe] Well they have a way of causing me trouble. - [Liliana] 95% of the world's finest stones come from Columbia, the government gave up trying to control them years ago, they gave it over to a private concession. - [Joe] And Argenti? - [Holbrook] He is the concession. - [Joe] Oh, and he's the ticket to finding your sister. - [Liliana] Precisely. - [Joe] And I'm invited. - [Liliana] There are no gimmicks down their Wiley. - [Joe] Just emeralds. - [Liliana] Yes, just emeralds. $25,000 a carat for finding little green chip in the mud, makes killing easy. (dramatic music) (bells ringing) Tell Miguel I'm here. (eerie music) - You are now in the very heart of my concession. We are in the center of a city but one word from me and the perimeter is closed and up here I'm in my own fortress. Every two days the emeralds are brought here from the mines. 60 out of every 100 are good, 30 are very good and 10 are the finest in the world. This is my friend Jaap, a diamond cutter, the best. He was called a supremo when he worked for me in Milano, we left together. How long ago was it, 10 years? - 11. - 11? I left a world behind and started a new life. The only thing that remains from the old world is Jaap. He has stayed by my side through it all. He never complains but he misses the diamonds, like me. - Meno, Meno forget diamonds. We don't even mention the word. - You're right weight for weight and quality for quality the emerald is better hmm? - No. - Here we keep all our data, who is interested in emeralds and what they wish to buy. We trade mostly outside the country to avoid unnecessary government inconveniences. We've even done business at certain resorts. It's nice to combine business with pleasure don't you agree Mr. Wiley? Since Holbrook seems to trust you and I in turn trust her judgment, I will now show you something very few people are privileged to see. Other than that elevator there's no way in. - No fire escape? - Nor stairs. We are completely isolated from above and below. - What is above? - The sky. - I'm impressed. - Is it not ingenious to have my fortress in the sky instead of the usual hole in the ground? Now I will show you how I Menos Abastiano Agenti am the most fortunate of men. Follow me please. (dramatic music) You may touch if you wish. (dramatic music) 60 or 70 millions dollars worth and tomorrow there'll be more. (dramatic music) This is Jochim Kellerman, chief of my control section. Mr. Wiley shall we continue? (dramatic music) This vault is cadmium based steel, there isn't a torch in existence hot enough to cut through it. - How do the stones get here? (rumbling) - All delivery from the mines come here directly by helicopter. A plane one mile up in the sky can set off the alarm and if anyone landed on this roof, how would they get down? You're an expert. Can it be improved upon? - Not by me. - Mr. Wiley we have not met, I'm am General Botaro, the Senora told me you are very interested in our ancient excavations. - Is that a fact? - General Botaro has given us a jeep. - Oh terrific. - Thought you'd like the idea. - But the mountains, the bandidos, I will send an armed escort with you, it will be safer. - General Botaro Wiley is a crack shot, aren't you Wiley? - Yeah my aims getting better all the time. (whacks) (engine rumbling) This is worse than third avenue. (engine rumbling) (gentle music) - I'm sorry for your grief Senora but I've stood by many graves, my sadness has dried up. The army killed your sister. Their army, the emeralds and a man's greed. (gentle music) - Would you like some water? Hey, you know it's not against the rules to cry in here. (crying) (gentle music) (engine rumbling) - Hey, Holbrook! Hi. - Miguel. - I'm sorry about your sister. She was a friend and a compatriot. - Is there anything I can do? Is there anything you need? - We're on our way back into the hills, with a jeep we might stand a better chance. - It's yours. - It's good to have you with us. Philippe (speaking foreign language). - You're not really serious about joining up with these guys are you? - Why not? - Well isn't one death enough? - But you don't understand Wiley, she believed in their cause. - Yeah but you don't. You're just taking her place. - I'm going up there. (wind whistling) - My father was loco. He was born here like me (speaking foreign language). So he sees this Coca Cola billboard, the good life and he goes to New York as an illegal and spends his whole life hiding. I learned to hide before I learned to walk. But sooner or later you get fed up with hiding. The day I was 17, I walked into the Draft Board, put a bomb in a fire room and boom, 5,000 kids don't go to Vietnam because of me. That was the day I started to run. And her little sister helped me come home. I get back, I find the land is rotting, it's belly fat while the people starve. 12 year old kids crawling in the mines for a lousy seven pesos a day. But now, we fight. - How do you plan to finance this operation? - Come on I'll show you. - Where are we going? - This guy's digging up emeralds all over his farm. So we made a little trade, we pick his coffee beans, he gives us the emeralds. - A great deal for the old guy. - We pick three or four days for emeralds, in a month we come back to pick his coffee. And all we gotta do is get 'em down the mountain. - Yeah without getting our throats cut. - Hey Lucho. - Hey Miguel. - Come meet some tourists from New York. They think coffee grows in cups. La Senorita Holbrook and Senor Wiley, Lucho. - Please sir me casa is su casa amigos. - Tomorrow we dig for green ice. (whacks) (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) - How much? - Oh not the best 300 a carat maybe, say 200 carats. - 300 a carat? - $60,000 and the old man still wants to grow his coffee beans. (rattles) Philippe! You're my brother right? - Yeah. - You look sick. You're not well. (speaking foreign language) You see, he got the disease of the fat bellies! Stealing from his brothers. (gun firing) We must stop the sickness now before it spreads and kills all of us. (knocks) (speaking foreign language) - This is for you. - Oh no senor. You are in my house no. - It is the custom of my country, the taller guy brings the bottle. (speaking foreign language) - It's so peaceful and I can hear the... - (speaking foreign language) And cannot you hear the (speaking foreign language) in New York Senor? - In New York you hear sirens. Well here's to emeralds. - No Senor, I cannot drink to them. They are a curse on my land. - Why? - If the government knew they would come, take away my land, they send me away. It is my father's land, he grew coffee. - But with the money you could buy more land, grow more coffee. - More, more, more is the devil Senor. I do not know in your country, in this country the devil is green (speaking foreign language). It is not true in your country Senor. - It is true in my country the devil is green too. (speaking foreign language) - What's that? (speaking foreign language) - What do I do with it? - Feel good? - But I wanna ask you about your coffee. - Si? - How many beans do you get off a tree? - 2,000. - And how many coffee beans to a pound? - 2,000 Senor. - So you get one pound of coffee for every tree? - Si, si. - And where do you sell 'em? - I sell in the town. - You know in New York coffee is very expensive. You could get double if you exported direct. - Si? But I have no friend in New York Senor. - You do now. (speaking foreign language) - To my friend in New York. (cups clinking) (speaking foreign language) (spits) (fire roars) (laughing) - Hey we thought you'd run out on us. - No such luck. - Another five minutes you'd have missed your ride. - And all the fun that goes with it. (engine rumbling) (speaking foreign language) (engine rumbling) - I'll stop around the next curve then you take over. (engine rumbling) (speaking foreign language) - No. - (speaking foreign language) Identification. What are you doing on this road? - We got lost. - Coming from where? - We were sight seeing in Lahva. - What is your destination? - Back to the capital. (guns firing) - There's enough money here for a General, it's filth. Go and remember you've got the emeralds. Just get past the next village and you're okay. - Let's go Wiley. (engine rumbling) There's the Bogata road. (engine rumbling) (tires squealing) (clangs) - Welcome to Barbosa Senor. - Where's Holbrook? Where's Holbrook? Ah you bastards! (speaking foreign language) (crying out) - Mothers! Where's Holbrook? (speaking foreign language) (crying out) (bangs) - Shit! (speaking foreign language) (crying out) (speaking foreign language) - No! No! No! No! (thuds) (crying out) (pigs squealing) (speaking foreign language) (pigs squealing) (screaming) (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) (engine rumbling) - Barbossa is a terrible prison no? You were fortunate I came when I did. When you go home you'll have a good story to tell huh? - I want you to know that I'm sorry about what's happened. - I got off lucky compared to my sister. - I should have stopped you from doing it. - You couldn't have stopped me. No one could have stopped me. I knew what the risks were. Anyway we failed. We have got to come up with something better. - Like what? - I don't know maybe we could hit the mines before they take the shipment to the concession. - After yesterday they're gonna be ready and waiting. - If we could only get our hands on that helicopter after it leaves the mine. - Why are we settling for one little shipment? Why don't you just break into Argenti's sky vault and take it all? - Oh if we only could. - Yeah we could. We could if we were a pair of lunatics but there's only one crazy person here, it's not me. I quit. You're so wound up you're about to pop. - You've quit a lot of things in your life haven't you Wiley? - Yeah and I started a lot of 'em too. You took my money didn't you? - I thought you'd stay longer. - I was here, I would have stayed. I don't do everything for money you know. - Alright I was wrong, I had no right to take your money I just wanted you here. - Why? Because you think I'll do anything you want? - No! Because I think I love you. - But you'd love me a lot more if I could figure out a way to break into that concession. - No, but I'd be forever grateful. (knocks) - Alright, let's hear it. - We've got a plan to rob the concession. - The concession? You're crazy we wouldn't get past the lobby. - We don't have to. My plan starts on the top floor. - What's he talking about? - What if I told you that Wiley can put us on the roof? - Does he know how to fly? - No but I got a friend who does. (engine rumbling) - Senor Claude? - I am Claude you must be Thomas. - Yes, can I take your bag? - Oh no, no, no I always carry my own bag but you can get uncle Wiley's. - Gracias Senor. - Took the words right out of my mouth old buddy. - I have kept it hidden for eight years. Even you didn't know. - I don't want to know. They let you live, you are a king here. - A king in exile. Barred from my native country. You will make a ring for me, with emeralds but with the diamond at the core, a wedding ring. It will be the last piece you will make for me in this God forsaken land. - You really believe the diamond concession will forgive you when you are married to her? - Her father will make sure that they do. - Meno you underestimate them. They do not forget so easily. - We will see. (helicopter chopping) - What do you think? - It looks a whole lot better than the bean sprouts. - It better be, they got pigs here instead of rats. Can you get us up there? - Sure. - How sure? - 80 20. I can get us up there if you can take care of the pigs. - All but one. And he's yours all you gotta do is get him to say his name. - You like it. - I love it. (gentle music) - Very nice. How much do I owe you? - Only 2,000, it was a very short game. - But a sweet experience. How would you like it? - Cash will do nicely. - Cash you shall have, for shopping. I want you to look exceptionally elegant this evening for a reception. - This evening? - To introduce my future wife. You don't look happy. - No, I was just a little surprised that's all. On second thought I would rather have a check. - Why? - Well so I can say it was written by the hand of Meno S. Agenti. What does the S stand for? Salvatore? - Sebastiano. - Menos Sebastian Agenti. - Meno Sebastiano Agenti. (ominous music) - Am I going somewhere? Soon? Now? What the hell is going on? - I would have thought it obvious. The holiday's over. You're on a direct flight to New York this evening. - And what if I'm not ready to go? - Then Hotada would be happy to help you. You will find in your suitcase a substantial sum for what you did. - [Joe] How much? - More than you're worth Mr. Wiley, $1,000. - Yeah well I think I'm worth $10,000. - 10,000, for what? - For finding the flaw in your system. - A flaw? Impossible. - See for yourself. - What's all this? - There's a miscalculation in your electronic system, whoever made out that equation should go back to school. I could break into your building blindfolded. - Prove it. - How much time have I got? - 24 hours Mr. Wiley. (dramatic music) (whooshing) - Now remember left hand, warm her up, up you go, right hand down you come, left hand up, right hand down. You got it? - Yeah. - Good. You nervous? - No, scared shitless. - Just hold onto this. - Alright. (whooshing) - Alright now, did you get that, warm her up, down you go. - Yeah, did you take out insurance? (laughing) - I got a feeling you don't like heights. - I can't swim to good either cowboy, what else is new? - I'll tell you what? You just hand on to your butt and Claude's cloud hoppers will get you there sitting down all the way. (whooshing) Let's fly! (whooshing) (gentle music) - [Miguel] Jesus I'm already going the wrong way. (gentle music) Hey somebody move that tree! (gentle music) (rustling) (whooshing) (gentle music) - Whoa.

(gentle music) - Where is everybody? - The guests haven't arrived yet. You might say that we're a little early. I invited them all for tomorrow. Tonight is just for you. - Meno don't play games. What is tonight really about? - I merely wanted to show you what would be yours when you marry me. - I haven't said I'd marry you. - But you must. - Why Meno? Why must I? - Have you seen one of these before? - Yes of course. - Your father wears it. It's the insignia of a very exclusive club, the international diamond concession. I'm forbidden to wear it now. - Why? - There was a theft of some 10 million dollars worth of diamonds, oh I didn't steal them, I was an honest, trusted dealer. But I bought them secretly and then little by little I sold them. Inevitably I was caught by the diamond concession. The penalty is usually death, fortunately I was well connected. They offered me a rather firm exchange, my life for a one way passage to South America. I could continue to live as long as I never set foot outside this continent. - But how would they ever know? - Have you ever had the impression that you were being watched? It's something I've learned to live with ever since I came here. Perhaps I'm mistaken, unfortunately there's only one way to know for sure. Therefore I'm offering, a marriage. A union of diamonds and emeralds. - And with my father's connections you would be allowed to leave. - Not simply to leave, but to return home. - I understand. - You see I could have lied to you. Of course you could live your life without too much interference from me, we could have our playthings, like Mr. Wiley for instance. But for the concession we would be husband and wife. - do you know that your soldiers have killed many people? Have you ever seen the dead lying in the mountains? - Just rebels and thieves. - And my sister? - She consorted with scum. - And that was reason to kill her? - She killed herself. If it wasn't here and now it would have been tomorrow in some other country for some other ridiculous cause. Don't you see Liliana? You can not allow her irresponsible actions to destroy the life that we could have together. I must have your answer. Please. - In the morning Meno. Goodnight.

(dramatic music) - Okay enough. - How much we got? - 50 million but more like 100. - Hey I like you, you come through for us. - I wanna buy you guys a few mobile homes huh? Let's go. - Mobile homes nothing that's peace corp talk. (dramatic music) - Where the hell are your guys? - Relax, the ball games over, we won. - The hell we have. We just emptied a man's bank. You think he's gonna lay around and chalk it up to one for the cause? - He's finished man, it's only a matter of time before he goes down and bang we get our country back. All my life I've fought for this change and now I'm gonna see it with my own eyes. - I hate to disappoint you Miguel but there are a hundred Agenti's out there just waiting their turn. Just because you knock over one doesn't mean another one's not gonna pop up tomorrow. - A hundred Miguel's can pop up tomorrow too. Hey you don't get it do you (speaking foreign language). There's a network out there full of people like me and my brother's and sisters starting fires all over the world, it's global man and me and you go down as Robin Hood's. - Robin Hood he stole from the rich, he didn't blow up airports, he didn't kill hostages. - Say man, today's a whole different strategy. Sometimes you gotta do things you don't like for the cause. - Just remember Miguel we got different causes. Here comes the Cavalry. You wanna jump first. - I don't wanna jump at all. - Alright, keep the line taut. And pray, hard. (whips) (cries out) (ominous music) (speaking foreign language) - Go! Go! (speaking foreign language) (ominous music) (engine rumbling) (wind whistling) (engine rumbling) - Where's Miguel. - He didn't make it. - We're going back for him. - He said go now come on let's get the hell outta here or we'll all end up back in that pig farm. Let's go! (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - It's too late, it's over! You've been living off the people for too long and tonight it ended, it's finished for your kind. - What is he talking about? - Go look in your vault. We took back what you stole. - Get him up. (dramatic music) - I regret, but me you will not take to Barbossa. (snaps) (smashes) - It was the girl. - No it was you, you let them rob me. - It was the girl, I have proof. - You're mad, you know nothing. - All the time you spent with the girl she was working to destroy you. Face the truth, where she is concerned. (smashes) (dramatic music) - You sure this is the right place? - Miguel said this is where they'd find us. (dramatic music) - Trouble. (speaking foreign language) - Canadians actually. - Where are you going? - Fishing. Look out those are fish hooks, you could stick yourself. - We are with Miguel. He is dead. You come with me. I'm going to give you the best boat we've got but you'd better take it now before the yankees who own it get back from sight seeing. - Don't you think we oughta turn the emeralds over to them? - No you hand them stones you hand them their death warrant. (upbeat music) - Well feeling any richer? - They're not ours Wiley. - Well what are we going to do? - We're going to deliver them the way Miguel wanted. - What in care of the revolution? What's their address? Maybe we should just mail one to every family in the country. - If there's something on your mind why don't you just say it? - Why should anything be on my mind? I mean I just risked my life for something that doesn't belong to me and now I'm riding in a stolen boat with someone who hasn't even got the curtesy to tell me where we're going. - My family has a beach house in the Keys. (ominous chord) - They know we're coming? - [Liliana] There's seldom anyone there. - Well that's good, then they won't mind if we don't show for dinner. Here come the marines. (ominous music) (siren bleating) I'll see you on the pig farm. - Mae West stop your engines. We are coming aboard. Mr. and Mrs. Goldenheimer you're American. - That's right. - You're registered out of Miami. - Right. - You're going back to Miami? - We're trying. - It's a long way. - It's home. (speaking foreign language) - Forgive me Senora you have to be patient. We have much trouble with the (speaking foreign language) running marijuana into your country. - A beer lieutenant? - No (speaking foreign language). (speaking foreign language) - Why do you bring guns on a pleasure cruise? - Well these are dangerous waters lieutenant. - Perhaps. - Would you bring your wife out here unarmed? - No, I wouldn't. What is this? - That's a bait well. - This is bait for commercial fishing. Do you have a license? - Well it all came with the boat. - It is illegal. For you it is sport, for a fisherman it is their living. There is a heavy fine. (gentle music) This time I'll let you off with a warning. Senor, Senora. (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) (engine rumbling) (dramatic music) - Ah I don't believe it. - Unfortunately no one else will either. - All for nothing. (dramatic music) (smashes) - It smells a bit musty. - Open the windows. - Anything you say princess. - Nobody uses the place much anymore. Oh this house brings back memories. - Happy ones? - Well it's the only time we ever acted very much like a family. (phone clicking) - Oh the phone's dead. - You expecting a call? There's not much to eat. - I'm not hungry. Who's that? - [Liliana] The postman checking the mailbox. - [Joe] Of an empty house? - Stop being paranoid. - Does Argenti know about this place? - What do you think? - That's what I thought. How far away is the nearest neighbor? - The local store is about a half a mile away. - Yeah well you got a bull horn in case we gotta yell for help? What are you doing? - I thought I'd play some music. - Oh well that's just what we need. We oughta give a party and tell everybody we're back in town. Mussolini and his men could be here any minute you know. - Relax. - I don't wanna stand around here and wait for these people to get here. - Well you're the ideas man, you come up with something. In the meantime I'm gonna go get some food. You need anything? - Yeah, I'd like a Philips head screwdriver, some double sided tape and a soldering iron. (door bangs) - What are you doing? - Oh, I think I've figured out a way to protect this place and maybe ourselves. - I miss you. - Really? - I'm getting used to having you around. - Well that's gonna be a problem if your friend Argenti has anything to say about it. Front door, back door, upstairs. - Let's just forget him shall we? - Oh I'd love to... What was that? - Wiley, come on. - Oh I think one of us oughta stay awake. - Well I have a better idea. Why don't we both stay awake together? - I don't think that, that that's practical. - No, but it could be enjoyable. (gentle music) - How can you think of that at a time like this? - It could be our last night together. (gentle music) (waves crashing) (thudding) (clicks) (electronic beeping) (marching music blaring) (record scratching) (alarm blaring) - CJ, find the fuse box. (alarm blaring) (fizzling) (crying out) (crying out) - [Joe Voiceover] Holbrook we've gotta get the hell out of here, this is madness. (waves crashing) - Wiley. - What? - In case we don't make it-- - Oh don't even mention it. - I just want you to know, what happened last night-- - This is not the time. - Was incredible. - Come on. - [Joe Voiceover] Let's call a taxi and head for Miami. (gun firing) Get the first plane to New York. (gun firing) - I'm gonna head for the beach and try and draw their fire. You, find some cover for yourself. Go! (dramatic music) - [Meno] Kellerman have you found them? - Everything is proceeding as planned. - [Meno] Don't harm the girl. - She is still alive. - [Meno] I'm coming ashore. - That is not wise. - [Meno] Even the diamond concession would understand. Kellerman, wait for me. (dramatic music) (guns firing) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (whacking) (crying out) (guns firing) (dramatic music) - Dear God. (waves crashing) (door thuds) (couch bangs) (dramatic music) - Hello Wiley. (cries out) - Oh what? (crying out) - A dart. Argenti wanted me alive. - Can we get out of this fantasy land now and get back to reality please? (door creaks) (dramatic music) - Not quite yet Mr. Wiley. Not until you return every single stone. - Well we're gonna need a little deep sea diving equipment for that. - Liliana you know me well. Impress upon Mr. Wiley that in times like this it is best not... You? The concession? After all these years, you were the one I trusted. (gun firing) (gun clatters) (thuds) - I warned you Mino, so many times. (upbeat music) - Wiley what exactly are we doing down on the Brooklyn docks? - I got a little business to take care of. It shouldn't take me more than a few minutes. - It's not another gimmick? (whistle blows) - This is just a sample consignment. I should be receiving monthly shipments from now on. - Well be sure to check with me next time. Ask for Linda alright? (clattering) (dramatic music) - What were you doing, counting beans? You'll never learn will you Wiley? - No I guess I'll never learn.
