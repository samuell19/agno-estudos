Oh, Hill! You've seen me come to life. You see me grow. At your peak, you will see me die. You look sexy like that. Are you kiddin' or what? Do I look like I am? Get closer! - OK, so you're not kidding. Closer. Put your hand on Jeta. Come on, Jeta! Come on! And now, make the lionesses roar! The Hill where Lionesses Roar See you. Yep. Let's go. Where were you? I got scared. Go have breakfast. Where you going? - Out. Who with? - Friends. Wait a minute. Leaving without a kiss? You're so beautiful. Stay with your uncle. I'm going to be late. Jeta? Jeta! I was looking for you. Everything alright? Give a puff. Your turn. Come on. The green one now. Jeta? Jeta. I know you're in there. Open the door, Jeta. Open up, sweetheart. Open the door. I told you not to go to the abandoned house. What house? The family one. - Why not? They don't like it. I don't care, it's ours too. People will talk. People talking, people talking, that's all you're worried about. If only your grandfather had divided his estate better, we would all be happier today. A house doesn't give you happiness. You're leaving? I'm enrolling at uni. I don't wanna end up like you. This again? Your dad said the salon will be yours. I don't care. He's not going to decide for me. Behaving like that, you'll end up alone. What's up? Life plans. What have you found again? Plums, I'm going to sell them at the market. Sounds useless. Hey, cockroaches! Did you get your clothes out of a bin or what? Yeah. But at least we don't suck dicks for ours. What's up with people today? Why are you stalking us? I just came here to chill. It isn't your spot. What do you want? Nothing! I'm just chilling. You hang out here a lot. What are you doing? You need some new friends or what? Come on, Qe. Don't be so rude. I'm Li. Zem. Wild child over there's Qe, and this is Jeta. Nice to meet you. Is that your bike? - Yes. Can you drop me off? Sure. Hold on tight. You're all dolled up. When is your reply from uni? - In three or four days. Going out alone? - No, with Qe and Jeta. Go on then. Do you need me? Focus on your education and you'll help us. See you tonight. Bye, kiddies! Bye! Go, go, go! Fuck, I nearly got caught. Look at all I took. Will you open your big black eyes? Keep going straight on! Oh, my love. I flirt with others but I love you. Congrats, girls! Because in this shitty country, it's the only way. Go wash up. You stink! What happened? - Apparently I stink of rabbit's piss. You went to the hutch again! Did you apply? When do they answer? We're going back in four days. Go shave your moustache. - No! Yes, yes! There's a new girl in town. Yeah? Who? I don't know. I've seen her by the big house. - How come? I was around. - Who cares why? What's her name? I don't know. Did she see you? - No. Do you like it? - Yes, a lot. You need to make a place for him. And hide him well. Nobody should see him. What's his name? Chewing-gum. And the bride? - I haven't seen her. Maybe later. Who put this money in my stash? We promised not to interfere in each other's business. That's true. Sorry. Sorry. Zem is cute right? Who's that? Li's future husband. Whatever! Come on, you're gonna hook up with him, being with him every day. It's true, he's so cute. So cute. You're the rabbit girl, right? I'm Lena. Qe. Were you born here? Yes. Do you like this town? It grows on you. I love the parties here. You're not from here? No, I'm from France. I'm on holiday at my grandmother's. The best in your life! Tomorrow, I'm working in town. My friends will be there. Wanna come? Why not. You look like your mother right now. Shut up. There, you're all beautiful, sweetheart. Do you like it? Of course you like it because I'm a pro at my job. Can you believe it? I haven't slept all night because of my husband. All night, honestly. How can someone snore like that? Like a boar! A real boar, I swear! This morning, you know, I had to drink three coffees before coming to work. As soon as I got to the salon, I cleaned everything, from top to bottom, everywhere. That's what I learnt. First clean, then work. I can't stand dirt. Hi! Look who's here! Come on, honey, come sit. My mom made this for us. Say thanks to her. I'll have some later, I already had three coffees. What's up with you? - Jeta says I look like my mom. Oh, god... What a nightmare. I'll fix you. - Go ahead, fix all of this. You know my work. - Oh, you... My work is the best in the world! There, just by magic, like a princess. No... No. I know. Oh, let me make a promise... to you and me... That I will never, ever in my life become a hairdresser. Don't worry, life has other plans for you. I'm not cut out for this. You're blessed to have such a mom. - Enjoy. These are so good. Hello. You alright? You wanna sit? - No, I'm fine. You want ice-cream? - Yes. Rainbow? - Yes. You too? - Sure. See you soon. Have some. - Yeah, yeah. Oh, Lena. Hey, welcome. You coming in? - No. Why not? - I was around, so... Zem is getting ice-cream. He won't be long. Really, I can't. Come tomorrow then, to the old house. See you! - Bye. Yo! Hey, Frenchie! Jeta and Li, right? Qe, I know. What are you doing? Nothing, just hanging... I nearly got caught in the rain. It's so cute how you talk. You can tell? - A bit. I rarely come to Kosovo. - Why? I don't know. It seems hard on my dad. Expats tend to forget about us very fast. Is it better there or here? Here. Yeah, right. Really, it's different. Tell us about Paris. - What can I tell you? Anything, something. - It's beautiful. There's a lot to do: theatres, cinemas... It depends on your situation. We also have theatres. It's stifling there. Here, you're freer. Are you actually in Paris? - Yes. Can you see the Eiffel Tower from your window? Not from my neighbourhood. What do you do with your days? We stay here, in the village, the hills. We wait. You never left the country? - No. We have the town close by. With the shitty visas they never give us. At least you are together, in a great place. It's a prison. It drives you mad. What are your plans? What plans? - Like, for after the holidays. We're waiting for a reply from uni. We wait. - Together? Yes, of course. First, the degree, if it leads anywhere. We have no plan. To make money. You? What "plans" do you have? I don't know. It's so much pressure. By 20, they ask you to choose for your entire life. It sucks. At least they ask you there. I talked about this with some friends, before summer. We were saying that... no-one is happy about where they live. Some for more reasons than others. Jet! Have some water. - Why? It'll sweeten you up. I can't leave my mom and my brothers. You have brothers? Yes. Three, younger. - And you, Qe? One sister, Kindji. You? None. My parents work too much. You Jeta? I'm alone. My parents passed away. I'm sorry. - No worries. Pass me the water. You're lucky to be there. I don't know if it's luck. - It is. You're here, you're there. You can choose. Sometimes, it's best not to choose. You can't say that. Where are you going? - To get some air. Get inside. Take care of her. - What happened? I don't get your businesses, girls. Wash her... The rabbit, he ran away. I couldn't catch it. Don't worry. Put my shirt on. It'll give you strength. What are you reading? It's a French writer. What's it about? It's about the rise of a woman. Her brush with happiness and her descent into hell. I love this book. I've read it so many times. It's like I can feel what she went through. Like a painting melting in front of you. It sounds special. It is. What do you study in France? It was interesting at the hair salon. You three look happy. You're lucky. How can you know? I'm very lonely I've no-one to support me. - You're talking nonsense. I'm scared of the future. What's wrong? Have you taken something? You are carefree... living day by day, not thinking ahead. You're absolutely crazy. Why are you saying all this? And stop analysing us like animals. What's going on? - I can't stand this. Finally. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Come on, let's go. Drive! Come on, girls, don't have such down faces. We'll all get into uni. I hope so. It can't be any other way. I've been waiting for 2 years. They don't care if we rot here another year. No way. I don't want to end up a maid. Do you see us? - No. Wait, let me check. Excuse me. I don't see my name here. You haven't been selected. There must be a mistake. Could you check again? There's nothing. How? It's impossible that none of us have been selected. I'm telling you, there is nothing more, don't insist. "Don't insist"! Are you kidding? Nothing in two years! Now what? Calm down. - I'm not calming down, I want a chance. Enough! Or I'll kick you out forever. You already did but we have rights too! Listen, young lady, go home. No, I'm not leaving. We have rights too! - What rights? How? of course we have! - Go away now! What rights do you have? Go home! Move! We've rights too! - Shame on you! Have some. Help yourselves. - Yes, thank you very much. Pass me a light. Yes, right, exactly. His hand, his leg, he got hurt everywhere. Hairdresser, that's a good job. Look at my daughter, serving tea suits her so well. They're installing electricity much better, aren't they? Yes, finally. It's about time. What's Halim up to now? - Ah, Halim, Halim... It's not worth it. - It's time to shake things up. We need to see bigger. For our lives. We need to get out of here. No-one's gonna help us. We need to get a ton of cash. What if we started a gang? The Lionesses of the Hill. Look here, Zem's bitches. Who are you calling bitches? What's up, bitches? - Shut up! That little fucker has it good with you three. Shut up, we said! How much is a trick? Because me and my friend are interested. Where is Zem? - Why do you fucking care? Talk or I'll fuck you up. Where is he? Where is he I said? - Who are you? Fuck off, don't touch us. Don't touch us. Fuck off! - Get off me! Stop, let's go. And now, we're even. What the fuck? Did you see them almost raping us? Who were they? It's a money thing. It's alright. - Money? Qe, stop it. You can see he's hurt. He's causing us nothing but shit. Shut up or I'll hit you. Stop smothering him. Shut up! We have to go. Shut up. - I won't go anywhere. Speak instead of whimpering! He worked for them. I told him to stop but they couldn't accept. You got involved with an idiot. Who do you think we are? Are you ready for tomorrow? Totally. What if we run into him? No way. Tomorrow is our first big hit. Lionesses of the Hill Do I look good in this? This looks so good on me. Wonderful! Where did you buy them? Shit! It won't start. Fucking car. Tell me. How can one become a hero in this timeless era? I pronounce you... Princess of the Hill! Put your hands like this. Our young bride! Zem will love this one, my darling! Oh my God. - Seriously! Fuck. My sweetheart! How I've missed you. - Where were you? It's not much but it'll help. I'm not staying. What is this? Where's it from? - Qe! I'm talking to you, to you! Stop it! Calm down. Let her go. You feel better bringing money home? Get off me. - Look at me. Did you sell yourself? How can you say that? - Did you sell yourself? You're a whore. - I'm not a whore! You'll see what we do to whores here. Let me go! Stop! Don't touch me! Let her go! - Fuck off! I told you not to beat her. Stop! Get lost now! Get off me. There's no place for whores in my house! How is it? Beautiful isn't it? When are we leaving? Qe, why are you upset? Did you want it yellow? I don't know. We could have discussed it first, no? So what! We needed to change that other wreck. That isn't the question. I didn't know we had become billionaires and could afford a Jaguar. You're being too serious. Can't we have some fun? Yeah right, you're always the first when it comes to having fun. Fuck, Qe! You always have to spoil the mood! Don't you realize everyone will suspect us? What do we care what everyone thinks? That isn't the question. We have to be discreet. Now isn't the time to drop our guard! - I don't agree. We needed a new car. Girls, in the middle of nowhere, with a Jaguar! For real, stop screwing around! It rocks. A trip around the world? - Let's go. Get down! The police. They could arrest us. Where did that cute cop come from? Hi, Mr Officer. Is there a problem? - Our speed maybe? Forgive us, we will slow down. Fuck the fucking police! Be careful. We're famous. Even if they catch us they can't do anything to us. Because we are "The Lionesses of the Hill"! The whole world knows us. - What a life. The whole village has started gossiping. Now, we have to run. We could hide? You want to hide all your life? I'm heart-broken. Don't worry. We'll be OK. I give you my word. Come on, Zem! Cheers. Not bad! It's so nice! Where do we sleep? - In these two rooms. Which one is ours? - The biggest one. This one right? Shut up. Kiss me. Stop. Get up. - Where are your clothes? All over there. This? This is yours? - Yes. Come on. Good. - Bye. Move, move! It feels so good to get dressed up. We aren't used to it. We had nothing. We didn't know... And how many things we still don't know. I'll always come back. I will never, ever come back. We don't know what's out there for us. It scares me a bit. It has to be better than what's here. I'm going to leave and when I come back people will know. I don't know. We have the right to be happy in our home. What does that mean: "our home"? Careful with those. No, no. Don't put that on. Try this one. Let me see. Lips. Beautiful. To us! - To us! "A chance for all". This place is the best. - Yes. I used to come here with my dad as a kid... So many years ago. It's still as beautiful as how we left it. We brought breakfast! Did you sleep well? - Yes, a bit. "For Qe, the wild lioness I will never forget." You think they suspect us in the village? Of course not. Too many gangs are claiming it was them. Don't worry, they think they are boys. Come on, let's go home now. - No. I don't want to. - We have to. Another hour. Come on, we'll come back. - Stop, no! Let's go. Move it. In all of this... our only mistake... was coming back in this shit. Once you leave it behind... never go back to it. The police are all over the village! - What? What police? They're everywhere and it's your fault. - They followed you? They found our hideout! - Why blame us? - Do you hear them? Why the fuck! They're already here! You're crazy! Stop, Zem! Get off him! Stop, Stop! Because you can never be more in shit than when you choose to go back. What can we do about it? We still have a heart... a fucking heart... which ends up exploding.
