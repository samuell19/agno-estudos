Boris Giller presents Allison WHITBECK Vladimir MASHKOV in Karen SHAKHNAZAROV's film AMERICAN DAUGHTER Script - Alexander BORODYANSKY Karen SHAKHNAZAROV Directed by Karen SHAKHNAZAROV Director of Photography Vladimir SHEVTSIK Line Producer Henry ROSENTAL Producer Boris GILLER Here, eat... Have you found her? I have. She's a princess alright. What's this? See for yourself. Nice, eh? Think she's a schoolgirl? Sure. She' a schoolgirl like I'm a geisha. Must be a teacher, then. Man, would I like to squeeze her. - Here, lemme have another look. - Chill out, Arnold! - Look, there she is. - Right. So go on! What's the matter with you? - What's your problem? - I'm scared. - Scared? Of what? - What if she doesn't recognize me? Oh, c'mon! Not recognize her own father? - She was only 3 when she left. - Know what, Alex? Just go on! The guy's back. So what? She's your daughter, you're her father. Are you crazy or what? Can't Arnold, I just can't. Tomorrow. Four years have passed. How would I know what she's like now. Perhaps she's not the girl I knew... She may not remember me... may even hate me. I dunno if she's the same girl. Maybe you should see your ex-wife first. After what she did? I'll punch her lights out! Wrong, pal. Women have all kinds of rights in America. There's one here cut off her husband's cock. At night took it right off and threw out the window. Good thing the cops found it. Sewed it back on, thank God. Had it on TV a whole month. - A cock? On TV? - No, not the cock. The guy. And the place they found the cock. Now his wife's suing him for two mil! As if he drove her to it. So here, if it's a woman, you have to be very, very correct. You better see her husband. He's a big cheese in these parts. - I'll punch him out too! - Him? What for? He knew she'd run out on me and stolen my daughter. Maybe not. OK, maybe not. I've no reason to see him. I need to see Anyuta. Need to tell her. She needs to know. I'm sure she remembers me. - What? - Some woman keeps picking up. - Your ex? - No... Must be the help. - You call, ask for Anyuta. - What am I supposed to say? - That you're her classmate. - An eight year-old, eh? I don't speak English, see? Kill the cigarette, you'll cough. You old slut! - She hung up, the old hag. - Call her back. She'll get her. What? I don't understand. What are you saying? I can't understand. Can't you speak Russian? You forgot? Forgot everything? Remember how we lived? Remember our house, the swings... You loved the swings. Remember Granny? She's always talking about you. She's still alive, waiting for you! I'm your pa-pa, pa-pa. I have a mother, ma-ma. No, not your Mama, damn her. My ma-ma is your Granny. Yeah, your Granny. She's waiting for you. She sent you something. From Granny. No, not "babushka". "kukla", doll. See, her eyes close. A doll... She's asleep. Asleep. Mother, father, granny, sleep, vodka... That's right, vodka. You remember your Russian! Hair. Hair. Hi. Hi. Looking good. Thanks. Let's meet later tonight. We have lots to talk about, don't we? I think so. - Where are you staying? - At Arnold's. Remember him? You mean that drunk you played with at the bar? - What, he lives here? - Right here in San Francisco. Call me at three. Tell Anne to come with me now, will you? Go with Mama, Anyuta. She asked, are you coming tomorrow? Sure. Goodbye, Anyuta. My husband David. - This is your first time here? - Yes. - How do you like it? - I like it. What will you have for a drink? Vodka? Scotch. A little something for you. - What is this? - Open it. You're a size 50, right? I've put on weight since then. I'd be tight fit. What will you have? Nothing. Sorry, I've no time, let's talk business. What are your plans for Anne? I want to take her home with me. Out of the question. - And why is that, sugar? - 'Cause I won't give her up. By the way, I'm not asking, I've a court order which says I have custody. I couldn't care less about any orders of your court. - I wasn't there. - Of course you weren't. You stole my daughter and ran off. I'd advise you to choose your words. This is America, not your godforsaken CIS. They have laws here. If the laws here let whores kidnap children I don't give a damn about them. - You'll eat those words... - Don't start threatening me! Don't touch me! The matter is he's an S.O.B. What'd he say? You want more money? - So did you talk? - We talked. Take me to their place. I need to see Anyuta. Show him your passport. What did he say? - What did he say? - You can't see Anne. What? I can't see my daughter? That bitch called the cops? My daughter's here! You have a daughter? Come on, let's go. Please, let's go away. Daddy! Anyuta! - What did she say? - She said: "I've come to you". You ran away from home? You want to live with me? She wants to go to Russia, to see her grandmother. What did she say? She wants the two of you to go to Mexico first. Yeah, right. Here we'll be picked up at the airport. Aleksei, we need to take her home. Of course. Alex, come here. Listen, this is no joke. You could land in jail for this. What are you, nuts? Listen, I'm really grateful to you. Get us outa here. If you can't, we won't hold it against you. You know, Aleksei, I could get in big trouble. I understand. Here's where you get on the bus to Phoenix from there it's a stone's throw to Mexico. Thanks, Arno. - Well, I'll be going... - OK. Good luck. I don't understand. You mean money? It's all I have. Where are you going? Whatcha want, kid? Anyuta, it's you? Thanks. Me? I don't understand. Me? A haircut? A car? Drive a car? Profession? My profession? My profession, right? I'm a singer. And I play the guitar. In a big ensemble. Many people there. Remember Mistradov? He's a drummer. And I'm a guitarist. In a big orchestra. Remember I lost you? You and I we went to the zoo. You were a little girl then. You and I went to the zoo. Zoo with animals. Animals. An elephant with a trunk and big ears. Yeah, elephant. Who else? Monkey, monkey... Monkey. Remember, at the zoo? Also penguins. You remember the penguins? Remember I went... to buy some beer. And you went to see the camels. A camel's... with a lip... and a hump. So you went to see the camels... I had my beer and when I returned... you had already left... I couldn't find you. Where are you, Anya? Remember? Know what's the Russian for this? Nose. Nose, Pinocchio! And this is... ears... Ears... And this here is... Lips. And this is... And this is... Hair. And this is... Hands. And this is legs. Legs. And what is this? How? A finger. I see... I... I'm walking. Walking. Now I jump... I... I dance... I run... Sand... How? Sand... And all this is... Ocean! I swim!.. How? I swim! And up there is... How? Sky! Sky! And all this... around us... The Earth! The round Earth! Under my feet... Where I'm standing. The birds... Look!.. A seagull! How? Look... A jellyfish... And that is... A house... What else... The mist... When you can't see anything... Phoenix? I thought Phoenix's be different. What did she say? What did she say? Isn't this Phoenix? Not the one we want. Once we marked a stone quarry. But I reckoned: no bump off for me. I told my pal as much. A Georgian man, our gander... He kipped and loused it up. A harness bull whacked him out. Anyuta! Anyuta... You know what. We need to give him some money. Maybe I give him some money? What for? So he'll let us go. He won't take money. Our policemen don't take money. That depends on how much you give him. Maybe he won't take 20 bucks but he may take a hundred. Don't! I gotta talk to the chief. Bring your boss here. Thanks. Go, Brian. I need to have a word with him. There's a hundred here. That's all I have, I swear. Listen, pal, just let us go, OK? What about him? I'll be damned... Rain... The train? A song? About the train? I don't remember... Fog? What is "fog"? Ah, fog! Fog... Train... fog... A lilac-colored fog Flows over our heads... A midnight star Burns high above the train. The conductor lingers, because he knows Because I'm saying farewell to my girl... This one? You look in my eyes Squeezing my hand I'm leaving for one year, or maybe even two... Or maybe you're losing your friend Forever, forever, Now the bell will ring, and I'll be off... Daddy, you and Mommy, could you maybe live together again? Probably not. You won't live together... Anyuta, are you ill? You hear me, Anya? - Hi. - Hi. - How's Anyuta? - She's fine now. - Is she well? - Yes. Everything's fine. Thank God. Why are you staring at me? Never thought I'd see you in an American prison. Now you have. You like how I look? Come on. Do you know what term you are in for? That's no concern of yours. Why did you come? Surely not to look at me up. Aleksei, hear me out. Calmly. OK? You're facing 4 years in prison. But David and I could arrange it, so you could go home, to Russia. And what do you want in exchange? This was drawn up by a lawyer... If you sign it, you renounce your rights as her father. You mean if I sign it they'll let me go? First thing tomorrow. You're proposing a deal? Yes, that's right. You're proposing I renounce my daughter? I don't like your deal. - You know something? - What? Can you tell Anyuta something for me? Depends on what you say. Tell her I love her. Fine. I'll tell her. Listen, Alex, when I get outa here, I'll come to Russia to see ya. Anyuta!
