He is the guy who told me that no one runs from retrieve. The guy had been here before. I thought you were a standalone guy. What you worried about this con for? ( Scoffs ) I'm not worried about this con. I'm just trying to figure things out, you know, learn. Learn two things: You fuck up, you answer to captain brown. You run, them dogs will eat your ass.

Yeah, I'll try, but it's been like second nature for me now... "Mon." So, uh, find anything yet? We sure do have more than our fair share of runners for such a high-security prison, you know what I mean, but, uh, there's nothing I can really put my finger on yet.

Lay down two sets of tracks, split, cross over. Couple of dogs follow Willy here. Couple of other dogs follow you. Why? I don't get it. Well, sometimes we have two or more cons who are stupid enough to think that they can reach that fence, and we gotta train them dogs. Now, is there anything else? Yeah, I heard the dogs again last... I want you to keep your eye on the track. Willy here, he's got the route map. You don't have to worry about anything else. Two for the gate. Okay. ( Barking ) ( Men panting ) Hi, Hank. You know, this road is not on this map, you know? Hey, neither is that shack. Oh, man, don't tell me we're lost. Well, you know what? I bet you we make a wrong turn at that downed tree, remember? I thought you told me you never broke track, you never got lost. "Taylor, mon, I always know exactly who and where I am." Yeah, well, there's a first time for everything, all right? Yeah, well, let's get the hell outta here. Wait, wait, wait. Let's go check it out. Why? Knowledge is a powerful thing, mon. Yeah, well, we'd better get back on track. Hey, Julian, stop. J.! J., j., j., j.! Look, we have time, mon. The dogs have just get let go right now. We have all the time in the world. What the hell is going on here, Willy? Going on? I just asked you for a little help, man. Friends help friends, right? We're not friends, man. We're just two cons running track. That's not the way I see it, mon. What do you want me to do? All right, help me up the tree. Why? Uh... I'm gonna go tree to tree, right, get near the shack, come back same place. The dogs can't track me. So, you coming along? What is this, fucking Tarzan and Jane? No, I'm not coming. I'll get you up the tree, and then I'm running my track, all right? All right, Taylor, mon, that's very friendly. Hey, tell me something.

Escaped convict Jake Henry has been apprehended and has confessed to the murder. A graduate of the Australian school of music, miss brown was known for her sensitive interpretations of the organ music of j.S. Bach. Friends and colleagues are in shock over the senseless tragedy which has cut short a brilliant and promising career. Another fatality at the scene of the crime was Laura's faithful dog, who was slain, it is thought, while attempting to protect her. Now, before an update on the weather, we go over...

No. Well, look again! Look! Just look... look, see! Ah, see? Captain brown likes to test a man, run him near the fence and see if he makes a break for it. Now, you see that? He puts that guard out there. He shoots you in the ass, and you'll be leaving here for good, feet first. What do you care for, anyway, man? You're my friend, mon! You helped me up that tree!

We don't know yet, sir. This dogboy's supposed to be in bed. He ain't meant to be in here. We don't know why he got into Clyde's cage, sir. That dog is supposed to be secured before a man enters his cage. Yes, sir, the dogboy knew that, sir. I want your report on my desk by noon. Yes, sir. What the hell are you doing, Taylor? Nothing, boss. I just going to help my friend. Your friend is going straight to the morgue, and you are staying right here and cleaning up your friend's mess. Right, now, let's break it up! Pappy, you come with me. Yes, boss. All right, guys, hit the sack. You heard the man, dogboy. Start scrubbing. ( Buzzer ) Oh... yes? Deputy district attorney dern is here. Oh, yeah. All right. Ahem. Adam Wakefield, Mr. Dern. I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. Actually, it's Ms. Dern, warden. Mr. Ewing is my assistant. Oh! ( Laughs ) Right. You know, I assumed... Yeah, I'm sorry. I do apologize, miss dern, though I have to admit, you about the best-looking d.A. I've seen out here, and I've seen most of them. Thank you. Cigarette? So, you must be new on the team, dern. Dern... Was your father senator dern? Yes, sir. Oh! I voted for him. He was a good man. So, tell me, what brings you out to retrieve? The prisoner death in the dog unit last night. Well, you've got some pretty good sources. We haven't put that out yet. Of course, we don't know what we got yet. A dog handler was killed in one of the cages. Thing is, we don't know what he was doing in there. He should've been in bed. The name of the prisoner was Owens, wilbur b., known as Willy b. That's right. He was one of ours. One of yours? Uh, what are you saying? Owens, wilbur b., is... was, really... detective William mccarver on special assignment to my office. You put someone undercover in my prison? Operation backtrack. We're working closely with a number of federal agencies. I don't give a damn if you're working with Jesus Christ. I run this prison, and you will goddamn well have the professional courtesy to inform me when you put a man in here! Detective mccarver was investigating one of your senior guards, sir. We didn't want to risk informing anyone in the prison structure. Oh, ho, I know what that means lady. That means you don't know whether I'm doing whatever he's doing, whoever he is. Eh, well, would you be kind enough to tell me just who you're investigating on my staff? Captain Robert brown. Cap... uh, cap brown? What'd he do, break a leash law? Treasury and DEA have been running an operation monitoring money laundering through offshore banks in the Cayman Islands. They picked up brown by chance on a phone intercept and traced it back. Seemed he's made deposits totaling 960,000 in the past few years... not bad for a guy making 60 a year with o.T. Well, that's a feather in your cap, isn't it, if it's true. We're treating this like a murder, unless there's strong evidence to the contrary. You got a dead cop, and I sympathize with that, but the report says that he failed to secure a cage and a dog got loose. Now, he was someplace he wasn't supposed to be. If you had come to me in the first place, then maybe his death could've been avoided! Now, obviously, I will treat this seriously, ma'am, but any investigation at retrieve is gonna run through my office! I understand. We will coordinate everything through you. Fair enough. But I don't want anyone else knowing about this investigation. Thank you for your time, warden. Miss dern! I don't want a dirty guard in my prison anymore than you do. If brown's head has to roll, I'll deliver it on a silver platter. All right, on your feet! On your feet for cap brown now! Okay, strip search. Into the washroom. Stark bollock naked. Don't be embarrassed, boys. Y'all been jerking them together, anyway. Move! Make it thorough, Mr. Walsh, understand? Very good, sir. On the double! Take the place apart, Mr. Wilkins. What we looking for, cap? I'll know it when I see it. No contraband, sir. Get me Taylor. Taylor! Captain brown, front and center! On the double! You and Willy b. Were getting tight. I guess. ( Chuckles ) You guess. You been any closer, you'd be planning a family. I've been running cons a long time, son. I know how it goes. Ain't no con can keep a secret when he's got a buddy. Prison's too hard without sharing. What was Willy doing in the kennels? I don't know. I was asleep. He didn't tell me. Where's Willy b.'S stash? What stash? Bullshit, son, you are really starting to piss me off. Every one of you's got a stash... Little bit of weed, a shank, a picture of some bitch. He didn't tell me. You know what you are, Taylor? You're one of those half-smart boys who thinks he knows how it works. You know what happens to them? My dogs run 'em down, and I shoot 'em off the fence. What have you found out about your dogboy's death? Nothing yet. Do you see this causing any problems? Problems? What kind of problems? He ain't the first con that's died because he was in the wrong place doing the wrong thing. He was a cop. ( Phone ringing ) Ewing. Who is it? It's that dern bitch. Y-Yeah, but Wakefield could be right, Jennifer. The guy was in a cage with a wild dog. It could've been an accident. Will mccarver was too smart to make that sort of mistake. Now, the last thing will told me was that there was this new dogboy that he thought he could trust. Don't shine a light on him. If they kill mccarver, they'll be looking for his friends. You think I haven't already thought about that? What I'm gonna need are prison records on the dog unit going back five years, but don't ask Wakefield for them. Find another source. How am I supposed to do that. Get arrested. So, what did she say? ( Chuckles ) Well, she said... get arrested. Warden Wakefield, I'd like to apologize for the way I've gone about this investigation. It was arrogant and wrong of me to insert an agent here without first consulting you. I hope you'll forgive me and allow me to continue my work here. Oh, thank you! That's very handsome. Do, do sit down. But, miss dern, I don't know how you can handle this matter any better than I can. Well, maybe I can't, warden, but will mccarver was my partner. You were a cop. You know what that means. I have to try. Where would you like to start? Well, I'd like to talk to the men in the dog unit, and then have a word with captain brown. ( Chuckles ) Sure. We can do that for you right here and now. Be my guest. She can interrogate me anytime. Great personality. ( Laughing ) Inside, Taylor. Mr. Taylor, deputy district attorney Jennifer dern. Please. Says here you've only been in a couple of months. How do you like working the animal unit? I'm in prison, lady. "Like" isn't a real big part of it. I just do what I'm told. Willy b. Said he could trust you. His real name was William mccarver. He was an undercover agent working for my office. We believe captain brown is doing something illegal in this prison and will, Willy b., was investigating it. Where are you going? Look, I don't want to know any more. I don't want to hear any more. Someone like you comes in here and starts talking to someone like me, I'll be dead in a week. I need your help to find out what happened to will. ( Scoffs ) Good luck. ( Sighs ) That's the last one, ma'am. Can I escort you to your car? Uh, thanks, no. I have an appointment with captain brown. Do you know where he is? I believe he has a v.I.P. Day. A v.I.P. Day? Yes, ma'am. Every now and again they like to come down and ride along. Captain says it's good for the program. What program is that? The dogboy program. Captain brown will tell you all about it. Show me the way. ( Grunting ) You think I'd forget, huh? You think I'd do nothing? Ain't how it works, dogboy! Gah! Your friend Willy b.'S dog meat. Maybe it's time you feed the dogs too, huh? God. Don't do it. You do it, you spend the rest of your life in here. He ain't worth it. Come on, boy. Put it down. You kill him, he's gonna take your life with him. ( Weight clatters ) All right, you two! Get him over to the infirmary! Hey, top dog, you come with me. I got a job for you. We appreciate your support, senator, and here's to you. ( Knocking ) I'll tell you right now, it's getting harder and harder to come by. What the hell's this, pappy? Where's my top dog? Well, he, uh, he injured himself. I sent him to the infirmary, but I tell you, boss, Taylor here, he'll run as good a track as Miguel. Well, if he doesn't, it's on your head. Gentlemen, this here's our top dog today. He's gonna lay the tracks we're gonna run. Don't look like much. Well, it's not the looking, Mr. Cates, it's the doing. This boy can run. Just don't want to waste my time with some gutless punk gives it up before the dogs get near him. What you in for, boy? Kicking the shit out of a big old redneck. If was running this place, I'd stretch you down and work the piss out of you with a bullwhip. Then you'd be in on assault charges, too, Mr. Cates. Well, as I live and breathe. How nice to see you again, miss dern. You know warden Wakefield. Gentlemen, this is Jennifer dern from the d.A.'S office. She's been investigating an unfortunate accident we had down at the dog unit. You know, she's been... let me see, now. It was St. Luke's fundraiser, wasn't it? You have quite a memory, Mr. Diggs. Yes, ma'am. How's your wife? Why, she's just fine. She's just as fine as frog's hair. One big, happy family. Mm. I understand you're running an exercise today. I'd like to ride along. Oh, well, I don't know. That's kind of an unusual request. Any more unusual than for these gentlemen? Well, I think miss dern would be a welcome addition to our party. You betcha. Excuse me, warden, but there's gonna be some hard riding. I doubt miss dern will be up to it. Well, I was raised on a ranch, captain brown. Don't worry about me. Well, now! It's all settled, then, isn't it? I suppose it is. ( Barking ) Looks like our query's gone to earth, gentlemen. Down the hatch! Goddamn, it doesn't get much better than this. Got a mighty fine pack of dogs here, captain brown. Maybe he's not in there. That pipe could go on for miles! Oh, he's in there, all right. Check it out, Mr. Wilkins. You in there, dogboy? Fair game. You got me. Just call the dogs off, and I'll come on out. Shall I call them off, captain? There's only one man gives orders around here, Mr. Wilkins, and it's not that scum in the pipe! You're to come on out! That's an order from cap brown, you hear? What's Clyde doing there? What is it? Manhole! What do you see? I don't know. It's pretty dark down there. Wait a minute! There's a glimmer of light to the left. Well, that figures. What else? Nothing else! Yes! For Christ's sake, what is it? It's a metal grille, and I guess that means... He's trapped. ( Chuckles ) Why don't you send Clyde down after him? Teddy, we'll smoke the critter out. ( Crackling ) He's trapped. Clyde'll take care of him. All right, warden, you've found your man. You've had your fun. I think it's time we call it a day. I really should be getting back to town. Well, it's all a matter of discipline, miss dern, but if you want to go back, you just follow the river due south. We're just keeping up an old tradition here, smoking old foxy out of his hole. Well, it's also tradition that the fox is always killed and the youngest hunter blooded. Is that what you have in mind? Because I don't want blood on my hands, warden. That won't happen. That boy's gonna come to no harm. Now, come along, now. Don't be an old spoil sport. ( Julian coughing ) ( Barking ) Aah! Aah! Get off! Call him off! Aah! Warden! All right, Bob, that's enough. She's getting all high in the behind here! Damn it. Whoa. Hold on, miss. ( Fires ) Call him off, or I'll kill him! Release! ( Groans, coughs ) You'd shoot my dog? To save a man's life, yes. And for your information, I'm filing a full report of this incident to the district attorney first thing tomorrow morning. Captain brown, why don't you head on in with the dogs and show our guests a little hospitality? I'll, uh, I'll take care of things here. Thanks for speaking up. You're welcome. Miss dern? You, uh, remount, we'll head on in. You all right, son? Yes, sir. ( Dogs barking ) ( Knocking ) You're working late. Something's going on at retrieve, something bad. I'm getting out a report on it for the d.A. Make your hair stand on end. Can I get you a cup of coffee or something? No. Oh, hey. Come take a look at this. What is it? Where'd you get it? Dogboy named Taylor gave it to me. Snuck it to me on the sly, actually. Taylor? Wasn't he the one that will wanted... Yeah, he seems cool. It's a picture of a man with his hands up. Looks kind of funny. Did you ask him? I didn't get a chance, but I will first thing tomorrow. I really think we've got something. Well, it's curious, but it wouldn't put too much importance on it. It's a chewed-up photo. It's gotta be the key. What do you want? Please, sit down. Tell me about the picture. What about it? It's okay. Did you find it on will? Sort of. It was in the cage where he was killed. Now, I gave you that picture, lady, what the hell more do you want from me? But where did it come from? What does it mean? You had a cop in here, and he got killed. What the hell do you think they're gonna do to me if they think I'm part of it? If who thinks? I don't want to have anything else to do with this. No. Wait. Please. Will was my friend. He said he could trust you. I don't know what you're talking about, lady, and I can't help you. ( Indistinct singing ) Taylor, need a word with you. Hey! You're running in an hour. Who's riding? Me and Wilkins. Where's captain brown? I don't know and I don't care and neither should you. I got orders to set your track and run it with Wilkins. You got orders to run the track. I don't know why the hell you should care where cap brown is. I don't know when the hell you're gonna learn to keep that mind of yours to yourself! Jesus. He's really got your ass tied up, doesn't he? Captain brown's got everybody's ass tied up. There ain't no shame in being afraid of cap brown. He is a frightening man. You be on time. So, did you get anything from your dogboy? Attitude. What'd you get? Oh, you owe me. Retrieve's prisoner database over the last five years. Inmate files and photos, too. I had to practically promise marriage to that 300-pound clerk in records. What, the pretty one with the nose ring? That's her. Ooh. I'll get the office to spring for a bridal shower. Hey, by the way, thanks for coming in on the weekend. That's all right. I had some work to catch up on anyway. Management out now, pappy. Let's get going. I'll be right with you, boss. Hold on, boys. Wilkins, take the afternoon off. Pappy's going out with me and Clyde. Yes, sir, captain. Come on, pappy. Let's go track US a dogboy. When he says go, you go hot. Go on, and keep on going. Uhh! What? Oh. Come on. Oh... Good boy, Clyde. Chased him up a tree. What's he doing in this area, pappy? Doesn't he know that we don't run the northwest? Yes, sir, boss. He knows. He does? Why, did you tell him, pappy? I tell them all. I told this one right off. You don't run there. He must be lost. Then let's find him, Clyde. Track! Holy shit. ( Barking ) You screwed up, boy. You broke track. Disobedience will bring you pain. Time to pay the Piper. Boss, don't do it. Pappy, what do you think I'm gonna do? You think I'm gonna shoot this dogboy? I don't know, boss. ( Chuckles ) And what are you gonna do? Are you gonna shoot me, pappy? Boss, too many people have died already. You said it was gonna stop. People? You call them people? Scum, pappy, that's what they are. That's why you had to pull the pin on Willy. The world's a better place without scum. You said it was gonna stop. It is gonna stop, and there isn't gonna be any shooting, is there, pappy, but what are we gonna do about this here dogboy? Shoot him, pappy, shoot him! For Christ's sake, what's going on, pappy? You gonna take orders from a dogboy? I-I don't know what I'm gonna do. Boss, maybe it's best you put that gun down. What do you think, Clyde? ( Barks ) No, boss! Jesus! Dumb shit. You are definitely fucking up my little world, Tyler, and I don't like it. I finished up. I'm gonna go. Hey, come in here for a minute. Did you find something? Yeah, check this out. I found this guy. His name's Walker. He was killed trying to escape. Really? Did you find anything else? Six out of eight attempted escapees in the past year have ended up dead. Is there a common factor? None of the dead ones have any next of kin, nobody to ask questions. What does that have to do with brown? It could be a coincidence. Everything that goes on in that prison has something to do with brown. What does any of this have to do with tax evasion? Stay focused on the big picture, here, Jen. The big picture?! I swear, ewing, if I hadn't been there on that ride-along, they would've killed Taylor. You weren't there. This guy's a psychopath! I have to go. I'll, uh, see you Monday. Oh, my god. They're hunting them. Glad you could make it on such short notice. Hell, I'd drop anything to hunt. Hell, I'd drop anything to hunt. You got 15 minutes. I've given him 15 minutes. Let's make it ten. ( Panting ) Track! Okay, let's have a look at the cards now! Oh, oh ho! Dawn, I'm afraid you lose. It's your turn. She's the first one, first one gonna show US... Oh ho! Yeah! Brrrr! Warden! We've gotta get to the dog unit right now. Um! Well, now, hold on. Just let me call down there, see what's happening. Ahem. Yeah, this... this is the warden. Give me a situation report, and make it real quick. Who's dealing? Cheers! Dealing to the left? Okay! Yeah. Yeah, right. There's no reason to go over there. We got one man in the infirmary, we got two working chores, and we got one running a track with captain brown over in the northwest quadrant. Who's running the track? Taylor. He fits the profile. No next of kin, nobody to look for him. We've gotta find that boy before they kill him, warden. Kill him? What the hell are you talking about? I'll tell you on the way. Yeah, well, just keep playing, girls. I want to see, uh, want to see a loser when I get back. You can't tell a damn thing from that photo. It could mean anything! Well, how is it that a third of the men who try to escape die, and when the ratio of killing went up, brown began depositing money in offshore banks? Damn it! My battery's dead. Can I borrow yours? Doesn't work. I've been meaning to have it fixed. What? Goddamn it, I told you it doesn't work! Oh, my god! ( Grunting ) ( Screaming ) ( Spraying ) Aah! Aah! You bitch! You bitch! ( Panting, coughing) ( Footsteps ) Uhh! Oh! What the hell are you doing here? I was looking for you! I know what's going on. They're hunting people out here like animals. Well, gee, now we both know. Wakefield's in on it, too. I just got away from him. Shit. ( Dog barking ) Okay, we gotta get over the fence. It's our only chance. The closest one is northwest. Let's go! You're being hunted, now, too. Ow! You okay? Yeah. What the hell are you carrying in your hand, anyway? Mace. How do you think they'll like our scent now? They're gonna love it. Come on! ( Whining ) What in the hell's Going on now? Ack! He's got company, female company. Oh, yeah? And who the hell do you think he's eloping with, that nurse? Had to guess, I'd say it was that dern bitch. Am I hearing you right? She's been hanging around like a bad smell. Well, now, cap, we're in deep shit. I'm outta here. Hey, quit worrying. You get two for the price of one. You'll owe me. Well, that dumb dog of yours is gonna need a firecracker up his ass. And who's gonna light the fuse, you? Come on. Clyde's picked up the trail again. Let's go. Come on! You're gonna stick by me when we're out of this? Hey, you're my only witness. Yeah, but are they gonna believe me, a con, going against state senators and all? A con and a senator's daughter. You're a senator's daughter? There it is. Yeah, come on. There's no way I'm gonna make it over that. You go ahead. No, no way! Come on, we'll make it together. Come on! Uhh! Come on! Come on! ( Barking ) You hear that? He's saying we're getting close. Well, this is one hell of a lousy deal, cap. The birds have flown, and not even a single lousy potshot. No one's ever made the wire before. Well, I guess I'd better get my money back before we have company. ( Chuckles ) My whole world's fallen apart. You want your money back? Don't fuck with me, bro. I got too much on you. You arrogant prick. You're in this as deep as I am. You're gonna help me out, or you're going down with me. Oh. And who are they gonna believe, a respected pillar of society, or a fucked-up cop with a reputation for killing cons? Oh, you might've got away with it back in Australia, just. Here, you won't be so lucky, I guarantee. Here, you won't be so lucky, I guarantee. Okay, Clyde, let's go get our meal ticket. You and me are going on a long vacation. You and me are going on a long vacation. Now who's tracking who, boss? This what you're looking for, captain? You should've gone over the fence when you had the chance, dogboy. Oh, no, no, no, no. I wanna be here when they drive you back from diagnostic. Some boys in the tank are gonna be real interested seeing you come in. Stand up. Put your hands behind your back. Uhh! Now, you drop that, or I'll break her neck. Let her go. Stop it, you stupid bitch. I'll kill her, Taylor, I mean it. All right, all right. Calm down. Now, slide it over here. Now, turn around and put your hands behind your head. Uhh! Leave it right there, brown. What the hell are you doing, Adam? Why don't you just, uh, keep the little lady company? Why don't you just, uh, keep the little lady company? Well... You didn't tell me you were keeping records. It was insurance for both of US. Insurance, my ass. You were gonna take off with these, and then what, blackmail US good citizens from some safe haven? Well, that could work for me, too. Kill. What? I said kill! Aah! Back off! You shot my dog. ( Screams ) Over there. You can be part of Clyde's funeral pyre. You can be part of Clyde's funeral pyre. ( Grunting, banging ) It's locked! Grab Wakefield's gun! Okay, move! I'm gonna blast the lock! ( Rifle discharges ) ( Neighs ) Uhh! ( Barking ) God! You all right? Yes! Here. Shit! No keys. They must still be on the warden. Don't even think about it! If he makes it to the fence, he's gone! Yeah, ewing, it's me. I'm at retrieve. I'm in the northwest quadrant with Taylor. I need backup now! We got a man down and a fire. Got it, boys, huh? Got the scent? Track! Track! Taylor! Shit. Ha! Ow! Ha! Aah! Get off! Go! Get off me! Down! Ha! ( Screaming ) Release! Release! Are you all right? Yeah. So, you think you can get me off? For good behavior? ( Siren wailing ) ( Laughs ) You know... Hey, what are friends for?
