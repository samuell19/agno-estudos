To make his dream come true, he spends his time trying to escape from an early age. Was it a fiction? I don't know, it doesn't matter. And then ? But every time he runs away, his family finds him very quickly. He has run away so many times that his family starts to think he is crazy. And, when he's 18, they send him to the asylum. And after ? What is happening ? Happy ending? Does he go back to his family and live happily ever after? False! Then he escapes from the asylum. We don't see him again for the rest of the film. At the end, it suddenly comes back. He stole money from his parents, jump in a cab, and said to the driver: " It is all I have… Take me anywhere when there is no more money, Let me get off somewhere. ” Do you know your mom is worried about you? I know. Shouldn't you think about it a bit more? I've made my decision. It won't be easy if you change your mind later. You are the one leaving, not me. We want you to go with us, it was you who refused. Why should I go? It's my home here. Home is where your family is. You understand ? I only feel at home in one place, and it's here. Here, the situation is getting worse, why wait to leave? Why not try to fix the problems? Because emigrating to Canada is not a solution? No, running away from problems doesn't make them go away. Fleeing is also a solution. If your grandfather hadn't run away here to Hong Kong the whole family would be starving, and you wouldn't even be there. I am not a grandfather, I am me. Let me ask you a question. Imagine you crave a banana. You walk into a store, but there are only apples and pears. What are you doing ? Aren't you going to another store? This metaphor is wrong, I am the owner of the store. Why would I go elsewhere? If your residence is poorly managed, then you complain that it is not secure, and the manager answers you: “don't you feel safe? go away ! " - Would you go? - Wrong! You are not the owner, just a resident in this apartment. Likewise, you will never be the owner of this city. You just live here. You are a resident. If we are not the owners, then who? If you were really the masters here, you wouldn't have gone to sleep on the streets. We did it precisely to show that this city is our home. And after ? You occupied Central for 3 months. Did you see where we went earlier? There is nothing more, not the slightest trace. As if nothing had happened. What is your point ? You are innocent, that's good. But do you understand? You can't change the world. You can only change yourself. I did not do anything wrong ! Why should I change? If something isn't right, why wouldn't we dare to change it? How old are you ? You don't make a living, you can't achieve anything on your own, but you want to change the world? Don't overestimate yourself. You slept in the street to change the world, while deep down, you are only looking for the feeling of existing. Why should I make money first and foremost? And you ? How old are you ? Besides making money, what have you done for this world? I am only a doctor. If anyone is sick, I treat them. As for the problems of this world, I do not know what to do, and it is not my role. This is the difference between us. You think that if you have health, you can dispense with principles or faith. In this society, people think they can sacrifice everything for money. Why should everyone agree with you? Some believe in Jesus, in Buddha, others in the Law, in Money. Our faith is different. "Faith"? Do you dare to talk to me about "faith" when you don't know how to distinguish between Good and Evil? If we could tell for sure what is right and wrong, we wouldn't need to believe. There are some things to be left to God's judgment. You claim to be tolerant, while you are selfish. You are arrogant, but you think you are humble. It's people like you who make the world bad. What is this attitude? Why didn't you put on a coat when you went out? I didn't think it would be so cold. Don't worry, it will be fine. It's flu season right now. ♪ have more than 10 patients in the hospital today. Take care of yourself. I have never seen anyone change the world by being sick. The day after tomorrow is the anniversary of grandfather's death? Who. Do you remember? ♪ have a soccer game, I won't be able to free myself. It is not serious. Your mother and I are going to go. Tell grandfather for me that I managed to enter the University. Of course. ♪ dreamed about him last month. What do you mean ? It was dark, and he was taking the streetcar home after work. Like when he was still there. The tram. I saw him come down from our house. I called him, but he couldn't hear me. I ran down, but he was no longer there. Now, every time I see the tram, I always wonder... If I don't go and see Grandpa get off. Uncle Tsang, is that you? Who ? Is it really you? We know each other ? What? You the famous King of Kowloon, everyone knows you! But I thought you were dead? Well, just because I'm dead, wouldn't I be allowed to come here? Of course yes ! Welcome ! What brings you here tonight? I am the King. I have to inspect my kingdom from time to time. And where do you want to inspect today? - Let's go to Kowloon. - OK, I'll take you. Uncle Tsang, would you mind doing some calligraphy for me? Why is that ? You are a renowned artist now. Your calligraphy is worth a fortune. If you make one for me, I could sell it and buy myself an apartment. Before I died, I wrote all over the street. The police would stop me and erase my calligraphy. Everyone said I was nuts. But after my death, they put my calligraphy in galleries, exhibitions abroad. They said that I was an “artist”, that my calligraphy was a cultural heritage, an exceptional artistic achievement. Ridiculous, right? It's true, but people only care about the dead. Many artists did not become famous until after their deaths. Who was this guy who liked to paint already... Van Gogh ! It was him, wasn't it? My calligraphy is linked to my land. But they uprooted my work to put it on display, they tore my calligraphy from my land. Does it still make sense? There used to be the Kowloon Citadel there. As a child, I had a friend who lived within the walls. ♪ often went to play with him. The buildings there never saw the sun, it was very humid. People from the outside got confused easily. In the end the government razed the whole town and built a large and bright Kowloon Citadel Park to commemorate the Old Town. It's also the fate of your works, isn't it? They can't erase all of my calligraphy. I continue to write more beautifully. And we'll see who's faster from them or me. We will see. ♪ I wrote more than once in these streets, on walls, doors, lampposts, electrical cabinets, garbage cans… I wrote everywhere! Do you write the same thing every time? Of course not. I sometimes write the names and titles of my ancestors. Sometimes the land I own. Sometimes I denounce the crimes of the government that took over my land. ♪ would like to know my family tree too. Maybe my ancestors were also the masters somewhere. Maybe I was a king too. However, I wouldn't take it as seriously as you do. ♪ always wanted to ask you, do you really think you are the king of kowloon? Or are you playing the fool to advertise yourself? It's in my lineage, from the Zhou dynasty. By imperial decree, our family, Tsang, received the land of Kowloon at Sau Mau Ping. My ancestor Tsang Kwong Ching was the premier of the Zhou Dynasty. Her son, Tsang Chiu Fung, married Princess Zhou. I was born in the 13th year of Emperor Qing Pu Yi's reign, or as you say, in 1921. I am the 35th heir of the Tsang family, and I inherited my family's land in Kowloon. That's why I was born with the title of "King of Kowloon". Uncle Tsang, forgive me what I'm going to say will probably sound a little harsh to you. What dynasty is it now? The Zhou dynasty? Or the Qing dynasty? After the Japanese occupation and British colonization how can there still be a king? Japanese occupation, British colonization... I do not recognize these times! It's your story, not mine. Your story is written in the books. Mine is written on the walls! Naivety is good. But do you understand? Even though your ancestors really owned this land, a lot has happened since. You can't change reality, and neither can you change history. Your story is the law of the jungle, the legend of the victors. It is full of wars and conspiracies. If the British had not occupied my land, history would not have been rewritten. I will always be the King of Kowloon. And you, you would be my subjects. So be the king in your own world. But in our world, you are just a bum. Stop living in your fantasies. Besides, even without the British, how could you govern such a large and populous territory? You might as well let the Hong Kong government take care of it. What a tissue of absurdity! So if I'm unhappy with the Hong Kong government, I just have to fire them and lock them up in Stanley Prison? Yes of course ! You are the King of Kowloon, right? Look, there's a wall over there. I'll drop you off. And you'll write an Imperial Order on the wall, saying you disapprove of the government, and want to fire them. What do you say about that? ♪ forgot to bring my brush. The next time. I'm joking. Do you really think that if you were the king you would have needed to write it on every street corner? ♪ wrote all over the streets to tell people That I am the King of Kowloon. For years you have been writing all over Kowloon, Hong Kong Island and the New Territories. But look, there's nothing left today. No more trace of your calligraphy. What is the meaning of all this? You hurt me, you know? You all live in... In a huge illusion. You don't see the past or the future. You pass through this world like shadows, pitifully snatching a few moments of insipid existence. And you ? You wrote everywhere declaring your sovereignty. But in my opinion, you are just a patient who tries to convince himself that he exists. In addition, you come to call us ghosts, while it is you who are dead. If you weren't a ghost would you pay so much attention to a sick person like me? In the end, it's all because I am the king. And you undead need a king to satisfy your vision of history. That's all for today. I'm tired, I'm going home. No need to pay. Uncle Tsang, I'm telling you in all honesty, it's an honor to have driven you today. ♪ finished my day. I am going in the same direction as you. - Where are you going ? - Anywhere. Sorry ? It is all I have. Take me anywhere. When the money is out, drop me off somewhere. Why are there so many sick people in this world? We cross the harbor, okay? It doesn't matter. As long as I don't get home, I'm fine. "Welcome aboard the KW 130 taxi. Please fasten your seat belt." French subtitles: Association Allers-Returns QIN Yun, NIU Xiaowa, Alexis Gaubert
