Niren! Niren! Niren, wake up! Let me sleep, Aditi. It's Sunday. Sleep later. I'm so tense right now. Get up... Now I'm half awake, thanks. Let me be, please! Niren, just look! I'm pregnant. How's that possible? I told you, "Don't be too smart. Use a condom." How's this my fault now? We planned it together. You said the rhythm method was scientifically proven. So you expect me to pop a pill every day? Even if it makes me dizzy? How convenient. You enjoy your oats every morning while Aditi pops pills. Think of the neighbors. Nothing, Papa. Sorry. -Mamma! -Ishaan is up. Ishlu, good morning. Mom, Ishaan is up. Please serve him breakfast. You too come now. The breakfast is getting cold. Aditi, we can't risk it again. Sorry. An abortion is the only option. What are you saying? You know I can't do that. Keep it low, Papa will overhear. We have Ishaan. We were lucky to have him. We don't want any more kids. We didn't plan this, right? I know there's a special reason this child is coming. Stop! I don't believe in all that. It's in our hands. It's your body, so it's your decision. -What if-- -It's a girl? What if she's like Tanya? I don't have the courage, Aditi. Don't you feel incomplete without Tanya? Don't be scared. Have faith in God. He won't make you suffer again. We're calling her Aisha. Aisha means life. Wow! Perfect name. Take it from me. She'll live a hundred years. You're right, Papa. Why are you all morose? Your granddaughter is here. Smile! It's not like I flunked in Math again. Let's celebrate! Sweets for everyone. You first. -Yeah, there's my effort too. -Yeah, of course. She was destined to come home. Let's take a picture. -Okay, everyone let's say Aishi. -Aishi... The absence of tonsils and your family history lead me to conclude that the Indian doctors were right. I can't guarantee anything. But there's a treatment for Aisha. The best match is a sibling. We have a son, Ishaan. Here. This is his blood report. We'll test you both too. Of course. With a deficient immune system, she is prone to infections. Keep her isolated as much as you can. The treatment's very expensive. It could go up to 120,000 pounds. I have some savings. Nonsense. You've already done so much for us. Hardly! Why are you being so formal? The bedroom is yours. No. We're fine here. Even if your dad has to beg, he won't give up. It'll take time. But we aren't leaving until you recover. Until then stay with me, okay? Niren Chaudhary. Sorry, I'm late. I had to take a train. Relax! You're not at the BBC. You may not get big donations. Even if you get 20,000 pounds, consider yourself lucky. Raise your hopes too high and you'll be disappointed. And keep it brief. This is a music program after all. This year on the 27th of March, Aisha Chaudhary was born with SCID. Today we have her father, Niren Chaudhary, with us in the studio. Niren, what does SCID mean? Severe Combined Immune Deficiency. A rare genetic disorder. A baby is born with a deficient immune system. It's impossible to fight infections with this condition. Within a year of their birth, such children... I mean if they do not get the treatment... they won't survive. Our first born, Tanya, suffered from the same deficiency. She did not survive. No, sir. It's okay. What causes SCID? My wife, Aditi, and I have a rare gene. It's a faulty gene. There's a 25% chance our children will inherit this gene. One in a million couples have this gene. We happen to be that couple. The doctors say if she doesn't have a bone marrow transplant in two weeks... our Aisha won't survive. Aisha's parents have managed to collect 60,000 pounds including their life savings. But they need a whopping 120,000 pounds in total. How will they find this amount to save their Aisha? Who will help the Chaudhary family? Who amongst us? Please help us. Remember Sheetal Agarwal? Malvika said she's divorced. She was nuts about you in college. Marry her. Divorce her once you've got the 120,000 pounds. That's the cost I'll have to pay to a divorce lawyer. I'll get you married to Singhania, the fat owner of Ramjas College. He must still be single. Aisha and Ishaan will stay with me. -You can see them on weekends. -Stop it! I'm sure he'd go on a diet for you. What do we tell Ishaan? That his sister has become a star in the sky? I should move to my mother's. Before you and Ishaan get too attached to her-- No one's going anywhere. Focus on one thing at a time. Come on. Goodnight. Aditi, the doctor's on the line. Just hold her. Mrs. Chaudhary... -I'd rather not discuss it on the phone. -You can tell me. What? What do you mean "what?" Obviously, it's a mistake, Niren. Who else could be Ishaan's father? We'll have to repeat the tests. Thank God Anshu is bringing Ishaan here. He'll be a 100 percent match. Now even his life is getting disturbed. If kids don't do well in primary school, passing the ICSE exam is impossible. I know. ICSE exams aren't easy. Who's giving the ICSE test? Ishaan. When he grows up. What are you talking about? I'm suing that hospital. Converting rupees into pounds has wiped me out. What about Ishaan's airfare? Tell me. It's nothing, baby. It's a small prick. Like the tip of a pencil. Look at Mamma. Aishi will say, "My brother Ishaan is so brave. He didn't even cry." That's what Aishi will say. Right? It'll feel like an ant bite. Sorry, Mamma. Sorry, Dadda. Ishlu... You're my brave boy! Kids from North Delhi don't cry. -Who don't cry? -Kids from North Delhi. -What was that about? -Let's not create a scene. What scene? No one knows us here. -Talk in Hindi. Who'll understand? -Please stop it, Aditi. What if someone told you everything you believed was a lie? How would you feel? Acting so cool. Don't beat around the bush! Out with it. I'm not stupid. I know why Ishaan is okay. Because he's not my son. It's obvious. Tanya and Aisha got SCID from me. So, it's my fault? I cheated on you? Take your suspicious, narrow mind back to North Delhi. I had no idea your brain was still stuck on that note! -Must I prove my chastity next? -There's such a thing as science. Fine! Then sit here and use your science to judge my character. If it wasn't for Aisha, Ishaan would not have been retested. I've nothing to prove to you, or to anyone. Go to hell! Sir! Can you do me a favor? Taxis can't park here. Sure. There's a baby named Aisha Chaudhary in the hospital. Please give this to her father. -Any news on the money? -We're trying hard. We have Ishaan and your blood reports. There was some mix-up at the Indian hospital, apparently. I'm sure you knew that already. You are indeed Ishaan's father! So the reports are in? I knew it. I always did. There was no need for a retest. I told Aditi it was a waste of money but she never listens. You know her. Quick to judge, easy to apologize! You're right to be angry. I behaved stupidly. But you're not stupid. Forgive me now. Sorry. -How did you find this in London? -Love has its ways. Arjun Gill. -The radio... -Turn on the radio. We have received 250,000 pounds for baby Aisha Chaudhary! Oh, good God! Indian and British listeners have given generously, but also people from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Afghanistan and many other immigrants have also contributed. I'd like to tell them... You people have treated my daughter as your own. I could not have saved her on my own. Now I'm sure she'll live a long life. Aisha's mother and I want... to give you our heartfelt thanks. Thank you, Arjun. Aisha may join your sister, Taanu, in heaven. -Sorry. -Thank God you're here. Hold her. I hope they haven't taken him in yet. Take care of her. She's crying a lot today. Who knows how long will it take for her new cells to grow. I should be here with you both. You just watch, Aditi. One day I'll make so much money, we don't have to worry about anything. Once Aisha gets well, we'll rob a bank together. Until then you'll have to be Ishaan's mamma too. I hope the chemotherapy has no side effects. Bye, Tootsie. Hello. How are you, Mom? I'm fine, dear. How's Aisha? Yes, he just left. Are you all right? Is Ishaan still up? As though he ever sleeps! Ishaan! Miss Dipti scolded me and made me stand in the corner. Why? Because I colored the sky pink in art class. You can paint the sky any color you want. Always follow your dreams. My friends called me a fool. They said the sky is blue. Stop crying and listen to your Mamma. Okay? There's no need to change the color of your sky for anyone. Ever. Everyone has their own sky. Understand? I painted my sky the color I wanted. If you believe your sky is pink, then it's pink. That's it. Guess what I sent for you with Dadda? Train! Mamma loves you, Ishlu... and your pink sky. Bye, Mamma. Bye, son. Here comes the big plane. And who's flying in it? And the plane flies like... What's this? -Shoulder. -That's your shoulder? I'm going to show you our London home. My tiny cupboard, Aishi's pram. We must keep it covered so no germs or bacteria get through. Our weekly planner. On these days we go to the hospital... Aishi! Look, the plane has landed from Delhi... Wow! She's started to walk. Come, baby. Buying stuff for the house. It's freezing here. My hands are frozen. What are you doing? Has Ishaan eaten? Give him the phone. He's at your Mom's. So I made lunch plans. Who's coming over? Sonia, Ishaan's-- Sir. Put it upstairs. We met a few times at Ishaan's school. Hang on! What do you know about divorce? Why solve her problems? Are you blind? Can't you see what this is about? Aditi, telling you anything is dangerous. How am I a single dad? She should know her rights. We're just discussing that. Are you a divorce lawyer now? Actually, what are you wearing? What are you wearing? A shirt and jeans. What do you expect? Which shirt? The purple one. Oh! Your cool shirt? So, you want to impress her with your dude shirt? Niren, if you wear that shirt-- I'm not changing. Nonsense! I was wrong. Are you taking revenge now? -Come on, Aditi. Rise above it. -Rise above it? Should I rise above the world too? -Your guest has arrived. -I'm off. She's here. -Hi, Sonia. -"Hi, Sonia!" Tell her your mother's ill and you have to see her. Now! I'll call tomorrow. I'm hanging up. Let's get married. How much longer must I kiss this damn phone goodnight? How many people in your neighborhood must I seek permission to marry? the milkman, the newspaper man, the baker... Don't flaunt your upper class South Delhi attitude. You used to once like my family values. Why don't you talk to your family? I'm not afraid of anyone. I could come over and even talk to your parents. You're dangerous. In a sexy way. -Sexy? -Chaudhary! Papa! You? What's up? Can't you sleep? I'm sending her father our phone bill. Go to sleep! Something wrong with you boys. Put your helmet down. My great-grandma used to make chili pickle here. Looks like it's my turn! Shall I crush you into a pickle? -You're so cheap! -That's true. -Technique matters, you know. -Technique's nothing. -I could father a cricket team in one go. -Really? Isn't the stadium a bit small? So I need less of a run up! Gutsy, eh? Let's stop hiding then. Niren, how are you? Fixing the antenna. A lot more needs fixing here! My mother misses you. Come over. I miss her too! Look who's here! Aishi, how are you? I've been calling you for five days. Why didn't you pick up? I didn't hear it ring. Try again. Haven't slept for days. I can't share you. You must solve only my problems. Okay? Besides you... who would I want to impress? This long-distance relationship isn't working, Aditi. So I've got a transfer. -Really? -Yes. Ishaan and your mother are arriving in two days. I talked to his teacher and said we'd be away for six months. And not to give his seat to anyone. Remember we queued up at 5 a.m. for his admission? Careful, your mother has sent parathas and pickle for you. -Not six months, Niren. -Six or eight. We'll see. We can take a buffer of a couple of months. Ten years. Are you kidding? It'll take time for the T cells to grow in her body. And until they do, her body is a war zone. Even going to the airport could be life-threatening. She could collapse. For us, it's just ten years, Niren. For her, it's her entire life. Come, Ishlu, bath time. Mamma has to go to work. It'll only take five minutes. Aisha's crying too. Let me bathe you quickly. Dadda's just coming. -Hello! -Dadda! What took you so long? You know it's hard alone. I wasn't partying. It's okay, baby. Tootsie... Imagine if we had a cricket team! Go to Dadda. How did you get hurt? John pushed me at school. -Why did John push you? -He called me a Paki. And then he slipped into a dream... Aishi. They are here. I'll have her call you. Aisha, please, the dog could give you an infection. Get off! Can't you two see? What's the big deal? Anyway her allergy level is 3/10. It won't kill me. Okay. Let's go inside. We'll check your blood reports first. What good will that do? I'm either lacking in T cells or B cells. I'm done with this immunity program. -To hell with the blood reports. -Aishi! Come. Come. It's okay. They've lost it. You too! Can you imagine? I can't believe it. Aisha's absolutely fine. Her test results are good. She'll have a life like you and I do. -Pinch me! -Once you... Once you fix your mind on something, it's done. I didn't do it alone. We did it. Are you done? -I've been promoted. -What? We must move back to India. Country Head. -But how can we move now? -It's a huge offer. Aisha's tests are normal. For how long will we stay here? I've talked to my boss. Are you asking me? Or telling me? Not asking or telling. We're discussing it. The past 13 years have been difficult in terms of career. And it's no fun here. I know. -But if we have to come back... -Then we will. No one's seizing our passports. -Aaa... -Aamir Khan! "Babes, talented kids like you..." "are like bubbles in a soda bottle." "You rise one by one." As Kareena said, "If you're gawking at me instead of working, it's not my problem!" Gym class today! Half of you go this way, the other half that way. You ought to be on a talent show. Do you ever study? Or is this it? I'm the school's entertainment show. Karan. Aisha. Okay, Aisha, see you later. Santoshi! I told you! Don't wash Aisha's plates with tap water. Use boiled water. Fruits, vegetables or plates. Wash everything with boiled water. Please. She's fragile. Jeet, don't cut vegetables without gloves. Remember? Gloves are a must. Please wear them. Jeet, we'll have to fumigate the farmhouse. Hi, beautiful. You're looking lovely. Sit here. Come. Sit here. Thanks, Moose. My baby. It's the Tree of Life. I just knew... Mom! Dad! Mom! That's Ishaan. -Quick! -What happened? What's wrong? Mamma's here. What happened? She was just lying here. Lift her up. -Aishi, turn the TV off. -One minute. Are you guys getting a divorce? If you are, then I'm living with you. Moose drives me nuts. It's about your lungs. You have something called Busulfan lung damage. It's led to a condition called Pulmonary Fibrosis. -Have you seen the pollution in Delhi? -That's not the cause. It's the side effects of chemo. But that was 14 years ago, right? We knew the side effects of chemo could show up years later. But we had no choice, Aishi. How long does it take to cure this Pulmonary Fibrosis? It's a serious condition. There's no cure yet. But... the doctors have said with good care-- You mean I'm going to die? Answer me, Moose. You made a very wise decision to move back to London. It won't be easy. I know. We also have been through this situation. We know exactly how you feel. As you know, Vivek's mother passed away a month after Aisha died. She was only 73. Running from pillar to post. The treatments, doctors, hospitals, we did it all. To no avail. If you just excuse me, I'll be right back. Let's order. Or I'll faint out of hunger. -Should I go check on her? -No, it's okay. She'll be fine. My wife's right there... can I? Please move outside. Just two minutes, please. Is her mother-in-law's death and Aisha's the same? Obviously not. Leave it now. Once we move to London, she'll be out of our hair. I'm not going anywhere, Niren. What are you saying? Have you thought about Aisha's clothes? Do we take them? Or throw them out? What if her paintings get damaged? And her school bag? Do I junk her books? -Stop it, Aditi. -Why should I? I will not leave Aisha alone here. London is Aisha's home too. I can't live without you. -For how long do I keep following you? -I came to London for you. You didn't come for me. You came for Aisha. And even if you did, so what? What are you implying? You came for your family. Want a medal? If it's too much, why marry? You could've escaped all this. What has gotten into you? Making a mountain out of a molehill. We were just ordering dinner. Then go and eat! Your food must be getting cold. I don't know who I'm talking to sometimes. Do I even know you? What have I been doing for the last 20 years? Looked after Aisha, 24/7. And now that I'm 50, what am I left with? She's gone. Ishaan's busy with his life as he should be. But you? You're all busy. Where's all this coming from? I'm always here for you. What do I have except my work? Are you there for me? I'm not. That's just it. I don't know how to be there for anyone but Aisha. Why are you running away, Niren? Stop for a moment. Talk to yourself. Talk to me. To Aisha. -So what if she's dead? Chapter closed? -Look, do what's right. I did what I could... You of course think I did nothing. Because you did everything for Aisha, not me. It's the limit. How easily you say we should live apart. Ishaan, sir? Sir? Ma'am's calling you. She wants you to hurry up. -What is it? -Put your shoes on. Hurry! -Why? -Because I said so. Where to, Mamma? We'll have a fifth family member! We're adopting. I want you two to meet him before your Dad does. Ishaan, Aisha! I'm waiting in the car. Now! -Hi, Tara. -Hi, Aditi. How are you? -What's his name? -Vivan. And the other babies? -We've come to pick ours. So excited! -They're at the back. What's Moose up to? -Let's go? -Yeah. Come on. We're a family of five now! Go see which one you like. Mom. You made such a fuss about a dog in London. You said Aisha was allergic. Now you're getting her a puppy? She can take anti-allergy pills. Now the risk is greater. There's a risk in everything, Ishaan. Besides nothing matters to me more than her happiness. Rolo! Moose! Did you hear me? He's my Rolo. It's okay if I die now. Come, let's meet Rolo. Aishi, bring Rolo outside. He'll break something in there. Coming! Your grandma is scared of dogs. Let's show her. No! Get away! He won't bite. All three of us lived here. Now look at you, spoilt rich brat. You can say that now. When we moved to London, I thought Dadda would sell my toys. I thought I'd have to earn money for Aishi's operation. But they were good days, Mom. You know I didn't keep you away from us on purpose? I know. You know that boy in your class... What's his name? Karan. You know everyone's name? I know everything! Aisha has a crush on him. How do you know? Checking our phones? Haven't checked yours yet. Tell you what... ask Karan to take Aishi on a date. How on earth did you concoct this stupid, ridiculous, weird plan, Mom? If Aishi finds out we've set up a date for her, she'd go ballistic. Who'll tell her? Do as I say. Or I'll do it. Aisha thinks he likes her too. And maybe he does. Or maybe because of her illness... I don't know. But there's no harm in asking. Worst case, he'll say no. You'll be marrying her off soon! If only I could, Ishaan. You're an ace at emotional blackmail. Tell me... do you and Karan... Does he brush his teeth regularly? If he does, no harm kissing him. -He's just a friend. -It's just a kiss. Look at this sweater. I hope they've got my size. Look. They don't. Excuse me. One second, ma'am. -Yes, ma'am. -Do you have a small? -It should be on the rack. -It's not. I checked. Maybe it's out of stock. You'll have to order it. Here's a small. Ma'am, you can't take that off. Why not? Ma'am, you just can't. Store policy. We do have other styles. Please have a look. Moose, it's not that great. Let's go. Come on. -What are you doing? -Keep an eye out. Must you prove to the world that you're crazy? Tell me if someone's coming. Excuse me, ma'am. Do you need any help? -No, thank you. -Please call me if you do. Moose, hurry up! Come. Aishi, don't go beyond kissing, I'm telling you. No sex! You're too young. Anything you want to discuss, we can discuss it. Please don't give me a heart attack and say you've done it. Moose, please! You haven't done it yet, right? How old were you when... -When? -...you and Dad did it for the first time? -Do you know what they're all thinking? -What? That we'll have sex tonight. Imagine the performance pressure! I'm taking full advantage of the presidential suite your colleagues gifted us. Actually, Papa has spoken to his brother... you know he owns a hotel in Chandni Chowk? We're staying there tonight. They'll be hurt otherwise. Please understand. It isn't that bad. It's big enough for us. Anyway it's not as though we're sleeping tonight! Your hair is so beautiful. Like my hair? Then sleep with it. Take this. And this. -Not my wedding turban! -Enjoy! Aditi! Uncle! I'm Aisha's friend. Karan. Karan! Hi, come. Ishaan! Hi, Karan. -I think that's Karan. -You go now, please. Rolo. -Hi. -Hi. Is that Rolo? -Want some? -No, thank you. Can I get you something? -Double espresso. -Sure. Yeah. Hello, Ishaan. Get Karan to see Aisha's artwork. An excuse to send them to her room. Ishaan! Easy. Hi, Uncle. Hey, Moose. -Hi, Karan, how are you? -I'm good. Why did he use that door? He should use the main door. Hush. He's a friend. I don't like this. -A portrait of Rolo? -No, a self-portrait. Ma'am, your tea. Santoshi, I'll have the usual. The usual? In a minute. Don't you understand art? -Meaning? Where are you? -Take a closer look. I can't see you. Right there, on the bed. When I'm not around, I'll still be here. Forever. Don't you guys think Aisha could be a great inspirational speaker? Tell ma'am we're leaving in five minutes. -Hi, Uncle. -Hi. No bananas? -I beg your pardon! Do forgive me. -It's okay. I'll go get Aishi. Ladies and gentlemen, Aisha Chaudhary. Aisha, what's wrong? Come here. What's wrong, baby? Never mind. Go to sleep. What nonsense! She has a medical condition, so she can't parasail. We're taking responsibility, so what's your problem? It's still risky, right? If she has a medical emergency, we'll be making the headlines. That's nonsense! Moose, it's okay. You guys go ahead. -Of course not. -No way. We all go, or none of us do. Aishi... Baby, look at Mamma. Oh, God, please. Niren! Her oxygen levels are dropping. Aishi? Is the machine working? The pilot must make an emergency landing. Ishaan, ask the stewardess to get us their spare oxygen tank. Now! You can't enter the cockpit. Ma'am, it's an emergency, I must talk to the pilot. -What's wrong? -My daughter can't breathe. -I need oxygen for my sister. -Sir, please don't run. Just look at Mamma. Keep your eyes open. Her lungs are weak. She can't handle low air pressure. Please lower the plane's altitude. Ma'am, calm down. What is your name? I know Captain Kapoor. Let me talk to him. What happened? Don't let Aisha's smile deceive you, her condition is worse. It's a natural progression of her illness. We must go for a lung transplant now. We discussed this when Aisha was first diagnosed. Maybe it's time. You know I'm against a transplant. It'll prolong her life by ten years, Aditi. Start the process. Tell me where to sign. And how much it'll cost. -We're doing it. -No, we're not. -We're doing it, Aditi. -Over my dead body! -What nonsense? -Let's discuss this somewhere else. Why would Nirvick suggest a transplant needlessly? He's a doctor. Let him do his job. Answer me then. A lung transplant is challenging even for a healthy body. She's so unwell. How will she cope? You want her to end her days tied to a hospital bed? Will she be able to walk? Will she be happy? Could you face such a life? Or must she live for your peace of mind? Do we let her die? She's not only your child... she's mine too. This time your stubbornness won't work. -I'm being stubborn? -Yeah... Stubborn! I've researched her medical condition for years. I badgered the doctors over every detail. So what if I'm being stubborn! Sorry. This time I'm not backing down. We're going for a transplant. It's my final decision. So you'll blindly follow the doctor's advice and not use your own brain? Our know-how is irrelevant here. Their training and experience is what matters. What did you do when it came to Tanya? You listened to the doctors. And what happened? They aren't always right. No doctor can guarantee a successful outcome. Will you guarantee it? Niren's blood was meant to increase Tanya's hemoglobin... instead it has made her worse. Tanya has SCID, Severe Combined Immune Deficiency. If only you had come earlier, I would've suggested you take her to London. But now it's too late. Not more than 24 hours. I've been telling you for the last 5 months... something's seriously wrong with Tanya. But neither you nor those ten doctors listened to me. "Children always get fever. Have a Valium. Stop worrying." It's all your fault. No, baby. Please. Don't cry. Please. Mother Mary understands your pain. Then why doesn't she save my Taanu? Because she understands her pain too. Don't cry. Mamma may be selfish... but not that selfish to ignore your suffering. Go, my baby. Next time come back healed. Your paintings should be in an exhibition. What do you want? Honestly. They're really good. Panda... Cut to the chase. Tell me what you really want. Uncle Nirvick suggests you have a lung transplant. It'll prolong your life by ten years. Shouldn't we take that chance? Why? You think it'll be easier to die at 28 instead of 18? We'll get to spend ten more years together, Aishi. I want you for as long as possible. This isn't enough. I've had enough, Panda. I don't want any more problems. Who knows what happens now, Anshu. Niren's with her. I'll call you later. -Where do you want to sit? -Near Moose. Come, my baby. Moose, sit here. I want to paint you. No, no, please. I don't like posing. You'll treasure the painting after I die. Nonsense! You are not going to die. Obviously not this minute. Sit down, please. -Moose, cover your head. -I never cover my head. Let the painter do her job. Go on. Okay? Over your shoulder. Okay now? Stop. Statue. Don't move. Don't make such a sad face. I'll tell you what... think of something nice. Like when Panda kissed you the first time. Or when you were pregnant with me. You were round like a football. Hey, Internet Queen! I was just checking... Aish. Aish, what's wrong? Giraffe, I don't want to die. How can I leave you, Moose, Panda? Okay, Aish. I know this is a horrid, shitty situation. I understand that. Mom, Dad and I will join you very soon. A new family isn't created every time. The same family gets reincarnated. maybe in the next, you'll be my Dad. And Mom will be your wife. No, wait. Let's not make Mom your wife. So she won't enter our rooms without knocking! You know what? Next time you can be Rolo. Eat, sleep, poop, bark, even bite, if something enrages you. Don't forget to call. Every day. Aditi, what's wrong? What are you doing? Stop it. What's going on? Must be a bad dream. -Go back to sleep. -I want some tea. All men are bastards! You'll wake Aisha. What's this drama? Get off me! Get off! Control yourself. Come, let's go and have a cup of tea. -She wants to have some tea. -Yes, sure. Ma'am! Grab her legs! Don't let her go. She'll be fine. -Take care of Aisha. -I'm here. Jeet, open the car door. -What's wrong with her? -We'll have to take her to Vimhans. -The mental hospital? -She's having a psychotic breakdown. Will she be okay? Don't worry, Panda. Moose will be fine. I'm not thinking about her. I won't kick the bucket until Moose comes home. I can't bear to think... how miserable she'll make your life when I'm gone. I'll talk to Ishaan. Maybe she'd feel better if he came home. Panda, there's only one sane person left in this family. Let him be. Jeet, where's Aisha? Upstairs with sir. -Anshu, I'm going up. -I'll just come. Please give me a cup of tea. Guys, control! It's only been a week. I've missed you. You're back, my drama queen. A gift for you. Someone had to look after the house. And Panda. So I did. I even finished writing my book. Not everyone can avoid responsibilities like you. Niren, let's look for a publisher. By the way, the publisher really liked her book. -What? -Bloomsbury. Wow! I should do double drama next time... so you'll write a sequel! Aishi. Here you go. You're okay. Breathe, baby. Try and lie back. I'll tell Santoshi to make chocolate waffles for breakfast. Niren, come home. Quick. Yes. Ishaan, wake up. Aisha's not good. Stay with her. I have to make a few calls. I know the book launch is tomorrow... but I must have a copy of Aisha's book today. I know, but please understand... time is precious for her. Hey, Sport. Look... You called and I came. Hello, Nirvick. She's using a lot of oxygen. I've ordered four more cylinders. How soon can you get here? Please hurry. Aishi, can you tell whether this is Ishaan's hand or mine? You've grown old, Panda. You should use Moose's anti-aging cream. Aishi. You know... I act like I'm very strong... like things are cool with me. And everything is okay. But in my heart... a day doesn't pass when I am not thinking of you. Giraffe loves you, Aishi. What is it? Careful, baby. And my kissy? -Only two cylinders? We ordered four. -They're in the car. Go get them and clear out the empty ones. Ma'am, the soup. Aishi! Come to me. Look! Your book. "Aisha Chaudhary." "FAREWELL NIREN" What can I say? I completely forgot I used to play in a band. Having a blast. -A grand farewell was a must! Right? -Thank you. Aditi's coming, right? Excuse me. A whiskey soda, please. Niren Chaudhary. You've always had the last word at every meeting. So why not here? So, before you run away to London, you could do your apologizing now. Here's your chance. Come on up here, Mr. Chaudhary. Thanks for this joyous and amazing farewell party. If I knew you'd enjoy my farewell so much... you should've given me a hint, I'd have left ages ago. The first time I went to London was in 1996 for Aisha's treatment. I had no money for the airfare. Someone at the office heard. And soon an empty lunch box was passed around. You gave me whatever you could and bid me a warm farewell. As your boss, you were my responsibility... but it's you guys who looked out for me. Then don't go, Niren. Aditi doesn't want us to leave Delhi either. But pain leaves you so empty. It wears you down. The only difference is I deal with pain in one way, Aditi in another. Our home here... so filled with memories of Aisha... haunts me constantly. Maybe that's why I can't bear to look at photos of my children. Ever since she left us... I can't enter her room. I feel scared... that if I entered I'd lose her again. But last night I did go in. I sat down. It felt as though she was there. I looked at her drawing books. She had this habit of hiding stories... in her paintings, writings and videos. After Aisha passed away, no one had the courage to open her laptop. But maybe we should have a long time ago. Moosical... Missing me? Want to cry? Okay, cry. But don't throttle Panda's neck again in your sleep. I promised Panda... until you were back from the mental hospital, I wouldn't die. The promise is slightly risky, so I'm recording this video. If I do die, then we won't get to say goodbye. I've thought about death every day. I've literally gobbled life up. So death doesn't worry me. Don't let it worry you either. I've lived life to the fullest. Moose, thank you for not aborting me. And Panda, you spent your entire life slaving away for us... for party-crashers like us. Giraffe, a part of me will always be with you. Please none of this "survivor's guilt" or I'll whack you. I'm sorry, Panda. I couldn't go for that lung transplant. Remember my self-portrait? Even when I'm not around, I'll be there. Forever. Don't worry about me. I'm chilling with Tanya... while you all are watching this video. We're partying together... in the sky. The Pink Sky. Take care of my Rolo. That's nothing. Look over there.
