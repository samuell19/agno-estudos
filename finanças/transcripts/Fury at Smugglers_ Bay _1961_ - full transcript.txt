In Eighteenth Century England the crippling taxes levied by the Lords of the Manor drove honest fishermen into the business of smuggling. In the proven tradition of their French ancestors, these fisher folk fought for their existence. and they harmed no-one. But there were others who came down to the sea to lure ships to their doom, to murder survivors and to plunder cargoes. They were known as 'The Wreckers', the dregs of humanity who counted no man as friend. - Welcome home, milord. - Thank you, Tom. - Pleasant journey, milord? - It was tedious. Yes, yes. - Papa! - Jenny. -How are you, Papa? - I'm very well, thank you. - How's London? - Very noisy and very dirty. It's good to breathe God's fresh air again. - Tom, help Edward with the boxes, will you? - Yes, milord. - Where's Christopher? - Christopher? Oh, I'll find him. We weren't expecting you until tomorrow, papa. I'll tell Christopher you're here. - Chris! - Don't bother me. Chris, Papa's back. Louise! Well, chéri, do you think I'm improving? That's funny, where did Louise get to? She was here a... - Father, you're a day early. - So it seems. - Who was the young lady? - Oh, the young lady? Oh, she's a friend of Jeremy's... So she just happened to come in and watch us fence. - Happened to come in? - Yes. I warned you. - Will you excuse me, papa? - Certainly Jenny. I hardly approve your choice of servant for a fencing opponent! I trust you always win. Invariably, sir. However, in future, I think Jeremy should confine his activities - to the stables. - As you wish, father. Well now, has everything been in order during my absence? - There was a wreck a few nights ago, sir. - Indeed. - There were no survivors. - Was the light not working? I don't know. I questioned the watchman. He said it was, but... - I think he was lying. - Why should he lie? Well, there's a rumour that a gang of cutthroats have moved into the district. One of them has been recognised. He's known as 'Black John'. Have you heard of him, father? He was once tried for piracy. Turned King's evidence to save his own skin. You seem to be well informed. I made it my business to find out about him. Thank you, Christopher. I shall investigate this man myself. Now that I'm back you need not concern yourself. - It's giving way, Skipper! - Keep an eye on the fore-beam! Turn the wheel! Get over this wash! Aye, you lads, take her! I can't see the land, sir! Go the the Helmsman. Tell him what's happened! They won't see the boat in this sea. - Go on, hurry! - Come on! (SPEAKS FRENCH) - What is it? - The wreckers. We saw the light go out at the point. - It is the third time. - Someone ought to see Squire Trevenyan. - Who do you suggest? - Why not yourself? What should I tell him? Should I tell the noble squire that the wreckers are interfering with the rights of honest smugglers like ourselves? Ourselves? Do you think that Trevenyan doesn't know that every fisherman in this town is a smuggler? But you're a merchant! Nevertheless I am a participant. A merchant, yes, a merchant who works closely with the men who go down to the seas in ships. Honest smugglers! Trevenyan is not a fool. - He has a word for men such as I. Receiver. But these men are ruining our business, both fishing and smuggling! Are you fond of your neck? Squire Trevenyan is a good man. I'm not afraid. All right. we go to see him. I am fond of my neck, but I take a chance. - Get my coat, please. - All right. It's a survivor! Get him to the Frenchman! John! Black John! Hurry man! Black John's excise men! Get back here! - Get back! - They had a survivor with them. Get that stuff away as fast as you can. Come on. Come on Jasper. You should be keeping note of your worst customers! Curse the day you came here! Your just trouble like them! Is it trouble that cost you? Get in there now and you too can make an honest landlord! - Put it down. Put it down, I say! - Do as the lady said. What are you doing to the poor fellow? Put him down like the Captain told you! And how is your honour this morning? I hear our noble lord is on his way to the Duke of Avon. Trevenyan? They say he'll attempt to patrol the coast with the military, gentlemen. - Bad for business, hey John? - We'll see. - Has the squire left yet? - We'll go and see, sir. Thanks for the tip. - Don't be leaving without your ale, captain. - Business calls. - I'll see you at the camp, sweetheart. - I'll be there, captain. Highwayman! Hold! Hold! - Your purses, gentlemen. You're a stubborn man, squire. Thank you, gentlemen. My regards to the Duke of Avon.

I can't spare any officers. What are you going to do with the rascals? I intend to put down smuggling in my district, and I'm prepared to use the sternest possible measures. Smuggling hey? I thought they all did a bit of that in your party of the country. What about these wrecker fellows here? Hope you are doing something about them. - I mean smugglers, wreckers... It's the same word to me. What do you think? I agree with you. They are synonymous. Synon...ymous... That's a very good word but it's too long for a man in my state of health. When do you want these soldiers? At your earliest possible convenience. What are you going to do, hang the whole community? I shall make an example of certain of them. Good. Some...something with other countries losing money hand over fist. I, I'll see you get the soldiers. Yes sir. - Have a little refreshment before you go. - Thank you, no. - Nice to see you. - Goodbye your grace. Bye. Take care of yourself dear boy. - Goodbye. - Your grace. - It was the captain! - The Highwayman? Yes, sir. He's quite a character. Everybody knows him in the district. They say when he robs someone and they have to return the same way he stands watch to make sure no further harm comes to them. How very thoughtful of him. Oh, it shows that he's a decent fellow at heart, doesn't it, sir? Yes, he's quite a mystery man. Nobody knows his real name. He's simply known as 'The Captain'. How do you know so much about this man? - One hears these things, sir. - Precisely, but who from? Various people. Some of the... I wonder if you've learned of the Captain’s gallantry through your association with Legeune's daughter? How do you know about her? One hears these things. I’m displeased with you, Christopher. - Gravely displeased. Why did you never speak of this before? I'd hoped your intelligence would eventually govern your behaviour. I'm sorry, sir, but I love her. - Indeed. - Haven't you ever loved anyone, father? I don't mean to be impertinent, but if you had, you'd know how I feel. You must consider your position in the world, Christopher. This girl is the daughter of a tradesman. - I suspect him of receiving stolen goods. - It's even possible that he's responsible for the recent wrecking, - or at least concerned with it. - It isn't true. - I realise now why you defend Lejeune. You will see this girl and you will tell her it is for the last time. - I can't do that. - You disobey me? I have no choice. We love each other and I intend to marry her. We will see. Chris! Is something the matter? Alas, there is something I must tell you. My father's going to use soldiers. They arrive tomorrow. - You must tell your people. - I will. - Come on, hurry! - Shh! Black John! They're heading for the beach. - You stay here. - Don't follow them Chris. Please! I'll be all right. - I must warn the watchman. You stay in the cottage. I'll see you when I come back. Don't worry. The water's too rough! I can't hold her! Chris! Chris! Chris! Christopher? Are you all right? What happened? - What happened to me isn't important. - It is to me. I followed Black John and his men down to the beach. - I saw them at work. - what happened? I killed a man. - You what? - It was self-defence. You needed evidence against the wreckers. Now you've got it. I'm your witness. Suppose Black John were to lay charges against you- of murder... For God's sake father, what are you saying? Are you allowing this man to rule the district? To rule you? Something's happened to you. I don't think you even believe what you're saying. You can question Lejeune, Red Friars, Roger Treherne, any of the men in the village. They'll tell you the truth! They'll tell you what these cutthroats did tonight! Another ship wrecked, sailors murdered in cold blood! They can tell you. They witnessed it. They are doubtful witnesses, Christopher. Smuggler's, all of them. We'll talk about this again in the morning. If you please, go to your room. Come in. - Are you ready? - Yes, sir. You understand why I'm sending you away? I killed a man? During your absence you'll have time to reflect upon this day. For your own sake, Christopher, I ask you to think very carefully. I'll never change my mind. Goodbye, father. - Hello. - Hello. - Thank you. - Thank you. Jenny! Hello Jenny. I have a message from Christopher. - What is it? - He gave me this letter for you. I'm very sorry. You are very kind, Jenny. Will you give him a message for me? Yes, of course I will. Tell him I love him. I will always love him. Don't worry. Chris will come back. - I live only for the day we meet again. - In the meantime, if you are in trouble or need me, - write to the above, which is my address in London, and I will return. Stop a minute. Don't watch me go. Quickly lads, for wreckers the night is lost. - Papa! - What is it? The soldiers are patrolling the beach. I warned you! Halt! Open fire! - Where was this cave? - Close to the point, sir. - did all the men escape? - One dead, sir. - Where are your men now, back at camp? - Yes, sir. Very good. Now this is a list of people I have under observation. They're all suspects. I want their homes searched immediately. If an account of all the goods in their possession cannot be made - you are to arrest them. - Very good, sir. Françoise Lejeune, have you anything to say before sentence is passed upon you? Yes, your honour. I say that I am being condemned on the evidence of two men who should be standing in my place! Black John states that he saw me receiving stolen goods on the beach. The watchman swears that it was I who forced him to douse his light so that the ship was wrecked. - Both these men are liars! Do you deny the charges of smuggling and receiving? I deny the charge of wrecking. I have never taken a life. Answer my question. I do not deny the charge of receiving. You have each been found guilty on the first charge of smuggling. Against you Françoise Lejeune, the charge of receiving has also been proved. The evidence of the witnesses is irrefutable. It is also the opinion of this court That you were responsible for the death of a survivor, - who was brought to your house on the night of the wreck of the Mary Ann. - The penalty for the charges proved against you is death or deportation. - But as to this third charge of wrecking, - The court finds this not true. and therefore will exercise due clemency, in respect to the first and second charges Each of you will suffer deportation to a colony where you will remain and undergo confinement and servitude for the rest of your natural lives. Come in. There's a young person asking to see you, milord. - Who is it? - Louise Lejeune. - I have nothing to say to her. - Yes, milord. I am praying. Thank you, Charles. - I am praying that you will be able to return soon to help my father. - My mother sends you her love. - God bless you and keep you safe. - I love you always. Louise. - Charles. - Yes, sir? Get my things. Pack everything. We're leaving. Yes, sir. Hurry. Papa. Some food for you. Some pasties, your favourite. You know. Mama cooked them herself. - Papa, are you all right? - Yes, I'm all right, Louise. If they send you away perhaps we can come to you. Louise, do you remember... I often spoke to you of a great friend of mine, he is a Highwayman, 'The Captain' they call him...do you remember that? - Yes, papa. - He is not far from here. I know he uses the tavern that they call... 'The Quiet Lady'. Go to him and tell him what has happened. The Captain is a very brave man. I once helped to save his life. Perhaps he can think of some way of helping me. When will they send you away? Perhaps not for a long time. Perhaps tomorrow. Who knows? I will find him. Au revoir. - What can I do for you? - I am the daughter of Françoise Lejeune. He is to be congratulated. How is my good friend? - He is in great danger. - Françoise is always in great danger. - That's what I like about him. - Please. I'm sorry. But you must do what's proper... He's tried to take his cap off... - Go and tell your father I'll do all I can. - I'm very grateful to you. It may take a little time. Don't get impatient if nothing happens for a few days. Is this your horse? - Feeling more cheerful now? - I put all my faith in you. Good! No you don't! Perhaps you'll tell me why you've been to see the captain? And while you're explaining maybe we'll have a bit of fun! This lady's a friend of mine, but you were just playing, weren't you? Well, you get down on your knees and put your face in the dust and say you're sorry. I'll see you in hell. You never spoke a truer word, Black John, but that'll come later. Now do as I say. Tis a grand says that you'll be a half-captain! And as a man of chivalry myself. It gives me great pleasure to be honourable of the lovely lady. Apologise I will. On your knees. - You all right? - Yes, thank you. I admire his taste. - Fetch your mealy-mouthed master out here. - Please, please. - I want to talk to him. Just tell him my name and he'll see what's happening. Come on, tell him that! All right, Tom. I told you never to come here. I give the orders, squire. - What do you want? - Withdraw the soldiers. Today! - On one condition. - Condition! You're not making the conditions. You found your wreckers so we don't need the military. Get rid of them Trevenyan. You know...as a boy I used to be afraid of you. The high and mighty Mr. Trevenyan. You'd give the orders and I had to obey. Now the boot's on the other foot and you hate it, don't you? You hate it as much as you hate me! Well, go on, hate me squire. It won't do you any good. Pour it out all over me, but enjoy it because I know what it's doing to you! It's twisting you like a knife in your guts and there's nothing you can do about it. You's best do as I say, squire. Oh... As a matter of interest, what was the condition? That you and your gang of cutthroats leave this district. Me and my cutthroats! Now don't you threaten me, Mr. Trevenyan! I could ruin you and still remain in town. I could burn this place down and there's nothing you could do about it. I could scream the glad tidings about you to every ear in the country, that isn't stone deaf! And there'd be lots glad to hear about your darling little Christopher, being the result... of an indiscretion...shall we say? Good day to to you, squire. - Hello captain. - My ears have been burning. I'm not surprised. You should hear some of the things Black John's been saying about you. Well, I wouldn't laugh at that. He's threatened to kill you. I wish him luck. It's you that I'm worried about. I don't like you working in that place. You wouldn't have need. Anyone can have me. Except the captain. - Captain! Hey, captain! A coach, captain Coming soon. Over there. Yes, Juma. I think I know who it is. Get my horse and bring me a spare one. Business calls. See you later. Hold! Good morning. I'm afraid the haul won't be so good this time, captain. Take this letter to your master, Squire Trevenyan, with my compliments. Drive ahead. - What the devil? - Hold! I'm holding you as a hostage against the life of one Françoise Lejeune. - Get on that horse. Follow me. 'And finally, if these men are not released by tomorrow, your son will die.' Why did he come back? - You will release them? - I can't, Jenny. What about Chris? The captain wouldn't do this. He's not a murderer. - Do you really believe that? There's some other reason why you cannot release these men! Why did Black John come here yesterday? - What is it you're wanting, mister? - I would like to speak to Black John. Come this way, mister. I'll take you up. What can I do for our noble lord of the manor? I should like to speak to you alone. You don't need to tell me anything, squire. News travels fast in this part of the country. - You know about my son? - Before you did. And you can talk to now till doomsday. It'll make no difference. Then you know what will happen to him if I cut out the sentences on those men? Sure I do! And it gives me a grand feeling! Do you remember when you used to have the whip-hand? Do you remember the whip you used on my back when I was a servant? I remember. Take care I don't use it again. I dare you! Come in. You wanted to see me, papa? Oh yes, Jenny. Sit down will you. - Jenny... - Yes? Today you asked me why Black John came here. I want you to know the truth. I've brought up Christopher to believe that he is my legitimate heir. He is not. I was never married to his mother. Do you understand what that means? She died soon after he was born. Then I married your mother and she adopted Christopher as her own son, and you were brought up together. Black John found out about this? Yes. He was my groom. I caught him ill-treating a horse and I thrashed him. Soon after this he disappeared, taking with him a good deal of money and some letters that I'd foolishly kept. - And these he still has. Jenny, I wanted so much to keep your respect. - And your love. You will always have my love. Thank you, Jenny...and Christopher? Nothing will make any difference to him. What about the future, to live with the knowledge and the disgrace to be pointed at wherever he goes? Papa. Chris and I are very close to each other. I know him even better than you do. You won't lose his love because of this. If you were to offer Black John a bribe? If I gave him everything I possessed it wouldn't make any difference. There must be something we can do. These men I sentenced had a fair hearing. I must do what is right according to the law. - Thank you, Juma. - You look sad, Missy. - I'm worried. - Why are you worried? I'm always worried when someone has to die. Are you serious about this boy? I mean it's only a threat isn't it, you don't mean to kill him? Is it going to be necessary? I asked you a question. They're sending the men away tomorrow. You can't kill him. I never go back on my word. If you can't stomach this you'd better get back to the inn. Why don't you get it over? I don't fancy the idea of killing a man in cold blood. - Is killing me going to help Lejeune? - Is keeping you alive going to? If I help you to save him? The trouble is you don't know how... anymore than I do. You know what they're thinking? They're thinking, is he... Is he going to weaken at the last moment? It's awkward for both of us, isn't it? Especially you. Have you no suggestions? I might have by tomorrow. Tomorrow! It'd better be good. Captain, they tell me you're one of the best swordsmen in England. At least give me a chance. Let me fight for my life. All right. But it'll make no difference to the result. - I'll take a chance on it. - When do you want to fight? Well, now. - Juma! - Yes, sir, boss. Give the gentleman a sword, and bring me mine. I can't afford to be as callous as you, captain. Which is it to be, my life or your? Put up your sword. Where'd you learn to fight, mister? - Some time you teach me, no? - Well, I never expected to see that! - I was lucky. - The captain slip. Anybody can slip. I'd like to thank you. Now that you're still alive, how are you going to justify your existence? How are you going to save Lejeune? The only way is to prove to my father beyond any doubt that Black John is responsible for the wrecking and no-one else. Brothers of mercy. You know I don't suppose sacrilege is any worse a crime than robbery or an occasional killing. What do you say, master swordsman? Head them off! Is this your doing, Trevenyan? Where are our soldiers? Your orders have been obeyed. There are no soldiers. Do you think this is going to save your son's life? Let me tell you he's already dead! Chris! Chris, where is papa? He's safe. You won't be able to see him for some time but he's in good hands. - He's safe and well. - Can't we see him? - I'm afraid not. - Why not? Until we can prove his innocence he's still an outlaw. It would be dangerous to take you to him. I have a plan which may help him, but it will take time. - What is your plan? - The less you know the better. Is it dangerous? Not too dangerous. Now listen to me carefully, both of you. What ever happens, everyone has to think that I am dead. - This is very important. - Even your father? Yes, including my father. There's something else I want you to do for me. I want you to find me some old clothes. The older the better. Some old fishing clothes. Some jackets, some boots. Can you do this? - I will find some. - Don't be too long. - You sent for me, milord? - Thank you, Tom. I want you to give this to the Duke of Avon. Take the long road. I'll be safer. - You should reach there by nightfall. - Yes, milord. - Well? - It's all arranged. Black John lost five men in the fight yesterday, so he'll be glad of a new hand. - Good. - But you'll have to be careful, Chris. He'll be very suspicious. - When do I have to meet him? - You must come to the tavern tonight. Black John's no fool. You bear that in mind, both of you. - If he finds out who you are... - Yes, I know, I know, but... I don't think he's ever seen me before. Maybe I cut Black Johnny's throat? A very good idea but unfortunately it won't prove anything. - Maybe I go with Chris? - Maybe you stay here and keep out of trouble. Maybe I go back to the tavern. Good luck, Chris. John's in his room. Up the stairs. He's expecting you. - What's your name? - Jonathan Roach. I was the third mate on the Stafford. Haven't I seen you before? - I doubt it. - How long were you at sea? - Ten years. - And before that? - Does it matter? - I'm asking the questions. I didn't come here to give you my personal life history. I've told you I'm a seaman. I've told you what ship I'm off. - I could give you a lot of help. If you don't want it there's no good in wasting my time. Is there? Now wait a minute. Wait a minute. Did you ever hear of a Highwayman called 'The Captain'? - No. - Well, we're paying him a visit. - Come and see the fun. - Friend of yours? No! No, no, no. He's no friend of mine. I just want to see how good a shot you are. If you're going to join us, you've got to be a good shot. This will be a test. - This is your quarrel. - You'll do as I say. So, you can handle a whip! I came here to make money, see. I'm not interested in your private war. The sooner we all understand that, the better! There's a ship due in harbour tomorrow night. Now which is more important, your quarrel with a highwayman or a ship? who's going to tell you about the ship? That's my business. But as a matter of interest, she's carrying gold. All right. You get your information and come back here. We'll be home before dawn. - I've got to warn the captain. - It's all right, he's been warned. Sit down... Throw him in the pond. Juma! - Where's Juma? - He left camp about an hour ago. - I thought he went to find you. - An hour ago? I hope he's all right. My orders are to report to you by the Duke of Avon, sir. - Very good, sergeant. Follow me. - Forward! Halt! The wreckers usually work in this area. It's known as 'Smuggler's Bay'. You must keep constant watch. I don't think you'll have long to wait. Yes, sir. We'll attack as soon as they appear on the beach. - And we'll shoot to kill...every man. - Very good, sir. She's here. Where have you been, my darling? Are you avoiding me now? Where I usually go at this time. Been taking food to my grand-folk. - Wait. - Why? It must be her. Who else could have warned him? I said wait. Just see she doesn't stray too far. The ship passes the headland shortly after midnight. We leave here after sundown Have you got that? - Where's Roach? - Down on the beach. - Do you think we can trust him? - You're going to find out tonight. You and the Spider. Go and see for yourselves. My job is to make ready the whaler. Then I must light three fires at intervals along the beach. That will be for the soldiers? It will also serve as a warning to the ship. - Now as soon as I leave you must go to my father. - If he can get the soldiers here in time, he must be prepared to attack as soon as the fires are lit, right? What about you? Don't worry about me. I have nine lives. Chris, I'm scared. If Black John is caught red-handed, your father will be cleared of the charge. But if your father's caught first, he'll be hanged. Now, we have three hours to work. Juma! Man tried to kill you. Me follow him and kill him first. Very good, no? Very good, yes. Who is it? One of Black John's men. - They know who you are? - No, I don't think so. At least they won't find out from him. Thank you, Juma. Me come with you. Me help you, yes? Yes, I think you can. Come. Look out for you mama. John, what will you say if we have an informer among us? - I'd cut his throat. - What if the informer was a woman? What'd you say then? I'd cut her throat and take pleasure in doing it. - So where's Rider? - Lying outside Lejeune's cottage. - With a knife in his back. - And Roach? He got away. That cousin of yours, Betty, now let's have the truth. I told you the truth. Let me go! I suppose this cousin of yours wouldn't be Squire Trevenyan's son, would he? No! It couldn't be that he's planning a little trap for us, hey, my darling? And it couldn't be that you knew him from the start? It's getting late Betty. You'd best get along home. I said get along. If you told the truth you've nothing to be frightened of. - Are you mad! - You always wanted a little fun with her. When you're finished with her we'll meet yo down on the beach. - The beach? - Why not? What could the squire do without soldiers? All right, Callas, I want you to go straight to the captain. Don't take too long. On your way. Oh captain, captain! All right, all right. You're not hurt. - What are you doing here anyway? - I was at the inn and... Oh captain, they found out about Chris. Who he is. He'll be on the way to the beach now. Go to the camp and stay there until I get back. I have to see him! It's his son's life! I've told you, everyone knows master Christopher is dead. That is not true! Jenny! - You've seen Chris? - Yes, but he's in great danger. - He's going to light fires on the beach. - Christopher's alive! - He's going to light fires on the beach. He's trying to help you to capture the wreckers! - You mean he's there now? - Yes! - Jenny... - What's the matter, papa? I ordered the soldiers to kill every man they see. Platoon leaders, after him! Stay back and defend your son, Trevenyan. If the soldiers don't get him then Black John will. - He's walked into a trap. Chris! Father! The soldiers. Get out quickly! Thanks for your hospitality. It was a pleasure. Well, as new lord of the manor you shouldn't be seen talking to the likes of me. Captain, I'll recommend you for a free pardon. If you prefer, I'll give you a head start. - Will you look after Juma? - Of course. - A free pardon, hey? I don't think free pardon's are for the likes of me. - Thanks for the head start. - Where are you going? - Oh, a long way from here. My gift to the new squire. Subtitles 2020 Noilly Prat
