Go on in! If you hear the voice of the forest, you must not move. This is a legend in our village. What's this "voice of the forest?" Sometimes, we hear a mysterious sound that makes the heart thump. That's the sound the forest's guardian god makes when he time warps. Time warps? Yes, the forest's guardian god has the power to time warp. If you don't want to travel to another era, don't move when you hear the voice of the forest. Do you understand? Yes. I'll be careful. Excuse me. Ah! You! Wait a sec! Here's some bread I made. Feel free to eat it. I put lots of forest berries in it. Here you go. Thank you very much. I missed you in Ubame Forest... but not today! Don't let him escape! After him! Stop it! Two against one isn't fair! Hand over that Celebi. "Celebi?" Is this...? Why are you doing such terrible things to him?! I'm a hunter. I catch rare Pokémon and sell them at high prices. Pokémon aren't products! Hand it over! No way! This sound... 40 Years Later Would you please tell me the location of the forest in which you failed to catch Celebi forty years ago? That was my catch. I won't tell you. Stubborn old man. What's that? A Dark Ball. What?! Go, Dark Ball. This changes the Pokémon caught with it into evil monsters and brings out their maximum power. Come out, Evil Bangiras! Destroy everything. No way... my Bangiras... Please stop... I'll tell you... I'll tell you where the forest is. Satoshi and his friends's journey to enter the Johto League continues. They're at a harbor on their way to the next town. The ship's departure time is nearly at hand... but Satoshi and Pikachu are late as usual. That Satoshi! Where did he go?! Go, Crobat! OK! I'm Satoshi from Masara Town. I'll battle you! I never run away from an opponent! An Alligates? I haven't fought one of those yet. All right! Pikachu, go!

Really? So you're trying to become a Pokémon Master, huh? Yes. There are a lot of Pokémon in our village's forest, at the upper stream of this river. Please take us there, Mr. White! Sure. We'll transfer onto my boat. Follow me. Thank you very much. Just now, was that... a Pokémon? You're a lucky one. You saw a rare Pokémon right away. Is this the Pokémon you saw? Yeah, it looked just like that. It was Suicune. Suicune? What kind of Pokémon is it? Since it's a Legendary Pokémon, nobody knows for sure. But Suicune seems to be the incarnation of the Northern Wind... and it's thought to clean contaminated water. The incarnation of the Northern Wind... I want to see him one more time! "You'll see Suicune, when the wind blows from the north." How's that for a poem? Stop, Betobetón! See you guys later. Take care! See you, then. We might see Pokémon even rarer than Suicune. This is so exciting! Wherever you brats go... Team Rocket will follow you. We ain't givin' up till we catch Pikachu! But what am I going to do if my legs get bigger from pedaling this?! I quit. Don't stop! Mr. White... It's all right, it's all right. Here we are. Where? Look closely. A tree house! This is our village, Ateno. Wait right there! I haven't seen you around. Are you going into the forest? Yeah... Please listen to what my grandma says. Yes, of course! I myself am trying to be the best Pokémon Breeder in the world. I'm Takeshi. I see... Would you please give me your name? I'm Miku. My grandma has been guarding the entrance to the forest forever. If you hear the voice of the forest, you must not move. The voice of the forest? It's a legend in our village. If you don't want to get lost in the forest, keep the legend in mind. Got it! See you then. I'm in a hurry. Let's go, Pikachu. Miss Miku, may I invite you to dinner? Yeah, yeah, we're in a hurry... There are many voices in this forest... The sounds of the wind, the trees, the water, and the Pokémon... What's this? It can't be! The voice of the forest?! Over there! Satoshi! Hey! Don't move! Hey, you okay? He's alive! Let's take him to Miku's place. OK. What was that light? Miss Miku! Miss Miku! Are you there? Miss Miku! Looks like he's coming to! Hang on. You okay? I won't give you Celebi! What's your problem?! Stop! Calm down! Calm down, you two! What's wrong with you?! What... what happened? I'm the one who should be asking that! What's going on? This kid lost consciousness in the forest. You're the boy from back then... Thank goodness! Thank goodness... Do you know this boy, grandma? Remember when I told you about a boy who disappeared 40 years ago in the forest? No way... This is him? No mistaking it. You're the girl who gave me the bread? This was lost in the forest. It's yours, isn't it? It's mine... You must have traveled through time. Traveled through time? What do you mean? This boy jumped across forty years of time and appeared here. No way! Celebi... where is he?! Celebi? Wasn't there a Pokémon with me? We didn't see one. Did you meet Celebi? Yes. Did you meet Celebi? Yes. Celebi is the one who we call "the god of the forest." The forest's guardian god, Celebi, gives life to the forest and has the power to time travel. He came through time with his power? Most likely. Celebi is said to live in the Lake of Life deep within the forest. But no one has ever seen him time travel. Celebi's injured very badly. I have to go save him! I'll go with you! - Me too. - Me too. I'm Takeshi. I'm a cool Pokémon Breeder. I'm Kasumi. I'm the world's most beautiful girl. I'm Satoshi. I want to become a Pokémon master. And this is my partner. I'm Yukinari. We've really flown a lot today... Why do we always end up like this...? But where are we anyway? I dunno. Is that... That's the brat boy! What luck that he came to see us! We're still lucky. Pikachu! Over there! The Pokémon are gathering together. I'm coming too! They're even better than Mankeys. Why don't you wait down there? No, I'm fine. It's my responsibility because I couldn't protect Celebi. You're a good guy. But don't overdo it. Is this Celebi? Yeah. Come here. He must've done that! More than a Mankey, he looks like an Okorizaru... (okorizaru = lit. "angry monkey") That was dangerous! What the... Celebi... Don't, Pikachu! Celebi got hurt because a hunter attacked him, so he's scared of us humans. I see. OK! Celebi, it's OK. We're on your side. It's fine if you don't understand. We just want to be your friends. That's right. Let's be friends. Celebi? It's all right now. He's very weak. Let's get him to the Pokémon Center! What's that?! If you ask us about "this" or "that"... Or answer will be "world compassion!" To protect the world from devastation. To preserve world peace. To denounce the evils of truth and love. We're the lovely, charming villains. Musashi! Kojirō! The Team Rocket duo that soars through the galaxy! Like a white hole, a white tomorrow awaits us! Somethin' like that. We're in a hurry, so if you'll excu... It's okay. Wait, stop right there, brat! Don't ignore us! Hold your tongue. Hang in there, Celebi! We're almost there! What? Leave that Celebi right there! Who are you?! You don't need to know! Who are you?! You don't need to know! Get out of our way! What's that? He'll snatch away our catch! I won't let him! A Bangiras? But something's not right... Destroy them! He's coming! Kasumi! I won't allow you to snatch away what's ours! Who are you people? That mask... you're... You're one of the evil Pokémon members... the strongest executive staff member of Team Rocket... The Masked Lord Vicious! Are you in Team Rocket? Please forgive us for our extreme rudeness! We hear wonderful things about Your Grace all the time. I am deeply honored to meet you. Go! Satoshi, wait. Kasumi's leg is... Sorry, I hurt it back there. We're in trouble... Something's coming! Who are these guys? Our pursuers, I guess. Alright! I'll handle them. Takeshi, I'm counting on you. I'll fight too! Bayleaf, use Razor Leaf! Bayleaf! Satoshi, only one is real. Don't be tricked! Bayleaf, focus! You'll see which one's real! Nice going, Bayleaf! You did it, Satoshi! I guess. I've been taking care of them well. Here they come, Yukinari! Lizard, Headbutt! Your Lizard's doing well, too. Thanks, Satoshi. This is going to be interesting. They're good enemies. Which way to the village? This is bad. We can't help it. Going forward's better than staying here. A Ringuma! What? I guess he wants us to follow him. Let's go. Yeah. Is this the Lake of Life that Miss Towa was talking about? Here? Yukinari. Celebi seems to be feeling great! He really does! The Lake of Life... I get it! This water healed Celebi! Celebi! All right! Hey! Satoshi! Yukinari! It's healed! Celebi... The village's over there! They're delicious! We can eat these! Yummy! Delicious! I'll take some home as souvenirs. Thanks, Celebi. Here you go, Celebi. The sun's not up yet... Oh, did I wake you up? You're really good at that. I like to sketch portraits of Pokémon. Can I see it? Sure. It's drawn really well. It's like a selfmade Pokémon Guide! Are you going to become a Pokémon Trainer in the future? I don't know yet. That's why I was traveling... And then, when you wake up you're in the future... I'm sorry! I... I didn't think about your feelings. It's all right. But... I feel like I'm still dreaming. I guess so... and I guess my mother's worried about me... it makes me... kinda... Your mom, huh... What about your mother? Does she worry about you since you're on a journey? My mom... probably... she probably is worried. I get hungry when I think about Mom. That reminds me... This is the bread that Miss Towa gave me 40 years ago. It's really old-style! It's delicious! Yeah! It tastes like it's freshly-made. What's wrong, Pikachu? Satoshi, look over there! Amazing! I'm sure you'll be able to go home. To your time. The village is just a little further. What?! If you ask us about "this" or "that..." Our answer will be "world compassion!" Team Rocket! Now, hand over that Celebi! It's no use! Celebi! Celebi is mine. Celebi! I caught Celebi. Stop! Fool. What?! Celebi... Celebi is mine! Satoshi! Who are you? Do you want to save this Celebi? The Celebi you knew is no more... I'll show you! Celebi! Get rid of them! What happened? Celebi's an evil Pokémon now. Wonderful! You're wonderful, Celebi! Now, please show me more of your power! You are the most suitable Pokémon for me! Celebi! Isn't this a bit much? What? What? No... NO!!! This really sucks! What's that?! What happened? Miku, we should go. Right! Celebi... We've got to get out of here! You can't. Don't move. Hey! Satoshi, Yukinari! Is everybody alive? Miss Miku! And Miss Towa, too! How terrible... The forest's god is destroying it... How could this have happened? I wonder if Musashi is alive... She has a lot of luck. Lord Vicious, could you help me get out of here? I need a person who shall record my great power. Record? Musashi, take a good look at this... I'm looking, but... the power which I have obtained. Celebi, destroy! I understand! I understand Celebi's power very well! You've tested him out, so I think you should hurry and deliver him to Master Sakaki! I have the most powerful Pokémon. No one can do anything against me. What do you mean by that? Because I now own Celebi, I won't be tied down by Team Rocket any longer. I'm the only one who can rule the world! Oh no... Celebi has to be in there! Celebi! What an eyesore. Celebi, destroy them! Celebi! Here it comes! Is everyone OK? I'm fine. I'm alive. Me too. Grandma! You're supposed to take care of old people! We have to stop him! We ain't any good at this... Musashi... Pikachu, use 100,000 volts! (Thunderbolt) Celebi, shut them up! Do it! Celebi! Satoshi! That's... The incarnation of the Northern Wind! Suicune! Will you lend us your power? Then please take us to where Celebi is! I'll make Suicune mine as well! Bangiras, do it! I won't let you! Go, Iwark! Celebi... Celebi! Well done, Iwark. What a nuisance. Celebi! Be careful! Satoshi, Yukinari! Please! Suicune... Good. Do it, Celebi! This is what happens to those who defy me! Hang in there! Celebi's up there. Thanks! Thanks. What are Kojirō and Nyarth doing?! Please stop, Celebi! You're not the kind of guy to do things like this! Celebi! What are you doing?! Kill them! Celebi! We're friends, aren't we? Aren't we friends?! Please remember! Celebi, remember who you really are! What's wrong, Celebi? Celebi... Celebi, it's me! Please remember! I believe in you! Celebi... Celebi, please go back to being who you really are! Celebi! What?! Impossible! This can't be! Celebi! You did it! Musashi... Thank goodness! Good job! You really did it! What's wrong? Celebi... Celebi is... The water! Put him in the water! It's no good. Why not? Because he destroyed the forest, the Lake of Life is also dying. No way! Suicune has... Hey! Suicune has the power to clean water, doesn't he? Suicune, please clean the water of this lake! He did it! Is this Suicune's power? Celebi, here's clean water for you. Is it no good? Celebi, don't die! Here's that berry you like. Eat it. Come on... eat it. Celebi... Please eat it! It's not Celebi's fault... A human controlled Celebi and destroyed the forest! It's not Celebi's fault! So why... So why should he... Why should Celebi die?! What's that? Time travel... it's the sound of time travel! The forest's guardian god gives life to the forest, and he travels through time. Celebi has a lot of friends! So do we. Celebi! This is mine! I won't let anyone have him! I won't let you get away with this! Satoshi! Let go! I won't let you get away with this! (Thunderbolt) Pikachu! Use 100,000 volts! What are you doing?! Pikachu! Celebi! Pikachu! Satoshi! Pikachu! Satoshi! Since you're such an idiot, I'll discipline you!!! Nyūra... Hassamu... Huh? Gone... I... I'm sorry! Please forgive me! The forest doesn't seem to forgive you. Suicune, thank you! See you again, OK? He's trying to travel through time. He can probably take you back to your time. Will you take me there? Go, Yukinari. Satoshi... Anywhere, any time... we'll always... always... be friends. Thank you, Satoshi... and everyone! We'll always... Yukinari! Goodbye! What's wrong, boy? You okay? I had a dream. A really good dream. Amazing... I don't feel any pain in my body anymore. This lake must be good for your body. Hey! Musashi, we're here to save you! Climb aboard! You're a bit late, you guys! We were hidin' 'til they were gone. What do you mean by that?! What's with this water? Yeah, really... Isn't it? Somehow, this feels really good! *ishi korowoikutsu kette* "How many rocks did I kick?" *kaeri michi no kazoe uta* A counting song on the way home *tōmawari shite kaerō* Let's take a roundabout way to go home *yūhi ga mieru to koro made* Where we can see the sunset *tenten naran'da shiroi kumo* White clouds arranged in a line *hora ten-ten yukkuri akaku naru* Look!
