In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Everyone wants to be rich it's what everyone wants. Everyone wants a life without hardship it's also what everyone wishes for. People are never satisfied. One black Ferrari is not enough they want a red one too. If the only goals in this materialistic world are to satisfy desires and have extraordinary riches what else is there? If the thirst for these things is limitless what is the point of life? Why do we live? My life has always been miserable. What do you mean my son is special? Your baby has disorder behaviour Because his sensory organ has complications but you only have to wait for 2 to 3 years, that's all. Aiman bring your drawing here. Why is your tree blue? How can a tree be blue? Didn't I tell you to colour it according to that picture? - Why not? - Because trees are green. Why are trees green? So stubborn, always talking back to me! Miss, please answer the question for the whole class Why are trees green? What a stubborn kid! Trees are green this is because of pigments in chlorophyll that absorb the blue and red light from the sun the combined absorption of the red and blue wavelengths will result in the colour green Aiman, I heard your teacher scolded you. Did I ask the wrong question Sir? No, you didn't. In life, you have to question everything. You get it? Dad, why doesn't God give us the things we want? Lots of money, big cars, big houses. How could there be poor people? Aiman! Who taught you to speak about such things? Dad, please don't! That's enough! Why are you hitting him? It's an unfair world. The older you get, the less fair it seems. Reality is challenging and it can be hateful deceitful and sinful. This world can destroy people's hearts with darkness. I don't get it, why is the world unfair? Why do we have to suffer? I have so many sensitive questions that I can't voice out. Why? Corruption deception conspiracy illumination This is what I see... Did you do Fajr prayer today? Yes. Where are the bills? What? RM 300! I've asked you many times to save electricity! Look, I don't want to argue with you but I'm the one that has to deal with this, not you. What's this drawing? - May I see it? - No, don't touch my stuff! What the hell? What a troublesome father! Can you stop causing trouble? This drawing is important to me, you know? Darn you! Welcome, Datuk. How are you? I'm fine, thank you. - Aiman, please show Datuk around. - Please, Datuk. - How are you, Datuk? - Fine. - How's your business? - Very good actually. Datuk, not this one, I think they misplaced the drawings. - Hold on, Datuk. - This is extraordinary, Aiman I can feel the beauty in this piece, right here. Really, Datuk? Yes. Thank you. How much? RM 25,000 - Boss, are you looking for me? - Yes Aiman, take a seat. I've got some good news and some bad news for you. The bad news is, this gallery will soon be shutting down. - Why boss? - People aren't interested in art any more, neither am I. Actually, I want the business to continue, but am forced to shut it down immediately. What? Why are you doing this to me, boss? Haven't I treated you and this company well? Fine, it's your decision but you must pay me three months salary in advance... Here's the good news Two months ago, you borrowed RM 6,300 for your mum's surgery and you haven't paid it back Once you've signed this agreement, you won't need to pay back the money as it will be taken out of your termination pay, so we'll be square. Boss, please don't do this to me... I don't have any money saved and it's already the end of the month. Boss, I beg you, please don't do this. Why are you so worried? There are plenty of job vacancies out there! Sign. - How dare you! - Aiman! What are you doing? Ouch! It serves you right! Aiman! Sign it, what are you waiting for? Do you have any job vacancies? I am unemployed now. Insurance? Are you sure I can earn that much in a day? Hey! Have you prayed? I'll call you back. - Where are you going? - To my room, to pray. - May peace be upon you, sir. - May peace be upon you too. Do these things belong to you? - Yes. - I'm sorry, we have to confiscate them. What's wrong? I'm just earning my living. Sorry sir, this is a public area - and what's more, you don't have a permit. - Please have mercy. - Go away! - Calm down, sir, we're just doing our jobs. Let go of me! Don't mess with me! What else? I've had enough... Hey! Hey! I can't find a job. You think it's easy to find a job in KL? The local council has confiscated my equipment. Insurance? Unlike you, I don't know anyhing about insurance. I'm not suitable. No, I'm not interested. Hey, I said I'm not interested. Hey, I would rather die than become an insurance salesman, understood? Our company offers more benefits compared to other insurance companies. Sir, no worries, we will always protect your business. Are you sure you can pay out if anything happens to the company? Such as fire or theft. If there are police checks, can you cover our company? - Police checks? - Calm down Our company will protect your business 100%. Our company is more than capable. Don't worry. Thank you, bro. This is how you make money. The more customers you get, the more money you make. From now onwards, stop your job as an artist, do this, it's simple! - Thank you, bro. - You're welcome, Aiman. Do me a favour. What's this? These are my customers' forms. Can you help me to settle them tonight? The boss wants it tomorrow morning. I have to take care of my mother. It's 6PM now. Alright, I'll help you. - Really? - Yes. That's what friends are for. Remember, by tomorrow morning. Dad, I'm working overtime. I'm still working. Alright. What else, dad? Didn't I tell you that I'm working right now? If mum is not feeling well, then give her medicine! - Aiman. - Get away from me! I'm fine. Calm down. Calm down? Mum has already passed away! And you tell me to calm down... (A WEEK LATER) This chain is tough. Try harder, you sissy! Is it hard to cut the chain, no? If we find anyone inside, kick their butts. You think this is easy? Then you try it! You shut up. Try harder! Hey! Don't run! Answer my call! Aiman What's wrong with you? Pray to God. You'll never understand what's happening in my life. Why? It's OK. Go and pray first. I don't want to. You've been asking me to pray since I was little. When I was little, you would hit me when I did not pray! I'm an adult now. I'm now the man of the house, I'm the one who takes care of you! How dare you speak to me like that? I'm your father! It's a sin to say such things to your father! That's all you know? Sins and consequences? - How dare you! - Come on I dare you! If you want me to leave this house now, I will! I can just leave, I don't care. You know why? I'm sick of taking care of you! From now on, you can take care of yourself You will die all alone in this house! What are you doing here? Haven't you got some place else to be? No, I needed a break. What are you doing here? I'm curious Why has my life become like this? I have so many questions that need answers. Our lives have been pre-destined by God. You don't have to explain it to me, I understand it But I just don't understand why. I'm sure you'll find the answers you're looking for soon enough. But before you can find them, you should respond to His question first. Question? What question? Aiman, what you go through in life, the tests and everything else are questions given by God to you. You just have to respond to the questions peacefully. That's easy for you to say, because you don't know how I feel. I'm tired, I'm in pain. Darn you, Mat Rempit! ... to always be close to God. Have you ever considered that... Shut up! Suffering actually keeps us alive. Dear God, I believe in you. I beg you please rid me of these problems. I want a life without hardship. Dear God, please fulfill my prayers. That's him! Get him! Hey! Don't run! Where do you think you're going? Hey, let go of me! Get up! - Get up! - Hold on, bro. Please! Bro, I swear, I'm telling you the truth I just started work at that company How would I know that the company shut down suddenly! We're in the same boat. I've been cheated too! I'm not convinced! Then what? Hitting me will convince you? Of course! Hey! Don't run! Stop. Hey! Is he dead? Let's leave! Why? Did I do anything wrong? Why did you do this to me? Dad. Aiman. Aiman. Where's everyone? Hey! Hey! Where's everyone? Hey! Hey! Show yourself! Hey! Where's everyone? Where's everyone? Hello! Hello! Where's everyone? Where's everyone? Hey! Where's everyone? Where's everyone? Is Aiman with you? No? It's OK. Thank you. Dad. Dad! Yes, sir? How may I help you? I would like to make a police report. My son has been missing for 2 days. I see. Don't you worry, sir Just wait for a few days. Nowadays, when youngsters are stressed out, they often run away from home. For the time being, we'll make a police report. Hey! Come out! - Yes, PakCik. - Zahid, have you seen Aiman? No. Why? He hasn't come home yet. He has never been like this. We had an argument the other day And he said that he will leave the house I'm lost. Did he leave any notes or letters in his room? Letters? Come with me. Hey! Show yourself! I haven't seen any letters here what kind of letter would it be? Shouldn't you know where he is Since you two were close. Yes, we were close. We met few days ago. I have no idea where he went. Don't worry Perhaps he left a letter somewhere around here. Have you searched the drawers yet? Hold on, why am I sad? These are all mine Everything in this world belongs to me now! All my problems have evaporated! I can't live by myself. We have something we would like to show you But you have to calm down first. Sir Is my son still alive? We are not sure where Aiman is now But I think you should take a look at this first. Aiman? Who is that? Why did he kidnap my son? You have to find that person, Sir. Calm down. The reason I called you here is to ask you something Do you know this person? Have you met him before? No. Has my son been kidnapped, Sir? I don't think so, but it's possible. We're questioning a few suspects. Have you found that person, Sir? We can't tell you yet but what can I tell you is, this case is still under investigation. Where's my son? Where's my son? Calm down. Be strong and be patient. You don't understand how I feel. My wife is gone And my son was beaten up and kidnapped. What should I do? I don't want to be alone, I'm scared. What are you afraid of? I don't have parents, I'm also alone but God is always with me. Let's pray to God. Dear God please protect my son and show me the right path. All suffering is a test from God. Sometimes He will show the right path in the blink of an eye. - Hurry up! Follow him! - God is great! What's the plan? He's coming out. PakCik? - What are you doing? - I want to check out his house. - We should inform the police first. - Inform them yourself if you want! PakCik, we should report to the police first! PakCik, we should report to the police first! Aiman. Hey, let go of me! We have to get out of here! We must find a way out of here! Come on! Come with me, quick! Quick! What are you waiting for? Come with me, quick! What is this place? How did you get here? I have no idea, all I remember is After being beaten up, I woke up in this empty world then suddenly, I was taken to the prison. Prison? Yes, the prison where I saved you just now. I don't understand, which prison are you talking about? What? Didn't you see the other people? The ones that looked like me? I don't understand what you're talking about. Alright, hold on What do you see now? Tell me, where are we now? We are in a garden. This place is totally blank... How can it be a garden? How can it be? Who are you? Are you an angel? Are you from heaven? My name is Maya I've been in this world for a long time. You are the first person I've met here. We were somewhere else just now, why are we here suddenly? You don't know? This world allows us to turn our imaginations into reality. Reality? Aiman. Dad, when did you become good at cooking? I've been searching for you Apparently... - you are here. - Come on, dad, I won't run away from home again. Of course, I am your dad after all. If I left again, I wouldn't be able to eat such delicous food anymore. - Now you know. - You're praising yourself, huh? Who's that? PakCik, they have found Aiman But something's wrong. We have to go now. Slow down. I can't, you know how I feel. You're driving too fast. PakCik. PakCik, slow down! PakCik, slow down, it's dangerous! Hello. They got into a car accident? OK, if there's anything please update me. Sir, we've found him. 10 years ago, my parents and I were in an accident and I ended up in this world. Aiman Are you listening to me? Aiman. Why are you laughing? This place is heaven. Aiman, we have to get out of here. Are you listening to me? You have to tell me how you got here So that I can try to find a way out. What for? Why would we want to leave? I want to get out of here! I've been searching for the answer and it probably has something to do with you. Tell me now, did anything strange happen to you before you woke up here? Does it really matter? It doesn't, only a fool will want to leave this heaven. - This place is not a heaven! - How are you sure? If this place is heaven, we won't be arguing. Fine! You want to know the story of my life, huh? I've had a tough time, I was sick of my life I became really tired of living but I asked God to give me a life without hardship and I think this place is His answer. Aiman, I've been living in this world for more than a decade Trust me, you'll feel bored. - Where's my son? - Calm down, sir. - Where's he? - Lay down first. Is this your son? Calm down, sir. - Doctor! - Where's my son? Dear God please guide me. Give me peace so I can answer Your questions. Please, God. Maya What are you thinking? I'm wondering what to do with you right now. You are the question given by God But I still haven't found the answer. I would like to ask you a question, Maya I hope my question won't offend you You told me that you've been living here for 10 years And I'm sure that when you first came here, you prayed hard to get out of here Because that's what you wanted. My question is, why are you still praying when you're still here? Do we pray to God because we want something from Him or because it is our duty to worship Him? Alright, let's see. Relax, Aiman. Aiman... Can you hear me, Aiman? Look at me. Look at me, Aiman. Great. Aiman, listen I'm Doctor Yap. I know you must be in shock right now But I want you to know that you are safe. Look, I knew this would happen to you But I need you to listen carefully, Aiman, so that you would understand. You have Anton-Babinski syndrome you've had this syndrome since you were born. But you were the first child to survive, it was a miracle! Aiman, this is my father. I guess your father knew him. My father was the one who helped your mother to deliver. After you recovered my father did an extensive research on Anton-Babinski syndrome With the goal of finding its cure. Before my father passed away He told me to continue the research. It's a rare symptom of brain damage occuring in the occipital lobe. Those who suffer from it are cortically blind. You recovered from this syndrome But it would resurface upon significant trauma to your head. I wanted to meet you that day, I've been wanting you to be my research subject But you always looked stressed. I saw you lying on the ground Thank goodness I was there that night. So I brought you back to my home and stopped your bleeding But when I woke up, you were gone. Mostly, this syndrome will happen to the elderly or newborn babies who have behaviour problems. Your mind is still conscious, but clouded by your imagination. That was what happened to you. Your mind will create images that you want to see And it varies with your emotion. This is the CCTV footage. People thought you were insane, but your mind is still conscious You're just living in a world your mind created. You think you are driving a car, but you didn't. During phase 2 When you become sightless, you can still feel real-world objects and movements. But Doctor, I'm curious How could he have escaped from the mental hospital when he is... Blind? When the mind can believe and can conceive, the mind can achieve. Did you know that you brought a female patient with you? Luckily she is fine. Aiman, you went into the forest. God knows what happened there. And the police managed to find you. And here you are. Thank God, you didn't enter phase 3 if not, you would go completely insane. And my father's machine works beautifully to bring you back. Aiman, let's go to my hospital You will get real treatment there. Where's my dad, Doctor? He came into my house, he thought I've kidnapped you. You... Aiman's father? What are you doing here? I thought he was a thief. I found out he was involved in a car accident The next day. Car accident? Where did he go, Doctor? Searching for you. Dad. Aiman! Zahid What's wrong with you? What's wrong with your hand? I'm fine, it's just a scratch. Pain cleanses our sins. Aiman, stop crying Relax. She has been here ten years ago. 10 years ago, she and her parents were in an accident. How did you know that? I saw her in that world. - That's impossible, Aiman. - Yes, Doctor. Does she has the same syndrome as me? No, she has been like this since she was little. No, I don't think so, Doctor I believe she has the same syndrome as me Because I saw her in that world, and I talked to her too! That's impossible, I've been studying this syndrome There's no way you can communicate with other people, even he or she has the same syndrome like you. Those are just your imagination and projection in your mind. Can't you use the same equipment you used on me to treat Maya, doctor? I don't have the authority to do that I can't just use the machine on anybody I need proof, Aiman. Aiman, calm down. Come on. Don't worry. Aiman, have a seat. How do you feel now? Calm down, alright? This is just a side effect of the treatment. Aiman, you must take this pill If not, you will go back to that world of desolation. Just let me go back there again, Doctor. I want to see Maya, I want to save her. I want to prove to you that she is not insane, she's the same as me! Aiman, you can't just simply go to that world again and come back without any complications Once the machine cured your system, and that's it. I don't know what could happen if you go back to that world again You could possibly go blind forever. Fate has brought us together If not for the purpose of me saving her. Do you believe in God, Doctor? Sorry, I have to bring the police in case things go haywire. Why'd you choose a field? Because it is wide and free. Okay, I got the machine with me, so what's your plan? Doctor, leave me and Maya here. When I give you the signal, activate the equipment. But, what's your signal? Great! Aiman. Impossible. What's wrong? Long story. Let's go back to the real world Then I'll explain it to you. - Real world? - I've found the way out I came back here to get you out. This is all the product of our imagination and emotions. But before getting you out of here, I need to prove to everyone that you are not insane. Insane? No, I'm not. Trust me, Maya. You won't understand right now. Why do you want to help me? Because you are the question from Him, and I'm answering it. Answering the question from Him? Outstanding. Who are you? Who am I? I'm your darkness! Your hatred and lust! Why should you change because of this stupid woman? Yes, I want to change because I realise that this place is not a heaven, but a test. I have to accept it, and be loyal to God. The answer of life is to live for the afterlife. Fine, that's your decision But I'll kill you so that you can't repent! May your sins break you! You won't be able to kill me. Really? We shall see. Aiman, what are you doing? Aiman, stop it! You can't run away from me! - Hey! - Aiman, hold on! Aiman, stop right there! Somebody stop him! Aiman! Please stop right there, Aiman! Aiman! Aiman, stop right there! You can't run away from me I'll be with you till the day of judgement! Forgive me God. What's wrong with you? You still want to rely on God? You can only... You can only provoke my brain - This is all in my head. - Then I'll blow your brains out! God, I surrender. What do you think happens when you surrender? Don't you remember your miserable life? These are all tests by Him. Your life is full of problems, even your dad never understood you! These are all tests by God. What are you waiting for? Question Him! Blame Him! Plant those feelings of doubt in your heart! Aiman! Dad... Dad... Dad, please forgive me. I have forgiven you... All the praises be to God, the Lord of the Worlds. God, I accept it. Today, we have found a cure for Anton-Babinski Syndrome. Maya has fully recovered. Fate has brought me and Maya together. We are blessed with a child and my hard work is blessed with sustenance from God. The equipment cured Maya But, side effects of the equipment have rendered me blind. May peace be upon you, Aiman! - May peace be upon you. - May peace be upon you too. - Your baby looks healthy. - Thank God. Business is good. Thank God. - Aiman, let's have a seat first, I'm tired. - Alright. Have a seat. Aiman, do you remember when we talked about... The answers? Have you found them? Yes for now. What do you mean? As long as we are still alive we will always be questioned. These questions will persist long after we are dead, we will find the answers in the afterlife. Guidance will always be offered to mankind it's up to us whether to accept it or not. Luxury and happiness are only temporary those are tests as well But, the place where you can find real happiness, is heaven. Aiman, enough cyring. I was just curious... Aiman, if the world is full of wealth and without hardship then where are the tests? Life is a test, my dear. If we accept this test with peace in our hearts if God is willing, you will eventually find real happiness. It's fine, my dear. I could see things back then but in actuality, I was blind. Now that God has taken away my sight, I see things with clarity. I thank God. There's one quote in the Hadith Rasullullah S.A.W mentioned there will be a time where man adheres to his religion as if he were grasping a hot coal. I hope God will give me the strength and patience to face upcoming tests. What matters is I will start every action every step with... In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
