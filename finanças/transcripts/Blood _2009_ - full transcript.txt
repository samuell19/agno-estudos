Sure Sir Why'd that hotshot detective get sent here? Mind your own business and get back to work Damn, it's hot Miyako... Rozmberk... Miyako Rozmberk was the employer of the victim I hear she's got some Czech blue blood in her Been 14 years, huh? She was gorgeous then I was assigned to the cold case squad where I did nothing Special Investigation Unit my ass So I decided to eyeball a case before the statute of limitations expired Setagaya Maid Murder Case: Information Wanted A maid was iced in a mansion in Setagaya ward Investigators suspected someone in the house But everyone, even the other servants, had solid alibis The case went cold and was shelved three years ago Setagaya Maid Murder Case: Information Wanted Any help is appreciated Justice for our daughter The mansion where it took place is gone, replaced by an empty lot Oh, yeah? The vic's parents were still handing out leaflets nearby Did you meet them? Yes They wondered what the police has been doing for 14 years The mother was crying There isn't much time before the deadline! For their sake, we need to sift through the... Shut up! Hoshino Sir? Why do you think you're stuck here with me? It's so you can cool it while I keep an eye on you Anyway, did you check out Miyako's current location? I have the address Just keep it on the downlow Sir... Now get outta here After exposing some bigwig politicos for corruption, I was booted from the Public Security Bureau Some things never change Some crimes go unpunished What's the point of being a detective now? Dammit Excuse me, but is Miyako... uh, is Miyako Rozmberk home? I'd like to ask a few questions You traveled quite a distance What brings the police here today? My apologies I'm Detective Hoshino from the Special Investigation Unit This is wine! I can't drink on the job May I have water instead? She's deaf Oh, I see I apologize So, how may I help you? I came here today... to talk to you about the murder that took place... at your former mansion in Setagaya 14 years ago I believe I've already told everything I know Besides, I prefer not to remember that time Of course, I understand However, the victim's family... I've already provided as much financial support as I can No, that's not what I mean See, the case is about to expire Expire? Right It's my job to investigate unsolved cases before they expire I want to perform my duty until the very last moment The very last moment? Yes Such familiar words... Actually, I know who did it Ukyo Kuronuma Ukyo... Kuronuma? That's his present name, anyway His present name? But why would you come out with this now? You don't believe me? It's not that But would you happen to have any proof? You should check yourself You're a detective, right? From: Takita About Ukyo Kuronuma: He's 33, from Tokyo, no prior record He runs MZA, a hedge fund laundering slush funds But you won't ever see his face out in the open Let's check this out Mr. Ukyo The VP is finished I hope you enjoyed yourself Thanks to you, I feel decades younger Sir, I've received some rather intriguing information from him Anyway, I'll come again Where am I? Let me go No... Let me go! Please, let me go! Sir Everything is ready Help me What's going on? No! Awfully rude of you This is the owner's private space Why'd you do that? Are you guys even human? Ukyo! Ukyo, you bastard, you killed that girl 14 years ago just as you did now, huh? 14 years ago? What're you talking about? Who'd you hear that from? From Miyako Miyako Rozmberk Is something wrong, sir? You little... Still human, I see What? It means you're mortal You can die... without knowing eternity Dispose of him Yes, sir Hey, wait! Seems you were quite the detective Sad to see you go You? It can't be! You're finally awake You've been reborn Now, you can converse with your heart What happened to me? We now share the same blood, you and I You'll roam in eternity, feeding on the blood of the living That's your life now Eternity... You're a special one, able to receive my baptism of blood Special? Those who receive our blood will die except for certain people with a special type of blood So I'm... one of those exceptions? Yes I found out the first day you came here It's been 1 60 years since I've met a man with this blood 1 60 years? Is this some sick joke? Accept your fate The more you resist, the longer your suffering You blessed me with sacred blood... I have no words to thank you So who is it that managed to toy with a man like yourself? A girl with blue eyes Blue eyes? She may have the same blood as us Why does Ukyo... continue to take the blood of young women? He loathed seeing me partake in other men For me and my body... to survive time, I need a large amount of blood He couldn't bare it and became unhinged Refusing my blood, he took blood from my maid... and disappeared I want to perform my duty... until the very last day Have you spilled enough innocent blood? You're one to say, after the thousands of lives you've taken I wish... you would've let me die that day Anyway, mind telling me why that detective came here? He showed up at my door hoping to solve the case from 14 years ago That's all it is Don't tell me... that he's your new... He doesn't suit you He's too straight Probably Reminds me of you After I left you, I was a mere shell of a man It was but a blink of an eye for us Not for me I'm still... You... You need to find your own path Just forget about me Soji... You belong to me, Soji I've forgotten that name already Brigitte! Brigitte! Hoshino ran away Don't worry So he was planning to murder the Vice President, huh? Quite the vicious detective you had stashed here Inspector Hoshino? That's me Please come to the station Why? You're under arrest On what charge? What the hell's going on? Dammit Shit! Stop! Still human, I see It means you're mortal You can die... without knowing eternity You'll roam in eternity, feeding on the blood of the living That's your life now Dammit, you've got the police under your thumb, too? The men upstairs have a weakness for money and women Who can blame them? It's rotten Everything... Rotten, exactly The country, the people... Nothing's changed at all And yet, here's a detective following a case... that's about to expire anyway All for some girl who'll die eventually, anyway So what if her death happens to be slightly unfortunate? You bastard For that one girl, her entire world ended All because you killed her You little shit So Miyako made you I need you gone Blame your blood for that My blood? Right, for being born with the same blood as me Erase him, for good Sir, baptize me with your blood, please! Bestow me with the same blood he has! Then I'll snuff him You want to die, Yokochi? Only the chosen can endure our baptism of blood What the hell happened to you? Interested in roaming eternal darkness? Eternal darkness? We're incapable of dying All that's left is to wander through time No thanks Not interested in your stinking eternity Very well Then enjoy your endless despair Soji Don't Soji? I've forgotten that name already You're the one who made me And yet that man is more important to you than me? What the hell am I doing? Can't even catch one little murderer You can't forgive Soji, can you? What about me? If you've committed a crime, then I can't forgive you But it doesn't matter anymore After all, I can't survive without drinking your blood How old are you, Brigitte? Ah, you're 323 years old... What? 323 years old? How time flies I found her in Nagasaki She was born to a Japanese woman raped by a Portuguese man Hard enough being deaf back then, much less a half breed She has the same blood as me, then? No Then how can she keep living for over 300 years? She drinks a drop of my blood with wine, every ten days Then she can avoid aging, and converse with her heart I see So you're a mortal I can't age, I can't die, and no matter how much I battle Ukyo, it'll never be settled Are you hurt? I'm sorry You've become strong Thanks to you No, it's because of Miyako's blood There is one way... To do what? To defeat Ukyo Tell me While he's in a state of apparent death, turn him to ashes before the blood revives him If you seal his ashes in a lead box, his body won't be resurrected Though his flesh may be destroyed, his soul won't disappear The soul continues its existence... in the trapped darkness Forever Catch anything? Nope Hoshino... Been a while You been well? I'm sorry for causing you so much trouble, boss I'm no boss anymore They agreed to call it a resignation, though Still gotta pay off my loans I'm terribly sorry Don't apologize I'm glad I quit the police This way I don't have to arrest you Sir I found our guy You did? Yes A businessman named Ukyo Kuronuma I'll be making contact soon That's great Sir I... A big one Thanks Is this carp? Finally bagged one "Bagged one," huh? You've still got the touch Are you okay? You were saying? I wanted you to know... I'm going to go somewhere far Sad to hear that Take care Sure, I'll see you around Hoshino Don't you die I knew you'd come The cruelty of eternity... The folly of loving another... You taught me all of this I'm not strong enough to endure... endless days of solitude Soji I should be her only victim I can't let a criminal like you get away I need her in my life Yet she chose you, and you won't forgive me So you have to go Wanna start it? You couldn't possibly fathom the futility of eternity How much innocent blood have you spilled? You're just a murderer You're calling me a criminal? That's right You're no different What? We wander eternity feasting on the blood of the living We're both victims I alone can love Miyako Brigitte! Have you no regard for life? You'll understand one day You're just a criminal! Send us... to our sleep... Our eternal sleep Forgive me The soul continues its existence... in the trapped darkness Forever I was... nothing but a pawn... in the eternal love story... of Ukyo... and Miyako Aya Sugimoto Jun Kaname Satoshi Matsuda Sayo Yamaguchi Guts Ishimatsu Kanji Tsuda Executive Producer: Toru Ishii Planning, Story and Screenply: Shigenori Takechi Producers: Tsuneo Seto, Shigeji Maeda and Kazuyuki Yokoyama Cinematographer: Gen Kobayashi Lighting: Noritake Shiihara Art Director: Hiroyasu Koizumi Editing: Seigo Hirasawa and Ten Shimoyama Music: Kiyoyuki Yoshikawa Co-production: Rakueisha Produced by Film Partners Toei Video, Rakueisha, There's Enterprise Inc., Sakura Foods and Aya Pro Directed by Ten Shimoyama
