For example, Vienna dance, or classical waltz. Dislocated back. Who? Not important. It's a three-beat movement with simultaneous rotation around the partner. Jazz instead of classical style is... Oh, Come on! There are three main styles: atomic, Canadian and double Hamburg style. Can we skip the theory? Ok. You're the man, I'm the girl. Hands off! Paw the girls, not me! What should I do? Like this. [music] First of all, what are you doing with your hands? [music] Any chick will hit you if you're dancing that way [music] And, now, with the right foot.

What are you doing in this house in our absence? We`re just dancing. In a country where not even a loud sneeze is allowed, so as not to fall under the penal code ... He's just dancing Still, the article "the worship of the West" has not been repealed. Please, take a look at yourself in the mirror... Even your hair breaks this code. Well, OK... Who is this young man? My Comrade? Why do you think we are so simple? Bory.. This young man has the appearance of secret police. But why do you suspect anybody and everybody? And do you know what's this? And why it's here? These are the necessary things for a man in jail. Uncle Adolf was sent to prison only because of his politically wrong name! And aunt Fira went there... Because she put Stalin's portrait in front of the toilet. But they didn't even explain to me why I was in prison. But these impressions in me ... I'll remember for the rest of my life. But Dad! It`s impossible to live such way! From this locked door, with that damned suitcase! You`re a doctor, you should understand it! It's an endless mental supression, that will lead to the disintegration of personality! Bory What, mum? If you do not feel sorry for yourself, then at least have pity on us, with father. Son, aren't your pants too tight? And you have tried this stuff... Gel, before? All of a sudden rain... Or a street sweeper... And..it'll tumble down. Mels. What? Are you crazy? About what? Crisis occurance in the U.S. economy. Who are you? Are you going outside like this? Of course. Unloading wagons at night will not be in vein. Father, tell him! Well what? I like it!

If it doesn't work out, it's not my fault. There's a Dandy. He's asking for a saxaphone. Hello Good Day. How old are you, young man? Twenty. And you still don't know in what amasing country we live? Bayan is permissible, accordion is not permissible Clarinet is a correct instrument. And sax is equated with a cold steel - a gun. Come back in 10 years When jazz will be played on morning perfomances in kindergardens.. And then we'll speak. Listen, I understood you. But I need it now. I have money with me. Mamba and Twist, Jimmy, Foxtrot and Tango I played them many times in my life I'm a captain, a very high rank. of a rotting boat, named, "Jazz". It's better if it were a submarine in this country.

I'm going. Go away, away! Go away. Stop taunting the animal! Come to my room I'm coming So, Fedor, I call you every time before we're coming back, right? And do you have enough time to tidy up the house? Yes. So can you explain why in my office... Did I find this "armour"? Hmmm? Betty.. I'm sorry, dad! I understand it's possible to leave a hair-pin, or scarf, or..virginity eventually. I'm sorry. But how could she go without a bra, I can't understand. One time, Fedor, your mother could find it. And I'll have the problems. Me, not you! Understand? OK I'll check everybody myself. Hold on. I need to talk to you. Did you take? Are you crazy. I'll kill you. So let`s talk seriously Hide it! Fedor, I always speak as a minister, and I try to influence. You will go to USA for practice... Where? To America? Hold on. I want you to understand that it's not a pleasure trip. This is a first step in your career. If everything goes well, you'll come back to finish the university. And you'll work here at the embassy. Do you agree? What a conversation, Dad? I asked you! Yes or no? Yes Are you ready to do everything for it? Of course. OK So I have three conditions. Tomorrow you'll change this clown's dress for normal Soviet clothes. Then you'll go to the barber and change you hair style... to the ideologically right style cut And second, tomorrow you'll see your friends for the last time. Sorry for the cynicism, but these are the rules. And you should conform to these rules or you can work in the factory. I used to dance in halls too at your age And, believe me, that your silly hanging out on Broadway... is just a bad made parody on what we had. Infantile diseases have to be had in childhood. And third? Attention, recording is on. Nothing serious. You must marry. Parting with chicks. Take 1. Who? Girls, your part. Only with Betty! What Betty, are you crazy? Betty...

I used to love you selflessly. You showed me the new world, the new Paradise, And you're leaving now without notice. You're going to be a Soviet, common diplomat. As if you've forgotten your past, But we're still waiting for you, brother, At heart you're dandy, the same as before. He doesn't need an American wife! He doesn't need an American wife!

Mels - rise! There was a Soviet student, Mels. And now we see... Dandy - Mel. It would seem, only one letter, true comrades?, is so small. But let us remember, what is in the name Mels. This is an abbreviation of our sacred names. Marx... Engels... Lenin... Stalin. And now, let's think ... What does it mean to carelessly discard the letter "S"? He used to live among us, we were stepping side by side. He was an honest guy, a simple hero, But truth can't be hidden, his hour has come He reveals his savage teeth He reveals his savage teeth. Bound with one chain, Connected by one aim. Bound with one chain, Connected by one aim. You dared to encroach upon the holy of holies, Where are your ideals? You spit on them!
