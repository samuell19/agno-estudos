That's it. - How you doing'? - What's up? All right. Pick it up. Look out. Coming through. You have to tell me where to turn. I knew it. She's not here. Frank! Sidney! I'll try the basement. Don't panic. She's around here somewhere. Faye! Come on out! You, you! Did you ever hear of private property? Just coming for a hamburger, pop. You got a lot of nerve! Get your food somewhere else! Who's that? Take off that hat so I can get a look at you. Here she is. Faye! For the love of Mike, where you been? You scared the living daylights out of me! I did the marketing. Somebody's got to do the marketing. What are you looking at? Nothing, pop. Nothing. Was that Bobby? I think it was Bobby. No, dear, it wasn't Bobby. It was just a man. Now, how about I fix your breakfast? I don't smell no bacon on. Is this Sunday? Monday and Tuesday don't smell at all... ...because Cream of Wheat is instant. And it ain't Thursday. I can smell Thursday all the way back to Wednesday when people put the garbage out. If it's Sunday, we got to walk in the park. Sure. Sid. Why don't you kids come for a walk with us? Sure, Faye. That sounds great. Get off. Hola, Mami. Look. Smell like money? Because it is. He didn't write. Take it from me. I know about this stuff. He ain't coming back. This is the letter you've been waiting for. Come on, you're a very rich lady. Take it! What's wrong with you? Fresh cash money. She doesn't believe me. You could move to Brooklyn. Here. Buy yourself a new saint. You can afford it now. Room service! It's moving day, Picasso! Bee. Don't you even want to count it? They're paying you to move out. Hey, doll. He's not home? How about you move in with me? This place here, it's falling apart. No! Don't! Get-- Bee! Bee? It's us. The "knock-knock" boys. Let's punch it out again, champ. Round two! How's the face, man? You ready for a rematch? Yesterday, we got rough. Today, we got money. Tomorrow, you ain't gone... There, now you got less to move. And here's your prize money. Where are the boys? I don't hear them playing. Bobby! Donald! Donald's all grown up, Faye. He has two kids of his own now. I'm a grandmother, remember? Yeah. Now, sit down and finish your coffee. But where's my Bobby? Get out of my place, you punks! Mr. Riley, it's your lucky day! You, too, pops. Social Security, that's me. Now, you move out, you go to Miami... ...you sit in the sun, listen to Bing Crosby... ...play checkers, bingo. - We don't want any trouble, Carlos. - Hallelujah! - Don't touch it! - Too late, man. She already took it. - You're an angel, Bobby. - I'm calling the cops! - Faye, time for your medicine. - Let Mama give you a pucker. Never knew you had a mother. Buenos dias, señora! Shut up, Benny. You got the idea, right? You take the money and move out, okay? Get out of my way! Let the boy help you. You never give him a chance. Bobby! Stop calling me that! Get them out of here. And you. Stay away from my wife and this building. You tell Lacey his money stinks! You understand? You kill my head, man. Money's not a good reason to move? Okay, here's a good reason. That's right, abuela. Break it up. - Come on, Faye. - Throw him out! We'll talk about it later. Frank! You punks! Take your hands off of me! Chill out, pop. You're going to go bald! You dirty bastards! Take it easy, pops. No! ...at fine stores everywhere. Batteries not included. Lacey! No, you don't! Lacey, you son of a bitch! You're not getting away with it! Lacey, open up and face me like a man! You're not throwing me out! You really think that he'd come down here? Take the money, Mr. Riley. It's our last offer. This is my place! It's all I got. I grew up here, for God's sake! What do you want us to do'? Arrest them. Send them up the river for life. - I'm not scared. I'll testify. - You know what'll happen. They'll have 18 witnesses saying they were somewhere else. When they get out, they'll come after you again. Then patrol the neighborhood, for crying out loud! What neighborhood? What the hell happened? Mind your own business. Wait a minute. I live here. Upstairs. Yeah. I've seen you. You're in Moskowitz' old place. Mr. Baylor, do you honestly think... ...I could recommend this building for historic preservation? Mrs. Thompson, it was in much better shape this morning. I doubt that. Yeah. Look at the moldings. Look, look at the cornice. That's terra cotta. You don't like ornament. All right. Step back here and look at those proportions. - It's got style. It's got dignity. - There's nothing to preserve. This one's still here. It can be saved, restored. We do have a minimum standard... ...that the structure is intact and livable. You don't even have that. People live here. Not for long. Look, if you're so nervous, I'll fix the door. It's not the door, Mason. It's you. You and your fascination with this place. What? I like it here. Of course you do. It's old and depressing. It's reality! This is the '80s, Mason. Nobody likes reality anymore. Why don't you admit it? It's time to quit. Thank you very much. How do you know that? You said so yourself! You said that you were going nowhere. You could do analytic deconstruction, Neo-Geo, hard-edge. But, no, you've got to be the Andrew Wyeth of the East Village. Why don't you go back to your father and sell vans or rec-Vs... ...or whatever they're called. - RVs. But for God's sake, get out of here. To think that I've been telling my friends that it's so cool living with an artist! You never once asked to paint me nude! Stop right here, man! All right! Sorry. It's okay, Frank. She's here. She's been helping. - Give it to me. - I called Donald. He made the arrangements. For what? A funeral? We're going to Jersey. It's a home for senior citizens. You took their money. You took that bastard's money. There's cold cereal in here... ...and a Libby's canned fruit... ...but she won't eat the cherries. And beans. She just loves beans. Frank, where's our bags? It's the Love Boat to Cuba. Shuffleboard and pineapples filled with rum. You know what they do'? They put paper umbrellas sticking out the top... ...so when it rains, it don't thin out the liquor. And here's her Enderol, four times a day... ...after meals and at bedtime, and her HydroDIURIL twice a day... ...and don't forget. I got it. I won't forget. I'm okay. Frank, we're tired. It's not a home anymore. Say goodbye for us, will you? Hell, she won't even know you're gone. Come on out, Faye. Let's do this. Where's Muriel? It smells like cherry cordial, this stuff. Muriel! I'm Muriel now. I'm coming in, Faye. Hold it, I ain't dressed. Get Frank. Frank! Yeah'? Who's that? It's Frank. I'm Frank now. Okay. Put on the red record. We haven't got a red record. Muriel has a red record. Makes the pills go down. Sure. - Say "ah." - No. Muriel and I say "frog." - Frog. .Qkay, frog. My... I'm going to clean up that café, Frank. I'm going to clean it up right now. Well... ...maybe first thing in the morning. You don't have to worry about a thing. Okay? Okay- "Just around the corner "There's a rainbow in the sky "So "Let's have another cup of coffee "And let's have another piece of pie" Did we miss the sunset? Please... ...somebody... ...help us. Frank. Where's the goddamn toaster? Good morning. Island Manor. Can I help you? Hello? Hello ? Faye, what is this? Come on, Tommy, slow down! No. Wait a minute! Those are my pictures! Wait! Would you stop? Stop! Just wait! God. Today they collect the garbage... - Hi. - Hi. It's all right. It's me, 3B. Someone was in my room. Yeah, me too. I think we got elves. - Good morning. - Hi. - Who are you? - 3C. The old Grandey place. Say, have either of you seen my... Come on, dear. Don't be shy. Dear, come on. Let me get a nice big bolt for you. You're tired of nails. Here. You want some paperclips? Come on. Don't move. Come on, Faye. Time to go back downstairs. I'm feeding them. They like this stuff. Here. Our son kept birds. You know, pigeons. Please, Faye. Don't do this. Not now, okay? That's my frying pan. What? - Nothing. - Go ahead. Tell him. - Nothing. It's not important. - That's her pan and my coffeepot. Come on. Come on. No more pigeons, hon. It's time to stop. I said stop that! Frank. My God, Faye. You went into these people's apartments? Not me, them, the little guys. Faye, I need you to be with me now. I need you to be here. I'm here, Papa. I'm with you. Now, what else did you take? I told you, nothing. - It's the little guys. - Skip that. What about this? Where did you get a new picture? It's not new, it's fixed. Fixed like new? - They did a good job. - Who did? I ain't saying. Goddamn it, Faye! It's okay. No harm done. It could be giant rats. Yeah, from Brooklyn, you know. That was no rat. What was it? Who in his right mind stands in a puddle... ...and sticks a fork in a wall socket? Come on, get back. All of you. Come on, now. There, wait there. Wait there. Here. They're shy. They're the fixers. They like to fix things. They have that knack. Dance me around, Papa. Oh, come on, you kids. Put a little Fred Astaire into it. No, they're not toys. You can't buy them at Macy's. The Army told me to call you. Are you missing anything... ...in the way of experimental aircraft? Not a word, not even in the Post. Well, they're robots, right? They're autogiros or smart bombs. They're microchip hovercraft. They're spaceships. You can tell by looking at them. Spaceships? Sure, from a very small planet. Very small. Maybe this is all a dream. If this is a dream, which one of us is having it? Don't look at me. I stopped dreaming along time ago. I'll talk to it. You better be careful. Stop! Welcome to America. Maybe you should try some Spanish on him. Habla español Están perdidos? Don't hurt anybody, okay? Breakfast. Sit down, everybody. Don't let it get cold. I made candy omelets. That looks delicious, Mrs. Riley. Look. It's plugged itself in. Is that why you're here? Okay, that's it. I'm gonna call the cops and make them come. I heard that. You need cops, Picasso? Come on. Call a cop. - Bobby. - Lady, my name's not Bobby. Excuse me. Robert. Mr. B. Shut up! I saw downstairs. Who's been cleaning up after me? Who? Whoever threw that is ruined, man. Hospitalized. What the hell is this'? Whoever's in there, you got big trouble, man. Carlos. Actually, I wouldn't do that if I were you. Carlos, where are you going, man? Let's talk this over! Don't forget to write! Okay, easy now, little guy. That's right. I just want to check for that label that says, "Made in the USA." No, don't. You'll queer our luck. That little guy is the golden goose. It serves you right. We apologize. He didn't mean to pry. He was just being scientific. "GE." This says "GE." This is, was, my coffeepot. Looks like it's been percolated. Who are they, Frank'? What is so special about our roof? Maybe it was me. What do you mean you? Me and Faye... ...we needed help. You think that they're here because of you? The quickest way to end a miracle is to ask it why it is... ...or what it wants. What is your name, dear'? - Marisa. - Marisa. Boy, my memory. It's like the Navy. Coming and going, coming and going. Here's Bobby's little jammies. I bet there's even a few diapers in here. How old is your son, Mrs. Riley? Bobby? Let me see. He just had a birthday. I've got to think. He's got his father's ears. He and Frank don't get along so good. Frank's got a terrible temper, you know. You're going to love being a mother. Faye, come here, quick! - What are they doing'? - Can't you tell? She's going to get hungry. Take it away! It's too short! - Any more? - That's it. Come on, Frank. They're starving. Well, what do you know'? Thanks, Harry. I saw you fight. Harry Noble, the human locomotive. Come on, Harry, say something. Talk to me. Come on, Frank. Get on with it. A tremendous right. Tremendous. Never says a word. Just watches TV. Loves the commercials. It's all we got. Come on. Take it. It's okay. We're neighbors. - Doesn't trust us. - Yeah. Harry Noble. I used to bet on him. He had a hell of a right. You should've seen him. Look out. Flying pot. Ghost in the garbage! Shut up, Benny. Mama's whole kitchen coming to get you. I said shut up, man! Lighten up. We got plans for those people. And you know what? Those people are making plans on their own. They got something hooked up. Man, they're getting organized, and look at us. Somebody's helping them. Somebody's bringing them together. - Yo, Carlos, I see someone. - Give me that! Wave to your mother. There you are. You're a lucky one. She's a darling girl. Are you superstitious? I'm getting there. Well... ...I'm not superstitious... ...but I was thinking about these things and why they came. And... This will really sound silly, but... ...it's like they were watching or listening. - You think they're here because of you. - Yes! So when's the baby due? Two or three more months. I'm not sure. You're not sure'? What does the doctor say'? - I haven't been to the doctor. - That's crazy. - I feel fine. - You got to take care of yourself. My boyfriend's coming. He's going to take care of me. - Your boyfriend. - Hector. He's a musician, so he travels around a lot... ...different places. So, what about you? No more girlfriend'? No, she got smart. Don't say that. She'll be back. - Yeah'? Why should she? - Because. You're an artist. Oh, God, an artist. - Can I come in? - No. - I make a very artistic cup of coffee. - No... I want to go to bed to sleep. I have to take a nap. Did I say something wrong'? No, it was nice talking to you. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow. Mason! Maybe it was for you. What? Maybe they're here, those things... ...because of you. - Give me back my camera, man. - Go chase phenomena, man. - Bust it up, Benny! - Want to do business? Severance pay. Want to see a strange object? There you go, fool! Frank! What's happening? - Tonight's the night. - Already? The fuses! She blew the fuses. There it is. - How's she doing'? - It happened. I'm a grandmother. It's twins! This calls for cigars. - You got any cigars? - Cigars? This is history. Do you realize what's going on here? Machines that reproduce themselves. Spare parts with intelligence. Living hardware. I don't know how you got here, or why you picked us... ...but we pledge allegiance... ...to honor and protect you... ...in sickness and in health... ...in rain and sleet... ...in the best of times and the worst of times... ...so help us, God. What's that? Batteries not included. "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. “He leadeth me beside the still waters." Faye. Faye, this has gone far enough. Come on. Get up. Got to accept it, Frank. It's over. Poor little soul. What soul? Mrs. Riley. Mrs. Riley, it's a chunk of metal. It's nine ounces of canned goods, most of it from your apartment. Now we can really look inside-- Wait a minute. Last night you were so excited. Now they're chunks of metal? You don't bury the most advanced, self-perpetuating... ...machine-tooled, flying clockwork known to man. Mrs. Riley, please! You know, that little tiny, helpless spare part. It got born, and it never had a chance. It could happen to anyone. What's the matter with you? What did I say'? Marisa, wait a minute! Hey! What are you doing? Marisa, wait a minute! Wait up! Would you stop? - Wait a minute! - I'm worried about the baby, okay? I can't help it, but don't let it bother you. It's not your problem. Harry? Where are you going? Stop him! Oh, God, what is it? Harry, wait a minute! Harry! Harry, please! Champ, what are you doing'? Come on, open up. Let's talk about this. You don't have to say anything. I'll do all the talking. What are you going to do with that thing? Gary, Glen. Smells good, pop. You back in business? What does it look like? Ham sand, Miracle Whip, Canadian on the side. Medium rare! Two over easy, English, no toast, and hold the spuds. Burger up. Boy, I'm sure going to hate to crunch this place up. Thank you, ma'am. What's this, April fool'? He's working on it. It's his first day, okay? Hey, pal. Like this. Remember'? Burger up. Now, that's more like it. Look at this. Lefty, hey! Give me that ketchup. - This one? - No, the other one. Oh, yeah, here you go. Thanks. What? What do you mean, "What?" Hey, Frank. Guess what I did. - What now? - I named the little guys. - Flotsam and Jetsam. Isn't that cute? - Yeah, cute. - Be nice, Papa. - I'm always nice. I've got a kitchen to run. If you're not nice, you'll drive them away. Meaning what? I like being a family again. Just you and me, and Flotsam and Jetsam, and Bobby. Okay, Faye. Okay- Carlos. Is this what you're talking about? It's full of junk. It's a storage shed, you idiot. No, it's not. It's full of ghosts, or spirits, or something. They're just trying to make me look bad. You don't need ghosts for that, Carlos. Your time's running out, my friend. Hey, I'm hungry. How about a little service around here? What's great about a place you can't even get a menu? You want a menu, pal? What for? You're going to get the special of the day. You shouldn't even be in here. I'm going to report all you guys. Bobby, have you had your lunch'? Wait a minute. Excuse me. There. Now, what about you? You want to sleep over'? Why don't you call your mommy and tell her where you'll be? No, thanks, Mrs. Riley. I can't tonight. Bobby, you want to go out and play? You ain't going nowhere unless you eat something. You look terrible. Thin. Here. - Come on, lady. You got to stop this. - Eat, for the love of Mike. You're just like your father. I don't know nothing about my father, and I don't want to know. Don't say that. He loves you. Lady, I'm not who you think I am. Of course you are, my little munchkin. I'm learning how Lacey works, how this city works. It's my way out of here. - Where are you going? - Anywhere. I'm smart, I'm talented. - I get ideas all the time. - Of course you do. Why don't you talk to your father tonight at dinner? I'll cook a ham. - You're inviting me for dinner? - You'd love my ham. Oh, my goodness, is that a smile? I think I just saw a smile. Oh, not here, honey. Back inside on the counter. - What the hell is that? - It's them. The little guys. My little munchkins. Stay away from me. You're not fooling anybody. Crazy, my ass. Marisa, open up. Hi. Listen, you are going to stop worrying about that baby. Step aside. Whole-wheat bread. Lots of milk. We've got whole milk, half-fat, nonfat. One baby book. What are you doing'? You don't have to take care of me. I got you these for that special yen. You made me an art collector. He's a new guy, very talented. What does this one say to you? That's my favorite. It's a guy standing in the sun. - Sun'? What sun? There's no sun. - Oh, yes, there is. See, all you see now is the shadows. See, if he moves two steps in any direction, he'll be in the sunlight. I've been looking at it a lot, you know, because it's art. You got to keep looking at it. What? What are you staring at? He's on his way. - Carlos? - Yo, Mr. Kovacs. - Carlos, what are you doing here? - I want one more chance. I got to have this job, you understand? You've been happy up 'till now, right? Mr. Lacey. - This is... - I know who he is. - Mr. Lacey. I gave them the money. - And they sent it right back. Come here. I got a commitment to have this entire block down to grade level. Grade level. Comprende? I can do it, sir. There's no problem, I assure you. In three days, permits expire and legal options go out the window. - I know about options, lot assemblies-- - Interest rates are going back up... ...and I'm paying a demolition crew... ...to sit around in a restaurant they're supposed to be knocking down. Tonight. I'll have them out by tonight. You've had your chance, kid. I've made other arrangements. Don't you worry, Mr. Lacey. I'm going to do it for you. What? - What's so funny'? - You. Your face. You look so serious. Well, this is serious. I'm looking at the real you. And what do you see'? What do I see? I see a mysterious counterplay of light and dark. Hey! All right, great. Give me that back. Those aren't toys, you guys. Put that down. You guys, come on. Stop playing with that. 0h. my God! That's not fair. What's not fair about it? I used my imagination, that's all. And my X-ray goggles. Hey, would you paint some clothes on her'? Hey! iOye, Marisa! Vamos a gozar. Vamos a gozar. Hey! Vamos a posar. Hector. Hector. Thanks. Whatever happened to General Eisenhower'? You hardly see a word about him anymore. It's the little fellow, alive and kicking. Harry. You did that? "We bring good things to life." You know what happens when birds learn to fly. They leave the nest! Marisa? Carlos, you semi-illiterate, Fascist sociopath! You were gone so long, I was leaving you a note. - "Dear Mason." - Not out loud. That's all it says. Well, I didn't know what to write. What are you doing with my paintings? Your paintings. Just because you go... Where's Hector and the all-stars? They're on their way to Chicago. Oh, that son of a bitch. Look, he got a good job. It's good pay. - It's a break, really. - But what about you? I told him to go. Well, you need somebody to draw, right? Can you believe this? I got it. I got it. - This must be Carlos. - No, don't kid yourself. This isn't Carlos. This is Lacey. Carlos! You murdering son of a bitch! Get out of my way. Not this time, pal. - My guys are coming any minute. - Yeah, sure they are. What's this? Everybody together? What, you ganging up on me? Oh, yeah? Come on. Come on! You should stay retired, champ. Stop them, Frank. Stop them! I'll take door number one. Bobby! Bobby! Goddamn it, he's not Bobby. He's just a punk. - Let me go. He's hurt. - Faye-- What's the matter with you? - Bobby is dead. He's dead. You hear? - No! You wish he was dead. Faye. All you do is yell at him and make him feel he's not good enough. Well, look who's talking. Why do you think he's buying that car? To get away from you! We're going to lose him, and it's all your fault. You hate him! Flotsam! Jetsam. Flotsam. Jetsam. Come on out. Don't hide. - No one's going to hurt you. - It'll be okay. Flotsam. Jetsam. - She's scared. - Come on, you guys. - Where are you hiding? - Mason, they're not here. What about Times Square, all the electricity? Or the subway? Okay, I need more line. - Now what? - Now we go home. It's over. Harry, what are you doing'? Harry, what the hell are you doing? Harry! What in the name of God? Okay. Go out. Go find your babies. You are a genius, Harry, 100 percent. "Don't leave home without it." He's back together. Mason, do something. Talk to them. - What should I say'? It was an accident? - We didn't do anything. It was Carlos. Wait! Give us another chance! Harry. Let him go, Harry. Let him go. What the hell you doing'? - Are you having a party or what? - No party, kid. There's no one home. That's because of me. They won't stay if there's no water and electricity. What are you doing here? This is my building. I did the job. I cleared it. You're going to burn the place down. Man, that's bullshit. This is my building, man. They're moving out. What do you want from me? It's too late, all right? What about me? What about you? Okay. If it's got to burn down... ...I'm going to burn it. Hey, what are you... You schmuck, that's evidence. It's got to look normal. Regular! Who cares? We're burning the place, right? Let's burn it. Sloppy. Sloppy. Don't you want to see'? When you do good work, don't you like to watch it? What do you want? We should be across town by now. Bobby, you let him go and get up here this instant. You said the place was empty. - You got to shut it off, man. - Too late. It's too late. Want to get us both killed? It's going to blow any minute! Just get in there. Get in there! My leg! My knee! You broke my knee! That's bull, man. - Get up. Get up! - I can't walk. I'll tell you where it is. Fourth floor, storeroom, in the back. Where'? The storeroom. Now, go! You got two minutes. - Lady, come on! - All right, all right. Supper's nearly ready. Go wash your hands and face and go sit down at the table. See, I knew you'd be coming. I got the ham on. - Ham' No! We got to get out of here. - Don't start that with me. - Shut up! - Bobby! You're hurting me. Gee whiz, Mom. I'm sorry. l... - I just wanted to show you something. - Show me what? My car. - Yeah. Gosh, don't you remember the new car? - The car? No. Let's go. Don't want to miss the big game. Dad's waiting downstairs. You know how he is. - Your father? - Yeah. Good old Dad. What a guy. You're not Bobby. You're not Bobby! - You're not him! Let me-- - Please! God, lady. Don't wake up now. Open the door, you hear me? Open the door! Come on, lady. Open the door! Don't you hear me? You're going to get killed. You're going to die. Come on. Frank! Don't you touch me. Don't you touch me. Help! Frank! Mason? Move back. You heard the man. Get that strap on her. Come on, let's go. Stay back, behind here. Mason, where is she? Where is she? I don't know. For the love of God. Faye! Faye, you all right? Is she all right? - Get back on the sidewalk. - I'm going along. I'm her husband. Go! Hey! Carlos! No! What the hell are you stopping for? That. I don't see anything. It's just junk. Come on, get moving. We haven't got all day. What's your hurry, Kovacs? The building's down. You won. Hip, hip, hooray! Leave the guy alone. How long can he stay there? Look. I want him out of my way. When he moves, we move. Not 'till then. Now, here we are, dear. Just give me your arm and slip it through here. Be a good girl and put this on. Are we going home now? A different kind of home, but very nice. Across the river, in Jersey. You know who's there? Muriel and Sid. Do you remember? I want to go home. We'll be together. That's all that counts. Excuse me. Mr. Riley? I brought these here for your wife. Some doughnuts. Faye. Look who's here. It's Bobby. He came back. How about that? Mason Baylor? Marisa Esteval? Would you come with me, please? Mr. and Mrs. Riley? Fantastic! Unbelievable! I love the whole thing, especially the sconces and corbelings... ...the moldings, the relief! Oh, it's perfect. Hey, it's Harry. They're back, Faye. They're back. Good morning, chief. How do you like it? Mr. Lacey, this building burned last night. - Can you give us an explanation? - Obviously, somebody made a mistake. What are your plans for this site, in view of what's happened? My plans remain unchanged. I think it's a fake. It's prefab, fiberglass. These people are jerking us around. Mr. Lacey, one more thing. If you want me to get rid of these reporters, I will, no problem. You're fired, kid.
