Hello, did you have breakfast? Not yet. Did you? Yes, we did. Would you like to have some bean sprout soup? It's so easy to make. We have all the ingredients. Sounds good. But, my friend's here with me. We're going to take a look around for a bit. Okay, then, see you later. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Why are you two so close? Oh, I interviewed her yesterday. I did it for my script. We had a drink afterwards. Enough. Don't say more. Aren't you hungry? I want to eat something yummy. Will you treat me? Sure, what do you want? Something really tasty. Like spicy rice cakes. Spicy rice cakes? Spicy rice cakes? Don't know if they have it here. Don't think so. Do they sell rice cakes here? If they do, I can cook it myself. I'm really good at it. Really? Let's check out the grocery store. Don't go out of your way. Don't worry, stupid. Let's go down to that sand dune. There's something real neat. What is it? I'll show you. What is it? You see, I got the splinter out. I didn't get it out myself, and didn't know when it happened. But I think it was when I bowed on my knees. You went down on your knees? Yeah, I think that's when the splinter got out. Why did you bow? Come on and see. You'll feel like doing it, too. Why are you laughing? Alright, let's go. Dori! Dori! Dori, you're here. Why is he here? Do you know this dog? Yes, he's Dori. Somebody abandoned him. Do you know the owners? Yes, I've seen them here before. They abandoned him? Yes, I think so. I couldn't find the owners. So my uncle decided to raise him. Really? That's terrible. How could they abandon Dori? That's his name? Yes. We didn't know, so we named him Ocean. Oh, you did? Dori, what's happened to you? Will you keep him? Yes, my uncle is fond of dogs. And he's just a little puppy. That's better for him. Huh? It's better than being raised in Seoul. Dori, are you alright? Do you like it here? Don't you miss your owner? Some owners they are for ditching him. The crazy bastards. You're right. Poor Dori. Dori! He's running faster. Great! Dori. Did you kick me? No, I was just running. What's wrong? I don't know what's happened. It's weird. What's the matter? Are you in pain? I think it's a muscle cramp. Can't move at all. Really? You can't move? No. Dori, come here. Oh no, what shall I do? It's very swollen. The doctor really said you don't need to be looked at? Yeah, he's my relative so he wouldn't lie. He said an unused muscle snapped. We have unused muscles in our body? I don't know. Maybe it's like an appendix. He says it'll be very painful only for a week. Lucky I don't have to go to the hospital. But shouldn't you see a doctor at least once? Is talking on the phone enough? Don't worry. It's for the better. I'm tied down for a week, so I'll just stay put here and write. Mr. Director, you are wonderful. Does it hurt? A little. Damn it, this sucks. Hello. - Did you like the food yesterday? - Yes, it was delicious. I'd like to order the soup again. Sure, but how's the movie director? He's still in pain. - Hope he recovers soon. - So do I. - It'll be ready in a moment. - Okay. What's this? Oh, that? It's a cane. Why? Do you need it? Is anyone using it? We don't use it anymore. My husband used it way back. If you need it, take it. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. - Hello. - Hello. - Want some fried eggs, too? - Yes. How many? - Three. - Okay. Sorry to ask this right after we ate, but did you sleep with that girl, Sunhee? No. Then why'd she stare me down? Did you two talk? That's none of your business. Did you have sex? Just tell me the truth. Tell me. I'm just curious. I didn't. I told you I saw everything. She really just came in and left. Plus, she's married. And I really do not see her as a woman at all. I'm serious. So stop talking this nonsense. - Ouch, it hurts. - Why are you lying to me? Why are you being like this? I interviewed her because she resembled you. I was missing you so much, but you weren't here. So I just interviewed anyone. We don't look alike. And you know how she looks at me? She got this contempt in her eyes. Why would she? She means nothing to me. She's just nice. Actually, I feel sorry for her. Go on, and what else? She's trying to get a divorce, but it's not working out so well. I'm just curious. Tell me the truth. You saw everything. There was no one. Was there? No. Moonsook. And did you hear my confession to you? Yes, I did. I know I'm hopeless, but I'm struggling with those bad images. And, I've got to write a script. I'm using all my mental capacity. This is something I realized a while back. And since I'm fighting with images again, I have more confidence in it now. Look here. Your actions now and my obsession with purity are all images. We're repeating images imprinted on us by others. Look at this. Let's assume that this is the real thing. This constantly changes and has infinite curves. Let's say, for example, here, here, here. People keep focusing on these points. Then, there is an image that recurs. Like so. You having sex with foreigners. Let this be the face of the woman having sex. And this, the image of his phallus. And this, the weird position you'd see in porn movies. When these three images form a set, it coincides with the existing bad image. Then, the real thing disappears and only the image remains. But let's say, that this point here is your happy face after those spicy rice cakes. And here is your nice face worrying about a sick friend. And here is your face sitting on the toilet. If we connect these points, then, we get a shape like this, right? Yes. But this is something we are not used to, so it's hard to grasp. Anyhow, it would still be closer to the real thing than this triangle. So if we continue our efforts, we can overcome this stereotypical and evil image. We can break them, you know. So we have to try to see these other points together as well. You know what I'm saying? You are amazing. How did you come up with this? This is how I'm fighting right now. That's a really good way to look at it. Think so? You really are smart. Hello? I'm sorry, but I'm the person you saw this morning. I wasn't sure if it was okay to go up. Oh, yes. But I think my wallet is in there. I can't find it anywhere. Could you please look for it? I'm down here now at the front desk. Wallet? Where did you put it? Well, maybe on the table or the floor. Or near the bed. I have important things in there. Well, I already cleaned the room and didn't find anything. Hold on. - Who is it? - Huh? Nothing. Sorry, not here. It's really not there? No, I looked everywhere. Well, could you see me down here for a second? Me? Why? Only for a little while. I just want to buy you a nice meal. Alright, I'll be right down. - Okay. - Okay. Where are you going? Who was it? It's Sunhee. She wants to see me. Why? I don't know. I'll be back soon. Take your cellphone. What's she got to say? Yeah, I have my phone. When did you arrive here? You saw me yesterday morning. Sure my wallet's not there? Why do you make me repeat the same answer? I'm sorry. Something very important to me is in there. You wanted to see me because of that? Not at all. Can we spend some time together? You're so beautiful. - You're not serious. - No, you're really beautiful. I envy you. - Please, stop. You're much prettier. - Not at all. - How old are you? - How about you? Thirty-one. I'm older. You are? Then I should call you Big Sis? How did you meet Joongrae? It was just a coincidence. He wanted to have a drink so we did. What do you want to have? Oh, it's my treat. What would you like? Should we go over there to the inlet? I think it's not far. Oh, the inlet? Sure, I haven't been there yet. Well, hop in. This is my car. It's cute. No, it's a piece of crap. Director Kim thinks that you and I look alike. Who told you that? The restaurant owner told me. That man always talks crap. I was flattered to hear we looked alike. But do we? So I thought about it. And I think I know why he said that. Can't really explain in words, but somehow we are a bit alike. The way we talk, for example. Really? You're nicer than I thought. Thanks. So why did you ask to meet? Don't you have a real reason? No. You're just so pretty, and very close with Director Kim. So I just wanted to know more about you. What do you fear most in your life? Obsession. Obsession? I'm afraid of betrayal. Did your husband betray you? Is that why you're getting a divorce? Director Kim told you that, too? Yeah. Yes, my husband betrayed me. That's nothing to cry about. Just divorce him. And live right when you can forget him. And what about you? Why do you cling on to him? I did? Two nights ago. Don't lie to me. Oh, I get it. So you two were in the room then? Were you sleeping together? - Did he tell you he slept with me? - No, I'm just asking. What did you do then? I don't talk about that kind of stuff. I see. But how did you get out when I was outside the door? Ask him yourself. Did you two by any chance walk over me? We came out anyway. So you walked over me? Why is that so important? We got out and that's it. You're mean, Sunhee. Two women shouldn't be fighting dirty over a man. The choice should be the woman's. This is so boring. This is why hell is so boring! Don't get mad. I'm fine. So you really are just a woman. The phone has been turned off. You'll be connected to... Moonsook. Where the hell are you? Moonsook. Lizard, lizard Can do anything Lizard, lizard Can do anything Finished. Thank you. This is good stuff. Real good stuff. Why are you driving me nuts? Know how much I cried waiting for you? You did? I'm sorry. Know how hard it was for me? I was crying on the porch because of you. Let me ask you something. Please be honest. Please. That night, when I was outside, what were you doing in the room? I'm getting sick of this. It's that again? I don't know. Don't know anything anymore. Joongrae, don't lie to me. Please, don't lie. Do whatever you want. What did I do so wrong to deserve this? What did I do? I'm sick of it all. What's wrong with you, Moonsook? That's not important. Somebody walked over me. You two walked over me, huh? When I was outside, you two walked over me. I thought I was dreaming, but it was real. I don't believe this. Walk over me, did you? How dare you? How dare you do that to me? Is this how you're going to be? I was willing to endure all the pain till the very end, but you torture me over this crap? Don't you remember? I told you how hard it is to fight with images! So just give me the facts. Not your bullshit philosophy. You slept with her, huh? Oh, that I know already. Did you walk over me? You and that bitch walked over me, huh? I won't cry. Just tell me. - Then I'll be quiet. - You're completely insane. Tell me, please. Just tell me, Joongrae. No, I can't. I can't be treated like this. I don't deserve this. I just can't. Sorry, I'm leaving. R. The Best Beach on the West Coast, Shinduri - Thanks for coming. - What happened? - Do you have a cigarette? - Yes. There's such a muscle? So there are muscles we can't use. Guess it's like the appendix. That's too bad. You mustn't have worked on your script. - I wrote it. - What? In these couple of days? Yeah, I think it's pretty good. These two pages. How'd you finish so quickly? Amazing. Do you like it? Don't know, maybe tomorrow it'll look like shit to me. But it all came within a few hours. Funny, huh? It came out so easy, as if I were possessed. Yes, Director Kim. How are you? I'm home. Are you still there? How's your leg? It still hurts. I think I was afraid again. I miss you. I'm sorry, too. Honestly. When are you coming back? I think I liked you a lot as a movie director. And I think you'll have a hard time because of me. Please stop. You think so? Should I try to find someone here who resembles you? Like you did? Yeah, why don't you. Don't worry. I won't. I don't repeat things. And I hope I don't offend you, but I don't respect Korean men too much. There are some good men though. Yeah, I guess. Take care of your leg. Hope your script comes out great. I'm sure you'll do well. I really like you. Yes, good-bye. Moonsook. Thank you. It was under the bed. Oh, really? When are you going home? The day after tomorrow. How about you? I'm going now. Hope you think things over well. Yes, I will. I'll be going. Good-bye. My car... We'll push it for you. - We'll push, you drive. - So I have to get in, right? Here we go. Steer to the left a bit. - Like this? - Left. Left, like this? I think it's getting out! - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Is that your car stuck there? We're waiting for a tractor to pull it out. I see, thank you very much. I'd really like to repay you somehow. - Don't worry about it. - But still. It was really nothing. Let's go. - Thank you for your help! - You're welcome.
