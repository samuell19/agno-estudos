- Your turn. - No, it's not. I'm telling you it's your turn. Correct. Sorry. I'm not used to it, plus the camera. Do as if it's not there. Dieumerci's right. - Relax, Little Bill! - I'll smash your face. - Say that again! - It's OK, bloody hell. Shouldn't have started with Omar and Jamel. OK, no need to get upset. Let's start again. There's no camera. As simple as possible. Action! "Is the stroll fine? "Very fine. "Is the day fine, too? "Indeed. "What news? "- The little cat's dead. - What about his pussy?" Super, guys... - Some would like to listen, OK? - Get lost. Stop! Stop! I'm fed up. I come here for free, every day. It's a damn pain! Respect my work. Carry on. It always takes ages with blacky. Carry on. Forget about them. Stay focused. "The world, dear Agnès, "is a very strange thing. - Who threw that? - I did. Have a problem? You OK? What a shot. Who's fault? You make me play Agnès. It's suicidal. That's not the problem. It's always a mess. - What's up? - Bugger off. It's adult talk. I like your performance in Agnès. The guys loved it. They're all wanking there. Will you leave us, please? Be nice. You're doing drama, now? I acted when I was a kid. - I believe you. It's OK. - Who's it? "Mr Belmondo, please stay..." Bugger off! You're a pain. It was good, huh? - Get lost. - You're no good. You're going to enter for the New Talents contest. You're not exactly a leading romantic man, but in Agnès, you were very convincing. Think I can play small roles when I get out? Want an Oscar, too? This contest might be your best opportunity. What've you got to lose? - Denzel! - Hey, crazy. Big brother... We've got a scene to finish. Yeah. Some scene. Don't forget us when you'll be famous. - And photos, man! - Yeah! We'll miss you, still. I won't say see you soon. - Tjambéal. - Tamboli. Gun-toting uncle... Keep it up, OK? I will. Sucy Bonneuil. Dieumerci! A childhood dream Thank you, Lord. You've brought back my son. - Mum. You OK? - Fine. Let me look at you. You look so "skinny". - I'm not. - Got my parcels? - Yes, I got them. - Come on here. The lift needs to be repaired. It's this or I use the hoistaway. Anyway, walking up keeps me fit. Come and sit. The grub will get cold. Yeah. It's good food. Sure. I made it. And this evening's menu for my gentleman: pork sauté. So, how are you? OK, besides my diabetes and cholesterol, you know... You got any mail for me? Daniel was to pick it up. I'm still waiting for him. Talk about a lawyer... - Don't be nasty. - Be careful, though. Mum, I wanted to tell you... The money orders. I'll pay you back. Yes. No problem, son. Nothing serious, I hope. No, it's OK. I got it! Silence, please. - Silence, please! - Come in. - We're late. - Coming? Yes... That was quick. I only called 2 minutes ago. It's for the 8th. There you are. I think you've mistaken. I thought you were the courier. - Alright... - Sorry. It's hectic at the moment, so it's... - Sorry. - Never mind. Take a seat. No... Well, there, you've a chair, there. How can I help you? I'd like to sign up for the contest. - Mr Chenouga has sent me. - Who? Chad Chenouga. He used to teach here. I don't know who he is. But you know, well you don't, but I've only been here 3 months. I'm a dancer actually. I'm a real classic ballerina. I've done it from young. I stopped my studies to dance. But I was told I wasn't graceful enough. It stalled my progress. I had to stop dancing. But I think they were wrong. We must be careful when people say things. Because sometimes, something happens, and it changes you. But I feel that once... we know that we think we have something, it's as though we've got it. I'm sorry I mistook you for a courier. - It doesn't matter. - Sorry. How can I help you? I'd like to enter for the contest. Oh, no, it's too late for outsiders to enrol. What do you mean, "too late"? You have to enrol for one full term, for the contest. You've got it all here. The rates. Wait on... This is the rate for one term? 1 462 euros? Correct. That's for one term. Alright. And when is the contest? In a month's time. Can I enrol for one month? - One term is the minimum. - Yes, but... It's too expensive. - I need to think. - Get down to work, children. It's Mr Ventura, the director. Alright. - Well, thanks. - What are you doing? Well, I'm leaving. You've got some spare time? Gosh... - Gad Elmaleh took classes here? - Yes. There were others, too; Daroussin, José Garcia... - He's real funny. - Very. And Pierre Niney. Handsome Pierre Niney. Cours Ventura's a real institution today. Lino Ventura... "Idiots are so daring. That's how we recognise them." The director's a relative of his. Well, I think so. "You make your own bread, you can't eat the same as... "The bread we make here is not cooked. - "Why are you always..." - Marc? "It's not my request. Marc? - Marc? - Can't you see I'm working? Shit! Sorry. He wants to enter the contest. - Can he attend...? - Give him a seat. Let's do it again. Another try, Jérémy. OK. Come. Put it back. We'll do it again. Come on, start again. Jérémy, I count on you. "A dry piece of bread. It's to make me..." Stop! Jérémy, we're not there. Stop, it's over. You go and work. See you next week. Thanks. Right... Coming on stage? - Me? - Yes, you. Not the door. I don't want to disturb. I'd just come to see... Too late. Come on. - Hello, young man. - Hello. - What's your name? - Dieumerci. - Say again? - Dieumerci. - That's your first name? - Yes, sir. OK. Everybody give a big hand for Dieumerci. - Introduce yourself, young man. - Alright. My name is Dieumerci Saint-Michel. I'm 44, and... I want to be an actor. Can you speak louder? Remove your coat, you look constricted. Great. Perfect. What did you work on? - The school for wives. - Arnolphe, Horace, Alain? - No. I enacted Agnès. - Shh! Agnès? Yes. It was a special context. The tutor, well, the teacher, wanted us to work on our feminine side. Why do you want to do drama? It's a childhood dream. And... from small, I've always liked imitating. That's interesting. Who can you imitate? Can you do something for us? An imitation? Yes. "Can I ask you a question? "When you discovered your wife's body..." - Sorry... - Stop! - OK, Clément? - Yeah. You're early for tomorrow's class? It's not me. I didn't do anything. OK. Fine. So, Dieumerci... imitations... That's why you want to enrol for the contest? - No. - Very well. Then, let's not waste time, because it's coming up fast. You'll work in twos with, er... with Clément. OK, Clément? How's life? Super. You'll work with Dieumerci. Le Cid. Act 1, scene 5. I can't. I'm already doing a scene with Audrey. It'll do you good to work on something else. For the scene at the contest, I need to think about it. Excuse me, but I'm not yet inscribed. Then, go and do it. Can I pay in instalments? No idea. Let me see if Mr Ventura agrees. Hello. I've come for the 8th. - It's OK, we can talk! - No time. - Wait on! - What? What will we do for the scene for the contest? Our scene? Because you think we're ready? Yes. You're not up to the mark, you know. I asked Marc to change classes. Wait on, baby... You didn't get me. There's no "baby", it's over. Pick up your things from my place and get lost! Why're you doing that to me, Audrey? Ask your bitch on Facebook! - My what? - Excuse-me. Clément, right? How do we go about what he said? - I'll call you. - But you don't have my number. - And so? - I'll give it to you. - There. Call me, OK? - OK, will do. - Bye. - Bye. Augustine puts too much syrup in the coconut custard. It ruins the taste. Mum, I must tell you something. Sit down. I'd rather stay standing. I'm all ears, son. Right. Remember what I wanted to do when I was small? Yeah. A fireman. No. An actor. Don't you remember? You used to like imitating people. "Elkabbach! Quiet! It's scandalous!" Well. I'm entering a contest to become an actor. - But what job will you do? - I'll be an actor. - That's not a job. - Yes, it will be. Trust me. "Trust"? In the West Indies, it was the name of a boat that sunk. You know what? They talk too much over there. A fireman? I never wanted to be a fireman. An actor... I don't mind making sacrifices, but where do I find 1,500 bucks? Plus, the school's full of blonds. - You'll manage, Dieumerci. - Yeah. - You'll manage. - Yeah, I will. A childhood dream... Damn! You damn idiot! You scared me! You OK, Jackpot, boy? Fine? - How's Daniel? - Fine. And you? Fine. Hey, you've expanded. What happened to the coffee machine? - It's on the 4th floor. - With the accountants? - Nice tan. - You've still got humour... Anyway, you seem in good shape. You know, I'm so happy to be here. - Thanks for all that you've done. - Don't thank me too fast. - Got the letter from the tax office? - Yes. Here it is. I looked for classes and I wanted to know if... Shh! Wait on... Right. They're in a mighty hurry, huh... Now, it's clear. Just send the tax office 500 euros every month and all will be OK. I like it when you say that. You pay up, all's well. You don't, back to prison. Simple, isn't it? No need to be a lawyer. You're happy to have a lawyer, though. Sign the payment schedule, here. - Got a pen? - There, here you are. - You've spoiled yourself? - It's modern. There. And this is for the divorce. - How's she doing? - Like you. She's trying to move on. - Still at the shop? - Yes. OK, there. A new chapter. You'll be OK. I don't get it. One night and you're gone. I've already told you. I can't sleep here. Between my classes and my temping, I'll be spending 3 hours commuting. Some do it all their life. It's their choice. - Keep in touch, right? - Yes. Don't mix food and clothes! It's horrible! It's a Tupperware box, it's well sealed. Some leftovers of the pork sauté. If you'd eaten everything, I'd have made a colombo. Don't think I'll throw it away! I'll put it in another bag. No... Yes, son. It works to go down, not to come up. It's the social lift. There. Bring me back the Tupperware. Don't forget to buy bread, it's saucy. At the bottom of the bag, there's a small prayer. - A small what? - Yeah, don't make fun of me. You must stop those prayers of yours. - It's a prayer for the actors. - You've got one for lifts? Why're you in such a hurry? Why don't you stay a while? Come on, I'm no more a kid. Stop it! - Anyway, the safest refuge... - Is a mother's heart. - Yes, mum. I know. - I wish you good luck. Dieumerci, you've got an angel in heaven, now. Thanks. Thanks. OK, I'm off. Don't worry. I'll call you. Take care, mum. OK. You played, you lost. Go to your new "friend". That's bullshit on Facebook. I wasn't going to stay with a liar forever. You even lie to your father! Don't talk about my father, OK? You crazy? What did you think? That we'll marry? - Asshole! - What? Don't come crying! - Clément? - Yes? Your bedtime stories! "All the men are liars, "inconstant, false, talkative, hypocrite, "proud and cowards... "despicable and sensual..." What's that? What? It's Alfred de Musset. Hi, man. "The world is but a bottomless sewage where the seals..." - Can I sleep at your place tonight? - No. Come on. Don't be mean. Just for tonight. No. Plus, you owe me money. I'll pay you back. Just tonight. No is no. We're working. I've got him. Take back your dough. C'mon. I owe you nothing. Jérémy? Get a beer for me. I'm coming. Mélanie? Just for tonight... No. Drop it. Plus, it's total chaos at my place. Go to your father's. - Welcome. - Hello. - Can I help you? - Do you rent rooms for one month? - For one month? - Yes. You are very lucky. How much is it? It's OK... Junior suite. Ah yeah, right... I will clean it. All clean. I can put one bed here, two bed... You can put your saga Africa. Your babies... Yes, but I'm alone, sir. All alone. - Alone? No babies? - No babies. - Why? - Because it's like that. Me, five babies. I've got Rechma. 15 years old. Very good. OK. How much? So... For you... thirty euros. But for you, if more people, I give you good price. - Alone. - No problem. Thirty euros. Go and wash. Go and wash. Understood? So, have a very good rest, sir. - No heating? - No harissa sauce! - Hello? - It's Clément, from Ventura classes. Can we rehearse tonight? Yeah. Hi. But tonight...? The earlier, the better, isn't it? OK. Where do you want us to meet? Anywhere. At your place, if you're OK? - Night service, sir. - What? No, I'm joking. Divali, festival of lights. Offering for you. - OK. - All for you. - All for you. - Yeah, thanks. Move on, you! I'll spank you. Sorry, sir. Here, very respectable place. No problem. Thanks a lot. Be careful, a little bit hot, but Black people like chili. Hi, excuse me. I'm searching for hôtel du Square, please. You asked the right person. It's there. - Straight on, then right. - Hôtel du Square is left. - There, I'm telling you... - Stop! - Searching for hôtel du Square? - Yes. Take the first on your right. OK. Er... choukran, then. "Oh, such wrath..." What does that Gandhi want again? - It's you. - Hi. - Hard job. - We do strange things... Then they only give this. Come on in. The Indian downstairs was such a pain. He wanted money. I don't know why, I didn't get it. Sorry, but you've got something to drink? Yeah. Vodka, whisky, champagne? - Coke zero's fine. - OK. There you are. Welcome to my place. Coke zero, it's "zero coke". And so... you live alone? - Yes, I'm alone. - Super. I don't know about that, but that's how it is. I found the book. Second hand. Cool, I had no time. You worked on the scene? I started. But it's tricky. Shit, alexandrines. That's nasty of Marc. "Rodrigue, have you any courage? - Don't stress on "Rodrigue". - Oh, alright, I won't. "Rodrigue, have you any courage? "Any but my father Might test it at this moment." There's a rime that's missing. Yes? Where? "Any but my father... "Might test it at this moment." No. You're exaggerating. There's no rime missing. "Any" must rime with "father". No way. "Father" rimes with "anger". Right? Father, anger. That's the way it works. Let's do it again. "Any but my father Might test it at this moment." "Righteous anger. "Noble pride to all my grief is sweet. "I recognise my blood in you complete. "My youth lives again in your fine ardour." - OK. Yep, that was nice. - It's true it's nice. Come on, let's continue. I don't mind, but I have to wake up early tomorrow. Enough for today. - Really? - Yeah. It's tough, now. We could've carried on. We were all in. I'm temping tomorrow. I have to work. Same time, tomorrow? - Same time, tomorrow. - OK. - Same time, tomorrow... - What? Can I ask you a favour? Yeah. Sure. I meant to take my clothes to my parents', And since it's late, I'll miss the last train. So, I was wondering if I could sleep here, tonight. - Where do your parents live? - Far. - OK. If there are no more trains... - Really? - Yeah. - That's cool. Thanks. I can't believe it... Stop playing on your mobile. I'll call a screw and just you see... - A what? - Nothing. I've got early work. Stop. - Dieumerci? - What now? - Do you smoke? - What? Do you smoke joints? Let me be clear. No joints in here. Sorry. I was just asking. - Good night. - Yeah, that's it. Good night. Man, it's one night. It's just one night. Can't you help me out for one night? "Come son and blood, restore my honour..." The temp! Come here. You talking to me? Everybody, be cool! This is a robbery! "... Might test it at this moment". You talking to me? You talking to me? You talking to me? Stop your nonsense. People work in here! Dieumerci Saint-Michel. - There. - Thanks. I'm rehearsing. - OK. But your boyfriend... - I don't get it! - You must pay! OK! - You saw that with him. What are you doing here? - He must pay. - He wants me to pay. I got that. Wait on. I... help him. He can sleep here. Here, it's hôtel du Square, not Ritz. You pay for the bed but not for the room. Here, you pay all day. - OK, then. Pay him. - No! You invited me. I'm not paying. What's all this racket? No mess! Go back to bed. What can I do if he wants you to pay? I have no money. I can't do barter. Gandhi, how much for him? How much? Jawad. My name is Jawad. For your boyfriend, 30 euros. Come on, twenty, twenty. 50 euros for both of you, because you're a sweet couple. 50 euros... If you problem, I put more people and you, cheaper. Alright? - Give him 25. - No! Give him 25, I'm telling you. I saved you paying 5 euros... Thank you. If you need something.... I can enjoy the evening with my man. No way! There's no Wi-Fi even. - Why're you still here? - To practice. Weren't you supposed to go to your parents, far away? If I'd gone, it would have been cutting it fine. Then let's practice. I'm hungry. What about you? You're not? You know of any folk who entered the contest? To hell with the contest. Yes! Don't you worry. Marlon Brando didn't go for any. Nor did Ryan Gosling. He didn't got to Ventura. How d'you pay your classes? I'm not a good artist there. I've embezzled the money of the uni. - What? - Normally, I should be doing law. I should be a lawyer. It bugged me. But my father, once I'll be a star, he'll go on TV shows... "I thought he was in uni, but he was doing drama. "Already back then, he was passionate. "It's so emotional." Get it? Don't miss it. Rolex, and all. - You married? - Is it an inquisition? It's OK, just asking. Marc told us one day: "Acting means getting to know the other one." You married? Got children? I don't know if I want any. But I'd like to. Once you've got a family, it's a responsibility. Why're you staying in a hotel? If you're paperless, you can tell me. I won't rat on you. I'm not a grass. I won't say a word. How old are you? You Blacks, it's hard to know. That, plus you're good sports people. Where are you from? Dieumerci's African? No, it's from the Antilles. Pani problem. Francky Vincent, dadada, doudou, didon. - Where are you from? - Sweden. Sweden... South of Sweden, then. I don't know what you take, but stop it. I didn't know the area, but it's cool. It's very nice, very lively. - We'll have good fun together. - Yeah... - We'll have good fun. - For sure. You're leaving? No dessert for you? First! - You saw Blue is the warmest colour? - No. I saw it with Audrey. She was shocked. I'm still hungry, you know. There were Moroccan pastries... I'd tasted some in Casa. There were tchareks. And the honey sweet with almond paste. Take one and you're like new. The tea... they must have stocks of it. - Let's practice? - It's OK, come on, one sec. Can't we chat? In the neighbourhood, they're surely selling drugs. What did I say about bombers? It's OK, just chatting. We can't have dessert, we can't talk... - Relax, old man! - Get lost. - What? - Get lost. I swear. Take your suitcase and bugger off. It's not your place, it's a hotel. I paid. Come on, say that once more, just once more. - You've really got a problem. - Yeah. That's right. Yes, you do. I've not time to waste with a little jerk. The contest means a lot to me. Really, your alexandrines... "Rodrigue, have you any courage?" You don't even know what an alexandrine is. Idiot! You're mad or what? In my face! Calm down. Stop your nonsense. "Rodrigue, have you any courage? "Any but my father Might test it at this moment." - What are you doing? - It's him. - Clément, what's up? - I said my text. OK, now. Listen to me, everybody. Let me say this again: contrarily to what you think, actors are far from a big family. We don't have to be pals with our partner. But you must practice together, act together. That's what it is to be professional. OK. Meanwhile, go and sit down, you two. - Sir. - Dieumerci, go and sit down. Audrey and Mélanie, on stage. Some Molière. Clément, go and see the secretary or I'll have to refuse you. "What lucky chance has brought you here? "In truth I was anxious for you, madam. "I've come to speak of something that I thought I ought to... "Dear! How glad I am to see you! "Their going away was certainly most timely. "- Shall we sit down? - It is not necessary. "Friendship ought most to show itself In things that are of most..." It's true, I saw my father yesterday and he'd forgotten to do the transfer. It's done. - Didn't you tell me that last month? - No. Clément, if this carries on, I'll have to inform the director. - Yeah. - I count on you. - Yeah... - Clément, I count on you. Ok, babe? Marc can pull some strings for you. - So? - 1,500 euros? What for? It's tough at the moment, I won't manage. Why's that? You're working for free? I had to take a room in a hotel. What? A hotel? What you doin' there? It's complicated. I can't stay at my mother's in the suburb. - I'm doing a training in Paris. - Of what? In drama. Trauma? Not trauma. Drama. You're kidding? It's serious. There's a contest and a job at the end. You'll be jobless, yes. J, o, b, l, e, s, s. I can't do like before. I must change things. Everyone wants to change lives. I'm not partying. You're right. But people who change lives, they give up finance to go make honey in Patagonia. But acting... Acting... I'll be just as lucky if I become a singer. You're scaring me, Dieumerci. You're scaring me. Daniel... 1,500 euros, for one month, at most. - If I win the contest, I... - And "if", and "if"... Come back to Earth. I don't know where you've gone. 50 000 euros debts, plus tax adjustments. You want me to go and say: "Your Honour, "my client can't pay up because he's taking drama classes." Go back to your mother, pay up your debts. - Understand? - Thanks. Dieumerci! What the hell... Dieumerci! You opened my letters! How come you stopped uni? I'm paying! Just because you're paying, that's it. What about your career? You did that to mum, too? You did that? You open everyone's letters? You serious? You're giving me lectures while you're cheating? Wretched man! Clément! I've got other clients. Stop it. It's hurting. I'm tired, understand? I'm not on leave. What's your problem? Go and see a shrink. - Wait on. Don't get upset. - What are you up to? My life's complicated... What about mine? We're done with practicing here. Listen to me, at least. No! I don't want to. Go back to your mum. I care a hang about your problem. Get out! I fell out with my father. He kicked me out. What's wrong? You the West Indian, stop illtreating him. He's groaning owing to your blows. - What? It's you who... - I work here. What's that? Look at he. With that sad face of his... And he understood I stopped going to uni. If I don't go back, he won't support me. - I sent him packing. - And your mother? She went to the States with my father's partner when I was 6. What do you want me to say? Huh? I don't know... Don't you have friends? No. I've got nobody. Nobody has nobody. - Dieumerci? - What? Have any deals to get a job? You can't give me all your problems. I'm not a social worker. I never searched for a job. Then get down to it. It's the moment. Go and learn. I dunno. Go to Mc Donald's. That's fine. And at least, you can eat. Without money, that's the end for me at Ventura. Then stop going to Ventura. That's all. End of story. I want to show them all I'm no sucker. Wait and see. How can I fend for myself, how I'll manage. First manage to shut your mouth, please. This kid's too much... What do you want? For the contest, it's the same for me. I have to work. Let me do and above all, don't talk. Promise. I promise I'll be quiet. I swear. If you tell me to talk, I'll talk, I'll follow you... - What did I just say? - Sorry. I won't say anything. Algerians are good crane drivers. Portuguese, that you know. And "blackies" are for hard work. Yeah. I've also got Romanians, right now. Well, that's Europe; Schengen, my boy. Romanians are quite good. They do... they do anything. OK. You can have them for 17,60 an hour, tax included. How many do you want? Think about it and get back to me. Dieumerci! I'm happy to see you again. You came with your body guard? Don't stand. Have a seat. This is Clément. Think you've got something for him? - Hello. - Hello. George Polito, at your service. Clément d'Ambreville. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Clément. Martin, tackle the dispatch instead of bumming around. And bring them 2 coffees asap. Yes, please. Thanks. - So? Adieu management? - I didn't really have a choice. - You owe lots? - Yes. What to do...? Good thing friends are there. Thanks, sir. The kawas... - Want sugar? - No. That's fine. 2, please. Can I have a glass of water? Sure, my boy. Plain or sparkling? Whatever you have. Saw that: fresh, handsome and young. - And digital. - Thank you. Martin, take them with you. They're brainy. Assign them to the wheelbarrows. To the what, sir? The wheelbarrows. Have anything else for him? More... Yes. At the bois de Boulogne. He'll need a van and... he'll also have to speak Brazilian. - You speak Brazilian, son? - No. That's the problem nowadays... languages. English as a second language is not enough. - Georges, listen, we... - What? What's wrong? I serve you my best. You don't need to work? You've not come just to make me waste my time? Sorry, sir. Actually, he couldn't know. I was wondering, since I studied law for 2 years, I was wondering... If I needed a lawyer. Well, listen. Er... - Clément. - Clément thing... You're sweet, you've got a nice face, but the people who pass this door are in the need. It's OK, George, he... I thought about it. I accept the wheelbarrow offer. I'll invest myself totally for your company. There. That's what I like to hear. Dieumerci, take him under your wing. You're on trial. Got your licence? - Yes. - A social security number? Yes. I've got my dad's. Hello. Clément. Nice to meet you. - Hello, Clément. - We're the new ones. Go over there. Nice to meet you. Clément. OK? Hello. Nice to meet you. Clément. - Hello, gentlemen. - Hi. OK? What's for today? Samir, take both of them. Go to the cinder blocks. The others shovel up. The new ones, come with me. You've got your licence? - Yeah. - Good. It's huge. I thought it was this. Manuel! All these Portuguese are deaf, huh. What about the Portuguese? - A problem? - No. Sorry, sir. - Yes. He said something. - Just shut up. Here are the 2 temps. Deal with them? - Tudo bem? - Tudo bem. OK. Vamos! - We're here to work. - He said something... I'll take that one. My piquel. There are 2 pedals. Accelerator and breaks. The gears are quite easy. First, second... which is my preferid. And the on-off button. And this lever is to empty the truck derr, to empty the earth derr. - Tudo bem? - Tudo bem. He's cool. - Tudo bem? - Yeah.Tudo bem. Go, I'll follow you. Dieumerci! I chtalled! Dieumerci! Super! Yeah. Watch out. Awesome! You know to drive that? - I'm taking my break. - OK. Go ahead. Thanks. No! Clément! It's like a console. Clément! No! Sir, don't let him... Clément! What the hell? What're you up to? - Get down! - No. Get down! It's OK. My grandfather's in farming. Clément, I'm telling you... Let me try and if I can't, I'll stop. OK, try it out. No need to be a graduate for that. There you are! So? Who's the best? Idiot... - Good, right? - Yes. Good. - Yes! - Yes. That's good. Dieumerci! Help! I can't stop it! Manuel! There's a "stop" button. - Which stop button? - Press on the big button. Dieumerci! You're a bloody idiot! Dammit it! I swear, I did all that he said. Shit! You're fired. Both of us? You know how much it'll cost us? You give a damn. He could've killed us both. You're alive. We're quits. It's totally illegal. We worked. Stop sticking to me, please. We're friends. A small note... ? It'll cost me an arm and a leg. Know how much a crapper costs? For friendship, we'll wait for the sales. The employer is answerable to the victims of the damages caused... The lawyer! Men are born free and equal until they temp here. Clément! Er, George... I need this money. - It's slavery. - Just shut up, will you! George, listen to me. Won't you understand? I just can't! - So bugger off! - You're talking to me? Dieumerci... What's it? You want to hit me? Go aheah, then. Hit me. Come on! Come on! So it's true, they're right. You never learn in prison. - It's OK. Come. Come. - Go on, bugger off. We're not done with you. You don't know who I am. - Let the dogs out, boss? - No. Why did he talk about prison? - You went to prison? - Forget about me. Leave me alone! They've no right! It's forbidden. You must sue those guys. - What? Am I not right? - Listen... You're right. Let's stop here. I can't take care of you. We're not a good match. Forget about the contest. Do what you want. I need to find a job. I need to find a job, too. I'm starving! Shit... Yes, mum? Yes... No... Mum... It's my life. It's none of Daniel's business. Dammit! Yes, I'm listening to you. Where? Now? What are you doing here? I'm playing golf. I'm praying for you. I'm attending the perpetual adoration. People pray nonstop here, since 1885. I spoke to Daniel. He told me about you. The school, the money... Why didn't you tell me? I don't have to. God sends us trials. You must be strong, son. But you've lost faith. You must believe in God, in the angels. - What's it got to do with God? - Quiet. I've not finished. If a mother can't help her child, she's not a mother. I'll manage. I'm a big boy. Pila! - Shall we, Marie-Thérèse? - Yes. I'm coming. - No! - There. It's nothing. - I don't want it. - It'll help you pull through. Mum, you've already done so much for me... I must go. But pray, huh? Now to Créteil, ladies. Mam... "My son, my earnest prayers are in your hands. "Whenever you doubt, do like me. "Go and burn a candle for 1 euro. "Pray and ask the Lord. "As I've already told you, "you've got an angel above. "Your mummy." "Ah, tell me. "Father to Chimene. "Ah, tell me. Father to Chimene." Dieumerci? We'll start anew. I really wanted to apologise. Yes... I bought you some food. I thought you might be hungry. You need to eat a little. It's chicken. Want some? A spoon, maybe. - "Rodrigue, have you any courage?" - What? Well, we need to practice. "Rodrigue, have you any courage? "Any but my father Might test it at this moment. "Righteous anger. "Noble pride to all my grief is sweet. "I recognise my blood in you complete. "My youth lives again in your fine ardour. "Come, son and blood "Restore my honour. "Come avenge me. "- For what? - For an affront so cruel... "It strikes our honour a blow that's fatal. "For an insult! The wretched soul should have died. "But my age robbed my noble pride. "And this blade my hand can scarcely bear, "I place it in yours to punish and repair. "Oppose the arrogant and prove your courage. "Only blood may redeem this outrage. "Kill... "or die." Stop! - I don't know the rest. - Never mind. It's super. I know what we'll do for the contest. It was so classy, the way Dieumerci acted. You've got something with oldies. - Depraved. - Rubbish! "How pretty you are, Camille, when your eyes sparkle." "He jests at scars that never felt a wound." Romeo and Juliet. You're kidding? Please trust me. But how could I act Romeo? That's just it. Super. Why do I play Juliet? That's not the point. I can't ask you to act the young maid, or you the lover boy. It's a contest. You must touch the jury, surprise them. That's theatre. Reveal what's most intimate, of yourself. You'll be the violin and the violoncellist. The instrument and the performer. Stick to each other. Live together, eat together, sleep together, do everything together. Don't waste time. Show them you're not a good-for-nothing. "But her eyes speak and I would like to respond. "But she is not addressing me." Marc will kill us. We're so late. - "Only your name is my enemy." - Stop it. "You'd still be yourself even if you stopped being a Montague." "The thing we call a rose would smell just as sweet..." Shit! Where do you think you are? You're taking the piss. "Aren't you Romeo? Aren't you a Montague?" Montague my foot! Tra la la la! Montague, fuck you! "See how she leans her hand on her cheek." Tra la la! They're a couple. Well... I love her. You think you love her? - Naturally. It's a bit... - A bit what? "The orchard walls are high and hard to climb. "With love's light wings." You're a hottie, eh? - It helps you by me being up here? - That's the balcony. "Where are you?" Get lost! "Who are you? "Why do you hide in the night "and listen to my private thoughts? No, really! What are you up to? Get down to work! Same for you. It's not the muppet show. Go and work. *Marriage for all. The end of the hostilities. It's a small gift for you. - A dancer? - Laxmi. The goddess of beauty. Hello, Brigitte. You've got the list of participants? I'm almost done with the file of Mr Saint-Michel. I'll bring it over. - Hello, sir. - Hello. Right. I'm in my office. Thank you. You shouldn't have. It's so pretty. I wanted to thank you for postponing the payments. It's normal for artists to help each other. Yes. Well. Thanks. Don't take too long to pay up. Alright. OK. Thanks, ma'am. Everyone calls me Brigitte. Thanks a lot. Carry on. OK. Start again from "She speaks". Alright? Start with "Alack"? "Alack... "She speaks! "O, speak again, "bright angel. "For thou art as glorious to this night being o'er my head "as is a winged messenger of heaven. To... this night. "For thou art as glorious to this night." "For thou art as glorious to this night being o'er my head "as is a winged messenger of heaven" "Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes of mortals "that fall back to gaze on him... "when he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds "and sails upon the bosom of the air." There you are. You're ready for the contest. Did you feel it or not? I did... Go back to your seats. Good. And perfect the staging now. - And, er... - It was good, Clément. Did you feel it or not? I warned you! I've not been paid yet. That's the thing with temping. The other day, your father was to do a transfer. Stop with your fibs. Go to Mr Ventura! Think I'm bumming around? I work. I don't spend my days behind a desk. Go and see Mr Ventura right now, or there's no point coming back. I didn't mean it. Go and see Mr Ventura right now and don't come back to me! "To dream an impossible dream..." The contest is called "New Talent", you agree with me? Absolutely. So, for you, this Dieumerci corresponds to the meaning of "New Talent"? Why not. After all, he's black... he's on the old side and just out of prison. I care a hang about all that. He's talented. The contest is open to everybody. I understand... But you know, even when one is gifted, you still need some luck, too, huh. So, as talented as he might be, I wouldn't want him to waste his time. That's all. Sadly, our vocation is not turned to rehabilitation. What we do need are youth with a future and potential. And I believe that, for the current contest, there are unfortunately no roles for ethnic actors. Am I wrong? No, Mr Ventura. Something else: young D'Ambreville, Marc, please, make an effort, but explain to him it's not a career for him. - He might have other talents. - He could always give drama classes. Like that, he could give a job to failed actors. By the way, I... What you did was really good, Dieumerci. We could do some Tennessee Williams, or a Lars Noren, together. - Sure. - You'd like to? - Whatever you want. - Cheers. - Fine. - Can I talk to you a moment outside? What were you up to? Where were you? Dieumerci! You were just awesome. It was great! - Really? - Yeah. It was super! I've organized something at home. Coming? I must see with my partner. I don't know. He's stressed out. But you were great, too... Just something small before the contest. It's OK by me. We must ask Juliet. C'mon, Juliet. What a loser! Forget about that chick. Hi, Clément! You're not funny, today. Come on, just kidding. Dieumerci! Come! You, too, come! Glad you're here. Plus, there are lots of stunning girls. Welcome! It's so cool! There, welcome. There are plenty of girls, plenty of boys... Clément, you know them. I'll get you some champagne? Clément? OK, you're far away. That's what she always does? The thing... - OK? - Yeah. I'll go and get some chips. OK, kiddos? Yo, man... There's Jaws. "Your pussy!" "Your pussy on a hot tin roof." T. Williams. - That's what we'll do. - OK. Super. It'll be super. It'll be great, wait and see. There's Jamel! Bloody awesome! Bloody... My Juliet's pouting... So, Doudou? You stopped partying? - Idiot. - Some rum? No, I'm fine. Honestly, I know what Mélanie's parties are like. Everyone's having fun. Except you. I've not partied like this since... - What? It's Audrey? - No. You're sad? Because she's not here? I saw you in the steps... It's OK, I said. I'm tired and I'm not thirsty. Make me happy. Can we toast to the contest? Please... There. To the contest and the new chapters. OK? There! OK, I'm going back. Go ahead. Juliet, any time, OK? Who authorised you to postpone payments to Saint-Michel Dieumerci? - I thought... - Who asked you to think? Next time, they'll be paying with meal vouchers? Brigitte, it's simple. Any student who's not up to date with payments, won't be listed for the auditions. That's the rule. Thank you, it's over. Please, go and do that in your office. Thanks. Yeah... Hello? Yes, it's me. What? What do you mean not up to date? But you told me... But I got instructions. Sorry, I don't want to lose my job. No... Shh! Calm down, Brigitte. Calm down. It's not your fault. I'll talk to the director. - No. - Why, "no"? - He's gone. - When will he be back? He didn't say, but he was terribly clear. You have a number where I could contact him? - No. - Come on! Dammit! You don't have a number? There's surely a way I could reach him. - Dieumerci? - What? I'm not going for the contest. I'm sorry. What? Where are you off to? This contest is all crap. We don't need this to succeed. I'm stopping. Clément, I swear that, if you stop... Go on, hit me... It won't change anything. - Even if we pay, it's the same. - What? It won't change a thing. There's no point yelling. I heard Ventura telling Marc that... he didn't want Blacks on the selection. And that I'm no good. That's it. - And you're telling me that now? - How could I have told you? You've got until tomorrow to find the money to enlist. - If you believe in it... - We'll do it. We didn't do all this for nothing. Move. I've got my savings account. What are you doing? He was there, selling his daughter's toys... His woman was in the street... - Hello. - Hello. So... - Jojo? - What? How much for this? - That's 600. - 600, for this? - 600. - You know how much it's worth? We do, but look here... Yes. So... It's the crisis. We've got plenty. - And this? - Dieumerci... - No! - There we are. That's gold. That's another story. There's a little angel, there. We can melt it. Something's engraved. "Dieumerci". It's catholic. - And Veronica. - And Davina. We'll take everything. Stop. We're not selling anything. Stop it! Shut your mouths up! Dieumerci, you can't do that. Go and wait for me at the hotel, and trust me. Trust. 850. Mister, I've got good news for you and for your fiancé. Come with me! Hello! Good news! The room is full. Cheaper for you. 10 euros. Happy? - You're happy? - You're kidding? No. It's just 2-3 days. When your mamma Senegal arrives, they go. Sir... - You'll be OK. - Yes, I did send the money. Mum... Tell small man I'm working. You'll be OK. As soon as I can, I'll come. You must tell him. OK? Hi, dad. Dad... I'm sorry. "Romeo..." Come on in. You know, son, I don't mind praying for you. But you must pray too. Mum, please... You know, there's a Chinese proverb that goes: "Even a dog has its star." Mum, I'm tired. OK. Good night, son. Good night, mum. Get me out of this, my angel. There. - For a good take off. - Good idea. - Brought from the Antilles? - Straight from the farmer. What you need, is... to show them you're willing. Sure. I can ask for a new instalment. Come and sit down, son. Come. It'll do you good. - Well, you'd have done your best. - Never venture, never win. Correct. Hello? What? Now? No, I can't. No, it's ridiculous. - So? - What's the matter? I don't know how he managed, but we're going for the contest. Jesus, Marie-José Pérec! It's wonderful. - You're not happy, son? - Daniel's right. It's too late. Listen to me, segulum. Don't let your second chance go by. So, I swear, you've got 10 minutes to get up, wash and go for that damn contest! But mum, can't you see there's no point. Dieumerci, in life, you must have no regrets. Go on! Mum, Daniel, hurry, I'm late! Daniel, hurry up, we'll miss my son. Come on, hurry. Dieumerci! Come, it's this way. I thought you'd never come. - I was so worried. - Where's Clément? Not too late? No, in the end, you'll be last. Dieumerci! I believe in you. - Go on, good luck! - Dieumerci... - I wanted to tell you... - Brigitte, leave him! - Good luck! - Dieumerci, it'll be your turn. - I've forgotten my text... - Perfect. You'll be OK. Good luck. How did you manage? - Well, I asked daddy. - No way... You're talking to a future lawyer. Listen... I've forgotten everything. The text and all... And honestly, Romeo and Juliet... - You wanted to be an actor. - Yes. To be an actor... It's always been my wish. But I don't know what happens in the suburbs... we bury our childhood dreams in wastelands. You know you've never told me... What? Well, why. Why you want to be an actor. You know, I was married, a long time ago. One evening, my wife came home, ran into my arms and said: "At last, it's worked, you're going to be a dad. "I'm pregnant." It was bliss. I was going to be a dad, I had my temping agency. - Godd...! That's stage fright? - Breathe in. You'll be OK. - I don't know if I'll make it. - You will. And then, 9 months later, little Julie was born. The little dolly. 2,7 kg. One 26th April. I still picture her nose, her mouth... her hair. She had jet black hair. But I can't remember her eyes. Because three months later, she was gone. While all was fine. "No luck", they said. That... That it happens, that we can have others. I don't know why she left. I guess I wasn't good enough a father. What do you do when you lose a child? For us... everything went haywire. I didn't understand why it happened to us. You know... why me? So, my wife and I... To forget, I started boozing, getting high... You can guess it was unbearable. So, we split. I locked myself in my place. So I got... seriously indebted. I couldn't pay anymore. I was like a tramp. I landed up in prison. That's when I realized I had nothing to lose. But it's stupid. You see, we... We wait to be in trouble to think... it's time to fulfil our dreams. You know what I did? I went to the wasteland and dug up that childhood dream. That's why I want to be an actor. And then you know the rest. Boys, your turn, now. Good luck! Good luck...! Clément D'Ambreville and Dieumerci Saint-Michel in Romeo and Juliet, act 2, scene 2, the scene at the window. Yeah. Why not, after all. At the time of Shakespeare, men acted as women. Shakespeare's long gone, now... - It's quite daring. - Good. My mother was right. Let's go, please. I've got an angel in heaven, now. It'll work. It'll work. - OK? - Yeah. "He jests at scars that never felt a wound. "What light through yonder window breaks? "- It is my lady, O, it is my love! - Alack. "She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel! "For thou art as glorious to this night, being o'er my head "As is a winged messenger of heaven "O Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? "'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, "though not a Montague. "Call me but love, "and I'll be new baptized; "Henceforth I never will be Romeo. "The orchard walls are high and hard to climb. "And the place death, "Considering who thou art. "With love's light wings did I ov'erperch these walls. "For stony limits cannot hold love out. "And what love can do, that dares love attempt. "- They will murder thee. - I am proof against... "I would not for the world they saw thee here. "I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes. "And but thou love me, let them find me here. "My life were better ended by their hate "Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. "Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow, That tips with silver "all these fruit-tree tops. - O, swear not by the moon, "Th' inconstant moon, that monthly changes in her circle orb, "Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. "Do not swear at all. "Send me word tomorrow. "So thrive my soul... "like softest music to attending ears. "At what o'clock tomorrow shall I send to thee? "At the hour of nine. "Parting "is such sweet sorrow that I shall say good night "till it be morrow." Dieumerci, you're the best! It's Dieumerci, my mate! Bravo! To my angel... Subtitles: ECLAIR - Hey, man, I swear... - Oh, no! - Seriously, I did drama. - Get lost! - OK, get lost! - I swear, at Etienne Dolet school. "Hey, you talking to me!" - "You talking to me!" - Yeah! You talking to me! I'm good, huh? Original version, now. - Bugger off. - See the face and all! - Even the beauty spot. - Shit.
