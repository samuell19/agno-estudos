Oh, thank you, Randall. Yes, ma'am. Now listen, you all order whatever you want because it's on Butch. No, Mama. What would Jesus do, Butch? I think we're all right. We can take care of our own. Oh, I'm not asking. Oh, well in that case, I think I'll have dessert too. Smart girl. Thank you, Mama. Chili dog. Wow. Thanks for saving me back there, babe. You're my knight in shining armor. Oh, I wasn't saving you, I was saving them from you. Oh, okay. I mean, how weird is that? Butch and... Mama. Hey, neighbor. Morning. Interest you in some coffee? I'm good, I appreciate it. I just saw your fire, wanted to let you know it gets real dry up here this time of year, so you be sure to douse those coals. Mm, will do. Oh, and by the way, the locals aren't real friendly to strangers, so you be sure to stick to the trails. Hm. Cranky locals. Got it. Oh my god, you smell that?

Oh, I could not be better, darling. Now listen, I am gonna have that apple crisp ready for that cakewalk next week, so don't you worry about a thing, okay? Okay, you know I never do, Mama.

Stella, you gotta come by the store, - your medicine is in. - Oh, thank heavens. - Well, the rain stopped. - Time to head back? Sure, I'm starving. Oh. Seriously? Gonna need a real meal after that. Oh, hon, you should redress that. That's your fault. I'll get the backpack. I miss you. Looks like they're trying to keep somebody out. Or something in. Wow. - Don't do that. - What are you doing?

Dillon. We need to get the hell outta here. All right. Let's try this again. Who sent you? Nobody. We're on vacation. In the middle of nowhere, vacationing? Of course you are. Well, lookie there. Hey, baby. Hey, you want some of this? Hey, don't worry, you're gonna get yours. Call me asshole now. Call me an asshole now. Butch. Come on out here and see what I found. Shut this bitch up. Leave her alone. Well, he ain't the feds, he's a cop. Atlanta homicide. Found his campsite about seven miles back. I guess I was wrong. Did you get rid of his stuff? Yeah. Took the jeep, dumped the gear. Not all of it. Hey. I need to apologize to you guys. I guess you really were telling me the truth. You know, I'm sorry. Sorry I was so mean, you know? I really am sorry. Throw 'em in the gully. - All right, you ready? - Yeah. One. Two. Three. You know what, she's kinda smooth, right? Are they really gonna fit your feet? They're nice boots. - Hey, hey, Captain Jack. - Hey, hey, Captain Jack. Meet me down by the railroad tracks.

We haven't got all day. You gonna quit, cupcake? You wanna be a Ranger, soldier? Rangers don't quit. Get up. Get up. Which way, left or right? Left. No, I will not be your accomplice. Come on, we need to leave. We're already trespassing. It's too damn early. I slept like shit last night. - Hey, morning, Butch. - Coffee. Hey, what the hell? Do you have to go pick the beans before you bring my freaking coffee? Did you put sugar in that? Yeah. I told you we should've kept that pretty camper. Might've been helpful around the kitchen. Since when do you start caring about cooking, boy? As long as she can cook in the bedroom, that's all we care about. Ain't that right, girl? Cleetus, you keep your hillbilly hands to yourself or I'll kick your ass. Hey, I didn't mean nothing by it, Butch. Just having fun. I didn't mean nothing by it, Butch. - Shut up. - You gonna get your ass kicked. - Mama. - Yes, boss? Butch. Y'all eat up now, you got business to do. Yes, Mama. You satisfied? Always. Mama don't mess around. You're not gonna check it? That's between you and Mama. I don't think you're gonna short her. Not her. Pack it up, boys. I thought you were dead. Thinking isn't your strong suit. Where are the rest of you? Dillon? We need to get the hell outta here. Who sent you? Transaction went good, Mama. That's good, baby, thank you. Woo hoo. Oo wee, how to speak French. Hey, let's get fancy there, college boy. Give it back, A-hole. Tell me, how do you say I'm a wussy in French? Le Butch? Ah, ah, ah. Y'all stop being ugly with one another now. Butch, give Lawrence back his book. Sorry, Mama. Come on, baby, sit down. How does it look? Eh, good enough. You fucking serious with that? I'ma go take a piss. Don't hurt yourself. Jesse, it's ready. Why don't you go get me another jug? If you cut me, you die, bitch. You killed my husband. You all die. You killed Earl. You're gonna take me to the rest of your clan. Kiss my freckled ass, I ain't telling you shit. I thought you might say something stupid like that. You whore. Clock's ticking. Go to hell. You're more afraid of Butch than me, huh? You know nothing. Butch is just an errand boy. Run, rabbit, run. Hey. Go see what those two idiots are up to. Yes, Mama. Hey. What the hell did you do? It wasn't me. It was that bitch, she's still alive. She killed Earl. Help me get this off. Get in the car. Get your ass in the car. Don't get blood all over my seats. What the? - What happened? - Bitch got me. Easy. You have one simple task and you couldn't handle it. You shot that jezebel and she's still alive. Better fix this. Yes, Mama. Patch him up. Go see what you can find out about this girl. Brenner Leigh Baker. NCAA national champion 100 meters. Runner-up pentathlon. Holy crap. Hey... First female Ranger. Hm. Isn't that special? Sheriff Hobbs to dispatch. Go ahead, Sheriff Hobbs. Send Briggs and Paul down to County Road 75 and Miller Road. I've got a body. Copy that. That's Earl Pitts. He's part of that clan up in the hills. Mama's clan. What? They all call her Mama. She owns all this land, 10,000 acres, and the Country Cafe on 56. They live by a different set of rules up there. Old Sheriff Sanders had us steer clear of her. Well, I ain't Sanders. Now, let's go see Mama. Let's go, boys. Mama. Earl is dead and Sheriff Hobbs is on his way out to see you. Get that bitch and make her pay. Can I help you, Sheriff Hobbs? Well, here to tell you one of your men was found dead. Yeah. Poor Earl. He'd been real depressed lately. I was afraid something like this might happen. What are you saying? He took his own life. You're saying he committed suicide, stabbed himself in the ribcage six times? It's real sad. Butch and Jesse saw the whole thing, didn't you, boys? Yeah, that's right. Jesse's still real tore up about it. I just wish we had been quicker. Fire broke out at our old fishing shack and we was tending to it. You mean still, right? No, sir. Just an old shack we kept our fishing gear at. Now, if that's all, sheriff, we got funeral arrangements to attend to. Well, I'll need a statement, but you can pick up the body from the coroner's office after the autopsy. I know. Bill's my cousin. He already called me. Okay. Briggs, Paul, let's go. I don't want that sheriff anywhere around here. You understand me? Tonight, we celebrate Earl. Tomorrow morning, I want you to bring me that bitch's head. Yes, Mama. Butch, you heard from Carl? Yeah, he's dropping off a shipment. He's on his way back. Good. And Cleetus, he hasn't checked in yet. - Check on him later. - Yeah. Okay. To Earl. He was a good boy. He was my boy. College boy, learn to be a man. You're gonna be a man. Fight me with a stick. Fight me with a stick for Earl. Come on. Butch, don't play like that. Pick it up and fight me with a stick right now. - Pick it up. - Come on. - Pick it up. - Pit it up and fight me with a stick right now. - Shut up. - Screw you guys. I'm going to bed. Go cry into Mama's lap. All right, sing along. ♪ Earl ♪ Earl, we love you, we love you, buddy. Earl, I can't play worth a shit. Earl. Fuck y'all, I'm going to bed. Please. Don't put me in there, please, don't. It's okay. Oh god no. I'm gonna get you out of here, okay? No, please, they'll hurt us. They'll hurt us, please, no. Not if we stay quiet, okay? Stay quiet. It's okay. Okay. Quick, come on. Follow me, okay? Watch out for him, okay? Come here. Quick, come on. She's taking us. Help. Go. Run, run, go. Shit. Go, go, go, go, go. Go. Head south. Cut 'em off at the river. Go, go, go. Butch is dead. What happened, boy? I don't know, but she's here. The Army girl. Over here. Keep moving. You say Carl's after her, right? Yeah. Carl will get her. Call Hank and get the dogs ready. Emily. It's okay. Get your ass over here, girl, now. No, they don't own you. I don't know who you think you are, but you ain't no different than the rest of these bitches. You're right. No better. No worse. Bitch. Shit. Go, go, go, go. Hey, Mama. Damn. That's hardcore. Hardcore, huh? If we keep heading west, we'll hit the highway. How do you know all of these things? You mean kill a man with my bare hands? I was in the military for some time. Like the Army? Not quite. Do you think maybe you could teach me some stuff? Sure. It might take some time. Listen, I'm gonna get you out of here and you'll get your life back, okay? I just need you to hang on a little while longer. I don't have a life. I'm pregnant. It's Butch's baby. Which means it's Mama's. They won't stop till they catch me. Emily, I'm so sorry. You're the first person to treat me decent in a long time. Listen to me, you girls don't deserve what happened to you. There's not a chance I'm leaving you. I'm not the first and I definitely won't be the last. What do you mean? Every few months, there's a shipment. They sell us in places with other girls. And sometimes there's upwards of 15, but they're quickly taken away. Connie is the only one that's been there a long time. I promise you, once I'm done with them, they will never hurt another girl. Okay? You hungry? Tastes better than it looks, I promise. Mail Man, we got one, bring her in. Hey. Hands in the air. In the air, now. We're on the same side. You, on the ground. Let's go. No, wait. Stop. You're gonna be okay. Yeah. Who are you? Don't worry about it. Take a deep breath. Ready? Put pressure on it, all right? Let's go. Wait, we can't leave him. They'll kill him. Not our problem. Neither was I. Come on. We have to hurry. Glen, we're on 'em. Get the dogs. Come on. No. I can't make it. - Let's keep going. - No, stop. No, no. Okay, back here. Back here. Go through here. Come on. Follow me. Be careful. Over here. Get in there. Stay here and we'll divert them. What the hell is going on? Just know I'm one of the good guys. Wait for them to pass and then get out of here or they will kill you. - Do you understand? - Yeah. Good luck. Okay. Okay. It's okay. Come on. They're heading to the river. Okay, let's cross the river. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hup, hup. Out of the car. Hands up, now. Whoa. Oh, thank God. Emily, in the car. Back in the car. Let's go. Oh my god, what the hell happened to y'all? No time to explain, just get us into town. We're about two hours out. No, wait, the sheriff. We left him upriver and he's really badly injured. You have to send help now. It's okay. I'll send somebody for him. Get away from her. Enough. Oh, now you want to be the hero, asshole? Enough? I say when it's enough. Sorry, Mama, I just figured you wanted her alive. You figured right, but you don't talk to my boys like that. I gotta go. Smartest thing you've said. Bring 'em up to the house. - No, Bren, Bren. - It's okay, it's okay. All right, all right, all right. Settle down. Hey. All right. Just get her up. Emily. I took you in off the streets. I fed you, I clothed you. I treated you just like one of my own. And this is how you repay me? I sentence you to death. What? No, no, Mama, please, don't. It was me. I took her. Thought I could use her against you. Excuse me? Use her to get me out of here. So you're telling me that she didn't wanna leave? That you forced her? I told her if she got me out of this hellhole, she could start a new life for her and her baby. She wanted to stay, I didn't give her a choice. She's with child? Yes, Mama. It's Butch's. Put her back in rotation. Now, for you. You trespass on my land, you kill my boys, you mess up my operation, and you cost me money. As Jesus died for our sins, so shall you die for yours. Such a poetic judgment. Oh, no, I will not be judging you. That's a job for my lord and savior. And I shall be judged too when I come to the pearly gates, but today's not my judgment day. Today's your sentencing day. The last thing you're ever gonna see is my bullet in between your eyes. Oh, darling. You are so sweet. Lock her up. Nice watch. Thank you. It was a gift from Jesse. You remember Jesse, don't you? Not really. All you mouth-breathers look the same. Baby, that's perfect. Grab her arms. You always take me to the nicest places. Oh, she's bad, no, she's bad. Boy, I sure would like to take a run at that skank. You better keep your hands to yourself, boy. Mama will skin you alive. Mama don't care. I tell you, I'm gonna have me some fun tonight. That girl will eat you up and shit you out. She's hogtied and hanging like a skinned deer. I think I could handle her. I bet Butch thought so too. Vince, your turn to babysit. What's Mama keeping her around for anyhow? Gonna break her, put her in rotation. You ain't breaking that filly. Mama better put her down and I mean quick. Hank says Mom can break anybody. Vince, get your ass inside. Glen, go and feed the dogs. I just sat down. I don't care. Go feed the dogs. This right here, man, to Mail Man, I'm clean. Cheers. How he gonna break her? How long have you known? I wasn't sure until last week. If you think I believe that bullshit story that she told, then you're even dumber than I thought. And I don't think it's possible. Mama... Shut that whore mouth of yours. Only kept you around here because of Butch. When that baby's done, you're done. Now, you feed my boys. Baker, Brenner. 75th Ranger Division. Zero, zero, three, eight, four, seven, five, six, three. Baker, Brenner. 75th Ranger Division. Zero, zero, three, eight, four, seven, five, six, three. Drink. Drink. Sorry. It's okay. Thanks. What the hell are you doing, boy? I'm sorry, Vince. Hey. Pick this crap up. I better not catch you back in here. You're real tough, aren't you? Shut up, skank. Oh, and articulate. Oh. Is she okay? Yeah, she's fine. Oh. You're all like cockroaches. I kill one of you, two more show up. What are you, like, cockroach number nine? I don't give a shit about you or your dead husband. If I had been there, you'd be dead too. Why don't you come here and put your money where your mouth is? Girl, you're making me hard. Vince. Your breakfast is ready. Don't you see I'm having a moment? Sorry. You don't want it to get cold. You'll do. Stop struggling, you know you want it. - Vince, stop. - Hey, shit-stain. Why don't you stop messing with girls and see what a real woman feels like? Oh, you want some, bitch? Well, you're gonna get it. Oo. This is gonna be good. Emily, listen to me. Emily. Emily. It's okay. You're okay. Get the knife and cut me down, all right? Get the first aid kit. Give me the knife. Okay, go hide under the bed. Wait. Where are you going? To clean house. Me some of that pie, man. I'll give you this, you are resilient. Not resilient enough. I'll make this quick and clean. A soldier's death. You get one chance. - Okay, all right. - Do you understand? I never want to see your face again. Well, I must say, you are very, very... Resilient? Yeah, I've heard that. And a smartass too. Just stop. You have no one left. Just let her go and we'll leave. I knew you tainted her, brainwashed her. But you're wrong about me not having anybody left. No. You didn't deserve this. I'm so sorry. Here's the last box of evidence, boss. I ordered you a sandwich from the deli. It should be here in 20 minutes. Now, Suzy from the deli is also delivering to Joe from the auto body shop, and when I say delivering, I mean delivering. Thank you, Bethany. That'll be all. I'm just saying. Sheriff Hobbs. Be ready, I may need you from time to time. Subtitles by explosiveskull
