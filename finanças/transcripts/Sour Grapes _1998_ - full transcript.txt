HE WAS FINISHED PLAYING. HE PUT A QUARTER IN, SAID TO ME, "YOU GOT 2 QUARTERS?" I GAVE HIM MY LAST 2 QUARTERS. SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? LOOK, THEY WERE MY LAST 2 QUARTERS. I COULD HAVE PUT THEM IN MY MACHINE AND WON. NOT ONLY THAT, YOU CAN'T HIT A JACKPOT WITH ONE QUARTER. I'M THE ONE WHO TOLD HIM TO USE 3. YOU THINK HE SHOULD GIVE YOU MONEY? OF COURSE HE SHOULD GIVE ME MONEY. HE SHOULD GIVE ME HALF THE MONEY. AND, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE TECHNICAL, HE SHOULD GIVE ME TWO THIRDS. WELL, HE'S NOT ACTING LIKE A GUY WHO'S READY TO GIVE AWAY HALF HIS MONEY. YOU SHOULD JUST TALK TO HIM. NOW? WHY NOT NOW? IN THE MORNING HE WON'T EVEN REMEMBER I GAVE HIM ONE QUARTER. DOCTOR!

IF THE SITUATION WERE REVERSED, DO YOU THINK I WOULD DO THAT? AND I GAVE HIM A FREE PHYSICAL THE OTHER DAY. CAN WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE, PLEASE?

HE WANTS HALF? WHY SHOULD YOU GIVE HIM HALF? BECAUSE WHEN I WAS PLAYING THE MACHINE, I PUT IN A QUARTER, I HAD NONE LEFT, AND SO I ASKED HIM FOR 2 QUARTERS. SO HOW DOES THAT ENTITLE HIM TO HALF? THANK YOU. I AM TELLING YOU, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ONE MORE WORD ABOUT THIS, OR I AM GOING. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? WHERE'S SCOTTY? [WOOF] SCOTTY? WHAT DO YOU THINK, ROBERTA? YOU AGREE WITH RICHIE? NO, I DON'T. IT'S WRONG. I'VE HAD IT WITH THIS. AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE! YOU'LL HAVE TO KILL ME BEFORE I GIVE HIM A PENNY! YOU HEAR ME?! KILL ME! HE GETS NOTHING! NOTHING! NOTHING! DID YOU EAT? UNBELIEVABLE. I KNOW. IMAGINE THAT. I CAN'T. WE SHOULD SUE HIM. REALLY? IF I COULD GET THIS THING IN FRONT OF A JURY, THEY WOULD HAVE TOTAL SYMPATHY FOR YOU. DANNY PEPPER'S HERE AGAIN. UH, I KNOW. IT'S FINE. SHE DOESN'T KNOCK? I'M SITTIN' HERE IN MY UNDERWEAR. IT'S OK. SHE'S LIKE A NURSE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "LIKE A NURSE"? SHE'S A RECEPTIONIST. SAME THING.

Evan: OK, WELL, HERE'S YOUR PROBLEM, DANNY. THE NERVE TO THIS TESTICLE IS DAMAGED, AND THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT FUNCTIONING. BUT THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS THAT YOU COULD BE COMPROMISING YOUR ONE GOOD TESTICLE. SO, WHAT HAS TO BE DONE? WELL, YOU'VE GOT TO LOSE THAT TESTICLE AND, WITH IT, ALL OF THE INFLAMMATORY TISSUE THAT'S IN THE WAY. AND WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE IT DONE? WELL, IT COULD LEAD TO AN ABSCESS. ALSO, YOUR SPERM COUNT WILL CONTINUE TO DROP, AND YOU WOULD BECOME STERILE. NO MORE PEPPERS? NO MORE PEPPERS. THAT WOULD BE SAD. AHEM. IS IT... COMPLICATED? AH, THERE'S NOT MUCH TO IT. IT'S JUST AN OVERNIGHT STAY IN THE HOSPITAL, AND YOU CAN BE BACK AT WORK IN A FEW DAYS. WELL... LET'S DO IT! OF COURSE YOU'LL WANT TO GET YOURSELF ANOTHER DOCTOR. WHY? I DON'T REALLY DO GENERAL SURGERY ANYMORE. BUT YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE. YEAH, BUT, UH... WELL, I HEAR YOU'RE THE BEST, AND, REALLY, DO I DESERVE ANYTHING LESS?

HE'S GOT SOME NERVE. WHAT COMMENTS? HE MADE SOME EXTREMELY NEGATIVE STATEMENTS ABOUT MY NEW SOLE DESIGN. THE CIRCLES? THAT'S RIGHT, THE CIRCLES. I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM DESIGN SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THE CIRCLES? THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE. THEY HAPPEN TO BE VERY COMFORTABLE. NOBODY DESIGNS SOLES LIKE HIM. NOBODY.

DON'T YOU THINK THAT YOU SHOULD TRY AND WORK SOMETHING OUT? FRANKLY, I DON'T SEE WHAT THERE IS TO WORK OUT. IT WAS MY MACHINE. WHY SHOULD I GIVE HIM MONEY FROM MY MACHINE? GIVE HIM A FOURTH. COMPROMISE. I AM SURE THAT IF YOU GAVE HIM A FOURTH, HE WOULD GLADLY TAKE IT. IT'S THE GESTURE THAT HE WANTS. THAT'S ALL HE'S WANTED FROM THE BEGINNING. NOPE! HE GETS NOTHING! NOTHING! MY BOSS WANTS ME TO GO TO CHICAGO WITH HER TOMORROW. I'LL BE BACK IN A FEW DAYS. DON'T YOU GIVE HIM A PENNY, YOU HEAR ME? SO YOU'LL CALL RICHIE TOMORROW? YES, YES. DEFINITELY.
