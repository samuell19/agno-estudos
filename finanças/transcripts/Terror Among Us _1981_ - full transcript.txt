Hey, man. Let me out of here. Let me out for a cigarette. Good luck, you guys. I hope you don't come back. Four fish for the line-up room. Four out. Move across all the way to your left, gentlemen. Come on. All the way across. All right, now face the front. Stand direct. Chin up. Okay, now there's no need to worry. They can't see you so look at each one of them. Then take your time and if you recognize any of them you just say so, okay? That's the one. Third from the left. Yes. The third one. You both are certain? -I'm sure that's him. -There's no doubt. All right, gentlemen, turn to your right. Your other right. Move out. You heard the man, move out. Let's go. Move! Those eyes. Did we choose the right one? The man you picked was Detective Rawlins from my narcotics squad. The man who was watching us was he there? Yes ma'am, he was. This better be good, Delbert. I lost some money, Mrs. Paxton. I had it folded in my pocket. I was there earlier on at delivery. It's part of my route, so I came back to look for the money. I swear, that's the truth. Oh, Delbert. Even I could think up something better than that. I didn't just think it up. Look. You told me to always tell the truth, right? Well, I did, and here I am. Look at me. You think I have to go around peeping at old women? I got a girlfriend at home. Mrs. Paxton, I can't afford to lose my money. I wasn't at their window. I swear it, Mrs. Paxton. -Well? -Well, he admits to being there but not to prowling. He says he was looking for some money he lost. Where'd he say he lost it, in their bathtub? Is that what your witnesses said? -That he was looking into their bathroom? -That's right. They couldn't pick him out of the line-up. They liked some skinny kid from narcotics better. -Coffee? -Yeah, please. Black. So, sergeant, what's gonna happen to Ramsey? The two women can't identify him but he admits to being there. You're his parole officer, violate him for prowling. That'll keep him in jail. They'll send him back to the joint at a parole hearing. He admits to being there but not to looking in their window. Your witness couldn't even identify him. They're older women. They're nervous. They're frightened. It's to be expected they wouldn't be a good witness. But it's him. You can bet on that. We're not talking about picking up the all-American boy on his way home from a scout meeting. We're talking about a convicted rapist with a rap sheet as big as the yellow pages. You haven't got a case, sergeant. I mean, I can't create one for you. If he weren't labeled on parole, would you be so concerned? No. No, I wouldn't. But he is on parole, for rape and it's the same MO he used before. Watching, prowling, raping. People can change, sergeant. Most of his offenses were as a teenager. A product of a broken home, too many foster homes. But he's got a job now. He's got a girlfriend. For the last ten months he has shown evidence that he really wants to straighten out. And what if he's not? You know, you may not believe this, sergeant but we have had tremendous success with cases like Ramsey when they've had our help. And what about Ramsey's next victim? Who's gonna help her? That's a loaded question, sergeant. And this is a judgment matter. One to be decided by his parole officer. Me! Now, in my opinion, there's doubt. And Ramsey should get the benefit of that doubt and our help. The system may not be perfect, but without it, we just have nothing. We're not prepared to go with the "lock him up and throw away the key" philosophy. Fine, fine. It's my job to protect the innocents from the aberrations that are free to attack them. You got a match? You know, sergeant it is men like you who never believe in justice till you need it for yourself. No, I don't have a match. Does anyone know how to spell pomegranate? I do. A-P-P-L-E. No, wait a minute. Isn't Pomegranate an Italian sports car? You're both very funny. Why don't you use apple? It was the forbidden fruit. Yeah, but pomegranate sounds more exotic in a bestseller. "The blonde, although attractive, was not terribly bright "having recently tripped over a 747." Clear air turbulence. Pomegranate. P-O-M-E-G-R-A-N-A-T-E. -Thank you. -Any time. Wait till the airline finds out they're in it. You're going to be working a bus coast to coast. Yeah, but don't you think a... Novel titled Skirts in the Sky is a little too much? Skirts in the Sky ? -Right. -Come on, no... Don't listen to them. My novel is not going to be a sex expose hot off of Stu's griddle. Do you really have a newlywed Stu in it? Vickie, how long has it been now? Nine hours, four days one week and two months of marital bliss. With a flight engineer? Do you miss working? No way. Now I only feed one man, not the whole plane. Well, Bud and I are getting close to making it legal, but he's got one stipulation too many. He makes the living at 33,000 feet and I'm grounded doing the housekeeping. What was that old saying about "Old Stus never die, they just fly away?" Oh, Vickie. See, if you guys are lucky, maybe later, I'll clean your toes. -Oh, right, Vickie. -Tempting, Vickie. Okay, how much do we have... I don't trust her. Anybody home? This is ridiculous. I can't sit out here with this silly thing on. You raisins wrinkle up all you want to. I'm gonna go wash my hair. How does a one-armed stewardess manage that? Very carefully. I was just gonna put these in the bedroom. I didn't mean any harm. The door was open. Please, please, I was just trying to help out. I thought you might need these. I'll just put these right here. I'm sorry. You bring my cigarettes? Sorry, I forgot them. Forgot? Forgot? All you gotta do all day is push around that rag-wagon and you forgot? I said I'm sorry. Well, I am not gonna stand in that kitchen over a hot stove and fix you dinner when you can't even remember to bring me a pack of cigarettes. I can go without your cooking. What? I said I'll get them as soon as I wash up. Wash up? What'd you do to get your hands dirty? You fall down? You know what Bud doesn't realize? He has to get me a 747 kitchen otherwise he's going to have cold-cuts and take-out pizza. Next! I have a date! No, no, no! Okay, which one of you flying tigers took my bra? I've got a date with an airplane. Personally, I don't use one. Don't plan on spending an hour in there. Flight 403 to Sacramento and San Francisco now boarding. Please report to the lost and found baggage counter... Hi, Marge. Hi, Jen! Come in. You never sent in that application I mailed you. Did you change your mind since our last talk? I think the stewardess school can survive without me. I guess so. But we could use your experience and your expertise. They are hiring a bunch of charm-school graduates. The kind who think the Wright brothers were just a couple of guys who didn't make mistakes. They worry more about how to smile than about how to ditch. We can use you, Jen. An old veteran, huh? There's value to experience. Anyway, you're the one who said it may be time to give up the grind and try something different like being an instructor. And stand around and listen to my arteries harden? I wouldn't put it that way. But the emphasis is on youth, Jen. We're not getting any younger. Of course you could always get married and raise a flock of kids. Come on, Marge. Don't knock it till you've tried it. What, getting old or married? Seriously. How much longer do you want to fly? You tell me. You're a valued employee. There's a hundred jobs you could fill. Perhaps one like mine. An office? A desk? I don't think so, Marge. You can't live in this girl-scout camp forever. Thanks, Marge. I'll think it over. And I'll be here. Thank you. Thank you. Hi, welcome aboard. Where've you been? Checking the calendar. Why? You got a birthday coming up? I thought you were gonna fix something. What about dinner? I got a headache. I don't feel like cooking. You knew that before I went out, didn't you? Don't start with me, Delbert. I'm not in the mood. You could have told me. Told you? Told you? You know I'm under a doctor's care. I'm sick and all you can think about is your stupid stomach. You lazy, good for nothing... Don't call me names, Sara. Don't call me names. What are you gonna do? Hit me? You so much as raise a hand to me and I'll be on the phone to that parole officer you got the hots for. You aren't man enough to hit me you spineless... That's right, Delbert. Run. Say, Beth. May I borrow these? I don't mind at all. Those are Barb's. I know. I just wanted a second opinion. So, who's your date with? Jeff Canfield. He's a pilot over at Sun West. Oh, Cathy. He is a terrific pilot. You know, Cathy, I'm really determined to get my pilot's license. -You're really serious about all this. -I sure am. Who's your date with tonight? A guy. Well, I'm glad to hear that. What's his name? Smith. John Smith. You know, Cathy, there's a rule. We're not supposed to go out with johns. So when the president of the company called and said "We're gonna need your advice in this matter" I reminded him that I had called him two days earlier. -And did he remember? -Oh, yes. He had to because after I called him, I sent him a memo. Very clever. Well I knew the moment would come. I've waited long enough for it. Now I know my promotion cannot be far behind. Well, I think that he's very lucky to have you. Thank you. Cathy remember last week in flight before you had your accident, we talked? Yes. I told you I was divorced. I remember. Well, I lied. I'm not divorced. This is the first time that I've ever gone out on Sharon and I... I'm not looking for an affair, Cathy. My wife was injured in an automobile accident two years ago. She's never been the same since. I simply miss going out. I was attracted to you. I'm sorry I misled you. I hope you can forgive me. -I'm afraid that I've been... -No, no. It's okay. I'm glad you told me. At least it's honest. It's just that I care about you more than I realized. Get up, you lazy bum. I've been working all night, washing out bedpans. And you lay here on your fat backside, late for work. Come on. Come on! Get outta here! I wanna get in that bed. Not with you. On behalf of Captain Hollister and the crew we would like to welcome you to Los Angeles. The local time is 8:55. Please remain seated until we've reached the gate and the captain has turned off the seatbelt sign. Thank you. Hey, Barb, why don't you come along? This guy's boat is really something. Come on, Pam. I'm an almost married woman. And besides, Jen and I have something planned for this evening. Oh, come on. You're not gonna spend all your time with Amelia Earhart's stepsister. What are you gonna do? Sit around and listen to her collection of Pat Boone records? Didn't your mother ever teach you to respect your elders? I'm sorry, Jen. What are you sorry for? It's not your fault. You know maybe she was right. I think I do have some Pat Boone records. Oh, gosh. So, Jen, what should I do? I can't answer that for you, Barbara. It's a decision you have to make, whether or not you want to quit. Yeah, but I don't want to be just a housewife and Bud won't change his mind. He does the flying. Period. Well, maybe you can talk him into letting you continue to fly while you're both getting used to being married but it's a decision that's not gonna go away. If he wants you to stop flying will he still be the man you want to spend your life with? Hey. Just don't lose him. -Hi, gang. -Hi, Cathy. -Hi. How was Chicago? Hey, did you hear? Jenny's bra came home. -It what? -It's a homing bra. -Uh-huh. -Where'd you find it? -Hanging outside on the doorknob. Is that really where you found it? Dial-a-date. May I tell her who's calling? He says he's a friend. -Hello? -Hello, Cathy. It's Rob. Oh, hi. I'm glad you called. Listen. Much to my good fortune I have to spend another night. Now, I've got a brief meeting in the morning and then I'm free for the day. I'd like very much to see you. Well, I'd like that too. And since the airline has me grounded until my arm gets better I am certainly gonna be here. I'll call you then. Perhaps we can take a drive up the coast. Oh, that sounds great. I'll see you tomorrow. I'm sorry. My truck wouldn't start. I went and got a push. You got a telephone, don't you? Or wouldn't it start either? That's twice, Delbert. Third time's the charm. Once more and I hire another driver. Now get the van loaded. You got a heavy day. Jennifer! Someone's at the door! Jen! The door! Okay, okay. I got it. -Oh, hi! -Hi. -Got any cleaning this morning? -Sure have. Just a sec. Guys, the cleaning man's here. Anybody got anything? Oh, yeah! My uniform. It's in the bottom of the closet. -Okay. -Oh, and my blue pants, too. -Got it. And my stuff's on the stool in the living room! That's it. Thanks a bunch. Thank you. Oh, hi. I was just going out back. -Would you hang those on the doorknob please? -Yeah. What the hell are you doing there? I said, what the hell are you doing there? Oh, my God! -What happened? -Call the police. Now the only crime we can book Ramsey for is trespassing, a misdemeanor. Listen, sergeant. This guy is some kind of a nut. He should be locked up. What do you think would have happened to Vickie if I hadn't of been home? Well, he's on parole. If we can convict him of trespassing I can get him violated and sent back to prison. What's he on parole for? Rape. Well, well, Delbert. Just like old times. Second time we've seen each other in 48 hours. Hey, sergeant. -I didn't do anything. -You know anything that you say... Yeah, I know my rights! I didn't do anything! That woman was coming on to me when her husband comes in and busts me! You're headed down the same path and you're disgusting. Nothing's changed but the calendar. You're three years older and not one day smarter. You've conned your parole board and your parole officer. They think you've changed. You're using those people. But I'm not buying it because I know what you are and I know what you're doing. I got you this time, Delbert. I'm gonna send you back to prison. There are a lot of nice decent people in this world and I don't want you to hurt any of them. You know, in a way I'm doing you a favor by locking you up. You'll be getting help, Delbert. And you need it. Now, come on, Rich. We got him off the street. Couldn't you talk to the judge and get a court-ordered evaluation? I know he'll come up dirty. Come on, Tom, all you've got is a simple trespass and a shaky one at that. He was at the apartment delivering dry-cleaning. He didn't take anything. Besides, he's been there before on deliveries. The judge would laugh at the request. Why is this guy so special? Because 48 hours ago, I had him for prowling. Now I've got him for trespassing and he's on parole for rape. Do I have to tell you what's next, Rich? No, you don't have to tell me. But you know the system, Tom. Innocent until proven guilty. -Have you talked to his parole officer? -Yeah, she's a young psychology major from USC who was a counselor for youth authority. She's now a parole officer with 18 months experience and a belief that truth and justice will triumph. So do I, Tom, but you're not talking about truth and justice. -You're talking about the system. -Mmm, the system. Man, I have had it up to here with the system. There are too many of you protectors who are overly concerned with his rights. Rich, I'm just trying to do my job. Help me to protect the rights of innocent people from the Ramseys of the world. Come on, Stockwell, you're being inflexible. The law has to protect every individual's rights down to the last syllable. That's the only way it all works. Is it fair that Ramsey is being treated as a trespasser when he's a rapist? Rich, you see this lady? She's not blindfolded to remain unbiased. She's blindfolded because she's embarrassed. Can I bum a smoke? Yeah, thanks. Come on, answer the phone. Come on, man. If you don't get an answer, try again later. I ain't got time for this. Hello? Sara? Who is this? It's me, Delbert. Listen, Sara I need some help. Where are you? I'm at the courthouse. I need some money. Money? -What for? -I just need it, Sara. What's all that noise? You in jail? Sara, please, just -listen to me. -No, you listen. Rot in jail. I warned you. Come on, man. If you're done, get away from the phone. Are we ready on the Ramsey matter, gentlemen? There will be a people's motion for a continuance, your honor. Our principal witness, a flight engineer has been detained in Chicago due to inclement weather. Mr. Shields? The defense is ready to proceed, your honor, and will not waive time. Mr. Shields I'm sure that you know, the people by statute have a right to a continuance for good cause. Yes, your honor, but my client has been in custody for nine days for this minor offense. Reasonable bail has been set. Reasonable, your honor, depends upon your point of view. I'm quick to point out that $500 is a reasonable amount if you have it. My client is a man of very limited means. Prior to his arrest, he was employed. His employer cannot hold the position open indefinitely. If your honor would consider an OR release... You honor, I must point out that the offense here is trespass. Trespass by a paroled rapist in a young woman's apartment. -Mr. Shields... -Are we going to argue facts not in evidence? If so, let's question the possibility that my client was enticed into this woman's apartment. Your honor, I demand that Council apologize! Now, I will have order in my courtroom and I caution both of you against further outbursts. A simple matter on a heavy court schedule has taken enough of the court's time. Now, I have two requests before the bench. Mr. Clayburn your request for a continuance is granted. This case will be continued for ten days. All witnesses are ordered to return to this courtroom without further order or subpoena on that day. Thank you, your honor. Respect to your request, Mr. Shields I see from the file that your client is on parole. However he does have a favorable report from his parole officer. Therefore, considering the minor offense and the time the defendant has spent in custody the request for release on his own recognizance is granted. He is ordered released forthwith. Court is in recess for ten minutes. Ms. Stevens. I'm sorry. Yeah. Me, too. Somehow, I thought we were the good guys. I came down here to be insulted in front of a packed courtroom? To watch that... That man walk out free? What happened to justice? Where is it? What about my rights? Yeah, I'm sorry, too, sergeant. Sorry I ever agreed to do this. I'd like to thank you for your favorable parole report, Mrs. Paxton. Don't confuse favorable with objective, sergeant. I'm sure Vickie Stevens will be delighted to hear that. That'll be a comforting thought for her. What is it, sergeant? Do you really think I'd be fighting to keep Ramsey off the street if I didn't think we were helping to rehabilitate him? Not important what I think. The fact that Ramsey walked out of that courtroom a free man that's very important. I don't make the rules, sergeant. I don't like a lot of the system any more than you do but it is the only one we have. And I'm gonna do my best to make it work because that's my responsibility. Now, if you want to blame me for that, that is your privilege but when I go to sleep tonight, I'll know I did my best with or without your approval. That'll be three dollars, Mrs. Hanes. Thanks. You have a nice day now, huh? Delbert. What can I say? Nine days. I had to hire another driver. Yeah, well I got some money coming. You got arrested. Nobody called me. The truck got towed in, impounded. It cost me $72. You owe me six dollars. No, you owe me! I want the money. I earned it. I told you it's gone. Now it's your fault the truck got towed in, not mine. Now get out of my shop. Delbert, you don't need any more trouble. Just go. You'll be sorry. How'd you get out of jail? Maybe I'm out 'cause I didn't do anything. Yeah, and I'm the tooth fairy. I want you packed and out of here today. I'm not living with some pervert. -I pay my share. I got a right. -Oh, you got nothing. I want you out. And I want you out today! You go leech off somebody else if you can find anybody who'll put up with you! There isn't any woman who'll love you! You're worthless! Worthless. I know one that does. I know one. Sure you won't come along? Oh, no thanks. Bud's flying in at nine. And besides, I'm boning up on wallpaper, drapes, carpets. You remember those things, don't you? Civilians use them. Oh, yeah. Isn't love grand? Are you getting nervous? Just a little. Jennifer. I'm gonna be Mrs. Bud Chapman, ex-stewardess. In 36 more days, I'm gonna be Mrs. Bud Chapman. That's so great. But, you know, between you and Vickie, this is getting contagious and dangerous. -Oh, be sure you tell your sister hi, will you? -Okay, bye bye. Give it! Give it! Hey! Kids! Kids! Kids, I told you not to run in the house. Mom used to say that to us, too. -It didn't work then, either. -No. Tell Bill I said goodnight. He was up early this morning. Little Billy had a game in Oxnard. Thank you. Hey, Jen. Whatever happened to that pilot you introduced me to? -Scott... -Markham. -Yeah. -Scott Markham. Oh. He flew off into the sunset with some bubble gummer. Well, you could have prevented that. He would've married you. I could see it. I could see it, too. I could see he wanted five rooms and a pool a girl at the gate and a comforting shoulder. I'm none of those. But you could be. You're not getting any younger, I mean... How many more Scott Markhams can there be for you? Well. This life if for you, Kimmy. I'm glad you're happy. I don't think it's for me. How much longer are they gonna let you fly? I don't know. I could be the first stewardess flying on social security. Good night, hon. Thank you. Come on, Delbert, get out of there. Come on! Oh, no, no, no. You don't bring any money into this house. Don't expect to sit around and suck up mine. I told you I wanted you out of here. Today! No. You lay around, sitting in the bathroom. What were you doing in there? What? You're a good-for-nothing, lazy bum who does nothing but lay around the house all day... How was Seattle? Beats Bakersfield. Sherry from the Atlanta flight called. She wanted to know if she could have Barb's room. Why don't you ask Barb? We don't count you anymore. Since I'm the one that has to share the room, I should choose the replacement. Ooh, maybe it's somebody interesting. I just need a couple more chapters. -I could wrap up my book. -You mercenary! Maybe we should get somebody who doesn't fly. God, she's be in shock within a week. Hey, you guys. You're making me cry. Barb. You know we're gonna miss you, don't you? Yeah. I'm gonna miss you guys, too. Uh-oh. Just a minute. Come on. Let's not rush this. The moment's gonna be here soon enough. Come on. Besides, you start now, your eyes are going to get puffy and they're gonna stay that way all day long. -I'll get it. -I'll get it. It's probably for me. Hi. Who is it this time? She's not saying much about this one. It might be the real thing. No, no, no. The last one was the real thing. Or wasn't the one before that. Barbara. Ladies, I need the bath. I'm going to go out. I just hope he's a nice guy for a change. She really deserves it. Well, our beautiful, zany, crazy Cathy has a problem. She doesn't seem to know the difference. Call the next case. People vs. Delbert L. Ramsey. Number A02267. Is Delbert Ramsey in the courtroom? Ramsey? Delbert Ramsey. I'm sorry, your honor. The defendant is not present. Very well. Bench warrant is issued. No bail. Next case. Well, I think that's it. He's on parole and in contempt of court. That should be enough to get his ticket punched. Will you let us know when he's arrested? I'll sleep a lot better when I know he's in jail. I sure will. I thank both of you for coming down. Sorry it was for nothing. At least he'll be off the street. -Thanks for your effort. -You bet. -Thank you. -Bye. -Bye. Sergeant! I just wanted you to know that I called and violated Ramsey's parole and I issued the teletype for a state-wide alert. -Better late than never. -And I'm going over to see his girlfriend. So am I. -You going over there now? -Uh-huh. Well, so am I. Well, actually just as soon as I walk over to my office and get myself a car, if there are any cars available. Actually at this time there probably aren't any cars available. I suppose you could come with me. What a good idea! Okay, it's no trouble? You don't mind? Good thing I can take a hint. I hope you don't mind riding in a police car. Well, I have heard they lean a little to the right. I'll make a couple of left turns, just for you. I'm sorry. I got tied up. Hey, that's okay. This is beautiful. -I've been enjoying the view. -Yeah. Cathy. I thought we were gonna have the whole day together. Unfortunately... It's okay. I'm sorry, Cathy, there's just... There's just no... Just no way for me to know. Listen. My hotel isn't that far from here. We could go there and talk. Come on, I'll drive. You travel light, don't you, Rob? Cathy. Cathy, I've never been unfaithful before, so I'm not very good at this. Listen. Maybe... Maybe... You can leave if you want. Hey. If you wanna be with me, just tell me. I understand. -It didn't take you long to get here. -Are you Sara Kates? No, I'm not Sara Kates, I'm Nancy Klinger. Aren't you the police? I called. I'm Sergeant Stockwell. You said you called. What's the problem? Something's wrong, that's the problem. -That's just a little vague. Could you... -Look at the porch! The paper's there. The mail's in the box. Sara didn't come in to work last night. She doesn't answer the phone and her car is in the garage. She's been having trouble with that guy she lives with. He got arrested, you know... She must have been out. And something's wrong! I know it! Sarge, how are you? Got a call to see the woman. Unknown trouble. -That's me. -This lady works with the woman who lives here. She didn't show up for work last night, won't answer her phone and her car's still in the garage. Her common-law is a paroled rapist. He's been violated. He didn't show up for court this morning and I have a bench warrant. It's your ballgame. I think we've got enough to look inside, so if you and your partner will cover the back, Paxton and I will take the front. Okay, give us a minute to get there. I don't like it. Something's wrong. Now, don't you worry about a thing. You just wait right here, okay? -Okay. -Okay. -Feel good? -Mmm-hmm. I already tried that. Don't you think if it was unlocked, I'd be inside? Police officers, Ms. Kates. Open the door. I told you I did that. Oh, my God. Okay, in here. Okay, now, don't touch anything and don't let anybody else in. What's wrong? What is it? -Are you all right? -Mm-hm. Okay, we're gonna need some names, addresses. Ramsey's family, his friends -his hangouts. -Sergeant I'm sorry. You can be sorry later. We've got a lot of work to do. Where's Sara? What's happened? Hello? Anybody home? Hi, I'm here! Where is everybody? Hi! Uh... Let's see. Barbara's at her mother's. Something to do with the wedding invitations, and... Okay, so what's on your mind? What do you mean, what's on my mind? You're standing there fully dressed playing with an apple I know you have no intention of eating so what's on your mind? You know something, Jennifer? You sure are a know-it-all. Comes with age. What do you think of married men? I think they make great husbands. Now, I'm serious. I met a wonderful guy. He's really something else. But he's married. Cathy. Dear, sweet Cathy. You are such an idiot! Jennifer I'm really being serious. I think Rob really cares about me. What he cares about has nothing to do with your personality. Now, you're not being fair. You don't even know him and... He's different. He's... He's a decent guy. He's not one of those flesh-hounds. Okay, I'll be objective. I'm sure Rob is a very nice man. That's fair. And if he cares for you, and you care for him then I'm really glad for you. But do you know him? I mean really know him? Will he divorce his wife? Will he share his life with you? Look, if it's just a fling okay! You're two consenting adults. Cathy. You're looking for something else and you're always getting hurt in the process. I'm sure he's a nice man. But nice men have needs, too. And he could just be using you for his needs and then rationalizing it as a beautiful affair while you die in bunches, waiting for his next call. Aw, Cathy. Sometimes you've got to say no. They're not all worth it. Look inside yourself. You're a good person. Believe that. You've just got to learn to say no. I know how to say no. I know that he's different and I know that he cares for me. Hey, he's coming over here tonight to meet my friends. This time it's different. Oh, Cathy. I sure hope so. I really hope so for your sake. Aw, Cathy. Okay, I need the names of each of his cellmates when and if they were released and I need an address or phone on each of them. And I needed it an hour ago. Well, do what you can and call me back. Okay, thank you. CP. That's mine! Where'd you find that? In Ramsey's closet. Quite a collection. Pin-ups panties, bras, lipstick. You... You mean he stole that from me during an office visit? It shakes your confidence in human character, huh? It shakes my confidence in me. -Yeah! -All right, all right. Whoo! Well, I spent most of the afternoon talking to Cathy. I don't know. I hate to sound like an instant shrink, but I think this thing she has with a married man has something to do with a search for a father she never really had. And her mother was nobody's prize package, either. For a girl who's searching for just one man, she sure hasn't been very selective. Oh, I know, there's no need to say it. I love Cathy like a sister but I don't have to like what she does. She's just this great big kid who refuses to grow up and she's headed for a fall. Well, well, well. If it isn't Betty Crocker and her little helper. And who are you, the Pillsbury Doughboy? -Touche. Okay, I deserved that. -Mmm-hmm. Listen. I am the bearer of some good news and some bad news. Tell us the good news. The good news, O'Hare is fogged in. They shut down about an hour ago, so we may not be going. What's the bad news? Well... You may not get to share the enchanting skies with me this evening. I thought you said you had some bad news. Hey, listen. I don't have to stay back here and suffer these insults. I can go up to the cockpit and be insulted by the captain. Advise Homicide, the suspect's car is located in parking lot C, off Oakland Avenue. I'll stand by at the scene. Roger 19-A4. Advising Homicide. 19-A4 roger. You worry about Cathy and well, the other night, you threw me this one-liner about marriage that really struck home. What about you? I mean, you can't go on doing this forever. You could get a desk job if you wanted to. I know. This is my whole life. It's all I have. I'm afraid if I were to quit flying, I'd find out I don't really have a life. I'm just not sure I want to face that. Yes! Uh, anything for pick-up? No! What are you doing here? Is... Is the tall girl here? The one with the blonde hair? Jennifer? No, she's out on a flight, but why do you want to see... Any of you featherless birds... Don't! Don't scream. Good afternoon. This is your handsome co-pilot and all-American virile male. All personnel may now de-plane because de plane ain't going nowhere. All females needing assistance with ground transportation please contact your nearest co-pilot. -Thank you. -Let's get a bite to eat. I wish we hadn't been dropped off. A taxi's gonna cost us a fortune. You heard what Steve said. Let's ask him for a ride home. May sure you check that I.D. Did anyone see anybody in this pick-up? No. When did you notice your van was gone? I saw the police coming, I told Gil and he came running over. Yeah, I thought they towed it away again. Man, it don't pay. But if the police don't tow it away, some joker steals it. Okay, Collins, put out an APB. Impound that piece of junk and let Prints work on it. Hey! Hey, what's gonna happen to us? We don't even have any clothes. We'll try to find your van. Collins, give them a ride home. Tell the watch commander I authorized it. My mom's never gonna believe it. Coming home in a police car? As long as you're quiet you won't get hurt. I don't wanna hurt anyone. Sweet dreams, ladies. -Thanks, Steve. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. -Thank you. Relax. Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you. Maybe they went out. Cathy said her friend was coming over tonight. It's dark in here. Ladies! If you have a gentleman in there, you're going to be sorry! Don't scream. Don't make a sound. Wait. Listen to me. I'll do anything you ask. Just don't hurt them. Please. Why? You didn't do anything. You treated me all right. -Just do what I say and you won't get hurt. -But... Cathy? Cathy? You try anything and I'll kill her. Operator. Operator. Help. Operator. Pick up. Is someone there? Hello? Help. Help. Vickie? I'm home! Honey? It's all your fault. You caused all of it. Don't try anything else. What's going on here? Go! No! Oh, my God. My God. Bedroom. Beth! Vickie? Vickie? Vickie, it's me. Alex. Vickie. -Detective. -Doc. Coffee? Thanks. How are they? Well, the girl that jumped through the window is the worst, physically. We're having a tough time with her blood pressure. I just stopped the bleeding. Not barring complications, she should make it. She's down at ICU. And the others? They're on the third floor. The blonde girl, Cathy. She's been raped beaten. She has a broken nose, massive contusions. Beth has also been beaten. She's just coming out of shock. Vickie Stevens? Several broken ribs broken finger, ruptured vessel. There's another, Barbara. She's untouched physically, but she's just silent. Just staring. Can I see them? Well, keep it short and don't press. When you see Mrs. Quinn on the ward, tell her I said it's okay. Thanks, doc. Sarge. I'm told one man did this. Is that true? Yeah, it looks that way. I'm glad you came. I think you can be of help. Jennifer? Jennifer, can you hear me? I'm Sergeant Stockwell. -I'm investigating... -Cathy? Beth? Vickie? Are they... They're doing just fine. Barbara? They're all here at the hospital but they're doing just fine. I'll see them in just a few minutes. Thank God. I thought he'd kill them. Thank God he didn't. Thank God. And you. Somebody had to do something. Could you tell us who it was? Did you know the man? Okay, just relax. Relax. I'm sorry. God, I wish I had her courage. If I'd listened to you and violated Ramsey when you first had him Sara Kates would be alive and these five women wouldn't be lying in here. I didn't have a case and you knew it and so did I. At the time, your job was to help him and mine was to try to keep him from hurting anybody else. Now, that's not your fault, it's not my fault. You knew he was guilty. I'm his parole officer. I couldn't even tell. I'm supposed to know my job. You just got your nose bloody, that's all. This is just the beginning. Your degree in psychology taught you something about human nature. Well, your job as a parole officer is going to teach you something about the realities of the world in which we live. But I can't handle it! Look at me. There's nothing wrong with the way you're feeling. I mean, what kind of human being would you be if you weren't upset? But don't waste it, learn from it. Put it to use. My problem with the job is that the system was becoming too one-sided. They were too eager to protect and too reluctant to punish. But I can't help it. I just feel so damn guilty! I feel guilty, too! I should have known where he went. I could have done more. Those are the kind of feelings that come with the job. You care, Paxton, and that's why you're here. And that's why you're gonna stay. Once you told me when you went to bed at night, you slept well because you always did your best. Remember? Well, I don't think you'll sleep too much tonight if you walk away from your job. You gotta hang in here and do the best you can to make this system work for everybody. Sergeant. You should have my degree in psychology. Come on. Cathy's in 356. Barbara, 358. Beth, 357. Vickie Stevens, 354. If you need anything, just ring. Thank you, Mrs. Quinn. Glad to help. Cathy? I'm Sergeant Stockwell. I'm trying to find the man who hurt you and your friends. Can you tell me what he looked like? Had you ever seen him before? No. Why? Why? Why did he pick me? What did I do to him? I didn't do anything to him. Why did he pick me? Why me? Sergeant. Before you go in do you know she hasn't spoken? She doesn't respond. The doctor told me. This may help. Would you like to give it to her? Thank you, Mrs. Quinn. Barbara? Barbara, we're trying to find the man who attacked you and your friends. Can you tell us anything? Barbara? We want to find him so he can't do this again. Can you help us? It's okay. You don't have to talk about it. I understand. This came for you. Do you want it? I'll read it to you. "Barbara. "I thank God you're all right. "I was on 192 to Miami when Operations called. "By the time you read this, I'll be on my way home. "You are my love and my life "and soon you'll be my wife. "I love you. "Bud." Thank goodness. She won't take the sedative the doctor prescribed until she talks to you. I told her you wanted to talk to her. -I had to be awake. -It won't put you to sleep. -I know. I had to be awake. -It's all right, Beth. Is there anything you can tell me about the man who attacked? I don't know his name but he works for the Sea View Drycleaners. He's a delivery man. He was waiting in my house when I got there. He had the girls tied up. I tried to help them but I wasn't strong enough to do anything. Slow down just a minute, okay? I want him found. He had no right to do that to us. He was waiting. That bastard was waiting! He has to pay for this! I want him found! You understand me? I want him found! I want him found! He has to pay! I want him found! Her reaction was based on hysterical shock. She was attack by a man. You're a man. It has nothing to do with her feelings now. Thank you, doctor. Alex? Vickie? Alex. Alex. Hold me, hold me, hold me. I love you. I love you. Well, I feel a lot older. Just hope I'm a little wiser. You did fine, but we're not out of the woods yet. We gotta find him. We? That's right. We both got a problem now. Unit to south-west. Please identify. 2117 east... Hi, Sarge. What do you got, Collins? I took a burglary report over 6th and Elm this morning.
