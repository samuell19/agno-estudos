Tristan Martin, age 16 1/2, missing from home since the 24th. Brown hair. Height, five feet 10 inches. He takes dope, right? I don't think so. Ever watch your son shower? Sorry? In his shower... to see if there are needle marks. Sorry, I don't watch him in the shower. Is he homosexual? I have nothing against them. It's just to know where to look. He was in love with a girl. Maybe they left together. They met two months ago at a rock concert. She's a wild kid, very unsavory. Her name? Michele Raffart. She's from Nice. Know her folks? I called her father this morning. He hung up on me. He runs a hotel in Nice, the Riviera. He strikes me as a weirdo too. I'll ask the Nice police to drop in on him. I'll put theJuvenile Squad on it. Then we wait. You think you'll find him? We always find them. It's like stolen cars. But when? - It's useless. - Don't be silly. They ignore runaways. We'll go see the girl's folks. We can't go to Nice. Let the police do it. "Like stolen cars." You got your stolen car back, but it was a mess. Mr. Raffart? Paul Martin. I phoned you about my son. The cops came this morning. You send them? I told them my son may have left with your daughter. I don't know where she is. She's her own boss. Why don't people get off my back? We're worried about our son. You can understand that. I don't know your son. I never saw anybody. Now quit bugging me. Got me? - I told you so. - Lies! He's lying. Make him tell the truth. Go on. I won't fight him. We can't force him to talk. - You're a bastard! - Hold on. I hope you get treated this way someday. It's private here. Maybe you can't help... but you've no right to treat us like dogs. If I were a man I'd sock you. My plumber's on the phone. The second floor pipes are leaking. I got problems too. Screw you, lady. Come on. A private detective? Mrs. Bertheaud's girl had a good one for her divorce. Want his address? I did something dumb, mom. What? I phoned Lucas, Jean Lucas. You used to call him the cave man. He's doing well. He's a journalist. Seems very happy. Why'd you call him? To ask his help. I'm seeing him at 5:00. His help? If he'd been with me in Nice... my son would be home now. How long since you've seen him? I don't know, 17 years. Which do you prefer? I don't want to hurt you... but why should he help you after 17 years? Or bother about a kid he doesn't know? - I'll say he's his. - What? I'll tell him Tristan is his son. His name's Tristan. He's 17. I didn't want to tell you then. I kept him. We raised him. Why? I wanted a child by you. No, why didn't you tell me? You were so young. Can you see yourself as a family man then? So I married Paul. He never knew it wasn't his son. It's crazy. Got a photo? Sure, but... it's not a very good one. Something there, no? - The nose. - No such luck. It's his expression. When he smiles, he's you. Got a photo of him smiling? He's handsome, you know, very. Why are you telling me now? He ran away two weeks ago. The police don't care and Paul isn't man enough. I want my son back. Ran away. That's a bitch. I think he left with a girl, from Nice. I went to Nice with Paul, but... What do you expect me to do? I want you to look for him. You'll find him. You're not for real. After 17 years you tell me I have a kid... then that he's gone... and you ask me to find him. I don't know what to say. He refused. Never mind, it figured. I remember him very well... selfish little brute. You couldn't expect much of him. He's not a brute and he's not selfish. All right. Let's drop it. Want something to drink? I'll make coffee. I knew another boy then... Francois Pignon. - Remember him? - Not again. He was very sweet, very... Always committing suicide? I wonder what's become of him. "I'm sick of this life that's given me so little." I leave it with no regrets. Forgive me, all of you who love me. Farewell. "Francois. '" Who's this? Christine, it can't be. It's been so long! No, I'm not lunching. I'm not doing badly. No, you're not bothering me. What are you up to? Whenever you like. This afternoon if you wish. 5:00 p. M.? Okay, I'll be there. I could hug you too. I'm glad you called. See you later. He's 17. His name is Tristan. I have a son? You had my kid and didn't tell me? I couldn't, then. We were a complicated pair. Walking out, attempting suicide. You left, I tried suicide. Well, I preferred not to tell you. A son! Got a photo? But it's not a very good one. Something there, no? The eyes, maybe. He has your eyes. Looks as if he has black eyes, right? Yes, but the same shape. - Black coffee again. - What? He always forgets the cream. That's not so serious. Not at all, but... I just had a breakdown. I'm fine now, but... sometimes I cry for no reason. The doctor said it was normal... that I'll get over it. Where is he? Why isn't he here? - Are you okay? - Perfectly! Where is he? I mustn't do this to you. You have problems too. Stop it! I have no problems. Where's my son? He ran away. I wanted help, but if you can't... You thought of me. Great! Of course! I'm the father! I forgot! I can't get used to the idea. You don't know how happy I am. Waiter! Terribly sorry. Check, please. Of course I'll help find our son. Sure you can? I'm fine, I tell you. Terrific! It means going to Nice. Okay? Sure! We're in luck: I've no job, my wife left me... I live with my mother and hate it... I've no plans, no future. Everything's screwed up. Great, isn't it? Casino war's on again. I know. - Who's going? - Dubois. It's not his style at all. He didn't do a book on it. The Riviera hoods don't hate him. Those hoods don't scare me. Let me cover it. And get shot in the gut? Who'd care? I have no wife, no kids. I'll beat the mob. Bet you a case of champagne. Order it now. I'll order a wreath. I can give you number 12... or six. Boss not here? He's busy. Is it urgent? No, I'll see him later. Take room six. It's quieter. Hi, Verdier! A louse like you in a posh hotel! You've got nerve, showing up here again. My book's a hit. I'll do a sequel. Sure, your last installment. You doing all right? - Working? - Calling girlfriends. They're all busy. I can't get stuck eating with you. I'm busy too. I'm on duty. Stop by police HQ I'll buy you a sandwich. Isabelle. Pity she's not free. Madagascar Indian, a doll! She's tomorrow. You do all right... no family... a girl in every port. You've really made out. Here's what you wanted. I swiped it, so get it back to me. - Thanks. - Don't get killed. I won't. Rossi will try to buy me first. Take the money and run. Thanks for getting here so fast. She's out. Who's calling? She'll be back here later. What's it about? I'm an old friend. I heard of the trouble with your son. I'm in Nice. Maybe I can help. - Boss wants to chat. - I don't. He has a proposition for you. Rossi's propositions don't interest me. One second. Do you know this boy? - Why? - I'm his dad. He ran off with your daughter. His dad! Yes. Heard from them lately? I saw his father two weeks ago. That was just the man who raised him. I'm the real father. - Well? - Like I told the other father... get off my back with this business. You going to keep bugging me? Don't get mad. I talked to the cops. I don't want to be bothered. Got that? I've got work to do. Get out of here. - Who's calling? - Give me that. The plumber. Beat it, you! Hang on, I'll put him on. Sorry, he's busy. Any message? - Wait, here he is now. - Help! He's gone again. Bad luck! Say something. Make him happy. - He came. - What? Your son. He came... with two other guys and my daughter. They slept here one night... then I tossed them out. Why didn't you tell his mother? They had stolen goods with them. They must have broken into a store... radios, tape recorders. I should have told the cops... but I don't want trouble. So I told everyone I haven't seen them. - Where are they? - I don't know. Try a little harder. My wife. Maybe she's seen them. She's got a gas station on the Cannes road. The Agip station. What is it? Mr. Raffart? Sorry, but maybe you could help me. Ever seen this boy? - Who are you? - His father. He ran away with your daughter, it seems. Is something wrong? - How many fathers he's got? - What? Oh, I get it. The father you met isn't the real one. The real daddy who made him is me. Not answering? Sorry. That guy's nuts! What's going on? I ask a question, he hits me with the phone. He's mental! You okay? My son ran away. I have a right to inquire! I'll go to the police! Your son ran away? That idiot broke my jaw! - Mine ran away too. - No kidding? They must all be together. How old's yours? - Sixteen. - So's mine. - Pignon. - Lucas. - Glad to know you. - Same here. - Let's discuss our kids. - Gladly. You might knock. Want us to knock? No, I know. You're that kid's dad too. Everyone's his dad! Give me back that phone, please. It wasn't made for that. Raffart says they stole things in a store: Radios, tape recorders. I think our kids are taking a wrong turn. - What will I tell his mother? - That's how I feel. Poor Christine, it's been rough on her. She's called Christine? Mine's called Christine too. Poor Christine. - I neglected my kid. - Same here, sad to say. They need us. Especially mine. He's a dreamer. I was the same at his age, moody, alienated. I wrote poetry. He went one better. He had the guts to leave. He's me, but less uptight, more free. Mine's a little brute. Strong as an ox, a fighter. Just like I was. Couldn't stay still. When I found out he'd run away. I said, "Just like my son!" My dad gave me this watch when I was 18. He got it from his dad. I'm giving it to him. I'll get him a job at the paper. Do him good. I'll help him. From now on I'll take care of him. I'll take care of him too. We'll never be alone again, neither of us. - Any news? - Not much. Some guy called. Jean Lucas, from Nice. What about? About Tristan. Who is he? Just a guy I knew a long time ago. Meeting you was a big help. It's good that our sons are buddies. It'll be easier to find them. - Great car! - I splurged. Brand new BMW. I'm breaking it in. It's superb! - I'd have had metallic gray. - Not me! We're out of gas. - What? - We're running out of gas. We're out of gas? Don't worry, we'll go to a gas station. That's not why... I cry because I just got over a nervous breakdown. I'll snap out of it, don't worry. Fill it up with hi-test. I want to check it out. No point. Lucas isn't married, and has no kids. It's a trick. And the other guy? Another nosy reporter, I'll bet. She won't be easy. - Think not? - I know. Anything else? - You're Mrs. Raffart? - Yes. - Your husband phoned you? - My husband? He sent us. - I'm Lucas. My son ran away. - I'm Pignon, so did mine. They were at your husband's with your girl. We split up 15 years ago! - Heard from your daughter lately? - No. - I want my son back. - Me too. Your daughter can help us. I don't know where she is. I got work to do, and you owe me 300 francs. I told you. - Maybe it's true. - I doubt it. But how do we make her talk? What if you cried a bit? - What? - Maybe tears will soften her. - Cry? Just like that, now? - Right. - I can't. - You cried when I ran out of gas! I can't cry on cue! If you don't cry, she won't talk. Let's go! Wait. I'll try. - Hurry! - What do you mean, hurry? I have to think of something sad. Let's see. What's gotten into you? I've been crying for months... driving people nuts. And when I have to... My father's funeral. It was so sad. Makes me cry every time. Not this time! The jerk slapped me! We might as well leave. Here she is. I'm sorry. I haven't had this much fun in ages! I'm crying with laughter! - Your tank's full. You can leave. - Come on. I need a tissue. What's with him? He's very upset. Calm down. Easy now. - He's crying? - Of course he's crying! His son ran away, and you won't help him! My daughter might have trouble with the cops! We won't tell the police. You have my word. Know the "Video Flip"? A kids' hangout, with video games. She's always there. I'll get you the address. I must've met your sons. What do they look like? Got a phone? Oh, it's you. I phoned, but you'd left. Listen, I'm short of change I'm with Pignon. He says he's your son's father! I can explain... Just say who the father is: Your husband, Pignon or me? I don't know! Just get my son back, that's all I ask! I knew all three of you then. Any of you could be his father. We'll settle it later! Get him back! You don't know who his father is? Screw that kid! I'm here to work for my paper! I'm busy. He was a passing interest. Leave that seat belt alone! I like my bachelor life. Who needs kids! Suits me. I'll take this one. I loved her and she was dating two other guys. - And what guys! - Thanks. Some nerve. Know him? - Why? - He ran away from home. - You cops? - No, he's my son. His mom sent us. - You owe me 1000 francs. - What? Those creeps smashed my window. They were zonked. They smashed my window! - Who's "they"? - Bunch of crazies. I don't know what they were on, but... I'm not insured, so pay up! Sure he was along? He was as high as a kite. My kid doesn't stay out late and get high on dope! Keep an eye on your brat! - I raise my kid my way! - Don't argue! Don't lecture me, asshole! Kids stay out to play your dumb video games! You'll get the beating your son deserves.- Yeah? Gentlemen, please. I was on the army boxing team. I bet his windows are insured. Where do we find him? I don't know. They crash in a shack in the St. Paul district. Try there. If he's on dope... A good hiding will straighten him out. - Were you a marine? - You're for a liberal education? Respect his personality... or he'll develop a block. Block, my ass! Why did that guy sock you? To find his son. He has no son! What did he want? I'll leave my car here. It's safer. Don't slam the door. You'll damage it. Think he's in there? Nobody's here. Shall we go back up? No, wait. What is it? - Can you help us find someone? - Fuck off! The marines smash the door? - There are other ways. - Go ahead. Got 100 francs? Fuck off! Try sending him a dozen roses. - What would you do? - This. We're looking for him. The "Rockers." It's a roller rink. They're all there at chow time. Canal St. "Rockers." For the door. Christ! I'll kill the guys who did it! I don't see him. Chick at the bar. Yes? Could be his girlfriend. We're in for trouble. - Why? - Ugly bunch. I'll take care of it. What? I was a school teacher. I can handle kids. This is my bag. You'll get killed. I tell you I can handle it. Just stay out of it. Hi, kids. How's tricks? Bitchin' music! What a beat! Far out! Can I talk to you? Your mom sent us. Come on. No rough stuff. Want a drink? I said no rough stuff. What are you doing? Really. That's very funny. Eat it. We're looking for a young man, Tristan. - Who? - Tristan. He's upstairs. Upstairs! Get rid of that jerk! He's been bugging us for a month. The stairs outside! - He's up there. - I heard. Stop eating that thing! See? No rough stuff. Take him away. - He left with you? - Yeah, but that's all over. I'm with Stephane now. Tristan won't let go of me. He got drunk on beer. He can't take it. When he passed out, we put him up here. Take him back to Paris or Stephane will murder him. Don't waste your breath. He's out. That's not how I saw him. How does he strike you? - And you? - Not much, is he? No, not much. He's weird-looking. - Looks a bit like you. - Not at all. - He's waking up. - No. Poor little fella. Tough break. First time I got drunk, it was over love. - Really? - Stayed drunk three weeks. He did the same. We react alike. Doesn't prove a thing. Okay. I only said we had things in common. Like what? You're both drunks. If every drunk was your kid... you'd have quite a family. You're getting on my nerves. Let's get him out of here. How? Something wrong? My son! Drunk! He weighs a ton. He's well-built. Small, but solid. Built like me. No, he's fine-boned. You have big bones. Look at his wrists. Look at that! - He attempted suicide. - What a jerk. You don't understand. He's sensitive, like me. I took up suicide at his age. You're no good at it. My poor boy. He needs sleep. Like me. I have to be up early. Go to bed. I'll take care of him. I have to sleep on the sofa. Ridiculous. When did she see you? - What? - His mother. - What day was it? - Wednesday. Then I'm his father. - How come? - I saw her on Tuesday. So she came to me first. As I wasn't available, she went to you. It's obvious. Would you pick a guy like me to find your runaway son? - What? - Would you pick me for the job? No chance. Then why did she pick me? Because I'm his father. It's obvious. Look. He's waking up. - What will we say? - Nothing. We'll get him home and then see. Want some coffee? It'll do you good. I'm an old friend of your mother's... Francois Pignon. Call me Francois. I'm Jean. Also an old friend of your mom's. Coffee for three, please. She's waiting for you. We told her we'd found you. She's ecstatic. We brought you to the hotel last night. You the police? Friends of your mother's. She'll tell you in Paris. You came to St. Paul and kidnapped me? No, you were asleep. We didn't want to wake you. Don't be afraid. We're just returning you to your folks. - Open the door! - Don't shout. If you're not the police, you can't keep me here! Open the door. What right do you have? I'm your father! Hold it there. I don't agree. You can't say you're his father. Sorry, I don't agree. I said it because he wants to take off. Then tell him I'm his father. It's just as likely! Why should I say that when it may be me? Find a phrase. Say, "We're your father." What's all this crap? Maybe we should tell him. You're old enough to understand. I met your mother 17 years ago and I may be your father. But there's a problem: I may also be your father. Yes? Who is it? It's his father. Yes, he's awake. I'll put him on. He just left! Call you back! You have quite a son. My son? That's what you say. I'm not chasing after that kid. I've got work. - Do your work. I'll go. - All alone? He'll go back there to danger. They'll make you eat your shoe. They won't. I'll fight. - I'll get my son back. - My son. Sure. Mr. Lucas, telephone. I'll come with you. I'll be a minute. - I don't need you. - I'm coming anyway. - Dimwit. - Jerk. Where are you going? To the john, okay? - What's this? - I'm off to Nice. I look like a fool. He walks out on us, and you send two idiots to find him. If you get involved, he'll resist more. What did I do to him? I raised him well. He had everything he wanted. He was a lousy student, stayed out all night. Those guys have it made. He gave me 16 years of hell... and now they smell like roses. I'll trade any day. Two guys with razors in the john. Look what they did. - Call the police! - Come on. - What were they like? - Horrible! Ruined my suit and commented on my nose! Your nose? They said: "Keep your nose clean." I know no one here. Keep my nose clean? This is my only suit. Call the police! Take it easy. I know the cops here. I'll do it. Here. Wear that for now. It may be a bit big. Seen Michele? Something wrong? Guess what. I got kidnapped. I swear, two guys. One was a big hunk, the other a real weirdo. I thought they were cops. The big one said he was my dad. Then it got crazy. The other one said he was my dad too. But I got away. - You dressed? - I look idiotic! No, you don't. Come on. The kid will think I'm ridiculous. He won't even notice. Let's go. They didn't even take my wallet! Why me? Mr. Lucas? It's Jeannot. I've got something for you. Come to the casino. I'll be here. Hurry. It's worth it. Very good. It won't take a minute, I tell you. This car depresses me. Lucas! He's been gone two hours. You may be his dad, but don't act like his mom. I'll be back. The other snoop's still there. You didn't say there were two. Now who's parked there? He'll be right back. Can't you read? "Garage exit." Move it! I'm in a hurry! Move that goddamn wreck. Shit, the BMW! Lucas? - We're taking you to see Rossi. - Lucas? It's not my fault. I swear. Don't touch me. Here's a tip. Rossi was protected by Couderc. - What's that worth? - What? I'm as good as dead now. I have to split. What will you pay me? I'm sorry, I don't have any money. You bastard. You fooled me. Bastard. Now I have to kill myself. Beat it! You're a depressive. What? So am I. Francois Pignon. Forty-eight hours ago, I had a gun in my mouth. Tell me your troubles. It'll do you good. You putting me on? I can help you, if you tell me more. More? What more can I say? Yes, wait. I've got something. It's big. - It'll blow everything sky high. - Very good. But I'll need help. Where can I reach you? We've had a little problem. What happened this time? It suddenly took off. - You forgot the hand brake. - I did? What else could it be? Let's go. It's running. Quite a car. - How did it go? - So-so. I chatted with a depressive. There are so many these days. Where's Michele? - You're back? - Where's Michele? I'm asking you. Touch me again and you're dead. What's going on? - Do something! - Don't move! If he's my son, he'll do okay. If he's mine, he won't! - They'll kill him! - Don't, you'll make a fag of him. Cut that macho crap. Let go! Don't call me macho, egg-head. You okay? Nice going, kid! You okay? My arm. Stop pacing! They said it wasn't serious. I don't know them. I won't leave with them. Sorry. - Want your parents to come? - Or the cops? Okay. But I won't go home. Are you family? - Maybe, yes. - Maybe? Yes, we're family. Come on. Please. Who are you? You see, Doctor... long ago, when this lad's mother was a girl... - Okay. I'm his uncle. - Me too. That true? Yes. I won't go back to my parents in Paris. Let's grab a bite. I'm hungry. They really did a job on it. Get in. I'm splitting. Thanks for everything. Alone, with a broken arm. Those guys and that girl don't want you. My dad kept bugging me for 16 years. Don't you start. He's in love. What can we do? He has to come back on his own. Go back to Paris. I'll finish my piece. Let's let him be. Before my breakdown, I was a teacher. - Those kids wore me down. - So? They were rough street kids. They called me "the turd." I swore off kids for life. Then this one shows up, I feel reborn. I don't care if you're right. I'm going after him. I need him. Let him turn me down. Quit following me. Not while you're unhappy. I won't annoy you or speak to you. I'll wait outside if you want. Why bother? This father business is a gag. Maybe. Get out of here. Now! Fuck you. In five seconds I'll break your other arm. No violence, please. One... - two... - Let him be. He's hurt. You still hungry? He tried to bean me. See that, you guys? You tried to bean me? He did it again. It's not like that. There's an art to beaning. You're doing this... - The power comes from here. - Listen, grandpa. There. What is it now? Come here, you. You dumped him and he doesn't know it. Fill him in. It's over. That's how it is. We're through. Let's go, kid. - Get lost. - Come on. Get lost! - Come on, let's go home. - I smashed your car. What? - It was parked in St. Paul's. - What's this? It was shiny new. The whole gang busted it! Don't listen to him. He's needling you. I swear by my three fathers! I smashed it yesterday, on St. Paul's square! With a crowbar. Don't hit him. His arm's broken. Let's go or I'll get mad. Come on, kid. Sleep here. We'll decide tomorrow. Stop, men don't cry. Cry, it'll do you good. Let him rest. Don't rattle him. Leave it to me. It's Jeannot. Hi, there. Are we feeling better? Warehouse St. In the phone booth. Come quick. Who is it? - My depressive. - What? - The guy I met. - Really? He sounds sick. I can't abandon him. I know. I've been there. Once a garbage man saved me. I really wanted to die. I had to talk to someone. - He'd come for his Christmas gift. - Some gift. Do you know Warehouse Street? Don't play good fairy in the slums! I must go. I'll be back as soon as I can. You okay? Want a drink? I have to get out of here. I need air. Hard with one hand. Do what you want. See you. Research. I'm a reporter. It's a good life. We'll discuss it later. That's Rossi. I wrote a book on him. He didn't like it. That's Senator Coudere. He's covering that bastard. If I can prove it, I've got them. So my mother had three guys at once. At once is going too far. So who's my father? Let me tell you, your mother's a good person. She was good to lots of guys. Don't judge people - I'm glad. She had fun before marrying creepo. - Wait for me. - Not in this neighborhood. That's 40 francs. I can do it. Hurry. I have to meet a cop. You come too. - No, thanks. - I have a plan. To get you a job at the paper. - He's dead! - What? My depressive. He killed himself! - Where are you? - Warehouse St. I called the cops. They haven't come. You give your name? To the cops. Then beat it. Scram! - Why? - Don't ask. I know the cops. Scram! What a dummy. He gave me an envelope. As he was dying. What do I do with it? You opened it? What an ass! You're asking for cop trouble. Tear it up! Get rid of it! - I hope he's not your father. - Why? Guy kills himself, and he yells "cop." They'll pin it on him. - What's funny? - Him. He doesn't amuse me. Two days with him is plenty. - Hurry up. - I won't go out. You must. They worked over that idiot, you may be next. Come see a reporter at work. Look who's here. Hi. Inspector Verdier, my son. You have a son? He break your arm? Some fun, your dad. - Go to hell. - You okay? Perfect. Here's your stuff. Thanks. How do the clap and a crow differ? - I'll bite. - Try catching a crow. - A drink? - Hang on. Like journalism? Swapping stupid jokes with a dumb cop? Thrilling. - Know Renacci? - Jeannot? - He got killed. - Let's go. Like in the movies, no? Nothing interests kids today. - Didn't know you had a son. - Neither did I. - What? - Never mind. - Where are we going? - Warehouse St. There you are. I was worried. - Describe your guy. - It's awful. Describe him! Relax. I tore up the papers and threw them away. - Just as you said to. - But what did he look like? Dark little guy, checkered shirt? That's right. Short, dark, checkered shirt. Come with me. Where's the goddamn photo? I don't know which can it's in. I'm tired. Shut up. Don't bother me now. You a garbage man? The little jerk's getting on my nerves. I didn't ask to come. It's true. It's not his fault. Scram, both of you. You bug me. I don't want to be his father. I'm sick of having doors slammed on me. He's yours. But don't kid yourself... you won't get past the door. And insisting will get you nowhere. - What will you do? - My job. I've got many garbage cans to keep me busy. Good luck. - Let's go home. - I can find my own way. You're right, Lucas. It's hopeless. A ready-made kid, too good to be true. Fatherhood must be earned. Tristan, you left because your dad bugged you... and suddenly there are two more underfoot. So I'll leave you in peace. Good luck. Good-bye, kid. Is this it? The two bastards together in one photo. Fantastic! There's more. A letter from Jeannot... telling all about Rossi, Couderc. Either I get a raise or you're all bums. I'll send you the stuff. We've got the bastards. - You'll have to lie low a while. - Lie low? Until I finish the job. On your feet. Getting my suit slashed, was that because of you? Yes, maybe. And you didn't tell me? Killers after me and you didn't tell me? How could I know? Our son's in danger, and you want to run that photo? - You're a murderer. - But I'm going to hide you. - Give it to me. - You nuts? You can't endanger the kid for a story. Don't be stupid! I won't drop the scoop of a lifetime. Give it or it's war. Who will you nail with that photo? A cheap politico and a killer. A few days in the country won't kill us. I hope not. Don't look so sad, Pignon. When it's over you can live with me. - I have a big place. - Okay. - Stop the car. - What? What's wrong? Since I don't figure in your plans, I'll leave. Where's the dimwit going? What's eating you? - Just relax. - Everybody out! Son! Pignon, are you all right? Can you hear me? They removed the bullet. He's out of danger. Are you his son? - Yes, I'm his son. - He wants to see you. Come close, my boy. Closer. It hurts to talk. Stand beside me. Take this watch. It's yours. My father gave it to me... I'm giving it to you to remember me by. I'd like to have known you better. But life decided against it. Life is cruel. - Please don't cry. - He's a weeper. Screw you! I'd like you to go and see my mother. I told her about you. She's in Paris. She'd love to meet you. She'll be alone now. I can see you in the mirror. Sorry, but the nurse told us you were out of danger. I get shot because of you and you make fun of it? Why not unhook the drip too? I'm sorry for what happened to you. Please forgive me. Tell me what you want and I'll do it. Nothing. There's nothing you can do for me. You'll live with Tristan... and I'll recover all alone. I'm used to being alone. Like a dog. You making fun too? Can you put me up for a while? I'd like that. That's possible. Once I came home with my ear pierced. What a scene.! He always bugged me. I'm sure he's a decent guy. It took me years to realize that my dad was. - Anyway, he's not my dad. - That's true. When I was a kid... I wrote letters to my father. I'd crumple them up and drop them in the waste basket. I hoped he'd find them there. Dumb, wasn't it? The start of your trash can habit? Did he find the letters? Never. Complicated, all that. You all right? I'm coming home. Is Mom in? She's gone out. You with Pignon and Lucas? You know the situation? I pity them. We must tell them the truth when you get here. I'll talk to them. Please don't tell them anything. I'll do it. See you tonight. I've learned a lot. Me too. Lucas is coming. I'll get my bag. I just talked to my mother. You called her. Good. She told me the truth, who my father is. Who is it? You. She's sure of it. Should we tell Lucas? Maybe it's better to keep it to ourselves. You're right. It's much better. We mustn't hurt him. Rossi's been arrested. I got a raise. My story's a little masterpiece. I'm happy for you. Bravo. You deserve a kiss for that. What a pretty tie. It suits you. You're very elegant. - Are you okay? - Sure. You're a very good man. Thanks. You ready? I'll just be a minute, little friend. - Is he drunk? - I think he's glad to be leaving. He seems fine. Look. Rossi, the gambling king, arrested in Nice. - I phoned my mother. - That's good. She told me who my father is. She's sure it's you. I couldn't tell Pignon. He's so depressed. You did right. Absolutely right. Let's go. Something wrong? Everything's fine. Not depressed? A gnat in my eye, that's all. I feel great. You look marvelous too. Very handsome. - Nice of you. - I mean it, very handsome. When's Father's Day?
