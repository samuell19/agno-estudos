One More Day All that time, I did go back and forth. What have I done wrong? I left in the morning. I came home in the evening. I arrived in time for the call. What have I done wrong? You were so nice ... No one had ever been that. Come on, let me go. I can not stay. I won't let you down. I'm not going to play around. I have a patient at home, I have to go. I will return tonight. I'll be there for the call. I won't even be five minutes late. Let me go. I still have four years. I won't spoil it. I don't want to end up in jail or on the scaffold. I'm a man of honor in fact. And I care about my honor. Yes I'm listening. Okay. Gynaecological clinic, you're welcome. - You wish? - A plug. - For what service? - The car... cardiology. - His name? - Faramarz Taghi-Pour. - What worries you so much? - He will die. But no. - Why? It goes really wrong. - No, don't worry. Answer the phone. Hello Madam. It's for a patient named ... Faramarz Taghi-Pour. What state is it? His mother is here. She wants to ride. She insists. Ask the responsible for permission. I'm his wife, not his mother! I know. Go to the official. Or? Let's ask Mr. Khorasani at the information desk. One person, please. Sign the discharge and get your patient. Come up afterwards. Sign the discharge. For whom is this? Sir, what do you want? No, visits are in the afternoon, not in the morning. The doctors are consulting now. There are too many people. Sit there to let the people pass. - I want a sheet. - To do what? - To get a patient. - What is his name? Samad Zadeh. You have still not answered. Do you know Bazaar Haj Mehdi? - No. - I want to shop there. - Don't you know it? - No. - Where is the Haj Mehdi bazar? - Do you want to go there? - Yes. - You are wrong, then. What should I do? Hello Driver, stop the bus! Stop please! Stop the bus! Stop now. We've asked already ten times. You must stop at the bus stop. Sir, stop the bus. You are wasting my time. What kind of driver is this who doesn't stop? Excuse me. Thank you very much. Stop the bus! My legs hurt, I have tensions. What does that mean? But thank you, thank you. A misfortune never comes alone. She is paralysed, her nerves don't react anymore. I understand. And we can't find her medication. I left in the morning to look for medication and came back at night. I looked everywhere. Even if I found them, I wouldn't have enough money to buy everything. Yesterday I had a hard time to get here. I took a wrong bus. By the time I arrived, it was too late. It was not better, by injection? This ticket is torn. Get it going. Pass it to someone. Hello. I'll have some cigarettes. - You've shaved your moustache. - Does it suit me? Here. Can you put them in an envelope? - So it suits me well? - Yes. Quickly, I've work to do. Here. The ticket is torn. Give it to someone else. You should see my brother. When? Or? I've been running all the time. I have not even enough money for a taxi. The bus takes forever to arrive. You think I'm lying or that I tell stories ... Yesterday, when I saw my wife, she didn't even recognize me. One could have said she was no longer of this world. I don't understand anything about her illness. They say that with medication, her death would be more gentle. One more day. Grant me another day of leave to take care of my business. One more day. You are there? I told you to pick up the broken glass in the office. I have work, I must go. I will do it tomorrow. You will do it right away. But I can not! lmpossible. First the broken glass. Pick up the broken glass. I have to go. But Mr. Taghi will pick it up. Why should he pick it up? Do it yourself! Who is it? It's me. Still you? Doctor, the yellow pills, they're better than injections. Hello. - Did you find the Mostafa the Black? - Why do you ask? Don't forget me, huh. - What happened to your hand? - Nothing. I cut myself. I'll be there right away. The yellow pills would be better as injections. It doesn't exist as injection. You have pain all the time? You know that I need it. Use a plaster to avoid infection. I'm leaving. Will you try to get the injections? I'll see what I can do. Hello. How's it going? What do you have? It doesn't look so good. You're not as usual. Let me do it. Mr. Houshang, your tea is ready! I'll do it myself. Mr. Houshang, may I have one of your cigarettes? Since when do you smoke this brand? Two teas, please. Please, brother, can you give me a cigarette? Wait, I have to explain something. It is not possible here. I know, but it can't go on like this. I have not much time. Hello, you want some? - No. - It's cheap. There are other models. I don't want, go away. No need, go away. Hello. You look irritated. I'm not well. The meat is better today. I will do it. Just do something else. - What happened to your hand? - I cut myself. -You're going to go on like that? -That's life, you know. The bus is broken. Everybody get out. Listen... Can I walk to Toup Khaneh? Can I walk to Toup Khaneh? I don't know. I must explain something to you. I'm not who you think I am. Nor the one who's talking to you. I'm going to the market. I had a wife. She is dead. - You've got medications? - Me, for sale? No! Pills... drugs of all kinds ... Viagra 50, Viagra 100, Welcome 1, Welcome 2 ... Pills, drugs... Sir, like some pills? Excuse me, I'm looking for Mostafa. Which one? Hard or soft? - Brown haired. - Are you drugged? Drugged? No, I want to talk with Mostafa. - I've got the green ones ... - No, I want to meet Mostafa. - What is going on? - I think he's drugged. Are you drugged? I'm not. Where is Mostafa? -He wants to buy Mostafa for us. -Mostafa is pretty cheap. Mehdi has some dope. He'll take thousand. We will satisfy you. I want to see Mostafa. - Show us a sample. - Don't pretend. Give us the sample. - You know Mostafa? - He's a fraud. Don't waste your time. Do you want to pull a stunt, or what? He has some dope. Do you know Mostafa? - Mostafa the Black? - Yes. Yes, I know him. He is from this side. So it's Black Mostafa you're looking for? - Yes it's him. - I can get you drugs too. - No, I want to talk to him. - I'm also a dealer. I want speak to Mostafa. Okay. Wait here, I'll be back. Hey, long time no see! Are you still looking for those drugs? No. I'm looking Mostafa. Mostafa? Mostafa the Black? Yes. The cops were after him and he moved. I can show you where he is. He is at the other side of the bazaar. I've been looking for him since this morning. He's on the other side. I'll show you. - Let's go? - Yes please. What are you doing here? Mostafa, I'm in trouble, I need money. What are you doing in this mess here? I'm in trouble, I need money. Where do you want me to find it? Go away! We're in trouble, you should not be here. I have no choice. Don't you understand anything? They released me on bail. So you can't do anything? Go away, we're in trouble. I'll come to you tomorrow. Give me some cigarettes. Here. Thank you. Has your brother's moustache grown again? Not yet. Hello. You are you? Do you have a light, please? - It's upside down. - Thank you. - What are you doing here? - I want to talk to someone. You have a patient in the hospital? - No, I'm waiting for someone. - Forget it. Don't worry, it will work out. As the poet says: "It is useless to be sad, because your sadness will not make the world a better place." - Thank you. Goodbye. - God will help you. Forget it. You can not live your whole life with your brother. I was married before. Can we stop taking the bus? I suffocate in there. We can not go on like this. I'm sick of the bus. Tomorrow is Friday. My brother will be home. If I told him that I have no home? He doesn't have either. Poor her, she was dead anyway. I built my life on her death. One more day... You'll say I knew it. That I was a prisoner. Why did I get married to her? What do you want... It's love, no matter if we want it or not. I couldn't foresee the outcome. I just needed someone, somewhere, waiting for me. To have a reason to get out of here. I met her at the bus stop. I saw her every day when I came out. I wanted someone who existed really outside of here, someone who could fill all the emptiness.
