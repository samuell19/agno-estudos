Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad Mother. Tak Gu! Mother! What are you doing? Let's get going. Tak Gu! Tak Gu! Mother! Tak Gu! President Pro Tem. President Pro Tem, wha... President Pro Tem. President Pro Tem! Sir! Follow him! It's dangerous, Tak Gu. Please, please slow down. You could get hurt. Mother, don't worry. There's no way I'm going to lose you this time. No way I'm going to lose you! Tak Gu. No! Please, move! Please! Aish! Mother! Hey! Chase him! - Yes! - Yes! Mother! Ay, what the hell is that? I gotta deal with all sorts, aigoo. Hey! Tractor guy! Back up! I'm telling you to back up, hurry! Catch her! Stop! Hey! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother. Mother! Mother, just wait a little longer. I'm going to you now, so just wait a little bit! Mother! Mother! No. No. Let's stop now! Aish! Tak Gu. Tak Gu. Mother! Tak Gu. Where's my Tak Gu? Here you are. Thanks to you, we got some good exercise tonight. What are you guys doing? Take her. Let go. Let go! Let me go! Don't you hear her telling you to let go?! Move. I can't see my mother's face. If you don't want to die, you better go back, Kim Tak Gu. I said I can't see my mother's face. I said go back, you punk! Tak Gu! Move aside. So I can see my mother's face. I said move! You punk! You bastards. What are you doing? Don't touch my son! You little punk. Stop it! You damned bastards, stop hitting him! - You punk. - Mother. Stop it! You punk. Stop, Tak Gu! Don't come this way. Don't get hit again! Just run away. You guys stop too! - My Tak Gu... - You punk. Don't hit him! What, you little punk? Stop, Tak Gu! Don't come. - You punk! - How much? How much more do I need to be beaten before you move aside? Before I see my mother, there's no way I'm going back. So you decide. Just move aside, or beat me like this until I'm dead. Huh?! Tak Gu. For me, it's been fourteen years! We were separated when I was twelve, and it's been fourteen years! I've wandered, searching and searching. And the mother I've been looking for is right over there! If it were you, could you turn back?! You must have a mother too! What I've gone through, not knowing whether my mother was dead or alive, you must have some idea how a son might feel! You must if you're a son! Tak Gu. Please, move aside. Please let me see my mother's face. Please, move aside, please. Mother. Tak Gu. Is it you, Tak Gu? It's me. Is it really my son? Yes. It's your son, Tak Gu. It really is my son. It is my Tak Gu. All those years, have you been living well? And you've been eating? And not letting your spirit die? I'm proud of you. My baby. My son. I'm proud of you. Mother. Tak Gu. Tak Gu. My baby. Mother. What? Let's go home now, huh? All right, let's go home now. - We're back. - We're back. You've just come? We saw the wedding and then took them to dinner. Mom, why are you still sitting there at this hour? Were you waiting for us? Who's waiting? It was a pretty wedding, Mom. It was quiet, composed, and modest. There weren't any guests present, but Ma Jun and Yu Kyung were both solemn and sincere. Now, they've become truly husband and wife, Mom. Did I ask to hear about it? I've heard enough, so go on up and go to sleep! But I think she really was waiting for us. Don't you think, Unni? Rotten boy. After how I raised you. After I lived all this time with my hopes just on you. You betray me like this? Rotten boy. How do you feel? How do you feel at becoming a daughter-in-law in the Geosung family? I'm tired. I'll wash first. But tell me... and I'm asking because I'm truly curious, what do you like so much about the guy? Is it simply because of your memories of him as your childhood friend? Or do you really love him as a man? Today is our wedding day. Do we really need to talk about this? You hesitated. At the moment you were pledging your vows, you definitely hesitated. Didn't you? There's no need to look so apologetic. Because I'm not going to get angry or pick a fight. Anyway, you and I reached this point because we each had our objectives. Now that I've married you as you wanted, I guess it's my turn now. Right? What do you mean? Listen carefully to what I'm going to say. Because... this is a very interesting secret... I've carried alone since I was twelve. And the story begins with this bracelet. The truth is, you see, I... You may not believe it, but it's all true. What do you think? Interesting, right? You... why would you... We're husband and wife now. Husbands and wives shouldn't have secrets, should they? Get some rest. You said you were tired. My friends have come downstairs. Sleep well. Woo! Congratulations, Ma Jun! Oppa, I thought you got married today. Where's your wife? She was tired, so I told her to sleep. Then are you going to party with us tonight? Yeah. What meaning does it hold? It means that I'm going to marry you. Perhaps it means that it may be the beginning of misery, because of it. And, if knowing that, you will continue on this path with me, I'll take it to the very end. It means something like that. Hello. Tak Gu. Tak Gu. Tak Gu. Wake up now. I've come! This is my mother. Aigoo. Hello. Hello. I'm Yang In Mok. He's the boss at our Pal Bong Bakery. Hello. My Tak Gu has really inconvenienced you. What do you mean, inconvenienced? And this is our Boss's wife. Aigoo, hello. I'm so glad to meet you. I'm very glad as well. - And this is... - Aigoo, how do you do? I'm Heo Gap Soo. Wow, Tak Gu, why didn't you tell us your mother was such a beauty? Aigoo, I'm so glad to meet you. Ah, am I overdoing it? I don't see Jae Bok sunbae. Mmm. Early the other morning, we got a sudden call from the country. His mother is quite old and she's been ill, so he suddenly had to go down. Aigoo. I hope she gets better soon. Yes, really, she must. Anyhow, I'm so thankful to your family. You took in and embraced my Tak Gu who had nowhere to go. As a mother, I can't say anything but thank you. Ay, no, rather we've been getting a lot of help from Tak Gu. He's just like family now. Thank you. This is your room? Yes. Lie down for a bit, Mom. Come on. From now on, don't worry about a thing and stay here. I'm only going to be at the Geosung family home until the President wakes. After he's conscious again, I'll come right back. And I'll keep coming down to see you until then. Okay? Still, is it right to do this? We should have some consideration. If I trouble them like this... They're family, after all. If you're really uncomfortable, just stay here until I leave the family home. When I come back, we can get our own place. When did my son grow so big? You've really become a full adult now. All that precious time, how can I get it back? It seems that time has only touched me. You look the same as you did back then. You know how to joke like that? I'm not joking. You really haven't changed at all. Thank you. Thank you for growing up so well, and for living as such a good person, thank you so much. Mother. My baby. Tak Gu. Tak Gu, come and have breakfast. Hey In Mok, the pot's really hot. - Danger, danger... - Aigoo, aigoo. - Aigoo, it's hot. - Aigoo! Why are you coming down alone? What about Tak Gu and his mother? I think we're going to have to delay breakfast. What for? And so? Are you saying you ultimately lost her? I didn't lose her. Your men let her go. I'm sorry, Manager. I couldn't block him. I wasn't able to block him. What? He didn't want anything else but to meet his mother. I couldn't block him or beat him any longer. Look here. Who are you betraying after I took you on and let you come this far? Huh?! We may just be lowly thugs who only know how to throw fists, and we may carry out dirty deeds as easily as we eat our meals, but we're human enough to feel the bond between parent and child. What?! So, are you saying you don't want to work for me anymore? I'm sorry. We've been much obliged to you. That... From now on, if you have a task for me, let me do it on my own. Rather than work with a group, I prefer to work alone. Then... Are you positive the guy who attacked you was Jo Jin Gu? Yes. Without a doubt. I see. So that's what happened. For now, until you find the document I told you about, be particularly careful. Manager Han is naturally very suspicious. Remember, this is all for Tak Gu. For that boy to be able to clearly lead Geosung, there's no choice but for me to set everything straight. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes. I understand, President. Mom, is that you? Father! Father! Be quiet. Go shut the door. Now. What's happened? When did you wake up? Don't tell your mother. Excuse me? Not just your mother. Promise me you won't tell anyone. Father. Promise me. Do as I say. Before that, please explain this to me. If you will explain why it is that you're doing this, then I'll keep that promise. What's the reason you're doing this? To find out the truth. Hello. Sit. Is Ma Jun still sleeping? Yes. I heard Ma Jun was looking into an apartment, so I canceled it. Our family will absolutely not set up separate households. Ma Jun is an only son, and living together is a matter of course. I've ordered Ma Jun's room to be redone. So move into the house by tonight. Furthermore, his father is still unconscious. The two of you gleefully living it up in a hotel is grating to see. Got it? I asked you if you got it? Yes, I understand, Mother. I don't accept you as my daughter-in-law yet. If you really want to be recognized as a Geosung family daughter-in-law, start by bearing a son. Then I'll think about changing my mind. Then I'll see you later this evening. Ma Jun, you... I'll be going, Oppa. What brings you here this morning, Mom? No, I guess now that I'm married, should I be calling you Mother? Okay, Mother, what brings you here this morning? What about you, what have you been up to? And who the hell was that girl? No one that means anything. Just a girl I partied with last night. What? Looks like I'll be late for work again. I'm going to have to get to the office. I didn't take any days off for the wedding. Then, I'll see you later, Mother. I'll be back. Mom, you're home? This is it. The room you and and Ma Jun will be living in. So, you ultimately got here. Shin Yu Kyung, you're really something else. Did you want so much to be a daughter-in-law of Geosung? What did you want so badly as a daughter-in-law of Geosung? What is it you think I want? Frankly, you didn't marry Ma Jun because you loved him. There's definitely another reason. Isn't there? I really don't know what it is you want so badly from our family, but since you've come all the way to this point, I hope you find it. Though I don't know if that'll make you happy or not. Are you feeling all right, President Pro Tem? Yes! No problem! When it comes to strength, I'm as strong as steel. Good morning, Manager Han Seung Jae. Thanks to you, I had a really good reunion with my mother, Manager. What are you talking about? This is a request. Let's drop the act that you have no idea what I'm talking about. Don't you have any shame? I really have no idea what you are talking about. You're an adult! I'm asking you, aren't you ashamed living like that as an adult? The thing to really be ashamed of, you see, is having no clue, no right, but relying solely on a father's backing, to sit in a position like that, and behave like the owner. As a long-time friend of the President, I'm warning you, raise your arms and back off at this point, Tak Gu. That way, a lot of people won't get hurt. I'm sorry, but that kind of threat won't move my resolve even one centimeter. I've definitely warned you, Tak Gu. Don't regret it later. Huh? President Pro Tem, are you all right? No, I'm not all right. I'm so angry I could die. But if I let my anger loose, I'm afraid I may become just like that man. So I'm holding myself back. Ah, President Pro Tem. You're here. The Cheongsan factory just called. They say the the goods failed to ship. President Pro Tem! Are you the head of this factory? I'm Kim Tak Gu, responsible for the Cheongsan Factory. I came after hearing a general account of the situation. I'm truly sorry. We will do everything in our power not to let it hurt your business. So... Everything in your power, my foot! Let's go by the provision in the contract. Excuse me? Contract? In the case of undelivered goods, the factory will shall compensate with damages three times the shipment value. That's the provision. Ah, is there a provision like that? What the hell are you? Are you really the head here?! I'm sorry. But still, this is the first time we've failed to ship. How can your sense of humanity... We're reacting like this because this is not the first time. Do you know how many times this has happened?! We don't need to talk about it anymore. Just go by the contract and compensate us three times the value within a month! What in the world has been going on? I told you from the beginning! This factory has no hope! What is all this? These are news stories the PR department has been trying like crazy all day to block. Exactly how bad are the conditions at the factory that the situation has come to this? I'm sorry. It all stems from my negligence. Somehow, I will take care of this situation. What about a plan? Do you have one? No. I don't have a plan. So what exactly are you going to do without a plan in this situation? For now, I'm just going to try. What? I'm going to try to do what I can until I crash. If you're sitting in the President's seat, answer with the responsibility of a President. Do you know how many employees rely on Geosung for their livelihood? If you include the family members they support, it's many more than two or three thousand. All of those people's source of food and shelter are dependent on your plan, and what do you say? You'll just try whatever you can do, with no plan whatsoever? What the hell are you thinking, making such an irresponsible and flippant remark?! Is that something a leader should say?! Then you can teach me. What? You can give me a good scolding like you just did, and teach me how I'm going in the wrong direction. Wouldn't that work? Why should I? Excuse me? I worked from the ground up... for the last five years, to get Father's recognition. But purely because the two of you are sons, Ma Jun becomes the Team Leader of Development overnight, and you are sitting in that seat, in place of Father. With absolutely no effort, purely because you are sons. So why should I teach either of you anything? Because you're worried about Geosung. Just like the President. More than anyone, you're worried about Geosung and its employees. And I'm your younger brother. It's natural for you to admonish me when I'm doing something wrong. Please help me, elder Noonim. Won't you? What is it? What brings you all the way out by the office? A martini for me. You asked me why I liked Tak Gu, didn't you? When I'm with Tak Gu, I feel like I'm a good person. I don't feel awkward when I laugh, and I don't feel embarrassed for being as happy as I want to be. So then, why did you choose me and not Kim Tak Gu? I didn't want Tak Gu to find out... that I wasn't really a good person. Exactly how badly scarred and damaged I really was, I didn't want Tak Gu to see. And, I couldn't shake you off. Every time I saw you, I saw myself. How you don't ever forgive, even knowing you're bringing pain and misery upon yourself. It was so much like me, I felt your pain, and felt sympathy for you. So are you saying you married me out of pity? I don't know what the end is that you're after, but let's go. As we go along, there must be some end. No one knows who'll get hurt, who'll be destroyed in that end, but before we see the end, I really don't think we'll ever be finished. So, let's go. I suppose we'll find out as we go, why you and I, like broken bicycles, couldn't stop. Shin Yu Kyung! It was one moment, but in that brief moment I decided to marry you, I dreamt of happiness with you. Because I had the delusion that perhaps you had true feelings for me. Now I won't ever be deluded again about any such sincerity. Because, Gu Ma Jun, you... truly are a rotten jerk. You've come out, Mother? I see you've come out. I wasn't able to sleep. I guess you're waiting for Tak Gu. Why aren't you sleeping? I wasn't able to sleep either. Were you waiting for Tak Gu, too? That flowering plant is called Yulma* but I called it Yulmo. {\a6}* Gold Crest Wilma in English Next to it is a Scindapsus. It lasts a long time when you cut it and put it in water. - Really? - Mmm. Oh, Tak Gu's here. You've only just arrived? Ta da... What is it? Can't you tell by looking at it? It's a cheesecake. She created it especially just for you. After I saw you today, I knew this cake was just the thing. It'll put you in a good mood. Try it. What's this? It's the typical cheese, and I smell Camembert. Yeah, and on the outside, I made icing using real cream. Here, try it. It's good. Ay, is that all? It's really good. I just don't have much of an apetite today. Why don't you? Is work that hard? Aigoo, what do you mean hard? It's not hard at all. Not a bit! But Fallen Soybeans, your skills have really improved. The cream is much smoother. Oy, couldn't you quit the whole "Fallen Soybeans" thing now? Ajumeoni, because you and I have the same name, he's constantly calling me Fallen Soybeans. I'm so dead tired of it. How can you call such a pretty young lady Fallen Soybeans? That's wrong of you, Tak Gu. Right? See, she's on my side. It's okay, Mom. I only call her that because she is pretty. If she really looked like fallen soybeans, I couldn't call her that. Isn't that so, Fallen Soybeans? Tsk-tsk, you're still calling me Fallen Soybeans. Oho, what is this tsk-tsk? Is that something to say to your orabeoni*? {\a6}* Respectful for Oppa/older brother Ay! Ay! - Ugh. Should I? - Mmm. Have some. - You eat it. - Ah. - You eat some, too. - I will. You eat, too. Don't you wanna eat some? - Then give me just a little. - Have more. Here, try this. Did Ma Jun spend last night out again? Yes. He must be busy. He acted like he would die if he couldn't get married, and just look at the two of you. From what I hear, Mother... this bracelet was apparently yours? That's what he said about this bracelet. That it was yours. Was it fourteen years ago, did he say? Anyway, he said he picked it up in the lower garden. He said it was a very rainy day. By chance, do you remember? Yu Kyung, I mean sister-in-law, what are you saying right now? If you're going to say something, say it so we can understand. What I've said already, I believe that Mother understands. Aren't you eating? Your soup is going to get cold, Mother. I told you, Mother, I didn't want to hurt you. Ma Jun. Grandmother's death. Ma Jun thinks it was because of you. This bracelet was apparently yours? To find out the truth. Father. What I can tell you... ends here. I can't tell you any more, and you can't know any more. Don't look back at what your elders have done, and just worry about you need to do. More than anything, you must look after your younger brother Tak Gu well. This is Gu Ja Kyung. Where is President Pro Tem Kim Tak Gu? I'm sorry, President. Please give us one more chance. We'll never fail to deliver on a shipment again. I'll stake my name on it and take responsibility. Ha, how frustrating. Look here, young President. The real problem is not the missing shipments. Excuse me? That's just the excuse. The most important thing is the taste of the breads. The breads just don't taste like they used to. Do you understand? It wasn't like that when President Gu had a fondness for the Cheongsan factory. President, could I really make this factory... run like it used to? Master, you told me to always believe in myself. But do you think it will really work this time? It's me. What did you want to see me about? Follow me to the study. What's the matter? What is it that's bothering you? That night, the night that Mother passed away... didn't you say that only the two of us knew what happened that night? Why are you asking? I really think that Ma Jun saw something. The boy had my bracelet for the last fourteen years. What? How could that be? I really didn't think it could be true at first. I thought he must have just happened to pick it up in the garden. I thought he was just trying to give me a hard time, but I really don't think that's the case. The night that Mother died, I think our Ma Jun knows about it. That can't be. I searched the area completely. And Ma Jun was a mere twelve years old at the time. There was no reason for him to come down there at that time. And even if he witnessed the situation, there's no way he could have kept it hidden and fooled us so completely. That's not something a twelve-year old child can do. Then how can you explain how Yu Kyung knows about it? Yu Kyung even knows that it was raining that night. Ma Jun told her everything. If there is any chance that our Ma Jun was there, Then what? The night Mother died, if he saw us there, then what do we do? Shin Yu Kyung, where is she now? Upstairs in their room. I must hear it directly for myself. Honey! When my Mother passed away, where were the two of you? H- honey. When my Mother passed away, where were the two of you?! I absolutely... absolutely... cannot forgive the two of you! Absolutely not!
