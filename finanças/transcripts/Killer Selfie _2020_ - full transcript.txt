(bright melodic music) - Why are you doing this? (eerie music) - Once I win this contest, I'll have enough money to buy us a nice wedding. - You don't have to Paul. I love you no matter what. - Babe, it's not like that. My fans, they expect more out of me. Like I'm almost at 3 million followers. - Babe, haven't you made enough? - Money, money doesn't last forever. - It could. - Trust me. - You read the clause, you're way past three times. (bright melodic music) - Don't jinx me. - Maybe you should wait a bit. You look exhausted. - Baby, I got this. I love you. - I love you too. - I'll call you when I'm done. - Hello everyone and thank you for following me. Today, I will be performing my most death-defying stun up today. (eerie music) (bright melodic music) (sobbing bitterly) (screams loudly) (low brooding music) - Detective Brooks. - Yeah. - I think my fiancé was murdered. - Have a seat. - Thank you. I flew all the way here from China. - Woo man, your arms must be tired. - I don't get it. - That was a bad joke. Yeah. So, where are you staying? - I'm staying in a hotel Downtown. - Downtown. All right, just be careful Downtown because there are a lot of crack heads down there. - Can you help me? - Who's your fiancé? Wait a second. Wait a second. Isn't that, that guy that was doing the pull-ups on the side of the building? - Man! God! Man, that guy was stupid. (sobbing) He was the stupidest guy in my life. See pictures of that? His brains was flooded all over the goddamn sidewalk. It's horrible. It's like hit the ground. It's 150 feet like every direction. It's death and destruction blood. It's gonna power wash that guy's blood for like 72 hours. It's good as the street (indistinct). - Jack. - Sorry about that. I didn't mean anything by that. - So what makes you think he was murdered? - #SelfieKiller. - I don't understand show me. - Hashtag S-E-L-F-I-E-K-I-L-L-E-R. This is the last selfie, my fiancé took before he did the stunt. Look what he wrote. If you follow the hashtag, you'll understand. - Hashtag? What the hell is the hashtag? - Hashtag is used on social media, like in your case, it'd be, "Hey it's Jack #Idiot." - Huh? - Exactly. (eerie music) (bright melodic music) (air whooshing) - You're lucky I was right across the street. - This is for Lily, right? - Yes ma'am. - To the Cecil Hotel please. - You got it. (low brooding music) (upbeat melodic music) (air whooshing) - Jesus Max. To get that shirt and some seller, you wanna whomp whomp barn Tijuana? - My mom got me this shirt. - I like it. (sighs) - I think she was taking a selfie. - Hm mh. - He fell down into that dumpster. - You seriously want me to believe that she killed herself while taking a selfie? - That's what happened. - Are you gonna tell Brooks that? - Yeah, I'll tell him. - Good luck. - Oh my God! - I love it. Love it. - I guess, your taken. - Yeah. (chuckles) (horn beeps) - I do need first and last month plus $1,200 for deposit. - It's fine. - I like your hair. - Thanks. - Welcome to Los Angeles. - Thanks. (chuckles) (horn beeps) - You're so lucky, you got this place. (chuckles) - You scared me. - I'm sorry. I've never seen the inside of this. I'm so jealous. Wanna try the apartments? - Not a chance. - I don't blame you. - Wait. - I know you. (horn beeps) You're Kite girl. - That's me, I'm kiting with Kourtney. (laughs) - I still your videos. I follow you on IG. - Really? - Yeah. - What's your name? - Megan Tastic. - Oh then you are cute. - When are you gonna follow me? (chuckles) - So how do you do it? How do you get all those followers? - Wanna take a selfie? - Yeah, let's do it. - We will. (camera shutters) Now, #killerselfie. There you go. - Oh, it's spot on. - Exactly. - Killer selfie with y instead if ie? - Really? If you want money and fame from social media, you #Killerselfy. - That works? - Trust me. You've seen my posts, right? - I mean, yeah, I guess so. - I'll see you around. - Okay. Thanks. (door creaking) (door thuds) - So the girl is coming, right? (hip hop music) He's still on that phone bro? - Look, first of all, how to be a baller, 101. - All right. - So you've seen big brother, right? (chuckles) - Yeah, I've seen big brother. - You really show big brother, 24/7 content. - 24/7 content. - Right. - On the phone. (indistinct) - On the phone. - Got it. - Which in turn, driving our rep. - Make that money. Make that money. - Sounds good to me. - Rule number one, - Ah! - Is that we should never ever be out here doing that alone. You look like goddamn stockers. - Well, that's why I'm with you, to be home. - Big brother. - Well big bro. - Rule number two, - Ah. - you can't just be pushing this car through anybody's hood like that. I think that goes without saying. - That's why you're with me. - Rule number three. - Rule number three. - Hmm. - Selfie, selfie, selfie. - Oh man, what's this? Have you gone crazy? - Yeah, here we cool. (indistinct chatter) - I'm old enough for sleeves. How about that? Look. - Okay dude. (indistinct chatter) - Well, popping in here. (police siren wailing) - Here. - We don't get shot. - No, we rolled and we got to get paid. - What you doing here, we'll keep that rolling bro. - We about to get paid. - You've taken like 10 seconds. Put the phone down. Are you serious? - Relax, relax, relax. We good. - Turn around. - Try and (mumbles) I'm sorry sir. Turn to Chrome bro. - Damn it. - About to get ours. - Good evening gentlemen. Nice night. Full moon. (low brooding music) Nice car. Broken mirror. - That's just his car. (mumbles) - Chill out, relax mother fucker. - With 8 billion people on this earth. How many are watching you? (gunshot blasts) - Hey guys, it's me, Rosey. And today I am doing my daily bit of humanitarianism. I am in DTLA and I'm about to go volunteer at a homeless shelter. You guys, I just wanna talk about like I love helping people because honestly it's like the best thing you could do for somebody. And I don't know about you guys, but like I sleep better at night knowing that like I'm changing the world like one homeless person at a time. Oh my God! Look, there's this homeless guy right here. I mean, he looks so helpless. (sighs) But you know what would make him feel better. A selfie with me. (chuckles) Okay. Let's get down here. One, two, three, philanthropy. One, two, three, philanthropy. (screams) (suspenseful music) - Do you always look through people's windows? - I am so sorry. I was just trying to see if you're home. I brought the check that you were asking about. - Thank you. Just, you could have used the mailbox. - Oh yeah. I'm sorry. I'm new to LA, so I wasn't sure how it worked. - I can only imagine how difficult it would be to be on your own. - Yeah. So I was thinking that... (gunshot blasts) Okay. Kramer. (air blasts) - Why does everyone of those place out to creep me? - Hi. - Hi, I'm sorry. I'm Joe big, quick to scare. - Oh, it's all right. I'm Charlie. - Yeah. I know who you are. I've seen all your movies. - Thank you. I hope just the good ones. - I mean they're all good. Do you live here? I live here. - I own the building. I live uptown in the streets. - Wow! - Are you a model? - I used to, yeah. - You still could be. There's an app you should look into. It's called killer selfie. - Oh, you mean #KillerSelfie? - (indistinct) It's a hashtag selfy killer with a y. - Well Kourtney, she was telling me about it. She even spelled it out. I didn't know Kourtney could spell. (laughs) Have you ever talked with her. - I didn't mean to get her in trouble or anything. - She got in trouble. Like seriously look into the app. Look like you can make a lot of money, quick. Your very pretty. - Thank you. - You should get back into the modeling, and look at anything you were in. (chuckles) - Bye. - Bye. - Hey, you're not gonna believe who I just ran into you. (soft melodic music) (air whooshing) (door thuds) - Good evening. How are you, sir? So, - what are you doing here? - Can you give this to. - Where'd you find us? - It's the phone of the girl who got murdered. - Hear that? - Yes Lieutenant. - So this is the phone of the dead girl we brought in. I'm gonna need you to take off those glasses sir. - Am I under arrest? - No. And the glass has never come off. All I did was bring her phone. - All I need is more information. - Get to work then, don't you? - Yeah, you know that's all we want. So we're asking you're not in trouble and I don't like that. - Why don't you and I go in the other room for a second. All right. - Let me think about it, sir. - Hey Brooks. - Yap. (coughing) - You're so disgusting.(laughs) - You're so disgusting. - Well, I'm thinking about that one for a while. (upbeat melodic music) - So where'd you find the phone? - Look, man, I was sleeping, I woke up the phone was on the ground, beside me. - So then you just decided to pick it up. - Yeah, I could sell it for food. - Yeah, food, right? Like those chips air or maybe something like this? - Can you guys even do this? - We can do whatever the fuck we want. - Can I ask something? - Oh, you got some. - Yeah. - There you go man. (suspenseful music) - Those are fucking assholes. (laughs) We're cops. Looking to make a deal with you, right? - You can have that 40. I got another 40 in bag. I've got more chips in the bag. All you gotta do is tell the truth and all that is yours. And you can walk out of here. - I like your style. (upbeat rock music) - Okay, time to try this up. Hey guys, it's my first time on Killer Selfy. Well, my name is... (door knocks) Come in. I saw you in Killer Selfy. - What? - I was on for a second, (horn blares) like I literally just signed up for the app. - It notifies us when someone nearby goes live. I looked at it and it was you. - It's really creepy. - You won't get over it. - Okay, well I'm confused about like #Selfykiller, Killer Selfy. - Well Killer Selfy, the platform. - Okay. - And #killerselfy is the way to make more money. They will reach out to eventually and make you an ambassador. - How long does that take? - Well, it's not going to take long. You're pretty hot. (phone vibrates) Hold on. - Hello. Oh hi, hold a second, it's my aunty. - Okay, I've got to go, but let me know if you need help with the app. - Okay. Thanks. Hi aunty. Yeah. How are you? - Your mom wanted me to check up on you and see if you're okay. - Really? - Yeah. Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm okay. - What are you doing for money? - I just signed up for this app. - Killer Selfy? - You heard of it? (laughing) - Of course, I use it too. - Did you see me on there? - I sure did. - Well, I would love to get together with you soon. Maybe we can have lunch one day. - Yeah, I'd love to let's do it. - How about next week sometime? - Next week works. Yeah. - Okay, bye. - Bye auntie. - Bye. What the hell? Everyone watching me in this app. (low brooding music) - Looking good Haley. You're prompt, that's nice. - Nice tits, didn't know they were that big. I should have fuck you. God damn, you're stupid though, so stupid. - Hi everybody, it's your girl here on TV. - You just wanna be on TV, don't you? It's all you think about. Just wanna get famous. You just wanna be famous. - Don't you wish that you could have the same enjoyment as a dog going on a walk. - That's not gonna happen for you or anyone like you. - Hey everyone, it's your girl Haley, from Killer Selfy. (indistinct) - Time's up. (screams) - What happened to the dog? (motor rattling) - Come in. - Girl, you didn't even ask who it is before you let someone in. - I had a feeling it was you. - Aah! I see. - Already append. - Oh, what's it you making? - Smoothie. - I love smoothie. Can I try? - Did you see that girl got hit by car, on the app? - What? Really? No. - Check out the last video. - Oh, I should have warned you. - You could have the same enjoyment as a dog going on a walk. - What does that even mean? (tires squealing) - (screams) Oh my... Is this real? - It's all real. - (indistinct) You could have the same enjoyment as a dog going on a walk. - It happened? - I think she just wasn't looking when she was on life. (screams) She'd just cross the streets without checking he cars were coming. - That's bad. - Stupid, if you tell me. - Yeah, exactly. - Hey, have you gone on live again? - No, not since you showed up last time I used it. (horn blares) I hope I didn't scare you. - No, you just kind blew my mind a little more. - Hell no. - Welcome to kiting and with Kourtney. It's a beautiful day and I'm here today with my new kite. Kite, can you take it from here? - Isn't it beautiful? I love it. I also got some new sexy things. (chuckles) Thank you Killer Selfy. Shouldn't have done that. Are you ready to see me fly this kite? - Look at it fly. Hu-hu! (low brooding music) Woo! (laughs) Isn't it beautiful? What I love about kites? When they're out there in the sky, they're free to blow in the wind, just like me. (laughs joyfully) - Can I help you? - What's going on man. - My main man Jack. - Mr. Detective. Don't worry man, we're gonna get you. - You shot shot that crappy tequila and a water bag. Just don't wanna give up. - Tequila? (upbeat rock music) - What are you working on at the moment, the case? - Nah, it's just about this Killer Selfy app. - I see him on that crap in here sometimes. - No shit. - That sounds like a load of trouble. If he tells me I mean, would you wanna network for in your every move? - I don't know, could make you famous. - Yeah, that's kind of famous look at you now. - Yeah. - That's the Chinese girl that talked to Brooks. - Let me see that. - Oh yeah, he's all right? - Yeah. - That's the girl for the innovative video, last week, isn't it? - I don't believe this man. - Maybe you could win a bit on the booze, you might see a bit more clearly man. - Tomorrow. - Yeah, tomorrow never knows. - Lemme get you one more. All for you. - Thanks man. - It's all right. Hey Brooks, have you seen any other videos from this app? Well, you should. - Okay. - All right. I'll see ya. - All right. - Have a good night Max. - You too bro. See you soon. - All right. Thanks max. - Your badge. - When you get your license back, you're driving for a year straight. - Fine. - Still can't believe you got a DUI. (sighs) - Me neither. (laughs) (eerie music) - How's it going Jack? - Lieutenant. - Another phone. - Not just another phone. This phone and the last phone, have something in common. - All right. Is it good? - Put less sugar in it. They were both filmed live on an app called, get this, Killer Selfy, at the time of their deaths. - What! Bagged that girl yesterday just got hit by car. - Did she? - Yeah. Yeah. Read this. - I'll read it. - Really read it. - I'll read it. I'll read it. I promise, I'll read it. I read it tonight, okay, I promise. I'll read it tonight, I promise. - It's still streaming videos on their site. Watch both videos you'll see what I mean. - I'll watch them. - You're are dismissed. - All right. - Take my copy and read it. - Yes sir. (phone vibrates) - What? - Anyway, listen. - What? - Listen, what do you want me to do? - You have a plane ticket, you know what to do? - Do I need an ID? - Do you need ID? It's an airport. Of course you need ID. You have a plane ticket. You know what to do. You get on the plane and you go. - That's fine. - Say it. - Airport ID, plane ticket and just get on a plane and go. - Because you have the ticket. - Yeah, that's fine. - Good. (sighs) - Fucking idiot. - All right. I've been following this app for a while. - Yeah, tell me something new Jack. - I'm trying to find out who owns it because it's local, but I get stopped every time. - Who stops you? - It's more like who doesn't stop me. - Okay. Wait, what do you mean? - Every time I get close, someone higher ups, shut it down. - You know, I saw Lily on there tonight. - Did you watch the video of her fiancé? Watch it. - It's that you. - Why the hell do you think I'm telling you all this? - Because we're cops Jack. - No, it's because you're Lieutenant Brooks, a legend. - You really put the eye in it. - Are you gonna watch these videos? - I will. You know, he lives in LA. - You mean lived? - Look, why don't you take, you and dumb ass and go to his last place of residency. - I'll take care of it in the morning. - I get an IQ of 12. (low brooding music) - All right sir, I know you've seen the videos of this guy doing the pull-ups, right? - Yeah, I watched it last night with your mother. (laughs) - Can you do me a favor and get Brooks to look at him? Cause he has looked at any video I've sent. I don't know, I can he email it to him or something, or maybe I don't know, put a star on it. - So you don't know Paul. - Who's Paul? - He lived here before. - Is he okay? - No, he's dead. - Makes sense, why I moved in here so quick. - Did he leave anything behind? - Well I guess, all of this, it must be his cause it was here when I moved in. - When did you move in? - Just a couple of weeks ago. - That's good. - Excuse me. What are you doing? - I'm just looking. - Don't you need a warrant? - Not unless we think you did something wrong, okay? - All right, is there anyone else who knows anything about Paul? - Maybe Roy. - Roy? I think there's a guy who passed in the way in. - Yeah, he was leaving, I was talking to him about fixing something for the apartment but he said I had to wait until they get back. - So he's gone. - I guess so. - Wow! (horn blares) (laughs) That's just perfect. - I mean you can leave him a note. - No, I don't wanna leave a note, but thank you for your time. - Sure. Glad if I help. - Okay. Thanks. (bright upbeat music) - Hey. - Hey. - I'm still taking a selfie. Are you in? - Yes. (gentle rock music) - Well auntie, (laughs) what is your secrets? - You are so sweet. You definitely take after your mom. - Oh, I'm sending this to her. She's gonna love it. - Honey. - Yes, okay. - What are you waiting on? - No, I just got here. (indistinct) - So have you made any money yet, but modeling? - No with that app? - Seriously? - Yeah. I've seen a lot of people around here make a lot of money. Just make sure you #selfykiller. - Why? You didn't think your arm was hit. You've used it. - Yeah, I've used it a few times. - Get out. - What? I can't be cool. - No, you're of course super cool and hip antsy. (sighs) - Of course. - So, just do once. - That's it? - Yeah. And I don't make any money, so - - What? You have to use it three times. - Okay. - Then you'll get an ambassador email. - Oh okay so that makes more sense because the girl in my building just want me to use it and that I make extra cash and I didn't know, so. - Why don't you start recording right now? - Right now? - Yeah, that way you only have to use it one more time before you start getting paid. - I love you auntie. I love you too, niece. - Okay, are you ready? - Hmm. ♪ It's out to take break to get the trail (indistinct) ♪ - Hey everyone. It's Megan Tastic. I am here with my auntie. - Charlie. - Hi.

How did you know that? - I'm on the app? I just like to know what's going on and I like a little extra money. So, that sound good for me. Well, don't worry about her Charlie. She's still getting used to the LA lifestyle. - No way, everybody makes money but nobody has a job and just keep sucking on mommy's titty waiting for those checks. - Pretty much. - Are you still recording? - Yeah I am. - Record us all.

But nurse, when you're done, I could use one too. - Why aren't you cute? - Damn straight. - Are you okay? Oh man, don't throw up on me man. It's bad enough, I just lost my leg. Now this asshole is gonna throw up on me. I swear, I'll Sue. - I'm fine. I just gotta use the bathroom. - All right. - Can use the one down the hall please. - This is good. - So, what happened? SAS performing. Oh man, that's disgusting. - Sorry. - Don't worry about him. Tell me what happened. - I was performing at the show and next thing I know, I'm lying on the ground, and my leg cut off. - That's all you remember? - Yeah. - You don't remember anything else? That's all you got. (sighs) Were you doing anything different? - I was filming for this app called Killer Selfy. - Killer Selfy? The app that pays you? - That's the one. - Okay. Did they know you were performing? - Yeah, they, they helped me prearrange the show. - All right? That's interesting. - Why? - No reason. (sighs) - Wow! - Man, can you shut the door please? - You can go shut it yourself. - Man, I only have one leg. - I see you got another one right there. - Asshole. - Hey, consider this motivation. - Oh, it's disgusting. (indistinct chatter) (low brooding music) - All my people on Killer Selfy, what's up? It's going down. Yeah, I mean it was mostly, you know, I had an accident on my last show. I had my leg cut off by some fool in the audience. (low brooding music) (sighs) - You hear from my (indistinct). (eerie music) (breaths heavily) - Brooks. - Jack. - You have to see this. - Did you see this? - Yeah, I saw that a few days ago. - Why didn't you tell me? - I had to check some things out first. - All right. What'd you find out? - Besides you're ugly. (laughs) - Can you be serious for a second? - Old, pants are too baggy. (laughs) - Yeah. - All right, Max and I got to check out this video, wants you to watch it after. All right. Lieutenant. - You might wanna switch the (mumbles) there, Jack. - Okay, three, two, one. (door bell rings) Right on schedule. - Hey Corey. What happened to you? - I had a little accident. - Corey, let me see that. It's not little. You want me to stop recording? Please? (door knock) - Come in. (low brooding music) - And here you are. I've been looking for you. We need to talk. - Is it about me recording? - No, it's not. It's a personal matter of about last month's rent check. - I'll get right back. - Shall I go with you? - Megan. - That won't be necessary. - I'm okay. - I think it's best that you just stay out of this. Come on. - I wonder for accidents on Killer Selfy. - Was that the guy? - I checked this out. - Press play. - Yes sir. - When they're out there in the sky... - Is that working? - It's good. - Blowing in the wind. Just like me. (shouts joyfully) - Watch. - Oh shit! Is that the guy who dropped off the phone? - We had him right here. - And we let him get away? (gentle music) - No, all this stuff, happened after he brought in the phone. - Get out of here. - Look. - Do you know where to get him? - Most likely. - Let's go get his ass. All right. - It's impossible, he's the only killer. - He could be. - Do you really think so? - But right now, he's the only one we can link to the crimes. - Are we gonna get back up at this time? - I don't think that's a good idea. - Why not? - Let's catch him on Killer Selfy. - But that's not protocol. - Go to hell with that shit. - What about Brooks? - What about Brooks? I will take any hint. - I don't think it's a good idea. - We have to man. - No, we don't. - Come on. - No. - Come on. - Nope. Come on. - Nope. - Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. - Fine. - Yes. (low brooding music) - You're not even going to get out of the car. - I don't think this is a good idea we're out here all alone with no backup. - Well, he's getting out of the goddamn car. I'll walk over there and arrest that son of a bitch. - Fine. - Are you happy now? - Action baby. How's this work, are we on? We're live. Hey everybody, this is detective Jack McDaniels and detective Max. Sorry, my partner was left anonymous. (eerie music) I'm about to arrest a selfy killer. Yes, that's right. This could be dangerous. I do ready to shoot at all times. This is that piece of shit, who's responsible for all those deaths. Little does he know, it all ends today. Stop. I'll shoot. - Still recording. I'm going to kill two pigs tonight. This is gonna be fun. (gunshot blasts) - Hey man, just get a Grey Goose, (rock music) just to straight up, is fine. Hey mommy? Yeah just, we'll fly out of van (indistinct) and just go in and deal with it when we get that. (indistinct) sandwich, I just need a plane to cash it up, we're leaving. We leave in 20. - That's cool. (indistinct) - You're making noise. - Thanks man. That's a good one. That's a good one but I don't like it. - There was one- There was a, there was a big scene, I think in the desert and there was a, there was a helicopter and then you were on a horse. - The olden. - The olden, and that's it the old (indistinct) on DVD. - Oh dude. Thank you. - Yeah. - (indistinct) buy in the street for me. - Yeah, pretty much. - I kept that horse bucked me off once so. (indistinct) - Yeah. - I got rid of him right after he did that. - That's close to it. (indistinct) - Yes sir. - Thank you. - I was doing my duty for my country. - Yeah, I'm a pussy. I thought about it once more, the whole idea of it. - Yeah, it's fine, there's nothing brave about war. - Yeah. It seems scary man. - Yeah. Get one to war. Does the storm, six months? - Yeah, I mean I cried once watching apocalypse man, and I think it, last very long in the desert. - Done it rough. - Coming after it was a movie (mumbles) just kind of squeezing my balls from inside. I like to think of it as a movie, but I mean I play a tough guy. Always pretty tough, but when it comes right down to it, I failed. I failed, I need someone else to do it for me. - All right. My balls are (mumbles) squeezed like that. - Yeah, I just lost a friend in LA. - Oh man. Yeah, it's tricky out there man. - Yeah, sure is. - You take it easy though. - All right. What's your name? - Brooks. - Brooks? Charlie. - Greetings, brothers and sisters of Killer Selfy. Namaste, crocodiles and alligators. They don't die of old age. They get weak. They die of starvation. They become prey to other crocodiles and alligators. I've learned to communicate with these beautiful creatures. I know you don't believe me, but today I will prove it to you. Let us pray. (indistinct chatter) - Holy crap, God! - Hi boys. (low brooding music) - It's me Bubbles. I was so tired of all this dirt around me. I have an idea. We should build mountains not valleys. - Someone's in here, use the bathroom later please. Do I know you? How did you get in here? (breaths heavily) I don't know, you need to get out of here. (loud screams) (eerie music) (indistinct chatter) - Today is the day, I'm getting silicone injected in my junk. Throw out the jealous. I know a lot of you are probably thinking but let me tell you what it is. A screw inflation is a temporary body modification, that results from sailing and in some cases air when used to fill the scrotum. - Gilbert. - Yes. - They're ready for you. - Okay. (eerie music) - You must be Gilbert. - I am, I know doctor. - Great. So you ready for your Silicon injections today? - sure I am, but I would like to go over there to that contract I signed earlier today. - This is just clearing this up from any negligence, minor technicalities. Do you mind turning your head and coughing for me. - Sure. (coughs) - Good. Good. (low brooding music) The question really is, who referred you to us? - Killer Selfy. - Oh, that's great. - Yeah, it's a video blog where I do different procedures. It says procedures. I'm getting my scrotum injected with silicone. - Now I see, going balls deep, huh? (indistinct) Nevermind, I'm gonna need you to stand up. - Okay. - Here it goes. Maybe I should get my nurse if she could hold the camera. - That's cool. - Nurse. - Yes doctor. - Can you be so kind and film for him? - With pleasure. - I like the sound of that. This is going to hurt for just a second. Breath with me. (breaths heavily) (loud screams) (hip hop music) - Oh my! So gross. Why don't they just want to do that to themselves? It's grand deal. - Hi. Sorry, I'm away from my phone right now. Could you leave me a message. - Auntie, Why is your phone going straight to voicemail? - I haven't done this in a while. I guess I really needed the money. I mean, I'm really pressing my luck. I swore the last time would be the last time. (gentle music) Why do I have a lot on my mind tonight? (sighs) I mean, I know the more you use this app, the more likely you might die. But like I said, I really need the money. Hello? (door creaking) (door knocks) - Come in Kourt. (hip hop music) Where are you going? - I'm moving? - Oh no, it's done. I have no choice. - Well, you gotta give me your new address. - No, I'm moving out of LA. - But you love it. - Not anymore. (sighs) - Why? - It's not going very well for me. Being 30 in a way is too old. (police siren wailing) - Kinda crazy, age doesn't matter. - It really does. Especially modeling. I mean, you can only be cute for so long. And I mean, you're not cute, so. You're hot. (chuckles) - Thank you. - This car was supposed to be here like five minutes ago. It's been 20 now. - Where you going? - Airport. - Oh great. He's almost here. - Okay, do you mind if I catch a ride to my auntie's? - I don't know. - It's on the way. I give you gas money. - You don't have to pay me. - We should wait outside. - Okay. - Hey, can you drop my friend off at her aunts? Being it'll took 25 minutes. - Sure. - How many aunties are in? - Hey, should we take one more selfie? - Sure. - Thanks. - Okay, sure you don't want any money? - I'm positive. - Well, thanks for the ride. I really hope you're aunt is okay. - Keep in touch. - I will definitely. (laughing) - Kourtney, (low brooding music) going somewhere? I just think. Choose this for once. (breathes heavily) (upbeat rock music) - Hello. Auntie. It's me. Megan. Hello. I dint think anything would happen to my auntie. - So, where was your aunt? - Here's the time. - Call me Brooks. - Yes Brooks. - You know I don't see your resemblance. - She was married to my mom's brother. - Okay. - So, I mean, get this straight. So you showed up at her house? - Yeah. I went to her house cause I was worried about her. I saw her on this video on an app. (sighs) - Killer Selfy. - You know it? Yeah, we've been investigating out for a while. - While? Why? - (indistinct) Do you know how many people have died, because of this app? - What? Are you serious? - It's no joke. - I, yeah, I, I lost my partner from that fucking app. - I'm sorry. - What do you know about the site? - I actually don't know much about it other than you can make money. - Yeah, you can make money on it, but did you read the part about your accidental death is not their fault in really, really fine print? - It doesn't say that. - Look at your phone, read it. It's in really fine print. - I'm sorry. I think, I think my friend Kourtney might be in trouble. She just sent me this. - Who is, who's Kourtney? - She lives in my building, down the hall. - This isn't good. I think your friend might be in trouble. - (sobbing) Help, help somebody help me. I'm in a trunk over Selfy Killer. I never owned a Selfy Killer. Oh no, oh no, don't... (buzzing sound) (eerie music) - I'm gonna track her using her GPS. - Okay. - You know about the GPS? - Yeah, of course. - Kourtney told me about it when she showed me the app. - Okay, well. Here we go. - Now, let's check up on Selfy Killer. (sighs) - What is it? (sighs) - These are pictures of all the deaths. - What? From the app? - Yep. - (sobbing) Oh God! - Gross. - It's my auntie, we have to do something before it's too late for Kourtney. - Okay. I'll find him. We'll have to find this creep. - I'll find him, okay? I just want you to go home, okay? And stay off that fucking app. Please, stay out that app. (gentle music) - Shit, fuck. - (whispers) No, (indistinct), I know who the Selfy Killer is. Oh no. (sobbing) Keep him. Okay. Okay, one more. (upbeat melodic music) - Gonna do something. I thought he told me not to. (sobbing) I'm just gonna keep replying. - Hi. This will be my last post. For those of you, who are not aware of the dangers of this app, I'm gonna tell you, right now. Sorry, Lieutenant Brooks. I know you told me to stay off the app, but I can't not warn people. (eerie music) - Can I check out this, Killer Selfy app again? Hmm, what do we have here? I can't believe this. - Here are all those deaths. - Oh wow! - Right? I mean, is he responsible for all these? - He could be. I think that's what Jack was working on. - That's weird. - I can't believe this. That guy is on both videos. - Hey, wait a second. That's a, there's a Megan's, Megan's profile. - That is Megan's profile. - I mean all these people just don't listen. The fuck is wrong with them? Can someone gave me a ride? - I can give you a ride Lieutenant. - Not you. - What's wrong with me? - Cause I really can't understand you. You watched Jack get killed, and you know what? I don't wanna get killed too. - You're not going to get killed sir. - I'm being serious. - I'm being serious too. - You ready, sir? - Yeah, I'm ready. - So please, stop now. - Hello. (eerie music) Megan. Megan. - Now you're sure she lives around here, right? - Yeah, she lives at the apartment over there. (loud screams) - Come on. Come on. - Megan. - Where's that coming from? I think that's coming from over. - You go around back, I go around front. - (sobbing loudly) Help, Brooks. (laughs) - I'll teach you detective. Take a look. Do you think you're safe? You're as good as dead. Time is running out. If you wanna live, you better do as I say. Detective, if you wanna save this girl, watch Killer Selfy in 30 minutes. (laughs) - Do you have a track? - Almost sir. - Any day now. - Hello detectives. Looking for someone? Light of my life. Don't be scared. This won't hurt. You won't feel the fang. (sobbing loudly) (laughing loudly) - Somebody help me. Help me. (eerie music) - I think I found it sir. - Where? - It's at the old warehouse Downtown? - I know that place. (low brooding music) - Jesus. I guess ugly. Nice mustache but what a waste? Its just like a cartoon. Fuck. Fuck. Life's ugly. (sighs) - (sobbing) Hello. (loud screams) - Detectives, please, no please help me, please. - Detective. - Please help. Please. - Your wild. - Detectives. - Here we go. - Are we being filmed? - Oh yeah. - What does this look like to you? - Why would they be dead? They weren't filmed. Being killed. It never stops. Cops will never understand that. Look at me moment. If people only knew what can happen if they record live. (eerie music) - They just don't care. They just wanna be famous. Look out detectives. We're all on Killer Selfy. I am, the selfy killer. - You know what? Keep your gun on him, all right? - Yes Lieutenant. If he moves, the ball his fucking head off. (laughs) - Take this garbage away. - Yes Lieutenant. We're just getting started. - Who's we? - Don't you understand? (sighs) (sobbing) - Papa, I'm gonna die. - No, you're not gonna die. All right. You're okay? - I'm neither, this is not the first time I'm being tied up in LA. - I'm a little bit traumatized. I'm pretty sure that every time I take a selfie for now I'm gonna have nightmares. But otherwise, I think we'll survive. - Okay. Be sure, you're gonna be okay. (gentle music) You don't need to worry at all. All right. - Hey Lieutenant, - Yap. - thanks. - That's my job. (low brooding music) - Nice. Very good Megan, very good. You're beautiful, ain't you? You're a good actress. (clapping) Bravo. Bravo Megan. (air whooshing) - What's this fucking dog? (dog barks) It's gonna need a home. I thought about keeping it but, it shit on my floor, immediately. So, once you shit on my floor, you're out unless you can clean it up and suck my dick. And then there's a chance, I'll keep you. - Come in. (indistinct) - Is that Haley's dog. - Yeah, I guarantee that dog's a lot happier now, without Haley just dragging it around. Trying to get more likes. - I think you're right. But thank you. I'm gonna name him Little Charlie. - I don't think you have an issue with that. - You'll charge me more rent for Little Charlie. Little Charlie. - Nah, I wouldn't do that. We are great. Really proud of you. You're an asset. Help me out. - And if I'm such an asset, where's my asset? Where's the money? - It's already in your account. - Yeah. Yap, it is. - You know it's amazing how I give you a compliment. I say you're an asset, I opened up. I said something that mattered and you didn't hear it. All you heard was the money you wanted. Want, want, want. That's the world we live in man. No, one's happy. They all just want something else. They don't even know who they are. They want more likes. They want more followers. (gentle music) They even don't even know what love is. It's all about the money. It's all ego. - Don't forget about me. - And me. - Hey, who's this? I'm one of Charlie's girls. - Take a selfie Emma. - I am. - Well, that's the Killer Selfy. (group laughing) - That's the money shot. (gentle music) - He fellow fans, it's be bikini girl again. Today is the 24th day of my hike. I think I have one more day to go, so stay tuned. (upbeat melodic music)
