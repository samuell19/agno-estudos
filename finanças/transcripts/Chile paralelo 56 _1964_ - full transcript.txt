Chile: Paralell 56 Descending over two thousand kilometers south of the african continent Until parallel '56 and traveling to the east one passes two thousand kilometers away from Australia And nine hundred kilometers from New Zeland If one continues over the same latitude crossing the whole Pacific Ocean you reach the southernmost continent on the globe The patrol boat "Lautaro" from the chilean armada navigates through the waters of the Sea of Drake at 56 degrees, south latitude And by port, at the patrol block The lonely cliffs of Cape Horn Behold the last confine of America As a finger stretched to Antartica of over 400 meters high Cape Horn is a mountain of rock eroded an washed by the constant lash of rainstorms Sharp edgest of stone Fall down as vertex of a pyramid and lay on the depths of the sea it's 7 in the morning and rains persistently over the island of Horn With 9 kilometers long, this island is the image of desolation Very few are the navigators who saw the sun shine here Nearly all of them speak us of dark fogs, turbulence of the sea and the relentless lash of the southeast winds A small automatic lighthouse above the southeast peak must be stocked with fuel by the men of Lautaro being impossible to arrive by the south cliffs the ship will navigate until the east shelter once anchored at that point, a boat will sail and will try to land on the west beach of the island It will follow a route by land of over a kilometer and a half at first over coast stones and afterwards climbing hills covered by plants and turbal the first boat will sail with the sole mission of tracking a landing site The rainy weather predicts a difficult working day and no one knows for sure if nature will allow to arrive with the supplies to the peak of the lighthouse minutes later the second boat sails carrying five heavy gallons of acetylene gas The look of these dark and rain wet shores makes you believe they were never inhabited by men Luckily the men on the first boat have managed to land on the ground and tie up a rope on the rocky shores of the beach Without help would be hard to endure the heavy surge and the hangover Over the second boat loaded with gallons the caravan of men marches through the obstacles on the ground The group of sailors starts to realize something suspicious has happened over the sky The ever grey and melancholic landscape has started to gradually change The thick storm clouds have fled north and the grasslands seem to florish to welcome the sun 500 meters after the rocky ground, the best route seems to be by the turbales of the hill In front of the sailors, there's a wall of infinite soil hidden under the tangled roots the fiercesness of the ever wet soil has turned the apparent prairs of Horn intro a tangle of twisted branches A surface of green leaves hides the tangle of branches It's not easy to advance over the turbales A cinclodes seems to absolutely ignore the instinct of men and jumps from moss to moss The family of the mosses shows here the most different forms and colors Soft brown colored velvet rugs or tight helmet like shapes, where separate them from one another proves difficult as if they were tightened by their self preservation instinct It could be said that by these latitudes the paradise of mosses is found Prairs of giant mosses never seen by the far men Spheres of plants so solidly tightened among one another that rain water runs right over their chalises without even damaging their integrity and beauty But not everything is virgin nature at the shores of Horn The hand of men is also found there As if upheld by this rock solid flying buttres, at the peak, the wooden beacon remains standing from where the crags of Cape Horn can be seen to the west Over thick spiked wooden beams, opened to offer the least resistance to the wind the small lighthouse of Cape Horn signals during the night to show the sailors coming from Antartida the safe path to return to the continent They say that over Cape Horn the sun shines only two days a year this was one of them Praise be the creator 80 kilometers north, there's the vast island of Navarino separated of Tierra del Fuego by the Beagle channel The mountains at the center provide protection from the south winds leaving a protected valley on the north shore called, for it's singular looks, "Los dientes de Navarino" You could navigate days and days by the Magellanic channels, without finding a foliage as exuberant and as vertical as the one here These woods were the favorite place of the former owners of this land the Yagan indians Pacific race, dedicated to the hunt of birds and guanacos, and to sea fishing Over to the north the Argentine coast can be seen, in the south of Tierra del Fuego and at the middle, the waters of Beagle channel In August, 1953, Navarino is inhabited by no more than 20 families The chilean armada founded a naval base at this beautiful cove that was since then called Puerto Williams The first enterprise was to build a dock and to make possible the landing of a sawmill This was the first house of Puerto Williams A path had to be made through the woods in order to drag the logs into the shore And after cutting down, leveling grounds and marking paths Men from all over Chile assumed the task of building a city Puerto Williams is today a small, beautiful city the southernmost city in the world, above paralell 55, south latitude This modern religious temple could be considered as a just homage to the Salesian missionaries tireless evangelists, men of cience and educators of Magallanes All these houses look to the port. At the edge, over the hill, the house of the commander of the base And at the back, the powerful radio station At the other side, crossing the cove, another work of great importance: an Aerodrome A plane that has achieved to pass over the mountain chains and the turbulent winds of Tierra del Fuego, constitutes with it's arrival a celebration at Puerto Williams The radio station may be able to bring the latest news from the world, but nothing can replace the intimate contact of a personal letter Facing the threat of forced isolation, sick people had to be taken in consideration And not only thinking of white, comfortable beds, heat and medication, but also all the proper equipment that modern surgery demands in a city of our time These intensly poetic landscapes of Navarino evoke at each step the life of their former owners: the Yagan Today, by Puerto Williams, is possible to dialogue with some of their direct descendants and to listen in their own language the evocations of those early years when they navigated in their fragile wooden and sea lion leather made boats armed with harpoons, several oars, and arrows to hurt the running guanaco and to take down flying birds [speaking Yagan] This is the family of Rosa Balfor, who is too young to remember the boat hunts Do you remember them, Miss Rosa? -No. no, no Just like in any other corner of the world, the face of the children seems to flourish with innocence and tenderness In the eyes of the adolescent, embarrassment and flirtation starts to show In the adults, the kindness, the mistrust, the pain the history of the past In the southernmost city of the world, there's also a school In their lessons, the children hear many things about the big cities of Chile without being capable to imagine the 2.500 kilometers that separate Santiago from Puerto Williams Many of them, for example, María and Érica Balfor, don't even know Punta Arenas capital of Magellan, three days away by sea While they study, their parents work on the the school building extension and rise the structure of a big covered gym, always with the same motto in mind: we must rise up And the children will come back to their homes, where the mothers await with dinner ready Fathers, mothers and sons A reflection of our nations history, in these far lands where common effort has erased the social differences The children of the bosses play with the children of the working men and those of the Yagan as if they were brothers Goodbye, little girls Goodbye, gym and school Goodbye children. May god bless and protect this land of promise After a night navigating towards the west The sun rises over the eternal snows at the south of Tierra del Fuego Even when the glacial period is evidently retreating in this region of the globe for some couple thousand years now these lands remain buried under masses of ice that drift until the edges of the shores rising snowdrifts Many tens of centuries will pass before these devastating ice covers have dissolved completely and given way to life The big island of Tierra del Fuego possess a huge arm reaching west it's the Brecknock Peninsula By it's shores can be witnessed with evidence the passing of a glacier that stripped the peaks of vegetation leaving bare naked rock, while the inferior side starts to coat with foliage The Nothofagus oak shows in it's twisted trunks a long history of battles against it's everlasting enemy; the wind Introducing it's roots on the rock cracks, twisting a hundred times over itself tries to straighten up under the imperative of it's nature, allowing for the daylight to work secretly over the chlorophyll of it's foliage Only when the rain lashes the vertical rock and strip it from Limo, this magellanic bush is thorn and thrown into the sea Behold the desolated beauty of Magellan By the evening, the patrol boat Lautaro advances through one of the few channel entries towards the Strait of Magellan The wide mouth of the strait, opened to all the sea surge coming from the Pacific Ocean usually offers terrible twists to the sailors The pass in front of Cape Tamar is traditionally agitated even in the calm summer days The ships often confront masses of water higher than their docks, so they're buffeted like nut shells After two days of navigating one reaches the northern extreme of the province and rounding the vast and mountainous Wellington island, we arrive to one of the most picturesque landscapes of Magellan Port Eden The land of the last Alacalufe indians An air force's weather station and ten small indian houses make the whole of Port Eden In the middle of an exuberant nature, the indians still preservate some of their primitive small houses As soon as some of them spots a ship they exclaim "ship at sight!" in their own language. when that happens, they dress up with their best clothing and shoes to welcome the visitors There's no sadder show than the one of this dying breed together they don't add up more than 52 individuals. This is how they narrate their unfortunate existence: "All that wich the land has, the rain, rainstorms. we patrol the shore, all that, with hope, patiently, patiently, and sometimes it calms down, and some other times it agitates, and there's nothing you can do when it's agitated We go on like that, chopping wood, working around, some chop wood, some carry water, like that [speaking yagan] Moored to the ship, they observe tirelessly [speaking yagan] They know the sailors possess exquisite foods, so infinitely delicious, such as chocolate how delightful must a candy be for those mouths so used to taste nothing more than seafood? Only the boldest accept the invitation to climb up board They are aware of their stink, with that sharp stench of the sea wolf grease they oil their bodies with Only the boldest accept the invitation to climb up board They are aware of their stink, with that sharp stench of the sea wolf grease they oil their bodies with Ageless women with scarred faces. Pacific men without other notion of time more than their memories and the hope of watching the sun after three months of rain children without crying and without spoiling, sons of any woman that holds them in their arms, never quite knowing who their siblings are Saying goodbye to them is like saying goodbye to a whole race A bit further to the north of Port Eden, almost reaching the limit of the Aysen province one finds the mandatory pass of Angostura Inglesa Nothing more deceitful than these quiet waters, that hide under their surface a harvest of lethal rocks The ship must move forward zigzagging under the most strict control of it's chart position The constant checking of signalling and stocking of over 80 automatic lighthouses in the Magellanic channels becomes a routine work for army men No one can navigate through the channels of the Magellanic north without admiring the conformation of it's small islands Hundreds and thousand of island, some of them as tiny as the garden of a house The oaks and Magellanic trees bend towards the sea as if they were trying to drink from the forbbiden water If the weather allows, they disembark to the shores That way they penetrate into the sweet water cascades and contemplate the giant fern woods that cover the ground If a plain rock shore is discovered, they can jump into the land and before the eyes of sea men a new world will unravel: the world of silence and infinitely slow rhythm of the plants, the leaves, the flowers As a rug that covers the soil, they find lichens, an expression of nature's slowest life rhythm any of them is over one or two thousand years old And in the water, the eternal dance of cochayuyo in the sea garden The face of the sea is not always strained with waves when a snowdrift breaks down and falls onto the sea, the sea becomes seeded with icebergs and there are no words for one of creations most beautiful shows THE END subtitled by malvarez
