-﻿Hey, hey, hey. -Easy, easy. FBI, alright? Stop! FBI! Sir, I’m sorry. The plane has left already. You can’t go through! We have one passenger that just went through. -I’m sorry, sir. -FBI! You can’t go through! We need security! Security right away! We have three people that just went through! Come on. -Eat and run. -Woah! Hold it! FBI! We’re taking your truck! Price? Special Agent Turgenson. Does this asshole look like Vincent Moretti to you, idiots? -Were you with him all the way? -Yeah. Except for the men’s room. Where is he? I’m not fucking around! He’s a key witness against the Barinas Drug Cartel. You got him to turn, then hung him out to dry. We’re giving him protection. Ha! And a stand-up job at that! Too bad the hit last week almost got him killed. -So the system ain’t perfect. -Mine is. Find yourself another dupe. No fucking way. We have spent two years on this one. No wonder we kicked your ass out. Arrest him. Powell? Release him. Now. This is an FBI operation, not NSA. I’m changing that. Let him go. I’m gonna catch up with you. I swear. You okay? Yeah. Be a lot better if I knew why I’m hiding a witness that could put the hurt on Barinas. You are not doing anything, Price. We are. It’s a work-for-hire. Like always. -Need-to-know basis. -That’s bullshit. Moretti was one of our plants. We have larger fish to fry with the cartel. Only those idiots at the Bureau, they always miss the big picture. From now on, Price, remember this, we don’t ask about the private clients you run through our system. Don’t... ...ask about ours. Tastes great, guys. Everything okay? Yeah? Good. -Welcome to The Breezes. -Thank you. -Um, take care of them. -Thank you. This way please. Ladies, gents... -Have a pleasant evening. -Thank you. I can’t believe it. We’re broke and he’s giving away 50-dollar cigars. Uh, 38,000-dollar loss this month for The Breezes. 176,000 dollars for the year and now this. It’s an IRS garnishment for back taxes. It’s been... ...difficult. Difficult? It’s disastrous. Every penny we’re making gets swallowed up by this eatery. Kev, you know we can’t promote the restaurant. It could expose us. I just want some relief for Christ’s sakes. You know the deal with the NSA. They get two freebies a year from us and we get unlimited access to the network. Yeah, and that’s great. Except that all we’ve done this year are the freebies. Forget it. I need a drink. Sorry, we’re closed. Even for your best friend? -Sonny! -Hey! Look at you. Well, undercover suits you well, I see. -Where you been? -Seattle. Seattle’s got rain and the Icarus Group. I know the Bureau doesn’t give a damn about rain. I heard you got Paul Elkert to turn state’s evidence against the syndicate. -Nice work. -Thank you very much. Uh, so how’s biz? Not bad. We’re winning awards. But I got a feeling that’s not why you’re here. Turgenson. He’s pissed about Moretti. I know the judge. I intercepted it for you. I thought I’d give you a heads up. Well... Too bad he can’t take a joke. Hey, look, man. You pulled his pants down in front of a lot of people. He wants payback. Be careful. Alright? -Alright. Thanks. -Alright. Hey, come on. Let me fix you something. Oh no, I’d love to. But I’ve got a Grand Jury waiting for me. Justice never sleeps, man. -Hey. -Hey, Sonny. Anything interesting? Yeah, sure. If you call looking at window washers all day interesting. -What about the periphery? -We got two guys out back. It's all clear. Alright. Here we go. I’m going inside. Yeah, sure. Sonny here yet? -Yeah. He’s inside, sir. -Good. How about getting us inside, too? Or haven’t you guys heard The Cleaner is on our case? I’ve heard and I’m not worried. Of course not. A bullet to his head couldn’t do too much damage. Shut up. Hi. All here? We’ve been detaining them separately for the last five days. Good. We don’t want them comparing testimonies. They friendly? They gonna finger Yoesky? They like the deals and the protection we’re offering. That’s why there are no lawyers here. Good. Let’s do it. We’re gonna start with Paolo Bucci, then Renee Brooks. End with Elkert. Got it? You know anything about a warrant I'm supposed to get on your buddy Price? I have no idea. I’m going for a smoke. Take Bucci and escort him to the Grand Jury room. I gotta go .. Look, genius. Unless you want me to ruin your snappy shoes, I suggest you let me out. What? You wanna hold the toilet paper for me? Uptight pricks. Please place your left hand on the Bible and raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give this court and Jury today in this matter on trial will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. Please be seated. Mr Bucci, let’s begin with the description of your duties with the Icarus Group. Come on! Why don’t you stand there! Do something! Outside! Get outside! There’s a sniper! Who are you? You can’t just kill me like this. No, don’t! No! Help! Help! I saw The Cleaner! Shut up! Shut the fuck up! What’s going on? What’s going on? Shut up! Check in the bathroom! Check in the bathroom if he's there! Dammit! God, would somebody turn off that fucking alarm! -Hey... -I got a court order right here authorizing his release. We cannot guarantee his safety if he’s not in our custody. Are you kidding me? He stays in your custody, he gets killed. Let’s go. Son of a... Shit. Who the hell did this? It’s got The Cleaner written all over it. As in the assassin? As in Sara Lee, you idiot. So tell me, you saw nothing but window washers all day, jerk off? -Yeah. -Well I think you missed something. What are you looking at? Price, we need to talk. Do you know who I am? Yeah. Paul Elkert. Good. Then you know why I’m here. Not really. Do you read the morning's paper? Look... I’m a restauranteur. Come on, Price. You know the situation I’m in. It’s all right there except one thing. The gunman... ...it’s The Cleaner. Right. I’m telling you. I saw him. You saw The Cleaner? Yeah. It was dark. He had a hood on. But it was him, alright. He walked right up to me. Put a gun to my head. And then he frisked me. -What was he after? -I don't know. Yeah, right. He didn’t find it or you wouldn’t be alive now, would you? That’s very perceptive of you, Price. He probably missed it because it's... ...taped under that rug of yours. Now I am impressed. I’m not. What is it? The key to my safety deposit box. The money you stole from Yoesky. So Price, you’re gonna help me or not? Your case is too hot. Icarus wants you bad. FBI, even worse. I’ll pay you. My understanding is you're having some financial troubles. IRS leans. Fed pressure. I can make it all go away. One million dollars. Five million. Five? Plus half the money you stole to a charity of my choice. You’re out of your mind. Then you’re out of luck. Goodbye. Shit. Wait! Price! Okay. It’s gonna take me some time. Forty-eight hours. I could be dead by then. No, you’ll be safe. Mr Price. Will you behave if Ivan and Nicholai let you up? Well, I’m not the one breaking arms here. Do you know who I am? Ed McMahon and the Prize Patrol? I got an idea. Where’s my money? Behind door number one, asshole. It's enough! Can we talk? I don’t know where Elkert put the money. I can’t tell you where he is. We are going to find him. Then we’ll be back. Have a good evening, Mr Price. This’ll piss off the Feebs to no end. I’ll understand if you don’t want in. Aw, screw 'em. We need the moolah anyway. But can I ask you something first? The DC Home for Boys? It’s an orphanage. Yeah, I know that. It’s a lot of money. Hey. We get five. Okay. We’re going deep on this one. Deep? Shit. We’re not even supposed to know where they end up anyway. That’s NSA policy, right? But we do. They don’t know that. True, but this time we won’t. And neither will they. I don’t get it. It’s Icarus and The Cleaner we’re dealing with. So I’m making sure Elkert goes beyond the vanishing point. How? We’ll get to that. Connie... Get your comm lines open to these Providers. Secure lines only. On it. -Kevin, transportation. -Yeah. Minimum 5,000 access points and reservations. All modes. -Everything cancelable in 30 days. -Shit. Tall order. Yeah. That’s why Charlie’s crunching route permutations on Daedalus. Patch me through. Can we get started, please? Alright. We’ll be using a Mersenne Prime algorithm. That makes shadow tracking that much more difficult. Elkert will get a hand-held unit with an encrypted flash memory card. He’ll have more than 150 links along the way. We’ll need all our resources. Call on the least used Providers in the NSA system. Providers who won’t even know what it’s all about, but are looking for a trigger code, a break in the chain, an infiltrator that needs to be disposed of. If there is a match, he gives up a new envelope. He’ll get birth certificates, passports, subscriptions, then on to the next link. I’ve run the Provider list, but there are two noted as unknown. That’s our ace in the hole. Something I’ve been saving for a rainy day. Static drops. Providers who can’t give up information even if they wanted to. If you remove the human element, there can be no betrayal. He must enter the correct code here. Or he dies. If he gets through without mistakes, his trail will forever be erased. He’ll be... ...a ghost. I ought to install a revolving door . You boys got reservations? Shut up. I told you I’d be back to see you real soon. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way. This pillow talk, Sam? -If you think you’re gonna try... -Relax, relax. I’m not gonna interfere. -But I got an interest. -Really. What’s that? Let’s just say Price tricked us, too. Elkert’s so deep, we can’t even track him. Now I want to talk to him. Yeah? Well, I want the skinny on Price and his people. Hey, buddy. Sonny. I tried to warn you, man. Yeah, and now you’re here to offer me a friendly deal. Nah, nothing like that. Though... ...you did put a whole new twist on this Icarus affair. Elkert’s still alive. I might not be though. Jason Price. FBI Academy, '81. Top of his class. Youngest Special Protection Agent in division history. Eight commendations. Including a presidential citation. But was suspended twice for insubordination. What do I look like? An idiot? I know all this shit. Give me the post-bureau stuff. Icarus knows I was a plant. The Cleaner’s been contracted to whack me. Jesus, Sonny. Do I have stupid written on my forehead? Look. Wire-tap on Yoesky’s phone. Conversation took place this morning. With The Cleaner. Find him. And while you’re at it, there’s another haircut I want you to schedule. We already discussed that. His type is usually not a mark. I’ll double the fee. Just do it. We picked him up right after the second suspension. Put his skills to use in East Germany. With NSA funding, he devised the most sophisticated protection system in the world called Daedalus. It was used for hiding Western agents who had been exposed. Never lost a runner. But when the Wall came down, the usefulness of the program came into question so... ...Price made a deal with the NSA and went private. Son of a bitch. What about his people? That information is beyond even my clearance. I don’t know what the hell you want me to do. Yes, you do. You’re FBI, Sonny! I’m not touching this. You would give a scumbag like Elkert a fighting chance. You won’t even help your best friend? -How can you put me in this position? -Because I don’t have a fuckin’ choice! You know how screwed up the FBI is! I mean, hell, your own kid Charlie just hacked the system last month and he emailed the director a list of protected witnesses just to piss him off! The fucking system is a joke! Please. I got nowhere else to turn. So you know where all the guys are he’s stashed? You want to find Elkert or don’t you? Rival agencies sharing a private moment. How touching! What happened to Elkert, Price? What happened to “I don’t ask, you don’t ask”, Frank? That only works one way. Well then, it’s my way. You have a good thing going here, Price. I wouldn’t spoil it. You’ve a lot more to lose. Fuck you. I designed Daedalus. So if you wanna play hardball, remember this, the only losers will be the marks I ran under for you. -Is that a threat? -No. I just think that... ...on a need-to-know basis, there’s some pretty important people who’d rather not be known. He’s free to go. What? We had a deal. -We had an understanding! -I changed my mind. Agency prerogative. This is fucking blackmail! I’m going to the director. You do that. I’d watch my next few steps very carefully. We will be. Do what I told you? Yeah. Utilities on. Bank accounts open. Mail’s running. Gym membership. I even went to the dentist. Yeah. Like you’re staying put. Except I’m somewhere else, right? That’s right. -But where am I gonna be? -Here. Rub off the gold seal. Use your thumb, so you don’t damage the chip. Then pop the card in. Connecticut? Just the first leg of many. How're you gonna know if I make it? I will. I will. See the car in the parking lot? Key’s in the visor. Will I ever see you again? No. Remember Sister Sarah from the boys’ home? She gave me this thing when I was eight years old. She said as long as I wore it, I’d always be taken care of. I want you to have it. Thanks. Good luck, Sonny. Yeah. See ya. Burnt-out car was found in a ravine yesterday by a couple of hikers. Coroner puts the time of death at 52 hours. -Jesus. Are you sure? -Yeah. It threw us at first because there were two sets of IDs. One for a Carl Sands from Connecticut. Then we found Sonny’s FBI badge halfway up the hill. It can’t be. We ran a dental check on some teeth we found. Care to comment on these, golden boy? Fuck you. He was a friend. He’s a dead friend now. You got a lot of explaining to do. And this time, you won’t have the NSA around to cover your ass. Okay, okay. Come on, Jason. Come on. Have a nice day. But... ...we double checked everything. What happened? What went wrong? Well, that’s just it. Nothing could’ve. I’ve done this too many times. The only way The Cleaner could’ve gotten to Sonny is if he was already inside. But how’s that possible? I don't know. But we’re gonna find out. -Yeah. -Kev, we’re reconstructing Sonny’s route. I need all transpo details uploaded to Charlie for processing. I’m on it. Should have the first leg within the hour. What a dump! Let’s go. You sure this is it? Kevin confirmed the point with Charlie. It’s a Provider. Step back. Wait here. Okay, Jason. I got it. The next Provider is in Pittsburgh, 163 Red Maple Street. Good afternoon. What’ll it be? Daedalus. Well, I’ll be... I never thought I’d hear that word. So, um, what do I do? -Show me your Provider kit. -Oh, yeah, that’s right. Check him. -He’s dead, Jason. Let's go. -I know. Let's get outta here. Jason, there’s a break at the fifth point. But you gotta hurry. Thanks, Charlie. What is it? We’ve reconstructed the third and fourth link of Sonny’s path. Those Providers are dead, too. We gotta get to the next one first. You don’t get the rust proofing, you’re gonna be unhappy about the whole thing. Hey, trust me on this. If you get the rust proofing, it’s all gonna work out for you. So yeah? Alright. Personally, I think you’re gonna be very happy. I’m looking for Jerry. Oh, that would be me. Can I help you out? Yeah. Let’s chat about Daedalus. I’m sorry. I don’t understand. The hell you don’t. -So you’re a big talker, Jerry, huh? -No, no! -Are you? -No, no! -Who’d you talk to, Jerry? -No one. -Who? -No one. It was a vo... Fake voice, fake voice! -What did they want? -I don’t know. -You don’t know? -I don't know. They want me to use the flash card. They want me to use the flash card. You know the rules. Why’d you do it? -What’d you give him, Jerry? -Nothing. I gave nothing! -Huh, what? -Nothing. I gave him the address that came up. I thought it was for TV. Sorry. -Anyone else show up? -Later. This guy. I gave him the stuff. That’s it. I swear. I swear. Get me your Provider kit. If I find out you lied, I’ll be back. And it ain’t gonna be for TV. Yeah, Jason, it’s me. Go ahead, Charlie. There’s some good news and there's some bad news. First, the good. Daedalus’ extrapolation couldn’t pinpoint a hole. The codes received were all in order. No penetration. Charlie, he knew Sonny was going there. But don’t tell me he couldn’t have cracked the system. Anything is possible. But Sonny wasn’t supposed to be in Virginia. The code should have directed him to South Dakota where he’d link a... -Wait, wait. South Dakota? -Yeah. Kevin’s checking all the transpo routes, but so far there’s no redirect in the database for Arlington. That doesn’t make sense. -Unless... -Unless what? Sonny... He figured it out. I’ll check the back door. Be careful. Let go of me! Who the hell are you? If you’d get off of me, I’d tell you, you jerk. I thought you were with the FBI or Icarus. Don’t sweet talk me. -What’s your name? -Renee Brooks. I was one of Paul Elkert’s associates at Icarus. The Cleaner tried to kill me at the courthouse, but I got the hell out. How’d you manage that? I was in the bathroom. I heard gunshots, so I climbed through the window as fast as I could. Still doesn’t explain what you’re doing here. Are you always this sympathetic? No wonder you and Elkert got along so well. How'd you know about me and Elkert? He told me he was coming to see you. And that I should, too. Because I got this. What is it? It’s a key. To a safety box in the Caribbean. Worth a hundred million dollars. You expect me to believe that Elkert would hand you a key to money he stole? He trusted me. I took care of his finances at Icarus. Besides, the bank requires two keys. Why would he hand one to you? He didn’t have a choice. He keeps one with him. The other one was in his safe at Icarus. When the FBI raid went down, I grabbed what was inside. And now you’re gonna get it to him? No doubt for a price. Ten percent is my standard safekeeping fee. When did you last talk to him? The day of the hit. I was supposed to come to you after he was safely hidden but... ...you weren’t around. And why should I lead you to Elkert? For the money he owes you. What if I don’t? He’ll contact me anyway. I’ll just have to wait. You don’t really buy that phony story. Of course not. But there’s a link to Elkert there. We need to keep her close in case he does contact her. I don’t see why. The Cleaner is inside. Going after our biggest fish. And that means the FBI has a shot at him. It also means all our people are exposed. I need to put a stop to this before someone else gets hurt. So? I haven’t decided yet. Where’s your car? Got a rental. She your girlfriend? What’s it to you? Just wondering why she doesn’t like me. Like’s got nothing to do with it. It’s trust she’s thin on. I think it’s you who’s lacking. Maybe. But I want the truth. And I don’t think I’m getting it. You okay? That truthful enough for ya? Tell me more about Elkert. What you did for him. I set up shell companies that billed Icarus for services in out-of-the-way places like Africa and the Middle East. Trouble spots. Places no one would go check. It worked for a long time. But then he got... ...reckless. He kept wanting more. Taking bigger risks. Greed? Control. He was consolidating power and assets to challenge Yoesky. What happened? Sonny. He was playing both sides against each other. Setting Icarus up for the FBI. When did Elkert find out? Not until it was too late. Sonny lured Elkert with a billion-dollar weapons buy involving four countries. The Feds were waiting. Elkert was floored. He trusted Sonny like his own. He made everyone look bad. So that’s why Yoesky put the hit out. And The Cleaner? What do you mean? You were on the inside. You must have heard stories. Just a killer. Expensive. Never misses. And no one knows who it is. That’s a stock answer. I was hoping for an idea of who I’m dealing with. I couldn’t tell you who it is. But I’ll tell you this... I think The Cleaner is looking for a way out. What makes you say that? Because it’s what happens when you work for the mob. You do things you don’t really wanna do just so you can believe you’re actually getting somewhere when, in fact, you’re only biding time until you can no longer do what they ask. And then... ...you’re eliminated. Kind of sounds like an excuse. Maybe. But it happens to everyone. Elkert, Sonny, me. It’ll happen to The Cleaner. Do you, um... ...have a restroom? Through there. Thank you. -Hello? -Kev, listen. I need you to call Charlie on a secure line. I want the two of you to gather all statistical data on Sonny’s run. Specifically? Route corridors, phone calls, bank charges, credit card bills, whatever. I’m looking for anything abnormal that’ll confirm my suspicion. Which is? If The Cleaner was on the inside, how come he was a step behind Sonny? Well, he isn’t. He got him. Not where he was supposed to be. That’s what’s not right about this. Something’s fishy. Okay. I’m on it. -What is it? -There’s someone outside. Go ups... Go upstairs! Go! FBI! Everybody freeze! Price, we know you’re in there! We know she’s with ya! Price, we got a warrant! Exit plan. Somebody break a window! They’re gone. I think we’re safe. You don’t really need protection, do you? That was some job you did on that agent. Where'd you learn to fight like that? When you work for Icarus, you'd better be ready. Well, they’re gonna start coming down hard now. -Did Kevin talk to Charlie? -They ran the matrix. There’s something. What? He said you should see it for yourself. Do you mind if I leave her with you? -No way! -No way! Now listen, both of ya, in case you haven’t noticed, we got a big problem here. I need to go and see Charlie and I can’t take either of you. So can we be adults for two seconds here? Thank you. Just take her to the safe house and wait for me there. So... What did you want me to see? While cross checking through some 975 million calls made during Sonny’s run, we came up with a remarkable coincidence. The Provider at every one of Sonny’s stops received a call within an hour of his arrival. -But how could that be? -It can’t. I mean, one of the Providers is Fisherman in Bar Harbor who hadn’t had a call on his secure line for the last two years. And that was a wrong number. Alright. Guess we're gonna bring Elkert in. I thought there was no way to trace him. Think I tell you everything? Well... This is, um... ...interesting. It’s safe. That’s all that matters. So how long you and Price known each other? Long enough. For what? To know when he’s not thinking clearly. You always warm up to everyone this quickly, Connie? It takes a lot more than the damsel-in-distress routine to sell me. Well, lucky for me, it’s him who’s buying. I’ll take the bedroom. Thank you. Good night. Reverse the factor by the 29th Marsenne Prime. Match your beta code. Oh, sending these codes could expose the Providers and their locations. You sure you wanna do this? We got no choice. Continue. Well... I wonder if the runners ever knew they were leaving a DNA trail behind by rubbing off those gold patches. Doesn’t matter now. Yeah. So you found the remote that bombed her car in her purse? Man, that is fucked up. Hey. Sorry. Well, sounds to me she’s after all the money. Yeah. Well then, why keep her around? Well, I need her at arm’s length. And, uh... There’s another possibility. What’s that? She’s not who she says she is. I think we hit a static drop. Let me do it. The static drop coordinates? A back door. Next card’s not coming up. He didn’t use it. He jumped track on his own. That's what he planned all along. Well then, he could be anywhere. Back up to the previous Provider. What did he give Elkert? Plane tickets. Okay. Match that Provider with all tickets ever issued to him. Two hits. Phoenix and Boston. IDs? Nope. But there are two high-probability addresses for those areas. But I can’t tell if they’re Providers or Final Covers. Okay. Call Kevin. -Tell him I’ll pick him up in an hour. -Okay. Well, at least you two didn’t strangle each other. Spare the chitchat. Did you find him? No. But there are two possibilities. In other words, he’s lost. He broke protocol, jumped track. But there’s still a chance if we move. -What do we do? -We split up. Kevin’s already arranged flights. You and him hit Phoenix. We’ll go to Boston. We? Come on. Let's go. How well did you know Sonny? Not real well. In only... ...for about two months. I was the last one brought into the circle by Elkert. And he trusted you? It’s why he trusted me. I had no allegiance to anyone else. How’d Sonny manage to fit in? It wasn’t so hard. He had more mob in him than a lot of made men. Sonny? No way! He may have been FBI, but he loved the high-flying lifestyle the syndicate afforded him. Houses, boats... Personal well-hidden assets in countries the government can’t touch. Nonsense. -I set it up for him. -Okay. I don’t want to hear anymore. How long did you know Sonny? Since we're kids. We were orphans in Social Services together. Grew up in the same streets, same foster homes. Eventually joined the FBI together. So... If you happen to run into The Cleaner during all this, what will you do? I’ll ask him to walk away. Leave my runners alone. And if he doesn’t? I’ll kill him. Or her. -Come on. -What? Why? -We’re being followed. -By who? By someone who doesn't really know what a bottle of Red Bull can do to ya. -Are you okay? -Yeah. Fine. Gimme your hand. Come on. Come on. Big baby. Thanks. Well, you know, one back scrubs the other. Speaking of which, I... ...I think I'm gonna take a shower. Everything okay? Yeah. Why? Well, you’re looking at me like I have nothing on. This is nice. Who’s this from? It used to belong to Sonny. What is it? I need you to wait here. -Why? Where are you going? -If I’m right, to meet Sonny’s killer. -Hello? -Charlie, it’s me. The Boston address is a static drop. Anything from Connie? She’s still in the air. Okay. Call me when she lands. But I think hers is a dead end. What makes you say that? Faith. Jason, it’s me. Sonny? What the hell! Get up! -Let me explain to you, man. -Shut up! Shut up! I knew I was being tracked. Just couldn’t figure out how. What the hell’s going on? I faked my own death. The dental work. I scattered some teeth behind. What the hell is wrong with you? I helped you. I know, man. I fucked up. No shit. Why'd you do it? It’s fuckin’ Turgenson. He’s after the money! He knew about some perks I took from Icarus. He told me he’d nail me if I didn’t do it. Do what? -Penetrate your system. -Why? If you were convinced that The Cleaner whacked me, you’d think The Cleaner was inside and getting close. You’d have no choice but to go back to Elkert. Save him. Then I would fuckin’ follow you and I would deliver him to Turgenson. -You killed those Providers? -No! I didn’t do that! That was Turgenson. He killed them after each pick-up. I had no idea, I swear. I knew something stank about your death. Fuck, man, the pressure is huge. My sources are telling me that The Cleaner’s close. Your sources? Who are they? I mean, who are you really? It’s me, man. -Who’s The Cleaner? -I don't know. Yes, you do! Oh fuck, it’s The Cleaner. He doesn’t give a rat’s ass about you. Those are Yoesky’s thugs. Come on. Get your gun! Make sure you leave no trace of him. Let’s go. Oh, Jesus! -Okay, what now? -Jump. -Jump? Oh, you bastard. -Jump! Room 56. When’d she leave? About an hour ago. Did she make any calls? Seattle. You have reached the mail box of Renee Brooks. Please leave a message after the tone. So what was it? It’s how Elkert or somebody contacted her. Who? Alright. Where do we go from here? You come with me. I’m gonna have a little talk with Elkert. After all that’s gone down, why are you dragging Sonny along? He’s my prime suspect. The way to find Elkert is through a safety deposit box. It has to be registered in his name at a bank. Jeez, we don’t even know which one. And I’m not exactly a specialist in bank systems. Well, I know someone who is. Time to recall another runner, kid. And that’s where we are. I need to put your knowledge of bank systems to use. What are we looking for? A safety deposit box. And its owner, Paul Elkert. -What bank? -That we don’t know. Caribbean somewhere. Shit. That many? Cayman Islands alone have 1,034. Ten thousand banks. That’s ten million accounts. All with passwords. Renee hid assets for you in the Caribbean. So? I’ll bet she used the same bank for Elkert. For control. What was it? Aruba. Banco Finansiero Di Aruba. It’s a hit. But no personal info. Just an e-mail. -Can we use it? -ISP’s out of Canada. We could use the AC program I once wrote. E-mail the account an attached Trojan virus, hack the billing database. But it might easily get traced. You might not be the only one. NSA, FBI, you name it. Anyone might get this info. Don’t worry. Anything happens, I’ll take care of you. Something on your mind? Just wondering what’s gonna happen. My guess would be someone’s gonna die. Alright. What do we do? -We go in. -What kind of fuckin’ plan is that? It’s the only one I got. Let’s go. Okay, I’ll take the back. Look for a way in. Don’t betray me again, Sonny. Elkert, it’s Price! What do you want? I’m here to help you. -Your life’s in danger. -You never should have come here. Stop shooting! It’s me, Renee! Renee! What are you doing here? She’s gonna kill you, Elkert! Shut up, Sonny! Goddammit! Who else you’ve got here? -How about The Cleaner, Elkert? -The Cleaner? -What the fuck you talkin’ about? -Take a pick. Either one. Fuck you! Elkert! Elkert! Kill 'em! Kill 'em all! Sonny? Oh, Jesus. Sonny? Elkert? Stay away from me, Price. Take it easy. I’m here to help you. Bullshit. You led them all straight to me. You called Renee. Why the fuck would I call that bitch? -She had your second key. -I don’t need a second key. That safety deposit box is in my name. You only need a second key if you’re not me. Hold on. The Cleaner’s been after this key for... The Cleaner doesn’t exist, Price! But you said... I just mentioned him so you’d help me. Yoesky invented The Cleaner to scare people shitless. That’s all. Well, how about the courthouse hit? Sonny set that up for me. I made Sonny a rich man. He owed me big time. Yeah, Sonny. Think about it, Price. Who else but a government agency would know the exact time, location, and the layout of a secret Grand Jury hearing? Stop shooting. I can get you out. I’m the last chance you got. I don’t need your help, Price. And fuck you if you’re gonna get any of my money. You... But I trusted you. You expect me to believe she shot Elkert to save you? -That’s right. -Horseshit! I’m gonna tear your story apart. Like you did to my Providers? You, murderer. I don’t know what the hell you’re talkin’ about. -They were innocent. -Nobody’s innocent, Price. Drop it, Turgenson! Drop it! Place him under arrest. You can’t arrest me! I’m FBI! You’re wanted on five counts of murder in the first degree. Get him outta here. I warned you this case could go bad. Why’d the NSA want Elkert dead? You picked up on that. Not so hard considering your panicked reaction when I ran him under. Elkert was too hot. We have certain jurisdictional rights, but we couldn’t seize him from the FBI without raising a red flag. So you had him come to me. We thought we’d track him. Quietly. But we weren’t expecting your static drops. Very clever. So you were working with Icarus all along. The mega arms deal Sonny got involved with. Only the NSA had the interest and resources to set that up. So you were using the syndicate to illegally divert weapons to some dirty little war somewhere. Right? That’s what Elkert had on you. That’s what you didn’t want the FBI to know. You don't have to worry about that now. Icarus is pulled out. Your actions have torpedoed important national operations and objectives. Bullshit. Was she your Cleaner? Does it matter? No. I guess this is one time when there’s no need to know on my part. Well, you, uh... ...take care of yourself, Price. Thank you. And I've arranged with the NSA for a five million wire transfer to each of your accounts. Powell agreed to that? If I shut Daedalus down forever, I did explain to him the potential downside of having a motley crew like you guys running it. -Thanks. -Look after yourself, will ya? Yeah. -Hey. -Hey. -Who’s gonna mother me now? -Oh, I’ll send you monthly e-mails. Yeah, yeah. So, what do we do to get you under? Nothing. This one’s my own doing. The ultimate vanishing act, huh? Yeah. I’ll miss you guys. How can you just disappear on us like this? It’s the only way I can leave it all behind, Con. I guess things never did settle right for us. Everything okay? You? Fine. Free as a bird. So where are we going? If I told you, we wouldn’t be safe.
