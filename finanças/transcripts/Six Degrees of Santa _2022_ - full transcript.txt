♪ No no no ♪ I don't have that many wishes ♪ ♪ I don't even need a tree ♪ Christmastime would be much better ♪ ♪ Having you right next to me Hello, everyone, and welcome to Six Degrees of Santa. It's December first, which means it's time to kick off the third year of our project. Now, if you're new to Six Degrees, I'm here to give you some instructions. First, you want to get one of our special boxes, which has the directions on the front. You can order yours for free using the link below, or if you're in the New York area, you can pick one up at our shop, McNevin Paper Company. Next, you want to pick a gift that's meaningful to you and can be enjoyed for a short period of time. Some people choose books, or a Christmas movie, or a game. For example, a puzzle. Pack it all up in your special Six Degrees box and then begin your search for Santa #2. You can choose a complete stranger, or someone in your orbit. Your neighborhood crossing guard, or the gentleman you always see reading on the bench. Pass it off. Then Santa #2 gets to enjoy the gift for a day or two, then repacks it in this box and gives it to Santa #3. Then Santa #3 hands it off... and so on until it reaches Santa #6, who gets to keep the gift. Thanks, Santa! How'd you know? I love puzzles! The spirit of Six Degrees is to connect to the world. By Santa #6, your gift will have made its way to someone you could never have imagined. The process is anonymous. It's more fun that way! You're just sharing a bit of yourself and leaving the rest up to Christmas magic. Now, if you have any questions or comments, feel free to email me at the address below. Happy gifting and Merry Christmas! What do you think, Director? I think it's our best yet! Well, it's December first, so Six Degrees is live! Hmm! Did you figure out what you're doing for your Six Degrees gift yet? I'm still deciding. Maybe my JingleMice Christmas record? You'll never guess what I found for mine. Whoa! You finally found another copy! Online from a used book store in Wisconsin. At least we'll always have ours from Grandpa. Mm-hmm. Remind me, what's your favourite part again? I think it's when Elfie is in New Mexico and she learns about luminarias and how luminaria means "light." Mm-hmm! Well, that's my favourite part, too. And you're my little luminaria. - Oh! - Oh! Good morning, Harper. Dani. I hope it's okay. I love these for a background. Very wholesome. Christmas whimsical. Ooh, that might be a good hashtag. I'm certainly trying to snag more followers. Especially with my new crafty venture. Oh, that's awesome! Hey, you know I slipped an invite to our small business Christmas party into your mailbox. So, you know, you should come. I'll try, if I'm not swamped. So, wow was your date the other night? Dates. Two different apps, two different boroughs. 5 PM, then 8 PM. They were both... okay. I have to say, online dating doesn't sound exactly magical. It's the only way, Harper. You just let me know when you decide to get out there. I'm happy to do a little free consulting. Good to know, but it's not exactly a priority right now. If you change your mind, I'm here. Take care. Bye, Zoey. Alright, let's get you to school, huh? Good morning, my darling daughter! Oh! You just missed Harold. He dropped off another bundle of Six Degree boxes for you. Ooh! What do you think of the pattern this year? I think it's gorgeous. Oh. And... You were mentioned on Ivy B. Holly, one of my favourite Christmas blogs. "Here I go, embarking on my second year of Six Degrees of Santa, a delightful, if mysterious, gift chain I found online. Check it out!" Isn't that what they call trending? Huh? I know I've said it before, but I really feel like you could go big with this. I don't think that counts as trending, Mom. You know what, I've said it before, small and personal, you know? Almost renegade! That's the whole point. I don't mean big like corporate partner. I'm saying big, like, get some momentum behind it. Find a way to get paid for it. Why? Are you firing me? No, I like having you around too much. But your skills are being underserved. What? Working with my mom in our family company and getting to spend more time with my daughter? I'd say that counts as fulfilling. I suppose I'm also saying, who knows how much longer this will be around. Do you mean that in the philosophical sense or... Mom, are you worried? Your father was... better at the business side of things. December just started. It's our busiest time. We just need a banner sale season. We'll be okay. Okay. So, what do we need for a big banner sale season? A rush of Christmas spirit! Luck. Oh, before you settle in, can you walk these packages over to Gus? Please! - Sure, Mom. - Thank you! Mm-hmm! Alright, let's hear it, people, let's hear it. Hi, everyone. Thank you so much for coming. Lovely to see you all. Now, I am beyond thrilled to bring my tech brand into the real world and into your living rooms on Christmas morning with... SparkLTree! Partnering with farmers, we have engineered what we believe to be the perfect Christmas tree. From branch distribution, shape, and needle retention, right down to that magnificent conifer scent. Now, it comes in three sizes, but most importantly, it can be delivered to your front door with the very simple click of a button. Are you ready? - Hey, Hal. - Hey. What's all this? Oh, it's a Christmas tree you order online. Apparently it's perfect. Ugh! Jason Sparks. Of course he thinks he can invade and commodify Christmas. Oh, I'd suppose you've known him from your Silicon Valley days. Yeah, I worked for him. Well, I mean, for one of his companies. I... I didn't know him. He's more of a looming presence. Now just think, no more laborious trips to the farm, having to strap your tree to the roof of your car, scratching the paint. And if you live in the City, imagine not having to haul your cumbersome Christmas trees seven city blocks, only to have it poke you and give you splinters, sap all over your hands, needles everywhere. You gotta love how he pretends like he's doing it for our well-being. Eh, he's always been nice to me. You would buy one of those things? Yeah! I mean, look at it. It's a good-looking tree! But what about your trip to Watson's Farm with Jeanie and the kids, huh? And hot cocoa in travel mugs? Uh, maybe we could just stay in, watch A Christmas Carol instead? I don't believe it. To be continued! Alright. Have a good one. Right to your front door. Thank you so much. Thank you. Are you going to get a SparkLTree? No. Oh. You don't celebrate Christmas. I'm so sorry, I shouldn't assume. Oh, no, no. I celebrate Christmas. I adore Christmas. But I also adore real Christmas trees. SparkLTrees are real Christmas trees. Also, personally, you know, I enjoy carrying my tree back those seven blocks from the tree lot. You know, a family-owned business, something that is practically disappearing. And if the tree wants to poke me with its needles, well, I welcome it! Sorry, do I know you? Have I done something to offend you? Why bother growing living things at all, right? Why not just skip ahead to, I don't know, a Christmas tree hologram that you can decorate from your tablet? That's... not a bad idea, actually. That would be really good for travel. Hmm... Okay, why are you trying to take the heart and magic out of Christmas? I think you're making a lot of assumptions about this tree. Tell you what, how about I send you one, on the house? You might change your mind. I would send it back. Merry Christmas. Good morning, sir. Quick question for you, Elliott. Yeah, go ahead. Shoot, Boss. Do you think the SparkLTree brand fails to exude magic and heart? Uh, I'd say it piggybacks off the inherent magic and heart of the season? We did have that focus group. So... this is your forwarded mail. I checked for anything time sensitive. I also wasn't sure whether to pass this one along. It looks great. Happy. I suppose it was only a matter of time. Um, look up their registry and send them something nice. Sure. Come in! Hey, you! Hey! Happy December, Harper. Happy December to you too! Dani, your dad's here! And you guys better get moving. Yeah. Hey, I saw Six Degrees posted. Yes! You know, look what I found for my gift this year. - Wow! - Mm-hmm! And... you're going to give it away? Well, yeah. I mean, it's the perfect thing for Six Degrees. You know, nobody knows it, so it's new, but it's also timeless. And, you know, it's about human connection. It basically inspired the whole thing. What's up? Speaking of human connection, I've met somebody. And I really feel like it's going to go somewhere. Her name's Sylvia. And I wanted to introduce her to Dani but I wanted to talk to you first. I trust your timing and judgment. I'm happy for you. How about you? Anything going on in that department? No. Nope, no. I'm, uh... I'm putting all of that on the back burner... Hey, Dad! Hey, look at you! Are we excited for The Nutcracker? So excited! See, I wonder if he'll beat the Mouse King this year. Dad! He always does. Come on, let's go. Dear Santas, this book holds a special place in my heart. I decided to go with the Jingle Mice record. Oh, that's perfect! Do you know how many people are going to be listening to your favourite Christmas music? And, uh, do you have a Santa #2 in mind? There's this new girl in my class. She's really shy. How about you? You know, this year, I think I'm going to be in the moment, go where inspiration takes me! Good morning, Leonard! Good morning, you two! Oh, it's the start of your busy season, huh? Yes, but I love it. It probably sounds kind of cheesy, but this time of year, it feels extra special to be the person who connects the people with the packages. And cards. It makes me feel like a V.I.P. - Mm-hmm! - Very important postman! Huh... Hey, come on, let's read the book. Jump up. Yeah. What are these people doing? Thank you. And this is for you. ♪ Craving to hold your hand ♪ Six degrees of love ♪ Coming from different worlds ♪ Still would feel the same ♪ Six degrees from us This is for Mr. Sparks. He gets to keep it! So, Christmas is fast approaching, but we are pretty much wrapped on SparkLTree. Um... We deployed the updates to the companion app. Music Department has added a few extra playlists. For example, "Music to open presents to." And, of course, there's tree care, wrapping tips, et cetera. So, uh, we should be all good to go for your hiatus. Hiatus... Oh, there was this bake sale sponsorship for a local high school basketball team coming this Saturday night. It's really small scale. I'm not even sure how the request got through. Do you just want me to cancel on that... No. No. That would go against the sincere, down-to-earth vibe we're going for. No, put Fabian on it. You can coordinate remotely. Okay. Are you sure I should be heading to Vermont tomorrow? Enjoy your time with your family. I mean, don't forget to take notes on the authentic family Christmas for SparkLTree 2.0. But you haven't spent Christmas with your family in three years. I feel like it's something you should do, yeah. Uh, is everything okay? I think so. Just that off feeling, you know? Mmm. I'm sure it's your open calendar. You're not used to it. I think it's a good thing. I mean, everyone needs to take time off at some point. And Christmas is as good a time as any to... Reminds me, um, that box over there is an actual present. Yeah, Hal passed it along, said some boy who's a fan wanted to give it to you. Thank you. Dear Santas, this book holds a special place in my heart. My father gave me a copy when I was a child. I miss him so much, especially this time of year. But the very book he gave me always reminds me that there is love and connection to be had everywher. Maybe even right around the corner. I wish all of this for you. Yours, Ms. Santa #1. This very book, it was like a lifeline for me when I was young. My family, they moved constantly and my uncle got this for me to remind me that home didn't necessarily need to be a place. I lost my copy and I've been looking for one ever since. And then it just shows up! And the note on the inside... it feels like it was written by me, or for me. So... are we looking into a publishing venture or... The fact that this found me at a time where I'm taking a break to... process how I'm feeling about my ex getting married. So, are we looking to get back into dating apps? Cancelling your hiatus? This isn't about the company. All I know is... when I read this note in this book, I felt something I haven't felt in years. With all those coincidences lining up, I feel like it would be negligent not to follow the data, to see where this leads. I have to find, to meet... Ms. Santa #1. I just have to say, a few of us have really been rooting for you to get back out there, sir. Okay, it looks like this is the website. It's like a chain letter, but with gifting? It is pretty clever, if underdeveloped. There's gotta be some kind of social media component for all these Santas to meet each other. Uh, I don't see anything. Let's watch this video. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Six Degrees of Santa. It's December first... Wait a second. I've met this woman! Yeah, didn't she used to work for us? Wait, what? I saw that you put in for more boxes. Are you still shipping those out, free of charge? Yeah! You know, I actually mailed one off to Skagway, Alaska the other day. Yeah! That's gotta start adding up, sweetheart. Well, you know, sometimes people choose to spend their money going to Aspen for the holidays, but this is how I choose to spend mind. Plus, you know, it drives foot traffic to the store, so I think it's win-win. Harper McNevin. You used to work for me. Hmm, yeah, have you popped by for a forgotten performance review? Hi, I'm Jason Sparks. Oh, I know! Hi. I'm Pauline, Harper's mother. This is Elliott, my executive assistant. I looked into it. You were one of our most promising programmers. You designed Sugar Share, charming neighborhood sharing app. Yeah, which your VP of Business Development squelched because it didn't have enough profit potential. Yeah, that happens. Why are you here? Uh... and how did you find me? Well, as a matter of fact, I am a Santa #6 in your Six Degrees of Santa chain. Your video indicated I might find you here, and well, I was hoping you could help me locate my original Santa. This is the gift I received. Would you look at that! That's... A book. Yeah, Mom. It's a book that I've never seen before in my life. So why do you have to find this original Santa? Well, it's important to me. This book was a childhood favourite of mine. That, along with the note written on the inside the cover, well, it made me think that we might possibly share a... a connection. You mean like romantically? Possibly. Maybe. Listen, I got a gut-feeling and I simply can't ignore it. Huh... I'm going to go inside. I'm sure that I heard the phone. Well, I can't help you. The spirit of Six Degrees is one of anonymity. Well, speaking of that, I actually have an enticing thing to offer you in return. See, I think Six Degrees has a lot of potential. Not interested. I could help you make it a household name, along the lines of "White Elephant." We could loop in investors, sponsors. And we just got that quick analysis back. It would be an advantageous follow up to SparkLTree. Definitely not interested. That's not what the site's about. Though, I don't recall seeing a copyright. Which means there's nothing to stop us from just taking off with it anyway. Is that a threat? No, I'm just thinking out loud. There's gotta be some way I can convince you to help me find Ms. Santa #1. Wait, which is it that you want? Ms. Santa or Six Degrees? Well, both. I'm just hoping we could make a deal, you know, help each other. If you really want to help people, maybe help some of the small businesses that your industry is destroying. You mean like this one? Sure! Easy-peasy. I'll tell you what. You help me find Ms. Santa #1, I'll help with your foot traffic and marketing. McNevin Paper Company will see unprecedented sales. Well, I mean, what if we can't find Ms. Santa #1? You know, or we do and she's like 99 years old or, you know, loathes your very existence? I mean, do our terms still stand? Sure. I don't think it'll be any of those scenarios. Okay, so to confirm, you help boost McNevin Paper Company sales, and you leave Six Degrees alone. No push for growth from you or any of your companies. This is the weirdest deal I've ever made. Oh, just promise! I promise. It's a deal. Elliott. So you made a deal with him to find you. Correct. Look, I was this whirlwind of confusion! You know, at first, I wanted to protect Six Degrees, but then he mentioned helping the shop, and I was mad I didn't think of it first. Well, you have been known to occasionally miss the forest for the trees. Mmm... For the SparkLTrees. - Option one... - Yeah. You come clean and you tell him that the mystery match is you. Just see where it goes! No! Definitely not. Everything about him goes against everything that I care about. And I feel it would nullify the deal. You know, why work up all of these terms only to turn around and say, "Hey, guess what? It's me! Pay up now!" No, that would never fly. And you know I'm not dating right now. It's quite the pickle. Mm-hmm. No, except, maybe not! You know, these tech guys are always looking for a new project, and then, within 48 hours, they lose interest and move on. So I'm counting on that. No, I'm not interested in buying more followers. That's so cringe. The only thing that concerns me is finding something for him to lose interest in. You could just hire an actor to play Ms. Santa #1. Yeah, maybe someone looking for a little publicity? Ah... You hang out with him once, maybe twice, you know, take some selfies, create some hashtags. It will boost your online presence exponentially. And it doesn't have to be more than one day, maybe two. Unless you want it to be more? Nah, he's not my type. I mean, he's objectively handsome in a "pulling off a turtleneck" sort of way. But no. I won't have to break up with him, will I? Um, no. No. I guarantee that he will lose interest. Not because of you! But because... the tech lizard brain. Look, I know that this lie may be a little dicey. Are you kidding me? With all the hijinks that get bandied about in the online dating world, this is nothing! Well, I prefer to see it as an acceptable white lie that helps multiple small businesses. All you have to do is pretend to be Santa #1. This is your roadmap. You love this book. And I will text you what I wrote in the front cover. Is there a chance that he can discover that it's really you? No, no! Slim. Yeah. But he'd basically have to track back through all of the Santas, and that's the beauty of this plan, because even if he does, Santa #2 was Leonard, our mailman! So, we're covered! Sounds easy enough! What's the next step? Admiring your work? Just thinking ahead to SparkLTree 2.0. Ooh! That sounds Christmas magical. It is magical. Here, this is for you. Is this part of our deal? No, it's just a nice thing to do. Hmm. This is peppermint. I saw on your Swift-Gram that you like the peppermint coffee from the kiosk downstairs. I'm thorough. You seem to have a certain idea of me. But that's okay. The lower your opinion is of me, the more impressive it will be when I become... impressive. Well, this impressive journey will be brief. Good news! I found Ms. Santa #1! Yeah, I was able to track her back through the website and, you know, it's a crazy coincidence, because I actually know her. Yeah! She's my neighbour! Well, maybe not that crazy a coincidence, since, you know, most of the people that use Six Degrees of Santa are people that I know because my website is so underdeveloped, like you said. Her name is Zoey. I will send you her number. And yeah, good luck with that. I'll be in touch about my side of the deal. - Wait! - What? That can't be it. I mean, especially since you know her. You gotta give me some details here. I mean, what does she like? Well, she's public on all her social media platforms, so, you know, figure her out, like you did with the peppermint coffee. Isn't that how we learn about each other these days? But that's not your philosophy. That's okay. You do you. Also, this doesn't seem like a very good deal for me. You just give me a phone number, and then I help rescue your family business? Rise from the ashes? Completely save it? No. Why don't you come with me and we'll scope out the situation a little? Maybe we can even organize one of those quirky run-ins that they do in the movies, you know? - A meet-cute? - Sure. How can you be one of the most successful people in the world and not know what that is? Can't your assistant help you? I gave him time off for the holiday. Fine, yeah. Fine. But you know what? I need to call my mom first. - Sure. - Yeah. - Tell her I say hello. - Mmm, not likely. Oh man... Zoey, hey, okay, bear with me here. We're going to need to add a little theatre. She teaches workout classes, she's some kind of influencer, and she also sells artwork on Craft-Zalea. So she's really into the gig economy, so you'll have lots to talk about. She is quite pretty. Well, that's a win-win! And I also know from her feed that she often comes here for a snack after teaching a Pilates class. So, you know, we just have to keep a lookout and maybe we can stage one of those so-called quirky run-ins. Maybe you can bump into each other, or you both reach for the last pastry at the same time. Maybe the coffee spilling thing? That's usually pretty cute, no? No? No. Definitely not. Do you think I should tell her the whole truth? Like, that I sought her out? Well, uh, it depends. You know what? Maybe the fewer the charades, the better. See, this is what I don't get about Six Degrees of Santa. Here you have an opportunity for a genuine, charade-free connection, and your system literally prevents that. It's not a matchmaking service. You know, I actually had a dream about Six Degrees last night. Sometimes I have these creative problem-solving dreams. Will you please stop dreaming about my website? But it has so much untapped potential. Mmm, not your problem! Oh, no. I need to get a napkin. I will go. You stay here and keep an eye out for Zoey. And you know, please, stop dreaming about my website. Oh! Harper? My neighbour? Is that you? Zoey! - Here, here. - What are you doing here? Use this. No, it's too nice. It's fine, here. Hi. I'm Jason. I'm Zoey. Hi, Zoey. Um... Um... Smells good. So, are you new to... Yeah, just around the corner. I teach dance fitness and yoga. That's where I was. O-M-G! Harper, you will not believe what we just discovered! What did you just discover? Jason and I here are part of the same Six Degrees Chain... that I started with a book called Neighbourhood Elf. Northbound Elf. Right! I'm just shaken up about the bizarreness of this coincidence! We should commemorate this moment. - Yeah. - Oh, sure, yeah. Okay. So, I was thinking about the different variations of this Six Degrees of Santa thing, and so there were four other people in our gift chain. 'I wonder who they were. Well, I know one. Our mailman, Leonard, was Santa #2, so that's something. That is something. That's a great scarf. - Oh, you like it? - Yeah. It's one of mine. I mean, I designed it. I have a store on Craft-Zalea. Oh, yes. Harper mentioned that you were working the gig economy. The shop is called Zo-Brad, 'cause my name is Zoey Bradford but no "E" or "Y". In case you wanted to check it out, or mention it, or hashtag it. Yeah, sure. Yeah, I can get my social media manager on it, and get you a mention or two. Yeah. So... Northbound Elf. It seems like it really meant a lot to you. Totally. Yes. There's this part when Elfie is in Machu Picchu, and I was like... I need to travel more! That's, uh... a worthwhile goal. Cheers. Look, this woman had a great idea! She said, "This year, I gifted a set of cookie cutters and my grandma's cookie recipe. It felt like keeping her love alive and spreading it around. Thank you for making this happen." Do you want to read the next one? Where is Kolkata? What?! It's in India. It's from a young man named Arjun. He's wondering how his gift... a snow globe from St. Louis made it all the way to him, and he wants to start his own chain. Can you get him a box in time? Oh, I don't think so, but... Well, what do you think we should do, business partner? Could he make his own box? Great idea. I'll let him know. I finally fixed the ordering page! Oh, my hero! Oh! You practising for the party tonight? I thought you were representing us in the wrapping competition this year. No, it's your turn. One sec. Oh! So, how did the date go? I thought I did my job. It was just bad enough, kept it believable. I really played up the insincere influencer thing. Zero chemistry. Good. Good, good, good. Yes. Except he scheduled a second date, for tonight! I don't know if he thought it went well, or...? Oh. Well, I mean, did you at least get an online boost? Such a boost! Everything's gone nuts. I have all these orders, so now I'm, like, overbooked. I don't know what to do about this second date. Do I go and act horribly? Chew with my mouth open? Let me... see what I can do on my end. Okay. Um, wrapping paper malfunction. Good morning, you two! Here you go. - Hi! Oh, thanks! - You're welcome. Please, feel free to browse. We have a friends and family discount. So, how did the date go? The date was... not great. Oh! Well, I'm sorry to hear that. But I've already gone ahead and scheduled a second date. You know, at first I was a little irked that it seemed like she was just using me to boost her social media presence. But then I thought, why be offended by her being a savvy business woman? When I brought up Northbound Elf, yeah, her response was a little flip, but why should I expect her to open up right away? On command, you know? That's actually a very mature way of looking at things. But didn't you have one of those popular Life-Talks? You know, about sunken costs and minimizing wasted time? I mean, if the first date did not work, why not move on? That's what I used to do, just move on to the next thing. But if this connection felt different, then shouldn't I approach it differently? I don't know, I... I just don't want you to get hurt. Oh, no way! Roller skates? Do you sell these? No, those are mine. And no, we do not sell them. Okay, quick Six Degrees question for you. Why stop at number six? Well, that's the saying, isn't it? "Six degrees of separation." You know, and the box won't last forever. And aren't you supposed to be one of the busiest people in the world? I mean, how do you have time to, you know, hang out and critique my hobby? Oh, well, I am on hiatus. Yeah, I'm taking a break from work for the first time in years. Oh! Now it all makes sense. You're not looking for love. You are looking for a new project! And maybe that's something that I can help you with. You know, we can spitball some ideas, huh? I mean, why don't we revisit the Christmas tree hologram that I pitched you in the elevator? Yeah? Or, um... I mean, what is the SparkLTree of Valentine's Day? How about we discuss the sales makeover I had planned for this place? Sure, yeah. Talk to me. Where do we start? Done. I just dropped you the SparkLTree companion app. There's a new feature on the McNevin Paper Company. I filed it under gift wrapping ideas. I thought that was the perfect home for it. I just, I thought we were working on this together. You know, I have to admit, this is... it's not bad. But this seems very generous. Oh, it's Zoey. She just cancelled our date tonight. You know what? Maybe the significance of all of this is that your heart is open. You know? So why don't you try online dating, huh? That's a project! Oh, can you believe Haley just cancelled? You're going to have to find somebody else to compete against. Well, unless Jason could do it. Uh, I do have the night free now. Can we really invite Jason Sparks to a small business Christmas party for local businesses? Yeah, that is a pickle. Oh, heck. Let's just put him in a disguise! Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas! - Hey, Mom! - Hey, honey! Ooh! Who is this? Oh! Why, I'm Santa, of course. This is Jason, he is a... a work colleague? This is my daughter, Dani. Hi, Dani. It's very nice to meet you. Now, tell me, how were my Santa belly laughs? And be honest, on a scale of one to ten? Uh, maybe five. Geez, tough crowd. Well, I appreciate your honesty. Maybe I'll even hire you on as a Santa consultant. We could use somebody like you around. I hope everyone is enjoying this celebration of Christmas and local small business! As many of you know, we have our traditional gift wrapping tournament, sponsored by the McNevin Paper Company! The McNevin family is being represented by my daughter Harper this year, who will compete against a customary celebrity guest. And this year, our celebrity is Santa Claus! Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! Thank you, young lady. You've been a good girl this year. Oh! Well, competitors will be judged on speed, technique, and creativity! Thank you. You know, I hope you're ready for defeat. I grew up in this industry, so, I was somewhat of a wunderkind and I've only improved from there. You know, I'm not so bad myself. It's all about making shapes and forms, and my visuospatial ability is unparalleled. And go! ♪ It's that time of year ♪ Santa comes to bring that cheer ♪ Your side, please. Oh, it's on. ♪ He's loaded down with candy canes ♪ ♪ I only hope he keeps one open seat, oh yeah ♪ ♪ Come on, Santa, bring those toys ♪ And time! Ooh! Go! ♪ On Christmas Eve ♪ Let's hope the weather's good ♪ ♪ And his elf flight crew finds my neighbourhood ♪ And time! Winner. ♪ This year he's gonna use the door ♪ ♪ I'm begging please keep an open seat, oh yeah ♪ Ha, ha! ♪ All the presents for the girls and boys ♪ What?! Ho-ho-ho, everybody wins on Christmas! There has been a noticeable increase in our online sales for the last few hours. Well, that must be from Jason putting us up on his app. Oh, tech mogul who's actually good at what he does. I didn't know that Zoey was coming. Yeah... I forgot I invited her, otherwise I would have warned Jason. She stood him up today. Wasn't that basically your plan? Uh, yea... yeah... I mean... but it's awkward. I'm beginning to feel guilty. What do you think would happen if I told him? There's only one way to find out. That was really fun. Yes. - One Santa suit. - Ah. And one... sweater. Thank you. - I have to tell you something... - So, I came clean... Oh. - You go. - I just wanted to tell you that Zoey apologized for cancelling our date earlier. So, feeling inspired, I came clean that I sought her out as Miss Santa #1. And I told her that you were kind enough to help me out. Wow. That's... That's great news. It must feel really good to get that off your chest. Yeah. Yeah. She took it surprisingly well. She wasn't even mad at all. You know, like, yes, I wish that we had connected more on our date, but it's just that gut-feeling I got from the book and... I just feel like I have to see it through, you know? You gotta follow that gut-feeling, I guess. Yeah. Uh, so sorry, what were you gonna say earlier? Oh, um, yeah, I wanted to say... thank you. You've been a lot of help today and my mom says that online sales are definitely up. So... Well, you're welcome. You know, I really meant it when I said you had beautiful store. I love this place, so, I'm happy to help. If only we could find out how the present made it halfway across the world. You know how this works: Anonymous Christmas magic. I just wish Arjun in India could talk to a Santa #1 about St. Louis. Or that one dad could send the thank you note about the ukulele that changed his son's life. Finish getting ready, okay? We gotta get you to school. I think I may actually like Jason. Come on in. I mean, I don't... not like him in an epic way. I felt bad about cancelling, so I came to your party to cheer myself up, not knowing he'd be there. Then... I saw him. And then there was something lively. And maybe something sweet about him? Something I missed earlier? I suppose he's had a few surprising moments. Right?! Anyway, I don't know if this is good or bad, cause... you know? The web of lies. No, I think that this is great news. And if it does work out with you two, then... The book did bring you together, just indirectly. And this is a thing we review... down the road? We cannot deny, Jason really helped us. He did. You didn't tell him, did you? I couldn't. I just saw how earnest he is in his pursuit, and... I chickened out. Plus, you know, Zoey says she may actually be into him. So, if I told him the truth, I could ruin things for both of them. So, is that it then? The deal is all done? Well, he helped us out. He left Six Degrees alone and... maybe I didn't connect him to the real Miss Santa #1... - You. - Yes, but I did provide him with a connection. A better one, so... He helped McNevin Paper Company. Maybe when everything slows down, you bring him some of those pastries you brought in. A good old-fashioned thank you, hmm? Yeah. Wow, you are bad at being on hiatus. Come in. Yeah, I um... I don't know where else to go. Really? With all your resources? So, are things back up and running with Zoey? Yes, yes. We are getting dinner tonight, actually. Good. The book that started it all. Ah, Luminarias. You know it means illumination? Did you know the tradition stems from small fires used to guide scouts and spirits home? I did. - Hmm. - You should read it. Borrow it and take it home to Dani. Uh, well, the reason I texted you is I wanted to bring you these as a thank you. Sales are definitely up. Oh, that's great, thank you. What are they? They're kidyos. It's an east Indian Christmas dessert. Dani and I, we have this little project, we read emails we get from Six Degree Santas, and when we get one from somewhere new, we look up their traditions and we make something. And Dani's in charge, so it's usually sweets. Oh, wow, these are really good. Mm-hmm. Okay, okay, fine. Fine, let's take a stab at improving Six Degrees together. What? Really? Wait, are you making a joke? No, it's... Something Dani said made me reconsider and... Well, I suppose you had a few good points... - Mm, yes! - here and there. Are you fist pumping because you're excited about connecting people, or because you think you won an ongoing argument? Can't it be both? Dani, hurry up please! I gotta go! Wow, you put the tree up. Ah, yeah. Uh, thanks for doing this so last minute, I only need half a day, so I can pick up Dani on the way back. Uh, no worries. I think it's cool that you're beefing up Six Degrees. Oh, well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, but maybe. Uh, quick question. You wouldn't happen to be collaborating with this fellow, would you? I've seen that look. I... I can't believe you even follow him. Well, he has good life hacking tips. All I'm saying... is that I'm sensing a new kind of energy from you right now. It's either this new project, or Santa Claus here, or both. Hey, either way, you should let yourself have it. Like I said the day, I'm putting all of that on the back-burner. And either way, it's a non-starter, because he's dating my neighbour. Oh. I think a wall would be a good middle ground for people to post publicly, similarly that they would a product review, do you know what I mean? Like, "Hey, loved the reindeer sock puppet, would Santa #1 like to come forward?" You know? Yeah, but that's where the whole social media element could go wrong, you know? It could lead to competing and outdoing... Is that Zoey? No, it's, um, it's Fabian Lambert, you know, the celebrity chef? I hired him for a bake sale fundraiser for this high school basketball team, no cause too small. No, Zoey is away for the day, she's doing some Business Ladies Who Craft, or something? I don't know. I'm sorry, what were you saying? Yeah, um, right. Um, okay... So what if you're a young girl who gets gifted, um, you know, a hacky sack? And then you look online and then you start to see the... I am so sorry. Let me just finish this up and we can focus, okay? Sure. Hey, what flavour sounds better to you, lavender or cardamom? For a Christmas thing? I'll just tell him to do both. Ooh, how about this? Maple gelatin caviar? That seems kind of seasonal, right? For a bake sale. Why are you getting molecular gastronomy involved in this? It's just what Fabian does. It'll be very high-profile stuff. It's for a high school bake sale. I mean, what is it that you've been going for brand-wise lately? Down to earth and sincere? Uh-huh. I've got a great idea. Get your coat. Trust me, this is going to be great marketing. For this bake sale, Jason Sparks doesn't just throw money at it, no, no, he puts his back into it. He's just like us. Well, that's great, but cooking isn't exactly in my skill set. Hmm. Well, I'm gonna teach you how to make my dad's molasses spice cookies. They're world-famous. And my world famous I mean that they are Dani's favourite, so... You have to wear this. Okay. Thank you. Not bad, not bad. Okay. So with this, you want to stir it seven times clockwise and three times counter-clockwise and repeat it four times. Uh, okay... Hey, wait a second! You guys are pulling my leg, I knew it. Okay, so then you're gonna use spoons... Yeah, put your back into it. That's it. And right next to it? Actually, if you turn this upside down, then right side up, you get more cookies. Oh, clever. Alright. Sweetie, it's time for you to go get ready for your grandma's sleepover. And yes, you can take some cookies with you. Thanks, Mom. Hey, you know what? I think we made some darn good cookies here tonight, let's have it, up top, come on. Alright. Oh yeah, yeah, there we go. It was really nice hanging out with Dani today. Isn't she the best? She is. Thank you. As a matter of fact, I'm thinking of recruiting her as my decorative consultant for SparkLTree 2.0. Well, good luck with that, you know, because she's an artist, so her approach is pure and can't be commercialized. We'll see about that. So, um... is Dani's father in the picture? Yeah, Derrick. Um, actually, he lives in New York City and he's one of the reasons that we moved back here. And you guys get along, you're doing the co-parenting thing? Yeah, we do. And you know, we were just better off as friends and... well, we respect each other, and I... I think that's important. So... what about you? What's your story? Um... Well, uh, I suppose I used to spend a lot of time bouncing from project to project, and with my relationships, I was always weighing the risks versus reward. And often it seemed easier to just move on. But then you begin to realize that something's missing, which is why I had such a strong reaction to Northbound Elf showing up in my life again. You know what's odd? I still don't really feel that Zoey matches the book or the feeling in the note and certainly not the feeling I had when the book showed up on my doorstep. I mean... Listen, I know how silly this sounds, all this over a children's book. No, it's not. It's not silly. Actually, um... I have to tell you something. Um, I know Northbound Elf. Yeah, it was an important part of my childhood too. It inspired Six Degrees a little. I guess what I'm trying to say is, when you talk about how important it is to you, I understand. Why didn't you tell me this? Well, I suppose I didn't see you as an ally at first. I mean, why would I share that part of myself with you? I can understand that. But you know, for somebody who has a lot to say about human connection, you sure do keep a lot about yourself under lockdown. Might be something I have to work on, I guess. So, Mr. Big Tech Entrepreneur who, you know, occasionally burns batches of cookies. Um... what do you say we have a little fun? So, roller-skating, huh? Not ice skating? Isn't that more seasonal? Well, this is indoors, therefore, anytime. You know, I used to skate around this store when I was younger, but then I remembered this place and that you have nighttime access. I see. We can skate through a forest of Christmas trees. SparkLTrees. Yeah, SparkLTrees. We should play some music. SparkLTree comes with a free app featuring such things as tree care instructions and such playlists as "Music to Open Presents to." Ooh. "Dancing around the Christmas Tree." Mm-hmm. "Falling in Love at Christmas." You should save that one for Zoey. Okay. So, I know this is supposed to be a stress-relieving activity, so I promise not to make fun of you if you wobble, as long as you promise not to make fun of my wobbles. Yeah? - Deal. - Deal. I can see why you would make assumptions about me given that I am a techie-numbers guy. - Mm-hmm. - And by numbers guy I mean... number one skater in the entire lobby. Whew. What?! You tricked me. - You underestimated me. - Seems I have. Okay. Okay, what you got then? Yeah? Come on, here we go. There we go. There you go, there you go. Whew! Go on, then. I'll spin around ya. - Yeah? - Whew! Oh! Ah! Are you happy? Happy holidays! We hope you enjoyed this music along with your SparkLTree, and that you sparkle all the way. I wanted your opinion on something as a potential SparkLTree customer. Okay, not even a potential SparkLTree customer, but how can I help? I thought we'd do a little quality control check from this angle. Well, this is how the kids see it. Exactly. I used to love doing this when I was a kid. So, uh, what made you move towards agriculture? What inspired SparkLTree? My uncle. Yeah, we were always very close. In fact, he was the one that gave me Northbound Elf when I was a kid. After my parents passed away when I was in grad school, he became the family that I would spend Christmas with. One year, I visited him on Christmas Eve. And I had been working like crazy, he had hurt his back and he was living alone and didn't have a Christmas tree. It broke my heart. I started thinking, if we can get everything else delivered, then why not a Christmas tree? And not just if you live near a farm, you know? So, I partnered with some farmers who were struggling to stay in business and invited them to participate. Worked out well for everyone. What... So, SparkLTrees actually helps the farmers? Yeah, of course. I needed their skills and they were helped by mine. Wow. Here I was, being such a... brat... about everything. It's fine, I'm used to people jumping to the worst conclusions. You know, the other beautiful thing about SparkLTree? It's extremely profitable as an untapped part of the Christmas market. Oh... You- It's Zoey. Well, that's... that's good. That's a good thing. We should probably call it a night. Okay, regarding Six Degrees, and I know I'm supposed to be on hiatus here. I don't know how to explain it, this feels personal. Fun, I mean... It feels like a field trip. I don't know. Okay, do you want me to have Leon start printing you out the paperwork? Yes, but not the typical paperwork. I'd like to get the copyright process started, fast-tracked out if possible. So, we are looking at a takeover? No. No, no, no. This is just protective. And find a team of coders looking to make some holiday pay. I'll also keep trying to track down copies of Northbound Elf. Is it okay for me to use your handle to really get it out there? Yeah, of course. Although... may have a better angle. Hmm. I couldn't help but notice that your dad's molasses spiced cookies are trending. What? Oh, yeah Jason had this fundraiser emergency, so I convinced him to bake himself. It was fun watching him try to work a rolling pin. Oh, is this part of the deal or a distraction tactic? No, it just sort of happened. I'm letting him help me with Six Degrees. You must really trust him. I do. I just wish he had a reason to trust me back. I wish I'd come clean earlier. Now I'm in this... pickle, as you like to say. It turns out Jason Sparks is a... is a good guy. Earnestly looking for something real. What if he has found it? With the real Miss Santa #1? What if you went ahead and told him? No. If I told him, he'd be mad, and upset. And it would ruin things for everyone. Him, me, and Zoey. And I still have Dani to think of. You know, what if this journey of his is... is just a phase? You know, like I originally thought. Looks like you have thought of all the possible bad outcomes. Which is the sensible thing. No, I think that this is best. It means the least number of people get hurt. Either way, he'll fall so in love with Zoey it won't matter. Or... He'll forget and move on to the next thing. What about your feelings? I'll get past it. I have a lot that's good in life. That your book, Northbound Elf, meant the world to me when I was young, and recently came back into my life in a very... auspicious and unexpected way. I have searched high and low and I am astounded at how hard it is to find a copy, and I recently discovered it's been out of print since the 90s? It wasn't a big seller. Well, let me tell you from experience, the world was missing out. Now, I'm somebody who's fortunate enough to be in a position to bring it back. And it's actually gaining momentum since I posted about it online. Here, have a look at this. You're trending. Do you believe that? Is this something you might consider bringing back to life? This offer's come up before. And from what I understand, republishing isn't fiscally advantageous unless a substantial part of it is digital. And that just doesn't feel right. I was thinking, print only, hard back, for that exact same reason. - I'm trending, am I? - Yes, you are. Gosh, thanks for walking me all this way. You're like a real... gentleman. This is me. Yes, I know. I was here the other night, baking up a storm. Harper helped you with that bake sale? Yeah. And this whole time I thought you came with cooking skills. Guess I usually hire people for that. So, um, I'll see you tomorrow? Christmas Eve? - I'd like that. - Okay. It's you. - Yeah, hi. - Ah. Oh wait, are you Leonard? - I certainly am. - No way, we were just talking about you. That's so crazy. You're like Cupid, you know? You know, part of the Six Degrees of Santa chain that brought us together. Guilty as charged. You know, I figured that out also. You know, I follow you on social media. - Yeah? Oh. - My son works in tech so I gotta stay up on things, you know? I saw the pictures of the two of you and the post about the Northbound Elf. I put two and two together. Santa #2. I'm glad you found each other, but you better treat her right, because she's one of the good ones. And her daughter too. So sweet. Wait, daughter? - Yeah. - Who are you talking about? Uh, Harper and her daughter Dani. Oh, yeah, no. Wrong person. So, uh, Harper started Six Degrees of Santa, but the original Santa in our chain was Zoey. Okay, I hate to quibble, but I'm positive. Yeah, Harper McNevin, Santa #1 in 32A, left Northbound Elf in my car right here. One sec. Hello. Hey. Harper, it's Elliott, Jason Spark's assistant. Yeah, I know who you are. Um, Merry Christmas Eve Eve. Sorry, I'm just a little out of sorts. Uh... I'm calling because... Have you by chance spoken to Jason at all today? To Jason? No, no, we haven't spoken since yesterday. Maybe he's with Zoey. Well, I haven't been able to reach him all evening, which is unusual, so, I just started to worry. Um, if you happen to see him, can you just tell him I have a few important updates on the Six Degrees domain? Also, he'll definitely be able to fast-track securing the copyright, so, no need to worry about... Wait, copyright? From My Six Degrees? That's the one. Unless there's two? No, I never agreed to any of that. I can't believe that Jason... Harper... So, I guess you're just gonna do whatever you want with Six Degrees? What are you talking about? Well, Elliott called me, looking for you, and I guess, well, he let the cat out of the bag. Something about copyright and Six Degrees. Wait, look, I know this may look bad, but it's... No, I just don't know what's worse. If this was part of your plan all along or if you just couldn't help yourself. I thought we made a deal. Did we have a deal? You mean the deal where you help me find Miss Santa ♪1 and then I help you with your shop and leave your site alone? Well, you didn't hold up your end of the deal. So it looks like we're in a grey area. Grey area? No, I connected you to Zoey, I did my part, and I found your... your person. That's not who you found. I know Zoey is not Miss Santa #1. Okay, yeah, um, you're right. I'm sorry. Is there anything else you'd like to confess? Yeah, it's just, the thing is... Um, I thought that you and Zoey... I meant to tell you that it wasn't her. But then it seemed that you guys might be good for each other and... I didn't want to interfere with that. And... you needed me to hold up my end of the deal. Yeah. Yeah. I needed help with the paper company and I wanted you to leave Six Degrees alone. Well, mission accomplished. You don't have to worry about Six Degrees. I think you should go. You know, I know I may not have been on all the up and up. But Zoey's great. And I think you deserve someone great too. Ooh. Ooh. Ah. Another one for the books. What are you so absorbed in? I'm just getting more and more of these emails from Six Degrees people. Like, look! "Thank you for the Christmas magic." "Konichiwa from Six Degrees Kyoto, please tell my Santa ♪1 that their gift changed my life." I'm seeing now that there's such a yearning to connect to each other. Am I limiting the joy of this project? Maybe Jason was right. I thought he was helping you. I wasn't really letting him. We had a big fight. And mostly because I was trying to protect Six Degrees, you know? And for what? It just seems so silly now. Now I've missed out on two great things. I tell you what I won't miss out on... That holiday casserole of yours. Come on, let's get packed up. Okay. And that's how I found out that you were not Santa #1. It feels good to have this weight off my chest. Also, I'm so sorry about taking advantage of your social media. But I gotta say, it's been life-changing. It's no problem, really. And I can keep that up, it's easy. You seem off. Is everything okay? I mean, the past week of lies aside. I know Harper is Miss Santa #1. What?! No way! I know. Now all the weight's off my chest. To be fair, we were all knotted up about it. At some point, we just found ourselves at this point of no return. Mm-hmm. Elliott, what are you doing here? I am so sorry to interrupt. I saw this reservation in your calendar and you haven't been answering the phone so I started to worry but I, uh... suppose I can see why. I wanted to make sure you were alive, and if you were alive, which you are, to tell you that I think I messed things up with Harper. I called her to see if she'd heard from you and I didn't know I wasn't supposed to bring up the copyright. It's quite alright. It doesn't matter anymore. Zoey, this is my executive assistant Elliott. Elliott, this is Zoey. Please, have a seat. Join us. I thought it was the book that was supposed to be a secret. Oh, no, it was supposed to be a secret from her, wasn't it? No, no. Harper. I'm having Northbound Elf republished in hardback for Harper. Wait, it wasn't for Zoey? Uh, no. In the end, Harper deceived me, but it led to you, me and Zoey here on this lovely date right now. But, let's face it, I'm not the person you're supposed to be with. No, no, you are. You're falling in love with her, aren't you? You are falling in love with Harper! You and I meant well, but we have terrible chemistry. And Northbound Elf did nothing for me. Now all the weight's off my chest. I'm... falling in love with Harper. Oh! Harper's fantastic. I've been trying to get her to open herself up to dating for so long. You two would be adorbs. And he's actually double in love with her, first as Miss Santa #1, and now in real life. Great point, Elliott. So, what happens now? Nothing. She doesn't feel the same way. She went to the end of the earth to keep me from finding out... she was the person I was actually looking for. Well, do you think she knows how you feel about her? What about the republication, how did that go over? It hasn't yet, I haven't had ti... I've gotta go. Um, thank you both. Elliott, you stay. Yeah. Dinner's on me. - Uh... - Okay you kids, gotta go. Good luck! Merry Christmas! - Cheers. - Cheers. Hey. Hey. Sylvia's wonderful, Derrick. I'm partial to her myself. How are things going with Santa Claus? It didn't work out. And I think it's for the better. So, uh, I'm to assume that you headed it off. And I guess it's safe to assume that Dani's at least part of your excuse? Because the thing about Dani is... she's growing up. She's getting wiser, more perceptive. Listen, at some point, it will be less about protecting her and more about setting a good example. Hey, remember that big fight we got into in college? And that big gesture that I made, singing to you from your window of our biology class, remember that? Yes. Right. Well, I've been outdone. Santa Claus posted something that I think you might be interested in. Press play. Yeah. I'd say it's less of a business venture and more of a gift to someone very important to me. Because Northbound Elf is very special to her too. It's a book about finding home where you least suspect it. And I found home with her. Oh... I... I've gotta go. Hi. Hey. Is this for Zoey? No, actually, it's for Miss Santa #1. Thought it would remind her of her favourite part of her favourite book. It is. I'm sorry that it's not fully wrapped, I ran out of wrapping paper and my favourite paper store was closed early today. I just saw your post. It was... I was inspired. I need you to know that I was not after Six Degrees. I wanted to secure a copyright but I wanted to do it for you, to protect your idea. And... I also included a prototype. You can think of it as a type of scaffolding. And you can go in there, and play around, and change things if you want. Or nothing at all, it's up to you. But, um... I was just hoping that we could be partners. I... I think you were right about opening up Six Degrees and... I want to do that with you. I thought I was protecting it, but I was actually holding it back from so much potential. I think the same might go for my heart. I'm sorry I didn't tell you that I was Santa #1. At first I thought you were the last person in the world for me, and then that became less and less the case until... you were the only one for me. I think this is another great argument for opening up Six Degrees. I think you might be right about that, partner.
