The Mill of the Virgins (Yellow: The Cousins) - And Valentina? - She's been notified. I don't know if she'll come. Just in time. Here, at least put this on. Even in death he gets to you. Francesco Belardino Gambini Scotteri. 1753 to 1826. Bishop. - And a martyr. - No, he made martyrs of others. It's a family trait. This is Maria, a viscountess, I'm not sure how she ended up here. - A virgin, of course. - Ten children. With that face. My love, it isn't just a woman's face that counts. - And that's my grandfather's father. - You mean your father's grandfather. Aside from a father and grandfather he was also a Garibaldino. Every family in Italy has a grandfather who was a Garibaldino. Come. Let's finish the tour. This is the dining room for the big occasions. - Do you like it? - It makes a perfect morgue. Typical Marta, everything covered, and tidy. She's obsessed with order. I'm curious, is there anything in this house that isn't locked? My dear, handmade in Veneto in the early 1700's, all valuable pieces. And half of this is yours? You really are a little treasure. Do you like it? 17th century ashtray, handy. Pierre, come. - And this is our terrible grandfather. - That bastard? - You're joking, he was a great man. - A great bastard. Alright, he wasn't nice, But he was my grandfather. Admit it, you liked him. Grandfather's bed. It was sacrilege for us girls to come into this room. A profanation. No. Stop. Alright, I'm impatient. I can assure you I won't be staying long. When I've got a tidy pile of cash I know where to go to enjoy it. Don't forget you're in my house. Our house, I'd say. Listen, you know I've paid dearly for this house. I know, it can't have been easy putting up with grandfather. I'll sell you my share for a reasonable price. - We won't argue, you'll see. - What does Pierre think? Does he agree? Agree? Of course. Pierre manages to waste his money, yours, and that of others. He's an expert at it. And you? Aren't you an expert as well? - Very expert. - You never had any dignity. No, I'll leave the dignity all to you. I wouldn't know what to do with it. I just want to enjoy my life and my splendid lover. Why don't you try looking at things more positively. - You might like it. - Really? What do you know about life? You had everything, you've never suffered. - Even grandfather spoiled you. - Right, and so does Pierre. He spoils me so splendidly. He's a marvellous lover. Do you know what love is? - Please stop. - What a fool, of course you do. It happened many years ago. One hot summer's day. A fling with some chap. Remember? What the devil was his name? I told you to change the subject, enough. Yes, I think it was Riccardo. I wonder why grandad didn't take too kindly to him? He wasn't of our heritage, but who cares? He would have been great in bed, don't you think? Or didn't you even have the time to find out? Please, Valentina. We have to live together. Live together? That's impossible with someone like you. You're cold, Marta. You've become an old spinster. Don't fool yourself, nobody could bear to be with you. Nobody. No, dear, nobody. Go away. Go away from here. Look. We used to pretend we were pirates when we were children. - The mill was our ship. - Not bad. Magnificent. Listen, I have an idea, why don't we move in here? - Just the two of us? - It might be interesting. Yes, we could play Tarzan and Jane. Two days and you'll have your dream nest. I prefer Tarzan and Jane. Look who's here. Hello, cousin. I'd be grateful if you moved your car. I'll be right down. You enjoyed that. Listen to her. If I find a door that isn't locked I'll become a monk. Marta won't be able to sleep out of fear someone's going to steal something. Calm down, don't let it get to you. She's looking after my interests as well. What is it, Romolo? They've taken the angel, I saw them. - Which angel? - The angel in the fountain. - Now they're picking my camellias. - They? - Yes, the little one and her husband. - I'll talk to them, don't worry. Don't worry. Anyway, who cares about the angel? But they shouldn't touch my camellias. I'll cut their hands off if they try again. - Don't joke. - I'm not joking. Here they come. - That's enough, get back to work. - I'm going. Sure, I'm going. It's better for everyone. - Who's Romolo upset with? - With you, dear. You shouldn't pick the flowers when they're budding. Nonsense, they're more beautiful. Anyway, they belong to me. Dear, speaking of your things... The notary's coming to read the will tomorrow. Let's hope grandfather didn't leave all the camellias to Romolo. I'm going to have a shower and change, I won't be long. Alright, I'll wait. Pity. - What? - Your legs, you shouldn't hide them. They're very beautiful. Let's try to avoid any misunderstandings. Certain compliments don't interest me, I consider them exquisitely vulgar. I suggest you save them for the type of girls you usually spend time with. Come on, Marta, there's no need to be like that. After all, we're family. It's all happening so quickly. A river of silk. Please.... With the aim of helping my two nieces adhere to these principles... which I have always professed in my life... I declare that the entire Villa Alba estate... be entrusted to my niece, Valentina Poseti Garbini. while the use of the same property be reserved for my niece... Marta Luisa Garbini Scotteri. I'm certain my nieces will be pleased with my decision... that will allow them to live together in a place that's dear to them. Furthermore, I entrust the sum of two million lira to Romolo Turi... to thank him for his services and those of his father and grandfather before him. I've also arranged for my dear Giuditta Simonini... who raised my nieces with such devotion... and took care of me in the final years of my life... be given the use of the property in Sant. Anna... for fifty years from the date of my death. I further bequeath ten million lira to the Holy Virgin of Pisa Church... managed so wisely by the merciful Marcellini sisters. Not wanting such a modest donation to attract publicity... I've arranged for it to be given anonymously. To my dear friend, the notary... who has carefully looked after the family estate for so many years... I leave the Canaletto painting. A 70x42" canvas, with a golden frame... depicting a large canal with gondolas. For his professional work as the curator of my will... he will be paid the sum of five million lira. Now that my property has been divided... all that remains is to remind my nieces of my last wish... The restoration of the chapel in Poggio Alto which was always very dear to me. Signed, Bernardo Garbini Scotteri. Very well, Valentina, from this moment on you're the owner of Villa Alba. A property I can't do anything with because you live in it. Grandfather really played us, but it was to be expected. No, you're wrong, it was the only way to keep the property together. Sorry to interrupt, but there's something I'd like to know. - When will we see any money? - Money? Silver, cash, greens. Will it take long to release the cash from the bank? I'm in a hurry to collect. Right, we're in a hurry. I'll try to speed things up. I'll call you. And now, Marta, I'll need your authorisation for the inventory. If you ask me this is the right place to concentrate. Don't be afraid, there are no ghosts in the family. We're all flesh and bone here. Listen... - Give me a cigarette. - You never buy them. We have five friends for dinner. - Is there anything to drink? - Patience, I'll take care of it. This is Marta, my cousin. The beautiful ice-maiden. Pierre's told me a lot about you. You like music. A piano virtuoso. - Pierre talks too much. - No, Pierre only speaks the truth. Then I also declare that you're a virtuoso on the sitar. And tonight my soul will play only for you. Evidently you don't like the music. - Evidently I don't like your music. - Pity. You'll miss the best part, he plays fantastically when he's drunk. And that's his way to get drunk, he reaches a kind of erotic trance. You'd better go back, don't deprive yourself of this pleasure. - I'd prefer to stay here. - I smell a virgin. Something preciously rare these days. Let go of me. It's always been there, covered in mud. - We called it the drowned angel - I'll try to resuscitate it. - It might be worth the trouble. - That won't be easy. - Well, I'd like to try. - Then you'd better get back to work. Yes, of course, but you see, the door's locked. Take it, that's the key. No, let go of me. Don't worry, dear, these things happen. Go on, continue, it's just a kiss between cousins. Give me those photographs. We don't want any trouble. Don't even think about it. I really want to see if you're photogenic, Marta. Come on, don't waste time. You can have him all day... but don't tire him out because I'd like to use him myself tonight. It's a family of whores. Pig. I've got good taste. Right, a pig with good taste. Not from today. Of course, I knew it. Did you make love to her at least? No, not yet. You're not making a very good impression. - She spent all day in her room. - Perhaps tomorrow will be better. - Count on it. - Certainly. She's never had a man in her life. It won't be hard to get her into bed, darling. Yes, very easy, but I want those photographs. - Pay and you'll have them. - Payment in kind? No, this time it's cash or nothing. I understand. You're a business woman now. Deduct it from my account. What account? An account that goes up every time I go down on you. Rotten pig. You know what? You're a bastard. A dirty bastard. The great penniless artist. You're a pimp, that's what you are. A dirty pimp. I swear you won't get another penny out of me. Worm. Run to Marta, let her pay for you. It's over between us. Go away. Leave this house. It's mine, and don't think you're living off my back like you've done till now. Go away. What are you doing here? Get back. And what are they doing here? Send them away. Yes, I drank a lot and I fell asleep straight away. I didn't even hear her arrive. When I saw Pierre leaving the house, heading towards the mill... I went to her to scold her. She regretted what she'd said. She asked me to drive her to Pierre. I left her just before the crossroads, it isn't far from the mill. In answer, the undersigned replied... "I stopped the car just before the crossroads by the mill." "My cousin thanked me and headed towards the above-mentioned mill." "I can only assume..." "that my cousin, finding the door to the mill closed..." "tried to gain entry through the window..." "but upon reaching the ledge, one of the posts collapsed..." "causing her to fall to her death." Full stop. Is there anything else you remember that you'd like to add? We often played there as children, and it was also dangerous then. Add this as well. "An examination of the planks by the ledge was carried out..." "and in correspondence with the window..." "it appears that one of them was broken recently." "Read and confirmed by the undersigned, Marta Luisa Garbini Scotteri." It was him. What? He killed her. You don't seem drunk. I haven't touched a drop since the other night, but it was him. I don't know how he did it, but he's definitely involved. Luckily, the thought of murder didn't even cross the Inspector's mind. Our family is above certain suspicions. Look at that hypocrite, he managed to commit the perfect murder. Enough, Pierre, no more fooling. Fooling? I'm not fooling at all. It's my fault, I shouldn't have taken her to you. No, you shouldn't have. You know what the French say? Above all, don't be overzealous. Which means, mind your own business. Ever been to Paris? Very bad, you must go. As soon as I've got what's due to me from Valentina's share, I'm going back. I'm not hanging around. - Goodnight. - Wait. The funeral bill. I really don't understand why they gave it to me. - Because you were her husband, perhaps? - Yes, agreed. But I'm not famous, dear, and what's more, I don't have a penny. I know who that top belongs to, and I know what those marks mean. Why did you go back to clean the cistern? I don't know. You wake up and you think; I'm going to do some cleaning today. - That's all. - Listen to me, Romolo. You were born in this house and I imagine you'd like to stay. - Of course. - Then forget everything. And never mention it again, to anyone. The thought of murder didn't even cross the Inspector's mind. Your words, if I'm not mistaken. You could call it the perfect murder. Almost the work of a professional. Only you're not a professional, and murders are never perfect. What are you getting at? I don't like riddles. So you're saying it was murder, but we're above suspicion. I advise you not to say any more. You might be able to convince me you're innocent... but certainly not a judge. A judge wouldn't be so naive, or indulgent, if you prefer. - What are you thinking of doing? - I don't know, yet. Maybe nothing, for the moment. I suggest you abandon your plans to return to Paris. Pay him, and make sure he signs the receipt. - Down here? - Yes, there. - Are you going to the city? - Sure, just to get out. Here. Don't be late. Who are you? A fellow. Where are you? There you are. - A gift for you, they're very sweet. - No, not now. Please. No, I told you I don't want them. Try them, they're delicious. Good morning. Please excuse me, they told me I'd find you here. - Mr. Cheri? - Exactly. - And who are you? - Excuse me, Saccara. Shall we go inside? I don't mean to trouble you... but the Inspector asked me to look into the death of your... - Cousin, I believe? - Yes, my cousin. I'll need a few more details before I can archive the case. I've read Marshal Fiore's report on the events. A tragic death, for a woman so young and so beautiful. I believe your wife was only 23. - Almost 23. - You've got to be strong. I know it's hard but you've got to find the strength within you. You're still so young. And you, madam. And now, if you don't mind, will you help me reconstruct the facts. What facts? How the accident happened. Why do you worry? He said it's simply a formality. It's always trouble when those people are involved. Besides, he might find something. He won't find anything. Not him, or anyone else will find anything. I don't doubt that you were careful, but the others? That old man, for example, the gardener. Romolo? Don't worry, he won't talk. - What are you doing there? - Just looking around. - What are you looking for? - I'm a police detective. An officer of the law. In that case, go right ahead. Do you need it for the irrigation? - Or to fill up the cistern? - Depends. I see it's been cleaned recently. I'll need to ask you a few questions. Where will I find you? I'm always here. You'll find me. He asked about the cistern... and then he asked me a lot more questions. But I kept quiet. Fine, he says... "One of these days I'll pay you a visit." But I think, you're wasting time, my dear commissioner. You won't get a word out of me. - Something new? - No, nothing. Alright, take a couple of sacks. I'll deal with this when I go to the city. Right, in the city. But deal with it properly, it isn't something to take lightly. - Did I frighten you? - Certainly you did, jumping out like that. - I'm sorry. - It doesn't matter. - Were you looking for someone? - Mr. Cheri. We're old friends. - Poor Valentina, what a shame. - Yes, terrible. Did they love each other? Did they get along? Of course, besides it's only natural, two young newly-weds. Apart from that argument they had on the night of the accident. Argument? I didn't hear anything. I understand. What a lovely sculpture. Can I go in? No, it's locked. - Can you open it for me? - You'll have to ask the lady. She keeps all the keys. That blasted policeman is always hanging around. Right. Were you waiting for us? No, I came to ask your handyman a few questions. - Perhaps I can help. - No, unfortunately I need a statement. It's just a formality. I don't understand what problems there could be, the case has been solved. Yes, I'd like to believe it. I confess this investigation seems superfluous to me as well... but there are others who've formulated a strange hypothesis. And what is this hypothesis? Murder, my friend. - I hope you're joking. - I never joke about these things. An order to exhume your wife's body. When will it end? Or rather, how? Everything's going to be fine, you'll see. The commissioner wants to speak to you. I'm sorry, but I need to ask for a bed for the night. There's a problem with my car. Unfortunately the gearbox is broken. I can take you. That's very kind, but you see I'm an emotional sort. It's my nerves, it's different with my driver, he's been with me for many years. But it really wouldn't be possible with anyone else. I know it may seem absurd, but just think, even taxis make me ill. I'll have them prepare a room. Please, there's no need. I'll be fine here. - I could drive you home. - That's very kind of you. - What are you doing? - I'm leaving, right now. Are you insane? It will seem like a confession. - Sorry, what confession? - They've got a lot of proof against you. - Why give them more? - You've got all the proof. You're the one who can send me to jail for life. You're hurting me. I'll do a lot worse. I'll do anything. Anything you want but don't leave me. I've never seen you cry. Promise, Pierre. Promise me. You can't leave me. I like watching you cry like this, it's exciting. Tell me you won't go. Tell me you'll stay. Go on, cry some more. Try to understand me. Cry. I can't trust anyone anymore. Not even you, Marta. Get those things. Now. I'm going to make them disappear, right now. With your permission, madam, I'll take those. Yes, I've finished here. I'll wait. The autopsy confirmed that Valentina was struck on the back of the neck... and then drowned in the stream. The proof is irrefutable, Mr. Cheri. When Miss Garbini accompanied your wife to the mill... You saw her arrive. So you hid at the top of the stairs. You waited for the right moment, then you hit her on the back of the neck. Then you dragged her down. You placed her body next to the stream, with her head in the water. While you were moving your wife's body... your sweater got stained with blood. So you thought you'd dispose of it in the cistern. Along with this hammer. But a few days later the gardener cleaned the cistern again. These are the facts, Mr. Cheri. But we both know perfectly well that couldn't be further from the truth. It know it was my fault, but you shouldn't have humiliated him like that. You must go to him and apologise. Tomorrow will be too late. Come. I'll take you. At that moment she wasn't thinking of blackmailing Mr. Cheri. The idea came later. When the gardener brought her proof of the crime. Mr. Cheri told you he intended to return to Paris. At this point you realised that evidence could seal his fate... and it would have forced him to stay. Isn't that right? I'd never have believed you could interpret the facts with such absurd logic. - Based purely on imagination. - Based on imagination. Let's examine the evidence. If Mr. Cheri wore this sweater it would only have been marked on the front... and it wouldn't have the same marks on the back. And we know this hammer was locked in the greenhouse. And only one person has the keys. You, Miss Garbini. Can you prove it was in the greenhouse? This photo was taken by your cousin in rather unusual circumstances. Just a few hours before her death. This is the photo, and this is a blow-up of a detail. As you can see, it was locked, and the hammer was inside. And that's not all. The rediscovery of your cousin's shoe. The obvious traces of blood left on the ground. And many other details. No, there's too much for us to go on denying the facts. And I won't continue denying them. - My compliments, splendid work. - Thanks, but I can't take the credit. As far as we were concerned the case was closed. The idea that it was an accident seemed perfectly plausible. Then Mr. Cheri asked us to intervene. Yes, and he's been a valuable collaborator... with the information he supplied and the help he's given us. Is it true? It was my duty to defend myself, my dear. I enjoyed sleeping in your bed, but the price was too high. I suppose I'll have to come with you. I'm afraid so. Then I'll get ready. I won't be a moment. Can I offer you something? I usually choose the people I drink with. Rarely have I met an individual as cold and ruthless as you. - You'll have a splendid career. - Thanks for the compliment. I'd like to repay the compliment but you won't have a career. - Really? - You're not cut out for the job. - Why not? - Right now, for example... You're making a big mistake. You shouldn't have left that woman alone. And so it ends. Satisfied, old man? To your health.
