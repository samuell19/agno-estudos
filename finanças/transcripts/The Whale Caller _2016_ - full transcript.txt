[African singing] * [African singing] * [horn blowing] [applause] [horn blowing] [horn blowing] * * * [low chatter] * I'm the woman for you, * * You're the man for me, * * Together baby, * Baby take a chance, She's going to be a big international star. Ah, fuck off, man! Yeah, you're right, my baby. Yeah. I'm gonna be a star. Hey, what's a love... Hey, fuck off, man! [Indistinct cursing] Yeah, no man, no man, I'm not a busman. I'm a Malay. [Laughter] I actually don't even care what you people think, man. Me? I'm gonna be a star. I'm gonna chase my dream until I catch it. The same way you chased that silly whale caller that dances with the whales. [Laughter] [cursing] * You're the man for me, * * I'm the woman for you, * * You're the man, * * Being together baby, * We can be a family... [urinating] * I'm the woman * Oof. [Horn blowing] * I'm the woman for you, * * You're the man for me, * * Together baby, * We can be a family, * Open up your heart, * Baby give us a chance, * Together baby, * We can have a hot romance, * [giggling] Hey! Fuck! Ah, fuck off, man! She's a fucking coward, fuck off! [Horn blowing] [horn blowing] Hey, sexy! I don't even want you anymore. I'm gonna be a star. [Continues blowing horn] Hey, fuck off! Go keep your eyes on your fish! [Muttering] * Did you hear the news on the radio today? * * People have agreed to give their love away, * * I can't wait to be there in line, I don't know... * Angels? * Politicians have agreed to honour- * Where are you? * Think I'm down to listen to what the people say, * * I can't wait to be there in line, * * I don't know... You can come out now, ok? I'm gonna take you home. You know? It's very, very... even for little angels like you. Girls? You know, it's not nice to disrespect your elders, do you hear me? Come now, men. You're hurting my feelings. [Sobbing] I'm sorry. I'm sorry, auntie. We didn't mean to. [Screams] [laughing] What are your names? I'm Sara and she's Sarki No, she's Sara and I'm Sachi. That's what I said, didn't I? No. You're Sachi and I'm Sara. No, I know what. You Ilchi and you Bilchi. [Laughs] So, my name is Aunty Saluni. Ok. You girls have such beautiful voices. Can you sing some more for me? Ok. Ok. [Humming] We want to show you our room. I'd love to come and see. [Giggling] [laughing] Mama! Papa! Hello, Sara. Sachi. Who are you? What you doing with my girls? I found them wandering in the forest alone and I thought it was unsafe so I decided to bring them home and give them a bath. [Laughing] I hope you don't mind. That's alright. How kind of you. Um... Aunty Saluni. How kind of you, Saluni. (Both): Aunty Saluni. Ah, shush you two. How kind of you to take so much interest in our girls. My pleasure. [Laughing] Can I look after the girls sometimes when I'm not busy? That'd be very nice. But we can't afford to pay you. Maybe the occasional bottle of wine. You know, sometimes that's all they pay us on the vineyards. It'll be ok. Yeah? Ok. Whoopsie daisy! I thought today I should be nice. What do I do with these? Well, you can marinate them overnight and roast them. It's a peace offering, man. You can't do this to me! I'm in love, child. [Lively music plays] *** [lively music plays] *** [lively music plays] *** You can skulk away all you want, but you can't hide from the Lord. Amen! I don't have to hide from you, Peter LaRou. Do you think your father and your mother, God bless their soul, would have wanted you to turn your back away from the church? I think they would not be proud. Leave my parents alone! Do you hear me? Leave my parents alone! Shame. The whales have stolen his soul. All he has now is blowing his horn. For all, instead of the Lord. [Crowd cheering] Yea, Lord some have pity, man! And now, who is this woman who blasphemes against the messenger of the word? Say, it's Saluni... [cheering] No God-fearing christian must attend this play. So what's this play about, pastor? Ah, sis, it is about a sailor who is secretively in love with his captain. It is against the law to judge... you know. Yeah, it's against the law! [Crowd protests] The movie star is also a lawyer and a politician. [Crowd laughs] God must have mercy on your soul, my child. I am not your child. And there is nothing wrong with my soul, pastor. Oh. Sis, you can walk away all you want but let me tell you that no... shall enter the kingdom of God. [Cheering] Ok, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah. Wait, wait. Listen, we gonna be here tomorrow, we'll be here the next day, we're gonna be here for the next five days. So just- come on, get here early, bring your friends, bring your families, we'll record your jokes, your stories, your songs, we'll play it to the whole of Hermanus. Come back tomorrow. Come on, bring your friends. Children like to wander around. It's dangerous out there. What can we do? Children get bored. The bored twins. Your girls have beautiful voices. Ah, thank you. As fate would have it, there's a festival happening in town. There's a radio man there, he's gonna be there for the next five days recording. Yeah? There's this boy called Lunga. He sings for the tourists. He makes a lot of money. Is that what you want, Saluni? You want to make money off my children? No. No, I don't want their money. I just want to record with them. You've heard about those children that become stars and what they can do for their parents. No, Saluni. I don't want them to go to town and I don't want them to record. But you won't have to work on the farms anymore. Don't look at me. You're not the first one to say that we must record them. I tried to reason with her- I forbid it. Saluni, I forbid it. They will steal my children's voices. Fuck, aye... "Those machines are gonna steal my daughter's voices!" Saluni? Hello? You don't need them. Why don't you do it yourself? Come on, Saluni. Sing for us another song. [Chattering in agreement] What, do I look like a fucking juke box? Fuckin' hell. Just a little one, then. Walter. [Bang] Get me another drink. Sure, it'll make you feel better. Come on, girls! Where are you? I'm not in the mood for silly hide-and-seek games today. Girls? (Both): Aunty Saluni. What happened? Mama won't let us go to the Whale Call festival with you. [Giggling] See? I found you this time. These are my angels, Sara and Sachi. No, I'm Sara. She's Sachi. No, she's Sachi. I'm Sara. I just call them the Bored Twins. Just took them to the festival. Did you girls like it? Yes. Aunty, we bored. We bored, Aunty. We bored. The Bored Twins. Let's go! [Yelps] [hymn singing] [praying] [blowing horn] No. They can't have gone. They can't have gone. Saluni. Sorry. I thought you were someone else. Aye, Saluni. Fuck off. Hey. Why did you disappear? Fuck man! Can't a lady take a nap without being rudely awakened? Fuck. Vanilla, please. Mmm. So now you found me what you gonna do about it? I don't know. I was off to some place on some business. I didn't think I would find you here. So what happened to you? Since when do you care? Just wondering. Nothing happened. I must go now. You miss them, don't you? Yeah. Well, you know, I don't know what you see in them. They look stupid to me, man. They are beautiful. Beautiful? They have all those ugly warts on their faces. Hey, they're not warts. They are callosities, and- and they are beautiful. Those southern rides are graceful and they are big. Now, if it was the blue whale, that I could respect. How would you know about the blue whales? I'm sure you've never seen one. They never come close to the shore. I know that it's the largest mammal on earth. That I know. These other whales of yours, they're just toys, man. They don't tickle my fanny. [Laughs] I mean "fancy"! [Laughing] If you could be a whale, would you be the blue whale? [Giggling] Are you going to tell us a bedtime story, Aunty Saluni? Oooh, yeah! Good idea. Ok, let's get inside. And cuddle up. Nice and warm? Right. Once upon a time- Wait. We must first put out the lights. No, no, no, no, no, no. We're not going to put out the light, ok? But mama says you must save on electricity. Ok, well I've got my candle so get my candle. Why must we have the candle on? The story will be nice. The story won't be scary. Because Aunty Saluni is afraid of the dark, ok? [Giggling] What's so funny? It's not a laughing matter. Come, get back to that story now. Ok. Once upon a time- We don't know any adult who's afraid of the dark. You know, you girls are still too young to understand the world. It's not what it pretends to be. In a land far, far away, there lived a little girl called Selena, and she lived in a valley that was covered with trees that were made of pink candy floss. [Coughing] You're not doing to badly at this finding business, eh? I wasn't looking for you this time. No. I was looking for fronds to shape into my catapult. Oh yes, for your big fish that's coming from the southern seas. Sharisha is not a fish. You gave it a name? A whale is not a fish. Ach, man, it's no need to get your brookies into a knot. I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. I'm not losing any sleep. [Groans] What? I got lice. [Laughs] Are you laughing at my lice? Listen here. I'll have you know I don't go walking around like this normally. I am a lady. I never said a thing. Just so you know. I think I can help. Do you think I'm crazy? Try me. Ta-dah! If you think you can have your way with me you can forget it because I am a lady. My way? I didn't invite you to move in, I just said bring something to change so we can get rid of your lice. Yeah, well that's what they all say, you know. And then they're all over you like a rash. [Laughs] You're the first person to come in here, Saluni. Well, I am most honoured. It's modest, but... it's mine. Who's this? My mother. You were cute, hey? Your parents look lovely. Where are they? I don't talk about that. But they're on your wall. They deserted me. Just like that? Just like that. People always leave. Whales don't. They leave. They go back to the southern seas. But they come back. Like clockwork. Whales always come back. What happened? Let's deal with the lice. It stinks! It's sheep dip. What? Sheep dip. It won't kill you but it will kill the lice. I'll also use it to wash your clothes. You can get in the bath. You can help me with my strap if you want. No, I think I should leave. I'm just joking, man. Fuck! It burns! It's for the best. Do you want to come help me wash my back? It will kill the vermin feeding on your body. You're shy, hey? I like that in a man. [Screaming] What the shit are you doing, man?! I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to do anything. Never do that again! Switch on the light! I don't sleep in the dark. I don't walk in the dark, I don't do anything in the dark, do you understand me? I'm sorry. * * * * * Look, I'm- I'm not too sure that we can afford the food in this place. Oh, no, baby. We came to window eat. That means we eat with our eyes. Hey, listen. I'm gonna teach you how, ok? Look. Look, look, look. Now, you can actually taste the food with your eyes, ok? All you have to do is watch how they chew. Mmmhmm. And then see the enjoyment on their faces. Now, imagine the spicy flavours in their mouth. Mmm. When you can believe it- Yeah. You can taste it. Should we start with the sushi? The raw fish? No, no, no. That's not my taste. Fish is only good for me when it is covered with spicy butter, and fried with a lot of oil and served with nice golden chips. May I welcome you to the best restaurant in South Africa? Oh, yes. We beat the top restaurants in Cape Town and Johannesburg. No thanks. Ah. We have meat, pasta, and sushi. We are just looking. You know window shopping, sir? Now, we're just window eating. If you don't mind, we just want to look. Of course I mind. You will make my customers nervous by watching them like that. Please, just go and be spectators somewhere else. Hey, fuck you very much! [Laughs] If I see you here again, you vagrants, I will call the police! Yeah, fuck you! [Laughing] Didn't all that dining make you hungry for something? I got hungry for real food. [Laughs] I mean like when men and women go out to dine, it's like foreplay. [Sighs] I'm sick of your nonsense, man. What have I done now? It's what you haven't done that's the problem. What haven't I done? Tonight I'm gonna make you scream for your mother. You do wanna scream for your mother, don't you, hey? Come on. Take me. Let me hear you scream for your mother. [Whispers] I can't. I'm sorry. [Whale calling] [singing] *** [singing] *** [singing] *** Look at Lunga. Who's Lunga? Well, you would know who he is, he's here twice a week, if you weren't so busy with your fish. [Yelling angrily] [clapping] [yelling angrily] Come here, Lunga! Come here, baby. Come here, come here, come here. You know what? He's not gonna bother you, ok? [Yelling angrily] Are you ok? Here. I got this for you. For me? That's so sweet. But you know what? I don't take a drink anymore. That man doesn't like it. Baby, you look after yourself, ok? You be good, alright? It's ok to cry, man. You really are good with these children who sing, eh? First it was the Bored Twins and now... this Lunga boy. Yeah, you know, the twins, they have voices of angels. But Lunga, his voice is of the earth. The voice of a boy who has to come twice a week and on public holidays to sing for his supper. [Yelps] Saluni! Hey! [Gasping] [laughing] What you laughing for, man? It's not funny! You're beautiful. What? You said I was beautiful. You laugh. You laughed first. You never laugh. I always laugh. You brought the laughter into my life. [Laughing] Ah, come here! Let's go. When will you ever forget? Forget what? You have that faraway look in your eyes. I worry that out there you imagine your big fish jumping out of the ocean, doing all sorts of cool things for you. Hey, Sal, you're not searching my mind. No. It's the reason we haven't done anything meaningful for months. Looks like rain. Smells like rain. [Thunder claps] [screams] [gasping] [thunder claps] Nothing's going to happen to you, ok? Tonight. I'm really gonna make you scream for your mother. [Laughs] No! [Laughing] [moaning] [thunder rolls] [groaning] Mmm. My blue whale. Oh, we had to wait all that time for the rain and the thunder. Oooh. [Giggles] I bathed in you. Your waters of life and mine mixed. And our souls were cleansed. It was a wonderful cleansing ceremony, Saluni. [Giggles] It was sex, man. It was sex, pure and simple. You know what? You make it sound so crude. It was something sacred. Well, it's something you can't do with that fish. [Laughs] You don't know that, Saluni. You do not know that. * * * Shew. You have a lot of energy after last night. I have to keep up with you. I have to be fit. Ugh. I'm famished. Sis! Saluni, why didn't you cook? Because I wasn't hungry. Whenever you come home there is food. I don't cook because I am hungry. Man, relax. It's only food. If I cooked only because I'm hungry there would be no food in this house. Listen, I'm not your mother, ok? That's not why you brought me here. No, no! No, no, no! I didn't bring you here at all, you brought yourself! I'm not your mate, ok? Well, I cook for you but I'm also not your mate. [Snorts] Stop nit-picking, man. Stressing yourself out. Saluni, I cook because I care for you. And I'm not cooking for you because I am your servant. And I would expect you to return that caring. [Pots banging] [whales calling outside] They're back! They're back! They're back! Saluni. Saluni! How could you sleep through all this? They're back! The whales are back! They're back! They're back! [Blowing horn] [blowing horn] Yes! Yes! [Yelling indistinctly] Yes! Yeah, woman! [Singing] Yes! [Laughing] [singing] Yes! [Laughing] Girls? Aunty Saluni is here! Girls? [Knocking] Hello? Girls? Girls? You're burning up. Where were you? You left us. You don't care about us anymore, Aunty. You don't love us anymore. That's not true. Aunty Saluni, well, Aunty Saluni's been a little busy. It's different now. One day when you're big you'll understand. And I think it's 'cause papa no longer pays you in bottles of wine. That's nonsense. Aunty Saluni doesn't even take a drink anymore. And even when I did, I didn't come and visit you for the bottles of wine. Alright, come girls. Take a deep breath, ok? There you go. Aaah! Aunty! It's too hot in here. It's burning us! The steam is burning us! Ok, just relax, otherwise you're really going to burn. Breathe it all in and then you're gonna sweat that fever out. I promise you you're gonna feel better tomorrow. Very kind of you. Ok girls, make some space. I'm coming in. [Screams] What the-? Here, have a snake, Aunty. No, man. You can't do that to me! You almost gave me a heart attack! Sorry, Aunty. You can't do that to a love child, girls. (Both): What's a love child? What's a love child? Me. It's me. I was conceived on a windy day by a beautiful woman. Yeah. My mother was the most beautiful woman ever. She was in love with a married man. That's how I was born. He was a rich, old, married man. He said he loved my mother but he wouldn't leave his ugly wife. My mother pined for his love. Love began to eat at her until she was only bones. She became a walking skeleton. And troubadours- you girls know what troubadours is? Troubadours used to write about her love. Then, one day, those bones just fell in a heap on the ground. You know? My aunties used to tell me every day to be proud because I was a love child. I'm a bloody love child, man. And whether you want to listen or not, you've gotta treat me with care. I'm a love child. And that is what a love child is. That is what a love child is. [Blowing horn] That's my girl! Yes! [Laughing] [blowing horn] [cheering] [muttering indistinctly] Yeow! [Laughing] Stop this nonsense. Stop this rubbish with this fucking fish! Come home. You've shamed yourself and you've shamed me! You tired from all your dirty dancing with that fish? I forbid you to see her again. If he wants to go back to the way things were, please. Please, promise me. Promise me you'll leave her. Please. Or I'll leave. I'm waiting. Waiting for what? [Sobbing] [slams door] I knew I'd find you here. You're looking for me? Huh? For what? Huh? Why are you looking for me? Stop drinking. You're overdoing this, Saluni. Look at you now. Fuck off, man. Go back to your fuckin' fish! Fuck off! Get the fuck outta here! Go dance with your fucking fish, man! You got your fish! I've got my bottle! Saluni, the radio man is back. He's at the Windsor Hotel. He's looking for people to record. I'm adding my lines to the three tenors. Radio man's back? Yeah, he's back to record choirs. He set up a studio at the hotel. Is he gonna record your voice? Why not? You know what? I'm also gonna be a star. Let's get the fuck outta here. Aunty, please. You're walking too fast. Come. Please, aunty, you're walking too fast. Listen girls, listen to me. This is for your own good, ok? We gonna be stars. Yeah. Come. Ok, just wait. Hang on a sec. And... recording. * Did you hear the news on the radio today? * * People have agreed to give their love away, * * I can't wait to be there in line, * * aye, no, no, * No, no, no, * Doo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo * Do-do-do-do-do [giggles] Ok. Yes. Whew! Hoo-ah. Look at that, look at that. Woah, that's sensational. You guys rock. Whew. Mmm. I think I'm gonna cut a demo. What's a demo? Um, a demo is a CD, you see? Now, I take that CD and maybe a record producer will want to sign you up and give you a contract and if he gives you a contract he might give you a lucrative deal and, you see, 'cause I'm hip and I dig you guys, I'm gonna be your agent and your manager. And we gonna have Saluni and the Bored Twins: a Magical Trio. [Squeals] What did I say? What did I say, girls? But please, girls, not a word to your mother, ok? Give me a couple of days, alright? 'Cause I just gotta go in and I'll come back with a couple of CDs. Ok, but when do you think you're gonna be back with the CD? Because their mother doesn't want them to record and I think that if she hears their voices she'll change her mind. Bookie, it takes you 20 minutes to sing a song. It takes me 20 hours to mix and to master it so give me a break here. I'll come as quickly as I can. Ok, but just don't take too long. Thank you, anyway. Thank you. Bye. [Singing over bar chatter] [singing over bar chatter] [singing over jazz music] [singing over jazz music] [applause] [laughing] I'm gonna be a star, baby! I am gonna be a mega star! Oh, I'm gonna get onto a jet plane and I'm gonna captivate audiences all over the world. And you, you can come with me if you want. Even though you've been betraying me with that fish of yours. I am gonna show you that I've got a forgiving heart. [Laughs] I- I- I'll fly with you in your jet plane just like we window eat in those restaurants, you know, with all those delicacies. Man, no! It's not gonna be the same! No, we only window eat because we have to. No, this time, baby, we're not gonna be flying on our imagination. We're gonna be flying for real! We gonna get on a plane from here to Johannesburg and then from there we're gonna fly to Dhakkar and- and to Paris and to London and- oh, baby, we're gonna go to Hollywood! We're gonna take Hollywood by storm! Saluni and the Bored Twins. And you know what? The radio man, he's gonna be our promoter and he's gonna market us and you, you... what do you wanna be in all of this, hey? There's no airport in Hermanus, Saluni. So? Well, then- then I'm gonna take a limousine to Cape Town. And we can fly from there! Why do you have to be so difficult, man? Are you jealous of my fame? No. No, no, Saluni. I'll wait for you here. Do remember us little people when you're up there in the stars. Oh, no, baby. You're not little. You're big and strong. You're gonna be my man, baby. You'll keep my bed warm when I come home at night from Carnegie Hall, after I've been singing, I'll climb into a nice, warm bed. It's gonna be a good arrangement. You'll see. You know what? Don't worry with Sara and Sachi, the minute I hit the big time I'm gonna send them back home, ok? Because I, baby, I'm gonna be a solo act. Me and my big backing band. Oh. * I'm the woman for you, * You're the man for me, * Together baby, * We can be a family. You sure will be something. You sure will be. [Laughing] Take me in your arms and fuck me! No, no, no. It's daylight, Saluni. Who cares, man? Who says madness is only for the night, hey? [Laughing] You leave him alone, you stupid fish! He's mine! [Slap] There! Fucking fish. Bitch! Saluni, the mentholated spirit I use to clean my clothes is gone. Ugh, man. Don't tell me you drank it. It's just spirits, man. So how am I going to clean my clothes? I will buy you new clothes. I'm a star now. A celebrity. See? I got myself a whole new wardrobe. I'm going to miss you when you are a big star. Man, you stress too much. Stop getting so moody. I have to go to Hollywood without you first to get settled. You can't just drag a man to Hollywood without getting settled first. And besides, I wouldn't leave you. You're my blue whale. [Laughs] Saluni. Mmm? The coat. Don't you think you should give it a rest? I can imagine how much you're sweating under it. You know some poor animal had to die for you to look this beautiful. You know, animals die every day. We eat them, we wear them as shoes. He has returned, Aunt Saluni. The radio man is back. Did he bring the CDs? Yes, he has brought some CDs and he wants to see you. Yes! Wooo! He's at a hotel at seventh avenue. Oh. What did I tell you, hey? What did I say? You thought he wasn't gonna come back because you thought he was a scam. I never said anything of the sort. You didn't say it but you thought it. I could see it all over your face. And now the radio man wants to see me at a hotel. What do you say about that? Well, I say go for it. In fact, I'm coming with you to the hotel. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I've got a brilliant idea. Come, come! What? What? You still don't wanna tell me what the surprise is? They didn't tell me, either, man. They said it'll be good for us. We'll find out now at the hotel. I want the twins to go with us. What kind of surprise is that? I don't know. You know I don't like surprises. Hi. Hallelujah. Hi! Ta-dah! Come, come. Wait, uh... uh, Saluni, uh... where are the twins? Oh, I brought their parents. I thought that maybe you could tell us about how we're gonna be big stars. No! I need the twins, now! Chillax. Just play us the CD. Don't tell me to relax. Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Mind your language, there. There are ladies in here. It doesn't work. I don't understand it, I don't get it, but it doesn't work. [Plays jumbled recording] Ok. Did you know about this? Uh-uh. I only know this today. These people, they deceived us. No. I- I- when I first heard it, it was psychedelic. And, uh, then this happened. But the thing is I came here today so that I could take Saluni and the Bored Twins to a state of the art recording studio down in Cape Town. My goodness. Yeah. They're not going to Cape Town. And they're not recording their voices again, ever. Please don't do this to your girls. I don't want to have anything to do with you. You- you don't talk to me and you leave my girls alone! Fine. Fine! Keep them then, I don't need them. I'm going to Cape Town, and I'm going to be a solo act. No, you're not, darling. The thing was, it was Saluni and the Bored Twins. No Bored Twins, no deal. I really don't know what happened. Please, I need those girls today. The machine stole their voices. You nearly ruined my girls. Come. Go! Go! Huh? She can sing, Mr. Radio Man. She's got a wonderful voice. I can. Please, I can be a solo act. Who's the little person? No, you can't be a solo act. Let me tell you something. You've got the kind of voice that I can find in any bar or shebeen anywhere in this country. I can sing with her. I also have a good voice. Let me make this clear. It was Saluni and the Bored Twins, but I was going to dump you, anyway, because the Bored Twins have a chance at an international career but you have a shit voice. And I don't want your shit voice messing up their angelic sound. Is that clear? Who's this guy? [Thud] Let's go! Let's go! I'm sorry, I had to do it. I hate violence. I'm not the fighting type. Arrogant bastard. He can't talk to you like that. No. No. Come- come, let's go. Let's keep going. Come, let's keep- Don't touch me! Stay with me. Don't leave. Now that your fish is back you treat me like rubbish. No, no, no, Saluni. I'm not treating you like rubbish, it's just... I hope something bad happens to that fish. One day she's gonna end up on someone's dinner plate in Japan and the world's gonna be a better place. [Whale calling] Sharisha! No. No. They're raping her. They're raping her, the bastards. Get away from her! Get away from her! You rapists! [Yelling indistinctly] Oh, baby. Sharisha! Sharisha! [Yelling] [whale calling] * * Don't do that. Those glasses are meant to protect us from going blind. Woah. You're in a war-like mood today. Why are you challenging- Don't touch me. You will go blind, Saluni. [Laughing] I am blind. I'm blind. Why did you do that? Why did you do that, Saluni? Because there's nothing left to see anymore. Because the sun, the moon, and the stars betrayed me. It's hot, Saluni. You don't need that coat. I've told you before, man. I know how to prepare. You're leaving. You don't need a candle, you are blind, Saluni. Saluni, you don't have to go. This- this is your home. This is your home. There's nothing left for me in Hermanus. Everyone has abused me. The whales, the Bored Twins' mother. Even you. We- we've- we've had our good times, too, haven't we? I'm going. You'll be better off without me. On a journey? She's gone blind, and I'm going to be helping her on the road. Where to? On a journey of no destination. [Sighs] So you are helping people now? What happened to the whales? Saluni, this is madness. A journey without a destination? Come, let's go. We must sleep. We have a long way to go. Like I was saying... in blindness one is able to reach into the depths of one's soul to recover all of the beautiful things that one once knew in past existences. How would you know? You have never been blind. Well, now that I've met the beautiful Saluni, I'm considering blindness for myself and all of my sheep. Did you switch off the light? I can feel the darkness. If the beautiful lady needs the light, the beautiful lady will have the light. She's blind, for crying out loud. I will read for you, beautiful lady. I will read for you from the holy book. The song of Solomon. The song of songs. "Behold, my love. You are fair, my love. Behold, you are fair. You have dove's eyes behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats coming down mount Gilead. No. No. No. This walking backwards of yours is slowing us down. It breaks up the monotony of the road. You haven't brushed your teeth. Why must I brush my teeth? I'm not gonna see anybody. You will be seeing me. Did you brush your teeth when you were dirty dancing with the fish? Hey, man. Hey, son! Son! Son, man! Where were you? I brought you something to drink. Every time you leave I think you're going to return to your fish. Saluni, I am not with Sharisha. I am here taking care of you. [Scoffs] Doesn't matter. That fish is always here getting in the way of our love. I'm tired of your insecurities. Read me something from the song of songs? Oh please, not again. You're just jealous because that shepherd saw something beautiful in me. Jealous of the country bumpkin? Well, he read to me. Ok, fine. How beautiful are your feet in sandals, oh princess's daughter? The curves of your thighs are like jewels. The work of the hands of a master craftsman. Your navel is like a goblet. It lacks no blended beverage. Your waist is like a heap of wheat, suckled with lilies. Your two breasts are like two fawns. Twins. Of a gazelle. Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are like pools of- That's really beautiful. Did you steal his bible from him? I didn't his bible. Then how do you know it word for word? I know the bible, Saluni. I grew up in the Church of the Sacred Kelp Horn. I never knew you were so romantic. There's a lot you don't know about me. [Gasps] You put out the light? No, Saluni. It's just your imagination. I thought, in blindness, I could travel the world without fear of darkness. In blindness, I thought there's no light, and if there's no light there's no darkness. But I was wrong. My body still feels the darkness. There's a car. How do you know, Saluni? I can see the light. But the sky is dark. Where have the stars gone? We're back in Hermanus? Fucking liar. You knew all along you were leading me back here. Your fish. You lied to me. You lied to me about my candle. You lied to me! I trusted you and you lied to me! You're a fucking liar! You're a dirty fucking bloody liar! All for your fucking fish! I gave up my shit for you! For you! And for what, huh? For what? So you can turn your fucking back on me? Talk to me! Fine. Don't talk to me for the rest of your fucking life. I don't care. Suits me. Oh, suits me! Suits you, yeah. Suits you, because you know what? You don't care. You never did. Oh, I cared, Saluni. I care, Saluni. All you care for is your fucking fish. Your fucking Sharisha! Oh, I care! Why do you think I've- I've spent fucking months on the road with you! Why didn't you ever say you love me anymore? Why don't you ever tell me I'm beautiful? How can I say you're beautiful when you are so ugly? To me! No man has ever told me that before. No man! [Sobbing] [blowing horn] Come on. Come. Come, Sharisha. Sharisha! Sharisha! [Blowing horn] Sharisha! Sharisha! Sharisha! Sharisha! [Singing together] Aunty Saluni! Aunty Saluni, are you ok? Babies. We missed you, Aunty Saluni. Where were you? [Blowing horn] Ah, you're here, my love. You're here, my love. [Whale groaning] Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Please! Please, people, help! Please, help! Help! Please! The whale has beached! Please, help! Help! [Giggling] We have done everything we can... [chatter] Please, do something! Do something! Please, help us! Please! I told you. Look. The tide. The tide's coming in. It's going to save him. It wasn't the tide, daddy. It was that man over there.
