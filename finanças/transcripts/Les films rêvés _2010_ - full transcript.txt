Well. It would be slow. Gentle as a dream. An object thrown into the unknown. It could be called... It would be called... Dreaming Films Some films are silent and some films speak, some films act and some films watch. There are films of memories and memories of films. Some films have shut eyes, others open them. Some films say goodbye, others say farewell. Some films tell no story, others tell a story. Some films laugh, and others cry. Some films take the gods' point of view, some take man's point of view. Some films travel, others stay put. Some films remember, others forget. Finally, there are the films I dreamed then made... and the films I dreamed but never made. These are the dream films. It would be the story of a film that starts in a cabin and ends with a storm, a sand storm, or a wind storm, or a sea storm, but a real storm. One day... One day, a man... One day, a man, a filmmaker... One day, a man, a filmmaker had a dream. He dreamed of making a film that would contain all the films he had dreamed of making. Imaginary Map of Dream Film Territories. It is the dream of a child who was told the story of Ulysses, that fragile man, who was clever, who lied, who travelled so far from his loved ones. Ulysses, this is the first journey. It would all start in Troy, for it was there, under the great walls, that the great hero Achilles died, and from there that Ulysses left on his great odyssey, preferring the sea and adventure over the heroism of battle. The film would show his journey, the strange islands he passes, beautiful and unsettling, like the Island of the Sirens. But above all, there would be the island where he washes up alone, that of the beautiful Calypso, the goddess who falls in love with him and keeps him seven long years by her side. She promises him immortality, paradise, but Ulysses leaves, because to journey is to leave and to return, because he loves the passing of time. And he returns to Ithaca, where his wife and son await him, where his dog, Argos, also awaits and who will be the first to recognize him. Then there is Rouch, the traveller, the filmmaker, the master, for whom films are about sharing, a 'potlatch', as he used to say. A few years ago, Rouch came to my home and Boris, another filmmaker had come to film him, get him to talk about cinema. What we do is improvise, which means being able to move around, get up and go to look at an insect, whatever. All the rest... the image doesn't matter a bit. The image will be good if it means something. But focusing and all that, I don't believe in it. So that's what it is and the only one capable of filming and understanding is that little dog. He has his camera in his nose. He looks with his nose, his sense of smell. Filming is like playing with a dog. You throw something he likes that he can bring back to you. That's cinema. Thank you. Great sequence. Great sequence! Because you too thought of the cinema, a film, as a strange object flung into the unknown, which comes back to you later. Could you define 'potlatch'? Potlatch means sharing surplus. We all have a surplus of dreams, of means, of food, etc., that we must share. One thing I feel is essential is necessary waste. One must waste one's energy and one's riches, on one condition, that you do so with people who will do the same in their turn. Then one day, by phone, a friend told me of his death in an accident, one night on a road in Niger. I didn't know what to say. I grabbed my camera and filmed, dreamed these images for him. When Jean Rouch died, a legend was born: Mahatma the spirit, Mahatma the Touareg, had snatched his soul. And I dream of seeking it out. But how do you seek, how do you show a soul? In Polynesia, the soul is represented by the ray. One day, a traveller came, with a portrait by Raphael. When he showed it to four old men on an island, where the art of portrait painting was unknown, they all said: "Magnificent. Yes, we recognize it." Intrigued, the traveller asked what they saw. They all replied: "A ray!" I dream of going to place this covvry on Jean's tomb and I dream of seeking his soul. Legend has it that Arrako Gikko, the river spirit, Mahatma the Touareg's mother, took back Jean's soul. Legend has it that his soul has become the guardian spirit of the river, in this loop of the Niger where hippopotamuses swim, where he lived, worked and filmed all his life. This is where Rouch made his first film. When he shared it, screening it for the locals, the Sorko fishermen asked him to take out the music, so as not to frighten the hippopotamuses. One day, Stany came to visit, before leaving to sail around the world. He left, promising to bring back images for me to dream on. Look, it's the little blue tortoise I found on the beach that day. It was just before I left to sail around the world. Remember? You asked me to set him free in the land of the tortoises. There's a film I've always wanted to make, something lodged within me like the trace of a gaze. I remember an adolescent sitting at the table of a night club astray in a foreign land. I remember the sonata, her body, the first woman's body I ever saw. I remember the atmosphere, the smoke, and what her gaze said about the gaze of men. We should evoke the travellers, the sailors, speak of those who left first, of their leap into the unknown. When a man like Columbus leaves to discover America, even those condemned to death refuse a pardon to leave with him. But those sailors were the first to sail far from land, losing sight of it, surrounded by water only. And they knew that whatever happened, nobody would come to save them. Those sailors made songs about their fears and their solitude. Weeks, surrounded by the ocean, believing they saw mermaids rise from the water... until the first signs of land. The first thing they truly saw of the new world was this... It was dark and without realizing it, they had come close to the first island. This is what they saw. The next day, they realized it was the lights of the Indians coming outside at night, to relieve themselves. The Indians believed the sailors had come from the sky, the sailors were certain they had found paradise. The mixed waters, of different colours, all around them, proved them right, they were indeed in paradise. The world was thought to be the shape of a pear. Paradise was right at the top. From this spring flowed the four rivers known at the time. It was therefore normal that around paradise, the waters be of mixed colours. All this can be found in Las Casas. If a film were to be made about one of the first travellers, it would be him, the churchman, Bartholomew de las Casas. He was Columbus's companion, went on the first journeys and told it all in his amazing "History of the Indies". Las Casas is wonderful. When he pondered the production of pearls, which the sailors saw for the first time, he recounted that oysters came onto the beach at night and walked, opening and closing their valve, until they reached the first blades of grass. There, they lay down and opened wide, awaiting the first drop of morning dew, which would later become the pearl. Then, the oysters would quickly return to the sea. When he reached Cuba, the first big island they discovered, Las Casas wrote: "They saw nightingales singing very softly, and it is good to think there's a land where nightingales sing in November." But Cuba was also the first experiment in enslavement, for wherever the white man thought he had found heaven, he turned it into a hell. Las Casas tells stories from another point of view, as with the first Indian rebellion. The Spanish had just arrived on the island of Cuba and went on land to celebrate. They left 8 crew members on board, to guard the Indians they had taken prisoner. But the latter rebelled, killed their guards, raised the anchors and left with the ship. From the shore, the Spaniards watched them disappear into the horizon. Cuba brought the discovery of tobacco. The first to bring it back to Europe were excommunicated. Las Casas talks of "pipes of smells", of "|it comets, full of scented herbs that intoxicate and lull the body to sleep." Later, it was in these places, while tobacco was rolled, that Alexander Dumas' "Count of Monte Cristo" was read out loud, for years. I read it as a child, looking at the picture of Danton, trapped in the hell of his prison. Dreaming a film based on blue. The blue of the sea and the blue of the sky. Blue, the color of eternity, of paradise, the world of before, where men and animals spoke the same language and lived in peace. In Ulysses' era, the Masters of Time wore blue. And finding near this little town at the "edge of the world", as Ulysses called it, the island of Calypso, whence he set off to join his family. He returns and Argos awaits him. Home at last, but one day, Ulysses would leave once more. The first man to go to paradise and come back was Lucian of Samosata. Around 180 A.D., Lucian made the first trip to the moon. On his way back, he stopped off in paradise. He saw cities of gold and rubies, temples of emeralds and diamonds bathed in an eternal dawn. The ears of corn bore little loaves, there were fountains of honey, milk and wine. Here, souls once again took on a human shape and Lucian described his meeting with Ulysses, who gave him a letter for Calypso. In the story, in ancient Greek, Lucian repeats Ulysses' words: "Now that I am in paradise, I miss the pleasures we had together. I wish I had always stayed by your side, and accepted your offer of immortality. If I can escape, rest assured, you will see me again. Farewell, Ulysses." Then there's the paradise my mother described, the paradise she saw as a child and wanted to return to. Sometimes, we spent the afternoon at my grandparents'... Sometimes, we spent the afternoon at my grandparents', not far from our home. Their red brick house was surrounded by a magnificent garden containing all sorts of flowers, fruit trees, redcurrants, and raspberries. I imagined I was in the Garden of Eden. And under the apple tree, I saw Eve hold out the apple to Adam, the snake that curled around the tree, then the Good Lord chasing them out of the Garden of Eden into the big wasteland just opposite my grandparents' place. A friend sends me a postcard from Las Casas in Mexico. Bartholomew de las Casas stayed here for years. The Indians named the city after him because he was the first to defend them, to say they had a soul, just as he was the first to question the role of the White man, the first to say you must not dream for others. It would be the story of a man, a traveller, who spent his life filming railway tracks, endlessly fleeing, all over the world. In the 16th century, the Mughal Emperor Babar wrote: "If paradise on earth exists, it is here, in Kashmir." Across these Himalayan landscapes, the Frenchman, Bonin, set off. After several attempts, in 1900, he finally became the first Westerner to reach Tibet. After a crazy journey, he neared Koko Nor, the Great Blue Lake. In his notes, ever more enthusiastic, he described the mad night winds, the rooftop of the world, the tribes of nomadic Mongols and Tibetans travelling in thousands to visit Genghis Khan's tomb, to pay tribute to him. But today, all researchers agree that there is not, nor ever has been, neither there, nor anywhere else, a tomb to Genghis Khan. Could his whole journey have been but a dream? There's a film to be made about Magellan, about the man and his crazy project to be the first to travel around the world. The world was known to be round and much bigger than first thought, but no one was sure a passage existed south of South America, to go all the way round. No one knew. Magellan, without knowing if he'd ever return charters a fleet and sets off. Five ships leave the European continent on September 20th, 1519. After three years of travelling, only one ship would return to Spain. All along South America, ever more doubtful, Magellan seeks the passage. The fleet weathers storm after storm, suffers a mutiny, one boat founders on a reef, another deserts and returns to Europe, but Magellan perseveres. It took him over a year to reach the passage, which would later be named the Strait of Magellan. There, after months without seeing a living soul, they spotted the Patagonian Indians on the shore, clothed in animal pelts. But they fled when they approached. At night, they saw their fires and called the desolate shore, Land of Fire. The Patagonian Indians were the last ones to travel down South America in their migration to the end of the earth, carrying with them the dream culture common to all Amerindian peoples. The lnextiua celebration is the rite when one seeks one's destiny. Here is what a 16th century monk had to say about it: "During this feast, they said all the gods were dancing, so all those dancing dressed up as various characters, some as birds, others as animals and some metamorphosed into butterflies, others into bees or beetles. Still others carried a sleeping man on their back, saying it was the Dream..." For Magellan's crew, the ordeal of the Pacific was awful. Three months of sailing with no sight of land. Many died of hunger before reaching the heavenly islands. They were welcomed like gods. But everywhere they went, despite Magellan's orders, the sailors couldn't resist the island girls and sowed discord wherever they went. He who wrote the tale of the journey, tells us: "In exchange for one knife, you get two or three girls, whose only clothing is their hair, and this for a lifetime." In the Philippines, Magellan was killed in an expedition against a local lord. The ship then sailed on, and set course for Europe. Months later, only one ship and 18 sailors made it to Spain. But none of them was the first to sail around the world, as History would have it. The first man to sail around the world, of whom no portrait exists, was Enrique, Magellan's slave, companion, and shadow. A native of Malaysia, Enrique had followed his master all over, even on his trip around the world. But in the Sunda Islands, Enrique's mother tongue is spoken and he acts as interpreter, Magellan is killed and Enrique disappears. I imagine Enrique back on his island, grown old, far from the history of the world. He dreams of the story of Serrao, whom he knew so well... Many reasons have been given to explain Magellan's attempted world tour. Perhaps Serrao is the explanation. Ferdinand de Magellan and Francisco Serrao had been close friends for years. In 1512, Serrao leaves for the Maluku Islands via the Indies. On his way back, his ship founders on a reef but he survives and returns to the Maluku Islands. There, forgetting Portugal and the spice trade, Serrao and his crew desert and stay in this endless paradise. Serrao will not be remembered as a great conquistador, but perhaps this Ulysses, enamored of his Calypso, was the wisest and happiest of captains. Serrao remained there 9 years and had three children before dying the same year as Magellan, and not so very far from him. For years, Serrao on his far-off island corresponded with Magellan as he prepared his trip. Yes, his friend described the delights of paradise and invited him to come and join him there. Meanwhile, Stany continues his voyage. He has passed the Strait of Magellan and is heading towards Easter Island. Every day, he notes his latitude and longitude. Every day, he draws the sky and the sea at that moment. With his filmed images of the sea, he sends me these drawings. It's the most isolated land on the planet, the last land to be colonized by humanity. The Polynesians, coming from the Marquesas Islands, travelled thousands of kilometers, following migratory birds, and stopped on this island. After the longest known maritime odyssey, they felt they had found paradise, the belly button of the world, a land for the spirits of the ancestors. But in the 17th century, all the island's trees died of drought and the inhabitants, no longer having ships, were prisoners of their paradise, a tiny dot in the ocean. Stany sets sail for the Galapagos Islands to drop off the blue tortoise in the land of tortoises. A swallow signals that land is close. The swallow is the bird of paradise, a symbol of migration and the return of the soul. There are so many images of journeys and so few of those who stay behind. So few of those who stay behind and dream their journeys. Trying to capture the invisible, that which is archaic in a mother's relationship with her child. Filming the imperceptible mirror. Jean-Marie, neighbour and friend. His balcony overlooks my garden. From one institution to another, Jean-Marie's life has not been easy. He never travels. He often stays home, in his little apartment, he whose heart is as big as a house. He comes around to chat of this and that, of you and me, of this film that's sprouting and growing like a plant, like a tree. We dream and we film. We dream and record sound. And one day we say: "Ah, there's the film I desire." Jean-Marie is part of the waking dreams, of the dream films. Is the image OK, like that? - Yes. Like this I've just got your head. Don't you think you should do it properly, the whole thing? - Like that, yes. It's much better. You mustn't change the image. You must leave the image the way you filmed it. Otherwise, your image of the person filmed will break his heart and that of the person who filmed. I think lots of people no longer have respect for that, for that profession. They lack respect for themselves, because they want the person to change, to show something other than what they really are. And that's impossible. Is this OK? - Yes, that's fine. I wondered if you believe in paradise and above all, how you imagine it to be. Well, imagining paradise! Everyone has their own take on paradise. It's just that we get the wrong impression sometimes. Sometimes, we're even disappointed. And if it's a disappointment, it's not worth it. That's why giving an image of paradise is beyond any person. On the map, I show Jean-Marie James Bruce's journey in Abyssinia. In the 18th century, Bruce, a noble Scot, also called the "Marco Polo of Africa", decided to go looking for the petrified town of Ras Sem. Legend has it that the inhabitants have been frozen for centuries, like statues, in the position they were in when God's wrath fell on them. He wrote down his adventures and illustrated them himself. Bruce crossing a waterfall in search of the source of the Blue Nile. Bruce dressed as an Arab, bowing to the Emperor of Abyssinia. Bruce pays tribute to the favourite wife of the King of Sennam. After an incredible journey of four years, braving death countless times, grown rich, then robbed by bandits, he finally returned to Cairo, in rags, a mere ghost. Many claimed his tale was pure invention, that he had never set foot in Africa. But the truth was never known. One of the most extraordinary travel tales is that of Rougemont. Louis de Rougemont, a Frenchman, is shipwrecked with pearl hunters in the 19th century, off the coast of Australia. He finds himself alone in an unknown land where he will spend 30 eventful years in the Australian outback. He is miraculously saved during the shipwreck, helped by his dog, now his sole companion. He tames turtles. He finds an Aborigine partner who takes care of him. He becomes chief of a cannibal tribe that he leads into war against his enemies. He saves two young English girls from the clutches of the natives. But everyone dies and alone he finds his way back to civilization. He becomes famous and his book is translated all over the world. But gradually, as the episodes of his story appear, month by month, his story is called into question. It seems this incredible 30-year crossing of Australia had been invented. Even his identity was apparently fake. Rumour had it that he had invented his tales in the reading room of the British Museum, surrounded by the travel stories he loved. Rougemont disappeared as mysteriously as he had appeared. A sole witness later claimed he had seen a bearded tramp selling matchsticks in the streets of London. It seems his whole story was fake... Perhaps. For here, another man enters the picture". Lander, the Englishman, Savage Landor, the man who went three times around the world. He discovers Tibet around the same time as Bonin, crosses frozen peaks alone, and, pursued by an army of 2000, climbs the Himalayas without equipment. Then he continues to travel the world. He crosses the African jungle from west to east, journeys down South America, travels all over North America, and sets sail for Japan, where he disappears into 6000 km of dense forest. Many of his trips were called into question and doubt was cast over his extravagant adventures, but publishers fought for his manuscripts and Landor became famous. He was a good drawer and he sketched landscapes, and portraits of people he met on his travels. After Japan, he set sail for Korea and crossed China before arriving in Australia. And there, at the end of his journey, it would appear that Rougemont's extraordinary adventure crossed Landor's path. Landor met and made a portrait of an Australian adventurer whose face strongly resembles that of Rougemont. If this really is Rougemont, as is supposed, and if Landor really did go there and met him, then Rougemont's whole story could also be true... Then there's the story of the forger, Van Megeren. All his life, he painted Vermeers, fakes, of course, but not copies, paintings one could imagine Vermeer might have done. Everyone was dupe. He even sold a canvas to Marshall Goering, a great art lover. When the Americans found the painting at the end of the war, they traced it back to Van Megeren. He was tried and risked the death penalty for having sold a Vermeer to the enemy. Van Megeren denied the charge, claiming he had conned Goering by selling him a fake. But the experts were unanimous, this, and the other Vermeers, were genuine. So, to prove the truth and save his life Van Megeren painted a fake Vermeer in his prison cell, and was set free. Long ago, in the beginning, in paradise, men and animals lived together and spoke the same language. There are many animals in the garden, but mostly, there are frogs. They're the only ones I know, but they're incredibly curious. In all cultures, everywhere, stories tell of the breakdown of equality between animals and humans. Ours is that of Noah and the story of the flood. When the floods came, Noah saved those animals he could. But when he got back to land after his journey, for no good reason, he became a carnivore, thus breaking his pact. It brings to mind a story my granda told me when I was little. When God at last finished creating the world and all things, he created heaven. But one day, the animals, all the animals, came together, because they too wanted to go to heaven. So, they sent representatives to God. And God said perhaps they were right since He had created them, but that He would not tolerate dirt in His home. Time passed, heaven was starting to fill up, and now all sorts of animals were there. But one day, the inevitable happened. God walked in some poop. Furious, he gathered everyone together and asked: "Who pooped in my Heaven?" As no one replied, God repeated loudly: "I'm warning you, I know about droppings. This was clearly done by a dog. May that dog come forward, or I'll throw all the dogs out of heaven, forever!" But the dogs all glared at each other and none of them came forward. So God banished them from heaven, once and for all. "That is why," my grandfather said, "When one dog meets another, he sniffs his backside and asks: 'Surely you're not the one, who pooped in paradise?"' I don't know if animals have a soul, or the extent of their awareness, but I know they dream. We are surrounded by strange animals and we all pick our own. Ulysses was pursued by bird-mermaids. But there are all sorts of mermaids. When I sang that, I dressed up as a mermaid. I don't know why I went to dance In St. Jean, At the popular dances. But all it took was one kiss, For my heart To be taken prisoner. How could I not lose my mind, Wrapped in those daring arms? For we always believe, Those sweet words of love When they're spoken With the eyes. I, who loved him so, Thought him the most handsome In St. Jean. I was drunk, Powerless before his kisses. Then there's Jacobson's mermaid, in Denmark. Jacobson was the youngest member of a family of brewers, the Jacobsons. From a young age, he had a rebellious nature. As soon as he could, he founded his own brewery, Carlsberg beer, and made a fortune. In the final years of his life, he went to the theatre to see a ballet, The Little Mermaid, based on a fairy tale where a young mermaid wants to marry a man and become a human being because her mermaid grandmother had told her that men live shorter lives, but have an eternal soul. Old Jacobson fell in love with the young performer, Ellen Price. It was to her memory that he commissioned the statue that now stands at the entrance to Copenhagen port. Regarding animals, there is one story, a true one, that I would like to film. It's about a pigeon. Well, in the beginning, it's about a man, somewhere in England, who loved pigeons, loved to watch them fly, and sent them on journeys. One day, he sent a young pigeon off on a journey. Then awaited its return. He waited four years. One day, he got a phone call from China. His pigeon had got lost. It was found 10,000 km from home, in the Sichuan mountains. In the end, after much discussion, the Chinese decided to let it leave... by plane. A Chinese air company took charge of getting it home. There, that was the tale of the homing pigeon, also known as "the Ulysses of birds". When William Winchester, inventor of the Winchester rifle, died in California, he was busy building a new home for himself and his wife, Sarah. Soon, a legend was born: as soon as the building was finished, it would be haunted by the souls of the thousands of Indians killed by the Winchester rifle. Sarah, the widow, believed the tale and for 38 years, she did not stop building the house night and day, which grew bigger and bigger. In 1922, when she died, the residence contained over 950 doors, leading to 160 rooms, including 40 bedrooms and 6 kitchens. There should be a film about the life of Curtis. For over 35 years, he photographed the Indians of North America, travelling from tribe to tribe. His work includes thousands of plates. When White men, foreigners who were building a railway on Indian territory, asked him if they could hire some young Indians of his tribe, Smohalla, Indian chief, replied: "My young men will never work. Men who work cannot dream and wisdom comes to us through dreams." In Canada, among the Kwakiutl tribe, Curtis shot one of the very first films in the history of the cinema: magical images of the return of the animal masks. The word 'potlatch' comes from the Kwakiutls: sharing, giving to another who will later give back more. Monarch butterflies leave from Canada and migrate 5000 km to Mexico. I dream of following them to the Huichol Indians. It is the most mysterious of all animal migrations. Each butterfly, which has never flown the route, leaves alone. Gradually, it is joined by the others. They arrive by millions in the Mexican mountains. Dreaming of going with the Huichol Indians, across the desert in search of the sacred cactus. A pilgrimage in search of peyote, the hallucinogenic cactus that guides their dreams and imaginary journeys. But there are times when the strength of a dream, of a desire, wakes you up, and reality takes over... Then you must get up and leave. End of Part 1 Dreaming Films Part 2 There are times when the strength of a dream, of a desire, wakes you up and reality takes over. Then you must get up and leave. There are imaginary places one tries to mark on a map to make them real. And there are real, terribly real places, that one cannot forget if one has been there, and which figure on no maps, so great is the shame. The penal colony of Tazmamart is not shown on any map of Morocco. Salah Hachad spent 18 years in Tazmamart in the Moroccan desert, freezing in winter, stifling in summer, wrongly accused for participating in a coup against the king. For 18 years, Salah Hachad did not see the blue of the sky. When I read his story, I wanted to meet and film him. If there was only one film, it would be that one, to tell the crumbling of time and the resistance of human beings. Filming this man to speak of all men. And I would get up and go to see him. He would show me the cell he has recreated. He would show me how he managed to survive, without going mad, or blind. It took Salah Hachad 10 months to make what the prisoners codenamed the "Kabazal": a little mirror set on the top of palm stems fixed end to end. Pushed through the air hole in the ceiling, the Kabazal, in the total darkness of the cell, saved his life. Then, all of a sudden, barn! Light came inside, a small, bright white spot. I was euphoric. I shouted and jumped, I cried. It was pure joy. Ah, I see my hand! It's hard to describe the emotion. You're in the dark for 10 months, and all of a sudden, you see a patch of light. Salah Hachad resisted, struggled, for 18 years, but other prisoners didn't have his strength and dreamed their escape. He started by telling me: "You know, Captain, it's easy to get out of Tazmamart. All you have to do is hang yourself, they'll get you and take you outside, and then at night, you escape." I understood then that he was... He was no longer normal. I told him: "If you carry on talking like that, it's over between us!" He said: "No, I'm only joking." But in the end, he carried out his plan. He escaped. - Yes, he escaped. It's true. For him, it was an escape. "I'll hang myself, they'll put me outside with the others." For him, the others who had died had escaped. What struck me was the power of the dream, of the imagination. At one point you say: "I travel to my wife..." It's not just the sexual aspect, but even life itself. Sometimes I would wrap myself up in my blanket, like a Mexican, and I'd close my eyes and hup, I'd go outside and start to live outside, on a farm, making plans... For years, he planned his imaginary farm: the various buildings, the electrical circuits, the animals in the yard, the number of milk cows, the number of fruit trees, where they'd be planted. One fine day, a little pigeon, fresh out of its egg, fell into the corridor. And it was our friend, Marzouki... The bird fell in front of his cell just when they opened the door for him to get his food. He saw the pigeon and picked it up. And that was it, for months afterwards, we lived for 'Mr. Farrach'. Farrach means... We chose the name Farrach because it means 'liberty. But his color... Because there was no light, he lived inside with us, there was no sunlight, he didn't go pigeon-coloured. He stayed a weird color due to lack of sunlight. In the end, he grew strong. We would open the little hatches and Marzouki would let Farrach go. He would whizz up and down the corridor at great speed, from one comer to another. We loved it! When he passed, one after another we'd put our hands out of the hatch, and he'd come and sit on them. We'd stroke him and talk to him, then he'd fly off again. We had a great time with Farrach. Then one day, we thought: "Well, really, we should let him go, give him his liberty, Farrach has grown." So It took almost a whole day of debate, serious debate. Some wanted to keep him, others said: "No, nothing is more precious than liberty, we must set him free." Then Marzouki came and passed him through... Above the corridor between the cells there was wire netting made of barbed wire. He pushed him through and let him go. But the terrible thing was that the other pigeons wanted nothing to do with him. Because he didn't look like them. Maybe it was his color. They attacked him! So he came back to us. Two days later, we tried again. This time it worked and he flew away. Then, and this is truly wonderful, one day, after about a month, maybe 20 days, he came back, accompanied by another pigeon. He had married! And he came back and landed just above Marzouki's cell where he sat cooing with his lady love. We were so happy. "Ah, he's married, he's come to bid us farewell." Some even cried. It was really moving, that little pigeon... Before we parted, as he was driving me back, he suddenly said to me, at a crossroad: "You know, I feel as if everything here, this street, that man, those trees, you and me... that all this is just a dream and I will soon wake up in Tazmamart. All he had told me about hell was so present within me that for a brief moment, I felt I was part of his dream. Then he added: "When I got back my freedom, for weeks and months I had this awful feeling: 'All this isn't real, I'm still dreaming, I'll soon wake up in Tazmamart.' Surviving. Surviving so that words never die. We had to survive, to speak for those who were buried along the walls of Tazmamart. At least one of us must survive the savagery, lest memory forget. Lest History forget. Lest stone forget. Lest blood forge One day, a man, a filmmaker, has a dream. It is the dream of a little boy who was told the story of Ulysses, the man who lived happily with his family, then left one day. It's the story of a man who went to Africa to film men and spirits, whose soul became the guardian of the river. It's the story of a man who dreamed of finding the Garden of Eden, that fabulous place from mythical times where men and animals lived in the same world. It's the story of a man, an unknown slave, who, without realizing it, was the first to go around the world. It's the story of a man, unjustly imprisoned, who waited like a beast for 18 years before he saw the blue sky once more. It's the story of a man who sailed around the world and who sent his filmmaker friend images from all over the world. I remember this man. At his home, I saw this photo: a young woman and a sequoia. Then he took me into his garden and showed me the sequoia he'd brought back from Canada: a baby. And for the first time, I saw a man taller than a sequoia. The Japanese say a garden is the portrait of a soul. Since then, Andre has left us and the sequoia continues to grow. Stany continues his sea journey. I hope all is well with you, my journey continues... He reaches Hiva-Oa, in the Marquesas Islands. I don't know how to describe it. It's splendid, magnificent. I'm in paradise. I'm sending you my latest images. I hope they'll be useful for your film. As for me, I'm heading for new horizons. He sends me these images for my film about the final days of Gauguin, the painter who went to live in paradise, the painter who worked on dreams. For my part, I'm doing portraits of young women that Gauguin might have painted. It was on Hiva-Oa that Gauguin spent the final years of his life. It has been 8 years since he left Europe, where his reputation as "island painter" is now established. But Gauguin begins to feel lonely. He is tired and ill and can think of only one thing: returning to France, leaving this paradise that has become a hell. He writes to his friends back home but they all advise him not to come home. One of them writes: "You are now a great artist, a legend, who, from the depths of Oceania, sends back unparalleled works by a great man who has, so to speak, disappeared from the world. You must not come back." But Gauguin insists. He even proposes to come back to Europe and hide. Perhaps he could live in Barcelona and send his paintings to France from there. He is told he will be found out and ridiculed. So, prisoner to the dreams of others, he stays as his health gradually deteriorates. When he died, his final painting was found, a Brittany village under the snow. A few days later, the painting was sold in an auction, upside down, with the title: View of Niagara Falls. My daughter Lola, in India, at the time of our great journeys. She could play the beautiful Draupadi in the film I want to make. I dream of making a film telling the Mahabharata, the whole story of the Mahabharata, the longest story ever written. The Mahabharata is a story told by a hermit to a child when they meet in the mythical world of Ancient India. As the elephant Ganesh was there, he broke off one of his tusks and wrote the story, that's how we know it. Here, I show only the beginning and the end, and you must imagine everything that happens in between. In the beginning, there's a face-off between Yudhishtira, eldest of the five Pandavas brothers, the goodies, and Shakuni, uncle of the hundred bad Kauravas, who want to conquer the universe. Yudhishtira has but one fault, he likes to gamble and he's about to bet his family his wife, his brothers, his palace and the whole universe. Shakuni, sitting opposite, is a professional cheat. This all takes place under the eyes of the beautiful Draupadi, Yudhishtira's wife, perhaps the main stake of the game. Let's play! But promise you won't cheat. Not cheat? You ask a professional gambler, not to cheat? Would you ask the most beautiful woman to make herself ugly so as not to hurt others' feelings? Would you silence an intelligent man so as not to offend the idiots? Yudhishtira, life isn't like that. Then let's play! Thus began the epic tale of the Mahabharata, the terrible war during which Yudhishtira and his brothers had to win back the universe. And this is the end. Only Yudhishtira remains, and he climbs the Himalayas to get to heaven. But it is so cold that he would have died if a dog had not come and warmed him up. Have I arrived? - Yes, Yudhishtira. You have arrived at last. You have finally reached the gates of heaven. Your mother, your brothers, your wife, Drapaudi, are all waiting for you. Come, Yudhishtira, follow me. No, Yudhishtira, you may enter paradise, but not the dog. - If the dog doesn't come, neither do I! Here you are at last You, for whom I have been waiting So long Jewel of my heart The doors of heaven are open They are the doors of happiness The doors of heaven are open They are the doors of happiness For eternal happiness awaits us Come, my love Come, my love Come, my love Come, my love In heaven the river of endless happiness flows Leave the dog and come join us, my love Come, my love Come, my love Leave him Leave him Leave him You will see what happens to the dog and everything that happens between the beginning and the end the day the film is finished. I dream of filming a romantic epic, a tragic love story like that of John Nicol. Here is the story. In July 1789, a ship of the royal fleet leaves the port of London carrying 245 women and bound for Australia. Cook has just discovered the continent and the fleshly needs of the settlers must be met and the new colony populated. Mainly thieves and prostitutes, the government had taken them out of prison to deport them to Australia. Among them is a young girl of 18, Sarah Whitelam. The crew, led by His Majesty's officers, counts all sorts of sailors including a 34-year old Scotsman, John Nicol. They hug the coast of Africa and cross the Indian Ocean on a voyage that will last 10 months. John Nicol falls madly in love with Sarah Whitelam, and their love grows stronger over the journey. Sarah is one of the 50 women to give birth during the voyage. On arriving in Australia, John Nicol has to leave Sarah and return to England, according to the terms of his contract. He swears he will return as soon as he can, and sails away. Years pass before he returns. But when he does, Sarah is no longer there. He makes enquiries and discovers she has left on a ship heading for Bombay. What no one dares tell him, and what he would never find out, is that she is married to a settler, mother of two children. John Nicol leaves for Bombay and searches everywhere for her. He searches in the countryside, he searches in the city, but finds her nowhere. He looks for her all over, but finds nothing. So he leaves and travels to all the ports in the world. Cape Town, Buenos Aires, London, Rio de Janeiro, Santa Cruz, Batavia, Zanzibar, Bombay, Sidney, Canton, Macau, Tangier, Lisbon, Recife, Salvador de Bahia, Havana, Valparaiso, Bilbao and Port-Louis, La Rochelle and Porto Ribeira... For over 25 years, John Nicol travelled the world going all the way round, twice. He landed on six continents, fought with pirates and Napoleon's fleet, made friends in China, Jamaica and Hawaii. But he never found Sarah Whitelam. At the beginning of the 19th century, exhausted, he returned home, to Scotland. He wrote: "By then I was too old to look for her further, and I didn't know where in the world she was, or even if she was still alive." For in 1822, a publisher in Edinburgh asked to publish his memoirs. Having no money to live on, John Nicol accepted. But he was old now, and had forgotten the dates and places of his journeys. All he now remembered was the name of the woman he had loved all his life, Sarah Whitelam. Victor Hugo used to come here. It's one of the places where he liked to write. But when you go back over the writer's path, it becomes clear that the dates and places of his manuscripts do not always correspond to reality. Many of his texts served him as an alibi to be elsewhere, a place where he met his love dreams. One of these loves, the strongest, was Juliette Drouet. A young orphan, fresh from the convent, and turned actress. She met Victor Hugo and they became lovers. She left everything for him, following him like a shadow for 50 years. Over the years, she wrote him over 20,000 love letters. There are so many images, everywhere. So many images of the other, the elsewhere, that you think: "Why go out anymore, out there, into the landscapes, the horizons we've already seen, already shown?" Might as well stay home, with oneself and imagine the other, the elsewhere, and tell stories. For though there are too many images, points of view are lacking, and there are still stories to be told. I'd like to film the story, or rather the journey, of Lobera, a Spanish aristocrat from the 13th century. He vowed to go to Jerusalem with the fourth crusade. But, after much thought, the length of the journey and his fear of the Saracens made him change his mind. He then undertook, on his estate, a long imaginary journey. For over a year, he toured his estate four times a day until he had covered the same distance as that between his castle and Jerusalem. In the 18th century, Bougainville also leaves on a trip around the world. A certain Commerson is chosen as naturalist for the expedition and boards ship with his young domestic, Jean Baret, who is in fact his servant and mistress, Jeanne Baret. Women are not allowed on board His Majesty's ships and Jeanne is disguised as a man. She manages to fool the crew for over a year. They reach the coasts of Brazil, hug the coast of South America and enter the Pacific Ocean. They arrive in Polynesia and Bougainville is in seventh heaven. But as they disembark, the naked natives rush towards Jeanne Bare! Shouting: “ A woman, a woman!“ and start to undress her. Unmasked, Bougainville questions her and she lies to protect her lover, saying that Commerson is aware of nothing. Generously, Bougainville drops them off on Mauritius on the home journey to avoid them being punished. Commerson lived another 5 years, before falling ill and dying, but not before he named a flower after his young mistress: the Baretia. Later, Jeanne married a French soldier and returned to Europe with him, thus ending her trip around the world. Of Jeanne Baret, the first woman to sail around the world, there is not a single image. Unless it be the image of a flower. Today, the immensity of space leads to other journeys, ever further. And we look at the universe like the frogs watch the cabin, with the same curiosity. And we send out signals. The space probe Voyager has long since left our galaxy. It will outlast the solar system and all life on earth. It carries sounds, voices, music from our planet. Worlds appear and disappear... This is the last moment of the Ubykh language. This man from Anatolia is dead and with him died the Ubykh language, which he was the last to speak. The last sounds of this strange language were a set of lies. "For," he said, "There are no words without lies." The police have just arrested a cinema student who was prostituting herself to pay for her studies. Under the streetlamp, she was reading Kant. She told them the parable of the pigeon. "When the pigeon flies, it struggles against the resistance of the air, and imagines it would be easier to fly in empty space. But if it flew in empty space, it would fall. In order not to fall, one must learn to resist," she told them. It would be the tale of a young filmmaker, just starting out. He wants to film rebellion, resistance, rejection of the world the way it is. First, he writes a script and gets together a big team. There's music and professional actors. Ready? Action! It could be the tale of this young woman, in England, in the fifties. Maybe she's a spy. She could be a Russian spy, supporting the revolutionary cause. Or an Indian terrorist, fighting for her country's independence. But something's wrong, it's all too heavy. So he writes a simpler fiction and films it near home. The actress is the same, now a Maoist militant in the sixties, but the mother and father are not professional actors. Careful, silence, we're filming. But something's wrong, because reality doesn't follow his script. So, he stops writing and plunges his actress into the social fringe of the eighties. OK for the sound. But something is still wrong, is not synchronous with reality. So he drops the whole team and makes portraits of the rebels, the marginals of his time. But he still feels that something is wrong. He feels the gap between them and him, and realizes it's just an image. So, he sets off alone realizing he must stop expressing his rebellion through others' eyes. He starts to film the world: water, stones, clouds. Yes, that's how it could end: he films the clouds, over and over... Then he understands that he simply has to watch them, that he must stop wanting to reproduce the world... Is this OK? - Yes, that's fine. Look at me. I'd like to film all the places all the things in the world called "I don't know' or "I don't understand" because of the surprising encounters between travellers and natives. When Captain Cook arrived in Australia, he pointed to an animal and asked what it was called. The aborigine answered: "I don't understand": kangourou. Cook actually died due to a misunderstanding in Hawaii. The natives, thinking he was a god, ate him and were awaiting his return. When Cook's companions explained that he was human, that he was now dead and would not return, the natives apologized and gave back the bits they had not eaten. My story box is a reservoir of dream films. An Italian woman in a hospital in Lugo, Italy, who fell into a deep coma six months ago, a few weeks after falling pregnant, shed a tear on Thursday as she gave birth to her baby. All these amazing stories come from everyday life. Like the one of the old Polish lady whose portrait I'd like to do. She's 113 years old. When asked what it was like to be so old she said she was afraid she might never die. So I raise my glass to those who are dead, the ancestors, to you, Jean Rouch, who I often saw make this gesture of offering, a salute to the ancestors. To you, who watched the dancing Dogon masks that you brought over to Paris, the masks from the cliffs of Bandiagara that Germaine Dieterlen had taught you about. Hail to the ancestors, to those who are drunk with adventure, to those for whom drunkenness represents the disorder at the origin of the world, for the souls of the dead are thirsty, as you used to say, Jean. Rouch, who filmed the Dogons for years, often spoke to me of the Bandiagara cliffs where they live. He spoke of it as a mythical, magical place, an apparition in a Chirico landscape. But since Rouch, so many others have been there, so many other images of these cliffs have been made, that I wanted to dream my own. There was... There was a dream... There was the dream of a film with Jan. Jan was a mechanic and a musician. I remember filming him one evening. My name is Jan and I like mechanics. Could you move closer to the light? - Yes. Could you move your face closer to the light. OK. The film never got made because Jan left for Africa, to do aid work. Months later, I received a letter from him, on December 6th, a letter from Africa, on Saint Nicolas Day. I read Jan's words and watched what I had just filmed. I got lost between here and there, between my images and what I was reading. Jan wrote about their inability to contain a starving crowd. He described the disorder, the pushing, the crush to grab some food, to survive. Then he said that he and the others on the mission went back to their camp, shocked at what they had seen. Then he, like the others, broke down and cried. He wrote: "A|| the men break down and cry. But the women hold up." He told me how fascinated he was by their resistance. Between the beginning and the end of the Mahabharata, right in the middle of the tale, there is a pond, a magic pond, and if Yudhishtira wants to pass, he must answer these questions: What is swifter than the wind? Thought. Give me an example of sorrow. Ignorance. An example of defeat. Victory. Which is the most cunning animal? The one man has not yet managed to know. What causes the world? Love. What is your opposite? Myself. What about rebellion? Why do men rebel? To find beauty, in life, or in death. What is inevitable for all of us? Happiness. Happiness is inevitable. Now tell me, what is the greatest marvel? The greatest marvel is that each day, death strikes all around us yet we live as if we were immortal. That is the greatest marvel. There's a film to be made about Bernard Moitessier. In 1968, the Golden Globe was organized, the first round-the-world race, solo and without stopovers. Moitessier was one of nine to take up the challenge. He left on his yacht with no help, no radio equipment, taking only a little tape recorder. After ten months of sailing, he was in the lead and was preparing to sail up the Atlantic towards England where the Golden Globe awaited him, along with a reward of 5000 sterling pounds and, naturally, fame. He would be the first sailor ever to sail single-handed around the world without stopovers. But, on April 18th, he catapulted a message onto the deck of a passing ship: "I am sailing on to the Pacific Islands, because I am happy at sea, and perhaps also, to save my soul." Turning his back on glory, he sailed on to Polynesia. I am truly happy at sea. You can't imagine how good I feel, alone, peaceful. It's not always easy, but when things go well, it's... It's fantastic, all the things I have felt. It's something that... So I don't want to stop now. It would be stupid to return to Europe. I was always on the go there. I could never live a whole month - what I call living - really living... Letting the sun inside you, finding a deep sense of peace. I never found that in France, I never did, not for a whole month. There were small joys, snatched from time to time. I cannot go back to France, truly, I cannot." Moitessier is the man who could have equalled Achilles' glory, but rejected it to become Ulysses, the traveller. By his death before the ramparts of Troy Achilles answered the question: "Why die?" But Ulysses, who sailed the seas, then returned to his family, only to leave again, was seeking the answer to the question: "How to live?" There's a film I dream of making but which I never will, because I'll no longer be of this world. One day, after 2060, the world population will stop growing and start to decrease. I would like to film the headlines announcing this unique news in the history of humanity. And I would like to film the slow disruption it would cause to man's relationship with the world, with animals, with himself. It's winter. The dog is sleeping. Far from everything and everyone, the film hibernates. I listen to the radio and I travel... A moment of the world... To sit alone at a terrace and watch the world. For years, when I saw a pile of ashes, I imagined lovers, awaiting their beloved, hour after hour, smoking one cigarette after another. Then one day, sitting at a terrace, I saw a car draw up and a door open... A moment of the world. Yes, I'd like to film a moment of the world. I'd watch the young women pass, and think of Baudelaire's poem, To a Passerby. Baudelaire is sitting there, at the terrace of a cafe, he is alone, drinking. Suddenly a woman passes and glances at him for a brief moment. In that instant, he knows he'll never see her again, that he knows nothing about her, that she is disappearing into the void. And his poem, addressed to her, ends with these words: "Oh you, whom I would have loved, Oh you, who knew it." I dream of filming the gaze of the women who pass. And I dream of filming friendly faces. And I dream of filming the vastness of the cosmos where, perhaps, all the souls of the universe meet. I dream of filming the face of an old lady and finding there the infancy of the world. And I dream of filming the desire of children. And I dream of filming the desire of lovers. And I dream of filming desire... I dream that it's summer, that I offer Jean-Marie a small role in a dream film. It would be the film of a man who, all his life, had done but one thing: portraits of his dog. But some dream films are impossible to make. For years, the same photo appeared in the obituaries of a daily paper. Every 27th of September, the photo of lmgard and the words: 1982 - 1989 Already 7 years Always close to you, Uncle. But some films must be kept silent, some films will never be made, some films are impossible to make. Jean-Marie fell, then entered a coma... His heart, as big as a house, beat on for a long while. Then he left. Jean-Marie's story, like Ulysses' story, like all stories, tells us: we cannot live without dreams, without lies, without illusions. A film by Eric Pauwels Subtitling: Tongues Untied
