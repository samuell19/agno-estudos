I told you, if you keep falling asleep, they're gonna kick you out of here. Um, sorry. Won't happen again, okay? Okay. Nancy. -Hey, Kris. You can sit wherever you want. -Actually, l'm just here to meet Dean. -Oh, he's right over there. Thanks. Hey. Wow, you look like you haven't-- Like I haven't slept in three days? Dean, what's going on? So, what are we doing after this? Let me see if we can go to Ashley's or whatever. Then I don't know. Look out, here comes your girlfriend. -Oh, hey. -Hi. Can I get you guys anything else? Uh.... Um.... No, I think we're good. We'll just get the check. ls that the only thing you wanna ask her, Quentin? Asshole. Hey. Why is Kris with Dean? Okay. Come on. That's fucked up. What was that all about? Um, Jesse's just-- He's pissed because Kris broke up with him. -I didn't even know they were together. -Yeah. I guess I can keep the change? Yeah. Look... ...I'm sorry about the mess. -These guys are just-- -I'm used to it. So you ever get tired of working here every weekend? Do you ever get tired of coming here every weekend? Quentin. You coming or no? Sorry. Look, this should take care of the rest of it. -See you around. -See you. Listen, maybe you should talk to somebody. I did. And he thinks all my problems come from my past. We began going through my childhood... ...and that's when they started. When what started? These nightmares. Nightmares. So, what, you can't sleep? I can sleep. I just don't want to. Okay, Dean, listen to me. They're just dreams. Okay? They're not real. These dreams... ...they're real. They're not. They're re -- I'm sorry, Kris. -No, it's okay. -Kris. No, no. It's fine. I'm gonna go clean myself off. It's okay. It's okay. You're not real. You're not real. You're not real! I am now. Dean, what are you doing? You're not real. -Dean, stop it. Dean. Dean, stop it! Dean! Tragedy can shake us at our core... ...and it can also unite us in our shared grief. Today we are gathered and united... ...for the tragic loss of a young man with so much life ahead of him. Let us pray. Lord, you who can turn the shadow of death... ...into the light of a new day... ...as we gather to commend Dean into your hands... ...help us to wait upon thee with penitent hearts... ...and remind us of he who died that we might live. --and the power and the glory - forever and ever. Amen. Amen. -Come on, sweetie. lt's over. Yeah. Let's go say hi. -Gwen. Hi, how are you? -Alan, hi. -lt's been a long time. -Yeah, yeah. -- Especially under these circumstances. - Yeah, not a.... You know, Nance, if you need someone to talk to.... I'm okay. Thank you. We're setting up a crisis center at the school. -- You know where my office is, right, Nancy? - Yeah. We're gonna head out. Take care. -Good to see you. Bye-bye, Quentin. You knew Dean that far back? Jesus, that is me. But I don't know how I'm in that picture. I didn't meet Dean until high school. Come on. -Dean said something right before he died. -Oh, please don't. He said, "You're not real." He kept repeating it over and over again. Do you have any idea what that means? No. I don't. Think about it. What would it mean? Dean was on a load of medication when-- Jesse. When it happened, it was like somebody was making him do it... ...but there was nobody there. Jesse, you have to believe me. Kris, it was late and you were scared. Your mind was just playing tricks on you... -...that's all. -I believe you. You do? I've seen.... -I saw-- -You didn't see anything. You weren't right there. Kris was. She's already fucked up, so leave her alone. You have no idea what I've seen. Let's go home. -Hi. -Hi. Hey, Mom, where are all the photos of me from when I was younger? -They're not here. -Oh, well, who knows? They're probably packed away over the garage. Why? Because today at the funeral I, um.... I saw a photo of Dean and I when we were, like, 5. But, you know, it's funny, l don't remember knowing Dean before high school. Who can remember being 5 years old? Hey, why don't you pack those up? Dinner's almost ready. Good night, honey. Remember me? Kris? You okay? What is that? Uh, nothing. Just, like, a sketch. Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm okay. -Yeah? Are you okay? Yeah, you know. You know, like, if you ever need somebody, if you ever wanna talk to somebody, l-- I'm sure you have like a thousand other people you could talk to... ...but if you wanna talk to somebody.... Thanks. Quentin. You're gonna be late to class. Come on, buddy, let's go. -My dad. -l know. Now, class, it was Pericles who told the Athenian people... ...they should all gather into the gates of the city... ...while his naval fleet picked off the Spartans by sea. Now, it was to be a slow but sure victory. The Spartans would never make it over the walls of the acropolis, Pericles said. But what he didn't take into account is that the plague would eventually strike. Open your books to page 84. To further complicate matters... ...the Spartans were armed with a variety of weapons... ...some of them even improvised. And they would not hesitate to slaughter every Athenian they saw... ...even children. Especially the children of soldiers. This is where the.... Wake up. Wake up, wake up, wake up. You really shouldn't fall asleep in class. Hi, Kris. -Who are you? You look just as beautiful... ...as ever. You have nothing to worry about. This won't hurt... ...one... ...little... ...bit. Are you okay, Miss Fowles? What happened? I'm sorry. What? Kris! Rufus. Rufus, what are you doing? Huh? What are you doing out here? Come on. Rufus. Come on. Hey. I have to fly to London on a redeye tonight. Okay. You gonna be okay? Yeah, l'm fine. I'm gonna be all right. Have a safe flight. I just worry about you. -Try and get some sleep. -Okay. I'll call you when l land. I love you. Love you. Jesus, Jesse. -What the hell are you doing here? -Are you gonna let me in? Yeah, come in. All right, l know l've been an asshole... ...and l've been jealous and l've been fucked up. But Dean was my friend too. Will you please tell me what's been going on? I'm having these dreams. And l'm scared. I think Dean was having them too. Kris, listen, we've all-- I know what you're gonna say. But now every time I dream... ...l always see this man. And he's.... He's burned... ...and melted. And he's always trying to... -...attack me with these knives-- -Knives on his fingers. What? Oh, my God. We're having the same dream. -Kris, it's not possible. -lt is possible. -lt's just a dream, all right? -lt's not a dream. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Oh, God. I'm so afraid. All I wanna do is go to sleep, but if l do he's gonna kill me like Dean. Maybe we should just stop talking about it, all right? We keep talking about it, we'll keep thinking about it, then we'll keep dreaming about it. Look at me. You'll stay with me? Of course I'll stay with you. Rufus! Rufus, get in here! Rufus! Ugh. Shit. Rufus. Rufus? Rufus, come here, boy! Come here. Ru-- Ru-- Rufus. Oh, my-- I was just petting him. Jess! Help! No! No! Help me, please! Help me! One, two Freddy's coming for you -Come on.

What the--? -Hey, hey. -What are you doing here? -Stop. Just listen to me, okay? -What happened to you? -Whose blood is that? ls it your blood? -Listen, okay? Please. -l was with Kris and-- -What'd you do to her? I didn't do anything, I'm trying to tell you. Listen to me, something's going on, okay? -Tell me what happened to Kris, Jesse. -Someone killed her in her sleep. What? -What are you talking about? -Don't pretend you don't know... ...because you do. You said it at the funeral. He's the one who's trying to kill us in our dreams. -All l keep hearing is the song. -What song? One, two Freddy's coming for you Freddy. -That's his name and he's in all of our heads. -No, that's impossible. No. Nancy. Shit. We gotta stop this. -How? -l don't know. Just don't fall asleep. If you die in your dreams, you die for real. Nancy? Who's in there? Oh, shit. Police. Don't move! Get down! Get down! -- l didn't do anything. - Down! Listen to me, l didn't do anything. Please. -- Get down! - Aah! I loved her, man! l couldn't kill her! What's going on down there? I didn't do anything! Stop! Shut up. -Get up. -l didn't kill her! You know! -- Shut the fuck up. That's a roger, two-two. Get up. - Call it in, code four. - - Get him out of here. Copy that, we've got a homicide. Code four. Homicide suspect in custody. Nancy! You know! You know who did it! Coming in. Open three. Clear. Clear four. -- Let him out. - All right. Hold five open. Open four. Hello? -Hi, it's Nancy. Hey. You said to call you if l needed to talk. -Yeah. -Kris is dead. Stay awake. -Stay awake. -Quiet. Shut the fuck up. That'll be $24.97. Five, four, three, two.... Five, six, seven.... Nightmares? Yeah. Freddy? Open four. Get up. Folks posted your bail. Jesse, help me. Help me, please. Kris? -Oh, God. -No. Just me. What do you want from me? Hmm. l don't know, Jesse. You think you can turn back time? -Answer me! -No. Do you think you can bring the dead back to life? -No. No! -No? I didn't fucking think so. No! No! No! Why are you screaming? I haven't even cut you yet. I didn't do it! I'm innocent! Get me out of here! Let me the fuck out of here! Did you know that after the heart stops beating... ...the brain keeps functioning for well over seven minutes? We got six more minutes to play. -You okay? -Yeah. I'm just really exhausted. Here. -What's that? -Zoneral. It's basically speed for kids with ADD. I've been on it since I was, like, 1 5. No. No. No, thanks. Nancy, look, you're running on fumes. Here, okay? Are you sure? It's-- Yeah, l'm fine for now. I didn't take you for the religious type. Yeah, well, you gotta believe in something, you know? What's this one doing here? It's The Pied Piper of Hamelin. I saw it in one of my dreams. It's about a guy who's betrayed by a town... ...and he gets his revenge by taking all their children. I keep dreaming about children too. And then there's also a school. Well, it's gotta mean something. Yeah, but, l mean, what? We didn't go to school together until, like, 6th grade. -Look, we're running out of time. -What do you mean? Nightmares are triggered by the belief that the dreamer has no control... ...and this can cause insomnia. But then it says at the 70-hour mark... ...the insomniac will begin to experience micronaps. "His brain will shut down its functions for seconds in an attempt to recharge." This basically means that you're dreaming, but you don't know it. Like, even if you're awake. And then it says that after that, your brain will shut down, inducing a coma. Which is permanent sleep. Nancy? Nancy. Yeah? Hey. Where have you been? I was at the bookstore. Okay, well, I didn't know where you were. And l just feel like, with everything that's been happening with your friends-- Hey, Mom? Do I have some sort of connection with Kris... ...and Dean and Jesse? Or Quentin? Like, maybe we went to school together when we were little or something like that? Not that l can recall. Did we ever know a guy named Freddy? I don't think so. Okay. Good night. Hey, it's Gwen. Nancy's starting to remember. Honey, you okay? Yeah, l'm fine, Mom. -All right. I'm going to bed. -Okay. Little Nancy. All grown up. You're just a nightmare. That's right. No one can prove I was ever here. Who are you? You don't remember? You must. You're my number one. You're my... ...little Nancy. I set an alarm. Yes, you did. In your dream. You smell different. Quentin? Nancy, he got to him. Jesse's dead. He died in his sleep. I saw him. -l fell asleep. l saw Freddy. -All right, I'm coming over. Okay. Shit. So Badham's a preschool. It's on the other end of town. It was closed years ago. Can't find any pictures. Wait, come here. I drew this after my dream. I don't know. l've never seen it before. How is the guy in our dreams connected to the school? I don't know. But l know my mom's hiding something. There's nothing here. Help me. What is that? We're all here. Kris, Jesse, Dean. It's me, it's you, it's-- What are you doing? Nancy, what is going on? -Give me the picture. -l don't understand. You said that.... You said that we didn't know each other. But we're all in this picture. We went to school together. Give me the picture. -lt's okay. -Why would you lie to me? -l didn't lie. -lt's right here. Why would you lie to me? -Stop lying. You're lying to me. -l'm not lying to you. -Stop lying to me! -l am not lying to you! I didn't want you to have to go through your life with this memory! I didn't want you to remember. I wanted you to forget! Remember what? What happened at that preschool? Smile, everybody. You guys look great. There was a man at the preschool. His name was Fred Krueger. One, two Freddy's coming for you Three, four Better lock your door He was a gardener. He lived in the basement of the preschool... ...and you kids were his life. Four... ...three... ...two... ...one. We didn't wanna believe it at first. Ready or not... You all were so innocent. ...here l come. And you, Nancy... What are you drawing? That is so good. ...you were his favorite of all. You know what? I got some other drawings. And they're, like, really bad drawings. Maybe you can help me fix them? And then we started to notice things.
