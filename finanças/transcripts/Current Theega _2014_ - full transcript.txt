This is his house. Why have you come here? I want to meet Mr. Shiva Rama Raju. He's inside. Please go in. - Okay. Greetings, ma'am. I have come to see sir. He's praying. Please sit down. Praise be to Lord Shiva, the God of Destruction. Lord Venkateshwara, Vinayaka, Saibaba and Goddess Durga. Praise be to all the Gods. Bless the people of this town. Greetings, sir. - Hello, Circle Inspector! What is the purpose of your visit? When your daughter eloped with her lover... When she went away with her lover village folks were claiming that you killed them, sir. The superintendent of police sent me in person to confirm if it was true. Yes, I killed them! We won't let you arrest him! His name is Shiva Rama Raju. He is a bigwig in Parvathipuram. He has no sons but 3 daughters. He regarded this gun as his eldest son. The gun is a symbol of his dignity. His moustache is his prestige. Why are you sneezing? Shall I call for a doctor? Fool! Why? Even that sneeze likes our boss. Isn't it? - May no one cast an evil eye on him. He sneezed beautifully! If we ordinary folks sneeze, it is considered inauspicious. He sneezing is a good omen. - Well said! These 4 are the orchestra of Mr. Shiva Rama Raju. They feel, even his sneeze sounds like maestro Ilaiyaraja's music. Shiva Rama Raju went hunting with his friends often. Shiva Rama Raju thought himself to be an expert at hunting. But until now he hasn't even shot a sparrow. His name is Veeraraju. He was an expert at deriding people skillfully. 17 years ago, these two fought. Give sweets to them also. Shiva Rama Raju has been blessed with a baby girl. Is that so? - Yes. Has Goddess Lakshmi been born as your daughter? Even when the first born is a girl everyone blames it on their fate. This is your third daughter and you're distributing sweets. Not just three... Even if I have two more girls, I'll distribute sweets all over again. Now you'll say so. Tomorrow when she grows up, falls in love and elopes then you'll know the true joy of it. Would you still then distribute sweets? Watch your words else I'll snip off your tongue. As if you're a celebrity! He's insulting you. Why are you quiet? He can just watch but can't do anything. You've chopped my boss' ear. How dare you chop my ear! If you insult me further, I'll slit your throat too. You're such a gentleman. Is this how you behave? I can behave like a gentleman if the other person behaves well. What will you do if your daughter elopes the way I predicted? Forget eloping, even if one of his daughters falls in love my boss will chop off both his ears. Otherwise, he will kill both of them. Are you okay with this bet? Okay! Same here. Mr. Shiva Rama Raju, are you fine? I'm on top of the world. Both my daughters are well settled. One son-in-law is a lawyer and the other is a police officer. If the third daughter marries a doctor law and order, and health will be under the same roof! All marriages won't happen as per your plan, Mr. Siva. Your third daughter is still single. Boys nowadays focus only on falling in love, nothing else. And they revel in it. ♪ Electric Wire. ♪ ♪ Electric Wire. ♪ ♪ Electric Wire. ♪ ♪ Electric Wire. ♪ Stop... Stop. Why did you stop? You belong to the neighboring village. You don't know him.

Constables, seize the vehicle. I told you not to provoke him. He'll make your life miserable. How will we now face our boss, Don Shankar? He is Don Shankar. Specializes in being a goon, murder and seizing lands. He's cruel and ruthless. Were you twiddling your thumbs when he seized the tractor? Raju from Parvathipuram complained, sir. How does that matter? Why didn't you slit his throat? Hey, Seenu! - Sir. It's trivial. Ignore it. Who is Raju? - He heads the VIP union. Raju! Dad... - What, son? You've become too lazy. Serve me food. Fast. I'm coming. Wait. Serve the gravy for the rice. Even though you are educated, you're jobless. When folks ask me what you are up to I don't even know what to say.

I might forget to be faithful to you! Isn't my 'sambar' tasty? If you make a gravy without adding any spices how will it be tasty or edible, dad? That's why I want you to find the right bride. I'm trying sincerely but I haven't been able to woo even one. Is she a fish on a bait or a soap to slip and fall down? I'm talking of a life partner.

Am I late for my bus? - At what time does the bus with your girl come? 8:30 a.m. - What's the time now? My girl comes in the bus at 9, I was here at 7:00 a.m. My bus comes at 9:30 but I came at dawn. Even if you spend the whole night, you'll never get a girl! Why did you come? - Just like that. When in love, you should have decoration. That's dedication, you idiot. Oh no! - No swearing. - Okay. Hey, my bus is coming. There she is. Ramzan greetings to It's been six months. - Same shot! I don't know about you, but I'm really bored. True. - I share the same feeling.

Eve-teasing is a common problem in colleges that girls face. Best is to find a good groom and get her married soon. Very true. Where's my daughter? My 2 sons-in-law. This is the suitor who is here to see Kavitha. I'll be back. Keep talking. Okay. Look! Here she is. - Yes. Looks like a newly built hi-tech city building. It's a 'yes' from my end.

Does she know about the formal meeting? Doubtful! - Doubt? This is an insult to the software industry. Why is everybody so excited and flustered? That man's who's here to see you is a suitor.

None of you need to talk on my behalf. I'll handle it myself. Kavitha! Mr. Shiva Rama Raju's third daughter is engaged to be married to Venkataraju's eldest son Prakashraj, as decided by the elders. May they be happy. Give me tea. Shiva Rama Raju's third daughter, Kavitha, weds Prakashraj on 3rd February, 2014. Minister, look at that. She looks familiar. She's my courier girl, Kavitha! They are getting a student married. If we keep quiet and not protest they will resort to child marriage tomorrow! When situation demands, we shouldn't postpone our entry. Start your bullet bike! - Give me the keys. Let's go. - Yes. Style! Okay. Let's go. Yes, sir. No 'sir' is around. Only we are here. I meant only you both, sir. She meant, us. What's happening in our town nowadays? When girls should be carrying books they are forced to marry and carry babies! Even if our society turns a blind eye to it our VIP union will be vocal about it. Your law specifies that girls should marry only after they are 18. But in Mr. Sivarama's daughter's case your law has its eyes blindfolded! Why? - He's a VIP. If they sport a big moustache and roll their dilated eyes they don't become VIPs. Cool, boss. Leave it. To be cool, this isn't Ooty. It's my duty. Don't use fancy words just to rhyme for effect. It defines my heartache. As soon as a girl is 12, so many do's and don'ts for her. Don't talk to boys, or look at them. Learn to cook and do household chores. Pray to God every day. Don't step out after 6:00 p.m. Don't watch TV after 9:00 p.m. Don't use the cell phone and talk to anyone. Don't show your face on Facebook. Even if married at 17, don't talk back to elders. How unfair is this? Is it justice, ma'am? Raju, soda. Thanks. Sir... I'll come to the point. Will you stop the wedding of Mr. Shiva Rama Raju's daughter? Or shall I report it to the commissioner? Come on, tell me. Kavitha Welcome. Don't falter in serving the guests. Okay. This event should be imprinted deep in every guest's memory. Yes, you bet! Mr. Veeraraju!

But the goat itself! Shut up! - Serve me 'sambar'. If you shout too much, I'll snip off your tail. As it is, we are tensed about the arrival of the police. And you are adding to our stress. If you serve us vegetarian food do you expect politicians instead of cops to be your guests? Just serve them diluted buttermilk. Not wrong. But it is a mistake.

Sub inspector, since you're here bless the couple and have dinner before you leave. Your daughter is a minor. That's the major problem. If two lovers elope and come to your station you'll get them married. Same is the case in a Registrar's office. But doesn't a father have that same right over his own daughter? Sir, your daughter is only 17 years old. If she's married at 17, it is a bad decision. But if it happens when she's 25, it's approved? I'll wait for 10 years. Will you fix a good alliance? Tell me.

Have you sprained your back, sir? - No way. You'll never catch him spraining his back. He's an iron man! Start, sir. Just like all the previous years, this year also, we should conduct this festival in a grand manner. If every family contributes their share, we'll take care of the remaining expenses. Decorating the idol, chariot procession special prayers, devotional songs spiritual lectures, stories of mythology. Everything will be scheduled like we do every year, okay? This is more than enough for our people. Go. Wait! How can you suggest and accept your ideas? Shouldn't you know what the youngsters think? Youth? Who else is more youthful than us? ♪ Let me check! We are... VIP! ♪ ♪ Here we go! ♪ ♪ VIP! Here we go! ♪ If this town is the jungle, our sir is the... - Lion. If it comes to hunting, sir is... - A tiger! If it's a race sir is... - A horse.

To watch such a performance, we have to go from village to village. If you don't organize Rita's record dance this year I have no option other than leaving this home town of mine. Raju! Our town without you will be like a temple without a God. God-less temple! - How's it possible? Stop it! Tell us what you want. If people can enjoy watching a film for 2 hours is it wrong to wish for entertainment in our temple festival for 3 days? Am I asking Rita to take her home with me? No. Never! For that elderly gentleman... For that little boy... For that old man... Along with all religious talks and stories, Rita should dance to sexy siren Silk Smitha's songs.

Hello. - Go inside, dear. You've come home... Take it. - Why all this, sir? In my entire lifetime I'll never forget the favor you did for me the other day. What did I do, sir? My daughter has aced her studies. - Really! If you hadn't stopped the wedding that day I wouldn't be so happy today! Sir, your daughter is 18 and a major now. You can get her married to the man of her choice. Thanks a lot. - Please don't thank me. Thank Raju. Raju! - Raju? Our... - Who one else but the president of the youth VIP union. That boy! Yes, that boy. He has been doing some good deeds in our society. This is one of them. That's good. Okay, sir. Sir, we should beat him to a pulp right away. Yes, sir. Raju! Meow! Heart attack! I mean love. - Okay. What? Siva sir, the rat is acting up in front of the elephant. We must snip its tail off! One look at him, my temper reaches boiling point, sir. Caught him! Sir, I love you. It means, I love you. Ma'am, do you love me? Hey! It has been proclaimed that we should love all beings. By Allah, Jesus, Vishnu... Even Mahatma Gandhi has spread the same message. It is the agenda of our VIP union to spread this message of love. I'll go. You continue. Hey, Mr. Veeraraju! You should also follow this instead of chopping ears. I love you. You love me. Okay! I love you, sir. Thank God! We escaped. Great escape, dude. Let's leave from here. He wants us to love all. You thought that he was in love with your daughter. Raju who complained and stopped my daughter's wedding shouldn't be sitting on a bike. He should be sitting in a wheel chair! ♪ Electric Wire. ♪ Go forward. Why should you be scared and reverse? I was scared of fighting with him. So I didn't move. We shouldn't get scared. We should scare them. I'll teach Raju to be scared of death! Just watch. He'll call me. Meow! Why are you in my area? To see me? No, for Kishore's sake. - Oh no! Shall I try my luck? Okay, I'll support you. Uncle, give me 2 chocolate bars. Isn't this design beautiful? Lovely. - Nice. Take this. It's really beautiful. No need. Brushing my male ego aside, I must tell you I've fallen in love with you. I haven't. If not today, for sure you'll fall for me someday. You don't have any other option. Why? Because I saw your mole which no one else has seen! Where? I won't tell you. - Tell me, please tell me. I'll tell you after we get married. Marriage? All the best. Thanks. - Thanks to you too. Raju, my prince. Please come. You love Raju, don't you? Why don't you tell him then? I will. When I know that he'll do anything for our love, I'll tell him. If you poke your nose in matters that don't concern you you'll lose your head. Sir, people claim if I hit, it will be a total knock out! I'm warning you for your own good. If you apologize for what you did, you can leave without a scratch. I'll ignore your misdeeds. What if I don't? Who is hitting one of our men? Stop! Who is that? Isn't it Chandra's son? Yes, it's him. - Lift... Lift him. What happened? What happened, sir? I heard that your son is as powerful as an electric wire. But the shock treatment went to your son instead of the person it was intended for. Chandra, what's right for your son seems wrong for the opponent. He interferes unnecessarily. What if they kill him? I can't come every time like Lord Krishna and save him, right? Between 2 men, there is a line. As long as the line isn't crossed, there won't be any problem. Even Goddess Sita couldn't avert disaster when she crossed that line. What are you? Be careful. Why are you advising him? You should have killed him straight away. We had him beaten up. We warned him also. If he still doesn't listen we'll have to resort to what you say. There's a time for that too. Who instigated this? This big shot who left just now. What are you saying?! He was getting his minor daughter married. I complained to the police and stopped the wedding. So he got me thrashed. - You called him a big shot! He's a narrow minded man. Why are you hesitating? Just go and kill him. How to jump this high wall? It's me. No one saw us. Oh, God! Lord Vinayaka, how are you? Shiva Rama Raju's life is on that wall. Catch! Oh! It didn't fall. Can't see his moustache. I'll flash the light on him. Shoot him now. Oh! He's waking up. If he had woken up, we'd be dead meat. Trickster! You refused and then used the same henna design. Naughty girl! Shall I kiss you or not? My property, right? Good God! Okay, do this. I've never seen anything like this in person before. I'll switch on the light. Carry on. Sorry. Wait for me. Parvathy... Parvathy? What, dear? - Where's my gun? How will I know? It was on the wall last night but is missing in the morning! Kavitha... Kavitha? What, father? - Did you see my gun? I did. 'Thuppakki' is Tamil film that is dubbed. It's a very good film. What happened? - His gun is missing. Gone? Where is my gun? What will I do without my gun? Someone has stolen it... Why worry about a rusty old gun? Forget it. Your brain is rusted. How dare you deride my gun! No one is bothered about my gun. Wonder whose hands my poor child is stuck in? And what suffering it is going through! Bravo! Shoot below now. My gun is missing, why should this picture be hanging here? Don't break it. Do you love me so much? No, dear. I just now swept the house clean. Fate! - Sir... Sir? Even if our best friend puts the towel on his head instead of his shoulders he has such a distinct style! Not only that, the whole town will now imitate this style. Delicious smell of mutton curry is giving me hunger pangs. Did you go hunting without us by any chance? Oh no. Here I am mourning the loss of my gun and you talk about hunting! Your gun is missing? What? Your son has been kidnapped? Someone has stolen my gun to strip me of my dignity. Don't worry, sir. It is our duty to retrieve your gun within 24 hours. Let's go. Shiva Rama Raju must be in a state of shock now. He must be scared out of his wits! I'm telling you to learn this art but you're turning a deaf ear! It seems that I should learn his art of foretelling with cowrie shells. Go, roll the shells! Hey! Sambaiyaa! Good afternoon, sir. What can I do for you? Mr. Shiva Rama Raju's gun is missing from his house. We want you to foresee with your cowrie shells. Oracle of the cowrie shells... Goddess, show us the way. 1+1=2 2+2=4 Naturally! As if 2+2 can be 14? Tell us who the thief is. There were 2 of them. Looks like your father will point his finger at us! He will toe the line in his first ball with full line and length. Then the rest will be all wide. 2+3=5 3+6=9 The thief has been caught. Who is he? - If I should tell you then you must satisfy the cowry-king! Okay, fine. Tell me. - 25 kilos of rice, 5 kilos of lentils. One country chicken. We'll give you a full bottle of rum. That too. - We'll give all of that. Tell us who the thief is. Your father may bowl a full toss at us! Don't worry. Last ball will be a no ball for sure. ♪ Full toss... ♪ The thief has a mole, the size of a cowrie shell on his right hand. Got him. Let's go search. Whoever has a mole on his right hand we'll chop his hand and bring him over. Let's go. - Let's go. Are you my father or a sadist? - What happened? Look! The mark you identified for the thief is on my hand. - Oh no. No wonder it was so familiar. I didn't remember that it as yours. Why me? Don't worry. I'll handle it. Hey, Chittibabu! - Yes. - Please wait. Even my son has a mole on his right hand. Don't think that he is the thief and chop his hands off. Tell me. - I don't know. I don't know. - Where's the gun? Don't act. We'll skin you alive. - Mr. Shivaraman! My hands are tied I can't even plead with you. You should be magnanimous and understand my plight. I don't know. It hurts. - Then who knows if you don't? Dhanaraj knows. I don't know. Dhanaraj? Drag Dhanaraj here. Who told you that I stole the gun? Drunkard Ramesh! - Is he some big shot CBI officer? Why did you tell my name? I said that you have a high IQ. Is that wrong? Beat him up. - Beat him to a pulp. Don't beat me up. You? Why did you take the gun? Revenge. Why? - Your father hit this boy. Why did my father hit you? After I stopped your wedding, as if he'll offer me fruit salad? Sorry. - Okay. Please return the gun to my father. He has been crying like a small kid for the past 2 days! He thinks of this gun as his eldest son. Hello, sister-in-law! Please tell your sister to express her love for me. Give me the gun first. Say 'I love you'. - I won't. Tell me. - Please! I want to hear you say 'I love you'. - Please. I won't. ♪ O girl, ... ♪ ♪ O girl, ... ♪ What did you especially install into girls, God? However strong a man is, one gesture and he falls flat! The Gods must be crazy! The gun has been found. Stop hitting me. He got his gun. My gun is back. My dear 'son'! Untie me now. As if you were even tied for us to untie you now! Drunkard! You found the gun? - Yes. Where was it? In the kitchen, dad. How can the gun that was on the wall be in the kitchen? Perfect point, sir - Yes. I'll tell you. Come closer. Bend a little. Yes, you're right The gun has been found. You all can leave now. Let's go. - My gun is like my son! Hey, who's getting married? Your girl's friend, Vanaja. Meow! If she doesn't fall for me, that's the end of my life. You can't live even if she loves you. - Why? Don't you know about her father's bet? He has to chop both his ears if his daughter falls in love. Let him chop his ears or any other part he wants. She is mine I swear on his ears! Alright... Let's go. What are you looking at? Get in. We must check out the groom. Excuse me. Thank you.

Eat to your stomach's content. Is just a groom enough to get married, dad? Shouldn't her dad check if she loves the groom or not? Girls who take ages to decide how to fall in love ditch their lover in split seconds. Why is that so, dad? If some chap did lament about love failure I used to smile at his stupidity. Only when the shoe pinches do we feel the pain! Now I know. I don't know whether I'll die if I don't marry her. But I know I won't be in my normal senses. Why is it that people I love leave me and go away, dad? My mother passed away when I was a kid. Now the girl I love has left me. From this day onwards I don't like you, dad. I don't like you, dad. A man who has lost his mother when young will cherish his wife like a princess. It's her loss not yours. Why are you crying? You shouldn't be crying.

Hi! - Sadist! What's your name? Jesudas Paul. Your name is worse than your songs! What's your name, ma'am? Melody Ambrosia. Not ambrosia. This is poison. I'm depressed as it is with my bride eloping and you happily sing a sad song. You won't pay us then? - You want payment? Veeraraju? - What, man? Shiva Rama Raju's daughter has eloped with Raju. You've won your bet. Don't.... - Move aside. Even if one of my daughters falls in love I shall either kill both of them or chop my ears off. Don't cry, baby. How long will it take for the train to arrive? Anytime now. Don't cry, my muffin. Don't cry. What happened, my princess? When that girl grows up if some chap like me elopes with her won't her parents feel terrible? Your parents must be feeling the same, right? What we are doing is wrong. Let's go. - My dad will kill you. Let's go. Raju! Don't.... Raju! It's obvious that she'll be angry if we hit her lover. They are both eloping. She is his fiancee. If I pinch her waist he'll go berserk. Watch this. He'll go bonkers. If I kiss his bride in front of his eyes.... Won't he get mad? I'm not angry. My mind has acquired clarity. You'll remember my blows till your heartbeat stops. Brother, don't. Why all this nonsense build up? Come! ♪ Electric Wire.... ♪ ♪ Electric Wire.... ♪ Come on. Let go of me. ♪ Electric Wire.... ♪ ♪ Electric Wire.... ♪ Raju! Raju? He isn't taking me away from you, dad. He's bringing me back to you. We realized our mistake so we are returning. When a dad finds out that his daughter is in love he usually threatens to kill her or himself. He doesn't check on the family background or character of the boy. He doesn't realize that what really matters is his daughter's happiness. How many parents do this, sir? Sir, if only parents give a tiny assurance that they won't obstruct the path of lovers, that's enough. No one will elope in this world, sir. It is your duty as a father to get your daughter happily married. But being in love with her, for me.... She is my life. We've understood your feelings. If you also understand what we feel for each other and get us married, we will be very happy, sir. Please! Hello! Driver, turn around. Go back. Move aside. Give way. Hi, sir. I'm here. He has tarnished my family's image. My ears! Why did you get me into this mess now? What's all this, sir? You said you killed him. He wanted to kill us. But is it that easy to kill one's daughter? Tell us what happened, sir. Uncle, tell us the remaining story. That night, they both walked towards me. Doesn't look like you will change, sir. I'll never show my face to you. See you. Hey! Stop. You'll take my daughter and then return her as you wish? You think only you can change! Won't we change? We can also change our opinions. What do I achieve by forcing her to marry a groom she dislike? So I thought, even if I lost my daughter should win. That's why I decided to help her elope. Not just that. I even propped up the ladder for her to jump over the wall! They were running away on the spur of the moment not knowing whether they had money. I took Rs. 1,00,000 and gave it to them. I was waiting for someone to raise the alarm that she was missing. She is missing. I pretended to take the gun out in anger, to kill you. But my actual intention was to bless you both. Even if you had known it or not I would've done the same. Now that I am here, let me prove that I mean it. Take this cash and elope from here. Why should we elope when you like me now? We can invite the whole town and get married in style. You can say that! I don't even fear God. But the very thought of Veeraraju makes me shiver. Is your wedding important for you, or my ears? Wedding.... - Ears are a priority for me. You both may sneak out now. I'll go back with a build up that I killed you both in a frenzy. For the sake of a wager Shiva Rama Raju killed his own daughter. May he live long! Veeraraju and everyone believed my story that I killed you. This is what happened. Oh God! He has fainted. Is there any hospital nearby? Good news for you, my dear father-in-law. Your daughter is expecting a baby. You will soon be a grandfather. All this is fine but will Veeraraju cut both my ears if he knows you are alive? Forgive me, Mr. Shiva Rama Raju. I ridiculed girls and provoked you unnecessarily. Do you know how upset I was thinking you killed your daughter?
