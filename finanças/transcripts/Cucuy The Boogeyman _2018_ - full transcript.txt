Kill, kill, kill! Die, die, die! Gotcha! Come on, come on! Mom, I thought you said 10 more minutes. That was 20 minutes ago. Upstairs. Now. I hate you. - And no playing on your phone! - Ugh! You never let me do anything! I'll talk to him. Gabriel... you know why it's important to listen to your mother, don't you? Because if you don't, the Cucuy will get you. The what? You mean your mother never told you about the Cucuy? Uh-uh. Ah. They say that he goes from house to house every night, looking for children who have misbehaved. And when he finds them, he hides, waiting till they're all alone. In fact, he could be here right now. Maybe he's hiding under your bed. Or maybe... he's in the closet. He comes out when you're sleeping. He puts you in his sack and takes you to his cave... where he eats you. What are you talking about in here? Oh, mijito and I were just talking about how important it is for children to listen to their parents. - Weren't we, mijito? - Yes. Yes. - Ready to go, Mama? - Yes. Do you have to go? Someone has to take your abuelita home. Don't worry, you'll be fine. Javi, we're leaving now. Javi? Javi! Man! You gotta stop believing that crap Grandma reads you. You jerk! Oh, that's too good. Oh, my God! Javi! Oh, this is priceless. Javi! Gabe? Javi, what are you doing? There's someone out there. Where? There was. Just leave me alone. Javi, what's going on? I'm scared! - Hide now! - Okay. Shh. Oh, my God! Javi? Javi? Javi! There she is. Gross. She can't even hear us. Smelly Melly. - Hey! - What's the matter? - You can't hear without this? - Give it back! Hey, can you hear this? Here. If you want this, you gotta catch us. Come on, let's go! Go! Stop! Please! Wait! Go, go, go! Crap. Move! Please! Later, loser! Adios! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Well, if it isn't the big sister. I told you, leave her alone! Sofie! It's not my fault she's a reject! Ooh! Stop! Hey, stop! - Stop resisting! - Come on! Didn't you see what they were doing to her? Let me go! What the hell is going on? I told him it was an accident! Your daughter assaulted a police officer. I was trying to protect Amelia, Mom. He just came up behind me. I didn't know it was a cop. Come with me, please. Take them down to my office. Be right there. Think you have problems, Sofia? Think about that poor family. There has to be something that you can do. She's your niece, for Christ's sakes! It's a felony, Rebecca. There are regulations to follow. Regulations? And this is how you do it? Sofia Alondra Martin. As your attorney has advised, this charge carries a minimum sentence of six months in a juvenile detention center. In light of your father's death and other extenuating circumstances, I'm sentencing you to six months of house arrest. You will wear an ankle monitor, and you will not be allowed to leave the premises without expressed permission. Ms. Martin, I strongly urge you to consider the leniency you've been shown here today. And I assure you, young lady, it will not happen again. Am I clear? Yes, Your Honor. This court is adjourned. You know that I'm picking up extra shifts at the hotel just to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table. All I asked was for a little help taking care of your sister. Sofe? I know things have been rough since your dad died. I just... I just need a little time to get us back on our feet, okay? Wow, I can't believe somebody actually rented that place. Mom! Christ. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Whoo! Amelia. Well. Guess St. Stephen's has the day off. Murphy, when did you get hot? What are you up to? Whoa. Amelia, what would you like for dinner? I thought Mom was coming home. She called. She has to work. But that's okay because we can do something special, just you and me. What do you say? Hey, is something wrong? You're lucky you don't have to go to school. Did something happen? Amelia! I don't even understand why they're bothering with a memorial. I mean, if Teresa actually had friends, she probably wouldn't have done it. Jesse just texted me. Okay, first of all, we've only kissed like once. No, he's not coming over. My parents are gonna be home in like an hour. I'm gonna call you back, all right? Okay, bye. 911 Emergency. There's someone in my house. Okay, miss, who's in your house? Please hurry. Are you safe in the house until the police arrive? Miss? Miss? Malo. Liberty Police have begun the search for 12-year-old Sierra Sullivan, who went missing following a frantic 911 phone call from her family home. At the scene, Sierra's mother has a plea for the kidnapper. Whoever has taken my little girl, if you're listening, please just bring her home. If anyone saw anything, and you're watching this, please call the police department and let them know. Already reeling from a suicide last year, the small-town junior high school is now desperately searching for the two students who have been abducted. Starting tonight, there will be a 7:00 curfew. Hey, guys, finish up. We're gonna be late. They didn't do all that for Javier. Those posts I saw online last night, that was her, wasn't it? What's he doing? Keeping someone down there? You scared the hell out of me! Are you, uh, watching that house? - I... - I get it. Creepy guy, creepy house. No, no, it's not what you think. Oh, so you weren't watching him. Let me show you something. Follow me. Is this really what the judge had in mind when he gave you house arrest? You don't think it's weird? Those two kids disappeared right around the time this guy moves in. You think he did it? Yeah, or he's involved. Because he bought chains? And lye. Well, maybe he's making soap. Okay. Have you been watching the whole neighborhood from in here? You ever watch me? No, no, of course not. I mean, not like specifically. You are such a liar. - Okay. - What have you seen? Like I said, I don't really make a habit of watching you. Uh-huh. How's your hand? It's-- It's fine. Remember back in fourth grade? Mm-hmm. In Ms. Fiorello's class. You got stung by that bee. First of all, it was a hornet. Second of all, it really hurt, so... Uh-oh. What? What? It looks infected. We're definitely gonna have to amputate. - Hey! - Where's that hacksaw? Shut up! You know, if you're gonna keep peeking through my window, the least I could do is, I don't know, text you when I'm doing something worth watching. Oh, how considerate. Put in your number. Are all the boys at St. Stephen's this chivalrous? Maybe when you get parole, you could come and find out. Cute. I am gonna need my phone back though. Right, of course. See you around. - I know. - You know what I mean. [chu You're one freaky gal, Sofia Martin. Sierra? Sierra! Sierra, where are you going? Screw it. I got three minutes. Okay, let's do this. Sierra. Um, I think you're confused. Get out of here. Get out of here. What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were under house arrest. I don't want any trouble. You don't want any trouble? You should've thought about that before you hit my boy with your car. Oh, you got an important date? Look, I just need to get back, okay? Please. Unfortunately, your uncle isn't bailing you out this time. Just back off! Oh, looks like your time is running out. Tick tock, bitch. Attention. Starting tonight, there is a curfew of 7 p.m. for all residents under the age of 18. All residents under the age of 18 are required to be back in their homes. Come on, we can get in the back. Again, 7 p.m. for all residents... Hey. - You guys remember her? - Remember her? Can't believe it's already been a year since she killed herself. Classic. Rest in peace. Someone there? What the hell? Hello? Guys, guys, we gotta go now! Guys, we gotta go right now! We gotta go! Dude, dude! We gotta go right now! - Dude, you're freaking me out. - There's something else here. I saw it downstairs. Please, we gotta go, please! Malo. No, please, no! No! No! No, no, no, no! Please, please, no! No! He's coming for you. As some of you might have already heard, last night, 16-year-old Travis Baines disappeared from the vicinity of Glimmer Peak Junior High School. Chief Martin, what are you doing to find these children? What are you doing to find my boy? And my daughter. How many children have to disappear before you realize we have a crisis? My son goes to school here! Is it true they all went to the same school? This have anything to do with Teresa Fuentes' suicide? Yeah, we wanna know what you're doing! Look, as of now, last night we instituted a curfew, which will be continuing for the foreseeable future. Does Glimmer Peak have a serial killer? It's still an ongoing case, so I'm not gonna discuss specifics at this time. Chief! What about the Cucuy? I'm sorry, the what? El Cucuy. Comes in the middle of the night. Take away youngsters that won't listen. Keeps them for a while, fattens them up, eats them, body and soul. You better get yourself a nice abuelita, Chief. Shut up! This is serious! Look, all I can say is of now that my department is doing everything we can to make sure these horrific events come to a close as quickly and safely as possible. Next question? - Si! - Over here! Then we split up for a little bit. George went upstairs. Travis went off, looking for stuff to take. What were you doing? I'm not gonna be charged with anything, right? I just wanna get an idea of what was going on inside the school. I was, um, tagging. Mostly lockers. You saw Travis again? Yeah, he came back. He looked kinda, you know, creeped out. And that's when you saw the kidnapper? Tell me about him. I don't know. It was this guy. So male. He was wearing this... this hood over his head, and he was carrying something. Like a bag. Did you get a look at his face? Not great. He had red eyes. Like... glowing. He's leaving. - Let me go. - No way. - You'll get in trouble. - I'll have three minutes. - That's not enough time. - Yes, it is. I'm gonna have one minute upstairs, a couple in the basement, and I'll come right back. I promise. Okay, this is our chance. - Hey, I got your call. - Come in, come in. Who needs small talk? Ah, so, we're still doing this, huh? Amelia's over there. You mean over there, over there? Yeah. You had your little sister break into the house of someone you think is a kidnapper? That's not exactly how it happened. Please tell me you at least made sure he's not home. Yeah, he drove away five minutes ago. Oh... You, of all people, should be familiar with the concept of law enforcement. I called you because I wanted your help, not a lecture. Well, maybe you should've called your uncle. You think I didn't? He practically hung up on me. There's something going on in there. I know it. I just need proof. Um, Sofie? What? No, no, no. He doesn't see her, does he? She's in the basement. Why isn't she moving? Oh, no. Can I help you? Yeah, hi, um... I-I was just wondering if... you've, uh, seen my cat. Wait, wait, wait! There was a map of the town. He put pins where all the kids went missing. He has photos of them. What are these articles about? Other missing kids. Jesus. I'm gonna call my uncle. We're gonna nail this nutbag. The Cucuy? Sofie? I've seen this. Yesterday, after you left, I saw this in the woods. Okay. But, uh, what's a coco? No, the Cucuy. My grandma told me about him once. It's this silly story parents tell their kids to frighten them into behaving. Look here. "The Cucuy is a mythical character, likened to the boogeyman, that is popular in many Latin and Central American countries. Stories about the Cucuy are often told by parents as a way to convince their unruly children to behave. According to the legend, the creature snatches naughty children in the middle of the night and takes them back to his cave to be eaten." Charming. "Countries all over the world have their own versions of the legend. The "Bag Man" in Armenia, "Bori Baba" or "Father Sack" in India, the "Krampus" in Germany. Where St. Nicholas would bring good children presents, the Krampus would take the bad children away." You don't think it's possible, do you? That it's real? I mean, think about it. Sierra and Travis were both bullies. Maybe this thing really is taking misbehaving children. Come on. How does one creature take all the bad kids in the world, huh? I mean, what's more believable? That some mythical boogeyman is out there kidnapping children, or that some psychopath in a Halloween costume wants to make you think it is? Hell, it's probably him. Yeah, yeah, you're right. Call your uncle. Show him the photos that Amelia took. At the very least, it's enough to get a search warrant. - No, I can't. - Why not? Because that would mean telling him that we broke into the guy's house. I'm on probation, remember? Okay, well, then tell him he left the door open or that you peered through a window. Yeah, yeah, that could work. But I really think we should keep this boogeyman thing to ourselves for the time being, okay? What boogeyman thing? Nothing, Mom. You know the rules. No boys allowed in the bedroom when I'm not here. Yeah. Oh, I should, uh, get going anyway, so... Are you sure? I brought Chinese. No, thanks, Mrs. Martin. Okay. Be careful. - Bye. - Bye. So I heard Teresa's memorial is coming up. I could take a day off, and we can go together. What do you think? Okay. Finish up. I need to get back to work, and I need you two working on your homework. "Don't worry, Mom. I'll do the dishes." Close your windows. There's a storm coming, okay? Amelia. Amelia! Amelia, are you okay? Sofie, Sofie! Amelia, what's going on? Amelia! Are you okay? No! No, not her! Please! Don't take her! No! Help me, Sofie, please. Help me. - I'm the one you want. - Sofie, please! If there's someone here who needs to be punished, it's me. I'm scared, Sofie. Help me. Leave her alone and take me! Malo. No, Sofie! Sofie, Sofie. Mom. Okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay, shh. What happened? Where is she? He took her. I tried to stop it, but I couldn't, Mom, I couldn't. He who? Did you see who did this? Sofie. Tell her what you told me, or I will. Sofie, Sofie, honey, if you saw anything, please, you have to tell us. Come on, Sofie. She said it was the Cucuy. - That's a made-up-- - I know what I saw. He had a cloak, just like in the pictures. Big sharp teeth and... red eyes. Red eyes. Wait, why? - It's nothing. - Why'd you say that? - Nothing. - Don't lie to me! Why? There was a kid at the school with the Baines boy. Before he got taken, he described something similar. Wait, so you knew about this, and you didn't do anything? Knew about what, the boogeyman? Look, I'm certain that she saw something, but I guarantee you, it wasn't some Mexican superstition. What does that have to do with anything? It's probably just a guy in a suit! There are four kids missing! My daughter, your niece! And the best that you can do is, it's just some guy in a suit? Look, I assure you, my entire staff is working on this. Are you sure about that? Sure it's not just some Mexican superstition? Sofia... do you have any idea who might have wanted to take your sister? Boyd Iverson! Police! Clear! Clear! Mr. Iverson? See if you can find the light. Gotcha, you son of a bitch. We got movement! What did he say? Did he tell you where she is? We're searching the house. We're seeing if we can tie him to any other active cases in the area, okay? We're gonna find her, Rebecca. Okay, in the meantime, I'm taking him downtown. Let's see what a few hours in the tank doesn't do for his memory. Hey, try and get some rest. Hey. Do you know who I am? My little girl? Well, her daddy passed away a year ago. Cancer. She had the privilege of watching her daddy waste away one pound at a time. And now she's out there alone, taken by God knows what, taken God knows where. So I am begging you, please. Please help me. Tell me about the Cucuy. What do you know about him? I know he's not real, and I know he's not out there kidnapping children. You're wrong. My brother had just turned nine when the Cucuy took him. We broke into an old warehouse. We were playing hide and seek. I found him just in time to see that son of a bitch throw him into his sack. I ran for help. No one believed me. I thought I could stop it from happening to anyone else. So I spent years tracking him, following him from town to town. When I read that story about the kid Javier and his brother, I knew. Someone here in this town had summoned him. So I found a place for rent and waited. Okay. Okay, let's just say that I believe you. - Where would he take her? - Rebecca! - Please. - You wanna save your daughter? Find the Cucuy's cave before it's too late. - You're done here. - Why would he go after her? She's never hurt anyone in her whole life. I said out! Now. Now! Stay away from my family. Funny, after all those years chasing you, I was wondering when you'd decide you had enough. You can't run from me forever, can you? You son of a bitch! You might silence me, but someday, somehow, you will lose. No fingerprints or DNA tie him to any of our crime scenes. Well, maybe he's not our guy. Then how do you explain the pictures, the articles, the maps in his basement? What about this Latin boogeyman character, the, um... Cuckooky? I've got four grieving families out there, desperately searching for their kids. I'm not gonna start indulging in some cultural fairy tale. Get a team in here immediately. Do it! I need backup. Do you remember anything about the Cucuy from when you were little? Sure. There were some silly things that my mother used to tell me about a... If you didn't do what you were told, the Cucuy would take you to his cave and eat you. That's a perfectly normal thing to tell a little girl, huh? Is that why you never told us the stories? Yeah. I mean, come on, isn't life cruel enough without the addition of monsters? But... - But its part of our heritage. - Sofie... Sometimes it's like you're embarrassed by it or something. - It's not that. - Then what is it? I mean, you never told us the stories, you never cook Mexican food, you never speak Spanish. Look, I just... I didn't wanna have to conform to someone else's preconceived notions about me. My entire life, people have been trying to put me into some kind of a box. Why? Because of the color of my skin? I don't fit into a box. And your dad didn't. And you and your sister certainly don't. So no, I didn't put much thought into a folk story that your abuelita told me. But what if those folk stories actually had some truth to them? Hmm? Now you sound like Boyd. Why? What are you saying? Mom! He said if you want to save Amelia, find the Cucuy's cave before it's too late. Is anyone there? Find the Cucuy's cave. I know you were looking, Boyd. Where is his cave? Where is he taking the children? It can't be that simple. Hey, what's going on? I think I figured out where he's taking them. But in order to find it, I'm gonna need to find him. And how are you planning on doing that? Someone had to have summoned him in the first place, right? I mean-- - Amelia's a good kid, right? - Okay. There's gotta be a reason he took her and not me. But here's what I don't get. What could a video geek, the most popular girl in school, a bully, and my sister possibly have in common? They... use Facebook. Murphy, I'm serious. Wait a second. Social media. Hey, it's all the rage. You should try it sometime. No, no. I think you might be on to something. A few days ago, I found out Sierra had been bullying her online. What if... What if the others are connected too? But what are we looking for? I have no idea. Puppies, panda bears... Not really much of a smoking gun, is it? There has to be something. Wait. That one. Isn't that... I'm so alone. I know I'm not perfect, but it feels like no matter what I do, how hard I try, how hard I work, I'm just not good enough. Not for my parents, not for my teachers, not for the other kids. And I just can't do it anymore. Javier, Sierra, Travis, they're all here. They actually said those things? You gotta go talk to her parents. Do they still have that place in town? Wait, why do I have to go? I'm on a leash. Let me take a look at that. Whoa. Super vintage. Check this out. Doesn't have anything good though. Hi. You scared me. Can I help you? Yeah, um... Actually, I was hoping to ask you a few questions. You're Amelia Martin's sister. You have our condolences. What can we do for you, Miss Martin? Look, I know what's happening. I know you had something to do with it. What are you talking about? The missing children. Javier, Sierra, Travis, my sister. I understand the pain that you and your family must be going through, but I really don't think this is the place-- I'm talking about the Cucuy! I'm confused. I thought they arrested a suspect, the one who killed himself. He was trying to stop him. Everybody who's been taken watched your daughter online. Do you expect me to believe that's just a coincidence? Hmm? Please, I just... I think there might be a chance to save those kids. But in order to do that... I need to know how to summon him. Please. We didn't do anything. Renate, you don't know anything about what happened with those children, do you? A few weeks after we lost Teresa, I... I started hearing rumors. And then one day, somebody sent me a video. They recorded it off the Internet. All those kids, they could've done something. They could've called the cops. They could've tried to talk her out of it. But they made of fun of her. They cheered her on. So you cursed them? The ones that watched the video? Did they really deserve to go on with their lives while our precious daughter was buried in the ground? So yes, I asked the Cucoy to take anyone, whoever watches that video. Jesus. It was just a story. I didn't want any of them to die. Can you save them? Yeah. Do you still have that copy of the video? We need to find someplace private. I don't want anyone else to get hurt. Yeah, I have just the place. This is Walsh. Can you get me the chief? Copy that, Walsh. Tell him it's about his niece. Stand by. Kieran, tell me that you have something. - Where is she? - Who? Sofia. She's down the hall with the boy from across the street. Do me a favor and go check. Okay. Sofie, your uncle's on the phone. Hey. You're gonna find your sister. All right. You don't have to watch this. Well... can't turn back now. I'm so alone. I know I'm not perfect, but it feels like no matter what I do, how hard I try, how hard I work, I'm just not good enough, and I just can't do it anymore. Oh, my God. She stepped in front of the car. Call 911! I hope you know what you're doing. He's here. I know you're here. I'm not afraid of you! Do you hear me? I'm not afraid of you! Hey. Malo. Now, Sofie. I'll see you on the other side, pendejo. Amelia? Are you down here? Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on! Hi. You've reached Sofia. Please leave a message. Hey, it's me. Just please call me, okay? Sierra? Amelia, no. No, no, no, no. Amelia, Amelia, no, no, no. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. Amelia, please wake up. Please wake up. Please wake up, Amelia. Please wake up. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. Sofie. Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? Shh. I'll piece a trail out, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go. out of here, okay? What about you? I can't leave them behind. When you get to the top, pull the rope up, okay? - No, I'm not leaving you. - Amelia, listen to me. I'll tell you when to lower it, okay? Go. Now. Come on! Leave my daughter alone! It's real. This is for Javier. This is for Sierra. This is for Travis. And this... is for my sister. We'd better go. Come on. Come on! This way, come on. Okay. - You go. - You go. Go, go. I'll see you there. I am so glad you girls are okay. Hey, listen, I'm gonna take time off work. I wanna be home more with my girls, okay? Kieran.
