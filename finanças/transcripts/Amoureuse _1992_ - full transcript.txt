Earlier at your place, I came too close. I wanted to talk about that, but I couldn't. I don't know why I walked to your bed. I felt stupid next to your bed. Your eyes on my back, I came back quickly close to you, but the harm was done. It's not a flat, it's rather a large studio. So at once you're in front of the bed, even if there's the curtain. You wanted to show you liked it. I was happy to see you and your place, but that was not a reason to act as if it were my place. You wanted to know how I live... how many live there. There might have been pictures of children... You're making fun of me, that's not nice. Do you really see me like an inquisitor? No, I don't know you well enough. So you decided to go to the restaurant right away. I could forget your name, but not my fright of seeing you judging me. Just stop the rambling. You don't leave my apartment, that's an obsession. Your fault. You don't want to talk about yourself. Do it and you'll see I can be the silent type, carefully listening. I was made to be awesome. I'm not kidding. So just being able to analyze myself a bit makes me crazy. I used to think all I was living was outstanding and all I was going to live and do, would always be exceptional. Now I'm feeling very ordinary. Sometimes I like it, other times I can't stand it. I like you to hold my hand but I don't want you to kiss me. I knew you weren't free. I didn't want to know it, but I got excited. As it's not often, it can go quickly, doesn't it? A little humour. And you've spent all day hanging around with me. When I met you, I was so happy, you can't imagine. That's all I wanted to say. Luck would have been for you to be between two love stories. Quite unlikely with a girl like you. It could have happened. I'm with someone I've known for 6 months. And before that it wasn't as I wanted. Not very often. Keep your hands to yourself. Keep your mouth and turn your head so I don't see your eyes anymore. That guy must be really great so that you've given up your extraordinary life. So he's the one who is outstanding, writing wonderful things. Yes, that must be it. There was one outstanding guy. Of course you met him. That's very discouraging. Extremely discouraging. We went for my birthday to the Mont St-Michel. Sounds dumb, but it was really good. And to talk about having a child. Why stop here, how about a child? I've always hated the Mont St Michel. I didn't know why. To the son! It's not for you to raise your glass to him. It's not for you to be happy about it. You can't be happy about anything. Who started that child thing? You're making it up so we don't have an affair, to depress me. When I was little I was crazy about Buddha. I was skinny but as I've always had a little belly my father's made nasty remarks about my belly. It made me love Buddha even more. I couldn't stand Christ in agony on the cross. It scared me. I can remember been caught by my father sticking out my tongue at a Christ hanging up in front of my bed. That was in a clinic where I had my appendix removed. It made him laugh. My father, not Christ. With this child, I can feel my head will be lighter. I'll put on some weight right in the middle, just like a Buddha. The head cuts you off from others. It makes them very small. Bullshit. Measure my head with your fingers from where you're sitting. See, according to you, I'm at least 3 times smaller. You're shrinking me. You cut heads. You take us as we are and presto, you shrink us. When I kissed you, then I had the right size. Not any more. I felt light tonight. It's been ages since I felt so light. Me too, I've been well. Anyway, I want to know who wants a child. Because it's not the same. You choose whatever suits you. He wants a child to keep you. Because he doesn't trust you. You like the idea because it shows that he wants to stay with you. It's amazing that you don't trust yourself at all. No, you want a child for him. He thinks it's a gesture of love. He's not against it, that's all. I don't feel that guy wants a child. For once I meet you, and you're really not funny. Look, I'm not angry with you. There's a very nice boy in my life, that's how it is. I'm not far away, I'll walk home. Right, now you can send me back, the hook through my mouth. Would it break your mouth to kiss me? Must be the reason you're not doing it. You should have tried to bite me. Other girls will remove the hook, I trust you. I didn't feel the hook. Actually you're just a seducer, but that I'd already guessed. You're empty, and won't be full any time soon, only your head is full. Undress me while you're at it! You're playing the girl, undressing, hiding in bed. That's how it goes. You're even prettier skinny like that. You've lost weight! You were already pretty, that's too much. That's not so good for tits, they disappear. I miss them. But nice tits, big ass. No big ass and nice tits. Make me a child, you'll have both. I want a child. I thought about it when you were away. I know you, you've just made it up to see how you'll piss me off with that. That's not true. I'll have a bath, are you coming with me? It's not of our age, I'm too young. Cut the crap. And my parents are zero, they won't be able to take care of it. No, really they ain't up to it. See with me, I came back from nowhere. Very funny. On TV I've seen a woman who had 3 loves in her life, and three children. But the children weren't from the 3 men she loved most. I'd rather have them with those I really loved. I've already missed one. Now regretting the children you hadn't wanted. Of course, I didn't know it would stop one day. I'd rather you miss another one with me. It gives me the illusion you've loved me almost as much as the other one. And it wouldn't be as good as you. It would look like me, it would be a disaster. I'm not kidding, I want a child with you. I'm serious about it. What's going on? I went away one week, we were 2, I'm back, we're almost 3. Can you explain? Two is not enough anymore? You're pregnant and that's your twisted way to announce it? I'm not pregnant. Are you relieved? Do you feel better? But thinking about it while I wasn't here, that's hard to believe. When did it happen? How does it happen? Perhaps even more last night. Without realizing it. What did you do, who did you see? Nothing. I've interviewed a guy for the newspaper about a film. That's all. In a cafe? Here? Where? At the bar of his hotel. But later, did you see him at his hotel? No, he picked me up. He came here? You decided to see him here? Yes. - And what does he look like? - Not bad. - Not bad? - His movie is really good. But we didn't stay here, we had dinner out. Did you think you appealed to him? I don't know. I suppose. Finally yes, I hope so. Don't you think we are getting away from the child? Who knows? And afterwards did you came back here? No, we went for a beer in a cafe. And then you told him you really wanted a child from me. I told him we had decided to have a baby. You liked him too much? It scared you so you wanted to stop him? How have you guessed? But that shouldn't have discouraged him. Did he bring you back here? No, I put him in a cab. I could have easily followed him to his hotel, he wouldn't have said no. Come? You stand up and repeat to me your story. Tell it to me otherwise. Make up a little. As now it's not a very exciting story. It's you I was waiting for. I could have taken him instead of you. Well, no, not of you, he could have been no one or everyone. The guy would have become no one. Sleeping with him would have had nothing to do with you. I want the rest. What kind, far or not? I can do whatever you want. I think I want a version that goes far. I want to believe it. So, he kissed me in the street and then we went to a hotel. - Did you take a taxi to the hotel? - Yes. - What hotel? - The Lotti. Stop it! Stop it! I've already said it before, I want to see you like that. Did he kiss you in the cab? Of course. Has he touched your tits too? If you want it, yes. Has he touched your tits? Yes, he's slipped a hand under my T-shirt, holding me tight. So the driver could see nothing. Nothing happened, you're forcing me to invent things. You're a pain in the arse! I don't want a child. Especially with you. We make children with girls that make you feel safe. If that exists. I'd make children with Edith or a girl who doesn't count. But certainly not with you. If you want him, you can call him. I asked you to come because I want you to promise not to see me again. I only want to see him. He's imagined a story between you and me. I told him I saw you last night, he's imagined it all the wrong way. He went away, he hasn't come back. I don't want to see you anymore. How could he be reassured with you? Inevitably guys fall in love with you. Of course he's scared. I won't see you if you want, but it'll never stop with you. You must understand, it's normal that he's trying to leave. Now he doesn't know how to come back. And unknowingly, it's the best way to keep you. He's smart, he's afraid of you. He must have had a correct life before you. What are you talking about, you don't know him. I'm the one who knows him, I can talk about him, not you. I don't understand where you're speaking from. You're not speaking as a lover, it's absurd. I can't think anymore, I can't do anything. You're not leaving me any room for anything, do you realize that? You're the one who doesn't let me exist. You've called me to come, and at once you've told me to stay away. What am I? I speak just to exist a little. I'm trying to picture him. You're right, I'm probably talking nonsense. Anyway, I'm right, he's afraid of you. He's not afraid of me just like that, that's not true. I don't want him to be afraid of me. Maybe I could talk to him. To tell him he's making things up, that it's ridiculous. Do you know where I could find him? Nothing's happened, except in my head. And what's happened in my head is not your responsibility. Your guy is a nuisance. He's imagining the same thing as you. An affair with you. And he thinks I could do it. He's less stupid than you. You haven't bothered him about a child? You're a nuisance. Did you want to follow me? Do you want to kill me in my room? - Are you talking to me? - Yes. I know what you want to know. Yes, I've kissed her, but by surprise. And she refused at once because she was in love with another guy, you. I don't know you. And if we're talking about the same girl, I'm the one who can complain. I'll kick your ass any time. Could you try to cool down? You'd need a good reason. She could have avoid being kissed. I don't think so. - One always can if one wants it. - Oh yes? Look, I'll tell you a story, and then either I'll talk to you or you talk to me but we stop fighting, alright? A guy is very much in love with his friend's woman, they end up fucking together. Then the guy goes and sees the girl's bloke and says, for me making love with her is making love with you a little. - It's a moron story. - No, I like it. But first I didn't make love with her. And secondly I'm not your friend. True, my story doesn't make sense. But if I didn't like you I wouldn't have told it to you. I don't give a fuck to be liked by you. I don't like you at all. And your story is completely stupid. You don't like stories? You just want a report from a cop? OK. After the stolen kiss, she didn't want anything, told me not to kiss her. When told not to kiss, I don't. So don't worry, she only talked about the 2 of you. I held her hand too as you don't want to be reassured. Now holding a hand isn't a drama. You putting your hand on hers makes me puke. And don't tell me whether it's a drama or not. What's convenient with you is that you talk in my place. Are there other things you do in my place? When I was holding her hand It was me stroking the hand, not her. She just let it happen, not the slightest emotion in her fingers Thinking about it, not so good. It's you she's in love with. That limp hand is rather a drama for me. What does that prove that she had dead fingers? Maybe she loved it and didn't want to show it. How do we know? She doesn't think you'll come to the party tonight. She's said she's not expecting you. In other words, she's waiting for you. Go, then the problem is over. Now, you should stand your ground, otherwise she might take her revenge with any asshole. Me, for example. She's talked about you and doesn't want to see me again. And you still want to go to this party? If I don't, sooner or later I'll be back, even without a chance. You're tiring me with your bullshit. I don't like to stay alone in hotels, so, like it or not, I'll go to this party and I won't mess up. Do you play chess? Yeah. That's the only thing that calms me down. If you lose, you'll go away, ok? OK, if I lose, I'll leave. Anyway I'd leave tomorrow. You should call him. Don't start again telling me what I should do. - How are you doing? - All right, what about you? It's a friend, your sister's friend, he's called Paul. - Hi. - I'm Juliette. Isn't Marie here? I thought you'd come together. He's the one who made it all complicated. Shouldn't we phone her? Shall I phone her right away? I consult him about everything as he's your sister's friend. Do you understand? No, you don't. I don't know, it sounds complicated. Shall I go? Why don't I know you and why isn't Marie here? She's a bit sulky but she'll come soon. He's worrying too much. I'm a friend of your sister, but I don't know if she's still friends with me. We'll soon know. It's good you came, I wasn't able to go and get you. But I came. They both came. He's pretending he's having fun. I thought you'd come. Actually no, I didn't think anything. I phoned you earlier but you were already gone. Your childish stories have driven me crazy. And also because I have troubles with the band. I wanted you to ask me about it. You only spoke about the child. ... she's bought a bottle of water, then she cuts the head of the bottle to turn it into a vase. She's carrying her flowers with great reverence. Is the guy in love with her? I think she has no idea... She doesn't want to know. She walks so much that she drinks the water in the vase in small sips, as she wants to be the only worshiper, she ends up drinking it all, when she finally arrives, the flowers are all faded. Why am I telling you that? The girl with her flowers is in love, but she doesn't want to be loved. I've decided once and for all not to understand such crazy behavior. I can, even if it's a bit far from myself right now. Unless the guy is really handsome. Are you sure she doesn't want to be loved? Who is he, how have you known him? He came to Paris to present a film. - A good one? - Not bad. The story of a woman with a child. - Can I ask you something? - Yes, go ahead. - Don't date him. - Not in love with Antoine anymore? I am, but I'd like you not to date him. OK, but I'm not happy with that. - You'll have to explain it. - There's nothing to explain. I don't like love when it pretends to be pure, it's fake. I thought it could be possible and even a bit more stylish. If the girl's alright with it, in love or not, better not be stylish too long, it gets on one's nerves. And if you're in love with a girl who doesn't want to be with you? You have to fight to please her and sleep with her. Then you'll know, for you and for her. In the wrong way. I'm afraid I'll be stylish for a long time. It's when you're a teenager, afterwards it's out. So being sentimental, and only extremely sentimental is out? Even if she doesn't want it, she'll eventually hold it against you. A guy who's only sentimental is not reassuring. My sister doesn't want me to date you. So don't waste your time. - You've had an affair with him. - No, I haven't, precisely. - That's why it lasts. - It's not, it's over. If it's over, then it started. It's over without having started. It's not happened, OK? That guy is smart, isn't he? If I were you, I'd be scared. Could you talk about something else? - You can't stop looking at him. - I'm not. Then I see it the wrong way. You're right, if he's speaking to your sister or another girl it doesn't mean anything. He keeps acting as if you weren't here. I don't like that. I wonder if I was right to invite him. Let's go back home, that way you'll give me a break. We're fine, we'll stay. I'm leaving. We're leaving, otherwise he'll be completely drunk. - I don't like him like that. - Alright. By the way, you can take whoever you want, it's none of my business. - Do you really think so? - Yeah. I don't want a child without choosing it. Antoine. Did you notice in the bathroom, there is a box with pills inside. You must take them every day. But you don't. It proves that I'm sincere, I forgot. Otherwise I'd have thrown them away and you wouldn't know it. I don't play with feelings. If I can't trust you, I won't sleep with you. It already happened and I didn't get pregnant. But you do it all the time, and when I'm not here as well. When you're not here, I don't think about it, it's normal. Do you mean that if I slept with someone else I could be pregnant? That's what you fear? You should have told it in a straightforward way. I didn't say that. It would be better. If I sleep with a guy, it's not only for sleeping. - I want condoms. - It's disgusting. The discussion is too. We've never used those things. Do you realize what you're suggesting? No, I don't think so. Give me one good reason for wanting a child. Asshole! I've swallowed all the pills I've missed. I'm tired of blaming and I'm bored of pills. I'm risking nothing, I could get a little queasy, but you don't care. By the way, I slept with a girl two months ago. You see, I can be a bitch like you. You wonder if it's true? Do you believe me or not? You want my children and you spit them in the sink. One can see how you'd like them. And how you'd take care of them later. Will they always make you puke? It's your place, if you want me to leave, let me know. Hi! - Did it end late? - 4-5 am. - How is it going with Antoine? - He's jealous of everything. And he doesn't want to make a child. - Do you want some tea? - Yes, please. You can make a child behind his back. Pretend to take the pill and then you spit it out or something like that. No, that's wrong. It's grim. It would stop everything. Then I would have forced him even if he ends up being happy with it. We'll always have to live with that. I don't like that idea at all. You must drive him to want a child. To convince him? No. You must talk to him. You'll tell him that's normal. His attitude is normal. That's true, it's alright as it's normal. And it's normal for a girl to want a child. Not even wanting a child, just being pregnant. And it's normal for a boy not wanting a child, because... for him it's not being pregnant, it's a child. And a child doesn't exist, you can't want something that doesn't exist. You can't want nothing. So it's normal he doesn't want it. And it's not possible to say you don't want it as well. He can't want it, but he can't not want it? Exactly. I'd make him deny he doesn't want it. I'd make him say if there's one, good, and if not, that's great too. If I can make him say that, I can make him make love as if for a baby. Otherwise you don't make love. You refuse. You tell him that you want both. To make love for pleasure and for a child. Now you can't have one without the other. And if I can't convince him? Total abstinence. Even though, if he still refuses? Then, I don't know. I'd threaten him, I'd say if not with you, then I'll make it with the other guy. And I'd tell him the other one would like it. But who's the other one, the new one or the old one? Well, the new future one in this case. And I'd make him believe that he thinks like me, he wants pleasure and a child. You could also tell him you're still seeing him, to make him jealous. Or you could tell him you want them both, that all your friends have already tried it and you want it too. No, it's not my way and he knows it very well. And it's dangerous. If I see the guy again, I might give in. That was close the first day, and Antoine felt it. Our pregnancy plan is falling apart. Antoine won't sleep with you as long the other one is around. You don't care about the other one, do you? Why? - Has he slept here? - Yes. Did you sleep with him? When you left, you told me I could. How have you slept with him? I don't understand? I suppose he has loads of condoms in his pockets. I have some in my bag. - How have you slept with him? - You're annoying! I don't remember, I was drunk. If you don't remember, you've slept with him without anything. - I hope he's gone? - He's sleeping. You make movies to kiss as many girls as possible? It's L'Homme qui aimait les Femmes? That sucks. You sleep with all the girls and you're in love if they don't want to. So my sister has lost, you should have explained the rules. Your sister isn't anyone, and I was angry with you. And your sister is better than any girl. Do you realize all the crap you're telling me? So you've had a little taste of incest, has that pleased you? I meant now I'm really sure I'm in love with you. It would be easy to fall in love with your sister. Luckily I came to my sister's, I'd never have known about it. It's easy to make fun of me. I don't sleep with someone I don't love, so no one makes fun of me. Same thing for me, usually. And I always love them a little. This not to be annoyed about what I've just said. Some kind of exception? As you don't sleep with someone you don't love. It was just to make sure you're a man of principles. You can always make fun of me. It's an easy game. Reproaches from someone who forbids everything, even to herself. No right to kiss you, your sister to get close to me, and your boyfriend came so I'd stay away. - So what are you doing next to me! - I'm not the one who forbids! Could you walk slower? I don't mind leaving and not seeing you again, but I want to marry you. It's romantic. But it's mainly dumb. Do you propose every time you're turned down? It's the first time. Let's marry in secret. Right after I'll leave you alone. No one will ever know, but I will. I don't like marriage more than you, but I'd like it with you. These are stupid seduction plans. I hate guys like you. I was sincere. It changes nothing. Your marriage idea is stupid. What for? To tell me you'll never leave me? That's silly since we'll split right after. And guys like you always leave girls. Because you feel that I don't trust you, so I'll stop been afraid of you? Something like that, to reassure me. No, it's to know there is something between us that nobody knows. It's also a way to leave you, telling you it's not me who wants to leave you. I won't see your sister, and I won't watch the others if you don't want me to. I can't leave Antoine. Never. And if I'm in love with him, I can't forbid you anything. You're right, you can do what you want. All I want is you. I wanted and I still want to marry you. I didn't want to persecute you or sleep with you. It wasn't that. It's because I know you won't leave him. But if I don't, what's the point? You don't want to hear what I say. Is there someone waiting for you in Marseille? - No one. - Liar! No one important like you. There's everyone and no one, if you prefer. If I had to be reassured, you'd find the words! You've never kissed me. I did, once, you didn't. Once, have you already forgotten? True, but I didn't even see it coming. It's an important kiss but not that much. Just to stun me and throw me more easily into the taxi. Do you think I saw yours coming the first time? I'd like you to kiss me. I wish you'd have done it before I asked. Why? Now you've asked, you want it less? Yes, but a little less. Do it! No, not like that. Should I want it in your place? I don't want anything in your place. Alright. You don't want to kiss me, I don't care. I'm leaving. If I walk into a building, I wish you to meet me on the first floor. What do you care if I kiss you or not? Is it to end it up less like a loser? I can't leave you like that. In the street, in broad daylight, I can't. You could understand that, I can't. Look, Eric, he turned Valerie on and she fell madly in love with Pierre. Yet the other one really turned her on. One must say Eric is a pro. He was upset though he was never in love with Valerie. But he liked her to be in love with him. You're right, I have no rights on him. And probably I'm not in love with him. Not as much as the word means. Go on sleeping with him. It's not only about sleeping, don't be rude. You got rid of him. Don't avenge by making it a fuck story Are you sure he still wants to sleep with you? - No, I'm not sure. - Haven't you thought about it? Sure I have, but you're a bitch for asking me. When he says he's in love with me, I have a hard time believing it. I can't believe he's that much in love. He wouldn't have slept with you. Maybe he's like Eric, or like me according to you. If he's sincere, I can't deny him being in love with me. I think we won't see each other anymore. That's what I told him. He was lying before, telling stories, we must not believe him. I want Antoine, I only want him. I went to the chemist's, I've bought what you've asked for. I've talked to my sister about the child thing. She said I shouldn't bother you with that all the time. It wasn't all the time. It was once, that's all. You've got no reason to want a child, that's what we've thought. I'll be cautious with the pill. You talk as if you wouldn't like a child with me anymore. No, you're wrong. Are you going to leave the condoms here or will you have them with you to sleep with whoever you want? Store them wherever you want, none of my business. You're sick to want a child with me. Children are for keeping the other when you're not in love anymore. And it's one more person, and I don't want you to like one more person. You've got no reason to want a child, leave it. You would only have wrong reasons. If you want it, I am alright with it. Don't try to please me. You can't want a child, so forget it. Why? Because of this guy? This guy is in your head. That's why you see him everywhere. Yes, it's me, your son. I want your advice. You're my mother, you can listen to me for 5 minutes? She wants a child. Who? Marie! Who else? Course, with me! I'm not calling you to ask you if you agree or not. No, she's not pregnant, but she wants to be. She can't understand one can sleep with a girl and not want a child. Well, now she understands, but then she no longer wants a child. The question is, do girls have more reasons to want a child than boys? I can answer questions, you make me look like a pain in the arse. Hold on a second! I think the answer is that guys can only have wrong reasons. Why? If they have wrong reasons, they should be the same as the girls. No, maybe the girls have something that guys haven't. They don't need reasons for wanting a child. They want one, that's it. And what are the guys' wrong reasons? Fear? Fear of losing her? When they think they want a child it's to replace something. A guy wants children because of weaknesses, because he has problems with his job, because his girl had a child with another one, or because his ex has had a child since they split. - What can I do? - Just say you're alright with it. That's what I said 5 minutes ago. You didn't say it that way. You should really tell the girl: it's up to you. Without a second thought. Without even thinking. Have you heard? She thinks guys want children because of weaknesses, that it's normal I'm not looking for it, but I shouldn't worry. Hold on, I'll put her on. The starting point is that if I sleep with a guy, it's not only for fun. I find it disgusting to sleep just for the sake of it. She thinks I'm almost as reactionary as the damned pope. Tell her you're playing the prude instead of being with 2 guys. It's about the other guy that I'm worried. I don't care about the child. You can tell her yourself. I'll put him on, he wants to talk to you. Mom, don't move, I'm coming, ok. What are you doing all alone? I've come to be picked up, like everyone else. There are worst ideas. Yes, but I can't. Is it because of me? No, it's me. Though I like you. It's not enough. You know that nuts like you, are much more common than one thinks. Every girl I meet has fallen on her head. So go back home to your boyfriend. I have two boyfriends. Your ways don't impress me. If I were more friendly, could I be the third boyfriend? - No way. - Too bad. - Bye. - Bye. - Is he here? - Yes. He's sleeping in the back room. I'd like to talk to him. You can. I wanted to talk to you. Even if it's to say unpleasant things, I'm happy to see you. I'm not here for that. You want me to tell you why you've come? Yes. I'll find something, don't worry. I was sad and not very pleased with myself. So let's say you came because you were sad. Yes especially because I'm not holding my commitments. We don't have any, you don't want it. It's not with you, rather with me. When my father died, I thought that even if he was often anxious, he had a lot of fun. And I've decided my life would be happier than before. I haven't changed that much, I'm pretty grim. I thought that with the spirit of my father, I'd do better. I had known that guy for a long time and I let myself be loved by him. And I was right, rather, my father was right. I don't think I've come here to tell you that. Anyway, I like confidences. Especially yours. I've had an argument with him. At once he disappears. Yes, I know. Yes, I had forgotten. But I'm a bit like that, I don't like arguing. He noticed it, so now he fucks off just before me. If you're here, you've fucked off too. Not that much, I'm at my sister's. And I didn't know you were still here. He'll come back. Yes. You also wanted to know if I was here? Yes. Should I ask you to hug you? - Yes. - Would your father agree? I don't know, I guess so. I can't decide for you? No. I can't hug you against your father's will? No, if it happens, I should do it, I should not be forced, I mustn't have excuses. It's not my father who decides alone. I'm leaving tomorrow, you'll have a rest. Maybe I love you too. Even if you're not serious, even if you sleep with lots of girls. I don't want to talk anymore. And I don't want to fuck. I wish I were a girl able to live alone a little. To live alone in the world and I can't do anything. Alone in the world doesn't mean not meeting anyone, on the contrary. To me, it just means going on. Especially if we don't know the road, instead of being afraid of everything that's coming. I like that in you. I shouldn't worry about Antoine. It doesn't mean I'm not worried. Can I sleep with you? You're asking me? You're here? I've already come once, and as you weren't here, I thought there was no use waiting, there was no one to wait for. You're back to tell me how it happened? You're going to give me some details? Because if you tell me you've slept with him, you won't teach me much. I'm not dumb enough to believe nothing has happened. Not this time. You're really a bitch. I don't want to see you anymore. I've had trouble understanding about the child. I see the guy lurking around you, I warn you, you go anyway. You don't hide, you confess it right away. You tell it quietly. Call the guy to kick me out. At least I'd see your two faces together for real. What was in your mind? What did it do to you? Were you happy before, during and after? Did you sleep well? Better, worse? You must tick the boxes to see if you're 3/4 bitch, or more or less? Did you manage to stay in the same bed or did you kick him away? Could you kiss him afterwards? Afterwards, did you kiss him? Your face is just to discourage me? I'll never hurt you again. I didn't try to cheat on you. Your words aren't worth anything. Is there nothing left with me? You're horrid to tell me that. I'm talking bullshit because I'm only thinking about the other one in you. And I couldn't sleep with you the night right after him. He's infected your womb, don't you realize it? Nothing will stay in me. It's impossible because I don't want it. If I don't want it, it's stronger than everything else. Nothing will stay. If there's one remaining, I'll smash its head. And it will fall like a louse after vinegar. You're dumb, you're really dumb. Do you want me? Do you want me? Yes. And when he fucked you, was it as funny as now? You don't have to answer. There's no need for me to know if you came or not. I've never heard you talk like that. Do you prefer "enjoy", "orgasm" do you want it scientific, do you want it from the dictionary? Where are you going? I'm the one who's leaving. My children will win, they won't leave. They will win. Come with me. I'll close you completely. There should be a cork somewhere in those fucking drawers. Stop it! He is at the caf?, he won't come up. I don't want to talk to him. He drives me crazy and he drives himself crazy too. Is Antoine here? He must leave, if you tell him, he might hear it. Will you call me tonight? I don't want to see you. You see me anyway. If I came down, it's because of my sister. She can't stand to see you anymore. It's really nasty to her. - Don't you want to sit down? - What's the difference? Nothing, but for talking about your sister you could sit down. I don't want to talk about me. You have to leave. For your sister or for you? If I say it's for me too, will you leave? Yes. - Then say it. - I've already said it. You said it with an "if" and a question mark, not that way. You heard it very well, just remove "if" and the question mark. - No, it's your job. - What does it change? I'd rather be kicked out because I'm somewhat important. You're too dangerous for me. Are you leaving now? I won't come back unless I can't do otherwise. It depends if you let me live or if you spend your time nibbling my brain. I've never experienced that before, that strong, never. Sorry. Are you going, don't you want to stay? You're not honest. We exist and you don't want to acknowledge it. I did, that's not true. You have to leave. Go away! Go away! Hi! I've changed my mind. Mail him back, I don't want to read it. Maybe he doesn't want anything. Is it what scares you? You're not funny. It's less personal if I read it, right? Come on, shall I open it? Whatever. There is a plane ticket. That's a good start. "The first days were a relief, but it didn't last. I spend my life with you. A large part of the day and the evening too. And part of the night, that's a lot. And after a while one feels very sad. Did you feel that sadness or didn't it go through your mind " I didn't and I don't want to see him again You've promised me something. I want you to hold on to it. I'll be waiting for you at Montreal airport in two days. You'll leave on the same day. I won't, he's crazy. What did you promise? He was alright to leave on one condition: that I got married in secret to him. - I wouldn't have said no. - That's completely stupid. It would eventually come out and it would hurt Antoine. A lot. And I don't want to live two stories at the same time. That's what he says: You'd tell me that your heart is too small for two boys at once, you're dumb, hearts of lovers are never too small. He's a poet. Don't you ask me if I'm not tired of being sad because of you? Yes I do, that's why I want you to hold onto your promise. What's the point? He would be even sadder afterwards. We don't know. Who knows? And if you have no heart and no word, that's too much. Thanks a lot. Are you afraid for Antoine or for you? Who are you protecting? Antoine and me. The both of us. We'd never slept with the same bloke before. Can you imagine his comparisons? Stop that. I hope that when we get old, we'll tell each other. We might say things about him too. We'll have forgotten it all. We should write our diary. Canada would make two volumes of the diary. Think of our future. Can't you see his idea is just stupid romanticism? Sometimes it's nice. I would have stayed with him. It's a trap. He's offering a fucking wedding, but his real idea is to get me in the long run. Check the date of the return flight. Is it the same day? Yes, that evening. To reassure me. He's clever. I've never seen you so upset with a bloke. And you'd have nothing to fear if you wouldn't care. - I don't fear him. - You are shaking inside. Make sure not to pretend to live, that's all I have to say. I'm not a lover like you. You decide to live with the one who won't turn you crazy. - You think very small. - Maybe. Let's call on Irina, she'll read our cards, we'll have a laugh. - I won't. - We'll know everything about him. I wonder if I'm not pregnant. Is it a problem? Not at all, but it's the first time that I've slept with 2 guys. What do you suppose? Nothing. I've looked up in my diary and I can't find the last time. I've never been late, and it's been quite a long time. - And you, what do you think? - That I'm pregnant. - But whom? - I often change my mind. Irina we'll tell it soon. To start with, we are vibrations. We emit vibrations we receive vibrations. Alright? Then, one is more or less gifted, I can be wrong, it's not my job. Finally, we ask questions, If the pendulum turns like that, it's positive, if it oscillates like that it's negative, if it doesn't move, if there's no vibration, he won't answer. It doesn't want to give the answer, it's not a good sign in general. Shall we start? Which one of us is the best kisser? You're dumb. It can't be answered by yes or no. So, do I kiss better than my sister? You're moving it. No, even so it would go back to oscillations. Either way it comes back to negative. Anyway it's yes, then. It's stupid; really stupid. Who's the best fuck? Sorry, do I fuck better than her? Is one of us going to have children? Ask if you're pregnant. Am I pregnant? The answer is weak, but it looks rather like a yes. It's yes. Is this boy the father? - Where did you get it? - From a newspaper. - And you carry it with you? - He's not alone. It won't answer. But it doesn't say no. - It answers when it suits itself. - Not at all. - Ask for the wedding. - No, that's enough. - Do you want some tea? - Yes, please. No thank you. At first he's the father and then it doesn't want to answer. He looks better in real life? He's not very photogenic. - What do you think? - I'm a better fuck. You'll ask him when you see him, I'd be surprised. That's why he preferred me, it's the only reason. You've decided this month to be pregnant? Twice more likely. Have you decided who's the father? I went to see a clairvoyant, she told me you're the father. The clairvoyant has decided. That's pretty stupid. I haven't seen a clairvoyant. Too bad it's not both of us, about the father. You'd have preferred a little mix, I guess. - What are you going to do? - I don't know. You don't. I do. I didn't want a child with you, but then a child of another guy, certainly not. It's your child. I can't feel anything in me that hints at it. If you don't want it, I'd go with the one who wants the child. I can't agree about your story with the other one. I can't make it. It's over and you know it very well. What about his photo in the paper? Why do you leave it in the kitchen? Every day I hope you'd notice that the fucking photo is hurting me, But the newspaper is still there. Every time I want sugar in my tea, his fucking face. So no more sugar in my tea. He's a guy for diets. And he's so happy with himself in the photo who looks like he doesn't want to smile too much, and doesn't like being photographed. You know that newspaper is there. You know it drives me crazy to see his face in it. Even if you pretend that if not hidden, it doesn't matter. Are you expecting me to get used to it. Because in the photo it's obvious he's saying I love you. When I look at him, I can see his eyes on you, he's not looking at me He's not saying anything to me. Sorry, I haven't noticed it. Maybe I'm dumb but I wanted to tell you something else: - You're taller. - It's not funny. I swear, you're taller, come and see. Come here! Stand up straight! Move over! It must be 1m71, then. See, you're so happy when you're a bit higher. I haven't changed a bit, you can check it. If you take a cm every time you meet a guy, things are going wrong. You don't look surprised to see me. I'm surprised you're not. I believed in it, but I wasn't sure at all. You might be so-so being here, but still be a little happy to see me? Here! It's very good so it'll necessarily appeal to you. You want to buy me with a book? Yes, if it's a good book, it's worth more than you. I knew it wouldn't be a piece of cake. I just want the book. I have been panicking for an hour. It used to be alright with you. At Roissy airport you were like a sticky fly. Each time you appeared, I tried to hit you. I thought, don't think about him. Don't think about him, or you won't be able to go on board. I hoped you wouldn't be there on arrival, I clung to that. Then I hoped the plane would crash. That would have been its best option. Will you be less interested since I came? No, but if I had thought about it, I couldn't have imagined you would. When you wrote to me, I was so angry. I would have been too if you hadn't. You had no chance, both ways. Can I tell you something? Speak out! No, later; I couldn't now. I have to tell you. Going where? One should say: where are we going. If you say so, then you've prepared your sentence for a long time and you're scared to go. Can we go to your hotel before? Are we not doing what we should? I have to tell you something beforehand. I'm not in a hotel, a friend has lent me his flat. I'm thinking again of him, it's normal. It's normal to blame you too, isn't it? Can you do something with the other girls? Something that doesn't make you sad? I'm not in the mood for other girls. What are you trying to tell me that I don't understand? Antoine made me pregnant. Have you come to tell me that? That way you avoid everything, convenient. You wouldn't have slept with me if you were pregnant. What proves it's him and not me? - You're not in the right dates. - It's too vague. You know nothing. If you were sure it's him, you'd never have come. I want you to find a private clinic. I don't want to be pregnant by him and marry you. You want me to tell you that you must keep the child? You want me to agree about the child? That's what you want? No. I believe I'm the father. You believe it too, that's why you've come. - I don't believe you. - That's why you've come. Kiss me. You appeal to me. But if you think you've caught me, you're wrong. Wait till I've regained my strength and you'll see. I need to call him. What's before the number? 011 331 and your number. The address? 42 11 Esplanade. It's me. You were right, I went to find him. You have to come and get me. It's him, he's despicable because I can't make it, I can't free myself from him. And he wants to keep the child even if it's not his. I want you to come. If I can't, then you must come. 42 11 Esplanade, in Montreal. That was the answering machine. Why is he not there? Do you want me to leave? I don't know. It doesn't change my feelings for you. We can go to the wedding, but we'll have to divorce if there's a child. We're not going to the wedding, it doesn't make sense. That was stupid to force you to come, and to scare you. I wanted to steal you, but you can't do that, that's stupid Was he alright about the child? He didn't want it. Are you sure it's his? No, it could be yours. I'd like you to keep the child. I can't promise it. When was it scheduled? It's almost past. - We could, just like that? - Yes. With a passport and a birth certificate. I had a friend call for yours. It's not very legal but it worked. A not too fussy Protestant church. They've just asked for an interview to find out why we'd marry, that's it. Do we need rings? They're not gorgeous, but they're not meant to have them on, except mine. Can I see if it suits me? I tried it on the shop assistant. I didn't like it when she put it on. Marry the shop assistant, I have too big paws for you. It's nasty for him that I've come, and nasty for you too. It's alright, danger is gone, you're not made for that. You think so? It's the opposite, I'm better than you. Do you want to sleep with me? I do. Will you keep our child? Yes. Let's do what we've decided. Wait outside, I'll get a taxi. - Is it there? - Yes. It's better if one of us is Protestant, so you're the one. I've asked without an organist, I thought it wouldn't please you. I can't. Let's have a look in the church. It's not pretentious. You'll see how you feel. Or rather at the pretty little graves, behind... It may be more positive? I asked them to make it short. At the town hall there would have been a speech too. And don't forget, it's a commitment before God. You won't make me laugh. Do we really have an appointment? I think so. I'm starting to believe you, I don't even feel like seeing the pretty little graves anymore. If we join hands, does it help? No. Good Morning! Excuse us, we're a little late. It doesn't matter, sit down. Good Morning. Well. We'll talk about the promises you'll share, those words. It's not to please the pastor whom you don't know, it's to know the meaning and the motives of this marriage for you and to see where your faith stands. I guess we're looking for the same God even if he has different names. I don't know what to say. On the meaning of marriage, it's even more complicated for me. I've promised to marry him. But those promises you've exchanged, this commitment has to be as true as possible. I say it because you seem very vague about the motivations of your commitment before God. But if I'm vague, it's for very complicated reasons. Very private things between the two of us. If you tell me in your own way you refuse to talk to me, you put me in a very embarrassing situation especially because you don't belong to this parish and I know nothing about you. What do you want me to say? I've promised to marry him, but I hate him because he does everything he can to snatch me from another boy I love as well. But today she has decided to get married, no one has forced her. I get married and then I leave to go back to the other boy. You aren't planning to live together? No. I am, but I've accepted her reasons. Are there obligations to live together? You want to get married not to live together? That's it. Why not marry at the courthouse, they won't ask you any questions? He thinks I might be pregnant by him, perhaps that's why, for the baby. Are you pregnant? Yes, but perhaps by the other boy. You put me in an impossible situation. I understand, we're not ready. Excuse us. I'm sorry, sorry. That was a narrow escape. Are you happy? You're really dumb! You're the dumb one, if you'd made it just saying yes and some impressive music you'd see me in tears and it would have worked. I don't believe you. Even so you'd make me pay for it afterwards. So what, since I was leaving. I'll tell the ex-witnesses to leave. Was there a wedding lunch too? - Why, are you hungry? - Yes, I'm hungry. I'm sorry for you. Why did you want to get married in church? It was close to the airport and it was a rather nice place. You'd rather get married at the town hall or synagogue? The synagogue would have impressed me. I wouldn't have been silly. We'll eat in Montreal. No, you go straight to the airport. I want to go to the apartment because I want you. You really don't want to marry me? No, I don't. - How much was it? - None of your business. - Can't you get it back? - Hardly. For 150 dollars I'd have got rid of you. And the travel expenses, I'm worth more than that. I'd like that Antoine would not come. If he comes, go away and don't try to see me again. You're the one who'll leave. You're the one playing with me. Casually, you're exploiting me. It's getting too tough for me, I don't want to love you anymore. Then I'll leave. No, I'll drop you at the airport right now. I can't leave you and you can throw me on a plane! It's the basis questionnaire of this church where you've been so smart. I'm asking the questions? I don't care about your questions. If we had prepared it that would have been so easy. I'm reading: my life (me) I'm at the end of my life and looking at it... I'm not and I don't want to look at it, it's too ugly right now. I'd like to see... that's where one must answer. I'm not answering that crap. I'm at the end of my life, I'm looking at it and I'd like to see... Not you. Not you. The answer is arguable, but it's an answer anyway. Then. I'd like to have achieved... Nothing! I'm afraid it's not really good either. I'd like to find, see, smell - something - that'd make me say, I've succeeded. It makes me feel like crying. I'd rather you cry, when you sulk it drives me crazy. New question, even more difficult, You and Me. Here there is every reason to cry. I imagine my life with you as... With you, terrible, impossible. Thank you. See how you are. You want to be able to get me back when it suits you. I know what I'll do. I'll seduce a rather cute and clever girl, that way, you'll come back and peck in my hand. Who will do what... In our common life together, what will you do? I'll prevent you thinking about other girls by living with Antoine. Who will do what? Me... - Seduce girls. - No, I'm the one to answer. Then find another answer if you can. I really wanted to marry you. I liked it. Me too. Less than you, but I've failed. I've never trusted you. You wanted to make movies, to travel, to meet people, other girls. I couldn't trust you. You had no idea how much it scared me. I couldn't have fought against that. He'll arrive tomorrow. I'm crazy to stay with you. I don't like what you think of me. I don't like you saying I'm using you, and cruelty and everything else. You're the one who uses others. Do you imagine if he saw me kissing you? If you came back you're still hoping he won't come. I believe he'll come. Do you hope so? I don't know anymore. Yes he'll come. All the mess is over. I've lost blood and it hasn't been as usual. I won't have a child with you. All you do is against me. It means that my life is with Antoine. Unless it was his, it'd prove the opposite. I'm empty. At my age you get pregnant every other time if not paying attention. Now you regret. No, I don't regret. I'll have a child with him, it's better. Now I'm sure he'll come. He doesn't want a child with you. He hates you because you're with me. You know he won't come. He will come. If we don't want to be sad, it's easy. We could say you're a virgin. You can get pregnant by whom you want. I don't want a child anymore. I wanted it if it was there, that's all. The child couldn't be his and mine. Now he will be mine. No, we won't sleep together again. I can't. I don't want and there is still much blood, it's not over. I really wanted a child. If he wouldn't come, maybe we could make it together. - Where is she? - She was waiting for you. - She was there earlier. - I want to see her. - I don't want to talk to you. - Go find her wherever you want. - You want to attend the reunion? - Yes, are you happy? Of course I'm happy. The girl I love fled away with a bastard, and asked me to pick her up. I've never been alone with her, you're always between us, you're a nightmare. Till she comes back, I should beat you up. You're the one who gets angry? - I want to see her, where is she? - No idea. She's afraid of you, of what you think, can you understand that? She might want to see us together? Have you not yet convinced her you're better than me? Fuck off! I'm tired of waiting. What are you waiting for? Nothing; just to find her. Do you want this child? No. You say that to make me happy? Are you sure don't want a child with her? No, and she said she's not pregnant anymore. Maybe she never was, I don't know. You know things! I've come but I shouldn't have. Is it not him you wanted? Are you sure? I've been waiting for you for ages. - No regrets? - Who cares about regrets. We shouldn't leave him, let's put him in a taxi. We'll tell him to leave if it makes you happy. I didn't know anymore if you would come. Would you have stayed here? No, I would have gone even further. With him? I don't know. Yes. Not for long. - You're not pregnant anymore? - No, it's over. Are you sad? I don't know. Him, it was for the child? Yes. Not only? Not only. Were you happy to see us together, me with him? Not like that. We haven't slept together. Let's walk a little. Let's walk a little. Has anyone asked you to leave? How do you want me to leave, shaking your hands? I was afraid you'd run behind the first one that would flee. He doesn't need us so we don't need him. He's the one letting us down. That was too stupid having two lovers at the same time. We won't miss him. Even without a baby, do you still want me? We'll think about it. Yes, we'll think. It's done. Yeah, it's done. Shit, I've forgotten a book in the house. We'll find another one. Yeah, it doesn't matter.
