[INTRODUCTION MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [COMEDIC HONKING] -Pauline, what's this? -Bacon. -Well, I know this. -We've already had our allowance for the month. -You mean-- -Not another slice until next Wednesday. -Good morning, darling. -Good morning, darling. -I've never seen such a man for bacon. -Never seen such bacon for a man. -(STERN) Pauline. Where's Nanette? -She's already had her breakfast, what there was of it. Bread pudding and milk. Not my idea of a breakfast. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [GRUNTING] -(FOREIGN ACCENT) Good morning, Ms. Nanette. -Good morning, Styles. -(FOREIGN ACCENT) Good morning. Say, Ms. Nanette, I don't want to seem "insquisixtive" but, um, how are they feeding you up at the house? -Oh. How do they feed me? Well, uh, this morning I had orange juice, strawberries and cream, poach eggs on toast-- -Poached eggs? -(AGREEING) Poached eggs. -Do you know what they gave Pauline and Remington this morning for breakfast? -Bread pudding with milk. -Oh, that sounds horrible. -Sounds horrible? It would be alright if you only had to listen to it, but you got to eat it. -Your horoscope says, beware of 1940. Sun in Taurus, moon in Capricorn. You are externally a materialist, but this is a liable. In reality, an idealist with a tendency to dissipate cash. And that's where I come in. -Darling, we have a million in the bank. -My darling, always looking on the bright side. Even in '29 when everyone's business was crashing right to left, you were optimistic. -Are they eating apples? -Oh, yes. Delicious. But she don't eat them. She Cancer. [MUSIC PLAYING] Just imagine, a little stalk like this holding up a great big apple like that. -Yeah. She calls that one, Taurus. And this one, she calls Sagitariu-- Sagi-- Sagi-- Sagi-- This one is called, Plato. And this one is called-- -It came off in my hands. -(MISUNDERSTANDING) It came off in my hands. No. That's silly. She calls it-- What did you do? What did you do? You waste the [INAUDIBLE]. You got to stick it back. What are we going to do? -Keep calm, Styles. Can't put Taurus back, can we? Would you like half? -Yes. No, no, no, no, no. -Come on, you have half. -Alright. No. I got a wife and four kids. [MUSIC PLAYING] -It came collect. -Send it back collect. Give it back to the boy. MRS. SUSAN SMITH: Oh, a mistake? -Terrible. -Maybe it's for me. -No, no, no. It's my mistake. -You, you got to swallow the core, so there won't be no finger prints. -My little lamb. Some deal went wrong? No deal at all, really. I never thought it was. -Here she comes. Quick. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Uncle, yoohoo. Uncle. -(FOREIGN ACCENT) I don't mind mashers and macaroni. I don't even mind sending the paper napkins out to be dry cleaned. But when she asks me to put yellow soap instead of cheese in the mousetraps? I'm leaving and [INAUDIBLE]. -What is the matter, Uncle? -Nanette, I'm in a mess. -Business? -No. -Hey. Not Auntie? -No. -Well, what is it? -Oh, well don't think I mean-- Well, I don't mean it in a way. See, the poor girl had lost her purse. -What poor girl? -A lovely Russian girl I met on the Albany night boat. -(DISGUSTED) Uncle. -Oh, no. No, Nanette. It's not what you're thinking at all. Don't you see, Nanette, she was terribly anxious to go on this date and her family, some kind of nobility, objected and cut her off. -Without a penny? -Without a penny. So I lent her some money for acting lessons. -Uncle, that girl didn't need any lessons. So? Oh, Uncle. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Uncle, why? -Well, you see, I'm a very ordinary man, trying to work out life's happy plan. Doing unto others, as I'd like them to do unto me. When I find a very lonely sole, to be kind becomes my only goal. I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy. [MUSIC PLAYING] -(SINGING) I want to be happy. I won't be happy until I make them happy, too. -(SINGING) Life's really worth living when we are both giving. Why can't I give some to you? Uncle, I've got an idea. Pay off this Russian you found. She'll go back to Syracuse for the right amount. -The right amount out of my miserable allowance? -Oh, no bonds? -Well, no. Only the ones under Susan's name. -Oh, yeah. No jewelry? -I don't know. -No jewelry. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Mr. William Trainor, sir. Calling from the Elbee theatre. -I'm busy, Remington. I can't talk to anyone. -Very good, sir. -And stop bothering me, Remington. -Yes, sir. -Remington? Who did you say? -A Mr. Trainor, miss. -Uncle. You know, William Trainor's a theatrical producer. -Yes. -Oh, well, Remy? -Yes, miss. -Uncle, talk to him. What are you thinking? That's a miracle. -Is it? -Now you can leave it all to me. Say, it's great to hear your voice, Bill. -Say it's great to hear your voice, Bill. -Jimmy? How are you? Say, when can we get some beer together? I haven't seen you since-- Say, can't you afford a paper? I'm breaking in a new musical comedy-- -Breaking in a new musical comedy? Opening in two weeks? Called, "So Long, Sister." How do you like the title? -We'll change it to, So Long, Sonya. We'll change it to, "So Long, Sonya." -Huh? -(FOREIGN ACCENT) Hello, Bill. -Oh, hello. Be with you in a minute. -Auntie's birthday party. -Auntie's birthday party? Oh, no. It was just my little niece, Nanette. -Ask him to a party. -What? Oh, yes. Look, will you come to, you know, my wife's birthday party? -Right. I'll be there. So long, Jimmy. -Jimmy Smith? -Mmhmm. -Of North Shore? -Mmhmm. Dave, let's have the first number. DAVE: Alright, girls. -But what about me, Bill? -If you had been here just one day earlier, I had just the spot for you. -When you get into the house, you'll shine with hospitality. -Hospitality? With what? -We've got some apricot brandy in the cellar. -That's true, yeah. -You'll reminisce while you sip your brandy. You'll enjoy the music and the nice breezes. He'll take Sonya for his new show-- Oh, Uncle, all your troubles are over. [MUSIC PLAYING] -(SINGING) When skies are grey and you say you are blue, I'll send the sun smiling through. TOGETHER: (SINGING) Cause' I want to be happy. And I want you happy. And I make you happy, too. [LAUGHING] [HUMMING] -Is everything ready, Uncle? [WHISTLING] -You might drown your fish before you catch him. -Well, first we celebrate our reunion. Yes. Then, we reminisce. Then, I remind him that I backed his first play. Talk about how we knew it would succeed. Then we-- -You cry. -We cry into our glasses. Bill has his dancing star and Uncle kisses Sonja good bye. -And indigestion. Come on, darling. -There he is, pardon me. Darling. Going to all this trouble just because I'm a year older. -Oh, well I-- -It's an exquisite perfume. -Do you like it? It's called extravagant life. -That's a lovely bottle. When it's empty, I can use for a savings bank. Come take a look at the cake Maggie made me. -(WHISPERING) Leave him to me. -Maggie, that Gillespie is coming to the party. -Who's Gillespie? -He's that [INAUDIBLE] who draws those pictures of girls when they're nude, you know. -Do you mean he makes a living doing that? [DOORBELL RINGING] -The bell. -The Smith house? -(RUDE) Yes. -I'm Mr. Gillespie. -Why, Mr. Gillespie. We were just talking about you. -Really? -You know, speak of the devil. -There's the great man. -Hello. -Hello. -I'm Nanette. Nanette Smith. Uncle asked me to meet you. He's with Auntie looking at the cake. -Well, that was kind of him. And tell me of you, Ms. Smith. -Oh, you know, Uncle talks so much about you and what great pals you are. -(SURPRISED) Really? I'm flattered. At least I hope I should be. -Well, you certainly should. If you only knew what Uncle thinks about you. -You surprise me. -He was only just saying to me, he said, there wasn't anything that he wouldn't do for you. That is, If you wanted anything done. Come on, let's find him. -(NERVOUS) I think the cake's a little-- -Nanette? Nanette? Yoohoo? Oh, hello, Tom. -Hello, Sue. -I see you've met our niece. -Tom? -Gillespie. -Oh, how do you do, Mr. Gillespie? Oh, of course, we've met before. I thought he was-- I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else. -Well, not half as sorry as I am. -Tom, everyone's dying to meet you. Just because you're the man that draws the girls without the, uh, you know. -I thought it was Bill. -No. -Well, are you sure it isn't? -Yes. -That's him. -That's Bill. -(RUDE) You're late. -Thanks for reminding me. -You're welcome. -Oh, happy-go-lucky Bill. Sonya. -Sonya? From Syracuse? -Yes. -Oh, Uncle. You're joking. -At my own execution? Nanette, what am I going to do? -Uncle, you hide yourself in the conservatory, I'll get rid of her and I'll bring him into you. Now, get yourself a drink because you need it. [MUSIC PLAYING] -(NERVOUS) Call up Mr. Stillwater-- Stillwater-- Stillwater-- and Stillwater and tell him to come over here right away. It's urgent. -[INAUDIBLE] -No, no, no, no. His house. -Hi, it's nice to see you. -Susie, the same old. You haven't changed a bit. Meet Sonya Sonyavich. -Auntie, did you see that-- Why, Mr. Trainor. How do you do? How do you do? BILL TRAINOR: How do you do? -Well, actually I prefer portrait work, but my bankers prefer Gillespie girls. [LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Excuse me. May I? -Excuse me. -How are you, Tom? -Hello, Bill. Nice seeing you. -Yes. I see you. -You know, I'm always being mistaken for someone else. -Oh, are you? -Yes. It used to annoy me, but now I'm rather glad. -I'm through with the chorus. I have another place in the theatre. -Maybe. But your muscles aren't in the right place for pushing scenery. -Very funny. -Mr. Gillespie, would you like to do something for me? -Why, I certainly would. -Well, would you mind touching in and dancing with that girl over there? The one in gold. -(NERVOUS) May I? -Sure. -Bill, I've been looking for you. Come on, let's dance. -Oh, yes. I've been, uh, looking for you, too. -Now, what foot do we start with? -Oh, just let nature take it's course. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Excuse me. [DOOR SLAMMING] -Is he on his way? -Yes, sir. -You know, there are 3 Mr. Stillwaters in family. -Yes, sir. I know. -I don't wish to see Stillwater Jr. -Jimmy. Why have you been hiding? -Hiding? What would give you that idea? [LAUGHING] -Oh, that laugh. I cannot resist it. -Remington, that's all. You may go. -Right, sir. -I want only you. [LAUGHING] -Oh, excuse me. Auntie? May I take Mr. Trainor to see the picture of Grandpa? You know, the one as a boy. -What, now? -Now. -That's the [INAUDIBLE], I won't get any older. -Now, I was interested in your theatrical ambition, but friendship is one thing and the other thing is another thing entirely. -Oh, Jimmy. Is this some cruel joke? With your own lips, you said, [SINGING] -Do I make you happy, too? -I say that to everybody because I want everybody to be happy. That doesn't mean-- -It does to me, Jimmy. That twinkle in your eye could only mean one thing. -There wasn't any twinkle in my eye. At least not the twinkle you mean. It was this kind of-- -Oh, Jimmy, that's it. Me too. -Well, where's grandpa? -Oh, grandpa. Oh. He's in the cellar. Where we keep apricot brandy. You like apricot brandy, don't you? -Yes, but, just now, you see, I'm on the water wagon. -Oh. On the water wagon. -I've got your career all cut out for you. A famous producer and big, juicy part. -What part? -The dancing part. I can't tell you all the details now, but I'm going to tell you later this evening. -Oh, Jimmy. -You better keep that on because it, uh, it's a draft in here-- -Well, we'll show those other producers. They think I'm no good. They think I stink. But we'll show them, darling. -Yes, we'll show them, darling, but quietly. -(WHISPERING) Yes, Jimmy. Very quietly. You make me so happy. -(SINGING) Do I make you happy, too? -Do I hear someone singing? [SINGING] -Singing, Madame? -Yes. Sounds as though it's coming from the conservatory. -Conservatory? Oh, Madame. Just reminds me. A little bird got in there today and we haven't been able to catch it. -Oh. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hello, Bill. -How are you, Tom? -You don't mind if I'm in a little hurry, do you? I've got something to get back to. -Suits me. Cigarette? -Yes, fine. -Take your pick. Same old curves, different model. -Mary, Zoe and Mona. -Amusing little party last night. -Yes, wasn't she? I mean, wasn't it? -(LAUGHING) Rather attractive. -Yes, very. -If you like the type. -Well, yes. If you like the type. -Mr. Trainor? -Over at the table. -Hello. -Oh, hello. -I'm not late, am I? -Late? Oh, no. It's 11 o'clock. Just on time. -(SPEAKING RUSSIAN) -Oh, uh, "nee-vo." [SINGING] -Oh, Dave? Give them a break. DAVE: OK, girls. Take 10 minutes. -Max, we'll be needing you. -You know, Mr. Trainor, I think you're going to have a very great surprise. -Yes. And so are you. [GIRLS TALKING] -Now, maestro. -My name's Max. What are you gonna do? -Allegro. The first part, Allegro. The second part, andante and pianissimo. -Yeah, I know that but what-- -Watch the move. Here's where I'm the wind. Slow on the turns and the third part, I'm the swan. The same music as in the dove. -Oh, yeah. I get it. You want to kill 2 birds with one stone. [LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) -What an artist. -Yes. What an artist. -You realize, don't you, that this is only a sideline for Sonyavich. You should see her act. -Thanks. -Yes, isn't she marvelous? -Terrible. -Oh, my bag. I'm sorry I've dropped my bag. -Oh, my purse tore-- -You can fix it where we're going for lunch. -Lunch? -Yes. You know, that little thing between breakfast and dinner? -Oh, yes. Lunch. I'd just love to but I-- -That's great. -Of course, she's great. What did I tell you? She'll simply make your show. -Oh. She'd be a riot. -She gets the part. Oh, Bill. [MUSIC PLAYING] -DAVE: That's enough, girls. -That's from Uncle. -I get the part. MAX: You get the bird. -Hey. -Oh. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh, I'll take it. -Say, this must be the wrong house. You sure this is the Smith house? -Mmhmm. -It isn't a mistake? -No. -Well, she died or something. -Good evening, miss. -Oh, hello, Remington. Where's Uncle? -He's in the library, miss. And I'm afraid, bathed in gloom. -Not dissimilar in character is the case of Hovermeyer plaintiff and Crenshaw defendant in the New Paul district courts, 1917. Plaintiff charged-- -Thank goodness you're safe. Where have you been? Why are you-- -Oh, never mind that, Uncle. Thank goodness you're safe. -She didn't get the part? -She got the part. -She got the part. -What part? What part? -She got the part, Stillwater. It's all settled. -Settled? -Nanette. How did you ever do it? -Oh, it's a long story, Uncle. And my feet-- -And I was just on the point of sending out on an overdose of sleeping powders and now everything's settled. My slate is wiped clean and never again. -Oh, Uncle. I forgot. -Alright. -Nanette? -Uncle? What on earth is it now? "My father insists I marry Elmer tomorrow. Don't forget you promised you'd help me. I'm in Boston. Love, Betty." Uncle. -From Bridgeport. -Not another? -No, no. It's not another, no. This one wanted to try to make both ends meet, that's all. See, she was waiting on the table and we got into conversation and she was very unhappy about her father. She wanted to be an interior decorator, he wanted her to marry a man 2 times her age. So naturally-- -Oh, is that you, senior? The Smith affair. He's broken out in another place. -Pauline? Did you get everything of Mr. Smiths? Shoes, shirts, suits, woolen underwear, woolen socks. -Don't wear them in New York. It's too hot. -Do you mind if Mr. Smith has cold feet? -Not if you don't. -Jimmy, you do pick the oddest times for your business trips. [HONKING] Auntie there's the taxi. -Alright. [PHONE RINGING] -Oh, I must answer the phone. -Stop it. Let Remington answer it. -Oh, yes. -Goodbye, Madame. -We have plenty of time. -It's daylight savings time. -That means we've gained an hour. -No, darling. It means we've lost all the sunlight now. -The Smith home. Yes, madame. From Bridgeport? Mr. Smith has left. He's going around the world twice and he won't be back for 5 years. No, madame. He's going around the world-- I really don't care where your from. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] -Madame, you are no lady. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Here we are. Practically at the door. -Yes, that's the door. -Pauline, isn't New York wonderful? -But it's small. It looks much bigger in the movies. -Just think, 7 million souls in one city. -Yes, and goodness knows how many heels. -Oh, Pauline. -Allow me, madame. -No, thank you. We can manage, thank you very much. -You know, Jimmy. This looks awfully expensive. Do you think we should use our right name, Smith? -Why not, darling? -Well, you know, a big publisher like you, they might recognize you and charge us extra. -How about adding another "h," hm? -You're quite pleased here. She'll never find you in New York. -No. [DOG BARKING] -(SPEAKING FRENCH) -Betty. Bridgeport. -Kitty from Kansas. -Kitty from Kansas? -She's an artist. Paints, you know. [DOG BARKING] -(FRENCH ACCENT) Is there a page for Katherine Revere. -No, madame. -Merci. Come, come. [DOG BARKING] -Jimmy? Jimmy? -What? -You're always disappearing as if you were trying to hide from someone or something. -Hide? Me? [LAUGHING] -Oh, this is not a laughing matter. You know, this is a very bad day for Taurus people. -(FRENCH ACCENT) Happen you to know wrong, has the motorcar arrived? -Oh. -Oh. Look, my dear, I don't think we ought to stay here. -Oh, I like it. They've given us a special rate. -Uncle thinks it isn't safe. -What? Yes. Termites. -From California? Someone might have brought them in a suitcase. -Oh, nonsense. How could anyone make a living doing that? Come on, let's look at the rooms. When he does arrive, will you kindly tell him that Ms. Revere is not in the habit of being kept waiting. -Yes, madame. KITTY (OFF SCREEN): Yoohoo. Yoohoo. [DOG BARKING] -Yoohoo. -Floors, please? -10. -13. -13. -Kansas. How nice. We'll be neighbors. -Oh, "tres charmant." [LAUGHING] -Why, Mr. Flirtle-Wirtle. -(FOREIGN ACCENT) Why, Ms. Revere. -Mr. Flirtle-Wirtle. -The charming Ms. Revere. Floor 13, please. What a lovely surprise. -Oh, how terribly, terribly good to see you. -Are you exhibiting? -Oh, "mais non." I don't feel I'm ready. -Ah, take me. In art, if the soul is ready, the hand is ready. You need only thirst for truth, the fingers will respond. -Well, true. -My dear, stick to bright colors. Don't you ever develop a taste for pastels. -I know. I took a whole bottle last week and my cough was daftly bad. [LAUGHING] -Pauline? Pauline, how'd you know Mr. Flirtle-Wirtle's friend was from Kansas? -The accent. -Uncle, 3 of them? -Yes. And on the floor? -Oh, but Kitty isn't here. But you would only think so. -You're right. I certainly would not. I suppose she lost her purse, too? No, she was wasting her time with as a manicurist and all the time she had the makings of a great portrait painter. -I see. Well, it felt so natural. Wouldn't you have done the same if Rembrandt had come to you? -Not if he moved his hips like Kansas Kitty. -Jimmy, you look faint. Darling, you're working too hard. Doing too many things at once. -Auntie, I was just telling Uncle exactly the same thing. -Makes me dizzy. Now I hear there's been a lot of suicides here. -Really? Open the window wide, darling, will you? -I'll just opened one. -Good. -Uncle, we've got to figure this out. -I should have jumped with the other boys in '29. -I've got an idea. Just how badly does your little friend want to paint? -Well, she'd rather paint than eat. -She would? Good. -See, I've been a sort of fairy godmother to her. -Information, please. Uncle, you can leave it all to me. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I suppose you thought it was pretty mean of me to go off and leave you flat as I did. -Oh, that's quite a long walk. -And yet, you asked me to show you the town. That was very forgiving. -Well, I'm glad you think that. -Can I do anything to square accounts? -Oh, yes, you can. That is, if I can think of anything. -Please try. -Oh, strangely, an idea is just coming into my mind. -Good. Good. -Oh, it isn't quite there yet. -Well, maybe a whiff of the Hudson would help it along. Come on. -Yes, maybe it would. All this makes me wish I were an artist. -Have you ever tried your hand? -Uh, no. I haven't but-- -You should. You'd find it fun. -Oh, yes. I suppose if the soul is ready, one only needs to thirst for truth and the fingers will respond. -Yes, I see what you mean. -I have a friend who's-- -Would you like to see where I painted my first picture? And sold it? -I'd love to. [MUSIC PLAYING] -John. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. Oh, I like this. It's quaint. -Oh, John? May we have some tea? -And cozy. -Oh, hey. [MUSIC PLAYING] -The view. -Yes, quite a view. -You mean my masterpieces? -(LAUGHING) Well, they're a little-- -Shocking. I -No, just a little startling when you see them all together. -(LAUGHING) Let's just say they're a commercial. Oh, Nanette. -Tom, I really must tell you, I know someone who's a-- -Nanette, look. That view, with the sun just so. For 8 years, I've been trying to paint that and I've never gotten it just the way I wanted. You can almost feel that glow. Oh, but I'm sorry. You were saying? -Oh, now, what was I saying? -You mean, I put it out of your mind? -Yes, I'm afraid you have. Oh. Washington Square. -Oh, yes. -Who did that? -Gillespie. -No. Not you. -You surprised? Well, what I mean is it's, uh, not much like your usual style. -It has no legs in it. Throws everyone. You like it? -I love it. -It's yours. -Who, me? -For you. -Oh, Tom. That's wonderful. -Oh, come, come. It's not that good. John, that's exactly what we need. A nice cup of tea. -Shall I brew it, sir? -No, no. I'll do it. I'll do it. -I'll do it. -Oh, you'd be surprised what a good cup of tea I can make. Ow. -I think you'd better let me do it. -Maybe I am a little out of practice. -Well, this helps. Mr. Gillespie, I don't believe you've ever made a cup of tea. -Miss, miss, you're very difficult to deceive. -You're not so easy. Now, go sit down. The kettle isn't boiling yet. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I really must be going. I just have to talk to you about someone who'd rather paint than eat. -Oh, oh. Hold it. That's good. Who wouldn't rather paint than eat? -Tom, I must go. I have to get back to Uncle. -Well, he'll probably be napping. -Yes, that's what I'm afraid of. Good bye. -There are 2 million Smiths in the telephone book, but if anyone calls me, I'm not here. Remember, my name is Smithh with 2 h's. Smithh. -Very good, sir. -Thank you. -You must meet Mrs. Smith. -Yes, I'm sure Mrs. Smith and I will get along delightfully. [DOG BARKING] -Pauline, let those dogs go. -Don't worry. They're going. -Guess who? Jimmy. -How do you do? -You meant to surprise me. Oh, how sweet. How terribly sweet. Jimmy [INAUDIBLE]. -My wife handles all my financial affairs now. -Jimmy. Remember the old Kitty Revere? Just a simple, naive girl clipping your cuticles. But that's all behind us. To the future, Jimmy. And then, when the Metropolitan Museum is asking for the first from the brush of Katherine Revere, you, Jimmy, will be the happiest man at the hanging. -I certainly will. -Hello, Pauline. -Hello. -Uncle in? -He's in there with Kansas. -Kansas? -Mon cheri, that twinkle in your eye-- -No, no, no. I haven't got a twinkle in my eye. Not the twinkle you mean. It's this one-- -Oh. That's it. Jimmy. [SINGING] -It's-- that's alright, Pauline-- -Alright. Sounds sorry to me. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Uncle. -Ms. Revere, my niece Ms.-- Ms.-- -Oh, little Nanette. Jimmy told me so many things about you. -Mr. James Smith? -Mr. James Smith is not staying at this hotel, madame. -Oh, yes. I know. I'm Mrs. James Smith. Were you aware-- -A Mr. James Smith is not staying at this hotel. Those were his instructions, madame. -Well, when Mr. James Smith does stay at this hotel, will you tell him that Mrs. James Smith will be back in a few minutes. -Ms. Nanette Smith, please? -What's the name, please? -Ms. Nanette Smith is staying with Mr. James Smith. Hello, Tom. -Hi, Susan. -Slight case of amnesia. Jimmy doesn't know he's staying here. -Well, it must run in the family. I gave this to Nanette and she left it in my studio. -It's been so nice meeting little Nanette, I think I'll stay and meet Mrs. Smith, too. Oh, Jimmy. What a divine picture of you. -(ANGRY) And very nicely framed. -Nanette was born in April. Her planetary influences were excellent. April 19. -I don't know whether it was the planet's or not, but someone deserves a lot of credit-- -Of course, it was the planets. Your parents have nothing to do with it. Nothing. -Really? -Now, look here. Will you get out of here. -Don't stop me, darling. -Uncle. -Poor, Jimmy. -Oh, you wolf in chicken feathers. -No, don't, Nanette. You'll just make her desperate. Nanette, this is the end. Oh. -This is what comes of lying awake at night worrying about your career and seeing that you can be taken under the wing of an artist, a great artist. -What great artist? -Gillespie. -Gillespie? Not the Gillespie? Oh, Jimmy. You darling. You darling. Why didn't you tell me you were putting me under the wing of Gillespie. Gillespie. At last, I will paint. -Astrologically, Aries and Leo are mad about each other. But a special effort must be made to like each other's friends, then everything will run smoothly. -I'll Remember that. -Do you hear? We shall paint. [DOG BARKING] -Darling, you darling. [DOORBELL RINGING] -Hi, Pauline. -Oh, Mr. Gillespie. -Mrs. Smith said I might deliver this personally to Ms. Nanette. -Oh, did you do that? -Mmhmm. -Nice. Well, you'll find her in there. -Thank you. [KNOCKING] -Oh, hello. -Hello. You left this, I thought I'd bring it around. Sorry, am I intruding? -Oh, no. Not at all, Mr. Gillespie. -Mr. Gillespie? -Mr. Gillespie. [DOG BARKING] -Oh, Tom. This is a very old friend of mine. -Old friend? -This is the biggest moment of my life, absolutely. -Well, any friend of Nanette's, is a friend of mine. -When do we begin? I'm ready. Do with me what you will. -Tom, you don't know what this means to me. -What means to-- -Uncle means that this is the girl that I, that is, we, were telling you is so interested in art. -Mr. Gillespie, I want to paint horribly. -That's easy. Particularly if you're a friend of Nanette's. -Oh, a very dear friend of little Nan's. -I'm sorry you have to leave so soon. -Oh, yes. Good bye. What a day this has been. And you made it all come true. Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy. Are you ready? [DOG BARKING] -Allow me. -If you hurry, you can catch the next elevator. -Oh, don't you worry. I'll take good care of her. And don't be surprised if the teacher should learn something from the pupil. -I won't be a bit surprised. -Mr. Gillespie, if only I had a successful [INAUDIBLE]. Then you could mold me. I promise you one thing, I'll work hard for you. -Oh, I'll be glad to look over anything you've got. -I'll even mix your paint. I may not look it, but I can do the messiest things. -My slate is wiped clean once more and never again. -That's right, Uncle. Never again. -Excuse me, sir, but would you like me to fix the flowers in Mrs. Smith's bedroom? -Yes. Let's do it together. -Uncle. -Oh, yes. Never again. -I can't seem to get the right expression on the fish. -Uh, this is the fish. -But still I feel I'm blooming under the touch of the master. -Good morning, madame. -Good morning, John. Hello. -Oh, hello. -Oh, alright, alright. I know that's all for the day. Dear little Nan. You know, I should be very happy to paint you, when I finish my fish. -That would be nice. -Tom is such a great master. I feel I should be able to tackle anything by then. Au revoir, maestro. Au revoir, little Nan. -The things I do for Uncle. Oh, Tom. You don't know how much I appreciate what you've done for Unc-- I mean for, uh, Kitty and me. -Not at all, not at all, but she is a bit of a strain on Leo for Aries. -Leo for Aries? Yes, I'm the Leo. I'm a bit of an astrologist. -Oh, that's funny. So is Auntie. -Is she? Well, Kitty could have been worse. -Could she? -Oh yes. You remember that Sonya something or other that was auditioning for Bill Trainor up in Boston? -Uh, yes. I believe I do recollect. Didn't she do something with a bubble? -That's the one, that's the one. Well, she got the job, bubble and all. Someone landed him with her. -No. -Yes. She's sure to kill the show. She's simply awful. To find Bill Trainor around rehearsals now, you've got to look in dark corners. [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] -Marvelous, Bill. Wonderful. -It is great. -Wherever did you find her? -Yes, Bill. Where did you dig around for her? -That's a long story. Oh, can I hear all about it after the show? -Sorry, can you make it tomorrow, I have a supper party this evening. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHING] -Pop goes the profits. -Bill, you look like Diamond Jim Brady tonight. -Thanks, I feel just like him. -And Jimmy, you look like the mouse that ate the cat. -A bubble dancer. You know, frankly, I didn't think she had a thing. -Nobody else did either. -Oh, but I-- -And here's to the girl who made it all possible. -Yes, here's to-- -Sonya. -Oh, yes. [INAUDIBLE] -To Nanette. BILL AND TOM: (SIMULTANEOUSLY) Dance? -Oh, well, truth is stranger than fiction. -Uncle, you promised me this dance. -Oh, did I? -It's your favorite tune, don't you remember? [MUSIC PLAYING] -When did I ever promise you a dance? -You didn't, but I had to get you away. -Why? Did I say something? -Just about enough to hang yourself with Auntie right there. -Oh, don't you worry about Auntie. Auntie and I understand each other perfectly. -Bill, what is all this Sonya mystery? I suppose she was [INAUDIBLE]. -Why, of course. -Of course. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Well, Mr. Stillwater. -Oh, my dear Mrs. Smith. How are you? -This is Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Trainor, this is Mr. Stillwater Sr. -How you doing? -My pleasure. -So, Jr. proved himself a chip off the old block, eh? -Really? -Particularly when it comes to getting a Smith out of a jam. -Jam? -The Stillwaters have been getting Smiths out of jams ever since the Boston Tea Party. -Is that so? -Why, Mr. Smith's great grandfather threw the first case overboard, if you remember. -If I remember? -You know, Jimmy, it looks as if Nanette will be able to pick her choice. -Well, they both seemed very interested, didn't they? -Yes. -I think it'll be Bill. -Why? -Can you see with the light like that? -The light's much better than you think, dear. -Because didn't you hear they all say that Nanette was responsible for Sonya Sonyavich's-- -Uh, the lamp. What happened to it? -Aw, right in your eye, darling? -Yes. It was right in my eye. -Did you know that Flirtle-Wirtle's friend was studying with Tom Gillespie? -(STUTTERING) Uh, I think, oh, darling, can I have a glass of water? -Mmhmm. She seems to know quite a lot about-- -Darling, this lamp's awfully bright, do you mind? -Oh, I'm sorry, darling. One would think I was giving you the third degree. [LAUGHING] -Good night, sweet. -Are you tired? -Oh, no. Just a little numb. -Oh, it looks perfect. Perfect. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DREAMY MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -It's a-- -Oh, I'm sorry. I fell asleep. -You did. -I was dancing. -Mr. Gillespie cannot be disturbed-- -Oh, I never disturb him, I inspire him. Hello, Tom. -Hello, Hutch. Ms. Smith, my business manager, Mr. Hutchinson. -How do you do? -I do alright, thanks. You don't do so bad either, Tom. Congratulations, your taste is improving. [LAUGHING] -Now, now, don't encourage him. -Pardon me, just a minute. -How about a special piece of work for [INAUDIBLE]? -No, not today, Hutch. And if I'm in the same mood tomorrow, nothing then either. -You dropped your apple, Hutch. -You didn't do that. -She did. -Oh, Tom. It's wonderful. -Why, it's just the thing. [INAUDIBLE] will give 5 grand for that. Why, they'll sell a billion cigarettes. -Sorry, I don't smoke. Now, we'll change the background on the color maze, dangle a cigarette from those ruby lips-- -It might interest you to know that it's not mine to sell. -No? -No. Specially commissioned by Ms. Nanette Smith. -Ms. Smith, It's almost lunch time. Will you do me the honor-- -Pick up your apple, Hutch. -Look here, Tom. Your clients have been yelling for something new and now, when you've turned out a beauty like this-- -It's not for sale, too bad. -You mind if I kick something on my way out? -No. Make it yourself, Hutch. -I will. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You weren't serious. -That spoiled it a little bit, it was to have been a surprise. -Nanette, he proposed? -Oh, no, Pauline. But he's painted the most beautiful picture you ever saw. -Not in the-- you know. -(STERN) Pauline. Are Uncle and Auntie in? -Yes, they're in. -Oh, Nanette. Will you meet Betty Bennet from Bridgeport. -Betty from Bridgeport? -She's a great friend of Mr. Stillwater's. -Oh, of Mr. Stillwat-- How do you do? How do you do? -We've been having some very dirty weather lately in Boston. -Filthy weather. -Another storm? -I'm afraid so. -That reminds me, did you boys ever settle that trouble with, uh, Syracuse. -Oh, yes. A very satisfactory and unexpected settlement. [COUGHING] -Looks as though she's had a shock. -Get a glass of water for her. -I'll get it, dear. -Will you? -You idiot. She doesn't know anything about it. -About what? -What you've come to see me about. -About me. -Have you finished with my curling iron? -Go get some headache pills? -Headache? -Yes. -Sr. thought it best for me to bring Betty here and settle the matter once and for all. -How much will you do it for? -200 thousand. -200 thousand? -Pay with cash for 48 hours. -This always helps me. Try it, darling. -Here, on page 72 it says, elevate the legs. -Elevate the legs. -She's very cute, isn't she? -The feet should be high, get some pillows. -Pillows? -Yes, pillows. -But they'd settle out of court for 5250. 5250? I haven't even got the 50. -5250. 5 thousand, 5 grand. Uncle, you can leave it to me. Your troubles have all gone up in smoke. Come along, darling. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Gillespie, it's a fine piece of work. -Thank you very much. You don't think there's too much-- -Oh, no, no. This is something you don't have to be modest about. -Do you think the owner will allow us to show it in London? -It'll ride a great reception. New York, Philadelphia, Boston. -John, Mr. Gillespie not in? -He'll be back for tea. -Alright, I'll wait. -You'll be staying for tea? -Mmhmm. Yes, thank you. Betty from Bridgeport. [MUSIC PLAYING] -(SINGING) I'm discontented, with homes that I've rented, so I have invented my own. -(SINGING) Somewhere secluded, our troubles diluted and [INAUDIBLE] unknown. -(SINGING) Far from the cry of the city-- [WHISTLING] -(SINGING) Cozy to hide in, to live side by side in-- -(SINGING) Don't let it abide in my dreams. -(SINGING) Picture me, upon your knee. Just tea for two and two for tea. Just me for you, and you for me alone. Nobody near to see or hear. No friends or relations on weekend vacations. We won't have it known, dear, that we own a telephone, dear. -(SINGING) Day will break and I'll awake and start to bake a sugar cake for you to take for all the boys to see. We will raise a family. A girl for you, a boy for me. Can't you see how happy we would be? -(LAUGHING) Oh, darling, have I got good news. -Oh, have I got good news. Your portrait's done the most wonderful thing. -Wonderful. Wait until you hear, I've really got great news-- -No, no, no. Me first. -Who's the head of this family? -Oh, well, you are. -You've heard of Galt, Beaver and Eisen? Well, anyway, they're big art dealers, connoisseurs. They're crazy about it, they want to exhibit it everywhere. New York, London, Boston, Philadelphia. -What? -Your portrait, of course. Don't you see, darling? It means the Gillespie girl is dead. No long a world of legs, lingerie, mouthwash. Now I can paint what I want. Nanette, you did it. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Be very careful with it. -What's going on here, Hutch? -Madame, your check. 5250. Congratulations. -What is this, Hutch? One of you're impractical jokes? Put that back. -Oh, Tom. Tom, I sold it. I didn't know. There's been a mistake, you can't have it. -Sold it? -Yes. Here, take it back. -Oh, I couldn't take it back. I've already started to build up a whole campaign around it. It was hers to sell? -Oh, yes. Yes, the project belonged to Ms. Smith. -Who bought it? -[INAUDIBLE]. -Perfect. I'll sketch in a cigarette dangling from her lips for nothing. -Oh, Tom. -You've got to leave it alone. Alright, boys. Take it away. -Don't worry, it won't be lost to posterity. You'll see it next month on the back cover of college humor. -Yes, I really didn't want to-- I [MUSIC PLAYING]Just-- -I'll tell her you're here. -I don't like the looks of it. She's all worked up and the other fellow's here. -Pauline, will you tend to your own business. -I will, but don't say I didn't warn you. -Hello? -Hello. -These are beautiful, Bill. -They should be studded with diamonds. It looks as if, "So Long, Sisters" is good for a year's run. -You don't mean it? I mean, after all, what did I tell you. -And so you did. So this evening, we're going to celebrate. -Oh, not this evening, Bill. I don't feel much like celebrating. -Say, what's happened to that laugh? -I guess I used it all up on [INAUDIBLE]. -Well, what do you say we go out and try to find it again, huh? -Alright, Bill. I'll be with you in 10 minutes. Where do we go? -Oriental Cafe on 66th street. -Oh, well, that one's just about right. -She jumped at a dinner engagement from Bill as if she hadn't had a thing to eat in a month. -Who did? -Nanette. -Well, what of it? -My guess is, she's been trying to help someone out of a jam and got in a jam herself. Oh. You're going to spoil me. Purple Passion. -Yes. Excuse me, darling. I just remembered something. -Purple Passion. -In that kind of a mood. -In that kind of a mood. -Oh, (SPEAKING FRENCH) let's go out someplace wicked tonight. -What about Fire Stand? -Oh, sublime. I feel like dancing tonight in the worst way. -Well, you get yourself a scotch there while I shave. -I think I'll have a little slug of something mild. -You'll find the gin on the table. Make mine whiskey and soda. A double whiskey and soda. Jim. KITTY (OFF SCREEN): Gin? I thought you said whiskey and soda? -Yes. Whiskey and soda. KITTY (OFF SCREEN) Oh, make up you're mind. -(WHISPERING) What are you doing here? Never mind What happened between you and Nanette? -She knew I put everything I felt about her into that painting. -What painting? -Her portrait. She sold it. -How much? -Does it matter? -Yes. Yes, it does matter. -5250. -[INAUDIBLE]. -You knew? -Shall I bring it in? -Oh, no, no. I-- I haven't any pants. -Cheri, la la. -(WHISPERING) What would you say, if I were to tell you that I've been leading a double life? -Good heavens-- -You wouldn't be so surprised. I've just been trying to spread a little sunshine. -Does Sue know? -Hasn't the slightest suspicion. -(SINGING) I want to be happy, but I won't be happy, until I make you happy, too. -Well, that's understandable. My husband likes to spread a little happiness. -Well, he promised me the moon. He lured me on. -Are you sure you're talking about my husband? -Yes, Jimmy. -I'm the only steady one in the family. -You don't mean it. -I do mean it. -Your drink is getting clammy. -Thank you. Where's Nanette now? Something about oriental dinner. Someplace on 46th street. -Oh, you mean that restaurant where you sit in booths? -Private booths. -Oh, that's where Bill always starts. -You mustn't let her out of your sight for a minute. -Don't worry. -Good luck. -Darling, do you like oriental food? -I thought we were going to the Fire Stand? -Ah, Mr. Trainor. -Evening, Sung. -Your usual dinner, sir? -Great. -And your usual booth? -Great. -You're a regular customer. -Oh, yes. Very regular. -What's this? -An old Balinese custom. -Do I have to do it? -Of course. -This is going to be fun. [LAUGHING] -Oh, this is nice. Just as you described it. -You take tea, Mr. Trainor? -Would you like tea, Nanette? -Mmhmm. -Tea for two. And Sung, have them prepare some of that duck, you know, your special dish. -With pleasure. -Say, say, will you please come back to Bali? -Sorry, Bill. Where do we sit? -Right there. With your feet tucked under. -Oh. Right? -Right. -Oh, yes. Can we have that booth? -You're the boss, sir. -But your shoes, sir. -Hm? Oh. -Well, very amusing. -Nice and private. -What do I do? Eat it? No. Just take it and crack it like that. -Tea for two, sir? -Oh, no, no. Anything but tea. -Make mine vodka with a dash of gin. -With pleasure. -Admires you. -I think I better crack mine. -I think we better change places. You're in the draft. -Oh, you do make the silliest excuses. [SOUND OF GONG] -Well, we've got company. -I'm sorry, I-- -Why Nanette, what an unexpected pleasure. -Well, it's unexpected. -That's what comes of not watching what you're doing. -Why, Bill. How are you? Nice seeing you. -Yes. Nice seeing you. -You must think we're perfectly awful. -No, just preoccupied. -I'm sorry, I really don't know how it happened. -You do, too, sweetie. You were leaning over much too far. -Well, uh, see you again. -Yeah. Glad you dropped in. -(LAUGHING) Isn't it silly? -(WHISPERING) Come on. -What do you say we, uh, go somewhere else where the traffic's a bit thinner, huh? -Let's get some fresh air. -Oh, well. It's the unexpected things that make life such fun. -Come on, Kitty. -Well, I just got set. Darling, you're so restless tonight. Little Nan was so surprised when we dropped in. Mr. Flirtle-Wirtle. Mr. Flirtle-Wirtle. -Ms. Revere. -My Fish. -My dear, you have arrived. -I have? Where? Le grande prix de l'exposision des artistes. (IN FRENCH) -Hey, hey. Snap out of it. -Hurry up, Kitty. -Moi? -Mais oui. -Mais non. Mais non. -Central Park. -Yes, sir. -Of course there's only 5000 restaurants in New York City and he had to pick the oriental. I think it's a conspiracy. -Of course it's a conspiracy. -Thank you. -Evening, Pauline. Is Mrs. Smith here? -Yes. And she's expecting you. -Good. -Hello, Jimmy. Jimmy, darling, have a nice walk? You know, you didn't tell me about little Betty. She's not up to your usual standards. Darling, you mustn't lose your touch. -Oh, Susan, I-- -You mean that you knew about him all the time? -But of course. -It's disgusting. You, you, you twerp, you. -Jimmy, she's sweet. You should have told me. -Oh, to think I have such a dear, understanding wife. -Yes. -I never meant any harm. I just wanted to spread a little sunshine. -Yes. That's what I told her. -It was all so innocent. You know, I'm as pure as a lily. -Yes, a harem lily. Sonya Sonyavich. Kitty from Kansas. Betty from Bridgeport. You Casanova. Right under my nose. You thought I was blind. You vest pocket romeo. -But daring, it was never on an emotional basis. It was purely intellectual. -I suppose you discussed the classics? If that trio ever curled up in bed with a good book , the book would curl up first. -Darling, couldn't we discuss this in the morning when we've cooled off? -By then I'll be sizzling at the Grand Hotel Reno. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Driver, see that? -Yeah. -Follow it. -Follow it? -Follow it. -Who does he think I am? -I believe they're still following us. -Oh, no, no, no they're not. Come on. Nanette, why don't you forget him? -Bill, it was nice of you to give me such a grand evening. -Oh, thank you. [RADIO PLAYING] -Shut that off, driver. -But-- -I don't care. I want to hear something. -You know, Nanette, that in the Nevada, you can get married, just like that. -Married? -Married. You don't have to wait for the license and in 45 minutes your in California on your honey moon. -Oh, that's convenient, isn't it? -Yes, I think so. -Did you hear anything? Brother, in my profession, it's unethical to eaves-droop. -Thank you. -You're welcome. -(SINGING) When skies are grey and you are blue, I'll send the sun shining through. -I can't get a wink of sleep. What's all the noise? -Quiet, Pauline. Hello, Mr. Stillwater? I want a divorce. -A divorce? -Yes, a-- Quiet, Pauline. -A divorce? Yes, madame. Who is speaking? Mrs. Smith? -Is this Sr. or Jr. speaking? Oh, no, no. You better have Sr. handle this. Unfortunately, Sr. Is out with an important client and we are unable to locate him. -Oh, but you must find him. I'm leaving for Reno tonight and Sr. must make that plane. -What is it? -Just the Smith family cracking up. -Cracking up? Blow me down. -Long distance, please. -Mr. Smith, if I could be of service? -Some writing paper. -Hello, Remington. Order 12 cases of champagne, lots of caviar and absinth. And double the servants' wages. Yes, that's right. I said, double the servants' wages. -Pauline, you know? -Everything. -Very sad. -Very sad. Oh, Mr. Smith, is it too late? -I've got everything worked out. I'm going to a little island in the Pacific, yes, Pacific and forget it all. -Very sad. -No, no. Mr. Smith will not be returning. MRS. SUSAN SMITH (OFF SCREEN): Never. -Very sad. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Thank you, sir. -Now, listen. You hurry up and get packed and I'll pick you up in 15 minutes. -Alright. I'll be ready. -Taxi. -Say, we seem to be following each other around. -Yes, we do. Don't we? -Say, that reminds me. -What is this? A hold up? -No, it's a kidnapping. -Oh, now look here-- -Now, you look here-- -Pauline, don't tell Nanette yet. -No. [DOOR BELL RINGING] -Pauline, I'm eloping. -Eloping? -But not a word to Uncle and Auntie until it's too late. -No, I won't. They've got plenty on their own platters. -Pauline, will you help me pack up? I've only got a few minutes. Can I get through without being seen? -Of all the crazy nights-- [MUSIC PLAYING] -What do we pack? Summery things. California. -California. That's better than Niagara Falls. -Oh, Pauline. -I'm so glad you didn't pick that fellow with the curls. My father said that curls were always a sign of weakness, but then he was as bald as a [INAUDIBLE]. -Did you get it? -Yes. -He didn't see you? -No. I got it out of Nanette's bedroom. -Pauline, give him this. -Oh, Mrs. Smith. -No. Not now. Not until I'm gone. When it's too late. -Pauline. -Give that to Mrs. Smith. Not now. Wait until after I've gone. Until it's too late. -Oh, Mr. Smith. [PHONE RINGING] -Hello? Yes, she's here. Do you wish to speak to her? Alright. I got it. Hey. Just a minute. What did you say your name was? -Which one did you pick? -Oh, the right one, Pauline. -Well, the right one said he can't come back and that you're to go to the airport, straight in the plane, and then he will bring the tickets. And he's using the name of Brown to avoid publicity. -Oh, thank you, Pauline. -Don't thank me, I think you're making a mistake. -Oh, yes, well, will you see that this not reaches Mr. Gillespie, but not until I'm gone. Until-- -I know, until it's too late. [MUSIC PLAYING] ATTENDENT: All aboard, flight 7, west bound for [INAUDIBLE]. As you board the plane, please give your name and your host. All aboard, please. -Mrs. Susan Smith. -Oh, good evening. You're going to Reno. -Is Mr. Stillwater booked on the plane. -Yes, he is due to board. -Good. -Ms. Nanette Smith. -Oh, yes. Nevada and then Los Angeles. Mr. Brown has your ticket. -Is he-- -Yes, he's aboard. -Oh, thank you. -If you don't wish to retire at once, you may take any. -Thank you. -James Smith. -Where to, sir? -The Virgin Islands. -Change planes at Los Angeles. -OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Alright, I'll see that it gets to them. -Oh, are you sure Mr. Brown is aboard? -Yes, he's in his bed. -In his bed? -Well, I think he's a little afraid of being air sick. Quite common. Nothing ever really happens. -Now, if you'll take your seat, I'll help you fasten the safety belt. -Mr. Smith, would you care for some gum? -Nanette. -Auntie. What are you doing here? -What are you doing? -I'm eloping. -Good. I'm getting divorced. -Divorced? -Oh, yes. Your Uncle turned out to be quite a bluebeard. -No. -I've already combed 3 out of his beard, so I'm going to Reno and get him shaved. Now, never mind about me. You're going in and I'm going out. Come here, darling. Congratulations. Where's the groom? -He's in bed. He's not feeling very well. -Probably a little nervous. -This is for you Ms. Smith. And you, Mrs. Smith. -Jimmy. -Tom. -For you, Mr. Smith. -Sue. -Hostess? -Yes, madame. -Is there anything leaking? -I don't think so. -Ms. Smith, Mr. Brown would like to see you. -Thank you. -Brown? -Bill. -Bill? -Where is he? -Oh, he's in his bed. He's still scared of being air sick. -Air sick? Looks as if you picked a lemon, too. -Ms. Smith will be in in just a moment. -Oh, Bill. What's the matter? -I don't know. I feel hot and cold all at the same time and I feel like ice. -Well, what can I do? -Well, a hot water bottle might help. -Hot water bottle? -Auntie. Have you a hot water bottle? -Hot water-- -He's got cold feet. -How romantic. -Oh, we'll you see, there may be some complications. -Try the hostess, darling. -Bill, I'll see the host-- -Well, hello. -Tom. What are you doing here? -Well, it's rather a long story. You see-- -He's the complications. -But Bill, we're practically married or something. -Heck, I know, but I couldn't leave Tom behind. You see, he loves you, too. I made him admit it. -Oh. You made him admit it? -No, but it was easy. -Oh, well, let me tell you something. I'm getting right off this plane this very minute. -You can't. -Nanette. -Oh, so sorry, Aunty. You can leave it to me. Everything will be settled. -Settled? And I've lost my Jimmy. -Oh, don't cry like that, Auntie. -It's the only way I know how. -Uncle, she's divorcing him. -Divorcing him? -Divorce? -Oh, Sue. You can't do that. -Of course you can't. You've got to forgive him -Forgive him? And he's hundreds of miles away. It's all my fault. I didn't understand it. He just wanted to spread a little happiness. -Oh, that's right, Auntie. You must forgive him. -If he were here right now, I'd throw my arms around his neck and ask him to forgive me. -Susan. -You weasel. Following me, eh? -But darling-- -Don't "darling" me. Mr. Stillwater. -Hey you. -Hey. -I've been counting sheep and you scared away over 300 with your racket. -Oh, I'm sorry. Mr. Stillwater? Mr. Still-- -Mrs. Smith, I'm afraid you're disturbing the other passengers. -I'm sorry, darling. I'm looking for Mr. Stillwater. -Oh, darling, we must save Uncle. -What? Again? -Oh, Auntie, you must forgive him. -I wouldn't forgive him if he came crawling to me on his hands and knees. -But still, think of his virtues. -He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink-- -No. He saves himself for the big things. -Bill, I was only trying to spread a little sunshine. -Yes, I know, Jimmy. But you laid it on a bit too thick. Get back in your tee pee. -Mr. Stillwater, will you serve the papers? -My dear Mrs. Smith, you have no grounds for divorce. -No grounds? -No. Until marrying you, your husband had a surplus of happiness. So he disposed of his surplus happiness to less happy children. -Children. Did you ever meet Sonya? -Yes. A sweet child. Who tonight was [INAUDIBLE] as comedy queen of Broadway, to wed the eminent Greek professor, [INAUDIBLE]. -And what about Kitty from Kansas? -At this moment, being joined in holy matrimony to the curator of many museums, Mr. Flirtle-Wirtle. And tomorrow, she will be hung at the Metropolitan Museum. -Good. -974, 975, 976, 977-- -And I suppose Betty from Bridgeport is a sweet little soul-- -Mrs. Smith, I must ask you to speak with respect to the wife of one of the eminent members of the legal profession. -My foot. -No. My wife. -Your wife? -Hello. -There she is. -Betty Bridgeport. [LAUGHING] -Why don't you go to bed? -(WHISPERING) Why don't you go to bed? Good night. -(WHISPERING) Good night. -(WHISPERING) Good night. -(WHISPERING) Good night. -(SCREAMING) Good night. ALL: (SCREAMING) Good night. -You've been wonderful, both of you. Thank you. Tom, as you-- -And particularly Bill, you know, he-- -Oh, why of course. I knew it all the time. -A radio for Mr. Smith. -I'll take it. Thank you. -Radio for you, darling. Fluffy from Frisco. Mr. Stillwater? Mr. Stillwater? Mr. Stillwater? [MUSIC PLAYING] -(SINGING) I want to be happy, but I can't be happy until I make you happy, too. -(SINGING) Life's really worth living when we are both giving. Why can't I give some to you? TOGETHER: (SINGING) When skies are grey and you say you are blue, I'll send the sun smiling through. TOGETHER (OFF SCREEN): (SINGING) I want to be happy, but I can't be happy until I make you happy, too. [MUSIC PLAYING]
