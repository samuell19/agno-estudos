The Charterhouse of Parma "Principality of Parma" Halt! Monsieur, I have the honour to wish you a good day. The honour is all mine. You would oblige me by giving me a napoleon. (gold coin). If all your colleagues had your courtesy, to be murdered would become a pleasure. I said one napol?on. I shall return this trifle to you if they don't hang me before. You think I'm mad? By the way, you're not mistaken, I am mad. I'm in love. I'm madly in love with the most wonderful of women. This tells you how hopeless my love is. Monsieur, I admire you. I've known many pretty women... but still I prefer a ride on a beautiful horse. - You're going to Parma? - I am. You'll see her, you'll fall in love with her too. Impossible to see her and not fall in love with her. But why am I telling you this? By the way, who's the man I'm indebted to? If you insist. Well, you owe one napol?on to the Marquis Fabrice del Dongo. A relative of the Duchess of Sanseverina? Yes, I'm her nephew. Excuse me, I haven't introduced myself. Ferrante Palla, a free man. Delighted. In times like these, free men have to go into hiding. Sad times, Monsieur. Excuse me. I used to be a doctor in Milano. I have conspired against tyranny, I've been sentenced to death and I've escaped to this place. Alas! You see over there? That's Parma. The Farnese Tower. Italy's most sinister prison. The Prince Ernest IV is a monster. The liberals are hunted down, bound in chains, hanged. But one day the martyrs will be revenged. I'd like to be of service to you. The only service you could do me, Monsieur, would be... not to mention me to the Duchess of Sanseverina. You're very quiet, my dear Gina. Are you worried? No. Do you know what they say at court about the Countess Balden? - The one who is always sleeping? - Yes. They say she leaves the imprint of a pincer on the chairs she's sitting on. This is funny... if one is in the mood. I'm boring you with this court gossip. You don't. It's only that I'm worried because of Fabrice. I hope he hasn't had an accident. He should have been here three days ago. This delay isn't normal. Not normal? On the contrary. From Naples, it's a long way. But that's the point. If Fabrice had traveled by carriage I wouldn't have worried. But on horseback he might have a fall, meet some disagreeable men. Reckless as he is, trusting everybody... perhaps attacked? By brigands! Do you really believe those stories about brigands? But after all, that poor child all alone on the roads. But Gina, Gina, listen to me. But the child is 23 years old. So what? A child will never grow up for his parents. You're not his mother. I'm not, but I've replaced her. The orphan was six years old when I took care of him. And when I close my eyes... I see only a child. What crime have they committed? I know nothing, Monsieur. In trade, the less one knows the better. They've committed the worst of all crimes. The crime of disliking the regime. They are locked up because of that? Parma is one of those states where even in the streets you're in prison. Madame la Duchesse! Fabrice! Gina! At last! I was crazy with worrying. I imagined all sorts of bad encounters. No, I only had sympathetic ones. So that's why you're so late. Let me look at you. This is my Fabrice. Count Mosca. Prime Minister to His Highness Ernest IV, and my great friend. I hope to become yours too. I feel honoured, Your Excellency. Don't be formal, we're not at court. I live my life as a character out of a comedy. And the priests taught me that all is but a comedy in this world. excepting the religious comedy, of course. I see, you've a malicious turn of mind. I may be young, but I despise hypocrisy. All those courtiers abasing themselves and this war based on smiles and bows. ? propos of war, I don't advise you to mention your trip to Waterloo. It wouldn't amuse the Prince. Ah, Waterloo. I saw so little of the battle. But at least, I met seen some real men. Around the Prince I expect to see only puppets. But this is a serious accusation you're making, young man. I'm afraid you won't be a success at court. You have the annoying habit of saying what you really think. You're horrible. He only arrived a moment ago! True. You must be exhausted. Not at all. But I look like a highway robber. Ch?kina! Show the Marquis to his room. Good-bye. So, you like my Fabrice? Yes, he's perfect. But you were always talking of him as if he were a child. The child has grown up. Will you still care for me now? They say that love gives "esprit" to the fool. I'm beginning to think that love turns men of "esprit" into idiots. I adore you. It's time for me to become again His Excellency, the Prime Minister. Till tonight. Come in. Are you satisfied? You haven't changed. And yet you're changed. You're another man. After all, you're a man. I really like His Excellency, you know. He's not the serious type, but... He would have been a prime minister much earlier if he'd wanted to look serious. But let's talk about us. About yourself. How long did you stay in Naples? Four years. Four years. And why didn't you write more often? Because you've had far too much fun to worry about me. I'd like to see you with the Jesuit priests, studying Greek and Latin. You'd realize how much fun that is. But one must learn Latin if one wants to become a priest. Once you're a priest... Count Mosca David will soon have you made Bishop. Your Grace. Is it already one month since Fabrince came here? More than a month and a half, my dear. His presence has obliterated time for you. But I've forbidden Ch?kina a 100 times... This is my face cream! Pardon. Isn't he adorable? - Who? - Fabrice. Ah, Fabrice. It seems he's the only one who counts for you. You live only for him, I can't see you alone any longer, you're always going out with him, you never leave his side, you show him off everywhere. I want him to have a brilliant future. A future! As to myself, I have a brilliant past. You're rather tragic today, my friend. I'm not blind. But you're youth itself. Whereas I... My mirror tells me every morning disagreeable things. Wrinkles, the eyes fatigued, a tired complexion... And Fabrice's complexion is of a freshness to despair of. You're marvelous. So, we're leaving? No, I'm not ready. You have all the privileges at court, my dear. But the Prince would never tolerate it if I keep him waiting. Especially on a day like this. We'll see you at the palace. But what are you doing? You were looking fine. My deepest respect, Chancellor. My compliments, General Conti. Are politics going the way you desire? The earth is still turning round, General, that's the main thing. And how's the fortress? Are you satisfied with your prisoners? Mlle Clelia. Your Excellency. You've abandoned your dear solitude to descend into society. I was just explaining to her what an hounour the Prince's invitation means, especially on a day like this. But the honour is entirely on the Prince's side, General. Excuse me. Couldn't you smile a bit? We're not in church. I'm trying to, but it's hard. I feel like I'm in a cemetery. A cemetery! All those people only exist because of their dead. Their ancestors. At least be gracious with Crescenzi... He hasn't any ancestors, since this annoys you, he bought his title with sacks of grain and he's good enough to be in love with you. My dear Marquis, good evening. Good evening, General. I'm glad you came, even though you despise these festivities... I told her she'd meet you here, my dear. And I'm not a man of the world either. Then we'll keep each other company in this desert. A newcomer. The little Conti girl. The prettiest girl of Parma with the richest man of Parma. They're made for each other. Good evening, Governor. Allow me to pay my respectful compliments to Your Highness. - Thank you. I am delighted to meet you, Mlle. Your father is a great soldier. What an exquisite woman. That Conti is the king of fools. The girl isn't ugly. She's a bigot. Pardon, Monseigneur. If the Prince were here he'd tell me again that I only open my mouth to utter stupidities. Charmed, Ambassador. ? propos, where is the Prince? He's late. This is astonishing! Especially on a day like this! Your Highness, there is absolutely nobody in here. But it seemed to me I heard some breathing. All security measures have been taken, Your Highness. You mean that I'm trembling for nothing! That I'm behaving like a cowardly little bourgeois? But is isn't cowardice, Your Highness, to take precautions one owes to one's people. They're a pretty lot, my people! But one must admit... Me, for instance, I receive anonymous letters every day. only this morning... What? What? Anonymous letters? This is amusing! I mean, this is despicable. And what do those anonymous letters say? Threats, filthy insinuations regarding my private life. Really? Filthy insults? And are you offended by those insults? I'd be offended if I were Prime Minister. But I'm only the Chief of Police. That's what I am. It's only because of Mme Rassi, she's only Mme Rassi, but after all, she's a woman. If they assassinate you, she'll be the widow Rassi. But this is about my own life! My own life! Everybody conspires. Everybody wishes for my death. Especially on a day like this. My birthday. It's true that one often has bad thoughts on one's birthday. I've had everybody observed, searched, preventively arrested ... I have taken... exceptional measures! Exceptional? So they may assassinate me any other day, but it won't matter to you! There's somebody in the closet! Another one of my precautions, Your Highness. What? What! You utter fool! I can understand your emotion. M. Rassi's guardian angels aren't very "rassurant". [reassuring] And that blockhead dreams of being made a baron! A baron! Never, do you hear! Never! And you'll never be Prime Minster either! That scoundrel dreams of taking over your charge of Prime Minister, you know. Come with me, Count. Your Highness. What is it? A petition from the convicts, on the occasion of your birthday. But this is the limit! All they think of is to depose me, and I'm to grant them pardon? So I am a tyrant, huh? Yet they dare moan at me! No pardon this year! Deliver the good news to whom it may concern, cr?tin! Yes, Your Highness. Try to smile, do it for me, for my promotion. Of course I'll do it for you. He looks as if he's going to a funeral. It's because the Sanseverina isn't here. Just imagine, my dear ... What stupidities are you going tell me now? Your Highness, I wish you a long and happy reign. I thank you, Ambassador. I thought you'd forgotten me. How beautiful you are. Especially beautiful. Isn't today a special day? You see, I haven't forgotten you. Adorable! Good evening, young man. Your Highness. So this is the hero of Waterloo. He fought like a lion. You exaggerate. I'm really asking myself if I've assisted at a battle at all. Yes. If Napoleon had won at Waterloo... I'd be in exile. Or I'd be dead. You're a Latin scholar, I heard. Latin? A little, Your Highness. The Princess will be delighted to meet you. She adores Latin. I'm afraid the Prince didn't like me. One cannot please everybody. What's the use of being a Prince... since you're still resisting me. But Your Highness! What about Mosca? I'll lock up my dear friend Mosca in the fortress for the rest of his days, it's easy. It all seems so easy to you, so everything seems simple to me. Here's the Grand-Duchess. - Tell me, cousin... - What did you say? I'll leave you now. We'll talk later. Gina. I'm getting more and more fed up with this ridiculous court. So am I, of the Prince's attentions. Let's leave together, abandon everything. I can only offer you an annuity of 15.000 pounds, but we'd be free. My friend, you know for whom I've stayed in Parma after my husband's death. Because of me. We got on very well for five years. We could wait a bit longer, surely? For Fabrice's future. He's an orphan. Yes, true. Fabrice's future. Look at him. The poor boy. He must be really bored. I'll rescue him. - Gina, but ... My dear Chancellor, you haven't answered yet when I asked you about the Saint Alliance. I am for a peace treaty that leaves an open door. To war. Thank you for rescuing me. I'd like to leave with you, getting away from all those phantoms. The Sanseverina is carrying herself like a Queen. Yes, like a Queen-Mother. The little Del Dongo might be her son. Incestuous! Let's leave. Are you bored? But one doesn't go out in society just for fun. Let's go home, please. I wish you a long and happy reign, Your Highness. May Heaven grant you good health for a long time, Your Highness. Please accept my most ardent wishes ... At ease! Turn left! Present arms! Present arms! Arms down! Turn left! Shoulder arms! Forward march! What kind of an appearance is that! You call yourselves soldiers? Some carnival! My congratulations. And you too, you're laughing! Fool! You think life is beautiful? - Sure. - Then don't laugh! Intolerable! Everybody is amusing himself. What about me? Me, who is the absolute master! Do I have my profile on the coins? I'm bored. I'm bored. - You're ready? - Yes? If you don't want to be hanged, never forget that you know neither to read nor write. Write. Monsieur le Comte. No, no, wait... Monsieur Mosca. One may be a great minister... but nevertheless be unfortunate in love. Don't laugh! It distresses me to announce to you, in case you still ignore it, that you're a cuckold. Don't laugh! What was I saying? That you are a cuckold. Cuckold. It's normal. The little Del Dongo is only 23 years old and you're older than 50. Underline! 23 and 50. That's enough. Sign as ... "a friend of the truth". Add a P.S. If I were in your place I wouldn't allow the lovebirds to carouse all over the place... in the country... in the theatre Lout! opera aria ??? The letter is taking effect. Which letter, my dear? Don't talk nonsense. I haven't written a letter! I wouldn't know. Decidedly, you'll never say anything but nonsense. I'd like to... don't laugh - I'd like to live alone with you on a desert island. An island where you're talking walks won't remain deserted for long. You must have said this phrase to others in Naples. In Naples? Come on. You were in love there, at least once or twice. First of all, being in love doesn't mean one has to say something silly. And then, you see, Gina... I haven't managed to fall in love yet. My character has spared me those sublime follies. Yet, it seemed to me that Fausta... did manage to excite you. Fausta? Let's say she amused me, that's all. This is extraordinary! [Italian accent] That young man over there, he bears a curious resemblance to... that other man who used to follow you around and court you... in Naples. But you're seeing him everywhere. This is becoming an obsession, an id?e fixe. Don't be ridiculous. Why make the Count suffer for nothing? For nothing? You're right. We're being seen together far too often. You're looking for a pretext to get away from me. I'm not! But you keep on watching over me as if I were still a child. You must realize... But I do realize. Listen, Gina. Leave me alone. Listen to me. If ever that nincompoop has the impertinence to show himself below your windows... What if he did? Don't push me to extremes. I'm capable of terrible things. My poor friend. The only terrible things about you are your moustaches and your whiskers. ??? canzone serenade At ease, Your Highness, you might get hurt. You'll pay for this! Take a seat inside, Your Highness. The cold night air might harm your voice. You don't know whom you're dealing with. But I do, sir. The hero of the battle of Waterloo. Everybody admire the noble Seigneur Fabrice del Dongo. The hero of Waterloo. The man who helped Napoleon lose the battle of Waterloo. Admire the noble Seigneur Fabrice del Dongo. The hero of Waterloo. The man who helped Napoleon lose the battle of Waterloo. Open up, will you! Well, my little Cur?. [priest] I hope this has cured your desire to incommodate ladies who belong to another. One must never steal somebody else's property. I demand satisfaction for this, Monsieur. Satisfaction? Did you hear? The little Cur? wants to fight a duel. Which arms? The thurible? The crucifix? If you want to fight with bits of Oremus, in Greek or Latin... I admit defeat at once. With swords, Monsieur. I'm not an assassin. As you wish. We'll cross arms tomorrow. Your Lordship. How can I be of service? Prepare a good breakfast. The best you have. - I don't know... - It'll be breakfast for one only. As to the other one ... A shroud will do. The other person is... Monsieur. Time to trucidate this gentleman and I'll be sitting at the table. But Your Lordship! Seriously, you want to fight in the yard of this inn? I already told you I wasn't an assassin. I want it to be known that everything is proceeding according to rules. Hurry, be quick! Clear out the benches and tables! You, your family, your servants! Everybody out! Behind that wall. You'll be the witnesses. Is your soul ready to appear before God, my little Cur?? It is? Then... take up position. Not bad for a little Cur?. By the devil! They've taught you to wield the sword in the convents. So it seems. I have something to tell you, my dear Count. Don't worry, I'll be brief, I won't hold a sermon. I knew that one too. I'd like to tell you, my dear Count that I had the pleasure and the honour to make you wear horns. It happened in Naples. - In Naples? - Yes. And even though Fausta is a ravishing person I didn't intend to pursue that adventure. You may tell her, she won't believe you. But since you've offended me I'll continue to make you wear horns. You're distracted, my dear Count. Pick it up. Conclusion: Since you're stupid and mean, and since I desire to provide to the lady at hand a bit of freedom, I feel obliged to see to it that you won't leave your bed for several weeks. And receive, on top of it, the blessings of the little Cur?. You may serve breakfast now. Yes, Monseigneur. And fetch me a pen and some writing paper. Take that gentleman away. He's too ugly. Get going, all of you! Theatre Giletti - Farces and pantomimes - the illustrious dramatic artist GILETTI and... ... the ravishing MARIETTA" - With whom were you? - With my lover. What! You admit! But you're my lover, Pierrot. I meant you. You were still with Harlequin! With every breath you're lying. Watch out, Colombine! I'm not blind. That's a good audience! He's charming. If you treat him right, he'll cover you with jewels. And I hope you won't forget your good old Manamaccia. There he is. I'll break your back, do you hear! I'll turn you into a bedside rug. Take that! And that! I'll spit in your face. So you want to make me wear horns, Colombine! Then, I'll take revenge! Excuse me. You slut! You expect me to believe that individual only applauded you because of your talent? I'm watching you! I'd like to see her again. That won't be easy. Giletti is worse than a tiger. But I only wish for the child's happiness. And Marietta already likes you a lot. Let me manage it. Bring us some nice presents. We other women adore pretty things. Do you like it? I've never seen anything so beautiful. But I don't want you to imagine ... It distresses me when that old woman asks you for money. But I'm not imagining anything. Giletti's on his way. He mustn't know that you're here. He's furious. Save yourself, he's capable of killing you. But I couldn't leave Marietta... I beg you, if you leave I won't get hurt, but if you stay ... save yourself! Alright, I'll leave. This is the first time a Del Dongo leaves through a window. Leave us. What is it? I'll kill the little gentleman, do you hear! I'll kill him. This is Marietta. And her lover. The illustrious Giletti. But the girl isn't bad at all. And you really think Fabrice is in love with her? Alas, he is, Your Excellency. A Del Dongo! I'm paying you to report on the Duchess' nephew. Not to comment on him. Excuse me, Your Excellency. On the 7th, M. del Dongo gave Marietta a bracelet. On the 8th, a Cashmere shawl, which caused Giletti to create a scene that ended with him slapping her face. And yesterday he left to visit the ruins of Villegia. He left alone? Alone, yes, Your Excellency. But 2 km beyond Parma, Marietta was waiting for him and got into his carriage. Leave me now. I'm delighted. - Delighted? - Delighted by your services. Get out. Hurry. Guess what I've just learned. I'm desperate, Fabrice has started another love affair. At least, Fausta was an actress. But now he's besotted with some cabaret girl. You don't say! A sordid little love affair. Maybe just another of his whims, like with Fausta. I can't bear to see him lower himself to such a degree. Come, come, my dear, calm yourself. If he were the son of a bourgeois, he'd lower himself. But he's a nobleman. And then, what can we do about it? The child has grown up. Could you ask that troupe of comedians to take their talents elsewhere? One doesn't refuse an entreaty from the Prime Minister. Still, we'd need a pretext. So what? Fabrice's life. Isn't that enough for you? Fabrice's life? What's it got to do with it? But the girl has a protector. Giletti, the troupe's manager, a dangerous man. He's sworn he'd kill Fabrice. The words of a comedian. But don't you understand! I'm beside myself with worries. Fabrice has left for a few days with that Marietta, I'm sure of it. So tonight or tomorrow, they might bring him back to me with a knife in his chest. Here, let me make you a present of this medallion. You'll surely go to hell. I'd go there too, just to be with you. But it'll be tiresome when we meet Giletti there. Let's not talk about him. Let's go back to Parma. No! Not to Parma! They'll arrest me. They won't. He attacked me. I'll make a statement and they'll believe me. No, they won't believe you! Let's run away, anywhere, but not to Parma. They've seen us. I beg you, let's run away. There's the border. On the other side of the Po there's Austria, where we have nothing to fear. - You'll cross first. - No, don't leave me! But you know very well that you have a passport and I don't have one. You'll cross over first, I'll join you later. - What if they arrest you? - They won't. I'll join you soon. Drive on. Border Alarm! A man in the river. Everybody out! After you, M. le Marquis. You could have nicer to Crescenzi, I am a poor man, my girl, you keep forgetting... He has millions, he wants to marry you, so what you can possibly have against him? Nothing, it's just that I don't love him. You don't like to live in this house, you don't like to go out into society, I'm beginning to wonder if you even love your father. Hold on! Are you impressed because he's a Marquis? Marquis or not, he's just a murderer. I forbid you to touch me! We will do without your permission. Search him! What a way to behave! Wait for me here. Do you imagine this is a stable? Monsieur Chief of Police. M. le Marquis, what's happened? Almost nothing. M. le Marquis had a violent gesture. He has assassinated a comedian. I only acted in self-defense, Governor. That scoundrel attacked me. This is superb! A poor devil leading his miserable life. He has only one precious possession: a woman. Monsieur desires her. He takes her. It's only natural. He's a Marquis. The poor devil isn't happy about this. So Monsieur bleeds him on the spot, with a knife, like a pig. It's only natural. He's a Marquis. And the moral of it all: the poor devil was nothing but a scoundrel. And when I say the moral ... I won't lower myself to a discussions with a policeman. You know, it's not a discussion a policeman is interested in. It's a confession. So until I have proof... I'd like to know how you allow a Del Dongo to be handcuffed! You approve of this, Governor? Handcuffs? Indeed... Well ... it's ... let me see But the regulations are explicit: they prohibit the use of handcuffs inside the fortress. Take them off. I'm only obeying regulations. I have been ill treated and I shall inform the Prime Minister. Sure, sure. He'll get you out of here and thank you for making him wear horns. What did you say? Ah, but you're too greedy! When one has a Duchess one can sit pretty. The snotty-nosed brat! You'll see when you'll appear before the judges. The judges! They're not worth much more than you, those judges. The master and the servants alike, despicable, all of them! Did you hear this? You're a witness, General! You too! Your insults don't reach me but this is a public outrage to our Sovereign! Men have been hanged for less than that. You'll lock him up in solitary. And Grillo will be his jailor. Let's go. I am like you. I don't sympathize with policemen. I'm a soldier. Take this. It's not true. I'm not a murderer. I'm sure you believe me, Mademoiselle. My home. She's* marvelous. [the girl/the house] If you'll forgive me, the cells are over there. I'm sure you won't be with us for long. Please, Monsieur. I've had this old tower completely overhauled. And I may boast to have constructed a modern prison. You'd need a cannon to break those walls. One feels secure. You only remove one bolt and everything drops into the void. Brilliant. The most accomplished parts are the dungeons. I must admit I'm rather proud of the dungeons. Lepante ... Paverini ... Venti ... .. De l'Agua Varga .... Menotti... Bagliotti... It's the inspection round. The prison guard's hourly roll call. Even at night? Especially at night! This is where you'll stay. The guard will bunk here. And look at this: my masterwork! A cell on a suspended platform, made entirely out of wood. At the prisoner's slightest movement it squeaks and warns the guard. Check it out yourself. Grillo, what am I doing? You're walking towards the window, Governor. You're sitting down on the bed. You're getting up again, Governor. Well? I've designed this myself. What an admirable invention... I've come to the conclusion that one must be kind to the prisoners. So I don't leave them even with the slightest hope of evasion. No illusions, no disillusions. This is more humane, isn't it? One couldn't possibly be more humane. With your permission, M. le Marquis. M. Rassi. Ah, Prime Minister. I didn't realize. You've seen me perfectly well. So, you dare arrest the Duchess' nephew without informing me. A precautionary arrest. I'll speak to His Highness. His Highness hasn't arrived yet? But His Highness left very early this morning. Left? Where to? On a voyage. I see. Stefano ... Emiglio ... Fauxnu Gianetti ... Melpin ... Cavallo ... Bredi ... Barberini ... Mercini ... Present. De l'Agua ... Pontanna Gondenna Metcalfe Guada Bedocilla Mademoiselle's birds. The poor Mademoiselle. She's bored a lot. I too love birds. A small musical phrase which could be stopped with two fingers. So fragile. Unfortunately there are the regulations. What is he doing? Putting up boards in front of the window. Up to this height. So I'll no longer see the birds? You won't. The Governor thinks it's very beneficial for the health of the prisoners' souls to watch the sky. All that hammering, as if for a coffin. Something like it. They're putting up planks in front of a prisoner's window. This is horrible! Isn't it enough to be locked up behind bars, like an animal! The prisoners are criminals. Not all of them! - Some of them are victims. - Be silent! What is it? This concerns the little Del Dongo. He'll appear before the judges tomorrow. They have worked fast. They've realized that he's not guilty and they'll liberate him. I don't think so. He'll appear before a Special Court of Law. Meaning? Meaning that they won't bother about the Giletti affair. The Special Court is only dealing with political crimes. And politics... this case is fishy. Accordingly, the Special Court, considering the great youth of Fabrice del Dongo... and the name he bears, recommends to His Highness a minor sanction: incarceration in the fortress for 20 years. The tribunal hopes that the Prince, in his clemency, won't raise this sentence. We did the best we could for you. You're perfect domestics. Next case. Your Highness, this can't be true about my nephew! That condemnation to 20 years in the fortress. But this is impossible, 20 years, Fabrice ... This would be monstrous! But unfortunately he has assassinated a man. - But he almost got assassinated himself! - Calm yourself. But he hasn't been convicted for that. Why before a Special Court? Fabrice is no conspirator. He talks like one. He spoke contemptuously of my judges. You're calling those men judges? Wretched people just waiting to sell themselves. What did you say! Calm yourself. Let's forget about my judges. But your nephew has also said that... that I was despicable. As sovereign I have to crack down but... but as a man insulted... as a man insulted... I might pardon him. I cannot bear to see your beautiful eyes look so sad. Your Highness, I knew very well that your sense of justice... You know very well, Madame... that I... that I have for you... a friendship... Really, Your Highness? A friendship to which I'm desiring for some time to give another name. This is not the Prince speaking now. We'll give him back to you, your Fabrice. Duchess... I find you more beautiful each time. Look at this. Beauty and power have always made a pretty couple. Gina. So that's why you did it! To be able to make this bargain. What? What? - Your hasty departure was just a flight. - A flight? To give Rassi the time to prepare his comedy with the Special Court. And you promised me that Fabrice would be set free. But you've cheated me like a coward. You've acted like a coward. - You forget whom you're talking to. - I don't! To a coward. A coward. A coward who gets up at night to look under his bed! Be careful! Fabrice's life is in my hands... and the gallows will soon be erected! Come here! That was a great idea of yours, those 20 years of incarceration. You fool. Did you listen? She just spat in my face. But 20 years of dungeon requires much serious thought and... She won't yield. And all this is your fault. And I am to make you a baron! Say, you did not spare the garlic! There's enough to fling on their behind half a dozen duchesses. Tell me, have you ever seen a Chief of Police sent to prison? You'll see one soon. You in prison, boss? You're joking. I'm a nobody, but... if I can do something for you? I know what I owe you. You owe me your life, that's all. Give me something to drink. Oh boss, I'm happy to serve you dinner. Don't pay attention to the mess, I'm so seldom at home. Good wine is a comfort to a man's heart. Bonum vinum laetificat cor hominum. In secula seculorum - amen This reminds us the good old times, eh, my reverend father? No, I was only a sacristan. True. And man is nothing but dust. But fortunately dust can be watered. And this is a solace to many worries. Seriously, boss? Are you in trouble? Oh well, if they throw me into the dungeon, you'll bring me little delicacies. Speaking of dungeons, our little friend Fabrice... by now, he must be frantic like a rat in his cell? No, he is very calm. Such a nice boy. We don't want him to get sick. Although, you know, there are times when a man's misfortune makes others happy, right? Certainly. All the same, we'd feel sad if he died. He's so young. But one dies at all ages. And it takes very little. A few grains of arsenic. Isn't it true? Let the bells ring for a christening or for a funeral. The essential is that they're ringing. Isn't it true, sacristan? No! Not that, boss! Not that! Do you want me to tell you the tale of little red riding hood? - Once upon a time there was a little girl... - Be silent! This is a fairy tale. It's true, one also finds tales like that in the police files. The tale of a little girl who met someone evil. And the wolf devoured her. I beg of you. I wanted so badly to forget about this. What a joker you are... I'm sure this is among your most precious memories. What was her name again? Ah, Carlotta. The poor little angel. You scoundrel! You know very well that I hushed up the whole affair. Only, if I have to jump, you'll jump too. And at the end of a rope It's either Fabrice... or us. I'll do as you wish. Of course our little friend must die of an illness. I have some opium from P?rouse. It leaves no trace and is completely tasteless. I trust you entirely, master. But tell me, doctor... Will that illness last long? Whatever suits you best. It only depends on the dosis. One month would be sufficient. No more Fabrice. Then what will happen? The Sanseverina will leave Parma. No more Sanseverina. Then what will happen? Mosca will follow the Sanseverina. No more Mosca. No more Mosca. No more Prime Minister. The office is vacant. Prime Minister! I've had a royal dinner. Are there many sick men in the fortress at the moment? Really sick? About 10 men. See to it that the Lord will call some of them to His side. They'll have special food. It'll be easy. Perfect. And when a sick man has a seizure it's only natural for him to die. Nobody will be surprised. In fact, they'll believe in a sort of epidemic. One cannot conceal anything from you. Good night, my dear sacristan. Carlotta! Agliotti Venti Grillo d'Agua Vaida Claudio Fernandez Balla Menolti Gliotto Michaelis Eat quickly. It's no longer hot. Did you manage to finish your little job? Do you mind? Let's stick to the regulations. You knew about it? Why didn't you denounce me? I have a weakness for little birds and for young lovers. Don't get angry. Mlle Clelia has charged me to bring you a message. Clelia? To me? She's unhappy. Because you've been convicted to 20 years of prison. She's unhappy! You'll carry a letter to her at once. And tomorrow you'll be asking for a ladder. - Don't count on me. - It's only to write her something. A few lines. I'll transmit your answer to her by word of mouth, that's all. Thank you. And I'm not ungrateful. I'm not doing this for money. But for pleasure. I too used to have someone in my life, you see? She was ... a little girl. A little bird from paradise. So fragile... She died? The Lord called her to His side. Bon app?tit. M. del Dongo asked me to tell you that you shouldn't be unhappy. He's very happy in his cell. Since he can see you. My God. This is madness. No. He loves you. That's all. First of all, he mustn't... and it isn't true! The truth is, he's bored in this cell, so my presence distracts him. If he were free, he'd forget me very fast. If you could hear him speak, you'd believe him. But who am I next to a Duchess of Sanseverina? Mademoiselle, you're a little bird from paradise. So fragile. But those are not my words, but the words of M. del Dongo. Another dead? Who is it? A prisoner. He was very ill. But still it's sad, only 25 years old. Especially with such beautiful sunny weather. Drive by the fortress. The fourth in ten days. Who might it be? They don't even reveal their names. The moment he's dead he becomes one of us. Adieu comrade! You'll be revenged. Death to the tyrant! Death to the tyrant! If you call out I'm lost. I'm an enemy of the tyrant. Then we're allies. Faster. Faster. And turn right. But you are the Duchess of Sanseverina? Is it possible? You? Excuse me, I didn't introduce myself. Ferrante Palla, a free man. So you're the man I've heard so much about. He did that? Divine Grace. And I've begged him not to tell you. So you know that... that I have the audacity to love you. I don't think it's the right moment to... To the right, then turn left. I've loved you for years, Madame. What do I care if they arrest me... of if they kill me, since I'm near you. Do stop talking such nonsense. Again turn left. We'll go to the Count. They won't search for you at the Prime Minister's. Forgive my troubled state, it's been so long since I last saw beautiful white hands. In order to defend liberty, I live in the woods. I'm sure to die at the end of a rope. I know that your nephew too is a victim of the tyrant. My only desire is to help you. I can only give you my life. I'm offering it to you. The gentleman is a robber of the high roads and a friend of mine. I'm asking you to hide him for a few days. Monsieur, make yourself at home. Let me introduce myself. Ferrante Palla, a free man. I can't say as much. I'm only a Prime Minister. For a Prime Minister the word "liberty" is criminal. In days like these, liberty is a luxury one has to pay for. But don't you hear the knell! You're only talking about politics and ideals, and another prisoner has died. I pray it isn't Fabrice. Now now, my dear, let's be reasonable. Fabrice's life is the only pawn the Prince has against you. Therefore Fabrice is in no danger. All that reasoning. Each day another dead anonymous prisoner leaves the fortress and you want me to be reasonable! But we don't need reasoning or big phrases anymore! We need action! I can raise the people. All the liberals are on my side. We could start a revolution. A revolution? I can see you've never had a good look at the inhabitants of Parma. One cannot found a Republic without Republicans. Then let's help Fabrice escape. It's dangerous but it can be done. A man of heart may die perhaps, don't reject another man of heart who'll do anything to save him for you. I have friends who can provide for everything one needs to escape. But how to inform Fabrice? We'd need an accomplice in the fortress. I've already tried to bribe the guards. But their fear is stronger than their greed. You'll be taken to your room now. Show Monsieur to his room. I understand your anguish... and I'm in as much pain as you are, Gina, - but I assure you that Fabrice... - Be silent. Be silent, since you're incapable of action. Waiting... Always waiting... I would have moved heaven and earth to save Fabrice. But you gave me your word that he wouldn't be convicted. And now you're advising me again to wait. And he may already be dead. How unfair you are with me. I may well be the Prime Minister... but it seems to me to be nothing at all anymore. Rassi triumphs. And I can't find out what's happening in the fortress. The Prince avoids me since you've insulted him. I should have been more yielding, shouldn't I? You're nothing but a courtier with the instincts of a courtier. - Gina! - This is all your fault. If you had ordered Giletti to leave town, like I asked you, nothing would have happened. But you were hoping perhaps that Giletti might kill Fabrice. You couldn't believe such a thing! You abhorred him, you were jealous of him, it's true, jealous of his youth. Go away, I can't bear to see you any more, go away. This is gay, all these bells ringing. These are. But not those of the fortress. They only ring for the dead. Indeed. What feast are they celebrating today? The procession of Notre Dame de la Visitation. All the aristocracy will be there. You're not going? I'm not. I'd rather pray in your little chapel. Father... Why did so many prisoners die in the last days? I don't know anything about that. One might think those idiots conspired to die in a series. And to play into my enemies' hands. - Which enemies? - The Prince, Mosca, Rassi, everybody. They're only looking for an excuse to force me into retirement. Father, is this all you worry about? Your own interests? And yet, those prisoners are men like all the others. And what of it if they make you retire? Then the two of us would lead a sweet quiet life. That's it. To linger in a sort of barn, and you'll become an old maid. Didn't I tell you that I desire only one thing: to stay near you. Listen to me, my girl, I'm telling you all this only for your own good. If you marry Crescenzi... But since I don't love him. After all, he's a handsome man! He's rich, he has a million. He'll give in to all your whims. You talk as if I were on sale. Of course I'm only thinking of you. And you wouldn't even lift your little finger to help your father. All you do is say your prayers. Only, if one wants to succeed in life, one must visit the drawing rooms. But you only love solitude, you abhor good society and you refuse all good marriage prospects. You're nothing but a little egoist. I won't marry Crescenzi. You'll marry him, I'm telling you! And we're going to set the date for the wedding at once. Never! Listen, Clelia. There's a limit to my patience. You shall marry Crescenzi or I'll send you to a convent. Chose! I prefer the convent. Maria. Maria, pack Mademoiselle's things at once! You shall leave tomorrow. Do you hear! Tomorrow! M. del Dongo has asked me to tell you many things. Always the same things. I don't see him at his window any more. Is he ill? It's only that... in the last days he's been looking poorly. He has a bit of a fever but nothing serious. And then, I'm there for him. Oh thank you. Then I can rely on you. Only at the moment, with that disease spreading... one can never be sure... There are even people who say it's... some kind of poisoning... - Poison? - Not at all! No, more like food poisoning. But I'll be on the look-out. church choral ??? Over there. The Conti girl. Perhaps we can learn some news about Fabrice through her. A little savage who only leaves her house for church. I'm sure she knows nothing. And then, why should she be interested in Fabrice? For her he's a total stranger. Madame. I must speak to you, it's urgent. - You see, Madame.... - He's alive, isn't he? Rest assured, Madame. I was beside myself with worrying. I know that you love him. But I am very worried too. - Fabrice... - Fabrice? M. del Dongo has fallen ill. And I'm afraid. But what's going on in the fortress. I don't know, but there's talk of poisoning. Madame, you must do something as soon as possible. And it is you, the Governor's daughter, who says that. Clelia. Would you agree to help me? Yes, Madame. Don't bother. I'm staying. The General Conti is triumphing shamelessly! She is a perfect woman. Come, come, my dear, I want to introduce her to you. What an ugly gentleman. Yes, but what a ravishing fianc?e. My dear Crescenzi, you're going to marry an angel. An angel, that's the word. Crescenzi, you're going to take away from me what is my most precious possession. Excuse me. My congratulations, Mademoiselle. You've certainly earned this happiness, my dear girl. Thank you. Oh, Mademoiselle. All my best wishes, Mademoiselle. Are you still determined to help us? Mademoiselle. I'm not going to wish you happiness. Why do say this, Your Excellency? Real happiness demands silence. Sadness too. And I propose to raise our glasses... to one who is absent. Father! - The Heavens are punishing me! - Calm yourself, Clelia. Fetch a doctor, quick! - Quick! Quick! This gentleman is a doctor. He was just passing by, it's very fortunate. This is serious. He must be taken away from here at once! I'll come with you. No, stay, you have guests to entertain. Wait. The head mustn't hang too low. He's better now. He must rest now. Doctor, I hope it's nothing serious? Not at all, he'll be well soon. What is it? Come with me. Mademoiselle, I'm a friend of Fabrice. In this pillow there's everything he needs to escape. - Ropes, files. - Good grief! My father! This wasn't an accident? We couldn't be too choosy with our means, we've poured for him a bit of laudanum. But I'm really a doctor. I ought to have you arrested. If you do this... you'll murder Fabrice. It's not your father whose life is in danger. It's Fabrice's. Oh immaculate Virgin, you who are all purity I am ashamed. Look at me. My soul is ugly. I love... I love Fabrice. For him I've become a criminal, I've betrayed my father. All the same, I beg you to help me. Because they want to kill my Fabrice. Help me. If you save him I swear that I'll never see him again after this. I will never again look at him. A rendez-vous of love in this chapel... isn't perhaps very suitable, but... but Christ has said: "Love each other". Clelia. Clelia. I've talked to you so often in my cell and now that you're here I can only say your name. Oh Clelia. You're looking pale. You've cried? It was nothing. Listen to me. They are preparing your evasion. My evasion? But one needs wings to flee from this tower. Careful! But I don't want to flee. I am happy here. Before, I didn't know what it meant to love. I don't have the right to listen to you. I love you. And you too, you love me. I've become engaged to the Marquis Crescenzi. This isn't true! You could not betray me to that point! Don't torture me. So you're like all the other women. Fabrice, if you only knew... Is it for this announcement that you've made me come here? You could have left me the illusion... You're applying your father's theories: no illusion, no disillusion. Be silent. My father threatened to send me to a convent if I refused to become engaged. I knew that your life was in danger. I only accepted in order to stay near you, to try to protect you. You love me, and yet you want me to leave? But you must realize: they want your death! I'd rather die next to you than live elsewhere. If you die, I'll die too. Listen to me. I've met the Duchess, she's prepared everything. You'll promise to obey the Duchess? I promise to obey you. Very soon they'll celebrate my father's recovery, the guards will be drinking a lot. Take this. You'll escape tonight with this. And you'll join me later? An engagement is no marriage and can be broken. You'll join me later, Clelia? Yes, Fabrice. An engagement is no marriage. drinking song ??? - Who's that? - Another friend of the governor. What's happening? A miracle. The Governor has a friend, and what a friend! Come down and join us. There's a new delivery. That's it, we're coming down. Let's go boys, downstairs. Grillo, have a drink with us. Hurry up, get down. Everybody downstairs. Here they are. Well? Everything went very well. They've totally lost the sense of equilibrium and very soon there won't be a single one left standing. Thank you. One for the poor of the parish, if you please. Look, musicians! We're employed by the Marquis de Crescenzi to give a serenade to Mlle Clelia. Oh, this looks fishy, what are you carrying inside your instrument cases? Fire-arms? Will you dance with me, Grillo? Little bird from paradise. Yes, little girl. All this isn't quite regular. A guard must remain at his prisoner's side. I'll be back soon. No, let's dance. ??? canzone / serenade Crescenzi has arranged everything very well. You won't regret to have followed your father's advice, my little girl. You're always moving about. What's the matter with you? Nothing. You should go to bed now. You've been up since this morning, aren't you tired? I feel great. But I'll go and lie down a bit. To tell you the truth, I... all that music... Good night. Unless it's military music, of course. Feeling better now, right? Here. Don't be afraid, we'll soon be reunited. Let me look at you once more. No, I'm serious, I must go back up there. A guard mustn't leave his prisoner. I can't stay. - You're leaving us? - Yes, it's over. Fabrice. Lift him up, we're in a hurry. They're ringing the alarm in the fortress. Well? We've won, Minister. Yes, won. My congratulations! When the fugitive is caught, I order to hang him at once. I said, hang him, Minister. And I advise you to refrain from any comments. As to you, General Conti... My career is in shatters. My life is finished. The dishonour. Because of your treason. You little wretch. And I, the old fool. Wondering why you were so interested in the prisoners. Who's there? It's only I. Come on, don't let them defeat you. I shall never recover from this. Such a disgrace. Come with me. A General... thrown out into the street... like a beggar. Clelia, You know I'm not a courtier. I'm a simple man. And I say things in a simple way. Well... I was crazy with happiness. I thought... she likes me in spite of my money. God knows I would have done anything to make you happy. But I love you enough to understand a lot of things... and to guess the rest. So... if you wish, Clelia... you're free. The best proof of love one can give at my age is to know how to erase oneself. I'll be your wife... whenever you wish. The time is passing slowly for you, isn't it? But you'll be able to walk in a few days. I hope I'll be able to ride a horse. To go to Parma? You're mad. I haven't received any news since I'm here. But it would be suicide for you. Yes, I too don't care about my life, I could give mine as well. But for something useful, for a great cause. But there's more than just love. There's also liberty to defend. So what? There's the liberty to love. He's better, isn't he? You'll see, we'll make some nice excursions very soon. - Our Piedmont is so beautiful. - That's true. Are you in pain? No. Are you better like this? Yes, thank you. Don't think. It's over, Ernest, Rassi and all those puppets. I wasn't thinking about them. You are very far away from me, I can feel it. It seems you're still in that prison. I think I'll sleep a bit now. But shouldn't it be me to help you? Get in. Be careful with your leg! But I am. Do you remember our boat trip on the lake when you came here on a holiday? It seems like yesterday to me. Yes. - You're not cold? - No. Do you remember the fishermen? The fishing lines we raised secretly. But that was 15 years ago. But they are the same little bells. It's the same sound, nothing has changed. The fishermen have, they aren't the same. And this place, doesn't this remind you of something? You'd fallen into the lake. And you threw yourself into the water to save me, you thought I'd drowned. Yes. You loved me at that moment. But I've never ceased to love you, in the same manner. You've stayed my great and wonderful friend. Let's get back, shall we? Who would have thought I'd take such a sad walk with you on this lake? Ah yes, I'm your great and wonderful friend. But you're there, indifferent. I know what you're thinking. I've never mentioned her to you, haven't I? She's only 20 years old. and I... We must end this. But you're absurd. I'm not. You only think about her. It's only she who counts. And everything I say gets on your nerves, irritates you. Even when I'm silent you can't stand me anymore. Very well, I love her, I love her, I love her. Is it my fault? But Clelia is everything to me, everything. I can't live far away from her. No I couldn't! Every minute is an ordeal. You'll soon blame me for having saved you from prison. I do! I wish you'd let me stay there. But this is intolerable! You spend your life saving me against my will. Every time, at every step. You love is the worst of prisons. You dare tell me that! I didn't want to escape. I was happy in my cell, I saw her. And now... Now she will marry Crescenzi. You're lying! Do you imagine she's waiting for you? Crescenzi is nothing but a grain merchant. But he is the richest man in the principality. Jealousy makes you say that, but it isn't true. Perhaps it's been done already, you stupid fool. Fabrice! Well... What a ceremony it has been! I'm very happy, my children. Yes, I'm tired. One marries off one's daughter just once. Especially an only daughter. I'll leave you now. And now, Clelia I'll say good night to you. And good-bye. Good-bye? Yes, I'm leaving... on an inspection tour of my estates. I have many properties in different states of Italy. And they are immense. I'll be away for quite a long time. You're leaving on our wedding day? Exactly, Clelia. My friend. You'll think of me once in a while? You'll slowly get used to the idea that you're... the Marquise Crescenzi. And I'll let you know about my doings. You'll always know where you can find me... on the day you're ready for it. I'd like to kiss you. Have you all understood? You'll place your men as you see fit, you'll operate only when you're sure the coup will succeed. The fellow mustn't escape us. Let's go. If necessary, Your Highness, I'll have the whole town searched, but we'll catch him. And it'll be my pleasure to have him hanged, that pretty little Marquis. You know, he's sure to return to roam around my daughter's mansion. She takes a walk in the park daily. The old story of the moth who gets burnt by the flame. Be assured, General, that I appreciate your patriotic initiative. Here you are, ladies, attention, number, another winner. 31 wins. Ladies and gentlemen, who's got the 31? Ladies and gentlemen, the game continues, take your numbers. Take your numbers, each number a winner. Attention, 28 wins. I win again. Beautiful weather. Yes, isn't it. Won't you take your little walk in the park now? Why, it's cozy in here. What are you watching? Me? Nothing. Are you expecting someone? What a funny idea. I was only looking at the sun. The weather is magnificent. You should profit by it. This will surely please the Prince. What will? It's true, you don't know yet. The Sanseverina is within our city walls. She's come back? This will also be great pleasure to Count Mosca. Especially since he's in disgrace these days. Ah, our dear Prime Minister. The Sanseverina will raise him again in the Prince's esteem. You're sure you won't go out? What a pity to neglect such a beautiful sun. I've already told you that I don't feel like going out. Ah, the mail. It's for you. Your husband, as usual. With his mania to write you every day. I always think the letter is for me. But they're never for me. It's only normal. A general in retirement is finished. One doesn't write letters to the dead. Anything interesting? The Marquis has left Lombardy for Bologna. Always on the high roads. It's funny. Weird even. What is weird? As a son-in-law he might pass, but as a husband? He might have taken you with him, no? Husband and wife, they're made to be together. If he didn't like you... he shouldn't have married you. After all, do you think it normal? You're going out? Fabrice. So it's true. If they find you they'll kill you. I waited for you, you told me you loved me. You shouldn't have come here. You're afraid I might cause a scandal? But why did you marry him? Because I didn't want you to die. So I made a vow. I made an oath to the Madonna that I won't see you again if she would save you. My love. I have no longer the right to look at you. I want to die. So that's what it was. And I doubted you. Save yourself! They'll arrest you. Fabrice! No, let him go! Fabrice! Fabrice! Let him go! Let him go! I love you. Yes, yes, I love you. In the meantime he'll wriggle at the end of a rope. There is a God after all. So it was you? Now I see it all clearly. You knew that he had returned. That's why you spied at the window... It wasn't enough that I should be a jailor's daughter, I also had to be the daughter of the basest of all men: a squeak! You've arranged everything! You've prepared everything, you've turned him over to them. Go away, go away! I don't want to see you any more, I hate you... I hate you. Mme la Duchesse, I must see her. - But Madame ... - I must see her at once! They've arrested him? Yes. He must be saved. They arrested him near my home but it wasn't my fault. I didn't encourage him to return. But it's because of me that he returned. And because of me they've arrested him. They'll kill him. And I'm helpless. But you... Once you asked me to help you. Now I'm asking you. But you're not even listening. But it's not possible, you can't let him die! You too love him. You can save him, you can do anything if you want to. I've told you he'll die! He won't die. Let her come in. No, let her wait. Fabrice is saved. I'd like you to give this to your nephew. A gold piece? A napoleon he once lent me when I was a robber on the high roads. If I meet with an accident, and accidents may happen easily... Ferrante Palla pays his debts. Palla! How long it takes till daybreak. You'll have beautiful weather for your voyage. But the mornings are cold. One must take good covering. What time is it? Almost 7 o'clock. - Everything's ready for Madame's departure. - Very well Ch?kina, we'll leave in a moment. Once you've arrived in Naples, I'll terminate all my affairs here and I'll hand in my resignation. Two weeks later I'll join you. What are you thinking of, Gina? Excuse me. I've thought about Palla. Ah, the free man. We too shall be free very soon. I hope you'll forget Parma and her miserable little court very fast. Be assured. The Countess Mosca won't remember the Duchess of Sanseverina. Speaking of souvenirs... No thank you. I thought you held it in great affection. One always holds one's youth in affection. But one must let it go one of these days. One must end things. Growing old near you will comfort me. Madame la Duchesse. What is it? Well, what is it? The luggage has been loaded, everything's ready. I'll be down soon, don't disturb me now. What time is it? A few minutes past 7. That early? You're waiting for Fabrice? I won't see him again. What's the use? One may save a man from prison... but one cannot save him from himself. From the prison he's closing himself in. What do you think of Palla? He's really fortunate. The madmen are happy. In fact, it is the reasonable people who are really mad. No, what I meant was... do you think Palla is a man of courage? Present arms. Halt! Look at this! Turn left. This is how a free man dies. Long live liberty! Death to the tyrant! Long live the Republic! Do you hear this? No. Listen to those shouts. What's happening? The Prince is dead. Now I can leave. And you'll give this to Fabrice. From Palla. Let's burn down the palace. Long live the Republic! My poor sir. But it's of no use to come here, I've already told you. Madame is as unhappy as you are, but she cannot see you, as you know very well. I must see her, only once. Since I'm telling you that she cannot. Just once! Long live liberty! Long live the Republic! M. le Cur?! M. le Cur?! M. le Cur?! They've hanged me. Justice has been done. Don't be frightened, Your Highness. But this is terrible, M. Rassi, a revolution! No, just a touch of fever, that's all. But evidently, once it aggravates... Where is Count Mosca, why doesn't he do anything? But this is inconceivable, one must act at once, M. Rassi! It's only that... I'm not the Prime Minister. Prime Minister? Would you accept the office, M. Rassi? I? A commoner? If only I were... a baron... I'll give you my Riva estate and I'll make you a baron. Baron Riva? Do you hear? This is frightening! You know, Your Highness... the good people must take it out on somebody from time to time. But they're content with very little. Let them have their fun. Because... But what must one do? I have already taken some precautions, because of Count Mosca's negligence. and by tomorrow ... everything will be returned to order. What would I do without you, Prime Minister. In nome de patris et filii et spiritu sancti, amen. My brothers. I propose that we shall meditate together today... on a passage from the Imitation of Our Lord Jesus Christ. The passage where it says that nothing is stronger than love. because love comes from God. Lord, help me listen to Your voice deep in my heart... how sweet it is to love. It's you! Finally you're here, my love. Come closer that I may see you. I've made you suffer. How I've tormented you. God will punish me, but I don't have the force. How could I have made that vow? The Madonna didn't saved you, she did nothing. I've come to take you with me, Clelia. - Take me with you? - Yes. But this is impossible. Nothing is possible anymore. But this is monstrous, nothing is keeping us from escaping, being happy together... since we love each other. We couldn't be happy, Fabrice. One doesn't create happiness out of a cowardice. I knew you would say that. I've already made up my mind. I'm seeing you tonight for the last time. We'll be far away from each other, but our hearts are united. I won't see you again? Never again? No. We shouldn't, Fabrice. I don't have the right, not anymore. The others don't have the right. My love, could it be a sin? We could commit only one sin, the sin of not loving each other. Forgive me. I have perjured my vow. And I've betrayed all my duties as a spouse. And yet I don't feel remorse. But you wouldn't understand me. Prepare my baggage. I've decided to leave Parma today. Thus, while Clelia joins her husband the Marquis Crescenzi in Bologna... and the Sanseverina travels to Naples... where she'll wait for Count Mosca... Fabrice del Dongo will shut himself up for the rest of his days in the charterhouse of Parma. There ends the road to happiness of which Stendhal has written that one achieves it rarely and that its pursuit is well worth one's whole life.
