In all this world there is nothing so beautiful as a happy child. The forest of Burzee an age ago. They are coming! The leaders of the immortals are coming. Great Ak, they are here! You Sound Imps always forget who you are talking to. It's me, Tingler. Speak my language, please. Uh, sorry. So much to remember. The other day, I spoke in Alligator to a wood nymph. Uh, it's them, they've arrived. The leaders of the immortals, Great Ak! Good, hurry and bring them to the council table. Si, pronto, tout suite, hai, dozo. Do svidaniya. Bueno, si, d'accord, bye. jingle jingle 'Ah, good Queen Zurline .' It will be a truly unusual night. Yes, Great Ak. I wish you success. I must convince them or tonight.. ...will be Santa Claus'.. ...last sleigh ride. The immortals. Her Majesty, the Queen of the Water Spirits. 'The Lord of the Sleep Fays.' The Master of the Sound Imps. The Commander of the Wind Demons. 'The Grand Duke of the Light Elves' 'with their royal highnesses' 'The Princes Flash and Twilight.' The Protector of the Knooks. 'The King of the Ryls.' I bid you welcome. We are called here to discuss the man known as Santa Claus. A mortal who has won the love of the entire world. Tonight, when he returns from his final ride 'he will be visited by the Spirit of Death.' Of all men who have inhabited the Earth no other so well deserves to live on. A mortal? Live on? Nonsense. whoosh We have come, so we will hear you out, Great Ak although your cause seems hopeless. But come to the point. What is your desire? That Santa Claus be allowed to continue his yearly rides, his good work. But that would mean only one thing. Yes. To bestow upon Santa Claus the Mantle of Immortality. How shall I begin this story of the life and adventures of Santa Claus? At the beginning, Master Woodsman. Yes, the beginning. We live so happily here in the forest that we know nothing of the sorrow and misery that falls to the lot of those poor mortals who inhabit the open spaces of the Earth. It was a short 60 years or so ago.. ...an instant in immortal time.. ...that I came upon the babe abandoned in the snowy woods at the very edge of the forest. I left the child with the Lioness Shiegra. I ordered her to lie close to the babe and to give it her milk and to send word throughout the forest that the child should not be harmed. Otherwise, he would have been Shiegra's evening meal. Great Ak, what is a child? You were always as you are now, Necile as immortals will always be. 'And you know nothing of children' 'because there are none among us.' And there will never be. It is so decreed by our laws. Children. It would be nice to see one to hold one, just once. A child of man. A baby. The Lioness Shiegra guards the babe. I must wait and be silent. growl Surely, I can look after my young trees and the babe as well. What is it that has disturbed you, Great Ak? I feel a strange presence. Something that has never been in the Forest of Burzee before. Uh, Great Ak. 'It is the Lioness Shiegra.' She is beyond my control. growl I thought no animal was beyond your control, Peter Knook. 'Are you not the master of all animals in the world?' It has never happened before. Oh, Great Ak. Find room in your heart to forgive me. I have broken the law of the forest but please, let me keep the man-child. Let me know the joy and warmth of having.. ...this baby. roar Shiegra! Here! growl It's alright, Shiegra. roar Yes, I know what I told you. You are right to be angry. Please, let the babe remain. Here? In the Forest of Burzee? Where the human race has never yet penetrated? roar But the law, child. The law. The law's the law. Or it wouldn't mean anything, right? The law is made by the Great Ak. If he bids me care for the babe he himself has saved from certain death 'who else in the forest would oppose me?' I'd say you are fairly trapped, Great Ak. roar Agreed. She shall keep the babe, and the Lioness Shiegra will stay to protect them. growl What shall we name the babe, Necile? I will call him Claus. For in the language of our forest it means little one. Little Claus. Uh, it gets a bit chilly in this forest at times. Luck to you, child. Claus it is, then. toing Claus? Tingler is here for your language lesson. Hi, Tingler, uh, what's it gonna be today? Squirrel, bee songs, wood flower poetry, or elephant? All wrong, torto, incorreto, falsch,all wrong. Finch. Oui, MonsieurTingler. Not French. Finch! Okay, let's practice by the stream. Are all children like Claus, Queen Zurline? No, he is a very special child, Necile. And I'm sure he will grow up to be a very special mortal man. I miss the babe I once had. You must say goodbye for a time to Necile and her sisters, Claus for you are going to accompany me on a journey through the world. - The world? - 'Yes.' Where mortals, not unlike yourself, live. We immortals are few, but mortals are many. I would like to see the mortals very much. Go then, and be back by daybreak tomorrow. 'Great Ak called me a man.' 'What does that mean?' It is the name mortals use for a boy who has grown, as you have. Goodbye, Necile. There is another word the mortals use. - Mother. - Mother? What does it mean? One who has a child a mortal child who grows and becomes a man. Are you my mother? I would like very much for you to call me that if only for this one time. Alright, then. Goodbye, mother. growl Hold tightly to my belt for we are going to journey through the air and circle the world. Hold fast, Claus. When we land, we shall become invisible to all whom we meet. 'One measly cart?' The Lord of the Manor shall hear of this. But, Squire Rushwell, it's been raining for a fortnight and this is the first day we could harvest. You'll work in the dark tonight by torchlight 'and without your supper, 'til the quota's made!' Put it back. One more trick like that, and you'll find yourself back at the orphanage, you will. Wait, it's only a turnip. 'A single, miserable turnip.' Here, take it. 'It's no use, Claus.' They cannot see us. So, these are mortals? Do they all act this way towards one another? It seems so cruel compared to our world. Man's inhumanity to man, Claus. And I'll be back when you least expect it. So be warned! Do all mortals live like this? Come, you shall see. Squire Rushwell tells me the serfs are acting up again. Hm. One of the little brats tried to steal one of my turnips. - Imagine! - Hm. He only took it because he was hungry. 'It's fine for you. You've got everything you need.' Surely, we can do something. 'And I hear that another scamp wants to learn to read.' - 'Imagine!' - 'Hm.' Next, they'll be wanting to write. You don't want to learn to read or write 'do you, Jameson?' Of course not, sir. 'Soon, they'll start dreaming' 'of another kind of life.' And that would be the end of all this. We can't afford that now, can we? Hm. Sooner or later, they'd want what we have. This business of being a mortal, I don't think it's for me. But you are a mortal, Claus and you will remain one until you are just a memory to immortals like Necile. I don't understand. 'Come, you will understand in time.' Hey. Hey. - Hey. - Hey. Are they playing a game? No, they are training to be samurai warriors who will fight and, if necessary, die for their Lord. 'That man is their teacher.' Hey. Hey. Yah! Stop, don't hit him! There is nothing you can do, Claus. He's just a little boy. He is learning to be an adult. To survive in the difficult world of mortals. But at his age, he should be like I was laughing and playing. Ah, Claus. If it were only that simple. Everything is so different from our forest. Uh, show me more, Great Ak. - I wanna learn. - Come, then. Where to now? To a place of trade. 'Why are those children holding out their hands?' 'They are homeless, Claus.' They have no one to care for them. No Necile, no Shiegra. And they have no money to buy food. 'They depend on the generosity of others.' I would like to help them, Great Ak. There must be something I can do. Clank clank And men go to war, Claus. They fight amongst themselves for what are known as causes. - Good causes? - Sometimes. 'More often, they are not.' 'War.' Men kill each other when they disagree? What is man's use? Why is he here? Why is he born at all? To leave the world in some way better than he found it. Great Ak, how can I do that? You must follow your star as others have before you. And try to bring a measure of love and joy to the world. 'Great Ak showed me all the places in man's world.' My world, it's a hard and cruel place but it's where I have to live. Well spoken, young Claus. I will never forget what you've given me, Necile. Mother, I'll never forget you. You will come back to visit? If you'd let me, I'd like that. Call upon me whenever you have need, Claus. - Me too. - Anytime. If you're feelin' blue, we'll color you pink. And we shall be here as well to assist you. Goodbye, son. Goodbye, friends. Goodbye! Good luck, Claus! Guard his footsteps well, Shiegra, Tingler. You're both coming with me? Si, oui, d'accord, bueno, si. roar I feel like something or someone is guiding my steps. That I know exactly where I'm going. Well, we're just on the edge of the valley now. Just a little further, by my calculations. Does this valley have a name? Yes, shh, we are almost upon it. Listen. Attenzione, ascolta. 'Neige, schnee, nieve,snow!' - Snow? - 'Yes.' In the Laughing Valley of Hohaho, there is always snow. Because it is always winter. The Laughing Valley of Hohaho. I like the name. I like the place. I like the snow. Let's make camp. There. chime chime jingle jingle Claus, Claus, get up, you have.. growl ...guests, look! Thank you all. I promise I'll make you proud of me. miaow Now, don't be jealous. You've got to learn to live together with Blinky, Shiegra. Necile sent Blinky to us and we all have to learn to live together, now, don't we? roar 'Hello.' - What was that? - 'Help.' It sounded close. Let's have a look. He's frozen with cold. Let's get him warm, quickly. 'He's coming around.' Hello, where am I? Don't be afraid, little one, you're with friends. I'm Claus, and this is Tingler, Shiegra and Blinky. I'm Weekum, and I guess I got lost and I saw your house, and I stepped into this big drift of snow and it was very cold and.. Well, you're alright now, Weekum. Tell us where you live. In a place for kids who don't have mothers and fathers or anyone else to take care of them. Well, little Weekum, let's be pals, you and me. Okay, Mr. Claus, friends. Friends. What's that you're carving? Oh, just a little cat, like Blinky here. miaow Blinky's a nice cat. I wish I had a cat like her. Well, there's an idea. You get some sleep, and maybe tomorrow morning I'll have a surprise for you. A surprise? That would be nice. Goodnight, everybody. What do you have in mind, Claus? A cat like Blinky. A copy, a little wooden one. Not bad for your first spielzeug, juguete, jouet miaow, grr, toy. That's the word, toy! A toy. I like the sound of the word. 'Yes, it's a good word, Tingler.' And I slept at his house, and when I woke up there was this big surprise, what he calls a toy. Mr. Claus, can you make another? One we could all share. Big surprise! Big surprise! And so, Claus had made his first toy. There were more to come. By the end of the week, he had made dozens. whoosh You beg immortality for a-a toymaker? zing Surely, there is more to tell. Much more indeed. The demand for his toys kept Claus busy. But he was quite happy in knowing the pleasure it gave to so many children. The Ryls, Knooks, and Wood Nymphs helped and supported him in his new endeavor. Now what do you call that one? Well, I thought you were the one with the names for things. Okay, okay. Right, you are. I name it a-a-a bambola, a puppchen, a poupee. How about a doll? Sounds perfect to me. I'd like to give this one to that little girl the one I met in the castle during my trip with the Great Ak. But she's a rich lord's daughter. Rich or poor, children are children. And I intend to treat them all the same. Then this toy-making is going to be a full-time business. What was that? "Mr. Claus. "If you make another toy, we're coming for you. Signed, King Awgwa." Who is King Awgwa? growl Ah, malvagio, mauvais dangereux, schlecht, malo. Bad, bad news! A little more information if you please in Burzee talk. Well, it's said that the Awgwas influence children. Make them do terrible, bad things like stealing, fighting and-and quarreling disobeying their parents, that kinda stuff. And where do we find these terrible Awgwas? Their homes are in the rocky mountains, not far from here. Hmm, that's not good. growl What are you going to do? Nothing, it's toy-making as usual. Oh, uh, one other thing I forgot to mention. Yes. It's said that they can make themselves invisible. Goodnight. Invisible? Well, that does make it a bit more difficult, eh, Shiegra? growl Yes, I agree. We'll have to be on our guard. So.. ...he's going to continue his blasted toy-making. Well.. ...we'll see about that. What? Ting.. Come to me, ye Knooks of the Forest! Who are you that call upon the Knooks? How do you know the call? I am a friend of your brothers in Burzee 'a friend of Peter Knook.' So, we cannot capture this toymaker easily for he has friends among the immortals. But we can keep him from making the children happy. Tomorrow, when he leaves for the village.. The Awgwas. We must find a way to defend ourselves against these invisible foes. I won't be defeated so easily the next time. The Awgwas have stolen the toys each and every time I've gone into the village. 'Counting yesterday, it makes 12 attacks.' We must plan some type of defense. Good! Ha ha ha. Good! They'll never find this cave and Claus will soon give up his toy-making and the children will be ours to control again. I'm going to try one more time. By night...and alone. growl Oh, Claus, that's ba-a-ad, a bad idea. I must try one more time. I can't give up. Thought you could outsmart King Awgwa, did you? The toys! I will continue to make my toys. I'll find a way, you'll see. roar Keep making toys, Claus. Our caverns are not yet full. Appear, King Awgwa, and face me. Who dares call on us and has the power to force us into visibility? It is I, Master Woodsman of the world. We owe no allegiance to you, nor to any immortal. Yeah, that's right. That is true. Yet you have ventured to interfere with the actions of Claus who dwells in Laughing Valley and is under my protection. You rule only the Forest of Burzee. The valley is ours. We will do as we please with this Claus. You shall not harm my friend in any way. Our powers are as great as yours immortal fool! So, you refuse to obey me? It is war! War! No one is master of the Awgwas. So, you defy me? With revenge! Your friend, Claus shall be captured within three days and done away with for good. If it is war you want, then war you shall have. Farewell, King Awgwa. Forever. Great Silver Axe. chime chime I am sorry I have to call upon you but this war cannot be avoided although I have tried. Cut well, Great Axe against these hosts of evil. Behold! They fight with tree branches. I will overwhelm them with our evil powers. Go forth, Great Dragon and incinerate them. whoosh whoosh growl growl growl growl poing growl chime sizzle sizzle Your evil friends have been defeated. It is the law that good shall overcome evil. Forward, immortals! Charge! I hear you have many toys ready for the children. You may carry them safely across the valley without fear. The Awgwas have perished. It's...no use. We'll never get it to move. clip clop clip clop - Reindeer! - Yes, Claus. Uh, the reindeer will be able to pull your sleigh with ease. Uh, but, they've never been out of the forest before. So you'll have to guide them with these. How can I ever thank you, Peter Knook? Uh, by having these deer back in the forest before daybreak, hm? Daybreak it will be. Are you sure you can handle all this, Claus? We'll soon find out. All ready? Away we go! Why, we've crossed the entire valley in just a few leaps. It's almost like.. ...flying! Ho ho ho. Now I know why they call it Laughing Valley. Ho ho ho. Our first stop. In you go. knock knock I'm afraid, friends, that we've made our journey for nothing and will have to take all of the toys back. - What's the matter? - The doors are locked. And I can't get in. We've never tried this at night before. Well, you have to get in somehow. Please. Oh, sorry, the roof. Why don't you go down the chimney? 'Good thinking. Ho ho ho.' Why, the children have hung their stockings by the chimney to dry. A good place for a little morning surprise. Why not? Well, that worked rather well. If we find any more locked doors, we'll know what to do. Look, more toys! Where did they come from? The good Claus must have been here for his are the only toys in the world. But how did he get in? A saint like Claus has no need to unlock doors if it pleases him to enter our home. Saint Claus? Santa Claus. You were late, Claus. I-I'm sorry, Peter Knook. But it was only one minute after daybreak. A minute is a minute, you know. I would like to use the deer again. And I think they enjoyed the trip. Well, I don't know about that. One time, yes, but, uh.. It's for the children. Won't you reconsider? Pour les enfants, bambini, kinder, ninos. For the children. For the children. growl Well, since you put it that way.. Okay, for the children. Yay! But only once a year, on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve, but that's only ten days from now. You won't have time to make enough toys. You'll lose an entire year. - Maybe not. - But how? If I had the toys the Awgwas stole I could easily fill the sleigh, and more. But how can we find them? It's no use. We've only one more hour until Christmas Eve. We'll just have to postpone the trip until next year. One year? Just think of all the toys we'll have by next year. But just think of all the disappointed girls and boys this year. See you all in the morning. Goodnight. Don't give up hope. Not so happy tonight. Unless.. jingle jingle Claus, get up! The toys, they've found them! Get a move-on, Claus, or you'll never be back by daybreak. My first Christmas Eve. Ho ho ho. His generous deeds will live forever. Your story touches even my cold and windy heart. Where is the man, Santa Claus today? Santa Claus has been delivering the toys for 50 mortal years. And now, when he has won the love of all the world the Spirit of Death hovers over him. growl I am only a mortal, Shiegra and all mortal life fades but this tree with its decorations will remind you of how we delivered our toys to children all over the world. We'll decorate the tree like this every year, Claus and we will never forget you. And what is your desire, Great Ak? To bestow upon Claus the Mantle of Immortality. In all the world, there is but one mantle. It has existed from the beginning and no mortal has ever dared to claim it. What will it profit any of us 'if it is allowed to remain in its lonely shrine' 'for all time to come?' You are right, Great Ak. I vote yes. So say you all? Aye. Against? So be it. Thank you. Bring the golden crypt. We bestow this mantle upon Claus who is called the patron saint of children. Merry Christmas. Sleep, my immortal son, and awaken to a new life. Thank you, Great Ak. I will try to be worthy of the mantle. Of that I have no fear, Santa Claus. I have devoted myself to the children, Great Ak. For in all this world, there is nothing so beautiful.. ...as a happy child. roar
