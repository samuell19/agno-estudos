Fall, 1987 Fellow workers of Dongsung Metal Works! I'm Kim Jungmin, a worker in the cutting team Is this supposed to be foods for us, the basis of Korea's industrial power? Are we slaves? Or are we machines? We spend every single day with extra shifts, night shifts, and irregular shifts!

But those bastards calculate regardless of it and give us the most a trained worker can do in an hour Do you think they consider us as human beings?

Yes Back then it was very liberating He is not doing it in his own will His superiors order him to do it... But it's too much Do you know how much did I get my ass kicked when I was a newcomer here? I've got beaten up pretty when I was an apparentice You've been in this shithole quite a long time, too, eh? Well, maybe over a decade.. Did you make some money? What kind of money? So how about you? Did you make some? No way it just doesn't work out as I want Every time it was close things that cost fortune happened If I were by myself, I could do something... It's a damned world Let's sleep now We've got works to do tomorrow Yep LET'S ACCOMPLISH 0% DEFECTS AT ALL COST Jesus... Man! It just heats me up good Now this is some "rest"! Damn... Well ya, ain't ya gonna take a shot? You drink straight up from this early That's enough Man it's way too bitter! Soju is the best for steel dust (pun) We're not a gundam or something By the way this motherfucking boss always harasses us from this early! But that man has no match in diligence, ya know Look at that boy of his so-called executive director I ain't know what he got in the US He's far behind from his father in diligence! Jeez, brother Don't look at me like that, kid So when the boss arrives clap as hard as you can! Got it? Hey, grinding team Stand in a straight line! Back a bit, yeah just like that You can't even stand in a straight line? Boys! Boss's arriving! Got it! Clap the best out of you! And give me some smile, smile! Good morning, sir -Mh How is it going? -Come this way, sir The inside is all sorted out, sir Alright, alright This machine right here always has been a trouble Wait, isn't this my Dongup, is he? Hey Dongup, how's it going? This is an honor, sir! Hah! You butt has been around for quite a time, ain't you? Yeah, it's been like 15 years or so, sir You smell of alcohol! Stop drinking that much, you drunkard! Hey, does that drunkard work hard? I'll give you a report after finding it out Damn the report! Don't! For what do you keep an old buffer? If he's not good enough, just fire him Yes, sir Mr. Song Commence briefing Yes, sir If we look at here... Hey cut it! That's the part for the factory no.1, so move on What was it? Ah yes talk about the thing about union or something You've got any plan for it? Ah yes I'll brief you on that matter There's already a joint labor management council with the heads of the teams and managers as leaders We're now recruiting men from each team that can be used as strike breakers in the time of emergency Do it thoroughly This place always has been a pain in the ass -Mr. Song! -Yes, sir If you fuck this up this time you will face some consequences Understood, sir I've always said this but I can't ever allow a union! We've been in a middle of heyday and what the fuck is this? After we've got some shit called democratization by some puny students protesting And now oiled up blues rebel up For fuck's sake! Anyway in no way can I allow unions! If we get unions, I'll sell this place up and buy some stocks or lands You are great! How come you've got that yee-yee ass vigor being a young man? Fucking I can't even get hard after a night shift When I was at your age, nig Even though I did night shift everyday My boy was reckless! You are pathetic, boy For what use? Haha hah! you slick Wait for me! You motherfucker... Dude, you already know that it's good for all of us! Yeah but I don't feel attached to them as much as to you bro I've been in factories after graduating junior high all along It's hard to care about others, isn't it? What we need is a small unity... Then the chief can't beat or call you names Also we can get a raise Only if it were that easy as you say.. It's all because we couldn't go to college You fool, do you even watch TV? People protesting in the screen are people who couldn't go there just like us! The motherfucking boss says: I'm paying you with my money Why do you complain so much? Ungrateful bastards Let's do the same to him! If he doesn't pay us much we won't work as much! Who's gonna blame us for that? Ain't I right? Good morning, sir Yeah, come in, please sit So how's your mother doing? She's doing good I've gotta pay her a visit for the sake of your late father... Even though I know that you're working in this company I'm not in the position to get you some treats So I've found a good opportunity by chance these days I recommended you for it After all, you've been working hard What is it? Yeah? Nothing special. Dept. Chief's making a small society A mutual aid society or something like that The director donated 3 million won for it (8000$ today) So we had to choose one from each team to recommend Eh? I don't deserve it... No, no this looks like something irrelevant for now In reality it's a way to elect executive candidates Hey, sign your name here And with this get your mother some fine meal No, I can't take it! No no this isn't something big But please take it It's just a small expression of my gratitude, take it! Anyway we've got to do something Our company is known for treating workers like shit even in the 5th industrial complex You've got any idea? No.. it's bugging me We can't do something when we don't know a shit! Our factory doesn't even get some undercover students! (in 8-90's, many Korean students worked in factories under fake identity to make unions) So Sukgu, in fact I've been thinking this till now Let us make a labor union! A labor union? Well, seems like someone was already acting before me I was thinking of becoming a chairman by talking off people Let's get some people! We gather up and study altogether Whatchu doing? Well I was thinking who would participate in it Hansu won't do this... Why do you hate Hansu so much? I don't hate him But he's a dick! It's not like he's the only poor man here He acts like a drama king being a young poke! Don't be so harsh on him How about that lady Sukhui from the packaging team? She goes to a night school, too Well... Get it off I know that you like her What's up with everybody, jeez Why are you guys trying to set me up with her? Brother Dongup and all For real I haven't even talked to her Then now's your chance For god's sake... Just eat ramyeon It's mine! It's out! Out! That's 1 for us! It's out! It's a tie with 8:8, got it? Hold on! It's payday, right? Let's take a bet for some booze! That's mighty fine! Wait, we've got an extra shift today! Fucking hell it's always like this Let us just skip that shit! What company makes you work extra even on payday? Alright! Losers gonna take the risk, how 'bout that? Hey Wanik What do you think? It's good! Yeah, let's get it on tonight! Hm what about you, Hansu? Hansu also gotta come with us! Yeah let's skip the shift! Alright! Play ball! Are we really going to do it? Is it gonna be okay doe? Don't worry, butt We're doing it What the hell are you trynna do? Yu Wongi It's time to wrap it up, isn't it? Today's payday, I gotta go home with my money! What are you talking about? We've got an extra shift to do! Hey, what are you doing! Where do you think you're going? What in the world are you doing now! Today's payday! You've always done an extra shift on payday! It's not a special occasion! You all know that! It's a time for some party After all it's payday! What? What's all of this nonsense! Don't ignore me, you maggots! Hey, where the hell are you going! Don't you see we're wrapping it up and going to change outfits? Wha.. hey! What is this now? Change to your coveralls at once! We never told you we're doing that shift We've never signed up for that What kind of jive are you talking? Which company makes workers do extra shifts even on payday, huh? Only ours does that shit in this complex! Fucking bullshit! Even that lil' shit dares to... Calm down, pal It's only once in a while so go easy on them It is you who's so easy on them that corrupts them like this! Shut it and get us the paycheck! Jesus fucking Christ Why you little...! What's wrong with you? You maggots don't want to work here? Alright, let's get it done tonight! We don't wanna talk to you So just get us our paycheck! What the fuck? Am I your servant or something? "What the fuck"? You lil' motherfucker! Fellas, let's go down and finish the work first And then we talk this over I'll buy you all a drink We ain't gonna work again after changing like this and all Yeah we're all clean'd up It's payday so We've made a promise to have a party altogether for once We can't break that up now Hey, let's finish the job first We've got loads stacked up I'll make sure this to be handled in the next labor management meeting Yeah, let's talk about this after the job is done Um.. Gentlemen, you are free to go home for today I'm going to get you your paychecks, too However, if this kind of thing happens again henceforth, I'll handle it by the company's rules I can't believe that just happened to us! Man! Have you seen that frowned face of the supervisor? Hah! Anyway let this be a tradition. No extra shift on paydays Y'all think it would be a tradition by just us saying so? We can do that! Stay together in line just like today that's it! I'd love to see that happen But even though we've done more than 200 hours of extra shifts We get paid only a little more than 200,000\(2,000$ today) And if we skip the extra shifts... But in reality the extra payments are of no use! If you've got more work you've got to hire more people Then they've gotta pay the real deal of whole paychecks So they make us do extra and night shifts to save that money You lil' bastard do know something! For what use? If you skip the extra shifts, what then? Are you gonna just sit there and starve? If they don't give us a raise we've got to make them do When did a boss give us a raise by his own will? In order to do that we need a labor union We can't even dream of it in this shithole Even Samjin made a union! Why can't we do what all others can do? Hey pal, I know union is good for us But it doesn't work out as we intend to It only ends up hurting the leaders of it Fuck, we're done for that! If we're gonna do that I'll do it until my head gets crushed! If someone's gonna get hurt we can be hurt altogether! If we're fucked up all The company is also screwed What are you scare of? Everyone let us drink to that! Hey love, drink up to the bottom Anyway what's up with forging team these days? Making a hustle trynna skip the extra shifts Chief Kim! You used to be better in the old days! What, do you want to quit or something? Fine! Even if I get to pay it with my pocket let's do some background check of these... Jesus love, what's up with you? I'll get it done, sir Director Song, will you keep doing that to my love? Yeah yeah I can't win you Sweet Miss Park Hey let's have some fun tonight Let us toast! Of course of course, to health! Brother, help us please! Like I said earlier I do know union is good for us But I won't take the lead Think about it! I'm 3 fingers short now Who's gonna hire me if I get fired here? Brother, that's why we need you more! I wish your success But I wouldn't be much of a help Good luck. Don't fail like the pals in last year I'm sorry I've got to go now then Brother! Dude quit that and take the shot now already You can't even hit it Fucking scrooge, play with one who matches your level! You aren't a 100-er You're a fucking national player It has been only 2 months since I got to this level Boy, it's called le "skill" Fine, let's bet on this one I'm tired, just get us off to home You're a youngster, man There's a spectacular one among the girls at Madonna She's probably there today, too Let's go there together Fucking clueless womanizer... I think Chunsup's off the list No! We can't just give up on him after only one talk! We need him at all cost And let's continue bonding with the cutting team with stuffs like sports match and whatnut Yeah, and about Wanik Don't you think he's got some potential? Yeah let's talk to him tomorrow -Well then, good night -'Night You're coming now you're tired, aren't you? It's freezing out here Why are you here? It's nothing, bro! So, your study's going well? Yeah, but brother Should I just quit the school and earn some bread? You idiot If you don't finish the school they don't treat you as a human being! Whatever happens, you you must wear a white collar do you understand? Hey, take a puff No, I'm fine, thank you It's alright, take one By the way, who started to talk about the union? It's already a depression now and these factory boys going wild made executives pale They say if it keeps up like this we're about to shut down Is it that bad? On top of that, the real shitshow is when students sneak in Even though they're fucking red inside no one knows from the outside They're very tricky You too saw that shit last year didn't you? Because of the fuckers making a hustle in the cafeteria you only received half the pay Yes So in fact I recommended you as a supervisor candidate at the 3rd factory built in Banwol Well I... My experience is short and my ability... You're a bit short as you're from a job academy So that's why I talked to the director in person I garanttee this boy Look at his accomplishments Then he said that's not the problem The thing is that a supervisor has to have leadership Le-dar-ship? We female workers only get paid 140,000\(1500$ today) a month after working all day Also the boss calls women, in particular in her 3-40's as has-beens and exploits them with low wages Even the girls in Sechang right in front of our factory get paid 6,000\ a day! And us ladies ourselves are problematic as we accept such a horrible condition without resistance considering this job as some extra income I think this kind of problems must be sorted out Ah wait, I'm not over yet This kind of problems cannot be solved with proposals but only with labor unions Um it's my turn but my mind is suddenly.. Ah, the meal is a total mess Side is always the same pickled radish and they say the meal costs 900\ Hey, just read the script ahaha Ay, don't laugh at me! Anyway the meal is pretty bad Also, the press mold is problematic Originally you have to put in your finger about only 3cm With this shit you have to put in 10cm How could we do this? For thousands times a day, even! It's because the designers of that machine didn't even consider the plight of us, workers Ah stop laughing! I'm smart, too! Anyway, to continue they care more about machines than people getting hurt When Chunsup got his finger cut they just cast doctor's fee away to him as if he were some kind of a dog They harassed him up like he was not focusing on the work or some shit And when 2 days ago a machine part was broken How did they kick up a ruckus! For god's sake they think of us workers as some kind of pushovers! Brother, come out! Jaeman's here Jaeman? For what business in this late night? I was just stopping by on my way home Come out here for a moment Why don't you come in? It's cold out here In fact... We have decided to go to the sports park tomorrow Won't you join us? What for? Well there will be many people and... it'll be fun out there Is it something like a rally? Eh? Ah no it's not a rally it's rather... uh I've got an appointment with Mija That's good! You two can come together And it saves money, too I've been watching things around Jaeman, you're just going to get yourself hurt with that What do people like us have to be hurt more than now? If we're doing it we're doing it till the end Hey you seem to think of yourself as some kind of a hero Pull yourself together! We cannot be heroes! We're just lowlings Hey, it's not like that! Enough! If you wanna go, you go alone! Despite of raging, wild winds Comrade by Whitlow grass(꽃다지) Despite of crushing, harsh oppression We've come altogether firmly facing each other In a night of biting cold In a night of suffering We've confronted them Under an icy frost of dawn Love, love, an eternal love You won't change, comrade! Man, when that guy in his 40's was talking it was just like my story I was really touched You were about to leave being angry back then! When was I? It was just me being ignorant! Wasn't that girl great? I felt like a load's been taken off my chest What am I short of than Jaeman? Am I small? Am I stupid? But I get paid 8$ less per a day Hey, you're short of "something"! Jeez you simp! Anyway they want to cut our wages no matter what excuses they use Yeah, like that man said before Making a union can't simply mean making some more pennies or not doing some extra shifts Eh, then what is it for? It's for building a world where we workers are masters For that we should know how the politics of this country are like. Are you gonna be mad like that? It's once a year Dude like me shouldn't even make my love happy on her birthday? Even though we don't wear or eat such a luxury, we're happy now We're not some celebrities, are we? We deserve that too! And soon I'll be a supervisor A supervisor! For real? Are you kidding me now? You're short on experience I'm serious! What do you think of me, Hansu? Since I work so well They gave it to me by their will Hansu, so it's for real! It seems like the chief took a special care of me as we're from the same town He told me that I take a good look of the team considering myself as a supervisor already Your chief wants you to look for what? Isn't it ratting on the team? No! It's called leadership That's the duty of a supervisor, no? It's the same, for god's sake! It's their dirty tricks! My company does that spying stuff to break unions, too! Hansu, don't do such thing That ain't spying nor ratting on! You tell me to stop I'm already 25 It could be my only call! It's fine. I'm fine even if you are not a supervisor We know about all of that since we've got a union, you fool! I learned it! Learn what? So that's what you were studying... Hansu, please don't do that You can be a supervisor anytime later Will you promise me on it? You slick... Nowadays the labor movement is sweeping this country like a fever When I was in college I used to ponder a lot about the problems of employees so much that I even went to the memorial of Jeon Tae Il But people! If you're thinking as if the labor movement would solve all of your problems I'd like to tell you that you're stuck in 19th century Look at the case of the US where workers had built unions through the famous Mayday struggle Are there unions now in the US? They refused unions by themselves What a wise decision of American people just as they are What solves the problem is not violent and surd fight but time and efforts Everyone, we're already witnessing such examples in developed countries like the US Keeping trying to build unions despite of that is of no doubts, a voice of communists and their means is only the violence Everyone, please hang on for 1 year let's endure this together Educated men is indeed clever isn't they? They talk of politics every time saying union is for the welfare of workers It's their excuses That's the proof that they is suspicious Hey bro! Think about it y'all before it's too late I've been loathing commies ever since I was a jarhead Bro, don't just think like that all the way! We've been taught since childhood that someone says something suspicious is all commies And all commies are like wolves And that's what everyone including TV and newspaper say We're simple factory boys working our asses off day and night What do you even "think"? You've been saying we were right And suddenly someone says that's commie And you're saying now that our thoughts and deeds are all wrong all of sudden Fine, fine! Go the executive's office and win over him Then you'll be my guru Jeez Fuck it Hey, if you're not sure just quit it! Tomorrow we've got an extraordinary shift Look who's talking! You lot quit it! Us? We're gonna be there even if the world ends tomorrow Looks like you're scared already why don't you withdraw? We're not some pussies! Tomorrow we'll be there for sake of our honor So git gud! I'm a bit worried about this That supervisor will make a fuss out of this again, fuck Let's make it sure You all gonna be there tomorrow, right? I swore to the cutting team boys that if we're not there we're gonna serve them as masters Won't this thing put our meeting here in danger for nothing? No. We've gotta fight what we must fight We've made that appointment a week ago They just told us today to do extraordinary shifts saying shipping amount is on short or whatever The match is one thing but We've gotta make sure about this sort of things They didn't even tell us a word before notifying us Let's show that no viper so little but has its venom! I'm sorry but I'll have to go to the work I'd love to join you guys but If they lose trust on me at this age... These fuckers look down on me? Motherfuckers! Is it the forging team again? Yes, this time along with the cutting team, too Check that once again And push that project faster There should be no problems with shipping dates Yes, and I'll consult with Mr. Lee on this Who's Mr. Lee? The intel. division chief of the police has introduced him to me He's a veteran in taking care of leftist unions He's called James Lee (This guy exists) Attention! Let's have a singer from the forging team! Park Sukgu! Park Sukgu! Park Sukgu! Park Sukgu! Park Sukgu! Brother Dongup is originally the best singer in our team But since he's absent I'll take the turn instead I learned this song from Wanik sitting there Then, ehm Oh my dear hometown, my parents Worker's way by Ahn Chi Hwan How much time has passed since I left I, who has lived through all those times Isn't that brother Dongup? Yes he is! Brother Dongup! Brother, come and sit What happened? Did you work today? The job couldn't even begin! We were slacking till noon and they said to go home so I'm here What about Hansu? Didn't you come together? Well, the chief called him and seemed to go out together What about the administrators? I dunno they were here and there Chief says the director was furious saying he's gonna fire all of us Then, I know it's not possible but what we do if we receive disadvantages like fire or punishments? So I want to propose you that we make a labor union using this as an opportunity Let us talk about this matter! So, you haven't been able to even notice about that? Huh You've got my reputation ruined enough now It's unfortunate for you but you've got to take some time to be a supervisor Please wait, sir What, you've got anything to say? Let me think for a bit You think what? Hurry and speak it I'm a busy man! Mh Well I've been having eyes on my team members Have you? So? Come here you bastard! Joo Wanik, undercover student A defiant, rebellious element? So Wanik was... [a commie?] You're men! Don't let yourselves sag on a triple! Shut your mouth, gal! What's wrong? I can't believe that kid was actually a student... Why are you acting funny? It's not a funeral or something Wongi! This doesn't matter anymore at this point! Labor union or some shit We've been deceived by a commie kid What are you talking about? Don't you know, pal? Do you still not know Joo Wanik was an undercover student? Yeah! He's a student! So what? What's wrong with working in a factory after graduating college? Are you saying that it's commie wanting to live as a human being? If he graduated that college he could live affluently having a good job Don't you get why he came here instead! He's right. You don't have to judge him just because he's a student As Wanik said We are the masters of this world, aren't we? That fucking "masters"! So we, factory boys, are fucking masters of the world? Jesus fucking Christ! Hansu! You waited for along time right? I'm sorry What made you this late? Well I couldn't sneak out cuz there was an important meeting You must be starving Let's go and grab some dinner A meeting? Yes, it looks like that we're about to go on a strike A strike? Moreover, they think of us female workers as their toys! They talk in a rude way and touch our bottoms Anyway it's us to blame since we didn't fight back... Motherfuckers! And do they know about the strike? They'd know for sure But what could they do? The boss himself signed on the agreement and he's trying to break union before the ink isn't even dry! Well, he won't succeed! Even if everyone goes wild you stay behind If you get fired for this you can't get a job anywhere Today they've had one fired Why? He was an undercover student So? So what? They probably have rounded him up What business do puny students have with factory? Even using a fake name It's not they wanted to use one It's because they don't let them in No one asked them to! Freak'n lunatics Why would college kids come to factory unless they're commies I'm sure he was caught because someone ratted on him Bastards! Well I ain't know a shit! If I hear from this one this seems right If I hear from that one that seems also right What's up with you, pal? Well I don't know well since I didn't get education too But there's nothing wrong with the words of Wanik and Wongi, isn't it? What's rebellious with the idea we also have rights to live with dignity? The sky is full of stars Are you trynna change the subject now haha Let's get inside, it's freezing Jaepil, let's do this right and tight! I swear! I swear! 1. We, Dongsung volunteers, hereby swear that we set an example by doing our best in establishment of a healthy labor-management relations! 2. We, Donsung Volunteers, hereby swear that we will work having in mind that the employee lives only if the company lives 3. We, Donsung volunteers, hereby swear that we will work in any occasions with the virtue of communication compromise, and concession 4. We, Dongsung volunteers, hereby swear that we will take a part in protecting liberal democracy with the virtue of concession Fucking bullshit! "Dongsung Volunteers"? Is it a group of vomits or what? Hansu that shit probably has ratted on Wanik Laughable! Studying 5 years in the US seems to make your mind like that shit Fools, "American democracy company" my ass The fight has already begun! Do you want one? Hey, butt, what's wrong with you? Fuck off! Be rich alone in the strike breakers! You're on your own now What's wrong with y'all? That's not a way to treat a team member! Come in, quick! You've come all the way to this place! Come in! Jaepil! -Get him inside -Yes What ya doing? Come in! Is it Jaepil? I didn't know you were a shy person, bro! -It's not like you! -Man! hahaha -I'm so freak'n sorry -Get in, bro Here comes Jaepil! It should be somewhere around here... Execuse me, where's the union office? Union? It's up on 2nd floor -It's on the second floor -Yeah I went to the bookstore nervous as hell Forehead: Unite and Fight I couldn't dare to say to the shopkeep that there is a book about unions When we saw that there should be at least 30 signatures of initiates to establish a labor union on that book we bought We cried cuddling each other Why so? It was such a hard job to even gather 5 people here We hid in one house to another When we passed through gate carrying pamphlets in our chests for the announcement of establishing union you wouldn't know how nervous we were And then when managers tried to take them away ironically we became powerful getting desperate Let us too get this done Even these gals... No no Even our women here do this We ain't got balls if we don't do it Hey, c'mon! What! Y'all didn't mind that, did y'all? Then I declare it's settled 10am, Sunday, at the terminal That day is our first step in making our democratic union So I expect you to be on time without being absent It would be hard if we get a leak So stay shut, okay? Yes, it's an important matter Be especially careful on the security From now, we will check who could be there together ...honor and name and all March for the beloved A scorching vow For we shall advance together whole life Comrades are all perished Only the banner flatters Until the new day comes Shall we not waver Hansu! Even though the time flows Come this way! The nature knows Do you even eat properly? Yeah, we raised a fund Don't worry about me We advance first Isn't it marvelous? You will never know this feeling unless you do this yourself Do you know that song? Isn't it great? We advance first Who are those people? People from Dongwon Chemical came in solidarity Last night we defeated strike breakers in a ferocious fight altogether with Dongwon folks Managers came here being drunk! What?! Didn't you get hurt? I'm alright I bit them off, too Cosmos Co.also will go on a strike tomorrow My boss shut down this place on paper and handed over our loads there Are you not scared? Here! We've done it!! We live a humble life like Worker's Way by Ahn Chi Hwan a duckweed floating here and there on a lake But we are proud workers who build all the creations in this world But do not sag Now we shall have an election for the chairman after reading the manifesto Please, recommend the candidates Move, move! What's up with them today? Is there an accident happening? Sukgu! Did you hear that? What are you talking about? Looks like we've got a leak Chief asked me about it just before They were making a fuss saying they're making their union What? Is that true? Yeah Sukgu, where's the paper? In my place Let's go and submit it today, quick! Executive sir, it's the phone no. 3 Yes, sir Who's the chairman? Good work, sir Thank you, I'll pay you a visit Is it the ministry of labor branch? Yes, they say they've declined the paper that the forging team submitted These motherfuckers... There's no need for rage Turn the volunteers into the union Who the hell is the guy named Yu Wongi? He's on the blacklist, from Masan, sir Despite he graduated only the high school he was fired for making union from Changwon factory of Samjung Co. Fire the key members -It won't interfere the production, will it? -It won't, sir Fellow workers of Dongsung Metal Works I'm Yu Wongi from the forging team Few days ago, we've established a democratic union in Dongsung! But the ministry of labor does not recognize us and issue certificate It's due to the deceptive sabotage of the company Everyone! Thus we're here to announce the establishment of a democratic union and the election of the chairman and the executives by your hands -Everyone! -What the hell are you doing? Pull yourselves together! Ah, the civilization is failing Union? what kind of gibberish is that? Fuckers who try to live in comfort without working always argue union! union! Why are they even poor? Tighten your belt and save more How are you gonna save money when you drink and smoke? Anyway if you cannot stop this union shitshow, it will be all-or-nothing! Tomorrow you come to work with your resignation letters Hey, Mr. Song! Say if you've got something to say No, sir, for later, sir Yeah? Then I should go now You youngsters aren't comfortable with an old punk around! I know it! You're thinking when that olddie gonna get out, aren't you? No, sir, nevermind No no sit down and drink as much as you want sing some songs I expect you have listened to him carefully Starting from tomorrow the volunteers will be guarding the front gate, so make sure! Especially you supervisors must do the job right We've decided to recognize the guard duty as extra shifts Anyway I'll take full responsibility of you supervisors So let's do it alright! Notification of Temporal Closure Hey, get in the line Continue Normal Operation! Withdraw False Closure Continue Normal Operation! You're a walking alcohol! What happened? Let's go -Why? To where? All of sudden? Let's go! I said What's all of this? Do you think this will change something? Mija You hate strike breakers, don't you? Don't you wanna kill them? I'm... one of them! A fucking strike breaker in front of my friends Jaeman, Chunsup, Wongi with a baton in my hand! Why did I end up like this? I just did what I told to! I only tried to live well and diligent! Is it true? Hansu Wh, Why did you do that? Please stop it It's not too late Tomorrow say to them that you can never do this It's too late Why? I just can't anymore No one treats me as a human being I gotta leave as soon as there's a seat in the 3rd factory Stop this nonsense at once! Do you think they're really going to send you there? And if they do do you believe this kind of thing won't happen there? If you don't stop now you'll forever be their dog Do you know why we are poor? It's not that our parents were incompetent It's not that we couldn't learn enough It's because we're exploited In this fight, I realized what really matters is not money I canceled the installment savings You did what? I donated it all for the strike funds All of it? Yeah all of it Are you crazy? You know how much you worked for it And I'm doing this shit because of that damn money! So I'm telling you stop doing that shit! I won't You are really crazy For real you won't? Nope, I'll make money! Money! Do you think we really can make that much? I'm going back in The assembly starts soon I love you but if you don't stop that doggie-ass shit I will never see you again Crush it with Tenacity! Deceptive Busting Sabotage! Crush it with Tenacity! Crush it! Crush it! Fellow workers of Dongsung Metal Works! We've worked for them 12 hours a day And they pay us with discharges! Is it a crime building a labor union? Creating a labor union is a righteous right of us, workers, which is also written in the law! Why does the boss not recognize our union? It is to conceal the exploitation of our labor It is to dismiss our righteous demand This is why he fired us who built a labor union! Fellow workers of Dongsung Metal Works! Let us unite altogether and crush their primitive stratagem! Disband Paper Union Defend Democratic Union! Disband Paper Union Defend Democratic Union! Defend it! Defend it! Deceptive Busting Sabotage! Crush it with Tenacity! Crush it! Crush it! Hey ladies Leave us for a moment, will you? Why~ It's just for a moment Mr. Song, speak As the police intel. dept. chief said before It would be better off to scatter them with additional 1 million won for their retirement pay (12,000$ today) Then more than half will be gone And let the cops handle the rest, eh No, we cannot leave such an example You've got to do a fundamental treatment Set a clear example now so that there never will be talks of unions Please elaborate on setting an example First, the strike breakers at this moment are not enough We need professionals And we need to separate the key figure, Yu Wongi from others Which means, to eliminate him Comrades, they're violating our lawful rights as of this moment! We're not machines! We're not slaves! -Please join us! -Let go of this thing! -Give us a hand! -I'm sorry Come on! Let's fight together! Let's see at that pub after the work And we shall crush their deceptive stratagem with our united struggle! -Comrades, until the day of the worker's liberation -Men, c'mon, push them off! Let go of me, let off! Y'all sons of bitches! Let go of me! Hey Hansu, will ya take a look on this? No thanks Recognize democratic union Kim Chilbok motherfucker What? Are you quitting it now? And gonna work?! You bastard I tried to treat you well as you're from the same town with me I know, I know, Hansu But there's no other way! The boss says on the day union takes place he'll shut down this factory What can we do about this? And if you were to return to the work quitting this Do you believe they would let you do that? All of this will be sorted out in few days And then you're gonna be a supervisor at the 3rd factory So, let's hang on for just few days, will ya? You'll stay here tonight, right? I've got a schedule today A schedule? With whom? I saw you talking with Yu Wongi this morning Is that it? Yes Fine. I'll keep it a secret only for this time Instead, you'll do your best after today, understood? Answer my question! Yes, sir Alright, now you may leave Call the executive director People never cared about me when I was starving I hate being poor I couldn't even graduate junior high because I couldn't afford the tuition When I look at people of my age who go to the college it drives me crazy I don't want to leave like brother Dongup I swear to me every time I go to work Hansu, you leave all of your prides here, at home Just endure till the end whatever the supervisor rants So you make a fortune like CEO Kim Chilbok Let's sign up for the extraordinary shift for this Sunday as usual Why living like that is a bad thing? Why do I have to be called names? Don't cry, friend Take a shot! Hansu, the reason that we're poor that you couldn't afford school is because we were deprived of what's originally ours I would act just like the supervisor if I were one And the managers wouldn't let me do things other way around What matters is not the money What matters is that we live as human beings For that to happen we must unite I used to be a strike breaker like you I was actually more of a fanatic Because I thought they were commies But the friend who led the strike cried in front of me saying I'm pitiful and he pities me so much that he sheds tears for me Why does everyone say the exact same thing? Why is that so! Drive! Hello, brother Yeah, how've you been? It's been a long time I'm so sorry for I can't be much of a help So, how's Wongi? He's in surgery What brings you here? To my place I want to have a word with ya Why? "Why"? Ya fucking son of bitch! Get up, ya maggot! Dregs like ya must die off ya piece of shit! Wasn't ratting on Wanik enough? So you tried to kill Wongi, too? What's with Wongi? What? Head to the fucking hospital ya rat! And see what's with Wongi! Hey, Hansu, come! Sit by the fire! It's damn boring When does this thing over? What are we even doing out here, away from home? Where are the chief and the supervisors? Obviously they'd be wasting themselves at the restaurant "Chungbuk" Motherfuckers, damn! Fuck! In this freezing weather we are fucking our asses here and they... This is fucking mean I just wanna... Piss off! Let go of me! Go and lick that boss's ass! You pathetic fool! We'll fight till the end! Why don't you realize? Even if you may get paid few pennies more for now You're really pathetic! You make me cry, dumbfuck! I'm an idiot I don't want to face them again tomorrow at the gate no matter how good is getting a raise and promoted to a supervisor What? They said they gonna make you a supervisor, too? What the fuck? They also promised me the same! Mr. Lee at 3rd factory said they didn't even pay for extras not to mention being a supervisor Then freezing out here now doesn't even count as extra works? -Correct -Then what are we? For what have we... Don't turn on the light What was that? Careful! What? A black list? What the... Take a look at this! What's that? Bastards! Fucking cocksuckers! Good morning, sir Hello, sir Have you secured the load? Yes, sir Disband Paper Union Defend Democratic Union! Disband Paper Union Defend Democratic Union! Defend it! Defend it! It has been 30 years of blossoms and snowflakes An old worker's song by Whitlow grass after I became a worker in this land where I was born What have I achieved? What do I want?
