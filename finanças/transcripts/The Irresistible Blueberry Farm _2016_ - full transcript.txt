Look, you wantto run this in for me, give it to Paula? I will not. Why? Neither will you. You can return ityourself. Look, I'm just... Trying to be respectful here. He's a decent enough guy. Doesn't meanhe's the right guy. -Hi!-hey. Wow. I didn't evenrealize I left it. Thank you. Sure. How's Hayden? Out for the count. Does he need a doctor? No, he just needs to sleep. So you got a minute? Sure. Why? I've got somethingI'd like to show you. I thought you'd like to seewhat you're helping me with, what I'm fighting for here. Stop. Stop! What? What?What's the matter? This was all blueberries,wasn't it? What, you knowthis place? My grandmother, she--she painted this. She, um, she painted a lot. I saw one of her paintings, and I guessthere's supposed to be more. I took a picture of the murali found in her attic. Wow. Never looked this goodwhen I was a kid. And this is whatyou're fighting for. Yeah.It has to be them. Look at them. They must have beenso young. It doesn't matter.They knew. This is what I would make itlook like again. Gosh... We spent so much timeon this porch. Are we trespassing? Now you're worriedabout trespassing? As long as you havemoney for bail. This is the living room. I'll show you around.Look at this. Whoa! And then you have this,the kitchen and dining room. So we just-- we just livedin between these two rooms, and then out hereon this porch. My uncle loved it here. He was... He was so good with the ground, you know,with growing things. You know, it was actually him who figured out which blueberrygrows best here, 'cause the startsare really expensive, and you don't get a blueberryfor a couple years, so if you don't get it right,it sets you back. Like life. A few false starts? No more than anyone else,i guess. You? No. At least, I didn't think so. Who are these owners? A guy from bostonbought it off the family when Chet left town. Then he died,and his kids inherited, and they're the ones that want to carve it upinto a subdivision. Yikes. What happened? Nothing. It's just...Safe in my room. You got an injunction, right? That's what stopped the work? That was smart, but we need a longer play. Well, I might've foundthe rare butterfly that breedsdown by the creek. It's down here. Roy, all we have to dois cause enough trouble. The heirs decideit's not worth it, and then they'll takea fair offer. We can do that, right? We? Yeah. I'll be in the officeon Monday, and I'll get started. You know,my gran would want that, so I'll make suresomeone in the capitol is greasing the wheels and keeping everythingmoving. Thank you. Roy... look at this! My gosh,i can't believe this. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!You okay? Yeah. Look at this! This placejust won't give up? Neither will I. Here. Go ahead. Wow. Right? Really good. So you, grew up here? I wish, but it is wherei spent all my summers. Every timei come back here, it's... like a reunion. No, that's not the right word. It's like coming home again, only I never lived here,so... It's coming homefor the first time. You rushed back! How did you do that? What are you talking about? Coming home againfor the first time? Those exact words. What a bright young man. Gran, I am practically engaged. Practically,in every sense of the word. Yippee. Tell herthat we'll be in touch, all right? Hello? You're alive! Hey! What are you up to? Well, I'm actuallytrying to track down the elusive sugar falkand Ruth's paintings, but I think maybe I havethe wrong phone number, or she's ducking our calls, but I havea paralegal on it, so promise you, I'm going to get youthose paintings. Thank you so much. That's nice! But don't thank me until I get them inour hot little... What? Yeah, I've gotto take this. -Mccutcheon?-mccutcheon, yeah. -You guys have got no reception.-He's calling now? He's calling!You've got no reception here. I'm not goingto talk to the guy. -I know, I know...-Hello, hello? Hey, I...I don't know. Um... hello? This is going to takea little while, like, an hour, I don't know,maybe two hours. Hello? Hello?No, don't-- don't hang up! So, I don't know, go play, or go do something fun,and I'll catch up with you? Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Hey, thanks for the paintings.You're the best. I know. Thank you.Hello? Hello? Yeah, yeah, yeah,no, no, no. Yeah... Yeah, hello.This is me.! Nota west-facing room, please. I don't need the sunbaking me in the afternoon. Now, can I make a spa appointment with you? Mom? Well, there she is.You are alive. What are you doing here? Hunting you down. Is this a new hairstyle? Um... I just didn't havea chance to do it yet. I...you didn't have to come here. Honey, I called youseveral times. I even texted. It's been hectic. Here? Honey, you could shoota Cannon down main street and not even hit a caribou. Let's go for a walk,how about? So many nice thingsto see. Okay. You can have the valettake my bags up. Right after your spa treatment.Absolutely. Great, great, yeah. I don't understandthis game, Ellen. You make him wait, you make himwant you more, but then you say "yes." He's a croft. He has options. I don't remember askingyour opinion, mother. You know, this will bethe wedding of the year, Ellen, and not justnew York society, but all of Fairfield countyand Philadelphia. Don't you wantto get it right? Yes.... Well, good, because I talkedto the wedding planner, I gave her some examples... Mom! Well, you can go aheadand do what you want. I just knowthat a wedding of this scale can be dauntingfor someone like you. Like me how? Busy. Ellen, this iswhat I'm good at. Just let me help. I want your help, but Hayden and I don't careabout the trappings. Did he tell you that? Because trust me, he knowsthat this is a big deal. Let's get a bite.Here. A bite?In an ice cream store? Well, they havesandwiches. Just don't ordera soy latte. You'll be fine. Hi, ladies! Hi! Um, I'll havea Turkey panini, please, and iced tea. -I'll have that, too.-Absolutely. Ellen? Hey! I was just talking about you. Hi! Listen, I got two thingsI've got to tell you. The butterfly,it is endangered, so we throwthe kitchen sink at 'em. We'll hit 'emwith everything we've got. We'll order a fullenvironmental impact study, and learn all sorts of thingsabout butterfly migration. Listen, this was all your idea, and I actually thinkwe have a shot, so... Thank you. I'm Cynthia branford,ellen's mother. Hey, sorry. Roy cumberfield. Cumberfield? Yeah, he's Chet's nephew, and Roy is dealingwith some real estate issues that I'm helping him with. Anyway, I, i hate to interrupt. You guys enjoy your lunch. You said there were two things? It can wait. It was a pleasure meeting you. Likewise. Bye-bye. How much will that be? It's taken care of. Thank you. So you foundchet cumberfield? Yeah, he's... Well, passed away, and Roy was his heir. So, you deliveredthe letter? Then missionaccomplished! But Ellen,when did this happen? Why are you still here? Gran was a painter. What? No, she wasn't. I never saw her painta day in her life. Well, she quitwhen she left beacon. Well, then, it was a hobby,when she was a child. She was an artist. She got acceptedto the Chicago institute of art. She... She was brilliant. She knew about composition. She knewwhat she was talking about when she taught me photography. Ellen? Excuse me? Um, I didn't getto see this. I know,they sold out so fast. Ellen, honey... What happened? I guess I wasjust glad to be on dry land, you know,grateful to be alive. Honey,you are Ceci baker. Who? You remember ceciwith the teeth? My doubles partner? Four years ago,she was diagnosed with cancer. She found the best oncologist, and she's cured... And she fellin love with him. He was the reasonthat she survived. He was the mostmagnificent creature that god ever created... Okay, I get it.I get it. What happened? She got over it, because she realized the entire infatuationwas just relief at being alive. What does he do? Roy? He builds houses. And can you honestly seeyourself giving up everything that you've workedyour entire life for for that? What about Hayden? Do you love him? I do. Then we are going to planthe wedding of your dreams. This is Ellen. Hey, Ellen. It's Roy. About that other thing... Can you meet meat the beach house? Roy? Whoa! What's the occasion? You were right. Apparently, the Boston kids were running onall kind of borrowed money... ...and the thought of beingin court for the next few years has made them want to sell. So it's yours!The blueberry farm is yours! Thanks to you. I've been dreaming about thisfor so long. You're all set! Almost. Roy, is... Is that this dock? I think so. How did you...? As it turns out,sugar falk is a hoarder, who believesin the barter system, and she has a basement that needs somefoundation work. She has two otherones you'll get when I finish the job. Hey, I paymy legal fees. You didn't haveto do this. What, you're not goingto negotiate? Come on. We'll make it fun. This is the nicest thingyou could ever have done for me. I have to go.
