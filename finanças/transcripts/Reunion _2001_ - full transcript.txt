â™« Multicom Entertainment Group Opening Music (ominous music) (chattering) (cool music and chattering) (triumphant music) (motorcycle revving) (sighs) - Good evening fellow graduates of the class of 1981. It's been a long time, 20 years. That's a long time. (chuckles) Oh great Margaret insult them right off the bat. I recognize a lot of you in this room here tonight. Hell I've slept with most of you. (laughs) I am sure all of you have been through some changes. As many of you know, I am now the mayor of Ojai. Thank you, thank you very much. (mutters) I remember that precious summer after graduation, that last summer before we were expected to move on with our lives. It was freedom. I remember my mother telling me, Margherita you don't have to win a Pulitzer Prize (speaks spanish) big brass ring ha! It was the Brady Bunch. - I'm so sorry to bother you but your assistant Luisa has called so many times. - What does reunion mean to you? - Well um you loved somebody once and then you see them again and all those feelings come back up from inside. - Great. Great. (radio chatter) (hip hop music) - Shit! Shit! (door slams) Shit! Shit! I came this far. (marching band blares and whistles) - Coffee? - Yes I'll have a coffee. How about a cheese sandwich um with avocado and lettuce and tomato and salt and pepper and a little mayo please. You know what make that um breakfast. I'll just have a little breakfast and scrambled egg whites and hash browns, crispy. - Coffee? - Couldn't live without it. Thank you. Class of '81? - Mm yes actually. - Are you here for the reunion? - Yeah. I don't remember where my yearbook is. - My mother found it for me in my old bedroom in my closet where I grew up. - Uh huh. - Brad Wellington. You are? - I'm Jeanie. My name's Jeanie. - My sister had a goldfish called Jeanie. - That's an awfully odd name for a goldfish. - Matter of opinion. - Hmm. - Oh you wanna look at it. - No, I'm not nostalgic. - But you came to your 20th reunion. - I'm not nostalgic either. - But you have a yearbook. Could I have a turkey club dry? - So I don't know you. - No smoking please. - I don't smoke. Maybe I, maybe I know you from P.E. - Maybe. - You know our graduating class wasn't that big. Whose homeroom were you in? - Come on you remember who your homeroom teacher was 20 years ago? - Well how can you forget a drunk homeroom teacher? I mean she'd come in with toilet paper draggin' off her foot and then there's the time she had her skirt stuck in the back of her tights, the day of the week printed on the back of her underwear. Tuesday on her ass. (laughs) - I remember that. - You remember that and you don't remember me? - I guess so. - And I don't remember you. I think I should have remembered you. (keys jingling) (Hispanic music blaring) (speaks Spanish) - Good evening my fellow graduates of the class of 1981. We're gonna reminisce, talk about trends and fads and cool fashions. We're gonna talk about halter tops and bell bottoms. Okay, what I remember the most was that precious summer after graduation. Shit, Luisa! (elevator music plays) - I recommend Antigua. Blue water, good nappers. No, can you give me a minute to return these calls okay? And then I'll (mumbles). Mindy? (papers shuffling) - It's not your fault Erv. Okay? You hear? - Yep. - Here? - Yep. You know why, excuse me. Why don't you let me follow through on this one? - It's my job. I'll get it over to them today okay? - I think you should take the day off. - Fine. - I think you should go home. (cries) Mind, you deserve better than him. (uplifting music) - Hey, how'd you like a real authentic Lieutenant Colonel's jacket? - Whose? - Mine. - You're not really a colonel. You're way too young. You aren't even a grandfather yet. - You're right. Hey, I gotta go, my pop's waiting for me. You want it or not? (twangy uplifting music) (rock music and phone ringing) - Boccali's? Hey Mr. Roberts how you doin'? I love the heat sir, I'm a pizza maker. Yeah, you come see me in 20 minutes and I'll have your special pie waiting for you. Yeah, you too Mr. Roberts. - Hang on. We're gonna be late. - I know I know Luisa. I know. - Bobby! Bobby get your ass off that motorcycle. Hey Yvette, tell your sister I'd like to see her again sometime. Hey nice manners! Bobby get your ass inside. You got a mess to clean up and some pies to deliver. I don't pay you minimum wage to flirt with cheerleaders. - But you gotta get good tires 'cause your car won't go without and your future's ridin' on it. There aint no doubt about it. (tires screeching) Thanks for coming! - No problem and congratulations on your opening. And as soon as all my tires are bald, I will be in for a new set. - Come down in anytime for a free inspection before they go bald mayor or a rotation. - Oh I will keep that in mind Stan. - Margaret, we need to resolve the speed bump issue and the set master Zodie Park. Oh very flat, very useless. - Uh sweetheart, schedule a speed bump meeting with Mr. Andretti, yes thank you darling. - Margaret, you are just the mayor that I needed to see today. - What brings you to Ojai, tires? - No, space. Margaret, this is Free Sky. She's the yoga instructor from the one mind institute in Ventura. - Yes I took one of your classes. - She wants to open up an institute right here in Ojai. - Excellent, Luisa Luisa can you put Miss Frisky. - That's Free Sky. - Free Sky of course. - Oh thank you. Free Sky. - Oh my god. - Margaret, when you're done City Councilman Beard would like a word with you. - Okay, Luisa step away from the door now. - Oh photographer. - No, photojournalist. - Capturing your every moment back in rustic Ojai. - Look like you did in high school just sittin' at the diner - What like this? - Bye high school Brad. - What? - You transformed. - Meaning? - There's the shoulder hunch for one thing. - Occupational hazard. - Oh yeah? What do you do? - They call me the terror of Polk Street. - Dare I ask why? - I'm a bus driver. - I live in San Francisco but I don't take public transportation. - Yeah I know those types. Hey listen, driving around a bit, taking in the scenery if you wanna tag along. I'll show up for your pictorial. - Sure, why not? - Alright. (soft music) (birds chirping) - How do you keep these plants alive in this heat? - Well your mother gave them the will to live, I just do the seasonal maintenance. How are you? Hi, son. Well I am damned. I knew you were coming but I forgot it was today. I can never remember where I put the damned calendar. - Well, couldn't miss my 20 year reunion. - Well 20 years slip by without my noticing? - Yes sir. - Well are you high-ranking military men allowed to have a cold beer on your day off? - Considering I'm permanently off, sure. - What did you say Pat? - I'm retired. Let's go have that beer. - Pat? (tv blaring) Christ Pat. - Pop, hear me out. - I'm gonna hear you out. But this better be good, you don't just abandon the United States Army. - I didn't abandon anything. I retired just like anybody else would in any other profession. - Pat, your 37 years old. - I got my whole life ahead of me. - Well what the hell are you gonna do? You gonna come back here and help me in the garden? - Maybe I will. - What's the real reason you left the Army? - Come on Pop okay? - Because you have what it takes to be a commanding officer. - And I made the choice to leave. I know how much it means to you that I had a career in the Army and I know mom was proud too. I woke up everyday and I worked for America. - Your mother loved you more than anything else in this world. - I know that. Hey Pop, why don't you put on a tie. Let me take you to dinner. They still got a restaurant in this town that uses white linen right? Please. (country music) (weeping) (wistful music and weeping) - Ty? Ty? Ty! Ty! - Mindy? Mindy is that you? Mindy oh my god you look great! - Oh I'm having a bad day. Oh you're sweaty. - Yeah it's 110 degrees out here. - Oh yeah. God, god it's amazing I can't believe it. I recognize you after what? - Twenty years. - Twenty years. - I know well, you know. I'm the only black man out here in 110 degree weather walking into town. - Yeah I guess that plays a factor. - Sure you're okay? - Small town tragedy. Umm, god well get in the car. (country music) - Whoa get outta town huh big guy. Oh come here look at you huh? Spittin' image man, exactly the same. Cool hat, cool clothes, such a cool guy. Hey you're in town for the reunion? Yeah, molly and I you know, we got two kids. Sarah, she's like a little doll and Barry, well the wife likes Manilow. He's five, never stops talkin'. It's all excellent man. Got a great house, great job, eat well. It's excellent. Say so what's your deal? - I'm good yeah. - Yeah oh let me guess, big CEO of an internet company? Huh, hope it's for the kids? Huge stock options. Oh god. - Listen uh - You still with all the ladies? Yeah god. - Listen uh. - There's no stopping Brad Wellington man. Put it up. Still single. Hey look I gotta get going. The kids are out roasting in the car. Tomorrow night, we'll catch up on old times. - Alright man I'll see you. - Have I got a photo for you. - Of what? - Of that moment, seeing an old friend. - I got no clue who he is. (country music) - Well I mean, I think I look pretty good for 37. At least I don't have secretary butt. - [Ty] You're a secretary? - A legal assistant, jeeze. I mean I look good compared to my husband's friends and their wives. The wives of plastic surgeons, they're like the Stepford Wives. Not me, not a stitch. - As I recall, you wanted to become a doctor. - Yeah well that wasn't realistic. I mean I have had this husband who has the same goals who had the same goals, but you know, someone had to pay the mortgage. It was me. - You gonna tell me why you were crying? - PMS, god I can't believe that this is the first impression you have of me after 20 years. (horn blares) God, I know I know it's been a long time. I mean I used to hear from Patrick. He used to send me postcards from all these exotic places like Haiti and Somalia. Yeah, he stopped writing like three years ago. Anyway, I check in on his dad every now and again. You know his mom died, cancer in the uterus. - Oh wow that's tough. - Yeah. (country music) (gravel grinding) - Look at this gorgeous structure. - [Brad] Yeah. - Oh. - Gorgeous. Hey Jeanie, where do you take most of your photos? - I'm freelance, I travel all over the world. - Planes give me the creeps. - How do you get anywhere? - Well I haven't left San Francisco in three years. - That's funny because I live in San Francisco and I'm never there. - Where are you then? - All over. Provons, Copenhagen. - How long did it take you to get there? - To Denmark it's 14 hours. - You'll never catch me in a plane that long. No fuckin' way. What is that like three plane meals? - How'd you get here then? - Good old trusty train. - Aren't you feelin' a little drunk? - It's only the afternoon. - I feel good. In high school I was the designated drunk driver. - What? - Hmm. (sleepy music) what is a ranger anyway? - Like a forest patroller I think. - What's that got to do with football? - Maybe that's why they're the worst team in their division. - Oh shit. - There's something so beautiful about an empty stadium. - Good old Jimmy B, star quarterback snapped his neck. That's what I think about when I look at this stadium. (grunting) Did you play sports? - No. - I did sports for the sweaty male bonding in the locker room. - Gross, are you gonna smoke that? - Why you want one? - No, nooo. - Hi. - George and who is this? Patrick. - This is him, back for the 20th reunion. - Patrick, do you remember me, Flora? No, I'm sure you don't. - She taught you nursery school. - George, I never thought I'd see you in here in a tie. - Come on Flora give me a break. - Special dinner? Patrick, enjoy your meal. - Thank you. - Good afternoon gentlemen. My name is Roger and I'll be serving you. Can I interest you in a cocktail? - Uhh. - I'll just have something cold in a can. - I'm sorry sir, we don't serve anything in a can here but we do have a lovely array of drafts. - Oh fine, just bring me something cold. - Fantastic. And would you care for something cold? - Vodka martini two olives please. - Man after my own heart. - A far cry from The Pork Pit. (laughs) So what are your plans? - I was thinking the swordfish. After years of knowing, I'm not sure. I could be a great camp counselor. Travel agent. - Well, if you're thinking of sticking around for a while. There's an open door policy at your home. I want you to know that. - Thanks pop. I may take you up on that for a little bit. - A cold one for dad and a cocktail for the son. So what's the occasion if you don't mind my asking? - 20 year high school reunion. - 20 years, get out. Couldn't be more than ten right? First time back in a while? - You could say that. - Umm sticking around or is this just a quickie trip? - I'm not sure yet. - My son just retired from the military. He's a lieutenant colonel. - Oh a military man. - I'm ready to order. - Yes sir. - I'll have the sirloin steak well done, nevermind the fancy sides, just bring me a big potato. - [Waiter] Sirloin well, no leeks and portobello, just a good old baker for dad, and you? - I'd like the swordfish please. - The sword for the retired military man. I'll leave you two alone. - I know you have questions about me retiring. - I made a career in the military and I never wanted to leave early. Those were the best years of my life. - It's time for a fresh start. It's been twenty years. It felt right. - Pat. - Hot buns from the oven. - There's no photo for Jeanie Moran. - I was sick that day. Let's see your photo. - What? - You look the same. If I could be anywhere it would be on the moon by the sea. Fuji Kuo. - Brad Wellington, Ojai prophet. - You could always judge the popular people by the amount of signatures in their yearbook. Wow. You're a popular guy. Let's head out. (twangy music) - Did you write for the high school newspaper? - No, there was no high school newspaper, - [Brad] I know, just testing. Were you on the debate team? - I didn't like high school. - I had you pegged as like a pro high school kind of gal on the debate team, popular at school dances. - I didn't go to the school dances. - That's why we never met. I would have definitely asked you to dance. - I don't think so Brad. - I think so. - Do you remember the back roads to this town? - Umm yeah, how about the rock? You ever been to make-out rock? - I lead a very exciting and full life. - So what you're saying is you've never been to the rock? - It's a rock. - Well if you were gonna remember any location from your Nordoff days, it would be the rock. - I remember this great clearing in the woods and I would go there and I'd day dream and I think that if we cross a bridge and then there's a road. Okay no umm, if we go towards my old house and park there, we can walk and I think that I'll remember it that way. - First of all I need a welcome basket. - Check. - Second, we need at least one vegan dish for the buffet. Every other goddamn person is a vegetarian these days. - Tofu burritos stuffed with tomato and baby eggplants, a vegan orgasm. - Okay, band. Not that horrible trio that you booked for the literary luncheon. - I like the accordion player. - Oh dare I ask who is playing for this event? - Pizazz, you'll love them. - Where do you come up with these bands? Okay, it doesn't matter, because by 10pm the entire class of 1981 is going to be half in the bag and dancing to bad cover tunes. - You nervous? - For what? - Oh come on, you haven't seen some of these people in 20 years. You're the town mayor now. The last time they heard little Margaret was getting caught by the local police in the backseat of some prep school boys car with her undies around her ankles. - But it is all about campaign financing these days. - Are you serious? - Oh we'll talk. - Hey, let's go. - Ta ta. (twangy music and sniffing) - JC! - JC, he works here? - He runs it. - He runs it? - Ty, Ty how's my favorite king of cool? Oh man, got a little sauce on your shirt there, psych! - What's up with the cold JC? Longest cold in history huh, five-year sniffle? - This is is amazing man, you in my pizza place. How many years has it been? - 20 years man. - Wow, and you came here for a slice of my pizza? Are you ready for the best slice of pizza you ever had in your life huh, huh, huh? Listen, you order off this menu. Whatever you want and I'll get it for you. I'll make it for you like that! - Beer? - Beer, come here often? - When Bryan was alive. - You guys were close? - Well you know my husband was never home. Medical school, you know I'd get lonely. - Well pizza, JC, that doesn't make any sense. Now he did something else wasn't he? - Drummer. - That's right he was a drummer. What was the name of the band he was in? - Blue Hunger. Yeah, when Bryan died his family didn't give him much of an option you know? Guilt factor. - Similar to salami slices, totally tofu lasagna? - Well you know, JC wanted to evolve with the times. Safe to say it's not a very big hit. - Now Bryan never married huh? - Nope. - Yeah, I wanted to come to the funeral but I just couldn't bring myself to come here. - You okay JC? - Two piping hot similar-to-salami slices. - Thank you. - JC, what is that? - Kale. - And that is? - Kale you jackass. I did away with Bryan's recipe, too traditional. Basil and sauce, that's wheat crust and I use soy cheese. - [Ty] Nice. - [JC] How the hell are you Mindy? - I've been better. - Oh Mindy. Hey you got a little sauce on your shirt there. - Oh psych. - Listen, I want you guys to come here tonight with any one of Bryan's friends that you see around town for the reunion. Bryan would have liked that. It'll be like you guys were here with Bryan, you know? Like old times. - Yeah. - Everything is on the house huh? - [Mindy] That's sweet JC. - I'll be there. - Look at this, look at this in the middle of a busy street, goddammit. Hello, hurry up yeah come on. (mumbles) - And then there's Margaret. - Oh yes Miss Margaret. - Yeah wow, she put the whole reunion together. She couldn't bear to see the 20 year go by like the 10 year with no fuss. So, here we are. Just happened to fall on a really bad day. Well, the real scoop on Margaret, she's the town mayor. - Margaret? - Yep, town mayor. - Is the mayor of Ojai. Yep and she didn't have to fuck anybody to get there! Well nobody she didn't want to that is. I mean she legitimately climbed the political ladder. Assistant to a councilman, blah blah blah. Are you involved with anyone? - [Ty] Yeah I have a girlfriend. - Do you love her? - I think that's a fairly intimate question. - Oh come on Ty you know we're old high school friends. Come on tell me do you love her? - I like her. - Oh oh I see. But you don't love her right? - It hasn't been an issue. - Right right right. So perhaps she thinks you love her. You ever think of that? And she has no idea you don't love her and just when she thinks you're gonna tell her you love her right, that's when you're gonna dump her right? - I don't know. I don't think we need to be talking about this Mindy. - You guys are all the same. You'll just hold on to her until she's too old to attract anybody who could possibly be any good for her and then you just dump her off into the world right? Right? And then she has to find a man who'll be willing to face the awful odds that one out of every four babies born to older women are retarded. - There are a lot of 37-year-old women who have babies that aren't retarded. - [Mindy] Oh really? And I suppose you think I should just run to LA and get a boob job and let it all hang out, cut my hair and stuff? - Mindy, you don't need a boob job. - [Mindy] What do you advise me to do Ty? I mean why am I asking you anyway? You men are all the same. - Thanks, hey don't forget about my car. - Oh shit let me call that in. - Oh Papasito Chulo, look what you blossomed into. - It's the mayor! - Wait let me look at you. You are one sexy Ojai grad. - I need company. - I know I'm coming. - What's wrong with her? - I know, listen you going to Bocalli's tonight? - Yeah I'll be there. - Okay, mwahh. I will see you later. Okay we have got to get you a briefcase. - See ya, see you later! - Afternoon Jim, Mike. Goddamn democrats are taking over. - I need your signature for the meeting on Thursday. - It's Friday Luisa go home. I'll see you Monday. I'm serious baby take a load off. - Bye. - Have a good weekend. - Bag, bag, bag, bag. Thank you. - Okay. - You got a Valium? Okay let's go! - Holy shit, my house! It's gone. - That's gonna be an ugly shot. Not to mention sad. - Oh life's sad. There's beauty in sadness. - I bet you think that's so artistic. - What's that supposed to mean? I've done some of my best work with a cloud over my head. - Oh there's a big difference between a bad day in happy land and sad. - I've been deeply sad. I've been depressed. - You think you've been depressed. - You know you don't even know me. How can you say I haven't been depressed? - So what was your deal in high school? - I hardly think high school mattered. - Then why are you here? - Just curiosity. - You don't have many friends do ya? - I have plenty of friends now. I think that leads to the orange groves. (triumphant music) (grunting and announcers grumbling) - God why is always so cold in this damn freezer section. I get sick and bam, oh god it just got colder. - Afternoon Mayor. Mindy. - How's the practice Mark? - It's excellent. There's a high level of vanity this year so. This is Trina. - Don't introduce us. I already know Trina. - We have the same nail polish. - Is everything all set? - In stone. - Good, good work. - What? - Good work. - Oh, one of our finest moments. (giggles) - Chocolate fudge swirl. - Oh yum, okay we gotta go. - [Mindy] Don't forget the cherries! - Good idea. - Ice cream, Ice cream! After she wraps her muscular, equestrian legs around him and fucks him like oh he's never had it before! There just each gonna have a little scoop to cool off. - Put some cucumbers on those eyes girl. Just get yourself to Bocalli's, stop crying! - Attention all customers, Mindy is leaving. Mark, have a nice day. - Don't tell me that you made out in the groves too. - What you didn't? - Me and my friends would come down here with big bottle of cheap wine and get sloppy drunk. Swim around on the ground wasted. Just flapping our arms like wings. - This is it. This is where I would come after school and sit just before dark. And I would leave and then you and your friends would pass through. - And we never met until today. - I think that we should go. (romantic music) wait wait. Wait. Wait. Go over there and just sit down. - Here? (guitar strumming) â™« I've seen a rainbow out a rainy day â™« Drink your tears swallow your pride (phone rings) - Hello? - [Charlotte] Hi. - Hey. - [Charlotte] It's Charlotte. I'm calling. - Yeah, you guys decide whether you were coming or not. - [Charlotte] Yes, we'll be there. - Ten minutes right? - [Charlotte] Yeah. - Ten minutes? - [Charlotte] Yes. - Okay, um I'm in room 306 alright. - That was unexpected. - Give me a break. You would have been disappointed if that didn't happen. - (laughs) I hardly think so. You know this was fun. And I think that when we go back to San Francisco that we could have a cup of coffee or a drink or something. - Yeah. - Brad. - I'm a bus driver and you're a glamorous photojournalist. - That's not what I mean. - No, I'm just ordinary and you found a photo experience. A little photo experience to write about in your travel journal, like a reunion memory. - You're kind of an asshole. - Thanks. You sure know how to get a second date. - Are you trying to quit or something? - As a matter of fact I am. - You're so different. - I thought you didn't know who I was. - Boy man do I ever. You were, you were the guy that I dreamed of from 9th grade to senior year. There's a waste. - So you were obsessed with me. - No I was young I guess and lonely and when I saw you at the diner, I didn't even recognize you because you act and you look so different. I guess when I did recognize you I thought it would be a little flare. - So you had a loose end to tie with old Brad. All done now? Off to the reunion, mission accomplished? - I'm not going to the reunion. I came here for the wrong reasons. - Well tell me. - I don't have any friends to see at the reunion. Just a bunch of people that are gonna say, Jeanie, Jeanie is that you? I mean Jesus Christ you blossomed so much and you know you used to look so you know? - So you were the ugly duckling that became a swan? What's so traumatic about that? - You've actually really become an asshole. - So you weren't the prom queen or the class clown but you succeeded right? You're happy right, you're over it right? You're not over it? - I am. I don't care. - No you're not. You slept with me for who I was. Someone who wasn't in your league. That's not a sign of over it. - It was my personal reunion okay? - You came back here to be validated by a bunch of presumably overweight, caddy, undersexed graduates, who you shouldn't even think about twice? Life is strange like that. Hey are you hungry? I wanna go get a slice at Bocalli's. - Yeah I like Bocalli's. - Bryan was one of my best friends. - You know my parents used to take me there every Friday night? It was quality time with their introverted daughter. - So your parents knew you were a loser? - Shut up, I wasn't a loser fucker. - Alright alright. I'd like some more of your company today. - You know what? You're a catch-22. - Is that good? - You know what the worst part of living alone is Pat? The tube. I never watch that crap in my life and now I find myself planning my day around the antique annex, jeeze. It's your mother's fault. She got me hooked. - Pop you ever miss the Army? - Yeah yeah I do. Hell that was my life for 40 years. Luckily I had a family life too. - I'd like to have a family. - Pat what are you talking about? You can't do that. - [Waiter] Are our pallets happy? - Everything is fantastic thank you. Why not? - What do you know about raising kids? - As much as you and mom knew and you raised me. I learned from you guys. - But how are you? This is absurd. Who would be the child's mother? - Pop, I have read a lot of literature on this. A child, - I need some air. (door rapping) - Uh I feel a bit awkward out here. - You know, I've practiced this for years. I even wrote songs about it. - I got Charlotte pregnant, left, and denied it was my child isn't a good title for a song. - None of my songs have titles. Come on have a seat, you're making me nervous. - Better? - Took me a long time to get to this place. And I wanna just tell you. - 20 years for you. A lifetime for your son. I can't speak for him Ty and I don't know what he is gonna say or what he's gonna do when he gets in here, but I can tell you that he is a sweet kid. - Look all I wanna do is hang out with him. I just wanna meet the kid. He could come back with me to LA. - You should know that he is very close to his step dad and that he was worried that coming here would jeopardize that, so you have my husband to thank for telling him that it was okay. - Okay, I'm ashamed already okay? I'm ashamed. Fuck it's 20 years later and I'm back in this town. It's like we're back in high school again. You want me to explain to you what happened? You want me to tell you. - Not to me! Tell it to your son. I have to go. - Charlotte. - I have to go. - Charlotte! Thank you. - Sure. - You smoke? - Under duress, yes I smoke. - Can I have one? I smoke under duress too. Pop how old are these? - I got them when the Vietnamese withdrew from Cambodia. - 1989? Pop. - Patrick, I prayed that the Army would straighten you out. Sharing hardships with the other men defending your country. - Pop. - I went 32 days without a bath in Korea. - Pop, I told. - You told? - I told. I couldn't keep it inside any longer. I couldn't pretend, couldn't lie about who I am, what I am. - You fool. - No I am not a fool. It's the United States Army that's a fool. One night I told a superior. That was it. - Oh boy. Drive me home. Patrick, I always bragged about you to my peers. Hell I bragged about you to anybody who'd listen to a broke down old noncom. My son in Operation Desert Shield. My son in Operation Desert Storm. My service in Korea was one of the three proudest accomplishments of my life. - What were the other two? - The day I married your mother and the day you were born. (door slams) - I love you Pop. (playful music) - I know this evening is to be one of joviality but it also one of remembrance. Two people aren't with us today. A Mr. Jim Friday. I wish I could say I was one of Jim's best students but math and I well, we were incompatible. But Mr. Friday was as devoted and patient with me, as he was with all his students. We miss him. Yes, we all knew Bryan. Bryan Noonan ahhh. Bryan was not only a close, personal friend of mine, he was also a star football player, an A student, and a tremendous pizza maker. Someone I always went to for advice. He is greatly missed. How was that Bryan? You'd be writing the speech for me if you were here. Yeah I know I'll be alright. Take care of yourself. (cheering and whistles) (door clangs) - I lost my earring. - Forget it. - Be right with you folks. Can I get you anything else Mr. Lewis? - This isn't Ricotta. - It's tofu but I swear it tastes just like the real deal. - You got garlic bread right? - I forgot the garlic bread. Two seconds Mr. Lewis, one more minute folks. - That's Bryan's younger brother. I wonder what he's workin' here for. - You know I think that Bryan used to deliver pizza to my house. He was cute. - Yeah he's alright. - Brad. Brad holy fucking shit it's Brad hey man! You got a little bit of sauce on your shirt there. Hey Mr. Lewis this is Brad, he was Bryan's friend in high school. - This is Jeanie. - Lovely wife Brad, pleased to meet you Jeanie. - She's not my wife. We actually just met. She's a graduate of Nordoff. - Your brother used to deliver pizza to my house. - JC, your making pizza now? Last time I saw you you were banging on them drums. - Someone's gotta make a the pizza. - Yeah Bryan, what about Bryan, where's Bryan? - What? This isn't your idea of a joke? So you don't know? Oh wow, I thought everybody had found out one way or another - What what are you talking about? - Bryan was killed. - What? - Hit and run. - You're fucking with me right? - I took over the joint five years ago. My folks tried to get ahold of you. Margaret, she tried. There was no trace of you. Jeanie, can I get you anything? - Yeah I could use a big glass of read wine and a slice. - Here to please. - This is fucked. - Tell me about it. I lose my brother and get his career all in the same week. (inspirational music) - JC! Oh it's Brad Wellington. Brad Wellington, ohhhh. It's Brad Wellington. - You're all grown up. - Yes and I sure wish I would stop growing. - Hey I just hear about Bryan and I'm really sorry. - You're acting like I'm the widow. You were on the cheerleading squad, top pyramid right? Oh god then why do I know your face? It's not important, I know you now. Mindy Water, Mindy. - Jeanie Moran. Now were you the Mindy that changed her hair color? - That's me, I was a red head, a brunette, and a blonde all in my senior year. God, good memory. I've been a blonde way too long. - How about jet black? - Yeah in your silly girl fantasies. Wow, Brad we don't want to talk about Bryan's death anymore. I mean, it's been a long time. Thanks. Especially this weekend. Come on, it's our high school reunion. - Mindy you want a slice? - Definitely not. - Brad? - Yeah whatever. - [JC] How about garden pepperoni? - Sure. - You know it was a bitch for Margaret to find you. Where you been? - I been driving a public bus in San Francisco. - You what? - I'm a civil servant. I drive a public bus. - Would you be shocked if I told you that I'm relieved? - Relieved why's that? - Well, because my life hasn't exactly like I thought it would either. I need some wine JC. (door rapping) - Hey. - How you doing? - How's it going? - Not bad. - Come on in. - Thanks dad. Guess I just wanted to hear that out loud you know. Is this your guitar? - Yeah. - You mind? - Go ahead. (strings ring) - I never really practiced. So uh, how is LA? Meet Lenny Kravitz or anybody? - Nah. I play with some pretty cool people though. You know every now and then it's, I have a good time. Um, it's been pretty good. You play that thing much? - Yeah sometimes. Not that much though you know? It shows. You sure are black. - What'd you expect. - True. I got your nose. Definitely got moms eyes though, definitely. - You know you're tall like my father. - Grandpa, sounds funny. So you had a thing for white women huh? - Well you know, besides your mother, umm you know, there are not a lot of black folks in this town. - Tell me about it. - [Ty] Yeah, you got a girlfriend? - Yeah, yeah I do. She's real cool, real cool. - She's white? - Why do you ask I mean, you think I'm gonna get her pregnant or something? Skip out on her? What? - No, you know, it's just kinda strange and I know you know this but it's 20 years, 20 years and uh here you are. - I'm not here for the whole bonding experience you know. It's, we may find out we don't even like each other, It's not important, you know what's important to me is that I found out, I found out who I am, where I come from you know? That's that's the most important part. - You pretty smart huh? - I like to think so yeah. Well uh, I gotta head out. I told some friends I was gonna meet up with them you know later, do some stuff. I guess I'm out. - It's nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you too. I'll be in touch. - Okay Michael. Your mother has my number. - Right right, take it easy. (yelling and honky tonk music) - Happiest day of my life, well not the happiest but one of extreme clarity, was when I discovered red wine. I mean red wine was my lover so many times. I mean don't get me wrong. I'm not a wino or anything but red wine is good when you're down, but it's also good among best friends. - Down goes Frazier! - Bryan's death just ripped JC to pieces. I mean he hasn't been the same since. - He's um, he's jumpy. (sniffs) - JC is doing cocaine Brad. - Really? - Ding ding ding gee Brad driving the bus sure has stamped out a few brain cells. - Oh thanks Mindy. - Well I mean he's amped. (whispers) - What? - Holy shit Patrick! - Oh! Hey, Brad. God I am so happy to see all you guys here. Hey JC. - Hey Pat. - How are you? - Good. - Hey this is my first chance to offer condolences. I regretted missing the funeral everyday since the day. - What is it with you people? I don't wanna talk about Bryan's death all night long. Mayor. - The golden boy finally graces us with his presence. Where have you been? - I been around. - My personal Richard Gere. (whistles and cheering) (wistful music) Oh and I know you, Jeanie Moran. Who the hell do you know in this group? - I'm with Brad. - Well I had no idea you and Brad were friends? - [Jeanie] Yeah we met today and Bonnie Lou's. - Don't tell me you slept with Jeanie too. - You're funny. I should have considering I graduated high school because of her. Chemistry was not my favorite subject. - I did let you cheat didn't I? - Yeah you saved my ass on that final exam. - [Jeanie] Well I liked helping you. You had all the guys. - Every single one of them. - Hey respect the town's mayor. Jeeze. (cheering and whistles) (chattering) - You were free. I mean a self-employed artist. - And you like the military. - And your friends must love that. (chattering) - The family game. - Thumper! - And we play! - Why do we play? - [Group] To get fucked up! - That's you Brad. - You guys actually think I'm gonna remember my sign from a stupid high school drinking game? - Well I know it's kind of stupid but I remember I was finger and ear. - Okay there you go, Brad come on show show us your sign. Ty, everybody everybody show us your sign. - What are you doing Margaret? We're not in high school anymore. - I'm trying to be nostalgic Brad. - Yeah, I'll just drink too much and barf on the floor. Ty will run off with his guitar and not join the group. Mindy will cling to her future husband. You'll get on your back somewhere in some field and Bryan will, Bryan's fucking dead. He won't be able to participate in this little exercise. Then we will have captured 1981. Jeanie, you're like the mystery graduate. What would you be doing? - If you're so interested in now Brad, what brought you here? - Curiosity. - Okay so if you're so curious about how we evolved over the last 20 years, I''ll be so bold as to start. I'm not clinging to that damn lying husband of mine anymore because he just divorced me. It's official today. So I'm the one who was left behind. - Maybe we should get you that condo in Santa Barbara. - That bastard is not gonna kick me out of my hometown into some divorcee's suburb like Santa Barbara. - Why do we have to do this? Why can't we just hang out? - Why, what's the point? - Because that's what reunions are for. - This is private reunion Patrick among so-called best high school friends. - Okay, I'm gay. (laughter) And I was gay in high school. So like Mindy, I have also stayed the same yet dramatically changed. - How have you changed? - I told the Army I was gay and I was asked to leave. - What did your father say? - He thinks I'm gonna be bringing home strange teenage boys in hula skirts and makeup at all hours of the night. He's so pissed. - Your father has a very vivid imagination or you do. - Well if he could imagine such a thing, he would have. (laughter) - Okay, now that we've gone through this Mr. Passive Aggressive, what ever happened to you, golden boy? - No wait please you guys wait. I can't stand it. This is so great you guys. - This is great. - I have a confession. I was Weenie Jeanie. - Who's that? - The biggest loser of 1981. - No way. - Way. - I slept with Weenie Jeanie. - Yes Brad you did but I wasn't a loser and I don't know why some people are the losers. I mean how does that get determined year after year after year, generation after generation? I mean, I mean it makes you scared that your kid will be the one that's the chosen one, the loser. You know it's horrible. I mean I don't know what I would do if some kid picked some awful name to call my child. I mean it would break my heart. - I thought you were kind of hot in a gawky way. - You knew who I was all along? - No but I remember you now and I remember, I remember you in homeroom and I remember you in the cafeteria and I remember you in the library all alone hiding all crunched up over in your cubicle with your hair in your face. You never smiled at anybody or anything. And I kind of thought maybe you might have been a bit retarded. (laughter) - This is sick. What are you a stalker? (laughter) - It's like destiny. I mean they finally found each other. So sweet. (laughter) - I love making pizza but I fucking suck at it. My brother Bryan, he was good at making pizza. He was the best at making pizza. Okay you people tell me what do I do that makes any difference? What do I do that matters? - You're a great drummer. - You guys are getting me all emotional, excuse me. - You're good at snorting coke. - Shit. - Hey you know, I mean you're a great drummer and you're an amazing friend. - And you know how to run a business. - I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna quit the coke. - Yeah you should. - I'm gonna get my life together. - Yeah and the pizza is gonna be better too. Okay people, what do you say we cool off a little bit. - Hold on a second, I started this whole raw exposing thing, so I might as well tell you about my hard fall from perfection. The mark I left on you 20 years ago, it's all bullshit. - You know you're too hard on yourself and I barely know you - Thanks Jeanie, thanks but I've been basically unimpressed with myself. - You know I think we always have this illusion of what we were and what we're gonna be. None of it ever adds up. - Yeah, it's called a midlife crisis. - I'm not blaming my problems on any timeline theory Margaret or anybody for that matter. And Jeanie, when I thought you didn't know me, I relaxed a little bit. I hadn't relaxed like that in a while. - It seems like we're taking this whole reunion thing a little too seriously. I mean it seems like this final judgment you know, judgment day or something. It's really just a silly banquet with bad music. - Hey! - I mean a killer time with everything perfect. - Yeah. (laughter) - What I'm saying is, it's just a marker. I mean it's just a 20-year marker that brought us all back together again. I mean we may not even see each other again until the next reunion. So who gives a shit what anyone thinks about anyone? An excuse for us to pretend we're in high school again. I don't think it could be any more than that. - I'll drink to that. - I think we're being too hard on ourselves. I think we should try to have some more fun. I do. (sniffles) Let's have some fun. I'm gonna try. - [Jeanie] You're gonna do it. - I can. (inspirational music) (giggling) - You got the key, mayor? Okay go. (suspenseful music) (screaming and laughing) (Cuban music) - You know folks, I'm not coming to the reunion. - Why? - I'm going back to LA, I can't take this town man. - Personally I can't wait. I'm dying to see how fat and lame those people are that weren't so nice to me. (collective chuckle) Hey you wanna be my date? - I don't know I was kind of thinking of taking the mayor. You know, get me some action at the reunion. - You have been a riot all night. I told you I have no room for you in my little black book anymore. - What do you mean? This town doesn't know about you and your little past and all your little boyfriends. - What she is very discreet? - I can't go to the reunion I mean, Mark's gonna be there with his new item. No I can't, I'm just not strong enough. I'm gonna buy myself a ticket to Antigua. - I'm gonna quit the coke guys. (laughter) No I really mean it and I'm gonna sell the pizza place. - So it's Jeanie and me at the party tonight. - [Patrick] And me. - Good for you Patrick. - If I'm gonna think about moving back here, I'm gonna hang out with the locals. - Oh that'll be dangerous for your IQ. - Okay stop dissing the town. This is a good town. (wistful piano music) Good evening class of 1981. Welcome, welcome. I spent some time with my best friends from high school last night. We haven't hung around each other in a group since, that last summer after graduation. (sighs) You see these people all grown up now. And you realize no matter where you go or what you learn or how much you think you've changed, you are basically the same person with the same needs and expectations. We all moaned and groaned a little bit now and then. Then and now, but we had some fun. I don't know what will change for any of us in this room. I wish you all the best. It's been so damn long and I don't think any one of us know who we really are. Still, this is your night class of 1981. You have a good night. (inspirational music) - Well the golden boy finally graces us with his presence. Where have you been? - I've been around. - And my own personal Richard Gere. - I am neither and officer or a gentleman. - I bet. Thank you madame. I know you.
