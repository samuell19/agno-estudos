(planet humming) (graphic chiming) (birds chirping) - [Nora] This is my favorite poem. Do you like it? - I don't know. I don't know it. - It's called, "Bursting Embers". It's special to me. - I don't remember that one. Did that Walt Whitman guy write it? - No, silly. That poetry teacher it looks like I should be subbing more. - I like it when you sub. - So do I. Mr. Marciello, he's never around. He wants me home with the children more. - Yeah, where are they? - Nikko and Nora, they're playing upstairs. They're a good team together. I wanna share this poem with you. May I? - Yeah, I like it when you read. Should I close my eyes like before? - Yeah, sit back. Feel the energy. The red of passion has pulled below surging, coursing, flowing through, a tender face, skin so white as. - What's the matter? Do you hear something? - Nah, it's just hard to focus in here. It's very stuffy in here. The lighting's better and softer upstairs. - Nah, I don't think I should. - Shh, shh, shh, relax. It's okay. It's just poetry. - What about Mr. Marciello? - He won't be home for hours. You know, college president. He's never home anymore. It's just me, the children, and poetry. - I don't know. I don't wanna get in trouble. Just a freshman here. - No, Donny, don't be silly, nothing will happen. Besides I'm the wife of the college president, doesn't that give me any clout? - Yeah, I guess you're right. - Yeah. Okay, take my hand. Let's bring the energy with us. - Okay. - Here, sit here. Take your shoes and socks off. The red of passion has pulled below, surging, coursing flowing through. A tender face, skin so white, would flush with passion's glow. - Feels nice. - [Nora] The glow is so fine and delicate threads has spread beyond the plain. It lies and waits for passion barb to drive its master home. - Oh, yeah. - Wait, can you feel what the energy is? This poem it's moving you, I can tell. Let me finish my poem. Once home the master must wait for all is not at once. To savor. Sip. Taste the fruit. There's joy once held by all. But now the day when passion begs. To shed its needful way. The powers to beg, to use, to find our hidden stay. (birds chirping) (sultry music) (birds chirping) (sultry music) (birds chirping) (sultry music) (birds chirping) (door clicks) (door bangs) - Nora, it's the middle of the day, what? - Oh, god, Frank. Thank god, you're home. He asked me to help him with poetry. - What the hell is this? Huh? What the fuck is this? - He asked me to help him. - Who you think you are you little fucking prick? - Hey, man, she told me to come up here. - Frank, he's lying. - Shut up! (body thuds) - [Donny] I ain't see nothing, man. I ain't do nothing. - You ain't doing nowhere. Where you going boy, huh? You going somewhere? You in a hurry, huh? You in a hurry? You come in all of 30 seconds. (body thuds) Come on, boy, come on. You weren't in a hurry when you were fucking my wife. - Stop it, Frank! - Come on, man! You fuck my wife on my bed and you wanna leave so quickly. Get up, 'cause I'm gonna kill you. And you look at me. - Stop it, Frank. - You look at me you're fucking that guy! - Frank, stop it! (Donny groaning) (Frank laughing) - Shut up, 'cause you're fucking next! Come on! Where you going, boy? How's that feel? A little rough, doesn't it? Faggot. Huh? You like fucking my wife, huh? You like her big titties? You like 'em, huh? Come on, say something now! (Frank grunting) (Frank grunting) Jesus Christ. (Nora grunts) (knife thuds) (Frank groaning) (Frank screaming) - Nikko, Nora. Oh my god. (Nora crying) (brooding music) (Nora crying) (group vocalizing) (Nora crying) (group vocalizing) (Nora crying) (man laughing) (heavy metal music) ♪ Ship flies in tonight ♪ ♪ From the faces, single file ♪ ♪ Dancing in the shadows ♪ - You know, uh, we'll spare sheets. Maybe go for a coffee of something like that. ♪ Eat all ♪ - Hey. ♪ Just stay out of it when ♪ ♪ People try ♪ - [Justin] Hey Walter, did you get any last night? - Last night, man, what about this morning? A little sunrise special? (group laughing) - I didn't really like her. She was so forward. Look buddy, forward's better than backwards. You know what I'm saying? - Hey, my roommate said, "He saw that new poetry teacher, Ms. Crane." He said, "She is hot." - Right, man. Give me a fucking break, a hot English professor? Shit ain't gonna happen. Walter. - Get a life, Walter. English teachers come in one of two versions, if they're men they're gay guys in tweedy jackets. And if the woman they're old and pinched up with that library smell. - Dude, what the hell's a library smell? - You know, man, when you were a kid, you used to spend time hiding out in the library, sniffing the insides of the bindings of books. Well, that's what it smells like. - Yeah, that's, that's a little more than we needed to know, man. - Nah, man, I heard it too. She's supposed to be quite a package. Nice tits and a great ass. - What the fuck is up with you guys? - [Jason] Whoa, someone's pissed. - [Justin] Look out, Jason, it'll be heading your way. - Screw you. You're acting like a bunch of adolescents. - Ah. (blows raspberry) No, you're an adolescent. - Someone's upset that she's losing her title of whore du jour. - Ooh, ooh. - Oh really? Why don't you and your wrestling bud go fuck yourselves since that's what you do anyway isn't? - I think she misses the finer points of the ancient sport. - All right, Josh, give it a fucking rest, all right? - I'll tell you guys, I saw her down in the president's office, she's fat man. - No, my roommate said, "She's really slender." (group laughing) - Oh Walter, we can always count on you to keep it real. - It's not like you guys haven't seen a pretty girl before, so why do you have to be so gross about it? - We're not being gross, we're being guys. - Seems to me, the only person who's acting like a man around here is Walter. - Ah. Well, you know, I guess standards just ain't what they used to be. - Well, I heard she transferred from another college. - Whoa, okay, who let the freshman speak? - Permission was not granted. (Brad laughs) (paper thudding) - I just assumed- - Ouch, violation number two. - Pledge, refrain from vocalizing without permission. - Yeah, shut up. (group laughing) - Were they always like this? - Always. - Hey, can we get back to talking about her ass? - The day we have a poetry teacher with a nice ass is the day that. - A nice ass? Well, I hope I can be more than that. Good morning. I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Ms. Nora Crane. I will be your instructor here for the remainder of the semester. I'm glad to join the faculty here at Omega Prep, and I look forward to our time together this year. Poetry has been a chief love of mine for many years. The words, the rhythm, the energy of poetry can do amazing things. I hope to bring the joy of poetry into each and every one of you. I want us to develop a relationship that is powerful and intimate. - [Walter] Excuse me, Ms. Crane. - Yes. - Will there be a midterm? - Walter, shut up. What the fuck? - (scoffs) Idiot. - What's your name? - Walter, Walter Merrick. - Well, Walter, assessment of learning is crucial, but I hope to find much more creative ways of finding out what you know and what you're able to do. - Uh, Ms. Crane, you'll find the guys here at Omega Prep do really good creative. (group laughing) - I can tell that already. At my last school, I was able to involve many of my best students in a poet society. The purpose of our group was to gather like minds, to think and share the power of verse. We met as often as we could to enlarge our horizons and swell our minds. - I think I'm gonna be sick. - If there is interest here, as I suspect there will be, I've planned to pull together a poet society here at Omega right away. It seems we have a unique location already designed for our meetings. - The Lambda Chi house, yeah. - Yeah! - Not exactly. It seems the ancestral caves of the local Passamasoute Tribe are close to campus. The Passamasoute actually used those caves for sacred and secret ceremonies involving the retelling of tribal verse and manly rights of passage. - Uh, no pledges allowed, right? - Well, the poets society will be what we make of it. It's up to all of you how intimate it becomes. Let's begin today's lecture. Those interested in the poet society come see me after class. Open your anthologies to page 443, the poem titled, "Stiff Wooden Soldier". (group laughing) It worked perfectly. It was easier than the last school. I talked about the poet society and their eager little eyes just lit up. I think it's safe to say as men, they rose to the occasion. - Gee, Nora, you're a funny sister, and you're so smart too. - Thanks, Nikko. With the two of us this always works out fine. Must say I like this garden getup much better than that food service geek you were last time. - Uh, thanks, Nora. I like it better too, because it gives me more time to be on outside with the birds and the grass. - Don't go soft on me now! We have plenty of work to do. My class is full of 'em. - Really, Nora, full of 'em? - Lots, and they're ready to go. - Ooh. Do you think there are any nice ones? - Nikko, don't be stupid! There aren't any nice ones! - No, I just thought I could have a friend, Nora. - No, you can't have a friend! God, Nikko, why do I have to go over this so many times? They're all bad. They're all dirty. All they talk about is sex. All they think about is getting some and I'm gonna give 'em some! - I just want a friend who- - When you talk like this you're totally disrespecting our mother and father! You know what happened. You know what those guys did. They're all dirty. They all will pay! (Nora sighs) Anyways, Nikko, I'm your friend. I'll take care of you. - I know you're right, Nora, it's just that- - Quick, one of my students is coming. Go rake or something. - Uh, excuse me, Ms. Crane. - Yes. - Um, I was just wondering- - You're in my poetry class, aren't you? - Yeah. Why you remember me? - How could I forget a face like that? What's your name? - Jimmy. Jimmy Sparks. - Well, hello, Mr. Sparks. - Um, you can call me Jimmy. - Well, then you just call me Nora. - Okay. - Jimmy, come sit with me for a moment. - You, you know, I, I, I wanted to ask you about poet society at your last school. - My last school? - Yeah, the guys, I mean your students must have been really lucky to have something, you know that great. - Oh, yes, they got a lot out of it. - Yeah, it's great you wanna start one here and all too. - Really? - Yeah. Guys would be dying to get in it. - You think so? - I would. - You're sweet, and also very handsome. Let me tell you something, get the feeling that you really like poetry. - I, I do. - And that you really understand what this poet society's all about. - Definitely. - Why don't you join me for the first meeting tonight? - Really? Me? I don't know, I'm, I'm just a freshman. - All the better you have that spark, that energy. The society needs you. - Um, wouldn't the other guys get a little angry though? - Jimmy, I'll take care of the other guys. You don't worry. You just bring your sharp mind and your smiling face. - Awesome. Um, what time? Where? - After dusk. You know the woods behind the stadium? - Yeah. - Follow the trail up over the hill. Off to the right is the entrance to the cave. We'll be in there. - Wow. Thanks, miss, I mean Nora. Um. - Don't thank me. It's your own wonderful qualities that have brought us together. I want this to be very special. - I gotta go. I'm gonna be late for class. Um, thanks, thanks a lot. Um, I'll, I'll see you tomorrow. - See you tonight, Sparky. Sometimes this is just too easy. (ominous music) - [Jimmy] Ms. Crane, are you in there? - Right this way, Jimmy. Come sit down. - Uh, this place is really, oh, I, I mean, hi, how you doing. Ms. Crane? - Didn't we cover this before? It's Nora. The artifacts reflect the ancient people who once used this cave as a sacred meeting place. - Really? - Yes. Young men of the tribe used to come to this cave to come of age. - Awesome. Where are the other guys? - Didn't I tell you to take care of them? They'll be here later. Why don't you take off your shoes and socks? - What? Uh, why? - Well, this technique always works. The ancients used it, trust me. Now relax. Close your eyes. Through ancient ways in nature's layer. Pull from the man the struggle thoughts. Just breathe. Just look. Just love. - Oh, Nora, I never had a teacher like you before. - You're such a charmer. Now let's get down to business. I wanna start your initiation into the poet society right away. - Already? - Well, that way you'll be on the way before the other boys arrive. - Oh, well, I don't know. Whatever you say. - Take off your shirt. - What? - For the initiation, silly. - Okay. - Now there, come a little closer to me. Relax and breathe deeply. Give me your hands. Close your eyes. Repeat after me. The poet's pen I love to hold. - The poet's pen and I love to hold. - Yet sacred more the words he molds. - It's sacred more the words he molds. - To prove my love for bard's own verse. - [Jimmy] To prove my love for bard's own verse - I share his pain, quick, taut, and terse. - Share his pain, quick, taut, and terse. Ah, ah. - It's okay, it's just a pen prick. Let me see. (lips smack) Just like when you're a boy at camp. - I didn't go to camp. - Let me see. There's my poetic warrior. - Oh, if you say so. - Now just relax. You finished the first part. - [Jimmy] I did. - Yeah, come sit over here with your back to me. - Huh? - Now just relax and breathe deeply. Oh, Eros' wings take flight. Take flight. Help us all to allude the night. The night of darkness we fear so well, they cannot escape the lover's bell. The bell that rings for souls so pure. - Wow. - So innocent, so free. So mindful, so sure. The not expecting the final cure. (Jimmy groaning) - What are you doing? No, I can't- - Cure that is swift and true. - I, I can't breathe. - Given to those who just deserve. - Lord, my god, I can't breathe. (Jimmy groaning) (groans) Let go. (groaning) Let go. I don't wanna be in this poet society anymore. (suspenseful music) (Jimmy groaning) (Jimmy coughing) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (Jimmy coughing) - Do him like Daddy did. (Jimmy groaning) (Jimmy groaning) (Jimmy gurgling) (Jimmy coughing) (Jimmy gasping) (Jimmy groaning) (ominous music) Good work, Nikko. Our father would've been proud. - [Nikko] Thanks, Nora. You got everything ready though? - Yeah, well, whatever. Will you take care of this one, will ya? This little shit wore me out. I'm gonna go lie down. - Okay, Nora. - [Nora] Well, see ya. - Bye, Nora. (brooding music) (group vocalizing) (group vocalizing) (group vocalizing) (group vocalizing) - Dude, why is it taking him six years to graduate? - 'Cause I did a year abroad. - Shithead, south Jersey- - Living in your grandmother's trailer- - Is not abroad. (laughs) - Fuck you. - Hey, speaking of a broad. - Ain't she though. I think that Ms. Nora kind of adds a little something special to this learning shit. - I think this takes college education to a whole new level. - Yeah, my old man, I had no idea he was paying for this. (group laughing) - Hey, you think I could use porn on my scholarship on Trojans? - Yeah, and call 'em study aids. (Danny laughing) - Hey, uh, where's our little, uh, pledge Jimmy? - You're right. Where is he? I didn't even notice he was gone. - He told me, "He was going to that cave last night." - What the fuck? Did we get shown up by that kid? - Justin, man, don't even worry about it. He didn't come to class because it was, it was over his head. He didn't wanna show up and embarrass himself today. - Yeah, and besides she's not gonna waste her time with a freshman. - Well, if we're smart, we're not gonna waste any time either. Let a fucking pledge beat us to the punch. I'm signing up today. Are you in bro? - You know I'm there, just don't tell Kathy. - Oh, so now you're all big fucking fans of poetry. You don't even know the difference between a simile and a metaphor. - Don't try to trick me. We don't study those countries in this class. (Donna and Jason laughing) - I don't know what's going on with you guys. It's like you're not the same at all. - I still think you're pretty, Donna. - Thank you, Walter. - But I still wanna join the poet society though. I think I'd learn a lot. - Gee, Walter, maybe you can carry the flashlight for Adam and Josh. - Hey, Jonathan, wake up! - Oh yeah, sounds, uh, real cool guys, but, uh, it's really not for me. Besides I got a good thing going with Shelly and I don't wanna mess it up. - [Evan] Suit yourself, man. - You're gonna miss out on some major action. (ominous music) - [Nora] Hey, Nikko, over here now! - Hi, Nora. How was class today? - Doesn't change much, Nikko. So little time, so much pent-up hatred to spew forth on the world. - Oh. - (sighs) There's more work at this place than I thought. This one at a time shit ain't gonna fly. We need to start increasing volume and I mean soon. - Sure. Nora, whatever you say. - Great, 'cause I got three of 'em showing up to tonight, and I'm gonna need your help. - Really, Nora, three? - Yeah, and two of them are the captains of the wrestling team. - Oh boy, wrestlers. Oh, can I think of something special, Nora? - (sighs) Sure, you can think of something special. - Oh great, I have lots of good ideas. Um, first, we can have 'em- - Nikko, zip it! I'm in a rush. You can tell me later. - Okay, Nora. Um, do you think I can have one of my own this time? - You know, I promised you. You just need to be a little patient. Be plenty for both of us. Can you be patient a little more for me? - Okay, Nora. Whatever you say. - Good, 'cause I gotta go run to get ready. We need to start thinking about how we're gonna start increasing volume. We need to plan and we need it soon. - Okay, Nora. Um, I'll start thinking about it real hard. - Great. Nikko. - Yeah, Nora. - [Nora] Missed weed over there. - Thanks, Nora. Bye. (ominous music) - Oh, noble hearts bleed no more. The warrior must find his sacred home. The caves of King Passamasoute must be cleansed with the blood of those who become men. - Wow, powerful. - You think so? - Yeah. - Hey, Josh, you try. - Men step, step forward and remove your shield. The, the, the way is clear to sow the field. Oh, (chuckles) sow the field. With each man's seed to plant the fruit in each with. - Speed. - Speed. - I like how this sounds. - Look not upon another, another's mate. King Pass, Passamasoute will seal his fate. Oh, fate. With bloody vengeance will come the day that men who still act boy will surely pay. - Awesome. - It's awfully bloody and violent. - Actually the Passamasoute were known for their strict code of male behavior. Many of these translated poems grew out of rituals performed in caves just like these. These rituals confronted and challenged the young men of the tribe to uphold tribal laws of honor, conduct, and respect for women. - Like on "Jerry Springer"? - Let me read you an example. (ominous music) They had taken more wife than one in spite tribal please. Brought here before the sacred pyre were tied the evil three. Tied as one, they were told to fight until but one could breathe. The evil three fought with ropes like warriors, true to heart until the cave ran red with blood. - They had to kill each other? - Death was their punishment for lying, cheating, and screwing around. - Man, I'd be fucked back in those days. - Yeah. - (sighs) Well, I think y'all are ready to move on to a deeper level. Take off your shirts. - What? - It's part of the ancient process. Will help us get in touch with the natural energy of these caves. - I gotta go. I just remembered this test. Um, the library. I, I gotta go. - You sure? It's the best part. Bye. What's wrong with him? - (chuckles) You don't even wanna know. (suspenseful music) - Relax, oh, restful stallion, your toil has made you weak. The sweat, the tears, the furrowed brow. You know, you two are so advanced, I'd really like to take this to a deeper level. Take off your pants. There now, my two warriors, you just relax. Here it is just like you wanted. (Josh groaning) Nikko! Nikko! - [Nikko] Nora. Remember, like I said before. - Didn't you hear that poem I used? You should grow up. - [Nikko] We can do that special thing now, Nora? - Yes. (foot thuds) - Holy shit. - What happened? - I call it the advanced level. (Nikko giggling) The rules are simple. The ancient Passamasoute were not complicated. Fight to the death for my honor. We know at least one of you cheats on their woman. Will have the winner as my own, and I will reward him greatly. Nikko and I will stand to watch. - Who the fuck is Nikko? - I'm the local tribal elder. (giggling) - [Nora] Let the games begin. - What games? - Come on. - You guys are- - Come on. - Fucking crazy. - Come on fight. - Come on. - Come on fight. - Fight, fight! - Fight. - Listen, these people are fucking crazy. Pretend to choke me out. - [Josh] What? - Pretend to choke me out. I'll pretend to dead. And then I'll grab Nikko with the knife. - Yeah, but what if- - Just do it. (Adam groaning) (Adam groaning) (fist thuds) (fist thuds) (fist thuds) (fist thuds) (fist thuds) (fist thuds) (Adam grunting) (hand thuds) (Josh groaning) (hands slap) (hands slapping) (Josh groaning) (Josh grunting) (Adam groaning) What are you doing? Stop! I can't breathe. (groaning) Stop. (Adam groaning) (Josh grunts) (Adam groans) - My warrior is victorious. - Fucker! (Nora groaning) - Nikko, Nikko! (Nora grunting) (Nora coughing) (Josh groaning) (Josh groaning) (suspenseful music) Jocks are so stupid! (Josh groaning) (Josh groaning) (body thuds) Come on, Nikko, let's go back to campus. (Nikko giggling) (Adam coughing) - Josh. Josh. Josh, get the fuck off me, man. Josh. Josh. Stupid ass. What the fuck did you do? Stupid shit. Fuck, fuck! Fuck! That wasn't the plan. - Well, this is! (suspenseful music) (Adam coughing) Now that's what I call a sporting event. (Nikko laughs) Come on, Nikko, let's go. (ominous music) (ominous music) Where are they now? We hear the cry. Our missing souls escape the sigh. The pain of loss so hard to bear. Ask not, but why? But who, but when? But where? Well, that's enough for today class. Remember that the exam is Monday, and that I want you to be ready. I know that many of you have been working very hard, much of it on your own time. Many have taken advantage of the poet society meetings to go deeper into the work. - Yeah, where are they now? - Kathy said, "That Adam never called her last night." - [Nora] Simply attending the occasional poet society meeting may not be enough. - Or it may be too much. - Walter, will you shut up? - So I wanna make it clear. - I'm trying to learn. - That is important to me that I give each and every one of you the extra help and assistance you need. I'll be happy to make myself available for individual tutoring appointments. That way those who need careful one-on-one attention can get it. - [Jason] (sighs) Just what I want. Ugh, Donna's gonna kill me. Fuck it, I'll live. - [Kevin] Oh yeah, baby. Right after practice. - [Danny] Cool, I could be ready by eight. She's gonna love my hair. - [Walter] I think I'm gonna throw up. - I've always believed in this kind of tutoring can make a difference and I've seen results. I want you to know as my students that you're gonna get what you deserve. - I like the sound of that. - Yeah. - Those who are interested come to the front of the class and sign up. Class dismissed. - [Danny] Where do I sigh? - But what about the poet society? They told me, "That's where they were going." - Look, little wannabe frat bro, I appreciate your concern, but you got it ass backwards. Nora's looking for something good from those guys. It ain't what you think. - What's up? - What's going on? - I was there. - What are you talking about? - It's Walter, man- - I know she did it. - Pretending he's on the "X Files" - She takes them to the caves, seduces them, and then kills them. No, no, I didn't see it. I ran off when she started getting, you know, was sexual. (both laughing) - Give it up, Agent Scully. (chuckles) - Besides she's coming over to the frat house tonight, to hold individual appointments. The guys are all signed up. So that proves your theory's full of shit. Oh, I see. She's, she's planning her, her big finale there. (both laughing) Yeah, well, it's been a real sweet moment, but we gotta go. Stay real, little one. - Later. - Ah, man. - Frickin' Walter, man. - Fucking idiot. - Hello? Hello? Those idiots hung up. (phone bangs) No one will fucking believe me. - [Nikko] Hello. - Hello. - What's up? - You have no idea. Do you know what it's like to not have anybody listen to you? To be ordered around? To have to do all the dirty work? Shit! - No, I do know. I do know. My sister, she treats me real bad sometimes, but I guess it's because she cares about me so much. It really sucks, huh? You look pretty upset. Do you need my help? - I don't. It's that new poetry teacher, Nora Crane, she's evil, I know it. She's got this poet society thing. She invites guys to the group and then they disappear. It, it's in this cave off campus. I've been there. I know, I didn't see it, but I know it's the truth. You don't believe me, do you? - No, I do believe you. - You do? - Yeah. - How come? - I just do. - Will you help me get at the truth? I just need some evidence. I wanna go to the cave tonight to check it out, but I'm too scared to go alone. - I'll go with you. I know that cave. I'll make sure it all works out. - I can't believe it. Why would you believe me? - Well, I just have a feeling that's all. And, and you seem nice and smart. I'll be there if you want me to. - All right. I, I, I gotta go. I, I guess I'll see you there sometime after dark. - Okay. - [Walter] I gotta go. - Oh, he's gonna make a nice friend. - Donna, you know that poetry teacher doesn't mean anything to me. - It's not how you act in poetry class. - Well, it's 'cause I'm around all the brothers. You have to. - You don't have to. - I know what you mean, but it's a guy thing. Anyways, you're my girlfriend. - Okay, I'm sorry. Are we gonna study tonight? - Sure, we are. - What time? - I don't know, I'll call you. - Okay, but you better not forget like last time. - I won't. - All right. ♪ Do-be-do-be-do ♪ ♪ You look so beautiful ♪ ♪ To me ♪ - (laughs) You wish you were first, asshole. - Fuck you. Yeah, I, I wasn't about to run up to her like a little puppy dog. - Oh, you would have if you could have. 7:00 pm and I'm number one, baby. - Yeah, well, it's good she gets you out of the way first. I deserve to be savored like a fine wine. - Man, you guys make me wanna puke sometimes. - Hey, hey, I thought the agreement was I get some privacy. It's already 6:45. - Relax, guido, I'm outta here as soon as Danny girl gets out of the shower! - Hey, hold on a minute man, all right? I got a date with Shelly. I have the shower next. - Whoa, hey, my tutoring session starts at eight, I gotta be ready. - Shit, the amount of time you spend in that fucking bathroom getting ready, you should have started two hours ago. - When are you gonna start writing for Leno? You're so damn funny. - As long as you can get out of the shower by 7:30 it's fine, it's great. - It all depends on Danny. You know, it's his hair, you know, it takes time. Ouch. You know? - Yeah, well it's time for you girls to get outta here. Nora's gonna be here any minute and I wanna be alone. - Okay. - No problem. I don't wanna be the one accused of giving you performance anxiety. - Oh, yeah, might as well see if we can get Keanu outta the shower. - Hey, hey, I'll be sure not to tire her out for you. - Yeah, I hope that Viagra PowerBar does it's job. (chuckles) - [Nikko] Look, Nora. Shouldn't we go to the back? - Don't be stupid, Nikko. You wait here. I'm gonna go in. I'll come and get you in a minute. (knuckles tapping) - Okay, Nora. (Nikko sighs) - Damn, she's early. - Good evening, Jason. - Hi. You look great. - Thanks. Are we alone? - Oh, yeah, just you and me. - Excellent. Let's sit down on the couch. I wanna get started. - Great, I think I need some help with the, uh, love poems. - Oh, love, what a perfect place to start. - [Jason] Well, sounds good to me. - How long is it? - Well, uh, well, actually- - The love poem, how long is it? - Oh, uh, it's about 15 lines. - Well, you need to relax first. Give me your hands. Hmm. You're so strong. You're such a man. - Yeah, well I use 'em a lot. - [Nora] I'm sure you do. Take off that shirt, it's distracting me. - Are we even gonna read a poem first? - No, suge, we're gonna make the poetry. (phone ringing) - Oh, uh, sorry. I, I gotta. Hello? - Hi, Jake, what's up? - Me? Nothing. No, not, not, not a thing. - God, you sound weird. Are you feeling alright? - Uh, me? Yeah, yeah, fine, fine. Uh, never felt better. - What about our date? Are we still gonna study together tonight? - Oh, tonight? You know. - Jason, what's wrong? - Well, Donna, I'm totally sorry, but I, I just totally forgot. I, I have this thing with the brothers tonight for the new pledges. - But you told me tonight. - I, I know, it's just, I can't let the brothers down. Donna, don't start. - I'm used to this. I mean, it's always something. It's always the brothers or the poetry teacher. Or she's not there is she? - Who? - [Donna] Nora Crane. You know who. - [Jason] Me? Come on, you know me better than that. I love you, babe. - Yeah, well I hope so. That poetry teacher's bad news, Walter's been telling me. You better keep her out of your hair if you know what's good for you. - I will. Look, uh, the action's about to start here, I gotta run. - Well, call me when you're done. - Okay. (Donna giggles) - Remember what I told you? Poetry teacher evil. Bad. No good. - Okay, all right. Got it. - Bye. (phone clicks) - She's gonna kill me. - Not if I can help it. (Jason groaning) - No! Stop! No! (Jason groaning) (Jason groaning) - Brad, help me, she's killing me. - I'm just gonna leave you two alone. What the hell? (groaning) What is this? A crazy man on crack? - Nikko, take care of that one will you? (Brad groaning) (Brad groaning) (Jason groaning) (body thuds) (Jason groaning) (arm thuds) (arm thuds) Nikko, what are you doing? Stop it! - [Nikko] Nora, Nora, I have to tell you what happened. - I know what happened, you crushed his throat, you felt bad, you wanted to start talking to him. - No, no. This afternoon on campus that kid. - What kid? - The one I ran into at the cave. You said, "He's in your class." He seems smart and nice. - Walter! - Yeah, and nice. And well, he told me, "He figured it all out." He knows everything that you're doing. (hand slaps) Everything that we're doing. And well, he knows about the cave, and the guys, and everything. - Nikko, don't go panicking on me now. It's nothing. That kid's a little milquetoast prick. No one's gonna listen to his shit. - I don't know, he seems smart and nice. - Nikko, give it a rest. I know how this college frat boy world works. The Walter kid is nobody. If you and I stay focused, things will go smooth as usual. Don't go as spastic on me now. - Oh, okay. I'm sorry, Nora. - (sighs) Nikko, do your job and clean up in here. I've got three more appointments tonight. I need to stay on schedule, which means you need to stay on schedule. I've got a lot of work to do. Gotta get this room organized and, (knuckles tapping) shit! It's that jock. Nikko, clean up in here. I gonna go to the kitchen and take care of him. Hurry! (gentle sultry music) - Whoa, hey, you're already here. I thought we were gonna. - I'm sorry, Kevin. I was a little early. The door was open. I guess I just made myself at home. - Oh, hey, that's, that's totally cool. I'm just sorry I wasn't here. - Oh, please don't worry. I keep myself busy while I was waiting. I'm glad you're here now though. - Well, thanks. Me too. Uh, you know before we study and all that, you wanna eat? - I'd love to. - Oh, great, I was like totally starved on my way over here. Want some pizza? - Mm, yes, that'd be nice. - Oh, great. Um, you eat sausage? Um, I mean, uh, you want beef? I'm sorry, I, I mean, what would you like on your pizza? - Just you. - What? - Um, um, um, it's up to you. Excuse me, I need to fresh it up. - Oh, yeah, cool. Go right ahead. (liquid splashing) - Don't let me stop you. - Oh, yeah, right, sorry. - Noble spines of men support their angered souls. The shoulders heave with the cares of the old. Achilles's arms hold forth the rage leading to fingers smooth by lover's touch. - Oh, Nora. - Standing straight like Troy's sentinels harms the lover's ache. Lay down upon my sacred peer and rest that needful heart. - I think we should, you know, go out there. Oh, god. (plastic rattling) (Kevin grunts) - Close thine eyes, oh, noble warrior. You have toiled the day. - Oh, god. - You think only of love. You think of love, you dream of love. And you shall have it. (Kevin groaning) Fight not, young boy with what you desire more than all else. (Kevin groaning) Look at him, what a fucker. Shit. Just have to make time. (ominous music) There's so much better when they're quiet like this. (Kevin coughing) - Oh, Nora, you're so fucking hot. I didn't know what the fuck you were doing. This is hot. Oh, god, you are so beautiful. Oh, Nora. I'm yours baby. Do what you will, I can take it. - I know you can. - What are you doing with that? (Kevin grunts) - The spartan knew who was man and who was boy. The test of will proved the lie. The test is sharp, warm. Now. (Frank groaning) - Oh, that's kinky. That's kinky. (groaning) All right please. Okay, that's enough, please stop. Please stop, please. Well, this, this is too much that I can take. You're not like any of the Delta Gammas. - Fuck the Delta Gammas! (Kevin groaning) - Okay, oh. - Do the Delta Gammas know how to do this? - Oh, yeah. Oh, god. Oh, oh, Nora, this is so fucking hot. - The staff of life so bold, so strong remains the prize. We hold so long. - Oh, yeah. Oh, god. Oh, shit, you cut me. (groaning) - The stalk was hanging dizzying height. (Kevin groaning) To bring upon the many nights. (Kevin groaning) (Kevin screaming) (Kevin coughing) - I never did that before. Never did that before. That was really hot and everything, but please don't choke me this time. I don't want my girlfriend to notice any marks around my neck, you know? - Of course not. I won't choke you anymore. - Thanks. You're beautiful. (suspenseful music) (knife slashes) (Kevin screams) - A foe. - You bitch! (ominous music) - [Nora] What the fuck? - Nora, I, I just, I- - You just what? You're just wasting fucking time that's what! I'm in there working my ass off, and you're screwing around in here. - Nora, I'm sorry. I was just- - Nikko, forget the excuses! Stop wasting time! Make yourself useful!

The pretty, the supple, the smooth all come to knot the light of their own glory. - Oh, Nora, what are you doing? Stop, stop! Stop, don't!

(knuckles tapping) (door creaking) - Nikko, what the fuck are you doing? Stop it! You freak of nature. What the fuck did you kill her for? She was like innocent girl who didn't hurt anyone. And then you, I can't even talk about it. - She was making noise. I, I didn't know what to do. - I can't handle this. Shit, you fucked things up good. (door banging) Who the fuck is that? Let's go! (knuckles pounding) - Uh, maybe that Walter guy called the police. - Don't freak on me. (knuckles tapping) Answer the door and act like one of the frat guys. Give me some time. - Me? - Do it! Do it! (birds chirping) - Dude. - Hey, dude. - Where's the party? - Hey man, I don't know you. Is Danny around? - [Nikko] No. - What about Jason? - [Nikko] No. - How about Dave? - [Nikko] No. - What about Brad? - [Nikko] No. - How about. (Janet screaming) (suspenseful music) (Janet screaming) (Janet screaming) (bones cracking) (Janet screaming) (Janet screaming) (knife thuds) (Janet groaning) - It wasn't suppose to be like this. (Janet groaning) (ominous music) Fucking Nikko! Come on, let's go! You fucked this one up good! - Um, Nora, can I take a couple back friends? - At this point I don't give shit what you do. Let's get the fuck out of here! Come on! - [Justin] Yo, who let the fucking door open? - [Evan] Hey, yo, Brad, Kevin, where are you guys? - They probably decided to make it a threesome and took it to the cave. - Man, don't be sick. You're always talking about sex. - Hey, Jason, what the fuck man? - Come on, Jason, man, ha, ha, ha. What are you doing? Jason. - Man you're fucking lying, right? - Fuck, holy shit. No, man, he's fucking jacked. - Oh, shit. - Dude. - Dave O, Kevin, Brad! - Shh, dude, whoever did this might still be here, man. Shut up. - Oh, man, it's like Walter said, man. - No, no, no, she didn't do this, man. She couldn't have done this. - They're not fucking answering us. You, you don't think? - No, I don't think. Now come on, stop being such a fucking girl, all right? Look, dude, we gotta go check the other rooms. The other guys might still be here, all right? Come on. Go check 'em. Hey yo, Dave, you in there? - [Justin] Aw, Kevin man. - Holy shit. - That's fucking Kevin! - Oh, fuck, man, Walter was right, man. - Oh, shit, man, she fucking hunted them like animals. - Dude, she got 'em all. - Oh, fuck. - We didn't listen, man. We fucking didn't listen, dude. - Walter, he's going to the cave tonight, and that bitch will be there. - Fuck, you're right. - We gotta get the police. - No, no, no, no. We're gonna go there and do it ourselves, man. Screw the police, okay? - What you talking about? - Dude, first we're gonna save Walter's ass, then we're gonna toast hers. - Did you see how many fucking guys she- - Dude, there's one of her and two of us, man. What's your problem? - We're not fucking ninjas, man. - Dude, where's your fucking loyalty, all right? Would you be there if I was there, huh? Would you come save me? - Look at that fucking guy! - Would you come save me if it was me? Would you? - Yeah. - So come on, strap a set on and let's go. - Oh, shit. - Let's go. - I knew it. I knew it. I gotta call my dad. The police will believe me now, I have evidence. (phone ringing) (Stuart clears throat) - Hardwick Police. Stuart Merrick speaking. - Dad, there's been a bunch of murders. - Hey, is this Wally? - Don't call me Wally. It's Walter. - Listen, I'll call you whatever I damn please. - Look, Dad, there's been a bunch of murders. There's this psycho teacher on campus. - Yeah? - It's that new poetry teacher Nora Crane, she's evil. I know it. She has this poet society thing. She takes these guys to the cave and then they disappear. It's in this cave off campus. - Wait, wait. Did you see her do it? - No, I didn't see it, but Dad, it doesn't matter. I'm here at the frat house right now, and a bunch of the guys are dead. - I thought you said it was a cave or, or something. - It's in the cave and the frat house. - Wally, it's always the same with you. You're letting your imagination run over time. I think what you should do is spend some more time looking for girls. Perhaps get yourself a girlfriend, Incidentally that will eliminate your makeup crimes. - The bodies are right here. - Bullshit! I'm your father, buddy. And I know I don't want you to call your mother and worry her about this. Especially when you're under this condition. And besides I want you to get your ass over here this week, and clean that yard because it looks like bullshit. (phone thuds) (chuckles) Man, did I raised a weirdo. (Stuart grunts) Oh, man, I had it with him. (dial tone ringing) - Dad, Dad? Shit, he hung up! What am I gonna do? Donna, Donna, she'll help. (phone ringing) (water splashing) (sultry music) (answer machine beeps) - [Donna] Hi, this is Donna. Can't come to the phone right now. But if you leave your name and number, I will call you back. Love you. Bye. (answer machine beeps) - Donna. Donna, are you there? Pick up, pick up. Goddammit. Donna, this is Walter. Look, everything we suspected is true. That Nora bitch is a psycho. We have to stop her. Look, I'm at the frat house right now, and things are much worse than we expected. And my dad totally blew me off. I need your help. Look as soon as you get a chance, don't come to the Lambda Chi house. Uh, I've gotta go back to that cave or something. That gardener guy I met said, he'll be there, but I guess I'll be all right. Look, if you get a chance, meet me at the cave or something. Alright, thanks for listening, Donna. I gotta go. This is Walter. - Can't count as many times I've told you, but you never fucking listen. This is the result of you following your own selfish pleasures! We just got here, and we're gonna have to move on! I hope you're happy! - You mean leave, Nora? - We've killed as many as we can. We've gotta go on! - [Nikko] But we just got here. - [Nora] Sorry, see what your fuckups lead to? - [Nikko] But what about that Walter guy? He said, "He's gonna come and meet me." - Yeah, right! No one's here! No one's gonna show! I want you to stay put. Listen, I'm gonna go to campus, collect what cash we do have. I don't want any more problems from you, do you understand? Don't move from this cave! - But Nora, what if my friend Walter comes- - Stop it! You have no friends! They're all enemy. Listen, I don't have time for this. I want your ass right here when I get back. Don't screw up! - I won't, Nora. (suspenseful music) You came. I knew you'd come. - I was late. I had to get a flashlight. - I knew you'd come. You're gonna make a great friend. - Yeah, well, I've seen enough. I, I guess there's nothing here. I, I was all wrong. I should go. - No, no, no, you can't go. I mean, um, you have to stay. You have to help stop this. - I can't stop it. I mean stop what? - You figured it out. My sister, the poetry teacher. She's like mad all the time at all her students, all those guys thinking of, looking at, looking at her that way. It's, they're so dirty, and I have to help her. Please, I, I try to make friends, but they don't want to talk to me like you. You're different, I think. Please stay. Here, let me show you. - Let's go this way. - See, these are some of my old friends. They were real bad. They were thinking about dirty stuff all the time. They hurt my parents real bad. - [Walter] I gotta go. - No, no, no, you can't go. You're the first friend that talks to me. I want you to stay here, help, help me figure out what to do. Please, it's been such a long time since I had a friend, a talking one. Look my sister's gonna be back soon, what do I say? What do I do? - [Justin] Hey Walter, hold on. - [Evan] Is Nora with you? I'm gonna make that bitch pay. - It's more those bad guys. Call my sister a dirty name. - This way, I'm over here! (suspenseful music) - You're just like them. You don't wanna be my friend. My sister was right, you're all the same. All you think about is sex. All you think about is getting some. I'm gonna give you some. All of you. What you did to my parents. How could I even think that you wanna be my friend. I'm so stupid. No wonder Nora always yells at me. (Walter groaning) It's gonna be different this time. I'm gonna be in charge of these guys. I'll show 'em what I can do. (Walter groaning) I'm gonna show her exactly what I can do. - This is weird, man. I've never been here before. - Did you hear that? - What? - Sounded like some panting or something. Careful. Holy shit, man, it's that freshman. - Oh, god, man, it's Adam, and Josh, and Brad too. - [Evan] Oh, fuck, man, look, it's Walter, man. We're too late. - Oh, fuck. - Let's get outta here. - Oh, fuck. (suspenseful music) (Evan groaning) Fucking. Jesus, fuck! (Justin and Evan groaning) - Yeah, just like the rest, you're all gonna pay. Sister's gonna be real proud when she seen what I done. (Nikko grunts) (Justin coughing) - Fuck. (groaning) Evan, man, can you help me out here? - Coming man, hang on! (Justin groaning) (Nikko groaning) (Evan grunting) - Fucker, can you feel that, huh? (Nikko groaning) Evan, man, fucking help me here! - [Evan] Hang on, hang on. - Fucking guy's huge! (knife thudding) Jesus Christ. (head thuds) (Justin groan) (Evan groaning) (knife thuds) (fist thuds) (Evan groans) (body thuds) (fist thuds) (Nikko groans) (Justin grunting) - [Evan] Jesus, Justin, man. (knife thudding) Now you're gonna fucking die! (Justin grunting) - [Justin] Keep on doing it. - [Evan] What's this guy made of? (knife thuds) (Evan grunting) (knife thuds) Die! Hold on, man, hold on. - [Justin] What the fuck is this thing? (knife thuds) (Nikko groaning) (knife thuds) (knife thuds) (Evan grunts) Evan, man, can you get off me? I'm getting fucking crushed down here. - I'm sorry, dude. - Oh, god, fuck. (Justin groans) Motherfucker. - Dude. - Shit. - [Justin and Evan] We killed Fabio. - Man, you were fucking awesome, man. - Guy was a fucking yeti, man. Let's get the fuck out of here. - Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, wait. He said his sister was coming back, right? - Yeah. You're right. Uh, let's, let's hide in the corner. - No, no, no, better yet dude, we'll, we'll act like a couple of corpses, and when she comes in on my cue, we'll both attack her. Okay? - You're right. - Okay, come on. - Okay. - [Evan] You lie down on top of me, all right? - [Justin] Why do I have to be on top? - Dude, does it always have to be sexual with you? - [Justin] Oh, shit. - [Evan] Just shut up, all right? - Nikko, you little fuck, I told you not to move. Holy shit. Fucking Nikko! Goddammit! (Nora sighs) (Nora yells) Well, at least you accomplished something while I was gone. (hand thuds) (suspenseful music) (knife thuds) (Evan screaming) - What the fuck man? - Fucking little bitch! (knife thudding) (Justin screaming) (knife thudding) (Justin screaming) Goddammit! - Stupid little fucks- - Bitch! - You think I didn't notice you there? - Why did you fucking stab me, man? - You killed my brother! (Evan groaning) (Justin groaning) Vengeance is eternal. It builds the soul and molds the heart. Buy their time, 'til the day when all is theirs. Teach the wrongdoers of their evil ways. Die slow evil ones. Pay for the pain that you have caused. Pay for the pain in all men's hearts. Pay for the pain that's yours and yours alone. Those two were for you, Nikko. - Walter, Walter. Oh, my god. Walter. (ominous music) Oh, god, Adam. (Donna crying) No. Jimmy. (Donna crying) Oh, my god. (Donna crying) No. (Donna crying) Oh, my god. (suspenseful music) (Donna gurgling) (Donna coughing) (Donna groaning) - Shit. Donna. (body thuds) (ominous music) Fucking whore. Justice never flinches from the task. Although in battle we may lose our comrades. Our friends, our brothers fallen by the road. We must find comfort in justice of what is right. The evildoers who darken the night have been removed from the fray. Their evil hearts beat no more. For this we gladly pay. Rot in hell you unholy cunt. - Piece of trash! (Walter groaning) I'll tell you what's a piece of trash! Trash is all you fucking little frat boys with hard-ons! Killed my father! My mother! Now my poor pathetic brother Nikko! - Help! (groaning) - There's no help for you pervs! (Walter choking) (ominous music) (Nora sighs) (group vocalizing) (sighs) Calm wind blows across the plain. What is wrong has been made right. But we are not done with our noble quest. We must fight on to cleanse the rest. (group vocalizing) (water splashing) (group vocalizing) (group vocalizing) (group vocalizing) (group vocalizing) Good morning. My name is Ms. Nora Crane. I will be your instructor here for the remainder of the semester. I'm glad to join the faculty here. And I look forward to our time together this year. Poetry has been a chief love of mine for many years. The words, the rhythm, the energy can do amazing things. I hope to bring the joy of poetry into each of you. I want us to develop a relationship that is intimate and powerful. (heavy metal music)
