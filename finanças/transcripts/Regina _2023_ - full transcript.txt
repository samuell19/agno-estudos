A lion pillaged the jungle... ...and hoarded the loot in its den. Other animals in the forest were left deprived... ...and starving! Unable to bear their hunger, all the animals banded together... ...and set the lion's den on fire. A mighty lion, it may be... ...but when its abode burns, it has to leave the confines. Tie him up! Hold him right! We're actively working on your case, ma'am. If we find any clues, we'll definitely contact you. There is no use in you coming here every day. Please leave, ma'am. Please understand. If me sitting here is of no use... ...where else should I go? Whose help do I seek? What should I do? Do you have connections? Your situation is pitiful. In such a case... ...you can turn to the police. You can't entirely trust them, though. But you can trust me. If you want, I can take up your case. It'll cost a lot of money. Do you have it? It's okay even if you don't. I'll take the case up, in exchange for you. Your word is no good. Get your lawyer! Only then, can you leave. If you ran away, it'll be on me! The officer is very angry. You'll only aggravate him. - I've done what I can. - Sir, please... - We'll look into it and let you know. - Alright, sir. - You must come whenever we summon you. - Okay, sir. Sir... - Yes? - I need to meet the Sub-Inspector. Sit over there. They'll be here at six in the morning. Give them the rest of the details. - We'll need two photos of your husband. - Okay, sir. I'll get it. That man is always looking for trouble. - Sir? - Yes, Mr. Senior? What's your problem? Move aside! Why is he ignoring us? What do you want, ma'am? How many times do I tell you? The SI is busy with important business. Can't you understand? You have no patience! Always here to nag! Think it's all about you? Don't we have other work? What a torture! Go take a seat and let me do my job! Go! The crap I need to put up with! Standing there to irritate me! - Sir... I was told to give you this. - Hey! Must I tell you separately? Go sit down! I'm hounded 24/7 to file complaints for every missing little thing! We can only handle one case at a time. Hello, sir. Did you have a comfortable flight? Please come, sir. Had you called for me, I would've come over myself. - Why take the trouble? - No problem. - Please come in. - Greetings, sir. Order tea, Constable. Yes, sir. Please sit, sir. Don't worry about a thing. We'll take care of it. How can I ever forget what you've done for me? Stop! Did you think I've forgotten that you are a Naxalite? I thought you put all that behind you. But you're starting over again, eh? Why must I stop? None of the victims can ask for justice! Only those of us alive can do it! Whack him! Where I come from? A village atop a hill? There was no food. All of us were starving. But a man came over and fed us. His daughter Regina? She's a very good girl. She's like a daughter to me. I will do anything for her. How are you related to Regina? Why are you helping that woman? Her father and I... ...were comrades! We fought against this system together! Dad! Dad... Wanting to killing me... ...they accidentally got him instead. Her father was everything to her. As good as a comrade he was, he was just as good a father to her. I thought that was her end. I never saw her smile again. Then into her life... ...Joe came, like he was made just for her. After Joe entered her life... ...I saw joy on her face again. After so many years, she was happy again. "Like a storm in the sky, I soar..." "...the moment I think of you" "I am only a waxing crescent but when I see you..." "Like a storm in the sky, I soar..." "...the moment I think of you" "I am only a waxing crescent but when I see you..." "...I light up like the full moon" "Like a banyan's aerial root, I shall bestow an unswaying love" "I shall walk by your side until the end of time" "Like the gentle shower that drenches the soul..." "...I revel in the story of our love" "Like a storm in the sky, I soar..." "...the moment I think of you" "I am only a waxing crescent but when I see you..." "...I light up like the full moon" "Whenever I am dispirited..." "...you tend for me like a mother" "At the sound of your sweet moans..." "...my heart seems to float away" "On the bed of your tresses..." "When I recline in a stupor..." "In the long stretch of tender memories..." "...why does my heart spread its wings?" "Like a storm in the sky, I soar..." "...the moment I think of you" "In every fibre of my being..." "...your beautiful face is etched" "My life line..." "...why do you tug at, so fervently?" "Like a million shining lights..." "...when you appear bright..." "My fortunate shadow..." "...emerges dancing in ecstasy" "Like a storm in the sky, I soar..." "...the moment I think of you" "I am only a waxing crescent but when I see you..." "...I light up like the full moon" "Like a banyan's aerial root, I shall bestow an unswaying love" "I shall walk by your side until the end of time" "Like the gentle shower that drenches the soul..." "...I revel in the story of our love" Good morning, sir. I've checked all their documents. - All clear. - Give me that. I'll send the statement and cheque book. - Send it by post. - Okay, sir. I'll send it. - Morning, sir. - What's up, Joe? - The file you sent... - Sign off on Manoj's documents and send it. - I already have. - He's bombarding me with calls over it. - I'll take care of it. - Make it quick. What is this, sir? Everybody stay calm! Nobody scream! - Look at that! - Where's the phone? What do we do now? Anyone who makes a sound gets shot! Go! Push everyone that way! Everyone sit in the corner! Stay calm! No screaming! Scream and you'll die! Hey you! Be quiet or I'll shoot you! - Empty that box! - Shut up! Empty every box! Spare nothing! Take that, too! Make a sound... The cops will come! Hey! Why are you hitting him? No need for that, Ravi! Listen to me! Let's go! Let's go! Please call an ambulance! What happened? Keep moving! Let's go! Get in! Start driving! Hurry! Start the car! Quick! Drive! Go! - Drive faster, damn it! - Go! Go! - He's right behind us! - It was only meant to be a robbery! - Go to the side! - Take the left! He's gaining on us! What a needless mess you made! Keep going! Don't stop! Drive faster! Careful! Drive faster! Go that way! Go left! Go right! Get out, guys! Get out and run! Hurry. Everything changed that day. I knew what she was about to see. But I did not know how she was going to bear it. Joe? Joe! Joe! What happened? What... 'A month has passed since the UNG Bank robbery...' '...but the police are yet to apprehend the three other perpetrators.' 'Only the driver was caught and imprisoned.' 'The public attribute it to the indifference of the police.' Regina... The investigation is ongoing. We'll be right by your side. I don't know what else to say. No matter what problems I have... ...one look at you... ...and I forget all about them. Constable, find that FIR on Siva. He's giving trouble. Let's wrap it up. - Move aside! - Sir? - Why are you getting up? Sit down. - Okay, sir. Ma'am! Where are you going? Stop! I caught the driver. Don't I know to catch the thieves? Get going. Wasn't it the public that nabbed the driver, sir? Constable! Make her leave! Get out! Please go. Please leave, ma'am. Go! With no one to help her get justice... ...what else could that poor girl do? 'The couple should go somewhere, take a trip...' '...be happy, and then try during the fertile period.' 'Having a child is a blessing.' 'The two of you will be blessed soon.' 'Don't worry.' Regina? Don't worry. Everything will be alright. Take care. She is so stressed, sir. She has asthma, too. And I'm sorry to say this. She's had a miscarriage. If you want, you can see her now. How shall I face her? Regina? Do not lose courage, dear. She was haunted by those masked faces that had ruined her life. At times, I heard her cries of agony. She always stayed shut inside the house. She never stepped out. Suddenly, one day... ...she left. But she decided. She will hunt them down! Give me that! How many times have I told you not to use the phone? No, aunty... My mother promises to tell me a story every night, but never does. She doesn't love me. Oh no... I'll tell you, baby. Once upon a time, there was a cute child. She kept asking her mother to tell her stories. The mother had to work very hard for the child's sake. Because of that, she was very busy. She was sad that she couldn't spend time with the cute child. One fine day... ...another lady arrived. She told the child stories every day. The child became very happy. Happy? Yes, I'm happy. What happened to your husband? He got into needless trouble and landed in jail. Shall I tell you something no woman tells another? You are very pretty. Then you should be called drop dead gorgeous. I really like spending time with you. The most valuable thing in this world... ...is to have someone to listen. "Are we fish bobbing in the brook?" "Crossing past the claws of the waves..." "...we swim against the current" "We bear the pain to move forward" "It is a world that breeds battles" "It lays traps wherever we go" "Who shall be victorious?" "In this war of a fish that strives to slash its net with a sword" "Hope will pave the path to tomorrow" "A warm hand on the shoulder will urge us on" "The angry wounds will heal" "You reap the pearl only when you dive deep" Why are you always sad? Whatever it is, you can tell me. Every tide that comes in frightens me. These tides... I don't know when they will stop. The strength of a tide varies from place to place. Life is all about swimming against such tides. If you don't... ...like rocks at the sea's edge... ...the waves will beat down on you. The nature of its power, determines the face of the rocks. Ever since I was born... ...I've been taking a beating, just like these rocks. As long as we're around, they shall keep beating down on us. To escape his debt... ...my father got me married to that man. Since then, I've turned into a stone. "A relentless search on the shore..." "...will yield a mound of shells" "The stars float high above the waters" "There exists no path to bridge them" "Why the sorrow, when darkness falls?" "See the stars dancing in the ripples" "When you swim in the waters..." "...paths lead out on all sides" "When you meet with the dark..." "...quicken your pace, and you will find the light" "See the stars dancing in the ripples" "It is a world that breeds battles" "It lays traps wherever we go" "Who shall be victorious?" "In this war of a fish that strives to slash its net with a sword" "Hope will pave the path to tomorrow" "A warm hand on the shoulder will urge us on" "The angry wounds will heal" "You reap the pearl only when you dive deep" Do you like it, guys? He's started! Who do you think you're hitting? Whack him! Who are you messing with? Right. I'll call you back. How dare he, man? Stop it, man! Please, guys! Stop! He hit one of our guys! Move aside! - Let's go. - Come on. - Come on! - Just leave, man! I can't bear it here anymore! Daddy! Darling! Don't leave me and go away, dad. I will never leave you, dear. What's wrong with you? Why do you lie there lifeless? Why are you crying now? What's wrong? I was in the mood, but you pissed me off! Have you gone crazy or you don't feel it anymore? Or have you grown tired of me? Things are not right between us. I don't just want sex. I want affection! I want love! I want concern! Do you know how much I yearn for your care? But this is all you want from me! As far as you're concerned, I'm just a sex machine, right? Wow! You really mean that? Have I done nothing for you? Am I living only for myself? Whom am I earning all this for? I know! But... 'But?' But what? Who's there? Who's there? Come out! Get inside! What is happening? Come out! - Whack him! - Whack him hard! - Where is Sanny? - In the room upstairs! Stop What? Are you angry? Why? I've come after so long. Why are you ignoring me? I'm trying to be patient... Let go of me! I've had enough. You have it good. You come once in a blue moon... ...cause trouble... ...and go missing for months! I've had enough. Just leave me! I try to be reasonable but you're pushing it! I have nothing more to say to you! Talking nonsense! It's okay. Don't cry. You deserve a beautiful life, Julie. I'm not that lucky. Don't talk like that. You're a sensitive person, Julie. You don't deserve this kind of treatment. He doesn't deserve you! Do you need a man who stomps on your self-respect? Sanny is growing up fast, Julie. Must she grow up watching her father treat her mother like crap? Where can I go? You tell me. What can I do? I have no one! I have nothing! I just want to die. How can you say such things when I'm around? Relax! "The fire smoulders" "It destroys a beehive" "Deep in the human heart..." "...vengeance takes root" "A sword unsheathed..." "...to torment the heart of the wicked" "Stand up boldly" "Make them wail" "A plunge in the ocean, a dive into its deep..." "...reach its bottomless abyss to resurface" "You have the flair and mettle for it" "Go" "Spare no kindness to those who plucked the life of your beloved" "Show them that the price of loss is sorrow" "Go" "The fire smoulders" "It destroys a beehive" "Deep in the human heart..." "...vengeance takes root" - They came looking for you, Mari. How is the place? Do you like it? After a long time, I feel at peace. Can you come downstairs? I have a surprise for you. Shall I tell you a story? For a long time, a fish was swimming aimlessly. It found a place of refuge and went in. Only after going in, did it realize... ...it was a trap. The trapped fish did not know... ...there was only one way out of the trap. If it wanted to get out... ...only the trapper can make that happen. The fish... Am I the fish? Looking for Julie, huh? Would you like to have something? Something hot? Something chill? You don't know where Julie is? Remember the bank robbery? Who are you? Relax! Relax! Your family is under my control. Do you know who you're messing with? Indeed, I do. Should something happen to me... If the cops get me... ...you'll never see your wife and daughter again. The story diverges here. Your family is safe, under the care of angels. If anything goes awry... ...angels will become demons. Try whatever you want... What happens next... ...only I know. In 'The Lion and the Hare'... ...the hare always follows the lion's orders. But here... ...when the hare gives an order, the lion must follow it. It must follow. - Tell me. - Buddy... 'I don't know if you understood it or not. I'll repeat.' Only you can get me out of this. 'The smallest clue will suffice.' - Just wait. - Okay. 'Don't rush.' Please find Julie and Sanny, wherever they are. Don't worry. Go with her. I'll handle it. "What brings this angel into the forest?" "What is she here for? What is it all about?" "Under the guise of love..." "...these innocent souls, amongst a legion of demons" "The life you lead is a lie, O dear" "Should you worry about living in this world of illusion?" "Truth will last forever" "Lies and falsehood will soon perish" "What brings this angel into the forest?" "What is she here for? What is it all about?" 'When Dad came back after so long, I was happy to play with him.' 'It was a lot of fun to play with him on the beach!' 'Dad said he'd always be with me.' 'Where did he go now, mom?' 'I am afraid here!' 'When will we go home, mom?' 'Will Dad come and take us back?' I was just their getaway driver. I swear I didn't know anything. I did it for the money. I have nothing to do with what happened there. After seven long years, we were blessed. Nothing left from that either! I was just an ordinary girl. He changed the way I perceived life. Everything I had... ...was destroyed in a single day. I repeat. It's not as easy as you think. What do I have to lose? I have nothing to live for! My entire world has been destroyed! They're all I have right now! Two weeks ago, some cash was deposited into a bank account. Which bank? Which area? ABI Bank in Vinayaga Road. To whose account was the deposit made? I don't know that, sir. Any issues, sir? No. Just an enquiry, that's all. Oh... Okay. - Please check. I sent you a mail. - I'll check it out. - Yeah. Received. - Okay. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. - Hello? - Hello, sir? I've sent you an address. The name is Mari. - Find this person immediately. - Okay. If you get any details, call me immediately. - It's very urgent. - I'll check right away and update you, sir. Fine. Stop smoking! Dhee... Dheena is very dangerous! Before you can say 'Hi', he'll read your eyes and kill you. A real lunatic! And if I die? What happens to your family? He's always flanked by henchmen. Even if you kill him, you can't escape the place. You are the one who must worry about that. If there's even the smallest screw up, it's me he'll come after. What if something goes wrong? That's another story. We'll see. Hello? Hello? I've almost figured out where your wife and daughter are. 'She can't hold it over you for much longer.' 'Until then, just manage.' I'll update you in 30 minutes. - After that, finish her. - Just find them! - I'll take care of her. - I got this! Hello? Who's in there? Who are you looking for? Isn't this Mari's house? Mari used to live here, but vacated the house and moved out. - Do you know where she went? - No, sir. Pick up! Pick up! Put it on speaker. Hello? I'm sorry. I guessed wrong. Don't react to anything she says. There's no other go. Stay calm. Understood? Tell me if you understand. Hello? Keep trying. Shall we go now? "She is roaming in my heart" "I became the king" "She is inciting me" "She caresses and tortures me" Hey! Turn it down! - Brother, please... - Sit down! Let me go, brother. - I didn't mean to do it! - Hey... Please, brother... - I didn't mean to do it. - Sit down! I won't do it again, brother! Spare me! Please, brother! - Sit down! - Please spare me! - Hey... - Yes, brother? Despite knowing he worked for me, why then did you touch him? Brother... - I didn't mean to! - Alright. - Left or right? - Left, brother! Left, huh? Please don't, brother! Sit down! - I didn't mean to, brother! - Left, yes? Yes, brother! - Sure it's the left? No retakes! - Go ahead! Please spare me! I didn't mean to do it! You deserve more than a single chop. You dare lay your hand on my guy? - I won't do it again, brother! - Here! Brother! No need for a hammer. - Smashing the hand won't do the trick. - Right! Must be a one hack deal! - Must not splatter blood! Back it up! - I got it! No. I'll do it steady and slow! Be calm, sit quietly! "We're a rugged lot" "We laugh our hearts out" "We impose our will and strut our stuff" "We're a rugged lot" "We laugh our hearts out" "We impose our will and strut our stuff" "This is a gang of swag" "Full of splendor" "Flap your gums and you won't feel your limbs" "We booze all night and knock ourselves out" "We plan all day long before picking up our weapons" "We are the eternal alpha dogs" "Not a damn trick of yours will fly with us" "We are the eternal alpha dogs" "Not a damn trick of yours will fly with us" "Mess with us and you're gone" "Our aim never misses" "You're screwed, shithead" "Your power's no good here" "Mess with us and you're gone" "Our aim never misses" "You're screwed, shithead" "Your power's no good here" "Crank up the voltage and let's rock this joint" "Let's make merry like there's no tomorrow" "Say one wrong word and it's bye bye to your lips" "Try coming near us and you'll still be out of reach" He's one of us! What's up, man? Brother! - What's with the kisses? - How are you? What? Overjoyed seeing me after three years? Who's this, buddy? Your new chick, huh? Super, buddy! Come on! "Our aim never misses" Does your wife know about this? "Your power's no good here" "Mess with us and you're gone" "Our aim never misses" "You're screwed, shithead" "Your power's no good here" "Crank up the voltage and let's rock this joint" "Let's make merry like there's no tomorrow" "Say one wrong word and it's bye bye to your lips" "Try coming near us and you'll still be out of reach" "This is a gang of swag" "This is a gang of swag" "This is a gang of swag" "Full of splendor" "Flap your gums and you won't feel your limbs" "This is a gang of swag" "Full of splendor" "Flap your gums and you won't feel your limbs" You're just out of prison. You must be beat. Let's have a beer and chat. It'll cool things down. Sure, brother. - Hey! - Yes, brother? - Having one when no one's looking? - No, No! Get going! Is there any left? Yes, brother! Have you been in touch with anyone since the job? Tell me, man! No. When were you released? Just a few days ago. I was the only one busted. - You've changed the set-up! - Sit down! Sit down, dear. Everything got screwed up. Didn't we do it all for the money, Brother Dheena? All is lost! My family, my business... All is lost! The plan Ravi and I hatched involved only the robbery. It was Ravi who... Before we could round up the money, he sought out a guy... ...and smashed him to smithereens with a rod! Sorry, ma'am. Don't mistake me. He left him a mangled mess! A murder plan? Ravi's personal murder plan. Where is Ravi now? I'll tell you. Hold this. Care for a beer, ma'am? Here you go. Take it. Just a small sip, ma'am. No wonder you're beautiful. - Cheers, buddy. - Cheers, brother. He went underground for a year. He's gotten himself a farm... ...and is practically untouchable. He deceived us and his plan paid him big. After you went to jail... ...we carried out some high profile jobs. Major league stuff! That's what landed us in trouble. After that, all we do is... Just hacking. But I have to say... ...carrying out such jobs has its own thrill! The smell does a real number on me! Which is it? Italian or German? Original, huh? Going to kill me? Brother... No, brother... Super! Can you shoot well? You've decided to bump me off. Okay then! Come! Going to shoot? Don't know to hold a gun? Why look at him? Tell me, man! Come closer and shoot! Look behind you. - Sounded like gunshots! - Come on! No! Regina! Regina! Regina! - Regina! - Check on the boss! Regina! Get inside, guys! Regina! Get me that shirt. That one, too. 750 rupees, sir. - Take the right measurements. - Sir... - Record the exact time. - Alright, sir. Cross-check this. 'What?' 'She killed Dheena?' 'Listen to me.' I don't know what to do! 'She's carrying out her plan with a clear head.' 'As long as you can, delay the next phase of her plan.' 'Only then, we can find your wife and daughter.' Looks like if you don't find them, I'm on the way to be imprisoned for life! 'Do something quick!' The lion might be a prisoner now. 'But a lion is always a lion.' Wait for the right time. - I seek your help and you give me this crap! - Just wait! Do something! Check nearby hospitals for anyone who fits the description. We have CCTV footage, sir. Take a look, sir! Track that number plate. Auto! - Zoom! - Okay. The car's moving on the West Fort side. We've got more CCTV footage tracking the car, sir. Take a look at this, sir. The woman seems not injured. And that car is over there, too. About 40 kilometres from the crime scene. Alert the area check post! Okay, sir. We seem to have a hit a wall, sir. They're not moving beyond the West Fort side. They seem to have switched cars. - Rajesh? - Yes, brother? They've killed Dheena. If you want to stop their hunt, you must kill Ravi. - Then, follow my instructions. - Okay, brother. Don't look at anyone. Just follow my lead. Sir! - Okay, sir! - Hey! Speak, I say! Will you speak or not? You won't ever spill, right? You might need the treatment then! No matter how many times I ask, you dare stay mum? You only have a day's time... ...to save his family. Tell them not to do anything to her, sir! If they do, she'll kill my wife and child! She has abducted them! She's very dangerous! Please save my family! Sit quietly! - Talk to him. - Please, sir! He knows everything. She's a psycho, sir! Questioning me is a waste of time. Sir. I've collected all details about the woman. This is an old case, sir. Going by what you said... ...here's what I think. It seems to be a long planned deed. We're on our way! Never mind what he knows. What's your demand? I want Rajesh! 'Rajesh'? He's a local ruffian, sir. He's usually into petty stuff like pick pocketing. Bank robbery is way out of his league. He was there, sir. Yes, sir! Where is he? No one knows. Pull up all his case files! Case number 345, sir! - Sorry? - 345, sir. Rajesh. Is it him, sir? It's him, sir! - Sir... - Hey... I've committed a murder, sir. I'm afraid, sir. Please arrest me and throw me in jail, sir! - Please arrest me! I'll go in there myself! - Hey! - Please, sir! - Rajesh? Hey...buddy... Just a minute. - Deepak! - Sir... I'm Rajesh, sir. I didn't do anything, sir! Please help me! What am I to do if someone else smashed this lady's husband to death? Please help me, sir! Help me, sir! Sir! - Sir? - What is it, man? - Shall we proceed? - Yes, sir. When will I get paid? You'll have it once the job is complete. - Really? - I'll handle the rest. Okay, sir. Thank you. Hey... Get up. Get up. Hold it, sir. - I know her. I'll just see her for a bit. - You can't go in. She's a friend, sir. - Please listen! - Let me just see her. - She's hurt badly. - We have our orders! This is way beyond your authority, sir! We're with you, Regina! Did you think she has no one? - What can you do, sir? - Get him away from here! Will you kill me? Will you? - Let go of me! - Leave, sir! - No visitors! - The poor orphaned girl is hurt so badly! What, Regina? Are you well? If you had heard me out the other day... ...this wouldn't have happened to you, right? A young woman. Once you're indicted, we'll give you the royal treatment. Well... I can't see you anymore, can I? What say? Shall we see? Get the report. Check on that! Go on! The police got us, buddy! What are you saying? Someone named Mari will call you. Mari. It's all her plan. I'll handle it. Hello? This is Mari. - Go on. - Did your friend tell you? There is a plan. If you want Julie and Sanny to stay alive, you must execute it. When Jerry is alone at the hospital... ...out of the blue, Tom showed up! Tom shot at Jerry! A frightened Jerry ran away from the place to save himself. This entire thing was planned by Tom and Jerry! "A million foes may attack, but an unfazed tigress, you are" "Run and hide, you may, but strike them down with great vengeance" "For it is time for you to transform into the Lady of Justice" "Is tonight the night your unbridled rage unites with your unyielding courage?"

Because this isn't just your voice. - Does a lady named Regina stay here? - What's wrong? - Does she stay here? - I don't know. I asked you a question! Answer me! It's the truth! I don't know! - We don't know where she is! - You better come clean! Is she here or not? I'll throw you all in jail! - Don't hurt him, sir. - Tell me! - We don't know, sir. - She was here. Where's Regina, old man? I swear we don't know where she is! Don't hit my father, sir! - Why hit an old man? - Speak, I say! She stayed here for seven years. She left after her husband died. We haven't seen her since!

"Step up and render to dust, the treachery of these wolves" "A million foes may attack, but an unfazed tigress, you are" When I moved up to Joe's position, I found the file. I learnt some shocking things. Joe's death was pre-mediated murder. They had dispersed many high value loans without any proper documentation. I asked the manager about it. Listen up! Aren't you getting your salary on time? Take what's paid and go tend to your family! Say one word beyond that... ...I'll kill you! Get lost! When I thought about it, I remembered something else. The day Joe was killed... ...it seemed like the manager pointed out Joe, to the robbers. He and MLA Ranganathan are in some way involved in Joe's murder. You say you know him well. Just buy him off and shut him down. I know him well, indeed. But he won't budge for anything! He knows everything! Not just the JK Garden documents. Those 80 acres! He also has the fake document we prepared for the agricultural land! Listen up. I have a plan. But the execution... Leave it to me. I'll handle it. This is how it should be spun. 'Four masked robbers...' 'During their escape after robbing money and jewels at UNG Bank...' '...they were accosted by bank teller Joe, who tried to stop them.' 'He was brutally assaulted and died at the scene.' How about that? You can do nothing to me! 'Before dawn, unidentified assailants brutally murdered MLA Ranganathan.' 'With the name 'Regina' scratched on his forehead, he was tied in a sack...' '...and tossed near the new bus terminus.' 'Police are investigating if this murder was an act of revenge.' Move! Hi, sir. This is wrong. You keep committing crimes, Regina. 'Regina', huh? Give me that. Give me the gun! Here's the thing, sir. Check this out. I've got this nice coat on. Sunglasses, too. I'm a VIP now too, right? Okay. What do you want? Respect. Will I get it, sir? Will I get it? - Hey! - Will I get it? "Did you think I had fallen?"
