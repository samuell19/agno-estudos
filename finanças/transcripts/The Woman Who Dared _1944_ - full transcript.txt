No, my daughter, you shall not go dancing No, my daughter you shall not go dancing PLAY AREA FOR THE VILLENEUVE ORPHANAGE PIERRE GAUTHIER MECHANIC... Can you give me a hand? - Sure, boss. Be right there. It's okay Iike that? - Sure, it's fine. The piano won't fIy away. Almost done. - Moving is a tough job. Don't hold it against me. It's my first in 10 years. Ready? Dad. - What? Take the piIIows. - Put them in the car. Ready? Off you go. CarefuI with my piano. Don't go too fast. - No danger of that. Stop. Keep going. What about the kitchen stuff? My pots, my potato masher? How do you expect me to cook? That's no way to move. You think you know everything. One thing at a time. Put that down. I'II do it. I'm worried about my piano. - He won't pIay it. Help your mother. - The kitchen shouId be moved first. Then the bedroom. You start with your tooIs. Grease everywhere. Let me do that. Your rheumatism wiII act up. It aIready has. - Here's your chair. Take a rest. I'd rest if we weren't moving. - It's been expropriated. You Iet them. - They need it to buiId an airfieId. In my time, we did fine without them. In your time, what happened to mothers-in-Iaw who did nothing but nag? Pierre. - Therese. Got your hands fuII. I'm gIad we're aImost done. - Give me that. I'II put them in here. I'II be gIad to be gone. It's giving me the blues. And you? No. - Leaving our home doesn't bother you? No, because in the new garage, you'II be there, and the kids. And your mother, and her rheumatism. And our furniture, our mementos, everything. Look at it that way. You're right, but stiII, Ieaving this pIace - Drive this Ioad over and come back. Get in the car, mother-in-Iaw. HoId on. I saved you the best spot. Snug as a bug. Need a hand? - Why do you have to move? Because it's been expropriated to buiId an airfieId. Open your ears. Here are your pans. Don't break anything. Are you comfortabIe? Up front with your mother and the bIankets. Everybody in? What? - My rheumatism. I can hardIy taIk. UnfortunateIy, that'II never happen. Here, take the crate. Off you go. Ready? My eighth trip and I haven't broken anything yet. Let me carry something eIse. - No, you're aII sweaty. We'II check the garage for Ieft-behind wire, boIts, screws. Stuff your grandma says is useIess, but one day, it'II come in handy. Out of the way. UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT What are you doing? There's a probIem with your piano. - Was it damaged? The staircase is too narrow. We'II use the window. Can you manage? - Sure, with these two heIping me. Have you moved pianos this way before? Don't worry. It'II be up there in no time. More stuff to move. It doesn't matter. Robert wiII get it. I guess that's it. - Can we go now? Sure. In a week they'II tear it down with picks and shoveIs. Our home. The house where you were born. We aImost forgot the measuring stick. How couId I forget that? I invented it. A bIue penciI for the boys, a red one for the girIs. Every birthday, we measured you on this waII. Four years oId, seven, eight - The first time, you were this big. - I've grown. Your sister was sick that year. She onIy grew an inch. She's caught up since. Two turns of the screw and it's off. It's a shame to destroy aII that. DemoIition crews need to make a Iiving too. A fine euIogy. There's your mother. Let's go. How's it going on your end? Their system for Iifting the piano is terrifying. Higher. Put your backs into it. Heave ho. Easy, Granny. It's heavier than it Iooks. They're going to drop it. - You caII yourseIves men? On my command, everybody puII. It's too heavy. One, two - Heave ho. Once more. Heave ho. They broke my piano. - I can see that. If they were reaI men - - Out of my sight. The kids too. Take your stooI. Have Iunch somewhere. You guys are fired. No one touches the piano. I'II see if something can be saIvaged. Want some cheese? - I'm fuII. You're tired. I saved this for you. What's wrong, honey? It's just... ...we moved without counting the costs. You needed more space to work. I've got space and tooIs. Now I just need customers. Maybe I'm not good enough. - You're as good as anyone. Better. You're just saying that. - No, I know you. I wondered if we'd overreached ourseIves too. Then I thought it over. We'II have to work even harder. But that's fine. It's for the kids. If we get some customers. Don't be siIIy. We've just arrived and you're aIready worried. What if - It's the night beII. What if it's a customer? What a mess. What wiII they think? Hurry up. The cIient might Ieave. What's the probIem? - A stupid accident. I need to be in Limoges tomorrow and I broke a spring. It's not the best time. I spent aII day moving. It'II take aII night to repair this. I'm sorry to insist, but I have an important business meeting tomorrow. I understand, but - Drive it into the garage. I'II see what I can do. Is it ready? - I finished at dawn. I must be dreaming. Your garage was a mess Iast night. You put everything away too? - My wife did, to keep me company. She deserves to rest. - What about the kids? They can't go to schooI hungry. Don't eat Iike such a pig. Aren't you eating? - I'm not hungry. Didn't you sIeep? Your eyes are red. - It's just the dust. If business goes weII, Dad wiII buy you another piano. ReaIIy? - Yes. Open the door. It's aII for Dad? - And the other gentIeman. Thanks a miIIion. - Just doing my job. And damn weII. I own a big garage in Limoges. I've got a guy running it because I'm doing bigger deaIs, but he'd never puII an aII-nighter for me. Coffee? I'd Iove some. Thanks. I need peopIe Iike you to run my garage. I'm not joking. If you don't mind moving. Again? - We just got here. I traveI a Iot. I speciaIize in eIectricaI equipment. I'm doing the airfieId's instaIIations. I aIso seII neon signs. Want one? Perhaps when business is booming. - Thanks, madame. I can see you're tired. - A bit. It just hit us. I'm often in the area, so I'II drop by again. We can discuss my garage, if you Iike, or a neon sign, when business picks up. It's reaIIy bright. - Isn't it professionaI, Mom? Who'II have the Iast Iaugh? The eIectric company. CIaude. Stop spinning Iike a top. WiII this Iesson ever end? He's in no hurry to see us. Mother-in-Iaw, pIease. Good. Very good. But your attack stiII Iacks precision. Take it from the Iast Iine. I think they're here, sir. The whoIe famiIy? - It's a big expense, so we'II aII decide. In a minute. Start there and watch the tempo. One, two, three -... JacqueIine prefers this one. - ImpossibIe. A bIack piano wiII cIash with our pine furniture. This one. It has candIehoIders. - JacqueIine prefers the bIack one. I can repaint it. - Don't start putting coIors everywhere. FinaIIy. The Iesson's over. - Listen, Mother-in-Iaw - Let's not argue here. - I'II keep quiet. My rheumatism is back. Forgive us, a difficuIt passage needed to be worked out. Are you pIeased with her? She'd bIush if I toId you what I think. Have you chosen a piano? We're hesitating. - Not me. BIack is depressing and cIashes with our decor. It shows fingerprints and scratches. Like I said, I'II keep quiet. I propose a smaII test. Sit here. Listen, pIease. PIay an E-major chord. Now Iisten to this one. Hear the difference in tone? We'II try something eIse. An arpeggio in G. Good. And this one. Is it cIear now? We can't buy a piano based on an arpeggio. Is there a song that JacqueIine and I couId pIay... ...to heIp you decide? 'The TriumphaI March' from Aida. With pIeasure, madame, but Iater. AIthough it's usuaIIy pIayed by trumpets. Mrs. Gauthier, what's your favorite song? The one Pierre often sang during our courtship. 'The Time of LiIacs and Roses.' Yes, I know that one. PIease begin, JacqueIine. I'II join in. CITY OF VILLENEUVE JUNE 24, 2:00 P. M. AIRFIELD GRAND OPENING STUNT FLYING BY MISS IVRY PRECEDED BY ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE BANQUET One more photo, Vice President? As many as you Iike. - Where's the president? Mr. President. No time for photos. I need to oversee the finaI touches. HoId that pose. Thanks. SpIendid. The pies have arrived. Serve them after the cake. Yes, sir. Not coId enough. Serve the Saint-Martin with the appetizers, the Mount-Louis with the timbaIe. Announce the vintages too. The tabIe Iooks fine. Who seated Mrs. Michaud by the pharmacist? How tactIess. Mrs. Michaud. Next to the hatter. Perfect. WeIcome home. - It Iooks so different. Thanks for coming. No hard feeIings? FIowers? - Right here, sir. Remind the waiters to wear white gIoves and not to serve the Vouvray untiI dessert. When we Iived here, we didn't make such a fuss. A gIass of port? - Thanks. HeIIo, MarceI. - You remember me? The piano sure does. - Think their airfieId wiII work? Do you want to fIy? - No. I considered taking over their bar. Aviation is the future. But it takes faith. Have you got that? FrankIy, airpIanes scare me. I'm just interested in the bar. Excuse me. Port? Vermouth? Vermouth. Thanks. HeIIo, Gauthier. - HeIIo, Mr. NobIet. My respects, madame. StiII going strong? And you, stiII in fine spirits? - On the contrary, I'm furious. My manager in Limoges has reaIIy gone too far. You'II never guess what he did. Even if I Iaugh, it's quite serious. The banquet awaits, miss. - With pIeasure. My mechanic isn't here and I'm having engine troubIe. Is there anyone who couId Iook at it? - Damnation. HoId on. I've just the man. But he's a guest. - It shouIdn't take Iong. Okay. Vice President. - Yes? WouId you get Gauthier, pIease? Right away. If he cheats me on tires, gas and oiI, he'II cheat me on everything. Keep an eye on him. - I need honest foIks Iike you to run it. The president wants to see you. - Me? Excuse me. What sort of man is the president? - Dr. MauIette? He's Iost interest in medicine. - He's crazy about popuIar aviation. It's his Iatest passion. Before that, it was vitamins. Before that, it was making Touraine wines into champagne. Before that, I can't remember. He's introducing Pierre to the aviatrix. He's busy, so I'II make you an offer you can't refuse. They're Ieaving together. - This is important. You're not Iistening. Yes, I'm Iistening. It doesn't seem serious. - Too bad. I Iike compIicated repairs. Even at Iunchtime? - If it's to heIp you. What a beauty. Gorgeous. How far on a tank? - 930 miIes. That's progress. You worked in aviation? - Yes, in WWI. On the front Iines? - Yes. Turn it on. Don't you want me to expIain? - No need. A mechanic's ears teII him exactIy what's wrong. I've got it. I Iearned a Iot up north. He'd bring back pIanes riddIed with hoIes. Even if the engine had been hit, I'd just Iisten and find the probIem. Who was he? - Guynemer. You knew him? - Sure. I don't mention it often, onIy when it comes up. Was he truIy exceptionaI? - Yes. A great man. Miss lvry, we're waiting. - Coming. I'd better join the banquet, though I'm not Iooking forward to it. Enjoy your meaI. - Thanks. WeIcome, friends. WiII our mechanic work a miracIe? - CertainIy. He's got many taIents. He's the best at what he does. He couId even show a cIockmaker a few tricks. PIus, he's modest. Whenever you praise him, he protests. He's protesting quite IoudIy. Mind if I wash my hands? - No probIem. Hope some food's Ieft. What's happening now? - The president's speech. Enjoy it, it might be aII you get from the banquet. We might be a smaII town, but we're proud to support a great idea. For we Iack neither energy nor courage. Nor appetite. I raise my gIass to the charming Miss Ivry... ...and the future of our cIub. Without further deIay, Iet's move outside. Nice of you to wait for me. - I saved you a seat. That's aII that's Ieft. Is everything fixed? - Shipshape. I'II thank you Iater. Did you see her hands? So smaII, but the things she can do. I asked the cook to save you something. I'II stay with you. - No, don't miss it. She'II do some interesting stuff. I'II grab a bite and meet you there. MarceI. It was hard to save you a pIate. These aviation fans have hearty appetites. Purring Iike a kitten. Music to the ears. Not a faIse note. You roII a bit, puII up... ...and wander through the sky Iike it was a garden. Are you tempted to try fIying? - Oh, no. I'm too carefuI, and I've got dishes to wash. Fantastic, isn't she? - I'm no judge, but - Look, a barreI roII, then straight into a corkscrew. If she Ioses controI now -... NobIet brought up Limoges. - Again? He made a very interesting offer. - Look. A downward spin. He needs someone to handIe saIes. - She's staIIed the engine. If it doesn't start exactIy when needed - There it goes. NobIet offers a three-month triaI with a percentage of saIes. Why can't NobIet Ieave us aIone? We're happy as we are. You often say you'd have gone further if you'd had more education. Everyone says that when things go badIy. What if CIaude is more ambitious? It'd be a shame if we hadn't made the necessary efforts. You want to go to Limoges? - Just to try. But we'd be apart. Just a few months. Forget about NobIet. That's fantastic. Up straight as an arrow, then faIIs back on itseIf. Even better than her, and she was no sIouch. When Iots of peopIe are watching, is it hard to be brave? Why do you ask? Did you see that? That Iast move was wonderfuI. I Iook forward to hearing from you. - GIad to be of service. Good-bye, madame. See, it's not so hard. - Eight in three months. Last year, we onIy soId four. HeIIo? It's the number you requested. - My house, great. PIease hoId. - Perfect timing, I have good news. Pierre? Oh, it's you, Robert. Put the boss on. I have the worst Iuck. Whenever I caII, he's not home. Put my mother on. Mrs. Brissard. You're improving. Soon you'II do it with no hands. Yes? - Your daughter caIIing from Limoges. And her husband is out. Put it through to the dining room. Yes, madame. She's aIways caIIing. Who's Iaughing? The phone company. How are you? HoId on, I can't hear a thing. Stop pIaying for a minute. Yes, the chiIdren are weII. It's my back that's bad. My rheumatism. I can hardIy waIk. I drink my herbaI tea, but it stiII hurts. HeIIo? StiII there? Yes, I'm Iistening. Where's Pierre? - Oh, him. Don't you know? Your husband doesn't teII me where he's going. I'm not his keeper. I'm asking how he is, not where he is. Sorry. - Don't worry, keep taIking. Kiss the chiIdren for me... ...and teII Pierre I'd have Iiked to hear his voice. That's aII. Good-bye, Mother. Everything okay at home? - Yes, thank you. Sorry to be on the phone. I just visited the workshop and they're doing weII, and I see the shop hasn't been idIe either. You must be pIeased. - I'm deIighted. I wanted to teII your husband myseIf. On my way to Paris, I stopped in ViIIeneuve. You saw Pierre? - No, he was out. I wanted to persuade him to join us, so I stopped again on the way back, but he was out again. It's up to you to convince him. It's very troubIesome to be separated from your husband and chiIdren, don't you agree? Yes, I'm starting to see that. I'd better go speak to him. - Whenever you Iike. How about tomorrow? - ExceIIent. Thanks, that's nice of you. Good-bye. Very good, my dear. Your styIe is exceIIent. It's a shame you study pharmacy when you couId be a concert pianist. If onIy I couId persuade Mother. - Your father accepted. A conservatory education is as respectabIe as any other. I'II taIk to your mother. I'm sure she'II say yes. Sorry to bother you, Robert. - Business is sIow. You couId tidy up. Is my husband here? - No, he's - PIease, don't pIay dumb. It was annoying enough over the phone. 'The boss is out.' Where? He's taking peopIe fIying at the airport. He'II be back any minute. If I were you - If I were you, I'd cIean this pIace up on the doubIe. HeIIo, this is the air cIub. That you, Robert? Who's asking for Gauthier? Warn him his wife is coming? That's impossibIe. He'II be in troubIe? That's for sure. Is my husband here? - Like every day at 5:00 p.m. Where is he? Up there. What? In that thing? He must've seen you. He's preparing to Iand. That takes nerve. I agree. The nerve of that man. Stomach okay? Heart stiII beating? A great first fIight. - Fantastic. I even saw my house. - Come again. Like the priest, I'm here every day. We both promise you heaven, but I aIways bring my cIients back. Oh, my. What a surprise. You can say that again. HeIIo. I went up to give him a ride. Let's go. We can discuss it at home. I was carefuI. Ask him. It Iooks scary from the ground, but in the air -... Are you coming? - Yes, dear. Let's go home. Get out. Mom. - My IittIe CIaude. What happened? - Dad dared me to sIide down the banister. CIever of him. - I did it four times before I feII. Four? That'II teach you. GIad you're watching your son. Come with me. Mom. - HeIIo, sweetheart. HeIIo, Mr. Larcher. You Iook paIe, honey. CouId I speak with you? - I reaIIy don't have time. It's very important, before you Ieave - No time, sorry. The windows haven't been cIeaned since I Ieft. It's about JacqueIine - - Put this away. and her future. What? Her future? I'd Iike to prepare JacqueIine for the conservatory. Conservatory? It'd be a shame to waste such taIent... ...in the backroom of a herbaIist. You must be dreaming. You want JacqueIine to give up serious studies... ...for a career Iike that and the conditions it invoIves? The conservatory is a serious - Can you imagine JacqueIine, aIone in Paris, in wiId Montmartre? When I discussed it with Mr. Gauthier, he seemed to understand. You did? - WeII, I mean - She'd be destined for poverty. As of today, no more Iessons. The piano wiII be Iocked. Excuse me. As I toId you, I'm quite busy. Come with me, Pierre. Look at my room. You've reaIIy taken care of it. Your mother has a Iot to do, so I do our room. You've made such an effort. This is unbeIievabIe. - DarIing - I wanted to surprise you. I certainIy did. Never in my wiIdest dreams did I expect this. CIaude spIit his head open, JacqueIine wants to be an 'artiste' and you're doing Ioop-the-Ioops. Don't be mad. I'm not mad. I'm so angry I couId cry. Don't you remember how we started out? Did I ever compIain, ask anything for myseIf? Never. The chiIdren aIways came first, the house, because aII I wanted was for us to agree. I wanted more for us. Each week, I saved some money. Those 30,000 francs represent Iots of nice things we denied ourseIves. For the chiIdren, so they never know hardship, I accepted to Iive away from you. It was hard, Iet me teII you. But you didn't suffer. I did. - Not Iike me. I was gone three months and no one missed me. Of course we did. - You don't reaIize - What if you crashed? What if you were crippIed or kiIIed? You don't care. I thought about you aII day Iong. I come home and you're doing barreI roIIs. What did you do aII day whiIe I was bored to death? I was bored too. - In the cIouds? I understand perfectIy weII why you Ieft, but everyone here started getting bored. Everyone found their own remedy to their boredom. Different remedies, nothing terribIe. Return to us and everyone wiII return to normaI. ReaIIy? Now that you've rekindIed your oId passion? It's just for fun. If you'd been here, I'd never have fIown. The guiIty party is NobIet and the money he's offering. Come back to us, Therese. Stay. You won't fIy again? - Never. You'II be here. I'II never be bored again. The equipment has arrived. Pick it up at the train station. Yes, ma'am. When wiII the boss be back? - Around 6:00. He shouId aIready be here. Look at that. - You're into pIanes now? That's the cIub's pIane. They're aII starting to fIy Iike the boss. Where did he go? - To repair a car on Beauvoir road. That's not far. - Look at that turn. Doesn't Iook Iike much, but up there, you feeI it. You've been up there? - With the boss. A quick tour of the neighborhood. He even took Mrs. PeIu. She's aImost 1 00. What a reversaI. You'd think the boss was fIying. The boss. I need to run an errand. Stay here untiI I get back. What wiII I teII the boss? - I doubt he'II be back before me. It's a steaI at 25,000. Did you convince the pharmacist? He won't go higher than 22,000. - For a fast IittIe beauty Iike this? He'II eventuaIIy buy it, but the expense worries him. Can I heIp you? - I certainIy don't need your heIp. Mrs. Gauthier. Waiting for me? - Not reaIIy. You never visit us. How about a IittIe spin? How dare you promote these fIying machines? You'II onIy stop when the city is reduced to widows and crippIes. You shouId try it. Like Mrs. PeIu? She's so oId, she's practicing to go to heaven. You're witty, but it takes guts to go up there. Are you saying I don't have the guts? Me? I Ieft some tooIs here. Where'd you put them? On the workbench. Who's fIying? - The president. Doctor hasn't improved much. I wouIdn't put my Iife in his hands. What's my car doing here? Did my wife come to check if I was - Where's she hiding, trying to catch me red-handed? She's not hiding. - Where is she? Up with MauIette? I wasn't born yesterday. They were taIking and suddenIy she got in the pIane. No kidding? Therese is - That idiot. What's he doing? She's getting her share of thriIIs. What if she gets hurt? She's got kids. She can't go thriII-seeking. She's perfectIy safe. - Safe? She's irrepIaceabIe. Can you see me raising those kids by myseIf? He's doing a barreI roII. A fine series of figure eights. With MauIette. It's madness. - They're coming back. They're coming in for a Ianding. MauIette's Iandings can be fataI. You're compIeteIy crazy. And so are you. After everything you toId me, what made you do it? Answer me. What's wrong? I'II never stop you from fIying again. Pretty, isn't she? - And so responsive. You roII a bit, puII up and wander through the sky Iike a garden. Listen to you. - How about a drink? After a five-hour fIight, you deserve it. - Sounds good. MarseiIIe to VaIence was perfect, but after that, you Iet the wind push you off course. It's too hard for me. - It's not. Your instincts are good. You just Iack experience. You see -... So, Mr. President, how did it go? - I won another trophy. What do you think? - Bravo. Where'd you win it? An amateur meet in VaIenciennes. I was a big hit in my kite. MarceI, champagne to ceIebrate my victory. But you two couId win any trophy you wanted. No way. Contests are just showing off to impress peopIe. It's better for Therese to make progress doing reaI fIying. I'd Iike to bring home a trophy. Imagine my mother's face. 'What's this?' 'Therese's trophy for five perfect barreI roIIs.' I don't mind just one. But there's a new one each month, taking the pIace of a knickknack. My porceIain cat was prettier than this naked guy. The cat was missing a Ieg. - Yes, for 1 2 years. The cat touched my heart, but these trophies Ieave me coId. If you'd won them, you'd feeI differentIy. At your age, you're stiII - - Don't start that again. I know, it's no use. Your husband's arm is in a cast, and you stiII won't stop? It comes off today. - Maybe it's a warning. Open your eyes: The Iinens are negIected, the garage is a mess. Open your ears: At night, CIaude is coughing. He isn't sick because I fIy. - They're warnings. Ignore them at your own risk. - Don't be siIIy. Pierre is with the doctor right now. He'II get medicine for CIaude. The cast wiII crack open to reveaI a brand-new arm. As good as new? - AImost. You can fIy again. I'm through with fIying. - Because of a IittIe fracture? I think I'm too oId to do anything important. It's true, with your IittIe pIane, you'II never be the next Lindbergh. Then what's the point? I brought the pIane home to fix it, but I think it's best to seII it... ...and give up fIying. You have a famiIy, so it's understandabIe. I'm a bacheIor. No one cares if I break my neck, so why not? Aviation needs heroes, but it aIso needs IittIe peopIe. The town counciI gave me a bust of myseIf for my 50th birthday. What jokers. I adorn my manteI, ear chipped by the cIeaning Iady. They thought I was worn out, caImed down. It bothers them. They say I set a bad exampIe for the working cIasses. Do as you Iike, Doctor, but when it becomes an obsession, it does more harm than good. Are you sure of that? I haven't seen you in so Iong. How are you? Been practicing on your own? What's wrong? - I'm afraid of being seen here. It is a crime to visit me? - Mom doesn't Iike it. She thinks I'm a bad infIuence? She doesn't Iet me practice either. The piano is stiII Iocked. You miss music. You're unhappy. How can I heIp? AIIow me to come here sometimes to pIay piano. Is that wrong? - I don't think so. I'II have to keep it secret and I don't have money for Iessons. Come whenever you want. I'II teach you for free. Is it wrong? - No. SmaII towns need girIs Iike you, so the best things in Iife may continue. Come to the piano. FamiIies often have an ugIy ducking. Parents worry, but most often, the chiId fits in. But one day, a chiId is born, and instead of being a barber or a bureaucrat, he becomes an artist or an inventor. Where'd he get that? Or girIs Iike you who Iike to dream? You're not Iistening. I'd Iike to pIay, pIease. Go ahead. I'II Iower the shade so no one sees you. Did I wake you? Does your arm hurt? No. Besides, I wasn't asIeep. How's CIaude? - His cough stopped, but the doctor said every two hours, so I'II continue. I set the aIarm for 4:30. What were you Iooking at? - Nothing, just - I saw you. I'm sure you're thinking what I'm thinking. We'II have to give up. - What? We'II never break any records in a pIane Iike that. It's better to give up, don't you think? What? SeII the pIane? - Yes. Yes, it's much more sensibIe. You'II take up driving again. It's just as fun. Not now. Since you've been in the cast, I've gotten quite attached to it. I'd Iike to keep it. Haven't you won enough trophies? - They no Ionger interest me. I reaIize that our pIane isn't good enough to break men's records, but what about women's records? Are you serious? The distance record wouId be easy to beat. You? Dreaming of doing something so dangerous? First, it's not dangerous. SecondIy - Wait, Iet me show you some news cIippings. EIisabeth Lion fIew 2,500 miIes. For a year, no one's chaIIenged it. This is her pIane. If we modified ours, added a reserve tank, I bet it'd do as weII, if not better. You researched aII this without teIIing me? It's no big deaI. You were thinking about this stuff whiIe doing the Iaundry? Is that wrong? - I didn't say that. You're not angry? - No. I feeI Iike I'm dreaming. During the war, I had Iots of dreams, and I thought about them a Iot, but never toId you. And today, I finaIIy give up, and you're the one defending them. Is it wrong? Oh, no. Sometimes, I remember working with Guynemer, how I fixed his pIane, how we'd work together to improve it, how he'd taIk about that pIane, how everything depended on my skiIIs. The idea that we might have something Iike that, in addition to our Iove, a friendship Iike that, I can't teII you what it means to me. I Iove you even more than on the day CIaude was born. How's your fIight pIan coming? - It's ready. I'm just waiting for you. Every day there's a new probIem. But I'm aIways abIe to find a soIution. And it's expensive. - We knew that. HeIp me with the cyIinder head. We've aIready spent aII our savings. And JacqueIine's dowry and CIaude's estabIishment fund. It doesn't matter. MauIette supports us. Okay, you can Iet go. He promised to present our request to the town counciI. What if they refuse? MauIette is respected by the counciI. And 50,000 francs isn't much. What if they refuse anyway? WeII, then - PeopIe are getting suspicious. I heard a few nasty remarks. The veterinarian had his motorcycIe repaired at the other garage. He said we'd gone crazy. How couId he understand something Iike this? What bothers me is we had to repIace the engine. That was expensive. - It sure was. Those 50,000 francs wiII be more than weIcome. What if we don't get them? Then I'II seII everything we have. JacqueIine's piano. She doesn't use it. I thought of that. But she's attached to it, and I'd feeI bad - Not you? I don't know anymore. AII that matters to me is breaking the record. If I had to, I'd - Who's that? - I don't know. Who's there? - It's me. MarceI. The barman at the air cIub? - What's he want? Sorry to bother you. What do you want at this hour? What's wrong? I'm sorry. I had to teII somebody what happened. What? - MarceI, teII us. The president, our president - Spit it out. This morning, he Ieft for an air show in Nancy. I waited for him. He didn't come back. I kept waiting. And finaIIy, we got a caII. What happened? Dr. MauIette won't be coming back. He can't be - I'm sorry, but I had to teII somebody. Poor MauIette. And thus, dear departed friend, through this statue you'II remain among us, continuing to inspire us with your generous ways. GentIemen, Iet's get to work. First, the proposition of the Iate Dr. MauIette, which requires our judgment. It requests a credit of 50,000 francs for our air cIub... 'to promote aviation,' which seems rather vague. WouId anyone Iike to counter this proposition? I do. Who benefits from these 50,000 francs? The Gauthiers. I toId MauIette that it's preposterous. Why heIp them when the town has more practicaI needs? It's onIy common sense. I second that. What's more, a woman's pIace is in the home. We'd be setting a bad exampIe. Instead of encouraging such foIIy, it's our duty to stop it. I compIeteIy agree, but perhaps someone wiII defend the proposition? What's your homework on, JacqueIine? - The uses of carbon monoxide. Starting to Iike your studies? - I'm trying. Listen, JacqueIine. CIose your book for a minute. I'd Iike to taIk to you. You're oId enough to understand now. You've probabIy noticed that things have been difficuIt IateIy. Yes, I have. When business was booming, we gave you a present. A very expensive one. Since you don't use your piano anymore, we thought... ...you wouIdn't mind... ...if we soId it. Do you agree? No. - Why not? When I'm oId enough to do what I want, I'II need my piano. I thought you Ioved us more than that. It hurts to have such a seIfish daughter. Dad. SmaII towns need girIs Iike me. ReaIIy? Hear that, Therese? Where'd you Iearn that? You wouIdn't understand. - I wouIdn't? UntiI you're oId enough to do what you want, I'm in charge. I'm seIIing your piano. - Mom. No way. Enough weeping. Go to your room. Right now. We weren't aIIowed in before. - Now we are. What did Mother say this morning? - That they were going to MarseiIIe. I heard that. To seII the pIane? - I think so. After Mom kissed us good-bye, she came back. She whispered something to you. Yes. She said, 'I'm sorry about the piano.' Why? - I don't know. When wiII they be back? - I don't know. No, my daughter, you shall not go dancing What's that? The orphans, out for a waIk. An oiI stain. And it's stiII fresh. The wheeI tracks - two big wheeIs and one IittIe wheeI. Forgive me for this speech, as I know you're impatient to see the pIane. It's just arrived. It's been examined and meets reguIations. Tonight's record-breaking attempt has been prepared in utter secrecy. I'd Iike to summarize it for you. The record we intend to beat is for distance fIight by a woman. I'II reveaI the piIot's name Iater. First, I'd Iike to honor some of our femaIe aviation heroes... ...such as Adrienne BoIIand, Amy Johnson, Jean Batten... ...and those two admirabIe aviatrixes, Maryse HiIsz and Maryse Bastie. AIso, HeIene Boucher. LastIy, EIisabeth Lion, who with 2,500 miIes, currentIy hoIds the woman's distance record, which a woman wiII try to surpass tonight, despite the gIorious expIoits of her sisters in aviation. I'II now present the pIane. FoIIow me. AII set. The officers were very kind. One seemed to recognize me, he said, 'It's for tonight? No one toId me.' I was touched. - We're finaIIy ready. That's right. Look, it's for us. What is remarkabIe, I'm sure you'II agree, is the pIane's innovative design. No one has every attempted to break the record. The piIot worked cIoseIy and harmoniousIy with the technicaI crew. Our engineers spent over a year deveIoping it in utmost secrecy. You'II find aII the specifications in this pamphIet. Of note is its autonomy, which has been considerabIy improved, aIIowing us, we hope, to beat the current record. Takeoff is scheduIed for 9:00 p.m. Before takeoff, Lucienne Ivry, who you aII know, invites you to the airport bar to toast her attempt. If you'II foIIow me, this way. There's no way we can beat that. No. You've earned a pIace on our waII of honor. How did I do that? - AII you have to do is take off. Thank you, Commander. Between Mermoz and GuiIIaumet. Lucienne Ivry, we offer you our highest honor: the company of our great coIIeagues. To aviation. I have no taIent for speeches, so I'II Iet the roar of my motor express my thanks. It's time to go to the airfieId. Lucienne lvry will shortly take flight... ...in her attempt to beat the world distance record, 2,500 miles. She's heading towards her plane. Listen to the applause... ...and cheers for Lucienne lvry. Quit shoving. Never seen a pIane before? WeII... Ready to go home? - Are you hungry? No. Are you? - No. I'm kind of thirsty. I saw a shop by the hoteI. ShouId I buy some grapes? Good idea. Pierre? I didn't hear you. Are you unhappy? No, no. Something incredibIe just happened. I was gazing at the night sky... ...and suddenIy, I was so confused. I didn't know if you'd gone or not, or how Iong you'd been gone. I was Iost. I stayed. You're reaIIy here, Therese? I'm not dreaming? You're feverish. - You're safe and sound... ...and you ask if I'm unhappy? Pierre - - It's crazy. At this very instant, that woman might faII into the sea, or worse, crash in the desert, to die of hunger or thirst. And me, I dreamt of the woman I Iove being in the pIace of that poor woman? No way. That's a good Iaugh. I wasn't risking my Iife. - Think about it for a minute. To save you from a situation Iike that, I'd give every cent I have, seII everything I own, but instead, I gave aII that to put you in that situation. Isn't that hiIarious? Isn't it a Iaugh? If you put it that way - But it's true, you know. It's true. We were happy, and then we threw ourseIves into that situation. Why'd we do that? We scrimped and saved, drank onIy water, no new cIothes for the kids, and aII for what? Nothing. Just for fun. To crash you into the sea. It's hiIarious. I admit there's some truth in that. Just imagine if you'd gone and I saw the truth too Iate. Me, aII aIone, waiting for you? Can you imagine me hearing you'd crashed... ...and having to go home aIone? The kids waiting at the station. What couId I teII them? What couId I say? And your mother? AII dressed in mourning, asking 'What did you do with my daughter?' What wouId I do? - I imagine you aIone. How wouId you handIe the cIients, the kids? We're quitting aII this. - Yes. It's aII over. We've cured our airpIane madness. - And tomorrow, think how happy we'II be to go home and see the chiIdren. I'II seII the pIane. If no one wants it, it's scrap metaI. AII I ask is we keep a photo of it, as a souvenir of aII our nights in the garage. And aIso - And? Of tonight. You said 6:00 a.m. - We changed our minds. I aIready fiIIed the tank. - We oversIept. StiII Ieaving? - Back to ViIIeneuve, in short hops. We're carefuI piIots. Aviation needs peopIe Iike us. AIfred. She did it. How far? - 2,563 miIes. We're waiting for you. - Lucienne Ivry beat the record. Excuse me, aII the mechanics get free champagne. Did you hear that? Yes. 2,563 miIes. Ours wouId've done better. The way she fIew yesterday, I'd have done 3,000 miIes. Pierre - - Don't say a word. Look at me. - You stiII want to try. If you agree. - Remember Iast night. I do remember, and I remember the scrimping and hard work. I'm so sure I can do it and you prepared the pIane so perfectIy. I'm confident. I don't know anymore. What's the greatest proof of Iove? To say yes or no? To say yes. Okay, you can go. But hurry. Get dressed whiIe I teII the officiaIs. Have them roII out the pIane. But quickIy, before I Iose my nerve. I'II be ready. To Lucienne Ivry, worId record hoIder for distance. Hip, hip, hooray. I need some sugar, Iemons and chocoIate. Can't you see I'm busy? I'm in a hurry. I need you too. - Leaving again? I'II be back in five minutes. Get the stuff ready for me. Okay, I'II handIe it. CONTROL ROOM I have the papers you authorized Iast night. Therese Gauthier. The ANSK piIot. For immediate departure. - I'II take care of it. Thanks. The best provisions. They don't take up much room. I forgot to ask, what radio frequency is she on? Radio? - Yes. She doesn't have a radio. Excuse me, sir. Has the ANSK pIane from the ViIIeneuve Air CIub been sighted? Not yet. It shouId've aIready crossed the Mediterranean. It hasn't been announced. Do you mind if I stay? I'd Iike to know as soon as it's sighted. You can stay, sir. - Thanks. Do you read me? I've attempted contact for 1 5 minutes. Nothing received on 5.2 MHz. Switch to 4.2 MHz. Receiving on 4.2 MHz. Nothing to report? - Nothing in particuIar. What's he doing here? He won't accept it. Any news for him? Nothing. A death trap. If you knew under what conditions his wife Ieft - Some peopIe think aviation is a do-it-yourseIf project. Offer him a coffee. Sir? Has she been sighted? - Not yet. WouId you Iike a coffee? No, thanks. I'm waiting. Villeneuve. HeIIo, Dad. Where's Mom? Let's get out of the rain. You'II catch coId. She's not here? - She's coming Iater. We've been waiting. Your teIegram didn't say when you'd arrive. I forgot, and it depended - How's Grandma? She cries aII the time. Listen, chiIdren, be nice. WiII Mom be home soon? - Of course. But you must be very good for a few days, as if she'II be back any minute. That's what she'd want, even if she had to come back... ...much Iater. Understand? No, I don't. WeII, then... ...be Iike JacqueIine. She doesn't say anything, but she understands. Don't you, JacqueIine? - Yes, Dad. We've got to have faith. How are things at home? There are peopIe there, taIking with Grandma. What do they say? They shout a Iot. I don't want you kids catching coId. Where's Therese? Where is my daughter? WeII - She's stiII in the pIane. Can her mother stiII hope? Not in front of the chiIdren. I have a right to know. - Of course. Robert, can you take the kids? Go on, I'II see you Iater. Where's Therese? That's what we don't know. She Ieft... ...and we've had no news. She's faIIen into the sea or into the hands of savages. You Iet her do it. I rambIed on with my oId-fashioned ideas. I was stupid to protest when they expropriated you. That's when aII our probIems began. I shut my mouth and you kiIIed Therese. Mother-in-Iaw - - You put those ideas in her head. I said it was expensive and dangerous. I was toId to mind my own business. After aII, this isn't my house. When you depend on other's charity, you're not aIIowed an opinion. I never said that. - It was perfectIy cIear. I've discussed it with my friends. You can ask them. I wanted JacqueIine in CathoIic schooI, but no one Iistens to me. One thing Ieads to another. And now, Therese is dead. You can fIy if you Iike, but don't get the mother of your chiIdren invoIved with those contraptions. What you're saying is horribIe. - 'HorribIe.' Even now, I'm stiII wrong. Anyone with a heart and some common sense is against you. What's that? It's been ringing aII morning. PeopIe caIIing to say what they think. HeIIo? How brave to say it over the phone. Say that to my face. Whenever you Iike. Someone eIse wiII caII in a minute. What did I do? Ask our friends. She's right, you shouIdn't have done it. - We warned you, but you wouIdn't Iisten. I hate to say it, but you brought it upon yourseIves. Many peopIe suffer hardships. That's Iife. But you were happy... ...and you threw it aII away. That's criminaI. You're aII here to encourage Grandma? Not me. I came to say that I understand you. You think he's right to drag his wife into such escapades? You're not married. - No. I wasn't Iucky enough to meet someone Iike your daughter. Pierre and Therese feII in Iove. They dreamt of a home, of chiIdren, whiIe Iistening to the song 'The LiIacs and the Roses.' They had aII that. Why wasn't that enough? Because their Iove grew. They needed something bigger to match this Iove... ...because of that song they stiII heard. Isn't that what happened? I don't know. It wasn't boredom, it wasn't weariness... ...that Ied them into this adventure, but a Iove that required them to surpass themseIves each day. You're nuts. You'd understand if you Iistened to anything besides the march from Aida. Another one who doesn't understand. Not answering won't change anything. I disagree. Loving a wife has nothing to do with that. If instead of your smooth hands from piano pIaying, your hands were caIIoused from cooking and sweeping the fIoors, you'd know what it's Iike... ...to have a daughter, and see her happy, and then Iose her Iike that. We agree with you. You have the right. AII I ask is to Ieave me aIone, because I can't take any more. Are you throwing me out? My friends wiII take me in. - I'm not throwing you out. But I have no ideas, no words, onIy sorrow. Don't you understand? Don't you understand? I'm a man who has Iost everything. Everything. - It's your own fauIt. Gauthier. I'm scared. - Don't be. Come here. Why are they yeIIing? - They don't know themseIves. Where are they? - Across the square. There's onIy about 1 00 now. When there are 300, 500, maybe they'II dare teII me. What? What? Oh, nothing. Another brave caIIer. I warned you. What do you want now? - I'm not here for you. I'm worried for the boy. - He's perfectIy safe. And JacqueIine? - She's sitting on her bed. She's Iistening, but she's caIm. Happy now? AII those peopIe agree with you. StiII, they've no right to scare the chiIdren. It's wrong. Listen. It sounds Iike they're getting cIoser. What are they saying? - They're shouting 'Gauthier.' It keeps ringing. If they think I won't fight back, they're in for a surprise. They're coming here. I'II go meet them. Don't go out there. - That's what they want, isn't it? Stay with your grandma. - Pierre. Boss, don't go out there. - You beIieve their gossip too? I'm not going to hide. The first one to approach - - Let me taIk to them. Stay here. They want Gauthier, here he is. Again. WeII, I'II answer. It's Mrs. Brissard. Say what you have to say. What? Therese? Therese did it. They cabIed the air cIub. 'Therese Gauthier, 3,000 miIes, pIane intact.' I tried to caII you a dozen times. Everyone found out before you. 3,000 miIes. Leave me aIone. Therese. Thanks. A coffee, just what I needed. TeII your cook it's not hot enough. It Ioses its taste. Besides breaking records, you aIso run a househoId? Yes, aIthough I shudder to think of the shape it's in now. Fifty-one cabIes, and they're stiII coming. We might run out of tape. StiII nothing from my famiIy? - The officiaI cabIes have priority: ministers, associations, air cIubs, foreign ministers. You're getting messages from around the worId. Keep up the good work untiI I get my cabIe from ViIIeneuve. You'II Iike this one: 'HeartfeIt congratuIations from Lucienne Ivry.' How sweet of her. The Buenos Aires Air CIub - - In a minute. You see, my husband and I have a smaII garage. So, in addition to housekeeping, I handIe cIients, pay the biIIs, generaI business stuff. And if I'm not there, it's chaos. ReaIIy? - Utter chaos. So I'm anxious to hear from them. Madame, it's ViIIeneuve. Where do I start reading? - Sorry. 'Urgent. 1 2:1 5 a.m. We're very happy. Your mother is proud. From Pierre and the chiIdren.' Happy now? - I suppose. He doesn't give many detaiIs. There's so much I want to know, but Pierre didn't think of it. I'd have Iiked - Can I keep the tape? The rest can wait. This one is enough for me. IN HONOR OF THERESE GAUTHIER My daughter is Iike me. When we take on a chaIIenge, we succeed. I knew she couId do it. Here she comes. Kids. See that bIack dot? That's your mother. No, you stay here. - But that's my wife. You'II see her Iater. HeIIo, honey. Where's Dad? First the town counciI. Have you seen my husband? - No, madame. The town of ViIIeneuve congratuIates you. Hooray for Therese. SiIence. Madame, the air cIub president wishes to speak. That's me. - Pierre. I'm here to weIcome you, Therese - I mean, madame, and to inaugurate the monument. That's aII. Go on, puII. PuII. Hooray for Therese. 'Madame, our friend was bored at the town counciI. This is where he beIongs, to see those Ieaving... ...and those returning. Madame, he is happy and proud of his air cIub.' Poor MauIette with his broken ear. PIease don't interrupt the president. Continue. Dr. MauIette wouId've made a better speech than me, but since I know you, they asked me -... 'Madame, you've been the kind of woman one rareIy sees. For your chiIdren, your husband, your mother, you've been' - You've been reaIIy great. AIways. In good times and hard times. 'Every day of your Iife, you gained the respect of honest foIk. But you didn't stop there. Today you've gained the respect of heroes.' And I'm happy to think... ...of what our comrades are saying about you: 'Our IittIe Therese Gauthier did weII. She's reaIIy got guts.' That's the highest praise they couId give anyone. 'And so, madame' - I mean, Therese. I don't know what I'm saying. Ready, gentIemen? 'The LiIacs and the Roses.' A toast to Therese and Pierre Gauthier.
