Look at that guy. What a weirdo! Look... Why don't we kill him? Down with the... Why? Don't you think so, too? I respect... Everyone has their own ideas. It's all about ideas. Do you have lizards? What? Lizards! Well, if I can do you a favour... But I am a poor man, a cappuccino. If you are not offended, I... Green beasts going bang bang bang. A cult! Political fanaticism. But I'll say it anyway. Down with the government! I don't like this, Slim. I don't like it when you shoot an unarmed man. Please! Please! I'll kill you! Long live liberty! - Pietro Micca! - Were you trying to be De Chirico? THE GUYS IN THE PARIOLI DISTRICT Man! There must be a lot of cool people in there. - Yeah, but I don't think they'll let us in. - Oh, please. Hey! Look at the landlord's new car. The typical rich man's car. I've always said it: Giorgio Carlo has no taste. So what do we do now? What do we do? We call them. Susy! - Susy! - No need to shout! They can't hear you with such noise. Then we'll call them together. Gegé! Susy! Lullo! Gegé! - Look who's here! - Hey! No need to shout. Giorgio Carlo couldn't care less about you. What does it mean? It means that you are dumped! Watch out, you might fall down! Bloody louts! You don't want me, huh? - I will destroy you! - Forget it. You don't invite me to parties, so I take revenge. You asked for it. Goodnight! Fabrizio says bye! Mr. Roberto? Mr. Roberto, wake up! What is it? There is Mister Fabrizio looking for you. Screw you! Don't bother me. Good morning, madam. - Hi, Fabrizio. - I'm waiting for Bob. Roberto is resting now, then he has to study. He has exams. Right. Otherwise he will have to do military service. A little hard living can only do you good. Huh, my father says I'm a lost cause. But he doesn't get angry anymore. He's given up. All you know how to do is dance and have fun. Of course. When should we have fun if not when we're young? Besides, our parents have a good life. They buy mink coats and luxury cars. We are angels compared to them. We make do with the 1,000 lire a day they give us. Madame, the mister says he is still sleepy and asks for brioches for when he wakes up. Poor child! - All right, let me do it. - Madam, please, tell Bob that I'll wait for him at the club. Thank you. Have you all become paralysed? Grandma! -Damn! - What is the need to shout like this? Where's your manners? I yelled because you weren't answering me. What a place! You're blinding me! Plus... I don't see any brioche. You know that when I don't eat breakfast I can't smoke. All I know is it's a shame to sleep this late. You think you can do it because your parents aren't here. Did they leave? - Exactly. - Good. They said goodbye to you this morning. And you didn't even notice. They could have chosen another time. Did they expect me to get up at dawn? - Have Mr and Mrs Mariani left? - Yes. - Early this morning. To Paris. - Good. Tell me... - Ever been to Paris? - Me, in Paris, mister? Yes. In Paris, you could be the queen of the striptease. - Stript what? - You don't have to worry. - I'll explain to you. - Let go of me, mister! If Madame sees you... I don't care about her. Watch it, Susy! Maria! Please, stop it! - You're always being an idiot. - I'm not an idiot. - I'm an ace. I'm a champion. - Please. You're just stupid. There's only one champion here: Fabrizio. Aka "the dumped guy". Last night at the party Giorgio Carlo closed down as soon as he smelled those two. Fabrizio had promised him to get them to crash two parties the other week, - but he couldn't. - I've tried everything. But, you know... No luck. Please. I'm happy for Fabrizio. This fool wrote on the mirror in my house - that my father is gullible. - And he is right. Are you jealous? All you can talk about is Fabrizio. - Are you winning? - I'm robbing them. I won seven games. You're such a stickler for games. Watch out! You're making me miss. What a big problem! It's the least you deserve after this morning. You'll tell me what you were thinking. Damn it! You really are bad luck. You show up and I lose the game. Last night between the party and that fool I couldn't talk to you about something. I have a great idea. Your parents are out of town, right? - So what? - Are you really asking that? Let's use your house to organize a big movement. - We'll never get this chance again. - Are you crazy? - What about Grandma? - I'll take care of the old crone. - You'll kill her? - No, I have another idea. Which is what? A good telegram. - A telegram? - Sure. An urgent telegram. It's a breeze. I'll take care of it. Fabrizio, I don't understand. I'm going to play tennis. - Bob. -Fabrizio! Aren't you coming for a swim? No, I can't right now. - Man, you're not getting laid. - Go to hell! - You're really touchy! - Help me. Why are you getting so angry? Everyone knows that he doesn't look at you even when... You're in your bathing suit. Don't laugh. - Can't I? - Exactly. She is angry today. Laugh it up. And what about the maid? Damn it! I hadn't thought of that. Couldn't you soften her up a bit? - Are you nuts? She stinks. - Who cares? You could spray some eau de cologne on her. You're so naive. We can do it on Thursday. It's her day off, right? Yes, but that's not the point... - It just seems tricky. - It's not tricky. You know what? You're unbelievable! You're a piece of work. Unbelievable! If you don't want to do it, that's your loss. Why is it my loss? I had a little something planned for you that.... - You can't even imagine. - What is it? Here. Look. THE ULISSE FILM COMPANY IS LOOKING FOR A BEAUTIFUL GIRL, AGED 18-22, FOR THE LEADING ROLE IN ITS FORTHCOMING PRODUCTION "IL TARTARO MALEDETTO". Don't you think it's a great idea? We pose as producers. We can easily find a girl who takes the bait. Hello? Is this Miss De Mea? This is Ulisse Film Company. Could you come to our office on Thursday afternoon? We'd like to see you about a role in our next film. Yes, exactly. "Il tartaro maledetto". Yes, you know... It's a very important role. What? Who am I? - Who am I? - The secretary. I'm the producer's private secretary. Mr. Fabrizio Bonaldo. Listen... The address is Via Valentini. The number is... - 28. - So... Via Valentini 28. Yeah, but... You'll have to search for Mr Mariani's apartment. Yes, right... My colleague. Third floor. - Apartment... - Nine. Nine. So... Third floor, apartment 9. Yes... yes. What? You, your mother and your sister. What happened? When I told her the address she laughed and spoke ill of Mum. We've accomplished nothing. I told you it doesn't work with them. They know who is the real secretary of the producer and also where is the Ulisse Film's office. Plus, you're calling real actresses. They're not real actresses. They are Misses. Cheap young ladies, expert girls... Who would do anything to be in the movies. I see. I don't... Perhaps we are doing it wrong. Hello? This is Mariani's House. Who's calling? It's Susy. She always looks for you everywhere! Do I hang up on her? No. Wait, I have an idea! Hello? Hi, little Susy. No! I was not angry. Listen... Could you come to Bob's house? I need to talk to you about something. Little Susy... If you come... I will give you lots of kisses on your chubby little cheeks. I was wrong about you. I thought you were less immature. So you think it's immature to refuse... To help you find women... Willing to entertain you and your idiot friend? Yeah, I thought you'd be a little more fun. After all... All you need to do is help us organize something new. And you say no. I didn't expect that. I didn't expect that at all. Besides... If you must know... The main reason I'm doing this... Is to help Bob. He's the one who thought we should have a party. You know... If he doesn't try these tricks... Caterina! Caterina! Caterina! Here I am, Mister. - Please, don't shout. - I shout as much as I like. Where's Grandma? - She's resting. - Good. Actually, bad, very bad. There's no ice there. That's unacceptable. I'll bring it right away. But wait... I've changed my mind. Caterina... You know the eau de cologne in the bathroom? It's yours now. - Looking for the Mariani house? - Exactly. - Third floor, apartment 9. - Thanks. How did you know he had to go to Bob's house? Well, Fabrizio knows everything. Fabrizio, the magic little sorcerer. So? You gonna help us? Good girl. That's my girl. Come on, let's go. - But... What are you doing? - Wait a moment. Okay. We did it! Good! Come down, come on! Everything worked perfectly. Amazing! - What worked perfectly? - Well... everything. I'll tell you later, don't worry. She almost had a stroke when she read the telegram. - Hi, Susy. - So? Is she leaving? - Yes, she's leaving. - Great. She didn't even want to pack her bags. What about you guys? Susy is in. She'll make the calls. Great. But on one condition. - What? - I want to be part of the movement too. Hey, but... You're crazy! - Not a chance. - You don't accept? Then find someone else. - You're stupid. - And you're an idiot. - Don't start a fight, okay? - You boor! Listen, Fabrizio... - Tell her to stop or I'll... - Or what? - Tell me. - Come on, little Susy... Stop arguing. - He always starts it. - Okay, but it's enough now! So... back to the point. - You say you want to be part of the movement. - Exactly. Fine. But... how can we do that? 'Cause I really don't know. You tell us. You won't tell me I embarrass you, I hope. - Well... - I... I'll pose as the secretary. Just as you want me to do over the phone. I want to see the girls and how the evening will go. I'm not asking too much, since I'm doing you a favour. Don't you think? Fine. What do you think, Bob? Well... It is more about you than it is about me. I mean... It's your house. Fine. - As long as she doesn't annoy us. - Fine. I'll only annoy you if you won't get anything, as I expect. I bet 10,000 lira on that. - Are you starting this again? - No, let me do it. Let's bet on it then. - 10,000 lira. Let's do it. - Deal. So you have a deal? Then no more angry faces and make up. Come on, Susy, let's go. Now the fun begins. Here's a phone. It's your turn now. So... The first victim is... Grazia Zago. Phone number: 739007. Excuse me, do you know where Via Valentini is? - Right there, don't you see? - I'm sorry. No need to be rude. Who does he think he is? So it's understood, Pietro. - Remember: no one must know anything. - Don't worry, Mister. Ulisse Film, third floor. Go and have fun. - I'm counting on it. - You don't have to worry. I hope we get the part. Don't get your hopes up or you'll be disappointed. As I've often been. They must have already seen hundreds of girls, so let's not expect them to give the part to us. If you're sure we won't get the part, why did you come then? Well... You try in vain a thousand times... And then maybe one day... Mister, I'm leaving. Do you need anything else? Did you spray the whole bottle of eau de cologne? Why? Can you smell it? Can I smell it? You smell like... Like a perfume shop. A greenhouse. A carnation warehouse. Do you know... You're beautiful? I think you do. Come here! Let go of me! What are you doing? Get off me! Stop! Someone's here. Let go of me! - Someone's here! - Caterina! Caterina! Do you leave me like this? - Good morning, Caterina. - Good morning, Miss. Hi, Caterina. Hi, Bob. Well? How are you doing? - Are you okay? What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong. Everything's okay. Cheer up, Bob. - You won't win the bet otherwise. - Listen... Please. They should be here by now, we told them to come at 5:00 p.m. - It's 10 minutes to 5:00. - What? This is an endless road. Look! We're here, there's the 28. Miss Grazia! Oh, no! He's here. He's obsessed. How does he always know where I am? - Good morning, Miss! - Good morning! What a nice coincidence! I just happen to be here... You're always where I am, huh? Yes. May I? This is accountant Giuseppe Spallotta. -She's a colleague of mine. - Yes. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - I would like to... - What now? - If you don't mind, I'd like to walk you... - No, no need to. We have an appointment with a producer. For a contract. I'll be waiting for you then. You don't have to. We might finish late and yet he wants to wait for us. Excuse-me. Do you have an appointment with the Ulisse Film? - Yes. - Exactly. Mr Mariani informed me. They're waiting for you upstairs. Third floor, apartment 9. Are there many girls up there? No, you were the only ones summoned. - Thank you. Come on, let's go. - I'll wait for you here then. Do as you like, I can't waste my time. Goodbye. - Who is he? - A suitor of mine. He's been courting me for a year. The worse I treat him, the more he wants me. He wants to marry me. As if I'd marry a wretch like him! It's understandable, you know? The film industry leads people to be... A bit vague. Being in this business, always talking about art... That makes you... A bit elusive, you know. You are the man of the elusive woman? Well... Not really her man. A little less. - I'm her suitor. And she knows that. - Oh, she knows. She knows how I feel about her, and very well. For over a year now. She's the one who hasn't made a decision yet. She doesn't have to stop being an actress once we're married. If that's her passion, she should pursue it. I don't think I know her. What films has she acted in? - What do you mean? In many films. - Really? Let's see... Just to name one... Fabiola. She was only 11 years old. But the best she acted in was the one with Robert Taylor. - Robert Taylor? - Quo vadis. - Didn't you seeQuo Vadis? - Yes, I did. - Then what? - I don't remember her. - You know the triclinium scene? - Yes. When Robert Taylor says: "I want to be a plebeian too." And then he kneels down. - Yes. - That's it. The moment he kneels down, in the back right-hand corner you see a girl eating grapes. She is only shot for a few seconds because immediately a centurion arrives and takes the scene. She even shouts at the centurion. - Didn't you see that? - Maybe I was absent-minded. Well, you know... This is a short scene, so if you don't pay attention to it... Will it be long before they finish? Well, my dear... - I don't know. - Right. How can you know? You're absent-minded. - Iacovoni. - It's here. - Can I ring the bell? - Wait, let me comb my hair first. I'm a little nervous. Come on, don't act like a child. Bob, will the whiskey be enough? I'm more likely to be short of bread than whiskey. There's enough for an entire regiment. My beloved Belafonte. How about some calypso music? No. No music. They might get suspicious. You anticipate everything, little Fabrizio, don't you? They're here. Guys... Please, let's stay calm. We must remain calm. Bob, don't get confused. Go into the other room and then come back very casually. Make sure you don't screw up. And, Susy... You open the door and when the time is right, you leave. How do I know when the time is right? Don't worry, you'll figure it out. Put on the glasses, they'll make you look more serious. You look nervous, Fabrizio. It seems like you've never seen a woman before. Stop it, go open the door. Hello? Miss, please... No, I'll double. I'll triple it. She doesn't want to do it? We'll replace her with someone else. All right, Casan. Don't worry, the producer agrees with me. Everything I do is fine with him. Yes, of course. You can call Brigitte Bardot. The film must be finished no matter what. 60 million? What? 60 million? - Fine. - Who does he think he is? 60 million, but not a penny more. As soon as I get to Hollywood, I get my revenge. All right, then. I'll tell the producer. Goodbye, Casan. Goodbye. They are...? The Ladies were summoned two days ago - for Il tartaro maledetto. - Oh, right. Good. Names? Nuccia... Nuccia Gagliardi. And Grazia Zago. We came together because we are friends. She told me about the role and so... We decided to come here together. Amazing! What a coincidence! Friends, right? Childhood friends, I bet. - Lovely. - No... - Not really. - No? Oh, okay. Did you... Take note of everything? - Yes. - Great. Tell Mr Mariani that the Ladies are already here. You know, I want him to join us too. Listen... Take the phone away because I don't want to be disturbed. Yes, sir. For any reason. Mademoiselle, you can leave if you want. I don't need you anymore. All right, sir. And... Good luck. So... You're Miss Nuccia... And you're Miss Grazia. Has my secretary given you all the information yet? Not really. She just told me to come and show us. She told me the same. That's bad. Really bad. Really, really bad. Well, I guess I'll do it. So... Surely you've heard of Il tartaro maledetto. Right? Well? What do you do? Are you leaving? Yes. I know when the time is right. Aren't you happy? - I leave the field to you. - I don't care. And... Is the bet still on? Whatever you say. I don't care. - But... I never expected this. - Never expected what? That seeing Fabrizio having fun with... I mean... Choosing those two over you... Would upset you so much. Oh, here's Mr Mariani. - Good evening. - Good evening. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - They are here for the role. The secretary mentioned it to me. - Sorry for the wait. - Don't worry. I give you the details. So... Miss Grazia has already played a few roles in films. - Great. - But nothing important. While Miss Nuccia... Is at her first experience. I see. I explained to the Ladies what we are looking for. We need to find a fresh face. A protagonist. We'd like to find a new star. That's why, after a long search and a careful evaluation of the girls recommended by theCineguida, we have summoned the best ones for a, let's say, personal examination. - Miss Grazia brought her pictures. - Here they are. Unfortunately, Miss Nuccia did not. I wasn't thinking. But I have them at home. I can go and get them, if you want. No need to. There's always a remedy. Bob, do you want some whiskey? Yes, thanks. I guess you ladies do too, right? A little. Thank you, Mister. Nice body. And those legs! They're perfect! - You are too kind. - No, it's the truth. Terrific! Well, it's a pity you didn't bring your pictures too. But... I told you that I can go get them. Yeah, it's a bit of a problem. You know, that's a very sexy role. The story takes place mostly at sea. On the Caucasus coast. I mean... In the Caspian Sea. And the protagonist is often... She's half-naked in almost the whole film. She's a kind of wild woman, you know? A shameless... Troglodyte. - Yes, there are also some raunchy scenes. - But that's not certain yet. However, she is not completely naked, she has... - You think that's a small thing? - What's so strange? I mean... It makes it different, doesn't it? Well, now is not the time... To talk about it. As I said, it's not certain yet. But we have to give the producer an answer by this evening. So it's necessary for us to really understand... What your physical possibilities are. But... How? By undressing in there and then... Showing us your bodies. Well, yes. Are you uncomfortable with that? That's not good. I'm surprised at you, Miss Zago. You should be used to this by now. Are you actresses or children? We're not children. Come on, Nuccia. Let's go. Oh, great! I was beginning to doubt you. Where can we... - Get undressed? - This way, please. This way. Please, don't be afraid. We're gentlemen. What was that? Nothing, just a door slamming. Don't worry, Ladies. It was just a door. Please, come in. Go ahead. My goodness, what a fear! - I thought it was Grandma. - Damn, they are hot! Shut up, they can hear us! - The brunette's mine, got it? - Fine by me. I prefer the blonde. - Where is Susy? - I think she slammed the door. Thank God she left. What a child! First she's bold and then she's afraid. Let's drink. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Sorry. - Good morning, Miss! Thank God my glasses didn't fall off! That would have been a problem. Considering how much they cost. And these are for myopia, so they are not that expensive. Imagine if they had been mine... I'm astigmatic. - Then why are you wearing those? - Because I think it's a waste of money. I can see very well with these of Dad. Well, a little crooked but... He's retired now, so he doesn't use them much. He only uses them to read in the evening, but I'm always home by then. The problem is only when my brother needs to study. He can see. He can see very well, but... Since we have vision problems in our family, we make him wear them for prevention. - These ones? - Yes. Young people today are all visually impaired, all sick. I would kill them all. You have to be understanding, sir. Young people today are all a bit nervous, a bit impatient. Because they are suffering, you know? Maybe it's also because of atomic exhalation. - It's not the exhalation. - Yes, it is. And also because of the rockets to reach the moon. You think that's good for our health? All this gas they give off... It makes people crazy, you know? And yet they say it's necessary for progress. - Why do you care about progress? - Well... Because today we have nothing... I'm speaking for myself, of course. But tomorrow... We might have a little piece of land on the moon. And you think they'll give it to you? Why not? - My dear, you see this neighbourhood? - Yes. I had to pay a million for it. - A million? - With the help of some connections. And you're talking to me about rockets? - Rockets that cost billions of lire... - Yeah. Explode in the air, fall into the sea... - And all is lost. - Damn. Accountant... If we were given the money it takes to build a single screw... Of these rockets... I could sit and sunbathe at Posillipo. And I could go up to Grazia, take her by the arm and say: "Let's get out of here, silly girl." "Don't listen to your dreams, you need to be more attached to the earth. A woman is a woman and must stay at home." He's still there. Unbelievable. I think... He's really crazy. Either he's crazy or he really loves me. This house is beautiful, isn't it? And they're very young, I think they're not even 25 yet. It's true that in the film business, you get ahead quickly. Come on, get undressed! Hurry or they'll get tired of waiting. What's wrong? - I was thinking about Pino. - Who's Pino? The guy I was going to marry. If he could see me now... Poor Pino! He had tears in his eyes when he took me to the station. You know what? You'll never make films if you keep thinking about him. Then why don't you go home to your Pino? Because I'm ashamed. Because... If I came back with nothing accomplished... Everyone would make fun of me. You don't know my town. No, I just can't go back home. I must succeed. At all costs. Then you should start taking your clothes off. I bet paladins take their armour off in a lot less time. What are they doing? Imagine if they showed up now as two hideous monsters. - Don't be silly! - How spectacular that would be! Easy on the whiskey, you can't handle it. But... They really took their clothes off! Look at that! Please, Ladies. Oh, you're fantastic! Drink a drop! You'll need it for what you are going to do. - And what are we going to do? - We need to get a closer look at you. It's not so easy to check your bodywork. You are two Cadillacs! How nice! More whiskey! - You want to get us drunk? - Don't be shy. Can we go get dressed now? Oh, please. Are you cold or something? - We can' t stay like this all the time. - No. Just five or ten minutes. This is work, so... This is about millions of lire. Millions, you see? Millions. - Come on, more whiskey! - No, I can't handle it. - Better that way, I assure you. - Of course. Will you please tell us what you want to do? The leg game. - What's that? - I'll show you. Let's see. You must stand next to each other and we will judge which of you has the best legs. It's like a contest. It's nice, isn't it? May the leggy one win! Ladies, step back, please. That's it. Good, very good. - Pay attention, Bob. - Yeah, don't worry. Great! Now pull up your skirt. Come on. Please, go ahead. You too, Miss Nuccia. Come on! - That's it. Higher. - Higher. - A little higher. - Higher, come on! There you go. Pull it up. - Higher, higher. - Great! Enough now. - About-face! - Sir, do we look like soldiers to you? We need to see your backs too, don't I? Let's see your backs. To be able to act in our very important film, legs are very important. Are you crazy? Do you want to screw this up? You can't handle whiskey. I can even dress my salad with whiskey. Ladies! Pay attention, please. I will create the atmosphere. The drums roll, the audience applauds the Venus finalists enthusiastically. The lights go out... A huge spotlight sends a silver beam over the two Venuses. Here comes the jury! On with the music! Music for the jury! Music! He's a little tipsy but don't worry, he's harmless. Come on, dance with me. That will distract him. Like this? I'm cold. You're cold? I can get you a kimono. - Thank you.- You're welcome. I couldn't hold it in any longer. Nice bathroom, very well maintained. - It looks like a living room. - Yeah, pretty good. In the commander's bathroom on the third floor... - When you take out the toilet paper... - Yes. The carillon plays. - Really? - Yeah. Wow! - They're very refined people. - I bet they are. Since you've decided to wait here, why don't you sit down? No, thanks. I'll stand because I've got new shoes on, and they make a lot of noise, I don't know if you've noticed. I always feel like I'm walking over two frogs. Croac, croac, croac. All the more reason for you to sit down. - Yeah. - Go sit down. No, I prefer to stand because... The weight of my body compresses the soles of my shoes so that they stop making noise. At first it takes a bit of sacrifice, as in all things, but then as time goes by, the foot takes the shape of the shoe - without even noticing it. - Just like in Japan. Well, yes. - Yes, you're right. - Look, you do as you like. - I have to leave you for a minute. - Go ahead. - Could you do me a favour? - Yes. If anyone calls for me, tell them I'll be right back. - Don't worry. - Thank you, you're very kind. You're welcome. I'll be here. Mr. Pietro! - Where's the doorman? - He had to leave for a moment. I can tell him what you need. - I'll leave you my dog, I'll be right back. - But... Be good! Then we'll wait. Where are you going? Wait! She'll be right back. She'll be right back! Be good! Miss, I'm not gonna watch your dog. You want to play? Let's play! Easy! Easy, please! You want to play with my shoe? Easy, you'll break it. I'll give it to you. You're breaking it, I'll take it off. Here. Here's my shoe. There it is. That's the foot. Here's the other one. I gave you both. - I gave you both! - I'm back, here's your food. - His food. - All for you. You like it, huh? It's good. - Excuse-me. Thanks. - You're welcome. - What can I say? - What that man wanted to do to you? Did he scare you? You don't like being with other people, huh? You only want to be with me. Miss! Miss, that dog ruins all the flowers! How many times do I have to tell you? That's not a dog, it's a beast! How can you keep such a dog? It's dangerous! For the children, I mean. But also for adults. How much do you think that little elephant eats? The amount of meat that beast eats in a day would last us both a week. Wow! You know, if you come to live in one of these buildings... It means you're loaded. Well, yeah... - Ulisse also has a lot of money? - Who's Ulisse? The guy the two ladies went to. - Ah, you mean the Ulisse Film! - Yes. - You just said Ulisse. - Well, I don't know. Yeah, they are all loaded in there. Serious people, of course. Right? - It's a bit chilly, isn't it? - Yeah, a bit. - The summer's over! - Yeah. It is. I... I dye them black. I'm going for coffee. You want to come too? No, thank you. Otherwise, if Miss Grazia comes down, she won't... Don't worry, she won't leave that house. - I mean, for a while. - But if she does... - I should stay here. - From there, we can see if she comes out. If you insist, then let's go. An elegant woman... Is pale in summer. And tanned... In winter. Women... An eternal mystery! Mystery... They've already started making out! What are you doing? And you're wearing my mum's kimono. Where's Nuccia? You started playing the poet and she went to get dressed. Nuccia! Nuccia! Where are you, Nuccia? Let's throw ourselves into the whirlpool too. Let's dance! Let me go, please! - Please! - Come on, don't be nervous! On certain occasions, one must be cheerful. Okay, enough! Oh, damn it... Guys! - I don't like this. She's being stupid! - Let's go. I don't like this. I said that... - Please, what's going on? - She doesn't want to dance. - That's not true! - It is! - I'll take care of it! - We should go. - We still have to finish the audition. - Right. - The director will tell us when to leave. - Exactly. Just a few more minutes. I'll talk to my friend and then... - Roberto, I need to talk to you. - He needs to talk to me. Tell me... What do they want from us? Nothing, don't worry. It's a good sign they asked us to stay, isn't it? Idiot, you're ruining everything! - Whiskey makes you crazy! - What? If you act like that, they'll run away. Now go over there and apologise. - Seriously? - Yes. - Fine. - Come on! Nuccia! Let's make up. I apologize, okay? - She doesn't want to forgive me. - Forgive him! - Come on! - All right, let's make up. Hurray! Now we should have a toast. How nice! Let's toast! A little whiskey and a little wine. - There we go. - To us first. - My God! - And now... We have to drink it all in one go because it's good luck. - Really? - Yes. - Cheers. - I hope it doesn't get me drunk. Whiskey! - Don't choke, little flower. - Pay attention now, Ladies. This is important. You're both going to be in our film! - I'm so happy! - And you? Aren't you happy? Thank you. - Thank you. - Who's going to play the lead? - You. - You... You'll be the lead character's friend. A very important role. - I'm so happy! - Let's put on some music. - Shouldn't we sign the contracts now? - No. - Let's dance now. - The producer is coming tomorrow. Let's not think about work right now, let's have fun. Come on! The lead character's friend. Let's get crazy! My Nuccia... Aren't you happy? I'm going to make you very famous. Easy! If you do that, I'll stop dancing. Please, don't be silly. Look at Grazia! Grazia is Grazia, I am me. Oh, my Grazia, let us indulge in voluptuousness and intoxication. - Voluptuousness? - Admit you want it. What are you talking about? Remember that I've assigned you the leading role. That's true. Why do you act like that? You know I like you a lot? - You know I'm falling in love with you? - You are, huh? Yes. Aren't you going to answer the phone? Let it ring. It might be the producer, so go answer it. I'll only go if you come with me. Fine, let's go. See? Those two are going to get it on. When you become famous one day... - Will you still look at me? Tell me. - Listen to yourself! - You know I like you a lot? - You need to answer. Hello? - You're so beautiful! - Answer it! Hello? Is that you, Bob? Nothing. I wanted to see how your conquests are going. Everything's fine, Commander. Exactly as we predicted. Hey, give me a hug! Yes? Then I can only congratulate you. Yes, don't worry, the 10,000 lire are yours. Have fun! What? No, I... I'm with a group of South American guys. We're going dancing at La Cabala tonight. One of them is a phenomenon at dancing the cha cha cha. Bye. And... Say hello to Fabrizio. Bye. One stall ticket. - 600. - Okay. Thank you. THE JAMES DEAN STORY - You boor! - Calm down! Don't shout! You can't say no to me. - Get off of me! - Shut up! Who the hell is it? Are you crazy? Hello? Is that you, Bob? There is an exceptional movement here. Enrichetto and Giampaolo have spotted two high class chicks. What do you want to do? We could organize a chic little something. What? - What did he say? - Vulgarities, as usual. Nuccia! Nuccia! Where are you? Why don't you answer? Nuccia! Where are you, Nuccia? Nuccia, why don't you answer me? Nuccia! Is this a joke? Fabrizio! Grazia! Nuccia! Come on, get out! Stop playing! Hey! What do you want? Go away! Where is Nuccia? What do I care about Nuccia? Scram! This way, he can't disturb us anymore. And me and my little Chinese girl... Can sit here quietly and in love. Oh, you got the hiccups! - My poor love! - I always get... - My little Chinese girl has the hiccups. - I always get the hiccups... When I drink. Always. God, I don't feel good. I feel like dying. - I feel dizzy. - Look at that! Look up there, there's a bird flying. Look, the little bird. There's no birdie. I don't feel good. I got you! Come on, get out of there. You're not gonna get away with this. Did you lock yourself in? Nuccia! Open the door. Please! Nuccia, be good. Open the door! Please! You're not gonna get away with this. Open the door! Open the door! I said open the door! Nuccia! Open the door, you idiot! I'll break the door down! Please, be good. Let me go home, please! If I can get my hands on you... I'll destroy you! Open the door, damn you! Open the door! Stop! - Please, stop! - Then open the door. Or I'll break it down! I'll smash everything! If you don't stop, I'll jump out the window! Hey! What's going on here? Is there an earthquake? I bet she doesn't play along! I wonder how you treated her. Damn her! - I'll show her! - How naive you are! You look like my father when he has a crush on his secretaries. I really don't care about your father. Go back to your ugly girlfriend. She's resting after one round and another. It was easy for me. Yeah. Look, you want me to try it with Nuccia? Mind your own business! Don't freak out. I'm just trying to help you. I don't want to give in to her. If I can get her out of there, I'll destroy her. You're not good at this. Look at me. Different class. I got a girl in the other room waiting for me with open arms. Bye, lover boy. No, Grazia, not like that. Please, my love! My love. That's it, very good. Please, Grazia! This way you destroy me. Yes, yes. Damn you! And how did you meet this girl? Well, I met her... In a kind of romantic way. Yeah. I saw her every morning at the tram stop... And was immediately struck by her composure. Got it. You approached her on the tram. No, because she was on the one going towards Cinecittà, while I was on the one going towards the city centre. You know the stops are opposite each other. On opposite platforms. And so it was for almost more than a year. And then what? Then one morning... While I was watching her reading... A boy approached her... One of those who are used to bothering girls... And he started behaving unkindly towards her, and he didn't even know her. What did he say? I couldn't hear because they were far away from me. - Oh, on the opposite platform. - Yeah, on the opposite stop. But I could see that she was very annoyed by him. So I had the impulse to go and help her, you see? So I suddenly ran up to him and... You slapped him. No, no. I tripped on the tram track. If someone hadn't helped me, the tram would have run me over. How clumsy of me! I must say that on that occasion, Miss Grazia... She was very kind to me. Yeah. I got a small cut here when I fell. And she lent me her handkerchief. But I don't see anything romantic in that. It's romantic because her handkerchief stayed with me. I washed it well and did everything I could to see her again. So I could give it back to her, until one day... - Look, sorry... - Yes. - But it's late. I'm late. - I see. - I have to close here. - Please, go ahead. - You're a good man, you know? - Thank you. - Can I give you some advice? - Please, go ahead. - Listen to me. - Yes. Go home. Stop waiting for her. You can see her another day... - What's her name? - Grazia. But... I've waited this long. I can wait longer. I'm not busy. - You don't know when she'll be finished. - Well... - They won't stay up there all night, come on. - Well, who knows... You know... You never know how some things will turn out. - It depends. - What do you mean? I'm just saying. - Tell me. - I'm just saying. - No, because if there's something... - No, nothing at all. Don't worry. - I'm not the kind of guy who... - Listen to me. Go home. Go home. Take my advice. - Why? Is there something...? - Nothing, really. You said it yourself, they're good girls. So... - You can tell me. I don't care. - Don't worry. And don't get offended. Why should I be offended? You're doing your job. Yeah. I'm doing my job. Good. You finally came out. I thought you wanted to stay in there forever. You're a cad! A fraud. I'm leaving now. And if you try to stop me, I'll smash your head in with this. Stop you? No. Don't you worry. That's not my intention. At least... Not anymore. You know... Sometimes, alcohol can play tricks on you. I'm... I'm so sorry. Do you want to leave? - You don't want to wait for your friend? - I don't care about her. - I want to leave. - As you wish. I apologize. I assure you that's the first time this has happened to me. I was not in control of myself. You want to take it away? You know... It's an object that my mother... Holds dear. Holds dear. You bitch! You're such an idiot! Did you think I'd let you leave? - You coward! - Stop! Stop! This damn curtain! Nuccia! Hey! Hey! What's wrong? Wake up! Come on, say something. God! My God! She's dead. God! Nuccia! Nuccia! Nuccia, answer me! I didn't do it on purpose, Nuccia! Nuccia! She's dead. She's dead! - Hey, are you home? - Fabrizio! - Come out! - Come! - Hurry up! - Come on! - Come! - Hurry up! - Someone is... - What? Put it in neutral. We're waiting for you! Someone's calling from outside! - Who's coming? - What do they want? - Fabrizio! - Will you deign to look out? - Come on! - Look out! Shut up or you'll wake everyone up! - That's true. - We don't care. Come down! Don't flatter yourself. - Come down. - Come on! - Come on! - Come down, Fabrizio! All right, I'm coming. Even if you managed to have an orgy with the two chicks... You're still nobodies! Bob, the gang's here! Susy's with them too. I knew she would come back. I'm going down, or they'll smash everything. What's done is done, and a night like this... Must be ended in beauty. What's wrong? Nothing accomplished, right? Hi! Why did you put me in Chinese clothes? Where's Nuccia? I'm talking to you. Where's Nuccia? Nuccia... Is in the other room. Is she getting ready? Yeah. Sure. Yes. What's wrong? You're weird. Nothing. I just drank too much. You're telling me. My head is still spinning. Well... I'm gonna get dressed, okay? I'm gonna get dressed. Here we are. - Here we go. - We are here. Where is the second champion? We're ready for the party. Do you like the surprise? - Take this off. - We're all thirsty. Girl, get ready to get huddled together. Music! That is some great calypso music. Why don't you introduce us to the host? He's so cute! - So we can thank him. - For what? - I bet it was your idea. - You win. We found her coming out of the theater all alone with ten sailors on her tail. We saved her. And she told us you were partying here. Yeah? Well done. Yeah. I had a debt to pay off. - No, you can't go in there. - Why? - You just can't. - Oh, you're so annoying. What's the big deal? It's not my first time here. Full speed ahead. I was afraid you were angry with me. Me? Angry? Oh, please. - Come here and let's dance. - Ready! On track! Bob! Why are you so quiet? Are you annoyed by this invasion? Oh, look who's here! Who's that girl? Guys, she's hot! Fabrizio! Where have you been hiding her? Wow! You've finally decided to show people your conquests. Luigi, this is Grazia. I don't know her surname. And they are boys who came here to have fun. What about you, Bob? Won't you show us your conquest? Yes. Susy... What? Are you afraid that they will make fun of you? Nuccia is... Nuccia is dead. - Dead? - I swear. It was me, it's my fault. It's my fault. - Hey, let's play the game of truth. - All right. Susy, come here. It's time for the game of truth. No, I don't want to play. You guys play. Bob, what about you? - Come on, Bob. - He doesn't want to play either. He doesn't feel well. Poor baby, he doesn't feel well. How fragile you are! Forget it, they're afraid their secrets will be found out. - Who asks the questions? - Me. - Him. - All right, you ask. -Just be ruthless, okay? - She's in here, isn't she? Yes. Come on, open the door. What if they see her? - Rirì, have you ever tried coke? - Him? He only drinks coke. Giampaolo, which girl emptied your wallet the most? Your cousin Patrizia. Every time I take her out, she drinks half a bottle of whiskey. Has she given herself to you at least? - No way. She already has a man. - Of course she has, I'm not a woman. Who knows? Fabrizio, now it's your turn. - We'll lock the door. - The other day, Susy went off on her own... Come on. I'm not jealous, come on! Did you know that your sister is having an affair with the Filipino consul? Damn you! Who told you that? Holy Mother of God! How did it happen? She's really dead. My God! What do I do now? I'm ruined, my God! She's breathing! She's breathing! Is she alive? She's not dead? She's only fainted. Quick, get something... Some vinegar! Okay. Don't just stand there, hurry! - Come on! - Okay, okay. I don't really care. So what you're saying is... If Susy cheats on you, you... How do I explain this to you? I don't give a shit about Susy. - God, you crack me up! - Fabrizio, you're hilarious! What's wrong with Bob? He looks so mysterious. Tonight he is a bit dumb, and Susy is dumber than him. They must be suffering from serious spiritual crises. - Enough! Let's continue the game. - All right. Go on! Do you know what "spiritual problem" means? - Come on! - Meh... -Meh meh, that's the sound of the sheep. - And the wolf eats the sheep. How are you feeling? Bad. - Where is that scoundrel? - He is desperate, you know? He came to call me looking so crazy... That I thought something bad had happened. But luckily... - Lie down, you'll be more comfortable. - No, I want to leave. - I want to get out of here and report him. - What? - Yes, I will report him. - But... Why? After all, nothing happened. Nothing serious, I mean. You're afraid... Of a scandal, aren't you? I'm not. I said that because... Wait. I thought that... You're gonna need some money to get back home. Here. You might need it. Come on, it's all right, take it. So what are you gonna do? Turn him in? No. Don't worry. I'm not gonna turn him in. Because I pity him. And I pity you too. A lot. - How many times have you stolen? - Never stolen. - Would you kill your mother or father first? - Neither. Guys, wait. Deaths aside, I have another bad question to ask. Go on. Listen... How many in your family? - Five. - And... Do you have a bathtub? Yes. And do you wash every day? Because you smell like a dumped person. You know that? She's so stupid, she hasn't figured it out yet. No wonder you managed to fool her, she's a bit of a moron. You're right, she's got her head in the clouds. Wake up! You're making me look bad. Come to my house tomorrow, I'll make you sign a nice contract. She is really stupid. Stop! What do you think? Why are you making fun of me? - Let's go. - See you around. So? What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? Now that those two boors are gone... We have to toast. Because there are only classy people left here. - Pour me a glass. - Come on guys, everybody drink with me. Come on guys, cheer up! Pour me another glass. Nuccia. Promise me you'll go home. Yes. Thanks. Thanks for waiting for me. If we don't hurry, we'll miss the last tram. Sorry, my shoes are a bit noisy. But tomorrow I'll get them wet, so... - Did they leave? - Yes. She scared the hell out of me. How did Nuccia feel? How do you think she felt? Not well, of course. No. You know what she said? That she pities us. Think how strange it is to hear that from a girl like her. I think she's right. Your life... Mine... Fabrizio's, our friends'... They're useless lives. We don't do anything real. Nuccia is right: we are pitiful. Don't start whining now. You're always the same. You have fun and then you have a breakdown. You know she wanted to report you? Don't worry. I convinced her not to. I gave her money. The money from the bet I won. And she took it. Poor Nuccia. Why did you do that? Why did you tell me on the phone you were going dancing? You were going to the movies, alone. It's so beautiful to kiss you. I would kiss you all my life. Susy... I love you. I always did. What's wrong? Are you crying? I said I love you. Are you thinking about Fabrizio? He doesn't deserve you. You know what he said before? That he doesn't care about you. - He told everyone, and they laughed. - I can't. I just can't. - What's wrong with you? - Don't you get it? You say you love me, but it's too late. You are just like Fabrizio. You are... You are incapable of loving. You just can't, and today you proved it. Susy! Susy! Bob, we're bored so we're leaving. Bye. You see, darling... This is Bob, my best friend. But he's got one little problem. He's not very good with women. Isn't that right? He's the champion of not being able to get a woman. Yvonne, give him a kiss. He's the host, it's not fair that he doesn't get a kiss tonight. - Is it, guys? - Come on, give him a kiss. - Yvonne, make him dream. - Sure. With pleasure. She won't bite you! She's only a woman. - Come on! - Come on, kiss each other! - Hey, what's wrong with you? - Did you see that? - He's afraid to kiss a woman. - Stop it! You didn't get anything tonight, huh? And you're angry. You tried every which way but... No dice. I told you to stop it! Oh, you're hurt now. Of course you are. While all your buddies were having fun with these dolls, you were off playing peeping tom. - Unbelievable! Bye, Bob. - Bye, loser. - Bye, bye. - I can't dance because I'm wearing short socks. Bye, loser! I'll keep count. My love! Bye, loser! Rest easy! - Bye, loser! - Bye. If I am a loser, you... Fabrizio Conaldo, have been cuckolded. I kissed Susy, your girlfriend, the girl who's in love with you. Since you say I'm a loser, are you happy now to hear this? Laugh now! You and that mass of morons who are with you. If you have the guts, come down and tell me to my face what you just said. Fine. I'm coming. He insulted everyone. Remember that. Don't worry. - What's going on? - They're going to kill each other. - Stop it! What do you want to do? - What do you think, stupid? I repeat and confirm everything I said. Fine. You'll never get my lizards... Johnson. These offenses... Must be washed in blood. Defend yourself, Slim! They are nuts! You got me, bastard! Give me a machine gun. I got hurt for real! Here I am, Slim! Hold him still! Scoundrel! - Charge! - Come on, guys, run! I can't run in heels! - Come on, start the engine! - Hurry up! Come on! - Come on, Susy! - Come on! - Let's go play a trick on Giorgio Carlo. - Come on, Susy! - We'll give him a surprise movement. - Come with us! - Don't be so dramatic! - Give it up. Kiss me, baby!
