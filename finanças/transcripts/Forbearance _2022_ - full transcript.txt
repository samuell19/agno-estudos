[light piano music] [Bo] Do you remember the first time we came here, bud? Yeah, how can I forget that, man? You were trying to set your bait. Actually, my dad, he was helping you. - Yeah. - And, uh, you started casting it right when he was setting it. Yeah, the hook went right through his thumb. [laugh] Man, I'm glad it was you and not me 'cause I had to live with the man. But I got that look. You know that look? Yeah, but you got to go home that night. You didn't have to stay with him. That was like, thank you. He didn't want to take me fishing for a while after that. - Oh, man, I miss him. - We need to get out of here - a little more, you know? - Yeah, it's nice. Yeah. It's just so frustrating, I mean, I go back and forth, back and forth. Well, Callie, have you made up your mind? Yeah. And? Today's the day. Okay. [class chattering] Hey, guys, I need you to start settling down. It's time to do some reviews from the last few weeks. [chuckling] It's okay, it's all right, guys, I got it, thank you. Wow! There's a way to start the day! Go ahead and pull out your textbooks. [bell ringing] Okay, guys, hey, don't forget we have a test tomorrow. It's gonna cover the last two weeks, so that's correlations, linear transformations and binomial probabilities, yeah? All right, have a good weekend, we'll see you tomorrow 'cause it's not the weekend, so, study hard. Taylor, why are you still here? I wanted to know what was on the test, Miss Sun bury. Go home, Taylor. So, how are things going for you? It's been what? Two weeks now? - Three. - Mm-hmm. - I miss home. - Yeah. - Cincinnati, right? - Yeah. Well, you'll get used to it, you know. Small towns run at a slower pace but it'll grow on you. Don't forget to study. Callie, so glad I caught you. This is for you. It's just a reminder for when you need it. You got this. Hello, ladies. - Hey, Mr. Arner. - Mr. Arner. - Will you call me later? - Yes, I'll call you. Okay. Okay. Once again. Uh, knock it off, guys! Who started this? [woman] No need to sit there. This won't be long. You're sure? Because this is a big step, not really an iffy thing to do. You're in or you're out. That's everything, give it to him. Don't let him say anything, give it and go. Get a drink, go to the zoo, adopt a cat, whatever, but, don't give him a foothold. - What if he wants to talk? - Deliver the blow. Let it settle. The time for discussion isn't then. Emotions aren't logic and emotional people aren't logical. Miss Sun bury, my job isn't to be nice, it's to get you what you deserve. This will only get more difficult from here and I can only take you as far as you're willing to be taken. Yeah? So. It's official then. This is you asking him to do this mutually. If he agrees, the whole thing is much easier. If not... Okay. Thanks, Winona. Hey. - What's that? - What's what? Thought you just put something in there. Like what? I don't know. Well. Okay, then. You didn't have anything? Don't talk to me like I'm a dog. Don't act like a wounded puppy then. I don't understand why you can't believe me. Because you're acting all defensive. Why do you always come in here and start things? Just tell me you didn't have anything. I didn't have anything, Josh. [coughs] I just was looking at that VHS tape that used to have our wedding on it. Now it's got the Reds being swept by the Phillies. I have said sorry who knows how many times. That's right, I forgot, that gets all those memories right back on that tape for me. Thank you. [coughs] Why'd you get home so late? Parent-teacher conference. On a Tuesday? There's school on Tuesdays. Hey, you don't need to take a tone. I don't have a tone. Don't talk to me like I'm a kid. You know a lot about kids, don't you? Don't start with me. You know, you're the one who came in here acting all suspicious and getting ugly with me. [coughs] So you were at school? Yeah. - Just asking. - No, you're not. - You're digging. - Don't tell me what I'm doing. I believe you were at school. Seems like that's all you do anymore. Well, what's that supposed to mean? You know what it means. Yeah, I do. That means I'm not around here to pick up after you. - I have work. - So do I! You sit at a desk, reading papers, not that hard, Callie. It is what it is, I'm not trying to complain, but... Really? Seems like that's all you ever do. You used to be home more. Well, I used to have a reason to be home and now I've got a reason not to be. Oh. So you need a reason to be here. Got it. You're right, Josh. Just is what it is. [Josh] What's for dinner? It's getting late. - What are we having? - Vegetable rice. Again? You know I hate that. [Callie] Well, you didn't go to the store. I had work today. Oh, that's right. I just sat at a desk all day reading papers. - I didn't say that. - You did. I did earlier, yeah, but not about this. Well, it may as well have been about this. But it wasn't and you know that... If you want something else, you can make your own damn dinner. - That's not my job. - There it is! Hey, babe. [Jonah] Hi, please don't call me that. Fine. How about "sweetie"? [Jonah] No. Little Jojo? [Jonah] Mom. Honey? [Jonah] That'll work. I still like Little Jojo. [Jonah chuckles] What's up? When you coming home? [Jonah] School is pretty busy. [Callie] I know, we just... [Jonah] I want to. I want to see you. Us. We miss you. [Jonah] You miss me? We miss you. [Jonah] I miss you too, Mom. He's watching the game. [Jonah] Of course he is. He says hi. Listen, I've got observation at the hospital in the morning, so I... Of course, yes, alright. Well, good night, Little Jojo. Good night, Mom. [coughs] Hey, Cal. Gotta open up a sauna. Maybe you can use some of that money I'll get with my promotion. [Callie] That's still coming through? It's been like three years since you started talking about that. Yeah, but it will. Might mean you can quit teaching. I don't want to quit teaching. [Josh] Mm-hmm. I was thinking, you know, might be nice, maybe be a stay-at-home mom. I didn't know we wanted another. Might be nice. Look, just because you screwed up so bad with the first one, it doesn't mean we could start from square one. What are you thinking? Why would you say that to me? Be sure to read the questions carefully. [phone vibrating] Taylor, no cellphones in class ever. But during a test, I mean... [phone ringing] I really need you guys to take this seriously. Aren't you supposed to answer that? This is my classroom and I don't have to answer to you. What if something happened? Like, what if this is a big emergency? - Shut up! - [Callie] Enough! Just focus on your papers. - Callie. Miss Sun bury. - What? I'm sorry. Yes? [Victoria] You are... It's Josh. What's going on? [Josh] Dr. Ross, he'll have to tell us that. What happened? I was at work and then I was here. Bill was with me whenever I woke up he said I collapsed. He just left a little bit ago. Does anybody know? Anything, any ideas? Is it your heart? - Cal. - What? If it was my heart, you think I'd be in a bed somewhere not out here sitting in this uncomfortable chair? [coughs] Victoria's covering my class. Oh, great. Something else she can blame me for. Are you serious? She will, you know she will. You are so pathetic sometimes, it's unbelievable. Everything's going extremely well, Kathy. I would like to see you in two weeks, though. Make an appointment on the way out. Thank you, Dr. Ross. My pleasure, sweetheart. Josh and Callie. Sorry for keeping you waiting. Would you like to come in? [coughs] I'll tell you what. Josh, answer a question for me. How long have you been coughing? I don't know. A couple of months. And you didn't think it important to come and see me? I thought it was allergies. In all the time I have known you, you have never suffered from seasonal allergies. [coughs] Yeah, I thought something on the farm might have... No, don't think I'm stupid. How long have you been coughing up blood? It's been last month or so. Well, from the reaction of Callie, I'd say that she didn't know. I assume that working on the farm there's a great deal of airborne pollutants. Yeah, I wouldn't know anything about that. Let's just assume that I'm correct. Now, based on the x-rays, CT scans, we've discovered that you have major lesions on your chest and on your lungs. That and the fact that you're coughing up blood leads me to one conclusion. This is incredibly hard for me, Josh. I've known you two since you were kids, you're part of my family. You have cancer. You have lung cancer. I think that, with the progression of this cancer, it's stage four, maybe stage three. But more likely stage four. Treatments, though, it would go away? I could recommend a lot of treatments, and, no, it will never go away. However, at this stage, with the aggression of this cancer, the treatment would be worse than the disease. Now, I feel that you've probably got three to six months. [sobs] Most probably only three. Now, what I would suggest is that you get all of your personal things sorted out. That door will always be open to you. This office will always be open to you no matter what. You come, you see me, I'll do anything I can. Come and see me. I'm so sorry for both of you. [Callie] I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Crops aren't growing well. They'll be fine. I didn't say it wouldn't be fine. Crops are fine, Cal, just lower yields, that's all. Soil's bad. The soil is bad? It's too acidic. For some reason, it's getting worse every year. - How do you know? - I test it. You? Dad taught me. Well, I did not know that. Well, you don't teach chemistry for a reason, Cal. You don't farm this land anymore for a reason, Josh. We agreed. That was the both of us, me and you. Bo would farm it and we'd split the profits. We agreed on that. The second that happened, the soil went bad, according to you anyway. All I know is things stop growing. I'm sorry. It's fine. It's not fine. What are we gonna do? When are we gonna tell him? He won't care. How can you say that? 'Cause it's the truth, Cal. We both know you're gonna tell him. I'm not saying a word to anybody. Like Victoria doesn't know already. I bet you called her... She told me at school, Josh. Yeah, because you can't wait to air out our dirty laundry for the whole world to see. Wow, you really don't trust me. I trust you. - Just everyone else that... - Bull. We both know you don't trust me. Would you have called me? Would you have contacted the school or would you just let me come home to find out? Of course I would have called. See, now I don't believe you. This isn't... What? Josh, this isn't what? This isn't about you. [indistinct chatter] What are we having? Meatloaf. Mashed potatoes, your favorite. Don't want that. We need groceries. I'll go tomorrow. [Josh] Couldn't go today? We're back to this? What the hell does that mean? Hello, you gonna answer me? This is dinner. Take it or leave it. [coughs] Do you need another pill? Don't do that. Do what? Take care of me. What am I supposed to do then? So, you know it's been a week. Are we gonna talk about this or...? Why? Why would you refuse treatment? - Why would you do that to me? - I don't want it. Why? If there is even a chance that you could... - There's not. - There is. You heard Dr. Ross. Chemo is not going to make a difference. - 7% greater chance... - Of what, Cal? Me lying in a bed somewhere medicated out of my mind? No! No. [coughs] Anything good? Junks. There it is. Severance check. [coughs] 40 hours a week for 18 years. In the end, got 1,000 bucks and lung cancer. Always said that this job would be the death of me. Don't put this on me. Just joking, Cal. Although, I did get this job to pay for you and Jonah. There it is. It's not like I wanted to be there my whole life. You could have quit, could have gone anywhere. I was getting a promotion. Josh, why would they promote you? I'm gonna be in the barn the rest of the afternoon. Try to get that motorcycle running. Why? Because I want to. Because you want to. [phone ringing] [phone vibrating] - [Bo] Josh. - Yep. Hey, don't sound so excited. You free tonight? Or the wife got you chained up? Alright. [people chattering] [laughs] Josh! My man. - Sit. - Yeah. Good seeing you. What the hell is she doing here? Who? Lacy? I don't know, I don't know why she's back here. Well, man. No, no. Wait, wait. It's ancient history like Mayans, Pilgrims and shit. Honestly, I don't think she remembers. She remembers. Hey, Lacy, could we get a beer over here for my friend, please? Laugh it up. Thank you. Did you notice on the south side of the property there's like a kind of...? Yeah, you know what? It will be a lower yield, that's all. Don't worry about it. You catch that Reds' game last night? Yeah, talking about a suck game. Hey, pathetic. Damn disaster. Hey, I think our high school team could have beat them. [laughs] Yeah, right. Hey, Lace, let me get a bit of Tom Smith bourbon, please. Make it three on me. - Thank you, sir. - What are we celebrating? You can always celebrate something as long as it's not the Reds winning. Pathetic. Yeah. He gets a napkin. You know I'm not getting one. - Thank you, sir. - It's good stuff. Thank you. You look terrible, man. Love you too, man. [laugh] Ah, hell. What happened to us, man? Kids. Not me. No, divorce did it for you. No, are you kidding me? The prettiest day of my life. That right there? That says more about your life than anything, Bo. You know what? I'm fine with that. But you, you are just as whipped as ever, man. Hmm. Okay. It's okay. She ain't here. You know? Lacy, she's not a pastor anymore, so we can say anything we want. She can't even tell God anymore. It's not God that I'm worried about, you know that. It's true. I wouldn't put it past Cal to have spies around here. Under there? [laughs] Fine. I get it. I respect it. When you get someone that hot, you just lock that down and chain it up and put locks on it, throw the key away. Then do whatever they tell you. Shut the hell up. I'm just joking, man. Come on, can't take a joke? Sad. You know what? Maybe I don't want you talking about my wife like that. See? That's the shit I'm talking about. Whipped. [whipping sounds] You know what? You can cash me out. I'm out. Oh, hey, dude, dude. Josh, I'm kidding. I'm joking. Come here. Josh. I'm busting your chops, man. I'm kidding. I'm sorry. No more jokes left, all right? Next round's on me. Hey, Lace, could you set us up again here, please. Don't you think you've had enough? I can always have more. Does that line ever work for you, Bo? How you doing? Come on, man! I was pathetic. Yeah. Sorry. I'm fun. Yeah, you're something, alright. That's right. [rock music playing] How can you stand it, man? I don't know, it's not all bad. Callie, she gets stuff done around the house and helps out where she can. And she gives you permission to come hang out with me, - your buddy. - Hey. I don't need to get permission. Oh. Okay. So, she knows you're out here with me tonight, right? No. [laughs] It's okay. It's been difficult the past few weeks. Every day of marriage is difficult. That's why I got out of it. Speaking of which, you still, you know, getting some? Dude. Are you happy, Josh? Marriage isn't about happiness. No, it's about saying shit like that and making it makes sense. [laughs] Hey, Lace, set us up with another round here. And crank some tunes, please. You must be very confused. I am not here for your entertainment. Oh, wanna be? Not in your wildest dreams. [laughing] Come on, man. What? It's not like I asked her to get up and dance on the bar or something. Come on, man. Lighten up. What? It's Callie Sun bury. Yes, right. Hi. What? How'd it go? Um, well, I was wondering if there was a way that we could maybe make a different arrangement. Things have changed a little bit since... Things have changed. Right, of course. He brought home flowers, made dinner, what? He has cancer. Lung cancer. A couple of months at the most. I see. So I don't know when or really if, I mean... You never gave him the notice? Well I didn't really get a chance. Are you sure he didn't find them? He could be faking the cancer thing. People will do wild things. I just, it's my job to make sure. [groans] How long does he have? Three months at the most. And if he miraculously starts getting better, what then? Well, then I guess we'll revisit. Oh, okay. Are you asking for a suspension of the retainer? Whatever we can arrange. You know we already had an arrangement, but if... My husband is dying. I would encourage you to work husband out of your vocabulary. That won't make this any easier. Well, he's still my husband. Yes, something you have asked me to change. I need you to listen to me. I am not his advocate. I am yours. So, while I have sympathy for him, I am concerned with protecting you, Miss Sun bury, your assets. Hello? Alright. I get this, you got next round. Although I am seeing triple right now. It helps. Close one eye, here we go. That's it. It's not the ball you were aiming at. We're not playing slob. We're not playing slob. - I'll give you that. - Alright. Okay. Watch this. Mm-hmm. - Oh, come on. - Watch. Don't hurt yourself. Hurt myself? I'm an expert. I got this. - No way. - Yeah. Dude. I told you, man. No way you hit that sober. No way. That's why I like playing drunk. We've really spent the past 20 years at this bar. You say it like it's a bad thing. It's over half my life, Bo. Yeah, but you got to spend it with me, your buddy, your pal. It's true. We come here what? Twice a week? Mm-hmm. Oh, except for last week when you douched me. That's not bad, twice a week. There's like, I don't know, 50 something weeks in a year. That's, uh, that's a lot. Yeah. Exactly, Einstein. But, hey, beats being at home with the wife, right? You don't got a wife. Yeah, yeah, I know. Yeah. Your shot. You ever think about what you would do if I was gone? You know, if I died? What, do you plan on doing that anytime soon? Just answer the question. I, I... I don't know. I'd be sad. Miss you, I guess. I... I'd keep farming your land, make sure Callie gets that money, right? Yeah. I mean, why the hell are we talking about this? This is a freaking buzz killer, man. Let's just shot some stick. Jesus. The hell. [laughing] That's funny. That sucked. Alright. So, what do I do? Tell you what. We'll suspend for now, the papers will stay active. If you need me, I'm here, just... I know this is sad and you don't want to look like a terrible person, but be careful. Things like this can change a person, but whether it's for the better or worse, who knows? Okay. Good girl. We'll figure this out, take care of yourself. Remember, you first Miss Sun bury, you. Okay. If I didn't say it, I'm sorry this is happening. It's fine. Josh? Josh? Jonah! This light has always not worked. What are you doing here? Oh, hi. Victoria. I wish she hadn't done that. I was going to tell you. When? Before the funeral or after? Sorry, it was uncalled for. Stage four large cell lung carcinoma? I assume the doctor told you the survival rates. Statistics don't tell the whole story. Dad didn't want you to tell me, did he? This isn't about you. - I'm sorry, but it's not. - Yeah. - It's about him. - Yeah, you're right. Can't imagine how hard this has been on you. Oh, I'm fine, don't worry about me. I always worry about you. Well, don't. I want you to worry about school or girls or anything but me. Deal, as long as you don't worry about me in return. Oh, no, see? I'm your mom, it's in the job description. [laugh] [sighs] Things aren't any better, are they? I'm gonna take this to your room. Mom. Mom. I came home for you, not him. I think you need to patch things up. - Fine, him first. - Jonah. You are a man. He's been a man this whole time. Why...? Hey, do you have any leftovers, I'm starving. I have meatloaf. Jonah... I told you, man, back in high school, if... if you didn't strap that up, I was gonna. Do you have any idea how many guys you crushed when you told us that Callie was pregnant, man? Tons. Man, she was always too good for you. Way above your property value. I thought you hated Callie. No, I didn't. I'd put up with that if, you know... - Oh, hey, come on. - Are you kidding me? I loved Callie. I'd love to have... Hey, guys, knock it off. The hell, Josh! I don't want Callie, I want what you had with Callie. When you first started out, it was so good, it was pristine, I didn't have that with Vic. My life was hell for years! - The hell? - I'm dying, Bo. What? I'm dying, Bo. - I'm sorry, man. - Wait, what? I should have told you. Just too stubborn, I guess. Stage four cancer. [coughs] No, no, no, no, they have... they have treatments now. The doctors, they fix stuff like this now. No! Shut up. Hey, just listen to me for once, alright? I'm dying and there's nothing I can do about it, okay? I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, no. I'm gonna get us another round. [coughs] No! [Josh] Bo, come on, man! Crops aren't growing well. They'll be fine. I didn't say it wouldn't be fine. - Soil's bad. - Too acidic? It's been going that way. How do you know? Destiny's roommate studies agricultural management. I get to hear about it every time I'm over. Destiny? Jonah Sun bury, who is Destiny? - I told you. - No. - Playing pickup. - She's cute. You don't like basketball. It depends on who's playing. Oh. [laughs] So, how long have you been...? We aren't, technically, - but two months or so. - [phone ringing] I think that's great. It sounds really great. Hang on. Hey. What? What? We need to go pick up your dad. Thanks for calling. Sorry for the trouble. [Lacy] Yeah, not at all. Can you walk? What do you want? Hmm? What are you doing here? Nothing. No reason. Why, something going on? I told you not to tell him! - She didn't tell me. - I didn't tell him! I also said not to tell her. It's a big secret to keep, Josh. It's hard enough as it is. And yet neither of you told me. Hell, we didn't have to. Not with Victoria being the town crier. - Josh, enough! - Why wouldn't you want me to know? It's not... Maybe if you come home a little more often. I'm home right now. Cincinnati's not that far away, you could have been here if you tried. Why? Why? So you could yell at me again? Oh! So, this is what it takes? Your old man getting cancer and find out he's going to die? That's not fair. I suppose you're gonna get on me about going to the bar too, right? I'm not gonna say it was the most responsible thing you could do, no. Like a 21-year-old has a right to lecture me on responsibility. Right, sorry, should I have a five-year-old by now? Would that make me more responsible? Get out. - Jonah, don't... - I said get out! Just stay. He'll calm down and I'll... Go up to your room and... Josh? - Josh! - Hey, call 911. Call 911! Hey, Dad, Dad, come on. Lean back, lean back, lean back. Pull this back. Deep breaths. Deep breaths. [Callie] Yes, Hello. I need an ambulance at 5523 Harrison Road, please. It's my husband, he's short of breath and, um, I don't know, it could be a heart attack. He's, um, he's been drinking and he has cancer. Thank you, thank you. You're alright. It's okay. Josh, I know it's not ethical for a doctor to say I told you so, but really, right now, right here, on a scale of one to ten, tell me, how severe is that pain in your chest. Seven. [coughs] Now I know you wanted to handle this yourself and I agreed, but ibuprofen? That just doesn't cut it. And you're getting worse, no offense. You need to do the chemotherapy. No. What are... What are the percentages? Percentages, really, they don't tell you anything. It's not a science, but if you want me to guess, I would say that, possibly, by doing the chemotherapy, we could get a 12 to 17% increase. I can't guarantee it. Come on, Josh. [Dr. Ross] It's up to you, two. Up to you. - Josh! One! - Sorry. - Just one. - No. [coughs] You got plenty of gas? Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm good. We could give you some money for gas. - I'm good. I'm good. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I'm great, good. - Alright, well. You want a sandwich? I can make you a sandwich real quick. - No, I... - It takes five minutes. I ate so much, I ate so much. I could not even think about eating anymore. I'm worried I'm not going to fit in my scrubs. Have you seen scrubs, they're free-flowing. - Okay. - I'm worried about them. - Thank you. - Of course. - You drive safe, okay? - Of course. - Call me when you get there. - [Jonah] Yeah. Bye, Little Jojo. [no audible dialogue] [inaudible arguing] - This shit right here? - Yes. [coughs] [coughing] [game playing on TV] [inaudible] - I'm a grown-ass man! - Yeah, you are. [inaudible] When did you give up? Unless... it was before all of this. A long time before. Was it when... when Jonah quit baseball? Callie. You were already gone then. Me, too. [coughs] [inaudible] Josh? Josh? Josh? Bo, hey, uh, do you know where Josh is? - Bo? - [Bo] I'm here. Haven't seen or heard from him today at all, sorry. Are you being straight with me? Yeah, I mean, maybe he just needed some time away. [coughs] Well, that was supposed to be locked. So the prodigal son returns. Yeah, I don't know that story that well. I don't think he was the good guy. I suppose you think you're the good one. You know we're not open yet. [coughs] Oh, whatever. You want anything? You pick, whatever's your favorite. [coughs] Just make it strong. Oh, it's strong. Good for the bones. So, former pastor, huh? I like to think of myself more as a reformed pastor. Why'd you stop? [coughs] Oh, well, I believe, always have, always will, I think. But sometimes being a leader in that sense doesn't really allow enough room for you to ask your own questions. Or at least to get them answered. So you thought running this bar would be the next best step? [chuckle] [coughs] Well, for the most part, it's the same gig. Better dress code is all. So, how does it feel to be dying? Wow, that was blunt. Yeah, I don't have to follow that whole pastoral care standard anymore. So how'd you know? It is the worst kept secret in town. Then you also look like shit. [laughs, coughs] Victoria probably told you. No, it was that friend of yours. The handsome one? You think Bo is handsome and I look like shit? [laughs] But, you know, he is the kind of guy who would really benefit from a swift kick in the balls. You know what? I would agree to that. A toast. So answer my question. I'd rather not. Hey, I answered your way too personal a question to answer over a glass of milk question. Answer mine. [coughs] You want a different one? Why'd you give up on your marriage? What? I never gave up. You were in here a few weeks ago and it sure sounded like you did. Yeah, I didn't give up, I just... Oh, you got lazy. Yeah. All right. Why did it take finding out you were dying for you to care? I've always cared. Oh, have you? Yeah, I love her. Do you? Loving passively is as good as not loving at all. Love is a verb, Josh. I know. [coughs] Sure, now you do. It's too late. Maybe, but try, don't run. That's what I did. That... that was my sin. Don't... don't let it be yours. Yeah. I couldn't run if I wanted to. Not with these lungs. [laugh] [coughs] So, got any kids? Uh, one. Same. Nightmares aren't they? Oh, the worst, but also the best. Yeah, my boy's in college. He came home a few weeks back. He was in here that night. We've, uh... we've had a rough go of it over the years. I don't know if I have enough time to make it right to him or Callie. [coughs] Well, as the mother of a teenage girl, a very moody teenage girl, I will offer you this, don't tell them, show them. And on that note, um, I've got to finish cleaning up here and get back over to school to pick up that moody girl and be back in time to open, so, sadly, I am cutting you off. [coughs] Hey, let me help you with that. Oh, no, that's okay. - Yeah. - It's only just a few things. You let me crash your work, it's the least I can do. Alright, well, if you can manage to get those plates to the kitchen that would be great. [coughs] [phone vibrating] What's going on, handsome? Shouldn't you be at work? I just wanted to let you know the wife's looking for you. - How do you know? - She called me. Must be serious. Where are you? Thanks for the talk, Lace. - Oh, sure, anytime. - Thanks for the milk. Huh, absolutely, anytime. [coughs] [coughs] Damn it! What do we have here? Cal? Where were you? I was out. Well, you scared me to death. Sorry, I dropped it. It's fine. I got it, got it. Hey, you don't gotta do this. Do what? - That. - Helping? - Pitying. - God's sake, Josh. I'm just trying to help. Don't bring him into this. I mean, am I even worth that, Cal? What are you saying? We were young and dumb and in love. That's alright. [coughs] There's plenty of people get their start from that. You're not him. I was never meant to be a husband or a father. You are not your father. Might be worse. I failed Jonah every step of the way. I failed you every step of the way. You didn't hit me. You never hit Jonah. That's not all he did wrong. I've made his other mistakes. It was a long time ago. Yeah, and I never did do right by that. I never apologized. I'm sorry, Cal. That was a huge stupid mistake and I'm sorry. You know where Dad was when Mom died? With another woman over at Stoutsville. Of course he'd never admit it. Say he was out picking up a hydraulic filter and installing it. I knew he was lying. I'd picked up the part earlier that day and installed it already. [coughs] I stopped caring. I gave up, Cal. I was... We were young. I was younger than Jonah is right now. I mean, I had no clue what I was doing. Neither of us did. You figured it out. That's the difference. Being a... [coughs] Same sixteen-year-old kid running the bases, dreaming of being an engineer getting rid of this God forsaken farm. There's still time. You know, chemo is still an option, Josh. No, Cal. I feel it. I feel it every day. It's like watching a sunset. You know that the light is leaving, it's almost over. Just wondering if you should have got up a little earlier that day, made coffee, maybe not worked as hard. Maybe not watch the game. That could have been time that I spent with you and Jonah. Jonah goes to school an hour from here. He's been there for three years, and I haven't went to see him one time. [coughs] You went, you saw him. At least, he made something of his life. He grew up, became a better man than his father. [coughs] [coughs] [coughs] [Callie] It's my favorite spot on the whole farm. Best spot. You realize that there's been six generations of Sunburys look out over our farm from this spot? Our farm. I'm letting Bo farm it. [coughs] And it's time to let it go. Uh, Grandpa's farm, when he was running it, all the crops grew, Dad's was fine. I checked the records, they never had bad soil. What happened? [coughs] [Callie] Time changes things. People and land. Yeah, changed me, it got worse. Stop it. Josh. Yeah. You're dying. I'm losing you. And all of this, all of this frustration and anger and, I don't know, love, sometimes. It's going with you. That's horrible. Don't you dare leave me as a broken man. After all the pain you caused me, that... that... That hurt more than anything. Just... just be better. [coughs] Do you know when I knew I loved you? It was that night that we snuck into the hayloft for the first time. You remember that? Hoping your dad wouldn't catch us. [chuckles] [coughs] Are you getting hot? You wanna go lay down for a little while? Yeah, let's go in. [coughs] Eyes on your own papers. - Okay. - Hi. Miss Sun bury. They're just finishing up their tests. I trust your appointment went well. I told them you went to the dentist. - I told the office, too. - Yes, thank you. Everything okay? Josh? Uh, y'all, uh, let's get these finished up. I'll be collecting in five. Hey, hey. Hey, man. Did you get it running yet? [coughs] Well... [coughs] Brought you some tea, some honey. It's supposed to help the cough. [coughs] Yeah, well... [Josh coughs] I was doing some reading last night, man, and, uh... Wait. What? What'd you do with my buddy Bo? [laughs] Come on, man, I read. I read. I don't think Playboy counts, man. [coughs] No, I'm... I'm serious, man. I... Like, stage four is, uh, you know, there's been people that have come back and... And beat this. They... No, Bo. [coughs] I appreciate it, but... No, there's treatments, there's... there's, look, there's stuff from other countries. There's homeopathic stuff. There's... there's all these different things, I mean, other than chemo. There's all these different things. We can try and we can, you know, fight this. I understand what you're doing, but there's nothing they can do for me, man. I'm dying, man. It's too late. No, It's not too... no, it's... No, no, it's not. It's not too late, it's not. Look, we can fight this man. Look, ever since you were this big, I have never ever seen you back off from a fight. Look, I understand the marriage didn't work out. That was not your fault. That was not your fault. We could fight this. I'm here, I will help you. We'll do whatever we have to, please. Josh, please. [Josh] Come here. Come here. Please, man, I don't wanna lose you. - [Josh] I love you. - I love you too, brother. [Josh] How long have been friends? Long time. I don't wanna lose you, man. We've been friends for as long as I can remember. I'm dying, man. What I need for you to do is... [coughs] Help me with this bike. [coughs] Come on. Okay. Okay. All right, um, yeah, you know what? Yeah, let's get... Let's get it running, man, seriously, we got this. Um, yeah, um... I'm gonna work on the throttle. [coughs] We got this, man. Come on. [sobs] [engine starts] [coughs] [water running] [coughing] [water stops] [coughing] [coughing] [coughing] [bell ringing] Taylor, come see me after class. Uh, my mom's picking me up. I think you can find the time. Bill, this is a surprise. I'm sorry. Sarah made me bring over some food for you and Josh. I just thought this would be the best place to catch you. That is so sweet of her. You be sure and tell her thank you for me, would you? - Yeah, I sure will. - Thank you. Look, it's not my place, but you make sure Josh eats some of that cornbread, okay? It can't be good for him to mix cancer meds and alcohol. What... what do you mean? I saw his truck at The Goat yesterday. Pretty early too. I can't imagine the pain he's in. But, look, it's not my place to say how someone should be handling this. It's just, you know, damn shame. Well, you be sure and thanks Sarah for me, yeah? I better get back to my papers. [coughing] [coughing] [gasping] [wheezing] [bell ringing] Taylor. I'm very disappointed. I know. [Callie] Why would you cheat? I don't know. How do you conduct a hypothesis test? Give your hypothesis as a null and an alternate. Observe the data given to test it. Do the appropriate analysis and then determine whether the null hypothesis is accepted or refuted. I know it. If you know it, why did you cheat? Because I was afraid. [Lacy] Oh, sorry. Um, the office said I might find Taylor down here. Listen, we've got to go, I've got to get back... She's talking with me. I didn't want to let you down, either of you. [Callie] I'm let down. Anyone want to walk me through what's happening here? I'm Taylor's mom and I'm sure we can deal with whatever this is at home. Yes, I'm sure there'll be plenty to deal with at home. [Lacy] What? - Cheating. - What? Taylor cheated on her test. Taylor! You cheated on Miss Sunbury's test? Why would you do this? I thought you loved... Nice to know we agree that cheating is wrong. Okay. What exactly are you talking about? You know damn good and well what I'm talking about. I let you down, Miss Sun bury. Let me fix it. There's no fixing this. Well, I think there is room for a little grace, right? Yes, I mean, it was a mistake. Was it? Excuse me? - Get out. - [Taylor] Miss Sun bury. Get out. [Lacy] What is really going on? You... and Josh. No, no, I can assure you that Josh would... Don't tell me what he would or wouldn't do. - He just came to talk. - Yeah, I'm sure. And just what was it he wanted to talk with you about? You. Listen, there is no reason for you to believe me. Josh and I have broken your trust before. But, I can tell you that all he wanted to talk about was how much he doesn't deserve you. You know? I don't know you that well. And I really don't care to. But he was right, he doesn't deserve me. All right. All right, Taylor, let's just get home. Come on. - Come on, it's alright. - What's happening? Yeah. We're just gonna go. It's alright. [screaming] No! No! [coughing] [coughing] Josh? We need to talk. What's this? Well, it's, uh... You got this the day before my accident. I did. Yeah. I shouldn't be surprised. You were always waiting to go. Hmm. Jonah's gone, you just needed to leave. What? Where were you yesterday? Answer me, Josh. At the bar. Here we go. Again with Lacy Straughn? Are you kidding me? I didn't do anything! All we were doing was talking! I heard all about it! [coughing] You did. 17 years ago, Callie! Once! [coughing] You never... you never apologized. I did. I did apologize. Yesterday. 17 years. It's too late. [coughing] What in the hell did you stay with me then? For our son. He needed a mother and a father. And you know, he didn't get that! I'm trying. These past few weeks, I've been trying to make something on our wedding tape. Something special for us. [coughs] I appreciate the effort. Josh, look, I really do. Effort alone isn't gonna fix everything. I can't fix it. I can't fix it, Cal. I want to. I wish I could. I was too stubborn to fix it and I was too stubborn for the treatments and I'm running out of time to make things better. You're just scared to see your father. I've been trying to make changes. And then I come home and I find out that you're leaving me. Can you blame me? Josh, look around. Man, can you really blame me? You know? You stayed for Jonah. Stay for me, please. - You're not a child. - Please. It was so hard raising both of you at the same time. - You know, I was... - [coughing] What's the matter? Josh? What's going on? Josh? Josh? What's wrong, baby? It's okay. I got you, I got you. Slow down. Breathe, breathe. Breathe, breathe. Look at me, look at me. Honey, you're okay. I'll stay right here. I'm sorry. I signed none of the papers. You're okay. What I did... It's fine. That doesn't matter. We'll watch it... we'll watch it tonight. We will. - Watch it. - I know. Don't. Don't leave me. Please, don't leave me. Please, Josh. Please. No. Please don't go. Stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me. Stay. Stay. No. Look at me, Josh! Look at me, please, no, no. No! No! Please stay! Stay! Please! Stay, baby, stay! I'm sorry. Stay with me. Stay, stay. I got you. I got you. I got you. Stay with me, please. Yes, yes, please, hello. I need... I need some help. I need help at... I need help at, um, 5523 Harrison Road. Please, please. My husband. My husband! [crying] I'm sorry. Josh! I'm so sorry to hear about Josh. Thank you. You did all you could. He was just so stubborn. He was... He was just very cautious. I can't blame him for that. You know, a lot of what we do in the medical profession is done with hope and prayers. Yeah, if he'd listened, if he had just taken one... I... I don't really think that it would have made a difference. I had high hopes for it. I wanted it to work, but I couldn't guarantee that it would. You know, you and I both are looking for something or someone to blame, but one thing we're forgetting. It's the wonderful thing about Josh. He never gave up, never. He never gave up on you, he never gave up on his son, he never gave up on himself. And as long as he fought, you know what? He was a winner. Don't forget that. Never forget that. [Callie] What's going on out here? Hey! Hey, girl. He's been working on this since I got here three hours ago. Okay. He has no clue what he's doing. [Callie] His dad didn't have any idea either. I can hear you! I like her. You know, he almost had it working. Just needed to, uh, jiggle the fuel injection pump and it should be good to go. Did you just Google that? I like her a lot. My lady. [engine starts] Good job, Jonah. Really good. Thank you. That's great. Well, I'm going to make dinner. We're going to go to the grocery store. Come on. Oh, okay. I like her, Jonah. Me, too. What are you gonna do with this old place? I don't know. - We should head in. - Yeah, it's getting dark. [sobbing] [coughs] Hey, it's me, Cal. Obviously. There's some things that I need to say and I think it'll be easier for me to just say them like this. I know I... I'm probably sitting right beside you, but I'm gonna do my best and we can talk about it later. [coughs] I know I'm dying, Cal. I've made my peace with it. Only thing that I haven't made my peace with is leaving you. This is because I now realize how much I've failed you over the past 20 years. And Jonah. God, Jonah. I love that kid. I never told him. I've never said it to him, not once. I was way too hard on him. I'm everything that I said that I wasn't gonna be. No wonder he doesn't want to come home. [Josh coughs] Anyway, I just want you to know how sorry I am. And I'm gonna miss you. And when I'm gone, I don't know when that is, I want you to go live your life, please. [Josh coughs] And I swear if Bo tries anything, I'll come back from the dead and I'll kill him. I swear I will. I'm sure Jonah would, too, but he's gonna be a doctor, and doctors have that whole do no harm thing. Can you believe that? Our boy is gonna be a doctor. Okay. You're gonna be getting home soon. I need to wrap this up. I'm sorry I couldn't say this in person, but we can talk about it more. You're good at listening. Always have been. I love you, Cal. I'll talk to you later. [coughs] [crying] [car approaches] That'd be, uh, Victoria and Destiny. - Hey, Callie! - Hey. I brought you saltines and vegetable soup. Thank you! You're welcome. - Can you run that into town for me? - Yeah, of course. So, you're gonna do it. I am. Alright. I better get home. Okay. I'll call you, okay? - Bye, Callie. - Thank you. - Bye, guys. - Bye. I gotta take Destiny back to school. Oh, well... Oh, it was so nice to meet you. Alright, Mrs. Sun bury. You can call me Callie, please. Please. Or you can call me Mom. Oh, good. Well, thanks for that. That's good. I should be back Wednesday morning. Should be able to stay for a few weeks. Professor's pretty understanding. - I appreciate it, thank you. - Yeah. Thank you so much. Are you gonna be ok here? Of course, yeah. I'm fine. Don't worry about me. I always worry about you. I know. I'll see you soon. All right, you be safe. I love you. [Jonah] I love you too. Take care of her. [Jonah] Of course. [door knocking] Victoria. Hey, Winona. Delivery from Callie Sun bury. Shame what happened there. In what way? The whole situation. She's better off. [chuckles] Do you ever question the morality of what you do? I found that's a dangerous hobby. And don't get too cocky. I got you the house from Bo. [chuckles] And I will forever be grateful. Have a good night, Winona. Mm-hmm. - Hey. - Hey. [Bo] It's beautiful. [Callie] Yeah, I guess. God, I miss him. [laughs] Yeah. You know, he... He was always there for me. After Vic and I split, man gave me a shot. Just feel I could have done more, you know? Oh, there's nothing more to do. We all did the best we could. You look good. Yeah. I haven't had a drink in two months. That's great. Josh would be really happy you're buying the farm. But, for the life of me, I don't know how he put up with you all these years. Must be my, uh, charming personality. That's it. That's it. - Colorado, huh? - Yeah. - Good. It's nice there. - Yeah. - Be good for you. - Thanks. You know I wish you all the happiness. Thank you, me, too. Hey. Bye. [soft music playing]
