Subtitle created by - Aorion - "Turbo Kid (2015)" ^ (Run time : 01:32:44)" This is the future. The world as we know it is gone. Acid rain has left the land barren and the water toxic. Scarred by endless wars, humanity struggles to survive in the ruins of the old world. Frozen in the ever lasting nuclear winter, this is the future. This is the year 1997. TURBO KID - Yeh. - Oh yeh. - Come on! Come on! - Yeah. - Come on! - Yeh! Come on! Come on! Kid! Hey. Oh man. It's been a long time. How've you been, huh? Oof. Jee. Oh. A vicious whole bit me, right smack in the middle of my nut sack. That shit ever happened to you? Hey. What happened? Who did that? It was the rat. That rat, did that? It's was a vicious rat. Yeah. It's a god damn miracle that you're still surviving on your own. Well. How about a drink? - No, thank you. - Suit yourself. - Oh yeah! - Alright! - Oh, yeah. - Oh. - Yes, come on! - Yeah. Yes! Yes! Are you going to play nice, Mr. Bird? Huh? Are you going to play nice? Okay. Okay. - Drinks are on you. - Yeah! Still undefeated. So, what else you got? Oh. Well. For this junk, I can give you the usual. Oh. Let me give you a couple of these 2 on credit. Looks worse than ever. Well. If you feel like complaining some more, you are more than welcome to lap up whatever is on the floor. This sucks. Hey! Keep peddling, you piece of shit. Unbelievable. Or. I could always... toss this in for good measure. What the hell do you think you are doing? Huh. You can't just walk into a man's personal bubble. His- His what? A man's personal space. The arm length radius, yeah. My mother fucking comfort zone. And it's family only. Sir? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something, Heek? - Another one has gone missing. - Who? I haven't got all day, you are going to tell me who it is or I am going to beat it out of you. It's your brother. Fuck! Let's roll! - Let's go. - Yeh! Come on. Move it! Let's go! Outstanding performance. Your infamous brother would be proud. You have any last request? Try not to see this as punishment, but rather an opportunity to prove your usefulness in these difficult times. RAAHHHH! Your reign of justice is over, Turbo rider. To be a true hero, you'll have to save your girlfriend. Save me, Turbo rider. Your evil plan will fail, Dr. Robotor. I will destroy you with my turbo glove. The ultimate weapon against the robot threat. But I am not ordinary robot. I am a secret weapon! Ah-ha-ha-ha. Prepare to taste... a full turbo charge of... Um. Hey. What's that in your hand? It's a... It's-It's a comic book. What is it about? It's-It's about Turbo rider. That's rared. Are you alone? Do you have any friend? Oh. Do you want to play hide and seek? I am... - I got to go. - Wait! Before we go, I just have to take care of something. It's okay now. You don't have to worry about me anymore. I found a new friend. I'll be fine, I promise. I'm... Hm. Sir. Sir. I've-I've been thinking. I don't know. Do you think it would a better to keep looking for the water source. Instead of, you know, fighting Zeus. Are you saying we should abandon my brother. No, no, no. But, I mean. Do-Do you really think we stand a chance. Chance? Is that how you think I became a champion? A man with a good plan has already won half the battle. - So, what is the plan? - Right now. The plan is to take a piss. Who needs chance anyway. What a cheap move. And I know that was going to be you. Soon you'll have to learn how to fix it by yourself. Here you go. - Good morning. - Woh! What're you doing here? Breakfast. Wow. Where did you find all this staff. Ha. Look at all of these. It's like a museum of coolest in here. Oh. I love one of these. Hey, nice colors. Look at that dress, I love the color of that dress. It's so nice. Oh my god. - There're so many little... - Hey, hey. Don't touch that! Are you okay? Yeah. Just. You know, you stepped in my manly- bubble thing. Oh. Did I break it? No. It's-It's more of a... an arm length... comfort, radius zone. Okay? Oh, I see. - How did you find me? - Oh, it's the bracelet. Oh. Great. Well. How do you get it off? Oh, you just don't. Sit. Eat your cereal before it gets all mushy. Okay. How do I know you didn't poison this? Well. Because, friends don't poison friends. No no. Okay. We-We are not friends. Okay. I don't even know who you are. We met at the playground. Yeah. But-But you broke into my home. You-You touch my things and you you talked to dead people. And I brought you back your Turbo rider comic book. Well. Okay. You know. I thought you would want to hang out. But- You know, if you want me to go then- Wait. Okay. You can- You can stay. But-But just for a while. My name is Apple. Of course it is. What are we going to do today? I am going scavenging. Right. I love to scavenging. No-no-no... You-you. You stay here. Just don't touch anything. Well. Why can't I come? Umm. Well. Because- Because you don't have a bike. (What's that?) We- are going scavenging. Yeah. (Clap clap clap) We love scavenging. Okay. You were right! Your manly bubble is really comfortable! Okay. We need to talk. Okay. If you are coming with me, you need to follow the survival rules of the Wasteland. Okay. I love rules. Okay. Rule #1. - Always have water on you. - Water. Check. Okay. And rule 2: Always stay within the safe zone. Oh. That's clever. Thank you. Rule #3: Always have your wheels ready. Have your wheels ready. Um. Oh. Yeah ha. #4: Try avoiding people. Especial those who looked evil. Well. I'm happy you didn't avoid me. Like I had a choice. For you're Fredric, the arm wrestler. You have an eye for the obvious, Zeus You know. It's wonderful to finally put a face to the name And an honor to have you here. You can shove that honor up your ass. Now. What the hell have you done with my brother. Patience, my good man. Patience. Now. Your way of settling things, I find a bit tedious. Around here we like to do things with a little more "Joie de vivre". (Enjoyment of life) Blades. That's a nice touch. And there's more. Blades and fire! Ha. When I say blades and fire, I want blades and fire! Do you mind? No, go ahead. Thank you. Yes. Just because civilization is over doesn't mean we can't act civilized. Well. What do you say we see what the man has to offer, huh? Alright, Zeus. But you won't like what you see. You think I didn't see that coming? I have eyes everywhere. From where I stand, I only see one. Awww! Mother fucker! I'm gonna kill you with my bare hands. Well. From where I stand, I only see one. Rule #5: No hugging while riding. Sorry. Okay. Now, we really need to find you a bike. Maybe a helmet. - Rule #5. - 6. - Rule #6 - Yes. Always carry a weapon. And... 7. If you don't have one, make one. Make one. Making a weapon. Ah. This is so pretty. This is my weapon. This is my gnome stick! Aww! Aw. I really like it a lot. Thank you so much. Pww! Poot, poot. 2 in the eye now, pervert. Boom! Power gnome! Poom! Ka-Bam! Poof. No, I told you. Get back here. Don't you ever rest? No. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. What are you doing here? I'm practicing my swing. I mean how did you get here? This side of the Wasteland. Well. My last best friend was a water hunter. So. I tagged along. Then he died and... here we are. I'm sorry. Why? What'd you do? No. I mean-I mean about your friend. Oh no, don't be. He's dead. - So. Where did you come from? - Pretty far. All the way from the other side of the Wasteland. I always wonder what the other side look like. It's kind of Grey. And dusty. Well. I could show you. I-I can't Oh yeah. Rule #2. (Always stay within the safe zone) Well, that's too bad. It's too bad because YOU'RE IT! - Ha! - What? You're it, I tagged you. Now you got to tag me back. If you can! Come on! - Oh. Look, it's a bird. - What? Now. You're freaking fast. Want to see something cool? I always want to see something cool. Come here. Ah. Whoa. That's a T-Rex. Yeah. There're these... big creatures that used to walk here a long time ago. And they got killed by this big explosion. That is kind of what happened to us. Right? Run! Run! Run! Aww! As you may know. The situation is critical. Our defense has been breached. We have reached maximum casualty level. This is it, soldier. We have to rid these damn machines with everything we got. You are our last hope. Turbo rider. The fate of our future is in your hand. Eah! Where is she? I'm coming, Apple. My beloved followers. We have a very special guest with us here this evening. May I introduce, Fredric, the 1 handed arm wrestler. Now, Fredric wishes to be reunited with his loving brother. We all know how generous in spirit I am. And I'm going to grant him his wish. I bet you're wondering what this contraption is. Hmm. Do you like science? I absolutely love it. For example. Do you know how much water there is in an average human body? Your blood is 83% water. Your muscle tissue, 75%. The gristle and cartilage around your bones, 55%. Bone themselves, 25%. And your noggin up here, the old Grey matter is 90% water. Which brings the grand total to 10 precious gallons of H2O. 10 gallons, which this machine is designed to extract. I hope you choke on it, you mother fucker! My beloved followers. Who keeps you safe? - Zeus! - Zeus! Who quenches your thirst? - Zeus! - Zeus! - And who keeps you bloody entertain. - Zeus! You see. I'm not nearly as despicable as you think. - Let the juicing begin. - No! I beg your pardon. Did somebody say something? Did somebody say something? Release the girl. ( Me. Me.) And who exactly are you suppose to be? I-I'm a super hero. - Ha ha ha. - Ah-ha-ha... And what exactly is your super power? I said! What is your super power? This. - Heh-ha-ha.. - Ha-ha-ha... Oh. Come on, son. Give it your best shot. Well. That's rather disappointing, isn't it? Into the pool with him. - In the pool! - In the pool. - In the pool! - In the pool! Waaa! Oof. - Yeah! - Yeh! Whoa! Oh! I'm so happy to see you. Oh. I... I brought you something. I brought this back. You're the best. A reunion, how sweet. I'm real happy for you kids, I am. But, unless we all want to end up in that giant fucking blender over there, we need a plan, okay. So, listen up. I'm going to take the fat one. He might be strong but he'll be slow. You take the big guy. Yeah, you're going to have to surprise him. - You 2 take the ugly one, okay? - Yah!! What's the matter, kid? Are you scared? Yeah. Fear is good. Use it as a weapon, yeah. And girl, what is that thing? A dwarf? - No, that's my gnome stick. - Okay, whatever. I want you to swing as hard as you can - at that mother fucker's face. - Sir, yes sir! YAHHH! Huh ?! Yah! Ah! Feel the wrath of sister gnome! Ahh! Do you feel it? Come on! Apple say hi! I guess that is our Que. Aww! Ah-ha-ha-ha... You fat fucking fast. Apple. Aww! Not so fast now, are you, Fat fuck? Bravo. I have to admit I did not see that coming. We won. Now let us go. It's not how it works, kid. You changing the rules, are you, Zeus? It's my game. My rules. NO! I admire your resolve. But in the end you're just a loser. Hey, put the kid down. Play time is over, kid. Prepare to taste the turbo charge of justice. In the face! Watch out! Whoa! Hey kids. Now would be a good time to leave. Let's split up. Find them. Kill them. Bring me back their heads on pikes. Hey there, sleepy head. Where. Where are we? We're on a couch. Why. How? You got pretty beat up. You came back to save me. That was really sweet of you. You look pretty good in that suit. - You think so? - Uh huh. I just wished I could've done more. You know. I wished I could be more like the a real Turbo rider. Yeah, maybe you can't. But you could totally be Turbo kid. Ha. That man in the eye patch. It was him. I wished I could've stopped him. I-I should have. Instead I let you get shot. You're... a robot. You're it. Eh-ha-ha... You're pretty human like for a robot. I'm very high tech. I thought a robot was suppose to be evil? It depends on the model. Well. Can you shoot laser beams out of your mouth? Oh. No, silly. I'm just a friendship... Apple? Apple. Apple. Are you alright? Yeah. My bioelectric transmitter is damaged. - Does it hurt? - Oh, no. I'm just... losing some Hearts. Hm. What happens when you have no more hearts? I'll shut down for good. Shut Down? You mean you will die? Yeah. Yeah, I'll die. Oh. Shit! Kid? Look at you. Don't you think you're taking this comic book shit too far, huh? Look. We need your help. Heh-heh-heh. No, no, no... I don't care what trouble you got yourself into. I'm not interested. Hey! Put that back. Looks like you got yourself a girlfriend. Hmm. Oh. Give me that BACK, young lady. Hey. What are you doing? You're leaving? Yes, and if I were you, I'd be packing too. Fredric, the arm wrestler is gone. There's a shit storm coming. Some crazy bastard pissed off Zeus and he's on the war path. Oh, yeah. That was us. Hey, look. Ha. Wait! And stop following me! All we need is a bioelectric transmitter. She's going to die! Are you insane? - She's a robot. - Yeah, but she's my friend. I-I don't want to hear about it. Bagu, please. And. Why should I help you? What's in it for me? You can have this. Alright. But, just because it's you, you need to head north. Find a highway 64. There, you will find your... robot cemetery. You, might have some luck finding whatever it is you're looking for there. That is, If you are alive. Now, that's all I know. So, leave me alone. Huh. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Oh, and... Bagu, the water, it's people. People? Heh heh, nonsense. - Apple. - Look at the sign. Over here. Apple! Stupid-piece-of-god-damn-shit! Why does this freaking son of a bitch always have to happen to me! Aww! Ahh! Okay. How could this day got possibly fucking worse? Fuck. Hey, there, sleepy head. Are you okay? I'm fine. Are you sure? Oh, yes. See. I have 7.5 hearts left. Wait. How-How can you eat if you're a robot? Oh. I can eat, I can drink. I can sleep, I can breathe. The illusion works better if I behave a 100% like a human. I mean. 'Cause you know, no one wants to remind a human that his best friend is a robot. Well. I actually think it's kind of cool that you are a robot. And-And plus you got some pretty serious fighting skills too. Do you want me to teach you? - Yeah. - Yes. Are you ready to become a master in the art of kicking ass? Yes. Strike first. Strike hard. Show no mercy. That's it. That's it? I-break-rules! - Aw! - So. Strike first. Always surprise your enemy. Strike hard. Always remember the weak points of the human body. - Eyes, throat, genitals. - Okay. And show no mercy. So. You know. Show no mercy. Thank you. That was cool. This is so much fun. Glad it is for you. I love watching the sky at night. Do you know why there're so many stars? Oh. Because space consists of a whole lot of dust and gas that gathered to form billions and billions of stars and suns across the different galaxies in the universe. Yeah. No. I-I-I mean What I was going to say is... my mom once told me that when somebody dies, a star is born. So when the apocalypse happen, the sky lit up. all the souls of the people who died. So your mom is up there. Yup, with my father up there in the sky. That's weird. I... I never told anyone about my parents before. I'm- I'm sorry. No worries. It could happen to anybody. We'll fix you. I promise. T-Rex. Where the fuck am I? Zeus. How are you? You're looking fine and kind of serious. Is that a new coat? Aw! Ohh. Oh. That's... That doesn't look good. Oh, that's bad, that's bad. Look. Whatever it is, I'm sure we can talk this through. Were you actually going to leave town without saying goodbye? Me? Oh, I wouldn't do that. I was... just going to take a few days off. You know. Go to the beach, work on my tan. Just, I could really use some vitamin D. You know vitamin... I am looking for a young boy, a young girl and a big strapping cowboy. Cowboy, huh? Well, and a boy and a girl. Uh. Maybe. Maybe. No, it doesn't ring a bell. No. Oh. No-no-no! I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but in case you haven't noticed, your guts are literally attached to the wheels of this bicycle. - This is... - Ingenious. Yes. Thank you. Now. I know that you know where they are. So I suggest you start talking, - right away. - The robot cemetery. They are at the robot cemetery. That's all I know. Well, that was quick. Rather disappointing actually. You're going to help me put this back in? Right? Please. Do you have any idea how much time it took to set this up? Hm. Yeah. I'm sure you'll understand. Oh. No no-no no. No-no-no...! Aw. Aw. Awww! Shh. It's a dead end. Wah! Apple. Ahhh! I am sorry. We're so close. It's okay. You are the best friend that I ever had. Don't die on me. We're here. Hold on. Apple, wake up. Wake up. I don't want to be alone again. I have been traveling all day and I've developed quite a thirst. Would you have a drop of untainted water for a fellow traveler? Lower your hammer, please. That won't be necessary. I know that my friend here doesn't look quite as friendly as I do, but I assure you, all I need is a simple cup of water. Thank you . Oh, that's wonderful. It is exactly what I needed. Now. Where did you get the water? Because, this is my land. Taking anything from my land would be considered stealing and you don't want to steal from me, do you? You got what you wanted. Now, please leave. Where did you get the water? It's okay, honey. I got this. It's alright, honey. He's got this. Death by drowning. It's a luxury few men can afford. Stop! Now look at this. I admire your spirit, young lady, but your story has come to an end. Then let's make it memorable. Ah! NO-OOO! No. She is mine. Stop! Well. What have we got here? Alright, kid. Take your best shot. No, don't bother. He won't last long out there. Fore! You alright there, kid? You took quite a dose of that nasty gas. Where Apple? I'm sorry, kid. Why did you save me? I owed you one. Well, actually I need a new hand. Sure as hell didn't expect to find you there. It's like fate or some shit. Impressive, huh? - You know what that is? - Turbo Mega Blaster. Sure know your shit, kid, don't you. Huh. I guess you know where I'm going with this thing. I'm meeting up with an old mate, and we're going straight to Zeus. I'm going to shove that thing so far up his ass that he will taste his own shit. So, kid. What do you say? Let's roll. Yeah, let's roll. How does he keep sneaking up on me like that? What are you doing? Just play it cool, kid. Trust me . I love that dress. You know, Fredric, you make poor choices in friends. Ah, look. The arm wrestler has grown a new arm. What about you, kid? Feeling feisty after losing your super power and your girlfriend? Correction, robotic girlfriend. Her name was Apple. I admire your spirit, kid. But unfortunately, your story is about to come to an end. Then let's make it memorable. Well. You're the kid. You're full of surprises, aren't you? For Christ sake. Will you shut the fuck up and let's fight. I knew you would be eager. That's why I brought the party to you. It's play time. Get ready to fight , kid. This is gonna get ugly. I don't know if I can do this. A man never knows how strong he is, until being strongest is the only choice he has. Really? I don't know, kid. But it sounds good. Eyes! Throat! Genitals! Nice. Ladies. Ha ha. Now I'm feeling their love. Come on, bitch. Come on. You like that? Take this, bitch. That' it, sweetheart. Come to daddy. Hey, kid! Fucker! [E.r.r.] Good riddance, you fucker. You're alive! You didn't wait for me. I'm so sorry. I thought you were dead. No, no, no. I mean. I mean to start the fight. Oh. Well. I brought you back your... turbo glove. Thank you. You're welcome. You son of a bitch. Oh, you son of a... Such a rude individual. Look at us, huh. Deja vu, all over again. Oh, and you were right, it was memorable. Now. What was so difficult about that? Play time, is over, Zeus. You know. I really like most people, but you, I don't like. Well. I've wore you far too long. So much for trying to fit in. You're a robot? Yeah. You didn't know? Robot? Ha. I am a CC 1-11. Corporate companion. Designed to create and instigate corporate policy. Fashioned in the likeness of my master. He said to me, just before I bashed his head with his own golf club. Remember, you are only a robot. Only a robot! Well. I am the one standing here, not him. Sir? You are very mean. I don't expect a basic friendship unit to have a CPU fast enough to understand what I just said. But rest assured. Human beings are highly inefficient. Pest, actually. A lot like cockroaches. - You are a monster! - I was designed by your kind. You made me what I am. It was a mistake, and I'm trying to fix it. That's what superheroes do. Ha ha. How charming! Would you like to see what I do? Huh? Hey. You did good, Turbo kid. And when you watch the sky at night, I will be there. No. No. You did the right thing, kid. How's your shoulder? She'll be alright. You can't kill this cowboy. I can't believe you found the fucking water source. That's gonna save hundreds of lives, maybe more. Take good care of it. So, you're sure you want to leave then? Where're you going to go? See what the rest of the Wasteland looks like. Well. There is not much to see there, kid. I know Subtitle created by - Aorion -
