- When you think of Paris, what comes to mind? The Champs-Elysees, romance. Cheese. Well it wasn't always like that. You know, for four years the city of light went dark. There was violence, swastikas in the street, Martial law, and fear in people's eyes. Then came the liberation, but how can you feel liberated when your city has been crushed? When there's no food or electricity? When friends and neighbors are being betrayed and guns are still firing in the night? See, some things about a war, they, well they just don't change overnight. But it is from the ashes of war that friends are made and new loves are found. And that, well that was what it was like on the day Jerry Mulligan decided to stay in Paris. Oh, and it starts like this. - Jerry, there you are! - Hey! - I got our tickets, we're going home! Well tick tock Mulligan, we're gonna miss the train. - Thank you. - Ah, Paris. - We are home. - Oh no sir, please don't! No, no! - Hey, what's going on? - Collaborator! - At last, a fellow slaughterer of the French tongue. Welcome soldier, Corporal Adam Hochberg, Second Armored Division, at your service. - Lieutenant Jerry Mulligan, Fourth Infantry. But now it's just Jerry. - Well what can I get you, Just Jerry? - Anything. Coffee? - Whoa, too early in the day for coffee. Have some champagne. - This your cafe? - Might as well be. The Dutois gave me the run of the place. So when you shipping home? - That's just it, I missed my train. - Oooh. Kinda sorta on purpose huh? Yeah, yeah me too. I sure as hell didn't see parading this in front of the relatives. - Yeah, no parades for me either, thanks. - You wanna talk about it? Yeah, sorry, I'm sorry, it's just been lonely as hell around here, and frankly, I'm driving myself crazy with this damn concerto. - You a composer? - Well not if this is any indication. - It sounded great. - Something's missing, I can't put my finger on it. Hey, you an artist? - Yeah, starving and homeless. - Well the Dutois got another petit alcove upstairs, and they like to think of themselves as "art patrons". Even though they haven't got a casserole to urinate in. When they found out I was studying with Nadia Boulanger, you heard of her? - Mmm-hmm. - Yeah, I didn't think so. Well they stopped asking me for rent, and if you were a Jew, like me, they probably wouldn't charge you. - Shit! - Yeah, Parisian guilt. - Jesus. - Ah, exactly. Hey, can I take a peek? - Yeah. - Hey, these are good. You really are an artist. Hey Henri. Henri, English please! - Pour quoi? - Well because our French sucks. Jerry, Henri, Henri, Jerry. - How do you do? - A pleasure. - I like this one best, is this Dunkirk? - No, that's old. It's depressing. - Well I love depressing. Artists have a responsibility to show the dark underbelly to life. - Don't listen to him, paint what you love, make them pretty. - Hey, did you pop the question yet? Henri's trying to work up the nerve to ask his girl to marry him. - No no no, I have decided to write her a letter. - Why not just ask her, Henri? - Yeah Henri, what's her name again? - No, no, no, you are trying to prick me. - Uh, trick. Prick is something else. - You Yankee cads are celebrated for stealing our women, I am not allowing her near you. Now have you finished my song? Let's get to work, chip chip! - Chop chop! I'm helping him with his nightclub act. Henri's folks are in textiles the way Henry Ford is in cars. They don't know their only child wants to be a song and dance man. - Am a song and dance man! - So he's going over to America to help run their US operations while secretly becoming a nightclub performer. - Won't they find out if you're successful? - Oh he won't be. - Play. - This is the first stab, now. - Yes, it is brilliant, we know. He is a genius, your friend. You grew up together? - Yeah, yeah, same synagogue and everything. ♪ Days can be sunny ♪ ♪ With never a sigh ♪ ♪ Don't need what money can buy ♪ - Can we light up the accompaniment? - No we cannot. ♪ Birds in the tree sing their dayful of song ♪ ♪ Why shouldn't we sing along ♪ - It's like a funeral. - Kinda gloomy. ♪ I'm chipper all the day ♪ ♪ Happy with my lot ♪ - Happy, it doesn't sound that way. ♪ How did I get that way ♪ - Something something something. ♪ I got rhythm ♪ ♪ I got music ♪ - No no no no. ♪ I got my gal ♪ ♪ Who could ask for anything more ♪ - It's better in 4/4. - It is. ♪ I got daisies in green pastures ♪ ♪ I got my gal, who could ask for anything more ♪ - That's great. ♪ Old man trouble, I don't mind him ♪ ♪ You won't find him, 'round my door ♪ ♪ I got starlightmI got sweet dreams ♪ - Stop it! ♪ I got my gal, who could ask for anything more ♪ ♪ Who could ask for anything more ♪ Look at their faces.

Light flooded in Paris. Paris began to breathe freely again. I kept working on my music day and night, but something wasn't right. One morning I took Jerry with me to sketch the dancers at the ballet where I was accompanying classes. That's when, well, you'll see. - Sorry, I've got no idea what you're saying. - American. - Afraid so. - Milo Davenport. - Jerry Mulligan. - May I? - Yeah. - Oh, these really are rather good. Where do you see the work going next? - The Louvre? - Confident, I see. - Or deluded. - Do you have representation? - New to town. - Me too. I'm having a little gathering this evening at The Ritz. Might be worth your while, eightish? - Thanks. Nice meeting you. - Mademoiselle Davenport. - Ah, Madam Baurel. - Don't you look, er, American. - Thank you, but I'd rather look French. - Yes, well. I must get to my board meeting, but Maestro Zlutoslovsky is expecting you. - But he knows I'm new to ballet? - He knows that your father has done business with my husband and that you might wish to make a donation. - Surely he'll need more than a donation if everything was being funded by the Nazis. - We must always look to the future. - I see, of course. - Come. Maestro, my friend, Milo Davenport. - Ah. - I will see you after the audition. - Dancers, we do audition variation now for Mr. Z. - You. You vanished. - My grave apologies, madame. - Spare your breath. - There were so many blockades. I left work with more than enough time. - But you did not. I do not wish to see you, out of my sight. - Don't leave. Just stand there in the back. It's okay. Stay. - You are just too tall. Go be skyscraper somewhere. - Go on in. - Brava, my goodness! - Thank you. Dancers, we will be in contact. - Thank you. - Adam. - Lise. - Wait! What is your name, child? - Lise Dassin. - Dassin. Where did you study? - In Monte Carlo. Before the war. - Your mother is Arielle Dassin? - Yes. - Wonderful dancer. She must be so proud. - Please forgive me. I must hurry back to work at the Galeries Lafayette. I'm so sorry. - We have your details? - Yes. - Hang on! - You hang on. Maestro, forgive me for presuming, but I would consider funding your entire season if you would perhaps indulge me in one tiny whim, and that is to commission a short piece for that lovely young girl, what was her name? Lise Dassin. - So mysterious. And who wrote that exquisite music, is it famous? - From your mouth, I'm the culprit. - With a score by this talented young fellow, Monsieur... - Hochberg. - Monsieur Hochberg. - Well now-- - And designs by this noted American painter, Jerry... - Mulligan. - I'm afraid I have my own stable of designers. - You mustn't keep artists in a stable, they'll never get up out of the hay. Never mind. I specialize in the visual arts, and I must say this young man's work is-- - I am sorry. - A short ballet is all I suggest. Celebrating French and American youth, side by side, moving into the future together. Brilliant. Alive. - I can certainly invite Mademoiselle Dassin and this gentleman, but I must draw the line at designs, I'm very sorry. - I gotta run. It was great meeting you all. - Don't forget tonight, 8. - I won't. Bye. - Don't say no, that's all I ask. I'm not telling you what to do, but you should at least see his work. - Did you see that? The flower, the kiss? The way she looked at me? No one in my whole life had ever... God, I had a ballet to write. - Oh, sorry! - Madame, we are expecting a new shipment any day now. - May I help you? - Congratulations, you got the job! - What? - They're creating a ballet for you. - Monsieur, I'll find you another sales lady. - Oh there are no other ladies for me. - Amandine? - Yes, Amandine, please speak to this customer. Lise is giving her notice. She's gonna be a star. - Sir, I'm afraid I cannot help you. - But you can because I need a small bottle of perfume for a very beautiful ballerina. - Do you chase all the girls across town? - No. You're the first girl I've ever chased anywhere. Come on, what are the odds? I see you my first day in Paris, then again today? Both of us in the same place at the same time?

But I did not let anyone know we were acquainted. It would be incorrect to influence the outcome. Let me take us to lunch. - I must give my notice. - Of course. Yes. Well I know how much you have wanted this. How your mother would be pleased. You will no longer be a shop girl in this unfortunate place. And needless to say, I am beside myself with joy. I will see you at home. No no. Good to see you, as always, Mademoiselle Dassin. - Dearest... - You will be pleased to know Lise has been hired by the ballet. - She has? - Yes. Now have you asked her? - Mother. - You are too old to be unmarried. You are beginning to draw attention to us. We can't afford such prying. - The war is over, the Nazis are gone. - Shhh! My god! We must always appear blameless and correct in all things. - This is also why we have walls, dear. - The walls have ears. The world is filled with treachery. - I am writing my letter of proposal at this moment. - Letter dear? - Mother, I am simply concerned that Lise might not feel the same way about me. - Oh Lise clearly loves you. And if you don't ask her soon, someone else will. You will have missed your chance. Dearest beloved. Dearly beloved, no. Dear Lise. - Cher Maman. - Cheri. - You and papa would both be so happy. - I would be so happy. - I have been hired to dance with the ballet. - To dance with you through this adventure we call life. Oh my Christ. - I miss you. With every fiber of my being. I'm afraid you might never receive this. I wish for you. - I wish you were here to help me make a difficult decision. - With all my heart. - For I must choose between doing what is expected of me and following my heart. - To choose me as your loving husband. - I know Henri loves me, and I love him too. - I you want, that is. - But is this romantic love? The kind you and papa built your happiness upon? - Oh will you marry me, Lise? Oh please, Lise, please. No, no, no. - If he should propose, what do I do? The Baurels have taken such good care of me throughout the war. And I suppose love grows. - Dear Lise, true love comes but once in a person's life.

She'll have to love me. - Told ya. - I cannot accept this. - Why not? I bought it from the prettiest girl in the shop. Come on, don't go. - Oh like all American men, you are too presumptuous. - Oh, like all French girls you... Nothing. There couldn't be another girl like, say your name for me? - Lise. - Beautiful. But sad. - No it is not. - How about Lizzie? Or Eliza? Liza. - I like my name. - Liza's happier. - No it is not. - Are you sure about that? I drew this my first day here.

We are both beside ourselves for you both. - What is it, Henri? - What is what? - You wanted to ask me? - Yes. About the ballet, I want to hear everything. - Oh cheri, you seem nervous. - No, no, no, no, happy! And beside myself as well. Look, I am all the way over here, I am so beside myself. - You seem-- - No, I don't seem. It's just, well I-- - What? - Oh I sound so selfish. - This doesn't mean I have to spend my life in Paris.

You were positively glowing from the moment you came in, you seem... Transformed. - I did? Yes. - I do? - Something marvelous has happened. - No. Yes, it's written all over your face. - What? - The ballet. - Oh yes! - Did something else happen? - No! My god! - Please don't curse!

You look like a refugee. - I am a refugee, running from you. - You do look a little scroungy, pal. - I do? - Only an artist manque thinks art must be tragic. - Is that right?

No, I would tell anyone who asked that you are one of the most asinine, superficial people-- - Okay, I gotta run. - Look, here is the proposal, I was about to hand it to her when she beat me to the pinch. - Punch. - Punch. - Chere maman. - Maman?

Oh and by the way, I got us a little club in Montmarte two weeks from tonight, so cheer up. Another five rounds with fries please? And more good news, I got a commission. - Wait. "I suppose love grows." It does. It will. I'm sorry, you were saying? Montmarte, wonderful! Mayonnaise please, not ketchup. - Oh yes, ketchup! Mayonnaise on fries? God, how do you say... In French? Are you kidding me with that? - Hello! Swell digs you got here. - Thanks. - I brought you a little something. - Ooh, let me see. Oh, nice composition, point of view. It's a shame someone already painted it. - What do you mean? - Cezanne got there first. Find the voice of Jerry McMillan. - It's Mulligan. - Cocteau said "Originality is trying "to be like everyone else and failing". Only you're too deft. You're gonna have a harder time finding something you fail at. - Cocteau said all that, huh? - But you might have this new ballet to experiment with. - I might? - If you play your cards right. I persuaded Zlutoslovsky to give you a shot at designing the ballet. - Thank you! - Bring your ideas to rehearsal. - Jeez. - And don't play it so safe. - Okay. - Take this hint of exuberance and explode it. - Okay. - And don't act so humble. People might start falling for the act. - Speaking of people, where is everyone? - Am I not enough for you? - You said something about gallery representation? - Yes, I'm opening my own gallery and looking for undiscovered geniuses to feature in my gala. I for one intend to take this city by force. - They just came through a bit of that. - No matter how much cash you offer, they still have such set ideas about "the correct way to do things". - Well it's their country. - They didn't seem to mind letting the Nazis run it for a while. - I'm not sure they had much choice. - Well neither do I. I'm compelled from within, an instinctive hunger to make a contribution, a difference, a niche for myself. - A name. - No, no, a home here in the city of love. - That's Rome. - Love, light, same thing, wouldn't you say? - I wouldn't know a thing about it. But you're quite a pistol, Miss Davenport. - Oh call me Milo.

Lise, you are acquainted with this personage? - Hey you. - So handsome Adam, look at you. - Yes, well... - I didn't think I'd see you 'till later. I was hoping we could, you know... I don't know. - What? - Go for a walk, I don't know, I'm blathering. Listen, I'm writing so many new themes for you, I hope you can keep up.

Are you not well? - People are always confusing me with someone, it makes my neck ache terribly. - Confusing you with, er-- - No, you are the one who is confused, please follow me, I'll show you to the coat room and bar. - Oh, you keep the liquor in the closet? - Who the hell are these phonies? - They are my parents, thank you very much. And they must not know my secret. - Which one? - Which one? - My nightclub act. - Nightclub? - Father! This is, I'm sorry, your names? - Oh, I'm Frick, he's Frack. - You'll excuse me while I show the Frick-Fracks to the bar. - Hey, that's my design! - Oh that was my surprise. And why I'd didn't tell you the party was for the ballet. You've been hired. - I have? - Yes! These people are on the ballet board and they're welcoming me. I want you to be celebrated as well. - Yeah? Thank you. Jeez. I appreciate it. - You're welcome. - And what about the dancers? - They're performing a little excerpt of something, what about them? - I don't know. I just gotta get a drink, excuse me. - Oh, could I have one too? - The dancers are here? - Yeah, what's wrong? - Didn't realize this thing was for the ballet. Christ, I gotta get outta here. Sorry. - Your attention please. A tender hand of appreciation upon our guest of honor, Mademoiselle Milo Davenport, who has brightened our future so at the Ballet du Chatelet in her role as international dilettante. - Well I'm speechless. I'm truly honored to have even the smallest hand in a work by the inimitable Zlutoslovsky. Where's Jerry? Oh, my talented friend Jerry Mulligan has created these daring, new designs for the ballet. We're simply honored to have any part in your storied institution. Well it is all beyond my most feverish dreams, I thank you. Thank you. Please take your seats! - I don't feel well. You don't want to get it. - Maestro Zlutoslovsky has kindly agreed to allow a performance of a work no longer in the repertoire. One I loved in my youth. How many of you recall the celestial ballets of Ivor and Irina Popover? No-one? - Why are you so fidgety? - Am I? - Shhh! - Yeah, you're all over the... - I give you now, The Eclipse of Uranus. - The hell are you doing? I can't just, would you stop? - Are you kidding me right now? Thanks a lot. Is that all the dancers? - Yeah. - Thank god. - Please! - Sorry. - Shh! - I'm so sorry. - What's the matter with you? ♪ I've got fidgety feet, fidgety feet, fidgety feet ♪ - Respect, sir! ♪ Oh what fidgety feet, fidgety feet, fidgety feet ♪ ♪ Say mate, come and be my sway mate ♪ ♪ How can anyone resist that rhythmical beat ♪ ♪ You will never go wrong, never go wrong, never go wrong ♪ ♪ If you toddle along, toddle along, toddle along ♪ ♪ All I need's a partner to make my life complete ♪ ♪ Two more fidgety, fidgety ♪ What the hell are you on? ♪ I've got fidgety feet, fidgety feet, fidgety feet ♪ ♪ Oh what fidgety feet, fidgety feet, fidgety feet ♪ ♪ Say mate, come and be my sway mate ♪ ♪ How can anyone resist that rhythmical beat ♪ ♪ You will never go wrong, never go wrong, never go wrong ♪ ♪ If you toddle along, toddle along, toddle along ♪ ♪ All I need's a partner to make my life complete ♪ ♪ Two more fidgety, fidgety, fidgety ♪ ♪ Fidgety, fidgety, fidgety ♪ ♪ Feet ♪ - Didier? You despise this sort of music. - No, dear. We agreed to say we dislike jazz while under occupation. But you seem to believe every word you speak. - Oh, I, er... But I... No, it... Oh. We have covered over so much, I can't even find me. Hello everyone! I am most especially honored to be able to present to you now the newest star in our firmament, the unforgettable Lise Dassin. Monsieur Baurel and I cannot contain our joy one minute longer. We seize this moment to share with you our blessed news. Our dear son, Henri, and Lise are promised to be we'd. Oh my goodness! That's wonderful news! - I wonder if you might play something a little more festive? - My themes are decay and the inevitability of death. - Now that jazz is no longer banned, I would not have the faintest idea where to go to listen. - Well then you must allow me and Jerry to take you both to hear some. Oh darling, if I wanted to hear some good American jazz here in Paris, would you know where to send me? - Oh yeah, I know a guy playing tomorrow night in fact. He puts on a really good act. - Oh good then. Thank you. - Is something the matter? - No! No. If you'll excuse me a moment. - Hey. Penny for your thoughts? - You'd be overpaying. And not everything's for sale in this world, excuse me. - Those are such lovely shoes. - Oh, you like? Are you one of those rare gents who likes to shop? Jerry won't ever go with me. - I would be delighted. - You would? Well you seem like you might be a lot more fun than the Americans I slum around with. You and I are cut from the same expensive bit of cloth. Sometimes it's hard to know if people like you for you or what you can do for them. - It helps if they have stood in your shoes. - These might pinch. - Look me in the eye and tell me you love him. - Would you know the first thing about love, Jerry? - Every day I've waited for you by the Seine. I'm sorry for whatever I've done. - I don't want you to apologize for who you are. You are one of a kind and I will always... Care for you. - Care for? Is that what Victor Hugo and Zola and Flaubert wrote about? - My love, if you knew the first thing about them you'd know they only wrote tragedies. You gave me a lovely gift. Those afternoons where I had no history and no past. - But apparently you do. - And so do you. - I don't love her. - Well she seems to think you do. And perhaps you should. - No, no, it's all for show, I mean I couldn't-- - I don't want to know! - You deserve so much more than afternoons. You deserve someone to love you for all time. - Henri loves me very much. - Yeah, the way I loved my first puppy. - And I have obligations. - What obligations? - I must honor them. - Tell me what they are. - Not here, not now. - Meet me then. - No, Jerry. - I need to understand. - I am not a visitor in my own life. I don't have this luxury. - Our love is not a luxury. - Go inside and be kind to that woman who's clearly going out of her way to give you what she thinks you want! - I don't care about any of that! I don't want money or fame. I want you. - That's foolish. You will go far with her. - You are all I've ever wanted. And ever will. I love you. - Go inside, they're watching. - And you love me. - We have pretended too many things. - Yes. - Yes of course I love you, but I am not free to love! - Now you're killing me here, why? - Let go! We are both killed then! - But why aren't you free? - Because life is not like your American movies. - Why not? You love me. You said you love me, you said it! - Well it's been quite a night. - Are you pleased? - Are you? - Yes. - Is there anything you wish to tell me? - Do you worry what people will say? - About? - The two of us. What about us? - Our differences. - Do you, is the question. - You're quite the success. - Thank you. Heady stuff. - I'll say. - Anything you'd like to discuss with me? - Nope. You?

Two dressers each, many beautiful costumes, and I will have 20 beautiful women to back me up. - Why? Can't you defend yourself? - Stop making jokes. - Why do you want to take that beautiful girl to America just when she's about to be a star here in Paris? - I don't believe I've ever heard you take an interest in another human being's happiness. Why start now? - I watch her every day in rehearsal, she's the real thing, what the hell are you doing? - She has a mind of her own, she's not a slave. - Oh yeah? From what I see she bows and scrapes around you and your family. Why's she so beholden to you? - What are you talking about? - I got a ballet to finish, and don't know how, so why I'm wasting my time here with you, I really don't know. - All right. Lise's father was in the employ of my family, our butler, when we would summer in Monte Carlo. Her mother was with the ballet. - Go on. - When she retired, the Dassins returned to Alsace. When the Maginot Line was crossed Lise was sent here, her parents intending to follow. Certainly no-one believed the Nazis would dare to take Paris. - No. I bet a lot of that Vichyssoise crowd at your parents party knew perfectly well what was coming and didn't mind so much. - Yes yes, you and your friend Jerry snickered at the formality of my family. Perhaps you imagine that their morality consists of nothing but posing. Through the occupation, my family hid Lise in our home. They funneled a fortune into the Resistance where I also worked, day and night, to see that Lise was not the only one spared. - You? - My mother is obsessed with appearances because she knows what can happen when you are discovered doing what is right by the wrong people. Or even by the right people if it is not the right time. No-one can know any of this, please. - Lise's parents? - They were arrested, beyond that we have no idea. - I got an idea. You and parents took a lot of risks, made a lot of sacrifices. - Correct. - All to protect a perfectly innocent person. - Yes. - And now she has to sacrifice her happiness for you? - No, Lise loves me and I her! - Not the way people mean when they say that word! She deserves real passion, Henri, real happiness. - I don't know what you are implying! - You got charm and talent, my friend. And what you did during the war, that decency and bravery? Well you're gonna have to stick to that road in peacetime unless you wanna lose all that shine you've earned. I'm giving it to you straight. You take it or leave it.

You are making a fool of yourself. Are you so contemptuous about dignity and privacy as a family? - Mother and father, I have kept from you the truth of my desires. - Not in front of all these strangers. - Is this why you suggested I bring the Baurels here tonight? - No, hold on. I didn't know. - Did you suggest this? - Yes, but I didn't know she was asking for Henri's family. - Let me take us somewhere else. - No. I wish to go home now. - I'll escort you to your car. - Mother, father, I'll be home. - Who could have my thought my own son was capable of such things? That was absolutely remarkable, you know! - Oh. - It would be a terrible waste for you to spend your time in the fabric industry when you have such talent. - Oh, er, well yes, yes of course. If only we'd known, but... - Now we do. - Yes, but I just want everything to stop changing so often and so swiftly. - Of course. - You understand? - Of course, mother. I always understand. - You do. Yes. Wonderful. So marvelous. Truly. And off we go, dear. Very quickly now please. - You see, it all worked out. - So you did arrange this? - No, Lise, let me explain. - Jerry, just leave her alone. - Get out of my way. Sorry, okay? But Lise and I are in love. - You seem to forget that we are engaged! - She doesn't need to be bought and sold and treated like a little doll by a mama's boy who couldn't even bother to defend his own country! - You know so much about other people! You are so wrong, my friend! Lise is the one I devote my life to. Artists are supposed to see more, understand more. What do you even know about this woman you say you love? - Henri's no coward, kiddo. He fought in the Resistance and his family hid Lise during the war. She's a Jew. Her parents were arrested by the Nazis, Henri and his parents saved her life. - Adam. - Oh yeah, don't tell anyone. - Why didn't I see it? Of course she didn't want to talk about it. All those years in hiding. I hated fighting. Why I had to catch my buddy's brains in my lap, I'll never know. But if I don't fight now for the one person, the first and only person I've ever loved. Sorry Henri, coward or no, you're still a shit to let Lise marry you out of duty instead of love. It's not good enough buddy boy, she's-- - Come, darling. I have a long day tomorrow and the score still isn't finished. - Yes. - Liza, I'm begging you. - Don't. - Well I always wanted to know who closed the bars, and now I know. It's me. - So much we've had to endure. Everyone just being alive. It ain't what they tell you when you're a kid. So much you can't ever change. Wait. You can. You, oh that's what I've been missing! - What? - That bloody frog was right all along. - About what? - About my music, about art. Life is already so dark, if you've got the talent to make it brighter, give people joy and hope, why would you withhold that? Oh my god. It's gotta be a celebration. This whole ballet, it... Goddammit, I hate it when French people are right. - I was gonna leave these outside her door, but... - I'll deliver them. - Thanks. - Oh, uh, excuse me, I gotta go stand in a hole in the ground. - What? - With the... - Oh. Special delivery! - Thank you. - I offered to bring them. You know, Jerry was never serious about me. And he taught me something I didn't know, he gave me the truth, which is not something people in my position hear all too often. Money can't buy love. Love is given. Well as only the French would say at such a happy moment, merde. - It's going to be a fiasco. - Oh it's good to be nervous. - It's not nerves. I don't feel any freedom on stage, no passion. I have only felt that once in my life and I can't find it now. - Well think of when you felt it. And then you'll dance like the star you truly are. - Okay, you good? Have a wonderful show. - You were incredible. - Thank you, Jerry. - But you were, you were on fire. I'm so sorry. - No. I couldn't have danced the way I did tonight... Without imaging you up there with me. - Really? - A toast to our generous benefactress, Milo Davenport. - Thank you. Most people do what they're told. But some obey higher laws and choose to do what's right. To Madame, Monsieur, and Henri Baurel for keeping the flame of art and freedom alive through France's darkest hours. Bravo! - Bravo. - I never want this night to end. You seem a little... - No. - Are you sure? Having a change of heart? - Maybe finding one. - Ah. - I really do love her, you know. - I know. - I just don't know what to do. - I think you do. Call me in the morning. - Darling, let's take a drive. - Is everything all right? - Yes. Yes. - One moment, then I'll change. Adam. You know, you made all this happen. You did. You are my American in Paris. - Well I thank you. Lise? You're making a mistake. Love, true love, it's all that matters. You know, duty, honor, forget it, but love? Love is even more important than art. - Henri's waiting. - Go, go. - Goodnight, Adam. - Goodnight. - Congratulations. You are the toast of Paris, you know. - Absolument. - What? - You're the toast of Paris. - I am? - Says so in all the papers. - Every last one. - So that's how it happened, I guess. And you know what? I even got the girl. Nah, fooled you didn't I? It's true, I just... I put her in the music, where she belongs.
