'I am crying my heart out, my dear' Saajan, come. We'll have a couple of drinks. 'I shall not touch your beautiful body' 'With my hands that have written stories of sins' Dude, did you get anything? Got some great fish. We'll fry it. 'I shall not kiss you' Saajan! - Yes! Enough of you bathing! Come and have a drink! Throw that towel here. It's lying there. You've been asking for 'forgiveness' since the afternoon. I am hesitant to ask for forgiveness directly. That's why I am singing. Listen to this. [Singing another old Malayalam song] [Continues singing] Which movie is this from? - I don't know. 'O Goddess who turned my heart into a lotus flower' 'Forgive me' 'Forgive me' Dude, everything is a confession, right? Confusion? - Not confusion. Confession. Confessing the truth. Dude, going by the way he's singing these songs, I think Saajan's export business' confession has gone for a toss. Hey! Hey! Watch out after this election! Who will you be once the election is over? Yes. Who, Saajan? He had to stand in the scorching sun for 7 hours when he went to meet the MLA. And did anything happen after that? Aren't you going to Thiruvananthapuram, Saajan? Even though I was stuck in the sun there, you guys had enough to eat and drink, right? To listen to your song... Not just food and drinks... You will have to offer us money as well! That's correct. First return the money you already owe me, you rascals. Rascal is your dad! Punnamoottil Samuel. At least I have someone whom I can call my dad. But who knows who made you guys? You scoundrel... You scoundrel! - Don't get drunk & speak nonsense! Move! Saajan, aren't you ashamed? - Kochumon! If you dare intervene... - Leave me! Let me see what the hell he'll do. I'll knock you out. Try doing that. We'll see. Got one already, right? Leave me, you scoundrel. Or I'll hit you too! Saajan, I've been wanting to hit you since long. Just because I hang out with you, don't try to boss me. I'll thrash you! Don't show off your Punnamoottil family's arrogance here. Get going! Go! After being with me all this while... Didn't I trust you guys... ... as my friends all this while? You were waiting for this Saajan to fall, right? Bloody dogs! - Saajan! Stop your stupid drama and go home! Get going! It won't be sweet. I don't think anyone can have coffee here, if we wait for you to buy sugar. It's like you're coming here only because you can't go home drunk. Shall I get hot water for Saajan to bathe? I'll drown Saajan in hot water! - Oops! She's angry! Out in the streets, one can hear only Saajan's gambling stories. I'm fed up! During my childhood, due to the debt that my father had created, my mother led a disgraced life in front of our family and the townsmen. I never respected your father. And you? - Don't talk ill of my father! But I don't want such a life. I know how to take care of both my kids. They don't need a father, just for namesake. If you repeat this, I'll call all the townsmen here. Then I'll say that Punnamoottil Shamely's son is staying in his wife's house now, since he's petrified of facing his dad when he's drunk. 'Saajan Bakery Since 1962' Saajan Bakery Saajan Bakery With the unique taste of the town... Saajan Bakery. Cooked in pure coconut oil... Achappam, Neyyappam, Kuzhalappam, Arimurukku.. (Snacks in Kerala) Ellunda, Ariyunda.. (More snacks) Preparing a treasure trove of such delicious items.. Saajan Bakery, since 1962. Australia! After six months... I'll fly away from here. Uncle, have you seen the movie 'Irakal'? It was shot somewhere around this area. Through the right and then... That's how I should say it, right? I'll give you the proof. Over here. It won't go missing without your knowledge, right? Give it! Here you go. - 2000 is fine for now. Go and play with your kind! Haven't I told you to wear a cap? - Ruining my hair, you devil? I'll grill you! - Uncle! What are you doing, kids? - Uncle! Leave me! If you won't let me sit at the counter, I'm not sitting anywhere. Ask your husband to distribute stuff to people! I have my own institution! - Yeah, right! Go! Bob's Ceramics, since 2014. Smash! Uncle! Sicily Chechi. Uncle! Shouldn't we leave? Come fast. See you. - Okay. Let's go. I'll serve it hot. I'll serve it hot. Give them in plenty! And get the money too. Give them in plenty! Hot fritters! Over here. Fritters shop. Come closer and we'll give you in plenty. Come closer and we'll give you in plenty. We'll serve them hot. Oh no! Get down! Why are you fumbling? I'm not from this town at all! I'm leaving! See you! Where were you? I was coming from Manimala through Chunkappara... I had some onions. Where's Bobin? - I don't know. O dear Lord of Parumala, don't make that John curse me in the morning itself. Phew! I'm relieved. Hello! Is everything ready there? Achaya, I've been trying you for so long. Where are you? Dude, what do I say? The alarm didn't ring in the morning. I woke up late. Is everything ready there? I've mixed the drinks. If you come fast, we can do the rest. Okay. I'll be there now. What is it? - Halwa. You spread it at the base. Don't give oily stuff to the people who're coming from Chengannur initially. Just give them our cakes and the mixed squash drinks. Or they'll blow up their tummies with gas and curse us in vain. Achaya, Betsy Chechi is calling. - Oops. Don't pick up! She's been calling me since morning. That Bobin must have stolen money in the morning itself. I'll listen to her curses once I get there. You do your work. - Okay, Achaya. It's good to have a banana in the morning. Had you come for Chunkappara Sam's daughter's wedding? Stop gossiping and keep that banana bunch there. Kids, all of you go out. - You get lost! Oh my God! These damn kids are so strong. What's this flavour? - Mango. Give it to everyone inside & outside. It's good. John! - Cheriyachan! Did you take out all the stuff? Give me the money. Let me go quickly. Or else, Betsy will come here. Let her come. I've invited her also for the function. Oh! She doesn't go for any celebration nowadays. Only for deaths. It's been 8-10 years since she got married, right? Did they avoid having children, or is there any other issue? Give me the money. We'll do the talking later. Then hold the baby. I should hold the baby? - Yes. She won't pee, right? - No. She has diapers. She's crying. - There's 5000 Rupees. Hold the baby. It's okay. It's totally fine. - She's crying. It's Betsy!. - Don't pick up! Don't! You picked up? Hey! We were just talking about you. He's here. I'll put him on. Here you go. Hello dear... Well, that... The cash must be in the counter itself. Where else would it go? Okay. Hang up! You bloody rascal of a nephew! How many kids do you have in total? This is the fourth one. Four kids! You should remember that! She'll make my life miserable today. Hello! Why do you have to shame me calling on other's phones? You didn't pick up, right? I was very busy there. There were so many things in my hand. Uncle, don't be all sentimental in the morning itself. Bring the car here. - Say that properly. If you are with me, it will be a moral support for me. My dear Bobin... - What is it? I'd met her last week at Thiruvalla junction to talk about this divorce. She sneered at me asking if I was going to start a matrimonial service. I get really scared as soon as I see her. This time I am with you, right? My bad luck that I was born as your cousin. Hey bro! Will anything happen anytime soon? Even my uncle would do a better job at washing the car. Hey! I'll give you only half the money. You can talk to the manager, Madam. Then call him here. Let me ask him where he brought this dirty water from. [Inaudible cursing] - She is angry. The lawyer is here to talk about the divorce. Enough! Antony, start the car. Chechi, it's said that 'Life must go on', right? What? I got this as a Whatsapp message and Bobin liked it when I sent him. You need to take a decision about this! How long has it been? The sooner, the better. Right? - Yes. That would be very good. I have lots of work to do. Chechi (Elder Sister)... Don't trouble the lawyer further. Please tell him your final decision. Are you going to run, or are you coming with me? This is your third set of spectacles this month. Now don't forget this also at some bar and come back here again! Here! Try it! Read and see if it's clear. Let someone come to this shop at least like that, Philipose. I didn't say anything! It's clear, right? - Okay. - Then get going. Take this cover as well. Go! Go! - Okay. Uncle, did she come here? She came, vented out all her anger towards you and left. Now you can start. That's why I'm sitting here keeping this shutter open, right? Hey! I had stopped talking. That phase is over. But I'm serious now. You people should intervene and talk to her. Either she should go back to Michael. Otherwise, she should grant him divorce. How long has this been going on? My dear kiddo, calm down. Your dad Saajan was even more short-tempered. We never got scared seeing his temper. And you're trying to scare me? If you are so brave, say all this directly to your sister. Can you do that? So you won't support me, uncle? Did I mean it that way? In a family, there would be disagreements and arguments. Should you call for a divorce immediately? It's been a year since she came back home now. When she was sent to college, she should have studied. There weren't any men here or what? To bring someone from Theni? She doesn't call Michael at all now? She has blocked him. So they have really decided to separate? That's what I'm also suspecting. I need to migrate to some place, after she starts living a proper life. I'll do one thing then. I'll try talking to her. You should talk! Okay then! Hey! Hey! Give it back. - This? It's quite expensive. It's quite old, right? - Yeah, get going. This shop has been around since my dad's time. You've also been around since your dad's time. Sitting there jobless! - Trying to steal my stuff in the morning? I should tie this on a thread and hang it on her neck. Hello! Hello? You rascal! It's you? Okay, I'll put her on. Is it snowing there now? Or is it really hot? Cheriyachan! Come here. Huh? - Come fast. Hold on, kiddo. I'll put her on now. I saw her sitting like she was lifeless, on the sofa outside. What is it, Betsy? What happened, dear? I just dozed off while I was resting there. I got really scared seeing her sitting like that. Then? - Then I got up and came here. No. She woke up when I shook her and woke her up. How are you now? Who's on the phone? It's Reethamma's son. Here. - Cut the call. Cheriyachan! This is not child's play. Take her to some hospital. Or else, she will have the same fate as our Mary. All of you get back to work! Go! Do whatever you want! Why should I care? Don't be so angry, dear. Your mother also had the same disease. Fatigue. When I said that then, no one listened to me. Finally, when she was tested in the ICU, she had cholesterol 100, sugar 100, pressure 100.. Everything 100/100. Finally she suffered at Pushpagiri hospital for six months. So? Let's go meet Dr. Paraykkal. Who? That blind guy? He can immediately say what the disease is once he checks with this steth! Then you don't need any test or anything. He's the best! Uncle, he came and ate buns during my dads' death. Lucky that he's still alive, right? Sit down, Saajan. There you go! That's not Saajan. It's Bobin. Medicines to get rid of this shivering haven't been invented or what? Shut up! Get everything checked. I've written everything in it. Okay. Does it make any noise when you go above 80 kmph? It must be the wheel cup. Use an alloy wheel. It will go away. Alloy wheel would reduce the mileage. That's rubbish. What happened? We couldn't catch her vein while taking her blood. Very good. Will you make me paralyzed? This happens sometimes, Chechi. What happens sometimes? Chechi, this is Puthuchottil Pappachan's daughter. How does it matter who she is? She joined just one month ago. It's been one month and you haven't learned this? She got only my hand to learn her job or what? She pricked all over my hand! Enough! I don't need any damn test! Her attitude is like she's a doctor! She said all that just because a needle moved a little. They are from the Punnamoottil family. It's been a year since this elder one came here, after fighting with her husband. She waits to find someone to curse every morning. The younger one is no different. Can you switch on the AC? I'm not sad because she shouted at me. That Bobin knows me. You can leave early today if you want to. Maybe he would have forgotten me. [Singing a prayer song] Why are you so late? - What? - Why are you so late? [Continues the prayer] Merin, tea for everyone, please. [Prayer song continues] Didn't you buy milk today, dear? - No. Isn't there anything to eat, Merin? - No. Praise the Lord! Dear brothers and sisters of the Lord... Today we have got black tea. That's because Merin got late today. Also, because Lord Jesus didn't grant us the blessing... of getting milk from the shop. So let's pray hard that Jesus would bless us to have milk tea in the coming days. [Prayer song] You can't figure this out so easily. It's quite difficult. Yes! Switch off the motor! Anyone can switch it off. Are you going to turn it off or not? Didn't he switch off the motor yet? The water is still spilling. Didn't I ask you to pluck curry leaves? Hello? Hello? Who's this? Betsy, tell me what I should write on the Bishop's birthday cake. They've sent it on WhatsApp to our bakery's number. Check it. Who was supposed to send it? I've saved the number on it. No. Nothing has come. Give it to me. Let me check. I checked. Nothing has come. Shucks. What is this? Okay. I'll write 'Happy Birthday Bishop' then. Send a case of Cola. Rusk... We have rusk here. Send it after two days. Ever since mom lost her teeth, she loves having rusk. Ask her to have it after dipping it in tea. Or it would hurt her gums. Shall we leave? Uncle, do you have anything else to tell Shaji? Uncle? Merin, shall we go for a noon show? What's wrong with him? Come. You can go in this. Isn't she on Facebook now? Deepthi, you know what? After that incident of theirs, that Saji and team were almost about to erect a flex at the junction. They spread such disgusting stories about her all around town. You went for further studies to Secunderabad, right? I was in IHD here in that period. Ajeesh's girlfriend was with me there. Janet from Thekkel... - That Philadelphia girl? - Yes. The same one. She told Ajeesh one day... ... that some video clip of Merin & Abhilash has come out. I asked her once when I saw her at the auto stand. 'I heard you got a clip. We didn't get any!', I said. She left with an embarrassed face. Good that she went to Philadelphia. Otherwise I would have killed her. Keep reading the magazine. Don't do any work! Pay up! Here. Drink this. It's the 'Saudi Shake'. This is full of dry fruits. What happened today? You seem to be in a good mood. Hey! That Bobin has been talking about migration for long. - Is he serious? - Of course. How does he think that... ... the Australian Government would let him stay there? You don't know, Chechi. Bobin knows more about things abroad, than about things happening here. Just that he doesn't have the looks. He's quite something. He has great knowledge. Yeah, right! Is that why he got stuck here after college? That's pure bad luck. We sent him with a visiting visa to Oman, to Michael's cousin's place. He came back after two weeks! Maybe he didn't like the climate there. Now he's after me... pestering me to get divorced. Will any younger brother in this world do this to his elder sister? If he wants me to get divorced, get me married to Shijo in Georgia and send me away from here, and sell the house & property in Chunkappara for his migration, he won't go anywhere in this lifetime. Well, how's the Saudi shake? Shall I get you one more? I needed to go somewhere urgently. I forgot. I'll leave now, Chechi. Drink this and go! Oman shake was superb, Chechi. I should've known when she offered it to me, that she'd turn violent. Did you see that movie in which the aliens dry up the sea? No, man. I ran out of data. I'll check tomorrow. Dude, there's more poverty in America than in India or what? Here we get 2 GB for free daily. But it gets over at 4 AM. You know? Just don't die ****kin off. 'Appear before me, O Messiah' What do you want? The Church youth wing is conducting a youth march tomorrow at Kottayam. I have to go for that. So I need to check the train timings. What will you do during a youth march, uncle? It's for the youth, right? All unmarried people are part of the youth, dear. Don't you know that? - Yeah, right! Give it to me. Why? - To check Venad express' time. Venad express always comes on the same time. It doesn't keep changing every week. This is such a nuisance. I'll check in the morning and tell you. If you want to eat something now, go and grate the coconut. I should grate the coconut? Even though I'm a youth, I'll also be hungry, right? Get going, youth icon. 'I shall grate the coconut, O Messiah' Is your discussion done for the day? What's happening in Philadelphia? Winter has started. Gibin takes one hour to move the ice from the road every morning. I was discussing with him about a snow shovel machine. A business of renting out those machines. There's great scope during the winter. Then ask him to start a franchise of your 'Bob Ceramics' over there. Even if the people of Ranni don't buy your commodes & bathtubs, Philadelphians would buy. For sure! If the last flood hadn't happened, there would have been 2 branches of Bob Ceramics at Thiruvalla & Kozhenchery. Yeah, right! As if your commodes & bath tubs would be damaged in rising water. Even after water rising to 2 stories height here, and losing everything we had, didn't we bring our bakery back to normal from scratch? It's a commercial space which can get a rent of Rs.6000 per month. Stop holding on to your commodes, and vacate that place. Rajan is looking for a shop to store his rubber sheets. Or give it to her. She has some plans in mind. Embroidery, boutique or something like that. Oh! So she has no plans of going back? Everyone else can start all sorts of things. No one here understands my passion. I'll sell it. I'll sell everything. In that case, when you sell it, sell everything except that bath tub. If we keep it on top of our terrace, the next time a flood hits, we can get inside that, row it and escape. Instead of a life boat? Where's the fish fry? There were only two. I ate both. What will I eat then? Hey! If you have a fish fry, give it to him. He needn't turn into a naxal because of that. There's no more fish fry. - Bring it. Eat these thorns if you want. Get lost. - You get lost. Here. You can eat this. Just one? What's she doing all the time on that phone? It's been 2-3 days now. She is in some kind of trouble. There's no trouble. Someone is sending messages to my phone. To your phone? - Not mine. The bakery's phone. Do one thing. Change the number on the bakery's board. Nobody.. - Nobody.... Nobody does it better. Hey Bobin! - What is it? What are you doing there? Nothing. Give me that phone. Why? - To check if Venad express has left. Venad express has left. That's not possible! Who's she talking to? Hello? Is it Michael Vasanth? - Yes? I'm calling from Guntur near Andhra. Listen, Michael. Your wife Betsy has gotten into some extra marital affair, and has been talking all night to someone, and going around like a mad woman. If you want to save your marriage life, this is your last chance. Bobin, even if you change your voice, I can recognize you. Listen, if you want to ask something to your sister, ask her directly. Don't do this bullshit. - Okay. So it's not him. These are all orders. These are orders. Keep it there. Devil! Betsy, dear.. - Huh? Come here. I'm coming. Check the weight of the second batch. Yeah, I'll check. There was a difference in weight yesterday. Isn't that her purse? Won't let me be decent? Come. Come here. Annamma, cup cakes are running out at the counter. Bring some. The economy is dull. That's why. Don't hurt me. - No. We won't hurt you. Oh God! Slowly! Oh God! Oh Jesus! Oh God! It's over. - Oh God! Oh Jesus! Haven't you taken it? - Yes, it's done. Oh God! Oh God! It's done, right? I have to do it once more. I didn't get any blood. I'll be right back. Hello? Who is this? Can you go there, please? - Hello? Hello? - Just a minute. Who is this? Hello? - It's me, Merin. Merin? Which Merin? The one who studied in MSH. Oh! The one who used to hang out with Jisha in school. From the last classroom? Yes. Hey! Did you call or message to the shop's number recently? Well, I had only that as your number, Bobin. That's why I messaged on that number. Oh! That's my old number. Yes, I got that. I also figured that it's with your sister now. Oh! So you messaged by mistake, right? Has it been long since you joined this diagnostic centre? It's almost a month now. Okay then. - Just a minute. Can we meet tomorrow? What happened? - I have to tell you something. Tomorrow, I am... Bobin spoke to me for the first time, when we went for a tour during High School. The coffee I had in hand spilled on to Bobin's shirt while we were in Thekkady. He shouted at me. He was always very short tempered. Why did you ask me to come? Are you in a hurry? A little bit. I'm going to migrate to Australia. Now? - Not now. Next year. In this Ranni, these jobless Christian guys have a small hobby, and that's migration. Who's this James? - Who is James? When I sent a Whatsapp forward, Betsy replied, 'Is this James?' James? There's no one like that... ... as far as I know. What's your sister's husband's name? - Michael. Do you meet your old friends now, Bobin? Did she send anything else? No. Shall I leave then? I need to go to Erumakkad. Nothing else, right? No. I called you to say this. - Okay then. Hey! Can you do me a favour? What? - Can you message her often? I want to know who this James is. Nothing else. Have the fruit salad. I had only one spoon. Chetta, do you have cream buns? Ask at the next bakery. Why have you kept this shop open then? Do you have a headache? Bro! Huh? What? Come here. - This guy is just showing off. Bro, don't humiliate me. You come here only once a week. They come here daily. It's really tough. See! Might be because you come to the gym daily... You have a 'Jim Carrey' look. Jim Carrey? Who's that? I need to build some more muscles. Come on! Hurry up! Come on! Ten more! Hard! Hard! Encourage me too. - Okay! Come on, hurry up! I hope I can get a six pack before I go to Australia. Delusions while exercising! - Dude! Shall we leave early today? A new English film has released in Upasana theatre. It's full of aliens. All the aliens would be in America, right? No! They would be at Mamukk Junction. Why does Ranni need an alien from outside now? Also, I have a party to attend tonight. The guy who runs Cherupushpam nursery? James of Thadiyoor? He has come from Bahrain. Who? - There will be single malt whiskey. Hey! Which James? Tell me. Do you have his photo with you? Photo? - Yes. - Why do you need a photo? Tell me if you have it. It'd be useful. I don't have his photo. Ugh! It's so heavy! Check, man! - He has a WhatsApp DP. Show me! - You want to see? - Show me. Take it fast. - I'm taking it. Here. See! - Give it to me. Not this one. Not this one. - Not this one? This is James. - No. Do you already know James? - No. But this is not how I imagined James to be. Not this? So he isn't the one who came from Bahrain? [Pastor James Palaykkamannil conducting a prayer meet] James Palaykkamannil? [Priest offering prayers] How did you come? - In my tempo van. So you're not in Australia now? - No. I'm in New Zealand. Is it? - Betsy! See you! Biju? It's been so long since she stepped out and talked to someone like this. There are some changes, after all. That's Biju from Omaloor, right? He's in New Zealand. They are old friends. Looks like they are talking about me. About you? - Yes. Watch! Hey! Where do you work now? At New Zealand. By the way, what does your brother do now? He's planning to migrate to Australia now. Smart boy. It's okay even if it's New Zealand. He's a very good guy. Yes, I've heard so. Can you get him a job at the Indian Embassy there? Even a job at a petrol bunk or supermarket would do. He will be happy anyway. Isn't that your own sister? Yeah, right! She would definitely say all that. Bye. - Bye. Come. - Hi. Hi. Hello? What are you doing? Did Chechi send any message? No. No? Okay then. Wait and watch. He'll call back right away. Hello? - Hello! Hello. Do you sleep early? No. I go to sleep late. I was just asking. I also sleep very late. Oops. What is it? There's a place where we can get some fresh air and nostalgia. You're sleeping here anyway, right? Come. 'Somewhere, far far away' 'My heart has gone, before I knew it' 'I'm singing something today without even singing' 'The breeze is humming along with me' 'Like the full moon rays that appear while I close the door' 'Have you come, in this night?' What is it? 'In this endless rain, showering non stop' 'Your words keep showering, drop by drop' 'Raining endlessly, not speaking a word' 'Not blinking an eye, showering drop by drop' 'In the dark of the night, in the shadow of this lamp' Hello? Don't disturb me, Basil. No, no! Saajan Bakery is not interested in a collaboration with Coca Cola. Yeah, right! As if it will be a huge loss for Coca Cola. 'As the footsteps rise' 'Cosying up in a blanket' 'The heart is beating in a happy rhythm' 'There's a cool cosy feeling within me' Sorry. 'In this endless rain, showering non stop' 'Your words keep showering, drop by drop' 'Raining endlessly, not speaking a word' 'Not blinking an eye, showering drop by drop' 'In dreams... In a thousand dreams' 'I see a fulfilling smile all night' 'Like ripples... within me' 'There's a fervour in my heart while you come to me' 'The heart is beating in a happy rhythm' 'There's a cool cosy feeling within me' 'Far away, out of your sight... Like the wind near me' 'As words whispered in my ears, drop by drop' 'Raining endlessly, not speaking a word' 'Not blinking an eye, showering drop by drop' I have a stomach ache. Oh! We're lucky. It happened right in front of my house. What is it? What happened? Stomach ache! Shall we go to my house? - Stop, Bobin. We'll drop in and go. - Stop! Stop! Hey! Stop! Stop! You go and come back. I have a stomach ache. - It's okay. I'll wait. Shall we go to my house, Merin? It's okay! You can go. - Bad stomach ache. That won't be right, Bobin. You go ahead. You can also come. - No. You can't? - No. You go! Go! You won't come? - No. - I know how to push. Okay! Push! There will be snakes there. That didn't work out. Stomach ache was a bad idea. I should have tried fainting. I'll be right back. O dear Bobin! This always happens to you! I just wished for one kiss! Phew! [Death Penalty] Oh no! Hey! You've been applying that for half an hour. Wash it off. - Doesn't this burn? Of course! I hope he becomes fair at least like that. Dude, how does one get a Padma Shri? You will have to steal it. [Tamil song playing on TV] Though he's stingy, he doesn't hesitate to go drinking. Was all this flooded? What? - Well, are you selling it for half-price? I got it. You want to get it for free. If any customers come, attend to them. Customers? Who else comes here except me? Don't do any hanky panky just because there's no CCTV here. Couldn't you come after a minute? - What? Couldn't you come after a minute? I can't. Merin, can you give me your phone? Aren't you ashamed to do this? Merin, when I wish that my sister should get a good life... I might be called shameless. This is the last time I'm asking for your help. I'm going to send her a Tamil duet song now. Once she listens to that, she'll pack her bags and run away to meet Michael. What's happening? I heard a love song from your room. That's quite unusual. That Tamil song, right? It was a forward message. Tamil song? Who knows? It might be your husband Michael. Where are the Pappadams? - In the store room. You've started listening to Tamil songs? Hello? Throwing attitude, huh? If so? Yeah, right! What are you doing? I'm giving company to Anish Mathew. Anish? - Yes. Just a minute. Please hold on. Where are you now? Why? Tell me. Planning to come here? Should I come? No. Don't come here. Shall we meet tomorrow evening? Okay. - Okay. Hey! One more thing. - What? - Who is this Anish? My colleague Anish. He has fallen sick. Why do you have to be with him for that? Bobin, I'll call you back. - Okay. Do I have fever? Anish! Abhilash! I'll kill all of them! Hello? Did you cure Anish's fever? Bobin, I'm really tired. I'll call you tomorrow. Hey! One minute. What is it? - That Tamil song I sent you? That idea flopped. I don't think she has a good taste in music. My dear Bobin, I heard the song you sent me. Not her. You're the one with a bad taste. That was such a disastrous song. Please. I made a mistake. We'll discuss what we should do next. Betsy should think that Michael is messaging her. That's all, right? - Exactly. You hang up then. Well, I have a slight fever... It's not flexible. That's why I don't keep this in my shop. It's been long since we came here. Now Bobin has brought me here, to ask something else. Has it been long since you came to Pathanamthitta? I came long back, while I was studying. I know. To watch a movie at Anurag theatre, right? He is abroad now, right? The guy who came with you that day? Abhilash? I don't know. My dear Bobin... I swear! I haven't told this to anyone in my life. Still I will tell you. Since such an incident happened in my life that day, it was me who became the happiest. I was dying to watch Hrithik Roshan. That's when we went to watch this movie. By then, people made up their minds that me and Abhilash... ... had come there for some hanky panky. If that was the case, we could have gone somewhere else, right? Because of that, dad sent me away from town for 2 years. So what happened? I lived my life, just like I wanted, over there. I watched good movies, wore clothes I liked.. It was great fun. Well... Don't you have any other job? Still talking about all that? That was very cheap. Well.. I was kidding. In our relationship, I have that freedom, right? So? He thinks he can ask any nonsense? Chechi, bill please. You went to the theatre to watch a movie. We can't do anything about it now. But you shouldn't have gone on the bike. When there are buses and auto rickshaws... Then... when it comes to marriage... I don't like my girl checking for other men's veins, and rubbing here and there after giving injections. That's not such a good feeling. Merin, you know, right? I'm planning to migrate to Australia. I don't think it would happen now. That rascal is over there, right? That Abhilash! How can I go for work confidently, leaving you at home? What if you guys go for a movie? Look how cheap he is! Bobin, stop the bike. - Why? Stop the bike, Bobin. Even my dad is better than this. Get going, Bobin. I'll walk back home. Run! Bobin, will you come with me to Theni tomorrow? Don't tell uncle now. [You should be tied to this pillar and beaten up] [Are you even a human?] 'Whatever this King does, it never goes wrong' 'Whatever this king does, it never goes wrong' [Prayers in progress] [Prayers continue] Hey! Pappachan's daughter has a video phone! It's an android phone, mom. 'Whatever this king does...' Video call? - Hello? Hello? What is it? Your dad is also there? I'm not wearing a shirt. That's okay, Bobin. You needn't wear a shirt. But, in such a circumstance... - Isn't it? Did you have food? I will have food. You hang up! - Don't hang up! Why is she like this? Shucks! He hung up! Rahael! I will call Bobin once more. Hello? Hey! What did you do yesterday? That too, in front of your parents. My parents found out everything. - Found what? They asked me not to stay here anymore. What did you say then? I'm going to Bangalore. Bangalore? What are you doing? We're about to go to Theni to meet Michael. If our plan works out, I'll give you an awesome treat after coming back. We won't meet again, Bobin. We don't have to talk anymore. If it's urgent, can't you go after I come back? No. I'm going today itself. So when will we meet next? Some day! Bye! Hey! You won't get me if you call me on this phone again. Bobin! He will learn only like this. It won't be right if I don't leave now. Merin... Don't talk to me, dad. Shall we go? Is Michael here? - What? Is Michael here? (in Tamil) - Sir is in the office. Hey! I'll go check and come. Betsy? When did you come? Were you sleeping? No. I was just lying down. Have you come alone? - No. Bobin has come with me. How's Bobin? So you're not asking how I am doing? You still smoke? No. It's been long since I quit. Don't you go home nowadays? How is business? Renovation is going on at home. That's why I asked you to come here. Business and all is fine. This new year's harvest was great. So, all good. I don't feel good at all, sitting at home. I feel like I should move somewhere else. Bobin is trying to get me out of the house all the time. He's crazy. So, what have you got planned? You should do something. This year, just like you, I am also... slowly and steadily... I'm trying, you know? We all have to move on, right? Then? Are you into something? Or someone? Hey! I was just kidding. I said it, just like that. Isn't that what both of us wanted? Because we couldn't take it anymore. Eventually, everything will be all right. What happened? So you weren't the one who sent that message to me? What message? I'm sorry. I... I wished at some point... .. that it would be you. What? - I'm sorry. Betsy! Where is Bobin? He's at the farm. So those messages? Don't talk about it again. Even if you say that it was you who sent it, it won't affect me in any way. We both have decided. It's over, Bobin. What's gone won't come back, right? You know? Don't treat her differently. She doesn't want any kind of sympathy. That's not what she wants, Bobin. Okay? Just talk to her normally. This is just a bad phase, and it will be over soon. Dude, get yourself a job, man. If you sit at home jobless, you will lose all respect. Men are created to provide for their families. It's over. Tell Uncle as well. 'The eyes are disappearing, at a distance that can't be seen' 'Even silence is going away slowly' 'Whom are you searching for, in the dark?' 'Whom are these paths waiting for?' 'Forms are changing and disappearing' 'Like an invisible wind, far from my reach' 'O heart, where are you wandering about?' 'O heart, you are going away slowly' 'Like the sorrow of the sky, showering endlessly' 'You are the pain that is sobbing silently within me' 'Always with me, like a lullaby' 'You are waiting like a cloud far away, to rain' 'Waiting every day' 'Drenched in sorrow' 'O heart, where are you wandering about?' 'O heart, you are going away slowly' Bobin bro, it's true that you are elder to me. But what you did was really... Great! This smile of yours when you have no answer? I know what it means. A scoundrel who will go to any length to send his own sister away from home. I'm not saying this because I'm drunk, bro. Or consider that I'm saying this because I'm drunk. You are absolutely selfish. Heard that, you fool? - Fool? Yes, fool. So what? That's mine. - So? Nothing. Are you leaving? - Yes, I'm leaving. You're toxic! Advocate, you stopped? He left. - You and him can have fun! He is leaving angrily. What do I say? Kids these days... ... have no respect for our generation. Hey kiddo! Come here. Isn't there a time to come to an institution? Have you bothered about this bakery after coming back from Theni? Not just me. She also hasn't come, right? So? You won't come here? I've been going berserk here for the past one week. Do you even have some empathy? I've taken care of you since the time you peed in your pants. Show that gratitude at least, you scoundrel. Will you burn me down with your stare? Hey! It's only out of the love and respect towards Saajan and me, that all those shopkeepers are buying stuff from here even now. You've been going up and down this verandah for 5-10 years now, right? Are you even worth a penny? Son... This institution is in your father's name, not mine. Don't make people curse him. Bro! Shelley? - Tell me, dude. I'm waiting downstairs. Will you come downstairs? You wait there. I'll come. I hope he doesn't remember me beating him up behind the Church long back. Bro! Long time! What's happening? - How are you doing, bro? I'm doing good. - What's this unusual visit for? It's a small thing. Will you take some puffs and cake items from our place to your bakery? Bro, are you mocking me? No, dude. - Kozhenchery, Kumbanad, Pullad, Elanthoor We supply to all bakeries in all those places. And to our bakery, we have to get stuff from your lousy Saajan bakery? Yes! - Tell me something that's possible. Dude... It will be a huge help for me if this happens. Things are not going very well now. Will you try talking to your dad? I will talk to dad. That will be difficult. It's okay. I'll manage. But... - What is it? Back in the day, at the Church ground, you.. My dear Shelley... Dude... A Marthomite, should help a Jacobite when he's in trouble. Isn't that what the Bishop has taught us? You haven't forgotten your old tricks, huh? Okay. Call me in the evening. 'I trust in God' Ah! Saajan Bakery! - Hey! Tharakan Achayan has started a new venture. First class, packed... - I'll tell her, son. From Tharakan's farm in Mysore, hand-picked by experts, brewed from first rate Alphonso mangoes... Not brewed. Extracted! Mango juice. Here. Look! Mamba Mango Juice. What a great name! Hey! As an introductory offer, he has promised to give us 250 half liter bottles for free. Per bottle, we'll get 6 Rupees more than our current rate, as well. There won't be any problems for 18 months. How will it have a problem? You must be mixing some potent stuff in it. - What? Ever since you were a child.. - Do you need to say that here? Ever since you were a child, our special item has been lime juice. There's a taste that people here remember. When you say Saajan Bakery, for those who have had lime juice and egg puffs together, it's an emotion in their minds. If you bring this pesticide stuff here, I'll throw it all away. You and your Tharakan! Weren't you arrested for brewing illicit liquor? Achayan is on the path of God now. Yes. How wonderful is God's love, how beautiful is it. Isn't that correct? I'll call uncle. Kiddo, Tharakan sir is leaving. That would be better. Your ideas will shut down this bakery some day. What should I do then? - Then you run this place. I'll go home. Ah! You'll say that immediately! You won't let me sit at the counter... ... or let me migrate either. Devil! She didn't hurt him physically, right? When I am around? Yeah, right! Saying that the cumin soda had less gas, what she did to that Plamoottil Raghu one day. Phew!! She's a psycho! - Well... What happened today? I introduced a new brand so that we can make some profit. From her attitude, it would seem like I was asking her to marry that Tharakan. After all, that bakery belongs to me as well, right? I can also decide what to place on the shelves there, right? What you said is 100% correct. I agree to you in this topic, uncle. Well.. Actually, has this Tharakan stopped brewing illicit liquor? What? The spirit that he makes... Just that it burns our insides a bit. Once we drink it, we'll be on fire from head to toe! That's how.. - This is why Sicily Chechi dumped you. No consistency. What's wrong with him? If you're planning to do business with Tharakan, inform me in advance. I'll go stay at Mercy aunty's house. We won't know when the police would turn up here. If that can get rid of your nuisance, I might start brewing with him! If you come up in life at least like that, I'll buy a chain worth 4 sovereigns of gold for you. Then I'll keep that chain on your chest for your funeral. Hey! Ask this nuisance to shut up! Or I'll smash her on to the wall. Yeah, right! To smash me on to the wall, who are you? Superman? Get lost! Do you have any sense? - It's time to switch on some music. You keep bringing these troublesome guys to the bakery! You should understand something. That bakery belongs to both of us. I'll do whatever I like over there. I'll bring whoever I want. Whom are you to oppose? You're not doing what you like. You will get that bakery to shut down. I'll shut it down, run it, or do whatever I want. Why are you staying here? - This is my house as well. Uncle, make her understand. It's not enough to say you know what to keep in the shelf. You should be in the bakery. You come there only to steal egg puffs. - Are you studying for IELTS? Get lost, you dog! Look at him leaving when he has no answer! Scaredy-cat! - Your husband is the scaredy-cat! What did he say earlier? He'll get me married to Tharakan? Don't open your mouth when required! You keep supporting him! - Praise the Lord! Can you reduce its volume? - No! Get lost, you useless prick! Prick is your uncle! - You bloody frog! Get lost! - I... Come out of your room if you dare. You're lucky that I got a call. Yeah, right! Otherwise? - Hello? Hey! Shall I call you back? Dude, wait. It's something urgent. Tell me, Shelley. Do you guys still make cream buns? Cream buns? I think we stopped it some 10-12 years back. Oh! There goes! My dad and your dad were friends. He's saying that if you guys are still making cream buns, he can try it out. You do something. Make some 5-6 cream buns and go and meet him tomorrow. Cream buns... Do it if you want to. I can't be too involved in this. Hey! I can hear a song there. What's happening? A fight? Can you stop that song? Don't shout in your own house, man! I'll call you back. - Okay. Bobin, there's no rice for you today. Then you'll sleep in the well tonight. Back in the day, Saajan Bakery used to make the best cream buns in town. I've eaten a lot of them during my childhood. Then I don't know why... I haven't seen them much. Maybe they stopped it because demand went down. Sad! Dear, please co-operate. It's for our bakery after all, right? You don't have to beg her, uncle. Showing off so much to make five cream buns in this night? Why do you need raisins? Cream buns don't need raisins. Tell her that we don't need much innovation. An ordinary cream bun will do. Uncle, I had asked him to shut up. Who's talking to you? - Keep quiet. Uncle! From her attitude, it seems like Saajan Bakery invented the cream bun. Uncle, I'll stop this and go. - Stop it and go! Hey! Let her work, or you make it. I'll make it. Then what? She's throwing attitude like she's the only reason why this shop is running. Who else is running it? - You and Betsy. Dear, just because he's mad, if you also start... It's a business he brought, right? Let him make it himself. See you! Let her go if she wants to. Us men can make all this so easily. From YouTube. The MG University of internet. Come on! Let's cook. What is this? Did you make this with chicken shit? Bury every piece of this in the ground. - Uncle! Uncle? You shut up! - But why, uncle? For a moment, I wished in vain that you'll be successful. You and your damn YouTube. You'll never learn! Cream bun, it seems. What? Uncle... Uncle! - Oh! What is it? Shouldn't we deliver the items by 10 AM? Deliver it. I did only one mistake. When Betsy left from here, I stood by your side. Don't make people say that you killed your uncle by feeding him cream buns. It's all for our bakery, uncle. Hey! If Betsy won't come to know... Only if she won't... Shall I say something? Tell me. [Valiya Veedans] Wear it. Hey! Be careful. Go! Go! Hurt my leg early in the morning itself. Him and his damn idea. Will he mess it up? Got the stuff! Let's go! Come on, quick. Give it to me. Hey! Isn't it bad to give them cream buns, bought from their own shop? How is it bad? There's a logic behind everything, uncle. Valiya Veedan would never dislike cream buns from Valiya Veedan's. Got the logic? Now we need to do some manipulations on this. But still, should we? - We should! Get me that casserole. Now watch! Uncle! In modern fraud work, we need utmost discipline and creativity. Two... Three... Four... Five... Now it has a home-made feel, right? Does it? Don't come with this honesty of yours. We need confidence to do this. Confidence! Saajan's son, right? What do you do nowadays? I'm planning to migrate to Australia. Oh! Migration! I know! My elder son is over there. Yellow knife. North-west territory. At the very end. I know. - Didn't you study with Shelley? - Yes. I was asked to make this and bring it here. What is this? - Uncle... Bun... Shall I say the truth? I understood what it is. Though it's made in my company, one can't find such a lousy cream bun in this Kozhenchery town. You know that? Take it. Go! Hey kiddo! Your dad started a bakery, in a small town like Ranni. Before he died, your father was the secretary of the Traders' union in Pathanamthitta. He was in the state committee too. He had gained a good name among people. He had created an impression. What's that called? Honesty! Yes, that's it. Once people die, people remember only such things about them. You may go, son. Uncle... It just happened... It's been long since we made this. What we made yesterday didn't work out. Couldn't you bring that here? Or you should try once more. Do one thing. Try once more. You know why? It's because I saw Saajan's son sitting in front of me, in such a circumstance. Son... You may go. Uncle told me how you got humiliated in front of Benjamin in the morning. He asked me to make some cream buns for tomorrow. Will you help me? Give me the car key. I need to go somewhere. When will you come? Where are you going? Mallappalli. The number you're trying to reach is currently switched off. Please call after some time. [in Kannada] Soniya... These are some photos of yours which I had clicked. [Hindi film playing] I don't think they belong to me now. These are my memories. You can take these photos. Who switched on the mixer? Switch it off. Who's that? - Switch it off. Switch it off! - Break it! Uncle! Uncle, where is she? She hasn't come back yet. When I called her to ask about paying the current bill, she said she was at Mallappalli, at noon. I had told her that I need the car in the evening. There's nothing to eat here or what? I've kept some flattened rice in that little vessel. Take it. Little vessel? This is very little. Can you switch off that mixer? Huh? What did you say? - Nothing. [Flipping through TV channels] Enough! I know the rest. Why didn't you call me back? Where are you? - I am driving. I'll call you. Hey! Don't hang up. I have to ask you something. - Ask! What's your intention? What intention? I am coming back. You know what the time is? What do you think? If you think you can do as you please, that's not possible. Just because I don't ask you anything... you are utilizing that? No wonder he left you! Bobin! What? Come here. Rest we'll talk after you get here. What is your problem? She will come, right? What did she say? What will she say? She won't reach anytime soon. Enough! We don't need any buns or anything. When I'm trying to do something for the shop, she wants to go roaming around. Betsy, where did you go? Couldn't you inform that you'd be late? Uncle, please. Don't ask me anything now. Oh! See! Don't ask her anything, it seems. She shouldn't be allowed into this house. Bobin, don't talk nonsense. You keep quiet. What about the nonsense she's doing? She can do as she pleases with you. Not with me. After roaming around with random guys as long as she wants, I can't go and open the door silently when she comes. My father's name is Saajan. I'll knock your teeth off! Your father Saajan hasn't shouted at me like this. Mind your words! Uncle. He doesn't know if his problem is me going around with random guys, or being humiliated in front of Benjamin sir again. Come, uncle. [Saajan Bakery] Where are you going? - To help her... No. You wait here. Let her make it somehow. You get going. Dear... I'm not asking you where you went. Your problems with Michael... All these years that passed... With all that, I know that you are under a lot of pressure. When your Mommy used to complain about Saajan to me, I could only console her. But that didn't reduce her suffering in any way. I know that what Bobin did to you today, was not right. But that's because he cares for you. Care? My dad got me married to Michael, while he was at Pushpagiri hospital, after his second heart attack. While conducting the wedding without knowing the truth, dad thought... he was fulfilling his daughter's wishes. Even then, no one asked me... ... what my relationship with Michael was. We were good friends, uncle. It took us 10 years after our wedding, to realize that we would always be just good friends. Dad always troubled Mommy in the name of this 'care'. Tolerating my dad and suffering, Mommy left us. Soon, dad also followed her. What I need from my home is not care, uncle. I just want to open up my mind to someone. I have only considered whatever he did so far, as my younger brother's mischief. But the way he's behaving now... I pity him! Saajan and his stubbornness hasn't gone anywhere. Not just his looks, even his character is the same. My father, whom I do not like somewhere or the other. I was watching the CCTV in the morning. To see if you had come there to buy these buns. [Saajan Bakery] What else do you want, son? Can you give me one more cream bun? It does have that old taste. And the cream is amazing. We'll do one thing. We'll keep some buns in our bakery. Let me see if they get sold. I didn't go anywhere near it, so that it doesn't get messed up this time. Betsy made this. - Betsy? - My sister. She has got 'that' from my father. What? Honesty? Culinary skill. If we boil honesty, we won't get this taste, right? Hey kiddo! Wait. What you said right now... You also have it. Do you know that? - Culinary skill? Honesty. I need to go somewhere from this damn house. Hey! My sister. Your mother! My Mary has suffered a lot here. Because of you? - No! No! Your father. He had troubled my dear Mary a lot. Don't bring out that father's same character. Why are you torturing Betsy like this? She is my Mary. I said all that out of a sudden fit of anger. Forgive me. I'll give you one tight slap. Slap me! Your uncle won't slap you. Your uncle won't slap you. Couldn't she pick up my call? I'm the one who's wrong now? Uncle, do you think I'm not sad? After all, she is my own sister, right? Shouldn't I enquire if she has gone out for a long time, late in the night? Hey kiddo! That day, she... She had gone to meet that old guy, James from her college. James? She told that to me today. Which James? Uncle! Don't pass out. Which James? What are you doing? Which James is it? James. - What's his full name? Give me a clue. James. James Bond. You're getting naughtier by the day. James! - Uncle! Uncle! - Nephew! James! I had lied about James to Bobin that day. He had so much attitude when he called me for the first time. 'Are you Merin, who used to hang out with Jisha?' I wasn't hanging out with Jisha. She was hanging out with me. And when he came to meet me? Not even one minute had passed. That buffalo wanted to go to Erumakkad. You! Bobin doesn't trust anyone in this world. Not even his own sister. But I didn't think that this would go into a James Bond zone. Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! What is it? All problems of Saajan Villa will be solved today. I'll solve it. When I come in the evening, you'll be fully surprised. If you're buying a full bottle, Betsy shouldn't know. She'll scold me. Okay then. Bye. - Bye. I am Bobin. Betsy P Saajan's... I had called you. Come in. Well, Mr. James... She has only me. I know that you meet and talk often. She's going through a rough phase now. Everyone needn't think as progressively as us, right? You're not like what Betsy described, Bobin. We both are very close. That's why I came myself to talk about this. I know that she came here to meet you day before yesterday, and that you were together in college. Since you've understood everything... - Let me complete. Since I don't want to approach this in an uncivilized manner, if you are interested... I am talking about your affair with Betsy, James. Or... are you married? I'm not married. By the time I reached this stage looking after my business, a lot of time had passed. Then... Since you're talking so openly, I'll tell you the truth. I'm only happy to have a stepmother like Betsy. And an uncle like you, Bobin. So James? - He's my father. He was a Professor. Now he's retired. Since it has been around 16 years since my mom died, Betsy would be a great company for dad, in this old age. It was my dad who taught history to Michael and Betsy in college. I wasn't aware of that history. I knew it from the beginning that you came here without knowing anything. Betsy and Michael have been thinking about divorce for long. They came here to meet my dad, to discuss about that, day before. They have taken a decision as well. Before jumping the gun, if you had spoken privately for 5 minutes to your own sister, did you have to be embarrassed by coming here like this? - No. I'm not embarrassed. Admit it, dude. Who's that? Are they people asking for donations? No! It's a marriage proposal for you from Ranni, dad. When did you come? What I said the other day... Do you have something else to say? I'm not feeling good. Then don't say anything. Then... ... you say something. I have also gone through such situations in which I didn't feel good. We don't feel like talking to anyone about it then. Even if there's nothing to say, it's good to have someone with us. And your behaviour is like the bun we make... It will get expired in two days. Be it happiness or sorrow, your feelings last only that much. Only the bun would know the tension it goes through, for those two days. It doesn't know if it would expire, or if someone would dip it in tea and eat it. Hello? Bobin, it's me. Yes, uncle. I have your number. Hey! I don't think they would get sold. People are not buying it. Uncle, can you keep it for some more days? I've kept it, kiddo. But no one's buying it. People don't like the old cream bun now. It's shape is so round and... Okay then... Can you at least lock this shop, son? 'A river is born on this earth' 'The moment streams join' 'From flowing in two different paths, to flowing together' 'Together, even if the seasons change' Hey!

Awesome shape. Try it. 'Then, now and forever, this place is our own, o dear heart' 'You and I are like day and night' Merin, do you like Upma (food item)? Did you say something, Josh Prakash? Well, I have brought Upma today. So? Well, since it got burnt a little, shall we eat out? Won't that be good? No, Josh. True. Why should I waste the Upma? Bobin is coming to meet me today. He's planning to surprise me. But he has put up a status on Facebook. Fool! 'Then, now and forever, this place is our own, o dear heart' 'You and I are like day and night' 'Then, now and forever, this place is our own, o dear heart' 'You and I are like day and night' 'Then, now and forever, this place is our own, o dear heart' 176. 176 calls. More than 40 messages. Forwards too. Did you reply to even one of them? I want to know. Merin, what is this? Did you come all the way here to say this? - Yes. I'm not planning to let you go. I've come with clear cut decisions. When are you coming to Ranni? I'll call the security. - Do you have badminton socks? 3rd stand. What? - I can get socks in Ranni too. Hey! I'm not able to concentrate. I'm not able to focus on my business either. Merin, when I am alone... When you're alone? - I'm really sad. Am I not sad? But I'm not switching on my phone, right? That's exactly my problem. Will your problem be solved if I switch on my phone? - You should pick it up too. I won't. This is what... You have no intention of being better? - Don't say that. Then what should I say? Bad luck, Josh. Bad luck! What I said that day, was out of a frustration. I know that I was not politically correct. But now I am better. A change was really necessary for me. So I've been watching feminist movies off late. - Big deal! Didn't you go for any movie after coming here? Get lost! - I didn't mean anything else. Merin, wait. - Bobin, leave my hand. Leave my hand, Bobin. - Did you see the movie 'Thappad'? In that... Why did you slap me now? - I hate you. Nothing is in its place here. Uncle! Where's the nail cutter? Nail cutter! Find it yourself. You're quite old now, right? Don't cut nails in the night. - Get lost. He wants a nail cutter at midnight. Hello? - Where's your nail cutter? What? - Nail cutter. Check in my bathroom. - I checked there. Check properly. Check again! I'll check. Learn to listen to me first. Or don't bother asking. There's nothing here. Here... It's here. See! Who's the fool now? No. Not me. Instead of troubling me asking for your underwear and nail cutter, why can't you take care of yourself? What happened after you spoke to Merin's dad? Will it happen? After all our fights, if there's any love left, we'll see next year. Nothing else. We need to understand each other much more, before bringing her here. That's what she also wants. So my kid brother has learned to be responsible. Get lost. Okay then. - Hey! Hey! Since I'm not there, are the uncle and nephew boozing daily? A little. Okay. I won't drink again. Forgive me.
