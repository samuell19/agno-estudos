Begging your pardon, sir? I beg your pardon, sir! What's that? Really! Jeeves, what did you turn the music off for? I'm sorry to trouble you, sir, but the neighbors are complaining again. Oh, dash the neighbors! Oh, Jeeves, I'm so tired of this boring inactivity. - I need a new adventure. - Remembering your past adventures, sir... I fail to share in your enthusiasm. Oh, first the neighbors complain and now you, Jeeves. I'm not like ordinary people. I need excitement. If I may make the suggestion, don't you think you'd better relax? I've been relaxed for three weeks and look at me now? reduced to pounding the pedal of a bass drum for a little excitement. Oh, remember your nerves, sir. Yes, that's right, Jeeves. I'm a bundle of unhappy, unsatisfied nerves. I feel it my duty to point out to you... that your escapades have begun to affect you physically. What nonsense, Jeeves. I've never been stronger in my life. Look, I'll show you. Yes, sir. Pardon me. You see, that's the danger, sir. All serious ailments are preceded by a false feeling of physical fitness. Well, Jeeves, that's very good on paper. Well, what do you suggest? - Allow me, sir. - Oh, thank you. I would recommend a quiet, peaceful spot in the country. Ah, the country. Yes, Jeeves. But not a quiet, peaceful spot. Jeeves, don't you understand? I need a stimulant. - Quite, sir. - Oh, yes. Thank you. - Jeeves, there was a bird who knew the great adventure. - Undoubtedly, sir. To my ancestor, Sir Bertram? gallant soldier, great lover and the soul of chivalry. - No doubt, Jeeves, you've noticed the family resemblance. - Many times, sir. Thank you. Better now, sir? There, there. Thank you. Ah, to have lived in those days of romance. I've got it, Jeeves. We're going to Deauville in search of the great adventure. But I'm not ready for the great adventure, sir. I want to live a little longer. In view of this, sir, I feel I must give my notice. - Notice? Jeeves, am I hearing correctly? - Yes, sir. You mean you're considering leaving my entourage? Only with the deepest regret, sir. - Then don't be an idiot. Why leave? - Sir, to tell you the truth... your romances have given me, as well as you, a severe case of nerves. Jeeves, what romances? Do you remember a lady named Lola we met in Madrid... and her brother, the knife thrower? Yes, I do remember vaguely. I have better cause to remember, sir. It was my coat his knife pinned to the back door. Jeeves, you can't complain about that. I got you a new coat, didn't I? Oh, quite, sir. Then there was that woman in Algeria. - Yes, she was sort of dark. - Roast beef, rather well done, sir. - Jeeves, I remember something. - Perhaps about her father who surprised us, sir. - Yes, an irritable egg. - Fortunately a bad shot... or I might otherwise have permanently resided in Algeria. But, Jeeves, all these are mere indiscretions of youth. - After all, I didn't marry any of the ladies. - Quite, sir. But as you're contemplating further adventure... I feel I must leave you in the morning. Very well then. Leave, dash it. Is there anything else you desire, sir? Well, you can take all those drums away. I'm not allowed to play them anymore. Very good, sir. - Who do you wish to see, madam? - Oh, excuse me! Excuse me! Please close the door. Close it. Hurry! - Anything the matter, madam? - May I see your mistress? - My mistress, madam? - Yes, Madam Wooster. This is her home, isn't it? This is the residence of the Honorable Bertram Wooster. There is no Madam Wooster. Of course, how foolish of me. It completely slipped my mind. - May I see Mr. Wooster, please? - Mr. Wooster, madam, is not at home. - Oh. Then I'll? I'll wait in here. - Sorry, miss. - But you can't wait here. - Why do you say I'm not at home when you know I am? - Hello. How are you? Won't you come in and? - Yes, thank you. - Can I give you a little whiskey and soda or something? - Just some tea, please. That'll be all, Jeeves. Just bring a little tea. I'll park the portmanteau for you. Won't you sit down? I'd better take this coat that's all wet. Get that dried off for you. Here we are. And that ridiculous little hat. Get a footstool and put your feet up. - Get your shoes off because I know they must be wet. - Oh, that's so good of you. Can't let you get pneumonia, you know. I didn't mean to tickle you. Just wanted to see your socks weren't wet. It's so good seeing you again. Yes, isn't it? Where did we meet before? At Brighton. Your brother introduced us. My brother? At Brighton? Oh, yes, my brother at Bri? Have you seen him lately? - Seen who lately? - Well, my Brighton brother. Oh, your?your brother. Yes. Well, what about him? - Well, how is he? - Oh, splendid, splendid. Well, that is good news. I'll go and get those things dry. You just stay there. Now, don't run away. I'll be back in just a minute. - Jeeves, our trip is off. - I beg your pardon, sir? Why go to Deauville when romance is here in my own house? Isn't she lovely? Do you happen to know the young lady's name, sir? - What's in a name? A rose by any other smell? - Yes, I remember the quotation. - Take this funny little thing. - Where shall I put it, sir? - I don't know. Dry it. Do something with it. - Yes. - Jeeves, have I got a brother? - Brother? Certainly not, sir. I thought not, but one never can tell these days, can one? - And, Jeeves, have I ever been to Brighton? - Never, sir. It's too bad. Lot of people are very nice in Brighton. Undoubtedly, sir, yes. Well, old thing, the tea will be ready in just a minute. Oh, my goodness. Oh, dear. Shh. She's asleep, Jeeves. It's getting rather late. Don't you think we ought to wake her up? - Never wake anybody up when they're asleep. - Very well, sir. Is there anything else, sir? Don't you think she'd be more comfortable if she were undressed? You must excuse me, sir, but I'm a gentleman's gentleman. Yes, rather. - Well, good night, Jeeves. - Good night, sir. Hello? Hello? Give me the toll operator, please. Yes. Hello, toll operator? I want Mooring 3-7. Yes, it's the Mooring Manor Hotel. Do hurry. It's very important. Oh, well, perhaps Jeeves knows best. - Mooring Manor Hotel. - I want to speak to Mr. McDermott, please. Mr. McDermott? Hold the line, please. - Yes. - There's a lady calling from London for Mr. McDermott. All right, connect her with him and I'll listen in. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Here's Mr. McDermott. Hello? Hello, Marjorie. I say, nothing's happened? You're all right? You've got your half of the plans safe? Yes, but I was being followed, so I had to take cover. I'll get out of here as soon as I can. What room are you in? Number 16. Now do take care of yourself. I will. I'll let you know the moment I arrive. Good-bye. We'll take that! Come on. Come on! Come on! Hand it over! - Morning, Jeeves. Good morning. - Good morning, sir. And thank you very much for taking such good care of me last night. - I'm glad you slept well, sir. - I slept well and safely. But where's the young lady? - I'm happy to say she departed, sir. - You mean she's gone? - 3:32 precisely. - Where did she go? I didn't feel it my place to ask, sir. Why didn't you wake me up? After all, I was the host. The mysterious young lady asked she be permitted to leave without the formalities. And what were you doing up at 3:32, may I ask? Helping her out through the servants' quarters, sir. Here I have the most beautiful girl in all England in my own house... and you let her get away from me. - You're most exasperating. - I shan't be for long, sir. Yes, that's true, isn't it? Jeeves, have you ever heard of the Mooring Manor Hotel? It was formerly in the possession of the Viscount Mooring, whom my father served. When the family had reverses, it was sold and converted into a hotel. - What sort of a place is it? - Charming, sir. Surrounded by a beautiful countryside. - An ideal spot for rest and quiet, if I may say so. - Of course you may say so. Jeeves, go off and pack my bags. I'm going to the Mooring Manor Hotel. I had packed your bag in anticipation of Deauville, sir. I'm glad you've changed your mind. I feel sure you won't regret it. Yes, I hope not. Well, you beetle off and get those things now. And breeze along. Don't trip over anything. It's been cold waiting here all night. I hope Burton got your telephone message. I could do with some tea. Here he comes now. - Hello, Tom. Hello, Jack. - Well, Burton. - Cold? - You're welcome. I got your telephone message and I brought you some tea and some sandwiches. - Just what we need. - Let me have that. I say, look. There's something going on here. A girl goes into that house. She stays there. Then two men come out who appear to be going on a little trip. What's this bright light, Jeeves? The sun probably, sir. Come on. We're taking no chances. Burton, stay here and watch for that girl to come out. Tom and I will follow that car. # Drink, puppy, drink And let every puppy drink # #That is old enough to lap and to swallow # # For he'll grow into a?# How's the rest of that thing go, Jeeves? With my apologies, sir. # For he'll grow into a hound # # So we'll pass the bottle round And merrily we'll # Whoo! #And we'll hollow # # Here's to the horse and the rider too of course # #And here's to the scent that they follow # #And here's to the pace that puts life into the chase as merrily we # Whoo! #And we'll hollow # # So drink, puppy, drink And let every puppy drink # #That is old enough to lap and to swallow # # For he'll grow into a hound So we'll pass the bottle round and merrily we'll # Whoo! #And we'll hollow ## I think we harmonize most admirably, Jeeves. - A great deal better than most music hall teams I've heard. - Thank you, sir. If I may say so, sir, you're showing a marked improvement already. - Do you really think so? - Most decidedly, sir. Thank you, Jeeves. Coming from you, that is a compliment. Sorry, sir. Good heavens, sir! - What's the matter? - Look, sir! - What on earth's that object? - Looks like a scarecrow to me, sir. Don't be ridiculous. Scarecrows don't carry saxophones. You can't stand there. Don't you realize you're obstructing traffic? - Who's doing what? - Go away now. Go on. Shoo. Shoo. - I can't. I's too tired. - Where were you pointing? I was pointing to where I was going, if anybody would take me there. - Where are you going? - I was going to Leeds. Oh, would you mind telling me what you're doing with that zither? that thing there? I's a saxophoner in the Dixieland band. We was supposed to play in Leeds tonight. - But I's all missed the bus we rides in. - Aren't the trains running? Yes, sir, trains running for them that got the fare. Stop this debating, Jeeves. Put it in the back. - Get in the back there, will you? - Yes, sir. Now hurry up and get in-between those bags. I think he's all right now, sir. You can drive off. I never expected to find a bit of band on the road. We ought to get together some time for a concert. I'm a musician myself. What do y'all play? Well, I am considered quite a virtuoso on the drums. - Ain't that so? Can y'all swing it? - Oh, yes. Swing what? You know, swing it on out there. - Now do you understand, Jeeves? - Quite, sir. Ain't y'all never heard of swing music? - What on earth is this swing music? - I'll show you. I'll riffle off a couple of notes for you. - Well, that's not bad, Jeeves. - Not good, sir. Well, it's barbaric, but definitely intriguing. - Remind me to go in for this business of swinging. - Yes. I know that got you, boss. I'll riffle off a couple more for you. Really, please! Must you? Begging your pardon, sir. I think we're being followed. - I'll pull away from them. This is exciting. - Quite, sir. Go on. Get them! I think it advisable that we stop, sir! Nonsense, Jeeves. Are we rabbits or Englishmen? We can't give ourselves up to those thieves without a struggle. Them ain't rabbits chasing us. Here, here! This is neither the time nor the place to shave yourself! Put that thing away! Doggone. I never expect to see me here again. I suggest that we stop, sir, or you may get seriously injured. Jeeves, I never enjoyed myself so much in my life. Besides, you got me into this and it's up to you to get me out again. Boss, excuse me. Can I get off here? No, we're going to make a turn. I think we hit an air pocket there. Them trees got us surrounded. Stay away, trees! Well, we seem to have lost them now, Jeeves. Yes. Begging your pardon, sir. I think they're coming down the side road. Oh, yes, so they are. Where did they go? Road hogs, Jeeves. Go on! Get them! I'll cut them off at the crossroads. There we are, Jeeves. If I'd taken your advice and stopped... we'd probably all have been slaughtered by now. - Maybe they weren't thieves, sir. - Nonsense. They weren't chasing us to borrow a match. Perhaps they don't smoke, sir. There's them men again. - Persistent fellows, sir. - Yes. Well, good-bye, Jeeves. - Get out, please. - But I just got in. - I wish you'd go away and not molest us. - What is the meaning of all this? - You mind your own business. - Oh, rats! - I'll trouble you to be less discourteous. - Very well. Mice. We're from Scotland Yard. Would you mind getting out, please? Scotland Yard? We thought you were thieves. That is funny, Jeeves. Most amusing, sir. But I suppose we'd better obey them. Now then, would you mind telling me where you're going? We're going to the Mooring Manor Hotel. Is anything wrong? - And may I ask what your purpose is in going there? - Allow me, sir. My master is in need of a quiet and peaceful holiday. I see. Where are those papers that girl gave you? Jeeves, you've been holding out on me. I didn't know you had a girl. I haven't, sir. To what young lady are you referring, sir? You know the one we mean. She spent the night in your flat. - Did you have a girl in the flat? - No, sir. I think he's referring to the lady who dropped in on us so mysteriously last night. We're referring to the young lady who calls herself Marjorie Lowman. So that's her name. What about her? She has stolen papers which are of vital importance to the government. - I know nothing about it. Did she give me any papers? - No. There you are. You're wrong. She just popped in and popped out again. - Nevertheless, we shall search you. - I understand. - A matter of formality. - Thank you. Better search him first. - He may be an accomplice. - I ain't no accomplice. I's American. Oh. Are you interested in swing music? - No. - Oh, just a thought. May I point out that I'm rather sensitive in that portion of my anatomy? - Just hold still a moment. Nobody's going to hurt you. - Thank you. They're not carrying it. Let's go through their bags. - This way, madam, please. - Thank you. I believe you've got some rooms for me. I'm Marjorie Lowman. Oh, yes, we've been expecting you, Miss Lowman. Will you register, please? Yes. Thank you. Will you tell Mr. McDermott I've arrived and would like to see him? - Who, miss? - Mr. Edward McDermott. - We have no one by that name stopping here. - But you have. I spoke to Mr. McDermott myself over the telephone last night. He's in room 16. Pardon me, but I'm in room 16. My name is Elliott Manville. Oh, I'm sorry. There must be some mistake. - I thought that was Mr. McDermott's room. - No, that's my room. Your friend is probably staying somewhere else. Have you tried the Village Inn? No, but I telephoned him last night. Most extraordinary. Are you quite certain that you haven't a gentleman named Edward McDermott stopping here? - Absolutely. - Then how could I have spoken to him? - It's beyond me, miss. - I'm certain there's nothing to worry about. Go up to your room and make yourself comfortable. And meanwhile, I'll scout around and see if I can find your Mr. McDermott. - You must think this very stupid of me. - Not at all, not at all. Your friend must surely be around here somewhere. I'll try and find him, and then give you a ring in your room. - Thank you so much. - It's all right. - Where's Manville? - In his office. Well, what have you got to say for yourselves? - We didn't get the plans. - Yes, go on. We trailed the girl, but she ran into a house occupied by a Bertie Wooster. We waited all night but didn't see her come out. This morning Wooster appeared with his man, got into their car and we followed them. - Go on, go on. - We stopped them on the road... posed as Scotland Yard men and searched them but they didn't have the plans. They're coming here and that's why we hurried ahead to warn you. Yes, Mr. Manville? If Mr. Bertie Wooster arrives, let me know immediately. So you followed the two men, forgot all about the girl, eh? No, we left Burton there to watch the house. He's going to have a long wait because I happen to have the lady in this hotel. - What? - I met her when she arrived and arranged to have lunch with her. She thinks I'm going to help her find Mr. McDermott. Now listen. This is what I want you two to do. And let there be no slipup this time. Go to her room and make a thorough search of everything. - We will. - Just a moment. And keep an eye on that Wooster fellow. That's all. - All right. - I'll see you later. That's not bad, Jeeves. We did the last mile in exactly one minute and 12 seconds. Begging your pardon, sir. I think that's inaccurate. One minute and 11 seconds. Oh. Oh, this is a wonder spot, Jeeves. I bet this reeks with romance. - I hope not, sir. - Yes. Anyway, it's a nice place for rest and quiet. I consider it the most peaceful spot in the whole of England, sir. Good egg, Jeeves, good egg. I? I wonder what's happened to our passenger. That Ethiopian fellow seems to have evaporated. You'll probably find him down the road, sir, draped on a bush. Do something about it because it worries me exceedingly. I'll go and have lunch. Yes, sir. Hello! Hello! Yes, sir, Massa Gabriel, I's coming. - Us plays the horn too. - Well, come on. Come, come. We're there. - Where? - Here! - Ain't I in pieces? - You're as right as right can be. Will y'all give me your word I ain't dead? Come on, come on. Get out of the car and buzz off. Is us in Leeds? Leeds is many miles from here. - How we gonna get there? - Walk. Feet, did y'all hear what that man said? - When my man appears, send him up with my luggage, will you? - Very good, sir. Show Mr. Wooster to his room. This way, sir. Mr. Wooster just arrived. I've given him room nine. Good. Keep me informed of everything he does. I'm Mr. Wooster's man. What room shall I take his things to? - Mr. Wooster is in room nine. - Thank you. - What's the matter, old man? Don't you feel well? - I'm very well, thank you. - Have you got wasps in this hotel? - Wasps? Of course not. - I feel certain I've been stung. - Possibly your imagination. Possibly, but not probably. - I'll carry that for you for two bits. - Two bits of what? That's a quarter? 25 cents American money. No, thank you. I don't need your aid. What an extraordinary language. Two bits! Well, Jeeves, you were right again. Right again, Jeeves! - This is a beautiful spot. - It was, sir. - What do you mean, "It was"? - I regret to report that that woman is here. - Woman? What woman? - Our visitor of last night. Oh, that one. Well, that is a coincidence. An extraordinary coincidence, sir. May I suggest for your own good... that we motor on till we come to another hotel? Definitely not, Jeeves. I refused to have my rest interfered by a mere female. Frankly, I'm afraid, sir, that we may get involved in another embarrassing situation. This is different. Remember what those Scotland Yard men told us about this girl? It is our duty to remain here and watch her... in case the occasion arises to aid our country. Yes, sir. I find your patriotism most admirable, sir. Then you haven't been able to find Mr. McDermott? No, not yet. I'm sorry. - I hope nothing's happened to him. - No, I don't think so. If you tell me where you found him and about what time... it might help to clear things up. It was quite late. I was staying with my aunt in London. Oh, I? I see. I'm beginning to think we should notify the police. No, no, no. That won't be at all necessary. Suppose we take a little drive this afternoon and make further inquiries. - I guess we'll learn something. - Hello, hello! How are you today? Why did you run away? - Sorry. I don't think we've met. - Nonsense. Of course. - You spent last night with me. - This lady says she doesn't know you. Yes, she does. You mustn't forget old friends so soon. Most unflattering. I haven't the slightest idea who you are. You can't have forgotten Brighton and my brother. - Never been to Brighton. - Well, makes us even. I haven't a brother. You're evidently making a mistake. This lady spent last night with her aunt. Don't you think you ought to apologize and leave us? Well, if that's the way you see it, I'll toddle off and give it thought. I say, what's that dreadful thing you're playing? - They call it "The March of the Hussars. " - Nothing like it. It so happens, my bovine friend, that "The March of the Hussars" is my favorite piece of music. I know every note of it, and you haven't played one of them. Well, how does it go then? Those are the drums. Play it. Those are the trumpets. Play it. - Will you have a cigarette? - No, thank you. - Will that be all, sir? - Yes, that's all. Thank you. You do that again and I'll take you across my knee. Well, are you ready? Thanks. Well, thanks very much for lunching with me. - I'll call for you in about an hour. - Thank you too. - I'll see you later. Good-bye. - Good-bye. - Oh, just a moment! - What do you want? I'm in a hurry. I wouldn't annoy Miss Lowman again if I were you. What right have you to interfere? Are you a relative? - No. - Then I have just as much right... to speak to her as you have, old boy. Nevertheless, I'm warning you. If you interfere with her, you'll get into trouble. Oh, I see then. You're one of these government fellows. Clever aren't you? Well, just keep away from her. We Woosters never get enmeshed in the official dragnet. - No? - Oh, no. Now, then, play the whole thing through and play it properly. Yes, sir. Left.! Left.! Left, right, left.! No, no, no! That's where we go... down! - Oh, it's you again. - Yes, I thought it only courteous... to return your visit of last night. - May I come in? Thank you very much. - What do you want? I just want to talk. If you'll overlook this informal visit... I'll forgive you for slighting me in the dining room. - Spicy little spot you have here. - I wish you wouldn't follow me. I'm not following you. As much as I'd like to, I'm not following you. I'm here to do you a good turn? and at the risk of my life too. Oh! Very inefficient. I think you'd better go. I've had just about enough of this nonsense. Have you got a license for that machine? You could be put in jail. I was quite aware of that, but don't come any closer. I can't help it. You're so irresistible. - Please don't come near me. - Would you point that thing away? There you are. You go backwards, you fall on your back. - Give me that gun. - I get these bullet things out, I'll be comfortable. Now you can point it at me all day if you like. - Just why did you come here? - Well, I-I? Marjorie? You don't mind me calling "Marjorie," do you? Of course you don't. Marjorie, why don't you give up this life of yours? You're far too young and beautiful to spend it in jail. - What do you take to get these delusions? - You're wrong. - I'm doing this for your own good. Now let's sit down. - Leave my coat alone. - I'll hang it up for you. - Please, give it to me. Give it to me. - I won't drop it. - Now, please go. Dash it! I can't go until I do the thing I came here to do. Why don't you give up this life you're leading. It's not going to get you anywhere. Oh? That's most flattering. But just what do you think I am? You can stop all this bluff because I happen to know you've borrowed some plans... that belong to the government, and I think it only sporting to tell you... that a large number of detectives are following you around. - Now I know there's something wrong with you. - Don't go on pretending. Two Scotland Yard men followed you to my house yesterday. - Really? - That's why they stopped and searched me on the road. - They told me all about you. - That must have been most interesting. Most instructive. I saw the same two in your room when you were having lunch. - You did? Why didn't you stop them? - I thought it over. One can't monkey about with Scotland Yard men. I tried to tell you while you were having lunch but you fortunately stopped me. Why was that fortunate? Because the man you were having lunch with was another government chap. He threatened to shoot me if I so much as look at you. Thank you for telling me this. And, now, if you'll excuse me, I won't keep you any longer. I'm in no hurry. I haven't come to the most important thing yet. Don't tell me there are more detectives on my trail. There probably are, hundreds. Black with them, for all I know. I must give you one word of advice. Will you give back those plans? Get whatever it is you've stolen... and we'll trickle down together and just see those detectives. - You're out of your mind. - I'm not. I just love you, that's all. In fact, if you'll reform, I'll willingly consider marrying you. - I suppose I should feel flattered. - You certainly should. I don't propose to every girl I meet. Now put on your coat. - Please leave my coat alone. - Why? - Because I say so. - Anything you say, my dear. I don't understand why you want to go on leading this unhappy life. I was perfectly happy until you came. You're pretending again. I know very well you're fond of me. You're just fighting to cover it up. It must be wonderful to be gifted with so much insight. Well, it's very nice, but will you promise to send back those plans? They'll be in government hands by tomorrow morning. There. I knew you were a woman of intelligence the moment I set eyes on you. Sort of a like recognizing like. Thank you. Now, please excuse me. I really have some things to attend to. - Can't I stay here and help? - No, no. Thank you. Really. - Will you have dinner with me tonight? - Yes, of course I will. But, now, please, excuse me and? - Thank you. - You really are a bit of a darling. - That's nice of you to say so. - I'm not bad myself. As a matter of fact, I'm considered pretty crisp, in a manly sort of way. - You'll probably find that out when we get better acquainted. - No doubt. Good-bye. Well, good-bye, my puppet. - Come on. Keep moving. - Fancy meeting you here. Why don't you come in, sit down, put your feet up? - Hand over those plans. - I've told you, I haven't got any plans. - Talking won't get us anywhere. - How are you? - Let's search him. - You've searched. Don't you remember? I was down the road, my valet with me and some colored gentleman. Yes, we remember. I suppose the girl didn't give you those plans just now? That's right. She didn't. How did you guess? - Oh! We're wasting time. - If you insist, I'm only too glad to help. - Never mind. We'll take care of it. - No offense, old boy. Well, what did you intend to do with these cartridges? Cartridges? Yes, they are cartridges, aren't they? I'm rather fond of shooting? Grouse shooting, to be precise. - That's why I came down here. - With a revolver? What do you expect me to bring, a fishing rod? I suppose you know that grouse shooting starts in August. For your information, this happens to be the 17 th of May. The old calendar does whip around, doesn't it? I just wanted to get a little practice before the grouse shooting started. Don't you practice before grouse shooting? Very tricky birds. I feel you won't need these, so I'll take care of them. - That is, if you don't mind. - Not at all. I'm delighted... that you government fellows would take them for me. What a nice hat that is. Now, if you two gentlemen wouldjust be patient... I'm quite sure everything will be straightened out by tomorrow. - What do you mean? - I can't take you into my confidence. You'll just have to trust your old friend Wooster. You see, I have decided to take over Miss Lowman's interest permanently. - Do you mind telling us what you're talking about? - Not at all. It's a pleasure. I have persuaded Miss Lowman that a life of dishonesty never did pay. I never could bear a thief at any price. However, she's an exception. - We know that. - Is he pulling our leg? - He's up to something. - I am, but it's a secret. However, you may tell your superiors? I take it you have superiors? Tell them they need worry no more. That which they are seeking will be placed... in their hands tomorrow and you may add that Bertram Wooster will see to it. - Do you know what he's driving at? - Sounds balmy to me. Well, let's go. No need to wait here any longer. He hasn't got the plans. - We'll see you later on. - Splendid.! Splendid, old boy.! I look forward to it. Might have a spot of lunch at the club one day. And don't forget to give that message to your superiors. I know they'll be relieved to hear that. Good morning. I tell you the girl must have them on her. They weren't in her room and she didn't give them to Wooster. Why not let us go up and get her? There's no use in being diplomatic. From now on, you two keep away from her. - I'll handle this in my own way. - If that's the way you want it. - Remember, this girl is clever. - That's why I propose to take care of her myself. I'm going to meet her in the lobby and then take her to the private garage. - What about that Wooster? - You don't need worry about him. We'll take care of Mr. Wooster after we've got the girl. And, remember, we can't afford to fumble this time. I've wired the chief in Paris that I'll be with him tomorrow. Here, you'd better put these in the safe until we get the other half. I'll take that, Mr. Manville. And now, what have you done with McDermott? - If you'll give me those plans, I'll tell you. - Don't move. Don't panic. She can't hurt you with that. It isn't loaded. - What? - I took the precaution of removing the pellets. Which I thought was clever. I'm more than a little offended... - at you not keeping your promise. - You fool! I say, handle her with care. She's most precious. - Sit down, Wooster. - Thank you. I am dripping with fatigue. - Won't you sit down? - You may as well, Miss Lowman. You may be here for quite a while yet. You park on the plush and I'll come and look after you. - There you are. - Idiot! Don't say things like that. I only did what I did for your own good. - If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to Miss Lowman. - Not at all. Lovers quarrel. - Keep quiet, Wooster, and sit down! - Oh, thank you very much. Get me a chair, will you? I'll get one myself. Mustn't strain the arm of the law. Now, Miss Lowman, you'll save yourself a lot of trouble... if you'll hand over the other half of those plans. - I don't know what you're talking about. - You know that isn't true. Why don't you give him whatever he wants for my sake? They'll arrest you if you don't. Arrest me? Why, he's the thief. Don't say things like that. These people are police. You'll make them angry. You keep out of this, Wooster. Come, Miss Lowman. I happen to know that you arranged to meet McDermott here... and turn over the rest of the plans to him. - Now you're being ridiculous. - And I also know... that McDermott arranged to turn over his plans to the Faulkner Aircraft company. Oh, really? That's quite near here. Just go down the road. - Thank you very much for the information. - Oh, no charge, old boy. - So, you see, your pretense won't work, Miss Lowman. - You might as well confess. - Are you going to give them up or must we take them? - I've said all I'm going to. Very well then. Go on. Search her. I can't allow you to manhandle the lady. - Sit down, jack-in-the-box. - I've had just about enough of you, Mr. Wooster. This isn't cricket. If you want to search, have a matron here. Search me. Wooster, if you interfere again, it'll be for last time. Here, take this. Very touchy on this "blowpipe" question. Is that regulation? I didn't know you government chaps carried those things. Just beginning to filter through the Wooster brain that you're not government chaps. An amazing piece of detective work, Mr. Wooster. Here, sit down. What are you doing? - Boss, you all right? - I don't know yet. From now on I shall hate "The March of the Hussars. " Oh, we can't get out there. Let's try here. Now, come on. Come on. Hurry up now. I'm sorry to have messed this up. I had no idea these people were thieves. It seems you had no idea of anything. If it hadn't been for you, these men would be in the hands of the police. - I'd do anything on earth to make amends. - It's too late now. - I'm not so sure. - They match perfectly. - These are the complete plans. - Well, I'm ready to leave. What the? - What's that? - Somebody playing games, probably. They've got the plans. Call everyone in the place. Stop them! - Mr. Wooster, sir. - Jeeves, what are you doing here? - Just exploring? - We've been duped. This girl is not a thief. - Really? - Take charge of the situation. Jeeves.! Jeeves.! - I beg your pardon, sir. - Nice work, Jeeves. I'm a little bit rusty for a former amateur champion. That's better. Allow me, sir. - Splendid! Splendid, Jeeves. - Thank you, sir. There they are! After them! - Jeeves! Two more coming up! - Very good, sir. - Good luck, Jeeves. - Thank you, sir. Faster! - I'm sorry about all this. - Yes, I know, but we've got to get out of here. Downstairs, quick! Stop them! - Jeeves! Two more on the ice. - What? Again, sir? Go on! Get 'em! - "Alone stood the brave Horatius?" - "But constant in mind. " - "30,000 foes before?" - "And the broad flood behind. " "'Down with him.! 'cried false Sextus. " "With a smile on his pale face. " "'Now yield thee,' cried Lars Porsena. " "'Now yield thee to our grace. "' - Oh, go away.! - Here, here! You can't do that, old man. Let go, you! Oh, you! You bully you! You great big brute.! You bully you.! You brute.! Let go of me, you brute.! Let go of me.! - No. Come on. - Let go of me! Really! You men cover the back. You come with me. You're under arrest! - Marjorie, are you all right? - Yes, I think so. But where have you been? Locked in a garage. Had to dig my way out. I got here as soon as I got the police. Where are the plans? - Mr. Wooster has them. - Wooster? Who's he? A friend of mine. Well, where is he? - Oh, he's gone! - Gone? Yes, he was downstairs? or maybe they've killed him. Come on. You two go on out. Come on. Mr. Wooster! Mr. Wooster! Bertie! Bertie! - Bertie.! Bertie, where are you? - Jeeves. Most extraordinary. He was here a moment ago. Oh, there you are. Here he is, miss. Bertie! Bertie, are you hurt? Marjorie, I was just having the most beautiful dream about you. Oh, this is my cousin, Mr. McDermott, the inventor. - How do you do? Jeeves, shake hands for me. - Yes, sir. Manville was going to try and get the plans of his invention. He was going to sell them to a foreign government. Yes. Where are the plans? Oh, here they are, sir. Will you ever forgive me, sir? - What for, Jeeves? - For hitting you on the head, sir. Oh, it's all right now, Jeeves. Everything's all right. Well, dash it! Everything's not all right. Jeeves, you ingrate. Get me out of the rough, will you? I'm afraid you'll need a blacksmith for that, sir. We owe a great deal to you, Mr. Wooster, and to your man. - Not at all. It was great fun. - Well, thanks anyway. I'll go and see if I can find that blacksmith for you. - How can I ever thank you for all you've done? - It isn't thanks I want. It's eternal devotion and everlasting friendship. Do you mean that, or are you still in a daze? I'm in a daze, but a wonderful daze. Parsons, orange blossoms, little choirboys? can you face that? Yes, if you promise me you'll never speak to a strange woman again. What are you doing? - Sittin' down. - Amazing. Oh, Jeeves, this is a very pleasant spot. We must spend our honeymoon here. Not our honeymoon, sir. Only yours. Jeeves, you don't mean you're leaving me still. How are we gonna manage? The young lady may have some idea, sir. I hear they generally have. That's right. I hadn't thought of that. - Shall I have a go at it till the blacksmith arrives? - Yes, please. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you, Jeeves.
