* WILD HERITAGE * Dirl! Hugh! Come here. The cart is uneven. You need more weight back. Put it on, your mother's dresser. Okay dad. Oh, dear!... The rear wheel is wobbly, Dad. The dresser can make a difference. It already did. Guys, it's time to go. Bye, pastor. I want to thank you for coming to say goodbye. Jake, Lucas says that the neighbor is the one who does us good, that is pious and that relieves our affliction, You did all that and more. That the brave spirit, who brought, your ancestors, here guide you to the west making your home. Emma. Goodbye pastor. Messourri. Talbot. Hugh. Bye. Dirk. Bye Jake, goodbye and God bless you all. Thank you, pastor. Yes sir. Thank you all. Hey Jake, have you ever argued, with an Indian? Ah!... John, couple. What are you going to do with the new land, without harvest? I'll plow!... When you, take courage and follow us, I will have the biggest farm in Topknot, with enough space to take a deep breath. Emma, be sure to write. How is she going to send the letter so far? Jake, stay on the trail, so you don't get lost. With everyone together, how are we going to get lost? Maybe I will see you there, one day, Missouri. Good trip. Our prayers are with you. Thank you all. Thank you. Boys, come up. We will. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Good luck. Take care. Bye. Bye. Watch out. Bye. Bye. Oh, Wow!... Hm!... Whip them, Talbot. Whip them. We will. Come on. Come on. We will. All together. Push. Continue, Talbot. Come on!... Oh!... Keep pushing. We're almost done. Ah!... Come, Missouri. We're doing it. Ah!... What a pity, dear... That's why, they give the land, that we want here. Dad, she wasn't serious. Yea! She will feel better, if the sun accompanies us. But we will need more than that to get there. It's the best blurry one, from your mother, that worries me. Mom, there's only 160Km left and we'll get there. Lets go. When johnny comes home, home. We will give you a warm, warm welcome. The men will sing, the boys will scream. The girls will show up. And we'll all be happy when. Johnny come home. When Johnny, come home, home. We will give you a warm, warm welcome. The men will sing, the boys will scream. The girls will show up. And we'll all be happy when. Johnny come home "SALOON" Whoa!... It is a very violent and rough land. It is a difficult country, eh, you have to be strong to face it. Face the country and not each other. They should be locked up, until they calm down. We are not at home. It will take time for the law to calm this region. Talbot, give me the gun. The stock is bad! Yea. But the bullet does not come from it. But you have to hold it, to shoot. Dirk, take the cart to the stream. I go to the salon, ask some questions. You, just ask for information, Jake Breslin. You know that here, business is done in the salon. I will not take too long. Come on. Go out Hey Talbot, take care of the horses. Let's go for a walk. Where do you think you're going? I will, don't worry. We went back with Dad. Well... You can go along, Talbot. Come on. Go out. Why did they leave the region? Good question, judge. I only know what I heard. It's just rumors. One thing is for sure, I will not ask. Ah, I'm sorry partner. I don't like to be pushed, farmer. I already apologized, men. It is not enough. Oh!... "BATHS" You didn't need to do that. He wasn't looking for a fight. Who are you? My name is Copeland. He's a lawyer from the East. He's a judge. You are not a judge here. Copeland. When an armed home man gets into a fight, he is asking. Dad! Dad! Go get mom. You better leave, or I will not be responsible. Arn, listen to the inexperienced lawyer. Won't you be responsible for what? Hold these farmers? Fort Laramie is not far from here. The soldiers don't want to know about Jud and me. They are facing the Indians. This is a land, for men. If the man is carrying a gun, it is good to be ready to use it. Make way. And your father? Jake Their name is Breslin. Their wagon, is in the stream near mine. Are you going to Topkont? They are. You take care of him. I will take care of the family. Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Oh! "JACOBE BRESLIN, REST IN PEACE" Ah, Father in heaven support me, night falls quickly and leaves, and the shores get deeper, Our Lord, support me, when other helpers fail and the consolation disappears, help from the helpless, trim me forever. I've done this a thousand times. Daddy, talkative of putting, a wooden handle on it He spoke yesterday. Dirk, we must not forget the past, but it?s like the future, that we should be concerned about. I understand that, mom When do you think, should we go back? I do not think. I think, that we should continue. Do you know what that means? I think so. Daddy would like us to continue. And what do you want? He's scared, you can see it. He's just showing off. He's not, afraid. You wait... Hugh! I think, that we should, talk about it. Dad had reasons to come here. They haven't changed. I think, everything has changed Of course, mother. But we needed a bigger farm before and we need one now. There is no room for us there. Not even for Hugh and me, if we have families. We would have to separate and come here. You talk like that, but you're not the boss. I want to go home to where my friends are. Who is scared now "Messouri"? Dirk, you're right. Let's go on, as if Daddy was here. But daddy is not here. We don't know where we're going, Nor what will we do when we get there. At home, it's easy. Mom Without your father, this is very risky. It is a risk that we do not have to take. Judge Copeland is coming. Hello, Judge Copeland. Hello people Hugh, take care of his horse. It looks like I'm interrupting a meeting. It seems that we are being interrupted. He thinks, that we should follow. Do you think not? I think it would be... Enough, Messouri. Sit down, judge. What do you think? Dirk and Hugh, want to move on. And the others don't want to. I think it would be very difficult, especially now. You are absolutely right. With young people, like these. Yes it's easier and a girl, is a small child. I think it is better to go back to the farm. And the Topknot region is not good for farms. What's the problem? There are many people in a very small area. The area on this side of Topknot. Carriage Hill, it's great for cattle But we don't know anything about cattle. And even though we know, we don't have money to buy. They cannot stay in the village, is too expensive. They knew that yesterday I saw a man pay, 1 dollar for a bag of potatoes of this height? If your children were older... And your girl. Wait a few more years on the farm. Then they will be prepared, to come here. And then.. They would be prepared, to live at any time Even now. We are young, judge. But these hills also. This is where we should stay. How about you, Talbot? Do you want to go home? Because? I've been there. Good... it seems that I lost the votes. Lost? We need 6-shot guns. This one... 6 shots? Because? We have to find two men. It won't bring Daddy back. Keep this. There are night camps along the trail. Upon arriving at the Car-Breaker, there will be 1 day left to arrive in Topknot. Until then, sir. Breslin. We'll be fine, Judge Copeland. I don't know how to thank you. Good luck. Good luck on the trail, guys. I'll see you in Tropknot. Whoa!... Talbet, take the bucket and fetch water. Missouri, pass me the bedding. Yes mom. You better get away, you can get hurt. Stopped! Who will hurt, who? I was talking about horses. I said they were country hens, that they don't know anything. I know something. Yes? Yes. How to make a farmer, eat land! Oh!... Ah!... Hugh!... Ah!... Hm!... I'm so sorry. Hey Jesse, get out of there! Come on, get up Hey, stop it. Are fighting! Bolivar, these young people have only fought since we started !. I'll teach you a lesson, Jesse! It wasn't his fault, Father Hugh Hugh, enough! You too, Dirk. Next time we?ll go to the end, seru half-bowl boots! Calilie! You are not a girl! Ah!... They hit everyone, don't they? I said there Bolivar, that Cadillie and Jesse need of Indians to scare them. It is a very violent land I found that out. I say so! You are Emma Breslin, aren't you? Yes. I heard about your problem. My condolences. Thanks. I'm Janet Bascomb and this is my husband Bolivar. Hello lady. Excuse me for all this, Mrs. Breslin. Especially afterwards, the problems he had. It's okay, sir. Bascomb. why don't you come over to the cart for tea with us? Behave yourself! Jesse!... Behave and don't get in trouble Your mother said, to behave. Ah, ah, ah... We ostracize them. I should have hit Callie! I would have fought, if I were you. It's too young to say that. I'm old enough to fight. I don't see any wagon. There will be no land left when we get to Toplnot. IF we go faster, the rear wheel will not hold. You saw, how the fight started. I saw how it ended. It hasn't fit yet. I'll take care of these Breslin! Including me? You wouldn't want me to fight with the whole family, would you? Anyway, we're not the last. We're still ahead of that pack. If Jesse doesn't stay away from missouri, you'll be beaten again! Where should he walk? With us? You're a donkey, with a chicken head, pull it out! Come on! It's no use, Callie. Well they are not going anywhere. I think we will have to stay, mrs. Breslin. Oh, we like your company. Horses need to rest. Let's go here with them. One of the wheels is wobbly. Oh, don't do that. They contained alone. There is still a lot of ground to reach Topknot. I heard in a village that there was a way around the hills. That was 25 km to the north. Let's try this way. They say it?s easier, but it?s longer, Dad. We will peel and then continue on the easy path. See you in Topknot. If we're lucky. We will miss you all, Janet. Don't worry, Emma. Let's get to them, even if I pull the cart myself There is a smooth climb ahead. After that everything is quiet. Mother and Missouri, take the horses You and I will pull. Talbotm you are light. So guide. It can't be the right track. You are a smart girl. So find a better "Missouri". Do not call me like that! I will slap harder. than that of Callie Bascomb! Wild, let's go to the top. Why don't we build the farm here? We need 20 horses to transport a plow here. Mainly, an old plow like ours. Okay Talbot, come on! Hyeah!... hyeah!... Come on! Come on boy. Come on boy! Comes! Fast! Come on. We will! We have to get to the top. Come on! Fast! Come on! Go. Come on, go! Come on! Fast! Hold on, Hugh. Hold on! Talbot, jump! Get out of the way! Talbot! Talbot. Oh, stop it. I didn't know that hitting someone was the cure for a fall. Who got hurt? Only the cart. It won't be better to go and see how she's doing Oh!... It's not bad, mom. You can fix it. Not only the broken dressers, you fool! We are not very good, climbing mountains, are we? That wheel is destroyed. Nils Jansen, is a blacksmith. I go to the village. He went to emboar with the others. Good!... So first we have to see what's left. Support can solve it. A support? Yes. We can cut, remove the wheel and drag the cart. Ah!... Why not? Yes the grass is slippery, like snow. It is even more slippery. Where's the stream? Down under the trees. It is a good place to stay. My dress looks awful. You and your hills! Rse pants. Jesse, you won't mind. Pants? If you think I will... Stop. We are tired. No use, discounting the other. Oh Hugh, take the cart up to the trees, before taking out the horses. It's ok. Come on boys. Car-Breaker Hill. They gave you the right name. Hey, there's a cart coming. It's the Jansen! And that blue-eyed girl, Hilda. What will happen? Hello mrs. Breslin. Hello, hello. Oh you must be tired. Go down and have a coffee. Yes. We went back to the village, when we saw the smoke. Glad to see you. Hi, Sir. Jansen. All right? Hello. I understand, why they stopped. Yes they did a good job, but I do... that only a new wheel and axle will fix the cart. I didn't stay like that. I'll fix it. Oh thank you. What happened? Didn't Topknot work? No, it is very populated. Only the rocks remain. The judge was right. Well, my tools are in the cart, Hugh. Hilda is not one of them. Hilda, let him go get my tools. Bye. Bye. We hope to see you soon. Bye, Hilda. Thank you very much. Bye. Bye. Hilda is very beautiful. She didn't say memsod and you, Mr. Hugh Adam Davis Breslin. Dirk... I was thinking, what did Mr. Jansen said, about Topknot being too crowded. I've been thinking about it too. We have no cattle, we cannot plow this land, but we can make a big garden Do you remember what the judge said about prices in the village? We could grow food, to sell. So we could support ourselves and buy cattle. Did I say something funny? Do not. You reminded me of something. Like the idea? I think, that's what should be done... sr, Breslin. That was the right decision, Mrs. Breslin. Oh, we haven't decided, Judge Copeland. We fell here! Like the Bascomb horses. Bascomb? Yes they stopped, north of here. And each breakdown leaves the family in the right place at the right time. Good. Since we started well, over time, perhaps they sleep, the entire southern half of these hills. Maybe the northern half too. Bascomb can counter it. I saw their house yesterday. There is space for two families in this hills. Yes and good neighbors, they are a blessing. Good land is also. You may not have money, to buy cattle now, but has the right to land, as a soldier's widow and you should register it soon. I could go with you now. Good. Ah!... Hugh, prepare the horses. Missouri, Talbot and me, we go with Judge Copeland. I will stay with Dirk. There is a lot of work to be done. Someone, you have to supervise. Come on Missouri. Hey, this looks like deer hair. It's a good idea. Deer hair and clay. Take any time. The Talbot you discovered. Talbot? He is the thinker of the family. Dirk... you have a wonderful mother. Take care of her. Help her to keep this land. I am in a village region. I want the Breslin to grow up with it. Don't worry mom. Let's take care of things. Bring them back until sunset in the morning. I hope my home is ready. Talbot, take care of your brothers. Bye, boys. Bye mom. Bye mom. Bye. Well, aren't we going to set up the house? We can get six-shot guns in the village. For a price, which we cannot pay Let's meet those two. They went to emboar. Dirk, it's Jesse! That thief! Hey! Hey, I didn't come here to fight. Talbot, why did you do that? It wasn `t fair. You wanted to hurt him, didn't you? I wanted. I would have defeated him, but... He's defeated. Do you want water? I don't want anything from you. What happened? A fight. A fight? A horse fell on Dad and wounded him. I said, for Jesse to come for medicine, while I went after you. We think... we came for help and that's what we got. Come on, Jesse. Jesse, I didn't know... Not now. I'm going to get mom. If we pick it up, we will arrive at the Bascomb tomorrow afternoon. Mom! "BOLIVAR BASCOMB" Rest in peace Come on, Dirk. Come on. Janet... I came like this, that I found out. I was in the village. Dirk went to get me. I had no way of helping him. He was badly hurt. It only lasted a few hours. It's hard to think, to be without it. I would appreciate it very much if I stayed a while. Calie and I are tired of looking at each other. All right. I'm going to make some tea. You have a beautiful horse, Jesse. We will choose a good place. The water is better than ours. Our mother registered us, our land yesterday. My condolences, for your father. Am sorry... You are pitiful. We made a mistake. We!... He's commenting on another one now. It's in our land. Hidden behind your mother's skirt. I told your brother and I repeat, we regret everything, what happened. We regret, much more, than you think. There's no need to fight now I also had no reason to hit Jesse. But it hit me like that. Listen, I... Save your breath. You will need it when you leave without your mother. Cattle! It seems to be a big herd, across the hill. And it's coming here. What are the cows doing here? I will find out. You better wait, Mom and Dirk. He does not need. Sai, Talbot. Mother, Dirk, I heard a cattle coming. I think someone, is on our land. I'm going to get daddy's weapons. Hugh, go see and do it. Come on, hya. There is the camp. Come on. Rusty, we have visitors. Hello. Hello, guys. Are you planning on staying here? Just a few days. Is the land yours? Yea. we won't be long. Come on, eat. There are beans for everyone. Here's a boy. If the plate is empty, it is because it is ready to be filled. Rinse and clean the sleeve It has more patches than the mango, Chaco. We guessed right, Jud. It's a big cattle. Yea. And she's grown up. It is better than creating them. Let's take a look. Boys, meet my pedestrians. These are Brazos, Johnny. Hull and Chaco. I'm Rosty. How are you? Chaco cooks, so fight him. I'm Dirk Breslin. This is my brother Hugh. Hello. Hi. Hello. Guys, isn't there flat land here? I'm already sick. The house is on a level ground. I go there, just to sleep straight. Every night, it's the same thing. I sleep with my feet on a hill, my back on the other and my ass in a ditch. I'm staying, in the shape of a horseshoe. Brazos, if we find, the things that they spoke to us, you will want five ditches, where you can hide. Did you hear about cattle thieves around here? Do not. Well if you try something, you will have a warm welcome. How much does it cost, one of these? Your life, when you need to use it. I meant is money. Why do you need a 6-shot gun? Two men, need to be killed. A 6-shot gun, like this, worth about seven oxen. On this trip, it can be worth the entire cattle. I don't have seven oxen, but I need a gun. Do your parents raise cattle? No. We are only the owners of this land. When we fill up with cattle, our ranch will be bigger. Have you ever seen a big crack? In a big area, like Texas? This will be big enough for us. IS? Come back another day. The same goes for all of you. Mama will be happy to welcome you. To eat? Yea. How about tomorrow? It's ok. So it's agreed. We will take the meat. We will even kill her. There are seven. Let's get together and separate and by them in the usual place. I've seen enough. Here we go. You need to know how to control the ox There's no way to mark it when you're running. How do you get the gun out quickly? This is the last thing you need to learn. Need to know the gun and yourself, before trying tricks. The Apaches made me run in a canyon I walk and without a bullet. I remember it again, in Panhandle. What happened? I'm getting to that part. The Texas panhandle... Not when the aapaches surrounded him in the canyon. Oh, them! I'll come back to that later. That time in the south... Bless us, Mr, and His gifts. Amen!... That we will receive from your generosity, Amen. Amen!... Can you pass me the potatoes? Talk about Texas... Ah!... The worst thing about these trips, are the beans. One day they are cooked, the next day they are fried. But they always burn out. You will always be welcome, with or without meat. Me with charging isos back. We will leave in the morning. If you need help, I'm ready. You don't know, what you're talking about. For a 6-shot gun, I would face 50 thieves. I believe. I'm going to go back to camp and see how Johnny is doing. What time are you leaving? With the sunrises. And here he is born so early, when in Texas... Dirk, ask the boys to go as soon as possible. That's right, Rusty Dirk! Dirk, Hugh is missing. It's gone? I can't find it anywhere. Help me with this and we'll look for it. Yes. You saw him? Do not. I think, he went hunting. Hunting, my ass! Missouri. Since, the Texans came... It's better to look for him. I get worried when he hunts alone. Tlabot, seal the Spot. Missouri, help Talbot. Dirk, why did he do that? Mom, they are our friends. There may be a fight. A fight? A fight with guns! Hugh turns 18, next month. Talk to the Bascomb. I don't need Jesse's help. In this land, everyone needs help from the fools who came. No, Dirk. It was not foolish to come here. Bring it back. Could not be better. They are at the camp. Some are unarmed. Come on. Come on. Hyah... Hugh! Let them get closer. I lost my rifle. Now. Let's go. I don't usually pull out, a man's rifle. I said, that I would see them again Next time, they won't run away. Rusty, what happened to the cattle? Except with the exception of groups that came to the south. Brazos, next time... Wait, Rusty. Guys, there's another weapon in the bag. Take it, Dirk. These weapons are as good as those that cost 7 oxen. They will teach them, how to use it. It was all my fault. I didn't think they would tie during the day. At least they didn't, the whole herd. The shovel is in the cart. There are about 100 heads, going back to water and pasture. I want to teach you how to shoot. I better teach you how to serve before you get hurt Come down. You too, Dirk. There is water there. It's time to stop. Let your arms fall naturally. So it?s not good. Let's fix it. Let your arms fall. That's better. You can't do it, with the gun so low, but you can draw. Try it. Try again. This time hit the branch. It is bad. It's really bad. Does it take too long to be that fast? You drew faster than me, but I got it right. There is no point in serving quickly, without hitting the target. And the difficult targets are the ones that move and shoot back. Weak animals. Trail things. When I bring a cattle, Ino next summer, I bring a reproduce. Are you going to leave the cattle here? I think, will I take you, to Texas? And the owner? I was the owner. Now it's yours. I crossed the Big Red, with 1,033 heads. The further north we went, the less was left. Let it be a lesson to both, you have to fight for what you want. And then to fight, even more to maintain. But you fought, for these cattle. We can't take it without paying anything You saved my life. You have guns and cattle. Learn to deal with both. Good luck. You can stay with us, Rusty. Thank you, but it is not my land. Hey, mom! Mom! Talbot! Where is everyone? Missouri! Mom! Please give me water. Where is everyone? Give me water. Dirk! Please. Hugh! Mom is... Ah!... See what's up with them. Ah!... Beverage. Dirk, what's up with them? Ah!... She is naked. Hm!... Go after Mrs. Bascomb! Fast! Ah!... A drink... Deite-se. I'm not sick, Dirk. What happened? After you left, Missouri was like that. Then Mom. And you didn't get it? I did not have time. I'm just tired. Go to sleep. We can only wait. I need fresh water, for the night. You... say your prayers and sleep. Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Lord, even if our family doesn't recover, I promise to give half of the cattle to the Bascomb. Amen. We are very grateful. People with problems need help. I felt better, as soon as I saw your mother... is that you. Is... It's their cattle! Hello! Hi, Callie. Hi! Hi. Hi, Breslin. It's good to see them. Don't just stand there and take root. Dismount. Come on, talk a little. Go boil water for tea. We have visits. I will help you. Great. We brought metado, from our cattle Mrs. Bascomb. Or almost half. We couldn't get some. Half of your cattle? Because? The lady helped us. Mom and Missouri are fine now. There is no need to think, that you owe us something. We can survive without the cows. We really can. We don't need anything, from the Breslin. Oh Jesse, don't talk like that. We want you to keep the cattle. Mom wants it too. No. We can take you back. Livestock is just one reason. The other is this one. Mom and I did it for you. We wanted to thank you appropriately. I never had anything like this. You will look beautiful in yourself. It's very kind of you. I don't know how to use it, something so beautiful, without being at a wedding. Anyway, I really appreciate it. We don't need it and we don't want it. Callie will say the same thing. Jesse is kidding again. He needs a hand to guide him. Stop saying those things. They want to help us. It doesn't matter the intention. I don't want anything that is theirs. Ask Clie. We do not receive charity. We will not receive now. Missouri, you talked about the cattle. We will gladly stay with him. It's the fastest trigger on this side, from Missouri. It may not be the fastest, but it is more accurate. Now. We got it right three times. It's time to slaughter oxen, to change. Mom is running out of food. Of course, the bullets come first, then the food. come on gunslinger. "BATHS" Good! it was time for you to visit the city! How is your mother? Okay, thanks. No one else has been ill since the Talbot cleared the stream. Do you think Mr. Carmody, do you want oxen? Let's go and ask him. How much you want. Good... 8 dollars a head, okay, but you will have to accept half of the exchange. It looks pretty fair. Talbot, watch them. You need more meat, Ben. And what would I do with it. It would sell. Why would I keep you here? I can sell everything on credit. Very well, Ben. Everything here on credit. You will lose a lot, but you will build the city. We have three top cows out there. Good judge. Well, three prime meats. 12 dollars a head. Hang some posters here. If someone asks for credit, answer it. That's how I spoke in my city. If you go bankrupt, we'll all go bankrupt 10 dollars a head. Ah, you step on the men, judge 7 dollars. But it's cattle first, Well. All right. 9 dollars a head. 8 dollars, all in return. Half in return. We need bullets. Colt, .45 caliber. Ah, ah! ... Is good? Is good. IS. Look. Look. Yes, it's ready. Thank you, sir. Jansen. Thank you very much. Wait until I get the oxen. Branding is not as easy as you think... So we better train. Let's start with him. Hey!... Look, the farmers... And armed. They shouldn't be playing with real weapons. They will get hurt. Those oxen are ours. Where did they get them? Are ours. Their? Jud, what happens, with cattle thieves here? We hang them. Tall, dry and slow. See Arn's hair. Do you remember the three, who came to the south of the well? On second thought, you are right. Hugh, no! Try this again and you will have three eyes. Those cows are ours. Do you have a sales receipt? Rusty, the owner, gave it to us. He stole it from us boy. Forget the brand iron. Everything has. Let's get them back. Where are? In our land, which is their place. Jud, we can't tolerate thieves, can we? No way. No thieves and gunshots. I'm glad we didn't decide to be gunmen. Nobody is hurt. Will this tera be worth dying for? I dont know. Texans paid a high price for those oxen. Do we want to live here or not? With all this violence! Mother, if we want to have something here, we have to fight to get and then still struggle to maintain. Hyah, hyah. Do not. Hyah!... No!... Are you alright? I am. Rusty, it made it look so easy... Dirk is coming. Don't you get to tie them? Do not. There must be an easier way. Easy or not, we have to feed the cattle. We can tie them with the mare donated by Jesse. She's fast. It is better to work with Bascomb. We must warn you about Arn and Jud. Now is the best time. We were going to say that we had problems in the village. That's what we heard. That's why we came. Mom thinks, that our only chance against thieves, is to gather the cattle, mark them and take care of them. This can work. Hugh and I helped bring your cattle here. What do you think? Jesse and I were unable to bring it alone. Missouri, get on with that iron! Can't we wait a year? I'm going! You women frankly... There must be an easier way. There is an easier way! Dirk, do you know the beams that were too small for the house? What do you want with them? Comes. I'll show you. Bring the first one. Come on, come on. Come on. IS. Come on, come on. Tlabot, you can score. Well, we still have to get them. Hello. Hello. Your deed, Mrs. Breslin. Now it's all legally yours. Thank you, Judge Copeland. You didn't have to come here, just to deliver this. Well, actually, that was just an excuse to see her. See you all. Where are the boys? They are taking care of the cattle, with the Bascomb. It was time to make amends. Ah yes, we are very happy. Speaking of feelings, Mrs. Breslin, there is a particular subject that I would like to discuss. You can always speak your mind in my presence, Judge Copeland. I'm hesitating, because it may be too soon. It may be too soon... for them. Ah!... Hello. Because of their appearance, the cows won. Where's Missouri? Wait until you see it. She stopped at the stream to clean herself up. It is what you should have done. Oh!... With license, judge. I want to see if he is mine. I will be back soon. Dirk... I gave your mother the deed from your father and you can also register land. Thus, you will own all the southern part of the hills. Jesse will want to do that too. He should. Their land is already small for cattle. Is the cattle marked? It is. Callie and Jesse will be on watch tonight. If you need help, let me know. Remember that. Hyah, hyah!... Hyah!... Go back to the camp. I'll do the round alone. All right. There is one of them. Yea! We will arrest him, then we will attack the cattle. This shot must bring, who is doing the round Then we took the cattle and ran away. Children! The cart does not need a new wheel. If you want to go see Hilda, why don't you go see her? Look who is talking! Why did you only start helping when Jesse came to work. If not, the passionate Breslin... Where's Callie in love? It is the first time that he is away from her this week. Now that's enough. Cupid already has many problems. I know who, Mom likes. Of me! Tabot!... There is a horse, moving. Turn off the other light. Dirk, be careful. Mom don't worry. Cover me with the window. What happened? Arn and jud shot her, before I could, do something. You better call your mom. Where do you think, that they took the cattle The other time, they took it to the village. That's where we'll see it first. Dirkm Callie wants to see you. She saw to be well. Stay just a little bit, Dirk. How it feels? Is sick? Stomping my feet hurts more, which is just tired. Watching the cattle is a man's job. Getting it back is also. Dirk... Jesse and his brothers will hear you. Don't go after those killers. Nothing here is worth another murder. That bull belongs to us. Look for the cattle and not a fight, with weapons. Cirk, please. We are not going after a fight, Callie. We'll be back soon, wake up. Where's Mom? She went to get water. Come on. Tell mom, we went to the village after the cattle. Be careful. Where did they go? They went after the cattle. And the killers. Those who killed her husband, attacked the Texans and shot Callie. Where are they going? For the village. I have to stop them. They're boys! They're men! They have been men since their father died. You can't change that And you can't stop them from fighting for their land. What does the land mean to us? I don't want the land, I want my children. You go with her. Take my horse. I knew they would come. The cattle is grazing on the other side of the hill. Did they bring you Arn and Jud in the morning? They are with her. And we will stay with her. You don't learn, boy. We don't warn, what happens, with the thieves? As the judge said, the cattle are on the other side of the hill. We will take you, to the north. After we drink something. Talbote, take the horses, to the other side of the houses. And stay there. I don't want anyone shooting at you. Hugh and Jesse, go over there. I will stay on this side of the street. Oh and remember: the important thing is not to withdraw quickly... is to aim well. Listen to boys. You do not... We'll take care of that. Alone. It doesn't matter, what happens. Dirk, listen to me. They shot Callie, judge. Jansen and I will help you. No. The fight is ours. Judge. You said to ask for help if we needed it. Okay, I'm asking. There is one thing you can do. If it gets bad, for our side, I would like to know, who will take care of the family. Don't dirk. Can not... "BATHS" "HALL" "BATHS" "BATHS" "BATHS" Shall we say something when they leave? They will know. "HALL" "HALL" "HALL" "HALL" "BATHS" I think we have a few. They want to fight. Do nothing until I give the signal. "BATHS" "HALL" "BATHS" "BATHS" Now! Stop right there! "HALL" "BATHS" "HALL" It is very bad? I still move my fingers. It's not too bad. Thank. I fixed the stock. Yes, I realised. "BATHS" "BATHS" Callie! Come on. Watch out. When Hugh and Jensen catch the cattle, the Breslin ranch will be complete again. It is a young land, but it is rich. And now it's yours. It seems to be a lot of land, for one family. I think, we're going to need it. "THE END"
