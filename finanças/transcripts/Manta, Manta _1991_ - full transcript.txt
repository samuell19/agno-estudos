M A N T A M A N T A Hello, this is Radio 88, your good mood station. And now back to our friends who have a roll bar for brains. Could you please change the station. But he plays the best music! Two Manta drivers meet, says one ?I bought myself a book? Says the other ?and, did it fit in you car??. Did you get that? Well then, let's race! Oh no, Manta drivers Move over you piece of shit! Stupid bastard He is doing that on purpose! Dumb animal! I don?t belive this! You?re finished! Nice car, but the nerves.. the nerves... You were just lucky.. otherwise I would have won the race. Hey you, do you have shit for brains? Can?t you practice somewhere else? And stop grinning, Bertie. Watch it! - No you watch it... And.. are you proud of your junk yard? Calm down Nicky Lauda, what?s your problem? He just wanted to compete too in the race! But you just forgot to sign up... He doesn?t want to risk it anyways in his yuppie wagon. What? Me driving in your race, that?s funny. That would be something, or are you scared? Boy, you are way out of my league. Big mouth, a Mercedes star is not good enough to win! You?re telling me that driving abilities are required too? Well, are we racing or not? Why should we, what?s in it for me? Then we know who is the better driver. I already know who is best! Well then, if you already know, come to the chemical plant tomorrow and we wil find out. What do I get when i win? Kid, you have nothing, forget it Bertie. Here Axel, 5000. OK, Bertie, now we you are talking! See you tomorrow then. Are you crazy? What about the downpayment on our house? Oh, don?t you worry about that, I will take care of that. But you will have to put in a lot of effort. This is madness! Why are you so negative? Asshole! Ushi, don?t give up so fast. That slick bastard doesn?t stand a change against me. I am the best in town, and you know it! What when we don?t get the house because of this? Hold on, you saw how I blew away that GTI.. You know how long we haved saved for those 5.000. yes, but if i win, we have 10.000. And we do need decoration for the house. Hey Angie, how?s it going? - Super By yourself today? -Yep. Hi Angie... oh, sorry How did you end up here? Good that we meet! One portion chips please! Tomorrow is my birthday. Well then, best wishes! You forget your chips... wait up... I was thinking about throwing a party... if it weren?t for my folks. . But tomorrow I am buying drinks. I mean, if you want to join... 200 is not good enough, I need a 345 ... I am racing today! With the camshaft? 9.30!!! I am late again. Why did you not wake me? The cog wheels are 284 degrees sharpened? Stop the Latin blabbering. Speak German. I would have to ask Gerd that. Gertie, breakfast is ready Are you calling? Who is that? Mam, you are bugging me! No, no, not you.. I was talking to my mum. Ok, make sure it works. Ciao. Man o man, I will never win like this. You are not serious about racing, are you? Shhhh, my mum... She can know we do more than holding hands. She is such a strict Catholic even stricter than the Pope. I can?t take it much longer we should have a place for ourselves. Baby, not again! When i get my new tires, there is no problem at all. And when not? Speed up a bit. You look good. Bertie, I am getting tired of this game. Could you not reconsider the race? But why? He doesn?t stand a chance against me. He has a Merc. You think I?m scared? I have a reputation to think about Yes, as an idiot. Look at that... Shit. Any day now. First to the car wash. are you nuts? I am already an hour too late. You think I drive into town like this? So that people can have a laugh? What is more important to you? Me or your stupid car? The manta doesn?t talk back like you! Ushi, come back now! Stupid cow. Asshole. How much? Excuse me? How much? Is 100 ok? Blow me! Is that included? Just kidding. Are you going into town? Sure, get in. Did you really think I am a hooker? Beautiful girls like you don?t stand in the streets. You seem to know your business. I get around. Wow, this car is fast. For 300.000 you can expect something. 300 000? You can get a house for that. True, but they are not as fast. Now I understand why you charge 10 Mark for a coke in your pub. You have to look at that from another perspective Think about the costs of decoration The lights and the lasershow salary of staff etc. etc.. By the way, we hold a beauty contest this evening You want to partipate? Bertie... Did dan elephant piss on your roof or something? Man that smells bad. But a beauty, I have a Porsche too. Whoa, that was fast. What?s this then? A school? thanks for the drive. See you at the Westside pub this evening. I?m buying. Cool! Hey Klausy, do you have to go far? 15 minutes. Do you want to take the car? What? It?s your birthday. Man, Klausy. Make sure the car is at the pub at 12, ok? And no scratches. You know me, Gertie. Hairstudio Edith, you do a quick perm? If you want to freshen up your high lights... Maybe another time. All right, We'll see eachother at the Miss contest? I have not said 'yes' yet. Wasn't that the guy from Westside? Yes, why? Don't knaw at your finger nails. Oh, no. the urine test. completely forgot. That's so typical How am I oing to do the pregnancy test? Come on, let's go inside. Was about time that you came! coming. Do you like the haircut? Would it work with this? You just have to aim properly. How do you know the Westside guy? He invited me to a Miss contest. You are not going to do that, are you? Of course not Although, a week Ibiza... With Manta dude.. How is he going to get his Manta in the plane? Hey guys, how's it hanging?? Hi Klausy,hey ... brandnew Manta booties. Super hip. respect! Not bad, huh? bad? There so hot, you should build glass doors in your Manta. So that people can see it while you ride. That's not possible, it's not my car. The boots are still ... a bit, huh? yeah, a bit. Before you put the boots on for the first time You have to pee in them. Are you joking, or what? Klausy, honest! It's the oldest trick in the book. It's what our soldiers in Stalingrad used to do. True? Sure. Just... And they will fit like a glove. Say Klausy, are you o.k.? Yes. What is that for? That's obvious, isn't it? Peeing in your boots. I don't get it. Well, the soldiers in Russia did it too. But Klausy, they lost the war... So, and the last one is Gerd Honawitz. Congratulations mister Honawitz. Your friends and colleagues, will be amazed that one of you made it, huh? Yes, I think so too. Hello my friends, this is Radio 88. Why are Manta drivers allowed to smoke in 4th grade? Because they are already 18 by then. Say Klausy, why are you tanking lead free gasoline? Because of the environment. so that the trees don't die. But with lead your car would have better ..wegligging. Lead is heavy, it would lower your car by approximately 10 centimeters. But good that you are going eco. Hey Klausy. Hi. Hey Turk. You're transporting pickles again? Yep, your girl friend ordered one, so that she has something worthwhile in her hands again. Hey, before she would her hands on your produce she'd rather go to a quality superarket. And, troubles? Hey Bertie, why not leave that 5000 here, than you can spare yourself the embarresment. I was just about to make you the same offer. ?? ??-?????,???. Klausy, all the best wishes for your birthday. Congratulations Klausy. Thanks. And, what are you up to this honorouble day? Hunting for game. No compromises. I'll count to three, and if they are not gone then they are mine. He's never going to hook up like this. We will have to help him out. Man, I have no time for that. I will take care of that. (Radio) Have you heard the newest Manta joke?... ... A Manta is parked in front of the university ... Thank you. So Klausy, happy birthday again. Thanks, Hakan. Pump 7. 64 Mark. And a chewing gum...lighter...and a fox tail ...and...and... What about a ice scratcher for the car windows? That's it. 69,50. Can you pick me up after work, to go swimming?

Would it be enough? Ah, you really did your best. He thinks he is all that. Who, Hakan? He is all right. And he looks good too. Mr. Popular. Come on, you fancy him. Would he notice? For him I'm probably just air. Take the initiative. That's so not me. Stop rationalizing, Make a first move. Ushi, could you wash the young man's hair. Let's go, that's your chance. Are you crazy? The first contact is very important. How come you are here, I thought you only work on appointment. Yes.. No, I'm here for omscholing/bijscholing. Head down. Ai, that's hot Take it easy. Somewhere between boiling hot, and ice cold is good. Great, you preheated the shampoo. But why is it so fluid? It's a pure natural product. Completely biological. I can tell. Shouldn't you massage it in? No, I don't think so. It just has to soak a bit. Just has to soak. I don't sell luxurious cars for 10.000, not for 8.000, not for 6.000. But for a ridiculous 4.000! This beautiful Kadet LS build in 1974. Hi Eckardt. You're looking sharp today. Is Gertie in? May I use your phone? In the office. The commercial will be aired on monday Right?

That is not going to be easy. The spoilers are ok... Where have you been all morning? It took a bit longer. Good grip, but a little big. For a couple of additional inches. How important is penis size? Question mark! Gert, I am not into your jokes. Let's check the Manta. And get out of the car before the owner returns. We first have to settle, whether penis size really matters It can't be all about length? But instead?... Yes, because? Nice car. I'm Gert. Good for you. I am Bertie. Hey, and you? Who was that?

Gerd, I think I have to let things run through my head. What does he mean by that? He has to puke. What's the use of that bucket? I don't know, maybe it's for when someone get's sick. And now the highlight of the show... Could the volunteers please come on stage. Grab the buckets. On my command... Attention 3...2.... Could Klaus get Angie a cola? Sure, a thousand. Respect, it really is your day today. You got that right. I see Klausy gets the full progam. But you can stop the baby sitting, it's past midnight already. Come on, stop the nonsense. Babysitting? midnight? How do you mean? It was your birthday. What has that got to do with my birthday? Nothing! Hold on. You have been leading me on all day, or not? No Klausy, you're getting it all wrong. I'm such an idiot! That's allright. Klausy,hold on. So you live here?. Still here? And you're not even blond. Bertie, let's go see Ushie. I thought you were bailing out. Never...I will drive.. and I will win. Ok, then I'll see you in 10 minutes. Are you crazy? What? He wants to race like that? Bertie, that's dangerous. Don't do it...

In 5 months we meet again, to support Ushie in the finals. Not really... I don't look that bad. Right...but I don't know if pregnant women can participate. What? You told me it was positive. I screwed up. Now it's positive. So it's negative. Ok, thanks very much. Bertie is totally wasted. He wants to race. Oh no, where is he? To the chemical plant. I'm coming with you. I can't find my car. where's Klausy? I left something in the car. Can I have the keys? The Ferrari? Yes. Don't lose them, ok? Where did she go? Who? Ushie. Don't know.

Don't talk so much. I want to tell you something... You can save you silly comments. When I was in the jury, you would have won. Really? Really. Hey...here it is... Now this is a car! right? What's that? This is too much. Is not mine, I swear. Oh, it's you. did you see Klausy? No, but we'll find him. Come get in. You idiot. So, Bertie? You drank a lot, right? I say we go. Well then.... Bertie. Oh no, not her. Don't do it. Get lost, you're disturbing. Go back to your guy. You can't drive in this state. Are you tired of life? What do you care? Stop it, I need you. Now you need me... We need you Who is we? I'm pregnant. By me?... Who else?! Boy or girl? Are you all nuts? What is this? I'm going to be a dad! What? really? You should enroll him in special school. Where's Klausy? Now who's racing? I don't care who loses his car. Hey Klausy! Let's do this. Or are you scared? At last! Stop it, you can't handle this car. Let him, he will do fine. Klausy, be smart. Are you staying here or what? Shut it! It is a race, not a tea party. Stay out of it. Come on, wave your flag. Let's go! Total idiot. -he is killing the engine! Shall I give you a push?. Are you crazy? Did you loose your mind? Bertie, stop it! Ok, you're not getting in my disco. You too! All of you, for ever! Sure. You got that? Oh shit! You're bleeding! Don't let it get on my suit. Where's my Benz? It's totally ruined. Such a nice Benz. Ruined! Stop crying. A bit of polish and she's all new. I have a Manta for sale by the way... You were great! You were scared for me, yes? No. Really? I don't need a baby sitter. But who is going to look after you? What's this then? WillI need it, when you introduce me to your parents? You promised... what?... your phone number.
