Hey streamers, how's it going? It's Ethan here. I am finally doing it. I'm moving to Los Angeles, I am on my way. I am about to catch a bus and I packed all my things. I'm leaving. I'm gonna become a famous actor. I just know it, I can feel it for myself, you know. I'm gonna be a hundred percent honest with you guys. My mom kind of gave me like the ultimatum of ultimatums where she told me that if I don't stop being gay, then I can't live there anymore. So as you know, you can't stop being something that you are. So I'm off. Everyone, I made it iconic Hollywood and Vine sign. I can't believe I made it this far. All right, I'll check you later. Hey, is this apartment one? No, it's actually over there. Oh. Oh my gosh, you must be Al's new roommate. Ah, yeah. I'm your neighbor, I live right back there. I'm just out here taking my medicine. Cool, cool. Do you want the last hit before you knock on the door? Sure, why not? Oh my God, are you okay? Yeah, it's much stronger than the stuff I have at home. My name's Ethan, by the way. What's your name? My name is Ricardo Manuel Diego de la Mon, but most people just call me Ricky. Well, thanks for the weed, but I should probably... Hey, before you knock on the door. Did you say something? Yeah. I just wanted to give you a heads up. Al seems like a really nice guy, but he's been going through a lot of roommates lately. I don't know what that's about. I just wanted to let you know. Okay. Thank you, nice to meet you. I'm a hugger, new roomy. Let me show you your room. Great. It's right back this way. I left it pretty empty so you can do whatever you want with it. Great. Well, I'll leave you to it. I know you must be exhausted. Perfect, I really don't need much. Thank you. Sure. See you later. Welcome to sunny Southern California. Okay, my new behind the wheel dilettante named Imani. Your pronouns are she/her. My name is Raymond, my pronouns are he/him. I'm the head of the LGBT transportation department. I maintain order through safety while this department is under my magnificent and watchful eye. Okay, got a busy day so let's get started. Okay. T-minus 300 seconds to debrief you on your orientation. And then we will begin the first of your many transportation training days. Glad you're with us. It's raining cats and dogs out here. Let's get started. Ethan, I'm not really sure where you are, but with the Lord's help, you can receive his forgiveness and love. Fuck you. Thank you for calling Greyhound. You can say check schedules, book a trip, find a bus stop, track my bus, or say help me with something else. Pancakes, bacon, hash browns. Sound good? Yeah. You know, I forgot if you were keto or vegan or something like that, but anyway, sit down and pour yourself some OJ. You okay? Fine, yeah. Yeah. What's all this? I've been saving for this move, working fast food, smelling like old grease, you know, just trying to get out of my family's religious claws. I just lost all the money that I saved. It was stolen or something on the bus and you know, I called Greyhound, but it's not like anybody is gonna turn in $4,000 in cash, you know? Oh, wow. I'm so sorry. There's plenty of fast food places here. Hey, you're paid up until the end of the month. I'm sure you'll be able to find a job. I'm living on kind of a tight budget, so if you don't... Yeah, I understand. I do, yeah. These pancakes look amazing. Thanks. You know, I've got some contacts in the industry, casting directors, agents, producers to mention a few. What if I reached out to some of them for you? Maybe I can have one 'em over for a drink or something. Maybe one of them can help you. I mean, that would be outrageous. That's great, I'll reach out. Man, I'm gonna have to find a job or something real quick now. Good morning, streamers. Ethan here. Already, my new roomie is gonna set me up with some nice connections in Hollywood. So be ready to see me on screen real quick. I can't believe it. It's been raining for days now. Who says it never rains in LA? I want introduce you to this beautiful work of art. The van! The LGBT Center's newest asset. Or new to the LGBT Center. She's top of the line, the transportation that takes us to our higher power. Smell that Imani? It's the smell of hope and freedom. Soon you will be assigned a transportation department vehicle of your own and complete a noble and inspiring deed every time you do. In the end, you'll know everything there is to know about transporting homeless youth to the center and all the information you'll need to navigate the treacherous and unforgiving waters of the streets of LA. You think you can handle it? I think I... Good, I'm glad to hear your sweet reply of approval. Mm. Okay. On to our first pickup of the day. All right streamers, check it out. Look, we are at the world renowned Chinese Theater. Look at it. So many parties, award ceremonies and movie premieres all happen right here. Yeah. Yeah. I'll hold, I'll hold. Hey, how you doing? Yeah, yeah. I was calling about my schedule next week. I was hoping if there was any chance I could get any more hours? Uh, I think at this moment, this is all we could do for you. I'll work anytime. I'll come really early. I'll even learn how to make the bagels, like I'll even wipe the floors. I'll do anything, just let me know. I understand, I understand. Just at the moment... Yeah, yep, yep, yep. We have all the staff that we basically need for full-time. See, I'm only working 12 hours next week and I was really hoping for a full-time position. And you did promise that at least that... But right now we can't do that. Yeah, yep. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but we... Yeah, I understand. Thank you. See you in the morning. Yeah, I'll see you first thing tomorrow morning. Bye. Morning. How's the new job? It's okay. I now know 24 different kinds of smears and 11 different kinds of bagels. I don't know if you noticed the bag on the counter, but figured out at least help with some day-old bagels. Great! Coffee? I'm gonna have to get another job. They promised me full time, but I... Well, I've got some good news. I have this casting director friend, Tommy, who said he'd be happy to meet you. I know some of the basics, head shots, getting into an acting class, getting an agent, but I'm sure he can point you in the right direction. It's all who you know. That's fucking amazing. Thank you. You're welcome, I'm glad I can help. Thank you You are a very good looking kid. Got the blonde hair, blue eye, whole thing going. So why do you wanna be an actor? That's a great question. Actually... Something within me, always just the ham and just wanting to get in front of people... - Okay. - At a young age. And you know, I'm good. I know it, and I just really want to follow that dream. Hmm. I've really got nothing to lose. Nope, nothing to lose. Nothing. So you're willing to do pretty much anything to reach that dream? He was brought up very religious, like crazy. Yeah. Yeah, I think I'd do just about anything. You know, there's something so incredibly commercial about you. I have six... I have at least seven projects I could put you on right now. I admire your tenacity. Come out to California, Hollywood with nothing, just the shirt on your back. It would be nice if there was someone on the inside who was helping you out, right? Yeah. I could do that, I would do that. I mean, you have no idea how thankful I'd be if you did that for me. It's insane out there. So many young men like yourself come here almost daily. They never have anybody like Tommy here to step in and help them. It's fine. See, you're a natural. It's so good, you're staying in shape I see. Strong, working out. Got your hair cut short. That looks good. All kinds of looks. You got a great look. What kind of stuff do you watch? What are we gonna send you out for? Streaming, movies? Ethan, I had a dream from God that you will one day know his love and grace. He can either hate the one and love the other or else hold the one and despise the other. You cannot love both God and money. Hey, this is Jim at the bagel shop. And where are you? We just can't have people coming in... Good morning, sleepy head. Al, what the fuck happened last night? Oh, well, it looks like you and Tommy really hit it off. I don't remember it. It's all blurry and fucked up. I think we had sex. Was that your first time? I lost my job. I was supposed to come in really early this morning and I didn't wake up till a couple minutes ago. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know. If I knew, I would've woken you up. Well, I have some good news. Tommy called and said he had an audition for you. It's really easy. All you need to do is do a self audition and send it off. I'll help. Tommy already emailed me the sides. I think he wants to see you this weekend. Al, I'm a little freaked out by Tommy. Well, Tommy can really do a lot for you. I kind of have a boyfriend. He lives here? I've never met him in person and he hasn't responded to any of my texts, so I don't really know what's happening with that, but. Well, Tommy mentioned he might also have some other work for you. Work, what kind? Well, I don't know. You'll have to ask him. He really likes you. I guess I'm a little bit of a lightweight, huh? Hi, I'm Ethan Bates and I'm auditioning for the role of Kevin. Thanks. I don't know what to say. I just wanted to speak to you ever since the first day of school. You're amazing and I wonder if you might just want to go out with me? I know it's weird and all, but really, could you just say yes? I mean, what do you have to lose? Is that okay? Great. Shall I make us some eggs? Check it out, streamers. I made it all the way to the Hollywood sign. I'll chat later. I gotta head out and keep exploring. I can't believe I made it this far. I'm at Capitol Records everyone, look at it. Why is it shaped like that, huh? Is it a record? I don't know, it's pretty sick though. I can't believe it. Sick. Does this look good or what? It's party time. I don't know why I'm so nervous. Just gotta make sure I don't get as wiped out as last time. That was really embarrassing. I wouldn't worry about it. Did I tell you how he's bringing this friend, a director? No, Al. God, now I'm even more freaked out. Hey, you two. It's good to see you. Al, good to see you. Thanks for having us. I've had a crazy week. I'm happy to be here. I need a cocktail. Hey, beautiful. You killed that self tape. You didn't get a call back, but there's so much more where that came from. You're just so natural. Your instincts are great. You're a talented man. And speaking of talent, this is Jonathan, an amazing film director. He's up and coming and always looking for new talents, comme ça. Hey Ethan, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. He's really good looking, right? Yes, yes very. So what can I get you two? Ah, whatever you're having. I'll have some vodka. Perfect, perfect. Actually, let's go do some shots. We're doing shots tonight. Hey, so where you from, man? I better not. I don't want to get as fucked up as last time. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is a celebration. You are going to be a big star, all right, with my help and Jonathan's help. You really think so? I know so. With a face like that, of course. So where are you from? Michigan. How long you been here? Just a few weeks. Having fun? - Yeah. - Good. Got family here? I don't really talk to my family all that much. So you need some friends here, right? It's good, it's good. We can be your friends. Okay guys, here we go, shots. All right, shots, shots, shots, shots. That's not for you. That is for you. Here we go. To Ethan. To Ethan. Ethan. That's some good stuff. Woo. So I have a perfect job for you and it's so easy. I've got these industry friends, directors and things like that. There are these parties coming along and they like handsome young men by their side. Emmy's are coming up, Oscars... SAG awards. Perfect, SAG awards. Just smile and be polite. It's a perfect opportunity for you. It's a great opportunity. You'd be with these big name stars. Get you nice suits. A nice haircut. You're hanging with industry professionals. You like that? Yeah. - Yes you do. - Yeah. - You like that. - Are you okay? He's fine, he'll be good. You'll be good, right? You're good. He should take a nap. All right? Ricky. Ricky. I'm impressed how you're handling yourself. Thank you. How long have you been doing this? Over a decade. Drugs, abuse, no education, no resources or employment opportunities. It's horrific what some of these kids have to go through. Something have learning or developmental disabilities or physical problems. One time I found this new intake in a parking lot behind a 7-Eleven pushing him himself around with a large stick. That's terrible. That's why I'm here. This is so important to me. I've been so close to being where these kids are. Me too. I was fortunate when I was thrown out of my house by my father, I had an auntie that took me in. She was amazing. That's good. I wasn't so lucky. As you know, most homeless youth or LGBTQ are thrown out of their families just for being who they are, or they run away 'cos they know they'd be rejected or killed. So they come to Hollywood with a dream and end up on the streets doing drugs or forced on 'em, sometimes even prostitution. Is that something you went through? Sometimes you just do what you gotta do. Eat up. You've only got 15 minutes. From Pastor Robinson, Jesus is with us in our darkest hour. Hey. I saw you on your phone. Hey, I can... If you want... It's so pure, you won't care about anything. So fucking good. You'll forget you're hungry. Hello, Mom? It's me, it's me. Yeah. No, I'm okay. Everything's going great here. I've got a couple auditions and you know, I think things are working out here. Yeah, yeah I know Dad doesn't give a shit. I understand. No, a friend let me use his phone. All right, Mom. Well, I gotta go. All right? I love you and I'll talk to you when I can, all right? Thank you. I don't feel anything. Just wait, just wait. Hang with me. I'll show you how to survive out here. How many transports do we have left to do today? Just one more intake. What's the deets on it? Well, let's get there early and have a coffee. It's a 19 year old female named Sarah and will be waiting outside at the 7-Eleven in Hollywood. Dispatch indicated she should have ID, so I'll check on that. Copy that. Coffee's on you rookie. Don't worry. 7-Eleven coffee, surprisingly good. Woo! Let's go! That's 40. Fuck you, fuck you pervert. Ethan, the devil comes like a thief in the night seeking who he may devour. Be careful, son. Don't let the devil entice you. I don't understand. I'm a good person. What the fuck? I'm so stupid. I just, I trust people. I believe them. I believe people and all these fucking guys just want is to just fuck me. My life has been so fucked up. A fucking fucked up religion. I just... All is not well. I've got no money. Nowhere to go. You know, I thought I'd hit rock bottom when... I thought I hit rock bottom. I didn't. I didn't. Hi, I was just wondering if you were busy. Sorry, I don't know what I'm doing. It's 40. Okay. Are you okay? I mean, you look... I'm fine. What happened to you? Someone stole my bags. I came here to be an actor. I was staying with this guy for a while. I had to leave in a hurry. It was really messed up. You hungry? Okay, here you go. So are you you clean? No. No drugs. No, sir. I mean, yeah. Yes, I'm clean. Good, good. Go ahead. I'll get you cleaned up, okay? That would be nice. I haven't had a shower in a while. No, no! Stop! You can't have my phone, no, no, no, no, no! I haven't heard from you in weeks. I am so scared of what might be happening. Ethan, please. Please just tell me that you're all right. It's all been a lie since I got here. I haven't been posting the truth. I have nothing. I have fucking nothing. Andy, Andy? It's so good to see you. Oh my God. Ethan, is that you? What the fuck happened to you? What the fuck happened? Oh my God. I'm gonna help you, I promise. I'm gonna help you. Shit. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Morning. Running already? Imani, we are code red this morning. We were notified that the new intake has no identification, but he'll be with an old program graduate, actually my first intake with my trainer. Oh. Yeah, it's pretty amazing. A real success story. Makes like mega bucks as a competitive gamer, whatever that is. Always the first to help another. Dear heavenly father, I know that he is lost. But there is no "lost", in your loving arms. Take him back, dear Lord, take him into your loving arms. Let him know, that you are his savior. Bring him back to you. Ricky, an old friend. Your name is Ethan Bates. Is that correct? Ethan Bates, my name is Raymond. This is Imani. We're here to help you. You understand? Did Ricky fill you in on what we do? Basically. The only way to find him is through you, dear God. Dear God, bring my son back to me. Take him back into your arms. Let him know that you are the source of all things. That you are love, that you are forgiveness. Cast out the devil with his hands on my son. Cast him out. Dear Lord, I beg you. I beg you. Give me my boy back, dear Lord. I am your humble and loving servant. But dear Lord, I am a mother too. Let me know the touch, the fellowship of your child of God. Dear lord, dear God, dear lord, dear lord. Take him, hold him. Dear lord, I trust you. I love you, I am yours. Amen. When I was young, jacked meant that primarily adults who drank tea or coffee would still practice in the church and they would be called Jack Mormons, but it evolved and it changed. And suddenly it didn't just mean that. It meant that anybody who didn't go to church or identified as gay or different, that they were Jacked Mormons and that there was something wrong with them. I thought I had something wrong with me. But I know that I didn't. I had something special and I wasn't a Jacked Mormon because I knew how to ask for help. And I'm proud I did. The only thing that we can do sometimes is ask for help. There's nothing wrong with that. If anything, it's your strength because there are a lot of people who don't know how to ask for help. And there's a lot of people who go through life thinking that they don't have to, or they don't need to, or they can't, and that's wrong. Everybody should be able to ask for help and get to the help that they need. Everybody should be loved. My name is Nathaniel David Bates, and that was based off of my story.
