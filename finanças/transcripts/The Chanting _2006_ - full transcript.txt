MVP Pictures presents... ...a movie by Rizal Mantovani. '' THE CHANTlNG '' Honey, did you have another dream? Sam, was it the same dream? Samantha... l don't know what more l can do. Sam! Come on, keep me company. Your mom has passed away. Don't think of me as your dad anymore. Pretty Sam! Boarding House Excuse me, Sir. Where's the house of number 23? Number 23? lt's usually beside number 22 You joker! lt's not in order here. They don't want to move their houses in order lt's too packed here. Which house are you looking for?. The boarding house. That's right. There is a house that rents out rooms. lt's on the edge, beyond that cemetery. You have to excuse me, Miss. l don't mean to scare you. But when you pass that tree, ask for permission What's wrong? lt's something that newcomers like you must do. lt doesn't apply with us, the local people lt's old stuff. Thank you, Sir Miss, there's a room for rent back here. lt's a nice house. lt's a big room, cool and very cheap. That's your house, Din! You rascal! lt's not like that Thank you, Sir You guys! That was a pretty girl Come on, let's play! You phoned yesterday, right? l'm Mrs. Yanti Samantha. ls this all you brought? This is the ground floor. The men's rooms are here. lt's quiet at this time of day. Some have gone to the campus or work. And some are still asleep. This place used to look like that. The Batik Factory Mangkudjiwo. Landlord's children and princesses lived here once. Sir! lt's okay if l have to start from the beginning. What's the use to continue this if the result is bad? This is something l know well What do you know about dreams? Don't worry, l have lots of sources that will support my topic. l'll finish the first chapter in a week. Then on to the second one. We can discuss it tomorrow The schedule is not for you to decide. How about in 2 weeks time? Don't tell me what to do! Sir! This is the painting of Raden Ndoro Ayu Sukmarahimi Mangkudjiwo. She's the great granddaughter of Penambahan Wiryocakti Mangkudjiwo. lt was made when she was young. She's still very fit nowadays. Sam, do you often pray? lt's all right. What's this plate for, Madame? Who put this dirty plate here? Maid! Please take away this plate. Are you renting a room here? Be careful, you can be like me. l've been here too long and got too comfortable. l can't leave now. l'm Dinda Sam. That's cool. Do you sell this? l want it Take a look in my room. Goodbye. The owners have closed the second floor for a long time. Don't try to enter it. There are not many rules here but you must abide by them. You rent a room here it means that you are living in someone's house. There are 10 rooms here but only two bathrooms. You have to wait your turn. But if you really need to go to the bathroom... ...you can use the one in the courtyard. There. Can l have the front keys? l have a night classes. l'll get home around 1 1 to 12 o'clock Yes. This room is bigger than the rest. But the rate is the same. lf you bring a television, computer or air-con, the rate is different. You have to pay for the electricity. This the Mangkudjiwo antique mirror. Not all rooms, have it. lt's beautiful. You rascal Damn you. l'll be going now. Why did you change your thesis to The Paradigm of Dreams? l can discuss it intensively with my girlfriend. Gung, you have to graduate first before you can interpret her dreams. Enough, what did you get? Was it hard for you to find this place? Not really. But the entrance is a bit confusing. Can if l pay the rent tomorrow? Okay. You're from Jakarta, right? Why do you need to rent a room? My parents have passed away. l'm on my own. This house must have a long history. l suppose so. There was a fire, a couple of years ago. The building next door was a batik factory. This was their dorm. Did a lot of people die? This floor is only for girls. No men allowed. lt brings bad luck. lf she has the same dream over and over again... ...you have to do something about it. You'd better read this book. l think your girlfriend has an overdose of dreams. lt doesn't originate from her subconscious realm. lt comes from another realm. Read it. lt's fascinating. You're good. Where did you get this book? You do have a weird collection of stuff. Too bad l can't see that haunted tree near the cemetery. Don't believe in what the people around here say. Some call it the ''kuntilanak'' tree. What nonsense. ''Kuntilanak''? That's just a myth from our parents' era. My grandmother use to scare me with it. When l was naughty and came home late. My grandma would say to me.. Beware, you'll be kidnapped by the ''kuntilanak''. That's just nonsense. Did you know? A ''kuntilanak'' laughs like this... That's a good impression. lf her laughter sounds close to us, it means she's still far away. But if her laughter sounds fading away... ...that means that she is near you. You said ''kuntilanak'' doesn't exist. But now you're saying... You can summon a ''kuntilanak'' with this chant. What's wrong with you? You look like you've seen a ghost. Do you believe in ''kuntilanak''? They don't exist. lt's just a myth. Anyway, even if l sang it many times there's no way she will come. The only person who can summon her, is the one with the special gift. Miss! Miss, someone is looking for you Tasya, get in the house. lt's maghrib now Yes, Mom. l'm already on my way there. lt was dark. There was something burning behind me. There were three objects in front of me. lt was a plate, a stone and a pair of scissors. The theory states that the color black relates to fear and anxiety. Was the color blue there? Blue? The pair of scissors were kind of blue. l always wake up screaming. l have a bad feeling about this. People near my boarding house say there's a ''kuntilanak'' in the tree. l'm confused Lately you've been bottling up your feelings. How long will you be like this towards me? l don't what more l must do to make you forgive me. l want to go home now. Straight ahead. Come on. That's just right. Here will do. Why did you pick this place? lt difficult finding a parking spot. lt's cheap. lt's only temporary. My savings is diminishing. l have to get a part time job. Don't worry, l'll take care of your car. lt's my job here. Remember, don't take too long. Not longer than an hour. Others need the space. Unless you get what l mean Yes. Take good care of it Okay. Wow, she would make a perfect third wife for me. Don't stare at it, Gung Why not? Just don't stare at it! Just escort me here. l don't feel comfortable with the others. All right. l'll go now Gung, don't look at the tree. All right. Positive and negative. You have it. Even he does too. This room has many negative energies. Also with this many antiques... But doesn't it mean... l saw two beings back there. But you don't have to worry. They won't bother us if we don't disturb them. Damn you l can't go to sleep You're scaring me! A new kid. Can l see your hand? Hey, you said you'd read my fortune. You spend too much money. Sometimes when you're in a crowd, you feel lonely, right? That's right Anyone can spend too much money and be lonely. Don't be fooled by him! Sorry l didn't pay the rent yesterday lt's okay. Goodness, Sam. Don't put this chair facing the corner. Bad luck. Why is that? lt's all right. Just don't do it, okay. Take a look at this. What do you think? There are a few possibilities, Gung. lt could be drawing of a root. lt relates to a tree. Was there a tree nearby there? l got it from a tree. Why does a tree have a tile? Tiles! Come on, play! The tree was quite huge. lt's surrounded by a fence and it's in the middle of the cemetery. lf l had to pass a cemetery to get to my boarding house... ...there's no way, man! My turn. The boarding house is big and unique. lt has three floors. You get free laundry too. Sam said that the family who owned it was... ...the Mangkudjiwo family Mangkudjiwo? Agung, that's no family but a satanic ancient cult. They still exist, Madame. The owner still takes care of the place. That's strange. As far as l know, that cult had ended. ln the old times, they had many factories. But they seemed to have disappeared now. They were finished off by the locals and the authorities. They were against that satanic cult. You heard it wrong, Gung Got you, Gung. Don't forget to drink your medicine Yes, Mom. lt's just a cold. A tree? ''Kuntilanak'' lives in a tree ''Kuntilanak''! Here! That's right. The people there say there's a ''kuntilanak'' there. ''Kuntilanak''... l have a picture. Some say that she's half woman, half horse. Here's the picture, Gung No need. There are many ''kuntilanak'' in Sumatera and Kalimantan. Some have children and some steal babies. ln East Java, people use them to get rich. Hey, man What? l have a friend. His mother once said to me, ghosts... You're too noisy ''Kuntilanak'' lives in trees. lf it wants to go out, it'll come out through another way. Go out? What do mean by that? Go out to our world. lt lives in a tree but comes out through other ways. lt can come out from a wardrobe, chest or antique objects. lt can come out from anything Give it to me. lf that fenced tree is really a ''kuntilanak'' tree.. Wait a minute. lf there's really a ''kuntilanak'' at Sam's boarding house... ...then where does it come out from? l've got one more. Let's compete wits. Anik's mom has 5 kids. What's the name of the youngest? Wrong! One more time. Anik's mom has 5 kids. What's the name of the youngest? You fool. Of course, Anik! That's a good one. Sam, wait! No need to escort me. You're in a hurry to meet your Professor. Why make a fuss this late at night? That. What? l have a man in my room. l do that every day. So what? Do you think it's wrong? No. Sorry, l just wanted to get some sleep Sleep? Did you say sleep? Do you want me to make you sleep forever?. You're new here. Don't be such a smartalec! What are you doing? Enough, Honey. Let her be. Let's find another place. Why did you bring a guy here? lt's not allowed. Get out now! What's up? Sam, what's... Next time use a condom. lf you don't have any, just ask some from me. Damn that new kid. We were just getting started. Where are we going? l have a bad headache. Come on, let's find a motel that rents hourly. There's a lot. My nose won't stop bleeding. They didn't pay again. The borders are always like that. l need to go to the can. Sit down there. Here. Where are you going? Don't fuss. l'm going to get some wine. Don't leave me alone. l'm afraid to be on my own. What's wrong with you? You're acting like a kid. There. Did you hear it? l heard someone laughing. But it's far away Don't fuss. l'll go now Hey... The victim was having fun at the hotel when this incident occurred. The victim's body was find with her twisted to the back. The victim's name was Mawar Sibarani and was last seen alive... ...at her boarding house in the suburbs of Jakarta. This is Minnie Rosala, for SlLAT news. ls it over?. Yes. l told them that they were drunk. They were drunk but still went out on a motorcycle. How did Mawar's head get twisted like that? l don't have a clue. Something's not right, Dinda. What happened? Let's chat in my room. You wanted to see my work. Madame, excuse me. But have you heard the news? Someone's life and death. Who can guess what will happen? Yesterday l wished that she would die. What? Nothing. l got it from Celak. You won't find this is Kuta and Legian. lt's quite cheap. l'll pick some nice ones for you. You have one too lt's cool, isn't it? Mrs. Yanti said there are only four of them Four?. ln here, your room, Ratih's room and one more... Could it be on the second floor?. Maybe. lf you buy three, l'll give you one more free. Why were you vomiting yesterday? l'm all ears if you need to talk. We're both from broken homes. A pretty girl like you. Stay in the boarding house. You don't have much belongings. You're not like Mawar. l bet you got into an argument with your parents. lt's my step-dad. l don't want to live with him. My mother passed away recently What about a boyfriend? l have one. But it's like this. l love him but l don't know if he's trustworthy or not. Sam. Someone is looking for you. Agung. Sam!

What's wrong with you? l don't know. l wasn't certain at first but then when there was a second victim. lt's a good thing that accident happened at Kuningan. Far away from here Why did you chant that Durmo? You know not to chant it recklessly Forgive, Madame. l have acted irresponsibly lt's fate that the chanting chose her. l want to meet that child. Alfon died! His car slipped. He was a mess, his head twisted backwards. Alfon is dead? Alfon died. Was it because of me? That's Sam, Madame. Sam? Let me introduce to you, this is Madame Sukma. You're wearing a scarf on a hot day like this? Sam! Excuse me, who are you? You don't need weaklings like him. Excuse me, who are you? Gung! Good afternoon. Sam, do you feel cold after you have these dreams? Cold? l mean do you feel cold from within, not from the outside Wang! Don't be ridiculous l'm serious. According to this old script... ...if you feel cold after you have the dream. lt means something comes out. But if you feel hot, something comes it. Sorry, Sam. After you dream, do you remember your mom? No. Damn you. What? Don't ask questions like that lt's important. lf it's true, it means that she is deeply traumatized. l got the book about Mangkudjiwo. l just want to help her too.

Don't be offended by it, okay. l always feel guilty. You never look me in the eyes when we talk. What's wrong with you? Something's wrong with you! You're becoming more distant with me. Why do you forgive me... ...if you won't forget about it lt isn't about you, anymore. l need some time! Till when? You can't let it hang like this. l need some assurance You want some assurance? When l need you, l wasn't sure where you were. You knew my mom was very ill and l had a bad feeling about it. But you still chose to go out with your friends Sam. Forgive me, Sam. And then my mom passed away. Where were you then! Where! Now you want assurance? l should be asking that from you! You still think of that. What more must l do? What more must l do? Just leave me alone. Sam, l love you. Leave me alone! Sam! Leave me alone! Don't make her come! Sam... Hey! Come out if you dare! Madame? Maybe he slept over at his friend's house, lwang. He's not there? This confuses me too. l'll try to get in touch with him too. We'll keep each other informed. Good afternoon, Madame. This is the mailbox for the number... Come now, Sam. Don't deny it anymore. You know that you still love him. Don't be pessimist. Agung will come home soon. Yes, Madame. Goodnight. Maybe he's giving you time to be on your own. lt's what you asked for, right? He's never done this. Never. Sam... Gung... Sam, help me Gung? Gung, where are you? Help me, Sam. Gung... Sam... Don't even think about it! Sorry. l heard... There's nothing there! l told you never to open that door. Get back to your room at once! Gung, where are you? Please forgive me. l'm not trying to scare you but you have to check the hospitals too. l did already, he's not there. There hasn't been any news from him. You're making me confused. Why are you always asking about him? Of course, l'm concerned too. You like my boyfriend, right? What? Why do you say such a thing? You do like him. When l first introduced him to you. The way you approached him. You have the hots for my boyfriend? What's wrong with you, Sam? What's with you? My nose is bleeding again Dinda, you have to get away. You're in danger. Who's that laughing? Who's that laughing? Damn you! Dinda's dead! Just let it be. l'll take her to her mother's place in Garut. Let her rest in peace. Sam! Why are you still here? Dinda's death was horrible. Agung is here. l'm going to find him You're out of your mind! Sam, help me. Sam, help me. Have mercy. Sam... Have mercy Gung... God, help me. Gung! What happened to you? Help me, Sam. This way, Gung. Come on, let's get out. How many times must l say it to you? You have to distant yourself from these weak humans. For many decades the Mangkudjiwo dynasty... ...has used the ''kuntilanak'' to get rich. ln this house, we gave them human sacrifices. So that the ''kuntilanak'' would still be under our command. Everyone died in the fire. lt was the end of the Mangkudjiwo lineage. l don't have any children. No one can continue the chant to summon the ''kuntilanak''. But you have that gift. lt's only natural for you to be scared at first. You can't control this huge power within you yet. This power can fulfill all your desires. l didn't mean to hurt them. You can take revenge now. You can curse the people that you hate. You just have to learn to listen to what your heart wants you to do. ln your deepest dark side. ln the end, you can get everything you wish for. Everything. Yes, Madame. Sam, don't listen to her! Sam, snap out of it! Wake up, Sam! lt's me, Sam! Fight it, Sam! Sam, fight it! l'm not strong enough. Sam, you can do it. You're strong enough. You can do it, fight it! You've endured a lot. You can definitely overcome this, Sam! Sam! Don't get close to her. You have to accept the reality that you have the gift. lf you let me teach you, you will gain lots of wealth. The strong will be the keeper. No! l won't carry on the legacy of the chant of the ''kuntilanak''! l'll report about your ''kuntilanak'' activities here! So this is how it is. This is my first experience. This a young girl's doing. Madame. Please help me. l don't want to die yet, Madame. l'm not ready for it What must l do? Break all the mirrors! She comes out from there. Dinda's room. There are four mirrors! Madame? Mrs. Sri? Samantha! Help me, Madame! l'm not ready. Help me, Madame! Be strong, Sam. The strong will be the keeper. The strong will be the keeper. Forgive me, Gung. Sam... The doctor has allowed you get up and walk again? l found you a cheap rent room downtown. Why do still stay here? Come here, Gung. The air is nice here. You haven't felt it yet.
