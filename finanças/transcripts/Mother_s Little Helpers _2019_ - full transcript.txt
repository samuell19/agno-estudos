You know what takes up so much space and luggage? Jackets. - I hate it. - Dave, can you come here a minute? What's up? You okay? I knew it! I knew it! I knew it when we were doing it. - I love you. - Oh, my God. I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. It was the night after Alex and Jane's place, by the way. I called it. - It was New Year's Eve. - Well, come on. Yeah. So you think we should wait and tell people this time? Oh, we wait. Lesson learned on that one, right? Someone keeps calling me. Shut up. No one's gonna take our moment, no matter what. God, who the fuck is calling me right now. - It's my fucking mom. - Don't answer it. Don't... - I know, I... I haven't been... - Don't let her do this to you. Don't let her do this to us. - Do I go? - No, you should definitely... - Goddammit, she keeps calling like six times. - Oh, God. - I'm just gonna fucking take it. - I see. Hello. You what? Okay, okay. Can you just give me a minute and I'm gonna talk to Jude, I'll talk to the girls and then I'm gonna call you back, okay? Okay. Bye. - No. - She said that she is dying. Oh, come on. You do not... need to unfuck every situation. You have three siblings. Yeah, but if she is then, like... Someone doesn't have to be my wife and my child. - Love you. - I love you. I gotta go. - Okay. Go, go. Okay. - I have to leave. Are you gonna take care of yourself? I'm annoying. - I'll take care. - Do what you need to do - and I gotta find my jacket. - Okay. Okay. Fuck. Jude. Jude. - What were you doing outside? - Nothing. Doesn't your ankle bracelet alarm go off when you go outside? - I was in the driveway. - Who is that? A friend. From where? Grindr. Mom says that she has cancer. - And you believed her? - That's exactly what I'm saying. Listen, Jude, could you just make sure this does not roll onto her shoulders again? Are you available to maybe go visit her? Low battery, recharge unit. - Okay. - My guy is here. KXRF getting the lid out on a Friday with a Led Zeppelin rock bloc.

Good bye. You've reached the office of Dr. Lucy Pride. If this is an emergency, please hang-up and dial 911. Otherwise, leave a message after the tone. Mom. I'm still shocked that you're here. What's going on? What'd the doctor say it was? Mom, you called your kids and you told them that you were dying of cancer - but you didn't actually go to the doctor. - No, I do not go to the doctor, you know me, - and that is not a thing that happens. - Mom, the thing is is that you don't actually know if you're dying of cancer or not. - So... - Oh, like... like... like I'm lying? It could be pneumonia and then we could just give you antibiotics, or... Or you could rattle off names of all kinds of diseases from here to next week. You could do that. - What does that even mean? - It's a waste of time. You could have died in a... in a plane crash on the way here. We don't know what... we don't know. But something's gonna get every last one of us. Okay? And I... I got the drugs. I got that taken care of. You know that's right. You know that's right. Can we just go to the hospital right now? - Does the van work? - I don't know if the van works or not. Good luck with that. I don't know where my keys are. Smartypants, I don't... I don't miss that at all. She hasn't even gotten her test results, so, you know, we'll see what's actually going on. I... I just worry about you. You promised you're gonna take care of yourself. I will. Oh, I did try calling my aunt. Aunty Trashcan is off the map. My mom got some interns to help with organic worm farming. Well, I'm just really worried about you. I don't want her to bring you to the dark side. Hello. - Hi, Dr. Watson. - You got to see this mushroom. Yeah. How long do you think? Hello, can you hear me? Hello. Hi. - Hi. - Hey. Hi, Julia. So amazing. Oh, my God. We're all on this thing. Wow, I haven't seen you in so long. This is so amazing. You guys do this all the time? - No. No, we definitely don't. - Yeah. I do. - Where are you right now? - I'm at Mom's house. - Hey, Sadie, you're at Mom's house right now? - Mm-Hm. Yeah, where is she? Can we say hi to her? She's asleep. Um... I wanted to call you guys, I don't want to, like, do any like grapevine calling but, um, I talked to the doctor. She has lung cancer. It's stage four. Wait, I can't... I cannot hear. I can't hear anything with... hey, Jude, can you... I can't... their munching is a lot. I can't hear... Can you... Jude, can you just... Jude, get off your fucking phone, dude. What the fuck. You guys... you guys just shut the fuck up and listen. Mom has stage four lung cancer. She's gonna die. - You need to calm. I can't hear you. - What? Mom has stage... oh, my God. - Please, I... just please let Sadie... - You guys, Mom has stage four lung cancer and she's gonna die. So this is the time where you stop making it all about you. She's gonna be dead. She's not gonna remember. And you're gonna have to live with whatever the fuck you decide to do. So you can come here and do the right thing and come to Texas or you can just fucking continue being obsessed with yourselves. That's a really shitty way to tell us, Sadie. Way to go. Yeah, really good work there. - Well... - I'm gonna go. No, no, no, no, Jude, can you stay here for just a minute? - I'll see you guys later. - Hey, Jude, can you stay - for just a... - Wait. Alright, I'm gonna go, too. I love you, guys. Bye. I don't know how to hang up on this. I don't know how to stop the thing from going. - Can you come? - Huh? I'm saying everyone's hanging up and... and you guys spent 20 minutes trying to get me on this Google, this Hangout thing, and now I don't know how to... I don't even know how to press no. You just click the red button. Just move your... move your mouse down and then there's a red circle, just wiggle it over the red circle. What red button? There's a... just wiggle your mouse. Do you know what... like, find the arrow and then push the red button. It's Paul's laptop. I don't even understand. I mean this took so long to get me... Yeah, it's real, it's happening. And looks like I'm gonna be here a while. None of my siblings are coming. Don't internalize it, all right? Don't let it go to your... Sadie, what I think I'm trying to say is I love you and I am worried. I know you're trying to help but you're not. So can we just change the subject? She saw us all the band photos from the '70s when she was still out on tour. You're a wonderful daughter, whatever she says. You know you're tired and I am so tired. We never know this might be your last night. Can we take a selfie before you go to sleep? Gross. Yes. - Without your tube? - Yes. Yes. Am I gonna kill you if I take it out of your face? - Please. - I'll put it right back down. - Does that feel okay? - It feels great. Okay. We need something to show the kids. - Is this really happening? - Yeah, we are doing it. This is what's happened to photography. Yeah, I am a professional, so I do actually know what I'm doing. I may not have taken any famous record covers, yet, like you, - but I do do it for a living. - That's beautiful, honey. I actually canceled a shoot to come to you. - So you'll lose the money? - A lot of money. Now I feel guilty. I remember like... putting a camera in your hands one time. I remember that. And I remember how excited you were. Yeah, that makes sense that you're doing this. Yeah, and I would like get the cats and dress them up in Lucy's baby clothes. It was a big deal. - Yeah, it is a big deal. - I'm a big deal now. I mean not as big a deal as you but... So what are you shooting? Weddings mostly. Well, you know, got to start somewhere. - They're cool. - They're cool weddings? Yeah, I... all my weddings look like band albums. I mean I was published like in the New York Times and had a lot of blog, you know, coverage this year. It was actually a really good year. I mean don't settle. Keep dreaming. You got your whole life ahead of you, I mean... you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Paycheck is a paycheck, don't get me wrong, but I'm just saying. You grew up in this house. Okay? Can I get a hit of your oxygen? I'm feeling a little... Thanks, Mom. - I'm tired. - Me, too. Maybe we've been too hard on you. Not now, Sadie, Mom is not feeling good. Sadie, I know you can make yourself a bowl of cereal, I've seen you do it. Mama is sleeping, go ask your aunty. Go find Aunty Trashcan, alright? Go find Aunty Trashcan. - I have a request. - Okay. I'm just wondering if maybe I could move this to my mom's house so that I could take care of her. I mean that's definitely within reason. I mean your mom's not doing so hot and, yeah, like, I don't see why they wouldn't approve something like that. And then like... look at that. - It's like an app. - Eww, wait, what? It's an app for plastic surgery. But what... is she carrying that or did - she just get that done? - No, that's like post-op. Sh. - Okay, chill the fuck out. - Dude. - Can you not be talking about... - She can't hear anything. Okay, okay, you need to calm down. I haven't seen her in a long time. I don't want you - to be talking about... - Shut out. - I just don't want to be talking... - Okay. You all be quiet, I'm trying to sleep. Hi, Mom. Good morning. - Hi, Mom. - Hi. - Hi. - Look at Mommy. - Hi. - Julia, where is she? How are you, Mom? What are you all doing here? Chill me a little bit. Hi. - Hi. - Hello, honey. Hi. Hi. - Oh, not you too. - Hey, you too. Not you too, little sneaky little thing over there. - Hi, Mom. - Hi. You look so good. I would... you would never know. Boy, you hadn't changed a bit. Alright. No. No. Y'all, this is so funny that y'all are all here right now 'cause it reminds me so much of this one time... well, one of many times, whatever... when Van Morrison was coming through and we used to go to every concert, you know, you all know that, and... anyway, - Van Morrison, I was backstage... - Uncle Van. Yeah, he used to put me like on his shoulders. - He was funny. - It was the Grateful Dead. Yeah... I can't... you know what, I think it could have been. - It could have been. - That's what you told me. I was there. It was Van Morrison. Anyway, it was a band... - Could have been either one. - ...they came to her house and had some fun and I woke up and they were all there. And that's what reminds me... that's what brings me back to this moment. Nurse is here. I don't need a nurse. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? - Good. - Hi. - Hey, buddy. Hi Ms. Pride. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? - I'm... I'm good. I'm fine. I'm fine. You know... you know you should put that back in, alright? - Okay. - Yeah. You need to get your oxygen. - I know. - Yeah. Let's go ahead and check your level. No, I haven't stuff off my nostrils. That stuff up your nostrils is gonna help you breathe. - Okay. Yeah, alright. - Let's go ahead and I'll check this for you. - Yeah, so your oxy is a little low... - Okay. - I'm really gonna need you to keep that in, okay? - Okay. Can I have a talk with you guys? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Come back here. See you. Okay. Bye-bye. You keep that thing in your nose. - Okay. - Okay. - Thanks, Lucy. - Love you. No, no, no, that's my seat. That's my seat. - Are you serious? - Yes. - Oh, my God. - What do you mean? That's your seat. - Your name is Nurse Cool? - Is that your real name? - That's so cool. - That's a great name. Wait, do you have to deal with people doing that all the time? - Um, yes. - Thank you. I get it 'cause, you know, I like to keep myself calm. I'm very calming, so. - Yeah, and cool, okay. - Let's get started here. So, these are your... your... your mom's final days and I'm here to help you guys prepare for that. And everyone needs to do their part, alright? Your job is going to be to help keep her comfortable, to administer her medications. - I'll do that part. - It's very important. You and I can... talk about that afterwards. - You have experience in that field? - She's a doctor. - Oh, you're a doctor? - I am. Excellent, she's gonna be taking opioids. And we want to keep - the dose on a time schedule. - Yeah, I know that. I get it. We're gonna need someone to take her vitals. This, that I've been using here, tracks her blood oxygen level. You just put it on her finger like this. Also you're gonna want to start thinking about funeral arrangements or funeral homes. I have a list that I can suggest. And I want to suggest this book. It's called Gone from My Sight. It talks about the dying experience and it helps the family cope. They give the book to everyone, it's just like Dying 101. Also I'm gonna ask that you guys do a caring journal. I think that's very important. You can just jot down how you're feeling. - You can keep one... - I am not doing the journal. Not everyone has to do a journal. You don't have to do a journal. I will do the journal. I would just like just to be able to do as, like... I want to be able to know that we've done absolutely everything, like, when Mom dies, I don't want in a few months from now we hear about like a... like a drug that, you know, we didn't know about or we didn't do the research on, I know that you're doctor and you're nurse but, like, have you, like, had any experience with crystals or, like, certain incense, like some oil... I mean I don't think incense is the best... - she has O2 machine but it's okay. - Okay. It's okay. I'm gonna leave you my card. If you guys have any questions at all, - I want you guys to call me. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thanks, Cool. Thanks, Nurse Cool. - Hey, how's it going? - It's good. I wanted to make sure that everything's working... working out with your move with your mom. Yeah, they are. Um... thank you for setting this up for me. I appreciate it. Yeah, you got it. You got it. Well, look, this is a routine call. I just wanted to make sure that, uh, you're in your new location and everything's good. Yeah. So what's going on with you? Just, uh... just checking up with my clients. That's what I call my... my perps. Oh, am I a perp? Well, look, I... I just wanted to call and make sure that you... are okay. And... I'll be making these calls every so often just to make sure you're doing what you need to be doing. And it sounds like you are. I will talk to you again later. - Alright. - Bye. Bye. Mom wants to throw a party. Okay. Okay. Okay. This book, dude, is freaking me out. What to expect when you're expecting someone to die. We got a checklist. - Irregular breathing. - Yeah. - Then it goes back to normal. - Maybe. - Surge of energy. - Possible. - Decreased blood pressure. - Not every time. Fish-out-of-water breathing. What the fuck is that? You know when you do your fish out of water and it tries to breathe. - That's awful. - I just feel like I'm like a loaded gun just waiting like, is this the surge of energy? Is that the breath? What's a blood pressure and like, you're just waiting for that second. Here's something that will give you no solace at all. People die in all sorts of different ways at anytime. What's it like when it's like it's? I had to lie to a family just the other day. I look at this guy and he's actively dying and the family is like, "Is there anything we can do to save him?" And I have to look this beautiful crying family in the eyes and make them believe that there is still some kind of hope. I notice like... feel like there's some sort of list, - like, I can just... - Fish out of water breathing? - Yeah. - Did you guys know grandpa? - I did not know. I had no grandpa. - No. Apparently, he sucked. Grandpa took me fishing and I remember he, like, took this beautiful fish out of the water. It's like... feel like it was called like rainbow trout and, like, so beautiful. I don't know if it was rainbow trout, but he, like, pulled, we were waiting all day and then he pulls this fish out and it was like this being and it comes up on just like, ah! And then it like... I just sat there and I just watched it... die on the dock, going bah... Yep, that's the breathing. Okay, alright. We'll keep an eye out for that. Adjust this slightly up, okay? - How high should I go? - Around eight. - Okay. - Around eight is good. See we're already seeing an increase. - Wee! - That'll do it. I don't mind him coming around. Hey, Mom. Mom. Yeah. - What? What in the world are you doing in here? - Just... - Taking inventory? - Taking inventory, yeah. Oh, good. Yeah, you got to count those pills. That really matters now, right? My little fancy Lucy. My little fancy doctor. Who would've thunk it, huh, one of my offspring become a doctor. Thanks, Mom. You know I still don't know if it was worth it or if I should have just dropped out and become a mime... Or be a painter, Lucy. Didn't have to just like so much more fun though than taking care of sick people like me. Gross. - I don't know how you do it. - I kind of find it fulfilling. Can you say the same about what you do? Ouch. - I... - Yes, you just went running as fast as you could in the opposite direction, I guess. Yeah, I definitely learned what I didn't want. - You're welcome. - I found it. Look at this! Look at this! - Look... - Sadie, what in the world... - Look at this. - You can snoop it around. I cannot believe that you found this. Oh, did you take this picture, Mummy? - I did. - I found the record. - Why, I'm certain... - I found the Joan Anne record. - The record? - The record. - Oh, my God! - Isn't that nice? Yeah. I know. I was just backstage - and right there. - Oh, my God! I'm here to tell you, it's like back in the day of Stevie Nicks, Joni Mitchell and Joan Anne. There she was. And there I was snapping away. The backstage, it's pretty awesome. Oh, my gosh. Do you guys remember when I dyed my hair to look just like Joan Anne and I did, I looked just like her. Oh, my gosh, Mom, and when I went off to college, - there is like this... - You went to college? Oh, my God, I went for two months. It was right before... Let's not talk about it. What we should be talking about is should Julia go blond again and as a blond, maybe you should stop wearing Crocs. - Ooh, interesting. Compelling argument. - Controversial. I have had so many conversations. I think I've had multiple conversations with each of you or at least one conversation with one of you about these Crocs. I am telling you, you have not even experienced this level of comfort and luxury until you put them on your foot. - It is like done. - None of us are gonna do that. - Do not... No. Do not do that. - What does... why... why won't you put your foot into the Croc? - Because it's a Croc. - You know what, Julia... - Just put your foot in it. - Excuse me. I've actually been thinking about this a lot. What I would really, really love is that when y'all lay my body down, okay... that you put those Crocs on my feet and bury me in those Crocs. That's what I want. Mommy, that would mean so much to me. You know that way I could rid the shame that those Crocs have brought to this family, for real. - Alright. - You know what I mean? That's not us. I didn't raise you that way, Julia. We're too good for Crocs. - You are not even a gardener. - Are you joking? Or do you want to be buried in the Crocs? Hey, we're just picking up worms for your mom. So you grab one. - Jesse, chill dude, why going so fast. - They're worms, dude. You're gonna put them in shock and they'll stop working. Hi, Mom. Hey, Julia. Hey, I made you a cup of tea. Oh, my God. - Thank you so much. - Of course. I was just dreaming about this cup. Mom, that's weird. That's so connected. I know. Julia, we've always had like that... like that weird, - like... - Like, I've always... I've always thought of you as a very powerful, you know, spiritual leader of the community. And I feel like right now more than ever you might be having some, like, Jesus like... I feel like you're a little bit like Jesus. But, Mom, I wanted to ask you, and you don't have to... you don't have to answer this if you don't want to. In fact... yeah, you know what, it's too dark. - Julia. - It's too dark. Julia, spit it out, honey. So, like, you're here now and soon you'll be taking a very exciting... vacation which you will never return from. I just wanted to know... I wanted to know your thoughts and opinions about how you would like to be buried and what type of religious ceremony you want to have. No religion whatsoever. I was thinking I could call the local parish - and see if they have somebody available. - Oh, hell no. no, no. No, honey, I don't believe in any of that crap. You're not gonna save my soul right now, if that's what you're trying to do. You told me you believed in God multiple times and I feel like you're backtracking on those... - belief systems maybe. - Oh, God, that was weird. - What happened? - No, it was like... it was like your face went back to like when you were six years old and then back to an adult and then back to six and then back to an adult. Oh, now that was weird. Mommy, I can't tell right now if you're being really cute if you're having an acid flashback or if you're dying. No. But I liked it. That was cool, like, to see you when you're a little. Not really. I was never much of a singer, Julia, but you used to listen to me and used to tell me I was good. I remember you being able to sing better than Joan Anne. Honestly, Mom, you're like a beautiful... Do you remember that song, it was like... ♪ This is a story About four wet pigs ♪ ♪ Two of them little And the other two big ♪ ♪ Two of them little And the other two big ♪ ♪ They danced all night At the big town jig ♪ You told me it was about the four of us. I remember that. ♪ Big as a barn And tall as tree ♪ ♪ Take them all down To the factory ♪ Yeah. ♪ Well, slice them into Pork chops Bacon and hams ♪ ♪ Squeeze them into sausage Pork spam spam ♪ ♪ Throw them little eyes Out in the rain ♪ ♪ Pickle them feet And scramble them brains ♪ ♪ Open their goodness That they never gave big ♪ ♪ It is though not At the big town jig ♪ I'm tired.

Just take a nap. ♪ My young love said to me ♪ ♪ My mother won't mind ♪ ♪ And my father Won't spite you ♪ ♪ For your lack of kind ♪ ♪ As she stepped away from me ♪ ♪ Till her wedding day ♪ That's our opener right there. Yeah, I liked it. - I think it's great. - That was great. That was beautiful. Definitely let's do it. Let's put it in the party. Julia sings opening number. And then I think, you know, we need... - can you be on food? - Yeah, I'll call that cornbread guide and get that barbecue. Perfect. And can you guys go call people through the Rolodex and that's just your divide and conquer. And then I can talk... - I don't know about that. - Just going through the Rolodex, - so just calling... - I don't want to do that. What if you take care of Mom and you just be her point person, just the go-to? Does that sound good? - Okay. - Okay. That's what I need to do. I'll do music. And then I think that we've got ourselves a fucking party. Fucking hootenanny. We have a fucking hootenanny. This is great, guys. This is awesome. Next performance. Here he goes, turpitude dance performance. I always thought your dancing was too sexy. I feel like when Jude would dance at school dances and stuff, it would be like... it would be like record scratch. Well, at least none of us danced on the pole, right? - What's up, Mom? - ♪ ...to the secretaries ♪ ♪ Sayin', "Here, now Mama, come on over here" ♪ ♪ Instead, I'm stuck Here rubbin' ♪ ♪ These fenders with a rag ♪ ♪ And walkin' home In soggy old shoes ♪ ♪ With them steadily Depressin' ♪ ♪ Low down mind messin' ♪ ♪ Workin' At the car wash blues ♪ ♪ You know a man of my... ♪ Get here in the back.

Your name is Jude, right? - Yeah. It's kind of... Hold on. - Oh, that feels great. - Yeah. Yeah. - No, it's not gonna. - What is... It's beeping. Goddammit. - Are we in reverse? - We can't. Just put me over. Yeah, got it. Do you prefer it from behind? - Yeah, I like that. - I don't like that. - This looks like this seats eight. - I know. Oh, wow. Oh, this is better. This is better. - Goddammit. - No, this is good. - No, I'm sorry. I can't. - Is someone breaking into your car? No. Just... just... One more... Yeah, yeah. - Very sensitive car, man. - Yeah. - That's good. - Yeah. - Is it your van? - No, it's my mom's van. Oh! oh! Oh, fuck. - Fuck. - Oh. Oh. Thank you. Hold on. Hold on. Oh, my God. You still going? This is roomy. What is this? This is not an Odyssey? Oh... - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. Alright. Bye. Hello. Hi. You okay? Yeah. Alright. Sorry, it's just I usually do the calling. Oh, yeah. Is this weird? Should I... this is weird. I shouldn't have called you. - I'm gonna hang up now. - No, no, no, no, no, no, it's... it's not weird, it's just... it's just uncommon. I guess I just hadn't heard from you in a few days and I wanted to check in. Well, I... I appreciate that. Usually, my checking calls are just once a week. - Oh. - But... thanks for being so proactive. Sure. How's your week been? It's been all right. How's your mom doing? What do you do? Like, what do you do when you're not like probation officer Sanchez probing people? Um... I don't do much really. I just don't believe that. I'm pretty boring. I have a dog. What is your dog's name? Janice. Your dog's name is Janice? That is the dumbest dog name I have ever heard. I mean that's the best you could come up with? I didn't come up with that. It was my niece. First time raising that's what she named her. - Do you have any pets? - No. I can barely take care of myself. I think you know that. I think you're doing pretty good, and I think you're taking time out to take care of your mom. Not everybody would do that. I don't want to go to AAA. It's a cult. My sister's in like fifty cults and she is insane. You don't have to go to AAA. - You just can't drink. - I think I'm a terrible person. You're not. You don't know me. I know that you've... you stopped your life so you can go and take care of your mom. That's pretty great. - Okay, I should go now. - Okay. Bye. I mean it just feels so good to be out of the house. I have been there for like days. There were things to do, man. - There were worms to play transforming. - Get your worms. - Gonna get your worms. - That's a good Mom impression. - Julia, thanks for driving. - Just trying to keep the sanctity of marriage intact. We just need a break. Thank you so much. - Later. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Thank you. - Bye, babies. Bye. Okay. Cheers to that. Whoop, alright, here we go, driving in the city. Sorry. Shit. My God. Oh, where am I? What street is this? What? Yeah? Oh! What? Uh... Oh, shit! Oh, my God! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Um... Hi. What is that noise? Shit. Hello, is there anybody in here? Hello? Lucy! Lucy! Fuck. Hold on, Mom, don't die. Hold on. What the fuck...? You fucking kidding me? Hi Nurse Cool, there's an alarm sounding and my mom's gonna die. Okay. Yes, I see it. It's at eight. Okay. Okay, Mommy. Okay. Ah! She breathes. Okay. Yeah, it stopped. It's... I mean you can hear it, it stopped. No, I do... I remember now that you told me. Yeah. Right. Totally normal. Thank you so much. And I will see you tomorrow. Fantastic. Handled it. Do you think that this was the thing that kind of did it? I think it was one of the things. It's like she was always trying to get back up to that mountaintop. Instead, she just dug herself into a hole. This one is so good. Oh, I'm okay, thank you. Why? Can you keep a secret? No! Love you. - How many months pregnant are you? - I'm like a week pregnant. - Oh. - I'm like, there's a possibility that it might stick. You're like don't blow weed smoke in my face pregnant. Aw. Is Dave so excited? He really wants it to stick this time. It will stick. Super anxious and stressed out people still have babies and super calm and chill and Zen yoga moms still have miscarriages. I think it'll be great. And I'm also certain - that you'll fuck up some of the time. - I'm... I'm prepared for that. Hi. How are you? I'm good. Bring it in, bring it in. I just had to come here and thank you for helping me through my first marriage. You were so great to me and you comforted me and you told me what a period was. Do you remember the El Camino? I do. You're like, I'm... I was just drinking my whole life, - drinking, that's a crime. - Who gives a shit, right? You're just starting out. Did you just high-five me? You're just always my hero. My hero. Well, one thing I do remember is you coming to the wedding carrying this giant box, wrapped in silver and gold, all sparkly, and inside is a big old boxy of wine. We smuggled a lot of illegal things in an open bed truck, - I tell you, God. - I have some happy news. - I'm on husband number two now. Thank you. - Oh, I like that. - We had a good luck, you know. - We did. - Didn't we? - Oh, hell, yes. I mean we were supposed to die a long time ago, weren't we? - Over and over. - Over and over. So I just wanted to thank you so much because I realized I never have. Oh, you don't have to thank me for anything. I'm glad I was there for you, honey. - Oh, my goodness. - Please say hi to my momma, please. Best party ever! Whooo!

I have a few tricks in my bag. - I got something to say though. - Yeah? Hey. Hey, you guys. - Cousin Bryan has got something to say. - Yeah, I do. Yeah, you know... - What are you talking about? - Something we never talked about. So I want to let you know how I feel about everything. You know, I was doing one of those... one of those south the border runs for you, and I drank a beer on the way back and then I didn't mean to fall asleep at the wheel but I did. And I'd never told you that, I appreciate you watching out for me. I'd... that concussion just knocked me out. So we had to have someone to watch over me for that 24 hours and it was you. You never said a thing. You never asked any questions. You didn't care about the car. And I just want to say thank you. - Repent. - I did some dirty deeds. Dirty deeds. Just let know that people really appreciate you and we all love you. - Thank you, Bryan. - Cheers. I remember that. Yeah, yeah, Mom always take care of Uncle Bryan and then I had to take care of you guys for a week and a half and I missed school and I had to repeat fifth grade. - Sorry. - You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm better than okay. There are people here today that I have not seen in over a decade. Danny Ray, where the hell did you find him? I can't believe he left Patty for an hour. It's a good party. It's a great party. I love you, Mom. I love you too, son. Jude. Honey. Could you do mama one more favor today? - Yeah. - I know you're worn out and you're tired, but, you know, I just feel like all these people came here today to see me and I kind of feel like I want to give them something. - Okay. - I want to give them some worms. Cousin Bryan, he... he bagged a bunch of them up for me. So all you got to do is hand them out. Wait, the librarian aged very well. - Oh, my God. - Come on. - Guys... - What? Did you know Mom and a librarian had a thing? No. I was just giving Mom her meds and I noticed that some of the pills are missing, some of her opiods. How many? I don't know, at least like a dozen, more. - That's serious? - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay. - So do you think somebody came in during the party, like, one of her fucking hippie friends? No, I... no one in the house. No one was in the house. Nurse Cool actually mentioned that the other day. - What? - What did he say? I thought he would have told you guys about that. - No. What did he say? - Oh... - he said that Mom's dailies... - Yeah. ...were all in order and that... but the bottle was missing pills. I don't even know where the bottle was stored. I don't... but he said there was missing pills. - You should have told us. - I thought that he was going to tell you. - He's the official... - Why didn't... why didn't he tell us? - Fuck. - I think I... It's fucking Jude, dude. He's like... like this fucking close to a relapse. You think Jude has been taking drugs? I mean, he had three DUIs, like, in six months, like... I told him that - I was going to tell you guys and I forgot. - Fuck. And I also... Oh, my God. Do you think it was him? Hey. You want to take this one? Mm-Hm. What's going on? I was giving Mom her medication and I noticed some of her... drugs are missing. Like, there was one rule I'd let you live in my house on one condition. - Wait, just... if you did... - No, no, - No, no, no, no... - Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. No, no, no. No. no, no, no. No! No, no, no. I did not. I did not. - I did not take those drugs. - Hey, that's okay. I don't know what you're talking about. That was somebody else. - Do not blame this on me. - And... and... that's okay. And if it was you, you could totally tell us and it would be fine. I would... I didn't... I... I pro... I swear to God. I swear to God. I swear to God, I did not touch anything, okay? So let's just forget this because this... this... this is... this is... this is bullshit. I am not... I am not, okay? I'm not... Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Good job. Good job. That was nice. - That was nice of you both. - Where are you going? - Where are you going? - I'm sitting down. - Do you want some ice cream? - Yes. - Hi. - You doing okay? No. I... my sisters are... - killing me. - First of all, why don't you tell me what's going on? I don't have... I don't have time to tell you what's going on. - Have you been drinking? - Fuck you. No, I have not been drinking. And I am going to if you don't get me out of here. We did a lot to get you moved, it's not gonna be that easy to move you right back. You're gonna have to work through whatever it is that you're going through right now. It was pretty easy for you to move me here in the first place. No, it actually wasn't. Do the thing again. Dude, I need you to breathe. I don't know what happened but it's just that's right now. You know what, you're full... you are full of shit. - Dude. - You are not being, um, - professional with me at all. - I know that you have a lot on your plate right now, okay? God, fuck you, I don't need a fucking therapy session. Fuck it. Bye. God fucking. Goddamn. Hi. You need this? Yeah. Yes, yeah. Yes, I do. I can't... leave. I can't stay. I can't fucking get high. I can't... Welcome home. Tell me what's going on? I'm fucking up. I'm doing everything I can not to fuck up and I still... fuck up. This isn't a party. This is a fucking... pageant. Siamese cat party. What? Siamese cat. Mm-Hm, I heard you. - What are you talking about? - Like a Rolling Stone. I have no idea what you're saying. The lyric from "Like a Rolling Stone." Back in the day, the Hells Angels, they... when they were running drugs, they used to put a Siamese cat on their shoulder to distract the drug-sniffing dogs. - What are you saying? - What are you not getting? What the fuck is a Siamese cat had to do with this bullshit? The worms. Oh, my God, do I have to fucking pull it out of you? Just tell me. - Under the worms... - Yeah. ...is... Drugs? She's been mulling drugs... our whole life. Fucking... I could have had... I could have had drugs. I could have had drugs. I could have had free drugs. Fuck you. Lying fucking sack of shit. Yeah, but us accusing him might... I think we should just clean up and let him... - What if it's not him? - Let him learn how to use... Jude. - Jude. - Jude. Jude. What are you doing? Why you have the worms in here? What are you doing with the... Is that a big bag of weed? - Shit. - What? Wow! - Don't touch it. Don't get your prints on it. - Are you okay? My prints? Is that a huge bag of cocaine? Is this yours? It's Mom's. Mom's doing coke? She's been smuggling drugs through us for years. - What? - Aunt Trashcan told me. She's been smuggling drugs underneath the worms for years. Wait, what do you mean? She... I mean that everything she's ever told you, everything she ever pretended to be for you is a lie. And I've been telling you this for years. Wait, she used to... she sent me on the school bus. Yeah, I delivered worms all through high school. I did it, too. That's what you came back here for. You guys, I'm pregnant and I don't wanna have a baby in jail. I want to have it at home with my husband. - So I'm gonna get the fuck out of here. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Oh, that's great. Okay. Well, I am leaving too. - Oh, wait, I can't. - We gotta go. - But Mom is dying. - I would like to not have my medical license, which I have had for six months, revoked. - No, you're not leaving. - Six months ago. - Nobody's leaving this house. - We can't stay. - Nobody is leaving this house. - Julia, you're being crazy. We are staying in this house, we are helping our mother die. Because that's what we're gonna do as sisters and brothers. Okay? Because we love each other. And this week has been... absolutely the best week of my entire life. Oh, my God, you sound like a fucking crazy person. Are you serious? Do you understand how much we have to lose? I don't give a fucking shit how much we have to lose. You listen to me, little pipsqueak? We are staying in this goddamn fucking house together, otherwise I go to the police and I fucking tell them and we all go to prison. That's twenty years for you, twenty years for me, twenty years for... actually you'd be like two life sentences. And I'm not going back to Paul. I am not going back to my life. And I am not going back to that Paul because you guys don't you understand I've been trying to get us... back together... ever since Mom left the first time. And I have been taking the drugs, not Jude. Oh, God. - Yeah. - You've been acting kind of high this whole week. - I'm sorry. - I just thought it was your personality. I don't fucking know you. You're literally a different person every time I see you. You know what it's fine. How could you fucking do that to him? You ladies were pretty ready to point your fingers. I didn't exactly have to prompt you too hard on that one. Do you understand what's happening right here? We are being manipulated by her. This isn't between us. - I'm gonna fucking talk to her. - Every time you call me an asshole... Wait, Sadie, what are you doing? Sadie? - I'm gonna fucking talk to her. - Sadie. - Sadie. - It's okay. It's okay. Julia, fuck off. Fuck. Jesus. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom! Mom! She's alive. Hey, Mom. Pinch her right here, she hates that. - I'm serious. Pinch her right there. - Julia. Okay, this isn't good. Can you call Cool? Yeah, yes. Yes. Tell him we're gonna need more morphine. I don't understand how to open a cell phone. - I don't even... who is... - This is mine, here. Mom. Hi, Nurse Cool. Hi. - Mom, wake up. Wake up. - Hey. Hey, hey, hey. - Wake up. - Hey, hey, hey. She is unconscious. And Lucy wants to know if you can-you... if... that she can administer more morphine. ♪ Give me the night ♪ ♪ Just give me the night ♪ ♪ Just give me the night ♪ ♪ Just give me the night ♪ Okay, so Mom's comfortable. I've given her morphine and she's not going to wake up. - She's not gonna wake up? - No. So now what happens? We... we wait. It... it could take... hours, days, weeks. Weeks? There's no way to tell. What's gonna make her... Some people... wait for loved ones to visit them. Some people are waiting for permission. Some people even wait for forgiveness. If there's anything I can do, you guys have my number and I'm available, okay? - Okay. - Thank you, Nurse Cool. - You're welcome. - Thank you. Can I talk to you? I am really sorry about how I acted earlier. It's okay. I just don't really know how much you know about kind of how things went down. Is there something you think I should know? I just feel really guilty. - Why? - Because I... I want you to... not have to know, like, about everything. Tell me. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I was in college and I was trying to do my thing and I got a phone call from a social worker that you'd been taken from the house and that you were staying with Aunt Trashcan because Mom... had been arrested and... charged with possession with intent to sell. And she was sentenced to five to seven years, but she only served one year. And we lied to you when we told you that she was... In Paris. It was Paris, Texas, a women's facility there. Wow. So, I got in the car and I drove back here as fast as I could and I got back to the house and... Jude... had overdosed... and he... flatlined. And I thought he was gonna die that night. And he... I mean he did die for a minute. And Mom was gone. And I didn't go back to college. And I went and I... and I found Paul, so I could stick around. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that you didn't get to do what you wanted 'cause you were taking care of me.

I found out what Aunty Trashcan is called Aunty Trashcan. It's because she's been smuggling drugs from Mexico to Canada my whole life. Okay. I found out that the photo, Joan Anne record, she didn't take it. And I thought that was her thing, being a photographer, so I decided to be a photographer because of her and she didn't fucking take it. So, basically, my whole fucking life is based on a lie. Sadie, you just take a breath. Take a breath, okay? I really don't want to do this. I'm a wreck. Let's... let's talk about this. She has served as a cautionary tale. Listen, you guys need to just... this isn't for you to sift through right now. I just wanna let this all go, you know. I don't know how to let her go. I don't know how to let her just go. She seems like she's suffering. It seems like everyone is suffering and I just want it to stop. Maybe you guys just need to lie. Give her some kind of closure that you know she's looking for. I know that's exactly what she's looking for. You think I should lie to her? You lie to your mother. You tell her she was the greatest person. You were so blessed to be her daughter. And these are her last days maybe that's what she needs to hear. Okay. I'm gonna do it? I'm gonna do it. Fucking lie to her. What? Got a plan. We did all the things in the book and what we haven't tried yet is we're gonna lie to her. We're all gonna lie to her. About what? Whatever the fuck she wants to hear we're gonna tell her so she can die. Okay. - We're gonna... - You said like fighting fire with fire? My mother lied to me my entire life. I don't want to lie. Well, then why don't you just tell her the truth? Don't let your sister or anybody else take this and make it about them. This is why you're there. So far you're doing pretty good. I'm really glad you called. I am, too. I love you and I am so grateful for this time and... I forgive you. I forgive you for all of it. I remember when you slept through my wedding that time and you were like, "I don't really know about that guy Dave. He seems like a scorer." And I was like, "Wait, I love him." You know you might be right, you know. Maybe I deserve better. Maybe I should like aim higher and not like get all tied down with kids, you know, stay open, like you said. So I just want you to know that we are good. You should feel... you should feel good. Joan Anne came to me in a dream last night and she said that she was waiting for you. She was there with Jimi Hendrix and she was there with The Grate... the Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin and they are having a party, an acid party. They'd put the acid in a huge, like, forty-ounce of Jack Daniels with a little thing on the end then we could all drink it. And I don't forgive you for nothing 'cause you're perfect. I know I'm gonna miss you a lot. Why am I here, Mom? I can't believe it. I feel for this. I feel for this. I feel for this all again. I don't want to say goodbye because I don't... know who I'll... I don't know who I'll be if I don't have you around to blame for everything. We're the same. We both hate reality. So we do anything we can to try and... avoid it. Actually, I think I had a really great childhood even if you weren't in it all that much. They were all the family I needed. She's dead. Mom's dead. We should probably burn those drugs before Nurse Cool comes. We're gonna burn a bunch of weed, send of smoke signals? Or maybe we can flush the weed and then burn the drugs. Yeah. Yeah, we gotta get rid of those drugs. - Hey, hey. - What? - It's fine. - Okay. There's some more in there. Hey, pass me some more, too. - No, there's more in the bag. - Yeah. Well, that's it. That's all. No, no, no, no, no... we need to flush that. We need to flush that one down the toilet. ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello darkness ♪ ♪ Step inside ♪ ♪ Make the hours Run thru' the night ♪ ♪ Knowing that you're Far from my heart ♪ ♪ It's so hard to live on ♪ ♪ But on the day That you'll return ♪ ♪ I know you'll make My fire burn ♪ ♪ When this night is over You'll be mine ♪ ♪ Hello, hello darkness ♪ ♪ Step inside ♪ ♪ Make the hours Run thru' the night ♪ ♪ Hello, hello darkness ♪ ♪ Step inside ♪ ♪ Make the hours Run thru' the night ♪ ♪ Hello, hello darkness ♪ ♪ Step inside... ♪ Oh, that's nice.
