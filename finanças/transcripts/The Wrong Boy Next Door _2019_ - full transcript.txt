Jeez! God, Franklin, you scared me. Thought someone was back from the grave, huh? Very funny. Second one this week. Looks like you got your work cut out for you. What? Afraid you won't finish? Look, man, I didn't sign up for this. I'm done. Look at this. Throw a little $3 bag of dirt, a few flowers, and suddenly we can advertise it as a charming garden and add 10 G's to the asking price. What's not to love? You tell me. Look, when I agreed to flip these houses with you, I figured the worst thing we'd be doing is ripping off some old folks. We don't owe 'em nothing. It's not our fault that... they don't know the real values of their homes, man. So what's the problem? The problem is if they don't sell. Okay, so sometimes we need to... encourage them. There's nothing wrong with that. Yeah, well, like I said, man, I'm done. Yeah, you are. THE WRONG BOY NEXT DOOR Let's go, back to our cells. You go. It's way too nice a day to be cooped up inside. - Come on, we're gonna be late. - So what? What are they actually gonna do to us? Well, it's your funeral. Miss Foreman. Vaping on school grounds is against the rules. Oop! Katie, you're a senior. You know full well smoking is not allowed on school grounds. - I wasn't smoking. - I saw you! - She was holding it. - Katie... - I was vaping. - Katie... And necessitates a mandatory one-day suspension. Principal Perkins? Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry to interrupt. I didn't know you were busy. No, it's fine. Mrs. Foreman, this is Detective Harper. She's our liaison with the police department. - Lori? - Hi, Debbie. I'm a court reporter. We work together, sort of. As I said, I'm so sorry to interrupt, but I do need to speak to you later. - Okay. - Okay. Don't think that this suspension is the end of it. You're also grounded. - Whatever, Mom. - Don't whatever me! Do you know how inconvenient it is for me to have to leave work? And then to actually run into someone I work with? How humiliating. - I'm not embarrassed about it. - Well, you should be! Are you sure about this? My mom wants to ground me for no reason, this is what she's gonna get. It wasn't exactly for no reason, Katie. Whose side are you on? I don't know. It's the weekend. We're deserve to have a little fun. Make sure to fill that up with water and put it back before your mom gets home. I know, I know. Here. When's Aaron gonna be here? Any second. So you guys are on this week? Of course! Sam, you guys break up and make up more than any couple I've ever known. Well, without the break up, there's no make up, if you know what I mean. Samantha! Here he is. - It's what I love about you though. - Quiet. You go that way. I'll go this way. And slowly, slowly... One, two, three. God! You guys almost gave me a heart attack. I wish. Hey. Stop getting into trouble. I want my girl back. Fat chance. I'll see you tomorrow. - Thank you for picking me up. - Yeah, of course. Yes, I'll get there as soon as I can. I just... Tryin' to get a teenager out of bed is... I know. You understand. Just grab me a coffee and... I think she... Right. Okay, okay, great, yeah. I'll call you back. Finally up. Silent treatment, huh? You know, I don't know why you're mad at me. I'm not the one who needs to grow up and take some responsibility for her actions. I'm not in the mood for a lecture right now. I would've thought that you would've learned your lesson from your last suspension. You worked so hard for three years and for what? You're gonna throw it all away? Colleges are not gonna want to accept someone whose grades just plummeted off a cliff. Oh, come on, Mom, give me a break. I have given you a break. Multiple breaks. That's the problem. What do you think your father would think if he saw this right now, huh? I gotta go. I'll see you later. So you're the friendly neighborhood Peeping Tom. I've been warned about you. I'm just kidding. But you do look like her. John Link. Katie Foreman. Well, Miss Katie Foreman, how about you show me inside and show me some of that small-town hospitality? Right this way. I'll get you something to cool you off. What if I prefer something warmer? You don't miss a beat, do you? - Thanks. - Yeah. Thanks. I needed that. So what, are you the repairman or something? You're just helping the old lady out? Gladys Brill was my grandmother. Oh, God. Mrs. Brill died? Last week. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I had no idea. I mean, she kept to herself, and we never saw her. - I said hi to her. - Don't worry about it, okay? You don't need to explain. Truth is, we weren't really close to her either. My mom and her kinda had a falling out, which is why you never saw me there before. So you're just fixing up her house now? Then selling it. She left it for my mother. And then your mom gave it to you. Only to sell. Once we pay the estate tax, then I need to use the money for college. College. So do you go to college now? I graduated from St. Patrick's last May. But I took a year off. Rather than going backpacking across Europe like some kids do, I'm forced to work flipping houses. - What's your story? - Senior at Memorial. I haven't decided on college yet, so... Eighteen then. Does it matter? I don't know. You tell me. Well, Miss Katie Foreman, I better get back to work. How long are you gonna be over there? Until I'm finished. But it might be awhile. I hope so. Hey! You putting this stuff here and leaving it? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fixing up the house. Well, the trash doesn't come until Thursday. You can't leave this stuff here until then. And what business is it of yours? This is my neighborhood, and we like to keep it clean, and I don't feel like looking at your crap laying around. Well, I suggest you be on your way because when I smash your face onto the curb, it's definitely gonna leave a stain. And you wouldn't like that, would you? Katie, let's go! If you want me to drive you to school, we need to go right now. I'm gonna be late for work. - I can't find my keys. - Well, that's surprising. I don't know why you don't just walk to school. It's right down the street. Come on, come on! They'll turn up like they always do. But we need to go. Okay, guys, let's get right into it. We were talking about the Plantagenets and my favorite king, Richard the... Miss Foreman. Katie, she's talking to you. Oh. What? - The phone. - Are you serious? I put it away. Let me have the phone. You know the rules. You'll get it back at the end of the day. Let me have it. - Yeah, you want my phone? - Give me the phone. - Give me your phone. - Take it! I thought the one-day suspension would've been a wake-up call for her, Mrs. Foreman. We all did. But now this. Katie has always been a model student. In the past, yes. But there's been a change, and I don't think anyone of us can deny that. Even before the suspension, there was the cheating incident. To be honest with you, this is strike three. What does that mean? We feel one month of residential incarceration is more than fair enough, considering the circumstances. Residential incarceration? Come on, Lori. You know what I mean. It's just a nicer way of saying "house arrest." For one month, Katie cannot leave the property. Then after this period, assuming that she doesn't get into any more trouble, it'll be expunged from her record. And of course, she'll have to keep up with her studies. We'll set up an online portal for her, and we'll have a tutor come by once a week. I could take this to court. There's plenty of lawyers that would be happy to do me a favor. Mrs. Foreman... - Debbie, you know this. - Work with us, Lori. We have photos of the teacher's injury. It looks like he took a fastball to the face. If this goes to court, and if Katie's convicted, it's not house arrest we're talking about. It's jail. I'm on your side. And you have my word. This is the best deal you're gonna get. I hope you're gonna finally take this all seriously. I'm gonna be fitted with a leg iron. How much more seriously can I take it? Don't be melodramatic. It's probably no different than that FitBit you used to wear. My FitBit counted my steps. It didn't call the police whenever I leave my room. It's only for a month, and it's for your own good. Here she is. I made it a little snug. It's actually more comfortable that way. If it's too loose, it starts rubbing against the skin and can cause chaffing, so you should be fine. If it ever starts bothering you, just give me a call. I'll come on out and adjust it. Okay, thank you. You know, Katie, you're not going to be so lucky if this happens again. Okay, the LED light should remain green as long as you're within the boundaries of your property. If you leave, the LED light will begin to flash red. You'll then have 60 seconds to return. If you don't return within 60 seconds, a signal will be sent to the police station. If you try to remove the monitor, we will be contacted. If you try to disable the monitor, we will be contacted. - If you try to destroy... - I get it. - You'll be contacted. - Exactly. Let's go outside, so I can show you all how this works. - Come on. - Come on. You two of have a nice home. I like it. Thanks. My husband. was actually pretty handy, and I've tried to keep it up. You did good, Lori. So, Katie, do you remember everything I told you? - I do. - We're about to find out. Stick your foot over the sidewalk. See that? It knows that you've breached the perimeter. You have 60 seconds to get back. All right, pull it back. That's it. - Got it? - Got it. Look, I'm a cop, not a psychologist, but I'm gonna tell you, the best way for you to get through this is to put your head down, study your butt off, and complete your online classes. Oh, you won't have to worry about that. Good. I know what you're thinking. Who's this cop with a stick up her butt that doesn't know the first thing about me. But I'm here to tell you, when I was your age, I did things that you can't even imagine. A lot worse than tagging a teacher with a cell phone. I also want you to know that there's a monitor in that ankle bracelet, so if you try to leave the house one night, going out partying and then, say, that you're in the emergency room, that's not gonna fly. You leave that house, I will find you. That's a promise. - Okay. - Now get back inside. - I want to talk to your mom. - Yes, ma'am. - You okay? - Not really. I can only imagine what you must be thinking about me. What am I thinking? How does a mother allow her daughter to become a criminal? A criminal? Lori, we might not know each other that well, but Katie's a good girl. She just made a stupid mistake. Trust me, you're gonna look back one day and laugh at this. I hope so. She has just changed so much. Look, when you've been doing this as long as I have, you know the good ones from the ones that are gonna spend their entire life in the justice system. Katie's a good girl, and I can tell that you're a good mother too. Thank you. I know it's not my business to ask, but... where's your husband? - You divorced? - No. Lymphoma. He passed last year. I'm so sorry. Call me if you need to. - I will. Thank you. - Okay. Leave it alone. You'll forget about it in no time. Easy for you to say. No, Katie, it is not easy for me to say. It's not easy for me to watch my little girl throw away everything she's worked so hard for. Why is it everyone can see that but you? You know what? This is BS, and you know it! Stop blaming everyone else for your actions, Katie. The sooner that you do that, the sooner you will get your own act together. Oh, God. Just leave me alone. - Are you okay? - What do you mean? Listen, I know it's not my business, but I saw a lot of activity going on over here. I just wanted to make sure you're okay. - So are you sick or something? - What do you mean? It's a weekday. You're meant to be in school. Oh, right. Something like that. Well, I certainly hope it's not contagious. That depends. Is trouble contagious? - New fashion accessory, huh? - Oh, yeah. Courtesy of the Lake County Police Department. Does it scare you? Nothing scares me. So are you gonna tell me what you did? Arson? Kidnapping? Murder? Let's just say I had a difference of opinion with one of the teachers. What's so funny? Nothing. It's just... It's cute. Oh, like you're so dangerous. If I told you everything that I've ever done, you wouldn't sleep too well at night. Anyway, I better get back to work. - Wait, really? - I'm sorry, I just... I'm meeting with someone about the house. Don't look so disappointed. After all, you can't leave. I know where to find you. Oh, hey, wait. When we met that first day, you said I looked likeher. Who's her? That night, I saw you looking at me out the window. You probably guessed I did. And the reason I came over was... because I thought you looked like her so much. I had to see if it was really true. Okay, again, who is her? The only woman I've never forgotten. This is so stupid. If I have to stay in this house one more day, I'm gonna go crazy. So let's have a look at how this relates to last week's lesson. We want to look at some of the patterns that have been emerging, and we're looking at different factors, such as the chemical composition, how long has the Bunsen burner has been lit. What are we learning when we're looking at this side-by-side? All right, do you have the answer? - Are you Katie Foreman? - That's me. I'm Ms. Hester, your school-appointed tutor. Let's get to work, shall we? So with geometry, it looks like your teacher wants you to finish the chapter on quadratic equations. Make sure to do the worksheets in order because, as with all math, the lessons build upon themselves. For biology, you're gonna miss a great deal of lab work, so you're gonna need to watch videos on anaerobic... Katie, are you listening to me? Huh? Yeah, yeah. Of course. You know, I guess this must be kind of like a joke to you. I've seen girls like you before, never taking anything seriously, never thinking about the consequences of their actions, but you know what's really funny? Seeing those same girls years later when all their friends have gone off to college, and they're living at home, making minimum wage at a dead-end job. Is that what you want? - Answer me. - No, that's not what I want. Good. So let me see it. Ooh, I like it. It's chic. Thanks. Prison chic. It's my new style. Plastic is the new platinum. So how was your first day as a prisoner? Boring, uneventful, stupid. - Didn't that tutor come by? - Mm-hmm. - How was she? - A total bitch. Figures. She's not the only one that came over though. Who? You know the old lady that lives across the street? Well, she died, but her grandson is working on her house now. Well, you have plenty of time to make something happen. Too late for that. Katie, you're so bad! It was nothing. He just came over, and we fooled around a little bit. So what'd I miss at school? Nothing. Lots of rumors about you though. Oh, really? Yeah, before school even started, I had heard a rumor you bit off Mr. Grimes' nose. Then I heard a group of freshmen girls talking about some senior girl who was expelled for poisoning the coffee in the teachers' lounge. Me, obviously. Hey, enjoy it while it lasts. Some kids would kill for this kind of publicity. You should make a Twitter just for the phone that took out Grimes. Everyone would follow it. So how does it work anyway? You can't leave the house? No, I can leave the house, but there's an invisible force field around the property, and if I cross it, this alerts the cops. Doesn't sound that bad. You can work on your tan. Besides, I'll come by every day. That is, if you don't already have company. Be careful though. You hear about this all the time: Innocent young girl gets taken in by her mysterious next-door neighbor. - You do? - In the movies. Oh, my God. He's here. Are you serious? Damn it! My car! He knows I'm here. What should I do, go out there? What? No way! Ignore him. He'll be gone soon enough. - Hey, what's the problem? - None of your business. Why don't you go back to wherever you came from? What if I wanna make it my business? Look, dude, I don't know who you are. Go ahead. Make a move. Be a hero. I'll slice that pretty-boy face of yours to ribbons. Hey, man, we're good. Next time I see him, I'm really gonna tell him off. Yeah. Is that your guy? That's him, all right. What do you really know about him? - The basics, I guess. - Just be careful. Okay. Drive safe. - So what did you do today? - I went skydiving. - What do you think I did? - Katie, don't talk to me like that. I'm not the enemy. I'm trying to make sure you're doing everything you need to. - So did you like the tutor? - No, I did not. You're just lucky. This whole thing could have been a whole lot worse. Real lucky, cooped up in my house for a month. Would you rather be cooped up in prison? Is that what you'd prefer? You know that old lady Mrs. Brill across the street? She died. That nice old lady? How do you know? Her grandson's over there, fixing it up, and he came over. - He came over? When? - Today, obviously. - How old is he? - A little older than me. I don't think that I like that. Some boy you just meet comes over when I'm not home? Oh, come on, Mom, gimme a break. No, I'm not saying that you can't talk to him, but maybe you should just talk to him outside. Mom, people can have sex outside just as easy as they can inside. Katie! - I'm kidding, I'm kidding. - Come on! To tell you the truth, I didn't even know Mrs. Brill had a family. How would you know? You never talked to her. No, I talked to her. Couple of years ago, we had that big summer storm. I went over, I helped her bring a tree branch off her stoop. She thanked me and she said that she didn't have people to help her out with that kinda thing because she never had children. He said they weren't close, so... I wonder who'll move in eventually. The absolute last thing that we need right now is for you to make friends. You're supposed to avoid suspicion. It's more suspicious when a strange guy is hanging around their neighborhood. You're not hanging around! You're fixing up the place, and we're flipping it. Same thing we've done every other time. I really hope I don't need to start looking for a new partner. C'mon in. How 'bout we go upstairs? You got a problem with the couch? I think this is going a little fast. Are you serious? What is it? My mom wasn't happy that you were here the other day. Yeah, I know. What do you mean, you know? It's just common sense. She also said that she didn't think your grandma had any kids. What? I-I told you. My family wasn't close to her. She probably just didn't wanna talk about it. Hey, uh, can I use your bathroom? - Yeah, it's right down the hall. - All right. CALL ME BACK! WHERE ARE U? What the hell are you doing? What? Nothing! Your phone kept ringing. - I just answered it. - It's none of your business! Okay, I think you better go. Okay, look, I'm sorry. I just... I didn't mean it. I just didn't mean that. I'm sorry. John, John. I was looking out my window yesterday, over towards your house, and it looked like something was going on, like there was a man there, and you guys were arguing. It was the contractor. You know, in this business, little problems pop up all the time. May have looked much worse than it was. Hey, you're still my girl, right? Yeah, I thought so. Just remember that. Hey. Sorry I missed your call. I had company. Yeah, yeah, I'll see you soon. Bye. Love ya. I spoke to Aaron. Sam, when you said you had to tell me something important, I thought you meant... It's not about Aaron. It's about your neighbor. - He ran into him. - So? He said John threatened him with a knife. And Aaron said he was dead serious. Look, Katie, you gotta stay away from this guy. You really don't know anything about him. You said you couldn't find anything about him on the Internet. - I know he went to St. Patrick's. - So he says. Will you do something for me? Oh, no. I do not like that look. - You're up early. - What do you mean? Well, since you've been home, you're usually sleeping when I leave for work. Yeah, well, I have a lot to do today. - Schoolwork? - Yeah, something like that. Oh, good. I'm glad to see you're taking this a little more seriously. Maybe this was the wakeup call you needed. Listen, I have a late meeting, so I don't know what time I'll be home. You might wanna order in. Yeah, yeah, I just need some money. Okay. Oh, shoot, I don't have any cash. Here, take the card. Have a good day. Bye. Heavy-Duty Binoculars 5.7 centimeters. Perfect. Our guidance counselor, has left for the day, but I can tell you exactly what she would've told you. We can't, under any circumstances, simply give out information about another student. Privacy laws are very strict and for good reason. This is very serious. I'm just asking if he went here. I'm sorry. - He went here. - Chloe, don't. I'm sorry? I heard you asking about John Link. - He went here. - You know him? My older sister did. He dated her friend. Here, wait. - Is that him? - Yeah, that's him. He's sort of dating my best friend. If I were you, I would tell her to be very careful. Why? What's wrong? After Bree, my older sister's friend, broke up with him, he became very possessive, dangerous. Her family ended up getting a restraining order against him, and then he left school. This Bree, is she in here? - Oh, my God. - What is it? Can I keep this yearbook? I didn't hear a thing. In fact, I was never here. - She's a spitting image. - I'm prettier. Come on, Katie, this is serious. - That girl said he's dangerous. - I know, I know. I know this has been fun for a while, and I know you're bored, but this is serious. You need to be careful. Hey, I saw the postman drop it off. If you were waiting for it, I figured you'd wanna know. Yeah, thanks, but it's probably for my mom. She gets stuff for work delivered all the time. So can I come in? I have a lot of homework to do. And if I don't get it done, I'll never get this thing off. Okay. We're still good though, right? Katie, I said I'm sorry. I know. I just really have to go. Have you done any studying since we last saw each other? - Of course. - Then I don't understand how you don't understand these proofs. - Math isn't my strongest subject. - Clearly. You know I have to fill out reports after every session. They need to see some progress. I like to give my students the benefit of the doubt, but the one thing I expect in return is some effort. Oh, come on. Okay. Okay. So I didn't know you had a green thumb. I said, didn't know you had a green thumb. Detective Harper, what are you doing here? Oh! Oh, my God. I must've spent too long over the line while I was working. I'm so sorry. - So what are you doing? - I'm just gardening. My mom asked me to do some chores around the house since I'm gonna be here so much. Your mom had the right idea. Tell me, what are you planting? Uh, I'm not. I'm just getting the soil ready. She wanted to plant some basil. She makes the best pesto. I'm not thrilled about the false alarm, but I was thinking about coming by and checking on you anyway. You know, just to see how things are going. Let's go inside. I wanna talk to you. Okay. Okay, no BS. Woman to woman. How's it going? It sucks. Good. You get points for honesty. - And what about your mother? - What about her? How is she handling this? - My mother? - Yes. She's not the one that has to be stuck in the house all day. Could you do me a favor? Give her a break. This isn't easy on her either. I know. Look, despite everything that's been going on, we both know that you're a good girl. You know what to do, so could you please just stop screwing up? - Okay. - Good. I have said my piece. Hang in there, kiddo. - Have you been avoiding me? - John, I, uh... I think it's better if we don't see each other anymore. What are you talking about? After what we have? After what we have? John, we never had anything. We fooled around a few times. That's it. - Is it your mother? - My mother? Yeah, she told you to end it with us. My mother has nothing to do with this. Is it that bitch tutor? I took care of her for you. - What do you mean? - You can't end this, Katie. No. You're way too special to me. - I won't let you. - You won't let me? John, you can't even be honest with me. I've always been honest with you. What about what happened at St. Patrick's? - You wanna tell me about that? - I don't know what you mean. There you go, lying to me again. What the hell do you think you're doing, huh? - Checking up on me? - Get off me. Don't ever touch me again or talk to me. Knock, knock. - Who are you, Jimmy Stewart? - Who? Jimmy Stewart inRear Window. I don't know who that is. Well, what're you doing with those anyway? I'm just looking at the stars. Shouldn't you be using a telescope for that? What's up, Mom? Nothing. I was just gonna go to bed early. - I wanted to say good night. - Good night. Night. Come on in. John, Ms. Elster is here to see the house, remember? Yeah, of course. Come in, come in. I've been working on it all night. I thought we were gonna be ready to show Ms. Elster. She's... I said I was working on it! I can come back when you guys are closer. This obviously was a really bad time. - I'm so sorry. - No, it's okay. It's all right. I'll give you a call. We'll set up something. Yeah, don't bother. It's fine. What the hell have you been doing? She told me that she doesn't wanna see me anymore. - Who? - Katie. That girl from across the street? You listen to me. You listen to me! We have got a good thing going here. A very good thing! We're making a nice profit, flipping these houses. Don't you dare screw that up! And what if I don't want to anymore? Oh, okay. Oh, well, then I suspect that the authorities might get a call, suggesting they look into the deaths of a few homeowners that weren't quite ready to sell. That's right, my friend. You are in this a lot deeper than I am, so you get yourself together! I must be out of my mind to even consider this. - Why? - Why? Because it's insane! That's why. Sam, something is going on over there, okay? Something that's not right. Then why don't we just go to the police? The police? Are you serious? They're never gonna believe me, a girl under house arrest with no evidence. We need proof. We need... Oh, there he is. Okay, let's go. - We'll be FaceTiming the whole time. - The whole time. And you'll be right here watching and waiting for me? Yeah, I'll be right here. I can't see outside with the glare. And what if he comes back? He just left. He's never back that soon anyway, and we just need a few minutes over there. And remind me what I'm doing. Okay, you need to find something, anything, that tells us what he's really doing over there. Okay, okay, let's get this going. FaceTime me. See? You're gonna be great. - Hey, what's the door code? - Oh, right. 5-6-9. Yeah, okay. Just have a quick look around. It's not that big. Where are you? The kitchen. - And? - And your boyfriend sure doesn't know how to clean up. What do you mean? I mean, he's obviously been working in here, redoing it. The new counter's halfway in, the old one's all over the floor, takeout containers everywhere. Okay, okay, keep going. Okay. I'm going into a bedroom. Be careful. I think this is a guest room. There's not a lot in here besides a huge TV, a sofa, some weights. - Oh, God. - What is it? It smells like old people. Bathroom. I think this is the old woman's room. This is like a museum. An old, creepy museum. Okay, just get outta there. - Is that it, the whole area? - There's one more door. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Sam. Sam, you need to get out of there now. John's home. I repeat, John is home. Sam? Sam? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Sam, listen to me. John is home. You have to get out of there. I can't get out. I already hear the door. Well, then you need to hide, Sam, hide! What are you doing? Yes? - John Link? - Yes. Mr. Link, I'm Detective Harper. We received a complaint. A complaint? Mm-hmm. One of your neighbors heard screaming coming from your house. Said it sounded like a fight, as if someone might be hurt. Well, there's no one here but me. Oh, you know what? Maybe I was listening to the TV just a little too loud. Mind if I come in and take a look around? I don't see why you'd need to. Despite what you say, there was a complaint, and it would make me feel better. - Do you have a warrant? - Do I need to get one? Because that would be a big hassle. Put me in a bad mood. And once I got in, I'd make sure to take a really good look around. Please, come in. Not much to see, I'm afraid. Your house? No, I work for the guy who bought it. I'm fixing it up for him to sell. Uh-huh. What's his name? Why would you need to know his name? Is that a problem? - Franklin Daniels. - Uh-huh. - And where's Mr. Daniels now? - I don't know. He's the one who buys the houses. I do the renovations. Looks like you still have a lot of work to do. Well, the whole house just needed a little touchup. The kitchen was a total renovation. New floors, new countertops, new cabinets. I was thinking about redoing my kitchen. - Maybe you'll give me a quote. - I'd be happy to. - What's in there? - Bedroom. - Mind if I look in? - What for? I asked. Do you mind if I look in? - Be my guest. - Thank you. Mannequin. A mannequin. A damn mannequin. It wasn't a mannequin. I know what I saw. It was a mannequin and a lot of dolls. It seems like Mr. Link's grandmother was a seamstress. That's not even his real grandmother. Miss Walsh, you can leave for now. I have your number if I need to talk to you. I'm sorry. Bye. Thank you. You promised, Katie, and you promised your mother too. - I didn't do anything. - Listen to me. If John Link knew that you and Samantha were in his house, the two of you would be in a lot of trouble. And I'm taking a huge risk keeping this between the two of us. You do realize that, don't you? John knew we were over in his house. He didn't say anything to you because he didn't want you over there digging around. I did look around, and I found nothing. Well, what about my tutor, how John said he was gonna take care of her? Have you even tried to check up on her? I took what you said very seriously. You seem like a young woman with her head on straight. And it's plausible. Unlikely, but plausible. The fact that this young man seemed obsessed with you, and I'll admit he did seem a little squirrely. But a body? Come on, Katie. I don't care what you think. I don't care because I know what Sam saw, and I know how crazy John can be. I realize that we've said this before, but you're very lucky. It seems like you're doing everything you can to press your luck. It's gonna take someone getting killed for you to do anything! - Katie! - Sweetheart! I don't know how else to get through to her. Debbie, we both know that Katie has had a lot of issues, but she's not the kinda girl that just would outright lie like that, make things up. Is there any chance there's truth to what she's saying? I'll do what I can. I'll look into this a little further. But you have got to convince her to stop it. It's not helping anybody, and it's only hurting herself. I know, I know, thank you. I don't know what else to do, Katie, prison is the next step. Well, anything, anything would be better than this. Just tell me why do you keep manufacturing these problems? Manufacturing? Like our neighbor might actually be a killer? Cheating, the suspensions, and then finally the assault. Tell me what you want me to do, Katie. What do you want me to do because I am at my wit's end! You could try believing me! Yeah, well, you don't make that that easy. Dad would have. Yeah, well, Dad isn't here anymore. Hey, hey, look at me. Look at me. I need you to look at me. Listen, if you and me are gonna get through this, we are going to do it together, do you understand? Now, I might get mad at you, I might not like some of your actions... But I will always, always be there for you. Hear me? Do you hear me? I need you to hear me. - I'm sorry. - Oh, honey, no. I'm sorry. Mom? - Mom? - Hello, Katie. What, you're not happy to hear from me? Why do you have my mom's phone? Back to school night. Isn't that wonderful? Is there anything you wanna say to your daughter? Katie, call the police now! I don't think that would be a very good idea, Katie. What do you want? What do you want? I'll do anything. Memorial High School, 10 minutes. I think it's time we have a parent-teacher conference. So the I before the E, except after C. Oh, we have company. - John, let her go. - Katie, run! I told you, not a sound. - John... - Ask your daughter how serious I am. Ask her tutor. Ask my business partner. John, John, why are you doing this? Why? Come on, Katie, you know why. I did it all for you. Your tutor? She hated you. You knew that. She was never gonna let you pass. Well, I... I took care of her for you. And my business partner, Mr. Franklin Daniels, he viewed you as a problem, a fly in the ointment. So I got rid of him for us. You're never gonna get away with this. You're a criminal, John. A criminal? And you're so innocent. Let me see. The courtyard, where you got caught vaping. And let's see. Yes! This is the classroom, you threw your own phone at the teacher. But the best one? Today. You had your best friend break into my house! - My grandma's home! - She wasn't your grandmother! She's not being very nice. John, John, relax, just relax. I understand, I do. I understand. But not here, not here. We have to go back to where you first saw me. You remember that day, don't you? I know you saw me too. Follow me, John. - Katie, no. - Follow me. Katie... Don't go anywhere. Katie! Why you playing hard to get? I wouldn't push your luck, Katie. Or you could run, and I can go back to my parent-teacher conference. You're psychotic. Can't you see? We're meant to be together. I love you, Katie Foreman. You're my soul mate. - You called the cops? - Nope. Didn't have to. This isn't the end for us, Katie. Not a chance. Mark my words. You will be mine. I'll see you around. Mom? Mom! Mom, Mom. - It's okay, baby. - Mom, I'm so sorry. It's okay, honey, I'm all right. I'm all right, sweetheart. I'm all right. Katie. Oh, my God. You didn't have to come. Of course I did. You're my best friend. Besides, Aaron was really annoying me today. Ladies. - Did you find him? - Not yet, but don't worry. Every precinct in the city has his photo. He will not be bothering you. Okay, thank you. But I have to ask. Why didn't you call the cops immediately? I thought that if the cops showed up before I did that John would hurt my mom. I'm so sorry, Mom. It's all my fault. That's okay, Don't say that. It's true. I've been blaming everyone this entire time, and it's been me doing all of this all along. I'm the one that got suspended and hurt Ms. Grimes. I'm the one that got put on house arrest, and I'm the one that fell for John. He had us all fooled, including me. You're very brave, Katie. I was right about you. Thanks. Okay, ladies, I have to ask. What's next? A lot of studying? I think after this, I wanna go back to being a good girl. Okay. I'm proud of you. - That boy was a monster. - He was terrible. He was a sick, twisted human being. Katie, he was the wrong boy next door.
