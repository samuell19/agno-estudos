- What was that? - Don't know. Someone crying. Stupid cat. What are you waiting for? Come upstairs. It's been five years since we were married. What a terrible mistake. Greta, come on. My uncle Dan is dying at last. The telephone station's notice was from Judith. We must go to Mallinger at once. I know you're shocked but get some clothes for our suitcase. - Is there money left from the pawn? - Not much. I paid some rent that was overdue. Now we'll be able to pay and get out of this hole. Is there enough left for the train tickets and some sandwiches? We arrive at 5. Either the tickets or the sandwiches. Anyway, we won't starve. Hurry up. The death of my repulsive uncle won't solve a thing. Daniel will spend his inheritance Dr.inking and fooling around with women. It's Pablo. He must be going to Mallinger too. Thank God. You were sleeping. - How long are we stopping here? - We're waiting for the express train. We must let it overtake us. We're travelling in a blasted mail train. - Where are you going? - To the rest room. - Are you on this train? - With Daniel? Yes, but he hasn't seen you. He was sleeping. All the better. Coffee? - Double with milk, please. - Are you hungry? - Would you like a sandwich? - No, there's no time, Pablo. If Daniel should find out that I'm with you... I'll whip his hide. You're cold and frightened. You shouldn't have come. I feel sick just thinking of you within the castle walls. Don't worry. I assume you're travelling there for the same reasons. Yes. Judith called this morning from town. There's no telephone in that house. Uncle Dan is dying. He wants to see me. That repulsive animal. I must go before Daniel wakes up. Wait. Our train won't leave after the express. We've got time. No, I'm afraid that he might see us together. You know how I love you, Greta. If you tell me so, I can... Please, don't. Goodbye. Where were you? You left the train, didn't you? I went to the station's rest room. You went to the bar and you bought coffee. Did you have money for it? And you know I'm hungry. Stop it. How are we going to get to the castle? We don't have money, so we'll have to walk. You were on our train? Yes, of course. How did you intend to get to the house? I'm hiring a taxi. I can take you there, if that's alright with you. You can't fool me, Pablo. You're taking us there because Greta is here. But I have no other choice than to accept your offer. But you know I hate your company. Let's forget about that now. I'll find the taxi. Take these sandwiches. They were for me but I'm not hungry. He enjoys humiliating me, but things will change soon. I'll take that. You had your coffee. If Uncle Dan wouldn't have been so despicable to deceive my father when he kept control of the administration and the rent, our life wouldn't have been so miserable. - You don't believe me, do you? - You've been saying that for five years. You could have had a job instead of spending your money on alcohol. - Pablo had no problems. He has a job. - He's a university professor. You like Pablo, don't you? I know. You'd have been happier with him. Perhaps. But I won't forget as you do, that we were able to bury our son thanks to his generosity. He did that to humiliate me. We're almost there. Bring out the luggage, please. My God, it's a hearse. I think we're late. All the better. No need to pretend. There's Judith waiting for us. Uncle Dan's little secretary cousin. I'm sure she'll have had a good slice of the inheritance. - Dear cousin... - Welcome. Crows gather over the grave, don't they? - When did he die? - He's not dead yet. - And what's the hearse doing here? - One of his eccentricities. Let's go in. You can spare us the reception. This is no reception. I was going to Rebecca's house. She must come to Daniel's bedroom with us. Come with me. Follow me. Leave them in the house, please. Is Madam Rebecca here? - She's sleeping and doesn't want to be disturbed. Get out. How are you? Not feeling well? Yes, My legs hurt so much. I can't move them. - Did you call a doctor? - Yes, Dr. Gunter. It's nervous paralysis. Ona is taking care of her all the time. We must take you to the house. Daniel is very ill. He wants to speak to all of us in his room. Pablo and Daniel will carry you. I can't move. Please don't touch me. The pain would be excruciating. Tell my husband that I'm sorry, that I'll pray for him, but... Don't touch me. No. Don't you touch me. I'm begging you, please. You can pray all you want, but uncle Daniel will go straight to hell. Calm yourself, don't worry. We'll leave you here. I'll come in later. Did you wipe your feet properly? You didn't bring in any lizard, did you? I'd die if I'd see one here. There's no lizard. We were careful about it. Let's see what Daniel has to say. I'll see you later. Are we going to see Uncle Dan? No, I must advise Sarah and Teodora first. - Daniel wants us all to be together. - Can we eat first? You'll eat as soon as you see your mother and her mad maid. What's this, mother? Come on, turn the lights on, Teodora. It's not funeral time yet. You may be unbelievers, but at least let there be one room in the house where religious duties are complied with. Today's All Souls' Day. We must pray for our dead. These small lamps shine for your father and my mother's soul. Do they, Teodora? You can laugh, but your punishment will arrive. Today's Daniel's. Who knows whose turn it will be tomorrow. Greetings, mother. I'll see you later. I suppose it would be useless for me to beg you to keep her quiet. How can Uncle Dan stand that idiotic maid? I'll remove her as soon as he dies. Remember that Daniel will call a meeting. Be ready. - More wine? - No, pour some for Daniel instead. Now that we've had our meal, won't you explain the mystery, Judith? There's not much to say. You grandfather died from liver cancer, didn't he? And so did your father. So Daniel... - How does he know he's dying tonight? - I don't know. - Is there a will? - Is that all you care about? And you? Don't pretend to feel sorry for the death of that thief. About time he bought the farm and went to hell. Has any doctor other than that old Gunter seen him? He went to Paris and London. He visited countless specialists. These last few days, he just kept on saying that his end is near. This morning he made me call the undertaker and all of you. The undertaker? What did he bring? Black cloth, torches, votive candles... and a large coffin. Is he out of his mind? Come on, Daniel. Stop playing the fool. Uncle Dan has liver cancer. He's been aware of this for months now. He's in terrible pain. He sees death approaching. And you still wonder whether he's out of his mind? And that stuff they brought in. Where is it? - In his bedroom upstairs. - In his bedroom? The undertaker's employees have stayed here following his orders. They're in the kitchen. I can't believe he wants to have all those things around him. He's completely out of his mind. It's him. Uncle Dan is calling us. You go. I'll call Teodora and Sara. Move. Excuse me. Open up, Uncle Dan. Open the door. It's Daniel. Uncle. - Open up or I'll break the door down. - You'd better think twice, you fool. Dare to do so and you will regret it for the rest of your miserable life. Dan, it's me, Judith. We're all here. Count to ten and come in. Come in... and sit down. My God, why have you done this? Heaven will punish this horrible taunt. Shut up and sit down. This is no taunt. These documents are a life insurance I took out a year ago for 75,000 lira. It's all I can bequeath to you. In a separate will, I designate Rebecca, Judith, Daniel, Pablo, Sara and Teodora as heirs. 12,500 lira for each. Confirmed in these papers. As you can see, they're the policies, receipts and copies of my will. I've wanted to leave you something of mine. You don't own anything. You used our money to pay your insurance, but never mind. You're wrong, Daniel. There's nothing left, nothing at all. The estate, the securities, the bonds, the cattle... Everything's mortgaged. Sold. I spent it all myself. What were you after? The riches that my brother left? You don't deserve them. None of you. Neither you, Daniel, you depraved specimen. Nor you, Pablo, the master of nonsense. Nor you, Judith, you filthy viper. Nor you, Sara. Your only merit is to have given birth to a couple of worthless children. Always libelling me behind my back. No, you don't deserve them. Nor you, Teodora. You hypocrite. You didn't hesitate to sacrifice your chastity to force me into marriage with the presence of our daughter Ona. - That's not true. Isn't it true that Ona is my daughter? Yes, it is. But those were never my intentions. - Heaven will do justice to me. - This is horrible. If my husband should have known that his brother Daniel was going to rob and insult us like this... I made a mistake when I endorsed his will. Enough. There's nothing you can do against me now. I'll be dead very soon. Here's my deathbed. And I don't want your hands to touch my body. Stay where you are. I would like to take someone else to hell with me. There's a clause in my will which states that anyone who touches my body, my clothes, even my coffin, will lose his part of the insurance. Only Judith can do that. Come on, read the will. Stay where you are. It's all true. This is ridiculous. I forgot about you, Greta. You, little idiot, will inherit my sculptural work and everything inside my studio. You're the only one with an artistic sense. Maybe in a few years' time they'll pay millions for all of the objects in my collection. Get out. Take the papers and go away. Let's go. We'd better leave him alone now. Fight and argue far away from here. I require sleep. I may never wake up again. Get out now. I think we should call the doctor. What for? - There's no cure for Uncle Dan. - We'd better do it for several reasons. For the life insurance company, and for his insanity to be certified. This may help us keep something if some of his deeds end up declared void. You may not be that stupid after all. That's a good idea. And who knows if he really has cancer anyway? It would useless to bring Dr. Gunter for this. He diagnosed it long ago. But if you still doubt it, just have a look. Certificates from different doctors from Paris, London... We'll call Dr. Gunter anyway. Pablo's idea is a good one. I'll go get him. Wouldn't it be better for your brother to go instead, my son? Do you think I'm drunk? You may be right. Pablo looks a like fraudster. Let him go instead. Very well. - I'll go. - Pablo. Take our van. Doctor lives in Bahn now. - We could call the priest too. - Excellent idea. I'll bring Father Miller myself. I don't need any car. This way we'll have another witness of the insanity and common death of uncle. I'll go out and get some air. I need to clear my mind. Come with me to kitchen, Greta. The undertaker's employees must be hungry. I'll see Rebecca. I'll be right back. I'm going back to my room. I need to finish my prayers. - Did you hear that? - Yes, like a gunshot. It seemed to come from Dan's room. - Who fired that shot? - We don't know. - I think it was in Dan's bedroom. - Let's go upstairs. Where are you going? - Did you hear that shot? - Yes, it came from Dan's room. Mother. There's a knife sticking out of his chest. And his right arm is outside holding his gun. Don't touch anything. Remember the clause of his will. I'll take care of this. He didn't forbid me to touch him. Be careful. This doesn't look like suicide. - It can be murder. - And what can we do now? Think it over before making any decision. Suicide or violent death will render the insurance policy void. - They won't pay us anything. - That's true. Bloody thief. This is what this repulsive swine really intended. Let's all keep calm and avoid hysteria now. We must think what's best for us to do now. Take it easy, little girl. Don't be afraid. Uncle Dan committed suicide. He lost his mind. - Leave me alone. Don't touch me. - Stop it, Daniel. He lost his mind, you know. And he called us to commit suicide in front of all of us. - Where's my mother? - She went to look for Father Miller. It's the only thing we can do for poor Mr. Daniel. You'd better sit down. Now we have a moral dilemma. You must help us, Ona. If they know it's suicide, they won't want him buried in any sacred cemetery. - We must keep this for ourselves. - I won't tell anyone. - Not even your mistress Rebecca. - Not her, she'd suffer so much. Go to her and make sure she's alright. Tell her that nothing really happened. It was a hunting cartridge inside the kitchen's coal. I'll do so. - What is it? - It's just... I'm afraid to cross the garden by myself. I'll go with her. It's only until the door of the other house, that's all. Very well. You've been great selling the suicide version to Ona. Keep your hands off me, you scoundrel. - I'm sick of you. - Yes, you are. Suicide means no insurance. And if... Come on, spit it out. We could remove anything that may lead to think about murder or suicide. So when Father Miller arrives, we'll make him believe he died from cancer. Not bad. Let's do it. Wait for me. Please help my mother go upstairs. Listen, if we all touch the body, there won't be any reason to accuse each other. No, you do it by yourself. You're capable of suing us to keep it all for you. Alright, I don't mind. I don't need your help. I need a handkerchief. Here's mine. I'll leave the handgun in his chest of drawers. He used to keep it there. It's one of the daggers which Daniel had in his studio. The wound is almost imperceptible. Nobody will notice if I cover it with the lapel of his suit. We must make it disappear. Here, bury it somewhere. Far away. This is horrible. We should get out of here. I'm not completely satisfied with this farce. We should call the police. No. You want to blame me now? Let's get out of here. One of you should go get Dr. Gunter. We must tell him that Daniel lost his mind and got inside the coffin and he suddenly passed away. I'll go as soon as I meet Father Miller. I need to bury this away. Come in, please. - Where's the sick person? - He died a while ago. His insanity... Yes, Teodora told me about his disorders. You're all his nephews and nieces, aren't you? My deepest condolences to you all. I'm relatively new in this parish. I never met the deceased before. He was not a very religious man and his recent mental condition... Yes, but the Lord is merciful. If you don't mind, I need to assist the deceased. I know about the coffin. Teodora told me all about it. I'll take you upstairs to see him, Father. - I want to see him too. - No, Teodora, Daniel has something very important to tell you. Come with me, please. What happened? I knew that God would punish him. You can't offend the Lord so much. He has died without confession. - My God. - It's alright. My mother will explain. I'm going with them. I don't trust Judith. She's up to something. Hold on... - I think she's doing the right thing. - I'm telling you, I don't trust her. Why don't you get the doctor... Go with Greta if you wish. You'll both explain to Dr. Gunter whatever is best. I'll see what Judith is doing. Alright, come with me then. Your husband's orders. You see, it all has been so unexpected and surprising, so terrible. You were right, Teodora. The punishment has begun. Divine fury is upon us. Yes, but how did he die? What happened? I'll tell you everything. Hold on. I'll get my coat. I'm cold. Excuse me, sir. Did anything bad happen? We heard some screaming and something like a shot. Mr. Gaillim has died. The noise was a heavy piece of furniture that fell down. - Can we be of any service? - No, thank you. We'll call you later. - The priest just arrived. - As you wish. - My condolences. - Thank you very much. - When did he die? - Barely an hour ago, Doctor. Why didn't you call me sooner? I could have spared him his final agonies with pain-killers. He had some. We suggested he'd take them, but he would get angry at us. It seemed as if he was mad. Completely mad. I know that very well. Let's go and see him. I could issue the death certificate right now. It's a clear case of liver carcinoma. But I'm a meticulous man, and I must comply with this formality. We'll go and see him. Dr. Gunter, please excuse us for getting you out of home on such a bad night. Fancy a nightcap? My condolences, Madame. - Miss.... - Good evening, Doctor. Some cognac? It'll warm you up. I don't Drink. So where's the body of the master? In his room upstairs. I'll take you there, Dr. Gunter. So will I. Right, Judith? Have no fear. Judith will keep an eye on me to see that I comply with the rules. What happened during our absence? Daniel looks very strange. Nothing. Father Miller left a while ago. We don't know what happened up there between your brother and Judith, but she came down furious and Daniel was very happy. I'm afraid of your brother. He may not be completely sane. He even stopped Drinking. He spent all this time holding a cup, but he didn't drink a drop. He's up to something. Something diabolic, no doubt about it. Something that even makes Judith afraid. But I'll find out. - We should have called the police. - I think so too. Let's call the police. We're committing a very grievous sin. Teodora is right. That's what I thought as well. But it's rather late now. Any negligence or collusion is punished too. But we all need that money. We do. Just what I assumed. Inflammation of the liver is enormous. You can notice it even over his clothes. A clear, hopeless case. I'll sign the certificate. He died from cancer, didn't he, Doctor? Certainly, Madam. That was his ailment for very long. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm in a hurry. My condolences again. - I'll see you to the door, Doctor. Here's your briefcase. I told the undertaker's driver to take the doctor home in our van. Let's lock the coffin. It's better to do it now. - Is it, Judith? - Yes. The sooner the better. We'll go. The other employees are going up by the other stairs. Now my duty is to verify that the body is inside. I understand. You have duties to fulfil. Here's the key. I think Rebecca just screamed. Teodora, please go downstairs to see what's the matter. Let's get out of here. Dr. Gunter insisted that my uncle should be buried quickly. Would tomorrow at 11 be acceptable? Should we get the certificate from the doctor? - No, he already issued it. Here it is. Will you take care of the paperwork? - That's correct. - So please take care of everything. - You can go now. - Have a good night. Your whiskey. How was your little walk? You finally kissed? Watch your mouth. Stop it, for heaven's sake. It's alright. - But you know, I couldn't care less. - You're worthless. We'd better have dinner in the kitchen. Why did she scream? She says he saw Daniel Gaillim in the garden. - What? - In the garden? Rebecca has a reputation of seeing ghosts everywhere. You shouldn't worry too much about it. I think she actually saw something. The terror in her face is real. - And it's All Soul's Day. - Nonsense. I'll go out myself to see if I can greet a ghost. Teodora... Please go upstairs with my wife to arrange our bedroom. Everything's ready. You only need to make the bed. Then go and make it. Don't be sad. It's not your fault that brothers fight amongst themselves. Daniel is as bad as his father was. As his uncle Dan was. Pablo is more like his mother. He's a kind-hearted man. - Your inheritance is strange. - strange? Yes. There's nothing but rubbish and suits of armour in the studio. And the sculptures. That has very little value. Should we go downstairs for dinner? I'll be down shortly. Alright, but don't torment yourself with Daniel. He's not worth it. I'd better have a look around the studio, and see what's in there. What he left as bequest only for me. I may find something there... Help. Greta. What happened to you? Come on, talk to us. What happened? A dead body. There, in Dan's studio. - What? - In his studio? Yes. A dead man. - I think it's uncle Dan. - Where? - In a trunk. - Let's see. - Which one? - The first one. - But it's closed now. - What? Which one? This one. It's empty. But I... It was there, I saw him. Are you sure it was this one? - Yes. - Perhaps it was this other one. There's nothing but rubbish here. - It's Rebecca again. - Stupid insane women. There goes another lunatic who keeps seeing visions. Let's get out of here. This house is cursed. We all are. Too many sins. Shut up, you witch. And you, stupid woman. What were you doing in the studio? So you went down there to admire the masterpieces uncle Dan left you? I see now. You thought there was some hidden treasure there. Stop tormenting her. Did you hear that? No, Pablo. I'm sure she was down there to see if there was something of value to keep it for herself, hide it, and get away from me. You're a wicked man. And Teodora's right. - We're all cursed. - You can go to sleep, Greta. I'll join you as soon as I have a few words with Judith. I have some important business to discuss with her, that may be of interest to all. Am I right, Judith? We don't really need to have a wake for the deceased. Since the coffin is locked, it's as if he was in his grave already. Alright then. Let's go to our rooms now. I must see Rebecca first. I'll get my coat upstairs. I'll help you with this. No, you'd better go up to rest, Madam. You need it. I'll go with you, mother. So good to see you. Madam is very excited. She keeps talking about ghosts all the time. Did you tell her that her husband died? Father Miller did. He came to see her before returning to town. He expressed his condolences and I couldn't do anything about it. Was she started at all? She just said she'd soon join him. After Father Miller left she saw uncle Dan's ghost outside the window. Do you believe she really saw that? I don't know. But she doesn't talk about anything else since then. I'm very afraid. The lizards. Wipe your shoes. Don't worry, Rebecca. Keep calm, please. Lizards would be the last straw. No. Don't sit on my bed. My legs would hurt so much. If you only touch them, the pain is excruciating. Listen, Greta. You must do me a favour. - A big favour. - Of course. Dan has died. I will soon join him. Please tell him about it if you see him walking in the garden. Tell him that I pray for his soul. - Tell him. - Yes. But have you seen him? Of course I have. "Have them bury me in a grave". "A very deep one." Bury me there too. No, I don't want to be in a niche. Niches are full of lizards. There are no lizards down in the ground. - Will you do it? - I will. But you must promise me something in return. Yes. What? That you'll stop talking about spirits and ghosts. You're frightening Ona. Turn the lights off and have some sleep. You both need rest. It's very late. - Thank you. - I'll carry out your request. Good night. See you tomorrow. It's me, Pablo. - Did I frighten you? - A little. Please don't. Be honest. What happened in Daniel's studio? I saw a dead body in the trunk as clearly as I see you now. It's awful that nobody believes me. - Well, I do. - Yes, but you're the only one. I wouldn't be so sure about it. I think Daniel and Judith believe you too. So what? We'll find out. Don't worry yourself. Rest now. Go to your room. Judith's room. She must be still talking with my husband. I wonder what they are up to. I don't know. That's exactly what I want to find out. You'd better go to bed before Daniel does. I'll stay here watching for a while. It's me, Teodora. The best you can do is to lock yourself in your room, and not leave until daylight. But what's happening now? Rebecca is right. There's a spirit around. A lot of things may occur tonight. What are you doing here? Soon. I'll be rich very soon. Very rich. I will give you money. A lot of money. And you'll be able to get away from me, and leave me alone, you stupid woman. Stop creeping around. Stop spying on me. You're going to ruin it all. No. It has all been a... What is it, Greta? What happened? Talk to me. Upstairs. In my room. Daniel... They murdered him. My God. You hysteric girl. You didn't see who shot him? No, I only heard the shots. Let's go upstairs. You can tell us about it later. Come with me. But how...? He's not here. He was lying here when I ran away. Pablo, this can't be so. I think I'll lose my mind. - I can't believe this. - Calm down, Greta. You're not a frightened child. Pull yourself together. You must tell us the truth. Daniel was there, next to the door. - And I was here, lying on the floor. - On the floor? Yes, he had just knocked me down. He was coming right at me, threatening me. And suddenly, he shouted something. He held out his hands in fear. I heard the shots and he fell on the floor. How many shots? - Two. - Who'd have been able to remove his body? I rather think he must have left by himself. No. He had two wounds. He was dead. Enough. We must search the entire castle. We must find Daniel. - There's nothing in here. - Let's look under the bed. Nothing here. - Let's check your room. - Alright. Let's go. He's not here. Nothing here either. We must keep on searching. Drink this, Greta. It will do you good. I'm starting to think about the possibility that the shots, his collapse, his wounds... it all could be a wicked trick from Daniel. No, Pablo. Daniel is dead. - It was not a hallucination. - Where's the body, then? I don't know. There's no point in arguing now. We're all extremely tired. I think we should sleep. I don't want to be alone in my room. I understand. You can sleep in my mother's room. Of course, dear. Good morning, Madam. Did you have a good night's rest? Not really. As you can imagine. I've hardly slept a wink. Teodora. Did I sleep much? Indeed. It's nine in the morning. I brought you coffee lette. You must get ready. We must leave for the funeral in an hour. You must resign yourself, Madam. I'm Pablo Gaillim. To whom have I the honour? Hugo Patrick. I'm a police inspector from Mallinger. I'd like a word with you in private. Of course, please come inside. After you, sir. Well, I'm listening, Inspector. I can't quite figure out the reason for your presence here, to be honest. Someone called us early this morning to say that Daniel Gaillim went missing last night. What an odd thing to say. Daniel went to town to resolve an urgent issue. The anonymous caller said that he had been murdered. That's a poor joke. If so, then please tell me where can I locate Mr. Gaillim. We don't have his address. He would stay at an hotel. Excuse me, sir. We didn't call the police. Please respect our grief. We just buried our uncle. I regret to disturb you but I have no other choice than to question you all one by one. I'll be right back. We must save the insurance. Avoid talking about uncle Dan's death. Only Daniel's. Remember that uncle Dan died from cancer. Can you please show me a room where we can speak alone? Yes, I'll take you to the living room. Follow me, please. I'm sorry, but I have orders that you shouldn't speak among yourselves. Let me remind you that you must not speak to any of these people, thank you. The lords of the manor, please? They retreated to their respective rooms. I see. I'm going to question Mr. Daniel Gaillim's widow with this young lady. I'm very worried. Inspector Patrick is suspecting the truth. - Well, that's not my impression. - I think he suspects something too. Moreover, he thinks that Pablo killed Daniel. Don't worry, truth will always prevail. Who can it be now? It came from the main door. You should see who's there from the window. It's the police. Keep calm, please. - Is the family here? - They just had a cup of tea. There they are. I apologise for any inconvenience, but I have to ask you all to go to Daniel Gaillim's widow hall. I think Miss Judith is missing, isn't she? She went to her room. Ona, please tell Miss Judith to come down immediately. Alright, come with me and I'll inform you of everything. With such a commotion, lizards may get in the room. Do you know what's inside this box, Madam? Some lizards. Specially for you. Please stay calm, Madam. They're not true lizards, but plastic toys. As you can see. You can go back to your bed now. Please excuse my test, but it was necessary to prove that any of you, and even you, could have killed Daniel. Provided that he's dead. Do you still doubt it? I haven't seen his body, so I do. During my absence I verified that the properties were all mortgaged. And I hear that creditors will take everything away. Did you verify if the insurance is legitimate? Yes, the company will pay. But there's another important issue still pending. The will that Daniel provided to you is null and void. The notary says Daniel dictated another one later to replace the previous one. - Another one? - Favouring whom? You, to be precise. You will inherit those 75,000 lira. I promise you that I didn't know anything about it, Inspector. I promise you that the insurance will be shared as we all expected. There's honour in that decision. But for your peace of mind, I can tell you that I don't suspect you. - But you, on the other hand... - Me, Inspector? Your or Pablo. Or perhaps you're both my favoured suspects now. You love each other. You insisted on diverting my attention from Pablo when I questioned you. And he acted likewise about you. You're wrong, Inspector. Neither of us two killed Daniel. You're only suspects at the moment. I still need to check a few things. Are you going to arrest me? No. There's nothing I can do if Daniel's body is not found. It's a little loophole of the law. No dead body, no proven murder. Well, I must be going now. You're all free. I'll come back tomorrow. I wish you a good afternoon. Come on, cheer up. Everything's alright. And we're free. Inspect the door for lizards. Wait. Close the window first to keep the ghost away. The Inspector suspects that Pablo shot Daniel. Yes, that's right. But with which handgun? It could be Daniel's handgun. Judith put it inside his chest of drawers. Will it still be there? Will it have Pablo's fingerprints? I'd better find out. Pablo, are you there? Greta, where are you? I'm here, Pablo. Hurry up. - What happened to you, my love? - Be careful. - He must be around somewhere. - Who? Who was here? Him. Daniel. He wanted to kill me. Daniel? Here? Alive? He was here. You're shivering. We'll go to your room. Don't be afraid. I'm with you now. Pablo. I think I'm going to lose my mind. This is awful. Calm yourself. Tell me what happened. Take your time. I thought about the inspector, about the shots that killed Daniel, the handgun... He may charge you with it. And I went to look for it in uncle Dan's bedroom. Do you understand? You thought that I...? No, you're wrong. Go on. What happened then? Someone came up from downstairs when I was in his room. And that someone came in. It was him, I'm telling you. It was Daniel. He tried to strangle me. Forget it. No need to be afraid. You're safe now. You'd better lie down now. Pablo, I don't know what's happening to me. You were very weak when you came. And the atmosphere in this house, the events you've witnessed, Uncle Dan's passing... That knife sticking out of his chest, Teodora's anathemas... All of this has made you become depressed. - You wanted to be brave and... - So you think it's all hallucinations. What about Daniel? Is it my imagination as well? No, but since you witnessed the murder... Should I phone Inspector Patrick? No, please don't leave me alone even though you see me asleep. You keep calm and try to sleep. I'll spend the night on the other bed. - Don't keep on saying that... - I'm telling the truth... I didn't flinch when it happened... ...you must understand that you have to go to police headquarters... Everything I've said is the truth, Inspector. - Don't say a word. - What's going on? Just pretend to be asleep. Let's see... she may confirm what you say... - I'm sorry, Mr. Pablo. - It's alright. Please, come in. I'd like to ask you a few things. Did you go to bed late last night? Not really. When you and your men left, Greta came here to sleep. She was afraid of being alone. I arrived shortly after and have been watching over her all night. And you went to bed with your shoes on, didn't you? Precisely after all that happened tonight... I don't quite follow you, Inspector. Very well. Please get Dressed and follow me. - Do you think he knows anything? - Not at the moment. See for yourselves. She was strangled a few hours ago. Do you know anything about this, Mr. Gaillim? No, I don't. Very well. We'll have plenty of time to talk later. Come with me, the three of you. Can you tell me who discovered Judith's body, Inspector? Teodora did. I arrived early with my men when she was preparing breakfast. I asked her to call everyone for me and she started with Judith. We don't have time for more. We must go to the cemetery at once. - To the cemetery? - Yes, I'll explain later. The casket is almost visible now, Inspector. - Good. - Are you exhuming my uncle's body? Yes, I have a court order. - What are you expecting to find in his body? - Perhaps nothing. But I think we'll have a surprise as soon as we open the coffin. Leave it. What's the point now? If any of you feel disturbed, you can leave. I'll require you later for identification purposes. - Do you have the keys? - No, my brother Daniel had them. Then we have no other choice than to force it open. It's ready to be opened now, Inspector. It's my brother Daniel. You searched everywhere but not inside the coffin. The murderer made the right choice. I must confess that I'm surprised as well. You weren't expecting to find Daniel there? Yes, but only him. I was wrong. There are two bodies there. The other one is Daniel Gaillim, isn't it? Yes, it is. Well, this may serve to appease Greta. One of her hallucinations has come true. Interesting. Two bodies and only a coffin. A large coffin specially ordered by Dan for two bodies to fit in. Have Daniel's body taken out of there for the autopsy. Don't touch the other one. You can bury the casket and cover the grave. Can we leave now, Inspector? The ladies are very distressed. Of course. We can go. Take this first body out. It's not Daniel. It's not Daniel's body. That man is not Daniel. Your second hallucination has come true too, madam. And why not the third one as well? What do you mean by the third one? Greta saw Daniel's ghost last night. We must inform you about some events that happened last night. Let's go to the manor. My men will take care of this. - Really? - In the studio upstairs, sir. An agent just found your uncle Dan - well, his corpse, in a trunk in his studio. His neck is broken. Please leave us alone, officer. Please sit down, Mr. Gaillim. Something you overlooked, Teodora. You forgot to polish it. But don't worry. I polished it myself. But I... Please calm down. It's all clear now. The unknown body belongs to Mike Thompson. A tramp who was living in an Almshouse. He suffered from liver cancer. A year ago, some Mr. O'Brien was looking for a cancer patient to test a new treatment. Mike went to see him. This O'Brien was Daniel Gaillim. He took Mike to London and Paris pretending he was Daniel. And doctors certified that there was no cure for his condition. These certificates served me to prove it all. So my uncle didn't suffer from cancer after all. He was fit a as a fiddle. And he set about his plan as soon as he found the right man. - His plan? - Yes. He started mortgaging the Gaillim properties. He sold the crops, and he amassed a fortune, and opened an account in Australia under an assumed name. And the insurance? It was a very important part of the plot. He would use the will to prevent you all from ruining the deception of his supposed death. - Do you understand? - Yes, but what about Judith? Dan needed an accomplice and he turned to his beloved secretary. They agreed to keep all the money for themselves. Dan brought Mike here. When Mike died, Dan and Judith prepared the scene of his fake murder. They called you and the undertaker. Mike's body was already in the trunk and that made the first stage of his scheme quite easy to carry out. - But something went wrong. - A few things did, actually. The accidental discovery of Mike's body by Greta and, most of all, Daniel's mistrust. Daniel must have noticed something suspicious about Judith's demeanour. And it's certain that he found out that the body was not his uncle despite the make-up. Now I understand his arrogant attitude and why Judith obeyed his orders blindly. That's why Dan shot Daniel when he found out that he had discovered his plan. And he took his body and hid it in the coffin to make you all believe that Greta had lost her mind. Did he kill Judith too? There's no doubt about it. Judith caught traces of Dan's skin underneath her nails when she was strangled by him. Why would he want to kill her anyway? They must have argued over something. Maybe Dan wanted to get rid of the only witness that could ruin his plans for an opulent future. So who killed Dan, then? What makes you think he was killed? I don't know. But a broken neck is a proof of violent death. If so, if you believe Dan was murdered, then the murdered must be any of you three. You'll have to prove that, Inspector. That won't be necessary. I believe that Dan died from fortuitous reasons. He panicked when he saw the game was up and he hid in the trunk. But the trunk's heavy lid fell over on his head. I examined his body carefully. - His position inside the trunk. - But sir... I hit him with the candelabra when he tried to strangle Greta. I did it to save her. I'm happy to hear your confession. That's very honest from you. I suspected that some of you must have hit him. But he didn't die from that blow. It only pushed his collar bone in. - He died inside the trunk. - Thank you, my Lord. I almost forgot... You'll be able to recover Mr. Gaillim's fortune. Your father's will remains valid. I wish you the best of luck. Teodora... Thank you for saving Greta. Thank you so much, Teodora. My mother and Rebecca must be worried about us.
