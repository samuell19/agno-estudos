And you said, "I can't have a baby with you, "because you would make a terrible father." - What's that got to do with you killing people? - You remember that time when you made me go to that holistic sweat lodge in Orlando, and you said I have a long way to go to becoming a man? Well, that really stung by the way. - [MELANIE] So? - So? So? So I didn't want to get fired from another job and have you think I was just some loser accountant, too. (GENTLE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) - Wait. How many people have you killed? - None. You know what, there's a first time for everything. (GROANING) Ow! (WINDOW THUDS) I gotta be at the cemetery at midnight. (BELLS RING) But I've got a plan. A, I sneak out without attracting any attention. B, I take your car. C, I go to the cemetery. D, I calmly pretend to have the ransom money. E, I ice the kidnapper. (GUN FIRES) (GROANS) F, I get Fakir's body back. G, I give Mr. Gunder back his keys. - I knew I could count on you, boy. - Thank you, sir. Which I found in Fakir's pocket. - And then what? - And then, well, then I, okay, no tricky questions, please. - I wish you'd think this through. - Okay, don't worry.

I didn't take the oysters with me. - Oysters? - Where is he? - Al! - And what's with the gurney? - Oh, that's actually a custom fit ergonomic medical bed, which you won't believe, but you can have it for a fraction of its original cost, which is-- - Who's the man on it? - There's no man on it. - Yes, there is. - It's not a man. - [TCRS MAN] Who is it then? - It's, uh, he's, he's a woman. It's actually, it's a woman on the bed, the gurney, the medical bed. - [TCRS MAN] What's she doing here? - Just lying around, I guess. - Why? - I can't tell you. - Damn it, I said why! - Okay, okay, 'kay, 'kay, okay, okay, I'm just g-g-g-getting it.

(CROW CAWS) - Al, the organ player's here. - No, no, no, no, I don't do organ players any more. Secretaries and dentists neither. We talk about teacher. - No teachers tonight, tomorrow. - You've got another thing tomorrow? - It's pretty much the same thing. - But you're welcome to stay and watch, just no interruptions. - Once in my life, once, once in my life! You know, what about the Sunday vegan dinners at your parents' that you made me go to? - Oh, don't start that again. I've had it, I've totally had it! - That's it! I've had enough. - You've had enough, you know what? It's me who's had enough, okay? Do you think I'm havin' the time of my life? Do you think I even mildly enjoy pan roasted tofu in a hazelnut foam with an avocado mousse? - You have a problem with my cooking? - Do you have a problem with yourself? - I'm having a problem with you! - You have a problem with me? You have a problem with me? - Maybe I can get this part of me of party last week, but what I see here, it just sick! - There's no understanding! No empathy, no care on your part. - And you know what else in the bedroom-- - Department, a complete lack of interest! - On whose part? - I have no need to criticize myself in that area. - Ah, maybe you should ask my opinion on that one, mister! - Mister? - Yes. - Okay, listen, lady! I've been asking your opinion all my married life and three years before that, and I'm tired of it! Okay, I am gonna tell you what I think, and there is a four letter word to describe you, and, you know what, it's called cold! - Cold! - C-O-L-D, cold! - Me, cold? - Yeah, you're cold, okay, and don't act like you don't know what it means. - You're like that one popsicle that's been in the freezer for so long it just loses all its flavor. - Oh? - Maybe you need some more of that wonderful marriage counseling you love so much. - You know what, I thought that might be beneficial! You know that it might actually help us. - So we wouldn't need to spend our nights jumping from one devastated marriage to another eating caramelized Spanish flies, ginger juice, and strawberries. - And don't act like you weren't into it, you and your copious note taking. - Oh, I wasn't taking notes. I was actually thinking up new recipes. I was pretending to be interested. I agreed to do it for you, I didn't need it. - That's funny. That's so funny. - It's not funny anymore. - No, it's hilarious. - Look at me, I'm normal, healthy woman. A loving-- - And supporting wife, I don't understand how you can-- - Treat me the way you do. - I treat you with respect! - I don't want respect, Toby, I'm a woman for God sake! I want-- - Romance? - Why not, among other things. - Ah, yeah? Is that what you were cookin' up with that chap with the fake English accent and the blinding white false teeth? - How could you even tell me that at that alien invasion party, Princess Leia in bikini could tear your own murder me dress like Scarlett Johansson, huh? And this grin granny was hitting on you. - He was just a cooking class friend. - Oh, yeah, what kind of guy with any sense of manliness attends a cooking class? Okay, you know what, I saw how you were staring at him all night, laughing at his ridiculous jokes. - I was, because yours really aren't funny, Toby. - Oh, actually mine are killingly funny. I'm a funny American guy! - Okay, make me laugh. Tell me a joke for once in your life. - So, I, I, you know, don't change the subject on me! - And tonight you wanted to leave me all alone back at that accountant's and got everyone to come over here secretly. Don't deny it. Don't. I got your secret letter. Cemetery at midnight. It's all here. The party's over. Go home. How old are you, anyway? You should be cramming for exams, not looking for a bit of-- - But this is for school. The Shakespeare National Contest. - Heard about it? Starts tomorrow. - We're practicing in the cemetery to soak up the ambiance. - Shakespeare was all about blood and guts. (MASK CLATTERS) - Who the hell are you? - I'm Hecate. - I'm the witch. - I'm Macbeth. - I'm King Duncan. - Please, ma'am, don't send us home. - [KID] Yes, please. - This is really important. - Oh, please. - Please. - Come on, pretty please. - Please, please. - [ALL KIDS] Please, please. - Please don't send us home.

(DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) - Do you even remember the last time you kissed me? - Oh, it's really hard to kiss a walking set of binders, sharpened pencils, and chronologically arranged invoices all rolled into one! - That might be the cruelest thing you've ever said to me. You know, I am done with this conversation. - I'm just starting! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) - Women, okay, whoever invented women? If that's even his real name. (SOFT TALKING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Is it really that bad that I'm organized? That, you know, I like to keep my shoes in a neat little row, or that I like to color coordinate my socks? (SOFT TALKING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Or that maybe I just prefer the original number two sharpened pencils? - All right, that's enough. Where's the money? - Where's my car? - I beg your pardon? - Yeah, you stole my body and my car. Okay, the body's right here, so where's my car? - We take the car as a bonus! - What are you, nuts? I need that car. I use that car every day to go to work. You know what, if I don't get that car, in this traffic, it could be murder. - Are you attemptin' to be humorous? I thought you were a serious client. I'm cancellin' the transaction. Son, take the expired persona and go! We'll deliver the unfortunate cadaver to the proper authorities with your documents.

(DOGS BARK) (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) TCRS. - [COP] What? - TCRS? - And I'm taking back this investigation. - The dead guy. - What's the idea showin' up alive? - That's a good question. How can I show up alive when this Miraslav Gunder, nickname Gunder, sentenced me to death yesterday by ordering one of his thugs to shoot me dead. - [BOTH] Yeah, how? - Well, I guess I'm just another victim of the merciless Polish vodka trade industry. According to our statistics 96 lives were lost in the last two years. 79 of those lives at the hand of that man Gunder! - Can you prove this? - No, but I can prove something else from the very accounting records of Mr. Gunder, who specializes bringing to America the world famous Polish vodka, Sokolova. - Wait a minute. Who did you say you are? - Who did you say you are sir? - TCRS! - TCR what? - Hell if I know. - [COP] Feds, maybe? - Tax Consultancy Reconciliation Services Limited. - Ah. - Last year, Mr. Gunder purchased 22,500 bottles of Sokolova Gold premium label, of which 21,300 bottles were distributed at a price of $36. 16,154 bottles were sold. That makes a grand total of $581,544. He only paid $28,226 in excise tax, instead of the $40,708 that was required. - Which means Gunder did not pay excise tax on 4,953 bottles of Sokolova. That being said, gentlemen, I order you in the name of TCRS to arrest that man for tax fraud against the United States of America in the amount of $12,482. - [COP] Damn. - [COP] 12,000? - Not bad. - That's how they got Capone. - Wa-Wait a second. I'm sure my accountant will be able explain everything. - Me? - What did I hire you for? - Well, to be perfectly honest you actually hired me-- - Get to it! - Okay, okay. - You know I'm not good with numbers. - But I am, Gunder. I've checked it all out. You're finished. - Did you check article 43.16 of the Goods and Services Tax Act? - Excuse me? - For donations for nonprofit organizations. - Oh, that's got nothing to do with it. - Actually it does, 'cause you're claim ignores the fact that 4,953 bottles of Sokolova were donated by Mr. Gunder to several nonprofit organizations, including, uh, two police stations. - [COP] Oh, I remember that. - One US Customs Enforcement Agency, the mayor's office. - Yeah. - One Polish bathhouse, and an undisclosed clinic that Mr. Gunder was operated on for a severe case of hemorrhoids. (MUFFLED CHUCKLING) - That's irrelevant. Donations are not exempt from tax according to article five of the US taxation code. - You're right. - In the name of TCRS, I order you-- - But did you check article 10 of that same code? In the case of donations, the taxable base is actually the price of the given goods that are bought and not sold, and, therefore, since every bottle of Sokolova wholesales for $23 that would be, uh, for 4,953 bottles. You carry the one, $113,919, and of course if you add the 7% excise tax that would make it, uh, $7,974 and 33 cents. And this exact amount was paid in full April 22nd as is in line with this attached documentation. - Impossible. That's impossible! - Okay, it's, it's actually quite possible and very, very, very accountable. - I knew I could count on you, boy. - [COP] He's innocent, I guess. - Thank you, sir. - Am I free to go, officers? - Boss, I think you're free to go. Back to playing with the bodies. - Playing with the bodies? - Yeah, it's just Mr. Gunder's secret private initiative. It's purely entertainment purposes. No one gets hurt. - What's the idea now? - Sir, this is a free country. Everybody has the right to spend their nights they way they want to. - Unless other participants aren't willin' and able. - You got that right. - I don't know what, what he's talking about. - Okay, please, officers, he just tells me it's just an innocent graveyard party. - Don't listen to him. He's just stupid accountant. I'm a businessman. - No, he's not! I saw him digging up graves. - Really? - [MAN] Did he say graves? - Yeah, yeah, of course. You have to dig up the bodies before you can dress up the bodies. - Engaging corpses in night games of a highly dubious nature. - Especially in a cemetery. - Is illegal in this country. Hands behind your back. (PLAYFULLY DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) - [COP] Watch it! (YELLING) - [COP] He's got a gun - [COP] He's got a gun! - Drop the gun now! - Freeze!

(CROW CAWS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) - Let's go, keep it movin'. - Oh, yeah. - [COP] Move it. - He's dead? Like, real dead, cold-stone, seriously? - Well, I'm no expert, but he looks pretty dead to me, lady. - I did nothing. I even wired my tax deceleration. - I told you Shakespeare's bad luck. My brother flunked English when they asked him about that depressed Danish guy. - [COP] Shut up. (GENTLE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) - So his villa is mine? And the apartment in St. Bart? And the ranch in Wyoming? (CRYING) - [COP] Hey, you got a pack of smokes there, Charlie? (GENTLE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) - [MAN] Hey, wait for me! - Congratulations, never thought I'd meet an accountant with such brains. How'd you like a nice, comfy, well-paid job with TCRS? - I'm fine with that. As long as you will work as an accountant and not a hitman. (GENTLE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) - It's a promise. - All right then. Call you tomorrow. Merry Christmas. - [MAN] Cowards die many times before their death. The valiant never taste of death but once. - [MAN] Go on, shut that Shakespeare! - So, about our conversation? (SMACKING) Oh! - That's for all the lies. (GENTLE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) And that's for not dying on me. - Sorry to disturb. - Ah! I thought you were-- - Dead! - Yeah. - Yeah, I should be. Gunder shot me. - Oh. Luckily he missed. - No, he didn't. Got me straight in the kisser. Weird, isn't it? The gun had blanks in it. - Ah. - Now how could Gunder have killed Fakir with blanks? - I don't really know. (GASPS) (CROW CAWS) I really don't know about these things, 'cause I'm an accountant, you know? You know what I think is there's probably a big promotion in it for you, you know, for putting away Gunder. Oh no! (GASPS) You know what, it'd be a shame to waste it! It really would. Really would. - Just pray that the gun which really shot Fakir won't be found. Yeah? (PLAYFULLY DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GASPS) (CLANKING) (PLAYFULLY DRAMATIC MUSIC) - Shootin' angels.
