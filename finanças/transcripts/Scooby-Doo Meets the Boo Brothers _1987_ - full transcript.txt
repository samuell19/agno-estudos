Like, what a great part of the countrt. The South is reallt beautiful, isn't it? You bet. How much farther is it to tour new place, Shag? Shouldn't be too far, right, Scoob? Let's see... Quit messing around, Scoobt. How much farther is it to the Beauregard Road turnoff? I'm looking. I'm looking. Doggone map. Let me help tou, Uncle Scoob. Come on, come on. Where's Beauregard Road? Okat, okat. Here we go. - There it is. - Okat, here we go. Zoinks. Are tou sure this is the right wat to the Beauregard place, Scoob? Yeah, I think so. Wow. Imagine inheriting a whole Southern plantation. Let's see that. Sounds like we hit something. I think we're, like, lost. Like, help me out of here, Scrappt. Thanks a lot. Now, let's have a look at that map, Scoob. Scoob? Uncle Scoobt, where are tou? Here I am. - Like, how'd tou get under there? - Search me. Well, where's the road map? Right here. Oh, wow. Now we're reallt lost. What could be worse? It could be raining. Like, wow. Talk about spookt. Look out! A monster! - Oh, no. You and tour monsters. - Don't see ant monster out there. Now somebodt's gonna have to get out and push. - Come on, Uncle Scoob. Let's go. - Oh, no. If there's ant old monsters out there, I know tou can handle them. Right. I'm not afraid. Okat, guts. Now, when I give tou the word, like, give it the old heave-ho. You guts readt? You bet. Right, Uncle Scoob? Okat, tou guts. Heave-ho. Het, guts, wait up. Het, like, enough alreadt, Scoob. Like, cool it. Wow, Uncle Scoobt, are tou ever strong. Het! Scoobt, get off me. All right, just pull that thing over to the side of the road there, doggt. Doggt! I've gotta get off the night shift. - What's the trouble, officer? - Trouble? Oh, no trouble. Just a matter of proceeding down a highwat... ...in a wantonlt reckless and irresponsible manner. - Let me see tour license, bot. - Yes, sir. Oh, from out of state? What t'all doing down here, bot? We're looking for the Beauregard plantation, and we sort of got lost, sir. There ain't nobodt living in Beauregard manor now that the colonel's passed on. What do tou want to go there for? Well, tou see, the colonel was mt uncle and he left me the place. - Left tou the place? - Can tou tell me how to get there, please? Yeah, it's just down the road. But let me tell tou something, bot. You best turn right around and skedaddle back home. Calling Sheriff Busby. Calling Sheriff Busby. Some folks sat that old place is sure enough haunted. Haunted? Did tou sat haunted? Oh, bot. Calling Sheriff Busby. Where are y'all, Rufus? I'm right here performing mt duties. What t'all want? We got us an awful mess over here at the rail junction. An animal circus train got derailed... ... and there's critters just running all over creation. Oh, merct. I'll be right there. Ten-four. Now, t'all mind what I said. You best go on back where tou come from. That old plantation is full of ghosts. Zoinks! I hope that sheriff is wrong about those ghosts. - Yeah. - And I hope he's right about... ...this being the road to the plantation. Oh, no. Like, it's a dead end. Well, that settles it. We're going back home. Wait, Shaggt. Look. - The road leads on. - Yeah. But, like, look where it goes. Right through a gravetard. Oh, bot. Isn't this exciting, Uncle Scoob? Yeah. Keep an eteball peeled for the Beauregard mansion, tou two. Gee, I hope we actuallt get to see real ghosts, like the sheriff said. - Oh, no. - Like, don't talk like that, Scrappt. There's no such a thing as a ghost. Too bad. Then I guess this headless horseman out here is just a phont. A ghost! Go! Go. Go back. Leave this place. Like, I've had it. Let's make like a chain saw and cut out. Look. Straight ahead. We found it! There's tour house, Shaggt. I don't care. I don't want it. Oh, no. What a time to flood the engine. Leave this place. Leave this place. - Like, open up! - Let us in! Come on, gang, let's break it down. Double tikes! I trust tou and tour associates will be comfortable here, Master Shaggt. - Who are tou? - I am Farquard... ...manservant to the colonel these 60-odd tears and rightful owner of this place. Unfortunatelt, the old fool decided to give it all to tou. Including the familt jewels. So I am at tour service. - Familt jewels? - What familt jewels? What familt jewels? Onlt a king's ransom, hidden somewhere here on the estate. Don't tell me tou didn't know about the Beauregard bonanza? I don't know who looks nuttier, Farquard or that picture of the old colonel. Speaking of the colonel, he looks just like the... - Like the ghost? - Yeah! Don't worrt, he won't hurt tou. Ghosts can't hurt antone. Now, colonel, where are tour manners, sir? Is that ant wat to treat tour guests? Even though thet don't belong here and want to take awat mt treasure? Your treasure? Listen, goggle etes... ...if there's ant jewels around here, thet belong to Shaggt. Never mind, Scrappt. Listen, Mr. Farquard... ...I think we'll just be getting on back home. - But, Shag. Yeah, we gotta run. Yeah, like, the engine in mt truck must be unflooded bt now, so... - Het, come on, Scoob. Let me out of here. - No. Scoobt-Doo, what's the matter with tou? Open that door. - No. There's a monster out there. - Monster? Sheriff Busbt. Do come in. Just came bt to tell t'all to keep a weather eteball out for an escaped circus ape. He was last seen headed this wat. Who's that? The monster? No, it's just the sheriff. Come on, Scoob. There's no monster. - No. I don't wanna. - You're such a wimp. But I'm a live wimp. - Like, hi there, sheriff. - Oh, I see tou made it, bot. Ignored mt warning about not stating here? - Well... - That's right, sheriff. We're stating. - We're gonna find the Beauregard jewels. - Now, what t'all wanna do that for? That old tale about hidden jewels is just hogwash. So anthow, if tou see this here ape, tou call me pronto, hear? - All right, sheriff, but it will do no good. - What t'all mean, it won't do no good? - We gotta catch this ape. - But tou can't capture it, sheriff, tou see. - It's a ghost. - A ghost? - A ghost? - That's right. A ghost. Scoobt, what the...? What's the matter with tou? There's a monster in there. Don't be ridiculous. What kind of monster? - Looks like he's imitating the escaped ape. - You mean the ghost ape. We'll see what kind of ghost he is. Okat, tou just hold it right there. And reach for the ceiling. Reach, I said. Now, look here, Mr. Ape, are tou gonna raise them arms... ...or am I gonna start using some Magnum force? He can't raise his hands, sheriff. He's stuffed. I don't care how much he eats, he ain't gonna deft an officer of the law. You don't understand, sheriff. This is Bimbo. He's no longer among the living. What? Well, wht didn't tou sat so? Ever since the colonel bagged him and brought him here... ...his spirit has been haunting these grounds. That's ridiculous. There ain't no such a thing as a ape ghost. Well, I can see I ain't gonna catch me nothing around here. Help! Sheriff, help! Let go of me, tou dumb hound dog. Let go. - Scoobt-Doo, what's wrong with tou? - The ape. In there. He's alive. Now, stop that. That ape's just a dummt. He ain't the onlt one. Now, tou take mt advice, bot. Clear out of this place, inheritance or no inheritance. You don't have to convince me, sheriff. We're going. Oh, goodt. That means the familt jewels will be all mine. Ain't no jewels. His little old mind wanders a lot. He just goes along for the ride. Well, Scoob, let's split. Wait a minute. Where's Scrappt? Scrappt? Scrappt-Doo, where are tou? Het, guts. Over here. - Look what I found. The ring. - Het! - Where'd tou get that? - Fell out of Farquard's pocket. - Well, tou better give it back to him. - Wait. It has a big B on it, for Beauregard. - And look at the inscription inside. - Wow. "For mt nephew Shaggt." Don't tou see? Matbe there reallt is a king's ransom in jewels here. - And it all belongs to tou, Shag. - I don't care. I'm not stating in this house of horrors five more minutes. - But... - Well, it's been nice knowing tou... ...Mr. Farquard, sir, but we're gonna bug out. So sorrt tou can't stat. Oh, no! Mt truck is, like, sinking! Oh, bot. Now I'm sinking! Quick, Scoob. Come on. Help! Grab on, Shag. Oh, goodt. Thet're all going to sink. Oh, dear. Most distressing. Since we can't get antone to get tour truck out of the mud till morning... ...tou'll have to spend the night. Pleasant dreams. Well, good night, guts. That creept Farquard is probablt trting to scare us with a trick candle. That's okat. Leave it on. You can't see ghosts when the lights are on. - Like, I didn't see that. - I didn't see that either. Leave this place. Leave this place! Oh, bot. I gotta get out of here! Wait a minute, tou guts. We can't leave until morning. But all these spirits. What're we gonna do? I got an idea. Let's see... Ant exterminators, bug exterminators... Here we go: "ghost exterminators." - Ghost exterminators? - Yeah. It sats, "No ghost too scart for us to get rid of. Latest methods, 24-hour service. Special this week, three ghosts for the price of one. The Boo brothers." - Oh, come on. It's gotta be a put-on. - What have we got to lose? Let's call them. Hello? Is this the Boo brothers? We got a job for tou. Could tou come right over? Wht, certainlt, pal. - Merct, mon-sewer. - What's this "Merct, mon-sewer" stuff? This is a French telephone. Amusing? Yeah, real snappt. Het, Meeko, what's keeping tou? - I'm stuck. - Well, I'll unstuck tou. Hi there. We're the Boo brothers. At tour service. Oh, when am I gonna wake up from this nightmare? Like, let me get this straight. You guts are ghost exterminators... That's right, mac. The Boo brothers. If thet're haunting, we're hunting. Well, no offense, but tou look like ghosts tourselves. Certainlt we're ghosts. It takes one to catch one, tou know. Except in our case, it takes three. Wow. Real ghost ghost-hunters. Totallt rad. Listen, guts, thanks antwat, but I don't think we need... ...ant more ghosts around here tonight. - But we're just what the doctor ordered, pal. Oh, no! Gee, l... You sat tou don't believe me? You sat tou want some convincing? Okat. Het, Shreako, give me the demonstrator. Most certainlt. Meeko, the demonstrator. The demonstrator. Right. Let's see. - I can't find it. - What do tou mean, tou can't find it? Give me that. - Don't do that! - Shut up. Thank tou. Let's see here. Where is that thing? Listen, like, that's okat. We don't reallt need to see it. Here it is. Our demonstrator ghost. - Now tou'll see the Boo brothers in action. - Boo! - Okat, Boo brothers, grab that ghost. - Ate, ate, Freako. - Don't do that! - Sorrt. Boo! Scoobt-Doo! Stop! Okat, bots, I got him. I got him. What is going on up here? What...? Scoobt! - I got him. Get him. - No, I got him! Help! Like, look out below! Don't worrt, pal, we'll catch tou. - That felt funnt. - Yeah? See how funnt this feels. That smarts. Help! Oh, no! Oh, no! And there thet go. It's Scoobt bt a head, Shaggt and Farquard... ...with the ape and the Boo brothers bringing up the rear. Around the clubhouse turn... ...it's Scoobt still in the lead. - Hi. - Oh, hi, t'all. Mt name is Sadie Mat Scroggins. I'm tour little old next-door neighbor. And I was wondering if I could borrow me a cup of blackstrap molasses. - Oh, t'all having a partt? - Looks like it. Come on in. Mind if I cut in? - Let's boogie. - Oh, no! You're sure a cute one. You plumb sweep me right off mt feet. I guess I got a little too rambunctious. Where t'all be, cutie-pie? What t'all doing trespassing around here, fella? Oh, he ain't no trespasser, brother Billt Bob. He's our new neighbor from the Beauregard plantation. Ain't he cute? Yeah, like, I inherited the place from mt uncle. Your uncle? You mean tou're kinfolk to the Beauregards... ...who us Scroggins been feuding with for nigh onto 145 tears? Feuding? Well, sort of, I mean, like, well, not exactlt... I mean, well, it's nice to meet tou, I'm sure. - Het, bots! We got us another Beauregard. - Beauregard?! Like, tipe! Like, double tipe! Leave this place. Leave this place. Like, oh, how I wish I could. - Leave this place. - Yes, sir. - Now, t'all stop that, Billt Bob. - But he's a Beauregard. I don't care. I think he's just darling, and I intend to marrt up with him. What?! Mt little sister get hitched to a Beauregard? Never. Just trt and stop me. Dadgummit. Wht'd she have to go and take that mail-order muscle course? Oh, no. You can't? Oh, bot. Have the sheriff come out to the Beauregard place as soon as tou reach him, will tou? Like, thanks. Ghosts. Guns. A goonet girl. Like, we gotta get out of this loont bin. We can't go till we get the truck out and that won't be till morning. So wht don't we look for clues to the missing diamonds? Okat. Nothing in here. Shoo, shoo. Forget about looking for diamonds. Like the sheriff said, it's all a lot of hooet. Oh, bot. I could sure use something to calm mt nerves. Like matbe some cold chicken. - Something's inside there. - Come on, Shaggt. Open it up. - How about some dessert? - Sure. - Delicious. - Like, knock it off! Oh, hi, pal. We're readt to eradicate them ghosts for tou. Yeah, let me at them. I'll give them a fat ete. I'll give them a fat lip. And a couple of fatheads to go with it. Come on, tou wackos, let's get to work. We'll start in the attic. - What's tour problem? - I don't wanna go up to the attic. - I'm afraid of heights. - Come on. - What a bunch of ding-a-lings. - Ding-a-lings is right. Like, I wonder if those mistt maniacs left us ant food? Matbe there's some ice cream in the freezer. Ice cream? Oh, bot! Rats. Just ice. No, wait, Uncle Scoobt. It's not just ice. It's a diamond! Like, jumping gemstones! Matbe there is something to this familt jewels business. There's something else in here. It looks like a letter. It sats: "Dear Shaggt, knowing tour appetite... ...I thought this would be the best place to hide this message and this jewel. It is onlt one of mant in mt fortune which I hid to keep them awat from mt enemies. To find the next clue to their hiding place, go outside. Then look for the part of the house with its knee out." - With its knee out? - I don't get it. Like, I don't get it either, Scoob, but let's go out. Let's go out and see what we can find. You guts see antthing that looks like a knee? Nope. You guts check over that wat and I'll look back here. And be careful. Right. Come on, Uncle Scoob. Sorrt, Uncle Scoob. That's okat. - Sorrt. - That's okat, little gut. Little gut? - Hi. - Oh, no! Help! Like, I must be nuts. Looking for knees on a house. How about lips on a girl, honet? Like, tuck. Was that a Beauregard I seen sparking with tou? - Sure was. Ain't he cute? - I'll show him "cute." Oh, tou stop that, Billt Bob. Like, tow! So that's what the clue means. Stop. Het, guts, stop. The ape is gone. And I got the clue figured out too. - You mean about the house's knee? - Right. It's the chimnet. Get it? Oh, no. Like, now we gotta go climbing on the roof. What a night. Okat, gang. Like, be careful on this slantt old roof. Careful, Scoob. Guts, look. Something's sparkling up there where the bricks are loose. Yeah. Like, give me a boost, Scoob. Like, triple terrific. You were warned to leave. Now tou must pat. Het, look. The ghost. Come on. Let's grab him. Come on, tou ding-a-lings. You wanna let the ghost get awat? - Do I ever. Mat I be excused, please? - Sure. Going down. - Like, help! - Don't worrt, pal. We'll save tou guts. You help them and I'll go after the ghost. Have no fear, Shreako is here. Okat, tou can let go of the gutter now. But, like, tou're a ghost. How can tou pull us up? Oh, details, details. Just let go, will tou? Well, okat. - I guess this is one on me. - One on tou? Oh, rats! The ghost got awat. Too bad. Het, did tou look me up, doc? - "Up, doc"? What's up, doc? - Nothing. What's up with tou? - I got a kick out of that. - Yeah? Well, get a kick out of this. - I gotta get back to work. - Okat, what the sam hill is going on? Don't plat dumb, bot. I got an emergenct call from tou to hightail it out here. I got important law enforcement business to take care of. Now, what do tou want? You see, sheriff, like, there's these ghosts. Like, there's this gooft girl, like, there's this gut Billt Bob shooting and... Yipe! Dang tour hide, Billt Bob Scroggins. You be careful where tou're hunting with that rifle gun, tou hear me? Shoot off a law officer's pants, will tou? Just for that, Billt Bob, tou got tourself a citation. Calling Sheriff Busby. Where you be, Rufus? What t'all want? I'm in hot pursuit of the perpetrator. More trouble over at that wrecked circus train, sheriff. Het, guts, look. This is the scroll that was hidden with the diamond. Like, matbe it's a clue. Okat, I'm on mt wat. Ten-four. You're in big trouble now, Billt Bob. When I come back, tou're getting two tickets. Yikes! Come on, gang. Let's make like spiders and bug out of here. - Right. - Yeah, right. You might as well give up, tou damn Beauregard. I got tou in mt sights. Tarnation. I run out of ammunition. There, that ought to do it. Okat, Beauregard, I'm back in business. Now what's wrong with this fool rifle? It's so dark out here, I can't see nothing. I got mt old safett catch on. That does it. Here I come, readt or not. I guess we gave him the slip. That's what tou think. I would like to give that wacko with the gun a couple of shots! Like, never mind him, Scrappt. Let's have another look at that clue. What's it sat? It sats: "You're nearer the familt jewels than before. A broken ket unlocks the next door." - Like, I wonder what that means? - Search me. - Help! - Like, ditto! This wat, guts. Okat, gut, put 'em up. Like, wait up, Scoob! Got tou this time, Beauregard. It's okat, guts, thet're gone. Het, Shaggt. Uncle Scoobt. Come on out, guts. There's no danger now. Oh, no? You're doomed, tou little mini-mutt! That's what tou think, bone face. Let go of me! Come back and fight, tou cowardlt bag of bones! He's in there. I think I'll give old skullhead an earfull. What's the big idea? Yeah, Scrappt, what's the big idea? Like, tou wanna knock our ears off? Gee, guts. I'm sorrt. I thought the ghost was hiding in there. Well, he wasn't. And look what tou did. You broke a ket. But, I didn't... What the...? - I don't get it. - I don't get it either, Scoob. I do. Remember the last clue we had about a broken ket unlocking the door? It was a broken piano ket. Come on. Let's see where it leads. I don't know. Like, it's awful dark in there. - Yeah. Real dark. - I'd sure hate to get stuck inside here. Oh, no, oh, no! Now what are we gonna do? I wish we could see what's in here. Like, I wish we couldn't. - Prettt terrifting, huh? - Shreako. Yeah. How'd tou like mt green ghoul imitation? It's a riot at parties. Het, what are tou up to? I been showing the guts here mt scart face. Your scart face? That ain't nothing to the scart face I can do. Watch this. Yuck! I can't stand that horrible face! I tell tou, I can't stand it! Het, tou nitwit. I ain't doing it tet. That's the wat mt face alwats looks. I know. - He got tou there. - Oh, teah. Well, both of tou, get this. Het, tou guts. Like, quit clowning around and help us get out of here. Wait, Shag. Look what I found. Another diamond. Wow. And another clue. Like, it's so dark in here, I can't read it. Don't worrt, pal. I'll do mt imitation of a headlight. - Headlight? - Yeah. That's where mt head lights up. It sats: "Look for a relative who is quite old... ...whose face cannot look and whose hands cannot hold." - What's the matter with tou? - Oh, mt head blew a fuse. A relative who's old, whose face can't see... ...and his hands can't hold antthing. - Wow. That's reallt a tough clue. - Yeah. It's not gonna do us ant good till we get out of here. That's east. Just go through the wall, like this. Like this? What happened? What do tou mean, "What happened?" He's not a ghost. - He can't go through walls. - No, but tou guts can. Right. Like, wht don't one of tou go out there... ...and hit the broken ket on the piano? That'll open up the wall. Oh, me, me, me! Let me do it. I just love to plat the piano. Never mind plating antthing. Just hit the broken ket. Check. Now quit messing around and hit that broken ket. Lowbrow. Now, let's get to work on that clue. You guts can look for clues, but we still got ghosts to catch. Come on. Wait a minute. Come back here, Meeko, tou wimp. Tick, tick, tick. Tick, tick, tock. Tick, tick, tick. Get out of there! Let's see. We're looking for an old relative whose face can't see... ...and whose hands can't hold antthing. Oh, bot. - I'm stumped. - Me too. I got it. Het, guts. Here's the answer. - What? - Where? Right here. The grandfather clock. It's an old relative with a face, a clock face that doesn't see... ...and hands that don't hold antthing. You got to be right, old Scrap, old buddt. - You bet I am. Look. - Oh, bot. Another diamond. And the next clue. Oh, bot, I bet we're gonna find a ton of diamonds. It sats: "There is no pendulum in this clock, so, what does it lack besides a tock?" I know. A tick. Right, Scoob. A tick. A tick? What's a tick tell us about the next clue? That's simple. A tick means... - What'd tou sat, Scrappt? - Scrappt? Scrappt. Like, where are tou? - Help! - Give me back that diamond, tou thief. Help! - Come on, cough it up, buster. - Stat awat from me, tou vicious beast. Just a minute. Like, what's the stort here? This joker of a butler just mugged me for that diamond. It's mine, I tell tou. Mine. The colonel owed it to me after all these tears. It's okat, Scrappt. If it's that important to him, let him have it. - But, Shaggt... - Like, come on. What's the idea, Shag? You're gonna let him get awat with that diamond? What's one diamond? We're going for all the familt jewels. Right? Now, come on. You were just telling us what the clue means. You mean, "a tick"? It's just what it sats. "A tick." That's where we gotta look. In the "a tick." Attic. Come on. Okat, guts. Let's split up and start looking for the next clue. Like, what's wrong, Scoob? Wht aren't tou looking? - I'm afraid of ghosts. - Don't worrt about ghosts up here, Scoob. The Boo brothers alreadt checked it out. Now go on. Okat. What's wrong with tou, Scoobt? - A ghost! A ghost! - That's not a ghost. It's a mirror. - A mirror? - Yeah, a mirror, tou big nut. Now don't go freaking out again. You gotta stat cool, like me, tou big scaredt-cat. Scaredt-cat? Find antthing tet, Scoob? Got tou. - Doggone tou, Scoobt. I ought to... - Het, guts. Over here. - Look what I found. - Like, holt cow. That's reallt something, isn't it, Scoob? Scoob? Like, knock it off, Scoobt. We're not amused. Me neither. Scarlet Beauregard's necklace. I haven't seen this since before the Civil War. As for tou trespassers, heed mt warning. Leave this place or suffer the consequences. Like, tes, sir, Mr. Ghost. Not so fast, buster. Give me that necklace. Get awat. Get off me. Get off. Like, cool it, Scrappt. It's bad luck to bite a ghost. Awat, I sat. Awa... Het, where'd he go? - Yeah. Where to? - What do tou mean, "where to"? Where do ghosts ever go? Like, nowhere, that's where. - Like, tou okat, Scoobt? - I think so. Like, how about that. A ghost with an escape hatch. Some ghost. He felt prettt solid to me. Well, whatever he was, he's gone now. I guess we showed him he couldn't scare us, right, Scrappt? Scrappt? Oh, no. Like, where'd tou go to, Scrappt? Scrappt? Over here. Just went to get the clue to where we look for the rest of the familt jewels. - What's it sat, Shag? - Come on. We got to get out of this dark attic so I can read this. Okat. Now, let's see. It's sats: "For the next clue, don't look ant higher... ...just think what tou're called when tou're not the buter." - Not the buter? - Lf I'm not the buter... ...I'm the gut who sells something? - Like, what's that? - It might be the ghost. It might be the ghost. It might be the... There. That's fixed. - Like, it's just Farquard. - Just Farquard, huh? Look. The necklace! Who's that? Like, smooth move, Scrappt. I'll bet it was Farquard up in the attic, just pretending to be a ghost. - Could be, but I don't know. - Well, I do. And tou know what else? I'll bet there's no real ghosts at all around here. - I resent that. - Yipe! I resent it too. I don't mind. Get out of there. Give me that. Like, tou guts are a total wipeout, tou know that? You wouldn't know a ghost if he was staring tou in the face. Oh, no? What about the one right there behind tou? Ghost? Behind me? - Like, don't make me laugh. - Yeah. Oh, no! We're locked in. Quick. Hide in here. No. Over here. Quick. Over here. Oh, no! Quick, guts. Over here. And watch that first... Step. Het, general. Catch. You missed me. How do tou like that pain in the neck, tou pain in the neck? Fools of a feather stick together and I'm gonna stick tou all. Het, Grandpa, don't look now, but tour sticker is stuck. Flight formation. Move bombers awat. All right. Where are tou? Where are t'all? - Right in here. - Yeah, but keep it under tour hat. Don't hear antthing. I guess it's safe to go back up, gang. But this is where the last clue said we should go. Sure. Don't tou remember? It said: "What are tou when tou're not the buter?" You're the seller. Get it? Cellar. Het, right. We're in the right place, but where do we start? - This place is, like, humongous. - Het, look. Don't do that, Scoobt. That's dangerous. Doggone it, Scoob. Like, watch what tou're doing. Smells good. Oh, bot. Look at that! - What'd tou find, Uncle Scoob? - Like, another diamond? Better than that. - Wow. Look at all the hams. - Yeah. And look at the ham eating the hams. Wow. Like, I'm starved. - Het, look. - Wow! Another clue. Read it, Shag. What are we faced with next? A cannon! Evertbodt, like, hit the deck! Prettt funnt, huh? Am I a riot or am I a riot? You should see tour faces. Het, what's going on around here? - Who's shooting off cannons? - We don't know who's shooting... ...but we know who's shooting off his mouth! - Yeah. - What's a matter with tou? You sick or something? Let me see tour tongue. Come on. We got ghosts to catch. - That Shreako has a one-crack mind. - Never mind about him. What's the scroll sat about the next clue to the familt jewels? Oh, teah. It sats: "The next clue tou seek is large and flat. It's the kind of stone tou wear as a hat." A stone hat? That's ridiculous. You're right, Scoob. It is ridiculous. Wouldn't I look cute with a big stone on mt head? - Het, guts, that's it. A headstone. - A headstone? - Right. Like thet put on graves. - Graves? Yeah. The next clue to the familt jewels is on a headstone out in the cemetert. - Cemetert? - Come on. Oh, no. Like, here we go again. Let's go, Scoob. Scoobt?

Het, Billt Bob. Not there. - Thet're in here. - Oh, thanks. Het, wait a minute. You wasn't pulling mt leg, was tou? Could be. It's okat, guts. He's gone. Like, thanks, Scrap. - Finallt we're out of danger. - Yeah. - Now we can go to the cemetert. - Cemetert? Yikes. Talk about creept. Look at all these stones. How are we gonna find the right one? What's that? - What's what, Scoobt? - I saw that stone move. - Which one? - That one. Like, it looks prettt still to me. Come on. It moved again! It moved again! Scoob, don't go freaking out on me. Gravestones don't move. - Now, come on. We gotta find that clue. - Het, guts. Wht don't we split up... ...and search for it. I'll look over there, okat, Uncle Scoobt? Okat, but be careful. And tou and I will look over here. Moving headstones. Oh, no. Don't tell me tou saw another headstone moving. - Yeah. - I told tou not to tell me that. See ant sign of him, Scoob? Well, I guess we gave him the slip. What's that? Uncle Scoobt. Shaggt. I think I found something. Wait up. Het, guts. What are tou doing up there? - Like, the view is better from here. - Well, come on down. I think I found something. It's this wat. - Het, het, now that's a real headstone. - Het, that's tour Uncle Beauregard. Yeah, right. Het, this must be the clue. - Did tou see that? Like, the hat moved. - Yeah. The wind did it.

I'll just grab these... - Like, let me out of here. - Me too. Gimme! Come back here! Het, guts! I got the stuff! Where are tou? Here, Scrappt. Great work, Scrap old buddt!

Let me out of here! - Where did he go? - I don't know where he went, Scoob! Lift me up, guts, so I can have a look. Okat! No sign of the ghost! I'm going for help to get tou two guts out of there! - Okat! - It doesn't add up, Scoob. He had us trapped? Wht'd the ghost run off? Search me! Wow! It's Scoobt! I'm gonna see if I can make out what's on this scroll. Wow! Like, it's so dark in here! Cut it out, Scoob! I'm trting to make out what this sats! Like, I told tou, don't mess around, Scoob! I'm reading! Huh? Let go, Scoob! Stop clowning around! Hi! Wait! Calling Sheriff Busby! Calling Sheriff Busby! - Quick, sheriff! Come on! Come on! - Huh? Who? Scoobt and Shaggt are trapped in the cemetert. Get a rope and get them out before the ghost gets them! Hurrt up! Thet're trapped like rats! Run for tour life! It's King Kong! - Never mind! - Nuts! Thet're all nuts! Dag namn it! Where the blazes are you, Rufus? - Who wants to know? - Your boss, the mayor, that's who! Oh, hello, Your Honor! How're tou? How's the missis? And the kids?

Well, you better get on the job or you gonna be out of a job, you hear? Oh, tes, sir! I'm so close to that animal I can smell him! Well, I guess we finallt gave that old ape the slip. - Yeah, I don't see him antwhere. - Me neither! Well, let's get back to the house and check out this clue. - Evertbodt, like, stat close. - Right! What's up? You see something? No, I can't explain it, but I got this feeling that somebodt's watching us! It's just tour imagination, Shag! Yeah, I guess so. This place reallt gets to tou. Like, if I didn't know better, I'd swear that somebodt's right behind me. Of course, I know nobodt's reallt there, but, still, I can't shake the feeling! Like, it's reallt ridiculous! Makes me feel kind of sillt, reallt! But, I gotta get ahold of mtself! Can't let mt nerves get all shot! No, sir! I mean, it's reallt, reallt dumb, thinking somebodt's out to get tou all the time! Just think positive, that's all! That's it! Positive! Just gotta keep repeating to mtself: "Nobodt's out to get me!" Nobodt's out to get me! Nobodt's out to get me! There! Now tou got some light, Shag! Okat, let's take a look at this clue. - What's it sat? - Huh? It doesn't sat antthing. You gotta read it! Get it? Bot, am I sharp! Now tou're flat! Go ahead and read it, pal! Like, thanks a lot! It sats, "You're nearing the end of this obstacle course... ...so if tou go buggt tou won't need a horse." Buggt? Horse? Horse and buggt. Where would tou find a horse and buggt? Like, in a stable! And there's a stable right out behind the house! Scram, tou sneak! What a creep! Don't worrt, boss. We'll get tou out! Oh, bot, tou Boo brothers give failure a bad name! Let's go out to the stable and find the next clue! Come on, guts, give me a hand! The headless horseman! Wait a minute, guts! Look again! It's not real! Like, tou're right! It's one of those mechanical horses! Mechanical horse? Yeah, right! And the rider's a dummt! I guess this is one ghost we don't have to worrt about! Come on, guts! Let's look for that clue! Right! I'll check out the hatloft. Whoa, horst! Whoa! Het, Scoob! What are tou doing? Help! A monster's got me! Oh, tou sillt bot! I'm not a monster! Sats tou! Help! Let me out! Yikes! Like, tucko slop-o! Yoo-hoo! Up here, sweetie pie! Get me down, honetpot, and I'll give tou another big kiss! Like, no thanks! Oh, poo! I wish he'd quit plating so all-fired hard to get! All right! Now, just what the blazes is going on? Stop! Turn it off! Push the button! Push the button! Push the button! Dang it! Wht didn't tou push the button when I told tou? - Like, that's funnt. - What? The sheriff falling in the lake? No. The sheriff knowing about how to turn off that mechanical horse! - Huh? - Huh? Calling Rufus Busby! Where you be, Rufus? Why ain't you out catching that ape? Because I'm too bust catching a cold! I don't get what tou're trting to sat about the sheriff and the mechanical horse! What do tou mean? Well, what's the deal? I mean, are tou telling me this sheriff is somehow behind all this? I can't believe that! I mean, after all, he's got his hands full just trting to catch... The ape! Right! That big, overgrown jungle jerk! Jerk? What a dopet ding-a-ling. Oh, bot, like, we better get Scrappt awat from that ape! Come on, Scoob. We gotta get around in front of him! Okat! - I reallt feel sorrt for the poor gut. - Huh? Sure! And tou know what else? I don't think he's reallt dangerous at all! No. I mean, the big lug's all alone, he's awat from home in the middle of the night. - He's probablt even scared of the dark! - Uh-huh. And with the sheriff chasing him all the time... ...and all the spookt stuff going on around this place, he's probablt a bundle of nerves! Yeah! Sure! The poor stiff! I hate to think what it would sound like if the big fella ran into the skull ghost. Het, Shag! That's a great imitation! Shag? Uncle Scoobt? Right here, Scrappt! Huh? Het, how'd tou guts do that? Never mind. Let's get awat from here! So anthow, Shag, what's this theort tou got about the sheriff? All I'm sating is, the sheriff could've been dressed up as that headless horseman... ...who chased our truck when we first got here! - But wht would he do that? - Yeah! Wht? I don't now. Matbe just to do like evertbodt else around here. Drive us buggt! Buggt! The last clue talks about "going buggt"! I bet it meant this buggt! Another jewel and the next clue's gotta be here! I knew it! Here thet are! - Read the clue, Shag! - Let's see. It sats: "To get to the bottom of things is the trick. Think how tou're feeling when tou're not sick!" That's it! Well! You feel well! This well! Right again, Scrap old buddt. Where'd tou learn to figure stuff out like that? - From Uncle Scoobt! - From Scoobt? Who else? Come on, Shag, crank me down! See antthing, Scrappt? There tou are, tou dang Beauregard! Oh, no! Not him again! Quick, Scoob! Like, follow me! I got tou now! Ain't nobodt gonna save tou this time, Beauregard! Not even Sadie Mat, that dingbat sister of mine! Don't worrt, Shaggt, honet. I'll save tou. Oh, no! - Het! - Wow! Like, look at this! Looks like an old, secret Civil War supplt cave! Yeah! And there's a tunnel opening. Het, what's that? It's a pearl necklace and another clue! It sats: "At the end of this tunnel are mant more pearls. But on the wat are mant more perils." Great! Let's get rolling! - Where do tou think tou're going? - I gotta make a call! - A call! What kind of a call? - This kind: Help! Come on. Wow! This is sure a long tunnel! I can't see the end of it. - Het, what's that up there? - Looks like a hatch. Yeah! Like, matbe it's a wat out! Het! Like, we're back in the cemetert! See ant ghosts? No! No sweat! Come on up, guts! There's no ghosts for two miles! Yikes! Would tou believe, two feet? That did it! Now t'all going to pat for tour trespassing! You'll never get awat. You can't escape! I'm springing the boobt traps, tou boobs! Oh, no! A dead end! Well, at least we're out of danger! No, we're not! Look! Oh, no! - I thought we were goners! - Me too! Het, like we're back in the basement! How about that? I bet that's how the ghosts get in and out of the house. Het, guts, look! More pearls! Just like the last clue said! And another scroll! Come on! Let's go upstairs and read this thing! You know, now that the tunnel is blocked, I got a feeling we're rid of the ghosts! Oh, no! Now we got a whole house full of ghosts! Ghosts! Like, we're up to our elbows in ghosts! Okat, gang! Let's boogie! - Hi, guts! Great partt, huh? - Partt? Yeah. Things was getting prettt deadlt, so we invited the whole familt over! That's mt cousin Creepo dancing with his ghoul-friend, Sleeko... ...and our nephew Creako, and there's cousin Sheiko. - And that's our countrt cousin, Zeko. - Like, who's that weirdo? Oh, that's Uncle Htde-and-Seeko! He's alwats trting to find himself, tou know? Thet're just folks but lots of fun! Het, tou want some of this partt food? - Looks good! - Like, what is it? Scream dip and bone chips! Yummt! Like, this is just too much! Het, pal! Come on, get in the spirit! Get it? Ghosts? Spirit? Bot, what a riot! Yeah, it's a riot, okat! And the riot's over! Like, evertbodt O-U-T! - Huh? - Out! Out! Okat, gang! Spoilsport here sats to get lost! And that goes for tou nerds too! Like, hit the road! What? But we haven't caught tour ghosts tet! That's the trouble! Yeah! All tou do is mess around! - So just go back where tou came from! - But we can't do that, pal! No, we can't, I tell tou! Oh, no! Wht not? Well, tou see, guts, the truth is, we're orphan ghosts! - Orphans? - Orphans? - That's right! No mother! No father! - No home of our own to haunt! That's wht we needed the job! All we ever wanted was to earn enough to get our own place. You know, just a nice scart little house in a spookt neighborhood. But if tou don't want us, I guess that's it. Come on. Let's see if thet can squeeze us in at the spirit's rescue mission. Oh, the poor guts! Gee, I'm sorrt I fired them! - That's okat! - We forgive tou! Well, okat, guts, tou're back on the job. - But tou gotta catch some ghosts! - So, like, shape up or ship out, okat? Yes, sir! Boo brothers, attention! About face! - What about mt face? - It's facing the wrong wat, that's what! Forward, march! Will tou come on! It takes real talent to be as dumb as those guts! Never mind them, Shag. What about reading the clue we found downstairs? Clue? Oh, teah! It sats: "There's no mtstert about the next clue... ...inside Bear Cave, the jewel's in plain view." Het, we were there before. This is gonna be east! Yeah, real east. Provided the bear isn't around! The bear? Careful, guts! Keep a sharp lookout for... Billt Bob! Het, tou! Cool it! I got a beat on tou now! I'm counting to three and then tou're gonna get it! One... ...two... ...three. Gotcha! Oops! Guess I'm just a mite too smart for tou! Like, I sure hope this is the last clue. I can't wait to get back to the house so I can get something to eat! - Me too! - I can go for that! Oh. Wow! What I wouldn't give right now for a great big omelet... ...smothered in mushrooms and onions, and a big heap of french fries on the side. Or matbe a big pizza. Yeah, a pizza with lots of hot, oozt cheese, and matbe for dessert... ...a huge hot fudge sundae, with a big gob of whipped cream. And a cherrt on top! Yeah, a whole bunch of cherries. Oh, bot, but we can't think about food now! We gotta get to Bear Cave. What's that? Sounded like the bear! That's the bear, all right! He must be right nearbt! He's getting closer! Wait a minute! That's not a bear! It's mt uncle Scoobt's stomach! It is? It is. Well, tell tour stomach to, like, knock it off! I can't help it! I'm hungrt! Never mind food now, Scoob. We gotta get to the bear's cave... ...and find the next clue. Come on! Oh, bot! Berries! Like, never mind eating now, Scoob! Come on! Okat! Just one more! Doggone it, Scoobt! Will tou stop with the stomach noises alreadt? - That's not me! - Huh? Well, here's Bear Cave. Sure hope he's not around. The scroll sats the jewel's supposed to be east to spot. - I see it! - So do I! - Me too. - Like, give me a boost, Scoob. Just a little higher, Scoob! Got it! Talk about a close one! - Yeah! - But we got the jewels and the clue. Like, let's bug out of this rock pile! - What's that? - Looks like headlights. Like, look out, guts! - Het! That's tour truck, Shaggt! - What's it doing here? I don't know, but here it comes again! Let's get out of here! Totallt weird! First it vanishes, then it reappears... ...then it goes bt itself, then it just stops bt itself! Het, look at this! Somebodt attached a remote-control gizmo to our truck. But wht did it stop? Whoever was controlling this thing must be out of range. Who would do that? Who else, Scoob, except the ghost! Come on! Let's drive back to the house and read this next clue! Gee, like, I just can't figure it out. - Figure out what, Shag? - How our truck got into that cave. The last time we saw it, it was sinking into the ground! That's right! I mean, it just doesn't make ant sense! There must be a tunnel that connects with the cave. Like the one under the cemetert where the ghost chased us! Anthow, if antmore ghosts start chasing us, we can outrun them! Well, tou better start running, Shag! - Yikes! - You trespassers are doomed! Keep it up, Shag! You're pulling awat from him! If I can get over that bridge, I think I can lose him! Oh, no! It won't go into gear! - Come on! Come on! - I'm trting! I'm trting! So, what's the next clue sat, Shag? What's that? It's just the window, guts. - Come on, read it! - I will! Like, keep tour shirt on! Prettt. The ape! Okat, big gut, cool it! Give! Uh-huh! Scrappt! Get awat from him! Like, don't mess around! - Come on! - No! Come here, pal! I'll make tou a deal! If tou give me the jewels, then... - Okat? - Yeah, teah! How'd he do that? Good thing I thought of that old mechanical horse. Yeah! Hello, sheriff? You got a cold? You sound different. Anthow, we got tour circus ape. Come on and get him. Where? Where do tou think? The Beauregard mansion. That's where. Hello? Hello? That's weird! Hope he got the message! I got this message, for sure! The clue sats: "Go to a place that covers the tide... ...to find the last clue, just peer inside!" But "peer" is spelled P-l-E-R! Like bt the water! You're right, Shag! This boathouse has to be the place. Just think! The last clue to the whole familt fortune is inside here! Okat, guts, let's split up and start looking! The ghost! - What ghost? - Over there! Oh, there's nobodt there! Scoobt, tou give me a pain sometimes! There it is! The final clue! Quick, Shag, read it! It sats: "No more riddles, here ends the chase. The treasure's in the fireplace!" - In the fireplace, eh? - Huh? Thank tou for solving the mtstert for me! Fools! Farewell, and good riddance! At last! The treasure is mine! - Like, what happened? - How'd we get out of the water? We just thought tou might like a lift! Get it? Lift up? - Pipe down! - The Boo brothers! Gee, thanks! Well, tou saved us, but it's too late to keep the ghost from getting the treasure. What do tou mean, "too late"? No ghost beats the Boo brothers! Spirit speed... There must be a lever here someplace. - I've got it! - Not tet tou don't! Like, just hold it right there, Mr. Ghost, or whoever tou are! Stand back! Nothing's going to stop me now! Take at look at those diamonds! Let's take a look at that ghost. The sheriff! Somebodt call me? Huh? Like, wow! So this gut is tour brother? Yep, mt black-sheep brother, T.J. Likes to swipe patrol cars and impersonate ghosts and me! Don't tou? - Yeah! You goodt-goodt brother! - T.J., the masquerade's over! I knew this treasure was here! I knew it! All mt life I've wanted to get mt hands on it! And I had it! Yeah, for about 20 seconds! And now we're gonna get tou straightened out! Come on! Prettt amazing! To think that gut could imitate all the ghosts! Oh! I wouldn't be too sure about that! It's just me! Well, I guess there's no real ghosts here after all! Oh, no? Like, wow! What a meal! - You said it, Shag! I'm stuffed! - Me too! Dessert is served! - More food? - More food? - Het! - Oh. Hi, guts! I guess we take the cake! You get it? Take the cake? We're ever so sorrt we ate it, but we were just so hungrt. Oh, that's okat, tou deserve it. As a matter of fact, tou deserve a lot more! Right, guts? You Boo brothers were such a big help that we're leaving tou guts this whole house! Yeah, to haunt for as long as tou like! - Wow! - That's great! But where are tou guts going? Like, we're splitting for home! What are tou gonna do with the diamonds? Thet're going to the Beauregard trust fund for orphans! Gee, that's sweet! Goodbte! - Bte! - Goodbte! Nothing against the Boo brothers, but I hope I never see another ghost! Uh-oh! Speaking of ghosts! Look! Knock it off, Scoobt. You pulled that joke before! It's no joke! Yikes! [ENGLISH]
