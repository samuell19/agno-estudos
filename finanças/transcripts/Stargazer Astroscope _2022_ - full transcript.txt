Right, what am I to ASTRO? I'm not sure. I've never thought about it before. Me? Well... Wouldn't I be a precious member to them? What am I to ASTRO? Let's see... Good question... I've never thought about that before. I don't want to think about it too deeply. Yes... Let's go, let's go, let's go. Okay, let's get in. What was this for? It's for our concert, right? It's the concert... No, actually, we are at the showcase right now. We did well. - Hey, what's this called? - Can you scoot back a bit? - Move back a little? - Hello! What's the title of this movie? Isn't there a title yet? Don't forget my idea. Is there any idea for the movie's title? The title? ASTRO, A-S-T-R-O. It means star, celestial body, so... ASTRO means "star." So the movie is like looking at us through a telescope. It's like looking up at the stars and seeing how they move. [STARGAZER: ASTROSCOPE] The Candy Sugar Pop showcase just ended. But we're also gearing up for our concert. So we're here to practice for a bit. Our day doesn't end just because the showcase is over. We did so many things today. This time, we are... We always think about this kind of situation-How to do it more efficiently. But there isn't time for that now. - We just have to do it. - That's right. I'll work hard to get home. Fighting! Honestly, I felt pressured because there just wasn't enough time. Since MJ is getting enlisted in the army, we had to change all of our choreography to the five-member formation. A lot of things overlapped. The concert is not even two weeks away. We've rearranged all the choreography for five members. We just have to keep practicing. But there are still other things like, unit and solo performances. This is when it's always a race against time, and we all get anxious. It's extra hectic this time since the concert overlapped with our comeback. To be honest... I'm a bit nervous. I have so many things on my mind these days that I can't think of anything. I can't think of anything because I have too much on my mind. I mean... I don't know how I feel lately as well. We have until Sunday to practice the five-member formation. There are still details and positions to determine and think of new gestures. That's because we have to take over MJ's part. I'm exhausted. Let's gather to practice. Okay, coming! The hardest part was that there wasn't much time to prepare for the concert. We had other schedules on top of it, so that was the most challenging part. Honestly, back in the day, I wondered why we were an even-numbered group. It's because dance formations are very limited for even-numbered members. So I thought it'd be easier if we were an odd-numbered group. But it was tough once we became a member short. We had our own strengths, and we were perfectly in tune. I came to realize I had taken that for granted. But step by step, the five of us were able to make it work. And besides... We had to. We had to get used to it. Despite all the worries right now, a month or a year would pass in the blink of an eye. That's something that really hit me. All the work will be finished, after all. What brings you here? - We're making a movie. - A movie? Is there going to be a movie? Here are the stars of our movie. Let them show on the camera. Let me introduce them one by one. JinJin! This is JinJin the Rascal. - R-Jin. - R-Jin. And this is MJ the Reckless. - R-MJ. - R-Jin and R-MJ. Hey, look at him acting. Over there is Rocky the Celebrity. C-Rocky. And there is San-ha the Handful. Eun-woo the Chiseled. And I'm... I shall name myself Moonbin, the Manager. Is this for the behind-the-scenes? The concert behind-the-scene footage? - We're making a movie. - A movie? I wondered how it'd come out when I first heard about it. That's what first came to mind. Is the concert video going to be made into a movie? Will there be a screening? Even preparations for the concert included? We'd never done anything like this before, so it was hard to imagine. It sounds fun. - Did you have fun, AROHA? - Did you have a good time? I knew it! Let's head over to the stage together. Let's go. Let's go! I'm heading to the rehearsal. Ten seconds before I finally see the stage. Hello. Hello. Let's go. Let's go. Come on! Let's go in! It's this way. I could hear the music already in the waiting room. I could hear people checking the sound, making my heart pound. How should I put it? I got excited like our very first concert. I was a bit nervous. We have to adjust our choreography and movement according to various details of the stage. So I'm checking that now, but I think we have more than enough space. There's a continuous beep sound in my in-ear monitor. So you are saying that'll become leveled? Yes, that will become flat and come down. JinJin, since you're here, do you want to try it out first? - Never mind, let's do it together later. - Yes, I'll try it out with the group. Two things came to mind. The first was that it could have been better. - Hi. - Hello. And the other thing was that I was also relieved. A lot changed when I got to rehearsal, like the sets and the space itself. They all changed for the better. The next day was the concert, so we had to see if there were any issues. That way, we could brush up before the actual stage. It rather made me get myself together. Everyone off the stage, so I can have quality time with Eun-woo. - That also includes me. - Bye. All right, then I guess I'll go over my solo performance one more time. - Okay, are you ready, Eun-woo? - I'm set. Let's go. Was there anything you found uncomfortable on stage? - No, it was fine. - I thought it was okay. How was the kinetic lift? - It was okay. - Getting on was fine. - I guess we can't do anything about this, can we? - What is it? It sticks out here. - I think we can't do anything about it. - Oh, that bump... Would you like us to make it more leveled? I believe that we can be at our best when the stage becomes a place where we can have fun. So I focused a lot on that. I like to go over details as we rehearse. As singers and performers, this is when everyone is hypersensitive. We're also using devices on stage, and accidents can happen if we misuse them. If we make a mistake or if we misread a cue from the crew, it could lead to a big accident. As the leader, JinJin organized everything for the concert. He worked the hardest on it. I was under so much pressure that I yelled at my members once. For me, while working on our concert, if the members share any constructive opinions, I'm always ready to accept their suggestions. That's not what I find hard, but when I notice our members tired and weary, it wears me down both as the leader and as someone taking part in this concert. So I mentioned it to the guys. After explaining why it was a problem and asking them to follow my lead, they followed and trusted my leadership. So I've felt and learned so much throughout this concert- From our members and the preparation process. - I forgot to bring my mic. - You don't have to rush. - I'll bring your mic. - Okay. It's so hectic. All right. We'll be okay tomorrow. I was very worried about it, but going through rehearsals has put my mind at ease. So I think we'll do well. Let's do it! ASTRO, fighting! We love you! You got this! I miss you and love you! You got this! We love you! Fighting! - Go! - Bye! Hi! - Fighting! - Fighting! Wanna be your star, ASTRO! Thank you! - Thank you! - Let's do this, everyone! - Let's do this. - Let's go. One, two, three. Move, move, fighting! - Let's go! - Let's go! Actually, when we are going up on the stairs to get on the kinetic stage, we can see everything through the curtains. It was a thrill just to see many AROHAs in the stands. But there was a particular point that moved me the most. Whenever we went to a music award ceremony or an end-of-the-year stage, I always wanted such a big venue to be filled only with AROHA. It meant a lot for us to see that dream coming true. And I was proud and moved by that the most. I got chills all over my body. It felt like I had a surge of energy running through my body. I felt like I could do everything. I wanted everything to be perfect, so I was tense from start to finish. That's how I felt. That was the most nerve-wracking time for me. It was the opening, so I couldn't help but feel anxious. It didn't even feel real. I just let my body take over and move on its own. I guess I was pretty nervous. I was spaced out at first. My mind went blank. And for a second or two, everything becomes white because of the lighting. Then my eyes start to adjust, and I can see again. So after that blank moment... "Ah!" That's how it felt. I was ready to go on stage and make it happen. The kinetic stage leaned out to bring us down, and we descended from high above. I wasn't really nervous, but I was nervous. It was really high up. I was standing at the end, and when I looked at the other members, they also seemed nervous. The five of us got on the stage with quiet tension, and then we heard everyone's cheers. So it felt like, "Let's do this." It gave me chills. Hello. Are we going to become movie stars? Rocky is someone who always does his best. Edit that out, please. These shoes mean a lot to me. I wear them for a reason. Back when I was dancing a lot, I thought even the points of my feet were important. That's when I saw this design and chose only to wear these shoes. Then all of a sudden, this model got discontinued. They were no longer available, which was a shocker. I always practiced in these shoes and thought I could dance better in them. So I ended up designing them myself through a custom service. I have three more pairs at home and take out a new one when I wear one out. Then I thought I should save them. If I keep all the shoes with their soles falling apart, there could come a time when I'm famous and say that these were the shoes that got me there. But I chucked them all, and this one's brand new. It's these shoes right here. And do we move like this? Let's sync one gesture and move on. So you mean, at the "ha, ha!" From here, we are going like this. Going like this, and at "ha," we do this. Guys! Let's just do the concert like we usually do. Don't switch it up for the concert. All right. He said not to decide on new gestures but you keep making things! And then let's go like this! It's okay to do some moves off-beat. - You guys are over the top. - All right. There may be differences in personality or opinion. But we're both focused on the same direction, so we hear out each other's ideas. - I want it to have a more "uncle" vibe. - Right, so at the beginning... Yes, something like being relaxed and dancing to your own flow. Yes, like that. - So you mean, more like... - Let's go more like a middle-aged guy. - Make it more seasoned, right? - Yes, like that. It's like a medium rare now, so let's make it well done. We're frank about what doesn't work and explain why we think that. That's how we push forward as a team. At first, I couldn't reach out for help. I used to just struggle on my own until it got resolved. And I'd have a breakdown. But by repeating that, I realized I needed to look to others for advice. That's good. That has helped each of us to learn and grow. - Let's go from the dance break. - Wait a minute. - I want you to match my pace. - Okay. Let's be detailed about this. Let's try it again. ♪ Everybody, dance! ♪ [Just Breathe] Shall we do this? Wow, what a big crowd! Now, let's hear you scream! Let's get right down to it! Everybody, there's more coming up, so stay standing. - Let's all run backstage! - Run! Let's run back! Thank you! That was great! When it comes to dancing, I focus on controlling my body. And think about how to maximize performance with minimal effort. There is so much to bring to the stage in our unit performance. The dance requires lots of practice, but it comes naturally when the music plays. As someone singing and dancing together, it makes me focus on great control of my body to keep a steady voice. Even as I gasp for air, I have to suppress that and sing. Those are the things that I have on my mind. But these are only on my mind when I'm practicing. On stage, I just perform with nothing on my mind. And I think that's how it should be. You've got the weight down, but there's not enough speed. Right, the moves aren't sharp. My hips won't move up for this gesture. - You have to have more tension in your hand when you do this. - I don't know how. And in this part, too. Make it more definite. Your arms are hanging like a pig's feet. The beat is... - The pig's feet dance is my specialty. - You have to maintain tension. - Also, this part, too. - Are we going from the beginning again? Don't be too honest with your move. You have to be like you're holding something inside. He has all my respect as a dancer, so I follow his guidance. I've admired his style since we were trainees, and I'd like to blend it with my style to make it my own. So when I can't make a certain move, I ask him for pointers and try to learn. That's how it's always been and probably will continue to be. I try my best to give San-ha pointers, and he's able to keep up with me. It seems he wants me to lead. Hello, we meet again. You're working so hard. Aren't you tired right after the showcase? It's okay. It has to be done. Luckily, I took a shower, so I feel refreshed. I rushed over without even drying my hair. There's much to do, so let's get to work. Since it's the same in the chorus, let's have San-ha learn and send him off first. Okay. - You can leave first after learning your part. - Okay. That's a great idea. You also need to learn it because he's doing what you'll be doing. - Then he can wait until after my part. - Sure, we can do that. Or leave early, if you dare. Whose younger brother do you want to be? Cha Eun-woo or Moonbin? Gosh, that's hard to answer. If I pick Eun-woo, Moonbin will get upset. But if I choose Moonbin, Eun-woo doesn't seem to get upset. So I'll pick Moonbin since he is easily sulky. I think he'll get salty over this interview. I think so too, but I can't do anything about it. Split your legs, and go one, two, three. Six, seven, eight. One, two, and last. Six, seven, eight. One, two, three, and four. - Have you got it down? - One, two, and... - Am I supposed to look this way after that? - It goes one and two. One and two and... Now I'm starting to get confused. One and two, and one and two. Wait, now I'm even more confused! Let's break it down one by one. Do we go this way first? Yes, go like this. You need to push your shoulder down. Two more times! - We're supposed to do this. - You're right. - Not this? - You move your arm in from out here. Two more times! Two more times! You just stretch your arms to the front and slide one back. This repeats so much! We've done this single move more than ten times! MJ and I haven't done a unit performance. So when I was asked to sing MJ's trot single, I guess our staff expected me to refuse. But I liked the idea. After considering who I should sing with, San-ha was also up for it. When they asked me to join, I thought it would be fun for our concert. That's how this came true. I forgot! You know that feeling when you hide behind a door to surprise someone and wonder how they will react? Hello, everyone! Dong-min is here! It was a surprise to everyone. It was a success. San-ha is in the house! First off, I feel so lucky to have met my members. I always say that. As the youngest member, I try to be well-behaved. I joke around with them. They frown at times, but I think they like it. I could be wrong. We've been together almost ten years if you count our time together as trainees. They got me back on track if I got into any trouble. Even after our debut, they have always been my anchors. They always kept me grounded, and I'm so grateful. There are many things I feel sorry for San-ha. He's our youngest, but he has his own troubles. But I... I never reached out first to him to provide comfort when I should have. I'm only now starting to work up the courage to do so. I know it's a bit late, but I'll reach out more and listen to San-ha's troubles. That's what I have in mind. San-ha, I know it's quite late. But from now on, I'll reach out to you first to talk more, and I'll strive to be someone you can depend on. Keep up the good work, and always take care of yourself. - Maybe say, "I love you?" - I love you! Did I sound like an AI robot? I'll say always. I always felt it that way, even during our practice. If MJ were here, the mood would've been more cheerful. And he would have made things happier. And whenever his part of the song comes up, I wonder how he's doing. When he first enlisted, it didn't really hit me. We always introduced him as "a happy virus" because he brightens the mood. But now, I realize how great an impact he was making on our work. MJ's presence is greatly missed. Especially when I saw his video clip, I missed him a lot. We're not a big group; there are only six of us. So being a member short has a big impact. I felt like a big part was missing. When I think of MJ... He's a very lovely person. He's very sweet, and he makes everyone around him happy. That's what I miss a lot about him. The main vocalist is the voice of the group. That's something I've come to realize with him away. One minute and ten seconds remaining. Watch your head. One minute remaining. - Members, please be on standby. - I need to move behind JinJin. - Does anyone need a towel? - I'm okay. Forty seconds remaining. - San-ha, do you need a towel? - No, I'm okay. - Are you sure? - If I wipe, my makeup gets smudged. Thirty seconds remaining. Yes, we're counting down. Twenty seconds remaining. Ten seconds remaining. My dream is... Even long after in the future... I want my members to have no regrets when this team is over. There have been many changes. A lot has changed for sure. When we first debuted, I was terrified for nothing. I thought a lot about what was right. Not to lose myself and get hurt less, I thought I needed to care more for myself. My biggest concern is the time when I'm away from the team. I'm worried but also excited about what stories will unfold. We should rely on each other more and think about each other a lot. There are concerns that we each have. After three or five years from now, I hope the concerns we have then will be about something new. My solo performance? It's perfect. Just kidding. I'm sure it'll be great. It's not perfect yet, but it's coming together. So there's no problem. You can look forward to it. At this time, Rocky is on the main stage. - And the female dancer will be at the... - She'll be on the main stage as well. - She'll be on the thrust stage. - You're right. - You'll be quite far apart. - Okay. "Scene #1" is a song with a medium tempo. I wanted it to be a straightforward performance so that it would be easy for the audience to understand. I wanted the song to be shown like a movie. The most ordinary sunlight. Wind. Temperature. Texture. And the noise. Today was no different day than any other day. And it was our love's... first scene. Okay, one, two, three. [Chowon Photo Studio] I'm going to forget you as well, so go and find someone else. - When did you get promoted so much? - I have connections. - You were the son of the company owner! - Yes, that's right. - I knew it! - Yes, that's the vibe. I wanted to make it a comfortable stage with that song like I'm a real office worker. So I didn't want to dance that much on stage to give the reality feeling. That freed us up to consider many options, so we ended up using a lot of props. "JinJin, All Day, Leader." You put it in like this, and you can shoot. It shoots out well! It says that it's our third concert, and it says "Leader" on either side. I'm going to shoot this fake money during my song "All Day" performance. Isn't this the fun part of concerts? I shoot these out, and the fans can have something to take home. I'll put on a great performance. Fighting! Why do you have so many props? There's not much for me to do, and I just use the stage devices. You dance once for the chorus. - Then you get back on the lift. - And I shoot money. The design came out really cute. - Your money? - Yes. Can I pay for things with it? - If you bring that to me... - Will you exchange it for real cash? The exchange rate is... I can't make any guarantees. - I can't say anything because the camera's rolling. - Will you exchange it for real cash? - I can't even joke about it. - Answer me. "Yes, thank you." What if our fans use it to pay at a restaurant? "This person in the photo will come later to pay." Then I'll have to go to the restaurant to pay. I'll smile and ask for forgiveness from the restaurant owner. I have to actually have fun to look like I'm having fun. I want my life to be all about living it up. That's how much it matters to me. Are you ready to have some fun? Wait, let me take out my in-ear monitor. Let's hear you scream! One more time, make some noise! - Aren't we using a lift here? - There is a lift. - Then is the bar behind? - Yes, the bar's at the back. I worked on it with the stage director. Creating a bar-like atmosphere was also discussed with him. Also, in the part where I walked out to the thrust stage, we talked a lot about how to improve. Are you tired? I can't say that I'm not. The concert is tomorrow... I hope we can do well. How does it look from off-stage? - They want you on stage once again. - Yes, okay. - Are you okay with that? - Yes. I'm curious about how this movie is going to turn out. You're always filming me when I'm so disheveled. Can I get some water? Wait, stop here. Let's do this part again. Let's stop and work out the details. With those steps, we need the lights, Lighting Director. Moonbin, are you going to take exactly three steps? - Yes. - Okay, let's turn on the lights for each step. From the side, top right, and from below. - All right, where is the starting point? - It's around here. Can you stand right there if we mark it for you? One second. - Yes, I think so. - We'll turn all the lights off when you stand there. Lights out after "anywhere." It's break time. Am I coming out okay on the camera? That's good. Our fans now know. I grow out the fingernails on my right hand when I have a guitar performance to pluck the strings. And our fans noticed that I was growing my right-hand fingernails, so they predicted that I would play the guitar. They're correct. Since all the members have solo performances, I tried to make mine a bit different. I wanted to make my own style of solo performance. And that meant playing the guitar. It's what defines my style, so I thought I'd give it a try. I played the guitar at our first concert. I even played it for my first solo stage, and I'm playing it now. I intend to keep up this concept. It's absolutely not because dancing is hard. This is just my style. Do you have any calluses on your fingers? Yes, I have a lot. But you probably can't see them through the camera. Maybe you can see them up close. Can you see them? You can see them, right? One, two. All together. Let's sing together! One more time, let's go. There's not much time left until the concert. I want to express the pure first love feeling because everyone can relate to it. I hope everyone responds to the stage. I'm not sure about putting this gesture in a dance. - Do you want to change your gesture personally? - I meant I'm personally not fond of it. Isn't this gesture really cheesy? I love it. - You can switch it up. - Let's ask others. - How about doing this? - What about this one? - First love. - That also makes sense. - I prefer this over the heart. - Then let's do this. - Love, love... - You can each decide. - What are we doing here? - Put your hands like this. But I think you can't see this from the third floor. Right? I think you can't even see it from the first floor. Number one, hand on the chest. Number two is the L gesture. And number three is a half heart. L and V. - Like this? - Yes, it's L and V. Okay, let's try with this one. Six, seven, eight. - Let's go with this. - Okay. It's the most straightforward for everyone to understand. This also looks like a V. How are we doing it? Are you going to fix the angle for everyone? That's right. Since it's about first love, I wanted to express the young and fresh feeling of first love. Love. That's what I had in mind. I'll go in after that. - Is that how you're going to do it? - Yes. You make the call. - I get nervous on the kinetic stage. - Are you a rookie? It still makes me nervous. I suggested that we wear school uniforms because I wanted that nostalgic vibe from when I was younger. You know, how it used to have telephone booths and benches in front of the playground. Hello? AROHA? AROHA... Are you ready? What does ASTRO mean to me? It's like a great discovery. There was nothing special about me. But ASTRO became my wings and shoes, and gave me the strength to move forward. ASTRO is a gift... And a teacher to me. It's because after meeting my members, I've received much love and happiness from others, and I think it's all thanks to my members. When I think about my life... ASTRO is all that defines me. It made me who I am today. A university. ASTRO is my university. We've worked and struggled as a team. There have been achievements, and we argue at times. ASTRO means everything to me. We've been together since we were kids. And that's the best part that we have each other who share experiences together. I think that's precious. They are precious in my heart. I know this will sound cliché, but they are really stars to me. ASTRO means "star" in Spanish. The moment I answered your question, I felt like someday, when I look up at the sky and the stars... ASTRO will be a star that I'll never forget until my dying day. Let's go. All together! Let me one, two, three! All together. Let me one, two, three! All right. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Let's shout out, "I love you!" - Let's go! Are you ready to have some fun together? Everybody, get up! Everyone, jump! Let's sing together! It's the moment I dread the most. It feels so empty. We're in a world of our own just a few hours earlier. But it's like waking from a dream. I try to hold onto it for as long as I can. My feelings after a concert are complicated. There is nothing left after all those cheers. It makes me feel empty. I don't remember much after it ends. So I thought about why I didn't remember anything. And I think it's because I give my everything on the stage. I don't remember a thing. To be honest... Because I'm doing so many things at once, it just made me feel like, "Phew!" There is a feeling of emptiness. I realize how quiet it gets. After standing before so many fans, suddenly, I found myself alone. Everybody! Is the movie over? - The movie is nearly over. - Is it? - ASTRO's journey over the past few days. - No, don't end! It's coming to an end. - Did you enjoy watching it? - Yes! Bye! Take care! Goodbye! Get home safe! Goodbye! I love you! In ten years... I think I'll have improved traits about myself that I'm currently working on. And by figuring all that out, I hope to be an MJ who has learned and grown. To Dong-min... Eun-woo, ten years from now. I hope you love yourself more. Work hard, but also play hard. And I hope you stay amazing. I'll see you then. To JinJin, ten years from now. I have so many questions, but I hope you're happy and doing well. Have you achieved your goals and worked through your worries? I hope that you have. Are you happy now? I'm happy to hear that. Do what you think is right, and don't lose conviction. It seems like you're happy. Keep it up, so you can stay happy. Yes. You got this! To San-ha, who is now 33 years old... Are you happy? Oh no, it's doomed. Why are you filming this? How can you film this? When I'm happy... When I'm happy... What do I do when I'm happy? When I'm happy... I thank others. I brag about it to my members. I can't hide it. I roll down the window. I try to remember it. I try to remember that moment. Because happy moments are never guaranteed. Are you filming the whole concert preparation process? Is it like a documentary? You started filming us at the studio. Are you coming to the concert? Are we doing interviews as well? When are we doing that? An hour and forty minutes? That's a lot of editing. Do you have enough footage? We have some. I wonder how it'll turn out. - It's a massage chair! - He's not torturing him. - That hurts. - You're going to make him cry. You're still so handsome. Oh, yes. Is that fried chicken delivery? Mild Eun-woo vs. Spicy Eun-woo? Am I fried chicken? I need to secure more screen time for myself. I need to come out a lot. I'm in the movie. Am I on the camera? Be sure to use this clip. Wanna be your star, ASTRO! Thank you! Let's do that hand in hand. You say, "Wanna be your star, ASTRO!" Then bow! Thank you, everyone! [Special thanks to AROHA]
