- Hi. Oh my. - Alma? - What? - Did you take your medication? - Really? - What? - You're fucking kidding me, that's what you're fucking thinking? - What, baby I'm sorry. Come back to bed. Fuck me. Alma, please, it was just a question can you come back to bed, please? - I can't, I can't do this anymore. You should leave, you should actually move on with your life. - Are you kidding me? Do you know how stupid that sounds? Can you not do this again, please? - Eddie, I'm doing this for you, okay? I am protecting you. I am not good for you. - After all we've been through, can you just tell me what you need? - You know what I need, I need to fucking feel, Eddie. I am done with the therapy, the medication, I am fucking done with it. I can't do it anymore, I just can't, I can't. I feel like I'm in a constancy state of sleep and I don't know what's fucking reality anymore! - You know what reality is? This is reality, I'm here and I'm trying to help you. - I don't need your fucking help, Eddie. I don't need your fucking help! Like, what don't you understand, everyone that I love, I fucking lose, I'm a fucking curse. You know, actually, you should fucking just get the fuck out of here! - What are you trying to do? - Go, get the fuck out of here! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you trying to do right now, are trying to push me away? - Just get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here! - What are you doing? - Eddie, just go! - Is this what you need? - Get out! - Is this what you need? - Get out! - Is this what you need? Are you trying to hurt the only person that's trying to help you? - The only person - You, you, you, that loves you? you, you love me! You wanna help me! It's not about you you fucking fuck! - Okay, Alma, please calm down. You're having an episode. Please, calm down. Please. - Don't fucking touch me. Do you even understand what it's like to live like me? Do you understand what it's like to be in my shoes and hurt people all the time? Do you know what that's like? I feel like I'm stuck in an abstract painting for eternity and I can't fucking get out! I don't know how to help me! I don't know how to fix me, Eddie! I hurt people, I do! I don't know how to fucking help me, Eddie. - Hey. We should get out of here. You and me alone, let's just go somewhere. - You don't me, Eddie, you don't. - Maybe I do. Let's go on a trip. What about Europe, I mean, we have the money. - Really, now? I'm not taking his fucking money. - Oh, okay. I'm sorry I mentioned it. - My god. - I'm sorry I mentioned it. Go to the lake house. You were always telling me how much it meant to you as a kid and how happy you were there. I never even been there. - I don't know, I, that might be too much for me to handle right now, I don't know. I don't think I could do that. It's so weird, I never think about my parents' car accident, not even on the anniversary. It's like they never existed. But Grandpa's death has just been so. - You were only seven when your parents died and Dante raised you. Your parents are now just a distant memory. - I miss him so much but Eddie, he's been fantastic through this whole process. He's put up with so much shit and so much madness. I don't know how he's still around. - Let's try to focus on you now. Are the new meds working? - Better than the ones before, less anxiety, no visions. - Are you having any paranoid thoughts? - Not as bad but not zero. I just really wanna get the fuck off all this shit, you know? But Eddie would rather have me sane than horny. - Did he sell any paintings at the fair? - Yeah, he sold one. I mean, the booth cost more than the painting but you know, now he's working at the gallery and I'm hoping they'll give him a show. - I saw the article on the foundation. Your grandfather would be so proud of the work that you're doing. - Yeah, I hope so. I mean, all he really cared about was giving his millions to the less fortunate. - I understand that, I do but you don't really have to feel guilty about living a little. - I know but I do. But I've been thinking if we try to get pregnant again we should be more generous with myself and Eddie. - I actually think it's a great idea. - I think so too. I mean, I think it'll good for the both of us. ♪ The rain fall harder ♪ ♪ You make the room spin round ♪ ♪ I'd like to sit real still ♪ ♪ We've built our house no sand ♪ ♪ You feed your baby water ♪ - Alma? - Yeah, I'm here. - You took your pill today, right? - This morning. - I picked up a prescription yesterday from the super weird pharmacist by the way. And he said to take these with tons of water twice a day, don't forget please. - It's just so weird coming up here again. I want it to be so much fun, you know and I feel like the closer we get the more anxiety. - Hey, stop, it's gonna be great, I promise. A weekend to remember. We should relax, have fun, you know, get the juices flowing again. - Is that what you want, you want my juices? - What, no, do you really think I wanna have sex with my insignificant wife? That's nuts, you're sick. - I may be sick but we definitely have something I love you. - I love you too. And you've been dealing with a lot lately, I think you deserve to have some fun. - What the fuck is wrong with me? - Nothing's wrong with you, that you know, a few pills a day can't fix. - I've been talking to Natalie about the idea of trying to have a baby. What do you think? - I don't know. Last time you were pregnant, it was so brutal. - I know, I know but these new meds are really making a huge difference. - Fuck it, let's have a baby. - Yeah? - You know what that means, right? - Sex. That's what I've heard and. Lots of it. - Well, if that's what it takes then count me in. - You can start right now. Is that for us? Where the hell did he come from? This is all I fucking need this weekend. - Do you have an emergency here sir? - No, no officer. - License and registration please. - Sure, just curious why we're being pulled over in the middle of nowhere. - Here in Oregon we got laws, son. I got you 20 over the speed limit. - Sheriff Johnson? - Is that my little Alma? - Not so little anymore. - What a great surprise. God, it's been years since I seen you. Say, is this your boyfriend? - No, this is my husband, Eddie. - Looks like trouble to me. - Well, he's a painter, an artist. - No kidding, I've been trying to paint landscapes myself. - Couldn't pick a more perfect place. - How long you all planning to staying for? - Just the weekend. - Hey, Alma, I remember you loved my grilling, how about I bring up a couple of steaks and your. - Maybe next time, we just, we really don't have a lot of time and we're were just hoping to just spend it, you know? - Say no more, honeymoon stuff, I get it. I'm gonna let you off with a warning this time. Now listen, when it gets raining, these roads get slick and I don't wanna get that bad call something terrible happened, you understand me? - Loud and clear and thank you, Sheriff, really, thank you. - You all be safe. - What the hell? You didn't tell me you knew the sheriff. - Yeah, he was a good friend of my grandpa, why? - I just don't like cops, that's all. I'm really glad we came. - Me too. - Come on, let's go inside, it's getting dark. Wow, this is so beautiful. - It's exactly how I remember. I remember he used to sit here all night reading. - He must have been really happy here. You seem calm and relaxed. - I am, I feel good, better than I expected. - How about I check out the generator and make sure we have enough fuel to last us the night. - How do you know there's a generator? - I just assumed all these must have one. There is one right? - Yeah, I'm just testing you to see if you're awake, shed out back. - All right. Be right back. Alma? Alma, I'm in the back, can you come out? - What's wrong? - What is all this stuff? - That's my grandfather's hunting gear. I once saw him kill a deer with a single arrow. - You never told me that. - Well, now you know. - You know how to use all this stuff? - No, I don't think I can kill or even hurt an animal. - Let's get our stuff inside. Maybe we can go for walk by the lake before it starts to rain. - What's that? - This right here is a shotgun. - And where the fuck did you get that? - Charlie, he said we would be crazy coming up here without something to protect ourselves. You know how many movies he watches. - Have you ever even shot a gun, John McClane? - Yeah, I mean, just point at what you wanna kill. Pull the trigger. Can't be that hard. - Okay. - Can you help with this please? - We're definitely gonna die out here. - Come on, it's heavy. There we go. All right, let's go. - I used to walk this path all the time. I just love how it never changes here. - Why didn't your grandpa ever bring you up here? - I don't know, I think he just liked to come alone or with me when I was younger. - I know he thought I was a loser. - No, don't say that, you're extremely talented. He just never understood what being an artist meant. And when we got married a year before he died, he really got to really know you. - Well, at least you knew me. - Oh god. - I think there's someone in the living room. - What? - There's someone in the house, get dressed. - I'm just getting all horny. - makes me so horny. - You're always horny, come on. - Oh my god. - Get that thing out of my face. - Who the fuck are you? - Who the fuck am I, who the fuck are you? - I own this place. - What, well, then where the fuck is Jack? - I don't know who Jack is. - I'll tell you who Jack is, Jack is the guy who's been renting me this fucking place for the last three fucking years. - Yeah, we stayed here for like a month for our anniversary. - Oh, my god. I've heard of these scams. They find some empty house, pretend like the own it and rent it out. - Oh, you gotta be shitting me, that piece of shit. I paid that scumbag three grand. - No, it's okay, baby, just relax, okay? - It's okay, we've been driving five hours, honey, what are we gonna do, drive back? - I don't know, we'll find a hotel or something. - Yeah, first I'm gonna find that bitchface weatherman who said it was gonna be 60 and sunny all weekend. Then I'm gonna find that piece of shit Jack and I'm gonna throw him in front of a fucking train. - It's okay, just relax, okay? - Relax, baby? - We'll figure something out. - What are we gonna do babe, sleep in the truck? - Yeah we'll sleep in the truck. - We just got here, honey, we have $30 in gas. - I know, I'm pregnant, - I know you are babe, and just please rest, Paul. I'm here honey, I'm here, I'm here, I'm trying, okay? - Excuse me, we do have a second bedroom and we could make a bed for you if you really need to stay the night? - Oh. - Can you excuse us for a second? Can we just? This was supposed to be our weekend alone. - Yeah, I know. - You know, our healing weekend. - Yes, I know. - And there's something about them that's real peculiar. This guy has like major anger issues. - I don't think they're that weird. Maybe little bit pissed off, you know, I don't even blame them. They drove all this way. Where are they gonna go and she's pregnant? - Yeah, but I was just starting to relax and I don't wanna have to share my place with strangers. I'd rather just go home and let them have the place. - No, that's ridiculous. Listen, if they give us any trouble at all, I'll personally kick their ass out. Just one day. If you still feel uncomfortable tomorrow, we can just ask them to leave. - Okay. - Okay. - Fine. - I think you guys can stay. - Thank you, thank you so much. - The thought of driving back was seriously depressing me. There's not even a decent hotel around here. - Nothing. - I feel really bad about the gun, you know, and we feel really bad that you got jacked around. - By Jack. - Jacked around by Jack. - Well, he's a greedy fucker and he's gonna pay for this. - So many awful people. - My grandfather always said that money isn't the root of all evil, it's greed. - Hey, I like that, may I steal it? - Yeah, you can have it. - How about I get the rest of your stuff inside? - Sure, thanks. It's over there. - Thanks again, I really have to pee. - Oh, no, no, yeah, sure. - You know how us pregos are. - Yeah. - You know when you hold it for so long and then you finally go and it just kinda dribbles out, that was me. - More than we cared to know, honey. - How long have you guys been married for? - Three years. - Four years. - Married for three, dated for one, he always forgets which is totally insulting to me. - Sorry guys, I have to make a quick call. - Hey, baby, who do you have to call on Saturday? - Natalie, I told her I'd check in. - All right. - Okay. - Her therapist. - Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. - Hello? - Hey, it's me, can you talk? - What's wrong? - This couple just showed up out of nowhere and they said that they rent the house from this guy named Jack who scams them. There's something about these two guys that I just, I don't know, I don't like them. - Well, that happens, it's a real scam. - I know but my anxiety's starting to act up and I'm starting to get paranoid, it's just they're very Mickey and Mallory. - Why don't you just tell them to leave? - I did, well, I mean, I wanted to and she's pregnant but Eddie felt bad and decided to let them stay. Listen, I have no reception up here to get online, can you just look this girl up for me? - Okay, what's her name? - Sophia Floures. - Let me see if I can find anything, just really take deep breathes and stay calm. - Hello, hello? - Hello? - Oh god, you scared me. - Sorry, I just wanted to come here and enjoy the view. I forget how beautiful it is up here. - Yeah, it is. - Do you come here often? - When I was a kid and then I started dating, high school, college, then I got married. - Yeah. - Then I stopped coming, I just don't know why. - Well, you are a beautiful woman, Alma, and classy too, that's a nice combination. - Thank you. - I'm all fat, pregnant, disgusting. I'd say Eddie's a lucky guy married a rich, sexy wife. - How do you know I'm rich? - Lucky guess, that house you barely come to, fancy therapist that works on the weekends. You know, I think people should earn their way in life. They shouldn't be given anything they haven't worked for. - That's exactly how my grandfather used to be. I don't feel so well well. - Let's go see what that was. Whew, hell yeah, that was hot. - You guys scared the shit out of us. - Sorry baby, we're just having some fun. - You ever shot a shotgun, Alma, it's a bit orgasmic. - A bit orgasmic, huh? - Totally. - You're right, it is orgasmic. - You never told me you shot a gun before. - I never told you a lot of things. - Where'd you learn that little trick? - My grandfather used to love hunting. - Oh, yeah, that's right, man, you gotta check this shit out. - Oh, look at all this shit. - We have to go hunting. - Hunting, I don't think I can hurt an animal. - I've done some hunting. I can show you guys how a pro kills his prey. - Come on, Alma, back me up. - I'm in. - Wait, you guys are serious? - What's the matter, Eddie, you don't like to get your hands dirty? - It doesn't seem like it. - Don't forget that. - How could I, I have you to remind me. - It's what I'm here for. Let's go, it's gonna be fun. - Let's make a toast. Alma, why don't you say something? - If you choose money over love, you will always be poor. - Her grandfather's favorite quote. - Oh, to love. - To money. - To her grandpa. - Hey, there are you okay, you all right? - Now, you're gonna tell me who you really are, what the fuck you are really doing here. - What the fuck? - Don't give me that Jack bullshit because I'm not fucking buying it. - Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? - It's kinda crazy, you look very nervous with that gun, just put it down onto the ground. - They're lying Eddie, they're fucking lying Eddie! - What the fuck? - Where the fuck is she going? - What the fuck is wrong with you, what the fuck is wrong is you? What the fuck? - What'd you do now? - Are you baby? insane! How could you do this? Baby, it's okay. - This is. I'm sorry, I didn't know! - Hey baby. - I'm so sorry. - How could you fucking do this, are you fucking crazy! - There she is. - Sweetie, are you okay? We didn't wanna wake you up. - What happened? - You came back with Sophia after your call, you said you didn't feel well, had to go for a rest. Are you hungry? - I just had the weirdest nightmare, it was just so real. - What was it? - You all went hunting, I had the shotgun and you guys were wearing weird masks. - Hunting, I don't think I can kill an animal. - I've done some hunting. One day I'll shoot a guy's head and kill prey. - Yeah baby. - Then I shot Sophia in the stomach. You guys started screaming, yelling at me and I woke up. - Okay, that sounds super creepy. Let's make a toast, yeah? Alma, why don't you say something. - If you choose money over love, you'll always be poor. - Her grandfather's favorite quote. - To love. - To money. - To Grandpa. - Really, that took forever. - Well, she's stronger than she looks. - Did you give her the pills? - Yeah, I put two in her wine. - I couldn't stand this belly anymore, I sweat my tits off with it. - Did you bring the stuff? - Yes, Eddie, I packed everything. - All right, let's get ready, I'm gonna get the stuff. - Come on, come on, pick up the fucking phone, Alma. - What was that thing she said about the masks? - Yeah, that was kinda weird. Are you sure she doesn't suspect anything? - No, look, it doesn't fucking matter, okay? - I can still see that old man's face in my nightmares. - It's been two years and you still have nightmares? - Fuck you, you weren't even there. - I was there. - Is it done? - It's done, let's go. Yeah, well waiting in the car while we come back is not exactly being there. You don't like to get your hands dirty, Eddie, admit that. - Right. - That's why I hired you guys. - Yeah and two years later, we're gas-lighting your wife still waiting for our money. - Yep, she screwed you out of your inheritance and then we tried to get her into a psych ward and there was another screw up that went nowhere. - Although, you know, unfortunate, totally unforeseen delay, as I've promised, I'll be doubling what I owe you once I take control of the trust. - $200,000 correct? - Why do you need to hear me say it again? - Because I like hearing what I'm selling my soul for and about to help kill your wife after I already drowned her grandpa. - You know, that deal doesn't sound so sweet anymore, honestly. - I could have paid a couple of gang bangers 10 G's each to do the same job with a lot less questions. - What the fuck? - Good luck finding some random gang bangers to do this job for you. - You know what, Sam, forget about it. We made a deal and we'll hold up our end as long as Eddie here holds up his end of the bargain. - Listen, this isn't just about making this look like some psychosomatic suicide, this is about the acting job that we are all gonna have to pull off tomorrow when the fucking cops show up. If that doesn't work, my end of the fucking deal will be the least of our fucking issues. - All right, you know what, calm down, Eddie. We're gonna get the job done, that's why we're here. - You fucking better. - Yeah, crazy. - You just kill him and get the fucking money. - Sam, grab that log there and put it under the tree. - There. - Sophia? - Yeah? - Take the rope and leave it on that branch. All we need is to get her a couple of inches off the ground. - Okay. Yee-ho cowboy. - Sam, take the rope and run it through her hands. All right, now tie it. Have her make a fist and grab it. Perfect. - Wow, you really did your research. - Yeah, I did. - You're one sicko. - Aren't we all? - The root of all evil isn't money, it's greed. - Thanks for that Sam. You two finish this, I'm gonna go have a drink. - That's why we're here. - Oh, we should have just drowned her like the old man. - Yep, it would have been a lot easier. On one, two, three. I got this one, go. Night-night. Congratulations Eddie, you are now a rich man. So what time do we make this call? - 6:30, we woke up she was gone. I woke you up, we looked everywhere, we went outside. - Yeah, she was depressed all day, having visions, acting weird, sleeping all day. - No one will question her state of mind. - They better not. Hey, baby, I'm down to get some rest. - Okay. - I love you, filthy bitch. - Okay, be in in a bit. So close I can smell the money. - Are you sure he's sleeping? - Yeah, just shut up and fuck me. - What the fuck? - Oh shit. Baby, it's not what it looks like, I swear. - It looks like you're fucking. - Sam come on. - Sophia. - Come on, Sam, take it easy. - Shut the fuck up, okay? Unless you want me to do to you what you paid me to do to your wife or worse her grandfather. - Come on, calm down for a second. - Baby, we were playing, it's just sex. - Listen to me, listen to me. Tell me the truth, tell me the fucking truth, okay, I can handle it but if you lie to me, it's gonna get very ugly very fast, okay? - Okay, baby, baby just calm down, okay? No, it's. - You twisted those pills into my drink too right? - No. - Was I next? - Absolutely not. - Was that your plan? - No. - Of course not baby. Of course not. Sam, calm down. - Listen to me, honey, honey, baby, tell me the truth, all right? - Okay. - How long have the two of you been fucking? - Just one time. - One year. - You've been banging for a year? - Yeah, I was lonely and I didn't think you'd care. I'm really sorry, baby, I'm sorry, I love you. Babe, I just. - I wanna believe you, I wanna believe you. - Hey, calm yourself down! - You shut the fuck up okay! - You and me are gonna make a fucking deal right now, right now. - What do you want, what do you want? - Half. Half of everything. - I will fucking join Alma on that noose before I give you half. - I'm not asking you. - Okay, I'll give you half. - He's fucking dead, he's fucking dead. Son of a bitch almost killed me! You saved my life. You saved my life, babe. - Of course, you're my meal ticket. - Fuck you. What do we do with him? - Easy, we pin it on Alma, say she went crazy and she axed poor Sam and then she committed suicide. - No, that would never work. Alma was a fucking nutcase but she wasn't violent. Suicide they'll buy in a heartbeat but this, this is just too much. - We'll cut him up into little pieces and feed him to the poor animals outside. - That's a good idea but that still leaves us with bones and a skull. - We'll burn the bastard. - It'll take way too long besides, cremations are done at almost 1500 degrees. You saw that rain outside, there's no way we can get a fire that hot. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. You know what we do, we take his body out to the lake, cut him up into little pieces, put it into garbage bags and just fucking sink him. - Fish food. - Yeah, you tell the cops you had a fight and he just fucking left. - We'll need to hide the truck. - Yeah, I'll pick it up next week. - It's gonna be a long night. - Just think about the money. Come on fucking help me with this shit, fuck. - Yeah. - Come on! I can't see. - Hi, this is Alma leave a message, thanks. - Alma, it's me, I'm on my way, I already contacted the local authorities. Please, please give me a call back once you get this. - Sheriff, do you copy we have a situation at 396 Lake Drive, are you around? - Damn, that's Alma's place. Dispatch, this is Sheriff Johnson, I'm on my way. - Find a tree stump will work. - Fucking heavy. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. - What, what? - We don't have anything to cut him open. - Oh. - Go to the shed, grab the ax or a saw, something sharp, okay? - Okay, here, keep this. Be right back. - What are you looking for? - Oh, my god, well, where have you been, we've been looking for you? - Really? - Fuck! - Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! - Sophia. - She's alive, we didn't kill her. - Alma, you're having a mental breakdown, a psychotic episode, please, we need to get you home! - This fucking car! - I should have just got a fucking divorce. Alma! Who are they gonna believe, huh? The one with a therapist and a psychiatrist? The one who's been on antipsychotic meds since she was a teenager? The one who thinks that we're all in a fucking dream! You killed that poor innocent couple and then in your delusion you tried to murder me! And it's not about money, Alma! This is about respect! The respect I deserve! I'm an artist for god's sake and instead of making me your husband, you made me your warden in our own little psych ward! That was our money, Alma, we inherited it! Fuck you!
