People and their colors: Walter Graf, bon vivant Erwin Lubowitz, criminal Julian, a young man * marching music * * The sound of the film is drowned out by the rattling of the S-Bahn. * * They play and sing "Kalinka". * * The train rattles over the rails. * * The rattling becomes quieter, the singing becomes audible again. * "The self-inflicted war left us in ruins. They determine the picture of our everyday life. Now, for the first time, a show of hairdressing by the hairdressers' guild will take place. It tells of the Berliners' unbroken desire for beauty." "Nice hair, carefully groomed. Aroused the admiration of young and old." Now! That's me, the hand! "The Berlin painter Prof. Hublocher is working again. A passport photo is sufficient for the artist as starting material. For whom is this young lady being portrayed? These oil paintings are valuable yet affordable. They too are testimony to the will to live of Berliners." The merchants Erwin Lubowitz and Walter Graf appear. Expelled to 1: by provisional identity card 1945. To 2: through driver's license from 1943 with photo. Explain those who appeared. They were not members of the NSDAP or one of its branches. The persons appearing set up a GmbH under the company Zentralimmobilien. Seat: Berlin. Purpose is trading in real estate. What is real estate? But life is full of changes, and death is part of it. Even if he comes uncalled and too early. And isn't that a consolation? If this man, husband and father died here in peace. Surrounded by those who love him. And that he finds his grave in the earth of his homeland. Hello, Bruno. * Someone knocks. * Are you the real estate agency? This is us. It, uh, it's a partially destroyed property. One twelfth of it is owned by Sweden. Maybe I just needed some information at first. The sheer details, my partner will take care of that. And it's not here now. I don't touch anything anymore in my old age. Why then? And this feeds you? It counts as an artistic activity, ration card 2. Could you give us some advice, Bruno. You know good advice is expensive. 10%. From how much? Of a great deal. * upbeat dance music * 1, 2, 3, 4 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Go away! You should come to supper. I'll be right there, get out! * The music ends. * Bye, Julian. Bye, boy. Bye. Are you coming down? No, I can't. It's not that far yet. # I was the hottest number in the bar. # And yet the coldest blond in the whole room. # And no one ever had me twice. # Until Paule came. # Until Paule came along and took me aside after a tango. May I ask you at the bar, he said. # And I felt a chill on my skin. # And that messed me up in the long run. # Before I knew the certain shame. # Until Paule came, until Paule came. # Which took my breath away at the first tango. I have to smoke one first. Fire? I have it myself. # Because the landlady was hammering on the wall. # Because she just couldn't imagine something like that. # But I was nothing but putty in his hands. # When Paule came. # When Paule came and took the last veil from my soul. True love is not disgusted by anything, he said. * Applause * We also have to dance with Tina. But who? I think you, I already have. * The music starts again. * may i ask I do not think so. I'm not dancing now You can lick your fingers. Cheers ladies, we are from humble backgrounds. Unfortunately, I can only drink schnapps. Good evening. Nice to have you here, Anita. Have a seat. Lubowitz and I founded a company. who is she Is a friend of Erwin's. *calm dance music* Who was that last night? a customer. I cut his hair. * The soldier unlocks the gun. * * A woman sings "Kalinka". * You got out by yourself? If they get him, let them get me too. And tomorrow morning, what are you doing there? I'm studying bricklaying. I also. So you can go. goodbye Does not have to be. Always keep something like that, something happens. Old work experience, sir. Poor Germany. If it's business and with me, then without women. Fine with me. From whom that came he fell. What was the name of your war comrade? Ottfried Kirchenhuber. This is his legacy. Walter came to me with this, I'll come to you. What's supposed to be in there? Money. Who is stealing money today? Today one steals Schrippen, diamonds, at least real assets. Now hold on tight, Bruno. This is the fare for all trains in Berlin. You'll get a few scraps for that. I want to know what's so important there. I'm not that closed. I once gave Lubowitz a tip, a villa in Spandau. Would still be possible. Something else. The basement next to it is unused. It's an Ade-Arnheim safe with a patrol all around. You can't get to it from the side. I could also get warm stuff. Do you know what that is, warm stuff? I don't want you to be part of this. What do you mean, take part? This is my project. I don't want you hanging out with these people all the time. I think we want to get out of here. I'll do it for you darling. And there is no woman behind it? You always have women in mind. I'll rent you a furnished room. What am I supposed to do with a married man? These are the most loyal, you'll figure it out. Here you go. Chesterfield 6 marks, rod 1,000. 800, not under 800. 800 with bag. Is this thing okay? Hm, pay the 800. Wait, that's only 700. Interested in liquor? No thank you. 750, 800. (Announcement) "Attention, attention! Police action is now taking place. Please keep quiet! Attention attention! Police action is now taking place. Please keep quiet!" I've been robbed, I mean cheated. Take off your hat. Why? Look! I'm not pushing, it was my father's device. Where is your father? Please. My girlfriend is approaching someone who has money. I have to keep up. But you won't get very far there. Would you recognize the one who dumped you? Even at night. You have a good memory for people. Come to us. You're always here anyway. Where do you stand politically? Never again war. That's something. So what's going on? They bet they would eat bread without drinking anything. * He's coughing. * Hundred. And 80 for the bread. I have no more. Then leave the watch here. I pay when I have money. When do you get money, what do you do? mason. And you no longer have an appetite? You can earn the money. What's that for? do you need to know I don't have to, I'm asking out of interest. Why is the sand so wet? groundwater, end of event. What's up, Bruno? Come on. What's up, bald 1 and bald 2? chat or work? I'm not stepping back on Tina. You're not her type. Why am I not your type? Did you see who she danced with? And how do you look? More accordingly. I have other options. We have 2 rooms and my grandmother is hard of hearing. You want to take advantage of that? That's supposed to be friendship? Then we are divorced people. Julian, come down. That's the one from the polenta. What else do they want from you? I haven't been around for a while so you don't wonder. I don't have time anyway. Also not for Bubi? I have other interests at the moment. No gentlemen visits. Make yourself comfortable, Tina. I'll go into the kitchen. Please. For the current month full price. A month in advance. Aha. And half a pound of coffee. Pretty Woman. Mm, but it smells. That's a decent girl. And I'm not a "master". Turn off the bed, Tina. Now? In the afternoon? Didn't you say I'm the first? do you wanna wait * He opens his pants. * * A clock strikes the half hour. * I'm afraid of the clock. * The clock is ticking. * *The clock strikes 4.* I imagined it differently. More beautiful? Getting prettier Tina. You will see. What is that? From before, a fairy tale. How can you cause me such trouble? How can you say morning exercise is fascism? That's theoretically weak. Fascism is the highest level of imperialism. Anyway the Nazis did morning exercise. Think what else they did. Right and left, spring, run, and right, spring, run. Well, I run voluntarily 10 laps every day. Voluntarily? Yes. And what else do you learn? How swirl patterns distinguish from fir patterns. These are fingerprint types. Glad you're learning. Good day. Are you coming, Bruno? I just can't get enough of it, Bruno, so much money! Money isn't what it used to be. That's why you have to have a lot of it. I would open a small pension , something solid, without hookers. We'd never have to touch anything again. you cheated on me I opened the closet and you secretly took something. Your ex-wife ratted us out for that. You rest in peace. That's why I'm sending them out now. It's been a long 4 years for you and for me. Otherwise you would have had to become a soldier. Why did we survive the war and jail? What if we don't move on now? * Someone is coming. * The money is collected, counted and taken away. But Wednesday and Thursday everything stays there. Because there is Friday wages. You open an office under your name in the same building. We would never have figured out what I'm telling you here. You always want to be so smart. With the cash My name is no longer Lubowitz. So what? I have other papers now. What's your name then? Why do you want to burden yourself with this, Bruno? But in your old files they will find my name. But the files are gone! I heard that differently. They left the Russians the files? It's always been like that. You need an alibi and nothing can be found on you. What kind of count is that? He was a Navy cook, actually he's a waiter. I still have my old drill. Of course I would know how to get there. But not for 10%. (porter) The cashier's room went as far as here. That wall is new. where is light Light is not, but electricity. I don't think the space is for rent. The door is not very secure. Would you steal something here? We don't steal at all. Excuse me. The checkout room has become shorter. But the vault underneath didn't get any shorter. Bruno saw that at a glance. That's an ass who cares but it's worth the money. Can't we at least put some chairs in here? Here? We're closing here. This is of no use now, it only does harm. * Brakes squeak. * You keep Anita out. I keep that completely out of the question. day, Willi. Day. Long time no see. What is the sport doing? I'm refereeing now. There's no such thing as your right hook anymore I adored him. Tell me, do you still have your cutting torch? For what reason? I'll be honest, for good friends of mine. They won't need him to light the fire. If I don't know and you don't know, what's it to us? I'll be out sometimes in the evenings now. There's no woman behind it, it's silly for me to say that. So if anyone should ask you, it doesn't matter who. Then you say that I was always at home. Even if you weren't here? - That's what it's about. And if anyone wants to know what we did at home, it doesn't matter who. Then you just tell me what we did. It's good, Bruno. So what are you saying? We played officer's skat. - What else? listened to the radio. - And also? Should I say that too, Bruno? One at the window. Yes please, you can do that. I can't stand that long. One starts, then you take turns. Stop! * Someone is walking by outside. * Continue. That's incredibly hard, Bruno. That shows we're right. That will not do. That's how it works, but it takes a few weeks. And then comes the specialist work. And you're the expert? I'm the expert. * Count continues to work. * There was still something to be done. No, I do not. You think things are crooked? - What do I know? I understand what you mean. But I have 2 basic rules. First, a human life is sacred. Second, never take anything from a poor person. No matter how life goes, most of the time it is unfair. But the world is set up that way. There is one major difference. A difference between work and activity. Work rarely pays off, activity always pays off. What I'm saying is, justice is your responsibility. Loading, securing, unloading. The firearm is primarily an instrument of threat of violence. And it's for extreme self-defense. You get 7 rounds of ammunition, each cartridge has to be accounted for. * Someone writes with a typewriter. * I am prepared for you to join us now. Your permanent place is at the side of your colleague Biegel. Your first investigation item is the oven. The ashes have to go. Right, comrade. # Because the landlady was hammering on the wall. # Because she just couldn't imagine something like that. # But I was nothing but putty in his hands. # When Paule came, when Paule came. # And took the last veil from my soul. see you at your place You're here too. Shall we drink champagne? Hello, my dear. Can I get out of your window ? Please. But why is this necessary? I have a problem with 2 women. Always these stupid girls. Would you like a cognac in passing? Why not? Do you live here? Just as long as I'm here. cheers my dear Cheers. That's not really my audience here. Do you trade with wheels? Who leaves the wheels on the wagon today? Oh, is that your car then? I have a tour license for Berlin and the Russian zone. Could you lend me the car? Who is lending their car these days? Then I buy it. Who is selling a car today? For a lot of money. There isn't that much money. Do you want me to come upstairs and see how you live? I'll have visitors. now? What is that hat? This is a gift, a model hat. There is only one in Berlin. Lucky. Do you know he's a burglar? * The radio is playing "Up from heaven, that's where I come from." * 24, against receipt. I'm going. Beautiful music. * He smells strained. * Did you break a bottle? Not that I know. How does Marxism relate to the German Christmas carol? waiting. Happy Holiday. (both) Happy Holidays. This is how we want to light up the Silent Night. * The radio is off. * Such nonsense that we're sitting here. The German perpetrator is resting at Christmas. Except for the suicides. * knocking noises * That's enough for today, you can't do that cold anymore. Well, the last time today. Come. Until now it was prison, from now on it will be a penitentiary. Why do you want to risk that? - Your gloves. You can keep these, it's cold. I'm not cold. Here's another ticket. Because it's Christmas. Cheers, to your health, happy holidays. Actually, he's too cute for me. I can only tell you, they won't let me get to it either. It can't last until morning every evening. Some things take time. Unless there's something sexual behind it. Certainly not. And anyway not with a woman like you. # (Radio) Rosamunde, give me your heart and say yes... 3 beers. Did you order these? Do I look like that? Good evening, Miss Graf. 3 beers. Thank you. You're done this morning. We've had the pleasure. My old friend Bruno Markward. pinske. Why not. We already had peppermint liqueur. May I order a layer for you? Not for me. * He digs out money. * i have family Wait a minute, Bruno. Is something wrong? I say my name myself when I want to. I've known Pinske for a long time. He gets us the warm stuff. He doesn't know why. You used to go to something like this alone. You used to have your own tools. Now we have a post-war situation. * The bells ring at midnight. * To the beautiful donor. Cheers. * The radio plays "Silent Night, Holy Night". * Isn't he a bit old for you too? # Holder boy in curly hair. # Sleep in heavenly peace'. Hands up! Actually, I should know what it is about. But when I trust, my dear, I trust completely. A new drill! It's half past one, Müller is coming at 1, at 2 and at 3. What is Müller doing here? you should drive I'd rather be here. Then take the crowbar. I'm through! Finished. * He coughs violently. * Should I? You've never opened anything. What I wanted I opened. Cigar boxes maybe. Alright, let's continue. Good. High again! Good. Without vest and vice versa. I can't pass. You made the hole yourself. I'm probably wider than I used to be or less flexible. Didn't you say he's a professional? What kind of people am I running into here? Won't you help me out? ow! And what's next? Gosh, if you screw this thing up for me. ow! One can only hope that the money is on the table. Shut up! There are only empty cupboards here. That's not possible. A closet is closed. Back in the corner. i need the flame Blue is oxygen, yellow is aze. Spin the wheels. plug in burns. The flame must be white. Now I'll start. Then let's pray. That was Mueller. I can't open the closet. Why not? I can't open the closet! Yes, but why not? I cut it, but it glued shut More oxygen, what melts you have to blow away. The burner has a quirk. Ah, you've got the quirk. I need a crowbar. If only I had stayed at home. He was always just a passenger and just watched. i see money Money is there. But the door is stuck. I can't reach it. Keep calm man we still have time. Shit, now the money's on fire. The money is burning, a spark flew in. do you have water Where is the water supposed to be here? You have to smother the fire. With what? Morning. - Morning. Not bad. What does it smell like? burnt paint. Again, this looks strange. Where should we start? Everything that needs to be done. The entrance, the closet, possible fingerprints, 3 overviews. First this. Unfortunately, this is your own shoe. Escheritz, I'm the head of the bank. These 3 gentlemen are the authorized locksmiths. Lotz, this is Detective Secretary Kollmorgen. Have you looked at everything? Right after I got the message. How bad is the damage? This is the income from 3 days. So, there are missing... 1,446,530 Reichsmarks. How much does the Sprat cost? 60. Oh! Hey, I'll take another one. 1 rope, 2 meat hooks. Various bills singed at the edges. A cigarette. Did the burglary take place here? I am Criminal Candidate Julian Kotte. When was the wall moved? - After the bomb damage. '43. - '43. Who knew about this? - Everyone who worked here. I mean part of the vault top was lying next to the bank. This could probably only be imagined by those who knew the map of the house. Who? - 2, 3 employees. Me too of course. Who are these employees? They left after the war. Would you make yourself available? - Of course. And she too. Well, in '45 the Russians were in there. You mean the Red Army. Yes indeed. One thing is weird. The breakthrough is absolutely professional. But below was a layman's turn. You mean crooks did it? Who else? A button. Very good, we have high hopes for that. Here. Pinske has to get something for the warm stuff. What does Mueller get? A little thing, my dear. The bricklayer, I think, is out. Why is Bruno getting so much? There are rules of the game. Please hold that. I've been with Deutsche Verkehrskreditbank since '26. So already under Hindenburg. - Yes. And did you stay under Hitler? There was nothing against me. And in '45 you moved on. Because there was nothing against me. Then pull out the laces and the belt. Now there's a case against you. Is Bruno there? Hm. How much? 400 times a thousand. I guess we were all a little nervous yesterday. * Bruno leaves. * Show no money, endure no women. Stay healthy Bruno. What kind of money is that, Bruno? He owed me. * A bird chirps merrily. * * Door bell * But I'm amazed. What gives me pleasure? What is written there? million robbery. What happened again? - Where is my husband? No idea. They do not know? - Where should I come from? It's his private business where your husband is. I want 100,000. I do not understand. - 100,000 marks. From me? You can get the money back from Walter Graf. Who I'm still married to. You will find him. You have a misconception about what you are alluding to. Unfortunately I am not involved. I've never seen so much money. I trade a bit with coffee, that's a long walk. Where is my husband? They never told me anything, not even where they are now. All the best to you then, Mr. Pinske. Hearing it again and admonished to the truth, I have an idea. Some time ago I showed 2 men the room at the credit bank. They might want to rent him. The men were known to me by sight. They maintained an office in the same house. I can't remember the names. Right? - Yes indeed. Good prospect for a small company. For me, the most important culprit is in the bank. If the railway workers in Berlin don't get their wages. Then I think about politics. Then you have to look for the backers, colleague. But the men in front may have looked out the window here. Nobody runs a company there where they intend to do something like that. In individual cases, the German perpetrator acts illogically. Lubowitz, Erwin. Do you have the address? Ah, wonderful. Thanks. There are 241 registered Grafs in the 4 Berlin sectors. 14 of them are named Walter. There are 5 Lubowitz names, one of which is called Erwin. That was up to the detection service. Erwin Lubowitz was born on September 4th, 1906 in Wustermark. Fraud in 2 cases, 7 burglaries. The criminal record? - That seems to be gone. But the address is there. Hands up, detectives! Herr Lubowitz no longer lives here. # And I felt a chill on my skin. # And that messed me up in the long run. # Before I knew the certain shame. # Until Paule came... Long time no see dude. I always wanted to come. Do you know where Tina lives now? Yes. But it's not what you think. I wanted to see Tina. Not now! * He rings. * Should I call the police? I'm the police. It's someone from the police! Do not let him in. I'll be right back. What then? are you the police Yes I am at the moment. You have to get used to it first. I have to ask you something, Tina. In Kaiser's ballroom, there were 3 men. I mean the one that was sitting to your right. do you know him I haven't seen him again. Do you know what it's called? Could it be called Lubowitz? I do not know. Why then? And the one you danced with is the count, Walter Graf? Is there a fingerprint on Tina's skin? Do you know where that is? I don't even know him. What was going on? He asked about your friend. Yes why? Didn't he say. (Landlady) Why are the police ringing here? It was an acquaintance who just wanted to know something. All right, all right. And then he asked about you. What did you say? That I don't even know you The familiar thing, did you just make that up? I don't have to, I know him from school. The police officer? He wasn't a police officer. It started there now. It might be a shitty world. * Door bell * What are you doing? There you are. Throw down the coat. So. And now the suitcase. That's my suitcase! You do as I say now, yes, throw down the suitcase! Why should I do what you say? It's my suitcase! It rings again. (landlady) How much longer will that go! I have to open now. * Door bell * They stole a lot of money. And now they're looking for them. You mustn't have anything to do with it. What, do you have the money? This is my suitcase. And where is the? It's gone. Shall we take something? You're not wearing anything. I was already asleep. We can't take anything from it. Julian is with the police. * The clock strikes. * We give Julian the suitcase. Then he'll be famous. That will not do. - Why not? Because I was there too, at the burglary. It wasn't the police. Where's the suitcase? Ah, so it's you. i want the suitcase But you won't get him. How much? How much do you want? No money. What else? Leave Tina alone. I'll do that, boy, on my word of honour. Any guarantee. Where's the suitcase? Wait a moment. Are you stealing cement here? No, no, there's only one suitcase in here. Aha. Yes. Oh I see. Yes. Give me the handcuffs. stand there Do I need the gun? Leave it. criminal police. Are you Mrs Graf? Yes. Is your husband's name Walter Graf? Yes. Close the door and show her your ID. Is that him? Yes. And where is he now? - I don't know that. Does he have a job? - I don't know that. He can't be in the Navy anymore. I'll take that with me, on loan. Do you have any other pictures? - No. We're bombed out. You can save yourself that. My husband hasn't been home since Christmas. well? Why not? My husband goes his own way. You know, I know stories like that. He has a girlfriend, but you don't know who. He's sleeping somewhere else, but you don't know where. And if he has a sack full of money under the bed. At least it's not your bed. You're sitting here between your hats, clueless. What are you doing there? But I only speak to a senior gentleman. Yes, a senior gentleman. And I myself remain incognito. *steps of a woman* * loud S-Bahn noise * * double gong * "You see for yourself." "You hear yourself." "Judge for yourself." I have a lead for you. I was promised that I would remain incognito. Yes, I don't want to know who you are. Just assume I'm a woman who has lost her ideals. Good, I suppose. She just met a man. can someone come here Yes, they sit in the front, yes, third row. How do you know? * Someone is coming. * Someone scoffed at me. It must have been for base reasons. You got the warm stuff. Warm stuff, what's that supposed to be? Long underwear? Lubowitz didn't need them, Lubowitz. I admitted that right away, I've known the man since the end of the war. But many know him. Where did the burner come from? Which burner? That Lubowitz used. What should he have used it for? Lubowitz is a small fish. The head in the background is you, Pinske. You let people work for you. Didn't even know what they were up to. Who was up to what? No, no, not like that with me. I am the victim of an accusation. I won't get involved. You're already involved up to your neck. Peppermint Tea. It could be that there was talk of a burner. Maybe I accidentally passed it on to a friend. But then I missed that. Because I often talk when I'm drinking. That's not wrong. Who was the acquaintance? And here's the verdict. Winner by knockout in the third round Meisenbrink, Blaue Hütte. I have something to report, I'm missing a magazine in my pistol. I took it out because of my little brother. Why don't you become a new teacher or something? Tell him to come out, his wife wants to see him. And if he says should she come in? No magazine, but objections. Then tell him there's a doctor here who wants to see him. Sport friend Schulze. Red corner... * The dialogue is incomprehensible. * are you the doctor - I wanted to take your pulse. I haven't touched him since. As you can see, experts weren't there. Anyone who borrows something is only in trouble. what's in here Where? In the box. Old Newspapers. Clear them out. Tied up as I am? That's okay. I saved that. Shouldn't my wife know. I didn't get any money. I was only a mediator and messenger. Maybe they wanted to compensate me later for my effort. I had to drink quite a few beers with Dombrowski. I don't think so. They were big egoists. I know people like that. I'm telling you. One was Lubowitz, we already had that. Was the other count's name? I would like to say that it is possible. Who else was there? I only saw him from afar. - What did he look like? snooty. young or old? - alt. No name on it or nickname? - No. All I know is that he was imaginary. How did you determine that from afar? Instinctively. May I bring up something else? Please. When I was summoned here, an animal stayed behind in my apartment. A canary. He's not cared for. Yes, there was a bird. Do you have relatives? just the bird. What happens in such cases? We once had a cat that was given to neighbors. The animal means everything to me, Inspector. Or as it was called in the time that is now historically behind us. I had a comrade, you won't find a better one. * Shop doorbell. * How long is he supposed to stay here? Not sure yet. That this day does not know the next. That happiness doesn't see the pain coming. That is wise and thoughtful. Hello, Mr. Markward. Bruno, we don't know anything. Let them kiss our ass. Why did you say, Bruno, we don't know anything? What did that mean, Mrs. Markward? I can't remember those words. Did your husband say we should all kiss our ass? I think so, I don't know exactly. There were 11,000 marks in your kitchen cupboard. where are they from My husband took care of money matters, he should say that. Stand up. They remembered the name Markward. is that the man I once saw this man with Mr. Lubowitz in a restaurant. Otherwise I don't know anything negative. Did you see the man too? - I missed that one. When did you last see Lubowitz? Around Christmas. Coincidentally? I drank a beer. And Lubowitz too? It must have been like that. In the sun"? May be. I always drink beer near where I get thirsty. Did you hear about the burglary in the Reichsbahn cash register? I think I read about that in the newspaper. Lubowitz made the break, and you were involved. Is that why I'm here, and my poor wife too? Gentlemen, gentlemen. I don't blame you. That you only now realized that there was nothing against me. I am always at your disposal. Good luck, in the interest of legal certainty. Not every class enemy is a box office enemy. Sit there and pay attention so you can learn something. So, let's familiarize ourselves with the legal situation. 243/2, Grand Theft. That's what you're looking for. On penitentiary up to 10 years can be seen. When stealing from a building or enclosed space. By burglary, boarding or vomiting of containers. Should you be trained with my help? Bruno Max Wilhelm Markward. Born on February 2nd, 1882 in Oppeln as the youngest of 7 children. Father Felix Markward sawmill worker. Mother Margarete Pach, nee Pachale, housewife. The parents later moved to Berlin. Is that Markward you? It can not be excluded. Mr Markward. We have your criminal file from the Berlin Superior Court here. Window burglary aged 17, no penalty noted. At 18, burglary in a basement, 4 months in prison in 1901. Now let me jump back to 1931. Safe burglary in a Protestant monastery in Potsdam. Together with Erwin Lubowitz. Negotiated only 10 years later. Based on a complaint by your former wife Helene. After you get divorced. 5 years in prison, broken off at the end of the war. You have a total of 16 criminal records. This is not news to me. Where did you get the 11,000 marks? I think it's supposed to be millions? I am employed on a humane atheist basis. Some people have 11,000 marks in their closets. I'll admit that occasionally I broker a ring or something. To American customers. I think that's honestly earned money. If you took it with you, I'm sure I'll sue for it to be returned. I'll tell you how it was, 2 different people welded. They weren't flexible enough anymore, were they? I think you tell how it was. Do I write what you say or what he says? Both! If you have my resume handy. Too bad, so much was burned in the war. Then I'll tell you something in confidence. I did this one thing with Lubowitz in Potsdam. That was enough for me. I wanted to teach him the warm work at the time. But he's too stupid to turn on the burner, the snot. Why the 11,000 marks in the closet? You're not a beginner. I have already explained that with the 11,000 marks. Nobody believes you. Your thing. You have something to prove to me. Excuse me if I explain the profession to you. I've already had champagne with Detective Inspector Lemke. If the name tells you anything. Some of you still ran barefoot after the music. Go next door. Go with. It's not going to be that way. Let's do it differently. face to the wall! * He whispers. * Turn around. What did you put in the bag? I already know what I'm doing. We don't hit. We are not. * A cuckoo calls. * You're a rich woman now, Anita. I have the money in the trunk, 400,000 marks. I thought you'd take it to Aunt Erna over to Paderborn. In the English zone. Good day, the IDs please. And sir, please. A married couple. Have a good trip. What was the name? - Count. * The car is started. * count? * The engine revs up. * Don't understand why they're already looking for me. Someone must have ratted me out. One condition. Loyalty. That's no problem for me. Anita! where are you sleeping at the moment Man, I'm on the run! sit down dude are you here privately Yes. How long have you been smoking cigars? Only occasionally, in the evening. Do you want to try? I would like to dance with Tina. May I sit? Please. It's your prison, I'm just a guest here. Please. In '43 I was also in Brandenburg. I was in the carpentry shop. - Me in the locksmith shop. Anyone who could do a trade got through better. That's the way it is. Was it actually worth it? I do not understand. Together they have been with you for over 20 years. Oh that's the point. You underestimate the split times. The times in between were life. My tailor was in London, my hat came from Paris. I was at the North Sea or in Heringsdorf until it got cold. And then straight on to the mountains or to Italy. It wasn't easy for my wife, I mean the girl at the time. Because she couldn't always join us. In terms of work, by the way, always without a weapon. Otherwise you just make yourself unhappy. The projects were offered to me, people came and needed advice. If I wanted to, I participated. I don't know if you were better off, you sat too. You for your reasons, nothing against politics, and I for mine. What were your split times like? Apparently they were worse. Markward, don't you want to talk? I talk all the time. It does happen that someone hides something at their place of work. But not here. Where should I start? You have to ask the worker detective Lotz where to start. How deep? Follow your criminal instincts. I consider what Lotz is asking of us to be amateur theatre. I would have let the woman out and kept watching. There is a system. And I would leave the previous wife alone. Rest gently. The German perpetrator usually has piety. * He bumps into something solid. * Dig here. It will probably continue like this. Have you been long with the police? I am. Or was I. Until the Nazis kicked me out. Why? Because I was in the wrong party. In which one? SPD. And Lotz? He was the KPD, they were never with the police. Good morning young lady. Maybe I'll dig next to the rock. I mean, if it were a bed, where the bedside table is. Any idea is better than none. Here's what. Made of sheet metal. a lid. If the gentlemen have no questions, I would have several. Turn to the window. Why? Just a moment. You can look again. gosh. Do you want to take a look? Not necessary. There are 410,575 Reichsmarks in it. Let's start at the back. Where's the rest of the money? Where Lubowitz is, there is the booty. Lubowitz brought me my share. What was the share for which work? I was only an adviser. Actually I advised against it. Because there were far too many people there. You had a car. I only went along for a short time. Who was the driver? I didn't know him. Before we go any further, think about it. We all get old, you already are. If you move in with no extenuating circumstance. Then you might never get out. That's the way it is. i pass Who drove the car? The man's name was Miller. You shouldn't screw us up! Why, the man's name was Müller and he drove an Opel. # But one fine day it was over. # Police in front of the door at four in the morning. # And in the stairwell my shriek was echoed. # When Paule came, when Paule came. # Which she took into custody with an 8. (singer) Take it slow, pussy, he said. # And only this shiver stays on my skin. # And that messed me up in the long run. # Strangers by the neck and they are all lame. # I imagine how Paule came. # And took me to heaven at the first tango. * The music fades away. * You don't have to come up with me. Are you here privately, dude? Not today. Do you want me to come down? I'd rather you go back. We're not going to fight, dude? You're not going to shoot, are you? I'm quitting again. * shop bell * The bird lives 2 years and 8 months. Have you heard from Bubi? No I haven't. I think that's far away. Everyone else is seated, except for Lubowitz. Could have worked with us too. Has not. What is this picture? A fairy tale from the past. Mr. Lubowitz? Lubowitz! stop, stop! What do you want from me? Lubowitz, I'm arresting you. What's going on here? I arrest this man. Can you ID yourself? The gun. where is the magazine The magazine? Who should be arrested anyway? My name is Schmidt. I'm arresting this man for bank robbery. The man cannot escape you. Now let's go to the station together. We thought You're long gone. What am I supposed to do? I'm from Berlin. * tango music * (Commentator) "The Berlin amateur dance couples determine their masters. And for the first time since the end of the war. What looks so easy requires long and intensive training. This elegant sport requires dedication. But it also brings a lot of joy. It is a beautiful testament to the will to live of Berliners."
