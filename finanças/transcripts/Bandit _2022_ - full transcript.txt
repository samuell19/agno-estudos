Come on, car's this way. My wife's rings, necklaces and bracelets, bastard even took my shotgun. So, where do we go from here? Oh, they steal here, they fence over in Vanier, they sell at another county or in the States. Recovery's low, okay, it's extremely low. Okay, it's extremely low. - It doesn't have to be. Detective Ray Hoffman, Vanier B and E. That's quite the super bush cut, buddy. Dress for the job you want. Been trying to get a hold of you for a few weeks. Give me a sec. Yeah, sure. They said you weren't much of a desk guy. So I thought I'd catch you in action. Sounds like you guys are having as much luck as we are. Yeah, well they keep cutting funding 'cause we're not delivering the numbers. Getting more pink slips now than convictions. Waiting on mine. How can I help you? 8,224 robberies nationwide. It's the most in the entire world. The Capital alone's seen B and E's double since last annum. Despite where our government says, we're not winning. I don't think I've ever heard anyone use the word annum out loud. It must be equally frustrating with our overlapping cases to not have access to one another's resources. Same perps moving in and out of our cities, same red tape covering both our departments. Understatement. So what are you saying you want join forces? We'll create a new one. Like a task force? Look, from what I found, there's three top fences for everything stolen, with the name that keeps coming across my desk is Tommy. - Tommy Kay. I know, I know. Down at The Playmate, I know, even this break-in right here has got all the Tommy hallmarks, guns and jewelry stolen and all the electronics left behind. - Both have higher resale. - Yeah. By my estimation, 70% of everything stolen moves through him. We bring him down it all falls. You you're gonna need more manpower, major funding and a fucking kick ass proposal. (people speaking indistinctly) (birds chirping) Elwood, I think we just got our mission from God. It's Hoffman. No, Elwood, Blues Brothers. You know, Belushi, Aykroyd... Okay, we'll work on that. (Gilbert laughing) - [Andrea] It's true. This is a nice neighborhood, right? What are you up to? What do you mean, what am I up to? Okay. - We're out for a walk. - Uh huh. Oh, I like this place. Whose place is this? Ours? What? (Gilbert laughing) What? No. [Gilbert] Yep. Wow. Yeah, well, come on, we don't have enough money to rent this. Who says we're renting? [Gilbert Voice over] All right, I know what you're thinking that new homeowner smile on my face is 'cause I must be rolling in it, right? Wrong. The average bank job only nets you about 20 grand. You know how fast you can burn through 20 Gs. Look no further than this house right here. New baby, new start, amazing things for an amazing woman. - Really? - Yep. What, how? Well I reconnected with my Pops out West and he hired me as a... (door knocking) Come on in. He hired me as a security analyst. So I'll be flying back and forth a lot, but I think it's worth it, right? What exactly are you doing? So I'll be going into businesses and assessing their weaknesses. Oh yeah, right over there boys, thank you, thank you. Yeah, so I go into companies and I help them. I teach them how to, you know, improve their security, prevent crime, things like that. Really? Yeah. Well when do I get to meet him? Well, you know, he doesn't really believe in the whole living together before marriage thing. He thinks we're sinners. He's kind of a commie that way. So when are we gonna get married? I'm just kidding, I'm kidding. (both laughing) Is this real wood? (telephone ringing) You're very fast when you look through it. I mean, 'cause it's a lot of work went into that. I'm just saying. Definitely well put together. It is, it is, yeah. And, and you know, these guys, they keep popping up like ants. So that gives us the resources that we need so we can tail them to their fences. I mean, we have to prove the source, right? I get that. It's just, there's not enough in the budget to fund this. We'll cut corners, okay. We have no issue with that. Even then. You don't have to pay us overtime. It's fine. Maybe if we had a bigger success rate ahead of time, this would be a lot easier sell to the boys upstairs. That's what's gonna give us the bigger rate and make you look even more like the rock star than you already are. Okay, okay, remember why we got into this, okay. Let's do that. And we can only do that if we do this. Okay, just pass it on. They say no, they say no, I don't bring it up again. If I pass this on, you'll leave? Up, up, up, up. - [Man] Promise? - Promise, see that right there. - [Man] You're gone? - Fucking rock star. (upbeat music) Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats. That's business 101, mutt.

(gentle music) Do you see that bank right over there? [Tommy] Yeah. I can get in and out in three minutes. And do what? Rob it. Bullshit. You wanna bet? If you need money, why can't you just steal it? Because I need more than the average haul and I don't wanna be knocking over every bank in the same town that I live. Three minutes. Three minutes, for 10,000 bucks. I'll pay it back, 20% over six months. 30% over five months. (dramatic music) Deal. Set your watch. Hey this is a Rolex pal. You got some balls, huh? Yeah, I got two. Hey, hey, don't come back in the front door, okay, okay. Okay. (dramatic music) Is this really happening? He's going to the loo. I guess he must be nervous. (laughing) That motherfucker. - Is this really happening? 50 bucks says he gets japped. Yeah, I'll take that money. (dramatic music) He's taking too long. Told you. [Gilbert] Fuck. (dramatic music) What the fuck? Fuck. There you go. Fuck, there's money in construction. [Gilbert] Happy New Year. You're late, three minutes and 12 seconds. Come on, you're busting my balls. Just the left one. Hey, sit down. How many times you've done this? Well, that would be my second. I've been casing it for a while though. You see in the States they got armed guards at every bank around the country. But in Canada, it's like John Candy with fucking mace. Could we get a drink? - Oh, Linda. - Yeah. Set us up with some Crown, please. Got it. Oh Dave, can I have a minute here? Thanks buddy. How many more of those do you think you can do, just like that? Well, I mean there's 5,890 branches across the country, so. Oh, so I guess, hey, we're gonna be having a lot of drinks. Hey, you got the money, I got the time buddy. I'm in.

I didn't always need him, but it was good to have powerful friends. Yeah baby. You like it? I love it. Good, because you got two more coming. Are you sure that's a good idea?

On the other side, you got the guy who stole the cash to build the house. I'll get you boys some drinks, all right. - Absolutely. - Thank you. Partners and rye, huh? [Gilbert] That's right. Boy, this ain't just business for you, you really like this shit. - I do. You know what the most exciting part is, when you're descending and your plane is at 10,000 feet and all you see is the world beneath you. You ever cased a bank at 10,000 feet? I've done a lot of things at 10,000 feet, my friend. But that ain't one of 'em. (both laughing) I'm going to count this. Is he okay? Yeah, Dave's a little overprotective. Overprotective of you? [Tommy] Yeah. Look at your hands, they're like lunch boxes. Oh yeah. I may only have an eighth grade education, but I got a doctor's thesis in street. Which reminds me, you keep doing what you're doing, the way you're doing 'em, you're gonna be in the Millionaires Club before you can say stick 'em up. Millionaires Club? Yeah. That's when you make a mill off just one job. You're never gonna get a million off a bank. Are you kidding me? Not a bank. What do you know about jewelry? What do I know about jewelry? I know that people are attached to it and it's riskier. I mean, money is money, it's got no characteristics, but diamonds and watches, that's personal. Yeah, which is why it's more lucrative. I don't know. Jewelry's like taking from the little guy. A bank is an institution. You don't take from the little guy. You'll break him, you'll send him to the poor house. What, are you kidding me? You ever walk into a God wins? These places are corporate. They're smaller than banks, less security. You do one job like that right, you can retire. You should think about it. It would have to be a long ways from here. You could always use your air miles. And if that fails, well, you got one of these. Oh, well I guess the size does matter. (both laughing) T. (upbeat music) Shit. Be right there, honey. Who's that? Ah, that's my daughter. You have a daughter. You never asked. [Tommy] Baby, you know you're not supposed to be in here. What happened, the school burn down? Come on, you're 16 years old, this is no place. Come here, this is no place for you. I've seen naked women before. [Tommy] I'm not even gonna ask. (upbeat music) (birds chirping) (people speaking indistinctly) I can tweak the report, lower the numbers, make it a budget they can get on board with. No point. So that's it, we just quit? (people speaking indistinctly) We got it? Oh, I mean, unless approved means something else. (both laughing) Look, I know I'm a bastard, all right. All right, look, I'm gonna need 20K cash so we can get all the fence shit we need. I want every single one of our boys in unmarked rent-a-wrecks and a big fucking state of the art home base. (both laughing) Well, I guess it beats the shitbox coffee shops, huh? So what are we calling it? (gentle upbeat music) OPD, RCMP, all top of their class. Can I get everyone's attention please? Hi guys, how you doing? I'm Detective Snydes, B and E, I'm not gonna give a big speech or your game day pep talk. But the fact is Project Cafe is your number one priority. Individually, you don't matter. Your families no longer matter. But know that if we catch our man, every single one of you goes home with credit for the collar. Understood? Any questions? Who exactly are we trying to collar, Sir? Tommy Kay. Moves more goods than fucking Simpson Sears down at The Playmate. Half the clientele being on his payroll makes that place fingerprint city. I wanna know every person, perp and prostitute that goes in and outta that place. (dramatic music) We know Tommy. Diamond Dave, his second in command. (door knocking) (door breaking) (dramatic music) Billy Bishop, junkie all around shit heel. But the last two pieces of the puzzle, what do we have on them? Working on it. Well, work harder. Get me everything you can on these two. Because ever since they showed up, we're seeing a lot less fencing going on down there. And I wanna know if they got something to do with all these bank jobs going down. 'Cause it's no coincidence. (dog barking) Oh shit. Yeah, all right, I asked around. Security analysts don't make this kind of cash, Robert. Well, the good ones do. Yeah, what about your business card? The telephone line is disconnected and the address doesn't even exist. What are you doing? [Gilbert] Look. Are you selling drugs? No. Are you killing people? No, of course I'm not killing people. Well, I'm running out of options here. Are you even working with your dad? My dad's been in the can since I was 10-years-old. The last time I saw him, he was getting dragged off the front lawn in handcuffs. I didn't tell you because I was embarrassed. And what about your mom? All that stuff about your mom, was that a lie too? No. No, no, that's the truth. Before my mom left, she would sit with me and my brother and she would just read to us. She was really big on that kind of stuff. She was super smart. Then after my dad got locked up, she, I don't know, she just checked out and she wasn't really around much anymore. She'd always say that, no matter how much I changed my clothes or my shirt, I would always, I'd always be him. Then what the hell is going on? What are you doing? Page one. You're inside trading? Lower on the page. Look, after I got outta jail, I met you and I wanted to start over. I wanted a home, I wanted a family. That's it. I'm sorry. This is you. Yeah. You're a robber? Yeah. How many have you done? I don't know, maybe 30 newspapers worth. 30? Maybe more. (gentle music) Look nobody's been hurt, except you. I'm gonna pack up my shit and I'll be out by tonight. I promise. So you're just robbing the banksters? Yeah. Show me. (gentle upbeat music) (birds chirping) So what are we looking for? Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats. See if I can get in and out of there in a minute 30 and not get caught in the first three minutes after, I'll always get away. Oh, there he is. (Gilbert laughing) I love this guy. Look at him. So horny. Look at him. You've been here before. Yeah. Yeah, but only on recon. So he's the weakness? And the opportunity. Wait, you're going now? Yep. Wait, you're leaving. Oh my God. - Wish me luck. - What? Oh my God. Okay. (gentle upbeat music) (car engine revving) Hey man, you're Carl? I'm Carl. No, oh my God. Oh, did you drive the Plymouth? Yeah. I just saw somebody over there, looks like they were trying to jimmy something in there. You kidding me? Yeah, looked like it might be a burglary. (laughing) (gentle upbeat music) Where are you? (gentle upbeat music) Wait, what the hell? (alarm ringing) Oh no. (alarm ringing) (fire engine sirens blaring) [Andrea] Oh my God. (dramatic music) Oh my God. Is he talking to me? Oh my God. Oh my God. What? What? Oh my God. (Gilbert laughing) Are you okay? Yeah. You know, it's always a bit of an adrenaline rush, but other than that, it's good. There was so much going on, I didn't know where you were. That means I did my job. Look at that. Look at that. This is wild. Yeah, I know baby. Look, I know, I know it's a lot, but hopefully, you know, we can get through. (fire engine sirens blaring) What are you thinking? You gotta promise me something. Actually, a couple of things. Okay. One, you never get caught. Of course. Two, you just rob banks. I mean, they've screwed over everyone I've ever cared about. So I can live with that. Sure. What else? You do this until we can retire. And we take the baby, you get that beach bar of yours and we move on a hundred percent legit, you're done. Deal. Actually, you gotta promise me something first? Oh yeah, what's that? (gentle music) Will you marry me? Robert. Oh my God. Is that a yes? Yes. Oh my God. (gentle music) (birds chirping) All right, the last two guys, we need to ID. Still nothing on him, huh? Not a thing? Not a thing, he's a ghost. What about the other guy, anything? Didn't he drive the same car? Yeah, they all do. They're like a Chrysler Fifth Avenue gang. Tommy and Dave have one too. The other guy drove the same exact car, same plates. Registered to an Andrea Hudson. What's the explanation? I think I'm gonna find out. (gentle upbeat music) Someone's had a few. Oh, hey, why you say that? You're still in disguise. Oh shit. Don't get sloppy kid. Yeah, you know, I hear you. But to be honest, I've just been focusing on that one last job. That's our big one. Then I'm gonna be owning a place just like this, but ocean side. Got it figured out yet? Not quite, not quite, but I have been casing out a place out West the last few months. You know, this is the big one. I'm calling it The Big Vancouver. Oh, you're naming your jobs now. Yeah, Robert would have trading cards with his stats on it if he could. That is actually a really good idea. Yeah. Bigger job, you know, you're gonna need a second man. No, I don't need a second man. Yeah, what about Bishop? Come on. That guy, no. - Yeah. Come on, he's a good man. Yeah, no, definitely don't need a second man. Come on, I got an investment to protect. You get a second pair of eyes. I don't need a second man. Robert, I insist. (gentle upbeat music) Okay, you know what? I can talk about this some other time, okay. Right now I gotta get back to the wife. You got a wife? Yeah, well fiance technically. Yeah, I've had the ring the last couple of months, but I just decided now was the time. Well hell congratulations kid. Thank you. Hey, to Partner's rye and your fiance. And my baby to be. It's package deal. Double fledge. (both laughing) Well, how about that? All right, I'm gonna take a piss and get outta here before she has my nuts. [Tommy] Okay. [Gilbert] Oh and, got something for you. What the hell's that? "Karma Chameleon" is track one. Huh? MTV baby. Oh, it's this George Boy guy. He's fucking everywhere. What the fuck is with that? Hey Detective, you finally here to throw down that warrant? Nah, no, just a deuce T bag. Well, you must really like this place. The only thing I'll ever like about this place is the look on your face when I shut it down. And that's just a matter of time. Oh, time's a funny thing. Let it run long enough, warrants expire, funding dries up, people get hurt. (upbeat music) I'll light a match for you. Yeah. Choke a loaf. (Gilbert whistling) Oh hey. - Hey. - Hey. Boy George fan, huh? Yeah, yeah. I am. You know, I think he's underrated. - Yeah. - I like him. Yeah. - Oh wow, too much makeup. Even for me, everyone thinks I got fucking eyeliner on you know. (both laughing) Yeah. It looks like you're wearing eyeliner. You're not? - No, no. - Oh. Be who you are, you know. Yeah, yep. Okay, sure. You take care. Bye, bye. Hey, "Changing Every Day" that's on that album too, right? I think so. I think so. Yeah, what do you think he's trying to hide? I don't know, man. I'm more into the tune than the lyric. You know what I mean? Yeah. Catchy. Okay then we'll see you. Yeah. Fuck me. Jesus Christ. (dramatic music) Those two guys drive the exact same car because they're the exact same guy. He's wearing disguise, he's got fake skin and the wig and the whole thing. Why? I don't know why. Well let's run his plates in and find out. Yeah and call every costume and prosthetics place, coast to coast. (car engine revving) (telephone ringing) [Woman] John, seriously. Sorry, honey. (telephone ringing) Yeah. Better be good. District's been keeping tabs on various people, various vehicles over the last few months. I know. One of our guys was heading back to the precinct past the 7-Eleven, an old Buick was there, but they didn't think much of it, but they thought they'd seen it before. Couldn't quite shake this feeling that maybe. Okay if there's a point, now's the time get to it. Right, right, well it turns out the car belongs to somebody that we brought in for a DUI, then a failure to appear in court. Okay, he's screwed, I get it. Why am I here? He wanted to talk to you. (dramatic music) Hey. Hey, our two guys are not only the same guy I saw at The Playmate. He's also this guy. That's Robert? Yes, that's Robert. Diamond Dave says he's off on a job right now. Something Robert's calling The Big Vancouver. He's naming his jobs now. What do we have left in petty cash quick? Oh, come on. I've got maybe 50 left in my account for a plane ticket. Come on cough it up. - All right, all right, here. (dramatic music) [Gilbert] Are you okay? I need a bump. Oh my God. The job is a bigger rush, okay. Are you sure you're okay to do this? You sure it'll work? I know what the fuck I'm doing. You need to keep your shit together. I've cased this place three times. And if it's done right, we'll clear over a million in there. Everything before this was prologue. What the fuck is prologue? So just take a look at these, ready? So this is definitely him? Look, like I said on the phone from your fax, definitely him. - Okay. And you said something about money. Has he been back this week? Well, he came by asking about hiring actors. For what? I don't know, said he wanted to try something different. Maybe directing. Yeah, I'm gonna guess it's not that. [Woman] Hey, you can't go in there. Call Detective Hoffman it's fine. Seriously it's fine. Detective John F Snydes, my guy's already gotten the horn with your team, please. It's all right. I believe this man has come to your city to rob a bank within the next 24 hours. How fast can you get uniforms to sit on those locations? There's over 670 banks downtown. Well, the same place's get robbed each time he flies into any town. And I've narrowed it down to five. He's done two in a day. Maybe he's gonna up his personal best, I don't know. Can you help or not? (dramatic music) (car engines revving) (dramatic music) Anybody got eyes on anything? No, I got nothing. Negative. Okay, we're all looking for something big and different, right? Big and different. (dramatic music) Thank you. Take care. Well, that should do her. Hi, what is this? Four palms for delivery. [Man] You can't put those here. [Courier] Why not? Because we didn't order them. [Courier] Somebody ordered 'em. We got anybody posted at the mall? [Courier] I just put 'em where they told me to go. [Man] Okay, but. (dramatic music) Let's see, I think I'll take one of everything. No. No? No. - Jesus Christ. - Open up. Are you serious? Anyone else seeing this? [Man] Yeah, someone ordered them, sure. I did not. [Courier] This is God wins right? That's what the sign says, yes, this is God wins. Well then they're in the right place. [Snydes] Do me a favor, run the plates on that van. Hey, handle him. God dammit. Okay, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. [Man] Your demeanor's incredibly unprofessional. Hey you, get on the ground. Get the fuck on the ground. Get on the ground now. Hey, settle down. Easy. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Watch the front door. (dramatic music) There you go. All of it, all it, all of it, all of it. Robert, I think we got company. Get over here. You said my name, idiot. (dramatic music) You did great. (bombs exploding) (dramatic music) Fuck, he's not robbing a bank. He's hit the God wins at the mall. (dramatic music) Where'd he go? Where'd he go? Slow down, don't run. Be cool. Hey. [Woman] Hey. I got two possible suspects, moving north through the mall. Blue coveralls. Don't move! (people speaking indistinctly) Hands up, turn around. (dramatic music) [Hoffman] Snydes, yeah, I think I see 'em other side of the mall. Get outta here.. I got 'em. Yeah, they're heading to the West entrance. [Man] No, no, no, I got two over here heading East. [Man] Shit. Do we take them all? Go after the two that don't run. (alarm blaring) Go. Let's go. Oh shit. (dramatic music) Check that door. Fuck, I fucked up, I said your name. Just shut up and deal with the door. Shit. What? I forgot the gun. What? You did what? I must have left it in the store. We were moving so fast, I panicked. What is wrong with you, dude? Time's up Robert. Time's up. You shoot me, you don't recover anything. You still need evidence. Well, you're kind of exhibit A buddy. No, no, you and I both know that you don't have enough to hold me. No, don't do it. Hey, let's pick this up another time. Hey, don't, don't. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey dumb ass. Fuck. Shit. (telephone ringing) Hello. Pack your bags, baby. For real? For real. Check the top dresser drawer. No. All right, all right. I gotta go, I'll see you. Don't forget to pack your sandals. I gotta go. Okay, okay, bye. Cops will see we bought plane tickets. They're all over the airport. Which is why we're taking the train. Take that. I'll be in the bar car, you make sure you're somewhere else. See ya. (dramatic music) (car engine revving) Goddess, movers are on their way, we gotta go now. Andy. We definitely have to go. (car brakes screeching) Babe. (gentle upbeat music) (sirens blaring) I got it. Get a chair, get a wheelchair. Awesome. Okay. There you go, have a seat. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. (Andrea screaming) You okay. Okay just relax, relax, relax. You relax. [Doctor] You're doing great. Well how's it looking Doc? Oh my God. - Get outta here. - Oh my God. Oh my God. - What are you doing? I saw the, I saw the head, oh. Robert, Robert woman up. [Gilbert] Okay. [Doctor] Okay stay with me. Breathe, breathe, bear down and push. Push. (Andrea screaming) (both screaming) (baby crying) Give it to her. Oh my God. Oh my God. (gentle music) [Gilbert] Oh my God. Hi. (baby crying) It's so cute. You're so perfect. She's perfect. Hi. Hi. Don't poke her nose. - I'm just touching her. (gentle music) Hey. I'm your daddy. Yeah. I'm your daddy. (gentle music) (dog barking) (door breaking) Where the hell's everything? It's gone. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Fuck. [Gilbert Voice over] While Tommy was fencing 1.2 million in stolen jewels, the cops were tracing the shotgun from Vancouver right back to Diamond Dave. And me, well, when shit goes south, I go north. [Andrea] Robert, what? (birds chirping) Are you gonna tell me what's going on? Look, they're watching the airports and the train stations. This is the safe play. Tommy helped set this whole thing up, last minute. What about the plan? What about the Bahamas? Look, sitting there holding her in that hospital. I don't know, it's like I spent my entire life working towards something like this idea of an escape, this perfect ocean-side life, but with all this, you two are the only escape that I need. And like you said, "Wherever we are is home." Right? Are we safe? Yeah. Okay. New digs new town, right. They don't know who or where I am. So, welcome home. (people speaking indistinctly) (bike bell ringing) Hey. [Gilbert Voice over] It's not often you get a second chance where the universe opens up and says, "Don't fuck this up." But I was listening, I was out. Besides in bank robbery, they don't really have a bring your kid to work day. (birds chirping) All right, here we go. Here we go. Goddess, we're home. In here. Hi. Oh, I know that smile. You like that smile. I do like that smile, how are you? And how are you? Listen, we still need to talk about that addition on the office. Are we still good? Yeah. - Yeah? - Uh huh. Okay. [Gilbert] Of course. (door knocking) Oh, grab that, I'm gonna put her down. Yeah, okay, okay. Come on, let's go. Hey, I'm looking for my friend, Robert White man. Oh my God. - My good buddy. - What are you doing here? Ah, just passing through. Nobody just passes through Pembroke. That's damn right. Hey, she's putting the baby down. Grab a seat, I'll get some beers. - Sure. - All right. Hey. Thanks. [Gilbert] You got it. (Gilbert sighing) (Tommy laughing) Having a toddler is like owning a blender with no top. Her toys have toys. Yeah. You know, I always thought sweatpants were a sign of defeat, but you actually make 'em look good. They should stick you in a storefront. All right, Tommy, what are you really doing here? You're not used to having any real friends, are you? I just came to see how you were doing. Yeah? Yeah. I'm good. I'm real good. You sure? Yeah. 'Cause I never thought I'd see the day when Robert White man be cutting his own grass. Yeah, whoever thought that weeds would be my biggest problem, right? You don't miss it. Nah. Nah, it was just a means to an end. You know the older I get, I realized all the stuff I don't need. All the stuff that when I go, they're just gonna toss it in the trash. Yeah, well you'll definitely have the nicest trash on the block. [Tommy] Thank you. Yeah. It's funny, I can't think of a single toy I ever had as a kid. Probably because I never had much of anything at all. Used to me piss me off, seeing all these other kids playing with their toys and shit. I had zip, but that was okay. 'Cause it taught me to appreciate what I earned. See once you know what it's like to have something, well then you gotta have more. It doesn't matter whether you're rich or poor. You're always gonna live to just a little bit beyond your means. So you gotta know your limits. You, me, we got everything, everything that matters. All that other shit is just ashes and dust, like we're gonna be. So what are you saying, you getting outta the game? Nah, nah, nah, too old to grow up. But you, do not tickle the balls of the lion on the way out kid. Hate to see you get mauled. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (insects chirping) Shit. (gentle music) No. I gotta do just one more. One last one. We'll find another way. It's the only thing I've ever been good at. There is no other way. There's always another way. We had a deal. Okay? Okay. You're right, you're right. It was a stupid idea. You promise? I promise. I'll make a few calls in the morning and I'll see what I can do. Okay. (gentle music) (baby babbling) Don't be like me. (gentle music) (baby babbling) Thank you. (gentle music) (insects chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) Robert. (baby crying) What are you crying about? Come on. Robert. How are you, today? Robert. Let's get some food. (gentle upbeat music) Car's still in the driveway, White man's gone. I think Andrea and the kid are still inside. It's taken us this long to get this far, I am not gonna let him get away. [Hoffman] Any ideas? (gentle upbeat music) (telephone ringing) Hello. Hey, is Rob there please? No, he's not. Can I take a message? Nah, nah, no worries, no, I'll call back. I'll call back, thanks. He's not there. Got spook jumped town? I don't know. No, no, he wouldn't leave without her. We only got the TRU and the war for tonight, we gotta make this happen. He's making a move. He's making a move. Call the airports, call the train stations, okay. I'll call the buses and the car rentals. Come on, let's go, this goes down now or we start all over. (dramatic music) (telephone ringing) [Gilbert] Goddess. (laughing) Hi. So anything? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I got in touch with an old buddy of mine who has a line on a gig out here. It's just sale stuff, nothing fancy. But I dunno it'll pay the bills, right? When will you know? Well, I'm supposed to sit down with them soon. So I have a really, really good feeling about it. Well, I'm sure it'll be great. Yeah. Yeah. So I should be home by like 4:30. Can you pick me up at the airport? Sure. Yeah, of course, I'll see you then. Hey, you know. I love you too. Bye, bye. (gentle music) Okay, all right, let me know. Nothing, nothing at the airport, train stations or buses. We're not paying you to sit on your asses, go do something. Hey wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, pass me that over there. (gentle upbeat music) Did you check the local airport? (upbeat music) (car engine revving) He may have chartered a flight out of Pembroke to Toronto.

His pants fit like a glove. (both laughing) I knew it. I got you, I got you. (telephone ringing) You know what amazes me? - What's that? - You, you. - Really? - Yes. Well, thank you. You knew we were watching you and you just, you kept going. I mean, what you weren't loved enough as a kid? Is that, that is eyeliner isn't it? - Well maybe it's Maybelline. - If it's not, then well... beautiful eyelashes. What do you say, you give us Tommy and we give you less time? Tommy's a businessman. There's nothing to give, ever. And you got nothing on me, so. No, no, no. Well we ran your prints with the feds. - Oh? - Yeah. Vincent Smears is a terrible name. I mean, I can see why you went with White man. Well. You got me. You guys are good. Okay, I'll tell you more, if you let me have a face to face with my wife. She's not exactly your biggest fan right now. Especially after learning your name isn't actually White man. (door knocking) Did somebody order a pizza? Oh yeah, right here. (bell ringing) Thank you. There we go. You want some? [Snydes] No, I'm good, I'm good. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm good. It's all you. Run the prints with the feds again. There's something wiry, okay. Hey, how is he? Cocky and arrogant as hell, yeah. But he grows on you, yeah. Oh, and get me the wife. So if your name isn't Robert White man, is it just asshole or? Well, there are a few things that I may have left out. Yeah. So what are you just a bank robber now? Is there anything else you left out? Hmm. When we met, I had one thing in my life. I believed in people. And you're not gonna take that away from me. Robert, look at me. You gotta tell me, was I a part of this big lie? Was I a cover? No. You're the only real thing in my life. I'm more me around you than I've ever been around anyone. You taught me how to live, you taught me how to love, you taught me how to trust. And that's the truth, that's not a lie. All right, well that was pretty good. I still think you're an asshole though. Also the truth. Yeah. I'm sorry. And I know that's never gonna be enough, but I'm sorry. I fucked up. I fucked it up. So now what? You should run. Get as far away from me as you can, I can handle this. Clearly you can't. And you know what? I'm not like you Robert. (gentle music) I don't run. (gentle music) (door buzzing) How you been, partner? Treating you okay in here? I'm all right, I'm all right. Look, I'm sorry if any of this brought shit down on you. Hey, they found you through me. I should be apologizing to you. What kind of time they talking? I'm looking at 20. I copped to all the robberies, they're... probably charge me for two. Probably be out by '98, '99. Yeah, you could probably do a better deal, you turn in the others. Me alone, you'd be out in eight. I don't know a lot about friends or family, but I would never do that. You know, plenty.
