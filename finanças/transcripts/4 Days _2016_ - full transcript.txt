Stop. Stop! Derek Derek Derek. - Sorry dude. - Hey buddy. You must be the new roommate. - What's your- - Mark. Mark, I'm Derek. This is my girlfriend Erika. Mark. Sorry, sorry... Just continue... I will uh... leave you two alone now. Alright, I'll see you later tonight, right? You're not going to leave me alone on Valentine's Day, are you? Of course not baby. Call me. See you. Oy! You're going to interrupt me having fun with my girlfriend and not bother to say hi? I'm sorry. I will just get my other stuff, I left some behind. Go get that later, sit down for a minute. Let's talk. You can understand Tagalog? Yeah, somehow. Why? Hmm... Do I look like a foreigner? Actually yes, you look like an American. My dad is. I'm???? actually. Take a seat let's talk! Okay... Uh... So... Me and my ex-roommate had something of an arrangement. What kind of arrangement? Every time we had a girl over we would make sure we put a sock on the door so that the other guy wouldn't walk in on us like you just did. So, it's my fault now. Walk in. Do you have a problem with that? No, no, no it's okay. No, I don't have a problem with that. Good. So we're okay? Yep, that's it. Okay then, I'm late for class. Suprise! Now, what? You thought it's gonna be Alex, huh? What the fuck? You know I'm preparing a song for Alex! You stink! I stink? You armpit stinks! Are you sure? Maybe you want to take another sniff. You really stinky! Did you even take a bath? Oh maybe - Seriously, get off me! Alright, so maybe a little. So you did take a bath! I may or may not remember taking a bath this morning. But wow, the fact that you thought of taking a bath... I thought- Yeah! But still that's something different. So it means you are that serious about Alex. Yeah, yeah of course. I am serious about Alex for sure. Well it looks like you are because you bought her balloons and pillows And you asked me to write a song and you are going to sing her that song, in Tagalog. But you suck in speaking Tagalog. I made an effort, how's that? That's what I'm saying. I'm better than last year, you must admit. I have progress. That's it, you put effort. And yes, I bought balloons. We have practiced the song. And she's going to love it because I love her. - You love her? - I love her. Oh. Oh. Oh my! And thank you also, cause it wouldn't have been half as special as it's gonna be if it weren't for the song. Thank you. Whatever. But please make sure, you will never hurt Alex. Pshhh. You're... I'm serious about her. I'm serious about her this time. Yeah I know I know. But see, Alex is my friend. I don't want you messing this up cause this could cost us our friendship. Maybe all the things I've done for her will be wasted just because you can't stick to your relationship. I am actually serious about this one this time. Okay whatever but I've heard that 1,000 times before. How many times did you say that? So how many girls? Okay, okay. Let's do the Math. When was the first time you said you're serious? Erika! To Erika... right? Erika did not give me anywhere near enough space and I thought Space! Okay space! Okay fine. Let's go to Sandra. Now with Sandra, she was in a political party so, basically she was really busy. You only see each other for two weekends. That was also a reason why. Sandra was kind of political and Of course she was! That's not the issue. Okay fine fine! - How about Erika #2? - Okay I get the point. Erika #2 you met in a bar. And she was sleeping with other people and it was okay with you. I've had a lot of ex-girlfriends. Actually there are four other people I haven't mentioned! I've been busy. - Yes you have been busy. - Okay, how about you? - And "serious" apparently - Okay so I've had my share - But you haven't had anywhere - Let's not go there Haven't had anywhere near enough ex-girlfriends! Oh my god, what is enough for you? There is something wrong when I worry about your sex life more than you do. You need to get laid, buddy. I'm not that kind of person, okay? Can you please just understand that? Because I'm focusing on my studies, okay? If you want it to be special, fine. But why? You've seen single for two years going on three? Does it matter? I mean... It's not about... I don't know. Why are you directing the conversation to me? I'm not the topic of this discussion. I'm single and I'm happy. I've moved on, but... it's just not my thing. We're not the... Back to the point: I'm actually serious about this one. So it's enough. Okay. It's just hard to trust you in this kind of thing. You've said those things before. Your hand stinks. This' got to end somewhere. That's enough! Do I really stink? You didn't take a bath. Alright then, no seriously Derek. If you're really serious about her, show it. Coming. Hey Alex. What's this?

I'm just messing with you. Cheer up, come on! There's nothing wrong with you. There's just a lot of things wrong with your exes, okay? Okay, let's start with Erika 1. Oh my God it tickles! Someone's in the mood. No no, ah. And then Sofia. Sofia who is like, umm... she has this very deep voice. That sometimes I mistake her for you. Hey Derek, can you get me a cab? Can you come over Derek? Derek I love you Derek can you kiss me Derek Oh wait wait! Fine fine. Ericka #2. Then Erika number two, there was one time you left the sock on the door. There was no place I can go to, because it was late night I was just standing there and I could hear her. I have a question Is Erika number two Japanese? Because all I can hear was... I mean, really, is she Japanese? I didn't hear you though You are laughing now. Let's go to Pam! Pam is very sassy like... Right? Hi Derek! Like, can you go with me to them prom??? What prom? Like prom Derek! She's so ditzy! She like vomits rainbows and butterflies like Ahh! Am I right? And then there's Janine. Janine is also one of a kind. She has a big ass. Like really a big ass. When she sits down she's like three feet taller. Right? And you like that! Okay don't get me going. Then Lea... Lea is so dead serious. She's really in to you. She's the most recent but she's like Derek, I love you Derek. Derek, we did it once. We made love Derek. We're one. Derek do you love me too? Sorry... Sorry, sorry. I'm off... But really you should go with us to the concert. It's Valentine's Day and you're alone here. Come on and join us! Come in. Come on Derek! Bro! Come on! We'll be late. Our girls are waiting. Oh, girls again. Bro, the concert. Yeah the concert, I almost forgot. Because of this man, he doesn't want to join us. Are you really letting Reena wait? She has a thing for you bro. Okay fine. But how about this one? Hey Derek, are you coming with? Derek! Come on man. Come on bro, there are a lot of girls. He is heartbroken. Okay, okay. Come on, let's go. Bro! Let's go. Let's go! Derek You shall get over your ex Oh well! Reena and the others left, and so did James so, I decided to leave too. If you didn't like what happened between us, it's okay Derek. I understand. I will just tell Mrs. Esguerra that I'm transferring to another room later or tomorrow. I do understand. Have I ever told you how much I hated ketchup when I was a kid? When I was about 5 or 6, it was my worst food in the entire world. There was no way you could get me to eat ketchup. And... I just avoided ketchup like the plague for pretty much my entire childhood. And then sometime junior year, I uh... I was really hungry and I ate t he first thing I saw in a cafeteria, I didn't bother to look inside. And it was one of the best sandwiches I ever had in my entire life I told myself right after I had it, I'm gonna have to have more. And when I ask what was inside the sandwich, it was ketchup. The food that I hated, something I never thought I might like, ended up being my favorite food of all time. Right now, you feel like ketchup. And I don't even know how to begin to describe what just happened but I mean... I don't want to pretend it didn't happen. Derek you're just confused. Okay? We're just the same. Even me, I am just confused. I don't know what to do because... I didn't know this would happen. It is your first time right? Let's just think it through, please. I know you. I know you well. I know you. You had relationships with girls. If those didn't last, why would with me? I am so confused. To be honest. I don't know. I'm late for class, okay? Oh that boy! He hasn't changed, he is still messy. Will he take too long? All I know is that he has a class but I just don't know what time it will finish. I'll surprise him. You know, it's Valentine's Day. Us, mothers, sometimes like to be their sons' date. Has he ever mentioned a girl he is into or crazy about? Oh well... You know before, he introduced a girl to me. He brought her home. I think her name is Erika, yeah Erika. But they didn't last that long. They lasted for only two months. That's why I'm scared of him, because I might be surprised. That one day he will just bring a pregnant girl home, right? I think that would be impossible to happen. Why did you say so? He is American. One-night stands are nothing to him. Just like his father. He is just like me. So look what happened, I got pregnant with him. Will it take him too long? I'm not that sure. I've been texting him but he's not replying. Maybe his phone's battery is low. Oh! Mom! Why are you here? Surprised?! Of course, it's Valentine's Day. I'm your date tonight. I did. Why? You don't want it? Because I haven't seen you for awhile. I thought you might have a girlfriend. Do you have one? I should intro - - Yeah Mark - Yeah you met We talk about you. What exactly did you talk about? Oh, nothing. I should've visited sooner and I'm... Are you Right now? I know a restaurant, they serve good food. I want you to come with me and be your date. I promised I would see one person tonight and I, I... Well you came out of... you didn't exactly tell me you were coming! What time is it? Mark, what time is it? - Uh... - I cannot wait any longer! How about I'll be back at 9PM sharp, so be prepared. If you aren't good to go at 9PM, I won't give you your allowance for next week. Wow okay, I'm gonna be there, I promise. Bye bye. I missed you too. See you later. So cool! What? Nothing! Why? Cause I know you better than that. Than what? You wanna let something out and if you don't do it in a normal way it's gonna get way out of control very fast. Very soon. But there's really nothing. No, I'm okay. I have no problem. Like none at all. In fact I'm so happy! I'm really really happy! What? Come on just tell me. Tell you what? There's none. Do I have a problem? I don't really have a problem. Derek, we've been together for quite awhile now I don't have a problem. How about you? Do you have a problem? I'm a happy guy. I'm a happy guy in a happy relationship. Okay, so am I. I'm also a happy guy in a happy relationship. Oh there it is. What? - Now it's coming out. - What's coming out? I'm a happy guy in a happy relationship! What else can I ask for? What? It's Valentine's Day, let's not do this. Exactly! It's Valentine's Day, there's no reason to be angry or frustrated or sad or unhappy. Is there a reason? Is there something you want to tell me? Huh? Is there something you want to tell me? Is there something you're not telling me? Huh? For me to be frustrated? There's nothing to say, right? I want to tell you Happy Valentine's Day Oh well Happy Valentine's Day to you too! Hmm. No, really. How about you? What is your problem? Huh? What is your problem? Why don't we skip this and jump to what you really want to say. What I want to say? Now you want to hear what I want to say? My mom was in the room, I didn't come out I never said that. - No I never told you that Derek - You really really wanted - I never said that Derek - Yeah you do I never demand you to come out to your mother right in front of her face... I never said that Then why are you angry? I am not angry! I am not angry! I kind of think you are. You kind of think I am. Is there a reason for me to be angry? Tell me! Is there a reason for me to be angry? No, there isn't. Because I'm eventually going to in my own time. Okay your own time. Okay then let's follow that! One year down, how many more years to go, huh? How many more years to go? I'm not ready. I'm not ready! Oh my! Oh my Derek! It's always about you isn't it? It's always about your time. It's always about your happiness. - It's always about you. - That's not fair. The world revolves around you, right? Am I correct? What about my happiness? What about my perspective? What about what I'm feeling? Did it ever cross your mind? Did you ever considered it? Don't touch me, okay? For once did it ever cross your mind, how I feel? Huh? It's been one year Derek! It's been one year! Has anything happened? Nothing happened! Because we are following your pace. Your time. That's what it's about right? What's wrong with that? What's wrong with that? What's wrong with just a little bit more time? Derek every time, we have to be in this room. We can only be like this here. Once we leave that door we are nothing. Everything we have just stays in this room! That doesn't I like you or love you any less. But still! What do you want me to think, it's been a year! And then your mom comes in, and she's right here in front of us and you don't introduce me or anything! This is the first time that happened that a person comes in this room the only place where we can be together and be happy and be ourselves. But not a thing changes. So what do you want me to think? Huh? What do you want me to think? Don't touch me! What do you want me to feel, huh? Do you want me to think that you love me? Even though we've been together for a year and that... You've never told anyone, not even your best friend? Not even your best friend? You are my best friend. Oh now I'm your best friend! You're not only my best friend. But your the first person in my life is what I was trying to say. Okay the, why don't you show that to the other people huh? Why can't you do that if front of other people if I really am your best friend? What's wrong with that? I don't see anything wrong with that. This isn't fair. What isn't fair, Derek? This isn't fair! What you're doing to me isn't fair! What I'm feeling right now isn't fair! And how okay you are with this and how not okay I am with this - Calm down. - Calm down?! You're telling me to calm down? Oh my - what's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? Oh my God! One year! One year! And you haven't told anyone! And your mom was just hear a while ago, you didn't do anything! What am I supposed to feel, huh? Do you still want me to feel happy about this? Really? - Calm down. - Are you that cold-hearted? No don't tell me to calm down! Don't you ever tell me to calm down! Huh? When are you going to be ready? Cause I'm ready! I'm ready! I've always been ready! You're the one who's not ready! And that's so unfair! When are you going to be ready? When I'm not ready anymore? When I'm done? When I'm tired? Huh? Don't touch me! Are you ashamed of me? Of course-of course not! Then show it! If you really are not ashamed of me then let our relationship be freed from that door Huh? When would that be Derek? That's not fair. You know what's fair? Me giving up. I'm tired. - Don't say that. - I'm tired. - Don't say that. - Just... Just go have dinner with your mom, okay? - I'm tired. - Don't leave. Don't leave. Don't touch me, don't come after me! Okay? Don't talk to me. Just stay here, wait for your mom, and go out with her okay? I'm tired, Derek. Hold on. Just, hold on. Let's go to the room. Let's just talk about this like we normally do. In the room. Okay? Derek if you want to say something why don't you just say it here. Like we normally do. In the room. I don't wanna... Why would I wanna do this in front of- This is what I'm saying You're just proving me that you can't. You are embarrassed of me, is that it? It's not that I'm embarassed What do you mean you're not? Why can't you do it right here? Eventually, you know. I've told you before. It's been a year It's so tiring It's been a year, Derek and you haven't even told your best friend about us, or even your friends This is why - you haven't told anyone even to a single person from your group how come? Do you even know how painful that is? Everyday Okay so you wanna go and explode in the library where tons of other people Is that so? Yeah because you are ashamed of me Until somebody escorts us - Let's just go to the room You can't even mention it to your friends. You can't say it to your family Let's just finish this in the room, please! And now you're the one who's furious. After all the things you did I've been holding back for so long, but still you're the one who has the right to be furious You didn't tell your family, you didn't tell your mother She was just right there, and you lied in front of me. You lied to her just like that. - That's my mom - Exactly she's your mother Your mother, your friends, you said nothing to anyone It's been a year and I'm tired. I am going to do it. I am going to- Listen to me! When would that be? I don't know yet Exactly I have no idea when would that “I don't know” be I'm tired I'm just asking for more time. That's all I'm asking for, more time. If you want to fix something, fix it here. We're making enough of an embarassment of ourselves. Look around. Let's go to If you want to fix it, fix it now. Are you going to do it? Fuck! Mark! - Get up! - Hey! What? No! What are we going to talk about? Wait, wait. If you're not going to do it, then don't talk to me anymore. I'm tired.
