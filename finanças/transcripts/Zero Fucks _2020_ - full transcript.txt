And today is everybody's favorite day. - No pants day. - Yeah! [Daniel] No pants day! Hey, everybody. I'm here. Reporting from Sparks Nuclear site. And let me tell you guys, there is a chilly, cold front coming in. Yeah, alright now, that's enough of that. [Adam] Oh, sorry. - Movie! Movie! - Put a movie on. - [Daniel] It's fake. - [Donald] No way. [Daniel] Totally fake. Tons of evidence. [Donald] Yeah, like what? Like the American flag waving in zero gravity. There's no air in the atmosphere on the moon. Therefore, no winds to make the flag blow. - Fuck. - Fuck is right. And there's, like, ten other things that I... I won't get into with you. No, no, come on, get into it. What is it? What else? No, it's... it's too scientific. Just trust me, okay? The moon landings fake. That's why you won't tell me, because I'm a cat? Look, if you want to learn more about it, there's books and shit. - [Donald] You know I can't read. - Yeah, then that's why. Because you're a cat who can't read. If you were a cat who could read, then you could learn things and we could discuss more. Oh, like what, about science because I know a lot about science, okay? I know more than you, I could teach you about science, mister. - Yeah, sure. Okay. - Yeah. I was raised in a fucking lab, you asshole, okay? - I was... I was experimented on. - Sorry. Yeah, this is the whole reason why I have so many health issues. - [Daniel] Okay, don't freak out. - So thanks for bringing that up. - [Daniel] I'm just saying. - I am not freaking. - Okay? I am a talking cat. - I can't do this right now. Oh, and you... and you all... Oh, you think you're so hot, you survived and shit. Oh! Oh, you are... Oh! Oh, look at us. Oh, we are... Oh, we are the last people on earth. Oh, we're so special. None of you are special. Special my ass. You're sterile. You're all sterile, everyone of you is sterile. I bet half of you can't get it up even. Yeah, yeah. That's what I bet. You can't get it up. Whereas I am the last animal on earth with even a shred of fertility. So suck it. [Daniel] You know what? Fuck you, Donald. When we found you, you were malnourished, you were dehydrated, you had an eye infection, an ear infection, a fucking urinary tract infection. You had diarrhea, fucking fleas. You probably had cat aids, okay? We saved your butt. So how about a little more gratitude and a little less cattitude? Oh, you don't like my cattitude? - No. - Oh, I'm so sorry, Daniel. Did I hurt your little feelings? - No, shut up. - I will scratch your - fucking eyes out. - I... I... I got to go. I got fucking radio. Oh, look, come on, come back here, you coward. I want to hear about - the moon landing. - Shut up. I want to hear about it with the moon and the fake and... Come on! Danny? You know, you're a little mouse. A scared little mouse. - [Daniel] Shut the fuck up. - Dan! You're a mouse. - You're a scared little mouse. - [Daniel] Shut up. - That's what you are. - No, you... Are you going to follow me all the way to the radio? - I got stuff to... - Danny! Daniel! Danny! Dan! [exhales] Come on, Danny. Come on, Danny boy. Danny, Danny, Daniel. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Donald's sorry. Donald's so sorry. [Donald purring] [Kate] Who touched my cream corn? Daniel? Donald? - [Daniel] Hi, Kate. - Did you eat my cream corn? - No. - Donald? - Hi, Crazy! I don't eat corn. - But you can see in the dark. So did you see who did eat my cream corn? Oh, it's like every week with your blow ups. Everyone's out to get you, Kate. What was it the last week? The Lululemon sweats? And then what, the week before that, with the thousand island dressing, huh? Who would eat your salad dressing, Kate? And then you want me to figure it out with my cat powers, like I'm some sort of gypsy, psychic or something. So, no, Kate, I did not eat your fucking cream corn, and I don't know who did. I think Donald ate your cream corn. - Fucking Donald! - Yes, I did. I ate your cream corn. I ate the cream corn. And the other stuff? I did. I ate the thousand island. I had nothing to do with the Lululemon, though. Ah, so I guess it's fine. You're just eating my food, but you don't touch my stuff. Oh... Oh, and you named me Donald Pump, so fuck you. He's the one that ruined the world, remember? And the reason that we're all in this mess. And you go ahead and name me after him. A really good move, okay? So every once in a while I eat something, right? And it might be yours. Who cares? Big fucking deal. At least I didn't name you after the shit who ended the world. [Kate] You got light, fluffy yellow hair. What do you want? The name seemed to fit. And everyone liked it, so it stuck. Live with it. [Kate hisses] All of my nine lives, I live with it every day. So fuck you and fuck you, fuckers. - [Daniel] I love that guy. - [Kate] Yeah, where is everyone? I don't know. - Not here. - Not here? - [chuckles] - Daniel! [Daniel] What? Nothing. Did you miss me? [Daniel] I just saw you, like, an hour ago. Okay, in the hour that you hadn't seen me, did you think about me? Did you think, "Oh, where's Kate? I wonder where Kate is. Oh, I'd love to see Kate." So you missed me. I guess. Okay, just the next time a girl asks you, just fucking lie - and say yes, okay? - Okay. Yeah. No, you're... you're totally right. I'm sorry. It's just my residual nerd awkwardness. I, uh, wasn't so popular with the ladies before, so now that I'm getting a little female attention, it's... - Oh, are you? - Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, it's just I'm still not so great - with the girls. - No, you're not. Thank God you have a big dick. I mean, it's great being alive with the last group of people on earth and everything. But if no one had a big dick, I'd have fucking killed myself. [Daniel] I have... - [Kate] You saved me, Dan-Dan. - I have a big dick? - Biggest one in the group. - Oh, so technically, the biggest dick in the world, right? You have the biggest fucking dick in all of mankind. Hey, who's got a big dick? [both groan] - Hey. - Not you. - Get the fuck out of here. - [Adam] Daniel, what's up, man? You're on radio watch. - Anything? - I heard from your mom. She wanted to know if you were still wearing panties again. You guys honestly think I wouldn't tell you if a fucking radio message came in? Oh, yeah. One did come in yesterday. Did I forget to tell you? I heard from some people in fucking Fiji, and they wanted to know if we'd come visit. [Daniel] Uh, tell them no, okay? Well, I'm going. - Ass face. - Yeah. - Kate, Kate. - Come on. - I'll miss you. - [Kate] Oh, he's learning. That was sweet. - Say hi to your mom. - [Daniel] I'm an orphan. - [Kate] Me too. - Me three. Come on. Shit. Fucking... [sighs] So, uh, who's got a big dick? [Kate] I don't know, do you? [Adam] Well, you tell me. - Um, average, below average. - Oh, no, no. No, that's... It's big. It's big. Oh, I love your dick. It's such a cutie, tiny-mighty. Tiny-mighty? I'll show you tiny-mighty. Oh, you better. Come. [groans] I need something little... Okay, you guys are making out, alright. [both groaning] Oh, hey, do you want to stick it in my ass? - Oh, yeah! - Yeah. - Yeah! - [Kate groans] - [heavily breathing] - Get in there. - Get in there. - Jesus Christ cat! [sighs] You want a piece of me, huh? What do... What do you want, Donald? Well, Kate, uh, I found your Lululemon. Here it is, it kind of smells a little bit because I've been sleeping on it for a week. Sort of smells like... like ass, which I know you love, huh? You bitch! [laughing] - [Kate screams] - Bitch! You fucker! - Kate! - I can't, I can't with this cat. I fucking hate him. Can we just get rid of him? I mean, of all the cats, a kleptomaniac? Come on, Kate, we just found them two weeks ago. We're all getting used to each other. Come on. He gets pent up when we go to sleep at night. We're all pent up here. I don't steal your shit. You're wearing my Metallica shirt. - Oh, is that yours? - Yeah. And yes, I want to stick it in your ass. Oh, my God! Oh, God. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, are you making out? [Kate] Oh, he was just about to put it in my ass. But you're my boyfriend. There are no more boyfriends and girlfriends here, Wanda. I know, Adam, but you're still my boyfriend. Go ahead, fuck her ass. - Wanda, stop, I'm sorry. - This is Steve. - [Adam] Who? - Hi, y'all. He's a talking grasshopper. I just found him. - He's so cute and small. - Yo, I'm right here. Don't talk about me in third person, okay? Right. Sorry. Uh, you can talk. That's so cool. How is it like being a cricket? - What did she call me? - A cricket. I'm no cricket, bitch. I'm a grasshopper. [Kate] Well, aren't they the same thing? - This monkey is ignorant. - Huh! Yo, Steve, calm down, okay? You can't go calling people Monkeys. Oh, why? People and monkeys are different? - You look the same to me. - Alright, I get it. I get it. No, no. Crickets are lazy, dumb as fuck. And all dead, by the way. Us grasshoppers, we're smart and damn handsome if I say so myself. Thriving, even in these unfortunate circumstances. We're all over the place. How many of you around? Okay, just... What's that joke? A grasshopper walks into a bar and the bartender is like, hey, what's... Is that your name? [Steve] What? What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. - [Wanda] Come on, Steve. Let's leave these monkeys to fuck each other in the ass. Yeah, that's weird, yo. You got some weird ass friends, Wanda. I know, but they're all I got. [sighs] A talking grasshopper! So cute. Now where were we? - Monkey stuff? - Yeah. ♪♪ Seriously, will you just say I have a big dick? What? What's with the penis envy? Just strange you want a big dick is all, I don't... I don't know. Maybe all women do. Why is it strange that I'd want a big dick? Because, you know, Hips McGee, it seems like it would hurt. No, it feels great. Daniel fucks and fucks me like Tarzan, and it's amazing. - No fuck for you. - Wait, hold on. Kate, we're just talking here. - Just wait. - Get out of here, Tiny. Tiny? What's that smell? I don't know, smells like Italian sausage, like burning pizza or something. - Donald ate Steve. - What? The cat ate the grasshopper. - I'm going to kill him. - Good, do it. Hey, cats eat grasshoppers all the time. - [Kate and Wanda] Shut up! - Ladies! Why did you eat Steve? What? The grasshopper? Yes, you fucker. Why? - Protein. - I'm going to kill you. Hey, take it easy. Leave him alone. We should all be eating grasshoppers. He was a talking grasshopper. How many have you met? Talking shit. He was very rude. He was angry. You knew he could talk? Well, of course, he had a mouth on him, that one. Lots of arguments and then the begging. And then anyway, Yum-Yum, end of discussion. He was very... very, uh, tasty. And he had sort of an earthy, earthy tone. Hey, the smell's getting stronger. Oh, yeah, yeah. That's the gas from the outside. It's been coming in for a few minutes. You should probably get the plastic. - Go, go, go. - Everyone go to the plastic. Plastic, Daniel. - [Adam] Plastic. - [Daniel] What? [Adam] There's gas. Get to the plastic. - Go and get under the plastic. - Thank you for the warning. [Kate] Daniel, bring the plastic. - Do you hear me? - Under the plastic. - Get the plastic, Daniel. - Faster. [all coughing] Oh, yay. - Guys! - Donald, you'll kill us all. Oh, no! Oh, my God, Donald, stop. [all shouting] - Donald! - Stop! Stop! Get the fuck out! Alright, it's gone, it's gone. - It's all gone, I guess. - [Adam] What? - It's gone. - [Adam] Daniel, check. [sighs] [Daniel] Yeah, it's gone. He's right. [plastic crackling] - It's gone. - That shit's not cool. [Adam] I love you. [sighs] - Daniel, where are your pants? - [radio static] [radio voice] Hello? Hello, is this... Hello, anyone there? Hello. - Holy fuck, get the radio. - Get the radio transmitter. - Go, go, go, go. - Oh! - Oh, the radio. [laughs] - [radio voice] Hello? - Hello? - [Adam] Get to the radio. [radio voice] Hello? Anyone there? Hello? Hello? Anyone there? Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? - We're not alone. - We're not alone. - I hope it's a cat. - [radio voice] Can you hear me? I hope it's a cat. Hello? Hello?

I can't believe it. Genius! Who are you? Where are you? [radio voice] In the sky, I'm flying a plane. Where are you? We're in Sparks Nuclear Site outside Los Angeles, right by the ocean. [radio voice] I'm flying over Los Angeles right now. How are you even flying? How are you able to stay outside? [radio voice] I have a special suit. Sparks Nuclear Site. I just found your location on my map. You got an air strip there? Is it clear? - Hello? - Yes. Yes. Can you hear us? Hello? [radio voice] I can hardly hear you, can you hear me? - Can you hear me? - Yes, we can hear you. - Who are you? - [radio voice] Can you hear me? My name is Ivanka Pump. Can you hear me? [radio static] Radio's dead. Did she just say her name is Ivanka Pump? I don't think so. Ivanka fucking Pump. - It... It can't be. It can't be. - Wow. I mean, what are the odds, right? It just can't be. [Daniel] No, there's no way. Radio was staticky. It can't be her, it's... it's too far-fetched. Ivanka Pump, it's so awesome. Awesome! What if it is her? What if she's coming here to finish the job? What do you mean? Like, what if there are Pump people out there and they're hunting survivors and we just gave up our fucking location? [sighs] I mean, we have no way of knowing that. You know, you really have no way of knowing anything. He's right, we don't know anything except that we just heard from the first human woman in... in however long since we've been here. And she's okay. She is surviving somehow, and she's out there flying a fucking plane. She's coming here now. I'm scared. Alright. Even if it is her, which I acknowledge is crazy. Never mind. It's fucking crazy. - She's wicked hot, though. - She is. By wicked hot, you mean she's the daughter of the devil? - Yes. - Hmm. [telepathically] Kate, can you hear my thoughts? [telepathically] This is strange. Yes, I can hear your thoughts. Are you hearing mine? What's going on? [Donald] Oh, hey, Kate. So... So now you can also hear thoughts. Cool. That's cool. - [Kate] What the fuck, Donald? - [Donald] What, bitch? [Kate] How am I hearing you in my head? [Donald] I can hear thoughts like a radio frequency. [Kate] Is it a cat thing? - Why am I hearing you? - [Donald] Well, it's an oddity hat's hard to explain in the landscape of poisonous gas and massive radiation, talking animals and wanting to have butt sex with Adam. And now Ivanka Pump literally falling out of the sky. [Kate] So it's a radiation thing? That makes some sense. [Donald] Radiation, yes. And also, you have cancer. [Kate] I have cancer? - How do you know? - [Donald] I hear it. [Kate] Fuck you. You're making shit up. [Donald] Okay, I'm making it up. [radio static] [Wanda] You're stupid. [Adam] I'll have to admit I do say some really dumb shit. I know that. Come over here. - Can we talk in here? - [Wanda] No, we can't talk. [Adam] Can we talk in here, please? [radio static] [Ivanka] Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you. Who are you? [Ivanka] I've landed my plane. I'm on the runway outside. Did you say before that you're Ivanka Pump? [Ivanka] Yeah, that's me. Look, I know that's probably a little shocking. Uh, yeah, your father literally killed everyone on Earth, so... [Ivanka] He also killed everyone I loved, I hate him too. I've been alone for years, flying around the country, looking for people, please, I'm sorry for what my father did, but it wasn't my fault. You're the only people I've found. Fuck you, Ivanka Pump. If anybody should have died, it's you. You and your whole family screwed up any piece of democracy we had left, and then America and then everything. I saw your hate speeches on TV. Your stupid face is on the $20 bill. Couldn't let Harriet Tubman have the spot. I hate you, you blonde shit. [Ivanka] I understand how you feel, I also hate who I was but that person is not me any more. I think we should let her in and deal with her then. - Let's put her on trial. - Let's let her in. I'm not letting her in unless we put her on trial. That's... That's crazy. Okay? How do we even do that? We'll figure it out. And that is more than she deserves anyway. Or I can just kill her if you prefer. Or we can put her on trial, and then I'll kill her. - It's up to you. - No, no killing anyone, okay? We've had enough death. [Ivanka] Hello? Please let me in. - [Wanda] Oh, dammit. Fine. - [Ivanka] Hello? Let her in. Just keep her away from me. I'll put on a gas mask and go get her. Hey, put some pants on. What's with the no pants? Is it no pants day? Is it? [metal clanks] [drawer clatters] Oh, dammit. ♪♪ ♪♪ If you fuck her, Adam, we're done. Done! You're not my girlfriend any more, Wanda. This isn't about us.

Read my lips as I articulate out loud the word no. Well, why don't you read my nail as I scratch the word bitch on your face? Hey, hey, stop it. Stop it, you two. Acting like children. I'll be the judge, okay? I feel nor here nor there about Ivanka. Okay, I'm... I'm happy she's joining us. I'm cool if we kill her, too, basically neutral. We'll all prosecute and reach the verdict together. She'll defend herself. Humanity versus Pump. [footsteps approaching] I do think I'd make a better judge. - I'm just saying, alright? - Me too.

I think we're going to be really good friends, and I love your name. Oh, sorry, I... I didn't mean it like that. - Hmm. - This is very awkward. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm just so excited to see you all. I haven't seen people in so long. Can I give you all a hug? - No. - [Ivanka] Okay, sorry. Oh, I did see a talking bear once. And two talking dogs, but never a cat. - There's bears out there? - [Ivanka] Oh, yes. And other different kinds of animals. Life is still going on. Ivanka, we have food and water. You do? I am starving. Wait, how do you have food and water? Well, Sparks is the biggest nuclear site in California. Hundreds of people worked here, maybe thousands. It was a self-sufficient, closed facility. So we have our own electrical system, water system, an indoor garden and a whole warehouse full of preserved food. ♪♪ And how did you all end up here? We were new recruits here on orientation day. Stuck us in a safe room for demo. Next thing you know, wave came, everything went black. People just evaporated. Uh, but we were... We were fine. Right place at the right time. You know, I was exploring the sewer pipe, uh, so curiosity saved the cat in this case. [laughing] Mmm, how did you survive? - Oh, I was in space. - What? Yeah, I was flying my spacecraft. Come on. You were a model doing catwalks in New York. - Catwalks? - Yeah, that. See, that was actually all just a cover up. I was being trained since I was a child, groomed, really. To take over Pump operations one day. - Groomed? - Mm-hmm. - Bullshit. - Bullshit. No, really. We were just priming the public to focus on my looks. So Pump could use me a distraction whenever he wanted. Worked like a charm. Yeah, I believe it. - Hi, my name is Adam. - Hi. She's distracting you right now. - I'm Wanda. - Hi, Wanda. Thanks for letting me in. We're going to put you on trial. - What? - Kate. - Hi, Kate. - Hi. So you were in outer space flying a spaceship. You were secretly trying to operate as part of the Pump plan for world domination? Yes. Look, there's a lot more that I want to tell you all. I know, it sounds crazy and fantastical, but it's the truth. - Is it? - Hmm. - Really? - [nervously] Mm-hmm. Ivanka, we have, uh... Let's get you something to eat. - [Ivanka] Thank you, Daniel. - Stop. So, uh, some stuff up there. - This is where we sleep. - Yeah. And, uh...

[Kate] Uh, yes, and also her thoughts. [Donald] Daniel wants to fuck her. I'm not getting into her head yet. [Kate] You're making shit up. [Donald] And they are fucking right now. [Kate] Donald, are you messing with me? I'll go check. But if you're lying to me, I will neuter you... [Donald] Leave my balls out of this. Oh, and she likes his big dick. [Kate screams telepathically] I'm going, you ginger-minger. [Donald] Getting hotter. Red alert! - Oh, red alert! - [Kate screams telepathically] - I don't want to talk to you. - Look. The only way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you consume, like work it out. I don't exactly have a choice of diet here, Adam. But that's what I'm saying. You can eat whatever you want as long as you exercise. I work in the indoor garden, go up and down stairs, do yoga. - What else am I supposed to do? - Do... Do whatever you want. Eat whatever you want, you look great. You just said I gained weight. I said you looked healthy, and I meant it as a compliment. But you think that emaciated pilot girl is hot? No, I don't. I just said she's pretty skinny, that's all. But you like that, don't you? - Just admit it. - Okay, fine. Yeah, I think she's super hot. So what? Oh, come on. What? Kate's pretty fucking skinny, you're not giving me shit about that. - That's different. - Why? Because she's not Ivanka fucking Pump. That's why. If... If Tom Brady were to radio us next, you... you feel good about that? Really? Tom Brady? Tom Brady is fucking dead. Everyone is dead. And I feel great to be alive right now. I bet you I look a lot better than Tom Brady does. Do you still like me? Of course I still like you. Do you still love me? I moved to California for you. Baby, I do. And did I gain weight? Be honest. - Honest? - Tell me. - Okay, a little. - I hate you. It looks good on you. Wanda! You know, sometimes ...Jesus! The best option is to lose. I mean, that was pretty bad. No, no, no. You... You... You go after her, you... you tell her you care, you tell her she's pretty, you look in her eyes, and you... You say, I love you, blah, blah, blah. I think I should just sit this one out. Maybe we just need a little space to figure things out. - I see, you don't love her. - I do. [sighs] I don't know. But you're starting to have feelings for Kate. What? No. No, I mean, I don't know. You know, it's been pretty obvious, actually. Oh, what? I don't think so. Yeah, it has. [sighs] This sucks. What am I going to do? Look, man, Kate and I, we have a way of... Of communicating so I could feel it out for you. No. No, I just... I really... I don't want to hurt Wanda. Yeah, it's a new world, so we get to make up the new rules, right? I mean, you're all fucking each other. So who's to say you can all fall in love with each other, too, right? That's natural. You know, I'm sure if you call a love line, they'd back me up on this. - You want me to call love-line? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, I mean, let me call love-line. - Okay. - Hello, love-line? I'm a male in his twenties from California, living with the last two chicks on Earth, and I'm in love with them both. - It's three chicks. - Oh, right. Three chicks. Because Ivanka Pump just showed up. And I'm in love with her, too. Now, one girl... One girl was my girlfriend before all this. But then we broke up, we're still sort of together. She's fine with me sleeping with the other chick. Just not with Ivanka, which I really want to sleep with. God, I'm not even sure if she wants to sleep with me. [sighs] Anyway, my ex, let's call her Cookie, still has feelings for me and... I think that I'm falling more for the second girl. Let's call her Cake. I mean, what should I do? Do I go for my Cookie or my Cake? Well, I would, uh, I would say that you can have your Cake and you can also have your Cookie. - Really? - Mm-hmm. I also masturbate 25 times a day. Sometimes more, is that normal? Yeah, that's right in the wheelhouse for a radiated California. But let's get back to the first question. - What? My life? - Yeah. [footsteps approaching] I can't find them anywhere. I searched the kitchen, the basement, everywhere. Oh, did you try storage? Yeah. Probably. Where were you? We were... We were in storage. I told Ivanka that we had Twinkies, and she freaked out so I took her to get some. [Ivanka] Yum. Was it good? - She enjoyed it? - I did. I hadn't had one in so long, and I was desperate. I really, really like them. I mean, I could take them in all day. I mean, I know we're sharing, but, I can really go down on those things, huh? Well, we're pleased to share all that we have here with you. Do you need to rest or take a shower? Oh, Kate, you're so sweet, but no, I'm fine. I just want to look around this place, get to know you all a little better. Well, you know Daniel pretty well already. Yeah, well, he is a dreamboat. [laughs] Oh, and I want to get to know you, too, Kate. Great. Hey, Adam, can you please go get Wanda in here? I think we're ready to begin. Begin what exactly? - Ivanka's trial. - You were serious about that? - Yeah. - Uh, Kate. Come on. I think we can just let her settle down a little bit. Oh, I think she settled down real fast already. [Adam] I'll go get Wanda. [Ivanka] You know what, Kate? I'm not a criminal, okay? I was a victim of my father and his schemes my whole life. - We all were. - [Ivanka] Yes. And I was a victim of his actions. Like the rest of you, I am a survivor, just like you. It's not my fault that I was born a Pump. Is that your opening statement? You know, Ivanka, why don't you just entertain us and yourself with this thing, and then we'll move on? I just want you to know that I'm not really for the whole trial thing. I think we should let you settle down and, you know, just talk about what you... What you know. You call it a conversation, and I'll call it the trial of the century. ♪♪ Great. Everyone's here, and the trial begins. Mi casa, your courtroom. ♪♪ ♪♪ Oh, here we go. ♪♪ Humanity versus Pump. What am I being accused for? You are a key player in the destruction of our world, and you've done despicable, harmful things to many. So crimes against humanity. That's it. Whatever. I'm telling you, I was a victim. [Wanda] So you didn't own property all over the world? Fly in private jets, eat caviar for breakfast and snort blow off the mayors for dinner. Oh, I did. But that's hardly a crime. [Wanda] They are when you earn those privileges, hurting other people. I agree, but I didn't earn them. - My father did. - Born with a silver spoon. You know what, Adam, that is really funny that you say that. I actually did have a silver spoon as a child. - It had my name on. - Oh, my God. That's hilarious. Where did that saying come from? The silver spoon thing? From people who had silver spoons for their babies. Yeah, did you know you have to use ivory spoons when you eat caviar? Because the metal ones oxidize a little... Or you could just use a plastic spoon. They didn't have plastic spoons when they started eating caviar. Well, they had wood, didn't they, Adam? Stop talking about the spoons. - Didn't you bring it up? - No, you did. No. Oh, Wanda did with the caviar for breakfast thing. But I didn't mention spoons. [Adam] Maybe you did. I don't think so. I didn't even know they had ivory spoons. Okay, everyone, just shut up about the spoons. [Donald] Caviar is so delicious. - [Wanda] When did you've caviar? - It was a wedding. What kind of spoons did they use? You know, they served it on crackers. - So tasteful. - [Kate] Stop! We're not talking about spoons or caviar or anything else that isn't related to this trial. - [Ivanka] You know what's funny? - [Kate] What's funny? The world came to an end, and a Pump is still being sued. [all laughing] [giggles] You know what's knee-slapping uproariously hysterical? Is that billions died and a Pump is still pumping. Wow, Kate, you should have been a lawyer. Oh, I'm just a nuclear physicist, I'm afraid. Yeah, mom was really disappointed, but thank you. I'm glad that you're satisfied with the court. Well, if it pleases the court, I'd like to enter my plea. Please. Plea. Not guilty. - Yeah, that's right. - Yes. Audible gasp from the gallery and reporters are scribbling away in their notebooks. Now, can we continue? Do you need a Twinkie break, Daniel? Maybe you want to help the defendant with a long cream-filled Twinkie. - Oh, I'm good. - [Wanda] Good. - Beautiful. - [Daniel] Okay. We have enough for one day? Can we wrap this all up? Is this really necessary? I don't feel good. - Oh, Katie. - [Wanda] Oh, are you okay? Wanda, can you just come with me for a second? [Wanda] Yes. Yes, of course. [Kate] Thank you. - [Ivanka] Is she okay? - It's cancer. - [gasps] Oh, really? - [Adam] Doesn't he... He makes shit up all the time. Okay, fine. I'm making it up. - [Adam] Are you making it up? - No. I'm going to go check on Kate. Adam, wait. Adam, wait. Yes, Ivanka? Do you think that I should be on trial? Um, okay, can we talk about this later? I should go, check on Kate. - Sure. - Uh, I'm... I'm very... You seem really nice. And I'm... I'm very glad you found us. I'm glad. I'm very glad you found us. I'm like very glad you found us. So... So that Adam's in love with Kate. - Is he? - Yeah. What are you talking about? He told me just before the trial. He told you he's in love with Kate? And Wanda. He's very confused. - I love them both myself. - You do? This is one kind of love fest here. Did I just walk into an STD death trap? All good. STDs have been eradicated. - Unless you have one. - No. But I do hope you love me one day, too. I already did... Do. Did... Do. Do. And Adam? Well... Does that mean you're bisexual? I'm trisexual. - Donald? - Oh, heavy petting. That's as far as it ever got between the two of us. I swear. So, um, what's a trisexual, then? I'll try anything. Do you guys do orgies? Sometimes, yeah. Orgies, uh, sort of more of a loose structure. Like, anyone anywhere kind of thing. You know? Sometimes orgies, yeah. I just watch. I'll go watch. Are orgies your thing? Not really. I'm more into power plays. Rough stuff, domination, submission. Kate's not feeling well. She went to lay down for a bit. Trial's postponed for now. Thank God. I... I didn't mean like that, I... Not about Kate. Yeah, um, well... [groans] Ivanka, how did you survive all this time? It wasn't easy. When the wave happened, I was coming back from the space mission. I didn't know what was going on, other than I lost contact with the base. So I kept going because nothing was wrong on my end. And then after I landed, I discovered all of the destruction, and I've been looking for survivors ever since. Three questions. Where did you live? How did you eat? How did you stay outside? I went to the military base. I switched planes, and then I flew to the next base. Switched planes, gathered supplies. You can go outside in the space suit. So I would listen on the radio for people, look for any signs of life. And you guys were the only people that I found alive. I'm just so happy to see you because I really thought that I was all alone. Did you ever think about what your dad did? About being his daughter and part of the Pump operations? All the time. I was a mess for a long time. I thought about killing myself, and then I decided, no, you survived. So I decided that I would go out and look for people and help in any way that I could. I thought to myself, "No, you don't have the right to die. You survived, and there might be a reason why. And you need to understand what that reason is." Now that I found you guys, maybe I'll find out what that reason is. Are... Are you fertile? I mean... I mean, how would you know. - I don't know. - Why would you ask her that? Because you and Kate aren't. So maybe the reason why she survived was to start humanity again with her babies. That's disgusting. - A whole race of Pumps? - Hmm. Come on, Wanda. I'm sorry, that's... That's disgusting. - Oh, don't cry, Ivanka. - Oh, no. No, I had fantasies about finally meeting people and that we would come together and the fight would go on. That's why I was honest with you about who I was, because I thought that maybe you would see me as I see myself, a victim and a survivor. But now I realize I was so wrong. You will always hate me, and I can never escape that. I don't hate you. I mean, I do, but I don't know you really. I hate the person you're supposed to be. Maybe that's not you any more. - I hope it's not. - It's not. I think you look beautiful. - Thanks, fat daddy. - Fat? It's all that protein you been eating lately. Yeah, look who's talking. What's that supposed to mean? Well, uh, nothing. Does everybody think I'm fat? No, Wanda, come on. You look great. - I'm in love with you actually. - What? I have a big crush on you. Just like Adam has a big crush on Kate. Uh, what? Um... - Adam? - I don't have a crush on Kate. I mean, where'd you get that from? Uh, Donald said that you said. - So... - Oh, thanks a lot, Donald. - Is that true? - Uh, no. He makes shit up all the time. - Donald? - Yes. Did Adam tell you he has a crush on Kate? No, he said he loves her and he also loves you. He's very confused. Are you confused, Adam? Fine. Okay? I... I like Kate but I love you too. Oh, you are confused. Why... Why am I confused? I've been locked up here with the both of you for ages. Why can't I love you both? What choice do I have? Oh, you can choose. Do you like Ivanka also? Yes. I like Ivanka, of course. I mean, I... I love... I love the... the floors and the... Daniel and Donald and... and the metal doors and the fluorescent lights and the gas and the radiation. I fucking love everything, okay? Also, Wanda, I was kind of kidding before, but I really do like you. And obviously, I love Kate, but I clearly have a little bit of an instant crush on Ivanka. I think that's okay under the circumstances. Well, then I'm the freak who only loves Adam, her ex-boyfriend, whom she moved to California for, because she thought he'd propose and they'd get married. Oh, God. You love her too? Go get her. [crying] Baby! Baby! Baby! Listen to me a minute. Listen to me. I was going to propose. - You were? - Yeah. Baby, come here, sit. You remember when I picked you up from the airport? Well, I had it with me when I picked you up. I just... I was waiting for the right moment, and I brought it to work with me. - You brought the ring to work? - Yeah. [Wanda] Why didn't you ever tell me? It was just in my pocket. I may... I was nervous. I liked feeling it there. You thought you'd propose to me on our first day at a nuclear facility? No, no. I had it in my pocket. I like to feel it. I was... I was nervous. Why didn't you ever tell me? Well, with everything that happened, you know, I guess I was just waiting for the perfect moment. [Daniel] I think you found it. What? Um... - We're going to get married! - [Daniel] Get the ring, Adam! Oh, my God! Oh, what? Wanda, I love you and everything, you know? But look, why get married? You know, like marriage isn't a thing any more. Oh, I love you, too. That's why. That's the reason. Oh, right, right. Okay, um, I'll get the ring. And I'll get Kate. Who is going to marry us? - Yeah, I'll do it. - I will. I officiated my friend's wedding in Carmel. I'm certified online. It's good for all of California. Oh, unless you're Jewish. Are you Jewish? No, all the Jews are gone. Actually, I'm a Jew. Reformed. I mean, my husband... Late husband was Jewish, so I converted, so actually, Jews now make up one-fifth of the population, stronger than ever. I don't think Kate would like it if you were to marry us, Ivanka. Not because you're Jewish. That's irrelevant. [laughing] [Ivanka] No, no, I get it. It's because she hates me. I'll talk to her. - Come on, Adam. - Uh, it's there. It's this way. [Daniel] Oh, well, I help you get the ring. [footsteps leaving] This is the hope for humanity, eh? You're so fucked. [giggles] Right? [drawers thud] [dry heaving] [plastic crinkles] Donald, can you help me find the ring? I'm busy. Come on. It's under the bed. [Donald] You really going to marry Wanda, eh? This is not how I imagined the end of the world. [Adam] But you're a cat, you're nimble. You can see in the dark. Come on, buddy. Donald, be a dear and go help him. - Yeah. - Oh, yes, dear. Come on. [groans] People! - [Donald telepathically] Ivanka? - [Ivanka telepathically] What? - [Donald] What do you think? - [Ivanka] I'm embarrassed. - [Donald] About what? - [Ivanka] Humanity. These choice samples. Sad, stupid, pathetic people. - [Donald] Won't be long now. - [Ivanka] Found the ring? [Donald] Oh, yeah. I've had it for days. Found it going through everyone's stuff. [Ivanka] Of course, you did. [Donald] Fun to see Adam run around looking for it. [Ivanka] Not for too long. Give it back to him. I want to see how this wedding goes. - [Donald] Really? - [Ivanka] Last wedding on earth, it'd be romantic. [Donald] Yeah, maybe not the last one. [Ivanka] Right. Not the last one. - [Donald] Let's have fun, baby. - [Ivanka] Yes, let's have fun. Give him back the ring. Is it nice? - [Donald] It's cheap. - [Ivanka] Of course, it is. [Donald] Oh, he's coming your way. [Ivanka] I'm not ready yet. [Adam] Can't find the fucking ring anywhere. I swear I hid under the bed. [Ivanka] Well, did you ask Donald to look? Yeah, I looked. He looked. We looked everywhere. Here. Might be here. [Ivanka] Oh, well, why don't you take mine? What? No. Well, I'm not using it anyway. Well, doesn't it have a sentimental value for you? My husband was a dick. So why are you wearing it after all this time? Maybe I was looking for the right moment to take it off. - This is it. - Adam. I never thought I'd see another man again. And this ring reminds me of what I thought I'd never have again. And now... Never mind. What? You're getting married. - And? - I'm too late. Oh, Ivanka. We hardly know each other really. I know what I want when I see it. - Me? - Wanda's a lucky girl. Oh! You fall right out of the sky into my arms. Well, I'm not in your arms, but I wish I was. You want me to hold you? I want you to do what you want. I want you to do what's in your heart, what's in your balls. I want you to blow the rules all to hell and make up new ones for yourself, yeah? [groans in pain] Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. [Adam] Wanda! What about Wanda? Wanda! Wanda! Wanda! All I hear is Wanda. I think Wanda wants this more than you do. - If you ever did at all. - No, I... I did, okay? Now we've spent so much time with each other. It seems like ages that we actually wanted to be together. [groans in pain] Adam, you need to make up your mind. I like strong men. I'll be in storage if you want. I hope you do. I hope you'll come. [sighs] Don't eat too many Twinkies You'll get sick. ♪♪ [groans] - [Donald] I got the ring. - Jesus, stop doing that. Where did you find it? It was under your bed, under some magazine. - Let me see it. - Yeah, not so fast, Tiny-Mighty. What? I want to officiate your - wedding. - Fuck no. Why not? Because I'm not getting married by a fucking cat. A fucking talking cat. - I'm a talking cat. - No. Okay, fine. Let Ivanka do it. Ivanka, why? I don't know. She wants to. What do you care what Ivanka wants? I mean, maybe Kate will have the honor. You know, no ring, then no ring man. [laughing] - Give me back my ring. - [Donald] I don't have it. [Adam] You just said you found it. [Donald] No, no, I lost it again. You know what? I don't even want the fucking ring. [Donald] Oh, well, you don't want to get married? No, I don't. And you know what? Fuck you and fuck this stupid wedding. It's... It's in the storage. It's in storage. It's in storage. - What's in storage? - You know, lots of things. - [Wanda] Where's Adam? - [Daniel] Does he have the ring? - [Donald] You okay, Kate? - I'm fine. [Donald] Yeah, I heard you puking. - Yeah, I'm fine. - Okay. [Daniel] We could decorated over here. Oh, we can put paper flowers over here. - We need music. - Here. Kate and I can sing. - You can't sing. - Oh, we can sing, baby. ♪ Sometimes weddings are good ♪ ♪ And sometimes they're bad ♪ ♪ Sometimes they're even worse ♪ ♪ But you still Get to do anal ♪ Okay, okay. You can sing. Just not that song. Please, not that song. Hey, Wanda, you said, Adam. You asked, where's Adam? Is that right? - Yes. - You know, he's in storage. [Daniel] He's probably still looking for the ring. - I'm going to go help him. - No, no, no, no, no. Don't... Don't... Don't go there now. - [Daniel] Why not? - Well, he's there with Ivanka. - Ivanka? - Yeah, they went there to fuck. [Kate] Oh, I'm getting so sick of your shit, cat! No, that did... they did. They went there to fuck. Just like Daniel did five minutes after she arrived. [Daniel] Whoa, wait a minute. Did you fuck Ivanka in storage? No, I... I... Okay. - He did. - [Kate] Did you fuck her or not? - Not in storage. - Yep. Oh, god. Shit. I'm going. [Kate] Is Adam really in there with her? Daniel, I hope she has AIDS. [Daniel] I don't think so. I'm never going to fuck you again. Oh, there's two men left on earth, - and she won't fuck you. - Or Adam, ever. You both disgust me. Why can't we fuck Ivanka, huh? She's a beautiful woman who probably hadn't been fucked in years. She's just dying to be touched, to be loved, to be held, to be kissed. You can hate her as much as you want, but on a human level, it's just cruel not to fuck her. On a human level, Daniel? Well, then, fuck. I should just fuck her too then. - You should. - I'd rather die. Okay, we... we hold her guilty in your... in your trial. And then what? What are you going to do? - Something bloody. - You're not a killer, Kate. I don't know what I'll do. I'll think of something. Like forgive her for her crimes and give her a second chance? Is that your dick talking? What? So now I'm the fucking problem here? - Not her. - No, no, one's a problem. We're just all in a crazy situation, that's all. No, I still get to decide something. I get to decide who I forgive and who I fuck. And what shitty cat I kick if he comes near me. Oh, temper, temper, temper. Everything's gone belly up since you've crawled in here. Are you really going to blame the broken vase on the cat? Oh, yeah. - You're so crazy. You're crazy. - Fuck you. [chokes] I'm going to fucking kill you. I'll scratch your fucking eyes out. Where is Wanda? Uh, she stormed away. I don't know where she is. After she caught you fucking Ivanka? Huh? Here we go. Yes, she caught us fucking, okay? So your fiancée ran off, and here you are with Ivanka, the tramp. Okay, enough with the name calling, Kate. His fiancée screamed and hit us and then destroyed storage and then broke a million things and basically tried to kill us. Oh, and then she stepped on all the Twinkies. Thank God, I saved a couple. And then she called off the wedding and she stormed off. Congratulations, Adam. It's a record. Shortest engagement in history. In all of history. Call the Guinness Book Of World Records. Ivanka, I'm sure you're in there too. - What for? - Biggest cunt ever. Again with the names. You know, I think would be in there, you know, as a talking cat. And I'm a talking monkey, so get over yourself. Right, but I'm bilingual. I speak cat and I speak monkey, so it's a little better. Not if I cut your tongue out. - Kate! - Wait! - [Ivanka] Kate! Kate, stop! - Kate! - Kate! Don't, don't, don't. - [Kate] Come back here. Do not hurt him. He has done nothing to hurt you. You've been here for less than a minute, so shut up. You don't get to tell me what to do. - Calm down. - Oh, everyone, - stop telling me what to do. - Okay, girl, just get a grip. You know what? Have a Twinkie. Yeah, I need to think. Yeah, I need sugar. What do you need to think about? Your punishment in the trial. Oh, my God, I'm so... Wow, we're still on that? Okay, I'm sorry. My bad. I confess. Now what? Now? You get punishment. Banishment. - What's vanishwa? - Ba... Banished! Banished! - Oh. - [Adam] What? You're kicking me out? - Yeah. - She's kicking me out. I don't... I don't think so. No. - Mm-hmm, no. - Ivanka Pump. For your past and also your current crimes, this court finds you unfit for society. You are hereby banished from Sparks. Never to return. - Just go. - Okay, Judge. So who exactly is going to kick me out? The guys or... [chuckles] Well, I'm not kicking you out, sorry. - [Kate] It's her or me. - Don't look... Don't look at me. - Daniel! - No. Okay. So it's me who's unfit for the society. I hope for the sake of humanity that there are others out there. Oh, my God. Kate, don't be such a fucking drama queen, okay? You can't go outside. You'll die. Yeah, I know. Well, I don't want you to die. I love you, Kate. And no matter how much you hate Ivanka, she's staying and so are you. Thank you, Daniel. That's exactly what I needed. Someone to come and tell me what I can or can't do. Well, you know what? You better listen... You listen... Kate, are you... Kate, are you okay? Are you... Are you okay? I'll... I'll get her some water. Um, let's take her to bed. - [Donald] The end. - Come on, guys. - Help me take her to bed. - [Adam] I'll get her some water. [Ivanka] No, help me take her to bed. [Donald] It is the end. Come on, guys. Help me take her to bed. [Donald] Really, it is. - This is Wanda, do you copy? - [Ivanka] Adam, there she is. Come on. Wanda, can you hear me? It's Adam. [Wanda] Put Ivanka on. She's not here. She's helping Kate. [Wanda] Ivanka's helping Kate? With what? Wanda, where are you? Where are you calling from? Are you outside? [Wanda] Tell that skunk, I'm going to burn down the plane. Wanda, listen to me. You can't stay out there. You have to come in. [Wanda] About to light the match. Put her on. Wanda, can you hear me? Come inside. [Wanda] I'm wearing the space suit. I'm fine. [Adam] We have a situation with Kate. Come in. - Where is she? - She's outside, I think. - Outside, how? - She's wearing your spacesuit. She wants to burn down your plane. Reason with her. Wanda. Wanda, this is Ivanka. Do not light a fire near that suit. Can you hear me? - I'll go get her. - Hurry. Okay, I'm hurrying. - [Wanda] Can you hear me? - Wanda? Wanda, it's Ivanka. - [Wanda] Ivanka? - Yes. [Wanda] I'm going to burn down your plane. Wanda, do not light a fire in that suit. There's a small oxygen leak. Wanda, can you hear me? [Wanda] Can't hear you. Don't know if you can hear me. You took my fiancé, I'll cut your wings off bitch. - Here goes nothing. - Wanda, no. [explosion roars] ♪♪ [Adam] Wanda? Wanda? ♪♪ ♪♪ [door opens] - Kate's dead. - [Adam] What? - What? - What happened? I... I... I took her to bed. She lied down. She just started convulsing. And she stopped breathing. I couldn't... Couldn't revive her, just... [Adam] Oh, my God. I couldn't. Where's Wanda? [wind blowing] [Donald] Ivanka, your... Your plane is fine. - And Wanda? - Oh, she's dead. She exploded. Wanda's dead? - I just said that. - No, Kate is dead. Oh, I know. - How do you know? - Well, she was pregnant. No, she had cancer. We hear each other's thoughts. What the hell are you talking about? You know, I say things and no one listens. I just keep repeating myself around here. How do you know she's dead? What do you want? The transcript? Okay, look, she... She reached out to me in her thoughts and, uh, said, "Oh, I need help, I'm in pain. My stomach." - Why... Why didn't you help her? - I... I was outside. I... I told her to let go. - Let go? - Yeah. I keep... Will you stop repeating everything I say with a question? It's so annoying. Annoying! I... What's going on? What happened to Wanda? She exploded herself outside trying to burn down my plane. Okay, Adam. What? No. I... I don't... I don't know what to say. Come, sit down. Yeah, you should sit down. Let's all sit down. This is a lot to process. It's horrific, but we have to keep it together now. You! You come here, and the next thing that happens is both girls die. [Ivanka] How is that my fault? It's a pretty big coincidence. Yes, but that's exactly what it is. - A coincidence. - Is it? [Ivanka] Guys, your friends just died. You can hate me and blame me later. Okay. Right. Uh, we should... - I don't know. - Well, I think we should bury Kate and Wanda and have a ceremony. You know what, I brought back one of her shoes. Wanda's shoe? You see? You see what they say? They repeat everything I say. Yeah, that's all that's left of her. That... That one shoe. I was going to marry her. Yeah, I don't think so. I was, okay? I was just screwing up my courage. Yeah, I think you were screwing up a little bit more than that. That was panic. - Okay? - Okay, okay. Yeah. Ivanka waltzes in here, I haven't seen another woman apart from these two in years. So my head starts spinning. She comes on to me, she tells me she wants to fuck me. I was... I was easy pickings. I feel ugly, used, dirty. Please! You went for it like a pig on a truffle. You need to stop blaming me for everything that's wrong with you and the world. I wanted to fuck, you wanted to fuck me and so we did. There's nothing to feel guilty about. Oh, I feel guilty. Wanda just wanted to be with me. She just wanted to... To be loved. Why did I put her through that? Kind of blew the marriage up, didn't you? - I kind of messed... - It's not necessary, Donald. What? Come on, their engagement imploded. Am I wrong? How are you making jokes right now? Okay. Donald, be sensitive, please. [Donald scoffs] Of course. Of course. I'm sorry. I'm so... I'm so sorry. Sorry, Wanda. I'm so, so sorry, really. I want to go see Kate. [door opens] [sighs] Ivanka. Guess what I was hired to do here. [Donald] Oh, run the daycare centre. - [Ivanka] I don't know. What? - [Daniel] Security. Oh, he's joking. How... How can you joke at a time like this? Security? Yeah, computers. I was, uh, sort of a hacker, hired to find breaches, glitches in software, bugs. Okay. Why am I telling you this, right? - I'm following. - I think I found a breach. A bug. - But all the computers are dead. - Like my friends. Where are you going with this Daniel? It's you. You're the bug. Brilliant. - He should get a raise for that. - Oh, yeah. You know, just think about it, Ivanka. Okay, I get it. I'm the bug. Everything... our system's running smoothly. Then you show up, everything goes crazy. The girls die, and you take control somehow. Everything starts working in your favor. How is the girls dying in my favor? They wanted you out, gone. You're dangerous. But you're attracted to danger, aren't you? Sure. - I like a little flame. - Okay. And oops, you got a little burned and now you want to cry about it, or... I want to put it out. That's all he could come up with. So far. Wow, you must feel pretty terrible knowing that there was danger around and you let it kill your friends. I feel plenty bad about it, but I'm not done figuring you out yet. Okay, smarty pants. What's my next move? You're going to come after me or Adam? What? And lose such gifted lovers? [giggles] I don't know what your end game is, but I'm not going to lose to you again. [Ivanka] No. [Daniel] I want to strike a deal. - You want me to go after Adam? - No. I want you to go after me. - I'm confused. - That's good. - Just get to the point, Daniel. - Tell me everything. I'll go away. What do you think, Donald, of our friend Sherlock Holmes here and his little deal? [Donald] Well, I'm not going to beat around the bush. - You never do. - No, I just grab it. I think he's on to something. So why don't we just tell him what he wants to know, and then he's got to go. Deal? You're in on it. Of course. I'm behind it. I'm Donald Pump. [Daniel] The cat version. No, the real thing. But you're a cat. Yes, it's a necessary temporary transition. I want to be with my daughter, you see. I don't see. This place is a dump, trust me. I mean, why do you think we're here? Because... Because of us. Because we're the... The last survivor. Right, yeah. You're the last people on Earth. That's right. We... We spent two years looking for you. We had the entire army looking for you. - [Daniel] You have an army? - Yeah. Grasshoppers, ex-marines. - Yeah. - Well, why are you... Why kill everyone? What? I want to be with my daughter. - You keep saying that. - I've been saying it for years. Oh, you want to be "together" together? We do. But... But I want it to be right. Yeah. So you're killing everyone in the world so you can be together without guilt? That's nice, it's a good thought, but I think it's maybe a little bit more than that. Good, because that's fucking pathetic. I hated the world. Didn't you, Dan? Sure, sure. It had its problems, but nothing compared to now. We could spend lifetimes, generations trying to fix it. And I'm telling you, we would fail. - Do you understand? - I don't understand. Look, the only way forward for all of us is to start over from scratch. From one man and one woman from the ground floor. And I had the plan. Don't you see, Daniel? That's my plan. My plan, Daniel. Don't you see? To push the reset button, to make it great again. [sighs] I'm so ashamed. Oh, come on. Why are you ashamed, Daniel? [chuckles] I voted for you. Oh, yeah. Thanks, Dan. - Fuck you. - Yeah, alright. You know what? We don't expect you to understand our vision. - I don't think he could. - No, probably not. It's demonic that you... You think that you've done humanity some kind of favor. This reboot of yours, what gave you the right? Your vote. [laughs] I should just kill you both. Oh, but, you know, then the army would have to come after you and Adam, and that would be the end of humanity. Do you really want that on you? It's a little more on you, really. Look, we're going to start over. A new beginning, a new chapter, whether you like it or not. Well, why not just get it over with? Kill everybody. Why all the fucking games? Well, we like to have fun. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Like a cat and a mouse. - Ah, exactly, see, he gets it. Yeah. Right, okay, so go ahead. Kill us all. Get it over with. Present sucks. The future's not worth shit. Yeah, but see, that would be too messy. You know, us killing you, it has to be better than that. - Yeah. - I'm not going to kill myself. I won't give you the satisfaction. Oh, no, no, no, no. - We'll have Adam do it. - [scoffs] He won't. Looks like you missed the bug. Oops. [laughs] Adam's with you? He does what he's told. - He's a good boy. - No. What have you done with Adam? Why don't you ask him yourself? Honey baby? Adam, what have they done to you? What? Nothing. They just... They explained things. What did they explain? [Adam] I don't know, didn't they explain things to you? - [Daniel] Yeah. - So they killed everybody. - Now it's just you or me. - You're gonna kill me? - Or... Or you me. - [Daniel] I'm not going to kill. We don't have to do what they say. [Adam] Well, we sort of do. Daniel, you can kill Adam anytime you like. - I don't like. - I mean, I would... I'd prefer that he kill you, because then the last man on earth is called Adam. Sort of like the first man on earth, right? Like in the bible, you know, circular. It's poetic. I don't know. You get it. Let's just kill them both. But that would mean the real end of humanity. The good end. Where all the evil is dead. Yeah, but then their children and their children's children, a thousand years from now, things would be great again. No, no. It'll be worse. Their utopian dream is fake. - [Donald] Believe me. - It'll never work. It'll work. It's all been carefully thought out by me. So it's going to work. I don't care. I mean, whatever. Just get on with it. One of you has got to go. What happens to the last one? - Oh, he becomes the witness. - [Daniel] The witness? Yeah, so he can see the end of the world. What do you need a witness for? - Yeah, like an audience. - He needs an audience. Yeah, no, need is a big word. I like. I'm sorry, Daniel. At this point, they have the better story, the better plan. [Daniel] So you ready to kill me? Yes. I'm sorry, Daniel. I see no... I see no other choice. And finally, the jury has reached its verdict. - Come on, Dan. - I thought we were friends. Just take it outside, guys. Come on. How are you going to kill me? With this. It's the Twinkie. It is fast. Painful, but fast. - Come on. - No. You know what? I'm glad to die. I don't want to live in this place you've made any more. It's... It... This place is shit. It's not worth living in. Oh, it's going to be beautiful. Trust me. I could never kill you. I don't know... I don't know what they've done to you. This is hard on me too, Dan. Come on. I'll eat the fucking Twinkie. Well, come on back down when you're done, Adam. We have a spacesuit fitted for you. It's real nice. Well, it's done. Zero Fucks, your master plan. Oh, it was beautiful to watch. And a new world begins, our world. We finally get to be together, Daddy. Oh, my darling. - Eat it. - Don't make me do this, man. Don't make me eat that fucking Twinkie. Eat it. Why do you want to kill me? I don't want to eat it, I don't want to make you eat it. This is hard on me, too, Daniel. Did you see her? She's gorgeous. - I'm sorry. - Come on, Adam, you're really... You're going to... You're going to kill me on no pants day? Oh, but I thought... You're going to kill me on no pants day, Adam? Don't you bring that up now. Don't you bring up no pants day. God, I love no pants day. - I hate no pants day. - What? - I like Frank whistle Wednesday. - Why do you hate no pants day? Because I have a tiny penis. I have a tinier penis than you. But Kate loves you... Your... your tiny penis, bro. - Don't you bring that up. - Tiny-Mighty! - I'll show you Tiny-Mighty. - No. - I'll show you Tiny-Mighty. - No. I'm not eating. Eat it. Eat the Twinkie. [Steve] Mr. Pump, this is Steve reporting. - Steve, are we ready to go? - Yes sir. Ship's ready to move. Well, shall we go? ♪♪ [Donald] Attaboy. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
