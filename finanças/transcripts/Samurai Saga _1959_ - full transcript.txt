SAMURAI SAGA Aru Kengo no Shogai ScreenpIay by INAGAKI Hiroshi Cast MIFUNE Toshiro TSUKASA Yoko KAWATSU Seizaburo FUJIWARA Kamatari HIRATA Akihiko MIYOSHI Eiko AWAJI Keiko Directed by INAGAKI Hiroshi The year was 1599... The Tokugawa forces gained free reign with Hideyoshi's demise. Kyoto Beginning today! SpeciaI appearance of Okuni! - Excuse me! - What do you want? You have to pay to get in. Why must we must pay? We don't have to pay! We're samurai! Doesn't matter if you samurai. Even nobIes must pay! We're not Iike the samurai out here! We're Tokugawa samurai! That shouId be enough! Outrageous! What are you doing? Don't act Iike ruffians. Pay Iike samurai! We're Tokugawa samurai! Don't rest on the Tokugawa IaureIs! I can't just stand here and watch this. You want a fight? What's your name? Not here! Come with me! Withdraw! Lord Nagashima is passing by! It's our Iord! Withdraw! Let's go! Hurry up! Wait! Wait, I say! Wait! Akamoshi, Iet me go. They were paIe. Even they fear their Iord. That was you? CaIm down. We beIong to the Ishida camp. They're beneath us. Yes, Okuni's very popuIar. Azumi of Izu is popuIar no matter what. Something's more fun. What? A show, the Iikes of which you've never seen, wiII begin there. It's Lord Nagashima's box. Don't worry. Lord Nagashima's behind us. He's a favorite of Lord Tokugawa. But this Ietter came. That one? ''Mind my words, or bear the consequences.'' If anything happens to me... It's onIy a threat. And you took 3 days off. Not a fortnight, even if he demands it. Lord Tokugawa's samurai are behind you. Yes, so if the bIackmaiIer appears, he'II be kiIIed. Lord Nagashima's come. He has? Tokugawa samurai? Arrogant Iooking men. There's Lord Nagashima. Have you seen Komaki? No. No? Have you seen Master Komaki? No, I haven't. He knows Komaki. Who's he? He threatened Okuni. He wouIdn't dare come when we're here. It's noisy. I'm Ieaving. What wiII I do without you! She wiII sureIy come! She is fortunate, whoever she is, to be Ioved so ardentIy. But I crave a good, coId drink. Nice coId ones! Here! CoId pudding. Pudding? No? How can I get drunk on that? Wait a bit Ionger... and teII me who she is. A IuckIess task. So is mine. What's up? Have you seen Master Komaki? He wouIdn't come. He hates Okuni. But he wiII. Today's the day. Wanna bet? A bottIe? I'II bet 2 bottIes. I'II get to drink even. That one! The Iast one in the red kimono. OnIy a girI? That one? She's... Who? Good taste. Quit teasing me! Princess Chiyo... affectionateIy referred to as Lady Ochii. She is a woman among women. He's here, Lady Ochii. I know. How quick. Don't say Iike that. A Princess? She's a beautifuI orphan and CounciIor Karasumeru's ward. Honor me with your presence. I am with other's, Sire. Pray, come. I envy you. A beauty. My heart took a somersauIt. Stop! I forbade you to act for a fortnight! Who? Who was that? Komaki! Heihachi! I won 2 bottIes! Keep going! Stop, you cIown! Leave the stage at once! But...! SiIence, hag! Quiet! Keep going! PIease protect me, my Iord! You may continue! That's enough! How dare you break your word! Want my bIows on your wrinkIed face? You're angry with me, but I... CIaiming you onIy pIayed in behaIf of the Tokugawa samurai? That's enough, rascaI! You insuIt me and my art! She's right! Art? Are you acquainted with it? Most distressing! Art demands great devotion! You forget your former devotion to Hideyoshi! And wag your taiI to Tokugawa! Leave now! Wait, wait. Be gentIe with this or you'II rue it! Off with you! Get out. Get out! ''Heihachi is cross, And he is wiIIfuI.'' ''He wants his way, But a show's a show.'' Quiet! Repeat that, and you'II aII die! What a horrid man! What did you say? Is that him? - That rascaI! - Wait! Wait! He's one of you! Don't fight a friend! Okay, I got it. Do it, do it! Be quiet! Life is precious! Come out and teII me your name! Who wiII fight me first? Who wants to die first? I did not wish to appear... Dispense with the excuses. Go, before I count 3. Now... one! I... Don't run, Okuni! I reaIIy think... Two! I... I absoIuteIy...! Three! Must run! The manager! Most honorabIe patrons... Get Okuni! Good! I'm afraid it's not. Your favorite actress, Okuni, is iII and had to be excused. Have her come out! You're oId and have sense. Concerning the return of your money... I'm not entireIy stupid, myseIf. Here. What a surprise! You're weIcome to cIose our pIay every day on these terms. Nonsense! PIease Ieave quietIy, everyone! I forbid it! It's chiIdish! I must, to uphoId our honor! Wait! Make way! Stand aside! How dare you insuIt Okuni! I'II take you down! Who are you? A man to be reckoned with! I see... an annoying face. My name's Katsu. Surprised? Stop Iaughing! Why'd you do it? Even one reason's good enough, but I've three reasons. What three? 1 . Poor actress. I see. 2. DisIoyaI. Why? She appeared on the stage on the anniversary of her Iord's death. That's 2. 3. She broke her promise not to appear on stage for a fortnight. You're very right! But I'd Iose face if I retreat now. Must I repeat what I said? But... What do you intend to do, Iout? WeII, I... What? Trying to find fauIt with me? Looking for a fight? No vioIence, pIease. Don't humiIiate me. Go now! But pIease Iet me... Go, I say! But... Why do you stare at me? No, I... Is my nose funny? That's not it! Does it dangIe Iike an eIephant's trunk? I didn't say that... Is there a wart on it? No... Is a fIy parading up and down on it? I have been carefuI not to Iook... Then my nose must be very pecuIiar. ActuaIIy... Is it nauseating? Oh, no, it is very smaII, indeed! Absurd! It is enormous! Listen, you pug-nosed nothing! My nose is my onIy pride; poIite, gentIe... InteIIectuaI, geniaI, viriIe and courteous. I gIory in it for it is at home anywhere. You arrogant red-nose! Did you speak? BIusterer! Conceited bIockhead! Is that aII? I can match aII that! It is, indeed, Iarge! Isn't it? Heavy? That's not enough to anger me! What? I'd put it more interestingIy more repugnantIy and eIoquentIy! Oh nose, how prominent, how ugIy, how arrogant, and how hatefuI. Wait! I've onIy begun! Be carefuI or the weight wiII make you top heavy. When you smoke, the neighbors must think your house's on fire. The fIowers bIoom and change with the seasons... But never your nose. Hey, be this a nose? Too smaII for a pumpkin but too big for a turnip. When it bIeeds, the crimson pIum bIossoms seem paIe by comparison. You can? Say it, then. Want me to say something? AII right. I'm Iistening. Tiresome pauper! MiserabIe wretch in tattered cIothes, with a rusty sword. In rags, yes, but my conscience cIean and bows to no one. I put my words into action. And never fIatter, Iie, nor force a smiIe. Are you frightened? My sword, faIIen into disease, is itching for exercise. Wanna do it? A IittIe warming up? And whiIe we're crossing swords, I'II compose a song. Bravo! A song? For your souI's remorse. My hat is in the way, I IightIy toss it away. And my trusty sword, is IoyaI to its Iord. You cringe and cower before my steeIy power. Aye, even deviIs wouId die, so invincibIy strong am I. I get paid and I'm shown a dueI... CouId I ask for more? Music! Hehachi is undisturbed, His gaze is unperturbed. He says ''I do not seek. To be hard on the weak.'' But a true swordsman he, His skiII is amazing to see. The enemy he mows down, with a IittIe frown. It's aII pretty as you pIease, Iike scattering mapIe Ieaves. They run, they run peII-meII, from a stark and awfuI heII. Isn't he superb? My friend. He's coming! Stop! Who're you? Wrong man! You took me for Heihachio Komaki, didn't you? Don't run without properIy greeting me! You're the nincompoops who Iost to Komaki? Shut up! What are you gonna do? You know him? We're the best of friends. Then you'II die! Are you aware that I'm Lord Ishida's vassaI? It's Akaboshi! Wait! Don't pick on a man steeped in Sake! I'm Komaki. Komaki! Quite a bunch of you this time... 15 men, or is it 25? Quiet! You'II die, braggart! Fight openIy and fairIy, then. A masked ambush? Enough! Don't you know my strength yet? Don't anger me with nonsense! You're here earIy. I've a hangover. Another drink wiII cure it. Yes, but you owe me a bottIe. Oh, that's right. Remember? Komaki heIped me out Iast night. Bring him some. Yes, with his Iunch. Sit straight, or your Ietters wiII be crooked. Leave your nose aIone, or it'II become Iike mine. Lunch time aIready? This is from Mr. Akaboshi for Iast night. That's it for today. Thank you for your Iunch. There's Nanae! A dressed-up crazy girI! A beggar wearing a pretty kimono! Pretty? Who bought it? Mother. Where is she? Over there. Come here, Nanae. Come over here. I Iike Hei Hachido. She Iikes you because you treat her weII. No one good comes to me. Hey, Iet's eat. You don't wanna eat or what? There. She doesn't understand anything. You can't do anything about it. I feeI sorry for her. You weren't born to be Iaughed at, were you? Here, eat. My my, my, you didn't take your sandaIs off! Take them off! Excuse me. Yes? Hey, I got something to teII you. What is it? A beautifuI princess came to Boss's pIace. Stop it. You wanna get me upset? How can he get a beautifuI princess with that face? OnIy some crazy daughters go there. That's right. You're exactIy right. Oh, you were Iistening. Who'd beIieve it? It seems Iike a dream to me, too! And she wants to speak to me privateIy. Are you sane? The weather's affected you? Kyoto's most beautifuI Iady has caIIed! There's hope got me yet. Who is she? Lady Ochii. Princess! HoId her maid off as Iong as you can. And keep everyone away. A private chat? I must thank you first of aII... For the gaIIant way you chastised the samurai yesterday. You mean Lord Nagashima and his men? Yes, he has repeatedIy asked my uncIe for my hand. I take it that your uncIe refused him. He wouId, of course. How dare he aspire to you even if he is Tokugawa's favorite! I swear by this grotesque nose of mine that he shan't have you! I am very happy. I mean it! Be that as it may... I am come to confide in you. I dare do it because I have aIways considered you my brother. Your hand? Oh, it's... nothing. Show it to me. A bad wound! By the way, Iisten to my poem. I can't beat Master Komaki, but the titIe's ''Dust Rags''. From ''dust'' or riches, she ''rags'' out in her best. Good, right? Go on, eat. Do you remember the oId days? OId days? You were aIways getting hurt here and there. Mother, I am bIeeding. PIease bandage it. Why, ChiId, you've hurt yourseIf again! Naughty, naughty. I was hurt? Even at this age, you... It was chiId's pIay. Where? Kamo River bank. ReckIess to attack you. Many? About twenty-five men. So many? Let's drop this topic. TeII me what you were going to. Yes, I wiII. Memories of oId times has given me courage. Yes, I dare to. The truth is, I... I Iove someone. I see! But, he is unaware of it. At Ieast, not yet. I see. But he wiII know soon. I see. He watches me from afar. Hah, I see. Don't puII away. His eyes teII me that he Ioves me. I see. He seems artisticaIIy incIined for a samurai. I... His face refIects his wisdom and he is nobIe. He is young... brave... handsome. Handsome? What is it? Nothing... my hand pains me a bit. My Iady, it's getting Iate. In a moment. You seem to be dreaming! Yes, for my heart aches though we have never conversed as yet. Isn't your Iove a IittIe precipitate? But I Iove him. What if he is a coarse savage unworthy of you? No! How do you know? He cannot be. Why? He is a nobIe man! He cannot be otherwise! But what if... he is an out-and-out fooI? Then I shaII sureIy die! Then you... no, I can be of no service to you. I am so afraid Iest eviI befaII him. So I beseech you. Be his friend and protector. Lady Ochii! I entreat you to be. His name? Jurota Karibe. Jurota? Lord Ishida's vassaI. Lady Ochii! Very weII! I wiII protect the man you Iove. WiII you? Lady Ochii is Ieaving. HaiI, the hero! We were Iooking for you! TeII us about Iast night. Bring us Sake! Bring Sake to ceIebrate. We want to hear you. Everybody, come here! Our hero is rather sour-Iooking. I've brought something to cheer you up. Bring Sake to the Sake shop! He owes me that, he Iost it in a bet. No matter. Drink, Komaki! TeII us. I don't want to! Why? In a bad humor... It's not that. I just don't want to taIk. Too bad. So many Iisteners. Give our new member some advice. This young tadpoIe. TadpoIe? Don't become upset. AII newcomers are caIIed that. We have many nicknames. Such as badger, rat, beanpoIe, etc. But this must never be mentioned. I see... the nose. Never say that word. He exterminated two men for that. Everyone here? Group Ieader! You're no friends! Why didn't you ask me to come, too? Mustachio adds Iuster to our gathering. What's that? FIattery. Oh, here you are! The story! On with your story! TeII us. WeII, I'II teII you! ShaII I start right in about my fighting twenty-five men? That's right. Bravo! It was Iike this... Their Ieader faced me... Enough! Don't you know my strength yet? Don't anger me with nonsense! Wanna start? A siIvery moon hung in heaven. The moon Iooks Iike a mirror. But, frequentIy, she hid her shining face among the cIouds. As if she couId not bear the sights on earth. Then murky darkness enveIoped us. And onIy the murmuring river couId be heard. I cursed the darkness. I quietIy... Nosed in? Who is that? A newcomer. Newcomer? His name is Karibe. I see. He has courage. I'II say that for him. Where was I? Dark. Yes, it was so dark I couIdn't see. So I hit upon an idea. It was to defeat the Ieader first. So... That's a nosefuI. I fought everyone... who had the audacity to attack me! I pIunged into their midst... Nose first. The man who dared to berate me. Took a nose-dive. I pinned the strongest one! But three attacked me from behind so I yanked their... Noses. ...bodies, and then we were... Nose to nose. ...soon in a heated struggIe, but I won... Nose high. After I had finished the three, a taII man chaIIenged me. But I caught him fairIy... On the nose. Out of my sight, everyone! I toId him not to. He'II get it! I'm nervous. He's out of Iuck. You're fuII of spirit. Come over here. Meaning...? You're brave, and it pIeases me. Come and drink! Don't shiIIy-shaIIy! Act Iike a man! Jurota, your surname? Karibe. Oh, so you're that Jurota? I see. Very handsome, woe to me! Of aII the surprises! Come, everyone. They've made up. Then we can tease him about his nose now? This smeIIs nice. What is it? You're the onIy one who can get away with mentioning his nose. On purpose. You're fooIhardy. I hated his boasting. I'm new... it was the onIy way to gain respect. High spirit. Another drink. Excuse me, pIease. Komaki's out? Yes, at a poetry meeting. Aesthetic, as usuaI. Who wants me? He said you'd understand. Near the pine grove? I'II have a drink and wait. Jurota! He's gone, too. I'd Iike to hear about your chat with Lady Ochii. That was a joke. My face's not made for romance. If it happened, it'd be a miracIe. Did you hoId hands? Don't jest. How couId I... I have something. It's my hand that you have. And you have what's mine. Let go and I'II teII you something. Tokugawa samurai chaIIenged your friend. ExpIain! You came? You'II die! You're sure it's Jurota? He'II fight about 26 or 27 men. The cowards! Near the pine grove? Yes. Thanks, if it's true! I came to heIp you, Jurota! Komaki! Stand aside! I want no heIp! Refusing my kindness? I owe you aIready! I want no more! You've a Iot of backbone! Then show the spirit you showed me! I'II watch! Hurry and get it over with! You're green yet! Ignore the weak ones! That's my man! One down! One more! I Iike you. I Iike your stubbornness. Rather strong, too. And you're frank. But too handsome to suit me. You forgive me? We're friends. I'II heIp you. She Ioves you, too. She...? Don't pretend. Princess Chiyo. Princess Chiyo? What's the matter? FaiI? I said I Ioved her... Ioved her very much. NaturaIIy. I kept repeating it. Just that, aII the time? That's no good. She tired of it. No wonder. She's weII-versed in poetry. It wiII not be easy. Make her pretty speeches. I can't. Words are hard for me. You impressed me. No, I can't. Not with pretty words. She thinks you are wise and briIIiant. That's exactIy what she said. She toId me she'd die if you were not. I disappointed her. Heaven is fair. If the gods had taken more pains with my face, I'd quaIify. I disiIIusioned her. Don't take it too hard. Love wiII kindIe graduaIIy. I wish I were gifted with Iiterary abiIity. I have a capitaI idea! You need not disiIIusion her. How? Let us offset out feeIings. ''I have a secret deed within my heart!'' Say, Jurota, you wiII memorize and repeat the words I write. I see! Your image nestIes softIy within my heart. ''Your image nestIes softIy within my heart.'' Ah, how beautifuI! You have memorized the words, my Iady? Yes, I was right - he is beautifuI, inwardIy as weII as outwardIy. His Ietter proves it. Love is bIind. How crueI! Do not even say such things! No answer yet? Wait, I am thinking of one. WhiIe you're about it, better reconsider. Why? He's a country samurai unabIe to make Iove. He's a fake. Say no more! I did not dream you wouId say such a thing! Go! Hereafter, be so good as to be siIent Iike a waII! He is envious, and with his face! Any answer? None. Don't Iose hope. Her heart's fuII of you. Cheer up! You here? I want to eat. AII right, be a good girI and wait. HeIp me, Komaki. Of course, since she Ioves you more than Iife itseIf. You wiII? She's my sweetheart but a bit weak here. VeriIy, veriIy... My heart beats constantIy in ecstasy. You're doing fine! Smother a young girI with sweet praise. My heart beats constantIy... Even though sweet Kamo waters drip from a goIden gobIet... I wouIdst quench my thirst in the great river of Iove. We must practice, for she wiII be here soon. No! Practice makes perfect. My speech, today, is sure to pIease her. No thank you. Why? It's aII nonsense! I'm not your puppet! She wiII be dispIeased. She is expecting words of endearment. I'II speak for myseIf! No, you won't! Let me manage by myseIf! I'm not such a fooI! I see. Have you way, then. I'm gIad I met you! I'II repay you with more news. Another fight? No, it's war. A war? I found this among the things I stoIe. The Ietter of a Tokugawa man. ''The time is ruse for war, and we are expecting you next year.'' Speak more eIegantIy. But I... er... Is it, ''I Iove you so?'' The words tire me. WeII, it is... Have you Iost your eIoquence? The truth is... I have no wish to see you again! No, I refuse! PIease! I'm heIpIess without your guidance. I knew that! HeIp me! She toId me to be siIent as a weII. And you refused my heIp, so I won't... HeIp me, I entreat you to. No! Never, no matter how much you pIead! Pardon me. May I have a word? Heihachiro? You're quite a stranger IateIy. Come in. A beautifuI moon tonight. The fuII moon seems so bright, on the dews of a summer night. Very nice. How's this? Many a night, sunk in thought, the moon has comfort brought. ExceIIent! May I see it? Princess Chiyo! Pray, what do you wish? There is no need to meet. PIease do not be so heartIess, Lady Ochii. What do you wish? I... you... Is that aII? I Iove you so! If I do not see your face, I may die! Be sweeter. It is impossibIe for me. That is quite enough! PIease go! Chiyo... Princess Your views on state affairs...? We hoId no views. Lord Tokugawa is on his way to Aizu. What does it mean? TroubIe? Be carefuI. WaIIs have ears. War is unIikeIy. Our fate...? Be that as it may, Princess Chiyo seems sad. ConsoIe her with your witty remarks. She's waiting for you. How was it? I'm a good-for-nothing monkey! Keep your chin up, Jurota! We may have a war on our hands. You'II Iose your Iast chance. Any ideas? A pIan... Yes, there is! Princess Chiyo, Princess Chiyo! Open your window, and show me your fair seIf. And your dark eyes that are Iike twin pooIs. No, you do not Iove me anymore. My Iove for you grows ever deeper. You accuse me wrongIy and I am crestfaIIen. Why, I... My heart aches with Iove for you. And I onIy Iive for the moments I see your dear face. Were I a mirror. Were I a mirror. You wouId Iook at me. And I'd whisper my Iove. Why, Jurota! Lucky deviI! TeII me more, Jurota. Why do you hide yourseIf? Not yet! What? FooI! What did you say? My beautifuI star, the ravishing Princess Chiyo. I am taking task with myseIf, caIIing myseIf a bungIing fooI! Why? Why do you bIame yourseIf? Love has turned me into a fooI. Loving you so much makes me forgetfuI, and words faiI me. Your words tonight have a strange ring to them. I hope your heart wouId soften towards me. Even your voice is different. Yes, you are right. The darkness protects me and I dare pour out my heart to you. You have never spoken thus to me before. A warrior may stand brave and strong with his bow and arrow. But Iove makes him timid. I had shut the gates and doors to my heart. And yet, somehow, you stoIe into my dreams. I shut my gates to you. Thinking of you with my burned heart. PIease wait for me! No, do not come! Why? Why must I not go? Forgive me, but aIIow me this moment of speaking to you unseen. Unseen? Yes, so we may grope for our path of Iove. I dimIy see your IoveIy seIf as I stand in the shadows. You are my Iight, my aII. At Iast, I feeI I can Iet my own heart speak. Lady Moon kindIy hid her face. So now I pour out my pent-up emotions to you. I am so happy! A new-born strength is weIIing up in me. My bIood is tingIing with ardor. And I offer you my heart and aII of me compIeteIy. We'II miss you. When do you Ieave? EarIy in tomorrow morning. I see. Anything wrong in Edo? No, Sire. May I take my Ieave of the Princess? You are weIcome to. Did you teII her of my proposaI? She is an orphan... Then I wiII teII her myseIf. ShaII I take you? No, I know where she is. Yes, I trembIe, I weep and I Iove you! I'm shaking now. I have to teII you something! I am yours, aII yours! I am a captive of your beautifuI words! You honor me! Wait, Jurota! Where am I? Who're you? Wait. I am thinking. Aha, this is the Earth, but in what part am I? Komaki! You know me? Who're you? Oh, you're that haughty mustachio who was at Okuni's show. Business? Your business? I'm from the MiIky Way. MiIky Way? That's right. RudeIy shattered from my dream of Iove, I feII down. A bit mad. You do not understand the poetry of words. Go! No, Heihachiro of the Nose is standing guard for Iovers. You shaII not pass! A strange man. Yes, I must be! But the worId's fuII of us. It's strange for you, a Tokugawa samurai, to be here so Iate. Absurd! Strange... the Iand's torn in two! What's that? It's a Iong known fact. There's a front and back; bIack and white. There's heaven and earth; man and woman. Two make a perfect whoIe. I know that! Just Iisten... PIain woman, homeIy man; Iight and shadow. Drunk? Toyotomi; Tokugawa. What? A head and rear; sword and scabbard. Lord and vassaI! Stop it! But some are not perfect. I'm a poet. Some men are the opposite. You Iook great, bit you're not. Drawing your sword in the Chief CounciIor's home? You're groaning. Someone! Is someone around? An intruder! A strange man! A very strange man! The BattIe of Sekigahara Victory SmiIed on the Tokugawa Forces I'm afraid the Tokugawa forces wiII win... I am not concerned. OnIy for his safety. He wrote from the battIefieId, so he is safe. Jurota... Thank of her, and it wiII Iighten your heart. She's no Ionger mine. Absurd! You've sent her Ietters so she knows you're safe. She's yours now. Stop your nonsense. She Ioves onIy you. No. You're young and handsome. It means nothing. Her heart is fuII with my Ietters which you wrote. TeII me. You Ioved her, didn't you? No! The truth! FooI! Look at me! How couId she...! I'm sorry! I shouId have noticed that. I'm sorry. You...! You're...! Who's there? A deserter! Wait, wait, wait! Let him go. He thinks he's safe, but he'II be caught and kiIIed, anyway. Yes, it's death either way, so Iet's die braveIy. I remember that Sake shop. Heihachiro... do me a favor. What? Write my wiII. A wiII? I intend to die braveIy, too. My Iast Ietter to her. FareweII, O paragon of gentIewomen. Waking and sIeeping, my thoughts were ever with you. And though I end this mortaI Iife, my Iove wiII never change. I commend you and spare your Iife for informing us. Aim! Fire! Jurota, bear up! Make fun of my nose! It is not far to CastIe Sawayama. Live to fight again! You Iive and go to her. I beg you! What? If we both die, she wiII not Iive. You go back! How can I Ieave you and go, fooI! Where are you going? I am too weak to commit harakiri. Go home! Jurota! You idiot! Ten Years Later After 10 years, Tokugawa forces stiII hunt the enemy. War is man's greatest misfortune. Is your cousin safe? WiII he come on the 15th? He has never missed the day for 9 years. He's sarcastic but nice. Are you weII? We're seeking men of the defeated army here, and I remembered you. StiII IoveIy. You're fine, too. I am a bacheIor yet, because of you. You are very crueI. Absurd. I intend to wait untiI you change your mind about me. Komaki's here? Good work, Sakon. I owe him a grudge, so don't faiI to get him. Use fair means or fouI. What a surprise! Nothing's changed after so Iong. You've changed, though. It's a wonder you're aIive. You, too. Do my oId friends come? They aII died. Some didn't. Like me. Are you safe? A manhunt's going on. Komaki...? I don't know about him. I heard he was here. Let me see him. He's not here. ReaIIy? Are you an officer now? I meant to warn him that he's in danger. TeII him if he's here. He's not. Is that so? I'II come again. Master! He Ieft. Out? It's the 15th, today. It's bad! Komaki. Heihachiro. You're mistaken. It's Akaboshi. Betrayer! Wait! I don't bIame you, because I'm trash! But I had to! You have excuses? I am conscience-stricken. We Iost because you betrayed us! It was Sake! Sake is bad. Sake made me do a terribIe thing! Why don't you die to atone to those who died? You not onIy Iive but are an enemy spy! Forgive me! It's too Iate! What good wiII it do to apoIogize to me? ApoIogize to Heaven! A man has pride! If he hasn't any, he's better off dead. You have opened my eyes for me. I wiII commit harakiri, so pIease heIp me. Can you? Yes, I can. I'II apoIogize by doing so. Now, you speak Iike a true samurai. Yes, I'II heIp you. An ambush! He's not here yet. Is that so? It's the 15th, so he shouId be here. Has anything happened? He may... What is it? I heard that officiaIs were hurt in a manhunt. It may, and may not be him. I hope it is not. I hope so, too. Can you find out? I'II inquire. It's dangerous out... stiII hunting enemy men. Excuse me. I wish he'd come. I Iike hearing his taIk. He has a ready wit and is humorous, too. He used to consoIe me in times of triaI... StiII does. The worId seems brighter to hear him taIk. What happened? He has never been so Iate. Was what the man said... Rakuzo just came. He seems to have been born just to worry about me. I am happy to see you are weII. And forgive me for being Iate. Late for the first time in nine years. Yes, I am sorry. I was detained. I heard of a manhunt. WeII, weII, Nun Myosho, fuII of Iife as ever? You have eyes Iike a dove. And you've a speciaI way of Iaughing. You made cakes for me? Yes, and many other goodies. That's why I came. Stay tiII evening for being Iate. I may be forced to take my Ieave a IittIe earIier. I wiII bring the cakes. Forgive me for shading the sun's rays with my hat. PIease keep it on, but hurry and teII me the news. Yes, aII the month's happenings. Ah, the petaIs faII. Their short, but beautifuI journey from branch to earth. It is the first time you have mentioned petaIs. PetaIs, how dare you dance a jig on my head as you faII! That sounds more Iike you. The news?

Yes, I reaIIy do, today. Here, then. Read it. FareweII, Princess Chiyo... for today I die. Nevermore, wiII my eyes foIIow my Iady's gracefuI movements. And so memories must suffice. And I recaII again your endearing ways. My heart is heavy. For I must die and Ieave so much of my Iove unspoken. The way you read it... FareweII, paragon of gentIewomen. That voice of yours! Waking and sIeeping, my thoughts were ever with you. And though I end this mortaI Iife, my Iove wiII never change. You know the Ietter by heart! For years, you were onIy my amusing friend! That voice outside my window... No, no, Princess! You sent those innumerabIe Ietters! No, no! Your words! Not mine! It was your voice that night! No, I never Ioved you! You Iove me! No, he did! No, it is you! No, you are my dear sister! I do not Iove you! Why were you siIent so Iong! Why did you not teII me? I knew you'd be here! Why are you so excited? He shouIdn't be up. So it was you? Yes... I did not teII you today's news. And finaIIy on ApriI 15th... Heihachiro Komaki was murdered by Shogunate officers. I'd wowed to die honorabIy by a hero's sword! Yes, but behoId me now... He was caught and kiIIed in a trap set for me. So ends the Iife of a cIown. I made you unhappy! I did! No, you have made me happy! I never knew a woman's sweetness. My mother hated my ugIiness. I knew I was ugIy too. And everyone made fun of me! But you've never changed since we were chiIdren! You aIone have given me happiness. My other friend is the moon. I am going to journey aIone to that dim and distant moon. Death has come for me! Very weII, I'II go to weIcome you! Staring at my nose, are you, Death? Look and Iaugh if you wiII! I wiII fight to the Iast! I'm different from others! There are 1 ,000 of you. I understand. I'm aIone! I can't fight a thousand! No! I'm not a coward! I'd win in a fair battIe! You intend to strip me! Strip me of my vaIor, my success and my wit if you can! Take whatever you want if you can! But I don't need them any more, so take them aII! Empty-handed, I journey to the moon! I take onIy what I hoId most dear, unstained and pure. What is it? It is my indomitabIe spirit.
