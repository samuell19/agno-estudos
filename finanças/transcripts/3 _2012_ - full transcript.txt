That's why l really can't take it - He didn't even come to drink - Bro, come here! Coming, sir! - Give us 1 packet - Why just 1? Doesn't he want 1? She gave me soup and you are giving me chickpea salad? - Soup case, are you? - l loved her for 5 years! l treated her like 'Her Highness' And she left me high and dry!! lt'sjust another soup case All girls do this Shut up!What do you know about his love? l know all about it, brother!

Flop song! Ram Come here, Ram lf you cross this sea you can come to me Come, Ram Won't you come to me? Come! Ram, what's wrong with you?! Why did you do this? l don't know l was intoxicated... So? This is how you behave? You'd do anything forJanani? - She will be happy only there! - Hey...! l thought he was behaving like that only because he was drunk So l took him to Kumaran's house And we made him sleep Everything was normal And then you both got married And Kumaran went to Singapore And then l didn't see Ram being Ram at all l spent a lot of time with him One day Ram's office faced a big loss Ram's dad was very upset He came home all tensed - Tom! Hey, Tom! - Poorthing! Why are you taking it out on him? Come, Tom...good boy, good boy l'm already in a bad mood 3.2 crores loss! Pch...Tom! Tom, behave yourself! - Tom, no! - Tom, come here, Tom! Tom! ldiot! Do you have any sense? He keeps irritating me Dude, l don't like how you are behaving That's all l can say Ram! Ram! He's dead! What happened to you? What will you tell Janani? AiyaiyO! Dude, let's take it to the hospital Hospital... He's like a child to her She won't be able to take it! Please don't tell Janani, dude What do you mean 'don't tell her'? What if she asks you where he is? l don't know! l don't know what l do when l'm angry! Help me, dude We have to do something...please What do you mean 'where's Tom'? You came here before me Didn't you see him? No, l didn't notice You didn't notice? What is this, Ram? - l was tensed about work - Tom! Tom! Where are you? Tom! Ram? Why are you just sitting there? Get up and search, Ram Tom...Tom...! Senthil? Can you please help us? Tom! Are you really searching? lt sounds to me like Bipolar disorder But l can't be sure without seeing the patient What does Bipolar disorder mean? Bipolar...as in 2 poles...2 extremes But this doesn't mean it's split personality One extreme is depression the other is mania ln the case of depression patients will be sad Loss of appetite and sleep They'll feel really guilty for small things ln fact, it might even lead to suicide ln the case of mania, they get angry for the tiniest of things Sometimes they feel happy for no reason lt's called grandiose thinking For example, the patient might even think that he l she can lift a car And they might suddenly get violent and try and beat people up They could even beat themselves up You can't really say there's a reason forthis Anybody can get this disease at any time Doctor, it can be cured, can't it? You can't say it that simply Sometimes the disease comes once and then leaves But in some patients it may repeat They need to be medicated for long Bring the patient to me and l'll check it out But don't say anything about this Say something else and bring him And l'll check it out My blood ran cold when l heard what the doctor said l thought l'd somehow tell Ram to go see the doctor l called him over to stay the night That's when l realized how dangerous he was What did you want to talk about that was so important? l haven't stayed even one night without Janani She felt so bad But she let me come because it's you Cheers! Why are you so silent? We are hanging out after so long And you look like you are haunted by a ghost lt's not that...You are a bit different these days Do you realize that? Your emotions oscillate between joy and anger You are only human if you get happy and angry, right? Right, Senthil? No, dude, you over-do it lt's a bit... What? Are you calling me crazy? That's not what l meant! You are a bit abnormal... - Abnormal? - Dude! Don't get angry... Then? lf you talk like this? What do you expect me to do? No dude...that day also, you were so violent l went and saw a doctor that day... Enough Don't say anything more - Dude, please listen to me - Stop it... No, he said something about some bipolar disorder or something - lf you come with me 1 time... - Stop it - Listen to me! - Stop! Calm down, Ram! Calm down Ram! Ram! -A man with A grey t-shirt - We didn't see anything - How long have l been like this? - For a few days...l'm not sure - Does Janani know? - No, l don't think so When she's around, you are- Dude, let's tell her about this No! What do l do now? l told you before There's a doctor l know - Let's go see him! - We will... Am l insane? Don't talk like that! lt'll be okay... Don't worry l'm scared, da l need to conduct some tests After we do that we can take the next step By tests you mean... Blood tests? Scan? No, no...nothing like that You need to answer a questionnaire truthfully And then we'll proceed When l saw the doctor's face, l realized something was wrong Bipolar people were usually violent And manic or sad and silent But he said he'd never seen anyone who showed symptoms ...of both at the same time Ram's condition was severe He asked me to somehow ask Ram to get admitted Dude, he said you need some more check-ups But he said it was best to get admitted - We should tell Janani- - No, no! Please! How will she love me if she sees me like this? She'll only be scared of me Please let's not tell her l understand...but if what happened to me happens to her next time? Can you take that? l'm sorry But l have to tell her She can't even take it when l get an ordinary fever She won't eat and she'll keep crying How will she handle this? And if l get admitted? What happens to her then? She has to look after a patient like me And go to and fro from hospital to home... Don't talk like this She'd give her life for you l know...that's what l don't want herto do Knowing that he wasn't able to control himself He was scared to be alone with you What is this, da? Ram? What is this? l took a vow to go to Sabarimalai l can see that But why didn't you tell me? lt suddenly struck me Janani, Senthil will stay with us for a week His house owner suddenly kicked him out Sorry, Janani l said l'd stay at a hotel - But he wouldn't listen - No, no... feel right at home - How's your hand? - Better lt doesn't look like you fell down from the stairs lt looks like you got beaten up by a bunch of men Senthil, l've kept pillows and sheets on the sofa for you Ram, aren't you coming in? No, Janani, l'm going on a pilgrimage, right? l have to sleep alone Janani! Leave me alone Go away...go Love, l can suffer in silence Go...l don't need your presence l'm a zombie, the living dead Let miles distance us instead All the places you touched... go, love, l've been scorched!

Love, the minutes l stayed away were meant to keep you at bay Because Ram didn't get admitted the doctorwas worried... ...that he wouldn't get proper treatment However much he forced Ram, he was unable to convince him One day, he called and gave me an injection He said l should use it if l couldn't control him My parents have come back from out of town l'll be back in an hour maximum You take care of yourself l knew you didn't like it but l continued staying at your house l had no other choice l knew you'd noticed Ram's odd behavior But only l knew how upset he was That he couldn't do anything about it He wanted to work things out between the two of you Despite Ram's protests you forced him and took him out Ram had his treatment that day That's why he lied to you ...and sent you away with some silly excuse Hello? Excuse me? l'm talking to you! What's your problem? lt's nothing, it's trivial Please leave it No, but he's very tensed about it Yourfriend only started it But it's okay...leave it What's your problem? No, it's his fault! Okay, l'll apologize - Please just go - You can'tjust indecently hit anybody Sir, your man only created the problem What did he do?

Leave me Go Listen to me Ram...! Ram realized that if you couldn't handle him getting hurt... ...you wouldn't be able to take this in your stride Even if you got teary eyed Ram would feel choked When l saw how affected he was by your tears that day ...l knew he'd never tell you Nor ever get admitted What are you looking at?
