Get a move on. Hello, Mr Mayor. - Hello, Mr Girard. - Hello! - Hello, Mr Girard. - Hello everyone. How are you? Keeping well? Hello, Mr Mayor. Hello, ladies. - Hi, Michel. - Hello. - What a welcome! - You're on the front page. Delémont will have the deputy it deserves. They love gossip. Everyone's talking about you. You don't care about the TGV and the Jura's future! - How is it? - What? The photo. Great. - Is it in a national paper? - No. - Not even a sidebar? - Nothing. But the local paper has really laid into you. - "Girard and gimmick politics." - It's hardly surprising. "He plays to the gallery but is he effective?" "Will he confirm he's standing today?" That's just a formality. Paul Girard's TGV, an electoral ploy? Well? Do you like it? The photo. You've put on weight, huh? You reckon? You seem heavier. It isn't that bad though. Bravo, Christian! It's great. Congratulations. If only I'd known! Congratulations, Christian! I did all I could. Why Fleury? He did nothing in Bern. You can't allow it, Pierre. The people are behind me. - I was powerless. - How many votes? - Unanimous. - You promised to support me. We're sick of seeing you on the front page. I embrace the modern world. I take action. We want the TGV for the future of the Jura. - Drop the bloody speech! - The end justifies the means. The TGV is not a priority. Really? Since when? These things take time. Negotiations, strikes... Our priority is the military base in Bure. Bure? I don't believe this. The Bure military base? If the base closes, there'll be 200 jobs lost. - Not to mention the revenue. - Know what, Pierre? We'll never agree on anything. Paul... 3 more years at the town hall then you'll be free. Come in, Christian. Sorry, old chap. I've got 3 months. If need be, I'll run independently. Don't be ridiculous, Paul! - Does he have a chance? - No, he's finished. - About time! - I've thought about your case. Come see. On the roof, there'll be a neon sign: Monk's Head. Everyone will see it from the TGV! What's wrong? This is farming land! Paul, you can't hold a meeting with 15 civil servants for a signature! - I'm not Mobutu. - You did for that Chink! - He created jobs and turned around the watch industry. - He's a hard worker. - I'm not asking for much! Just to extend my warehouse to store my mushrooms. - 10 m². No more. - 20. - 15. - Don't quibble! The document. - Where are you going? - I need to stamp it. You can forget about your sign. There'll be no TGV. What? It's nice of you to pick me up. - I've got some good news. - Really? - Theubet has dropped me. - You scared me. Is that all you can say? Just imagine! No more fake smiles, no more tough speeches, no more angst. Not to mention shaking dirty hands. We'll be able to breathe again. It's just an excuse. The party's nobs refuse to help the humble farmer. You're maddening, Paul! Hello, darling. You OK? The old fogies have ganged up on me. Isn't being mayor enough? I want to be a deputy. I'm sick of choosing the colour of the bins! Go mow the lawn. It'll help you unwind. The Chinese guy. Mr Liu, Julie. What does he want? Dunno. He's called 3 times. The holiday turned into a nightmare. Three bombs exploded in an area popular with tourists. A huge fire followed... That was in Bali. Why are you showing me? This tragic news is the solution to your problem. Liu, it's a terrorist attack. In one month exactly, in Bali, the Miss China semi-final is taking place. In Indonesia? That's the whole idea. They move about. It means publicity for China and for the host country. The organizer, Chang, is a good friend. He called me yesterday. And? He was totally distraught. It's understandable. You can save him. Me? Hold the event in Switzerland? Precisely! The safest country in the world. Every Chinese man's dream. I'm mayor of Delémont not head of the Swiss tourist board! Of course. But imagine for a second millions and millions of Chinese discover Switzerland. The mountains, lakes, hotels, banks, chocolate... Just think of the publicity. Your party will beg you to stand in the elections. And you'll become an international figure, Mr Mayor. Your friend... Chang. Is he reliable? Reliable? We served together in the army. That creates bonds. I don't mean to pry, Mr Jun, but what will you get out of it? I will take advantage of the event, madam, to launch my watches in China. These shows are very popular in China. Open it. - Wow! - It's the first. The Cervinia. Double tourbillon, 60 different parts, and it weighs just 1g. A masterpiece of watchmaking. It could be a huge success there. You get an international image, I get the business. - It's a terrible idea. - Why? Paul, imagine the headlines. "Girard brings his harem to the Alps." - You'll be ridiculed. - 3 days' negotiating in Shanghai then I hand the job over to Swiss Tourism. - They can go to China! - No way! Georges would pinch my idea. 15 Chinese beauties, I can't miss out on that. Just 3 days. Or maybe 4. And then, I promise, I'll be all yours. I know your promises. Welcome to Shanghai. If I may say so, Mr Mayor... Paul, Liu. Paul. Paul, you have to negotiate the Chinese way. Explain. Rule no. 1: you must never make a Chinese man lose face. "Never make him lose face." Rule no. 2: when you want to say no, you say yes, with a respectful smile. "Yes." Like that? Rule no. 3: you never ever show your emotions. No emotion at all? Always half a half-smile. Like this. It's high up. It's Chang. Mr Liu? This way. Mr Chang is expecting you. Wow! What a view! Chang is very successful. 25 years ago, we swam across the Bay of Hong Kong at night. He has climbed the social ladder ever since. See where he is now. My dear Chang. My dear Lieu. It's been years. You've done well. This is Mr Girard. - Hello. - Mr Girard. He is honoured to welcome a minister to his humble office. Just a mayor. Mayor of Delémont. Is Delémont a province? It's the capital of the Canton of Jura. A beautiful canton. Bali is a beautiful country. An event destroyed in a matter of seconds. I find it so distressing. But as we say here, "March and don't look back if you want to advance." Switzerland is very safe. Mr Girard, I'm most embarrassed. Tourism is a speciality of ours. We have 200 years' experience. I just received a very interesting offer from Australia. The land of the kangaroo! It's one big desert. - And sea. - We have lakes. It's a continent. My dear Chang, Switzerland as an advantage. It's the gateway to Europe. You're right. I hadn't thought of that. Here's a taste of what we can offer you. The Cervin, Beau-Rivage Hotel in Lausanne, Saas-Fee, Interlaken, lakes, watches, luxury, the Jura, a haven of peace, wonderful scenery, a great quality of life. In a world, an ideal life. Time's running out. It's in a month. We've plenty of practice. The UN, the Olympic Committee, international conferences every week... Mr Girard, you're a sly old fox. Are we reaching an agreement here? Yes. "Yes, yes" or "Yes, yes"? Yes. Switzerland's beauty and tranquillity... we Chinese fantasize about it. How could I pass up Mr Girard's offer? What can we expect in return? I see you have a head for business. We'll send a TV crew and broadcast 30 minutes of images of your country plus a 3-hour live broadcast with advertising slots. The slots are worth 3 million dollars. Mr Chang says to study the contract. Is it really necessary? There's a party tonight to meet the girls. It's alright. We'll walk. Reassure me, that was a real yes, wasn't it? - See how I won him over? - You certainly did! - What now? - We study the contract. The Chinese way. Alright. As my grandma used to say, "With perseverance, "drops of water can pierce rocks." - Your grandma said that? - Yes. Hello. Have a nice day. Well, Liu, how much? At least 1 million. Peanuts. Even so! Do you know Swiss Tourism's budget? 200 million. 1 million is a drop in the ocean. There are the sponsors too. Put that way... And Georges, the board's head, is a party member. They owe me that much. Then we just need the contract signed and to give Chang a cheque for 50,000 dollars. He wants a backhander? To cover the girls' travel costs. Swiss Tourism will transfer it. We can't lose face. We have to show him we mean business. - You write him a cheque! - That's impossible. - You'll be paid back. - My money's gone on my factory. You'll sell tons of watches. It's an investment. Is he really mayor? Yes. He's very important. You can trust him completely. It's you I'm trusting. Mr Girard. I'm delighted to make your acquaintance. Miss? Ting Ting. It'll be a joy for me to discover your country. You speak French. Just a little bit. I studied it at university. You speak very well. I know I'll make it to the finals. Really? Foreigners like me. No? Absolutely. This is Ting Ting, an engineer from Hebei University. Jia Li, the daughter of a big restaurant owner. It's a pleasure to meet you. Fang, the daughter of our ambassador in Sydney. Miss. Chuang Mu, our presenter will accompany the girls. Gather round. Dear friends, thanks to Mr Girard, I'm pleased to announce the semi-finals will be taking place as planned, but in Switzerland! Does it suit me? It really suits you. A real Chinese girl. I exaggerated the budget just a bit. 1.25 million. Relax, Liu. I'll win Georges over. Leave it to the expert. You'll set a new trend. After the Gulf Arab wave and the Russians, Chinese beauty is on its way! Imagine 300 million Chinese glued to their TVs. The biggest campaign ever. It's only 1%. 3 million de tourists? Think of the revenue! All that for a mere 2 million. - 2 millions? Is that all? - Georges, they can't stay in a hostel. Obviously not! I knew you'd like it. I seized the opportunity. Australia was in the running. We've other plans for China. We want to sell a modern image. We're going for design... elegance. Now... we'll be able to add glamour. Glamour! Honestly, aren't they gorgeous? I'll be frank. You were dropped for making a splash. Don't make matters worse. It's Theubet, isn't it? - We know your game. - This is different. Admit it's a good idea. Maybe, but the answer's no. What do you mean, no? - If I were you... - Sure! You'll see when you're in my shoes. "You'll see when you're in my shoes!" - Why 2 million? - Who cares! Look around you. Money isn't the problem. What about the sponsors? Nestlé, Rolex, Swatch, and so on. Say something! A snake can't eat an elephant. What? You shouldn't be too greedy in life. What's the connection? If that jerk thinks he can screw me! We gave our word. If we cancel, we lose face. - Who mentioned cancelling? - But we don't have a cent! We'll find a solution, believe me. Hey Paul! Inviting some beauty contestants? I hope we'll get to enjoy them. We'll pamper your Chinks! It's true! We only ever get local girls. This contest could take Monk's Head cheese to China. Couldn't it, Liu? We're having a meeting. Ah, right. Sorry! We won't bother you any longer. Mr Mayor's having a meeting! He's right. - How's that? - The Jura! Not with those yokels! We promised them Switzerland, luxury hotels... Everything in its own time. - Hey, René... - Paul! How much will you give me if I bring you the girls? Reasonable at last! 20 000, apples, sausage, some Monk's Head. I'll throw in visits to every producer. 932 regional products. - Pays Romand... - Land of plenty! Wake up! I'm offering you China, 1 billion consumers, your Monk's Head in the stores of Beijing! That's worth 60 000. 40. Let's shake on 50. And the association's bus for 10 days. Or I go to Swiss Tourism. OK, it's a deal. And you, Maurice, the agricultural college for the opening party. - Will the TV be there? - Yes. And the press. You don't realise how big this event is. Give us a bottle of white. It's my round. - Pays Romand... - Land of plenty! What's up? - What's this? - It's the post. That's 23,000 francs! Ah yes, it's a loan. I forgot to mention it. It's... an advance for the girls' tickets. "The girls' tickets"? Well, a paper transaction between Liu and me. He'll reimburse me. You used Julie's account, and for politics too! - It isn't politics. - Don't lie to me! You said you'd drop it without Swiss Tourism. It'll put Delémont on the map. Don't expect me to take part. You're on your own! Hello, Michel. Pretty stormy this morning. "After the TGV in Delémont, Girard's Chinese guests." "Paul Girard's Chinese antics." "The Mayor of Delémont's new whim." He's laid into me, that bastard Theubet. Forget those killjoys. I've got a good feeling about it. Mr Mayor. Hello, gentlemen. Despite the opposition, the people are behind me. I hear you've become an events organiser. No more politics? - Goodbye. - What's that gibberish? - What if he finds a sponsor? - For his circus? It's political suicide. Is Liu in his office? It's important, an exceptional event. You agree? 1 billion Chinese on a platter. Your milk and chocolate in every store in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong. Hello? What? Nestlé doesn't even want to hear about it. Not even a tour of their chocolate factory! Keep cool. Paul, they arrive in 3 days'! What do I tell Chang? We sold him luxury, the Alps... We have mountains too! "Just trust me! "A piece of cake, 2 million, 1000s of sponsors." The problem is, they're as open as a Swiss bank safe. - They'll change. - What's your plan? Once they see the girls, and newspaper articles, they'll swarm like flies. Nestlé, the sponsors and Swiss Tourism. - You want to con Chang? - You want to lose face? - A new model? - Heidi. For the contestants. He can't say we're not spoiling them. Tell me, do you think I'm ugly? What's got into you, honey? Is this a small loan too? The dress. Yes, but... all the dresses in China are the same. - And the girl in it? - Ting Ting? No way! She's 20. Ting Ting? She's elegant and slim. Of course! She won't be interested in a peasant like you! Thanks a lot! Where are you going? I need you. Dream on! Paul, isn't it classy? Brand-new aerodrome, private jet with your girls on it. - Surprised, huh? - Thanks, René. - Pays Romand... - Land of plenty! Mr Girard? Vincent Genoud, journalist on Le Matin. - Where's Picard? - On holiday. Come this way. René Solis. Monk's Head cheese is me. - Do you like cheese? - Yes. He's a trainee! 300,000 copies a day. We can't turn down a national daily! Don't look so glum. Hurry up! Good to see you. I'm René Solis. I'm a cheesemaker. I'll give you a taste. You're gorgeous! Ready? - Thank you. - There's our bus. Will we have this wonderful bus for the duration of our stay? Our host Mayor Paul Girard, will do his utmost to make your stay in Switzerland... ...unforgettable. Right! Suitcases! Forward march! They're beautiful! You'll succeed. Mrs Chuang Mu... Where are we going? Courtemelon. Is that a ski resort? Not exactly. It's an agricultural college. Mr Girard has organised everything in your honour. What's all this? We won't let you starve here. Hello. I'm Jia Li. I'll nurse you back to health! Food stocks are strictly forbidden! Strictly forbidden! - What's going on? - Who's she? Chuang Mu, the girls' chaperone. - Chuang what? - Mu. I know everything about you. Everything? Youngest deputy of your canton, at 23, member of the CDP, 1 child, mayor of the capital of Switzerland's smallest canton, the Jura. You're popular. - A real encyclopaedia! Internet, Mr Girard. I intend to win. Don't believe everything. I have enemies too. WELCOME Come on. Smile. A kiss. Great! Excellent. Careful! Véronique, Ting Ting. Ting Ting, Véronique. How do you do? Your husband, madam, is... the life... life of the party. The rose only pricks she who picks it. - You speak Chinese? - A few words Siroy taught me. - What did you say? - Women's secret. She wants to go to the hotel. The reception is starting! The girls have to change for the TV. I need a changing room. This wasn't planned. Maurice, just find them a room! Follow me. May I give you a welcoming present? Elodie, bring a few plates. Nothing like beauties to renew boudin's image. Here you go. Try it. This for instance. Ajoie sausage. Go on. Do you like it? We've got toétché too. Try it. Toétché. Siroy! Is this alright? She doesn't like anything. She says thank you. In China, it's rude to finish your food. OK! I understand. How about the sausage? Would you like to try it? My name's Jia Li. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention? Dear friends from China. Hey, girls! Come listen to the mayor's speech. Excellent! Great! I am delighted to see a dream come true at last: to welcome here the beautiful representatives of a great nation, very beautiful women who are elegant, intelligent and educated. A nation that has influenced the world with its rich culture. Dear fellow citizens, we are laying a small stone together for our common future. Long live China! Long live Switzerland! Long live the Jura! Paul! Paul! Paul! What's striking in Switzerland is how clean and unpolluted it is. The roads are wonderful. Spitting is forbidden. Newspapers are free here. Hello, madam. You have to pay for newspapers here. Momentarily, just this one time, I'll replace the tourist office. You put your coin here then you take your paper. - Alright. - Got it? Put the newspaper back or pay for it. - Have a good day. - Thanks. Well, almost free. 50 varieties of apple are grown here. The farmers of Courtemelon seek out old varieties to improve the taste. They're delicious. It's green, green, green. It's deserted because Switzerland only has 7 million inhabitants. The people are very welcoming. We can't wait to see the rest of the country. Are these the only images we've received? Girard the cheerful I'm going to be a hit. "Kuaile. Girard the cheerful." - They take for what you are. - Don't make fun! "Nothing like beauties to renew boudin's image." No doubt about it, it's of global importance. - Where are you going? - To wake up Julie. Life doesn't stop for those girls! This can't go on. Something must be done. It won't last. Where are they? Everyone's waiting. They must've been delayed. - I don't think so. - Where are they? I knew they couldn't be trusted. - What? - They've left the Jura. - It isn't chic enough. - With who? Liu, of course. - Where? - Bienne. There they are! I swear... What is this? They should be at the town hall. We sold Chang our 5-star hotels! - Seen the headlines? - The Chinese don't care. A politician incapable of finding a 5-star hotel, it's unimaginable! No sponsors, no TV! Who is this guy? - Isn't she happy? - My girls must evoke beauty not roll in the grass. Chang woke us up a 3am to give us a dressing-down. - Didn't he like it? - He won't broadcast it. Beauties picking apples... It isn't his idea of Switzerland. - What would he know? - Calm down, René. Look, the concept, Mrs Chuang Mu, had to be changed for internal political reasons. We began with Delémont, to show people traditional Switzerland, to give a perspective... ...an historical one. Now we're going to do a panorama of the country to reflect its history. And then... modern Switzerland with luxury hotels and so on. An historical approach? That's right. A Marxist view? - Absolutely. - Why Marxist? - Be quiet. - I have to change my story's angle. - Excellent idea. - Tell Chang. I'll see to it. Nice one! You think Chang will like your Marxist version? Keep him hanging on till we get the 5-star hotel. Where are we going to find the money for that? Trust me. Vincent! - Is your boss happy? - It's selling like hot cakes. He's upping the print run. Excellent! We'll keep the country in suspense and offer your paper an exclusive. An exclusive? We're holding a vote to decide the winners. The Chinese suggested it. They have traces of communism. - Huh, Liu? - Small traces. You want the country to vote? We publish the girls' pics in your newspaper and get people to vote by SMS. - I need to speak my editor. He can say it's his idea! - Yes. - Icing on the cake: 1 franc per SMS. 30 cents for the paper, the rest for the organization. Those Chinese drive a hard bargain. - Tell him, Liu. - Traces of communism but real capitalists. It's the new liberalism. You see? 100 000 votes is... 30,000 Swiss francs for the paper. It's hard to refuse. It's a good deal. An excellent deal. - I'll call him right away. - Go on. See? All it takes is imagination and patience. Chang will have his luxury hotels. And Theubet will kick himself. Pick 6 finalists My little business is a success. The people are delighted. There's no denying they're pretty. But you'll have problems honouring your commitments. That's nothing. The Jura is on everyone's lips. You'll soon be a real starlet. You know the media. They praise you to the skies then forget about you. But the party, my party, should profit from the media buzz to restore its national image. That's honourable. But what profit? Me. Is that why you here? We must go with the times, ride the wave to force our way to Bern. - Impossible. We can't go back on the committee's decision. Our priority remains the Bure military base. You want to keep Bure, do you? Alright. - You're no politician. - Just a media whore! Goodbye, gentlemen. Left! Left! Bern won't listen. - They want to close my base. - With Fleury, you've no chance. He's a major. He knows the dossier. In 2 years all he's done is renovate the station loos. 1 franc to pee at Mr Clean's. Believe me, with Fleury, you'll end up in Bümpliz. - I don't have a choice. - We always have a choice. - I'll serve them up on a platter. - Who? The solution to your problem. Girls on my base? Imagine the media coverage! In Bern, they'll look at your case. My troops with Chinese girls? No, but... my superiors will object. - On the contrary. They'll like the message of peace you're sending China. You clown around on your open day! I can't choose between you. I can't get involved in politics. Do you prefer Bümpliz? Paul... just give me time to think about it. Action and discernment, Marc. I hear Swiss Tourism is opposed to your project. It's always risky to stray from the official line. What's your message? See what we're called? "Peripheral region." The TGV dossier is gathering dust, the base in Bure is closing... The Jura isn't the 3rd World. My region is beautiful and I'll put my all into it. Do the contestants appreciate this rather original trip? I don't see them complaining! Thank you. It's gonna be a success! It'll be a success. - Come on, Ting Ting. - It's fun doing pics here. You'll have a wonderful night here. We're sleeping here? Well, yes. Aren't we pretending? No, Ting Ting. This is more comfy than a bed. Are you having me on, Mr Girard? Try it. Well, if it'll make you happy... - Goodnight. - Aren't you staying with us? No... It's more comfortable than a 5-star hotel. I refuse to sleep on that! I'll get attacked by fleas! Forget it. She's a pain. Come on. We'll find a solution. Pain in the arse! You're an arrogant rich kid. Rise and shine! Good morning, everyone! I haven't slept this well in years. I'm so happy. I've rediscovered the joys of the country. Each of the 26 cantons is independent. The Confederation watches over everyone. They even vote about the colour of bins. There is democracy at every level. It's the glue of this beautiful country built by mountain folk and farmers. What is this shit? Put it between your legs. Spread your legs like so and take it with both hands. They're taking the piss! Great! Excellent! Hold the pose. Beautiful! That's it. Great. Thank you. See you later. 50,000 voters on day 1. And it isn't over yet. 15,000 for the paper and 35,000 for us. Excellent! It's Chang. Answer it then. What do I tell him? All Switzerland is behind us. My dear Chang... That's it! Send the girls back on the 1st flight to Shanghai! But it's a huge success. I promise you, the country's behind us. Don't lie to me! Georges, the head of Swiss Tourism, has told me everything. That Girard is a fool. I'll put them in a 5-star hotel! I'm withdrawing the ads for your watches! What did he say? I've lost face. You head the figures. He'll have his hotels. I've been screwed by a bunch of yokels! Your democracy is a farce. You're a mayor with no clout, a powerless politician. - Calm down. We've only lost... - Shut up! "Don't you worry. We'll win them over, Liu." Wrong, Mr Mayor! You've won no one over. Your great pal Georges told Chang everything. Fuck! The bastard. Chang want us to send the girls back to Shanghai. Chang can go to hell! I bust a gut for his dumb contest, your watches and the Jura's future. What about me? You don't care about the girls and my watches. You're just interested in yourself and your politics. I've been had again! Fucking hell! I've lost face! - He can have the girls back. - Hey Paul! We don't want to go home. We've all voted for Switzerland. You have to do something. Sales have increased again. 150,000 SMSes. 100,000 francs for the organization. The girls should go home! We'll go back to our routine. Life will return to normal. Liu's taken them to the airport. Goodbye, Mr Girard. Right. Well, I drive Ting Ting to the airport. You can forget about becoming a deputy now, OK! Hear that? They still need me. Stay, Liu! Liu, stop being so childish. I've 932 products to sell plus my Monk's Head! What do I tell the federation? - They want to stay. - But I've lost face. Who gives a damn? Chang is my pal, a comrade in arms. He'll get over it. It's no big deal. Come on! Off we go! I'm not with you this time. Do you hear? I'm not with you. My dear Chang? Mr Girard, are they on the plane? We've decided to keep the girls here. - You've taken them hostage! - Kind of. But I can assure you they're perfectly safe. They're consenting. He intends to send the triad after you and take you to court. Ah! That will take ages. - What do you suggest? - You broadcast as planned. That was the deal. Mr Girard, these are terrorist tactics. That's for sure. If it's a failure, we'll send them home. If it's a success, win win. Mr Girard, Mr Chang will have your hide. - Well? - He's thrilled. Véro? Let me in. We'll talk when you're done with your circus! Don't be silly. Open the door. Hello, Liu. I spoke to Chang. It's sorted. We can make this work. Don't be like that, Liu! Hello China! I'm René Solis. Monk's Head, that's me! Yummy! Girolle mushrooms... that's me. "Monk's Head..." You're going to discover Monk's Head. And young Jia Li here is going to try it. Look! It's wonderful. It's fragrant. It's delicious. It's good! - That's right! - I love Monk's Head. Long live China, the Jura and Monk's Head! Pays Romand... Land of plenty! On the website, my Chinese friends, you can find all of these products! What are these figures? The phone's ringing. Answer it. Why won't you answer it? I'll get it. Come to bed! I can't sleep. Dear Chang. 320 million viewers. It's better than in Dubai. You speak Chinese now? How do you have the gall to come see me? Come on! Chang thinks you're a marketing genius. He loves the army idea. He wants the girls to stay in the Jura. How much? 320 million. Now that's a figure! A marketing genius, huh? Who was right? You. Who gave face to his pal? You again. I got carried away. I didn't mean to offend you. Sorry. Right. Let's go celebrate. It's a huge space. So after the red carpet, in the main hall, I'll set up my stands with the local produce. The gala evening isn't a cattle market! It has to be classy. What will the viewers in Geneva think? He's right. - What do I do? - Give them luxury. Absolutely, Mr Girard. What does Chuang Mu mean? Goddess of sexual pleasure. I see. Well I never. It's unacceptable. We cannot allow this nonsense. The army is a national symbol, the glue of the Swiss nation. The army's open days are to welcome fellow citizens and not to do a circus act and welcome young Chinese girls. It's impossible. Fleury has put pressure on the top brass. For Chang, it's important! He was a colonel in the People's Army. Marc's been scolded. He's obeying orders. The army serves the people. The people want the girls on TV. What are you on about? He who fails to fulfil his duty is a coward. My duty is to obey orders. Sorry, Paul. It's hopeless. - No. - It is! Damn. - And higher up? - Higher up? - If the order came from higher up? - Than the top brass? 300 million Chinese, that's powerful argument. - Good luck. - Alright? Go on, Paul! Go on! We're with you. Go on, pal! We're with you! Hey Paul! Pays Romand, land of plenty! Yes? Very well. You're putting me in an awkward position. What do you think I should do? The girls won't harm our army. I know all that. I don't follow, Federal Chancellor. No one wants you on the military base. Geneva, Lausanne, le Valais... They all want the girls. I can't upset the financial circles. And you poke fun at Swiss Tourism on TV. Objectively and with all due respect, you're out of your league. I might have a solution. A solution? You give me Bure and I let Swiss Tourism take control of the contest. Just like that? With no compensation? Depends how generous you are. Drop the scared diva number, Girard. You support our party's candidacy. You've got a nerve! Win win, Federal Chancellor. It doesn't mean you'll win. I'm being reasonable. - You're making progress. - Chancellor... It's true. It may time for the Jura to have its voice heard better than with that sluggard Fleury. Yes. And Bure military base? You're pushing it! - The dossier is at a standstill. - Alright, alright. Tell me, between us, I voted 3 time for No. 5. What's her name again? Ting Ting. I won him over! OK, girls, get out one by one. At ease. - Welcome to the Swiss army! - Don't be afraid. Come on! I was scared at first. I thought they'd be wild animals. In fact, they've been very kind. Five... six... Ting Ting, that... no. My men have been protective and beyond reproach. And as for discipline, they could teach our recruits a thing or two. Smile! Soup! Soup! Want me to feed you? - The soup... - Soup is good. Very good. They've eaten too much cheese. Soup is good. Very good. Mr Girard, your operation is a success. All thanks to the hospitality of my fellow citizens. The Chinese want more. Yet your approach is extremely original. It's strange. My friend Chang, CEO of Lotus TV, says what the Chinese admire is our sense of tradition. We stay true to ourselves despite our nation's wealth. It's a humbling lesson, a new image of our nation. Even Swiss Tourism finally came on board. Yes. Here's Mr Georges Spicher, the head of Swiss Tourism. Finally came on board? You're mistaken. There was no disagreement. We have always worked hand in hand. We've always strived to put the Jura on the map. Bastard. There'll be the classics of Switzerland: Zermatt, Interlaken, the Jungfrau, le Valais, Geneva, and a gala dinner at the Olympic Committee. Arsehole! Our strategy has always... Did you know about this? Bloody bastards. Mr Girard, thank you. And now for the rest of the day's news... You waited up? - You can be proud of yourself. - I was good, huh? - What have I done? - Nothing. As usual. Nothing happened with Ting Ting. I swear. - I don't care about her. - What is it? You negotiated your candidacy for Bern. I had to. Schmid thinks I embody the party's image. He want to take advantage of the media buzz. I'm not stupid, Paul. Are you going to go? What's Délemont done to you? What have I done for it? You're blinded by your ambition. I gave them the girls. It's what you wanted, isn't it? Wait! Hello, Suzanne. What are you doing? You have visitors. Who? It's a golden opportunity. It's the weekend edition. Just imagine! My editor thinks it's great. Picture this: "The Man of Change." Sounds good, huh? - Very good. - What do I tell him? Hey! Don't be such a wuss. You've gone global. Delémont will be happy to have you in Bern. Well? - Dropping us for Bern? - Don't take it badly. - I helped you out. - You'll have your stall. What do I tell people? They've bust a gut! It's for the nation's image! It's all about you, Paul. A true politician! You know what? You're no local lad! Did you hear that? He's had 10 days of free publicity. Do I get any thanks? Ah, the politician! - National or local paper? - Local, Michel. - What's wrong? - Just tired. "Paul Girard has backpedalled for Swiss Tourism's cash." - Set your sights on Bern? - How much? On the house. I hope to see you again soon. We've got a month, OK? The timing has to be spot on. Not a day late! Get to work. Time is money. - The orders are pouring in? - That's for sure. 10,000 Cervinia already. Not to mention the Heidi. - Are you OK, Paul? - Yes, fine. Everyone's mad at me. After everything I've done! Even Michel, who's not interested in politics. It's nothing. It'll blow over. We got what we wanted, didn't we? Not me. This isn't what I wanted. Where are you going? How do you say "lac"? Look, those girls are cute. Those three. Really cute. They're graceful. I'm Paul Girard. - Look at that jerk! - He's fleecing you. - Where's Ting Ting? - Disqualified. - Disqualified? - Fang says she lied. She didn't study at Hebei. It's a mess! She's in the lead. - I'm taking my girls. - But you signed. The gala evening will be in the Jura. - With the yokels? - The locals! And Schmid? I'm still Mayor of Delémont. He'll decide when he's in my place. Tell them to get dressed. - We'll take the mail van. - OK. Get dressed. Everyone get dressed. It's time to go. Hello, Ting Ting. My parents will never forgive me. They sacrificed everything for me. I'll never dare go back to my village. They won't want me at the factory. - Why did you lie? - I had no choice. You don't know what working in a factory is like. I bluffed like you. Like me? You promised Chang things and you pulled it off. I'm a politician. It's my job. Please help me, Paul. I'll fix everything. Do your make-up and go join the group. They don't want to see me. When you bluff, you roll with the punches and act dignified. Hurry up! My dress is too tight. You eat too much. I warned you. What? What is it? - Chuang Mu... - Yes. Will you... What? Will you marry me? Yes. Me too! Hurry up! Ambassador! This way! Good evening, sir. Saved a place for us? - Schmid? - He isn't mad. He's a friend. Politics is all about compromise. - He's sent Kohler. - Paul, you're doing a great job. Thank you, Pierre. Hello, Paul. We're proud of you. Thank you. Well done! Mr Chang, this way! My dear Chang. He's says you're shrewd. Let yourself go. We locals show our emotions on important occasions. Over here! Shake hands. That's it. Thanks. Thank you. Organizing this contest has been a memorable experience, a lesson in solidarity thanks to my fellow citizens. Thank you. But after consulting my wife, I have decided to resign from office. No, Paul! You can't do that! - A chapter is over. - We have to do something. That's all from me. To announce the results... Chang Jun, CEO of Lotus TV. I would like to thank Mr Paul Girard very warmly. Thanks to his incredible energy and his original approach, this trip has been a triumph back in China. For a feminine touch, I've decided to delegate... Mrs Véronique Girard. Good evening. The 6 girls selected for the final in Shanghai are... Jia Li, Fang, Mia, La Ni, Xu, and the Swiss people's favourite, Miss Ting Ting. Way to go! Thank you. Paul, I can't keep up with you. - Are you up to something? - Not at all! I'm quitting politics. You can't do this to me. You have my deputy's seat, I'll have freedom. Paul, you were astounding. You can't resign. We need you in the party. Our pal Pierre can take over as mayor. No. I'd never have been able to organise that. Good idea! Don't you want to be mayor? Me? Mayor of Delémont? Not on your life. Think about it. Take your time. What modesty! I thought for a sec I was hearing things. I still know how to surprise you. - Sure you're not hiding something? - Véro... Thank you so much, Mr Girard. See you at the final in Shanghai? Of course. Look after yourself. Goodbye, René. Where are you going? Isn't it obvious? I'm off to China. Good old Paul. It'll be great, you'll see. Hello, Vincent. You OK? Pack your bags for Bern. - What? - You're the party's candidate. It seems you're still needed. No. I'm through. Politics is behind me. Who'll revive the Jura? Who'll bring us the TGV? Off you go. Vincent! Wait! The idiots have finally got it. Subtitles: Eclair Media
