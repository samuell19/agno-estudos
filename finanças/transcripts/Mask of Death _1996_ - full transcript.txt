[ Suspenseful music plays ] [ Sea gulls crying ] Electronic voice: Fuck you. You're an asshole. Eat shit. Who is he, frank? He's Lyle Mason. What's his rep? He kills people. Let me give you a hand. Thanks. So, being that this is your first date with cass, I thought maybe you could use a couple of pointers. Why do you think I need pointers?Well, you're a great d.A. I mean, you're smooth in the courtroom. But when it comes to cass, you gotta throw out the book, see? She defies all rules of conventional dating. Oh, yeah? Why's that? Yeah, why's that? Simple. You treat her like a lady, she's gonna walk right over you. Treat her like a gu, and, uh -- huh. You won't score, man. [ Laughs ] You are such a pig! How should I treat her? You should treat her like a person. Thank you, Rachel. You've got class. Always the right answer. See? This is why I married her. Ooh, please! You guys are making me sick. McKenna, we've got more gear. Okay, okay, okay. I'll be right back. Okay. He's got company. Man: Who's with him? I don't know. Mr. Mason. I've heard a lot about you. You "dalillo"? Dallio.

[ Device beeping ] What's with this guy, huh? Hey! Come on, the biz is out here, all right? Something's going o. Mason's talking Russian, and dallio doesn't seem too happy about it. Relax. Everybody sit tight. Dallio: Fella, what are you, fucking deaf? Come on back out here. What's your fucking problem? Get out here! What the hell is that? What is this, my friend? A bug. They found the bug! [ Stomping ] [ Feedback ]Oww! We better move! Oh, shit! Go, go, go!We're on the move! you wait a minute! Uhh! Get on the boat now! Go!I'm moving! Don't move.Okay, okay. [ Speaking Russian ] [ Motor starts ] Jeffries: All right, return fire, but keep dallio alive. Keep dallio alive! Dallio, drive, and fast. Go for the yacht. Go for the yacht! Man on radio: No sign of dallio. We'll head back for the speedboat. Shit! Take US down there! [ Gunfire ] Other side! Take out the guy in the stern. [ Gunshot ]Aah! We're hit. Oil pressure's dropping. Take US down, fast. Dallio, head towars the rocks. Straigh! Man: Stay with them! Uhh! Uhh! [ Laughs ] Yes! Fuck you! Fuck the FBI! The engine's gonna blow! Head to shore! All right! Get an ambulance! Don't move. Okay, okay, okay. Are you guys alone? Who else is with you guys? You guys alone? Answer me! No. Yes! Dallio: All right, let's go for a walk. Let's go. Okay, okay. Come on. You too, beautiful.[ Groans ] Move! Let's go. Get to the truck. Okay, okay, okay. Freeze![ Cass, Rachel gasp ] Drop the gun. Fuck you! I'm a cop. Now, drop the gun. I got a better idea, cop. Toss your gun on the hood, or I'll blow her fucking brains out.[ Whimpering ] I think he's a little hard of hearing. Do it now. Uhh! Oh! No! Your move. Gun on the hood! [ Rachel panting ] Come on, asshole! [ Whimpers ] Okay. Good. Keys. [ Grunting ] Cass! [ Helicopter blades whirring ] Go get help. Dallio, get in the car. Let's go. Uhh! Damn it! God damn it, let me go! Just keep her off of me! I am! Stupid bitch, will you just sit still, and nothing will fucking happen?! Don't move! [ Wails ] Oh!damn it! If you just fucking sit still, nothing will happen to you! Sit down! Fucking sit down!Shut up! [ Rachel screams ] Shit! Rachel! No! [ Crying ][ Grunts ] [ Gunshot ] Rachel! That's great, dallio.I told her to sit still! You idiot! No! Don't do it! Aah! Hold it! Uhh! [ Tires screeching ] Uhh! Uhh! Uhhh! Fuck! [ Grunting ] God, I want my money! [ Grunting ] Aah! Son of a bitch! Well, Washington's gonna have my ass for breakfast. Clamp a lid on this a.S.A.P. I don't want the press climbing all over me, too. Is this your boss? Hey! Hey! Who's in charge? I'm talking to you!Just wait outside, miss. I'm a cop, and my friend is in the emergency room, and none of your guys are giving me any answers. All right, officer. Look, this is an FBI operation. Wait outside, and agent Hurley here will help you out. What's your name?Special agent jeffries. Now, will you please -- Turner. Detective Turner. My partner, Dan McKenna, is in there, and I want to see him. Look, Hurley, will you escort the officer outside and give her all the information she needs, please? Hey! Hey! Get your hands off me, all right? All right, I got it, I got it. Woman on P.A.: Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor in the main lobby. Did the local authoritis get involved? No. Two off-duty cops jumped in. That's the casualty there. What's the word, doc? Not as bad as it looks. He took a hollow point to the face, but the slug must have hit something first because it broke up on the way in. Fractured jaw, lacerations -- nothing a little plastic surgery won't fix. I'm afraid we're not gonna get anything out of Mason. Mason's dead, huh? Lost him in O.R. [ Inhales deeply ] [ Elevator bell dings ] You heard from dallio yet? Yeah, well, look, I'm at the hospital. Let me see if he's here. Orderly: What do you want US to do with this guy? Lyle Mason. A piece of garbage. Get him out of here. Mr. Mason. Mr. Mason, what happend to Mr. Dallio? Who are you?I'm Mr. Dallio's attorney. He's Dan Porter. Reps every scumbag in town. [ Sighs ] Mr. Mason, where's Mr. Dallio? Oh, no, this isn't -- this is none of your business. Get out of here. Simpson, get this guy out of here right now. Have you got a lawyer, Mr. Mason? He has the right to a lawyer, you know! Mr. Mason! If you need my help, Mr. Mason, you give me a call. I can be here! Did you see that? He thought that the cop was Mason. Yeah, he did, didn't he? [ Knock on door ] Detective McKenna? Uh-huh. Detective, uh... Do you remember what happened yesterday? Rachel. Where's Rachel? I'm sorry... But, uh... Your wife is dead. No. [ Groans ] [ Sobs ] There were two men. White males. [ Gunshot echoes ] [ Exhales sharply ] He killed Rachel. Frank dallio -- a punk looking to move up. There was another guy. Lyle Mason -- American muscle for the Russian mafia. Where is he? He's dead... Which is too bad, really. [ Sighs ] This is the situation. Dallio lucked ino something big, something worth a lot of money to Mason's employers. They need it bac. Without Mason as a go-between, there's no deal. We've got nothing. Don't worry. I'll get dallio. Perhaps. But we need more than dallio's corpse. Now, I'm gonna ask you something. Detective McKenna, what would you say... If I asked you to be... Lyle Mason? Same height and weigh. About the same ag. I've talked to the doctor. You're going to need plastic surgery anyway. Get out of here. Detective mckenn, these guys killed your wife and four federal agents. No matter how muh you hate... Your job comes first. And right now... My job and yours... Is to prevent that son of a bitch from screwing his own country. I need your help. People will ask questions. The department -- knows nothing. Mason survived, but you didn't. That's what I'll tell them. As far as anybody knows, you don't exist anymore. Until this is over, Dan McKenna is dead. [ Siren wailing in distance ] Hey, Turner. Yeah? Can I see you? The FBI denied my request for liaison. They want to handle this on their own. Sorry. Fucking feds! Jesus! Fuck! Hey, watch your language. Well -- [ Sighs ] We're just gonna have to trust the feds to bring him in. The FBI? With six months' surveillance, a team of search dogs, they wouldn't be able to find their dicks unless it was tattooed on their foreheads! Dan McKenna was my friend, too. I want these guys just as much as you do... Only my hands are tied. Yourhands may be tie. Turner! Yes? Don't make me be a hard-ass! This is a federal case. It's bureau business. Now, stay out of it! All right, I'll go write some traffic tickets, get my nails done, maybe get a facial. How about getting my hair done? Maybe I'll get my head examined! Write a few tickets. [ Machinery beeping ] [ Elevator bell dings ] Do you have a patient named Lyle Mason? Uh, I can check for you. Can you wait here for just a minute, please? It's healing nicely. Another four or five week, and you'll never know he was here. Just a little dye job and some contacts, and nobody will knw the difference. Let me see. When do I get my old face back? As soon as the job is done. That easy, huh? The doc here is a geniu. I'll check in on you tomorrow. Thank you, doctor. Now, we don't hae much time to turn you into Lyle Mason. We've got a lot of work to do. We can make you look like Mason, but now you've got to thilike Mason. Think like Mason? Ooh, that's rich. Look at this guy. He makes Charles manson look like the good humor man. He blew up a busload of kids. He was trying to kill the judge. The kids got in the way. Now, if you're gonna be Mason, the first rule is... You don't let anybody get in your way. You've gotta be ruthless. I've gotta be a pathological killer. Exactly. Hey, it's me, frank.Jesus. I brought you some underwear. Couldn't find your socks. You're all right, Tony. Yeah. So, you got everything you need now? What I need is to get out of this rat hole. Been holed up here two weeks. Every cop in town is still looking for me 'cause somebody squealed. You know what? Take it easy. Listen, things will calm down, and we'll get you out of here. Yeah, and then what? I get to sit around till this guy decides he's gonna squeal on me again? I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life hiding out, Tony. I want you to find this fucker. He's gonna pay. He's gonna pay big-time. [ Buzzer ] Lyle Mason. How'd he take the transfer to his new digs? I'm sure he loves it here. Tr17b integrated circuit, or microchip. Star wars missile technology. Bertrand moody, a gs-13 engineer at beachhead missile test center. He had a gambling problem. He owed frank dallio 40 grand. One day on his lunch brea, he smuggled out a prototype tr17b.. And never came back. Guess who ended up with the prototype? And now dallio is trying to sell it to Gregor grazynsk, who heads up the biggest organized-crime operation in Moscow. From there he'll go to the highest bidder -- people's republic, Iran, North Korea. Who knows? Where's moody now? We found him in a motel on carlsbad. Throat slashed all the way through to his spine. One of dallio's jobs. I'm gonna get that son of a bitch. This is not about reveng, McKenna. You lose your cool with dallio, and you're a dead man. We've got Mason's mony from the wreck. Do the deal. Get the microchip... And we'll take care of dallio. Open up.[ Buzzer ] Thanks. Yep. [ Buzzer ] [ Muffled grunting ] [ Grunting continues ] Get out of the way! [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshot ] Open the door, asshole! Sorry, man. Mason, come on! Now! [ Tires screech ] [ Gunshots ] Jeffries: What the hell were you doing helping that old guy up? Lyle Mason wouldn't have stopped for his own mother. You could have blown the whole operation. All right, all right. So now what? You've gotta find dallio. What would Lyle Mason do? I don't know.

I'll take care of him for you, jojo. You got a problem, pal? As a matter of fact, I do. See, a friend of mine and I were involved with the law. And, uh, well... I'm looking for him. His name is frank dallio. You better get out of here while you can still walk. Not before I see frank. Wrong answer. Oh, you fuck! [ Screaming ] You son of a bitch! I'll kill you! You asshole! Aah! [ Screaming continues ] Oh, you're a fucking tough guy, are you? Tell dallio where I'm staying. [ Groans ] Hey, Tony. Why don't you Ty some of this chicken? No, thanks. Listen, we just -- no, seriously, it's very good chicken. You should have some. I ain't hungry. This is important.Will you have a piece of fucking chicken? [ Laughing ] I got regular and extra chewy. That's the extra chewy. That's good, frank. Listen, fatso just called from the club. A guy calling himself Lyle Mason busted the place up. Said you could find him over at the sleepytime. That's impossible. Cops got Mason. Claimed he escaped. I mean, maybe we should meet him, you know. I don't like it. I mean, it sounds like a fucking setup. Could be a cop. What if the guy's still alive, you know? Maybe he does want to deal. There's a lot of money at stake here. All right. You check out his story. If it sounds phony at all, you waste him. Yeah. I'll beat him to death. [ Both laugh ] Ah, nice bananas. You find out where dallio is? Not yet. What happened? [ Sighs ] Well, I made some noise. I let his people know where they could find me. And? And nobody showed up. [ Sniffing ] [ Sighs ] [ Pills clinking in bottle ]Still hurts? So, you got any ideas? Yeah, go back to the motel and wait. See if anybody shows up. [ Sighs ] Man, I don't have the Patience for that. Where you going? I'm sure we'll be in touch. Frank. Frank! I'm starting to get the hang of this, you know? Thinking of calling this one "going nuts." What do you think? Yeah, it's nice, frank. So, what did you find out at the hospital? Well, it checks out. Yeah, he, uh, he jumped this food-service guy and ran down the back stairs. Guy's slick, huh? Yeah, he's slick. Aw, come on, frank. Let's make the deal. That's the idea, right? I don't trust the guy. Somebody tipped the cops, right? What, you think it was him? Well, I don't know. Maybe he did, and maybe he didn't. But until I find out who did, I'm gonna be slightly paranoid, aren't I? Yeah. We're gonna deal with Mason... After you find me who the fuck tipped off the cops. And when you do... [ Metal clatters ] Right? [ Needle buzzing ] Something I can do for you, friend? Yeah. I'm looking for a friend of mine who might know some of your friends. This friend of yours -- he got a name? Mm-hmm. Frank dallio. Maybe you better leave... Friend. Whoa, take it easy. I don't want any trouble. [ Bones cracking ] [ Needle buzzing ] All right! All right! I know dallio! But I don't know where he is! You got me all worked up! I'm about to lose control!

[ Sighs ] Thought you were supposed to be working on the bunco case. [ Sighs ] I thought you were giving up caffeine. Turner... I'm willing to cut you some slack, because I know what you're going through. You start sticking your nose into where it doesn't belong, and you're gonna get US all in trouble. Now, stay out of the dallio cas, or I'll assign you to traffic duty, double shift. Do you read me? Yeah. It's like talking to a brick wall. Della! I'm home. [ Muffled grunting ] Della!

So, we still got a deal? That depends. You got a bad safety record with me. Yeah, about our little problem. Wake up, you lousy sack of shit! That the guy that ratted you out? No, he ratted usout. That's why I wanted you here to take care of him. Me? Well, he's the reason you were in the hospital, right? I mean, I figured I owe you. How do we know this is the guy? Maybe we ought to ask him a few questions. Why? To find out who he knows. We know. Look, is there something wrong? I figured Lyle Mason would jump at the chance to smoke the guy that put him in the hospital. You got a problem? Maybe I want to know a little bit more about a guy before I blow his brains out! Now, why'd he rat on US? I don't know. I guess 'cause he hates my guts. Is that it? Ice him down. [ Clicking, whirring ] [ Sobbing ] I want you to tell the man why my cousin would tun on his own fuckig flesh and blood! Shut the fuck up!I didn't -- I didn't fucking squeal!

But we're taking care of that, too, aren't we? Consider it done. But what concerns e right now is this piece of shit over here. Now...you want to do the honors or not? [ Chuckles ] You're cold, man. You're gonna blow your cousin away 'cause you caught him talking to a cop? No, not just a cop. Everybody -- FBI, d.E.A. You'd talk to fucking anything with a badge on, wouldn't you?
