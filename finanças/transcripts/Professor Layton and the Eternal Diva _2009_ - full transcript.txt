It started as a game. Since then, Professor Layton has had many exciting adventures, selling 7.3 million copies to fans all over the world. Today, we visit one of the Professor's earliest, most intriguing investigations. With his apprentice no. 1, Luke. That's me by the way. As Professor Layton makes the leap from game to movie. Luke, I think I finally got to the bottom of this mystery. I can't see a solution, Professor. Now I can't...see at all. Our villian escaped through this room. But there is no way out of here. Remember, this case began with the impossible. That letter threatened that the bell would be silenced. But it wasn't the bell that vanished. It was its sound. The clue to this room was written at the tower entrance. "When the stars and planets align, you will see your way". But what's the answer, Professor? Now listen, a true gentleman must always be patient, Luke. People have long watched the stars and planets move together. So, Professor, the answer is in the stars? Yes. In a manner of speaking. But this is... And so it was that Professor Layton solved another mystery One that had puzzled all of London. Only one who could have silenced that bell, is you! Layton, you'll pay for this. Don Paolo! Luke! - Right! Flora, you stay here. - Professor! After him! - Right, come on. Once again, the Professor made the first page of the London Times. But the Professor is not just a brilliant puzzle-solver. He is also an eminent archaeologist. Archeologist, puzzle-solver, and a true gentleman. I'm Luke, his apprentice. I handle the Professor's letters requesting him to solve puzzles. I also make tea. And tidy up because the Professor never has time. My special talent is that I can talk to animals...Sort of. I have been the Professor's apprentice for a while now. I am learning to solve puzzles like the Professor. I hope that one day, I too can be a true gentleman. The one who holds the key to this mystery... Is you! Is you! Is you! Is you! Is you that I'll tidy up next. Luke, do you remember this song? Isn't that the one Janice used to sing? Yes. I can't believe it's three years since that case. Janice Quatlane was the Professor's student before becoming a famous opera singer. One day, she sent a letter and some tickets. That letter called us in to a complicated mystery, that would take all our wits to solve. PROFESSOR LAYTON AND THE ETERNAL DIVA Luke, that new instrument is Oswald Whistler's new Detragan. They say it allows one musician to play music as rich as a whole orchestra. And I must say, it is very beautiful. Not as beautiful as Janice's voice, Professor. Dear Professor, I need your help. Something astonishing has happened recently and I don't know who else to turn to. Melina Whistler, a friend of mine who died last year, came to speak to me... in the body of a seven year-old girl! I know this sounds impossible but the girl knows things only Melina and I could know. When I asked her this was possible, she told me, I have been given the gift of eternal life, Janice. Professor, do you believe this girl could really have eternal life? I don't know, Luke. But the key to all of this could be at the theatre we have been invited to. Then, let's hurry. Please be more careful, Emmy! You'd better get used to this sort of thing if you want to be Professor Layton's second assistant. Second assistant? And I'm not his second assistant! Oh, you are not? I'm his apprentice. And I am his assistant no. 1. Did the Professor say that to you? Sort of... Emmy, how is your research going? Well, it appears that it's not only this girl who was talking about eternal life. London is full of rumors and stories. They say with enough money and the right connections, you can buy the gift of eternal life. Eternal life... The Eternal Kingdom... What's the Eternal Kingdom? It's the title of the opera Janice is starring in. It's the first opera Oswald Whistler has written in years. Oswald Whistler... Whistler... I knew it! Janice's friend, Melina, was called Whistler. Oswald Whistler and Melina Whistler. Melina was Oswald Whistler's daughter. "I dedicate this opera to the memory of my daughter Melina." Professor, look! That's Dr Schröder! But of course. The opera is based on a legend of Ambrosia, the eternal kingdom. My old mentor, Dr Schröder, is an expert on Ambrosia. But the only proof he has ever found is part of Ambrosia's seal. The kingdom is such a mystery, no one even knows where it was. The eternal kingdom, Ambrosia... Continue your research, Emmy. Of course I will, Professor. What a strange-looking theatre. Perhaps it's supposed to represent Ambrosia. What is the legend about, Professor? It is said that the kingdom was once ruled by a beautiful queen who loved music above all else. The people of the kingdom adored their queen. But one day, she fell terribly ill. Her people tried everything to save her. But they did not succed. The queen died just as a remedy was dicovered. The elixir of eternal life. The people mourned the queen they had failed to save. They decided to drink the elixer of eternal life They want to live forever and wait for their queen to be returned reborned. There are those who believe Ambrosia still exists hidden somewhere, waiting for their queen to return. But no one knows the truth and the kingdom has never been found. Bravo! Professor, why aren't people clapping? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my theatre, the Crown Petone! You are truly fortunate. For tonight, you will witness a miracle. Bravo! Finally what I have been waiting to hear. I tell you it's a miracle I stayed awake this long. As was promised when you purchased your tickets, tonight, one person from the audience gathered here will receive the gift of eternal life. The gift of eternal life? It would seem that we are the only ones who didn't know about this, Luke. However, there is one condition. What condition? All of you gathered here are going to play a little game. The rules are simple. The prize for the lucky winner, eternal life. But those of you who lose will lose your lives. Lives? What's going on? You must admit this is a small risk for those desiring such a big prize. Eternal life, instant death. Well, what a twist. How ingenious. Don't be silly. We all gonna put up with this? Speak for yourself. I have only got six months to live. Yohoo! I will play your game. I will play whatever you want. This is just terrible. Let me through! Professor! Fear not. I am Inspector Grosky of the Yard. My finely honed investigation showed something suspicious would happen here in this theatre tonight. And I am here to put a stop to it. Ladies and gentlemen, no one will lose their lives. I, Inspector Grosky of the Yard, have arrested this diabolical criminal. Are you quite sure of that, lnspector? I say Layton, is that you? At your service. Who is your little friend? - Luke Triton! What the... A puppet? Professor, the roof! Inspector! Ladies and gentlemen, without further interruption, let us begin our journey to eternal life! Luke! - Coming! The theatre... - It's really a huge ship! What's happening? Does he think he can trap us? We are already at sea. What are you doing? Can you see a way out? I know what I'm doing. I am swimming back. I'm not sure that's altogether wise. Very strange. You don't often see sharks. Well, not in these waters. I can go home at last. Not even out of breath. Nice try, sharks. Where is she? Did you fall, little girl? Don't worry. Just leave everything to me. I'll play... For you, who so loved music. I want to go home! What are you doing? Someone's after our lives and you play music? We are sailing out to sea and there are... sharks all around us. Mr. Whistler, you're the one behind this opera. Tell me, did you also plan this deadly game? I was asked to compose an opera. That is all. So you say. What should we do, Professor? - Professor! Janice! I'm sorry, Professor. I never dreamed anything like this would happen. Really I didn't. Please don't apologise. Is it not the duty of every true gentleman... to help a lady in need? Oh, you haven't changed at all. Where is the little girl from your letter? I haven't seen her since this morning. I've asked Mr. Whistler, but well, he said concentrate on my performance. Ladies and gentlemen, Now we are all passengers together on the Crown Petone. It's time for our little puzzle-solving game to begin. Puzzle-solving? Game? The rules are very simple. The winner, Meaning the last player left, recieves eternal life. Professor... I don't see that any of us have a choice but to play the game, Luke. Let's begin. Puzzle no. 0-0-1 . Look around you, ladies and gentleman. Look for the oldest thing you can see and gather by it Sounds simple. But there is a catch. When the music stops, your time is up. If you want eternal life, there's no time to lose. The oldest thing we can see... Professor, let's look. - Yes. I'll come too. - Of course. That's a fish? - It's a fossil, you buffon. Professor, the ship is full of antiques. The answer could be anything here. So, which one is it? The ship is full of antiques. The answer could be anything. Look for the oldest thing you can see... I've got it. Come on. Let's go back to the theatre. Professor... Think back to what he said on the first question. He told us, we were to look for the oldest thing we could see, but he did not say the oldest thing on the ship. That's right, he didn't say that, did he , Professor? That's because the answer to this puzzle is not on the ship. Then, where is it? The oldest thing we can see... is the sky with its stars, billions of year old. Of course! As brilliant as always, Professor! Ladies and gentlemen, your time is up. The oldest thing you can see are the stars above you. To those of you in theatre, congratulations. You can continue. - Yes! But for those of you who got it wrong... Let us proceed to puzzle no. 0-0-2. Now, go to where you can see the largest crown. The largest crown... This is hardly a competition if keeps gathering us all together. There are hundreds of crowns on display all over this silly little ship. There is no way we can compare all of them in the time we have. She is right. There is no time. Maybe all the crowns are red herrings. Professor can you find the answer? I wonder... Professor! I think you should just leave this one to me. Luke? Don't worry, Janice. I'm the Professor's apprentice no. 1. That's quite the apprentice you have. The biggest crown... Crown... A crown... Now, we are all passengers together on the Crown Petone. Yes! That's it! the ship we are on is the Crown Petone! Well done, my boy! I remember seeing there was a big crown in the entrance where we came in. On the sign with the theatre's name on it. Yes. A great big one. Come on. That must be it. Professor, come on. Let's go. Is everyone else in the entrance? But the entrance is the other way, isn't it? Professor, we are going the wrong way. We have to go back. This way is fine, Luke. But... The crown in the entrance is also a red herring. He knew after the first puzzle, we would look for trick questions. He hoped once we'd seen small crowns weren't the answer, we would go to the entrance instead. But that is also a trick. But why make it so difficult? There can only be one winner at the end. So the puzzles he sets can't be too easy. He has to try and throw us off the scent. By putting a trick in the first puzzle and gathering us together, He wanted to make us think this answer would be the same. This is making my head hurt. Don't worry. You will see soon enough. Careful. Stand back. I will do it. Leave it all to me. You've done this before. I've spent some time at sea as captain of a merchant ship, don't you know. Curtis O'Donnell's the name. Come. We should hurry. Mr. Whistler. - Janice. My adopted daughter, Melina. It appears you've solved this puzzle too. Yes. Now everyone done turn up. But you said crown in the entrance was the right answer. The more fools go the wrong way, the quicker I get my hand on eternal life. And I really wish you would stop giving out hints to everyone else. Let's help. What hints? Melina, where did you disappear to? Why? Why did you bring the Professor? Melina? He musn't win this game! Are you Melina's friend or not? Please, let us have our wish. Our wish? But where are we going? We are going to where we can see the biggest crown of course. But I can't see a crown anywhere. You will see in a minute, Luke. It was you who shouted out the ship's name and yet you still don't get it? Excuse me, Miss... Amelia. Amelia, how did you come to be at the theatre tonight? Yes, a schoolgirl like you couldn't afford a ticket like that. It costs a small fortune. Amelia didn't buy her ticket. She was invited. Sadly, I lost my daughter who loved music. I wanted to give a young girl the oppurtunity to hear my new opera in her place. Of course, she has to be as talented as my daughter. I searched far and wide to find the right person. And I invited this special young girl. She is very talanted. You see, Amelia is a British chess champion. Just twelve of us left now. Well... Seems like this competition shouldn't go on too much longer before I claim my prize. You're very sure of yourself. Which is a shame seeing as I am going to win. I shall remain beautiful for all of time. This is almost an exact copy of a scene in my book. Murder on the Thames. As the hero... - Oh my. Can it really be? Wait, are you Annie Dretche? The mystery writer? Well, how flattering. It seems my work is known even amongst London's super rich celebrities. I am honoured, Mrs Raidley... I have seen you in the gossip magazines. Well well. Aren't I a lucky fellow to be in a boat with all these famous people. It gets better, that eccentric gentleman is Mr. Frederick Burgland, president of the "World Fleet" corporation. And over there a football legend, the man with the golden left leg. Pierre Starbuck? I thought your left leg looked familiar. Golden left leg... here is what's left. I need eternal life if I am ever to get my strength back. She's a bit shy. Mr. Whistler, is it true that this girl came back to life? Reborn as Melina. Where did you hear that? Nonsense. I adopted this girl. I only call her Melina as a sign of affection. But... - Janice. It makes me happy that you wish Melina was still with us. But... she is gone. I decided to carry on composing for her sake. When that man asked me to write an opera, I agree to do this for Melina, to play for my daughter's memories. But I never expected this. Professor, the ship! It was the biggest crown all along! Ladies and gentlemen in the boats, my congratulations. You've come one step closer to eternal life. Professor! Now sit back. Enjoy the next part of your journey. And hardly a hair out of place. Ahoy. Ahoy! Where is everyone? They cannot hide from inspector Grosky. Justice will prevail and I... Professor! - Janice! Have the police discovered anything about your daughter's disappearance? No. They still don't have any leads. She is a bright girl. She wouldn't get lost. Oh, why hasn't she come home yet? And could I possibly see a picture of her? Yes. Nina... Dr Schröder, does this come from Ambrosia? Yes... This is the only Ambrosian artefact we have ever found. It's a priceless treasure. Man has always dreamt of eternal life. Even today, with our technologies and medicines, We must all face death one day. That is nature's unchanging law. But of course, people have long sought a way to escape that fate. Doctor, do you believe Ambrosia still exists even now? I certainly hope so. Even if the elixir of life is just a legend, Ambrosia would be a great discovery. There are many people who want to study it in person. And we have some frightening news. Early this morning, a submarine came across bearing number of the missing audience members from the Crown Petone. The theatre which vanished last night, Singer Janice Quatlane, and composer Oswald Whistler are among those still missing. Survivors are reporting that they were all part of a bizzare game that had promised them eternal life. I have to go! But Emmy! Dear dear... Where are we now? It appears to be totally deserted. Look there! Is it? It is! I am sure of it. This is Ambrosia! Ambrosia you say... Or at least, this is where Ambrosia once was. I am Marco Brock, and I am an amateur historian. For years now, I have spent my time compiling the scrap book on the eternal kingdom of Ambrosia. You collected that? - Oh good, a history geek. Yes. This is the famous Ambrosian seal. It certainly looks like the seal. I saw it once at Dr Schröder's house. I am actually here. My dream has come true. Yes. If this really is Ambrosia... our dreams will be realized. The legend of eternal life. Does this mean... the elixir of eternal life could be nearby. What's that there? A feast? - A note. "A reward for those left in the game". Wine, eh? Good. I am simply dying of thrist. Well, I for one want my reward. A reward or a new puzzle perhaps? I don't care. I'm going to eat. This is good. Really good! This game, this island... Eating outside on the beach... Watching the sea shore here with you, Professor... It feels like a dream. Yes, these are the perfect surroundings. They even have puzzles and ruins for us to examine. Puzzles and ruins. Of course, puzzles and ruins are more romantic for you. Here. Hold it like this and you hear the sea. Except it's never really worked for me though. I hear it. - you can? That's pretty music. Sea taught it to me. - The sea? Did you hear... Mr. Whistler! Melina's just disappeared! She was there just then. She's just gone off to play somewhere. Don't worry. She'll be back soon. Ladies and gentlemen, your little break is over. Professor! Wolves! Now that you've eaten, you can be dessert for the wolves. Hurry, run! Something is wrong. They don't seem to understand me. Someone is controlling them. Janice, Luke, let's run! OK! - Let's go. I am not built for running. Then stay here. That will be one less competitor. Look, a river! What's that? A castle? Here? Puzzle no. 0-0-3. You must cross this river and reach the castle you see before you. Professor... First we have to deal with the wolves. Won't they ever give up? Professor, look! Cages. I've got it, Luke! Come on. Those cages will get us out of danger. Come on then, you silly wolves! Ready? Wait! Over here! Now, drop it! Oh dear. Oh super. Now we are the ones who are trapped. No. this is the right answer. - She is right. One, two... One, two... Ridiculous.. it was easier to place ourselves in the cages than to trap the wolves inside of them. That solved part of our problem, Luke. What do we do next, Professor? It might be ridiculous, but it works. We all have to move together. One, two... One, two... One, two... This Professor Layton or whoever he is, might actually have some brains under that hat after all. Professor, they have seen us! Let's go! Not more running, Professor. Even a cool gentleman needs to get some exercise. Into that cabin! - Right! Quickly, inside! - Janice! How interesting. It would appear our deserted island is inhabited after all. Professor, how are we gonna reach that castle? I think I have found us a way to get there. Great. We can help. There it is. Let her go! - Right, Professor. Hang on! Somehow Professor, we have built ourselves a helicoptor. That was the idea. Faster, Professor! The wolves are catching us! This is as fast as it goes I am afraid. This is like flying on a giant grasshopper! Don't you worry, Janice. You can hang on to me if you are scared. No. I am not scared. This is great fun. This is fun?! - Yeah! Look! There is the castle, Professor. I'll try to land somewhere. Hang on tight. But not to the pilot! Welcome to my castle, Professor. Ladies and gentleman, please assemble at the courtyard. So you made it. And I thought you have been turned into tasty wolf dessert. Luke... Let's now proceed to puzzle 0-0-4, As you can see, there are four doors, leading to four towers. Now look at the courtyard. Professor, there are letters here! One of those four towers contains the King's Chamber. Find the door that leads into the King's Chamber. And when you do, enter that tower. H, I, K, G... I have no idea. Just a door between us and eternal life. King tower? King? I've got it, Professor. I am certain of it. K-I-N-G spells king. Put "IN" between K and G, and so, we have to go in the door between them. That's brilliant, Luke! Luke, will you be alright by yourself for a while? There is something I have to check. But... I don't think this game is about eternal life after all. That's right, Mr. Professor Layton. Why don't you lead us straight to the answer? Don't go. Come back. Wait! Just wait there. We will come back for you. The Professor... Don't worry, Janice. The Professor will come back. What's going on? We had the right answer! It's you! Luke, do you know him? Who are you? I am Jean Descole. A humble scientist and your host on this island. And now... our little game have almost come to an end. But what is all this? Which one of us gets eternal life? What are you going to do to us, Descole? Bring Miss Amelia to me. But... Why me? Hey! What do you want with her? Leave me alone! - No! Janice! Ahoy! I'm down here! Ah, now l see. Those submarines that passed me were really life boats. Yes and with the missing audience from the Crown Petone aboard them. Most of them anyway. But you say only one arrived? I'm sure I saw two submarines escape the ship. Two? Yes, the other one headed out to sea. Of course. Hold on! So, this is where she lived. A Song of the Sea. What a wonderful view. You're the person I came to see, Melina. You... you mustn't interfere. How long have you been living here? I was... I was very ill. My father brought me here. He thought the air would be good for me. That's why I'm so much better. Better? Why would you be better? You told Janice you had been reborn with the gift of eternal life. I was... I was reborn. I was ill. I died and then I... I didn't die! He is not my daddy! He brought me here. He didn't. Quiet. He will find out. But... Melina. - I am not Melina. Yes I am. No! I want to go home! Stop it! Stop it! Of course. This way! - Right! All right, all right! No, not my scrap book! I'll protect you from them, Janice! - Luke! Emmy? Sorry I'm late, second assistant! Apprentice no. 1! I'm Grosky of the Yard and you're all under arrest! Are you all right? Professor Layton! Nina! Nina? Your mommy and daddy sent me. Can I go home now? Yes. They are frightfully worried. They miss you. Professor, Descole has Amelia! I know. Janice, let's finish this. Yes. Have we come to the end? Everything is going according to plan as I told you it would do. You kidnapped people. You sold all those tickets. That's no plan. That was my plan. Mr. Whistler. So, you were involved in all this. Come come, Amelia. Everything's OK. Where are the others? Why am I here alone? Because you are the winner. You will receive eternal life! What is this? - The Detragan. We brought it from the ship. This beautiful instrument does not just play music, Amelia. It will also give the gift you crave of eternal life. And it was me who created it. Quickly, Amelia. This way. - Wait! But I don't want eternal life. I want to give it to my grandad. He only has a month to live. He should be here. He has to drink the elixir of life. There is no elixir. Leave me alone! Let me go! Let me go! Please, don't! Please, Mr. Whistler! Enough! Are you OK? Mr. Whistler, I have deduced, you never intended to give eternal life to the winner. On the contrary, You were intending to steal their life. Take it away from them. That is just not true. I've finally discovered the truth. The awful truth behind this game. What is it, Professor? One year ago, when Melina was dying, or rather, because she was dying, you put a vast sum of money to building this Detragan. And assisting you was the scientist, Jean Descole. But the Detragan is no ordinary instrument. It is a machine that can copy a person's personality, their memory all into another person's brain. What? - A copy? Is that possible? Unfortunately, the results weren't perfect. The person's real personality, their memories would force the copy back out of their mind. Nina here showed me that. Tell me again that person who you were talking to before. It was Melina. You knew Nina's memories were returning. That Melina would be lost without another host. You needed a subject with a brain that would accept Melina. This is why you invited gifted young girls like Amelia. I am sure the game for eternal life was Descole's idea. So, all you wished was to copy Melina's memories, to keep her alive forever. Very impressive, Layton. When did you realise I was involved? I suspected it for a while and my suspicion were confirmed when I saw this gloomy castle. Then I knew it must be you orchestrating this plot, Descole. This one will have to do! I can't let her memories fade. There is no time. No time! What? Who took the key? Who took it? Layton, was it you? Give it back! The Detragan can't hold her memories much longer. She will disappear forever! Please, calm yourself. I know who has the key. That person holds the key to the Detragan and to explain all the mysteries in this case, They know everything you have done. Who is it? You haven't guessed? They hid themselves carefully, to save you from your mistakes. So, who is it then, Professor? It is you! Janice? I think it is time to tell us everything, Janice. Or should I say... Melina! You are right. I am Melina. You thought putting my memories into Janice had failed but it hadn't. Janice allowed me to stay here to my very great surprise. She buried her personailty voluntarily, so that I couId act in her place. I had been ill for so long... Now, I could walk and dance and sing. Then, I didn't need anyone else. Congratulations, Whistler. We've accomplished our objective. As the time went by, I came to realize how wrong this is. I can't steal another's life so I could live my own. So, you sent me that letter? Yes. Janice told me you were the right man, Professor. You were the only hope of stopping my father. No. I can't take other people's lives. But I knew while father had that machine, that he would never let me go. Melina... Janice has told me so many great things about you, Professor. She is very very fond of you indeed. Melina, all I did... It was all for you! Thank you, father. Thank you for your love. But these. This all has to stop. How could I possibly keep on living without you here with me? Tell me. Professor! The roof! What the? Melina! What are you doing, Descole? l'm afraid I need this young lady's voice if I am to accomplish my real goal here. What are you planning? To bring Ambrosia back to life! The legend of Ambrosians fades but it was I who discovered the complete seal. Layton, do you know what the lines around that symbol mean? Their music. That is correct. Ambrosian music. That seal is the first key to unlocking Ambrosia. It is A Song of the Stars. Of the stars? The second key is you, Melina. What? How can I be a key? The Ambrosian seal hides not one key but two of them. Two songs that resonate in perfect harmony. A Song of the Stars and the sea. A Song of the Sea... When two songs are played together here, Ambrosia will rise once more. How could I not see it? All he ever wanted was the Ambrosia kingdom. Just as I cracked the code, the one person, who knew A Song of the Sea, the other key I needed, could no longer sing it. But her memories remained. All I needed was someone to bring those memories alive. Janice! Luke! Watch out, Professor. Stop it! You must sing if you want to save them, Melina. This is your farewell performance. Sing Melina. Sing A Song of the Sea. Sing, Melina! Are you all right? Ambrosia will rise again! Run everyone. Run! Luke! - Yes! Professor! Why? Why won't it rise? Again. Sing it. Sing! Of course! Why... Why? Well... If the door to Ambrosia will not open by this music, I will tear it down! What is that thing? - It's terrible! What is Descole trying to do? Ambrosia shall be mine. Melina! Melina! - Mr. Whistler! Please someone save Melina... There is a way to save her. Emmy, stay here. Luke, with me. Coming! Rise, Ambrosia. Give me your secrets. I command you. Show yourself! Layton? You think you can stop me with that contraption? Melina! I warned you not to get in my way. Stop it! Get out of my way. Professor, I can save her! It's too dangerous! Professor, I have to do something. After all... I want to be a true gentIeman! Then I am counting on you. - Ready! We can't go any higher. - I will make it. Hang on there, Melina. I am coming for you. Luke Triton... Time to be rid of you. Melina! Luke! Professor! I told you not to get in my way. You just keep coming back. Thank you, Luke. Forget it. It was nothing, Melina. Too slow. You think so, Descole? The Ambrosian seal. - What? You only solved part of the puzzle. What are you talking about? You found the songs of the sea and the stars. The seal shows not two songs but three, Descole. You cannot raise Ambrosia unless you look at the pattern another way. If you turn the seal upside down, another melody appears. The sun. - Yes. The final key is... A Song of the Sun. Without that song, Ambrosia will never appear, Descole. Melina, sing A Song of the Sea. - Yes! Layton! Ambrosia is mine and mine alone. Descole! Professor! Professor... I say, that thing looks as if it's going to explode. We have to help them. Professor, what do we do? Time to go, Luke. Melina. Melina! You alright? - Melina... Melina! Melina... Melina. Melina... Father? - Melina! Please don't ever scare me like that again. I miss you so much. Never leave me, Melina. Let's go home. We'll play piano the together. We'll have so much time. We will play every day... I'm sorry. Dear father, I have only ever brought you grief and sadness, haven't I? No. You are my only joy and I couldn't save you. It was fate. There was nothing you could do. But I... Listen to me. You have to start a new life. I don't want a new life! I cannot stay here. But even if I am gone, dear father, I will still live on in your memory. Even though you won't see me, I will always be with you. Don't talk like that, please. Melina... Father, do you remember what you used to say, when you left for a concert? "No matter..." " No matter how far I am from you," "wherever I go, you will always be in my heart ." Father, no matter how far I go, I will always be in your heart. Whenever you remember me, I'll always be there. I must go now, father. Thank you for loving me. I have to go. Janice, I am sorry to have borrowed you body for so long. Don't go Melina. You can stay. Don't worry. It's best for everyone that I go now. I'm so glad you treasured the special pendant that I left you. Melina! Farewell. Janice, it's time for you to start living your own life again. Farewell, Father. Melina... Farewell, Luke. Apprentice no. 1. Melina... And farewell, Professor Layton. Melina... I am so glad that all of you were my very last memory. Melina? Professor, Melina has left us. Is there no way to get her back? Now listen to me, Janice. Melina hasn't gone. Luke! If you remember her, she will always be here. That is what she said to us. That is right, isn't it, Professor? Yes. Remember her for always. I will remember as well. Mr. Whistler. I am afraid I must arrest you. Please, let me play one last song. So, the secret of Ambrosia was not eternal life. The Ambrosians live forever because we remember their beloved queen. So, that's it. And another mystery has been solved. Professor, do you think Melina could have been a reincarnation of the queen of Ambrosia? I think she might have been, Luke. The legend was said the kingdom would arise once more when its beloved queen returned.
