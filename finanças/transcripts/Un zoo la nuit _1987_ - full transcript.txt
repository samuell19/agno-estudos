We're waiting for you. We're even sending a little present... right to your cell door... just to show you we're still here. We tried to get Brigitte Bardot, but she couldn't make it. Anyway, we did our best. A present for you, Stick. Somebody sent you a singing telegram. Marcel! Forcier, Gratton, Marcel Brisebois. He already left. They told me he'd be out at nine. I called twice. It's only 7:30. Now I remember. The musician who carries a little piano around with him. He left a while ago. You sure? Sir, it's written here: Brisebois. Released at 6:05. You were early, though. What's an hour when you've been waiting two years? You his father? Sometimes I wonder. The bloody machine! I waited all day for you. I know you're there, home from your trip. I even went to the airport this morning to pick you up. Coffee. They're all the same. Princesses. Want you to beg for it before you fuck 'em. Not worth the trouble. The ketchup. Gimme the ketchup, handsome. That'll do. You can shove your goddamn sandwich. What's eating you, fuckhead? Calm down! Calm down! Say '' ah'' . I said say '' ah'' . You slime! Probably buying it off pimple-faced boys! See this? - Calm down! Your goon was big like this! Got you scared, huh? Happy birthday, son. Are you getting your calls and your mail? I must be crazy to love you like this. Why won't you let me visit? They closed down the shop. I'm out of work. This is a message for the lady of the house... It was August 15th. It was hot, I couldn't sleep. I touched myself, thinking of you, calling you in the dark. Spent the day getting in your mother's way. We really miss you. It's stupid! I can't wait if you're not even gonna see me! Your father's driving me nuts! Hi, Stick. Still getting your messages? I hope you haven't forgotten us. We're waiting for you. We're even sending a little present... right to your cell door. It's your father. I know you're not there. I just wanted to talk. It's hard with no one to answer. Yvonne left me. I think she means it. What the hell are those dingbats doing at this hour? What's the goddamn rush? And you haven't eaten a thing. Soon we'll have to live in the bathroom. What's Albert going on about now? Listen, spaghetti! You might've warned me you were going to start earlier. Why, it's Stick! There wasn't any answer so I let myself in. Didn't you hear me ring? I figured it must be you. No one else knows I'm on parole. You guys are so well informed. Got any mustard? Oh, yeah, guess you haven't heard. Roland was named head of Fraud. A big loss for Morality. This is Marcel. '' Stick'' to friends. This is George, my new partner. Anyhow, I think you've already met. Hi, handsome. Stop it, George! Sit down and eat your smoked meat. You're gonna kill him! That's enough. I said cut it out. The smoked meat'll be cold. This lunch cost 12 bucks and we're gonna eat it! Sit! All right, great. Stick... this is George. Like a little oil on your fries? I knew he wanted to see you, but not this much! I'll get you, music lover! - Stop! You're making me dizzy! Listen, Stick's a pal. He's all right. Isn't that so, Marcel? You wouldn't screw us? Sit down. We brought you a sandwich. You got taste, Stick. Been away two years, nothing's broken, and it's still in style. I ought to have you decorate my daughter's place. You artists... Nothing's broken 'cause you know the stuff's not here. Yeah, we guessed that. We thought we'd wait around for you. You were scared shitless 'cause the feds were on your tail. You were sure they'd nail you. I don't talk. I was silent as a grave. What did you guys do for me? Your connections with the judges... My ass! So what's left... is gonna buy me a vacation to forget those two years! Look, we hit a snag. But according to my books, you still owe us 200 thou on the last delivery. And we're gonna collect! We'll even let you pay in Canadian dollars. These came out good, huh? They've got nothing to do with this! That's what I say too. Y'know, your dad still thinks you're on a trip. But now, it's time to do your part. I want the cash! There, I've saved your life too. We're even. And I'll bet you a smoked meat it'll be me who scores the next point. Think about it, Stick. 'Cause the next time I send a present a soft pillow for your ass won't be no help. Albert, tell Pepe I'm right! He won't listen to me. You tell him, please! We'll clobber 'em, no sweat. Any news from Marcel? It'll be all right. God, you smell good, Angelica! The deer are sleeping easier since you got into lasagna! Hey, it's Marcel! I'm happy to see you, son. Let me show you around! We'll have an archway here... with lights on both sides and your dad and Tony's hunting trophies. Come see in the kitchen. Your dad's changed a lot since his heart problem. It's the third year he can't hunt with us. We need space but he won't move. Last winter, he didn't heat the place, and it's the same this year. All my stucco's falling off. The restaurant's open late. Can't you wait? What the hell's this? You're not paid to read! How else can I learn French? Go to night school if you want to learn French! Talk to him. Do it for us. Your boy's skinny as a rake. Have supper with us tonight. See how big that one is? I thought he'd eat me. His paws were this big! The moose I called at Pit Lake was twice as big! No one else saw yours, but mine's up there! To hear him talk, his moose were always bigger than mine. To think I taught that noodle to call! Spoke no French at the shop, but I was his pal. I've seen the last three owners buried. He won't throw me out so he can peddle his lasagna! It's his turd brother, Gino. He's the one with the dough. He squeezes Tony like a boil. But tell me, how was your trip? They shut down the business and went back to the States. Nowadays, you eat some soup, you throw the can away, the Japs pick it up, make a Toyota and two radios out of it, and sell 'em back to you. What's that about meeting me at the airport? He's been gone two years and you're talking his ear off. Here's Pepe. It's lunch hour and he's in the way. Don't forget supper or I'll come after you with my shotgun. Bastards! They took my toolbox! I'm talking to you. I want Grappe, not tea! Chamomile tea is good for you. Not yet, let it steep. I'm talking to you. You were coming back from your trip, so I thought I'd pick you up. Mom didn't say anything? Go ahead. Want some milk? Say what? Put down your cup when you cough. And don't forget to swallow. You didn't find... my ring in the bathroom? You wear a ring? Yes. It belonged to Julie. Who's Julie? I don't wanna talk about it. I almost forgot. Your mother left you a parcel. I'll get it later. - You'll take it now. I can't. - I don't want it here. I'll take it tonight. I said now. This is a home, not a warehouse. It smells of her perfume. Get it outta here. Hi, Marcel. Where do you think you're going? If you keep on asking for trouble, music lover, you'll never hear in stereo again. I'll drive this through your drum. Listen, Stick, I'm ain't gonna spend lunch hours tailing you. It's bad for my digestion. There. You owe me a smoked meat. You're nothing. You're gutless! A little wimp, like all my other johns. You won't get it from me. You'll have to wait a long time. Get off! Let go! I need to find the money, Julie. We'll go away. We'll get a band together. In Australia. I love you. I love you. I spent two years talking to your answering machine 'cause you refused to let me see you. That was a mistake, Marcel. A big mistake. What happened? Nothing. A spill on my motorcycle. I always said you'd kill yourself on it. What's this? Your ring. I mean your girlfriend's; you don't wear one. That's not it. I know! It's my wedding ring. Oh, yeah... two guys from the travel agency came by while you were away. They had these punches on their belts that can put a hole this big through a plane ticket. You must really think you can take me for a ride. You kids act like you've changed the world... just 'cause you wear dark glasses at night. Lucky I didn't move out when Tony asked me to. I guess this is yours. Unless it's your mother's. You know how much money this is? I never counted. I was scared of fingerprints. So I put it in my lunchbox and waited for you outside jail. What? You had it with you at Bordeaux? Are you crazy? Do you want me locked up again? Do you know what I've been through? Three times I started out to turn that parcel in to the cops, so I'd finally be left in peace by you and your mother. The money's all that's keeping those guys from killing me... and you carry it around in your lunch pail! I knew it was silly, but I thought you'd be impressed to see me at the jail with a thermos full of hash. It's not hash. Don't try to tell me it's not drugs. I wanted to show you... to prove I'm not as dumb as you think. I read the papers. Even those short reports about drug busts. You never called after telling us you were going on a trip, that we shouldn't worry. I didn't know what to do. I waited. Lucky your mother never knew. It would've killed her. The cops showed up after she left. They had me shitting bricks with all their questions about that bloody parcel. After that, I started searching for it. Finally I found it. There were times... I'd call here just to hear your voice... on that machine. I'd talk about anything. You're crazy. I'm not crazy. I'm your father and you're my kid. For me that still means something. This is for you. Anyway, I wouldn't have a clue how to spend that much money. The other morning at Tony's, I wished you were 14 again! I'd have given you a kick in the pants and a good smack... for all the sleepless nights you caused me. This is the new house key. When your mother left I changed the lock so she'd never set foot inside again. Waste of time; she's never tried. See you, son. Take care of yourself. I've been ready for a long time. It's all I've been waiting for. Come on! You trying to lose this game? Hey, it's Marcel. Wanna go to Australia with me? Where? Australia with me. What for? Is it far? In miles I'm not sure. But it's at the end of the world. Is that where kangaroos come from? Are you crazy? I'm not crazy. I'm your son. And you're my father. For me that still means something. If you don't know what to do with yourself... and you feel like taking a little trip... we could always go fishing. Fishing? What do I do if one bites? Give a little tug and reel in some. We gonna sit here in the rain all day? It's perfect weather for fishing! A fine drizzle! Nothing like it! Think we'll see a moose? Maybe, but later in the afternoon... over there in the bay. They feed on the water lilies this time of year. Why don't you call? Bet you'd get an answer. Easy to see you're a city boy. A moose'll only answer when it's rutting in the mating season. In another two or three weeks, just before hunting starts. Your call's so great bet you'd get 'em excited even in winter. Come on! Just a little one, please! I'd really like to hear it. I'm going to do... the great call of the female. Here goes. I can't call with all that noise! OK, take it easy. Go ahead. Maybe someone else has the cash. No, it's him all right. All I know is he's waiting... or he wouldn't be wasting his time with the old man. I think I got a bite! What do I do? - Hold on! Watch your drag. Come on, tug on it! It's not working! - Your drag! Give it slack now! Looks like a beauty. Ease your drag. Press the knob. The other one! The other way! I'm gonna lose him! I know! There. You lost him. You told me to reel in! I said tug on it first! You trying to teach me to fish? Anyhow... you're some woodsman! I can't wait to tell Tony... that my father... knows how to call trout! You gonna tell Tony? He'll wanna hear about it. He'll be real impressed. Where's your respect for your father? If anybody'd told me I'd be fishing today... And if anybody'd told me I'd be going fishing with my kid - and on a motorbike! Hey, this is steep! I think I'll walk home. What the hell we doing here? Just follow me. - But it's dark. That's all right. - I can't see. Now don't budge. I'll be right back. No jokes now; it's bad for my heart. Florida? A '57 Buick. The Japs could never have made this beaut! It's incredible! It's for you. What's this about? You said you didn't know how to spend all that money. Here, look. It's the map of my old hunting ground. Lookit! The campsite on the lake, the island. See, Marcel! It's where you spotted that big moose, huh? Right there, in the bay. '' Big'' is not the word. He was a monster. You don't believe me. We'll go find him and we'll bring him back! We'll shut them wops up! It'll take more than your old army .303 to bag him. You need something heavier. Here. My boy and I are going hunting! We're going to Pit Lake, the two of us! Did you invite your mother? She didn't want to come? She was... - Don't say anything. I don't wanna know. Tell me it's not some joke. Does it look like a joke? Tell me that nobody... is going to make me move. Come on, get outta the car! We'll take it for a spin later. Sure you don't want Tony's rifle? Yours'll be fine. Why won't you tell me what's going on? Maybe I can help. I told you, it's not serious. I'm scared. Of another motorcycle accident? The cops were supplying me with the dope. The cops? They want the money. They're worried about me. I could talk. I won't let anybody touch my son! You hear me? Listen, Albert, all I want is for you and me to go hunting. Forget the rest. It'll all be settled soon. Night on the town, Stick? I've been easy on you - too easy. I've given you too much time. I dunno if I can sit on George more than 48 hours. I introduced him to that punk bitch of yours. If I let him, he'll carve his initials in her face. She may mind that more than you. She's a good-looker, that kid. Hi there. - Julie? Oh, Shirley! Last door on the left. You'll have to wait, handsome. They're all the same when they're horny. Here, buy a subscription to pay TV. I just started talking to her. What's that, a hearing aid? Gimme your tokens. Get out of here! Leave my clients alone! I'll scratch your eyes out! Thought you could fuck me like some turkey and I'd just fall in love again! When a guy comes here, I know what he wants. With you, I never know. A guy with a future wasting his time here! If you hurt her, I'll... Don't try to get tough with us! You're mad? Wasn't our little gift in jail enough? You give me no choice. I gotta teach you a lesson. This can't keep on. Everything'd fall apart. There'd be no more bosses, no more authority. I'm fond of you, Marcel. You know that. I've always been fond of you. Do something! With that tiny head of hers, I'd be surprised... if this bitch could handle more than 2mg. She'll get a tiny headline in the papers. '' Prostitute Dies of OD'' Stop! You'll have the cash in 72 hours. You got 24. Don't mess with me. I wouldn't wanna bother your father. Get outta here! Get out! Have you seen my boy? - Not this morning. It's your father! You're gonna be all right. I'm here, Albert! I'm here! I'll take you back home. Date of birth? Mr. Albert Brisebois, born September 02, 1922. I never noticed your beautiful hair. You promised that I wouldn't leave home... that I wouldn't go to the hospital. We're gonna have to postpone our hunting trip. I always hoped... you'd like hunting... and that we'd go out with Tony. We'll go. We'll go hunting together. I said to leave the door open! We did good work. Where's my bonus? Wanna do a line? - I don't have time. That you, Marcel? Florida! I've been resting. I was scared I'd die. We're gonna leave. You'll have to trust me. We're gonna go. Where? Hunting! Tonight? It'll burn a bit, but not long. Easy now. Take it. Feeling better? Sit up. Watch your head. You're full of surprises! Look at the moose! Are you going? I love you. Come on. Let's go bag our moose. A moose? Tonight? - Right now. Come on, follow me. What are we doing here? - Hold on a second. Watch my rifle. Moose... Lion, lynx, mongoose, mule, okapi, otter, parrot... What? No moose! What do we do now? Who ever heard of a zoo without moose? Should've gone to Pit Lake. That's where they are! Those bastards! I got an idea. Follow me. You're doing the pushing. Hey, look! You see him? In the back? Where? In the back, he's moving! I can't see. Look, he's over there! Go ahead, shoot! He'll get away! That's no moose. Course not, it's an elephant. What? Go on! We'll shut those wops up! It's your elephant, all yours! I can't see. There, that should help. He's huge! - Go on, shoot! I see him! - Don't miss! There he is! - Shoot! He's all yours. - He's gonna get it! You got him! I did? You killed an elephant! I got him! See that? First shot! Right between the eyes! We better get outta here. We gotta take a picture to show Tony! You mean it? Make it quick. Wait for me. They sure are big. Listen. He's still breathing. - That doesn't matter. Sit down over here. Kneel down. Hey, my rifle! - Forget it! You need your rifle in a hunting picture. OK, I'll get it. I better finish him off. - Are you nuts? You almost shot my foot off. Keep still so I can take the picture. Kneel down. Good. I'll get the picture. Smile. You hear? We're back home. Home? You've got to! Why aren't you at the hospital? We'll discuss it later. It has to be right away! What are you doing here? My old pal... What are you doing here? You shouldn't have. Angelica will make you a good coffee. I went hunting with Marcel. What? I got one... a big one... the biggest. I can't stay. I've got customers waiting. Listen, Marcel. He should be in hospital. Here, a surprise. - He needs a doctor. I'm sorry, you have to leave. We're closing. I'm very sorry. The bill's on us tonight. That feels good. Hello, Albert. You made a lot of changes. Looks really nice. Yvonne! As long as there's life, there's hope. Be brave, Marcel. Everything will be all right. Drink your coffee. Our health is so fragile. For us, it becomes a problem. Your mother was here. She was right here... by the bed. She's not mad at me anymore. She kissed me. I told her... I went elephant hunting. She was real proud of me. Digitized and restored in may 2013.
