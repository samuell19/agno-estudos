Now all of we knew and we love Malcolm Simpkins. And God knows what I was hating to see the boy going also, particularly in such a glory, frightful and awful Death. But it does not go in making losing one's head well On this thing also. I have a complete investigation Of these murders, in progress, and all the necessary precautions Are being taken. You know, I have been seeing that one Deke Slade around the area. Even? Deke Slade? I thought that you link they dismissed it of Tall Grass. does That include the postponement of the tournament? Absolutely not. These two isolated incidents, they are not at all to panic. I agree. We have the institutions of charity to think. Absolutely. Obliged Kelly. Pro-Am Invitationals is the club of this Bigger event of the year, and we cannot let anything spoil. That might do to us very well, Roy. For God, we are talking about exhibition in the television. Hi. Hi It Gnaws. are You the ambulance atendente? not much late for that, is not it? I am the atendente of the mortuary. Look, if you do not mind of I ask, You have some idea, what might it have caused that of? Sir, I already saw all the types of things in this work. I saw mutilations, amputations and beheadings. Once, I had one went for face The one Who is the wife took a light at home 360, to the area of the inferior groin. do You know the damage of a chain-saw? It can do, for the human body? But I never saw anything so before. Well, there was the arm of that boy that was I catch a trees trituradora last summer. They said, that it seemed something so, But I would not know certainly. I missed that. He did not die. But what I really do not manage to discover, is that. You mind, if I will maintain that? Right. I do not see because not. Thank you. Perhaps I see you, for a while. Perhaps. is not blood, is it that? Not, it is... is an oil. Crank is a dirty wheat. As do you know of that? It is weighed.

Disconnect that. Disconnect if it is. did You hear that? What? what are you talking About? did You see anybody? Any thing? Like what? It leaves for there. We go there. what is happening? It swims. I know that the things it have been morbid this way recently. Mas Roy, the tournament is more than you punish a play. It Is the biggest event of charity of the season, And we do not even begin to work in that. Now, I find that the first thing that we need to do. It is to value the amateurs in accordance with the talent. And put them with his professional partners, right? what do you know about Deke Slade? You did not hear a word that I said. did He use to work here? Yes. He and his father. I think that it was five years ago behind. do We fire? Why? I do not know. I was a caddie at that time. do You know, Roy? You begin to bother me really. We must have been planning this event. I am preoccupied if we get that. And I am preoccupied, with the security of the golfers. I hardly think that we must have maintained our open eyes. I am happy that you are preoccupied with something. Define his feet. Roy, I need his help. Concentrated. Maintain a firm breathing. I swing. Hello, Sr. Kent. do You want any berries? It is well. Is any world here that was registered? All less mister Simpkins. Oh. Yes, clear. are We going to have a moment of silence? In no way. The classroom begins. Oh it is well. Oh... The today lesson, it is with the forest. The important thing with the wood. It is the complete attendance. Let Me demonstrate. always Maintain the head, stopped and observe The club passes by the ball. Good attempt. The important detail, it is to maintain the arms. In front of the launch. Then, follow in front, head still, concentrates. Let you show me. The important detail is to maintain the straight arms. do I have, Roy, because you do not show anything to us? Not. Beauty queen Lange has his lesson. Even a good player, it can develop bad habits. And once formed, the bad habits are difficult to break. Let you show Me. The player plunges the shoulder very much into a strong swinging, Equal to. You always call. The same valley for the arms inflected in the launch. Always, always maintain, the motionless head and observe The club passes by the ball. The important detail is Rectum and concentration maintain the arms , right. Every golf player develops difficulties in his swing. It is a part of the play. When will that happen, always return to a basic one. I complete to follow, head still, and above all, concentration. With license, what do you do if you keep On Beating the ball out of the tee? what exactly do you want to say? You know, you put his ball in the tee, you align the shot. The near thing that you know, you look down, you have not anything besides tee. what is that? Cursed Texas Chain-saw massacre? Obviously, the situation is a little more complicated than I Was originally mischievous, believing. But that does not mean, what have not we still The situation well in the hand. Charlie? From this last ugly massacre, Now we know, what are we facing. We are dealing with a maniac, when Par? is using some type of electric tool to grind his prisoner, for the death. And as for Deke Slade? He knows on machines. He is walking for the course again. All the leads are being followed. Now what I need they are some volunteers. Persons who can receive orders and maintain a calm Head at the same time. To the one whom I can register now to begin, a spacious hunted maniac. Then does that mean that we will be closing the golf course? Not. Absolutely not. Not. Why? what I wanted to say was that, with a speed and success Conclusion of the maniacal hunting, It will Be business as usual here in Tall Grass Country Club. Right, chief Kimmel? Correct standard. Boa. Then, we are going to shut this meeting in. I thought that you two were players of the team I really feel very much, because of not having you listened before. Kelly Is everything all right. Some of these things are really difficult to believe. do You really think that the hunting to the maniacs is going to work? He is going to be a zoological one outside. Oh my God. is not it only the best? You cannot be speaking seriously. You cannot let these nuts go out thereabouts. They are going to kill someone. Are you for fun? This is the type of spirit, that we have been absent this way. Those expensive healthy players of team and they are going. Par? to be released of our problem. This maniac is mine. No, he is mine. Everything all right, men. Lift his certain hands and repeat after me. I... I... His name. your name. Swear solemnly, to defend The law in the whole extension. Swear solemnly to maintain the law in the whole extension. Men, I think that I was never so proud. What diabos is doing? I am going to burn this mother. You cannot do that. There are persons thereabouts. Roy. That stinks. he Takes away of the trolley. Working in that. Lyle. did You overdo? Roy? Lyle. One abates. what are you doing? I had he in my sight. Look at my course, Mr. Kent. Look at my course. Boris, other gives to me. "CLASSIC" once Formed, the bad habits are difficult to break. You can see how mine is taking a degree. As did his bad habit begin? I think that I woke up one morning and realized the Whole my life was setting free bolinhas white hairs In small green holes. I was not hardly prepared to begin to be lacking. And it was there what you began to drink? In no way. I was always drinking. I only improved in that, of what in my iron play. And I have been up to date, from that time. has Everything been incredible, n?? Yes. are They going to find it, do not go? Mr. Kent? Mr. Kent, they found it. Leland and his group, 17 caught it in the hole. Deke. Where did you find it? Well, we were leaving from the fairway. And we were going for the day 18, when did I think that knots it Must check the heavy brush. And it is there that we find it. With that. God, that is disgusting. We are turned over on him. He probably was trying to begin it, to use it to kill us. You are idiotic. do You really think that I am? Yes, yes, yes. do You think that the cutter might cause the damage that was done? yes. Yes. It is the cut launch, it is 1/3 of the size of the one. That is still outside. Face, take away it from here and read his rights. Great mistake. I would like to express only my sincere gratitude Par? all those brave members, what risked his lives themselves to put An end to this terrible threat. With this terrible trial on us and behind us, It Is of turn to the golf, as usual, here in Tall Grass Country Club. I would like to remember, to all on ours... We are going to take it to the interrogation. You can want come and hear what he says. For what yes, yes! is not Roy, the best? They caught it. Roy Kent? My husband looked, for you. He was so happy when He discovered You were the new professional here. He said that you would be going to repair his slice. And he lets you go there. what is to be of me? And what is to be of Caddy? I only wanted that you knew. Boy, I... I That is not in leading to any place. Oh, that is the best. Have a look in this. Let me see if I understood again. did not You kill these persons? That is certain. are You saying that someone killed these persons? Not. Oh, that is certain. You are saying that nobody is killing. Those persons, that a cutter is doing everything in his solitude, Right? It was that that I said. That one face is totally crazy. Wait until the jury eats this filth. Oh, Mr. Slade. do not You think that a cutter of renegade gram Is not much ridiculous? I do not know. I saw machines doing some quite strange things. The man builds, notice, maintain, It depends on them. me them they are not completed. Now all of we had, a machine to do something. It should not do. And electric razor with a policeman of security that Still cuts you and takes away blood. A great jet, it passes well in the inspection But his motors fall as well as he is rising for the sky. That happens the time completely in the big and small forms. it is not so surprising. My God. Poor poor person. are You receiving all that, Hinkle? It can bet. A long dive. Totally certific?vel. Very well. Yes. And then what were you doing exactly there? Rastreamento. Following that. That is certain. I am the only one who can stop it I already heard the sufficient of this filth. I have the sufficient thing to make it do the high jib of the waters. Incredible. Well, I am happy, what put an end to that. Now, we can turn all on the business. I always knew, that we would be going to catch it. I have nothing to do with this! That was sad with Deke. They say that he is wrong since his father died. Hunm. Anyway, I am happy what finished. Now we can concentrate on the tournament. It Is tomorrow, you know. If his departure times are piled up, in intervals of 15 minutes, Everything must work, without problems. You played already with some of these professionals before. You tell me how they like to shape it. Right. Roy, you are not, me hearing again. Roy? Roy? It finished, Roy. They caught it. I have not so much certainty, what did they do. Roy, all the maniacs you think that they are outside, running thereabouts killing persons, with gram cutters? That simply, it does not do sense. The tracks in the wheat field are three times to width Of the cutter brought today. Roy, cannot you tell me that you believe in what he was saying? For what not? That is of crazy ones. Perhaps I am missed. But you would like to send persons for out. Tomorrow without having absolute certainty? Oh, oh... Not. me them since we can be sure? There is a way. I do not know because we are in slipping. We might have got Lyle let us in. I want only to maintain that between you and I. what exactly are we doing here? If I will be certain, the only thing that is going to be in this bag. It is a gram. And if you are missed? we will not have anything, to preoccupy us, do we go? Be careful. Perhaps you should not look. what does that mean, Roy? That means, what is still outside. me them since that can be? Kelly, I do not know. I do not understand myself.

Oh certainly. They had a ray of more spacious cut, but eat, he was not minding. He refused. He said that he did not want to change. Then they dismissed it. 25 years of good service, and they simply set it free. Well, the next day I was there to help it, cleaning his things, out of the garage. It was when I found it.
