What do you think? It's too quiet, too easy. Too late. Banner, Wilson, you take the left and right flanks. Check out the church, go. We go down the middle, check out the cantina, and that storage building. Go. They're probably in the church. You go check it out. Why does the black man always got to check it out first? You check it out. Because you're the medic. Somebody might be hurt in there. Son of a bitch. Nothing inside. Let's keep going. Front door or back? Doesn't matter. They won't be inside. They'll wait to ambush us on our way out. About time you showed up. I'll save your life for a quarter, Murph. Where's the Congressman, sir? Move. Let's get some antibiotics in him. The rest of the team, sir? We're all that's left. What about the cantina? All dead. Who were they? Local resistance. I heard gunfire yesterday, sounded like an execution. We're ready. Let's go home. Go, go, go, go, go! I told you they'd be waiting! Come on, move it! Move it! Ammo, ammo! You've got a backup plan? You better believe it. Reb, bring in the cavalry. Spray them good, Halloward. You ready? Ready. Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go! Come on, come on! Cover me! Let's go, let's go! Go, go, go! Go, go! Come on! Move it. Come on, let's go! Come on! I'm coming! Go, go, go, go! Take it out! Take it out, go. Go, go! Good morning, honey. Bad dream? The usual. You can't go back for him. No one can. I don't know if I can do this anymore. Jumping out of helicopters for Uncle Sam. Yeah? What else are you going to do? I don't know. I thought about maybe pro wrestling. Get to work, soldier. I've got a lot to do today if we're going to have that party tonight. Hollywood, that's a bogey in your air space. I'd get out of there. I'm trying. Where are you, Reb? Right up your ass, Hollywood. Can't you feel me, boy? Hold still now. I knew you Hollywood boys liked it from behind. A little decorum, flight leader. Roger that, sir. All right, you inbred redneck. Let's see if you can keep up with me now. Good move. Didn't think you had it in you. Where'd you go, where'd you go? Judas Priest. Say goodbye to Hollywood. Aagh. Good shooting, Hollywood. Do me a favor. Call my folks. Tell them I went down in flames and died a hero. All right, boys. Head back for the barn. Roger that, sir. That kid is a hell of a pilot. The best in Company C. And you don't like him because he's an arrogant son of a bitch. I think he still needs a little guidance. And we need him. This ranger group just took deliverance of a F-117 stealth fighter. And Hollywood is the only Army pilot that can fly one of these things. What the hell do we need a stealth fighter for? This model is a modified trainer. Has an expanded cargo and personnel capacity. Congratulations, Murph. You're about to lead the world's first stealth delivered airborne ranger unit. Undetected troop insertion. You don't have to kiss the pilot's ass. Just bond with him a little. Great. Hey, hey, chili's here. That for me? Yeah, watch it, it's heavy. - How is it? Too hot. He always makes it too hot. Thank you, Vincent. No, I don't. It's not true. It's so heavy. Hey, Sarge. How's that lovely wife doing? Chess called her killer. How about a beer? Yeah, lead the way. Here you go, Sarge. Nice flying today, hot shot. Nice of you to notice. Hey, what about me, Chich? I sent flowers to your folks. Hey, the South will rise again. Dream. Let me guess, your husband's chili. He's done it. Hate to miss a funeral, Reb. But I'm heading out to Hollywood. Looking for an agent. Figure top gun on my resume would give me some real star power. Well, I hate to burst your bubble there, but you're too damn ugly to be a movie star. But you know what, you got such a pretty little mouth, Chich, and I will let you later. Sweeten that up for you? Negative, sir, but I would like some of that damn chili, you inconsiderate bastard. You going to offer me some? You're going to like this. I made it really mild. You know, the babies can eat this chili. I can't stand spicy, now. It rips my intestines out. This will be good for your intestines. You must still be flying pretty high after today. Just doing my job. Lighten up, Hollywood. You're a damn good pilot. I respect that. I don't really care if you do. You don't like me very much, do you? I do my job. I follow my orders. I don't have to be your friend. Well, then what the hell are you doing in my house? Hey. How about some coffee? No, honey, I'm fine. Sorry,. Hey, captain. Save your life for a quarter. Just happen to have one right here. Outstanding. Let's make some room. Need some Tabasco in that. Here, a little nice seeing in action. OK, who wants in? I'm the pay. Right here. All right, cap. Hollywood, are you in on this? All right, all right, all right. Move it, move it. I need some more money. That a girl. Hollywood 10, Hollywood 10, right here, right here. Proud of you. All right. OK, here we go. Take the quarter here, you see that? Your old man is going to find this really easy. Put it under here. Going to do a little toss it back and forth. Here we go, move it around here, this way. This is pretty darn easy, I'm telling you. Which one, bubba? High five. There we go. Sorry, captain. Try again. I'm out. How much you had a drink last night, captain? Just a six pack of Kentucky bourbon. What do you got? This just came in from intel. Looks like Salvatore's back in the drug business again in Central America, in San Sedres no less. The village is deserted. Most of the locals have fled up into the hills. He's using the rest for slave labor. He's also using the local air force to smuggle large quantities of cocaine. He's got a factory right in the middle of the air base and most of his supplies are stored in unused hangers. This is the largest drug operation in Central America since the 1980s. Back to the future. Isn't that something, Cap? I'd sure like to go down there again and kill that son of a bitch. You and me both, chief. Anybody else see this? Yeah. There's more. This came to intel last week. Lieutenant David Rifkin, United States Army Rangers, 10 25122185, born 26-02-1960. Hello, yankees. Give him a little belly.. Anybody need to see more? No. Salvatore wants to make an exchange, Rif for a drug dealer we're holding in California. We won't play. US government does not make deals with drug cartels, especially for one lone Army Ranger from some elite task force that doesn't officially exist. So what do we do? We go get him. Captain Murphy, I cannot risk American lives and equipment on some ill-advised and illegal rescue mission for one lone soldier. There are political considerations. With all due respect, sir, this isn't my first time at the barbecue. Now you must be showing us that tape for a reason. Assemble your men in hanger four, 19:00 hours. Yes, sir. Looks like you might get your wish, Chief. The F-117 C stealth will be used to fly us into a deserted airstrip six clicks North of the village. New active stealth capabilities will allow us to arrive totally undetected. I'd like you to all meet our new medic, Sergeant Philips. Glad to be aboard, sir. Lieutenant Andrews will fly the stealth because of his vast experience with this aircraft. Sorry, Reb. No problem, sir. What about the Southern contingent? We have a view we'd be flying a Navy F-14 from the aircraft carrier, Oakland. Lieutenant Randall will be your copilot. Ready when you are. Once you've entered San Sedres airspace, you are to engage and distract all enemy aircraft. Once you're done, you'll supply further air support for the ground mission. Yes, sir. I'm counting on you, Reb. Don't let us down. I won't, sir. What about the mission after we rescue Rif? We want their base destroyed and Salvatore's drug operation out of business. That is the official mission. It is critical. These people are counting on us. We've tried diplomatic means before. Almost lost a congressman in the process. I came back from that mission. Some didn't. There is no way to get to him that's honest or legal. Well, being good Rangers, sir, we'll do it dishonest, illegal, and give it to him up the old ass. All right, all right, all right, listen up. I want you to all get some rest. It's going to be a long couple of days. Dismissed. How come you're not sleeping? I've been awake all night listening to you snore. I got the test results back from the doctor yesterday. It doesn't look good. Hey, we can always adopt. It just takes so much time. You going to fool around to me while I'm gone? Maybe. Promise you'll tell me all the details. I'll take pictures. Anybody I know? Everybody. Captain Jack Stevens, skipper of the Oakland. Lieutenant Randall, sir. Lieutenant Carter, sir. But my friends call me Reb. And mine call me Captain. Your Colonel Reynolds give me some details about your mission, gentlemen. In fact, too few. I was impressed with your flight record, Lieutenant, particularly on an F-14 Tomcat. And I do see that your carrier qualified. But what I don't see is why a Navy pilot can't fly this mission. Well, Captain, the way we see this little get to, it's an Army problem, so the Army ought to be the one to clean it up. Not good enough, Lieutenant. And you can save the good old boy chatter for somebody else. That doesn't do a thing to sweeten my disposition. That's too bad, Captain. The dispatch from Colonel Reynolds explains the parameters of this operation and the need for secrecy. Hell, sir, I'm just here fly one of your Tomcats. And I don't give a damn about dispatch, Lieutenant. If I'm going to trust one of my airplanes to an Army pilot let him fly in harm's way, then by God, I want to know why. Yes, sir. I know the terrain. I know the ground crew. And I can fly that piss out of one of your Tomcats. Now, you could let a Naval aviator fly this operation, but the Army needs me. Fair enough, Lieutenant. I'll introduce you gentlemen to your flight officer. And if you all need any help, you don't hesitate to call. Roger that, sir. Let's go, Phillips. Nobody's going to hold your hand. Come on. You know, Doc, 50 years ago, scientists were convinced that it was impossible to fly faster than the speed of sound. At that speed, they figure your plane would hit some invisible barrier and explode. Yeah. Try not to touch anything, sir. This is a modified trainer. Your controls duplicate mine. Carrier standing by, sir. Very well, Sergeant. Give the stealth clearance for take off. Stealth, you are cleared for takeoff on Runway 7B. Roger that. Locked and loaded. Stealth flight, this is tower. We have you on 7B for immediate take off. Wind speed is 18 knots, cloud cover nominal. Roger, tower. Screen is operating. I have a lock on flight path. Roger, stealth. You're a go for throttle up. Godspeed, gentlemen. OK, Doc? They're up. Alert the Oakland. Yes, sir. Com check, com check. Mother, this is Tomcat 230. Hail copy. Over. Roger, 230. You're hooked up to cat. Hold back in position. All right, gentlemen. Let's get them up. Better take good care of my airplane, Lieutenant. You break it, you buy it. Roger that, sir. You just send that bill to the United States Rangers. Throttling up. Hang on to your balls, Randall. Yeehaw! What a kick in the ass. Zero to 60 in two seconds. There is no substitute. Godspeed, Army. All right, Randall,.. Battery 090, distance 180 miles, ready to break it three, two, one. Having fun, Randall? Yes, sir. Both planes are heading to the rendezvous point. Think they have a chance, sir? No. No way. Not a chance in hell. But they might just pull it off anyway. I picked up on one, maybe two American aircraft on radar. I tried. Try and relax, Colonel Juarez. I was expecting this. We're not butchers. Morgan. Have this man clean up the mess. How far are we from San Sedros airspace? About 10 minutes. There's Reb. Damn, San Icinto's ground radar has a lock on us. Already. Man, that was fast. Time to go to work. Good acting self, boys. We're on TV. Copy that. Activated stealth mode. What now? - They'll be along soon. You keep your eyes peeled. Tomcat 230, be advised, we have multiple bogeys. 709er, 15,000 feet at two miles, nose high. Roger that, sir. I see them. So where do they keep the weapons on this thing? You're sitting on them, Doc. I am Maverick's forward fire infrared guidance. Like 300 pounds of land interdiction TNT. It's a beautiful thing, bada boom. Man, man. New bearing is 7.0. This is the national air force of the Republic of San Sedros. You are violating our sovereign air space. Identify yourself, or we'll have to shoot you down. He's trying to lock. Must be sweet on us. Make a right. Slide out of the cross hairs. Roger that. Now let's play with this joker. I'm on his ass. Going for weapons lock. I got lock on his ass. Let's watch that pig squeal. Say good night, Irene. 0.204 standing by, Sir. Do we launch? Negative, gentlemen. It's their war. I just hope to God they win it. Got another. I see him. Hang on, hang on. We're losing power. Put your poker face on, Randall. Just play a little five card stud. Take it on down to the card table. He's got a lock. - Not for long. Hang on! I call your hand, amigo. Forward cone aces high. Still on his tail. Let's take one out. Stick to the mission. Maintain radio silence. Sir, he's got a lock on Reb. Hold your position, Lieutenant. Somebody's sitting in. - Where? I don't see him. Help me out, Randall? Where? I can't see him. Shit, he's fired. I can't see him. Where is he? We're hit! We're hit! We're going down. Mayday, mayday. Going down. Randall, we're going to have to eject. Eject, eject, eject. They're off radar. Tomcat 203, 203, do you copy? Sir, do we send in the search and rescue? That's a negative. Contact Wingate field report status to Colonel Reynolds. Aye aye, sir. You want a ground search? No, new coordinates. There's an old drug smuggling field about seven clicks from the target. You're changing our landing site. Why? Just a hunch, Lieutenant. Now you're wasting our time. Do it. New bearing. Landing in four minutes. Below radar. Deactivating stealth. Hey, Phillips. We're on the ground. So how do we hide this thing? You really think someone's got to take this thing for a joyride? There's lots of deserted airfields in this area. They'll never find us. Well, you'll pardon me if I don't trust your hunches, sir. The Oakland's lost contact with Lieutenant Carter's plane. They believe it's gone down. Should we try to contact Murph? He'll shout if he needs us. Let's go, let's go. Move out. We search for Reb and Randall? Salvatore's men will be coming the area for survivors. If Reb and Randall are still alive, they may buy us some time. If not, sooner or later, those men will find us. So we finish the mission as quickly as possible. You're just going to leave them for those butchers? I'm going to follow my orders, just like you. Let's move out. Cold hearted son of a bitch. He's wrong. You do what he tells you every time he tells you, you just might get through this alive. Now you get killed, hot shot, that ain't going to bother me. But you get him killed, it will. Capeesh? British Gala, 1894 issue. Now, if we can get the '98 reprint, I'll have the complete set. Colonel Juarez managed to shoot down the American plane. Any sign of the stealth? I got a truck on the way to the airstrip. I think we should head to the prison compound in case they beat us. I think you worry too much. Relax for a moment. Tell me something, Morgan. Why is it you're so loyal to me? This isn't your country, and it isn't your cause. Your checks don't bounce. It isn't the money. You thrive on this kind of action. It's what I'm good at. I don't know anything else. How do you sleep at night, Salvatore? Me? I'm a businessman. This is our nation's business, despite what the politicians claim. I do this for my family, for my country. A patriot. Yes, a patriot. You're quite right, Morgan. Let's go check on the prisoner. They'll shout if they need us. Well, what if they can't shout, Colonel? You've got to give me more than that. Captain Stevens, this mission is in a state of flux. We are in a combat situation, and the picture changes as we speak. I don't need you to explain combat situations to me, Colonel. I did my tours in 'Nam, Navy SEAL. I meant no disrespect. Well, I never dreamed you did, Colonel. But I've got a plane down and two pilots missing that I'm responsible for somewhere in Central America. Now project status info better start flowing from your HQ like crap through a goose, or I'm calling Central Command, Colonel. Is that clear? Hey, look. Look at that. Thanks. I never killed a man like that before. Get over it. It's what we're here for. Hey, Reb. Yeah? - Check it out. Outstanding. Now we're going to have some fun. Let's get the hell out of here. No sign of the stealth at the air strip. So we wait for them to come to us. Pays to advertise. That's him. Come on. Did you see him? Chic, you know the drill. Lay down some demo. We'll move on your signal. Signal? Yeah, just a couple of big bangs. All right. Let's get the rest of the gear. You ever light that thing? What, are you crazy? Smoking will kill you. Go on. You ever light that thing, sure. What the hell is that? Oldest trick in the book. No, man, it looks like a kid. I'm going to stop. No. Keep going. Don't stop. Good one, Reb. Now just what the hell did you want me to do, Randall? Run him? Let's give him something to pass the time? Come on. Let's go get him. We stay til we hear Chiccio's signal. Son of a bitch. You enjoying this? If you want to stop me, then kill me. Don't tempt me, kid. I'll do it. What do you got? All set. Let's light it up. Yes, sir. Go. Save your life for a quarter, Rif. Look out! Cha madre, I wasn't expecting this. What were you expecting? They're Army Rangers. Go! Get a truck. Bring them back. Jesus! What's the matter, Captain? You forget where we left the plane? We're not going back to the plane yet. They'll be sending trucks. Or they could just bypass us and go straight to the plane, sir. Pardon me for saying so, Captain, but I'd really like to get in the air. We'll get back to the plane, Rif. Just give me a few minutes, will you? There. Truck. Truck, let's go. Hey, Cap, it's Reb and Randall. What do you know? Captain, sure is good to see you boys. I knew you were still alive, you stupid redneck bastard. Just don't try and kiss me, West Hollywood. How'd you manage this? We had some help. Maria. Your comrades tell me you are here to help. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. We've got plenty of time. Shut up, Hollywood. Crackers for you, beef stew, Jorge, little chicken and rice. Thanks, big guy. Finish your grub, soldier. He's surprisingly in good shape, but his wrist wounds are bad. There's a danger of infection. We gotta get him out of here. This place isn't safe for them or us. You mean I'm not safe. Is that it? Stop your whining, Rif. As soon as we get some food in you, I'm going to put you to work. Pulling rank, sir. Technically, yeah. We'll move when they move. Pass it on. Well, from what I gather, sir, Maria there, she's been fighting Salvatore's men from the hill for about a year now. Little guy there name's Jorge. That's her son. He's a tough little bastard. I think he's taken a shine to you, sir. Cute kid. Doesn't speak very much. I was talking to Doc about it. Said he's suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome. He thinks that Maria's old man was the leader of the resistance. Salvatore had his men tortured to find out where he was. Apparently, they did some pretty evil shit to her. So to protect his mama, Jorge gave up his daddy. Hasn't spoken since. That's a hell of a way to grow up. Yes, sir. I'd given up on your country. You wouldn't be the first. What happened to the villagers? Most who still live work for Salvatore in his factory at the air base. The rest have scattered into the hills. So the child and a few weapons is all you have to fight with? It is what I have, Captain. It's what I have. And you, if you're willing. We came here to put Salvatore out of business. In order to do that, we need to get back to our plane. You can help us. If you do, you might buy yourself and your people some freedom, from him, at least. You carry much anger with you. Because I've been here before. You have met Salvatore. We will help you if you kill him. That's a promise I'll keep. Sun up, sir. Take Randall, and get the truck. We're moving out now. Doc. Wood. Captain, I'd like to join this fight. You hold on to this, soldier. Move it. Let's go. Cover me! Go, go! Hollywood, get them out. Finish the mission. I ain't going anywhere. Finish the mission! Come on, let's go. Come on. Get all right. Come on. That's enough. No point in all of you dying. I've got one of your wounded men right here, he needs medical help bad. Your call, sir. That's better. Didn't they warn you about this, Mack? When dealing with prisoners of war, always assume they may have turned. You can't do this. I did it. They paid me. That's it. We risked our lives to bring your sorry ass back. See, Salvatore figured you'd be back to get me. I was the bait. He pays real well. Maybe he's got something for you. That's enough. This is the end game, Murph. I'm going to kill you, Rif. However this ends, you're going to die. Morgan, let's go. Move them out. It's OK. It's OK. Just come on. Hold that there. Murph's bought us some time. Hey, Doc, you got another one of those bandages? Yeah. Thanks. Is he going to be OK? Yeah, just fine. I just got to get this on him and go. You have not found the plane. We will. I hope that you do. I cannot keep protecting you from my government without something to show for it. Do you have any idea how many treaties the Americans have violated by simply flying into your airspace? And they can't admit landing a stealth plane here without incurring the wrath of most of their Latin American allies. Don't worry, Colonel. You'll get your new toy. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am expecting a telephone call. No word from the ground team. Get me a secure line. Scramblers live in the galley, sir. How are your hands? They hurt like hell. I do think Morgan was enjoying himself a little too much. Nonsense. The line is secure. Give me some good news. It appears they didn't land where we agreed. Perhaps your satellite recon can help. It is a small country. It's not that easy. I don't have a satellite in position, and it's too late in the game to check for heat traces. Go look for it. How many airfields can there be in your country? More than you might imagine. We have some of your men here, and I hope to have some answers very soon. Whatever it takes. After you get what we need, terminate them. Let's go visit our guests. USS Oakland on line two, sir. Thank you. Captain Stevens, good to hear from you. I was just wondering if you'd heard from your team, Colonel. They're under strict radio silence, Captain. Typical for this type of small window penetration. Colonel, they've been on the ground for more than 24 hours. I don't want to debate military tactics with you, but from where I come from, we don't call that a quick in and out. I'd like send a recon flight into the area, provide them with a little backup. Can't risk anymore of your planes until I talk to Murph. I've worked with this team before. I suggest we leave them alone until they get the job done. I'll keep you posted. How you doing? I can still kick your ass, Lieutenant. Looks like Rif's a lousy shot. How's the kid? I think he'll be OK. Wow, what's it going to be, Lieutenant? Well, those people are depending on us to carry out this mission, right? You will. But first we have to get your friends back, OK? What would Murph do in this situation? You know the answer to that, Lieutenant. Question is, sir, what are you going to do? Let me take a moment to explain the utter hopelessness of your predicament. Captain Murphy, you are the one man who has stood up to me, time and time again. I respect that. We are cut from the same cloth. Both of us believe in the rightness of what we do. You are loyal to your country. I am loyal to the business of my country. And like you, I only harm those who would do me harm. I think I'd prefer the torture over the speeches, Salvatore. Yeah, you all have them electrodes for our balls? No, no torture, just civilized men discussing business. You know, your superior, Colonel Reynolds has been selling out your country for over a decade, arms, intelligence, drugs. And now, you. He cooked up my rescue in order to get you guys to bring Salvatore here his stealth plane, signed, sealed, and delivered for a lot of cash. Just like you. Mr. Rifkin has been very helpful. Let's just say he's found better career opportunities in the private sector. All right. I've heard enough. What's the deal, Salvatore? You tell me where the stealth plane is. I give you safe passage out of the country. I'll even give you Reynolds. I'm tired of dealing with him. And I'm not keen about funding his golden years. You get the credit for uncovering his treason and possibly promotion. I mean, come on. Who cares if you lose one stealth plane? America has plenty of them, no? I tell you what, you decide. Think about it. I'll give you two hours. Mr. Rifkin, perhaps you can stay and persuade them. A chance to earn your pay. Is that what you earned those gold bars for, Lieutenant? To turn on your fellow Rangers? That kind of blood is going to be tough to wash off, my friend. I sleep real good at night, Murph. I'm coming for you in your dreams, Rifkin. Bastard. You always thought you were John Wayne, didn't you? So did you. So Se or Salvatore, what if we decided not to take your generous offer? You'll die, just like him. According to my calculations, we should... We have two more miles, this way. Well, let's go. What are you waiting for? You want to see me? Yes. I was just thinking about the CIA. You worried? No. They had a landing strip about two miles from the border, used to smuggle cocaine out of here. It's the most likely hiding place for the stealth. I'll have Waters run an air search of those coordinates. If it's there, he'll lead you to it. I'll get a truck ready. You want us to kill the prisoners? Rifkin is still at the compound. Have him do it. And then kill him. I've been waiting for that. If he was going to shoot me, he should have killed me. Ease up, Sergeant. I want him, too, but you'll tip our hand. Yeah. Salvatore wants you to shoot the prisoners. All right. Let me just get out of this gear. Can't stand the smell of this shit anymore. They're loading a truck at the side of the compound. All right. Let's take them out. Shoot this, shoot that. Getting to old for this. Sir, save your life for a quarter. Rack them up. See it? There, say goodbye. You ain't gonna find it, bubba. You gotta be kidding me. You don't think I saw the old switcharoo there? You wanna play? You OK? Yes. OK, see that? You have to find it. There it is. All right. Which one, amigo? La primera. S. Afternoon, folks. You piece of shit. How's your arm, Chich? You ought to know. All right. Hollywood, let's get Reb and Murph. You guys stay with the truck. Let's go. I knew he was a better a shot than that. What do you know? La otra. Esa. Wrong again. Whoops. Where'd that quarter go? I think he wants to see the inside of the cups. You want to see the inside of the cups. OK. You got to look real close, OK? Whoa, whoa, Captain. He's with us. Chiccio's OK. I only nicked him. Look, I only did what I had to do to try and save all of us, OK? Where's Randall? He didn't make it. I know what you were doing. Let's go. After you, Rif. Get in, get in the truck! Get your sorry ass in there. Get in there, goddammit! Follow those guys. I'm taking up the helicopter. We got to go back to the village to get Phillips and the kid, if that's OK. That'll be fine, Lieutenant. Where'd you get hit? I'll be all right. Just a scratch. That's too bad. They'll be here soon. Watch the road. - OK. Let's go, boys. Come on. We don't have much time. We got to get him in the truck. How bad's the kid? He needs a doctor, a real doctor. What he needs is a whole new life. What the hell do you want me to do about it? I'm glad I don't have to make that decision, sir. Hell, boys. These bastards ain't playing fair now, are they? Arviderci, you bastard. Colonel, my zap recon is picking up an increase in ground activity in the target region. I'm formally requesting permission to send in air support. Permission denied. Do I have to remind you that Central. Command shares my views? At this point, the primary objective is deniability. We have no ground troops in San Sedros. Stand down. Think he'll go up anyway, sir? He might. If he can help Captain Murphy and the stealth, they can do a lot of damage to Salvatore's operation. Semaan R, have 207209 standby for a routine training flight. Understood, sir. I located the stealth on the ground, grid 603. I have a truck on the way, and I'd suggest get some planes in the air. Let's go, Hollywood. Murph, take my son with you to America. Make him well. What are you talking about? You're both coming with us. No. I stay here and fight with my people. Please. Promise me. Look, Maria. You fought long enough. Mama! Hell, we got company. Go ahead and wind it up, I'll be back. Phillips, get the kid! You bastard! Take him to the plane! I'm out! It's all right. You stay right here with me. Fire it up, Lieutenant. Everybody in? Get us up. I hope to hell we have enough runway. You're supposed to be a genius of this airplane, Lieutenant. Start proving it. You got it. Now. We're in the clear. The stealth. I told you so. Shoot it down! I repeat, shoot it down! Captain Stevens, satellite recons pick up bogeys over San Isidros. And we have a heat signature on an American stealth plane. All right, let's get 207209 into the air, gentlemen. This is the Navy's war now. They're the same missile sites and ground batteries. I want that plane down! I'm going to need your help with these air to ground missiles. Put on your headset. You're going to play bombadier. Power grid on. Adjust eternal focus to your site, and when the grids lock, you fire. Just like a video game. Fire! Incoming zaps. Gonna miss. Descending to 2,000 feet. Here's your chance, Captain. Target locked. Fire! Secondaries. Target destroyed, Lieutenant. We got company. Releasing countermeasures. Go to active stealth. Negative function. Shrapnel damage. Hang on. He's still behind us. I'm going to try to outrun him. Need some help, Army? Navy's here. Step right up, sailor. Bogey's on your tail. We'll give him something else to shoot at. He's got you in his sights, 209. Not for long. He's still there. I need a clear shot. Break in three, two, one. Break. Good job, 209. He's all mine now. This will lock it. Bye bye. He's gone. One more out there. No, no this one's mine, Navy. Nice shooting, Army. How'd you get the word? Compliments of Captain Stevens. You can thank him yourself. Will do. - All right. This is as far as we can take you. Good luck, sir. We're out of here. Captain Stevens, much obliged. Always glad to help, soldier. It's my little gift to the boys in Company C. All threats have been neutralized, sir. Mission accomplished. Almost. Target is in range. Loading laser missiles. BGMs armed. Target locked. Good work, sir. Request permission to head for home. Permission granted, Lieutenant. Get us out of here. Why aren't you in your dress uniform, Murph? Press will be here in 10 minutes. It's a great day for Ranger Company C. Salvatore told me everything. Really? You'll play along, Murph. You're on the fast track now. I just got the papers for your promotion to Lieutenant Colonel. I'll announce it at the press conference. You'll be right up there next to me, kissing ass when I pin these bars on you. I won't be there. Neither will Chich, Rif, Reb, or Randall. Neither will you. Well, like you said, Murph, all the witnesses are dead. Except you and me. Captain, we'll take it from here. I gave my deposition to Army Intelligence this afternoon. Army Intel has had you under investigation for some time. I was hired as your assistant to help build a case. Like I told Rif, that's Ranger blood on your hands. It's tough to wash off.
