I cultivate the white rose, in July as in January, for the sincere friend, who gives me his frank hand. For the cruel one who tears out the heart with which I live, neither thistles nor nettles I cultivate, I cultivate the white rose. Lower it! Looking for someone? I was just looking. My school was there. Nowadays... This story is fictional. Any reference to people or real events is purely by chance. You treat thieves like thieves! Didn't your mother teach you? Come here, I'll show you! They must sign this document! Understand? Alberto! Alberto, no way! Sandro. - Didn't you recognize me? - No. When did you arrive? An hour ago. It's nice to see a friendly face. I called you last year when I was in Milan. - But another company answered. - Yeah, we moved, we're growing. Still a lawyer? How many times have you been to Rome but never called? Last time I tried, I swear it. You'd just left. Excuse me. Did you see the time? Get to work. I pay to start at 7 am. Hey, Sandro. - Hi. What does he want? - To talk with you. Give him 10,000 lire. - Isn't that Piero? - Sure, my little brother. Two bankruptcies. We all have our cross. He's mine. - Which old friends do you still see? - Nino sometimes. And Livio? He made a career out of his wife's money. What about Cesare? No questions about him? He's married. Did you hear? Cesarino got married! Nino told me. Cesarino married? Yes, he didn't want to starve. He works at a movie theater in the suburbs. Remember, when you all came with me to the station? Cesarino got on the rails, so the train wouldn't leave. Right! I have a date soon. Listen, call me tonight. Sure. Your number? It's on my card. But you won't call. Listen to me, we're having dinner together. I'll organize a nice reunion. All right? With Cesarino? If you'd like, we can track him down. But you should know, nowadays, Cesarino is a poor devil. You'd be disappointed. I guarantee it. Life is a serious business. God, it's also a scam. In short, a serious scam. OK then. Let's leave Cesarino where he is. You know what we'll do right now? We'll call our friends, eh? C'mon, it'll be fun. In Shanghai, with my wife, we ate an exquisite dish. We did some research and found out that it was a kind of rat cake with honey. - Did you wife faint? - No, she never does. Have you noticed we get ulcers with today's dishes? We are all doomed. And then you can dissect us. For you, it's a 10 minutes autopsy. - Will you cure me? - For free? Right, ask money from a friend! Children? No, not yet. And you? - One. - I beat you all! Four. Four boys. At least, I'm working for something. Let's get our wives together. This week. I have a seminar in Zürich. When you come back then. Yes, we'll call each other. Is your wife from Rome? - How long have you been married? - Six years. How you say it! How? Sighing. No, we get along very well. We argue sometimes. There'd be trouble if we didn't. Our bachelor! And your conquests? Seduction doesn't suit me anymore, I get bored. It's either the same night, or the next day… that I cut it short. I dump them. I treat them badly. These days, I've been picking up wives. The dissatisfied. And you satisfy them? Sure. No disrespect to husbands. Very kind. Any married ones now? Oh, yeah. How many? I'm working on one now. But the unmarried, the unmarried… they're a disaster. They always talk about marriage. You're missing the fundamental idea: You must be married to be in the game. I like my freedom. Play along: Put on the ring and go do it. Try it. What a harvest you'll get! You have a garçonnière? A what? He asked if you have a bachelor flat. Dammit. This ear always hurt. All day driving with the window open. Try a hearing aid. The American ones are small. Yeah, thanks, I'm only 38. By the way, who will get to forty first? Radio silence! Look at these two girls. Swiss style. Look how she peels her pear. Classy. What do you think they are? Twenty-one and twenty. - Twenty thousand? Or more? - Please. More. No way, that cute face? So naive! Nowadays, one can't tell. That's true. I'll ask the the waiter, then we'll know. I got this! No, let's put it here. I want to give him a heart attack. I don't want to miss the look on his face. - A hundred thousand. - Are you sure? For the two of them? Yes. Women of the economic boom. What's this? No, forget it! This time it's my turn, remember how it went? If you insist. Don't look so quickly, idiot. So, what do you think? - Shall we approach them? - Boys… Now we need to pay for women? Sometimes. What matters is to have the money. - When do you leave? - In the morning, by car. - We're really leaving those two? - I'm on hospital duty early. - When do you return? - In two months. - Call me. - With pleasure. Excuse me. - What will you do next? - The theater. - How is your evening? - Gray. Hi, Gigi. There she is: the wife. A few years older, very elegant. What matters is that she has a million for every gray curl. - Franca, are you happy? - My name is Lucia. Sure, Lucia. The beautiful Lucia. Let's meet up one of these days. What for, Sir? To get spiritually close. I don't understand you, Sir. So let's meet up and talk it over. "Let's meet up and talk it over." You're no Cesarino. I'm not Cesarino, I know. "We must talk it over." No. He said, "We must absolutely talk it over." Right! I'll try to make my excuses and join you at the theater. Bye. I wanted to introduce my wife but the other two are bores and we don't have much time. The old one looks like the bank manager. That's him. - A friend of yours? - Friend and patient. Why not come to my home? A big new flat. We need launch it. No, I must be at the hospital at 7. And this dinner made me sleepy. We'll make that go away! - Wanna bet? - How? With women but let's hurry up. And who will pay? Why don't you call your dad? Why do you always annoy us? You are a great failure as a rich man's poor son. It's the parents who are greater failures than the poor son. Here they are: Female specimens in their environment. They didn't catch us and probably are pissed. And the 100,000? You won't get them through me because I work and you don't. Spare me the productivity sermon. If you're smart, even with no money… Sure, I'll show you. The Cesarino Method to soften lady motorists without spending a dime. Cute kids, I'm penniless, but ready to die for love! Idiots! You're no Cesare! You're no Cesare! Yes, but the method is good. Do you remember at the Missouri in 1949? It's not the method, but he who applies it. It takes a man! What am I then? If you want free women, go see Cesarino. Sure, but come too. You just want to see Cesare because he could get us ladies. Could he do much else? You've forgotten all he did for us. Stop taking him for a dreamer, an idealist, a poet. Shall we all go to the Luna to see him? And if he remembers your betrayal three years ago? Which one? Oh yeah, the 20,000 I had to lend him last time he called. I wasn't at home. Maybe he really needed that money. We supported him for so many years. One day, you must say enough. We were bastards for leaving him like that without contacting him again. - Then you too…? - Of course. And with no excuse. Even though, I moved to another city. Bastards or not, do we want to see Cesare? If he runs a cinema, he must know some pretty cows. Maybe we could pass by and watch him from a distance. To the women! Will he recognize you with that belly? My stomach's solid, athletic! My little Albert! Sir? No way! Then... then this is a reunion? But this… this is a summit, the UN! No, the UN is nothing to it. You, Livio, smart guy! How are you? And you, Mr Constructions? In my arms, Constructions! Are your jackhammers okay? And you, let me look at you. You're beautiful. He is beautiful! - Let's meet and talk about it. - Absolutely. We must talk about it. Come here. - Listen to me: We want women. - Four. A redhead, 2 brunettes, a blonde. Quickly, Alberto's leaving. - What women? - Females. Hey, you! You, tell the truth. - You were waiting for a discount? - Yes. Because Amilcare pays the same as a kid. Tell these gentlemen why. Because I'm senile, Mr. Cesare. And what's the difference between your house and an inn? At the inn, I have liquor, and at home, the witch. His wife. When she throw him out, he comes here to collect all the butts. - I gave you a contract, right? - Exclusively. Thanks, Mr. Cesare. All my life, I've stolen. But I still stayed poor. Good evening, gentlemen. Amilcare has a small flaw: He sometimes grabs a wallet. Right, Amilcare? Where do honest people keep their wallets? Same as you, Mr. Cesare: Far from their hearts. Cesare! Some water, please. Some water. Cesare! Sorry, Uncle, I'm coming. Your liver again? Yes, but I'm going strong. What is it? Do you know what he makes with his drinks? 5000 per day. 5000 net! He's good, right? - Do you get a commission? - No. Look, I don't like these jokes. Send him away. We need to be the one selling. Poor Cesarino, at that pygmy's beck and call. Poor uncle who has him as a manager. These buildings are standing only for the flees, bedbugs and crabs. - Get him out and wake up! - Sure, Uncle. Let's go! At that coffee shop, a Friulian cashier, a gorgeous bastard race. Yes, Cesarino, a Friulian! Remember that during '15-'18 war, I repeat '15-'18, no Friulian gave herself to the German invader. Five liqueurs! How much? Go on and tell me. Did you hear that? He's paying. Paying for real! We have a salary, right? A small good salary. - Got meat on this wallet? - A small steak. You're from Friuli. - How do you know? - Intuition. Tell us about your family life. Tell us your wedding night in colorful details. Was she a virgin? A honeymoon offered by an uncle at the Oropa sanctuary, OK? - How did you meet? - While selling mineral oils. But you didn't sell! She was the niece of a client, who was an expert in mineral oils. He refused the oils and introduced me to his niece. A quick seduction? The subject is indecent. It was mystical. Lots of religion. - Parochial. - Oh, God! She probably sees asceticism in you. - You think so? - That's why she loves you. And sexually, how is she? Come on, describe it. She loves the sea. We go often. I said sexually! - Nino! - It's just a question. Explain one thing to me. Why didn't you tell us you got married? Should I have? You get married without our approval: well done. If you had told us, we would've got you out. What's wrong with your liver? Nothing really. If my uncle thinks I'm sick, he's nicer. One day or another, he might really fire me. - No. - Believe me. Cesarino, you are screwed! Come on, let's get out of here. But I have roots here. And I'm deputy director. We could do something. I have no time. No time! Here are my bosses, look! Families, thieves, retirees, men, women... Good evening, Mr. Cesare. Teddy boys, beggars... In 1952, a guy didn't know where to sleep because his father had thrown him out. Where did he find shelter for a year? In your garage, dear Sandro. I provided you with shoes. My dad's, but still… Me, two suits. And Albert's silent. The one who helped you the most. Indignation has made him speechless. Are you indignant? You always said you wanted to see what's at the end of the road, eh? It's true. After a turn, there's always something new. A woman... - Alright, I'm coming. - Great! - The waitress? - He can do better. Wait. The girl on Tram 18... - Gianna the milliner! - Let's go. A pale person, 62 kg, number 6-8-4-2... Call quickly! He still got it! Let's see… "Dear Gianna, a lost dream…" - Do you remember her? - Small, firm, blonde braids… Small? "I thought of you…" Gianna? Gianna, honey, it's me. Cesarino, pretty Gianna. Big eyes, cute mouth, teeth, gold hair, remember at the hydro port? Behind the bushes, lying on the sport papers? Yes, do you remember? Yes, I wanted to call you. I was going to do it in 59, but I got seriously ill. I've suffered so much! It's been hard, Gianna. Honey, do you remember when I bit your earlobe? The earlobe, remember? Remember, my love? An unforgettable trip, some nights when you said, "No, not like that, or you'll kill me..." "You're killing me..." Yes. Listen, Gianna... So? The day before yesterday, she had twins. Another call and we'll ask if they're boys or girls. She can't watch love movies. She gets emotional. - Giulia! She cries non stop. But I want to watch them! Tomorrow too. Starting tomorrow, you'll only see the ones I choose. Let's keep calm... This is my wife. And these are my friends. Nino. - Livio, Sandro. - My pleasure. - And he is... - Alberto. The one from Rome. He always talks about you. We also have a little sister. A bit retarded, right? Weak intelligence quotient. Don't cry. You will find great love. Childhood dreams evaporated. Shh, defeatist. You'll find it and I'll kiss you. On the mouth though. We're leaving. I hope to see you soon. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Come here. - What? You salute other people but nothing for me? You are wonderfully tender. I really want it tonight. Tonight dress up for me in that long white nightgown and your hair down. All of it, eh? Every little bit. Mr. Cesare! Mr. Cesare, there's another one! In the third row, with glasses! Many of our clients are gay. Mr Vinelli? What are you doing with your little hand? Follow me. - You're farsighted. - Me? You don't know it yet but you'll see better from afar. Here you go. Stay here, okay? So alone yet so cute. The leopard is perfumed! Good evening, Mr Cesare. Not bad! When I was young, when this kind of girl would go out… smack! Not because she was blonde but out of principle. - Blonde and pretty. - Cesarino, you've given up. You should go see your uncle and give him the raspberry. He wouldn't like it. Let's keep it simple. I'd like to eat up the blondie. - A person of interest? - I'd like to talk to her. What was the name of the volcanic redhead? - Rodolfa. - Yes! The local lottery seller. - 7-90-9-47... - Call, let's try. Hello? My little Rodolfa! Is that you? This is Cesarino. Who? Cesarino. Don't you remember? The one that seduced you behind the lotto counter in 1958. Do you remember? I fought to get you, you didn't want to. I said if anything happens, I would marry you. - I swear I would have. - Well done. I swear I would have. Really but we never met again. So, are you a model or did you find a hot husband? What's wrong? Crying? What's wrong? What's going on? Who is this? Line control. Hang up the receiver and count to 10. One, two, three, four, five, six... What are you doing? He said count to ten. Husband. Disappointment. Wait, what was the name of the tall blonde, Who always said "Cesarino, pig!"? - Lara! - Yes, Big Lara. Huge, a bit vulgar, but pretty. Very pretty. A sullen person, resentful, unsociable. - Too sociable. We all screwed her! - I didn't. - A small appendicitis scar. - And a mole. Big Lara is enough for the three of us. She wouldn't want to see us. - He brought him in the bathroom! - Oh no! You're hurting me! I swear I won't do it again! You always say that but you're still offering ice cream to kids. How about we go to the police station? If you report me, I'll kill myself! Come. Come on, Mr Vinelli. Go home and come back whenever you want. You are a man of worth, a corrupter, a scholar. But keep that hand down! And leave the kids alone. Go bother soldiers instead. They can defend themselves, even break your nose. I'm sorry, but with these guys I become old fashioned. That didn't bum you out, did it? You haven't gone over… to the other side? Not that I know. - You still like it? - It's still necessary. That's good to know. We talk about women, but in reality… We should've hooked up with that restaurant pair. I remember Nevers... I was born in Nevers, I grew up in Nevers, I learned to read in Nevers. And in Nevers, I was twenty years old. That's what the actress says, right? Good evening. - You know him? - I never seen him before. Run and talk to her about Japanese movies. Go! Where are you going now? If you want to find poetry, it's only in Japanese movies. - Have you seen Rashomon? - Yes, my favorite director. It certainly is good. But the credit goes first to the story's author written in… 1924, from a popular tale. With a touch of Pirandello. Exactly! - Are you a friend of the manager? - Yes. One day we talked a lot. He's a nice guy, a little melancholy. Melancholy? Cesarino? Well, I barely know him. Why don't we see the city? Nobody should be alone tonight. I know tomorrow the world will end. - You'd like to pray? - Why not. Then you really should be alone. Some nights, we want to meet somebody. A romance novel? Yes. You're married, right? A married man guarantees a flirtation within reasonable limits. Where are you going? To a boring party with friends. But first I must go home and wait for a call. Is your place nice? You want to see my stamp collection? Japanese? I can show you my house, if you like. From the outside. Guys, he's a friend. Say hello. Good evening. I can't go to the party. - Want a lift? - Thanks. Give my excuses to the others. See you tomorrow. They weren't happy. They're just boys. He hit the jackpot and we won't see him again. I don't want to, is that clear? Why did we come up then? I'm waiting for a call. A lie. Yes, I am. You're a girl who lies. And you're a deaf gentleman. I told you to wait and you came upstairs. Why do guys always act like this? You can't even wait one day, five minutes... No, enough is enough. You can't act like this. These things must mean at least something. Listen to me, wait... I already did it once without thinking at a bad time, and you can't even imagine what a fiasco that was. Dammit! I keep on talking… and you only think of one thing. Sandro, look who's coming: The Leopard. Miss, didn't you like the movie? FYI: You need to be fast, if she gets home late, her brother hits her. She's waiting in the car. Perfect! - Not three. - Wait here. - Who am I waiting for? - For Cesarino, stay. Learn to keep quiet or my uncle will fire you. Get it? Laugh, be happy and he'll say you're doing well. Say... Will Alberto make it with that girl? - Alberto? - Yes. Yes, and how! By the way, Alberto, didn't you forget your friends are waiting for you? No. But you're coming with me, right? You like Bellini? No more kisses. I don't feel like it. Shall we stay together tonight? Yes, but don't kiss me. If you want to instead, we can go see the city by car. Would you like that? You're angry, aren't you? No... Listen, I know it was all a bit rough. Don't apologize. You did it, it turned out that way, and that's it. Come on. Don't look like that! Let's stop talking about it. Shall we go? You know what we'll do? When we get there, I'll say hi and then we'll go on our way. Would you betray them for a woman after so many years? What a shame! Afraid I will find someone nicer than you? Am I just nice? Be content with that. Hey, Councilor! Hello. What a big blonde! From the Cesarino Agency? - Yours is lovely. Well then? - What? Look me in the eyes: Yes or no? Look to your blonde. Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf. Who will you play with? him or me? I don't know. I have to see my brother. Forget the brother! - Isn't the gentleman coming... - Calm. ...Cesare. Mustaches, who is this coffee for? - Cesarino. I'll bring it to him. Tell me, did you score with her? Knock it off! Now you too? Yes, you said that before, but how old are you now? Mr Manager. I'll call you back. Let's get fresh material. Find or invent another girl. Call a random number. One who is always laughing. Let's try... 7-7-8-9-5-4? Good. - He's calling a stranger? - Let him do, you'll see. Hello! Hello! Hello? Miss, are you there? - Which one? - The youngest. Tina, it's for you. I don't feel well. Who is it? At this time? What's the idea? Who is it? Raoul. Who? - Listen... - Who's this? Please, continue. Who is this? Raoul. A sad person. Raoul who? Do you live at Via Porpora? No, 10 Scarampo St. Absurd! We must absolutely talk it over. Let's meet and talk about it. These days you look sad. I saw you when you went to work. Melancholy covers your face. You're unhappy. Are you about 1m 68? 1m 69. A friend and I saw you yesterday in a dress... The green one? Exactly. You know how tough women can be on each other, but my friend admired you. "How elegant." she said. To be honest, right now, I'm not at my best. No, you're just right: chubby with full thighs? Unfortunately, I'm never been able to lose weight there. A beautiful full thigh! I'll go if you get vulgar. Who are you? Where do you work? At the Lombard Plastics. To think that a girl like you, not yet 25 years old, is in a cement cage during the day. You're 25, right? 24. With the threats of a boss, and the cowardice of they, who when a young girl arrives, think they can do anything. I understand well: I want to break a lamp on their heads. You know desk lamps… Does he exist? He who? He, your he. Does he exist? Well... He does and he does not. Is there intimacy? You're going too far. But this man, is he up to the task? My god... When you're in his arms, when you're close to him, whether worthy or not, let's be frank, and let's say it once and for all, what do you feel? Well... Total abandon? Sorry? I said "total abandon"? To be honest... Do you do it every day? Some days, I do… some days not. - But who is this? - Raoul. - Who are you? - The opposite sex. Do you have a dresser? Pay attention, eh? I don't just mean any old dresser, but a real dresser. Because I realize, as soon as I get into a house even without talking to the family, if the house, in fact, has a dresser. Let's meet and talk it over. You've something to say. I can feel it. And I have something to tell you. Things that somehow relate to your dresser. In 20 minutes, I'll be at your house. I have a head wound. Are you hurt? An accident. I'll tell you about it. - No, I must go to my brother! - Be nice. Let's try these glasses on. If my brother knew, he'd hit me! We're fed up with your brother! A tragic accident took from me what makes every man proud. Condemned to sterility, but in recompense, I have them. Do you know "the beast with two backs?" - What's that? Explain it to her. Maybe she already knows. - What a beautiful night. - Let's go! Stop! Park here. Why? What's wrong? - Stop. - Where are you going? Just a second. - What are you doing? - My yogurt. I get one every night. Ridiculous. Turn around and close your eyes. Hey you two! Are you engaged? Hi, Fioretta. How are you? I lost a tooth. And I have white hair, look. Are you getting old? Will you close, Maria? Yes, I'll close. Good evening. Good evening. I have to talk to you. He asked me to marry again. He would take care of her. He wants to but not you, right? I have to, we two never have a cent. It's not your fault. Hey, are you arguing? No, honey, we're talking. And at school, all her friends have a dad and she doesn't. Do you think about that? But then, to that guy, you already said yes? He's opening a bar in Sesto. It's a job, it's the future. I'm not doing it for myself, but for her! Listen to me! It's for a steak for Fioretta. Fioretta is growing. She'll need many other things. So she can call someone else dad. Listen, if you really must marry him, couldn't we still be close? Vittorio isn't that kind of guy. So at least leave me the kid. Then I'd never see her again! You can see her whenever you like. Vittorio's jealous. He says you must get out of my life. Get out? Does Vittorio think I should shoot or hang myself? He doesn't say it to be mean. Me, you and Fioretta, we'll meet. I swear! Just a yogurt, eh? Gentlemen, the shop hours are over. We're closed. We can't leave you alone. That's true. Come, Fioretta. Button your coat. I'll go see my uncle. I'll ask him for a raise. Poor Cesarino. Say goodbye to dad. Goodbye, Dad. How could you end up like this? I don't get it. Getting stuck twice. Don't you see they're ruining your life? But I love them all. I love that girl there too. Nineteen, pretty… but you think I should keep her my whole life? Why not? What? Cesarino! I wouldn't lose a girl like Carla. Sure, you're available to everybody. You split yourself in threes, fours, but in the end, you screw yourself. Spending too much, you end up poor. My little Albert! What's the matter with you tonight? Hey, tell me, at what age did you get her pregnant? At sixteen? I gotta go back to the theater. You said you'll stay with us! The Sad One awaits me! My lady! You won't ruin our night, will you? - I need a raise. - Will you get it? No. To hell with him and his theater then! Instead of useless talk, why don't you lend him a hand? Is it a money problem? Of course. We'll give it to you. Of course! Give us a number! We're here to help you! - How much do you need? - My friends! - Of course, like before! - A job? Sandro! He'll offer you a job at his company! Sure, I'll give you a job but let's move, my ear's killing me! Let's go! Let's go see Nino's conquest. Nino with a girl? I gotta see that! You'll see, don't you worry. I will jump on her! Jump on her! At first sight, you'll disorient and stun her! Watch me when she arrives, eh? I won't let her speak. And if she's ugly? Where did those guys go? Such a bore! Why the hell did I come here? Listen, I'm returning to Milan. Will we meet again? If you want. When do you return? I can come back for you. Within a week. You see because in a month I'm going to America. For a long time? Forever! Do you remember Donatella? Of course. Her house, third floor, the window lit up. Does she live there? Yes. Why didn't you two ever get married? Because I am a coward. Or smart. Shall we give her a call? - No. - Hey! I wanted to ask you a favor. That guy we saw, the bank manager, will you introduce me? I have a proposal for him. Nowadays, in Milan you can earn big money, if you're smart. - What do you say? - Alright. By the way, the blonde, if you're interested, I'll back off. No need, we can have fun together. Are you Raoul? I wish! I only go ahead and make inspections for him. What's that? One of those whalebone corsets? That thing, take it off right now! Luckily, I saw it before Raoul did! Please! Why do I have to take it off? Raoul's waiting, give it to me. To destroy yourself like that? Masochism! You women…! Women are their own worst enemy. I'll never understand them! Look at this stuff! Where's Raoul? Now, I'll show you. There he is. Look at him. That's Raoul. I could leave Milan and its bell towers. I could leave my life and even my wife. But I won't leave my machine gun! I'll hold her close to my heart. Each projectile is a candy to me. I chew it and I swallow it heartily! But I won't leave my machine gun! I won't say anymore or else: boom, boom! Tomorrow, do me a favor: come to court to testify for me. A false testimony? Super false! There was an accident, just say what I tell you. You'd save me money. He couldn't. He's incapable of repeating stories. He'll improvise his own. And if he improvises in court, you're screwed! Will you testify or not? Yes, little Sandro. You just have to say this, that and other thing. - I will say it. - What? This, that and other thing. Cesarino, you're an idiot. Absolutely! Chubby legs, you're beautiful! What are you playing at, big guy? By the way, how's your wife, at close quarters? Is the retard better? Let's not forget that we're in the presence of three young ladies. You know who Cesarino's nice wife reminds me of? Rosanna. Which one? Pirelli. She didn't look like much, but she had great qualities. A rhythm. Like some boxers. Those who are knocked out! Cesarino, let's talk a little about their wives now, eh? These cowards are dumb on the subject. The wife is sacred, eh? Only the sacred is sacred. Yes. How does your wife make love? Does she toss about, jump up, tremble, let out little cries? She hiccups. She hiccups! What does yours do, Livio? Well, we don't do it often. Don't you want to? I don't know, maybe we work too much. I don't want it much either. With my wife, of course! Be honest: You hate them. No, I don't hate her. There are a few things… My wife, for example, in the morning, when she drinks her milk, she makes noises with her mouth. Does yours make noises too, Livio? Let's talk about your tricks and the money you pinched from your dad to give to your jade. Love doesn't exist! It's a great thing... Holy cow! Sad but sadistic. A mustache remover. Why did you do it? Don't ask me why. Do you hate me? No, I like you, just the way you are, with your illogicality, typically feminine. How well you understand women! Why don't you drop the mask? Come on, confess. What don't you like about your wife? I can't stand her craze of quoting in foreign languages. Instead of saying, "I'm sorry to leave," she says, "Partir c'est mourir un peux" and I'd like to kill her! Very nice! You marry them and then you bad talk them. Please! Alberto, tell us about your wife. She's a perfect woman. Do you know her? No, but in my opinion she is. Alberto, are you jealous? It looks like it. Impossible. You share everything, right? Sure, women are a common good. Cato says so too. Why not? They always have been. Maria lives here! Stop! Stop! Pull over to the corner here! That house with poles! Swallowing another yogurt? Of her son's tears, I went to wipe! - That's Maria's window. - She can't marry Vittorio, tell her. There, we'll shake hands... Are you married? Yes. Then goodbye, Raoul. With me, it's all or nothing. Wait, I was joking! I'm not married. I'm a bachelor. 100% single and I'll prove it to you. Here's my ID card. What's written here? "Bachelor" which means single. Are you Nino or Raoul? Fake ID? Look, it's his wife! Yes indeed, it's her. His real wife with the retard. Now there will be drama. And that'll be the end of our night. Poor Cesarino. Let's plan something else. No way, guys! I don't want to miss this. Can you picture it: Cesarino, the wife, the mistress and the retard! No, we won't laugh at him. Maybe he'll need help? Let's not miss the shooting. C'mon! They're running over there. Stay here, cowards! Catch mom, catch aunt! I got you! Watch out, a child is escaping! Catch her, quick. Go to the left! Left! Right! Look, the kid's running away! Stop her! Put out your foot! That's not fair! Not the chair! I'll fall with the chair! Look, they're escaping! But we'll… Friends! Look how many uncles you have! I knew you were good. True friends. Let them in! Come! Come in! Cesarino, get the cake. You come to mom. Maria made a big fuss and called me up crying. "I'd rather die than marry Vittorio!" I still have a mad headache! - I'll get you an aspirin, Giulia. - Thanks, dear. Let's go, be good. It's late for children. - They're not poisoned. - Congratulations. - Why? - What does the police say? Nothing. We don't make such noise every night. So, we have a harem? Allah is great! Does Giulia live here too? No, at my uncle's house. I'm sorry, I'm all out. I'll run to the pharmacy. Too bad she lives there. - I have a pill. - Thanks. Salaam! Finally, you're leaving the cinema. A lot of it is because of you, you know? Shall I let down my hair like Maria? Yes... If Maria will put hers up like you. Dad! What's wrong? What do you want? I can't find the potty. Can't find the potty! Radio news. American astronaut Cooper will speak next Tuesday at both the Congress and US Senate. Cooper, after two days in Honolulu where he come from today, will reach Washington by Monday night. Don't say anything to Cesare. In Morocco, voting for yesterday's elections is underway. In a thousand years of history, this country has never elected a parliament. - Why don't you look at me? - I am looking at you. ...come from afar on foot, or on the back of a mule to the polling stations. For many live in tents or even outdoors at the foot of trees. You hurt me with that big nose! Now, go to bed. Cover up. The boy is cute too. - Close your eyes. - He's an angel. Like his mother. Isn't that yours? - Giulia's then? - Poor thing, she can't have any. Who's boy is it then? From me and a beautiful blonde. Yes, from Genoa. An employee at Shell, she left me for a rich man. Rich, but horrible. Now, she's in India, poor thing. I don't envy their life. Luckily, the boy has everything he needs here. We all love him as if he was ours. Come, shall we get going? They're waiting for us. Are you leaving already? Stay. - Thanks, maybe another time. - With pleasure. We'll make a nice meal for everyone. And your wives too. It's an excellent idea. - We'll be back with our wives. - Sure. Tell me, Cesarino, that guy there... who is he? A guy. A guy. Well, I get it. Have you ever seen such a thing? Philosophy applied to life. It's incredible, eh? I think it's very believable. - You smoked. - It's his fault. He said, "I'll give you a cigarette, if you kiss me." Me? Go to bed, vamp! This house is an island of love. A poor man's harem. Poor, but still a harem. Hey, tell me, the two women are… friends? Truly. Cesarino... But... but which one do you love more? Both equally. Tell me this: If you were forced to throw one off a tower, who would you choose? I'd throw myself. And how do you manage them? Do you alternate days? He does as he pleases, like the Mormons. - There's the uncle! - Uncle! Cesare! Cesare! Bye, Uncle! You scream so loudly. Carla says that you don't dare change. - Tonight, everything will change. - Well said! Anyway, Cesarino... your wife's no great beauty, eh? She's no Callipyge, like the Sad One. What am I? A Venus Callipyge, it means you have a nice… No, if this is what we're sinking to, I'm getting out. Well done! She's right. Because you don't get it that this one here isn't a girl you can treat like that. Fiery words! Don't look at my cleavage, please. It's my weakness. I wish I didn't have them. - What? - My breasts. They all look at them. Even when you talk, they stare here. I thought she was talking. Such eloquence this girl has! And where are you going? To my brother! - Too bad, we're going to Pino's. - Alright. Here we are, crazy people! Get out! Stop! Pino turned on the neon sign! - Let's cross! - I'll block them. Officer, is it this way? All clear! Women and children first! Pino! Here we are! Ham dinner, ham dinner, still got it? I got it! Where've you been hiding all these years? And now, gorgonzola. Let us see your pretty face! Pino, look at all these faces! Take a good look at them. What do you see? They look the same. But no, Pino! Now they are successful men! Really? - Yes! Really? Yet they come to Pino's? To the table! Our society has laws that go back to the Babylonian Emperor Hammurabi! - I see the anarchists are still here. - Should I throw him out? Better get rid of this Picasso. Are you playing the intellectual? Goodbye, dreams of glory! Look at this! When this guy sings, I get goosebumps. Good, Cesarino, sing. On my desk, I chase monotony in vain. Everyone in their place! As if it were yesterday. What a memory! - Who was here? - An important lady. Right, Cesarino? Her name was Lara. She was so striking they called her Big Lara. Hot. - Have you seen her again, Pino? She's gone, Cesarino. Was she beautiful? Many businessmen wanted her hand, but she loved Cesarino. Oh, yes. Once she even shot him. We were in a park the fall of '53, in her green car. She put a hole in the door and my gray wool coat which she had given me. Did she want to kill you? She did not believe in a sudden decrease in virility. Said I was lying. Were you? His system for dumping the obsessed ones. Only to convince her to be nice to his friends, right, Livio? From a female point of view, she was right to shoot you. She was beautiful. Blue Angel style, long legs and a huge heart. Sometimes, just to meet her, I went to her hairdresser. - You too? - Why? Did you too? I dreamed about her every night! Did you love her too? We were alone in Ferragosto. Milan was deserted. In my arms, she asked about you. It was humiliating, you know? Sure, Lara was exclusionary. I tried to make her understand. That you to love, you needed to go wide… To love me is to love my friends. Look at that: Man reduced to his animality. True, disgusting, isn't it? Is he your friend? Not really. I barely know him. You're not like him, are you? You know how to wait? Me? Then you didn't understand anything. Listen, I have to apologize for this morning. I pretended not to see you. Why? I don't know, Sandro. Maybe because of all that passed time. I don't know. Please! - Why are you biting my ear? - I like that. You like to bite ears? Madly. Don't look at my breasts. I'm not. I'm admiring the sequins, the pearls. Nice! Pino, you hear everything! Cesarino, sing. Come on, sing. I can't sing. And why not? Because the Sad One doesn't love me. Right, Sad One? But I do. Hey, Sad One, why don't you love him? You like someone or you don't. So much energy this girl! Cesarino, you lack willpower! You haven't done anything right. Nothing good. As a salesman, instead of selling oil, you goofed off! And the clients? They need to be forced. Life requires being aggressive. But how did you deal with them? "Do you want some mineral oil?" "No? OK, I'll be back." "I'll be back." "I'll be back." In life, you're always coming back! In this booming economy of Milan, you are a fool, Cesarino! And the song? You're singing. You're even singing. You are a failure, Cesarino. Instead of singing in class, you would yell to make people laugh. You were wrong in everyway! And now? When a friend asks you for a little favor, a little false testimony in court, you hesitate, you scare him and don't reassure him! What kind of friend are you? Is it so hard? Go to court and say what you must to help your friend! You just have to say, "That one's to blame." So what if he's innocent? It doesn't matter. Do it for a friend, Cesarino! It's a friend who asks you! Sit down, fool. Come on, Cesarino, sit down. In love, do you pay attention to details? I'm worth nothing. I am an amateur. Is she a whore? No, a girl of a good family Her parents are in the USA. You see, meeting someone like you brings me closer to Him. You'll be next to the Father in the Final Judgment. Definitely. Will you be severe? We shall judge case by case. And us? You'll be forgiven. But remember this: Be careful. What do you mean? Everyone be careful. Please, everyone be careful! Even you down there! Your voice is one of the truths, contemplated and anticipated. Your voice is not from today but from tomorrow. Remember that the voice is the essence. - We're going out. - What a beautiful couple! The last one will be the word "crack". It will be THE voice. God will know if the word has been said in one form or another. Because the voice is everything! Substance, finesse... You can't sing every day! It was as if a philosopher, I mean a wise man, were to speak every moment. Right! That's why I never sing at 8:30 am. That's it! You haven't got "positivism" yet! Alright? We always love together. We were raised like that. One day, with a bolognese... I'm from Casola Valsenio. The land of Alfredo Oriani. From a dividing line, he did his side and I did the other. But some things are for two and some things are for one. For example? For example the mouth, see? We can manage it. Would you go with an intermittent woman? Do you know the damage she'd do? Throw her out! Instead, you have a very intelligent lady here If you can find one like her, you'll be fine. - You recommend her as my type? - Yes. - Why? - She's perfectly aligned with you. She has a musical mind. If you sing, she listens and you can continue. - Would you recommend the one with the musical gift? - Yes! And not the busty, full, open and provocative one? No! America has bowling. Forget America, don't go. But I have to go! It can't end like this, can't you see? Alberto, don't take seriously what's not serious. My father forbid me to quit. The shop manager saw an opening and jumped on me. A drama of need. Seduced on the couch? On the writing desk. Since then, I hate men. - Did you have many? - Yes but I hate all of them. Livio? Where are we are taking these for the coup de grace? No idea, Cesarino will find a place. The boys seem to be having fun, right? Remember when you used to yell "We're closing" and we'd be left alone? With the girls? You think they'd like to do that? Yes, I think so. Perfect then. We're staying here. - Waiting? - My boyfriend's coming. We're staying here. - What did he say? - You're staying here. - Does your ear hurt? - It's no big deal. Let's go back to your place. Why? We'll be alone. We can get to know each other better. And if things go even worse? Do you believe that? Yes. Oh, no… Can't you see the moment has passed? Very well. In that case, you want to go home alone? If you want. I'll call you a taxi. Alright. Come on, don't look like that! Laugh! We must have fun together. Stay with me. To start talking seriously again, right? I need to talk to you. I'm going through a rough patch. - Why? - Many reasons. Nothing exceptional. These things happen to everyone. With my wife, we've nothing left to say. I know what we'll say tomorrow, New Year's Day, at Christmas, at Easter, for my birthday and for hers. Carla, I'd like what we did to have made sense. And I'm sorry I did it that way. You think you're the only one who decided everything? I knew very well we would end up in my room. "You can't even wait one day," "Not even five minutes." So, that's your alibi? I'm too young to need an alibi. I'm young, understand? My room is still full of toys. Don't take me seriously, even if I talk seriously. - I understand. Great. - Listen, Alberto, you're an interesting man, but I'm curious about everything: Certain people, encounters, voices... I thirst for life. And you joke about everything. I'm 19, I can't get tied down. It always seems that we can find something better, something different. Come on, don't hate me. Of course not. And now what are you thinking? Who interests you? Him? Not that one. That one... no. Him, yes. Cesarino, come here. Alberto doesn't want to believe that I'm only 19. Yes, you're the type who puts her hair up to look more… 22 or 23 years old. Or even 24. If you only knew what a great man our dear Alberto is. For many years, I had a hard time earning my bread. And who helped me? He did. But he did it in such a way, as if I did him a favor. Carla wants to go home. No. I don't want to anymore. Then, go dance. You like that filly? Skittish! Let me look. What's this wrinkle? You care about her? - No way. - You can't hide it. But I do approve. She's as good as gold. But if anybody wants her, like you… I'll get her back for you. Don't you dare do it! - You'll see. - Don't you even try! OK. OK. Can I dance with your angel? Just dance? Even more, if you want. You're the only one who doesn't hit on me. - Well, you look like my wife. - Your wife? Yes, you two would get along. Why? You are from the same mold. Sweet Carla, will you give me a dance after? Excuse me, Sir. Regards, Cazzaniga. Oh no, he's full of problems. He saturates me with words, I assure you! Be honest. Didn't you start by being difficult with him? But he likes difficult. You see how he is. He reads, studies, he's sensitive, he goes full blast. Instead of laughing, go to him and snatch him away. You can start all over with no problems this time. You know, you're quite the good pimp? For the happiness of my friends, I would do anything. Listen, have you ever taken a woman away from Alberto? Taken away, never. Shared, yes, with his permission. And did a woman ever prefer you to him? What a joke! Women see Alberto's value: Cultured, serious and he's nice, very nice. I'm going to kiss you. And I'll kick you in the shin. It's time to say good night! We're closing, ladies and gentlemen, it's late! We're closing! Come on, five minutes. My god... Where do we go now? We're staying here, darling. Have I made myself clear? Come on, move! I'm dying of thirst. Come on, Miriam! Miriam stays to please Sandrino. You can go with her boyfriend. - What are you doing? - What are we doing? - Pino closes and we'll have an orgy. - An orgy? Are you in? Come on, Miriam, come on. These guys are rotten apples. Do you know why this place used to be called the bullring? Do you know? I'm leaving, bye. Well then, shall we have an orgy? Here, Cesarino seduced Big Lara. Where? Come on, show her the spot. Outside, where we were earlier. Show me where you seduced Big Lara. I have accurate information about the Big Lara. She ended badly, very badly. I didn't tell Cesarino so as not to hurt him. Tell me, I'm already in a bad mood. I'm kidding, tell me all. She was in prison for two years. Right after you all left her. For a little jewelry theft. Lara? Didn't she have a bank account? Bank accounts, my dear, we know how they start, but not how they end. If you're not careful, he'll screw you out of the minor. And what will you do later? Stay and watch? Yes, I'll watch. Beat it! Who gave you this stuff? It's a tonic, not a drug. Either way, don't overdo it. The mustache of a man and the eyes of a child. What a strange meeting ours is. What do you have in your mouth? A pill, a tablet to suck. It sits under the tongue. Must I stay down like this? You are obedient and good. I'll end up ringing like a bell lying like this. Yes. A man can be happy with you. You have no thoughts. You take no initiatives. You are harmless. - Even. - Odd. Shoot! - How much? - Two. I won, pay up. And now? So pretty. Ravishing. If only you had seen me before my son. - You have a son? - Yes. - Really? - He's two. How could you talk about kids now? Now I can't! It turns me off. - You know you're the handsome one? - Me? Yes, the most youthful. Don't say youthful. Youthful is sad and depressing. Say young. Young is beautiful. Young. No, not the guepiere. - Why not? Let's talk about it. - No! And then Lara sat down there at that table. It's frozen. It was summer. And then? And then we went over there, in the back, in that shack. And then? And then that's it, crazy girl. Give me your hand. You know you're better than them? Come on, you know exactly what they are. Tell me. Mediocre. I made you sad. Forgive me. Would it bother you so much to start over with Alberto? I was wrong. I always make mistakes. I go through with it. He wanted to be the great seducer and I let him do it. At the end of the day, I always do what other people want. Like you, right? But what is going on between us right now… is way more important, way more beautiful. Go home, go. I want to stay with you. Go back home. How your eyes sparkle! What do you want from me now? What are you doing? Damn, I forgot to pay the electricity! What are you doing? We can't do that here. I'm a weak woman, I give in and then I regret it. Everyone here can see us. I'd love to be close to a lake, a field, trees and birds that sing. Don't you? When do you close, Pino? As soon as those two leave. My "vunderful" baby! Shut up, drunk! Am I bothering you? Don't hesit... No, let me say it again, am I bothering you? Answer me. Am I bothering you? Do you know who I am? I'm Jimmy the Bull. Stay calm, Bull. You shut up! Say that to me again, just once, "drunk." Nobody has ever called me that! - Control yourself. - Please, nothing bad will happen! You must tell me precisely... - Let's go home! - Buzz off, Mirella! - ...call me a drunk. - Not me. No! You must call me a drunk again, got it? You gotta have the courage to call me that outside! You must walk on outside and on the sidewalk call me a drunk! Or I'll give you two black eyes, got it? Bull! Bull! Who was that? Bull, you don't know how to sing in English. One doesn't say "vunderful". You must say "wonderful". We don't mind seeing our friend smashed to bits, but if you keep saying "vunderful", we'll bust a gut. Try to say "wonderful," Bull. Yes, it's alright, it's alright. Swallow that, Bull! Bear it, Bull! Bury it, Bull! Son of a bitch! I love to sing in English! Why can't I sing? Holy cow! I work 12 hours a day! And you come to tell me how I should sing? I always sing in English! Why can't I anymore? I'm going to break everything now! Your face, the chairs and the paintings! Where are you going? I'm going home, he's crazy! But no, wait! What do you know about workers? What do you know about the foundry? Calm down, Bull. Calm. Sing, sing in English. You're right, sing all you want. Don't hurt yourself. - Mirella! Shake hands, let's make up. You're shaking. Mirella! She left. Good! Mirella, you are...! Go away, old bag! I'm coming back tomorrow with a 16-year-old girl! It'll be my birthday. You're a gentleman. You said "Shake my hand, you're shaking." But that other one… Is he your friend? He offended me. He called me a drunk. You get me. I was with a girl I cared about. And that idiot called me a drunk so I... Bull, do you have a motorcycle? - Yes, a Morini. - Wait for me. A single cylinder. - Get up, honey. Where do you gotta go? - To my brother. Fine, let's go: a meeting of the heavyweights! Here, Bull: 90kg, blonde, adult and she needs to go home. I am not a… a parcel! I must pay. You hardly drank anything. The chairs... Pino will pay. I'll pay for them. Forget it. She's all yours, Bull. Take her and bring her home. Where are you from, Miss? From Belluno. I'm unshaven, I work at night. Thanks! - Bye, Pino. Sorry. - Bye, Bull. What a client, this one. Bravo, Cesarino. If the senile pays half ticket, you'll get in free. You don't understand. In less than half an hour, under a ladder, in a secluded spot, the blonde and the bull will make passionate love. Isn't that marvelous? Isn't that "vunderful"? And you are Raoul? Raoul my ass. You wanted me to go after a drunk? Yes, Jimmy's the bull, but Nino's the mind. - To hell with that. - A fine client he was. Sad one, you're a bit tired. And nervous. You want a drink? You enjoy mocking. Why did you say those things on the phone? Because, because girl, what do you know about life and love? You know it all, eh? You don't know how you hurt people! You lie and upset them! You open a ray of hope, and then nothing: it's a joke! Please stay. We're all friends here. Don't you feel the warmth of friendship? Don't you feel this warmth? You're a crazy man, that's what you are! Even if I liked your sentiments on the phone. And now she'll cry. That's all we need! Why? Why do you do these things? If you leave, we'll be sad. So, stay if you want. Everyone has their own morals. Come on, little girl! You? You're half bald. Me? You're short! You sweat! I knew there was nothing, neither on the inside or out! Really... "Neither on the inside or out!" That was a good one! A good one! Cesarino, the brunette got scared and ran away! No! She too? They left us! We only got this bike! Wow, let's all get on the bike! Here comes the bull! Picador! The bull was nice, eh? He was so nice when he said, "I was with a girl I cared about: Mirella!" "Let me sing in English!" You have to say it in Milanese! "I work in a foundry 12 hours a day and I want to sing in English!" - Oh, God! - I can't anymore. What a beautiful evening. And I, for an evening like this, would give my life. An evening with Nino, with Livio, with Sandro and with Alberto! Friends, Viva Zapata! Viva Zapata! - Quiet! They'll complain! - Let them complain. Zapata is still Zapata, and tonight won't end like this! And how should it end? We'll go to sleep. Did you see Alberto's face? Didn't you see he's annoyed? You're annoyed? I had a great time but it's late and I must leave in the morning. Lets go to bed! Because the ladies ran away? If that's the only reason, I'll get… more beautiful ones than those… Pino? How long does it take for Cesarino to get women? Depending on the time of day and season, one hour. No, half an hour. If I can't get fresh ones in a half hour, never look me in the face again! Now you're talking! Let's go! I feel like new! Leave her be. Don't talk to her anymore. She'll come back wagging her tail. Hurry to the car! Another round, come on, guys! You see? She's young and foolish. Let's go, Cesarino. Wait up for us, Pino! I'm waiting, I won't move! But I won't leave my machine gun! I'll hold her close to my heart! Look up! Guys, check it out! - Dammit! - So beautiful! An true Ethiopian. And that profile: magnificent. A primitive race, a queen. Just look at her! I've always dreamed of a black woman. Come on, Cesarino, do something! I can speak their dialect. Miss! Ozola sala bolingo. What are you saying, Nino? "Let's flirt in the field" in Congolese. Don't you dare let her get away, Cesarino! Hey, If you start off too fast, I'll lose my hand. What? What the hell? Hi, Lancelot. Let go of her hand! My client! I operated on his gallbladder! Unbelievable, what is this? Noob! Oh, yeah? It won't end here! No way! It won't end here! But I won't leave my machine gun! I'll hold her close to my heart! Each projectile is a candy to me. I chew it and I swallow it heartily! Listen, get out and we'll talk! How's your liver, Lancelot? Lancelot, my ass! Are you making fun of me? Who do you think I am? Enough, Cesarino. Please stop! Who do you think…? Noob! Lancelot! We'll meet and chat about it! This ain't over! I won't let you go! Hey, are you still having problems with your gall bladder? Was the right side or the left? Bastard! Normally, it's the right. How about your memory? Hear me out, sometimes, you can't remember your name, right? Say, what's your name? Say it yourself slowly: Lan-ce-lot. What Lancelot? I'm Giovannardi! After making love, (which I recommend in moderation, OK?) don't you feel a weight here? - Stop! - It's a heart attack. Take it easy. You don't look so well! You're going wild! Those bags under the eyes don't lie! I demand an explanation! Stop or I'll smash your head in! Bye! But I won't leave my machine gun! I hold her close to my heart. Each projectile is a candy to me. I chew it and I swallow it heartily! Excuse me, is Cremona this way? - Damn! - Very kind. Go! - Dirty thugs, stop! - No, you need to stop! What are you doing? Let me go! I'll call the mayor! Stop. Professor, I didn't mean… - I said stop. - He's no longer in the mood. Did you hear me that I want to get out? Stop, damn it. Are you worried about your patient? - He didn't see you! - Enough! Don't ruin the party! He didn't recognize you. What party? I'm not amused anymore. - Professor, sorry. - Why? Didn't he want the exotic one? - Maybe, I overdid it. - His reputation is ridiculous! I pity you! Take my car home. You're right. - Why? - You're leaving me like… Look, I'm not introducing you to the bank manager. Why mention him? Just to be clear: I won't. - No? - No. I can't vouchsafe a guy who's always in court. Good night. Cuckold! If you want, I can give you your distinguished colleague's name. Stop! Quit it! Livio! Sandro, don't do it! Enough! Enough! Professor, don't be like that. And you, Sandro were just joking, right? Tell him. I don't care. Sandrino, be nice, apologize to the professor. He must apologize! I don't understand you. You like to have fun but you can't take a joke! Arguments, yelling, hate! Why can't you be like Cesarino? You don't understand. What? Nothing at all. Because joking, as he likes to do, always ends up with somebody left for dead. Like Big Lara. What about her? She's dead poor. In the early morning, you can find her on a street in the outskirts. She's a whore. With truckers. Who told you that? Pino told me. Which spot? On which street? The road to Rho. Why didn't Pino tell me? Why did you tell him that? That was ten years ago. If she ended up badly, isn't that her fault? Surely, not mine. I'm the only one who hadn't that honor with Lara. I was with her briefly. When Cesarino left her, Livio picked her up. But he's discreet, a gentleman, an orchid! You won't say anything, eh, Professor? There's still one more difference between you and me: I'm ready to face… that person, to ask her if I owe her anything. Perfect! Let's put it to the test! Because tonight, we're all masochists, right? Friends, I'm going to Big Lara. Sandro, are you coming? - Where? - To Big Lara. But it's half past four! I don't know why tonight, we decide to do one thing and end up doing another. They found her! What is it? Nothing. They found Big Lara but… we'll keep warm here, right? No, I want to see her. What do you think you'll see? This interests me. Aren't your feet frozen? Hey, thugs! Go back home! Go back to your towns! What do you want? To see me? Take a good look: It's me! Bye! What's the use of rising so early? Can't you sleep? Who was the idiot who told you where I was? Come on, Lara, don't be a child! Come down! Come here! Go on, heat up the machine. They're all coming back. - Who's coming back? - The gang. Can you explain why you run away instead of kissing me? What joy! The five of you, still together. Like it used to be, right? Congratulations! And who is the little one? Would you like a coffee, Miss? Hi Lara. How are you? Like a kiss. You were in San Babila 2 years ago, with a jewelry display case in your arm. Hi there, Doctor. Hi, Lara. Hi, handsome dark soul. Hi. Nino, you're the only one whose face shows what you really are! Look, don't pick on me! I don't feel like being picked on now. What made you look for me? They came to find me at the cinema. I run a movie theater, you know. Then, you can get me tickets Every day. Then we started talking about you. You were the only one not there. Lara, you haven't changed. A beauty, right? Have you seen my beautiful profile? Aren't you going to ask about this scar? What happened to your nose? An accident. Then plastic surgery. With a doctor who slaughtered me. She has a cute little nose. Congratulations. If only they had given me this out of jealousy. It's barely noticeable, you know? - Isn't that true? - Oh, no, it looks fine. A sad to sight to see, eh? So what? Why are you looking at me like that? This is no zoo. I'm sick of all of you already. Stay here, let's talk a bit. Of course, to be sure. Let's talk about it. What do you want to know? I work, I'm happy, I earn enough to live. And I'm in good health. Ain't that enough, honey? And above all, please, don't act like you don't how I earn my living. I couldn't care less. By the way, how is your health? Are you still impotent? It wasn't true, Lara. One of the many stupid things I told you. I hope one day it will be true! The sooner, the better! Lara, where are you going? I sit here and wait for the trucks to pass by. Let's leave this place. Do you remember how happy we were on Procaccini Street? I've often thought about it, you know? Look, if they see me with a man, they won't stop. Go away! But I still love you. Hark at that! A love declaration so early in the morning! I love you. Because you're beautiful. Yes, even if the years have passed. Even if your face is tired, even if your eyes no longer smile. A poet… Poet, I salute you! You're beautiful for everything you gave us. Because you suffered, you feared to be no longer able to give. But it isn't true, everything is more beautiful than before. Come on, stop. Yes, what you're giving us today is even more beautiful. Because it's pure gold. They, who don't understand it, are wretches. Cesarino… My dear. I'm so scared. You don't have to be. Yet, I am scared. You don't have to be, I'm here. We've met again. I wanted to find you! When something unites two beings, it lasts forever. Get away! You haven't changed, eh? Still clowning before your friends? - Clown! - Why are they standing there? You've always been a clown! You entertain them and they feed you! I swear, I didn't see them and they didn't come to laugh! They're still paying you, eh? Go ahead, do your number! Dance! Laugh! Have fun! Where are you going? Stay here! We must talk! Our friends have come to see you! Those things are my friends? They make me sick to my stomach, if you want to know the truth! Lara, if you want to insult us, tell me now and I'll go! That's it, Lara! Show us who you are! Now she's gonna start swearing. Don't provoke her. Nino, have you gotten worse or were you always like this? He got worse. You know what I think of you? You are all clowns! Always running after him, to pick up his leftovers! Like when he used to say to me, "Make love with them, the chumps!" I never said "chumps". Never. I'm coming! By the way, are you married? Then introduce Cesarino to your wives! Then call me, eh? It'll be my turn to laugh! Don't you see that you can't do anything? We were wrong to come. What would you know? I have to talk with her! He's crazy! He's chasing the truck! Goodbye. Quick, boys, let's reach him with the car! Let's go! Finally, something's happening! Be nice. Make them stop. - Come down, come with me! - Let me go! Come live with me, we'll start over. Come on, guys, stop! You don't know us! We love each other! I still do! I've nothing to say to you! Make him get off! I don't want him to touch me! Come on, speed up! Lara, you're not well. You were sick. You can't go on like this, you'll end up homeless! Leave! - Get out, I don't want to listen! - Listen to me! Come with me. Lara, come with me! - Get down! - Make him go! - Come on! - Make him leave or I'm leaving! - I have a room for you! - Keep it! - Come! - No! No, I don't believe you! You won't fool me again! Get out! Is your head empty? Come home now! If the police saw you, I would have gotten a ticket. Let it go! C'mon, we're already overloaded. Please, believe me! Come on, get off! See, you got hurt. It's no big deal. Drop it. We need to talk. Send him away! Away! He's a bastard! He was the one who ruined my life! He's a pimp! Don't you have to work? Go to work now. Me? Go to work? I own Milan. I'm a millionaire! Let me talk with her! - Get your hands off me! - Go home. Get your hands off, you're bothering me. Dammit, I need to talk to her! Just for one minute! Keep your hands of me! Keep them off! Dammit! You did it now. See? Are you happy now? You see what happened? Come on, be reasonable. Go back to your home. Go home and behave yourself. Come on, let's go. Beat it. Don't stop, let it go! C'mon! Listen to me, walk. Keep moving. You shouldn't go around provoking people. Gino, don't! That's enough! Gino! Carletto! Knock it off! Enough! Help! They're killing him! Carletto, I said stop! Let's beat it! Get your hat! Wait, Alberto, stop! Alberto, we can't! This will end badly, this will end with the police! Livio, tell him. Have we all gone insane? This will end with the police. You'll see, the police. What did they do to him? - Put him in the car, at least! - He can't walk. Over here then. Let's hurry! Quick! People are coming! It's empty inside here! Careful with the door. Over there. Nino, watch for anybody coming. Why didn't you stop them? Why didn't you help him? Why? He needs two stitches. Yes, a stitch in time… - Do you feel pain here? - No. And here? No, it's all here. - They broke it. - Let's go to the emergency room. The emergency room for a few punches? I used to box, you know. But the other guy did too. Christ, what a punch! But you though… Forget all about a girl like that! But not him! He always does what comes in his head! Quite the show! This could've ended worse, don't you see? When are you going to grow up? Me? Wake up. I say it for your own good. What should I do? You live as if there were no rules in life. Women, children here and there, everything easy, always laughing. But beware, because one day or another... What do you mean, Alberto? Never mind, forget it. To each his own, you know. No, say it. You know that when you speak, I listen to you. Then say it. Your women, for example. Giulia and the other one… What was her name? Maria. Yes, Maria. A fine joke. The harem. Years will pass and... Years will pass and? They'll get tired. Or you will. Either one of them will leave or someone will cheat. I say it for your own good. Professor, what's the matter? I'm disgusted. Of myself. Of us. Look, I was one who got punched, you know? Get him over there. Here. I saw it near the taxis. Come back to him. We've nothing left to say. Bye. Carla, are you leaving like this? For one moment, you liked they were beating him up. What? No! Yes. Even you, Alberto. And he knows it. But why? Because of someone like me? But I... I'm still his friend. Then… make him believe… that you were afraid. Scared of those thugs. He will believe you. If you say so, he'll believe it. But if he realizes that you no longer love him, it would destroy him. Promise me you'll tell him. Alright. Bye. Forgive me. Sandro, I'm sorry about the car. The damage... Don't worry, it's so old. I'll sell it. I'll sell everything. I'll close my business. Regarding that job, Cesarino, I don't know if… There's no need. I'm fine with the theater. Uncle is a good man. On Sundays, we go to the match together. - And the testimony? - He was kidding. Yes, I was kidding. Listen, if you need anything, something that might come in handy, I can give it to you. You can pay it back when you want. I'll figure it out. I must be at Warner Brothers in one hour. I have a movie to get to. I need to take care of my little cinema. I'm not good at anything else. Hey, today is my father's birthday. Before he goes to the factory, I could get some money. - Where's Carla? - She had to go. She took a taxi. Right now, my children are getting up. I have to take them to school. Here, they build and build. But the economic boom is over. It's obvious. - When will you be back? - Soon, but I'm not sure when. What's your number? 7-9-9-2-9-3. 7-9-9... I have nothing to write on. Do you have a pen? I had one, but I must have lost it earlier. Professor, can you bring me to the hospital? You're still at the theater, right? Always. Does your cheekbone burn? No, it tickles me. It makes me laugh. Want a ride? No. I just have to cross the bridge and I'm at Warner Brothers. But first, I have to call my uncle to apologize. And I must call home. Maria, Giulia. Well, goodbye. Next time there'll be something better than the Sad One! But where can you find another blonde like that? "I must go to my brother! Duh!" A pity. Why? We didn't get to talk. Next time, it'll just be the five of us. And we'll talk. All night. Alright? Alright. So, it's a deal? I'll call you. Yes. Call me. I cultivate the white rose, in July as in January, for the sincere friend who gives me his frank hand. For the cruel one who tears out the heart with which I live, neither thistles nor nettles I cultivate, END neither thistles nor nettles I cultivate, I cultivate the white rose.
