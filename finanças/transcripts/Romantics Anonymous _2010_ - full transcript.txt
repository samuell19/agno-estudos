With each step I feel more sure Everything will be fine I am sure The world is mine They'll see me shine For I truly believe in me I believe in me When the sun beams I believe in me When the rain streams I believe In the return of Spring And above all other things I truly believe in me Strength can't be measured in numbers Nor can wealth it is true But peaceful nights of restful slumber Mornings singing a gleeful number My heart is strong For it believes in me I believe solely in my belief in me And as it so happens I truly believe in... Hi. I'm Mimi, emotional. Hi, Mimi. Lately, I've been doing well. Everything's great. Excuse me. Sorry. I can't say no. Not even to telemarketers. Not to mention men. I can never say no. So obviously, I sleep around a lot. Thanks for sharing, Adele. Hi, I'm Angelique. Emotional. Hi, Angelique. ROMANTICS ANONYMOUS THE CHOCOLATE MILL Family Run Since 1896 Hello. Hello! Angelique Delange... chocolate maker. Angelique Delange, chocolate maker. Caring and sharing. Chocolate is sharing. Chocolate is nothing to be afraid of. That's good. Breathe. Good. You're not breathing. Yes I am! Hello. Hello, I... I came about... the ad. You're early. That's ok, I'll wait. Might as well come in. As long as you're here. It's warmer inside. The waiting room. Lovely! Oh right, sorry. Hi, boys! Adventure was always my dream Doing whatever I please Now that adventure is within reach Why am I so afraid? I can't do it. Miss Early Bird... Follow me. Don't let the boss intimidate you. Why? He seems mean at first. - And then? - Still mean. Sir? The first applicant for the job. Come to my office. Have a seat. Do you have experience? Of course. Because chocolate is a unique product. Indeed. Too many people think of it as sweet. When in reality, it's... Bitterness? - Sorry? - Bitterness sets it apart. Bitterness... in varying degrees, is what sets chocolate apart. You're very knowledgeable. It's important. I couldn't have said it better. Do you like chocolate? Everyone does. I mean, really like it? Yes, I'd have to... How many years' experience? I took classes at 18. But before... Before? Yes. It's been... We're bankrupt. Almost bankrupt. Oh, darn. We need someone like you. Really? Like me? Thank you. Wait here. She's the one. - Shall I send in the next applicant? - No. Suzanne... Do the paperwork, she starts tomorrow. - Are you sure? - Yes. And the others? What do I tell them? That she's the one. Exercise 7. Repeat after me: I am in peace I am centered I trust the future I am letting go I am embracing life I am a volcano I got a new employee today. But the phone rang during the interview. And? I hate phones. Not knowing who's calling. And this employee? Is she a woman? Yes. How do you feel about women? I have no problem with women. They terrify me, that's all. You don't like women? I love women. I know what you're thinking. You think if someone says he loves women, he means he wants to sleep with women. Not me. I mean, I do, but not only that. I really love women. I love their conversations, their lotions and potions... Everything. Ever been in a relationship? Never, no. Wouldn't you like to fall in love? I have an exercise for you. You will ask someone to dinner. Ask someone to dinner? I see. A man or a woman? Excuse me, should I bring my own apron or do you provide one? Why do you need an apron? You know, for... Sales reps don't need aprons. Aren't you a sales rep? Sure, of course. I've always been... a sales rep. Selling is my passion. My raison d'etre. I'm over the moon. Really. Having to talk to people, convince them... I thought they needed a chocolate maker, not a sales rep. After a sleepless night, my mind's made up. I absolutely must tell the boss, "Sir, there's been a big, big mistake. I'm not a sales rep. I'd be the world's worst sales rep." Are you busy Thursday? I'm taking you to dinner. Dinner? Dinner. Me? Is that a problem? No, but... You're not a vegetarian? Allergies? No. But I should tell you I'm... Tell me... Tell me what? I'm looking forward to it. It'd been ages since a man asked me out. I thought it'd never happen again. Something I say or do always seems to mess it up. So I didn't speak. Everything will be fine I am sure The world is mine They'll see me shine For I truly believe in me I truly believe in me Hello, I've come to show you products from The Chocolate Mill. The Chocolate Mill? Their chocolate is awful. It's not so bad. Aren't they bankrupt? Not yet. Between you and me... it's not very good. All the same, it's chocolate... with no frills. No frills? Would you like a sample? No. Ok. Thank you. I don't understand. Why won't anyone buy it? It's good quality. Go on, taste one. Seriously, very good quality. The texture is amazing. It resists just enough when you bite in. And it melts so subtly you hardly even notice. It melts by surprise. Doesn't it? Sorry. I got carried away. Chocolate is my life. I went to pastry school to become a chocolate maker. That was my dream. But if there was an exam, if someone looked at me or asked me a question, I lost it. My mind went blank. I panicked. How did you achieve these streaks, Miss? Did you do it during assemblage? Or afterwards? Miss! Your chocolates were excellent. You have a gift. You just need to refine it. Given the proper wings, you will fly. Thank you. Everything scares you, right? Talking to people, going to the store, living life. Right? You too? I hide it. It can be done. I have a tearoom and shop. Mercier Sweetshop. Mercier's my name. I want to do a new line of handmade chocolates. I'd like to hire you. The problem was, no one could know I was making them. It would've paralyzed me. To keep it a secret, Mr. Mercier told people I was just the delivery girl. He said the chocolate maker was a hermit who lived in seclusion in the mountains. Mercier chocolates became popular. People in the business wondered who this hermit was, and why he wanted to remain anonymous. It became a local legend. For seven years I lived that way. Making chocolates at home, unseen, unknown. Pure bliss. Then, one day... Mr. Mercier! Good evening, Miss. I've come to eat. You can do that here. Did a man reserve a table for two? His name? Oh, right. I don't know his name, sorry. Excuse me. A table for two. Thank you. Pardon me. I am a volcano. Hello. It's you, hello! Have a seat. It's silly, I don't know your name. So what is it? Jean-Rene Vandenhugde. Vanden... hugde. The G can be silent. Very nice. I read, on the paperwork, your name is Delange? - Your first name starts with A? - Angelique. Lovely name, Angelique. Yours is too, Jean-Pierre Vanden... gadooch. Hugde. And it's Jean-Rene. Of course. I'm sorry. Lovely name. - Really? - Yes, it's... Pardon me. Thank you. Excuse me. May I make a suggestion? Why not. Meat or fish? - Both. - You want two dishes? No, just one. What are you having? I'll have... the sea bream. Excellent idea. Good choice. To drink? I recommend white wine. Good idea. White wine sounds good. Yes, wonderful. A carafe? Perfect. I've been craving a carafe. So, what's your take on the Middle East? The Middle East... No clue. Do you follow the Champions League? Champions? Of what? Nothing. Excuse me, I'll be right back. International politics, no. Football, no. Art? Art. I'm burning up. Calm down. I'm burning up. Calm down. I love the English painters. England has painters? Why wouldn't they? Exactly. They must have painters there. What kind of car do you have? A French one, I think. - And you? - Me? What kind of car do you have? Excuse me for a minute. I'm hopeless. Shit! What's up? I don't know. The white wine! White wine is extraordinary. White wine is... White wine is... white wine. Excuse me. He'll be back, don'tworry. Being alone with a woman is torture. But you say you love them. I love them. I love them. But... What scares me... is intimacy. I'm afraid to let someone in. My father had the same problem. He was afraid. Afraid of what? He was afraid... of world politics, nuclear war, that kind of thing. Afraid of his customers, the tax inspector, disease, of course. But also medicine. What else? He was afraid of everything. He had a pet phrase. "Let's hope nothing happens to us." He said it all the time. Let's hope nothing happens to us. Excuse me! Please. I have some bad news. Miss Delange, our sales rep, has probably left us. Already? Chocolate is tricky. It's a difficult job. Though highly competent, she... Sorry, sorry! The subway was flooded, I took a bus. Any other woman would've hated me for leaving like that, would've quit the job. And called me a louse, with good reason. But... she came back to work, and that's... very impressive. Quite something. I'll give you another exercise. Do it! Pardon me. What must I do? Touch someone. Touch someone, how? In an ordinary way. Shake hands, for example. I never shake hands. Precisely. Miss Delange! It's me. About the other night... Yes? I'm sorry. I had to leave suddenly. I have a chronic illness. My esophagus. Really? Fibopractosis. Right, fibopractosis. I had to go straight to ER. When it flares up, I must treat it quick. I did it. I took her hand. Usually my palms are clammy. Strangely they were dry. Trouble was, once I had her hand, I didn't know how to let it go. Absurd, huh? An idea occurred to me. I'll act like I'm in love. I hoped she'd be offended by my kiss and that would be that. But... that didn't work. She's so in control of every situation. It's astounding. Fortunately, as I was kissing her, I imagined another way out. I'm sorry. For what? That kiss. Really? I rather liked it. Me too. But I'm your boss, you're my employee. You're right. At the same time, it's true... it was nice, that kiss. Indeed it was. Maybe we could do... one last one. What? One last kiss. Then go back to normal. What do you think? Ok. But this has to be the last one. If my employees knew we were... could've been together, it'd be disastrous. Disastrous... for team spirit. I understand. No one must know. Fine. Right! Off I go. Where? To work. To find new customers. New customers. Good luck. Hi, Mom. Angelique, my little mouse! How'd you get in? Last time you loaned me your keys. I made copies. You never know. This is... Frank. Frank. I met him this morning at a conference. Before leaving town, I thought it'd be nice to pop up and see my little Angelique. Happy? Very. See you tomorrow. No exercise? Excuse me? I usually get an exercise. Give something. To who? Anyone you like. Just give something. Excuse me. I have a gift for you. Are you feeling alright, sir? Well? Try this one. Sublime. Refined. Goes down easy. Flowery. Fruity. Taste how the flavors blend. Superb ganache. Generous. This chocolate gives. Slip it in your mouth, and boom! Your palate comes alive. High art. Creme de la creme. And it has such a beautiful sheen. What are you doing? Miss Delange! We're having a lunch break tasting session. It's only 10 a.m. Tasting what? Mercier chocolates. The last ones we'll ever taste. Really? Why? Mr. Mercier is dead. No one could find his chocolate maker. An old hermit who lived in the desert. - The mountains. - He's talented. Only Mercier knew how to locate him. He took the secret to his grave. Shame. Any manufacturer would be lucky to have him. Taste it. It's one of the best in the world. Much better than ours. How can you say that? The Chocolate Mill makes good chocolate. You're sweet. It's not great. You don't know chocolate. I know chocolate very well. You mustn't insult good chocolate. Chocolate deserves respect. Yours is good. Good, old-fashioned chocolate. I'll prove it, I'll sell it the world over! We'll have branches in New York, Tokyo and... Maubeuge! Maubeuge? Your chocolate is excellent, but it's... obsolete. That's the word. Obsolete. You haven't evolved with the times. Really? So, how many boxes? None. I'm trying to tell you. I managed to offload some to Romania, at a loss. The rest went to waste. You're our last regular customer. If you stop buying, we'll go bankrupt. I'm sorry. You haven't tried our new line. You have a new line? We're working on a whole new range of chocolates. The first batches have been promising. Really? We want to update and enrich our traditional offering. Bring the customers back to our brand. We thought of you first, to taste the new line. But if you're not interested... Could you bring me some samples? As soon as they're edible? A new line? We can't create a new line. It's that or bankruptcy. Creating a new line takes work and research. We can sketch out a plan. Ludo and Antoine are hardworking, nice guys. But they can't create new chocolates. We'll need someone else. But who? I thought of... Who? Who? So... If I say nothing, The Chocolate Mill goes bankrupt. But if I reveal I'm the hermit, I'll panic. I have an idea. Really? A webcam. - Mercier's chocolate maker. - How'd you find him? I promised him I wouldn't tell. He is indeed a hermit. But I've got him on the phone. Via this web camera, he can see everything we're doing. He can see us now? Yes. I mean... yes. Hello, sir. Honored to meet you. So am I. Can you see us? Where do we begin? Antoine, you mustn't whip it. Be gentle. Air bubbles make it sandy. According to him. Magda, use more pink peppercorns. Like this, sir? Perfect. Suzanne, getting the recipe? Are these thin enough? No, thinner still. Two millimeters at most. Magda, prepare the mold for the ganache. Pour it now. - I'm not done. - He says now! We mustn't let it cool down. Nice and tight, Magda. Make sure it's even. He says chocolate is nothing to be afraid of. Antoine, can you chop the fresh mint? This may be silly, but... Could we try mixing the fresh mint with cashews and dark chocolate? It's probably a stupid idea. I don't want to... Did you hear that, sir? He says there's no such thing as a stupid idea. Let's give it a try. Excuse me, sir! Chop the porcini very fine. A pinch on each tuile. So? Delicious. Antoine, heat the cream with the chopped mint. Can you see alright, sir? Great. Not too close to the edge. Because we're flattening them? Cellophane. Press firmly but not too hard. Otherwise they're too big. Right in the middle. Now we can taste them. Excuse me. I think it's her. What? She's the hermit! - Why would she go to all this trouble? - No idea. The white ganache with paprika is interesting. Needs a bit more paprika. Maybe. These porcini tuiles... are to die for. The green tea whites are surprising. Have a taste. They're excellent. So velvety. Slip it in your mouth and it titillates your tongue. Caresses it. So smooth. But not right away. It builds slowly. Then the flavors explode. One after the other. Like a bittersweet embrace. Silky. Sensual. Wait until tomorrow. The flavors will penetrate the chocolate. Really? Penetrate the chocolate? Impregnate it. Impregnate it? I think we have enough samples. Tomorrow I'll take them to our customer, Mrs. Legrand. Good. Thank you. Good night. See you tomorrow. Goodbye. So? I haven't tasted chocolate this good since Mercier. Will you order some? Chocolate like this deserves a proper launch! Where? The Roanne International Chocolate Convention? The ideal place for a launch. We'll compete for best chocolate maker. It's very high profile. I know. It's huge. Gutsy move. You believe in our chances? Then go ahead. Have fun in Roanne. You're coming too. Me? No. You must. Really? Well, they say travel is good for finding oneself. And I've never been to Roanne. Ok, great idea, fantastic. Roanne, here we come! That's the one. Lemon. Try this one. A classic. Delicious. The jury! Hello, Mrs. Legrand. Mercier's chocolate maker. I recognize his technique. Unique. Extraordinary. He should show himself. We'll try to lure him out of his lair. Right? Miss Delange knows him personally. Really? How lucky you are. You look familiar. Have we met? I don't think so. Are you sure? Strange, I never forget a face. Especially a pretty face. Good day! Good evening I mean. It's evening. Yes. Did you reserve? We're full. The chocolate convention. Chocolate is popular. We did reserve. Vandenhugde and Delange, please. Yes. Here you are. Have a pleasant night. Excuse me. The second key, please. What second key? Shall we go for a walk? Great idea! Shall we go back? You want to? Not necessarily. Let's keep going. Very well. Excuse me. Pardon me. A flower for your wife? She's not my wife, she's my coworker. Shame. A flower for your coworker, then? No thanks. I'll take one. Thank you very much. I'll take one too. Here you are, sir. Have a good night anyway. Here. Thank you. - It's nothing. - And for you. Me? Business flowers! Thank you. Would you like a third dessert? And you? Some fruit, maybe? I can't digest fruit at night. Thank you. You're welcome. They seem to be closing. Think so? Maybe we should go back up. Where? To the room. Right. The room. The room. Excuse me... What? The Russian song, Ochi Chyornye. I know it, watch. Ochi Chyornye! In your big dark eyes I have lost myself I am hypnotized My heart is paralyzed I love you so You scare me so Is this an evil spell? Or the evil hour? All around us Gypsies sing No one has a care They all sip champagne In your pretty dark eyes I am drowning, my love And though they sing I am down, my love I have lost all reason Longing for your arms I burn with passion Let me taste your charms In your big dark eyes There is a strange light They seem to hold The mysteries of the night It is you I desire I know I am wrong I am so sad For my love is so strong Your burning dark eyes Have captured me They have pulled me in O sweet agony I am crazy for you My dark-eyed beauty Though I know not What's in store for me My passion for you O Dark Eyes Inspired this song Ochi Chyornyel I'll sleep on the couch. There is no couch. That's odd. Be right back. I truly believe in me... Jean-Rene? Mr. Vanden... hugde? Hard times? Pardon me? Your wife threw you out? My wife? That's how it started for me. My divorce. I couldn't help noticing, the key and all. Noticing what? I can spot them a mile off. Spot what? Couples in trouble. In my job, you know, I see so many... conflicts. Breakups. Don't let her go. She's the love of your life. It shows. Really? Maybe not. But being alone is the worst. It's me! Are you ok? I'm fine. Am I too heavy? Not at all. Good. I think... I think I'm in love with you. Good. I mean, thank you very much. You're welcome. Me too. What? I feel... like you. The same. Thank you. You're welcome. Can I kiss you? Good idea. Seems appropriate. Know what, Mr. Vandenhugde? I mean Jean-Rene, now we're in love! We'll soon be engaged. Or we could just get married. I warn you, my mother is a handful. But we'll have to involve her. Don't worry, it'll be wonderful. I look nice in white. And we'll have kids. How many? Two, three? I'd like more, but they kill romance. I want our sex life to stay satisfying. It's important. Excuse me. Be right back. Be right back. I'm hopeless. Hopeless. Let's do it! Angelique? Oh well. Phew! What do you mean, "Phew"? You don't love her? I love her madly. I've never felt this way before. Then why "phew"? Fear. Fear of love and its problems. Relationship anxiety. There's a positive side. No. Anxiety wins. Mustn't do anything. Mustn't take risks. "Let's hope nothing happens to us." I'm sorry to inform you Miss Delange has left us. It was her own choice. We all liked her very much, but... Sorry. Yes, Madam. I'll get him for you. - It's for you. - Who is it? Mrs. Legrand. Excuse me. That's great news. We got 40 orders. The hermit won the top prize, best chocolate maker! It's fabulous. Where was I? Miss Delange is leaving us. - No. - What do you mean no? That's impossible. What Antoine means is, Miss Delange cannot leave us. Miss Delange is a great sales rep, but she... She's Mercier's chocolate maker. What? The hermit is Angelique. What are you talking about? The camera, the computer? All phony. - You mean? - She created the new line. With your help. My help? I just made two little... Listen up. You started a fling with that girl. You owe it to the company to continue. She's pretty as a picture. Indeed. You love her. You're in love. I am. If she goes, we're bankrupt. So we'll take you to her and you'll put things right. Take me to her? I don't know where she lives. I do. It's on her application. I hadn't thought of that. Very clever. Indeed. On the right. Just there. This is it Number 10. It was closer than I thought. So? What? - Are you going? - Where? Ring her bell, sir. What do you mean no? Excuse me, but... But what? No. I'm... What's wrong, for Pete's sake? I'm afraid. Afraid of what? Pretty much everything. So what should I do, sir? Let's wait a bit. I'll be alright in a minute. Right. There she is! - I'm not ready. - What do we do? I don't know. Follow her. Sorry sir, but afraid or not, you must go. Or stay. It's up to you. You're right, Magda. Absolutely right. Are you ok, sir? All is well! Are you sure? Not to worry! Emotions Anonymous meetings I did it. For the first time, I said no. To a man who'd been courting me. He wanted to marry me, have kids, love me forever. But I said no. And I stuck to it. No means no. Although... maybe... I should've said yes. Because... I did like him. He was sweet. Thank you. Thank you, Adele. Hi, I'm Maxim, emotional. Hi, Maxim. Hardly anyone knows I'm emotional. I don't discuss it. I hide it as best I can. People often think the opposite. They find me self-assured, even smug or harsh. So they're tough on me. They cut me no slack. They're confrontational. It hurts. I hide the pain, making me seem even more harsh. It's a vicious circle. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you, Maxim. My name is Jean-Rene. I'm emotional, I guess. In any case, I'm shy. When I'm in love, it's like I'm burning up, you know? I imagine you do. I'd do anything to face my emotions, like this man. Maxim, right? Like you, I hide them. But there's this woman I love. She's so talented. She's emotional, like me. Like all of us. She's the love of my life, I know that now. I'd like to ask her... to spend some time with me. Maybe even the whole time! We'll make chocolate together forever. If she loves me. Because she's pretty as a picture. That's all. Thank you, Jean-Claude. Jean-Rene. Hi, I'm Angelique, emotional. Yes, hello. I'm sorry, but it won't work. I love you and I know you love me. But it's a recipe for disaster. We'll get to know each other, warts and all. We'll annoy each other, stop communicating and end up hating each other. I don't want that. We're both emotional. It's a recipe for disaster. We're not strong enough. We understand each other, only too well. We'll pull each other down, like two people drowning. Our struggling will only make us sink faster. I don't want to sink. Or drown, even with you. So... we should stop now. I hadn't looked at it that way. Thank you, Angelique. I can't stay. Excuse me. I can't let you ruin your life the way I did. You love that man. You love him, clearly! Plunge, Angelique. What? I... Yes? Sorry. Why? Are you ok? Not really. Dizzy? I feel hot. Me too. Are they watching us? No, no one... If you need a doctor, I'm here. You ok, boss? Yes! Why wouldn't I be? I read in a magazine that life's three most stressful situations are moving, exams and weddings. But if you feel fine... I feel fine. Thank you, Antoine. See you at the church. See you there. Sir? Where are you? Yes. My hands are clammy. I don't mind. My stomach's growling. I like the sound. I blush all the time. I think that's beautiful. Shall we?
