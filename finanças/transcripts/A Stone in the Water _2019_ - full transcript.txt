♪ Thou hast told me to say ♪ ♪ It is my soul me to sing ♪ ♪ It is well, ever rose ♪ Miss Comstock, the boy. We need to stop Jake. You've been saying that a while now. I mean it. You're all the same. I mean it Jake, we're done. You mean until next time? No done, like we never started. But we did, and we wouldn't want a certain somebody to find out about it. How would that happen? I don't know. Loose lips. That's headed this way. It's headed to my place. Don't, please baby, die. No, let me do it. Tommy, Tommy, come on baby talk to me. Talk to me. Okay, okay, we got it. Tommy, come on baby, talk to me. How'd he get in the pond? I thought you were watching him? No, I was in the fields. You were supposed to come get him. Tommy. Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, talk to me, baby. Tommy? Come on. Tommy, baby. Please, don't. It has nothing to do with you, Grace. Please Martha, you promised. He did this, right? I forgive you, Grace. But I can't forgive him. I know about you and grace. She told me everything. Everything, huh? Enough. She tell you what it's like to be married to a church mouse with a shoe-leather pussy? When Tommy was drowning, you were screwing my best friend when you should've been here with him. Our son may never even learn to read. What do you want me to do about that? You put it on me, you sick son of a bitch. You got a retarded child, go tend to him. May God have mercy on you, Jake. If God had any mercy, he would have left that boy in the water. What the fuck? I feel sick. Where are we going? Brother's, a couple hours from here. The ex con? He's got a place we can stay. Loser. What'd you say? Another loser. You two have something in common. You were lucky. I hear your horn. Drive too fast. Tom. Alex. Thank you. There was a man driving, you didn't see him? Maybe he fall in the river. Jesus. I need to go look for him. Can't go out now. Storm is bad. You rest now, okay? We'll look for him tomorrow. Yeah, okay. Ok... Hey, where are you going? My mom friend house. Don't you have a car? Stay here, I come back soon. I'm Alex, thank you so much for coming. Are you okay? Yeah, but my friend was with me and I need to find him. I'm grace, get in the car, we'll go. Jesus, you carried me all this way? I walk through the woods, it's not so far. Well, it looks like you're going have to take the bus home. I think your friend gone. I'm sorry. It's chilly, let's go to my house for coffee. His mom is visiting her sister, but she'll be back tonight. The service in this house is really bad. You'd have better luck with the landline. Hi, this is Vi, I can't talk right now, bye. I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but I should go. Well, what about your friend? He lucked out. He called someone and they came and got him. Are you all right? Yeah, yeah. You said there's a bus station? Oh yeah, in town. We'll get your stuff. It's a good thing, Tommy was out there. I didn't hear a thing. What's wrong with him? Fell in pond when he was little, almost died. But he does just fine. He looks after both our places. What about his father? Oh, he took off ages ago. Stupid piece of shit. Who takes care of him? His mom and me. We've been friends forever, through the best and the worst of it. Is there anything I can do to thank him? Oh, don't make a fuss. We keep to ourselves. If you want to catch that bus we got to go. So how long have you been working behind the bar? Doing this? Uh, wow, Since I was like five. Yeah, I took a class in Montessori. Hey, what's up? Where's Alex? She didn't show up. She didn't even call. I think that she had this thing that came up with her boyfriend. Bree, please don't fire her, please. Not until we figure out what happened? What happened? Have you seen Frank? No. Where's your car. Wrecked. Okay, let me take you home. No. I can't. You see this? What's this? He was a fence, shop was a front. I know this guy, Frank used to sell him all of his gambling take. Yeah, a lot of stuff that was hot too. They were partners for awhile. But lately it wasn't going to well. That ones worth at least three K. Maybe if it wasn't hot, best I can do is 900. Last week Frank heard a rumor that he took in a big haul of diamonds and gold, some inside job in L.A. So Tuesday Frank arranged for me to stop by his place after he closed. Jason? You there? Around back, come to the gate. Hey. Something wrong? No, it's, I've never been down here before. It's just a place, for special people. Um... Frank wanted you to hold on to these. He's off playing pool somewhere and he didn't want them around the house. So where'd they come from? I don't know. I never know. Is that all you got for me? Well, actually Frank said you could show me some nice jewelry. My birthday's coming up. Okay, kiddo. You got any diamonds? Sure. They're a bit out of Frank's range. It couldn't hurt to look could it? I mean, we could do a deal. Sure. What the hell are you doing? Hey got off! Let go! Stop, let go! Nice work honey. You shot him. Yeah I did. He never open the safe for me. He's dead Frank. Yeah, but look what he left us. You didn't say you were gonna kill him. Didn't say I wasn't. And then we crashed. And this guy came out of nowhere and saved my worthless ass. But Frank was gone. Best case scenario, somewhere in the river. And what about the jewelry? Stashed. I didn't want to get caught with it. I didn't know what happened to Frank, but what if the cops had him? Vi, we murdered a guy. No you didn't. I set him up. No, it doesn't matter who did what. You need to get out of town. Okay, you're the only witness to this thing and if Frank is alive. I know. After the robbery he was ice. I think the plan was to take me out to the woods and get rid of me. Well, hopefully you'll never find out. I'll lay low for a few days. If Frank doesn't show I'll get the stash and run. Mexico, Argentina, Chile... as far as I can. Hey, you're safe here. Okay? Give me your phone. I'm going to get you a new phone and a new number and you don't go anywhere unless you absolutely have to. Oh shit. See you survived the storm. Tom is a real hero, and that is the truth of the pudding. Well, I'm not even a little bit surprised. He's made of strong stuff. What was she like, the girl? Nice, a little on the nervous side. The accident really shook her up. She was pretty? She couldn't say enough good things about Tom. Well hardly anybody meets our boy doesn't fall in love with him. Well you had quite the adventure. I go for a walk in the rain. You like the rain. So, uh... then you found this girl? I bring her home, she have to sleep here. How'd you get the blouse? She leave it, cause it ripped. You're my special boy. You've always been my special boy. I love you so much. How much do I love you? Big as the sky. As big as the sky. And the moon, and all the stars. Okay, to bed, to bed. Our father who art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread and forgive us, our trespasses. As we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us, not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For ours... If there's anything I can do. Sam, leave me be. Reverend, reverend. Tell me this. How could God do this? He was such a good boy. He was only good, he never hurt anyone, he never even had an unkind thought. As much as we try, we can never truly understand how God works. Oh, understand? What's to understand? This is just cruel, this is an act of cruelty, God's laughing at me, and you, and you... and all of you! Tom? Tom? Tom? You home? Tom? Who are you? What are you doing in my house? I just came to see Tom. Tommy's dead. What are you doing here? I'm sorry. There's, there's someone down there. Martha, Tom's mom. I didn't mean to intrude, I'm really sorry. Don't worry, you just go sit down and I'll see to Martha. So sad, they just buried him on Wednesday. I had no idea. If it's okay, I'd love to meet her. I'm happy to get a room, come back tomorrow. You better hold off on that. Martha needs some time alone. I understand. I'll just be on my way. Who was that girl? That's the girl from the accident. What's she doing here? Where are you going? Why? Why him? Why not me, I'm the sinner. He never hurt a soul. Old witch scared the shit out of me. And then I couldn't get past her friend. Well the good news is that nobody's seen Frank. I'll wait a week. Go back out, take care of business and then, outta here. You okay? Yeah, just beat. My stomach's queasy. I've been looking for yoU, but I can't find you. Where'd you go? Hey, you're up early. I went to the women's clinic. One of Frank's sperm got lucky. Shit. Two miscarriages, a handful of specialists, and three guys I kicked to the curb who actually would have made decent fathers. Then after they told me my uterus is basically a toxic waste dump. Fucking Frank, the only real sociopath in the pack somehow knocks me up. Okay. Well, next time you'll... They're saying there isn't going to be a next time. And it's only 50, 50 I'll carry to term, even if I do everything, right. Like what? Stay off my feet the first trimester, avoid any kind of stress. I've been through it before, it sucks. Hey, do you want to do this? Then I will be there every step of the way, whatever you need. I'll make it up to you, I swear. We'll get that stash and we'll be done with the bars for good. We can go live in South America, I've got family there, and I'll pay my kid's way through Princeton. I know you will. I need you to help me find a new place, somewhere Frank won't find me. I can't drive, you have to take me to the clinic every week or so. And shop, and keep a look out. No sign of Frank anywhere. You checked the apartment? Yeah, mail's piling up. You can relax, he's gone. Can't, not until I'm sure that prick is dead. Martha, Martha! I've been working in the County fair. I should've never let her get that way. Can you get in? Yup. Martha, Martha! Martha? You up there? Martha? Hold it doc, that's her personal space. Let me check it out. My God, what are you doing? I was just thinking about... all the good times we had. You and me, Tommy. God. Oh that bastard Jake. That son of a bitch. We agreed we'd never talk about him again. What difference does it make? It was so long ago. Doctor Sam is upstairs and he wants to see you, not another word about that. No more about that. You're going to be fine. I want you to come see me at my office in a couple of weeks. This will help her with the depression. Will you make sure she takes it? You can count on it. Someone should look after her. No worries about that either. Come on M, take your pill. I keep asking why? Never get an answer. How ya doing hun? I'm okay. Just don't feel like talking, that's all. Well you take your time. I'm here when you do. Okay Gracie, see if she wants to start up. Okay! That's a connection. You are doing so much better. Yeah but you know, the hurt's still wearing on me. Time hun, time. ...attack on Pearl Harbor. Who's there? Why didn't you answer me? I can't hear you over the TV. How are you feeling? Dizzy, weak. I talked to the doctor, he says I have to stay put another month or so. But besides that you're doing okay? Except that I keep saying Frank walking through that door. You're still worried about him? No, not that much. Now it's mostly about this. I keep thinking even if the baby survives the swamp down there I'll manage to mess it up. No you won't. What are you going to do about this old woman and the jewelry? What if she finds your stuff, what if she figures out that you're the one that put it there? She won't, I doubt she even remembers me, but I have to reconnect with her. You're okay. You both are. Dear Mrs. Comstock, I hope this note finds you well. I think of your son often and would appreciate the chance to see you and talk about him. Fondly, Alex Parker. Oh Grace. You're not going to believe this, wait till you see. This just came in the mail. Oh, isn't that nice. Do you remember her coming by to see you? I do. Look at this. Oh, she's going to have a baby. Do you know she sent Tom a wrist watch with his name on it? No, I had no idea. Grace. Think back to when she spent the night here, she and Tommy were here alone together all night long. I'm not pretending to know exactly what happened or what's on her mind now, but she says she wants to see me. Her return address is a post office box. Did she leave a phone number? I know what you're thinking and you are probably wrong. You know nothing about this girl. I have to see her. Have to talk to her. There's an old saying my mother once told me. If a stone falls in the water, a thousand wise men, can't bring it back. Think about it. Maybe you're looking for peace of mind in the wrong place. What's done is done. There's no changing it now. My comfort is in thinking that maybe it was all meant to be. I wish I knew what I was supposed to do. Alex, thank you so much for the kind words and lovely photo. Please accept my apology for the way I behaved the day you came to see me. Was a very bad time, but I'm much better now. And if you have it in your heart to forgive my rudeness, it would be my great pleasure for you to come visit any time it suits. I would so enjoy talking to you, all my best, Martha Comstock. There's our invitation. Okay, I've got one more battery of tests and then they say, I'll be okay to travel. Let me help you with that Vi. Frank. More Frankenstein than Frank. You've been gone for the last few months. Better part of a year. By the way, my honey around? I can't seem to find her. She left town a couple months after you disappeared. Took a job in Eugene I think. I figured something like that. I get it. She needed to do her own thing. Hey, if you're busy, we can talk some other time. No, no that's okay, I have some time before my shift. Come in. Do you still take your coffee, black? I'm off of caffeine. Got any herbal tea? Yeah. Yeah. Sugar, alcohol, dope. Done with it. Accident put me through some changes. Yeah, I can see that. Disappeared for awhile. I was on a road trip to see a friend out East. Driving too fast as usual and no seatbelt. I wrecked bad. So bad I blacked out. Somehow I got tossed into a river. When I woke up the car was gone and I was, no sense of mincing words, totally fucked up. Lucky thing the kids who found me had phones, mine was gone. Called my brother. Told him what happened and where I was. You look bad, Frank. No shit. I had no idea. You need a hospital, bro. No hospitals, just give me a shot. Don't blame me if you don't wake up. Shut up and shoot me. Brother called Alex, but she didn't pick up. I'm sure she was pissed at me. She was always pissed at me. Before his first prison term, brother was taking a night course in nursing. I thought he could take care of me, which might've been a mistake. I was busted in more places than I can name. Also, my right eye was toast. For a while there, it was touch and go. Do you have to blow smoke in my face? But after I pulled back from the abyss, I started thinking, reflecting on my past deeds in a way I never did before. I had plenty of time for that. It was close to four months before I could stand on my own two feet. I called Alex before her number went bye bye. That was food for thought. Over time, a lot of time, the old Frank, the hustler with a 10 ton chip on his shoulder, faded away. And gradually a new Frank, a lot more patient and tolerant, took his place. We would agree that the old Frank needed an overhaul wouldn't we? Well, that Frank is history. I should go. I just wish Alex was here so I could apologize for the way I mistreated her. I guess you don't have a number or an address? No, no, I haven't talked to her since she left town. I'm sure she'll pop up one of these days. Maybe it's all for the better. Oh, would it be okay for me to use your phone? I left mine where I'm staying. Yeah, sure. Come on. Look at that. Looks like you sent the text just about the time I showed up. Interesting. If I called this number do you think I would get a mutual acquaintance? It's just a guy I'm seeing. I'm sorry Vi. That wasn't nice. New Frank don't grab other people's phones, that's ignorant. But the truth is, once in a while, if new Frank gets bent out of shape, that means bad temper shit, and old Frank can suddenly reappear. Out of nowhere. And if old Frank gets into a foul mood, there's really nothing new Frank can do to calm him down. Now let's talk about our mutual acquaintance. And let's try not to make old Frank mad. He left. Where's he been all this time? Recovering from the accident. He wanted to know where you were and I said that you left town and that I didn't have an address. I can't talk right now. Meet me at hip hop class. Sure. Fuck. Hi, this is Vi, I can't talk right now, bye. Mrs. Comstock? I'm sorry to show up without calling. I didn't have your number. Look, if you're busy, I'll just say hello and be on my way. I wouldn't dream of it. You just come right on in. So what brings you down this way? Oh, it's on my way to visit a friend from school and I took a little detour because I wanted to talk to you. Well I'm just tickled that you thought of me, especially with the baby coming so soon. I'm not due for another month or so. But you're good to travel? Yeah, short road trips. I'll be back in Portland by Monday. I think maybe we need some refreshments. Why don't I make some ice tea? Oh, please, don't go to any trouble. It's no trouble at all, please make yourself comfortable. Okay. I'll be right back. All right. Oh God, oh God. Oh God, oh God. Oh God, oh God. Okay. Okay. Do you take sugar? No, cut down on that. Doctor's orders. And then after all those years of us just living our lives, he was gone. It was like the angel of death just swooped down, for what reason, maybe God knows, I don't. I'm so sorry for your loss. Tom was very kind to me. You married? I'm sorry, that was rude. No it's okay. No, I'm not married. I'm sure you have plans, but would you consider staying for dinner? I don't get many visitors, especially young people. That's very sweet of you. No really, I'd appreciate the company. Yeah, sure, why not? My friends not expecting me till tomorrow. Do you have far to go? Yes, but I'm staying in a motel tonight. Well then we can talk in the kitchen. Great. I can't remember the last time I had a home cooked meal like this, everything was delicious. Most of it, straight from the garden. Do you good to get a little bit more of that in your diet for the baby, you know. Yeah, you think so? Yes, ma'am. I mean... things you city folk eat. Raw fish wrapped in seaweed? Snails? Grubs we call them. I feel like if I didn't see it on TV, I wouldn't believe it. Why don't we retire to the living room? Are your feet cramping up? Its okay, you don't have to. You're tense, from your ankles to your toes. Thanks. City life does that. Portland, right? Yeah, last few years. Detroit, before that I was born in st. Louis. Well I lived my whole life right here in Hadley, among the Druids Druids? Yes ma'am, hill people, backward and ornery shit. Shoot as soon as look at ya. Marry their own cousins, some of them. You city folk, you think we're all just inbred morons, don't you? You got me there. Between work and the baby, I've been on edge. Well, I understand completely. May I feel the baby? Do you believe in an almighty God? Why do you ask? Well, recently I've been stuck on the subject. Just want to know your opinion on it. I don't really get along with religion. Did you ever? When I was a a kid, maybe. Well kids believe what you tell them, pretty much. Yeah, till they learn better. Well once life makes a couple of wrong turns it takes an iron will to keep believing. Do you agree with that? I talk to blunt. It's always been my problem. No, it's all good. What's the baby's daddy like? There I go again, the question just popped into my head. Gone, I should have known right away that it wasn't going to work out, but I didn't. I figured as much. Tommy's daddy, we never got along. But I got Tommy out of it, so. Sad to say, I could never give him a brother or sister, my baby maker just wasn't up to it. Oh. Dozed off, I'm so embarrassed. No wonder, you had a long day. Yeah. Left right after work. Probably should've gotten a good night's sleep first. Why don't you stay over? Get a fresh start in the morning. I don't want to impose. Oh, it's no trouble. I'll make up the guest room, take a minute. Actually, do you mind if I sleep on the couch? That way I could leave early without disturbing you. Sure you'll be comfortable there? Absolutely, if I hadn't heard you come in, I'd probably still be asleep. Okay, I'll get you a pillow. Thank you. Hi, this is Vi. I can't talk right now, bye. Is everything okay? Yeah, just a problem at work. I'll deal with it in the morning. I made you some tea. Oh, thank you. It's chamomile. Oh that's so kind of you, thank you. It'll put you right to sleep. Okay then. Listen, if you hear me rattling around the house in the middle of the night, don't pay any attention I'm a light sleeper. Okay. Rise and shine. It's a muscle relaxant, I used to give it to Tommy when he seized up, it'll wear off. What? My daddy was constable. He dealt with all sorts of criminals. What sort of criminal are you? I'm not. Well you came here to hide. People are after you. You thought you'd be safe here. What? No. It doesn't matter now, all that matters is you're here and here you'll be safe so. Potty break time. Are you fucking kidding me? You insane? Let me out of these. No, no, and no. There you go sweetie. I got a chill the first time I heard about you. Call it an omen. But then Tommy was gone so fast, nothing else, mattered. Then your picture arrived and I realized God works in strange. Come on, eat your breakfast. I'm not hungry. Maybe your baby's hungry, did you ever think about that? Explain something to me. With all the men out there in the world, why would you take up with a simple country boy? The baby's father is a thief. We lived together for a while, but I left him. He thinks I took stuff, stuff he stole. So he's holding my best friend hostage. Well, I don't know about that. I know two things. You're in trouble. And you were delivered to me so I could protect Tommy's baby and that's exactly what I'm gonna do. Lady, it's not his goddamn kid. You can curse all you want. It's not going to change my mind. Your drugs are okay, but the food is shit. You gonna shoot me? Kill the baby? Well, you can still have a baby with a foot full of buckshot, just hurt a lot more. You're insane. Maybe. But I got the gun. Get on the bed. Put those around your ankles. Put those around your ankles, what are you suddenly hard of hearing? Fuck you. My daddy told me never to point a loaded gun unless I intended to use it. I never touched your son. You know, all this is happening for a reason. I don't expect you to believe it because you don't believe in anything but yourself. Not even a miracle, not even when it's happening right inside you. I'm going to the market, get you some nourishment. You may need this. What a thoughtful host. Well I'm so glad you're here. You've been busy. I keep getting messages, please let me see them. He has my friend Is this for real? Jesus. What? Does he know where I live? I don't know. Did this girl give him my address? No, she wouldn't do that. Look, we have to get out of here. If Frank finds us, he'll slit our throats. Oh yeah? Well forewarned is fore-armed. You think you can handle Frank? Well, I refuse to believe you were sent here to be slice up by some murdering low life. Okay. Okay, truth. I stole from him diamonds, and jewelry and I hid it. If you let me go, I'll split it with you and you can buy yourself a castle. So first you say you didn't take his stuff, and now you say you did. You know what, I don't care whether you did or you didn't. I don't want any part of whatever it is you stole. We have to get out of here. We have to have dinner. He's going to cut us up and flush us down the toilet. We'll see about that. You gonna answer that? It's Grace. Talk to her later. You really believe all this is fated. I believe there is a plan and that each one of us has a part in it. And your son, was he meant to die so young? Can't say. Then how do you know what you're doing is right? The same way I knew I was right when they pulled Tommy out of the pond. They thought he was gone and I refused to accept it. Just because we don't understand a master plan doesn't mean there isn't one. Did you drug me again? Half dosage. You need a bath. You're making a big mistake. Yeah well, we both made mistakes. Not much I can do about mine at this point, but I'm doing the best I can to fix yours. Well, you know, at your age, it's hard to say, but you don't get that many chances to make life work out. From what I can tell you've used up most of yours. I thought God made everything right. No, we're free to mess up. I know that from personal experience, I took a wrong turn. It's funny though, I can't say I regret it. Didn't you hear me calling? Is everything all right? I was in the basement. Well, I just wanted to let you know there was some guy at the end of your driveway. You recognize them? No. He was probably lost or something. Well, if I see him again, I'll let you know. Thanks. Are you still taking your medication? Of course, doctor's orders. Look, I'm in the middle of cleaning, how about I stop by tomorrow? You, weren't paying attention, there's a backstairs off the kitchen. I think the baby. No, I don't think it's your time yet, but we'll see. I think I saw the same car on your driveway. Please, I'm not gonna. No, you're not. Give me a minute. Can I help you? Good afternoon, Ma'am is this the home of Tom Comstock? Tom's my son. He's been dead for some time now. Sorry to hear that. I was looking forward to meeting him. I guess that's not possible. Well, what can I do for you? Did you or your son know this woman? She's my sister, she disappeared several days ago. Family's frantic, a friend of hers gave us Tom's name, said he knew her and that she might've gone to see him, but we didn't have a number. Is that you there? Yeah, that was a long time ago. Not much of a family resemblance, don't mind my saying. She's my half sister. Okay, well she did come by a while back. She was looking for Tom. And then? She needed a place to stay for a couple of days while their apartment was getting fixed up. Tell you what, I think she's in some kind of trouble. Yeah, she's got problems. Do you know where she went? She's still here. She's upstairs. Sleeping, said she didn't want to see anybody but seeing as your family. Tommy attracted lots of young women. They came around looking for him. No kidding. Like stray cats in heat. He couldn't get rid of them. Ones that wouldn't leave, I had to lock up. Your girl here, you're welcome to take her. No, ma'am I'm afraid she's not. Well now we got a situation. Your pal was just here. I think I drove him off, but I'm not sure. Got here as fast as I could. Got a little job here. Let's do it. She's in the house with some old lady. Should be easy, but we might to get ugly. Whatever it takes, bro. Do you really have to smoke? It's fucking bad for you, man. Oh, fucking great, burn down the woods. Got your toys? Looks like bed time. See about a back door. Mrs. Comstock? Mrs. Comstock? You can gut the old lady, but we need Alex alive. Wait here. What? Frank, you okay? Frank. Frank? Martha? Martha? Did I hear a gunshot? Oh Grace, I got a situation. There's a woman upstairs, she's gonna have a baby. She's that girl from the accident, she's having Tommy's baby. She showed up here out of the blue with some story about how she wanted to visit with me and talk about Tommy. But she came here to hide, there are people after her. So she's going to have Tom's baby? Yes, please, don't judge. Jesus. Her water broke. I had no choice. It was the only way to protect the baby. It all happened so fast, you don't understand what went on here. Two guys came here. They were going to kill her. What? Yeah, they're in the basement. They're dead. I killed them. We got to uncuff her. Get some towels. Please, you have to help me, she's out of her mind. It's not Tom's kid, I swear. I believe you. I have to get out of here. Of course you will, but first you're gonna have that baby. Let her legs free for God's sake. Okay. Try to breath, try to breath. Oh God, it hurts. Breath, breath. Okay, okay. Come on, come on, you can do it. You're gonna do it, come on. Okay, hang on. You got this. You got this, its coming. Push harder! Come on, you can do it, you're doing it.
