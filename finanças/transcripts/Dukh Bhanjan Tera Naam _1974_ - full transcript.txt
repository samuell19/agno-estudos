You'll get the good news very soon. Divan, open up my treasuries. Distribute to all the people. No one should leave this place empty handed. Tell them to pray in the temples. Pray in the mosques.

You don't get the goods back. Wonderful. Wait, dear. If you still want a son then get more.. ...offerings on the no moon night to me. I don't know when I'll be in which world. Divan, I shouldn't hear any conches or prayer calls. If there was a God, Almighty then.. ...so many prayers wouldn't have gone unanswered. Don't get upset, sire. Divan, first I thought this kingdom, wealth and property.. ...a|| is given to me by God, but no. A God who can't give me a son.. ...how can he give me other things? Divan. - Yes, sire? Tell everyone to shut all temple and mosques. Sire. - Follow my orders, divan. This is unjust. It's a sin. Something untoward! All the temples cannot be closed down. Sire has humiliated our religion by releasing such orders. Come brothers, let's meet the archpriest. He'll surely make our plea be heard to Your Highness. Come. - Come. Come. This is unjust. Mosque is a house of God. It's unjust to close down all the mosques. It is being torturous. Come brothers, we'll request to the archpriest. Come with me. - Come! Come! Why are you so upset, My Lord? Neither I nor this innocent child is at fault for this. Scholars call daughters the wealth of the house. Must be. But she has brought disappointment for me. Don't lose hope. Who knows God might" _ God! There is no God, dear! There is no Almighty! There is no Almighty! - Oh God, what's wrong with him? Nothing is wrong with me, dear. I was in an illusion and I'm out of it.

I was expecting a son. - Yes. I got this daughter. What else should I be if not restless! A daughter? This girl is very fortunate. This girl from your family will enlighten the world. Enlighten the world! My palace is full of darkness. You're mistaken. King, look from your heart. You're so upset because you don't have a son? There are so many in the world.. ...who don't have a son or a daughter. Still they happily lead their life.. "Without a child under his guidance. I don't know anything. My penance, my perseverance. All has gone waste. I've lost faith in God, guru. King, this is the lack of your complete faith. What are you? What penance have you done? What so good that you have done.. "That God will fulfil all you wishes? You want a son to carry forward your family linage. It's possible that for He thinks.. "That a son might not be good for you. He didn't give you a son for your own good. King, always remember. Only what he wants shall happen. No, guru! From now only what I want will happen. King, the One who gave you this kingdom.. ...the same Almighty will also bless you with a son. But only when He thinks it's the right time. When will He know it's the right time? He didn't give me this kingdom. I made it on my own. With my power and strength. One tends to stop thinking before his doom. Arch priest. You might yourself burn with the fire you ignite. Archpriest, I don't want to hear anything else. You'll have to hear me today. You can't take away people's right with your powers. You can't be unjust being a King. To whom was I unjust? - With you subjects. You closed down the temples, isn't that unjust? You closed down the mosques, isn't that unjust? You might not need God, but those poor people need Him. And you shut Him down for them? Archpriest, I don't want anyone in my kingdom.. ...to take the name of this lie, which has no existence. I don't want to hear couches in my palace. And I get to here the pray call from the mosque. No noise reaches the palace anyway, King. What do you want to say? - Something you don't wish to hear. You still have time, hear out the truth. Or else King, you and your kingdom with go to hell. Archpriest! - You and your kingdom with go to hell. You and your kingdom with go to hell. Oh God, what's happening! A son or a daughter, it's a part of me. Lord Krishna, you've blessed me with a child. And you'll help me bring her up. It has been five years since Rajni's birth, God. But he is still upset about it. Help him calm down, God. What is this, mother? - Flower embroidered cloth. My mother gave it to me on my wedding. It's so beautiful. - Do you like it? I'll give it to you on your wedding. Nothing in the world can come in comparison to liquor. What do you say, divan? - Yes, sire. Nothing else matters. - Okay, now tell me who am I! You're our nurturer. - You're our King. Just the King? Call me the Emperor. The Emperor. Is there anyone around here to mess with me? No one, sire. To hell with everyone else. What did you say, divan? I said who would wish to die by messing up with you? Divan. - Yes? From tomorrow increase the tax. - I'll get it right now, sire. The rein, sire. The rein. - Think sensibility. I'm asking you to increase the taxes. - I got it, sire. I got it. - Ramlal. Start taxing the merchants too. Increase the taxes and fill the treasury. I'll fill them till the brim, sire. - Ramlal! Look at my face. Can you the eternal glow in me? Glow? Oven can be seen. - Divan! Sorry sire, bright eternal glow can be seen. You're our God. Our God. - I'm God. I'm God! Take the name of Lord Ram like.. ...you take each breath of yours. Mother, archpriest was reciting this. I asked him and he told me it's a very long story. Do you know it, mother? - Yes. Listen. There was a very powerful king named Harnaksh. He pleased the God and got a boon. That he can't die during the day or night. Neither can he die inside, nor outside. Neither from a human, nor from an animal. Then? - Taking the boon from God.. ...he himself became God. That King had a son, Prahlad. Prahlad refused accept his father as God. Then? - Angry father ordered his son.. ...to embrace a hot pillar. And there was a voice from Prahlad's heart. Embrace the hot pillar. Ram will embrace you. Then? - Prahlad embraced the pillar. But he was caused no harm. In angry, the King took out this sword. And the pillar came apart. - I too will become Prahlad, mother. I'll recite God's name. - Queen! My child is being taught the wrong thing in my palace. If say such a thing again I'll give you such a punishment.. "That people will even forget Heranyakashyap. Got it? Whatever pleases You is the only good done. You, eternal and formless one! Formless one! O my mind.. Remain always with the Lord. O my mind.. remain always with the Lord. This family which you see shall not go along with you. O my mind.. remain always with the Lord.

Give me something to eat, mister. I have nothing to offer you, brother. Oh yes, I've two chapattis to eat. You can have one of them. Here. Thank God. I haven't eaten a morsel from so many days. Why? It's such a big city, and you didn't get alms? From the time King Duni Chand.. ...has shut down this temple, no one comes here. Shut down the temple? Why so? Because he had the 7th daughter. He doesn't have a son. What is the fault of the temple in that? This is what I think. You were singing the 'Bishanpada' right? 'Bishanpada'? Oh fool, those are the holy words.. ...of Guru Nanak Dev recited by Guru Amar Das. It was very sweet. But don't recite it again. Or you'll be thrown into the dungeon. Into the dungeon? The one has his heart enlightened with Lord's name. For him even a dungeon is like a heaven, brother. Everyone is subject to His command.. ...no one is beyond His command. Nanak, one who understands His command. Does not speak in ego. I want to know! How did this person dare to.. ...sing the praises of God in my kingdom. This lunatic is from other village, sire. He's not from our kingdom. From wherever he might be. I ask.. why wasn't he stopped? Where were our soldiers? We send the soldiers as soon as we got to know of it, sire. Sire. Sire, the culprit is here. Ill-mannered! Divan, he doesn't know.. ...how to present himself in our court. Mister, you're in King Duni Chand's court. Bow down and greet him. I bow in front of my God or my Guru. Don't you know that I'm the God and the Guru here? What's the difference between here and there, King? There is only one God. Just one. The one which resides in all human beings. And resides everywhere. - Resides everywhere! Can you show me your God? God can never be shown, King. You've see him with your inner eyes. And the one who cannot see God from his inner eyes.. ...he is blind. - Ill-mannered! How dare you to call me blind in my court! I'm having pity on you as you're an outsider. Or else I would have taught you a lesson. I can be taught a lesson but the light in.. ...my heart can't be extinguished. Your name is a column. What is a column, guru? It is a wooden piece which supports the platform. What's a platform? - The one which is used by launderer. Devotee Naam Dev was a launderer by caste. While washing the clothes he used.. ...to wash his soul with the name of the Lord.

My orders are followed and not the scriptures in my kingdom. Priest, kindly begin. Priest, stop! This sin cannot be committed as long as I am here. Duni Chand, I represent your sad subjects. One call of mine and a thousand more voices will rise. All voices raised will be suppressed! Divan. - Yes? Call Rajni. - There she is, sire. Egoistic, sinner, cruel, King! God will never forgive you for this sin. He'll never forgive you! - What is my father's fault in it? One's destiny is written before birth. Whether he is a crippled or a beggar. He is my husband now. My deity. Heard that, Duni Chand? You want to torture this kind daughter of yours? Don't be sad, guru. And bless me that I can follow my father's orders. Lord Ram went to exile for 14 years on his father's orders. And Sita endured so much trouble with him. Can't I follow my father's orders? I've just one request. Give me the strength to serve my husband. I can fulfil my duties as his wife, God. God! God! God! She is still thinking about God! She won't be given a cloth or piece of jewellery as gifts! When you'll beg with your beggar husband.. ...you will know how powerful is God. Sheela, take out her earrings! - No! My daughter won't leave without her earrings. Divan. - Yes? Get this jewellery deposited in the treasury. Okay, sire. - Shame on you, Duni Chand. The treasury you keep this jewellery in will go empty. And the royalties which you're.. ...so proud of will cease to exist. You'll wander places and you'll beg door to door. This is my curse to you! Dear.. may God always keep you happy. Always keep you happy. Divan.. priest, what are you looking at? Begin the wedding rituals. Make the bride sit. In the pride of his wealth, the King.. ...has forgotten his duty towards the world. He wanted to be God but he couldn't a father to his daughter. O' father" What untoward have you done! O' father.. what untoward have you done! Being a king you made your daughter marry a cripple. O' father.. what untoward have you done! No henna is applied in the girl's hand. Her eyes are free from the joy of wedding. There is no nose ring. There is no jewellery on her forehead. She couldn't enjoy the fun. She didn't get anything as gifts. No bed with her, not even a nail. No ritual's ceremony was celebrated. O' father.. what untoward have you done! Mother" give me that flower embroidered cloth. Won't you send me off? Like Sita for Ram and Radha for Shyam. What has happened! Mother, he is my Ram and he is my Shyam! Raj n I! My dear! Mother is crying; sisters are dolorous. People are pleading. The dream of happy married life is broken. The music seems to have stopped playing. What kind of a duty have you fulfilled, King. What have you earned from this? O' father.. what untoward have you done! Fathers choose the best groom possible for their daughters. The choose best of the best and.. ...a find a heavenly abode for them. But you've set an innocent bud amidst the thorns. O' father.. what untoward have you done! Being a King you made your daughter marry a cripple. O' father.. what untoward have you done! I'm sure our trip will be successful. Have you made all the preparations, dear? Yes. I was waiting for you. What is this? Dear, I want to tell you something very important. God helps those who help themselves. You'll face a lot of difficulties if you drag.. ...your husband to different places in this cart. Saint, whether easy or difficult. ...| have to fulfil my duty and I'll fulfil it. Okay dear, then teach him to walk with the help of the clutches. I won't be able to walk, saint. Don't lose hope, son. - I won't be able to walk, saint. At least give it a try. Come on, here, here, here, here! God will do good to you. Come on dear, give me a hand. Give him some support. Come on get up, get up. Say, Almighty. - Aimighty. Almighty- . Almighty.

Listening: pain and sin are erased. Almighty. Almighty. Almighty. Whom did we meet first thing in the morning, Rundiyarama? The day is about to get over but we didn't get a single prey. We didn't even find a single bird! Customers, death and preys are always uncertain, sir. You never know when it will come. I think some animals are coming. The leaves are shaking. I think it's a big animal. Oh no! Who are you? - We're lost travellers, brother. We lost our way and got stuck in the jungle. This jungle is very confusing. But where are you coming from? And where do you want to go? We left for a pilgrimage. Who is he? - My husband. Husband?! - He is a little ill. I can see that. - But how will you reach.. ...the pilgrim places with him? There is no pilgrim place nearby. Right, Rundiyarama? - Yes, sir. The pilgrim place is very far away. Not a problem. We'll reach there one day. Tell me if there is a village close by. We'll spend our night there. There's no village but there's a Shiva temple close by. If you want to spend your night then you can do that there. Come. Your condition is not good. - It's better now. First I was.. Careful. Careful. Mind the bell. This is that temple. You can spend your night here. There is no priest in here? - No devotees come here. Why will the priest stay here? Why? Why don't the people come? It's said that a king made this temple for his favourite queen. And he didn't allow ordinary people to come here. Why? - He didn't want ordinary people to come here. As long as they were alive the temple was taken care of. No one cared about it after they died. Now only lost travellers or wild animals in monsoon. Wild animals? - There is no need to worry. They only come during the monsoons. If you want I can take you to my village. It's just 5 miles away. - Don't take the trouble. It's just a matter of one night. We'll leave in the morning. - As you wish. Okay, we'll make a move then. You took so much trouble for us. - It was my duty. Come on, Rundiya. Come. - Let's go, sir. I think we should lay our bed there. She's so beautiful. She's looking so beautiful even in darkness. She looks like a princess. - You're no less than a prince, sir. You sometimes say very sensible things, Rundiyarama. I'm your sen/ant, sir. Scholars say one shouldn't miss the opportunity in hand. I think you've become very intelligent. I'm just sewing you, sir. My beloved is mesmerising. My beloved is mesmerising. When my entire body sizzles! Life looks so beautiful! I get intoxicated in love. My beloved is mesmerising. Beloved!

Of my heart. I called you my brother. Brother! Will anyone become your brother" ...because you called him so? A woman like you can make sages astray, Menka. No! No! No! Leave me! Leave me! Leave me! Leave her! - No! Leave me! Scoundrel! - Move aside! No! No! - Come! Leave me! Leave me! No, sinner! Leave me! Leave me! Leave me! Leave me! Leave me! No one will come to help you here! - Leave me! Leave me! Leave me! Oh God, please help me. God?! God has punished the sinner. Even I'm a sinner, princess. I couldn't protect my wife. You're not at fault in it. - It is my fault. If I unfortunate was not a cripple.. ...then we wouldn't have to face this day. It is my fault and you'll endure the punishment for it? Don't lose hope. You remember what saint told us? What? O Nanak, the devotees are forever in bliss. Listening: pain and sin are erased. Come, let's go. Gentlemen" and ladies. You won't understand. Why does a man become a sage? And how he becomes one. Five enemies of a person. Lust, anger, greed, ego and attachment. Leave all that. And concentration on your third eye. Concentration on your third eye. Everything else goes away and a person.. ...becomes a sage like me. Tulsi. Tulsi, don't forget two duties in this world. You can give cloth and take mirror. Wonderful. Wonderful. - You are great, sage. Devotees, King Dasrat's chariot's wheel-axle broke. What is a wheel-axle, sage? I didn't understand. You won't. It's which makes the wheel move. And Queen Kekai struck her hand in it. Ladies, she made her hand as axle.. ...and the wheel started moving. Wonderful. - The King was pleased and gives two boons to Kekai. And what did Kekai asked as the boon? Bharat should get to rule and Ram to be sent to exile. Queen Kekai cried. Why did she cry? Because Bharat refused to take the throne. Bharat cried, went to Ram's exile.. ...and brought back his wooden sandals. And he made Lord Ram go barefoot. He walked on the thorns barefooted. His feet were injured and still not healed. You won't understand. Similarly, I was talking about crying. Ravan cried. Why did Ravan cry? Because his brother Vibhishan betrayed him. Similarly, I was talking about crying. Kumbhkaran cried. Why did Kumbhkaran cried? Because he was woken up, devotees. Kabera, your hut is where you stay. What you sow is what you reap. Why do you get so upset? - Wonderful. Wonderful. That's why I tell you to go and rest. And let me do my job. Don't mind it, lady but can I know who is he? He's my husband. - I knew it! I knew it! You won't understand. This is because of my 3rd eye. What? - Tell me is he like this from birth? Or got the disease later. - From birth. Not a problem. Not a problem. Dear, tell me, how many days are there in a year? Yes? About 365 days in a year. 365. And add 10 more to it. 375. Add another 10. 385. Not a major problem. - Problem? You won't understand. I meant he'll get well within 385 days. Really? - You won't understand, devotee. This is all thanks to the three factors The three factors? - You won't understand. It means hymns, meditation and taking God's name. And you can sing hymns, meditate and taking God's name.. ...by sleeping early and getting up early. Since you should go to sleep now. God Almighty! Thief! Thief! - Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief!

Drink. I found water and I found God. I was on fire, but now I've found the water of the Lord's name. This water of the Lord's name has cooled my burning body.

Where are you taking him? - We're going for a pilgrimage. And how did he get this disease? You can take this to be our fate, brother. Fate. Then God will get rid of his sorrows. It's not in the hands of humans. Come. Greetings, Mr. lshwar. - Greetings, brother. These travellers have come from very far away. Give them some water. Fool, collecting the garbage of this vi||age.. ...your brain is filled with garbage too. Nobody lets the leprosy patient enter their village. And you've brought them to our well! Mr. lshwar! - If you were having so much pity on them.. ...then you should have taken them to your well. They are from the higher caste. I couldn't hurt their religious feelings by taking them to my well. Give them some water and they will leave. You fool, anyone who comes across him.. ...will become a leprosy patient. And you want me to feed them water? And get the entire village infested? Go, take them away from here! Did you hear that? You can still heed my advice. Leave me alone. Don't ruin your life for me. A woman's life is not ruined by serving her husband. It makes her life meaningful, dear. You're great, sister. You're great. Didn't you hear me? - Come, sister. I'll take you to the place where.. ...there is no distinguishing between higher or lower caste. Where you're sen/ed water even without asking for it. Come. Shiva! Shiva! They came here to ruin the well. Now devotees I'm going to recite that hymn.. ...of Guru Nanak Dev which is very important of humans. As the seas are overflowing with water, so vast are my own sins. Please, shower me with Your Mercy, take pity upon me. I am a sinking stone: please carry me across! My soul is burning like fire. My soul is burning like fire. And the knife is cutting deep. Prays Nanak, recognizing the Lord's command. I am at peace, day and night. It was such a nice hymn. So meaningful. - Yes. Yes. Saint. - Who is it? It's me, Bhiku. The Bhiku from the lower caste. Come in. Come in, brother. Come in. Come, come, come in. Come. - Saint, they are travellers, they want water. Drink as much water as you want. Saint is a very nice person. Here. Drink this cold water. Make him have it. - They are troubled. They look troubled. But you don't worry, dear. God will make everything alright. That's why I'm taking my husband for a pilgrimage, saint. I'll go and knock at God's door there. God is everywhere, dear. But do what pleases you. I'm sure your husband will surely.. "Get cured because of your devotion. And dear, you can serve him here till he isn't able to walk a little. Take this hut to be your house. Forgive me, saint. I had taken a vow.. "That I'll not be a burden on anyone. Even |won't want that to happen, dear. Travellers come here everyday. I recite Gurbani for them; you can sing hymns for them. You can serve them. Sen/ice too is a kind of devotion, right? Okay dear, rest now. I'll arrange for your meals. Come, brother Bhiku. - Let's go. - Come. Listening: dive deep into the ocean of virtue. Listening: religious scholars, spiritual teachers and emperors. Listening: even the blind find the path. Listening: the unreachable comes within your grasp. O Nanak, the devotees are forever in bliss. Listening: pain and sin are erased. Listening: pain and sin are erased. Listening: even the blind find the path. Listening: the unreachable comes within your grasp. O Nanak, the devotees are forever in bliss. Listening: pain and sin are erased. O' the one who show the way to the blind and the stray. Show us the right path. Here dear, have you meals. Saint, you're taking so much trouble for us. It's not a trouble, dear. This is my duty. Come on, eat it. Son, tell me, don't any of your limbs work at all? My right leg doesn't work at all. The left one works a little. The fingers of his hands don't get straight. Though the hands are fine. - I was born like this, saint. This is God's wrath on me. - No, no, no, son. You shouldn't say such things. Listen brother, today I myself saw it. That leprosy patient and that girl are in that saint's hut. And I knew it from before that that girl won't go from here. She won't be pleased till everyone. ...in this village becomes a leprosy patient. I wonder why the saint kept them in his hut! - Yes. When the girl is young and beautiful.. ...then even old men, sages, saints can astray. What are saints? - Whatever they might be. We won't let this leprosy patient stay in our village. Yes, yes we won't let them stay! If that saint obstructs our way then.. ...we will get him out of our way too! - Yes, Yes! Come! - We'll teach them a lesson! Come! Come! - Come! Dear, this is called the Japji Sahib prayers. Say this prayer everyday. It strengthens your mind. Saint! - Welcome, welcome. How can I help you all? Saint, I'm the chief of this village. And it's my responsibility to look after the village. And these people have come to me with a complaint. Complaint? - Yes. You don't have anyone with you hence you're not concerned. But I won't let leprosy spread in this village. What do you mean? I mean we had thrown him out of this vi||age.. ...and you've made him sit next to you. Isn't a leprosy patient a human being? Must be, but he should live in his place. He shouldn't keep spreading his illness in different villages. This disease is contagious. Who told you this disease is contagious? I don't know. But we won't let him stay here. Yes, yes we won't let him stay here. They are my guests. And no one can take them out of my hut as long as I'm here. Poor girl is taking her sick husband to pilgrimage. Now even such men have wives. I've understood sir, whom is the saint sympathising with. We've understood. Double benefits! Oh God, forgive them! For they don't know what they are saying! Brothers, what are you waiting for? Take him and throw him out! - Yes! Yes! Yes! Stop! No one can touch him as long as I'm alive! What are you looking at! If he doesn't move aside then push him aside! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! No! - Come on! Come on! Stop! Don't hit them! If you want to hit someone then hit me. I'm responsible for all this. Didn't I tell you, princess.. - Princess! Princess! Yes, princess Rajni. King Duni Chand's daughter. The one who was married to me. Fear God. If you blame her then the earth shall come apart. You'll have to face God's wrath. No one should move from their place. Daulay Khan! - Dacoit Daulay! That's him? - Yes. Lalu and Sheera will stay here. And the rest can go and loot the village. As you say, boss. Go! Lalu. - Yes, sir? Take the noose out of her neck. Open her handcuffs and free her. - As you say, boss. Daulay Khan, she is my wife, have mercy on her. I'm having mercy, sir. I'm taking my share without killing anyone. Lalu. - Yes, boss? Wait! Daulay Khan, this atrocity cannot. "Take place as long as I'm here. This is the first time someone has tried to stop Daulay. I'm happy. But I pity your stupidity too, saint. That you want to die for no reason. I too am feeling sorry for your stupidity. Daulay Khan, you consider a right over people's life and death? I don't have time to listen to our preaching, saint. I can just understand the language of swords and guns. This is the most unfortunate thing. - Saint! Daulay Khan, it's your misfortune that. ...you still don't know the aim of your life. You kill people, you loot them. For whom? For myself. For my men, they one who can die for me. And can sacrifice their lives for my life. This is where you're wrong. Your men are not interested in you but the money you looted. He has gone crazy, boss. Don't listen to him. We're ready to sacrifice our lives on one signal of yours. Heard that, saint? Move away. Or else this bullet will go across your body. Shoot. - Saint! I said, shoot me. - I say move aside! Shoot! - Saint! Shoot! - Saint! Boss! Boss! Soldiers are here. Come, let's quickly run away! No, combat! - We didn't come here to die! Boss, our lives are very precious! - Let's go! Cowards! - Daulay Khan! Saint. Saint, did the dacoits come here? Dacoits? - There they are! Follow them! Saint. - You're surprised, Daulay? I did what I did because you're not a bad person. Circumstances must have forced you do some bad deeds. You saw, Daulay, the men you were so proud of.. ...left you alone and fled. You've made me release, saint. Daulay Khan, you've such traits that if you use them.. ...in the right manner then you'll become a great man. A great man? How is that possible? I've killed so many people. I've been so tortuous. God is a forgiver. You'll have a realisation by taking His name. Then you won't be called the dacoit Daulay Khan. You'll be called fakir Daulay Khan. Think of God and recite your prayers. Prayers? I'm an illiterate. I don't know what prayers are, saint. First, Allah created the Light. Then, by His creative power, He made all mortal beings. From the One Light, the entire universe welled up.
