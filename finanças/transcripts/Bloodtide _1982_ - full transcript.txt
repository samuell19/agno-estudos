(Narrator) Before the dawn of civilization, in the early light of man's existence, life was an eternal struggle between good and evil. The ancients knew the way to placate the beast that lurked beneath the eternal sea and within the consciousness of man. Sacrifice. Virgin sacrifice. The practice of that bygone age died with the coming of civilization. But deep in the heart of man the primeval urge to give new life to an ancient ritual lingers on. (Humming) (Gasps) (Roaring) (Roaring intensifies) Come on, darling, let's go. You don't need lip gloss for this. - (Man) I'm just using your liner. - Yeah. Put the top back on. (Man) What are you doing? I'm looking for the perfect music to seduce you with. - (Music playing) - Music... Uh-huh! - Uh-huh! - Uh-huh! Oh, come on, let's go get your sister. Did you ever see the Hebrew version of the bouzouki? - Oh. - (Vocalizes) Let's go, come on. Let's go, come on! If I was avery rich man... Come on! You're gonna miss the sideshow! (Laughs) (Woman) OK, where are all the happy peasants? To hell with the happy peasants! Where's the concessions? I could use a beer. (Camera shutter clicks) Well, my Maid Marian, what would you like to do first, check into the Holiday Inn or play a few sets of tennis, huh? Notice the clay, the remains of Sodom and Gomorrah? (Sighs) I could have swore I was in this place ten minutes ago. Active bunch. If your sister resembles a rock at all, we're gonna have a lot of trouble finding her. (Man chuckles) My God! (Woman) You've got to get this archway. Wait a minute, let's... Let me have your bag. This looks like the Alamo. I tell you, it looks just like the Alamo. The Alamo has been done, dear. I know, darling, but it's so much like the Alamo. Let me steady you backwards. Honey, easy, easy, but don't hold my arm. Don't hold my arm. Sorry. I love this camera, I love this camera. - OK. - (Cat screeching) (Children laughing) (Man) The little bastards! Hello? Was that your cat? That's a very dumb thing to do to a cat, you know? The children do not speak English. Is it your boat which has landed at our dock? Mr. Grice, it is not often that visitors happen on Synoron. I am the mayor of Synoron. I would know when somebody entered her walls. Well, we spoke to a Mr. Evangelou, and he had reason to believe that my sister Madeline came here. She had a strange interest in this island, some particular curiosity. He mentioned something about a monastery. Is there a monastery here? Many islands have monasteries. (Dog barking) If there's any chance, my family, my people, are very concerned. She's been out of touch for over four months. This is a picture of Madeline, taken about three years ago. Her hair is probably a lot longer now. You say your sister is an artist? Yes, an artist. She is very beautiful. Milos was once the place for artists. I no longer know. Santorini, possibly. These are places you should be. You are disappointed I can help you no more. I'm sorry. Dionysis! Dionysis! (In Greek) I want wine! Did you call him Dionysus? Dionysis. But it's like Dionysus, the god of wine and theater. That's really neat, to have an innkeeper called Dionysus who sells wine. How Greek. You are on Greek soil. Seen her? (In Greek) Go to the kitchen! He is an old man. It's OK. The morning's weather promises good for sailing, Mr. Grice. Today, fleets must pray for petroleum instead of wind to send them along. But you will have a pleasant journey nonetheless. Rise with the sun. Yasso. Yasso. "To your health", right? A word of many meanings. Among them, "goodbye". (In Greek) What could I do, brother? I had to go. Dosh is important, you see. (Church bells ringing) - What's the matter? - (Sighs) You know, I don't believe a word those guys are telling me. I think Madeline's here somewhere. (In Greek) My legs don't help. Where are they? Did they disappear into thin air? (Woman) Madeline? I don't know, I couldn't see. Wait here. I'll be right back. (Dog barking) (Creaking) (Man) ...the fountain from the which my current runs or else dries up... (Woman) Would you stop it? â€¦to be discarded thence! You... ...that have the office opposite to Saint Peter and keep the gate of hell! Madeline! You... Who are you? No! It's OK. He's my brother. I kissed thee ere I killed thee. No way but this. Neil! Meet my sister. (Greek song on radio) Well... Here's to the family reunion. Let's cut the shit out here, man, huh? What's going on here, Madeline? I come to this crazy island to look for you and your friend here takes a knife to my throat. Who are you, anyway? Some latter-day Paul Robeson spewing Shakespeare to the natives? (Madeline) Don't mind Frye. He played Othello once in college and never quite got over it. (Neil) Ah, Othello in college. OK, my midsummer night's dream. (Woman laughs) Rude am I in my speech, and little blessed with the soft phrase of peace. Cut it out, Frye. OK, OK. You weren't expected, and the natives here aren't exactly friendly. Speaking of the natives, Madeline, they don't even know who you are. I showed them a picture and they didn't recognize you. And I know that you two stick out here like man Friday and Mrs. Crusoe. Personally, I think the natives here are the ones that stick out. And there's no explaining their little ways, unless Madeline can explain it. She's gone a little native herself lately. What's he talking about, Madeline? I'm fine. I paint, draw... I'm fine. It was stupid of Father to send you off on your honeymoon. Well, it wasn't really a honeymoon. it was kind of a vacation after the event. So, little brother's gotten married! Yeah. Yeah, well, it was his idea. I mean, we were living together, we were really happy, but he wanted to make it legal. Your brother is really straight. Did you know that? It's nice to see somebody in the family is. Shut up, Frye. (Music playing on radio) Huh! I didn't finish the front. It got dark and I got pooped. He makes me clean the boat. Every day sometimes. Thinks salt water's bad for it. Thing he doesn't know is the water in this place is worse. (Music stops) I make you do what? Well, he doesn't make me, I guess. I guess I'd go stir-crazy if I didn't do something. Oh, wow, what am I doing? I'm sorry, my name is Barbara. - Call me Babs. - I'm Neil. - This is Sherry. - Pleasure. I'm Madeline's brother. Oh, I bet that's your hot boat down at the dock, huh? Expensive. - Yeah, it's rented. We got it in Athens. - Oh, neat! Does it have a compressor to fill air tanks? I mean, a good one? Yeah. We brought our dive gear, but I didn't think it'd be so difficult to get tanks here. Oh, you better believe it. They're against the law here, you know. They don't like people to take things out of the water. No scuba tanks, boy. If they ask you, you just tell them you're fishing. You dive, I take it. Uh... sponge diving. Bit off-season, of course, but when you find them, they're marvelous. Sponges? What do you mean, "sponges"? I thought it was those... Joke, Barbara. And like your sister, I'm a bit of an amateur archeologist myself. Only I work down below and she works on top of the hill. It's really more interesting on top of the hill, isn't it, Madeline? Why don't you tell them about the priceless discovery you made, dear? I hear the nuns really love it. I'm sure they're not interested. You're being a bore, Frye. I don't want to be one, too. You're not staying for dinner? No, I... I must go. Is she alright? That's just mad Madeline. Oops, I'm sorry, she's your sister. Well, she's not really... Well, she's just a little, you know, kind of... Shut up, Barbara. (In Greek) I don't want to lose you again and have to look for you in the dead of night. Come on in! Come on! Come in! Just a moment to light the lamp. It won't take me long. What can you do? This is "parathiro", a window. This is "porta", a door. This is "krevati", a bed. (Snores) (Laughs) - I feel like I'm in a crypt. - Yeah. I think they call this "quaint". Oh, shit! Come on. (Coughs) There. Give me a little massage, will you? First, fourth and seventh vertebrae. Please. OK. Now that we're married, no more pampering. - (Groans) - How's that? You like it? Now, I know something's bothering you. You want a little hug therapy? Or primal scream? - How about some S&M? - (Grunting) Come on. You're worried about it. Talk! Ooh! Yes, I am. I mean, it's been quite a day, you know? Sadistic little bastards throwing black cats in my face, old men with bad memories, some guy takes a knife to my jugluar... It's "jugular". J... jugular. And, er... and my sister seems to have gone completely nuts. - I heard Mexico is much worse, dear. - Yeah, much worse. (Laughs) Stop! OK, OK, OK, OK... OK! (Laughs) (Gentle moaning) Look, it's really simple. Your sister is into some good drugs and Frye is giving her a decent price. Hmm... Well, I wouldn't put it past her. But I think Frye is a crook. I feel like I'm rocking around even when I'm standing on dry land. I don't wanna sleep in this big waterbed tonight. God, man, I'm out here all day long. "Clean the deck, clean the head, clean the fish..." You promised me Capri two months ago, and all I've seen is... fish guts. Boy, when that guy said he'd give me a lift to Barstow, I should have thought twice. Barbara, Capri is overrated and\ overcrowded this time of the year. And, eh... you know, I want you all to myself. Oh, Frye... Here. Put that up front. What is it? More fish guts. (Distant hum of an engine) Shh! Was I kissing too loud? No. You hear it? It's a boat. Come on, you worry too much. Nobody's gonna steal our boat. (Frye) Barbara! Barbara! Flippers! You know, I was thinking... This place down there, the place you keep going down to, it scares me when you go down there. Why can't you find some place up here to look? How did it get down there, anyway? You said it was... - Up... - Barbara, long time ago it was up here. Then came the big earthquake... Ptchoo! Now it's down there. Got it? Mm. Now, remember, no lights and no sound. - OK? - Yes. Uh. (Grunts) (Laughs) (Grunts) It is the cause. Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars! â€™tis... the cause. (Muffled) Yet I'll not shed her blood... (Continues indistinctly) (Frye) Yet she must die, or else she'll betray more men. Now... you just don't dare. Good luck to you, Mr. Jack Daniels. Put out the light. And then... put out the light. (Roaring) Another day. (Roaring) (Gasps) I come here all the time. It's kind of my private place. I call it "Little Malibu". You can walk here - but I'd much rather drive your boat. - Oh, yeah? (Barbara) I love your machine. It's so cute. Whoo! (Barbara laughing) Hey, Frye, look at this thing Neil's got. Can we get one? You get me a melon. Can we have one, please? Hey! And a loaf of bread. Ooh... You know, you don't have to let him talk to you that way. Oh... it has its compensations. Oh, yeah? Like what? Hmm... I could tell you a lot of things. It's OK, I understand. I've got one just like him. He's so cute. Hi. You know you don't have any strap marks at all? Right. Meditating? TM? Zen? I tried to meditate for a while but I kept, you know, finding myself thinking about where my khaki pants were, whether they went to the laundry or the cleaner's or something. There you go. Who told you to bring a knife? You don't cut watermelons with a knife. Oh, big man! (Sherry) Yeah, well, Neil and I were talking the other night and he said that he'd missed your last two birthdays, so we decided we'd just get you a little something. Here. Madeline? Madeline? Madeline, it's... A birthday present. We didn't know what you wanted, so we just got the most expensive one we could find. It's... It's, erm... expen... It's really expensive. It's not toilet water, Madeline, it's... You don't want to get it on your hair. Are you OK? No. (Chuckles) What kind of perfume are you wearing? It's not me. It's the new perfume your sister is drenched in. Come on! Look, if you hadn't been so busy back there, playing with your brand-new silly toy from Abercrombie & Fitch, you would have noticed that your sister drenched herself in four ounces of Jean Patou's best. What are you talking about? She poured the entire bottle of our perfume all over herself. (Neil) Bullshit! (Sherry) Look, I don't know why she did it, but I'm worried about her. (Scraping) What the hell? I think we hit something. We hit something alright! One of your props has cracked. What did you see? A log, a shoal, what? I don't know. Look, we have the finest depth sounder money can buy. I mean, it says we're in 300 feet of water. You know, it doesn't really sound that bad. Why don't you try it full-throttle for a minute? Look! (Sherry) See? They don't really hate Americans. They do get a bit restless. You have damaged your boat? A young girl went swimming in these waters this morning. She has not yet returned. She is still missing. Jesus, you think we hit her? We were a mile and a half out of port. No boat will sail on our seas. Huh, you're crazy! Panayiotis! Best to play their game. These Greeks aren't known for their rationality. Give 'em 24 hours and they'll lay out a barbecue for you. (Nun praying indistinctly in Greek) (Continues praying) (Nun) Madeline! There is trouble in the village? There's a young lady missing and they fear she may have drowned. (In Greek) May Christ be with her. (In English) Sister Anna wishes to see you, Madeline. Thank you. (In Greek) May Christ be with you. You have been down to the village. My brother has come to visit me. I was with him today. There's a girl missing, and the village men are trying to blame him. Those of the village blame the sun and the wind... for their misfortune as well. May Christ be with her. Hmm. This faded icon, which for so long sat draped at our altar, has brought you many hours of happiness. And to us as well, in Christ. In my reading I discovered many such icons. But it's quite something else to have discovered one for myself. The original painting was covered by centuries of candle fumes. The image's disappearance was considered a miracle, but... of course it remained intact under the soot. When I began to expose the colors... I found another layer beneath. And by using the stripping process I told you of... I removed the first icon, remounted it... and beneath... What is it, Sister? I'm not sure. I think I like the other one more. Good triumphs over evil. This one... itâ€™s almost as if evil were about to triumph over good. Perhaps it's just a question of style. Oh, please, Madeline, sometimes you forget I'm just a simple woman. All I know is that I'm glad Saint Michael kills the dragon. There is something you haven't told me. Sister Anna, I've discovered that there's a third layer beneath this one. It would seem very, very old. Madeline... it disturbs me that you have stopped taking the Holy Communion. It's the wood from the panel. It's very, very old. It would date the layer of the third icon. This icon... is work unto Jesus Christ. It could not possibly be older than Him. The men in the village knew it. They told me it was made extinct by a blight in 1521 BC. Before Christ. The men in village told me. Take the bread of the Eucharist, the chalice, - and be one with the body of Christ. - (Church bells ringing) No, dumb-ass! - Over there! - (Neil) Come on. OK, here. (Neil) Good birdie! That's already 100 calories for you. Now, go fly that off. You're welcome. (Electronic music playing) (Camera shutter clicks) Now focus, girl. (Camera shutter clicking) - (Sherry) Don't antagonize 'em. - Antagonize 'em! Are you aware that these people are holding us hostage here? I wish this was a machine gun, then I could play "The Great Escape". (Camera shutter clicking) Wait a minute. Now, look, if they don't have a telephone line, they've got to have a two-way radio, or at least a marine radio. - Think about it. - Take it easy. Frye and Madeline seem to have run into this before. (Electronic music playing on radio) (Gasps) Perverts! Dirty old men! I thought you Greeks only liked little boys! (Screams) Why do I linger so far off the beaten path so long past my welcome? (Laughs) Beaten paths are for beaten men. (Laughs) (Man shouting outside, in Greek) Nereus, come to the square! - We found a shark! - (In Greek) A shark? A shark! Nereus, a boat is approaching! Come to the square! We found a shark! - (In Greek) Where are you? - Come to the square. We found a shark! (Chattering) (Hubbub of conversation) (In Greek) The blonde girl. - We had gone to... - Just aa moment. One at a time. Jesus, what the hell is this? Labor Day Weekend? (In Greek) One at a time! Yannis, what? Be quiet, please. Let Yannis speak. We saw the blonde girl. She was swimming. - And the shark attacked her. - What happened? (In English) They say there was a shark that attacked a girl. - The woman who was missing? - No, no. (In Greek) While we were standing there, the shark was eating the girl. We saw it for ourselves. We saw the girl and the shark that attacked her. (Neil) There was a shark attack. (In English) She disappeared into the sea. She never came back. There aren't any goddamn sharks in these waters. (Frye) Barbara? No, it's the woman from the village. Barbara! Barbara! (Chanting in Greek) O Lord Where all your saints repose Give rest also to the souls Of Your servants For You alone Are immortal (In Greek) Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us. Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us. Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us. Glory to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Both now and forever and to the ages... - Stop! - Stop! Hail, God of water. They are waiting for the virgin in your mouth. Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Stop! No! You do your voodoo on your own people. (In English) Fare for Charon, Mr. Frye, in order that he may ferry these poor spirits beyond the River Styx. (In Greek) Hail, servant of the death. Hail! Hail! - Hail! - Hail! Hail! Hail! You stupid old bastard! - Lethe! - Lethe! - Lethe! - Lethe! Lethe! (In Greek) Lethe, come and play with us. Lethe is staying at home. She can't come with you. Do you hear that? Go back to your houses! Get out of here! (Laughing) (Sherry) Frye! Frye! Hey, Frye! - Frye! - Frye! (Sighs) What could that bastard be doing down there? (Roaring) Don't even think about it! Oh, well, I was just thinking that I went to all this trouble to get these tanks, I... I just figured I'd go down and, uh... (releases air) blow one off. There's a goddamn shark in that water! Frye's right, there are no whites, blues or makos or anything like that around here that would attack a man. OK, how do you explain the two women they buried this morning? And besides, we shouldn't even be out here. We're almost out of diesel fuel. You're not going in the water! Yeah, it just had to be you, mad Maddy's little brother! You know, you're quite a family. A screwed-up virgin and a spoiled, nosy kid. What are you, anyway? Just another poor little rich kid looking for kicks? What's your particular bag, huh? Ecology? Huh? Global politics? I don't know what the hell you're talking about, but take this damn thing out of my face. What I'm talking about is you're getting on my back, sneaking down here out of school hours, screwing up for reasons best known to yourself. I don't know what the hell you're talking about, Frye, or what it is you think I've done. So, you're a goddamn broken-down diver trying to pick up a few bucks. I don't give a shit! I'd expect to find a guy like you in a hole like this. But for what it's worth... this is the first time I've been down here. If you didn't screw up my gear... who in the hell did? What are you doing? What the hell does it look like I'm doing? Getting my Maundy together and getting the hell out of here! Now, if you have any sense, you do the same thing. You and wifey, go! Just do it, scram! Because I tell you, this whole set-up has got me scared shitless. What about my sister? What about your sister? Your sister! Listen, Madeline was the one who brought me to this place. The trip to this little island was her idea. Yes, she found this hole all by herself. You got it? Madeline found it, not me! And one day, something got to her. Just like it's getting to me right now. And it's gonna get to you. This morning they buried two women and one of them, strangely enough, I was quite fond of. Yeah, time is running out for all of us. You're being too aggressive. You're gonna alienate her. What if he's lying? Madeline finding an underwater cave, do you believe it? I do. Madeline! Sh... This must be Madeline's room. This is the icon she was talking about. (Sister Anna) You must leave at once. Madeline is under the sanctity of St. Cosmas. Here is a sacred ground. I've come to take my sister home. You cannot enter. You have brought here nothing but death on this island with your boats and machine. You must leave at once! Get out! Get out! - Madeline! - Neil, come on! There's nothing more I'd rather do than get off this island, with my sister! Madeline! Madeline, we're not leaving this island without you. (Sherry) Come on! (Neil) Madeline, we'll be waiting for you. (Chanting in Greek) Little Lethe is crying Because her girlfriends don't play with her Get up, close your eyes... Lethe! Look at the sun and say goodbye Little Lethe is crying Because her girlfriends don't play with her... Lethe! Get up, close your eyes Look at the sun and say goodbye Little Lethe is crying Because her girlfriends don't play with her Get up, close your eyes f (Screams) Holy mother! Help! Help! Help! Lethe! Lethe! Argh! Help! Argh! (Engine chugging) Alley-oop! Her mother's... - I searched. - And, uh... what did you find, Mr. Frye? You have seen your death, Mr. Frye. (Traditional Greek music playing) (Dionysis laughing) (Sherry) I thought you said he was gone. Well, I thought you'd picked up your gear and went for the hills, Hopalong. - What? - (Sherry) What are you doing here? (Neil) Grabbed your loot and headed for the hills. Oh! You two haven't heard. - What? - What? What? (Neil) What? What were you gonna say? Just another happy little day on Synoron. Don't drink it. Happy little kids. Tried to murder a little girl. Her mommy jumps in, trying to save her, and... - Gobble, gobble! - Gobble, gobble, what? - What? - What did you see? You know me. Oldest lifeguard on the beach. Plunged right in. Grabbed the little bitch. Tried to... save her from... - From what? - Frye, from what? Save her from what? Frye! (Church bells ringing) Madeline! Not tonight. I have fear tonight. There is evil about. Come and pray. - Come. - I can't. What I've started, I must finish. (Roaring) (Traditional Greek music playing) - (In Greek) Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers, Konstantis! - Cheers, Yannakis! (Humming) Neil, I'm scared. Do something. Do what, Mrs. Grice? Please do not interfere with our local customs. At best, it will be ill-mannered. At worst, it would be sacrilege. You come here as tourists, we offer you a little local color, a young girl going to communion. No! (Music strikes up) (Music over dialogue) You crazy old devil! What new evil are you trying to conjure up now? Mr. Frye, there is no such thing as "new evil". Evil is old and has always been with us. And far from conjuring it up, the small ritual which you are witnessing had its origins thousands of years ago and was designed to ward off, to placate evil. The same evil that you, Mr. Frye, have disturbed and aroused from its ancient sleep. (Roaring) (In Greek) In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us. Glory to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Are you asking us to believe... that some... some thing out there in the sea... loose... is gonna keep on killing until some stupid bitch sacrifices herself to it? Not just out there, Mr. Grice. The legend tells that it moves freely between land and sea. And not just any woman. The woman in question will know. She will realize her destiny and give herself freely. She will find fulfilment, and we... peace. (Screams) (Praying indistinctly in Greek) (Screaming) (Traditional Greek music playing) (Man sings in Greek) Stone of Monemvasia Stone of Monemvasia And castle of Lamia... J A sibyl, that had numbered in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses, in her prophetic fury sewed the work. (Song continues) Easy, come on. Easy... - Come on. - (In Greek) Dionysis, bring some water. Holy mother! The monster. - Madeline! - Oh, God! (Sister Anna groans) So, the little virgin... is finally going to give up herself. (Neil) Madeline! Madeline! Madeline! Madeline! It's the dinghy, Frye. It's down there. I saw it. Madeline! Madeline! Madeline! Smote him... Listen, do you have any extra regulators, some tanks? - A speargun? -... thus. Frye! Get to the anchor! (Beeping) (Roaring) Frye! Frye! Madeline! Madeline! Madeline! It's me, Neil. It's alright. Easy, Madeline. Easy! (Screams) (Coughs) (Frye) Get her out of here! Get her out of here! I took by the throat the circumcised dog and smote him, thus. Frye! Get out! It's alright, baby. Turn around. Grab hold of the rope. Just grab the rope! You gotta breathe, Madeline, on the regulator. On the regulator, Madeline. Just put in your mouth. Here, just breathe. I'll do the rest. Come on! Madeline! Listen, just breathe. Here. Here. Come on. (Nereus) It's over!
