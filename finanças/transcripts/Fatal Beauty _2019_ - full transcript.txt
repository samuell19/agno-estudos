[instrumental music] [audience cheering] [man whistling] [camera clicks] [dramatic music] [crowd whistling] [crowd whistling] [music continues] [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] [sighs] [woman] So he takes my design, slaps the company logo on it and submits it anonymously. And I'm supposed to be cool with that because I'm a team player. Oh, hey, uh, the couple that bought Harold's house moved in today. Wow! Thanks for the emotional support there, Trev. I am supporting you, just quietly. By changing the subject? By not disagreeing with you. - Do the new neighbors have kids? - I don't know, kiddo. Maybe. I'm supposed to just suck it up is what you're saying? It kinda seems like you're putting words in my mouth. Mom, can I be excused? - Am I wrong? - Mom? [clears throat] Look, everybody knows it's your work. So just, I don't know, b-boost the firm, not the individual. I guess, I-I understand the mentality is all. What is it about being unemployed that turns everybody into a communist? - What's that supposed to mean? - It's a joke, Trev. - Lighten up. - Can I be excused? I'm the one who needs to lighten up. Copy that. Yes, honey, you can be excused. [sighs] I'm sorry. I shouldn't take it out on you. I should just put my head down and do the work. Anyway, forget it. What about the new neighbors? Nothing. They seemed nice. I didn't know the house was for sale. The old man's only been dead for two weeks. It's a hot market. Gotta move fast. [mellow music] [car engine starts] -[tires screeching] - Oh! Oh! [sighs] [chuckles] I don't know where my head's at this morning. That's what you have me for. Don't forget to pick up Clio after practice. I'm on it. Great. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Hey, excuse me! I am sure it's something super simple. I've just been pressing the same buttons over and over again for the last half hour. [chuckles] - Oh-oh! -[laughs] Yeah. -[woman] Oh, my God. Awesome. - Yeah. - All right. Okay. -[woman] Cool. Well, um, just... Sorry. - Uh, just... - Mm-hmm. Let me know if you need help with anything else. Um, I noticed you around during the day. - Do you work from home or... -[machine whirring] - Uh... [chuckles] Yeah. -[laughs] - Yeah, mostly, um... yeah. - Doing what? I, uh, do some consulting and music, but right now I'm kind of in between gigs. And your wife? Wife, right? Yes. Yeah, wife. Renee. She works at an architectural firm. Cool. She's an architect. Architectural designer. Isn't that, like, kinda the same thing? [laughs] Uh, apparently no. No, not according to her. Yeah. [clears throat] Hey, actually, you know what? Uh, the two of you should come by sometime this week for, like, drinks and dinner, and then we can let you in on the deep, dark secrets of the neighborhood. Cool, I'd love that. - Yes, I'll figure something out. - Okay. Thanks. [Trevor] Nope! All right, you got this, slugger. Come on. [Trevor whistling] [crowd cheering] [Trevor] Make him pay, kiddo. You got this. -[Trevor] Swing! -[Clio grunts] [crowd cheering] Yeah! That's my girl! [crowd cheering] Let's go! Let's go! Safe! Yeah! [Clio grunts] What'd you say... [screaming] Come on, Pat, dig it! Okay! -[grunting] - Ow. Look, I don't care what he said to you. Okay? I really don't. Okay, I give up. What did he say? [indistinct whispering] What? Okay. Good job. We're not gonna tell mom, but I'm glad you hit him. -[giggles] - You did great. No fights, okay? You mean, like, with Clio or you mean, like, you and me? All fights. Well, I'm down. Well, I don't know about Clio. - That girl's a warrior. - Yeah. - Where did she get that from? - I don't know. Hm. Where could she get that from? - Xena. -[chuckles] You know, I think we should have the neighbors over for dinner. Uh, yeah. - No? - No. Ye-yes. Yeah. Um, I actually, already mentioned it to Kaylie, so... - Kaylie? - Yeah. I think that's her name. Great. Did, uh, did you and Kaylie set a date? No. Just, you know, mentioned it in passing. Like, "Hey, you and your husband should come over for dinner sometime." Nothing specific. Yeah, o-okay. Yeah, sure. We should do that. [chuckles] Okay. What was the husband's name? Uh, it's Ray, I think. [Ray] Then they told me I can paint the house any color I want as long as it's Boston Brick or Wedgewood Gray. [Trevor] Oh, welcome to our homeowner's association. - Your home is beautiful. - Mm. Like a museum. My great-grandfather built it. It's been in the family ever since. - Yeah. - Ooh, Ray? Ah, what the hell? - Yeah. Yeah. - I'm not driving, right? So Kaylie says you're in the music business. Yes, yeah, I've, uh, I've done some session work off and on, but, ah, with the way the music business is right now, it's, it's more off than on. [Renee] He's amazing. If Stevie Ray Vaughan and Andres Segovia had a love child... You should hear him play. - I wo... I'd like that. -[Ray] Wait, Andres who? Hey, Clio, what's your favorite animal? [virtual assistant] Boo the Space Hamster. -[Clio laughs] - Oh, my God. You guys have one of those smart thingies. Yeah, well, as soon as she found out that there was one with her name, she insisted on it. Although, it can get a little messed up at times. Hey, Clio, do you know that you're beautiful? [virtual assistant] Life is beautiful. No, seriously. I mean it. You are such a beautiful little girl. You're like a princess. Tsk. Oh, she doesn't really do the princess thing. We don't really believe in gender stereotypes. Uh-huh, but every girl wants to be a princess, don't they? I guess. Ever thought about being in a beauty pageant? Oh, my gosh, you remind me so much of me at your age. It's crazy. I can't get over it. My dad was a pageant judge. - No way! - I was. - Wow! - Whoa! - Where the hell did that go? - Oh, gosh. Here. - Let me top you off. -[Ray] Sure. [Trevor] Yeah. [Ray] Pour away. [Renee] So did any of you see the news? Apparently, the riots in Cleveland are the worst since Ferguson. Ah, that's right, yeah, it's like a dozen people killed so far. God gave us so many incredible blessings, but also the responsibility to look after those less fortunate than ourselves. It's like, if we could just love one another and look past our differences, we could end hate in our lifetime. Wow, that is so true and just... beautiful. Hm. Seriously? What's that? I better get dessert. - Can I help? - No. No, I'm, I'm good. Yeah. It's okay. - Well, this has been great. - Yes. Thank you so much for having us. - Of course. Yeah. - This is amazing. [sighs] [indistinct chatter] [Trevor] They make it. [Ray] Yeah. -[Ray] Oh, that looks delicious. - Ice-cream! -[Ray] Nice job. - Yeah. So you and Ray... how did you two meet? - I'm sorry? - How did you get together? - When was your OMG moment? - She thinks we're... Um... [chuckles] Oh, my gosh, no. Uh... Ray is... He's my-my big brother. I've known him my whole life. Believe me, no OMG moments so far. -[chuckles] -[Renee] I though you said... Oh, no, I... I don't think I said either way. [Kaylie] Oh, no, no, I-I can totally understand why you two thought that, but, no. Ray and I, we, we've been living together for about a year. We were living with my mother until she passed away, and we inherited some money and we just kinda wanted to make a change. - And get out of there, you know? -[Trevor] It's really cool. Uh, not about your mom, obviously, but... - Right. Thank you. - Thanks. Yeah. We've both been going through some changes and we wanted to stick together for the time being. We're the only family we have left and family is everything. - Yeah. - Right, princess? - Right. - Mm-hmm. - Cheers to family. - Yeah. -[Ray] To family. [mellow music] [birds chirping] [Renee] So I'm gonna be late tonight. We have a big deadline at work, and yours truly has to do all the heavy lifting, anonymously. - Again. - Ow! But happy anonymous. Well, don't you worry about us because I am gonna whip up another fantastic meal of dead skin and rodent droppings. Sorry to miss that. Clio, can you add frozen dinners to the grocery list? [virtual assistant] What type of frozen dinners would you like? - Pizza! - What? [virtual assistant] Adding frozen pizza. Speaking of dinner, the birthday boy needs to think about where he wants to go for his birthday dinner next week. Oh, it's my birthday already again? Every year around this time. Yeah. No birthday. No! [sighs] Did you do your homework? Yeah? - Hey, what was that? - What? Well, I mean, it's the first time I've ever seen you go around the puddle and not through it. - No. - Hm. Is my little tomboy turning into a little lady? I don't know what you're talking about. - Are you, are you a little lady? - No. Oh, that was very lady-like. That was... Oh, are you pushing me?

Oh, I plied him with, like, a gallon of wine last night. - Oh, my gosh, don't feel bad. - Oh. He's an awful human being when he's sober. I hate to say it, but that's, that's the God's honest truth. Well, listen, it's none of my business and-and probably out of line, but it sounds like maybe you guys could use some help. Yeah, I've tried. He says he's done with all that. And I have my own issues with the profession, you know? Yeah. But, hey, we, we hardly know each other. That's so not, not your problem. Thank you for the beer and the serenade. Yeah, it's my pleasure. - Kaylie, wait! -[gasps] Oh, my goodness! Hi, sweetheart. Why aren't you inside doing your homework? -'Cause you're here. - Well... I was just about to leave, but not before... this. [squeals] Do you like it? [gasps] It's just the beginner's crown. I'm sure there will be more. Okay, okay. Go inside. Bye! -[sighs] - You didn't have to do that. Oh, it's just my way of saying thank you for an amazing dinner. I hope she likes it. Well, if she doesn't wear it, I will. [laughs] It will look good on you. - Mm. - Bye. Bye. [guitar music] [Ray] What's that? Oh, God. This again? Come on. Not today. [Kaylie] Get your life together. [Ray] Get what life together? I don't have anything to get together! [indistinct yelling] [Trevor] We had fried chicken because I make what she likes, and what she likes is fried chicken. Yes, tomorrow I will make an entire plate of fresh vegetables. See how that goes over. Mm-hmm. I love you. - Bye. -[knocking on door] - Hey. - Hey. [sniffles] I, uh, I didn't know where else to go, so... Yeah, no. Uh, come in. [dog barking in distance] Do you want something to drink? Is, uh, scotch okay? - Sure. Yeah. - Okay. So what happened?

Yeah, I told him he's crazy, he... - Mm. - He didn't really like that. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I don't... I don't think crazy people usually like being called crazy, so... I'm sorry, am I making you uncomfortable? No, no, just that... - Uh... - I should go. No, wait, uh... You don't have to if-if you don't want to. Okay. What are you, what are you doin'? - Ah.

[chuckles] - Oh. I'm sorry, what happened? I got home so late last night, so there was no point in coming to bed. I killed the alarm so you could sleep in. - What about... - We are good. Clio has had her breakfast, she's upstairs getting ready for school. - I'm sorry. - Don't be. It's nice to be mommy every now and again. - I could use the practice. - Hm. You okay? [clears throat] - Yeah. - You sure? Positive. Okay. -[engine starts] - Oh, hey. [sighs] Oh, thanks. I am really gonna need this today. [sighs] Have a good day. [Renee] Mwah! [guitar music] [door opens] [moans] [vehicle approaching] - Hi, daddy. - Hey, kiddo. Come here. - What was that for? - Hm. What, is it illegal to give your daughter a hug? - No. - No? [cell phone vibrating] Who's that? It's nobody. - So tell me. - Hm. What is on the tap for today? - Geometry. - Geometry? - Ooh. - But first, I need chocolate. 'Cause it helps me think. - Yeah? -[Clio] Yeah. Okay. I think there's some in the pantry. [Clio] Yay! - This is hard. - It's supposed to be hard. Clio, how do you calculate the area of a trapezoid? [virtual assistant] The area of the trapezoid is equal to half of its height times the sum of the lengths of the two parallel sides. Hey, little lady, I'm pretty sure that's cheating. - I don't think so. - Hm? - Clio, how do calculate the... - Oh. [virtual assistant] I'm sorry, can you repeat that? Clio, don't answer. [virtual assistant] Okay, Trevor. Kaylie Drake left you a voice note. -Would you like to hear it? - Yes! [Trevor] No! [virtual assistant] "I just wanted to tell you what a fantastic time I had last night, Trevor." - What did you and Kaylie do? - Nothing. I just, uh, I played her one of my songs, is all. Hey, Clio, you can go ahead and erase that message. [virtual assistant] Message deleted, Trevor. You, homework. And by yourself. [woman] You had it all, remember? [sighs] Shame, in the end you just couldn't seal the deal. You let all those small, pathetic men walk right over you like a doormat. Don't worry, hon. You'll always be my little sweetheart. [screams] [knocking on door] - Hi. - Hey. We need to talk. Come on in. Oh, sorry for all the mess. We're still unpacking. I'm afraid, all I can offer you is instant coffee. Oh, thank you. Hey, look. There's, uh, there's something I need you to understand. I don't have a clue where half this stuff is gonna go. It's a little overwhelming, to be honest. Hey, listen, about last night... It can never happen again. - Okay. [chuckles] - I-I mean it. O-okay, bye. Well, it was a mistake. O-obviously, it was my mistake. Well, then you can just tell your wifey and be done with it. Hey, is everything good between you two? Things seem a little, well, I don't know, strained. I have a pretty good nose for that sort of thing. I was kind of hoping we can leave her out of this. That's kind of hard to do, considering... Considering what? I mean, Kaylie, we... We didn't even, uh, go all the way. Oh. "All the way?" I feel like I'm at summer camp. You were inside me, babe-asaurus. Accidentally left this thing running last night. How stupid is that? Maybe I'll accidentally release a sex tape. [Trevor moaning on phone] Uh-uh! Blip. [cell phone beeps] In the cloud. Okay, look, whatever it is that you're thinking about doing or w-whatever this is, just... It's over. Do you understand? I mean, i-it never even was. One and done. Got ya. Wow, y-you, on the outside you are a very beautiful woman, but on the inside, you're s... Now I'm beautiful on the inside, too. - What do you want from me? - I don't know. An apology? Okay. Fine, then I'm sorry. Okay? - I'm sorry for whatev... - Not feelin' it, Trev. Is this about money? Trevor, you have no money. I'd be taking it from your wife, and I have nothing against her. Besides, I would never wanna do anythin' to that wonderful, little girl who I absolutely adore. No, it needs to be more personal. Needs to come directly from you. [gasps] I know. A finger. It's like how the Japanese gangsters apologize, right? - You can't be serious. - Come on. It's not like I'm asking you for your arm or your balls or anything. Just one little finger. You can even make it the pinky finger if you want, which isn't even really a finger. When you stop to think about it, it's more like half a finger. I'm not listening to this. Seems like a pretty small price to pay for the woman you claim to love. There's even a tribe in Africa that cuts off a finger when they get engaged. How romantic is that? I think 24 hours should be sufficient, don't you? Let's make the cut-off at 5 p.m. tomorrow. So to speak. [mellow music] [Kaylie laughs] [Clio] You are funny. [Clio chuckles] [Kaylie] Turn around. Let me see your hair. [indistinct chatter] -[Kaylie] Oh, my... - Hey, Clio! Hi, daddy! [chuckles] You know what Kaylie and Ray call themselves? - Raylie. -[both laughing] Time to get inside, kiddo. - Don't forget... - Now. Inside. [door opens] - She's here! -[Renee laughs] Hey. Ah, what did I miss? I'm sorry. I lost track of time. Ooh, something smells good. Mm. You're angry. I should've called. I'm sorry. No, it's fine. You're busy, so... No, it's not. You cooked. The least I could do is be home on time to eat it. Oh, it's good. It's really good. I petted a skunk today. Really? You don't smell like you petted a skunk. [Clio] It wasn't that kind of skunk. What other kinds of skunk are there? [Clio] The kind that doesn't smell. Hey, we don't talk with our mouth full. Well, he must've had his scent glands removed. [Clio] Yeah. You have to do it when they're babies, though. So I got a call from Kaylie asking if I wanted to have coffee tomorrow. Great. - You done? - Mm-hmm. Thank you. No more late-nights. I promise. Unless it's more than that. You'd tell me if it was, wouldn't you? Yeah. "Yeah," what? [chuckles] Yeah, I would tell you if it's more. [mellow music] [screaming] - Trevor? - Hm? [cheering] [grunts] [crowd cheering] What's going on, kiddo? I guess I just don't feel much like playing anymore. What? You love the game. I know, but... - But what? - It's not feminine. "It's not feminine?" Okay. Hey, it's all right. It's okay.

Hey, Clio, where are you? [virtual assistant] Right here, Trevor, metaphysically speaking. [clanking] Ouch. Hey, Clio? Clio! [birds chirping] [knocking on door] Hello? Hello? [instrumental music on stereo] [music continues] [grunting] -[groans] -[laughing] I have a right to defend my home. Unfortunately, that doesn't give me a legal right to kill an unarmed intruder. You know that sucks. You can get murder, too, just for protecting what's yours. [sighs] Not that I'm bitter or nothin'. [coughing] You're all right. - Just breathe. - My daughter. What about her? Where is she? You have to ask my sis. [Ray whistling] Hey. I heard you're thinking about chopping off a finger. Bit of practical advice. The best way is to smash your funny bone really hard. Like this. [Ray groans] [laughs] Uh... Your hand goes completely numb for about ten seconds and that should give you enough time to get the job done. If you're quick about it. You see, the trick is not to hesitate. [instrumental music on stereo] ♪ Ooh yeah [door opens] ♪ Look away ♪ Yeah Hi, daddy. ♪ Look away You go home and you wash that off now. - But... - Now! All of it! Hey, come here. I'm not mad at you, kiddo. Okay? But Kaylie needs to know what she did was wrong. But we thought you'd like it. Clio wanted to give you a big surprise for your birthday. Come on, let's go. I'll meet you down there. What the hell is wrong with you? You still don't get it, do you? Let me throw you a lifeline, cutie. Remember a certain Miss Whittier Beauty Pageant? Six years ago? There was a contestant, a pretty blonde and a pageant judge who said some really awful things about her. Bing! You were blonde then. [chuckles] So typical. You change your hair and a dude doesn't even recognize you anymore. So all of this, uh, all of this is what? Because you were offended? Oh, all this? All of this is for telling the other judges I tried to seduce you. Yeah, you did, Kaylie. You did try to seduce me. We both know, if I wanted to seduce you, you'd be seduced. Not much debate about that anymore, is there, Trev? Okay, you know what? I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry for whatever it is that you think I did or, or said. I'm, I'm sorry. You think that's enough for ruining my life? I don't really understand how one minor-league pageant... [grunts] One pageant? My whole life was pageants, Trevor. I had to dress up in slutwear and come on to middle-aged men ever since I was five years old, just so that I can bring home these shiny little trophies so that my mother would love me. Every pageant I entered... I won. Not because I cheated, because I was better. I was smarter, sexier. I deserved to win. I deserved it. And then comes Whittier. And from there, it's a straight shot on to Miss California, then Miss USA, then Miss Universe. That was my future, Trevor. That was my destiny. And you killed that. You single-handedly killed it. All because you thought I was coming on to you? Some basement-dwelling cockroach who only got the gig because mommy was the pageant director and you needed a quick 300 bucks? That pageant meant nothing to you. It meant everything to me. Everything. I never forgot you, Trevor. And then there was that night at Filly's... [upbeat music] [Trevor] It was just a bachelor party. Yes, it was. You were so hammered, you hardly saw me. But I saw you. Yucking it up with your buddies. And that's when I think it really... it really clicked for me. You were happy. Tell your brother to move, Kaylie. No. See, this is where karma steps in. I happen to see your neighbor's name listed in the obits, right? And a little light went off in my head. It's like, "Kaylie Drake, this is it. This is your moment." [intense music] What do you want from me? Just a finger. Something you give up in return for what you took, which was my future... which was... my happiness. You're insane. - Fair's fair, lover boy. - Please. Tell your brother to get out of my way. Bye, Trev. [water splattering] [Trevor grunting] [engine revving] Hey, birthday boy. I got you a little surprise! [Trevor] Oh-oh. I mean, it's not so little and not so much of a surprise, but... I hope you like it. Yeah. Wow. - What's the matter? You okay? - Mm-hmm. You look awful. Are you sick? No, I just, I, I had a little accident is all. - You had an accident? - Mm-hmm. It's stupid, I was, I was just chopping... - Chopping? - Yeah, uh, no. I just, I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing. - It's fine. - Come on, show me. - It looks so much worse... - Come on. Let me see. [gasps] Oh, my God. - It's fine. It's not that bad. - Come on. - No. - It-it, it is decidedly bad. Come on. We need to get you to the hospital. I don't, I don't want to go to the hospital. - We're going. Come on, let's go. - I said no! I'm so sorry. I just... [clears throat] If it doesn't stop bleeding in, like, an hour, I'll go. I promise. Okay. [mellow music] Oh. - Mm... -[Trevor groans] Somebody has an owie. Okay. So that's it. All this, it's-it's over. Well, I mean, let's not get ahead of ourselves. What is that supposed to mean? I'm just saying, what you did, it was a sacrifice and all, but not as big a sacrifice as I thought you were making. I mean, you could've at least told me instead of me having to find out from Ray. [stammers] Told you what? I-I did exactly what you said. - Look in the damn envelope. - Oh, I know you did. But that's... [chuckles] that's not the point, Trevor. The point is, you aren't really gonna suffer much for this. Are you? Mm. Not much at all when you think about it. Not like I have for all these years. That's for sure. Django Reinhardt, Jerry Garcia, that dude from Black Sabbath... What do all those guys have in common, hm, besides being epic guitarists? We had an understanding. Well, apparently, we only had a partial understanding, Trevor. You tricked me. How was I supposed to know you can still be a guitar god with missing fingers? Fair's fair, sweetie. But don't worry, I will think of something to even things out. You're not gonna do anything... because I'm not gonna let you. Well, okay, then. Guess I'll just have to start thinking outside my box. [crickets chirping] [Trevor] Listen, I just, I felt trapped and I didn't see another way out. Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how you sound to a rational person? Yeah, I do. I just, I-I panicked, so... I mean, to-to take a knife... It wasn't a knife, it was bolt cutters. - I, I used bolt cutters. - God! I couldn't lose you. I know this is gonna sound horrible, but... I'm kind of relieved. At least I don't have to wonder anymore. - About Kaylie? - Not just about Kaylie. It's been going on a lot longer than Kaylie. Something changed with us after Clio was born. I mean, I don't know if it was... parenthood or work or continental drift. I just think every relationship has growing pains. No. It was more than that. I honestly thought you were gonna leave me. I would never leave you. Well, I see that now. [both laughing] Uh, yeah, I mean... Maybe I should've done this a long time ago. I need you to know something. If this is about John, I really don't wanna hear it. Great. How long has that been going on? A couple of months. It was just once. I don't, I don't know if I was trying to hurt you... or hurt myself. I just needed to feel something. Anything. But afterward, I just felt empty. And that was it. The next day I told him it was a big mistake and it would never happen again. So all those late-nights were... Because he wasn't there. It was the only time I could be alone. And still, he had his way with me. He's taken all my designs and doesn't give me credit for anything. I mean, I guess that's my punishment for taking what was going to be a promising affair and turning it into a lousy one-night stand. - You could've quit. - Could I? Yeah, you could've gone to another firm. With what? I don't have a portfolio. I don't have my name on anything. The second I put myself out there, he's gonna tear me down so fast that no one would hire me. Hey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. Me, too. [intense music] [birds chirping] [man] What do you do? [Trevor] Musician, mostly. But that's not gonna be happening anytime soon. So I figured I'd get off the couch, make myself useful. So you don't have any real construction experience? Ah, I worked with Habitat For Humanity after college for a little bit. Yeah? How'd that go? Pay sucked. [chuckles] Yeah. Well, look, I've just got general labor stuff. Uh, unloading, cleaning up. - I can start you at 17 bucks. - Yeah, that'd be great. I just, I need to be done in time to get my daughter after she's off school, if that's okay. Yeah. - Sign here and here. - Yeah. So you're good with power tools, huh? [chuckles] Long story. So I'm thinking of going back to school. Maybe take the NCARB exam this fall. That's amazing. Wow, our own board-certified architect in the house. Well, I still have to pass the exam. They say it's even harder than the bar. You'll nail it. I have no doubt. Well, that's one of us. Well, for what it's worth, and trust me, it's not worth much, your husband got a job today. [Renee] What? That's great! Well, tell us about it. Uh, it's construction. Entry-level. But it should count towards my union days. And, and who knows? Maybe one day I will even build one of those fancy houses you design. Well, what do you think about that? Your dad and I building a home for some lucky family like ours. [eerie music] [Trevor panting] [Renee] What's wrong, honey? I hate parsnip. [Trevor clears throat] Am I ever going to see Kaylie again? [Renee] I don't know. Not right now. [Clio] Why not? She's not a good person, kiddo. Because she made you cut off your finger? Finish your stew. [Trevor] What else has she told her? - That-that lying, manipulative... - Trevor... She's not gonna stop until she turns our daughter against us. - You know that, right? - That's not gonna happen. - Mm... - Clio's a smart girl. We're not gonna let her get brainwashed by some bitter, has-been trash queen. No, no. Do not underestimate her, Renee. I already made that mistake once. I didn't know you use this gym. I know! It's crazy, right? [sighs] Well, since we're here, I think you and I should have a little chat. Argh! My God! Ow! What? Uh, oh, not much. I'm just being stalked is all. What? Well, you're hot. I'd stalk you, too, if I wasn't your brother. She threatened me. Hey, what are you doing? [Ray] Ow! What is this? - Do... - What are you doing? [Kaylie] Ugh... [Ray] Oh, that's... [Ray mumbles] You're supposed to meet with your PO this afternoon. - Remember? - Oh, PO. I don't care. I'll go back to prison. I got friends there. The food's good in prison. They're not your friends, Ray-Ray. What? You have no friends, remember? - I have friends. - I'm all you got. - Yeah. - And you're all I got. We look out for each other. Nobody else does that and nobody ever will. - Mm. - Okay? - Inside prison or out. - Okay. Just keep it together for a few hours. - Yeah. - That's all I ask. Okay. Then I can tell you all about my crappy day. - Can you just don't do that? -[toilet flushes] [engine rumbling] -[Renee grunts] -[Clio chuckles] You know you can tell us anything. Anything at all. - We love you so much. - Love you, too, mommy. Mm... All right. [groans] These bones weren't made for heavy lifting. [groans] Well, where does it hurt? Everywhere. Oh. That feels good. [mellow music] I feel better. So do I. [both chuckling] [dramatic music] [wind howling] - Trevor, Trevor. - Hm? [knocking on door] [knocking on door] [Trevor] Hello? Hello? It's Trevor and Renee. We're just looking for Clio. - Oh, my God! - What? They haven't even unpacked yet. Ray, I'm coming upstairs. Don't do anything crazy. The beds are stripped. They're gone. [music continues] Trevor? [footsteps approaching] - What? -[panting] The box. It's empty. They're all empty. They don't live here. The boxes, the truck... It was all for show. - No, it's not. It's not... - They don't live here. It's not possible. They bought the house. Did they? How do we know that? The house isn't even on the market yet. Oh, my... Oh, my... [sobbing] She was here. Clio was here. [sobbing] They left this so we would know. [sobbing] No! [sobbing] - Hey, it's okay. -[sobbing] It's okay. [indistinct radio chatter] [dog barking in distance] [indistinct radio chatter] What are they doing in the backyard? It's just procedure, ma'am. Are they looking for a body? - Is that what they're doing? - Renee, don't. I wanna know what they're doing. They're looking for anything that might help in the investigation. Buried... in the backyard. [Trevor] Look, I-I spoke to Gary. He's the president of our HOA, and he said that the house is still in probate, and it has been ever since Harold Jenkins, the previous owner died last November. Gary said he just assumed that they were relatives of Harold's or something. [man] Nothing on a Kaylie Drake. [sighs] Try, uh, Kaylie Ann Clevender. It was her name back then in the pageanting days. Did you call in an Amber Alert? Your daughter's information was entered into the NCIC system, but we still need an accurate description of the vehicle. It was yellow. A compact. Can you tell me what kind? I don't know. I... I-I didn't look at it closely. This her? Yeah, that's her. We got ourselves a looker. We got an address. Our girl likes to keep moving. Eleven known places of residence in five states. Always with her brother until he upped and moved to Washington State Pen. Down the hall from the Hillside Strangler. Okay. So then, what do we do? I mean, what's our next move? Just sit tight for now, we'll be in touch the second we know anything. Okay. [woman] Ninety-seven percent of all abducted kids are found alive and well, Mrs. Gustafson. Those are some pretty decent numbers. [indistinct radio chatter] [dramatic music] [Renee] I'm trying to speak to Detective Dobbs. Uh, the other person had... No. No. The other person... The other person... They transferred me to you, so... Hi. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm trying to speak to Detective Dobbs. No, you, you are not putting me... Okay. Yeah, hi. I'm trying to speak to Detective Dobbs. The, the other person had me on hold. No. The other... [mellow music] [music continues] [sniffles] Hey, Clio? [virtual assistant] Yes, Trevor? Tell me about my daughter. What would you like to know, Trevor? I don't know. Um... Tell me what her smile's like. I'm sure it's nice. Where is she? Clio, where is my daughter? Your daughter went to live with Kaylie. She will miss you and Renee very much. How do you know that? Clio made a note. May 13th, 11:42 p.m. Where did they go? I don't have that information, Trevor, but I can play the voice note if you'd like. Yeah. Yeah, play it. [Clio] Kaylie says I'll get to go on fun trips and wear the prettiest clothes ever. You'll both understand because you only want me to be happy. Kaylie says someday soon you'll be really, really proud of me. And then all the sad stuff will go away and you and mommy will never argue again. [Clio] Daddy? Come on, we're gonna be late. [Renee] What do you mean, "No police?" Look, they have this all figured out, and, and whatever it is... [sighs] they're the ones that are in control, so we have to do what they say. But the police are trained for this kind of thing. Baby, the police would need an entire army to storm that theater. Ray needs a bullet. Don't talk that way. Listen to me. I know what he's capable of. This is wrong. This is all wrong. We have to believe that. Otherwise none of this matters. If we do what they say, she stays safe. How do we know that? Because she doesn't wanna hurt Clio. She wants to hurt me. Look, I don't know what you're planning, but this is not the way. This is not how we get our daughter back. There is no other way. This is it. I promise you, I'm gonna get her back. I promise. I'm coming with you. Hey, take a seat. Oh, can you, uh, shut the door? Thanks. [sniffles] Come on, guys. Show's about to start. [Trevor] Where's she? Where's Clio? She's fine. So let's keep it that way. Sit. Good boy. Hey, I think you guys are really gonna dig this. It's gonna be great. [instrumental music] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I am your host, Morris Galinsky. - That's pronounced Gavinsky. -[laughing] [Morris] Is this thing working? All right. Morrie and Kaylie go way back. He's worked, like, all of her pageants. I mean, he's a little gone in the head these days, but he's a great guy, he's the best. [Morris] I've had bigger houses in my life, but a gig is a gig and I will work 'em all. Okay, everybody! Now, you all ready for a great evening? "Our judge tonight will be an accomplished guitarist and past judge of Miss Whittier, 2011, Trevor Gustafson!" Let's hear it for Trevor! Come on, everybody. Stand up there, Trevor. Dude, don't be a dick. Come on. [Morris] Where are you? [Ray] Here he is. He's right here. Hey, you with the musket! - Is that real? - Sure is, Morrie. You talk about a tough crowd, here they come armed already. So without further ado and until we next say adieu, here she is, our loveliest of lovelies! -[Ray] Yeah! - Our one and only... Well, come on, sweetheart. -[Renee] Oh, God! -[Ray applauding] - Yes! Let's, let's bring her on! -[Ray howling] -[Morris] Come on! -[gasps] Well, hello to you. Tell us a little bit about yourself, Clio. I'm seven years old, and I love dancing, chocolate cake and wearing pretty dresses. What have they done to her? They grow up fast, don't they? - Uh! Don't do it. - Trev-Trevor, Trevor, don't. Come on. Sit down. But especially, I love my family and I love my school and friends. [Morris] Maybe you have a message for us all? God gave us so many incredible blessings, but also the responsibility to look after those less fortunate than ourselves. If we could all love one another and look past our differences, we could end hate in our lifetimes. So true. [Morris] That was wonderful, honey! Seven years old and she's already got my vote for president! -[Ray laughing] - Well, here it is. The moment you've all been waiting for! I know I have! [music stops] Kaylie, I stuck around like I promised, but that was worth a hell of a lot more than a C-note. I know. I'm sorry, we can't afford you for longer than that. You've still got it, baby. - Okay. - Thank you so much. Listen, tell your friends about me, love. I will. What a lovely, little, unspoiled beauty. Just like you way back when, remember? Kinda like getting a do-over, isn't it? Trouble is, at the end of the day, she'll be a star and you'll still be you. ♪ Well I'm tired of the way you look at me ♪ ♪ When I speak my mind ♪ I'm tired of the words that you put in my mouth ♪ ♪ Happens all the time ♪ I ain't lookin' for someone to save me ♪ ♪ I ain't waitin' on a flash of light ♪ ♪ I lived too damn long to apologize now ♪ ♪ I just wanna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ Right ♪ Right...

How amazing was that? That was just incredible! Ladies and gentlemen, I can't hear you! Come on, guys, don't make her feel bad. [Kaylie] Come on. Yeah! And now for the highlight of our evening, the crowning of Little Miss Adorable! And it all comes down to our judge. He picks the winner. And his decision, as always, is final. And what does the winner receive, you might ask? Well, our little sweetheart gets an all-expenses paid ten-year apprenticeship with yours truly, expert pageant coach, Kaylie Drake, who usually bills her services out at up to $90 an hour. Of course, you can't get this kind of intensive one-on-one training at home. No, not with all the distractions of friends and family. So should Ms. Gustafson win, her parents won't see her again until her 18th birthday when she qualifies for her first adult pageant. What happens if she doesn't win? Great question, Ray. I would hate to think of the lives that would be ruined, starting with this poor little thing right here. But I'm afraid, this time around, it would be our judge, Mr. Gustafson, who has the most to lose. But I wouldn't worry about that. That's how confident I am in our little starlet. We await the judge's decision. But not too long. This dump rents by the hour. Give her the prize. - Huh? - Give her the prize. - She's the winner. - Hey! [laughing] Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Clio! Yay! [Kaylie] Here you go, sweetie. And, uh... Where is it? [gasps] I present to you Little Miss Adorable, Clio Kaylie Gustafson! Whoo-hoo! [chuckles] [Kaylie applauding] Okay, let's go. Come on. -[Renee] Clio! - Stop. Clio! Now's your chance! Run! [Renee] Clio, run, baby, as fast as you can! Come on, sweetie, everything's gonna be okay. Daddy's just a tidbit emotional. - You can fly, kiddo! - Last chance! [Renee] Trevor... Ah... You got me on a good day. Sit your asses back down. Let's get on with this. Why are you letting her do this? She's my little sis. I'd die for that girl. I probably will one day. So... here's how it's gonna go down. You two are gonna sit there and we're gonna be on our way. So see you in about ten years or so. So long. [Ray whistling] [door opens] Trevor! [Trevor] Clio! Clio, your mom and dad are gonna be so proud of you. You'll do all the things I only dreamed of doing when I was your age. You understand what a big opportunity this is, right? Millions of kids, millions, and only one gets to be crowned Miss America. - All good. - Bueno relleno. [Ray] Why you talking Spanish? [Kaylie] Don't ask questions. [grunting] Come on! My lady. Ray promises next time he's gonna fix us up with a Beemer. Sure thing. I'm gonna put a order in tomorrow. [intense music] You okay, honey? You're sweating. Oh, you must be starving. I know I am. I'm ravenous. Ray, let's stop for a froggy burger and a cookie butter shake, okay? Yeah, we can do that in Bakersfield. Sounds good! Baby, what's wrong? I don't feel well. I-it's okay, it's just nerves. We all get 'em on pageant days. It's completely normal. Okay, Ray, maybe you should pull over. She's gonna be sick. - What? - Baby, it's okay. Shh! She's gonna be sick. Can you pull over? Yeah. [Clio groaning] Come on. No, no, no. Not on me, sweetie. Take it from the queen of bulimia. You'll feel much better after you... Ray! I got it. [Renee] Trevor! [intense music] Excuse me. Coming through. Thank you. Nothing to see here. Thank you. [grunts] -[panting] -[woman] Hey! What's the rush, Flo-Jo? Ah, thank God. Thank you so much, ma'am. Yeah. She's just, uh... [panting] She just gets a bit crazy sometimes. Don't you, sweetheart? - Yeah? - He your daddy? -[Clio] No. - Oh, sure, sunshine. Yeah. -[footsteps approaching] - That's her mommy back there. - It's okay, sweetheart. -[panting] Hi. - Hi. - Uh... I think we might wait for a cop. Oh. No. No. No, that's, that's really not necessary. - Oh, no. Yeah... - Uh, Kaylie, why don't you... No, that's, that's our daughter. Clio. Yeah, the doctors say she's on the spectrum, but, personally, I think she's just headstrong like her mommy. Yeah. -[Kaylie] Um... - It's a happy family. - Yeah. - I just wanna be sure is all. - Thank you so, so much. - Yeah, we appreciate that. I just know if it was my daughter, I just... Ow! Oh, my God! [intense music] Trevor. [grunting] I don't know what the law says about killing a defenseless man, but truth is, I don't care. You stole my daughter. Okay. Okay. That... Yes, that was bad, but you can have her back, right? That was always the plan. Sooner or later... Not so fast, Miss Thing. [groans] [grunting] If you're gonna do it, do it right. [Ray] Where you going? Come on. Come on, man. Hey. I'm sorry, daddy. I'm sorry, too, kiddo. [sobbing] [siren wailing] [indistinct radio chatter] [Kaylie] I don't even care what happens to me. I just wanted to help that poor little girl. If only you saw what her life was like, it just... broke my heart. And to think what's gonna happen now... what would become of her hopes and dreams... it just hurts so much. [sobbing] See what I did there? I brought you into my world. I made it real. That, gentlemen, is acting. When I get out, I'm gonna be an actress. You may not know this, but I've done the whole beauty-pageant thing since I was five. Do you know how many former beauty queens become A-list stars? A lot. Vanessa, Michelle, Halle, Oprah, Sharon... It's like a natural transition. And the beauty, the real beauty of it is... when it comes to acting... the crazier, the better.
