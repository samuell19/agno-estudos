Hey, you hombres! Shove them pesky critters along! [ Man Shouting ] [ Cattle Lowing ] We better not shove 'em too fast, Hank. I'm drier than a desert rat's boots. [ Chuckles ] Say, Dusty, there oughta be a water hole around here somewheres. It's been 50 miles since we passed the last one. Yeah, and by the way them cows are losin' weight, we won't get peanuts for 'em by the time we hit Abilene. How much do you reckon they're worth on the hoof, Dusty? Oh, I imagine about eight dollars a head. Well, that's better than bein' broke, the way we are now. Hey, Dusty, take a look at old Oswald. Say, he smells water.You really think so? Sure, he does! He's the smartest lead steer you ever saw. Got a nose like a bloodhound. I'll scout on ahead and see if I can locate the water. You boys bed 'em down here till I get back. All right. [ Cattle Lowing ] Your eyesight ain't good, mister. I'll read that sign for ya. Means just what it says. I don't believe in signs when they read like that one. No one has the right to fence off water on open range. Yeah? Well, I'm Ed Phillips, foreman of this outfit, and I'll back up that-- Open this gate and take me to Mr. Turner. You don't need to go through this gate to see Mr. Turner. The ranch house is up the road. All right. Get mounted and lead the way. You said you wanted to see Mr .Turner. There he is. My regards to you, ma'am. I'm Dusty Gardner, from down Pecos way. I've got a bunch of steers out on the Chisholm Trail that need water. You've come to the right place, Mr. Gardner. We charge five dollars a head, in advance. Five dollars? But that's a little short of highway robbery. Water for trail herds should be free. Oh, the water's free, all right. But this is private property. The toll charge is for using my road. You know as well as I do, ma'am, that we cattlemen can't afford to pay that price for watering our stock. We've been on the trail for weeks, and we're all practically broke. If the cattlemen who drive their herds over the Chisholm Trail don't want to pay my price, there's no law to force them to. Maybe the law will have something to say about... whether or not you can fence off free water. Well, I know a good attorney in Gunsight you can consult, if you want to. Of course, he doesn't hand out advice for nothing. Any lawyer you know wouldn't. I don't like your inference, mister. Ed, show him to his horse. You heard what the boss said, cowpoke. Shake the dust of this ranch off your heels. You do all right, Dusty. Better hire yourself a bodyguard, Ed. You need it. How about coming into the house with me for a little drink? Maybe we can get together, on the water situation. I thought you ordered me off this place. I can change my mind, can't I? Yes, ma'am. I reckon you can. But my cattle need a drink more than I do. Maybe you'd better drive your herd on to Abilene by way of Lost River. That looks like the trail I'll have to take.

You're gettin' mighty independent, ain't ya? Since that tinhorn gambler Montana come along, you ain't had time... to say hello to me and the rest of the boys. Joe, stop it!Excuse me, gentlemen. Joe, stop it. You're hurting my arm. Joe, stop! You been comin' here long enough to know that you made the wrong play, Joe. Get on your horse and start movin'! Howdy do, ma'am? I'm Dusty Gardner from the Pecos country. Well, I'm Mary Lee. I'm owner of the trading post. Oh, and this is Montana Smith. He runs the place for me. Howdy do, Montana?Howdy. Judging from the way that hombre came flying out the front door, I'm wonderin' if a strange cowpuncher is welcome in these parts. Cattlemen are always welcome, as long as they behave themselves. That Joe Rankin is just like the woman he works for. Thinks he can do whatever he wants and no one will interfere. You must mean Belle Turner.I do. If you've met her, you must be with one of the trail herds. That's right, ma'am. Several ranchers and myself are driving stock over the Chisholm Trail. Right now they're bedded down a few miles out. I'm scouting ahead for water. I'm afraid you won't find any water around here, my friend. We haul ours all the way from the public well at Gunsight. [ Sighs ] Belle Turner really must have a sense of humor. She advised that I trail through to Kansas by the way of Lost River. The name apparently means what it says. It certainly does. My father bought this place from Belle Turner last spring. There was a river running by it then. But with the hot weather, the river dried up... and just seemed to disappear into nowhere. Oh, I've tried to keep the place open, but it's hopeless. Another few months, and the cattlemen won't even come over the Chisholm Trail anymore. I'm afraid you're drawing from a cold deck, my friend, unless you deal with Belle Turner. She controls the only water within 80 mile of here. That really is serious. My stock is in bad shape now without attempting to drive that far. Belle Turner has no right to cut off water from the Chisholm Trail, and I intend to prove it. I'm going into Gunsight and take out an injunction against her. I wish you luck. Montana and I are starting for town after water in a while, Mr. Gardner. If you'd like to, you can come along with us.Thanks. I'd be pleased to.

Thank you.I'll be back just as soon as I talk to the sheriff. All right. Hey, Alvin! Well, bless my soul! Dusty! [ Chuckling ] Well, well. Hey, odds bodkins! If it ain't my old trail-herdin' pal Gardner. How are you, old fakir? Hello, Jimmy. Hi, Dusty. How are Johnny and Scotty and the other boys? Fine! They're all with me yet.That's wonderful. When did you stop training lead steers and go into the show business? And where did you get that name "Polario"?Shh! Tsk, tsk, tsk. I buried the name "Alvin Pendergast" along with my animal past. I am now using my hypnotic powers on men. [ Chuckles ] What are you doing in these parts? I'm taking the trail herd to Abilene, and I sure wish you were with me. Every time I look at old Oswald, I think of you. Oswald? Don't tell me you're gonna sell Oswald, Dusty. Not that steer. He tells us when there's water around, even if we can't reach it. I hope the show business is paying better than the cattle business. Why, we're doing terrific, me and Jimmy.Oh, that's fine. Yes, sir! I'm just jingling with gold.[ Grunts ] Uh, j-- j-- jingling with gold. If white man got money that jingle jangle, then white man tell Indian lie. Indian wantum money back. Now lookee here, "Rain in the Face." Indian give white man push in face no getum money back. D-d-d-d-d-- Now lookee h-- I, uh-- uh-- Uh, Hopping Crow? Well, that's a very p-p-p-pretty name, Hopping Crow. Mmm.Good luck, Polario. I've got to go see the sheriff. The sheriff? Say, I've gotta go see the sheriff myself. As a matter of fact, he's attached to me, or I'm attached to him. There is an attachment!Yeah, on the tent. Yeah, on the tent.Yeah. Now lookee here. Doggone it, you'll get paid. Oh, hop along, Crow! Why, if it isn't Mr. Gardner. You weren't looking for the sheriff by any chance, were you? Not by chance, Miss Turner. Well, let me introduce you. Sheriff Beadly, this is my friend, Dusty Gardner. Glad to know you.Howdy do. Belle's been telling me your troubles. I don't doubt it. I suppose you know she's taken up all the land around Little Lake. - Everybody knows that. - But the lake is on government range. Now I want a court order forcing her... to let the trail herd drive through her property to water. I'm afraid I can't help you, Gardner. There's no government ruling come through my office... covering this kind of situation. In that case, I guess I'd better use my own judgment. What about my tent, Sheriff? It'll come down if you don't pay up. That's what I thought. If you keep that water fenced off, Belle, the cattlemen will stop coming here and the town will go broke. Why don't you work out some kind of a compromise with them, hmm? There may be something in what you say, Sheriff. I'll take care of this pumping, Mary. Thanks, Dusty. Oh, Polario and Jimmy. This is Miss Mary Lee and Montana. How do you do?Howdy. Howdy. Oh, Dusty. I've been thinking over what you just said, and maybe I have been a little unreasonable in my dealings with the cattlemen. "Unreasonable" is hardly the word, Belle. I didn't come over here to start an argument. I was in hopes that perhaps we could all get together and settle our difficulties. [ Dusty ] It's agreeable with me. Why the sudden change of heart, Belle? What are you up to now? Nothing that concerns you, Montana. Whatever happens to Mary concerns me. I aim to see that she gets a fair deal. That's bighearted of you, I'm sure. Dusty, bring the other cattlemen who are with your trail drive... over to the trading post tonight. I'll meet you there with my foreman.Thanks. Boy, would I like to hypnotize her. [ Wolf Whistles ] You better hypnotize somebody mighty quick, or we don't eat.

Her racket's paying off too well for her to suddenly change. I reckon you're wrong, Montana. Good evening, Mary. So sorry I'm late. That's all right, Belle. Oh, what a beautiful dress. Oh, it's just an inexpensive gown I picked up last winter down in New Orleans. I always go there during the bad weather. I'll be glad to do a little shopping for you on my next trip if you like. Of course, something a little more simple than this might suit you better, because you're such a plain type. So nice to see you again, Dusty.Thank you. The pleasure's all mine. Let's get down to business, Belle. These men here, they don't like to stay away from their herd too long. Yes, ma'am. Cattle are mighty restless when they're thirsty, ma'am. That's right. I guess we should get this discussion over with as quickly as possible. Oh, Ed. I left my handbag outside in the rig. Get it for me. Yeah, let's hurry this thing up. I'm kind of worried about Oswald. Ed just gave us the go sign. Let's stampede the herd. [ Lowing ] [ Gunshots ] [ Bellowing ] [ Men Shouting ] [ Gunshots Continue ] I'm only reducing the toll charge as a friendly gesture, Mr. Randall. I don't have to, you know. But 50 cents a head ain't no reduction, ma'am. Somebody stampeded the cattle!What's that? I tried to stop them, but it was no use.Who stampeded 'em? A gang of riders charged down one of the hills and started shootin'. As soon as the herd was on the run, they lit out. I'm awfully sorry, Dusty. I suppose they headed straight for water.You said it. They busted right through the Turner fence and didn't stop until they reached the lake. I thought you were dealing from the bottom of the deck. You planned this thing from the start, Belle, so that Dusty and the cattlemen would be here while your men rustled their herds. You're what I always thought you were-- a no-good scheming-- Let-- Let go of me! Let go of me! Get-- Get your hands off of me! To get your cattle, you'll have to drive them back across my property. Not a head goes through until you and your friends pay the toll charge in advance. Mister, I'll figure out how many cattle you have... and bring you your bill the first thing in the morning. [ Polario ] Well, that looks like Oswald is a prisoner. Dusty, you gotta do something to rescue Oswald. I'm for goin' over to that Turner ranch and taking our cattle, at the point of a gun, if necessary. Only fools draw against odds.Montana's right. Why not leave our cattle there to fatten up a bit... while we figure a way out of our trouble. Well, I reckon maybe you are talking horse sense. I'm sorry this had to happen while you were all in my place. That's all right, Mary. It wasn't your fault. And besides, I kinda like it here. Me too. That fight kinda made me a little thirsty. [ Chuckling ] Uh-oh. Yeah. Hey, get that Indian off my neck, will you? Vamoose! [ Men Chuckling ] What'd you say?I said, "Vamoose!" Say, it worked. [ Men Laughing ] "Vamoose." [ Laughing ] Vamoose. I'm gonna saddle up and go over and hypnotize that she-wolf Belle Turner. I'm gonna walk old Oswald off right under her nose. She ain't gonna make rump roast outta my friend. Hey. Maybe you won't have to go after all. Here come a couple of her men right now. I'm gonna tell 'em off plenty, the scurvy mugumps. They're the ones what "stoled" Oswald. You wore out your welcome last night, Ed. Now you and Joe climb back on your horses and get out of here. I'm here to give them trail herders their bill. Don't stick out your bill around here. You're liable to get it shot off. We ain't gonna be robbed, and you ain't allowed to hold Oswald a prisoner either. Doggone it! [ Grunting ] Whoa! Ha-ha! Oh! Get goin'.All right. But I'm leaving this souvenir. [ Dusty ] What's happened? What's the matter?By the great Caesar's ghost, there's a gopher down there, and he's gargling! [ All Laughing ]He must have a sore throat. "Sore throat." He's still doin' it. Listen, Dusty. Well, ain't you gonna listen?[ Laughs ] I've never heard a gopher gargle before, but I reckon there's a first time to everything. Now you wait.All right. I'm waiting. [ Faint Rumbling ] Sounds like running water. It is water! Away down deep. You see what happens when you keep your ear to the ground? It must be the Lost River running through an underground channel. If it is, we'll drill a well. It's a waste of time attemptin' to sink a well here. Other folks have tried and failed. And don't forget it takes money.You shouldn't talk like that. You know I can't hold on to the trading post... unless the cattlemen keep using the Chisholm Trail. I'll find a well driller who'll take our cattle for security. Yeah. And if we don't strike water, we'll lose 'em. You'll lose 'em anyway, Hank, unless you pay off Belle Turner. The law will back her up.Mary's right. I have a hunch the main body of water runs underground right here, and I'm willing to risk my cattle to find out. I'm with you, Dusty. I'll throw in my herd. Well, you can count me in.That's the way to talk. I sure wish I hadn't heard that garglin' gopher. If we don't bring in a well, them butchers'll make pot roast outta Oswald. Aw, we can't lose. Is there a well driller in town? Yes, Bert Hanson.Good. Get your horses. We're going into Gunsight. Dusty Gardner and the other trail drivers... just signed a contract with Bert Hanson... to drill for an artesian well in the dry wash near the trading post. If they strike water, you'll be outta luck. Your tollgate won't be worth a plug nickel. They're not going to strike water. The drilling equipment is being moved out of town right now. Get ahold of Mike Carey and the other boys. We've got to stop it. [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshots Continue ] He's pretty badly wounded. We've gotta get him to the doctor quickly.I'll take him back to town. You boys go ahead with the wagon.Good. I told you to stop that equipment, Ed. We did the best we could, Belle, without gettin' shot up ourselves. Looked like Bert Hanson got plugged, ma'am. I don't think you have to worry about a well going down. Well, just to make sure there's no slipup, Mike, you better ride on over to the trading post. You know something about well drilling, and maybe you can get a job. I got you. I know enough to keep a well from working. There ain't no use of us bulldoggin' this thing around any longer, Dusty. Don't any of us seem to know how to make it work. I hate to admit you're right, Hank, but this equipment is not gonna do us a bit of good unless we get an expert driller. My grandfather taught me how to put these machines together, and I can't understand why it won't work. You can't tell me Belle Turner didn't have... something to do with the attack on our wagon. How is Bert Hanson, Montana?The doc says he'll pull through, but I'm afraid it'll be too late to do us any good. Well, I'm ready to call it quits right now-- Go on to Abilene and sell my cattle. After I pay Belle Turner off, I'll at least have enough money to get back home on. I never thought you were a quitter, Hank. Now we'll get this equipment working, You're optimistic, Dusty, but I'm afraid you're drawing a losing hand. [ Hooves Clopping ] Hiya, folks. Howdy, ma'am. My name's Mike Carey. Heard you were trying for a well. Thought I might get a job.Partner, if you know anything about well drilling equipment, you've got a job.I've been drilling wells all my life. Let me shake your hand, friend. You're sure an answer to a thirsty cow's prayer. Let me introduce myself. I'm Alvin J. Pendergast Polario, the great hypnotist. This is Mary Lee, Montana Smith-- Howdy.Dusty Gardner, Hank Randall and the boys. Find any goldfish yet?No, but we got a bite. [ Laughing ] Say, where's Montana? I ain't seen him around. He's in town. Say, what's gotten into him lately? He doesn't seem the same. Oh, he'll be all right as soon as the well comes in.Oh, does it look that good? Yeah. Ought to be coming in pretty soon now. Isn't that right, Mike? Can't tell anything about this type of well. You either get a gusher or nothing at all. We've been working two weeks now... and ain't hit wet sand yet. Your deal with Hanson was for 15 days. If you don't strike water by day after tomorrow, you and your friends are gonna lose their cattle.Oh, don't you worry, Mary. I've learned enough about well drilling in the last few days... to know that we're gonna strike it pretty soon now. [ Chuckles ] What's the matter Mike? Can't you sleep? No. I thought I'd have a cup of coffee. Good. I'm glad you came. Who was it, Dusty?It was Mike Carey. Well, what was he battling you for? I don't know, unless he wanted to wreck the well drilling equipment. Well, I'm certainly glad you're not hurt.Polario, put on your clothes... and stand guard here for a while. I'm going in after Hank and the boys. From now on, we're going to be ready for plenty of trouble. You said it.

Oh, I've been in town.Well, I've missed you. I've missed you too, Mary. I was wonderin' what you'd do if the well didn't come in. Oh, I don't know. I guess I'd stay here. That is, until there were no more riders on the Chisholm Trail. Then what?Who knows? Well, let's not talk about that now. Saw Belle on my way back here tonight. She told me she'd bought out Hanson. Gonna take over all his contracts. Then the well has to come in, Montana. If it does, Dusty can borrow enough money to take care of everything. I'll go and tell him. [ Door Closes ] [ Snoring ] A watched pot never boils, eh? "Agadabba. Cuzzaba." Boily, potty, boily. [ Grunts ] Where'd you come from?Me wantum money back. I know how to get rid of you. Moose, Crow, moose. Didn't you hear me tell ya? Moose, Crow, moose. [ Yelling ] Don't! Don't hurt me! [ Yells ] [ Polario Babbling ] Well, I reckon that finishes us, Dusty. Can't drill no well without an engine. How I'd like to get my hands on the hombre that busted it. Talkin' about what we'd like to do is no good. We've got to get another engine and get it quick. Say, Hanson's got another engine. [ Jimmy ] Yeah, but Belle Turner bought him out. [ Polario ] That's right. She wouldn't give us the rust off a left-handed monkey wrench. Say, has anybody seen Montana this morning? Well, surely you don't think he has anything to do with this. I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Hank, you and the boys move the engine from the derrick. Polario and I are going into town and see if we can pick up another one. I saw what you picked up over there.You don't miss a thing, do you? Not when there's as much at stake as we got. I wonder why Montana would do a thing like that. That's what I aim to find out. Howdy. You hombres seem to be in a hurry.We are. Somebody wrecked our engine last night. Oh. Sorry. I guess you'll be able to find another one in town. Is this what you're looking for? Yeah. Where'd you find it? Where you lost it last night when you wrecked our engine. I should bend a gun barrel over your head instead of using my fists. You thought you were hurting me when you smashed that engine, didn't you? Yeah, I suppose I did. [ Grunts ] I wanted you to leave town. I thought if the well didn't come in, you'd have to leave. I think I understand, Montana. But don't you realize, I wasn't just thinkin' of myself or you or Mary... when I wanted to drill that well? I was thinkin' of all the other cattlemen... who drive their herds through this part of Texas. Why, it won't be long before there'll be large cities and railroads here, and the cattle trails will all be gone. But until that day comes, I'm going to do all I can... to see that the trail herds get through to market, and the cattlemen are protected. I didn't think of it that way, Dusty. I guess I got what was comin' to me. Being sorry isn't enough. I've got to get another engine and finish that well by tomorrow, or Belle Turner will step in and take over everything. And you can't buy an engine without money. I know where there's an engine. And I know where you can get your hands on a little cash, I think. You wouldn't mind double-crossing Belle to do it, would you? Hardly. That's the only kind of dealing she understands. Come on.Just a minute, Montana. This had better be on the level. It doesn't look like anybody's around. Uh-oh. Here comes Cleopatra and her trained snake. Good morning, Miss Turner. Howdy, ma'am.Good morning, gentlemen. Kind of early for you to be leaving the trading post, isn't it, Dusty? Yes, and I'm planning on pulling out for good.That's interesting. What's happened to change your mind? Someone wrecked the well drilling engine last night, and there's no way of getting another... now that you're in control of the Hanson Company. You're getting smarter every day, aren't you? Go ahead, rub it in. I know when I'm whipped, and I'm willing to make you a proposition. I'm listening. According to your figures, I owe you five dollars a head toll charge on my cattle. Uh-uh. Four-fifty. Don't forget I reduced the rates. [ Chuckling ] That's right. Now I'm willing to pay you off in cattle, on the condition... that you buy 50 or 60 more head from me at the regular market prices. Now that'll give me enough money to complete my drive on to Abilene. Then what?Well, after that... I guess I'll head back to the Pecos country again. You know, it wouldn't do any harm for you to get away... from Lost River for a while, Dusty.Yeah? If I accept your offer, when will you start? Just as soon as the rest of my cattle are on the trail again. It's a deal. You, um, might drop in to visit me on your way back. By that time, things will have cleared up around here. I might see you sooner than you expect, Belle. Ed, get the boys and cut out Gardner's herd. I'll tell you how many to keep and how many to let go through the gate. Hey, Dusty. What about Oswald? Who's Oswald?The professor's pet steer. He trained him to do tricks, and he doesn't want to lose him. Why, yeah. He's even got more sense than I have.I don't doubt it. I guess you can have him. [ Chuckles ] [ Lowing ] [ Cowboys Shouting, Whistling ] I ain't gonna wait any longer for Dusty. Besides, he's been gone all day. We've been fools in the first place... for puttin' up our herds for security.He'll be back, Hank. And he'll have the engines with him. Yeah, and even if he does, we won't have time to finish drillin' the well... by tomorrow night, and that's the deadline.[ Hooves Clopping ] This is sure a cheerful-looking outfit. You're not waiting for Dusty Gardner, are you? What do you mean, Belle? Why shouldn't we?Won't do you any good. He took what was left of his cattle after paying me off, and pulled out for Abilene. I don't believe you.Suit yourself. You'll find out I'm telling the truth. [ Wagon Approaching ] Does that look as if he's run out on us? [ Man ] Say, here comes Dusty. I knew he wouldn't let us down. Hiya, boys. Hi, boys!Did you get that engine? Take a good look, Belle. Fine-lookin' engine, huh? [ Laughs ] You double-crosser. You said you were leaving the country. [ Chuckles ] I didn't say I'd stay. [ Laughs ] He told you he'd be back sooner than you expected, remember? You're really clever, aren't you? Selling me part of your cattle so you could buy another engine. Well, it wasn't a bad idea.Maybe you'll think different before I'm through with you. Remember this-- I bought that well drilling equipment, and according to Hanson's contract, you're to be through with it by 4:00 tomorrow afternoon. I'll be here at that time, and I'll have plenty of help. [ Hooves Clopping ]All right, boys. We haven't even got a chance.Listen to me a minute. Dusty here sold most of his cattle to keep the well drillin' going. Now if you don't fly into the job now and back him up, somebody ought to take you out and knock your heads together. Come on, now. Let's get this engine unloaded. [ Polario ] Let's go, boys.[ Chattering ] [ Engine Running ] All right, shut her off. [ Engine Stops ] Say, it looks like we're down to water gravel. Well, we'd better hit water pretty pronto, or it's gonna be just too bad. It's after 3:00 now, and Belle Turner wasn't foolin'... when she left here yesterday. I heard Mike say something about shooting a well in. Suppose we could do it?What's that? Exploding a charge of dynamite down the well. The concussion sometimes breaks up the rock formation. Lets the water through. How come you know so much about well drillin' all of a sudden, Montana? You never offered to help us before. I went to school yesterday, Hank. Had a few lessons pounded into me... by a right good teacher. Thanks, partner, for what you're doing. Forget it. Say, where's Polario? Search me. He left this morning right after breakfast. You can bet your last dime that whatever he's doing, he's doing it for us. Now Belle Turner's liable to be here any moment now to take over, so you boys get your rifles and stand guard. Don't let anybody in the riverbed unless I give you the word. [ Hooves Galloping ] [ Whinnies ] Hello, Oswald. Get up there, Brownie. Hello, Oswald. I'm sure glad to see you. Oh, boy. Come on, Oswald. Here's where you're gonna do your stuff. [ Grunting ] [ Groans ] Doggone it. Ahh. [ Hopping Crow ] Mmm. Me wantum money back. Just a minute, Hopping Crow. Me and you ought to be friends. Me wantum money back. Well, I-- I don't want to shoot you, but if I got to, I got to, I guess. Uh, Hoppin' Crow, can't we talk these things over? No getum money back, me take bull. Just a minute. You can't do that to me. Besides, that's no bull. It's a steer, and it ain't mine. Hmm!Hey! Ahh. Hopping Crow go bye-bye. [ Hisses ] You shut eye. Go to sleep. [ Hisses ] From now on, Hopping Crow, you're a cigar store Indian. [ Hisses ] [ Laughing ] Oh! I hypnotized him. [ Giggles ] Well, for goodness' sake. Lookee here. Here. Give me that pie-cutter. Come on, Oswald. You wanna show me how grateful you are? Go on down to that lake and bring that herd out. Go on! Down to the lake! There you are, Crow. You just stay right there and keep on sleepin'. Every now and then, I'll come and give you some water and feed you. [ Chuckles ] Thanks. Montana, we'll drop this dynamite down the well and try to blow it in. All right, pull up! This is as far as you go. Stand aside. I have business to discuss with Dusty Gardner. I'm sorry, lady, but he ain't in to callers today. Now turn around and get movin'-- All of you. [ Gunshots ] "D-Y-N-A-M"-- Dynamite! What's this? Hey! Wait! I've got dynamite. Don't! [ Groans ] Why, you-- [ Groans ] Dusty! Mary! Everybody clear out! Dynamite in the w-- [ Explosion ] [ Cheering, Whooping ] Take a good look at that, Belle. That's free water.The water won't do you any good. You'll never get your cattle through my place now. No? Then take a look out there. [ Bellowing ] Come on, Oswald! Hey, Hank. You and the boys take Belle and her friends into town. Turn 'em over to the sheriff. All right. Get goin' now. [ Montana ] Take 'em in, Hank. That well of water is worth more than a gold mine in this part of the country, Dusty. It isn't my gold mine. It belongs to the West. Well, lots of luck to you and Mary.Thanks. Where do you think you're going?Me? [ Chuckles ] I'm kinda like a tumbleweed. You never know where I'll drift to. Good-bye, Montana. Do you see what I see? Where do you think you're goin'? Take off my clothes. Now me rock paleface bye-bye. "Abba cadabba." Abba cadabba. No, Hoppin' Crow. Have a heart. Moose. Mmm.
