We are in the presence of a legend with many faces loathed by many, admired deeply by others. Her name is still taboo in Germany. Leni Riefenstahl, the most influential filmmaker of the Third Reich, the last great surviving image maker of the Nazis. A film about Leni Riefenstahl, can content itself with updating the old prejudices. Or it can attempt to deconstruct her myth, and to look at it afresh A feminist pioneer or a woman of evil. One thing is certain, she is still the most famous female film director in the world. This film will approach her without preconceptions. What do you feel, looking at those pictures? Well, really as if the person in this picture is not me... ...but just some actress This innocence, enthusiasm... ...then the fall from fame, the great disappointment... ...how do you see all that today? It's all so long ago now, I've long since got over it I don't think about it anymore At my age... ...I'll be 90 this year... ...many decades have now gone by. They were bad times It's like another world but no longer live in that past Guest Dance Performance An Evening of Dance I really only wanted to go on stage as an experiment To see whether I would make a good dancer But I had such a huge success, I was immediately engaged by Max Reinhardt Then Prague wanted me, and Zurich. It was incredible, intoxicating It was incredible This station here at Nollendorfplatz totally changed my life I was standing here waiting for a train I had to go to the doctor. I had hurt my knee badly and couldn't dance I was impatient because the train was late But, as it drew in, I suddenly saw a poster for a film... ...'Mountain of Destiny' It showed a mountaineer stepping across a chasm I was so fascinated I missed the train I stood rooted to the spot I read: 'Mountain of Destiny' Mozartsaal Cinema, Nollendorfplatz It was right here. I forgot the doctor and everything else... ...and went to the cinema 'Mountain of Destiny' directed by Arnold Fanck was the first feature film in the history of cinema to set its drama high in the mountains. When she saw it, the film was to change Riefenstahl's life. Frank had invented an evocative new genre the mountain film. It was a totally new kind of film The first mountaineering film The first with sequences so filled with movement The clouds were alive with movement. We'd never seen that before Fanck was breaking new ground His use of slow motion, lighting, the composition of his shots... It was all artistic and way ahead of its time I didn't know much about film but realised I was looking... ...at a very special art-form on the screen for the first time Riefenstahl immediately set off in search of Fanck, and quite by chance met his leading actor Luis Trenker in a hotel in the Dolomites She came up and said she wanted to star opposite me in my next film She's crazy, I thought. Then she gave me a lovely photo of herself I sent it to Fanck and wrote: Dear Fanck, this woman is beautiful She's determined to be in your next film, starring opposite me It's all a fantasy... ...but I enclose her photo. Do what you like with it Fanck was smitten, and was so fascinated by her that he asked her to play the starring role in his next film I'd hurt my knee seriously while dancing So I sent Fanck my photos and the rave reviews Presumably because of the pictures and reviews... ..he visited me in hospital To my amazement he handed me a script on which was written: "'The Sacred Mountain' written in 3 days and nights for Leni Riefenstahl" Then Fanck wrote to me: You're the one who's crazy. She'll be Germany's greatest star She's going to be your leading lady so see you get on with her The script said I had to be buried by an avalanche We were quite mad to do it I can show you the spot or as near as makes no difference Up there We stood on a rock-face like that Maybe even steeper I had to cling... ...onto a rock with my hands... ...until the avalanche came down Not just once but two or three times People today say it was madness, but Fanck demanded our all This is where I did my first directing Since the last time we filmed here... ...sixty-six years have gone by I will never forget this scene It wasn't only my first time as director... ...it was the first time I had to wind a camera In those days there were no electric cameras It would all have gone wonderfully but there was an accident The moment I began turning the handle to shoot... ...there was a terrible bang as a torch exploded The boy holding it was behind me. There was a sheet of flame My face was burnt ...but I went on filming I could feel the pain... ...but I finished the shot And when I'd finished I looked in the mirror My face was black Then I heard a little boy had also nearly been burnt... ...but they rescued him In the Berlin of the early 1920s, war profiteers and black market millionaires flaunted their wealth But, for most of the people, life was wretched Many was starving Soup kitchens and food queues were a common sight on the streets Social unrest was rife. Berlin, 60 years later For this film, Leni Riefenstahl and her companion of many years, Horst Kettner visit the legendary UFA Filmstudios in Babelsberg This is where all the classic German silent film were made The camera follows you... ...and you tell us how you first came to the studios - As I'm walking along? - Yes, is that a problem? - I can't speak when I'm walking - Couldn't you walk a bit? No, I've never done that in my life I've never talked while I'm walking I'm not a ghost Just try it I'm just saying I can't talk while I'm walking Even when I dream, I lie down or sit. I can't talk and walk No one told me... You won't listen, will you? I did listen I'll ask you a question roughly like this You'll answer while we pull back slowly But you can't walk backwards. I'd have to speak like this But I'm here How did the studio atmosphere strike you? It was very impressive Three big films were being made here Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', with Brigitte Helm Murnau's 'Faust' with Camilla Horn and our film 'The Sacred Mountain' Admittedly, we were in a small studio But here in this studio, where I later shot scenes for 'Tiefland'... they'd built some fantastic sets They were hundreds of extras Did you meet any famous directors? I never met Lang... ...but Fanck wanted me to go for the part of Gretchen in Murnau's 'Faust' I got hold of a long blonde wig Fanck was convinced Murnau would hire me Muranu was interested I was on the short-list but Camilla was his final choice Leni Riefenstahl never became star tied to the studio From her first film, she was drawn over and over again away from Berlin, into the mountains This was my favorite area There's hardly a rock-face or peak I haven't climbed See how steep it is? To the left of that ridge, there's a sheer drop of over 2,000 ft Wonderful! For these mountain films, the actress from Berlin had to learn to ski and rock climb and quickly became a skilled mountaineer She even climbed without ropes and in bare feet for the cameras In those days, mountain climbing was strenuous activity practiced exclusively by men But Riefenstahl never had any difficulty asserting herself Later on, she would become the only woman to play a significant role in the rise of National Socialism You can only get a general shot of the mountains behind me The camera must be on me... ...or it won't work If you want me to talk about climbing, I must face the rocks... But we're too far away... No, while I'm talking, you can film the rock-face with the telephoto You can edit that in - The mountains will be too small - But we need a general shot Yes, but not like that You must find a cinematic solution The mountains make no impression You can only do it in the cutting, never with a camera-angle Don't tell me you want a Hitler-salute Over there is the famous east face We had to bivouac a rope's length below the summit Way down, I could see lights in the huts below I suppose I didn't realise... It was fascinating because you forgot everything All your worries and problems... you just concentrated on not falling It's a sport... ...which involves the whole body It gives you a feeling of freedom, being so close... ...to the rocks, to nature, and the mountains When you reach the top... ...there's such a feeling of bliss... ...you just want to experience it as often as possible For the best of Arnold Fanck's mountain films, Riefenstahl persuaded the director to hire the famous stunt-flier Udet And to bring in his co-director, one of the great names in German Cinema, W.G. Pabst Yes, Fanck was so wonderful outdoor director for filming nature Pabst was a fabulous feature-film director I brought the two together and it worked wonderfully That's the reason why 'Pizpalü' was such a success worldwide These shots are from a home movie, filmed by a member of the crew on Morteratsch Glacier in St. Moritz When Pabst told me to look right... ...I looked left. When he said left, I looked right So he said, "You're not the director. Stop looking from the camera's angle" He was the first to make me see.. ...I'd a talent for directing An entire rock-face was iced over to create the illusion that the glacier had moved into the valley Working with Fanck was always a mental and a physical challenge We were on an ice-wall in 'Pizpalü' It was minus 28 degrees The Engadine hadn't been so cold for 50 years We were working at night and the wind-machine blew snow in my face - He might lose consciousness - Tie hum tight or he'll fall Pabst was quite different from Fanck Fanck gave very few directions. We had to more or less improvise But Pabst knew exactly what he wanted Without acting out the part for us, he put the actor... ...in the mental state he wanted, which is very important You forgot the camera and became the character you were portraying Maria, the rope! While filming with Arnold Fanck, Riefenstahl and Luis Trenker were themselves learning how to direct Fanck was a perfectionist, a stickler for details Even when his actors were being tested to the limit Oh, I'd rather not think about that It wasn't just bad, it was awful Fanck's plan was to have me hauled up and let an avalanche drop on me I said, "Count me out. It's out of the question" So he said, "Leni darling, it won't be a real avalanche" "We'll just drop a bit of snow on you" He was very persuasive and promised extra money I agreed and was tied up with rope The camera crew were up above, and off we went I'd only gone 10 feet... ...when a real avalanche enveloped me I screamed, my ears and eyes hurt Fanck kept the camera rolling on and on Then they pulled me in For weeks I was black and blue all over. I really hated Fanck In 1920s Berlin, the National Socialists were parading through the streets And the young fanatic named Goebbels was gaining notoriety with his inflammatory speeches As the struggle for power raged between the rival parties the Babelsberg studios decided to try and take on Hollywood In the studio, now named Marlene Dietrich Hall Riefenstahl furthered her education when she met Josef von Sternberg Von Sternberg brought me to the studio every day... ...until it got too much for Marlene I liked her a lot, I idolised her. She was exceptional but very jealous One day we had quite a row in the studio, She started it There was this famous scene where she sits on a barrel... ...and sings 'Falling in Love Again' She starting behaving very crudely... ...to try and make me leave in disgust Sternberg noticed and stepped in... ...but she said she'd leave the film if I came to the studio again He said to me, "Leni, you're the complete opposite of Marlene "You're both very special but quite different "I've shaped Marlene... "...into this wonderful creation... "...and I'll do the same for you "You haven't been discovered yet" I really regret the fact that, when he offered me work in Hollywood... ...I was unable to go I was deeply involved with a man at the time... ...and didn't want to leave him I have that to thank... ...or to regret for my not going to Hollywood When Von Sternberg later saw Riefenstahl's own first film, he was able to make a more precise judgment about her Yes, he'd seen me in 'The Blue Light'... ...where I played the role of Junta... ...an innocent, naive child of nature... ...who is intentionally asexual... ...whereas Marlene was the sexy type, erotic, a sort of sphinx... ...a star, an elegant super-star He thought I was the absolute opposite of Marlene I think that was probably true While Riefenstahl made films for Hitler, Dietrich chose to emigrate In his memoirs, Von Sternberg makes no reference to Riefenstahl In the streets of Berlin, Nazis were still struggling to win elections Hitler, waiting in the wings was certainly ready, but, was Germany? We Germans wanted a Führer... ...and we got one, right? We Germans are all like that, we want a Führer And what happens? This ghastly Hitler comes along... ...and everyone says, "Wonderful, here's a real Führer "Someone to tell us what to do" There's something in what Marlene says For us, at school and at home... ...discipline came first. She's right there Germans would be very enamored of someone... ...they thought they could model themselves on They're happy to let themselves be led, that's for sure While the Germans rallied around their new Führer in ever increasing numbers, Riefenstahl set off again for the mountains In the south Tirol, she made her first film a romantic fairy-tale, which she produced, directed and starred This rocky peak in the Brenta Massif of the south Tirol is transformed by Leni Riefenstahl's camera into a mysterious presence mythical and Wagnerian The girl holding the crystal is an outcast, a witch The crystal or crystals... ...are in fact the symbolic theme of 'The Blue Light' Junta... ...who is a wild, innocent mountain girl... ...was fascinated by the light in this grotto In the mountains was a crystal grotto which only Junta knew about It was only visible... ...by the blue light of a full moon shining through a crack Then it was a shimmer of blue Symbolic... ...of the ideal one always dreams of but never attains That's the film's theme Why did you choose a fairy-tale for your first film? I suppose because Dr. Fanck's films... ...although realistic, were set in fairy-tale landscapes I found that a conflict of styles Fairy-tale landscapes and realistic action didn't work together for me But since I also loved beautiful, fairy-tale, picturesque landscape... ...I thought it would be better to fit a fairy-story into it No one in the film understands how power of a mysterious mountain had access to the precious stones You witch Go away, you ugly old witch How beautiful Before I worked with Fanck, when I was a dancer... ...I'd written scripts but no screenplays Then I met Carl Mayer, the famous playwright... ...who'd written the material for Murnau's film... ...and Bela Balazs, who was the best screen-writer then They liked my material so much they gave me some good tips Balazs even helped me for free Balazs wrote the dialogue and I did the visual scenes It was the ideal collaboration Here, for instance... ...I drew the waterfall and the position of the sun It says here, 7:10 a.m. Shooting must be finished by 8 I even put the lens to be used: a 7.5 focal length It's all noted You put down every scene in writing I fine-tuned every scene through the camera, worked out the light... ...and tested everything in advance. It ran like clockwork We even did a rush of every scene We made a negative to see whether we could improve on it We placed a lot of importance on picture quality Riefenstahl was a perfectionist, and would only settle for the best For her first film, she ordered a special lens to be sent over from Hollywood and asked the labs to develop a new film stock for the night scenes I was able to do that because Agfa made some special film-stock for me It was later called R-Stock If you use it with a red filter, the blue comes out dark, almost black I could do climbing shots as if they were at night, without a spotlight It was an experiment As Rosselini and De Sica told me, I was the first... ...to film in real locations, like a church We built nothing in the studio I was given permission to film in a church... ...while the priests were conducting a service The inn scenes were filmed in Bolzano In fact all the interior scenes... ...were shot in real locations for the first time in a feature film When the film was ready, I showed it to Agfa, who were the distributors They didn't like it at all and I was also disappointed with it The film did not look as I'd envisaged it So I went and showed it to Fanck And he said, "Come back tomorrow and we'll improve it "It has weaknesses and boring bits" When I went back the next day... ...he'd cut up my copy into hundreds of pieces and completely re-edited it I was horrified His version didn't work either. All my effort was wasted Riefenstahl's steely determination enabled her to conquer not a new rock-face, but also to overcome all obstacles in her career The fight in the editing room was to prove the first of many And she always got her way For several days, I just wept and then I began to edit it again And this exercise was very therapeutic Although I didn't like Fanck's cut... ...I noticed lots of things he'd done... ...which I'd never have thought of, like the inter-cutting of scenes Fanck had cut too much but I saw it was wrong not to cut at all So I took it over and edited it in a rhythm... ...I felt right for the subject. I hadn't done that before If a director shoots a scene that goes on too long... ...he doesn't always realise it needs cutting A particularly important scene was in the moonlight... ...when the peasants shut their doors At first I'd edited it - man shuts the door, next a man shuts door and so on That was the logical way but Fanck did it differently He had one man starting to shut his door, the next continuing the action This variety gave more interest and tension It was a very special method which I intuitively understood... ...and which I applied to my subject I still did things more slowly than he had, but not as slowly as before I was learning Don't close the shutters... ...in this fine weather It's full moon Ah, the blue light I played this girl Junta, who is a kind of witch It's as if it were a premonition of my own life Junta was loved and hated It's been the same for me - I've been loved and hated Just as Junta lost her ideal... ...through the shattering of the crystal... ...in the same way I lost my ideals at the end of that terrible war To that extent the film was indeed a premonition of my own destiny Were you already in contact with the National Socialists? I didn't know of their existence. I hadn't even heard of Hitler When I was filming 'The Blue Light' I had no idea Didn't Hans Jaeger say something to you about Hitler? He said to me: "Are you going to this National Socialist meeting today?" I didn't understand so I said "Why? What about it?" "Hitler's speaking today in Berlin, in the Sports Palace", he said "So what?" I said Then he said, "I've a feeling... "...that if you heard him, it could change your life" I laughed and asked "How could it do that?" So Jaeger, who was an anti-Nazi, though I didn't know that, said: "Take my advice and go" And as I was curious, I went And indeed it did change my fate I know, my comrades... ...that it was hard for you when you thought change must come... ...and it never came When endless appeals were made to you that the fight must go on Calls not to act but to obey To resist but not to bend under this monstrous pressure It was the first time I'd ever seen a political meeting I found it immensely impressive and I was carried away by the atmosphere Hitler really fascinated me So I immediately wrote him a letter I wanted to meet him. I thought: May be he is the man who can save Germany When I asked his adjutant why I'd received a reply, he said: "The Führer was thrilled with your dance by the sea... "...in 'The Sacred Mountain'" What was your impression of him? Interestingly, quite the opposite of my impression at the Stadium There he'd seemed a politician... ...trying to enthuse people Now he seemed a modest, private individual You couldn't imagine him stirring the masses He seemed very natural, straightforward, modest and friendly When I'd seen his face on posters, I'd thought him decidedly ugly But when I met him personally, that all disappeared You just didn't notice his features and the mustache He radiated something very powerful You forgot all the rest But as a man he did not interest me at all You sensed he had a kind of demonic power of suggestion? Yes, at the public meeting... ...and even more strongly when I met him He radiated something which had a kind of hypnotic effect That frightened me a little I didn't want to lose my own will and my freedom I already felt... ...I had to avoid this atmosphere at all costs It would paralyse one's free will What did you make of his political programme? I knew nothing about it... ...and had no time to find out because I was off to Greenland She was soon being typecast. In this big Hollywood production, Leni Riefenstahl once again plays the part of the beautiful daredevil The plucky rescue pilot in the Arctic She embodied an ideal which Hitler was cleverly to exploit Incidentally, he said then: "When we come to power, you must make my films" I certainly didn't take him seriously. I said: "I can only do what I enjoy. I'm an actress, I want nice parts to play" It is precisely these roles which created the image of Riefenstahl that Hitler so admired, a heroic superwoman, the queen of the mountains, enthroned high among the peaks, beyond the reach of the masses, an idol, a myth larger than life In other words, exactly what Hitler himself so much wanted to be but so conspicuously lacked the artistic tinge to achieve Then Hitler said, "Well, when you're older and more mature... "...maybe you'll understand my ideas" I was ignorant then In January 1933, Hitler became Reich's Chancellor with immediate consequences German men and women... ...the age of pettifogging Jewish intellectualism... ...is at an end The breakthrough of the German revolution... ...had cleared the path ahead for Germany I consign all that is un-German to the flames I consign to the fire the writings... ...of Heinrich Mann... ...Ernst Glaeser... {\a8}...and Erich Kästner As ever, at the crucial time, Leni Riefenstahl was absent {\a8}Down with time-servers and political traitors filming in the Swiss Alps I heard nothing about the book-burning. We hadn't television then I learnt about it on my return... ...and particularly about friends of mine... Who had emigrated? I found their letters in my post They wrote to me and that really upset me And when I was summoned... ...to see Hitler, I immediately spoke to him about it His face darkened suddenly and he said: "I must ask you, Fräulein, not to speak to me on this matter" You did try to raise the subject? Immediately. It was the first thing I tried... ...and realised it wasn't possible He immediately called his adjutant and had me ushered out He wouldn't talk to me about it Clearly, something in Germany had fundamentally changed In the brutal boycott of Jewish shops gave her no cause to doubt How could she have overlooked what she saw around her in Germany? My friends who'd emigrated... ...and Manfred Georg in particular... ...urged me to stay and stick it out By staying, we could prevent the spread of anti-semitism We were to be a bulwark against it And we all thought it was just electioneering... ...a temporary thing that would die down We didn't foresee the danger Didn't 'Mein Kampf' open your eyes... ...to Hitler's aims? It was very interesting I hadn't read it all - just a few chapters Some things in it appealed to me very much Everything that dealt with social problems I think that was why Hitler had so many supporters then Six million unemployed, the poverty... Obviously I didn't like his racial theories I made notes in the book which later happened to fall into Hitler's hands I had written 'good' or 'bad', 'not good' etc. So I had made my choices - How did he react to this critique? - He laughed {\a8}Ladies and gentlemen Goebbels' diaries for the year 1933 give the distinct impression that {\a8}With one bold and magnificent stroke... Riefenstahl was on good terms socially with both Hitler and Goebbels {\a8}...we've put our enemies to flight What was your relationship with the Propaganda Minister, Goebbels? The worst you can ever imagine We met before they came to power It was in the lift at the Hotel Kaiserhof. We were both going up He pursued me and was determined to have me He wanted me as his mistress and so on But he was not my type at all I felt nothing for him He never forgave me for rejecting him. Later it became worse I can say he was almost an enemy Reading Goebbels' diaries for 1933, we get the impression... ...you were on visiting terms with him and Hitler You must show me these entries. I've never read them I've never read anything saying I was on visiting terms. It's sheer fantasy Saw Leni Riefenstahl this afternoon, suggested a film about Hitler to her She was enthusiastic In the evening to Madam Butterfly with Magda and Leni At the start of 1933 I'd never visited him. He never said I had Drove back with Hitler in the evening Later at home, Philipp von Hessen and Leni Riefenstahl called 'very nice' I never went there Nor to Schwanenwerder, where everyone went I wasn't even invited. Not once Saw a film with Hitler starring Hans Albers, terrible rubbish Gerda, Maria and Leni Riefenstahl were there. Three beautiful women This makes me so angry. What you say is incredible Let me show you That I was on social terms... there's nothing about that in the diaries... It's simply not true. Herr Müller OK, show me where it says I was in and out of their houses, socially What to believe? The diaries of Goebbels or the memories of last surviving witness Goebbels was a master of the lie Nuremberg, the imperial castle of the Holy Roman Emperors, the Kaiserberg A place special significance for Hitler In his imagination, Hitler saw himself in the tradition of the German Emperors And like them based his ideal of the Führer on an image of the Roman Caesers That's why the congresses of the Nazi party were organized in Nuremberg Today, very little remains of the Nazi buildings, the popular enthusiasm for the big courage is no longer comprehensible This is where the great march pasts took place involving as many as a hundred thousand men Riefenstahl's film of the 1934 Party Congress was the turning point in her life It changed everything {\a8}38,000 workers on parade for the ceremony Later Congresses were filmed by other directors But they've long been forgotten The first film was to have been the one and only Never two or three. Just the one Party Congress film But the first one in 1933 was never completed We only filmed a few metres before we were interrupted The Party didn't want us to make the film despite Hitler's commission It was boycotted Until recently, Riefenstahl's first film of the Nazi Congresses in Nuremberg, Victory of Faith, was thought to have been lost Many doubted that it was ever actually been made Grotesque as it may sound, the Party who were supposed to make the film... ...didn't want me to make it But you were involved in the other film? You brought that up yourself I know, but it's very hard to keep them apart We can cut it out It's hard to keep it separate I'm happy to talk about it but not in this bloody light Reporting to the Führer {\a8}100,000 Storm-Troopers, Stahlhelm... In those days, Hitler and Ernst Röhm were still the partners in the struggle for power {\a8}...and SS on parade before the Führer Heil, SA You talked about the first film and the second. You can't do that I have to say what the first film is. You can't talk about both at once - You mentioned the second film - And you the first - That's the one I want to discuss - Not me. I hardly did anything on it With its amateury shots of Hitler, and rather elementary camera angles Victory of Faith is perhaps understandably a film Riefenstahl is very reluctant to talk about To this day, she is annoyed about the conditions in which she had to film and which made it impossible for her to achieve her usual perfection No, the first one wasn't a proper Party Congress film It was just a few shots I put together, because Hitler wanted it It has nothing to do with my technique You can only discuss technique in 'Triumph of the Will' In the first film there was no technique? No, we couldn't prepare. When I arrived the Congress was in progress Let me explain why. My dear Herr Müller, I could do nothing The party forbade it. Hitler and Goebbels had had a row If you mention the first film... ...I must say why I couldn't use my techniques Go ahead But, my God, it's too important to discuss here! Not only was the camera work shoddy, but the organization of the event itself seemed uncharacteristically chaotic The Nazis have not yet learned how to march like Nazis It is quite obvious that both Hitler and Riefenstahl were still trying to get it right The first wasn't a proper film Just a few scenes of them running around here, which we put together Didn't you edit it yourself? Yes I did. I had to put it together but I had scarcely any material {\a8}A society... However some sequences already have the characteristic Riefenstahl touch {\a8}...without regard... ...to origin, class... ...profession, wealth or education A society... ...which feels itself bound together, united... {\a8}...in one great faith and one great purpose In places like this, the mark of Riefenstahl was unmistakable {\a8}Not for position... A dramatic intensity humped up by the composition and the editing {\a8}...and not for party Not for profession... ...and not for class... ...but united in our one Germany Your clients were satisfied? They'd have been happy with any old newsreel provided it showed swastikas Nevertheless the film had to be edited. It became a short It was shown in some cinema or other, I forget where Hitler and the others liked it It was interesting but they weren't satisfied Hitler insisted I make another film the following year Were you dissatisfied too? To me it wasn't a proper film. Just some shots Again and again one can see clearly that Hitler was not yet in sole command Beside him, and on the same level stands his storm trooper commander, Ernst Röhm Shortly afterwards, Hitler had him assassinated An attempt by the the party to boycott her filming angered angered Riefenstahl so much that she immediately complained to Hitler I explained exactly what the problem was Goebbels was present, and you can imagine what happened next Goebbels went white as a sheet Hitler was furious, beside himself. He said: "This must never happen again. You will make the film next year" I said I can't. I'll never do another one" I'd made up my mind not to I ran out in floods of tears... ...and soon after I got home, there was a phone call to say... ...I had to go and see Goebbels It was the day Goebbels went to Geneva... ...to announce that Germany was leaving the League of Nations That's why I remember I got to his office in the Propaganda Ministry and he screamed at me: "If you were a man and not a woman... "...I'd throw you downstairs "You're a dangerous woman. Never let me set eyes on you again" That's how it ended And everything that came later resulted from this hate In 1934, Riefenstahl was back filming in Nuremberg This time she was given a free hand, a triumph of her own will, {\a8}TRIUMPH OF THE WILL or a pact with the devil Today it's easy to think that Now that we know all the terrible things he did and got others to do... then clearly it was a pact with the Devil But we didn't know then Hitler probably was schizophrenic, both a devil... ...and its opposite, but we could only see one side of him Not that terrible, dangerous side I just wanted to act I didn't want to take on this terrible workload I wasn't against it for political reasons. Not at all I just wanted to do something different But Hitler's wish was his command It would have been difficult if not impossible to get out of it I made one last attempt by driving to Nuremberg where I knew Hitler was I saw him at a meeting with Speer and others, and he had the plans He said: "Fräulein Riefenstahl, give me six days of your life, just six days "I want this film to be made by an artist and not a Party film-director" "I'll make it", I said... "...if you promise me I'll never have to make another film for the Reich... "...for you or the Party" At vast expense, Riefenstahl made 'Triumph of the Will', which to this day is regarded by film historians as the best propaganda film of all time Riefenstahl has always maintained that the making of this film was just a job, which she performed to perfection When I began my documentary... ...I wondered what I could do to make it better than the newsreels In 1934, when I made 'Triumph of the Will'... ...newsreels were very static, no movement, no travelling shots I thought the shots should be made mobile and thus more interesting That's why my crew began trying to shoot on roller-skates But above all I needed lots of different... ...camera positions It doesn't look like a documentary, more like an art film How did you achieve this artistic intensity? It's a feeling for links between images A connection between one picture and the next... ...or from one visual colour-range, say from grey tones, to another It's like a musical composition It's very important... ...to put climax at the right point in a film... ...so that there's a continuous build-up We stand here We stand at the ready... ...to take Germany into the new age Germany I tried a hundred different ways at the editing stage It took me over five months First I was working 12 hours a day, then 14, 18... ...and in the end 20 That meant I couldn't do anything but sit at my editing-suite... ...trying to find ways to avoid jumps... ...so it would all flow in an interesting way I tried hundreds of ways Comrade, where are you from? From Friesland And you? - From Bavaria - And you? From Kaiserstuhl And you? From Pomerania And from Königsberg From Silesia From the North Sea coast From Black Forest From Dresden - From the Danube - From the Rhine And from the Saar One people... ...one Führer, one Reich Germany This artistic depth you mention... ...brought accusations against you later of glorifying the Nazis But those people should have tried making the film themselves Either one makes a newsreel and those were made... ...or one can try to make the material into a film... ...that's more interesting - but without posed shots In Flanders... ...in the west... ...in the east... ...in the south... ...on land and water and in the skies... ...the Red menace and forces of reaction have been brought down Did you notice that in this film... ...there was no commentary in the normal sense of the word? There's no commentator to explain everything That's one way it differs... ...from a documentary and a propaganda film If it were propaganda, as many say, there'd be a commentator... ...to explain the significance and value of the occasion This wasn't the case The looming close-ups of Hitler in this film were the first that the German people had ever seen It wasn't hard because Hitler never let himself be distracted You could dance round him all you liked Didn't you build a track round him? Yes, that was one idea. I had to film 3 or 4 of Hitler's speeches How could I make each one different and avoid repetition? I thought, for one of the speeches, of laying a circular track round him The speech would be more interesting than if shot from a fixed point We want a final end to class differences You must not let them develop among you We want one day to see one Reich You must make yourselves fit for it We want this people one day to be obedient... ...so you must learn obedience We want our people to be peace-loving but also brave... ...so you must be peaceable You see that lift there? We had such difficulty getting permission for that. I'll run it back We got permission... ...to build a tiny camera lift into the flag-poles The effect was very good What's striking is the contrast... ...between the huge crowds and one individual - Hitler Is that a conscious technique? There was nothing else. Just Hitler and the people Wasn't it difficult since you had no idea about politics... ...to edit political speeches? That has nothing to do with politics. It's a technical matter If a 2-hour speech, regardless of it content... ...trees or fish or politics - needs cutting down to 5 minutes... ...any editor will take out everything he can The speech must have a beginning and an end... ...and two or three important sentences in the middle Everything else has to go. You need a real beginning, an end... ...and in the middle something which thrills the people Any editor can do that. It's not a problem You were guided by the applause? Yes, the effect, people's expressions If you're an editor... ...and you can cut out Hitler wiping his nose or coughing... ...you drop that and use the shots where his expression is more interesting Of course you do. An editor must decide which shots work best That isn't politics. Anyway, a speech will only have one theme We live by one great commandment... ...and this was not given us... ...by any earthly authority It was given us by God... ...who created our people These Congresses were so well staged, and still seem so today Did you direct them or who planned them? Don't make me laugh. Why should I be involved? I wasn't even a Party member, let alone an organiser What makes you think I was involved? They were great productions. Who dreamed them up? - Hitler and Speer - All by themselves? Yes. I had nothing to do with it. I knew nothing. I'd no idea about it I just observed and tried to film it well The idea that I helped to plan it is downright absurd Those crowd scenes look like something out of a Wagner opera You see such scenes in Moscow and Peking You saw those huge parades a few months ago... ...in Peking and in Korea. You see them everywhere Those parades were vast Far more grandiose than in 'Triumph of the Will' You saw weapons and missiles going past Platform decorated with hundreds of red flags. All on a huge scale It had to be filmed the way an artist, not a politician, sees it Hitler didn't want a political film. He wanted an artistic film That's what he got. I'd no idea I could do it My not wanting to make the film had nothing to do with politics I just lacked confidence. It seemed an insoluble task Still, you were later accused of seducing people with this film OK, a few idiots say that All I can say is it's thoroughly stupid It would mean that I staged it, that I was Hitler himself... ...and I'd made all these people pose for me Didn't a film-maker have terrific public influence... ...in the days before radio and television? Doesn't that artist have a special responsibility? What was my responsibility? By that time 90% of the people were in favour of Hitler Should I have been a resistance fighter? There were a very few of those Should I have been one of them? No, since you say politics didn't interest you... Not at all. To me the film wasn't about politics, it was an event I'd have made exactly the same film in Moscow, if the need arose... ...though I'd have preferred not Or in America, if something of the sort had taken place there I shot the subject-matter as well as I could and shaped it into a film Now, whether it was about politics or about vegetables or fruit... ...I couldn't give a damn. I don't get it If I'd been political... ...I'd have joined the Party and I would have been interested - I didn't mean it like that - I never went to any meetings I turned down all offers to make other political films I never made a single one My question is this If one works in the media, mustn't one interest oneself in politics? Nowadays, perhaps, but not then. And anyway, who'd have done it? Everyone was behind Hitler If you were an artist today... ...what would you feel your political responsibility to be? The artist should maybe ask himself what will be done with his creation How are we to judge artists... ...who, for example, made films during the Stalin period? Like Eisenstein or Pudovkin. What should we say... ...about those who made films - very good ones - in the GDR? What should we say about artists who made good films in the Third Reich? What does political responsibility mean? And to whom is one responsible? Take politics today. How can you tell... ...who can assure us the right kind of future? It's our desire and intention... ...that this Reich shall exist... ...for thousands of years to come We can be happy... ...in the knowledge that this future belongs wholly to us There's another thing I want to say If an artist dedicates himself totally to his work... ...he cannot think politically That's true of practically every artist in the past... ...who produced great works Be it Michelangelo, Rodin, Rubens or the Impressionists None of these people... ...had any time a feeling for politics And even if they had, they shouldn't see into the future You also asked - I'll answer that later... ...whether 'Triumph of the Will' had any message While I was actually filming, of course I had no such thoughts But when I was editing... ...I did discover a certain message in it. You can find it yourself It's firstly the creation of jobs, through the labour-service scheme... ...and above all the speech by Hess where he says: You were... ...the guarantor of victory You are our guarantor of peace Adolf Hitler. Sieg heil! At the time we felt that one of the messages was peace It recurs throughout the film Other political motives or objectives aren't mentioned There's nothing about anti-semitism or race-theory Work and peace are the only messages in 'Triumph of the Will' There were films with far more swastika-banners... ...full of political bias 'Triumph' had none of this... ...so I never felt I'd done anything that could do any damage If it had been harmful, the French would never have given it a gold medal... Olympic's film on camera That was a week before war broke out At the time she says, all that matter to her was the aesthetics of film ...two years before the outbreak of war The National Film Prize for 1934/35 is awarded... ...to Leni Riefenstahl for her film of the Nuremberg Party Congress... 'Triumph of the Will' This work stands out as a great achievement... ...in the year's film output It is especially relevant because it presents our age It shows, in monumental images never before seen... ...the thrilling events of our political life It is the great vision of the Führer on film... ...presented in images of a vividness never before seen Politically speaking, the significance of this film... ...was that it was in tune with the times That's to say, 90% of Germans, and a majority of foreigners... ...believed in the peace that was being proclaimed When you look at 'Triumph of the Will' now... ...you must be proud of it But it had also made the second half of your life extremely hard How do you see it? I've never been proud of it. Neither today, nor then Proud of what? All that was slaving, all that work - it was ghastly I nearly ruined my health editing the film, and for what? True, the film was considered a good documentary But since the war it's been slated because it's seen as propaganda Before the war, of course, the film got all the international awards... ...like the Gold Medal in Paris and the one at the Biennale But after the war I not only got brickbats... ...I was castigated because of it So not only am I not proud... ...I'm deeply unhappy I made it If I'd known what the film would bring me. I'd never have made it Half a century later, the terrible legacy of the Nazis is still being digested in Germany After the war, Leni Riefenstahl, the obsessed and politically blinkered filmmaker was boycotted and universally despised To this day, she's not been able to make another film, that is the price she's had to pay for her brilliant career under the Nazis This shot is one of my favorites I got the effect... I brought out the festive quality... ...by using a telephoto lens That's why the banners look so densely packed And here comes something else It's the effect of the shots taken from the lift Now the camera swings... ...to one side... ...over to the right And then the camera swings... ...the other way... ...to the left These two angles produce the form of a circle... ...thus making a powerful impact Here the two lines of banners appear to be cutting across each other That was made possible by using different camera positions And the editing gives it a balletic quality It's cut in time to the music Those are the banners of the Stahlhelm There were various formations marching past That's interesting too {\a8}The way they walk down the steps Today, Triumph of the Will remains under lockened key in Germany {\a8}Here, do you see? People are still afraid to examine the film seriously {\a8}Precisely in time with the music Can a film really be that dangerous? Or is it too vivid a reminder of something that many would prefer to forget Interesting, isn't it? End of the first part In 1936, Leni Riefenstahl made the official film of the Olympic Games in Berlin After the war, this documentary was listed in America as one of the world's ten best films I wondered, could I make this film? Could I make it interesting? And suddenly I had before my eyes a picture... ...of the Olympic Games in ancient Greece Not only the stadium... ...but the whole culture - the temples, the sculptures The transition from the ancient world to the modern... ...had wonderful dramatic possibilities It was easier to present it in purely visual terms... ...rather than as a series of actions Riefenstahl was to direct the entire film, even the sport sequences Athlete models freeze by the bold take for Riefenstahl's camera Under Riefenstahl's direction, the athletes would turn from ordinary models into sporting Gods - How did you prepare for the film? - Mainly by training the cameramen Everything depended on them I had four or five young men that I trained for months... ...at athletics meetings, football matches and so on Often without film, just to practice camera movements... ...and get the quick reactions we needed Never before had so much been spent on preparing to film a documentary Officially Riefenstahl had received the assignment from the Olympic committee, but it was the German Ministry of Propaganda which actually provided the funds through indirect channels Despite the economic problems of the times, the resources put to the director's disposal were almost unlimited For the first time in many years, Riefenstahl is reunited {\a8}You still look so well {\a8}I've no complaints with two of her old cameramen {\a8}Congratulations You never change, do you? My two best cameramen here again after half a century Walter Frentz on the right was an expert in handheld camera On the left is Guzzi Lantschner I'll tell you something. Diving I can still do... ...but that film - I couldn't make it again Much too strenuous We worked like mad Late into the night. We couldn't do that now Look. Just as it was Do you remember, Guzzi... ...how we looked for places to get the best angles? We turned the stadium into a film studio Many technical innovations were tried out in Olympiad It was the first film in which pits were dug, so that the athletes could be filmed against the sky We had to fight for every hole we dug You were always the one... ...with the exact eye... ...for a shot Whether it should be half a metre right or left Riefenstahl now had the full scope to apply the lesson she had learned from Arnold Fanck, her great mentor The best idea we had - I think it was your idea - was the catapult We built a track with a catapult on it which travelled... ...alongside the sprinters It was fantastic but they banned it We had lots of new ideas Yes. The most important one was... ...digging a hole for the pole-vault Out in the field, to the left And we filmed the whole thing... ...against the Olympic flame. It gave us some marvellous shots She was later reproached for many of the images pioneered in Olympiad Her critics felt that the cult of the body beautiful Riefenstahl's obsession with strength and athletic perfection were unmistakably fascist The same was later said of her photographs of Nuba tribesmen It was important that each cameraman... ...had a different lens and camera You sometimes had a Bell & Howell and sometimes Sinclair - And you had a Bell & Howell - With two speeds Normal, 24 frames per second and fast, up to 48 That was important for the diving The body could be seen so much more clearly That was the first time... Then we got the close-ups with the Ascania We had a special lens made for us - a 600mm telephoto They didn't exist then Herr Shalck got those marvellous close-ups Even though we couldn't get near the runners We still got tight in on faces Owens in the lead, Strandberg behind him, Rosenthal creeping up Metcalfe makes a spurt. It's over. Owens wins the 100 metre sprint I remember something else The balloon. Do you remember? Everyday we sent up a balloon... ...with a tiny 5 metre camera... ...to get an overall aerial view Everyday it landed somewhere different - on roofs and things None of the shots were any use Anyone finding this camera would discover a little note in it asking them to return it to the Leni Riefenstahl production team We had the balloon at the regatta in Grünau It crashed before the races finished I cried. It was terrible There was nothing they did not try out A many of these experiments have become standard practice in film production A break in the shoot Leni and her old campaigners stop for coffee I had so many arguments in those days And them, in 1935, Churchill said "I envy the Germans their Führer" I thought "How can I be cleverer than Churchill? He really said that" Two years later, he said "The German swine must now be slaughtered" I like your style. You'll do And you were well in there... ...because you flew to Moscow with Ribbentrop... ...with the two copies of the Treaty {\a8}Stalin wrote a letter which the Russian ambassador gave me Riefenstahl refuses to get drawn into {\a8}That was a week before war broke out a political discussion about the Olympic's film on camera At the time she says all that mattered to her was the aesthetics of film I had 30 cameramen Not all here. There were other events in Grünau and Kiel There were also indoor events and the cameramen were spread around Much of what is now a normal practice in an age of electronic live reporting, was first tried out then by Leni Riefenstahl In Olympiad, she set new standards for filming sporting events and went far beyond the traditional bounds of a sport documentary Nothing was left to chance Dramatic scenes, which her crew could not get close enough to during the competition, were filmed in advance during training and later spliced into the final footage In this way, many of the documentary sequences had changed the dramatic impact of a feature film It was worst when there were a lot of us I had to assign jobs to everyone I could only organise this once the day's shoot had finished There was a production meeting every night I'd have just 5 minutes to talk to each person... ...and give out assignments... {\a8}...according to people's skills The logistics of the operation were remarkable They had no walkie-talkies or talkback Riefenstahl planned the entire shoot like a military campaign Every camera angle was deliberate and coordinated I really admired her She had an incredible ability for composing shots And a tremendous eye The shots she selected were always just right The winner is England She had such energy and determination When we began the Olympics film... ...we wanted to dig a hole beside the pole-vault... ...so we could film the vaulters against the sky But the Olympic Committee said it would endanger the athletes So Leni said "Let me talk to them" She went to the Committee and said: "Our film will be ruined if we can't do this" She came back that night and said "We can do it". I cried my eyes out As a superbly organized sporting event, the Berlin Olympics gave the Nazis an opportunity to present Germany as a peaceful, tolerant and powerful nation. And it is natural to assume that Hitler would've welcomed the games Hitler wasn't pleased I was making the film Hitler wasn't in the least interested in the Olympics He didn't like the Games at all. He told me so himself It was understandable Hitler wouldn't enjoy watching blacks win Seeing all those international stars when he was such a Nationalist A new world record. And gold for America Wasn't this a chance to present a certain image of Germany? Possibly - but Hitler wasn't interested It took a lot of convincing to make him come Come to the Games and Germany will do better, they said He didn't care. He didn't like the stadium It was too small He didn't like the architecture Ask anyone who was there They'll tell you Hitler had no interest in the Games The result of all this complicated coverage was 250 miles of film You shot 400 km of film. How did you cope with so much material? First of all, people don't understand why we shot so much film They should remember that there were 136 different events In the athletics heats, we never knew if a record would be broken So we had to film everything - hence the quantities of film Once again, Riefenstahl's legendary sense of order and impeccable planning enabled her and her team to keep a grasp on this vast project Even so, the editing alone took two years, as always, she did it herself, obsessively editing and re-editing her film This little machine... The Litax machine invented by Dr. Fanck... ...made it possible to edit very fast We didn't have to splice the strips of film into reels... ...which was so time consuming All we did was slot the film into this machine... ...and snap it shut We could then look and edit the film accurately If I don't like a sequence, I throw the film into the bin... ...or put it round my neck for later Then I take another sequence and compare it This enables me... ...without exaggeration... ...to work ten times faster than otherwise This system only works for documentaries, not for features... ...because here the soundtrack is put on later One of the most difficult sequences was the marathon. The ultimate test of sporting endurance Once again, she used feature film techniques to capture the sweat and the pain I had to think hard how I could shape the 26-mile race... ...into a few short minutes that would be exciting and interesting I soon realised I couldn't achieve this... ...just by filming the race step by step Instead, I'd have to try... ...to show the feelings, the mental state of the marathon runners And I thought I could best express that... ...by showing the exhaustion in their faces How, though their legs were like lead... ...they didn't collapse but kept going by sheer willpower Willpower can't be shown visually but can be indicated by music If you listen, you'll hear the music seeming to drive the runners on The music expresses the will not to collapse but to reach the stadium The camera looks down the torso, as we'd practised it... ...to the tired legs almost sticking to the asphalt And this difference, this portrayal... ...maybe raised the film above the level of ordinary reportage Leni Riefenstahl, on an official mission, visits the exhibition The star of German cinema speaks You've been invited here to present your film It was very hard work but I'm happy the task was entrusted to me People don't understand why 'Olympia' has taken so long to release We shot 400,000 metres of film And it's a huge task, sorting through this footage... ...putting it in order and making a film out of it Just viewing all the film took 10 weeks I spent 10 hours a day in the projection-room That gives you an idea of what's involved For the men's high diving, we experimented a lot Up till then it had been done rather boringly... ...with a single shot of the man plunging off the board We set up three cameras for this event Guzzi Lantschner was up there with a hand-held camera And Hans Ertl below... ...with an underwater camera Over there was the slow motion camera... ...so that the diving could be filmed from all angles The most interesting experiment was the underwater shooting It had never been done before Ertl had built himself a camera and sat in the water He followed the diver down till he hit the water... ...switched to slow motion, changed focus... ...and kept the camera on the diver until he surfaced It's the Japanese girl again We experimented with the swimming too Over there for the swimming... ...we pushed the camera along on a rubber raft, hanging from a rig... ...to get close-ups of the swimmers' faces But we couldn't use it in the finals Higgins Yldefonzo... Koike... Ito A fight to the finish I wanted a crescendo of intensity I began mundanely enough with the women's diving... ...giving the diver's names. With the men I left that out I just edited to highlight the diving itself and the movement They looked like birds swooping through the air This looked very attractive... ...so, to heighten the effect, I used different tempi when editing If you look, you'll see the first dive is at normal speed Then the next one is a bit slower - not quite slow motion but almost And so on until full slow motion But even that wasn't enough. They really had to look like birds Her creative editing techniques are seen to greatest artistic effect in high diving It's only when you disentangle her handy work on an editing desk that you realize how some of the sequences were printed backwards and that the diver was actually springing out of water reversing through the air and landing back on the spring-board I achieved this by sometimes splicing in a sequence back to front But it was hardly noticeable. It just enhanced the feeling of movement It simply became a form of artistic expression The creative sport photography in Olympiad has rarely been bettered To what extent, though, of these films an expression of the Fascist spirit which prevailed in Germany at that time? Is Riefenstahl no more than an artist obsessed, blind to events outside her cutting? The question remains unanswered Today, aged 90, she still repeats what she has always said that art and politics are two different things, that one has nothing to do with the other The premier of Olympiad took place on Hitler's 49th birthday Immediately afterwards, she went on a European tour with her film It was hailed everywhere as a triumph and success The German Film Prize 1937-38... ...goes to Leni Riefenstahl... ...for the film "Olympia" April 1938, the premiere in Vienna Eighteen months later, the Second World War broke out All Vienna welcomes you Thank you for your kind words I am so very happy to be in Vienna and attending the premiere I've not been here for five years This is my first chance to see Vienna since our Führer came to power In November of that year, Germany witnessed the notorious Kristallnacht The persecution of the Jews reached new extremes But once again Riefenstahl wasn't there to see it It was on a boat sailing for New York that she first learnt of the Kristallnacht But her trip to Hollywood was a fiasco The film industry which included many German emigrants demanded a boycott I didn't believe it. It seemed impossible I'd read so many false reports about Germany in the American newspapers I thought it was lies, so I said so Its nothing true, what the American newspapers write about the Nazis I couldn't believe it but, when I got to New York. I saw huge headlines One page said "Synagogues burnt down, shops looted. Jews persecuted" On the next page: "Riefenstahl says..." Its nothing true, what the American newspapers write about the Nazis Whenever I was asked, I said "It can't be true. It's impossible" KILL THE JEWS Now you're going to ask me why I didn't leave Germany You see, I loved my homeland The ones who left were emigrants and people who'd been banned I could work. I was free. I hoped it would never happen again We all hoped it was an isolated event All true art must imprint... ...the stamp of beauty on itself All that is healthy is right and natural What is right and natural is beautiful It's our task to discover true beauty We must not be led astray... ...by the mad, impudent drivel... ...of effete literati who decry... ...the natural and beautiful as kitsch The pictures were awful They were all kitsch I hardly saw a picture I liked I was very disappointed at the time because my great love was modern art Along with the French Impressionists and Cranach But what the National Socialists... ...considered - or called or admired as art - was for me kitsch EXHIBITION OF DEGENERATE ART ADMISSION FREE Pure German artistic sensibility means nothing to a rootless Jew What he calls art must titillate as depraved senses It must be cloaked in corruption as sickness It must be unnatural, grotesque, perverse... ...or pathological These febrile fantasies... ...of incurably sick minds... ...were once flaunted before the public by Jewish art critics... ...as the highest form of artistic expression Surely speeches like this would've made any sensitive artist stop and ponder After everything that had happened it was the least one could expect Hitler made a speech about art and it was so wrong that I thought: "If he can be so wrong and yet sound so convincing about art - "...so convincing many believed him - "...maybe he's making political mistakes too" That's when I began to have real doubts I became much more critical when I listened to his speeches... ...but I must admit I was never an opponent In 1939, German troops marched into Poland Riefenstahl was sent to the front as a war reporter But on her first day there she witnessed the brutal ill treatment of Polish civilians A photograph seems to testify to her horror Riefenstahl made an official complaint to the Nazi General in charge And left Poland immediately In August 1940, the German troops marched into Paris The Blitzkrieg in the west was over Riefenstahl sent a Euphoric telegram to the Führer Mein Führer, it is with indescribable joy, deep emotion and warm gratitude, that we share your greatest and Germany's greatest victory, the entry of German troops into Paris Your deeds exceed the power of human imagination they are without equal in the history of mankind, how can we ever thank you? Simply to offer you my congratulations is an inadequate expression of the feelings that have stirred me I didn't send the telegram... ...because our troops were in France, and because of our victory... ...but because we thought the war was over. We were in a frenzy of joy For three days the bells rang and people kissed on the streets We all believed this terrible war was over It was in this mood that I sent Hitler my enthusiastic telegram However there was no question of peace now. after Germany's attack on Russia the conflict in Europe escalated and became a World War But Riefenstahl has retreated to the mountains again She had begun work on Tiefland, the lowlands A film version of d'Albert's opera It was forced on me... ...because I wanted to keep my head down and avoid making war films "Tiefland" was a neutral subject Since "Olympia" had paid off... ...I was completely free and had enough money to make a film... ...from a purely artistic perspective Once again, Riefenstahl had an opportunity to dance. Set in Spain, the story tackles the social conflict between farmers and land owners When the production was later moved to Bavaria, they needed characters who looked Mediterranean Gypsies were brought in from a Gypsy concentration camp near Salzburg to be used as extras This is one of the main accusations that continues to be levelled at Riefenstahl to this day List of extras from detention camp in Leopoldskron With Hitler's support at the beginning of the project, Riefenstahl was given {\a8}Come to the castle. {\a8}She shall dance for me as much foreign currency as she needed to start filming in Spain But the production was dogged by misfortune It was a disaster from the start We began by looking for our locations in Spain... ...to keep costs down But the war came and we couldn't stay in Spain Our crew left by the very last plane We then had to build all the sets with mountains behind We had to build an entire Bavarian village. It was very hard Then the snow came and destroyed the village and it had to be rebuilt As we weren't part of the war effort, we waited 2 years for a studio We had to tear our sets down so propaganda films could be made Many of these look like paintings. How did you achieve this effect? It was my intention, with this film... ...to concentrate on the visual... ...and maintain the art of filming in black and white At that time there was a big switch to colour Most films were in colour and hardly anything was in black and white Black and white is a special kind of art, like graphic art I wanted to make a film... ...which would prove there are effects in black and white... ...that can't be bettered - or achieved at all - with colour God be with you, Pedro Good day to you, Nando! - I'm glad to be up here again - You're up from the Deep Valley? I've brought flour and salt. Up here, Pedro, I feel so much freer I worked a lot with filters Here I used an orange filter so this shot - I remember clearly... ...had to have an aperture of around 3.2... - For depth... - No, for an airy, atmospheric effect In my films I always made sure the men... ...actors or not, were lit differently... ...from the women They were lit... ...from the side so their features stood out Whereas, what's important with women is to make them look... ...young and lovely The same lighting can make a woman look... ...20 years youngers or olders, depending on the angle Make yourself beautiful That's how you must look With a young woman, who must look beautiful... ...you need a very soft light from the front No side-lighting at all, so no facial lines or flaws are visible The only really pretty subjects to photograph are babies They've absolutely no wrinkles Even if a woman has only slight lines on her face... ...they'll appear worse on film Lighting is very important Marlene Dietrich always had the same lighting Same lighting with a lamp right above her It shone down on her face, gave her shadows, and made her look thin Another woman would need different lighting What kind did you need? I needed a soft front light - quite high, but not as high as Marlene's I didn't want to look as gaunt as her but I did need soft front-lighting Wait till I'm sitting I just want to see what I need Better go in a bit closer To achieve this picturesque effect... ...you must look for subjects which make a composition in themselves You can't set up a camera just anywhere Outdoors, the aperture is generally reduced because there's so much light This gives a sharp focus and robs the shot of air and atmosphere To avoid this sharpness and still keep a feeling of realism... ...I used very strong filters I could filter out the light without reducing the aperture... ...and achieve this picturesque effect - sometimes with coloured filters The hut wasn't built and then filmed First we chose it, selected the background and set up the camera Then, using the eye of the camera... ...we incorporated the hut into the whole composition That's how we achieved this harmonious effect - Can I have something to drink? - Yes, I've plenty of milk The film was almost finished when the war ended Everything was carted off to France where it lay for 10 years The French hacked it about and tried to make it into a film A lot of footage was lost I had to employ several lawyers to get the material back Then I had to put it together. It was quite a saga While Riefenstahl was working on Tiefland, the war entered its final phase As the bombs rained down on Berlin, Riefenstahl took her production company, and set off for the Tirol She acquired a farmhouse at the foot of the Wilder Kaiser mountain near Kitzbühel, an idyllic refuge, in the midst of total war Here she continued to edit Tiefland, right to the final days of the war Obsessed with her work, she can hardly to have heard the allied bombers flying over daily on their way to Berlin At what point was her image of Hitler shattered? My image of Hitler was shattered much too late Right at the end of the war When I saw he wasn't visiting the bombed cities... ...and seeing the misery for himself And that he even recruited old people and children for the 'Volkssturm'... ...I was appalled. His image was totally shattered When did you last see Hitler? After my war-marriage, which was on 21st March, 1944 My husband and I were invited... ...to the Berghof That was the last time He was very distracted and kept up a continual monologue He no longer seemed like a man in touch with reality, more like a ghost The final battle for Berlin By the beginning of 1945, it was all over for Germany The country lay in ruins First French and then American troops marched into the Tirol And Riefenstahl was arrested in Kitzbühel It was a time that beggars description So sad, so dreadful. All our ideals were shattered One just could not comprehend it all It was a terrible fall into the abyss It was only when I was interrogated by the Americans in Dachau... ...that I saw pictures of the camps I'd never seen any pictures or heard anything about them It was such a terrible shock I couldn't believe... ...human beings could do such things And these things had been done on Hitler's orders It was quite a time before I could believe it And, when I did, my life fell apart because I'd believed in Hitler It was so shattering... ...that one's own life seemed utterly unimportant There were only two possibilities Either to live with this appalling burden of guild weighing us down... ...or to die It was a constant dilemma, to live or to die This bloody struggle had so far caused 60 million human lives in Europe alone After you discovered the crimes of the Third Reich... ...did you look on your work differently? No. I was just appalled and confused to have lived through that period I did look at it differently... ...to the extent that I put myself into the minds of the victims How awful for them to see those swastikas, the SS men and the SA - ...people we'd never thought of as criminals It was a breakdown that's actually been permanent I've never recovered from the horror People say of me: "She's blind. She doesn't want to know "She'll always be a Nazi" But none of this applied to me I was never a Nazi, so I can't be one still I condemn all that happened but it doesn't help. They don't believe me At the denazification trial in Freiburg, Leni Riefenstahl's connection with the National Socialists was scrutinized closely Most of the witnesses who testified at the trial are still alive and continue to confirm the statements they made then Riefenstahl's trial attracted huge attention from the world's press Finally the court declared that she couldn't be condemned as a Nazi but classed as a sympathizer The judges found no political activity in support of the Nazi regime that would justify punishment There were many however, who remembered Riefenstahl's prominent position in the Third Reich and were unhappy with the verdict Character assassination is all too easy I've been attached countless times The most incredible things have been said about me For instance, that I was Hitler's mistress, his lover... Goebbel's lover, or Goering's - or of all of them That I'd used gypsies from a concentration camp for a film... ...which I never did All this was stated... ...to try and finish me and ensure I never worked again After the war, for over 20 years, Riefenstahl lived alone with her mother in an attic in Munich She was never to make another film Despite this, she still receives fanmails from all over the world For in the 1960s, she made a well publicized comeback In her travels she had discovered a new continent and a fresh inspiration in Africa In 1962, Riefenstahl travelled to the southern Sudan to visit the Nuba a remote community of around a 100 tribes who'd had a little contact with the outside world Her love of Africa had begun some years earlier, when she visited Kenya to make a film about the modern day slave trade The film was called Black Cargo, and was never finished On her way back to Nairobi, Riefenstahl was involved in a major car crash and nearly killed It was a grave setback, but she never lost her passion for the dark continent Her first book of photographs of the Nuba was published in 1973 How did your fascination with the Nuba begin? With a photo An ordinary photo that I happened to see in an old issue of 'Stern'... ...when I was lying in hospital in Nairobi, after a car accident This photo, which I always keep on my desk... ...where I'm working with the Nuba, had changed my life It shows two wrestlers... Nubas, just what I wanted for my film 'Black Cargo' I needed men like that but in Kenya and Tanzania I couldn't find any The Masai were slim and graceful... ...but black athletes of the kind I needed weren't to be found So I went looking for them At the age of 60, Riefenstahl went to live alone with the Nuba for eight months This is the little bed where I slept for months... ...with hundreds of wild dogs around me Strangely enough, I was happy Wrestlers from different tribes assembled to play for a wrestling festival Funded by a friend, August Arnold, who ran a camera company in Munich, Riefenstahl took both photographs and film footage of the Nuba during his stay Her Nuba footage has never been shown publicly before But it was her Nuba photographs that brought her back to prominence The photos weren't so important. I went there to get to know the people But, as always when I'm travelling, I took a few shots Whatever appealed to me - their lifestyle, the way they moved... ...their physical types, their faces, their rituals I never thought I'd publish the results The Seraba, a herdsmen's encampment The young men would live in the Seraba encampment, cut-off from the village, and prepare themselves for the traditional wrestling contests The adolescents go through an initiation rite Only then can they take part in the wrestling As a mark of their membership of the Seraba, the young men cover themselves with ash and paint their bodies The ash has a ritual significance. It is meant to give them strength and beauty The Nuba were strange beings to me I'd never met native Africans before They surprised me by their character They were poor They only had their land and a little water but they were happy They weren't suspicious. We soon got to know each other using a few words They were so warm and cheerful It made me think "How little one needs to be happy" I've often been back and I've always felt at ease there Over 3000 metres of film footage of the Nuba is stored in Leni Riefenstahl's basement But the film about the Nuba, a pet project for so many years has never been completed It is true that some important material was destroyed during processing But what prevents such an enthusiastic editor from cutting her own work Just before setting off on her second Nuba expedition Riefenstahl was to have a decisive encounter She met Horst Kettner, 40 years her junior, he nevertheless became her companion working and travelling with her as he still does today For the next Nuba expedition, Riefenstahl would be better equipped Horst would be her cameraman She had trained him herself in the course of her travels A wrestling festival among the Masaki Nuba These Masaki Nuba wrestling festivals begin after first harvest in November and last until the end of March The contests never end brutally The wrestler who throws his opponent on his back wins There is a referee to oversee the fair play A 160 miles away, is another tribe with very different customs and language These are the Nuba of Kao. They're Nuba too but quite different Their nature is quite unlike the Masaki Nuba They're wild. Not as peaceable as the other Nuba It's difficult to work with them but worth the effort They're artists More gifted than any other tribe I've seen They paint wonderful masks Each one more interesting than the last And they do them in just 20-30 minutes What are they for? Purely to beautify themselves. It's just decoration There's a ritual symbolism to the signs found on many of them For instance... ...some have exaggerated their eyes They want to make their eyes seem larger And on others the lines are stylised representations... ...of gazelles and other animals they know It's amazing. Every mask is different I'm more attracted by an aesthetic subject than by an ugly one I can't be creative with a negative subject I only become creative and have ideas... ...when dealing with something which stimulated my enthusiasm That's been true of all my films A dance ceremony of the Nuba of Kao These ceremonies take place after the traditional knife contests Only virgins are allowed to dance The girls woo the fighters with their dancing According to an American anthropologist the Nuba consider their own bodies as the highest form of art It's not just the masks of these Nuba that are interesting... ...but also their hair decorations Here you see, for example, this notch in the hair And here too. That means he's a Kaduma - they're the only men... ...allowed to fight Comparing her famous Nuba photographs with the massive film footage, it is easier to understand why her promised Nuba film never materialized Working without a professional cameraman and unable to dictate and influence all the actions, Riefenstahl, the obsessive perfectionist couldn't be in total control of the material and could not reach the aesthetic heights to which she aspired You mean Susan Sontag? It's a mystery to me... ...how such an intelligent woman can talk such rubbish I took these pictures... ...of the Nuba, just as they live, unobserved, without posing What can be fascist about that? I don't understand Her involvement with the Nuba led once again to doubts about her intentions and questions of her aesthetics The cult of the body beautiful The celebration of masculine power and strength Riefenstahl had heard these reproaches before It's a lot of rubbish If you're living among such natural people and carry a camera... ...and they don't want to be photographed... ...you can still take shots because they get to know you But what has that got to do with Strength and Beauty? I've not changed these people They're very healthy human beings. There's no sickness in the tribe The old people sit in dark houses, in shadow, so you can't film them Those who walk about outside are mainly young, healthy Many also happen to be beautiful But I didn't create them. God did Have you ever thought how one might define a fascist aesthetic? I don't understand the question. I've no concept of fascism... ...unless it be the Hitler salute... ...or the fascist salute with the raised right hand - I can't imagine anything - No visual aesthetic? No, I've no idea what that might mean In the 1970s, Riefenstahl discovered another refuge far from the madding crowd, underwater Horst, could you kindly bring me the reel with the sharks in close-up? We've a shot somewhere of Herbert... ...with a fish in his mouth and the shark snatching it I'd like that shot I think it's in Reel 3. I'll fetch it for you Please, it's important At the age of 70, Riefenstahl passed her scuba diving test In order to be allowed to take the test at all, she had to claim to be only 50 Since then, she has dived with Horst in some of the world's most spectacular underwater locations She trained Horst to be her cameraman Horst uses an underwater video camera that is protected by a casing designed by himself They are now working on an ambitious underwater epic that would probably prove to be their last How long can we stay underwater? - Twenty minutes maximum - We'll need to shoot all the scenes As always, Riefenstahl takes stills and supervises the lighting while Horst operates the camera At the age of 90, Riefenstahl is probably the oldest diver in the world Her increasing concern about the threat to marine life has led her to become a member of Greenpeace Give me the mouthpiece - There's no air in it - Yes, look It was great The 'crown of thorns' we filmed today was good But you didn't hold the camera steady I was being pushed by the current The visibility is very poor We should really shoot it again - There was too much plankton - That's quite good Well done. That's a good shot I tried a bit of side-lighting But you kept telling me to take the lamp away I meant the one with the blue filter I see. You wanted the red That's very good. I like that very much This is too dark, as if you had under-exposed it - That was deliberate - Why deliberate? It was too dark Now that's a good shot Diving up a depth of a 100 ft. they encounter a giant stingray One touch of its tail would be lethal That's really fantastic. We were so lucky In 18 years' diving, we've never had that We've never had it before Is that the first or the second? That's the big one eating From great mountain heights and worldwide fame Riefenstahl has descended in the twilight years of her life to a silent world It is no longer the noble human form that preoccupies her but the exotic marine life of the underwater kingdom Underwater, far from the public gaze is where she is happiest But, even here she cannot escape the long shadows cast by her past I feel this country... ...is still waiting for you to say publicly: "I made a mistake. I'm sorry" Being sorry isn't nearly enough But I can't tear myself apart or destroy myself It's so terrible. I've suffered anyway for over half a century And it will never end, until I die It's such an incredible burden, that to say sorry... It's inadequate, it expresses too little Doesn't it hurt to read again and again that you're irredeemable? Of course it hurts. It makes me very, very sad But because it never stops and people keep on saying it... ...I have to live with it It casts such a shadow over my life... ...that death will be a blessed release I feel people are expecting... ...an admission of guilt from you Well, what do you mean by that? What am I guilty of? I can and do regret making the film of the 1934 Party Congress... ...'Triumph of the Will' I regret... no, I can't regret that I was alive in that period But no words of anti-semitism ever passed my lips. Nor did I write any I was never anti-semitic and I never joined the Nazi Party So what am I guilty of? Tell me that I didn't drop any atom bombs. I didn't denounce anyone So where does my guilt lie?
