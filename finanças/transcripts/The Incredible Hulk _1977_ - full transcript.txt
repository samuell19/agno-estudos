(INAUDIBLE) (TIRES SCREECHING) (SCREAMING) (GASPS) This is it? That's it. (SIGHING) Oh, good grief. I carry this around for a while, I can give up my exercise classes. Why don't you give them up anyway? I think you look terrific, Dr. Marks. Oh, Jerry, I always knew I liked you. Hey, why don't you run away with me to Acapulco? How about someplace more exotic? Casablanca? Well... The Mayo Clinic. Now you're talking. Oh, Jerry, you've been here too long. Too long. (SIGHS) Hi, Angie, how are you? Oh, Ben. Hi. Ben, hi, listen. What happened to the adrenal scans and the synapse tests? Not back yet. I heard the myoglobin analysis was... The myoglobin analysis is here. Looks thorough. (CHUCKLES) A reporter named Jack McGee called. Yeah, he's from The National Register. He wants to interview us. Oh. National Register is not exactly The Washington Post. No, not exactly. That's why we've been ducking him. Listen, would you do me a favor? If you see David, would you tell him... There's David, there. Oh, thanks. Good morning. Hi. Well, we got the myoglobin analysis back. I'll tell you, I think that computer oughta run for Congress. You ask it a simple question, gives you back a 10-pound answer takes you a month to decipher. Yeah. (MACHINES HUMMING) Dreaming again? Bad as before? Yeah. Thinking of going back to the shrink? Oh, what's the use? The doctor said I should expect the dreams to recur every now and then. Yeah, but they were better for a while. It's been almost a year. Eleven months tomorrow. WOMAN: (ON INTERCOM) Dr. Marks? Yes, Liz. Mrs. Jesse Maier and her son are here for you. Okay. Would you tell them I'll be right out? Thank you. David. Look, I think we should put this particular interview off for today? No, no, we're going to do it. So, why don't you bring them in while I go buy a donut? Why don't I go bring them in while you go buy a donut. Hey, you want anything? I'll bring you a surprise. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Mrs. Maier? Oh, yes. Hi, I'm Elaina Marks. And this is Bernard? BJ. Oops, BJ! He doesn't like Bernard. Well, BJ it is. How are you? Put it there. Well, would you guys come with me, please? Uh-huh. Good. Here we go. What do you do here? Am I gonna get a shot? Hush now, BJ. Oh, come on now, BJ, would I do that to you? Then what's all this stuff for? Well, I'll tell you. Now, this is our research laboratory. And what we're trying to figure out here is just how strong the human body can be. Hey, my mama's real strong. Once she saved my life. Yes, I know, and that's what we want to talk to you about. As I told you on the phone, Mrs. Maier, what we're trying to learn is how to tap into that really incredible reserve of human strength that all of us have, and only use about 20% of. You mean I'm stronger than I think I am? Oh, are you kidding? You're much... Come on over here. Excuse us. Gonna do a little experiment on you. Get you up here. (GRUNTS) There we go. I'm not so strong. Here. Now, you see this little muscle right here? This guy that makes the foot wiggle back and forth. Well, now that little muscle can take about 1000 pounds of pressure on it. Wow! Yeah, wow is right. And your bones, your bones are much stronger than you think, too. But bones break. Yeah, bones break. But, so do eggshells, right? Right. Okay, I'm gonna show you something. I just happen to have a little old egg here. Now, will you stick your hands together? That's right. Now, I want you to squeeze it on the ends as hard as you can. It'll be all yucky. No, it won't. Have a little faith in me. Go ahead. Hey, I can't break it! See, I told you. Oh, it's some kind of a special egg. No, it isn't. Things can be a lot stronger than they look. It's a real egg. Crack it. That's it. You see, but it was a lot stronger than you thought. Right? Lost another egg, huh? Uh-huh. Mrs. Maier, BJ, this is Dr. David Banner. Hi, Mrs. Maier, how are you? BJ. Hi. Look, there was only one donut down at the shop so what do you say we split it four ways? Yeah. Oh, no, not me, thank you. You guys have it. Okay. I certainly don't need that. There you go, my friend. Now, if you'd hop down from there and go into that room round to the right, Mrs. Maier, we'll be right in for the interview. All right, Doctor. ELAINA: And what was your weight at the time? Oh, it was about 110 pounds. Oh! Wish I could keep mine at that. All right, now, Mrs. Maier, if you'd just tell us your story in your own words. Well, I was driving to Columbus, Ohio, to see my sister, Katy. And BJ was sitting on the passenger side, playing with his car as usual. But, he did have his seat belt on. MRS. MAIER: There wasn't much traffic. I was going about 50, I think. I just glanced over at BJ just before it happened. (SCREECHING) (STAMMERING) The tire had blown out. It was the left front tire. It tore the wheel so hard that it just came right out of my hands. And the car swerved across the road there, and they said the front wheel dug into the dirt and it started to roll. Then it rolled, it rolled over. It kept on rolling. I thought it was never gonna stop. I guess the door, it sprung open, 'cause all of a sudden, I was just right there on the ground. The car was turned over, to one... You know, sort of on its top, to one side like that. Then the fire started up, and I... And I knew that I had to get BJ out of there. And what happened then? Well, then I went over to the car, and there were flames, like, all over (STAMMERING) the top of the... I'm sorry, I mean the bottom of the car there. And... That's where they figure that my... Excuse me, where my face got burned at that... At that time. I don't remember. All I knew is that I had to get him out of there. But you see, the door of the car was pinned down by the weight of the car. But, I tried and I tried to pull that door open. I have to tell you, I was just really frantic. But, I just... I just couldn't do it. Yes, you did, Mom. Tell them. Well, BJ, I don't know. I don't know exactly how it happened. The fire was spreading. And I do know that it was gonna explode real soon. So, I thought to myself, I said, if I could raise up the car, I thought then I could open up the door. So, I put my hand, you know, under something, and then I just... I just tried to lift it. It was the hardest thing I ever did. But I was furious at the thought of BJ dying inside. Then it happened. Somehow, I was lifting up the car. I was lifting up the car. It started to move, real slowly, but I kept lifting and lifting. I don't... I don't know where I got the strength. I don't know where it came from. But there it was. I don't... I don't know. And I... That's all. And I got him out. Now, according to my calculations, the weight was later found to be in excess of 1200 pounds. I... Excuse me, Mrs. Maier. ELAINA: David? David. Where did she find that strength, Elaina? 110 pound women don't just lift up a half-ton car. Now, where did that come from? I don't know. But if she tapped into it, it's got to be there. But how could she find the strength and I couldn't? You heard her story. My God, that's exactly what happened to me. Except that her son is alive and Laura is dead! And in every other case that we've researched, it's been the same story over and over and over again. But what is the common denominator? David, believe me, if I knew the answer, I'd tell you. I know. I'm sorry. I really think you should give up this research for a while. No. I warned you when we went into this. I felt you were too close to it. Because of what happened to Laura. And I've watched it eat away at you for the last 10 months. And now it's starting to affect your work. Work? How can you hope to examine a medical phenomenon with cool scientific objectivity... If I keep losing my cool. You know, my mother always used to tell me getting angry doesn't help. Well, I always liked your mother. She always liked you. I'm gonna help you with these. As always. Do you think we will ever find where that strength comes from? I don't know. But we'll certainly share a lot of donuts together, and I'll probably get fat. Shall we get back to work, Doctor? You got it, Doctor. (BEEPING) ELAINA: Had you ever displayed any excessive strength before? EPSTEIN: Oh, no. I used to get tired just doing my ironing. As a matter of fact, that's what I was doing when the earthquake hit. And then the ceiling collapsed? I was pinned under one of those steel beams. Then what? I started to smell the gas. That's a smell you don't forget. I really got frantic. My parents had died that way in Germany. I guess I really got frantic. I wasn't going to let that happen to me. So, I put my hands on the beam that was across me. And somehow, I bent that steel beam and got out. (RATTLING) BRAM: The smoke was getting thicker, and the people was right behind me. Some of them was screaming. And we got to this here fire door. It was jammed. So I was pounding on it, but you couldn't hear nothing over the fire. And I said to myself, "We're gonna die." And I was so doggone mad that I had gotten them this far and couldn't get out. So I started kicking at it. The fire door? Yeah. DAVID: And then what happened, Mr. Bram? Well, I kicked the sucker down. That was a very heavy door, wasn't it? Firemen told me it would take a battering ram to get it open. Then how did you do it? By the grace of God. And all of a sudden we were ambushed. I mean, VC all over the place. I saw a buddy of mine go down at the top of the hill. The same friend that had saved your life in Danang. Yes, sir. And I wasn't about to leave him face down in the mud in that hellhole. DAVID: So, you went after him through all that enemy fire. I don't really remember that part of it. I just remember I was determined to get Johnny out of there. You don't remember being wounded? No, sir. I was kind of busy. ELAINA: And just how many bullets were taken out of you? Seventeen, ma'am. I... I spoke with the medevac that flew you out of there. He said what you did was physically impossible. I guess he was wrong. MAN: Dr. Banner? Yes. I'm Jack McGee, from The National Register. Excuse me. I was hoping I'd be able to get an interview with you. No, thank you. Oh, come on, Doctor, this research that you're doing gets people right where they live. Everybody would like to know how to tap into their hidden strengths. Surely you can tell me something about that. No. I'm sorry. Why not? My newspaper's very interested. Mr. McGee. Your newspaper is only interested in reporting murder, rape, horoscopes, UFOs and Farrah Fawcett. I don't happen to fit into any of those categories, and I wish not to be interviewed. All right, Dr. Banner. But I don't give up easily. DAVID: Come on, you little buggers, do something exciting. So, Mrs. Maier's blood structure is just like all the others we've examined, huh? It is annoying. What made all these people so strong? The only thing they had in common was extreme emotional commitment. But there has to be a physical explanation. David, maybe we should go further. Right into the cellular structure itself. You mean the mitochondria? Yeah. I mean they are responsible for converting fat and sugar derivatives into energy. Yes? Uh-huh. Possible. We'll take a look under the electron microscope. Come on. All right. ELAINA: One tiny portion of a living cell. Well, I'll tell you, as many times as I've seen it, it still fascinates me that it would take over a half a million of those to cover the head of a pin. Well, enjoy the view, that's all we've got. Nothing abnormal on the computer scan? No, no. The mitochondria in Mrs. Maier's cells are like all the others. Textbook normal, but nothing to indicate any reason or sort of extraordinary strength. Maybe we should go deeper still. Into the nucleus of the cell? To the DNA. We have nothing left to examine. You know, Ben's been souping up a lot of our equipment in higher power. Did he happen to modify this particular unit for a higher magnification? Well, I know it's set at 200,000. Yeah, he has a tape mark here for... 1,000,000? Let's see what we can see. DAVID: The ultimate building block of life. David, there's something here. (BLEEPING) What? There's an abnormal concentration of the adenine-thymine combination. (EXCLAIMS) DAVID: Okay. Okay. Now, let's take a look at Mr. Bram's DNA structure. Anything? Yes, Mr. Bram has it, too. Uh-huh. Elaina, we may have found it. All 78 cases. All of them have the same DNA deviation. Yeah, but how does it work, David? How did it make them unnaturally strong? Oh, one thing at a time, Dr. Marks. At least we know they're different from me. No, we don't. What? When was the last time you had your DNA magnified a million times? DAVID: It's impossible. ELAINA: The same variant in your DNA. Even more than most of the others. But, Elaina, it can't be. I never found the strength that they did. No, there must be some ingredient missing. Something external operating. But what? David, we've got a problem with the microwave transmission from Pittsburgh. It may be a while before we can get that DNA data you wanted. How long a delay? Well, it's hard to figure. We've got some heavy duty gamma ray interference. Could be a sunspot kicking up or something. We'll try again tomorrow. Thanks, Ben. Right. ELAINA: No, there must be some ingredient missing. Something external operating. Something external operating. Now, this represents all the gamma ray interference for the past year, right? Yeah, the peaks show maximum interference, the dates are up here at the top. Gamma rays have been known to interfere with biological activity, haven't they? I don't know. I'm sure they have. I'm sure they have. Ben, look, can I borrow this for a while? Sure, be my guest. Mrs. Maier. Mrs. Epstein. Mr. Bram. High gamma each time. What about me? Low. Low. Come on, Elaina. Come on. Come on. Come on. Gamma. (GRUNTING) 300,000. (TIMER BEEPING) (GRUNTING) DAVID: Where did she find that strength? MRS. MAIER: I lifted the car. (CHUCKLING) That's all. DAVID: How could she find the strength and I couldn't? What made all these people so strong? Oh, terrific. (ENGINE FALTERING) Come on, you stupid. ELAINA: No, there must be some ingredient missing. DAVID: But what? MR. BRAM: Well, I kicked the sucker down. EPSTEIN: I bent that steel beam. MRS. MAIER: I was lifting up the car. (THUNDER CRASHING) MRS. MAIER: I lifted the car. DAVID: What is the common denominator? (TIRE EXPLODES) (TIRES SCREECHING) Come on. (TOOLS CLANGING) (GRUNTING) Come on out of there! (GRUNTING) (YELLS IN PAIN) (SCREAMING) (GROWLING) (SNARLING) (GROWLING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Get on there. Come on, get on. Come on. Whoa. Stay there. Get away from me! Daddy! Daddy, help! No! Stay away! Help me! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Daddy! No! Get away! Help me! Help! (SUSIE CRYING) Help! Help! Daddy! Daddy! Help! Daddy! (SUSIE SPUTTERING) No, get away! Help! Help! Get away! Daddy, help! Susie! What's wrong? Susie! Hey, get away from there! Daddy, help! Get the hell away from my daughter! MAN: Did you hear me? Now, get away! Get away from her! (GROWLING) Look out, Daddy! Daddy! Oh, Daddy, look out! Look out, Daddy! (SCREAMING) (ROARING) Daddy! I'm all right, honey. Are you all right? Yeah, I guess. My God. My God. (SHOWER RUNNING) (ELAINA HUMMING) (DOORBELL RINGS) Oh, great. (SIGHING) Timing is everything. (DOORBELL RINGS) (DOORBELL RINGING REPEATEDLY) All right, all right, all right. David. Oh, my God. (GROANING) Elaina. David! Easy, easy. What happened to you? (PANTING) Easy, easy. Easy. I'm not sure. Oh, my God, what happened to your arm? I don't know. Please, sit down. Sit down. What happened to your arm? (GROANS) Let me see. There was a bullet. I guess it went through. Oh, yeah, put this on it. Bullet? Yeah. Who shot you? I don't know. (SIGHS) All right, but we're gonna get you to a hospital. DAVID: Oh, wait. I'm okay. Oh, sure you are. Elaina, please. I can't go to the hospital. Why not? It might be dangerous. Just let me figure out what's happened to me, please. All right. All right. But first we have to take care of that wound. I don't understand. Why would anyone wanna shoot you? (SIGHING) I don't know. Did you save the bullet? No, why? Well, might be nice to have something to bite on. Hold on. (EXCLAIMG IN PAIN) Okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay, here we are. David. Yeah. When did you say you were shot? I don't know. Some time early this morning. Well, I'll tell you, this wound looks like it's been healing for about three days. I don't know. I mean, there's scar tissue formed over it. It's almost as if your body were working faster than usual. Yeah. Very strange. This whole thing has been very strange. What did happen? Last night after you left, I hit on it. Or at least I thought I did. Hit what? The external force operating in conjunction with the DNA to make all those people strong. It's the gamma ray. The gamma ray? Yeah. I matched up a graph of excessive gamma activity from sunspots to each incident of supernormal strength. In every case they matched. And when you and Laura had the accident it was... Low gamma activity. I've gotta get something to drink. I'm dehydrating. But that doesn't explain why you look like this? I went to radiology and I took a gamma injection. I tried to call you, but you weren't here, and I was anxious. Uh-huh. Overanxious. How much did you take? I went all the way and I took 300,000 units. Oh, David! Only for 15 seconds. And nothing happened. Oh, really? Well, at least not at first. I was driving home. I had a... I had a flat tire. I was changing it. Yes? And then it was morning. I was standing in the woods like this. What happened in between? There was... Someone... Something. Something else. Something awful. What? David, try to remember. I... I remember feeling incredibly strong. It was me and it wasn't me. (STUTTERING) I... My eyes were white. What? My eyes were white. David, how do you feel now? (SIGHING) Normal. My arm, it's sore. I'm incredibly thirsty. I'm not crazy. Whatever happened... All right. All right, look, I think what we should do is get down to the lab, do a couple of tests on you, try to figure out what did happen. And what you might have done that would cause someone to wanna shoot at you. Okay. The Southwest Lab, is anybody there? I don't think so, why? I think it might be better if we... If we go there. You know, it's so isolated. In case. Afraid? Little. Look, let me throw on some clothes, then we can go pick up some things for you. (DOORBELL RINGING) Then... (WHISPERING) Um, why don't you... Dr. Marks? I'm Jack McGee. We spoke on the phone. Yes, Mr. McGee, and I told you we're not granting any interviews. Well, maybe I could change your mind if you'd let me come in for a minute. I'm afraid not. To be quite honest with you, I don't particularly like your newspaper or its reputation. Yeah, well, yeah, reputation's a very important thing. I won't bother you since you're otherwise involved. Good day, Mr. McGee. Some other time? The hyperbaric chamber's working? Yeah. DeBakey and Steve Frankel just finished some depressurization testing for SEALAB. I'm glad it's here. What do you mean? Well, whatever happened to me before might happen again. And if it does, both of us might be safer if I'm in there. How you doing? Okay. Thirsty. Well, I got some stuff here. Apple juice okay? That would be great. Good. Just spoke to Ben at the radiology unit. Yeah? How many units of gamma did you say you injected into yourself? 300,000. Okay. Hi. Hi. Oh, thanks. How do you know it was 300,000? I turned the calibrator up to the last click. 300,000. Little piece of white tape on it? Yeah. It's like the electronic microscope that Ben modified for higher strength. Are you saying that Ben modified the radiology unit in excess of 300,000? But there was no marking on the tape. Well, he hadn't calibrated it yet. He was gonna work on it this morning. He didn't know how high he could get it to go. Well, how high did it get? Almost two million units. I took a dose that high? Probably. I think you better lock the hatch. ELAINA: Let's do your DNA scan again, okay? David? Okay, yeah, okay. Yeah. You see it all right? Yeah. ELAINA: The adenine-thymine lock in the lower quadrant. Yeah. What do you make of it? I don't know. I don't know, but whatever it is, we're gonna get you back to normal. David, I think it's time we tried to reverse the process. Elaina. I don't know what I've blundered into, but it could be the natural outgrowth of all our research. We have to try and make it happen again, so that we can observe it here, in a laboratory situation where we can control it. David, look. I know you have feelings of enormous strength. I just feel that there are too many unknown factors here. We really do not know what we're getting ourselves into. Neither did Benjamin Franklin when he flew that kite in the thunderstorm. Right. And he could have been electrocuted. But he wasn't. He could have been. Look, I don't wanna stay in this can any longer than I have to, believe me. We can always try the x-ray reversal. But we might have found what we've been looking for. And we can't just throw it away without investigating it first. Are you being scientific about this, or are you letting your emotions run away with you again? Elaina, we've got to try. All right, what happens if we tap into this hidden strength? What happens? I don't know. I don't know! I don't know. Maybe I'll just bang around in here for a while. Look, it was built to withstand the pressure of 1000 feet below the ocean. It's made of 10-gauge chromium steel. Elaina, it's like being inside a bank vault. The glass in this port is six inches thick. (SIGHING) All right, Doctor. How do you wanna proceed? All right. All right. I'd like to reconstruct everything that happened last night. Just to see if it triggers anything. Okay? All right, it was dark. Okay. Good. All right, now, it was raining. What about the equipment in there? I've got it. There's no way I can make it rain in there. Don't worry about it. I've got an idea. Give me a second to close the inside airlock hatch. (GRUNTING) And locked. David, what are you doing in there? Creating a little rainstorm. How? There's 160 pounds of pressure behind the main water feed. I'm opening it up little. (WATER SPLASHING) Anything on the instruments? Nothing on the EEG. Well, what about the GSR? No, nothing there, either. You feel anything? No, nothing. Hey, wait a minute. Last night it was an electrical storm. Oh, brother, you really do have a Ben Franklin complex, don't you? Come on, Elaina. Come on where, David? I'm fresh out of lightning. There's nothing we can do. All right, well, supposing we were to overload the electrical main in here. Well, it'll just blow out, won't it? Well, not if I were to separate the ground connection from it. And then if we shut down all the other systems in here I think we can generate enough to create an arc. All right, shut down the power, okay? Power's off. All right, fire it up again. Power on. All right, now increase the load to the power grid a little at a time. (CRACKLING) You okay? Yeah. How's the EEG? You took a little glitch, nothing abnormal. All right, keep it up. All right, that's one hour. Still nothing, David. We'd better stop. I don't see any purpose in going on. Just a little longer. No, David. The equipment's on the edge of overheating now. I'm shutting down. What's wrong? Why won't it work? I don't know, but it doesn't. Look, why don't you dry yourself off and get some fresh clothes out of the locker, okay? Hey, I made that just like when we were in med school. Extra mayonnaise and everything. I'm just not hungry. Come on, David, we've done everything we could figure to do. Yeah, I know. Look, why don't you lie down for a while? Get some rest. What about you? Oh, I'll lie down out here in a little while. Yeah, okay. Elaina, I'm sorry about all the hassle over this. David. Look, you may be in there alone, but we're in this together, huh? As usual. As usual. Well, I guess I might as well leave my electrodes on. Couldn't hurt. Oh, yeah? When was the last time you wore them to sleep? (LAUGHS) Could you turn the light out, please? He's dreaming. (GASPING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (TIRES SCREECHING) 4:05. Dr. Banner began rapid eye movement indicating dream state. Considerable agitation and heavy increase in both GSR and EEG responses, especially the beta frequency. The GSR is also beginning to register. Apparently the dream is upsetting him. I think he's having a nightmare. (SCREAMING) The agitation is reaching an extreme level. There seems... Now there seems to be some malfunction in the EEG. Dr. Banner himself has... (GROWLING) David? (SNARLING) Oh, my God. David? David, is that you? It's 4:16. Dr. Banner is no longer in the pressure chamber. He has metamorphosized into some extraordinary creature. He has just smashed the control console. Now he's moving toward the electrical junction box. He's pounding on the steel bulkhead above it. The sound of his blows are reverberating through the inside of the chamber. He just took a direct 220-volt charge and he's apparently unhurt. (GROWLING) Oh, God. He's like some kind of a child throwing a monstrous tantrum. Now he's reaching up for the pipes. He's broken off the water pipe. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Now it's... He's reaching for the steam pipe. Two inches of steel. He's ripped that out. It's recoiling from the steam. Apparently it's hurt by it. Now... Now it's moving towards the hatch door. It's pounding on the airlock vault. It's unbelievable. The hull is three inches thick, a chromium alloy steel, and yet this creature is able to make dents in it by using both hands together. (GROWLING) But it's holding. He's still contained inside the inner chamber. But, now he's... Now he's trying to get through the first hatch. The locking wheel has broken off, it can't get through the hatch. (POUNDING) (SCREAMS) (ELAINA PANTING) It reached out. I don't... I don't think it was consciously after me, it was just trying to escape. Its arms are huge, and the skin has a greenish tinge. Its proportions are like those of a man, but considerably larger. It roars like an angry caged animal. God, now it's moving towards the outer hatch area. And now it's pounding on the outer hatch. I don't know how long the hatch can hold him. It's broken through the main viewing port. (GAS HISSING) It's forcing a tube valve off the wall. It's... It's being driven back by the gas. The gas is filling the airlock. It's hard to see clearly. It's again pounding. The blows don't seem to be injuring his hands. There's no... There's no blood that I can see. It seems to be driven by this blind rage to escape. It's going to. Its metabolism must be going at an extraordinary rate. Which would explain why David's wound was able to heal so quickly. Oh, no. (GROWLING) David? It's all right. Take it easy. That's it. Nobody's gonna hurt you, all right? It's okay. It's okay. That's it. Can you understand me? Can you understand me? Can you speak? Okay. Okay. Are you hurt? Are you hurt? Let me see your hands. (GASPING) Oh, it's all right. It's okay. Let me see your hands. Oh, dear. You're hurt, aren't you? All right. Stay right there. It's okay. It's okay. All right. Now, can you give me your hand? Now, I'm just gonna touch your hand a little. All right? Let me get a blood sample. Can you give me your hand? That's it. That's it. I'm not gonna hurt you. That's it. Easy. Okay. Okay. Okay, just stay right there. You're all right. You're all right. All right. All right. Come with me. Can you come with me? That's it. Come on. Come on, sit down. Over here, come on. It's okay. That's it. That's it. Sit down. That's it. You're okay now. You're okay. You're okay. Elaina? It's all right. It's all right, David, just... Just rest easy. You're back now. DAVID: You're a very brave woman, Elaina. ELAINA: I was a very scared woman. The blood sample is just normal now. What caused it? I mean, I was sleeping. You were dreaming. What? Yeah, look at the EEG. The REM indicator. I watched you. You were tossing, turning, frowning. I don't remember. Try, try. It might help us to understand. I don't. Was it the accident? Yes. Yes, that was it. Laura and I were driving, there was the accident. She was trapped in the car. Now, did you feel anything? Oh, the same thing I always feel every time I have the dream. Outrage. Frustration at not being able to save her. Extreme... anger. What is it? Anger. Elaina, I was angry and upset. And last night I was angry, too. I left the lab, I was so... I was so totally frustrated because of our... Our failure with the research. And then there was the rain, the storm, the flat tire. And when I blacked out, I remember I was furious. All right. Now, we know that extreme emotional commitment, anger, frustration, whatever, was present in all of those people that we interviewed, right? Yeah, but I don't... No, David, it makes sense. Look. Look at the EEG. Here's the agitation you experienced in the dream. Right? Just at the moment of metamorphosis. Now, look at these lines, the intelligence level drops, the primitive emotions take over the brain and the body. And that is just what this creature is like. It's like a primitive. It's like a childish subhuman. But what made me physically change? I don't know. It might be a result of the high intensity gamma injection you took on your DNA. That's not possible. David, believe me, we saw it happen. I saw it happen, and we've seen the results of it. Now, it must be your anger that triggers it off. That means it's uncontrollable. If it can happen anytime I'm asleep, whenever my anger mounts up, even in my unconscious. When the metamorphosis happens, I haven't got any control over it, I don't even know what it does. I might have killed you. No, David. Maybe that's why I was wounded. Maybe I tried to kill somebody last night. Maybe I did kill somebody. Listen to me, David. David Banner is not a killer. We're not talking about David Banner. Yes, we are. Now, it's the same thing as if someone is under hypnosis. Unless they are a potential killer you cannot hypnotize them and make them kill. Now this... This creature is an outgrowth of David Banner. It's his... It's his primitive emotions run wild. It may be undisciplined, it may tear the hell out of a pressure chamber, but it won't kill because David Banner won't kill. All right. All right. But how can I control it? It isn't even safe to study. How can we keep it from ever happening again? I don't know. Certainly try x-ray reversal. Radiological treatment to try to counteract the gamma rays. SCOTTY: (ON INTERCOM) Dr. Banner, this is Scotty. Are you up there? What is it, Scotty? Some policemen are here at the main gate and they'd like to see you right away. Dr. Banner? Doctor? Yeah, Scotty, tell them to drive up here, will you, please? Will do, sir. Dr. Banner? David Banner? Yes. Dr. Banner, at noon today we found an automobile registered to you overturned on the north side of Crossway Road. Now, apparently the car crashed and burned. You know anything about this? No. (STUTTERING) My car was missing this morning, but... Was anybody hurt? No, not as far as we know. Did you report it missing? No. You see, I thought a friend had taken it. He has a key. Your friend wouldn't take a shoe about this size, would he, Doctor? What's that? That's a plaster cast of a footprint they found near the car. There were many of them in the mud. Mr. McGee, we have no authoritative proof that those footprints are real. And we do not want to start a panic around here. Oh, it's real all right. There's a lot more just like it down by the lake. So you have no knowledge of how your car got to where we found it? No. No, I don't. All right. You have 24 hours to arrange to have the debris cleared. After that, the Highway Patrol will take care of it and you will be billed for it. I understand, thank you. There's a girl and her father over at the lake who say that they saw the thing that made this. Did they? Well, what was it? Bigfoot? Sounded more like the Jolly Green Giant. Only I wouldn't call him too jolly. Big hulk, about seven feet tall, greenish tinge to the skin. Pretty mean-looking. Scared the daylights out of the girl. She almost drowned trying to swim out of there. Her old man shot the thing in the shoulder. Then what happened? Well, as he tells it, the creature turned on him, busted his gun, and then picked the man up and threw him an estimated 30 yards into the lake. But neither the little girl nor the father was hurt? No. Are you sure that you don't know a little something about this? I mean, that hulk's footprint was found near your car. No, I don't. Well, listen, since we're all together, why don't we go inside and talk it over. No. Mr. McGee, have you been inoculated for tubercle bacilli? Come again? Well, you see, we have a live germ culture incubating inside. I mean, you're perfectly welcome to come in. It's just that you probably wouldn't walk out again. Ooh, mean little devils, huh? Okay, we take a rain check on that one. But, Doctor, anytime you feel an interview coming on, you... You get in touch, will you? DAVID: At least we know where the bullet wound came from. Right, and we have further proof that the creature won't kill. Hasn't killed. Won't kill. David. Look, that man at the lake shot at it. Shot at you. And all it did was break his rifle and throw him in the lake. It won't kill. You won't kill. Otherwise, surely it would have killed that man. Yes? All right. But I wanna make sure that that never happens again. I wanna be Dr. Banner, not Dr. Jekyll. All right. Look, we'll try x-ray therapy as soon as Ben and the others leave the lab tonight. What if it doesn't work? Then we'll keep on searching until we find out how to make you normal again. (SIGHING) You're sure Ben didn't just go out for a little while? No, he left for the evening. Okay, good. Well, now, no little bacteria did that. I'll crank it up to 200 rads. Then we'll do your DNA scan. That should give us an indication of whether the therapy will work or not. Okay, ready? Yes. Here we go. Three, two, one. Begin. (SHRILL BLEEPING) No change. Well, now, I'm not sure... Oh, come on, Elaina. That's wishful thinking. The x-ray treatment didn't help. It didn't help. Hey. Do us both a favor. Don't get mad, huh? Look, I suggest that we get our research materials together and we move to safer quarters. Where? I don't know. I don't know. Let's just go back to the lab and we'll think of some place. (CAR APPRAOCHING) ELAINA: Plutonium storage vault? DAVID: Yeah. It's on the edge of the Institute's property. It was built to store plutonium for an atomic power project they did here a few years ago. And there's a vault there? Oh, you better believe it. The walls are made of lead, then steel, then concrete, four feet thick. Wow. So if our friend does come back, he'll never get out of there. Well, that sounds like just what the doctor ordered. Oh, dear, what about this place? If anyone should see this... That's easy. We can arrange for an accidental radiation spill. Oh, good. Just enough contamination to close the place down for a while. You got it. Oh, we need some more EEG paper. I'll get it. Good evening. How would you like to find yourself arrested? Good idea. Call the cops. I'm dying to hear you explain that. It's a pressurization test, Mr. McGee. It exploded. I don't buy it. I heard you talking about your friend coming back. You didn't sound too thrilled about it. Now, admit it, Doctor. You know something about that big hulking creature that's been attacking people, don't you? No. McGEE: Oh, come on, Doctor. Now, don't play games. You want to explain that big, wet footprint to me? It's a water spill. Oh, really? What happened to that culture of bacteria you said you had in here? Fortunately for you, we took it back to the main lab. What a coincidence. Yes, wasn't it? Will you excuse us, Mr. McGee? This institute is private property. Doctor, if you know anything about this creature, it is your duty to report that to the police. You're letting your imagination run away with you. Now, I have never seen this creature that you're talking about. Forgive me, Doctor, but I am calling you a liar. Mr. McGee. Mr. McGee, don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry. (ACID BUBBLING) David! (ELAINA SCREAMING) (EXPLOSION) (ELAINA SCREAMING) Elaina! My God, Elaina! (EXPLOSION) Elaina! Elaina! Elaina! Elaina! DAVID: My God! Elaina! Elaina! (HULK GROWLING) (ROARING) (ELECTRIC BUZZING) Banner! Banner! My God, Banner! (MOANING) (COUGHS) David. (PANTING) David. David. David. Oh, God. My poor David. (SIGHS) Who will take care of you now? (GROANING FAINTLY) It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. I don't know if you can understand me, but I want you to know something. Dear David, I have loved you for such a very long time. And I always will. And I always will. (ROARING) MINISTER: The Lord bless thee, and keep thee. The Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. Amen. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (SIGHS) You know them well? Yes, I did, Mr. McGee. Was it really necessary to print that? Well, it's the truth. It's what happened. And it sells newspapers. Look, Doctor, I saw what that creature did to a steel chamber. And I heard your friends talking. They were scared to death of it's coming back. You actually saw the thing? You're damn right I did. I gave a description to all the law enforcement agencies. They've got a warrant for murder out on it. Now, a thing that looks like that hulk is not going to stay hidden long. When they grab it, that is gonna be one of the great stories of the 20th century. One of the best. ELAINA: We'll keep on searching until we find out how to make you normal again. DAVID: I suggest that we get our research materials together and move to safer quarters. Where? I don't know. We'll think of a place. Keep on searching. We'll think of a place. I love you, Elaina. I think you loved me, too. Although you never said it.
