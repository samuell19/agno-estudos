I'VE GOT TO HAVE A LOOK AT IT. I'VE GOT TO GET A DRESSING ON IT. I'M GOING TO PAY OUR FRIEND. WHILE I'M DOING THAT, PREPARE TO CAST OFF. CAN YOU HANDLE THAT ON YOUR OWN, OR DO YOU NEED HER HELP? YOU LIED TO ME, PAUL. WHO IS THAT ASSHOLE? HE SAVED OUR ASSES BACK THERE. [MARK] HELLO! COME ON! WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR-- THE COPS? [WOMAN] UP YOURS, MARK. WE'RE ALL GOING AS FAST AS WE CAN. MAYBE IF YOU AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND WOULD GIVE US A HAND, WE'D GET AWAY QUICKER. NOT ONE OF YOU UNDERSTANDS HIS PAIN. [ALEX] FUCK HIS PAIN, AND FUCK HIM. JUST KEEP HIM BELOW. YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME. AMATEURS ARE BLUE-CHIP LIABILITIES. IF HE WANTS TO KEEP AN EYE ON IT, THAT'S HIS CALL. YOU COULD HAVE SAID NO TO HIS AIRHEAD GIRLFRIEND. NO, I COULDN'T. IT'S MY DEAL, BUT IT'S HIS INVESTMENT. LET'S GO BEFORE I LOSE ANOTHER APPENDAGE. [WOMAN] WE NEED TO GET YOU TO A HOSPITAL. YOU'RE LOSING BLOOD. [CAR HORN HONKS] WE'LL FIX IT ON BOARD. LET'S GO! STAY BACK. TARGETS ON BOARD. IF ALEX AND I HADN'T RUN INTO YOU BACK THERE-- WOULD BE SHAKING HANDS WITH SAINT PETER RIGHT NOW. ARE WE FINISHED? CAN WE GO? NO, WE'RE NOT FINISHED. I WARNED YOU. YOU FUCK WITH THE TRIADS, YOU PAY. STOP CRYING AND DRIVE THE BOAT. [WOMAN] ALEX, CHUCK ME THE BAG. YOU JUST DON'T GET IT. GIVE ME A BREAK, O.K.? WE NEED THEM. AND RACHEL WILL HOOK US UP WITH SOME BUYERS. NOW, IF WE BLOW THIS THING, THE BUSINESS GOES DOWN THE TUBES. THE BUSINESS? YOU CALL THIS A BUSINESS? THIS IS ILLEGAL AND IMMORAL, PAUL. DON'T BREAK MY BALLS. I'M LUCKY I STILL HAVE THEM. ARE WE CLEAR? [WOMAN] YEP! WE'RE CLEAR. GO. [ENGINE STARTS] LET'S PRAY FOR SOME STRONG WIND. [WOMAN] WE'RE ALL DOOMED. [WOMAN] HERE WE GO AGAIN. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE YACHT WAS OUR DESTINY. [ALEX] DESTINY? IT WAS MORE LIKE THE ACTION OF A FUCKING IDIOT. [MARK] LET'S JUST COUNT OUR BLESSINGS. A COUPLE OF SECONDS LATER, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TOAST. [WOMAN] I HAVE TO PEE. [MAN SIGHS] [COUGHS] BADLY. SO PEE. I CAN'T IN FRONT OF EVERYONE. [SIGH] WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE. [WOMAN] GREAT. ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR LITTLE PEP TALKS. ALEX... [WOMAN] I REALLY WISH YOU WOULDN'T SMOKE. [ALEX] WELL, I WISH YOU WOULDN'T BREATHE. [MARK] SHUT UP, ALEX. LEAVE HER ALONE. YOU'RE LUCKY I EVEN LET YOU ON THIS FUCKING RAFT. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. JESUS CHRIST. I WARNED THE LOT OF YOU. WHAT TYPE OF IDIOT FALLS ASLEEP IN A GALLEY WITH A LIT JOINT IN HIS HAND? I DIDN'T FALL ASLEEP. I PASSED OUT. THANKS TO YOU, THE YACHT AND 600 KILOS OF DOPE ARE SITTING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN. WE STILL HAVE THE HEROIN. GREAT. WE CAN ALL RETIRE NOW. BUT JUST TELL ME SOMETHING. WHEN IT'S CUT UP BETWEEN FOUR OF US? YOU MEAN THE SIX OF US. NO, MARK. FOUR OF US. YOU AND MISS AIRHEAD HERE HAVE BEEN VOTED OFF THE BOARD. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. I BANKROLLED THE WHOLE OPERATION. YOU ALSO SUNK THE WHOLE OPERATION. [THUMP] [WOMAN SCREAMING] THERE'S SOMETHING UNDER THE RAFT. [ALEX] GET SOMETHING HERE QUICK. [PAUL] I DON'T SEE ANYTHING. [ALEX] CAN'T DO A LOT WITH THIS. WHOA! IT'S A BODY! [ALEX] GIVE ME A HAND. GRAB HIM. TURN HIM ROUND. [PAUL] TAG. "DUNCAN JARMAN. SECURITY." WHERE DO YOU THINK HE CAME FROM? YOU THINK HE WAS DROWNED? [MARK] I THINK IT'S GREAT. MEANS THERE'S A BOAT IN THE AREA. [ALEX] I'D LIKE TO TRADE HIM FOR MARK, BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING. OH, THAT'S FUNNY. UGH! DO YOU THINK HE WAS MURDERED? OH, MY GOD. AAH! AAH! [ALEX] CHRISTINE. [MARK] CHRISSIE, RELAX! GIVE ME THE FLASHLIGHT. [WOMAN] GET OFF THE PADDLES! [MARK] HELP! COME ON! ARE YOU DEAF? HELP! COME ON! ARE YOU GUYS DEAF? HELP US OUT DOWN HERE! [MARK] HELP! [COCKS RIFLE] [MARK] COME ON, SOMEBODY-- MARK! ARE YOU DEAF? HELP! HELLO! HELP US OUT! COME ON, YOU! [PAUL] MARK. ARE YOU DEAF? WHERE ARE YOU? [CRASH] FORGET IT, MARK! THERE'S NOBODY ON LOOKOUT. [MARK] WHAT? RACHEL, RELAX. THERE HAS TO BE. [PAUL] SHUT UP, MARK. THEY CAN'T HEAR YOU. THAT MEANS ONE OF US IS GOING TO HAVE TO CLIMB UP. SO WHO'S IT GOING TO BE? I--I CAN'T CLIMB ALL THE WAY UP THERE. DON'T LOOK AT ME. DO I LOOK LIKE A DAMN LIZARD? ONLY ONE OF US HAS TO CLIMB UP THERE. AAH! [ALEX] SO YOU WANT TO DO IT, OR WHAT? LOOKS LIKE IT'S DOWN TO ME, DOESN'T IT? [CHRISTINE] WHAT THE HELL IS TAKING HIM SO LONG? [WOMAN] CALM DOWN, CHRISSIE. [MOTOR STARTS] HEY... [CHRISTINE] LOOK AT THAT. WE'RE GOING TO BE SAVED! [MUFFLED SHOUTING] [RACHEL] O.K.? [PAUL] YEAH. I GOT IT. WE NEED TO GET A BIT CLOSER. OH, CAREFUL. [RACHEL] HEY, CAREFUL, MARK. [MARK] WATCH YOUR HAND. [CHRISTINE] I'LL HOLD THE RAFT. WATCH YOUR STEP. [RACHEL] WE DID IT. [LAUGHING] [MARK] WE'RE NOT THERE YET. [PAUL] HOLD STILL. DON'T ROCK THIS THING. [CHRISTINE] OH, SHIT! [MARK] WHAT? I JUST DROPPED MY BAG. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, CHRISSIE. FORGET IT. BUY A NEW ONE. ARE YOU O.K.? YEAH. [CRASH] AHH... YEAH... [UNLOCKING DOOR] THE CAGE. GET OUT. WATCH IT. [RACHEL] ALEX! [MARK] WELL, WHERE IS EVERYBODY? [RACHEL] ALEX? [PAUL] IT'S FREEZING UP HERE. [MARK] WATCH YOUR STEP. YEAH. OH! CAREFUL. [MARK] WATCH IT! YOU O.K.? JUST TAKE IT EASY. EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. [CRASH] SCARE YOU? YEAH, REAL FUNNY. GOOD. KEEP AWAY FROM THAT EDGE. OH...JESUS. [RACHEL] YOU KNOW YOUR WAY AROUND, ALEX. I WORKED ON A RIG A COUPLE OF YEARS BACK. [MARK] DAMN. YOU BITCH, OPEN UP! SHIT. IT'S WET. EVERYONE MIND THEIR STEP. THIS WATER'S DISGUSTING. [ALEX] WATCH OUT. OH, MY. [MARK] HELLO? COOL. [PAUL] IS IT LOCKED? YEAH. WHERE IS EVERYONE? [MARK] HELLO? LET'S LOOK IN THE CANTEEN. EVERYBODY'S PROBABLY IN THERE. [CHRISTINE] LET'S FIND THE BATHROOM FIRST. I STILL HAVE TO PEE. [BEEPING] [DOORS CLOSING] WHAT IS THIS? [BEEP] [WHIRRING] STERILIZING DEVICE. [DOORS OPENING] [MARK] COR, STAR TREK. STAY CLOSE. CHRISSIE, CAN YOU TURN YOUR JACKET OFF NOW? [CHRISTINE] HELLO? "DR. CAROL SOAMES." [WOMAN] PAUL, LOOK. BRACELET. WHY WOULD SHE LEAVE EVERYTHING? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT ALL GOT CONTAMINATED. GOTCHA. HA HA HA! OH, THANKS. [RACHEL] IT'S PASSWORD PROTECTED. [CHRISTINE] LOOK! THERE'S MORE CLOTHES OVER HERE. That doesn't make sense. THIS IS A BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH UNIT. YEAH, BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THERE'S NO... NO BLOOD, NO BODIES. IT'S LIKE TMARY CELESTE. THIS IS SOME WEIRD SHIT. [COCKING RIFLE] [PAUL] HEY, ALEX. WHAT'S THE MATTER? WELL, IS THAT LOADED? DOES ME HAVING A LOADED GUN MAKE YOU NERVOUS? YEAH. YOU HAPPY? YEAH...I'M HAPPY. I THINK WE'LL ALL HAVE TO LEARN TO USE THESE. HAVE YOU USED ONE BEFORE, OR DO YOU WANT ME TO SHOW YOU? THERE. NOW YOU BOTH HAVE A TOY. YOU GUYS AND YOUR GUNS. WHAT A BUNCH OF PUSSIES. UGH. [RACHEL] DON'T PUT YOUR FINGER ON THE TRIGGER. PUT YOUR HAND HERE. DON'T HOLD THE MAG. SAFETY, SEMIAUTOMATIC, AUTOMATIC. KEEP IT ON SAFETY TILL YOU HAVE TO FIRE, O.K.? [PAUL] YEAH. PAUL? [PAUL] WHAT'S UP? AND THERE'S A CHEMICAL BREAKDOWN NEXT TO EACH ONE. UH-HUH. THAT'S HUMAN DNA. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS. WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY MAKING HERE? [RUMBLING] [PAUL] I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THEY WERE TRYING TO MAKE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY OIL. HA HA HA! IT STINKS IN HERE. [MARK] THESE CAGES MUST HAVE BEEN FOR THE ANIMALS. EXPERIMENTS! HA HA HA! YOU'RE HORRIBLE. MARK! WHAT? THAT'S A BIG FUCKING MOUSE. [WOMAN] THIS LOOKS LIKE SOME SORT OF GENETIC ENGINEERING OPERATION. WHY WOULD AN OIL COMPANY BE INVOLVED IN GENETIC ENGINEERING? THAT'S JUST IT. A SETUP LIKE THIS SHOULD NOT BE ON AN OIL PLATFORM. SO SOMEBODY WENT TO A LOT OF TROUBLE TO HIDE IT OUT HERE, THEN, RIGHT? THESE CAGES DON'T OPEN. IT'S... HEY, YOU... HEY, YOU GUYS. IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE THESE CAGES ARE-- [PAUL] WHAT? WHERE'S CHRISSIE? [PAUL] CHRIS? [WOMAN] SHE WAS HERE A MINUTE AGO. CHRIS? [WOMAN] CHRISTINE! CHRISTINE! CHRISTINE? CHRISTINE? [WHIRRING] [PAUL] WHERE IS SHE? SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAS PROBABLY HAPPENED TO HER. [RUMBLING] HOLD IT. [DOOR OPENS] HI, GUYS. WHAT'S UP? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU DON'T GO WANDERING AROUND ALONE UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. YEAH, THROUGH HERE-- REAL BATHROOMS, WITH SHOWERS, TOO. [MARK] COR. [WHIRRING] NEXT ON MY AGENDA IS FOOD. CAN WE ALL GO LOOK FOR THE KITCHEN WHEN THE OTHERS GET BACK? YEAH, BUT FIRST WE CHECK ON WHEREVER THOSE THINGS ARE MONITORED FROM THERE. THAT'S THE NERVE CENTER FOR THE WHOLE RIG. THAT'S WHERE WE'LL FIND A RADIO. PAUL. I LOST MY SUPPLY, MY KIT, AND EVERYTHING. I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU. I NEED YOU TO HELP ME OUT. WHEN I SETTLE EVERYBODY DOWN, I'LL TAKE--MARK. [INDISTINCT RADIO TRANSMISSION] [ALEX] IT'S NO GOOD. I CAN'T GET THIS RADIO TO WORK. THIS IS KIND OF SCARY. WHAT A SURPRISE. MAYBE THEY CREATED SOME KIND OF VIRUS IN THAT LAB AND IT GOT LOOSE IN THE AIR AND INFECTED EVERYONE. THEN THEY ALL WENT CRAZY WELL, YOU COME UP WITH SOMETHING BETTER. YEAH, BUT WE'RE BREATHING THE AIR, AND WE'RE O.K. BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REST OF THE BODIES? [RACHEL] SURVIVORS THREW THEM OVERBOARD. FINE, EXCEPT WE ONLY FOUND ONE BODY IN THE OCEAN, AND HE HADN'T BEEN SHOT. [ALEX] SO WHERE ARE THE OTHERS? HIDING IN THE RIG. CAN WE GO FIND THE KITCHEN NOW, PLEASE? [ALEX] YEAH... WE COLLECT EVERY SINGLE WEAPON WE CAN CARRY, O.K.? [PAUL] GIVE ME SOME CREAM IN IT. [WOMAN] THERE'S NO CREAM AND SUGAR. [CHRISTINE] THIS IS DISGUSTING. WILL YOU HAVE IT BLACK? [MARK] HOW LONG WILL WE BE HERE? WHEN WILL WE GET OUT OF THIS HELLHOLE, PAUL? THAT'S FINE. THAT'S FINE. YEAH. [CHRISTINE] DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS FOOD IS SAFE TO EAT? FOOD POISONING IS THE LEAST OF OUR WORRIES. PAUL. [MARK] THERE'S ENOUGH GUNS IN HERE FOR A SMALL ARMY. OBVIOUSLY, THEY WERE EXPECTING TROUBLE. [ALEX] PASS THAT SAUCE. KETCHUP. BRIGHT BOY. OBVIOUSLY, IT CAME FROM THE WRONG DIRECTION. [WHIRRING] WHAT? [DISTANT EXPLOSION] [APPROACHING EXPLOSIONS] WEIRD. [BREATHING HEAVILY] EVERYBODY O.K.? I THINK IT'S TIME WE MADE A MOVE. COME ON, MARK. GET UP. MMM... MMM. SHOULD WE BE SCARED? I THINK SO. ALEX...WHAT'S THE SITUATION HERE? WHAT SITUATION ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? THE DRUG BUST SITUATION OR THIS VERY, VERY WEIRD SITUATION? BOTH. I WISH YOU HADN'T GOT US INVOLVED IN THIS STUFF. THIS STUFF... IS GOING TO BRING US A LOT OF MONEY. MONTHS OF OUR WORK, WASTED. NOT YET. PAUL STILL HAS THE HEROIN, WHICH CAN LEAD US TO THE MAIN BUYERS. DO YOU LOVE ME? WHAT ABOUT THIS PLACE? I'M INCLINED TO GO ALONG WITH LINDA'S THEORIES. IT'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF... ILLEGAL GENETIC RESEARCH. OR MAYBE THEY WERE MANUFACTURING SOME KIND OF DESIGNER DRUG. NO, NO, NO, NO. IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT. LOOK AT MARK. HE'S DYING IN FRONT OF OUR EYES. IS THAT ENOUGH PROOF FOR YOU? I HAVE TO GIVE SOME TO MARK. RIGHT. MM-HMM. SO WHAT'S THE PLAN? FIRST THING TOMORROW, WE GET OFF THIS RIG IN A LIFEBOAT. ON BOARD WILL BE AN EMERGENCY TRANSMITTER. WE SHOULD BE PICKED UP BEFORE WE KNOW IT. I CAN'T STAND THE THOUGHT OF BEING BACK IN THE WATER WITH THOSE PEOPLE. IT'S BETTER THAN STAYING HERE. PRETTY SOON, THE COMPANY THAT OWNS THIS RIG WILL SEND SOMEONE TO FIND OUT WHY THEY'VE LOST CONTACT. SO WE'LL BE PICKED UP. I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH, RACHEL. THE OWNERS MIGHT NOT APPRECIATE FINDING US HERE. YEAH, BUT WE COULD FIND OUT WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING HERE. RACHEL, WAKE UP. WE ARE SOMEWHERE WE SHOULDN'T BE. I'LL SEE YOU IN A BIT. [WHOOSH] [GROWLING] AAH! SHIT! AAH! [LINDA] PAUL! PAUL! [ALEX] WHAT'S GOING ON? PAUL! PAUL! JESUS! WHAT WAS THAT? I'VE GOT TO FIND HIM! COME ON, NOW! LET'S MOVE! COME ON! LET'S GO! NO WAY. ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? PAUL! PAUL! PAUL! PAUL! PAUL? PAUL? [CLICK] [GASP] Quiet. I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO. [WHOOSH] WELL, WE DO NOW... TOGETHER. WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS? HOW DO I KNOW? EVERYBODY JUST KEEP QUIET. PAUL! WHERE ARE YOU? [PAUL] LINDA! PAUL! PAUL! LINDA, STAND CLEAR. BUT YOU'LL HIT HIM! JUST GET OUT THE WAY. [LIQUID OOZING] WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? THEY CALL ME DR. SHELLEY... AND YOU MUST LEAVE RIG IMMEDIATELY. YOU'VE GOT PAUL IN THERE. PAUL! YOU'RE MISTAKEN, YOUNG LADY. IS NO ONE ELSE INSIDE. BELIEVE ME. [ALEX] I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE NOW. THAT WAS CHARLIE, BUT DON'T WORRY. WE HAVE HIM UNDER CONTROL AGAIN, THANKS TO YOUR FRIEND. NOW, YOU MUST GET OFF RIG NOW. YOU ARE IN GREAT DANGER. HOLD ON A SECOND HERE. LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU TURN UP RIGHT OUT OF THE BLUE, SOME THING'S GRABBED ONE OF US, AND YOU'RE TELLING US IT MAY BE A GOOD IDEA IF WE JUST LEAVE? WELL, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. PAUL! PLEASE! PLEASE...LEAVE...NOW. [DOOR CLOSES] ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, HONEY? THAT IS ONE STRONG OLD BOY. [MARK] I THINK WE SHOULD DO AS HE SAYS. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. YEAH. CAN WE LEAVE NOW, PLEASE? WHEN I FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON. [ALEX] WHERE IS HE? WHAT'S THAT SMELL? LOOK! HE'S STILL ALIVE. I KNEW IT. [LINDA] WE'VE GOT TO FIND HIM. NO! LET'S GO RIGHT AWAY! I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL I FIND HIM! GOOD LUCK. SEND US A POSTCARD. COME ON. WE'RE LEAVING. NO, MARK. WE KEEP LOOKING. HOW LONG, GODDAMN IT? UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. HE'S NOT HERE. COME ON. COME ON. WE'RE GOING TO FIND HIM. THIS IS USELESS. WE'RE BACK ON LEVEL "A." WE HAVEN'T HEARD A SINGLE THING. LET'S GO BACK. NO! WE HAVEN'T TRIED DOWN THIS WAY BEFORE. I'M SURE WE HAVEN'T. UM...I'M SORRY ABOUT PAUL. I'M SORRY, TOO. BUT, UH, THE MONEY BELT-- WHERE IS IT? [RUMBLING] AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! NOW WHAT? SOMETHING WENT BEHIND THE WALL. ARE YOU SURE? YES! THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE. SHE WAS RIGHT. MOVE! HEY! WAIT! HEY, WAIT! WAIT! I SAID WAIT! WHO ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT? [PANTING] DO YOU KNOW WHERE PAUL IS? WAIT. JUST HOLD ON A MINUTE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING. NOW, WHAT IS THIS PLACE? IT'S A RESEARCH ESTABLISHMENT. WE KNOW THAT. WHAT'S IT FOR? YOU'RE CAROL SOAMES. WE FOUND YOUR CLOTHES. I WAS CAROL SOAMES. OH, HERE WE GO. WAS? NOW, ENOUGH OF THE SILLY BREATHING. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. AAH! BRINKSTONE. WE COULDN'T RESIST THE OFFER-- UNLIMITED RESOURCES AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IN GENETIC RESEARCH. [ALEX] SO WHAT WERE THEY PAYING YOU TO DO? BRINKSTONE IS OLD. HE DOESN'T WANT TO... TO DIE. OF COURSE HE DOESN'T. WHO DOES? AAH! I MUST GO NOW! AAH! YOU AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE. JUST SIT DOWN AND ANSWER THE QUESTIONS. [DISTORTED VOICE] WE'RE ALL DEAD. [ROARING] ALEX, ARE YOU O.K.? YEAH, I'M O.K., BUT THAT'S THE SECOND TIME TODAY I'VE BEEN THROWN AROUND THE ROOM BY A COMPLETE STRANGER, AND MY CONFIDENCE NOW IS VERY, VERY LOW. THIS IS EMBARRASSING. I'M 6' 3". SOMEONE ELSE IS DOING THE INTRODUCTIONS. ALEX! ALEX, WAIT! ALEX! OH, NOT AGAIN. THERE'S SOMETHING VERY WEIRD GOING ON HERE. NO! WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST CLUE? PAUL AND I FOUND HER CLOTHES EARLIER-- HER SHOES, HER BRACELET, EVERYTHING. NOW SHE'S WEARING THE SAME THINGS AGAIN. A 5-FOOT DOCTOR JUST THREW MR. MACHO THROUGH A GLASS WALL. YOU'RE TALKING TO ME ABOUT HER JEWELRY? WHAT'S SO WEIRD ABOUT THAT? THIS IS. I CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER FOR THOSE TWO. I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR PAUL AGAIN. NO. DON'T LEAVE US. CAN YOU PLEASE STOP HER SCREAMING? DID YOU CATCH UP WITH HER? NO. SHE MOVED TOO FAST. WHERE'S RACHEL? I DIDN'T SEE HER. [MARK] SHE FOLLOWED YOU OUT. WHERE? ALEX! ALEX! ALEX! [RUMBLING] AAH! OH, GOD! OH, THANK GOD IT'S YOU! JUST CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN! SHE'S CHASING ME-- THE SOAMES WOMAN-- EXCEPT IT'S NOT HER. IT'S O.K. JUST GET BACK. [BANGING] I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? BUCKLEY. SECURITY. BUT I WOULDN'T STAND AROUND HERE SOCIALIZING. CHARLIE'S COMING. FOLLOW ME. THIS WAS THE SCIENTISTS' REC ROOM. CONCENTRATE YOUR FIRE, AND WE CAN SLOW IT DOWN. BUT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DRIVE IT AWAY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? ALEX, I GOT TO TELL YOU WHAT I SAW. [BUCKLEY] ALL RIGHT. AIN'T GOT MUCH TIME. MAKE SURE YOU GOT A CLEAN LINE OF FIRE TO THE DOOR. THE SCIENTISTS... THEY FUCKED UP. THEY THINK THEY CAN GET IT UNDER CONTROL AGAIN. BUT THEY'RE GETTING WEAKER... AND IT'S GETTING STRONGER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHERE ARE THE OTHERS? WITH CHARLIE! GET READY NOW. [COCKS GUN] IT'S REAL CLOSE. I CAN'T HEAR A THING. BELIEVE ME... IT'S CLOSE. REALLY CLOSE. SO WHERE IS IT? JESUS! [CHRISTINE CRYING] [MARK] WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE! WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE! CALM DOWN! YOU PANIC, AND WE'RE DEAD! DID YOU SEE THAT THING? IT WAS, LIKE, BIG AND SLIMY, AND IT WAS... SHE'S ALIVE, BUT SHE'S CUT REALLY BAD. WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT SECURITY GUARD? ARE YOU BLIND? HE WAS CHARLIE. [MARK] I DON'T GET IT! JOIN THE CLUB. GET OVER HERE AND HELP RACHEL. NOW WOULD YOU PLEASE... GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE! [MARK] WEIRD. WEIRD. WEIRD SHIT. WEIRD. [ALEX] COME ON! WAIT! WEIRD SHIT. WEIRD SHIT. WEIRD SHIT. WAIT UP! WEIRD SHIT. WEIRD SHIT. WEIRD SHIT. [THUNDER] [BEEPING] WEIRD. WEIRD SHIT. WEIRD, WEIRD, WEIRD, WEIRD. OH...WEIRD. WELL, I'VE DONE ALL I CAN. SHE LOOKS BAD. HOLD IT! WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT ROOM? I DON'T KNOW, MARK. LINDA, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF RESEARCH COULD PRODUCE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHAT DID DR. SOAMES SAY ABOUT BRINKSTONE'S FEAR OF DEATH? LINDA, THAT THING IN THE REC ROOM HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH BRINKSTONE'S FEAR OF DYING. YEAH. IT'S KIND OF EXTREME. [MARK] I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS. WHERE DID IT COME FROM? [CHRISTINE] WE'RE GOING TO DIE IF WE STAY HERE. [ALEX] SO YOU TWO WANT TO LEAVE? ARE YOU CRAZY? WITH THAT THING OUT THERE? THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S OUT THERE. AND THIS ROOM HAS ONLY ONE WAY IN. AT LEAST HERE, WE KNOW WHEN IT'S COMING. [GAGGING] BEFORE WE ALL START PANICKING AND RUNNING AROUND SCREAMING, LET'S TRY AND MAKE SENSE OF ALL THIS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MAKE SENSE-- JUST LISTEN TO WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY! NOW, WE'VE GOT THIS THING THAT'S RUNNING AROUND THAT SOMETIMES LOOKS LIKE A SECURITY GUARD, RIGHT? AND LET'S PRESUME IT'S ON THE RIG. BUT AT LEAST TWO SCIENTISTS ARE STILL ALIVE WHO HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER IT. YEAH, BUT THE SCIENTISTS ARE SERIOUSLY WEIRD PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY THE SOAMES WOMAN. WHAT IS THAT STINK IN HERE? IT'S DISGUSTING! I'VE SMELLED IT BEFORE... IN THE LAB AND IN THE REC ROOM. [MOANING] AND DO YOU THINK IT'S BACK? WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIGHT IT OFF BECAUSE WE WERE O.K. BEFORE, RIGHT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THAT THING WAS GOING TO KILL ALL OF US WHEN IT DECIDED TO LEAVE. [RACHEL] OH! OH! RACHEL? HI. HOW DO YOU FEEL? ARE YOU IN ANY PAIN? CAN I GET YOU SOME DEMEROL? YES. I AM KIND OF SORE. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK. IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK. SHE'S SLEEPING NOW. BARRING COMPLICATIONS, SHE SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT. WILL SHE BE FIT TO TRAVEL? BECAUSE WE NEED TO MOVE. IN A LIFEBOAT, IF I CAN OPERATE THE LAUNCHING GEAR. A ROUGH BOAT RIDE MIGHT BUST HER STITCHES, AND I WON'T BE THERE TO SEW HER BACK UP. I'M STAYING HERE UNTIL I FIND PAUL. LINDA, THE CHANCES OF PAUL EVEN BEING REMOTELY... NO! HE'S STILL ALIVE. WHAT IS THIS, A GAME? I CAN'T BELIEVE AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH, YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GO OFF BY YOURSELF. I DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE, DO I? LOOK, I WOULD COME WITH YOU, BUT I CAN'T LEAVE RACHEL ALONE. LINDA, WAIT. I'LL GO. STAY HERE AND LOOK AFTER RACHEL. WHAT'S WITH THE SUDDEN SHOW OF CONCERN? LOOK, JUST MAKE UP YOUR MIND. IF ANYTHING COMES THROUGH THAT DOOR APART FROM ME, SHOOT HIM. [COCKS GUN] Thanks. [THUNDER] YOU KNOW, I WAS CONVINCED ALEX WAS AN ASSHOLE. No. HE'S JUST A DICK, THAT'S ALL. NO. IT'S AS... WHERE DID YOU GET THAT? I FOUND IT IN THE CORRIDOR SO PAUL MUST HAVE DROPPED IT WHEN HE, UM... YEAH, WHEN HE WAS TAKING IT TO YOU. GOOD OLD PAUL. I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR GETTING PAUL INVOLVED WITH THIS. DON'T BE SUCH A PAIN IN THE ASS. MAYDAY. MAYDAY. THIS IS BRINKSTONE PLATFORM 134. REPEAT, 134. [BEEPING] FUCK ME. ALICE IN WONDERLAND. I...I HOPE... YOU PEOPLE... HAVE FOUND THIS TAPE. THIS MAY BE MY LAST CHANCE...TO WARN YOU. I HAVEN'T THE STRENGTH... TO FIGHT CHARLIE... ANYMORE. I SHALL BECOME ONE WITH HIM... SOON... LIKE THE OTHERS. WE--WE NEVER REALLY BELIEVED WE WOULD ACHIEVE WHAT BRINKSTONE WANTED, SO WE ALL GOT ONE HELL OF SURPRISE WHEN WE MAKE BREAKTHROUGH SO QUICKLY. YOU SEE, 95% OF ALL LIVING TISSUE IS MADE UP OF WATER. THE TRICK WAS TO CONCENTRATE ON THE 5%. INCREDIBLY, WE SUCCEEDED IN CREATING A PACKAGE OF SYNTHETIC DNA CAPABLE OF INSTANT EVOLUTION. YOU SHOULDN'T BE OUT OF BED SO SOON. I'M A FAST HEALER. TAKE A LOOK. I DON'T GET IT. IT'S SIMPLE. I WANT YOU... RIGHT NOW. YOU DO? COR. MARK! WHAT? HELP ME. HELP YOU WHAT? I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS. IT'S MAKING ME! YOU GOT TO GET ALEX. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, GET ALEX? RACHEL, YOU'RE ACTING WEIRD. WE--WE CALLED IT PROTEUS. BUT AFTER A SERIES OF FAILURES TO GET ANY OF OUR TEST ANIMALS TO ACCEPT PROTEUS... WE TESTED IT ON OUR SPECIMEN OF CARCHARODON-- A SHARK WHICH WE NICKNAMED CHARLIE, and it worked. DEAR GOD, IT WORKED. Y-Y-YOU'RE... YOU'RE ACTING WEIRD. AAH! AAH! AAH! LET GO! AAH! LET GO! LET GO! WHEN WE FINALLY MANAGED TO KILL THE SHARK. WE THOUGHT IT HAD RUN OUT OF...PROTECTIVE ADAPTATIONS. WE WERE WRONG. PROTEUS HAD MOVED ON TO NEW LEVEL. IT HAD CONVERTED SHARK'S TISSUE INTO A NEW FORM-- AMORPHOUS. THAT NIGHT, IT CRAWLED OUT OF TANK AND CONSUMED... EVERY OTHER SPECIMEN IN THE AQUARIUM. WE WERE OVERJOYED. WE WERE IDIOTS. ARE YOU SHOOTING UP AGAIN? YOU'LL KILL YOURSELF. WE THOUGHT WE COULD CONTAIN THE SITUATION EVEN WHEN IT STARTED ATTACKING US. WE KEPT TRYING TO KILL IT, BUT OUR OWN SUCCESS AT CREATING SOMETHING UNKILLABLE FINISHED US. IN THE END, IT GOT US ALL. [LINDA] MARK, WHERE'S RACHEL? HMM? I KNOW YOU'RE ZAPPED OUT, BUT YOU MUST HAVE SEEN HER LEAVE. I DIDN'T SEE HER. Oh, my God. YOUR STUPID JERK OF A BOYFRIEND LET RACHEL WANDER OFF. THE CREATURE IS CHANGING... MUTATING... BECOMING MORE POWERFUL. BUT BASICALLY, IT REMAINS A KILLER. [CHRISTINE] YOU CAN'T LEAVE US. WATCH ME. WAIT! DON'T LEAVE US. I'M GOING TO FIND RACHEL. AND MAKE SURE THE IDIOT DOESN'T OVERDOSE. PROTEUS DNA HAS SUCCEEDED IN CREATING ULTIMATE SURVIVAL MECHANISM. CHARLIE HIJACKS DNA OF HIS VICTIMS ALONG WITH ANY OTHER POTENTIALLY VALUABLE SURVIVAL CHARACTERISTICS. IN OUR CASE, OUR KNOWLEDGE... OUR MEMORIES. [RACHEL] HI, CHRIS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ALL BEEN ABSORBED WITHIN THE THING, SOME OF US HAVE REMAINED INTACT... AS INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITIES. BUT THE CREATURE IS GROWING MORE POWERFUL, MORE INTELLIGENT ALL OF THE TIME. I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHERE'S MARK? HE'S CLOSE-- VERY CLOSE. HEROIN HAS A STRANGE EFFECT ON THE CREATURE-- CONFUSES IT, WHICH IS WHY I HAVE AGAIN RESUMED... TEMPORARY CONTROL. HE'S WAITING FOR YOU. SO IS CHARLIE. MY... MY GUESS... IS A VERY LARGE DOSE... OF HEROIN WILL KNOCK CHARLIE OUT... LONG ENOUGH... FOR YOU... TO KILL IT. RACHEL... RACHEL, YOU'RE SCARING ME. NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF. YOU'LL LIKE CHARLIE. AH! AH! GOD. AH! AH! RUN, CHRISSIE! RUN! AAH! AAH! OH, THANK GOD. OH, NO! GOD, PLEASE, NO! AAH! [THUNDER] ALEX, OH, THANK GOD. RACHEL, WHERE ARE THE OTHERS? I DON'T KNOW. WHEN I WOKE UP, I WAS ALL BY MYSELF. I WAS SO SCARED. SHH. I CAN'T BELIEVE LINDA LEFT YOU LIKE THIS. ALEX, PLEASE, CAN WE JUST... CAN WE JUST PLEASE LEAVE HERE RIGHT NOW? TO HELL WITH THE BUST. I JUST WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE. WE CAN, BUT, UM, HOW DO YOU FEEL? NOT SO HOT. I HAD SUCH A TERRIBLE NIGHTMARE. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. I JUST KEEP HEARING THESE VOICES IN MY HEAD. SHH. YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT. YOU'RE PROBABLY STILL IN SHOCK. HOW ARE THE GASHES ON YOUR CHEST? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THAT THING CLAWED YOU RIGHT ACROSS YOUR CHEST. NO. THAT WAS MY NIGHTMARE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I DON'T HAVE ANY GASHES. THAT WAS MY DREAM. WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT? OH, RACHEL... WHAT? RACHEL... DON'T COME ANY CLOSER. ARE YOU CRAZY? RACHEL, HE'S GOT YOU. HE'S GOT YOU. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? PLEASE, ALEX, IT'S ME. I WISH IT WAS. RACHEL, I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY. NO! [DISTORTED VOICE] YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. YOU'VE WOKEN THEM UP. [CREATURE ROARING] AAH! JESUS CHRIST, LINDA! JESUS CHRIST, DON'T SHOOT! HOLD YOUR FIRE AND TALK TO ME. YOU DON'T FOOL ME. YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE THINGS. NO, I'M NOT, AND THERE'S ONLY ONE OF IT. YEAH--OF WHAT? LISTEN, I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT. DR. SHELLEY LEFT A CASSETTE EXPLAINING EVERYTHING. THERE'S ONLY ONE CREATURE, AND I JUST MET IT IN THE INFIRMARY. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD SAY. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU STOPPED BEING THE OLD ALEX. THE OLD ALEX WAS AN ACT. LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS CLICHED, AND I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE THAT I'M SAYING THIS, BUT I'M A POLICE OFFICER. OH, COME ON. IT'S TRUE. RACHEL WAS A FEDERAL AGENT. WERE TARGETED BY THE D.E.A. MONTHS AGO. YOU ASSHOLE. LINDA, I'M A POLICE OFFICER, AND YOU'RE A DRUG SMUGGLER. I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE DRUG SMUGGLING. IT DIDN'T STOP YOUR LATE BOYFRIEND PAUL FROM DEALING IN HEROIN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, LATE BOYFRIEND? LINDA, PAUL'S PART OF THAT THING NOW. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. WELL, HE MUST BE, LIKE THE OTHERS. BECAUSE I JUST MET IT IN THE INFIRMARY. NO. ALEX, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. SUIT YOURSELF. NOW, DO YOU WANT TO STAY OR CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF? THAT'S HOW IT GETS AROUND-- THROUGH THE VENTILATION SYSTEM. BUT HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY FIT IN SUCH A SMALL PLACE? WELL, ACCORDING TO DR. SHELLEY-- I'VE SEEN THAT SLIMY STUFF BEFORE-- AN AQUARIUM ON THE LOWEST LEVEL. THERE'S A BIG TANK. THE SIDES ARE COVERED WITH IT. SHOW ME. CARCHARODON-- THE GREAT WHITE. CHARLIE.

I GUESS IT MUST STILL BE IN OUR CABIN. NO. I CHECKED. YOU MUST HAVE PUT IT SOMEWHERE. I DIDN'T PUT IT ANYWHERE. LINDA, I NEED THAT HEROIN. NOW, MARK AND CHRISTINE WERE THE ONLY OTHER ONES WHO KNEW WHERE IT WAS, AND THEY DIDN'T TAKE IT, SO THAT JUST LEAVES YOU. I DIDN'T TAKE YOUR DAMN MONEY BELT. HOW DO YOU KNOW MARK OR CHRISTINE DIDN'T? I JUST KNOW. DO YOU LOVE ME? PAUL. NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO JOIN THE OTHERS. THEN YOU'LL HAVE NO SECRETS FROM ME. PAUL! NO! [ALEX] LET HER GO, CHARLIE. I'VE GOT WHAT YOU WANT. WHERE IS IT, AL?

YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS, BUT THAT IS NOT DR. SHELLEY. IT'S ONLY SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE HIM. NOW, YOUR PROJECT WENT WRONG, AND THAT IS THE RESULT-- THE MONSTER FROM HELL. HE HAS KILLED EVERYBODY ELSE ON THIS RIG, AND WE'RE ALL NEXT. I TOLD YOU-- HE'S DRUG SMUGGLER. HE OBVIOUSLY SAMPLES HIS OWN PRODUCT. O.K., LET'S TRY THIS ONE. I'M AN UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICER. RIGHT? AND EVERYBODY HERE IS UNDER ARREST. [SHELLEY] HE IS COMICAL. HA HA HA! THE MAN'S MAD. HA HA HA! DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING, BRINKSTONE? YOU COULD BE RIGHT. YOU WANT TO LIVE FOREVER?
