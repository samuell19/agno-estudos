"I am new here." "I don't know." "I started today." I don't want to hear such answers. You have to say "I will inform you soon, sir." If you say "no" or "I don't know", then you are not part of the hotel staff. Service staff must understand what services the hotel provides. Never gesticulate when you answer customers' complaints. Sometimes customers shout. You apologize and leave without arguing. Let's go through the list together, question by question, okay? Hakan Hoşcan, right? - Yes. Are your mother and father still alive? - Yes. Your mother is alive. Your father is alive. - Alive. Do you have brothers, Hakan? - Yes. How many? - Eleven without me. Eleven. So twelve with you included. Nice. Why lifeguard? I grew up... near the river in my village. - I understand. So you've never worked before? I used to study. - You graduated? I was admitted but never attended the lectures. Why? I spent many years at home, instead of going to university. I was reading books and watching movies. I hardly left the house. This led to social anxiety disorder. The hotel is a convenient place to overcome social anxiety. I also need to learn English to move to the US. Why would you like to go to the US? I want to make a movie there. Movie? Nice. Follow your dreams. You took a first step by coming all the way from your village. To learn and to discover the world. The next step from here is very important. Sign here and fill in the form. For 'work area' you write down 'safety' and 'lifeguard'. Do you have a girlfriend? - No. I think you'll find one here. You understand our rules. Smile. Treat our customers well. You have to greet everyone. "Hello." "Hello." "Have a nice holiday." "Welcome." Go to the dorm. Tomorrow morning you'll start working. You're a lifeguard, right? You were here last year also? No. I started this year. It's my first job ever. Most of the lifeguards look familiar to me. Three of them worked here last year. Look Fatih. Look one by one. Wow... Books of philosophers. We read the same kind of books. Nietzsche is like a medicine for me. Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. Do you know Schopenhauer? Bearne. Is there someone called Bearne? - Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer? - Do you know him? Yes, but I never read his books. - He is the mentor of Nietzsche. He is also German. - A German philosopher? Germans are good. Karl Marx, Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud... Freud. I can't pronounce his name, but I know his books. Sigmund Freud. - Exactly. You pronounce it right. Have you ever read Karacaoglan? Karacaoglan has beautiful erotic poems. Neyzen Tevfik too. I once loved Neyzen Tevfik and Omar Khayyám. And poet Eşref. Neyzen Tevfik has provocative poems. - He's fantastic. He used to be my idol. I had a poster of him. Once Neyzen was drunk in Kadiköy. He suddenly shouted: "Hey, bastards." Everyone looked behind them... To which he said: "How many are you?" Ismail or Ali? - Ismail. Welcome, Ismail. - Thank you. Are you born in 2000? - Yes. You're from Sanliurfa? You are 18 years old. You came a long way to work. Why do you want to work? To support my family. Is that the only reason? - Yes. Does your family need support? - Yes. Is it their decision or yours? - My decision. You want to help your family? - Yes. Congratulations. Or is it to be able to get married? - No. No marriage plans yet? There are not enough job opportunities in your hometown? Why are you here? So far away from your home village. Why? There must be a reason? - Must be. I used to be a hairdresser. - What? Hairdresser. - Ah, hairdresser. There were no more jobs after the arrival of the Syrians. So that's why you came here. You're going to work in the kitchen. You travelled a long way and I know you are tired. Go to the lodging house and rest. Take a picture of yourself. Hang it next to the mirror. Look at it again when you leave to see how you changed. Okay? - Okay, chef. Okay, you can leave now. Ismail, wash this. Do you like the hotel? - Yes. It's beautiful. You will get used to it. - He will. Nobody will bother you. Just tell them I'm your brother. Relax. Focus on your job. Learn to make soup. Soup. Look. No lentil soup, ezogelin soup or tarhana soup. That's the Eastern culture. Do you understand? They have 3 kinds of soup. Soup with flour and chicken, Italian and Russian soup. Learn to prepare them. Get to know the ingredients. Like this, you can become an assistant in the kitchen. Automatically a higher position. Do you understand? And don't get too familiar with guests. - Always smile. Guests are on holiday to empty their heads, to relax. Why would they come if you have a long face? Enough sour people where they come from. Right? These are the rules of the hotel business. Be careful with the slide. Make sure there is enough time in between. Let them line up on the stairs. Don't send them too fast. Avoid collisions. Wait. Ask. Talk. Call me if they don't understand you. If you can't solve the problem, send the tourist to me. Don't argue. Stay polite. Let them swear at you. Don't react. If you have a problem, tell Şahin. He can come to me, and if needed, I will pass it to the director. These pants are too short and too tight. And this one is also too tight. Does that bother you? Yes, it bothers. They are really too tight. Go now. It's not an option to tighten these pants? What? You're done. Take your clothes and leave. Sercan, have Ismail grill the meat. Tak, tak, tak... Press it with your hand like this. Press it. With your fingers. I want him to work in the staff restaurant to develop a career in the warm kitchen. He currently has no work experience, Ibrahim. He is a good, friendly boy. He is eager to learn. He was a hairdresser. Right? - Yes. He has to learn so he can move forward. - Indeed. Now he has to develop himself. Do you know why most of them come to this place? "Wow, tourism! Girls... Parties, sun, beach. There is none of that in my village." Some employees just want to make money and party. Others want to get somewhere. The most important thing during the learning process, is keeping your back straight. Keep that in mind, Ismail is young. He is still wet behind the ears. - Indeed. "Hard." Difficult. "Hardly". Barely. "Hardly." - Yes. "Happily." What "ply"? Yes. What does he say? "Happily." Happy. In a happy way. "Happy." - "Happy." Happy. "Happily." - "Happy" means happy. "Forwards, backwards." I didn't understand anything, Şahin. Read. "Hey is waiting for..." - Where does it say "hey"? What is this? - "He." I say "hey" to "he", but they understand. Communication is 30% talking and 70% body language. I am reading a book at the moment. They are there again, the 2 pm shift. The vultures are waiting. Wait. I was first in line. Relax, relax. Do you speak English? - No. Mister, where are you from? Russia. - Russia. Do you speak English? - No. Do you speak English? - Kiril. My name is Kiril. - Three you? Kiril. Uğurcan, check if he is still in the slide. See if he clings again like yesterday. Problem? Is he there? Okay. Mister, where are you from? Russia. - Russia. Do you know Dostoyevsky? Pushkin? "Dostoyevsky njet?" - Yes. Okay. Let me check your bags. If you greet a foreign tourist once, you will get along until the end of his holiday. They are good dads who pay attention to their children. They obey their wives. If we talk to a Turkish woman, her husband looks at us with disgust. There is of course the issue of religion. What's wrong with it? - They are Christian. Of course it is their business... but Islam is the most beautiful religion. That's true. - How did you come to this conclusion? Since I was born. If we think logically, it is impossible to understand the concept of God. Think about it. If you don't boil the tea, does it cook itself? I'm just giving an example. Or look at the fruit, for example the orange. Safely inside its peel, you see all the pre-cut parts. As if someone prepared it. This is my opinion. - It makes no sense to me. The fact that the world is such a bad place, despite the interference of God, is blasphemy. Do you believe in the existence of God? Actually I have no idea. But I hope there is a God. It was 2011, the year after my high school graduation. In my hometown Kadirli... a boy stops a school bus. His sweetheart is in the bus. The boy is a Kurd, just like you. Where I come from, people are nationalistic and girls are not allowed to marry Kurds. He stops the schoolbus and shoots. If I'm not mistaken, there are 3 or 4 people killed. That people with so much lust for life have been killed, shocked me. That God did not intervene bothered me enormously. I see "unscrupulousness" in that. I mean the unscrupulousness of God. Then I started questioning God. Since then I am confused. You'll find the truth... - Huh? Seek the truth and you shall find. From now on I want to see these mats super clean. This is not allowed in the dishwasher. Or I deduct their costs from your wages. Same with broken pans and pots. You are too late again. Fast. Fast. Go. Go. Is the fish ready? Is the mücver ready? Is the bread already sliced? Hurry. The soup here. I am hungry for soup. How are you? - I am fine, chef. How is it going? - Good. I am busy. You have the entire kitchen on your own. That's not the case. - He is promoted. Cola or Fanta? What does the chef recommend? The chef recommends Fanta. Do you have a plaster? Plaster? - Yes, plaster. Not here. "Aqua". You wait? - Okay. Where is the woman? Was it the one standing? - Yes. We need to see doctor, right? What is your name? Hakan. Harakan? - Hakan. Garakan? - Hakan. Harry Kane? I know Harry Kane. Where is Nadja? She has followed a medical education. Nadja, we have a toenail here that came of. You probably know better how to apply a bandage. Be brave. We need vodka. Ouch! Why does this hurt so much? It will pass quickly. She asked my name. I said: "Hakan." She said: "Harakan." And she called me: "Harry Kane." What? - Harry Kane. Do you know Harry Kane? How would you know? They go crazy, Ismail. Take a look at my brother. We are like in prison. When I was living in my village, I always wanted to know about the world outside. I asked my friends all about it, when they returned to the village. And now I know. I also knew nothing when I arrived. I was looking all around. But now I am used to it. You slowly adapt and then you also want to go on a holiday. But it needs to be an all-inclusive hotel. Full option. Full plus full. - You pay and enjoy. That's what I call a hotel. Ottoman cuisine, à la carte menu, swimming pool, club, disco... snackbar, döner... Everything has to be inclusive. Everyone has the right to have some vacation. We do too. This is true. Everyone goes on vacation. They go everywhere. They jump into the sea and the swimming pool in front of our noses. We cannot do what they do, but I want that too. I would love to live there. Abroad? - Yes, I really would like. I also want to go. - Ibo, nephew! I'm going abroad. I am starting the procedure. Now you know. I am also going abroad. It's so nice there. Not a single foreigner complained until now. But Turks complain often. Turks always complain. - As if they own us. Foreigners are better. They are warm and polite. And they love making fun. As long as there is entertainment, they are always happy. If the guests are so happy here, who knows how happy they are in their country. I want to go after my military service. They don't share the boats with my kids. They pass the boats around, but not to us. That it may be easy. - Thank you. Aren't there any spoons? Up. Enough? Don't give too much food, okay? - Okay. That it may be easy. - Thank you. Soup? The chef told me to give enough, as someone complained. Why? - Because we don't give enough food. Can I have some more? Sit down, cousin. No, no, no. - Why? Forbidden. I had an argument... - Man... I told to pass the float, but he refused. - I am about to call names. I let a tourist sit down. He was very impatient and rude. You wanted me to schedule you on the platform, but now you will prefer the floor. Let us go. Wait. Wait. Please. It's water. Can I take a look at your bag? Look, there is an orange tree over there. - Indeed. They don't grow at your place. Our climate is identical to here. Everything that grows here also grows with us. My brother wants me to grow in the kitchen. He wants me to be a cook. That is a good profession, but I prefer working as a hairdresser abroad. I love foreign countries. I'd love to go after my service. The people are nice. You like foreign countries or you don't like Turkey? I love Turkey, but it's nicer there. People are beautiful and considerate. That's why I love foreign countries. I see inside the hotel how these people are. In the hotel? More considerate? - Indeed. You should be more in touch with people. Then you will see. In the beginning you have specific ideas. For example, learning your job. After a while, you will master your job and you begin to notice other things. Only then you notice injustice. If someone is rude to you, it hurts. Put yourself in my position. I'm 25. If someone is arrogant to me, then I can't bear it. Being in constant contact with such people, is a problem. Shall we commit suicide, Ismail? - Come. Ever committed suicide? - From this height it will not work. Worst case some bone fractures. - No way. Shall we try? - You will die from this height. Fifth floor... You will not die. - You will die. 70 to 80% chance of dying. My suicide knowledge is very good. This is all you had to do. The sea is your responsibility. You are responsible for the security over there. The pier is closed. How can I get there? How can I go, Musa? Swim? - Aren't you the lifeguard? Do you really expect me to swim all the way? - That's up to you. I can't cross the pier. - I also can't cross the pier. Then there is nothing we can do. We closed the pier. We cordoned it off and secured it. We've done our job. - You're not a real guard, Musa. And you're not a real lifeguard. Why am I not a lifeguard? - Why am I not a security guard? Hello. - What are you doing? Just sitting. - Where? At home. How's my mother? - My mother saw her walking with a pile of old fabrics. You never call. Is it because I still owe you money? - No. How's the dollar? I don't care, I don't have any dollars. Süleyman, you don't care, but I do. I want to go to America. When I started working, the dollar was worth 4.5 lira and it rose to 7.5 lira. I don't know what the rate is today. I have to work twice as much to save the same amount. Is it better that it drops or rises? Of course it's better that it drops, Süleyman. I also want it to fall, because I want to buy a moped. The price is pegged to the dollar. In dollars? Your moped has now become more expensive. The same moped that costed 5,000 lira last year, is now 8,500 lira. Ismail, bring me a plate. - Here it is. Spicy. Minced meat. Shall I make you one? I make you one. - Yes. Are you from Russia? - Pardon? Russia. - Russia? Where is she from? - England. I'm English. Will she be coming back next year? I'm making pide. How do I tell her I'll make one for her tomorrow evening too? Madam, listen to what he's saying. Tomorrow evening. I'll study English this winter. Is she her daughter? - She is. Translate "Look at her mother before marrying a girl." "Beautiful mama, beautiful son." Where is her father? Father? - Your husband. He's dead? Where is he? In England. He's working and you're on holiday? I expect you at the same time tomorrow. I turn off the oven. - Okay. Be careful. Put it in the dish kitchen. - Okay. The girl was looking at you, Ismail. Why didn't you look at her? - That's not for me. Why not? We can't understand each other. So what? She could learn Turkish like many people do. People cross the desert for love. What are you talking about? You can learn her language. Men can achieve anything. You're a handsome guy. English and Russian people like dark skinned people. I'm blonde. I have a white skin. You have a dark skin. You are one step ahead. Just try going abroad. They had only eyes for you. They didn't pay me any attention. Soup? Come have some food. Give it to me. Do you want to take some Cola? Is two enough? Aren't you going to drink it? - No. Ismail, don't give anyone more than 1 drink. Give no one more than 1 Cola. - Says who? Wait a second. Why are you talking behind my back? Did you hear your name? Don't be silly, son of a bitch. I know why you said that. Why do you bother? I put them back. Stop talking about it. - Why do you bother? You told me to put them back and I did. - I only asked why you took three. Okay. Isn't there a problem here? Didn't you realize it was a joke? - No, I didn't. Why not? - I didn't understand. Why not? - I didn't understand. Don't we know each other? - No. No. Stop it. Okay. We will meet again, Mr. Hakan. - Calm down. There is no problem. I give everyone more than one Cola. I can also give you more Cola. There are plenty. Cola is not the problem. It's his attitude. He can drink his Cola. The writing is difficult. If you want to learn Russian, you can have it. I no longer have any sympathy for Russians. When I just arrived here, the Russians seemed much better to me. I only knew the Russians from books. That will also have its influence. We call this phenomenon Dostoyevsky-titis. Did I show you my picture of 5 years ago? - No. Don't laugh. Don't make me angry. What is this, Ismail? You're so little. You have no pictures from your childhood? - No. I only have this picture and one where I am 1 year old. 1 year? - Yes. But I don't have that picture with me. It's at home. I haven't seen my village a long time. You should go there for a week when you leave here. Okay. - Not "okay". Really go. It is great to see your parents once in a while. In a way, a person misses the warmth of a family. No matter what, there is love for sure. Your family loves you. They alleviate your worries a little. Right? Yes. - "Vara vara." I learned Arabic. - Are you Kurdish? "Vara vara", is that Kurdish? - Yes. "Ez te hez dikim"? It means "I love you". Is that Kurdish as well? - Yes. When are you going to the US? - I'll see. If possible next year. And you? Where to? - To America. What should I do there? But later, when I have a career in the army and I saved some money, between 10.000 and 30.000 lira. Then I'll go... By helicopter? - ...to the Florida Islands. I can't pronounce it, but I'll go there. The pronunciation is not the problem. - Sometimes my tongue is too slow. That is not the problem. But go on. Or New Zealand. There are no mosquitoes. Don't laugh. I am serious. Not Russia. It's too cold. Şahin, the lack of mosquitoes attracts you to New Zealand? No mosquitoes and a lot of forests. Well, in my village there are also a lot of forests and no mosquitoes. In your village... - Indeed, no mosquitoes. What? - There are none. Hardly any people in your village, only four houses. It's normal there are no mosquitoes. Shall I tell you about my film project? Yes. I am listening. A house with five levels. These five levels... If you consider the house as a human being, then you have five epiphanies. Five transitions to a new level. The first is the transition from childhood to adulthood. The person is someone who believes he can change the world. An innocent. At the second level the person starts to doubt he can change the world. He's slowly coming to his senses. At the third level he has given up. He's a nihilist. He sees no meaning in life. He's given up on everything. Since my start here, I went though these three stages. When I arrived, I thought I could meet like-minded people and fit in. That was my hope. Later on, that hope turned into suspicion. The suspicion didn't last long. And now I have no expectations. So you passed three levels. What about four and five? - I don't know about them. One needs to overcome nihilism. 1) Hope 2) Doubt 3) Nihilism 4) ?? Okay. Is it finished? - Yes. I burned my finger. If I ever cut pita again... Put something on it. Come on. It has been enough. Let's fence off the buffet with a red ribbon. Fence off this area so no one can enter. They keep on coming. How many minutes left? - I'm exhausted. By the time this is done, it's time. 9 minutes. - 9 minutes left. Okay. Then we cannot close yet. We will continue until it's time. A watch. Run for it. Hurry. Yes. Fight. Love energy, please wake up. Put your right hand on your forehead. Open your left hand. Very good. Your Kundalini energy awakened. How shall I cut your hair, honey? - The sides short and the top long. Don't you have a hairpin? I'll put a hairpin around your neck. - No hairpin? Isn't it better to start with hair clippers? - Impossible. Really? - Really. I'll cut your hair with a scissor. Bend your head. Why haven't I cut your hair before? - What? Why haven't I cut your hair before? Is it long? - Yes. Do you have to leave early in the morning? - Yes. Me too. Wake me up. Keep on dreaming. You'd better wake me up. I hope I wake up on time. My finger burns very hard. Your hair is not normal hair. Tomorrow they will say at the hotel that a human being has arrived. You all wear the same T-shirt. Okay, Hakan? Pay attention to your appearance, personal care and comb your hair. Your hair will be messy when you come out of the water, but just comb it. See that you have everything with you to tidy up your hair. Look, it's that simple. I don't like that. - I don't care. I want you to look good for my guests. Okay? - Okay. During your application I told you to learn English. Did you? I have hardly looked at my English study book. - Why? I have not found my way. Where else could you be among more people? Where he works right now is the busiest slide. He is constantly among the Arabs, Russians, British and must communicate with them. You must say "hello" to everyone. I'm going to print a paper for you with the rules in English. Okay? Hakan? - Okay. Do you have a toothache? You are so absent. Didn't sleep last night? - I'm tired. I've been tired for a long time. Only boat. Only boat. - There are no boats. And this is supposed to be an aquapark. You understand? We want to stick to the rules, but there are no boats. Did you warn them? - No, I didn't say anything. You just let them go? - They sat down and left. Give me a valid reason so that I can make the report to your advantage. That at least I can defend you. The man admitted that his wife fell and tumbled. What shall we do? I don't want you to get fired. Give me a good reason. I want to make clear what happened. - I don't care. This morning I told a man it's forbidden to go by two. He replied there are not enough boats. What now? How did the accident happen? I just let them go by two. - Without warning? Okay. Read and sign. If there is a mistake, I will correct it. They threw stones in the pool. - That's not our problem. What? Are stones not your problem? Have they already called you? - I called. The woman is still in hospital. Still? - Dismissal is out of the question. I'm going to put pressure not to fire you. If I am not fired, I want to resign myself. - They won't fire you. Who says that? Don't think about resigning. Think about me down there. Everyone comes to argue. Over a boat, over extra staff, or I'm not human, or I am not a man. I cannot handle it any longer. I'm stuck in my little world there. I'm trapped there. - I'll let you work downstairs for a day. What does our job hold? When we discuss with the guests, we do our job well. Recently I had a fist fight with a guest. Did they fire me? I just did my job well. Already two months I am asking to take a leave. I can't take a leave either. And certainly not if you quit. I couldn't take a leave for 4 months. Think about me... Şahin, I might be making coffee, but I really have no lust for life. Do you know that story, Şahin? - No. We saw a... - It was written on an old Transit. No, it was written on a camionette. - Indeed. It was written: "I might be moving, but I have no lust for life." I am in no mood. I'm bankrupt. - I know the feeling. No internet, my mobile phone is blocked, no money for cigarettes. It makes you feel powerless. - Yes, I feel worthless. Not worthless, but powerless. How much of your wage have you lost while gambling? Two wages and I borrowed another 1.000 lira. What's so funny about it, Şahin? You have lost 2.000 lira. Are you crazy? How much money do you have left? - Zero. And you're thinking about resigning. I might be lying here, but I have no lust for life. Ismail, I want to eat in the staff restaurant. How much are you going to eat? The meat has been burned. Nobody works as hard as Ismail. - No one. Bring the cutlery inside. - With 6 hotels, you could work in 2. What do we eat at the staff party? I am going to eat you. Where are you going? - There is nobody to scoop up the food. What about the fire? - Just leave it. Şahin, why does it smell so bad here? - Because they pee. All summer long their children pee here. Look at all these flies. "Where can you earn money in just 30 seconds? At Binomo of course. Register and..." Who gives money away in 30 seconds? Do you think Lille can win? The odds are 1.70. Who are they playing against? - Angers. What are the odds for more than 2.5 goals? - That won't happen. I've taken Dostoyevsky as my role model. - So he trapped you into gambling? You need to stop. - Dostoyevsky was a gambler too. Yeah. Gambling is the only way to be like him. Nowadays I barely read. - Reading books is harmful anyway. I noticed that with you. - Why? Because you start questioning everything since you read. Didn't I do that before? - Look. My honest opinion about readers.... Readers go to the forest to read a made-up story. After reading, they start questioning God. "Why is the sea blue?" or "Why is the sky as it is?" Allah created it. That's all there is to it. Why do you act like this? - I like it. Get a grip on yourself. You are on the wrong path. How many people have you saved today? How many people did you save? - No one. Why? Why aren't you motivated? I don't know, Şahin. I don't have any lust for life at all. I even couldn't save someone who's drowning. Is that our pontoon? - No, it's the one from the watersports. Hakan, I'm leaving. You are totally lifeless. Is it cold? - In the morning and the evening. In Urfa, it's very cold. Say hello to Mom. - Close the window. Use the blanket. - Alright. Look at Dad. Ismail. - How are you, Dad? Just sitting around. Brother... - What? This time I won't put my wage on your deposit, because I will come shortly. I will bring my salary. Okay. Do you have anything else to say? Brother... I'm going to buy two pairs of trousers. What? - Trousers. Trousers? - Yeah. When I get my wage. Don't buy them. You can get them here. Okay. Have you learned to make soup? - Yes, I have. What? - I make soup. How's the waist? Good. - Let me take a look. Very nice. These beautiful pants just arrived. How is the waist of these pants? Very nice. The style is very beautiful: slim fit. Beautiful. - Beautiful. I buy this one. A good decision. Enjoy it. See you later. Have a nice evening. Be careful. If security catches us, they throw us out. The melody is beautiful. - Yes, the melody lingers. I don't want this night to end. ...for personal reasons I resign from 24/10/2018... Only signature. Tell me about the things you did. What changed? I developed myself. - In what areas? Concerning döner. And I know now how to make soup. So you developed in the kitchen? - Indeed. Good. What else? Have you made friends here? - Yes. With whom? With the lifeguards. Hakan, Şahin... - Nice. You'll be back with us next year? - If possible. Then you will. I'll tell you now. Go with your brother to another place, but I don't recommend it. I really don't. Don't walk in your brother's footsteps. Make decisions for yourself, not for others. Give me your phone. Look. Look at what you became in one season. Does your hair look bad? You didn't care if your hair looked messy when you came here. You didn't care about your hair. What happened? What changed? Many things. I just took a picture of you? - Yes. Look at it and compare it to the one from your arrival. You now have a bracelet. - Yes. When you go back home you will be taking over the place. You've seen it all here. That's good. I'm happy for you. I hope you succeed. I believe you will. You have the potential. - Thank you. Take care of yourself. Good luck. See you. - See you. What has changed? Take a look. See if anything has changed? More of my hair has fallen out. More of your hair has fallen out? That's all. - I didn't cause it. You're the cause of it. I didn't hire you so you would lose hair. - Yes. Give me a reason to ask you back next season. I don't plan to come. Why not? I didn't like this environment. How is your phobia? My phobia is not as bad as it was. At least we've gained one person. Right? On the contrary, I feel I've lost myself here. - Here? I think I turned into a superficial person here. You made it superficial yourself. I'm the largest contributor, but one can only resist that much. I'm like an object. Just doing my job. Like an automaton. I do my job and go. If one is always in this setting... one starts to see oneself through their eyes. Rather than being an individual... I'm just a piece within this system. That's all. That's all I am. You don't want to be a slave of the system. But... there is no system. You don't see this. The customers also have lives. And they pay certain prices to live it. No one values each other. Everyone is self-centered. Of course. Welcome to the 21st century. If this is the 21st century... What's important for me is that I've just discovered it. I used to be a person with virtues. Something happened here. The fact that I'm constantly confronted with trivialities leads me to hide certain things. I never used to hide anything. For example, someone had an accident on my slide. I had to warn them, but I didn't. Şahin said: "Tell me something so I can defend you." He wanted to help me, but I said: "No, I didn't warn them." "Write exactly like it happened." But now I might lie too. Now I take the easy path because what I used to do was not valued. It's worthless. Honesty is not valued. It has no significance. Fill in and sign. Reason for resignation? Private reasons. So you don't want me to call you next year? - No. Here too, right? - Yes. Hakan, are you aware? - Of what? Your self-confidence. Perhaps. A determined Hakan. Welcome. Welcome to the world. Good. I succeeded in this, right? I'm very glad. Take this. Is it dirty? Hamburger. Turkey... Hamburger. Turkey. Pig? - Yes, big. "Gulu gulu." - No, turkey. What did you do during winter? - I was in Urfa. I have rested for a month. I didn't do anything. Such a luxury. I felt at home here and suddenly I fell into a black hole when I was there with those people. What about the people? - They are naive and slow. Slow? - How shall I explain? They are dull. They have no ambition. They are empty. Why did you come back to Nashira hotel? You didn't want to. After the hotel, I worked in construction. Heavy? - Very heavy. I consider going back to university to study philosophy. What do you think? Very smart decision. By working in the hotel a few months, I want to save some money. I have the feeling I became sneaky. Not really sneaky, but selfish. Understood? To purify myself, I need to go to university. In this environment... one can't protect his virtue. I attached it well. They say that you can repair fishing rods very well, Ismail. Put your hand away.
