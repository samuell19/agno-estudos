You know, your house ain't that up to par, you ain't gonna see it in Better Homes and Gardens and shit like that, so I said it's cool. But I didn't know. Why the fuck you buy home insurance you ain't got no house? - You wasn't saying that when you was selling it, you was like this is good, if something happen. - Well fuck that, what, hey.

It ain't no 24 track, but it's cool what I have, you know. Little rap thing, it's not really like, you would say it was gangster, but it's not really like gangster, 'cause if you look deep, it's a message. It's like, you know, bust a nigga in the head, but then, pick him up. - Right, right. - Bust him again and I he keep fuckin' with ya, bust him again. So just, you know, not gangster, but.

Old girl kinda wacko. - I guess, you could say she's crazy about you. - She been trippin' like that all day. That's why I had to throw her psycho ass out. - You wanna talk about it? - Talk about what? - Whatever's on your mind. - Well, I know you had done said you don't wanna talk about it, but, what's the odds of you and Big Spay getting back together? - Big Spay? Slim and none, and I threw Slim out with a pair of raggedy drawers last week. Come on, hell would have to freeze over. - So basically you saying the odds of y'all reuniting like Peaches and Herb ain't good? - I didn't know you were a genius. - Uh huh. - Ooh. That's bad. - That low down dirty trifling, look Cedric, just don't get me started. I mean I was really hurt at first. But you know, I'm over it now. I just don't want nothing to do with his trifling ass. I mean, but I ain't tripping, though. I think I got a crush on somebody new. - Well, you know, I'm sure this somebody new is really cool, but I mean, you and Big Spay got like a month and a half invested into a relationship. That's a lot of relationship to just be throwing away. - Look, I agree with the first part of your statement. This guy is pretty special. I mean, you know, he's sensitive and sexy. He takes the time to ask me what my favorite color is. He knows that when I grow up, I wanna be an interior decorator. And he even knows that I like to fry fish and bake brownies in nothing but my panties. - Well that ain't saying a whole lot, I know all that. - Exactly.

Dude, stay on your J O B. Nobody's allowed in the house but me. - Look man, I'm sorry. They must have slipped in when I went to go get something to eat, man, you can count on me. Nobody else is getting in, I got this. - Thanks, bud. What the? Aww, ain't she just the sweetest little chocolate titty dropping? "The candy kisses line the floor "because I kiss the ground you walk on. "The big kiss on your pillow symbolizes "the big kiss I can't wait to give you in your bed. "Because you been playing host all day, "I know you haven't had a chance to eat, "so I made you something special and left it "on the kitchen table for you. "Hugs and kisses, your baby." Ohh, ohh, ohh. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmhmm. (hip hop music) Mmm. Put a foot in that, yeah. Ooh, yeah. Mmmhmm. - Hello, sexy. - What? This is re-goddamn-diculous.

That's just what I did. - I understand. - Yeah, shit. - Well, then, I'm sorry about what happened to your fish, Bernard. - Well, you know, I was kinda hoping that we could have a ceremony for him and bury him in the backyard. - Aww. Wait a minute, I thought you said you ate him? - Well I did. But then I scooped him out the toilet. - Oh, God, I think I just lost my appetite. - What, it was? Surprised I found little Bernard, camouflaged in all that shit. (crying) Bernard, rest in peace. This is for you, dead homey. (crying) Why you had to leave me?

Get yo ass down here. - See, it all started 'cause I had owed this gangster girl some money, and then 'cause they, well they. - Cedric, all I wanna tell you is my house looks great. - See, that's what I'm trying to tell you. - I know I told you don't touch nothing, but the way you moved stuff around and cleaned up a little bit, boy, ha ha, my house looks good, mmhmm. Your new mama likes it, too. Well, she would tell you herself, but she's upstairs changing into something a little bit more comfortable so we can get into some romantic energy we couldn't get into because we were traveling with the world's ugliest monkey. King Kong, Mighty Joe Young, Magilla Gorilla ain't got nothing on the ugly on this monkey. But I'll tell you about that later. Good job, boy, good job, good job. Boy, I love that boy, I love my house. Reminds me of House Party. I love that movie, boy. Coming baby, Chocolate Thunder is coming. - Oh, that's funny as hell. Apparently my girl, Cheyenne, had had insomnia all night and stayed up cleaning and redecorating pops' new house. After all this drama and excitement, I didn't have no money. I owe MoMo money, I owe my daddy money and I owe five-oh money. I knew if I didn't come up with some fast cash to pay these debts off my ass, MoMo would bust a cap in my ass, pops would whoop my black ass, and police would put my nigga-ass under the jail. So, I gotta do what I gotta do to get the money. - Yeah, mmmmm. - Ahhhhh. Facts is the facts. - [Director] Marker and play. Action. - I'll take a bucket of chitlins, some yams and two sweet potato pies. - Stupid ass. - Gimme some collard greens, some pig feet and some licorice. Gimme some neck bones, some yams and some jawbreakers. Gimme a bag of skittles, some chocolate chip cookies and some hoes. (gurgling) (laughter) - What's up, man? Look, I been selling internet to everybody else, but I know this dentist. You need to see my dentist, nigga. - I know you, you the same one that hooked me up with that same insurance last time, dental insurance? Nigga, they fucked my shit up. - No, I think they could help you. We gonna pray for you, let's pray, let's, put our hands on this boy's teeth. ♪ Well, his teeth are rotten ♪ ♪ He got rotten teeth ♪ (laughter) Hold up. ("The Luau" by M. Scarborough) (hip hop music) - Oh hell no.
