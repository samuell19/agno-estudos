Hmm.. Heard you are breaking hearts of all guys. Hey.. that's not true. They all are lies. Don't I know? Look how shamelessly he is flirting. With that girl.. Hey.. hey.. hey.. Why the hell are you chewing my hair? Tell me something.. Sujatha! Hmm.. Will you give me a kiss? No.. no.. I won't. It won't look good if anyone sees us. Who cares? Let's go near that well. No..

RGV.. you there? What happened? Why are you in such a hurry? Sit for sometime. I'm sitting here from a long time. You dad shaved half my beard and left. Is this even fair? Why do you need alcohol? What will you get out of it? Whom are you nurturing? Seenanna, did you see that skinny woman? Look, how she is fuming. What will you get out of it? Look.. look! Isn't she Venkatesh's wife? Each one of you are useless. All you do is borrow money and drink more alcohol. You don't earn even a single penny. Give it here. Hey.. what is this? Don't you control your wife at all? She is making a mess here. No job.. nothing! What are you doing? Where are you? All you do is drink and roam around. Protesting across the streets, you guys think its great! You driving auto? He is washing utensils. Nonsense. Hang up the phone. First thrash this guy.. come on! Hit him with slippers. He has no shame. Come on.. beat him! Hey.. look look.. the old man fell down.

Greetings, Sir! What is it, Samarpan? You still have service, right? If everyone wants to retire voluntarily and get the job for their kids, how is it possible? Do you think this is a government job that things will be managed with money? I can't guarantee anything but I'll see what I can do. Arrange some money. We'll see. We waited for your arrival.. Guide me.. Oh Lord. I searched for your way.. This life is to serve you. If you quit the job you have and hand it over to him.. How are we going to survive? How can we trust that he will handle the job? It's upto you if you keep our family or break it. You put your angel to guard us for our safety. Protect us from temptation and save us in your grace. Hey.. Sampath is coming along with his gang. If you get caught, they will beat you to pulp. I'm leaving. Take care of your goat. Your cheeks are so soft just like bun. (Sujatha blushing) Yeah.. these cheeks.. Hey you! What are you guys doing here? Huh? What the hell is going on? What.. Sujatha? Is this how you behave and bring shame to our village? I don't know anything. He is stalking me, says he is in love with me. Is it true? Are you stalking her? I came for feeding my goat. I don't know anything. Why did you come to our village? Where is the other guy who was with you? Oh my god.. where is he? What are you looking for? What is it? I came to feed my goat. Catch this guy. Where are you slipping off? Come! Hey... hey..

Oh god, I'll pass the exams, you give me money first. Don't know what your problem is. Here. Take this money. Dad asked you to give it to Narsaiah uncle. Careful, don't lose it. What's this money for? Don't touch it. You're supposed to give it to uncle. Why are you giving him so much money? You've nothing to give me, but there is so much to give to others. That's none of your business. Take it straight to uncle and give to him. Don't roam here and there. Okay, I'll give. Hey.. Where are you going now? Wait till the prayer is complete. I'm come back quickly. Dad will be mad. Happy shores.. He is in a meeting, can't you see? That's ok. Our friend, Maidak called. What did he say? Pasha was caught teasing some girl. Oh god!

Sir.. sir.. sir! Hello, Seenanna! Where are you, bro? I'm at the railway gate. They thrashed our Pasha and forcing him for marriage. It's all chaos here. You please come here quickly. Hang up the phone. I'll be there in two minutes. I'll come and settle things. Calm down, dear.. calm down, it will be alright. What happened, son? Constable is asking fifty thousand rupees as bribe. They are saying that they won't let him go if we don't pay. Don't know what to do. We don't have it. What can we do, son? He never listens to us and now is in trouble.

What happened, son, tell me! They say he is sick and need to operate urgently. Oh god, what do we do now? Go, get the money. His condition is serious due to heavy drinking. They're going to put him in ICU. Oh my god, what do we do now? Can you borrow and bring the money? Go to cousin Lacchi and ask her. Why are you lost? Granny, do you have thin pin charger? To hell with your charging.. your grandpa is on death bed and all you worry about is charger. Go to Lacchi and get the money. You dont understand my phone is dead. And you are yelling at me. He is in the police station and scared, but you're worried about your money? Is this how you value our childhood friendship? Why are you greedy for money? If you give him money now, is he going anywhere? Won't he pay you back? Playing around is not right, when he is in need. RGV, don't you know? Didn't we go to Narsaiah uncle's house this morning? If I give this money here, what should I give to uncle? What should I tell my dad? Narsaiah uncle is out of town, right? Hey, Isaac! Listen! Get lost from here. To hell with it.. Why are you smiling? Say something and stop this, I beg you. Tell them there is nothing between us and we met casually. What? Keep quiet, nothing like that. I really like you. I love you. Let's get married. I'm stuck in this nonsense, unnecessarily.. Are you guys patroling or simply going to bed and sleeping? No, sir. We are patroling. You shouldn't bring these things to me.

Granny is crying so much. I wanted to call you guys since morning but my phone was dead. Nobody had thin pin charger. What thin pin charger? To hell with your thin pin. Why do you keep saying thin pin? Throw that stupid phone into the lake. Did you both eat anything? Yes! Old woman in the next ward gave us some beans curry and jawar roti. You are talking about operation, do you have money? Don't know, buddy! I called sister Lacchi this morning. But, it doesn't look like the money can be arranged by morning. You have some drink. I don't know what to do. No.. not at the hospital. It's okay.. you have some. You drink... No.. no.. When alcohol goes down the throat, your sorrow will come out of your eyes. Drink some more.

Why is nobody picking my call? Are you all playing games with me? You stop worrying. I'll set everything. Do something. Stop giving excuses. I want my money back. You say you don't have money. Where did you get the money to buy this goat? Eat.. eat my dear sweetheart! Sell this goat and pay everyone's money back. You eat! We just brought my grandfather back home from the hospital. Where can I get the money now? You know I don't have money. That's the reason you guys got it from him. If you ask money suddenly, where will I get it? Hey.. You guys forced me to give money in the name of friendship. But nobody is responding now. Now you give me all lame excuses. You don't get it. If my dad finds out, he'll kill me. All of this happened because of Sampath. Why are we fighting? That's true. Sampath is behind all this. This is all because of him, he should take the responsibility. He is right. You should get the money. I'm a married, don't involve me. Really? You remember now that you are married? Didn't you know it when you were going after that girl with the goat? You were saying, 'here, sweet heart, come sweetheart..'? Move, idiot! No, guys! Listen to me. I don't want to go. It'll become a mess. Come on, move.. Enough of your dramas. Let's find Sampath. Hey Sujatha! Is this true? About what? Everyone in town are talking that you are going to get married. Is it true? Of course, I will. If I find a rich guy, I'll definitely marry. Hey, what will happen to us if you marry someone else? Everyone will go mad. Above all, I'll go crazy first. Do whatever but give your friends' phone number. Hey.. he is here. Be careful. Slowly.. Huh.. after you go.. Sampath, you are dead in my hands today. You both plotted against me. Come on, Pasha. Hit him.. Hey.. wait.. Catch him.. he is running away. Hey Sampath.. Sampath, wait! Run.. don't get caught. Sampath.. wait! Sampath.. wait! Where are you running away? You both have toubled me unnecessarily. Sampath, wait.. You guys made a huge mess. It's all because of you.

Hey Sampath.. hey.. hey.. Kick these idiots.. (People grunting) Crush them.. Don't leave anyone. Sir, Do you know what he did? He teased our village girl, Sujatha.. He was bothering her even after she said no. That's when we took him, beat him and handed him over to the police. They bribed the police with fifty thousand rupees. Now they're blaming me. Whom did you give that money? Did you give it to me? You gave it to police, why are you asking me? How many will you cheat like this? How long continue this? If nobody questions. Cheating girls and talking like innocent, you idiot! Who is stalking? Who is cheating girls? Enquire You idiots, if it is about money, you should take it back. Why are you picking fights? How dare you beat out village boys? You lay your hands on our boys? How dare you? Are you guys playing games? You're all taking his side.What kind of justice is this?

Why don't you pick my call? I've been waiting for you since morning sitting here like a crazy woman. You don't give a damn about me. When you were not gonna come, why did you ask me to come? You're making me a fool and playing with me, do you even understand? Sireesha, please don't cry. I beg you. I didn't do it intentionally. I lost money. Don't know who stole it. I've been worried and running around since morning. That's why I didn't even pick your call. You stop crying, please, I beg you. Please stop. Don't I even look like a human to you? Will you even understand if I die? What are you saying ? You can take my deadbody along with you to Hyderabad You first go home. I'll come again and tell you everything. Go home. How could you even ask me to go home? It's all my mistake, Isaac, completely mine! Sireesha, please! I came after you wherever you asked me to like a fool. Now, you will obviously tell me to go home. Go, you go and party with your friends. Sireesha, don't say that. Please, listen to me. You leave me alone, Isaac. Go! You go home first, I'll tell you everything. Let me go. If you don't let me go, I will scream out loud. People will smash you. What are you saying? Why are you getting mad at me? Give me some time, I'll arrange everything. How long do you need? How much more? Do you need time till the baby in my womb grows bigger? Will you make arrangements after both our families find out? Then, I'll jump infront of a vehicle and die. You make arrangements. Why are you talking like a fool? Let's go home first. Come on, get up. Please! Leave my hand, Isaac. Let me go! You stop crying first. It will look awkward if someone sees. I beg you. I will apologize and touch your feet. Please. Come, let's go from here. Come. Get up! I'll set things right. No, Isaac! Let me go. Listen to me. Let's not see each other's faces ever again. We are done here. I should slap myself for trusting you and coming this far. Stop it, have you gone mad? Do you even understand what you are doing? Listen, if you are man enough, stop bluffing. Set things right and prove it to me. Forget about me until then. Sireesha.. Don't you dare come after me. Stop crying, I beg you. Listen to me. Don't come after me. You're not even listening to me.. Okay, let me drop you at your home. Stop. Don't you understand what I'm saying, you fool? Please, don't cry! Wait, I'll get the bike. Hop on quickly, sit! Hey Maidak, stay here. I'll be right back. Okay! Seenanna! Why is Seenanna here? Seenanna, you there? That's Seenanna's secret affair. Keep quiet. Stop now, dear. Someone is here. Go and check. Hey, what's the matter? Something urgent came up. We need your car. You need car? Lot of wedding arrangements are to be made, buddy! RGV's aunt is unwell it seems.

Okay, brother. Brother, please give the car keys! Yeah, let me get them for you. What is this? Looks like we came to work not for the car. Hey, shut up now. Seenanna is really great. He gave us the car as soon as we asked. That's nonsense.. Hey, Seenanna is coming! Seenanna is coming! Pasha, here, take the keys! Hey, handle the car carefully. Okay, brother. Plenty of wedding arrangements are still pending. Come back soon. Sure, brother. Okay, brother. Bye! Hey wait, wait. Yes? There is no petrol in the car. Fill the tank fully. Brother, would you give the money.. Come on, buddy, why would I ask money from you guys? He is 'Tiger' just for the namesake. But he never has any money. You guys are unnecessarily worrying. Silly fellas! He didn't even give us any money. What's this? Doesn't look like we are going in search of Sathi. Silly Sattire.. Mischievous acts with no shame Brother, did you see Sathi? Silly Sattire.. No, I didn't. Mischievous acts with no shame.. Exhausted and take a break.. Take a break! Take a break! Exhausted and take a break.. Take a break! Take a break! Falling in line, spitting.. Moving and letting go.. Did you see him? Back and forth of bad timing.. No.. No! Screaming, fighting.. Fumbling, rubbish.. Clumsy, Upside down.. A fish's heart beating.. Slowly, pain goes away.. Brother, wait for a minute.. did you see Sathi anywhere? Chaos causing an eruption.. No, brother. Didn't see him. Take a break.. Causing eruption! Take a break.. Causing eruption! Vasu, did Sathi happen to come here? Take a break. Erupted! Which Sathi? Take a break! Where did this dumb fellow go? He is making us go round and round since morning. Why will someone who stole money roam around these trees and jungles? Donno where he is wasted. Swollen and falling in danger.. Glimpse is difficult.. Heart is fluttering.. Laughing out loud.. Quickly peeping.. Love is lost.. Won't listen no matter what at the end.. Punching causing loud noise.. Life is torn.. Take a break! Life became a squall.. Take a break! Life is torn.. Take a break.. Take a break, take a break! Take a break.. Take a break, take a break! Hey, let us go back home. My wife already called me so many times. If I don't go home today, she is already suscpicious of me, she will make my life hell. We came searching this far. Let's go little further. Please try to understand. Is it bothering you to simply sit in the car? No, no. Let's go home. Where can we find him in this late night? Why can't we find him? Of course, we will. We didn't find him since morning, how can we find him now? I need money now. We should find him and I need my money back. If not, will you return me my money? You go alone searching for him. Who are you to tell that? I'll go to check. You won't find him. Unnecessary nuisance. Stop! Go search. Go to hell. Senseless argument, why would't he listen? Drive on.. Enough of this fighting. Lets go, hey, you coming or not? No.Go to hell. Hey, you stop. Come, you get in. You leave! Let him go. If he is so obsessed, leave him. Hey, hey.. Come on, stop now. Why are you fighting? Stop. Hey, get up. Hmm.. Get ready quickly. We've got to go out. (Sighs) What is it, Samarpan? What brings you here? Is everything ok? I'll tell. Want some tea? All is good. No need of tea now. Tell me, what was our first salary? We started at Rs. 20, didn't we? Yeah, that's right. Not more than that. Yeah, correct. It was Rs. 20. Yes, yes. That's it. Yes. For that Rs. 20, We wore heavy boots, helmet.. had no air to breathe, walked in the mud with trowels and tools in hand.. Yes. we worked hard to earn every single penny and survived. True! I decided to leave my job and get him into it. I sold my wife's bangles and gave him the money.. This idiot took it, gave that money to his friends and ruined everything. Hey, don't beat him. He lied to me that he gave the money to you. How can I not worry? He grew up like a buffalo but has no sense. Shouldn't he be aware how much his parents are worried? If I say anything, he gets upset. He won't even tell me whom he gave the money to. Shame on you! By the way, Narsaiah! Yes? How long do we have to give the money to Kishore sir? I think we have two weeks time. You listening?

I told him nicely to return my money. I asked him where my money is and that I need it very much. How else should I say? What money are you talking about? He would never do that. Grandma, the money Isaac lent to Sathi when grandfather was in hospital, he is yet to return. On top of it, he stole his money without his knowledge. Why would he steal the money? Isn't he your friend? Why are you blaming him? Why are you becoming so angry? You all are the same. I'm the fool here. Hey.. Stop the bike. Stop now. Stop the bike right now. Why? You all are same. Don't dare to see me again. Hey.. Isaac! Get lost. Hey.. Hey.. you coming or not? Sireesha dear! Yeah? Bring some tea. Keep it there. Come, sit! Brother, give me a 90 ml. Hello.. Sireesha! Sireesha, I wanna die! Don't allow anyone near my deadbody after I die. What are you saying? What happened? Why are you talking this nonsense? You are scaring me now. No one is understanding me. Sathi stole my money and now he is not returning. Are you drunk? Did you drink and call me? I'm in so much trouble, do you understand at all? You are drinking, having fun and calling me like a fool? Go on, you too, blame me! Isaac.... A groom came to see me, Isaac. If I'm forced to marry, I'll die. Do you understand my situation? Who is he? Your father find him or you found yourself? I'll kill you and your dad. I'll kill you both. I'll kill everyone in your family. Yes, kill.. kill me.. you'll at least understand then. I'm not doing it intentionally, Isaac! If you don't call me, what should I do? What am I supposed to think? You've no idea how much I'm worried, Isaac. Come on. Stop crying. You first, stop crying. Moreover you are pregnant. I love you so much, Sireesha! Sathi is back now. We'll get our money back. Let's go somewhere and get married. We don't need anyone. Just you and I. Just us. I don't know all that, Isaac. You get the money and come soon. Or else, I will die, not you! Shut up now and hang up the phone! Money.. money.. money. Everyone is only interested in money. To hell with my life. What happened, dear? Why are you crying? Huh? What happened? Won't you tell me? What's causing you so much pain? You're crying! Come on. You'll hurt your head. What's troubling you now? I'm here for you. What happened? Why are you crying now? Don't cry. Tell me what happened. Come on! Eat now. When we were newly married, your grandparents didn't get me any gifts. Daddy felt bad about it. He saved money and bought me those bangles. After that, I never took them off. After all these years, he asked me those bangles for the sake of your job. You have no fear. You don't have value for money. Whom did you give? What did you do with it? You've no job. You didn't even complete your studies. You're incapable of doing any job. All you do is, raoming around with friends and coming home late at night. Your father would be upset of course! Even girls are working and earning money now. I don't know what to say to you. Do you want more curry? All of you keep blaming me. I can't do anything, I'm incapable, I'm useless. If girls were efficient, you should have had a girl. Why did you have me? Why are you complaining now? I can't even eat in peace. As if I did it all on purpose. Where are you leaving? Food will be wasted unnecessarily. Come and finish it. All you worry is about food getting wasted but not because I'm leaving. Amazing! Eat.. You guys eat and stay happily. I don't want anything. You think I can't work? I'll show you what I can do. Hey.. Isaac.. Hey! What are you doing? What is this? Listen.. come here. Why were you not responding all these days for calls? Why are you dressed up like this, buddy? Need to talk to you.. come here. What's this tail? Hey.. we are talking to you. Come! You are looking strangely funny.. come.. come! Hey.. look.. uncle is here. Oh god! Move.. move.. drive quickly. Brother, have some tea! No, thank you. Please. It's hot. Please have it! Have some biscuits, too! Take this! Are these clothes new? They look different. Did daddy buy these for you? The hat looks wonderful, son! Your mom is asking. Why are you beating him? Tell your mom who bought these new clothes for you. Idiot.. come on, speak up! Brother.. Get up! No.. no, please stop! Don't beat our son. Why don't you even try to stop him from beating me? You want band? Who bought you new clothes? Please.. stop beating me, daddy! Come on, say something. Tell your mom. Come on.. Fool of an ass! You're beating so hard? He will get hurt. Beat him gently. I should kill him.. Please let go of my hair! Ouch! Let him go, brother! Will you ever get better? No daddy.. please stop! How many times should I tell you? Ouch.. When will you learn your lesson? Will you never get better? Daddy, please don't beat. It's hurting. What happened? Does it hurt? Does it? Yes Of course it hurts. What did you expect? When will stop roaming and behaving like an idiot? No.. brother! What did you do with the money? Brother..! Don't bother brother. You know nothing. You brought shame to me. I would've been happier, if you did the same job for brother. Won't you ever change? You ask about getting better, when I do it and work, you're beating me to pulp. Am I beating you so bad? Idiot! I'm a better person now, daddy! Again.. how dare you talk back at me? Ah.. Ouch.. I'll smash your face if you ever talk back at me. Get out of the house. Come back only if you bring the money. Please, daddy! Nobody bothers even after i change. Leave.. get lost! Okay, I'm leaving. Our son is leaving. Yes, let him go. Move, you get inside! Come. Dear, take these. Take this documents and return the money to your friends. You guys are childhood friends. You shouldn't ruin it. That's not fair. Return what's rightfully theirs. Come.. eat some food. I don't want it. Everybody blame me as if I did it on purpose. Brother, keep this with you. I'll collect later. Hey, why are you throwing away? I saw it. Sharing cool drink and cozying with each other, You guys are acting really well. You said you love me and now you are roaming with him? Sathi, don't assume things and over react. I'm warning you! Sathi, we'll talk later. Leave now. Hey.. you wait! If there is nothing going on, why didn't you pick my calls or meet me? What did you do with all my money? You guys left me all alone. Hey, what money are you talking about? Will tell you when we are ready for the shoot. We'll see then. I don't want any shoot with you, don't want love with you, don't want any song shoot. Give me my money back. You idiot! What money are you talking about? Whom did you give it to? Get lost from here. Rajitha and Rakesh betrayed me. They took all the money. Rajitha said that she loved me. She made me buy things for her. Now she is with Rakesh. When i asked them to return my money. Rakesh grabbed my collar and beat me infront of everyone.
