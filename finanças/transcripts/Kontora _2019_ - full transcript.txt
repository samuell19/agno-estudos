I'm home. Grandpa, my bicycle chain broke. It slipped again. I almost fell down. It was really scary. How should I go to school tomorrow? You want to eat lunch. I am also a bit hungry. Let's eat together. Grandpa. Grandpa. Grandpa. You'll catch a cold if you sleep there. Grandpa. What's wrong? Hey... Grandpa. Sora, I'm home. Is he drunk again? War diary 1945. January 2, 1945 My training officer hit my face twenty times and theinside of my mouth was cut in many places. I had been looking forward to eating zoni. Instead, I was swallowing blood. We all were punished because they suspected that we ate at farmers homes near the base to ease our hunger. In the midst of cold winter, we were forced to sit for seven hours on a cold concrete floor and they hit us on our buttocks with the club. Then each of us was called inside the officer room. As soon I entered the room, I was hit so hard that I could no longer see and fell on the floor. A friend of mine was thrown with his headfirst to the floor, lost consciousness and was sent to the hospital. He never returned. Tsuchiura naval air base. Two souls reside in my heart. After all, I am just a human being. Sometimes my chest pounds with excitement when I think of the day I will fly into the sky. I envy those science majors who remain and did not pass the draft. I long for the day I can return to my beloved parents when my service is over. I am here far away from home. Even when I die, no one will cry for me how lonely it is only to hear cicada cry. What the hell. I must be honest. Sexual desire is painful. - Where are you looking at?- I stare at myself longing for the physical unity. Then I fight it as dirty and ugly. It is my anger at not satisfying the desire. On the other hand, I dream of breathing of a lover, the smell of her sweat that excites you the smell of the body of the opposite sex, the touch of the warm body playing around without the feeling of shame. Perhaps it is a bad dream after reading a novel... I daily struggle with this pain. Conquer yourself, take control of yourself. I do not avoid sacrifice. Sora, breakfast is ready. Sora. What? Breakfast is ready. Hello uncle, it's been a while. Haru? I didn't know you were back. Yeah, last month. How's your father? Doing good as always. You here to pick up door panels? Sorry, it's not ready yet. I told your father it'll be delayed. No no. I am here to see if you're up for dinner. Why? Well, my father caught some fish recently so he thought he'd invite all his friends. I see. He must have caught some red snappers. Well then. I'd hate to disappoint him. Please don't forget to bring Sora. That I can't promise. You know how she is. Anyways I will try. It'd be nice to see her again. Ok got it. What time? Well. 5:00 p.m. Got it. Well then, I'll try to finish work early. Sorry to bother you. We'll be waiting then. Haru, wait. Come here. Is that your father's factory uniform? Yeah, I'm working for him again. What about Tokyo? Dancing and all. You can call it a good experience. I see. By the way I heard about your father's death. He used to say... that every day since the war ended he was living on borrowed time. He must be happy with his friends now. Sora and I are doing fine so don't feel sorry. I understand. Well, see you at dinner then. Got it. Say hello to your mother. Of course. I am drawn to the issues of loneliness, prayer and social responsibility but not love which to me is too remote at this time. There is a saying which probably refers to life symbolized by the cherry blossoms But I don't like that sort of purity of falling without hesitation. A human should not die easily. When I close my eyes... I see a lonely village I love. It is night, lights flicker in the village. Which sleeps under the blue shadow of stars. What if I get a day off and can go home? What a feeling it would be to read aloud the books in German! What I want most is to study foreign languages English, German and French. The other day, seven on the plane disappeared. I pray, these seven souls may rest in peace. Today another plane with seven soldierswent up in smoke right after they took off. All except one survived. I am not surprised by the way we are losing the war. Where is Japan going? "Buried my metal arm" It's been a while since we've done this. I'm sorry it took your father passing away for me to realize it. No need for more condolences. We both are getting by just fine. Right, Sora? Well I'm glad you have got your shop up and running again. But if you ever need any help, you just have to ask. What kind of help? You know financially or whatever. I appreciate the gesture but I don't think it will come to that. Good to hear that. So how's the sashimi? Sora, I didn't get a chance toask before but how are you doing? I'm fine as always. Thank you for the meal. My pleasure. You can come here anytime and I'll be happy to cook for you. I suppose you'll be graduatinghigh school next year. Yes. Have you thought aboutyour plans after? I might move to Tokyo. Tokyo? What are you going to do in Tokyo? It's none of your business. Who asked you. Look at her. She kept bugging me about going to Tokyo. I finally agreed and now look... What a waste of time. Sora, you should eat more. Where are you going? Sora. Don't worry about them. I am sorry about that... No problem. You ok? I have a good family, right? Yeah sure. I am sorry. Do you regret coming back? I don't want to think about it now. What about your dancing? That'll always be the dream I guess. Why do you want to go to Tokyo? Well, what's the other option? There must be something here. I don't want to live in this shit forever. Why? It's a fucking ghost town. Did you start smoking? Bring me some alcohol. But you're still underage. Hey. What are you, my mother? Just bring it already. I've been thinking. With your father gone now that house of yours must be too big for just you and Sora. Yeah. And what of it? I am just saying it must be hard to maintain. What are you getting at, just say it. Well, alright then. It's not the right time but anyway... Why don't you sell your house to me? Go bring some more sake. Well, how can I say this... With your old man kicking the bucket. Seriously why do you need that big house? And another thing. My employees could reallyuse some living quarters. I can buy it at any price you want. I mean, within reason. The best part is... I can even set you and Sora up ina nice apartment at no charge. Right? And about Sora. Once she graduates, she doesn'thave to go to Tokyo. You don't even have to worry about her future. I can train her and give her a job at my factory. Just graduating high school and wandering in Tokyo wouldn't land her a good job. What if she fucks around with bad guys in Tokyo? What are you going to do then? You know I saw it. Saw what? My grandfather's dead body. Let's talk about something else. It was so weird. Same day in the morning I was talking to him. But after school, he was dead as fuck. I don't know how to explain that feeling. How is school going? And... I didn't have this kind of feeling when my mom passed away. And... After my mom passed, Grandpa was the only one I could really connect with. So. That's why... And. I was closer to him than my dad. I know it's a bad thing to say but... What do you think? Want some? I don't know. Forget about it. I knew you wouldn't understand. - I am sorry. - It's ok. No one would understand me. I can't be like your grandfather but I'm here for you. Fuck it. Give it to me. Come here. What? Go stand there. I started practicing karate. Raise your hands. You are drunk. What are you doing? You are really drunk. You are drunk, right? Why don't you teach me your dance? - You dance like this right?- You are stupid. Really? Come on, teach me to dance. Teach me! Ok then, be my sparring partner. I don't expect an answer right now. Just take some time to think about it. Are you really serious? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. Listen up. You're unbelievable. My father's ashes are still warm and you're already after my property. You are taking it all wrong. I just thought it's a good offer for you. Shut up. I look like an idiot coming here. Is this a joke to you? Two factories Two houses Even goddamned hills. But you're just as hungry for more land as always. You haven't changed a bit. You know me. I like to eat. What? - I am leaving, thanks for the food.- Hey wait, I am sorry. Don't touch me. - You have to calm down.- Thanks for dinner. You've had too much to drink. Who was forcing me to drink? Why are you crying? Let's go inside. No! Why? You'll catch a cold, let's go in. No! One more time. Raise your hand. Fuck my short legs... - You are really drunk, let's go inside.- Shut up and leave me alone. You can't drive like this. Whatever I said inside was for your benefit. Think about it. Yoshiji, listen. It's for your benefit, not mine. Come on, don't say that. Sora, we're leaving. Just stay a bit longer while I call a cab. No need, Sora get in fast. For god sake, calm down and listen to me. Thank you for the lovely night, we had so much fun. If things get difficult at home, justknow we can help you. Go inside! Wait a minute. - What happened between you two?- None of your business. Get the fuck inside. What happened back there? He is a fucking asshole. What did he say? He was asking about buying our house. And what did you say? That I'd think about it. And where we're going to live then? Can you sit quite. Of course I will never sell the house. I am just worried that's all. Dad, watch out! There is a flashlight in the car. Turn it on. What should we do? What the hell are you doing? What? Can't you see he is unconscious? What are you doing? He looks like a homeless. He is not even wearing shoes. Did you see him? He was walkingbackwards and came out of nowhere. No, it's your fault! Why did you drive knowing that you are drunk. Look what you did... Not my fault. It's probably nothinghe hasn't dealt with before. Let's go. Leave me. We can't leave him like this. We need to call an ambulance. And get the police involved? - If he dies here, you'll be in bigger trouble.- Stay here then, I am leaving. Are you alright? Sora! Get in the car right now! Sora! What the hell are you doing? Don't worry, I will get some help. Seriously I will leave. Ok, leave then. Why are you so stubborn? Hurry up, get in. Leave him, he is not dead. Sora! Fuck! I am really sorry. Leave me. We have to bring him home if not a hospital. Ok got it, open the back trunk. Use the light. Not this, the back side. Hurry up. It happened because you were drunk. It doesn't matter. It does. - Because he was walking backwards.- That's just your excuse. Is he breathing? Yeah. Not on the sofa. Why? Because he stinks like a gutter. Hey. Are you ok? How dumb are you? - Walking backwards at night.- Leave him and go to bed. - Why what happened?- Just go sleep off the alcohol. God damn it. Now the whole housesmells like shit. Fart bombs... Are you serious? Just wait a moment. Sorry, it must be painful. Do you remember we saw each other this morning? You were walking backwardsand I was on the bike. You can go now. Sorry about last night. The accident. I think this should make up for it. No need to talk to the police. You look fine now. Right? What are you doing? Are you stupid? Not that way. I give up. Watch your step. Why can't you walk like a normal person? You must have a death wish. Where is he? He left early morning. How did he go? By walking. If you can call it walking. You kicked him out. Didn't you? I actually gave him some money. He will be fine. Breakfast. Running late for karate practice. Eat your rice. There is miso soup as well. Sora! Come with me. Come this way. Relax. He's at work now. Do you remember what happened last night? The car accident. No? You got hit by my father's car. Can't remember? Do you understand what I am saying? Eat first, you must be hungry. But, can you hear me? You can't use chopsticks? Can you read? Do you have some kind of job? Or do you just wander around? I'm really curious to know why you walk backwards. Any specific reason? Hey. Do you live around here? In these tattered clothes. No socks or shoes. Where are you going? Hey? Wash your hands. It's alright. Do you want to have a bath? What the hell are you doing? Sit here. Still hungry? Use chopsticks though. Here you go. I know you can understand what I'm saying. Listen. I want you to write something. Can you read kanji? My name is Yamada Sora What is your name? Please write here. Just a moment. Finally, you look like a human. These are my grandpa's He is dead, so you can use them. Sorry that my father kicked you out. Take them. I will apply some medicine. How long are you going to act mute? I heard you singing. Why are you crying? What? Why? I am sorry. Because I gave you old clothes? Do you prefer new ones? I am sorry. Tell me why you're crying? What's the matter? Do you want new clothes? Sorry I searched. But these are all I could find. I hope you like them. Please accept these. Do you want anything else? More food? No? Got it. Please change your clothes. So where you are heading next? Is there anything else I can do? Do you want some money? I only have some changes. You can take them if you want. Do you have a death wish or something? I have somewhere to be. So this is it. Sorry again for my father's behaviour. So. You go that way. And I'll go this way. Pull with both hands. Be careful. Coming through. Bit more on the right. Move the handle. I'm home. Sora. Excuse me. Do you know where Haru is? She should be there. Haru. What are you doing here? Did you see Sora today? What? Wait. What happened? Did you see Sora today? Sora? Hey, what's going on? Did you guys see Sora today? Not today. Did she come here? Why would she come here? She didn't come back from school. What? Uncle. Please wait. What's going on? Can you just calm down and tellus what's wrong. Have you seen a backward walking man? What the hell. I am sure something is wrong. If you see a backward walking man, don't let him go and let me know. Please. I am coming with you. Haru, where the hell are you going? I'll be back soon. Are you sure? Backward walking my ass. Hey uncle. Can you explain now? Remember yesterday night? Your fight with my father? That doesn't matter. On the way back home I hit a homeless man with my car. It was not a big accident. Well. This stupid homeless man, walking backwards ran into my car. My car just brushed him. He just got some scratches. Sora was also there. So we brought him home. Took care of him. But. He was a weird person. Never spoke a single word. Could only walk backwards. Smelled like shit. That's why I kicked him out early this morning. When I went back home after work I found out that he had been in my house again. I don't get what you are saying. Where is it? Uncle is that him? The backward walking man. That's him. Yes, there he is. Uncle wait. Uncle. Uncle! Wait! Just wait. Uncle no! Uncle wait. What are you doing? Fuck! Come here. Please calm down. Don't let him go. Don't hurt him. Please stop. How did you find my father's clothes? Where is Sora? I am sure you know it. Why don't you first calm down? You know where Sora is, right? What did you do to her! You remember Sora, right? Tell me. We can't find her. Tell us something. If you don't tell us... we will call the police. I know he won't speak. But I can tell you he knows something. I am sure about it. Until I find Sora. You are coming with me. You piece of shit! Let's go. - Please wait, calm down.-Stand up. Both of you... Stop it! We just want to find Sora. Shut up and follow me. I am not going to hurt you, calm down. I am just looking for Sora. Say something asshole! Fuck you! Keep quiet. Shut the fuck up! What is it? What are you saying? What the hell. What's your problem? Fuck you grandpa! Haru, shut him up for god sake. Is it Sora? Are you ok? Let's go home. The factory is closer, let's go there. Ok. Haru please sit with her. Are you ready to talk now? You have to tell me what's going on. Who gave him grandfather's clothes? This is grandfather's, too. Why you have this thing? - Explain to me.- Can you just shut up? Why did you beat him? Beat him? Because he was acting weird. What do you mean? He saw me and started running. That's why I had to. Why is he wet? Because this idiot ran into the river. Can't you see I am wet too? I gave him grandpa's clothes. Why? Because you kicked him out. Kicked him out? There was no reason to let him stay. You hit him with the car. He looks perfectly fine to me. You have no feelings, not even for me. How can you say that? Every parent cares for their kids. You are the only one I have. What is it? Sora! Let her go. Where are you going? - Sora!- I'll go talk to her. What the hell is that? My father's diary. So this is why she went to the forest? Can I... just see it. I have to talk to Sora. "Buried my metal arm" I'm sorry about the trouble we caused. No no. I'm just glad Sora is safe. Yeah. Well then. We are leaving. Sorry again. Not a problem. Where is the diary? This thing? I didn't know your father hadthis kind of artistic talent. Me neither to be honest. Really? It almost looks like he left a message for you. I doubt that. It's just wartime sketches. Yeah sure. Ok then. Hey. Why don't you come with us? Let's go home. Some interesting stuff in here. Why didn't you show this to me? When grandpa died... I found it close to him. Then... Suddenly I heard your car. I panicked and hid it. You could have shown it to me after. Well... I had no excitement in my life. What? But after I saw this diary... I felt like I found my purpose And I didn't want to share it with anyone. I see. The war destroyed everything. Did Grandpa ever showed you this diary? Never! Diaries suppose to be a personal thing, right? But these sketches are so beautiful. I wonder why he never showed me. So was he a pilot? Yes, that's all I knew. But... He never shared all these stories from the war. Is that so? Grandpa must have gone through a lot. I guess he sketched and kept notes ofwhatever he saw and felt in the war. You are not that matured to read all this. What does this mean... This one right here. "Buried my metal arm" That means he buried something there. I don't think so. Do you really think something's buried? I see. How long have you been searching? About four days. Four days? So you skipped school? Where did you search? Hachiman. Hachiman shrine? Around Obora. Obora? Mountain area. I see. Around the hills. Ok. And here and there. I see. How did you search? Mostly digging around. Digging... That's why you were in that forest with a metal crowbar. Let's make a deal. If you promise not to miss school anymore I will think about helping you. - This is more important than school! - You should know that more than anyone! Why are you... - So irritated.- I am not irritated! That buried stuff is not going anywhere. I don't understand why it's not important to you. Sometimes I wonder why you only cared about mom. What? Before we used to hang out together. It was really fun being around you. I get it. And lately, it's even worse. Why? Because you don't even look at me while we talk. I don't even know how to behave around you. I am sorry. I am trying my best. But I don't know what's wrong. That's why I envied grandfather. Because he actually listened to me. He was there when I wanted to talk about mom and my problems... And my feelings. Not like you at all. Sora. You know... I sometimes wished I could have the relationship with him that you had. For some reason, you twoalways just clicked together. It's not that he didn't try with me. But I guess... I couldn't do the same. I was too stubborn. Same like you and me now. I guess I understand now. So please don't cry. And now, can I tell you something? I probably know the place you are searching for. What? You were looking in the wrong places. If I am not wrong. It's somewhere behind the Funyoji temple. Funyoji... I used to play there when I was a kid. Really? - There used to be a dam there. - But now it's all dried up. Now it's abandoned. I guess. It was our playground. Anybody could access there easily? I guess this is the place. Only a few people knew this place. But first, what should we do with him? We should let him stay here at leastfor some time. I think that's fair. He looks happy already. Fine, but... When I am not at home. He can't stay here. Either he comes to my work. Or hang around nearby. Deal? Why are you reading this? Where are you going? Dad, not done yet? I am getting bored. Are you ignoring me? Dad. Are you listening? Of course, but first I have to finish this order. - Finish it fast.-I am doing my best. Hey, can you stop rotating like that? Why don't you listen to me? What is this? I have been looking for this. Because it's boring. Yes I get it, just 30 minutes. Give me just 30 minutes, I will wrap it up. Please stop rotating, it's giving me a headache. What's all this. Don't move, stay. Just wait for 30 minutes. Then let's go. Uncle, you there? Haru, what are you doing here? I think my father went to the forest. Which forest? I guess the one where Sora went. What are you talking about? You must have told him something. What? I don't even know what's going on. Hey, where are you going? Hold on, wait. You can't reach faster like that. Stop stop. Don't run, we can go by car. Fast. Yes, I know. Open the door. Just get in. Get inside fast. All in? Yes. There it is. That's your father's car. - Right?- Yes Let's go. Dig faster, we don't have much time. Try to dig this side. More towards the left. Right there. Hey! Sora! Calm down. Assholes! Shut up! Stay here. Shut up. Yoshiji, can I ask you what's going on here. I'm simply carrying out some work on my land. Your land? May I ask, why you are trespassing here? We have some important work to finish. I let your daughter off yesterday but this can't continue. Stop doing that! Hey tall guy, stop it! Yoshiji, don't you feel nostalgic. We used to play here. I can't remember. Good old days. We were innocent back then. Now things have changed. What the hell. This is my request as your cousin. Cousin? I haven't forgotten your recent behaviour and words towards me. That has nothing to do with this. I am requesting you to leave. Is this really something you'reprepared to make trouble over? I can sue your ass. I've forgiven your daughter for trespassing twice already. I wonder, how good of a lawyeryou can afford now. Dad, why are you behaving like this. Shut up and go home. Whatever is necessary. What is that freak doing? What the... You are really crazy. Don't fall asleep. You're crazier than I thought. What were you thinking? Stupid. This man... He looks happy though. Be careful. Hey, wait. Use this shovel. Don't dig with your hands. Sora! What is this? It's tied with strings. Can you untie it? Do it carefully. Ok. Slowly. Because we don't know what's inside. What if it goes "Boom." What do you mean? - I don't know.- Dynamite... Strings are really tight. There is one more here. Hold on. Be careful. This is it. Just a moment. Don't touch it. This is not a toy. And I am not a kid. What? Real bullets. Bullets? Don't touch them without asking me. Come on. Just hold on. What's this? This is a very old katana. The blade still looks sharp. Step back. So this is his "metal arm". Hey. Can you bring that oil? The small one there. Go get it. Bring that newspaper. Come on this side, it's dangerous. Come here. Be careful. Hold here. Like this. Hold tight around here. Don't touch there yet. Hold tighter. Don't put your finger on the trigger yet. Put the rifle butt on your shoulder. Bring your face closer. Press harder. Otherwise, you will dislocate your shoulder. After this, you'll go to school, ok? Got it? This is the last time you are touching the rifle. Got it. Ready? Finally... Be careful. Ready? Thank you. Thank you all. Don't eat like an animal. I am going to drink like a fish today. But you are already drunk. Because... Sora, it's your birthday. Thank you. See you later then. - Thank you, Sora-No problem Shall we? Did you eat the cake? Yes. That's good. Haru, where are you going? Haru, come here! Hey. Get up. I said get up. Come on fast. Stand up. Get on your feet. Now walk. Walk forward. Do it. Take a step towards me. You know what I mean. I know you can. This way. I said this way. I said walk forward, you want to die or what. Come on. Can't you hear me at once? Don't act like a dumbfuck. I will shoot you seriously. I know you can walk forward. Who are you? Tell me or I will shoot. You don't think I'll do it? I will fucking kill you. Stand up and walk forward. Or I will shoot myself. I swear. I am sorry. Look at your face. I was just joking. "Happy Birthday Sora"
