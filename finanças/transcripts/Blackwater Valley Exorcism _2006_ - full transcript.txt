[opening theme song] -[birds chirping] -[eerie music] Isabelle! [eerie music continues] [birds chirping continues] [shouts] Isabelle! [shouts] Isabelle! [crows cawing] Who the hell did that? [answers in Spanish] Look! [suspenseful music] Jesus Christ. What happened? [eerie music] [birds chirping] Are you okay? I'll call a doctor. [sighs] No... I just felt dizzy for a minute. Come on, sit down. Can I get you something? Some water? I'm fine. I'm just getting over the flu. It's a bad one. [giggles] It's been a long time. I just felt the need to come here today, Jacob, I'm glad you did. Despite the past, and everything that happened... You're always welcome here. I know that. I don't want you to think that... It's ancient history now, so... To some perhaps, I feel like it just happened yesterday. Sometimes we have to just go on with our lives. I miss you Jacob. Would you like to come inside? No, I'd better get going, and get some rest. It was really good to see you again Jacob. You too Claire. [car honking] [shouting] Get in the house! Get in the house! -What happened? -I don't know. I ate a rabbit. Oh god... Come on sweetheart, we're gonna get you cleaned up. [church music] [Man] Burning the midnight oil again I see? It's not that way is it? Bishop Meuller. So... [Meuller] I finally got a reply from the Vatican. They want you at the university in September. [Meuller] Out of all the applicants I submitted They want you. What would I be studying? Exorcism. I know. But they're looking for someone intelligent. -Who can deal with this problem. -[Jacob] Are you serious? Father, modern psychology-- It's not about psychology. With all due respect! I think I can serve better in the church, right here. [both sigh] I think you should pray. To our Lord, and ask him to help you with this decision. I don't need to pray. My answer is no. [soft music] [action music] [knocking on door] Hey, Jimmy. How's it going? [Jimmy] Hey Isabelle. How's my girl? Izzy, Say hi to the sheriff, honey. He made me do it. Who made you do... What honey? He was inside me. Who was sweetheart? Who was inside you? Blanche... Listen to me. I need to talk to you. If you wouldn't mind, I need to talk to Isabelle alone for a few minutes. Isabelle? honey... Your mom is gone now. Is there anything you want to tell me? Was it the boys? The ones that found you? Did they do something that they shouldn't? [sighs] How about here at home? Is there something going on here that I should know about? [tense music] Can I ask you a question, Sheriff? Sure, anything. Have you been doing things that you shouldn't be doing? I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do. Take my hand, and I'll show you. [tense music continues] You've been a naughty, naughty sheriff. [tense music crescendo] [car door slams shut] [hard smack] -[Sheriff yelling] -[girl screaming and weeping] [crying] [girl begging] [Sheriff] Be nice... How did you...? Did that little bitch tell you? [deep voice] You want me to show you more of your misdeeds Sheriff? Leave this ranch and never come back. [Isabell with a deep voice] You understand me? -You're not gonna tell? -Get out! I’ve got important business here, you're interfering! Get out! [loud slam] [birds chirping] [Man calls out] Jimmy! Jimmy! Where are you going? What the hell, Jimmy? [car engine revs] [joyful music] [horse neighing] Thank you so much for coming out. I've got nothing better to do on a Sunday. [patting] There you go girl, you'll be better in no time. Thanks Doc... How are you doing, Eli? You seem distracted, everything alright? [crying] I don't even know where to start. Isabelle? Isabelle what are you doing? It's inside me mommy, I have to get it out. [heavy breathing] It's been going on almost a month now. Doctors have ruled out schizophrenia and that... Bipolar bullshit. I was watching that Oprah show one time, and she had this guy on, who said that when kids do bad things, and sometimes to themselves, that it's just a cry for help. I've never been that touchy feely guy Joe, you know Not even to my own kids. Kids are like animals. They just need a little positive reinforcement. [tension music] [screaming] Let me go and get my checkbook, I got to get you paid. Hey, hey, hey. Don't bother, okay? You're really having a tough time, I'll get it later okay? [Blanche screaming] Stop it! You're hurting me! You're useless. Dad doesn’t want you anymore. Because you're so old and ugly. Blanche? [Blanche screaming] [blanche continues screaming] Isabelle no! [Isabelle] Get your hands off me!! [Eli] Stop! You stop! stop! Are you going to tell her daddy? Are you gonna tell her, that you used to touch me? Don't you say that. [screaming] Come on! Tell her! That's a lie. Tell her dad! [tense music gains momentum] [Isabelle screaming] Okay, okay, It's locked. Oh my god. [heavy breathing] Wait! [breathing heavily] This is bad, listen I need you. Isabelle cut herself all up. She's lost her mind. Oh man, what-- She accused me, in front of Blanche of molesting her. Let me take a look. [sighs] Oh man... [groans in pain] I don't think you need stitches, but... We should get you into a doctor, for some x-rays. I'm not going to leave my daughter alone. You got anything we can sedate Isabelle with? I'm a veterinarian, Eli, not a doctor. Listen to me... I don't have time for a doctor. I have some horse tranquilizer. Is it safe for people? Well, it should be. If this ever leaves this room, they'd yank my license so fast... You have nothing to be worried about, Doc. okay? Okay. well... I guess it's time we gave your daughter, a little prick. Are you ready? -[door unlocks] -Isabelle honey It's daddy. And look I brought a friend. It's doctor Mcall, do you remember him? [eerie music] He took care of your horses, since you were a little girl. He's like family, he came to say Hi. [Eli] You remember doctor Mcall? Hello there, Izzy. Izzidabell, remember? That's what I called you. I was out here looking at your Phillies. They're nice, you got a favorite? [tense music] No? Well, uhm... Look we need to... Have you get back on your feet. Give me your hand. There you go. We'll get you to get some rest, okay? Let's just count back from ten, okay? [doctor groans in pain] Isabelle, don't! Doc! -[Eli screaming] -[doctor groaning] [sarcastic laughter] Doc? Blanche. What happened? [crying] I don't know. That's not my daughter in there. That's not the daughter I know. [crying continues] What are you doing? I just came by to see if you needed some help. I do, I need it here. [church music] [suspenseful music] [strange voice] -[soft guitar music] -[horse neighing] How long she's been acting like this? I don't know. She's been having some troubles lately. This thing we saw today, no one knows what to do. [tense music] Migel! Hello, Señor Barber. [sniffles] [Ely] Migel, now is not a good time for me. I've got a family crisis going on. Yes, I understand. You'll get your pay on Friday. I must see your daughter. Why? Please... I must see her. How is it that you think you can help my daughter. I have seen this kind of thing before. [suspenseful music] You've come to touch me again daddy? Isabelle... Isabelle, please don't say that. Daddy, I'm so horny. Come to me the way you like it. Both of you. -Leave now, Mr Barber. -No. [Eli] I'm not leaving you alone with her, Not when she's acting like this. -Get out! -No. [screaming] Get out! [tense music] So you know Psalms 65. [deep voice] Psalms 67! [praying in Spanish] [Tense music continues] [Blanche sighs] [footsteps] She's sleeping now. She's okay? Does your daughter speak Latin? No, no way. Why are you asking? You don't need a doctor. Just a priest. -[eerie music] -[birds chirping] Let me take your coat. Thank you. Can I get you some coffee or tea? Some tea would be good. Some milk and sugar. Three, if it's no problem. [Blanche] It's not a problem at all. I'll be right back. Don't worry about doctor Mcall. He's sleeping off a Bender. Look, I'm not gonna bother with mall talk What's going on here? Sit down. Isabelle is going crazy. One minute she's winning the question trophies, and getting ready for her prom. And the next minute... She’s gutting wild animals with her bare hands... And asking me... To touch her. -Have you been to see a doctor? -[Eli] You wanna see the list? It's as long as your arm, father. She keeps getting worse. So you were Blanche's idea? Personally... You'd be the last guy I would ever invite to this dance. You've caused my family enough grief. Let's keep this about Isabelle. Alright. Now, are we talking about possession? Maybe. I don't know anything until we conduct a proper evaluation. I don't give two shits about your diagnosis. I want my baby back. [cries] Please bring my daughter back. Jacob...Is that you? Yes. Nice costume. How are you doing Belle? I don't understand why they're treating me like this. I haven't done anything wrong. They're saying you're dangerous. [tense music] Dangerous to yourself and to others. I've missed you Jacob. I never told anybody. About what? [Jacob] Whoa. [chuckles] Sorry Isabelle. It's Ok, Jacob. I didn't mean to... You like what you see? You're a very beautiful girl Isabelle. It's lonely in here. Do you want to join me? Nobody needs to know our little secret. I want you. [moans] Lord, have mercy on you, Isabelle! [praying] Lord, have mercy on this innocent child. [laughs] I don't know how to tell you this. -Cause' I don't-- -Just spit it out. I think an exorcism might be in order here. I knew it. She's possessed. Blanche...please. Are you telling me, the devil's in my daughter? Not Satan himself. But it is a demon of some kind. She's showing all the signs. So what do we do now? I need to make a call. [phone ringing] We have an emergency. Jacob? The young girl Isabelle, she is showing all the signs. What are you talking about? I'm talking about possession. She's displaying supernatural strength. She's fluent in Latin, and speaking in a voice... It's a terrible voice. It's not the voice of a young woman Alright Jacob look, calm down. Father, I need help out here, immediately. [whispering] I'm not ready for this. Jacob listen to me, If what you say is true, I need to call Cardinal Bennett first thing in the morning. He's the only one that could possibly-- [electric shock] [soft music] How's Isabelle doing? I don't know. How's Blanche holding up? She's hanging in there. -look... -[sighs] If there's anything I can do to help. [Eli[ Look? Why are you so interested in my wife's welfare!? I've seen the way you look at her, the way you touch her... Don't play me for a fool, Luke. I'll beat your-- Get your hands off me! -You got it all wrong, Eli. -Do I? Blanche is a lovely lady, no question. But I'm in love with your daughter. My daughter? Isabelle. I love her Eli. Have you touched her? Have you been with her? Is she still a virgin? -That's none of your business! -The hell it's not, [yelling] She's barely 18! -[smack] -[grunts] I know you've been going through a tough time lately, boss. But don't you ever do that again. I'm sorry, alright? -[tense music] -I understand. I forgive you. She is my baby. She's the baby of my family. She'll be alright. Mark my words. Yeah, well I hope you're right. As far as Blanche's concern... you're lucky to have her. Even though you treat her like dirt. [yelling] Hey, I am true to her! But do you love her? The phone's down. But I did manage to reach the bishop. He's gonna consult with the Vatican before we can do anything. Come on Jacob! You can do better than that. My Belle is dying in there. Sorry Blanche. Until I get permission from the bishop, my hands are tied. With no phone, I can't receive any calls. I have to get back to the church. I don't have a good feeling about this. Please? Stay. The best thing you can do is check her into a psychiatric hospital. I'll call you when I know more. I wish I could do more Blanche. I'm sorry. Goodnight. You know I've been disappointed in you before Jacob. I guess I'm just getting used to it. What are you doing? You're not leaving until you help Isabelle. I already told Blanche, I can't do anything until I talk to the Vatican. [yelling] The Vatican can go to hell. Put that white collar to use and get the devil outta Isabelle. I don't even have what I need. [Luke] Improvise. [horse neighing] [suspenseful music] [Jacob] I can't do anything with you pointing that gun at me. You want to help Isabelle or not? Go back inside and wait. I need to speak to Miguel, on my own. [Luke] Don't disappoint me,padre. Meantime... I'm gonna hold on to these. Migel? [heavy breathing] I'm Jacop. I know who you are. What do you want? Blanche. You told her, she needed a priest. [suspenseful music] -Get back! -[screams] Claire. I didn't mean to scare you. What are you doing with that gun? Nothing, Long story. Dad! What's going on? [sighs] Come inside. What do you know about exorcism Migel? -Not much. -How much? I saw one. Long time ago. What happened? He was an old man... The demon was inside him. Was it successful? [horse neighing in the background] We did what we could. But it wasn't enough. The old man died of a heart attack. Who led the ritual? I did. Mom? [soft music] Sweetheart! Claire what are you doing here? I don't know, I couldn't sleep. I was having terrible dreams, and nightmares about Isabelle. I can't explain it. I got worried, and I was calling over here, and I couldn't get through so I drove over. Where is your car? I had a friend drive me. Where is Isabelle? What's going on? I think you should tell her. Your sister is very sick Claire. It's a part of a life I left behind a long time ago. You don't want me in that room, that I can promise you. I need you help, Miguel. I can't do this alone. You're the only one here that has done anything like this. Jacop's here? Now? The padre is here. Down at the bunkhouse, talking to Miguel. Blanche... you need to get some rest. We've got things under control here. I guess a few winks isn't going to hurt. Wake me if I can do anything. [Eli] We will. Do you trust me? Why should I? If you have any faith in our lord Jesus Christ, you have to do everything you can to help Isabelle. I’m sorry, but I want no part of it. Why? I don't understand. Why? To perform an exorcism you have to be strong. You have to be free of guilt or sin. The demon will use your weaknesses against you. Are you prepared Jacop? Are you ready for that? I'll make do. I'd like to help you. But I no longer believe in the church. What about our Lord Jesus Christ? If there's a god... Then he’s punishing me every goddamn day. [Claire] Are you sure you're ok mom? [sighs] I'm fine honey. Tell me what's really going on. You really think she is possessed? That's not my baby daughter in there, that's all I know. We'll figure it out. I promise. [sighs] Are you alright with Jacop being here? [scoffs] I don't know. If in any way he can help, then of course, yeah, but... I have my doubts. I just didn't know what else to do. It's alright. Mom, get some rest, okay? Lot of rest. [Miguel shouting] Wait! I'll do it. But only for her, not for God. Just what I need. A priest who doesn't believe in God. I have the Roman Ritual. Honey? [suspenseful music] Oh god...Isabelle? Honey? Honey It's daddy what are-- Isabelle please. What are you doing? Please let me help you. Give me you hand. Let me help you. Isabelle please! "Dear Blanche, please meet me privately. I need to talk to you. Please don't mention to Eli." [deep sigh] [moaning] [moaning continues] Stop it! [moaning] Stop it! Give me those letters. Give me those letters! Come on, Blanche. One isn't enough. [Blanche voiceless] You had a hard day today. A couple of more pills Isn't gonna hurt you. [Blanche with strange voice] Doesn't that feel better? Come on, a few more! Very good! And now you can rest. Isabelle, It's daddy sugar. It's going to be Ok I promise you. [hard smack] [clank] [Isabelle grunting] Get that priest in here! Asap! Human teeth are a chock full of bacteria. You ok Eli? I'm not feeling that great doc. . Yeah, I can't say I blame you. I'm surprised you haven’t gone off the deep end yourself. I didn't know you were here. She's my sister, Jacob. We just had a little wrestling match with Isabelle. What happened? She bit my father. What are we going to do next? I've a got a plan but I'm gonna need everybody's help. [Inspirational music] [Jacob] God's creature, salt, I cast out the demon from you by the living, God, by the true, God, by the holy, God. May you be a purified salt. May all evil fancies of the foul fiend, his malice and cunning, be driven afar from the place where you are sprinkled. And let every unclean spirit be repulsed by Him who is coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire. May this salt and water be mixed together. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen. We've got to talk. It's about you and Doc. So if you could, I need you to listen to me. Blanche wake up. Blanche get up. Blanche? Blanche? Oh god Blanche. [screaming] Doc! Get in here it's Blanche, hurry please! [Eli] Oh god, Doc! I need you! [Claire] What happened? [Eli] She swallowed a bunch of pills! [repeating] Get her over here! [All yelling] [vomiting] Good, that's my girl. [wolf howling] We're ready to begin. What else do you need? A medical doctor present. Well I guess, I'm the best you're gonna get. A member of the family. Blanche isn’t in any shape to go. Claire, you do it. I can stay with mom. They'll need someone way stronger than me. I can assure you, you're stronger than I am. Go. A female is preferred. Alright. Good, now everyone gather around. Now remember... It's very important, That no one has contact with Isabelle, except from me. [chanting] Now, we proceed with the prayers of exorcism. Let's do it. [tense music] [sizzling sounds] [yells in pain] I cast thee out, unclean spirit, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. I command thee to name thyself. What is your number, demon? When will you leave this poor creature of God? Never! [speaking with deep strange voice] Almighty Lord, Word of God the Father, Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation. I humbly call on your holy name in fear and trembling, asking that you grant me, your unworthy servant, the power to confront with confidence and resolution this cruel demon. See the cross of the lord. The stem of David, the lion of Juda's tribe has conquered. -Lord, heed my prayer. -And let my cry be heard by you. Let us pray. God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, I appeal to your holy name, humbly begging your kindness, that you graciously grant me help against this and every unclean spirit now tormenting this creature of yours. through Christ our Lord. [both] Amen. [chuckling] [demon's voice] What about you, Miguel? What’s hiding in your closet? Which of the cardinal sins do you employ? [incoherent talking with a deep voice] You let your family die! [shouting in Spanish] You're hurting Isabelle, that's what the demon wants. Doc! Doc! Get out! What happened to them Miguel? Nothing. Don't lie to me. The demon got to you. [sobbing] No. You said any guilt, shame or weakness would be exploited. [crying] Confess to me. They killed my family. [crying] I came home one night... my mother... My father, my sister and her two children. All dead. [crying continues] Each one... shot in the back of the head. Who did this? I’d been protesting against the government. demanding better jobs, and medical care for the poor. My sister warned me... That I was stepping on the wrong toes. That I was putting the family in danger, but I didn't listen. I felt that my cause was just... And that God... would protect me and my loved ones. [laughter] I'm sorry Miguel. You can't blame yourself for this, you didn’t perpetrate the crime. I might as well have pulled the trigger my self. This is nonsense! Your church, did they help? [laughs] They didn't do a damn thing. I knew if I stayed, I would die. So I left. Like a coward. In the middle of the night. Any more questions, priest? Is what Isabelle said true? You left me because you were afraid of me? [Jacob] No. It wasn't Isabelle talking. It was the demon, the demon can't be trusted. It's not all lies. Some of it is dead on. Claire I didn't say it was all lies, I said the demon can't be trusted. Then why did you leave me Jacob? This isn't the right time or the place, Claire. There's never a right time or place. I gotta get prepared for the next session It's a simple question, Jacob! Why did you leave? The demon was right about one thing. -I was afraid. -Of what? Afraid of hurting you. You know that I forgave you for that. Claire, I hit you, I beat you. [sighs] I've had my arm clear up to the shoulder up an angry horses hooch. I thought I'd pretty much seen everything life can throw at you. And now this stuff with Izzy man... I know. How long's Betsy gone now? It's been going on about two years now. Do you ever get lonely? Sure. That house gets awfully quiet, you know? I thought about going to one of those places, the Mustang ranch. Fella's got his needs, know what I'm saying? Well... That is what they're there for, right Doc? Just cause the cow dies, doesn't mean you gotta put the bull out to pasture. I guess. I couldn't imagine myself on those places. I would be in confession, for years after trying to talk myself out of that one. Well, where else is a man your age gonna find himself a nice woman, right Doc? There are plenty of fish in the ocean. Don't get me wrong. It just occurred to me? You've know my Blanche... Almost as long as I've known her. And you have gotten yourself a mighty fine woman there Eli. A fine woman. Just how fine would you say she is, Joe? She's very fine. I am not blind Joe. How long have you been cheating with my wife? I would never. Confession is going to be good for your soul. Now we better get it out on the table right here and right now. Hey you've got it all wrong. Blanche is a very attractive woman. -But I would never-- -That's bullshit. Now you get your ass up, Don't you say a goddamn word. You and I are gonna go for a little drive. Claire? Claire, if you can hear me... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I've always wanted to explain. I couldn't... It was painful. When I was a kid, my dad... he beat me around pretty good. I never told a soul. But I made a pact. I made a pact with my self. I swore that I would never become him... But after that night when I got drunk... I wasn't sure. So I ran. I bailed. I did it for you, Claire. That's when I found the priesthood. Please, forgive me. Turn it off. Don't kill me, Eli. It's very simple, Doc. You tell me the truth. What truth? The real truth or the truth you wanna hear? Because I didn't do it Eli! Confess it, and I will let you live. Don't fucking kill me. I slept with her, is that what you wanna hear? [laughs] You don't get it, do you? I sleep with her. You had sex with her. That's what you did, you had sex with my wife. I didn't. Man I didn't do it. [sighs] Well, old buddy... I think you're a filthy liar. [gunshot] Stop. You've got to be kidding me. I love you. I love you way too much. But this is wrong. I have tried everything to show you that I love you But no matter what I do, it's never enough. It's not you, it's me. How many more ridiculous clichés can you spout Jacob? Let's just be friends, how about that one? We're getting distracted. This demon is making us say and do things we wouldn't do. [breathing heavily] This is so humiliating. I've risked everything for you. You hit me Jacob, and I... Forgave you. Don't I deserve something for that? Yes, you do. But not now. I've got to get back. We've got to save your sister. Go save Isabelle from the devil. We'll talk about this later. No. Enough talking, I'm done talking. Claire I'm not going anywhere, I'm not running away. Get out! Just get out! [breathing heavily] [suspenseful music] Dear Joe, After Betsy’s passing, and the tragic death of your only child, it’s only normal that you would turn to another woman for comfort. Please don’t feel like you’ve betrayed Eli, by coming to me to talk. I’m glad I’ve been able to be here for you as a friend. Eli should be proud to have... A friend who is so honorable and loyal. Oh sweet god! [screaming] God, no! [gunshot] There he is. Back to rally the troops. Where is Eli? He took off in his truck. Hasn't come back. Maybe he went for help. More like rats jumpin’ off a sinkin’ ship, if you ask me. Deserters usually get shot in the back. Thought I was gonna have to plug you earlier, Padre. But I gotta hand it to you. You hung in there till the bitter end. We are not done yet. Come on we have work to do. Forget it. I'm done. He's right. It's over Jake. No, it's not over Luke. We're gonna see this thing through. To the end. Whatever that thing is that’s got a hold of Isabelle, it ain’t lettin’ go. We ain't got a snowball’s chance fightin’ it. That is not true. If we have faith-- Faith? You haven't got shit. You two cowards are going to help me save that girl, so help me God. -I'm not a coward. -Yes, you are. And until you go back in there and help me kick the crap out of that demon, you always be a coward. Back off, Padre. -I thought you loved Isabelle. -I do. [shouting] Well, prove it! You’re going to need relics. I threw almost everything away. But I kept these. My grandfather... gave them to me. She's gone. [groans in pain] [tension music gains momentum] [yelling] Isabelle! Isabelle! Luke! I adjure you, ancient spirit, by the judge of the living and the dead, by your Creator, of the whole universe. By him who has the power to consign you... To hell! Isabelle, who seeks refuge in the fold of God! To depart forthwith... In fear. Reveal yourself, demon! I'm not afraid of you. [screams] Yield not to my person but to the minister of Christ. For it is the power of Christ that compels you. The Holy Ghost commands you! [demon's voice] My name is Perloquus. [Jacob] Stay with her. Jacob! where are you going? [chants] I don't know what you're saying. When you came to the church... I didn’t think much of it, When you suddenly showed up, in the middle of the night... you'd been hiding, waiting for me to be drown in. You don't understand. I was desperate to help Isabelle. I thought black magic might help. You've been here the whole time, lingering, plotting, setting up your trap. I'm not a demon, you're insane! Perloquus! You wanted to control Isabelle the entire time. Depart, then, transgressor. Depart, seducer, full of evil. and cunning, foe of virtue. [shouting] Persecutor of the innocent. [smack] [growls] [hard punch] Hit me! Do it! Never! It's who you are, it's in your blood. [smack] It's not who I am. You spineless coward! Defend yourself! [breathing heavily] And now.... as I adjure you in his name, begone from this woman who is his creature. It is futile to resist his will. The longer you delay, the heavier your punishment shall be for it is not men you are condemning, but rather him, who rules the living and the dead, who shall come to judge the living and the dead, and the world by fire. Leave Perloquus. And may God bless yourself forever. Jesus. [demon's voice in the distance] What the hell are you doing? [sarcastic laugh] Why are you here? It's a long story. You're going to be Ok. [soft music]
