(gentle music) (soft music) (horse neighing) (tense music) (horse neighing) (gentle music) (soft music) - Come on, Jen. Come on. Open up. Come on swallow, darling. Good girl. Good girl. Try to sleep now, alright, sweetheart. There we are. - She any better? - Her fever's real high, Tom. She's gonna need some more of that prescription medicine. - It's expensive. - But you did sell that cord of wood. - Look, I didn't get it cut. You know I spent yesterday working over at Fletcher's. Still tryin' to get him to lend us his plow. - This is all that's left, Tom. Here's the list. Please, get the wood cut. - Well, if you hadn't sent the boy down to the river this morning, I'd have made him cut it. - We've been over this a hundred times. Tom, there's no sense wasting precious winter feed if the cattle can still graze in the pasture. - Well, driving the herd out to the hills when there's snow on the ground seems like a big waste of time to me. Six months in this god-forsaken territory and you figure you're running the operation. Know it all farmer just like your father. Get the horse hitched up. - [Chris] Pa. - What the hell have you done now? - I thought Nelson-- - You thought. Trouble is you never think. You are the damndest kid for forgetting or busting or losing. - Tom. (birds chirping) - Why don't you pay more attention to what you're doing. - Let's get the horse hitched on. Come on Nelson. - Nothing I say seems to make an impression around here anymore. (horse neighing) He doesn't seem to understand what it takes to run a place like this. - Well, neither did you when we first came out here. Christopher, you get ready for school. Tom, just pull it together. - No matter how much time we put into this place we never seem to get anything back. I'd like to sell this place and get out. - Please be patient with Christopher. He's still learning too. (gentle music) (lively music playing in saloon) - There we go, sir, I'll get your change. Thank you. Have you good day. - Pardon me. (raspy coughing) (dog barking) - Well, looky here, Arlo. Just when we was lookin' for a friendly face to buy us a drink (chuckling). - Sorry, fellas. - Isn't that cute, Orville. The little lady got him on such a tight string he can't buy us a whiskey. - Which lady, uh which lady you referring to? - Well, tell ya what. Why don't you buy us a drink, and you can tell us what lady we're talking about. - Yeah, and then we can tell ya about the time we were in Toledo. - Yeah. - Toledo. - Well, I think it was Toledo. Orville, was it in Toledo? - Yeah, somewhere in Colorado. - Well, there was this guy he had three horses and one little dog. ♪ She'll be driving six white horses ♪ ♪ She'll be driving six white horses ♪ ♪ She'll be driving six white horses ♪ ♪ When she comes ♪ (hysterical laughter) ♪ She'll get out the ole red dress when she comes ♪ ♪ She'll got out the ole red dress when she comes ♪ (hysterical laughter) - Chase, get these donkeys out of my way. - Well, I'll do just that if you give me a hand fellas. - Well, I'd love to, Chase, but you see I'm a little tied up right now. (hysterical laughter) (hysterical laughter) - He'd love to help you, Chase but his elbow's a little sore right now. - Besides he forgot his working gloves in the bar. - Frank, I'll give you a hand. (hysterical laughter) - [Arlo] Get 'em, Tom. - Come on, Tom, get 'em. Oh, yeah. Oh. That's it. - Tom. - Give me your hand. (tense music) (hysterical laughter) - In jungle lands so far away, these funny people live and play. They roam at will and rule supreme. They have crowned Ms. Hippo queen. (cartwheel squeaking) Three young men. Three young men they find. - Evening, Mrs. Fellows. - Good evening. - I'm afraid your husband's been in a fight. - Couldn't you just bring him home? - I wish there were some easier way to say this, ma'am. Tom is dead. - From a fight. - No, the fight was just a part of it. Tom, drowned in the river. The way I heard it was an accident. They'll be a hearing following the funeral you understand? Do you want me too sit with you a while? (coyote howling) (soft somber music) - Yeah, he was a little drunk, all right. He couldn't fight worth a lick. Chase, shoulda hit him just hard enough to stop him not knock him over the bank. - And how hard do you hit a man to stop him? - Well, I can sure demonstrate, Mr. Judge. Who do you want me to hit? (crowd chuckling) - And how hard did you hit 'em, Mr. Chase? - Well, I just tried to stop him. Like I said he slipped over the edge trying to get up. - Well, there's no question in my mind that Tom Fellows precipitated the fight that brought about his own death. Mr. Chase here has a certain moral responsibility for having struck him so hard. On the other hand, a man has the right to defend himself. So I move that this is simply a tragic accident that could've been avoided. Case dismissed. (people murmuring excitedly) - Mrs. Fellows, I'm awful sorry about what happened. If I'd a dreamed anything like this would've happened I'd a let Tom beat up on me or I'd a runaway. If there's anything I can do for you and the children. - Thank you, Mr. Chase. - What are you folks gonna do now? - Manage. (gentle music) (soft somber music) - We'll manage it, mama. Pa said you were gonna let him use your wagon, Mr. Fletcher. - I can't let you have it now kid. If I have time, I'll come over and help you out in a couple of weeks, okay. (soft somber music) (cows mooing) - Jenny. (gasping) Oh, no. Your father would've had this field marked by now. (soft music) (clock chiming) I'm trying to find a way to make $20 do the work of a 100. We both know that arithmetic hasn't been invented yet. - What if you sold the cattle and the ranch? - The way things are now it may not even make it through the winter. (soft somber music) I sit in here and try to figure things out. My mind keeps going around and round like a squirrel in a cage. Somehow when I come out here and look up at all this, everything seems to straighten itself out. - You figured out what we're gonna do yet, ma? - I haven't figured out all the details yet, but I can tell you one thing. We're not going back east with our hat in our hand. We're here now and we're staying. Yeah. (soft music) - Are we going to church, mama? - No dear. - Then where are we going? - Be quiet, children. I've got to think. (bright upbeat music) (cart wheels squeaking) (cow mooing) Come on, Jen. - Fellows. Mrs. Fellows. - May we come in? - [Frank] I've been meaning to get over to see ya. But I've been real busy. - You're a rancher, Mr. Chase. I understand how little time you have. Mr. Chase, the day of the hearing you said that if there was ever anything you could do to help us to let you know. - Well, all three of you didn't have to come. If you'd sent the boy, I would've have come right over. - That wouldn't have been enough I'm afraid. You see, I don't know how much longer we can go on at our place. We can grow things. We can even eat for a time, but-- - We're all caught in a bind for money, Mrs. Fellows. But you know how I feel about what happened. - I'm not asking for money, Mr. Chase. I'll be blunt. We need a man to work our farm, and even if Tom was at fault in that fight, you did take him away from us. - You want me to keep your cow while you go someplace? - I'd rather not go any place, Mr. Chase. I'd rather you keep the cow and us. - (chuckling) Whoa. Now back up a bit. All three of ya in this house. For the love of mike. Well, take a look around. It's one room. - Yes, I can see that, Mr. Chase. - Lady, your morals sure ain't what I thought they were. I always admired and respected you as a woman of high moral character. Now you breeze in here with that bald-faced proposition. If we did that the entire community would ride us both outta town. - No, they wouldn't Reverend Thomson would take care of that. - So that's it. Listen, lady, if I wanted me a wife, I would've got me one a long time ago. But I don't want one, and I certainly don't need one. - Oh, don't you, Mr. Chase. Just look at you. You're at the elbows and the knees. And just look at this place. I'll bet you live on pancakes, potatoes, and beans. If you accept my offer, you'll eat a lot better, and I'd still save you money. - With two kids. - Two children, a good horse and buggy, two dozen laying heavens and 10 head of cattle including the milk cow. Add a lean-to against that far wall, and you can have your bedroom at one end of the cabin and the children and I can be at the other. - Now just a minute. First, you start talkin' about Reverend Thomson. Now you're talking about splittin' my house down the middle. Lady, you don't make any sense. - Mr. Chase, I'm not looking for a husband anymore than you are looking for a wife. What I am proposing is a marriage in name only. What you'll get is three hot cooked meals a day. Your clothes washes and pressed and a house that's always spic and span. - And all this for taking on three people and having my house torn up. - In a month you'll wonder how you ever got along without us. - Lady, you got the nerve of a bull moose. Just take your kids and head back where ya came from. - Come along children. Obviously, Mr. Chase, is not the kind of man who meant what he said that day in town. - Mrs. Fellows. Reverend Thomson will never agree to it. - The ring, Mr. Chase. - Well, all that's left is the cattle. - All that's left. (soft music) Christopher. Don't forget my name is Mrs. Sarah Chase now not Fellows. - Is our name Chase too? - No, you're still Christopher and Jenny Fellows. - You mean you're not our mother anymore. - Of course, I am sweetheart. It just means that Mr. Chase is your stepfather now. It's gonna take him some time to get used to us, so I want you both to mind him, you hear. If there's any trouble, I'll stand up for ya. (cows mooing) - Well, what do we call him, mama? - Why Mr. Chase, of course. (gentle music) (soft dramatic music) (coyote howling) - You're gonna have to take a bath before you go in the house, you know. - Is that so, how come? - 'Cause Chris told ma you smell like the barn. (chickens clucking) (soft chuckling) - Why don't you go in the house and see if your ma's got lunch ready, ya. Go on. With all these women folk around I guess I'm gonna have to make sure I wash behind my ears more often. - Lunch is ready. - Comin' in for lunch? - I'm not hungry. - I thought it'd be easier if you had your own separate area. Oh, please. - What's this, Frank? - That's the hammer. - Jenny, please don't bother, Mr. Chase. - You don't mind, do you, Frank? - She's not bothering me. You know, I don't think we should include the kids in this formal set up you've devised. - Well, I should think that you would understand the need for it, Mr. Chase. - Well, I don't. Spell it out to me, Sarah. - And there's no need for you to call me Sarah at home. - Why I think that's where it's most necessary. Of course, I'm not a very good hypocrite. - Meaning I am. - Not at all. We were talkin' about me. (gentle music) (horse neighing) (soft upbeat music) (tense music) (horse neighing) What happened, boy? Did you have a runaway? You should've been finished a while ago. I figured something must be wrong. Well, everything looks all right. What happened? Something spook the horses? Well, say somethin', boy. - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - I wasn't there when they ran away. - Well, you were darn lucky. You could've been hurt bad. Where were you? - I left them so I could climb the ridge. - Well, what the heck for? That's a barren ridge. - I climbed it to see a horse. - A horse. Well, maybe you can still finish tomorrow if we get the blacksmith workin' on it first thing. - You still trust me with the team? - Heck, you think you're the only one that ever pulled a dumb trick? (horse neighing) (man yelling faintly) - Oh, let's go (grunting). Come on, come on. - Will ya. - Come on. - That's the one. - Outlaw like that ain't much good on a cattle ranch. Well, your ma's gonna wonder where we are. - I know. - Well, let's get this wheel out of the way. (gentle music) When I was a kid, I always wanted to have a thousand head of cattle roaming my own land. Your ma would call that a practical goal. Well, I'm still workin' on that one. To date, countin' your ma's stock, I'd say I'm about 961 short. She's a clever lady, your ma. She's quite a woman. Here, boy, you take this list of supplies over to the General Store, and I'll pick you up when Hank's finished. - Okay. - Good day, I have your package for you. There we are. Thank you, bye, bye. (door slamming closed) - Here you are. - Thank you, ladies. Would you like to put that in your bag? Thank you. - Mr. Chase, will be in to pay for this in a few minutes. - Thanks. Anything I can do for you, boys? Baking powder and summer sausage. - Everything in order, Mr. Adamson? - Yes, everything's fine. - [Frank] You'll put these on my account? - I sure will. - You bring the rest, boy. - Well, well. Big man comes to town. Think he can lick me, Orville a man who can stand on his own two feet and fight back? - Nah. - Alright, Orville, you've had your fun. - Not quite we ain't. - You've had this comin' for months. And this is for Tom. - [Chris] Stop. - [Adamson] I don't want any trouble in here. - Leave him alone. Get off of him. (glass breaking) - I've been waitin' for this moment for a long time. These two boys are gonna pay for this right down to the last bean. - [Arlo] Orville. - [Orville] You're so stupid. - [Sheriff] Shut up. (soft gentle music) - You ever had a black eye? - Well, that's a little better, but not a whole lot. 'Fraid that's the best I can do. - You don't look too good neither, Mr. Chase. - I'll tell ya if you hadn't walloped Arlo, I'd look a whole lot worse. That's a pretty nervy thing for a boy to do. You mind being called Chris? Your ma always says Christopher. - I like Chris better, better than boy. - Good, I don't much like Mr. Chase neither. Frank suits me just fine. Come on. - Golly, Chris, does it hurt? - A little. - I'd like to know when these shenanigans are going to stop. - Boy, Chris had Orville laid out cold with that ax handle. - Frank really flattened Arlo. I'll bet he eats soup all winter. - I wish the cattle could eat soup all winter. You've got 15 calves eating hay this winter as well as the horses. It's Chris and Frank now, is it? Uh-huh. - What are you so darn anxious about? We got plenty of feed ow. We could feed more stock if we had it. - We can. I just wanted to make sure. (soft upbeat music) - [Chris] What are you all dressed up for? You told Frank we were going to our place. - Well, I changed my mind. (people cheering) (horse neighing) (people yelping) (horse neighing) Mr. Fletcher, I'm not talking about unimproved ranch land. I'm talking about exceptionally good valley bottom land. - Well, I've got along very well without it so far, Mrs. Chase. - You've been lucky so far. But we're in for a particularly bitter winter I hear, and your herd's larger now than it's ever been. If you lose half your stock because of lack of feed, well, you'd be little better off than the rest of us. - Well, I'll tell you what. I'll take your place provided we can arrive at a reasonable praise. - $4 an acre, plus the last cutting of hay. - Mrs. Chase, I said reasonable. - Well, Mr. Fletcher, I'm in no hurry. I can wait till spring. I plan on advertising in several eastern papers. - You're mistaken if you think you can sell your land that way. - And you're mistaken if you think that I can't. You see I'm from the east, and I know that every day the papers are full of ads for land out here. - Mrs. Chase, I'll pay you $2.50 an acre right now. That's $750 cash on the barrel. - Mr. Fletcher, that doesn't even account for the land improvements we've made. I can get $4 advertising in the east. - Lady, I'll pay you $3 out of the goodness of my heart and because you're a woman. - That's very kind. But it's the value of my land we're discussing not me. - Very well then you heard me, $3. - Mr. Fletcher, if you lose 500 head of cattle in a blizzard for lack of feed, you'd be lucky to get away with a loss of only a couple of thousand dollars. You just calculate the value of what my land will yield, and with the feed you get you'd be getting my place for nothing several times over. - Alright, all right. 3:25 including the last cutting of hay and that's my final offer, you take it or leave it. - Sold. (men yelping) (horse neighing) - [Fletcher] There we go. - Thank you. - [Ranch Hand] Watch out, watch out. Over there, over there, watch out. (men yelping) (horse neighing) - An outlaw like that should be shot, Mr. Fletcher. (soft gentle music) (cows mooing) - Sarah, for the love of mike what's going on? - Remember my saying the Hamilton's had to give up their ranch? - You said they were havin' trouble. - Well, they were gonna have a sale next week. So, this afternoon I bought all their cattle for $20 a head. Seeing as how I sold my ranch to Sam Fletcher for 975. - Sold it. To Fletcher. - [Sarah] You approve though? - Yeah, absolutely. It is impractical to try and run two spreads. - And now you're only 941 head short, Frank. (soft music) - What does he mean? - The first time I seen this land I knew it was what I'd been lookin' for my whole life. I could see it all in hay and grain and a thousand head of my own stock roamin' the open range. Now I'm only 941 head short. But tare comin' by golly. They're comin'. The boy and his dream. - As Christopher says, "You are only 941 head short." - You know that first day that you said, in a month or so I'd wonder how I ever got along without ya. You were right. This is a fine thing you've done, Sarah. - It was the practical thing to do, Mr. Chase. - Hey, ma, come here. (horse neighing) - He sure is black. - What is this animal doing here? - Some kinda day for surprises, ain't it? Fletcher was gonna shoot him. - I saw this creature almost kill a man this morning. - I've been watchin' him run with Fletcher's herd all fall, mom. He's really a wonderful pony. - Yes, for bucking and injuring people. What on Earth ever possessed you to bring him home. It's, it's. - Impractical. - Exactly. Here we are struggling from hand to mouth to make ends meat, and you go and pick up some wild, useless outlaw no one else would have as a gift. - I figure sometimes even a kid should have somethin' he dreams about. - Well, Sam Fletcher certainly got the last word today. We'll be the laughing stock of the community. - I couldn't let him shoot it. - It was his horse he had every right to do with it exactly what he wanted. - Well, I don't care. I bought the horse for Chris. - Well, then obviously he's your problem young man, so you'd better find something else for it to do around here besides eating precious winter feed and taking up space in the barn. - I never seen her that angry before. (horse neighing) We got our work cut out gentling this one. - How do we start? - I'm no exert. This fella's been hog tied, beaten up and no tellin' what else. Let him get used to seeing ya. Try talkin' to him. (horse neighing) - Frank, I'm glad you didn't let him shoot him. - Thank you, Lord, for the food we are about to receive, amen. - Amen. Chris, isn't eating anything tonight, is he, mama.? - That's right. What we save on his dinner can go to that horse of his. - I'm not gonna hurt you. You've gotta understand that. (barn door screaking) Frank told me I should talk to him. I talked and talked. He's still afraid of me. Have you tried feeding him alfalfa? - Alfalfa, oats, milk, sugar nothing works. - Have you tried these? (gentle music) - It's all right. (horse neighing) Easy boy. Be still. Be still. (horse neighing) Easy boy. (horse neighing) - Get them 'round the stumbling post see. Come on. That's it, that's it. Get them 'round the stumbling post now. That's it, Chris. That's it. See he'd get used to that saddle now. See, that's it. Keep it around the post don't let go now. Come on. Hold on to him. (horse neighing) - Be good, boy. (horse neighing) - How are you gonna run a ranch with a broken shoulder? - Maybe this outlaw can't be ridden. - He just needs a little more time, Frank. - There's one trick my father used to use. He always said a horse had a one track mind. Why don't you try putting this in his ear. - A rock. - If you time it right, he'll be distracted long enough so you could mount him and get his head back before he can buck. - That sounds far-fetched to me. - Worked for father. - Try it, Frank. (horse squealing) - Stand back. (gentle music) Open the gate for the love of mike. (gentle music) I think we got the makins' of a real good work horse here, son. - I'm still not convinced. (horse neighing) (soft music) (horse neighing) (chickens clucking) (loud crash) - I told you, you weren't ready to ride. Come on I'll take ya. (chickens clucking) (cows mooing) - Put him on my bed. You could've been killed. - I'll say. Your face is a mess. - Jenny, get the towels. Did you think that you could break this outlaw to ride? Did you? - He seemed so tame. - There. - Nothin' to worry about it's only a sprain. It needs to be bandaged though. (horse neighing) - What are you gonna do, ma? - The horse isn't ready. Chris was just trying to prove something. - Maybe you can get on this outlaw's back and ride him if that's what you call it. But I will not have our farm in an uproar nor my son maimed for life. You're as much to blame asked pony is for him gettin' hurt. Now I'm gonna break this damn horse if it's the last thing I do. But I'm gonna do it in my own way and in my own good time. - If this animal isn't broken by the end of the month, I'm gonna shot it myself. (horse neighing) - Frank told me I shouldn't ride him. I just wanted to prove to you how good he was. - I know. That's just what I've been afraid of all long. Remember you're the man of the family now. - You've got Frank too, mama. But he likes you. - Goodnight, sweetheart. Get a goodnights sleep now. (clock chiming) (gentle music) (horse neighing) (birds squawking) (bird squawking) (soft music) (cows mooing) (thunder roaring) (thunder roaring) (Christopher mumbling softly) - It's gettin' worse, isn't it mama? - Uh-huh. - Frank will know what to do. - Oh, I'm not worried. Of course, he will. - I hid the gun under the mattress, but don't tell mama, shh. - I'm going to make sure the corral gate is open, ma. (gate hinges squeaking) (barn door squeaking) - Come on now let's go home. Let's go home come on now. (cow mooing) Come on now we're almost there. (horse neighing) (dramatic music) We're almost there. (horse neighing) (horse neighing) (tense dramatic music) (horse neighing) - Let me see, boy. You got yourself snagged, eh. I'll get you lose. (horse neighing) (upbeat music) (gentle dramatic music) (tense music) What's wrong with him? - I should've come out and checked him during the night. Go on up to the house and get some blankets. - We need blankets right away, ma. The pony's sick. - All the blankets are on the bed, Christopher, and I don't want them in the barn. - He can have mine. (somber music) - Frosted lungs ain't necessarily fatal, but I'm no veterinarian. Just gonna have to do everything we can. I can't promise anything. (gentle music) - Please eat. Please. You've got to. You'll die. - Don't, Christopher. We'll get you another horse. - You hated him from the beginning. You weren't even willing to give him a chance. Well, he saved my life last night, and I'm gonna try to save his whether you like it or not. - I didn't mean it the way it sounded I'm sorry. - You're not sorry for anything you say. You make up your mind and you never change it. - Chris. Let's get another blanket on him, uh. We'll sweat it out of him. - Christopher. I'd like to help. - Well, if you've got any ideas, we could sure use 'em. - Well, what if we treated him the way you would a human being with pneumonia. Fill up all our pails and kettles with water and put them on the stove. Christopher, you go up to the house and you bring back the big washtub and the flour sack and the big bag of mustard. (coyote howling) This area here needs a lot of heat. Christopher. I think we can leave this on for a couple of hours. He's got to eat though he's awfully weak. Come on, boy. Come on, boy, just try it. Come on this is good, come on. At least the mustard's making him warm. All we can do now is wait. (soft somber music) Is Jenny asleep? Good, open the barn doors a little. The fresh air will do him good. He's feeling pretty warm. His eyes look a little clearer. I wonder. - Uh, that could be a reflex action. Maybe. Christopher, you take the mane. Frank, you take the tail. We've gotta get him on his feet or else or else he's never gonna make it. Come on, fella, come on. Come on just give. Come on boy. A little more one more time there that's. (loud grunt) - It's no use, Sarah. He's no better off than when we found him this morning. (soft pensive music) - We're gonna need some whiskey. Christopher, you get some fresh gunny stacks. I'm gonna go up to the house, and I'm gonna brew us a pot of really strong coffee. - Coffee? (gentle dramatic music) - Whiskey. That should do it. Now let's just get that bottle right up here. Come on, come, that's it. Hey, enough there. Let's leave him be. We'll try again in a little while. - Sarah. Why don't you get some sleep, uh? Chris and me can handle it. (rooster squawking) - Come on. Come on. Come on now. Frank. Frank. Frank, help me get him up. (whip cracking) - Stop it, ma. - Quickly, Christopher, help with his head. Come on get on your feet. Get. Up. - Okay, get the lariat. Get the lariat. (tense dramatic music) - Christopher. - Hold on to that boy. - Get up. - Come on up. Up. - Come on. There he is. - He's up. (upbeat gentle music) - Why don't you try leading him around a little. - He's gonna be alright now, isn't he ma? - Oh, it'll be a couple of weeks before he's himself again. But he's gonna be just fine. - Can I interest you in a hot breakfast? (soft music) (gentle upbeat music) (soft music)
