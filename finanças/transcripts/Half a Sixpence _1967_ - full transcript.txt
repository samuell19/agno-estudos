- Tie. - No, I won. But you don't run bad for a girl. Hey, look. - Here, a new sixpence. - I saw it first. It's mine. I want to keep it. How can you? You're only a girl. No pockets. I'd like to go for a row, Artie. I can't. I'll be late, and old Woodrow will kill me. Come on, Artie. It would be gorgeous. Kipps, come up here, you little beggar. Now I'm in for it. Cor, I'm gonna get a hiding. Come on. Come on. Come on. Now, then. Fine start you've made, late on your first day. Just like you, you scruffy little waif. Blessing for me that after today you'll belong to Mr Edwin Shalford. Now, you others. Back indoors, back indoors. Go on, go on. Well, off you go, Kipps. Pick up your things. - Goodbye, Ann. I'll write. - I'll write too, Artie. Every day. - I'll miss you, Artie. - I'll miss you, Ann. Never forget you. Ann, I have something very important to tell you. Come on, boy. Hurry up. We can't wait all day. Sit down, boy. We've got a long ride. - Take care of our sixpence. - I will. Don't forget to write, Artie. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Shalfords Emporium. Your home for the next seven years, boy. - Cor, it's big. - Get a move on. Thanks for the ride. And you watch your step with that Mr Shalford. From what I hear, he eats little boys like you alive. I'm not frightened. Kipps! My heart and liver, I've never seen such a boy. I'm gonna work you till your feet wear out. - I mean to get value for me charity. - Yes, sir. System. Efficiency. Economy! Go on. Get a move on. Morning, Edwin. Morning. Come on. Wake up. Oi! Some people aren't pulling their weight here, and you're one of them. You caught no mice again, have you? You know our trouble, Edwin? We're a couple of scruffy orphans with no use to anyone but old Shalford. - Morning, Sid. - Morning. Good morning, Bugs. - What's good about it? - Nothing's good about it. And it's all the fault of capitalism. Charlie Marx has got the right idea. - A lot of good he is in Russia. - Well, what about Glasgow? The workers struck in Glasgow, and they got an extra fourpence a day. Yes, but they haven't got a Shalford in Glasgow. They're lucky. - Morning, Pearce. - Morning, Kipps. - Hey. - Yeah? - Come here. - What? - I had a smashing dream last night. - Yeah? I danced all night with a lovely chorus girl. - And all she was wearing... - Shut up. You have the same dream every night. Never gets you nowhere. - Where do your dreams get you? - Nowhere now. But come the revolution... I can't wait that long. We're in a blessed drainpipe, and we're gonna crawl along it till we die. You'll find us blokes everywhere. All drapers, us, in 20 years' time. Trumps. Beggars. Lavatory attendants. Yeah, no savings, no pensions, nothing. They got us just where they want us. Look, there it is, mate, in three words. - Efficiency. - System. - Economy. - Tea. - Tea? - Remember the rules, Kipps. There will be no making of tea or any other beverages, except at specified times. - Penalty for disobeying this rule? - One penny! Under no circumstances will gas be used for meals or lighting after 9:00 at night. - Fine for disregarding this rule? - Threepence! - Fine for disobeying any or all fines? - Fourpence! - If I have to look at those rules one... - And remember at all times: Economy Our wage each week ls a long time coming All in the cause of economy The gas pipes leak And there ain't no plumbing All in the cause of economy There's hundreds of rules We must all obey But each time we break one It makes his day Because it gives him a chance To dock our pay All in the cause of economy He gives us tea But it's halved and quartered All in the cause of economy The beer is free But the beer is watered All in the cause of economy At mealtime we sit down And say our prayer We pray for some steak That is nice and rare Because the steak is so rare It's rarely there All in the cause of economy Shalford has a way Of saving money on his old emporium All in the cause of economy We've earned a raise But we don't get any All in the cause of economy In winter we perish To save his coal And even on Sunday He takes his toll When he sends us to church To save his soul Efficiency! Economy! Efficiency! Economy! Efficiency! Economy! Efficiency, economy, system! - He buys things low - And he ups the prices All in the cause of economy He's pure as snow Because he's got no vices All in the cause of economy And as for his missus From what one hears She sits all alone there In floods of tears Because she ain't had a kiss In 40 years All in the cause All in the cause All in the cause of economy All right, all right. - Morning. - Morning. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. Who's that from? As if we didn't know. - Does she ever run out of ink? - Never lets me down. - Morning, Flo. - Morning, ugly. Morning, girls. - How's it going, Vicky? - Leave off, saucy. - How are you feeling, cheerful? - Awful. I didn't sleep a wink. - Dreaming of me? - Indigestion. - Here he comes! - Here he comes! Good morning, Mr Shalford. Too many curls. Takes the customers' minds off the merchandise. Lace your stays tighter. None of that socialist muck in my emporium. You reek of eau de cologne. - Kipps? - Mr Shalford? - What's the golden rule? - Efficiency, sir. - And what then? - Efficiency, system, economy, sir. And don't you forget it. - Particularly economy. - Oh, no, sir. I won't, sir. - Fat chance I'll get. - Carshott. Take your spectacles off your forehead and keep your eyes on my books. Yes, sir. Now. - Oh, I say! - What is it? It's Ann! She's here! - I thought she was in London. - So she was, but look. The lady she works for has moved here, and Ann's moved with her. - She wants me to meet her tonight. - Fancy! - What time, then? - Seven o'clock. - Seven o'clock. That's now. - Yeah. I got an appointment. - Get ready! - You ought to wash your neck. - Here's a penny. - Give us your arm. How are you gonna recognize her? On the promenade, lamppost number six. I'll recognize her anywhere. - I think. - What if she's changed? - I mean, gone to fat. - Or got spots? I should go careful if I were you. I don't care. I'll see her anyway. Well, go on then. - Well, go on then! - Good luck. - Be brave. - I'll lock up. Artie? Artie? Ann'? Yeah. - You've grown up very nice. - Have I? Yeah, you have too. Well, you... You're tall. Well, taller than me, anyway. Thanks for writing. - I got all your letters. - I got yours too. I kept them. Read them over and over. I keep them locked away. Artie... Artie, who's Flo? The one you're always writing about. - Sundays on the beach and that? - Do I? Oh, she's nothing. What I mean is, she's...Sid's girl. - It's all right then. - Were you jealous? I mean... ...there's no one else. There never has been. Guess the lady's weight, sir? Halfpenny if I do. If I don't, soot-free. - Shall I? - Go on, then. - Excuse me, Mister. - Oh, no offense, sir. I'm only calculating. I should say the little lady is a trim 7 stone 12. That's what I should say. UP you go, dear. Joe Harper's never wrong. You're very good. Wow. Uncanny, that's what that is. - Thank you. - Thank you, Miss. He didn't have to be so familiar. Oh, Artie, he was only calculating. He didn't mean any harm. - He didn't... - Well, don't let's argue about it. Well, say, Ann? Yeah? Will you be my girl? I wouldn't mind. All right then. You are. What happens now? Well, we ought to make it regular. Do it proper. - What do you mean? - Well, exchange tokens or something. What's "tokens"? Look. Oh, Artie. - Is that our sixpence? - I had the blacksmith rip it apart. I don't know what for. You keep half, I keep half. When we're separated... - Where are you going? - Nowhere. If we're ever apart, you look at your half, and I look at mine... ...and we think of each other. That's nice. Ann. Can I kiss you? Kissing's soft. Artie, where did you find out about these tokens? I read in the Sunday papers What lovers' tokens are There's amulets and there's talismans Like a ring or a lucky star It says that half a sovereign ls a thing they use a lot But sixpence is The only thing I've got Still, half a sixpence ls better than half a penny ls better than half a farthing ls better than none It's a token of Our eternal love When you're far away Touch it every day And though that half a sixpence Can only mean half a romance Remember that half a romance ls better than none But when I'm with you One and one make two And likewise two half sixpences Joined together make one Artie, a lovely idea. Half a sixpence ls better than half a... - Shilling? - No. - Is better than half a... - Penny. Is better than none - It's a token of - It's a token of - Our eternal love - Our eternal love - When you're far away - When you're far away Touch it every day - And though that half a sixpence - Yeah? Can only mean half a romance - Remember that half a romance - Well? Is better than none And likewise two half sixpences Joined together make A token of Eternal love When you're far away Touch it every day And though that half a sixpence Can only mean half a romance Remember that half a romance ls better than none But when I'm with you One and one make two And likewise two half sixpences Joined together make Joined together make Two half sixpences Joined together make one Getting warmer, Mrs Walsingham. I've some fine new summer materials coming down from London. Now, I hope you'll get dotted swiss. Mother looks ripping in dotted swiss. I'm afraid my dear boy is a little prejudiced. Oh, by the way, Hubert, did you tell Mr Shalford about the new project at the town hall? Yes, the Young Working Person's Association, to keep young people off the streets. We've started courses in woodwork and pottery, that sort of thing. - Very useful. - Indeed, it is. My daughter, Helen, is already teaching a class. Maybe some of your apprentices would volunteer. I'm sure they would. You see? Young Kipps has just volunteered. Splendid. - Very well, then. Eight o'clock. - He'll be there. Good day, Shalford. Very wise of you to volunteer for Mrs Walsingham's woodworking class tonight. Me, sir? How'd I do that, sir? You signaled me from the window. Sound business sense, that. Mrs Walsingham's one of our best customers. She has an account. - I can't, sir. I've got an appointment. - Cancel it. - We got no rules about woodworking. - You have now. Eight o'clock, the town hall. Sharp. - Night, Artie. - Night. Night, Artie. Won't forget to lock up, will you? - Good. - Good night, Artie. You're seeing your girl tonight, aren't you? Yeah, I was. But after this I gotta go woodworking. - Go what? - Woodworking. Old Shalford volunteered me. If you see her, she's at the sixth lamppost on the promenade. She's a little thing. Very pretty. - All right. - No spots. Lucky beggars. Come on, Edwin. At least someone's going out tonight. Go on! And don't be late! Oh, out of control! - Am I in time to buy knickerbockers? - We're shut. You aren't hurt, are you, matey? You did give me a bit of a onner in the back. Those handles, they're too low. And when I turn, if I don't remember... I'm into something. I was coming down the hill at a whop. Backpedaling for all I'm worth. Not that I'm worth much. - Yes, well, cycling knickerbockers... - Oh, blow knickerbockers. It's time I did something about you. You took that biff like a gent. The name is Chitterlow. "Harry" to you. "Harry" to everybody. From Lily Langtry to Sir Henry. - Sir Henry? - Sir Henry Irving. The great actor/manager, old H.l. Everyone knows me. I'm an actor, you see. - And a playwright. - Really? Not that I've had any done, but you wait. One's coming that will make your hair stand up. Pleased to meet you. I've never met an actor. Or a playwright. Come to think of it, I've never even seen a play. My dear chap. Have you never even seen The Second Mrs Tanqueray? I haven't seen the first. And what about the last act of The Lyon's Mail? Nabbed! Nabbed at last. But they shan't take me cheap. Have you seen Sir Henry in The Bells? The bells, the bells. - I hear nothing. - What? 'Tis but a jangling in my ears. I have him now. I have him! The bells, the bells. He comes. He... He comes. I have him now. Here, where are you going? To the lime kiln. Well, you can't just take that... - Look, look. - Where, where? Those eyes. Those eyes! How he glares at me. That's the dream scene. What says the clock? The theater calls. You come with me, and I'll treat you to a noggin of the old Methuselah. I say, your costume is rather awry. Never mind, we'll settle it in a jiff. - Where are we going? - Leave that to Captain Chitterlow. - Don't worry, it's all downhill. - To the sea? It depends on the bicycle. I'm heading for the theater. Beg your pardon. There. That looked like Artie. It was Artie. Here we are. Come on, me lad. We'll have those pants fixed in a jiffy. This way. Sorry. Come on. Where did I put that old Methuselah? That's Laura Livermore. Best soubrette in the business. Wonderful figure of a woman. With her stays on. - You're not a teetotaler, are you? - Don't know, I never tried. Then you're in for a great treat, my boy. Wonderful stuff. Brings tears to your eyes. Laura, bring some needle and thread, will you? - What color? - Mr Shalford calls it... ...clerical gray. - Say, she's a bit hot. - Only on the surface. Beneath breathes the soul of a milkmaid. Well, show us the damage then. Yes, show us the damage. Stretch across me lap, and I'll mend you in a jiffy. Lay on MacDuff, she won't bite you. She only nips. Too big for your britches? Laura, I want you to meet my young friend... Kipps. Arthur Kipps. Arthur Kipps. K-I-P-P-S? - Yeah. - Well, blow me down. That's the thickest coincidence I've ever struck. This very afternoon I put you in a play. I went down the column and took every name that fit. I don't believe in made-up names. Here we are. "If Arthur Kipps, son of Margaret Euphemia Kipps, - "born September the 1st, 1880..." - Hey, that's me! - That's me too. - Hold still, darling. Couldn't be two Kipps with a mother named Margaret Euphemia. "If Arthur Kipps will communicate with Messrs Watson and Bean, "he may learn something to his advantage." I don't understand. What does it mean? I think you're going to strike it rich. If so, where does Harry come in? Maybe you'd like a half interest in Harry's new play. - Yeah, but if you was me... - If I was you, I'd celebrate. - Already? - No time like the present. - To Arthur Kipps, millionaire. - I'll drink to that. You'd drink to anything. Come on, me boy. Hello, what are you doing here? We saw you riding like the cops were after you. - May I present Miss Laura Livermore. - How do you do? - Your pal's had a bit of luck. - So we heard. - This is Mr Harry Chitterlow. - How do you do? Fellow thespians, lend me your ears. I want you to meet a young millionaire. This lucky lad has just inherited a great fortune. - What you gonna do with it? - Haven't got it yet. But when you've got it, in your pocket, burning a hole, - what are you going to buy? - A yacht? A mansion? A motorcar? - Me? - Thank you very much. What then? - If I had the money in my pocket? - Yes. - I'd buy something I've always wanted. - And what is that? - I'd buy a banjo. - A banjo? If I had money to burn A hole in my pocket If I had money to burn I'd go like a rocket Down to the town without a stop Blow right into the music shop And buy me a banjo Buy me a banjo Buy me a banjo That's what I would do If I had all that money could buy If you had all that money could buy If you had all that money could buy What would you do? I'd buy me a banjo Play on the banjo Night and day on the banjo - That's what! would do - Hey Hello! - If you had money to burn - I'd burn a hole in my pocket - If you had money to burn - I'd go like a rocket Down to the town without a stop Blow right into the music shop And buy the banjo Buy the banjo Buy the banjo That's what! would do A tiara Of diamonds and pearls. Or an earl Banjo, a banjo, I must have a banjo Find me a banjo Find the boy a banjo - Get the boy a banjo - I gotta get a banjo I gotta get a banjo Banjo, banjo, got to get together Got to get the boy a banjo - Banjo - Banjo Cease! A banjo. I'll buy me a banjo Play on the banjo Night and day on the banjo That's what! would do Come on. I'd buy me a banjo Play on the banjo Night and day on the banjo That's what! would do I'd go like a rocket Burn a hole in my pocket I'd be in a hurry Never, never worry If I had all that money could buy If I had all that money could buy If I had all that money could buy I'd buy me a banjo Play on the banjo Go, the banjo Night and day on the banjo That's What! would do You'll have a lovely hangover. Look at him. Too much of the old Methuselah, Artie? - Look out, here comes Shalford. - Get out of here. Quick, go, run. My ship came in. Kipps, what are you doing up there? Those eyes, how they glare at me! One of your apprentices? I do believe he's been drinking. An apprentice from my emporium? Never. He's looking for the cat. An apprentice from my emporium? Never. He's looking for the cat. Send him to the woodworking class, Mr Shalford. - Good night, sir. - I'll march him to the class myself. Kipps, come down. Come down. Come down. Come here. Come here. Come here. Gotcha. You're a disgrace to my emporium. Go on...to woodwork. - What are you making, Mr Jones? - I don't know, Miss Walsingham. - It looks like a pipe rack. - Does it? I'm certain it's a pipe rack. And an excellent example to us all. A combination of the useful and the beautiful. All right, back to work now. - I'm afraid you're a bit late, Mr... - Kipps. Arthur Kipps. I'm very sorry, Miss, but I was unavoidably detained. I see. Is it raining? I've been in a horse trough. Now then, Mr Kipps. What handicraft have you decided to practice? - What, what? - Mr Jones is making a pipe rack. - I don't smoke. - There must be something you need. - Something practical for the home. - I haven't got a home, Miss. - Poor boy, where do you live? - In Mr Shalford's cellar. There must be something that would come in useful down there. A mousetrap. Could you not think of something...more aesthetic? - Please, Miss. - You've thought of something. Can I leave the room? I don't feel well. Old Methuselah. - Some fresh air. - As you wish. Perhaps we could open the door. I'll do it. It's no trouble. - What's going on, then? - I cut my hand. - What's happened? - We must bandage it at once. - Your handkerchief? - Haven't got a cold. - Never mind, I have one. - Cor. Hold it quite steady now. - We're not hurting you, are we? - Not a bit. Put your finger on the knot, dear. The knot. - There. - Loosen it when you get home, - or gangrene may set in. - Then you'll have your arm sawn off. That will be all for tonight. We'll meet again next week. - Good night, Miss Walsingham. - Good night. Good night. - Good night, Mr... - Kipps. Arthur Kipps. Thank you very much for the handkerchief. Lucky devil, she called you "dear". I've been here three months and she's never called me "dear". - But I never cut me wrist. - I suppose today's my lucky day. - Look at him. - Hey... ...that old Methuselah was really potent. Hang on. - Oh, yeah. - After you. Hey, Art, you slept right through church. - Oh, no. - Yes, a great shame. The vicar went on about the evils of drink. Get up. It was worth a whoop up. - Did you find Ann last night? - How? We were in the theater with you. - I hope she's not still waiting. - See you there, all right? We said we'd see the girls at the beach. Coming? - Do you good. - I hope the tide's in. - It's too cold to go swimming. - Shut up. He had a bellyful last night, didn't he? Come along. Now, watch out for the bus. Come on, Kate. Come on, girl. Too cold to go swimming? - You're Buggins. - That's right. How did you know? - What? - You must be Sid. I ain't seen her before. - Hello, darling. - Pearce. Who's she? What's all this about, then? - You're Flo. - No, I'm Flo. - You must be Ann, the letter writer. - That's me. That's right. I had a message for you last night from Artie. Where is he? - Where is he? - He'll be here in half an hour. - Yeah, he overslept, see. - He was tired. - Why was he tired? - Who? - Artie. - Come with us. We'll tell you what we heard. We think the boys were covering for him. Such a hangover this morning. A real Whopper. Do you know what? That actress who sewed up his bottom has been married three times. - She's looking for a fourth husband. - I don't believe a word of it. A single blinking word of it. Who ever, ever heard of it? A boy like him if you'd like to know whatl think I'll tell you not half - Well, tell us - You're jealous - Of Artie? That's a laugh - It ain't a funny joke at all A funny, blooming joke at all He ain't that kind of bloke at all Just use your eyes It's all a pack of blinking, ruddy lies - Lies - Lies I'd like to know just what You're driving at When a boy gets whiskers On his chin He will soon start falling into sin For he'll meet those irresistible forces Horses Women And gin When he's tasted pleasure Once or twice He will surely have to pay the price And nothing undermines His character quicker Than liquor Ladies And vice He wouldn't do that to me Why, it's perfectly plain to see Philandering ain't ever The kind of thing he'd do He gave me half a sixpence To prove his love was true - Half a sixpence? - I'm sure in my heart that he Wouldn't do that to me He's already done it, you silly girl. I don't believe a word of it A single blinking word of it Who ever, ever heard of it? It's not like him Why, he couldn't be unfaithful Not ever to me - He's lying - You're prying - Just you wait and see - Last night he made a night of it - He hit the whiskey quite a bit - Whiskey? He hates the blooming sight of it. It's just absurd I don't believe a single, ruddy Rotten, blooming, blinking... - Ann! - Word. - Hello, love. You look very... - Shut up. Listen, I've got a lot to tell you. A fellow came in on a bicycle...

I enjoyed the promenade You were somewhere drinking hard - And having fun with Flora - Actually, her name was Laura. - Laura? - She sewed me trousers. Look. - I don't want to know - I was only in her dressing room. You and her up to tricks While I'm at lamppost number six But it suits me fine To hang around till half past 9 It wasn't Artie's fault Shalford made him go carving wood - That's good, carving wood? - He had to Yes, and keep her lady waiting A lovely gentleman gives me a thrill When he comes up to say hello - How dare you! - Don't abuse her - I'm not! - Leave him alone - If I'd been there... - You were busy dancing with girls - Girls? - A few, actually. - I don't want to know - I'd have knocked him down. - With your arm in a sling? - Bandaged by Miss Walsingham. Who the heck is Miss Walsingham? For heaven's sake He's got a harem and no mistake Mr Casanova Kipps - Who? - You heard, Bluebeard What about this man of yours on the promenade? A little late to clench your fists And look grim You wouldn't care lf l went with him - You should have - With a stranger? Arthur got along all right While Ann waited all night - You shouldn't talk to men in the dark. - Don't tell me because I'm... - Not talking to you! - Ann! You men are all the same The same beneath the skin You bed a girl by wooing her Then proceed to ruin her - I only kissed you once. - You take a simple girl - And lead her into sin - Men only want one thing Once you have your way with her You don't stay with her It's her who's went and gone And done the crime Come back, Archie!

She's still cross about what happened at the beach. I went to her work, but they wouldn't let me in. - Why not? - I rung the bell and this fellow came out with two dogs. "What are you doing here?" I said, "I come to see Ann." He said, "We got no Ann." I said, "She's a parlormaid." "What's a well-to-do gentleman like you doing with a parlormaid? Be off." He wouldn't let me in. Rum, isn't it? - You should've dropped him a fiver. - I'm not used to tipping. My heart bleeds for you. What are you doing all day now you're home? - I'm very busy. - Doing what? The lawyers get in touch every now and again. I've got a banjo now. I read the Times every day. All the way through. And go for a walk. Sometimes, even a drive. - Sounds very tiring. - Doing nothing. I wouldn't mind doing nothing all day. Mr Kipps, welcome. Buying gifts today, are you? Mr Kipps, welcome. Buying gifts today, are you? Edwin, darling. I really have missed you. Look what I've got you. It's a collar with a bell. He'll get used to it. - Miss Walsingham. - I'm delighted to see you, Mr Kipps. - We read about you in the Gazette. - Yeah? Mama, I'd like you to meet Mr Kipps. - How do you do? - How do you do? - This is my brother, Hubert. - How do you do? I believe we've met before. In the emporium and other vicinities. Do you intend to stay here? I haven't made up me mind. I've inherited me grandfather's house. More comfortable than Mr Shalford's basement. I'll say. Very lonely. Quiet. No snoring. We must do something about that. - Snoring? - No. Perhaps you'd care to take tea with us one day next week. Shall we say Thursday at 4:00? Yes, let's. I could come earlier. No, 4 is quite soon enough. Card. The address. We better find our carriage. Come along, Hubert. - Good day. - Goodbye. Good day. Come on, let's go. "Miss Helen Walsingham. "Bachelor of Arts." She's too far above me By half, she is She'd laugh, she would Not half, she would If I was to say I loved her so Because I do That's the one thing I know She's too far beyond me To kiss somehow "A kiss, " she'd say "What's this?" she'd say And go off With her head up in the air Yeah, she's too far above me To care She's too far above me By half, she is She'd laugh, she would Not half, she would If I was to say I loved her so Because I do That's the one thing I know She's too far beyond me To kiss somehow "A kiss, " she'd say "What's this?" she'd say And go off With her head up in the air Yeah, she's too far above me To care There you are, Mr Kipps, and so punctual. I was early. I've been walking up and down outside. - Not for too long, I trust. - No, about an hour. Shall we go in? Mr Kipps. - How do you do? - Kipps. How good of you to come. We looked for you last night at the Paderewski. - Beg pardon? - The pianoforte player. - He gave a recital at the town hall. - I went to the theater. - Romeo and Juliet at the Royal? - Girls and Garters at the Pally. - A music hall? - It was very good. There was this funny fellow, and he told a riddle. Listen to this. What is it a man does standing up, a girl does sitting down and a dog does on three legs? - Go on. - I have no idea. Shakes hands. Sit down, Mr Kipps. - One lump or two? - Three please. Don't I know you from somewhere? I sold you ribbon at the emporium. Actually, I think it was a camisole, sir. Are you enjoying your affluence, Mr Kipps? - Me what? - Your money. The bank's looking after that. Your money should be working for you. Not sitting in a bank. You should invest it. Be glad to put you onto something good. Would you? That's very generous. I remember now. It was a pair of drawers. You should get down to some serious reading. Nothing enlarges the mind like the classics. I've always wanted to have a good go at reading. - Are you in difficulties, Mr Kipps? - Not really. Not yet. - May I take that, Mr Kipps? - I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. Yes, well... Oh, you're not going. I just remembered, I got another appointment. - At the Pally? - No, I left the gas on. Thank you very much, Mrs Walsingham. It's really very nice of you. You won't believe this, but this is the first time I've ever had tea with friends. - Outside the basement, that is. - You must come again. - Whenever you like. - Do you really mean that? Of course. As you said yourself, we're now your friends. Thank you very much. Should I tip her? I don't wish to be a Philistine. Although it is customary to tip domestics, one should never force a shilling on an acquaintance. It just isn't done. Thank you very much. - Good day, Mr Walsingham. - Good day, Mr Kipps. You know, Arthur, you sometimes hold yourself too cheap. - You don't hold me cheap? - Of course not. You're kind, generous, modest and understanding. And you row quite beautifully. I used to practice with the boys every weekend. - I haven't seen much of them recently. - Perhaps it's just as well. - I had a talk with Mama last night. - Oh, Lord. - Why say that? - I don't think she approves. I see her looking at me sometimes. I suppose I'm just not refined enough. But what if I were to help you? - You'd have to help me a fearful lot. - "Help." "Help", sorry- All these things that trouble you are very little things. I could easily teach you. - You don't mind me telling you? - Of course not. - It only requires a little care. - I daresay I'll soon get into it. Then there's a way in which a gentleman dresses. Never be too dressy. It makes you look like a shop assistant. I mean, like a well-off common person. A real gentleman looks right without looking as though he tried to be right. - More a sort of ease. - You do it all so natural. I mean, you're so nice and refined and educated. Beautiful. I don't know why you haven't been snapped up - by some duke or lord or something. - Dear Arthur. There are no dukes or lords here. This isn't the world, you know. - Just a little English town. - What about me? I've been trying to ask you. Every time I come to your house, you're kind and your brother's clever. - Helping me with my investments. - We're all very fond of you. - Have I got a chance? - Please be patient. Till tomorrow. Till the regatta. - Supposing it rains? - Don't worry. It won't rain.

I went to your work. They wouldn't let me in. I should hope not. You'd get me into trouble. - Thanks for those postcards. - Didn't answer them. I didn't know where you was gonna turn up. - London, Paris, Brighton. - Well, I'm here now, ain't I. Artie? Have you got your half sixpence? I've got mine. Always keep it with me. It's in me other suit. I got so many now, you see. Artie, am I still your girl? I mean, now you're a swell. What's that got to do with it? Look, I'm sorry about the beach that day. Ann, I've got something important to tell you. - Have you? - It's about me and you. Yeah? - Well... - Kipps. Kipps. - Up here, old man. - It's my financial adviser. - He wants to talk about investments. - Artie? Look, where you gonna be? On the bridge. Kipps, just the chap I want to see. We need someone to stroke our scratch Leander Four. - Seems Charley has missed the train. - I'd rather not... - Arthur, you row beautifully. - I stroked the Working Men's Four. - It doesn't matter. - It won't be right. Come along. Absolute nonsense, my dear fellow. You can borrow some gear. Change in there. I don't really think I ought. I'll be watching you from the umpire's launch. - Good luck. - I'll do my best. And I'll see you after the race. There he is. Kipps. Not a bad sort, formerly in trade. I'm making investments on his behalf. Beresford's gear. Club members only. Racing boat, please. Hurry along now. Kipps. Turning out for the opposition, I see then? That's very nice. We've had to volunteer old fatty here. He's about as much use as a cold rice pudding. - I didn't have to come. - We're not good enough these days? - Sorry. - Get out of it. You're another traitor to the proletariat, mate. Pay no attention to them, dear fellow. - Damn cheek if you ask me. - I'm very sorry. Thank you. Thank you. KiPPS- Kipps, come on. Excuse me. All right, get on your stake boats, both crews. If you get off station, I will warn you... - Have a good row! - Show them what's what. - Hey! - Hey! Look. Traitor. Right, now, see that everything is correct, that your stretchers are screwed up properly and that you are ready. Both crews, are you straight? Are you straight? You're sure? When I start you, I shall ask you once if you're ready. If I receive no reply, I shall say "go". ROW! - What are you doing, you twit? - What you doing, you fat lump? Well, he said "go", didn't he?

My lords, ladies and gentlemen. Pray, silence for Lady Botting, donator of the Botting Trophy, who has kindly consented to present her trophy to the winning crew. Up you go, Kipps, old man. Collect the trophy from Lady Botting. - But why me? - The privilege of the winning stroke. Splendid, Mr Kipps, splendid. Congratulations. Thank you very much. Sorry. - Oh, I say. - Arthur, I'm so proud of you. Dear friends. Dear friends, this is truly a memorable occasion. The amazing Mr Kipps has not only won the Botting Trophy, - but the hand of my daughter as well. - Really? Blimey. I mean, go on. Hooray! Here, she's gonna marry me! She is, she really is! I hope you'll both be very happy. Well, I think this calls for champers all around. - Artie! - Ann. How dare you address my fiancé with such familiarity. - Are you gonna marry her? - Of course he's going to marry her. Who are you? Some girl from the shop? - She's in service, actually. - A servant girl? - He belongs to me. - To you? Yeah. And you tell her. Tell her you're not gonna marry her. Tell her quick. - Let me explain. - To this creature? Run along, girl. - This is no affair of yours. - It is my affair. You're not, are you? Are you? Well... Well, we're engaged. - You philanderer. - I was trying to tell you. You never told me nothing. You said you loved me. And you gave me half a sixpence. You can have the bloody thing back. And right this minute. I don't want ever to see you again. - Ann! - And just you keep off. You keep away from me. - Ann! - Arthur, please. I think we'd better take shelter. Come along, my dear. Are you coming, Arthur? The incident is closed, Arthur. We will never refer to it again. Hey, are we going in here? Of course we are. This is Lady Botting's country place. - Oh, Lord. - Whatever is the matter, Arthur? I've been here before. Only last time, they wouldn't let me in. Does a gentleman ever get sick? - Why? - I think I'm gonna be. Stop fidgeting, Arthur. This collar, it's cutting me head off. - "My-ll - "Head." "Off." I suggest you say as little as possible at dinner. Leave the conversation to us. And try not to perspire. A gentleman never perspires. - Doesn't he? - Never. Mrs Walsingham. Miss Helen Walsingham. Mr Hubert Walsingham. Mr Arthur Kipps. Helen. You can't go walking about like that. What on earth are you talking about? You'll catch your death. It's extremely fashionable. You people are such prudes. "You people"? Oh, Mr Kipps. Very nice. Thank you. Excuse me. The Kaiser? Kaiser? Germany. Lord, Ann. Do you request something, sir? No. My lords, ladies and gentlemen, dinner is served. - What's that? - Gfufs poché Richelieu, sir. - "Erf" what? - Poché Richelieu. - Oh, posh. - It looks delicious. Cold eggs on salmon mousse. Why didn't he say so in the first place then? - What's all the jelly stuff? - Aspic. Cold poached eggs in jelly. Very nice. Use the fork. - Which? There's an army of them. - The one furthest from the plate. Not mine, yours. - Don't use the knife. - Well, I gotta cut it up, haven't I? Use the fork. Just the fork. So clever of you, to trace your future brother-in-law's genealogy and discover the real spelling of "Kipps". - It's the Flemish way, you know? - Yes. So much nicer, C-U-Y-P-S. Yes. "Coips." "Coops"? "KVPPers"? "Cuyps-II I II "Cuyps-II Very nice. - Leave it. The footman will take it. - I'm hungry. - "Hungry-u - Hungry! Got it. Take it easy. That cost me two guineas, that shirt. Arthur, please. Leave it alone. Ignore it. What's the matter now? I'm using the ruddy fork, aren't I? Fletcher, I think you better serve the next course. Very good, milady. I didn't wanna come, they made me. Remove that mess at once. And take that girl with you. Yes, milady. You'll pay for those breakages, girl. And you'll stay in your next three half-days. I think you're being far too lenient. What's this keeping in and stopping money? - It's not about you. - Yes, it is. - Ann, you all right? - Well! Has this one been knocking you about? Well, have you? Don't worry about that. I'll pay for the damage. What, about 5 sovereigns, that'll cover it, won't it? - Such rudeness is unforgivable. - Mind your own business. - What? - You heard. - Where are you going? - After her. - But, Arthur, we're engaged. - I'm sorry, Helen. - You're on your own. - The wedding? - It's off. - Young man, come back here. Don't you start again. I've had about enough of you. One more "Cuyps", "Coops", or "pish-posh-pooches", and so help me, I'll belt you! Good evening...and goodbye, Mrs Walsingham. Ann! Ann! Ann. Ann'? - Ann? - Go away. - Open the door. - Leave me alone! - If you don't open it, I'll smash it in! - All right, see if I care. I Will! I want to marry you, Ann. You can't marry me. You're engaged to that girl, you can't be engaged to me. I don't want to be engaged. I've been engaged. I want to be married to you, now. What do you mean? I mean come away and marry me before anyone else does. I can't. It wouldn't be fair to Lady Botting. I haven't given notice. - You gotta think about me, not her. - And what about me? You haven't treated me very proper. That's how I am. I'm all wrong, and I never said I wasn't. I made a fool of myself, isn't that enough? I've got myself tied up with everyone. I made a fool of myself all around. But now I know what I want and what I don't want. I just throwed everything away up there. Everything. I haven't got a friend in the world now. I'm desperate. I'll make it all up to you if you come, Ann. Will you come? If you don't answer me, Ann, I'm going right out of here. If you don't answer me, I'll... Might as well throw myself in the sea. It'll have to be the pier. Artie! Don't drown yourself. Not yet. I've been so miserable, Ann. Artie. You really will come? You really will marry me? Yes. Mind you... ...I won't do this for just anyone. I'm so miserable, Ann. They sometimes listen on the stairs. I've been so... Dear me! All right, love? All lined up in a wedding group Here we are for a photograph We're all dressed up in a morning suit All trying not to laugh Since the early caveman, in his fur Took a trip to Gretna Green There's always been a photographer To record the happy scene Hold it, flash What a picture What a picture What a photograph Poor old bloke, what a joke Hat blown off in a cloud of smoke Clap hands Stamp your feet Bang it on the big bass drum What a picture What a picture Stick it in your family album No, wait, stay where you are. King Henry VIII had several wives Including Anne Boleyn And he kept an album of their lives With all their photos in As Anne Boleyn was on her knees Dressed in her very best frock King Henry shouted "Smile, dear, please" As her head rolled off the block Hold it, flash What a picture What a picture What a photograph Comes the print In a little while - Lost her head - But she kept her smile Clap hands Stamp your feet Bang it on the big bass drum What a picture What a picture Stick it in your family album Stick it in your family album You got a lovely girl there. - There she is, my bride. - Your bride! You've read it in a folio Or seen the Shakespeare play How Juliet fell for Romeo In the merry month of May And as he climbed the orchard wall To reach his lady fair As he tumbled she began to bawl As he traveled through the air Hold it, flash What a picture What a picture What a photograph Poor old bloke Couldn't see the joke - Tights all torn - And his doublefs broke Clap hands Stamp your feet Bang it on the big bass drum What a picture What a picture Stick it in your family album When Napoleon married Josephine There was just the same to-do He gal/oped home from the battle All the way from Waterloo And as he came from off his horse To the boudoir where she sat - She said to him - In French, of course.

What did we stop for? Look over there. I don't see anything. You will one day. That's gonna be our new house. I've just bought the land. We got one house already. That's my grandfather's. It's old. This one's gonna be brand-new. Just the sort of place you've always dreamed of. Lovely. Lovely. These are the plans for the new residence. Lovely, lovely. I mean, very nice. - It looks like a museum. - Ann. I'm sure Mrs Kipps will be only too happy to leave this Gothic monstrosity. It was left me by my grandfather. The foundations are almost done, so it's not too soon to discuss the internal details. - What? - The décor, Madam. I've had a ripping idea for the bedrooms. Everything in tartan, like the queen at Balmoral. - Very distinguished, chic. - Very la-di-da. - "La-di-da." - The queen, Ann. Each room can be its own tartan: MacMurray, MacDonald, MacDougall... Hang on a minute. How many bedrooms are you building? Eleven. Eleven? Well, we don't want that many. We only want one. I've reconsidered, Mr Wilkins. We will need a billiard room. What? What for? A man in Mr Kipps' position must be proficient in social graces. We are gonna do a lot of entertaining. And with this house, he can entertain everybody. I don't want him entertaining everyone. Why can't we just have a little house? You know, Mr Wilkins, these really are nice. Well, don't put any in my bedroom. - Sorry about that, Mr Wilkins. - Oh, not at all. Say no more. Perhaps I'd better come back tomorrow. Mr Kipps. If I might offer you a word of advice? Man to man, you understand? As men of standing, we are obligated to be masters in our own homes. We couldn't rule the world if we weren't supreme at home. Of course, it's up to you. But do remember your position. And that of Mrs Kipps. Good afternoon to you. - Well? - You made a fool of me. - Well, aren't you? - What's that mean? Eleven bedrooms? You make me laugh. A man has to be master in his own home. - You're cleaning? Where's the girl? - Out. - Out? What do you mean? - Out! I gave her the day off. I do it better myself anyway. - What's these? - What? - Calling cards. - Well, they're calling cards. "Mrs G. Porrit Smith." "Miss Porrit Smith." "Miss Mabel Porrit Smith." "The Reverend G. Porrit Smith..." Reverend. Cor, clergy. Actually, it was quite funny. I mean, there was this woman, you see, and two little girls, - and this funny little fellow. - Whafd they say? They says to me... Because I've got me apron and hat on. - "Is Mrs Kipps at home?" - Yeah. I says, "No." And then they gave me those cards and they went. Why did this have to happen? Clergy and all! You ought to have known better. - I didn't know visitors were coming. - You're supposed to know! These good people want to associate with us, and you go and slap them in the face. - I didn't slap anybody in the face. - There's only one thing for it. - Return the call. - How? - Take them a card. - I won't. - You must. - I won't! There they go off, but we don't ever see them again. And so it goes. We're not gonna know anybody. And will you put yourself out or take the trouble to find out anything about...? Will you stop shouting at me? You're always shouting! I ought never to have married you. I'm not equal to this position. Well, you can try, can't you? I've improved, why can't you? Instead of sending out the girl and cleaning. - Then visitors... - I don't care about visitors! You're supposed to! I'm going. - Where? - Out! - What do you mean? - To see my adviser. - Why? - About the 11 bedrooms. I don't want 11 bedrooms! Financial adviser. Eleven bedrooms. Do you hear that? Eleven. Well, you can sleep in them. Tartan. MacDougall, MacDonald. And a billiard room. For entertaining everyone. "No, I'm sorry. Mrs Kipps isn't home." Oh, something's wrong. What does he think he's doing? I know what! am I was brought up in a simple way I know what! am Ordinary and simple, come what may I know what! am I don't hold with mutton Dressed as lamb Being gents Don't make sense I know what! am I know what! am When it comes to high society I know what! am Just a feeling here, inside of me I know what! am I just can't abide What's false and sham Calling cards La-di-da's I know what! am There's been a copper outside all morning. - Excuse me. - Move along, sir. You can't go in. - I got to. My financial adviser's there. - All right. Helen? Well, look. What's up? There's some policemen downstairs. Where's your brother? I don't quite know how to begin to tell you. Are you all right? Would you be so kind as to pass that decanter? Thank you. Here's to old times. Or is that impolite? Perhaps we should drink to married life, Arthur. You've had a few, haven't you? It's supposed to give one courage. And my family needs a lot of courage right now. I think you better sit down. You'd better pour yourself a drink. What do you mean? This is from my brother. It's addressed to you. Go on. Read it. "My dear Helen. "Gone abroad for a time. "Police inquiries. "Possible charge against me for fraudulent conversion." What's that? Using his clients' money. Losing it... ...and not paying it back. He's been speculating my money. He's run off. I'm afraid so. But is there none of it left? Nothing. He signed away your entire capital as security at the bank. But even that wasn't enough. The bank informed the police that he'd gone. But he can't do that. That's my 1,250 a year. I haven't had it long. A lot of people have been hurt, Arthur. My mother will have to sell our house. - And I shall have to find work. - Yeah, but what about me? I can't go back to Shalford's and face that basement again. - I'm sorry. - You're sorry, that's a lot of good. You're educated, you can get a job. But me, I'm right in it, I am. I've got nothing. No qualifications, no trade, nothing. I can't go back. I'm a gentleman, thanks to your family. - You have Ann. - How can I face her? - She's your wife. - Where is he? We don't know. - Probably in France. - It's not fair! It's just not fair. - You shouldn't have brought the cat. - Go on. Why? He's all right, isn't he, Flo? He's here. He's here. The rumor was true, then. - And all your money's gone? - Too bad. But then I always knew it wouldn't do you any good. It's the system, mate. I'd like to help out, old chap. But I'm a bit short myself at the moment. These are the completed plans for your new residence. This house will provide you with the background to entertain everybody. To entertain, to entertain, to entertain, to entertain... My lords, ladies and gentlemen! Mr Harry Chitterlow and Miss Laura Livermore. Messrs Sid, Buggins and Pearce. Messrs Sid, Buggins and Pearce. This is my world A world of splendor Swanky and rich and fine This is a world I won't surrender Now that I've made it mine A world that is full of wonderful things Dukes and their duchesses Nobles and kings I'll be king for more than a day Whatever they say I'll keep it that way For this is the world That I was meant for This is the world for me I wouldn't give a blooming cent for Life as it used to be For now that I'm tasting The pleasures of life Even a fool can see That this is my world A world of splendor Swanky and rich and fine This is a world I won't surrender Now that I've made it mine For this is the world That I was meant for This is the world for me I wouldn't give a blooming cent for Life as it used to be For now that I'm tasting The pleasures of life Even a fool can see That this is my world This is my world This is my world And this is the world for me Ann. You're not dressed proper. Look at your hair. You're letting me down again. You're letting yourself down. These are my friends. Everything's for you. For yourself, you mean. Your friends. Look at them. Once a draper, always a draper. No gentleman, and never will be. Scruffy orphan. No idea of anything, never did and never will. Artie? Where have you been? Oh, it doesn't matter. I've seen the boys, and they've told me about the money. - Walsingham has been speculating. - I know. I've been trying to work things out, but I don't know where to begin. I've been cross with you. I've been a fool about things. Them 11 bedrooms, them calling cards. Those things don't matter. The only thing that matters is that we loved each other. And we did. I think you better go and leave me on me own for a bit. What? I've just married you. I'm staying with you, no matter what. I wanted it all to be marvelous for you. I wanted a big house and pretty clothes and things. I suppose the truth is I only wanted it for myself. Oh, Artie. What I'm trying to say is... ...I'm sorry. I really am very sorry. I'd like to say I'll make it up to you, cross me heart. I wouldn't even know where to begin. What to do, what to say. They all laughed at me. You never did. All I ever wanted was you. And I've got you. Haven't I? No one can speculate that. Oh, you are lovely. Mr Chitterlow. Oh, my dear. My dear Kipps and Mrs K. My play. Oh, dear, my play. - Oh, it ain't. - It is. It's a great, big, whacking, enormous success. No. It'll run two years if it runs a day. Here's your check. The first on your half-share. And more. There'll be thousands more. - I don't want money any more. - It's yours. You had faith in my play. No, it only brings trouble. Artie. We could have a little house. And a proper kitchen. And no backstairs. Eleven bedrooms. No. Oh, you. I'll take it. - But... - You got no pockets. Our ship's come in, dears. Where's me motor? - Behind you. - Yes. We'll spread the glad tidings. Who's coming to town for a glass of the old Methuselah? - No, thanks. - Goodbye. Bye. Cheerio! - Bye. - Where are they going? What you grinning at? I was just thinking. Penny for them? Old Chitterlow, all this money. I was thinking what a rum go everything is. That's what I was thinking. Come on. Remember that half a romance ls better than none But when I'm with you One and one make two And likewise, two half sixpences Joined together make one
