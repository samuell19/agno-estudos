"Pass your tongue over her lips until you find her tongue." Then move it gently, alternating the rhythm from slow to more intense. "It seems difficult, but you learn with practice." Don't look at me, you queer. Get off! You've got a message. Eric, you've got a message. NEW MESSAGE FROM "ESPANOL" What a shitty website. Up with Spain! The further up and the further away, the better. Long Live Free Catalonia. He's sent you another. We know who you are. Shut down this site, or we'll stab you like a pig. Who is this guy? Just a troll. Really? Then I'll ask my friends from ETA to plant a bomb under your ass Take that, shithead. It was a drag, but can take more work now. The repairs cost me ?400. There'll be more soon.

We could go together one day. What is it? Nothing. Yes, that would be nice. HAVE YOU FELT HER TITS? ANSWER ME! Another friend. You have a lot of friends. That's 8 or 9 messages already. I've switched it off now. Look at this. Captain, we know who sent the mail. We have proof that the accused shouted their support for the terrorist organization ETA. Such acts are in contravention of article 578 of Spanish law. The prosecution requests a two year prison sentence. Hope what you need isn't urgent. I'm up to my ears in work. Thanks. Take a look at this What you're reading was written by a minor. We need a favorable report in order to get a warrant. See. "The Army of the Phoenix"? What is it? We're not really sure, but they send threats to companies to force them to use Catalan. Adam, did you tell Eric to go to sleep? Who could that be at this hour? Eric. Come down. Are you Eric? Yes. Do you also use the name Phoenix 1,123? No, Phoenix 11-23. I'm Captain Cardenosa. This is a search warrant. A search warrant? What for? We're here about an act of terrorism. Okay, let's go. Terrorism? That can't be. What do you mean "terrorism"? He's accused of sending threats. Excuse me, that computer is mine. We have to take it, kid. But have my university work on it. Dad, they're taking my computer. Put all this stuff in boxes. Captain. Bring it in. Get me a bolt cutter. Excuse me. have the key. Give him the key. Are you going to arrest him? We'll see. Tomorrow morning, bring Eric in to make a statement. 10 o'clock at the Civil Guard station in Blanes. He can stay here tonight, under your responsibility. No, there must be some mistake. You've got the wrong person. No, we haven't made a mistake. See you tomorrow. Eric. What have you done? Haven't done anything. They say you made threats. - They knew your name. - haven't done anything! You didn't do anything on the net? No... sent an email to a supermarket asking them to label things in Catalan. - Did you threaten anyone? - No! - Sure? - swear didn't. No, you're a saint. The anti-terrorist brigade just barged in here, - because you haven't done anything! - Damn it! Who knows what he's done. He said he hasn't done anything. Yeah, right. We need a lawyer. Told you he shouldn't have Internet in his room. EVERYTHING FOR OUR FATHERLAND DANGEROUS TERRORISTS Good morning, I'm the lawyer for Eric Bertran - I'm here for the interview. - Over there. Hello, I'm Emilio Colmenero. We spoke this morning. You must be Eric, the star of the show. Gentlemen, you can come in now. Let's go. Come in, Eric. Sit down here. You can sit here. Take a seat. I'm Emilio Colmenero, the boy's lawyer. Who reported him? - What? - Who reported him? Counselor, at this stage of the procedure, - you know can't say. - Yes, of course. By law have to arrest Eric in order to question him. Don't worry, it's just procedure. Must inform you, that you have the right to remain silent and not answer my questions. If you don't want to. Is that clear? Do you wish to make a statement? - Yes. - Yes. All right. Today, October 1 st, 2004, Eric Bertran Martinez confirmed, at nine minutes past ten, and in the presence of his lawyer, that he will make a statement. All right, Eric. Do you recognise this? Yes. Are you the webmaster? Yes. The site is called "The Army of the Phoenix". No, it's in Catalan. "Exercit del Fenix". And why is it called "The Army of the Phoenix"? Got the name from a Harry Potter book. Harry Potter? Yes. That boy who goes to a school for wizards. Yes, know who Harry Potter is. What do you do on this website? Lots of things. We exchange ideas, we have campaigns to defend Catalan. That's about it really. Are you the author of this email? - Yes. - Can see it? Of course. Did the company ever reply? No. In that email, you say that if they didn't reply, you would contact them again What were you planning to do? Nothing. Send more emails asking them to label stuff in Catalan. You were going to send them masses of emails. Not exactly masses. People from the website would've sent more protest emails until they listened to us. See. - Hello? - It's me. The kid has admitted he wrote the email. See. Send me everything you have. Was what he wrote a threat? No, he only said that if they ignored him, the next time, he wouldn't ask so nicely. It may not be a very friendly way of asking but a threat is when someone says they will harm you, and they are capable of doing so. The law is clear about that. Then why did 30 civil guards come to my house? Suppose when they read "The Army of the Phoenix", they wanted to check it They're jumpy. The train bombings in Madrid, ETA, Al Qaeda... One more thing, Eric. Is there anything else that could cause problems? No, no. Sure? Sure. Once they see that The Army of the Phoenix is nothing sinister, they'll drop it. Believe me. They must already know they've screwed up. Just in case, don't go online until all this is over. - Can't say what happened? - No, Eric. Forget about the website. Don't forget they will be investigating you. - But the guys on the forum - Eric! Didn't you hear him? Eric, get in the car. Kids can do silly things. Keep an eye on him. Okay. Goodbye, Rosa. Goodbye. Adam, come here a moment. Here you go. Miquel at work doesn't use it any more. It's yours. Does it work? Of course. You stay away from it. - Hello? - Mireia? Eric! What are you doing? Not much. Walking Hotblack. What's up? You didn't answer my messages. My computer is broken. - When will it be fixed? - don't know. Miss you. Me too. Can we meet some day? - Yes, but can't get to Barcelona - What about in Lloret? I'm going this weekend with my family. Really? What about your homework? - Have to go now. - Okay, I'll call you. Come on, up here. Let's go! We'll be following the intense political activity this weekend of the Spanish and Catalan parties. Mum, will you take me to Lloret? Have you swept up the leaves? I'll do it tomorrow. Mum? No, not tomorrow. We said you'd do it today. Have to meet someone. No, you don't. If he says he'll do it tomorrow... Let the kid do as he pleases, right? You know what you have to do. Forget it, I'll get the bus. - Don't walk out that door - Go to hell! - Eric! - Eric, don't be stupid. Eric! I'M NOT ALLOWED OUT. SORRY. REALLY MISS YOU. Eric. Eric, let me copy off you. Eric, come here 3 moment. Didn't you have a website called "Army of the Phoenix"? Yes. - Is this you in the newspaper? - What? TEENAGER ACCUSED OF TERRORISM FOR QUOTING HARRY POTTER BOOK Have you been accused of terrorism? Can't talk about it. Right. Okay, go back to your desk. Terrorist? What could they do to you? Don't know. The lawyer says nothing. Hey, "indie"! What is it? - Did they catch you planting bombs? - Screw you! Watch out for Eric's backpack, it might explode. How come it's in the papers? They talking about my son as if he were ETA. - Don't understand - No, it's not that. The Civil Guard sometimes inform the press to pin medals on themselves. And this is some medal. How brave of them. We should go to the press. We need to tell the truth. Yeah, right. Yes, Dad, we'll talk to them and clear all this up. - Clear all this up? - Yes, why not? Because say so! Eric, your dad is right. We don't want a public debate. It would make this seem bigger than it is. How are you, guys? Hello. How are you all? Read about it in the paper. All this stuff about... The police came for Eric, right? Yes, but they made a mistake. See. If you need anything, the party might be able to help. Thanks, Eduard, but there's no need Adam, are you done? Rosa, if you need anything, here's my phone number. Thanks a lot. Come on, boys. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye, Eric. Why are you home so early? Miquel gave the job to someone else. So you're not working? Not today, or tomorrow, or the next day. It's over. With what little work there was... And the other clients hardly have anything But did something happen? They saw the newspaper, that's what happened. Xavi, did you see that? No way! That wasn't a foul! - They're bullies. - Did you see what they did? Well, "indie"? What a thrashing! Spain 3 - Catalonia 0. Just ignore him. - I'll take that. - Hey! - You want it? - Give it back. - Come and get it. - Give it back. Give it to me! Shit! - Come and get it. - Give it to him. I'll give it to you, on one condition. - Say that you're Spanish. - Fuck off. - Say that you're Spanish. - won't do it. Just say that you're Spanish. Give it to me, damn it Give it back, man. Repeat after me: am Spanish. No way! - Long live Spain. - won't say it. Say that you're Spanish, go on! What's going on here? Joan. Nothing. Okay, everybody out. Eric, get dressed. - Hello. - Hello, son. How was school? Fine. Hello. Hello.What are you doing? Shopping with my mum. Want to see you. Are you coming to Lloret? No, not for a while. Want to show you a cove. It's really beautiful. Are you the one in the newspapers? Yes, but ifs a police error. Why didn't you tell me? Didn't want to tell you by phone. - Shall try to come to Barcelona? - No, you'd better not. Mireia? Have to hang up. Mireia, didn't do anything. Can't talk now. Don't call me. Bye. - He called me. - Then don't answer. Don't want you to talk to him. Let's go. Captain, look at this Found something? Yes, so far, we have this. They go from this to planting bombs. Catalonia isn't the Basque Country. That's right, and we want to keep it that way Hello. I've had some problems. What's this? - Nothing. - Is that the website? Are you out of your mind? Just wanted to tell them... Are you stupid? You can't tell them anything. What did the lawyer say? - Don't you ever listen? - What's up? I'll tell you what's up. Brought a computer home and now he's talking to his friends on the net. As if he hadn't done enough damage. Do you want to go to prison? - No. - Then do as you're told. Go to bed! We can't leave him for two minutes. - Morning. - Morning. Does Eric Bertran live here? Who are you? My name's Carme. I'm Nuria Cadenas's mother. Someone in the village told me he lives here. Are you his mother? What do you want? Thought might be able to help. Thanks, but we don't need help. My daughter was accused of terrorism and she spent six years in prison. Come in. Quite a downpour. May sit? Yes, sure. My husband. - Hello. - Hello. Her daughter was accused of terrorism. - What did she do? - Has Eric done anything? Neither did Nuria, she was just an independence activist. She was 17, still at school. One day, in town with her dad, a car pulled up and two plain-clothes policemen took her away in handcuffs. Just like that? With no evidence? At trial they produced her school chemistry notes as evidence that she was making bombs. But we live in a democracy. A democracy where they can arrest you and hold you for five days with no lawyer or phone call. But that's nothing to do with us. No? What about your Eric? Don't know about your daughter, but with Eric it's different. Think you should leave. All right. But look. These are all cases of torture, judicial proceedings and accusations of terrorism in the past few years. These are political prisoners from the '92 Olympics. Two had a banner saying "Freedom for Catalonia". They were tortured day and night and 38 other people were arrested. Thanks to political pressure they didn't go to prison. Spain couldn't have all the world's TVs showing "Freedom for Catalonia". Yes, but Eric only sent an email. Defending Catalan is enough. Look. November 9th, 1997, Josep Anton Cunat, Mayor of Favara, arrested for addressing the Civil Guard in Catalan. Just for using Catalan. There are many cases of fines and abuse from the police for using Catalan, here in the Principality, in the Balearics, Valencia... It's a war and Eric is just another victim. A war? That's enough. I'd like you to leave now. Okay, but there is something you should do. Get help from associations and political parties, go to the press, tell people about this. layout don't, Eric will end up in prison. Maybe we should talk to someone. - What about? - About everything she said. Rosa, don't tell me you believe her. Don't know. They locked up her daughter, she's just trying to defend her. Eric, Pau! Come and play. Come on! Come on, lads! Get Eric! Come on! Get the terrorist! Open his legs. They're hitting him. What? Using hands doesn't count! It does against terrorists. - Stop that! - Son of a bitch! Fucking terrorist! Let him go! Get over there. Are you all right? Who can tell me what happened? Who started it? Nobody, we were playing "nutmeg". You weren't playing, you were fighting. They ganged up on me. No, we were just playing the game. Bullshit! You were all after me. You grabbed the can with your hand. If you play that game again, you're all expelled. Do you understand? And you, Eric, outside school you can do what you like, but don't want trouble here Understood? - Is that understood? - Yes. Now get out of here. - Hello, son. - Hello. - What happened to you? - fell over. - You fell? Let me see. - fell over playing a game. Playing a game? - Did they clean it? - Yes. Let's go. Has your terrorist friend left you all alone? You dropped your folder. Pick it up. Run off home. Mummy's waiting. The High Court prosecutor wants to question Eric. Next week we have to go to Madrid. To the High Court? Where the terrorists go? Yes. Yes. can't believe it. Unless there's something else in that computer. Knew it! What is it, Eric? - Ferran... - What's in that computer? Ferran! And what could happen now? According to the law, technically, they could sentence him to... eight years in a youth prison. But that's impossible. Eight years? Eric, what's in that computer? And don't say nothing, because they must have something. There's nothing, okay? Nothing! Don't you believe me? They're after me because I'm an activist, because bother them! Eric! Eric, come here! Ferran, we don't know for sure that they've found anything. - What are you doing? - Looking for a number. Whose number? - Eduard's. - Eduard who? From Esquerra Republicana? - Yes. - Why call him? He might be able to help. Help? Help with what? Rosa, don't bring political parties into this. Eric has to go to Madrid, can't just sit here and watch them lock him up. And going with an independence party to the High Court in Madrid is a better idea. Your problem is you don't trust your son - Did you drop it? - He dropped his folder. Sorry, stepped on a page. You've forgotten some. - There's one more here. - Hurry up, you'll be late. See you later. Left your boyfriend at home today? Hey, Pau, there's a place here. Pa... Okay, sit down, let's get started. Guillem, will you stop that? One photocopy per pair. It says that organic chemistry is basically... Paul What's the matter? Nothing. We don't have to go everywhere together. It happened in the Basque Country with the "Egunkaria" newspaper. They accused them of supporting ETA. And they even tortured the staff. Aren't they members of ETA? Of course not. That's the problem. You can be accused of terrorism without having committed any crime. And what can we do now? First, we call Puig, our MP in Madrid. He can start hassling the Minister for Justice We need the attention of the media. The only thing that terrifies them is getting a bad press. And start a petition, to show we're not alone. - Adam, are you ready? - One second. SIGN FOR ERIC BERTRAN - Hello. - Hello, Rosario. Thank you. Could help, if you want. Okay. Will you sign a petition for Eric Bertran? They want to lock him up for defending Catalan. Like with Franco? Yes, I'll sign. Will you sign? My son has been accused of terrorism... Will you sign our petition? My son has been accused of terrorism... The kid who threatened a company? No, it's not true. He must have done something to get accused. He must have done something to get accused. Give me that. - Interview Eric? - That's rig ht. - On TV? - Yes, on the morning show. No, no. No, no. - We can't. - Why not? Don't want people to recognise him in the street. Going on TV could help us a lot. Know, but don't want it. - Not that. - Okay, it's your call. - Think it over and let me know. - Okay, thanks, Eduard. - Think it over and let me know. - Okay, thanks, Eduard. - Bye. - Bye. Mum, why can't go on TV? Don't want everyone knowing you're accused of terrorism. But could show that I'm innocent. But could show that I'm innocent. There are idiots out there You could get beaten up. Already have been. They've been bullying me at school. I've got a visitor, I'll call you back. Eric says he was assaulted. Really? Had no idea. Had no idea. And the day he had a cut eyebrow? Eric had a fight in the playground. Not a fight. Several boys beat him up. That's his version of it. Know my son and believe him. Listen, Madam, Listen, Madam, in this school there are more than 500 pupils, and your son is the only one accused of terrorism. So his version doesn't inspire much confidence. Wouldn't you say? Eric, let's go. This is an email from Rosa Maria Martinez. Hello, m the mother of Eric, a 14 year-old from Lloret, accused of being a terrorist for sending emails "asking why products weren't labeled in Catalan." Eric, how do you feel? Better now. I'm getting a lot of support. Accused of terrorism, aged just 14. Sent an email asking them to label stuff in Catalan and they interpreted it as a threat. You're sure those emails weren't meant as a threat. My lawyer says they weren't very respectful. My lawyer says they weren't very respectful. You're philosophical about it now, but imagine that night you didn't sleep too well. Going to the High Court in Madrid doesn't make any sense. Yes, hold on. It's the SER Network Yes, hold on. It's the SER Network Tell them to wait. I'm with these people. - I've finished. - Have you? Rosa, I'll see you in a minute. Hello. Full house today, huh? Hello. Full house today, huh? Hello, Ferran. Look what I've got. More than 2,000 signatures from all over the place and hundreds of messages of support. Give them to the Prosecutor. They'll shit themselves. Give them to the Prosecutor. They'll shit themselves. Let's prepare for the interview. It'll be like last time, so you know the score. Will be able to do it in Catalan? Will be able to do it in Catalan? Wouldn't ask for an interpreter, they could see it as provocation. Why? have the right to speak my own language, don't? Yes. Yes. Then I'll do it in Catalan. Don't think it will be a problem. No, that's fine. Okay, Eric, they're going to ask you questions. When you answer, remember that for them When you answer, remember that for them appearances are very important. They want to see that you're a normal boy and not some radical who bombs buses. Okay? Yes. When they ask about the email, it's important you say that at no point was it your intention to threaten. Was it your intention to threaten. - You didn't want to, did you? - No. Good. And if they ask if you would do it again, obviously, you say no. That wouldn't ask for labels in Catalan? - Didn't do anything wrong. - know that Eric. It's important that you say you're sorry. - Sorry for what? - Eric! If say sorry, it's like saying they're right. - No, it's not. - Yes. It's admitting that deserve this, being treated like a terrorist. You started this. If you hadn't threatened them, You started this. If you hadn't threatened them, we'd all be better off. Do as they say and get this over with. They invented these threats because I'm defending my language. If I'd threatened them because the print was too small, do you think they would have reported it? I'm not apologizing to anybody. If you want to be a fool, go ahead. Eight years for a stupid email. If you want to go to jail, go ahead. "Thanks for defending our country, and our language. "Thanks for defending our country, and our language. Thanks for everything, brother." "Phoenix, your friends in Mallorca, send you their support." "Keep going, don't give in.

It's not a threat. Have read it, Eric, and you made a threat. And that's very serious. It's not true. Can you show it to me? Let me see. Actually, don't have it to hand. But it doesn't matter, what matters... It does matter. want to see the mail. Understood him.Thank you. Don't have the email here. Then who does have it? Eric, you're not in a position to demand anything. Here is the email. This is what you wrote: " expect a reply with either a "yes" or "no". If haven't received one by October 1st, 2004, will think you are ignoring me. Then won't ask you again politely. My whole organization will demand you translate it, "and they won't ask so nicely." Isn't that a threat? No, it only says won't be very nice. That's all. Is it true you intended to bombard them with emails if they didn't answer you? No, just wanted to send more protest mails. But on your website forum you told a friend that on the October 1st, 2004 you will bombard them with emails. And this Post-it, which was found in your room, says "bombard". Didn't put that in the mail It's a way of talking with friends, just wanted to send more protest mails. But you said it to your friend. But that's private. never threatened anyone. Do you know what "bombard with emails" means in computing terms? Yes, do. Make a note of that, he was aware. Just said it to a friend! But you knew what it meant so you were aware - of what you were doing. - can tell my friend anything like. All right. But it's a threat to speak that way. Madam prosecutor, may? Go ahead, counselor. Tell me, Eric. Did you have a program capable of sending a bombardment of emails which could jam their website? No. When you sent the mail, where you expecting a reply? Yes. And you gave your email address so they could reply, didn't you? Yes. Madam prosecutor, isn't it weird for someone who intends to commit a crime to supply their email address? Isn't that strange? Let's see, Eric. On your website, you make references to terrorist organizations like ETA. Not me. Those were written by people who visit the site. Did you know about this? No, didn't. Of course. Your user name is Phoenix1123, correct? Yes. Then tell me about this, Eric. I'll read it word for word. Then I'll ask my friends from ETA to plant a bomb under your ass This is signed by Phoenix1123. - Can see that? - Of course. The fascists threatened to stab me. - Wanted to scare them. - Did you write it? Yes or no? Do you know what this means, Eric? This is glorifying terrorism. You can't even mention terrorist gangs, Eric. Don't you care that fascists threatened to kill me? - Me and anyone different to them. - That's not why we're here. - But he's right. - didn't say you could speak. Now then, Eric We found this in the hard drive of your PC. It's an of fence to burn the Spanish ?ag. - Did you know that? - No. Well, it is. A serious crime, punishable under Spanish law. But didn't burn any ?ag. Don't care, having images like this is just as bad. Is it? Got it from Google. Why don't you charge them? Don't get smart with me, Eric. This is desecration of the ?ag. Our flag, your ?ag. My ?ag? Only have one ?ag and it isn't the Spanish one. The Spanish ?ag is your flag because you're Spanish. I'm not Spanish. You are Spanish, like it or not. I'm from Burgs and I'm also Spanish. You're Catalan but you're also Spanish. You must respect your ?ag. I'm Catalan and do respect my ?ag. - You're Catalan and Spanish. - I'm Catalan. You're Spanish, like it or not. You are Spanish, aren't you? Eric, asked you a question. want you to answer me. You are Spanish, aren't you? Are you Spanish? - Know what am. - Say you're Spanish or I'll lock you up! - Madam prosecutor... - Counselor, please. Eric, for the last time, say that you're Spanish. Very well, Eric. Have it your way. What did the prosecutor say? To be honest, I've never been in a situation like that. They maintain the accusation of threats and now he's also accused of glorifying terrorism and desecrating the flag, so... Rosa, how is your son? This isn't a legal issue any more, this is a political issue. So the politicians need to sort it out. Otherwise it's hopeless. They'll lock me up. No. We'll leave the country before that happens. I'M OUTSIDE. ERIC. Hello. Hello. How are you? Fine. A bit busy. Lots of people are helping me. We won't make it easy for them. Thanks for calling me before the hearing. It helped me. Could we go to the cinema some day? Yes. Mireia, what are you doing? Come back inside. I'll be right up. Told you to come inside. Mireia! Come back inside. Let's go somewhere else. We can't talk here. Mireia! In Manresa? Okay. Yes, of course. Thanks a lot. Goodbye. They want to do a protest in Manresa. That was "Platform for the Defense of Catalan". They asked if we want to go. Hello? In Molins DE Rei? Stand here, and when tell you, walk out. Wait a moment. Now. Independence! Independence! ERIC, WE'RE WITH YOU Look, Mum, look WE SPEAK CATALAN WE ARE ALL ERIC Yes, know the supermarket has withdrawn the complaint. Don't need any specific accusation to continue with the trial. Of course there is evidence. Yes, but ifs my job to... All right.l understand. Goodbye. - Hello. - Hello. - What is it? - have some urgent news. Have you read this part? Do you know what this means? Case closed. It's over. FINALLY, ON MARCH 30TH, 2005, THE HIGH COURT CLOSED THE CASE AGAINST ERIC BERTRAN. HIS FAMILY REQUESTED COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES FROM THE SPANISH JUSTICE AND INTERIOR MINISTRIES. THE CLAIM WAS REJECTED ERIC ENROLLED AT A NEW SCHOOL AND HAS CONTINUED FIGHTING FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE CATALAN LANDS They came in and they looked at everything: his wallet, his school diary... They held his pens up to the light to see if they were pen bombs. See you're in good spirits. At the High Court today, Eric Bertran, the boy from Lloret accused of terrorism. Accompanied by his family representatives of CiU, ERC and ICV, and "Platform for the Defense of Catalan". What upset you most? When they said was Spanish whether liked it or not and that should keep the signatures as a souvenir. The signatures you collected in a campaign of support? She said it was scary that so many people thought like me. - The prosecutor said that? - Yes. There were pictures from the internet on the website of Spanish ?ags burning. They called it ?ag desecration Eric is an example of courage for all democrats. And welcome him here today. Continue with your example of honesty and courage. Mr. Puig, you've broken the rules of this house. Minister. You may not address the public gallery. The house speaker leads the debates, not you, sir. Sent emails asking them to label things in Catalan, which is not a crime, it's a right and a law of the Catalan Government. But as the Catalan Government doesn't apply it, decided to send those mails so they would at least answer me.
