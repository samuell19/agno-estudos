Let's go over to The Playpad. Barry, I told you, I'm not in the mood. You weren't in the mood last night and I was able to change your mind. [Cynthia] Barry, I'm not in the mood. Okay, now what's your excuse? You're not gonna tell me you got herpes. It's a joke! Hey, hey, hey. It's a joke. It's a joke going around. You know what I mean, a joke. Herpes, herpes, going around? Cynthia, what's happened to your sense of humor? Barry, I really do have a headache and I'd just rather not. Oh, one of those not tonight routines, huh? Well, the cure for that, my darling, is put your mind elsewhere. Barry, stop it, please. [Barry] Now, don't tell me your old boyfriend's back in town? I'll tell you what, we'll have a menage a trois. How about that, the three of us, huh? What do you think? Barry, please, you're hurting me, stop it! Stop it, you're hurting me! Headache, my ass. Pull up 50 feet then come back and watch the place and see if she comes out again. Good evening, Miss Oberman. (Gasping) Vincent, you startled me! I beg your pardon, I didn't mean to. (ominous music) Your lift, Miss Oberman. Thank you, Vincent. Goodnight. Goodnight, Miss. (telephone buzzing) Yes? [Woman] Vincent? Yes, Mrs. Hornaday. [Mrs. Hornaday] I have been ringing forever! Vincent, do you hear me? Yes, ma'am. Please excuse the delay. Well, it's alright. I know how busy you get at times. Um, Vincent, I, um, I have some lovely Black Forest cake that I made. I'll save you a piece if you like. - Thank you, no, Mrs. - Hornaday, I do not care for any. Oh! At 11:30 on PBS there is a repeat of Nureyev doing Swan Lake. I thought you would enjoy that. - I'm sorry, Mrs. - Hornaday, you know it's impossible. One day. I'll save some cake for you just in case you change your mind. Goodnight, Vincent. (bird laughing) Ha, ha, ha, yourself. Some watch bird you are! What are you gonna do, laugh 'em to death? (disco music) ♪ Nightlife ♪ ♪ Nightlife ♪ ♪ Nightlife ♪ ♪ Nightlife ♪ ♪ Nightlife ♪ ♪ Nightlife ♪ ♪ Nightlife ♪ ♪ Nightlife ♪ (water splashing) (bird laughing) You better shut up or I'm gonna be arrested for molesting a myna. [Man On Recorder] Hey, princess, it's Dave. Listen, I'm staying at the St. Moritz. I'd like to see you tonight. Why don't you give me a holler when you get in? I'm warning you, I wanna get some sleep tonight. [Eleanor] Cynthia, it's Eleanor at the service. Listen, I just wanted to remind you about your appointment tomorrow night with Mr. Kline. He'll be by around midnight. Have fun, sweetheart. (recorder beeping) What's this? (dramatic music) (screaming) (bird squawking) [Mom] Hi, honey, it's Mom. Ugh, I hate talking into these machines. I want to thank you for your gift. We just got the check. We can't wait to see you at Thanksgiving. Daddy sends you his love. By the way, would you send me some more of your modeling pictures? Estelle says she's gonna put one up on the wall of the dry cleaning store. Call when you get a chance. I love you! She went up to her apartment. We can wait around here all night, but she's not coming out. Bitch. Alright, (sighs) I'll get my action somewhere else. Morning, Eddie. What's the matter with you? You look like you just lost your best friend. Oh, hey, I know what's eating you. It's 'cause Vincent gets all the attention, ain't it? The name is Edward and what's eating me, Mamie, if you must know, is that I am constantly cleaning up after someone else. Uh-huh, don't I know it. I hear you, brother. And if the tenants of this building wish to be charmed by a man who has a way with words and ignore those of us who are willing to roll up our sleeves and do the work, then I just give up. Uh-huh, I hear you, I can dig it. But what it is, Edward, my man, is your attitude. You are a sour-faced, down-in-the-mouth, low-life motherfucker! Excuse the expression. And you can take a tip or two from Vincent. He is refined and a gentleman with the ladies. Even if he is white. (traffic blaring) Miss Oberman, honey? It's me, Mamie. (disco music) Miss Oberman, honey? Constance? He ain't here and she ain't here. I guess it's just me and the mop. (radio chattering) (ominous music) Goodness, goodness! Oh, Lord. Look at this mess! (bird flapping) (screaming) You jive turkey! If you was my bird I'd tar your feathered ass! (bird squawking) Oh, the heck with this. (ominous music) (Mamie screaming) (camera clicking) [Alex] Mm-hmm, Frank. [Jack] Cynthia, please talk to me. I have to see you just once more. Look, I'll be home all night. Is that who I think it is? [Jack] Please! Damn, Alex! You want me to take care of it? [Alex] No, Jack was my partner, I'll do it. And I know just where to find him. Hey, listen, I found this in her coat pocket. [Alex] Playpad? Check it out, see if there's a connection. Playpad. Hey look, I might be a little late tomorrow. All in the line of duty, of course. (bird laughing) Then take this bird to the pound, I'll be downstairs. [Edward] All visitors must be announced to the tenants. It's the policy of the building. Are they on duty 24 hours? [Edward] Yes, sir, there's someone on all the time. Day and night. What do you do when you have to take a leak? Excuse me? Take a leak? Well, we lock the door and put up a sign. What, that you're going to take a leak? No, sir, that we'll be right back. Oh. Who has keys to the building? All the tenants have keys. They can let themselves in through the front or the rear entrance. Who was on duty last night? Vincent, sir. Vincent Hardwick. Where can I find this Vincent guy? 814 Clairmont Avenue. But you would be wasting your time with him. Oh, why is that? Because Vincent is a gentleman. Everyone in this building loves Vincent. - I like this. - Yes, sir. Edward, tell me, just between you and me. What kind of people live in this building? (laughs) Well, we have quite a variety here. But a superficial lot at best. How's that? We have these artists and professional people. [Alex] Professionals, huh? Like Cynthia Oberman, that kind of professional? Exactly and worse. (traffic blaring) (soft jazz music) [Alex] Hi Jack. Alex, my buddy! Sit down! Sit down. My God. Jack, where were you last night? Home. Nursing a friend. Alone? Did you go out? I was blind out of my mind. I don't remember anything. When was the last time you saw Cynthia? Not for months. Since I was bounced from the job she didn't want to have anything to do with me. I couldn't get her the things she wanted. I didn't have the extra money, couldn't get any drugs. What good is a man if he can't get a woman the things that she needs? You gave her all you had, Jack. And then some that wasn't yours to give. Jack... Oh, Alex. How I love her. Cynthia's dead, Jack, she was murdered last night. No. No. No. Oh, my God, no. No! (Sobbing) Come on. Take it easy buddy, come on. I know how much she meant to you. (Jack sobbing) Jack, I'm gonna find the guy that did it. That's a promise. (classical music) Other women cloy the appetites they feed. But she makes hungry where most she satisfies. Age cannot wither her. Nor custom stale her infinite variety. How beautiful you were as Cleopatra. Close your eyes, Mother. Happy birthday, Mother! Happy birthday to you. There's no need to thank me. The fun is in the doing. Aren't you gonna blow your candles out? At least make a wish. (blowing) Now your wish will come true. (laughs) Don't tell me. Don't tell me. I was only joking. It looks good, doesn't it? Doesn't it look delicious, shall we? Should we cut it and have a piece? Here's for you. And here's for me. Oh! Mmm! Delicious! Is there any little toast you'd like to propose, Mother? Let me, let me. Something apropos, hmm? No? Oh, well. Excellent bordeaux, excellent indeed. (laughs) (doorbell ringing) Unexpected guest, huh? I invited no one else. (sinister music) [Alex] Mr. Hardwick? [Vincent] Yes. [Alex] Lieutenant Dinardo, police. [Vincent] Is there something wrong? [Alex] I'd like to ask you a few questions. - You mind? - No, no, my time is yours. This way. Mother and I were just celebrating her birthday. Oh, Mother, this is Lieutenant Dinardo, he's a policeman. How do you do, ma'am? Won't you have a seat, Lieutenant? We were just about to have some cake. No, thanks. Mr. Hardwick, could we? Oh, of course. And, um, please call me Vincent. Mother had an unfortunate accident many years ago. I'm sorry. Oh, don't be, Lieutenant. As Shakespeare wrote, affliction may one day smile again. Until then, simply down sorrow. Did he now? You work the late shift at The Royal Arms, Vincent? As the sun rises I take my leave. Do you know Cynthia Oberman? Yes. Did you see her last night? Yes, I believe I did, just before midnight. Was she alone? A limousine dropped her off but she came in alone. (coughs) Did you speak to her? No. Well, yes, but just to say goodnight. She came into the building and went directly up in the lift. Do you know who was in the limousine? No, I don't. Did Miss Oberman have any callers after she came home? Not to my knowledge. Did you hear or see anything out of the ordinary? No, sir. Well, I guess that's about all for now. Thank you. I trust Miss Oberman is not in any trouble, sir? No, she's not in trouble, Vincent. She's dead. (ominous music) Poor thing. You say it in such short speech. Well, that's the way dead is, Vincent; short. I'll see myself out. Afternoon, ma'am. Good day, Lieutenant. (tragic music) (sighing) I am shapen from the fount whence honor springs. And therefore doomed to sin. Yeah, Frank? Got anyone at The Playpad? She did, huh? Same guy? You got a name? Yeah, wait a minute, Barry, Barry what, Moyer? Address? That's fancy. Very fancy. I'll drop by there now and check him out. Lieutenant Dinardo, I want to see Barry Moyer. Penthouse, sir. (elevator dinging) (doorbell buzzing) Moyer, anybody home? Moyer? (man groaning) (gasping) (grunting) (screaming) Hey, Moyer. You there? (Grunting) Moyer? (screaming) Who is it? Lieutenant Dinardo, I found you, remember? Huh, oh. What happened last night after you dropped off Cynthia Oberman? Cynthia, that bitch, we had a date. Cynthia's dead, Moyer. She was murdered. Huh? Oh, God. Oh, God. Lyman, the crazy bastard. Who's Lyman? He's my driver. He's crazy. He's crazy, he tried to, he tried to, he tried to kill me. Kill you, why? Why? He’s jealous! He’s jealous of me! Of Cynthia? Ask him! Where can I find him? Portal Palaces on Broadway, get him! (slapping) (screaming) [Alex] Thanks, pal. Don't catch cold, now. Pig! Vincent? Vincent? (sighing) Vincent? Yes, Mrs. Hornaday? Honestly, I don't know where you go at times. And with what's happening in this building I need to know that you're close by. Vincent, my plans have changed. I'm going to spend the evening at home, alone. [Vincent] Yes, ma'am. Oh, and Vincent, I found some lovely passages from Elizabeth Browning. I can make some coffee and we could read them together. Ah, but then I would be leaving the lobby unprotected, Mrs. Hornaday. Oh, no, don't do that. Vincent? Are you there? Lyman Nelson, alias, Jay Nelson, alias Lefty Harris. I love reading the dossier on these gentlemen. Two counts for attempted rape, male prostitution, child molestation, assault with a deadly weapon, and he's out on the streets. Looks like this Moyer picked himself one loo-loo of a chauffeur. Yeah, and a chain smoker to boot. What do you mean? They were strange bedfellows. Moyer's butt looked like an ashtray at a Lucky Strike convention. Almost makes you want to give these things up. You think Lyman knocked off Cynthia Oberman, too? We won't know that until you find him. I'm on it, Alex. I'm on it. (traffic blaring) (door slamming) (gasping) (breathing heavily) (locks clicking) (dramatic music) (screaming) Two drafts, fellas. Now, would you like to shake up for it, huh? Sure, gimme the cup. Be my guest. Go ahead, your luck is rotten anyway. (laughs) Three fours, I told you your luck was rotten. Now fella, you just watch an expert, huh? Here we go! Hey, you crazy? In or out, but close the door! I told you, rotten! (Laughs) Now pay up! What'll it be? Wine picon. A what? Hey look, straight shots are a buck and a quarter, or mix the two, huh? You can't make a wine picon? Listen pal, this is not Park Avenue. (guys laughing) Go ahead and laugh, you guys. All the nuts are in here today including the picon man. You sir, are a vulgar, feverish little clod. What did you call me? You crazy shithead! (choking) Get him off! Get him off me! (Patron grunting) [Patron] Get outta here! Get the fuck, get out! [Bartender] Get him off me! [Patron] Get out! [Bartender] Get that bum outta here! Get out! Please! Please, leave me alone. (knocking) It's open. You're beautiful. Close it. You can knock off the Bowery shuffle, huh? What'd you find out? Not much. He went drinking at McGinty's bar. McGinty's? What's he doing in a dive like that? I don't know. For some reason he was trying to get into a fight, looking to get himself hurt. He got thrown out and went home. Thrown out, for what? Fighting over you. Yeah. He fell at my feet, literally. So anything new break? No, nobody saw anything, nobody heard anything. You still want me to stay on Hardwick? Yeah, anybody that cuts a cake with a butcher knife interests me. (telephone ringing) Dinardo, Homicide. What? Yeah. Oh Jesus, yeah I'll be right there! What is it? [Alex] Another one at The Royal Arms. This one's in pieces! You want me to go along? Not the way you're dressed. Meet me at the morgue in 30 minutes. Alex, wait! My clothes are in your... Oh, damn it! (coins jingling) Keep up the good work, kid. [Alex] Got a real sickie on our hands this time, Frank. So, what's the game plan? [Alex] I want a 24 hour watch on all entrances. Alex, you're talking about three men. That's not even counting the man on the roof. The captain is not gonna go for it. Be forceful, Frank, use your charm. [Dr. Richards] What are you doing? Come on, fellas, we're running late, let's go. [Alex] Doc. Lieutenant. Come on, come on. (clattering) Hey, that's not a sack of potatoes, you know. Time to go to work. Am I late? No, you’re just in time. Next of kin? It's Sergeant Kate Bridges, special detail, Doc. Why didn't you change your clothes? I was gonna take you to lunch. You still can if you give me the key to your locker. (body bag unzipping) Away we go. I'd say she was murdered in the evening. Toes are still supple. She must have been wearing socks. Ah-ha, there it is. Let's see. The leg goes here, arm goes here. And the head goes (thudding) here. - Alex, about lunch... - I know, forget it. What's the matter with her? Doesn't she like a good puzzle? Look, Doc, can you just tell us what kind of weapon was used? What do you want me to do, take this seriously? I'll make myself depressed. As far as I can determine it's probably a scalpel or a razor blade. And then a large carving knife or a butcher knife. Of course, you can't rule out a meat cleaver. Oh, Lieutenant? I forgot, call your office, they got something for you. (traffic blaring) (police radio chattering) Pull up in front. Come on now, they're here for you today. Beautiful ladies, beautiful ladies, here to show you the world! Hey, come on, mister, beautiful girls, no clothes, just the way you like 'em! We got a couple young college chicks inside, real nasty! (laughs) Let's go, the greatest show in town, let's go! I see you got my message! Yeah, I got it. You behavin'? Clean, man, clean! It's the cleanest show in town! Looks to me like you could stand a toss. You know what you down here for! I'm all ears. We got brunettes and redheads and bleach blondes! Look like they just came out the wash! And the laundry man is close at hand! Lyman? Right inside, sir, right inside, sir! Beautiful ladies, all young, all new! [Alex] For how long? Started a half hour ago! Show started one half hour and you right on time! And here it is the show you've been waiting for. It's on the streets. [Alex] Lyman? Police. No covers, no minimum! (dramatic music) (siren blaring) (tires screeching) [Kate] Great, just great. (suspenseful music) Hold it right there, Lyman! (cans clattering) (siren blaring) (tires screeching) Freeze or I'll blow your ass away! Not bad. Couldn't have done better myself. (clattering) (thudding) (punching) (knife clicking) (punching) (thudding) (metal clanging) Alex? Alex? Did you blow his ass away? Jesus Christ, kid! If you're gonna pull that gun have the guts to use it! Otherwise, leave the rough stuff to me. (handcuff clinking) Comfortable, Lyman? Yeah. Enjoy it while you can. You're gonna be doing some cold, hard time. You mind if I have a little coffee? No, sure, go right ahead. Thanks. Tell me, Lyman, just out of curiosity, did you get off killing those two women and burning holes in that guy? You know, you're the one that keeps talking about that, maybe your pants are wet, huh? (chuckles) (thudding) Trouble, Alex? No trouble, he just tripped over his mouth. Lock him up. (crowd chattering) (soft piano music) Sydney. Sydney, my dear, it's been too long. Listen, wait until you see the new collection. It will absolutely knock your eyes out. I need something sophisticated, rich, trendy. You know what I mean? I know exactly what you mean. I've told you for years you could make money in my clothes. Did you see the spread I got in the Times and in WW? No, I missed it, I'm afraid. Oh, Sydney, I've told you, you should do more serious reading. Excuse me, we'll be starting in a moment. I'll just go and see what they're up to in the back. If you can't get it up in half an hour, you're gonna have to get out. (women laughing) Alright, everybody, alright, final check up. Rachel, my dear, drinking again, I see. Louise, I want those eyes darker, much darker. And princess Nadine is here at last. How good of you to honor us with your presence. Phyllis, I want you to wear the red matte jersey. Nadine can wear the blue cocktail dress. Every single pound shows in that outfit. Alright, ladies, I've got half a million dollars in heavy action out there, so let's not fuck it up. She's in rare form today. Louise wears a shimmering waterfall of silver beads and pearls on a white crepe deco gown. Graceful wings of silver bugle beads adorn this 1920s white silk summer's dress worn by Rachel. This would be perfect for your theater, Mr. Mark. Phyllis is wearing a backless red matte jersey evening gown. The waist cinched and trimmed in a deco bugle beaded motif. Now, here's Nadine in a blue crepe, spaghetti strapped cocktail dress, provocatively slit up the left hip. Graziella, I'd like to see Nadine. I'd like a closer look. Oh, Nadine. Alice sports a dolman sleeved deco cocktail dress. Liz is in a silver bugle beaded dress. You've been avoiding me. Why, Mr. Blume. Yes, you have. Are you busy later? Maybe. I give you girls nice presents. I always give you nice presents. Yes, I know, Sydney. You write with a big pencil. You better believe it. So... Do we have a date? I'll be by. Bye bye. - [Edward] Pity about Mrs. - Hornaday, isn't it? Yes. I just put her mail over there on the side. You liked her, didn't you, Vincent? She was a cultured lady. Well, I'm off to the theater. Too bad you don't get to the theater anymore. (door opening) Vincent. (Dog barking) Eddie, don't you get enough of this place? I have to take Rose to the park. I'm expecting a friend, a Miss Pepper. Have her make herself comfortable. Thanks, kid. Pig. Well, I'm off, I have people waiting for me. (traffic blaring) [Nadine] Keep the change. Good evening, Miss Pepper. Hiya, Vincent, how's it hangin'? Any new stiffs tonight? [Vincent] I beg your pardon, Miss? Sorry, Mr. Blume is expecting me. Mr. Blume had to step out for a moment, but he left his key and said for you to make yourself at home. I always do. There you are, Miss. If I'm not in the apartment tell him I'll be in the sauna. Oh, yes, Miss Pepper. (tender music) You've been busy, have you? Busy? (Chuckles) I've been in and out of so many clothes I feel like a 10 cent coat hanger. You know what I mean? No, I guess you don't, do you, honey? Death, that has taken her hence to make me wail, ties up my tongue and will not let me speak. What? Shakespeare. You sure know how to turn a girl's head. (moaning) (tense music) (water bubbling loudly) (muffled screaming) (splashing) [Nadine] Sydney, you dumb jerk! Christ! You almost broke my back, oh! You're lucky I didn't break your neck! What are you doing sneaking up on me like that? Hey, it was just a joke. I don't see you laughing! My ex-wife used to throw me out of the house, but no one's ever thrown me out of my slippers. (both laughing) Go get some heat on your back and I'll give you a real throw when you come out. Please, no more surprises, huh? Not even Louise? Louise? - Oh, Louise! - She's coming over tonight and she's in a mood. Go, hurry, get ready! We'll start without you! Go you sexy devil, go! Hey, sweet Jesus, Christmas in October! Oh! (sighing) Sydney, baby, for a man in the clothing business you are one hell of a slob. Well, what are you gonna be tonight, Sydney? A judge? A cop? A slave. Oh, God. (ominous music) Nadine, is that you, honey? Hey, come on, don't fool around. (doorbell ringing) Just a minute, Louise, I'm coming! Just a minute, Louise, I'm coming! (doorbell ringing) Hold your horses! Hold your horses! Alright, already. Louise? (screaming) (banging) Help me, please! For God's sake, help me! (dramatic music) (elevator clunking) Oh, come on. Don't stop now! Come on! Come on! (suspenseful music) (children shouting) (Louise gasping) (man yelling) Aren't you kind of old for that, honey? (ominous music) (Louise screaming) [Alex] Curious, isn't it, Vincent? Four murders and they all happened on your shift. Night breeds mischief, Lieutenant. Shakespeare again? No, Hardwick. Tell me, Hardwick, you live in that big, fancy house. You and your mother seem to have plenty of money. Why do you work as a doorman? Well, like you, Lieutenant, I wish to be a servant to the people. Life may bring disappointments, but work is a consolation, Proust. Cut out the cryptic bullshit, Hardwick, and give me some straight answers! Now what were you doing up on the ninth floor? I received a call that a young, partially clothed woman was causing a disturbance. You're talking about Nadine Pepper? Yes, but she'd already gone when I got there. And what about this guy, Blume? He was lying in the hallway, also partially clothed. What do you know about him? Just that he has many acquaintances. The live-in kind? Transients. Who, uh... Who called in with the complaint? Mrs. Tolbert, ninth floor, she'll verify what I told you. She a friend of yours? I have no friends, Lieutenant. I take my solace in my books. You do, do you? Now you listen to me, Hardwick. If I tie you to any of this, and I'm about one knot away, you'll be checking your next book out of a prison library! Now, see if you can get any solace from that! Frank! Frank? Yes, sir. Yes, I'll tell him. Excuse me. Frank, what the hell happened? That was Helms on the phone. You really roughed Lyman up. He's screaming whiplash and Helms is screaming for your ass. Yeah, yeah, I know. But what happened? I thought you had men on all the entrances. Helms said two men was all he could spare. Besides, we already had Lyman in custody. That means we gave that asshole an alibi. What about the doorman, you wanna hold him? On what? See that he gets home. (light music) She always beat me at hopscotch, Marian Johnson. She was just one of those girls. Her feet never bounced out of the line. She never fell over. (Laughs) I still can't do it. Alex, you're not listening to me. Alex? I know, I know, sorry. I don't suppose you wanna tell me what you're thinking about? It's not hopscotch. [Kate] I didn't think so. I'm not gonna be able to crack this from the outside. I just can't wait around for another body to show up. Know what I mean? I know what you mean. When you were a kid, Alex, what'd you want to be when you grew up? I wanted to be a cop. Why, what'd you wanna be? I wanted to be one of those girls in the circus that swings from a rope and wears red sequins. They're just there to distract the audience while the animal act gets set up, but I always thought they were important. You are important, Kate. You want me to go in, don't you, decoy for you? I didn't say that. You can't say it, Alex. They wouldn't like it uptown. That's what you want, isn't it? You know why I wanted to be a cop? 'Cause I was scared of a lot of things and I knew cops were never scared. Shows you how much I knew. I'll do it, Alex. You don't have to. I'll do it. You sure? I'm gonna move you into Cynthia Oberman's apartment as her cousin. You've come to live there to take care of things. I'll have Mike and Frank down the hall in a stakeout apartment. You'll be well covered, but you've got to be careful. You're a target, you're vulnerable. You've gotta stay on top of everything. (Kate laughs) What, what's so funny? For somebody who was afraid to ask you sure are well prepared. Another woman has been murdered in the building, Mother. It's here, here in the paper. I was talking to Miss Pepper only recently. (laughs) She thought I was amusing, imagine that? Where lies her laughter now, eh? Well, the descent to Hades is the same from everyplace. (chuckling) (crying) (traffic blaring) (ominous music) (dryer buzzing) Miss. Don't shoot, it's me! Jesus, Mike! I almost blew your brains all over my clean sheets. I was just trying to show you around the job. Where's Frank? Upstairs, down the hall from you. Wait a sec, Kate. Let's check this. Okay, it's safe, go on up. Sleep tight. Thanks. (elevator clunking) (ominous music) Forgive me. I took the liberty. You must be Miss Brady, yes? Yes. Welcome to The Royal Arms. I'm Vincent, the doorman. Thank you, Vincent. They're lovely. So too, is the morning mist and the sweet breath of babes. I'm so sorry about your cousin. Goodnight, Miss. So too, is the morning mist and the sweet breath of babes. By the way, Frank, Vincent gave me flowers. I never get flowers from you guys. [Mike] How's Kate doing? Vincent gave her flowers. Hope they weren't daisies. You've got a morbid sense of humor. (traffic blaring) Your shoes are scruffy. They need a polish. Aren't you needed at home? Vincent? Good morning. I was wondering... Allow me, Miss. The night man is off duty. Could you store that for me? Well, of course, we can store it for you. Can't we, Vincent? You could have rung. I would have come gladly. That's alright, Vincent. You're up early, Miss. This is my favorite part of the day. Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it? I love to watch the city come to life. It's rather like the quickening of one’s pulse. Wouldn't you say? (laughs) Yes, I suppose so. Um, Vincent, if you’re off now I'd love to return your kindness for the flowers and buy you a cup of coffee. Beg your pardon, Miss? Coffee, do you have time for a cup? That would be very nice, but I have to go straight home. Mother's alone and not in good health. I'm sorry. Well, maybe another time. (tense music) Alex, Frank, he's coming right at you. He's all yours. [Frank] We're on him. See you back at the apartment. Alex? Hey Alex, how long are we gonna have to sit here? [Alex] Till he makes a move. For two days now, he works, goes home, takes his mother to the park, goes to bed. You can't keep this from the captain forever. Well, that's my problem, we'll stay on it. Sure would be nice to get inside there, take a look around. Why don't we get a warrant? Mm, good idea. I'm sure glad you thought of it. (Frank chuckles) The judge is a friend of mine. Alex! Come on, we got 15 minutes. What, you got this guy on a timer or something? Kate does. (dramatic music) A day as fine as this, all of nature wears one universal grin. Shall we go by our favorite place, Mother? (children chattering) Miss Brady? Vincent! Vincent. Oh, what pleasant surprise. This is my mother. We've been enjoying the park this morning. Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Hardwick. Won't you sit down? Oh, thank you I will. I just have to stretch out a little first. Excuse me. (Sighing) I heard you weren't feeling well. It's good to see you out and about. Mother can't speak, but she understands what you say. Well, it certainly is a beautiful day, isn't it? Yes, it's beautiful. Do you visit the park often? No, not really. No, I didn't think so. It's the first time I've seen you here. And I would have noticed you, to be sure. Hmm, Chateau Latour '76. Bag this for the lab, will you? (ducks quacking) These are also good from a sitting position. Mother can only move her fingers. She relies on me to get her about. But she's quite content to watch and listen. Aren't you, Mother? Mother and I have a special way of communicating. We understand each other perfectly. Miss Brady lives at The Royal Arms, Mother. She's our newest tenant. [Frank] Nothing! Hey Alex, eight and a half minutes and counting. [Vincent] May I ask you a question? Of course. [Vincent] Why isn't an attractive woman like yourself married? Vincent! Please, don't misunderstand me! It's just that a woman's time of opportunity is short and if she doesn't seize it, nobody wants her. Is that so? I'm afraid it is, Miss Brady. And a woman alone, well... What about a man, Vincent? You're an attractive man. Have you ever been married? Sorry, go on. What were you saying about a woman alone? Just an idle thought. But I digress and Mother's getting impatient. We'd best be going. Thoughts aren't idle with me, Vincent. I'm often alone. That's unfortunate. Good day, Miss Brady. Theatrical makeup. Yeah, our doorman was an actor. [Frank] Hey, Alex, I think we're wasting our time. Hey, Frank, listen to this. Two members of the Cumberland Repertory Group were injured when their car went off the road near Route 132. Marion Hardwick, who suffered massive injuries, expected to live, though she may be permanently injured. Her son, Vincent, who was driving, sustained minor cuts but is suffering from shock. Both were appearing in a local production of The Importance of Being Earnest at the state theater. Hey, Alex, it's getting real late. (dramatic music) Back way, let's go! (door slamming) Oh, poor Vincent. No wonder he's so screwed up. Now don't feel too sorry for him. 10 to one poor Vincent's already killed four people, that's not counting putting his old lady in a wheelchair. Alex, you know, sometimes you are a real cold son of a bitch. I'm sorry. I don't get paid to sympathize and neither do you, Kate. It's not sympathy, Alex, it's called being human. Human? That kind of talk really pisses me off. I don't feel sorry for anybody that's killed four people. In my book, you kill one person, you're not human. And don't give me any of that insanity crap. You kill, you pay! Okay, okay, I give up. I didn't kill anyone. Well, you ought to know better. Funny, I think you ought to know better. Oh, here we go again. At least you didn't accuse me this time of being a soft-hearted woman. You'll never let me live it down, will you? One time I said it, just once, by accident, and you'll never forget it. Just like a woman. (Kate groaning) Just like a woman. For the lady, linguine, white clam sauce. And for you, Senor Dinardo, calamari a la Guido. Bene, bene! Uh, red pepper, Pino. Sure, Senor Dinardo, of course. Everything justo, justo? Everything's wonderful, Pino. (speaking foreign language) Doesn't that stuff make you sweat? Oh, me, Mr. Macho? My mother used to put it in my formula. (chuckles) Thank you, Vincent. God, it's cold outside. Yes, Miss. Vincent, anything wrong? Sometimes the weight of a man's guilt is too heavy a cross. I beg your pardon? Goodnight, ma'am, Miss. I know it's none of my business, but if you ever need someone to talk to, I'm willing to listen. [Alex] Hi Steve, what do you got for me? Nothing much at all. I just finished with the butcher knife. It's clean, Alex, there are no traces of blood. I don't think it's your murder weapon. - Shit! - Back to square one. You might be interested in this, however. It just came over from the coroner's office. Yeah, what's that? The report on your last two victims. They found makeup on one of the bodies. So what? Nadine Pepper was a model, model's wear makeup. No, not on her, Alex, on him. - On Blume? - Uh-huh. The coroner found several smudges of makeup on his neck, just above the shoulders. He could have gotten it from Nadine, though, couldn't he? They don't match. Blume was attacked in the sauna. It may be the killer's makeup brand. Steve, did you run an analysis? Yep, I got it right here. Medicated beige base, in plain English, theatrical makeup. Hardwick, son of a bitch! (telephone ringing) No answer, damn it! Hi guys, I'm home! The linguine was justo, justo! But I think I gained 10 pounds, yuck. Better call Mike and tell him to pick Hardwick up. (busy signal beeping) Busy! Steve, keep calling this number. Tell Mike Hardwick's our guy, let's go! I'm gonna be doing my exercises now so you won't be hearing from me for a while. And don't come in, my dance card is full. (siren blaring) (disco music) (ominous music) Hey guys, my lights went out. (ominous music) (clattering) Ow, for Christ's sake! Where the hell is the fuse box? (grunting) Mike, Frank, I got him, I got him! Mike, Frank! (dramatic music) (screaming) (tires screeching) It's stuck on Kate's floor! (screaming) (panting) (crying) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (thudding) (frantic music) (thudding) - Kate! - Oh, Alex! Yeah, make sure you call the coroner and have backup meet us there, right! Now you stay and wrap up things here, Frank. - We're going after Hardwick. - Careful! Mother, quickly, we must leave! (siren blaring) There stands the inspector at thy door. Like a dog he hunts for boys who know not two and two are four! Oh, how I wish the innocence of youth could return. But for me, all memory is pain. And you, you Mother, are to blame! Oh, Shakespeare knew you, how! How he knew you, how he did! The expense of spirit and a waste of shame. His lusts and action until action always murdered, perjured, bloody! Full of blame! (Vincent crying) (siren blaring) (tires screeching) (dramatic music) Hardwick, police! Vincent? (suspenseful music) Vincent? (dramatic music) (thudding) Alex? (ominous music) (screaming) (thudding) (frantic music) (clattering) (screaming) Edward? Yes, Edward. I don't understand. It's all in here, in his diary. We all acted together on the stage at the Cumberland Repertory Theater in England. Vincent was brilliant. And beautiful. (clattering) His mother tried to break us up. She was taking him away from me. And, uh, that's when the accident happened? It was no accident. Vincent was trying to kill himself because he didn't want to leave me. But it was his mother who wound up paralyzed. That was our chance to be together. But Vincent was guilt-ridden. He would never leave his mother after that. So you followed him to New York? It took me four years to find him. And then three months ago I finally got a job at The Royal Arms, just to be near him. I knew he still loved me. But he had to be freed. But even after I killed his mother he rejected me. Then, when I brought her back to life he still rejected me. So I... Fool! How I hated all of them. All of, uh, all of who? (Kate gasping) The women, of course, and all the tenants, each trying to take his attention away from me just like his mother did. But I fixed them. And now you. (Kate whimpering) (thudding) (knife clattering) (dramatic music) (thudding) (gun firing) Alex. Oh, my God! Alex, are you alright? Yeah, did I get him? Couldn't have done it better myself.
