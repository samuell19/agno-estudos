That fucking janitor keeps smiling at me, with his creepy nasty face. He smacked my ass while I was washing my hands. No one believes me, except Sonia and Miss Craig. Everyone else says he's a good person, and I'm just a delusional little bitch. What the hell am I still doing here? All doors and windows locked, goodnight Angela. I skipped school again today. That bitch is always making fun of me in front of the zombies. I don't know why she hates me so much. I never did anything to her or her dumb boyfriend.

But there was one story that I never got to the bottom of; a truth that remained untold. The Annie Red case; I believe it to be no accident, but I need evidence. This brings me to why I contacted you... Having been a close friend ofAnnie's mother, Angela, I believe you are in a unique position to help. You see, I have reason to believe Angela has been withholding vital information about the case. Already, I myself have often tried to contact Angela, to no avail... perhaps you can succeed where I failed I just want to get justice for that little girl, is that really so much to ask? Already a sum, double your standard fee, has been lodged in your account. I trust you won't speak of this investigation to anyone. And please don't try to contact me, just send me a message and I'll get back to you. Thank you. Hi, Angela This is a public service announcement. It is vital that all citizens remain vigilant.

Fine... I'm actually moving house. You willing to move far from here? Yeah, I thought I'd go back into town. Well, I think it's time I did a lot of things I put off. I thought your dream was to have an house surrounded by trees and greenery Yes it was, things change I guess So how is your love life? Michael, you mean? It's over I'm sorry about that. No it's fine, it's for the better; So what are doing for work? Well, it's quite a big change, it's a bit crazy actually Really? Yeah, could be working for a detective agency Oh, is it interesting? Yeah, it's something I always wanted to do. I just took a weapon's licensing class. Wow... That's the door on the first floor, it always slams when you don't close it well I... I ain't ever seen a Wolf Infection like this before. I mean, you need to clean the gangrene... and... Sorry... (Cough) and you need to remove the pus from these wounds... You see? Like t.. this.. Like that So sorry... I really didn't mean to offend you madam... please accept my sincerest apologies grandmother... Please forgive me (Cough cough) Oh shit... Can I ask you a favour? Sure I mean, It's very hard for me at the moment again. Something is happening Is it serious? I think so, I'm not sure if it's a man or a woman... someone is stalking me. What? Did you call the police? No, not yet Well I think you should To be honest, I went to the police station, but the policemen didn't seem to take it too seriously Why? They said they need some concrete evidence, and they think I don't have any You know the one who is stalking me is very careful not to leave any traces, no phone calls, no messages It started some time ago, at first he makes me find animal corpses in the front garden Mice... cats ...even a little lamb What did the police say? They said those animals could have naturally died in the garden. I guess they think I put them there on my own. All the corpses were lying in the same place. Their legs facing the entrance of the house Yesterday it got into the house... took one of my daughter's dolls. Do you remember my daughter, Annie? Yes of course... Do you think I'm crazy? No I do... I think I'm driving myself crazy... I'd like you to help me understand what is happening... Ok Look, I'm already moving, so how about I come here for the night? You know, just stay for one night, it might help you feel a bit more protected. Okay, thank you The wolf... the wolf's existence reminds us how lucky we are to still be human. But with each breath, the wolf also reminds us that we have failed. We sacrifice our left hand, he sister who helped us to heal the infection. This sacrifice will fuel us with both pain and with ephemeral joy, preparing us for our battle against the unclean. Rejoice and suffer, son of my son. All doors and windows locked, goodnight Angela. That douchebag is even worse than her. Yesterday morning he pissed on my diary. I wish they would just die. Warning, the window upstairs is unlocked Warning, the window upstairs is unlocked When I woke up this morning I was lying on the floor, next to the window I woke up on the floor again today. This is the third time. Mom doesn't give a fuck. All she does is cry and overreact. I don't even know why I call her 'Mom' anymore. I'm starting to hate seeing my face in the mirror. Sometimes it looks like mom's fucking face, and I can't stand it. This house is a stinking pile of shit now. I was happy when Dad was here... WE were happy. Sorry if I skip the pleasantries but something has been on my mind since our conversation yesterday; just what was it that happened between you and Angela? I had an affair with a married man... He's name is Michael She judged me She thought I was immoral and cruel. So Angela left you? One of Michael's requests was to exclude Angela from my life. So you left her, I see. And why did you accept this job Diane? I just... I really wanna make things right She was going through the hardest thing she has ever been through, and I wasn't there for her. Well now is your chance. Thank you. The only decent people in this school are Sonia and Miss Craig. They are the only ones who talk to me. Sometimes they even make me feel like I'm normal. Access granted, faced recognized. Welcome home, guest Diane. Warning, the window upstairs is unlocked Warning, the window upstairs is unlocked Warning, the window upstairs is unlocked Warning, the window upsta.. Rejoice in your sacrifice, you half-innocent lamb: you who aided the unclean, you who brought joy to their rotten hearts. Because your pain will temporarily slake the Wolf's anger, because your pain will give our brothers power, because your pain will impair the Wolf. Rejoice in your sacrifice, because your pain is pure and holy. And they covered the bread with the Martyrs' Oil, to remind themselves that one cannot feed on happiness alone, just as the beast errs by feasting only on pain. Rejoice and suffer, son of my son. Good morning Hi, did you sleep well? Yes I think so, I needed to go upstairs to close the window When the wind is strong the door beats all night You're hungry, do you want something to eat? Yes, I'm starving Can I ask you something? Sure Why did you end your relationship with Michael? I discovered he had another relationship, a third one so I decided to leave him When I found out... I was forced to consider that what we had was not real. It wasn't real love, he was never gonna break up with his wife, It was just an excuse so he can have another lover You won't believe me Diane, but I'm really sorry No it's like you said, Michael was never mine. ...It was just an illusion But now I'm here, and I really wanna help you, ok? Let's just focus on this I don't want that you feel like you owe me, Diane... I was just giving you a hint, it's what friends use to do, isn't it? I don't feel like I owe you about your advice, about Michael... Annie you mean? I should have been here for you, but shame kept me away I'm gonna go shopping now the fridge is empty. Give me a couple of minutes, I'll come with you No, do you mind if you stay here? I don't want to leave the house empty. Ok, Sure You can put your stuff in Annie's room Fine I mean you can put your clothes in there, you can sleep in mine Ok thanks I got a phone call this evening from an old Italian woman. She's the leader of some religious group. She said I'm sick, and that's why I keep waking up in weird places and can't remember what happened. Dad had the same illness, but he was even sicker than me. She said he was dangerous, and that's why he left us: he didn't want to harm me or Mom. She said that this is an ancient illness and their group have been curing it for generations. She said they can help me, just like they helped my Dad. I've got so many questions to ask them about Dad. I did some research on them. Apparently, they don't have a "lettera" account because I couldn't find much on the web about them. They call themselves the Woodmen, and they are a religious cult. They used to find helpers on the web and they'd recruit homeless people. They stopped doing that after they got the support of Lumen Corp - yes, the famous one. After that, they just disappeared. Apparently, they own a few places here in London, like a couple of abandoned warehouses and a desecrated church. You bleeding bastards... You killed her... you killed her, I know you're here. I know you're here. Come out!!! I know you're here. I know you killed her I brought some food, you must be starving. I'm gonna put them in my jacket, right? And then, you take them out, right? You have to brush your teeth, right? If you don't, they'll rot. You've beautiful teeth. Ok My jacket is coming down, ok? You got it? I can bring you anything else you want, sweetheart, ok? I'll be back soon Where are you? I'm in Angela's house... to be exact in Annie's room. I got those pictures you sent me. Where did you find them? I was putting my clothes in the closet... and I found some really weird things that belonged to Annie The files are encrypted, I'll need time do convert them, but I did some research on the picture. Those people are part of a cult. Their leader is an 85 year-old woman they call the Grandmother. But it goes deeper, they've been financed by a company: Lumen corp. I want to tell Angela ...but.. I don't know if she knows or not. No, Don't do that... I know... I know there is a connection between Angela's stalkers and what happened to Annie Maybe, or maybe nobody is stalking Angela, maybe she is delusional. Do you really think someone broke in to Angela's house just to steal Annie's doll? I'm trying to not be influenced by suggestion... but I think that some really strange things happened to Annie. You are right to be wary, some of those people in the picture died this week, in a most brutal manner. Perhaps those involved in Annie's tragedy don't take kindly to witnesses... or maybe someone is out to avenge Annie... maybe it's Angela. Is that all Detective? Yes, just bring those papers to General Strainer... Hey!! HEY!! Go straight to the headquarters, ok? Don't stop for any reason Are you doing those fucking rituals again? I covered for you with that Annie Red thing, but I won't do that again. Listen... LISTEN!!! Maybe you haven't noticed yet: BUT WAR IS COMING!!! If they find out I was involved, it's a court martial for me... they don't waste time with trials anymore If I find another body in the streets, I'll come after you and I'll put a bullet in your fucking head. I know it's you, Don't fuck with me!!! This... this is an Interview I did with Detective Costa. Just listen to how he answered my questions Yes, you heard me, we can't find the girl's body. The pit is connected to an underground river. We believe she was dragged away by the current One more question, detective If you'll excuse me, we are extremely busy right now So you basically left her die!!!! Listen to me very carefully dickhead, I'm not obliged to answer your questions... I was gracious enough to tolerate your bullshit, this interview is fucking over... You see? You see now why I believe Annie's death was no accident! Hey Angela Hello Oh my God, what happened to you? I had a problem... Where have you been? I wanted go to the supermarket... a driver almost ran me over... I fell to the ground, but fortunately I'm ok You lost your jacket... Yes I know... Did you set your things in Annie's room? I put them on the couch. There wasn't enough room Yeah... I haven't used that closet in a while Angela, there are some things I found on there What kind of things? I think you should see with your own eyes Ok but not now. I need to take a shower, I'm disgusting. The things I took for granted are those that I miss most. I miss you calling me "Little Red". But I'm not sad, I'm pissed off... If there is a God, I would bash his fucking face in for what he has done to our family. Annie wrote that letter to her father I also found this... she must have been a member of some kind of cult... Did you know any of them? She stopped talking to me. She hated me. She was convinced that her father left because I couldn't hold him here. I guess it was easier for her to accept that it was my fault. She didn't really hate you, Angela You know, once she said to me that she knew she didn't mean anything to me. She said: "Mom, if you had to choose", you'll put me on the side of the road so it's easier for you to abandon me without any issue" My own daughter said that to me. She was manipulated by those people, probably the same people that are stalking you now Diane, the truth is right in front of you. It is exactly like you are seeing it What do you mean? I'm here. I cooked breakfast for you Come, sit, eat something To be honest, I'm not that hungry You're anxious to go to the police I bet... Of course, aren't you? We know how I feel about it... doesn't matter... at least drink this. Didn't you sleep at all last night? Maybe a couple of hours You need to relax before leaving No, I wanna resolve this now It will be a very long story, we will spend all day at the police station. What it's 6 now? Let's go at 7. Give yourself an hour of sleep Ok, but no more than an hour No, no more than one hour, you're so tired aren't you. Come, get some rest, you'll feel better soon. I'm sorry Annie, I'm back Mom is here... Mom is here Can you hear me? Can you hear me? I knew it was you, I knew it was you, I knew it was you, Mom is here Mom is here Diane You have to look at this ...Angela? Diane I don't feel well, I'm really thirsty, I need something to drink Do you feel better now? Not really. Angelaaa!!!! Look, you are not crazy, alright? Yes you've been stalked, and they want you to believe that Annie is still alive. We have got to go to the police Look at me You don't wanna help me What are you saying? Oh I see, you want a friend to be a shoulder to cry on. Well I'm sorry, I'm not just gonna be one of those fucking fake friends. Don't play Superwoman with me Diane What do you mean? I lost my head for my husband. I loved him, and then one day he looked at me in a strange way, a way I can't describe now. Look at me He smiled, and I said: "is everything ok?" and he said "Yeah, of course". In that exact moment, I knew. And you? What? That Michael was seeing another woman It took you a long time to recognize his real intentions. I guess you weren't that much in love with him. You have no right to say that to me You just wanted to feel the pleasure of stealing him from another woman. When the Wolf's blood contaminates the dead flesh of its victims, it will deceive us sinners with the illusion that the corpse is alive once more. It's still too strong This morning I found a letter from Dad He left in the box, next to mine That means he must've been here last night Diane as soon as you see this, leave town, build a new life. I fucked up bad... I fucked up pretty bad this time, I should never have stuck my nose in this mess. You threw her in that pit. You are blind to the truth. If by "throwing her into the pit" you mean performing the Abominatio ritual, then yes, we are indeed guilty. However, we did only what was necessary to eradicate the curse she inherited from her father. The ritual demanded that we must slice her flesh 33 times, contort her body with sacred ropes, anoint her with Saint Gervase's Oil, and finally toss her body into the holy pit. By completing the ritual, we have succeeded in halting the bloodline. Unfortunately, we failed to do the same for her father, 6 years ago. Those plagued by the Wolf's curse must become masters of mimicry, not least in the curse's final stages when it distorts their features. Before his victims died, they were each convinced that they were in the presence of a gentle soul. But that thing, he is not your friend. He is naught but a beast. He is Angela's husband and you are ensnared in his trap. You cannot begin to envisage what that monster is capable of. He displayed compassion and humanity only when he forsook Angela and her daughter so as to shield them from the threat he himself posed. He is avenging his daughter even though he is truly to blame for her demise. He slaughtered her classmates, for tormenting her. Then, Detective Costa: for conspiring to conceal our rituals. Your lover, Michael: for causing the rift between you and Angela. And of course you Diane, because you abandoned his wife when she needed you most. But don't worry, you will be bait for the Wolf. You should be honoured, because your sacrifice will help us to banish the beast for all eternity. Help me! He has stolen my beautiful robes... IT'S HERE!!!! Kill it!!! People will hunt you down just because they don't understand you. They will call you monster, and they will cut you to the bone, scarring you forever. Eventually you will start seeing a monster in the mirror, And you will hate that monster more than anyone or anything else. But even if you think there is nothing left in you to love, The echo of your first smiles will always remain Impressed in the hearts of those who loved you unconditionally me and your Mom. You will live in me Until the end of time.
