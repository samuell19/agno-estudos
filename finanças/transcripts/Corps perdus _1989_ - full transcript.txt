Are you getting out? ... Oh no, please, I'm nervous. ... No matter what happens to you, you always have me. Hm? Now... don't toil yourself. Not now, not here... I'll check if she's awake. Or if she's dead You're a monster! .... .... ..... Mother? Leave it! LEAVE IT! At last you came back, Laura. -What time is it? -It's night, mom. You should be sleeping. I don't want to sleep, Laura. I want to know who came with you. I'm lucky that I'm all alone. When my friends asked me about you, I didn't know what to say. But your friends don't come to visit you anymore. Enough, go to sleep. You have to sleep. I want to hear her. I'm not like you, Laura. I'm not fed up by my mother. My mother is alive here, with me. For me, you are alive too. .... .... What was that? Don't lie to me! There's nobody here, mother. .... Promise me, Laura. Laura, promise me one more thing. That when I'm dead. You will sell this house. Rest, mom. I'm Carlo Mangioli. How was your trip? Great, perfect, thanks. It's ten to two already. What do we do now? Go to a hotel? Are you tired? No no I'm not tired. I want to see the painting now. There's no hurry, we can go tomorrow, or later. -No, I would like to do it now, mister... -Carlos, call me Carlos. Carlos, OK, Carlos, I'd prefer to go now because I want to know if I want to do this or shall I go back to Paris tomorrow morning. It's okay, let's go. They only told me your name. The last crazy one who knows everything about Bax's work That's what they told you, yes? No, they didn't mention "crazy". They didn't tell me everything. But everybody told me that no one knows more about Bax than you. I don't know everything. How much could it be worth? If it's authentic, a lot. And what do you think? It would be absurd if the family of Leticia Fieux presented me with a fake Bax. It would be absurd and pitiful. The painting is in my wife's possession, she's granddaughter of Leticia. Of course, we have our needs and obligations. And plans also. A painting could be worth much or nothing, it depends. For Bax it was of much importance, he wrote it in a letter to a friend in Paris and he painted Leticia. No, there is no woman in the painting. It's not exactly a portrait It must be interesting to live here. Nobody lives here anymore. It's a pity. What a romantic you are! The painting is in this room. .... .... .... .... It's also here. Yes, it seems so. But these doors are not in the room -Excuse me? -The door. Yes, indeed. .... .... -There was some repainting done. -Maybe, I don't know. When I first saw it, Leticia was no longer there. Look at the signature. -Bax? -It's obviously Bax. No mistake. Bax. - Why hesitate? - Let's suppose it's Bax -I thought that you'd buy the picture yourself. -Why? I don't know... maybe 'cause of its value? Yet, I have my doubts. Leticia is not in the picture And the signature... it's not enough. I would like to examine the painting. Can I take it with me? -To the hotel? -No, the museum, with professional equipment. .... .... - Good evening. I'm Laura Canetti. Can you leave us for a moment? Of course Miss Canetti.. -Excuse me, I was examining the painting. -If you want, we can talk French. -Yes, please. It's not worth much, am I right? You're an expert, right? You should know how much you could earn. I don't know yet. This canvas needs some work. It would be great if the painting were worth so much, so much, you could say, Miss Canetti, you've earned a million. .... But... why does one need a million? Who doesn't want a million? I'll explain it to you. Want a cigarette? You heard I am an architect, right? I've a project. I'd like to transform my house, which I inherited. You know it. Into a gym, ultra modern, very expensive. Thank you. Well, the matter is in progress. Carlos handles the advertising, but we need a little push. And this is what I expect to get from the painting, which means, from you. I'll use all my power to satisfy you. I can do it by myself. I'll let you do your work. We will call you for dinner. I would like to move into the house. To the exact same room Bax used for painting. -I don't have... -Wait... what do you expect to find? A source of inspiration? Or ghosts? Why not both? .... Waiter? Another bottle, please. .... I'm too tired. I have to get up at seven. -So no taco for us? -No. I'm very fond of luxury, but I know my limits. You going with me? -No, I'm sleepy too, but I'll stay. Have fun then. Don't drink too much. He seemed upset. Yes, he is. But don't worry, it's no big deal. Tell me about...Bax and Leticia. They met in Paris. What a place to meet. Then Leticia went for a journey through South America. -And Bax followed her. -He loved her madly. He was mad about everything. And later... Buenos Aires... -And here. -Yes Leticia found herself a "protector", very rich man whose name was Rafael Braun. He was my grandfather. I didn't know my grandparents, but my mother told me a lot about grandma Leticia. My mom loved her. You know anything more? Bax was a mysterious man. One time. he confessed to a friend that he was painting Leticia. -Bax and Leticia were probably lovers. -I'm not sure if that is true. But I'm sure he loved her. -Like crazy? -Like crazy. Good evening, Mother Night. Don't be so foolish. .... .... You had a nice chat? Yes, about some basic things. What basic things? What basic things? -Are you jealous? - .... What do you mean? How can I not be jealous? He's an artist and he's from Paris. .... -He's going to stay at the house to examine the painting. .... And if he finds anything we're gonna get a load of money. .... Leticia. -Not now, please. -I want to see you. -During the play. -No, face to face. Let's go, Leticia -You can come too, Bax. What a wonderful performance. You are a great singer. .... .... .... .... General Rodriguez... .... -Find yourself a date. -But he's a cockroach! -Allow me to introduce, Capitan Agosti and Miss Leticia Fieux. It's an honour. You're like a goddess! .... Why are you here alone? I like to stand in corners. as much as I like cockroaches. Handsome or not, for a man it's not important. Tell it to my mom. -Miss Leticia. -I'm sorry. The best pictures are from UFA. All genres of film. Dramas, comedies, comedy/dramas, costume films. Tell me more about it. .... .... .... .... .... .... .... -You like birds? -.... I would like to give you one from Galandia. -.... - It's sings beautifully. But still, it can't compare with you. .... -.... -.... What is more to cinema than theatre? .... Manipulated lights and colours. Broken figures and cunningly arranged fragments. The goal of this trick is to disclose the soul, Bax. The soul, indeed. -Water with honey? -Yes. You have a sensitive throat, dear. It's no good driving a colt to war so soon. .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... The humidity of Buenos Aires is bad for the vocal chords. Drink slowly. Capri, the famous isle of Capri... it's... See, she's never seen the Sun. Her skin is night-blooming. You think she would make a good model? Look at Bax. How contented. You know how to please your guests. This is Juan Bax. A great painter. More valued in Europe than in his motherland. Gentlemen, let's play. He's no good for you. You could leave him. -Don't you dare to insist. -I won't. Calm down, my dear, don't forget your weakness. What can I do to make you happy? Rafael, you are a busy man. Give me open credit to play. -I wish you luck, Amelia. -Thank you. Do you play cards? Maybe billiards? Don't you want to challenge Bax? I would like to paint a general. In a formal uniform? .... .... .... .... -Where are you going? Walk home with me. .... .... .... Leticia is excellent at billiards, but she needs to rest .... Don't look at me this way... .... No! What's going on there?! Sorry, I didn't know you were here. I should be sorry, I'm working late without your permission. You can work as long as you like. You need anything? No, thanks. -What time it is? -Midday. Let me invite you for a breakfast or... lunch Thanks, but no. Carlos is waiting for me in the car. -Maybe this evening? -Also no. Could you stay to see the painting? Not now. Just one moment... Thank you, but I already told you I can't. Maybe you'll come another day? Of course. I'll call you later. -A house with... -With a private theatre. A private theatre? And why not... .... A peculiar residence. Built by eccentric amateur maniacs. -I know one which had fountains inside -Yes, triumphal arch and a Roman temple. How do you know? You told me, Mister. But it's not the one I'm looking for. You're looking for the one with private theatre? I already know that. But it was a great theatre, a big one. Leticia Fieux performed there in '77 or '78. This could have been any famous singer. As well as everyone would like to sing at Colon [Teatro Colon - opera house in Buenos Aires] They come, they sing, they go. .... -The one you told me about... -Leticia Fieux. Yes. This one stayed... and married... And married mister... -Braun? -Braun, yes. A tyrant... who cut her career. Poor, poor woman. Seems like he kept her as a prisoner. If I remember well. I have a book with pictures of their house. Mirta! In this collection bought from a widow in Salerno, there's a volume, a red-bound volume. I hope it's not broken. The humidity is terrible. .... .... As I thought, there was a theatre in Braun's residence. It was burnt to the ground in 1929. What a disaster, no? What would I do if my books burned? Because a library is like a temple. A temple of memory. That's what I was looking for. How much does it cost? 50 dollars. Can't sell it for less. I'll pay. We'll pack it for you. If you ever need anything, call me. .... .... -What happened to you? -An accident. .... Good morning, Mr. Bax. Yes, I know, Mr. Brown does not think of heating in servants' room. Go away! You should know your pose. Take this off. Take it off. My throat hurts and I won't be able to sing this evening. Would you sing for the rabble like the other night? It won't be windy anymore, my darling. Take off your shawl. Don't move. I'd like some music. Play me something. And bring me hot chocolate. Ask for it yourself in the kitchen. Pay her and she'll go away. Excuse me, Miss Dickens. I slept horribly. I dreamt I murdered a woman. Would you be so kind and make me some hot chocolate? With pleasure. Would you sing to flatter an illiterate? .... Why are you so proud? Do you think you're better than Braun and his friends? We are wild animals. We should have children. I'll return to my career in a short while. And will go back to Europe. -With him? -Yes. We're getting married -Aren't you afraid? -I love him. -It's a lie. -Braun loves me. He doesn't love you like I do. I know, I know. You... You... but he exists. He also exists. Good day, Bax. Stop, please, or Bax will think we haven't seen each other in long time. .... Laura, calm down, it's not a good moment. I'm open to some changes, but don't make decisions on your own, that's not how it should be done. I think you should calm down. -We'll discuss it next week.. -Yes, thank you. -We haven't finished anything we started. -Give me a cigarette. Laura, if you want to finish the project there are people who need to be involved. I just don't like those people to make decisions without asking me first. .... Enough, Carlos. Have some champagne. Shall we celebrate? Laura, the Frenchman, did he buy your painting? -I don't know. -No, he'll say its fake and worthless. He wants to restore it, so maybe he's convinced it's real. .... He's staying at the house. -Is he on his own? -Yes. So why didn't you bring him here? -We need to find him a girlfriend. -What's he doing with the painting? -He wants to restore the original image. -How's it done? He rips the coating. So he paints something new? -No, it's called repainting -What if he rips everything off? Mr. Bax, continue with Mr. Braun. I'll be back later. Here's your chocolate. I want you to change the painting a bit and paint Leticia... naked. Your wish is my command. This girl will make the task easier... for you and Leticia. Sir has to see. Her body and Leticia's are very similar. Ask her anything, no matter how demanding. You'll do what the Master says. I pay. You should start. And don't forget it's a surprise for Leticia. A present for her birthday. -What would you like me to do? -We'll look at the other side. Cleansing, Laura. .... It useful in transforming an old house. .... .... .... The bond with old spirits only occurs in a condition of primal imbalance. And that break in consciousness makes us vulnerable to spirits' influence. -Are you afraid? -Why ask? -How much did he offer you? -Enough. .... -How much is enough? -Enough to look at your face. .... I'll offer you more. More? For what? .... I want you to... (inaudible) .... This is gonna cost you. -How much? -A lot. How much? .... .... How much will you pay me to touch a cockroach? .... .... Laura, please, stop, let's go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Come on, it's 3am. -I'm gonna go for a walk -Calm down. Are you mute? I don't want to sleep in this house. It's your house too. No it's not, and I don't want to sleep here. -Where will you go? -LEAVE ME ALONE! Laura? Yes? Are you unwell? No... Yes. I can't sleep. I'm wandering all night long. Ever had nightmares? I tend to forget them. I also wandered all night. Then I went to a small square and sat down. I watched the stars and I cried. I felt so lonely. I want to see the painting,. Come on. No, please, not yet! -Leticia? -Yes. -Who could have hidden her? -Him. -But why? -Why? Was she naked? I... I don't know yet, I still have some work to do. -Well then, it's a real Bax. -Yes. -There's no doubt. -Not one. Don't answer. Or tell them I'm not here. Hello? Yes, no, what? No, she's not here. -Was it Carlos? -Yes. I have never lied to him. What happened? We argued. So you came here to hide? It's my home. Shall we say you came here for me? Everything will change in the upcoming week. My mother was all about Leticia. She wanted me to be like her so she forced me to study singing. Musical dictation, sight reading, piano... What torture. Then she became quite exasperated when I sang so poorly. It was my father who saved me. He found me and took me to Paris. We understood each other well and I loved him deeply. At the same time, my mother never said a good word about him, because he had abandoned us. But he had his reasons. And when he died I came back here. I didn't know why I came back. I was 18, I told my mom I wanted to study architecture. "Architecture? What do you want to construct?" "The beauty here is incomparable." And she showed me this house. Can you dance the tango? "Why do you want to rebuild it?" "You'll never make it more beautiful". So then I went back. I went back to Europe. I studied, travelled and got my degree. And I never wanted to come back here. But, then I met Carlos... who talked me into coming back. And he told me that I have to let bygones be bygones, turn the page and erase bad memories. He convinced me. .... Come, I'll show you something. She wore that the night the fire started. How do you know that? I want to know where Laura is. Laura's not here, I'm sorry. We argued last night and she disappeared. "WOMAN MURDERED IN A HOTEL" I went to the police station... To the hospital... .... .... -I'm sorry to bother you. -No Carlos, listen. I'm sorry, I need to leave Buenos Aires immediately. What? I don't understand... And the painting? I'm buying it. We'll stay in touch to finish the formalities. Call us and we'll discuss the price. I don't have that much time. 200 000 dollars, agree? No, I thought about 250 000... Okay, 250 000 dollars. -Right? -Right. -Where were you last night? -We'll talk later. -No, tell me now. Where were you last night. Where? .... Carlos. I earned 250 000 dollars, for this shitty painting. -Good. -I'M TALKING TO YOU! .... .... Hurry up, his plane leaves at six. Are you afraid? -Yes, I am. -Afraid of what? I'm having hallucinations. I see things that don't exist, I'm having nightmares. It could be food poisoning, I don't know. Excuse me Leticia.... What is going on with you? Listen to me. You fool, would you pay so much money to be free of me? What a price! Listen to me, Eric. You can't leave now, I need to know where I stand I need some time. You understand? I'm... very tired. Exhausted. Here's what we'll do, let's forget about the painting and take care of ourselves. Let's go, you'll rest. You need to rest now, come. What are you doing? -Can I see? -No Well, so you can't either. -You're a scared little baby! -No, not anymore. You're not afraid of me? I could kill you now, here. Stop that, you're scaring me. Carlos? Who's there? I came to cleanse this house! .... .... .... But, the bad spirit that lives in this house, I see it. .... .... ... Eric... Please don't take it seriously. He's mad, he's dumb. I want to be alone. There is still time. Laura, save yourself. Can I see it? You don't obey your love's orders any more? We won't tell him. It'll be our secret. Are you sure? Yes. If you let me see the painting. I'll kiss you... On the lips. I don't know what's going on. .... .... .... .... Eric is still there. Are you serious? .... I'm scared, Carlos. -Of what? -He locked himself inside and I don't know what to do. How will it end? But what's the problem, I don't understand. How is that possible? Can't you see it? .... I'm no mind reader, you need to tell me. .... -I'm begging you to help me, Carlos. -Help you what? .... .... .... Leticia, Braun is a fool. Come with me. I could leave him, perhaps. He doesn't need you. Here you are a rare piece of art. And what is your offer? Eternal life. Will you go with me? I'll give you the answer after my performance. Destroy it. Do it for me. I'll do anything you ask me to. My Lady? Is everything all right? My Lady, are you asleep? The audience is waiting. I'm all right, I'll prepare on my own. Okay, okay. -Are you happy? -Very happy, if you love me, Braun. -How could I not love you? -So love me forever. Are you still upset? Don't be, I'll destroy the portrait. If artists believed in their dreams, it would be impossible to live. And what about him? We'll pay him something and everything will be over. Thank you, gentlemen. I'll see you later Thank you. Thank you. You kept your promise. [SUBTITLES TRANSLATED by stodwa for SMz]
