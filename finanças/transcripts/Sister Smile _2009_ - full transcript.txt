If you want to come to Congo, you have to stop that, And start to study seriously, - You sound like mother superior, Jeannine, there is gossip, They say that you doubt your calling, Have you seen my songs bring about? Through me they want to live, be happy, love, Working in an orphanage is more useful than making tunes, Bringing my 'tunes' millions up for your orphanage, Mother Superior asks for you, - I'm coming, Your daughter sings beautifully, We are very proud of her, We didn't want to be the last to congratulate you, I would like to have been informed, We have strict visitor rules, But now that you are here, Sister Luc Gabrielle, just sit in the refectory, I'll be right there soon, Yes, mother, This way, Your father keeps track of all articles, You will see, we have a box full, That's sweet, Do you like it?
