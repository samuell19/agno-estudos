Life doesn't always turn out the way you think it will. Sometimes it spins out of your control. You know what's right, but you still do things wrong. You know who you love, but you still hurt them. You know you've lost your way, but you carry on walking. Sometimes the people who save us are the ones who we least expect it from. You don't notice it at first, but when they come into your life, everything changes and nothing is like it used to be. THE MANNY Come on then, assholes! You didn't reckon with me! Just you wait! Yeah! This is my home. You won't take it away. I won't give it up without a fight. You'll have a fight on your hands with me! Come on... shit. What's that? Hello? Oh, shit! Shit! What the...! Oh, God! Shit! Where is the screaming coming from? It seems somebody wants to stop the wrecking ball with their face. Great! Stop gawping and clear the place! - Okay, okay. - Do it! Shit... Missed. Missed! Is that all you've got? You won't get me out of here! I said put me down! Put me down! Hello? I'm talking to you, Lord Helmet. What are you doing? You can't just leave me here. Hello? Where are you going? Ms. Nielsen, this is the object of desire. 200 million of pure profit. My partner and I would offer it to you exclusively. It's a prime piece of real estate, a superb location. Imagine how this place will be booming two years from now. Yes! Kids, families, future! - Why are the police there? - To help out. Who do you think pays the taxes? Them or us? That's what I call social justice. - Exactly! - Let's stop playing games. I know that you'll lose 100 million if I don't join you... So if you want me to be in with 150 million, come up with something to convince me. Gentlemen. Ms. Nielsen... It's just delaying tactics. I'm sure she's taken the bait. She'll only do that when the whole site has been cleared. She can do the math, you know. Okay! It should have been done months ago. But who can't get his act together? You! So what's the plan? One of us could... screw her. - Bullshit. We're not in her league. - You're not! And you are? You'd remind her of her first time. August, seriously... If this goes wrong... I don't want my kids sleeping under a bridge. If that happens, it'll be a beautiful bridge. Why did you become a nanny? Because I love kids more than anything. Kids are just so... cuddly. They don't scheme or tell lies, their hearts are open and they're just so... unspoiled. Why don't you have any of your own? It just never happened. Because you're infertile? - Nobody wanted to bone you, did they? - Pardon me? If I was a guy, I'd cut my dick off and throw it under a train rather than run the risk of banging someone like you. Are you on drugs? I'm just saying the truth. Hello? I'm a kid. I'm allowed. You can't talk to me like that. You're a very mean, nasty... - ugly girl! - You're ugly! You look like a mixture of thrush and herpes. I don't have to put up with this. Wash the cheap make-up off your face so we can see your beard at least. Ilona, where do you think you're going? Are you offended? Ilona? Come on, open up, please! Your mom really loved that flat. She'd be proud of you. Thanks, Gitta. That's sweet of you. It's terrible, Rolf. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Well, Steffi, it's... We haven't lost yet, have we? I mean... They win, we lose. Just because they took my apartment doesn't mean I'll let them intimidate me. - You can sleep in the kitchen. - I still have Heinrich's bed. I'm allergic to cat hair. Shit. What do we do now? We'll be next. No one-man protest like Rolf, at any rate. We have to do something. You could drop in on Klina and say "hello". - Dad, shut it. - Why not? That's what we'll do. I'll go to Klina and make him wish he'd never set eyes on me. What? My friends and I used to put a pot of water over the fire and hang our balls into it when the water started to boil. Your balls? Whoever took their balls out of the boiling water first was the loser. I never lost! Those poor balls. Are you crazy? That makes you infertile. Steffi, the point is, I never lost. I hung in there. You see? Remember this face, guys. It's the last thing Klina will ever see. This face here. Barn! Hello? Mr. Klina? Hello? Everything I once believed in... is now ground zero! I'm just lighting a cigarette. Want one? - Ilona? - Cigarettes... Just open the door. I'm dying. Mr. Klina. Your children are... Ilona. Ilona! - Ilona! - I quit. - Why is that, Ilona? - Your kids are psychopaths! Please don't do anything rash. Ilona, please. Take a deep, calm breath. Look at me. Ilona, you are a beautiful woman. Don't forget the notice period. Notice period? Screw the notice period. Your kids need a therapist, not a nanny. Ilona, Ilona. Do it for the kids. The kids need you. The kids worship you. They love you. You can't leave them, poor kids. How do they know about my uterus? I'm single. Single! Know what that means for a woman my age? Let me tell you something. Take your notice period and stick it... up your bottom. That was the fourth nanny in three months. - The seventh in twelve. - This must stop. I have so much to do... I need help, someone to look after you. Nobody has to look after us. Clemens, maybe there aren't any good nannies. Nonsense. She was from a first-rate agency. Nobody told you she's mentally unstable, did they? I'd just got attached to her, and you know what she said? She said I'm ugly. - Is that true? - Yes. And she said I'm too small for my age. - A dwarf. - What? Do you know how much that hurt us? - Stuff like that hinders our development. - I'm deeply traumatized. - Our hormones... - ...totally screwed. That's the saddest story I ever heard. Come here. Come on. Are you kidding me? I don't believe a word. Know what? I'll get a new nanny. I'm sure there are more. "That's so mean. You're terrible." "Daddy, Daddy you're so mean." "All the nannies are awful, oh dear." - "Rotz&G?r, we love your kids", hello? - Klina here. Clemens Klina? Yes. Hello? Hello? Shit. Don't celebrate too soon. "Child Watch" nanny agency, hello. Hello, Clemens Klina here. You dare to call us? You probably forgot what your kids did to our nannies. What was that? Kids! Time for lunch! Where are you? MY arm, my arm! This is all your fault, and you're next, you whore! Just a few childish pranks. They're kids, you know. Your kids are banned here. - Goodbye. - Hello? Wait a minute you stupid woman... Hello? Why are you doing this? I have to work, I have no time. I employ the best people, but... You won't find anyone anyway. - Bet I will. - Bet you won't. - Bet... - Bet you won't. You're about to get a clapping, and I don't mean applause. This city has over three million people, I'm sure we'll find someone. Shh... One second, I'm on the phone. Will you take a seat? Someone just turned up. Thanks. Thanks for coming. Do you know how happy I am to see you? No. - August? - Clemens, I have to talk to you. I'm in a job interview, can I call you back? Sorry, I have to take this... Stay right there. August, I'm just interviewing my kids' new nanny. Your kids! Know what the best nanny is? Contraception. Let's make one thing clear: you don't stand a chance. What? God, you're the ugliest woman I've ever seen in my life. Ah, Winnie. You didn't expect this. I'm so glad you're here. What agency are you from? Sorry, would you like a drink? - Can you get him a glass of water? - There's nothing I'd rather do. Then get him a glass of water, okay? - But... - Let's have a seat first of all. Come on. There you go. - What figure did you have in mind? - It's not about the money... A man of conviction! Sorry. Sorry, I have to take this. I'll be right back. - Ew, you're the guy? - And you are? - Your worst nightmare. - Sorry? This is Theo, my son. Did you introduce yourselves? - Could you leave us for a second? - No. Come with me. 1,900 euros a month. How does that sound? - No, Mr. Klina... - Fine, 2,500. - No, it's not about... - Okay, 3,000. The kids are looking forward to having a new nanny. - Nanny? - In your case, Manny. Babysitter. Nanny. Call it what you will. Here's 2,000 to start off with. Mr... what's your name? - Horst. - And your surname? - Horst! - Horst Horst? - Rolf. - You're called Rolf Horst? Yes. I'm sorry about that. Mr. Horst, 24 hours a day with the kids, including board and lodging. Tomorrow morning, 7:30. Can you make it? Yes, I think I can make it. Okay, buddy. Right. There you go. Welcome to hell, Gollum. How did it go? I think I have a real chance of stopping the construction. - Where will you chain yourself this time? - Chain? Listen, I went to his house, and I was absolutely livid. I went inside, he was standing there and I go up to him and clench my fist, and I raise it up, and my fist flies towards him, towards him like this, yeah? I know it sounds weird, but he offered me a job. - What? - Yes. As what? As a nanny. - You're Klina's nanny? - Not Klina's, his kids'. - What shitty plan is that? - Think about it, it's fantastic. If I'm with him all day, 24 hours a day, he'll get to know me, and then I can change his mind. I can show him what a great community we are and what he's destroying! Okay, but what if he doesn't care? Then... Then you sabotage his life. I sabo what? - King cobra. - What? Narcotriptin. Destroy what destroys you. Put some of this in his food, and it's game over. - I don't want to kill him! - It's a trip, dude. Six drops. - It takes effect after 30 minutes. - And then? Toodles! Six drops, Rolfi. Okay, six drops. - We count on you. - Okay? You are the Hobbit. This is your journey. Morning, Mr. Horst! - First day? - Yes, what? Morning, Mr. Klina! I brought you something. Two cuddly toys for the kids and flowers for the lady of the house. That's nice, but she's dead. Right. What? - What do you mean? - Their mother isn't around. Does that mean she's run off and she's as good as dead to you, or "dead" dead? Dead. - Do you want to talk about it? - No. Then you get the cuddly toy and Winnie gets the flowers. I'll show you the mansion. You can call me Rolf. It's beautiful here. A real homely place. Watch out, robot. Ms. Nielsen. How are you? Great to hear from you. - I want to see you in an hour. - In an hour? - Where? - Breakfast at the Korean. Korean breakfast. Whatever you want, Ms. Nielsen. - Come alone. Alone! - Fine. See you in an hour. - You have to go? - You'll manage fine with the kids. Let's keep this short. I have to go. These are the children's rooms... - This is Theo's. - Nice. When is he moving in? - This is Winnie's room. - Wow! - Has she read all of these? - No idea, ask her. "Wetlands." Geography, an interesting topic. Mr. Horst? Mr. Klina. There's something I'd like to talk to you about. - One moment. - It's important to me. - Yes? - August! Nielsen called. She wants to meet me alone. - This is your room. - Nice. I'll put the flowers in this vase. That's an umbrella stand. - Why alone? We're partners. - Who cares? As long as we get the money. If we get it, we need it right away. I promise this won't fall through. Trust me. Having fun, kids? Your dad has lots of stress at work. Stress? You have no idea. Everything is at stake. You know what? You have to stay focused. In one hour and fifteen minutes I'll be the happiest man in the world. Come on. Mr. Horst, this is the garden. - Koi carp in the pond. Ever heard of them? - Can you eat them? That's 150,000 euros swimming in there. - So you can't eat them? - No. - Do you know the "Angler Eck" bar? - In the Fisher district? - Yes. - I'm tearing it all down. Why? I wanted to talk to you about... - You want to invest? - No. Have you been inside, Mr. Klina? It's a wonderful community, lovely people, great atmosphere. Don't be absurd. I tore down such a shithole yesterday. A woman had chained herself to the fridge screaming, "Get me out of here!". She was attached to her home. And her fridge. Maybe, but who cares? We have to go, come on. Just you wait. Please take the kids to school. - My big meeting is in 50 minutes. - Shall I make you a coffee? That would be nice of you. Filter, espresso, don't tell me... - Cappuccino. - I thought so. - Where is the kitchen? - Behind you, Mr. Horst. Off we go. I'm having trouble sleeping again. - Can I sleep in your room? - Theo, you can't do that anymore. - I'm a woman now. - Where? So, kids, looking forward to school? We're looking forward to this afternoon when we're alone with you. Yeah. Did you know the walls here are so thick that nobody can hear your cries for help? Yeah. Everything okay? Sure. It's child's play. Oh, God! I'm warning you, okay? I mean it. - Want a coffee too? - No. I don't like caffeine, no caffeine... How about some vitamins? Of course, always. - Here's to... - ...chugging it. ...to working together. We'll wait in the car. Mr. Horst. Off you go. The kids. - What's your school called? - Hogwarts. Hogwart? Never heard of it. Is that with G or CK? With G, you brain. Oh heck, it's an automatic. I've never driven one before. When you want to drive, put it in "R". R? Doesn't that mean "reverse"? No, it means "run". It's English. Don't you speak English? Sure, but only "yes", "no" and "come on". When you want to drive off, you have to really hit the gas, or the car judders. You've earned one of nanny's stars for that. You know them? Can you just drive? We're in a hurry. Of course, young lady. And... "R". All right then. No. No! Please no! Wait! Holy shit. Ferrari. I don't believe this! Are you crazy? How could you? That's a Ferrari! It's not funny. You need some hardcore chilling. Hardcore chilling, my ass. Clemens, he's a complete moron. A danger. He needs to go. The nanny stays. You two do whatever you want. - Mr. Klina? - Mr. Horst... - Stop saying Clemens. I'm your dad. - Don't overdo it, Clemens. - Get to your rooms! - What? No school today? The car, I mean! Get in the car! - Oh, God! - The poor fish, Mr. Klina. I'm so sorry. I tried to save the car. On my first day! Nothing like this has ever happened to me. - Mr. Horst, don't worry. As long... - But I do worry, Mr. Klina. I had an aquarium, I know how you feel. You're okay, that's the main thing. The car is property damage. The insurance will cover it. It's a shame about the fish, but hey. - I'm happy you're here. - What does it mean? That you have a lot of work in store. You relax, and I'll drive us all to school. - What about your meeting? - Welcome to the family, Mr. Horst. Welcome to the family. Ferrari. So this is Hogwarts? Are you okay? I'm wonderful. How are you? I'm thirsty. Too much stubble... Bye, kids. Don't you give your dad a kiss? As if. Mr. Klina, we should really have a little talk about your kids... Mr. Klina? Mr. Klina! We have to go. Hi, Keno... Keno, hey man! Your meeting. Mr. Klina? Where did you get that? Wanna go to prom with me? Shit, did I say prom? Party, say party. Party, party, party. Hi, Keno. - What's up? - About the farty, I mean, party. Want to go with me? What? Keno, there's that party tomorrow. I want go with you. How about it? Sweet. Sure, I'm down. I asked first. Chill your ovaries, loser. Did you even get your period yet? - Don't talk to me like that. - Back of the queue, sixth grader. Keno is a little out of your league. Did you forget your tampon today? Here's one. - Go away! - The hell I will! Drop dead! What's your problem? Winnie, seen your dad? - No! - Okay I asked him first. You can't take everything you want. Yes I can, you loser. You should be put back in and aborted. Bitch fight! Have you lost it? Let her go, you bitch! Let me go! Please. Mr. Klina! May I ask what it is you're doing? I have a complaint. I'm thirsty and my drink is stuck in this shitty... - Mr. Klina! We have to go. - No. Mr. Klina will first talk with me about his kids. Why should I talk to you about my kids? You skank! That's why. Extensions are for whores! Mr. Klina, we need to go. Stop that! That's enough. Once and for all, get to your classrooms! That's right. And make it snappy! Jeez! - Who are you? - Rolf Horst. The nanny. Off you go! Mr. Klina, do you actually talk to your children? Do you communicate? Yes. Do you open my letters every now and then? - What letters? - Exactly. If you did, you'd know your children might have to be removed. - What? - Yes. What on earth is this bullshit... It's not bullshit. I quit school after ninth grade. At evening school I very successfully... - Mr. Horst... - Sorry. Just in case it escaped your notice, I've signed you and your children up for therapy. Family therapy. Anti-aggression. It's on a raft. This is your last chance. If that doesn't help, I will remove your kids from the school. - Do we understand each other? - Sorry? Is it really necessary? Excluding the kids from school... Family therapy sounds great. - Take this opportunity. - We will... take it. Sorry. Stop, stop! I have to drink... something. Mr. Klina! You have to call off "Fisher Bay Estate". You can do it! Yes, I can. - What? - I'll do it. - Really? - Yes. I promise. What the...? - It's working. - It is. - It's working. - I can do it. Come on, do the right thing. You'll save lives. We're counting on you. All of us. It's in there. The turtle head is touching cloth. Ms. Nielsen? Ms. Nielsen? Ms. Nielsen isn't here yet. Can I bring you something? I'm thirsty. Drink? Water? No? - Ne? - Yes, take a seat. Do you have any cream with you? - And tampons? - Sure. - Man, it really burns. - Your job doesn't seem to be working out. - Why? - Did you talk to that building jerk? Much, much better. He's meeting a very important investor right now. - And guess what he's on? - On the roof terrace? No, Keiler. On those drops you gave me. I went to the kitchen, crept over to the coffee machine and thought: Six drops? I don't do things by halves. It's either all or nothing. My way or the highway. And I poured all of it, the whole bottle into his coffee. - Are you nuts? - Why? - You can't do that. - Why not? What can happen? Here. Hello? He'll survive. Well, I hope so. - Mr. Klina? - Mr. Haseyo? Come here. Do you hear that? No. Ms. Nielsen will be here soon. As long as he doesn't drink any alcohol. Not a single drop. That's the main thing. That can't be. This is a great place for doing business. Well, then. I wanted to meet you alone because you seem to be the hands-on one in the partnership. A business is like a relationship, and before you enter a relationship you should get to know each other better. Abso-lutely. My mother taught me that you can only have success in business if you listen to your heart. Yeah? You know what I did when I got my first paid job? And then I kicked her out. Your heart! With that attitude, guys in this business will just jizz in your face. Yes! And I hate that. To me, you and your partner... are just two little boys trying to get into an older girl's panties. If I get into bed with you, I expect the place to be made nice and clean beforehand. So what's the deal? Is it clean? Yes, the... thing is clean. Ms. Nielsen... You have to trust me... But trust... is something you have to earn. You have the balls, but you still don't have my signature. Cheese. Keno. Winnie, has your dad called you? - Get out! - Oh God... - I have to speak to him urgently. - So what? - Did he call? - No, he didn't. Get lost. You need to get out. Close the door! - Sorry. - Get out! Theo? Theo?! Keep really... ought... huh? Theo? Theo, your dad... What on earth is this? Help! Get me down! Didn't you read the warning? What warning? I wanted to know if you've heard from your dad! No, I haven't. What are you doing there? Tax return. Tax? Do you need help? No. I can do it. Sure, whatever you want. But I know about electricity. And the story I can tell you about it isn't pretty at all. Do you want to hear it? A friend of mine once wanted to mess with a fuse box. He opens the thing up... and gets such a huge shock that both his hands are torn off. Know how he runs his hands through his hair? - No. - He doesn't. It's heavy. It's not working at all now. Did you take a look at the rollers? Give it here. Just as I thought. Now it should work. - How did you know that? - My dad and I used to tinker around a lot. Once we tried to make a television out of an oven. Really? It looked right but we couldn't get a signal in there. Grandma was angry because she couldn't bake cakes anymore. Do you know what we called it? A "toven". Oh, well. My dad has never built anything with me. Listen, if you ever need help... Just contact me, I live in this house after all. And in case you already forgot, I am Rolf. Your nanny. Theo. Mr. Klina? ls everything okay! Are you still alive? There you are! - How do you feel? - No idea. - How was it with Ms. Nielsen? - How do you know her? - I drove you there yesterday. - Yeah? - Yes. How was it? - Ah, shit. - Shit? - Help me... - Shit. - Shit then? - Shit... - Not so good then? I'll make you a coffee, all right? Since when do we have pancakes for breakfast? Since we have a new nanny. What's up with you? It's unhealthy, too much sugar. So what? It tastes good. - Get this down you. - Thanks. You stink. You should shower before the therapy. What therapy? - The thing on the raft... - Here. What? I have no time for therapy. Great, so we get kicked out of school. Thanks. You won't be kicked out. The therapy is going ahead. I'll talk to him. Just one sec. Mr. Klina, whatever plans you have, do this, you owe it to your children. - When is it? - At two. You drive to school and pick up the kids. I'll come a bit later. I need a few painkillers. I'm sorry your meeting went so badly. Because it did, didn't it? I'm completely destroyed. It was a nightmare. Guys! Guys, yes, yes! I've done it! I don't want to exaggerate, but if I went into politics, we could really change things. Rolf Horst, your man in Berlin for justice and small repairs. Awesome, right? You legend. Did you sleep with your head up a pussy? You stink of fish. - What? - How did you get her to come around? Know what happened here last night? What's going on here? What happened? No, no! I remember having one of those drinks in a pouch. - Then I had champagne with Nielsen. - Okay. And then... I don't remember anything. You think she put something in my drink? Drugs maybe? She could sprinkle crack on your cake for all I care. They're moving out! Hats off. Wow. I don't believe it. It was a monster! I saw it quite clearly! You're working magic with that guy. Everything is worse now you're there. It's not easy. He's impossible to get to. Try telling that to these guys. Come on, sweetie. I'll sort it, trust me! How will you do that? - I'll build a raft. - What? I'll build a raft. I'm not a loser. What is he building? Your children aren't aggressive because they want to be, but because they have to be. Aggression is a survival instinct, but it needs to be steered, brought under control. Can we finish building this damn shitty raft please? That boy is ugly. - That's my daughter. - Sorry. Winnie, apologize to her father. I'm her mother, you jerk-off. Come on, kids. Carry on. What a stupid pitch. The word is bitch, not pitch! Can't you speak proper? Hey, want me to punch your lights out? - Reading the guide! Way to go, Theo! - Good. Very good. Feel free to give more encouragement. Give them lots of praise. Praise helps. You're wonderful with your children. Are you stupid? He's not my dad. Do I look like an owl? That's my dad. You decided to come! - Are you the father? - Uh, yes... - Cell phones aren't allowed. - My whole life's in that. Your whole life is over there, waiting for you. Your job is to be here so your kids find their way back to you, okay? Mr. Klina, it's great you're here. Your kids are so happy. The raft is going to be great, and when we're on the water... Ship ahoy. Sweetie. Just go. Just go away, anywhere! You sit up straight. - I hate you. - And you stink. We're building a raft. Can't you just shut your face? The air is good. Isn't it, kids? Isn't the air good? Mr. Klina, now that it's just the two of us, do you have time to talk about a building project? - Why would I do that with you? - Because it's important. Mr. Horst, I'm definitely not going to do that now. - But it's important to me. - Please... - Mr. Klina, please. - Why... Can you not talk about work for once? Theo, it's not about work, it's about human lives, - okay? - Watch your tone. You're the nanny... You're never there to talk to! - You only started yesterday. - Don't bother, Rolf... I've been trying to talk to him for years. He's never there. - That's not true. - It is. - No, it's not. - It definitely is. It's true, you never have time. Never when we need you! - Then why are we here? Because we want to stay in school. - Exactly, they want to stay in school. - This is family business. Don't you get it? "We" are not a family. Yes, we are! Our family's here so you don't screw up your future. You don't care about our future! You just hate being stuck with us two. - That's why. - We're here because you caused trouble. I'd rather be with you when I choose to be. Are you kidding me? You've never chosen to be with us! We used to have a mom and a dad. Now we have nothing at all. Nothing! We're going home. - This isn't the place to argue. - Of course it is. Huh, an island? I have an idea. It may be stupid, but they'll have to talk to me. To hell with the damn anti-aggression-raft! - Nobody moves! - How are we supposed to? Shit! We're capsizing! Help! I can't swim! Help! The raft! Shit! Oh man, now the boat is just floating away! Come on. - Why can't you swim? - You wanted to teach me, but never did. Theo. Clothes off everyone, or we'll get sick, and then we're dead. I know from experience. Winnie, take that off. Leave me alone! I hate you. I hate you! Come on, Theo, otherwise you'll get sick. Get lost! Asshole! It's not going too well with the kids, huh? Mr. Klina, I was a kid once, too. No shit. And after arguments like that, where I was usually wrong... I always feel wronged, I cried. I spat at everyone and just kicked out. Once I was so angry, I puked on the rug. I was a really ugly little jerk. But today, I mean, come on. I turned into a pretty cool guy. And your kids, they're cool too. In a certain way. And you, Mr. Klina, you... You're really neat. Really. You're a neat guy. You never have any time, but you can sort things out if you work as a team and support and help each other. Your kids are worth it, they're great. They're creative and imaginative and funny. Know what they did yesterday? Yesterday at breakfast they put something spicy in my juice. I tell you, my ass was on fire. But I found it funny. - Really? - It's still burning. Horrific. - They get that from my wife. - Guaranteed. Look, I'll help you with the kids and you'll help me, deal? - You promise? - Yes. I'll think of something. Kids, I just talked to your dad. He's a bit weird, isn't he? He's retarded. It's a shame actually. I'm sorry for you. So... good luck. Rolf? Rolf? - What? - Where are you going? Mr. Horst? Please come back. That's not funny. We'll die if you leave us with Clemens! - What did you say to him? - Mr. Horst! I didn't say anything. It doesn't matter. What do we do now? Please come back! Mr. Horst! Could you please... Kids... - I'll swim and get help, okay? - I'm not staying here alone with Theo. What if something happens to us? There are mosquitoes, ticks, wild animals, no toilet and no Facebook... - Then you get help, I'll stay. - Do I look like I have a bikini with me? I just want to go home! Okay, kids... I'm sorry about what I said. You were right. You were right. If you want to leave this island and go home, then... Let's build a real raft! Us three, as a team. You could never build a raft without materials and instructions. But I could! Rolf? Let's go! See what a difference it makes spending time with the kids? We can't go in there. I'm building here. Mr. Klina, take a look at what wonderful people live here. They'll kill me. They won't kill you. Anyway, you promised to help me. Clemens, I really need to use the bathroom. I'm going in. Come on, it's starting to rain. Off you go. We have visitors. Go on, in you go. This is my family. These guys are amazing. You'll see... This is Steffi. She's the heart of the place. Is there a bathroom here? I need to go. Out back. Press the flush twice, it sticks. Thanks. It's raining. This is Gitta. A medal-winning long-distance runner in East Germany. Yes, I ran my legs right off. That was in the 70s. She was 50. This is Keiler. - Pest controller. - And masseur! - I'd advise against the massage. - Especially the Thai one. Why are you stabbing me in the back? Who did you bring along? This is an old... friend of mine. And his son, Theo. - What's that smell? - Cooking fat. It's currywurst day. What? Every day is currywurst day. Excuse me, do you have a telephone? Yes, we do. And where? There... - So, may I...? - Sure. I'll give you the phone. Or you can use mine... Sorry for being so formal. - Steffi? - Steffi, right. I have a cell phone, if that's better? You could use that. Landline is fine. - Then use the landline. - I'll do that. Okay, the landline. It's, uh... I've got it. Good. Landline. Thanks for... ls there a way to lock the door? No, there isn't. - But I can keep a look out if you want. - No way! Okay, but move away and block your ears. Okay. What do you want to drink? Urn... a Sex on the Beach. No, actually, I'd like a really good Orgasm. You little rascal. - Thanks. - You're welcome. What's your name? Sven. - And you? - Winnie. Theo's leading 3:0. Theo, you're up. No idea. Don Johnson? - Longboarding. - Ah, longboarding. I did that once on the Baltic coast. Amazing, really cool. My turn. - Boilermaker. - Wow. 4:0. And... action. Here. I've drawn it for you. Hansel and Gretel? Because you didn't believe me. This is how it looked like. - What? - That thing I saw in the night. - It's a palm tree. - Nonsense. It looks more like a squid. Quite right, a squid. You're spiraling towards dementia, aren't you, darling? I'm not demented! Isn't this wonderful? It's great here, right? This is a family. You can't destroy this, Mr. Klina. Did you say Klina? Like that building jerk? No, he's a different Klina. - You've got a nerve coming here. - It wasn't my idea... I just wanted him to get to know us. Yeah, he's about to do that! - Maybe we can become friends, then... - I don't want a friend like that. You have to meet halfway, Manni. Are you stupid or what? He takes our homes, and you bring him to visit! I offered you heaps of money for something new. If you're too stupid to use it, it's not my problem. We don't want something new, you moron. You're wasting your time. All this belongs to me now. I can do whatever I want with it, understand? Manni, no! You disgust me! You think money can buy everything. Did you pay your wife to have kids? - Watch what you say! - Get out or I'll make you. You're a good reason to tear this down! Mr. Klina, you're not helping things! You asshole! Out! You jobless layabouts. - Get out! - You losers. - You prick! - Mr. Klina, please, Mr... You damn traitor. It's time to play hardball. Dude, are you crazy? What were you doing there? - When will you get the eviction notice? - No idea. As soon as I offer the judge the penthouse. Let's drop the kids off. I'll go to Nielsen, you go to the judge. Yeah. We'll finish it off tomorrow. I'm sick of jobless trash busting my balls. Winnie... Winnie, listen. - You look after Theo, okay? - What? - I wanted to go to a party. - You're not going to any party. - Why not? - Because you're a child. Listen... We'll do something cool together next week. - We'll go... - We'll go to the zoo. - Go there yourself, you ape. - Or the funfair? How about that? August... - We have to work together. - You're so shitty! - Winnie... - Drop it, okay? See you later, you two. I don't think you're shitty. - What are you doing? - No more doing things by halves. - Explosives! - Right. Good stuff too, from East Germany. Grenades, C-4, Semtex... - Put it in that prick's basement. - I can't do that. There are kids in there. They're a family, like us. They don't know it, but they are. Rolfi, I wasn't asking. That goes against our principles. Either you do it, or we will. Understood? It's activated! Winnie? - What are you doing? - None of your business! That's dangerous. Come down. - I'm staying here. - Come down right now! - Get lost. - Okay, I'm coming up. Everything's shit anyway. Life, boys... Don't do anything silly. I'm coming! - Everything is shit! - I'll get you down. Don?t jump! Through the window, you brain! Okay. Winnie, listen to me. Shit! Stay where you are, I'm coming to you. What the hell am I doing here? You're crazy. Life is shitty sometimes, you're right there, but... Oh my, this is really high up. That's no reason to jump off. You're so young! Are you stupid? I don't want to kill myself. What then? I'm here because I'm pissed! I wanted to go to a party, and I'm stuck with Theo. Oh, right. That's a relief. I love parties, you know. Parties are great. I love dancing. The polonaise is my favorite. - Rolf, I don't care about dancing. - What then? Keno. Kaya is going and if I don't go, she'll get her claws into him. - But I want him. - Okay. - Do you have a plan? - Yes, I think so. And the plan is, you go there and talk to him? Are you stupid? I can't just go and chat him up. So you want to go, and don't talk to him? He's the coolest, everyone fancies him. You can't just chat him up. Just because he's the coolest doesn't mean he's right for you. Does he have a good heart? Is he funny? Can he look after you? No idea. But it's the party! And now I'm trapped here and can't get away. When will your dad be back? He'll probably be out all night. Two hours. Go to the party for two hours. I'll stay here and look after Theo. - Seriously? - Seriously. It seems important to you, so fight for it. If something is important to you, you fight for it. You'll learn that. Talk to him, or don't, just chill hardcore... You're the best. - Thank you. - Winnie... - You'd be a really cool dad. - Really? I don't know... Winnie! Two hours and not a minute longer. Okay. Can we go down now, please? - Ms. Nielsen. - Helen. Thanks for taking the time. How do you see things? I would do it right away. Let's not waste any more time. - How did you find it last time? - Great! - Is that a yes? - It depends. On what? An official yes or no? Official? What are you talking about? - What are you talking about? - Us. And you? The demolition, the construction. I see. Do you think I offer that to everyone? Most people don't even get my money, let alone this. And... Let's build this thing. - A shot of vodka, please. - How old are you? I'm 20. What's with this Keno guy? What does it even mean? Is he Japanese? No, Keno is just short for Kevin Norbert. He's called Kevin Norbert? Yes. Rolf Horst. - Here's your knife. - Keep it, it's a present. - I can't accept it. - Please do. Really? Thanks. What time is it? Winnie should have been back ages ago. Pick up. - Hello? - Winnie? I can't talk right now. Winnie, do you hear me? - Clemens. - Man, - I've sorted it, we start tomorrow. - Yes! Tomorrow all this will be jizzed away. You stay in the car. Okay. I've got a show here anyway. Keno! Keno! Wait! - Not her again. - Leave her. Hi Keno, great to see you. We said two hours. Have you been drinking? No. How cute, Winnie's nanny is here. Time for bed? Nanny? He looks more like a tranny. Watch it, Kevin Norbert. I'll tranny you in a minute! - Come on. Winnie, let's go. - I can't go, now yet. - Get in. - I had no chance to get to him. I'll get you a soda. Everything okay? I feel sick. Sorry, I really need that soda for my... daughter. Twenty euros. It costs two in the supermarket. - I'm not a supermarket. - I'm not an idiot. Winnie! You have to sit in the back, you baby. Where's your child seat? What are you doing? Okay, got it. - Winnie! - Ah! Everything okay with you? Winnie! Stop the car! Winnie, stop the car. Watch out! S-H-I-T! Oh, shit! Winnie! Theo! Are you okay? The doctor said you can take your daughter, - but first sign here. - She's my daughter. Then you take her. There you go. Why did you go to the party? I told you not to. - I said she could go. - Sorry? No, that's not true. I just ran off. A wild boar ran in front of the car. - In the middle of Berlin? - Incredible. Get in the car. Get in the damn car! I can live with my kids harming nannies, but not the other way around. You are the one who destroys everything. - Who let her go to the party? - I did. - Yes, you. - Because she's in love. - She's what? - Your daughter is in love! Nonsense. How would you know that? Because she told me... Wonder why your kids don't talk to you? Because you couldn't care less about them, you're always working and never at home, wherever you go, you destroy everything - and people lose what they love most! - I don't destroy things at all. I give people new perspectives. That's what I do. The only one who has lost everything is me, okay? My family and my wife. Not true. You have two wonderful kids! When will you realize it? Get off your ego trip! You're fired. I'll tell your agency. What agency? I'm not even a nanny. You just employed the first person to come along, so you could get your kids off your back. Here... Take that, and that, and that. I hope that's enough for untrained staff. Now get out of our lives. Enjoy the last few hours in your shithole before I tear the whole place down. Shall I tell you why I came to your house? - Yes, why? - For this! Good morning you two. Who wants a pancake? I made pancakes. There you go. And I have a surprise for you. I thought we could take a trip together this weekend. - With Rolf? - No. I had to let Rolf go. - We want to keep Rolf. - Clemens, you said the nanny stays. That's right, I did say that, but we don't need a nanny anymore. I'll look after you from now on. I'll be here for you. I just need to close the Fisher project today. - You're destroying his home. - Whose home? You saw how they treated us. I'm doing this for us. - You're doing it for you! - No, for us. - Leave us out of it. - Shall we talk about it? No. Okay. I'll be back in three hours. Then we can all go away. As a family. - I love you. - No, you don't. You only love your work. - I love you. - Just go. Hey, buddy. In three hours. What do we do now then? I have an idea. - Well? - Give me a moment. Got it. Shit, your building jerk has really gone and done it now. No. We won't give this up without a fight. We just have to stand firm. No, you have to tell him his mansion has a few kilo of explosives under it. Just help build the barricades. I have it under control. We're on the winning side. Stop, stop! - We have to get in. - Go away. You have to move along, got it? - Shit. - Go! - Get them out of here. - I'll see to it. Immediately. Rolf! What are you doing here? It's too dangerous. We have to fight, you said that yourself! Showtime. - What's going on? - Everything's under control. The prime cut. - You have to go. - No, we're staying! We're staying here! We're staying here! Rolf! Stop the demolition! Stop the demolition! Why are you just standing there? Do something! FISHER DISTRICT FOREVER We're staying here! We're staying here! Kids, it's too dangerous. You have to go. No, we're staying. We're helping Rolf. That's Klina! You want to steal our homes! Come here, you... MY Car! Clemens! Let me through. Clemens, look at me! Sign the contract. It's everything we've worked for. Please. I don't want to see these guys anymore. Get them out of here. - Call it off. - Don't call it off. You just made the biggest mistake of your life. No, know what that was? These damn kids. That's your biggest mistake. Retreat. I knew it. You're one of us. Thank you, thank you! I told you if I could get to him, I could change his mind. I told you! I'm sorry. - You finally did something right. - She's right. Dad. In every life you reach a point where you have to decide between what you need and what you want, and if you're lucky you'll find the person who saves you and changes everything. I really need your help now. You have to look after the flowers. They need to be watered after sunset. Don't forget to close the hatch in the evening. And check the gutter. If it gets blocked with leaves, all the water runs into the yard and the whole truck might float away. If there's any problem, just call me. Can I rely on you? Of course. It's going to be great. We'll do it, Rolf. - Have fun on vacation. - Bye! - I've never been on vacation. - Yes you were, with me. - Where was I? - You were there. - Says who? - Dad, you're impossible. Who does the bar and who serves? - I'll do both. - Then I'd like a beer. Everybody here? - Winnie? - Here. - Theo? - Here. - Sven? - Here. - Clemens? - I'm right here. Can we set off? Soon. Where's Steffi? I'm here. Theo, a boat trip like this isn't easy. There's danger everywhere. Water, waves, wind, monsters, gonorrhea... What sailors risk picking up in the harbor, goodness me... Can you please stop talking shit? You shouldn't curse. - Come on, I know what gonorrhea is. - What then? It's something you get from boning.
