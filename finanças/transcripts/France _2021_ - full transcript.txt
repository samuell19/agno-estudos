Just a second. Yes, sweetheart. Yes, all right. It's ok, I'll be home soon. Ask Cathy to make you something. Of course. Yes, sweetheart. Dad'll be home early. And I'll hurry. I have to go. Love you. Grangier will be there. Speak before that asshole. Just one. Great, thank you. Let's go. Thank you. Once they attack the economy, talk about insurrectional instability. - Hello, Jacques. - France. Mr Minister... - Fuck him over. - Seriously? Fuck him over! - I get bitchy? - Just don't overdo it. Once the questions begin, stand up. - I waste him? - Exactly. You waste him! France! The government, ladies and gentlemen... France de Meurs? I wished to meet you all as the French listen and watch to sum up our fellow citizens' expectations. Now, your questions. I don't have the mics. France de Meurs for i. Mr President, one may wonder about the insurrectional state of French society. Are you heedless or powerless? You're very harsh. All right... On this first topic... There's room for improvement, but I'm not heedless. However, this is a country where disagreements are expressed firmly, along with protests, and where unanimity rarely accompanies the changes required. I personally have stood firm during my first two years in relation to the heart of our project in which I believe. We owe answers to the French people, our fellow citizens. So let's avoid all caricature and I consider we must carry out the reforms. I stand by our commitment to "better work", in answer to your question, and feel we can improve, taking things further than we envisaged. You were the focus. People saw he would pick you out. That smile between you... Crazy! It was unbelievable, even for me. I was... That thing between you... People love it, France. You've no idea. It's a triumph. He was charmed. That smile... He fell for me. You're going viral. "France de Meurs for president!" Ridiculous. It's heating up. People love you so much. Hot as fuck. You're France's top journalist, France. France! An autograph, please! People are so... - Ren! - Hello! - Ok for that narration? - Yes, see Lou. I'll call you, René. Let's go. What is the priority? Is it reducing inequality to reduce the debt? People in work will pay contributions and taxes. The debt will shrink. That's the "magic button". Press it and everything works. Press it and everything works. But the economic reality is different. Excuse me! I'm afraid we have to stop. It's a big topic. Listen... No reconciliation tonight. Our viewers see the risks and expected benefits of this policy. Thank you and, coming up, Alexandre Debert and the culture report. See you next Monday at 7 pm. Good night. A VIEW OF THE WORLD Thank you. For God's sake, guys... Listen to each other! None of it made sense. No sense in asking me to come. Hold on, Nabil. I'll tell you what the problem is. Your cock got bigger. We can't frame you from that angle. You always have a kind word. I'll tell you what the problem is. She said she'd change gender. No way! Will she say it live? You can't really lie on the news. "I'm the weatherman now." See you next week? See you Friday? Friday, 9 pm. Ok, that's a date. See you. No more arguing! They'd make a good match. Are they gay? I'm amazed. No, really, it was... so unexpected. Bye, Jojo. Not saying goodbye? I'm talking to you. - Jojo. - Leave me be. - I have a flight. - Stop it. - What's the game? - Leave me be! Don't be mean. Stop it. Stop. Cut it out! You made me die. We frequent different people. He doesn't like me. I'm not his type. Today's mission? We're meeting a local Tuareg chief to provide support in fighting the jihadis. Thank you. Got that, Lolo? - Thank you. - You too. Come on, shoot the reverse angle. All set? Salam aleikoum. Translate my question. The French army supports you against ISIS. How is France's lasting involvement in domestic affairs viewed by the local people? The people had been suffering daily for years. The French army helps us to fight the enemies of Allah. Everyone here. is a farmer fighting for his land. We'll redo it. Got that? All right. Want to take a photo? Whisky! Let's do the questions. Follow me. Thank you. I'll stand by the water, with my back to it. - I'll repeat the question. Ready? - Hold on. Tell me when. Ok, ready. Ready to do it again? France... The French army... The French army backs your fight against ISIS. How is France's lasting involvement in domestic affairs viewed by the local people? Got that, Lolo? Do some cutaway shots. One of this soldier. Excuse me. Could you possibly... Can you translate? Can you come here? We need some Cutaway shots. Could you pass the camera on the right? And look at it. Hold on, I'm in the frame. Say when. Go on. Walk straight and look at me. That's great. Got that? Got 'it. A shot of the chief? Get into position. Sir... Look up there for the camera. Straight up there. Look at my hand, like this. Look up here, that's it. Great. No. Tell him to look, please. Ok, Lolo, you got it? Look up there now. Go on, that's it. Up here! Here. No, just look. Look up there. - Your headscarf. - Got it? Like this. Try to look stronger. Hold your weapon like this. Look a little tougher. Up here. Look at my hands. All right? That's it. That's it... Great, that's it. Can that guy over there sit down and get up? You, understand? Can you ask him? That guy there. Can he stand and raise his gun? When I say "action", ok? Great, let's go. When? I say "action". Action! Hopeless... - You got him? - Good for me. Action! Great. That's it. Cut! That's the lot. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Ok, guys. We met Major Damiens and his men of Operation Ouad trying to support the loyalist forces against the Salafist jihadi groups. Under French army escort, we briefly met an armed loyalist group, mostly farmers, and their chief, who, close to enemy factions, fight for inhabitants worn down by years of conflict. The French army supports you against ISIS. How is France's lasting involvement in domestic affairs viewed by the local people. The people have suffered for years. The French army helps fight Allah's enemies. We're simple farmers fighting for our land. We want to become farmers again. But can these tribes be trusted? Are these men what they say when suspicion reigns in relation to all? Their determination, as our images show, is faultless and unhesitant despite being cast unwillingly into a fratricidal war. A report shot a few days ago somewhere in the Sahel, among the fighters and French forces caught up in this endless conflict. Omar Ouahman, you're familiar with the area. How are the French army and these armed groups fighting jihadism? France has to work with the most moderate to turn them against the jihadi group's infesting this area spread over several countries. That's not the problem. I love your show, Chouchou. See you tomorrow for A View of the World. Have a good evening. France just isn't into that. I'll confirm later. - Well? - Great! Just look at them. Fantastic. Cool. Let's go? Hold on, France. - Chouchou's show, 15 minutes. - Not her. Come on... They'll take your Tuareg report. All right? And Fred for his book too? I can ask. Do I confirm? It's give and take. If they take Fred, fine. Cool. What's so funny? - I've put on weight? - You're beautiful. - My ass is getting big. - Let's go. Fred... What's this photo? It's 10 years old. 10 years old and you're tanned. It was summer, I was in shape. You're very handsome. It's in your mom's garden. His first communion. Can I watch TV? So when was it? Not long ago: Homework done? You wrote it there? Is it touched up? - What? - Touched up. Not at all. I look touched up? It's a photo I took in Cartagena six months ago. Cartagena? You look really good in it. Thanks to the photographer. Are things ok with Fred? So-so. So-so. So-so. What do you think of the book? A novel-essay is daring. It's really good. But why not just do an essay? Because I'm a novelist. It has more rhythm than usual, it's livelier. When an essay should be boring. If I were you, I'd do nothing. I'd leave things as they stand. There are times when... Times when you mustn't... You need to... do nothing. That's already a lot. Yeah... You have to play hard to get. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Jo, walk from here, ok. Or you'll be late. Give me a kiss. Jo! Don't forget, four o'clock! Jo, don't forget! Are you ok? Can you get up? It hurts. Are you ok? Where does it hurt? Where? Sorry, may I... No, not now, sir. I'm an officer. Step back, can't you see? Sir... I'm so sorry. - What's your name, sir? - Baptiste. Do you work nearby? What happened? Do you work nearby? Does it hurt somewhere? WRECK OF A STAR? They don't pull any punches. It's my fault. It's not your fault journalists are assholes. Come on, Lou! We do exactly the same. No way. Are you kidding? Not to a colleague. This headlines appalling. We're here now. With every French Channel waiting outside. - May I? - No. No photos. I said to come discreetly. - Make your mind up, Lou! - What? - You're not logical. - What? I have to see the family, I have to apologize. Want me to hide now? I never said that. Not at all. What do you mean'? Ladies, follow me, please. Anyway... C'mon now. Let's go. We're here now. We watch every day on TV. Thank you. Salam. You're like on TV. Thank you so much, Madam France. It's an honour for us. Thank you. Thank you so much. Ok, Baptiste? I have a dislocated kneecap. Yes, it's very hard, seeing Baptiste in the hospital. But it's only dislocated... I'm entirely responsible, you know. Know what? I'll come to see you. Yes, I'll come back and... My assistant will take your details and I'll look after Baptiste. Ok, Baptiste? Let me take your address. Spending Christmas with them? I'm kidding. It's just a bit weird... Any comment? - An autograph, please. - Just one. How is he? - Please, Lou. - I'll call you. The leeches. You're seeing Chidiac in an hour. Want to stop in the Marais first to get Joseph a cake? What's wrong, France? What is it, honey? What's going on? A chocolate cake or strawberry? I think he liked strawberry last time, Joseph. I'll get strawberry. I feel I have a mission. Through my gaze, I can show a certain vision of... of conflicts and... So why do you feel this need to be in the spotlight? We see you a lot. You're present on screen Throughout the report. Yes, well, that's... A form of staging? I wouldn't call it staging. It's my style. It's the way I... The way I do my reports. I aimed for a more sensitive approach. It's all subjective. I had to meet These people and have a human contact. Perhaps that's why people like my reports. Before you go, a word perhaps about a recent accident that you caused? Can you tell us more? How is the young man doing? Sorry, I can't talk about it. It was an accident. I knocked someone over. - France, I didn't mean to... - Thank you. Some questions shouldn't be asked. Let's be. more consensual... I was Chouchou's guest and I snapped. I'm so ashamed. No shame in it. It's human to snap. I snapped live, in front of everyone. In front of her guests. It makes you more human. More human. They'll soon forget. Sure. I promise. Just stay off social networks. It's not the end of the world. No one's safe from snapping. You no more than another. No less. What? No less than another, not more. Damn, I've sent it now. Yes, no less. Good news. I'm doing a live show for my book. That show where you... went off the rails. I'm pleased. Your so-called sovereigntists love Europe as we do, but not a technocratic EU. - How can you forge... - They reject it. If this carries on... If it carries on like for the last 25 years... What is a European alliance of anti-EU parties? They don't oppose the EU, they want to change it. They want an EU of projects, peoples and nations. They reject it. An EU of peoples and nations. That's the EU we want, with those you call sovereigntists. You have no other-wand. You're stuck in your conventional categorization. Very good. I think our viewers get the message. Good night. Till tomorrow, same place, same time. Pretty heated. It was good. Are you ok? Yes, I think so. - It was acrobatic, but good. - Acrobatic? Lots of periphrases. Simple sentences are for demagogues. Even if it confuses voters? Voters or viewers? Is there a difference? You journalists never change. Laying into journalists now. You startled it. What? It's funny, as soon as we criticize a journalist... Journalists' demagogy surpasses that you accuse politicans of. You want figures, we seek voters. So? So, we're the same, but you focus on profitability. So keep your lectures for your useful idiots. In any case, up close, you're useful but pretty. Great! Fantastic. Just what we wanted. - What? - He tore me apart. What? He called me useful but pretty! What's is it? - What's wrong'? - A panic attack. Breathe slowly. It'll be ok. Breathe. I feel dizzy. - What's going on? - I don't know. You're dizzy, is that it? Got a Lexomil? No, not on me. It'll be ok, we'll go to Dior for the jewels and dress. You'll be fine. It'll be ok. Better now? I called the press office. They'll lend you the yellow dress. That yellow lamé one. They have your size. You'll look fantastic in it. Come on. Let's go. I told the embassy you're a vegan. They're having ortolans and that's gross. - You can change it. No, it's good. He doesn't have any green T-shirts. He likes it. Maybe another colour? No, it's good, green is good for him. Thank you, Madam France. It's an honour. Seeing Madam France for real in our home is an honour. We're very happy. My husband is shy. - Very happy. - Of course. How long is Baptiste's convalescence? Three months' leave, in theory. Three months' leave? Sick leave. He'll stay here at home. Baptiste works? Usually, he works. But not after the accident. He has to stop three months. Ok. And do you work? I'm unabled and my husband's unemployed. "Unabled", you mean disabled? Ok. Your husband's unemployed? How will you get by? We'll manage. With my husband's benefit, we'll manage. Why didn't you tell me Baptiste provided for the family? That's not clone. It's an honour to see Madam France here. My husband feels the same way. I hadn't... fully realized... the consequences. I'll compensate you. - No... - I'm happy to. Really. - No. - I'm happy to. That's too kind, ma'am. My husband says no. - It's all right. - No, thank you. Use it as you want. That's very kind of you. I've never given money to charity so that I could give one day to someone close. Thank you so much. I'll kiss you goodbye. Thank you. Goodbye. It's an honour. Bye, Baptiste. See you soon. Goodbye. Look.. Look, she's going. Over here, France! Thank you, France. The golden age of nations is over. Nations have lost their authority for good. CEOs of transnational firms, financial market deciders, economic operators, we must impose ourselves and replace them to emphasize our priorities. With the sponsorship I request, #1 you can see our goal is to build a new social-political order on a worldwide scale. I thank you warmly for helping. What a speech! What a chairperson! Such conviction! Her words were simply extraordinary. I'm sure that everyone here, our friends around this table, donors, philanthropists, bankers, financiers, are in total agreement with everything she said, down to the last detail. Who among you has ever wondered, "What is capitalism?" Capitalism is the gift of oneself to others. It means striving for virtues, both moral and spiritual. We approach the spheres of fulfilment, redemption and salvation for oneself and also for others, dear lady. Believe me, we must give, A We must give and keep giving. You won't run out of money, we're so rich. To die well, one must die poor. Once you're dead, your kindness will remain. Excuse me. Madam France de Meurs? May I ask something? I watch you every evening, but I wonder... Are you right or left-wing? What difference would it make? It's important to know, isn't it? Really? Sorry, I adore you. May I have an autograph, please? Excuse me, do you have a pen? Who's this? It's high time you called me. It's set for tomorrow... This is new for me. I feel that I wanted this fame but now I... I can't bear it anymore. I can't bear people's looks. I can't stand my husband. It's hard looking after my son. It's very painful. I'm very unhappy. I should be happy but... I'm unhappy. Do you understand? I'll go now. Next week? Same time? Come on. Watch out. Shit, that hurts! Be careful. Let's do it here. - Ok? - Just a sec. - But above all snipers... - Hold on! But above all snipers staked out here to kill the exhausted population. - Got that? - Come on, hurry it up now! Come on, Lolo. Move ahead of me! Get me the shots! I want the ruins. Go on. That's good. Go on now! Me now. Got me? Wherever we go, images of war are the same. Those of tragedy and desolation. Wherever we go, images of war are the same. Those of happiness... I'll do it again. Wherever we go, images of war are the same: Those of tragedy and desolation. Wherever we go, images of war are the same. Those of tragedy and desolation. Let's go! Is this ok, Lolo? Are you ready? We move through the martyred city where only the survivors keep on living in a zone that the regime aims to eradicate in spite of its people. Got that? Come on, Lolo! Ready? Every day, civilians, children, men and women die under the bombs, victims of their own regime. - Got that, Lolo? - Yeah. Ok, that's it. Let's go! Watch out when you jump in. Yes, Fred? Can you hear me? Are you ok? Yeah, I'm ok. Yes, 3,000 euros. So? What is this? You piss me off for 3 grand? I'm on a continent away doing a report, in a war, and you go nuts over 3 grand? Aren't you ashamed to call about that? Asshole. Ok, Abdul? I'm ok. Well done today. You wage all great. What's so funny? Great? - Yes. - Really? Great for not dying? I mean... Efficient. Efficient sounds better. Ok, not great. What do you do when you're not interpreting for reporters? The war. No choice. And once the war is over? Architect. That was my jog. Really? Now, that's great. There'll be a lot to rebuild. Everything to rebuild. I never imagined you an architect. I imagined you an interpreter. You lack imagination. Something to drink? What are you drinking? White wine. I'll have the same. It's quite a country. I gave that money away. Gave it, away? To the family of the boy I knocked down. Why? Why do that? To make up for what I did. We have insurance! What do you care? 3,000 euros is nothing! Nothing? What can I say? I don't need to answer! It's my money! It's not yours, it's ours! Our money? I make five times what you do! True, you make five times more. My bad. I'm so dumb. I'm not profitable enough. - Fred! - Enough! You make five times more than Dad? Stay out of it. You owe me five times more pocket money. In any case, I'm sleeping at Jordan's. Bye. At Jordan's? Wherever we go, images of war are the same. Those of tragedy and desolation. We move through the martyred city where only the survivors keep on living, in a zone that the regime aims to eradicate in spite of its people. This report shot two days ago shows a hidden war or rather how a regime kills its own people, its men, its women, it's children, its blood. General de Lavoisière, you commanded a French army unit in Rwanda. Does an army kill its own people? I recall Bertolt Brecht once wrote, "If the people and the party disagree, dissolve the people." She's fantastic. She's so talented... So why's she stopping? Well, because... Artists do that. She's stopping... She'll... She'll reinvent herself, see. That's the game... That's why she's fantastic. ...or accomplices of the enemy and that's that. What can you add to that? We're seeing the extreme radicalization of a regime taking a path similar to cases observed in the past with fascism or totalitarianism. She does things that... You don't understand, but it's brilliant. An interesting light shed on dictatorial regimes' strategy that never changes. Gentlemen, thank you. Now I want to say something... I have decided to leave the TV world. Thank you for being so loyal. I'm starting a new life. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. What a moment! Ok, let's see... The Net's exploding. Fantastic. What a bombshell! She's amazing. I imagined you differently. You could look at me. We're equal here, no VIPs. We're here to help people. Where do you think you are? It's that TV star. Feeling sad. Why are you cf tying? It's cos she's unhappy. Why are you crying? You're beautiful anyway. France is crying. France cries now? Apples for me? I can't bite it. You can bite it though. Bitch! You're that TV chick? France, what is it? Come on, that's how it is here. Just do it. And no crying. Is the scooter allowed here? Outside, it'll get stolen. Are you pleased? Very pleased. It's a beautiful scooter. A nice colour. My son will be jealous. I get one, he doesn't? He's too young. - A tiny motorbike? - He has one. Ok, he won't be jealous. You're not on TV anymore? I quit. WW did you quit? I'd like to be a TV star like you. Everyone looks at you, knows you... Posters everywhere. Autographs are good. People see you, they turn to you, call you... It's good being famous. No, not always. - I'd like it. - Hello, France. Awesome, everyone knows you! I don't get it. You want to quit. May I? I adore you. I want one too. What a beauty. - See what you make me do? - You're beautiful. A pretty smile like that... if brightens your face. It's beautiful. Why be sad with such a smile? Look. Don't be sad. Ok, I'm gonna ride my scooter. France de Meurs? You are France de Meurs? May I? Go ahead. Are you crying? - Why are you crying? - Come on. You'll be fine in a few weeks, understand? Yes, I understand. I gave the boy and his family over 40,000 euros so I understand. Rest for now, we'll talk later. May I? Amazing, isn't it? Magnificent. I've come here for treatment every year for ten years I never tire of it. It's incredible how staring at a big rook can do you so much good. Good Lord, this is so nice. I recognized you, you know. So many famous people come here. Singers, TV people, movie stars! Politicians! Movie stars and singers' mistresses. You shouldn't be here. Come for your treatment. Time for my treatment. I admire you so much. Let's go. Madam France, how's it going? Just great! Thank you. All the beauty of the world. Recognize me? The beauty of the world. All the beauty of the world. You're dressed differently. - May I? - Yes. An English writer discovered the world's beauty on seeing the Alps as a child. Who's the writer? Oh, you know... And you are? What's your name? You don't know who I am? Why should I? This is new for me. I'm a journalist. - What paper? - On TV. I don't have a TV. That's good. I'm Charles Castro. Delighted. I teach Latin. Wonderful. A dead language... This place is nice. A nice clinic. Do you come often? No, it's my first time. And you? My first time too. You don't seem depressed. You neither. They cure you in four weeks here. Not bad, huh? Not bad. Excuse us. May we take a photo? Yes, go on. Are they relatives of yours? I don't know anyone here. What do you... What do you want to do? A walk? Why not? Let's stay, it's quieter. All right. Look at the mountains. I bet they're happy gazing at us. You're quite a character. Without repetition, isn't life always the same? Yes, I like the place. It's a nice change. I feel less boxed in. People's looks intimidate me. But I try to face them. Because... Because they send me back to something I'm not. Not anymore. I no longer feel the desire... for that. I want to be... transparent. Yes, that's it. I want to be anonymous. Loving myself like that. I love myself as much and... And it's all wrong. My self-esteem is excessive. You understand what's happening to you in your mind. Yes, but my heart is sick, doctor. I'll see you again tomorrow. - I was waiting for you. - Why? - For that walk. - Right. - Yesterday's. - Of course. I like your hat. - I'll get changed. - Ok. - Charles... - Here. - I'm slipping. - Careful. I feel free here. - It's beautiful. - Very. - I'd like to walk on the ice. - If we can. But it breaks. What do you want me to say now? Tears in my eyes as I keep weeping now What do you warn' me to say now? That's what you want To see me cry now What kind of music is that? A mediaeval song, in Latin. Really? It's breautiful. - What's it about? - The end of the world. The apocalypse. Are you ok? - Yes, and you? - I'm good, thanks. I'm late. That's ok. - My class is in five minutes. - Already? I've been here 20 minutes. - Forgive me. - Really, it's ok. What are you doing? - Nothing. - Nothing? I feel guilty. Why? I have to go. Your article on France de Meurs is dynamite! I'll call you. How could you do such a thing? Lie to me from the very beginning? I didn't know we'd fall in love. In love? I must be dreaming. You utter bastard. Stop, France... A journalist posing as a patient in a clinic... How cruel is that? How could you come up with such an idea? It wasn't my idea. That sick act you put on, those dumb kisses, that dumb walk together... Your dumb words. That whole dumb performance. It's revolting. It's inhuman. Inhuman? Yes, inhuman. You make love to me for an article. I love you, France. Shut up! Don't talk about love, bastard. I'm sorry. Take back those stupid words. Never say that to me again, jerk. You planned it all, schemed it all. You charmed me to reach your goal. Kissed me, fucked me! And now you're sorry. You're sorry! Not one word or gesture could mend what you did! You hear me? What a bastard, bedding you at the spa. That's sick. For what? Romantic mystification? - Romantic what? - Mystification. It's your private life after all. He's just a journalist doing his job. No, I'm sorry, not just a journalist doing his job. He's rotten. The guy's a narcissistic pervert. There are decent men too. Really? I don't know. That's what I get for cheating. For seducing... That's different. I'm going back on TV. - What? - Yes. - Are you kidding? - No. That's fantastic! People will love a comeback. You leave, you return... You look so good! You'll come back... It'll be beautiful. You'll some back a winner. It'll be amazing. People will adore it. Do you realize? You're all mysticated up, you come back, and boom! It'll be fantastic. I don't believe it. Can we talk, France? Is that him? I'll leave you. No, stay. I truly loved you. Reject me, but not our love. I'm mad about you, France. He destroys me, yet loves me. Let's go. Screw it, the teachers hate me. I get bad grades even for correct answers. Try what? I don't know. Surely you realize... You repeat the year, you don't listen, you don't work... I don't care. It's important though. No. Honestly... The world won't end. 5/20 in art... Jojo, you love your art class. - Just work, ok. - I couldn't care less. Maybe, but you'll redo the year. I think he gets the message. - I don't think so. - We both told him off. But it's important. Yes, but even so... Call that telling him off? That'll do for now. Have you seen his grades? He may as well repeat the year. The world won't end. The world never ends with you. Look, even you're back from limbo. I'm not back, look at me. Getting back on your feet takes time. I know, but it hurts just as much. The mountains did you good, right? As if mountains could help. The clinic was good, yes. I'm not so sure. I have to live with it. Again? - Hold on. - I'm framed? Look at me for the focus. Danger, danger! It's a drone attack... It's a drone attack with bombs and artillery! Come on! Quick! Come on! Come closer. Get on the other side of me. Stay there. All good? All good, Lolo? We can't turn back. It's getting risky. Risky, but it's an opportunity to board. Let's go. Let's go. The Mediterranean is behind these walls. After a long journey... Got me? ...fugitives flee their land. Shit, Lolo, get face on! Got me now? - We're safe and sound. - Hold on! Close-up! - Ok, look at me! - What's my line? All set. We're safe in the southern district... Shit! We're safe in the. southern district where the people... Come closer, for fuck's sake! Quick, move! ...where the people... Fuck! Why are we blocked? What the fuck is this? Ok, are you filming? Film me here. - Our crew is here... - Hold on. Just a second. Our crew will join a group of men, women and children crossing the Mediterranean and risking their lives. Got that? Hold on... I'll climb On his back. Let's go. - Ready? - Just a second. Ready when you are. Watch the boom. Careful. Ok, here we go. We're joining them to show this crossing to Europe. To show this journey in the full reality of what it represents. We see them daily on TV, perishing at sea... We'll be with them to land on the beaches. I'll do it again. Move the boom. Watch the boom. I'll start again. We're going to join them. We're going to join them. What the hell is our boat doing there? What's it doing there? Jesus... I'll do it again. We're with them, discovering the reality of their journey for this crossing to Europe. After seeing them on TV every day perishing at sea, we're with them. Today, we'll travel with them. The coastguard! Lolo, move it! Lolo, don't film me! The coastguard. This crossing has come to a happy conclusion. In other conditions, people drown and boats capsize. The coastguard saves these unfortunates numb with cold and fear. The fear of sailing on these makeshift boats. The fear of fleeing like this. Shit, I'm lost... Go ahead, climb up. No one fell in. Ok. Keep the shot of me crying. Hi, girls. Don't show the reporters' boat. O, we mustn't. The important bit is when the coastguard arrives. Bring that in quickly. I'll call you back, I have Lou waiting. It'll be fantastic, totally wild. I'm so pleased, the images are amazing. It's not just original, no one's seen it before. I mean, a journalist among the migrants... It's unprecedented. I'll Call you back, Lou. Yeah, later. Why's that jerk here? What's going on? France, you must listen to me! I'll call the police. France, listen to me for once! I love you, France! Get the fuck out! Get out! Are my breasts ok? My hair too? Tell me when. Good evening. I'm glad to be back. First, an exceptional report shot a few days ago. A martyred city by the Mediterranean whose people flee the bombs of an endless war. Flee at all costs, cross the sea to Europe, risking their lives, children, women and men in exile. We know them: the migrants. Here, as never seen before, the story of their journey, to perhaps change how we view them. How we view ourselves. Great launch! Wild. A helmet? A bulletproof vest too. It was dangerous. Incredible, it's like a war zone. Can't you tell? They're firing from all sides. So where are the migrants? Ok, on the boat. Yes, we got great shots on the boat. Every day, like so many, they risk their lives crossing. No other journalist ever did that, you realize? It's amazing what you did, France. What's that other boat? The boat doing the filming was our boat. Ok, I see. You slept on that boat, not with the migrants. You didn't want lice! You thought I slept on the migrant's boat? Those sad faces are beautiful. The children... The children's faces... - It's good, your hair's messy so we can see it was... You're crying? An emotional moment. I decided to keep it. You're crying for real? Of course. Look how sad that guy is! It's beautiful. At dusk. You're phenomenal, France. Who else does this? They look half-dead. It's crazy. Beautiful. Great. We'll be off the charts. I don't have my phone, but... Look, it's crazy! What's that boat? That's the coastguard arriving. Ok, I see. It went well then. No one fell in. No one fell in. It would have been good, but no luck. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It's excellent, really beautiful. Next step, you save the whales. Back to the studio now. Are you ready? Ok, let's go. Tell me when. A report on the reality of people who choose exile and risk their lives to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. Between welcoming them or rejecting them, what can we do? The debate begins after? the break. You're on air! Shit! We have a problem. Are you serious? People could hear us during the report. Are you fucking kidding? We had a problem here. Who's the fucking jerk who did it? Can't they do their job? I don't know. It fucking sucks! Seriously? I don't know what happened. For fuck's sake! What the fucking fuck? How can that happen? Shit! Weren't you watching? Some shitty technician. Ok, but screw that! Everyone's gonna hate me! People complain, that's normal. - The shame of it... - Not at all. It's good, France. It's good. This is a good thing. It's good for you. People will lay into you for 24 hours. Things last 24 hours now. In two days, it'll be just a bad memory. It's good that it's happening now. You'll rise again as a heroine. People will love you. Because you'll rise from the mud. You'll emerge from it and you'll look like an icon. That's how icons are made. They're made of mud. People will hate you, then adore you. You'll be totally covered with shit. Then you'll rise again. You'll rise again in the halo of light of your audience's love. That's what'll happen. - You think so? - Yes. People will love you again, they'll love you even more than before. I have 20 years of experience. That's how TV works. This is totally amazing. It's a rare thing in someone's career. - You believe that? - I swear. The worst is best. Of course. Hello, France. Come in. Thank you. - Hello, Daniéle. - I recognized you. I wouldn't have let anyone come but you. That's kind. You never suspected anything? Never. - A gesture, a word? - Nothing. When you married him 20 years ago, you knew? You knew he'd been sentenced for rape, indecent assault... Yes, I knew that. Several women. And a little girl too. He never said about a little girl. I didn't know he'd done so much harm. But he was sent to jail. For six years. Daniéle... Doing harm once doesn't mean you'll keep doing it. That said... If you don't think someone can change... What do you mean, Daniéle? What do you mean, Daniéle? All the harm that he did... Doing harm once doesn't mean you always will. Otherwise, you believe in nothing. Everyone can change. Daniéle, let's not be naive. Some impulses remain, right? I thought it was all over. It happened 20 years ago. Nothing happened for 20 years. Understand? What's to say he did nothing all that time, here or there? How can you be sure? I lived with a monster. That's what he is. With a monster, ma'am. Let's take a break. That's why we're here, Daniéle. The words have to be said. I told you that. The viewers need to understand what you're going through. Thank you... No one can know what I went through. No one can. Are we good? The reverse angle? - Let's try it. - All right. I redo the questions? Let's see... The first one... Never... I'll start again. You never suspected anything about your husband? A gesture, a word? Daniéle... But what's to say... What's to say he did nothing all that time, here or there? Got that? Seen that, honey? - Seen the photos? - Yes. Seen them? Sad, isn't it? France de Meurs... Let's do a photo, sweetheart. Go and ask her. A photo? It's terrifying. It's beautiful here. Right? Daniéle spent 20 years with a man she calls a monster whom she didn't know. His path crossed that of Sandra, their young neighbour. Daniéle spent 20 years with a man she calls a monster whom she didn't know. His path crossed that of Sandra, their young neighbour. I don't know why I did it, letting you in. It's hard to know, yes. So? So, will you forgive me? For your cruelty? I've known worse sorrows since. That one's trivial. Life puts things in perspective. There are real monsters, you know. So you... I loved you so much. So much... The job was killing me. This crazy fame... You were outside all that. The hell you were. Never mind. My job is my job. I accept it. I take it as it is. And I do my best. Forget a brighter future, progress, ideals... That's all dead. That's what makes us suffer. You understand? Only the present remains. Here and now. Forget all expectations. Don't postpone the present. So, it's now, Charles. I'm going to get some air. Fuck! Wanna get bashed too?
