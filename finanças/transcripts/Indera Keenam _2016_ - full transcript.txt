Don't you know what time is it now? Where have you been? I'm not a little girl anymore, Mom. Have you forgotten? That I've grown. And I'm capable of going wherever I want? Why are you always acting so weird! SHUT UP! Do you have any clue how to behave towards your mother? Do you have any clue... how to become a mother... ...that doesn't act so freaking weird every single day? I always catch you talking to yourself. If you have a problem, we can fix this together, Mom! Rather than you burying it ... and you continue talking to people that aren't really there! But, I see it... ...as if there may really may be something you're talking to. So who are they, Mom? WHO??? - Hi! - Hi! I'll join you. Yeah. Careful! Alex? Alex? Lisa? Lisa! Dina... Do you think I enjoyed that prank? I like it when you're angry. What do you think if I invite you to dinner with me and my mom tonight? At your place? Yeah. Okay. - Okay. See you! - Bye Tonight, OK? Who is this lucky guy? Just a friend, Mom. - He lives around here. - Oh. You made this spaghetti? Yeah. Hmmm... It's really good. Mommy? Mommy? Din... I think it's best if I head home. The spaghetti was good. Aunty... ...please excuse me. Mommy? I apologize... ...for what happened at dinner tonight. Mom, what's up with you? Why do you always have to embarrass me like that? Can you please just control yourself... ...act normal and cause no more problems? Can you? There's something that's bothering me. But... At first I thought it was all just a series of hallucinations. But over the years... ...I'm convinced that what I've been seeing is real. I think... ...you're crazy! I mean... why are you always... What's up? Try to settle the thoughts in your mind. Everything that you feel and see... ...are only products of hallucinations that you construct. Hallucinations... Just a hallucinations... You cannot let yourself be affected by what you see. Hallucinations... Relax... Relax...! Hallucinations... Hallucinations... Hallucinations... Have rest or a few days. Thank you, Doc! Mommy! Mommy, what's happened? What's wrong, Mom? Mommy! Did you have another nightmare? Calm down. I here, Mom. Okay? Here, take this... Slow down. Okay,that's enough. Get some rest, okay? Mommy! It's okay, Mom! Dina...! Don't leave me in here, sweety! I want to go home! Get off of me. Don't touch me! Let me go! Dina... Dina don't leave me. Take me home, Dina! Take me home! Don't leave... Take me home, Din! Take me home, Dina! What? I Miss you. I Miss My mom. I've taken my mom's love and affection for granted. She's given me everything since the day I was born. Now I just feel so alone. And I feel like being an unworthy daughter. Why haven't you visited her recently? Maybe she misses you too. Well, how about you family? Where are your parents? How come I've never seen them around? Their lives ended after a horrific car accident. I've lived with my grandmother ever since. Until she's also, passed. But now I have you. You... The one that will always be there by my side. Din! What's up? What's happened? Mommy? Dina! Hi! Sorry, the door was opened. Hi, Mom! When did your mom come home? Why would you ask that? I thought.. Bye! Never mind. Who did you come here with? Grandma. Grandma? Where is she then? Why are you always following me? Why do you think I'm always following you? Because you're always there. Annoying me wherever I go. Are you scared? Or do you not like me being here? - Scared? - Yes. Lisa? Lisa? Lisa? Lisa? Lisa? Lisa? Lisa! Lisa? Lisa! Lisa? Lisa! Don't touch it! It would be better... ...if you leave this place right away. Because the woman who claims this house does not like your presence here. There was someone who has ever lived here before you. But afterward, only you and your mother have lasted this long in that house. There is no mother would allow danger or harm come in her child's way. Mommy? Mommy? Mommy! Mommy? Mommy? Mommy? Mommy? Mommy? Mommy? Mommy? Lisa? Lisa! Lisa? Lisa? Lisa? What you see and feel... ...it is all a hallucination. And the woman who often haunts you... She was a mistress of this house's owner... ...who was locked in the basement. There is nothing that can hurt my child. Mommy... Mommy... Please forgive me, okay? Give me a chance. I promise I won't let you suffer anymore. I'm sorry, Mommy. I'm so sorry... Wake up, Mom! Mommy, please wake up! Please, Mom. Please wake up, Mom! I'm here, Mom... I'm so Sorry. Dear Dina... One day you will open these pages and read what it holds... I just want you to know what has really happened to me. Because I'm sure... ...you hold many questions left unanswered for me. Right Dear? I never had the intention to tell anyone. Especially you, my daughter whom I love the most in this world. Since I was a kid. I've experienced strange occurrences until I grew up. I thought these occurrences were just hallucinations playing with my mind. And wasn't real. I never thought that I was the kind of person to feel and experience these sort of things. Because I know... If I were to tell you, you would be so scared... ...and would never be comfortable with me. All of this I have contained So that it wouldn't affect you in any way. No one would believe me. I was sure of that. I'm so sorry... Dina, sweetheart... I hope and pray that one day you will understand what has happened to me. And you'll believe that I was never crazy. Love you. Mommy. "There are moments for our comfort and safety... that disturbs our thoughts, without haveing to disturb the life in the supernatural realm... IF, THEY DON'T LIKE YOU, THEY... DISTURB YOU!!! that is not from our world..."
