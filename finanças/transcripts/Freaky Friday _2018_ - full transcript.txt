Come on, refresh. Ellie, nothing's changed. I know, Karl, but when it does, The Hunt is tonight. We have to stay up to date. If anything changes before it starts. Ellie, you've had us studying the list from the last five years. I know them better than the letters in my own name. Ellie, I think we should reconsider doing The Hunt. I mean, I heard there are like super embarrassing things on the list. Monica, dude, you're gonna be fine. What if there's something on the list that makes me phobic? Like dancing? That's a real thing. It's called chorophobia. Yeah, but I'm an awesome dancer. You're really not, Karl. What? You guys, it's our year. We're sophomores. Easy to ignore, flying under the radar. Then boom! We're gonna win The Hunt and break free of the draconian caste system of high school. Now, this is just me thinking out loud but do you think the fact that Adam is the list master has anything to do with Ellie's sudden enthusiasm at all? No! No! Maybe just a little bit? Not true! Excuse me. The power of magic! Ew. Get off the planet, nerd! What? Fletcher, get out! Ok, I'm leaving. Magic freaks me out. Yeah, spit freaks me out. Fletcher freaks me out. You guys, come on. Bracelets up. We can do this. Aaaah! Ellie, have you asked your mom yet? I'm going to. Her wedding is tomorrow. I rented a tux. And you're the maid of honour. There's no way she's gonna let you go. Yeah, she is. She's in denial. Hardcore. You would be in denial, too, if you had to wear a princess dress. I'm asking her today. Mmmhmm. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. We totally believe in you. Wow, oh my gosh, your support means the world. I love and support all of my friends! Ahhhh! I love and support my friends! Colour, texture, scale. You are ready for your close-up. Coffee for the bride. Oh, well hello. Why, hello. Mmm. Mike? Yes? I would marry you just for this coffee. Really? Yes. I thought my cabinets would have counted for something. Mmmm... Oh, guess who got the bid on the Harrison's kitchen re-model? Oh, congratulations. Thank you. Lucky them. Oh, lucky me. Boris! No bark! Good dog. Somebody's been busy. Well, someone is catering her own wedding. Hey, Mike. Hey, Fletcher, my best man. How's that wedding toast going? You practising? Yeah. My wedding toast is gonna be magic. Literally. Ladies and gentlemen, behold this hourglass. One, two... bingo! Oh, amazing! I'm sorry, was that not how it was supposed to go? No. Where's the maid of honour? Hey, Fletcher? For your next magic trick can you get your sister to appear downstairs for breakfast? Mom, I'm 10. She's 16. What are the odds she'd listen to me? Everyone focus! We're gonna go over the tasting menu. Katherine, beware the florist is low on ranunculus. Hold that thought. Hey, Katie, which tie do you like? Hold that thought. Let me show you another trick. I need an egg. Hold that thought. Ellie! See? I told you lootophobia is the fear of scavenger hunts. Monica, you're gonna have fun at The Hunt and you don't have lootophobia. It's real! Hypochondriac. Good morning. Knock much? These are sandwiches for lunch. Did you finish your pre-calc homework? Sure. Good morning, Karl. Feet. Oh, yeah. Good morning. Also, uh, congrats on your nuptials. Oh, thank you. He's being nice. Monica, I love that colour on you. See? She looks nice. You could do that. Are you two staying for breakfast? No, thank you. We better get going for the first bell. Monica, come here. Come here. Let me fix this. Did this jacket just go out of style? Remember your jacket is your outfits... It should make a good impression. Bye guys. Have a good day. Ok, I would never be allowed to interrupt your conversation like that. What? It smells like hot dog water. That smells like feet. And beans. This is toxic. Ellie, you need to bring your gym clothes today, you have P.E. Boris, down! Get down, Boris! Boris, down! Good dog. He always listens to you. At least someone does. Come here. Woah, mom, what're you doing? I just wanna- mmm, I just wanna see your pretty face. You always hide your face. Ellie! Is it too much to ask that you keep your room from being a bio-hazardous area? Oh, is it too much to ask that the little weirdo stay out of my room? Do not call your brother a little weirdo. That sweet, sweet little weirdo adores you. Right.

There's this event happening tonight- Tonight, as in the rehearsal dinner? That tonight? It's a big deal. It's called The Hunt. Oh, no. I know all about The Hunt. Kids stay up all night taking pictures of themselves doing crazy, dangerous things all over the city. Uh-uh. It's unsafe and it scares me to death. Well, it doesn't scare me. Ellie, tonight is the rehearsal dinner and "Down the Aisle" magazine is going to be here. I need to show them that it actually is possible to design your own wedding and I want you and the rest of this family rested for the big day tomorrow. Your big day. Hey! The answer is no. That's it? Just no? No. I'm sorry. Wait, where's Presto? Has anyone seen Presto? Fletcher, nobody cares about your rabbit. Wait, wait. I care about the rabbit. Mike, can you stop pretending that you're our dad? Because you're not! Ellie! Apologize, now! No. There he is. Can you take him to school? Yeah, yeah. Come on, Fletch. I'll see you at 11:30 at the venue. Yes. We'll go over the reception. Alright, hold onto this. Let's go. I hate you. What did you just say to me? I hate you. I hate your attitude.

Oh really, mom? I'm a child? What the... This is not funny. My hands. I just burped up a cheese puff. Mom, my hands! Look at my hands! I have witch hands. I look like I should be stirring a cauldron. Ellie, it's me. It's mom. I'm mom. No. No, you're not my mom. I'm mom. No! You shut it! Eleanor, do not tell me to shut it! Oh no, you are my mom. Oh, look at my hair. Oh no, look at my hair. I have mom hair. I look like a realtor. And I look like a sad, sad little boy. Mom, your skin is so loose. You look like a shar pei. I am talking but it is coming out of my mom's mouth. Look at your- your tongue is really long. My tongue's not that long. And your teeth. Your horsey teeth. Oh, look. I pull it and it just stays there. Please stop. Oh, hey. I got it. We're hallucinating. I know, we're hallucinating. We need to go to the hospital. Where's a phone? Wait, honey, honey. If we go to the hospital and tell them we've switched bodies- Yeah. They're gonna lock us in the psych ward and medicate us until someone writes a book about us. No hospitals, no doctors. Take a deep breath- Oh. And we'll figure this out on our own. We totally broke a magic hourglass. I highly doubt that it's magic. Ok, I can admit when I'm wrong. Mom, there were two. Dad gave us those hourglasses, one for me, one for you. All we have to do is go get yours and we can switch back. Honey, that thing's in storage somewhere- I'll help you look! It may not have the same magical properties- Mom! I sold it. You sold it? But those were from dad. Daddy gave those to us. You wanna forget everything about him. No. It's like he was never here. Honey, it is so complicated. I needed to let go of some things. Ok, I sold it to an antique store that opens in a couple hours, Vintage Antiques. We can get the hourglass and switch back. Vintage Antiques? Why didn't they just call it Antique Antiques? We just have to get through this morning. Who is it? Katherine, I have Danielle Alexander here from "Down the Aisle" magazine. And the photographer. Ellie, we need to answer the door. No, we don't, actually. I think we could live here. Yes, we do. No, mom. Mom. You do not understand. This is very important. We could paint each other's nails. Mom, look at my jewellery. You really don't understand. Delighted. Katherine Blake. Finally I get to meet the bride who's woman enough to cater, design, and execute her own wedding. My own wedding. What I love about this cover story is that it's relatable. Yes, you can have an elegant wedding and yes, you can do it yourself. The proof is in the pudding. Look at you. Look at me. What a charming room. Have you seen the back yard? It's in the back. Torrey, show this fine woman the yard. It's really nice. I will be downstairs in two minutes, thank you so much. I just came from this hallway. I'll be right there. Ellie, I took out a second mortgage on our home to grow my catering business. A cover story from a major wedding magazine will make or break me. If the story happens it'll mean more publicity. More business. More money for us, our family. Got it. If the story does not happen we could lose our house. What? I didn't tell you because I did not want you to worry. Wow. You know, so far being an adult is super un-fun. I promise you we will get that hourglass and switch back today. But until that happens I need you to be me. Right. Yes. Uh, and I'm totally on board with that. Uh, just a caveat, I can't miss school today. Why? Funny. Um, if I have one more unexcused absence I'll fail tenth grade. Fail? When were you going to tell me this? At the mandatory parent-teacher conference today. How can you be so irresponsible?! I don't know. I guess you'll find out at the conference. Ok. Breathe it out, mom. You need to stay here for the interview, so I'll go to your school. Come on. There is no way you can handle a day at my school. Ellie, please. Mom, you don't know how to talk, you do not know how to act, you're gonna be weird and people will think I'm weird, and it will last forever. - You're going downstairs. - No. - You're doing an interview. - No. - You're being polite. - No. - You will be polite. - No. - You will be charming. - No. You will talk about the challenges of balancing work and motherhood.

But also, Savannah's trying to get people to drop out of The Hunt. Ellie, during last year's Hunt, Savannah freaked out a girl so bad that she hyperventilated and then Savannah posted it on social media and it went viral and I heard the college the girl was going to rescinded her acceptance. I'm sorry, that's absurd. That was my sister. Ellie Blake. Savannah. Good morning. Someone said you thought you could win The Hunt? Someone said what? Someone said you, you, thought you could win The Hunt.

My parents sent me to high school with nothing but a burlap windbreaker and an onion for lunch and yet, today, I am a thriving professional who supervises 14 volleyballs so you just watch it! Yo, El. What's lunch today? Hey, I one hundred percent know your name. I hope so, unless you were gonna give your sandwich to another Adam. I give you my lunch? Adam? Yeah. Your mom's sandwiches are the best. You gotta tell her she's like the Albert Einstein of sandwiches. I will tell her. Yeah? Yeah. Awesome. She made those mini quiches today? I- she made, uh, ham and brie with homemade chutney. Homemade chutney. Thank you so much. May I? Well, it's not lunch yet... Oh my goodness, this is so good. I like your hair. You do? Yeah. I like your face. Wow. I mean, I can see your face. Thank you. It's the... The clip. So you stoked for The Hunt, or... Again with the- does nobody care about their grades or standardized test scores? I'm messing with you. Oh. Grades, test... bogus, am I right? Yeah. Uh, seriously though, explain the obsession with The Hunt to me? The hunt's epic, you know that. I mean, my brother was like the school's legendary list master so I feel like I should live up to his hype. I see. I mean, this year I'm list master so I feel like I have a chance to make it about community building and bringing people together. That is surprisingly mature. Excuse me, I have to get to class. You do that. Okay. Uh, Ellie, you know that it's this way. Caught ya. Oh. Ooh. Yeah. That's a good joke. So many. We've got so many inside jokes. Ooh, arugula. She's gone. Ok. Where is everybody? The journalists and photographer went to scout the reception venue, we're meeting them there. Oh, we have to? You're so weird. We should go. Keys! I'm driving. Uh, forgetting something? Of course. Well, Miss Blake. What a treat. Such a wondrous occasion to have you in biology today. You know, they did a study on sarcasm in the classroom and it's actually the least effective way to communicate. Please, sit. Hey. 'Sup? I'm sorry, did you say "heysup"? I said 'sup. Oh. 'Sup. Hey. So um, what did your mom say about The Hunt? The Hunt, right. She said no. Yeah, but you said you were gonna give her some push-back, right? Uh, my mother's under real pressure today. Tonight's her rehearsal dinner. The whole weekend's being photographed by "Down the Aisle" magazine. You care about that why? Look, we just can't do it. The Hunt scares me to death. It scares you? Nothing scares you. Not even coming in second place. My mother says that second place is just another way to say "loser". Oh, honey, I went on a meditation retreat with your mother and she would say no such thing. Namaste. Class, no pop quiz today. The frogs are here. We're doing dissection. Uh, why do we have to dissect today? Hey, less blab, more stab. Come on, let's move it before these things gelatinize. Poor Ellie. I remember last month just looking at the starfish on the screen made you sick. Do you need a bucket? You know, Savannah. Mmmhmm. Today I'm feeling pretty comfortable with a knife. Ok.

The clothes, what's going on? We are so sorry to keep you waiting. We had to make a quick stop. It's a long story. Never mind. Oh, don't lie, Torrey. It was totally worth it 'cause we got this dress, on sale! Am I right? Up here. There you go. This space is so unusual. Very dramatic. Very... raw. Go big or go home, that's what I always say. So the rehearsal dinner will be at your house tonight and then both the wedding ceremony and the reception will be here? Nothing gets by you. And the cake. Katherine designed an extraordinary wedding cake. I nailed it. Hi, can you please bring out the wedding cake? Get the cake! Hey, just chill. I'm ok. I'm ok. So, Katherine, what inspired you to do everything for your own wedding? I'm a control freak. Ahhh. She's so funny. Oh, wow. Katie! This must be the groom. Hi, how are you? Hi. So just- no, stop right there. Hey, fella. Ow. Nothing like a bride with a really good right hook, am I right? You are right. Shoulda seen what she did when I proposed. Oh, it was amazing. Louis. Ok, great. So do you two have something- Excuse me. So do you two have anything special planned for the reception? They have been taking dance lessons for weeks. Yeah, we're pretty good, too. Like Rogers and Astaire, am I right? I don't know who that is. Uh, Rogers and Astaire. Dude, I know them. They're famous. They're great dancers. I went to their concert. Well, great. You must show us. No, we mustn't and the reason we mustn't is because we don't have the music and I am super sad about it but we can't do it 'cause we don't have the music. Wow, how wrong you are. Look at this, the music. No, no. Don't act like you haven't made me listen to this every day for the past month. Let's give them a taste. Nobody wants to see us do that. Yes, they do. Wait a minute.

It's obvious you're at the top of the social hierarchy here. Kudos. But your mean girl schtick? It's infantile. It is? Yes. I'm here to tell you that there is life beyond high school. Wow. That's really deep. You know what else is beyond high school? The dry cleaner. That was a disaster. Category four. It's probably my fault. I wasn't gonna say anything, but yeah. That's in your hair. Hey, I can go to the market and get a sheet cake. They have awesome sheet cakes, the kind with the pictures on them. Now you're just being mean. No, no. I'm being helpful. It's different.

Yeah, and your lunches are amazing. Oh, thank you. I'm gonna catch you guys later. Ok. Ok. See ya. Bye. Do you like him? Would you shut it? Ellie. Mrs. Blake. Right on time. Mrs. Blake. Mrs. Luchenbill teaches Ellie English Literature. The Scarlet Letter. Great read. A page-turner. And Senior O' Bryan teaches Spanish. Buenos tardes. Mucho gusto. Your daughter is... where do I start? No me digas. Pretty good. So I've been looking over Ellie's test scores. Uh, she never tested well. Because I don't study. Or the tests are too hard. Agree to disagree. I think she's a pretty great kid. I could do better. Let me cut to the chase. When Ellie gets bored she skips class. Eleven days. I am very disappointed. Are you? Disappointed in myself, and angry at myself. If I may say a word about Ellie's file and the tests. Those tests are dumb. I agree. Ellie's bright. She's articulate, she has a wonderful mind. She's special. I am? She is? I am? She is? We are? But it seems Ellie grew more challenged about five years ago. The year my- my dad passed away. Just say "died". He died. I wanted to give you your space. I didn't wanna be one of those helicopter par... helicopter children. I don't wanna talk about it. I just thought that after he died, letting you process your own way was the right thing. Maybe I was wrong. I really don't wanna talk about it. Hey, you don't have to. Hey. Guys, I've learned my lesson. Thank you for your time. Young lady, you're not in charge of this meeting. You are absolutely right, sir. What I meant to say was this has been a very instructive meeting and I appreciate the feedback. But- I assure you, the faculty will see real and lasting improvement in my attitude. Your class sounds really boring. Thanks for listening to me in there. Honey, of course. Always. Mom. Oh, how did the interview go? The interview, um, fine. It went fine. Fine? Yeah. I can live with fine. Hey, that was a- a super dumb meeting, right? Um, honey, what were you thinking? Skipping class? Great. Wow. I thought we were just having a moment. Well, the moment is over. You cannot just skip school when you feel like it. We have responsibilities in this world. Ok. Oh my gosh, I almost forgot. Do you have an explanation for this? Ugh! When you're back in this body you are grounded for a month. Blake! Gym, now. No. I- I can't do gym. Yes, you can. These kids today, they think they can live without any responsibilities. I know that's right. Yeah. Just go to gym, I'll get the hourglass, I'll see you at home. I love you. Whatever! Mommy! Hi, nerd face, get in. Quick, I'm in a hurry. Wait, no, no, no. No, no, no! What's happening? Get these boogers out of here! Mom, it's your day to do carpool. Carpool? Ok, ok, ok! Listen! No farts. Guys, come on! Are you even wearing your seatbelts? Are you wearing your seatbelts, all of you? Behave yourselves or I will force you to watch a unicorn movie. Stop it! Stay in the car or you will be in huge trouble, got it? Oh, no, no, no. Out of business? Out of business? No, no! No! My life is over! What's the matter? The store is closed. Ugh! "If you are interested in purchasing "any of my merchandise, That's me. "I have distributed the remaining inventory "to 33 other antique stores." You can go to another store and hunt for it. That is so stupid, there's no way I can hunt for it by myself. Fletcher. The Hunt. If I get the hourglass on the list for The Hunt it will be found. Let's go! Hey! That is not funny! ...One second. Mrs. Blake? Hey, Monica, can I talk to my- to Ellie? Hi. Why have you not returned my text? I lost my phone privileges. Wow. First time for everything. Watch the attitude. Did you get the hourglass? No, I didn't, because Vintage Antiques is out of business. What? Listen, the hourglass is at one of 33 stores somewhere in the city and what you need to do is describe the hourglass to Adam and get him to put it on the list for The Hunt. Honey, that sounds very convoluted. Do you have a better idea? We have to get that hourglass! God! Can you just do what I'm asking for once? Fine. Fine! Presto! I can still see him. So um, did you just call your mom "honey"? Good news. My mother changed her mind about The Hunt. Yes! Dream team. Or nightmare.

But pass and you will go through life a MAAF winner. Fail and you will help put the cones away. But if you fail to complete it entirely, you won't graduate. Line up and stretch! Savannah, I was just thinking. You wanna win The Hunt and I've got some skin in the game. Why don't we work together, as a team? Be on a team? With you?

Now, I was hoping you could put it on the list so everyone's looking for it tonight. That's not how The Hunt works. I'm in charge of its integrity. Integrity. The Hunt is a childish game. I... did not mean childish. Let me explain. No. Don't bother. You're not who I thought you were. El, can you explain what's going on? You're being super weird today! Ok, you guys, I don't have time to explain anything right now. Do you hear the urgency in my voice? I'm focused on getting this hourglass so everything else has to wait! Your hourglass? I mean... what's up? No, it's cool. We get it. When's Ellie coming home? What do you care? I like when she's home. She's awesome. Right. She is. You think she's awesome? Yeah, except I guess she hates me now. Well, you shouldn't bug her with your magic tricks. But it helps me practise my crowd work. Your crowd work? I'm perfecting my magic act for Vegas.

Hey, you want some ice cream? Or you can show me another magic trick. Leave me alone. Ok, I respect your wishes. Stop that. What're you doing? Avoiding people congratulating me for getting married so I don't barf. Katherine! Where have you been? I decided to do the napkins in a lotus fold, I hope that's ok with you- Torrey, relax! Who's even looking at the napkins? Who cares? I care! We care about napkins! That's who we are! She is so sorry. I'm gonna go outside to check the tablescapes. And then I quit! Torrey, Torrey, Torrey, don't quit- What did you do? You guys, good timing. Ellie is ready to go on The Hunt. I changed my mind. She can go. Off you go. Ellie, we have to talk. Today was not ok. What happened? You're acting super weird today. Kissing up to Savannah. She what? You're acting like we don't even matter. We came here to tell you this in person. You don't deserve a text. We're doing The Hunt without you. You guys, wait! Wait! And why would you let your mom wear our bracelets? That's super weird. No offence, Mrs. Blake. None taken. Weird. Katie, I need to know whether or not we have a signed- Woah, back off, handsy. Uh, babe, are you ok? You know what, Mike? I'm really not. I'm re-thinking this whole wedding thing. You are? Yes. Alright, I need to be somewhere else. Mike. Mike? She seriously did not... You did that on purpose. You messed up my life on purpose. Katherine, I just found this note. "Dear mom, you may have lied to me "but that will not stop me from following my dreams. "I will be a famous magician "whether you believe in me or not. "Love, Fletcher." What do we do now? It's ok, take a breath. Take a breath. We'll find him. Hey. Does he have a favourite spot? I don't know, I- What about his friends? Would he go to a friend's- Everyone keeps asking me questions and I don't know the right answers. Katie, Katie, Katie. I'm gonna drive around the neighbourhood. We are going to find him, ok? Ok. Fletcher, Fletcher! What's up, little dude? Hey, you go to Pinewood Falls? Yeah. That's where my sister goes. Do you know Ellie Blake? Yeah, Ellie Blake. That's my sister. She hates me. No way. She called me a nerd. She called you a nerd? That's what my brother used to call me when he was being nice to me. You uh, you running away from home? Because of your sister? And my mom. They're both acting pretty weird today. Mmmhmm. Where uh, were you gonna head to? Vegas. All by yourself? You don't think your family's gonna miss you or anything? I think you're wrong, man. I mean, my brother used to be really mean to me but now that he's gone to college, I mean, I really miss the guy, you know? I guarantee you right now your family probably really misses you. So what do you say? Want me to take you home? Here is his school picture, his hair's a little shorter in the front. Here's a soccer picture. He's not very good at soccer. Um, you should put out an APB. Honey, I need to talk to your mom. What was your son wearing the last time you saw him? A shirt and pants. Beige pants, a white button down shirt with fish on it, tan sneakers, medium blue hooded sweatshirt- Mrs. Blake, could you describe your son's personality? He can be very annoying. Your son is annoying? Don't write that down! Fletcher! Mommy! How did you get back? Hey. 'Sup? : 'Sup? Is anybody else hungry? Uh, don't touch the paté. Do you wanna come inside real quick for something to eat? Um, I should probably get going, so... Ok. Um, hey, by any chance did Ellie talk to you today about an hourglass? Yeah, she did. This morning I broke an hourglass that Ellie's dad gave to me and she was- she was just trying to help me feel better. I- I thought she was trying to cheat, so- She likes you. I like her, too. You do? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Well, you like everyone, though. Sure, I know, but I mean like I... I like her. Like in a particular way? Yes. Like in a particular way. But this is really weird that we're talking about it. One hundred percent. Um... Ok. Alright. I'm gonna get going. Hey, and Adam, if you could help us out with that hourglass and just maybe put it on the list that would be worth a lot of sandwiches. Sounds good. Ok. Cool. Thank you. Bye. Mom, what's the matter? I'm a terrible mother. No, you're not. Hey. Hey. Is Fletcher ok? We heard he was missing. Oh, he's home now. Good. You guys, today I put a lot of pressure on Ellie, so if she acted like a tool... Yeah, she kinda did act like a tool. Definitely. Did you guys just both call me a tool? What? Did you just call her a tool? Don't call her a tool, or me a tool, because name calling is wrong and you know it. It's beneath you. Ok. The point is, can't you just let her back on the team and you all do The Hunt together? Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, young adults. Or we could just quit. I'm sure you've had an emotionally taxing day- No, we're doing this. Get upstairs. I'll meet you there. Ok. Ok, your life and your peer group are both very confusing and the pressure is killing me, so you go. You know what? I would love to go. I have been dying to do The Hunt but it would be totally insane to have a mom do it! So maybe you can dig deep. I couldn't get the hourglass on the list, ok? Adam said no. I failed. I may have talked him into it. So, The Hunt. What do I do? Have fun. Ugh. Act like a kid. Wait. Give me these. Atta girl, you're gonna need those. Wait, take this, too. Hold on. Ah, nuts. I can't even see it. It's better together. Mmm-mmm. Oh, hey Danielle and Louis. Look, my son is safe at home. It's been a crazy night, right? Woo hoo! I'm sorry but this wedding is not a cover story for our magazine. Yes, it is. It totally is. No, it's not. This is an epic fail. What am I supposed to put on the cover? You don't even have a cake. Let's get out of here. Um... wait... my family. I started my business by myself to support the kids and I needed to show them that it was possible even when something goes really wrong that it all was gonna be ok. And taking care of everyone every day. It is super hard. I work, I do all the home stuff. Nobody is making my lunch in the morning. That's all on me. You should put that story on the cover of your magazine. That is way more true than a fancy wedding. I know I'm not the master chef here but can't we just make seven layer bars to replace the wedding cake? What, you don't consider that real cooking? No, but it is delicious. Yes. We are gonna make seven layer bars! As a family! Mom, can I make 'em, too? Duh. Do you guys wanna put on an apron? I like seven layer bars. They are delightful. Get in here. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Wait, wait, wait, Torrey, Torrey, Torrey. I was not at my best today and I should not have demeaned your napkins. Your napkins are great. And you, you are totally high strung and super duper weird but it's only because you do all the unimportant things that nobody else wants to do, and you wanna know why you do it? It's because you got heart and you care. Oh, Torrey, please don't quit. I wish I could quit you. See? You're so weird. So weird. I really gotta pee. Karl, you shoulda gone before we left. Uh, excuse me, sorry. Alright guys, stay close to me. Excuse me, thank you so much. Excuse me, everyone. Can we make a path? Thank you so much. Oh, Karl, I brought trail mix for your hypoglycaemia. Really? Yeah. Thank you. Uh, young lady with the wings? I'm sorry, can we just squeeze- thank you. Uh, can we clear a path? Stop. Cool. Alright. Everybody good? Oooh, look who's out after curfew. Ellie Blake and her team of losers. I don't know, Savannah. I think we're in it to win it. Oooh, I'm scared, girl. Hey, hunters, how's it going tonight? That's right, you already know what it is! Tonight is the night! 20 objects to find, 30 places to go, and 50 things to do! Are you excited? So, as your list master, I'll be texting you a total of 100 things to complete by the end of the night, and the team that gets them all done first, wins. ♪ ♪ Hey hunters ♪ It's list master ♪ Now I've got you on the run ♪ ♪ Gotta give it all you've got ♪ ♪ And don't stop running 'til it's done ♪ ♪ Found the last one ♪ I've got more ♪ Each tougher than before ♪ ♪ And you know I'm keeping score ♪ ♪ So all fall in ♪ You'll know just where you're going kids ♪ ♪ Never where you've been ♪ ♪ So go where you never thought you'd go ♪ ♪ Go way too far ♪ Where the thing you have to find will be found ♪ ♪ Go there go there, ♪ And be where you are ♪ ♪ be where you are ♪ ♪ Hey hunters ♪ Yup list master ♪ Now if you're falling behind ♪ ♪ Take a breath and look inside ♪ ♪ You never know what you might find ♪ ♪ When this highway hits a curve ♪ ♪ Find the courage find the nerve ♪ ♪ To get what you deserve and then fight on ♪ ♪ You only know a place for real ♪ ♪ Once you've been and gone ♪ ♪ Once you've been and gone ♪ ♪ Go where you never thought you'd go ♪ ♪ Go go all in ♪ Where the thing we have to find might be found ♪ ♪ Go there go there ♪ And be where we've never been ♪ ♪ it's not the finding but the searching ♪ ♪ What you find you'll never see ♪ ♪ Not the being but becoming ♪ ♪ Once you are you'll never be ♪ ♪ Not the winning but the wishing ♪ ♪ Wishes end when you have won ♪ ♪ Not the ending but beginning ♪ ♪ Hey we've only just begun ♪ ♪ Yeah we've only just begun ♪ ♪ Goooo ♪ Come on ♪ Goooo ♪ Hey here we go ♪ Goooo ♪ Come on and go ♪ Goooo ♪ On your mark get set and go ♪ We're missing the snowman and the birdcage.

I gotta practise my best man toast. You're excited about the wedding, huh? Yeah, aren't you? It's complicated. I like that I won't be the only man in the family anymore. Hmm. Fletcher, I... Ellie does not hate you. She doesn't? She doesn't. Also, I am sorry for what I said when we were walking Boris today. I'm sorry for this whole day. Mom, we made seven layer bars, I hung out with Ellie's friend, Adam... this has been the best day of my life. I'm tired. I think I'm gonna go to bed. Sounds like a good idea. Big man. Little dude. Well, I was warned. You said that if you catered your own wedding you'd be a crazy person. I just didn't know how crazy, but... I want to apologize for Ellie. For Ellie? You know, Ellie's a pain. She's not very nice to you. Hey, listen Katie, I'm gonna talk out of school here, but you're too hard on her. She can be mad. It's ok. It is? She lost her father. I could never replace him and I wouldn't even try. I need Ellie to accept me on her terms, 'cause I love her. So if she wants to be angry with me I can take it. She's not angry at you. She's... sometimes she's just... angry. And she misses her dad. I think Ellie's afraid she'll forget him. She doesn't need to forget him. No one should. Her or you. Are we ok? Pppbbt. Yeah. We're good. That's good. Thank you. You did good. Didn't see that one comin', huh? I totally did, but that's alright. Alright, I'm gonna go check on the wizard. Ok. I am cold, I am tired, we've been out all night looking for that hourglass. Karl, I'm all out of trail mix, ok? This is what being a trooper looks like. What time is it? Karl, have you checked the leader board? Uh, we're- oh, we're in the lead. Ok, but we still need the hourglass. You guys, the hourglass isn't in an antique shop, it's in an antique watch shop. Come on! Hi, Mrs. Time, I need to borrow that hourglass. This is a joke, right? Woah! Oh! Excuse me. Hello, Mrs. Time. My mother is an attorney and if I don't get that hourglass in my hand right now she will sue you for emotional distress. I mean, lawsuits are so expensive nowadays, right? Thank you. You cannot just steal that! I guess I just can't control myself. Oh, your face would be so funny if it weren't so sad. Let's go. Wait. I can't control everything. I thought if I could control everything I could keep my family safe. But I can't control everything. And we can't control anything about The Hunt, that's the whole point.
