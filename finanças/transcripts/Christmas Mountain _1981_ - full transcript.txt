(donkey braying) - Be good now. Why do you do that? Mr. Findly will be closed if you don't behave. (donkey braying) (stick slapping) Stop that, Pepe. What are you doing? (stick slaps) You're so bad. (stick slapping) Do you want me to beat you? (Pepe brays) I don't wanna beat you. (stick slaps) Behave! (stick slapping) What are you doing? (stick slapping) Why do you do this? (Pepe braying) You're a bad, bad burro! (stick slapping) You come back here. Pepe, please be good. Stop that, Pepe. Why are you doing this? (Pepe braying) Mr. Findly's is gonna be closed if you don't behave. You be good now! You come back here! - We've received the most beautiful shipment of goods, all the way from Saint Louis. I've just piled some down there, at the end of the counter. Why don't you go help yourself, and I'll be with you in just one moment? - [Woman] Thank you, Mr. Findly. - I suppose you want to sell your little bundle of pinion wood, eh, boy? - Yes, sir. - 50 cents, that's all it's worth. Did you bring the list? Very good. I'll take care of this now. You go away and come back later. Isn't this the most beautiful goods? Did you see this? - Oh, yes, thank you. (dog barks) - [Woman] Thank you, Dr. Thatcher. See you next week. (door squeaks) (door clacks) (knuckles rapping) - What do you want, boy? - Sir, my mother is going to have a baby, and she needs you to come, please, as soon as you can. - Listen, boy, I have the people of this village to take care of. Besides, that's too far. Well, that climb is dangerous. And who'd take care of all the people in this village if anything happened to me? - What must I do, Doctor, if my mother needs you badly, when it is time for the baby? - That old Mexican woman, she'll know what to do. Now I'm sorry, boy. I have another call to make before supper. (door squeaks) (door clacks) (dog barking) (solemn music) (horse neighs) (horse snorts) (ominous music) (wind howling) (solemn music) (bell ringing) (suspenseful music) (solemn music) (bell ringing) (suspenseful music) (bell ringing) (solemn music) (bell ringing) (wind howling) (breath hisses) - Well, what'll ya have, cowboy? You must be hungrier than a coyote, if you rode over the pass in this weather. - I am, for sure, ma'am, and I'm pretty near froze. - Yeah, well, this freezin' weather's got about everybody in these parts. - (laughs) Yeah, reckon it has. - Well, why don't you set down there by the stove, and I'll rustle you up some vittles? - Oh, thank you, ma'am. Well, I just followed that big old mountain in the north, and it led me right here. - Yeah, well, that big old mountain in the north is called Christmas Mountain. And it's called that, 'cause some old Spaniard discovered it on Christmas Day, over 200 years ago. - Is that a fact? - Mm-hmm. - Well, it's sure nice findin' some White folks. There's nothin' but Mexicans and Indians, south of here. - Oh, I know what you mean. It's awful trying to keep those foreigners out, especially since the whole country was owned by Mexicans and Indians, you know, for a while, but we do our best. - Well, good for you. - Well, enough of this jawin'. Now what'll you have? - Anything you can fix, I'm gonna eat. - Oh, then supposin' we start out with a big, thick steak, some red pinto beans with chili, mound of fried potatoes, a little boiled squash and onions, plate of hot biscuits, follered by a wedge of home-baked apple pie big enough to choke a horse. - I think I just died and went to heaven. (Flora laughs) - Died and went to heaven! (laughs) Yeah, ain't gonna be much of a Christmas around here, if this cold spell don't break. - Must be awful hard on the livestock. - Oh, they're about wiped out. It's a doggone crisis, that's what it is. - Pity. (door creaks) (wind howling) - Oh, Skeeter, put that on the table, will you? And then get out and clean up the kitchen. Well, now, how 'bout some more, cowboy? - Mm, no thanks, ma'am. I'm too tired and full, right now, to lift a fork. (Flora laughs) But, say, you know where I could rent a good room for the night? - Well, how long you gonna be in town? - Oh, it all depends, a month or so, most likely. - Oh. What kind of business you in, mister? - The cow business. - Oh? Well, it just so happens we have a couple of fine rooms upstairs, $2-a-day room and board. - Fine, just put this here on my bill, and I'll settle up with ya, at the end of the week. - We don't do business on credit here, in Lobos, cowboy. Now your bill's $1.40, room and board payable in advance, $2 a day. - Well, I aim to pay ya, as soon as I get some kind of employment. But I'm as strong as an ox. I can haul water, chop wood, or shoot game for my keep. (dish clatters) I said I'd pay ya- - Dang varmint, come in here... (cowboy grunting) (dishes clattering) - [Cowboy] Doggone it, Flora! - Take that, you varmint! (cowboy grunting) Skeeter, get over to the sheriff's office and bring him here, quick! You lowdown, think you can step in here and take a poor defenseless woman unaware. - Sheriff, Sheriff, she's done it again. Come quick! (cowboy groaning) (head thuds) (cowboy grunts) - Where is he? - You're practically steppin' on him, Luther. He's right there. (cowboy groaning) - Looks like he's been run over by a wagon. - I threw a barrel at him, 'cause he ate a mound of vittles he didn't have the money to pay for. He's a thief, and I want him locked up. - It's a few days till Christmas, Flora. Where's your charity? - Never knew a cowboy worth a plug nickel or a Texan worth a hill of beans. - Come on, Skeeter, give me a hand, please. (door clacks) (dog barking) - I want... I must sell my burro Pepe. - I have no use for donkeys or burros. Besides, yours is evil-tempered. There's no market for such animals. But because I feel sorry for your poor mother, I'll give you $5. You can take it out in merchandise. (horse snorts) (solemn music) (knuckles rapping) (dramatic music) (knuckles rapping) (dog barking) (solemn music) (dramatic music) (knuckles rapping) (Dr. Thatcher coughing) - [Man] Good morning, Doc. (somber music) (Pepe braying) - Goodbye, Pepe. (somber music) (cards clattering) (coins jingling) (Mr. Findly coughs) - One to you. - Mm-hmm. And again. - Okay. - Did you see that shepherd kid, today? - Yes. I gave him a good price for his worthless donkey. - Well, it is almost Christmas. - Not gonna be much of a Christmas if this cold spell don't break. - God works in wondrous ways, His miracles to perform. - Mm-hmm. - I think someone should do something wondrous for that poor shepherd family up on Christmas Mountain, woman being a widder and all and havin' a baby, soon. - Well, they should go back to where they came from, if you ask me. - Well, they can't hardly go nowhere, till that baby's born. - Both of those poor women losing their husbands in that avalanche, last year. My prayers go with 'em. - If you ask me, I think we should put together a goodwill Christmas package for them poor folks. - Why? - Because it's Christmas, Findly. That's why. - It would be a worthy, charitable gesture. - Well, what would we put in it? Old clothes and things that we don't use or need anymore? - Yeah, and some day-old bread. Those folks'll eat anything, I expect. - But who's gonna take it up there? - Since you got the best horse in town, Sheriff, why don't you go up to the mountain? - And who would patrol this valley, if my horse slipped on that icy mountain path and broke a leg or somethin'? (coins jingling) - Two bits. - Well, can't any of you make the sacrifice? (Flora sighs) After all, bread cast upon the waters returneth a hundredfold. - Why don't you do it, Reverend? You're the natural choice. - (coughs) Well, I, uh, naturally, would like to do it, but I have to prepare for the Christmas service, and I have to direct the children's pageant, and, uh, what about you, Brother Findly? - Oh, if I locked up the store for a day, I'd be out of business. (Flora snickers) - [Reverend Thorndike] Flora? - Oh, it's too tough a trip for a woman to take. Besides, I'm in the same shape Findly is. (cart rattling) (Flora coughs) - Say, how 'bout the cowboy? Why don't we chip in and pay back what he owes to Flora and send the cowboy up to the mountain? - (laughs) You mean he goes up there or he stays in jail over Christmas? (all laugh) - I don't cotton to payin' other folks' debt. That's against my principles. - Shoulda guessed. - For heaven's sake. - After all, it is Christmas. - That is no excuse for doing something foolish. - You old goat. - Please, Brother Findly, please! - Very well, Reverend, I'll contribute two bits and not penny more. (Flora sighs) - Bless you. - Then it's settled. We'll send the cowboy. - When do you want me to leave? - Now. - All I have to do is just go up there, and I can clear out of this godforsaken country? - That's right. The sooner you're out of my town, the better. - That suits me just fine. (bright country music) (solemn music) (horse neighs) (upbeat music) (somber music) - Coffee? - Thank you. Listen, ma'am, this wasn't my idea. - Well, why do you come? - Well, them townspeople let me out of the pokey, so's I can come up here. - Pokey, what's pokey? - It's a jailhouse, ma'am. - Oh, (speaks in foreign language). Did the doctor say he was coming before the baby arrived? - Nah, that doctor, none of them townsfolks is going no place outside of the range of the dinner bell. - Oh, Lupe. (Teresa speaks in foreign language) (Lupe speaks in foreign language) - Why they do this? - It's for Christmas. It's to make 'em feel good. - By doing this, make 'em feel good? - I don't rightly know, ma'am. It has somethin' to do with the Bible, I reckon, give to the poor and the less fortunate and such. - But we're not what you say poor. - Well, you ain't exactly rich neither. - Please, uh, you may eat with us. We have good food. - No thanks, but I do need a place to bed down for the night. I'll be leaving at sunup. - You can sleep here. - I'm a cowman. I don't sleep in sheep folk's cabins. But if it's all right, I'll just bed down out there, in the shed. - (laughs) You will freeze to death in that shed. - Maybe, but I got no other choice. Listen, ladies, I can't much blame ya for bein' a little out of sorts over them hand-me-downs. But like I said, them townspeople just wanted to make themselves feel good at Christmastime. The truth is, they couldn't care less whether y'all lived or died. Well, thanks for the coffee. Good night. (wind howling) (door clacks) (Lupe speaks in foreign language) (Teresa speaks in foreign language) - It's his own fault, Teresa, if he's frozen by morning. You make your own destiny in this life, but of all the creatures in this world, men are the most stupid. They'd rather die if they don't have their way. - He is not bad, this one. - Ay, Teresa, you're innocent. Do you know that life is like a, like this water jug. What you put in, that's what you get out of it. If you don't put nothing, you get nothing. But if you put love and kindness and friendship, that's what you get out of it. (gentle music) (animal howling) (sheep bleating) (animal howling) - What you got here? - It's a stew. It's Basque. - Tell me. How come you speak good English when everybody else around here speaks foreign? - I was born here. - Oh. Uh, what's in this here Bast stew? - Lamb, vegetables. - I don't eat mutton, boy. - Why? - Cowmen don't like sheep. - Why? - 'Cause cows and sheep don't mix, that's why. If a cow goes near grass where a sheep's been, won't eat it. - That's not true. - It is so true. And sheep graze on land that ought to be for cattle. Cowmen have had to drive sheepherders off their land ever since I can remember. - I know that they get along fine together. - You do, huh? How come you know that? - My mother told me that, in our country, she saw cows and sheep eating peacefully together. - Oh, she told you that, did she? - My mother has seen them. - She has, huh? - Yes, and my mother does not lie. - Yeah, well, you get to bed before you catch your death of cold out here. (sheep bleating) - What's it like to be a cowboy? - Cowboyin' is a good life, but it's a rough one. But if you don't own your own cows, you can't make no money at it. Now you get to bed. - Yes, sir. Will you have Christmas with your family? - I ain't got no family. - With your friends? - Boy, you got more questions than a dog has fleas. I ain't got no friends, neither. Well, I had a friend once, but he died on me. Got himself killed in a stampede, about a year back. Now I ain't got nobody. And that's the way I like it. - I'm sorry. - Well, there ain't no cause for you to be sorry. Soon as it's daylight, I'm clearin' out of this godforsaken sheep country. Now you get to bed! Or I'm gonna beat myself, gettin' up. - I'll leave the stew. Good night, there is a blanket in the sled. (door clacks) (animal howls) - Might as well eat the doggone stew. I'm liable to kick it over, tonight, and spill it all over me. - Mother Mary, bless Lupe and Mama and be with her when it is time for the baby. And Blessed Mother, I pray the baby will be perfect, as you are perfect, and that Mama will not be in too much pain or afraid. Bless Pepe. I pray that he is being fed well and that he does not miss me too much, and I pray for this stranger. Please, give him a vision that he may see something good in the world and know that he was not alone. Amen. (horse whinnies) (solemn music) (horse neighs) - [Man] Howdy, partner. (laughs) What in the world are you doing, way off, up here? Man, this is a long ways from cow country. - Murf? Is that you, Murf? - [Murf] Oh, it's me, all right. - Well, pardon me for sayin' this, but I though you's... - [Murf] Rode across the great divide? (laughs) - Yeah. I was even at your buryin'. - [Murf] Hope you don't mind if we change the subject. I (laughs), you know, I got a proposition I wanna talk over with ya. - All right, shoot. (horse neighs) (dramatic music) Where are your wings and your halo? - Oh, uh, I ain't got all my equipment yet. That's what I wanna talk to you about. - Then you ain't exactly an angel, right? - Oh, I'm an angel, all right, but on a kind of a low, unofficial sorta level. Ya might say I'm a tenderfoot angel. You see, I never had enough points to get me a complete outfit, so I'm doomed to just wander around down here till I can make somethin' real good happen. - Well, I'd sure like to help you, Murf, but I'm in kind of a fix myself, right now. - Yeah, I know. You've got even worse marks than I have. Boy, I'd work on that, too, if I was you. You know, I drank a lot and cussed when I was down here, but I never stole no money off of nobody. - You know about that, do you? - Yeah. You took them cows from Old Man Willis, and then you went and sold 'em and took the money and buried it in a coffee can, down near Goliak, told him that you was robbed. Why, you know, you get almost as bad of marks for lyin' as you do stealin'. - All right, Murf, you got me. You got me dead to rights. Now you just tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it. - If I was you, I'd start in, right here and now, with them nice people that you've been so doggone ugly to. You know, if it wasn't for that little old kid, you might not have got this chance at all. - How do you mean? - Do you know he said a prayer for you, tonight? - He did? - Yeah, and children's prayers are mighty powerful medicine, up yonder. Why, they get action real quick. That's why I'm here. Well, good luck, boy. I'll probably be droppin' in on ya, from time to time. - Murf! Before you go, tell me somethin'. Have I got a chance? - Of course you got a chance. I mean, if you didn't have, why, I wouldn't be here. But it's sure gonna be an uphill climb, all the way. And you'd better give it your best shot. - I will. I will. And Murf, one more thing, what's the other place like? - Well, I don't truly know. But I'm beginnin' to believe that it's just bein' on the outside, lookin' in, not really belongin' anywhere, anywhere at all. (horse neighs) (horse snorting) (horse nickers) (Teresa speaks in foreign language) (Lupe speaks in foreign language) (Teresa speaks in foreign language) (Lupe speaks in foreign language) (Teresa speaks in foreign language) (Lupe speaks in foreign language) (ax thudding) (Teresa laughs) - Hey, Julio! Come over here and give me a hand, boy. We're wastin' daylight. Come on! All right, come over here, and I'll load you up. There you go. Okay, now, can you carry that? - Yeah. - Wake up. Don't go to sleep. Carry that, go on, take that in to your mama. Hurry up. (Lupe speaks in foreign language) (door clacks) (Teresa speaks in foreign language) Uh, you'll have to excuse me for not introducin' myself, yesterday. My name is Gabe Sweet. - Oh, I am Teresa. - Pleased to meet ya. - Lupe. - Lupe. - Lupe. - If it's all right with you folks, I would like to spend another day up here and see if I can be of some help to ya. - That is very kind. (Gabe chuckles) - Hey, partner, that was mighty good of you to bring me that stew, last night. It sure was good. And that blanket, that just kept me as snug as a raccoon in a hollow log. (Julio laughs) - You will have the breakfast with us, no? - Well, I'd, I'd like to, ma'am, but I don't want to put you all out none. - There'll be enough. Sit down. - Julio, tell me somethin', is there any game in these parts? - Oh, yes, elk, deer, even bear. - Well, tell me this. Is there any feathered creatures, I mean, like wild turkeys and such? - [Julio] Oh yes. - Hey, what if you and me go huntin', today? How'd you like that? That is, if it's all right with your mama. As soon as we get some breakfast, we're gonna take off. You sure you know where these turkeys are? - [Julio] Yes, sir. - Here you go, up you go. (horse snorts) (gentle music) (bright music) - [Josh] I sure am glad you didn't leave, Gabe. - [Gabe] So we could go huntin', right? - [Julio] Right. (Gabe laughs) (bright music) (gentle music) (bright music) - [Gabe] Well, boy, we got ourselves some fine-lookin' country in Texas, but I sure ain't never seen nothin' like this. - [Julio] Pretty in the summertime, too. - I sure bet it is. Be good for grazin' cows. - Yeah, cows and sheep too. (Gabe laughs) (bright music) - [Julio] Gabe? - [Gabe] Yeah? - [Julio] Why do you carry a pistol? - Cowmen always carry a pistol, boy, always have. - Why? - Why? Well, in case they need it, they have it. That's why. - Well, why would they need it? - Oh, in case somebody jumps ya, tries to steal your cows, rustlers or somebody, you're ready for 'em. - Have you ever had to shoot a rustler or anybody? - Well, no, no, I never had no call to, but I was always ready for 'em, if they did. - Have you shot anything with your pistol? - Well, sure, I have. - What? - Well, uh, jackrabbits, fence posts, tin cans, you know, just for practice, just to stay on the ready. - In case somebody jumps ya, right? - Well, you're doggone right. - My father never wore a pistol. - Oh, of course he didn't. That's 'cause he's a sheep man. Now it's one thing to steal a cow, but who in thunder would want to steal a sheep? (both laugh) (gentle music) (turkey gobbling) (tense music) (solemn music) (rifle fires) Got him! Move! - Gabe! You got it! - By golly! That's a big one, look at that! Oh my, we're gonna have Christmas dinner, aren't we? (Teresa humming) Woo-hoo! - [Julio] Mama! (Teresa gasps) (Teresa speaks in foreign language) - Yes, sir, we got ourselves a turkey, and he's the real hunter. He led us right to him. - Lupe, (speaks in foreign language). (Lupe speaks in foreign language) (Teresa speaks in foreign language) - Gabe? Will you stay for Christmas with us? - Well, I don't know. I... (Julio speaks in foreign language) (Teresa speaks in foreign language) - It would give us much pleasure. - Well, I sure appreciate it. Who knows? Maybe that new baby will show up at Christmastime. I sure wouldn't want to miss that. (Teresa and Julio laugh) - All right, all right. (speaks in foreign language) (gentle music) - If you folks don't mind, I'd kinda like to bed down in here by the fire tonight. It's, uh, kinda spooky out there, in the shed. It's cold, too. (wood creaking) - Sure had a nice time, today, didn't ya, son? - Yeah. Well, I reckon I don't have to tell you about that, do I? - No, you don't. - Them, uh, them sheep folks are pretty nice, once you get to know 'em. (Murf laughs) - Who said they couldn't teach an old dog new tricks? (Murf laughs) - You gotta be quiet, Murf. We don't want to wake nobody up. - Aw, shoot, they can't hear me. Only you can. - How come? - Well, it's a kind of the special connection that you and me got. You'll understand it all, later on, if ya ever make the grade. - Well, um, how am I doin', Murf? - Well- - A little better, ain't I? - I guess you're doin' all right. But, boy, you sure got a long ways to go. However, I, I believe you're just about ready for the big test. - What's that? - Well, them townsfolks, down there, they ain't got the slightest notion about the spirit of Christmas. Now I want you to go down there and kind of fill 'em in on it, so to speak. - But, Murf, I'm just gettin' the hang of this thing myself. What'll I say to 'em? - Look, boy, doin' is a lot better than sayin'. Now don't you worry about it at all. When the time comes, I'll be right behind you, backin' you up. - Well, you gotta promise me, Murf. I mean, you gotta promise me. - Boy, angels don't never lie, not even low-grade ones. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend ya. It's just that this is all kinda new to me. - Yeah, I know, I know, boy. (chair creaking) - Well, I sure am... (chair creaking) I wish he wouldn't do that. - Senor, I believe Teresa is gonna have the baby anytime now. Do you think you can go to the village and persuade the doctor to come? If anything goes wrong, and if anything happens to Teresa and the baby, and I cannot help 'em, well, I'd rather die. - Now, now, nothing bad is gonna happen. And I don't want no talk about dyin'. You've got to remember it's Christmas. I was plannin' to go down the village anyhow, and I'm gonna do what I can to bring that doc back with me. - Oh, thank you, senor. Muchas gracias. Muchas gracias. - That's all right. - Senora? - Ah, si. (Lupe speaks in foreign language) (sighs) Ah, si, bueno. Bueno. Gracias, Lupe. Lupe? - Si? (Teresa speaks in foreign language) Si, senora. (gentle music) - Lupe, (speaks in foreign language). (Lupe speaks in foreign language) - Why did you do this? They don't deserve something so grand. They only give you old rags and scraps from the table. In return, and those insults, you give them something, the only thing of value that you have, something that's priceless. (gentle music) - Ay, Lupe. We give what we have, no? (gentle music) - [Lupe] Senor, the senora asked me to give you this Madonna, for you to take it and give it to the people in the village. - Are you leaving, Gabe? - No, I'm goin' down the village. I gotta take something down there for your mama. - Can I come? - Sure you can, if it's all right with her. But we gotta get movin'. There's some bad weather comin' in. And you hurry.

Who will be first? (congregation members coughing) Mr. Findly. - Well, I, um, gave some food to the starving Wiggins family, on credit, which is definitely against my principles. I did not foreclose on the Pearson's mortgage. And I sent some flour and some baking soda to the sheepherder's widow. - God bless you, Brother Findly. Doc Thatcher. - I delivered the Adams baby and said they didn't have to pay me till next spring. I gave a bottle of cough medicine to the Turners, for free. And my wife and I gave some fine clothes to that shepherd family. - God bless you, Doc Thatcher. Flora? - Huh? Well, I took in a poor Irish family, and I only charged them half price for their room and board. I let that cowboy work his debt out, so he could get out of jail. I gave a lot of bread, five loaves to be exact, to those foreigners, up on Christmas Mountain. (Flora chuckles) - God bless you, Flora. Sheriff? - There was this drunken Indian passin' through town, a while back, and I didn't arrest him. And I let that cowboy out of jail. - God bless you, Sheriff. - Oh, I, I almost forgot. I had shoes put on Farmer Perkins' horse, for free. But I said he could pay me later. I fixed his plow, too. And I paid that sheepherder kid more money for his donkey than it was worth. (Reverend Thorndike coughing) - Eunice? Eunice! What about you, dear? - I did some quiltin' for the Logan family, and gave an old dress to the shepherd's widder. - Bless you, dear. And bless you, one and all. Now if there isn't anyone else, we just have a few announcements before we close. Tonight, at 7 p.m., here at the church, we'll have- - [Murf] Cold feet again, huh? - [Reverend Thorndike] Immediately following, the Ladies Auxiliary will serve a box supper- - Murf? - [Reverend Thorndike] Our traditional Christmas service. - Where are you, Murf? - [Murf] I'm close by. - [Reverend Thorndike] Carols will be sung, and after that- - I'm mighty plum scared to death. - [Murf] That's because you ain't never been in a church house before. - Well, I can't do it, Murf. I just can't. - Shh! - [Reverend Thorndike] On Christmas Day, the vesper service will be held at 6 p.m. - [Murf] You gotta trust me, now. So far, I ain't never let ya down, now have I? Now you just get up there and open your mouth and leave the rest to me. - Where prayers will be served for the poor and less fortunate. And now, if you will all turn your hymnbooks to page... (boots clacking) (wind whistling) (Gabe clears throat) - I, um, didn't come up here to tell ya all about anything good I've done, 'cause that'd just be a wasted trip. I come up here to, to give y'all a gift from that little, that little lady up on Christmas Mountain. Now I wanna tell you the truth. Givin' them folks all them worn-out clothes and rotten food, that didn't seem quite right to me. But, um, she must've seen somethin' in it that I didn't see, 'cause she sent y'all this gift, which, um, must've been very special to her. (man coughs) - [Man] Dear sweet, look at that. - Ain't that beautiful? (congregation chattering) You know, all my life, I never would have nothin' to do with sheep folks or foreigners or, or anybody that wasn't of the same tribe as I was, and that's been my loss, (solemn music) because I'm beginnin' to understand that people I didn't like was, usually, people I didn't take the trouble to know. Well, I know now. There ain't no finer people on this earth than them folks up there on Christmas Mountain. And that little lady is gonna have a baby, anytime now, and she needs a doctor, and she needs good friends and good neighbors too. A long, long time ago, there was another little old foreign kid born, way off in a strange land, and His folks was poor, too. And I reckon nobody thought that He'd ever amount to much. Well, we all know now that if it wasn't for Him, there wouldn't be a Christmas at all. (gentle music) (congregation chattering) (bright music) Hey. There ain't nothin' to cry about. I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. It's a fact. We're gonna have ourselves the best Christmas any of us ever had. I promise. All right? Come on. (dramatic music) How much? - Oh my. This saddle's seen a lot of wear and tear. - You won't find a better ropin' saddle in this country. I can promise ya that. - Well, I do not have much use for ropin' saddles. - You know, I really don't need to part with this saddle. Do you want it or not? - Well, I suppose. For $20, it's as high as I can go. - 50 and not a penny less! - 35. - 40? - Sold. You know, that was a good testimony you have at the church. I don't agree with it, of course, but the effort was commendable. - How much did ya give the boy for his burro? - Well, now, that is beside the point. Profit is what business is all about. - How much would it take for me to buy him back? - Well, uh, with the cost of feed and board, I could let ya have him for $20. - You gave the boy five. I'll give ya 10, take it or leave it. - I'll take it. This time of year, I never quibble. (rifle clicks) - [Julio] Gabe, how are you gonna be a cowboy if you don't have a saddle? - [Gabe] Oh, I'll get me another saddle easy enough. Don't you fret yourself up none about that. - [Julio] Why don't you use Papa's saddle? - [Gabe] Your papa had a regular horse saddle? I didn't know sheep men rode on horses. - [Julio] Sure they do. Sheep men can do all sorts of things. - [Gabe] Well, I'm sure beginning to find that out. - [Julio] Gabe? - [Gabe] Yeah? - [Julio] What's in all those bundles that Pepe's carrying? - [Gabe] Reckon you'll find out about that soon enough. - [Julio] Sure is nice to have Pepe back, the best thing to ever happen. (Lupe speaks in foreign language) - [Lupe] This dinner is beautiful. (Lupe speaks in foreign language) - [Gabe] Look at that! Do you think they're the right size? Let me see your foot. (Julio speaks in foreign language) - [Lupe] Oh, that's pretty. - Ah, how... Lupe, this is for you. - Oh, para mi? Oh, gracias, thank you. - Oh! (Teresa speaks in foreign language) A cowboy hat! What about that? Now there's something for you somewhere. - It's beautiful on you. - Wonder where it is. Oh, this. This must be it. - [Lupe] Oh, you look beautiful, oh yes. - Gracias. (gasps) Oh Julio. - A rifle. Thanks, Gabe. (Lupe speaks in foreign language) - Well, you're the man of the house now. It's high time you put some meat on the table. - Gabe. It's for you. (gentle music) It's from my family. (gentle music) (Gabe laughs) - My, my. That's about the finest thing I ever owned. Thank you. I'll, I'll wear it proudly. (gentle music) (knocks at door) - Good evening, I'm Doc Thatcher. May I come in? - [Lupe] Please come in. - Thank you. I heard you might be expecting a new arrival. And I thought I may be of some help. (animal howls) (fire crackling) (Lupe speaks in foreign language) (solemn music) - Ah, Julio. (Teresa speaks in foreign language) - Mama, he is beautiful. What will you name him? - Emmanuel. (Teresa and Julio speak in foreign language) (both laugh) - Emmanuel? Sounds appropriate. Very appropriate indeed.

(guests chattering) (Lupe speaks in foreign language) (lively music) (guests cheering) (guests applaud) (guests chattering) (Flora laughs) (guests chattering) - Brother Findly. - Hey! - Sheriff, no, no hard feelings, I hope. - Merry Christmas to you, sir. Okay, kids, there you go. (women laugh) - It was a fine, fine thing you did, Gabe, putting this together. (Lupe speaks in foreign language) - [Woman] Mm, I'd like another. (gentle music) (children laughing) - Want some coffee? - Thank you. - Nothing for me. (gentle music) (guests chattering) (children laughing) - Beautiful, thank you. (gentle music) - [Flora] You're okay. - Ah, ah, come in. - Hope you're feeling better. - Ah, yes. Ooh! - Just a few, little things there now. - Oh, you shouldn't, really.

It's for baby, right? - Oh, you bet. - Oh. Yes, oh! Oh, it's for feet. - It's so little. - It's good. Oh, it's good. Thank you. Thank you. (gentle music) (guests chattering) - [Skeeter] Well, it would be a bit wonderful. - He's so little. Do they come in that size? (Teresa laughs) - He's small. You want lift? You want? Okay. - Oh, not me. Yeah, no, you handle him. (laughs) - Ah, yes, Emmanuel, yes. - You got your hands full, lady. - Is it hot? (guests chattering) (solemn music) - Well, girls, let's go do the dishes, huh? You can always use a grandmother. Take care of yourself now. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Oh, it's all right. (Gabe chuckles) Me? I never held a baby, before. - Look who it is. - Oh my goodness, he's old and wiggly. Oh, look at him. (Emmanuel cries) He's a sweet baby. - Oh, he smile. He smile, oh yeah! - Look at him, he's pretty. (Gabe laughs) (gentle music) (horse whinnies) Well, Julio, if I can borrow your daddy's saddle, I'll be on my way. (somber music) - Gabe, you are, you are welcome here, always. - We can use another man in this la casita. - Well, I might just take you up on that, one day soon, but right now, I've got some unfinished business, back in Texas, and I'd better be movin' on. - You will come back? - Well, there's not many places I ever wanted to come back to and hardly anyone I've ever wanted to see again, but, yeah, I'd be mighty pleased to see you all again, mighty pleased. (gentle music) (Teresa speaks in foreign language) Ma'am? - Oh, you are, um, angel. - (laughs) Oh no, ma'am, not just yet, but I'm workin' on it. - Vaya con Dios. (somber music) (door clacks) (somber music) (bright music) (somber music) (dramatic music) (horse neighing) - Gabe! (dramatic music) (horse neighs) Gabe! Gabe! (dramatic music) Gabe! - Goodbye, son.

Yes, sir, I'm gettin' all my equipment, too. Yeah, I'm gonna be a full-fledged angel. (laughs) - Things are workin' out all right then, huh? - Yeah, everything's workin' out just fine. - Well, I sure am happy for ya. Say, Murf, uh, how are my chances? Are they lookin' any better? - Oh, boy, they're lookin' good, real good. - Ya think I might just make it then, huh? - Well, I wouldn't be a bit surprised. But you gotta keep workin' at it. - Oh, I will. I promise I will. - Well, now, I'll be seein' you, partner. Oh, by the way, merry Christmas! (laughs) - So long, Murf, and merry Christmas to you, too.
