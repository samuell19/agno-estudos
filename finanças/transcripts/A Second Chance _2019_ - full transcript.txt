Oh, oh don't give me that, come on, man, she fine. She can cook and she likes sports. Brah, look, hey, if you don't want her, let me have her. - Man, listen. You know that girl been my friend for over five years. - Ah, my god. - I don't wanna mess up a good thing. - It might be a better thing if you hit. - Look, sex would just mess things up, man, I don't wanna do that. - Ugh, who said that? - She did. - Ah, I figured that BS didn't come out your mouth. - Look man, I've had my good fill, I'm good. - I bet you do, 'cause you anything like cuzzo, you know I get it in.

(laughing) (light music) - Let me call this boy. (phone ringing) - [Man] Hello. - Hey, Darius, where are you? Are you still coming? - Oh man, would you relax? I told you I'd handle a little business. - And what's this business's name? - Now why every time I tell you I gotta handle business it gotta be a female? - Name. - (sighing) Aight, Natalie, you happy? - (scoffing) Dude I so know you. Look, just hurry up. - Aight. (revving) - So what's your relationship to Darius again? - My other best friend. - Okay, I'm just checking. - Girl, trust me, nothing, okay? ♪ Shorty wavy push 'cause ♪ ♪ She said she need my love ♪ - Did you want another one? - [Daniella] No, I'm good right now. - Yeah that's what they told R. Kelly. Okay, no I'm kidding, I'm kidding. - I hope so. - [Darius] Hey hey hey ladies, hey! - Hey! - What's up? - What up? Good to see you. - Good to see you too. - [Cheyann] This is my friend Daniella I was telling you about. - Okay. So the infamous Daniella is in the building. - Pleasure, nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. - Oh, and nice to meet you too finally. Wow, so, what are you guys drinking? - [Daniella] We've been drinking champagne. - Champagne? - Yes. - That ain't no drink. Hey Fred. - Yes sir? - It's time to turn up, baby. - Oh my god. - All right, whoah whoah whoah, are you coming back here to do stuff? - You know, look, the drinks is on me including you too, lady. - [Fred] Ah, okay. (light music) (water trickling) - Oh my goodness, this feels so good. - Girl, I needed it. - Me too. - So Darius seems nice. - He's cool, he's a really good guy. - Mmm, so why aren't you dating him? - We're just friends. - Excuse me ladies, would you guys like some cucumbers? - [Daniella And Cheyann] Oh yes, please. - Thank you. - Mhmm. Don't friends make the best lovers? - You would say that. - Thank you. - [Attendant] Would you ladies like anything else? - No, I think we're good. - Yeah I think we're good, thank you. - You're welcome, please enjoy, I'll be back in about 15 minutes. - Okay. Darius dates a lot. And I think he's seeing some woman that he calls his regular. I don't wanna get caught up in all that. - So what, he's not trying to settle down or what? - I don't think so. You know, it's always that same story, some man getting hurt by some woman and so he dates a whole lot of women to avoid getting hurt again. - Girl, I get it. I get it. (sighing) - Oh! He's having a party tonight at his house. We should go. I wanna introduce you to his cousin Mike. You'll like him. - Or if he's anything like Darius, I'm sure I will. (snickering) - If anything, he'll be good company. Yeah you never go where it could go. - You're right, you're right. Look, as long as he's not married. - Nope. Single as far as I know. - Cheers, girl. (chuckling) - Mmm, yes. (light music) (crowd chattering) (R&B music) - Oh, look at you looking all snazzy. - Hey. - Hey, give it to me. Ah! I would do that with you but you know, we just met. - It's all good, it's cute, y'all got it. (laughing) - Uh huh. - So why didn't you ask me to bring anything? - Because you always be bringing everything. Look, I just want you to come and see I have some cooking skills. - I know. - Right, if you know then go take your butt over and get some meat. - While you go get us a drink. - Be right back. - I'm sorry. - And the cooking skills. Girl, this man gets more impressive by the minute. - All right. It's time to turn up. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Let's have a toast. To new and old friendships. - To new friendships and old ones. - All right. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Yeah, yep. - Where'd you get this, 7-11? - The Bodega, boy, you can't lose. (laughing) (crowd chattering) - So, Darius, nice party. - Oh, thank you. You know I'm glad you came and enjoying yourself. - Yeah, I am. And the food was really good. - Mmm. - You're a nice cook. - Yeah I could do a little something something something. - I bet you could do a few other things too. - Excuse me? - In the kitchen of course. - In the kitchen. - Yeah. - Oh okay. - Cheers. - Cheers to kitchen diaries? - Kitchen diaries. - Mhmm. - Damn girl. You gonna eat all that? - Yeah, do you see me? - I do. - Takes a lot to fill this up. - Okay. You sure is long, mmm. - And you just my size. You think you could pick me up? - Yeah. I could do that. - 'Cause I need a man who could pick me up. And of course, feed me. - Well, let me get your number. - Okay, cool. - Let me just talk to you, let me just. Let's share this seat 'cause it's cold out here. We got this fire pit. You know I just wanna say I think I'm feeling like a lollipop and you looking kind of sweet. (laughing) You know, and I got another question, how many licks it takes to get to the center, you know what I'm saying? (slurping) - Okay, scaring all the dudes away, I gotta come over here and help you. What's going on? - Yeah, what was all that chitter chatter between you and Daniella? - Chitter chatter, what do you mean? Look, I'm just trying to entertain your friend. Look, ain't that what a host is supposed to do? - Okay, host. She is just fine. - What? Is Chey wanting a little Darius attention? - Boy, please, shut up. - Oh I know what it is. - I was trying to tell you you got this whole Beyonce thing going on with you. - Oh do I? - You know what I'm saying? Don't worry about that. Right here, boop. - I'm just-- - Okay. - You know, making sure my girl is good. - No your girl is fine. Just like you! (laughing) - I know you got a eight by 10 of me in your bathroom. (laughing) Hey, look, I'll come and check on you again but at least try to talk to me. - Yeah, watch out about that chitter chatter. - Everybody, drinks on me, all right? (crowd cheering) Turn up, turn up, it's a party. (R&B music) - Damn, man. Hey, Daniella, she finer than Cheyann. - (scoffing) I wouldn't say all of that. I mean they're both beautiful women. - You gonna get at Daniella before she leave? Shoot, something tells me she was feeling you. - Well actually Cheyann thought you two would hit it off. - Oh nah nah nah, me? I left with that tall drag. - What? Yo, you're half her size. - We made it work. We made it work. - Hah, I bet you did. - Hey, you need to stop doubting my skills. (laughing) Hey but look, seriously man. Back to Daniella. She cool and all for conversation but the whole time we were there, man she was eyeballing you. You need to hit before she leave, I'm trying to tell you. - Nah, nah, nah. Cheyann's friend, I can't do that. - What rule say you can't hit Cheyann's friend? You ain't even a couple! - Look, even if I wanted to, it's too late. She already left. - Darius, you are like the saddest R&B song ever. You pathetic, man. Damn. (hip hop music) - So how do you think Michael and Daniella hit it off? - I really wasn't paying attention to it. - Really? So y'all didn't talk about it at all. - Not really. - So what do you think of her? - I mean she was cool. - Cool? Is that it? - What else am I supposed to say? - I don't know. It seemed like you thought more of her than that. - I mean, she looks like she got it together, I mean she's attractive. - So would you date her? - Where's all this coming from? I mean I don't know about all that but, - [Cheyann] Mhmm, mhmm. - Wait a minute. She say something? - See, I knew. - She had a little booty, but. - I knew. I knew you were checking her out. - I'm a dude, yo. It was right there. Just wanted to, you know. (zooming) - Kevin? - Oh hey, Cheyann. - Wow. - How have you been? - Good. - Long time no see. - It's been a while. - How's your buddy Darius? - [Cheyann] He's fine. - You know I never did understand your friendship. - Understand what? - Yeah it just seems like you guys are I don't know, undercover in love with each other. You just want a minute to yourselves, or each other. - (laughing) That's crazy. He's just my friend. - Okay. - That's it. - If you say so. - I say so. Why is it that men think that two people of the opposite sex can't just be friends with nothing else attached? - Cheyann, it doesn't happen like that in the real world. - [Cheyann] You mean it doesn't happen like that in your world. - (scoffing) Wow. - Considering that you need to sleep with everyone to justify your manhood. - Wow. Same old bitter Cheyann. - I am not bitter at all. You do realize that you cheated on me like more than once, right? - All right, that's my cue. - Yeah. - But I never cheated on you. We weren't together at the time. - Okay. - Just take care, Cheyann. It's really good seeing you. You are still just as beautiful as ever. You know that, right? - Thank you, Kevin. Wow. (scoffing) - Cheyann, honey I'm so sorry, my meeting ran over. This poor guy thinks he's my only client. Sweety, would you send me up a light and sweet please. You want something? - A double espresso'll be good. - [Erica] This happens every single time. - Thank you. - [Erica] Like listen, I got things to do. - [Cheyann] Right. - I could tell him 35 ways from Sunday, he's still not gonna get it. Why, 'cause he's hardheaded. (laughing) - You are funny. Well guess who I ran into today. - Who? - Kevin. - (gasping) No. - Yes. - How he look? - Fine. - Ooh. I always thought you two were so cute together. - Yeah until we weren't. (sighing) - You ever think about giving him another try? - I don't know. He did look good though. - Well you know mama said looks ain't everything. - True. - Although some things are worth reconsidering specially if the person has grown. - That part. - What you got for me? - A new book idea. - Tell me. (light music) - My lady. - Thank you. Oh! This is you? - Hey, go ahead. - This is what you? - Let me hear it. Let me hear it. - Oh my gosh. This is your own business right up in here? - I mean I do aight. - This is nice. - Right? - I like it up in here. - Of course you like it, you got yourself a businessman. - You is talented. - I'm very talented. Let me show you some of my other talents. Come here, come here. Ooh, ooh. - You know what? - I don't. - I'm hungry. - Hey, I'm all you need. I'm a whole snack. - No, I mean to eat. We need to eat. Ain't you hungry? - No, man, we just ate like a hour ago. - I got a fast metabolism. - Well we ain't did nothing yet. - So? I kinda get hungry when I'm excited. - Oh. I got you. You want some mints? - No I don't want no mint. What am I gonna do with a mint? I want some food. You ain't gonna feed me? - You're making this real hard. Okay, let's go eat. - Okay, let's go eat. - Okay. - Yes. (R&B music) - I was texting somebody earlier that we both know. - Okay. - How do you feel about me and Daniella, you know, hooking up? - Well, this is a surprise. - Yeah we've been talking for a minute. - When did you guys start talking? She hasn't said anything to me. And why are you just now saying something? - Well I mean, you know we've been talking for a couple of weeks. I mean she been kind of busy so she probably didn't get a chance to tell you and it's really nothing to tell. - What do you mean nothing to tell? You just said you wanted to date her. - No, I think I said I don't know if I wanted to, but you know, we've been talking and we actually have a lot in common. Yeah, yeah. - Well, we're just friends, so you don't need my permission. And anyway, she lives all the way in Atlanta. How's that going to work? - I mean we can make that work. I mean that's if we wanna make it work. But that ain't hard. - Whatever. - You mad? You see me date several women. - Yeah well none of them added up to anything. She has substance. - So what, this is a competition? - A competition? No. - Well you know y'all black women like doing that. - What? This has nothing to do with being a black woman. And I'm not doing that, especially not with Daniella. - Well all y'all women are crazy. And when have you ever tripped on me like this before? You never did this to me before. - Yeah well I'm not tripping over you now. Look, let's just watch the movie. - You love me, don't you? - No, I don't. Maybe as my best friend. - Are you sure that's all? - Yes, I'm sure that's all, Darius. - Jeez, why you getting so salty? I'm just messing with you. Man. (light music) (birds chirping) (phone ringing) - Hey, girl. - Hey, I'm just calling to let you know I'll be out there again next month. - Oh, wow. You haven't visited in years and all of a sudden you're visiting two months in a row? - Well the first time was for business and this time Darius invited me to come. - Oh, he did, did he? Isn't that just great? - Are you okay? You seem a little bothered by that. - No, no no no, I'm not bothered at all. Just-- - Hey listen, I gotta go. I got another call coming through, it's for business, I'll talk to you soon. - I'm sure I'll talk to you soon. - You got it, bye. (hip hop music) - Darius invited you? What? Hey. - Hey. So what brings you out here to my place of business, huh? - Just curious about something. - That curious that you drove all the way out here and didn't think to call me first? - Just needed to get out the house. Writer's block. - Oh okay. So what's going on? - What made you invite Daniella out here? - I thought it'd be cool to invite her to your movie premiere. - Oh that's what you thought? - I mean it was kind of her idea but it sounded fine at the time. - [Cheyann] Really? - Yeah, I mean Daniella is your friend, right? - Yeah, she's my best friend. And I've had like three or four of these things over the years and she hasn't been to one. She's always so busy with her job and now all of a sudden she wants to come out? - Well maybe she wants to change that. - [Cheyann] Change what? - The dynamics of your friendship. - Our friendship is fine. I do what I do here and she does what she does in Atlanta. - Maybe she's not fine out there. - [Cheyann] What are you talking about? - I think you need to have this conversation with her. - Oh. Okay. So you guys have these deep conversations without me now. - What? - You know, I'm going to just go, yeah. - Cheyann, you acting-- - That's okay. I'm just gonna go. - [Darius] Why you acting like that? - [Cheyann] Whatever. - Jimmy, just. Jimmy? I need us to be on the same page. He needs the entire hour to set up, not 15 minutes. All right, let me know. Okay. All right, looks like that's the last of it so everything is good with the premiere and the afterparty. You do not have to worry about a thing, all right? How's the book going? - It's going. - All right well I need it to be more than just going, you got a deadline to meet. - Don't worry. I always meet them, don't I? - Yeah you do. And that is why you are my best client. You know this movie's gonna send you into the stratosphere, don't you? - You think so? - Oh I know so. You've been paying your dues a long time, Cheyann. Many many years. It's your time, girl. - I'm feeling that too. - Are you? Look, I'ma have a pretty tough time out here trying to sell somebody who don't believe in themselves. - I know. - All right. Oh shoot, I got a meeting in five minutes. Listen. I'm so sorry that I can't be there for you but you know, Cassandra has your back. I am a phone call away. - Thank you. - You got it. Sure you good? - I'm okay. - Okay. Do your thing, girl. (funky music) - You know I'm thinking about moving out here. - What? What brought this on? Aren't you a major account executive at your company? You'll risk all that to move out here? - I don't know. I'm just thinking about it. I could always find another corporate job. I'm not worried about that. Anyway I thought you'd be happy I'm even considering moving. You've been trying to get me out here for years. - I'd be happy. I was just wondering about your job situation. You're doing so well out there. - I can do well here. Maybe it's time for a change anyway. - Wow, okay. - What's that supposed to mean? - I don't know, I never heard you talk like this. You never take chances. You're always the one who plays it safe. - I have to take a chance at some point in my life. Especially if it's something that I really want. - Is there something you need to tell me? - I'm just not that happy in Atlanta anymore. - Why? - I'm all by myself. No family, very few friends and the few friends I do have aren't real ones. None that matter anyway, it's just all getting old. - Are you and Darius getting serious or something? - Well, maybe. - How come neither one of you said anything to me? - We weren't sure how you feel. It didn't go so well the last time he asked you about it. - I told him how I felt. - So how do you really feel? - About what? - About me and Darius. - I don't know. It's your life. - (scoffing) wow. You're not okay with it. You really do have a problem with this. - No I don't. - Yes you do. And you don't have to say it for me to know it. Your passive aggressive actions say it all. - Okay, well damn. I'm not okay with the fact that neither one of you felt I was important enough to let me know something so major. And I'm not okay with the fact that you're taking my friend away. Gosh, all of this is happening so fast, I can't even wrap my head around it. You always want what I have. - What are you talking about? - Ever since I've known you, I've always sacrificed what mattered to me so Dani gets what Dani needs. Even in high school, you always got the guy, always got the outfit first or whatever else you wanted. - Really? We're gonna take this back to high school? - Yeah. Darryl Kennedy. I acted like I didn't like him just because I thought you did. And then you turned around and went to prom with him. - I never knew you liked him. I only went to prom with him 'cause he asked me. I liked his brother. If I would have known you liked him I wouldn't have gone with him. - Well you didn't ask. You didn't then so why start now? - Please don't try to act like you're some sort of victim here. So you wanna go back to high school? I always lived in your shadow. I still do to this day. I'm the friend of famous writer Cheyann Winters. In high school, who was the star of every stage production? Homecoming princess, prom queen? I lived in your shadow, you did not live in mine, so please stop and act like you have some memory of how things really went back then, not some story you've created in your mind. - Created? I was there too! - Yeah well you seem to have selective memory now. You've always been spoiled and selfish, Cheyann, not me. - What? You are the epitome of spoiled. And you still take what doesn't belong to you to this day. Like other people's husbands for one. Yeah you thought I didn't know about that. - You know what? (knocking) (sighing) - Oh, we're gonna turn up tonight, baby, ooh! - It would be you right now. - Well hello to you too. - You know what, I'm gonna just, I'm gonna just leave you two to your wine. You know what, no. I'll take the wine. Excuse me. ♪ Fly with me roll with me ♪ ♪ Just let it flow with me ♪ ♪ Stay with me stay with me ♪ ♪ And you can sway with me ♪ - Miss Winters, let me know if you need absolutely anything, I'm here for you. - Thank you, you're so awesome. - You're welcome. (chattering) - Hi. - Hi, how are you? This is a lovely party, I have to say. - Oh thank you. - Congratulations on your movie. - Oh I appreciate it so much. - Hey, what's up, Chey? - Hey, glad you made it. - I know my bad, my bad. I had a long drive. - You missed my speech and everything. - Oh damn. Well, you know what I had to do. - Well, at least you're here now, right? - Mhmm, mhmm. - So did she make it off to the airport okay? - Yeah I got here there. Everything was cool, smooth, but I was kind of shocked that you didn't wanna see your friend off. I mean was the argument that bad? - I do not wanna relive that tonight, okay? - Come on, Cheyann, this is your friend. - Darius, Darius, please, okay? Let's just have some drinks and have some fun. This night is not about her. This night is about me and my film. My party, my future, right? - You right. - Okay. - Aight. - Yes. - So what we drinking? - Let's do tequila shots. - What, tequila? - Yes. - You trying to get lit tonight? - It's my party. - Hey, you trying to break out Sheba. Hey, Joyce, let me get two tequila shots. Mhmm. - Ah my god. - And have some aspirin on deck. - Where's Mike? - Aw man, Mike saw some girl, man, in a wheelchair. Turnt him on or something. He said he had to go in the bathroom. Here we go. - We'll catch him later. - Ah, to success, baby! (R&B music) (birds chirping) (groaning) (tense music) - Ah, no no no no. What happened? Did you, did we? - Yup. - Oh my. - Yeah we did. - Okay. Darius? Are you feeling as crazy as I am right now? - No, not really. - Not really, okay. What are we gonna tell Daniella? What are you gonna tell Daniella? - Oh shoot I forgot about Daniella. - Yeah, Daniella. - I don't know, I mean, I guess I'll tell her before she gets here. - No. This was just something that happened and it doesn't mean anything, so we don't need to tell her. - It doesn't mean anything? I don't know, I mean. - Does it? - It definitely changes my perspective on everything now. - Okay well you can't hurt her. I mean she's moving out here in two weeks because of you. - No, she's not moving out here because of me. - Mainly because of you. - Okay so what? You care about her feelings more than you care about your own? - I didn't say that, but. God, I can't. I can't live with this. I can't hurt her. She's not talking to me now, it's bad enough and I can't. - You know what, no. This is too much. - Darius, come. - Listen, Cheyann, you're gonna have to start realizing that your feelings matter just as much as others. - I know that. - No, I don't think you do. (tense music) (sighing) (whimpering) (hip hop music) - You good bro? - Oh. - Yeah. - Yeah yeah. - You and Cheyann had it up last night huh? - Shoot, what about you and the one you left with last night? - Nah man. She was too much, I had to kick her out in the middle of the night. Hey look man, get this, on top of that, she snored. - Man these women don't have a chance with you. - You just gotta stay on top of your game if you wanna deal with me, playa, that's it. (sultry music) (bird chirping) - I'll get this one. - Oh no you don't, no you don't, no you don't. I got this one. May I help you? - Hi. Hi, I was referred to by a friend and they said you do excellent work. - I mean we try. - Do you think you could do something like this? - Oh yeah, no problem. I mean is this for you? I'll make it special. (laughing) - That's very sweet, but it's actually for my mom. - Oh, it's for your mama. - Yeah. - Well I'll make it even more special. You know what? - Yeah so is there a form I need to fill out or something? - There is, there is. Give me a minute, give me a minute. - Okay. - Okay. Got this form right here. Here's your, give you that beautiful piece of artwork back. If you could just sign at the top right there and I gotta note beforehand before you sign is that Miss or Mrs. - It's a Miss. - Okay. I'm sorry, it's just that I'm enamored by your beauty. (laughing) - Thank you. - Yeah right there. When will you need this? - [Leslie] Well how long will it take? - Maybe a few days or a week. You know what, better yet, I think it's best if I call you. You know 'cause it's a lot of detail, we can discuss the details over dinner perhaps. - Yes, well there's no rush and all of the details are on the paper. But dinner should be fine. - Okay, yeah. All right, I'll give you a call. - Okay, well you do that. - I will. - All right. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Dang. - Enamored by her beauty? Where you get that word from now? - Oh come on man, don't hate. Did you see her? And that's wifey right there, boy. - You got all of that from that little moment? - Yeah. - Yeah, aight. - Aight. Come on man with the rest, walking dead, let's go. - Listen man, I had a good night. ♪ My heart keeps falling ♪ ♪ Falling down ♪ ♪ Falling down, falling down ♪ ♪ My heart keeps falling down ♪ ♪ My heart keeps falling down ♪ ♪ Falling down ♪ ♪ Falling down ♪ ♪ My heart has fallen for you ♪ ♪ My heart keeps falling down ♪ ♪ My heart keeps falling down ♪ ♪ My heart keeps falling for you ♪ ♪ My heart keeps falling down ♪ ♪ My heart keeps falling down ♪ ♪ My heart keeps falling for you ♪ ♪ Falling down ♪ (knocking) - Hey. - Hey. Wow, two visits in a year? I'm impressed. - [Cheyann] You act like I never come here. - Ah, no you don't. - I don't know, maybe I'm allergic to the sawdust. - Yeah, okay. - So, is she here? - [Darius] Yup. - Did she move in with you? - [Darius] Nope. - I've missed you. - Really? - [Cheyann] Yes. - You got a funny way of showing it. You know, asking all about your friend. - Yeah well. Seems like more your friend than mine lately. - [Darius] Hmm, well whose fault is that? - Okay, I was wrong. Kind of went about this whole thing. (chattering) (kooky music) - Don't mind us. You can continue talking. - Yeah don't worry about us, we just listening. (laughing) - [Dairus] Anyway. So you were saying? - You know what, just, can we talk later? - (sighing) Well I'm kind of busy later. But I'll call you. - Okay, I guess just call me. - [Darius] All right. - He will. (sniffing) Mm, you smell good. - Boy. - I'm just saying, it's delightful. (light music) - Oh good. I need to talk to you. Daniella's in town. And I think I'm gonna just tell her what happened. - What? You really think that's a good idea? - No, but, god it's eating me up inside. - Okay well, do it in a public place. - You know what, I'ma just tell her. I'ma just tell her that I was drunk, it was a big mistake and it only happened one time. - Yeah I think that'll work. - Right? - No. - Oh. But you know what, that's what I'm gonna tell her. - Really? Sweety, you're a very talented writer. I'm pretty sure you can come up with something a little more creative than that. (R&B music) - [Cheyann] Thanks for agreeing to meet up. - Yeah. I wasn't gonna pass on a free meal. I'm living off of my 401K right now. - I have something I need to tell you. - What is it? - I don't know exactly how to say this. - Say what? - Okay, well. - Come on, just say whatever it is you have to say. - Darius and I had a, thank you, thank you. - Had what? - We had a night together a couple weeks ago. - What does that mean? (gasping) Oh, you slept with Darius, is that what you're trying to say? You better say something. Did you sleep with Darius? - Yes, I did, but, it wasn't supposed to happen. We were at my premiere and we started drinking-- - Please don't use that dumbass I was drunk excuse. This is not college, that does not fly. - I wasn't gonna say that. - (scoffing) you know what, I knew something like this was gonna happen. It's typical Cheyann. - What? I've never done anything like this before. - Yeah, not this exactly. You just can't stand to see me happy, can you? It's like if I'm not wallowing in misery with you then it's a problem. - That's not true. - Oh it's very true. Our lives always seem to run parallel. When I have a man, you have a man. When I'm single, you're single. I don't know if it's planned or it's a coincidence but it always seems to happen the same. - That's what it is, a coincidence. - It's just a coincidence. You know I think you need to figure out whatever it is that makes you happy so that you can learn to be happy for those around you. - This isn't enough. But, okay. It's cool. I think that went well. (light music) (knocking) It's open. - Yo, yo yo. - Hey. - Hey. You aight? - Yeah. - Okay. So what happened last night? I've been calling you like crazy. - I was having dinner with Daniella. - Oh. Wow. So you finally decided to mend things, huh? - Well nothing was mended. - Why not? - I told her what happened with us. - Did what? Yo! What happened to the friend code? Like why would you do that? I thought we agreed that we was gonna leave it alone because you said it didn't mean nothing. - Well I couldn't hold it in. - Wow. - [Cheyann] Wow, what's the problem? - The problem is that Daniella and I decided to move forward. Now this. - Well at least you're going into it with honesty. - Yeah, but I didn't tell her, you did. - Well whatever, now she knows. - Whatever, now she knows? Yo, so you really like this? Acting all selfish? - What?! - Was it hard for you to hold it in or you just really didn't want to hold it in? - Look, I'm not selfish. I was just being honest. I felt like the girl needed to know. - Well thank you. - [Cheyann] You're welcome. - Thanks. Next time, stick to the code. I'm out. (sighing) I think I need to leave them both alone, man. - What you talking about, man, your little love triangle? Look, why don't you give them to me, I know what to do with them. - What are you gonna do? - What I'm gonna do? Monsieur, are you not familiar with a menage a trois, it's my specialty. - Now you see, this is why I don't be telling you anything, man. - Look, you're making this way more serious than it is. You know what the problem is? The problem is that both them girls in love with you and they can't handle it. - Ah, Daniella, she might be like that but Cheyann, nah, she don't love me. I mean we used to mess around talking about stuff like that but, we never took it seriously. - Man look, just sit back and enjoy the ride, all right? Let them do all the work and you just play the game. And you know what's even better about the situation man? They're not even talking to each other. - Hmm. (kooky music) Listen. I just wanna apologize to you for not telling you about Cheyann. Look, I didn't wanna hurt you and it didn't mean anything anyway. - I know the only reason she told me was to keep me from you in the first place. It happened. As long as it doesn't happen again, we're good. - Oh no, no. No repeating over here, baby. Just me and you. - Good. - What's that? (laughing) I think I like that better than the pasta. (laughing) - Save room for dessert. - Dessert? Check please. (sultry music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Cheyann, how are you? - I'm good, and you? - Well I can't complain. Look, I'm just calling to see if you'd like to get together a night for some drinks. Dinner? I'd really love to see that pretty face again. - I'm sorry Kevin, I'm actually headed to see someone right now. - All right then. Well maybe another time? You know I'd really love to sit down and talk. - Okay, that sounds good. We'll link up another time. - All right, I'ma hold you to that. - Okay. - All right well I won't keep you. So have a good night. - Thanks, you too. (light music) - Well look, I just wanna take you out and apologize for what I said when we was together last. - No, no need to apologize. I haven't been handling things right lately. - Hmm? - Are you surprised to hear me admit I was wrong? - I just didn't expect it. But then again you do be surprising me every day. (laughing) - Daniella just makes me overreact about things. Everything. It's been that way as far as I can remember. I just feel like I need to stay one step ahead of her. - Why is that? - I don't know. Maybe you were right. - Right about what? - Maybe it is a competition thing. And I just didn't have the nerve to admit it before. - Oh wow. That's huge. - Gotta grow up at some point. Stop hiding behind the truth. - So what you saying?

I don't know. You're nice. You can fix things, you're a great cook. And I like talking to and spending time with you. Yeah, you're someone I could see myself with for a lifetime. - A lifetime? - Yeah, why not? - How can you say you can spend a lifetime with someone you just met? - We're getting to know each other. - Yeah, I guess. So what happened to you in your last relationship? - It's a long story. - I wanna hear. - What's up with all the questions tonight? - Well, why you getting so defensive? - I'm not, I'm just wondering, like what's up? - I mean, we're getting to know each other, right? - Yeah I guess so. If I tell you, you can't judge me. - Not my place. - He was married. - Okay. So you didn't know that when you met him, right? - I didn't know until I drove past his house and I saw them together. - So when you found out he was married, you ended it, right? - Not exactly. - Not exactly? Wait a minute. So how long did you mess with him when you found out he was married? - A couple of years. Look, I moved to LA because I really needed a fresh start from all that drama. - Okay, so that's pretty much the real reason why you moved. - You said you wouldn't judge me. - I'm not judging you. - I'm not so sure. You know what, I could use a drink. You think you want one? - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. (light guitar music) - So... You sure you wanna do this? - Yes. And not while I'm drunk either. - All right. - Oh my gosh! Look at it! It's coming along so nice! You might have to make me one of these. - And you know I will. - You're so good with your hands. You know that turns me on, right? - You hungry? Ah, you want something to eat, we can go eat. Come on, let's go eat. - Wait, what? We just ate, what are you talking about? - We did? - Yes, we did. - I'm tripping, I'm tripping. I'm okay. Come on. (light music) - So... We've been seeing so much of each other and we've yet to sleep together. - Well, I didn't know that dating you was a prerequisite. - Oh it's not. - But I mean, we'll get to it one day, you know. - One day? What's wrong with right now? (sultry R&B music) (moaning) - Hey man, so how's it working out with them two hotties? - Hotties? - Yeah the two cuties, lovelies, boos, whatever you call 'em. - It's actually working like a charm. I mean neither one of them knows about each other but, you know what man, this just feels wrong. - Why? - Because eventually someone's gonna get hurt. - Well duh, dummy, that's how you play the game. Look, look, man, let me tell you something. You make them think you're getting serious but don't you dare get serious. - That's your game, not mine. - Oh no it ain't my game anymore. Hey look, any tapping going on? - Yeah, both. - Oh! Huh, I'm living through you now. (laughing) - Well look, enough about me. What's up with you, man, you still hooked? - Never thought I'd say it, man. She got me. - Well it happens to the best of us bro. - Not all of us though, huh? - I never said that. I mean it could happen to anybody. I think it's actually happening to me now. - Ugh, hey man don't get caught up. Do yourself a favor, aight? - Man, I know you into it, first of all how you gonna give advice when you don't even follow your own? Hah, this dude. - I'm really glad we're back hanging out again like old times. - Yeah, me too. - I'm just curious. Have you talked to Daniella lately? - Nah. You know she got this new job so she ain't got time for me. - I was just thinking about reaching out to her. You know, seeing how she's doing. - Oh. Well I mean if you feel that's the right thing to do, I mean I guess you should do it. - Why wouldn't it be the right thing? - I mean the last time y'all met, you had some pretty harsh words. - Yeah. Guess we have to let it go at some point though, right? - Yeah, that's true. But look, whatever you wanna do, I got your back. - Aw, thank you. So whatever I wanna do? - Whatever you wanna do. - Whatever I wanna do?

I know what it is and I also know what I have to do. But I'll get to teach and I'll get a lot of writing done at the same time which is key to that deadline. - You're right about that. You know I think this could be a once in a lifetime opportunity for you. - I think so too. - All right. Here's all the information. You just let me know if you need anything, okay? - I will. (light music) - Take care. - [Cheyann] Thanks, Erica. - So I wanted to tell you that my mom loved the piece of furniture that you made her. - Of course she did, come on. - It made her very happy, thank you. - No problem babe, no problem. But you know what? - What? - You make me happy. - I do? - Very very very happy. Bring it in, come on. (laughing) - So what's up? - I just got offered an opportunity to do a literacy and writing program in Africa. I think I'm gonna take it. - How long you gonna be doing that? - I don't know. They said I could stay as long as I want and there's a high need so it could be a month, it could be a year. I don't know yet, we'll see. - Wow. I wasn't expecting that. - Expecting what? - You leaving, specially right now. - I think it's for the best. Things are getting a little too deep for me here. - What's getting deep? - Can we just finish the game? It's your turn. - Sure. Whatever, Cheyann. - Okay so there's this lady at my job named Kevinetta. Like what type of name is that? It's almost as if her parents wanted a son but they found out they were having a daughter and they still wanted to name her after her father. It's crazy, right? Anyway, she's always in my business. Like every morning I come into the office, she's watching everything I do, it's like so annoying. Anyway, I think I'm gonna say something to her. - Yeah, yeah , yeah say something. - Are you okay? You just have seemed a little preoccupied tonight. - Oh nah nah, I'm good, I'm good. - Okay so anyway. - Hey hey, you know what? You know what, you're right, you're right. I haven't been myself. I think I'ma go to the crib, you know, relax, I feel a little sick. - Are you sure, are you okay? - Yeah, I've been hurt. I just didn't want to make you feel sad, nothing like that. - [Daniella] I hope you feel better. - Look, I don't wanna get you sick. Nah, you don't want this, it's nasty. I'll walk myself out. - Okay, be safe. I hope you feel better. - I'll talk to you later. (birds chirping) (phone ringing) Hey, what's up, sexy? Nah, nothing, just chilling. Listen, I wanted to ask you something if maybe you and I could hook up for dinner tomorrow night. All right. I'll see you then. All right, later. So, this is it. - Yup, at least for now. - I don't know what I'ma do without my best friend. - I'm sure you'll keep busy with your other best friend. - What best friend? - Daniella? - Cheyann, can we not go there with this tonight? (hip hop music) - We won't. Have dinner by yourself. - Cheyann. Cheyann! Slow down! - Look, Darius. - Why don't you just tell me the truth? Tell me how you really feel about me, stop playing these games! - Look! Darius, I'm not about to stand around and watch you love somebody else when I'm in love with you. I'm not. I got a flight early in the morning. - So you mean to tell me you're gonna still leave when you just told me you loved me? - I gotta go. - Cheyann. Cheyann! (somber piano music) - So I've got a treat for you. - Mmm. - Mhmm. - Looks nice, and you even put it on the good plates. - I did. So tell me what you think. - Mhmm, tell you right now. It's a little hot. Blow it. - There you go. You like? - Yeah it's good. - I know that Chinese is your favorite so I thought I'd pick up something special tonight. - Oh, you picked it up, huh? - I did. - It's good, it's good. - What's wrong? It just felt like you haven't been yourself lately. (sighing) - You know Cheyann left for Africa today. - She did? - You didn't know? - No, I didn't. - What you guys ain't talking no more or something? - No, we really haven't. I mean, we've always been the type to need a break every once in a while. You know I guess it's always worked with us being in two different cities. - I guess. You women are some strange creatures. - Yeah well, you men can't live without us. Am I right? - Mhmm. - I know. Eat up. (somber music) (Darius sighing) - I need to talk to you real quick. - What's up? - I think we need to take a break. - Take a break? - Mhmm. - Why, what, Cheyann left and now you all in love? - What? - I mean I'm just saying, I saw all the pictures of you and her on your phone. - You went through my phone? - Well you've been acting weird lately, and-- - Yo, my phone was locked, yo. - I didn't go through the messages. I mean she's on your screensaver so it's not like it was that hard to see anything. - You know what, I don't even care. I'm out. - Remember, she was the one who left, not me. - [Darius] Indeed. (R&B music) - That's a unique piece. - Mmm. - Yo, Darius! Look, look, man we didn't expect nobody to be here. What are you doing here, man? - Hey. - Oh hey, what's up, Leslie. What's up Mike? What y'all doing here? - We trying to do something different, Darius. - Something different? - I don't think he gets it. - We're trying to do something different. - Oh! - Oh, yeah. - Different! - Yeah. - Oh well let me get out your way so y'all can do something-- - Appreciate it. Do you come here and cry often? - You look nice. - Thank you. Okay. - Of course. I gotta take his key away. He in here crying. - [Daniella] Thank you, we should do this again soon. - We can do this anytime you want. - [Daniella] I had a great time. - Hey, you're gonna always have a great time with me. This is how I do, hey, what up brother? - Hey! - Darius, man good to see you brother. - Hey Jonathan, I almost didn't recognize you. How them furniture pieces doing? - Oh man, they look good bro, I really appreciate that, man. You know your business, man. I'll give you that. - Yeah, yeah. Daniella. - Darius. - Who'd have thought? Y'all know each other? - Let's just say we're acquaintances. Mutual friends. - Yeah, let's just say that. - Goddamn, y'all saying a whole lot but okay listen I'ma get you home. I gotta get her home and then you know, I gotta get home at that table, so. - Yeah yeah, you should go home. - Shoot you know how I do it baby, straight to the house, straight to the house. - All right. - All right, yeah. Let's get right out here. - Yes, come on. - All right, brother. - Daniella. Didn't know about her. (phone ringing) Hello. - Hello Darius, it's Jonathan. Hey it was good to see you down tonight, man. Hey listen, I just wanna let you know that (clearing throat) that thing about me and Danielle. That was just strictly business, you know what I'm saying. We were just business dinner. Yeah it wasn't even really a dinner. It was just business and we was just eating. I just want you to know that 'cause you know I ain't trying to do nothing to hurt my wife. - Hey man, listen. Your business is your business. I ain't got nothing to do with that. - Aight, aight man, that's what I'm talking about. That's good to know. Well I gotta get out of here man, my wife, you know, she cooking up chicken you know. I like to eat, you know what I mean? - Hey, I mean you good with me, my brother. - Aight, cool man. Yeah good to see you man, yeah. (phone ringing) - Ugh. Oh boy. Hello? - Are you home? - [Darius] Yeah I'm at home. What's up? - Do you mind if I stop by, we need to talk. - I guess, yeah. But you all two are tripping. - Who? - You and your buddy. Look, it don't matter. I'm in the backyard. So I'll see you-- That was fast. - I was close by. - So what's up? I got stuff to do. - I just wanted to come by and explain. - Explain what? That you was with another married man? - Look, we just had dinner. - Dinner? Don't you think the marital rate with black couples today are low enough for you to add to the statistics? - Look, if it wasn't me, it would have been someone else. Darius, you don't wanna have anything to do with me. Jonathan and I work together. It was-- - Yo, yo, yo. You ain't gotta explain to me about you and dude. I don't care. You and I, we were just acquaintances. - Look, we both know this was never about me and you in the first place. It was always about me and Cheyann. The only reason I was interested was because I could see how much she loved you and I wanted to know that I could have you. - Why? - Why what? Cheyann always wins. Look, this was my one opportunity to get back at her and be the winner for once. - Cheyann was right. All you want is her spot. - Her spot? I deserve to be here just as much as she does. Look, we don't need a break. We can make this work. - Do you even hear yourself? - Yes, I hear myself. I love you. And I feel like you love me too. Look, you damn sure don't love her. - Are you smoking crack? You know how stupid that sound? Girl you know damn well you don't love me and I don't love you. I mean how can you do this to your friend? - Yeah what you don't know is she would do the exact same thing to me. - Well look, that ain't got nothing to do with me, with you and Cheyann's drama. And I ain't gonna get in the middle of that. Look, y'all need to work it out if y'all can work it out. But the relationship between me and Cheyann goes deeper than we would ever be. - You are such a coward. - Who's the coward? - You know what, I'm done with this conversation and you. - I've been done. (R&B music) - Cheyann, welcome to the Grayfon and Charla show. It is a pleasure to have you on our show. Why don't you start out by telling us about your new book, A Second Chance ? - Yes, well. I believe that we all should allow ourselves a second chance instead of wallowing in our misery. We all deserve to be happy and no one should hold us back from what belonged to us in the first place. That we should allow ourselves to be forgiven as well as forgive. - Looks like your girl back in town. - Yeah. Looks like. - Well I know you about to hit it now. Aight, well just wanna tell you man, about to run out and grab some food with Leslie for a little bit. Want me to bring you some back? - Nah. I gotta get this work done, man. You know we got that deadline we gotta meet. - Yeah man, I know. I'll be back, aight? - Aight. - For now, there's someone here that I need to see and hopefully they wanna see me as well. It's been way too long. - Are you sure you don't want nothing? - No. - 'Cause that corndog spot, you-- - No, I'm good. - Well you know, you're welcome back any time, all right? But up next we have Chef Chris in the kitchen with his vegan tacos. I cannot wait, yes tacos. (phone ringing) - [Cheyann] Tacos, I like tacos. Can I stay for-- (sighing) - Jonathan, so funny you'd be calling right now. - Oh yeah? Explain that, baby. - Nothing. Life just has a way of speaking to you at the right moment. - Okay, so? I wanna see you again. - I really don't think that's a good idea. - Why not? Look, we don't have to go out anywhere. We could just stay in. - [Daniella] Stay in where? - At your place. Look, I can sneak out of here when everyone goes to sleep. About 11, maybe just a little bit later. But all I know is I got to see you again, baby. - I'm sorry, but, I'm better than all of this. I really am. - Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, wait a minute. What are you talking about, where's all this coming from? - Look, I just deserve my own happiness, you know? My own man who loves me and only me. - [Jonathan] Yeah well good luck with that. - Yeah and good luck with you too. And your wife, she deserves better. Goodbye, Jonathan. (sighing) (bluesy music in background) (whirring) - Oh! (groaning) (grunting) (R&B music) - I'm so glad you agreed to meet with me. I've been trying to contact you for months. - Yeah, I've actually been out of the country doing a literacy and writing program in Africa. - Africa? Wow, must have been a great experience. - It was. I mean the people there are amazing and so loving. And to be able to teach so many kids to read and write, it was great. I was glad I went. And I had the opportunity to clear my mind. - Well I'm glad to hear that. - Yeah, I'm actually thinking of starting a program here. There are so many kids that get pushed to the system that don't know how to read or write. - Yeah that's sad but true. - [Cheyann] Yeah. - Cheyann I've really missed you. And I didn't like the way we left things the last time we saw each other. - I didn't either. - Yeah well. Seeing you made me realize how much I still care about you. And if you'd have me, - Kevin. - I'd love it if we could have a fresh start, and we'll see where we can take this. - Kevin, I really don't think it's a good idea for us to rehash what we had. There are so many painful memories. I just, I can't get past those. - Yeah but I've changed. I know what's important to me now. - I've changed too. And I know what's important to me now. Kevin, I gotta run, it's an emergency. - Okay. Yeah I know, go take care of your business. - I'm sorry. - [Kevin] No, I understand. - Thank you for lunch. - Anytime. - You're feeling better though, right? - Yeah, it's just a little sore but I'm all right, Doc, thank you. - All right. All right, so if you need anything, just buzz me. - All right. - All right. - Cool. Man. Oh, I for... (grunting) Doc! - [Cheyann] Darius. Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah I'm okay. They managed to save my hand. - What?! You almost lost your hand? - Yeah. Just missed a major artery and lost a lot of blood and, how'd you know I was here? - Michael, he called and texted me. - Hmm, makes sense. I didn't think you cared anymore. - I do care. I've been calling your phone. It just was going straight to voicemail. And now I see why, handyman. (sighing) I'm glad you're okay. - Why did you leave, Cheyann? (sighing) - Look, when I saw you and Daniella at the restaurant that night, and then you kissed her, I thought that's what you want. - All this time, you couldn't tell that it was you that I wanted? - It didn't seem that way so I left so I could stay out the way. - Stay out the way? Girl. The moment that you left me, I was devastated. - Well that was the hardest thing for me to do, leaving you. I know I was acting crazy at that time and I ran but, really Darius I don't know what I would do without you in my life. I missed you every minute that I was gone. - Listen. Don't you know that not anyone or anything can ever come between what we have? - Well I want more than what we have. - What? - I want more. Believe me. That first night that we were together, it did mean something. It meant everything. - You sure this what you want? - Yes, I'm sure. I don't wanna just be your friend anymore, Darius, and all that Daniella-- - Oh, ah! - Oh my god! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Just kiss me, knucklehead. Ah, ah! ♪ May you never do me harm ♪ ♪ I'm thankful ♪ ♪ I'm grateful ♪ ♪ I got a good man in my life ♪ ♪ Who's gonna be here ♪ ♪ I got a good man ♪ ♪ I got a good man ♪ ♪ I got a good man in my life ♪ ♪ Who's gonna be near ♪ ♪ I got a good man ♪ ♪ I got a good man ♪ ♪ Oh I cherish the day ♪ ♪ You walked into my life ♪ ♪ Baby the joy that you bring ♪ ♪ Is the crucial thing my life was missing ♪ - I'ma call her. - Yeah, you should definitely do that. - Go for it. - Yeah, I should. (phone ringing) - Hey you. - Hey. What you up to? - Nothing, just doing a little too much reminiscing. Need to get some air. - Yeah sounds good. I need you to do me a favor. - Is your hand still sore? - Yeah, that's why I need you to come over here and help me cook dinner. You know Leslie and my cousin are coming over and I kind of wanna make it a knife and them, you know what I mean? - Okay. Well I'll come by in a couple hours. - Actually, you know what, make it eight o'clock. Oh, and wear something cute. No, no matter of fact, wear something sexy. - Yeah. - Okay I'll be there at eight and I'll look cute. - All right, I'll see you. - Okay. (laughing) - She coming. - Yes, you did it! - There you go, there. Yeah! - [Darius] Yeah I figured I'd do something a little shnazzy. - Yeah? - Mhmm. - [Cheyann] Oh. Gorgeous. - Thank you. Welcome to Chez Darius. Mmm. Well I got some more surprises. Dinner is about to be served. - So you don't need my help cooking. - Nah, not tonight. (clearing throat) - I brought appetizers for the table. Oho, Cheyann, look at you girl, you look good! - Mike! - What? - Thank you, Mike. - I can't, look at her, she poppin dude. You, you got the pony, mmm. Ooh, that taste dry. - Mike. - That's some cheap champagne too. Oh my god, Chey. - Get out, man, you're killing the moment. - All right. I love the layers. - Thank you, Mike. (laughing) Your cousin, I just. - I think my aunt dropped him on his head too many damn times. But you do look amazing. - Thank you, babe. - [Darius] So you having fun so far? - This is incredible. I wasn't expecting all of this. - But there's more. Cheyann. You have been my best friend, my confidante, my world for the last five years. And I just can't see myself spending the rest of my life without you in it. Come here. (sighing) Cheyann Winters. Will you marry me? - Darius, I don't know what to say. - Really? - Yes, yes I'll marry you. - See that's what I was talking about. You don't know what to say, got me scared for a minute. I love you. - I love you too, Darius. (light music) Let's see. (knocking) - Hey. - Hey Daniella. What are you doing here? - Are you going somewhere? - Yeah. I'm moving in with Darius. So I'm renting this place out. - Wow. Congratulations. - Thanks. - By the looks of that ring on your finger I guess things are going extremely well. I mean, you could only spot it a mile away. - Come in. (sighing) So, how are things? - Well you know me, I'll survive. - Yes, I do know you. - Cheyann I just wanted to apologize for everything I did. I don't know what I was thinking trying to come between you and Darius. - Well, people are who they are, they don't change. - But you don't believe that. I mean you even said it in your interview. People have to allow themselves to forgive and be forgiven. People can change. - They can. But they can't change what they've been through. It's embedded in them. And I understand that about you. Look, Daniella, I'm really sorry that you were hurt. But I think you need to let go of that so you can give yourself a fair chance. - I know, it's just so hard. - [Cheyann] I know it is. - I shouldn't have said a lot of the things I said. - Well I shouldn't have said a lot of the things I said either. - Cheyann, you're my best friend. Really, you're all I've got. - You know what? I think I can find a few wine glasses in one of these boxes. Maybe do a little wedding planning? You know since you have a little bit more experience in that than me since you crashed a few in your day. - Whatever, haha. - I'm just kidding. Look, if I can't joke with my maid of honor, who can? - Maid of honor? Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. - I'd love to. I can't think of any greater honor than to stand next to my best friend on one of the most important days of her life. - Thank you. - I'm sorry. - It's okay.
