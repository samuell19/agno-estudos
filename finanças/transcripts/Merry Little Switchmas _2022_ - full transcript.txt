It's not, you took too long. - HAILEY: It's my turn, my turn. - Kelis. - JAXX: No, it's not. - Hey, baby. - Hey, mama. - Come on, Hailey it's my turn. You're not old enough to play this game. Yes, I am. It's rated E for everyone. - No, it's rated EEJ. - What's EEJ? "Everyone Except Jaxx." - It's my turn. - Give it to me. Hey, hey, hey. Where's my hug? [chuckles] Mama, thank you so much for watching them. I can't tell you how much I can't get done with the two of them bickering all the time. Baby, go on, do your Christmas shopping, - I got this. - Okay. The two of you better behave. - It's mine. Give it. - I saw it first. Wait, wait, wait. Hey. Good luck. Now, listen, you two know you can't come up in grandma's house misbehaving. - He started it. - Nah-ah, she did. Listen, if you two don't stop all that fighting, Alternis is gonna come visit you. - Who's Alternis? - Who's Alternis? Sit down there. Then I'm gonna tell y'all who Alternis is. Alternis, the forgotten Christmas spirit. It's kinda like the ghost of Christmas, past, present, and future. But instead of visiting Scrooges of the world, he visits brothers and sisters that can't get along. What happens when he visits? Ooh, he performs a special magic. [both] Oh. Now you two may see this magic if you don't cut it out. Just like the family in this book. Now let's just see how the story goes. "Alternis, the Forgotten Christmas Spirit. Our story takes place one week before Christmas in the halls of Thatcher Prep Academy. The hallway was filled with a bunch of kids. Kinda like that..." [school bell ringing] TESS I A: Good morning, Thatcher Prep. This is your vice principal Miss Vaughn. We have an exciting week leading up to Christmas vacation. First and foremost, study, study, study. Final exams are coming up this week fast. Emily, are you still studying? We have to go over the sleepover details. Okay. Okay. I'm coming. Shh! TESS I A: The boys' varsity team will be taking on their arch rival Garnet Catholic school in the Annual Christmas Classic game this Friday night. [whistle blowing] Way to put the moves on Brandon. That's what I'm talking about. TESS I A: We also have the Christmas science fair competition coming up. Students of all ages are allowed to participate. Warm up those Bunsen burners, you mad scientists. [laughing] Look, baby Aiden still believes in Santa Claus. - [all laughing] - No, I don't. Oh, my God, we totally have to watch The Notebook. It's like this really old classic rom movie. I think it was made in, like 2000. That's not black and white, is it? Ew. No, not that old. What about a Christmas movie? I guess we can sneak in Mean Girls. That's not really what I had in mind. Last but not least, don't forget to hand in your permission slips for this year's yuletide ball. We'll be crowning our Mr. and Mrs. Claus. There's my Mrs. Claus. Dude, dream on. Next to your step-sister, Vanessa's literally the most popular girl in school. She... she's not my stepsister yet. - Those crowns are ours. - Right. But first, you gotta ask her to the dance. Watch this. Hey, Vanessa. I was just wondering... Get lost. [laughs loudly] What's going on? Get in here. Your brother's such a nerd. [exhales sharply] Yeah, okay. Okay. Hey, Vanessa, just doing some stretches before the big game. [chuckles] Sure, I'll make the game winning shot for you. Did you also happen to read the latest chapter to Lord of The Flies for English class? Crazy stuff, right? I mean, what does that even say about our society? [sighs] Dude, what cool girl wants to talk about a homework assignment. [exhales sharply, clears throat] What's up Vanessa? You wanna make a TikTok vid? How about we go to the janitors' make-out closet on the first floor. - [clears throat] - Mom. Make out closet? Thanks for letting me know. - I'll be shutting that down. - What? No, you can't. Don't care, now, get ready for dinner and don't start another Game Boy. Mom, Game Boys haven't been a thing since you were a kid. Whatever it's called. X-Cube, Play Box, Sega. Sega? Put a shirt on and get downstairs. Mom, please, do not shut down the make out closet. You told your mom? God. You and your sister are freaks. [door bangs shut] [playful, magical instrumental playing] I'm sorry, what? We're officially tying the knot. Tying the knot as in? They're getting married, you idiot. - Emily. - I know what they're saying. I'm just making sure. How about you make sure to stop blabbing all of our secrets - to your mom? - Guys. I told you it wasn't my fault. You betrayed us all. You know what you're like? - You're like... - Benedict Arnold. Who's that? He betrayed the Continental Army to join the British in the American revolution. So in other words, you left the students to side with the parents. - Not a good look, bro. - Yeah. What he said. All right. Enough, hmm? What's gotten into you two? I'm sorry, Daddy. I'm happy for you. Brandon, I'm sensing you're upset. Stop trying to read my mind. Brandon. What a shame Benedict Arnold turning his back on his new family so soon. [playful instrumental music playing] I don't know, maybe he needs more time to get used to all of this, us moving in together, us getting engaged. I don't know. I don't know. I feel like... Like, are we rushing this? Hey, hey, hey, no second guesses, okay? They're our kids, they'll see how happy we are. And don't try to psych me, Joseph. I thought you loved my psychic abilities. [chuckles] Oh, you know, by the way, my sister Tracie texts me and she says she's gonna come in this weekend instead of Christmas Eve. - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm. Is that a problem? - No, no, not at all. - Okay, good. Because you know she really just needs family time. I mean, this breakup is really hard for her. Of course. Love her. Wouldn't have it any other way. Okay. [Tessia speaking indistinctly] JOSEPH: Of course. I just can't believe this is happening. Sometimes people aren't meant to be together. Sorry. Oh, no. [soft instrumental playing] Even they can't get along. None of us can. I have to think of a way to get us all to stay together. [tapping] ♪♪♪ Morning, Dad. What's up? Mm-mm. Hey, Dad, just checking to see when you're picking me up on Christmas Eve. Also, my big game's Friday night, maybe you could come? Just let me know. [sighs] I wish you were still here, Mom. Especially, so I don't have to deal with him. Keep it down. [sighs] It's like they came and took over everything. - [knocking on door] - TESS I A: Emily? - Is it okay if I come in? - Sure. - Is everything okay? - Fine. What do you need Principal Vaughn? You know, you don't have to call me that anymore. Yeah, well, "Mom" isn't an option and my father always taught me it's rude to call an adult by their first name, so... All right then... So listen, I was wondering if it'd be okay if my sister stayed in your room? Sure. Not like I have a choice. [knocking] Oh, this is... This is girls talk. Okay. I'm gonna go. Don't forget Curtis is coming over for dinner tonight. I remember, - your college buddy, right? - Yes. Do you think we can introduce him to my sister? Maybe. Maybe. Hold that thought. You, pretty girl, ready in five? Yes, Daddy. [imitating Emily] Yes, Daddy. [sentimental instrumental playing] [playful instrumental playing] Note, color change from crimson red to violet. Now, for the test to see if this formula will truly make me like something I hate. [sighs] Here goes nothing. [gulps] Give it a moment to settle, then... nope, still don't like it. [sighs] Getting everyone together by Christmas is a failed experiment. I'll just think of something else to do for science fair. It'll take a Christmas miracle for me to get this to work. Maybe there's another way. JOSEPH: Aiden, come on bud. We gotta go. [electricity buzzing] [playful instrumental playing] [magic tinkling] ♪♪♪ - My man. - Yeah. - Whoo! - [laughs] - So good to see you, man. - Man. You still remember every move, don't you? Yes, sir. Now, I gotta warn you, Tess is gonna try to hook you up with her sister. Oh, what we talking? She's... she's interesting. How interesting? Like a woman I never met before and I'll be captivated? Just interesting. How she look? I'll let you be the judge of that. - It's good to see you, man. - You, too. I just don't get why I can't spend Christmas with Dad. Because your father... He's a busy man. But it's Christmas. Well, you do have a family here who wants to spend Christmas with you. Who? The doctor, Little Miss Sunshine, and the nerd? Pass. [chuckle] Okay. Well, you can think what you want about them, but your soon-to-be-stepfather, he truly cares about you. And you could at least be cordial with him, hmm? Make that my Christmas gift? Can't I just get you, like, a fruit cake or something? Oh, sweetheart. Nobody likes fruit cake. [playful instrumental playing] I just think you two would get along. I'm not too sure about that. Your fiancé hasn't exactly sold me. - Oh, really? - [Joseph coughing] I just haven't gone in detail just yet. Trust me, Tracie is a real catch. See? Aren't you a little too old to be reading fairy tales? It's not a fairy tale, it's real encounter with a Christmas fairy called Alternis. Alternis? More like Al-bogus. [Brandon laughs] You can't laugh at that, only I can. Whatever you say, Wicked Witch of the West. Don't laugh at him. Hey, you two, enough. You guys know better. Can I be excused? I'm not hungry. No, eat your food first, man. It's okay, honey. You can be excused. No, I don't want you guys to fight I'll eat. Fight? What are you talking about, Aiden? I heard you guys say that you didn't belong together. We weren't talking about us, we were talking about Aunt Tracie. [with mouth full] See? All done. Thanks for dinner. You see what y'all did? [magical instrumental playing] "Alternis, I call upon thee to bring us Christmas joy-ingly. This is no time for pout. We need to see what your Christmas spirit is all about. Perhaps we need to be rearranged for all of us to finally change." [magic tinkling] [door bangs] [banging on door] Hello? [screams] Shh, sorry, sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, kid. I didn't mean to frighten you. For I was called upon, and now I am here. [magic tinkling] You're Alternis. Right you are. I'm the forgotten spirit of Christmas. The B-list celebrity of spirits, so to speak. Well, everyone knows about Christmas past, present and future, but everyone always forgets about poor old Alternis. This is crazy. No, this is more than crazy. This is completely illogical. Hey, hey. You're the one who called me here, kid. Oh, what's this? What are you doing? This is the answer to your prayers. Once I mix these two, you'll all see from each other's perspective and hopefully, it'll open your eyes to the true meaning of Christmas. But it's not me, it's my... I call it my "Merry Little Switchmas." Now, before I do this, I, of course, must read a little disclaimer. [magic tinkling] It's for the lawyers. "Merry Little Switchmas is a voluntary method of getting one's family members into the spirit of Christmas by switching them. In no way, shape or form is Alternis," that's me, "responsible for any bodily harm that comes to any of the participants as that falls upon the wisher," that's you, "and any other emotional drama that this may cause. All participants will remain in the bodies of the ones they switch with until they finally realize how to treat each other with love and respect and most all enjoy the Christmas holiday. All participants have until morning to switch back or they'll remain in each other's body... "Here! What was that about not being able to switch back? Oh, come on, kid. Are you really gonna make me read all that again? Remember, I got it in with the big guy. - Santa Claus is real? - [laughing] Santa, is he real? You believe this kid? Of course, he's real. Now, let's get this show on the road. Wait, how will I know if it worked? Oh, trust me. You'll know. Wait, can you switch it with, like, a dog or a cat? I think that'd be really funny. Sorry, kid, humans only. Here we go. - Wait! - ALTERNIS: What? What? Will it hurt? - Maybe. - What? Good luck, kid. I'm rooting for you. [magic whooshing] [Aiden coughing] Dude, this is why Mom said no science experiments in the house. EMILY: Aiden! [all coughing] Oh, my gosh. It worked. What worked? Wait, why do I sound like... One crazy dream. I don't think this is a dream. - Aiden, what did you do? - I didn't do anything. Yeah. What's going on? He made some crazy science experiment, now we switched bodies with each other. Oh, I feel so strange. That's the sense of your body being clean. I shower twice a week. Aiden, switch us back now. I can't. I don't know how. What do you mean? You did it, so just, like, undo it. It's not that easy. So then what? Are we just stuck like this? For now, I think so. I don't feel so good. Oh, my stomach is in knots. Oh, this is awful. Welcome to being a woman. It passes, only lasts seven excruciating days. - What? - If you won't try then I will. Emily stop. Don't touch any of that. [calm instrumental music playing] ♪♪♪ So Dad... Mr. Kingsley. - Mr. Kingsley? - Sorry. Joseph, what's on your agenda for today? I didn't realize you found psychology so interesting. I don't. Emily, shouldn't you go finish getting ready for school? I am ready. [screaming] You better get back upstairs and fix my... I mean, yourself. You are not going to school like that. Hey, don't talk to your sister like that. Yeah, Aiden, don't talk to me like that. I'm just nervous you're ruining your perfect complexity and getting your hair in knots. I don't care about personal appearances. Society shouldn't tell me what I need to look like. That's right, Emily. When did you start caring about that? I don't, I just know that Emily has a reputation to uphold and I don't want it ruined. Emily, why don't you at least go wash your face, and Aiden, you should take it down a notch. TESS I A: All right, everybody out in five. Hey! [Emily belches] Bye, Dad. I mean, Mr. Kingsley... I mean, Joseph. B... bye. [playful instrumental playing] Emily in the Twilight Zone? Stop, you're gonna poke my eye. Stop. Stay still. Geez. Emily. I can't ruin my reputation, okay? TESS I A: Come on, guys, let's go! [playful instrumental playing] Hey. Hold on a sec, okay? I just wanted to make sure you were okay after our conversation about your dad. Okay. I know this all must be really hard for you, sweetie, but I hope you can enjoy your Christmas with us. Yeah, I could do that. Okay. [chuckles] [playful instrumental playing] [school bell ringing] Okay, Emily, you need to latch onto someone who looks like the biggest nerd in here, beside yourself. Kingsley. What are you doing sitting at my desk? I should have known, it smells like a loser. [students laughing] You better get up now before I make you. Oh, I gotta get up, but it may take me a week to wash this stench off my body. [students laughing] Gregory, Aiden, I've had enough of you two constantly fighting. And I'm tired of the apologies because you both really don't mean it. - But... - A butt is what you two needed to be sitting on. No, as an important lesson, you are to work together for the science fair competition and that's final. And Aiden, I trust you'll catch Gregory up to speed with whatever you have planned. [suspenseful music playing] - Hi Brandon. - Hi Brandon. - Hey, Brandon. - Hi. Oh, yes. - KID: What's up? - Oh, yeah. [chuckles] Gotcha. Okay, Brandon. I think it would be so cool if you asked Brandon to the yuletide ball. You guys would look so cute together. Perfect timing. Brandon, what a coincidence to see you here. You know, we are just chatting about the yuletide ball and how Vanessa still needs a date for it. That's unfortunate. I'm sorry you don't have a date. [chuckles] He's so funny. Such a kidder. Hold on a second, Vanessa. - What are you doing? - I don't know. This is my one chance, our one chance to get Vanessa to go ball with us. - You need to ask her. - But I can't dance. Dude, you'll learn. Don't blow this for me. - I don't know if this is a... - Come on. Anyway, Brandon here actually had something he wanted to say. Don't you, Brandon? I... what did you ask Santa Claus for Christmas this year? I guess I'll find out next time. I... I have to run.
