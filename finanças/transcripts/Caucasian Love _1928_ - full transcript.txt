In order to make the project successful I urgently recommend removing the Chechens to Turkey to make room for Cossack settlements. Requesting your permission, Head of Terskoy Regional Army, - General Loris Melikov, May, 1864. Vladikavkaz Government dispatch to Head of Army: The Great Knyaz accepts your proposal. Best of luck. The farther you go, the better it is for us. - Kartsov The village of Verdi What are you dreaming about, Eliso? Hasn't your Khevsur come? Chechen headmen gathered to discuss giving fields to the Khevsurs, a Georgian tribe. We have no pasture left, our cattle are starving. I must return with the final answer. A guest of headman Astamir, Khevsur Vazhia, messenger of his people. Come now! Your fathers always allowed us pasture land. Why do you hesitate? We'd like to, but the general won't allow us. What general? The pastures are yours! I'll talk to the general myself. I swear by Christ, if Astamir rejects me, I'll kidnap you! I swear by Allah! If my father rejects you, I'll follow you! If my husband were headman, she wouldn't dare associate with this Gyaur! The whole village has been busy building a house for the poor widow. And now - to work, men! People expelled from the neighboring village because weapons were found there. A sad situation! Let's go. Look at that place. You could move in right now. Are you serious? It's not space enough for even half of our people. It would be great if you removed people from that village for me as well! I can't. It's a peaceful village. They don't have any guns. I have an idea. We'll attack their cattle. Then the guns will appear. Your task is to drive the cattle away. The rest is up to us. Don't worry! First do your job, then we'll pay! Driving away... the cattle! Run to the village. Hurry! Rustlers! If I were headman, such things would never happen to us. Youngsters! Run to help Vazhia! What can we do? There isn't a single gun in the village. If my husband were headman, we would have some guns! The cattle! Vazhia! Thank you! Thank you! These guns are presents for you. No, we stay away from guns. We can be expelled from our village if they're found. Stash the guns in the headman's house. Let no one see you. What's the commotion here? Our cattle was rustled. Thanks to this outsider, we got them back. Announce to the sergeant that guns were found at the headman's house. Tomorrow I'll return from the general's and talk to your father. Go to the commander and give them back! Where are the guns? I already sent them to your commander, so you don't have to bother. I did it to prevent evil gossip that this village has guns. Verdi is the most suitable village for our purposes. But it appears they don't have any guns... The village is agitated. Some of our people were injured. Expel them! But make it look like they went willingly. Understand? WILL- ING- LY! The command's to evacuate the village of Verdi. It's none of your business! Rejected! Those pastures have been promised to the Sunzhenski Cossacks! Rejected? What about our cattle? How should I know? Go and ask yourself! This petition has been rejected! The cattle will starve to death. Sign this! The command is to reject! I ask you, please sign it! Kill that bastard! Sign it! Write that no one will be forced from the village of Verdi! Well then... Wasn't it you who let him in? Shut up! In regard to the wishes of the villagers, they are allowed to emigrate to Turkey. Major-General Loris-Melikov We never asked for that! Apparently you did, since they're sending you out. No, we didn't. We don't want to go! Better you do it willingly! One of your men killed an officer! The owner of this sword is not one of us. It's a Gyaur sword. Show a little mercy. We're not guilty! I don't have the authority... General's order. Better to perish here than in a foreign land! We won't go! NO! I'll show you, you bastards! Run and tell Vazhia we're being driven out. What if we petition the Great Knyaz? What do you think? It might help us. But the whole village has to sign! We need to write a petition so they'll let us stay. Another cheat. We don't need it! To the Great Knyaz The village of Verdi asks Your Majesty to have mercy on us, to cancel the order of removal, for we never asked to leave here. - Seidula. Rewrite that in a way that will please the general. They're marking the houses. Rumor is they're moving us. But you asked us to remove you from here! No, we asked to be allowed to stay! We have the proof right here! Seidula betrayed us! Traitor! Cossacks! Pass it to Eliso, and I'll try to get to the village before morning. The villagers depart. They go into a dark night, toward an uncertain future. Give me the baby, I'll help. This paper from Vazhia cancels the expulsion order! It's too late! My only regret is that we left the village intact. What a trick! Managed to kick out the whole village in one night! This paper's from the commander. I need to see your officer. Go on over to Seidula's. The village is on fire! Bastards! I'll find who did this! Give me the list of villagers! The village is on fire! Astamir Asbiev, headman, 62 years old. Eliso, his daugher, 18 years old... Where is your daughter? Here I am! A very gloomy morning rose over the villagers. The Gyaurs have destroyed us! Eliso... I ask you to... to send the baby... to Mozdok... They've expelled us because of him! You killed that Russian officer! I made them write a document that you were not to be expelled. He's not guilty! It was you who signed that order! Astamir, I'll go with you! No. You would always be an outsider among us. Remember your vow, Eliso. You must come with me! No! I can't leave my father and my people. Please... take this baby to Mozdok. After inhabiting the mountains for centuries the village departed, but the villagers continued to nurse hatred in their hearts for their oppressors. THE END
