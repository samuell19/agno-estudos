[♪] -[birds chirping] -[dog barking] [inhales] Let me ask you a question. Yeah? You got 20 minutes till the end of the world, you smokin' weed or you clappin' cheeks? Mmm, do I get to pick whoever I want? No, no, 'cause then everyone would just pick Kylie Jenner. It's gotta be someone you've already had sex with. Then I'm probably fuckin', yeah. Smart choice. -[joint sizzles] Thank you. Hey, did that Lisa Brodeur lady ever get back to you about the designs you sent her? No, I don't even think it made it past her manager, so. Well, and then fuck Lisa Brodeur, and fuck her manager! They don't know shit. I mean, it's possible that my work actually sucks, but... One day, she's gonna see everybody wearing your stuff. She's gonna say to herself, "I missed out on a good bitch". Right. Yeah, we'll go with that. So what time we are going to Schmidt's tonight? I get off at nine. Okay, and what's gonna be your approach? -My approach for... -Okay, don't play dumb. Like you don't know you're gonna see Lily tonight? I don't care if I see Lily tonight. Yeah, and my dick is 22 inches long. Let me ask you this, man. Why do you care if I see Lily tonight? I don't care. All I'm sayin, is you and her breakin' up was the best thing that has ever happened to you. Yeah, and that's why she's dating some other guy. See? It worked out. Yeah, the guy with the receding hairline, why do you think she's not bringin' him tonight? How do you know she's not bringing him tonight? Because she knows that you're gonna be there. Touché. Look, man, I have to get to work. So I'll see you later on tonight. Okay, I'll see ya. [door closes] This isn't right. I look like dog shit. Well, it's a little long, but what were you thinking? Do you see how my ass looks? I said I wanted to look like Halle Berry! Well, I'm... She's not a plastic surgeon. You do have a flat ass. Well, it's your fault! Everyone on your side of the family has a pancake ass! -Well, what about Aunt Ruth? -She's obese! How 'bout I make some alterations, and I'll call you when it's done? I guess I don't have a choice. Oh! Oof. I'm gonna put itching powder in her dress when she comes back. [chuckles] -Try anthrax. -[scoffs] Are you leaving soon? Three minutes. Are you going to Derek's party? Wasn't planning on it. You should go with me. Mmm, I actually have something else planned for tonight. [scoffs] What do you have planned? Going to the city with some friends. How about you go to Derek's party first? [laughs nervously] As much as I would like to get drunk and make out with you, I won't have the time. Well, what if I went with you? Did you just invite yourself? [chuckles] I know we're not technically dating, but I wanted to see you tonight. I mean, that'd be nice, but look, I'm going with some friends. My friends, in particular, are... [exhales loudly] Trust me, you just won't have as much fun as you think you will. You don't want me to meet your friends, do you? No! No, I'm... You just don't get it. Look, trust me, my friends are a different breed of crazy. Hey, Lily! It's nice to see you. I know it's been a while, but you look amazing, and did you maybe wanna catch up some time, or... ♪ Pick up the phone ♪ [cell phone buzzing] -♪ Pick up the phone ♪ -Fuck! ♪ You got hoes calling ♪ -Yeah, yeah, I'm on the way. -One last thing, though, we gotta give Luke a ride. No, we don't have time to pick him up. Relax, dude. I think I see him pulling up right now. Yeah, he's almost here. -All right, I'm gonna get gas-- -[phone beeps off] -[cell phone buzzing] -[mumbles softly] Hey, man, you almost here? Supposed to be here 15 minutes ago. My stomach hurts. Did you tell Stacey about the ring? No, Schmidt told me not to tell anybody, so I didn't tell anybody. I'm a man of my word, okay? All right, man, I'm on my way. -Yo, what's up, man? -Yo, you guys on your way? Yeah, we'll be leaving soon. I'm just getting some gas right now. Who's all there? Yeah, Andrea's here, Aylin, Andrea's friend, Bridgette, and Lily's on her way. Okay, cool. Hey, man, I know you're excited about seeing Lily, but can you try to keep the drama to a minimum? Because I have some news. -Hey, have you seen my heels? -What? I'm just talking to Stacey. Yeah, I didn't ask who you were on the phone with, -I asked if you've see my heels? -Oh, sorry. Yeah, no, I haven't seen them. Why are you acting like that? You know what, babe? I haven't had my One-A-Day yet, and you know I get weird when I haven't had my vitamins. -[Stacey] What? -Whatever! -Hello? -[footsteps departing] Schmidt? Hello? -Yo, I'm gonna propose to Andrea. -When, tonight? Yeah, tonight. Just get here quick, man. -[car engine revs] -[tires squealing] [Joey] Stacey's talking out of his ass because he's nervous about seeing Lily tonight. Yo, yo, yo, I thought she was dating that dude with the fucked up hairline? Mm-mmm, not tonight. Okay! Jackpot! Man, all right, all right, all right, don't encourage. Hey, my dude, can you turn over here? -Why? -It's G-14 classified, buddy. If we're picking up drugs, I don't want nothing to do with that. Tell him. I don't know if we have a choice. Man, Schmidt's proposing tonight, man. Damn! I know. -You know? -Yeah. Did he tell you that we had to pick the ring up from my cousin? Why do we have to pick up from your cousin? Is he a manager at Zales? My cousin, T-Dawg, remember? T-Dawg? We're getting the ring from T-Dawg? This is the same T-Dawg that doesn't believe that the Holocaust happened? [Joey] Well, he also sells stolen shopping carts, too. [Luke] Man, if y'all wanna be so damn scary, I'll just go in there by myself, man. It's gonna be another 40 minutes. 40 minutes? Man, I got the homies downstairs. We got shit to do, man! -I got plans! -It's Scene It night. He's taking a bath. He always takes a bath on Scene It night. He takes it very seriously. I don't give a fuck about none of that truthfully. I'm about to go upstairs my damn self and get him, -'cause y'all playin'. -No, no, no, no! You'll mess up his ritual. I'll see what I can do, G! I don't give a damn about no damn ritual. [sighs] And he got all these damn books! He can't even read. -[chuckles] Okay, T-Dawg! -[pills rattling] One for my troubles, you won't mind. [footsteps descending] He's gonna be mad at you. [footsteps clomping] Cuz, you couldn't wait another 40 minutes till I finish my bath? I got the homies downstairs. We got shit to do! Now I gotta start all over. The quicker you give me this ring, the quicker I can go. You feel me? Well, when you put it like that, you make me feel like a bad cousin. [snaps fingers] Carla, give me that ring. -Huh? -Ring! But you gave this ring to me. Girl, I'll get you another one. You can get it off your finger. Stop pretending. -[ring clanks] -Sorry, Cuz. We doin' Scene It night at a friends house later. Viciously high stakes. You should slide by. I don't think I'll have time, bruh. Are you sure? We doin' Nickelodeon Scene It, Disney Scene It, regular Scene It. We got Scene It everything, pimpin'. I'm gonna let you know if I got time, pimpin'. Okay, we always lookin' for new players. Thank you, man. This is gonna mean a lot to my homeboy, for real, for real, bro. You don't know. Don't mention it. Next time, you coming to Scene It night. All right, man. Get your ass outta here. [fist taps] [pills rattling] Hey, hey, baby! Don't eat those. -Why not? -Those are laxatives. Then why the fuck does it say Molly Percocet? 'Cause whoever been stealing my shit gonna be in a world of shit! [Luke] I gotta take a shit. What, couldn't take a shit at T-Dawg's? I didn't have to go then! -Stacey, drive faster. -[Luke's stomach gurgling] [groans] Man, I need your ass to pull over -or something, man. Oh, my god! -[farts loudly] -What are you gonna do, shit on the road? -[straining] Oh, my god! -[farts] I can't hold this shit no more. -What the fuck you doing? -I can't, oh, my God! -Dude, not in my car! It's too late for that. [Luke groans] -Oh, shit! -What, you couldn't hold it? -[Luke groans] -[Joey whimpers] Oh, my! [Luke exhales] Man, that shit was like LeBron, man. You know, like when he coming down the middle, you can't stop that motherfucker, man. Oh, my God, Luke! Why do you gotta fuck everything up, man? -Oh, shit! -All right, well, look, someone I work with is having a party tonight. You know, he lives nearby here. He might have some clothes for you. [Luke] Stacey, man, I could kiss your ass. [Stacey groans] [Stacey] All right, Luke, we're gonna go inside. Just stay in here. Yeah. Don't even worry about it fellas. I'm gonna hold the fort down. Yeah, I bet you are. While you're at it, clean the fucking backseat of my car, man. Duh, motherfucker! Oh, God! So your friend shit in your car... -[laughs] -and you came here? I know, I know. I'm sorry, man. It's a lot to ask for, but we really didn't have any other options. Look, man, it would just mean a lot if you could help us out. Yeah. So I'll get some cleaning supplies, and maybe like a blanket or towels for your seat? He's gonna need some clothes. Oh! Do you think my clothes will fit him? -I don't know, man. -Yeah, should work. [Derek] All right, well, you guys go enjoy the party. -I'll bring everything out to him. -You sure? Yeah, yeah, go talk to Carolina. -Wait, who is Carolina? -Don't worry about. Ohh, that's what I'm talkin' about! Hit it and get it! Y'all gonna lose some money up in here. [rap music plays] All right. Let's get in and out. The place has more wieners than an Oscar Mayer factory. -Hey, Schmidt's calling. -Okay. [bottles clanking] Hey! Hold up! Hey, man. What's up? Yo, where the fuck are you guys? -We got held up. -When are you gonna get here? Dude, I think she's on to me. I know. Just relax, man. We'll be there soon. All right. See you soon. Hey! Thought you had plans? Yeah, I did. What's in your cup? Have some. -Whoa, take it easy. -Oh, sorry. I just... I needed that. [scoffs] Does that mean you're gonna stay and get drunk with me? I'd like to, but I actually have to-- I have to leave soon. You know, I'm not gonna chase you forever. I know. It's just-- it's not that I don't like you. It's just, I actually like you, you know, a lot, but, it's just, I... I've got some clean pants and blankets. And more importantly, I've got some pants, 'cause I heard that you might've shit in yours. Who the fuck are you? [stammers] I'm the guy with the pants and the blankets, man. The fuck is you smiling for, bruh? Give me the pants! [chuckles] I'm just a happy guy. Here's the pants. Blankets are going through the window as well. But one thing about these is-- so my uncle, his name's Jerry. He's really talented with, like, sewing. [hits keys] Never had one lesson. I've always wanted to learn how to play. Yeah, I started when I was about five. Wrote my first symphony around six. Toured around Europe, played for the king. Sounds a lot like the life of Mozart. Mozart took lessons. Joey's self-taught. [giggles] I think my boyfriend's here. So you like me enough to hook up with me but not date me? [laughs nervously] I mean, would-- What? I mean, would you want to date someone that like, still thinks about their ex? -[scoffs] -Hmm? No, I guess not. But everybody's got baggage from their past relationships and-- Hey, Luke finished wiping his ass. Let's go. I have to go. Well... -Hold on. -What? I'll wait for you, but not forever. -Who is that? -No one! -Is that Carolina? -No. -Wait, you want to stay? -No! [traffic noise] Well, he's all cleaned up. Man, fuck all that, man! These white ass Bob the Builder ass pants, man! Come on, they don't look that bad. -I mean, if you cuff 'em... -Cuff 'em? [Stacey] They'll look fantastic! Man, this shit ain't my style, man! It's your style tonight, Playboy. Man, ain't this about a bitch, man?! -You gonna get in or what? -Fuck y'all, man. -[Stacey] Finally! -I'm gonna get fucked up. Fellas, fellas, fellas fellas, fellas, fellas. I think it goes without saying that, if the conversation comes up, I did not shit back here, all right? All right, well, it most definitely happened, so... If you gonna mention it, at least tell people I got QB sneaked, man, for real. -Yeah, no problem. -Just make sure you have the ring, man. Man, I got it, man! Damn. -Uh-oh. -What? Why did I just find dick pills in my pants, man? Like what's your homeboy on? I mean, those might help you if you're trying to get laid tonight. God knows you need it. -Hah! -[upbeat fanfare music] [exhilarating music] This better be legit. Man, it's legit, my brother. I'm gonna get it appraised. [Luke] Man, it's a steal, man. Literally. Anybody else think this is a terrible idea? When are you thinking about doing it? Maybe after a couple drinks. Good old-fashioned liquid courage. -[all] Cheers! -[glasses clanking] [upbeat hip-hop music] Hey, Stacey! Hey, Andrea. Where have you been? Oh, me and the girls, we're still getting ready. But we wanted to talk to you for a second. Talk to me about what? -Just follow me. -Okay. I think I know what that's about. [mumbles] I don't know. Okay, Bridgette, this is Stacey. Stacey, this is Bridgette. -Hi, Bridgette. -Hi. Very nice to meet you. Likewise. -Hi, Aylin. -Fuck you, Stacey! Yeah, thanks. Uh, I thought Lily was supposed to be here? -Yeah, she's gonna meet us later. -That's cool. -Ooh, I hope she's bringing that guy she's seeing. -Shut up, Aylin! You know what? I'm just going gonna, you know, go back to the guys. Oh, no, hold on. I have to ask you something. Schmidt, he's been acting weird lately, and I was wondering if he's going to... Is Schmidt going to what? Is Schmidt going to propose? Uh, I mean, I'm sure he is eventually. Yeah, but is he gonna do it tonight? -I don't know. -Stacey, you've got to tell me! Look, I know your loyalty lies with Schmidt, but come on, how long have we known each other? Okay, so if he proposes to you tonight, would you say yes? Of course I would say yes! -Does that mean that he is? -Fuck, man. I mean, if he finds out that I told you, -then he's gonna kill me. -Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Stacey! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Okay, you can go now. Oh, can you move? I need to repaint my nails. Should I change my outfit, too? -Yes. -Yeah. All I'm saying, is it's way more common than you think, okay? No, I'm pretty sure that was embarrassing. [chatter] [R&B music] -Uh-oh. -[Luke stammers] -Hi. -Hello. I'm Luke. I'm Bridgette. Damn! I like them shoes. Thank you. I got a question for you, though. What is it? Would you fuck your dad to save his life? -I mean, you've got to, right? -[Bridgette chuckles] Like, it's your old man. Oh, man. You sound like the next Victor Hugo, the way you weave those words. I'm gonna go take a shit in a real toilet. [Bridgette] He asked me if I would fuck my dad. [girls chattering] All right, ladies. Touch of bullshit. What are you doing? Let's just say I found some use for those dick pills. Enjoy your jerk, my boy. -[bell tings] -[man] Green 87! -[bodies thudding] -[whistle trills] Just make sure our boy drinks it. I didn't see a thing. Thanks, Stacey. Hey, so what do you think of my friend, Bridgette? Uh, I mean, I don't really know her too well, -but, I mean, she seems cool. -You should go talk to her. Eh, not really my type. So you're holding out for Lily? So what, are you gonna give me shit, too? Sorry, Stacey, but it's pretty obvious. You know, I hope she doesn't show up at this point. Well, I think she wants to see you as much as you want to see her. Hey, I thought you said you had some limes? Oh, yeah, follow me. [indistinct chatter] She doesn't know I'm about to propose, does she? -She knows. -How? Look, you two have been dating since the eighth grade and now you live together. I think she'll say yes, man. -I'm not drunk enough yet. -[chuckles] Whoo, I'm feeling fucked up. Oh, yeah? Well, here. Drink this. Ah, thanks, buddy. You're a gem. Let me spin it for you this way. If you had to eat my ass or suck on my toes, now, which one are you thinkin'? Okay, but if I have to eat your ass or suck on your toes, then it would no longer become a sexual act of pleasure. Oh, my God! Okay, Luke, eat ass or suck toes? Shit, I'd do both, man. What you're saying is like me saying just because you'd fuck a girl in the ass means that you'd fuck a dude in the ass. Oh, my God! Okay, but if I'm fucking a guy in the ass, then I don't have the option of fucking pussy, right? Everything I say, you try to twist it around -so I look like an idiot! -You don't need help from me. Are you sure you want to marry him? Do you think Lily was actually really serious about that guy? I mean, she doesn't talk about him much, so I doubt it. I mean, I think you should give it up 'cause the love of your life might be looking at you right in the face and you'd never even know. Okay. Yo, everyone, Ubers are here. Ahh! Hey, let's finish our drinks, man, before we leave. It'll be here when I get back. [Bridgette] Do you wanna show me that later, like, after the first bar? [chattering indistinctly] All right, but should we go to Old Crow or should we go to Sluggers? No, dude, let's go to Sluggers. Old Crow sucks balls. [Stacey] So are you gonna propose at this bar? I don't know, man. I'm gonna wait till I'm less nervous. You being nervous is your body telling you "do not do it." Man, fuck all that! I know you better propose after all that shit we went through to get that damn ring, dude. [foreign accent] Excuses me, would you like me to put on the porn? I find that when I am nervous, it helps me relax. No, we don't want to watch porn! Well, if you do not mind, I think I shall watch some porn. What the fuck? Yo! -Sure. -[woman moaning] [Bridgette] Where are we going? -Sluggers. -Oh. If he proposes to you in a smelly ass bar in front of a bunch of drunk people, you better say no. He could propose to me in a porta-potty and I would say yes. Did Schmidt's friend say anything about me? Stacey? No, he's in love with my cousin. Oof, if Lily fucks him tonight, she's dead to me. She is not going to do that. She's seeing that guy. The balding one? [Andrea] Well, yeah, but he wears a hat. There is a lot of potential out here. I told you, man, not tonight. Oh, come on! Don't leave me with Luke! It's like he sprays on pussy repellent every morning. Besides, best way to get back at Lily, make her jealous. Right! Yeah, 'cause that always works. All right, I'm gonna hit the dance floor, and get my move on, bring back some chicks. [hip-hop music] [bar patrons chattering] So theoretically, we could all be an atom on someone's penis. [chuckles] Oh, hold on. I gotta take this. Business. Hey, man, it's not really a good time right now. I'm having drinks with a couple supermodels. I'll sign the check. Just send the papers. Send 'em to my penthouse. [chuckles] No, you know what? Mansion. [chuckles] Nah, penthouse. And honestly, don't call me unless it's actually important, okay? Okay. Penthouse? Yeah, or the mansion, and you guys can pick. Well, which one has the pool? Well, before we get too ahead of ourselves, I wanted to tell you something about my friend and I. And to be honest, it's really hard to be truthful about this. You can tell us anything. Well, we suffer from PE. What? Premature ejaculation. Yeah. But don't be discouraged, okay? I mean, we can still really connect. Oh, so sorry, a friend's calling. -I got to... -Bye. What the fuck was that? I'm trying out new material, okay? -No, right, right, right. -Get off my back. -Let me get Luke over here. Luke. -No, don't. Please, don't, okay? Just look at him. -I mean, he's pathetic. -Right. -Just stay here. -Uh-huh. -I'm gonna go get two more. -Go get 'em, champ. [bar patrons chattering] [hip-hop music] [dreamy music] [hip-hop music] [bar patrons chattering] [water running] -Towel? -Thank you. Cologne? Yeah, I guess it couldn't hurt. [spritzing] -Thanks. -[cologne bottle clatters] Yeah. -Thank you. -Thank you. [hip-hop music] Yo! Why did you leave me hanging like that? That was my only shot! Dude, I went to the bathroom. I'm guessing you know Lily's here? Yeah, I know. -What are you gonna say? -I don't know. All right. Well, if you go over there, make sure you have a beer in your hand, or you're gonna accidentally grab her boobs. Better yet, just grab her boobs on accident. I'm not trying to play games with her. I'm just trying to say hi. Okay, I'm just trying to help you out. I'm going over there. It's weird if I don't. Just don't fuck it up too bad. [mocking] "Just don't fuck it up too bad." [bar patrons chattering] [hip-hop music continues] Hi! Schmidt, buy me another drink. Now. Hi, Lily. Hi, Stacey. Um... really happy to see you. Yeah? Why's that? Well, I don't know. I mean, you know, it's been a while. Well, there's a reason why it's been a while. Do you want me to just, like, walk away? No, Stacey, I'm kidding. I'm happy to see you, too. Well, that's good. Thank you. Regular or menthol? Oh, man, I swore I'd quit, but if you insist. That'll be two dollars. Uh, I don't have any cash on me. How's my credit in this place? If you don't have any money, I want my cigarette back. -I already put it in my mouth. -I don't care! Give me! Listen, man, I don't mean to be rude, but you never said I had to pay for it. It's customary! All this fuss over a cigarette? -Do you want me to have to kick your ass? -Shit! Then after med school, I plan on moving to Arizona with my sister. Yeah? That sounds-- that sounds really cool. So what have you been up to? Well, I'm working part-time, and I actually sent in some of my work to this pretty well-known artist. I'm waiting to hear back from that. And could be pretty hooch. We need to go. Security's coming after me. -Hi, Joey! -Hey! What happened? Well, the guy in the bathroom, he's being a world-class asshole! What? We can't take you anywhere. -What did you do? -He pulled a knife on me. -Get his ass! Go! -Stacey! -Stacey! Fuck! -Let's go. [Joey] Hey! I see your friends are still idiots. Ooh! I almost forgot about how kind and non-judgmental you are. You think I'm gonna let you flirt with me like that? Aww, flirt with you? I wouldn't dare. Good, 'cause it wouldn't work. I've got some new tricks that you don't really know about. I heard old dogs can't learn new tricks? Maybe you shouldn't believe everything your friends tell you. If you're trying to metaphorically tell me that you've changed, I'll need to see it to believe it. Hey, Lily, the Ubers are here. Are you going back to their apartment? I don't know, it's possible. I'll see you there. [Bridgette] Wait, wait, the Ubers are here? I wanna go to another bar! No, we're going back to my place first. Oh, and it looks like you were getting along really well with Stacey. You're not seriously considering going back to him, are you? I just haven't seen him in a long time, that's all. I thought you were seeing that bald guy? He's not completely bald. Well, it's okay. He probably looks super good with a hat. So, how'd it go with Lily? I saw you mackin'. -No, we were just talkin'. -Mmm. That's why you got that stupid ass smile on your face. [woman moaning] What is up with our Uber drivers watching porn? [Joey] What the hell? [Schmidt] What the fuck is that? You guys want me to turn it up? -Uhh... -You can turn it down. Oohh! I want another drink. [girls chatting] Where's Luke? I don't know. Well, he's definitely not with a girl. We can rule that out. These motherfuckers really ditched me, man? [dog barks] [pants heavily] Abandoned dog? You are cute though, huh? You got a name, little fella? Let me see, let me see. Snowball. What are we about to get into, huh? Let's see if we can find your owner, little guy. Come on, come on! What am I gonna do with you, boy? Aww, you're so cute! I'm not even gonna lie, you are cute. Hey, where'd you get that dog? I found him, jackass! Well, give him all back. Man, how am I even supposed to know this is your dog? On his tag, Snowball's. All right, man, I believe you. -Here. -Thank you. Damn, what the fuck? Ahh, shit! Are you all right, bruh? You know, it's been a long day, but, you know, thanks for asking. Honestly, man, seriously. I'm talking about your head, motherfucker. [winces sharply] Damn, spicy. Fell out of a window a little tit ago. [chuckles] Tit. Wanna go to the hospital or something, man? Nah, I'll be good man. I'll be good. If it gets worse, I'll just rub some piss on it. America. The saying is, "Rub some dirt on it," fool! I'm pretty sure I said it right the first time. Come on, man! Trippin'. You know what, man? Here. -Get the dog, man. Here, here! -Thank you. So what's your name, partner? Luke, man. Wanna do me a flavor, Luke? No, nope, nope, nope, nope! Gotta go with my friends. -Nope, nope. -What friends? I don't think you got friends. We don't see no friends. We don't think you got friends. I do got friends, dude. So why are you out here by yourself, weirdo? Man, them motherfuckers ditched me, man! Yeah, right. Man, what's the favor, bro? What's the favor, man? I need you to drive me somewhere. I don't even got a car, so can't do it. -Nope, nope, nope, I can't. -Drive my car, numbnuts. Man, why the hell you just call me numbnuts, bro? I'm expecting some people at my casa soon. If you drive me there, give you $1,000. You'll give me $1,000 if I take your ass somewhere? [stammers] You got a hearing problem? $1,000. Look, man, you want the money or not? [uptempo music] [Andrea] Then 20 minutes later, she was getting pushed out on a wheelchair by security. [Stacey] I should probably go talk to her, man. Hey, slow your roll there, buddy. Take a couple sips of encouragement. -Really? -Come on! Just a couple. Just a couple. Hey, Andrea, your toilet's clogged. What? That's the spirit. Ooh! -Gee, thanks, man. -Good luck. Dead man walking. A nice ass, though. [Joey] You see Stacey over there? He's about to make a fool of himself. -How much you wanna bet... -[Stacey sighs] [indistinct background chatter] Take a shot with me? Yeah, sure. -Thank you. -[chuckles] No problem. [indistinct chatter continues] [glasses clank] [mellow guitar music] I like what you did with your hair. Really, or are you just saying that? I mean, you looked good blonde, too. But if you had horns, you would still be the most beautiful person I've ever known. You can't say stuff like that to me. Why, you have someone else here to say those things to you? Maybe I do. Well, where is he? Oh, wait, no, is he looking for his hairline? That's mean. But I see you're keeping tabs on me. Mmm, I mean, my friends may have told me that you were dating some guy with a receding hairline, and, yes, I was curious if it was true. Don't act like you don't know who he is. You went to high school with him. Plus, love doesn't have a hairline. Love? Wow, that was fast! [giggles softly] I mean, no, we've just gone out, like, three times. Good for him! Yep, good for you. Good for the both of you. So have you been seeing anyone? No, no, no, actually, I am-- I'm still holding out for someone special. -[mellow hip-hop music] -[Lily laughs] If you think I'm going to believe that you are some born-again virgin, than you must have more brain damage than I expected. [indistinct chatter] I told myself I wasn't gonna talk to you tonight. No, that's all right, I told myself the same, but it didn't exactly go as planned, though, did it? [softly chuckles] [Schmidt clears throat] Excuse me, everyone. I have an announcement. Andrea, will you marry me? Yes! One million times, yes! [Andrea squeals excitedly] [Bridgette] Yay! -Oh, my God! -[Andrea squeals] -I'm so happy for you! -Oh, my God. Get a room. -Yay! -[Lily] Stacey. will you get my phone? I wanna take a picture. -[Stacey] Yeah, where is it? -It's in my purse. -Where's your purse? -[Lily] In Andrea's room. Okay. Oh, it's so good. [chatter continues] -[Andrea] I love you! -Whoo! [mellow rock music] Dude, where the hell are you? You missed Schmidt's proposal. Man, I got caught in some bullshit, man. I'll be there soon enough. Well, right now, we're at Schmidt's, but we're gonna go to another bar soon. Hey, man, don't even worry about it, dawg, 'cause when your boy get back, I got you, man! So rock on me. I got you! All right, well, I mean, do whatever, and then hurry up, man. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, is Joey walking around hard yet? Is Joey what? I put those dick pills in his drink, remember? Oh, shit! [spring boinging] [audio rewinding] -[man ] Green 87! -[bodies thudding] [audio fast-forwarding] Oh, shit! Well, that's not good. -[footsteps approaching] -Hey, what do you got there? Oh, nothing. It's just a purse. -Whose purse is that? -Lily's. -She's gonna take a-- -Are you stealing? -What? No! -Oh... [stammers] Were you just jacking off in here? What? No! -Why does this always happen to me?! -What? What's taking so long? -What's going on in here? -Nothing. Take a look for yourself. He was jacking off in here. -What? No, I was not! -Okay, uh-huh. -You're a pig. -What? Lily? Yo, what did you say to Lily? She looks pissed. -Whoa, dude, put that thing away. -I can't. Wow, I mean, you know, you'd think she'd be impressed. [chuckles] Schmidt! All right, man, tell me what happened. What's the problem? I accidentally took dick pills. -Accidentally? -Yeah, accidentally, man! Okay, look, Luke put dick pills in Joey's drink, and then I accidentally took it. QB sneak, classic. Yeah, it is classic. But then Bridgette walked in, and then Lily walked in, and now they both think I was jerking off. All right, all right, man. I'll tell Andrea what happened, and she'll smooth the whole thing over. In the meantime, take a cold shower, and I don't know, look at pictures of Kristen Stewart to get soft, 'cause we're heading to another bar soon, all right? [Bridgette] What, you expect us to believe he accidentally took a dick pill? Yeah, it's this thing that they do. They spike each other's drinks as a prank. Sorry about ruining your night, man. This is about you and Andrea getting engaged, not my fucking bullshit. Oh, my God. You guys make me sick. Wait, does Schmidt need dick pills? -Bridgette! -No. -What? No, no, no, no. -Stacey is like a delicious bowl of ice cream, and this other guy she's with is like a little cup of frozen yogurt. Stacey tastes way better, but that little cup of frozen yogurt, it's a lot healthier. That made zero fucking sense. There is no test that Stacey could pass that would make a difference. We are never getting back together. He's trying really hard, Lily. I'm just gonna ignore her for the rest of the night. Yeah, good idea. Wait for everything to cool off. I like where your head's at, Lily. Men are trash. She's jealous. That's gotta mean something, right? Okay, but if she really wanted to just be with Stacey, why would she be running around with some guy who smells like Rogaine. Joey's just mad, because no girl has ever liked him more than a couple hours. All right, guys, what porn you guys want me to put on? I got donkey, I got Asian midget, I got big diabetes amputee, I got gang bang grannies, lactating mommies, I got Siamese twins. Double, double penetration! [laughs maniacally] -I'm overstimulated. -Yeah, just let us out, man. [loud music inside] [indistinct chatter] Dude, are you gonna actually drink, or are you just gonna sit there sad all night? I am drinking. Oh, shit, she's coming. Lily, hey. Dude, you just gotta forget her, please. Just get a little more swifty with me, and I'll call some chicks over, all right? -Oh, my God! -Carter? What are you guys doing tonight? Schmidt and Andrea got engaged. How did he trick her into that? -I don't know. -So what's up with you, man? -You gonna drink with us or what? -Yeah, absolutely! Order another round. What is that, pink? I'll take that. I'm gonna go say congratulations. All right. Excuse me. Can we get three more of these, please? [Carter laughs] [Carter continues laughing] So what have you been up to, man? Working or... Yeah, so I took some time off after school, you know? I went to Mexico and really found myself. I got Giardia. And I don't know, dude. The only thing I got out of college was a drug habit. [laughs] Beyond that, I don't know what I'm doing. All right, we got to do something. -You guys are depressing. -Oh, wait a minute. So you're not with Lily anymore? No, no, no, no, we haven't been together for a long time now. My sister's back in town from school and she always had a thing for you. The fact that you would let this piece of shit date your sister, I mean, has never made sense to me. No, see, you don't have a sister, so you don't understand. No matter what I do, she's gonna be getting railed by somebody. It might as well be one of my friends. -[Joey] That's gross. -Speaking of gross, Aylin is looking really good tonight. Where is everyone? I don't even see Schmidt and Andrea. I don't know. Looks like they ditched us. Well, we can go to my place. I live like a five minutes walk from here. -Yes, let's do that! -Yeah? -Carter, is that you? -Hey, yeah. [laughs] Aylin, you know, I didn't even know you were here. [giggles] Where is everyone? They left, 'cause you're so painfully unbearable to be around. Hmm, not as painful as those text messages you sent me last night! Yeah, he's just upset, because I said that Stacey could bang my sister and he couldn't. We're going to my place. You wanna come? -Yeah, that'd be fun. -All right! I have to go to the bathroom first. -So texts? -She made it up. -Yeah? -She made it up. Guys, it's me. It's your buddy. Who is she anyways to you? -Your best friend or some-- -[horn honking] [Carter] Lisa Brodeur lives in this area. You can just go to her house and knock on the door. Who's Lisa Brodeur. She's the hottest clothing designer right now. She made that Kanye shirt with the gophers on it. And Stacey's idol. Ooh, okay. So wait, what did she say when you sent stuff in? It never made it past her manager. -Fuck her! -Yeah, right? Fuck her. Do you make money from your art? -No. No, I don't. -[Aylin scoffs] Then why do you do it? Why are you so annoying? Lily won't get back with you if you're broke. I don't care. -[laughs] Yeah, right. -[laughs] Right. [Joey] Come on, dude! Okay, you guys got me figured out, all right? I love Lily! You know, but just because I lost her doesn't mean I actually wanna get back together with her. -Nobody believes you. -Geez, calm down. We were having a conversation. And, dude, it's a little dramatic. Hey, Carter, do you think your mom made brownies? Yeah! You guys see that? [Joey] See what? What the fuck? -Yeah. -Let's go this way. Yeah. -Let's turn back. -Yeah, it's cool. [train clacking] [Luke] Bro, what the hell is going on? Since you've been so generous... I'm a repay you -with a performance... -No, no, no, no, no. -No, no, that's okay, bro. -...of some unreleased music. Yeah. [exhales loudly] So sit back, relax, and please, no-zee pictures. [sniffs loudly, clears throat] -You all ready? -[sticks tapping] ♪ Shadow icons no more ♪ -♪ 3-1-2, put me on ♪ -Stop! -Turn that shit off, man! -♪ Shadow icons no more ♪ ♪ I'm a star boy now ♪ ♪ Shadow icons no more ♪ -[screams] Stop! Stop! -♪ Way too gone ♪ ♪ Way too faded ♪ Yo, dude, what the fuck was that? -I've never been so scared in my entire life. -Holy shit! -[all panting] -I think-- I think we need to tell somebody. You're right, you're right, but first, let's see if your mom made brownies. Yeah, okay, I can use a brownie. A brownie? Hey, Carter, can I use your bathroom? Yeah, last door on the left. -[door creaks] -Stacey? Is that you? Hi, Nicole. What are you doing here? I ran into Carter at the bar. Who else is here? Just your brother and Joey. -Oh, okay. -Yeah, yeah. -Come in. -Oh, I don't know. I kinda came to hang out with Carter. Only for a little bit. Okay, fine. [Joey] Do you have any milk? Yeah, but my mom only has almond. [Joey chuckles] How do you milk an almond? -Lasers. -[chuckles] Lasers? [Nicole] I used to have the biggest crush on you. I never said anything, because you and Lily, and I'm sure you didn't notice me. No, no, I-- I noticed you. I was a disaster back then. [giggles] Well, I mean, it was a while ago, so. What are you guys up to tonight? Would you wanna get a drink with me? Um... I had a crush on you in high school. Yeah, you're right, I probably shouldn't have said anything. -It's okay. -I'm just gonna go eat some brownies with the guys. Stacey, I'm majoring in clinical psychology. So tell me what's wrong. [chuckles nervously] Yeah, you don't really need a major in clinical psychology to tell me what's wrong. Then talk to me. Okay. Well, in the matter of a few hours, I have managed to completely ruin my chances with Lily, and I've also come to realize, that nearly everything I've been working on in my entire life has probably been all for nothing. [Nicole] I wouldn't say it's been for nothing. I work part-time at a tuxedo shop. Well... If you can milk an almond right now, I'll milk you for a week. I'll take you up on that. I'm lonely and I've got a lot of almonds. -Oh, shit, my phone. -[phone buzzing] Hey, man, did Aylin come in with us? No, we outran her. Shit, I think we gotta go get her. Why? She left me, like, 35 voice messages. I think she's still getting chased by those people. -Here. -[finger taps] [Aylin screams] What am I supposed to do about that? Let's go. We're gonna need some weapons. Maybe you've just been trying to do things your way, and it's just time for a change. Nic, we need to borrow your pepper spray. -I don't have pepper spray. -Aunt Vicky gave you some after she got groped at the Barnes & Noble. -Oh, yeah. -Yeah. [Stacey] I'm sorry, what's going on here? Oh, we forgot about Aylin. -I didn't forget about Aylin. -Oh, shit, Aylin! Thank you. -All right, here we go! -It was good seeing you again. -Bye, Stacey. -Hey, Nicole, it's getting kinda late. You look a little tired. Maybe you need a cup of Joey? -[Stacey mumbles] -What? [Aylin screaming] [Stacey] Try calling her again. No, dude, it's just going to voicemail. I can't get her. Well, hopefully we're too late. -[Aylin screams] -Whoa, whoa, whoa! -Did you hear that? -Let's go! Come on! -Are you okay? -Where the fuck did you guys go? -We've been looking for you. -Bullshit! -You better back up! -Yeah, yeah, yeah! Hey, hey, hold up, or we will fuck you up! Fucking spray him! -How do you-- -Give me that! -[pepper spray whooshing] -[groaning] -Yeah! -Please, please stop! [groaning] -He's all right. -What'd you guys do to Brent? -She fucking maced me! -What are you guys doing? We're street performers, man. We're fucking street performers! Street performers? You guys are gonna get killed. Well, what did you guys think of the show? It sucked. It fucking sucked! I thought I was gonna get gang raped! You just don't understand. They just don't get it. They just don't get it, guys. They just don't get it. Let's go. -Un-fucking-believable. -Yeah, try some milk. [Brent] They don't get it. Come on, guys. Let's get outta here.

Drive me to my apartment, and I'll make sure to get you some cold, hard dinero. I promise. -Ain't this your place? -[dog snarls] Ugh. Oh, my God! Ain't this your place? You think I'd live in a piece of shit like this? -[clicks tongue] -[dog snarls] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Snowball! Geez. Why'd you bring me here then? Rehearsal! Practice makes perfect, my baby. -[dog snarls] -[mumbles] -Man, is the money at your house? -Hey, hey, hey! Yes, sir, and I live right around the corner. Oh, my! Man, I'm not going nowhere else. For real! I'm not going nowhere else! I wouldn't want it any other way, my guy. [uptempo music] [Carter] All right, so what's up? You guys trying to go to another bar? No, I think I'm done with bars. -I think we're just gonna head to Schmidt's. -All right. -I'll go to a bar with you. -Okay. Man, we should probably get food for everybody else. Get some cheese fries. Ah, that sounds good! I mean, even though we just ate, but fuck it! [Stacey clears throat] -Stacey, don't be a-- -That's Lisa Brodeur. [Joey] That is Lisa Brodeur. Stacey, you gotta talk to her. I mean, look, hey, if you were getting food at three o'clock in the morning, you wouldn't want anybody to annoy you. -I'm not gonna go. -Oh, you are a bitch. She's the bridge to your dreams, man. You can't let her walk out without talking to her. I just-- look, I don't really want to. It's three o'clock in the morning, you know? Maybe next time. I'm gonna see Carter again. Next time, right? I'm gonna see you again. What's gonna be your excuse next time? That's like Rihanna wanting to give you a BJ, and you saying no, 'cause you're playing hard to get. [Carter] Yeah, dude, what's the worst she could say? -I'll go break the ice. -No, no, no, no, it's-- I'll go. -Go. -No, I got it. -It's fine. -Good luck. [Lisa] Yeah, I leave about an hour ago. I think Woodrow's watching him while I go out of town. -Yeah. -Hey, what's up, man? How you doing? [Lisa] All right, I'll call you in the morning. Okay, bye. -Hi. -Hi! You're Lisa Brodeur, right? Yeah. Wow, you must be a real fan if you can recognize me? Oh, you wouldn't believe! I love everything that you do. Oh, and you have great taste. Well... [laughs] What's your name? Oh, I'm sorry, I'm Stacey. -Hi, Stacey. -It's nice to meet you. -It was so nice to meet you. -Yeah, likewise. Nice to meet you, too. Wait. I'm sorry, excuse me. I'm actually also an artist, and I wanna do what you do one day. -Oh. -So... -If you have the time, I-- -Yeah, let me put you in touch with my manager. He actually vets everyone for me. -Let me just-- -I actually... I'm sorry. I have sent some of my work to -your manager already. -Oh! Okay, well, if it was really that good, he would've sent your work to me, but keep trying, and-- sorry, I have to take this, but good luck. You're right. Thank you. [LIsa] Hello? What?! What you mean you lost him? -So how'd it go? -What she'd say? That I sucked. What the hell does that mean? [Joey] She really said that? I'm gonna go out there and push that bitch in front of a bus. [Aylin] You're really maturing. It doesn't matter. Okay, I just-- I just wanna get outta here. Do you think I'm past the point of no return? In what way? You know, in regards to my career. You know, like, is it too late for me to go back to school and get a real job? Some would say you can go to school whenever, but as your best friend, school's for losers. But I mean, more people need to start liking my work, other than my friends, of course. Stop stressing about that, man. It'll happen eventually. Right now, let's just focus on getting to Schmidt's, smoking a big, fat bazooka blunt and watching Rush Hour. -You think Lily is still there? -Oh, my God! What is it with the self-sabotage theme? First, Schmidt, now you? Schmidt proposing to Andrea isn't self-sabotage. Are you gonna propose to Lily? And if I did? I'd have to kill you. Right there on the spot. Look, man, I'm not gonna propose, -but I am in love with her. -Why? I mean, dude, she doesn't love you. I mean, she's fucking guys in hair loss infomercials. Look, I didn't choose to be in love with Lily, okay? No matter what I do, wherever I fucking go, I'm always drawn to her, and... I think it's time I stop fighting it. Okay, you know, we just need to find you a new chick. Why does people being in love make you so angry? Because why would someone with their whole life ahead of them take an oath to have sex with one person for the rest of their life? I mean, look at divorce rates. I'm not that crazy. Have you ever thought that maybe for Schmidt and Andrea, they don't wanna live the rest of their lives if it's not with each other? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And even if you are right, and they do get divorced, you can't tell me that Schmidt's not in love with Andrea right now. Okay, I can't personally relate, but I get your point. And if you wanna fuck up your whole life with Lily, I'll still be your best friend. I'm just glad that I'm smart enough to know a scam when I see one. One day, I'm gonna be the best man at your wedding. When that happens, you can set my balls on fire. Dude, where the fuck are we? You wanna call an Uber? -[laughs] No. -Yeah, you're right, no. All right, I'll look up some directions. Here, let me ask this rat for some directions. Hey, little buddy, can you point us in the direction of some big booty bitches? [wheelchair creaking] You can't trust rats! They're all liars! Holy fuck! But I can take ya there. -[laughs] -We're fine. -[continues laughing] -We're fine. -Goodnight! -[laughter echoing] [door creaks open] When I get nervous, my toes shake. But take a seat, man. Make yourself at home. -Get comfortable, you know? -As fun as that sounds, I'm gonna do the opposite, bro. I'm here to get my cash, bro, for real. Yeah, man, this is my better half right here. What happened to your head? Fell climbing out of a window earlier. -Just business. -And who the fuck is this? I don't remember his name. I just... I found him with no friends. It's Luke, motherfucker, and I do have friends. Sure. Anyway, what did you do with the car? Did you get rid of it? -Where is it? -We left it outside. You drove a stolen car here? You know how much heat that's gonna get us in? Nah, baby. Had him driving. Bruh, I know damn well you did not just have me driving a fucking stolen car? -The fuck is wrong with you? -I knew you'd understand. Bro, you a filthy motherfucker, bro! I oughta knock your ass out! Don't talk to my husband like that, Buster Brown! Nah, baby, it's cool. It's cool. He's had a rough night. Let's get this guy his money. GO get dinero and... -Six, nine, six, nine. -[safe beeping] [safe chiming] You're breaking into my merch money, too. I ain't too happy about it. Stressing me out and making my toe shake. Give me my money, bro. Got me feeling weird in my own shoes. Thank you for doing me a favor, you know? All right, man. [clears throat] I guess I'll call this the first payment, but I gotta do laundry. Bro? Two dollars, bro? Gah! I gotta do laundry, bro. I gotta do laundry. Two fucking dollars, bro? You just had me listening to that whack ass band, and all you give me is two fucking dollars? Hey, you a ungrateful piece of shit! That's what you are! -[laughs] Whoo! -[coughs] Fuck both of you motherfuckers, truthfully! No, fuck you and that little ass dog. Bitch, ain't this supposed to be your dog? Nah, I stole that dog. -Man! -That's where you went today? Yeah, I was thinking, instead of stealing all these flat screen TVs, take these cute pets for ransom, you know? That's not a bad idea. Yeah, they should be calling any minute. What did the ransom note say? [paper crinkling] "Hey, fuckers, I took your dog." "I took your dog." Yeah, I screwed the pooch on this one. I appreciate the effort, mm-hmm, but next time, stick to stealing jewelry and DVD players! So what do we do with the dog? We gotta destroy the evidence. Hey, hell no, bro. Y'all did a lot of wild shit, but that's where I cross the fucking line. Give me the dog. It's my dog, Snowball. -Back your ass back, bro. -[video game sound effect] Man, I've been waiting for this shit. Honey, grab my samurai sword! [all yelling indistinctly] [Luke] Bitch! -[groans] Had me driving a fucking stolen motherfucking car, bro? -I'll beat your ass. -Hey, hey, hey, hey! Give me the dog and I won't chop your ass up like a California roll. Man, if you don't back your Kill Bill ass back, I swear I'll call the cops. What do you want me to do? I don't know. He's got you in a tough spot, babe. -You want me to kill him? -Not really. 'Cause I'll kill his ass! Yo, yo, yo, yo! What the fuck going on in here? This son of a bitch is trying to ruin Scene It night! So you decided to come to Scene It night, huh? You know him? That's my cousin, dumb ass! T-Dawg, these motherfuckers are trying to kill a dog, bro. Why the fuck y'all trying to kill a dog? That's fucked up. He's so cute! Look at his little face. Cuz, so you staying for Scene It night? Hell, no! I gotta drop my homie off, man. I'm out! Hold up, hold up, bro. Next time, you staying for sure. Now, get your ass outta here, boy. [indistinct chatter] I'm winning Scene It night. Y'all about to go down faster than Michael Jackson on a nine-year-old! [man] Nah. We gonna take you home little boy, yes we are. [Joey chuckles] [Stacey] Luke? -Yo, What's good, homies? -Oh, my God! -Where the hell you been? -What? Who's dog? Man, I don't even know, man. What are you even doing with this dog, man? Long story, bruh. We just gotta take him home, man. -Well, fuck it, let's go. -All right, let's go. Hey, bud, can I get something to eat, though? Oh, my god. I mean, it's for everybody else. -Man, fuck them people, man! -All right. All right, all right, you can have this. We'll go and we'll grab something else. -[upbeat music] -So what do you wanna do? I don't know. What were you thinking? I mean, we could go to another bar. I don't know. I'm just-- I'm kinda good with hanging here. [Bridgette retching] Let's go to another bar. -Yeah, let's just stay here. -Yeah. Look, it's your new neighbor, Snowball. I don't think anyone's gonna be up, man. Nah, forget that. If they not, they gonna be up tonight. [knocking on door] Let's just drop the dog and leave. -Ah, forget all that. -[pounding on door] I think they heard you the first time. [knocking on door] Oh, my God, Snowball! Oh, thank you so much. Where did you find him? You don't even wanna know, truthfully. Thank you. Hello, Miss Brodeur. Stacey again. Did you guys steal my dog? What? No, no, I promise! This is just like a freak occurrence. Well, how do y'all two even know each other? This is Lisa Brodeur. -Lisa-Lisa? -Yep. Lisa-Lisa? Lisa! You Lisa? -This is Lisa? -Yeah. Oh, Lisa! Oh, my! My boy's in love with you, girl! Girl, can you please look at my boy's stuff? Come on. Oh, he's better than Michelangelo, Picasso, Donatello, Rafael, da Vinci, all of those. I'm telling you, Lisa! Can you please look out for my boy? Like, I'm telling you, he's better-- he's the best artist you've seen. Can you please look at him? Please? -Oh, you Lisa! -So like I told Stacey, my manager vets everyone for me, and he might be a shitty dog sitter, but he has a great eye for talent. And if your work is as good as you think it is, he'll send it to me, okay? So... When was the last time your manager sent you any work? Well, I've been really busy lately. So you're telling me he may have sent you his work, and you just haven't seen it yet? I mean, I guess that's possible. Lisa, my girl, my homie, can you please, please, please, please, do this one favor for us, and go look for my boy's stuff, please? Guys, it's late, okay? Please, Ms. Brodeur. I mean, if your manager hasn't sent you any of my work, we'll leave right away. You got your dog back, but can you at least check, please? Okay, fine. Just wait here. -[door shuts] -Fuck, yes! [indistinct chattering] [screen whooshing] Man, where the fuck is your girl at, man? It's almost four o'clock in the morning. Dude, I don't know. It's not my house. -[door opens] -You guys are in luck. My manager sent me your work. But I am only doing this because you found my dog. You're right, that's fine. Fair enough. All right, just follow my lead. I know how to handle these types. Okay. Snowball must have had a crazy night. He went right to sleep. I hope you guys like whiskey. Oh, we love it. One might even call us connoisseurs. Oh, okay, great, then you're gonna love this stuff. Should we cheers? To persistence. [glasses clanking] [Joey moans] [coughs and retches] A little too strong for you? Sorry, I'm just used to top shelf stuff. I see. I'm sorry, we didn't really get a proper introduction. Oh, I'm sorry. This is Joey. I'm Stacey's manager. And this is Luke, our assistant. And they're also my best friends. Well, you're lucky to have such loyal friends. So Lisa, my friend asked me a funny question the other day, -and I wanted to get your take on it. -Okay. So you got one inch of your penis in your mom right in front of you, and then you got one inch of your dad's penis coming up from behind. Which way are you moving? -I don't have a dick, so... -Dude, what the fuck? I'm sorry, he's a little drunk. Why don't I just get the work that you sent and we'll look through it? That sounds great. Are you gonna fuck this up? I got her right where I want her. -What? -Hey, stupid. Don't shit else until we leave. -[liquid trickling] -Okay. Let's open it up. [pages rustling] Wow, I think this is the one. Yeah, that's actually my favorite, too. I really like it. Thank you. Oh, did you want another one? Oh, always. [cork squeaks] -[liquid sloshing] -Thanks. [bottle clanks] Okay. -So... -[Joey coughs] -You good? -Never been better. Hey, Stacey, can I show you something? -Yeah, yeah, sure. -Follow me. Hey, where's your bathroom? -It's right over there. -Okay. -You're not gonna puke, are you? -No, I'm not gonna puke. 'Cause my cleaning lady was just here this morning, and if you puke, I'll be pissed. I'm not gonna puke. Um, can I ask where we're going? We're going to my private studio where I get most of my work done. Awesome! [Joey retching] Luke, I need your help. Nope, I ain't helping shit. Nope, nope, nope! Please, I can't do this alone. [Luke grunts angrily] What the fuck did you do, bro? You better not fuck this lady house up. Oh, shit! Bro, what? [Stacey] This is amazing. [Lisa] If this place was burning down, this is the only thing I'd risk my life to save. You know, I've studied almost everything you have ever done, but I've never seen this. Oh, I'd never sell this. Why not? You know, you remind me of this painting. What do you mean by that? This was the first painting that I showed to executives, and artists and everybody told me no. If it wasn't for this painting getting rejected, I wouldn't be where I am today. I bet the people who said no are probably pretty pissed. I hope so. But if everyone says no, then what? You're an artist. Stay true to your ideas and success will come. [Luke] Bro, look what the fuck you just did to this rug, man! You fucked it up, man! What we gonna do? Just get rid of it, okay? Just... -What the fuck? -[window squeaks] Bro, I know you're not about to throw it. [Luke speaks indistinctly] [Joey] Fuck! -Where are your friends? -[Joey] Fuck! Well, is it clean? -What? -You got a little bit right- -What? -[Lisa] Where are your friends? Guys? -[toilet flushing] -That shit is stinky. [Lisa] Why were you in the bathroom together? It's a red spot on my wiener I needed help with. You puked in there, didn't you? We cleaned it up, though. Sorry. As long as you didn't ruin my grandmother's rug. The rug in the bathroom? Yes, the rug in the bathroom! Is your grandma still alive to make you a new one? No! Any more whiskey? Oh, my God. Hey, are you okay? What? Yeah. Is it about Stacey? No, it's nothing. I'm fine. You should invite that guy. Just drop it, guys. -My boyfriend's gonna be here soon. -Okay. [Joey] I guess it's true what they say, huh? -Huh? -What's that? All celebrities are assholes. She's like a D-list celebrity at best. She was pretty nice, considering what you did. She'll probably never talk to me again, but at least I know my work doesn't completely suck. [Luke] Finally, Schmidt's place, man. [Joey] Dude, is that guy peeing on your car? -Hey, hey! -What the fuck? Fuck! [Luke] Get your dumb ass outta here, man. -[man] Take it easy, dude. -Stupid! Oh, I don't blame him. It is a PT Cruiser -that's already been shit in. -Fuck you! [Luke laughs] What the fuck you laughing at? It's your shit! That was an accident man. [Andrea] You guys brought food! Did you guys see my boyfriend out there? -What? -Who? -My boyfriend! -I don't even know your name. [Bridgette groans] [Andrea] Hey, is Aylin with you guys? No, she's actually with Carter at a bar. [Bridgette whimpers] [feet clomping] What are you looking for out there? [Bridgette] My boyfriend said he was gonna be here five minutes ago. -[Andrea] It's okay. -Hey! [both laughing] Hey, man, you'll get them next time. Wait, no, no, no, no! Please tell me your secret, man. -[Luke laughs] -You wanna know my secret? I got you. I'll tell my secret. [laughs] Yeah. Hey, has Luke told you how he actually took a shit in the backseat of my car on the way here? -[laughs] What? -Nah, that was QB sneak, man. Okay, okay, guys! I'm starting to freak out! Has anybody seen my boyfriend? No one gives a fuck! Here, let's go outside. We'll go look for him, okay? Schmidt, let's go. Schmidt, let's go. -Fine, fine, fine, fine. -Schmidt, let's go. -Man, shut up. -[Luke chuckles] I had no idea, yeah. Don't even think about it. Too late. [clears throat, sniffs] -Hey! -What? Oh, what, we can't be friendly? [sighs softly] Maybe that's the problem. Maybe you're too friendly? Isn't that why we broke up, one girl wasn't enough? Oh, my God! Lily, look, I don't know what you want from me anymore. If it's easier for you just to hate me, then just fucking hate me. -All right then. It's settled. -I don't care anymore. It's okay. Oh, my God. -Who is this guy? -It's Bridgette's boyfriend. Okay, well, what is he doing here? He got mugged! Wait, hold it, that's them! It was them! They're the ones who attacked me! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second. Excuse me, sir, but you were pissing on my car. You guys attacked my boyfriend? Okay, this dickhead was on pissing on Stacey's car, so we threw a couple hotdogs at him. Dude, you literally threw it at my face! Okay, we should've done a lot worse. What kind of people are you?! They are savages. Excuse me, it's not completely fair to call us savages. This guy was pissing on my fucking car! Okay, that is not a reason to attack somebody! Are you gonna kick them out or I'm gonna press charges? Whoa, look! It seems like it was just an accident, all right? Let's just forget about it, okay? Besides, didn't you say Luke shit in your car earlier? Hey, man, this ain't got shit to do with me right now, man. [Bridgette] Okay, you guys owe us an apology! Here's an apology for you. Your boyfriend pissed on my car. You drive a PT Cruiser, Get a car wash and move on. Excuse me, why are you talking? You have nothing to do with this. [Bridgette] You guys, he's really hurt! Oh, my god! We barely did anything. He's just being a pussy. Why do you act like you're still in high school? Why are you still talking to me? Why are you such an asshole? Okay, we're leaving and I'm gonna call my lawyers! Come on, babe. Thank God that bitch is going. She's so annoying. Hey, where do you keep your weed? -I got you, man. Come on. -[Luke] Finally. [Schmidt] What do you guys wanna smoke out of? I can go get my bong. [Joey] I don't wanna wait 30 minutes for you to clean your dirty ass bong. Let's just smoke a blunt. Andrea... so I'm sorry I ruined your night. You didn't ruin my night, but you might ruin it for yourself. Look, I probably shouldn't tell you this, but she still has feelings for you. Yeah, but it's the type of feelings that's the issue. Go talk to her. Why? I mean, I don't even know why I should bother anymore? 'Cause you two have built up whatever it is towards each other. And look, you're Schmidt's best friend, she's my cousin, this is not gonna be the last time you guys are in the same room together. I mean, I just-- I don't think that she even wants to talk to me right now. [sighs softly] She's in there waiting for you. And realistically, Stacey, how much worse can it get? Yeah. That's easy for you to say. You mind if I take a seat? Well, I'm just gonna sit down. You know, it's not exactly easy for me to see you and know what the right thing to say is, right? What? Guarantee it's not as hard for you as it is for me. If I could go back in time and make things different, hell, better, I would. I spent so much time thinking about the bad times that I'm starting to forget about the good ones. Maybe there weren't too many good ones then? No, I didn't mean it like-- -you know how much-- -It's all good. It's okay. It's okay. You don't have to explain. I want you to do it. Do what? I wanna see if you can still do it. Hmm. You know, I've never been wrong before, right? It's been a while. All right. [clears throat] [hands slapping] Which one hurt the most? This one. Okay. -How about now? -This one. Okay. Do you remember the shapes to pick from? Circle, triangle, or square? And do you have the shape in your head right now? Yes. Circle. Was I right? Maybe. [exhales loudly] You smell that? It's the smell of sweet victory! [laughs] Shut up! What if we did get back together? Oh, the entire universe would explode. Like I'm talking everything gone, nothing left, reverse Big Bang and all. Reverse Big Bang? Yeah. [scoffs] No wonder you failed science. But seriously, you used to say that, if you ever got married, the only way it would happen is if it were to me. I was drunk and definitely horny. That's probably what you told your friends, but I know you meant it. You know, they probably think we're in here having sex. I mean, that's not completely out of bounds, is it? [scoffs] I have been teaching self-defense for two semesters. I dare you to try something. I've been taking TaeKwonDo at Bally Total Fitness. Really? How's that going for you? Yellow belt. Moving up very, very quickly. [Lily laughs] Yeah, they're just gonna have me skip all the other belts, -and just go straight to instructor. -Are they? Yep, I'm gonna be teaching that roundhouse Patrick Swayze style. -[no audible dialogue] -[mellow music] [music continues] [snoring loudly] Wake up! Come on, get off! Morning, guys. Are you trying to get out of here now or what? What time is it? Six. I guess it's as good as time as any, huh? By the way, you two looked adorable. [Luke] Shut up! Here, let me drive. So you were in the same bed as her, but you didn't have sex? -Correct. -Your dick probably thinks you're dead. -Probably. -That does not sound like the Stacey I know. Bro, you waited so long for your shot, and you blew it. I mean, you missed a wide open layup. -Well, I don't play basketball, so... -Dumb! -[cell phone buzzing] -Oh, shit, hang on. Hello? [Lisa] Hi, is this Stacey? -Yeah, who is this? -This is Lisa Brodeur. Oh, Lisa! Oh, hi, Miss Brodeur. How are you? The more I look at your work, the more I love it. Thank you. That-- honestly, that means a lot. In fact, I love it so much that I'm gonna ask you to come work for me. Are you fucking serious? I don't usually offer positions to people who show up at my house at four in the morning drunk, demanding that I see their work, but for you, it worked. Well, yeah. No, thank you. That means-- thank you so much. You have no idea what this means. Oh, and tell your friends, they owe me a new fucking rug, and I never want to see them again. [cell phone beeps] What was that about? That was Lisa Brodeur, and she just offered me a job. -What? -No fucking way, bro! -[chuckles] Yeah. -Oh, my God, dude! I knew it! And you weren't gonna talk to her unless I said something. [rock music] -What? -[Luke] Let's go celebrate. -I need you guys to get out. -Is Applebee's still open? Why the fuck would you pick Applebee's? What were you gonna pick, Long John Silvers? -You can't pick no more. -I need you guys to get out. -Talking about Long John Silvers. -Just get out! I got to go! -Let's go to Applebee's. -Fuck Applebee's! -No. -Just get out. [car door slams] Man, you think you know a guy, huh? You still want to go to Applebee's? [Lily] Absolutely. -God! -[Stacey] Lily? -You need me to stay? -No, I'm okay. Thanks for the ride. -Fuck you, Stacey! -Oh. So you weren't there when I woke up. Oh, well, you know, I couldn't sleep. So what are you doing here now at my house? Okay. Um, I came here because if I didn't, then I would regret it for the rest of my life. Lily, you're the last thing I think about at night, and the first thing I think about when I wake up. And I am insanely in love with you. And I would've married you last night if I could have. Look, I'm-- all right, I'm not saying that we should, like, go off and go get married, but can I take you to breakfast? Stacey, I would be lying if I said I didn't think about a future with us together, but now is not the time. You really like this guy, don't you? Maybe, or I at least need to see where it goes. But more importantly, if I'm gonna settle down, it needs to be with someone who can commit. And I know you might say otherwise, but I don't think you're ready for that. You should focus on your career. You have worked so hard for it, and one day it will pay off. I promise, I don't care about any of that. I only care about you. And I would give up all of that. I'm sorry, but I don't think I'm ready to commit. It's okay, honestly. No need to apologize. No harm, no foul, right? Guess I'll see you around. Hold on. Stacey? This might sound selfish, but if you truly love me as much as I think you do, then don't ever stop. Not sure I could if I tried. Another thing. Is that breakfast offer still on the table? I'm starving. [laughs] Of course it is. Should've known. [Lily laughs] But only as friends. Don't try any of that cute stuff on me. -Watch your step. It's a little steep. -Oh, thank you. -Yeah, no problem. -[Lily giggles] It's got quite the horsepower. [Lily] When did you start driving this? [Stacey] I don't want to talk about it.
