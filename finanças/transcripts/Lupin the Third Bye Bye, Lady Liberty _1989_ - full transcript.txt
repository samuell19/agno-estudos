It's 87 francs, monsieur. Give me a receipt. Don't forget the change! Save it. PARIS POLICE HEADQUARTERS Howdy! Inspector Zenigata of the ICPO. I need to see your file on P-26. Please wait for a moment. I'll let you through. Inspector, sorry for taking so long! Here's the data concerning P-26, Lupin III... on 16 tapes and 1348 disks. What about the data on his people? Jigen Daisuke, Ishikawa Goemon, and Mine Fujiko? I'll go get them if you wish. This will do for now. I'll borrow these for a few days. You can't take them out of here! You can trust me. I'm a police officer among the police officers. No need to see me off, I'll find my own way out. But, but sir... That's a reasonably good impersonation of me. Oh, hi there, Pops... You know what this is, don't you, Lupin. You're under arrest! Gotta hand it to you... But aren't you getting a bit to old for this? If you keep doing this, you could strain yourself... Get a desk job. Wait up, Lupin! LUPIN! LUPIN! Don't catch a cold, Pops. You're no duck. Why you... Well, gotta go. Nice seeing you again, Pops. You won't be able to shake me off that easy! Zenigata doesn't give up that easy! What the... Stop resisting, Lupin! A small gift for you... Lupin III Bye-bye, Liberty Crisis! NEW YORK Get lost. I'm looking for somebody. Where's 536 Camel Street? Much obliged. Want some? Okay. So it's true that you've retired? Huh, what did ya say? What's the use? Huh? They know our every move. It's all in the police database. So that's why you're stealing the data from the police. I was, but it's useless. The data is in the police computers all over the world. It'll take 50 years to steal it all. That's no reason to hang around doing nothing. I've retired from the business. How 'bout one last job? I got us a perfect one. You can retire after that. Besides, I've found love. You got a woman? Judy... I'm wasting my time. Why can't you believe in love? It has destroyed too many men. So long. Judy-chan! I'm home, darling! Have you been a good boy? I missed you. I found a gorgeous bracelet at Tiffany's... so I bought it. I hope that's okay. Sure, anything for my baby! I'll make dinner. Leave me out of it. Lupin is useless. I need your help. Jewels don't interest me. And I don't approve of your association with Rooster. I'm off on a training trip. How much enlightenment do you need? I'll know when I've had enough. I'm glad that I met you, Jimmy. Well, I'm grateful that you belong to me, and no one else. Phone call, sir. Excuse me. Oh, don't take too long. I'll be back in a flash. Don't worry. I've tracked him down to New York. No mistakes, Number 3. Get the diamond before Number 2 does. I understand, Number 1. The whole world shall be in our hands. In our hands. - Hi. - Oh, hi. 536 Camel Street. What do I owe you? $38.50. Give me a receipt. Come out, Lupin. I know you're in here! Come out, Lupin. Lupin and his chick are gone. Are you Lupin's kid? I'm lookin' for him, too. Looking for daddy? No. Aren't you Zenigata? Uh, yeah. You botched up his arrest 738 times... and as a result, your pay is 28% lower. - Uh, yeah. - Tough luck. Hey, wait a minute. That's confidential info! Hey! I guess it's just me and you, Rooster. They've got the place secured. It's impossible to even get close. I remember what you used to tell me... "I'm doing it because it's damn near impossible." And you'd do all those crazy jobs. That's history now. You're still alive and kickin'. Wish I was young again. Move, and you're dead! Go ahead and plug me one. Lupin. I thought you only lived for love now. Love's okay, but a man needs a job. So Judy left you then? Ah! Do you have to put it that way? So she did leave you. Did a broad ever do a darn thing for you? She was two-timing me! By the way, who are those guys out there? I bought her everything she ever wanted. She ran my credit card right over the limit. Not only am I flat broke, I'm 300 million bucks in debt. $300 million? Got no choice but to get back in business. At least, you realized what a fool you've been. All set. Affirmative! Who are they? If we survive, I'll tell you 'bout it. Okay, do your best. Are they after the old man? I'll take care of them, so get the hell outta here, Jigen! Hey, wait a sec! Adios, amigos! Over here, ol' man! Through here. That's smart. This is a helluva way to get back to work. I'll show these bastards. Here I go. Go back. Where are they? Lime Street and Riverside? We'll be there. Riverside... You're Lupin, aren't you? A thief. Huh? You have committed 3331 thefts... of which 88.752% were successful... unmarried, no permanent address... membership in 32 credit associations... holding a total of 327 credit cards... Excuse me, but I'm the phantom, Lupin... III... not your ordinary thief. I got a job for a competent thief like you. I'm too busy to play with good little boys. Jigen! Rooster! Don't move! Rooster, where is it? Huh? Where inside the Statue of Liberty did you hide the Super Egg? We'll get you medical attention if you talk. No! You talk and you're dead! I'll start with you! Go ahead! - Alrighty then. - Stop! Too late! Ain't no sweeter dame than you... Hey, Rooster. Rooster! So Rooster pinched the world's biggest diamond... the Super Egg, and hid it in the Statue Of Liberty? But now that he's dead, we'll never know exactly where. Who sent those assassins, that tried to kill us earlier? The Three Masons. - That secret group? - Yeah. What will you do now? Rooster did save my life. I'll make them pay. Revenge, huh? What about you? The diamond sounds intriguing... Prediction for Lupin's next move. Destination: Liberty Island. Means of access: From the sea, by motorboat. Time: Misty, early morning. Can we get there without being seen? Place must be crawlin' with 'em. I've got a few tricks up my sleeves. What the heck is that? Oh, my god! We're trapped. Blow me down. I came well prepared. - Do you want a duck? - What? These little duckies. Huh? Go play! Cute, huh? Huh? Quit playin' around! Time to go. Everyone on deck! Don't let them escape! We gotta buy some time. The only way is to relocate Big Momma... here so we can work without interference. Thank you. Take that. Good bye, New Yoooork! The question is, where do we take this dish? Can't take her to no motel. The North or the South Pole. Somewhere out of the way. Wh... Who's there? Calculation complete in 3 minutes. I'm calculating the optimal location. You must be richer than Arab kings. This is so wonderful, Jimmy. This airplane is fantastic. You're too much. I'm glad you enjoy this little sky cruise. You're the only man for me, Jimmy. Huh? Don't take your eyes off me. What woman could possibly interest you more than me? It's Lupin. Yo, Fujiko-chan! Hooked another billionaire? Damn, go after him! Get the statue back! But, but, but, sir... Why you, Lupin... ALASKA Please help me. I'm in trouble. Out of the way! Thank you. You're welcome. I'm forbidden to speak to women during my training. But I cannot help noticing your beauty. I won't interfere... with your training. However, allow me to express my gratitude. Won't you tell me your name? Ishikawa... Goemon. I'm Isabelle. You're a wonderful man. I still lack discipline. We are going to jump. Stay here. He's over there! There! Once again I must cut a worthless object. Goemon-sama. Aren't you coming to bed? Well... I... Eh... GRAND CANYON Lupin! Hello there. There's no time to waste. Even the FBI and CIA are after us. The police are still looking for the Statue of Liberty. The President issued a special nationwide search order. Hey, it's Pops! The same glum expression. With a height of 46m and vital statistics of 31m-28m-33m... she's a bit too voluptuous for me. I'm whispering sweet little words into her ear. But she isn't about to give up her secrets. Why couldn't old man Rooster leave a hint or two? Tough luck, I guess. He hid the diamond, disguised as a... worker during her "facelift" in 1986. It could be embedded in the concrete. Lousy sausage. Can't your computer tell us where it is? No way, not without data on Rooster. If you hid the diamond, I could figure out where. I wish. By the way, what about my request? Can't you see that we're busy? What the hell is this? A computer image of my present state of mind. Are you 3 years old or what? So what do you want me to do? Steal a program that controls computer viruses. What on earth is a computer virus? It infects a computer and destroys data. But the one I want not only destroys data, but also manipulates other computers. Explain it so we laymen people can understand. This floppy contains a virus. If I insert this and call up previously inputted data... It spreads and destroys the data. What do you mean by controlling the virus? This virus only destroys data. But there's one that someone invented... that can actually alter data. It's a virus that controls other viruses. Can you alter the data in the police databases too? Bingo. Who's the inventor of that special virus? Where's the data for it? Unknown. The only one capable of finding out is Lupin III. Sorry, Jigen. The diamond hunt is off. I got a virus to find. Help me, Jigen! Really, you shouldn't leave unfinished business. Just kidding, Jigen-chan. Haven't you found the statue yet? We're sorry, sir. What about the whereabouts of the Neovirus data then? Not yet, sir. Where's number 3? Summon him immediately. Yes, sir! The CIA and FBI are soliciting public assistance. The police suspects the perpetrators... to be a major criminal organization. How much is it? You gotta be kidding. What do computers know? My hunch says Lupin is the one guilty. They're coming! Gotcha! Number 3! Number 3! This is Hummingbird. Number 3! Number 3! Go ahead. For you, sir! Jimmy here. What's up? Your "runaway daughter" has been found. Roger. Good news? You seem happy. You're the good news. You always have such a way with words. You own this building? Yes, you can say that. Wait in my office 'til my meeting is over. That'll cost you something from Tiffany's. You're too much. Welcome back, sir. Catch you later. Okay, hurry back. He's got no taste in furniture. Dreadfully old-fashioned. I know this is the headquarters of the Three Masons... the jewelry smuggling group. Well, Fujiko will relieve you of it all. Such frighteningly bad taste. The worst kind! The whole world shall be in our hands! In the hands of the Three Masons... Our success depends on you, Number 3. Yes, sir. Give a 123 year old man a peace of mind. Please be patient, Silverman-sama. Sir... Please. Code lock... No problem. I cant? It can't be helped. I did it. I had so much hope for you. I'm doing my best, sir. We must have the Neovirus... along with the world's largest diamond, the Super Egg! Super Egg? The black magic handed down from our... ancestors of the Three Masons... is no match for the newest technology. We need the Neovirus to stay on top. I want that virus, Number 3! Recover it from that traitor Number 2! I want the data from the Super Egg infont of me now. If you fai I, you'll die. But if you... succeed, Number 3, you shall be my heir. I've mobilized our troops to obtain the Super Egg. But Number 2... Wait! Number 3! You should've stayed at Tiffany's, you fool. But you won't buy me the whole store, right? Time to die. What are you saying? Stop it, Number 3. She can be useful to us. Hey, I thought we weren't goin' very far. It's nothin' but desert out here. Where are we goin'? We'll be there soon. I've got business at the end of this desert. My hunch tells me that Lupin and the statue are in the Grand Canyon. You're joking. It'll take another day even at 100mph! I'm seein' my family tomorrow, so I gotta get back. Please do it as a favor. Forget it. Get out. Please, for the sake of world peace. You owe me $1238.45. Oh man! Wait, what? What's the big idea! Wait a minute! So you wanna race, huh? You're a racer? My friend's cousin is. Where are we goin'? Mom. Mom. You know anything about him? Not a bit. Huh? Rooster! She's finally tellin' us her secret! This is great! That Rooster's clever. What better place to hide something shiny? It was right in front of our noses all along! That thing is as big as a dinosaur egg! We're done here. Time to get you back to school. Camping is over. Time for some bang-bang. - Hang on tight, kiddo. - Okay. GO! That bum is still alive. Jigen! Jigen! Watch it! Can I call it the day? It's only a few miles more to the Grand Canyon. Is that so... Thanks for all the help. Same to ya. To bad we ran out of gas... How much do I owe you? Well, that'll be... $4385.20. Send the bill to the ICPO, including the tip. What! Don't forget the receipt. Hello? Yes? I've finally caught you, Lupin! Jigen, were you trying to drink the Colorado River dry? Goemon, weren't you in Alaska? Yes, but the lady wanted to see the Grand Canyon. J-Jigen Daisuke. N-Nice to meet you. I'm Isabelle. Are you a friend of Goemon-sama? More or less. Really? That's a wonderful thing! You bastard. What kind of training were you doing? We met on the train. You got the hots for her, huh? What, I do not. That's right. So you know what to do. You know what I mean! Just do it, will you! And it's Zenigata. ZENIGATA! Well, so anyway, a chopper will be here either tonight... or tomorrow morning to take him to New York. Keep an eye on him 'till then. So this is that notorious Lupin. Yes. At any rate, we're going for a bite. For all these years I pursued Lupin. How I've dreamed of this day! Lupin has really gotten so low. To kidnap a kid... Don't worry sonny. You're safe with me. What's going on? Lupin! Why you! You can't escape from me! NEW ORLEANS Why do we come to New Orleans? Isabelle wanted to hear Dixieland jazz. Huh? Goemon's head over heels over her. He considers himself her bodyguard. It ain't easy when the dame's a real high class. You gotta put her up in a better hotel than this. Some dudes are after her. Besides, I've got business here in New Orleans. I know a friend here who'll pay generously for the Super Egg. Rooster's share is one-third. I want to send the cash to his widow and kid. Lemme see that Super Egg. Sorry, Jigen, but I don't have it here with me. Cheers. The white horse really suits your beauty. A friend of Goemon- san is a friend of mine. Well, Goemon's chick is my... AHEM! It's unfair. I don't like it! This is the key to your room. It's unfair. And this is ours. I don't like it. It's unfair. It can't be helped, Lupin. After all, he's her bodyguard. I don't like it. Stop making a fuss. Good night. Unfair. Ring, ring, ring. Is this Isabelle- san? This is Lupin. Go ahead. You can have this back. We're finally alone. No, up there. I knew it was too good to be true. I wanted to be alone with you, too. I must talk to you about something. Eh... Yes? If you're selling it, why not sell it to me? Eh... I'm talking about the diamond, the Super Egg! I'm a traveling jewelry collector. I'll buy anything unusual. What do you think? Then, Lupin-san, tell me... Tell me where you hid the diamond. You fool! Don't kill her! We're to capture her alive. So the Three Masons are also after Isabelle. I think I got a fever. Are you okay? I guess so. How about... If I take Goemon's place for a few days? It's hard on him to do it every day. I've... placed myself entirely in Goemon's hands. I see. Why you! I'll take care of her! Lupin, I thought you had enough women. NEW YORK The Statue of Liberty has finally returned... from the Grand Canyon where it was found. Why are we in New York? Yeah, with the Three Mason's headquarters right in town... and the cops looking for the Statue of Liberty thieves... isn't it kinda risky, Lupin? I gave that kid the same gum. We'll be able to locate each other if we're separated. He's heading this way along with the Super Egg. So you gave it to him. We have a deal then? It'll cost you. We incurred a lot of expenses. Fine. I'll pay in cash. Tell me why the Three Masons are after you, and you'll get 15% off. No thanks, I can't. You have the devil's luck. You were spared. We have a perfect job for you. Nothing strenuous, I hope. Only Lupin's friend can do it. NEW YORK - GRAND CENTRAL STATION We're finally here, Michael-kun. Wake up. That's it. Excuse me, I was job shortage as a result for me for years... Oh, please sit down, okay, okay. Thank you. Excuse me. I have to go pee. Yeah, okay. Here I go. Howdy, Michael. He sure is taking long. Okay, Michael, lemme see it. Okay! Tah dah! I'll buy you an ice cream. Peppermint. Is he asleep? Yeah. It's all over once the cash changes hands. Guess so. Hi, Lupin. Fujiko? Give me a ride. Oh, okay. What's gotten into you? No questions. Hey, hey, Lupin, how come, how come she was flying? I dunno... Fujiko. She's asleep. What is this, the twilight zone? C'mon. Let go, Fujiko-chan. I got work to do. She's out cold. It's cash. Count it. Check your diamond. Fujiko. I'm taking the woman, the diamond, and the cash! Stay back! Stay down kid and don't move! Mom! What did you say? Mom! Mom! Moooom! Mom! What the...? Your mom's a hottie, ain't she, Michael? Imagine a computer whiz kid like you lookin' for his mommy. My mom is the one who created the Neovirus. What the...? She's a computer scientist. She left home soon after I was born. According to my grandpa who raised me, Mom was a fine scientist. When I used my computer to gather data on my mom... that's when I learned that she developed the Neovirus. And so you came to me to try to find her? If you find her, what will you do? Let her take care of you? You're wrong! I'll tell her, "I hate you!" Because, she abandoned me. I see. Lupin. Who are you? Bastard. I'm holding Isabelle. I'll exchange her for the Super Egg. If you say "no," I'll kill her. Where and when do you want to meet? At our headquarters. Tomorrow at 10 am. Long time no see, Lupin. It's been a while, Isabelle. You're as beautiful as ever. I mean it, Isabelle... No, Number 2. Thanks for the compliment, but I still hate your guts. Don't talk big. Once you've betrayed us, you're no longer Number 2, but just a woman. And once we have the Super Egg, we'll also have... the Neovirus, and then you're no good to anyone. Why don't you beg for your life? You fool! Why are you still listening to that fossil? You know what I had in mind when I betrayed the Masons. I can't do it. Sure you can. How could I ever do such a thing? I have the expertise in computers. And you have the capabi lity to run the Masons. Why don't we join forces? Don't you want your mommy's kiss, boy? Let him go, Jigen. He blames himself for Isabelle getting abducted. He can do better than that woman with a kid. Talk about lucky. No way! I'm no babysitter! Fujiko, we can't take him along. No way. C'mon. Wait here with Michael. Forget it. Don't worry, Michael. We'll bring your mommy back. It's time, Lupin. Love ya, Fujiko-chan. Thanks, bye! Not that much! It's a waste to give it to them. See ya later! Who's there? It's Isabelle, Silverman-sama. That can't be. Who let you out of your cell? How did you get in here? I want to atone for my sins. Please open the curtain and let me in. I trusted your computer genius and made you Number 2... but you forgot everything I did and betrayed us. What do you want? The throne of power? Don't think you have everything coming to you just because... you're brilliant and beautiful. That's where you're wrong. Beauty is beauty and nothing more. Isabelle... The world shall be in our hands. Now you're Number 1 and I'm Number 2. Jimmy-sama! Jimmy-sama! What is it? We caught an intruder... and another is on the loose. Fools. I'll be right there. Goemon-san. Are you going to kill me? Love is cruel. The snow of Alaska was beautiful. I'm sorry. There he is! Out of my way! I shall do what I must. I was expecting you. Where am I? Would you believe me if I said Disneyland? We're a minute and 15 seconds late. Let's have Isabelle back. We'll keep our end of the bargain. Okay. Now, the diamond... Sure thing. Don't even think 'bout it, Lupin. That goes for you too, Jigen. You two have been good to me. You're welcome. Goodbye. There's one more coming. As they say, evil cannot live forever, Lupin. They also say the good die young. I hope I make it. So close, but still so far. How's this trick? He made it! Hey, Lupin, what about us? Look after your own backs, I'm out of fuel. I'll come back for you... If I can. My, my, my! Our Number 1 is simply stunning. You'll conquer the world with your beauty... aided by the power of the Neovirus. Don't touch me. I have to take Isabelle back with me whether she's a Mason or not. But first, explain the connection... between the Super Egg and the Neovirus. Figure it out yourself, airhead. All right, all right! The diamond originally belonged to the Three Masons. But Isabelle took it and disappeared... once the Neovirus was completed. She hid the data from us. Where? Inside the diamond? No. If that's the case, we'd just go after the diamond. But we must have both her and the Super Egg. So, knowing that she wouldn't be harmed... she set her sights on the world, with the Neovirus as her weapon. She's a frightening woman. So, where's the data on the Neovirus? You couldn't imagine... how truly powerful that virus is. I want the power of the Neovirus! Huh, strange... Super Egg, open the door of my heart... and bring forth the world's most powerful program! I see now... self-hypnosis. She hid the data where no one else has access... in the depths of her subconscious. The Super Egg is the key that unlocks her subconscious. Heh, look at her imitating the Statue of Liberty! Arrange the following words, symbols, formulas, sounds and images... into infinite combinations, and record them. The Legend of the horseman, chapter 628.71: "Thrust the crystal dagger into the breast of thy beloved!" "The Swan's betrayal has contaminated the evening air." Record these words a hundred times. Play Amadeus Mozart's Requiem in D Minor. Record these tunes. Alliyah. Alliyah. Alliyah... Analyze the following images and arrange them on 4-D coordinates. You've done it, Isabelle! Now, we, the Three Masons have nothing to fear. - Jimmy. - You must be exhausted. Leave the rest to me. Isabelle, watch out! Rest peacefully. Oh no! The world shall be in my hands. Isabelle! Lupin! Isabelle! Lupin! - Out of the way! - Kill him! Kill Lupin! Do I have to do everything around here? Right on! Let's go! You can't go. You guys will pay for this. Stop! Go to the roof. There's a helicopter there. Roger. It's no use taking me. I won't make it. You fool, Michael is waiting. Michael. We gotta hurry. Now is your chance to tell her off, Michael. You've grown. Yes. Hmm? Yes. Just "yes?" Yes. It's nice to see you. Yes. Mo... Uh huh! Mom! Michael. Mom! Yes, Michael? - Michael! - Mom! It's not my day. Just when I'm finally Number 1, and the world was going to become mine. But I won't die without unleashing the... power of the Neovirus upon the world. Neovirus has infected the Pentagon's computers. Now, the Soviet High Command computers. Infection successful. Ready to launch U.S. missiles. Ready to launch Soviet missiles. What's going on, Michael? It's an emergency alarm. Not good. Both the U.S. and the Soviets... are issuing a worldwide emergency alert. Launch buttons have been activated at... all U.S. and Soviet missile bases. T-Minus 120 seconds before launch. Probable cause: Computer virus infection. Route of infection unknown. If the missiles are fired, the chance... of mankind's survival is 0.0018%. T-Minus 110 seconds before launch. 109... 108... It's Jimmy! He's using the Neovirus! I must do something. Once they're launched, it's all over! Mom, I'll go! Leave the computers to me! Michael. I'll come with you. I'm going too! Me too! T-Minus 90 seconds before launch. T-Minus 89... T-Minus 88... T-Minus 87... - Go, Michael. - Right! Curse you... Big Daddy, you've done enough. How's it going, Michael? What the... Let's see... T-Minus 32... 31... 30... Anything I can do to help, huh, Michael? T-Minus 25... 24... 23... Those buttons, I can't reach them! No problemo. T-Minus 19... 18... 17... Right... left! The last one's up there! Go for it Michael! - We did it! - Yay! We did it! We did it! All right! Right on! Hurry. The self-destruct button has been pushed. I'd better get outta here. Lupin, hurry, hurry! Goemon-san. You're much like Michael's father, the man who was my first love. Michael. Give mommy a kiss, Michael. Mom. Mom. Mom! Mom! Mooooom! Isn't she beautiful, Michael, just like your mommy? YOU IDIOT! Forget it. You'll never make it. I saw Isabelle's data with my own eyes. There's no reason why I shouldn't be able to recreate it. What the- Are you still at it? I'm in debt up to my ears, and the cops got all my data. I need that Neovirus! I'll do it no matter how long it takes. So you're not interested in a job, huh? Not right now. How 'bout me? What's the job about? You opportunist. What's the matter? Do you want the job, after all? No. Once I have the Neovirus, I can pay off my debt and make a bund le. I'm not interested in your cheap jobs. So Goemon's back in Alaska? Yep. He's starting his training from scratch.
