I'LL GET HIM TO OPEN UP, BUT HE'S GOT VERY SEVERE PROBLEMS, AND WE KNOW WHO TO THANK, DON'T WE? HUH? YOU KNOW, HIS PARENTS. 32. THE STATE REQUIRES YOU TO TAKE A WRITTEN TEST TO DRIVE A CAR, BUT ANY MORON CAN BECOME A PARENT AND JUST DESTROY A CHILD'S LIFE. IT'S LIKE PEOPLE HAVE BABIES ON A WHIM.

[GLASS HITS FLOOR] I'M SORRY. ARE YOU O.K.? YEP. YEP. WHAT AN IDIOT. LEAVE THAT. GOT IT. SHE SAID SHE WANTED... SHE, UH... CHRISTINE WANTED A BABY. SHE WAS HUNGRY FOR SEED, SO I CLOSED THE IRON DOOR, DENIED HER MY ESSENCE. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT READY TO BE BIOLOGICALLY EXTRANEOUS. SHE WOULD HAVE DEVOURED ME FROM THE HEAD DOWN, CHEWED UP MY MANHOOD, SWALLOWED MY YOUTH, AND GOBBLED ME UP LIKE SOME PRAYING MANTIS. NOT FOR ME. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, PRAYING MANTIS? THE FEMALE MANTIS, AFTER SHE HAS SEX WITH HER MATE, SHE EATS HIM. OH, YEAH. BUT CHRISTINE WASN'T PREGNANT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? NO. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? LIKE ON THE SLY? ON THE SLY, OR, YOU KNOW, IN THE RUN OF THINGS. ON THE S... NO. I MEAN, CHRISTINE HAS HER FAULTS, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD DO THAT. THAT'S A KNIFE IN THE BACK. YEAH. YOU KNOW, THAT'S... NO, OF COURSE NOT. THAT'S SOME VOODOO WOMAN WHO PUTS PINS IN HER DIAPHRAGM. HA HA. SPOOKY, SAM. THAT'S A SHE-SNAKE. THAT'S LIKE THE MOST HATEFUL, CRUEL, SNEAKY, HORRIBLE THING YOU CAN DO.

NO, WHAT I'M SAYING IS I THINK IT'S SUCH BALONEY AND SUCH A CLICHE THAT THE ARTIST HAS TO BE MESSED UP AND HAVE A LIFE OF DEPRIVATION, BE AN ALCOHOLIC OR DEPRIVED IN SOME WAY. IT'S HOW YOU USE, OBVIOUSLY, WITH IMAGINATION AND PASSION WHATEVER IT IS... I LOVE YOU. WELL, THAT'S NICE. I THINK YOU'RE GREAT. MARRY ME, CAPTAIN RENALDO. WHO'S CAPTAIN RENALDO? WE'LL HONEYMOON IN PARIS. WELL, I'M NOT SURE. IT'S KING STANISLAUS' DAUGHTER, ISN'T IT? YOU'RE MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER! WHO? DON'T DENY IT! I SAW YOU TWO KISSING! BRUTE! SHE HIT ME. SHANNON, NO HITTING. O.K. YOU RUN ALONG. GO PLAY. WE'LL TALK LATER. YOU WEASEL! OH, GOD. I AM SO SORRY ABOUT THAT. SHE'S BEEN READING HARLEQUIN ROMANCE NOVELS, AND SHE'S JUST OBSESSED WITH IT.

GAIL AND I ARE GOING TO HAVE A NEW BABY. [UNDER HIS BREATH] OH, SHIT. NOT ANOTHER ONE. SO I'D LIKE TO MAKE A TOAST. TO MY WIFE, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PREGNANT WOMAN IN THE WORLD. LOVE YOU. HEAR, HEAR! YOU COULD BE THE TOUGHEST GUY, BUT WHEN YOUR CHILD LOOKS INTO YOUR EYES AND THAT CHILD KNOWS YOU'RE THEIR DAD... SUDDENLY IT SMILES. IT'S LIKE... I CANNOT EXPLAIN IT. IT'S LIKE MAGIC. IS IT MAGIC WHEN THEY DO THAT LITTLE DRIBBLE OF VOMIT DOWN YOUR SHOULDER? I'M SORRY IF WE'RE BORING YOU, PAL. JUST A JOKE. O.K. JUST FORGET IT. THE GUY IS RUDE. SORRY. WHAT DID YOU SAY? YOU ARE RUDE. RUDE? YOU THINK I'M RUDE? YES, I DO. I'M SORRY... IT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY. LET'S JUST DEAL WITH THIS ACCUSATION. LIKE AN IDIOT, I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION YOU WERE MONOPOLIZING THE CONVERSATION. I'M SORRY IF I'M A LITTLE EXCITED ABOUT MY WIFE AND I HAVING ANOTHER BABY. IS BEING EXCITED A REASON TO EXCLUDE EIGHT PEOPLE FROM CONVERSATION? I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS WAS A FRICKIN' GROUP THERAPY SESSION! HOW MUCH DO I OWE? YOU DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE A CRASHING BORE. I'LL WALK OVER THERE AND KICK YOUR BONY LITTLE ASS! I'LL HAVE MY 5-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER DO IT! LET'S DROP IT. MARTY, HE DOES HAVE A POINT, BUT JUST DROP IT. SEAN, HE'S A DICK, AND YOU'RE AN EVEN BIGGER DICK FOR TAKING HIS SIDE OVER FAMILY. YOU AND GAIL USED TO BE INTERESTED IN POLITICS, MUSIC, ART. NOW IT'S NOTHING BUT KIDS, KIDS, KIDS. MY KIDS ARE VERY MEANINGFUL TO ME. WHEN MY FIRST WAS BORN, IT WAS MY MOST EXCITING MOMENT. I FELT LIKE I REALLY MADE A CONTRIBUTION TO THIS WORLD. ABSOLUTELY. CONGRATULATIONS. THE WORLD IS OVERPOPULATED. OUR SOCIETY HAS TOO MANY STARVING CHILDREN. I WOULD SAY OUR SOCIETY HAS TOO MANY STARVING ARTISTS. IT HASN'T BEEN LUCRATIVE. THAT'S TRUE, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WHAT I DO ISN'T RESPECTABLE. VAN GOGH, WHILE HE WAS LIVING, DIDN'T SELL ONE PAINTING. NOW HIS STUFF GOES FOR $40 MILLION. HOW LONG WILL YOU HAVE TO BE DEAD BEFORE YOU CAN PAY THAT PHONE BILL? DO YOU COME HERE TO RUIN MY WEEKENDS AND EMBARRASS ME AT MY HOME? YOUR HOME? THIS ISN'T YOUR HOME. IT WAS OUR PARENTS' HOME! YOU AREN'T MAKING ANY CONTRIBUTIONS. YOU'VE GOT NO WIFE, NO KIDS. YOU INSULT YOUR ONLY FAMILY. YOU KEEP THIS UP, YOU'LL DIE ALONE, LIKE A DOG, LIKE A BUM, LIKE VAN GOGH. HEY, DOC, YOU ALL RIGHT? [SNAPPING FINGERS] ARE YOU O.K.? YEAH. WHAT? YOU DON'T LOOK GOOD. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO PUKE. NO, I'M FINE. THANK YOU, TRUMAN. I WAS JUST LISTENING TO WHAT YOU WERE SAYING. INTERESTING. THAT WAS A KEY SENTENCE. WOULD YOU MIND REPEATING IT JUST SO I CAN GET IT DOWN? YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE. RIGHT. AND DAD'S A BASTARD! YEAH. RIGHT. I CAN'T BE A FATHER. I CAN'T. I CA... I... I... WHY WOULD I WANT TO HAVE A CHILD? JUST SO HE CAN CALL ME A BASTARD IN 10 YEARS' TIME? WE'D HAVE TO MOVE OUT. WE DON'T HAVE SPACE FOR A CHILD. REBECCA AND ME, WE'RE WONDERFUL TOGETHER. IT'S JUST INSANE TO SPOIL IT. JUST THE TWO OF US... THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE. THIS BABY IS NOT A GOOD IDEA. THAT'S WHAT I'LL TELL HER. BECK. HI. BE RIGHT THERE. [REBECCA] JUST STAY BACK. BYE-BYE. I'LL TELL HER NOW. HI. BECK. LISTEN, BECK... SAMUEL, I'VE BEEN THINKING... NO. WAIT. WAIT. THIS PREGNANCY WAS AN ACCIDENT. IT TOOK US COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE. RIGHT. WE'VE BEEN DOING REALLY GREAT TOGETHER, AND A BABY WOULD CHANGE EVERYTHING. I SUPPOSE IT COULD. OUR APARTMENT'S NOT READY FOR A BABY. NO. WE'D HAVE TO REDECORATE. YEP. I'D HAVE TO QUIT MY JOB. NOBODY WANTS A PREGNANT DANCE TEACHER. WE'RE NOT READY FOR A CHILD. THERE'S NOT ONE GOOD REASON TO KEEP THIS BABY. BUT I STILL WANT TO. RIGHT. MAYBE IT'S CRAZY, BUT I FEEL IT LIVING INSIDE ME. OH...

WE COULD USE YOU AT THE CAR LOT. [GAIL] IT'S SO EXCITING! [MARTY] WE'RE HAPPY FOR YOU. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? I'M O.K. A LITTLE TIRED. EVERYBODY GETS TIRED, BUT THE WHOLE THING IS JUST A LIFE-CHANGING EVENT. I'LL GIVE YOU MY NUMBER. WE CAN GO BABY SHOPPING. YOU'VE GOT TO GET THAT BOOK, WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING. AND WE'VE GOT VIDEOS OF ALL HER BIRTHS. YOU'VE GOT TO FILM YOUR FIRST. THAT'S THE BEST. IT'S THE BLOODIEST... BLOOD EVERYWHERE, THINGS SHOOTING OUT, PEOPLE SCREAMING, STUFF GETTING TORN AND SEWED TOGETHER. IT'S LIKE A GOOD WORLD WAR II MOVIE. WILL YOU KEEP THE CAR? YEAH. IT'S FINE NOW. COST A BIT OF MONEY. BUT IT ONLY SEATS TWO PEOPLE. IT ALWAYS DID. BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BABY. YOU COULD NEVER FIT A CAR SEAT IN THERE. LISTEN, STOP DOWN BY THE LOT. I'LL MAKE YOU A GOOD DEAL. ALL RIGHT? GREAT. HONEY, WE GOT TO GO. BAD CHINESE... BUDDY! COME ON, BABY. LET'S ROLL. SEE YOU GUYS. O.K. I HATE HIM. I LOATHE HIM. HE TRIED TO SELL ME A NEW CAR. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? TACKY OR WHAT?

WELL, NO, BUT MAYBE YOU COULD GET A CAR. ON MY SALARY? COME ON. WELL, PUT IT THIS WAY. I'M NOT GETTING RID OF THE CAR. WHAT ABOUT THE CAT? HUH? WHAT, YOU BELIEVE DR. ZHIVAGO IN THERE? THE MONKEY DOCTOR? HE'S RIGHT. I'VE READ ABOUT IT. CATS CAN BE DANGEROUS FOR A BABY. THEY CAN SUFFOCATE THE BABY, CLAW THE BABY. SKIPPY IS 16. HE CAN BARELY MOVE. HE'S HALF-BLIND. HE'S TOO WEAK TO SUFFOCATE ANYONE. WHAT ABOUT HYGIENE IN THE KITCHEN? YOU GET CAT HAIR AND CAT SALIVA. YOU SAID THAT THIS BABY WOULDN'T CHANGE OUR LIVES. NOW I HAVE TO SELL MY CAR AND GET RID OF MY CAT. AND OUR LIVES ARE PRACTICALLY UNRECOGNIZABLE! I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ASKING US ALONG. I'M HOPING THIS WILL GET SAMUEL EXCITED ABOUT HAVING A BABY. OH, YEAH. SURE. YEAH, 'CAUSE, UM, IF THINGS DON'T CHANGE, I'M THINKING ABOUT LEAVING HIM. OH, YEAH. YEAH. SURE YOU ARE. I THOUGHT ABOUT LEAVING MARTY ALL THE TIME, BUT THIS IS HIS FIRST TIME. YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE. HE'S COMPLETELY UNINVOLVED. THIS WHOLE BABY THING REALLY SCARES HIM. HE'S PROBABLY HAVING TROUBLE FACING IT. IF YOU HAVE A BABY, THAT MEANS HE'S GOT TO GROW UP. THE BABY'S THE FUN PART. THAT'S FUN. YOU KNOW. LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF. AH, YEAH! WHOO! HE'S GOING TO LOVE THIS. YOU KNOW YOU'RE HAVING A BOY, RIGHT? YEAH. GAIL TOOK ONE OF THOSE AMNIO TESTS, I SUPPOSE. NO. HOW DO YOU KNOW? I CAN TELL IT'S A BOY BY THE WAY SHE'S CARRYING IT ALL IN FRONT. THEY DON'T OFTEN CARRY THEM AT THE BACK. IF IT'S A BOY, THEY CARRY THEM LOW LIKE THIS. IF IT'S A GIRL, IT'S UP LIKE THIS. PLUS, THERE ARE SPECIAL WAYS TO ENSURE THAT IT WILL BE A BOY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SPECIAL WAYS? WELL, WHEN WE MADE LOVE... YEAH? WE USED SPECIAL POSITIONS. OH, PLEASE. THAT'S AN OLD WIVES' TALE, THAT STUFF. YOU'LL SEE. SOMETIMES I'M NOT SURE I WANT THIS BABY. OH, MISSY, OF COURSE YOU DO. IT'S JUST SUCH A PRIVILEGE. THERE'S HUNDREDS OF WOMEN WHO SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EVERY DAY TRYING TO GET PREGNANT. IT'S LIKE OUR PROFOUND BIOLOGICAL RIGHT. IT'S SOMETHING MEN CAN NEVER EXPERIENCE. IT HAS TO BE AT THE RIGHT TIME FOR YOU, BUT REALLY, IT'S A MIRACLE. AND THEN WHEN THE BABY COMES, THERE'S MOMENTS OF SHEER HAPPINESS. EVEN IF YOU'RE ALONE? I KNOW IT'S FASHIONABLE, PC, ALL THAT, TO BE A STRONG, INDEPENDENT SINGLE MOTHER, AND, UH, I'M PREPARED FOR THAT. I CAN DO THAT, BUT, UM, I WOULD LOVE THIS BABY TO HAVE A MOTHER AND A FATHER. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A FAMILY, AND I WOULD LOVE TO MARRY SAMUEL. UM... ALL HE HAS TO DO IS ASK. OH, MISSY. OKEY-DOKEY. HUH HUH HUH. O.K.
