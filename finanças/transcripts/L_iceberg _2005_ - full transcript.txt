Courage Mon Amour presents. My name is Nattikuttuk. I'm one of the last people to speak... ...my language, Inuktitut. I hope to be pregnant soon. Then I could teach my child Inuktitut... ...and who knows, maybe I could... ...even teach it to my husband. I live in a beautiful country. As you can see, it's Spring. People think nothing happens here. It's so peaceful. But a lot happens here. I'm not talking about... ...the bear hunt... ...or the return of the seals. Let me tell you... ...how I met my husband. ICEBERG Sleep. Fiona! OK, back to work! Fiona? Are you OK? What? I don't understand. Who's she? Been ages since I've been swimming. I was as skinny as you. - Hello, Fernande. - Hello, Achille. Hello, miss. Hello! Is that a lobster? - Hello, Fernande. - Hello, Georges. Hello, miss. I won't say no. My toes are frozen! Hi, René. Sir? 2 ice creams, 2 scoops. Don't move, I'll get it. One scoop, two scoops. One scoop, two scoops. Sailor. Sailor. Could I have a stamp? A nice one or an ugly one? A nice one. Don't move, I'll get it. Where are you? Yes, but where are you? Iceberg. Good news, Fernande, he'll do it! I don't even know his name! René. He's a local guy. It all happened 20 years ago. One day, his sister... ...was playing with matches... There was a fire, everyone died. He hasn't said a word ever since. He can't hear a word either. Don't worry, we'll have a super going-away party. We'll invite the multi-media. Mayor's office. Mayor speaking. Just a minute, sir, we'll do our best. Rosalie! Go ask Lola to tell Georges... ...that the red-haired woman... ...is wanted on the phone. - What's her name again? - Fiona. Her husband wants to speak to her. Lola... ...go tell Georges that Fiona's husband... ...wants to talk to her on the phone. No. I'll make you pancakes. Fiona's husband wants her on the phone. Don't move, I'll get it. She doesn't want to talk to him. Lola, tell Rosalie she doesn't want to talk to him. No. Your honour! Your honour! Léon! Nothing doing, ...she doesn't want to talk to him. Sorry, sir, she doesn't want to talk to you. Goodbye and good luck. Ready? Ready? Come on, René, ready? Attention... ready? That's good, Fiona. René, not so good. Children! Mum is back. Sailor. Bastard! Look! And Julien? Where is he? Yes, OK, but where is he? Don't worry, ...it's difficult for him right now. Julien... I'm not coming back. That's OK with me, Fiona. Listen to me, Julien. I'm not going to come back. Whatever, Fiona. I'm not coming back. I don't care! I don't love you anymore! - Me neither! - You piss me off! I do care. I love you. I want you to come back. We'll see. I'll think about it. René! I hope you'll get us out of this mess. And then give me back my wife. And since you're deaf, I might as well tell you... ...pardon my French... ...but since you're deaf... ...I might as well tell you... ...that you're an ugly bastard... ...and I hope you die before me. Sailor. According to my calculations... They look like baked potatoes. This one doesn't look too good. I know... ...your ears are hurting. The heat's coming back.
