The time is gone when mothers used to show moon to the kids while feeding them now they show mobile phones. In a world that is going too fast along with Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter a person is still using a 22 year old mobile phone. Before I introduce him to you I will show you his childhood deeds. Everyone, let's go. Do you want to join a snake game on mobile? No, I will play snake and ladder. -At least, you come with me, Venkatesh. -I will. Outdated! -Six! -Three, four, five, six... Venkatesh, are you fine? Did you have your breakfast and refreshments? -Ranga, let's watch a cartoon. -No, I will play with my doll. Get lost, outdated! Venkatesh... -Mallu, defeat Ranga. -Don't lose. What do we do now? -Check! -Oh, God! Run fast! Coffee. Ranga's friends used to call him outdated and useless. But he never cared. By the way, there's one most important thing. I have to introduce his close friend to you. Their character is almost similar. You can say they are made for each other. Touch me not plant, yes! That is Ranga's best friend. You should think twice before bothering them. -What milk is used in this coffee? -Powdered milk, Supreme. Oh, good! The priest has sent a proposal, will go meet the prospect after new moon day. -Go ahead then. -Here you go, your bananas. -Are you finding a prospective bride? -Yes, Ramanna. -I have an advice. -Tell me. Before the girl, see her ***. If her mom is fat, she will also become fat after 15 years. If her mom is thin, she will also be thin even after 10 years. You can make your choice. No one advised me this, otherwise I wouldn't be fooled. I am not finding a girl and he is asking me to see her mom. He is a passionate lover. Here you go, a banana. You eat well, man. Don't meddle with other's business. Come on, eat it. Don't check. -Sri Ranga, drop me. -Get down, I don't have a spare *** I carry *** in my pocket. I will tell you a joke, a traffic police caught me when I was going and he asked me for my ***, I gave him what I was carrying. -He snatched it! -You are too naughty! -Hey, diabetic! Don't you use ***? -I don't! Hey, why aren't you wearing shorts? Sometimes, when I go crazy I produce a rare combination like my hero. A huge effect with a small defect. My hero is working as a Senior Technical Architect in a multinational company. Even I have updated myself, still he is outdated. -Hi Mr. Amrutesh! -Hey, Rob! How are you? -I am fine, how about you? -I am good! See, we have been waiting for more than a half an hour. The guy who was supposed to give the demo didn't even turn up. -Oh, really? -Yes. Rob, give me five minutes. I'll get back to you. Yes, sure. Thank you very much. I have to lie to so many people because of him. Darn it! Ranga, wake up! Your phone is ringing. Your phone ring is disturbing, wake up! Ranga, wake up! Where the heck did he go? He is not even answering the call. Ranga! Ranga, wake up! Even I can hear it, shut up! Hello? Tell me, sir. Ranga, the American customer is waiting. You should present System Architecture to him. Can't you log in and present it to him? Should we lose our sleep to explain it to them? I will explain it in the morning when they sleep. Hey, Ranga! Sri Ranga! I shouldn't have trusted these people! -Hey, Amrutesh! -Hey, Rob! My sincere apologies, you know that. This guy is stuck in traffic jam in Bangalore. You know that traffic is heavy in Bangalore. Once I get him, I will get back to you. I will be waiting for this. Sure, I will do that. My sincere apologies. -I will ensure that your job is done. -It's common with ***. Thank you. Darn it, how many more should I lie to because of him! This has become my everyday work. She is Ms. Padma. Sri Ranga's mother. She might be old but she uses latest gadgets. She is always cheerful! Her close friend is... Bruce Lee, what's the weather report today? It's 8 AM, it could be hot, cold, and rainy. If everything happens, when should we go out? Now it is better to stay home. Okay, it would be better if you shut up. Oops! -Ranga? -Yes, Mom. -Ranga, piping hot Uppit is ready. -Okay, Mom. -Ranga, wake up. Uppit is ready. -Wait, TMN(Touch Me Not) Wake up, she has added cashews to Uppit. -Uppit? -Yes, it is. -Good morning. -Good morning, TMN. -Come soon. -Coming, Mom. One should be fortunate enough to have Uppit prepared by my mom. I am not so fortunate. You don't have a mouth, otherwise I would have shared it with you. Bad luck! Mom has added less cashews today. Otherwise, it would taste superb! God knows how you can eat Uppit every single day! Darn it! Mom, Uppit is delicious! -Repeat it tomorrow. -Okay, son. Good morning, Ramanna. Sri Ranga, is the demo ready? The customer is waiting. In fifteen minutes, sir. I am lying so much because of you. Darn it! -Sir, Aloo Bonda please. -How many? Worth Rs. 10. Piping hot for you! Sir, what shall I serve? Hello? Venkatesth, I am busy. Will call later. I don't want any disturbance while eating. They don't let me eat peacefully. How much for coconut? This is for Rs. 30, those are 35 and 40 respectively. Stupid people only enquire the prices. -How much? -Rs. 30, sir. -Do you have Touch Me Not? -It has no demand, sir. -Will you take one if I give you? -No, sir. -You can sell it. -It has no demand, so no. TMN! -I will name you as Tony. -Ranga, you are so good! You collect us from random places and give it to people in a pot. You are great! -I love you, Tony! -Me too. Let's go home. -Shall we? -Sure, take me to a beautiful girl. -Hello, are you Soumya? -Yes, are you Ranga? -Sri Ranga. -Okay. I am not sure we will kick off, still I will give you a gift. My favourite pet plant, TMN. Keep it and grow it. TMN! Please sit. -Would you like something? -No, thank you. Okay. Hello, Mister? Sorry, Priest Subbaraya asked me to meet you. Didn't you mom ask you to meet me? -She did. -Oh, is that why you came? No, Priest Subbaraya told mom, she told me and I told you. -What do you do? -I am a System Technical Architect. -It means... -Hold on! I don't understand that anyway. I will go home and check it on Google. Do you upload photos? Which app do you use? -Do you look better live or in photos? -I look the same. -Okay, do you use Facebook? -Actually... -Instagram? -Well... Twitter? No app at all? -I don't. -Why? I don't use any of those apps. I use only this. Such an outdated fellow! If I stay here for longer, she will loot me. Ranga, escape! She will throw me too. Correct. Oh, God! Ranga... -You are responsible for this. -What did I do? -If you were fine, I would be fine too. -What did I do? You are responsible for everything. I am younger than you. One would be better when grown if they were good when young. So, is it all my mistake and not yours? I didn't say that, I am just blaming you. Okay, it is my mistake. Touch Me Not! -Hey, Sri Ranga! -How are you, pal? -Ramanna, two teas. -Sure, right away. Why do you look dull as if the sky fell over your head? We will find someone else, don't worry. I thought Soumya would be soft, but she was too far from what I heard about her. She just asks about Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and some filter. What's wrong with girls nowadays? -Here's your piping hot teas! -Thanks, Ramanna. People order lemon juice also online, you don't worry about all that. -Ramanna, why haven't you added sugar? -Because I am diabetic. What nonsense! Why should we have sugarless tea for that? I have offered votive prayers that I won't serve sweet tea until I am cured. Hope you don't offer votive prayer for your hair! You also offer some votive prayer. You might find a good girl. That no one should get married until I do? -Something like that. -Get lost! Bruce Lee, what about President Trump? Now Trump is a goner. Now only Joe Biden wave! Call from Ramanna... He must have called me to make me jealous. -Connect, Bruce Lee. -Connected. -Hello? -Hello? Tell me, Ramanna. Your daughter's wedding got fixed because my son gave her a plant. Yes, yes. Thankfully, my daughter rejected your son. Now, we got an alliance from a millionaire. Go to hell! -Bruce Lee, block Ramanna. -Ramanna blocked! Bruce Lee, you know, contractors like Ramanna build huge buildings for others but they can't even build a small house for themselves. He is also the same. What's up, Mom? Which serial are you talking about? -I was thinking about you, son. -Why? What did the girl say? Museum piece? Outdated? Getting married is not compulasory. *** and *** never got married. They achieved in life, I will do too. Oh, do you want to become a scientist as Abdul Kalam or a politician like Vajpayee? These are just colourful words! Get lost! Bruce Lee, where is the girl destined for him? Sorry, the Lord of Creation Brahma is busy. So, that piece hasn't been made yet. My ill-fate! Only they are here, not the man of the family. Three heads spoil deeds, so. -The guy is handsome. -Yes, like a movie hero. -After all, whose choice is he? -Yours, not your father's. Not bad, you look beautiful. Still, the makeup does't matter. I will reject the guy because I am Reject Reema! -How is my daughter-in-law? -Oh, mom! She is gorgeous! Aunty, I need to talk to you in person. Me or my son? Aunty, I have to marry him but stay in your family, so... Mind your tongue. What are you saying? My daughter is quite forward, she is ten years ahead of the time. -I can understand. -No problem, let's talk. -Sorry, I am quite straight forward. -That's how I like you. I am not the one who prepared the refreshments you had, it was ordered from outside. We have cooks at home, we also order food sometimes. How do I reject him now? -I have a boyfriend. -Past is past, let's not bother about it. No problem, it is all common. -Aunty, I met with an accident with him. -Did you get hurt? -Not on bike but by bodies. -What do you mean? I don't you to get confused with whose kid it is, so... My son is used to having fresh Dosa, not leftover. If you still want to get married to me, I will poison your food. What a girl! I know what you all are thinking. My heroine is a bit practical. Everyone calls her Advance Reema. She thinks the tradition of meeting the prospective groom is experimental. Her thoughts are advanced, so she weaves stories impromptu and enjoy the person's reaction. Her opinion is that marriage is not about commitment and sentiment. Her family is mentally ill. You will know that eventually. For now, focus on Reema. Am I clear? You should have seen her reaction when I said that. She is known as BBC, she will tell everyone. Did you want this? Let her tell, at least then a few people won't come to see me. -Excuse me, ma'am? Order? -Three coffees. -Yes. -Okay, ma'am. What's wrong with you? Why do you keep rejecting all the guys? His eyes said a lot about his bad intentions. Still, rejecting is more fun than accepting. -So, what's the score now? -49. So, do you want to accept the 50th one or reject it? Let's see who is destined to marry me! Ma'am, coffee. -Enjoy your coffee. -Thank you. -What's your name? -Akshay Kumar. Oh, player! Will you marry me? No, ma'am. Okay, carry on. Poor guy! Anyway, why have you uploaded your profile on matrimony then? So that, I can window show guys. -Your wish! -Anyway... Tenet at 10 PM show tonight. Don't forget. Sure, done! Venkatesh, good you brought laptop. I will share my Wi-Fi password, register him on matrimony. Let's see if I can find someone at least then! Matrimony? Don't do it. Outdated, you will get married only through a technology, not through that Priest. Rightly said, Venkatesh! He won't understand. -Tell me your full name. -Don't you know? Sri Ranga! Prefix and suffix? -Star Group? -Anuradha. Anuradha. -Gotra? -Kashyapa. Kashyapa. Interests? Touch Me Not plants! -Hobbies? -None. Watch while I create your profile on the Matrimony. It'll automatically show you the right suitor. Instead, you end up meeting random girls and gift them a plant. Only to come home and sulk. What a stupid routine! Bang on, Venkatesha! If only this dimwit understood. The world of today orders fruits and vegetables online. Can't believe you can order for a partner too. What stupidity! Why isn't this loading? -Check if the network's fine. -It is. -It's connected to the wi-fi, right? -Yes. Re-enter the security code. This is just like a baby's diaper. The baby wouldn't have done anything. Yet, you gotta keep opening it every now and then to check. It's done. Your profile's been uploaded. Aunty, your Bruce Lee will receive the notifications. Keep checking. You guys are a painful pair! Good Morning, TMN. Did you get some good sleep? Ranga, I hardly slept. I couldn't close my eyes, you know? But why? You slept with the lights on. I called out for you all night. Yet you never woke up. Sorry. I'll not repeat this again. The time is 8.30 A.M. Padmakka, out of the 2500 profiles on the website, ...only one girl has liked your son's profile and has dropped me a message. Bruce Lee! Really?! Yes, Padmakka. The girl's name is... Reema. Reema?! Wait, call Venkatesh. Okay, I will call Mr. Venkatesh. -Yes, Aunty? -Where are you? -I have a good news for you. -What is it? -Come soon, I will tell you. -Oh, I will be there in five minutes. Hope there was water and you weren't thristy. That's why I am still breathing. -Sorry, TMN. -Ranga... -Yes, Mom. -Come here. Okay, coming. Ranga, your mom is calling you. It must be a good news. -Sri Ranga, let's venerate you. -What is all this? -Mom, you too? Come on. -Shut up! Among 2500 profiles, only one girl showed interest in his profile. Let's not delay, let's fix it today only! Son, the meeting is in a coffee shop. Catch her confidently without getting confused. Mom, what kinds of slangs! Catch and match! Son, you should start a noble deed by having sweet. Mom, you watch serials and ads too. No way! Ads make serials more beautiful. Okay, okay. Bruce Lee, wish my son. All the best, she is waiting for you. The traffic is heavy, go soon. Him too! Bruce Lee, you don't have a mouth otherwise I would share sweets with you. Son, wear good clothes and go before the inauspicious time starts. -Okay, Mom. Bless me. -God bless you! -Bye, pal. -All the best, Sri Ranga. Looks like you are ready for the 50th! His profile seemed interesting. Let's see what happens. At least, this time finalise it. Don't reject him like always. Let's see. Where is Cafe Aurora? Idiot, can't you use Google maps? Buy an android phone. Go straight and take a left. Outdated fellow! Aeroplane, tata! Aeroplane, tata! Aeroplane, tata! Aeroplane, tata! Aeroplane, tata! Aeroplane, tata! They can neither hear nor see you guys. -I am not outdated, but you. -Oh, God! Hello? Ranga, where are you? I was enquiring the address, sorry for being late. Couldn't you use WhatsApp? I have shared the address there. I reached, ma'am. I am in the parking. -What happened? -He is in the parking. You guys enjoy the show, I will be there. All the best! Let's see what she does. Sorry for being late. -You should be. -Sorry. I am not sure we will kick off, but I give you a small present. This is my favourite plant, Touch Me Not. Keep it and grow it. Okay, sit. -Ma'am... -Sit down! Ranga, she kept me on the floor. Careless girl! Which generation does he belong to? -Waiter, two coffees. -Okay, sir. -Thank you. -Enjoy your coffee, sir. Don't you use WhatsApp? I would have shared the location. I don't use WhatsApp. -Since when? -Since it was introduced. Strange animal! Okay, I usually talk to prospect's mom. First time, I am talking to a man. I found your profile interesting. There werem't many details, so tell me about yourself. Everyone says I am outdated, but I design the updated software's that everyone uses. Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, these are not my cup of tea. I develop applications for android, but I use basic phone. My theory is mobile is only for communication, not for concern. I am a nature lover. -This is Touch Me Not, my best friend. -Irritating guy! He knows everything about me. He is more updated than me. -Sri Ranga, let's play cricket. -I play only Stick and Cane! -Will you play with me? -Get lost, outdated! Get out, updated! -Hi! -Hi! I am TMN. What about you? Sri Ranga. -Shall we be friends? -Sure. -I love you, Ranga! -I love you, TMN. -You are my 50th girl. -Oh, same pinch! -What a match! -Everyone rejected me but I never rejected anyone. I am like a showroom piece, everyone just sees and takes a test drive but no one buys it. -Okay, five quick questions! -Okay. -Your favourite hero? -Shivarajkumar! When he holds that machete, even that becomes fashionable. Om, Jogi, Mufti, I have watched all his movies. Up to date, I never miss his movies. First day first show. -So, you like bloodshed movies? -No, only Shivanna. I like romantic movies. There's romance in his movies as well, started in Om movie. Second question. -Your favourite food? -Uppit. -Uppit? -Uppit, repeat, repeat. If you add cashews to it, I can have as much as you give. -Ma'am, third question? -Not necessary. This is an interview, you have passed aptitude test. I will decide when and where the next round and update you. Okay? Okay. Excuse me? -Don't you use a card? -No. I touch and feel the money. Okay. -How was it? -Boring! Look at that plant. Such a weird guy! -Wow! This is lovely! -Really? Lovely? -If you don't mind, can I keep it? -Of course! So sweet! So, you finally hit a half century! So you rejected the outdated piece. You know, I have fixed his interview with you people tomorrow. You guys have to decide if he is eligible for third round or not. -Okay, sure. -Sure. Aunty, why do you worry? He will come. You won't understand. What if she also rejects him for being outdated? What if he gives her a plant and she gets married to someone else? Aunty, he didn't take his bike. So, he must be coming slow. Don't worry. Hey, here he comes. Sri Ranga, red or green? God has given the power to accept or reject me. She has kept rounds like in interviews. So, you've to attend the second round interview. -Anyway, did she... -Do you like her? Everyone used to talk only for a couple of minutes but she talked for ten minutes. -Ten minutes! -Wow! I knew everything would be great when Bruce Lee wished him. I feel very comfortable. Let's hope for the best! Best or test, just bring her home. That's enough! I just want her to kick the traditional pot. Naughty Ranga! Do you know why I am happy today? Who else knows that better than me? I am the only one who understands you completely. -You are my soul. -So, I will never let you lose. You are worried about the second round, so here's the SMS. It's her text, you are really genius! She has texted that my meeting tomorrow is with her friends. -I am really happy. -What a jackpot! Meeting three girls at a time! Enjoy, my hero! You are the only one who called me a hero. Everyone else calls me outdated. They know nothing about you, Ranga. You are always a hero. I have to wake up early in the morning. Please switch off the lights before sleeping. -I love you, TMN. -I love you, Ranga. Ranga, switch off the lights. Oh, cool! Like we *** this cigarette, we should share her too. She rejected all of us and hurt us. Just like this cigarette bud... I will *** her. -Come on. -Let's go. -Cover her. -Who is it? Help! Help me! No noise! The boss is coming! Boss, we were waiting for you. You too, Ranga? Sri Ranga! Om Ranga! Look over there. You look at men like objects and not living objects. So, do you know what my final judgement for you is? We used to read a lot of books in our youth days. That could be a naughty book or something else but we never knew who wrote it. But the matter in it was awesome! Now look, this character is SR Bhairappa. It won't be wrong to introduce him as a Poet of ***. He is a famous poet who has helped many with his beautiful imaginations. He has a huge following, but not on social media, in real life. According to him, the real followers are the one who attend our funeral. Social media followers don't count. Now let's watch his story. Mr. SR Bhairappa! Sir, slowdown... -Where is he? -Over there, sir. Come on! Sir, please spare me. I won't do this again. I won't make this mistake again. Please let me go. Sorry, sir. Sorry! Please be seated, sir. -Please be seated, sir. -Please let me go once. Hey, stop! He was hiding in a ladies PG for three days. We dragged him out of there. Where else can I hide now? We caught him when he was proposing to our pal's ex. -Good! -Please spare me... I stole... No, I borrowed only one book. Please let me go once. A mistake should be punished. You must wear a black mask. I would spare you if you stole gold. I would feel pity on you and let you go if you stole diamond. Even if you had stolen every penny I ever earned, I wouldn't care. But you stole my knowledge! -Should I forgive me? -It was an innocent mistake. That is why, -I said that a mistake should be punished. -Right. -So, you must wear a black mask. -Forgive me, sir. -You came to sir to fix Dinga's ex... -But tried to steal his knowledge! We will refax you! -Hey, do it. -I didn't know, sir... -What a background story! -This is just a trailer. Call SRB! Hey, keep the phone! I am as punctual as a clock. -Is he the candidate? -Yes, sir. Hello, sir. -The pulse is fine, but the thing... -That's why I came, sir. -Devu? -Yes. Open it, 000... Take that Secret Night book out. -Does it seem worrying to you? -Yes, sir. The power booster for this body, open page number 19. -Maine Pyar Kiya. -Isn't that Salman Khan's movie? -I said I fell for a city girl in Hindi. -Oh! So, say whatever it is. I loved her, I shared my love with her. Her dad attacked me, finally I married her. Everyone would guess that the villain would be cursed but the villain's curse affected me. Even after ten years of marriage, we couldn't make children. Everyone called me a *** Though I was happy that they weren't blaming my wife I was unhappy within. Then I noticed the library! I read all the books and focussed -on my strengths and proceeded. -Okay. My wife got pregnant in three months. I didn't want anyone else to go through what I did so I am sharing my knowledge with people for the last 40 years. Devu, give him the book. This is just not any book, this is my life. Even if a single word is misread, you will be there -but it won't be there. -Okay, I will be careful. Before breakfast and lunch, and after dinner -read it without fail. -Okay, sir. -Do as he says. -Okay, sir. French Fries! So yummy! Anyway, tell me what happened next. I almost choked! I still can't get over that look, the place, and that get up! -Which place? Where is it? -Kanakapura Road, Metro Station Green Lane, Pillar 225. The warehouse and those four people! I don't even want to think about it. Forget it. So, Silent Sri Ranga became violent in Shivanna style? Yes I am quiet only because it was a dream, otherwise I would have hit them all. Dream or what, Sri Ranga entered your heart. Nothing like that, it's just a dream. Anyway, he is coming for the interview. You attend him, I will go. Okay, bye. Okay, bye. -So, Mr. Ranga... -Sri Ranga. Sri Ranga, you have passed the aptitude test. -So, congratulations! -Thank you, ma'am. -Congratulations! -Thank you. -I am Ms. Priya. -Priya. -Swati. -Swati Muttu? No, just Swati. You are an innocent guy. You will be a goner if you marry Reema. There are two faces to a coin, Ms. Priya. Maybe, innocence is just one of the faces. Jokes apart, we are not here to take your interview Reema has some terms and conditions. As her friends, we will share her demands with you. -If you are okay with those, no problem. -No problem. So... Excuse me? -Hello? -Ma'am, you have a parcel. Where should I deliver it? -I am not finding the address. -Do you know Banashankari BDA complex? There's Sunny Apartment behind it on 15th cross. I am right here. -Oh, door no. 202. -Okay. Okay, you hand it over to the security guard. -Okay, ma'am. -Okay, thank you. Bye. -Sorry about that. -It's okay. Point number one, it's okay even if she loses her sleep all night. If she loses her sleep in the morning, you will see hell that day. Point number two, you should prepare food six days in a week. -Oh, only on weekends she prepares food? -No, no, no chance! Since you prepare food for six days, you should buy her food for the seventh day. Point number three, monthly twice beauty parlour. Weekly once, cinema hall. Shopping mall twice a month and then... Get together with friends, you should give no objection certificate for all these terms. Most importantly, her monthly allowance should never be decreased. -Got it? -Yes, got it. If you are okay with all these conditions, we will be fine too. No problem, Ms. Priya. I agree with pleasure. Yes, everyone works for their family. But practically, they falter at the execution. Forget marrying, since I've started planning, I am saving 50 percent of my money for my wife. So, I am fine with her conditions. -Hello? -Yes, we are done with the interview. -How did it go? -Good. -Then? -He didn't say no to any condition. One more thing, he is already saving money for his future wife and her expenses. What a concept! Tell me if you don't like him, I will marry him. -Oh, will you marry him? -Yes. Anyway, he has passed the condition round. Next is parents round. Let's see what happens. Okay, I gotta go. I will call later. Okay, bye! Okay, bye! He is a gem! Grandpa... What are you saying? Has she put so many conditions? I thought you would bring a traditional daughter-in-law but you are bringing a dangerous daughter-in-law. My ill-fate! No, we don't want her. Let her go. So easily! You wanted a daughter-in-law so bad and now you don't want her. I have decided to marry her! Hey... Venky, what does he mean? What about us now? Aunty, girls apply makeup and all only when newlywed. Gradually, they won't have time even to cry because of your torture so forget makeup! -Are you serious? -You are naughty! You watch so many serials, is this one of those episodes? Bruce Lee, do you know a movie where in-laws have a good bond? Forgive me, that movie never happened and will never happen. It's just impossible! You forgot me as soon as you found a girl. -Switch off the lights. -Sorry, good night! -Goodnight? -Sleep well. Sleep well? -Sweet dreams. -Sweet dreams? Ranga, lights off! Thank God! -Hey, what's your problem? -Oh, Mom! My back! He is always tense. -Dad, why are you tense? -You won't understand men's tension. My father-in-law, your grandpa, he tortured me a lot when I went to see her. -Forget it, he will see it. -That's what I am worried about. Even your dad was selected by my dad only after checking his pulse. Was it necessary to tell her this? Okay, I will call back. Hey, why are you sitting like that? Didn't you go? I am not able to select my clothes. Full confusion! Ranga, her friends and parents have agreed. You have to impress that old man. You can do it, catch him well. Don't talk about him with such disrespect. He is Reema's grandpa. Okay, wear a nice shirt and a Lungi. He will agree immediately. Thanks, Mom. One outdated is going to meet another outdated. Correct! -I am Sri Ranga, are you Reema's grandpa? -Idiot, I am not grandpa. Anything can fall, but I am still standing strong. What's with your attire? Remove everything and come in your underwear. Sit down! Don't get confused, this is how I check. A jaundice patient can't recognise a yellow t-shirt in a crowd. Your pulse is fine, now let's come to the matter. Everyone checks astrology before pairing, but I check bodies. He is Mr. SRB who helps people make children. SRB stands *** Rated Bhairappa!... The great writer! Sex book writer! Would I buy a dried up vegetable for my granddaughter? I have experience as much as your age. You can feed her anything, I am not bothered. A happy family is when a husband keeps his wife happy, that's my theory. Got it? -Are you experienced? -Not at all. You shouldn't use it anywhere and everywhere. Pen might be cheap but ink is always costly. -Have you watched those movies? -No, sir. But I have read books. In fact, I have many collections. ** The book you wrote, The Fountain in Grandpa's Farm. Superb book! Less Desires More Satisfaction! The Spitting Lava! I have read all your books. Great! Today's generation is moving fast with YouTube and Google but you have read my books. Great! So, are you okay with me, Mr. SRB? My consent is not enough, Reema's consent is important. Reema? Reema, for how long would you keep rejecting men? Mom, I will wait till the person I like comes. It could be 50 or a 100 men. That's why, people call you Reject Reema. So what? Let them. Why don't you select some good man? You never listen to me. Mom! -Thanks for coming, Ranga. -My pleasure! My friends, my family, and even my grandpa like you a lot. What about you? Even I like your talks, innocence and character but lifestyle becomes matter, Ranga. After we get married, we have to think about our children too. Moreover, we have never failed in love. I never felt that connection or spark. I hope you understand! It's okay, ma'am. Maybe, you are not destined for me. You use a basic set in this android generation. The whole India is getting digitalised. People have forgotten how Rs. 500 currency looked after demonetisation. But you talk about touch and feel. The list goes on and on, Ranga. I hope I conveyed you. You never know who you are destined for. Forget it, ma'am. It's okay. Forget her, why are you so upset about her? Did that stupid girl make you go through all that only because of it? She talked to you for a long time and after all the tests, she just rejected! Forget it, she has conveyed her feelings. We should respect girls' decisions. Forget it, she has conveyed her feelings. We should respect girls' decisions. Sorry, Ranga. I never guessed she would do this. If we know the results in advance, how would we experience life? Forget it, Ranga. Someone else. TMN, please don't be cliché like everyone else. Sorry, Ranga. Calm down! Dad... Please talk. Please say something. Dad! Dad, look at me. Look, this is the reason God exists. Reject Reema's friend has put a status "feeling pathetic, no help from friends" "after knowing father is bedridden. All are selfish." They deserve this! #friendsare notforever. Now I post a good comment. Get well soon! How about it! You shouldn't enjoy someone else's plight. Hey, Ranga. Where are you going in anger? At least, pay the tea bill. Diabetic Ramanna won't spare me. Hey, pay the bill! Ranga! #Friendsarereallynotforever! -Hello? -Hey, outdated! Are you not on WhatsApp? Hey, who are you? One of the lovers like yo who is betrayed by Reema. -Reema rejected 50 men along with you. -We have kidnapped her. Hey, are you serious? We will *** her and telecast it live for the rest of the 45. You are the only one missing. Hang up, idiot! Forty five people will be live in half an hour. If you want, buy an android phone, download WhatsApp and watch it. -Hello, who are you? -Hang up, idiot! Hello! Shall we take a selfie? Look here. Pal, she is the one who rejected me. Reject Reema! Look at her. I will punch you if you don't pose for a selfie. Pose now! Pal, she is ***! How can I not take a selfie! Please pose for a selfie! Swati! I got a call that someone has kidnapped Reema. Any idea about it? Are you serious? -Let's go file a police complaint. -We don't have much time left. They were four people, the ones who were rejected by her. Wait, wait, Reema had told me that she had a dream like this. -Are you serious? -Intuitions. -What do you mean? -She can dream what is going to happen. Any intuition about the location and all? Ranga, Kanakapura Road metro. Let's go. Fast! -Straight or right? -No, right. -Here, here. -No, right. No, right here. You are taking me round and round. Anything else to identify? Yes, Green Line. Pillar no. 225... -We have to take a right... -This is Green Line. -225... Right? -Yes, in a shed. -200, 201... 225 is towards right. Okay. -Yes. Whom should we ask for? -I can't see any shed. -Ranga... If you give me half address, where should I find? I don't know. -Could be there... -Oh, look at me. -Ranga, look down. -Sorry, TMN. -TMN? -I am not TMN, but Tony. -Tony? -Yes. -What are you doing here? -I will tell you the story later. Four men carried the girl you are looking for towards that gate. -That gate? -Yes. -Sure? -Yes, they went over me. -Thank you, Tony. Let's go soon. -How? They have locked the gate. Shall we jump the gate? Tell me! -Ranga, there's an opening there. -Okay, come on. All 45 people are live. -Let's get started. -Great! -Shall we record? -Sure. God, please help me escape if you exist. Help me, please! -I will go *** -I am the** -Okay, okay. -Good. -Who will record? -I will. You get started. -I will zoom in. -Awesome! -Ranga, what are you checking? -Shut up! -Record properly. -Of course, I will. -They all are here, give me your phone. -Will you go live now? No, give me your phone. -It's an android. -It's okay! Download this siren. Here you go! -Police! -Run for life! Sir, the police is here. Run, guys! They left! Are you okay? Ranga... Reema, I expected that you would accept him, but you disappointed me. There's nothing as updated and outdated in life. Life is all about adjusting with the ones who love us. It's not too late, accept him. Go and have a new life! When I went crazy in 16th century, I created a peculiar character. That was Isaac Newton. who taught, to every action, there's equal and opposite reaction. Not only to God, but he taught lessons to the whole world. Now watch what Ranga's reaction would be to Reema's action. Not just to my friends and family, even I like you. So, why don't we get married? When there's beginning, there should be an end. I like the journey, whereas you desire for destiny. You said I use basic phones, but what's better than video calls is imagining the face of the person we are talking to. Maybe, the new currency notes replaced the old ones, but the touch matters. You are right, you are quite advanced. So, you remained far from me. Do you know why you didn't feel love for me? Every time you saw me, you judged me from your brain. If you ever felt something, I would have accepted you. -I am sorry. -You mentioned our future children. No matter how much the technology advances, the baby delivery remains the same. Thanks a lot for introducing Priya to me. Priya? Sri Ranga, what brings you here? Please come in. Priya, you felt bad that none of your friends visited you, so I came. Thank you. -How is your dad? -He is living in mom's memories. He just lives remembering mom. What do you mean? My dad went into depression for six months after mom expired. He recovered, but last night he got disturbed again. -Can I see him? -Sure, come. I give boon to many people, that's called miracle touch. Everyone can use it but when they use it at the opportune moment, it works. You can call it a miracle or hypnotism. That's what happened that day. When Ranga went to Priya's house and touched her dad the miracle touch worked out. Uncle... Uncle? Who is he, dear? Dad! He is my friend. Please talk to my dad. How are you, Uncle? Don't worry, nothing has happened to you. Don't feel bad, we are there for you. Your daughter and I are with you. You will recover soon, Uncle. Dad, he is Sri Ranga. He is my friend. He approached Reema for marriage, but she rejected him. When he came to know that you were unwell, he came to meet you. -Why did she reject you? -That's a long story. They are into fast life, social media life. I am outdated and they are updated, so she rejected me. Dear, get me a glass of water. She has lost her mother. After I leave, no one is there to take care of her. Don't say that, nothing will happen to you. Here you go, Dad. -Here. -Give it. That's what I am worried about. Don't worry, she will be fine. Not just her, you are also my friend. I will keep visiting. -See you, sir. Bye. -Sure. -Dad, I will see him off. -Okay. -Sri Ranga, thanks for coming. -Don't be so formal. I am really sorry that Reema hurt you. She was sure since the beginning, I got over involved. No problem. If you don't mind, can I ask you something. Sure, go ahead. Will you marry me? Can I get a cup of coffee? I will answer after that. Sure! -Ms. Padma? -Tell me, Bruce Lee. Your son is calling, receive it. -Son? -Mom, I wanted to ask something. Sure, go ahead. A girl proposed to me, what should I answer? Such good news! I am really happy. -Who is she? -She is Reema's friend, Priya. Is it? Reema took you for rounds and rejected you. This girl likes you for what you are. Don't lose her, accept her. Let's get you both married and bring her home. Okay, Mom. Son, if we look for a parking right in front of the mall entrance we'll keep going round and round. We should park the car -wherever we find the spot. -Okay, Mom. You have found that spot, -I am really happy. -Okay, Mom. -Accept her, go on! -Okay, thank you. Bye! -Ranga? -TMN! You here? You gave me to Reema but Priya brought me home. She looks after me very well. I was just a friend till now, from now I will be a fan! Thank you so much! -I love you, TMN. -I love you, Ranga! Thank you. I use only basic phone, I am not on social media. I will never be on social media. I don't have any demands or terms and conditions. If you are okay with it, I am okay with you. I am okay too! We ran away hearing the siren sound. You know, the police department stopped siren sound two years ago. Even I am thinking the same. -Do you all know something? -What? -Sri Ranga rejected Reema! -That stupid? He is not stupid, we are who ran away hearing the siren sound. Darn it! Everything is strange! You never know who is destined for what. You cannot forecast me so easily. SR Bhairappa, outdated or updated love demands adjustments. -Mr. Touch Me Not. -Yes? -You gave Ranga a lot of troubles. -No, no. -I will take you along. -Please no!
