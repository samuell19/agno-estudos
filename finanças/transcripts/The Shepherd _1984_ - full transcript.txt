(water rushing) (footsteps) - Grandpa, when Dad and Lyle get here, can we go for a ride? - How bout right after supper? - You know, Lyle, you really oughta get your hair cut to regulation. (water splashing) No, I'm serious. They could drop you from the team. Not only that, they could drop you from the guard. - Oh, come on. Remember that flight of mine during last year's squadron gunnery competition? Every bomb I dropped was perfect. Nobody could touch me. And there was a bad wind shield during finals. But I came in steep and released just above. It was as if I was hand delivering those bombs. All I can say is that my best happens to better than anybody else. They're never going to drop me. - Hey, what are you kids doing? (water rushing) (dramatic instrumental music) - It's too rough Lyle, forget it. - Go on, then. - Forget it! (Lyle cheering) (loud grunt) (water splashing) (sudden dramatic music) (water rushing) - [Lyle Voiceover] (loud bang) I'm hit, I'm hit. - [Tom] Say again? - [Lyle] I've hit a bird, hit a bird. - [Tom] Lyle, get your nose up. (plane engine roaring) - I can't see. - Hawkeye Two Three. One has taken a bird. I don't know how bad it is. Trying to get hold of command post. Get your own clearance. - [Hawkeye Two Three] Roger, Lee. Good luck. - [Tom] Chicago center, this Hawkeye Two Two. Hawkeye Two One is declaring an emergency. He took a bird through the windscreen. Present position direct to point, one zero thousand. - [Radio Operator] Roger, Hawkeye Two Three. Chicago Center. Your clearance requested at 10,000. We'll tell Des Moines to approach. - [Hawkeye Two Two] Okay, Chicago center, thank you. - Ed? Hawkeye Two One's hit a bird, they're gonna bring him in and approach an engagement runway two three. They'll be here in about 12 minutes. (sirens blaring) (sudden dramatic music) (dispatcher giving orders) (paper slaps) - What's going on now? (dramatic instrumental music) (sirens blaring) (plane engine roaring) - [Tom] Hang in there, Lyle. We'll get you home. (sirens blaring) (dramatic instrumental music) (plane engines roaring) - [Tom] Hawkeye Two One, gear in flaps. Now. Now, get the hook. (dramatic instrumental music) (sirens blaring) (dramatic instrumental music) Okay, Lyle. We're two miles out, now. I'm gonna put you down about 500 feet from the cable. (sirens blaring) Can you see the runway at 12 o'clock? - [Lyle] Having a hard time seeing you. (dramatic instrumental music) - We're gonna ease it on down, now. (dramatic instrumental music) About three-quarters of a mile out, now. You're right on speed. Easy does it. You're looking good. Right on the money. Two Two is on the go. (dramatic music intensifies) (plane engine squealing) (sirens blaring) (dramatic instrumental music) - Got several media inquiries. We'll keep 'em out of here until you got it under control. - Okay, we should have your runway in five to seven minutes. (dramatic instrumental music) (sirens blaring) - How bad was he hurt? - Mostly wind blast, with no debris in his eyes. - Being a sheep farmer, I guess you'll have heard a lot about rounding up strays. - Come on, Miller, give the guy a break. - Okay, okay, let's go on with the debrief, here. Start taxi takeoff went alright... - How'd he happen to get that bird? - Well, he said he needed to update his low level flying. - We're not even flying low level route 16-16 now, because of the bird migration, right? - That's right, sir. - How'd the rest of it go? Any problems on the emergency recovery? - Oh, terrific. Just like the book. (phone ringing) - Yes? Good, well keep me posted. Thank you. (receiver clicks) Good news. That was Doc Miles at the hospital. He said Lyle's in good shape, and he's going to be able to lead the powder keg competition. - That's good. - You sound hesitant. You know if we're going to win the gunsmoke competition, we've got to win the powder keg shoot-offs, first. We need Lyle to do that, don't we? - Well, it's going to be tough picking the men. This has got to be a team effort. (car engine) (doors slamming) - Hi, could you use some help? - Thank you, I would love some. - Could you help her with her tire? I'm still a little dizzy from the accident. Thanks. Ma'am, you are in great hands. This man is a top flight mechanic. - What's so wrong with your hands? - These hands? Oh, no, these are finely tuned instruments. - Oh, karate. Must be a beginner. - Well, there's a diner right down the road. If you care to join me, we could talk about it. - Listen, I don't need to know about it. And besides, I hae a lot of things I need to get done today. - What? Nobody works around here after 4:30. - Sir, I really do appreciate it. I'm trying to get to the base before they close the gate. - Okay. - Why, what's going on there? - Didn't you hear what happened today? - No, what happened? - A pilot came in totally blinded. - Totally blinded? Must be one terrific pilot, huh, Coop? Did he make it? - Yes, thank heavens. - Ah. Do you know him? - No, I don't. - Uh oh. You're going to file a complaint. - No, no I am through filing complaints. This time, I am going to take some action and I am going to do something. - About what? - About the fumes, for one thing. When the wind is right, I can't even open my windows. And the noise is so ridiculous. Our phone conversations are interrupted-- - Look. I'm sorry, I was pulling your leg. - You are Major Martin, aren't you? - Yeah, and I'm sorry. - Yeah, you're sorry, alright. (car door slams, engine starts) (tractor roaring) (birds chirping) - Michael, call your dad and come and get washed up for supper, now. - [Newscaster] There was some excitement in the air earlier today, when an A7D jet fighter aircraft from the Iowa air guard struck a bird during a routine training mission. Here with that report is TV8's Beth O'Connor. - [Beth] For some, today's events had all the drama of a good movie. For others, it seemed threatening. Sheila Ryan has organized an anti air guard committee, and is attempting to get the base shut down. - This surrounding area never knows whether or not an aircraft is coming in for a routine landing, or if it's a situation like what happened today. You know, to us, this is frightening. - A spokesperson for the air guard, Colonel Paul Blaine says today's incident was really no different than routine instrument landing in bad weather. Is that right? - That's correct. We train and practice for this type of incident. And today's procedure came off without a hitch. - Colonel Blaine, I do understand that the pilot who guided the other aircraft in was your son? - [Blaine] That's right. He was the shepherd who led Major Martin home. - Well, it wasn't exactly a normal day as far as the mission was concerned, but there was little danger to anyone on the ground. - Thank you. That was Captain Tom Blaine. So, it looks as if the pilots will return to normal operations, and will forget what happened here today. As for the people who live near the base, they say they won't forget. This is Beth O'Connor, TV8 News. Now, back to the studio. - A movie star! Did you guys wash your hands? - Yes, ma'am. - Thank you, sir. Michael, pray, please? - Thank you, Lord, for this day and this food. And thanks for helping Dad and Lyle this morning. Amen. - Amen. - I can't for the life of me understand why you and Lyle are such good friends. He's so egotistical, he's arrogant-- - He's also one heck of a pilot. - Aren't you one heck of a pilot? Pass the butter, please, Michael? - I'm a good pilot, Ann. Lyle's one heck of a pilot. He's got that golden hand. And he flies the airplane like he was a part of it. - Or so he tells everybody. - Okay, Lyle's cocky. But flying is his life, it's as important to him as the air he breathes. - There's more to lie than flying. - How come grandpa called you a shepherd, dad? Was he making fun of you because you raise sheep? - Grandpa called me a shepherd because a shepherd, in World War II, was a pilot who led another wounded pilot back to the carrier or base when he couldn't make it alone. (knock on door) (sighs) - It's Willie and Lyle! - Here you go, partner, that A7 model you've been wanting. - Woah, thanks Lyle. - You're welcome. - We didn't mean to bust in on your evening meal. - That's okay, we just started, have a seat. - [Lyle] No, we already ate, thanks. - Well, how 'bout some coffee? - That, I can get. Here you go. - Oh, thank you. - What are you planning on doing after dinner? - Oh, I think I'm going to con Willie and Lyle into helping me fix the gate. - Work? (pail clanking) - Why don't you go feed Sarah? - Okay. - Hey, Tom, I was just thinking about what happened this morning. I know the colonel's going to come down real hard on me, and-- - Lyle. Why don't the two of you just sit down and talk this thing out? He's not after you for what happened in 'Nam. - He can say that, you see, 'cause it's his dad. - You know, I learned a lot from these critters when I was down in Australia. And one thing I learned from 'em was not to be afraid of something that doesn't exist. - What's that supposed to mean? - Come on, Lyle, stop kidding yourself. - What? - You're afraid that what we've got spiritually is gonna rub off on you and spoil all your fun. - That's ridiculous. - Oh, come on, we've talked to you for years about what Christ can do in your life, and what have you done about it? - [Lyle] I listened! - Sure, you'll listen. You even bring up the subject. But you're still carrying around that guilt from the war. My friend, you're messing your life up. - Yeah, well at least I'm in control of it. - [Tom] Control? - Control. Just what do you think Christ intends to do in your life if you let him in, make too many demands on you? That's it, isn't it? I bet when you were a child, someone you loved and trusted just shattered your faith. And you built this big wall and posted this little sign telling everybody to keep out, Christ included. Am I close? - Let me tell you something, pal. When you get too old to fly airplanes, you and Jiminy Cricket here should become shrinks. I gotta go. - [Tom] Hey, Lyle? - Yeah? - Think about where you'd be now if you'd nosed in this morning. (wind blowing) (soft instrumental music) - Why doesn't Lyle want the Lord to be his shepherd, then? - Lyle's probably afraid that God'll make demands on him. Or deprive him. Actually, it's just the opposite. The bible says, "We all, like sheep, have gone astray." We've each turned our own way. We've wandered off, Michael, that's what we as people do, we wander off. We want our own way, just like sheep. Even if it means getting in trouble. And sheep need a shepherd to keep 'em from sinkholes and wild animals. And I'm getting cold, let's go see what Mom's doing, okay? Come on. Come on! (soft instrumental music) (door opening) - Honey, your dad called. And Michael, it is past your bedtime. - What'd dad want? - He wants you and Michael to go on a canoe trip. - Far out! - Hey, buster, no more. After devotions you can have a small piece of cake. - You know, maybe we ought to take Lyle on the canoe trip. - You think he'd go if he knows your dad's going? - We don't have to tell him. - You wouldn't! - Well, I'm serious. After what happened this morning, it might be our perfect chance to help him spiritually. (Ann laughs) Okay, partner. What's the verse for tonight? - John 10:3. "The watchman opens the gate for him, "and the sheep listen to his voice. "He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out." - Do you know what that means? - Yep. Let's go down and get our cake, now. - (laughs) Oh, smart guy. - That Jesus is the shepherd and we are his sheep. That means we hear him. - Have you heard him? - No, have you? - Well, sure. - Really? - Sure, you have too. God just spoke to you when you read John 10:3. He told us, we could hear his voice, and that he would call us by name, And that he would lead us. - But that was in the Bible. - That's one way God speaks to us. Through His word. John 14:6 says, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. "No one can come to the Father except through me." Now, what does all this tell us, then. - That anyone can hear God's voice? - That's right. But if we're not in tune to the shepherd's voice, we'll never hear it. - What did Lyle stop by for? - Oh, he thinks he's in hot water with Dad, and he wanted me to bail him out. - And what did you say? - I told him to talk to dad. - What is it between your father and Lyle, anyway? I mean, other than Lyle's "I'm God's gift "to the US Air Guard" attitude? Your father's not a petty man. What's the big secret, can't you tell me? - We go to war and face life and death situations, and armchair critics with 20/20 hindsight sit in their easy chairs and tell us what we should have done in 'Nam. Where were they when we needed their wisdom. I don't need to add you to the long list of people making judgements against Lyle because of what they thought he should have done in 'Nam. - Must... Must have been pretty serious if you can't even tell me. Please? - Alright. It was my first mission north in 'Nam. We had a high-priority target. - Right here. The bridge is on this branch of the Ho Chi Minh trail. It's 30 miles west of Vinh. So be on the lookout for VCs, okay? Hello, Joe. Got the latest intel on our target? - Right here. - Well, I hope it's easy. This is Tom's first trip north. - I don't know how easy the mission is going to be. We got these reccy photos last night just before dark. It looks like the big threat will be this 57 millimeter anti-aircraft gun, located right here, overlooking the bridge. About one click to the northeast. There are plenty of troops with small arms also in the area. Now, your best bail out area will be to the southwest. The Jolly Green and the Sandys will be orbiting nearby if you need them. - Thanks, Joe. Anything special you want us to look for on this trip? - Not today. You'll be busy enough. - Yeah. Okay, here's my game plan to shut down this bridge for a while. Keith, you and I are going to shut the gun down. It's located right here, where these trails intersect? Now this trail is from the bridge. This one, to an ammo dump, right about here. Keith, if I get this gun, put your bombs here, okay? Alright, we're going to come in low, with the sun directly in their eyes. Charlie, Tom, you have 30 second spacings and do a split. Now, if either of us get the gun, you guys are going to have to go for it and be back for the bridge another day. In any case, one pass. One, and get out fast and low. Anyone tries to re-attack, I'm pretty sure we'll have another man in the flight tomorrow. Okay, why don't you look over the route while we're waiting for Major Cranse and the weather, you've got about 50 minutes til step time. Any questions? Good luck. (suspenseful instrumental music) (plane engines roaring) - [Tom Voiceover] When the weather cleared, we went into tactical formation. As we approached the target, Lyle called for us to take up spacing. Then, green 'em up, meaning to arm the bombs. (sudden dramatic music) (plane roaring) I watched Lyle go in on his target. I was concentrating on my position off Chuck, when he said there was ground fire at his three o'clock. (artillery firing) As I looked at my three o'clock, I saw Keith in trouble. - [Keith] I'm taking a hit, I'm taking a hit. (bombs exploding) - [Keith] I'm off to the left, let's go. - [Lyle] Roll out, now. We got the gun. (dramatic instrumental music) (plane roaring) - [Tom Voiceover] Keith had taken hits, so Lyle escorted him home. While we went after the bridge. - [Tom] Ease in to the southwest. (dramatic instrumental music) - [Tom Voiceover] I saw Chuck's bombs hit the end of the bridge. (bomb explodes) So I rolled in on the middle. (plane roaring) As I pulled off and checked my bombs, I realized that earlier, when Lyle called the green 'em up, I had selected my stations, but failed to arm them. (artillery firing) I knew Lyle had said not to re-attack, but we needed that bridge. And Lyle said he had gotten the gun, so I rolled in on my second pass. (dramatic instrumental music) (bombs exploding) (metal clanking) Just as I pulled off, I realized I was taking hits from the big gun. (dramatic instrumental music) (speaking foreign language) (plane roaring) (speaking foreign language) (dramatic instrumental music) (speaking foreign language) (plane roaring) Chuck knew I'd been hit, so he began to circle the area. (plane roaring) (speaking foreign language) (dramatic instrumental music) I got on the radio and gave Chuck my position, so he could call in the chopper. (helicopter whirring) - Where are you guys? I need some cover down here. Come on! (speaking foreign language) (dramatic instrumental music) (gunshots firing) (dramatic instrumental music) (plane roaring) (speaking foreign language) (plane roaring) (bombs exploding) (dramatic instrumental music) (bombs exploding) Okay, I'm leaving cover. (helicopter whirring) Now, I'm going to use a flare. Come on, guys, get down here. (loud pop) Come on, that's smoke, come on. (helicopter whirring) - The chopper arrived and I got out, obviously. - Did you blame Lyle? - I don't know. It was the big gun that got me. The time it took to re-attack may have given them time to recover. - Does your father know about the re-attack? (laughs) Of course he doesn't. I guess I still don't understand why your father's so down on Lyle. - Because he thinks Lyle never got the gun, so he jeopardized two airplanes and two pilots going after that bridge. And one of those pilots was me. Lyle just won't admit that he missed the gun. - Well, that sounds like Lyle, if he did miss. - Now, dad's upset over this bird incident. He's catching all kinds of flack. It's just one more thing, Ann. I guess these people are pretty serious about closing the base. - I think I can guess what you're all out here to talk about today. I'm sure it's about Major Barton's bird strike yesterday. - And the noise, and the fumes. And all the things that we-- - Excuse me, Sheila, couldn't we just address one of those at a time? I know, the area you live in is pretty heavily trafficked by jet aircraft. But our aircraft are schedule to take off after 9:00 a.m. in the morning and to land before 9:00 p.m. in the evening. - Then what is that racket I hear at night? - I assure you, that our aircraft are on the ground by 9:00 p.m., unless we're on a higher, headquarters-directed mission. - Working hard, working hard. - (chuckling) Yeah. - You know, I've been giving a lot of thought to what you said the other day, concerning my accident? - Good. - Hm. But there's one thing that bothers me. I can't quite understand how a person can be a Christian, and be in the military. - Because God has ordained governments to keep order and peace. I'm serious. It says so in the bible, Lyle. Here. "Do you want to be free from fear "of the one in authority? "Then do what is right, and he will commend you. "For he is God's servant to do you good. "But if you do wrong, be afraid. "For he does not bear the sword for nothing. "He is God's servant, an agent of wrath "to bring God's punishment on the wrongdoer." - Really? - Yeah. The stronger a nation's military, the less likely it'll have to fight. - Why do so many have to take of together? - Well, Sheila, our unit's training 45 pilots. And each of those pilots maintains the same combat readiness as an active Air Force pilot. - Are you getting ready for war? - You know, our country was freed by the citizen soldier, the famed Minute Men. And we in the Air National Guard are actually direct descendants of these citizen soldiers. - I get sick and tired of hearing about us preparing bigger and better ways to kill people. - I agree. But living peacefully requires being prepared to protect yourself. Do you oppose programs to teach women to protect themselves? - Of course not. What's that got to do with anything? - These women are not being trained so that they can go out and beat people up. But rather, to protect themselves from bullies. And that's exactly what we're trying to do in our part of the national defense. - How does a person know he's a Christian? How do you know? - John 1:12 says, "Yet to all who received him, "to those who believed in his name, "he gave the right to become children of God." - You say you love God? How does one do that? - Well, when I say love, I'm not talking about a soft, sentimental emotion. I'm talking about a deliberate act of our will. When you love, when you really love, God or anyone, it's going to cost you something. Want you to read something. (soft instrumental music) Here, Romans five, versus seven and eight. - "Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man. "Though, for a good man, someone might possibly "dare to die. "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this, "while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." (dramatic instrumental music) (loud footsteps) - Hi. - Hi. - Listen, do you think that-- - Look, major, I'm not interested, okay? - Now, wait a minute, you don't even know me. How 'bout giving me a chance, huh? - I know you're arrogant. - Well, sure, that makes me a good pilot. - And does being deceitful make you a good pilot, too? - You bet, makes it hard for the enemy to shoot me down. I'm also very tricky. - Are you for real? - I have had many women ask me that same question, must be something wrong. - You are egotistical. - Oh, yeah, uh, you got me on that one. Can we talk about it? - You're persistent, aren't you? - I am, I am. - And I must be crazy. - Well, I would never hold that against you. Listen, I have a short meeting, would you wait for me? - How long? - A half hour. - Oh. - 20 minutes, no more. Okay, what you do is, you go down the cafeteria, get anything you want, put it on my bill, okay? Okay? - Okay. - Okay. Wanted to see me, sir? - Come in. I want to discuss the incident while it's still fresh in our minds. What happened up there? - I had a gunnery mission to Harwood, I thought I'd get in some low level flying time. - You know we're not flying low level because of bird migration. My job is to run this flying program with the highest proficiency level at the lowest risk factor. That low level flying restriction is to reduce a hazard we don't need. And when you broke that rule, you not only jeopardized your own life, but someone else's. - Tom, always Tom. You know, you have been on my back ever since-- - Major. Sit down. You're pushing your limits again. And because of that, I'm recommending to the general that you get a letter of reprimand. You know, I've seen quite a bit of that this past year. You're pushing the weather limits-- - I've never gone beyond my limits. - Major. When you're assigned as flight leader, your limits are the same as the most inexperienced pilot in your group. And whether or not you jeopardize their lives. Powder keg's coming up. You're top gun, you should be team leader. But the key word is team. You don't show some professionalism, you're not going to be on that team. Let alone, team leader. - But-- - That's all, major. - Yes, sir. - Well, doesn't look like you were congratulated for all your efforts on proving your combat readiness, huh? - I get into it with him every time. - What do you mean, get into it? - I could fly a perfect mission, which I've done on a few occasions, and he would still find something wrong with it. He's been after me ever since... Ah, well, did you get all the answers you wanted from him? - Not the ones I was looking for. - Hmm. - How would you like to see what happened to my airplane? - Am I allowed? - Hey. - [Sheila] What did you hit, an eagle? - [Lyle] Oh, it's probably a meadowlark, or a blackbird. Weighed less than half a pound. - Look at all these gadgets. What do they do? - Well, these are my onboard computer controls. You know, this was the first jet fighter to have a computer. Up here's the HUD, heads up display. That's another first. What it does, is flashes my instrument readings on the windshield. Don't have to look down anymore. Over here is my attitude indicator. - Does it tell you when you're getting arrogant? - Okay. - Is this the ejector? - Yeah, how'd you know? - The first time I heard all this was at the Williams Air Force base in Arizona. The young man who told me was a proud, enthusiastic 2nd Lieutenant. His name was Jimmy. I was so impressed, I married him. But he never told me the whole story. He never told me about the pilots meeting in the bar, talking about the jet that crunched into the desert. And he never told me about the body that was scattered in the sand that just the day before, was talking about the son that he wanted. In an instant, our hopes and our dreams just vanished. And then came the telephone calls all over the base, where the pilots called their wives and told them not to worry. But my phone never rang. Only my doorbell. (Lyle sighs) - Come on, let's get out of here. You know, I remember my dad telling me about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. That's only 2,000 miles west of his home in California. He told me about the air raid alerts, when people had to draw their shades at night. One day, he showed me this old magazine he'd saved, and on the back was this advertisement for war bonds. There was a cartoon of a Nazi soldier. Under it, it said, "If they win, only the dead "shall be free." (dramatic instrumental music) Now, maybe your husband didn't die a combat hero, Sheila, but nonetheless, he was training to keep this country strong enough so that kids could go to bed at night without having to draw their shades in fear. - But I hate war. - And so do I. But there's one thing I'd hate more. - What's that? - Losing our freedom. (plane engines roaring) (triumphant instrumental music) Had us on the tanker for 26 minutes. We've got to cut that down below 20. And I thought I made it pretty clear that I didn't want anyone sliding back before going into pre-contact position. You two turkeys were at least 150 feet back. - Come on, Lyle, ease up. - Ease up, nothing. You're making me look bad. I could spend the next two days showing you how it's done. Probably would if I didn't have other plans. (coughing) (water gurgling) (dramatic instrumental music) - Stay here, kids. (coughing) (dramatic instrumental music) - Get Lyle! (soft grunt) (dramatic instrumental music) (water rushing) (dramatic instrumental music) - Lyle! (soft grunting) (dramatic instrumental music) (Tom yelling) (dramatic instrumental music) (Lyle coughing) - [Paul] Tom, Tom! (dramatic instrumental music) Tom! Tom! - I know that one of Tom's favorite portions of scripture was the 23rd Psalm. And I know of no other man who believed more than he, that truly, the Lord, was his shepherd. And now in death, he passes not into darkness, but into the very presence of God. Lying in green pastures, beside the still waters. His soul is truly restored. Tom loved his Lord, and like his Lord, he was a man of action. And I think of 1 John, chapter four, verses 20 and 21. We read, "If someone says, 'I love God,' "and yet hates his brother, he's a liar. "For the one who does not love his brother, "whom he has seen, cannot love God, "whom he has not seen. "And this commandment we have from him, "that the one who loves God should love his brother, also." I saw Tom live that kind of life. And I believe he exemplified the words of Jesus Christ, "Greater love hath no man than this, "than that a man lay down his life for his friend." (trumpet playing taps) (planes roaring) - On behalf of the president of the United States, and the United States Air Force, for meritorious service, I present this flag. (music continues) (model crashing) - (crying) Why? Why him, why? - We have no right. In God's eyes, to go through our lives, dissecting our circumstances, looking for something or someone to blame for our misfortune. - He was your son. He was my husband, he's Michael's daddy. What do you want me to say? Okay, okay, I understand you did what you had to do? You let Tom die? - [Paul] I'm just trying to help you understand. - What good is it if I understand? It's not going to change anything, anyway. - I think it will. I really think it will. God loves Lyle, too. And you're telling me that Lyle doesn't deserve an opportunity for eternal life. Not if it means you have to suffer for it. You know, Lyle thinks that life is a sports car. Prestige, an airplane that turns tighter, and goes faster. That type of thinking can one day take him right into eternity without God. (plane roaring) - [Lyle] I'm hit, I'm hit! I've hit a bird! - [Tom Voiceover] Hey, Lyle, think about where you'd be now if you'd nosed in this morning. - [Sheila Voiceover] And he never told me about the body that would be scattered in the sand. (Lyle yells) (suspenseful instrumental music) (gear clanking) (soft footsteps) - Why don't you take a break? (gear clanking) Willie, you're a Christian. How come you never talk about it? - Well, you're a fighter pilot and you talk about it all the time. Who listens? - Well, you never were one to beat around the bush, were you? - Well, life's too short for that sort of thing. Why do you ask? - I don't know. I was always in control of my life, and now-- - No, you weren't. You've bluffed your way so far, and gotten away with it. - What are you talking about? - [Willie] You're scared to death. - Of what? - Life. You're in a real pickle, my friend. And you must know it, or you wouldn't be coming to me. You know what the answer is, don't you? Except you're scared to death God's going to take something away from you if you turn your life over to him. Well, God does not take, my friend. He gives. He gives. - He took, Tom. - We can't judge God by what he thinks is right. Tom is where he wants to be. Besides, God'll give so much more in return. - Yeah, well, you tell that to Tom's wife and son. - You really don't see it, do you? Don't you realize that's twice now God's tried to get your attention? How many years did Tom pour out his love for Christ to you? And defend you? Who was it that stood by you when no one else would? That guy gave you everything he had to give. Lyle, when you roll in on a target at 500 knots, it doesn't take very many mistakes to nose you right into the ground, does it? - Yeah. I've been thinking a lot about that since the accident. - You know what the bible says about where you're at right now? It says, I think it's in Luke, "You're a fool. "For this very night, your life might be demanded of you." - Yeah. Well, I guess that's what I had to hear. - You need to do more than hear it, Lyle. You need to do something about it. - I need to talk to Ann, but I don't have the guts. - You need to be talking to God, first. - I got to make it right with her, Willie. I can't even concentrate on flying. - Lyle. (knocking) - Can I come in? (dominoes clicking) (model plane clicking) You know, after the bus picked you up for school today, Bobby's mom called. Guess the team isn't doing too great since you retired. - Why couldn't it have been him? (dramatic instrumental music) - Michael. I've asked myself that question a million times. I miss your daddy so much. (dominoes crashing) (somber instrumental music) (soft footsteps) (door opens) (door closing) (soft knocking) (door opening) - Hey. - Hi. - I thought if I called you might not want to see me. - You thought right. Since you're here, you might as well come on in. (paper rustling) Thanks. (door closing) (coffee pouring) - You know, it's funny, you go over and over in your head what you want to say. And the time comes, it's not there. Thanks. I think you should know that I didn't make that decision at the river. - You didn't make that decision at the river? I really feel sorry for you. Suppose I told you it wasn't your fault, would that make you feel any better, major? (soft laugh) As a Christian, I'm supposed to forgive you. I'm supposed to help you, I'm supposed to love you. I don't even like you. I just want to hurt you as bad as you've hurt me. - Ann. - The colonel saved your life, you didn't even thank him. Tom brought you down safely in your jet you didn't even say thank you to him. What makes a guy like you tick, anyway? The colonel's trying to help you. You wont' even talk to him civilly. - The colonel. He's been riding me ever since Vietnam. - (clicking tongue) Oh. - Ann, I'm a good pilot. And a good gunner. Now he has never once, not once, said, "Lyle, you're doing a great job, here." He's just like my father. You know, people are holding me responsible for what happened. You're holding me responsible. It was the colonel's decision. - It was the colonel who saved your life. - Why, why? - [Ann] To give you another chance. - A chance at what? - (sighs) I think you better go now. I don't think I can help you any more. (dramatic instrumental music) (door opens) (door closes) (loud sigh) Please, God, help me. It's not fair, you're asking too much. How can I love a man I detest? (phone ringing) Hello? Hi, daddy. Yeah, I'm okay. No, I'm not okay, I'm miserable. (soft instrumental music) - Lyle. We need to have a serious talk about powder keg. Your scores have been very poor ever since the... Ever since the bird strike. And I'm at a point where I have to name a team leader. Frankly, your scores barely keep you in contention as a spear, let alone team leader. I've given you every opportunity to get yourself together. I have to make a decision after today's mission. - Look, colonel-- - Major. Just get your scores up. (paper rustling) - Yes, sir. (door closing) - Roger, where's L38? - Maintenance control says you'll have to take the spare. - What's wrong with L38? - The aphis failed the self test in pre-flight. - Where is it? - Willie's got it in the hangar. - How's it going, Dick? - Mike's got a problem up here on pin 12. Would you check that one diagram and see what it leads us to? (door slamming) - Willie, what is going on? I told you how this thing was acting, but that it was okay. Now, who did the pre-flight? - Mack, but it failed the pitch check. Now, that's a grounding item, why didn't you write it up? - This plane has been assigned to me for powder keg. I don't want you guys messing with it. - Hey, when it comes to maintenance, we decide whether or not we mess with it. Now that airplane failed a grounding item on our checklist, so we red X'd it. - I know what you're doing. But you guys are like little old ladies with these things. I mean, you scratch the paint, you want to pull 'em. - You bet we do. - Well, I gotta fly this plane today. I gotta turn my scores around. - Lyle, we're not dealing with emotions, here. We're dealing with facts. Now, the fact is-- - Come, Willie, just this once. - No! I had a pilot in 'Nam say the same thing to me. And he never came back from his mission. - Well, we're talking about a career, here. - You're right, a career. Not war. At least, not mine. Now that airplane does not have to fly. If you want to wage your own private war with yourself, have at it, but not with one my airplanes, you don't. You know what I think? It isn't your career, it's false pride. You have to be top dog. It's been a long time since I've felt sorry for anyone, major. But you seem to bring out feelings in people one would rather do without. (sudden dramatic music) (planes roaring) (dramatic instrumental music) (planes roaring) (radio dispatchers talking) (planes roaring) (dramatic instrumental music) - Three hits to the right. (dramatic instrumental music) Six hits slightly right. - [Lyle] Ah, junk. (plane roaring) (door closing) (soft footsteps) (loud sigh) You wanted to see me, sir? - I hate to do this, Lyle. But I'm taking you off powder keg. - What? - Your scores have been consistently lower than our goals. - Now, wait a minute, you know the general's feelings about powder keg. You're throwing it away. I think you're going to regret this decision, too. (dramatic instrumental music) I've decided to take Lyle off powder keg, sir. - Well, how'd he score today? - Up, slightly. But he fouled again. - I see. Does your decision have anything to do with what happened to Tom? - Sir? - Are you thinking perhaps you pulled the wrong man out of the river? You know Lyle's our top pilot, best we have. We need him on that team. - I don't think we can win with him on the team, sir. - Can we win without him? You know, Lyle's been through a lot, lately. And I think with a vote of confidence, he'll come through for us when the chips are down. - Like he did in 'Nam, sir? - Paul, taking Lyle off the team won't bring Tom back. (phone ringing) Yes? Okay, I'll be right over, thank you. I've got another meeting, I'll talk to you later. (door opening and closing) (car engine running) (rake scraping) - How you feeling? - Good. - How's Mike doing. - Not so good. - Mind if I talk to him? - He's up in his room. (soft instrumental music) - I guess there are times in our lives when pieces just don't fit together, huh? (soft instrumental music) You know, your dad was a special kind of man. - Why couldn't it have been you? (soft instrumental music) - Yeah, well, I've been asking that same question. And I was kind of hoping that we could help each other. (soft instrumental music) - Lyle, there's been a change in plans. You're going to lead powder keg. General apparently has more confidence in your ability than I do. And I hope for the team's and the unit's sake, you're right. Your performance had better match the other guys. Because in the last couple of weeks, it hasn't. Ball's in your court. (soft instrumental music) That's all, major. (dramatic instrumental music) (employees chattering) - Good morning, Harold. - Good morning. - You've got the charts here where we can take a look at 'em? - Yes, sir. - Okay, if I understand this right, we've got two targets today. The first one is this flat 23 gun area? - That's correct. (dramatic instrumental music) - As I see it, we have to complete three key events today to win powder keg. Number one, meet that tanker on time and complete the air refueling. Number two, the order of the targets, on time. And three, drop good bombs. Now, remember, we can lose points if we miss that air re-fueling, so we're going to have to keep a sharp eye on the weather. - [Ground] How's the spool run, fight check? - [Lyle] Two. - [Ground] Power? - [Lyle] Moses Four One, ready to take off in sequence. - Remember, now, Lyle has to confirm a hit on that gun before they can go after the command post. I think our guys can do it. I think we'll win it today. (plane engines roaring) (dramatic instrumental music) - [Lyle] Well, Two, better pull it in. Looks like we've got some weather ahead. - [Pilot] I hope we can climb the tanker. - [Tanker Pilot] Moses Four One, this is Petrol Three Three. - [Lyle] This is Moses Four One, go ahead. - [Tanker Pilot] We're at the IP and holding at flight level two five zero, in weather. It looks like it might have improved down track. - [Lyle] Roger. We'll be at the IP in 10 minutes. We'll stay at flight level two zero zero. - Now, we got time and weather to contend with. They got to be at their target at zero nine 47, and get their gas by zero nine 25 in order to make it. - That still gives them 22 minutes to be at the target. (planes roaring) - [Lyle] Moses Four One is out-bound on two four zero radio and 35 DME. - [Tanker Pilot] Roger. Petrol Three Three is outbound on two four zero radio and four zero DME. We have descended to flight level two one zero, still in weather. Looks like we're about five miles in front of you. - [Lyle] Roger. We'll pull up closer to see if we can get a visual. Two? We've got to get a visual on the tanker in three minutes in order to have time to get our gas and still make our time on target. - [Preacher Voiceover] If someone says, I love God, and yet hates his brother, he's a liar. Love God, and yet hates his brother, he's a liar. He's a liar. (words echoing) (plane engines roaring) - [Lyle] God, if you're out there, help me. (dramatic instrumental music) - [Preacher Voiceover] For the one who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. (dramatic instrumental music) (plane engines roaring) - [Lyle] Woohoo! Petrol Three Three, I got a visual. - [Tanker Pilot] Roger, Moses Four One, you're clear for free contact position. - [Lyle] Roger. Two, take the right wing. (dramatic instrumental music) Moses Four One, ready. - [Tanker Pilot] Petrol Three Three is ready and clear for contact. (dramatic instrumental music) This is Petrol Three Three, contact. - [Lyle] Moses Four One, contact. - [Tanker Pilot] Moses Four One, you're taking fuel. (everyone cheering) - Great, that was close. - All we got so far is the gas. We haven't hit the target, yet. (dramatic instrumental music) - [Tanker Pilot] Two, you've got your upload. - [Pilot] Roger, Moses Two, disconnect. - [Tanker Pilot] Petrol Three Three disconnect. - [Lyle] Moses Four One, post refueling checklist complete. - [Pilot] Two. - [Lyle] Thanks for the gas. We gotta run. Next time we're in the neighborhood, we'll pick up our green stamps. Okay, Two, let's push it, we've gotta make the target. (dramatic instrumental music) - They oughta be over the target... Right about now. (dramatic instrumental music) - [Lyle] Four Two, arm up. Target is at your left at 11 o'clock. (switch clicks) - [Pilot] Roger, Lee. Don't mistake the second gun for the real target. - [Lyle] Two guns. That's it! (artillery firing) (dramatic instrumental music) - A second gun. - [Pilot] Speed is up. (dramatic instrumental music) (guns firing) (plane engines roaring) (dramatic instrumental music) (guns firing) - [Lyle] Nice hit! Okay, Four Three, you guys can drop on the bombs. (dramatic instrumental music) (bombs exploding) - [Lyle] To ragpole, this is Moses Four One. One quad 23, and one command post destroyed. (all cheering) - How about that? I knew our guys could do it. (cheering) Well, how do you feel now? - General, I feel terrific. - [General] You have a good flight back to Des Moines tonight. (plane roaring) (cheerful instrumental music) (planes roaring) (loud sigh) - [Preacher Voiceover] And this commandment we have from him, that the one who loves God, should love his brother. - Dear God, forgive me. Forgive me, Lord. Forgive me. (plane engines roaring) (soft grunt) Lyle? You did a good job this morning. - Thank you, sir. - I... I need to talk to you. Not, colonel to major, just man to man. I... I loved my son very much. And I never realized until the general put you back on the team, that I held you responsible for Tom's death. I also blamed you for the fact that he was shot down in 'Nam. - Sir, there had to have been a second gun put out there, after the recon photos, I'm positive. - I know. That came to me as you were talking to your wing man about the target. I've been using you to cover up the fact that my son disobeyed orders. That's what got him shot down. I don't know how else to say this, Lyle, except, I'm sorry. And I ask for your forgiveness. - Whew. You know, something happened this morning. Remember when I couldn't find that tanker? Do you remember what the pastor said at Tom's funeral? For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, how can he love God, whom he has not seen? Well, I couldn't get that out of my head. It was as if God was saying to me, I want to help you, Lyle. But you got to do something, first. And I knew what it was I had to do. My bitterness towards you was the barrier. I don't know, maybe hate's too strong a word. Whatever it was, it went away after God, somehow, helped me to forgive you. And you know what? A couple seconds later, I had a visual on the tanker. 20 minutes later, we got the target. - And the right target, at that. Lyle? Did Tom ever explain to you how to receive God's gift of salvation? - No. I never gave him the opportunity. - Would you give me that opportunity? - Yes, sir. - I always carry a pocket testament with me, so I can share God's word instead of my own. (soft instrumental music) In Romans 3:23, God says, "All have sinned "and fallen short of the glory of God." And over here in Acts 16:31, he says, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved." And, back in here in Romans, it says, "If you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord, "and believe in your heart that God raised him "from the dead, you will be saved." You see, Lyle, it's by grace that we are saved, by faith. Not of works, lest any man should boast. - Well, I guess I just never felt that anything I'd done was that bad a sin. But I see it, now. - Lyle, is Christ in your heart? - I hope so. - (laughing) Some day when you get married, and someone asks you, are you going to tell 'em, I hope I'm married? (laughs) - Okay. - You know, God assures of our salvation. When he says in I John five, "I write these things to you "who believe in the name of the Son of God, "so that you may know you have eternal life." And you know, Lyle? Our salvation is a fact, not just a feeling. I believe with all my heart, that God allowed us to go through this, just to bring us to this point. (clothes rustling) Oh, Lyle. - Yes, sir? - Get a haircut. - Yes, sir. (soft instrumental music) Lord... (sighs) Wow, I'm not very good at this. When I think of all these years that I've wasted 'cause I thought I had all the answers, I'm overwhelmed by the circumstances that brought me to this moment. Please forgive me. And thank you, for sacrificing your son for me. Help me to trust in you, in the name of Jesus, amen. Okay? Okay. (people chattering) - [Woman] Hey guys, nice meeting you, talk to you later. - Have fun. - See you later. - No, no, that's not fair, now, come on. Have I been wasting my time or not? - Does that answer your question? - That's an acceptable answer, yes. (laughs) - And they're all chanting, this aircraft doesn't meet my standards! (men laughing) - Listen, you knucklehead, if it wasn't for my standards, some of you guys wouldn't be here tonight to joke about it. - But you haven't been wasting your time. - How's that? - Well, I mean, you've managed to convince me that everything you're doing here really is important. - Oh, the general's gonna really be disappointed. - Disappointed, why? - Well, when something goes wrong, who's going to call him and let him know? - (laughs) He'll love it. - I thought I told you to get a hair cut. - What? - (laughing) Gotcha! - Excuse me a minute. - May I join you, Sheila? - Sure. - Hi, sport. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. (sighs) Go ahead, give it to him. - It's got my dad's name on it, see? - Ah, that is a thing of beauty. You hungry? - Yeah. - Let's get something to eat, okay? (dramatic instrumental music) (plane engine roaring) (dramatic instrumental music) - [Pastor Voiceover] And now in death, he passes not into darkness, but into the very presence of God. (dramatic instrumental music)
