You fucking coon! Run! Here, boy! Nigger mind. Go black home. Be all white in the morning. Be all white in the morning. Please, brother! Please, brother. Brother, please. He said please. The government and the British people are concerned at the level of immigrants arriving in the country. Enoch Powell has claimed there will be "rivers of blood" if immigrants continue to flow into the country unchecked. Hundreds of black immigrants poured into Tilbury Port onboard the Windrush. There is a genuine concern by locals that jobs... Many British people have publicly voiced their resentment at the recent immigrant influx, claiming that Enoch Powell is right. Disturbances have broken out within the inner cities, as right-wing groups clash with local immigrant populations. Police struggle to gain control as the violence escalated. Nigerian immigrants have struggled to assimilate in their foreign culture. Reports have indicated that many are now taking to fostering their babies out to white working-class families. Many have thought enticement to free education and good jobs are outweighing parental care. Reports indicate that this practice has spread across the entire country, numbering as high as tens of thousands. Over there. Shhh. Fred? What's his name? Enitan. - Sorry? - His name is Enitan. - Eni... Eni... Enitan. - Enitan. - That's nice. - That's... that's a lovely name, yeah. Mm-hmm. And you said he's just six weeks? Yes. - Oh, yeah. - The money, then? - Yeah. Okay. - We are both working and study. It's just until we finish our studies and return to Nigeria. Oh... let me... He's lovely. Please take care of our son. Eni, get from behind there. That's why they'd all better behave themselves and do what Mummy tells them, else they'll all be back on the next banana boat to bloody Wooga Wooga land. I made the tea last time. Do it yourself. Mingle, shut that baby up. Keep your mouth shut. Read this for me, babes. Me eyes hurt. Don't know why you're lying. Y'know you can't bleeding read. "We are sorry... we could not come down again. We are working hard, and we'll try to see you soon." Who's it from? Which one is it? - Eni's mum. - Eni's mum. Blimey. Eni's parents not coming down again. They only live a couple of hours away in London. Too bleeding busy trying to become lawyers instead of visiting their boy. Anyway. Eni really gets on my nerves, Lynn. Thought you liked having the kids. I don't mind Dopey and Mingle, his sisters and the rest of them, but... he just rubs me the wrong way. Y'know, scrounging for attention all the time like he's special. He's annoying. - Aw, you don't mean that, Ing. - She's only jealous 'cause he's happy. No, I ain't. He thinks he's better than the rest of 'em. Look at him. Sits behind there, talking to hisself, saying he's got an imaginary friend. So? What's wrong with that? I got me an imaginary friend and I call him Tom. Tom Jones. I remember your mother telling me you was like that as a toddler. Always in your own world. Don't want none of my kids growing up soft, that's all. - No chance of that. - How much d'you say his parents give you for Eni Ing? £13 a week for him and his sisters. - Mind yourselves. - Plus their family-allowance books. - What? - Yeah, government gives them £5 vouchers per week, per kid. I could do with a bit of that. My Tony's been made redundant again, ain't he? Lynn, you can't pick 'em up and drop 'em as you please. Nah, especially when you got social workers up your arse. They ain't bleedin' toys, Lynn. Right. Divvy cods! Get from behind there. Just needs to be put to work, instead of sitting behind that sofa daydreaming, playing silly buggers all day. Yeah. No more silly buggers. D'you wanna be Mummy's favourite? Do ya? Go on. Shhh. Shhh. - Oi! - Little bleeder! I told you not to touch anything, didn't I?! Git, wait till I get you home, embarrass me like that. I'm sorry. I keep telling him not to touch. I'm really sorry. Come here. We had to do it so we didn't get caught, alright? Nearly got Mummy in trouble, didn't you? Eh? Silly? Got to do better if you want to be Mummy's favourite. Right, you lot, I want this place spick'n'span. I don't want no stuck-up social workers saying my house ain't clean. I have to see if I can get some money out of 'em. Jack, you use that for the bloody dog. I'll use 'em on bloody you in a minute. Get here. It's alright all the bloody same, innit? You don't mind, do ya, kids? No, Dad! Oi, Herberts. When you're done, I want you to get round to Aunty Lynn's. Don't want them knowing how many of youse I got. Mum, how comes Madam doesn't have to get her hair cut? Don't you worry about Madam. Any dirt, any misbehaving, I'll have 'em takes youse all back to Wooga Wooga land. No! - What's that? Ah! - Oh, my God, it's a mouse! Kill it! Kill it! - I can't. - Jack! Kill it. Make it go outside. It ain't gonna bloody hurt you. It's just come for a haircut. We love you, Mum. And what is your name? - Oi. - Madam. Well, you're a good, clean girl, Madam. Leave me alone. No lice or ringworm, and their general health seems fine. - I keep my kids bloody clean. - Mrs. Carpenter, when did you last speak to the families of the children? I ain't heard from his at all. The others, I ain't heard or received nothing from 'em in ages. - The farming phenomenon. - The what? Nigerian families fostering their children out to white families across the country - it's what we term it. They ain't bleedin' potatoes. Why don't you call 'em something friggin' sensible? The practice has been tripling in the last six months. And regrettably, the welfare resources aren't designed to extend to private fostering. - What d'you expect me to do? I got nothing to feed them on. - You can't cope? No, I'm saying I could use a bit of help. If we can't track down the natural parents, the new directives tell us to place the children in care institutions until they're deported to the closet known relative... - Wait. Hang on. They were born here, they're British. You can't deport them. Well, we hope it won't come to that. We all want the best for the children, Mrs. Carpenter. But it's a question of budget. You say your husband is a long-distance lorry driver, away for days at a time. Will he be coming today? We did ask to see the both of you. He's at work.

What is there to think about? We gave him everything. We'll find him another school. There's so many schools out there. Where, Tolu? That was the third one. I don't know what else to do. - Uh, okay, we'll educate him ourselves... - When, Tolu? We are both working night and day. Look, the boy is beating teachers, and he still won't speak. Can't you see there's something wrong with him? Femi, Femi, wait. Please. I'm afraid. I don't want to lose my son again. Calm down. I don't want to lose him, either, eh? But I don't want my son to end up a dullard. If he stays here, we know that he's going to become a ruffian. Please. - Remember what Elijah said. He needs to be here. He has to be here. He told us. But at least if he goes there, he will go to school. And maybe begin to speak again and behave normal. Look at that. There, that one. What's that? It's their religion, ain't it? - "Vooju." - That's wicked. - Ought to report 'em to the authorities. - No, Ing. Lynn. Don't want the school coming over here blaming me. That's another thing. He's already behind in school. Reckon they couldn't find him a school. Kept the girls, set him back. Bloody ridiculous. He's got bruises, keeps carving stuff over me furniture and he won't talk. What ya mean, he don't talk? They said he hasn't said a word in six months. He ain't spoke a word in six months? Like one of them deaf and dumbs? - That's what they said. He ain't half-dark now, Ing. Well, I expect it's the sun, ain't it? Six months of that turn anyone blue. You'll be alright, though, Ing. Run out of electric, all you gotta do is ask him to smile.

This stipendiary enabled your release from juvenile detention. A condition of this stipendiary is that you study law, the same as your Nigerian father. Books have been provided for your studies. Eni? Eni. Eni. It's okay. I know it's a lot. I cannot know all that you have been through, but I do know that every day we get to make a new choice. If you trust me... ...I will help you make that choice. Can't. I believe in you. I believe that you can make this turn... ...if you try. I want us to try. Together. I can't. I can't. Can't. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Eni. It's okay. It's okay. This is your weapon now. No!! Oh, God! It's okay. I'm nothing. It's okay. It's okay. - I-I can't. I'm a coon. - It's okay. I'm a coon. I'm a coon. There's nothing you cannot achieve now, Enitan.
