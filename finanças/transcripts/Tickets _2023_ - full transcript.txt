Speedo, one of these days this whole block will belong to us. We'll talk later. Safe, boss. Fuck's sake. Today I'm talking to Adriaan van Aswegen who won millions years ago when he chose those six lucky numbers just right. But today you're a small business owner. Yes, I manage my own garden services. So you went from hero to zero. Exactly what went wrong? What went right? If anything could go wrong, it did. My family was a bunch of vultures, even family I didn't know I had. I didn't know I had that many friends. Suddenly I had buddies everywhere. I would never be that stupid. I'm fast asleep again. Buy a ticket, man. I'm an accountant, I know about odds. And those odds... Well, I'll keep the R2,50 odd. ♪ Somewhere in my dreams ♪ ♪ I see you and me ♪ ♪ Drifting by without a care ♪ ♪ But I'm afraid to fall if you won't ♪ ♪ Catch me ♪ ♪ So please be... Please be... ♪ Okay, so let's do it again, but I think you should keep that note a little bit longer. Okay? One more time. No, I'm done. We have enough options. -And then? If you don't get in? -Then it's fine. It's fine. So I took the whole day off for something you don't even care about? Hey, you, calm down. I'll buy you something nice as a thank-you. Mm... With what money? I have money! Some... And I have a gig tonight anyway, so it's fine. -Are you seeing Grant again? -He's taking me out tomorrow. Hey, look at you! -But my mother can't know. -Why? Because she wouldn't like it. He's much older than me. It's not like he's a sugar daddy, it's a five-year gap. That's enough to make her faint! -But you like him, don't you? -Oh, he's alright. Don't talk shit! Look at you. You are in love. Uh-uh, don't be silly. Okay. So, what's gonna happen if you get in and have to move to the States? -With what? -With you and Grant. First of all, Grant can wait. And secondly, I'm not gonna get in. With that audition? No, bro... You'll get in. ♪ Rap Music Playing ♪ Hm! Can you imagine? Being kidnapped and kept hostage in your own fucking office. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't I make it clear? Very fuckin' clear... that your accountant also needs to be accountable♪ -Yes, but-- -Uh-uh. Uh-uh. If this little "investigation" into your affairs digs any deeper they'll start finding gold. You'd better make sure they don't find anything. Get your books in order. Every day that passes is money out of my pocket. And every cent I lose comes out of your pocket. Clear? Now you have two-- What the fuck is this? You have two weeks to pay back the money you already pissed away through poor accounting. Nod if you understand. After two weeks I start taking family members. -Mr Philander, it's-- -Oi! I said fucking nod if you understand. There is only one thing I hate more than waiting. Can you guess what it is? Ladies. Now it's down to one week. Crack another joke. Go on. We're done talking. Come on, girls. Phyllis... Phyllis? Phyllis! Sorry, man. Mr Carelse wants to see you. I really wish there was another option, honestly. But we have to let you go. Is it because I sleep so much? It's not permanent, it's just the side-effects-- It's not you, it's the economy. Okay, so why isn't anyone else getting fired? I've been here from the start. I helped build this company. Lord, I've been here longer than you. Tell me straight. -It's because I'm sick, isn't it? -It's nothing personal, Phyllis. Of course it is. What do I do now? Something will come up. Someone will help you pack up. Leave it. I'll do it myself. I won't tell anyone. -One pick? Two picks? -Make it a Quick Pick. Adventurous, hey? Nearly there. Ah. Thank you. Thank you. Call again! Why do you want to put me out? I just wanted to finish my last beer, guys. Why do you want to put me out? Don't you come tell me, man! Watch, I'm going to... What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do to-- Now what must I do? You! You can go to hell! Get him out of here. Bring some newspaper. And bring a rag. OMG, guys, I am so pleased and so excited. They are gonna love you guys, and if they do, they will definitely invite us back next year. Hm? I'm gonna pay you guys now, because I have to dash. -Natalie? -Yes, hun? -Where's the rest of my money? -It's all there, babe. This isn't what we agreed on. Mm... well, if you think about it, it's minus 200 for transport, minus 250 for the costume, and minus 500 for my agent's fee. -But we never agreed on that. -It's in your contract. Read it. How am I supposed to live off this? You chose to become a performer. If you wanna make real money, get a real job. Like you? Yeah. Or, you could become a waitress. Break a leg. Ah...

We always used to have such great chats. Mommy, I'm not a baby anymore. I don't want to... sit and drink tea and braid hair. Okay. So, tell me, how was it? -Alright. -What happened? Why do you assume something happened? I'm not assuming anything. It's written all over your face. It's Natalie. I enjoy my job, Mommy, but she's bloody difficult. Tilly, I need you to get a job. I have a job. I sing. I know you're singing and you feel it's a real job and I'm not going to argue with you about it anymore. All I'm asking is... I need you to help with the house. -I can't feed us both anymore. -Then don't. Excuse me? Then stop making me food if you're going to keep throwing it back in my face. -Besides, who still eats soy mince?! -Crystal... The day you contribute to food in this house is the day you can make demands. -When I was your age, I-- -Yes, I know, Mommy! I know. At my age you sang. And you worked. And you had me. And you looked after Daddy. I know. You're bloody rude, you know that? And you're fucking ungrateful! Come back, I want talk to you. -I'll be in my bedroom. -Crystal! I said come back here! -I didn't want to tell you-- -Is this gonna take long? I lost my job today, Crystal. Sorry, Mommy. Now do you understand? Um... Okay, I'll do more gigs, and contact some organisers, and ask them-- Crystal, no. That's not enough. Sometimes... you must first put your dreams on hold so you can fulfil your responsibilities. -Do you understand? -What do you know about dreams? R5,70. R5.70 for a loose cigarette? Yes. You can't even round up properly. I have. Yesterday it was R5,69. Stop talking shit, Waanie. Give me one of those. R50. Look here. Firstly, are you bloody mad? R50 for a box of soup? And secondly... What the fuck must I do with soup? You asked for soup! -I was pointing at the lotto tickets. -Then say so! -I'm pointing! -You calling me a liar? Can I get a fucking lotto ticket? If you swear here one more time... you will see. What do you want? Quick Pick. Please. That's better. Is it a quick-- I'm done with that. Salute! Today my luck is in. Your luck is in the drain, yes. You... Yes, boss? Why's that fucking thing still here? Hey! Granty-boy! Hello, Boeta Ghoen. Come through. Look, first of all I want to tell you... I'm proud of you, son. It's not exactly the job your father would've wanted for you, but in his absence I want to tell you, you... You have potential. Then you're a rapper as well, hey? An emcee. -You're real good! -Thanks, Boeta Ghoen. I feel you're ready for a bit more responsibility. I think so too, Boeta Ghoen. Great. Boeta Ghoen, I'm not so sure... This product is a bit more expensive. The cash is yours to do with as you please. And the piece is... It's to ensure you can look after yourself. Yes, but that's never been necessary. I'm busy with a massive expansion drive, if I can put it like that. More territory. Also more enemies. That's just insurance. It's just... If something happens to you, I lose my product. And product is very important. See? No need to worry. Next to mine, yours looks like a little water pistol. Yeah... Yeah, take it just in case. -Are you on your way out? -Uh-huh. Did they pay you for that gig? Yes. Barely, but yes. -Tilly, you're a grown-up now. -Yes, Mommy. I need you to contribute. How do you mean, Mommy? -I'll need that money. -Mommy... Not everything, just some of it. Just enough for room and board. End of the month. Fine. There, just take it. Hey! Do you know everything I have gone through for you? Hm? Do you really think I didn't have dreams too? Do really you think I didn't have a whole life planned before you arrived? Yeah, but I didn't ask to be here, Mommy! Don't blame me for having a shitty life! I am your mother, Crystal. And you will respect me. Hi, Joan. Long time. Mm, you know, you're not getting rid of me that easily. Mm! No, I'm-- I'm alright. I'm not worried, you know me. Mm... But if you hear of anything, let me know. Listen, Joan, can I phone you back later? Yes, there's someone outside. Okay, we'll talk later. Okay, bye. Crystal, I think we must... Aweh! Have some. Is this your number? Aweh. It's quite impressive. Hey, this is my personal stash. What? I'm actually talking about the music, but okay. Oh! Yeah... Geez! You've got such a voice and you don't tell me anything? -Wow. -Uh-uh... -Who does your beats for you? -My bra from Eerste River. -Alright. -Aweh. Do you always talk about yourself this much? I mean, I get it. You're cool. -It's fine, joke all you want. -Just asking. That's how the game works, you see. -Mm? "The game"? -Mm. Alright. Sorry. Excuse my terrible womanly ignorance. Wow! Okay, okay. You're funny as fuck! Okay. But, listen, where did you get that voice? Born with it. -Yeah, you don't say. -Mm. -Can't help it. I've got it. -Ooh, you're fucking cocky! Uh-uh! -I also know something about the game. -Yeah? Mm. There are many rappers out there rapping about actual social issues out there. -Something with a message. -Aweh, aweh. I know, yes. I know. Mm, I'm just saying. Do you know Niko? Niko10long? He's my bro! -Case in point. And Jits, and that other-- -Okay, okay. Alright. Okay. Point taken. Why don't you make a track with them? Why don't you make a track with them? Why don't you make a track with me? Seriously? Okay. We can if you want. Are you alright? -Are you hungry yet? Hm? -Yes. Are the munchies getting you now? Let's go. Geez, I thought there'd be a lot of food left over. I thought maybe you're on a diet, or something. I just mean, you entertainers are always on some diet. "We entertainers"? Not that you need to diet. You look fine. I mean, you look pretty. You look fucking-- Geez, help me out here, bro! You're letting me talk such shit! Wow! Geez! You must learn when to shut up, hey. You just keep talking. You're letting me suffer. And you're still laughing! Psst, turn to me. Sorry. Sorry. Yes, boss? Okay, I'm on my way. Duty calls. Sorry. Listen, what's the plan, Speedo? This is phase one of the operation. Okay. What operation? Boeta Ghoen is expanding his territory. What does that mean, exactly? That means we're going to take someone out. Speedo, what exactly does that mean, bro? What I mean is we have to go put a bullet in someone's head. Relax. Do you have your piece? Aweh. Did I tell you to take it out?! You'd better align your chakras, boy. You're giving me anxiety too, now. Why's this kid here? The boss doesn't want one of us to fire the shot. So he'll take the fall? We just need to make sure he shoots when he must shoot. I'm going this way. Right, you're with them. Fuck... Mm, yes. I'm still looking. Okay, I might have something for you. -Really? -Yes. But you must decide for yourself. Yes, yes. Yes, of course. Someone's looking for an accountant, and in the details I got the pay looks quite alright. But... -There's always a but. -It's Boeta Ghoen. What?! No, Joan. Uh-uh. Okay, but I just had to tell you. Okay, thanks, Joan. Mommy? Let's go talk inside so she doesn't wake up. Just in case. And now? Can't a guy say hello anymore? -Just a sec. -Sorry. How was work? Very boring. Rather tell me about your evening. Alright... Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey... What kind? Are you alright? What is it? It's my mom. I just have to get away. What? Out of the house? Out of the house, out of this place. Whatever. -There's nothing left here for us. -Okay... Where do you want to go? -I don't know. -No, think quick. If you could pick any place, where would you want to go? No, man, that's stupid. Okay, tell you what. I'll count to three, then we say it together. Hey? Huh? Okay. One, two, three... -America. -America. -Really? -Aweh. To go get famous? I mean, I guess it's not all about fame and fortune. -Don't lie, I know you. -Okay, yeah. Fine. Me too. And it's nothing to be ashamed of. You must say it, and you must claim it. And you? -Must I claim it? -Aweh. What is your big dream? What is the bigger picture for you? -Hm? -The bigger picture is the stage. The world stage. Yeah. I sing the whole time, audition the whole time, but... I just want to be able to imagine a better future. Can't you see a future here? Aweh... -I've got to go. -Wait. -What's going on? -Nothing. Grant... Hey... I guess I should go before your mom wakes up. Wait here. Don't worry, she sleeps like the dead. And now for tonight's winning lotto numbers... 11... 18... 22... 36... 37... and 38! -What is it? -Want to see something crazy? Once more! 11... -Am I seeing correctly? -18... 22, 36... 37 and 38. -Fuck, Grant! -Fuck... -Wow, wow, wow! -I'm gonna buy a house and a car! You know what I'm gonna buy? A whole studio, recording equipment, computers. Bro, I'm gonna buy the whole fucking building! We should probably invest some of the money too, don't you think? Hey? But this was a fucking brilliant idea of yours, that we drive here, away from everyone. -Why do you look so worried? -No, it's my mother. Crystal, there's more than enough money, my bro. Hey? You can take care of your mother. -You know what? -Yeah? I'm gonna tell her, but only when we get the money. That'll be a nice surprise for her. Mm. A nice surprise. Aweh. Aweh! -Morning. -Morning. Um... In case I want a copy too. -You can't cash that here, okay? -Why not? -You must go to the office. -Where's the office? Well, where did you buy the ticket? At a shop. Where else would a guy buy a lotto ticket? Well, no shop can give out that kinda money, right? -Why not? -Why not? Where in this shop, do you think, would I keep 87 million? Hey? But let me quickly check. Maybe with the chocolates? -The cigarettes? The chips? -Alright, alright. -I don't even have space to hide my lunch. -Alright, there's no need for jokes. -Can you just tell us where the office is? -Oh, now I'm Google Maps as well? -Hey, do you think you're funny? -Hey, do you think you have manners? But I'll show you! -Where? -For a mil. Oh! Come on, Grant. -Have you found it yet? -Hang on. -There it is. -Where? In Bellville. -But it only opens at 9 o'clock. -No, man. Let's first go home and get some sleep. Hey? Aweh... That's me. Hello? Park here. -And now? -Sorry, I'm coming. Shit, sorry. Sorry. I have to go. Bye. And finally, some good news during a rather gloomy show... Someone has won the lotto! The R87 million jackpot. Wow. We know it's in Cape Town, we even know where the shop is. We can confirm that the ticket was bought somewhere on the Cape Flats, so, whoever you are, wherever you are, don't be like that, man! And now over to Adam for the weather. I'm going to play open cards with you. I know you prefer it that way. -Yes, please. -Mm. The tumour has grown. It's much more aggressive than we initially thought. The medication's clearly not working. The tumour is putting pressure on your brain, that's what causes the dizziness. We'll have to surgically remove it. Chemo won't help for this kind of tumour. I understand that's a lot to process now, but unfortunately we don't have much time. It's very aggressive, and I wouldn't have suggested this if I didn't think it was absolutely necessary. Take some time off, but as I said, we don't have-- Mrs Apollos? Um, ma'am? What kind with you? Indeed. What kind? -Did you know the pigs are after you? -Yeah. The block is anxious. Boeta Ghoen, please... Don't you "Boeta Ghoen" me. You weren't supposed to shoot civilians! I didn't want to. If I didn't have a gun-- I think it's best if you disappear for a bit. How am I supposed to do that? What am I? Your fucking secretary? Make a plan. Lie low. Go live somewhere else. I don't give a fuck how you do that, but we don't want to see you around. Speedo, tell him what will happen if we see him around. I'll eat his lungs. There's something wrong with you, Speedo. You hear that, boy? Speedo's gonna eat your fucking lungs. I had such high hopes for you. Let go, man! Hey, I just got home. Are you alright♪ Aweh. Sorry I left so quickly. I'm on my way. Aweh, man. I hear you have an indoor. -Do I know you? -We don't have to know each other. I give the cash, you give the ganja. Done. -No, I've got fuck all. -Don't be like that! Just a gram. -Salute, bro. -Wait. Hey, hey! Where are you going? Take off the bag. Hands in the air. Stand still. Hey! Take your bag. Come to the van. Have you chosen a family member♪ I'm not a fucking animal, but I am taking a family member. -At least you get to choose which one. -It won't come to that. I hope so. But your time is running out. Mr Philander, a few days from now, my books will be so clean you can eat off it. Something's come up. I-- Hello? Hello?! -What? -Grant. They have him. Who are "they", Speedo? Use complete sentences. The pigs. I'll give you money, send someone to get him out. Don't go there yourself, we don't know who he told what. Speedo? Don't hurt him... Yet. Mommy? Kill it. We first need to talk. Aweh, this is Grant. Leave a message. Get up. Boeta Ghoen, I can explain. You are jeopardising my entire operation. Can you please explain. Hm? You owe me money, boy. What's your plan? I don't have a plan, but I'll make one, Boeta Ghoen. -The product in your bag? -Mm-mm, they took it. Empty out his pockets. Unlock your phone, I want to see who you've been talking to. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on here? Why are you so taken with that bit of paper? Did you win a little something? No, Boeta Ghoen, please man. Goodness, Speedo! Our boy here has won the lotto! Please, that ticket's going to change my entire life. It's all I have. It's 250k. 250k?! Do you really think 250k will change your whole life? Huh? Boeta Ghoen, please... Mind you, R250 000 is about enough to cover the product you lost. -What do you think? -Boeta Ghoen, please... No, no, no, really. It covers all that indoor and crystal. The cash. Hey? Boet Ghoen, please... Okay... Everything has consequences, my boy. Take that to the shops and take this piece of shit out of here. I have a meeting with the new accountant. -Are you bleeding on my granny's carpet? -Sorry, sorry... Ah... Welcome. Aweh, are you at home? Hey, please let me know when you're home. We have to talk. What's going on? Something happened. Boeta Ghoen took the ticket. What were you doing with Boeta Ghoen? It was stupid of me, I never should've-- Why did you even have that ticket? I don't know. I-- We left the shop. I was tired, I forgot. Geez... This whole time I thought, "Look how lucky we are." But now look! Crystal, I'll work something out. Just look at the state of you! What do you want to work out, Grant? Sorry, I should've stayed with you guys. I don't know why I went to the club. Yeah, exactly. What were you doing there alone anyway? Shit, we must go. -Where? -The funeral. -Crystal, I don't know those people. -Please. I can't go. We still have my dad's clothes. Maybe something will fit. Fuck, fuck, fuck! Ah, my brother. Look what we have here. Wow! But this is a life-changing thing here in your hand. You know I can't give it to you. It's too much. So, are you gonna share? See, this reminds me of the time me and my little brother went to Genadendal to try to steal a cow. For the milk, you see. But when my brother and I got back to Cape Town we realised I don't have pasture for the cow. So it was up to my little brother to ensure the cow can eat. So he took the cow with him. There's a park just opposite his house. But when it came to milking it, do you think he shared? Don't be like my little brother, brother. -Boeta G? -Speedo? We have a problem. That's why I have you, Speedo. Sort it out. It's tricky. -Why? -The pigs are on your case. Granty-boy's little accident? -Do we know who? -Policeman. Van Niekerk. Good. Fix it. -Preferred method? -Use your imagination. Sorry. I'm going to make tea. Would you like some? Please, Mommy. Tilly, I have to tell you something. I have cancer. A brain tumour. That's why I got so dizzy. That's why you started taking all those pills. The doctor says the pills have stopped working. It's grown. He needs to cut it out. Thank you, Mommy. Thanks for telling me. Okay, okay... -I also have something to say. -Mm? You won the lotto, Mommy. But we lost the ticket. How do you mean I won the lotto? We took it. You were asleep so we swapped the tickets. Who's "we"? Grant and I. Tell me you're joking. -So you stole the ticket? -Mommy... Sorry, Mommy. Sorry. How much was it? -The jackpot. -What?! -It's the jackpot, Mommy. -Geez, Tilly! Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Mommy. -Where's the ticket now? -It's gone. Don't lie to me, Crystal. Boeta Ghoen took the ticket from Grant, Mommy. Did I tell you I found a job? -What does that-- -Working for Boeta Ghoen. Are you being serious, Mommy? Yes. Will Boeta Ghoen still have the ticket? Yes. The shops can't cash it in, and the lotto office only opens again on Monday. I'm going to fetch my ticket. -They won't. -Won't what? Take the ticket. -Did they say why not? -Too much money. This R250 000 is becoming more trouble than it's worth. Tell you what. Let's leave it and sort it out later. We have bigger fish to fry. -Are you making progress? -Yes, the troops are ready. Ah! First day in the trenches. -Are you ready? -I believe so. This-- Sorry, this is my right-hand man, Speedo. This is Phyllis. Pleased to meet you. Phyllis is going to help us out of our financial predicament. Well, I'll try. I can't promise anything. No, no, no, I heard you're great with creative accounting. Hm? I'm not a crook. Mm-mm! Neither are we. We just need your help to prove it. We're closed for a day or two, so it's the perfect time to get to know the system. -Come, have a seat. -I'm out. Yeah. Uh, Speedo? Speedo! I was almost rich. You ready? I think so, yes. Crystal, I know it sounds bad, but it's not that bad. But you were a dealer? -Yes. -For Boeta Ghoen? Aweh. -What? -Ganja. Just ganja? Grant! The dream remains the same. Music is still my focus. You're a criminal, Grant. Did you try to steal that ticket from me? Whoa, whoa, whoa! We both tried to steal that ticket, Crystal. I was going to tell my mother about it. No, no, no, I did tell her about it. But you tried to steal the ticket from me! -No, I just wasn't thinking. -Or you were only thinking about yourself. So what else have you been lying about? Hm? Okay... so, everything? Right. Crystal, wait... See, I think the best gift you can give the world is the utilisation of your own talents. -Mm... Been saying that myself all along. -Mm. I see a bright future for you here. What do you see? Do you also see a future for yourself here? Yeah. A great future. And that? It's what I'll use to get through the door to take back what's mine. Okay... -So, are we going tonight? -You're not going. But it's all my fault. Yes. Because you're young and stupid. Stupid enough to break in. Fine. -So, when are we going? -Now. -I just need to put on something else. -What?! The club is closed. Go get ready, we have work to do. -Do I need to say it out loud, Speedo? -No, Boeta Ghoen. Don't stuff up. Grant isn't here, so we won't, Boeta Ghoen. Taking out cops isn't a joke. You can snuff Granty-boy as well. -How do you mean, Boeta Ghoen? -I mean get rid of him. Get rid of him? Yes. And I don't mean put him on a bus to Worcester. Rip his heart out of his chest. Can you do that? I'll do that with pleasure. Good. The kid doesn't know he's become a fucking liability. Your guy in front of Van Niekerk's house, what's the signal? He pops a wheelie. Right. And remember who you're dealing with. Don't be a cowboy. In and out. Start searching. -I don't know, it must be here. I saw it. -Maybe he has it. Where are the keys? -Why would he put his safe keys on there? -Who knows? I have to make a few phone calls. Keep your phone open. -This is stupid, Mommy. -Crystal, just look again. -I've already looked there, Mommy. -I'm just going to double-check. And now? Kind of you to visit. No, no, no, don't move around too much. The triggers on these things are so sensitive nowadays. We wouldn't want anything to happen and then I accidentally shoot one of you in the face. I hope you guys can hear me. What? Is he expecting us to answer him? I don't know. He doesn't even have an earpiece. His first rodeo. What have we here? -And now? -Welcome. One thing about you, boy, is that you are always on time. You come as if you have been sent. Tea? Coffee? This is turning into a party. I should be charging entrance fee. Whoa, whoa, whoa... Yes? Right, that's it. Let's move. This is the target. No one else. Alright? Yeah? You fucking arse! -See anything? -Alright. Your side? Hello. Whoa! Easy, girl. Did you invite the whole world? Huh? If you want to shoot him, at least give me warning to put down some plastic. Why? Because it's messy, and this is my granny's kilim. Not you, him! Why did you do it? Did you really think I wouldn't find out? Huh? -Aneeqa, please. I can explain. -Some people talk! Not to the police, but they talk to each other! What did you do? Did you try and talk your way out, huh? Okay, I can't sit and watch this fucking movie all day. A real tear jerker, but unfortunately I must ask you to put down the gun, girl. Aneeqa, what's going on? Aneeqa, just-- I can explain. Please... Grant... Grant killed my mom. Please, I can explain. Hello, Speedo? I hope I'm not interrupting, but won't you come over? Thank you. No, no, no, nothing serious. Just a few... loose ends. We're at the target, but something doesn't look right. Boss wants us, looks like an emergency. People with money... Aneeqa, please, please, please... Your timing is dramatic. Hey, hey, hey... I'm unarmed. See? Put down that weapon, girl. Mm-mm. An eye for an eye. -Aneeqa... -Stop... -Aneeqa, listen to me. -Stop! This is not what your mother would've wanted for you. You've got your whole life ahead of you. -Put down the gun. -No. Come on. Where are you? Help. Come in, where are you? I think I just threw up a little in my own mouth. Get rid of them. Boeta Ghoen, there was one more thing I wanted to tell you. What? Come out with your hands in the air! Never mind. Police! Hands in the air! Come out! Hands up! I don't know what you think you have on me, but it's absolutely nothing. Okay? I'm telling you now, my lawyer will take you down. You're mistaken if you think I'm gonna sit. I'm coming for you! I'm coming for you! I really didn't want to come. Yeah. I won't lie... -I thought we were pretty great together. -Hey... You were the best thing that ever happened to me. You know that? Do you still sing? Yep, but I don't perform as much anymore. And you? No, I never sang. Yeah, right. There's a bra inside who sometimes makes beats with me. Seriously? Aweh. With spoons, boxes, glasses. Things like that. I'm only joking. He has access to a computer so, aweh. How can you still joke? I mean, after everything that happened? The day I stop making jokes is the day I die in here. What's that? It's a cassette player. Is this your music? Aweh. There's a whole album on there. Grant! No... we can't. We can't. Sorry. It's alright. Take good care of yourself, hey. And, best behaviour, please. Of course. Best behaviour is my ticket out of here. Can I come visit you when I get out of here one day? Depends. -On what? -Will you come to America? What do you mean? -Remember that audition I did? -Aweh. I got in. -Don't-- Are you being serious? -Yes. Salute! I'll fucking swim if I must. -I will. -Yeah.
