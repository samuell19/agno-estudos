The very first time was when I was taking my children to Ventimiglia station. Unusually, the front of the station was teeming with crowds, with hordes of people who looked like they had just arrived after a long journey. There were men, but also many women and children. I couldn't really figure out what was happening. All I know is that I had a strange feeling, because they were just sitting there on the ground, without... To me, it was as if they were waiting for something, but they didn't know what. I'm having a cigarette with friends, at a restaurant for someone's birthday. And along comes a migrant, I can see that right away. He's slight, gaunt, and he wants to go to Paris. I'm not sure what to do, so I call my son, I tell him: "Bring some warm clothes, bring something to eat." And there's one thing that haunts me, it's this look, as if he's saying "Help, help", and me feeling totally powerless, with no idea what to do. I went back to my meal, but I wasn't really there. It was going round and round in my head The worst thing was when I went back to my warm home, I thought, oh my, it's cold outside and he's sleeping outside. How is he? What will happen, will he be caught by the police? I felt bad because I hadn't been brave enough to say to him, come home with me. What are they doing here? They shouldn't be here. We can't help everyone. - They don't intend to stay here. - I know. What they want is to get through, get across. - They should let them through. - They won't let them. - France has closed its borders. - Why? Because they don't want migrants in France. They don't want them, so they close the borders. But they get across all the same, because they really want to get across. I understand that, they're unfortunate, for sure. But what can we do? It's hard to understand. They're foreigners who've come from foreign countries. They come from far away. So... It's like... We don't know where they come from and where they're going. They're like the wind. Where does it come from, where does it go? TO THE FOUR WINDS My mother comes from Vernante. They emigrated from Vernante. One day, the police came looking for her. They locked her up because she'd crossed the border without any papers. She spent 34 days in jail. For not having any papers. So, that was in the 1920s? But your mother was Italian? Yes. And it's happening again, now. More shady business... BREIL-SUR-ROYA SEPTEMBER 2016 It all started just over a year ago, roughly. I saw some refugees on the road, so I asked them if they wanted something to eat... Some had lost their way, because they leave Ventimiglia on foot, following the railroad. That's at night, and they end up in the middle of the Roya Valley with no idea where they are. I told them where Breil station was. At the time it was quite easy to get to Nice via Breil. I either told them or took them to the station myself. Then, later, I started seeing families by the roadside, late at night, and I brought them back to my house. Since something had to be done, I smuggled them across. Not much. I didn't expect to be feeding so many people this summer. You hear people say, "France can't take in all the world's poor." With what I earn as a small farmer, my four hens and 100 or so olive trees, I manage to host eight people, with help from associations, it's true, but there are solutions. I live here on my own. Financially, I work for myself, but I manage to help eight people. I think that France could easily help one million people. - You've helped more than eight. - Yes, I have, sure. - Eight at the moment? - For now, yes. Eight every day. Several hundred altogether, yes. Several hundred. I'm quite open about it. If that means going to jail, I'll go to jail, but... But I won't stop what I'm doing just because I'm putting myself at risk. I think that... It's my affair, I don't judge people who don't do what I'm doing. Then, I don't have any kids... I don't have a family... If I have to take a risk in order to stay free... Being free doesn't necessarily mean being free to move about. It's in here, freedom, for me. And I want to stay free. I hope I'm not mistaken, but I trust the law to put things in perspective when I'm arrested, as I'm bound to be. It's inevitable. And... I do trust the law. How old are you? 17 years old. Where do you want to go, to travel? Germany. Do you have any family in Germany? Yes, my uncle. In fact, the solution adopted by the authorities is to shift the problem in terms of time. Like when they catch people who are of age... Minors caught in the Alpes-Maritimes, over the border, are returned to Ventimiglia. Those who are of age are sent to Taranto, in southern Italy. They send them to southern Italy, to gain three days. Three days... How much does it cost to send them to southern Italy, just to gain three days to deal with the problem? That's their solution: gain time. I don't understand this solution, because... In Ventimiglia too, they can't cope with thousands of people arriving. They can't manage that, it's not possible. What use is Europe, if trucks can move freely on its highways with cellphones made by kids in lousy conditions? Here, we have people who have left to escape lousy conditions due to a global economic and political problem. We see the consequences, but we want to cherry-pick, have the cellphones, cheap jewelry and stuff, whenever we want, but these people, we don't want them. It's shocking, no? The Roya Valley is divided between two countries: Italy to the south, at Ventimiglia on the Roya River, and France to the north. If you follow this route northwards, you find yourself in Italy again. This valley is a sort of small French bubble in Italian territory. People used to cross the border several times a day without being aware of it. In the spring of 2015, France shifted the border into the Bevera Valley, to Sospel, establishing permanent checkpoints there. This zone is now neither French nor Italian. It's very hard for the refugees to fathom the trap they've fallen into. They're in France, and at the same time not in France. We found her at 1.30 a.m. on the road. Between... On the French side, 2 km further down. Yeah. With a 14-year-old girl, the mother, another woman and two guys. Do you see where it's leading? I don't know how many times they crossed with this kid. There are mothers with their kids, who try 10 times, 15, 20 times to cross the border and are sent back to Ventimiglia. Where will it lead? Because, you see, this girl has a legal right to remain in France, her mother too. If they're allowed to apply for asylum. The crazy thing is, they're stopping people from claiming asylum. She has the right to be here, this one. Where will it lead? She's going to stay in Europe, for sure. It'll take a long time, but she'll... But what will be the result in 20 years' time? What will it lead to, the way these children are dealt with? What do you make of it? She's got a broken nail. How did you do that? Does it hurt? Did you hurt yourself? THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER 16-17TH 2016 35 EXILES HAVE COME TO CEDRIC'S PROPERTY. IT'S COLD AND THE CAMP IS FULL. CEDRIC ENDS UP SHELTERING MORE THAN 60 PEOPLE. This morning, since last night, in fact, we've been trying to contact official bodies to inform them about what's happening. I told him that before we agree to any request by any of these organizations, this meeting would be held to decide whether to seek help from national organizations in Paris, with what's happening here. It's not a squat for artists we're opening here. It's a squat where there are people in very bad shape, where there are minors. And minors have a legal right to safe shelter. If we send them to the local police or the council, they're not safe. Nor at the Alpes-Maritimes prefecture. - Here, Paris. - Paris, OK. And we are here. - Here's where we are. - Here. - Here, Italy. - Italy. And this the center. 1,000 km, Paris. Paris. Nearly 1,000 km, 800 km. Train? - The train? - By train, how... How many hours? By train, er... By the express train, how long? Six hours. - Six hours. - Six hours from Nice? From Nice to Paris? And the bus? How many hours by bus? - 12 hours. - 15 hours, I think. From Marseille to Paris: 12 hours. I didn't turn it on. The hose keeps getting twisted... When it's ready, we'll turn it on. - Will you stay here? - Yes. [Tell him not to wring the hose.] [Tell him not to wring the hose.] Water. Has someone complained? We're responding to the internet broadcast of your arrival here. We've just come to take some numbers, take stock. It'll be good if we can stay. But how do we go about... We can't talk to the Prefect. He takes the decisions, but we can't tell him what we think. Talk to his Chief-of-Staff. We could ask the Chief-of-Staff to come here so we can talk. The police from Breil-sur-Roya and Tende came here. We'd like to explain the situation in Roya to the Alpes-Maritimes Prefect before he orders the police to round everyone up. And make him aware that there are minors. You should call back at 2 p.m. - Right now, there's no one here. - OK. At 2 p.m., I'll try to put you through to the Chief-of-Staff. OK. Thank you. We'll set out the situation. Some bailiffs came with a manager from the SNCF. They noted we'd entered some of the buildings and cleaned them. The police wanted to know what we intended to do. There are several solutions. It's up to you to decide what you want to do. I think we should ask them... It's up to you to decide, it's not up to us. France has a legal obligation to protect minors and to keep them in France, in reception centers, etc... So we could ask them to look after the minors and to allow the adults to claim asylum at the Alpes-Maritimes prefecture. I think, given the situation we're in, that we should ask to stay here as long as possible, bring those people out and offer them our solutions, the ones that we've already put in place. We try to steer them towards a positive initiative, where there's a chance of success. If we dump them in those people's hands, they've got no chance. So that's what I want to talk about. The prefecture won't give us anything. We can still state our demands highlighting the political dimension. No way will they help us, forget about that. There's no point in saying, "We want water, bunches of flowers." What we say is, "We want premises and we'll stay until we get some." "The RSC Collective," the Roya Solidarity Collective, "notes again the lack of a reception center in the Roya Valley." "the lack of a reception center in the Roya Valley for adults and minors, "apart from the premises under occupation; "and wishes to make the following proposal: "that the premises should remain occupied unless "more hospitable facilities in the Roya Valley are made available. "We have concrete proposals." So, we're staying. Thank you. It will happen again, even if it's over now. In four days, whether we manage to lodge them with friends who've joined us or whether they're taken away, four days from now the same thing will happen again. We're ready to bring some nurses along. Anyway, we have to maintain the measures in place. - For medical care and so on. - Of course, we'll come. We'll try to come wherever it happens to be. We'll make arrangements to come. I'll round up some medicine tomorrow. - You can have some for free? - Yes, of course. I'll take them to Bernard and Isabelle, to the nurses, etc. They'll have plenty of them. He had an appointment for surgery. What are those bits of metal? Bullets? We're not sure what they are. What kind of metal? What is it? - Someone is shooting a gun. - Sorry? - Someone is shooting at him with a gun. - A gun? - A gun. - Shooting with a gun? - Yes You see, it must be metal from the gun. It's bullets. We cannot do anything now. It's not possible to... He has to go to hospital, but now it's not possible. We've said we'll get them out and get them back. They've thought hard about the future. They want to occupy the place with me. They know they're going to be caught. That's why we're moving the adults. The problem is that we had to get an idea of who's in shape and who can't do a 2-hour walk. Because if it goes wrong, it means a 2-hour walk. Those who can't manage that, take them and leave them at someone's in the valley. Sort them out after. Take care of them for 8 days, without any pressure. We'll take care of that after we've left. THE EVICTION IS IMMINENT, A DECISION HAS TO BE TAKEN REGARDING THE ADULTS. IF ARRESTED, THEY WILL BE SENT BACK TO SOUTHERN ITALY. THEY DECIDE TO RISK LEAVING BY NIGHT UNDER THE NOSE OF THE 100 POLICE OFFICERS SURROUNDING THE SQUAT. 43 ADULTS ARE TAKEN TO OTHER LOCATIONS IN FRANCE. If you're arrested, say that you're part of the collective. I'd like to know these people's surnames. The problem is that he doesn't know the way either... I know the way by heart, I go to Gap twice a week. Are these ones moving? I don't know who's moving. We haven't said. - You don't know yet? - We don't know who's going by car. I need to know. The problem is reaching Ubaye Valley, the lower part. After, there's only one road that goes to Gap. Do I do 300 km all the way to Gap and back? Do you think there'll be any police on the road to Gap? - No, there are only small villages. - From Gap on, it's easy. Once you've left Italy, it's fine. At the bottom of the Arche Pass, the road forks, with a branch that climbs the Vars Pass into the Ubaye Valley and Barcelonnette. If there's no one at that crossroads, it's fine after. There are two guys that come? I'll tell them and check. We need to do a headcount. We're going to form a line to leave. Don't make any noise, I'll count you. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down, sit down. There are too many. How many are there? There are nine of you in total. OK, beat it, get moving. He says it's obvious they're gearing up for something. So, that's... Alain's idea is to say... To call people. Now would be the time to call... To call the journalists, but they won't let the journalists through. I sent you a message on Facebook saying we're waiting for the police. It will continue. A week from now, we come back here, we go somewhere else... There'll be no end to it. You've got other things to do, so do we. The difference is, you get paid, we don't. It's costing us money. So, what do I do the day after tomorrow with 50 guys at my property? You tell me. Listen, there are checkpoints at the border, at the authorized crossing points. When those border controls are conducted, whether the people are adults or minors, they are handed back to the Italian authorities, if they don't have the appropriate documentation. - You're not answering my question. - Yes, I am. If it's somewhere else in France, clearly, if there are any unaccompanied foreign minors, they'll be taken in by the Departmental Council to establish, under the authority of the Public Prosecutor, whether they're really unaccompanied minors. Let me remind you that last year, 1,500 unaccompanied foreign minors were taken in by theDepartment, and another 67 so far this year. So, once again, there's what happens at the border, at the clearly indicated authorized crossing points, which are also documented, and what happens elsewhere in France. Let me stress, once again, that elsewhere in France, - unaccompanied foreign minors... - That's not true. I'm on the ground, I take people across. You know that, we pick up minors and send them to Nice. I'm delighted to hear, Sir, in the presence of the Public Prosecutor, - that you take them across. - I don't hide it. There were some kids we took to Cannes, I can show you photos of these kids, and twice they were sent back to Italy. Two times. So at a certain point... We don't obey the law, I agree, but neither do you. And the day when you obey the law, so will we. We don't obey the law because you don't obey the law. The problem is that we have minors who are in danger here. Clearly, what we do isn't ideal. We'd buy a legally compliant building if we had the money. We don't have the money. You leave us no choice but to resort to this kind of action. What we'd like is to have access to premises, so that for at least one night we can... What do we do with minors who arrive at 3 a.m.? Go to the police with 50 people? We can't do that. Three months from now, the temperature will be below zero. It can't be done, or so you say, but if you come across minors in danger, the solution isn't to shelter them at your property, but to report them... I don't shelter them, they come to my home. - Oh, really. - Yes... When unaccompanied minors arrive on anybody's property in France, the Departmental Councils, the child protection services are responsible, not private citizens. Say that to the camera, please. We can't leave minors with just anyone, definitely not. That's not possible, as you know, children... I mean, with all the horror stories. What do I do when a kid tells me he was sent back to the border... Easy, call the police. Who send kids to the Border Police, who send them to Ventimiglia. That's what really happens... I didn't close the borders, the State did. People subjected to checks when they are entering France at the control points the Chief-of-Staff mentioned are not deemed to have entered France, so different rules apply. I've no reason not to trust the Italian authorities to look after them. In any case, that's not the situation here. The situation here is different, as you know. They're in France, and unaccompanied children in France can't be left to fend for themselves. They can't just be released, the way you do, outside... - We don't release them outside. - In Draguignan... That can't be tolerated. Really, I think you need... You need to understand that this is about protecting minors... Yes, but on the ground that doesn't happen. I'm sorry, but that's not what happens. So... In future, what do we do? What I want to know is: they arrive at my house, what do we do? - Do they turn up alone at your home? - They come alone. - How do they get there? - On foot, along the railway tracks. Through the tunnels, truck drivers... I've been making a film about this situation for seven months. I've followed the migrants through the tunnels. They arrive... I've seen children, minors, at his house who have slept in the rain, in the mud. I think that's what motivated them to come here. They had nowhere else to go. There's no getting away from the reality of it. - Tell me what to do. - At any rate, they cross over. And if they're sent back to Italy, they come back here. One was sent back to Sicily, 4 days later he was back in Ventimiglia. For the 12th time, he was trying to cross the border. The movement's never-ending, they keep coming back. We'll never be able to stop them. That's the inescapable reality. We're going to talk things over, calmly, over there. Thank you. - We'll leave you to talk it over. - We'll come back here. - Will you be coming back? - Yes, OK. I was under arrest for 48 hours and then spent another day in police custody. So, now I'm on probation, which means I'm not allowed to help anyone who's here illegally. But the big problem is that they turn up on their own and I'm... So there are people at my home who I'm not allowed to shelter, feed or advise, and who I can't look after. That's where we are. If we could do a voice test, that would be great. Can you talk as if you were talking live? Yes, Cédric Herrou, farmer, Breil-sur-Roya, offender. - Can I unplug the line? - Cédric Herrou, can you hear me? Yes, good evening, Atika. Good evening, Mr Valls. We have an area where the law doesn't apply, called south-eastern France. Unaccompanied minors, children, that is without their parents, who have left their country, who should be looked after by the State They should be looked after by the State, but we have to take them to another department in secret, because the Alpes-Maritimes department makes the reception of those minors very problematic. I've had to take my own vehicle and evade police checkpoints so that these children can have access to their rights. Not just children, families too... Your borders are harmful. And.. You talk about combating terrorism, but the way to combat terrorism is through understanding, not through stigmatization. You stigmatize a people, you stigmatize religions, you stigmatize individuals. The people I come face to face with are statistics for you, for me, they are individual stories. Each one of the people at my home, there are 15 people at my home who I'm hiding and who I'll smuggle across the border because these people have rights, they're on French soil. And the Roya Valley is an area where the law doesn't apply, where minors are deprived of their rights, - or families... - Do you want to reply Mr Valls, on this question of unaccompanied minors? Cédric Herrou is saying that, in the Alpes-Maritimes, unaccompanied minors are sent back across the border and that this is illegal. Of course, it's an obligation. When the jungle was dismantled, unaccompanied minors were taken in by the State... Stop talking about the jungle. - Let Mr Valls reply. - I'm replying to Karim Rissouli. I'm not talking about the jungle, Mr Valls. You have easy access to the media... You have easy access to the media, I don't, so... Fine. Say what you want to say. Good evening, but a little short. - Isa, are you a local girl? - Yes. I grew up here. I've always lived here. I went away for a while, then came back. What do you do? I'm a private nurse. When I'm not working, I'm a nurse for Médecins du monde. As a volunteer. How did you get into this? How did you go from private nursing to giving your time for Médecins du monde and for what's happening in the valley? I started giving my time for the refugees because I was coming across a lot them on the road and I didn't know how to help them. So, I got in touch with the movement that was at... I don't know if we can talk about it, that began in Lucioles. Yes, because you were part of it. That led to a team of voluntary nurses for the Roya Valley, together with doctors. We have regular rounds. We visit the homes of people who are hosting refugees. In the work you do as a private nurse, does it cause any problems with your clients? - I don't talk about it. - Do they know? I think they do know, but it's not official. I've never stated it clearly, because sometimes, people say things that aren't very pleasant. And I don't want, I don't wish to mix up my professional life, my professional life strictly speaking, with what I do away from work. I don't want to get involved in conflicts, to hear things I don't want to hear. Do you understand? Nurse? For pain, sickness, scratches? Any problems? No? Health problems? I'm going up there to see the others. I speak a mixture of English and Arabic. - Are you OK? - I'm OK. - Do you speak French? - No. - You speak English? - Yes. - I'm a nurse, Isabelle. - Hamis Abdallah. Hamis, do you have any problems? - No. - Pain, sickness? - You're OK? - Yes. And you? You OK? I'm great. OK, no one has any problems. Before I had leg and knee problems, but you gave me medicine. - Pain? - Yes, here. It's... Ah, the knee. It's... It's better with the medicine? Yes, the medicine you gave me yesterday is good, but no... When you walk? Yes, I have problems when I walk. Yes, here. Let's have a look, downstairs. You see, it's very swollen. - More pain? - Yes, a little. - Do you have cream? - Yes. - Which medicine? - Paracetamol. Yes, I have. What is paracetamol? - He doesn't know what paracetamol is. - He told me he did. - What is it, paracetamol? - A medicine for pain. I know, you gave me some before. You gave me some to take twice a day. - Here is the medicine. - Yes, it's the same. - This one, 3 times a day. - Three times a day? - Morning, middle, afternoon. - Evening. You're scared, aren't you? Of being seen in your underpants. - Did he fall on the railway track? - That's what I understood. Apparently both his knees got twisted on the railway track. No, look at me normally. Normally, OK? Do you have any pain here? Here? Pain? Pain? Pain? No pain? No pain? Here? It's OK. This is breath? - Breathing is OK. - OK? The problem is mucus. - You understand, mucus? - Yes. When you sleep, it goes here, and after... One liter milk. He drinks one liter of milk? Drink water. - Water? - Not milk, water. More water. JANUARY 4TH 2017 I didn't get enough sleep, it's a pity, but I'm pleased to be going there. I'm pleased to be going there, in the hope of shaking things up. I hope it won't be a flash in the pan that fizzles out afterwards. - Hassan, do you think Cédric will win? - Yes. Inch'Allah. After what he's done for us. - Inch'Allah. - It worries me when you say Inch'Allah Yeah. Solidarity with the refugees! So-so-so solidarity! CEDRIC HAS BEEN ACCUSED BY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR "OF ASSISTING THE ILLEGAL ENTRY, MOVEMENT AND RESIDENCE OF FOREIGNERS IN FRANCE." AND BY THE SNCF OF "TRESPASSING ON A THIRD PARTY'S PREMISES". - Well, that wasn't bad. - Not too bad. Still, I had hoped for a complete acquittal. - How much? I don't know. - 3,000, suspended. - Acquitted. - On the SNCF charges, too? - Yes. - The SNCF's case was dismissed. - Well, that's really cool. - Yes, great. And our police force is under the orders of the Prefect, Mr Leclerc, who has repeatedly ordered the police to apprehend kids who are in the Alpes-Maritimes and take them, illegally, back to the Italian border. And I'd like to say to the Prefect, and to Mr Ciotti: watch out. We're here, there are many of us and we have lawyers on our side. I'm a farmer, I may earn next to nothing, but politics is conducted on the ground and we are strong because that's what democracy is: the power of the people. We're going to take back the power. And the law is on our side. My client is a responsible person. Responsible: to answer for one's acts. He does answer for his acts. He never denied doing what he did. People should stop labeling him. He isn't an ideologue, he's not part of "No Borders". He's a practical man, he's a farmer. He has his hens, he has his olive trees. He cultivates his garden. And when people turn up at his garden, he tries to find solutions. And when he was cautioned in August, and told he should get a minivan to improve their conditions, that's what he did. So what is he being criticized for? For obeying the law? Thus, it will be an important point in the judge's interpretation of this law concerning illegal entry and residence. It has wider implications, we hope. What do they intend to do in the whole of this valley? Say, we'll take no more people, close the door, shoot them? What should we do? They don't know. Where are you? No. What? Ventimiglia? - No, no. - In Nice, in France? Do you speak Tigrinya? Do you speak Trigrinya? Those girls are totally crazy. But that's what I like, this craziness. They're kind of touched, but it's the pantail Nissart, in fact. It's the Eritreans injecting some Nice pantail into Nice. Local culture in Nice is supposed to be all about pantail. - Tell me what pantail means. - Pantail? Pantail is... I know what it is, but explain it for the camera. It's what we're doing now. It's art, as a matter of fact. Art in real life. It's art that isn't obvious. It's not painting, it's not clowning, it's not... It's the art of living, everyday art. You see, appearing on TV is pantail. On one hand, you couldn't care less, on the other... There is an art to it. But loads of people appear on TV, that's not art for me. No, it's hammy. Yes, it's hammy, and hogwash, yes. That doesn't quite pin it down. Yeah, there's an art to it... That's what's good about it, it's people who have a rough crossing, but there's a funny side when they come a cropper. I've seen kids laugh about other kids who didn't make it, got themselves arrested. Laughing about it saves the day. Laughter and derision are treasures. We can tear everything down with them. Pantail... It's here now. It's hard to nail. So, were there many journalists this morning? - If there were a lot of people? - Yes. - Right, Michel. - Yes? This is the first time I've filmed you. I'll get behind the camera. First, let's set the scene: it's 2 o'clock in the morning, we've all had a skinful. My court case is over, we've been celebrating that. Now we're sitting around, talking. Shooting this film makes me feel really alive. Cédric must feel really alive doing what he does. And, really, thanks to or because of what is happening. What's the best thing about it, Cédric, for you? Me, I'm an anarchist. No, spare us all the stuff in the old pamphlets. It's kind of true. It's the fact that... Now, in broad daylight, we can see the politics we've had to put up with for ages. I think the State is racist. Politicians are dropping any pretences. They couldn't care less about Blacks, and now they're quite blatant about it. We're seeing what the Blacks bring out in them. It's a sort of mirror, in fact. I look at the Blacks and I see a mirror. All inhibitions have been swept away. It shows what they really think about us and the people coming here. That's why I respect them. I really do, and it helps me, because... Because the whole issue is a fucking mirror. We'll be in the same boat not long from now. I want to put up a fight, and I am fighting for them, but it's me I'm fighting for first. For us. This isn't my job, another solution will have to be found eventually. The solution is for you to stop. There are not many people waiting to step in. Certainly not the prefecture. I forgot I had some strawberries to plant. Did you buy more hens because you didn't have time for the olives? That's right, there was no time for the olives and it has to make economic sense, so there are more... More hens than expected. You have to adjust, in economic terms. Parler. Parler. Parler: speak. Parler français. - Parler français. - Français? Français: French. France: country. That's France. France, country. Country, France. Je parle français. Fatigué? Are you tired? Fatigué. Fatigué. - Yawning? - Yawning? Je mange bien. Je mange bien. Je dors bien. Je dors bien. - Comment ça va? - Comment ça va? - Ca va pas. - Ca va pas. - Je suis fatigué. - Je suis fatigué. Je suis malade. Je suis malade. Malade, do you understand? Comment ça va? Comment ça va? Moi, ça va. Moi, ça va. Mon ami, ça va pas. Mon ami, ça va pas. Il est fatigué. Il est fatigué. Yeah. I couldn't sleep because if I think about my family and I am alone, the way I miss them, and the way they miss me too. When I was alone, when I went to bed, I used to think about them. I cannot sleep well. Yeah. This is how it is. And now you said, when you came here, you sleep better? I sleep better now because before I didn't even have a phone to call them. And now you can call them? Yes, now I have contact with them. We can keep in touch. The reason why we left Nigeria is because of this Boko Haram. One of my brothers was caught and he disappeared. Until now. Until now we don't know whether he is dead or alive. It is why we emigrated to Chad. You were born in Nigeria? Yes, I was born in Nigeria. Whenever I think about my brother, I cannot control myself. That's my story. Why we emigrated from Nigeria to Chad. Then, in Chad, we didn't have a better life and now I am here. I'm coming back today. I'm coming back... I'm going to Nice and I'm coming back. One of the girls is sick. We contacted the police in Menton to let them know in advance that we were returning with families seeking asylum in France. We had an appointment at the police station. What they did was to take this family back to Italy. In the process, they falsified their statement, stating they'd just arrived at Breil station on foot, and were seeking asylum in Italy. They couldn't see their lawyers, the law was blatantly flouted. The case was heard by Nice Administrative Court, which found against the prefecture. There's a good sentence here. I like this: "The Prefect of Alpes-Maritimes was manifestly in breach of asylum law." The funny thing is, we're being criminalized, but my case isn't over yet, there's an appeal, and he was sentenced before me, so... So, as it stands, he's an offender and I'm not. The game's not over. We said we'd keep calm. We said we'd keep calm. Ladies and gentlemen, could I see some ID? There's an Administrative Court order. And it concerns you. - What's your name, Sir? - Cédric Herrou. We'd like you to come with us, please. I will, but not them. Them too, since they have no ID. Not them. I'll call Madame Momie, if you like. - Let's see. - Yes, of course. You're supposed to report today, Cédric. - Is it Thursday? - No, it's Monday. - I report on Thursdays, Michel. - Shit. OK, thank you. Bye. If they have no ID, they have to come with me. - No, they're not going with you. - They have to. - No. - Will you get out, please. - Wait. - We'll call the prefecture. - We'll call the prefecture. - I'll call... - Who are you calling? - My superiors. - Who are they? - My superiors. Tell me their names to avoid wasting time. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Lieutenant Barbereau. So they are... A family, is that right? - That's right. - OK. - Are these the right names? - That's right, yes. OK, I'll make a phone call and come back to you. OK, good. Thank you. Yeah, it stinks. They want to take us to the Border Police at Menton. What a pain in the ass. They've stopped the train. BORDER POLICE They're being questioned now, one more time. There are no grounds for that. There's no question of them being detained. That's something. They'll be allowed to go, most likely without any escort, to the prefecture. There. Meaning they'll have gone to all this trouble so that, next, we ourselves go to the prefecture. And they stopped a train. Well. Bye, sister. Bye, little one. You were saying just now, Cédric, that this morning, on the train, it was really pretty absurd, this kind of... We got on the phone to the Prefect's office, who said, "Bring them here", the Border Police saying... You see? And... Well, we managed to get them there in the end. Now here we are having a bite to eat, a sublime mixed fry, in Ventimiglia. The hour on the train was truly unbelievable. - Funny, huh? - Yeah. - It's funny. - For three people... All that for three people. And the crazy thing is... You see what the system's like, in fact. A kind of infrastructure, prefecture, police, soldiers who scare people in their uniforms. The soldiers are in camouflage uniforms not to camouflage themselves, but so we see them. It reveals a system that's senseless compared with common sense, a farmer's common sense. We have a problem in the Roya Valley, we try to respond to it. We do respond, but we continue to live our lives as well. All the shit we go through, fighting every day. And they're, like... Thanks very much. I know Cédric. I don't know you, but I know a bit about Cédric. Really? - Yes, I was at Lucioles. - Oh, yes, that's right. I've seen you on TV a lot. Look, they're on the road, the other side, on the main coast road. Migrants returning. They didn't get through. They tried to get through, in groups of 2 or 3. There was a good 20 of them. - Where was that? - Back towards Ventimiglia. There are police on the main coast road, on the Italian side... The French are on the opposite side and they're stopping the cars. So one's on the lookout and the others are going back towards Ventimiglia. I don't think it's right that a human being, whoever they are, doesn't have the right... They have the right to eat, to good health. When all the roots of their country are taken away, they try to survive and it's wrong that these people don't get any help. Is what you do political or humanitarian? What I do is humanitarian, I don't do politics. There are no more borders. Anyone has the right to go to a country. You see, it's the economic system they have. They do what they do for other reasons, not the migrants, it's not our problem. Our problem is failing to help someone in danger. With all the soldiers, you'd think there was a civil war. People know what's happening, but they prefer to turn a blind eye. TUES 18:40 CEDRIC HERROU: I'VE GOT SOME VERY GOOD NEWS FOR YOU!!! PARTY AT THE BAR IN SAORGE AT 7.30 P.M. PASS IT ON. Someone come and keep Cédric warm. It was just an excuse to have a few drinks. Do you want to know or not? We know a little, but I want more details. We're allowed to cross at authorized crossing points with any asylum-seekers. We just have to make a list, give it to the police, and tell them on what day we're crossing. In fact, all that's happening is that the law is finally being obeyed. - That's right, that's all. - It's as simple as that. It's nothing out of the ordinary. What's happening is what should have been happening... - Exactly. - If the prefecture had obeyed the law. If we really can take Blacks across at the authorized crossing point... Fuck, that is good. - We must film this. - We need a film-maker. We must do that. - That is just great. - Yeah, totally. Two migrants per car, 35 cars. This is going to be awesome. Or we only take one, that amounts to 70 cars. Damn good news for the environment, 70 cars. Jump for joy, sing and dance You're so lucky to be living in France, Jump for joy, sing and dance... We offer a better quality service now. We started out with a beat-up C15, hiding eight at a time in the trunk, and now we're allowed to cross in an 807 - that's almost new. - A year and a half's work. A year and a half's work. There. - Isn't that good? - Good. - Thanks very much. - Thank you. What is the sentence you learned? I'm seeking asylum in France. Hey, you clowns, we're here. We received the message about asylum claims. We're just going to ask them - for papers, ID, if they have any. - They don't have any. - Nothing at all? - No, nothing at all. We have the list. It's my new toy, when I'm bored I go, "Hey, Mr Herrou, where is the Black in the car? "No problem?" "No, no." That's all fine. Thank you. Big boss, huh, did you see that? You'll be able to tell your kids: Cédric Herrou, the big boss. Let's have some sounds. Bye, have a good day. RECEPTION CENTER FOR ASYLUM-SEEKERS Let's go, Marco. Good, good, good... TWO WEEKS LATER THE PREFECTURE IS AGAIN PREVENTING REFUGEES FROM GOING TO NICE TO CLAIM ASYLUM. We like France very much, and its people. More than hundreds of other countries. More than hundreds of other countries. Because the French... The French... If you've found a French person, even a bad one, he won't refuse you something to eat or drink. Never. The French would never do that. Many of the Africans who have come here, many of them don't come to study. Many people have left their country because they're hungry, to escape war. But France has reestablished border controls. France has closed its border for its security. It's not because they don't want to see any more foreigners. - For its security. - But not only. - For its security. - Not only that. - What? - That's not right. It's for its security, but it's also to keep foreigners out. - No, that isn't why. - I can tell you that it is. It's for its security. We know very well. We know what's in the news from the TV, from relatives of ours in foreign countries. We know about all these things. We know about all these things. So... France closed the border for its security. I knew that before I arrived in Italy, for a few years already. What do you mean by "for its security", Moussa? For its security, to have... Why close the borders for their security? What does that mean? It means there are people who enter... Terrorists who enter the country, who are going to plant bombs everywhere. They kill people for nothing. So it's... The armies are going to close the borders and check everything. That's what it is. If they leave the borders open, everyone will come in and they'll spoil the country. They'll kill a lot of people. They're right to close the borders. NICE, MAY 25TH 2017 Ladies and gentlemen. Bear witness to what the Alpes-Maritimes prefecture is doing. No, we don't want poverty. No, we don't want destitution. Keep it hidden. Keep it hidden. Don't let it be seen. Ever! You're here, you are witnesses, you pass by, you look on, without acting. Bear witness. We won't move from this square. These people are asylum-seekers. They have the right to be in France. - Is that the baby's heartbeat? - Yes. Maybe the camera can't pick it up. - Can you hear it? - Yes. - Can you hear it? - Yes. Hold on, I'll give you some tissue. We use what's to hand. It's the cough that's giving her stomach pains. We need to be sure, if she's going to Paris, that she has somewhere to sleep. I can arrange for accommodation to be available there. It's up to us to make sure she doesn't sleep outside with the baby. The guy in Paris, I don't see how he can accommodate four people, with the baby crying and all. I don't think so. Cédric's right. He says that if you go to Paris, you won't find what you're looking for. In Libya, there are a lot of problems. Thanks be to God, God loves me. I almost died, but God protected me. One day, I was lying down and a bullet passed through the door and might otherwise have hit my head. I got up, looked around and saw people dying. There were bullets everywhere. There's war in Libya, too. That's why we left and came here. Crossing the sea in a small boat is difficult when you're pregnant, it moves around. There are no doctors. It's difficult for a pregnant woman. The voyage is a bit difficult for a pregnant woman. After, we took the train and we got off here. We had the phone number of someone here. We called him, but he didn't answer. A woman saw us. We were afraid she would call the police and that she wanted to detain us. But she just told us to get in her car. On the road there were four policemen. They saw the woman and she told me to get under the seat and hide my head. It's really very difficult for me. There would have been no problem if I hadn't been pregnant. The people who helped me treated me quite well. I'm happy. You hear that? There are some arriving. Police, police! Let's wave to the police now. Let's wave to the police. So, there are three or four observation posts. - Yeah. - Round the clock. There, one up there. One opposite, and another two above. So, they're there round the clock. They have cameras, microphones, they never let up. No. In fact, there's a massive police and military deployment and how many more just arrived? 15? - I don't know. - A good 20. Despite all the checkpoints. It shows that controlling a border isn't the same as closing it. They don't understand that what they're doing now is counterproductive. They want to close it, but people get through. If you want to control it, there needs to be supervision. They call it "reception", but the right word is "supervision". They can't see that it clearly doesn't work. Look the border is closed, walk round. - I walked round. - How many of us are there? In two days. All these people came in two days. - How many are there? More than 100. - Yes, around 100, I think. It's crazy. - There we are. - Almost bang on target. The cops up there must be going mad. - It's already been customized. - It's pink. Thanks. Joseph, you cook for how many people? About 90 people. - Today? - Yes. You are the big chef. Definitely. It makes a change from the Mediterranean, which ate them up. No? Walls are going up around the world, more and more, unfortunately. But the Roya Valley seems to me to be a place of such... It's Europe as well, with all of Europe's contradictions. All the, "What shall we do about the immigrants, the refugees?" Whereas the only solution is to welcome them with open arms. Like here, no? In this place. What a treasure we'd have. We've everything to gain by truly opening up... So that they can... The other day, we were here with Troops and there was a young man from a housing project near Paris who's come here to teach basic French. If we did that with the housing projects, so that the young people, even if they haven't had much schooling, teach... Well, maybe fewer young people would leave for Syria. You see? We'd offer the opportunity to work to kids who are a bit lost. There are a thousand... I just came up with one thing, one thousand and one reasons for saying that instead of a problem, it's a treasure that we have here. A real treasure. For all the countries in Europe. We'd have everything to gain: intelligence, labor, a thousand things... But, no, they don't want to, they're afraid. And fear rules so many places in the world. Walls are going up, in Palestine too, everywhere. But where is it leading to? JULY 2017 ONCE AGAIN, REFUGEES ARE UNABLE TO TAKE THE TRAIN TO CLAIM ASYLUM IN NICE. THE ROYA VALLEY HAS TURNED INTO THE SAME TRAP IT WAS A YEAR AGO. Do you think they'll try to stop us moving? - They can't do that. - What do we do? Tell them we'll go back, but not go back. We'll set off for the pass on foot. - We should invite the media - Forget it, that doesn't matter. - We can invite them after we leave. - Where will you cross? - Brouis Pass. - The route used by the Free French? Yes, it takes us to the Brouis Pass, we go along the track, come back down towards... At some point, there's a path. - The Bassera Valley? - That's right. We walk in the mountains for three days along the ancient salt trail, in order to get to Nice. All of this road here is to the north, and this is a path right in the valley, to the extreme north. Is it worth climbing so high? How high is it? - 1,000. - The Braus Pass is higher. - How high is the Braus? - 1,100. No, they're both 1,000 meters. But watch out coming down. CANNES RAILWAY STATION JULY 24TH 2017 I have nothing to say. I told you to move on. Leave immediately, otherwise you risk being arrested. Turn around, go left and leave. Have you heard of the right to asylum? - Have you heard of the rule of law? - Yes. It means they must claim asylum from their own country. Asylum is for victims of violence in their own countries. These are economic migrants. Really, what makes you so sure? How do you know they're migrants, do you know them? Do you know if they're on the run in their countries? You don't know, it's an interpretation. If there's any doubt... While we wait, I want to see everyone's ID. You're in an international zone, we can check your ID. I want to see everyone's ID, please. This is an international station, so show me your ID. You're American, don't meddle in other countries' affairs. - Ah, that's... - Sir, not a word from you. Let her look after her own country, it's not for her to judge. When you're in a foreign country, you don't question the laws. She should look after her own country. - She can go where she likes. - French laws are not her business. She can go where she likes. She'll learn there are rights in France. Stop filming. BORDER POLICE MENTON BORDER POST, A FEW HOURS LATER He's filming over there. Put some cardboard over it. The list was drawn up yesterday evening. There were 200 people, I think. I'm not sure how many. The lists are sent to the police and the police is supposed to send the list to the CCPD, the famous... I'm not sure what it stands for... A unit of the police and customs, customs officers. Exactly, by definition, it means they can't not know they are potential asylum-seekers. So, if they send them back to Italy, saying, readmission is... They readmit people who have shown they intend to claim asylum. What's more, with... Using procedures that prevent any appeal. That's the problem. How do you appeal afterwards? Haroun? Haroun's here. It's him. - He asked for his lawyer. - This is an administrative facility. Come on. He has an appointment tomorrow. I want to see him. No, Ma'am, this is an administrative zone. No, Sir, it's not. He has a lawyer, he wants to see me and I want to see him. It's an administrative detention zone. No, it's no such thing and you know it. Sir, show your document. Don't touch the paper. This is beyond a joke. Tomorrow he has an appointment at the prefecture, you can't send him back. - Come on. - You know you can't do this. No, he's not leaving. - He's not leaving... - Come on. You can't stop me from seeing him. Let's move. You'd better not. You know very well. Come here. It'll be all right. AIX-EN-PROVENCE COURT OF APPEAL AUGUST 8TH 2017 Is this the right place? How do I feel about the law? It's more how the law feels about me right now. Hold on, one minute. Yes, Zia? OK, I'll be right there. Whatever happens, you can appeal. OK. - Which is a good thing, I think. - Yeah. Are they going to increase it? AFTER THE VERDICT - They've raised it. - OK. They've increased it. Good morning. Can we bother you for a moment? You seem a bit down. - Disappointed. - No, angry. I put my trust in the law, I believed it was impartial. Now we see that it's not. One minute I'm asked to protect... Right now, there are 20 or so minors at my house, waiting to be looked after. Clearly, the State is asking me to look after kids it's unable to deal with. There are asylum-seekers waiting to claim asylum. We're trying to make sure the law is obeyed at the Franco-Italian border. Now I'm threatened with a 4-month suspended sentence. So, the prefecture puts children in danger, the action taken by the prefecture and ministers puts adults in danger, and I, who protect people, they threaten me with prison. I'm more than ready to go to jail, no problem. And I'll continue to fight in their prisons. My freedom will never stop at the bars of their prisons. They can do what they like to me, I'll continue, I won't stop. - You're determined. - Much more. I won't be corrupted by threats. I'm not cowardly, I won't be corrupted by threats. I'll continue, for sure. Isn't a suspended jail sentence more serious? Yes, good job there's no death penalty, why not lynch me and burn me as well? I mean, or... I can't wait for 30 years from now. - Doesn't it scare you nevertheless? - No, it annoys me. - Isn't there a real risk of jail? - Well, I'll write a book in jail. No, jail's no big deal. You know, freedom is something much bigger, much nobler than that. Justice is far more precious than that. Do you think the State is the criminal party here? Yes, of course. I should have come with the kids, come here and then... Let them talk to these 14-year-old kids. The other day, a kid turned up at my house with no trousers, and they're telling me, "no, Mr Herrou, it's outrageous, "smuggling people like them across." I think that if the migration was from northern Europe, little blond-haired, blue-eyed girls and boys, I think the law would act, would react differently. I think that the State is racist. These are dark times for France and Europe, I think it's up to citizens to raise the game. If the law is poorly represented, we must represent it. That's what we'll do. Our role, as citizens of a democracy is to step in when the State fails. We will respond and I hope in increasing numbers. You can be confident. Because we are defending life. Don't forget that. We're defending people. They may be Black, but they have a right to be defended, a right to be protected. Don't forget that. You can be confident, even if we stand accused today, we'll be acquitted in 10, 20, 30 years' time, however long it takes. I'm bound to go to jail, I'll go to jail, but I'll go with dignity, with my head held high. I'll continue to fight behind their bars, no problem. I'll continue by writing, by speaking out. It will be up to you to take over from me, to make sure the camp at my home continues. The prisons are too small to lock us all up. Let's continue the fight. I really want them to know that I won't stop. It doesn't work like that. I'm a farmer and farmers are stubborn. I'm a Breton farmer, and they're more stubborn. I'm a Calabrian Breton farmer, and they're more stubborn still. I'm a German Calabrian Breton farmer and they're even more stubborn again. What do you think, Michel? I think that... I think you're going to jail. Which means we'll get some time off. - I'll be able to have a rest. - You'll end up going. For sure. That's where we're heading. Beer is what I'll miss. Will l be able to have a beer pump brought into jail? We'll help you. It's mind-boggling. A farmer going to prison is not what's serious, no big deal. It's the direction the law is going in that's serious. Who cares about a farmer going to jail? The serious thing is what's happening. What's happening from a political point of view. Now we'll see how the police, the cops respond. Now, they'll... I think there'll be no more room for discussion, no more courtesy. - No more what? - Courtesy. Courtesy. Before they trod carefully, they weren't sure... Should they be doing this, not doing it? Now that they've found you guilty, no way. I think the game's up. It'll be no holds barred now. The crazy thing is... We still don't know what to do with the people at my house. What do we do? They're saying to me... They tell me what not to do, but not what I should do. No one has an answer to that simple question. What do we do with the minors and the asylum-seekers? No answer. NOVEMBER 2017 Now they've stopped coming here, it's back to work, huh? Life's almost back to normal. There's some catching up to do. How long is it since you worked on your olives? Last year, it started too early, I had the trial at the same time. The olive crop was too premature. You usually start in January, and I had to start in December, November, and the trial fell in the middle of all that. So it wasn't feasible. - This year, you're starting over? - Yes, but with a small crop. The olive trees have been around for 200 years. They're in no hurry. - They've seen a few things, huh? - Yes. For sure. Today, refugees no longer venture into the Roya Valley. The State has succeeded in neutralizing the valley. For 3 years, we've fought to offer thes people more or less decent conditions and to allow them to claim asylum. They now cross farther to the north, into the Briançon region, where local people have taken over from those in the Roya Valley and fight on. It's been hurting for a while. It hurts from here to here. There's something wrong with it. Shame it's not your only problem. Get the Border Police to sort the olives. I noticed there are green and black ones mixed together. The paths in the Roya Valley are easily accessible because the valley is located in the southernmost part of the Alps. For more than three millennia, the Roya has been traversed by successive waves of migration. Today deserted, these paths have made, are making, and will continue to make the history of this valley. Once again, others will cross the Tende Pass, the Baisse di Peyrafica, Casterino, the Pas du Diable, the Arpette, the Fenêtres Pass, the Muratone Pass, the Madonina, the Bendola, the Paganin Gorges, the Orneil, Breil, Saorge, Paspus, Panigore, Bancaou, Piène Haute, the Brouis Pass, Sospel, Fanghetto, Olivetta...
