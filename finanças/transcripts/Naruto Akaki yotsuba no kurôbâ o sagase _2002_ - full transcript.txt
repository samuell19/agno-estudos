NIN Big brother. Naruto! I tell you it will happen. I swear I'll help you! Wake up! I appoint you leader of the Konohamaru Corps. What's up? This is your mission - find the red four-leaved clover! FIND THE RED FOUR-LEAVED CLOVER What is the Konohamaru Corps? It's a newly formed corps. I see. Well, how many members has it got? Right now there's just the leader, Naruto, and myself. You should have told me if it's just make-believe. Naruto, this is not a game. An important and dangerous mission is waiting for you. What's this about a red four-leaved clover, then? Why do you have to find it? Well, actually... There's a girl I like at the academy. Her name is Yoshino Kaede. She's very cute and has a great personality. She's a really sweet girl. But... Kaede, are you leaving the academy? I have to go to another village because of my father's work. - When? - Tomorrow evening. Really? We'll miss you. I don't want to go. I don't want to leave you all. If only we had a red four-leaved clover, we could do something. A red four-leaved clover? Yes. There's only one of them in Akagahara. They say all wishes will be fulfilled if you get hold of it. But Akagahara is a strictly forbidden place, isn't it? That's true. It's impossible. By the way, have you seen Konohamaru? I want to say goodbye to him, but he's not around. He's nowhere to be seen. Konohamaru, are you in love with that girl? You want to fulfil her wish. Yeah. You're the only one who would do it with me. I beg you. - It's a mission. - Yes. I get it. I'll do it! It's always the same. Teacher Kakashi is late. Yeah. But Naruto is late too. Maybe this could be a romantic time just for us. Go for it! Sasuke? Good morning, Sakura! What bad timing! I'm going to Akagahara on a plunging mission! - We'll be back before Kakashi comes! - See you! - A plunging mission? - To Akagahara? So the two of them are going in there. It's a dangerous, forbidden place. NO NOVICE NINJA MUST ENTER So this is Akagahara. It's over there. That's where the red-leaved clover is. Hey, it's easy. There are lots of traps to keep intruders out. You could have said that before. I hear they used to do ninja commander tests here. Ninja commander tests here? Then we have to suffer if we want to help. I'll show them! Sorry I'm late. An old lady asked me for directions on the way. You're lying! Where's Naruto? He said something about a plunging mission. Plunging mission? I never heard of that. I don't know if it's true, but... He said they were going to Akagahara. Akagahara? Really? If that's true, Naruto will die. That's for sure. Watch out! To the left! Run! Turn right! Use your head! We've been running for hours for nothing! I know. Turn right! - Do something about it! - Left! Art of the Shadow Doppelganger! You fool! What's this explosion good for? I thought it would be good to be in the air. I think it worked, Konohamaru. We made it! It's full of red clovers. Oh, the miracle of love! Great, isn't it? Right! Look for it! There isn't any! There isn't any! It took four hours to get here. Even if we find it right now, we need four hours to get home. No matter what, we won't make it before Kaede leaves. It's hopeless! There's nothing to do! Kaede! Don't be stupid! Don't even think it's impossible! - Naruto? - Don't give up. But what are we to do? Look for it! You have to look for it. Think about what comes next later. Bye, everyone. Bye, Konohamaru. - I found it! - What? - Did you find it? - Yeah, but I can't reach. Right. It's too far away. I got it! We did it! What's this? DO NOT ENTER I'm getting nostalgic. I took my ninja commander test here. It looks pretty rough. Naruto must have walked into most of the traps. It looks bad. The kumutsu ninja are activated. It'll be good training for you. - What? - I'll give you a mission. Go and rescue Naruto and Konohamaru. What? So this is Akagahara. We will test our skills. - Sasuke. - Off you go, then. Leave it to me, Konohamaru. Find a gap and run for it. But you can't fight them on your own. Don't worry, just go. Don't you want so see Kaede again? Naruto. Why? Why are you fighting so hard? You said it was a mission. A ninja sees his mission to the end! I won't work if you don't push. I've been on many boring missions. But no matter how boring, it feels great when it's accomplished. I just love that moment. Fireball Technique! Ouch! Pull yourself together. - Sasuke. - Do you only talk big or what? I won't let you beat me. Naruto! Teacher Kakashi told us. If you put the statue back, the kubutsu ninja will stop. If you fight against this many, you really will die. Is it that statue? Did you hear, Konohamaru? Is that a mission? - Right. - Is it a mission? - Yes. - I got it. I'll do it! These guys, they appear all unprepared and use up their chakura. It's heavy. Don't give up. Don't give up. Still not done, Konohamaru? I'm doing it! It's chakura. Is it Mogei? No matter what, I won't give up! We made it. You all did very well. See? You can do it if you try. Sorry. - Do you have it, Konohamaru? - It's safe. Just look at this. This is a red four-leaved clover. Kaede, it will fulfil your wish. Konohamaru, you got it for me. Does that fulfil wishes? Who knows? In the old days, the novice ninja dreamt of becoming the best. And they all entered Akagahara. Only those who returned safely were recognised as commanders. That became the legend that wishes would be fulfilled. Is that what we went through all that for? I'm sure something good came out of your suffering. Kaede, it's time to go. It didn't work because a leaf fell off. No, Konohamaru. My wish has been fulfilled. If I have this, it's like being with you. Thank you. See you. That was good, Konohamaru. Let's get back to our main mission. Now? Let's have a meal at Ichiraku. Yes. I'll show them! - That's not the end of it, though. - Gakuenji!
