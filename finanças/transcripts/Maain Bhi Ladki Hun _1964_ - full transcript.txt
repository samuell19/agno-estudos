Do you steal and eat things from your own home? Ganga, am I a thief? No, you are a gentleman. But you lose your health. How many times did the doctor say sugar? These are poison for a diabetic. Doctors are very selfish. They eat, but do not let others eat. you are right. Now get out of here. go to bed. Parvati, do you see how I am treated after you leave this house? I am not allowed to eat sweets. They think I'm crazy. Do you know why you are in this situation? Because every moment you are lost in thoughts about madam. Try to forget her and you can be better. What did you say, forget Parvati? Forget the person who was the pride of my house? No, Ganga. She is not only my wife, Like a minister giving advice. Like a slave who serves his master. And like a mother who is close in times of sorrow and happiness. You want me to forget such a woman? Remember, Madame wore silver rings. As she walked, the walls of this mansion echoed with their voices. I still hear that at night. It's unfortunate that I don't get to spend more time with her. This mansion is now a ruined memory of Parvati. You are the only one who serves me so well. We shared blood ties in our previous lives. - If not for you, I would have died long ago. - No, sir. do not say that. God has given you two sons. Ram and Bali love you very much. Elder Ram, painting all day. And the younger son is rambling. Like he was going to be a driver. It is the job of parents to guide their children. Even after madam's death, they were not searched for. Ram is big now. He should think about his marriage. I want to find a girl. Parvati's only desire was a daughter-in-law. She must be very beautiful and talented. Our home needs to be refreshed. If we can find such a girl, I have no objection. Let's find such a girl. If she is not a living image of Parvati's dreams... ...She can never be a daughter-in-law in this house. Your wish will surely come true. Sleep and I'll massage your feet. - A ghost. - A ghost, where is it? He is standing before me. Not a ghost, but a demon's husband. I had to look at this soapy face early in the morning. A man going to work shaves early in the morning. But you are like a leech. A person who stays away from others. - what did you say? - Why are you scaring me? Even that old man calls you a leech. Shameless then? While dying, my sister Parvati had told our brother-in-law "See, he is my only brother." "Good but a little stupid" "He didn't get to marry anyone else." "That's because he's married." "Take care of his children after my death" And now you and I, Lallu, are living without a sister. Sister indeed. They feed you like they feed the dogs at home... ...Except what he has done for you. Do you have the right to even a penny in this house? - So what should I do? - Stand up with your efforts. Carve earth, cut wood and earn money. How can a gentleman like me do such a lowly job? The work should be commensurate with my honor and position. OK, Dad. You are exactly right. - Shut up, idiot. - You call my son a fool? I am sorry. Shut up you stupid son...,happy now? - Why haven't you gone to school yet? - I don't go to school. - why? - I am 14 years old now. I should be in 8th grade by now. But I'm still in third grade. What is my honor, going to school and being insulted? Donkey, do you see what this is? Give it to me when I grow up. Now keep it with you. Get out of here, idiot. What did you do to your face? I was about to shave when my wife called me. You have good news early in the morning. - what? - Mr., consented to Ram's marriage. He said that the girl should be very beautiful and talented. They said that I want to be a girl who brings life to our house like madam. But if she doesn't, she will have to leave the threshold of this house... He also warned that they will not be allowed to come. is it? Go... you go. Look at this. Beloved! Does that mean she will be my sister-in-law? hello Are you taking her to the Kalabhavana competition? Driver, put this in the car. What do you think? she is good - Right...? - excellent. She is fantastic. What hat are you wearing? You look like an engine driver. where are you going All my college friends are going on a picnic. I, too, go with them. - Okay, go. - Congratulations, brother. Since when did you learn to bless like an adult? you idiot. Is blessing the reserved property of the elderly? "These Days of Happiness" "Time to Look at the Girls" "The days of dropping handkerchiefs, changing postures" "these days" "This is what is called youth" "These Are Careless Days" "This is the music of brave hearts" "The Ring of These Jesters" "Don't try to convince them otherwise." "This is what they have to say." "These days of happiness..." "Longing Nights Are Young" "Wishing Days Are Beautiful" "The heart makes new intentions every day" "Intentions are intentions" "This is what they have to say." "These days of happiness..." "We shall never have such encounters again, such a beautiful sight again." "These princes are somewhere, the princesses are somewhere else." "Start singing, that's what songs are about" "These days of happiness..." The winner of this competition, Mr. Ram... ...a picture of a beautiful woman has been drawn. Maybe he even wants to marry such a woman. Mr. Ram, our elders have said that marriage is a matter of destiny. God decides this. Friends, is art today only limited to beauty? I think there is something more important than beauty. That is, the nature and character of a person. Our other artists, our character should also be brought into a picture. - I would like to say something. - Tell me. Dear Chairman and my artist friends! Perhaps the chairman is trying to say... ...Maybe there can be no character where there is beauty. I would like to say. Great artists have painted pictures of Goddess Lakshmi and Saraswati. Aren't those pictures beautiful? If so, do they have no character? There is one more thing that makes me laugh when I think about it. That marriage is a matter of destiny. But I think every young person today likes... ...marry a beautiful girl. Even I care to do so. I prove that marriage is not in God's hands but in our own hands. "The Great International Stos" A thief who stole from a shop was sentenced to prison. Lord Bhagavan, why do you read such bad news? Read some good news about murders and robberies. There is such news, listen. A 90-year-old man killed his 70-year-old wife. Suspecting her infidelity. Do you think these are free sir? You are still reading about old debts. Be careful what you say. Tell me how much I owe you. ok 78 rupees. Now eat with it for 80 rupees. 80 rupees are you whispering? Make it 100 rupees. How can I make it 100 until I give you another 20 bucks worth of stuff? Why should I buy your old stuff? We can do one thing. Give me 20 rupees. Yes, then you owe me 100. - Then give me 20 rupees. - Here. Raja, why did I give you 20 rupees? Raja, don't deceive me. I am a very poor man. Besides, I have two unmarried sisters. I have been trying to marry the older one for a long time. But I think she will remain celibate for life. just wait. why are you waiting She is my sister. That's why I look up to her. What fool wouldn't want to marry her? She is the youngest Chanda. She is studying graduation. I am worried about Rajni who is older than her. - Whoever comes to visit her, they like Chanda. - Why is that? She is not fair, she is not educated. And she is not sociable. She is not fair, she is not educated. She got out of the house... ...He has warned that he will not let go. You may know T Bhagwan, owner of International Stores. You think I know every idiot in town? Complete what you came to say. He has a sister. Indeed, she is very beautiful. She is beautiful and has big eyes. I saw her from afar, no, I even saw her up close. I shouted, Sister Parvati. Then I realized what I was saying. That's when I came to know that she was Bhagavan's sister. Is she very beautiful? And her name is very beautiful, Chanda. No, not Chanda. Her name is Rajni. She is studying graduation. So why not talk about Ram's marriage with her? Let's go see the girl. What are you saying, Ganga? Have I ever left the house after Parvati's death? Only my coffin will leave this house again. Why talk like that? I'm sorry, I said that by mistake. all right. Look, tomorrow is Wednesday, a good day. You go there with Ram and Balraj and see the girl. Perhaps this useless man is destined to do one good deed. Brother, I live from you, so I want to tell you something The name of the store may be "Great International Stores". But it is a small shop. They are not rich. I don't mind it. I had a lot of money, but could I save Parvati? I only want a beautiful daughter-in-law as per Parvati's wish. Okay then, I'll go and talk to them. - Really? - I swear. Lalaj's elder and younger son are coming to visit your sister. is it? So I will go to the village today and bring Rajni. Isn't she here? No, she lives with her grandmother in the village. Then let her be there. But you said that the young man was coming to see Rajni. Let him come. Is your sister Chanda here? Ask her to welcome guests. Even if they check the subscription, you don't need to worry. It can't be done. Will Chanda or Rajni get married? Yes, that's right. Why do Chanda accept guests? Look, Raja, I may be poor, but I'm not a fraud. - Don't teach me to cheat. - Then don't. Keep your sister unmarried at home for life. Why is it a hindrance to sister's happiness? Do you want to ruin her life? No, I will not be an obstacle to your sister's life. She always sacrificed her happiness for me and Chanda. But Raja, remember one thing. My sister is illiterate. We are poor. Let me do this thing, I will fix Rajni's life. Remember one thing. We will be here tomorrow at five o'clock. don't forget She is about to come. Everyone take a good look at her. Ram, don't faint after seeing the girl. send her where is your brain - In the cash box of my shop. - I know it. - Where is your sister? - In the village... you idiot! She is inside. Ask to bring tea. Why do they take so long? I'll go inside and see what happens where are you going You interfere with everything. she is coming She is Bhagavan's sister. tea - Are you studying? - Yes, in the final year of graduation. - Which school? - Not going to school to graduate. For graduation... I have forgotten it because I stopped studying. Uncle, you didn't go to school, then... ...how do you know the name of a college? Forget all that. You saw the bride well, didn't you? - what did you say? - Lord! Sister, your sister-in-law is calling you. go inside If you want to ask questions now, ask me. Why should I ask you? Ganga, you tell me, how is the girl? - Like... - Shut up. She is very beautiful and beautiful. When I saw her, I remembered madam. - How educated is she? - She is studying for her degree. - Shut up, leeches. - Yes Lalaji, she is studying graduation. Good! Then she is suitable for our house. Parvati's dream will come true. Fix the wedding date next month. - Will the marriage take place in this house? - Then where else? - I don't think it's possible. - why? The girl fell into a well when she was young. As she survives, her marriage to the village god... Her parents have promised that it will happen in the future. Then she should not break that promise. Let it be the village wedding. - I won't be able to attend. - it is good. - Does that mean? - I mean the marriage will take place there. But acceptance is given here. This is a problem for our family's honor. It would be better if we bear all the wedding expenses. What do you say, Ganga? i understand You will be given your commission. I will give you money. Silently give it to the young lady's brother. Tell him it is a matter of our honor. Every ritual should be performed with pomp. Don't even tell Ram about this. Your wish sir. Are you happy Parvati? Your dream daughter-in-law is coming. Ganga, do you see a smile on Parvati's lips? Wherever you are, our son's wedding... ...sure the band is playing. You hear it, don't you? Come with the bride. Why do you rise, are you the bride? - I will bring the bride. - She knows the way, you stay there. why late Good or bad. Come quickly with the bride. Raja, you manage the affairs now. Why do you tell me? The priest calls the bride. Go and bring your sister. where are you going Go inside and bring sister. - Priest, finish the rites quickly. - Come with the bride. Switch garlands. Look at the face of your bride. Stop! This marriage is impossible. The bride has been transferred. She is very colorful like a witch. She is not the young woman shown to us They deceived us. What I do? My wife screams. Raja, save me. My honor is in your hands. You run away from here, I'll take care of everything. We are deceived. Lallu's father. were are you? - I'm here. - Why are you silent after seeing this injustice? I am not silent. I wonder what to do. Call the police. But the marriage is over now. I teach them a lesson. They show us a beautiful young woman but the real bride is ugly. Where is Bhagavan? the cheater wait First of all tell me where this poor girl should go now. - To hell! Why are we looking for it? - That's easy for you to say. But imagine how that poor girl must have felt. She came with a smile on her face. Now she is shedding tears. I know why she is crying. She dreamed of becoming the daughter-in-law of a rich man. She cries because she lost that opportunity. Be it the daughter-in-law of a rich man or a poor man... ...If a girl's marriage stops midway, her life is ruined. We are not guilty, we have been deceived. She cannot be our Ram's bride. Keep this seasonal colored moon in your home But now she has lost this house too. What will the poor girl do? She will hang herself. And you can die by drinking poison for that heartache. If you cannot drink poison, you will jump into the well. What do we lose? At most, the villagers will accuse us of her death. But we will not destroy our son's life by being afraid of that mud. Why should he be a scapegoat? - Get up, Ram. - You are not feeling well. - You mean... - Shut up! I heard everything. Now listen to me. I will marry this girl. Complete the practices. Why is this? Do it right. Leave this here. Okay, you all go. Parvati, I wish you were here. Then you bear witness to all this. When the bride comes, the whole house will be lit up. Parvati, a fairy is coming home today. No, cousin, a witch is coming to this house. - What nonsense are you talking about? - Listen. The bride's family cheated us. They showed us a beautiful young woman. But when they got married, they brought an ugly girl. Someone who could not marry. - Are you telling the truth? - Why am I lying to you? You can see that ugly witch. So why did Ram agree to get married? Not only you but the whole world is listening to it. The girl's family has deceived us. But why did Ram agree? I tried to explain to him not to marry her but he insisted. I begged him that you would never… ...not to give consent, but he didn't care. I said this ugly woman has no place in our house. He said that she has a place in his heart. I warned him that you could have a heart attack. He said it doesn't matter What was the end result? The marriage took place, our family's honor was lost. That ugly woman is brought here. Stop, that music! Turn off the lights. There are no celebrations here. Do not let the bride enter, close the gate. It is my order. Turn off the lights, stop the band playing. Chandan Singh, why did you turn off the lights? Why was the gate closed? Sir, orders have been given. I will call father to open the gate. Why be afraid, my son tells you. Come on, sister-in-law. The cousin was not that thing. The order you gave. - Who says that? - I mean. - They are all in. - How did they do it? Chandan Singh. Sir, there is nothing wrong with Chandan Singh. - Father... - Your father is dead. Who are you talking to now? Father, your son has done nothing to close your door on him. - Of course, I made you proud. - Ask my heart what you have done. Do you think the person you marry can be my daughter-in-law? That thing happened, why argue about it? what did you say? But why did it happen? At whose will? only you Now ask me what I want. Get out of this house. - And don't come back here. - Let's go, brother. Sometimes dad thinks that life can only be lived in mansions. That we have no place to stay outside this mansion. Let's go. I will come with you too. He also tries to follow his exiled elder brother. - Go too. - Yes dad, we are going. But we are not Ram and Lakshman who cries for father. Instead, our father is... ...that heartless rich man who doesn't even give a blessing. It was for his son and daughter-in-law. Why live with such a heartless man? what did you say? There is nothing wrong with these children. It's all my fault. Is it your fault? Then you leave this house first. - I am...? - Yes. Should I leave, sir? Who was born to serve you? Madam, if you were there today, would you let your sons out? The daughter-in-law who came home as a new bride. Accept her like this? Do you tolerate this injustice? Sir, even though I was told to leave a thousand times. I am not going. I also have a right to this house. A dog's right. His master beats him. But he doesn't leave. He still guards the house. If you cannot give your blessing to your children. At least allow me to take mother's blessings. I am begging you. Don't come between mother and son. Let everyone stay here. Come daughter-in-law, get mother's blessing. Come on. Did you see what Ram did Parvati? Did you give them your blessing? No, I know you don't. You have asked for brightness for this house. But Ram brought home a colorful night. This house is in darkness, I can't see anything. I am also a girl. Wedding day in every girl's life... ...bringing the message of hope. But my wedding day brought something else. I know it's dark. Has this fact not been revealed to you? Tell me, did you fall into the dark? I swear I didn't know that. After years of frustration... ...I said I was going to get married. A new world was created before my eyes. I was told, my husband is very handsome. I thought God didn't make me beautiful. But by giving me a handsome partner… ...completed this lack of mine. I was told that my husband is well educated. Every book in the world opened before my eyes. When asked that you are very rich... ...I was really scared. Why on earth would you take me poor to such a rich house I thought. But he did. And when I come here as a bride... ...No band played, no lights on. I have heard that when a new bride comes to her husband's house... ...that the whole house is lit up. But maybe I've come to this house to swallow it in the dark. Why does God allow young women like me to be born? Why not make them die before they get married? No Rajni, life means living. Should I live, will I be given that life? do you accept me But I think every young person today likes... ...Imagine that he is marrying the most beautiful woman. Even I think so. I prove that marriage is not in God's hands but in our own hands. Why did you close your ears? Do you mind if I ask if you accept me or not? I'm sorry, but tell me, do you like me? Rajni, I love your character. Then... Do you worship? This noble lady is worthy of worship. Like you, even madam takes bath early and wears Sadhilingam. Surya is worshiped. Her fingers and bracelets glow as she moves around the house Like the goddess of wealth dropping gold coins. - is it? - Yes. The gentleman says he can still hear the fingers and bangles. Is father not well? He gets angry at every little thing. His health is deteriorating because madam died. He likes sweets very much. But he is diabetic. The doctor has strictly forbidden him sweets. He keeps getting angry about this. He vents his anger in front of Madam's picture. Like she's still alive. At first it is difficult to understand him. But once you get to know him, he really is an angel. I'm telling the truth. Did you come here too? The whole family are frauds. - what did you say? - Welcome. I'm very sorry! Sir, you are trying to be so comfortable... ...This is not your living room. This is a library. - Is this a library? - Yes. Learn some manners before coming here. Good people should show good manners. - But not to cheaters. - Who have I fooled? Did you forget so quickly, our brother? Showed your face and married my sister. Don't accuse without knowing. My family sent me to serve tea to the guests. I don't know more than that. You study in college but have no brain. I know you are all thieves. - Shut up. - Shut up too. If you have a personal problem, go out and fight. People come to the library to learn, not to fight. God bless you! Instead of my brother, there was someone else that day... ...then the honor of your family will be tarnished. Tell my brother to change the name of his shop... The name Maha International Store... ...called the Great International Fraud Production Company. If my brother is a cheater, what kind of person is your Raja uncle? He cheated my innocent sister. I will prove it in court if necessary. - Is uncle involved in this? - Yes. "Your Love" Last time I was here you were getting better. What happened now? Do you eat sweets? There is no sweetness left in my life. It is bitter. - When will that day come? - What day is it, Lalaji? - The day of my death. - Why do you say that? What are you missing? what do i have Whatever I long for, I don't get it. I should have died with Parvati. I didn't, and that's why I'm being punished. - Make peace, sir. - Doctor, where do I find peace? I know, I find it in my death. It is only by my death. Is that you, how are you? - Very hot. - But the weather is very cold. So go and enjoy. why are you standing here are you alone I thought there were fans all around. Now we can talk freely. - Shut up. - You are used to saying it very well. If someone bothers you, you tell them to shut up. If someone shows you love, you tell them to shut up. - Keep your love to yourself. - I came to return "your love". - what did you say? - This book. You left it at the library. Here on page 32, you have underlined a phrase. "If you understand each other, it's either love or enmity." - Shall I drop you off at home? - There is a limit to shamelessness. Are you going, or should I call the police? A bus strike has started. Don't wait for buses. - How do I get home now? - Then I will go. What am I doing now? - Listen. - Yes? If you don't get angry... sit down Listen! Captain Bali embarks on his love plane. Please fasten your wristband. Let's go slow. Stop. If you don't stop, I'll fall. please stop. Why is this? You let me down on purpose. - I'm done. - What happened? nothing you go. get up - What? - My leg is broken. - Oh my God. Not that, this. It's over now, call an ambulance. ok Chanda, bring two glasses of sherbet. Cheater! "The woman came very proud" "all dressed up" "Where are you going now with your face down" "my love" Your eyes express love, but…” "Your face shows anger" "If the wind honors you, what will happen" "The woman came very proud" "This is a bad habit of the beautiful, they torture first." "Then one day, they will pour their hearts out." "They are very welcoming." "The woman came very proud" The art is beautiful. Along with beauty, one also has emotions and character I used to think that music is created when an instrument is played with the fingers. But even toes can make music. I never expected that. Come on. what are u doing? I saw what instrument your feet play. - They are finger rings. - Do you like tinkle sound? I have heard that the mother in this house makes noises from her finger rings. Once upon a time. I put them on waiting for the tinkle again. So there is a story behind the finger rings. This is an interesting book about art. Very interesting things have been written about the art and the artist. I read half, you read to me. - I am...? - Yes, read from here. what are you thinking read out. When a wife reads, people say... ...that her sweet voice soothes her husband's heart. Let me see if this is true or false. It's late now, I'll go see dad. Rajni, how many times have I told you that father should not go ahead. But you don't ask. You leave smiling and come back crying. Sit here and read me this book. I'll go see if he needs anything. I will see if he went to bed. You read this. - Why, sir? - Did you hear that too? - what? - Tinkle sound of finger rings. - No. - Parvati had come. You must be dreaming. No, she put the blanket on me herself. As she left, the room echoed with her ringing fingers. She must have gone towards the verandah. Go and see. - Isn't that Parvati? - No, that niece. What right does she have to wear rings on her fingers? How brave she is. Go and ask them to remove the bracelets. - No, I'm not going. - You don't? OK then I will. see. I told you, you would laugh and cry and come back. This is what happens here all the time. Rajni, you are trying to win over father with your love and good nature. But it is impossible. All you get from him is hatred. You can never love him. Your father don't let you come in front of him... ...will you stop going in front of him? If he blames you, do you take it as an insult? What insult is that? After all, he is my father. He is my father too, isn't he? So I always try to win his heart. - Am I wrong? - No, but father is like that. He does not appreciate your love and care. Don't cry queen. Glory to Lord Krishna! I had to see your face on Lord Krishna's birthday, didn't I? I'm sure some disaster will happen today. Give me that. Everyone says you are the color of time, like a flag. Why not stay away from everyone? No one has seen your horoscope, no one has seen your elders. After you land in this house… ...surprised that the gentleman is sick again. You will find peace only after his death. "Krishna..." "Oh Kalavarna Krishna" "What is your revenge?" "By giving me the color of your skin" "Krishna" "Everybody Worships the Darkness" "But the color of time eludes man" "You are lost in the music of your flute" "Why should you care if others are treated unfairly" "Krishna" "I Can't Hide My Time-Colored Face" "I can't show how fair my heart is" "If You Gave Me a Good Heart" "Why didn't you give the world a good show?" "Krishna" Two, three, four... Where did you get the sweets? Ram bought them and came. Rajani gave them to me. - is it? Give them to me. - I don't give. You should not eat sweets, you are diabetic. - Shut up kid. Don't give me advice. give - I don't give. Go...I will eat sweets today even if I lose my life. You... why are you following me like the devil? You have decided to starve me. take my life - Ganga, did you see? - Yes, sir. I saw it. I saw Rajni taking poison from your hand. I heard you telling him to leave. Even if a girl's parents are alive... ...After marriage, her mother-in-law and father-in-law become her parents. Imagine a person who lost his parents at an early age... ...how much she loves her father-in-law? If you can't appreciate her love... ...At least don't get in her way. Her only fault is that she wants to serve you. - Is it a sin? - Even you have started questioning me now. Do you know that Ram always brings sweets to his wife. Both sit and enjoy sweets. - I won't stop them. - No sir, I know. Rajani doesn't even look at sweets. - Is she diabetic? - No, it's because you don't eat sweets. Even she won't eat them. Why does she do that? The doctor has forbidden me to eat sweets. I am an old man. But she is a young girl. If her husband brings her sweets... ...she must eat them. If she doesn't eat now, when will she eat? Ask to go and eat sweets. - No sir, how can I tell her? - Why is that? Whenever she comes to your room, you show her anger. You drive her away. Knowing this, you can give her sweets… ...How could she believe that she was asked to eat? Now I am old and sick for many years. If I say things, should she take them seriously? This is his house too. He has every right to be here. Here everything will happen according to her will. - Doesn't she have a right to this house? - Indeed. But Rajni knows you hate her kala varna skin. Is the color skin a sin? Isn't lord krishna kaala varna? - Do we hate him? - Of course not. Even Koula is the color of time. But do we block our ears from hearing that sweet voice? Even you are the color of time. No, I'm not insulting you. Does that mean I don't like you? So why should Rajni make it an issue? - Yes, sir? - How dare she come to my room? are you telling me This is my home. I have every right to come here. Ganga, tell him that. - I don't want breakfast. Tell her that. - He has to eat. Ganga, tell him. Say I don't eat. why not? No one in this house is in command except me. Ganga, tell him. No one is afraid of me, am I in that situation? - So...? - Why should a daughter fear her father? Father... Am I a father? Daughter... Ganga, did you hear that? I am a father. - Rivers are not here. - Did he go? Trickster! Seeing the situation, he left. - I heard you don't eat sweets. - Yes. What the father cannot eat, how can the child eat? what kind of girl are you You will have to eat sweets from today. If you refuse, I will start eating them. I'm sorry, Dad, but today you're fine... ...I will share sweets with you on that great day. Will you make sweets for me when I get better? That day will be the biggest celebration for this family. Dad, what sweets do you like? I love all sweets since childhood. - Now eat this. - Do I have to eat this? - Should I eat it? - Yes. - Okay, if you say... Oh my god! Bali is injured. - What happened, Bali? - God, how did this happen to you? I fell off the scooter. Fortunately, our doctor left. You are still working as a child. How many times have I told you not to drive too fast? Don't worry, it's just a simple fracture. I will visit my husband. Come and relax, I will make you some milk. Look, because my brother-in-law is hurt... ...she is very worried. is bali ok I think there is nothing to fear. I told you, it was a simple fracture. Why don't you look at him? You are fine now. No doctor, you examined him, why should I go? After Parvati's disappearance... ...I didn't really care about my children. They know how I am. They don't even ask me. All things happen automatically Pumpkin Paratha! I love pumpkin parathas. I eat a lot today. Food and hunger are yours. Eat as much as you like. Sister, you have made my favorite dish. But I can't eat like this. Give me rice and a glass of milk like always. - I will drink. - I will feed you. No, I eat after my bandage is removed. - Why should I bother you? - If your mother were alive today... ...she feeds you, you call that trouble? to eat Too much salt? No, sister-in-law, today I understand how a mother is worthy of her son. After childhood, today I see my mother in your form. Bali, the brother-in-law is like a son to his sister. Sister in law, I am very lucky. I got a lovely angel sister-in-law like you. You always smile. I always pray for it. Brother Bali Who eats that food? That's Bali. Who feeds him? Oh that queen. Why is Rajni feeding him? oh That is what broke Bali's hand. Ganga, can any daughter-in-law be like that? I am not worried about my house now. I am completely relaxed now. drink milk Are you meditating? do you do yoga - Oh shit. - Why, what happened? An all India art competition is scheduled to be held in Delhi. I was imagining a beautiful picture for it. But you broke my concentration. Drink milk first. Then close your eyes. Then you get good ideas. - Can I get ideas from drinking milk? - Yes. In how many days will you finish this painting? If I can get an idea, within a day. In a day...? Yes, or maybe three days, three weeks. If I don't have a good idea, it can even go three months. - Three months. - are you leaving? - why? If you go, I can think. Please go. What a beautiful picture. Why are you looking at me like that? You look different. change? so did I. - No, there is a difference. - What's the difference? You have a glow on your face. There is a sparkle in your eyes. I am sure there is some secret behind it. There is no secret. You look at me like you look at your paintings. I know what you are hiding. I know it since few days. - What do you know? - Shall I tell you? He has grown up because he started eating on time. - No, it's not. - So what is it? Really... - Father is speaking. - He always calls you. - tell me. - I'll come back and tell you. Come back soon. - Queen. - Now when you say her name happily... ... Even the walls of this mansion rejoice. Ganga, stop your talk. - Did you call me dad? - You cooked delicious food today. - Me, licking my fingers. - It's not as interesting as you say. Season well. Here, smell it. Smell it. Ganga, what happened to Rajni, why did she leave? Don't look at me, go look. Go. daughter in law... - Lakshmi, what happened to her? - I'll tell you. - Mr. - Why, Rivers? - You are going to be a grandfather. - A grandfather...? - Am I really going to be a grandfather? - That's what I said. come with me Parvati, I am going to be a grandfather and you are going to be a grandmother. Sir, if it's a boy, we'll name him after you. Ganga, I was never so happy to be a father that day. Now that I am a grandfather. A third heir comes to Parvati's house. Lord, let me hold my grandson in my lap for once. And then I don't mind if I die. Sir, you will even attend your grandson's wedding. I am not so greedy, this little happiness is enough for me. Where is that painter? Ram! Useless children, they don't care about the house. I will take care of him. what's wrong dad You should take special care of Rajni. - Yes, father. - Yes, it doesn't matter. You paint all day long. Think about Rajni too. My medicine shop... - Ganga, which shop is that? - Rajdan Medicine Shop. - Yes. Rajdan Medicine Shop. Go there and get pure Kashmiri saffron. Let the queen drink milk with them daily. Give it to her yourself. why are you looking at me See, a wife serves her husband all her life. There comes a time when a husband must serve his wife. For you, that day has come. Ask, give her whatever she wants. Take her outside with you for fresh air. Show her the best scenes. And don't hurt her heart for any reason. got it OK, go. Ganga, why did father give me this lecture? Didn't understand? You used to be the youngest in this house. Now someone younger than you is going to come. Rajni is going to be a mother, I am a father. Blessings to you, Ganga. But why did father ask me to buy saffron? Does Rajni want to eat sweets? No, saffron with milk for a pregnant woman… ...if given, the unborn child will be malnourished. is it? Then I will bring a lot of saffron. - Did you hear? It has happened. - What happened? Pregnancy? What happened to him? - Looks like dad is done. - Shut up. why don't you cry I die...? you idiot. Oh my god, isn't that enough, you're going to give me another one? stupid woman I told you to go to your mother's house. - But you didn't listen. - Do you listen to me or just fight? Do I fight, or do you give me more trouble? - I'm not pregnant. - So who? - Raj is pregnant. - It's worse. I'm trying to root out this family, but it's getting stronger. We came here for a picnic, but you started painting here too. - It's about to be done. - Shall I turn around? - Wait a little longer. - How long do I have to stay like this? Two more minutes. Well, you can see it now. - Did you draw a child's picture today? - Yes, what do you think about it? you're handsome. And so is your picture. - This is not an ordinary child. - No, it's really beautiful. That's our waiting baby. The gift you are going to give me after marriage. He will be like this. He should be like this. Rajni, this is how I envisioned my child. - How do you think about him? - Why should I think? I know how my child is. - How? - I, tell you? - Yes. - Wait. How will he be? like this "He will be dearer than the moon" "And more beautiful than flowers." "He will dance at our house" "Our Little Baby" "He will be dearer than the moon" "And more beautiful than flowers." "He will dance at our house" "Our Little Baby" "He shall be like a blossoming bud." "He will say" "He shall be like a blossoming bud." "He will say" "Dad, Mom, Baba..." "Let's Catch the Moon and the Stars" "And more beautiful than flowers." "He will dance at our house" "Our Little Baby" "He is still hidden, like a pearl in a shell" "He is still hidden, like a pearl in a shell" "From fairyland, our son must be coming" "He will be dearer than the moon" "And more beautiful than flowers." "He will dance at our house" "Our Little Baby" My dear, won't your grandfather come? my baby Rajni sit down. what is this dad Do you play with toys? so what? I am happy that my grandson has arrived. Now you receive these keys. Take all the jewels from the safe and put them on. Why are you waiting? take Ganga, go with her too. God, the house where I was born. I grew up in trouble. I never thought that I would marry into such a rich family. I am scared. Save me, Lord. save me Daughter-in-law, is this you, or a goddess dressed? I am very happy. Get, wear these too. Come on daughter. Look Parvati, your daughter-in-law has come all dressed up. Although you are the lady of this house. Always wore a cotton saree. I bought you many jewels, but you kept them safe. You always said that your daughter-in-law should wear them. I have fulfilled all your wishes today. Look at your niece. Look Parvati. Bless her to always live in her husband's shadow. She can wear diamonds and precious stones. Bless her and Ram to be happy always. Parvati has come. She has come to bless you. She blesses you. Ganga, have you seen your madam? Did you see Parvati? You brought me here to tell me something important, didn't you? - Then tell me. - Sit down. Chanda, the doctor said... ...that my arm cannot be fixed. But your right arm was broken. That's right. I learned about the left hand only later. is it! Ruin the life of a beautiful girl like you... ...A disabled person like me has no rights. - God will give you a good life partner. - Thank you. Yesterday, my brother said that there have been three suggestions about me. They are waiting for my consent. One boy was a high official in Delhi. The other is a Superintendent of Police from Jalandhar. The third, a useless person like you. But he is rich, he can have thousands of servants. Bali, who to choose as my life partner? You, have mercy on me. help me Which of these three should I choose? Why are you silent? - tell me. - I will tell you. "Mr. came very proud" "Beautiful and well dressed" "Where are you going now with your eyes down" "Oh my love" "Seeing your wounded hand hurts my heart" "As long as I live, my path cannot be changed" "You can take my word for it." "Mr. came very proud" "You may hate me, but accept it." "Let me see you leave me and love someone else" "You wouldn't dare." "Mr. came very proud" He asked me to give this letter to madam. - Where is the husband now? - In the club. OK give it to me, I will give it to madam. daughter in law. Ram has sent this letter for you. He sent a letter, what's the rush? - How do I know? - To me, read it. How can an illiterate man read? Get your letter. what am i doing Read this article to me. I'm going to play a game. I will read it for you when I come back. listen What letter is it? Maybe a letter from dad asking for a donation. No, it's a letter from your brother. - From brother...? - Yes. Please read it for me. No. He doesn't know what he wrote. Therefore, if you read this letter, it is a sin. - Take, I will not read it. - Please. - No. what am i doing Who do I ask to read this article? If my family finds out that I am illiterate... ...They start hating me. Ram, who are they? They might be your friends. - He is my uncle. - Welcome. - Come on, sit down. Sit comfortably. slowly... You must have had dinner. I just finished eating too. - Uncle. - Ram, there is your dinner. Go eat before it gets cold. alone? Ram invited us for dinner tonight. We are starving. Ram, if you want to treat so many friends... ...should have been notified earlier. I sent a letter to Rajni. Please sit quietly. - Sorry, I'll be back. - Ram's uncle scared us. - Eat bread. - After dinner. - Did you come back? - Why are you sitting in the dark? - Is everything ready? - What things? what things All my friends are here, won't you give them dinner? I will be ready in five minutes. Now get ready, what joke is this? What happened next? Eat two pounds of sweets and win 50 rupees. - How did you manage to eat so much? - Because it's free - Is dinner ready? - Sorry, it's getting ready. You didn't even invite us to your wedding. Call your wife and we'll see her. Be patient. Until Mrs. Ram comes dressed. After all, she is a rich man's daughter-in-law. To wear clothes and jewelry for her… ...will take about 15 minutes. She must be applying lipstick now. sister in law. You are worrying unnecessarily. How can you cook for so many people so quickly? I will order food from the hotel. - Until then you serve tea to the guests. - Okay. Ram, we are very hungry. At least give us some soup. - Something small or... - Here it is. Ram, we are anxious to see your wife. But she doesn't come down. She sent tea with the maid. She is not a servant, she is the pride of this house. She is Ram's wife, Rajni. - Is she Ram's wife? - Yes. How much bragging did he do in college? He said he was bringing a flower from the Garden of Eden. - If she is Kala Varna...? - Kanchan, be quiet. Why read so much about Ram's wife's Kaala Varna? What else can the poor do? By God she is beautiful. But a pigeon is afraid of a cat... ...as if her husband is afraid of her. This woman is ordinary, but her husband is handsome. Such inconsistencies are common in life. Uncle, your story doesn't fit. She is my wife, she is his wife. What's the difference? A fair-skinned person gets a kaala-varna partner. A fair-skinned person gets a fair-skinned partner. - Uncle. - Why are you angry with me? Take them to a hotel if they want to be treated. - are you leaving? - I leave. - Welcome. - It's okay, we'll eat some other time. You are going to Delhi tomorrow. We will meet you at the airport. Let's go. What a disgrace to me. - Have your dinner. - Dinner? Since when did you wait for an opportunity to insult me? - No. - What is not? If not look, at least use your brain. Don't know how to present yourself in front of guests? - It's not. - So what else? If so, God made you very beautiful. Were you not ashamed to appear like a maid in front of guests? You are fully responsible for the home... Do you want to transfer to...? Don't get angry. You suddenly come and cook for so many people... -...that confused me. - Suddenly? Didn't I send you a letter from the club? tell me. - Yes. - Did you not receive the letter? - Received. - You haven't read it. You don't have time. You are a rich man's daughter-in-law. Pride has overcome you. No, don't say that, I swear I never think that. So you read it and ignored it. You don't care about me. I had written in the letter that I am going to Delhi tomorrow. That some of my friends are coming over for dinner. I asked you to keep dinner ready. Didn't you read it? - No, I didn't. - why not? Is my article of no importance to you? - Don't hit me. - I don't want to hit you. But why didn't you read the article? - I... - Tell me. I can't read... can't read. What did you say, you can't read? Can't my wife read, Rajni, are you illiterate? I didn't get time to study. I lost my parents when I was young. Then sister Chanda was very small. All my time was spent looking after her and cooking for them. I thought it was my duty to take care of Chanda and teach. I thought our house would be destroyed. So I didn't focus on my education and happiness. You have kept me in the dark so far. When I asked you to read a book, you made some excuses. You really tricked me. No, don't get me wrong, I apologize to you. So why didn't you tell me this until today? - I didn't consider it necessary - It wasn't necessary...? It is very important to me. It does not matter if a man is blind, he must have an educated brain. Now I realize that I have this deficiency. Give me a chance. You teach me and I will learn quickly. This is a disgrace. Is this your age, or your children's learning age? It's not your fault. This is my fault because I took pity on you and married you. I thought your life would be ruined if I refused. But it's like I cut off my own leg. I lost my own passions. I made my father my enemy. But now the world condemns me. It's not just that I married an ugly woman... ...for being with an ignorant person. Yes, the world must condemn me. I have to kill myself for marrying you. I wonder what sins I am paying for. My life is ruined. Yes, your life is ruined. And I am the reason for that. An ugly woman like me is handsome like you... ...not fit to be the wife of an educated man. I had realized that a long time ago. An unfortunate woman like me should have died long ago. But you came and gave me the message of life. You gave me that happiness. If my death can get you a suitable wife… ...I want to die now. God gave me a good husband so I will feel comforted. It is because I am a married woman who is leaving this world. The days when you suffered silently with me. Forget them and forgive me. I have lived more than I should have lived. I want to die now. What happened Rajni? Doc, how about my niece? Why not talk? - I am sorry. - What happened? She lost her child due to trauma. Is the child lost? Will I not be able to see my grandson now? I will not be able to see my grandson's face. She should rest. come here Behold, thy brother is come again. - Take the umbrella inside the house. - Yes. How is Rajni? What can I say about her? She used to be Kalavarna. Now her face glows golden. - Really? - Yes, Ram gave her that much gold ornaments. Wonder how he carried it, it weighs a ton. I forgot. Rajni wears two diamond rings on her fingers. They are so bright that you don't need to light a lamp at night. It's so light. I heard you came to our mansion... ...that the guard kicked you out when you arrived. You should have told him my name. I said, that's why he kicked me out. Does that mean that everything that has been said so far is a lie? You, tell us about Rajni. Rajni was three months pregnant. - My sister... - Is Rajni pregnant? Yes, but not now. She lost her child. Damn you cursed bro. You never gave us details about Rajni. After marriage you did not allow us to meet her. I will go and ask my son-in-law. Who to ask? Your son-in-law has gone to Delhi. To Delhi, what is it for? He is a painter. He has gone to a competition. When he returns, I myself will go and ask him. Why are you not giving us any news about the daughter? Everyone has the right to fight for their rights. But don't call this my name, I believe in peace. Oh my God, how is Rajni? Ganga, the person who was to come left without showing his face to us. Disaster came before the joy. What is broken is a dream. If this marriage had been done properly, this would not have happened. The elders were right. "How to end a bad beginning well" Ganga remove all these toys. Sir, you have chosen all these toys and bought them. God cannot be cruel enough not to impregnate Rajni again. Another baby will play with these. Will I live that long? The one who was going to play with these toys… ...left without playing with them. We don't need them now. No, we should not build palaces in the sky. It's a mistake. Get rid of these toys. - daughter in law? - Queen, you? - How are you now? - I am fine. - Did Ram send a letter? - No. A strange person. He left you and went to Delhi. Couldn't he at least ask about your health in a letter? It is useless for him to write. It is only useful if she can read. Don't know Rajni letters? Can't Rajini read and write? Go... you go. Don't bother me anymore, go away. "He will be dearer than the moon" "And more beautiful than flowers." "He will dance at our house" "Our Little Baby" You were his dream. He asked me for a fair and beautiful gift. For that he gave me saffron milk. If you survived, all my sorrows would be gone. He will forget that I am old and ignorant. But you are just a picture. Are you just sitting there making me nervous? No, I don't want to keep you here. You go too. Go. my child I killed you. I am your killer, I killed you. I am a sinner. Why do you hurt yourself? Some things are lost before they are gained. Some lose after gaining. Who can fight against fate? But Ganga is not supposed to get anything for me. My destiny is only for destruction. I know you have always faced frustration. But just imagine, with your selfless service… ...Your father-in-law's health improves. What will happen to him if you fail him? If not for you, smile for him, try to be happy. Yes, in sorrow I forgot my duty. After marriage, a young woman to keep her husband happy... ...or better to remind me about keeping his family happy. Niece, this toy. Playing with these inanimate toys... ...I couldn't give someone to my father. That's why they told you to throw it all away. Take, throw away all these lifeless toys. "He's still hiding..." "...like a pearl in a shell" "He's still hiding..." "...like a pearl in a shell" "From Fairyland,..." "...our baby must be coming" Sister-in-law, you, this time? I have come to plead before you. Don't you discourage me. Someone like a son, would you say that to your mother? For you, I try to do everything possible. I promise you. Tell me, what do you want? Bali, I have eyes, but there is no light in them. That light called education. I came to ask for that understanding. - Do you want to become literate? - Yes. If I had not been ignorant that day Ram would have... ...will not be humiliated in front of friends. And this house is not drowning in sorrow. I was so sad about not getting education that day... ...I've never regretted it so much before. Please teach me to read and write. I will start tutoring you from tomorrow. I am sure, with your dedication and my efforts, you will learn quickly. If that happens, I will think that I got a new life. It is my duty to comply with your request. I will start tutoring you from tomorrow. I have a lot of things to do in the morning and take care of dad in the afternoon. I will come when I have time. If you spare some time for me, that would be great. OK, I'll do that. - But don't let anyone know. - Why is that? I feel ashamed. This is the right age for my children to learn... -...not my study. - Okay. - Why is this? - I'm very sorry. Look where you're going. Key Rebellion. I am very happy to have you. How did you get the Key Rebellion? It had fallen to the ground. That's why you hit me, right? Why did you open this? To know if these are its keys. This is your own home. If you did this elsewhere… ...calling you a thief. Give me the key riot. I didn't steal, I caught so much money for the first time. - Give me this. - You have no right to keep it. I have no right to give it to you. - give me. - take Daughter-in-law, don't tell anyone this. - Dad... - Put it. - I will go. - You're going fast these days, what's the matter? She is still weak, she probably needs to rest. Go rest, girl. - Do you need anything else? - No, sleep. A poor girl. She always tries to be happy. - have you eaten? - I will eat. No, go eat first. your choice. By your kindness, I have learned a lot in these few days. Hope that day comes soon, I will fulfill your wishes. She called me a thief. I am not a thief. Like I'm stealing his money. Brother, are you sleeping or awake? a fool You wake me up and ask me whether I am asleep or not. Why do you roam around the house like a ghost at night? If you hear this, you won't be able to sleep for the rest of your life. - what is that? - I'll tell you. what...? I will not leave you. Let me tell you. I have been seeing this sin for a long time. I didn't come to tell you. But it is now going beyond the limit. If you don't believe Maw, come and see for yourself now. I will see for myself. I will not spare you. come with me see. See for yourself. That day when Rajni was fed to Bali... this fire in our house... ...We never thought it would happen. Because our hearts are pure. - But the embers are very clearly visible today. - Shut up. Sister-in-law, what is written? - This is possible. - It shouldn't be possible. - I forgot to write that word. - Sister-in-law, pencil. - Let's stop here for today. - Okay. Put them here. I will look and fix it. I did not expect to improve so much in a few days. shall i go what time tomorrow After dad went to sleep. Little woman! Now I understand why you left me early. It's amazing how long this crime has been going on here. - father. - You are an immoral woman. Aren't you ashamed? Didn't you understand that a brother-in-law is like a son? Dad, think before you speak. Rogue! Don't you realize she looks like your mother? Not like, she is my mother. Do not accuse such a righteous relationship. An accusation, such a scandalous affair? How can we blame our son? If this immoral woman had not come here... ...our son is not misbehaving. Ram is out of town and this woman starts flying. God, what is this! A sister-in-law would never push her brother like this. Aunty, I beg you. If you hate me, kill me. Even I am a woman. In front of adults I... ...Don't insult me ​​with such accusations. A shameless woman. Now what shame do you have left? At least don't talk like that. I came from a poor family. I may lose money, I have only the wealth of my honor. What I can never let go of. Do you think your tears will wash away your sins? Dad! listen The sister-in-law is innocent. Innocent? Then what did she come to your room at night for? - She was here to study. - Study or teach? Brother, are there sinners in this house? After my sister's death... ...She is the root of evil. She is a sinner. That is why God took away her child. - Oh, my God. - She should be happy. Why does she want a child? uncle Bali! Did you even forget that he is your uncle? Uncle...? No, he is a devil. Not only has he insulted my sister-in-law… ...He also insulted my mother. He is a devil, aunt is a witch. You can never be happy in this house as long as you two are there. As long as you two stay, this house will be a den of sin. Get out of here. I don't even want to see your face. - Both of you get out of here. - Don't be so quick, sir. Be quiet Ganga. These two cannot stay in this house anymore Go now. If you don't go, I will. I will go. Don't kill my cousin. Get out of here. Here is the key rebellion. Brother in law I did not sleep all night. I thought what happened yesterday I... ...that the whole world will say that he did it. I'm leaving this house. Okay, you go. brother in law! I said I was going, did you agree? But how can I leave home empty-handed? did you forget When you die, you say sister... ...I am an orphan and you should take care of me. I am not asking for the whole property. I'm not greedy. But if you can buy a small shop and a big house... ...I will go. ok My dear fellow painters and brothers and sisters. After a month, the judges... ... has selected two best paintings. One is Miss Ram's picture and the other is Miss Lakshmanarayan's picture. And from these two... ...Mr. Lakshminarayan has been named as the winner. There is no doubt that Mr. Ram has drawn a wonderful picture But his painting attracts the eye and not the heart. Mohan, what have you done? Why is an educated, intelligent man like you addicted to alcohol? I don't understand what's wrong with you. Your father has left you many things. After that, you even married the girl you loved. Don't mention that petty woman. I consider her dead. She has been dead for a long time. what do you mean Padma is educated, intelligent and beautiful. Beautiful...? Her beauty stole my life. She destroyed me. I married her against my parents' wishes. I was captivated by her beauty and admired her. But she... Don't let me talk, Ram. What happened to Padma? She is misguided, Ram. I drank alcohol to forget myself. I am a coward, or I should have died a long time ago. I'm sorry Mohan. I am really very sorry. Remember when we studied together in college... ...We always talked about beauty. But that is the immaturity of our youth. Love and beauty are another thing. Marriage and wife, something else. Only the eyes can please the beauty of a young woman. The heart cannot rest. To live your life well, you need a girl with character. So she is neither beautiful nor educated. Who is your soulmate, supporting you every step of the way? Life taught me this lesson. Sister-in-law, it's late now and I'm going to the hotel. We don't want you to stay at the hotel. This is like your home. Can't you live here? - No, that's not right. - If your heart is pure... ...why think about the world? I don't care about myself or the world. I regret accusing my sister-in-law. She was thrown out of the house. That also happened when my brother was not at home. Can anyone have such a heartless father? I will go. Sister, how long have you been suffering? Chanda, your cousin is very nice. But I fear his anger. I wonder what will happen when he returns from Delhi. I shudder even thinking about it. Ganga, where is Rajni? what's the point Why are you silent? What happened to Rajni, where is she? I will tell you. Tell me quickly, I'm nervous. What happened to her, where is she? I wish she was dead. What is the matter, uncle? Rajni and Bali brought disgrace to the family. - Uncle, what did you say? - It is true. Who said that? Tell me the truth or I won't let you. - Who saw it? - I saw it. Did you see it? tell me the truth Why are you shouting? It will not restore our lost dignity. Did someone tell you, or did you see it yourself? kill me I cannot commit suicide because of my wife's immorality. Tell me about these events that happened when I was away. I am ashamed to say this. I saw your lady in Bali's room late at night. When I asked the reason, she started making excuses. Ganga, where is Rajni? Is she dead or alive? She now lives with her brother. Go and bring her here now. Go. - I am innocent. - I trust you. I trust you completely. I knew my husband would not misunderstand me. I am not stupid enough to believe anything anyone says You will not be sent home. Your love is my life, queen. I can't lose it. - Brother, trust me, after you're gone... - Shut up, Bali. The accusation against you is very wrong. I don't even need an explanation. I don't know about my brother? I want to know who did this damage. Who else but your immoral wife? I kicked her out of the house. How did you bring her back? I brought her here to do justice to her. Look at her face. Does she look like a sinner to you? She served you the whole time. How does your heart accuse her? You have many valuable things. You can set a price for them. But the chastity of a chaste woman cannot be put at a price. You are stupid and immature. Listen to your father. You don't know who your wife is. I know about my wife, you don't know about your daughter-in-law. I know about my brother, you don't know about your son. - What, I don't know about my son? - No, you don't know. What do you have to do with us? Have you given us the love of a father longing for a child? Have you ever addressed us as ``son''? When Bali broke his arm, you didn't even look at him. Have you ever wondered what we both do? No one has seen us living as sons and fathers in this house. Although there is money in this house, there is no unity. Respect is maintained, but love is not. If you've noticed this before... ...such an impure creation of an impure mind... ...talk about something horrible? This is not a design, I saw it. How embarrassing. Whoever said this should be fired. Are you saying this yourself? Father, kill Rajni if ​​you like. But I can't stand her being accused like this. - You are crazy. - Even if I'm mad, I don't doubt Rajni. are you arguing with me Then leave my house. You all get out of my house.
